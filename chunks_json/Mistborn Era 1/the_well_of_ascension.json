The Lord Ruler - the man who\nclaimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand\nyears - has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that\ntriumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world\nhas been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now\nthe most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young\nnobleman she loves. As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is\nnow venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her\nintensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun\nbehaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange\nvaporous entity that haunts her.\nStopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the\nleast of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire,\ndoesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who\nlead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political\nskills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them\ncomposed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign\nof the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful\nallomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems\nto offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where\nto find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.\nTHE WELL OF ASCENSION\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPART ONE\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nPART TWO\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nPART THREE\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\nPART FOUR\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\nPART FIVE\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\nPART SIX\n56\n57\n58\n59\nEPILOGUE\nARS ARCANUM"

Emily, I love you!\nPART ONE\nHEIR OF THE SURVIVOR\nI write these words in steel, for anything not set in metal cannot be\ntrusted.\n1\nTHE ARMY CREPT LIKE A dark stain across the horizon.\nKing Elend Venture stood motionless upon the Luthadel city wall,\nlooking out at the enemy troops. Around him, ash fell from the sky in fat,\nlazy flakes. It wasn't the burnt white ash that one saw in dead coals; this was\na deeper, harsher black ash. The Ashmounts had been particularly active\nlately.\nElend felt the ash dust his face and clothing, but he ignored it. In the\ndistance, the bloody red sun was close to setting. It backlit the army that\nhad come to take Elend's kingdom from him.\n\"How many?\" Elend asked quietly.\n\"Fifty thousand, we think,\" Ham said, leaning against the parapet,\nbeefy arms folded on the stone. Like everything in the city, the wall had\nbeen stained black by countless years of ashfalls.\n\"Fifty thousand soldiers. . .\" Elend said, trailing off. Despite heavy\nrecruitment, Elend barely had twenty thousand men under his command—\nand they were peasants with less than a year of training. Maintaining even\nthat small number was straining his resources. If they'd been able to find the\nLord Ruler's atium, perhaps things would be different. As it was, Elend's\nrule was in serious danger of economic disaster.\n\"What do you think?\" Elend asked.\n\"I don't know, El,\" Ham said quietly. \"Kelsier was always the one with\nthe vision.\"\n\"But you helped him plan,\" Elend said. \"You and the others, you were\nhis crew. You were the ones who came up with a strategy for overthrowing\nthe empire, then made it happen.\"\nHam fell silent, and Elend felt as if he knew what the man was\nthinking. Kelsier was central to it all. He was the one who organized, the\none who took all of the wild brain-storming and turned it into a viable\noperation. He was the leader. The genius.\nAnd he'd died a year before, on the very same day that the people—as\npart of his secret plan—had risen up in fury to overthrow their god emperor.\nElend had taken the throne in the ensuing chaos. Now it was looking more\nand more like he would lose everything that Kelsier and his crew had\nworked so hard to accomplish. Lose it to a tyrant who might be even worse\nthan the Lord Ruler. A petty, devious bully in \"noble\" form. The man who\nhad marched his army on Luthadel.\nElend's own father, Straff Venture.\n\"Any chance you can. . .talk him out of attacking?\" Ham asked.\n\"Maybe,\" Elend said hesitantly. \"Assuming the Assembly doesn't just\nsurrender the city.\"\n\"They close?\"\n\"I don't know, honestly. I worry that they are. That army has frightened"

That army has frightened\nthem, Ham.\" And with good reason, he thought. \"Anyway, I have a proposal\nfor the meeting in two days. I'll try to talk them out of doing anything rash.\nDockson got back today, right?\"\nHam nodded. \"Just before the army's advance.\"\n\"I think we should call a meeting of the crew,\" Elend said. \"See if we\ncan come up with a way out of this.\"\n\"We'll still be pretty shorthanded,\" Ham said, rubbing his chin. \"Spook\nisn't supposed to be back for another week, and the Lord Ruler only knows\nwhere Breeze went. We haven't had a message from him in months.\"\nElend sighed, shaking his head. \"I can't think of anything else, Ham.\"\nHe turned, staring out over the ashen landscape again. The army was\nlighting campfires as the sun set. Soon, the mists would appear.\nI need to get back to the palace and work on that proposal, Elend\nthought.\n\"Where'd Vin run off to?\" Ham asked, turning back to Elend.\nElend paused. \"You know,\" he said, \"I'm not sure.\"\nVin landed softly on the damp cobblestones, watching as the mists\nbegan to form around her. They puffed into existence as darkness fell,\ngrowing like tangles of translucent vines, twisting and wrapping around one\nanother.\nThe great city of Luthadel was still. Even now, a year after the Lord\nRuler's death and the rise of Elend's new free government, the common\npeople stayed in their homes at night. They feared the mists, a tradition that\nwent far deeper than the Lord Ruler's laws.\nVin slipped forward quietly, senses alert. Inside herself, as always, she\nburned tin and pewter. Tin enhanced her senses, making it easier for her to\nsee in the night. Pewter made her body stronger, made her lighter on her\nfeet. These, along with copper—which had the power to hide her use of\nAllomancy from others who were burning bronze—were metals that she\nleft on almost all the time.\nSome called her paranoid. She thought herself prepared. Either way,\nthe habit had saved her life on numerous occasions.\nShe approached a quiet street corner and paused, peeking out. She'd\nnever really understood how she burned metals; she could remember doing\nit for as long as she'd been alive, using Allomancy instinctively even before\nshe was formally trained by Kelsier. It didn't really matter to her. She wasn't\nlike Elend; she didn't need a logical explanation for everything. For Vin, it\nwas enough that when she swallowed bits of metal, she was able to draw\nupon their power.\nPower she appreciated, for she well knew what it was like to lack it.\nEven now, she was not what one would likely envision as a warrior. Slight\nof frame and barely five feet tall, with dark hair and pale skin, she knew she\nhad an almost frail look about her. She no longer displayed the underfed\nlook she had during her childhood on the streets, but she certainly wasn't\nsomeone any man would find intimidating."

        "text": "had an almost frail look about her. She no longer displayed the underfed\nlook she had during her childhood on the streets, but she certainly wasn't\nsomeone any man would find intimidating.\nShe liked that. It gave her an edge—and she needed every edge she\ncould get.\nShe also liked the night. During the day, Luthadel was cramped and\nconfining despite its size. But at night the mists fell like a deep cloud. They\ndampened, softened, shaded. Massive keeps became shadowed mountains,\nand crowded tenements melted together like a chandler's rejected wares.\nVin crouched beside her building, still watching the intersection.\nCarefully, she reached within herself and burned steel—one of the other\nmetals she'd swallowed earlier. Immediately, a group of translucent blue\nlines sprang up around her. Visible only to her eyes, the lines pointed from\nher chest to nearby sources of metal—all metals, no matter what type. The\nthickness of the lines was proportionate to the size of the metal pieces they\nmet. Some pointed to bronze door latches, others to crude iron nails holding\nboards together.\nShe waited silently. None of the lines moved. Burning steel was an\neasy way to tell if someone was moving nearby. If they were wearing bits of\nmetal, they would trail telltale moving lines of blue. Of course, that wasn't\nthe main purpose of steel. Vin reached her hand carefully into her belt\npouch and pulled out one of the many coins that sat within, muffled by cloth\nbatting. Like all other bits of metal, this coin had a blue line extending from\nits center to Vin's chest.\nShe flipped the coin into the air, then mentally grabbed its line and—\nburning steel—Pushed on the coin. The bit of metal shot into the air, arcing\nthrough the mists, forced away by the Push. It plinked to the ground in the\nmiddle of the street.\nThe mists continued to spin. They were thick and mysterious, even to\nVin. More dense than a simple fog and more constant than any normal\nweather pattern, they churned and flowed, making rivulets around her. Her\neyes could pierce them; tin made her sight more keen. The night seemed\nlighter to her, the mists less thick. Yet, they were still there.\nA shadow moved in the city square, responding to her coin—which\nshe had Pushed out into the square as a signal. Vin crept forward, and\nrecognized OreSeur the kandra. He wore a different body than he had a year\nago, during the days when he had acted the part of Lord Renoux. Yet, this\nbalding, nondescript body had now become just as familiar to Vin.\nOreSeur met up with her. \"Did you find what you were looking for,\nMistress?\" he asked, tone respectful—yet somehow still a little hostile. As\nalways.\nVin shook her head, glancing around in the darkness. \"Maybe I was\nwrong,\" she said. \"Maybe I wasn't being followed.\" The acknowledgment\nmade her a bit sad. She'd been looking forward to sparring with the Watcher\nagain tonight. She still didn't even know who he was; the first night, she'd\nmistaken him for an assassin. And maybe he was. Yet, he seemed to display\nvery little interest in Elend—and a whole lot of interest in Vin."

Yet, he seemed to display\nvery little interest in Elend—and a whole lot of interest in Vin.\n\"We should go back to the wall,\" Vin decided, standing up. \"Elend will\nbe wondering where I went.\"\nOreSeur nodded. At that moment, a burst of coins shot through the\nmists, spraying toward Vin.\nI have begun to wonder if I am the only sane man left. Can the others\nnot see? They have been waiting so long for their hero to come—the one\nspoken of in Terris prophecies—that they quickly jump between conclusions,\npresuming that each story and legend applies to this one man.\n2\nVIN REACTED IMMEDIATELY, SPRINGING AWAY. She moved\nwith incredible speed, tasseled cloak swirling as she skidded across the wet\ncobblestones. The coins hit the ground behind her, throwing up chips of\nstone, then leaving trails in the mist as they ricocheted away.\n\"OreSeur, go!\" she snapped, though he was already fleeing toward a\nnearby alleyway.\nVin spun into a low crouch, hands and feet on the cool stones,\nAllomantic metals flaring in her stomach. She burned steel, watching the\ntranslucent blue lines appear around her. She waited, tense, watching for. . .\nAnother group of coins shot from the dark mists, each one trailing a\nblue line. Vin immediately flared steel and Pushed against the coins,\ndeflecting them out into the darkness.\nThe night fell still again.\nThe street around her was wide—for Luthadel—though tenements rose\nhigh on either side. Mist spun lazily, making the ends of the street disappear\ninto a haze.\nA group of eight men appeared from the mists and approached. Vin\nsmiled. She had been right: Someone was following her. These men\nweren't, however, the Watcher. They didn't have his solid grace, his sense of\npower. These men were something far more blunt. Assassins.\nIt made sense. If she had just arrived with an army to conquer\nLuthadel, the first thing she'd have done was send in a group of\nAllomancers to kill Elend.\nShe felt a sudden pressure at her side, and she cursed as she was\nthrown off balance, her coin pouch jerking away from her waist. She ripped\nits string free, letting the enemy Allomancer Push the coins away from her.\nThe assassins had at least one Coinshot—a Misting who had the power to\nburn steel and Push on metals. In fact, two of the assassins trailed blue lines\npointing to coin pouches of their own. Vin considered returning the favor\nand Pushing their pouches away, but hesitated. No need to play her hand\nyet. She might need those coins.\nWithout coins of her own, she couldn't attack from a distance.\nHowever, if this was a good team, then attacking from a distance would be\npointless—their Coinshots and Lurchers would be ready to deal with shot\ncoins. Fleeing wasn't an option either. These men hadn't come for her alone;\nif she fled, they'd continue on to their real goal.\nNobody sent assassins to kill bodyguards. Assassins killed important\nmen.

The man she\nloved.\nVin flared pewter—body growing tense, alert, dangerous. Four Thugs\nat the front, she thought, eyeing the advancing men. The pewter burners\nwould be inhumanly strong, capable of surviving a great deal of physical\npunishment. Very dangerous up close. And the one carrying the wooden\nshield is a Lurcher.\nShe feinted forward, causing the approaching Thugs to jump\nbackward. Eight Mistings against one Mistborn was decent odds for them—\nbut only if they were careful. The two Coinshots moved up the sides of the\nstreet, so that they'd be able to Push at her from both directions. The last\nman, standing quietly beside the Lurcher, had to be a Smoker—relatively\nunimportant in a fight, his purpose was to hide his team from enemy\nAllomancers.\nEight Mistings. Kelsier could have done it; he'd killed an Inquisitor.\nShe wasn't Kelsier, however. She had yet to decide if that was a bad or a\ngood thing.\nVin took a deep breath, wishing she had a bit of atium to spare, and\nburned iron. This let her Pull on a nearby coin—one of those that had been\nshot at her—much as steel would have let her Push on it. She caught it,\ndropped it, then jumped, making as if to Push on the coin and shoot herself\ninto the air.\nOne of the Coinshots, however, Pushed against the coin, shooting it\naway. Since Allomancy would only let a person Push directly away from—\nor Pull directly toward—their body, Vin was left without a decent anchor.\nPushing against the coin would only shoot her sideways.\nShe dropped back to the ground.\nLet them think they have me trapped, she thought, crouching in the\ncenter of the street. The Thugs approached a little more confidently. Yes, Vin\nthought. I know what you're thinking. This is the Mistborn who killed the\nLord Ruler? This scrawny thing? Can it be possible?\nI wonder the same thing myself.\nThe first Thug ducked in to attack, and Vin burst into motion. Obsidian\ndaggers flashed in the night as she ripped them free from their sheaths, and\nblood sprayed black in the darkness as she ducked beneath the Thug's staff\nand slashed her weapons across his thighs.\nThe man cried out. The night was no longer silent.\nMen cursed as Vin moved through them. The Thug's partner attacked\nher—blurringly fast, his muscles fueled by pewter. His staff whipped a\ntassel from Vin's mistcloak as she threw herself to the ground, then pushed\nherself back up out of a third Thug's reach.\nA spray of coins flew toward her. Vin reached out and Pushed on them.\nThe Coinshot, however, continued to Push—and Vin's Push smashed\nagainst his.\nPushing and Pulling metals was all about weight. And—with the coins\nbetween them—that meant Vin's weight was slammed against the assassin's\nweight. Both were tossed backward. Vin shot out of a Thug's reach; the\nCoinshot fell to the ground."

Vin shot out of a Thug's reach; the\nCoinshot fell to the ground.\nA flurry of coins came at her from the other direction. Still tumbling in\nthe air, Vin flared steel, giving herself an extra burst of power. Blue lines\nwere a jumbled mess, but she didn't need to isolate the coins to Push them\nall away.\nThis Coinshot let go of his missiles as soon as he felt Vin's touch. The\nbits of metal scattered out into the mists.\nVin hit the cobblestones shoulder-first. She rolled—flaring pewter to\nenhance her balance—and flipped to her feet. At the same time, she burned\niron and Pulled hard on the disappearing coins.\nThey shot back toward her. As soon as they got close, Vin jumped to\nthe side and Pushed them toward the approaching Thugs. The coins,\nhowever, immediately veered away, twisting through the mists toward the\nLurcher. He was unable to Push the coins away—like all Mistings, he only\nhad one Allomantic power, and his was to Pull with iron.\nHe did this effectively, protecting the Thugs. He raised his shield and\ngrunted from the impact as the coins hit it and bounced away.\nVin was already moving again. She ran directly for the now exposed\nCoinshot to her left, the one who had fallen to the ground. The man yelped\nin surprise, and the other Coinshot tried to distract Vin, but he was too slow.\nThe Coinshot died with a dagger in his chest. He was no Thug; he\ncouldn't burn pewter to enhance his body. Vin pulled out her dagger, then\nyanked his pouch free. He gurgled quietly and collapsed back to the stones.\nOne, Vin thought, spinning, sweat flying from her brow. She now\nfaced seven men down the corridor-like street. They probably expected her\nto flee. Instead, she charged.\nAs she got close to the Thugs, she jumped—then threw down the\npouch she'd taken from the dying man. The remaining Coinshot cried out,\nimmediately Pushing it away. Vin, however, got some lift from the coins,\nthrowing herself in a leap directly over the heads of the Thugs.\nOne of them—the wounded one—had unfortunately been smart\nenough to remain behind to protect the Coinshot. The Thug raised his\ncudgel as Vin landed. She ducked his first attack, raised her dagger, and—\nA blue line danced into her vision. Quick. Vin reacted immediately,\ntwisting and Pushing against a door latch to throw herself out of the way.\nShe hit the ground on her side, then flung herself up with one hand. She\nlanded skidding on mist-wetted feet.\nA coin hit the ground behind her, bouncing against the cobbles. It\nhadn't come close to hitting her. In fact, it had seemed aimed at the\nremaining assassin Coinshot. He'd probably been forced to Push it away.\nBut who had fired it?\nOreSeur? Vin wondered. But, that was foolish. The kandra was no\nAllomancer—and besides, he wouldn't have taken the initiative. OreSeur\ndid only what he was expressly told.\nThe assassin Coinshot looked equally confused. Vin glanced up,"

The Watcher.\nThe Watcher remained atop his perch, offering no further interference\nas the Thugs rushed Vin. She cursed as she found three staves coming at her\nat once. She ducked one, spun around the other, then planted a dagger in the\nchest of the man holding the third. He stumbled backward, but didn't drop.\nPewter kept him on his feet.\nWhy did the Watcher interfere? Vin thought as she jumped away. Why\nwould he shoot that coin at a Coinshot who could obviously Push it away?\nHer preoccupation with the Watcher nearly cost her her life as an\nunnoticed Thug charged her from the side. It was the man whose legs she'd\nslashed. Vin reacted-just in time to dodge his blow. This, however, put her\ninto range of the other three.\nAll attacked at once.\nShe actually managed to twist out of the way of two of the strikes.\nOne, however, crashed into her side. The powerful blow tossed her across\nthe street, and she collided with a shop's wooden door. She heard a crack—\nfrom the door, fortunately, and not her bones—and she slumped to the\nground, daggers lost. A normal person would be dead. Her pewter-\nstrengthened body, however, was tougher than that.\nShe gasped for breath, forcing herself up to her feet, and flared tin. The\nmetal enhanced her senses—including her sense of pain—and the sudden\nshock cleared her mind. Her side ached where she'd been struck. But she\ncouldn't stop. Not with a Thug charging her, swinging his staff in an\noverhead blow.\nCrouching before the doorway, Vin flared pewter and caught the staff\nin both hands. She growled, pulling back her left hand, then cracking her\nfist against the weapon, shattering the fine hardwood in a single blow. The\nThug stumbled, and Vin smashed her half of the staff across his eyes.\nThough dazed, he stayed on his feet. Can't fight the Thugs, she\nthought. I have to keep moving.\nShe dashed to the side, ignoring her pain. The Thugs tried to follow,\nbut she was lighter, thinner, and—much more important—faster. She circled\nthem, coming back toward the Coinshot, Smoker, and Lurcher. A wounded\nThug had again retreated to protect these men.\nAs Vin approached, the Coinshot threw a double handful of coins at\nher. Vin Pushed the coins away, then reached out and Pulled on the ones in\nthe bag at the man's waist.\nThe Coinshot grunted as the bag whipped toward Vin. It was tied by a\nshort tether to his waist, and the pull of her weight jerked him forward. The\nThug grabbed and steadied him.\nAnd since her anchor couldn't move, Vin was instead Pulled toward it.\nShe flared her iron, flying through the air, raising a fist. The Coinshot cried\nout and he pulled a tie to free the bag."

Her foot followed, crashing against the Thug's\nneck.\nNeither rose. That was three down. The discarded coin pouch fell to\nthe ground, breaking and throwing a hundred sparkling bits of copper\nacross the cobblestones around Vin. She ignored the throbbing in her elbow\nand faced down the Lurcher. He stood with his shield, looking strangely\nunworried.\nA crack sounded behind her. Vin cried out, her tin-enhanced ears\noverreacting to the sudden sound. Pain shot through her head, and she\nraised hands to her ears. She'd forgotten the Smoker, who stood holding two\nlengths of wood, crafted to make sharp noises when pounded together.\nMovements and reactions, actions and consequences—these were the\nessence of Allomancy. Tin made her eyes pierce the mists—giving her an\nedge over the assassins. However, the tin also made her ears extremely\nacute. The Smoker raised his sticks again. Vin growled and yanked a\nhandful of coins off the cobblestones, then shot them at the Smoker. The\nLurcher, of course, Pulled them toward him instead. They hit the shield and\nbounced free. And as they sprayed into the air, Vin carefully Pushed one so\nit fell behind him.\nThe man lowered his shield, unaware of the coin Vin had manipulated.\nVin Pulled, whipping the single coin directly toward her—and into the back\nof the Lurcher's chest. He fell without a sound.\nFour.\nAll fell still. The Thugs running toward her drew to a stop, and the\nSmoker lowered his sticks. They had no Coinshots and no Lurchers—\nnobody that could Push or Pull metal—and Vin stood amid a field of coins.\nIf she used them, even the Thugs would fall quickly. All she had to do was\n—\nAnother coin shot through the air, fired from the Watcher's rooftop. Vin\ncursed, ducking. The coin, however, didn't strike her. It took the stick-\nholding Smoker directly in the forehead. The man toppled backward, dead.\nWhat? Vin thought, staring at the dead man.\nThe Thugs charged, but Vin retreated, frowning. Why kill the Smoker?\nHe wasn't a threat anymore.\nUnless. . .\nVin extinguished her copper, then burned bronze, the metal that let her\nsense when other Allomancers were using powers nearby. She couldn't feel\nthe Thugs burning pewter. They were still being Smoked, their Allomancy\nhidden.\nSomeone else was burning copper.\nSuddenly, it all made sense. It made sense that the group would risk\nattacking a full Mistborn. It made sense that the Watcher had fired at the\nCoinshot. It made sense that he had killed the Smoker.\nVin was in grave danger."

It made sense that he had killed the Smoker.\nVin was in grave danger.\nShe only had a moment to make her decision. She did so on a hunch,\nbut she'd grown up on the streets, a thief and a scam artist. Hunches felt\nmore natural to her than logic ever would.\n\"OreSeur!\" she yelled. \"Go for the palace!\"\nIt was a code, of course. Vin jumped back, momentarily ignoring the\nThugs as her servant ducked out of an alleyway. He pulled something off\nhis belt and whipped it toward Vin: a small glass vial, the kind that\nAllomancers used to store metal shavings. Vin quickly Pulled the vial to her\nhand. A short distance away, the second Coinshot—who had lain there, as if\ndead—now cursed and scrambled to his feet.\nVin spun, drinking the vial with a quick gulp. It contained only a single\nbead of metal. Atium. She couldn't risk carrying it on her own body—\ncouldn't risk having it Pulled away from her during a fight. She'd ordered\nOreSeur to remain close this night, ready to give her the vial in an\nemergency.\nThe \"Coinshot\" pulled a hidden glass dagger from his waist, charging\nat Vin ahead of the Thugs, who were getting close. Vin paused for just a\nmoment—regretting her decision, but seeing its inevitability.\nThe men had hidden a Mistborn among their numbers. A Mistborn like\nVin, a person who could burn all ten metals. A Mistborn who had been\nwaiting for the right moment to strike at her, to catch her unprepared.\nHe would have atium, and there was only one way to fight someone\nwho had atium. It was the ultimate Allomantic metal, usable only by full\nMistborn, and it could easily decide the fate of a battle. Each bead was\nworth a fortune—but what good was a fortune if she died?\nVin burned her atium.\nThe world around her seemed to change. Every moving object—\nswinging shutters, blowing ash, attacking Thugs, even trails of mist—shot\nout a translucent replica of itself. The replicas moved just in front of their\nreal counterparts, showing Vin exactly what would happen a few moments\nin the future.\nOnly the Mistborn was immune. Rather than shooting out a single\natium shadow, he released dozens—the sign that he was burning atium. He\npaused just briefly. Vin's own body would have just exploded with dozens\nof confusing atium shadows. Now that she could see the future, she could\nsee what he was going to do. That, in turn, changed what she was going to\ndo. That changed what he was going to do. And so, like the reflections in\ntwo mirrors facing each other, the possibilities continued into infinity.\nNeither had an advantage.\nThough their Mistborn paused, the four unfortunate Thugs continued\nto charge, having no way to know that Vin burned atium.

Vin twisted, ducking to the side, and could\nfeel the real staff pass over her ear. The maneuver seemed easy within the\naura of atium.\nShe snatched one of the soundsticks from the air, then slammed it up\ninto the Thug's neck. She spun, catching the other soundstick, then twisted\nback and cracked it against the man's skull. He fell forward, groaning, and\nVin spun again, easily dodging between two more staves.\nShe smashed the noise sticks against the sides of a second Thug's head.\nThey shattered—ringing with a hollow sound like that of a musician's beat\n—as the Thug's skull cracked.\nHe fell, and did not move again. Vin kicked his staff into the air, then\ndropped the broken soundsticks and caught it. She spun, twisting the staff\nand tripping both remaining Thugs at once. In a fluid motion, she delivered\ntwo swift—yet powerful—blows to their faces.\nShe fell to a crouch as the men died, holding the staff in one hand, her\nother hand resting against the mist-wetted cobbles. The Mistborn held back,\nand she could see uncertainty in his eyes. Power didn't necessarily mean\ncompetence, and his two best advantages—surprise and atium—had been\nnegated.\nHe turned, Pulling a group of coins up off the ground, then shot them.\nNot toward Vin—but toward OreSeur, who still stood in the mouth of an\nalleyway. The Mistborn obviously hoped that Vin's concern for her servant\nwould draw her attention away, perhaps letting him escape.\nHe was wrong.\nVin ignored the coins, dashing forward. Even as OreSeur cried out in\npain—a dozen coins piercing his skin—Vin threw her staff at the Mistborn's\nhead. Once it left her fingers, however, its atium shadow became firm and\nsingular.\nThe Mistborn assassin ducked, dodging perfectly. The move distracted\nhim long enough for her to close the distance, however. She needed to\nattack quickly; the atium bead she'd swallowed had been small. It would\nburn out quickly. And, once it was gone, she'd be exposed. Her opponent\nwould have total power over her. He—\nHer terrified opponent raised his dagger. At that moment, his atium ran\nout.\nVin's predatory instincts reacted instantly, and she swung a fist. He\nraised an arm to block her blow, but she saw it coming, and she changed the\ndirection of her attack. The blow took him square in the face. Then, with\ndeft fingers, she snatched his glass dagger before it could fall and shatter.\nShe stood and swung it through her opponent's neck.\nHe fell quietly.\nVin stood, breathing heavily, the group of assassins dead around her.\nFor just a moment, she felt overwhelming power. With atium, she was\ninvincible. She could dodge any blow, kill any enemy.\nHer atium ran out.\nSuddenly, everything seemed to grow dull. The pain in her side\nreturned to her mind, and she coughed, groaning. She'd have bruises—large\nones. Perhaps some cracked ribs.\nBut she'd won again. Barely. What would happen when she failed?"

What would happen when she failed?\nWhen she didn't watch carefully enough, or fight skillfully enough?\nElend would die.\nVin sighed, and looked up. He was still there, watching her from atop a\nroof. Despite a half-dozen chases spread across several months, she'd never\nmanaged to catch him. Someday she would corner him in the night.\nBut not today. She didn't have the energy. In fact, a part of her worried\nthat he'd strike her down. But. . .she thought. He saved me. I would have\ndied if I'd gotten too close to that hidden Mistborn. An instant of him\nburning atium with me unaware, and I'd have found his daggers in my\nchest.\nThe Watcher stood for a few more moments—wreathed, as always, in\nthe curling mists. Then he turned, jumping away into the night. Vin let him\ngo; she had to deal with OreSeur.\nShe stumbled over to him, then paused. His nondescript body—in a\nservant's trousers and shirt—had been pelted with coins, and blood seeped\nfrom the several wounds.\nHe looked up at her. \"What?\" he asked.\n\"I didn't expect there to be blood.\"\nOreSeur snorted. \"You probably didn't expect me to feel pain either.\"\nVin opened her mouth, then paused. Actually, she hadn't ever thought\nabout it. Then she hardened herself. What right does this thing have to\nchastise me?\nStill, OreSeur had proven useful. \"Thank you for throwing me the\nvial,\" she said.\n\"It was my duty, Mistress,\" OreSeur said, grunting as he pulled his\nbroken body up against the side of the alleyway. \"I was charged with your\nprotection by Master Kelsier. As always, I serve the Contract.\"\nAh, yes. The almighty Contract. \"Can you walk?\"\n\"Only with effort, Mistress. The coins shattered several of these bones.\nI will need a new body. One of the assassins, perhaps?\"\nVin frowned. She glanced back toward the dead men, and her stomach\ntwisted slightly at the gruesome sight of their fallen bodies. She'd killed\nthem, eight men, with the cruel efficiency that Kelsier had trained in her.\nThis is what I am, she thought. A killer, like those men. That was how it\nhad to be. Someone had to protect Elend.\nHowever, the thought of OreSeur eating one of them—digesting the\ncorpse, letting his strange kandra senses memorize the positioning of\nmuscles, skin, and organs, so that he could reproduce them—sickened her.\nShe glanced to the side, and saw the veiled scorn in OreSeur's eyes.\nThey both knew what she thought of him eating human bodies. They both\nknew what he thought of her prejudice.\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"We won't use one of these men.\"\n\"You'll have to find me another body, then,\" OreSeur said. \"The\nContract states that I cannot be forced to kill men.\"\nVin's stomach twisted again.

I'll think of something, she thought. His\ncurrent body was that of a murderer, taken after an execution. Vin was still\nworried that someone in the city would recognize the face.\n\"Can you get back to the palace?\" Vin asked.\n\"With time,\" OreSeur said.\nVin nodded, dismissing him, then turned back toward the bodies.\nSomehow she suspected that this night would mark a distinct turning point\nin the fate of the Central Dominance.\nStraff's assassins had done more damage than they would ever know.\nThat bead of atium had been her last. The next time a Mistborn attacked\nher, she would be exposed.\nAnd would likely die as easily as the Mistborn she'd slain this night.\nMy brethren ignore the other facts. They cannot connect the other\nstrange things that are happening. They are deaf to my objections and blind\nto my discoveries.\n3\nELEND DROPPED HIS PEN TO his desk with a sigh, then leaned\nback in his chair and rubbed his forehead.\nElend figured that he knew as much about political theory as any living\nman. He'd certainly read more about economics, studied more about\ngovernments, and held more political debates than anyone he knew. He\nunderstood all the theories about how to make a nation stable and fair, and\nhad tried to implement those in his new kingdom.\nHe just hadn't realized how incredibly frustrating a parliamentary\ncouncil would be.\nHe stood up and walked over to get himself some chilled wine. He\npaused, however, as he glanced out his balcony doors. In the distance, a\nglowing haze shone through the mists. The campfires of his father's army.\nHe put down the wine. He was already exhausted, and the alcohol\nprobably wouldn't help. I can't afford to fall asleep until I get this done! he\nthought, forcing himself to return to his seat. The Assembly would meet\nsoon, and he needed to have the proposal finished tonight.\nElend picked up the sheet, scanning its contents. His handwriting\nlooked cramped even to him, and the page was scattered with crossed-out\nlines and notations—reflections of his frustration. They'd known about the\narmy's approach for weeks now, and the Assembly still quibbled about what\nto do.\nSome of its members wanted to offer a peace treaty; others thought\nthey should simply surrender the city. Still others felt they should attack\nwithout delay. Elend feared that the surrender faction was gaining strength;\nhence his proposal. The motion, if passed, would buy him more time. As\nking, he already had prime right of parlay with a foreign dictator. The\nproposal would forbid the Assembly from doing anything rash until he'd at\nleast met with his father.\nElend sighed again, dropping the sheet. The Assembly was only\ntwenty-four men, but getting them to agree on anything was almost more\nchallenging than any of the problems they argued about. Elend turned,\nlooking past the solitary lamp on his desk, out through the open balcony\ndoors and toward the fires.

Overhead, he heard feet scuttling on the rooftop\n—Vin, going about her nightly rounds.\nElend smiled fondly, but not even thinking of Vin could restore his\ngood temper. That group of assassins she fought tonight. Can I use that\nsomehow? Perhaps if he made the attack public, the Assembly would be\nreminded of the disdain Straff had for human life, and then be less likely to\nsurrender the city to him. But. . .perhaps they'd also get frightened that he'd\nsend assassins after them, and be more likely to surrender.\nSometimes Elend wondered if the Lord Ruler had been right. Not in\noppressing the people, of course—but in retaining all of the power for\nhimself. The Final Empire had been nothing if not stable. It had lasted a\nthousand years, weathering rebellions, maintaining a strong hold on the\nworld.\nThe Lord Ruler was immortal, though, Elend thought. That's an\nadvantage I'll certainly never have.\nThe Assembly was a better way. By giving the people a parliament\nwith real legal authority, Elend would craft a stable government. The people\nwould have a king—a man to provide continuity, a symbol of unity. A man\nwho wouldn't be tainted by the need to get reappointed. However, they\nwould also have an Assembly—a council made up of their peers that could\nvoice their concerns.\nIt all sounded wonderful in theory. Assuming they survived the next\nfew months.\nElend rubbed his eyes, then dipped his pen and began to scratch new\nsentences at the bottom of the document.\nThe Lord Ruler was dead.\nEven a year later, Vin sometimes found that concept difficult to grasp.\nThe Lord Ruler had been. . .everything. King and god, lawmaker and\nultimate authority. He had been eternal and absolute, and now he was dead.\nVin had killed him.\nOf course, the truth wasn't as impressive as the stories. It hadn't been\nheroic strength or mystical power that had let Vin defeat the emperor. She'd\njust figured out the trick that he'd been using to make himself immortal, and\nshe'd fortunately—almost accidentally—exploited his weakness. She wasn't\nbrave or clever. Just lucky.\nVin sighed. Her bruises still throbbed, but she had suffered far worse.\nShe sat atop the palace—once Keep Venture—just above Elend's balcony.\nHer reputation might have been unearned, but it had helped keep Elend\nalive. Though dozens of warlords squabbled in the land that had once been\nthe Final Empire, none of them had marched on Luthadel.\nUntil now.\nFires burned outside the city. Straff would soon know that his assassins\nhad failed. What then? Assault the city? Ham and Clubs warned that\nLuthadel couldn't hold against a determined attack. Straff had to know that.\nStill, for the moment, Elend was safe. Vin had gotten pretty good at\nfinding and killing assassins; barely a month passed that she didn't catch\nsomeone trying to sneak into the palace. Many were just spies, and very few\nwere Allomancers. However, a normal man's steel knife would kill Elend\njust as easily as an Allomancer's glass one.\nShe wouldn't let that occur. Whatever else happened—whatever\nsacrifices it required—Elend had to stay alive."

Whatever else happened—whatever\nsacrifices it required—Elend had to stay alive.\nSuddenly apprehensive, she slipped over to the skylight to check on\nhim. Elend sat safely at his desk below, scribbling away on some new\nproposal or edict. Kingship had changed the man remarkably little. About\nfour years her senior—placing him in his early twenties—Elend was a man\nwho put great stock in learning, but little in appearance. He only bothered to\ncomb his hair when he attended an important function, and he somehow\nmanaged to wear even well-tailored outfits with an air of dishevelment.\nHe was probably the best man she had ever known. Earnest,\ndetermined, clever, and caring. And, for some reason, he loved her. At\ntimes, that fact was even more amazing to her than her part in the Lord\nRuler's death.\nVin looked up, glancing back at the army lights. Then she looked to\nthe sides. The Watcher had not returned. Often on nights like this he would\ntempt her, coming dangerously close to Elend's room before disappearing\ninto the city.\nOf course, if he'd wanted to kill Elend, he could just have done it while\nI was fighting the others. . ..\nIt was a disquieting thought. Vin couldn't watch Elend every moment.\nHe was exposed a frightening amount of the time.\nTrue, Elend had other bodyguards, and some were even Allomancers.\nThey, however, were stretched as thin as she was. This night's assassins had\nbeen the most skilled, and most dangerous, that she had ever faced. She\nshivered, thinking about the Mistborn who had hid among them. He hadn't\nbeen very good, but he wouldn't have needed much skill to burn atium, then\nstrike Vin directly in the right place.\nThe shifting mists continued to spin. The army's presence whispered a\ndisturbing truth: The surrounding warlords were beginning to consolidate\ntheir domains, and were thinking about expansion. Even if Luthadel stood\nagainst Straff somehow, others would come.\nQuietly, Vin closed her eyes and burned bronze, still worried that the\nWatcher—or some other Allomancer—might be nearby, planning to attack\nElend in the supposedly safe aftermath of the assassination attempt. Most\nMistborn considered bronze to be a relatively useless metal, as it was easily\nnegated. With copper, a Mistborn could mask their Allomancy—not to\nmention protect themselves from emotional manipulation by zinc or brass.\nMost Mistborn considered it foolish not to have their copper on at all times.\nAnd yet. . .Vin had the ability to pierce copperclouds.\nA coppercloud wasn't a visible thing. It was far more vague. A pocket\nof deadened air where Allomancers could burn their metals and not worry\nthat bronze burners would be able to sense them. But Vin could sense\nAllomancers who used metals inside of a coppercloud. She still wasn't\ncertain why. Even Kelsier, the most powerful Allomancer she had known,\nhadn't been able to pierce a coppercloud.\nTonight, however, she sensed nothing.\nWith a sigh, she opened her eyes.

Marsh had confirmed that Steel Inquisitors could\npierce copperclouds, and she was certain that the Lord Ruler had been able\nto do so. But. . .why her? Why could Vin—a girl who barely had two years'\ntraining as a Mistborn—do it?\nThere was more. She still remembered vividly the morning when she'd\nfought the Lord Ruler. There was something about that event that she hadn't\ntold anyone—partially because it made her fear, just a bit, that the rumors\nand legends about her were true. Somehow, she'd drawn upon the mists,\nusing them to fuel her Allomancy instead of metals.\nIt was only with that power, the power of the mists, that she had been\nable to beat the Lord Ruler in the end. She liked to tell herself that she had\nsimply been lucky in figuring out the Lord Ruler's tricks. But. . .there had\nbeen something strange that night, something that she'd done. Something\nthat she shouldn't have been able to do, and had never been able to repeat.\nVin shook her head. There was so much they didn't know, and not just\nabout Allomancy. She and the other leaders of Elend's fledgling kingdom\ntried their best, but without Kelsier to guide them, Vin felt blind. Plans,\nsuccesses, and even goals were like shadowy figures in the mist, formless\nand indistinct.\nYou shouldn't have left us, Kell, she thought. You saved the world—but\nyou should have been able to do it without dying. Kelsier, the Survivor of\nHathsin, the man who had conceived and implemented the collapse of the\nFinal Empire. Vin had known him, worked with him, been trained by him.\nHe was a legend and a hero. Yet, he had also been a man. Fallible.\nImperfect. It was easy for the skaa to revere him, then blame Elend and the\nothers for the dire situation that Kelsier had created.\nThe thought left her feeling bitter. Thinking about Kelsier often did\nthat. Perhaps it was the sense of abandonment, or perhaps it was just the\nuncomfortable knowledge that Kelsier—like Vin herself—didn't fully live\nup to his reputation.\nVin sighed, closing her eyes, still burning bronze. The evening's fight\nhad taken a lot out of her, and she was beginning to dread the hours she still\nintended to spend watching. It would be difficult to remain alert when—\nShe sensed something.\nVin snapped her eyes open, flaring her tin. She spun and stooped\nagainst the rooftop to obscure her profile. There was someone out there,\nburning metal. Bronze pulses thumped weakly, faint, almost unnoticeable—\nlike someone playing drums very quietly. They were muffled by a\ncoppercloud. The person—whoever it was—thought that their copper\nwould hide them.\nSo far, Vin hadn't left anyone alive, save Elend and Marsh, who knew\nof her strange power.\nVin crept forward, fingers and toes chilled by the roof's copper\nsheeting.

The pulses seemed indistinct, like ripples in a thick mud.\nThey were coming from somewhere very close. . .. On the rooftop. . .\nJust in front of her.\nVin froze, crouching, the night breezes blowing a wall of mist across\nher. Where was he? Her senses argued with each other; her bronze said\nthere was something right in front of her, but her eyes refused to agree.\nShe studied the dark mists, glanced upward just to be certain, then\nstood. This is the first time my bronze has been wrong, she thought with a\nfrown.\nThen she saw it.\nNot something in the mists, but something of the mists. The figure\nstood a few feet away, easy to miss, for its shape was only faintly outlined\nby the mist. Vin gasped, stepping backward.\nThe figure continued to stand where it was. She couldn't tell much\nabout it; its features were cloudy and vague, outlined by the chaotic\nchurnings of windblown mist. If not for the form's persistence, she could\nhave dismissed it—like the shape of an animal seen briefly in the clouds.\nBut it stayed.

The bits of metal zipped through the mist, trailing streaks,\nand passed right through the shadowy figure.\nIt stood for a moment. Then, it simply puffed away, dissipating into the\nmists' random curls.\nElend wrote the final line with a flair, though he knew he'd simply have\na scribe rewrite the proposal. Still, he was proud. He thought that he'd been\nable to work out an argument that would finally convince the Assembly that\nthey could not simply surrender to Straff.\nHe glanced unconsciously toward a stack of papers on his desk. On\ntheir top sat an innocent-seeming yellow letter, still folded, bloodlike\nsmudge of wax broken at the seal. The letter had been short. Elend\nremembered its words easily.\nSon,\nI trust you've enjoyed seeing after Venture interests in Luthadel.

You may turn over control of the city to me at that time.\nKing Straff Venture\nOf all the warlords and despots that had afflicted the Final Empire\nsince the Lord Ruler's death, Straff was the most dangerous.

The\nother times, she held herself back—but Elend often caught her glancing\ndistrustfully toward potential hiding places.\nShe was far less jumpy when she didn't have a particular reason to\nworry about him. However, Elend was only just beginning to understand\nthat there was a very complex person hiding behind the face he had once\nknown as Valette Renoux's. He had fallen in love with her courtly side\nwithout ever knowing the nervous, furtive Mistborn side. It was still a little\ndifficult to see them as the same person.\nVin closed the door, then paused briefly, watching him with her round,\ndark eyes. Elend found himself smiling. Despite her oddities—or, more\nlikely because of them—he loved this thin woman with the determined eyes\nand blunt temperament. She was like no one he had ever known—a woman\nof simple, yet honest, beauty and wit.\nShe did, however, sometimes worry him.\n\"Vin?\" he asked, standing.\n\"Have you seen anything strange tonight?\"\nElend paused. \"Besides you?\"\nShe frowned, striding across the room. Elend watched her small form,\nclothed in black trousers and a man's buttoning shirt, mistcloak tassels\ntrailing behind her. She wore the cloak's hood down, as usual, and she\nstepped with a supple grace—the unconscious elegance of a person burning\npewter.\nFocus! he told himself. You really are getting tired. \"Vin? What's\nwrong?\"\nVin glanced toward the balcony. \"That Mistborn, the Watcher, is in the\ncity again.\"\n\"You're sure?\"\nVin nodded. \"But. . .I don't think he's going to come for you tonight.\"\nElend frowned.

The balcony doors were still open, and trails of mist\npuffed through them, creeping along the floor until they finally evaporated.\nBeyond those doors was. . .darkness. Chaos.\nIt's just mist, he told himself. Water vapor. Nothing to fear. \"What\nmakes you think the Mistborn won't come for me?\"\nVin shrugged. \"I just feel he won't.\"\nShe often answered that way. Vin had grown up a creature of the\nstreets, and she trusted her instincts. Oddly, so did Elend. He eyed her,\nreading the uncertainty in her posture. Something else had unsettled her this\nnight. He looked into her eyes, holding them for a moment, until she\nglanced away.\n\"What?\" he asked.\n\"I saw. . .something else,\" she said. \"Or, I thought I did. Something in\nthe mist, like a person formed from smoke. I could feel it, too, with\nAllomancy. It disappeared, though.\"\nElend frowned more deeply. He walked forward, putting his arms\naround her. \"Vin, you're pushing yourself too hard. You can't keep prowling\nthe city at night and then staying up all day. Even Allomancers need rest.\"\nShe nodded quietly. In his arms, she didn't seem to him like the\npowerful warrior who had slain the Lord Ruler. She felt like a woman past\nthe edge of fatigue, a woman overwhelmed by events—a woman who\nprobably felt a lot like Elend did.\nShe let him hold her. At first, there was a slight stiffness to her posture.\nIt was as if a piece of her still expected to be hurt—a primal sliver that\ncouldn't understand that it was possible to be touched out of love rather than\nanger. Then, however, she relaxed. Elend was one of the few she could do\nthat around. When she held him—really held him—she clung with a\ndesperation that bordered on terror. Somehow, despite her powerful skill as\nan Allomancer and her stubborn determination, Vin was frighteningly\nvulnerable. She seemed to need Elend. For that, he felt lucky.\nFrustrated, at times. But lucky. Vin and he hadn't discussed his\nmarriage proposal and her refusal, though Elend often thought of the\nencounter.\nWomen are difficult enough to understand, he thought, and I had to go\nand pick the oddest one of the lot. Still, he couldn't really complain. She\nloved him. He could deal with her idiosyncrasies.\nVin sighed, then looked up at him, finally relaxing as he leaned down\nto kiss her. He held it for a long moment, and she sighed. After the kiss, she\nrested her head on his shoulder. \"We do have another problem,\" she said\nquietly. \"I used the last of the atium tonight.\"\n\"Fighting the assassins?\"\nVin nodded.\n\"Well, we knew it would happen eventually. Our stockpile couldn't last\nforever.\"\n\"Stockpile?\" Vin asked. \"Kelsier only left us six beads.\"\nElend sighed, then pulled her tight.

        "text": "\"Stockpile?\" Vin asked. \"Kelsier only left us six beads.\"\nElend sighed, then pulled her tight. His new government was supposed\nto have inherited the Lord Ruler's atium reserves—a supposed cache of the\nmetal comprising an amazing treasure. Kelsier had counted on his new\nkingdom holding those riches; he had died expecting it. There was only one\nproblem. Nobody had ever found the reserve. They had found some small\nbit—the atium that had made up the bracers that the Lord Ruler had used as\na Feruchemical battery to store up age. However, they had spent those on\nsupplies for the city, and they had actually contained only a very small bit\nof atium. Nothing like the cache was said to have. There should still be,\nsomewhere in the city, a wealth of atium thousands of times larger than\nthose bracers.\n\"We'll just have to deal with it,\" Elend said.\n\"If a Mistborn attacks you, I won't be able to kill him.\"\n\"Only if he has atium,\" Elend said. \"It's becoming more and more rare.\nI doubt the other kings have much of it.\"\nKelsier had destroyed the Pits of Hathsin, the only place where atium\ncould be mined. Still, if Vin did have to fight someone with atium. . .\nDon't think about that, he told himself. Just keep searching. Perhaps\nwe can buy some. Or maybe we'll find the Lord Ruler's cache. If it even\nexists. . ..\nVin looked up at him, reading the concern in his eyes, and he knew she\nhad arrived at the same conclusions as he. There was little that could be\naccomplished at the moment; Vin had done well to conserve their atium as\nlong as she had. Still, as Vin stepped back and let Elend return to his table,\nhe couldn't help thinking about how they could have spent that atium. His\npeople would need food for the winter.\nBut, by selling the metal, he thought, sitting, we would have put more\nof the world's most dangerous Allomantic weapon into the hands of our\nenemies. Better that Vin used it up.\nAs he began to work again, Vin poked her head over his shoulder,\nobscuring his lamplight. \"What is it?\" she asked.\n\"The proposal blocking the Assembly until I've had my right of\nparlay.\"\n\"Again?\" she asked, cocking her head and squinting as she tried to\nmake out his handwriting.\n\"The Assembly rejected the last version.\"\nVin frowned. \"Why don't you just tell them that they have to accept it?\nYou're the king.\"\n\"Now, see,\" Elend said, \"that's what I'm trying to prove by all this. I'm\njust one man, Vin—maybe my opinion isn't better than theirs. If we all work\non the proposal together, it will come out better than if one man had done it\nhimself.\"\nVin shook her head. \"It will be too weak. No teeth. You should trust\nyourself more.\"\n\"It's not about trust. It's about what's right. We spent a thousand years\nfighting off the Lord Ruler—if I do things the same way he did, then what\nwill be the difference?\"\nVin turned and looked him in the eyes. \"The Lord Ruler was an evil"

You're a good one.

Now, kindly\nremove yourself from my light so I can get back to work.\"\nShe snorted, but stood up and rounded the desk, leaving behind a faint\nscent of perfume. Elend frowned. When'd she put that on? Many of her\nmotions were so quick that he missed them.\nPerfume—just another of the apparent contradictions that made up the\nwoman who called herself Vin. She wouldn't have been wearing it out in the\nmists; she usually put it on just for him. Vin liked to be unobtrusive, but she\nloved wearing scents—and got annoyed at him if he didn't notice when she\nwas trying out a new one. She seemed suspicious and paranoid, yet she\ntrusted her friends with a dogmatic loyalty. She went out at night in black\nand gray, trying so hard to hide—but Elend had seen her at the balls a year\nago, and she had looked natural in gowns and dresses.\nFor some reason she had stopped wearing those. She hadn't ever\nexplained why.\nElend shook his head, turning back to his proposal. Next to Vin,\npolitics seemed simplistic. She rested her arms on the desktop, watching\nhim work, yawning.\n\"You should get some rest,\" he said, dipping his pen again.\nVin paused, then nodded. She removed her mistcloak, wrapped it\naround herself, then curled up on the rug beside his desk.\nElend paused. \"I didn't mean here, Vin,\" he said with amusement.\n\"There's still a Mistborn out there somewhere,\" she said with a tired,\nmuffled voice. \"I'm not leaving you.\" She twisted in the cloak, and Elend\ncaught a brief grimace of pain on her face. She was favoring her left side.\nShe didn't often tell him the details of her fights. She didn't want to\nworry him. It didn't help.\nElend pushed down his concern and forced himself to start reading\nagain. He was almost finished—just a bit more and—\nA knock came at his door.\nElend turned with frustration, wondering at this new interruption. Ham\npoked his head in the doorway a second later.\n\"Ham?\" Elend said. \"You're still awake?\"\n\"Unfortunately,\" Ham said, stepping into the room.\n\"Mardra is going to kill you for working late again,\" Elend said, setting\ndown his pen. Complain though he might about some of Vin's quirks, at\nleast she shared Elend's nocturnal habits.\nHam just rolled his eyes at the comment. He still wore his standard\nvest and trousers. He'd agreed to be the captain of Elend's guard on a single\ncondition: that he would never have to wear a uniform. Vin cracked an eye\nas Ham wandered into the room, then relaxed again.\n\"Regardless,\" Elend said. \"To what do I owe the visit?\""

Vin cracked an eye\nas Ham wandered into the room, then relaxed again.\n\"Regardless,\" Elend said. \"To what do I owe the visit?\"\n\"I thought you might want to know that we identified those assassins\nwho tried to kill Vin.\"\nElend nodded. \"Probably men I know.\" Most Allomancers were\nnoblemen, and he was familiar with all of those in Straff's retinue.\n\"Actually, I doubt it,\" Ham said. \"They were Westerners.\"\nElend paused, frowning, and Vin perked up. \"You're sure?\"\nHam nodded. \"Makes it a bit unlikely that your father sent them—\nunless he's done some heavy recruiting in Fadrex City. They were of\nHouses Gardre and Conrad, mostly.\"\nElend sat back. His father was based in Urteau, hereditary home of the\nVenture family. Fadrex was halfway across the empire from Urteau, several\nmonths' worth of travel. The chances were slim that his father would have\naccess to a group of Western Allomancers.\n\"Have you heard of Ashweather Cett?\" Ham asked.\nElend nodded. \"One of the men who's set himself up as king in the\nWestern Dominance. I don't know much about him.\"\nVin frowned, sitting. \"You think he sent these?\"\nHam nodded. \"They must have been waiting for a chance to slip into\nthe city, and the traffic at the gates these last few days would have provided\nthe opportunity. That makes the arrival of Straff's army and the attack on\nVin's life something of a coincidence.\"\nElend glanced at Vin. She met his eyes, and he could tell that she\nwasn't completely convinced that Straff hadn't sent the assassins. Elend,\nhowever, wasn't so skeptical. Pretty much every tyrant in the area had tried\nto take him out at one point or another. Why not Cett?\nIt's that atium, Elend thought with frustration. He'd never found the\nLord Ruler's cache—but that didn't stop the despots in the empire from\nassuming he was hiding it somewhere.\n\"Well, at least your father didn't send the assassins,\" Ham said, ever\nthe optimist.\nElend shook his head. \"Our relationship wouldn't stop him, Ham. Trust\nme.\"\n\"He's your father,\" Ham said, looking troubled.\n\"Things like that don't matter to Straff. He probably hasn't sent\nassassins because he doesn't think I'm worth the trouble. If we last long\nenough, though, he will.\"\nHam shook his head. \"I've heard of sons killing their fathers to take\ntheir place. . .but fathers killing their sons. . .I wonder what that says about\nold Straff's mind, that he'd be willing to kill you. You think that—\"\n\"Ham?\" Elend interrupted.\n\"Hum?\"\n\"You know I'm usually good for a discussion, but I don't really have\ntime for philosophy right now.\"\n\"Oh, right.\" Ham smiled wanly, standing and moving to go. \"I should\nget back to Mardra anyway.\"\nElend nodded, rubbing his forehead and picking up his pen yet again.\n\"Make sure you gather the crew for a meeting.

We need to organize our\nallies, Ham. If we don't come up with something incredibly clever, this\nkingdom may be doomed.\"\nHam turned back, still smiling. \"You make it sound so desperate, El.\"\nElend looked over at him. \"The Assembly is a mess, a half-dozen\nwarlords with superior armies are breathing down my neck, barely a month\npasses without someone sending assassins to kill me, and the woman I love\nis slowly driving me insane.\"\nVin snorted at this last part.\n\"Oh, is that all?\" Ham said. \"See? It's not so bad after all. I mean, we\ncould be facing an immortal god and his all-powerful priests instead.\"\nElend paused, then chuckled despite himself. \"Good night, Ham,\" he\nsaid, turning back to his proposal.\n\"Good night, Your Majesty.\"\nPerhaps they are right. Perhaps I am mad, or jealous, or simply daft.\nMy name is Kwaan. Philosopher, scholar, traitor. I am the one who\ndiscovered Alendi, and I am the one who first proclaimed him to be the\nHero of Ages. I am the one who started this all.\n4\nTHE BODY SHOWED NO OVERT wounds. It still lay where it had\nfallen—the other villagers had been afraid to move it. Its arms and legs\nwere twisted in awkward positions, the dirt around it scuffed from predeath\nthrashings.\nSazed reached out, running his fingers along one of the marks. Though\nthe soil here in the Eastern Dominance held far more clay than soil did in\nthe north, it was still more black than it was brown. Ashfalls came even this\nfar south. Ashless soil, washed clean and fertilized, was a luxury used only\nfor the ornamental plants of noble gardens. The rest of the world had to do\nwhat it could with untreated soil.\n\"You say that he was alone when he died?\" Sazed asked, turning to the\nsmall cluster of villagers standing behind him.\nA leather-skinned man nodded. \"Like I said, Master Terrisman. He was\njust standing there, no one else about. He paused, then he fell and wiggled\non the ground for a bit. After that, he just. . .stopped moving.\"\nSazed turned back to the corpse, studying the twisted muscles, the face\nlocked in a mask of pain. Sazed had brought his medical coppermind—the\nmetal armband wrapped around his upper right arm—and he reached into it\nwith his mind, pulling out some of the memorized books he had stored\ntherein. Yes, there were some diseases that killed with shakes and spasms.\nThey rarely took a man so suddenly, but it sometimes happened. If it hadn't\nbeen for other circumstances, Sazed would have paid the death little heed.\n\"Please, repeat to me again what you saw,\" Sazed asked.\nThe leather-skinned man at the front of the group, Teur, paled slightly.\nHe was in an odd position—his natural desire for notoriety would make him\nwant to gossip about his experience. However, doing so could earn the\ndistrust of his superstitious fellows."

However, doing so could earn the\ndistrust of his superstitious fellows.\n\"I was just passing by, Master Terrisman,\" Teur said. \"On the path\ntwenty yards yon. I seen old Jed working his field—a hard worker, he was.\nSome of us took a break when the lords left, but old Jed just kept on. Guess\nhe knew we'd be needing food for the winter, lords or no lords.\"\nTeur paused, then glanced to the side. \"I know what people say, Master\nTerrisman, but I seen what I seen. It was day when I passed, but there was\nmist in the valley here. It stopped me, because I've never been out in the\nmist—my wife'll vouch me that. I was going to turn back, and then I seen\nold Jed. He was just working away, as if he hadn't seen the mist.\n\"I was going to call out to him, but before I could, he just. . .well, like I\ntold you. I seen him standing there, then he froze. The mist swirled about\nhim a bit, then he began to jerk and twist, like something really strong was\nholding him and shaking him. He fell. Didn't get up after that.\"\nStill kneeling, Sazed looked back at the corpse. Teur apparently had a\nreputation for tall tales. Yet, the body was a chilling corroboration—not to\nmention Sazed's own experience several weeks before.\nMist during the day.\nSazed stood, turning toward the villagers. \"Please fetch for me a\nshovel.\"\nNobody helped him dig the grave. It was slow, muggy work in the\nsouthern heat, which was strong despite the advent of autumn. The clay\nearth was difficult to move—but, fortunately, Sazed had a bit of extra\nstored-up strength inside a pewtermind, and he tapped it for help.\nHe needed it, for he wasn't what one would call an athletic man. Tall\nand long-limbed, he had the build of a scholar, and still wore the colorful\nrobes of a Terris steward. He also still kept his head shaved, after the\nmanner of the station he had served in for the first forty-some years of his\nlife. He didn't wear much of his jewelry now—he didn't want to tempt\nhighway bandits—but his earlobes were stretched out and pierced with\nnumerous holes for earrings.\nTapping strength from his pewtermind enlarged his muscles slightly,\ngiving him the build of a stronger man. Even with the extra strength,\nhowever, his steward's robes were stained with sweat and dirt by the time he\nfinished digging. He rolled the body into the grave, and stood quietly for a\nmoment. The man had been a dedicated farmer.\nSazed searched through his religions coppermind for an appropriate\ntheology. He started with an index—one of the many that he had created.\nWhen he had located an appropriate religion, he pulled free detailed\nmemories about its practices. The writings entered his mind as fresh as\nwhen he had just finished memorizing them.

It was the way of the Keeper, the\nmethod by which his people retained enormous wealths of information.\nThis day, the memories he selected were of HaDah, a southern religion\nwith an agricultural deity. Like most religions—which had been oppressed\nduring the time of the Lord Ruler—the HaDah faith was a thousand years\nextinct.\nFollowing the dictates of the HaDah funeral ceremony, Sazed walked\nover to a nearby tree—or, at least, one of the shrublike plants that passed for\ntrees in this area. He broke off a long branch—the peasants watching him\ncuriously—and carried it back to the grave. He stooped down and drove it\ninto the dirt at the bottom of the hole, just beside the corpse's head. Then he\nstood and began to shovel dirt back into the grave.\nThe peasants watched him with dull eyes. So depressed, Sazed\nthought. The Eastern Dominance was the most chaotic and unsettled of the\nfive Inner Dominances. The only men in this crowd were well past their\nprime. The press gangs had done their work efficiently; the husbands and\nfathers of this village were likely dead on some battlefield that no longer\nmattered.\nIt was hard to believe that anything could actually be worse than the\nLord Ruler's oppression. Sazed told himself that these people's pain would\npass, that they would someday know prosperity because of what he and the\nothers had done. Yet, he had seen farmers forced to slaughter each other,\nhad seen children starve because some despot had \"requisitioned\" a village's\nentire food supply. He had seen thieves kill freely because the Lord Ruler's\ntroops no longer patrolled the canals. He had seen chaos, death, hatred, and\ndisorder. And he couldn't help but acknowledge that he was partially to\nblame.\nHe continued to refill the hole. He had been trained as a scholar and a\ndomestic attendant; he was a Terrisman steward, the most useful, most\nexpensive, and most prestigious of servants in the Final Empire. That meant\nalmost nothing now. He'd never dug a grave, but he did his best, trying to be\nreverent as he piled dirt on the corpse. Surprisingly, about halfway through\nthe process, the peasants began to help him, pushing dirt from the pile into\nthe hole.\nPerhaps there is hope for these yet, Sazed thought, thankfully letting\none of the others take his shovel and finish the work. When they were done,\nthe very tip of the HaDah branch breached the dirt at the head of the grave.\n\"Why'd you do that?\" Teur asked, nodding to the branch.\nSazed smiled. \"It is a religious ceremony, Goodman Teur. If you\nplease, there is a prayer that should accompany it.\"\n\"A prayer? Something from the Steel Ministry?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"No, my friend. It is a prayer from a previous\ntime, a time before the Lord Ruler.\"\nThe peasants eyed each other, frowning. Teur just rubbed his wrinkled\nchin.

Some of your ancestors might have followed it, I think.\nIf any of you wish, I can teach you of its precepts.\"\nThe assembled crowd stood quietly. There weren't many of them—two\ndozen or so, mostly middle-aged women and a few older men. There was a\nsingle young man with a club leg; Sazed was surprised that he'd lived so\nlong on a plantation. Most lords killed invalids to keep them from draining\nresources.\n\"When is the Lord Ruler coming back?\" asked a woman.\n\"I do not believe that he will,\" Sazed said.\n\"Why did he abandon us?\"\n\"It is a time of change,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps it is also time to learn of\nother truths, other ways.\"\nThe group of people shuffled quietly. Sazed sighed quietly; these\npeople associated faith with the Steel Ministry and its obligators. Religion\nwasn't something that skaa worried about—save, perhaps, to avoid it when\npossible.\nThe Keepers spent a thousand years gathering and memorizing the\ndying religions of the world, Sazed thought. Who would have thought that\nnow—with the Lord Ruler gone—people wouldn't care enough to want what\nthey'd lost?\nYet, he found it hard to think ill of these people. They were struggling\nto survive, their already harsh world suddenly made unpredictable. They\nwere tired. Was it any wonder that talk of beliefs long forgotten failed to\ninterest them?\n\"Come,\" Sazed said, turning toward the village. \"There are other things\n—more practical things—that I can teach you.\"\nAnd I am the one who betrayed Alendi, for I now know that he must\nnever be allowed to complete his quest.\n5\nVIN COULD SEE SIGNS OF anxiety reflected in the city. Workers\nmilled anxiously and markets bustled with an edge of concern—showing\nthat same apprehension that one might see in a cornered rodent. Frightened,\nbut not sure what to do. Doomed with nowhere to run.\nMany had left the city during the last year—noblemen fleeing,\nmerchants seeking some other place of business. Yet, at the same time, the\ncity had swelled with an influx of skaa. They had somehow heard of Elend's\nproclamation of freedom, and had come with optimism—or, at least, as\nmuch optimism as an overworked, underfed, repeatedly beaten populace\ncould manage.\nAnd so, despite predictions that Luthadel would soon fall, despite\nwhispers that its army was small and weak, the people had stayed. Worked.\nLived. Just as they always had. The life of a skaa had never been very\ncertain.\nIt was still strange for Vin to see the market so busy. She walked down\nKenton Street, wearing her customary trousers and buttoned shirt, thinking\nabout the time when she'd visited the street during the days before the\nCollapse. It had been the quiet home of some exclusive tailoring shops.\nWhen Elend had abolished the restrictions on skaa merchants, Kenton\nStreet had changed.

        "text": "When Elend had abolished the restrictions on skaa merchants, Kenton\nStreet had changed. The thoroughfare had blossomed into a wild bazaar of\nshops, pushcarts, and tents. In order to target the newly empowered—and\nnewly waged—skaa workers, the shop owners had altered their selling\nmethods. Where once they had coaxed with rich window displays, they now\ncalled and demanded, using criers, salesmen, and even jugglers to try to\nattract trade.\nThe street was so busy that Vin usually avoided it, and this day was\neven worse than most. The arrival of the army had sparked a last-minute\nflurry of buying and selling, the people trying to get ready for whatever was\nto come. There was a grim tone to the atmosphere. Fewer street performers,\nmore yelling. Elend had ordered all eight city gates barred, so flight was no\nlonger an option. Vin wondered how many of the people regretted their\ndecision to stay.\nShe walked down the street with a businesslike step, hands clasped to\nkeep the nervousness out of her posture. Even as a child—an urchin on the\nstreets of a dozen different cities—she hadn't liked crowds. It was hard to\nkeep track of so many people, hard to focus with so much going on. As a\nchild, she'd stayed near the edges of crowds, hiding, venturing out to snatch\nthe occasional fallen coin or ignored bit of food.\nShe was different now. She forced herself to walk with a straight back,\nand kept her eyes from glancing down or looking for places to hide. She\nwas getting so much better—but seeing the crowds reminded her of what\nshe had once been. What she would always—at least in part—still be.\nAs if in response to her thoughts, a pair of street urchins scampered\nthrough the throng, a large man in a baker's apron screaming at them. There\nwere still urchins in Elend's new world. In fact, as she considered it, paying\nthe skaa population probably made for a far better street life for urchins.\nThere were more pockets to pick, more people to distract the shop owners,\nmore scraps to go around, and more hands to feed beggars.\nIt was difficult to reconcile her childhood with such a life. To her, a\nchild on the street was someone who learned to be quiet and hide, someone\nwho went out at night to search through garbage. Only the most brave of\nurchins had dared cut purses; skaa lives had been worthless to many\nnoblemen. During her childhood, Vin had known several urchins who been\nkilled or maimed by passing noblemen who found them offensive.\nElend's laws might not have eliminated the poor, something he so\nmuch wanted to do, but he had improved the lives of even the street\nurchins. For that—among other things—she loved him.\nThere were still some noblemen in the crowd, men who had been\npersuaded by Elend or circumstances that their fortunes would be safer in\nthe city than without. They were desperate, weak, or adventuresome. Vin\nwatched one man pass, surrounded by a group of guards. He didn't give her\na second glance; to him, her simple clothing was reason enough to ignore\nher. No noblewoman would dress as she did.\nIs that what I am? she wondered, pausing beside a shop window,"

        "text": "a second glance; to him, her simple clothing was reason enough to ignore\nher. No noblewoman would dress as she did.\nIs that what I am? she wondered, pausing beside a shop window,\nlooking over the books inside—the sale of which had always been a small,\nbut profitable, market for the idle imperial nobility. She also used the glass\nreflection to make certain no one snuck up behind her. Am I a noblewoman?\nIt could be argued that she was noble simply by association. The king\nhimself loved her—had asked her to marry him—and she had been trained\nby the Survivor of Hathsin. Indeed, her father had been noble, even if her\nmother had been skaa. Vin reached up, fingering the simple bronze earring\nthat was the only thing she had as a memento of Mother.\nIt wasn't much. But, then, Vin wasn't sure she wanted to think about\nher mother all that much. The woman had, after all, tried to kill Vin. In fact,\nshe had killed Vin's full sister. Only the actions of Reen, Vin's half brother,\nhad saved her. He had pulled Vin, bloody, from the arms of a woman who\nhad shoved the earring into Vin's ear just moments before.\nAnd still Vin kept it. As a reminder, of sorts. The truth was, she didn't\nfeel like a noblewoman. At times, she thought she had more in common\nwith her insane mother than she did with the aristocracy of Elend's world.\nThe balls and parties she had attended before the Collapse—they had been a\ncharade. A dreamlike memory. They had no place in this world of\ncollapsing governments and nightly assassinations. Plus, Vin's part in the\nballs—pretending to be the girl Valette Renoux—had always been a sham.\nShe pretended still. Pretended not to be the girl who had grown up\nstarving on the streets, a girl who had been beaten far more often than she\nhad been befriended. Vin sighed, turning from the window. The next shop,\nhowever, drew her attention despite herself.\nIt contained ball gowns.\nThe shop was empty of patrons; few thought of gowns on the eve of an\ninvasion. Vin paused before the open doorway, held almost as if she were\nmetal being Pulled. Inside, dressing dummies stood posed in majestic\ngowns. Vin looked up at the garments, with their tight waists and tapering,\nbell-like skirts. She could almost imagine she was at a ball, soft music in\nthe background, tables draped in perfect white, Elend standing up on his\nbalcony, leafing through a book. . ..\nShe almost went in. But why bother? The city was about to be\nattacked. Besides, the garments were expensive. It had been different when\nshe'd spent Kelsier's money. Now she spent Elend's money—and Elend's\nmoney was the kingdom's money.\nShe turned from the gowns and walked back out onto the street. Those\naren't me anymore. Valette is useless to Elend—he needs a Mistborn, not an\nuncomfortable girl in a gown that she doesn't quite fill. Her wounds from\nthe night before, now firm bruises, were a reminder of her place. They were\nhealing well—she'd been burning pewter heavily all day—but she'd be stiff\nfor a while yet."

They were\nhealing well—she'd been burning pewter heavily all day—but she'd be stiff\nfor a while yet.\nVin quickened her pace, heading for the livestock pens. As she walked,\nhowever, she caught sight of someone tailing her.\nWell, perhaps \"tailing\" was too generous a word—the man certainly\nwasn't doing a very good job of going unnoticed. He was balding on top,\nbut wore the sides of his hair long. He wore a simple skaa's smock: a single-\npiece tan garment that was stained dark with ash.\nGreat, Vin thought. There was another reason she avoided the market\n—or any place where crowds of skaa gathered.\nShe sped up again, but the man hurried as well. Soon, his awkward\nmovements gained attention—but, instead of cursing him, most people\npaused reverently. Soon others joined him, and Vin had a small crowd\ntrailing her.\nA part of her wanted to just slap down a coin and shoot away. Yes, Vin\nthought to herself wryly, use Allomancy in the daylight. That'll make you\ninconspicuous.\nSo, sighing, she turned to confront the group. None of them looked\nparticularly threatening. The men wore trousers and dull shirts; the women\nwore one-piece, utilitarian dresses. Several more men wore single-piece,\nash-covered smocks.\nPriests of the Survivor.\n\"Lady Heir,\" one of them said, approaching and falling to his knees.\n\"Don't call me that,\" Vin said quietly.\nThe priest looked up at her. \"Please. We need direction. We have cast\noff the Lord Ruler. What do we do now?\"\nVin took a step backward. Had Kelsier understood what he was doing?\nHe had built up the skaa's faith in him, then had died a martyr to turn them\nin rage against the Final Empire. What had he thought would happen after\nthat? Could he have foreseen the Church of the Survivor—had he known\nthat they would replace the Lord Ruler with Kelsier himself as God?\nThe problem was, Kelsier had left his followers with no doctrine. His\nonly goal had been to defeat the Lord Ruler; partially to get his revenge,\npartially to seal his legacy, and partially—Vin hoped—because he had\nwanted to free the skaa.\nBut now what? These people must feel as she did. Set adrift, with no\nlight to guide them.\nVin could not be that light. \"I'm not Kelsier,\" she said quietly, taking\nanother step backward.\n\"We know,\" one of the men said. \"You're his heir—he passed on, and\nthis time you Survived.\"\n\"Please,\" a woman said, stepping forward, holding a young child in her\narms. \"Lady Heir. If the hand that struck down the Lord Ruler could touch\nmy child. . .\"\nVin tried to back away farther, but realized she was up against another\ncrowd of people. The woman stepped closer, and Vin finally raised an\nuncertain hand to the baby's forehead.\n\"Thank you,\" the woman said.\n\"You'll protect us, won't you, Lady Heir?\" asked a young man—no\nolder than Elend—with a dirty face but honest eyes. \"The priests say that"

Vin mumbled a halfhearted response, but\nturned and pushed her way through the crowd. The group of believers didn't\nfollow her, fortunately.\nShe was breathing deeply, though not from exertion, by the time she\nslowed. She moved into an alley between two shops, standing in the shade,\nwrapping her arms around herself. She had spent her life learning to remain\nunnoticed, to be quiet and unimportant. Now she could be none of those\nthings.\nWhat did the people expect of her? Did they really think that she could\nstop an army by herself? That was one lesson she'd learned very early into\nher training: Mistborn weren't invincible. One man, she could kill. Ten men\ncould give her trouble. An army. . .\nVin held herself and took a few calming breaths. Eventually, she\nmoved back out onto the busy street. She was near her destination now—a\nsmall, open-sided tent surrounded by four pens. The merchant lounged by\nit, a scruffy man who had hair on only half of his head—the right half. Vin\nstood for a moment, trying to decide if the odd hairstyle was due to disease,\ninjury, or preference.\nThe man perked up when he saw her standing at the edge of his pens.\nHe brushed himself off, throwing up a small amount of dust. Then he\nsauntered up to her, smiling with what teeth he still had, acting as if he\nhadn't heard—or didn't care—that there was an army just outside.\n\"Ah, young lady,\" he said. \"Lookin' for a pup? I've got some wee\nscamps that any girl is sure to love. Here, let me grab one. You'll agree it's\nthe cutest thing you ever seen.\"\nVin folded her arms as the man reached down to grab a puppy from\none of the pens. \"Actually,\" she said, \"I was looking for a wolfhound.\"\nThe merchant looked up. \"Wolfhound, miss? 'Tis no pet for a girl like\nyourself. Mean brutes, those. Let me find you a nice bobbie. Nice dogs,\nthose—smart, too.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, drawing him up short. \"You will bring me a\nwolfhound.\"\nThe man paused again, looking at her, scratching himself in several\nundignified places. \"Well, I guess I can see. . .\"\nHe wandered toward the pen farthest from the street. Vin waited\nquietly, nose downturned at the smell as the merchant yelled at a few of his\nanimals, selecting an appropriate one. Eventually, he pulled a leashed dog\nup to Vin. It was a wolfhound, if a small one—but it had sweet, docile eyes,\nand an obviously pleasant temperament.\n\"The runt of the litter,\" the merchant said. \"A good animal for a young\ngirl, I'd say. Will probably make an excellent hunter, too. These\nwolfhounds, they can smell better than any beast you seen.\""

These\nwolfhounds, they can smell better than any beast you seen.\"\nVin reached for her coin purse, but paused, looking down at the dog's\npanting face. It almost seemed to be smiling at her.\n\"Oh, for the Lord Ruler's sake,\" she snapped, pushing past the dog and\nmaster, stalking toward the back pens.\n\"Young lady?\" the merchant asked, following uncertainly.\nVin scanned the wolfhounds. Near the back, she spotted a massive\nblack and gray beast. It was chained to a post, and it regarded her defiantly,\na low growl rising in its throat.\nVin pointed. \"How much for that one in the back?\"\n\"That?\" the merchant asked. \"Good lady, that's a watchbeast. It's meant\nto be set loose on a lord's grounds to attack anyone who enters! It's the one\nof the meanest things you'll ever see!\"\n\"Perfect,\" Vin said, pulling out some coins.\n\"Good lady, I couldn't possibly sell you that beast. Not possibly at all.\nWhy, I'll bet it weighs half again as much as you do.\"\nVin nodded, then pulled open the pen gate and strode in. The merchant\ncried out, but Vin walked right up to the wolfhound. He began to bark\nwildly at her, frothing.\nSorry about this, Vin thought. Then, burning pewter, she ducked in and\nslammed her fist into the animal's head.\nThe animal froze, wobbled, then fell unconscious in the dirt. The\nmerchant stopped up short beside her, mouth open.\n\"Leash,\" Vin ordered.\nHe gave her one. She used it to tie the wolfhound's feet together, and\nthen—with a flare of pewter—she threw the animal over her shoulders. She\ncringed only slightly at the pain in her side.\nThis thing better not get drool on my shirt, she thought, handing the\nmerchant some coins and walking back toward the palace.\nVin slammed the unconscious wolfhound to the floor. The guards had\ngiven her some strange looks as she entered the palace, but she was getting\nused to those. She brushed off her hands.\n\"What is that?\" OreSeur asked. He'd made it back to her rooms at the\npalace, but his current body was obviously unusable. He'd needed to form\nmuscles in places that men didn't normally have them to even keep the\nskeleton together, and while he'd healed his wounds, his body looked\nunnatural. He still wore the bloodstained clothing from the night before.\n\"This,\" Vin said, pointing at the wolfhound, \"is your new body.\"\nOreSeur paused. \"That? Mistress, that is a dog.\"\n\"Yes,\" Vin said.\n\"I am a man.\"\n\"You're a kandra,\" Vin said. \"You can imitate flesh and muscle. What\nabout fur?\"\nThe kandra did not look pleased. \"I cannot imitate it,\" he said, \"but I\ncan use the beast's own fur, like I use its bones. However, surely there is—\"\n\"I'm not going to kill for you, kandra,\" Vin said. \"And even if I did kill\nsomeone, I wouldn't let you. . .eat them. Plus, this will be more"

Well, I'll tell them that I finally did—nobody will think\nto realize that my new pet hound is actually my kandra.\"\nShe turned, nodding toward the carcass. \"This will be very useful.\nPeople pay less attention to hounds than they do to humans, and so you'll be\nable to listen in on conversations.\"\nOreSeur's frown deepened. \"I will not do this thing easily. You will\nneed to compel me, by virtue of the Contract.\"\n\"Fine,\" Vin said. \"You're commanded. How long will it take?\"\n\"A regular body only takes a few hours,\" OreSeur said. \"This could\ntake longer. Getting that much fur to look right will be challenging.\"\n\"Get started, then,\" Vin said, turning toward the door. On her way,\nhowever, she noticed a small package sitting on her desk. She frowned,\nwalking over and taking off the lid. A small note sat inside.\nLady Vin,\nHere is the next alloy you requested. Aluminum is very difficult to\nacquire, but when a noble family recently left the city, I was able to buy\nsome of their diningware.\nI do not know if this one will work, but I believe it worth a try. I have\nmixed the aluminum with four percent copper, and found the outcome quite\npromising. I have read of this composition; it is called duralumin.\nYour servant, Terion\nVin smiled, setting aside the note and removing the rest of the box's\ncontents: a small pouch of metal dust and a thin silvery bar, both\npresumably of this \"duralumin\" metal. Terion was a master Allomantic\nmetallurgist. Though not an Allomancer himself, he had been mixing alloys\nand creating dusts for Mistborn and Mistings for most of his life.\nVin pocketed both pouch and bar, then turned toward OreSeur. The\nkandra regarded her with a flat expression.\n\"This came for me today?\" Vin asked, nodding to the box.\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"A few hours ago.\"\n\"And you didn't tell me?\"\n\"I'm sorry, Mistress,\" OreSeur said in his toneless way, \"but you did\nnot command me to tell you if packages arrived.\"\nVin ground her teeth. He knew how anxiously she'd been waiting for\nanother alloy from Terion. All of the previous aluminum alloys they'd tried\nhad turned out to be duds. It bothered her to know that there was another\nAllomantic metal out there somewhere, waiting to be discovered. She\nwouldn't be satisfied until she found it.\nOreSeur just sat where he was, bland expression on his face,\nunconscious wolfhound on the floor in front of him.\n\"Just get to work on that body,\" Vin said, spinning and leaving the\nroom to search for Elend.\nVin finally found Elend in his study, going over some ledgers with a\nfamiliar figure."

He'd retired to his rooms soon after his arrival the day\nbefore, and she hadn't seen much of him.\nDockson looked up and smiled. Stocky without being fat, he had short\ndark hair and still wore his customary half beard. \"Hello, Vin.\"\n\"How was Terris?\" she asked.\n\"Cold,\" Dockson replied. \"I'm glad to be back. Though I wish I hadn't\narrived to find that army here.\"\n\"Either way, we're glad you've returned, Dockson,\" Elend said. \"The\nkingdom practically fell apart without you.\"\n\"That hardly seems the case,\" Dockson said, closing his ledger and\nsetting it on the stack. \"All things—and armies—considered, it looks like\nthe royal bureaucracy held together fairly well in my absence. You hardly\nneed me anymore!\"\n\"Nonsense!\" Elend said.\nVin leaned against the door, eyeing the two men as they continued\ntheir discussion. They maintained their air of forced joviality. Both were\ndedicated to making the new kingdom work, even if it meant pretending\nthat they liked each other. Dockson pointed at places in the ledgers, talking\nabout finances and what he'd discovered in the outlying villages under\nElend's control.\nVin sighed, glancing across the room. Sunlight streamed through the\nroom's stained-glass rose window, throwing colors across the ledgers and\ntable. Even now, Vin still wasn't accustomed to the casual richness of a\nnoble keep. The window—red and lavender—was a thing of intricate\nbeauty. Yet, noblemen apparently found its like so commonplace that they\nhad put this one in the keep's back rooms, in the small chamber that Elend\nnow used as his study.\nAs one might expect, the room was piled with stacks of books. Shelves\nlined the walls from floor to ceiling, but they were no match for the sheer\nvolume of Elend's growing collection. She'd never cared much for Elend's\ntaste in books. They were mostly political or historical works, things with\ntopics as musty as their aged pages. Many of them had once been forbidden\nby the Steel Ministry, but somehow the old philosophers could make even\nsalacious topics seem boring.\n\"Anyway,\" Dockson said, finally closing his ledgers. \"I have some\nthings to do before your speech tomorrow, Your Majesty. Did Ham say\nthere's a city defense meeting that evening as well?\"\nElend nodded. \"Assuming I can get the Assembly to agree not to hand\nthe city over to my father, we'll need to come up with a strategy to deal with\nthis army. I'll send someone for you tomorrow night.\"\n\"Good,\" Dockson said. With that, he nodded to Elend, winked at Vin,\nthen made his way from the cluttered room.\nAs Dockson shut the door, Elend sighed, then relaxed back in his\noversized plush chair.\nVin walked forward. \"He really is a good man, Elend.\"\n\"Oh, I realize he is. Being a good man doesn't always make one\nlikable, however.\""

It's dog.\"\n\"Ah, good,\" Elend said. \"I was worried that you'd departed from your\nsenses. Now, is there any particular reason why you smell like dog?\"\n\"I went to the market and bought one, then carried it back and fed it to\nOreSeur, so it can be his new body.\"\nElend paused. \"Why, Vin. That's brilliant! Nobody will suspect a dog\nto be a spy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought of that before. . ..\"\n\"Someone must have,\" Vin said. \"I mean, it makes such sense. I\nsuspect those who thought of it, however, didn't share the knowledge.\"\n\"Good point,\" Elend said, relaxing back. Yet, from as close as they\nwere, she could still feel a tension in him.\nTomorrow's speech, Vin thought. He's worried about it.\n\"I must say, however,\" Elend said idly, \"that I find it a bit disappointing\nthat you're not wearing dog-scented perfume. With your social station, I\ncould see some of the local noblewomen trying to imitate you. That could\nbe amusing indeed.\"\nShe leaned up, looking at his smirking face. \"You know, Elend—\nsometimes it's bloody difficult to tell when you're teasing, and when you're\njust being dense.\"\n\"That makes me more mysterious, right?\"\n\"Something like that,\" she said, snuggling up against him again.\n\"Now, see, you don't understand how clever that is of me,\" he said. \"If\npeople can't tell when I'm being an idiot and when I'm being a genius,\nperhaps they'll assume my blunders are brilliant political maneuverings.\"\n\"As long as they don't mistake your actual brilliant moves for\nblunders.\"\n\"That shouldn't be difficult,\" Elend said. \"I fear I have few enough of\nthose for people to mistake.\""

Why\nhad she chosen Elend, rather than Kelsier? Kelsier had been the visionary,\nthe hero, the Mistborn.\n\"Kelsier was a great man,\" Vin said quietly as Elend began to stroke\nher hair. \"But. . .there were things about him, Elend. Frightening things. He\nwas intense, reckless, even a little bit cruel. Unforgiving. He'd slaughter\npeople without guilt or concern, just because they upheld the Final Empire\nor worked for the Lord Ruler.\n\"I could love him as a teacher and a friend. But I don't think I could\never love—not really love—a man like that. I don't blame him; he was of\nthe streets, like me. When you struggle so hard for life, you grow strong—"

Kell was a far better person\nthan they—he really could be kind, and he did sacrifice his life for the skaa.\nHowever, he was just so hard.\"\nShe closed her eyes, feeling Elend's warmth. \"You, Elend Venture, are\na good man. A truly good man.\"\n\"Good men don't become legends,\" he said quietly.\n\"Good men don't need to become legends.\" She opened her eyes,\nlooking up at him. \"They just do what's right anyway.\"\nElend smiled. Then he kissed the top of her head and leaned back.\nThey lay there for a time, in a room warm with sunlight, relaxing.\n\"He saved my life, once,\" Elend finally said.\n\"Who?\" Vin asked with surprise. \"Kelsier?\"\nElend nodded. \"That day after Spook and OreSeur were captured, the\nday Kelsier died. There was a battle in the square when Ham and some\nsoldiers tried to free the captives.\"\n\"I was there,\" Vin said. \"Hiding with Breeze and Dox in one of the\nalleyways.\"\n\"Really?\" Elend said, sounding a bit amused. \"Because I came looking\nfor you. I thought that they'd arrested you, along with OreSeur—he was\npretending to be your uncle, then. I tried to get to the cages to rescue you.\"\n\"You did what? Elend, it was a battlefield in that square! There was an\nInquisitor there, for the Lord Ruler's sake!\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said, smiling faintly. \"See, that Inquisitor is the one\nwho tried to kill me. It had its axe raised and everything. And then. .\n.Kelsier was there. He smashed into the Inquisitor, throwing it to the\nground.\"\n\"Probably just a coincidence,\" Vin said.\n\"No,\" Elend said softly. \"He meant it, Vin. He looked at me while he\nstruggled with the Inquisitor, and I saw it in his eyes. I've always wondered\nabout that moment; everyone tells me that Kelsier hated the nobility even\nmore than Dox does.\"\nVin paused. \"He. . .started to change a little at the end, I think.\"\n\"Change enough that he'd risk himself to protect a random nobleman?\"\n\"He knew that I loved you,\" Vin said, smiling faintly. \"I guess, in the\nend, that proved stronger than his hatred.\"\n\"I didn't realize. . .\" He trailed off as Vin turned, hearing something.\nFootsteps approaching. She sat up, and a second later, Ham poked his head\ninto the room. He paused when he saw Vin sitting in Elend's lap, however.\n\"Oh,\" Ham said. \"Sorry.\"\n\"No, wait,\" Vin said. Ham poked his head back in, and Vin turned to\nElend. \"I almost forgot why I came looking for you in the first place. I got a\nnew package from Terion today.\""

I got a\nnew package from Terion today.\"\n\"Another one?\" Elend asked. \"Vin, when are you going to give this\nup?\"\n\"I can't afford to,\" she said.\n\"It can't be all that important, can it?\" he asked. \"I mean, if everybody's\nforgotten what that last metal does, then it must not be very powerful.\"\n\"Either that,\" Vin said, \"or it was so amazingly powerful that the\nMinistry worked very hard to keep it a secret.\" She slid off of the chair to\nstand up, then took the pouch and thin bar out of her pocket. She handed the\nbar to Elend, who sat up in his plush chair.\nSilvery and reflective, the metal—like the aluminum from which it was\nmade—felt too light to be real. Any Allomancer who accidentally burned\naluminum had their other metal reserves stripped away from them, leaving\nthem powerless. Aluminum had been kept secret by the Steel Ministry; Vin\nhad only found out about it on the night when she'd been captured by the\nInquisitors, the same night she'd killed the Lord Ruler.\nThey had never been able to figure out the proper Allomantic alloy of\naluminum. Allomantic metals always came in pairs—iron and steel, tin and\npewter, copper and bronze, zinc and brass. Aluminum and. . .something.\nSomething powerful, hopefully. Her atium was gone. She needed an edge.\nElend sighed, handing back the bar. \"The last time you tried to burn\none of those it left you sick for two days, Vin. I was terrified.\"\n\"It can't kill me,\" Vin said. \"Kelsier promised that burning a bad alloy\nwould only make me sick.\"\nElend shook his head. \"Even Kelsier was wrong on occasion, Vin.\nDidn't you say that he misunderstood how bronze worked?\"\nVin paused. Elend's concern was so genuine that she felt herself being\npersuaded. However. . .\nWhen that army attacks, Elend is going to die. The city's skaa might\nsurvive—no ruler would be foolish enough to slaughter the people of such a\nproductive city. The king, however, would be killed. She couldn't fight off\nan entire army, and she could do little to help with preparations.\nShe did know Allomancy, however. The better she got at it, the better\nshe'd be able to protect the man she loved.\n\"I have to try it, Elend,\" she said quietly. \"Clubs says that Straff won't\nattack for a few days—he'll need that long to rest his men from the march\nand scout the city for attack. That means I can't wait. If this metal does\nmake me sick, I'll be better in time to help fight—but only if I try it now.\"\nElend's face grew grim, but he did not forbid her. He had learned better\nthan that. Instead, he stood. \"Ham, you think this is a good idea?\"\nHam nodded. He was a warrior; to him, her gamble would make sense.\nShe'd asked him to stay because she'd need someone to carry her back to\nher bed, should this go wrong."

He was a warrior; to him, her gamble would make sense.\nShe'd asked him to stay because she'd need someone to carry her back to\nher bed, should this go wrong.\n\"All right,\" Elend said, turning back to Vin, looking resigned.\nVin climbed into the chair, sat back, then took a pinch of the duralumin\ndust and swallowed it. She closed her eyes, and felt at her Allomantic\nreserves. The common eight were all there, well stocked. She didn't have\nany atium or gold, nor did she have either of their alloys. Even if she'd had\natium, it was too precious to use except in an emergency—and the other\nthree had only marginal usefulness.\nA new reserve appeared. Just as one had the four times before. Each\ntime she'd burned an aluminum alloy, she'd immediately felt a blinding\nheadache. You'd think I'd have learned. . .she thought. Gritting her teeth, she\nreached inside and burned the new alloy.\nNothing happened.\n\"Have you tried it yet?\" Elend asked apprehensively.\nVin nodded slowly. \"No headache. But. . .I'm not sure if the alloy is\ndoing anything or not.\"\n\"But it's burning?\" Ham asked.\nVin nodded. She felt the familiar warmth from within, the tiny fire that\ntold her that a metal was burning. She tried moving about a bit, but couldn't\ndistinguish any change to her physical self. Finally she just looked up and\nshrugged.\nHam frowned. \"If it didn't make you sick, then you've found the right\nalloy. Each metal only has one valid alloy.\"\n\"Or,\" Vin said, \"that's what we've always been told.\"\nHam nodded. \"What alloy was this?\"\n\"Aluminum and copper,\" Vin said.\n\"Interesting,\" Ham said. \"You don't feel anything at all?\"\nVin shook her head.\n\"You'll have to practice some more.\"\n\"Looks like I'm lucky,\" Vin said, extinguishing the duralumin. \"Terion\ncame up with forty different alloys he thought we could try, once we had\nenough aluminum. This was only the fifth.\"\n\"Forty?\" Elend asked incredulously. \"I wasn't aware that there were so\nmany metals you could make an alloy from!\"\n\"You don't have to have two metals to make an alloy,\" Vin said\nabsently. \"Just one metal and something else. Look at steel—it's iron and\ncarbon.\"\n\"Forty. . .\" Elend repeated. \"And you would have tried them all?\"\nVin shrugged. \"Seemed like a good place to start.\"\nElend looked concerned at that thought, but didn't say anything further.\nInstead, he turned to Ham. \"Anyway, Ham, was there something you\nwanted to see us about?\"\n\"Nothing important,\" Ham said. \"I just wanted to see if Vin was up for\nsome sparring. That army has me feeling antsy, and I figure Vin could still\nuse some practice with the staff.\"\nVin shrugged. \"Sure. Why not?\"\n\"You want to come, El?\" Ham asked. \"Get in some practice?\"\nElend laughed. \"And face one of you two? I've got my royal dignity to\nthink of!\"\nVin frowned slightly, looking up at him. \"You really should practice"

You barely know how to hold a sword, and you're terrible\nwith a dueling cane.\"\n\"Now, see, why would I worry about that when I have you to protect\nme?\"\nVin's concern deepened. \"We can't always be around you, Elend. I'd\nworry a lot less if you were better at defending yourself.\"\nHe just smiled and pulled her to her feet. \"I'll get to it eventually, I\npromise. But, not today—I've got too much to think about right now. How\nabout if I just come watch you two? Perhaps I'll pick up something by\nobservation—which is, by the way, the preferable method of weapons\ntraining, since it doesn't involve me getting beaten up by a girl.\"\nVin sighed, but didn't press the point further.\nI write this record now, pounding it into a metal slab, because I am\nafraid. Afraid for myself, yes—I admit to being human. If Alendi does return\nfrom the Well of Ascension, I am certain that my death will be one of his\nfirst objectives. He is not an evil man, but he is a ruthless one. That is, I\nthink, a product of what he has been through.\n6\nELEND LEANED DOWN AGAINST THE railing, looking in at the\nsparring yard. Part of him did wish to go out and practice with Vin and\nHam. However, the larger part of him just didn't see the point.\nAny assassin likely to come after me will be an Allomancer, he\nthought. I could train ten years and be no match for one of them.\nIn the yard itself, Ham took a few swings with his staff, then nodded.\nVin stepped up, holding her own staff, which was a good foot taller than she\nwas. Watching the two of them, Elend couldn't help remarking on the\ndisparity. Ham had the firm muscles and powerful build of a warrior. Vin\nlooked even thinner than usual, wearing only a tight buttoned shirt and a\npair of trousers, with no cloak to mask her size.\nThe inequality was enhanced by Ham's next words. \"We're practicing\nwith the staff, not practicing Pushing and Pulling. Don't use anything but\npewter, all right?\"\nVin nodded.\nIt was the way they often sparred. Ham claimed that there was no\nsubstitute for training and practice, no matter how powerful an Allomancer\none was. He let Vin use pewter, however, because he said the enhanced\nstrength and dexterity was disorienting unless one was accustomed to it.\nThe sparring field was like a courtyard. Situated in the palace barracks,\nit had an open-sided hallway built around it. Elend stood in this, roof\noverhead keeping the red sun out of his eyes. That was nice, for a light\nashfall had begun, and occasional flakes of ash floated down from the sky.\nElend crossed his arms on the railing. Soldiers passed occasionally in the\nhallway behind, bustling with activity. Some, however, paused to watch;\nVin and Ham's sparring sessions were something of a welcome diversion to\nthe palace guards.\nI should be working on my proposal, Elend thought. Not standing here"

Not standing here\nwatching Vin fight.\nBut. . .the tension of the last few days had been so pressing that he was\nfinding it difficult to get up the motivation to do yet another read-through of\nthe speech. What he really needed was to just spend a few moments\nthinking.\nSo, he simply watched. Vin approached Ham warily, staff held in a\nfirm, two-handed stance. Once, Elend probably would have found trousers\nand shirt on a lady to be inappropriate, but he'd been around Vin too long to\nstill be bothered by that. Ball gowns and dresses were beautiful—but there\nwas something right about Vin in simple garb. She wore it more\ncomfortably.\nBesides, he kind of liked how the tight clothing looked on her.\nVin usually let others strike first, and this day was no exception. Staves\nrapped as Ham engaged her, and despite her size, Vin held her own. After a\nquick exchange, they both backed away, circling warily.\n\"My money's on the girl.\"\nElend turned as he noticed a form limping down the hallway toward\nhim. Clubs stepped up beside Elend, setting a ten-boxing coin down on the\nrailing with a snap. Elend smiled to the general, and Clubs scowled back—\nwhich was generally accepted as Clubs's version of a smile. Dockson\nexcluded, Elend had taken quickly to the other members of Vin's crew.\nClubs, however, had taken a little getting used to. The stocky man had a\nface like a gnarled toadstool, and he always seemed to be squinting in\ndispleasure—an expression usually matched by his tone of voice.\nHowever, he was a gifted craftsman, not to mention an Allomancer—a\nSmoker, actually, though he didn't get to use his power much anymore. For\nthe better part of a year, Clubs had acted as general of Elend's military\nforces. Elend didn't know where Clubs had learned to lead soldiers, but the\nman had a remarkable knack for it. He'd probably gotten the skill in the\nsame place that he'd acquired the scar on his leg—a scar that produced the\nhobble from which Clubs drew his nickname.\n\"They're just sparring, Clubs,\" Elend said. \"There won't be a 'winner.'\"\n\"They'll end with a serious exchange,\" Clubs said. \"They always do.\"\nElend paused. \"You're asking me to bet against Vin, you know,\" he\nnoted. \"That could be unhealthy.\"\n\"So?\"\nElend smiled, pulling out a coin. Clubs still kind of intimidated him,\nand he didn't want to risk offending the man.\n\"Where's that worthless nephew of mine?\" Clubs asked as he watched\nthe sparring.\n\"Spook?\" Elend asked. \"He's back? How'd he get into the city?\"\nClubs shrugged. \"He left something on my doorstep this morning.\"\n\"A gift?\"\nClubs snorted. \"It was a woodcarving from a master carpenter up in\nYelva City. The note said, 'I just wanted to show you what real carpenters\nare up to, old man.'\"\nElend chuckled, but trailed off as Clubs eyed him with a discomforting"

Or, was he serious? Elend couldn't\never decide if the man was as crusty as he seemed, or if Elend was the butt\nof some elaborate joke.\n\"How is the army doing?\" Elend finally asked.\n\"Terribly,\" Clubs said. \"You want an army? Give me more than one\nyear to train it. Right now, I'd barely trust those boys against a mob of old\nwomen with sticks.\"\nGreat, Elend thought.\n\"Can't do much right now, though,\" Clubs grumbled. \"Straff is digging\nin some cursory fortifications, but mostly he's just resting his men. The\nattack will come by the end of the week.\"\nIn the courtyard, Vin and Ham continued to fight. It was slow, for the\nmoment, Ham taking time to pause and explain principles or stances. Elend\nand Clubs watched for a short time as the sparring gradually became more\nintense, the rounds taking longer, the two participants beginning to sweat as\ntheir feet kicked up puffs of ash in the packed, sooty earth.\nVin gave Ham a good contest despite the ridiculous differences in\nstrength, reach, and training, and Elend found himself smiling slightly\ndespite himself. She was something special—Elend had realized that when\nhe'd first seen her in the Venture ballroom, nearly two years before. He was\nonly now coming to realize how much of an understatement \"special\" was.\nA coin snapped against the wooden railing. \"My money's on Vin, too.\"\nElend turned with surprise. The man who had spoken was a soldier\nwho had been standing with the others watching behind. Elend frowned.\n\"Who—\"\nThen, Elend cut himself off. The beard was wrong, the posture too\nstraight, but the man standing behind him was familiar. \"Spook?\" Elend\nasked incredulously.\nThe teenage boy smiled behind an apparently fake beard. \"Wasing the\nwhere of calling out.\"\nElend's head immediately began to hurt. \"Lord Ruler, don't tell me\nyou've gone back to the dialect?\"\n\"Oh, just for the occasional nostalgic quip,\" Spook said with a laugh.\nHis words bore traces of his Easterner accent; during the first few months\nElend had known the boy, Spook had been utterly unintelligible.\nFortunately, the boy had grown out of using his street cant, just as he'd\nmanaged to grow out of most of his clothing. Well over six feet tall, the\nsixteen-year-old young man hardly resembled the gangly boy Elend had\nmet a year before.\nSpook leaned against the railing beside Elend, adopting a teenage boy's\nlounging posture and completely destroying his image as a soldier—which,\nindeed, he wasn't.\n\"Why the costume, Spook?\" Elend asked with a frown.\nSpook shrugged. \"I'm no Mistborn.

Before Dockson,\nactually. I just thought I'd take a bit of a break before I went back to duty.\"\n\"I don't know if you've noticed, Spook,\" Elend said, \"but we're at war.\nThere isn't a lot of time to take breaks.\"\nSpook shrugged. \"I just didn't want you to send me away again. If\nthere's going to be war here, I want to be around. You know, for the\nexcitement.\"\nClubs snorted. \"And where did you get that uniform?\"\n\"Uh. . .Well. . .\" Spook glanced to the side, displaying just a hint of the\nuncertain boy Elend had known.\nClubs grumbled something about insolent boys, but Elend just laughed\nand clapped Spook on the shoulder. The boy looked up, smiling; though\nhe'd been easy to ignore at first, he was proving as valuable as any of the\nother members of Vin's former crew. As a Tineye—a Misting who could\nburn tin to enhance his senses—Spook could listen to conversations from\nfar away, not to mention notice distant details.\n\"Anyway, welcome back,\" Elend said. \"What's the word from the\nwest?\"\nSpook shook his head. \"I hate to sound too much like Uncle Crusty\nover there, but the news isn't good. You know those rumors about the Lord\nRuler's atium being in Luthadel? Well, they're back. Stronger this time.\"\n\"I thought we were past that!\" Elend said. Breeze and his team had\nspent the better part of six months spreading rumors and manipulating the\nwarlords into believing that the atium must have been hidden in another\ncity, since Elend hadn't found it in Luthadel.\n\"Guess not,\" Spook said. \"And. . .I think someone's spreading these\nrumors intentionally. I've been on the street long enough to sense a planted\nstory, and this rumor smells wrong. Someone really wants the warlords to\nfocus on you.\"\nGreat, Elend thought. \"You don't know where Breeze is, do you?\"\nSpook shrugged, but he no longer seemed to be paying attention to\nElend. He was watching the sparring. Elend glanced back toward Vin and\nHam.\nAs Clubs had predicted, the two had fallen into a more serious contest.\nThere was no more instruction; there were no more quick, repetitive\nexchanges. They sparred in earnest, fighting in a swirling melee of staffs\nand dust. Ash flew around them, blown up by the wind of their attacks, and\neven more soldiers paused in the surrounding hallways to watch.\nElend leaned forward.

Somehow, Vin got her own\nweapon up in time, but the power of Ham's blow threw her back in a\ntumble. She hit the ground on one shoulder. She gave barely a grunt of pain,\nhowever, and somehow got a hand beneath her, throwing herself up to land\non her feet. She skidded for a moment, retaining her balance, holding her\nstaff up.\nPewter, Elend thought. It made even a clumsy man dexterous. And, for\na person normally graceful like Vin. . .\nVin's eyes narrowed, her innate stubbornness showing in the set of her\njaw, the displeasure in her face. She didn't like being beaten—even when\nher opponent was obviously stronger than she was.\nElend stood up straight, intending to suggest an end to the sparring. At\nthat moment, Vin dashed forward.\nHam brought his staff up expectantly, swinging as Vin came within\nreach. She ducked to the side, passing within inches of the attack, then\nbrought her weapon around and slammed it into the back of Ham's staff,\nthrowing him off balance. Then she ducked in for the attack.\nHam, however, recovered quickly. He let the force of Vin's blow spin\nhim around, and he used the momentum to bring his staff around in a\npowerful blow aimed directly at Vin's chest.\nElend cried out.\nVin jumped.\nShe didn't have metal to Push against, but that didn't seem to matter.\nShe sprang a good seven feet in the air, easily cresting Ham's staff. She\nflipped as the swing passed beneath her, her fingers brushing the air just\nabove the weapon, her own staff spinning in a one-handed grip.\nVin landed, her staff already howling in a low swing, its tip throwing\nup a line of ash as it ran along the ground. It slammed into the back of\nHam's legs. The blow swept Ham's feet out from beneath him, and he cried\nout as he fell.\nVin jumped into the air again.\nHam slammed to the earth on his back, and Vin landed on his chest.\nThen, she calmly rapped him on the forehead with the end of her staff. \"I\nwin.\"\nHam lay, looking dazed, Vin crouching on his chest. Dust and ash\nsettled quietly in the courtyard.\n\"Damn. . .\" Spook whispered, voicing a sentiment that seemed to be\nshared by the dozen or so watching soldiers.\nFinally, Ham chuckled. \"Fine. You beat me—now, if you would,\nkindly get me something to drink while I try to massage some feeling back\ninto my legs.\"\nVin smiled, hopping off his chest and scampering away to do as\nrequested. Ham shook his head, climbing to his feet. Despite his words, he\nwalked with barely a limp; he'd probably have a bruise, but it wouldn't\nbother him for long.

She's never where I think she'll be.\"\n\"How did she do that, Ham?\" Elend asked. \"The jump, I mean. That\nleap seemed inhuman, even for an Allomancer.\"\n\"Used steel, didn't she?\" Spook said.\nHam shook his head. \"No, I doubt it.\"\n\"Then how?\" Elend asked.\n\"Allomancers draw strength from their metals,\" Ham said, sighing and\nputting his foot down. \"Some can squeeze out more than others—but the\nreal power comes from the metal itself, not the person's body.\"\nElend paused. \"So?\"\n\"So,\" Ham said, \"an Allomancer doesn't have to be physically strong to\nbe incredibly powerful. If Vin were a Feruchemist, it would be different—if\nyou ever see Sazed increase his strength, his muscles will grow larger. But\nwith Allomancy, all the strength comes directly from the metal.\n\"Now, most Thugs—myself included—figure that making their bodies\nstrong will only add to their power. After all, a muscular man burning\npewter will be that much stronger than a regular man of the same\nAllomantic power.\"\nHam rubbed his chin, eyeing the passage Vin had left through. \"But. .\n.well, I'm beginning to think that there might be another way. Vin's a thin\nlittle thing, but when she burns pewter, she grows several times stronger\nthan any normal warrior. She packs all that strength into a small body, and\ndoesn't have to bother with the weight of massive muscles. She's like. . .an\ninsect. Far stronger than her mass or her body would indicate. So, when she\njumps, she can jump.\"\n\"But you're still stronger than she is,\" Spook said.\nHam nodded. \"And I can make use of that—assuming I can ever hit\nher. That's getting harder and harder to do.\"\nVin finally returned, carrying a jug of chilled juice—apparently she'd\ndecided to go all the way to the keep, rather than grabbing some of the\nwarm ale kept on hand in the courtyard. She handed a flagon to Ham, and\nhad thought to bring cups for Elend and Clubs.\n\"Hey!\" Spook said as she poured. \"What about me?\"\n\"That beard looks silly on you,\" Vin said as she poured.\n\"So I don't get anything to drink?\"\n\"No.\"\nSpook paused. \"Vin, you're a strange girl.\"\nVin rolled her eyes; then she glanced toward the water barrel in the\ncorner of the courtyard. One of the tin cups lying beside it lurched into the\nair, shooting across the courtyard.

The old general then reached\nover, sliding two of the coins off the railing and pocketing them.\n\"Hey, that's right!\" Spook said. \"You owe me, El. Pay up.\"\nElend lowered his cup. \"I never agreed to the bet.\"\n\"You paid Uncle Irritable. Why not me?\"\nElend paused, then sighed, pulling out a ten-boxing coin and setting it\nbeside Spook's. The boy smiled, plucking both up in a smooth street-thief\ngesture. \"Thanks for winning the bout, Vin,\" he said with a wink.\nVin frowned at Elend. \"You bet against me?\"\nElend laughed, leaning across the railing to kiss her. \"I didn't mean it.\nClubs bullied me.\"\nClubs snorted at that comment, downed the rest of his juice, then held\nout his cup for a refill. When Vin didn't respond, he turned to Spook and\ngave the boy a telling scowl. Finally, Spook sighed, picking up the jug to\nrefill the cup.\nVin was still regarding Elend with dissatisfaction.\n\"I'd be careful, Elend,\" Ham said with a chuckle. \"She can hit pretty\nhard. . ..\"\nElend nodded. \"I should know better than to antagonize her when there\nare weapons lying around, eh?\"\n\"Tell me about it,\" Ham said.\nVin sniffed at that comment, rounding the railing so that she could\nstand next to Elend. Elend put his arm around her, and as he did, he caught\na bare flash of envy in Spook's eyes. Elend suspected that the boy'd had a\ncrush on Vin for some time—but, well, Elend couldn't really blame him for\nthat.\nSpook shook his head. \"I've got to find myself a woman.\"\n\"Well, that beard isn't going to help,\" Vin said.\n\"It's just a disguise, Vin,\" Spook said. \"El, I don't suppose you could\ngive me a title or something?\"\nElend smiled. \"I don't think that will matter, Spook.\"\n\"It worked for you.\"\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Elend said. \"Somehow, I think Vin fell in love with\nme despite my title, rather than because of it.\"\n\"But you had others before her,\" Spook said. \"Noble girls.\"\n\"A couple,\" Elend admitted.\n\"Though Vin has a habit of killing off her competition,\" Ham quipped.\nElend laughed. \"Now, see, she only did that once. And I think Shan\ndeserved it—she was, after all, trying to assassinate me at the time.\" He\nlooked down fondly, eyeing Vin. \"Though, I do have to admit, Vin is a bit\nhard on other women. With her around, everybody else looks bland by\ncomparison.\"\nSpook rolled his eyes. \"It's more interesting when she kills them off.\"\nHam chuckled, letting Spook pour him some more juice. \"Lord Ruler\nonly knows what she'd do to you if you ever tried to leave her, Elend.\"\nVin stiffened immediately, pulling him a little tighter.

Even after what they'd been through, even\nafter his proposal of marriage, Elend had to keep promising Vin that he\nwasn't going to leave her.\nTime to change the topic, Elend thought, the joviality of the moment\nfading. \"Well,\" he said, \"I think I'm going to go visit the kitchens and get\nsomething to eat. You coming, Vin?\"\nVin glanced at the sky—likely checking to see how soon it would\ngrow dark. Finally, she nodded.\n\"I'll come,\" Spook said.\n\"No you won't,\" Clubs said, grabbing the boy by the back of the neck.\n\"You're going to stay right here and explain exactly where you got one of\nmy soldiers' uniforms.\"\nElend chuckled, leading Vin away. Truth be told, even with the slightly\nsour end of conversation, he felt better for having come to watch the\nsparring. It was strange how the members of Kelsier's crew could laugh and\nmake light, even during the most terrible of situations. They had a way of\nmaking him forget about his problems. Perhaps that was a holdover from\nthe Survivor. Kelsier had, apparently, insisted on laughing, no matter how\nbad the situation. It had been a form of rebellion to him.\nNone of that made the problems go away. They still faced an army\nseveral times larger than their own, in a city that they could barely defend.\nYet, if anyone could survive such a situation, it would be Kelsier's crew.\nLater that night, having filled her stomach at Elend's insistence, Vin\nmade her way with Elend to her rooms.\nThere, sitting on the floor, was a perfect replica of the wolfhound she\nhad bought earlier. It eyed her, then bowed its head. \"Welcome back,\nMistress,\" the kandra said in a growling, muffled voice.\nElend whistled appreciatively, and Vin walked in a circle around the\ncreature. Each hair appeared to have been placed perfectly. If it hadn't\nspoken, one would never have been able to tell it wasn't the original dog.\n\"How do you manage the voice?\" Elend asked curiously.\n\"A voice box is a construction of flesh, not bone, Your Majesty,\"\nOreSeur said. \"Older kandra learn to manipulate their bodies, not just\nreplicate them. I still need to digest a person's corpse to memorize and re-\ncreate their exact features. However, I can improvise some things.\"\nVin nodded. \"Is that why making this body took you so much longer\nthan you'd said?\"\n\"No, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"The hair. I'm sorry I didn't warn you—\nplacing fur like this takes a great deal of precision and effort.\"\n\"Actually, you did mention it,\" Vin said, waving her hand.\n\"What do you think of the body, OreSeur?\" Elend asked.\n\"Honestly, Your Majesty?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"It is offensive and degrading,\" OreSeur said.\nVin raised an eyebrow. That's forward of you, Renoux, she thought.\nFeeling a little belligerent today, are we?\nHe glanced at her, and she tried—unsuccessfully—to read his canine\nexpression."

It is life.\"\nElend nodded to Vin, as if he'd just made a major point.\nAnyone can claim loyalty, Vin thought. If someone has a \"Contract\" to\nensure their honor, then all the better. That makes the surprise more\npoignant when they do turn on you.\nElend was obviously waiting for something. Vin sighed. \"OreSeur,\nwe'll be spending more time together in the future.\"\n\"If that is what you wish, Mistress.\"\n\"I'm not sure if it is or not,\" Vin said. \"But it's going to happen anyway.\nHow well can you move about in that body?\"\n\"Well enough, Mistress.\"\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"let's see if you can keep up.\"\nI am also afraid, however, that all I have known—that my story—will\nbe forgotten. I am afraid for the world that is to come. Afraid that my plans\nwill fail.\nAfraid of a doom worse, even, than the Deepness.\n7\nSAZED NEVER THOUGHT HE'D HAVE reason to appreciate dirt\nfloors. However, they proved remarkably useful in writing instruction. He\ndrew several words in the dirt with a long stick, giving his half-dozen\nstudents a model. They proceeded to scribble their own copies, rewriting\nthe words several times.\nEven after living among various groups of rural skaa for a year, Sazed\nwas still surprised by their meager resources. There wasn't a single piece of\nchalk in the entire village, let alone ink or paper. Half the children ran\naround naked, and the only shelters were the hovels—long, one-room\nstructures with patchy roofs. The skaa had farming tools, fortunately, but no\nmanner of bows or slings for hunting.\nSazed had led a scavenging mission up to the plantation's abandoned\nmanor. The leavings had been meager. He'd suggested that the village elders\nrelocate their people to the manor itself for the winter, but he doubted they\nwould do so. They had visited the manor with apprehension, and many\nhadn't been willing to leave Sazed's side. The place reminded them of lords\n—and lords reminded them of pain.\nHis students continued to scribble. He had spent quite a bit of effort\nexplaining to the elders why writing was so important. Finally, they had\nchosen him some students—partially, Sazed was sure, just to appease him.\nHe shook his head slowly as he watched them write. There was no passion\nin their learning. They came because they were ordered, and because\n\"Master Terrisman\" willed it, not because of any real desire for education.\nDuring the days before the Collapse, Sazed had often imagined what\nthe world would be like once the Lord Ruler was gone. He had pictured the\nKeepers emerging, bringing forgotten knowledge and truths to an excited,\nthankful populace. He'd imagined teaching before a warm hearth at night,\ntelling stories to an eager audience. He'd never paused to consider a village,"

He'd imagined teaching before a warm hearth at night,\ntelling stories to an eager audience. He'd never paused to consider a village,\nstripped of its working men, whose people were too exhausted at night to\nbother with tales from the past. He'd never imagined a people who seemed\nmore annoyed by his presence than thankful.\nYou must be patient with them, Sazed told himself sternly. His dreams\nnow seemed like hubris. The Keepers who had come before him, the\nhundreds who had died keeping their knowledge safe and quiet, had never\nexpected praise or accolades. They had performed their great task with\nsolemn anonymity.\nSazed stood up and inspected his students' writings. They were getting\nbetter—they could recognize all of the letters. It wasn't much, but it was a\nstart. He nodded to the group, dismissing them to help prepare the evening\nmeal.\nThey bowed, then scattered. Sazed followed them out, then realized\nhow dim the sky was; he had probably kept his students too late. He shook\nhis head as he strolled between the hill-like hovels. He again wore his\nsteward's robes, with their colorful V-shaped patterns, and he had put in\nseveral of his earrings. He kept to the old ways because they were familiar,\neven though they were also a symbol of oppression. How would future\nTerris generations dress? Would a lifestyle forced upon them by the Lord\nRuler become an innate part of their culture?\nHe paused at the edge of the village, glancing down the corridor of the\nsouthern valley. It was filled with blackened soil occasionally split by\nbrown vines or shrubs. No mist, of course; mist came only during the night.\nThe stories had to be mistakes. The thing he'd seen had to have been a fluke.\nAnd what did it matter if it wasn't? It wasn't his duty to investigate\nsuch things. Now that the Collapse had come, he had to disperse his\nknowledge, not waste his time chasing after foolish stories. Keepers were\nno longer investigators, but instructors. He carried with him thousands of\nbooks—information about farming, about sanitation, about government,\nand about medicine. He needed to give these things to the skaa. That was\nwhat the Synod had decided.\nAnd yet, a part of Sazed resisted. That made him feel deeply guilty; the\nvillagers needed his teachings, and he wished dearly to help them.\nHowever. . .he felt that he was missing something. The Lord Ruler was\ndead, but the story did not seem finished. Was there something he had\noverlooked?\nSomething larger, even, than the Lord Ruler? Something so large, so\nbig, that it was effectively invisible?\nOr, do I just want there to be something else? he wondered. I've spent\nmost of my adult life resisting and fighting, taking risks that the other\nKeepers called mad. I wasn't content with feigned subservience—I had to\nget involved in the rebellion.\nDespite that rebellion's success, Sazed's brethren still hadn't forgiven\nhim for his involvement. He knew that Vin and the others saw him as\ndocile, but compared with other Keepers he was a wild man. A reckless,\nuntrustworthy fool who threatened the entire order with his impatience."

A reckless,\nuntrustworthy fool who threatened the entire order with his impatience.\nThey had believed their duty was to wait, watching for the day when the\nLord Ruler was gone. Feruchemists were too rare to risk in open rebellion.\nSazed had disobeyed. Now he was having trouble living the peaceful\nlife of a teacher. Was that because some subconscious part of him knew that\nthe people were still in danger, or was it because he simply couldn't accept\nbeing marginalized?\n\"Master Terrisman!\"\nSazed spun. The voice was terrified. Another death in the mists? he\nthought immediately.\nIt was eerie how the other skaa remained inside their hovels despite the\nhorrified voice. A few doors creaked, but nobody rushed out in alarm—or\neven curiosity—as the screamer dashed up to Sazed. She was one of the\nfieldworkers, a stout, middle-aged woman. Sazed checked his reserves as\nshe approached; he had on his pewtermind for strength, of course, and a\nvery small steel ring for speed. Suddenly, he wished he'd chosen to wear\njust a few more bracelets this day.\n\"Master Terrisman!\" the woman said, out of breath. \"Oh, he's come\nback! He's come for us!\"\n\"Who?\" Sazed asked. \"The man who died in the mists?\"\n\"No, Master Terrisman. The Lord Ruler.\"\nSazed found him standing just outside the village. It was already\ngrowing dark, and the woman who'd fetched Sazed had returned to her\nhovel in fear. Sazed could only imagine how the poor people felt—trapped\nby the onset of the night and its mist, yet huddled and worried at the danger\nthat lurked outside.\nAnd an ominous danger it was. The stranger waited quietly on the\nworn road, wearing a black robe, standing almost as tall as Sazed himself.\nThe man was bald, and he wore no jewelry—unless, of course, you counted\nthe massive iron spikes that had been driven point-first through his eyes.\nNot the Lord Ruler. A Steel Inquisitor.\nSazed still didn't understand how the creatures continued to live. The\nspikes were wide enough to fill the Inquisitor's entire eye sockets; the nails\nhad destroyed the eyes, and pointed tips jutted out the back of the skull. No\nblood dripped from the wounds—for some reason, that made them seem\nmore strange.\nFortunately, Sazed knew this particular Inquisitor. \"Marsh,\" Sazed said\nquietly as the mists began to form.\n\"You are a very difficult person to track, Terrisman,\" Marsh said—and\nthe sound of his voice shocked Sazed. It had changed, somehow, becoming\nmore grating, more gristly. It now had a grinding quality, like that of a man\nwith a cough. Just like the other Inquisitors Sazed had heard.\n\"Track?\" Sazed asked. \"I wasn't planning on others needing to find\nme.\"\n\"Regardless,\" Marsh said, turning south. \"I did. You need to come with\nme.\"\nSazed frowned. \"What? Marsh, I have a work to do here.\"\n\"Unimportant,\" Marsh said, turning back, focusing his eyeless gaze on\nSazed."

Marsh, I have a work to do here.\"\n\"Unimportant,\" Marsh said, turning back, focusing his eyeless gaze on\nSazed.\nIs it me, or has he become stranger since we last met? Sazed shivered.\n\"What is this about, Marsh?\"\n\"The Conventical of Seran is empty.\"\nSazed paused. The Conventical was a Ministry stronghold to the south\n—a place where the Inquisitors and high obligators of the Lord Ruler's\nreligion had retreated after the Collapse.\n\"Empty?\" Sazed asked. \"That isn't likely, I think.\"\n\"True nonetheless,\" Marsh said. He didn't use body language as he\nspoke—no gesturing, no movements of the face.\n\"I. . .\" Sazed trailed off. What kinds of information, wonders, secrets,\nthe Conventical's libraries must hold.\n\"You must come with me,\" Marsh said. \"I may need help, should my\nbrethren discover us.\"\nMy brethren. Since when are the Inquisitors Marsh's \"brethren\"?\nMarsh had infiltrated their numbers as part of Kelsier's plan to overthrow\nthe Final Empire. He was a traitor to their numbers, not their brother.\nSazed hesitated. Marsh's profile looked. . .unnatural, even unnerving,\nin the dim light. Dangerous.\nDon't be foolish, Sazed chastised himself. Marsh was Kelsier's brother\n—the Survivor's only living relative. As an Inquisitor, Marsh had authority\nover the Steel Ministry, and many of the obligators had listened to him\ndespite his involvement with the rebellion. He had been an invaluable\nresource for Elend Venture's fledgling government.\n\"Go get your things,\" Marsh said.\nMy place is here, Sazed thought. Teaching the people, not gallivanting\nacross the countryside, chasing my own ego.\nAnd yet. . .\n\"The mists are coming during the day,\" Marsh said quietly.\nSazed looked up. Marsh was staring at him, the heads of his spikes\nshining like round disks in the last slivers of sunlight. Superstitious skaa\nthought that Inquisitors could read minds, though Sazed knew that was\nfoolish. Inquisitors had the powers of Mistborn, and could therefore\ninfluence other people's emotions—but they could not read minds.\n\"Why did you say that?\" Sazed asked.\n\"Because it is true,\" Marsh said. \"This is not over, Sazed. It has not yet\nbegun. The Lord Ruler. . .he was just a delay. A cog. Now that he is gone,\nwe have little time remaining. Come with me to the Conventical—we must\nsearch it while we have the opportunity.\"\nSazed paused, then nodded. \"Let me go explain to the villagers. We\ncan leave tonight, I think.\"\nMarsh nodded, but he didn't move as Sazed retreated to the village. He\njust remained, standing in the darkness, letting the mist gather around him.\nIt all comes back to poor Alendi. I feel bad for him, and for all the\nthings he has been forced to endure.

An occasional, furtive bob of light\nglowed in the mists—a guard patrol, or perhaps an unfortunate late-night\ntraveler.\nVin began to descend, and she immediately flipped a coin out before\nherself. She Pushed against it, her weight plunging it down into the quiet\ndepths. As soon as it hit the street below, her Push forced her upward, and\nshe sprang back into the air. Soft Pushes were very difficult—so each coin\nshe Pushed against, each jump she made, threw her into the air at a terrible\nspeed. The jumping of a Mistborn wasn't like a bird's flight. It was more\nlike the path of a ricocheting arrow.\nAnd yet, there was a grace to it. Vin breathed deeply as she arced\nabove the city, tasting the cool, humid air. Luthadel by day smelled of\nburning forges, sun-heated refuse, and fallen ash. At night, however, the\nmists gave the air a beautiful chill crispness—almost a cleanliness.\nVin crested her jump, and she hung for just a brief moment as her\nmomentum changed. Then she began to plummet back toward the city. Her\nmistcloak tassels fluttered around her, mingling with her hair. She fell with\nher eyes closed, remembering her first few weeks in the mist, training\nbeneath Kelsier's relaxed—yet watchful—tutelage. He had given her this.\nFreedom. Despite two years as a Mistborn, she had never lost the sense of\nintoxicating wonder she felt when soaring through the mists.\nShe burned steel with her eyes closed; the lines appeared anyway,\nvisible as a spray of threadlike blue lines set against the blackness of her\neyelids. She picked two, pointing downward behind her, and Pushed,\nthrowing herself into an other arc.\nWhat did I ever do without this? Vin thought, opening her eyes,\nwhipping her mistcloak behind her with a throw of the arm.\nEventually, she began to fall again, and this time she didn't toss a coin.\nShe burned pewter to strengthen her limbs, and landed with a thump on the\nwall surrounding Keep Venture's grounds. Her bronze showed no signs of\nAllomantic activity nearby, and her steel revealed no unusual patterns of\nmetal moving toward the keep.\nVin crouched on the dark wall for a few moments, right at the edge,\ntoes curling over the lip of the stone. The rock was cool beneath her feet,\nand her tin made her skin far more sensitive than normal. She could tell that\nthe wall needed to be cleaned; lichens were beginning to grow along its\nside, encouraged by the night's humidity, protected from the day's sun by a\nnearby tower.\nVin remained quiet, watching a slight breeze push and churn the mists.\nShe heard the movement on the street below before she saw it. She tensed,\nchecking her reserves, before she was able to discern a wolfhound's shape\nin the shadows.\nShe dropped a coin over the side of the wall, then leapt off. OreSeur\nwaited as she landed quietly before him, using a quick Push on the coin to\nslow her descent."

That\nwolfhound's body is faster than a human one.\"\nOreSeur paused. \"I suppose,\" he admitted.\n\"Think you can follow me through the city?\"\n\"Probably,\" OreSeur said. \"If you lose me, I will return to this point so\nyou can retrieve me.\"\nVin turned and dashed down a side street. OreSeur then took off\nquietly behind her, following.\nLet's see how well he does in a more demanding chase, she thought,\nburning pewter and increasing her speed. She sprinted along the cool\ncobbles, barefoot as always. A normal man could never have maintained\nsuch a speed. Even a trained runner couldn't have kept pace with her, for he\nwould have quickly tired.\nWith pewter, however, Vin could run for hours at breakneck speeds. It\ngave her strength, lent her an unreal sense of balance, as she shot down the\ndark, mist-ruled street, a flurry of cloak tassels and bare feet.\nOreSeur kept pace. He loped beside her in the night, breathing heavily,\nfocused on his running.\nImpressive, Vin thought, then turned down an alleyway. She easily\njumped the six-foot-tall fence at the back, passing into the garden of some\nlesser nobleman's mansion. She spun, skidding on the wet grass, and\nwatched.\nOreSeur crested the top of the wooden fence, his dark, canine form\ndropping through the mists to land in the loam before Vin. He came to a\nstop, resting on his haunches, waiting quietly, panting. There was a look of\ndefiance in his eyes.\nAll right, Vin thought, pulling out a handful of coins. Follow this.\nShe dropped a coin and threw herself backward up into the air. She\nspun in the mists, twisting, then Pushed herself sideways off a well spigot.\nShe landed on a rooftop and jumped off, using another coin to Push herself\nover the street below.\nShe kept going, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, using coins when\nnecessary. She occasionally shot a glance behind, and saw a dark form\nstruggling to keep up. He'd rarely followed her as a human; usually, she had\nchecked in with him at specific points. Moving out in the night, jumping\nthrough the mists. . .this was the true domain of the Mistborn. Did Elend\nunderstand what he asked when he told her to bring OreSeur with her? If\nshe stayed down on the streets, she'd expose herself.\nShe landed on a rooftop, jarring to a sudden halt as she grabbed hold of\nthe building's stone lip, leaning out over a street three stories below. She\nmaintained her balance, mist swirling below her. All was silent.\nWell, that didn't take long, she thought. I'll just have to explain to\nElend that—\nOreSeur's canine form thumped to the rooftop a short distance away."

It was surprisingly easy to track you, even in the darkness.\"\n\"I. . .see,\" Vin said. \"Well, that's good.\"\n\"Might I ask, Mistress, the purpose of that chase?\"\nVin shrugged. \"I do this sort of thing every night.\"\n\"It seemed like you were particularly intent on losing me. It will be\nvery difficult to protect you if you don't let me stay near you.\"\n\"Protect me?\" Vin asked. \"You can't even fight.\"\n\"The Contract forbids me from killing a human,\" OreSeur said. \"I\ncould, however, go for help should you need it.\"\nOr throw me a bit of atium in a moment of danger, Vin admitted. He's\nright—he could be useful. Why am I so determined to leave him behind?\nShe glanced over at OreSeur, who sat patiently, his chest puffing from\nexertion. She hadn't realized that kandra even needed to breathe.\nHe ate Kelsier.\n\"Come on,\" Vin said. She jumped from the building, Pushing herself\noff a coin. She didn't pause to see if OreSeur followed.\nAs she fell, she reached for another coin, but decided not to use it. She\nPushed against a passing window bracket instead. Like most Mistborn, she\noften used clips—the smallest denomination of coin—to jump. It was very\nconvenient that the economy supplied a prepackaged bit of metal of an ideal\nsize and weight for jumping and shooting. To most Mistborn, the cost of a\nthrown clip—or even a bag of them—was negligible.\nBut Vin was not most Mistborn. In her younger years, a handful of\nclips would have seemed an amazing treasure. That much money could\nhave meant food for weeks, if she scrimped. It also could have meant pain\n—even death—if the other thieves had discovered that she'd obtained such a\nfortune.\nIt had been a long time since she'd gone hungry. Though she still kept\na pack of dried foods in her quarters, she did so more out of habit than\nanxiety. She honestly wasn't sure what she thought of the changes within\nher. It was nice not to have to worry about basic necessities—and yet, those\nworries had been replaced by ones far more daunting. Worries involving the\nfuture of an entire nation.\nThe future of. . .a people. She landed on the city wall—a structure"

She landed on the city wall—a structure\nmuch higher, and much better fortified, than the small wall around Keep\nVenture. She hopped up on the battlements, fingers seeking a hold on one of\nthe merlons as she leaned over the edge of the wall, looking out over the\narmy's fires.\nShe had never met Straff Venture, but she had heard enough from\nElend to be worried.\nShe sighed, pushing back off the battlement and hopping onto the wall\nwalk. Then she leaned back against one of the merlons. To the side,\nOreSeur trotted up the wall steps and approached. Once again, he went\ndown onto his haunches, watching patiently.\nFor better or for worse, Vin's simple life of starvation and beatings was\ngone. Elend's fledgling kingdom was in serious danger, and she'd burned\naway the last of his atium trying to keep herself alive. She'd left him\nexposed—not just to armies, but to any Mistborn assassin who tried to kill\nhim.\nAn assassin like the Watcher, perhaps? The mysterious figure who had\ninterfered in her fight against Cett's Mistborn. What did he want? Why did\nhe watch her, rather than Elend?\nVin sighed, reaching into her coin pouch and pulling out her bar of\nduralumin. She still had the reserve of it within her, the bit she'd swallowed\nearlier.\nFor centuries, it had been assumed that there were only ten Allomantic\nmetals: the four base metals and their alloys, plus atium and gold. Yet,\nAllomantic metals always came in pairs—a base metal and an alloy. It had\nalways bothered Vin that atium and gold were considered a pair, when\nneither was an alloy of the other. In the end, it had turned out that they\nweren't actually paired; they each had an alloy. One of these—malatium, the\nso-called Eleventh Metal—had eventually given Vin the clue she'd needed\nto defeat the Lord Ruler.\nSomehow Kelsier had found out about malatium. Sazed still hadn't\nbeen able to trace the \"legends\" that Kelsier had supposedly uncovered\nteaching of the Eleventh Metal and its power to defeat the Lord Ruler.\nVin rubbed her finger on the slick surface of the duralumin bar. When\nVin had last seen Sazed, he'd seemed frustrated—or, at least, as frustrated as\nSazed ever grew—that he couldn't find even hints regarding Kelsier's\nsupposed legends. Though Sazed claimed he'd left Luthadel to teach the\npeople of the Final Empire—as was his duty as a Keeper—Vin hadn't\nmissed the fact that Sazed had gone south. The direction in which Kelsier\nclaimed to have discovered the Eleventh Metal.\nAre there rumors about this metal, too? Vin wondered, rubbing the\nduralumin. Ones that might tell me what it does?\nEach of the other metals produced an immediate, visible effect; only\ncopper, with its ability to create a cloud that masked an Allomancer's\npowers from others, didn't have an obvious sensory clue to its purpose.\nPerhaps duralumin was similar. Could its effect be noticed only by another"

Could its effect be noticed only by another\nAllomancer, one trying to use his or her powers on Vin? It was the opposite\nof aluminum, which made metals disappear. Did that mean duralumin\nwould make other metals last longer?\nMovement.\nVin just barely caught the hint of shadowed motion. At first, a primal\nbit of terror rose in her: Was it the misty form, the ghost in the darkness she\nhad seen the night before?\nYou were just seeing things, she told herself forcefully. You were too\ntired. And, in truth, the glimmer of motion proved too dark—too real—to\nbe the same ghostly image.\nIt was him.\nHe stood atop one of the watchtowers—not crouching, not even\nbothering to hide. Was he arrogant or foolish, this unknown Mistborn? Vin\nsmiled, her apprehension turning to excitement. She prepared her metals,\nchecking her reserves. Everything was ready.\nTonight I catch you, my friend.\nVin spun, throwing out a spray of coins. Either the Mistborn knew he'd\nbeen spotted, or he was ready for an attack, for he easily dodged. OreSeur\nhopped to his feet, spinning, and Vin whipped her belt free, dropping her\nmetals.\n\"Follow if you can,\" she whispered to the kandra, then sprang into the\ndarkness after her prey.\nThe Watcher shot away, bounding through the night. Vin had little\nexperience chasing another Mistborn; her only real chance to practice had\ncome during Kelsier's training sessions. She soon found herself struggling\nto keep up with the Watcher, and she felt a stab of guilt for what she had\ndone to OreSeur earlier. She was learning firsthand how difficult it was to\nfollow a determined Mistborn through the mists. And she didn't have the\nadvantage of a dog's sense of smell.\nShe did, however, have tin. It made the night clearer and enhanced her\nhearing. With it, she managed to follow the Watcher as he moved toward\nthe center of the city. Eventually, he let himself drop down toward one of\nthe central fountain squares. Vin fell as well, hitting the slick cobblestones\nwith a flare of pewter, then dodging to the side as he threw out a handful of\ncoins.\nMetal rang against stone in the quiet night, coins plinging against\nstatues and cobblestones. Vin smiled as she landed on all fours; then she\nbounded forward, jumping with pewter-enhanced muscles and Pulling one\nof the coins up into her hand.\nHer opponent leaped backward, landing on the edge of a nearby\nfountain. Vin landed, then dropped her coin, using it to throw herself\nupward over the Watcher's head. He stooped, watching warily as she passed\nover him.\nVin caught of one of the bronze statues at the center of the fountain\nitself and pulled herself to a stop atop it. She crouched on the uneven\nfooting, looking down at her opponent. He stood balanced on one foot at the\nedge of the fountain, quiet and black in the churning mists. There was a. .\n.challenge in his posture."

She\nPushed herself directly toward the Watcher, using the cool bronze as an\nanchor.\nThe Watcher used the statue as well, Pulling himself forward. He shot\njust beneath Vin, throwing up a wave of water, his incredible speed letting\nhim skid like a stone across the fountain's still surface. As he jumped clear\nof the water, he Pushed himself away, shooting across the square.\nVin landed on the fountain lip, chill water spraying across her. She\ngrowled, jumping after the Watcher.\nAs he landed, he spun and whipped out his own daggers. She rolled\nbeneath his first attack, then brought her daggers up in a two-handed double\njab. The Watcher jumped quickly out of the way, his daggers sparkling and\ndropping beads of fountain water. He had a lithe power about him as he\ncame to rest in a crouch. His body looked tense and sure. Capable.\nVin smiled again, breathing quickly. She hadn't felt like this since. .\n.since those nights so long ago, when she'd sparred with Kelsier. She\nremained in a crouch, waiting, watching the mist curl between her and her\nopponent. He was of medium height, had a wiry build, and he wore no\nmistcloak.\nWhy no cloak? Mistcloaks were the ubiquitous mark of her kind, a\nsymbol of pride and security.\nShe was too far away to distinguish his face. She thought she saw a\nhint of a smile, however, as he jumped backward and Pushed against\nanother statue. The chase began again.\nVin followed him through the city, flaring steel, landing on roofs and\nstreets, Pushing herself in great arcing leaps. The two bounded through\nLuthadel like children on a playground—Vin trying to cut off her opponent,\nhe cleverly managing to stay just a little bit ahead of her.\nHe was good. Far better than any Mistborn she had known or faced,\nsave perhaps for Kelsier. However, she'd grown greatly in skill since she'd\nsparred with the Survivor. Could this newcomer be even better? The\nthought thrilled her. She'd always considered Kelsier a paradigm of\nAllomantic ability, and it was easy to forget that he'd had his powers for\nonly a couple of years before the Collapse.\nThat's the same amount of time that I've been training, Vin realized as\nshe landed in a small, cramped street. She frowned, crouching, remaining\nstill. She'd seen the Watcher fall toward this street.\nNarrow and poorly maintained, the street was practically an alleyway,\nlined on both sides by three- and four-story buildings. There was no motion\n—either the Watcher had slipped away or he was hiding nearby. She burned\niron, but the iron-lines revealed no motion.\nHowever, there was another way. . ..\nVin pretended to still be looking around, but she turned on her bronze,\nflaring it, trying to pierce the coppercloud that she thought might be close.\nAnd there he was. Hiding in a room behind the mostly closed shutters"

Now that she knew where to look, she saw the bit of\nmetal he'd probably used to jump up to the second story, the latch he must\nhave Pulled on to quickly close the shutters behind him. He'd probably\nscouted this street beforehand, always intending to lose her here.\nClever, Vin thought.\nHe couldn't have anticipated her ability to pierce copperclouds. But,\nattacking him now might give away that ability. Vin stood quietly, thinking\nof him crouching above, tensely waiting for her to move off.\nShe smiled. Reaching inside, she examined the duralumin reserve.\nThere was a possible way to discover if burning it created some change in\nthe way she looked to another Mistborn. The Watcher was likely burning\nmost of his metals, trying to determine what her next move would be.\nSo, thinking herself incredibly clever, Vin burned the fourteenth metal.\nA massive explosion sounded in her ears. Vin gasped, dropping to her\nknees in shock. Everything grew bright around her, as if some crack of\nenergy had illuminated the entire street. And she felt cold; frigidly,\nstunningly cold.\nShe moaned, trying to make sense of the sound. It. . .it wasn't an\nexplosion, but many explosions. A rhythmic thudding, like a drum pounding\njust beside her. Her heart-beat. And the breeze, loud as a howling wind. The\nscratchings of a dog searching for food. Someone snoring in their sleep. It\nwas as if her hearing had been magnified a hundred times.\nAnd then. . .nothing. Vin fell backward against the cobblestones, the\nsudden rush of light, coldness, and sound evaporating. A form moved in the\nshadows nearby, but she couldn't make it out—she couldn't see in the\ndarkness anymore. Her tin was. . .\nGone, she realized, coming to. My entire store of tin has been burned\naway. I was. . .burning it, when I turned on the duralumin.\nI burned them both at once. That's the secret. The duralumin had\nburned away all her tin in a single, massive burst. It had made her senses\namazingly acute for a very short time, but had stolen away her entire\nreserve. And, looking, she could see that her bronze and her pewter—the\nother metals she'd been burning at the time—were gone as well. The onrush\nof sensory information had been so vast that she hadn't noticed the effects\nof the other two.\nThink about it later, Vin told herself, shaking her head. She felt like\nshe should be deafened and blinded, but she wasn't. She was just a bit\nstunned.\nThe dark form moved up beside her in the mists. She didn't have time\nto recover; she pushed herself to her feet, stumbling. The form, it was too\nshort to be the Watcher. It was. . .\n\"Mistress, do you require assistance?\"\nVin paused as OreSeur padded up to her, then sat on his haunches.\n\"You. . .managed to follow,\" Vin said."

No, no assistance.\" Vin shook her head, clearing her mind. \"I\nguess that's one thing I didn't think of by making you a dog. You can't carry\nmetals for me now.\"\nThe kandra cocked his head, then padded over into an alleyway. He\nreturned a moment later with something in his mouth.

Vin\npicked up the belt, pulling off one of her extra metal vials. \"Thank you,\" she\nsaid slowly. \"That is very. . .thoughtful of you.\"\n\"I fulfill my Contract, Mistress,\" the kandra said. \"Nothing more.\"\nWell, this is more than you've ever done before, she thought, downing a\nvial and feeling her reserves return. She burned tin, restoring her night\nvision, releasing a veil of tension from her mind; since she'd discovered her\npowers, she'd never had to go out at night in complete darkness.\nThe shutters of the Watcher's room were open; he had apparently fled\nduring her fit. Vin sighed.\n\"Mistress!\" OreSeur snapped.\nVin spun. A man landed quietly behind her. He looked. . .familiar, for\nsome reason. He had a lean face—topped with dark hair—and his head was\ncocked slightly in confusion. She could see the question in his eyes. Why\nhad she fallen down?\nVin smiled. \"Maybe I just did it to lure you closer,\" she whispered—\nsoftly, yet loud enough that she knew tin-enhanced ears would hear her.\nThe Mistborn smiled, then tipped his head to her as if in respect.\n\"Who are you?\" Vin asked, stepping forward.\n\"An enemy,\" he replied, holding up a hand to ward her back.\nVin paused. Mist swirled between them on the quiet street. \"Why, then,\ndid you help me fight those assassins?\"\n\"Because,\" he said. \"I'm also insane.\"\nVin frowned, eyeing the man. She had seen insanity before in the eyes\nof beggars. This man was not insane. He stood proudly, eyes controlled as\nhe regarded her in the darkness.\nWhat kind of game is he playing? she wondered.\nHer instincts—a lifetime's worth of instincts—warned her to be wary.\nShe had only just learned to trust her friends, and she wasn't about to offer\nthe same privilege to a man she had met in the night.\nAnd yet, it had been over a year since she'd spoken with another\nMistborn. There were conflicts within her that she couldn't explain to the\nothers. Even Mistings, like Ham and Breeze, couldn't understand the\nstrange dual life of a Mistborn. Part assassin, part bodyguard, part\nnoblewoman. . .part confused, quiet girl.

Even if she couldn't, she certainly\ncouldn't afford to fight him. A spar in the night was one thing, but if their\ncontest grew dangerous, atium might come into play.\nIf that happened, she'd lose.\nThe Watcher studied her with a careful eye. \"Answer something for\nme,\" he said in the mists.\nVin nodded.\n\"Did you really kill Him?\"\n\"Yes,\" Vin whispered. There was only one person he could mean.\nHe nodded slowly. \"Why do you play their games?\"\n\"Whose games?\"\nThe Watcher gestured into the mists, toward Keep Venture.\n\"Those aren't games,\" Vin said. \"It's no game when the people I love\nare in danger.\"\nThe Watcher stood quietly, then shook his head, as if. . .disappointed.\nThen, he pulled something from his sash.\nVin jumped back immediately. The Watcher, however, simply flipped a\ncoin to the ground between them. It bounced a couple of times, coming to a\nrest on the cobbles. Then, the Watcher Pushed himself backward into the\nair.\nVin didn't follow. She reached up, rubbing her head; she still felt like\nshe should have a headache.\n\"You're letting him go?\" OreSeur asked.\nVin nodded. \"We're done for tonight. He fought well.\"\n\"You sound almost respectful,\" the kandra said.\nVin turned, frowning at the hint of disgust in the kandra's voice.\nOreSeur sat patiently, displaying no further emotion.\nShe sighed, tying her belt around her waist. \"We're going to need to\ncome up with a harness or something for you,\" she said. \"I want you to\ncarry extra metal vials for me, like you did as a human.\"\n\"A harness won't be necessary, Mistress,\" OreSeur said.\n\"Oh?\"\nOreSeur rose, padding forward. \"Please get out one of your vials.\"\nVin did as requested, pulling out a small glass vial. OreSeur stopped,\nthen turned one shoulder toward her. As she watched, the fur parted and the\nflesh itself split, showing forth veins and layers of skin. Vin pulled back a\nbit.\n\"There is no need to be worried, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"My flesh is\nnot like your own. I have more. . .control over it, you might say. Place the\nmetal vial inside my shoulder.\"\nVin did as asked. The flesh sealed around the vial, obscuring it from\nview. Experimentally, Vin burned iron. No blue lines appeared pointing\ntoward the hidden vial. Metal inside of a person's stomach couldn't be\naffected by another Allomancer; indeed, metal piercing a body, like\nInquisitor spikes or Vin's own earring, couldn't be Pushed or Pulled by\nsomeone else. Apparently, the same rule applied to metals hidden within a\nkandra.\n\"I will deliver this to you in an emergency,\" OreSeur said.\n\"Thank you,\" Vin said.\n\"The Contract, Mistress.

I met Alendi first in Khlennium; he\nwas a young lad then, and had not yet been warped by a decade spent\nleading armies.\n9\nMARSH HAD CHANGED. THERE WAS something. . .harder about\nthe former Seeker. Something in the way he always seemed to be staring at\nthings Sazed couldn't see, something in his blunt responses and terse\nlanguage.\nOf course, Marsh had always been a straightforward man. Sazed eyed\nhis friend as the two strode down the dusty highway. They had no horses;\neven if Sazed had possessed one, most beasts wouldn't go near an\nInquisitor.\nWhat did Spook say that Marsh's nickname was? Sazed thought to\nhimself as they walked. Before his transformation, they used to call him. .\n.Ironeyes. The name that had turned out to be chillingly prophetic. Most of\nthe others found Marsh's transformed state discomforting, and had left him\nisolated. Though Marsh hadn't seemed to mind the treatment, Sazed had\nmade a special effort to befriend the man.\nHe still didn't know if Marsh appreciated the gesture or not. They did\nseem to get along well; both shared an interest in scholarship and history,\nand both were interested in the religious climate of the Final Empire.\nAnd, he did come looking for me, Sazed thought. Of course, he did\nclaim that he wanted help in case the Inquisitors weren't all gone from the\nConventical of Seran. It was a weak excuse. Despite his powers as a\nFeruchemist, Sazed was no warrior.\n\"You should be in Luthadel,\" Marsh said.\nSazed looked up. Marsh had spoken bluntly, as usual, without\npreamble. \"Why do you say that?\" Sazed asked.\n\"They need you there.\"\n\"The rest of the Final Empire has need of me too, Marsh. I am a\nKeeper—one group of people should not be able to monopolize all of my\ntime.\"\nMarsh shook his head. \"These peasants, they will forget your passing.\nNo one will forget the things that will soon happen in the Central\nDominance.\"\n\"You would be surprised, I think, at what men can forget. Wars and\nkingdoms may seem important now, but even the Final Empire proved\nmortal. Now that it has fallen, the Keepers have no business being involved\nin politics.\" Most would say we never had any business being involved in\npolitics at all.\nMarsh turned toward him. Those eyes, sockets filled entirely with\nsteel. Sazed did not shiver, but he felt distinctly uncomfortable.\n\"And your friends?\" Marsh asked.\nThis touched on something more personal. Sazed looked away,\nthinking of Vin, and of his vow to Kelsier that he would protect her. She\nneeds little protection now, he thought. She's grown more adept at\nAllomancy than even Kelsier was. And yet, Sazed knew that there were\nmodes of protection that didn't relate to fighting. These things—support,\ncounsel, kindness—were vital to every person, and most especially to Vin."

You will return to\nLuthadel once we are finished here.\"\nSazed opened his mouth to argue, but said nothing. What was there to\nsay? Marsh was right. Though he had no proof, Sazed knew that there were\nimportant things happening in Luthadel—things that would require his aid\nto fight. Things that likely affected the future of the entire land once known\nas the Final Empire.\nSo, he closed his mouth and trudged after Marsh. He would return to\nLuthadel, proving himself a rebel once again. Perhaps, in the end, he would\nrealize that there was no ghostly threat facing the world—that he had\nsimply returned because of his own selfish desire to be with his friends.\nIn fact, he hoped that proved to be the truth. The alternative made him\nvery uncomfortable.\nAlendi's height struck me the first time I saw him. Here was a man who\ntowered over others, a man who—despite his youth and his humble clothing\n—demanded respect.\n10\nTHE ASSEMBLY HALL WAS in the former Steel Ministry Canton of\nFinance headquarters. It was a low-ceilinged space, more of a large lecture\nroom than an assembly hall. There were rows of benches fanning out in\nfront of a raised stage. On the right side of the stage, Elend had constructed\na tier of seats for the Assembly members. On the left of the stage, he had\nconstructed a single lectern for speakers.\nThe lectern faced the Assemblymen, not the crowd. The common\npeople were, however, encouraged to attend. Elend thought that everyone\nshould be interested in the workings of their government; it pained him that\nthe Assembly's weekly meetings usually had a small audience.\nVin's seat was on the stage, but at the back, directly opposite the\naudience. From her vantage with the other bodyguards, she would look past\nthe lectern toward the crowd. Another row of Ham's guards—in regular\nclothing—sat in the first row of the audience, providing a first line of\nprotection. Elend had balked at Vin's demands to having guards both in\nfront of the stage and behind it—he thought that bodyguards sitting right\nbehind the speakers would be distracting. Ham and Vin, however, had\ninsisted. If Elend was going to stand up in front of a crowd every week, Vin\nwanted to be certain she could keep a close eye on him—and on those\nwatching him.\nGetting to her chair, therefore, required Vin to walk across the stage.\nStares followed her. Some of the watching crowd were interested in the\nscandal; they assumed that she was Elend's mistress, and a king sleeping\nwith his personal assassin made for good gossip.

Still others were curious\nabout the growing legends; they wondered if a girl like Vin could really\nhave slain the Lord Ruler.\nVin hurried her pace. She passed the Assemblymen and found her seat\nnext to Ham, who—despite the formal occasion—still wore a simple vest\nwith no shirt. Sitting next to him in her trousers and shirt, Vin didn't feel\nquite so out of place.\nHam smiled, clapping her affectionately on the shoulder. She had to\nforce herself not to jump at the touch. It wasn't that she disliked Ham—\nquite the opposite, actually. She loved him as she did all of the former\nmembers of Kelsier's band. It was just that. . .well, she had trouble\nexplaining it, even to herself. Ham's innocent gesture made her want to\nsquirm. It seemed to her that people shouldn't be so casual with the way that\nthey touched others.\nShe pushed those thoughts away. She had to learn to be like other\npeople. Elend deserved a woman who was normal.\nHe was already there. He nodded to Vin as he noticed her arrival, and\nshe smiled. Then he turned back to speaking quietly with Lord Penrod, one\nof the noblemen in the Assembly.\n\"Elend will be happy,\" Vin whispered. \"Place is packed.\"\n\"They're worried,\" Ham said quietly. \"And worried people pay more\nattention to things like this. Can't say I'm happy—all these people make our\njob harder.\"\nVin nodded, scanning the audience. The crowd was a strangely mixed\none—a collection of different groups who would never have met together\nduring the days of the Final Empire. A major part were noblemen, of\ncourse. Vin frowned, thinking of how often various members of the nobility\ntried to manipulate Elend, and of the promises he made to them. . ..\n\"What's that look for?\" Ham asked, nudging her.\nVin eyed the Thug. Expectant eyes twinkled in his firm, rectangular\nface. Ham had an almost supernatural sense when it came to arguments.\nVin sighed. \"I don't know about this, Ham.\"\n\"This?\"\n\"This,\" Vin said quietly, waving her hand at the Assembly. \"Elend tries\nso hard to make everyone happy. He gives so much away—his power, his\nmoney. . ..\"\n\"He just wants to see that everyone is treated fairly.\"\n\"It's more than that, Ham,\" Vin said. \"It's like he's determined to make\neveryone a nobleman.\"\n\"Would that be such a bad thing?\"\n\"If everyone is a nobleman, then there is no such thing as a nobleman.\nEveryone can't be rich, and everyone can't be in charge. That's just not the\nway things work.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Ham said thoughtfully. \"But, doesn't Elend have a civic\nduty to try and make sure justice is served?\"\nCivic duty? Vin thought.

All they do is argue and try to take his\npower away. And he lets them.\"\nHam let the discussion die, and Vin turned back to her study of the\naudience. It appeared that a large group of mill workers had arrived first and\nmanaged to get the best seats. Early in the Assembly's history—perhaps ten\nmonths before—the nobility had sent servants to reserve seats for them, or\nhad bribed people to give up their places. As soon as Elend had discovered\nthis, however, he had forbidden both practices.\nOther than the noblemen and the mill workers, there was a large\nnumber of the \"new\" class. Skaa merchants and craftsmasters, now allowed\nto set their own prices for their services. They were the true winners in\nElend's economy. Beneath the Lord Ruler's oppressive hand, only the few\nmost extraordinarily skilled skaa had been able to rise to positions of even\nmoderate comfort. Without those restrictions, these same people had\nquickly proven to have abilities and acumen far above their noble\ncounterparts'. They represented a faction in the Assembly at least as\npowerful as that of the nobility.\nOther skaa peppered the crowd. They looked much the same as they\nhad before Elend's rise to power. While noblemen generally wore suits—\ncomplete with dayhats and coats—these skaa wore simple trousers. Some of\nthem were still dirty from their day's labor, their clothing old, worn, and\nstained with ash.\nAnd yet. . .there was something different about them. It wasn't in their\nclothing, but their postures. They sat a little straighter, their heads held a\nlittle higher. And they had enough free time to attend an Assembly meeting.\nElend finally stood to begin the meeting. He had let his attendants\ndress him this morning, and the result was attire that was almost completely\nfree of dishevelment. His suit fit well, all the buttons were done up, and his\nvest was of an appropriate dark blue. His hair was even neatly styled, the\nshort, brown curls lying flat.\nNormally, Elend would begin the meeting by calling on other speakers,\nAssemblymen who would drone on for hours about various topics like\ntaxation rates or city sanitation. However, this day, there were more\npressing matters.\n\"Gentlemen,\" Elend said. \"I beg your leave to depart from our usual\nagenda this afternoon, in the light of our current. . .state of city affairs.\"\nThe group of twenty-four Assemblymen nodded, a few muttering\nthings under their breath. Elend ignored them. He was comfortable before\ncrowds, far more comfortable than Vin would ever be. As he unrolled his\nspeech, Vin kept one eye on the crowd, watching for reactions or problems.\n\"The dire nature of our situation should be quite obvious,\" Elend said,\nbeginning the speech he had prepared earlier. \"We face a danger that this\ncity has never known. Invasion and siege from an outside tyrant.\n\"We are a new nation, a kingdom founded on principles unknown\nduring the days of the Lord Ruler. Yet, we are already a kingdom of\ntradition. Freedom for the skaa. Rule by our own choice and of our own"

Rule by our own choice and of our own\ndesign. Noblemen who don't have to cower before the Lord Ruler's\nobligators and Inquisitors.\n\"Gentlemen, one year is not enough. We have tasted freedom, and we\nneed time to savor it. During the last month, we have frequently discussed\nand argued regarding what to do should this day arrive. Obviously, we are\nof many minds on the issue. Therefore, I ask for a vote of solidarity. Let us\npromise ourselves, and these people, that we will not give this city over to a\nforeign power without due consideration. Let us resolve to gather more\ninformation, to seek for other avenues, and even to fight should it be\ndeemed necessary.\"\nThe speech went on, but Vin had heard it a dozen times as Elend\npracticed it. As he spoke, she found herself eying the crowd. She was most\nworried about the obligators she saw sitting in the back. They showed little\nreaction to the negative light in which Elend's remarks cast them.\nShe'd never understood why Elend allowed the Steel Ministry to\ncontinue teaching. It was the last real remnant of the Lord Ruler's power.\nMost obligators obstinately refused to lend their knowledge of bureaucracy\nand administration to Elend's government, and they still regarded skaa with\ncontempt.\nAnd yet, Elend let them remain. He maintained a strict rule that they\nwere not allowed to incite rebellion or violence. However, he also didn't\neject them from the city, as Vin had suggested. Actually, if the choice had\nbeen solely hers, she probably would have executed them.\nEventually, Elend's speech drew to a close, and Vin turned her\nattention back to him. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I make this proposal out of\nfaith, and I make it in the names of those we represent. I ask for time. I\npropose that we forgo all votes regarding the future of the city until a proper\nroyal delegation has been allowed to meet with the army outside and\ndetermine what, if any, opportunity there is for negotiations.\"\nHe lowered his sheet, looking up, waiting for comments.\n\"So,\" said Philen, one of the merchants on the Assembly. \"You're\nasking us to give you the power to decide the city's fate.\" Philen wore his\nrich suit so well that an observer would never have known that he'd first put\none on about a year ago.\n\"What?\" Elend asked. \"I said nothing of the sort—I'm simply asking\nfor more time. To meet with Straff.\"\n\"He's rejected all of our earlier messages,\" said another Assemblyman.\n\"What makes you think he'll listen now?\"\n\"We're approaching this wrong!\" said one of the noble representatives.\n\"We should be resolving to beg Straff Venture not to attack, not resolving to\nmeet with him and chat. We need to establish quickly that we're willing to\nwork with him. You've all seen that army. He's planning to destroy us!\"\n\"Please,\" Elend said, raising a hand. \"Let us stay on topic!\"\nOne of the other Assemblymen—one of the skaa—spoke up, as if he"

We should\nhave hired mercenaries months ago, as I'd suggested.\"\n\"And where would we have gotten the funds for that?\" asked Lord\nPenrod, senior of the noble Assemblymen.\n\"Taxes,\" the merchant said with a wave of his hand.\n\"Gentlemen!\" Elend said; then, louder, \"Gentlemen!\"\nThis garnered him some small measure of attention.\n\"We have to make a decision,\" Elend said. \"Stay focused, if you\nplease. What of my proposal?\"\n\"It's pointless,\" said Philen the merchant. \"Why should we wait? Let's\njust invite Straff into the city and be done. He's going to take it anyway.\"\nVin sat back as the men began to argue again. The problem was, the\nmerchant Philen—as little as she liked him—had a point. Fighting was\nlooking like a very unattractive option. Straff had such a large army. Would\nstalling really do that much good?\n\"Look, see,\" Elend said, trying to get their attention again—and only\npartially succeeding. \"Straff is my father. Maybe I could talk to him. Get\nhim to listen? Luthadel was his home for years. Perhaps I can convince him\nnot to attack it.\"\n\"Wait,\" said one of the skaa representatives. \"What of the food issue?\nHave you seen what the merchants are charging for grain? Before we worry\nabout that army, we should talk about bringing prices down.\"\n\"Always blaming us for your problems,\" one of the merchant\nAssemblymen said, pointing. And the squabbling began again. Elend\nslumped just slightly behind the lectern. Vin shook her head, feeling sorry\nfor Elend as the discussion degenerated. This was what often happened at\nAssembly meetings; it seemed to her that they simply didn't give Elend the\nrespect he deserved. Perhaps that was his own fault, for elevating them to\nhis near equals.\nFinally, the discussion wound down, and Elend got out a piece of\npaper, obviously planning to record the vote on his proposal. He did not\nlook optimistic.\n\"All right,\" Elend said. \"Let's vote. Please remember—giving me time\nwill not play our hand. It will simply give me a chance to try and make my\nfather reconsider his desire to take our city away from us.\"\n\"Elend, lad,\" said Lord Penrod. \"We all lived here during the Lord\nRuler's reign. We all know what kind of man your father is. If he wants this\ncity, he is going to take it. All we can decide, then, is how to best give up.\nPerhaps we can find a way for the people to retain some freedom under his\nrule.\"\nThe group sat quietly, and for the first time nobody brought up a new"

        "text": "Perhaps we can find a way for the people to retain some freedom under his\nrule.\"\nThe group sat quietly, and for the first time nobody brought up a new\nsquabble. A few of them turned toward Penrod, who sat with a calm, in-\ncontrol expression. Vin knew little of the man. He was one of the more\npowerful noblemen who had remained in the city after the Collapse, and he\nwas politically conservative. However, she had never heard him speak\nderogatively of the skaa, which was probably why he was so popular with\nthe people.\n\"I speak bluntly,\" Penrod said, \"for it is the truth. We are not in a\nposition to bargain.\"\n\"I agree with Penrod,\" Philen said, jumping in. \"If Elend wants to meet\nwith Straff Venture, then I guess that's his right. As I understand it, kingship\ngrants him authority to negotiate with foreign monarchs. However, we don't\nhave to promise not to give Straff the city.\"\n\"Master Philen,\" Lord Penrod said. \"I think you misjudged my intent. I\nsaid that giving up the city was inevitable—but that we should try to gain as\nmuch from it as possible. That means at least meeting with Straff to assess\nhis disposition. Voting to give him the city now would be to play our hand\ntoo soon.\"\nElend looked up, looking hopeful for the first time since the discussion\nhad first degenerated. \"So, you support my proposal?\" he asked.\n\"It is an awkward way to achieve the pause I think necessary,\" Penrod\nsaid. \"But. . .seeing as how the army is already here, then I doubt we have\ntime for anything else. So, yes, Your Majesty. I support your proposal.\"\nSeveral other members of the Assembly nodded as Penrod spoke, as if\ngiving the proposal consideration for the first time. That Penrod has too\nmuch power, Vin thought, eyes narrowing as she regarded the elderly\nstatesman. They listen to him more than they do Elend.\n\"Should we vote, then?\" one of the other Assemblymen asked.\nAnd they did. Elend recorded votes as they moved down the line of\nAssemblymen. The eight noblemen—seven plus Elend—voted for the\nproposal, giving Penrod's opinion a great deal of weight. The eight skaa\nwere mostly for it, and the merchants mostly against it. In the end, however,\nElend got the two-thirds vote he needed.\n\"Proposal accepted,\" Elend said, making the final tally, looking a bit\nsurprised. \"The Assembly divests itself of the right to surrender the city\nuntil after the king has met with Straff Venture in official parlay.\"\nVin sat back in her seat, trying to decide what she thought of the vote.\nIt was good that Elend had gotten his way, but the manner in which he'd\nachieved it bothered her.\nElend finally relinquished the lectern, sitting and letting a disgruntled\nPhilen take the lead. The merchant read a proposal calling for a vote to turn\ncontrol of city food stockpiles over to the merchants. However, this time\nElend himself led the dissent, and the arguing began again. Vin watched\nwith interest. Did Elend even realize how much like the others he acted\nwhile he was arguing against their proposals?"

The people in the\naudience stood, stretching, and Ham turned toward her. \"Good meeting,\neh?\"\nVin just shrugged.\nHam chuckled. \"We really have to do something about your\nambivalence toward civic duty, kid.\"\n\"I already overthrew one government,\" Vin said. \"I figure that takes\ncare of my 'civic duty' for a while.\"\nHam smiled, though he kept a wary eye on the crowd—as did Vin.\nNow, with everyone moving about, would be the perfect time for an attempt\non Elend's life. One person in particular caught her attention, and she\nfrowned.\n\"Be back in a few seconds,\" she said to Ham, rising.\n\"You did the right thing, Lord Penrod,\" Elend said, standing beside the\nolder nobleman, whispering quietly as break proceeded. \"We need more\ntime. You know what my father will do to this city if he takes it.\"\nLord Penrod shook his head. \"I didn't do this for you, son. I did it\nbecause I wanted to make certain that fool Philen didn't hand the city over\nbefore the nobility extracted promises from your father about our rights to\ntitle.\"\n\"Now, see,\" Elend said, holding up a finger. \"There has to be another\nway! The Survivor would never have given this city away without a fight.\"\nPenrod frowned, and Elend paused, quietly cursing himself. The old\nlord was a traditionalist—quoting the Survivor at him would have little\npositive effect. Many of the noblemen felt threatened by Kelsier's influence\nwith the skaa.\n\"Just think about it,\" Elend said, glancing to the side as Vin\napproached. She waved him away from the Assemblymen seats, and he\nexcused himself. He crossed the stage, joining her. \"What is it?\" he asked\nquietly.\n\"Woman at the back,\" Vin said quietly, eyes suspicious. \"Tall one, in\nthe blue.\"\nThe woman in question wasn't hard to find; she wore a bright blue\nblouse and colorful red skirt. She was middle-aged, of lean build, and had\nher waist-length hair pulled back in a braid. She waited patiently as people\nmoved about the room.\n\"What about her?\" Elend asked.\n\"Terris,\" Vin said.\nElend paused. \"You're sure?\"\nVin nodded. \"Those colors. . .that much jewelry. She's a Terriswoman\nfor sure.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"So, I've never met her,\" Vin said. \"And she was watching you, just\nnow.\"\n\"People watch me, Vin,\" Elend noted. \"I am the king, after all. Besides,\nwhy should you have met her?\"\n\"All of the other Terris people have come to meet me right after they\nenter the city,\" Vin said. \"I killed the Lord Ruler; they see me as the one that\nfreed their homeland. But, I don't recognize her. She hasn't ever come thank\nme.\"\nElend rolled his eyes, grabbing Vin by the shoulders and turning her"

Now, I happen to find it rather\ncharming, but do you honestly think that a Terriswoman would try to kill\nme?\"\n\"Probably not,\" Vin admitted. \"But, old habits. . .\"\nElend smiled. Then, he glanced back at the Assemblymen, most of\nwhom were speaking quietly in groups. They didn't mix. Noblemen spoke\nwith noblemen, merchants with merchants, skaa workers with other skaa\nworkers. They seemed so fragmented, so obstinate. The simplest proposals\nsometimes met with arguments that could take hours.\nThey need to give me more time! he thought. Yet, even as he thought,\nhe realized the problem. More time for what? Penrod and Philen had\naccurately attacked his proposal.\nThe truth was, the entire city was in over its head. Nobody really knew\nwhat to do about a superior invading force, least of all Elend. He just knew\nthat they couldn't give up. Not yet. There had to be a way to fight.\nVin was still looking to the side, out over the audience. Elend followed\nher gaze. \"Still watching that Terriswoman?\"\nVin shook her head. \"Something else. . .something odd. Is that one of\nClubs's messengers?\"\nElend paused, turning. Indeed, several soldiers were working their way\nthrough the crowd, approaching the stage. At the back of the room, people\nhad begun whispering and shuffling, and some were already moving\nquickly out of the chamber.\nElend felt Vin stiffen in anxiety, and fear stabbed him. We're too late.\nThe army has attacked.\nOne of the soldiers finally reached the stage, and Elend rushed over.\n\"What?\" he asked. \"Has Straff attacked?\"\nThe soldier frowned, looking concerned. \"No, my lord.\"\nElend sighed slightly. \"What, then?\"\n\"My lord, it's a second army. It just arrived outside the city.\"\nOddly, it was Alendi's simple ingenuousness that first led me to\nbefriend him. I employed him as an assistant during his first months in the\ngrand city.\n11\nFOR THE SECOND TIME IN two days, Elend stood atop the\nLuthadel city wall, studying an army that had come to invade his kingdom.\nElend squinted against the red afternoon sunlight, but he was no Tineye; he\ncouldn't make out details about the new arrival.\n\"Any chance they're here to help us?\" Elend asked hopefully, looking\ntoward Clubs, who stood beside him."

Remember him? Guy who\nsent eight Allomancer assassins to kill you two days back?\"\nElend shivered in the chill autumn weather, glancing back out over the\nsecond army. It was making camp a good distance from Straff's army, close\nto the Luth-Davn Canal, which ran out the west side of the River Channerel.\nVin stood at Elend's side, though Ham was off organizing things among the\ncity guard. OreSeur, wearing the wolfhound's body, sat patiently on the wall\nwalk beneath Vin.\n\"How did we miss their approach?\" Elend asked.\n\"Straff,\" Clubs said. \"This Cett came in from the same direction, and\nour scouts were focused on him. Straff probably knew about this other army\na few days ago, but we had virtually no chance of seeing them.\"\nElend nodded.\n\"Straff is setting up a perimeter of soldiers, watching the enemy army,\"\nVin said. \"I doubt they're friendly to each other.\" She stood atop one of the\nsawtooth parapet crenels, feet positioned dangerously close to the wall's\nedge.\n\"Maybe they'll attack each other,\" Elend said hopefully.\nClubs snorted. \"I doubt it. They're too evenly matched, though Straff\nmight be a little stronger. I doubt Cett would take the chance by attacking\nhim.\"\n\"Why come, then?\" Elend asked.\nClubs shrugged. \"Maybe he hoped he'd beat Venture to Luthadel, and\nget to take it first.\"\nHe spoke of the event—the capture of Luthadel—as if it were a given.\nElend's stomach twisted as he leaned against the battlement, looking out\nthrough a merlon. Vin and the others were thieves and skaa Allomancers—\noutcasts who had been hunted for most of their lives. Perhaps they were\naccustomed to dealing with this pressure—this fear—but Elend was not.\nHow did they live with the lack of control, the sense of inevitability?\nElend felt powerless. What could he do? Flee, and leave the city to fend for\nitself? That, of course, was not an option. But, confronted with not one, but\ntwo armies preparing to destroy his city and take his throne, Elend found it\nhard to keep his hands steady as he gripped the rough stone of the\nbattlement.\nKelsier would have found a way out of this, he thought.\n\"There!\" Vin's voice interrupted Elend's thoughts. \"What's that?\"\nElend turned. Vin was squinting, looking toward Cett's army, using tin\nto see things that were invisible to Elend's mundane eyes.\n\"Someone's leaving the army,\" Vin said. \"Riding on horseback.\"\n\"Messenger?\" Clubs asked.\n\"Maybe,\" Vin said. \"He's riding pretty fast. . ..\" She began to run from\none stone tooth to the next, moving along the wall.

Or, at least, Elend assumed that was what she watched\n—he still couldn't see what she had.\nAllomancy, Elend thought, shaking his head. Why couldn't he have at\nleast ended up with one power—even one of the weaker ones, like copper\nor iron?\nVin cursed suddenly, standing up straight. \"Elend, that's Breeze!\"\n\"What!\" Elend said. \"Are you sure?\"\n\"Yes! He's being chased. Archers on horseback.\"\nClubs cursed, waving to a messenger. \"Send riders! Cut off his\npursuit!\"\nThe messenger dashed away. Vin, however, shook her head. \"They\nwon't make it in time,\" she said, almost to herself. \"The archers will catch\nhim, or at least shoot him. Even I couldn't get there fast enough, not\nrunning.

She had a reserve, but she\ndidn't burn it—not yet. I hope this works, she thought, seeking an\nappropriate anchor. The tower beside her had a reinforced iron bulwark on\nthe top—that would work.\nShe Pulled on the bulwark, yanking herself up to the top of the tower.\nShe immediately jumped again, Pushing herself up and out, angling into the\nair away from the wall. She extinguished all of her metals except for steel\nand pewter.\nThen, still Pushing against the bulwark, she burned duralumin.\nA sudden force smashed against her. It was so powerful, she was\ncertain that only an equally powerful flash of pewter held her body together.\nShe blasted away from the keep, hurtling through the sky as if tossed by\nsome giant, invisible god. The air rushed by so quickly that it roared, and\nthe pressure of sudden acceleration made it difficult to think.\nShe floundered, trying to regain control. She had, fortunately, picked\nher trajectory well: she was shooting right toward Breeze and his pursuers.\nWhatever Breeze had done, it had been enough to make someone extremely\nangry—for there were a full two dozen men charging after him, arrows\nnocked.\nVin fell, her steel and pewter completely burned away in that single\nduralumin-fueled flash of power. She grabbed a metal vial off her belt,\ndowning its contents. However, as she tossed the vial away, she suddenly\nfelt an odd sense of vertigo. She wasn't accustomed to jumping during the\nday. It was strange to see the ground coming at her, strange not to have a\nmistcloak flapping behind her, strange not to have the mist. . ..\nThe lead rider lowered his bow, taking sight at Breeze.

She Pushed against the coin,\nusing it to slow her momentum and to nudge her to the side. She hit right\nbetween Breeze and the archers, landing with a jarring crash, throwing up\ndust and dirt.\nThe archer released his arrow.\nEven as Vin rebounded, dirt spraying around her, she reached out and\nPushed herself back into the air straight at the arrow. Then she Pushed\nagainst it. The arrowhead ripped backward—throwing out shards of wood\nas it split its own shaft in midair—then smacked directly into the forehead\nof the archer who had released it.\nThe man toppled from his mount. Vin landed from her rebound. She\nreached out, Pushing against the horseshoes of the two beasts behind the\nleader, causing the animals to stumble. The Push threw Vin backward into\nthe air, and cries of equine pain sounded amid the crash of bodies hitting the\nground.\nVin continued to Push, flying along the road just a few feet above the\nground, quickly catching up with Breeze. The portly man turned in shock,\nobviously stunned to find Vin hanging in the air beside his galloping horse,\nher clothing flapping in the wind of her passage. She winked at him, then\nreached out and Pulled against the armor of another rider.\nShe immediately lurched in the air. Her body protested the sudden shift\nin momentum, but she ignored the twist of pain. The man she Pulled against\nmanaged to stay in his saddle—until Vin smashed into him feet-first,\nthrowing him backward.\nShe landed on the black earth, the rider tumbling to the ground beside\nher. A short distance away, the remaining riders finally reined in their\nmounts, coming to an abrupt stop a few feet away.\nKelsier probably would have attacked. There were a lot of them, true,\nbut they were wearing armor and their horses were shod. Vin, however, was\nnot Kelsier. She had delayed the riders long enough for Breeze to get away.\nThat was enough.\nVin reached out and Pushed against one of the soldiers, throwing\nherself backward, leaving the riders to gather their wounded. The soldiers,\nhowever, promptly pulled out stone-tipped arrows and nocked their bows.\nVin hissed in frustration as the group took sight. Well, friends, she\nthought, I suggest that you hang on tightly.\nShe Pushed slightly against them all, then burned duralumin. The\nsudden crash of force was expected—the wrench in her chest, the massive\nflare in her stomach, the howling wind. What she didn't expect was the\neffect she'd have on her anchors. The blast of power scattered men and\nhorses, throwing them into the air like leaves in the wind.\nI'm going to have to be very careful with this, Vin thought, gritting her\nteeth and spinning herself in the air.

I do hate to force a rescue—but, well, if one is\nnecessary, then it might as well happen with style.\"\nVin smiled as he climbed down from the horse—proving he was\nhardly the most adroit man in the square—and stablehands arrived to care\nfor the beast. Breeze wiped his brow again as Elend, Clubs, and OreSeur\nscrambled down the steps to the courtyard. One of the aides must have\nfinally found Ham, for he ran up through the courtyard.\n\"Breeze!\" Elend said, approaching and clasping arms with the shorter\nman.\n\"Your Majesty,\" Breeze said. \"You are in good health and good humor,\nI assume?\"\n\"Health, yes,\" Elend said. \"Humor. . .well, there is an army crouching\njust outside my city.\"\n\"Two armies, actually,\" Clubs grumbled as he hobbled up.\nBreeze folded up his handkerchief. \"Ah, and dear Master Cladent.\nOptimistic as always, I see.\"\nClubs snorted. To the side, OreSeur padded up to sit next to Vin.\n\"And Hammond,\" Breeze said, eyeing Ham, who was smiling broadly.\n\"I'd almost managed to delude myself into forgetting that you would be here\nwhen I returned.\"\n\"Admit it,\" Ham said. \"You're glad to see me.\""

Hear you, never. I had grown quite fond of my time\nspent away from your perpetual, pseudo-philosophical pratterings.\"\nHam just smiled a little broader.\n\"I'm glad to see you, Breeze,\" Elend said. \"But your timing could have\nbeen a little better. I was hoping that you would be able to stop some of\nthese armies from marching on us.\"\n\"Stop them?\" Breeze asked. \"Now, why would I want to do that, my\ndear man? I did, after all, just spend three months working to get Cett to\nmarch his army down here.\"\nElend paused, and Vin frowned to herself, standing just outside the\ngroup. Breeze looked rather pleased with himself—though that was,\nadmittedly, rather common for him.\n\"So. . .Lord Cett's on our side?\" Elend asked hopefully.\n\"Of course not,\" Breeze said. \"He's here to ravage the city and steal\nyour presumed atium supply.\"\n\"You,\" Vin said. \"You're the one who has been spreading the rumors\nabout the Lord Ruler's atium stash, aren't you?\"\n\"Of course,\" Breeze said, eyeing Spook as the boy finally arrived at the\ngates.\nElend frowned. \"But. . .why?\"\n\"Look outside your walls, my dear man,\" Breeze said. \"I knew that\nyour father was going to march on Luthadel eventually—even my powers of\npersuasion wouldn't have been enough to dissuade him. So, I began\nspreading rumors in the Western Dominance, then made myself one of Lord\nCett's advisors.\"\nClubs grunted. \"Good plan. Crazy, but good.\"\n\"Crazy?\" Breeze said. \"My mental stability is no issue here, Clubs. The\nmove was not crazy, but brilliant.\"\nElend looked confused. \"Not to insult your brilliance, Breeze. But. .\n.how exactly is bringing a hostile army to our city a good idea?\"\n\"It's basic negotiating strategy, my good man,\" Breeze explained as a\npackman handed him his dueling cane, taken off the horse. Breeze used it to\ngesture westward, toward Lord Cett's army. \"When there are only two\nparticipants in a negotiation, one is generally stronger than the other. That\nmakes things very difficult for the weaker party—which, in this case, would\nhave been us.\"\n\"Yes,\" Elend said, \"but with three armies, we're still the weakest.\"\n\"Ah,\" Breeze said, holding up the cane, \"but those other two parties are\nfairly even in strength. Straff is likely stronger, but Cett has a very large\nforce. If either of those warlords risks attacking Luthadel, his army will\nsuffer losses—enough losses that he won't be able to defend himself from\nthe third army. To attack us is to expose oneself.\"\n\"And that makes this a standoff,\" Clubs said.\n\"Exactly,\" Breeze said. \"Trust me, Elend my boy.

In a\nthree-way negotiation, the weakest party actually has the most power—\nbecause his allegiance added to either of the other two will choose the\neventual winner.\"\nElend frowned. \"Breeze, we don't want to give our allegiance to either\nof these men.\"\n\"I realize that,\" Breeze said. \"However, our opponents do not. By\nbringing a second army in, I've given us time to think. Both warlords\nthought they could get here first. Now that they've arrived at the same time,\nthey'll have to reevaluate. I'm guessing we'll end up in an extended siege. A\ncouple of months at least.\"\n\"That doesn't explain how we're going to get rid of them,\" Elend said.\nBreeze shrugged. \"I got them here—you get to decide what to do with\nthem. And I'll tell you, it was no easy task to make Cett arrive on time. He\nwas due to come in a full five days before Venture. Fortunately, a certain. .\n.malady spread through camp a few days ago. Apparently, someone\npoisoned the main water supply and gave the entire camp diarrhea.\"\nSpook, standing behind Clubs, snickered.\n\"Yes,\" Breeze said, eyeing the boy. \"I thought you might appreciate\nthat. You still an unintelligible nuisance, boy?\"\n\"Wassing the where of not,\" Spook said, smiling and slipping back into\nhis Eastern street slang.\nBreeze snorted. \"You still make more sense than Hammond, half the\ntime,\" he mumbled, turning to Elend. \"So, isn't anyone going to send for a\ncarriage to drive me back to the palace? I've been Soothing you ungrateful\nlot for the better part of five minutes—looking as tired and pathetic as I can\n—and not one of you has had the good graces to pity me!\"\n\"You must be losing your touch,\" Vin said with a smile. Breeze was a\nSoother—an Allomancer who could burn brass to calm another person's\nemotions. A very skilled Soother—and Vin knew of none more skilled than\nBreeze—could dampen all of a person's emotions but a single one,\neffectively making them feel exactly as he wanted.\n\"Actually,\" Elend said, turning and looking back up at the wall, \"I was\nhoping we could go back up on the wall and study the armies some more. If\nyou spent time with Lord Cett's force, then you could probably tell us a lot\nabout it.\"\n\"I can; I will; I am not going to climb those steps. Can't you see how\ntired I am, man?\"\nHam snorted, clapping Breeze on the shoulder—and throwing up a\npuff of dust. \"How can you be tired? Your poor horse did all the running.\"\n\"It was emotionally exhausting, Hammond,\" Breeze said, rapping the\nlarger man's hand with his cane. \"My departure was somewhat\ndisagreeable.\"\n\"What happened, anyway?\" Vin asked. \"Did Cett find out you were a\nspy?\"\nBreeze looked embarrassed. \"Let's just say that Lord Cett and I had a. .\n.falling-out.\""

Breeze was anything but a ladies' man. Despite his\nability to play with emotions, he had expressed no interest in romance for as\nlong as Vin had known him. Dockson had once noted that Breeze was just\ntoo focused on himself to consider such things.\nBreeze simply rolled his eyes at Ham's comment. \"Honestly,\nHammond. I think your jokes are getting worse as you age. One too many\nhits on the head while sparring, I suspect.\"\nHam smiled, and Elend sent for a couple of carriages. While they\nwaited, Breeze launched into a narrative of his travels. Vin glanced down at\nOreSeur. She still hadn't found a good opportunity to tell the rest of the\ncrew about the body change. Perhaps now that Breeze was back, Elend\nwould hold a conference with his inner circle. That would be a good time.\nShe had to be quiet about it, since she wanted the palace staff to think that\nshe'd sent OreSeur away.\nBreeze continued his story, and Vin looked back at him, smiling. Not\nonly was Breeze a natural orator, but he had a very subtle touch with\nAllomancy. She could barely feel his fingers on her emotions. Once, she\nhad found his intrusions offensive, but she was growing to understand that\ntouching people's emotions was simply part of who Breeze was. Just as a\nbeautiful woman demanded attention by virtue of her face and figure,\nBreeze drew it by near unconscious use of his powers.\nOf course, that didn't make him any less a scoundrel. Getting others to\ndo as he wished was one of Breeze's main occupations. Vin just no longer\nresented him for using Allomancy to do it.\nThe carriage finally approached, and Breeze sighed in relief. As the\nvehicle pulled up, he eyed Vin, then nodded toward OreSeur. \"What's that?\"\n\"A dog,\" Vin said.\n\"Ah, blunt as ever, I see,\" Breeze said. \"And, why is it that you now\nhave a dog?\"\n\"I gave it to her,\" Elend said. \"She wanted one, so I bought it for her.\"\n\"And you chose a wolfhound?\" Ham asked, amused.\n\"You've fought with her before, Ham,\" Elend said, laughing. \"What\nwould you have given her? A poodle?\"\nHam chuckled. \"No, I guess not. It fits, actually.\"\n\"Though it's almost as big as she is,\" Clubs added, regarding her with a\nsquinty-eyed look.\nVin reached down, resting her hand on OreSeur's head. Clubs did have\na point; she'd chosen a big animal, even for a wolfhound. He stood over\nthree feet tall at the shoulder—and Vin knew from experience how heavy\nthat body was.\n\"Remarkably well-behaved for a wolfhound,\" Ham said, nodding.\n\"You chose well, El.\"\n\"Regardless,\" Breeze said. \"Can we please return to the palace?\nArmies and wolfhounds are all well and good, but I believe supper is more"

The three of them had\ntaken a carriage of their own, leaving the other four to follow in the other\nvehicle.\nVin shrugged. OreSeur sat on the seat across from her and Elend,\nquietly watching the conversation. \"I'll tell them eventually,\" Vin said. \"A\nbusy city square didn't seem the right place for the revelation.\"\nElend smiled. \"Keeping secrets is a hard habit to break, eh?\"\nVin flushed. \"I'm not keeping him secret, I'm just. . .\" She trailed off,\nlooking down.\n\"Don't feel bad, Vin,\" Elend said. \"You lived a long time on your own,\nwithout anyone to trust. Nobody expects you to change overnight.\"\n\"It hasn't been one night, Elend,\" she said. \"It's been two years.\"\nElend laid a hand on her knee. \"You're getting better. The others talk\nabout how much you've changed.\"\nVin nodded. Another man would be afraid that I'm keeping secrets\nfrom him, too. Elend just tries to make me feel less guilty. He was a better\nman than she deserved.\n\"Kandra,\" Elend said, \"Vin says you do well at keeping up with her.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" OreSeur said. \"These bones, though distasteful,\nare well equipped for tracking and quick movement.\"\n\"And if she gets hurt?\" Elend said. \"Will you be able to pull her to\nsafety?\"\n\"Not with any speed, Your Majesty. I will, however, be able to go for\naid. These bones have many limitations, but I will do my best to fulfill the\nContract.\"\nElend must have caught Vin's raised eyebrow, for he chuckled. \"He'll\ndo as he says, Vin.\"\n\"The Contract is everything, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"It demands\nmore than simple service. It requires diligence and devotion. It is the\nkandra. By serving it, we serve our people.\"\nVin shrugged. The group fell silent, Elend pulling a book from his\npocket, Vin leaning against him. OreSeur lay down, filling the entire seat\nopposite the humans. Eventually, the carriage rolled into the Venture\ncourtyard, and Vin found herself looking forward to a warm bath. As they\nwere climbing from the carriage, however, a guard rushed up to Elend. Tin\nallowed Vin to hear what the man said, even though he spoke before she\ncould close the distance.\n\"Your Majesty,\" the guard whispered, \"our messenger reached you,\nthen?\"\n\"No,\" Elend said with a frown as Vin walked over. The soldier gave\nher a look, but continued speaking; the soldiers all knew that Vin was\nElend's primary bodyguard and confidant. Still, the man looked oddly\nconcerned when he saw her.\n\"We. . .ah, don't want to be intrusive,\" the soldier said. \"That's why\nwe've kept this quiet. We were just wondering if. . .everything is all right.\"\nHe looked at Vin as he spoke."

One completely picked clean,\nwithout a hint of blood—or even tissue—marring its shiny white surfaces.\nA good number of the bones were broken, however.\n\"I'm sorry, Mistress,\" OreSeur said, speaking low enough that only she\ncould hear. \"I assumed that you were going to dispose of these.\"\nVin nodded. The skeleton was, of course, the one OreSeur had been\nusing before she gave him the animal body. Finding the door unlocked—\nVin's usual sign that she wanted a room cleaned—the maids had entered.\nVin had stashed the bones in a basket, intending to deal with them later.\nApparently, the maids had decided to check and see what was in the basket,\nand been somewhat surprised.\n\"It's all right, Captain,\" Elend said to the young guard—Captain\nDemoux, second-in-command of the palace guard. Despite the fact that\nHam shunned uniforms, this man seemed to take great pride in keeping his\nown uniform very neat and smart.\n\"You did well by keeping this quiet,\" Elend said. \"We knew about\nthese bones already. They aren't a reason for concern.\"\nDemoux nodded. \"We figured it was something intentional.\" He didn't\nlook at Vin as he spoke.\nIntentional, Vin thought. Great. I wonder what this man thinks I did.\nFew skaa knew what kandra were, and Demoux wouldn't know what to\nmake of remains like these.\n\"Could you dispose of these quietly for me, Captain?\" Elend asked,\nnodding to the bones.\n\"Of course, Your Majesty,\" the guard said.\nHe probably assumes I ate the person or something, Vin thought with a\nsigh. Sucked the flesh right off his bones.\nWhich, actually, wasn't that far from the truth.\n\"Your Majesty,\" Demoux said. \"Would you like us to dispose of the\nother body as well?\"\nVin froze.\n\"Other one?\" Elend asked slowly.\nThe guard nodded. \"When we found this skeleton, we brought in some\ndogs to sniff about. The dogs didn't turn up any killers, but they did find\nanother body. Just like this one—a set of bones, completely cleaned of\nflesh.\"\nVin and Elend shared a look. \"Show us,\" Elend said.\nDemoux nodded, and led them out of the room, giving a few\nwhispered orders to one of his men. The four of them—three humans and\none kandra—traveled a short distance down the palace hallway, toward a\nless used section of visitors' chambers. Demoux dismissed a soldier\nstanding at a particular door, then led them inside.\n\"This body wasn't in a basket, Your Majesty,\" Demoux said. \"It was\nstuffed in a back closet. We'd probably never have found it without the dogs\n—they picked up the scent pretty easily, though I can't see how. These\ncorpses are completely clean of flesh.\"\nAnd there it was.

But he sounded hesitant. He\npadded over, sniffing at the bones. Vin picked one up herself, holding it to\nher nose. With tin, she easily picked out a sharp scent that reminded her of\nbile.\n\"It's very strong,\" she said, glancing at OreSeur.\nHe nodded. \"These bones haven't been here long, Your Majesty. A few\nhours at most. Perhaps even less.\"\n\"Which means we have another kandra somewhere in the palace,\"\nElend said, looking a bit sick. \"One of my staff has been. . .eaten and\nreplaced.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" OreSeur said. \"There is no way to tell from these\nbones whom it could be, since these are the discards. The kandra would\nhave taken the new bones, eating their flesh and wearing their clothing.\"\nElend nodded, standing. He met Vin's eyes, and she knew he was\nthinking the same thing she was. It was possible that a member of the\npalace staff had been replaced, which would mean a slight breach in\nsecurity. There was a far more dangerous possibility, however.\nKandra were incomparable actors; OreSeur had imitated Lord Renoux\nso perfectly that even people who'd known him had been fooled. Such talent\ncould have been used for the imitation of a maid or a servant. However, if\nan enemy had wanted to get a spy into Elend's closed meetings, he would\nneed to replace a person far more important.\nIt would be someone that we haven't seen during the last few hours,\nVin thought, dropping the bone. She, Elend, and OreSeur had been on the\nwall for most of the afternoon and evening—ever since the end of the\nAssembly meeting—but the city and palace had been in chaos since the\nsecond army had arrived. The messengers had had trouble finding Ham, and\nshe still wasn't certain where Dockson was. In fact, she hadn't seen Clubs\nuntil he'd joined her and Elend on the wall just a bit before.

The steep-\nsided, craterlike valley was so wide that even in daylight Sazed would\nbarely have been able to see the other side. In the oncoming darkness,\nobscured by mist, the far edge of the massive hole was only a deep shadow.\nSazed knew very little about tactics and strategy; though his\nmetalminds held dozens of books on the subjects, he had forgotten their\ncontents in order to create the stored records. The little he did know told\nhim that this fortress—the Conventical of Seran—was not very defensible.\nIt relinquished the high ground, and the crater sides would provide an\nexcellent location for siege engines to pelt rocks down at the walls.\nThis fortress, however, had not been built to defend against enemy\nsoldiers. It had been built to provide solitude. The crater made it difficult to\nfind, for a slight rise in the land around the crater's lip made it practically\ninvisible until one drew near. No roads or paths marked the way, and\ntravelers would have great trouble getting down the sheer sides.\nThe Inquisitors did not want visitors.\n\"Well?\" Marsh asked.\nHe and Sazed stood on the crater's northern lip, before a drop of\nseveral hundred feet. Sazed tapped his vision tinmind, drawing forth some\nof the eyesight he had stored within it. The edges of his vision fuzzed, but\nthings directly in front of him seemed to grow much closer. He tapped a\nlittle more sight, ignoring the nausea that came from compounding so much\nvision.\nThe increased eyesight let him study the Conventical as if he stood\nbefore it. He could see each notch in the dark stone walls—flat, broad,\nimposing. He could discern each bit of rust on the large steel plates that\nhung bolted into outside stones of the wall. He could see each lichen-\nencrusted corner and ash-stained ledge. There were no windows.\n\"I do not know,\" Sazed said slowly, releasing his vision tinmind. \"It is\nnot easy to say whether or not the fortress is inhabited. There is no motion,\nnor is there light. But, perhaps the Inquisitors are just hiding inside.\"\n\"No,\" Marsh said, his stiff voice uncomfortably loud in the evening air.\n\"They are gone.\"\n\"Why would they leave? This is a place of great strength, I think. Poor\ndefense against an army, but a great defense against the chaos of the times.\"\nMarsh shook his head. \"They are gone.\"\n\"How are you so certain?\"\n\"I do not know.\""

I do not know if they will\nreturn, but we should exploit this opportunity.\"\nSazed nodded. This was why they had come, after all. Still, a part of\nhim hesitated. He was a man of books and genteel service. Traveling the\ncountryside to visit villages was enough removed from his experience to be\ndiscomforting. Infiltrating the Inquisitor stronghold. . .\nMarsh obviously didn't care about his companion's inner struggles. The\nInquisitor turned and began to walk along the rim of the crater. Sazed threw\nhis pack over his shoulder, then followed. They eventually arrived at a\ncage-like contraption, obviously meant to be lowered down to the bottom\nby ropes and pulleys. The cage sat locked in place at the top ledge, and\nMarsh stopped at its side, but did not enter.\n\"What?\" Sazed asked.\n\"The pulley system,\" Marsh said. \"The cage is meant to be lowered by\nmen holding it from below.\"\nSazed nodded, realizing this was true. Marsh stepped forward and\nthrew a lever. The cage fell. Ropes began to smoke, and pulleys squealed as\nthe massive cage plummeted toward the chasm floor. A muted crash echoed\nagainst the rocks.\nIf there is anyone down there, Sazed thought, they now know we're\nhere.\nMarsh turned toward him, the heads of his eye-spikes glistening\nslightly in the failing sunlight. \"Follow however you wish,\" he said. Then,\nhe tied off the counterrope and began to climb down the ropes.\nSazed stepped up to the platform's edge, watching Marsh shimmy\ndown the dangling rope into the shadowed, misty abyss. Then, Sazed knelt\nand opened his pack. He unhooked the large metal bracers around his upper\nand lower arms—his core copperminds. They contained the memories of a\nKeeper, the stored knowledge of centuries past. He reverently placed them\nto the side, then pulled a pair of much smaller bracelets—one iron, one\npewter—from the pack. Metalminds for a warrior.\nDid Marsh understand how unskilled Sazed was in this area? Amazing\nstrength did not a warrior make. Regardless, Sazed snapped the two\nbracelets around his ankles. Next, he pulled out two rings—tin and copper.\nThese he slipped on his fingers.\nHe closed the pack and threw it over his shoulder, then picked up his\ncore copperminds. He carefully located a good hiding place—a secluded\nhollow between two boulders—and slid them inside. Whatever happened\nbelow, he didn't want to risk them being taken and destroyed by the\nInquisitors.\nIn order to fill a coppermind with memories, Sazed had listened to\nanother Keeper recite his entire collection of histories, facts, and stories.\nSazed had memorized each sentence, then shoved those memories into the\ncoppermind for later retrieval.

Sazed remembered very little of the actual\nexperience—but he could draw forth any of the books or essays he wished,\nplacing them back into his mind, gaining the ability to recollect them as\ncrisply as when he'd first memorized them. He just had to have the bracers\non.\nBeing without his copperminds made him anxious. He shook his head,\nwalking back over to the platform. Marsh was moving very quickly down\ntoward the chasm floor; like all Inquisitors, he had the powers of a\nMistborn. Though how he had gotten those powers—and how he managed\nto live despite the spikes that had been driven directly through his brain—\nwas a mystery. Marsh had never answered Sazed's questions on the subject.\nSazed called down, drawing Marsh's attention, then held up his pack\nand dropped it. Marsh reached out, and the pack lurched, Pulled by its\nmetals into Marsh's hand. The Inquisitor threw it over his shoulder before\ncontinuing his descent.\nSazed nodded thankfully, then stepped off the platform. As he began to\nfall, he mentally reached into his ironmind, searching for the power he had\nstored therein. Filling a metalmind always had a cost: in order to store up\nsight, Sazed had been forced to spend weeks with poor eyesight. During\nthat time, he had worn a tin bracelet, stowing away the excess sight for later\nuse.\nIron was a bit different from the others. It didn't store up sight,\nstrength, endurance—or even memories. It stored something completely\ndifferent: weight.\nThis day, Sazed didn't tap the power stored inside the ironmind; that\nwould have made him more heavy. Instead, he began to fill the ironmind,\nletting it suck away his weight. He felt a familiar sense of lightness—a\nsense that his own body wasn't pressing upon itself as forcefully.\nHis fall slowed. The Terris philosophers had much to say on using an\nironmind. They explained that the power didn't actually change a person's\nbulk or size—it just somehow changed the way that the ground pulled\nagainst them. Sazed's fall didn't slow because of his decrease in weight—it\nslowed because he suddenly had a relatively large amount of surface\nexposed to the wind of his fall, and a lighter body to go along with it.\nRegardless of the scientific reasons, Sazed didn't fall as quickly. The\nthin metal bracelets on his legs were the heaviest things on his body, and\nthey kept him pointed feet-downward. He held out his arms and bent his\nbody slightly, letting the wind push against him. His descent was not\nterribly slow—not like that of a leaf or a feather. However, he didn't\nplummet either. Instead, he fell in a controlled—almost leisurely—manner.\nClothing flapping, arms outspread, he passed Marsh, who watched with a\ncurious expression.\nAs he approached the ground, Sazed tapped his pewtermind, drawing\nforth a tiny bit of strength to prepare. He hit the ground—but, because his\nbody was so light, there was very little shock. He barely even needed to\nbend his knees to absorb the force of impact."

He barely even needed to\nbend his knees to absorb the force of impact.\nHe stopped filling the ironmind, released his pewter, and waited\nquietly for Marsh. Beside him, the carrying cage lay in shambles. Sazed\nnoticed several broken iron shackles with discomfort. Apparently, some of\nthose who had visited the Conventical had not come by choice.\nBy the time Marsh neared the bottom, the mists were thick in the air.\nSazed had lived with them all of his life, and had never before felt\nuncomfortable in them. Yet, now he half expected the mists to begin\nchoking him. To kill him, as they seemed to have done to old Jed, the\nunfortunate farmer whose death Sazed had investigated.\nMarsh dropped the last ten feet or so, landing with an Allomancer's\nincreased agility. Even after spending so much time with Mistborn, Sazed\nwas impressed with Allomancy's gifts. Of course, he'd never been jealous of\nthem—not really. True, Allomancy was better in a fight; but it could not\nexpand the mind, giving one access to the dreams, hopes, and beliefs of a\nthousand years of culture. It could not give the knowledge to treat a wound,\nor help teach a poor village to use modern fertilization techniques. The\nmetalminds of Feruchemy weren't flamboyant, but they had a far more\nlasting value to society.\nBesides, Sazed knew a few tricks with Feruchemy that were bound to\nsurprise even the most prepared warrior.\nMarsh handed him the pack. \"Come.\"\nSazed nodded, shouldering the pack and following the Inquisitor\nacross the rocky ground. Walking next to Marsh was odd, for Sazed wasn't\naccustomed to being around people who were as tall as he was. Terrismen\nwere tall by nature, and Sazed even more so: his arms and legs were a bit\ntoo long for his body, a medical condition brought on by his having been\ncastrated as a very young boy. Though the Lord Ruler was dead, Terris\nculture would long feel the effects of his stewardship and breeding\nprograms—the methods by which he had tried to breed Feruchemical\npowers out of the Terris people.\nThe Conventical of Seran loomed in the darkness, looking even more\nominous now that Sazed stood within the crater. Marsh strode right up to\nthe front doors, and Sazed followed behind. He wasn't afraid, not really.\nFear had never been a strong motivator in Sazed's life. However, he did\nworry. There were so few Keepers left; if he died, that was one fewer\nperson who could travel, restoring lost truths and teaching the people.\nNot that I'm doing such at the moment anyway. . ..\nMarsh regarded the massive steel doors. Then he threw his weight\nagainst one, obviously burning pewter to enhance his strength. Sazed joined\nhim, pushing hard. The door did not budge.\nRegretting the expenditure of power, Sazed reached into his\npewtermind and tapped strength. He used far more than he had when\nlanding, and his muscles immediately increased in size. Unlike Allomancy,"

He used far more than he had when\nlanding, and his muscles immediately increased in size. Unlike Allomancy,\nFeruchemy often had direct effects on a person's body. Beneath his robes,\nSazed gained the bulk and build of a lifetime warrior, easily becoming twice\nas strong as he had been a moment earlier. With their combined effort, the\ntwo of them managed to push the door open.\nIt did not creak. It slid slowly, but evenly, inward, exposing a long,\ndark hallway.\nSazed released his pewtermind, reverting to his normal self. Marsh\nstrode into the Conventical, his feet kicking up the mist that had begun to\npour through the open doorway.\n\"Marsh?\" Sazed asked.\nThe Inquisitor turned.\n\"I won't be able to see inside there.\"\n\"Your Feruchemy. . .\"\nSazed shook his head. \"It can let me see better in darkness, but only if\nthere's some light to begin with. In addition, tapping that much sight would\ndrain my tinmind in a matter of minutes. I'll need a lantern.\"\nMarsh paused, then nodded. He turned into the darkness, quickly\ndisappearing from Sazed's view.\nSo, Sazed thought, Inquisitors don't need light to see. It was to be\nexpected: the spikes filled Marsh's entire sockets, completely destroying the\neyeballs. Whatever strange power allowed Inquisitors to see, it apparently\nworked just as well in pure darkness as it did in daylight.\nMarsh returned a few moments later, carrying a lamp. From the chains\nSazed had seen on the descent cage, Sazed suspected that the Inquisitors\nhad kept a sizable group of slaves and servants to attend their needs. If that\nwas the case, where had the people gone? Had they fled?\nSazed lit the lamp with a flint from his pack. The lamp's ghostly light\nilluminated a stark, daunting hallway. He stepped into the Conventical,\nholding the lamp high, and began to fill the small copper ring on his finger,\nthe process transforming it into a coppermind.\n\"Large rooms,\" he whispered, \"without adornment.\" He didn't really\nneed to say the words, but he'd found that speaking helped him form\ndistinct memories. He could then place them into the coppermind.\n\"The Inquisitors, obviously, had a fondness for steel,\" he continued.\n\"This is not surprising, considering that their religion was often referred to\nas the Steel Ministry. The walls are hung with massive steel plates, which\nbear no rust, unlike the ones outside. Many of those here are not completely\nsmooth, but instead crafted with some interesting patterns etched. . .almost\nbuffed. . .into their surfaces.\"\nMarsh frowned, turning toward him. \"What are you doing?\"\nSazed held up his right hand, showing the copper ring. \"I must make\nan account of this visit. I will need to repeat this experience back to other\nKeepers when the opportunity presents itself. There is much to be learned\nfrom this place, I think.\"\nMarsh turned away. \"You should not care about the Inquisitors. They\nare not worthy of your record.\"\n\"It isn't a matter of worthiness, Marsh,\" Sazed said, holding up his"

They\nare not worthy of your record.\"\n\"It isn't a matter of worthiness, Marsh,\" Sazed said, holding up his\nlamp to study a square pillar. \"Knowledge of all religions is valuable. I must\nmake certain these things persist.\"\nSazed regarded the pillar for a moment, then closed his eyes and\nformed an image of it inside his head, which he then added to the\ncoppermind. Visual memories, however, were less useful than spoken\nwords. Visualizations faded very quickly once taken out of a coppermind,\nsuffering from the mind's distortion. Plus, they could not be passed to other\nKeepers.\nMarsh didn't respond to Sazed's comment about religion; he just turned\nand walked deeper into the building. Sazed followed at a slower pace,\nspeaking to himself, recording the words in his coppermind. It was an\ninteresting experience. As soon as he spoke, he felt the thoughts sucked\nfrom his mind, leaving behind a blank hollowness. He had difficulty\nremembering the specifics of what he had just been saying. However, once\nhe was done filling his coppermind, he would be able to tap those memories\nlater and know them with crisp clarity.\n\"The room is tall,\" he said. \"There are a few pillars, and they are also\nwrapped in steel. They are blocky and square, rather than round. I get a\nsense that this place was created by a people who cared little for subtlety.\nThey ignored small details in favor of broad lines and full geometries.\n\"As we move beyond the main entryway, this architectural theme\ncontinues. There are no paintings on the walls, nor are there wooden\nadornments or tile floors. Instead, there are only the long, broad hallways\nwith their harsh lines and reflective surfaces. The floor is constructed of\nsteel squares, each a few feet across. They are. . .cold to the touch.\n\"It is strange not to see the tapestries, stained-glass windows, and\nsculpted stones that are so common in Luthadel's architecture. There are no\nspires or vaultings here. Just squares and rectangles. Lines. . .so many lines.\nNothing here is soft. No carpet, no rugs, no windows. It is a place for\npeople who see the world differently from ordinary men.\n\"Marsh walked straight down this massive hallway, as if oblivious to\nits decor. I will follow him, then come back to record more later. He seems\nto be following something. . .something I cannot sense. Perhaps it is. . .\"\nSazed trailed off as he stepped around a bend and saw Marsh standing\nin the doorway of a large chamber. The lamplight flickered unevenly as\nSazed's arm quivered.\nMarsh had found the servants.\nThey had been dead long enough that Sazed hadn't noticed the scent\nuntil he had come close. Perhaps that was what Marsh had been following;\nthe senses of a man burning tin could be quite acute.\nThe Inquisitors had done their work thoroughly. These were the\nremnants of a slaughter. The room was large, but had only one exit, and the\nbodies were piled high near the back, killed by what looked like harsh\nsword or axe strokes. The servants had huddled up against the back wall as\nthey died.\nSazed turned away."

The servants had huddled up against the back wall as\nthey died.\nSazed turned away.\nMarsh, however, remained in the doorway. \"There is a bad air about\nthis place,\" he finally said.\n\"You have only just noticed that?\" Sazed asked.\nMarsh turned, glancing at him, demanding his gaze. \"We should not\nspend much time here. There are stairs at the end of the hallway behind us. I\nwill go up—that is where the Inquisitors' quarters will be. If the information\nI seek is here, I will find it there. You may stay, or you may descend.\nHowever, do not follow me.\"\nSazed frowned. \"Why?\"\n\"I must be alone here. I cannot explain it. I do not care if you witness\nInquisitor atrocities. I just. . .do not wish to be with you when you do.\"\nSazed lowered his lamp, turning its light away from the horrific scene.\n\"Very well.\"\nMarsh turned, brushing past Sazed and disappearing into the dark\nhallway. And Sazed was alone.\nHe tried not to think about that very much. He returned to the main\nhallway, describing the slaughter to his coppermind before giving a more\ndetailed explanation of the architecture and the art—if, indeed, that was\nwhat the different patterns on the wall plates could be called.\nAs he worked—his voice echoing quietly against the rigid architecture,\nhis lamp a weak drop of light reflected in steel—his eyes were drawn\ntoward the back of the hallway. There was a pool of darkness there. A\nstairwell, leading down.\nEven as he turned back to his description of one of the wall mounts, he\nknew that he would eventually find himself walking toward that darkness. It\nwas the same as ever—the curiosity, the need to understand the unknown.\nThis sense had driven him as a Keeper, had led him to Kelsier's company.\nHis search for truths could never be completed, but neither could it be\nignored. So, he eventually turned and approached the stairwell, his own\nwhispering voice his only companion.\n\"The stairs are akin to what I saw in the hallway. They are broad and\nexpansive, like the steps leading up to a temple or palace. Except, these go\ndown, into darkness. They are large, likely cut from stone and then lined\nwith steel. They are tall, meant for a determined stride.\n\"As I walk, I wonder what secrets the Inquisitors deemed worthy of\nhiding below the earth, in the basement of their stronghold. This entire\nbuilding is a secret. What did they do here, in these massive hallways and\nopen, empty rooms?\n\"The stairwell ends in another large, square room. I've noticed\nsomething—there are no doors in the doorways here. Each room is open,\nvisible to those outside. As I walk, peeking into the rooms beneath the\nearth, I find cavernous chambers with few furnishings. No libraries, no\nlounges. Several contain large metal blocks that could be altars.\n\"There is. . .something different here in this last room, at the back of\nthe main landing. I'm not certain what to make of it.

These other\nones. . .yes, they look indistinguishable from the ones in Marsh's eyes. Yet,\nsome are of different metals.\"\nSazed set the spike down on a table, metal clinking against metal. He\nshivered, scanning the room again. A place to make new Inquisitors,\nperhaps? He had a sudden horrific vision of the creatures—once only\nseveral dozen in number—having swelled their ranks during their months\nsequestered in the Conventical.\nBut that didn't seem right. They were a secretive, exclusive bunch.\nWhere would they have found enough men worthy of joining their ranks?\nWhy not make Inquisitors from the servants above, rather than just killing\nthem?\nSazed had always suspected that a man had to be an Allomancer to be\nchanged into an Inquisitor. Marsh's own experience substantiated that\npremise: Marsh had been a Seeker, a man who could burn bronze, before\nhis transformation. Sazed looked again at the blood, the spikes, and the\ntables, and decided he wasn't certain that he wanted to know how one made\na new Inquisitor.\nSazed was about to leave the room when his lamp revealed something\nat the back. Another doorway.\nHe moved forward, trying to ignore the dried blood at his feet, and\nentered a chamber that didn't seem to match the rest of the Conventical's\ndaunting architecture. It was cut directly into the stone, and it twisted down\ninto a very small stairwell. Curious, Sazed walked down the set of worn\nstone steps. For the first time since entering the building, he felt cramped,\nand he had to stoop as he reached the bottom of the stairwell and entered a\nsmall chamber. He stood up straight, and held up his lamp to reveal. . .\nA wall. The room ended abruptly, and his light sparkled off the wall. It\nheld a steel plate, like those above. This one was a good five feet across,\nand nearly as tall. And it bore writing. Suddenly interested, Sazed set down\nhis pack and stepped forward, raising his lamp to read the top words on the\nwall.\nThe text was in Terris.\nIt was an old dialect, certainly, but one that Sazed could make out even\nwithout his language coppermind. His hand trembled as he read the words.\nI write these words in steel, for anything not set in metal cannot be\ntrusted.\nI have begun to wonder if I am the only sane man remaining. Can the\nothers not see?

Marsh stood in the doorway\nbehind him. Imperious, discomforting, and so dark. He fit this place, with\nits lines and hardness.\n\"The upstairs quarters are empty,\" Marsh said. \"This trip has been a\nwaste—my brethren took anything of use with them.\"\n\"Not a waste, Marsh,\" Sazed said, turning back to the plate of text. He\nhadn't read all of it; he hadn't even gotten close. The script was written in a\ntight, cramped hand, its etchings coating the wall. The steel had preserved\nthe words despite their obvious age. Sazed's heart beat a little faster.\nThis was a fragment of text from before the Lord Ruler's reign. A\nfragment written by a Terris philosopher—a holy man. Despite ten centuries\nof searching, the Keepers had never fulfilled the original goal of their\ncreation: they had never discovered their own Terris religion.\nThe Lord Ruler had squelched Terris religious teachings soon after his\nrise to power. His persecution of the Terris people—his own people—had\nbeen the most complete of his long reign, and the Keepers had never found\nmore than vague fragments regarding what their own people had once\nbelieved.\n\"I have to copy this down, Marsh,\" Sazed said, reaching for his pack.\nTaking a visual memory wouldn't work—no man could stare at a wall of so\nmuch text, then remember the words. He could, perhaps, read them into his\ncoppermind. However, he wanted a physical record, one that perfectly\npreserved the structure of lines and punctuation.\nMarsh shook his head. \"We will not stay here. I do not think we should\neven have come.\"\nSazed paused, looking up. Then he pulled several large sheets of paper\nfrom his pack. \"Very well, then,\" he said. \"I'll take a rubbing. That will be\nbetter anyway, I think. It will let me see the text exactly as it was written.\"\nMarsh nodded, and Sazed got out his charcoal.\nThis discovery. . .he thought with excitement. This will be like\nRashek's logbook. We are getting close!\nHowever, even as he began the rubbing—his hands moving carefully\nand precisely—another thought occurred to him. With a text like this in his\npossession, his sense of duty would no longer let him wander the villages.\nHe had to return to the north to share what he had found, lest he die and this\ntext be lost.

Perhaps the mists are simply like\nother weather patterns—they vary, sometimes.\"\n\"Doesn't it even seem a little strange to you?\"\n\"I will think it strange if you wish me to, Mistress,\" OreSeur said.\n\"That isn't what I meant.\"\n\"I apologize, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"Tell me what you do mean, and\nI will be certain to believe as commanded.\"\nVin sighed, rubbing her brow. I wish Sazed were back. . .she thought. It\nwas an idle wish, however. Even if Sazed were in Luthadel, he wouldn't be\nher steward. The Terrismen no longer called any man master. She'd have to\nmake do with OreSeur.

How can I tell\nhim from other people?\"\nOreSeur sat quietly in the mists.\n\"There has to be a way,\" Vin said. \"His imitation can't be perfect.\nWould cutting him work?\"\nOreSeur shook his head. \"Kandra replicate a body perfectly, Mistress\n—blood, flesh, skin, and muscle. You have seen that when I split my skin.\"\nVin sighed, standing and stepping up on the tip of the peaked rooftop.\nThe mists were already full, and the night was quickly becoming black.

And yes, I\ncommand you to speak.\"\nA flash of triumph shone in OreSeur's eyes, as if he enjoyed forcing\nher into her role. \"Kandra cannot be affected by mental Allomancy,\nMistress.\"\nVin frowned. \"Not at all?\"\n\"No, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"You can try to Riot or Soothe our\nemotions, if you wish, but it will have no effect. We won't even know that\nyou are trying to manipulate us.\"\nLike someone who is burning copper. \"That's not exactly the most\nuseful bit of information,\" she said, strolling past the kandra on the roof.\nAllomancers couldn't read minds or emotions; when they Soothed or Rioted\nanother person, they simply had to hope that the person reacted as intended.\nShe could \"test\" for a kandra by Soothing someone's emotions,\nperhaps. If they didn't react, that might mean they were a kandra—but it\ncould also just mean that they were good at containing their emotions.\nOreSeur watched her pacing. \"If it were easy to detect kandra,\nMistress, then we wouldn't be worth much as impostors, would we?\"\n\"I suppose not,\" Vin acknowledged. However, thinking about what\nhe'd said made her consider something else. \"Can a kandra use Allomancy?\nIf they eat an Allomancer, I mean?\"\nOreSeur shook his head.\nThat's another method, then, Vin thought. If I catch a member of the\ncrew burning metals, then I know he's not the kandra. Wouldn't help with\nDockson or the palace servants, but it would let her eliminate Ham and\nSpook."

Why was that?\"\nOreSeur looked away. \"This is not a thing we speak of.\"\n\"Then I command you to speak of it.\"\n\"Then I must refuse to answer,\" OreSeur said.\n\"Refuse to answer?\" Vin asked. \"You can do that?\"\nOreSeur nodded. \"We are not required to reveal secrets about kandra\nnature, Mistress. It is—\"\n\"In the Contract,\" Vin finished, frowning. I really need to read that\nthing again.\n\"Yes, Mistress. I have, perhaps, said too much already.\"\nVin turned away from OreSeur, looking out over the city. The mists\ncontinued to spin. Vin closed her eyes, questing out with bronze, trying to\nfeel the telltale pulse of an Allomancer burning metals nearby.\nOreSeur rose and padded over beside her, then settled down on his\nhaunches again, sitting on the inclined roof. \"Shouldn't you be at the\nmeeting the king is having, Mistress?\"\n\"Perhaps later,\" Vin said, opening her eyes. Out beyond the city,\nwatchfires from the armies lit the horizon. Keep Venture blazed in the night\nto her right, and inside of it, Elend was holding council with the others.\nMany of the most important men in the government, sitting together in one\nroom. Elend would call her paranoid for insisting that she be the one who\nwatched for spies and assassins. That was fine; he could call her whatever\nhe wanted, as long as he stayed alive.\nShe settled back down. She was glad Elend had decided to pick Keep\nVenture as his palace, rather than moving into Kredik Shaw, the Lord\nRuler's home. Not only was Kredik Shaw too big to be properly defended,\nbut it also reminded her of him. The Lord Ruler.\nShe thought of the Lord Ruler often, lately—or, rather, she thought of\nRashek, the man who had become the Lord Ruler. A Terrisman by birth,\nRashek had killed the man who should have taken the power at the Well of\nAscension and. . .\nAnd done what? They still didn't know. The Hero had been on a quest\nto protect the people from a danger simply known as the Deepness. So\nmuch had been lost; so much had been intentionally destroyed. Their best\nsource of information about those days came in the form of an aged journal,\nwritten by the Hero of Ages during the days before Rashek had killed him.\nHowever, it gave precious few clues about his quest.\nWhy do I even worry about these things? Vin thought. The Deepness is\na thing a thousand years forgotten. Elend and the others are right to be\nconcerned about more pressing events.\nAnd still, Vin found herself strangely detached from them. Perhaps that\nwas why she found herself scouting outside.

By killing me, you have doomed yourselves.\nThose were the Lord Ruler's last words, spoken as he lay dying on the floor\nof his own throne room. They worried her. Chilled her, even still.\nShe needed to distract herself. \"What kinds of things do you like,\nkandra?\" she asked, turning to the creature, who still sat on the rooftop\nbeside her. \"What are your loves, your hatreds?\"\n\"I do not want to answer that.\"\nVin frowned. \"Do not want to, or do not have to?\"\nOreSeur paused. \"Do not want to, Mistress.\" The implication was\nobvious. You're going to have to command me.\nShe almost did. However, something gave her pause, something in\nthose eyes—inhuman though they were. Something familiar.\nShe'd known resentment like that. She'd felt it often during her youth,\nwhen she'd served crewleaders who had lorded over their followers. In the\ncrews, one did what one was commanded—especially if one was a small\nwaif of a girl, without rank or means of intimidation.\n\"If you don't wish to speak of it,\" Vin said, turning away from the\nkandra, \"then I won't force you.\"\nOreSeur was silent.\nVin breathed in the mist, its cool wetness tickling her throat and lungs.\n\"Do you know what I love, kandra?\"\n\"No, Mistress.\"\n\"The mists,\" she said, holding out her arms. \"The power, the freedom.\"\nOreSeur nodded slowly. Nearby, Vin felt a faint pulsing with her\nbronze. Quiet, strange, unnerving. It was the same odd pulsing that she had\nfelt atop Keep Venture a few nights before. She had never been brave\nenough to investigate it again.\nIt's time to do something about that, she decided. \"Do you know what I\nhate, kandra?\" she whispered, falling to a crouch, checking her knives and\nmetals.\n\"No, Mistress.\"\nShe turned, meeting OreSeur's eyes. \"I hate being afraid.\"\nShe knew that others thought her jumpy. Paranoid. She had lived with\nfear for so long that she had once seen it as something natural, like the ash,\nthe sun, or the ground itself.\nKelsier had taken that fear away. She was careful, still, but she didn't\nfeel a constant sense of terror. The Survivor had given her a life where the\nones she loved didn't beat her, had shown her something better than fear.\nTrust. Now that she knew of these things, she would not quickly surrender\nthem. Not to armies, not to assassins. . .\nNot even to spirits.\n\"Follow if you can,\" she whispered, then dropped off the rooftop to the\nstreet below.\nShe dashed along the mist-slicked street, building momentum before\nshe had time to lose her nerve.

The source of the bronze pulses was close; it\ncame from only one street over, in a building. Not the top, she decided. One\nof the darkened windows on the third floor, the shutters open.\nVin dropped a coin and jumped into the air. She shot upward, angling\nherself by Pushing against a latch across the street. She landed in the\nwindow's pitlike opening, arms grabbing the sides of the frame. She flared\ntin, letting her eyes adjust to the deep darkness within the abandoned room.\nAnd it was there. Formed entirely of mists, it shifted and spun, its\noutline vague in the dark chamber. It had a vantage to see the rooftop where\nVin and OreSeur had been talking.\nGhosts don't spy on people. . .do they? Skaa didn't speak of things like\nspirits or the dead. It smacked too much of religion, and religion was for the\nnobility. To worship was death for skaa. That hadn't stopped some, of\ncourse—but thieves like Vin had been too pragmatic for such things.\nThere was only one thing in skaa lore that this creature matched.\nMistwraiths. Creatures said to steal the souls of men foolish enough to go\noutside at night. But, Vin now knew what mistwraiths were. They were\ncousins to the kandra—strange, semi-intelligent beasts who used the bones\nof those they ingested. They were odd, true—but hardly phantoms, and not\nreally even that dangerous. There were no dark wraiths in the night, no\nhaunting spirits or ghouls.\nOr so Kelsier had said. The thing standing in the dark room—its\ninsubstantial form writhing in the mists—seemed a powerful\ncounterexample. She gripped the sides of the window, fear—her old friend\n—returning.\nRun. Flee. Hide.\n\"Why have you been watching me?\" she demanded.\nThe thing did not move. Its form seemed to draw the mists forward,\nand they spun slightly, as if in an air current.\nI can sense it with bronze. That means it's using Allomancy—and\nAllomancy attracts the mist.\nThe thing stepped forward. Vin tensed.\nAnd then the spirit was gone.\nVin paused, frowning. That was it? She had—\nSomething grabbed her arm. Something cold, something terrible, but\nsomething very real. A pain shot through her head, moving as if from her\near and into her mind. She yelled, but cut off as her voice failed. With a\nquiet groan—her arm quivering and shaking—she fell backward out of the\nwindow.\nHer arm was still cold. She could feel it whipping in the air beside her,\nseeming to exude chill air. Mist passed like trailing clouds.\nVin flared tin. Pain, cold, wetness, and lucidity burst into her mind, and\nshe threw herself into a twist and flared pewter just as she hit the ground.\n\"Mistress?\" OreSeur said, darting from the shadows.\nVin shook her head, pushing herself up to her knees, her palms cool\nagainst the slick cobblestones. She could still feel the trailing chill in her\nleft arm."

She looked\nupward, through swirling mists, toward the black window above.\nShe shivered. Her shoulder was sore from where she had hit the\nground, and her still bruised side throbbed, but she could feel her strength\nreturning. She stepped away from the building, still looking up. Above her,\nthe deep mists seemed. . .ominous. Obscuring.\nNo, she thought forcefully. The mists are my freedom; the night is my\nhome! This is where I belong. I haven't needed to be afraid in the night\nsince Kelsier taught me otherwise.\nShe couldn't lose that. She wouldn't go back to the fear. Still, she\ncouldn't help the quick urgency in her step as she waved to OreSeur and\nscampered away from the building. She gave no explanation for her strange\nactions.\nHe didn't ask for one.\nElend set a third pile of books onto the table, and it slumped against\nthe other two, threatening to topple the entire lot to the floor. He steadied\nthem, then glanced up.\nBreeze, in a prim suit, regarded the table with amusement as he sipped\nhis wine. Ham and Spook were playing a game of stones as they waited for\nthe meeting to begin; Spook was winning. Dockson sat in the corner of the\nroom, scribbling on a ledger, and Clubs sat in a deep plush chair, eyeing\nElend with one of his stares.\nAny of these men could be an impostor, Elend thought. The thought\nstill seemed insane to him. What was he to do? Exclude them all from his\nconfidence? No, he needed them too much.\nThe only option was to act normally and watch them. Vin had told him\nto try and spot inconsistencies in their personalities. He intended to do his\nbest, but the reality was he wasn't sure how much he would be able to see.\nThis was more Vin's area of expertise. He needed to worry about the armies.\nThinking of her, he glanced at the stained-glass window at the back of\nthe study, and was surprised to see it was dark.\nThat late already? Elend thought.\n\"My dear man,\" Breeze noted. \"When you told us you needed to 'go\nand gather a few important references,' you might have warned us that you\nwere planning to be gone for two full hours.\"\n\"Yes, well,\" Elend said, \"I kind of lost track of time. . ..\"\n\"For two hours?\"\nElend nodded sheepishly. \"There were books involved.\"\nBreeze shook his head. \"If the fate of the Central Dominance weren't at\nstake—and if it weren't so fantastically enjoyable to watch Hammond lose\nan entire month's earnings to the boy there—I'd have left an hour ago.\"\n\"Yes, well, we can get started now,\" Elend said.\nHam chuckled, standing up. \"Actually, it's kind of like the old days.\nKell always arrived late, too—and he liked to hold his meetings at night.\nMistborn hours.\"\nSpook smiled, his coin pouch bulging."

Even his handwriting\nis legendary. \"Regardless,\" he said, \"I think perhaps we should get to work.\nWe've still got two armies waiting out there.

Well, I guess I did leave them alone for\na couple of hours. \"Let me hear it, then.\"\nDockson stood, pulling his chair a bit closer to join the rest of the\ngroup, and Ham began to speak.\n\"Here's the thing, El,\" Ham said. \"With two armies here, we don't have\nto worry about an immediate attack. But, we're still in serious danger. This\nwill probably turn into an extended siege as each army tries to outlast the\nother.\"\n\"They'll try to starve us out,\" Clubs said. \"Weaken us, and their\nenemies, before attacking.\"\n\"And,\" Ham continued, \"that puts us in a bind—because we can't last\nvery long. The city is already on the edge of starvation—and the enemy\nkings are probably aware of that fact.\"\n\"What are you saying?\" Elend asked slowly.\n\"We have to make an alliance with one of those armies, Your Majesty,\"\nDockson said. \"They both know it. Alone, they can't reliably defeat one\nanother. With our help, however, the balance will be tipped.\"\n\"They'll hem us in,\" Ham said. \"Keep us blockaded until we get\ndesperate enough to side with one of them. Eventually, we'll have to do so\n—either that, or let our people starve.\"\n\"The decision comes down to this,\" Breeze said. \"We can't outlast the\nothers, so we have to choose which of those men we want to take over the\ncity. And, I would suggest making our decision quickly as opposed to\nwaiting while our supplies run out.\"\nElend stood quietly. \"By making a deal with one of those armies, we'll\nessentially be giving away our kingdom.\"\n\"True,\" Breeze said, tapping the side of his cup. \"However, what I\ngained us by bringing a second army is bargaining power. You see, at least\nwe are in a position to demand something in exchange for our kingdom.\"\n\"What good is that?\" Elend asked. \"We still lose.\"\n\"It's better than nothing,\" Breeze said. \"I think that we might be able to\npersuade Cett to leave you as a provisional leader in Luthadel. He doesn't\nlike the Central Dominance; he finds it barren and flat.\""

You wouldn't be king, but you—and\nour armies—would live through the next few months, and Luthadel\nwouldn't be pillaged.\"\nHam, Breeze, and Dockson all sat resolutely, looking him in the eye.\nElend glanced down at his pile of books, thinking of his research and study.\nWorthless. How long had the crew known that there was only one course of\naction?\nThe crew seemed to take Elend's silence as assent.\n\"Cett really is the best choice, then?\" Dockson asked. \"Perhaps Straff\nwould be more likely to make an agreement with Elend—they are, after all,\nfamily.\"\nOh, he'd make an agreement, Elend thought. And he'd break it the\nmoment it was convenient. But. . .the alternative? Give the city over to this\nCett? What would happen to this land, this people, if he were in charge?\n\"Cett is best, I think,\" Breeze said. \"He is very willing to let others\nrule, as long as he gets his glory and his coins. The problem is going to be\nthat atium. Cett thinks it is here, and if he doesn't find it. . .\"\n\"We just let him search the city,\" Ham said.\nBreeze nodded. \"You'd have to persuade him that I misled him about\nthe atium—and that shouldn't be too hard, considering what he thinks of\nme. Which is another small matter—you'll have to convince him that I've\nbeen dealt with. Perhaps he'd believe that I was executed as soon as Elend\nfound out I had raised an army against him.\"\nThe others nodded.\n\"Breeze?\" Elend asked. \"How does Lord Cett treat the skaa in his\nlands?\"\nBreeze paused, then glanced away. \"Not well, I'm afraid.\"\n\"Now, see,\" Elend said. \"I think we need to consider how to best\nprotect our people. I mean, if we give everything over to Cett, then we'd\nsave my skin—but at the cost of the entire skaa population of the\ndominance!\"\nDockson shook his head. \"Elend, it's not a betrayal. Not if this is the\nonly way.\"\n\"That's easy to say,\" Elend said. \"But I'm the one who'd have to bear\nthe guilty conscience for doing such a thing. I'm not saying that we should\nthrow out your suggestion, but I do have a few ideas that we might talk\nabout. . ..\"\nThe others shared looks. As usual, Clubs and Spook remained quiet\nduring proceedings; Clubs only spoke when he felt it absolutely necessary,\nand Spook tended to stay on the periphery of the conversations. Finally,\nBreeze, Ham, and Dockson looked back at Elend.\n\"This is your country, Your Majesty,\" Dockson said carefully. \"We're\nsimply here to give advice.\" Very good advice, his tone implied."

I guess that's what we get for a thousand years without any wars.\nHowever, this book does mention how much grain it took to keep the\nvarious garrisons in the Final Empire stocked. Do you have any idea how\nmuch food an army needs?\"\n\"You have a point,\" Clubs said, nodding. \"Usually, it's a blasted pain to\nkeep soldiers fed; we often had supply problems fighting on the frontier,\nand we were only small bands, sent to quell the occasional rebellion.\"\nElend nodded. Clubs didn't often speak of his past fighting in the Lord\nRuler's army—and the crew didn't often ask him about it.\n\"Anyway,\" Elend said, \"I'll bet both Cett and my father are\nunaccustomed to moving large bodies of men. There will be supply\nproblems, especially for Cett, since he marched so hastily.\"\n\"Maybe not,\" Clubs said. \"Both armies have secured canal routes into\nLuthadel. That will make it easy for them to send for more supplies.\"\n\"Plus,\" Breeze added, \"though much of Cett's land is in revolt right\nnow, he does still hold the city of Haverfrex, which held one of the Lord\nRuler's main canneries. Cett has a remarkable amount of food a short canal\ntrip away.\"\n\"Then, we disrupt the canals,\" Elend said. \"We find a way to stop those\nsupplies from coming. Canals make resupply quick, but also vulnerable,\nsince we know exactly which route it will take. And, if we can take away\ntheir food, perhaps they'll be forced to turn around and march home.\"\n\"Either that,\" Breeze said, \"or they'll just decide to risk attacking\nLuthadel.\"\nElend paused. \"That's a possibility,\" he said. \"But, well, I've been\nresearching how to hold the city as well.\" He reached across the table,\npicking up a book. \"Now, this is Jendellah's City Management in the\nModern Era. He mentions how difficult Luthadel is to police because of its\nextreme size and large number of skaa slums. He suggests using roving\nbands of city watchmen.

Spook paused, then\nsighed, rising to fetch the wine bottle.\n\"Well, yes,\" Elend said. \"But, while there aren't a lot of books on\nwarfare, there are a lot about politics.

I'm not going to throw away\nthose dreams at the first sign of opposition.\"\n\"What about the Assembly?\" Ham said.\n\"That's the best part,\" Elend said. \"They voted in my proposal at the\nmeeting two days back. They can't open the city gates to any invader until I\nmeet with my father in parlay.\"\nThe crew sat quietly for a few moments. Finally, Ham turned to Elend,\nshaking his head. \"I really don't know, El. It sounds appealing. We actually\ndiscussed a few more daring plans like this while we were waiting for you.\nBut. . .\"\n\"But what?\" Elend asked.\n\"A plan like this depends a lot on you, my dear man,\" Breeze said,\nsipping his wine. \"You'd have to be the one to meet with the kings—the one\nto persuade them both that we're on their side. No offense, but you're new to\nscamming. It's difficult to agree to a daring plan that puts a newcomer in as\nthe linchpin member of the team.\"\n\"I can do this,\" Elend said. \"Really.\"\nHam glanced at Breeze, then both glanced at Clubs. The gnarled\ngeneral shrugged. \"If the kid wants to try it, then let him.\"\nHam sighed, then looked back. \"I guess I agree. As long as you're up to\nthis, El.\"\n\"I think I am,\" Elend said, covering his nervousness. \"I just know we\ncan't give up, not easily. Maybe this won't work—maybe, after a couple\nmonths of being besieged, we'll just end up giving away the city anyway.\nHowever, that gives us a couple of months during which something could\nhappen. It's worth the risk to wait, rather than fold. Wait, and plan.\"\n\"All right, then,\" Dockson said. \"Give us some time to come up with\nsome ideas and options, Your Majesty. We'll meet again in a few days to\ntalk about specifics.\"\n\"All right,\" Elend said. \"Sounds good. Now, if we can move on to\nother matters, I'd like to mention—\"\nA knock came at the door. At Elend's call, Captain Demoux pushed\nopen the door, looking a little embarrassed. \"Your Majesty?\" he said. \"I\napologize, but. . .I think we caught someone listening in on your meeting.\"\n\"What?\" Elend said. \"Who?\"\nDemoux turned to the side, waving in a pair of his guards. The woman\nthey led into the room was vaguely familiar to Elend. Tall, like most Terris,\nshe wore a bright-colored, but utilitarian, dress. Her ears were stretched\ndownward, the lobes elongated to accommodate numerous earrings.\n\"I recognize you,\" Elend said. \"From the Assembly hall a few days\nago.

Elend had\nnever actually met a Terriswoman before; he'd only met stewards, eunuchs\ntrained from birth to work as manservants. For some reason, Elend had\nexpected a Terriswoman to seem a bit more servile.\n\"She was hiding in the next room over,\" Demoux said. \"I'm sorry, Your\nMajesty. I don't know how she got past us. We found her listening against\nthe wall, though I doubt she heard anything. I mean, those walls are made\nof stone.\"\nElend met the woman's eyes. Older—perhaps fifty—she wasn't\nbeautiful, but neither was she homely. She was sturdy, with a\nstraightforward, rectangular face. Her stare was calm and firm, and it made\nElend uncomfortable to hold it for long.\n\"So, what did you expect to overhear, woman?\" Elend asked.\nThe Terriswoman ignored the comment. She turned to the others, and\nspoke in a lightly accented voice. \"I would speak with the king alone. The\nrest of you are excused.\"\nHam smiled. \"Well, at least she's got nerve.\"\nDockson addressed the Terriswoman. \"What makes you think that we\nwould leave our king alone with you?\"\n\"His Majesty and I have things to discuss,\" the woman said in a\nbusinesslike manner, as if oblivious of—or unconcerned about—her status\nas a prisoner. \"You needn't be worried about his safety; I'm certain that the\nyoung Mistborn hiding outside the window will be more than enough to\ndeal with me.\"\nElend glanced to the side, toward the small ventilation window beside\nthe more massive stained-glass one. How would the Terriswoman have\nknown that Vin was watching? Her ears would have to be extraordinarily\nkeen. Keen enough, perhaps, to listen in on the meeting through a stone\nwall?\nElend turned back to the newcomer. \"You're a Keeper.\"\nShe nodded.\n\"Did Sazed send you?\"\n\"It is because of him that I am here,\" she said. \"But I was not 'sent.'\"\n\"Ham, it's all right,\" Elend said slowly. \"You can go.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" Ham asked, frowning.\n\"Leave me bound, if you wish,\" the woman said.\nIf she really is a Feruchemist, that won't be much of a hindrance,\nElend thought. Of course, if she really is a Feruchemist—a Keeper, like\nSazed—I shouldn't have anything to fear from her. Theoretically.\nThe others shuffled from the room, their postures indicating what they\nthought of Elend's decision. Though they were no longer thieves by\nprofession, Elend suspected that they—like Vin—would always bear the\neffects of their upbringing.\n\"We'll be just outside, El,\" Ham—the last one out—said, then pulled\nthe door shut.\nAnd yet, any who know me will realize that there was no chance I\nwould give up so easily. Once I find something to investigate, I become\ndogged in my pursuit.\n14\nTHE TERRISWOMAN SNAPPED HER BONDS, and the ropes\ndropped to the floor."

Once I find something to investigate, I become\ndogged in my pursuit.\n14\nTHE TERRISWOMAN SNAPPED HER BONDS, and the ropes\ndropped to the floor.\n\"Uh, Vin?\" Elend said, beginning to wonder about the logic of meeting\nwith this woman. \"Perhaps it's time you came in.\"\n\"She's not actually there,\" the Terriswoman said offhandedly, walking\nforward. \"She left a few minutes ago to do her rounds. That is why I let\nmyself be caught.\"\n\"Um, I see,\" Elend said. \"I'll be calling for the guards now.\"\n\"Don't be a fool,\" the Terriswoman said. \"If I wanted to kill you, I\ncould do it before the others got back in. Now be quiet for a moment.\"\nElend stood uncomfortably as the tall woman walked around the table\nin a slow circle, studying him as a merchant might inspect a piece of\nfurniture up for auction. Finally she stopped, placing her hands on her hips.\n\"Stand up straight,\" she commanded.\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"You're slouching,\" the woman said. \"A king must maintain an air of\ndignity at all times, even when with his friends.\"\nElend frowned. \"Now, while I appreciate advice, I don't—\"\n\"No,\" the woman said. \"Don't hedge. Command.\"\n\"Excuse me?\" Elend said again.\nThe woman stepped forward, placing a hand on his shoulder and\npressing his back firmly to improve his posture. She stepped back, then\nnodded slightly to herself.\n\"Now, see,\" Elend said. \"I don't—\"\n\"No,\" the woman interrupted. \"You must be stronger in the way that\nyou speak. Presentation—words, actions, postures—will determine how\npeople judge you and react to you. If you start every sentence with softness\nand uncertainty, you will seem soft and uncertain. Be forceful!\"\n\"What is going on here?\" Elend demanded, exasperated.\n\"There,\" the woman said. \"Finally.\"\n\"You said that you know Sazed?\" Elend asked, resisting the urge to\nslouch back into his earlier posture.\n\"He is an acquaintance,\" the woman said. \"My name is Tindwyl; I am,\nas you have guessed, a Keeper of Terris.\" She tapped her foot for a moment,\nthen shook her head. \"Sazed warned me about your slovenly appearance,\nbut I honestly assumed that no king could have such a poor sense of self-\npresentation.\"\n\"Slovenly?\" Elend asked. \"Excuse me?\"\n\"Stop saying that,\" Tindwyl snapped. \"Don't ask questions; say what\nyou mean. If you object, object—don't leave your words up to my\ninterpretation.\"\n\"Yes, well, while this is fascinating,\" Elend said, walking toward the\ndoor, \"I'd rather avoid further insults this evening. If you'll excuse me. . .\"\n\"Your people think you are a fool, Elend Venture,\" Tindwyl said\nquietly.\nElend paused.\n\"The Assembly—a body you yourself organized—ignores your\nauthority. The skaa are convinced that you won't be able to protect them.\nEven your own council of friends makes their plans in your absence,\nassuming your input to be no great loss.\""

A man can only lead when others accept him\nas their leader, and he has only as much authority as his subjects give to\nhim. All of the brilliant ideas in the world cannot save your kingdom if no\none will listen to them.\"\nElend turned. \"This last year I've read every pertinent book on\nleadership and governance in the four libraries.\"\nTindwyl raised an eyebrow. \"Then, I suspect that you spent a great deal\nof time in your room that you should have been out, being seen by your\npeople and learning to be a ruler.\"\n\"Books have great value,\" Elend said.\n\"Actions have greater value.\"\n\"And where am I to learn the proper actions?\"\n\"From me.\"\nElend paused.\n\"You may know that every Keeper has an area of special interest,\"\nTindwyl said. \"While we all memorize the same store of information, one\nperson can only study and understand a limited amount of that store. Our\nmutual friend Sazed spends his time on religions.\"\n\"And your specialty?\"\n\"Biographies,\" she said. \"I have studied the lives of generals, kings,\nand emperors whose names you have never heard. Understanding theories\nof politics and leadership, Elend Venture, is not the same as understanding\nthe lives of men who lived such principles.\"\n\"And. . .you can teach me to emulate those men?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Tindwyl said. \"I haven't yet decided whether or not you're a\nhopeless case. But, I am here, so I will do what I can. A few months ago, I\nreceived a letter from Sazed, explaining your predicament. He did not ask\nme to come to train you—but, then, Sazed is perhaps another man who\ncould learn to be more forceful.\"\nElend nodded slowly, meeting the Terriswoman's eyes.\n\"Will you accept my instruction, then?\" she asked.\nElend thought for a moment. If she's anywhere near as useful as Sazed,\nthen. . .well, I could certainly use some help at this. \"I will,\" he said.\nTindwyl nodded. \"Sazed also mentioned your humility. It could be an\nasset—assuming you don't let it get in the way. Now, I believe that your\nMistborn has returned.\"\nElend turned toward the side window. The shutter swung open,\nallowing mist to begin streaming into the room and revealing a crouching,\ncloaked form.\n\"How did you know I was here?\" Vin asked quietly.\nTindwyl smiled—the first such expression Elend had seen on her face.\n\"Sazed mentioned you as well, child. You and I should speak soon in\nprivate, I think.\"\nVin slipped into the room, drawing mist in behind her, then closed the\nshutter. She didn't bother to hide her hostility or mistrust as she put herself\nbetween Elend and Tindwyl.\n\"Why are you here?\" Vin demanded."

He\nimmediately noticed her discarded bonds. He didn't say anything, however;\nhe likely assumed that Elend had freed her.\n\"I think we're done for the night, everyone,\" Elend said. \"Ham, would\nyou see that Mistress Tindwyl is given quarters in the palace? She's a friend\nof Sazed's.\"\nHam shrugged. \"All right, then.\" He nodded to Vin, then withdrew.\nTindwyl did not bid them good night as she left.\nVin frowned, then glanced at Elend. He seemed. . .distracted. \"I don't\nlike her,\" she said.\nElend smiled, stacking up the books on his table. \"You don't like\nanyone when you first meet them, Vin.\"\n\"I liked you.\"\n\"Thereby demonstrating that you are a terrible judge of character.\"\nVin paused, then smiled. She walked over and began picking through\nthe books. They weren't typical Elend fare—far more practical than the\nkinds of things he usually read. \"How did it go tonight?\" she asked. \"I didn't\nhave much time to listen.\"\nElend sighed. He turned, sitting down on the table, looking up at the\nmassive rose window at the back of the room. It was dark, its colors only\nhinted as reflections in the black glass. \"It went well, I suppose.\"\n\"I told you they'd like your plan. It's the sort of thing they'll find\nchallenging.\"\n\"I suppose,\" Elend said.\nVin frowned. \"All right,\" she said, hopping up to stand on the table.\nShe sat down beside him. \"What is it? Is it something that woman said?\nWhat did she want, anyway?\"\n\"Just to pass on some knowledge,\" he said. \"You know how Keepers\nare, always wanting an ear to listen to their lessons.\"\n\"I suppose,\" Vin said slowly. She hadn't ever seen Elend depressed, but\nhe did get discouraged. He had so many ideas, so many plans and hopes,\nthat she sometimes wondered how he kept them all straight. She would\nhave said that he lacked focus; Reen had always said that focus kept a thief\nalive. Elend's dreams, however, were so much a part of who he was. She\ndoubted he could discard them.

Usually, he\nwas the one who reassured her. \"It's still a better way,\" she said. \"The others\nprobably just suggested a weaker plan because they thought you wouldn't\ngo along with something more daring.\"\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"They weren't pandering to me, Vin. They really\nthought that making a strategic alliance was a good, safe plan.\" He paused,\nthen looked at her. \"Since when did that group represent the reasonable side\nof my government?\"\n\"They've had to grow,\" Vin said. \"They can't be the men they once\nwere, not with this much responsibility.\"\nElend turned back toward the window. \"I'll tell you what worries me,\nVin.

If that's the case, then what I'm proposing is just downright\nludicrous.\"\nVin squeezed his shoulder. \"We fought the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"You had Kelsier then.\"\n\"Not that again.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" Elend said. \"But, really, Vin. Maybe my plan to try and\nhold on to the government is just arrogance. What was it you told me about\nyour childhood? When you were in the thieving crews, and everyone was\nbigger, stronger, and meaner than you, what did you do? Did you stand up\nto the leaders?\"\nMemories flashed in her mind. Memories of hiding, of keeping her\neyes down, of weakness.\n\"That was then,\" she said. \"You can't let others beat on you forever.\nThat's what Kelsier taught me—that's why we fought the Lord Ruler. That's\nwhy the skaa rebellion fought the Final Empire all those years, even when\nthere was no chance of winning. Reen taught me that the rebels were fools.\nBut Reen is dead now—and so is the Final Empire. And. . .\"\nShe leaned down, catching Elend's eyes. \"You can't give up the city,\nElend,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think I'd like what that would do to you.\"\nElend paused, then smiled slowly. \"You can be very wise sometimes,\nVin.\"\n\"You think that?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"then obviously you're as poor a judge of character as\nI am.\"\nElend laughed, putting his arm around her, hugging her against his\nside. \"So, I assume the patrol tonight was uneventful?\""

The last time she'd told\nhim of the mist spirit, he'd immediately thought she'd been seeing things.\n\"See,\" Elend said, \"you should have come to the meeting; I would\nhave liked to have had you here.\"\nShe said nothing.\nThey sat for a few minutes, looking up at the dark window. There was\nan odd beauty to it; the colors weren't visible because of the lack of back\nlight, and she could instead focus on the patterns of glass.

I'm worried about other things.\"\n\"Like what?\"\n\"Well. . .I've been thinking about what the Lord Ruler said, right\nbefore I killed him. Do you remember?\"\nElend nodded. He hadn't been there, but she'd told him.\n\"He talked about what he'd done for mankind,\" Vin said. \"He saved us,\nthe stories say. From the Deepness.\"\nElend nodded.\n\"But,\" Vin said, \"what was the Deepness? You were a nobleman—\nreligion wasn't forbidden to you. What did the Ministry teach about the\nDeepness and the Lord Ruler?\"\nElend shrugged. \"Not much, really. Religion wasn't forbidden, but it\nwasn't encouraged either. There was something proprietary about the\nMinistry, an air that implied they would take care of religious things—that\nwe didn't need to worry ourselves.\"\n\"But they did teach you about some things, right?\"\nElend nodded. \"Mostly, they talked about why the nobility were\nprivileged and the skaa cursed. I guess they wanted us to understand how\nfortunate we were—though honestly, I always found the teachings a little\ndisturbing. See, they claimed that we were noble because our ancestors\nsupported the Lord Ruler before the Ascension. But, that means that we\nwere privileged because of what other people had done. Not really fair, eh?\"\nVin shrugged. \"Fair as anything else, I guess.\"\n\"But, didn't you get angry?\" Elend said. \"Didn't it frustrate you that the\nnobility had so much while you had so little?\"\n\"I didn't think about it,\" Vin said. \"The nobility had a lot, so we could\ntake it from them. Why should I care how they got it? Sometimes, when I\nhad food, other thieves beat me and took it. What did it matter how I got my\nfood? It was still taken from me.\"\nElend paused. \"You know, sometimes I wonder what the political\ntheorists I've read would say if they met you.

There are several statues in the city depicting the event.\"\nVin frowned. \"Yes, but they never really show what the Deepness\nlooked like. It's depicted as a twisted lump at the Lord Ruler's feet.\"\n\"Well, the last person who actually saw the Deepness died a year ago,\nso I guess we'll have to make do with the statues.\"\n\"Unless it comes back,\" Vin said quietly.\nElend frowned, looking at her again. \"Is that what this is about, Vin?\"\nHis face softened slightly. \"Two armies aren't enough? You have to worry\nabout the fate of the world as well?\"\nVin glanced down sheepishly, and Elend laughed, pulling her close.\n\"Ah, Vin.

I haven't heard any reports of monstrous incarnations of evil\nrampaging across the land.\"\nVin nodded, and Elend leaned back a bit, obviously assuming that he'd\nanswered her question.\nThe Hero of Ages traveled to the Well of Ascension to defeat the\nDeepness, she thought. But the prophecies all said that the Hero shouldn't\ntake the Well's power for himself. He was supposed to give it, trust in the\npower itself to destroy the Deepness.\nRashek didn't do that—he took the power for himself. Wouldn't that\nmean that the Deepness was never defeated? Why, then, wasn't the world\ndestroyed?\n\"The red sun and brown plants,\" Vin said. \"Did the Deepness do that?\"\n\"Still thinking about that?\" Elend frowned. \"Red sun and brown\nplants? What other colors would they be?\"\n\"Kelsier said that the sun was once yellow, and plants were green.\"\n\"That's an odd image.\"\n\"Sazed agrees with Kelsier,\" Vin said. \"The legends all say that during\nthe early days of the Lord Ruler, the sun changed colors, and ash began to\nfall from the skies.\"\n\"Well,\" Elend said, \"I guess the Deepness could have had something to\ndo with it.

Hopefully, they can sort through the staff with minimal\ndisturbance and locate the impostor.\"\nVin's senses itched at how trusting Elend was. No, she thought. Let him\nassume the best. He has enough to worry about. Besides, perhaps the\nkandra is imitating someone outside our core team. Elend can search that\navenue.\nAnd, if the impostor is a member of the crew. . .Well, that's the sort of\nsituation where my paranoia comes in handy.\n\"Anyway,\" Elend said, standing. \"I have a few things to check on\nbefore it gets too late.\"\nVin nodded.

The ash was deeper here, without the cover of trees, and there was\nalso more wind blowing it into drifts. Sazed regarded the windswept\nlandscape. There was no further sign of Marsh.\nSazed returned to camp. The trees here—in the middle of the Eastern\nDominance—rose twisted and knotted, but they had shelflike, overlapping\nbranches, thick with brown needles. These provided decent shelter, though\nthe ash seemed capable of infiltrating any sanctuary.\nSazed made a simple soup for breakfast. Marsh did not return. Sazed\nwashed his brown travel robes in a nearby stream. Marsh did not return.\nSazed sewed a rent in his sleeve, oiled his walking boots, and shaved his\nhead. Marsh did not return. Sazed got out the rubbing he'd made in the\nConventical, transcribed a few words, then forced himself to put the sheet\naway—he worried about blurring the words by opening it too often or by\ngetting ash on it. Better to wait until he could have a proper desk and clean\nroom.\nMarsh did not return.\nFinally, Sazed left. He couldn't define the sense of urgency that he felt\n—part excitement to share what he had learned, part desire to see how Vin\nand the young king Elend Venture were handling events in Luthadel.\nMarsh knew the way. He would catch up.\nSazed raised his hand, shading his eyes against the red sunlight,\nlooking down from his hilltop vantage. There was a slight darkness on the\nhorizon, to the east of the main road. He tapped his geography coppermind,\nseeking out descriptions of the Eastern Dominance.\nThe knowledge swelled his mind, blessing him with recollection. The\ndarkness was a village named Urbene. He searched through one of his\nindexes, looking for the right gazetteer. The index was growing fuzzy, its\ninformation difficult to remember—which meant that he'd switched it from\ncoppermind to memory and back too many times. Knowledge inside a\ncoppermind would remain pristine, but anything inside his head—even for\nonly a few moments—would decay. He'd have to re-memorize the index\nlater.\nHe found what he was looking for, and dumped the right memories\ninto his head. The gazetteer listed Urbene as \"picturesque,\" which probably\nmeant that some important nobleman had decided to make his manor there.\nThe listing said that the skaa of Urbene were herdsmen.\nSazed scribbled a note to himself, then redeposited the gazetteer's\nmemories. Reading the note told him what he had just forgotten. Like the\nindex, the gazetteer memories had inevitably decayed slightly during their\nstay in his head. Fortunately, he had a second set of copperminds hidden\nback up in Terris, and would use those to pass his knowledge on to another"

        "text": "stay in his head. Fortunately, he had a second set of copperminds hidden\nback up in Terris, and would use those to pass his knowledge on to another\nKeeper. His current copperminds were for everyday use. Unapplied\nknowledge benefited no one.\nHe shouldered his pack. A visit to the village would do him some\ngood, even if it slowed him down. His stomach agreed with the decision. It\nwas unlikely the peasants would have much in the way of food, but perhaps\nthey would be able to provide something other than broth. Besides, they\nmight have news of events at Luthadel.\nHe hiked down the short hill, taking the smaller, eastern fork in the\nroad. Once, there had been little travel in the Final Empire. The Lord Ruler\nhad forbidden skaa to leave their indentured lands, and only thieves and\nrebels had dared disobey. Still, most of the nobility had made their livings\nby trading, so a village such as this one might be accustomed to visitors.\nSazed began to notice the oddities immediately. Goats roamed the\ncountryside along the road, unwatched. Sazed paused, then dug a\ncoppermind from his pack. He searched through it as he walked. One book\non husbandry claimed that herdsmen sometimes left their flocks alone to\ngraze. Yet, the unwatched animals made him nervous. He quickened his\npace.\nJust to the south, the skaa starve, he thought. Yet here, livestock is so\nplentiful that nobody can be spared to keep it safe from bandits or\npredators?\nThe small village appeared in the distance. Sazed could almost\nconvince himself that the lack of activity—the lack of movement in the\nstreets, the derelict doors and shutters swinging in the breeze—was due to\nhis approach. Perhaps the people were so scared that they were hiding. Or,\nperhaps they simply were all out. Tending flocks. . ..\nSazed stopped. A shift in the wind brought a telltale scent from the\nvillage. The skaa weren't hiding, and they hadn't fled. It was the scent of\nrotting bodies.\nSuddenly urgent, Sazed pulled out a small ring—a scent tinmind—and\nslipped it on his thumb. The smell on the wind, it didn't seem like that of a\nslaughter. It was a mustier, dirtier smell. A smell not only of death, but of\ncorruption, unwashed bodies, and waste. He reversed the use of the tinmind,\nfilling it instead of tapping it, and his ability to smell grew very weak—\nkeeping him from gagging.\nHe continued on, carefully entering the village proper. Like most skaa\nvillages, Urbene was organized simply. It had a group of ten large hovels\nbuilt in a loose circle with a well at the center. The buildings were wood,\nand for thatching they used the same needle-bearing branches from the trees\nhe'd seen. Overseers' huts, along with a fine nobleman's manor, stood a little\nfarther up the valley.\nIf it hadn't been for the smell—and the sense of haunted emptiness—\nSazed might have agreed with his gazetteer's description of Urbene. For\nskaa residences, the hovels looked well maintained, and the village lay in a\nquiet hollow amid the rising landscape."

For\nskaa residences, the hovels looked well maintained, and the village lay in a\nquiet hollow amid the rising landscape.\nIt wasn't until he got a little closer that he found the first bodies. They\nlay scattered around the doorway to the nearest hovel, about a half-dozen of\nthem. Sazed approached carefully, but could quickly see that the corpses\nwere at least several days old. He knelt beside the first one, that of a\nwoman, and could see no visible cause of death. The others were the same.\nNervous, Sazed forced himself to reach up and pull open the door to\nthe hovel. The stench from inside was so strong that he could smell it\nthrough his tinmind.\nThe hovel, like most, was only a single chamber. It was filled with\nbodies. Most lay wrapped in thin blankets; some sat with backs pressed up\nagainst the walls, rotting heads hanging limply from their necks. They had\ngaunt, nearly fleshless bodies with withered limbs and protruding ribs.\nHaunted, unseeing eyes sat in desiccated faces.\nThese people had died of starvation and dehydration.\nSazed stumbled from the hovel, head bowed. He didn't expect to find\nanything different in the other buildings, but he checked anyway. He saw\nthe same scene repeated again and again. Woundless corpses on the ground\noutside; many more bodies huddled inside. Flies buzzing about in swarms,\ncovering faces. In several of the buildings he found gnawed human bones at\nthe center of the room.\nHe stumbled out of the final hovel, breathing deeply through his\nmouth. Dozens of people, over a hundred total, dead for no obvious reason.\nWhat possibly could have caused so many of them to simply sit, hidden in\ntheir houses, while they ran out of food and water? How could they have\nstarved when there were beasts running free? And what had killed those that\nhe'd found outside, lying in the ash? They didn't seem as emaciated as the\nones inside, though from the level of decomposition, it was difficult to tell.\nI must be mistaken about the starvation, Sazed told himself. It must\nhave been a plague of some sort, a disease. That is a much more logical\nexplanation. He searched through his medical coppermind. Surely there\nwere diseases that could strike quickly, leaving their victims weakened. And\nthe survivors must have fled. Leaving behind their loved ones. Not taking\nany of the animals from their pastures. . ..\nSazed frowned. At that moment, he thought he heard something.\nHe spun, drawing auditory power from his hearing tinmind. The\nsounds were there—the sound of breathing, the sound of movement,\ncoming from one of the hovels he'd visited. He dashed forward, throwing\nopen the door, looking again on the sorry dead. The corpses lay where they\nhad been before. Sazed studied them very carefully, this time watching until\nhe found the one whose chest was moving.\nBy the forgotten gods. . .Sazed thought. The man didn't need to work\nhard to feign death. His hair had fallen out, and his eyes were sunken into\nhis face. Though he didn't look particularly starved, Sazed must have\nmissed seeing him because of his dirty, almost corpselike body."

He huddled down, staring at Sazed.\n\"Please,\" Sazed said, setting down his pack. \"You mustn't be afraid.\"\nThe only food he had besides broth spices was a few handfuls of meal, but\nhe pulled some out. \"I have food.\"\nThe man shook his head. \"There is no food,\" he whispered. \"We ate it\nall.

Uncooked, gnawed on, placed\nin a pile beneath a ragged cloth, as if to hide them.\n\"I didn't eat the food,\" the man whispered.\n\"I know,\" Sazed said, taking a step forward. \"But, there is other food.\nOutside.\"\n\"Can't go outside.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nThe man paused, then looked down. \"Mist.\"\nSazed glanced toward the doorway. The sun was nearing the horizon,\nbut wouldn't set for another hour or so. There was no mist. Not now,\nanyway.\nSazed felt a chill. He slowly turned back toward the man. \"Mist. .\n.during the day?\"\nThe man nodded.\n\"And it stayed?\" Sazed asked. \"It didn't go away after a few hours?\"\nThe man shook his head. \"Days. Weeks. All mist.\"\nLord Ruler! Sazed thought, then caught himself. It had been a long\ntime since he'd sworn by that creature's name, even in his thoughts.\nBut for the mist to come during the day, then to stay—if this man were\nto be believed—for weeks. . .Sazed could imagine the skaa, frightened in\ntheir hovels, a thousand years of terror, tradition, and superstition keeping\nthem from venturing outside.\nBut to remain inside until they starved? Even their fear of the mist,\ndeep-seated though it was, wouldn't have been enough to make them starve\nthemselves to death, would it?\n\"Why didn't you leave?\" Sazed asked quietly.\n\"Some did,\" the man said, nodding as if to himself. \"Jell. You know\nwhat happened to him.\"\nSazed frowned. \"Dead?\"\n\"Taken by the mist. Oh, how he shook. Was a bull-headed one, you\nknow. Old Jell. Oh, how he shook. How he writhed when it took him.\"\nSazed closed his eyes. The corpses I found outside the doors.\n\"Some got away,\" the man said.\nSazed snapped his eyes open. \"What?\"\nThe crazed villager nodded again. \"Some got away, you know.

What is the connection?\"\nThe man turned toward him. \"Time for food,\" he said, then rose. He\nwandered over to a corpse, then pulled on an arm, ripping the rotted meat\nfree. It was easy to see why he hadn't starved to death like the others.\nSazed pushed aside nausea, striding across the room and grabbing the\nman's arm as he raised the near fleshless bone to his lips. The man froze,\nthen looked up at Sazed. \"It's not mine!\" he yelped, dropping the bone and\nrunning to the back of the room.\nSazed stood for a moment. I must hurry. I must get to Luthadel. There\nis more wrong with this world than bandits and armies.\nThe wild man watched with a feral sort of terror as Sazed picked up\nhis pack, then paused and set it down again. He pulled out his largest\npewtermind. He fastened the wide metal bracer to his forearm, then turned\nand walked toward the villager.\n\"No!\" the man screamed, trying to dash to the side. Sazed tapped the\npewtermind, pulling out a burst of strength. He felt his muscles enlarge, his\nrobes growing tight. He snatched the villager as the man ran passed, then\nheld him out, far enough away that the man couldn't do either of them much\nharm.\nThen he carried the man outside of the building.\nThe man stopped struggling as soon as they emerged into the sunlight.\nHe looked up, as if seeing the sun for the first time.

Why did he go?\"\n\"The Lord Ruler was a tyrant.\"\nThe man shook his head. \"He loved us. He ruled us. Now that he's\ngone, the mists can kill us. They hate us.\"\nThen, surprisingly adroit, the man leaped to his feet and scrambled\ndown the pathway out of the village. Sazed took a step forward, but paused.\nWhat would he do? Pull the man all the way to Luthadel? There was water\nin the well and there were animals to eat. Sazed could only hope that the\npoor wretch would be able to manage.\nSighing, Sazed returned to the hovel and retrieved his pack. On his\nway out, he paused, then pulled out one of his steelminds. Steel held one of\nthe very most difficult attributes to store up: physical speed. He had spent\nmonths filling this particular steelmind in preparation for the possibility that\nsomeday he might need to run somewhere very, very quickly.\nHe put it on now."

I don't know if he himself believed it, but he made\nothers think that he must be the one.\n16\nVIN RARELY USED HER QUARTERS. Elend had assigned her\nspacious rooms—which was, perhaps, part of the problem. She'd spent her\nchildhood sleeping in nooks, lairs, or alleys. Having three separate\nchambers was a bit daunting.\nIt didn't really matter, however. During her time awake she was with\neither Elend or the mists. Her rooms existed for her to sleep in. Or, in this\ncase, for her to make a mess in.\nShe sat on the floor in the center of her main chamber. Elend's steward,\nconcerned that Vin didn't have any furniture, had insisted on decorating her\nrooms. This morning, Vin had pushed some of this aside, bunching up rugs\nand chairs on one side so that she could sit on the cool stones with her book.\nIt was the first real book she had ever owned, though it was just a\ncollection of pages bound loosely at one side. That suited her just fine; the\nsimple binding had made the book that much easier to pull apart.\nShe sat amid stacks of paper. It was amazing how many pages there\nwere in the book, once she had separated them. Vin sat next to one pile,\nlooking over its contents. She shook her head, then crawled over to another\npile. She leafed through the pages, eventually selecting one.\nSometimes I wonder if I'm going mad, the words read. Perhaps it is\ndue to the pressure of knowing that I must somehow bear the burden of an\nentire world. Perhaps it is caused by the death I have seen, the friends I\nhave lost. The friends I have been forced to kill.\nEither way, I sometimes see shadows following me. Dark creatures\nthat I don't understand, nor do I wish to understand. They are, perhaps,\nsome figment of my overtaxed mind?\nVin sat for a moment, rereading the paragraphs. Then she moved the\nsheet over to another pile. OreSeur lay on the side of the room, head on\npaws, eyeing her. \"Mistress,\" he said as she set down the page, \"I have been\nwatching you work for the last two hours, and will admit that I am\nthoroughly confused. What is the point of all this?\"\nVin crawled over to another stack of pages. \"I thought you didn't care\nhow I spent my time.\"\n\"I don't,\" OreSeur said. \"But I do get bored.\"\n\"And annoyed, apparently.\"\n\"I like to understand what is going on around me.\"\nVin shrugged, gesturing toward the stacks of paper. \"This is the Lord\nRuler's logbook. Well, actually, it's not the logbook of the Lord Ruler we\nknew, but the logbook of the man who should have been the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"Should have been?\" OreSeur asked. \"You mean he should have\nconquered the world, but didn't?\""

This man, the man who wrote this book—\nwe don't actually know his name—was some kind of prophesied hero. Or. .\n.everyone thought he was. Anyway, the man who became the Lord Ruler—\nRashek—was this hero's packman. Don't you remember us talking about\nthis, back when you were imitating Renoux?\"\nOreSeur nodded. \"I recall you briefly mentioning it.\"\n\"Well, this is the book Kelsier and I found when we infiltrated the Lord\nRuler's palace. We thought it was written by the Lord Ruler, but it turns out\nit was written by the man the Lord Ruler killed, the man whose place he\ntook.\"\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"Now, why exactly are you tearing it to\npieces?\"\n\"I'm not,\" Vin said. \"I just took off the binding so I could move the\npages around. It helps me think.\"\n\"I. . .see,\" OreSeur said. \"And, what exactly are you looking for? The\nLord Ruler is dead, Mistress. Last I checked, you killed him.\"\nWhat am I looking for? Vin thought, picking up another page. Ghosts\nin the mist.\nShe read the words on this page slowly.\nIt isn't a shadow.\nThis dark thing that follows me, the thing that only I can see—it isn't\nreally a shadow. It is blackish and translucent, but it doesn't have a\nshadowlike solid outline. It's insubstantial—wispy and formless. Like it's\nmade out of black fog.\nOr mist, perhaps.\nVin lowered the page. It watched him, too, she thought. She\nremembered reading the words over a year before, thinking that the Hero\nmust have started to go mad. With all the pressures on him, who would\nhave been surprised?\nNow, however, she thought she understood the nameless logbook\nauthor better. She knew he was not the Lord Ruler, and could see him for\nwhat he might have been. Uncertain of his place in the world, but forced\ninto important events. Determined to do the best he could. Idealistic, in a\nway.\nAnd the mist spirit had chased him. What did it mean? What did seeing\nit imply for her?\nShe crawled over to another pile of pages. She'd spent the morning\nscanning through the logbook for clues about the mist creature. However,\nshe was having trouble digging out much beyond these two, familiar\npassages.\nShe made piles of pages that mentioned anything strange or\nsupernatural. She made a small pile with pages that referenced the mist\nspirit. She also had a special pile for references to the Deepness. This last\none, ironically, was both the largest and least informative of the group. The\nlogbook author had a habit of mentioning the Deepness, but not saying\nmuch about it.\nThe Deepness was dangerous, that much was clear. It had ravaged the\nland, slaying thousands.

However, the tone of the logbook really was more melancholy than\nit was informative. It was something that the Hero had written for himself,\nto stay sane, to let him put his fears and hopes down on paper. Elend said he\nwrote for similar reasons, sometimes. To Vin, it seemed a silly method of\ndealing with problems.\nWith a sigh, she turned to the last stack of papers—the one with pages\nshe had yet to study. She lay down on the stone floor and began to read,\nsearching for useful information.\nIt took time. Not only was she a slow reader, but her mind kept\nwandering. She'd read the logbook before—and, oddly, hints and phrases\nfrom it reminded her of where she'd been at the time. Two years and a world\naway in Fellise, still recovering from her near death at the hands of a Steel\nInquisitor, she'd been forced to spend her days pretending to be Valette\nRenoux, a young, inexperienced country noblewoman.\nBack then, she still hadn't believed in Kelsier's plan to overthrow the\nFinal Empire. She'd stayed with the crew because she valued the strange\nthings they offered her—friendship, trust, and lessons in Allomancy—not\nbecause she accepted their goals. She would never have guessed where that\nwould lead her. To balls and parties, to actually growing—just a bit—to\nbecome the noblewoman she had pretended to be.\nBut that had been a farce, a few months of make-believe. She forced\nher thoughts away from the frilly clothing and the dances. She needed to\nfocus on practical matters.\nAnd. . .is this practical? she thought idly, setting a page in one of the\nstacks. Studying things I barely comprehend, fearing a threat nobody else\neven cares to notice?\nShe sighed, folding her arms under her chin as she lay on her stomach.\nWhat was she really worried about? That the Deepness would return? All\nshe had were a few phantom visions in the mist—things that could, as\nElend implied, have easily been fabricated by her overworked mind. More\nimportant was another question. Assuming that the Deepness was real, what\ndid she expect to do about it? She was no hero, general, or leader.\nOh, Kelsier, she thought, picking up another page. We could use you\nnow. Kelsier had been a man beyond convention. . .a man who had\nsomehow been able to defy reality. He'd thought that by giving his life to\noverthrow the Lord Ruler, he would secure freedom for the skaa. But, what\nif his sacrifice had opened the way for a greater danger, something so\ndestructive that the Lord Ruler's oppression was a preferable alternative?\nShe finally finished the page, then placed it in the stack of those that\ncontained no useful information.

I must assume that I am not mad, the words said. I cannot,\nwith any rational sense of confidence, continue my quest if I do not believe\nthis. The thing following me must, therefore, be real.\nShe sat up. She only vaguely remembered this section of the logbook.\nThe book was organized like a diary, with sequential—but dateless—\nentries. It had a tendency to ramble, and the Hero had been fond of droning\non about his insecurities. This section had been particularly dry.\nBut there, in the middle of his complaining, was a tidbit of\ninformation.\nI believe that it would kill me, if it could, the text continued.\nThere is an evil feel to the thing of shadow and fog, and my skin recoils\nat its touch. Yet, it seems limited in what it can do, especially to me.\nIt can affect this world, however. The knife it placed in Fedik's chest\nproves that much.

The alternative is to admit that it was I who\nheld that knife.\nSomehow, knowing Rashek's opinion on the matter makes it much\neasier for me to believe the opposite.\nThe next page continued on about Rashek, and the next several entries\ncontained no mention of the mist spirit. However, Vin found even these few\nparagraphs exciting.\nHe made a decision, she thought. I have to make the same one. She'd\nnever worried that she was mad, but she had sensed some logic in Elend's\nwords. Now she rejected them.

They have to be so sure that I'm willing to side with\nthem, that they don't consider that I might be working with their enemies,\ntoo.\nAs Elend watched, he noticed someone climbing up the steps to the\nwall. Clubs. The general hobbled over to Elend, who had been standing\nalone. \"Congratulations,\" Clubs said. \"Looks like you now have a full-\nblown siege on your hands.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"It'll give us a little breathing room, I guess,\" Clubs said. Then he eyed\nElend with one of his gnarled looks. \"You'd better be up to this, kid.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend whispered.\n\"You've made yourself the focal point,\" Clubs said. \"The Assembly\ncan't break this siege until you meet officially with Straff, and the kings\naren't likely to meet with anyone on the crew other than yourself. This is all\nabout you. Useful place for a king to be, I suppose. If he's a good one.\"\nClubs fell silent. Elend stood, looking out over the separate armies.\nThe words spoken to him by Tindwyl the Terriswoman still bothered him.\nYou are a fool, Elend Venture. . ..\nSo far, neither of the kings had responded to Elend's requests for a\nmeeting—though the crew was sure that they soon would. His enemies\nwould wait, to make Elend sweat a bit. The Assembly had just called\nanother meeting, probably to try and bully him into releasing them from\ntheir earlier proposal. Elend had found a convenient reason to skip the\nmeeting.\nHe looked at Clubs. \"And am I a good king, Clubs? In your opinion.\"\nThe general glanced at him, and Elend saw a harsh wisdom in his eyes.\n\"I've known worse leaders,\" he said. \"But I've also known a hell of a lot\nbetter.\"\nElend nodded slowly. \"I want to be good at this, Clubs. Nobody else is\ngoing to look after the skaa like they deserve. Cett, Straff. They'd just make\nslaves of the people again. I. . .I want to be more than my ideas, though. I\nwant to—need to—be a man that others can look to.\""

I\nwant to—need to—be a man that others can look to.\"\nClubs shrugged. \"My experience has been that the man is usually made\nby the situation. Kelsier was a selfish dandy until the Pits nearly broke\nhim.\" He glanced at Elend. \"Will this siege be your Pits of Hathsin, Elend\nVenture?\"\n\"I don't know,\" he said honestly.\n\"Then we'll have to wait and see, I guess. For now, someone wants to\nspeak with you.\" He turned, nodding down toward the street some forty feet\nbelow, where a tall, feminine figure stood in colorful Terris robes.\n\"She told me to send you down,\" Clubs said. He paused, then glanced\nat Elend. \"It isn't often you meet someone who feels like they can order me\naround. And a Terriswoman at that. I thought those Terris were all docile\nand kindly.\"\nElend smiled. \"I guess Sazed spoiled us.\"\nClubs snorted. \"So much for a thousand years of breeding, eh?\"\nElend nodded.\n\"You sure she's safe?\" Clubs asked.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said. \"Her story checks out—Vin brought in several of\nthe Terris people from the city, and they knew and recognized Tindwyl.\nShe's apparently a fairly important person back in her homeland.\"\nPlus, she had performed Feruchemy for him, growing stronger to free\nher hands. That meant she wasn't a kandra. All of it together meant that she\nwas trustworthy enough; even Vin admitted that, even if she continued to\ndislike the Terriswoman.\nClubs nodded to him, and Elend took a deep breath. Then he walked\ndown the stairs to meet Tindwyl for another round of lessons.\n\"Today, we will do something about your clothing,\" Tindwyl said,\nclosing the door to Elend's study. A plump seamstress with bowl-cut white\nhair waited inside, standing respectfully with a group of youthful assistants.\nElend glanced down at his clothing. It actually wasn't bad. The suit\ncoat and vest fit fairly well. The trousers weren't as stiff as those favored by\nimperial nobility, but he was the king now; shouldn't he be able to set the\ntrends?\n\"I don't see what's wrong with it,\" he said. He held up a hand as\nTindwyl began to speak. \"I know it's not quite as formal as what other men\nlike to wear, but it suits me.\"\n\"It's disgraceful,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"Now, I hardly see—\"\n\"Don't argue with me.\"\n\"But, see, the other day you said that—\"\n\"Kings don't argue, Elend Venture,\" Tindwyl said firmly. \"They\ncommand. And, part of your ability to command comes from your bearing.\nSlovenly clothing invites other slovenly habits—such as your posture,\nwhich I've already mentioned, I believe.\"\nElend sighed, rolling his eyes as Tindwyl snapped her fingers. The\nseamstress and her assistants started unpacking a pair of large trunks.\n\"This isn't necessary,\" Elend said. \"I already have some suits that fit\nmore snugly; I wear them on formal occasions.\""

In some respects, this was a good\nidea—it gave you a connection to the former government, and made you\nseem less of a deviant. Now, however, you are in a different position. Your\npeople are in danger, and the time for simple diplomacy is over. You are at\nwar. Your dress should reflect that.\"\nThe seamstress selected a particular costume, then brought it over to\nElend while the assistants set up a changing screen.\nElend hesitantly accepted the costume. It was stiff and white, and the\nfront of the jacket appeared to button all the way up to a rigid collar. All and\nall, it looked like. . .\n\"A uniform,\" he said, frowning.\n\"Indeed,\" Tindwyl said. \"You want your people to believe that you can\nprotect them? Well, a king isn't simply a lawmaker—he's a general. It is\ntime you began to act like you deserve your title, Elend Venture.\"\n\"I'm no warrior,\" Elend said. \"This uniform is a lie.\"\n\"The first point we will soon change,\" Tindwyl said. \"The second is\nnot true. You command the armies of the Central Dominance. That makes\nyou a military man whether or not you know how to swing a sword. Now,\ngo change.\"\nElend acceded with a shrug. He walked around the changing screen,\npushed aside a stack of books to make room, then began to change. The\nwhite trousers fit snugly and fell straight around the calves. While there was\na shirt, it was completely obscured by the large, stiff jacket—which had\nmilitary shoulder fittings. It had an array of buttons—all of which, he\nnoticed, were wood instead of metal—as well as a strange shieldlike design\nover the right breast. It seemed to have some sort of arrow, or perhaps spear,\nemblazoned in it.\nStiffness, cut, and design considered, Elend was surprised how well\nthe uniform fit. \"It's sized quite well,\" he noted, putting on the belt, then\npulling down the bottom of the jacket, which came all the way to his hips.\n\"We got your measurements from your tailor,\" Tindwyl said.\nElend stepped around the changing screen, and several assistants\napproached. One politely motioned for him to step into a pair of shiny black\nboots, and the other attached a white cape to fastenings at his shoulders.\nThe final assistant handed him a polished hardwood dueling cane and\nsheath. Elend hooked it onto the belt, then pulled it through a slit in the\njacket so it hung outside; that much, at least, he had done before.\n\"Good,\" Tindwyl said, looking him up and down. \"Once you learn to\nstand up straight, that will be a decent improvement. Now, sit.\""

Now, sit.\"\nElend opened his mouth to object, but thought better of it. He sat\ndown, and an assistant approached to attach a sheet around his shoulders.\nShe then pulled out a pair of shears.\n\"Now, wait,\" Elend said. \"I see where this is going.\"\n\"Then voice an objection,\" Tindwyl said. \"Don't be vague!\"\n\"All right, then,\" Elend said. \"I like my hair.\"\n\"Short hair is easier to care for than long hair,\" Tindwyl said. \"And you\nhave proven that you cannot be trusted in the area of personal grooming.\"\n\"You aren't cutting my hair,\" Elend said firmly.\nTindwyl paused, then nodded. The apprentice backed away, and Elend\nstood, pulling off the sheet. The seamstress produced a large mirror, and\nElend walked forward to inspect himself.\nAnd froze.\nThe difference was surprising. All his life, he'd seen himself as a\nscholar and socialite, but also as just a bit of a fool. He was Elend—the\nfriendly, comfortable man with the funny ideas. Easy to dismiss, perhaps,\nbut difficult to hate.\nThe man he saw now was no dandy of the court. He was a serious man\n—a formal man. A man to be taken seriously. The uniform made him want\nto stand up straighter, to rest one hand on the dueling cane. His hair—\nslightly curled, long on the top and sides, and blown loose by the wind atop\nthe city wall—didn't fit.\nElend turned. \"All right,\" he said. \"Cut it.\"\nTindwyl smiled, then nodded for him to sit. He did so, waiting quietly\nwhile the assistant worked. When he stood again, his head matched the suit.\nIt wasn't extremely short, not like Ham's hair, but it was neat and precise.\nOne of the assistants approached and handed him a loop of silver-painted\nwood. He turned to Tindwyl, frowning.\n\"A crown?\" he asked.\n\"Nothing ostentatious,\" Tindwyl said. \"This is a more subtle era than\nsome of those gone by. The crown isn't a symbol of your wealth, but of your\nauthority. You will wear it from now on, whether you are in private or in\npublic.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler didn't wear a crown.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler didn't need to remind people that he was in charge,\"\nTindwyl said.\nElend paused, then slipped on the crown. It bore no gemstones or\nornamentation; it was just a simple coronet. As he might have expected, it\nfit perfectly.\nHe turned back toward Tindwyl, who waved for the seamstress to pack\nup and leave. \"You have six uniforms like this one waiting for you in your\nrooms,\" Tindwyl said. \"Until this siege is over, you will wear nothing else.\nIf you want variety, change the color of the cape.\"\nElend nodded. Behind him, the seamstress and her assistants slipped\nout the door. \"Thank you,\" he told Tindwyl. \"I was hesitant at first, but you\nare right. This makes a difference.\""

You didn't think that this was it, did you?\"\n\"Well. . .\"\nTindwyl raised an eyebrow. \"A few lessons, and you think you're\nthrough? We've barely begun. You are still a fool, Elend Venture—you just\ndon't look like one anymore. Hopefully, our charade will begin reversing\nsome of the damage you've done to your reputation. However, it is going to\ntake a lot more training before I'll actually trust you to interact with people\nand not embarrass yourself.\"\nElend flushed. \"What do you—\" He paused. \"Tell me what you plan to\nteach me, then.\"\n\"Well, you need to learn how to walk, for one thing.\"\n\"Something's wrong with the way I walk?\"\n\"By the forgotten gods, yes!\" Tindwyl said, sounding amused, though\nno smile marred her lips. \"And your speech patterns still need work.\nBeyond that, of course, there is your inability to handle weapons.\"\n\"I've had some training,\" Elend said. \"Ask Vin—I rescued her from the\nLord Ruler's palace the night of the Collapse!\"\n\"I know,\" Tindwyl said. \"And, from what I've heard, it was a miracle\nyou survived. Fortunately, the girl was there to do the actual fighting. You\napparently rely on her quite a bit for that sort of thing.\"\n\"She's Mistborn.\"\n\"That is no excuse for your slovenly lack of skill,\" Tindwyl said. \"You\ncannot always rely on your woman to protect you. Not only is it\nembarrassing, but your people—your soldiers—will expect you to be able\nto fight with them. I doubt you will ever be the type of leader who can lead\na charge against the enemy, but you should at least be able to handle\nyourself if your position gets attacked.\"\n\"So, you want me to begin sparring with Vin and Ham during their\ntraining sessions?\"\n\"Goodness, no! Can't you imagine how terrible it would be for morale\nif the men saw you being beaten up in public?\" Tindwyl shook her head.\n\"No, we'll have you trained discreetly by a dueling master. Given a few\nmonths, we should have you competent with the cane and the sword.\nHopefully, this little siege of yours will last that long before the fighting\nstarts.\"\nElend flushed again. \"You keep talking down to me. It's like I'm not\neven king in your eyes—like you see me as some kind of placeholder.\"\nTindwyl didn't answer, but her eyes glinted with satisfaction. You said\nit, not I, her expression seemed to say.\nElend flushed more deeply.\n\"You can, perhaps, learn to be a king, Elend Venture,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"Until then, you'll just have to learn to fake it.\"\nElend's angry response was cut off by a knock at the door. Elend\ngritted his teeth, turning. \"Come in.\""

Elend brushed by her, walking over to grab his notebook. \"I'm\ngoing to learn to do more than just 'fake' being king, Tindwyl.\"\n\"We'll see.\"\nElend shot a glance at the middle-aged Terriswoman in her robes and\njewelry.\n\"Practice expressions like that one,\" Tindwyl noted, \"and you just\nmight do it.\"\n\"Is that all it is, then?\" Elend asked. \"Expressions and costumes? Is\nthat what makes a king?\"\n\"Of course not.\"\nElend stopped by the door, turning back. \"Then, what does? What do\nyou think makes a man a good king, Tindwyl of Terris?\"\n\"Trust,\" Tindwyl said, looking him in the eyes. \"A good king is one\nwho is trusted by his people—and one who deserves that trust.\"\nElend paused, then nodded. Good answer, he acknowledged, then\npulled open the door and rushed out to find Vin.\nIf only the Terris religion, and belief in the Anticipation, hadn't spread\nbeyond our people.\n17\nTHE PILES OF PAPER SEEMED to multiply as Vin found more and\nmore ideas in the logbook that she wanted to isolate and remember. What\nwere the prophecies about the Hero of Ages? How did the logbook author\nknow where to go, and what did he think he'd have to do when he got there?\nEventually, lying amid the mess—overlapping piles turned in odd\ndirections to keep them separate—Vin acknowledged a distasteful fact. She\nwas going to have to take notes.\nWith a sigh, she rose and crossed the room, stepping carefully over\nseveral stacks and approaching the room's desk. She'd never used it before;\nin fact, she'd complained about it to Elend. What need did she have of a\nwriting desk?"

What need did she have of a\nwriting desk?\nSo she'd thought. She selected a pen, then pulled out a little jar of ink,\nremembering the days when Reen had taught her to write. He'd quickly\ngrown frustrated with her scratchings, complaining about the cost of ink\nand paper. He'd taught her to read so that she could decipher contracts and\nimitate a noblewoman, but he'd thought that writing was less useful. In\ngeneral, Vin shared this opinion.\nApparently, however, writing had uses even if one wasn't a scribe.\nElend was always scribbling notes and memos to himself; she'd often been\nimpressed by how quickly he could write. How did he make the letters\ncome so easily?\nShe grabbed a couple of blank sheets of paper and walked back over to\nher sorted piles. She sat down with crossed legs and unscrewed the top of\nthe ink bottle.\n\"Mistress,\" OreSeur noted, still lying with his paws before him, \"you\ndo realize that you just left the writing desk behind to sit on the floor.\"\nVin looked up. \"And?\"\n\"The purpose of a writing desk is, well, writing.\"\n\"But my papers are all over here.\"\n\"Papers can be moved, I believe. If they prove too heavy, you could\nalways burn pewter to give yourself more strength.\"\nVin eyed his amused face as she inked the nib of her pen. Well, at least\nhe's displaying something other than his dislike of me. \"The floor is more\ncomfortable.\"\n\"If you say so, Mistress, I will believe it to be true.\"\nShe paused, trying to determine if he was still mocking her or not.\nBlasted dog's face, she thought. Too hard to read.\nWith a sigh, she leaned down and began to write out the first word. She\nhad to make each line precisely so that the ink didn't smudge, and she had\nto pause often to sound out words and find the right letters. She'd barely\nwritten a couple of sentences before a knock came at her door. She looked\nup with a frown. Who was bothering her?\n\"Come in,\" she called.\nShe heard a door open in the other room, and Elend's voice called out.\n\"Vin?\"\n\"In here,\" she said, turning back to her writing. \"Why did you knock?\"\n\"Well, you might have been changing,\" he said, entering.\n\"So?\" Vin asked.\nElend chuckled. \"Two years, and privacy is still a strange concept to\nyou.\"\nVin looked up. \"Well, I did—\"\nFor just the briefest flash of a moment, she thought he was someone\nelse. Her instincts kicked in before her brain, and she reflexively dropped\nthe pen, jumping up and flaring pewter.\nThen she stopped.\n\"That much of a change, eh?\" Elend asked, holding out his arms so she\ncould get a better look at his costume.\nVin put a hand to her chest, so shocked that she stepped right on one of\nher stacks. It was Elend, but it wasn't. The brilliant white costume, with its\nsharp lines and firm figure, looked so different from his normal loose jacket\nand trousers. He seemed more commanding. More regal."

A messenger from my father's army has arrived. I'm making him\nwait for a bit—it didn't seem wise to appear too eager. But, we should\nprobably go meet with him.\"\nVin nodded, waving to OreSeur.

He didn't look much like a messenger or\ncourier. He wore all black, even a pair of black gloves. He wore trousers\nand a silken shirt, with no cloak or cape. She remembered that face. It was\nhim."

Yes, he\nwas Mistborn; only a man such as he could walk into an enemy palace,\ncompletely surrounded by guards, and not be the slightest bit unsettled.\n\"All right,\" Elend said, finally stepping into the room. \"Straff's man.\nYou bring a message for me?\"\n\"Not just a message, Your Majesty,\" the Watcher said. \"My name is\nZane, and I am something of an. . .ambassador.

Her thoughts were far less serene.\nWho else would he work for? she thought. Of course he's one of\nStraff's men.\nThat explained many things.

No need to worry him yet—he has enough\ntroubles at the moment.\"\nOreSeur sat back on his haunches. \"I see.\"\n\"You don't believe I'm right?\"\n\"I believe as I wish,\" OreSeur said. \"Isn't that what you just\ncommanded me, Mistress?\"\n\"Whatever,\" Vin said. Her bronze was on, and she had to try very hard\nnot to think about the mist spirit. She could feel it waiting in the darkness to\nher right. She didn't look toward it.\nThe logbook never did mention what became of that spirit. It nearly\nkilled one of the Hero's companions. After that, there was barely a mention\nof it.\nProblems for another night, she thought as another source of\nAllomancy appeared to her bronze senses. A stronger, more familiar source.\nZane.\nVin hopped up onto the battlements, nodded farewell to OreSeur, then\njumped out into the night.\nMist twisted in the sky, different breezes forming silent streams of\nwhite, like rivers in the air. Vin skimmed them, burst through them, and\nrode them like a bouncing stone cast upon the waters. She quickly reached\nthe place where she and Zane had last parted, the lonely abandoned street.\nHe waited in the center, still wearing black. Vin dropped to the cobbles\nbefore him in a flurry of mistcloak tassels. She stood up straight.\nHe never wears a cloak. Why is that?"

Why is that?\nThe two stood opposite one another for a few silent moments. Zane\nhad to know of her questions, but he offered no introduction, greeting, or\nexplanation. Eventually, he reached into a pocket and pulled out a coin. He\ntossed it to the street between them, and it bounced—metal ringing against\nstone—and came to a stop.\nHe jumped into the air. Vin did likewise, both Pushing against the coin.\nTheir separate weights nearly canceled each other out, and they shot up and\nback, like the two arms of a \"V.\"\nZane spun, throwing a coin behind him. It slammed against the side of\na building and he Pushed, throwing himself toward Vin. Suddenly, she felt a\nforce slam against her coin pouch, threatening to toss her back down to the\nground.\nWhat is the game tonight, Zane? she thought even as she yanked the tie\non her pouch, dropping it free from her belt. She Pushed against it, and it\nshot downward, forced by her weight. When it hit the ground, Vin had the\nbetter upward force: she was Pushing against the pouch from directly\nabove, while Zane was only pushing from the side. Vin lurched upward,\nstreaking past Zane in the cool night air, then threw her weight against the\ncoins in his own pocket.\nZane began to drop. However, he grabbed the coins—keeping them\nfrom ripping free—and Pushed down on her pouch. He froze in the air—\nVin Pushing him from above, his own Push forcing him upward. And,\nbecause he stopped, Vin's Push suddenly threw her backward.\nVin let go of Zane and allowed herself to drop. Zane, however, didn't\nlet himself fall. He Pushed himself back up into the air, then began to bound\naway, never letting his feet touch rooftops or cobblestones.\nHe tried to force me to the ground, Vin thought. First one to fall loses,\nis that it? Still tumbling, Vin spun herself in the air. She retrieved her coin\npouch with a careful Pull, then threw it down toward the ground and Pushed\nherself upward.\nShe Pulled the pouch back into her hand even as she flew, then jumped\nafter Zane, Pushing recklessly through the night, trying to catch up. In the\ndarkness, Luthadel seemed cleaner than it did during the day. She couldn't\nsee the ash-stained buildings, the dark refineries, the haze of smoke from\nthe forges. Around her, the empty keeps of the old high nobility watched\nlike silent monoliths. Some of the majestic buildings had been given to\nlesser nobles, and others had become government buildings. The rest—after\nbeing plundered at Elend's command—lay unused, their stained-glass\nwindows dark, their vaultings, statues, and murals ignored.\nVin wasn't certain if Zane purposely headed to Keep Hasting, or if she\nsimply caught up to him there. Either way, the enormous structure loomed\nas Zane noticed her proximity and turned, throwing a handful of coins at\nher.\nVin Pushed against them tentatively. Sure enough, as soon as she"

Sure enough, as soon as she\ntouched them, Zane flared steel and Pushed harder. If she'd been Pushing\nhard, the force of his attack would have thrown her backward. As it was,\nshe was able to deflect the coins to her sides.\nZane immediately Pushed against her coin pouch again, throwing\nhimself upward along one of Keep Hasting's walls. Vin was ready for this\nmove as well. Flaring pewter, she grabbed the pouch in a two-handed grip\nand ripped it in half.\nCoins sprayed beneath her, shooting toward the ground under the force\nof Zane's Push. She selected one and Pushed herself, gaining lift as soon as\nit hit the ground. She spun, facing upward, her tin-enhanced ears hearing a\nshower of metal hit the stones far below. She'd still have access to the coins,\nbut she didn't have to carry them on her body.\nShe shot up toward Zane, one of the keep's outer towers looming in the\nmists to her left. Keep Hasting was one of the finest in the city. It had a\nlarge tower at the center—tall, imposing, wide—with a ballroom at the very\ntop. It also had six smaller towers rising equidistant around the central\nstructure, each one connected to it by a thick wall. It was an elegant,\nmajestic building. Somehow, she suspected that Zane had sought it out for\nthat reason.\nVin watched him now, his Push losing power as he got too far from the\ncoin anchor below. He spun directly above her, a dark figure against a\nshifting sky of mist, still well below the top of the wall. Vin yanked sharply\non several coins below, Pulling them into the air in case she needed them.\nZane plummeted toward her. Vin reflexively Pushed against the coins\nin his pocket, then realized that was probably what he'd wanted: it gave him\nlift while forcing her down. She let go as she fell, and she soon passed the\ngroup of coins she'd Pulled into the air. She Pulled on one, bringing it into\nher hand, then Pushed on another, sending it sideways into the wall.\nVin shot to the side. Zane whooshed by her in the air, his passing\nchurning the mists. He soon bobbed back up—probably using a coin from\nbelow—and flung a double handful of coins straight at her.\nVin spun, again deflecting the coins. They shot around her, and she\nheard several pling against something in the mists behind her. Another wall.\nShe and Zane were sparring between a pair of the keep's outer towers; there\nwas an angled wall to either side of them, with the central tower just a short\ndistance in front of them. They were fighting near the tip of an open-\nbottomed triangle of stone walls.\nZane shot toward her. Vin reached out to throw her weight against him,\nbut realized with a start that he was no longer carrying any coins. He was\nPushing on something behind him, though—the same coin Vin had\nslammed against the wall with her weight. She Pushed herself upward,\ntrying to get out of the way, but he angled upward as well."

She Pushed herself upward,\ntrying to get out of the way, but he angled upward as well.\nZane crashed into her, and they began to fall. As they spun together,\nZane grabbed her by the upper arms, holding his face close to hers. He\ndidn't seem angry, or even very forceful.\nHe just seemed calm.\n\"This is what we are, Vin,\" he said quietly. Wind and mist whipped\naround them as they fell, the tassels of Vin's mistcloak writhing in the air\naround Zane. \"Why do you play their games? Why do you let them control\nyou?\"\nVin placed her hand lightly against Zane's chest, then Pushed on the\ncoin that had been in her palm. The force of the Push lurched her free of his\ngrip, flipping him up and backward. She caught herself just a few feet from\nthe ground, Pushing against fallen coins, throwing herself upward again.\nShe passed Zane in the night, and saw a smile on his face as he fell.\nVin reached downward, locking on to the blue lines extending toward the\nground far below, then flared iron and Pulled against all of them at once.\nBlue lines zipped around her, the coins rising and rising shooting past the\nsurprised Zane.\nShe Pulled a few choice coins into her hands. Let's see if you can stay\nin the air now, Vin thought with a smile, Pushing outward, spraying the\nother coins away into the night. Zane continued to fall.\nVin began to fall as well. She threw a coin to each side, then Pushed.\nThe coins shot into the mists, flying toward the stone walls to either side.\nCoins slapped against stone, and Vin lurched to a halt in the air.\nShe Pushed hard, holding herself in place, anticipating a Pull from\nbelow. If he pulls, I Pull, too, she thought. We both fall, and I keep the coins\nbetween us in the air. He'll hit the ground first.\nA coin shot past her in the air.\nWhat! Where did he get that! She'd been sure that she'd Pushed away\nevery coin below.\nThe coin arced upward, through the mists, trailing a blue line visible to\nher Allomancer's eyes. It crested the top of the wall to her right. Vin glanced\ndown just in time to see Zane slow, then lurch upward—Pulling on the coin\nthat was now held in place atop the wall by the stone railing.\nHe passed her with a self-satisfied look on his face.\nShow-off.\nVin let go of the coin to her left while still Pushing to her right. She\nlurched to the left, nearly colliding with the wall before she threw another\ncoin at it. She Pushed on this one, throwing herself upward and to the right.\nAnother coin sent her back upward to the left, and she continued to bounce\nbetween the walls, back and forth, until she crested the top.\nShe smiled as she twisted in the air. Zane—hovering in the air above\nthe wall's top—nodded appreciatively as she passed. She noticed that he'd\ngrabbed a few of her discarded coins.\nTime for a little attack myself, Vin thought."

She noticed that he'd\ngrabbed a few of her discarded coins.\nTime for a little attack myself, Vin thought.\nShe slammed a Push against the coins in Zane's hand, and they shot\nher upward. However, Zane was still Pushing against the coin on the wall\ntop below, and so he didn't fall. Instead he hung in the air between the two\nforces—his own Push forcing him upward, Vin's Push forcing him\ndownward.\nVin heard him grunt in exertion, and she Pushed harder. She was so\nfocused, however, that she barely saw him open his other hand and Push a\ncoin up toward her. She reached out to Push against it, but fortunately his\naim was off, and the coin missed her by a few inches.\nOr perhaps it didn't. Immediately, the coin zipped back downward and\nhit her in the back. Zane Pulled on it forcefully, and the bit of metal dug\ninto Vin's skin. She gasped, flaring pewter to keep the coin from cutting\nthrough her.\nZane didn't relent. Vin gritted her teeth, but he weighed much more\nthan she did. She inched down toward him in the night, her Push straining\nto keep the two of them apart, the coin digging painfully into her back.\nNever get into a raw Pushing match, Vin, Kelsier had warned her. You\ndon't weigh enough—you'll lose every time.\nShe stopped Pushing on the coin in Zane's hand. Immediately, she fell,\nPulled by the coin on her back. She Pushed on it slightly, giving herself a\nlittle leverage, then threw her final coin to the side. It hit at the last moment,\nand Vin's Push scooted her out from between Zane and his coin.\nZane's coin snapped him in the chest, and he grunted: he had obviously\nbeen trying to get Vin to collide with him again. Vin smiled, then Pulled\nagainst the coin in Zane's hand.\nGive him what he wants, I guess.\nHe turned just in time to see her slam feet-first into him. Vin spun,\nfeeling him crumple beneath her. She exulted in the victory, spinning in the\nair above the wall walk. Then she noticed something: several faint lines of\nblue disappearing into the distance. Zane had pushed all of their coins away.\nDesperately, Vin grabbed one of the coins and Pulled it back. Too late,\nhowever. She searched frantically for a closer source of metal, but all was\nstone or wood. Disoriented, she hit the stone wall walk, tumbling amid her\nmistcloak until she came to a halt beside the wall's stone railing.\nShe shook her head and flared tin, clearing her vision with a flash of\npain and other senses. Surely Zane hadn't fared better. He must have fallen\nas—\nZane hung a few feet away. He'd found a coin—Vin couldn't fathom\nhow—and was Pushing against it below him. However, he didn't shoot\naway. He hovered above the wall top, just a few feet in the air, still in a half\ntumble from Vin's kick.\nAs Vin watched, Zane rotated slowly in the air, hand outstretched\nbeneath him, twisting like a skilled acrobat on a pole.

There was a look of\nintense concentration on his face, and his muscles—all of them, arms, face,\nchest—were taut. He turned in the air until he was facing her.\nVin watched with awe. It was possible to Push just slightly against a\ncoin, regulating the amount of force with which one was thrown backward.\nIt was incredibly difficult, however—so difficult that even Kelsier had\nstruggled with it. Most of the time, Mistborn simply used short bursts.\nWhen Vin fell, for instance, she slowed herself by throwing a coin and\nPushing against it briefly—but powerfully—to counteract her momentum.\nShe'd never seen an Allomancer with as much control as Zane. His\nability to push slightly against that coin would be of little use in a fight; it\nobviously took too much concentration. Yet, there was a grace to it, a\nbeauty to his movements that implied something Vin herself had felt.\nAllomancy wasn't just about fighting and killing. It was about skill and\ngrace. It was something beautiful.\nZane rotated until he was upright, standing in a gentleman's posture.\nThen he dropped to the wall walk, his feet slapping quietly against the\nstones. He regarded Vin—who still lay on the stones—with a look that\nlacked contempt.\n\"You are very skilled,\" he said. \"And quite powerful.\"\nHe was tall, impressive. Like. . .Kelsier. \"Why did you come to the\npalace today?\" she asked, climbing to her feet.\n\"To see how they treated you. Tell me, Vin. What is it about Mistborn\nthat makes us—despite our powers—so willing to act as slaves to others?\"\n\"Slaves?\" Vin said. \"I'm no slave.\"\nZane shook his head. \"They use you, Vin.\"\n\"Sometimes it's good to be useful.\"\n\"Those words are spoken of insecurity.\"\nVin paused; then she eyed him. \"Where did you get that coin, at the\nend? There were none nearby.\"\nZane smiled, then opened his mouth and pulled out a coin. He dropped\nit to the stones with a pling. Vin opened her eyes wide. Metal inside a\nperson's body can't be affected by another Allomancer. . .. That's such an\neasy trick! Why didn't I think of it?\nWhy didn't Kelsier think of it?\nZane shook his head. \"We don't belong with them, Vin. We don't\nbelong in their world. We belong here, in the mists.\"\n\"I belong with those who love me,\" Vin said.\n\"Love you?\" Zane asked quietly. \"Tell me. Do they understand you,\nVin? Can they understand you? And, can a man love something he doesn't\nunderstand?\"\nHe watched her for a moment. When she didn't respond, he nodded to\nher slightly, then Pushed against the coin he had dropped moments before,\nthrowing himself back into the mists.\nVin let him go. His words held more weight than he probably\nunderstood. We don't belong in their world. . .. He couldn't know that she'd\nbeen pondering her place, wondering whether she was noblewoman,"

He couldn't know that she'd\nbeen pondering her place, wondering whether she was noblewoman,\nassassin, or something else.\nZane's words, then, meant something important. He felt himself to be\nan outsider. A little like herself. It was a weakness in him, certainly. Perhaps\nshe could turn him against Straff—his willingness to spar with her, his\nwillingness to reveal himself, hinted at that much.\nShe breathed in deeply of the cool, mist air, her heart still beating\nquickly from the exchange. She felt tired, yet alive, from fighting someone\nwho might actually be better than she was. Standing in the mists atop the\nwall of an abandoned keep, she decided something.\nShe had to keep sparring with Zane.\nIf only the Deepness hadn't come when it did, providing a threat that\ndrove men to desperation both in action and belief.\n18\n\"KILL HIM,\" GOD WHISPERED.\nZane hung quietly in the mists, looking through Elend Venture's open\nbalcony doors. The mists swirled around him, obscuring him from the\nking's view.\n\"You should kill him,\" God said again.\nIn a way, Zane hated Elend, though he had never met the man before\ntoday. Elend was everything that Zane should have been. Favored.\nPrivileged. Pampered. He was Zane's enemy, a block in the road to\ndomination, the thing that was keeping Straff—and therefore Zane—from\nruling the Central Dominance.\nBut he was also Zane's brother.\nZane let himself drop through the mists, falling silently to the ground\noutside Keep Venture. He Pulled his anchors up into his hand—three small\nbars he had been pushing on to hold himself in place. Vin would be\nreturning soon, and he didn't want to be near the keep when she did. She\nhad a strange ability to know where he was; her senses were far more keen\nthan any Allomancer he had ever known or fought. Of course, she had been\ntrained by the Survivor himself.\nI would have liked to have known him, Zane thought as he moved\nquietly across the courtyard. He was a man who understood the power of\nbeing Mistborn. A man who didn't let others control him.\nA man who did what had to be done, no matter how ruthless it seemed.\nOr so the rumors said.\nZane paused beside the outer keep wall, below a buttress. He stooped,\nremoving a cobblestone, and found the message left there by his spy inside\nElend's palace. Zane retrieved it, replaced the cobblestone, then dropped a\ncoin and launched himself out into the night.\nZane did not slink. Nor did he creep, skulk, or cower. In fact, he didn't\neven like to hide.\nSo, he approached the Venture army camp with a determined stride. It\nseemed to him that Mistborn spent too much of their existence hiding. True,\nanonymity offered some limited freedom. However, his experience had\nbeen that it bound them more than it freed them. It let them be controlled,\nand it let society pretend that they didn't exist."

It let them be controlled,\nand it let society pretend that they didn't exist.\nZane strode toward a guard post, where two soldiers sat beside a large\nfire. He shook his head; they were virtually useless, blinded by the firelight.\nNormal men feared the mists, and that made them less valuable. That wasn't\narrogance; it was a simple fact. Allomancers were more useful, and\ntherefore more valuable, than normal men. That was why Zane had Tineyes\nwatching in the darkness as well. These regular soldiers were more a\nformality than anything else.\n\"Kill them,\" God commanded as Zane walked up to the guard post.\nZane ignored the voice, though it was growing more and more difficult to\ndo so.\n\"Halt!\" one of the guards said, lowering a spear. \"Who is that?\"\nZane Pushed the spear offhandedly, flipping up the tip. \"Who else\nwould it be?\" he snapped, walking into the firelight.\n\"Lord Zane!\" the other soldier said.\n\"Summon the king,\" Zane said, passing the guard post. \"Tell him to\nmeet me in the command tent.\"\n\"But, my lord,\" the guard said. \"The hour is late. His Majesty is\nprobably. . .\"\nZane turned, giving the guard a flat stare. The mists swirled between\nthem. Zane didn't even have to use emotional Allomancy on the soldier; the\nman simply saluted, then rushed off into the night to do as commanded.\nZane strode through the camp. He wore no uniform or mistcloak, but\nsoldiers stopped and saluted as he passed. This was the way it should be.\nThey knew him, knew what he was, knew to respect him.\nAnd yet, a part of him acknowledged that if Straff hadn't kept his\nbastard son hidden, Zane might not be the powerful weapon that he was\ntoday. That secrecy had forced Zane to live a life of near squalor while his\nhalf brother, Elend, had been privileged. But it also meant that Straff had\nbeen able to keep Zane hidden for most of his life. Even still, while rumors\nwere growing about the existence of Straff's Mistborn, few realized that\nZane was Straff's son.\nPlus, living a harsh life had taught Zane to survive on his own. He had\nbecome hard, and powerful. Things he suspected Elend would never\nunderstand. Unfortunately, one side effect of his childhood was that it had\napparently driven him mad.\n\"Kill him,\" God whispered as Zane passed another guard. The voice\nspoke every time he saw a person—it was Zane's quiet, constant\ncompanion. He understood that he was insane. It hadn't really been all that\nhard to determine, all things considered. Normal people did not hear voices.\nZane did.\nHe found insanity no excuse, however, for irrational behavior. Some\nmen were blind, others had poor tempers. Still others heard voices. It was\nall the same, in the end. A man was defined not by his flaws, but by how he\novercame them.\nAnd so, Zane ignored the voice. He killed when he wanted to, not"

In his estimation, he was actually quite lucky. Other\nmadmen saw visions, or couldn't distinguish their delusions from reality.\nZane, at least, could control himself.\nFor the most part.\nHe Pushed on the metal clasps on the flaps of the command tent. The\nflaps flipped backward, opening for him as the soldiers to either side\nsaluted. Zane ducked inside.\n\"My lord!\" said the nightwatch officer of command.\n\"Kill him,\" God said. \"He's really not that important.\"\n\"Paper,\" Zane ordered, walking to the room's large table. The officer\nscrambled to comply, grabbing a stack of sheets. Zane Pulled on the nib of a\npen, flipping it across the room to his waiting hand. The officer brought the\nink.\n\"These are troop concentrations and night patrols,\" Zane said,\nscribbling down some numbers and diagrams on the paper. \"I observed\nthem tonight, while I was in Luthadel.\"\n\"Very good, my lord,\" the soldier said. \"We appreciate your help.\"\nZane paused. Then he slowly continued to write. \"Soldier, you are not\nmy superior. You aren't even my equal. I am not 'helping' you. I am seeing\nto the needs of my army. Do you understand?\"\n\"Of course, my lord.\"\n\"Good,\" Zane said, finishing his notes and handing the paper to the\nsoldier. \"Now, leave—or I'll do as a friend has suggested and ram this pen\nthrough your throat.\"\nThe soldier accepted the paper, then quickly withdrew. Zane waited\nimpatiently. Straff did not arrive. Finally, Zane cursed quietly and Pushed\nopen the tent flaps and strode out. Straff's tent was a blazing red beacon in\nthe night, well lit by numerous lanterns. Zane passed the guards, who knew\nbetter than to bother him, and entered the king's tent.\nStraff was having a late dinner. He was a tall man, brown of hair like\nboth his sons—the two important ones, at least. He had fine nobleman's\nhands, which he used to eat with finesse. He didn't react as Zane entered.\n\"You're late,\" Straff said.\n\"Kill him,\" God said.\nZane clinched his fists. This command from the voice was the hardest\nto ignore. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm late.\"\n\"What happened tonight?\" Straff asked.\nZane glanced at the servants. \"We should do this in the command tent.\"\nStraff continued to sip his soup, staying where he was, implying that\nZane had no power to order him about. It was frustrating, but not\nunexpected. Zane had used virtually the same tactic on the nightwatch\nofficer just moments before. He had learned from the best.\nFinally, Zane sighed, taking a seat. He rested his arms on the table, idly\nspinning a dinner knife as he watched his father eat. A servant approached\nto ask Zane if he wanted a meal, but he waved the man away.\n\"Kill Straff,\" God commanded. \"You should be in his place. You are"

He really was competent; because of him,\nthe Northern Dominance had avoided the chaos that prevailed in the rest of\nthe Final Empire. Straff's skaa remained under control, his noblemen\nquelled. True, he had been forced to execute a number of people to prove\nthat he was in charge. But, he did what needed to be done. That was one\nattribute in a man that Zane respected above all others.\nEspecially since he had trouble displaying it himself.\n\"Kill him!\" God yelled. \"You hate him! He kept you in squalor, forcing\nyou to fight for your survival as a child.\"\nHe made me strong, Zane thought.\n\"Then use that strength to kill him!\"\nZane grabbed the carving knife off the table. Straff looked up from his\nmeal, then flinched just slightly as Zane sliced the flesh of his own arm. He\ncut a long gash into the top of his forearm, drawing blood. The pain helped\nhim resist the voice.\nStraff watched for a moment, then waved for a servant to bring Zane a\ntowel so he wouldn't get blood on the rug.\n\"You need to get her to use atium again,\" Straff said. \"Elend may have\nbeen able to gather one or two beads. We'll only know the truth if she runs\nout.\" He paused, turning back to his meal. \"Actually, what you need to do is\nget her to tell you where the stash is hidden, if they even have it.\"\nZane sat, watching the blood seep from the gash on his forearm. \"She's\nmore capable than you think, Father.\"\nStraff raised an eyebrow. \"Don't tell me you believe those stories,\nZane? The lies about her and the Lord Ruler?\"\n\"How do you know they are lies?\"\n\"Because of Elend,\" Straff said. \"That boy is a fool; he only controls\nLuthadel because every nobleman with half a wit in his head fled the city. If\nthat girl were powerful enough to defeat the Lord Ruler, I sincerely doubt\nthat your brother could ever have gained her loyalty.\"\nZane cut another slice in his arm. He didn't cut deeply enough to do\nany real damage, and the pain worked as it usually did. Straff finally turned\nfrom his meal, masking a look of discomfort. A small, twisted piece of Zane\ntook pleasure from seeing that look in his father's eyes. Perhaps it was a\nside effect of his insanity.\n\"Anyway,\" Straff said, \"did you meet with Elend?\"\nZane nodded.

He wanted to meet with you, but he\nobviously didn't like the idea of coming into your camp. I doubt he'll\ncome.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Straff said. \"But, don't underestimate the boy's foolishness.\nEither way, perhaps now he understands how our relationship will proceed.\"\nSo much posturing, Zane thought. By sending this message, Straff took\na stand: he wouldn't be ordered about, or even inconvenienced, on Elend's\nbehalf.\nBeing forced into a siege inconvenienced you, though, Zane thought\nwith a smile. What Straff would have liked to do was attack directly, taking\nthe city without parlay or negotiations. The arrival of the second army made\nthat impossible. Attack now, and Straff would be defeated by Cett.\nThat meant waiting, waiting in a siege, until Elend saw reason and\njoined with his father willingly. But, waiting was something Straff disliked.\nZane didn't mind as much. It would give him more time to spar with the\ngirl. He smiled.\nAs the tea arrived, Zane closed his eyes, then burned tin to enhance his\nsenses. His wounds burst to life, minor pains becoming great, shocking him\nto wakefulness.\nThere was a part of all this he wasn't telling Straff. She is coming to\ntrust me, he thought. And there's something else about her. She's like me.\nPerhaps. . .she could understand me.\nPerhaps she could save me.\nHe sighed, opening his eyes and using the towel to clean his arm. His\ninsanity frightened him sometimes. But, it seemed weaker around Vin. That\nwas all he had to go on for the moment. He accepted his tea from the\nserving girl—long braid, firm chest, homely features—and took a sip of the\nhot cinnamon.\nStraff raised his own cup, then hesitated, sniffing delicately. He eyed\nZane. \"Poisoned tea, Zane?\"\nZane said nothing.\n\"Birchbane, too,\" Straff noted. \"That's a depressingly unoriginal move\nfor you.\"\nZane said nothing.\nStraff made a cutting motion. The girl looked up with terror as one of\nStraff's guards stepped toward her. She glanced at Zane, expecting some\nsort of aid, but he just looked away. She yelled pathetically as the guard\npulled her off to be executed.\nShe wanted the chance to kill him, he thought. I told her it probably\nwouldn't work.\nStraff just shook his head. Though not a full Mistborn, the king was a\nTineye. Still, even for one with such an ability, sniffing birchbane amid the\ncinnamon was an impressive feat.\n\"Zane, Zane. . .\" Straff said. \"What would you do if you actually\nmanaged to kill me?\"\nIf I actually wanted to kill you, Zane thought, I'd use that knife, not\npoison. But, he let Straff think what he wished. The king expected\nassassination attempts. So Zane provided them.\nStraff held something up—a small bead of atium. \"I was going to give"

So Zane provided them.\nStraff held something up—a small bead of atium. \"I was going to give\nyou this, Zane. But I see that we'll have to wait. You need to get over these\nfoolish attempts on my life. If you were ever to succeed, where would you\nget your atium?\"\nStraff didn't understand, of course. He thought that atium was like a\ndrug, and assumed that Mistborn relished using it. Therefore, he thought he\ncould control Zane with it. Zane let the man continue in his\nmisapprehension, never explaining that he had his own personal stockpile\nof the metal.\nThat, however, brought him to face the real question that dominated\nhis life. God's whispers were returning, now that the pain was fading. And,\nof all the people the voice whispered about, Straff Venture was the one who\nmost deserved to die.\n\"Why?\" God asked. \"Why won't you kill him?\"\nZane looked down at his feet. Because he's my father, he thought,\nfinally admitting his weakness. Other men did what they had to. They were\nstronger than Zane.\n\"You're insane, Zane,\" Straff said.\nZane looked up.\n\"Do you really think you could conquer the empire yourself, if you\nwere to kill me? Considering your. . .particular malady, do you think you\ncould run even a city?\"\nZane looked away. \"No.\"\nStraff nodded. \"I'm glad we both understand that.\"\n\"You should just attack,\" Zane said. \"We can find the atium once we\ncontrol Luthadel.\"\nStraff smiled, then sipped the tea. The poisoned tea.\nDespite himself, Zane started, sitting up straight.\n\"Don't presume to think you know what I'm planning, Zane,\" Straff\nsaid. \"You don't understand half as much as you assume.\"\nZane sat quietly, watching his father drink the last of the tea.\n\"What of your spy?\" Straff asked.\nZane lay the note on the table. \"He's worried that they might suspect\nhim. He has found no information about the atium.\"\nStraff nodded, setting down the empty cup. \"You'll return to the city\nand continue to befriend the girl.\"\nZane nodded slowly, then turned and left the tent.\nStraff thought he could feel the birchbane already, seeping through his\nveins, making him tremble. He forced himself to remain in control. Waiting\nfor a few moments.\nOnce he was sure Zane was distant, he called for a guard. \"Bring me\nAmaranta!\" Straff ordered. \"Quickly!\"\nThe soldier rushed to do his master's bidding. Straff sat quietly, tent\nrustling in the evening breeze, a puff of mist floating to the floor from the\nonce open flap. He burned tin, enhancing his senses. Yes. . .he could feel the\npoison within him. Deadening his nerves. He had time, however.

Fortunately, Straff had a tool even Zane didn't\nknow about—one that came in the form of a woman. Straff smiled as his\ntin-enhanced ears heard soft footsteps approaching in the night.\nThe soldiers sent Amaranta right in. Straff hadn't brought all of his\nmistresses with him on the trip—just his ten or fifteen favorites. Mixed in\nwith the ones he was currently bedding, however, were some women that he\nkept for their effectiveness rather than their beauty. Amaranta was a good\nexample. She had been quite attractive a decade before, but now she was\ncreeping up into her late twenties. Her breasts had begun to sag from\nchildbirth, and every time Straff looked at her, he noticed the wrinkles that\nwere appearing on her forehead and around her eyes. He got rid of most\nwomen long before they reached her age.\nThis one, however, had skills that were useful. If Zane heard that Straff\nhad sent for the woman this night, he'd assume that Straff had simply\nwanted to bed her. He'd be wrong.\n\"My lord,\" Amaranta said, getting down on her knees. She began to\ndisrobe.\nWell, at least she's optimistic, Straff thought. He would have thought\nthat after four years without being called to his bed, she would understand.\nDidn't women realize when they were too old to be attractive?\n\"Keep your clothing on, woman,\" he snapped.\nAmaranta's face fell, and she laid her hands in her lap, leaving her\ndress half undone, one breast exposed—as if she were trying to tempt him\nwith her aging nudity.\n\"I need your antidote,\" he said. \"Quickly.\"\n\"Which one, my lord?\" she asked. She wasn't the only herbalist Straff\nkept; he learned scents and tastes from four different people. Amaranta,\nhowever, was the best of them.\n\"Birchbane,\" Straff said. \"And. . .maybe something else. I'm not sure.\"\n\"Another general potion, then, my lord?\" Amaranta asked.\nStraff nodded curtly. Amaranta rose, walking to his poison cabinet. She\nlit the burner at the side, boiling a small pot of water as she quickly mixed\npowders, herbs, and liquids. The concoction was her particular specialty—a\nmixture of all of the basic poison antidotes, remedies, and reagents in her\nrepertoire. Straff suspected that Zane had used the birchbane to cover\nsomething else. Whatever it was, however, Amaranta's concoction would\ndeal with—or at least identify—it.\nStraff waited uncomfortably as Amaranta worked, still half naked. The\nconcoction needed to be prepared freshly each time, but it was worth the\nwait. She eventually brought him a steaming mug. Straff gulped it, forcing\ndown the harsh liquid despite its bitterness. Immediately, he began to feel\nbetter.\nHe sighed—another trap avoided—as he drank the rest of the cup to be\ncertain. Amaranta knelt expectantly again.\n\"Go,\" Straff ordered.\nAmaranta nodded quietly. She put her arm back through the dress's\nsleeve, then retreated from the tent."

As long as he appeared strong before Zane, the Mistborn would\ncontinue to do as commanded.\nProbably.\nIf only I had passed over Alendi when looking for an assistant, all\nthose years ago.\n19\nSAZED UNCLASPED HIS FINAL STEELMIND. He held it up, the\nbraceletlike band of metal glistening in the red sunlight. To another man, it\nmight seem valuable. To Sazed, it was now just another empty husk—a\nsimple steel bracelet. He could refill it if he wished, but for the moment he\ndidn't consider the weight worth carrying.\nWith a sigh, he dropped the bracelet. It fell with a clank, tossing up a\npuff of ash from the ground. Five months of storing, of spending every fifth\nday drained of speed, my body moving as if impeded by a thick molasses.\nAnd now it's all gone.\nThe loss had purchased something valuable, however. In just six days\nof travel, using steelminds on occasion, he had traveled the equivalent of\nsix weeks' worth of walking. According to his cartography coppermind,\nLuthadel was now a little over a week away. Sazed felt good about the\nexpenditure. Perhaps he'd overreacted to the deaths he'd found in the little\nsouthern village. Perhaps there was no need for him to hurry. But, he'd\ncreated the steelmind to be used.\nHe hefted his pack, which was much lighter than it had been. Though\nmany of his metalminds were small, they were heavy in aggregate. He'd\ndecided to discard some of the less valuable or less full ones as he ran. Just\nlike the steel bracelet, which he left sitting in the ash behind him as he went\non.\nHe was definitely in the Central Dominance now. He'd passed Faleast\nand Tyrian, two of the northern Ashmounts. Tyrian was still just barely\nvisible to the south—a tall, solitary peak with a cut-off, blackened top. The\nlandscape had grown flat, the trees changing from patchy brown pines to the\nwillowy white aspens common around Luthadel. The aspens rose like bones\ngrowing from the black soil, clumping, their ashen white bark scarred and\ntwisted. They—\nSazed paused. He stood near the central canal, one of the main routes\nto Luthadel. The canal was empty of boats at the moment; travelers were\nrare these days, even more rare than they had been during the Final Empire,\nfor bandits were far more common. Sazed had outrun several groups of\nthem during his hurried flight to Luthadel.\nNo, solitary travelers were rare.

It was midday; if that army had scouts, Sazed would have a\nvery difficult time getting around it. In addition, his steelminds were empty.\nHe wouldn't be able to run from pursuit.\nAnd yet, an army within a week of Luthadel. . .. Whose was it, and\nwhat threat did it pose? His curiosity, the curiosity of a scholar, prodded\nhim to seek a vantage from which to study the troops. Vin and the others\ncould use any information he gathered.\nDecision made, Sazed located a hill with a particularly large stand of\naspens. He dropped his pack at the base of a tree, then pulled out an\nironmind and began to fill it. He felt the familiar sensation of decreased\nweight, and he easily climbed to the top of the thin tree—his body was now\nlight enough that it didn't take much strength to pull himself upward.\nHanging from the very tip of the tree, Sazed tapped his tinmind. The\nedges of his vision fuzzed, as always, but with the increased vision he could\nmake out details about the large group settled into a hollow before him.\nHe was right about it being an army. He was wrong about it being\nmade up of men.\n\"By the forgotten gods. . .\" Sazed whispered, so shocked that he nearly\nlost his grip. The army was organized in only the most simplistic and\nprimitive way. There were no tents, no vehicles, no horses. Just hundreds of\nlarge cooking fires, each ringed with figures.\nAnd those figures were of a deep blue. They varied greatly in size;\nsome were just five feet tall, others were lumbering hulks of ten feet or\nmore. They were both the same species, Sazed knew. Koloss. The creatures\n—though similar to men in base form—never stopped growing. They\nsimply continued to get bigger as they aged, growing until their hearts could\nno longer support them. Then they died, killed by their body's own growth\nimperative.\nBefore they died, however, they got very large. And very dangerous.\nSazed dropped from the tree, making his body light enough that he hit\nthe ground softly. He hurriedly searched through his copperminds. When he\nfound the one he wanted, he strapped it to his upper left arm, then climbed\nback up the tree.\nHe searched an index quickly. Somewhere, he'd taken notes on a book\nabout the koloss—he'd studied it trying to decide if the creatures had a\nreligion. He'd had someone repeat the notes back to him, so he could store\nthem in the coppermind. He had the book memorized, too, of course, but\nplacing so much information directly in his mind would ruin the—\nThere, he thought, recovering the notes. He tapped them from the\ncoppermind, filling his mind with knowledge.\nMost koloss bodies gave out before they reached twenty years of age.\nThe more \"ancient\" creatures were often a massive twelve feet in height,\nwith stocky, powerful bodies. However, few koloss lived that long—and not\njust because of heart failure. Their society—if it could be called that—was\nextremely violent.\nExcitement suddenly overcoming apprehension, Sazed tapped tin for\nvision again, searching through the thousands of blue humanoids, trying to"

It wasn't hard to find fights. Scuffles\naround the fires seemed common, and, interestingly, they were always\nbetween koloss of nearly the same size. Sazed magnified his view even\nfurther—gripping the tree tightly to overcome the nausea—and got his first\ngood look at a koloss.\nIt was a creature of smaller size—perhaps six feet tall. It was man-\nshaped, with two arms and legs, though its neck was hard to distinguish. It\nwas completely bald. The oddest feature, however, was its blue skin, which\nhung loose and folded. The creature looked like a fat man might, had all his\nfat been drained away, leaving the stretched skin behind.\nAnd. . .the skin didn't seem to be connected very well. Around the\ncreature's red, blood-drop eyes, the skin sagged, revealing the facial\nmuscles. The same was true around the mouth: the skin sagged a few inches\nbelow the chin, the lower teeth and jaw completely exposed.\nIt was a stomach-turning sight, especially for a man who was already\nnauseated. The creature's ears hung low, flopping down beside its jawline.\nIts nose was formless and loose, with no cartilage supporting it. Skin hung\nbaggily from the creature's arms and legs, and its only clothing was a crude\nloincloth.\nSazed turned, selecting a larger creature—one perhaps eight feet tall—\nto study. The skin on this beast wasn't as loose, but it still didn't seem to fit\nquite right. Its nose twisted at a crooked angle, pulled flat against the face\nby an enlarged head that sat on a stumpy neck. The creature turned to leer at\na companion, and again, the skin around its mouth didn't quite fit: the lips\ndidn't close completely, and the holes around the eyes were too big, so they\nexposed the muscles beneath.\nLike. . .a person wearing a mask made of skin, Sazed thought, trying to\npush away his disgust. So. . .their body continues to grow, but their skin\ndoesn't?\nHis thought was confirmed as a massive, ten-foot-tall beast of a koloss\nwandered into the group. Smaller creatures scattered before this newcomer,\nwho thumped up to the fire, where several horses were roasting.\nThis largest creature's skin was pulled so tight it was beginning to tear.\nThe hairless blue flesh had ripped around the eyes, at the edges of the\nmouth, and around the massive chest muscles. Sazed could see little trails\nof red blood dripping from the rips. Even where the skin wasn't torn, it was\npulled taut—the nose and ears were so flat they were almost\nindistinguishable from the flesh around them.\nSuddenly, Sazed's study didn't seem so academic. Koloss had come to\nthe Central Dominance. Creatures so violent and uncontrollable that the\nLord Ruler had been forced to keep them away from civilization.

One problem with enhancing his vision was that he\ntemporarily lost the ability to see close up—so it wasn't odd that he hadn't\nnoticed the koloss patrol surrounding his aspens.\nBy the forgotten gods! He held firm to the tip of the tree, thinking\nquickly. Several koloss were already pushing their way into the stand. If he\ndropped to the ground, he'd be too slow to escape. As always, he wore a\npewtermind; he could easily become as strong as ten men, and maintain it\nfor a good amount of time. He could fight, perhaps. . ..\nYet, the koloss carried crude-looking, but massive, swords. Sazed's\nnotes, his memory, and his lore all agreed: Koloss were very dangerous\nwarriors. Strong as ten men or not, Sazed wouldn't have the skill to defeat\nthem.\n\"Come down,\" called a deep, slurred voice from below. \"Come down\nnow.\"\nSazed looked down. A large koloss, skin just beginning to stretch,\nstood at the tree's base. It gave the aspen a shake.\n\"Come down now,\" the creature repeated.\nThe lips don't work very well, Sazed thought. He sounds like a man\ntrying to talk without moving his lips. He wasn't surprised that the creature\ncould talk; his notes mentioned that. He was, however, surprised at how\ncalm it sounded.\nI could run, he thought. He could keep to the tops of trees, perhaps\ncross the distance between patches of aspens by dropping his metalminds\nand trying to ride gusts of wind. But it would be very difficult—and very\nunpredictable.\nAnd he would have to leave his copperminds—a thousand years of\nhistory—behind.\nSo, pewtermind ready in case he needed strength, Sazed let go of the\ntree. The koloss leader—Sazed could only assume that was what he was—\nwatched Sazed fall to the ground with a red-eyed stare. The creature did not\nblink. Sazed wondered if it even could blink, its skin stretched as it was.\nSazed plunked to the ground beside the tree, then reached for his pack.\n\"No,\" the koloss snapped, grabbing the pack with an inhumanly quick\nswipe of the arm. It tossed the pack to another koloss.\n\"I need that,\" Sazed said. \"I will be much more cooperative if—\"\n\"Quiet!\" the koloss yelled with a rage so sudden that Sazed took a step\nbackward. Terrismen were tall—especially Terrismen eunuchs—and it was\nvery disconcerting to be dwarfed by this beastly creature, well over nine\nfeet in height, its skin a blackish blue, its eyes the color of the sun at dusk.\nIt loomed over Sazed, and he cringed in spite of himself.\nApparently, that was the proper reaction, for the lead koloss nodded\nand turned away. \"Come,\" it slurred, lumbering through the small aspen\nforest.

He\nchose a god—Duis, a god once said to watch over wearied travelers—and\nsaid a quick, silent prayer. Then he hurried forward, staying with the pack\nof koloss as they walked toward the camp.\nAt least they didn't kill me out of hand, Sazed thought. He'd half\nexpected that, considering what he'd read. Of course, even the books didn't\nknow much. The koloss had been kept separate from mankind for centuries;\nthe Lord Ruler only called upon them in times of great martial need, to\nquell revolts, or to conquer new societies discovered on the inner islands. At\nthose times, the koloss had caused absolute destruction and slaughter—or\nso the histories claimed.\nCould all that have been propaganda? Sazed wondered. Maybe the\nkoloss aren't as violent as we assumed.\nOne of the koloss beside Sazed howled in sudden anger. Sazed spun as\nthe koloss jumped at one of its companions. The creature ignored the sword\non its back, instead punching his enemy's head with a blocky fist. The\nothers paused, turning to watch the fight, but none of them seemed alarmed.\nSazed watched with growing horror as the aggressor proceeded to\nrepeatedly pummel his enemy. The defender tried to protect himself, getting\nout a dagger and managing to score a cut on the aggressor's arm. The blue\nskin tore, seeping bright red blood, as the aggressor got his hands around\nhis opponent's thick head and twisted.\nThere was a snap. The defender stopped moving. The aggressor\nremoved the sword from his victim's back and strapped it on beside his own\nweapon, then removed a small pouch that was tied beside the sword. After\nthat, he stood, ignoring the wound on his arm, and the group began to walk\nagain.\n\"Why?\" Sazed asked, shocked. \"What was that for?\"\nThe wounded koloss turned around. \"I hated him,\" he said.\n\"Move!\" the lead koloss snapped at Sazed.\nSazed forced himself to start walking. They left the corpse lying in the\nroad. The pouches, he thought, trying to find something to focus on besides\nthe brutality. They all carry those pouches. The koloss kept them tied to\ntheir swords. They didn't carry the weapons in sheaths; they were simply\nbound on their backs with leather straps. And tied to those straps were\npouches. Sometimes there was just one, though the two largest creatures in\nthe group each had several.\nThey look like coin pouches, Sazed thought. But, the koloss don't have\nan economy. Perhaps they keep personal possessions in them? But what\nwould beasts like these value?\nThey entered the camp. There didn't appear to be sentries at the\nborders—but, then, why would guards be necessary? It would be very\ndifficult for a human to sneak into this camp.\nA group of smaller koloss—the five-foot-tall ones—rushed forward as\nsoon as the group arrived. The murderer threw his extra sword to one of\nthem, then pointed into the distance. He kept the pouch for himself, and the\nsmall ones rushed off, following the road in the direction of the body.\nBurial detail? Sazed wondered."

Sazed wondered.\nHe walked uncomfortably behind his captors as they penetrated into\nthe camp. Beasts of all sorts were being roasted over the firepits, though\nSazed didn't think any of them had once been human. In addition, the\nground around the camp had been completely stripped of plant life, as if it\nhad been grazed by a group of particularly aggressive goats.\nAnd, according to his coppermind, that wasn't far off the truth. Koloss\ncould, apparently, subsist on practically anything. They preferred meat, but\nwould eat any kind of plant—even grass, going so far as to pull it up by the\nroots to eat. Some reports even spoke of them eating dirt and ash, though\nSazed found that a little difficult to believe.\nHe continued to walk. The camp smelled of smoke, grime, and a\nstrange musk that he assumed was koloss body odor. Some of the creatures\nturned as he passed, watching him with steady red eyes.\nIt's like they only have two emotions, he thought, jumping as a fireside\nkoloss suddenly screamed and attacked a companion. They're either\nindifferent or they're enraged.\nWhat would it take to set them all off at once? And. . .what kind of a\ndisaster would they cause if that happened? He nervously revised his earlier\nthoughts. No, the koloss had not been maligned. The stories he had heard—\nstories of koloss running wild in the Farmost Dominance, causing\nwidespread destruction and death—were obviously true.\nBut something kept this group marginally reined in. The Lord Ruler\nhad been able to control the koloss, though no book explained how. Most\nwriters simply accepted this ability as part of what had made the Lord Ruler\nGod. The man had been immortal—compared with that, other powers\nseemed mundane.\nHis immortality, however, was a trick, Sazed thought. Simply a clever\ncombination of Feruchemical and Allomantic powers. The Lord Ruler had\nbeen just a normal man—albeit one with an unusual combination of\nabilities and opportunities.\nThat being the case, how had he controlled the koloss? There was\nsomething different about the Lord Ruler. Something more than his powers.\nHe did something at the Well of Ascension, something that forever changed\nthe world. Perhaps his ability to control the koloss came from that.\nSazed's captors ignored the occasional fights around firepits. There\ndidn't appear to be any female koloss in the camp—or, if there were, they\nwere indistinguishable from the males. Sazed did, however, notice a koloss\ncorpse lying forgotten near one of the fires. It had been flayed, the blue skin\nripped free.\nHow could any society exist like this? he thought with horror. His\nbooks said the koloss bred and aged quickly—a fortunate situation for\nthem, considering the number of deaths he had already seen. Even so, it\nseemed to him that this species killed too many of its members to continue.\nYet they did continue. Unfortunately.

However, the brutality of the koloss camp—the wounded\ncreatures who sat, ignoring the gashes in their skin, the flayed corpses along\nthe path, the sudden bellows of anger and subsequent murders—tested this\nbelief.\nHis captors led him around a small hillock in the land, and Sazed\npaused as he saw something very unexpected.\nA tent.\n\"Go,\" the lead koloss said, pointing.\nSazed frowned. There were several dozen humans outside the tent,\ncarrying spears and dressed like imperial guards. The tent was large, and\nbehind it stood a line of boxy carts.\n\"Go!\" the koloss yelled.\nSazed did as he was told. Behind him, one of the koloss indifferently\ntossed Sazed's pack toward the human guards. The metalminds inside\nclinked together as they hit the ashy ground, causing Sazed to cringe. The\nsoldiers watched the koloss retreat with a wary eye; then one picked up the\npack. Another leveled his spear at Sazed.\nSazed held up his hands. \"I am Sazed, a Keeper of Terris, once\nsteward, now teacher. I am not your enemy.\"\n\"Yes, well,\" the guard said, still watching the retreating koloss. \"You're\nstill going to have to come with me.\"\n\"May I have my possessions back?\" Sazed asked. This hollow\nappeared free of koloss; apparently, the human soldiers wanted to keep their\ndistance.\nThe first guard turned to his companion, who was perusing Sazed's\npack. The second guard looked up and shrugged. \"No weapons. Some\nbracelets and rings, maybe worth something.\"\n\"None of them are of precious metals,\" Sazed said. \"They are the tools\nof a Keeper, and are of little value to anyone but myself.\"\nThe second guard shrugged, handing the bag to the first man. Both\nwere of standard Central Dominance coloring—dark hair, light skin, the\nbuild and height of those who'd had proper nutrition as children. The first\nguard was the older of the two, and was obviously in charge. He took the\nbag from his companion. \"We'll see what His Majesty says.\"\nAh, Sazed thought. \"Let us speak with him then.\"\nThe guard turned, pushing aside the tent door and motioning for Sazed\nto enter. Sazed stepped from red sunlight into a functional—if sparsely\nfurnished—tent room. This main chamber was large, and contained several\nmore guards. Sazed had seen perhaps two dozen so far.\nThe lead guard walked forward and poked his head into a room at the\nback. A few moments later, he waved Sazed forward and pulled back the\ntent door.\nSazed entered the second chamber. The man inside wore the pants and\nsuit jacket of a Luthadel nobleman. He was balding—his hair reduced to a\nfew struggling wisps—despite his youth. He stood, tapping the side of his\nleg with a nervous hand, and jumped slightly when Sazed entered.\nSazed recognized the man. \"Jastes Lekal.\""

He stood, tapping the side of his\nleg with a nervous hand, and jumped slightly when Sazed entered.\nSazed recognized the man. \"Jastes Lekal.\"\n\"King Lekal,\" Jastes snapped. \"Do I know you, Terrisman?\"\n\"We have not met, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said, \"but I have had some\ndealings with a friend of yours, I think. King Elend Venture of Luthadel?\"\nJastes nodded absently. \"My men say the koloss brought you. They\nfound you poking around the camp?\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said carefully, watching as Jastes began to\npace. This man isn't much more stable than the army he apparently leads,\nhe thought with dissatisfaction. \"How is it that you have persuaded the\ncreatures to serve you?\"\n\"You are a prisoner, Terrisman,\" Jastes snapped. \"No questions. Did\nElend send you to spy on me?\"\n\"I was sent by no man,\" Sazed said. \"You happened to be in my path,\nYour Majesty. I meant no harm by my observations.\"\nJastes paused, eyeing Sazed, before beginning to pace again. \"Well,\nnever mind. I've been without a proper steward for some time now. You will\nserve me now.\"\n\"I apologize, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said, bowing slightly. \"But that will\nnot be possible.\"\nJastes frowned. \"You're a steward—I can tell that from the robes. Is\nElend so great a master that you would deny me?\"\n\"Elend Venture is not my master, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said, meeting\nthe young king's eyes. \"Now that we are free, the Terrismen no longer call\nany man master. I cannot be your servant, for I can be no man's servant.\nKeep me as prisoner, if you must. But I will not serve you. I apologize.\"\nJastes paused again. Instead of being angry, however, he simply\nseemed. . .embarrassed. \"I see.\"\n\"Your Majesty,\" Sazed said calmly, \"I realize that you commanded me\nto ask no questions, so I will instead make observations. You appear to have\nplaced yourself in a very poor position. I know not how you control these\nkoloss, but I cannot help but think that your grip is tenuous. You are in\ndanger, and you appear intent on sharing that danger with others.\"\nJastes flushed. \"Your 'observations' are flawed, Terrisman. I am in\ncontrol of this army. They obey me completely. How many other noblemen\nhave you seen gather koloss armies? None—only I have been successful.\"\n\"They do not seem very much under control, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Oh?\" Jastes asked. \"And did they tear you apart when they found\nyou? Pummel you to death for sport? Ram a stick through you and roast\nyou over one of their fires? No. They don't do these things because I\ncommanded them otherwise. It may not seem like much, Terrisman, but\ntrust me—this is a sign of great restraint and obedience for koloss.\"\n\"Civilization is no great achievement, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Do not try me, Terrisman!\" Jastes snapped, running a hand through\nthe remnants of his hair. \"These are koloss we speak of—we can't expect\nmuch from them.\""

He kept them away from cities. You\nbring them to the most populated area in all of the Final Empire!\"\n\"You don't understand,\" Jastes said. \"I tried overtures of peace, but\nnobody listens unless you have money or an army. Well, I have one, and I'll\nsoon have the other. I know Elend's sitting on that stash of atium—and I'm\njust come to. . .to make an alliance with him.\"\n\"An alliance where you take over control of the city?\"\n\"Bah!\" Jastes said with a wave of his hand. \"Elend doesn't control\nLuthadel—he's just a placeholder waiting for someone more powerful to\ncome along. He's a good man, but he's an innocent idealist. He's going to\nlose his throne to one army or another, and I'll give him a better deal than\nCett or Straff will, that's certain.\"\nCett? Straff? What kind of trouble has young Venture gotten himself\ninto? Sazed shook his head. \"Somehow I doubt that a 'better deal' involves\nthe use of koloss, Your Majesty.\"\nJastes frowned. \"You certainly are smart-mouthed, Terrisman. You're a\nsign—your entire people are a sign—of what has gone wrong with the\nworld. I used to respect the Terris people. There's no shame in being a good\nservant.\"\n\"There's often little pride in it either,\" Sazed said. \"But, I apologize for\nmy attitude, Your Majesty. It is not a manifestation of Terris independence. I\nhave always been too free with my comments, I think. I never made the best\nof stewards.\" Or the best of Keepers, he added to himself.\n\"Bah,\" Jastes said again, resuming his pacing.\n\"Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"I must continue to Luthadel. There are. .\n.events I need to deal with. Think what you will of my people, but you must\nknow that we are honest. The work I do is beyond politics and wars, thrones\nand armies. It is important for all men.\"\n\"Scholars always say things like that,\" Jastes said. He paused. \"Elend\nalways said things like that.\"\n\"Regardless,\" Sazed continued, \"I must be allowed to leave. In\nexchange for my freedom, I will deliver a message from you to His Majesty\nKing Elend, if you wish.\"\n\"I could send a messenger of my own at any time!\"\n\"And leave yourself with one less man to protect you from the\nkoloss?\" Sazed said.\nJastes paused just briefly.\nAh, so he does fear them. Good. At least he's not insane.\n\"I will be leaving, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"I do not mean to be\narrogant, but I can see that you don't have the resources to keep prisoners.\nYou can let me go, or you can give me to the koloss. I would be wary,\nhowever, of letting them get into a habit of killing humans.\""

I will speak with Elend. I will need the\nreturn of my possessions, however.\"\nThe king waved a hand in annoyance, and Sazed withdrew, waiting\nquietly as the lead guard entered the king's chambers again and received his\norders. As he waited for the soldiers to prepare—his pack thankfully\nreturned to him—Sazed thought about what Jastes had said. Cett or Straff.\nJust how many forces were working on Elend to take his city?\nIf Sazed had wanted a quiet place to study, he'd apparently chosen the\nwrong direction to run.\nIt wasn't until a few years later that I began to notice the signs. I knew\nthe prophecies—I am a Terris Worldbringer, after all. And yet, not all of us\nare religious men; some, such as myself, are more interested in other topics.\nHowever, during my time with Alendi, I could not help but become more\ninterested in the Anticipation. He seemed to fit the signs so well.\n20\n\"THIS IS GOING TO BE dangerous, Your Majesty,\" Dockson said.\n\"It's our only option,\" Elend said. He stood behind his table; it was, as\nusual, stacked with books. He was backlit by the study's window, and its\ncolors fell upon the back of his white uniform, dyeing it a brilliant maroon.\nHe certainly does look more commanding in that outfit, Vin thought,\nsitting in Elend's plush reading chair, OreSeur resting patiently on the floor\nbeside her. She still wasn't sure what to think of the changes in Elend. She\nknew the alterations were mostly visual—new clothing, new haircut—but\nother things about him seemed to be changing as well. He stood up\nstraighter when he spoke, and was more authoritative. He was even training\nin the sword and the cane.\nVin glanced at Tindwyl. The matronly Terriswoman sat in a stiff chair\nat the back of the room, watching the proceedings. She had perfect posture,\nand was ladylike in her colorful skirt and blouse. She didn't sit with her legs\nfolded beneath her, as Vin currently did, and she'd never wear trousers.\nWhat is it about her? Vin thought. I've spent a year trying to get Elend\nto practice his swordsmanship. Tindwyl's been here less than a month, and\nshe already has him sparring.\nWhy did Vin feel bitter? Elend wouldn't change that much, would he?"

I didn't spend a lot of time\npoliticking in the court when I was younger. However, one thing I did learn\nto do was manipulate my father. I know Straff Venture—and I know that I\ncan beat him. Besides, he doesn't want me dead.\"\n\"Can we be sure of that?\" Ham asked, rubbing his chin.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said. \"After all, Straff hasn't sent assassins after me, while\nCett has. It makes sense. What better person for Straff to leave in control of\nLuthadel than his own son? He thinks he can control me—he'll assume that\nhe can make me give him Luthadel. If I play into that, I should be able to\nget him to attack Cett.\"\n\"He does have a point. . .\" Ham said.\n\"Yes,\" Dockson said, \"but what is to keep Straff from just taking you\nhostage and forcing his way into Luthadel?\"\n\"He'll still have Cett at his back,\" Elend said. \"If he fights us, he'll lose\nmen—a lot of men—and expose himself to attack from behind.\"\n\"But he'll have you, my dear man,\" Breeze said. \"He wouldn't have to\nattack Luthadel—he could force us to give in.\"\n\"You'll have orders to let me die first\" Elend said. \"That's why I set up\nthe Assembly. It has the power to choose a new king.\"\n\"But why?\" Ham asked. \"Why take this risk, El? Let's wait a bit longer\nand see if we can get Straff to meet with you in a more neutral location.\"\nElend sighed. \"You have to listen to me, Ham. Siege or no siege, we\ncan't just sit here. If we do, either we'll get starved out, or one of those\narmies will decide to break the siege and attack us, hoping to take our walls,\nthen turn and immediately defend against its enemies. They won't do that\neasily, but it could happen. It will happen, if we don't begin to play the\nkings against one another.\"\nThe room fell silent. The others slowly turned toward Clubs, who\nnodded. He agreed.\nGood job, Elend, Vin thought."

He always did that when he was nervous.\n\"I'm afraid that this isn't a discussion,\" Elend said. \"I've made my\ndecision.\"\nThey're not going to accept a declaration like that, Vin thought. The\ncrew were an independent lot.\nYet, surprisingly, none of them objected.\nDockson finally nodded his head. \"All right, Your Majesty,\" he said.\n\"You're going to need to walk a dangerous line—make Straff believe that he\ncan count on our support, but also convince him that he can betray us at his\nleisure. You have to make him want our strength of arms while at the same\ntime dismissing our strength of will.\"\n\"And,\" Breeze added, \"you need to do so without him figuring out that\nyou're playing both sides.\"\n\"Can you do it?\" Ham asked. \"Honestly, Elend?\"\nElend nodded. \"I can do it, Ham. I've gotten much better at politics this\nlast year.\" He said the words with confidence, though Vin noticed that he\nstill had his fists clenched. He'll have to learn not to do that.\n\"You may, perhaps, understand politics,\" Breeze said, \"but this is\nscamming.

Didn't he\nalso deserve a woman who shared his interests, one who didn't find reading\na chore? A woman with whom he could talk about his brilliant political\ntheories?\nWhy am I thinking about our relationship so much lately? Vin thought.\nWe don't belong in their world, Zane had said.

Once that is done, I can return with—hopefully—good news for\nthe Assembly. At that point, I can argue that the resolution hasn't been\nfulfilled. For now, the meeting goes forward.\"\nMore decisive indeed, Vin thought. He's changing. . ..\nShe had to stop thinking about things like that. Instead, she focused on\nsomething else. The conversation turned to specific ways that Elend could\nmanipulate Straff, each of the crewmembers giving him tips on how to\nscam effectively. Vin, however, found herself watching them, looking for\ndiscrepancies in their personalities, trying to decide if any of them might be\nthe kandra spy.\nWas Clubs being even quieter than normal? Was Spook's shift in\nlanguage patterns due to growing maturity, or because the kandra had\ndifficulty mimicking his slang? Was Ham, perhaps, too jovial? He also\nseemed to focus less on his little philosophical puzzles than he once had.\nWas that because he was more serious now, or because the kandra didn't\nknow how to imitate him properly?\nIt was no good. If she thought too much, she could spot seeming\ndiscrepancies in anyone. Yet, at the same time, they all seemed like\nthemselves. People were just too complex to reduce to simple personality\ntraits. Plus, the kandra would be good—very good. He would have a\nlifetime of training in the art of imitating others, and he had probably been\nplanning his insertion for a long time.\nIt came down to Allomancy, then. With all of the activities surrounding\nthe siege and her studies about the Deepness, however, she hadn't had a\nchance to test her friends. As she thought about it, she admitted that the lack\nof time excuse was a weak one. The truth was that she was probably\ndistracting herself because the thought of one of the crew—one of her first\ngroup of friends—being a traitor was just too upsetting.\nShe had to get over that. If there really were a spy in the group, that\nwould be the end of them. If the enemy kings found out about the tricks\nElend was planning. . .\nThis in mind, she tentatively burned bronze. Immediately, she sensed\nan Allomantic pulse from Breeze—dear, incorrigible Breeze. He was so\ngood at Allomancy that even Vin couldn't detect his touch most of the time,\nbut he was also compulsive about using his power.\nHe wasn't currently using it on her, however. She closed her eyes,\nfocusing. Once, long ago, Marsh had tried to train her in the fine art of\nusing bronze to read Allomantic pulses. She hadn't realized at the time just\nhow large a task he'd begun.\nWhen an Allomancer burned a metal, they gave off an invisible,\ndrumlike beat that only another Allomancer burning bronze could sense.\nThe rhythm of these pulses—how quickly the beats came, the way they\n\"sounded\"—told exactly what metal was being burned."

She focused. Breeze was burning brass—the internal, mental\nPushing metal. And. . .\nVin focused harder. She could feel a pattern washing over her, a double\ndum-dum beat with each pulse. They felt oriented to her right. The pulses\nwere washing against something else, something that was sucking them in.\nElend. Breeze was focused on Elend. Not surprising, considering the\ncurrent discussion. Breeze was always Pushing on the people he interacted\nwith.\nSatisfied, Vin sat back. But then she paused.

I wonder. . ..\nShe squeezed her eyes shut—ignoring the fact that any of the others\nwho saw her would think her actions strange—and focused again on the\nAllomantic pulses. She flared the bronze, concentrating so hard she felt\nshe'd give herself a headache. There was a. . .vibration to the pulses. But\nwhat that could mean, she wasn't certain.\nFocus! she told herself. However, the pulses stubbornly refused to\nyield any further information.\nFine, she thought. I'll cheat.

But she got something from them.\nAnxiety, nervousness, worry, insecurity, anxiety, nervousness, worry—\nIt was gone, her bronze expended in one massive flare of power. Vin\nopened her eyes; no one in the room was looking at her except OreSeur.\nShe felt drained. The headache she'd predicted before now came in full\nforce, thudding inside her head like the tiny brother of the drum she'd now\nbanished. However, she held to the information she'd gleaned. It hadn't\ncome in words, but feelings—and her first fear was that Breeze was making\nthese emotions appear. Anxiety, nervousness, worry. However, she\nimmediately realized that Breeze was a Soother. If he focused on emotions,\nit would be the ones he was dampening. The ones he was using his powers\nto Soothe away.\nShe looked from him to Elend. Why. . .he's making Elend more\nconfident! If Elend stood a little taller, it was because Breeze was quietly\nhelping, Soothing away anxiety and worry. And Breeze did this even as he\nargued and made his usual mocking comments.\nVin studied the plump man, ignoring her headache, feeling a newfound\nsense of admiration. She'd always wondered just a little at Breeze's\nplacement in the crew. The other men were all, to an extent, idealists. Even\nClubs, beneath his crotchety exterior, had always struck her as a solidly\ngood man.\nBreeze was different.

You just try\nyour best to hide it.\nAnd he also wasn't the impostor. She'd known that before, of course;\nBreeze hadn't been in the city when the kandra had made the switch.\nHowever, having a second confirmation lifted a tiny bit of her burden.\nNow if she could just eliminate some of the others.\nElend bid the crew farewell after the meeting. Dockson went to pen the\nrequested letters, Ham to go over security, Clubs back to training the\nsoldiers, and Breeze to try and placate the Assembly regarding Elend's lack\nof attention.\nVin trailed out of the study, shooting him a glance, then eyeing\nTindwyl. Suspicious of her still, eh? Elend thought with amusement. He\nnodded reassuringly, and Vin frowned, looking just a little annoyed. He\nwould have let her stay, but. . .well, facing Tindwyl was embarrassing\nenough alone.\nVin left the room, wolfhound kandra at her side. Looks like she's\ngrowing more attached to the creature, Elend thought with satisfaction. It\nwas good to know that someone watched over her.\nVin shut the door behind her, and Elend sighed, rubbing his shoulder.\nSeveral weeks of training with the sword and cane were taking a lot out of\nhim, and his body was bruised. He tried to keep the pain from showing—or,\nrather, from letting Tindwyl see him show the pain. At least I proved that\nI'm learning, he thought. She had to see how well I did today.\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\"You are an embarrassment,\" Tindwyl said, standing before her chair.\n\"So you like to say,\" Elend said, walking forward to begin piling up a\nstack of books. Tindwyl said that he needed to let servants keep his study\nclean, something he'd always resisted. The clutter of books and papers felt\nright to him, and he certainly didn't want someone else moving them\naround.\nWith her standing there looking at him, however, it was difficult not to\nfeel self-conscious about the mess. He stacked another book on the pile.\n\"Surely you noticed how well I did,\" Elend said. \"I got them to let me\ngo into Straff's camp.\"\n\"You are king, Elend Venture,\" Tindwyl said, arms folded. \"Nobody\n'lets' you do anything. The first change in attitude has to be your own—you\nhave to stop thinking that you need permission or agreement from those\nwho follow you.\"\n\"A king should lead by consent of his citizens,\" Elend said. \"I will not\nbe another Lord Ruler.\"\n\"A king should be strong,\" Tindwyl said firmly. \"He accepts counsel,"

They use my name.\"\n\"Or a close approximation of it. Right, 'El'?\"\nElend flushed, setting one final book on the stack. \"You'd have me\nforce my friends to address me by my title?\"\n\"Yes,\" Tindwyl said. \"Especially in public. You should be addressed as\n'Your Majesty,' or at least as 'my lord.'\"\n\"I doubt Ham would deal well with that,\" Elend said. \"He has some\nissues with authority.\"\n\"He will get over them,\" Tindwyl said, wiping her finger along a\nbookcase. She didn't need to hold it up for Elend to know there would be\ndust on its tip.\n\"What about you?\" Elend challenged.\n\"Me?\"\n\"You call me 'Elend Venture,' not 'Your Majesty.'\"\n\"I am different,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"Well, I don't see why you should be. You can call me 'Your Majesty'\nfrom now on.\"\nTindwyl smiled slyly. \"Very well, Your Majesty. You can unclench\nyour fists now. You're going to have to work on that—a statesman should\nnot give visual clues of his nervousness.\"\nElend glanced down, relaxing his hands. \"All right.\"\n\"In addition,\" Tindwyl continued, \"you still hedge too much in your\nlanguage. It makes you seem timid and hesitant.\"\n\"I'm working on that.\"\n\"Don't apologize unless you really mean it,\" Tindwyl said. \"And don't\nmake excuses. You don't need them. A leader is often judged by how well\nhe bears responsibility. As king, everything that happens in your kingdom—\nregardless of who commits the act—is your fault. You are even responsible\nfor unavoidable events such as earthquakes or storms.\"\n\"Or armies,\" Elend said.\nTindwyl nodded. \"Or armies. It is your responsibility to deal with these\nthings, and if something goes wrong, it is your fault. You simply have to\naccept this.\"\nElend nodded, picking up a book.\n\"Now, let's talk about guilt,\" Tindwyl said, seating herself. \"Stop\ncleaning. That isn't a job for a king.\"\nElend sighed, setting down the book.\n\"Guilt,\" Tindwyl said, \"does not become a king. You have to stop\nfeeling sorry for yourself.\"\n\"You just told me everything that happens in the kingdom is my fault!\"\n\"It is.\"\n\"How can I not feel guilty, then?\"\n\"You have to feel confident that your actions are the best,\" Tindwyl\nexplained. \"You have to know that no matter how bad things get, they\nwould be worse without you.

If\nthere is anything worse than a mediocre king, it is chaos—which is what\nthis kingdom would have if you hadn't taken the throne. The people on both\nsides, noblemen and skaa, accept you.

But—\"\nHe was interrupted by a knock at the door. Captain Demoux entered a\nmoment later. \"Your Majesty, a visitor has arrived from Lord Cett's army.\"\n\"A messenger?\" Elend said, standing.\nDemoux paused, looking a little embarrassed. \"Well. . .sort of. She\nsays she's Lord Cett's daughter, and she's come looking for Breeze.\"\nHe was born of a humble family, yet married the daughter of a king.\n21\nTHE YOUNG WOMAN'S EXPENSIVE DRESS—light red silk with\na shawl and lace sleeves—might have lent her an air of dignity, had she not\nscampered forward as soon as Breeze entered the room. Her light Western\nhair bouncing, she made a squeal of happiness as she threw her arms around\nBreeze's neck.\nShe was, perhaps, eighteen years old.\nElend glanced at Ham, who stood dumbfounded.\n\"Well, looks like you were right about Breeze and Cett's daughter,\"\nElend whispered.\nHam shook his head. \"I didn't think. . .I mean I joked, because it was\nBreeze, but I didn't expect to be right!\"\nBreeze, for his part, at least had the decency to look terribly\nuncomfortable in the young woman's arms. They stood inside the palace\natrium, the same place where Elend had met with his father's messenger.\nFloor-to-ceiling windows let in the afternoon light, and a group of servants\nstood at one side of the room to wait on Elend's orders.\nBreeze met Elend's eyes, blushing deeply. I don't think I've ever seen\nhim do that before, Elend thought.\n\"My dear,\" Breeze said, clearing his throat, \"perhaps you should\nintroduce yourself to the king?\"\nThe girl finally let go of Breeze. She stepped back, curtsying to Elend\nwith a noblewoman's grace. She was a bit plump, her hair long after pre-\nCollapse fashion, and her cheeks were red with excitement. She was a cute\nthing, obviously well trained for the court—exactly the sort of girl that\nElend had spent his youth trying to avoid.\n\"Elend,\" Breeze said, \"might I introduce Allrianne Cett, daughter to\nLord Ashweather Cett, king of the Western Dominance?\"\n\"Your Majesty,\" Allrianne said.\nElend nodded. \"Lady Cett.\" He paused, then—with a hopeful voice—\ncontinued. \"Your father sent you as an ambassador?\"\nAllrianne paused. \"Um. . .he didn't exactly send me, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Oh, dear,\" Breeze said, pulling out a handkerchief to dab his brow.\nElend glanced at Ham, then back at the girl. \"Perhaps you should"

I mean, Breezy must have told you how my father is!\"\nBreeze sat uncomfortably, and Allrianne put an affectionate hand on\nhis knee.\n\"How your father is?\" Elend asked.\n\"He is so manipulative,\" Allrianne said. \"So demanding. He drove\nBreezy away, and I absolutely had to follow. I wouldn't spend another\nmoment in that camp. A war camp! He brought me, a young lady, along\nwith him to war! Why, do you know what it is like to be leered at by every\npassing soldier? Do you understand what it is like to live in a tent?\"\n\"I—\"\n\"We rarely had fresh water,\" Allrianne continued. \"And I couldn't take\na decent bath without fear of peeping soldiers! During our travels, there was\ndreadful nothing to do all day but sit in the carriage and bounce, bounce,\nbounce. Why, until Breezy came, I hadn't had a refined conversation in\nweeks. And then, Father drove him away. . ..\"\n\"Because?\" Ham asked eagerly.\nBreeze coughed.\n\"I had to get away, Your Majesty,\" Allrianne said. \"You have to give\nme asylum! I know things that could help you. Like, I saw my father's\ncamp. I'll bet you don't know that he is getting supplies from the cannery in\nHaverfrex! What do you think of that?\"\n\"Um. . .impressive,\" Elend said hesitantly.\nAllrianne nodded curtly.\n\"And, you came to find Breeze?\" Elend asked.\nAllrianne flushed slightly, glancing to the side. However, when she\nspoke, she displayed little tact. \"I had to see him again, Your Majesty. So\ncharming, so. . .wonderful. I wouldn't have expected Father to understand a\nman such as he.\"\n\"I see,\" Elend said.\n\"Please, Your Majesty,\" Allrianne said. \"You have to take me in.

Perhaps you would like an opportunity to refresh\nyourself. . .?\"\n\"Oh, I would much appreciate that, Your Majesty!\"\nElend eyed Cadon, one of the palace stewards, who stood at the back\nof the room with other servants. He nodded; rooms were prepared. \"Then,\"\nElend said, standing, \"Cadon will lead you to some rooms.

Breeze sighed deeply, leaning back in a wearied posture as\nDockson walked forward, taking the girl's seat.\n\"That was. . .unexpected,\" Breeze noted.\nThere was an awkward pause, the atrium trees shifting slightly in the\nbreeze from the balcony. Then—with a sharp bark—Ham began to laugh.\nThe noise sparked Elend, and—despite the danger, despite the gravity of the\nproblem—he found himself laughing as well.\n\"Oh, honestly,\" Breeze huffed, which only prompted them further.\nPerhaps it was the sheer incongruity of the situation, perhaps it was because\nhe needed to release tension, but Elend found himself laughing so hard he\nalmost fell from the chair. Ham wasn't doing much better, and even\nDockson cracked a smile.\n\"I fail to see the levity in this situation,\" Breeze said. \"The daughter of\nLord Cett—a man who is currently besieging our home—just demanded\nasylum in the city.

Honestly, I thought we would be able to avoid unplanned\nfemale attachments now that Kell is gone.\"\n\"This isn't my fault,\" Breeze said pointedly. \"The girl's affection is\ncompletely misplaced.\"\n\"That's for sure,\" Ham mumbled.\n\"All right,\" a new voice said. \"What was that pink thing I just passed\nin the hallway?\"\nElend turned to find Vin standing, arms folded, in the atrium doorway.\nSo quiet. Why does she walk stealthily even in the palace? She never wore\nshoes that clicked, never wore skirts that could rustle, and never had metal\non her clothing that could clink or be Pushed by Allomancers.\n\"That wasn't pink, my dear,\" Breeze said. \"That was red.\"\n\"Close enough,\" Vin said, walking forward. \"She was bubbling to the\nservants about how hot her bath needed to be, and making certain they\nwrote down her favorite foods.\"\nBreeze sighed. \"That's Allrianne. We'll probably have to get a new\npastry chef—either that, or have desserts ordered in. She's rather particular\nabout her pastries.\"\n\"Allrianne Cett is the daughter of Lord Cett,\" Elend explained as Vin\n—ignoring the chairs—sat on the edge of a planter beside his chair, laying a\nhand on his arm. \"Apparently, she and Breeze are something of an item.\"\n\"Excuse me?\" Breeze huffed."

Nearly as good, even, as my own. Yet, he was not\nargumentative.\n22\nCHAOS AND STABILITY, THE MIST was both. Upon the land there\nwas an empire, within that empire were a dozen shattered kingdoms, within\nthose kingdoms were cities, towns, villages, plantations. And above them\nall, within them all, around them all, was the mist. It was more constant\nthan the sun, for it could not be hidden by clouds. It was more powerful\nthan the storms, for it would outlast any weather's fury. It was always there.\nChanging, but eternal.\nDay was an impatient sigh, awaiting the night. When the darkness did\ncome, however, Vin found that the mists did not calm her as they once had.\nNothing seemed certain anymore. Once the night had been her refuge;\nnow she found herself glancing behind, watching for ghostly outlines. Once\nElend had been her peace, but he was changing. Once she had been able to\nprotect the things she loved—but she was growing more and more afraid\nthat the forces moving against Luthadel were beyond her capacity to stop.\nNothing frightened her more than her own impotence. During her\nchildhood she had taken it for granted that she couldn't change things, but\nKelsier had given her pride in herself.\nIf she couldn't protect Elend, what good was she?\nThere are still some things I can do, she thought forcefully. She\ncrouched quietly on a ledge, mistcloak tassels hanging down, waving\nslightly in the wind. Just below her, torches burned fitfully at the front of\nKeep Venture, illuminating a pair of Ham's guards. They stood alert in the\nswirling mists, showing impressive diligence.\nThe guards wouldn't be able to see her sitting just above them; they'd\nbarely be able to see twenty feet in the thick mists. They weren't\nAllomancers. Besides the core crew, Elend had access to barely half a dozen\nMistings—which made him Allomantically weak compared with most of\nthe other new kings in the Final Empire. Vin was supposed to make up the\ndifference.\nThe torches flickered as the doors opened, and a figure left the palace.\nHam's voice echoed quietly in the mist as he greeted his guards. One reason\n—perhaps the main reason—that the guards were so diligent was because of\nHam. He might have been a bit of an anarchist at heart, but he could be a\nvery good leader if he was given a small team. Though his guards weren't\nthe most disciplined, polished soldiers Vin had seen, they were fiercely\nloyal.\nHam talked with the men for a time, then he waved farewell and\nwalked out into the mists. The small courtyard between the keep and its\nwall contained a couple of guard posts and patrols, and Ham would visit\neach one in turn. He walked boldly in the night, trusting to diffused starlight"

She could cross\nanother name off her list.\n\"It's okay, Ham,\" Vin said, walking forward.\nHam paused, lowering his dueling cane. \"Vin?\" he asked, squinting in\nthe mist.\n\"It's me,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, you startled my hound. He can get\njumpy at night.\"\nHam relaxed. \"We all can, I guess. Anything happening tonight?\"\n\"Not that I can tell,\" she said. \"I'd let you know.\"\nHam nodded. \"I'd appreciate it—though I doubt you'd need me. I'm\ncaptain of the guard, but you're the one who does all the work.\"\n\"You're more valuable than you think, Ham,\" Vin said. \"Elend confides\nin you. Since Jastes and the others left him, he's needed a friend.\"\nHam nodded. Vin turned, glancing into the mists, where OreSeur sat\nwaiting on his haunches. He seemed to be getting more and more\ncomfortable with his hound's body.\nNow that she knew Ham was not an impostor, there was something she\nneeded to discuss with him. \"Ham,\" she said, \"your protection of Elend is\nmore valuable than you know.\"\n\"You're talking about the impostor,\" Ham said quietly. \"El has me\nsearching through the palace staff to see who might have gone missing for a\nfew hours on that day. It's a tough task, though.\"\nShe nodded. \"There's something else, Ham. I'm out of atium.\"\nHe stood quietly in the mists for a moment, and then she heard him\nmutter a curse.\n\"I'll die the next time I fight a Mistborn,\" she said.\n\"Not unless he has atium,\" Ham said.\n\"What are the chances that someone would send a Mistborn without\natium to fight me?\"\nHe hesitated.\n\"Ham,\" she said, \"I need to find a way to fight against someone who is\nburning atium.

I once\nhad a long conversation with Breeze about this—though he spent most of it\ngrumbling that I was annoying him.\"\n\"Well?\" Vin asked. \"What can I do?\"\nHe rubbed his chin. \"Most people agree that the best way to kill a\nMistborn with atium is to surprise them.\"\n\"That doesn't help if they attack me first,\" Vin said.\n\"Well,\" Ham said. \"Barring surprise, there isn't much. Some people\nthink that you might be able to kill an atium-using Mistborn if you catch\nthem in an unavoidable situation. It's like a game of fets—sometimes, the\nonly way to take a piece is to corner it so that no matter which way it\nmoves, it dies.\n\"Doing that to a Mistborn is pretty tough, though. The thing is, atium\nlets the Mistborn see the future—so he knows when a move will trap him,\nand so he can avoid the situation. The metal is supposed to enhance his\nmind somehow, too.\"\n\"It does. When I'm burning atium, I often dodge before I even register\nthe attacks that are coming.\"\nHam nodded.\n\"So,\" Vin said, \"what else?\"\n\"That's it, Vin,\" Ham said. \"Thugs talk about this topic a lot—we're all\nafraid of going up against a Mistborn. Those are your two options: Surprise\nhim or overwhelm him. I'm sorry.\"\nVin frowned. Neither option would do her much good if she got\nambushed. \"Anyway, I need to keep moving. I promise to tell you about any\ncorpses I produce.\"\nHam laughed. \"How about you just try and avoid getting into\nsituations where you have to produce them, eh? The Lord only knows what\nthis kingdom would do if we lost you. . .\"\nVin nodded, though she wasn't certain how much Ham could see of her\nin the darkness. She waved to OreSeur, heading out toward the keep wall,\nleaving Ham on the cobbled path.\n\"Mistress,\" OreSeur said as they reached the top of the wall, \"might I\nknow the purpose of surprising Master Hammond like that? Are you that\nfond of startling your friends?\"\n\"It was a test,\" Vin said, pausing beside a merlon gap, looking out over\nthe city proper.\n\"A test, Mistress?\"\n\"To see if he would use Allomancy. That way, I could know that he\nwasn't the impostor.\"\n\"Ah,\" the kandra said. \"Clever, Mistress.\"\nVin smiled. \"Thank you,\" she said. A guard patrol was moving toward\nthem. Not wanting to have to deal with them, Vin nodded to the wall-top\nstone guardhouse. She jumped, pushing off a coin, and landed on top of it.\nOreSeur bounded up beside her, using his strange kandra musculature to\nleap the ten feet.\nVin sat down cross-legged to think, and OreSeur padded over to the\nroof's side and lay down, paws hanging over the edge.

She\nleaned back in frustration, staring up into the endless mists, using her\nmistcloak to cushion her head.\n\"Your plan will work, Mistress,\" OreSeur said quietly.\nVin paused, rolling her head to look at him. He lay with head on\nforepaws, staring over the city. \"If you sense Allomancy from someone,\nthen they aren't a kandra.\"\nVin sensed a hesitant reluctance to his words, and he didn't look at her.\nIt was as if he spoke grudgingly, giving up information that he'd rather have\nkept to himself.\nSo secretive, Vin thought. \"Thank you,\" she said.\nOreSeur shrugged a pair of canine shoulders.\n\"I know you'd rather not have to deal with me,\" she said. \"We'd both\nrather keep our distance from each other.

There was a wisdom in those eyes,\nan understanding that Vin was surprised to see. She'd never seen such things\nin him before.\n\"I. . .\" Vin trailed off, looking away. \"I just haven't ever gotten over the\nfact that you ate Kelsier's body.\"\n\"That isn't it,\" OreSeur said, turning back to look at the city. \"You're\ntoo smart to be bothered by that.\"\nVin frowned indignantly, but the kandra wasn't looking at her. She\nturned, staring back up at the mists. Why did he bring this up? she thought.\nWe were just starting to get along. She'd been willing to forget.\nYou really want to know? she thought. Fine.\n\"It's because you knew,\" she whispered.\n\"Excuse me, Mistress?\"\n\"You knew,\" Vin said, still looking into the mists. \"You were the only\none on the crew who knew Kelsier was going to die. He told you that he\nwas going to let himself be killed, and that you were to take his bones.\"\n\"Ah,\" OreSeur said quietly.\nVin turned accusing eyes at the creature. \"Why didn't you say\nsomething? You knew how we felt about Kelsier. Did you even consider\ntelling us that the idiot planned to kill himself?

You never even spoke of\nwhat you'd done.\"\n\"The Contract, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"You do not wish to hear this,\nperhaps, but I was bound. Kelsier did not wish you to know of his plans, so\nI could not tell you. Hate me if you must, but I do not regret my actions.\"\n\"I don't hate you.\" I got over that. \"But, honestly, you wouldn't even\nbreak the Contract for his own good? You served Kelsier for two years.\nDidn't it even hurt you to know he was going to die?\"\n\"Why should I care if one master or another dies?\" OreSeur said.\n\"There is always another to take their place.\"\n\"Kelsier wasn't that kind of master,\" Vin said.\n\"Wasn't he?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I apologize, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"I will believe as commanded,\nthen.\"\nVin opened her mouth to reply, then snapped it closed. If he was\ndetermined to keep thinking like a fool, then it was his right to do so. He\ncould continue to resent masters, just as. . .\nJust as she resented him. For keeping his word, for holding to his\nContract.\nEver since I've known him, I've done nothing but treat him poorly, Vin\nthought. First, when he was Renoux, I reacted against his haughty bearing\n—but that bearing wasn't his, it was part of the act he had to play. Then, as\nOreSeur, I avoided him. Hated him, even, for letting Kelsier die. Now I've\nforced him into an animal's body.\nAnd, in two years of knowing him, the only times I've asked about his\npast, I did it so that I could glean more information about his people so that\nI could find the impostor.\nVin watched the mists. Of all the people in the crew, only OreSeur had\nbeen an outsider. He hadn't been invited to their conferences. He hadn't\ninherited a position in the government. He'd helped as much as any of them,\nplaying a vital role—that of the \"spirit\" Kelsier, who had returned from the\ngrave to incite the skaa to their final rebellion. Yet, while the rest of them\nhad titles, friendships, and duties, the only thing OreSeur had gained from\noverthrowing the Final Empire was another master.\nOne who hated him.\nNo wonder he reacts like he does, Vin thought. Kelsier's last words to\nher returned to her mind: You have a lot to learn about friendship, Vin. . ..\nKell and the others had invited her in, treated her with dignity and\nfriendliness, even when she hadn't deserved it.\n\"OreSeur,\" she said, \"what was your life like before you were recruited\nby Kelsier?\"\n\"I don't see what that has to do with finding the impostor, Mistress,\"\nOreSeur said."

So much for that.\nBut. . .well, Kelsier and the others hadn't turned away when she'd been\nblunt with them. There was a familiar tone to OreSeur's words. Something\nin them that she recognized.\n\"Anonymity,\" Vin said quietly.\n\"Mistress?\"\n\"Anonymity. Hiding, even when you're with others. Being quiet,\nunobtrusive. Forcing yourself to stay apart—emotionally, at least. It's a way\nof life. A protection.\"\nOreSeur didn't answer.\n\"You serve beneath masters,\" Vin said. \"Harsh men who fear your\ncompetence. The only way to keep them from hating you is to make certain\nthey don't pay attention to you. So, you make yourself look small and weak.\nNot a threat. But sometimes you say the wrong thing, or you let your\nrebelliousness show.\"\nShe turned toward him. He was watching her. \"Yes,\" he finally said,\nturning to look back over the city.\n\"They hate you,\" Vin said quietly. \"They hate you because of your\npowers, because they can't make you break your word, or because they\nworry that you are too strong to control.\"\n\"They become afraid of you,\" OreSeur said. \"They grow paranoid—\nterrified, even as they use you, that you will take their place. Despite the\nContract, despite knowing that no kandra would break his sacred vow, they\nfear you. And men hate what they fear.\"\n\"And so,\" Vin said, \"they find excuses to beat you. Sometimes, even\nyour efforts to remain harmless seem to provoke them. They hate your skill,\nthey hate the fact that they don't have more reasons to beat you, so they beat\nyou.\"\nOreSeur turned back to her. \"How do you know these things?\" he\ndemanded.\nVin shrugged. \"That's not only how they treat kandra, OreSeur. That's\nthe same way crewleaders treat a young girl—an anomaly in a thieving\nunderground filled with men.

A tool, yet a threat at the same time.\"\n\"I. . .didn't realize, Mistress. . ..\"\nVin frowned. How could he not have known about my past? He knew I\nwas a street urchin. Except. . .had he? For the first time, Vin realized how\nOreSeur must have seen her two years before, when she'd first met him. He\nhad arrived in the area after her recruitment; he probably assumed that she'd\nbeen part of Kelsier's team for years, like the others.\n\"Kelsier recruited me for the first time just a few days before I met\nyou,\" Vin said. \"Well, actually, he didn't so much recruit me as rescue me.

And that made them hate\nme.\"\n\"So they beat you?\"\nVin nodded. \"The last one especially. That was when I was really\nbeginning to figure out how to use Allomancy, even though I didn't know\nwhat it was. Camon knew, though. And he hated me even as he used me.

And\non that day, he worried that I would kill him. . .\" Vin turned her head,\nlooking at OreSeur. \"Kill him and take his place as crewleader.\"\nOreSeur sat quietly, up on his haunches now, regarding her.\n\"Kandra aren't the only ones that humans treat poorly,\" Vin said\nquietly. \"We're pretty good at abusing each other, too.\"\nOreSeur snorted. \"With you, at least, they had to hold back for fear\nthey'd kill you. Have you ever been beaten by a master who knows that no\nmatter how hard he hits, you won't die? All he has to do is get you a new set\nof bones, and you'll be ready to serve again the next day. We are the\nultimate servant—you can beat us to death in the morning, then have us\nserve you dinner that night. All the sadism, none of the cost.\"\nVin closed her eyes. \"I understand.

You think a monster like that, a legend\nused to frighten children, will ever find acceptance in your society?\"\nVin frowned.\n\"This is the reason for the Contract, Mistress,\" OreSeur said, his\nmuffled voice harsh as he spoke through dog's lips. \"You wonder why we\ndon't just run away from you? Meld into your society, and become unseen?\nWe tried that. Long ago, when the Final Empire was new. Your people\nfound us, and they started to destroy us. They used Mistborn to hunt us\ndown, for there were many more Allomancers in those days. Your people\nhated us because they feared we would replace them.

Our people offered to\nserve, and we devised a binding contract—one that every kandra vowed to\nuphold. We will not kill men. We will take bones only when we are\ncommanded.

They still hated and feared\nus—but they also knew they could command us.\n\"We became your tools. As long as we remain subservient, Mistress,\nwe survive. And that is why I obey.

Footsteps outside the wall\na short distance away. She leaned closer, noticing a dark figure walking\ndown the street toward the keep. She'd been so focused on her bronze that\nshe'd completely tuned out real sounds.\n\"Good job,\" she said, approaching the edge of the guard station's roof.\nOnly then did she realize something important. OreSeur had taken the\ninitiative: he'd alerted her of the danger without specifically being ordered\nto listen.\nIt was a small thing, but it seemed important.\n\"What do you think?\" she asked quietly, watching the figure approach.\nHe carried no torch, and he seemed very comfortable in the mists.\n\"Allomancer?\" OreSeur asked, crouching beside her.\nVin shook her head. \"There's no Allomantic pulse.\"\n\"So if he is one, he's Mistborn,\" OreSeur said.

Come, we must speak with\nHis Majesty. I have news of a rather disconcerting nature.\"\nVin let go, looking up at his kindly face, noting the tiredness in his\neyes. Exhaustion. His robes were dirty and smelled of ash and sweat. Sazed\nwas usually very meticulous, even when he traveled. \"What is it?\" she\nasked.\n\"Problems, Lady Vin,\" he said quietly. \"Problems and troubles.\"\nThe Terris rejected him, but he came to lead them.\n23\n\"KING LEKAL CLAIMED THAT HE had twenty thousand of the\ncreatures in his army,\" Sazed said quietly.\nTwenty thousand! Elend thought in shock. That was easily as\ndangerous as Straff's fifty thousand men. Probably more so.\nThe table fell silent, and Elend glanced at the others. They sat in the\npalace kitchen, where a couple of cooks hurriedly prepared a late-night\ndinner for Sazed. The white room had an alcove at the side with a modest\ntable for servant meals. Not surprisingly, Elend had never dined in the\nroom, but Sazed had insisted that they not wake the servants it would\nrequire to prepare the main dining hall, though he apparently hadn't eaten\nall day.\nSo, they sat on the low wooden benches, waiting while the cooks\nworked—far enough away that they couldn't hear the hushed conversation\nin the alcove. Vin sat beside Elend, arm around his waist, her wolfhound\nkandra on the floor beside her. Breeze sat on the other side of him, looking\ndisheveled; he'd been rather annoyed when they'd woken him.

Another proposal had needed work\n—a letter he would send to the Assembly explaining that he was meeting\nwith Straff informally, rather than in official parlay.\nDockson pulled over a stool, choosing a place away from Elend, as\nusual. Clubs sat slumped on his side of the bench, though Elend couldn't tell\nif the posture was from weariness or from general Clubs grumpiness. That\nleft only Spook, who sat on one of the serving tables a distance away, legs\nswinging over the side as he occasionally pilfered a tidbit of food from the\nannoyed cooks. He was, Elend noticed with amusement, flirting quite\nunsuccessfully with a drowsy kitchen girl.\nAnd then there was Sazed. The Terrisman sat directly across from\nElend with the calm sense of collectedness that only Sazed could manage.\nHis robes were dusty, and he looked odd without his earrings—removed to\nnot tempt thieves, Elend would guess—but his face and hands were clean.\nEven dirtied from travel, Sazed still gave off a sense of tidiness.\n\"I do apologize, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"But I do not think that\nLord Lekal is trustworthy. I realize that you were friends with him before\nthe Collapse, but his current state seems somewhat. . .unstable.\"\nElend nodded. \"How is he controlling them, you think?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"I cannot guess, Your Majesty.\"\nHam shook his head. \"I have men in the guard who came up from the\nSouth after the Collapse. They were soldiers, serving in a garrison near a\nkoloss camp. The Lord Ruler hadn't been dead a day before the creatures\nwent crazy. They attacked everything in the area—villages, garrisons,\ncities.\"\n\"The same happened in the Northwest,\" Breeze said. \"Lord Cett's lands\nwere being flooded with refugees running from rogue koloss. Cett tried to\nrecruit the koloss garrison near his own lands, and they followed him for a\ntime. But then, something set them off, and they just attacked his army. He\nhad to slaughter the whole lot—and lost nearly two thousand soldiers\nkilling a small garrison of five hundred koloss.\"\nThe group grew quiet again, the clacking and talking of the cooking\nstaff sounding a short distance away. Five hundred koloss killed two\nthousand men, Elend thought. And the Jastes force contains twenty\nthousand of the beasts. Lord Ruler. . .\n\"How long?\" said Clubs. \"How far away?\"\n\"It took me a little over a week to get here,\" Sazed said. \"Though it\nlooked as if King Lekal had been camped there for a time. He is obviously\ncoming this direction, but I don't know how quickly he intends to march.\"\n\"Probably wasn't expecting to find that two other armies beat him to\nthe city,\" Ham noted.\nElend nodded. \"What do we do, then?\"\n\"I don't see that we can do anything, Your Majesty,\" Dockson said,\nshaking his head. \"Sazed's report doesn't give me much hope that we'll be\nable to reason with Jastes. And, with the siege we're already under, there is\nlittle we can do.\""

By showing up with a pile of volatile koloss, he\ncould easily worry Cett and Straff enough that they would join forces\nagainst him.\"\n\"Which would suit us just fine,\" Clubs said. \"The more that other\npeople fight, the better off we are.\"\nElend sat back. He felt a looming anxiety, and it was good to have Vin\nnext to him, arm around him, even if she didn't say much. Sometimes, he\nfelt stronger simply because of her presence. Twenty thousand koloss. This\nsingle threat scared him more than either of the other armies.\n\"This could be a good thing,\" Ham said. \"If Jastes were to lose control\nof those beasts near Luthadel, there's a good chance they'd attack one of\nthose other armies.\"\n\"Agreed,\" Breeze said tiredly. \"I think we need to keep stalling, draw\nout this siege until the koloss army arrives. One more army in the mix\nmeans only more advantage for us.\"\n\"I don't like the idea of koloss in the area,\" Elend said, shivering\nslightly. \"No matter what advantage they offer us. If they attack the city. . .\"\n\"I say we worry about that when, and if, they arrive,\" Dockson said.\n\"For now, we have to continue our plan as we intended. His Majesty meets\nwith Straff, trying to manipulate him into a covert alliance with us. With\nluck, the imminent koloss presence will make him more willing to deal.\"\nElend nodded. Straff had agreed to meet, and they'd set a date for a\nfew days away. The Assembly was angry that he hadn't consulted with them\nabout the time and place, but there was little they could do about the matter.\n\"Anyway,\" Elend finally said, sighing. \"You said you had other news,\nSaze? Better, hopefully?\"\nSazed paused. A cook finally walked over, setting a plate of food\nbefore him: steamed barley with strips of steak and some spiced lagets. The\nscents were enough to make Elend a little hungry. He nodded thankfully to\nthe palace chef, who had insisted on preparing the meal himself despite the\nlate hour, and who waved to his staff and began to withdraw.\nSazed sat quietly, waiting to speak until the staff were again out of\nearshot. \"I hesitate to mention this, Your Majesty, for your burdens already\nseem great.\"\n\"You might as well just tell me,\" Elend said.\nSazed nodded. \"I fear that we may have exposed the world to\nsomething when we killed the Lord Ruler, Your Majesty.

He looked\ndown as he spoke, as if embarrassed. \"I have been performing an\ninvestigation, you might say. You see, I have heard numerous reports of the\nmists coming during the daytime.\"\nHam shrugged. \"That happens sometimes. There are foggy days,\nespecially in the fall.\"\n\"That is not what I mean, Lord Hammond,\" Sazed said. \"There is a\ndifference between the mist and ordinary fog. It is difficult to spot, perhaps,\nbut it is noticeable to a careful eye. The mist is thicker, and. . .well. . .\"\n\"It moves in larger patterns,\" Vin said quietly. \"Like rivers in the sky. It\nnever just hangs in one place; it floats in the breeze, almost like it makes the\nbreeze.\"\n\"And it can't enter buildings,\" Clubs said. \"Or tents. It evaporates soon\nafter it does.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said. \"When I first heard these reports of day mist, I\nassumed that the people were just letting their superstitions get out of\ncontrol. I have known many skaa who refused to go out on a foggy\nmorning. However, I was curious about the reports, so I traced them to a\nvillage in the South. I taught there for some time, and never received\nconfirmation of the stories. So, I made my way from that place.\"\nHe paused, frowning slightly. \"Your Majesty, please do not think me\nmad. During those travels I passed a secluded valley, and saw what I swear\nwas mist, not fog. It was moving across the landscape, creeping toward me.\nDuring the full light of day.\"\nElend glanced at Ham. He shrugged. \"Don't look at me.\"\nBreeze snorted. \"He was asking your opinion, my dear man.\"\n\"Well, I don't have one.\"\n\"Some philosopher you are.\"\n\"I'm not a philosopher,\" Ham said. \"I just like to think about things.\"\n\"Well, think about this, then,\" Breeze said.\nElend glanced at Sazed. \"Have those two always been this way?\"\n\"Honestly, I am not certain, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said, smiling\nslightly. \"I have known them for only slightly longer than yourself.\"\n\"Yes, they've always been like this,\" Dockson said, sighing quietly. \"If\nanything, they've gotten worse over the years.\"\n\"Aren't you hungry?\" Elend asked, nodding to Sazed's plate.\n\"I can eat once our discussion is finished,\" Sazed said.\n\"Sazed, you're not a servant anymore,\" Vin said. \"You don't have to\nworry about things like that.\"\n\"It is not a matter of serving or not, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said. \"It is a\nmatter of being polite.\"\n\"Sazed,\" Elend said.\n\"Yes, Your Majesty?\""

They all agree that\nthe mist has been killing people.\"\n\"That's preposterous,\" Breeze said. \"Mist is harmless.\"\n\"That is what I thought, Lord Ladrian,\" Sazed said. \"However, several\nof the reports are quite detailed. The incidents always occurred during the\nday, and each one tells of the mist curling around some unfortunate\nindividual, who then died—usually in a seizure. I gathered interviews with\nwitnesses myself.\"\nElend frowned. From another man, he'd dismiss the news. But Sazed. .\n.he was not a man that one dismissed. Vin, sitting beside Elend, watched the\nconversation with interest, chewing slightly on her bottom lip. Oddly, she\ndidn't object to Sazed's words—though the others seemed to be reacting as\nBreeze had.\n\"It doesn't make sense, Saze,\" Ham said. \"Thieves, nobles, and\nAllomancers have gone out in the mists for centuries.\"\n\"Indeed they have, Lord Hammond,\" Sazed said with a nod. \"The only\nexplanation I can think of involves the Lord Ruler. I heard no substantive\nreports of mist deaths before the Collapse, but I have had little trouble\nfinding them since. The reports are concentrated in the Outer Dominances,\nbut the incidents appear to be moving inward.

Mist doesn't kill.\"\n\"I can only report what I have discovered,\" Sazed said. \"I will need to\ndo some more research.\"\n\"So, you'll be staying?\" Vin asked, obviously hopeful.\nSazed nodded.\n\"What about teaching?\" Breeze asked, waving his hand. \"When you\nleft, I recall that you said something about spending the rest of your life\ntraveling, or some nonsense like that.\"\nSazed blushed slightly, glancing down again. \"That duty will have to\nwait, I fear.\"\n\"You're welcome to stay as long as you want, Sazed,\" Elend said,\nshooting a glare at Breeze. \"If what you say is true, then you'll be doing a\ngreater service through your studies than you would by traveling.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Sazed said.\n\"Though,\" Ham noted with a chuckle, \"you probably could have\npicked a safer place to set up shop—one that isn't being pushed around by\ntwo armies and twenty thousand koloss.\"\nSazed smiled, and Elend gave an obligatory chuckle. He said that the\nincidents involving the mist were moving inward, toward the center of the\nempire. Toward us.\nSomething else to worry about.\n\"What's going on?\" a voice suddenly asked. Elend turned toward the\nkitchen doorway, where a disheveled-looking Allrianne stood. \"I heard\nvoices. Is there a party?\"\n\"We were just discussing matters of state interest, my dear,\" Breeze\nsaid quickly.\n\"The other girl is here,\" Allrianne said, pointing at Vin. \"Why didn't\nyou invite me?\"\nElend frowned. She heard voices? The guest quarters aren't anywhere\nnear the kitchens. And Allrianne was dressed, wearing a simple\nnoblewoman's gown. She'd taken the time to get out of her sleeping\nclothing, but she'd left her hair disheveled. Perhaps to make herself look\nmore innocent?\nI'm starting to think like Vin, Elend told himself with a sigh. As if to\ncorroborate his thoughts, he noticed Vin narrowing her eyes at the new girl.\n\"Go back to your rooms, dear,\" Breeze said soothingly. \"Don't trouble\nHis Majesty.\"\nAllrianne sighed dramatically, but turned and did as he asked, trailing\noff into the hallway. Elend turned back to Sazed, who was watching the girl\nwith a curious expression. Elend gave him an \"ask later\" look, and the\nTerrisman turned back to his meal. A few moments later, the group began to\nbreak up. Vin hung back with Elend as the others left.\n\"I don't trust that girl,\" Vin said as a couple of servants took Sazed's\npack and guided him away.\nElend smiled, turning to look down at Vin. \"Do I have to say it?\"\nShe rolled her eyes. \"I know. 'You don't trust anyone, Vin.' This time\nI'm right. She was dressed, but her hair was disheveled. She must have done\nthat intentionally.\"\n\"I noticed.\"\n\"You did?\" She sounded impressed."

Besides, I was a little\ndistracted by what Sazed was saying.\"\n\"And what do you think of it?\"\nVin paused. \"I'll tell you later.\"\n\"All right,\" Elend said. To Vin's side, the kandra rose and stretched its\nwolfhound body. Why did she insist on bringing OreSeur to the meeting? he\nwondered. Wasn't it just a few weeks ago that she couldn't stand the thing?\nThe wolfhound turned, glancing at the kitchen windows.

He watched her go, wondering\nwhy she had been so interested in Sazed's stories, wondering what it was\nshe wasn't telling him.\nStop it, he told himself. Perhaps he was learning her lessons a little too\nwell—of all the people in the palace, Vin was the last one he needed to be\nparanoid about. However, every time he felt like he was beginning to figure\nVin out, he realized just how little he understood her.\nAnd that made everything else seem a little more depressing. With a\nsigh, he turned to seek out his rooms, where his half-finished letter to the\nAssembly waited to be completed.\nPerhaps I should not have spoken of the mists, Sazed thought,\nfollowing a servant up the stairs. Now I've troubled the king about\nsomething that might just be my delusion.\nThey reached the top of the stairs, and the servant asked if he wished a\nbath drawn. Sazed shook his head. In most other circumstances he would\nhave welcomed the opportunity to get clean. However, running all the way\nto the Central Dominance, being captured by the koloss, then marching the\nrest of the way up to Luthadel had left him wearied to the farthest fringe of\nexhaustion.

He watched the man walk away, holding only a candle, his\nlamp left for Sazed to use. During most of Sazed's life, he had belonged to a\nclass of servants prized for their refined sense of duty and decorum. He'd\nbeen in charge of households and manors, supervising servants just like the\none who had led him to his rooms.\nAnother life, he thought.

We must press forward, traveling as\nmuch as we can each day—but when I finally lie down, I find sleep elusive.\nThe same thoughts that trouble me during the day are only compounded by\nthe stillness of night.\nAnd, above it all, I hear the thumping sounds from above, the pulsings\nfrom the mountains. Drawing me closer with each beat.\nShe shivered. She had asked one of Elend's seekers to burn bronze, and\nhe had claimed to hear nothing from the north. Either he was the kandra,\nlying to her about his ability to burn bronze, or Vin could hear a rhythm that\nnobody else could. Nobody except a man a thousand years dead.\nA man everyone had assumed was the Hero of Ages.\nYou're being silly, she told herself, refolding the paper. Jumping to\nconclusions. To her side, OreSeur rustled, lying quietly and staring out over\nthe city.\nAnd yet, she kept thinking of Sazed's words. Something was\nhappening with the mists. Something was wrong.\nZane didn't find her atop Keep Hasting.\nHe stopped in the mists, standing quietly. He'd expected to find her\nwaiting, for this was the place of their last fight. Even thinking of the event\nmade him tense with anticipation.\nDuring the months of sparring, they had always met again at the place\nwhere he'd eventually lost her. Yet, he'd returned to this location on several\nnights, and had never found her. He frowned, thinking of Straff's orders,\nand of necessity.\nEventually, he would likely be ordered to kill this girl. He wasn't\ncertain what bothered him more—his growing reluctance to consider such\nan act, or his growing worry that he might not actually be able to beat her.\nShe could be it, he thought. The thing that finally lets me resist. The\nthing that convinces me to just. . .leave.\nHe couldn't explain why he needed a reason. Part of him simply"

Zane wouldn't be able to leave until he knew he had someone else\nto rely on.\nHe turned away from Keep Hasting. He'd had enough of waiting; it\nwas time to seek her out. Zane threw a coin, bounding across the city for a\ntime. And, sure enough, there she was: sitting atop Keep Venture, watching\nover his foolish brother.\nZane rounded the keep, keeping far enough away that even tin-\nenhanced eyes wouldn't see him. He landed on the back of the keep's roof,\nthen walked forward quietly. He approached, watching her sit on the edge\nof the roof. The air was silent.\nFinally, she turned around, jumping slightly. He swore that she could\nsense him when she shouldn't be able to.\nEither way, he was discovered.\n\"Zane,\" Vin said flatly, easily identifying the silhouette. He wore his\ncustomary black on black, with no mistcloak.\n\"I've been waiting,\" he said quietly. \"Atop Keep Hasting. Hoping you'd\ncome.\"\nShe sighed, careful to keep an eye on him, but relaxing slightly. \"I'm\nnot really in the mood for sparring right now.\"\nHe watched her. \"Pity,\" he finally said. He walked over, prompting Vin\nto rise cautiously to her feet. He paused beside the lip of the rooftop,\nlooking down at Elend's lit balcony.\nVin glanced at OreSeur. He was tense, alternately watching her and\nZane.\n\"You're so worried about him,\" Zane said quietly.\n\"Elend?\" Vin asked.\nZane nodded. \"Even though he uses you.\"\n\"We've had this discussion, Zane. He isn't using me.\"\nZane looked up at her, meeting her eyes, standing straight-backed and\nconfident in the night.\nHe's so strong, she thought. So sure of himself. So different from. . .\nShe stopped herself.\nZane turned away. \"Tell me, Vin,\" he said, \"when you were younger,\ndid you ever wish for power?\"\nVin cocked her head, frowning at the strange question. \"What do you\nmean?\"\n\"You grew up on the streets,\" Zane said. \"When you were younger, did\nyou wish for power? Did you dream of having the ability to free yourself, to\nkill those who brutalized you?\"\n\"Of course I did,\" Vin said.\n\"And now you have that power,\" Zane said. \"What would the child Vin\nsay if she could see you? A Mistborn who is bent and bowed by the weight\nof another's will? Powerful, yet somehow still subservient?\"\n\"I'm a different person now, Zane,\" Vin said. \"I'd like to think that I've\nlearned things since I was a child.\"\n\"I've found that a child's instincts are often the most honest,\" Zane\nsaid. \"The most natural.\"\nVin didn't respond.\nZane turned quietly, looking out over the city, seemingly unconcerned"

Vin eyed him, then dropped a coin. It\nplinked against the metal rooftop, and he immediately glanced back toward\nher.\nNo, she thought, he doesn't trust me.\nHe turned away again, and Vin watched him. She did understand what\nhe meant, for she had once thought as he did. Idly, she wondered what kind\nof person she might have become if she'd gained full access to her powers\nwithout—at the same time—learning of friendship and trust from Kelsier's\ncrew.\n\"What would you do, Vin?\" Zane asked, turning back toward her.\n\"Assuming you didn't have any constraints—assuming there were no\nrepercussions for your actions?\"\nGo north. The thought was immediate. Find out what is causing that\nthumping. She didn't say it, however. \"I don't know,\" she said instead.\nHe turned, eyeing her. \"You aren't taking me seriously, I see. I\napologize for wasting your time.\"\nHe turned to go, walking directly between her and OreSeur. Vin\nwatched him, and felt a sudden stab of concern. He'd come to her, willing to\ntalk rather than just fight—and she'd wasted the opportunity. She was never\ngoing to turn him to her side if she didn't talk to him.\n\"You want to know what I'd do?\" she asked, her voice ringing in the\nsilent mists.\nZane paused.\n\"If I could just use my power as I wanted?\" Vin asked. \"No\nrepercussions? I'd protect him.\"\n\"Your king?\" Zane asked, turning.\nVin nodded sharply. \"These men who brought armies against him—\nyour master, this man named Cett. I'd kill them. I'd use my power to make\ncertain that nobody could threaten Elend.\"\nZane nodded quietly, and she saw respect in his eyes. \"And why don't\nyou?\"\n\"Because. . .\"\n\"I see the confusion in your eyes,\" Zane said. \"You know that your\ninstincts to kill those men are right—yet you hold back. Because of him.\"\n\"There would be repercussions, Zane,\" Vin said. \"If I killed those men,\ntheir armies might just attack. Right now, diplomacy could still work.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Zane said. \"Until he asks you to go kill someone for him.\"\nVin snorted. \"Elend doesn't work that way. He doesn't give me orders,\nand the only people I kill are the ones who try to kill him first.\"\n\"Oh?\" Zane said. \"You may not act at his order, Vin, but you certainly\nrefrain from action at it. You are his toy. I don't say this to insult you—you\nsee, I'm as much a toy as you are. Neither of us can break free. Not alone.\"\nSuddenly, the coin Vin had dropped snapped into the air, flying toward\nZane. She tensed, but it simply streaked into Zane's waiting hand.\n\"It's interesting,\" he said, turning the coin in his fingers. \"Many\nMistborn stop seeing the value in coins.

It's easy to forget the value of something\nwhen you use it so often. When it becomes commonplace and convenient to\nyou. When it becomes. . .just a tool.\"\nHe flipped the coin up, then shot it out into the night. \"I must go,\" he\nsaid, turning.\nVin raised a hand. Seeing him use Allomancy made her realize that\nthere was another reason she wanted to speak with him. It had been so long\nsince she'd talked with another Mistborn, one who understood her powers.\nSomeone like her.\nBut, it seemed to her that she was too desperate for him to stay. So she\nlet him go, and returned to her vigil.\nHe fathered no children, yet all of the land became his progeny.\n25\nVIN WAS A VERY LIGHT sleeper—a heritage from her youth.\nThieving crews worked together out of necessity, and any man who couldn't\nguard his own possessions was considered to be unworthy of them. Vin, of\ncourse, had been at the very bottom of the hierarchy—and while she hadn't\nhad many possessions to protect, being a young girl in a primarily male\nenvironment gave her other reasons to be a light sleeper.\nSo it was that when she awoke to a quiet bark of warning, she reacted\nwithout thinking. She tossed off her covers, reaching immediately for the\nvial on her bedstand. She didn't sleep with metals inside of her; many of the\nAllomantic metals were, to some small extent, poisonous. It was\nunavoidable that she'd have to deal with some of that danger, but she had\nbeen warned to burn away excess metals at the end of each day.\nShe downed this vial even as she reached for the obsidian daggers\nhidden beneath her pillow. The door to her sleeping chamber swung open,\nand Tindwyl walked in. The Terriswoman froze in midstep as she saw Vin\ncrouching on the bed's footboard a few feet away, twin daggers glistening,\nbody tense.\nTindwyl raised an eyebrow. \"So you are awake.\"\n\"Now.\"\nThe Terriswoman smiled.\n\"What are you doing in my rooms?\" Vin demanded.\n\"I came to wake you. I thought we might go shopping.\"\n\"Shopping?\"\n\"Yes, dear,\" Tindwyl said, walking over to pull open the curtains. It\nwas far earlier in the day than Vin usually rose. \"From what I hear, you're\ngoing to meet with His Majesty's father on the morrow. You'll want a\nsuitable dress for the occasion, I assume?\"\n\"I don't wear dresses anymore.\" What is your game?\nTindwyl turned, eyeing Vin. \"You sleep in your clothing?\"\nVin nodded.\n\"You don't keep any ladies-in-waiting?\"\nVin shook her head.\n\"Very well, then,\" Tindwyl said, turning to walk from the room. \"Bathe\nand change. We'll leave when you're ready.\"\n\"I don't take commands from you.\"\nTindwyl paused by the door, turning. Then her face softened. \"I know\nyou don't, child. You may come with me if you wish—the choice is yours."

You may come with me if you wish—the choice is yours.\nHowever, do you really want to meet with Straff Venture in trousers and a\nshirt?\"\nVin hesitated.\n\"At least come browse,\" Tindwyl said. \"It will help take your mind off\nthings.\"\nFinally, Vin nodded. Tindwyl smiled again, then left.\nVin glanced at OreSeur, who sat beside her bed. \"Thanks for the\nwarning.\"\nThe kandra shrugged.\nOnce, Vin wouldn't have been able to imagine living in a place like\nKeep Venture. The young Vin had been accustomed to hidden lairs, skaa\nhovels, and the occasional alley. Now she lived in a building bespeckled\nwith stained glass, bounded by mighty walls and grand archways.\nOf course, Vin thought as she left the stairwell, many things have\nhappened that I didn't expect. Why think about them now?\nHer youth in the thieving crews had been much on her mind of late,\nand Zane's comments—ridiculous though they were—itched in her mind.\nDid Vin belong in a place like this keep? She had a great many skills, but\nfew of them were beautiful hallway kinds of skills. They were more. . .ash-\nstained alleyway kinds of skills.\nShe sighed, OreSeur at her side as she made her way to the southern\nentryway, where Tindwyl said she'd be waiting. The hallway here grew\nwide and grand, and opened directly into the courtyard. Usually, coaches\ncame right up into the entryway to pick up their occupants—that way the\nnoblemen wouldn't be exposed to the elements.\nAs she approached, her tin let her hear voices. One was Tindwyl, the\nother. . .\n\"I didn't bring much,\" Allrianne said. \"A couple hundred boxings. But I\ndo so need something to wear. I can't survive on borrowed gowns forever!\"\nVin paused as she turned into the last part of the hallway.\n\"The king's gift will surely be enough to pay for a dress, dear,\"\nTindwyl said, noticing Vin. \"Ah, here she is.\"\nA sullen-looking Spook stood with the two women. He had on his\npalace guard's uniform, though he wore the jacket undone and the trousers\nloose. Vin walked forward slowly. \"I wasn't expecting company,\" she said.\n\"Young Allrianne was trained as a courtly noblewoman,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"She will know the current fashions, and will be able to advise on your\npurchases.\"\n\"And Spook?\"\nTindwyl turned, eyeing the boy. \"Packman.\"\nWell, that explains his mood, Vin thought.\n\"Come,\" Tindwyl said, walking toward the courtyard. Allrianne\nfollowed quickly, walking with a light, graceful step. Vin glanced at Spook,\nwho shrugged, and they followed as well.\n\"How did you get pulled into this?\" Vin whispered to Spook.\n\"Was up too early, sneaking food,\" Spook grumbled. \"Miss Imposing\nthere noticed me, smiled like a wolfhound, and said, 'We'll be needing your\nservices this afternoon, young man.'\""

Remember, we're at\nwar.\"\nSpook obediently did what she said. Standing close to him as she was,\nVin easily picked up and identified his tin's Allomantic pulses—meaning he\nwasn't the spy.\nAnother one off the list, Vin thought. At least this trip won't be a total\nwaste.\nA coach waited for them by the front keep gates. Spook climbed up\nbeside the coachman, and the women piled into the back. Vin sat down\ninside, and OreSeur climbed in and took the seat next to her. Allrianne and\nTindwyl sat across from her, and Allrianne eyed OreSeur with a frown,\nwrinkling her nose. \"Does the animal have to sit on the seats with us?\"\n\"Yes,\" Vin said as the carriage started moving.\nAllrianne obviously expected more of an explanation, but Vin didn't\ngive one. Finally, Allrianne turned to look out the window. \"Are you sure\nwe'll be safe, traveling with only one manservant, Tindwyl?\"\nTindwyl eyed Vin. \"Oh, I think that we'll be all right.\"\n\"Oh, that's right,\" Allrianne said, looking back at Vin. \"You're an\nAllomancer! Are the things they say true?\"\n\"What things?\" Vin asked quietly.\n\"Well, they say you killed the Lord Ruler, for one. And that you're kind\nof. . .um. . .well.\" Allrianne bit her lip. \"Well, just a little bit rickety.\"\n\"Rickety?\"\n\"And dangerous,\" Allrianne said. \"But, well, that can't be true. I mean,\nyou're going shopping with us, right?\"\nIs she trying to provoke me on purpose?\n\"Do you always wear clothing like that?\" Allrianne asked.\nVin was in her standard gray trousers and tan shirt. \"It's easy to fight\nin.\"\n\"Yes, but. . .well.\" Allrianne smiled. \"I guess that's why we're here\ntoday, right, Tindwyl?\"\n\"Yes, dear,\" Tindwyl said. She'd been studying Vin through the entire\nconversation.\nLike what you see? Vin thought. What is it you want?\n\"You have to be the strangest noblewoman I've ever met,\" Allrianne\ndeclared. \"Did you grow up far from court? I did, but my mother was quite\ncertain to train me well. Of course, she was just trying to make me into a\ngood catch so Father could auction me off to make an alliance.\"\nAllrianne smiled. It had been a while since Vin had been forced to deal\nwith women like her. She remembered hours spent at court, smiling,\npretending to be Valette Renoux. Often when she thought of those days, she\nremembered the bad things. The spite she'd faced from court members, her\nown lack of comfort in the role.\nBut, there had also been good things.

The graceful dancing, the careful interactions, the\nperfectly decorated rooms. . .\nThose things are gone now, she told herself. We don't have time for\nsilly balls and gatherings, not when the dominance is on the verge of\ncollapse.\nTindwyl was still watching her.\n\"Well?\" Allrianne asked.\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\n\"Did you grow up far from court?\"\n\"I'm not noble, Allrianne. I'm skaa.\"\nAllrianne paled, then flushed, then raised her fingers to her lips. \"Oh!\nYou poor thing!\" Vin's augmented ears heard something beside her—a light\nchuckling from OreSeur, soft enough that only an Allomancer could have\nheard him.\nShe resisted the urge to shoot the kandra a flat look. \"It wasn't so bad,\"\nshe said.\n\"But, well, no wonder you don't know how to dress!\" Allrianne said.\n\"I know how to dress,\" Vin said. \"I even own a few gowns.\" Not that\nI've put one on in months. . ..\nAllrianne nodded, though she obviously didn't believe Vin's comment.\n\"Breezy is skaa, too,\" she said quietly. \"Or, half skaa. He told me. Good\nthing he didn't tell Father—Father never has been very nice to skaa.\"\nVin didn't reply.\nEventually, they reached Kenton Street, and the crowds made the\ncarriage a liability. Vin climbed out first, OreSeur hopping down to the\ncobblestones beside her. The market street was busy, though not as packed\nas it had been the last time she'd visited. Vin glanced over the prices at\nsome nearby shops as the others exited the coach.\nFive boxings for a bin of aging apples, Vin thought with\ndissatisfaction. Food is already going at a premium. Elend had stores,\nfortunately. But how long would they last before the siege? Not through the\napproaching winter, certainly—not with so much of the dominance's grain\nstill unharvested in the outer plantations.\nTime may be our friend now, Vin thought, but it will turn on us\neventually. They had to get those armies to fight each other. Otherwise, the\ncity's people might die of starvation before the soldiers even tried to take\nthe walls.\nSpook hopped down from the carriage, joining them as Tindwyl\nsurveyed the street. Vin eyed the bustling crowds. The people were\nobviously trying to go about their daily activities, despite the threat from\noutside. What else could they do? The siege had already lasted for weeks.\nLife had to go on.\n\"There,\" Tindwyl said, pointing to a dressmaker's shop.\nAllrianne scampered forward. Tindwyl followed behind, walking with\nmodest decorum. \"Eager young thing, isn't she?\" the Terriswoman asked.\nVin shrugged.

She is a product of\nher upbringing, just as you are. If you judge her worth based on frivolities,\nthen you are doing the same as those who judge you based on your simple\nclothing.\"\n\"I like it when people judge me based on my simple clothing,\" Vin\nsaid. \"Then they don't expect too much.\"\n\"I see,\" Tindwyl said. \"Then, you haven't missed this at all?\" She\nnodded toward the shop's inner room.\nVin paused.

Everything was powdered with a light perfume.\nStanding before the dressing dummies in their brilliant hues, Vin was—for\njust a moment—again taken back to the balls. Back to when she was\nValette. Back to when she had an excuse to be Valette.\n\"They say you enjoyed noble society,\" Tindwyl said lightly, walking\nforward. Allrianne was already standing near the front of the room, running\nher fingers across a bolt of fabric, talking to the dressmaker in a firm voice.\n\"Who told you that?\" Vin asked.\nTindwyl turned back. \"Why, your friends, dear. It's quite curious—they\nsay you stopped wearing dresses a few months after the Collapse. They all\nwonder why. They say you seemed to like dressing like a woman, but I\nguess they were wrong.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said quietly. \"They were right.\"\nTindwyl raised an eyebrow, pausing beside a dressmaker's dummy in a\nbright green dress, edged with lace, the bottom flaring wide with several\nunderskirts.\nVin approached, looking up at the gorgeous costume. \"I was beginning\nto like dressing like this.

Of course, during those times, she had\nmostly been addressing Elend.\n\"That topic is not your concern,\" Vin said.\n\"The king has asked me to help him improve his image,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"And I have taken it upon myself to do more than that—I want to make a\nreal king of him, if I can.

That is a talent many lack.\n\"Your king is a humble scholar and thinker, but he has the will of a\nwarrior. He is a man who has the nerve to fight, and I think—perhaps—you\nhave yet to see the best of him. The Soother Breeze is a cynical, mocking\nman—until he looks at young Allrianne.

Now, go let the man take your measurements so you can try on some\nstock dresses.\"\nWhoever I am? Vin thought, frowning. However, she let the tall\nTerriswoman push her forward, and the elderly dressmaker took his tape\nand began to measure.\nA few moments and a changing room later, Vin stepped back into the\nroom wearing a memory. Silky blue with white lace, the gown was tight at\nthe waist and through the bust, but had a large, flowing bottom. The\nnumerous skirts made it flare out, tapering down in a triangular shape, her\nfeet completely covered, the bottom of the skirt flush with the floor.\nIt was terribly impractical. It rustled when she moved, and she had to\nbe careful where she stepped to keep it from catching or brushing a dirty\nsurface. But it was beautiful, and it made her feel beautiful.

The old dressmaker leaned on his cane, dictating notes to a young\nassistant. \"Move around a bit more, my lady,\" he requested. \"Let me see\nhow it fits when you do more than just walk in a straight line.\"\nVin spun slightly, turning on one foot, trying to remember the dancing\nmoves Sazed had taught her.\nI never did get to dance with Elend, she realized, stepping to the side,\nas if to music she could only faintly remember. He always found an excuse\nto wiggle out of it.\nShe twirled, getting a feel for the dress. She would have thought that\nher instincts would have decayed. Now that she had one on again, however,\nshe was surprised at how easy it was to fall back into those habits—\nstepping lightly, turning so that the bottom of the dress flared just a bit. . ..\nShe paused. The dressmaker was no longer dictating. He watched her\nquietly, smiling.\n\"What?\" Vin asked, flushing.\n\"I'm sorry, my lady,\" he said, turning to tap on his assistant's notebook,\nsending the boy away with a point of his finger. \"But I don't rightly think\nI've ever seen someone move so gracefully. Like a. . .passing breath.\"\n\"You flatter me,\" Vin said.\n\"No, child,\" Tindwyl said, standing to the side. \"He's right. You move\nwith a grace that most women can only envy.\"\nThe dressmaker smiled again, turning as his assistant approached with\na group of square cloth color samples.

The old man began to sort through\nthem with a wizened hand, and Vin stepped over to Tindwyl, holding her\nhands at the sides, trying not to let the traitorous dress take control of her\nagain.\n\"Why are you being so nice to me?\" Vin demanded quietly.\n\"Why shouldn't I be?\" Tindwyl asked.\n\"Because you're mean to Elend,\" Vin said. \"Don't deny it—I've\nlistened in on your lessons. You spend the time insulting and disparaging\nhim. But now you're pretending to be nice.\"\nTindwyl smiled. \"I am not pretending, child.\"\n\"Then why are you so mean to Elend?\"\n\"The lad grew up as a pampered son of a great lord,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"Now that he's king, he needs a little harsh truth, I think.\" She paused,\nglancing down at Vin. \"I sense that you've had quite enough of that in your\nlife.\"\nThe dressmaker approached with his swatches, spreading them out on\na low table. \"Now, my lady,\" he said, tapping one group with a bent finger.\n\"I think your coloring would look particularly good with dark cloth. A nice\nmaroon, perhaps?\"\n\"What about a black?\" Vin asked.\n\"Heavens, no,\" Tindwyl said. \"Absolutely no more black or gray for\nyou, child.\"\n\"What about this one, then?\" Vin asked, pulling out a royal blue\nswatch. It was nearly the shade she'd worn the first night she'd met Elend,\nso long ago.\n\"Ah, yes,\" the dressmaker said. \"That would look wonderful against\nthat light skin and dark hair. Hum, yes. Now, we'll have to pick a style. You\nneed this by tomorrow evening, the Terriswoman said?\"\nVin nodded.\n\"Ah, then. We'll have to modify one of the stock dresses, but I think I\nhave one in this color. We'll have to take it in quite a bit, but we can work\nthrough the night for a beauty like yourself, can't we, lad? Now, as for the\nstyle. . .\"\n\"This is fine, I guess,\" Vin said, looking down. The gown was the\nstandard cut of those she'd worn at previous balls.\n\"Well, we're not looking for 'fine,' now, are we?\" the dressmaker said\nwith a smile.\n\"What if we removed some of the pettiskirts?\" Tindwyl said, pulling at\nthe sides of Vin's dress. \"And perhaps raised the hem just a bit, so that she\ncould move more freely?\"\nVin paused. \"You could do that?\"\n\"Of course,\" the dressmaker said. \"The lad says thinner skirts are more\npopular to the south, though they tend to lag in fashion a bit behind\nLuthadel.\" He paused. \"Though, I don't know that Luthadel even really has\na fashion anymore. . ..\"\n\"Make cuffs of the sleeves wide,\" Tindwyl said. \"And sew a couple of\npockets into them for certain personal items.\"\nThe old man nodded as his quiet assistant scribbled down the\nsuggestion."

The boy nodded quietly.\n\"I see. . .\" the man said, paling, hand shaking just a little bit more. He\nplaced it on the top of his cane, as if to give himself a little more stability.\n\"I'm. . .I'm sorry if I offended you, my lady. I didn't know.\"\nVin flushed again. Another reason why I shouldn't go shopping. \"No,\"\nshe said, reassuring the man. \"It's all right. You haven't offended me.\"\nHe relaxed slightly, and Vin noticed Spook strolling over.\n\"Looks like we've been found,\" Spook said, nodding to the front\nwindows.\nVin glanced past dressing dummies and bales of cloth to see a crowd\ngathering outside. Tindwyl watched Vin with curiosity.\nSpook shook his head. \"Why do you get to be so popular?\"\n\"I killed their god,\" Vin said quietly, ducking around a dressing\ndummy, hiding from the dozens of peeking eyes.\n\"I helped too,\" Spook said. \"I even got my nickname from Kelsier\nhimself! But nobody cares about poor little Spook.\"\nVin scanned the room for windows. There's got to be a back door. Of\ncourse, there might be people in the alley.\n\"What are you doing?\" Tindwyl asked.\n\"I have to go,\" Vin said. \"Get away from them.\"\n\"Why don't you go out and talk to them?\" Tindwyl asked. \"They're\nobviously very interested in seeing you.\"\nAllrianne emerged from a dressing room—wearing a gown of yellow\nand blue—and twirled dramatically. She was obviously put out when she\ndidn't even get Spook's attention.\n\"I'm not going out there,\" Vin said. \"Why would I want to do\nsomething like that?\"\n\"They need hope,\" Tindwyl said. \"Hope you can give them.\"\n\"A false hope,\" Vin said. \"I'd only encourage them to think of me as\nsome object of worship.\"\n\"That's not true,\" Allrianne said suddenly, walking forward, looking\nout the windows without the least bit of embarrassment. \"Hiding in corners,\nwearing strange clothing, and being mysterious—that's what has gotten you\nthis amazing reputation. If people knew how ordinary you were, they\nwouldn't be so crazy to get a look at you.\" She paused, then looked back. \"I.\n. .uh, didn't mean that like I think it sounded.\"\nVin flushed. \"I'm not Kelsier, Tindwyl. I don't want people to worship\nme. I just want to be left alone.\"\n\"Some people don't have that choice, child,\" Tindwyl said. \"You struck\ndown the Lord Ruler.

How am I supposed to explain it?\nTindwyl raised an eyebrow.\n\"All right,\" Vin said, sighing and walking forward.\n\"I'll go with you,\" Allrianne said, grabbing Vin's arm as if they had\nbeen friends since childhood. Vin resisted, but couldn't figure a way to pry\nher off without making a scene.\nThey stepped out of the shop. The crowd was already large, and the\nperiphery was filling as more and more people came to investigate. Most\nwere skaa in brown, ash-stained work coats or simple gray dresses. The\nones in the front backed away as Vin stepped out, giving her a little ring of\nempty space, and a murmur of awed excitement moved through the crowd.\n\"Wow,\" Allrianne said quietly. \"There sure are a lot of them. . ..\"\nVin nodded. OreSeur sat where he had before, near the door, and he\nwatched her with a curious canine expression.\nAllrianne smiled at the crowd, waving with a sudden hesitance. \"You\ncan, you know, fight them off or something if this turns messy, right?\"\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Vin said, finally slipping her arm free of\nAllrianne's grasp and giving the crowd a bit of a Soothing to calm them.\nAfter that, she stepped forward, trying to push down her sense of itching\nnervousness. She'd grown to no longer feel she needed to hide when she\nwent out in public, but standing before a crowd like this. . .well, she almost\nturned and slinked back into the dressmaker's shop.\nA voice, however, stopped her. The speaker was a middle-aged man\nwith an ash-stained beard and a dirty black cap held nervously in his hands.\nHe was a strong man, probably a mill worker. His quiet voice seemed a\ncontrast to his powerful build. \"Lady Heir. What will become of us?\"\nThe terror—the uncertainty—in the large man's voice was so piteous\nthat Vin hesitated. He regarded her with hopeful eyes, as did most of the\nothers.\nSo many, Vin thought. I thought the Church of the Survivor was small.\nShe looked at the man, who stood wringing his cap. She opened her mouth,\nbut then. . .couldn't do it. She couldn't tell him that she didn't know what\nwould happen; she couldn't explain to those eyes that she wasn't the savior\nthat he needed.\n\"Everything will be all right,\" Vin heard herself say, increasing her\nSoothing, trying to take away some of their fear.\n\"But the armies, Lady Heir!\" one of the women said.\n\"They're trying to intimidate us,\" Vin said. \"But the king won't let\nthem. Our walls are strong, as are our soldiers. We can outlast this siege.\"\nThe crowd was silent.\n\"One of those armies is led by Elend's father, Straff Venture,\" Vin said.\n\"Elend and I are going to go meet with Straff tomorrow. We will persuade\nhim to be our ally.\""

He's a\npolitician!\"\nOther voices called out in agreement. Reverence disappeared as people\nbegan to yell out concerns, while others began to demand help. The\ndissidents continued to rail against Elend, yelling that there was no way he\ncould protect them.\nVin raised her hands to her ears. Trying to ward off the crowd, the\nchaos. \"Stop!\" she yelled, Pushing out with steel and brass. Several people\nstumbled back away from her, and she could see a wave in the crowd as\nbuttons, coins, and buckles suddenly pressed backward.\nThe people grew suddenly quiet.\n\"I will suffer no ill words spoken of our king!\" Vin said, flaring her\nbrass and increasing her Soothing. \"He is a good man, and a good leader.\nHe has sacrificed much for you—your freedom comes because of his long\nhours spent drafting laws, and your livelihoods come because of his work\nsecuring trade routes and agreements with merchants.\"\nMany members of the crowd looked down. The bearded man at the\nfront continued to twist his cap, however, looking at Vin. \"They're just right\nfrightened, Lady Heir. Right frightened.\"\n\"We'll protect you,\" Vin said. What am I saying? \"Elend and I, we'll\nfind a way. We stopped the Lord Ruler. We can stop these armies. . .\" She\ntrailed off, feeling foolish.\nYet, the crowd responded. Some were obviously still unsatisfied, but\nmany seemed calmed. The crowd began to break up, though some of its\nmembers came forward, leading or carrying small children. Vin paused\nnervously. Kelsier had often met with and held the children of the skaa, as if\ngiving them his blessing. She bid the group a hasty farewell and ducked\nback into the shop, pulling Allrianne after her.\nTindwyl waited inside, nodding with satisfaction.\n\"I lied,\" Vin said, pushing the door closed.\n\"No you didn't,\" Tindwyl said. \"You were optimistic. The truth or\nfiction of what you said has yet to be proven.\"\n\"It won't happen,\" Vin said. \"Elend can't defeat three armies, not even\nwith my help.\"\nTindwyl raised an eyebrow. \"Then you should leave. Run away, leave\nthe people to deal with the armies themselves.\"\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Vin said.\n\"Well, make a decision then,\" Tindwyl said. \"Either give up on the city\nor believe in it. Honestly, the pair of you. . ..\" She shook her head.\n\"I thought you weren't going to be harsh with me,\" Vin noted.\n\"I have trouble with that sometimes,\" Tindwyl said. \"Come, Allrianne.\nLet's finish your fitting.\"\nThey moved to do so.

However, at that moment—as if to belie Vin's\nassurances of safety—several warning drums began to beat atop the city\nwall.\nVin froze, glancing through the window, out over the anxious crowd.\nOne of the armies was attacking. Cursing the delay, she rushed into the\nback of the shop to change out of the bulky dress.\nElend scrambled up the steps to the city wall, nearly tripping on his\ndueling cane in his haste. He stumbled out of the stairwell, moving onto the\nwall top, rearranging the cane at his side with a curse.\nThe wall top was in chaos. Men scrambled about, calling to each other.\nSome had forgotten their armor, others their bows. So many tried to get up\nafter Elend that the stairwell got clogged, and he watched hopelessly as men\ncrowded around the openings below, creating an even larger jam of bodies\nin the courtyard.\nElend spun, watching a large group of Straff's men—thousands of\nthem—rush toward the wall. Elend stood near Tin Gate, at the north of the\ncity, nearest Straff's army. He could see a separate group of soldiers rushing\ntoward Pewter Gate, a little to the east.\n\"Archers!\" Elend yelled. \"Men, where are your bows?\"\nHis voice, however, was lost in the shouting. Captains moved about,\ntrying to organize the men, but apparently too many footmen had come to\nthe wall, leaving a lot of the archers trapped in the courtyard below.\nWhy? Elend thought desperately, turning back toward the charging\narmy. Why is he attacking? We had an a agreement to meet!\nHad he, perhaps, gotten wind of Elend's plan to play both sides of the\nconflict? Perhaps there really was a spy in the inner crew.\nEither way, Elend could only watch hopelessly as the army approached\nhis wall. One captain managed to get off a pathetic volley of arrows, but it\ndidn't do much good. As the army approached, arrows began to zip up\ntoward the wall, mixed with flying coins. Straff had Allomancers in the\ngroup.\nElend cursed, ducking down below a merlon as coins bounced against\nthe stonework. A few soldiers fell. Elend's soldiers. Killed because he'd\nbeen too proud to surrender the city.\nHe peeked carefully over the wall. A group of men carrying a battering\nram were approaching, their bodies carefully protected by men with shields.\nThe care probably meant that the rammers were Thugs, a suspicion\nconfirmed by the sound the ram made when it smashed into the gate. That\nwas not the blow of ordinary men.\nHooks followed next. Shot up toward the wall by Coinshots below,\nfalling far more accurately than if they'd been thrown. Soldiers moved to\npull them off, but coins shot up, taking the men almost as quickly as they\nmade the attempt. The gate continued to thump beneath him, and he\ndoubted it would last for long.\nAnd so we fall, Elend thought. With barely a hint of resistance.\nAnd there was nothing he could do. He felt impotent, forced to keep\nducking down lest his white uniform make him a target. All of his"

He felt impotent, forced to keep\nducking down lest his white uniform make him a target. All of his\npoliticking, all of his preparations, all of his dreams and his plans. Gone.\nAnd then Vin was there. She landed atop the wall, breathing hard,\namid a group of wounded men. Coins and arrows that came near to her\ndeflected back out into the air. Men rallied around her, moving to remove\nhooks and pull the wounded to safety. Her knives cut ropes, dropping them\nback down below. She met Elend's eyes, looking determined, then moved as\nif to leap over the side of the wall and confront the Thugs with their\nbattering ram.\nElend raised a hand, but someone else spoke.\n\"Vin, wait!\" Clubs bellowed, bursting out of the stairwell.\nShe paused. Elend had never heard such a forceful command from the\ngnarled general.\nArrows stopped flying. The booming calmed. Elend stood hesitantly,\nwatching with a frown as the army retreated back across the ash-strewn\nfields toward their camp. They left a couple of corpses behind; Elend's men\nhad actually managed to hit a few with their arrows. His own army had\ntaken far heavier casualties: some two dozen men appeared to be wounded.\n\"What. . .?\" Elend asked, turning to Clubs.\n\"They weren't putting up scaling ladders,\" Clubs said, eyeing the\nretreating force. \"This wasn't an actual attack.\"\n\"What was it then?\" Vin asked, frowning.\n\"A test,\" Clubs said. \"It's common in warfare—a quick skirmish to see\nhow your enemy responds, to feel out their tactics and preparations.\"\nElend turned, watching the disorganized soldiers make way for healers\nto care for the wounded. \"A test,\" he said, glancing at Clubs. \"My guess is\nthat we didn't do very well.\"\nClubs shrugged. \"Far worse than we should have. Maybe this will\nscare the lads into paying better attention during drills.\" He paused, and\nElend could see something he wasn't expressing. Worry.\nElend glanced out over the wall, watching the retreating army.\nSuddenly, it made sense. It was exactly the kind of move that his father\nliked to make.\nThe meeting with Straff would take place as planned. However, before\nit happened, Straff wanted Elend to know something.\nI can take this city any time, the attack seemed to say. It's mine, no\nmatter what you do. Remember that.\nHe was forced into war by a misunderstanding—and always claimed\nhe was no warrior—yet he came to fight as well as any man.\n26\n\"THIS IS NOT A GOOD idea, Mistress.\" OreSeur sat on his haunches,\nwatching Vin unpack a large, flat box.\n\"Elend thinks it's the only way,\" she said, pulling off the top of the\nbox. The luxurious blue dress lay wrapped within. She pulled it out, noting\nits comparatively light weight. She walked over to the changing screen and\nbegan to disrobe.\n\"And the assault on the walls yesterday?\" OreSeur asked.\n\"That was a warning,\" she said, continuing to unbutton her shirt. \"Not"

Clubs could say all he wished about\nstrategy and testing the walls, but from Vin's standpoint, the thing Straff had\ngained most was even more fear and chaos inside Luthadel.\nOnly a few weeks of being besieged, and the city was already strained\nnear to breaking. Food was terribly expensive, and Elend had been forced to\nopen the city stockpiles. The people were on edge. Some few thought the\nattack had been a victory for Luthadel, taking it as a good sign that the army\nhad been \"repelled.\" Most, however, were simply even more scared than\nthey had been before.\nBut, again, Vin was left with a conundrum. How to react, facing such\nan overpowering force? Cower, or try to continue with life? Straff had\ntested the walls, true—but he had maintained the larger part of his army\nback and in position, should Cett have tried to make an opportunistic attack\nat that time. He'd wanted information, and he'd wanted to intimidate the\ncity.\n\"I still don't know if this meeting is a good idea,\" OreSeur said. \"The\nattack aside, Straff is not a man to be trusted. Kelsier had me study all of the\nmajor noblemen in the city when I was preparing to become Lord Renoux.\nStraff is deceitful and harsh, even for a human.\"\nVin sighed, removing her trousers, then pulled on the dress's slip. It\nwasn't as tight as some, and gave her a lot of room to move through the\nthigh and legs. Good so far.\nOreSeur's objection was logical. One of the first things she had learned\non the street was to avoid situations where it was difficult to flee. Her every\ninstinct rebelled at the idea of walking into Straff's camp.\nElend had made his decision, however. And, Vin understood that she\nneeded to support him. In fact, she was even coming to agree with the\nmove. Straff wanted to intimidate the entire city—but he really wasn't as\nthreatening as he thought. Not as long as he had to worry about Cett.\nVin had had enough of intimidation in her life. In a way, Straff's attack\non the walls left her feeling even more determined to manipulate him to\ntheir own ends. Going into his camp seemed a bit crazy on first impression,\nbut the more she thought about it, the more she realized that it was the only\nway they were going to get to Straff. He had to see them as weak, had to\nfeel that his bullying tactics had worked. That was the only way they would\nwin.\nThat meant doing something she didn't like. It meant being\nsurrounded, entering the enemy's den. However, if Elend did manage to get\nout of the camp safely, it would provide a large morale boost for the city.\nBeyond that, it would make Ham and the rest of the crew more confident in\nElend.

Nobody would even have questioned the idea of Kelsier entering an\nenemy camp to negotiate; in fact, they probably would have expected him\nto come back from the negotiations somehow having convinced Straff to\nsurrender.\nI just need to make sure he comes back out safely, Vin thought, pulling\non the dress. Straff can display all the muscle he wants—none of it will\nmatter if we're the ones directing his attacks.\nShe nodded to herself, smoothing her dress. Then she walked out from\nbehind the changing screen, studying herself in her mirror. Though the\ndressmaker had obviously sewn it to retain a traditional form, it didn't have\na completely triangular bell shape, but instead fell a bit straighter down\nalong her thighs. It was cut open near the shoulders—though it had tight\nsleeves and open cuffs—and the waist bent with her and gave her a good\nrange of motion.\nVin stretched a bit, jumping, twisting. She was surprised at how light\nthe dress felt, and how well she moved in it. Of course, any skirt would\nhardly be ideal for fighting—but this one would be an enormous\nimprovement over the bulky creations she had worn to the parties a year\nbefore.\n\"Well?\" she asked, spinning.\nOreSeur raised a canine eyebrow. \"What?\"\n\"What do you think?\"\nOreSeur cocked his head. \"Why ask me?\"\n\"Because I care what you think,\" Vin said.\n\"The dress is very nice, Mistress. Though, to be honest, I have always\nfound the garments to be a little ridiculous. All of that cloth and color, it\ndoesn't seem very practical.\"\n\"Yes, I know,\" Vin said, using a pair of sapphire barrettes to pin the\nsides of her hair back a bit from her face. \"But. . .well, I'd forgotten how\nmuch fun these things could be to wear.\"\n\"I fail to see why that would be, Mistress.\"\n\"That's because you're a man.\"\n\"Actually, I'm a kandra.\"\n\"But you're a boy kandra.\"\n\"How do you know that?\" OreSeur asked. \"Gender is not easy to tell in\nmy people, since our forms are fluid.\"\nVin looked at him, raising an eyebrow. \"I can tell.\" Then she turned\nback to her jewelry cabinet. She didn't have much; though the crew had\noutfitted her with a good sampling of jewelry during her days as Valette, she\nhad given most of it to Elend to help fund various projects. She had,\nhowever, kept a few of her favorites—as if she'd known that she'd someday\nfind her way back into a dress.\nI'm just wearing it this once, she thought. This still isn't me.\nShe snapped on a sapphire bracelet. Like her barrettes, it contained no\nmetal; the gemstones were set into a thick hardwood that closed with a\nwooden twist-clasp. The only metal on her body, then, would be her coins,\nher metal vial, and the single earring. Kept, by Kelsier's suggestion, as a bit\nof metal she could Push on in an emergency.\n\"Mistress,\" OreSeur said, pulling something out from under her bed"

A sheet of paper. \"This fell from the box as you were opening\nit.\" He grabbed it between two of his surprisingly dexterous paw fingers and\nheld it up for her.\nVin accepted the paper. Lady Heir, it read.\nI made the chest and bodice extra tight to give support—and cut the\nskirts so they would resist flaring—in case you need to jump.

Though the\nsleeves were tight around the upper arms, the forearms were looser, and she\ncould see where the daggers could be strapped.\n\"It seems that he has made dresses for Mistborn before,\" OreSeur\nnoted.\n\"Probably,\" Vin said.

He'd\nbeen the one to rightly point out the dangers of going into the camp.\nOreSeur simply lay down, resting head on paws as he watched her\ncontinue applying her makeup.\n\"But, El,\" Ham said, \"you should at least let us send you in our own\ncarriage.\"\nElend shook his head, straightening his jacket as he looked in the\nmirror. \"That would require sending in a coachman, Ham.\"\n\"Right,\" Ham said. \"Who would be me.\"\n\"One man won't make a difference in getting us out of that camp. And,\nthe fewer people I take with me, the fewer people Vin and I have to worry\nabout.\"\nHam shook his head. \"El, I. . .\"\nElend laid a hand on Ham's shoulder. \"I appreciate the concern, Ham.\nBut, I can do this. If there's one man in this world I can manipulate, it's my\nfather. I'll come out of this with him feeling assured that he has the city in\nhis pocket.\"\nHam sighed. \"All right.\"\n\"Oh, one other thing,\" Elend said hesitantly.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Would you mind calling me 'Elend' instead of just 'El'?\"\nHam chuckled. \"I suppose that one's easy enough to do.\"\nElend smiled thankfully. It's not what Tindwyl wanted, but it's a start.\nWe'll worry about the \"Your Majesty\"s later."

It's not what Tindwyl wanted, but it's a start.\nWe'll worry about the \"Your Majesty\"s later.\nThe door opened, and Dockson walked in. \"Elend,\" he said. \"This just\narrived for you.\" He held up a sheet of paper.\n\"From the Assembly?\" Elend asked.\nDockson nodded. \"They're not happy about you missing the meeting\nthis evening.\"\n\"Well, I can't change the appointment with Straff just because they\nwant to meet a day early,\" Elend said. \"Tell them I'll try and visit when I get\nback.\"\nDockson nodded, then turned as a rustling sounded from behind him.\nHe stepped to the side, a strange look on his face, as Vin walked up to the\ndoorway.\nAnd she was wearing a dress—a beautiful blue gown that was sleeker\nthan the common courtly fare. Her black hair sparkled with a pair of\nsapphire barrettes, and she seemed. . .different. More feminine—or, rather,\nmore confident in her femininity.\nHow much she's changed since I first met her, Elend thought, smiling.\nAlmost two years had passed. Then she had been a youth, albeit one with\nthe life experiences of someone far older. Now she was a woman—a very\ndangerous woman, but one who still looked up at him with eyes that were\njust a bit uncertain, just a bit insecure.\n\"Beautiful,\" Elend whispered. She smiled.\n\"Vin!\" Ham said, turning. \"You're wearing a dress!\"\nVin flushed. \"What did you expect, Ham? That I would meet with the\nking of the Northern Dominance in trousers?\"\n\"Well. . .\" Ham said. \"Actually, yes.\"\nElend chuckled. \"Just because you insist on going about everywhere in\ncasual clothing, Ham, doesn't mean that everyone does. Honestly, don't you\nget tired of those vests?\"\nHam shrugged. \"They're easy. And simple.\"\n\"And cold,\" Vin said, rubbing her arms. \"I'm glad I asked for\nsomething with sleeves.\"\n\"Be thankful for the weather,\" Ham said. \"Every chill you suffer will\nseem far worse to the men out in those armies.\"\nElend nodded. Winter had, technically, started. The weather probably\nwouldn't get bad enough to be more than a mild discomfort—they rarely got\nsnow in the Central Dominance—but the chill nights certainly wouldn't\nimprove morale.\n\"Well, let's go,\" Vin said. \"The sooner we get this over with, the\nbetter.\"\nElend stepped forward, smiling, taking Vin's hands. \"I appreciate this,\nVin,\" he said quietly. \"And you really do look gorgeous. If we weren't\nmarching off to near certain doom, I'd be tempted to command a ball be\nheld tonight just for the opportunity to show you off.\"\nVin smiled. \"Near certain doom is that compelling?\"\n\"Guess I've been spending too much time with the crew.\" He leaned\ndown to kiss her, but she yelped and jumped back.\n\"It took me the better part of an hour to get this makeup on right,\" she\nsnapped. \"No kissing!\"\nElend chuckled as Captain Demoux poked his head in the door. \"Your\nMajesty, the carriage has arrived.\""

She nodded.\n\"Let's go,\" he said.\nSitting inside the carriage Straff had sent for them, Elend could see a\nsolemn group standing on the wall, watching them roll away. The sun was\nnear to setting.\nHe commands us to come in the evening; we'll have to leave when the\nmists are out, Elend thought. A crafty way of pointing out how much power\nhe has over us.\nIt was his father's way—a move, in a way, that was similar to the\nattack on the walls a day before. To Straff, everything was about posturing.\nElend had watched his father at court, and had seen him manipulate even\nobligators. By holding the contract to oversee the Lord Ruler's atium mine,\nStraff Venture had played a game even more dangerous than his fellow\nnoblemen. And he had played that game very well. He hadn't factored in\nKelsier throwing chaos into the mix, but who had?\nSince the Collapse, Straff had secured the most stable, and most\npowerful, kingdom in the Final Empire. He was a crafty, careful man who\nknew how to plan for years to get what he wanted. And this was the man\nElend had to manipulate.\n\"You look worried,\" Vin said. She was across from him in the carriage,\nsitting in a prim, ladylike posture. It was as if donning a dress somehow\ngranted her new habits and mannerisms. Or just a return to old ones—she'd\nonce been able to act like a noblewoman well enough to fool Elend.\n\"We'll be all right,\" she said. \"Straff won't hurt you—even if things go\nbad, he won't dare make a martyr of you.\"\n\"Oh, I'm not worried about my safety,\" Elend said.\nVin raised an eyebrow. \"Because?\"\n\"Because I have you,\" Elend said with a smile. \"You're worth an army,\nVin.\"\nThis, however, didn't seem to console her.\n\"Come here,\" he said, scooting over and waving her to the seat beside\nhim.\nShe rose and moved across the carriage—but paused, eyeing him.\n\"Makeup.\"\n\"I'll be careful,\" Elend promised.\nShe nodded, sitting and letting him put an arm around her. \"Be careful\nof the hair, too,\" she said. \"And your suit coat—don't get anything on it.\"\n\"When did you get so fashion-conscious?\" he asked.\n\"It's the dress,\" Vin said with a sigh. \"As soon as I put it on, all of\nSazed's lessons started coming back to me.\"\n\"I really do like the dress on you,\" Elend said.\nVin shook her head.\n\"What?\" Elend asked as the carriage bumped, pushing her a bit closer\nto him. Another new perfume, he thought. At least that's one habit she never\ngot out of.\n\"This isn't me, Elend,\" she said quietly. \"This dress, these mannerisms.\nThey're a lie.\"\nElend sat quietly for a moment.\n\"No objections?\" Vin said. \"Everyone else thinks I'm speaking\nnonsense.\""

If wearing dresses\nfeels wrong to you, then you don't have to wear them. I want you to be\nhappy, Vin.\"\nVin smiled, looking up at him. Then she leaned up and kissed him.\n\"I thought you said none of that,\" he said.\n\"From you,\" she said. \"I'm Mistborn—we're more precise.\"\nElend smiled, though he couldn't quite feel jovial. Conversation,\nhowever, did keep him from fretting. \"I feel uncomfortable in these clothes,\nsometimes. Everyone expects so much more from me when I wear them.\nThey expect a king.\"\n\"When I wear a dress,\" Vin said, \"they expect a lady. Then they're\ndisappointed when they find me instead.\"\n\"Anyone who would feel disappointed to find you is too dense to be of\nany relevance,\" Elend said. \"I don't want you to be like them, Vin. They're\nnot honest. They don't care. I like you as you are.\"\n\"Tindwyl thinks that I can be both,\" Vin said. \"A woman and a\nMistborn.\"\n\"Tindwyl is wise,\" Elend said. \"A bit brutal, but wise. You should\nlisten to her.\"\n\"You just told me you liked me how I am.\"\n\"I do,\" Elend said. \"But I'd like you however you were, Vin. I love you.\nThe question is, how do you like yourself?\"\nThat gave her pause.\n\"Clothing doesn't really change a man,\" Elend said. \"But it changes\nhow others react to him. Tindwyl's words. I think. . .I think the trick is\nconvincing yourself that you deserve the reactions you get. You can wear\nthe court's dresses, Vin, but make them your own. Don't worry that you\naren't giving people what they want. Give them who you are, and let that be\nenough.\" He paused, smiling. \"It was for me.\"\nShe smiled back, then carefully leaned against him. \"All right,\" she\nsaid. \"Enough insecurity for the moment. Let's review. Tell me more about\nyour father's disposition.\"\n\"He's a perfect imperial nobleman. Ruthless, clever, and infatuated\nwith power. You remember my. . .experience when I was thirteen?\"\nVin nodded.\n\"Well, Father was very fond of skaa brothels. I think that he liked how\nstrong he felt by taking a girl while knowing that she would be killed for his\npassion. He keeps several dozen mistresses, and if they don't please him,\nthey get removed.\"\nVin muttered something quietly in response to this.\n\"He's the same way with political allies. One didn't ally with House\nVenture—one agreed to be dominated by House Venture. If you weren't\nwilling to be our slave, then you didn't get to contract with us.\"\nVin nodded. \"I've known crewleaders like that.\"\n\"And how did you survive when they turned an eye toward you?\"\n\"By acting unimportant,\" Vin said. \"By crawling on the ground when"

Let him think he's bullying you into doing what he wants—\nhe'll enjoy that.\"\n\"You've had experience with this before, I see.\"\n\"Too much of it,\" Vin said. \"But, you've heard this before.\"\nElend nodded. They'd planned and replanned this meeting. Now he\nsimply had to do what the crew had taught him. Make Straff think we're\nweak, imply we'll give him the city—but only if he helps us against Cett\nfirst.\nOutside the window, Elend could see that they were approaching\nStraff's army. So big! he thought. Where did Father learn to administrate a\nforce like this?\nElend had hoped, perhaps, that his father's lack of military experience\nwould translate to a poorly run army. Yet, the tents were arranged in a\ncareful pattern, and the soldiers wore neat uniforms. Vin moved over to her\nwindow, looking out with avid eyes, showing far more interest than an\nimperial noblewoman would have dared. \"Look,\" she said, pointing.\n\"What?\" Elend asked, leaning over.\n\"Obligator,\" Vin said.\nElend looked over her shoulder, spotting the former imperial priest—\nthe skin around his eyes tattooed in a wide pattern—directing a line of\nsoldiers outside a tent. \"So that's it. He's using obligators to administrate.\"\nVin shrugged. \"It makes sense. They'd know how to manage large\ngroups of people.\"\n\"And how to supply them,\" Elend said. \"Yes, it's a good idea—but it's\nstill surprising. It implies that he still needs obligators—and that he's still\nsubject to the Lord Ruler's authority. Most of the other kings threw off the\nobligators as soon as they could.\"\nVin frowned. \"I thought you said your father likes being in power.\"\n\"He does,\" Elend said. \"But also likes powerful tools. He always keeps\na kandra, and he has a history of associating with dangerous Allomancers.\nHe believes that he can control them—and he probably believes the same\nthing about the obligators.\"\nThe carriage slowed, then stopped beside a large tent. Straff Venture\nemerged a moment later.\nElend's father had always been a large man, firm of figure with a\ncommanding posture. The new beard only heightened the effect. He wore a\nsharp, well-cut suit, just like the suits he had tried to get Elend to wear as a\nboy. That was when Elend had begun wearing his clothing disheveled—the\nbuttons undone, the jackets too large. Anything to separate him from his\nfather.\nElend's defiance had never been meaningful, however. He had annoyed\nStraff, pulling small stunts and acting foolish when he knew he could get\naway with it. None of it had mattered."

None of it had mattered.\nNot until that final night. Luthadel in flames, the skaa rebellion running\nout of control, threatening to bring down the entire city. A night of chaos\nand destruction, with Vin trapped somewhere within it.\nThen Elend had stood up to Straff Venture.\nI'm not the same boy you pushed around, Father. Vin squeezed his\narm, and Elend climbed out of the carriage as the coachman opened the\ndoor. Straff waited quietly, a strange look on his face as Elend raised a hand\nto help Vin down.\n\"You came,\" Straff said.\n\"You seem surprised, Father.\"\nStraff shook his head. \"I see that you're just as big an idiot as ever, boy.\nYou're in my power now—I could have you killed with a bare wave of my\nhand.\" He raised his arm, as if to do just that.\nNow's the moment, Elend thought, heart thumping. \"I've always been\nin your power, Father,\" he said. \"You could have had me killed months ago,\ncould have taken my city away at a bare whim. I don't see how my coming\nhere changes anything.\"\nStraff hesitated.\n\"We came for dinner,\" Elend said. \"I had hoped to give you a chance to\nmeet Vin, and had hoped that we might discuss certain. . .issues of\nparticular import to you.\"\nStraff frowned.\nThat's right, Elend thought. Wonder if I have some offer yet to make.\nYou know that the first man to play his hand usually loses.\nStraff wouldn't pass up an opportunity for gain—even a slim\nopportunity, like the one Elend represented. He probably figured there was\nnothing Elend could say that was of real importance. But could he be sure?\nWhat did he have to lose?\n\"Go and confirm with my chef that there will be three for dinner,\"\nStraff said to a servant.\nElend let out a lightly held breath.\n\"That girl's your Mistborn, then?\" Straff asked.\nElend nodded.\n\"Cute little thing,\" Straff said. \"Tell her to stop Soothing my\nemotions.\"\nVin flushed.\nStraff nodded toward the tent. Elend led Vin forward, though she\nglanced over her shoulder, obviously not liking the idea of exposing her\nback to Straff.\nLittle bit late for that. . .Elend thought.\nThe tent chamber was what Elend would have expected of his father:\nstuffed with pillows and rich furniture, very little of which Straff would\nactually use. Straff furnished to suggest his power. Like the massive keeps\nof Luthadel, a nobleman's surroundings were an expression of how\nimportant he was.\nVin waited quietly, tensely, at Elend's side in the center of the room.\n\"He's good,\" she whispered. \"I was as subtle as I can manage, and he still\nnoticed my touch.\"\nElend nodded. \"He's also a Tineye,\" he said in a normal voice. \"So he's\nprobably listening to us right now.\"\nElend looked toward the door. Straff walked in a few moments later,"

Straff walked in a few moments later,\ngiving no indication as to whether he had heard Vin or not. A group of\nservants entered a few moments later, carrying a large dining table.\nVin inhaled sharply. The servants were skaa—imperial skaa, after the\nold tradition. They were ragged, their clothing made of torn smocks, and\nshowed bruises from a recent beating. They carried their loads with lowered\neyes.\n\"Why the reaction, girl?\" Straff asked. \"Oh, that's right. You're skaa,\naren't you—pretty dress notwithstanding? Elend is very kind; I wouldn't let\nyou wear something like that.\" Or much at all, his tone implied.\nVin shot Straff a look, but pulled a little closer to Elend, grabbing his\narm. Again, Straff's words were only about posturing; Straff was cruel, but\nonly insofar as it served him. He wanted to make Vin uncomfortable.\nWhich he seemed to be doing. Elend frowned, glancing down, and\ncaught just a hint of a sly smile on her lips.\nBreeze has told me that Vin is more subtle with her Allomancy than\nmost Soothers, he recalled. Father's good, but for him to pick out her touch.\n. .\nShe let him, of course.\nElend looked back at Straff, who hit one of the skaa servants on their\nway out. \"I hope none of them are relatives of yours,\" Straff said to Vin.\n\"They haven't been very diligent lately. I might have to execute a few.\"\n\"I'm not skaa anymore,\" Vin said quietly. \"I'm a noblewoman.\"\nStraff just laughed. He had already dismissed Vin as a threat. He knew\nshe was Mistborn, he must have heard that she was dangerous, and yet he\nnow assumed that she was weak and inconsequential.\nShe is good at this, Elend thought with wonder. Servants began to\nbring in a feast that was impressive considering the circumstances. As they\nwaited, Straff turned to an aide. \"Send in Hoselle,\" he ordered. \"And tell her\nto be quick.\"\nHe seems less reserved than I remember, Elend thought. In the Lord\nEmperor's day, a good nobleman had been stiff and inhibited when in\npublic, though many had turned to extravagant indulgence when in private.\nThey would dance and have quiet dinner conversation at the ball, for\ninstance, but enjoy whores and drunkenness in the small hours of night.\n\"Why the beard, Father?\" Elend asked. \"Last I knew, those weren't in\nfashion.\"\n\"I set the fashion now, boy,\" Straff said. \"Sit.\" Vin waited respectfully,\nElend noticed, until Elend was seated before taking her place. She managed\nto maintain an air of half jumpiness: she'd look Straff in the eyes, but\nalways gave a reflexive twitch, as if part of her wanted to glance away.\n\"Now,\" Straff said, \"tell me why you're here.\"\n\"I thought it was obvious, Father,\" Elend said. \"I'm here to discuss our\nalliance.\"\nStraff raised an eyebrow. \"Alliance?

I\nassume that you weren't expecting Cett's arrival?\"\n\"Cett is of little concern,\" Straff said, turning his attention to the meal:\nbig slabs of barely cooked beef. Vin wrinkled her nose, though Elend\ncouldn't tell if that was part of her act or not.\nElend cut his steak. \"A man with an army nearly as large as your own\nis hardly of 'little' concern, Father.\"\nStraff shrugged. \"He'll be of no trouble to me once I have the city\nwalls. You'll turn those over to me as part of our alliance, I assume?\"\n\"And invite Cett to attack the city?\" Elend said. \"Yes, together you and\nI could hold against him, but why go on the defensive? Why let him weaken\nour fortifications, and possibly just continue this siege until both of our\narmies are starving? We need to attack him, Father.\"\nStraff snorted. \"You think I need your help to do so?\"\n\"You do if you want to beat him with any measure of assured success,\"\nElend said. \"We can take him easily together—but never alone. We need\neach other. Let's attack, you leading your armies, me leading mine.\"\n\"Why are you so eager?\" Straff asked, narrowing his eyes.\n\"Because I want to prove something,\" Elend said. \"Look, we both\nknow you're going to take Luthadel from me. But, if we ride together\nagainst Cett first, it will look like I wanted to ally with you all along. I'll be\nable to give you the city without looking like a complete buffoon. I can spin\nit that I brought in my father to help us against the army I knew was\ncoming. I turn the city over to you, and then become your heir again. We\nboth get what we want. But only once Cett is dead.\"\nStraff paused, and Elend could see that his words were having an\neffect. Yes, he thought. Think that I'm just the same boy you left behind—\neccentric, eager to resist you for silly reasons. And, saving face is a very\nVenture thing to do.\n\"No,\" Straff said.\nElend started.\n\"No,\" Straff said again, turning to his meal. \"That's not how we're\ngoing to do this, boy. I'll decide when—or even if—I attack Cett.\"\nThat should have worked! Elend thought. He studied Straff, trying to\njudge what was wrong. There was a faint hesitance about his father.\nI need more information, he thought. He glanced to his side, to where\nVin sat, spinning something lightly in her hand. Her fork. She met his eyes,\nthen tapped it lightly.\nMetal, Elend thought. Good idea. He looked over at Straff. \"You came\nfor the atium,\" he said. \"You don't have to conquer my city to get it.\"\nStraff leaned forward. \"Why haven't you spent it?\"\n\"Nothing brings sharks faster than fresh blood, Father,\" Elend said."

She wore a ball gown—red—and had her black hair\npulled back into a long, flowing tail. She was, perhaps, fifteen.\n\"Hoselle,\" Straff said, pointing to the chair next to him.\nThe girl nodded obediently, scurrying forward to sit beside Straff. She\nwas done up in makeup, and the dress was low-cut. Elend had little doubt as\nto her relationship with Straff.\nStraff smiled and chewed his food, calm and gentlemanly. The girl\nlooked a little bit like Vin—same almond face, similar dark hair, same fine\nfeatures and thin build. It was a statement. I can get one just like yours—\nonly younger and prettier. More posturing.\nIt was that moment—that smirk in Straff's eyes—which reminded\nElend more than ever why he hated his father.\n\"Perhaps we can make a deal, boy,\" Straff said. \"Deliver the atium to\nme, and I'll deal with Cett.\"\n\"Getting it to you will take time,\" Elend said.\n\"Why?\" Straff asked. \"Atium is light.\"\n\"There's a lot of it.\"\n\"Not so much you couldn't pack it on a cart and send it out,\" Straff\nsaid.\n\"It's more complicated than that,\" Elend said.\n\"I don't think it is,\" Straff said, smiling. \"You just don't want to give it\nto me.\"\nElend frowned.\n\"We don't have it,\" Vin whispered.\nStraff turned.\n\"We never found it,\" she said. \"Kelsier overthrew the Lord Ruler just\nso he could get that atium. But we never could find out where the metal\nwas. It probably wasn't ever in the city.\"\nWasn't expecting that. . .Elend thought. Of course, Vin tended to do\nthings by instinct, much as Kelsier was said to have done. All the planning\nin the world could go out the window with Vin around—but what she did\ninstead was usually better.\nStraff sat for a moment. He seemed to believe Vin. \"So you really have\nnothing at all to offer me.\"\nI need to act weak, Elend remembered. Need him to think he can take\nthe city any time, but also think it isn't worth taking right now. He began to\ntap the table quietly with his index finger, trying to look nervous. If Straff\nthinks we don't have the atium. . .then he'll be a lot less likely to risk\nattacking the city. Less gain. That's why Vin said what she did.\n\"Vin doesn't know what she's talking about,\" Elend said. \"I've kept the\natium hidden, even from her. I'm sure we can arrange something, Father.\"\n\"No,\" Straff said, now sounding amused. \"You really don't have it.\nZane said. . .but, well, I didn't believe. . .\""

He looked\nat his child mistress. \"Leave us,\" he said.\nShe immediately did as commanded.\n\"You, too,\" Straff said to Vin.\nVin stiffened slightly. She looked toward Elend.\n\"It's all right,\" he said slowly.\nShe paused, then nodded. Straff himself was little danger to Elend, and\nshe was a Mistborn. If something went wrong, she could get to Elend\nquickly. And, if she left, it would do what they wanted—make Elend look\nless powerful.

You'd still have to take Luthadel by force, and Cett\nwould still be able to attack—and defeat you—in your weakened state.\"\nStraff smiled, folding his arms, leaning forward so he loomed over the\ntable. \"You are wrong on both counts, boy. First, I think that if I killed you,\nthe next leader of Luthadel would be more accommodating. I have certain\ninterests in the city who indicate that is true. Second, I don't need your help\nto fight Cett. He and I already have a treaty.\"\nElend paused. \"What?\"\n\"What do you think I've been doing these last few weeks? Sitting and\nwaiting on your whims? Cett and I have exchanged pleasantries. He's not\ninterested in the city—he just wants the atium. We agreed to split what we\ndiscover in Luthadel, then work together to take the rest of the Final\nEmpire. He conquers to the west and north, I head east and south. Very\naccommodating man, Cett.\"\nHe's bluffing, Elend thought with reasonable certainty. That wasn't\nStraff's way; he wouldn't make an alliance with someone so near to him in\nstrength. Straff feared betrayal too much.\n\"You think I would believe that?\" Elend said.\n\"Believe what you wish,\" Straff said.\n\"And the koloss army marching this way?\" Elend asked, playing one\nof their trump cards.\nThis made Straff pause.\n\"If you want to take Luthadel before those koloss get here, Father,\"\nElend said, \"then I think you might want to be a little more accommodating\ntoward the man who's come, offering you everything you want. I only ask\none thing—let me have a victory. Let me fight Cett, secure my legacy. Then\nyou can have the city.\""

I'll take my chances with Cett. I don't know why he is willing to\nlet me have Luthadel, but he doesn't seem to care much about it.\"\n\"And you do?\" Elend said. \"You know we don't have the atium. What\ndoes the city matter to you now?\"\nStraff leaned forward a bit farther. Elend could smell his breath,\nodorous from the dinner spices. \"That's where you are wrong about me,\nboy. That's why—even if you'd been able to promise me that atium—you\nwould never have left this camp tonight. I made a mistake a year ago. If I'd\nstayed in Luthadel, I would have been the one on that throne. Instead, it was\nyou. I can't imagine why—I guess a weak Venture was still better than the\nother alternatives.\"\nStraff was everything Elend had hated about the old empire.\nPresumptuous. Cruel. Arrogant.\nWeakness, Elend thought, calming himself. I can't be threatening. He\nshrugged. \"It's only a city, Father. From my position, it doesn't matter half\nas much as your army.\"\n\"It's more than a city,\" Straff said. \"It's the Lord Ruler's city—and it\nhas my home in it. My keep. I understand that you're using it as your\npalace.\"\n\"I didn't really have any other place to go.\"\nStraff turned back to his meal. \"All right,\" he said in between cutting\nchunks of steak, \"at first, I thought you were an idiot for coming tonight,\nbut now I'm not so certain. You must have seen the inevitable.\"\n\"You're stronger,\" Elend said. \"I can't stand up to you.\"\nStraff nodded. \"You've impressed me, boy. Wearing proper clothing,\ngetting yourself a Mistborn mistress, maintaining control of the city. I'm\ngoing to let you live.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Elend said.\n\"And, in exchange, you're going to give me Luthadel.\"\n\"As soon as Cett is dealt with.\"\nStraff laughed. \"No, that's not the way these things work, boy. We're\nnot negotiating. You're listening to my orders. Tomorrow, we'll ride to the\ncity together, and you'll order the gates opened. I'll march my army in and\ntake command, and Luthadel will become the new capital of my kingdom.\nIf you stay in line and do as I say, I'll name you heir again.\"\n\"We can't do that,\" Elend said. \"I left orders that the gates weren't to be\nopened to you, no matter what.\"\nStraff paused.\n\"My advisors thought you might try and use Vin as a hostage, forcing\nme to relinquish the city,\" Elend said. \"If we go together, they'll assume\nyou're threatening me.\"\nStraff's mood darkened. \"You'd better hope that they don't.\""

They'd be eager\nfor an excuse to take the city away from me.\"\n\"Then, why come here?\"\n\"To do as I said,\" Elend said. \"To negotiate an alliance against Cett. I\ncan deliver Luthadel to you—but I still need time. Let's take down Cett\nfirst.\"\nStraff grabbed his dinner knife by the hilt and slammed it down into\nthe table. \"I said this wasn't a negotiation! You don't make demands, boy. I\ncould have you killed!\"\n\"I'm just stating facts, Father,\" Elend said quickly. \"I don't want to—\"\n\"You've gotten smooth,\" Straff said, eyes narrowing. \"What did you\nhope to accomplish with this game? Coming to my camp? Bringing nothing\nto offer. . .\" He paused, then continued. \"Nothing to offer except for that\ngirl. Pretty little thing, she is.\"\nElend flushed. \"That won't get you into the city. Remember, my\nadvisors thought you might try threatening her.\"\n\"Fine,\" Straff snapped. \"You die; I take the city by force.\"\n\"And Cett attacks you from behind,\" Elend said. \"Pinning you against\nour wall and forcing you to fight surrounded.\"\n\"He'd take heavy losses,\" Straff said. \"He wouldn't be able to take and\nhold the city after that.\"\n\"Even with diminished forces, he'd have a better chance of taking it\nfrom us than he would if he waited and then tried to take it from you.\"\nStraff stood. \"I'll have to take that chance. I left you behind before. I'm\nnot going to let you loose again, boy. Those cursed skaa were supposed to\nkill you and leave me free of you.\"\nElend stood as well. However, he could see the resolve in Straff's eyes.\nIt isn't working, Elend thought, panic beginning to set in. This plan had\nbeen a gamble, but he hadn't ever really thought that he'd fail. Indeed, he'd\nplayed his cards well. But, something was wrong—something he hadn't\nanticipated, and still didn't understand. Why was Straff resisting so much?\nI'm too new to this, Elend thought. Ironically, if he had let his father\ntrain him better as a child, he might have known what he'd done wrong. As\nit was, he suddenly realized the gravity of his situation. Surrounded by a\nhostile army. Separated from Vin.\nHe was going to die.\n\"Wait!\" Elend said desperately.\n\"Ah,\" Straff said smiling. \"Finally realized what you've gotten yourself\ninto?\" There was pleasure in Straff's smile. Eagerness. There had always\nbeen something inside Straff that had enjoyed hurting others, though Elend\nhad rarely seen it applied to him. Propriety had always been there to stop\nStraff.\nPropriety enforced by the Lord Ruler. At that moment, Elend saw\nmurder in his father's eyes.\n\"You never intended to let me live,\" Elend said. \"Even if I'd given you"

I do thank you for bringing me that girl, though. I'll take her\ntonight. We'll see if she cries my name or yours while I'm—\"\nElend laughed.\nIt was a desperate laugh, a laugh at the ridiculous situation he'd gotten\nhimself into, a laugh at his sudden worry and fear—but most of all, it was a\nlaugh at the idea of Straff trying to force himself upon Vin. \"You have no\nidea how foolish you sound,\" Elend said.\nStraff flushed. \"For that, boy, I'll be extra rough with her.\"\n\"You are a pig, Father,\" Elend said. \"A sick, disgusting man. You\nthought you were a brilliant leader, but you were barely competent. You\nnearly got our house destroyed—only the Lord Ruler's own death saved\nyou!\"\nStraff called for his guards.\n\"You may take Luthadel,\" Elend said, \"but you'll lose it! I may have\nbeen a bad king, but you'll be a terrible one. The Lord Ruler was a tyrant,\nbut he was also a genius. You're neither. You're just a selfish man who'll use\nup his resources, then end up dead from a knife in the back.\"\nStraff pointed at Elend as soldiers rushed in. Elend didn't cringe. He'd\ngrown up with this man, been raised by him, been tortured by him. And,\ndespite it all, Elend had never spoken his mind. He'd rebelled with the petty\ntimidity of a teenage boy, but he'd never spoken the truth.\nIt felt good. It felt right.\nPerhaps playing the weak hand was a mistake against Straff. He\nalways was fond of crushing things.\nAnd suddenly Elend knew what he had to do. He smiled, looking\nStraff in the eyes.\n\"Kill me, Father,\" he said, \"and you'll die, too.\"\n\"Kill me, Father,\" Elend said, \"and you'll die, too.\"\nVin paused. She stood outside the tent, in the darkness of early night.\nShe'd been standing with Straff's soldiers, but they'd rushed in at his\ncommand. She'd moved into the darkness, and now stood on the north side\nof the tent, watching the shadowed forms move within.\nShe'd been about to burst in. Elend hadn't been doing very well—not\nthat he was a bad negotiator. He was just too honest by nature. It wasn't\ndifficult to tell when he was bluffing, especially if you knew him well.\nBut, this new proclamation was different. It wasn't a sign of Elend\nattempting to be clever, nor was it an angry outburst like the one he'd made\nmoments before. Suddenly, he seemed calm and forceful.\nVin waited quietly, her daggers out, tense in the mists before the\nglowing tent. Something told her she had to give Elend just a few more\nmoments.\nStraff laughed at Elend's threat."

You think I would willingly deal with one such as you? No. You\nknow me better than that. You know that I'd never submit to you.\"\n\"Then why?\" Straff asked.\nShe could almost hear Elend's smile. \"I came to get near you, Father. .\n.and to bring my Mistborn to the very heart of your camp.\"\nSilence.\nFinally, Straff laughed. \"You threaten me with that wisp of a girl? If\nthat's the great Mistborn of Luthadel I've been hearing of, then I'm sorely\ndisappointed.\"\n\"That's because she wants you to feel that way,\" Elend said. \"Think,\nFather. You were suspicious, and the girl confirmed those suspicions. But, if\nshe's as good as the rumors say—and I know you've heard the rumors—\nthen how would you have spotted her touch on your emotions?\n\"You caught her Soothing you, and you called her on it. Then, you\ndidn't feel the touch anymore, so you assumed that she was cowed. But,\nafter that, you began to feel confident. Comfortable. You dismissed Vin as a\nthreat—but would any rational man dismiss a Mistborn, no matter how\nsmall or quiet? In fact, you'd think that the small, quiet ones would be the\nassassins you'd want to pay the most attention to.\"\nVin smiled. Clever, she thought. She reached out, Rioting Straff's\nemotions, flaring her metal and stoking his sense of anger. He gasped in\nsudden shock. Take the clue, Elend.\n\"Fear,\" Elend said.\nShe Soothed away Straff's anger and exchanged it for fear.\n\"Passion.\"\nShe complied.\n\"Calmness.\"\nShe soothed everything away. Inside the tent, she saw Straff's shadow\nstanding stiffly. An Allomancer couldn't force a person to do anything—and\nusually, strong Pushes or Pulls on an emotion were less effective, since they\nalerted the target that something was wrong. In this case, however, Vin\nwanted Straff to know for certain she was watching.\nShe smiled, extinguishing her tin. Then she burned duralumin and\nSoothed Straff's emotions with explosive pressure, wiping away all capacity\nfor feeling within him. His shadow stumbled beneath the attack.\nHer brass was gone a moment later, and she turned on her tin again,\nwatching the black patterns on the canvas.\n\"She's powerful, Father,\" Elend said. \"She's more powerful than any\nAllomancer you've known. She killed the Lord Ruler. She was trained by\nthe Survivor of Hathsin. And if you kill me, she'll kill you.\"\nStraff righted himself, and the tent fell silent again.\nA footstep sounded.

He didn't, however, order his soldiers\nforward any farther.\n\"Kill me, and you die, too,\" Elend said. \"And not just you. Your\ngenerals. Your captains. Even your obligators. She has orders to slaughter\nyou all.\"\nZane took a step closer to Vin, his feet crunching slightly on the\npacked-down weeds that made up the floor of the camp. \"Ah,\" he\nwhispered, \"clever. No matter how strong your opponent is, he can't attack\nif you've got a knife at his throat.\"\nZane leaned even closer, and Vin looked up at him, their faces just\ninches from each other. He shook his head in the soft mists. \"But tell me—\nwhy is it that people like you and me always have to be the knives?\"\nInside the tent, Straff was growing concerned. \"No one is that\npowerful, boy,\" he said, \"not even a Mistborn. She might be able to kill\nsome of my generals, but she'd never get to me. I have my own Mistborn.\"\n\"Oh?\" Elend said. \"And why hasn't he killed her? Because he's afraid\nto attack? If you kill me, Father—if you even make so much as a move\ntoward my city—then she'll begin the slaughter. Men will die like prisoners\nbefore the fountains on a day of execution.\"\n\"I thought you said he was above this kind of thing,\" Zane whispered.\n\"You claimed you weren't his tool.

Elend hadn't actually ever seen her attack other\nAllomancers. \"He saw me attack some soldiers once, and I've told him\nabout my fights with other Allomancers.\"\n\"Ah,\" Zane said softly. \"So it's only a small lie, then.

Vin turned slightly, watching carefully as he walked into\nthe mists, away from tents, torches, and soldiers. He paused, standing a\nshort distance away, looking up. Even with the light of tent and fires, this\ncamp was claimed by the mists. It spun all around them. From within it, the\ntorchlight and campfires seemed insignificant. Like dying coals.\n\"What is this to him,\" Zane said quietly, sweeping a hand around him.\n\"Can he ever understand the mists? Can he ever understand you?\"\n\"He loves me,\" Vin said, glancing back at the shadowed forms. They\nhad fallen quiet for a moment, Straff obviously considering Elend's threats.\n\"He loves you?\" Zane asked. \"Or he loves having you?\"\n\"Elend isn't like that,\" Vin said. \"He's a good man.\"\n\"Good or not, you aren't like him,\" Zane said, voice echoing in the\nnight to her tin-enhanced ears. \"Can he understand what it is like to be one\nof us? Can he know the things we know, care about the things we love? Has\nhe ever seen those?\" Zane gestured upward, toward the sky. Far beyond the\nmists, lights shone in the sky, like tiny freckles. Stars, invisible to the\nnormal eye. Only a person burning tin could penetrate the mists and see\nthem shining.\nShe remembered the first time Kelsier had shown them to her. She\nremembered how stunned she had been that the stars had been there all\nalong, invisible beyond the mists. . ..\nZane continued to point upward. \"Lord Ruler!\" Vin whispered, taking\na small step away from the tent. Through the swirling mists, in the reflected\nlight of the tent, she could see something on Zane's arm.\nThe skin was covered with thin white streaks. Scars.\nZane immediately lowered his arm, hiding the scarred flesh with his\nsleeve.\n\"You were in the Pits of Hathsin,\" Vin said quietly. \"Like Kelsier.\"\nZane looked away.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Vin said.\nZane turned back, smiling in the night. It was a firm, confident smile.\nHe stepped forward. \"I understand you, Vin.\"\nThen he bowed slightly to her and jumped away, disappearing into the\nmists. Inside the room, Straff spoke to Elend.\n\"Go. Leave here.\"\nThe carriage rolled away. Straff stood outside his tent, heedless of the\nmists, still feeling a bit stunned.\nI let him go. Why did I let him go?\nYet—even now—he could feel her touch slamming against him. One\nemotion after another, like a treasonous maelstrom within him, and then. .\n.nothing. Like a massive hand, grabbing his soul and squeezing it into\npainful submission. It had felt the way he thought death might.\nNo Allomancer could be that powerful.\nZane respects her, Straff thought. And everyone says she killed the\nLord Ruler. That little thing.

The\nfrightening thing about it was that Straff might have gone along with it,\nassuming Elend to be of no consequence, if the spy hadn't sent warning.\nEven so, Elend had bested him. Straff had even been prepared for their\nfeint of weakness, and he had still fallen.\nShe's so powerful. . ..\nA figure in black stepped out of the mists and walked up to Straff.\n\"You look like you've seen a ghost, Father,\" Zane said with a smile. \"Your\nown, perhaps?\"\n\"Was there anyone else out there, Zane?\" Straff asked, too shaken for\nrepartee at the moment. \"Another couple of Mistborn, perhaps, helping\nher?\"\nZane shook his head. \"No. She really is that strong.\" He turned to walk\nback out into the mists.\n\"Zane!\" Straff snapped, making the man pause. \"We're going to change\nplans. I want you to kill her.\"\nZane turned. \"But—\"\n\"She's too dangerous. Plus, we now have the information we wanted to\nget from her. They don't have the atium.\"\n\"You believe them?\" Zane asked.\nStraff paused. After how thoroughly he'd been manipulated this\nevening, he wasn't going to trust anything he thought he'd learned. \"No,\" he\ndecided. \"But we'll find it another way. I want that girl dead, Zane.\"\n\"Are we attacking the city for real, then?\"\nStraff almost gave the order right then, commanding his armies to\nprepare for a morning assault. The preliminary attack had gone well,\nshowing that the defenses were hardly impressive. Straff could take that\nwall, then use it against Cett.\nHowever, Elend's final words before departing this evening made him\nstop. Send your armies against my city, Father, the boy had said, and die.\nYou've felt her power—you know what she can do. You can try and hide, you\ncan even conquer my city.\nBut she will find you. And she will kill you.\nYour only option is to wait. I'll contact you when my armies are\nprepared to attack Cett. We'll strike together, as I said earlier.\nStraff couldn't depend on that. The boy had changed—had become\nstrong, somehow. If Straff and Elend attacked together, Straff had no\nillusions as to how quickly he'd be betrayed. But Straff couldn't attack\nLuthadel while that girl was alive. Not knowing her strength, having felt her\ntouch on his emotions.\n\"No,\" he finally said to Zane's question. \"We won't attack. Not until\nyou kill her.\"\n\"That might be harder than you make it sound, Father,\" Zane said. \"I'll\nneed some help.\"\n\"What kind of help?\"\n\"A strike team.

Most Allomancers were easy\nto identify because of their noble lineages. Straff, however, had access to\nsome special resources. There was a reason that he had so many mistresses\n—dozens and dozens of them. Some thought it was just because he was\nlustful.\nThat wasn't it at all. More mistresses meant more children. And more\nchildren, born from a high noble line like his, meant more Allomancers.\nHe'd only spawned one Mistborn, but there were many Mistings.\n\"It will be done,\" Straff said.\n\"They might not survive the encounter, Father,\" Zane warned, still\nstanding in the mists.\nThat awful sensation returned. The sense of nothingness, the horrible\nknowledge that someone else had complete and total control over his\nemotions. Nobody should have that much power over him. Especially not\nElend.\nHe should be dead. He came right to me. And I let him go.\n\"Get rid of her,\" Straff said. \"Do anything you need to, Zane.\nAnything.\"\nZane nodded, then walked away with a self-satisfied stroll.\nStraff returned to his tent and sent for Hoselle again. She looked\nenough like Elend's girl. It would do him good to remind himself that most\nof the time, he really was in control.\nElend sat back in the carriage, a little stunned. I'm still alive! he\nthought with growing excitement. I did it! I convinced Straff to leave the\ncity alone.\nFor a time, at least. Luthadel's safety depended on Straff remaining\nfrightened of Vin. But. . .well, any victory was an enormous one for Elend.\nHe hadn't failed his people. He was their king, and his plan—crazy though\nit might have seemed—had worked. The small crown on his head suddenly\ndidn't seem as heavy as it had before.\nVin sat across from him. She didn't look nearly as pleased as she could\nhave.\n\"We did it, Vin!\" Elend said. \"It wasn't what we planned, but it\nworked. Straff won't dare attack the city now.\"\nShe nodded quietly.\nElend frowned. \"Um, it's because of you that the city will be safe. You\nknow that, right? If you hadn't been there. . .well, of course, if it hadn't been\nfor you, the entire Final Empire would still be enslaved.\"\n\"Because I killed the Lord Ruler,\" she said quietly.\nElend nodded.\n\"But it was Kelsier's plan—the crew's skills, the people's strength of\nwill—that freed the empire. I just held the knife.\"\n\"You make it sound like a trivial thing, Vin,\" he said. \"It's not! You're a\nfantastic Allomancer. Ham says he can't beat you even in an unfair fight\nanymore, and you've kept the palace free of assassins. There's nobody like\nyou in all of the Final Empire!\"\nStrangely, his words made her huddle into the corner just a little\nfarther.

Straff\nexpected me to come begging, and he was ready to control that situation.\nHowever, when I mentioned what would happen to him and his army if\nVin's anger was roused. . .\"\n\"My dear man,\" Breeze said. \"You went into the camp of the strongest\nking in the Final Empire, and you threatened him?\"\n\"Yes I did!\"\n\"Brilliant!\"\n\"I know!\" Elend said. \"I told my Father that he was going to let me\nleave his camp and that he was going to leave Luthadel alone, otherwise I'd\nhave Vin kill him and every general in his army.\" He put his arm around\nVin. She smiled at the group, but he could tell that something was still\ntroubling her.\nShe doesn't think I did a good job, Elend realized. She saw a better\nway to manipulate Straff, but she doesn't want to spoil my enthusiasm.\n\"Well, guess we won't need a new king,\" Spook said with a smile. \"I\nwas kind of looking forward to taking the job. . ..\"\nElend laughed. \"I don't intend to vacate the position for quite some\ntime yet. We'll let the people know that Straff has been cowed, if\ntemporarily. That should boost morale a bit. Then, we deal with the\nAssembly. Hopefully, they'll pass a resolution to wait for me to meet with\nCett like I just did with Straff.\""

Ham and Dockson joined\nhim and Vin, while the others took the carriage they'd come in. Elend\nglanced oddly at Dockson as he climbed into the carriage. Ordinarily, the\nman would have chosen the other vehicle—the one Elend wasn't in.\n\"Honestly, Elend,\" Ham said as he settled into his seat. \"I'm impressed.\nI half thought we were going to have to raid that camp to get you back.\"\nElend smiled, eyeing Dockson, who sat down as the carriage began\nmoving. He pulled open his satchel and took out a sealed envelope. He\nlooked up and met Elend's eyes. \"This came from the Assembly members\nfor you a short time ago, Your Majesty.\"\nElend paused. Then he took it and broke the seal. \"What is it?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" Dockson said. \"But. . .I've already started hearing\nrumors.\"\nVin leaned in, reading over Elend's arm as he scanned the sheet inside.\nYour Majesty, it read.\nThis note is to inform you that by majority vote, the Assembly has\ndecided to invoke the charter's no-confidence clause. We appreciate your\nefforts on behalf of the city, but the current situation calls for a different\nkind of leadership than Your Majesty can provide. We take this step with no\nhostility, but only resignation. We see no other alternative, and must act for\nthe good of Luthadel.\nWe regret to have to inform you of this by letter.\nIt was signed by all twenty-three members of the Assembly.\nElend lowered the paper, shocked.\n\"What?\" Ham asked.\n\"I've just been deposed,\" Elend said quietly.\nPART THREE\nKING\nHe left ruin in his wake, but it was forgotten. He created kingdoms,\nand then destroyed them as he made the world anew.\n28\n\"LET ME SEE IF I understand this correctly,\" Tindwyl said, calm and\npolite, yet somehow still stern and disapproving. \"There is a clause in the\nkingdom's legal code that lets the Assembly overthrow their king?\"\nElend wilted slightly. \"Yes.\"\n\"And you wrote the law yourself?\" Tindwyl demanded.\n\"Most of it,\" Elend admitted.\n\"You wrote into your own law a way that you could be deposed?\"\nTindwyl repeated. Their group—expanded from those who had met in the\ncarriages to include Clubs, Tindwyl, and Captain Demoux—sat in Elend's\nstudy. The group's size was such that they'd run out of chairs, and Vin sat\nquietly at the side, on a stack of Elend's books, having quickly changed to\ntrousers and shirt. Tindwyl and Elend were standing, but the rest were\nseated—Breeze prim, Ham relaxed, and Spook trying to balance his chair as\nhe leaned back on two legs."

Tindwyl and Elend were standing, but the rest were\nseated—Breeze prim, Ham relaxed, and Spook trying to balance his chair as\nhe leaned back on two legs.\n\"I put in that clause intentionally,\" Elend said. He stood at the front of\nthe room, leaning with one arm against the glass of his massive stained-\nglass window, looking up at its dark shards. \"This land wilted beneath the\nhand of an oppressive ruler for a thousand years. During that time,\nphilosophers and thinkers dreamed of a government where a bad ruler could\nbe ousted without bloodshed. I took this throne through an unpredictable\nand unique series of events, and I didn't think it right to unilaterally impose\nmy will—or the will of my descendants—upon the people. I wanted to start\na government whose monarchs would be responsible to their subjects.\"\nSometimes, he talks like those books he reads, Vin thought. Not like a\nnormal man at all. . .but like words on a page.\nZane's words came back to her, seeming to whisper in her mind. You\naren't like him. She pushed the thought out.\n\"With respect, Your Majesty,\" Tindwyl said, \"this has to be one of the\nmost foolish things I've ever seen a leader do.\"\n\"It was for the good of the kingdom,\" Elend said.\n\"It was sheer idiocy,\" Tindwyl snapped. \"A king doesn't subject\nhimself to the whims of another ruling body. He is valuable to his people\nbecause he is an absolute authority!\"\nVin had rarely seen Elend so sorrowful, and she cringed a bit at the\nsadness in his eyes. However, a different piece of her was rebelliously\nhappy. He wasn't king anymore. Now maybe people wouldn't work so hard\nto kill him. Maybe he could just be Elend again, and they could leave. Go\nsomewhere. A place where things weren't so complicated.\n\"Regardless,\" Dockson said to the quiet room, \"something must be\ndone. Discussing the prudence of decisions already past has little current\nrelevance.\"\n\"Agreed,\" Ham said. \"So, the Assembly tried to kick you out. What are\nwe going to do about it?\"\n\"We obviously can't let them have their way,\" Breeze said. \"Why, the\npeople overthrew a government just last year! This is a bad habit to be\ngetting into, I should think.\"\n\"We need to prepare a response, Your Majesty,\" Dockson said.\n\"Something decrying this deceitful maneuver, performed while you were\nnegotiating for the very safety of the city. Now that I look back, it's obvious\nthat they arranged this meeting so that you couldn't be present and defend\nyourself.\"\nElend nodded, still staring up at the dark glass. \"There's probably no\nneed to call me Your Majesty anymore, Dox.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" Tindwyl said, arms folded as she stood beside a bookcase.\n\"You are still king.\"\n\"I've lost the mandate of the people,\" Elend said.\n\"Yes,\" Clubs said, \"but you've still got the mandate of my armies. That\nmakes you king no matter what the Assembly says.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Tindwyl said. \"Foolish laws aside, you're still in a position"

Once we secure\nthe city, you can call in the Assembly and explain to its members that you\nneed their support.

I will not be belittled because I express my opinion!\"\nTindwyl paused, mouth partially open. Then she pressed her lips\ntogether and took her seat. Vin felt a quiet surge of satisfaction. You trained\nhim, Tindwyl, she thought with a smile. Can you really complain if he\nstands up to you?\nElend walked forward, placing his hands on the table as he regarded\nthe group. \"Yes, we will respond. Dox, you write a letter informing the\nAssembly of our disappointment and feelings of betrayal—inform them of\nour success with Straff, and lay on the guilt as thickly as possible.\n\"The rest of us will begin planning. We'll get the throne back. As has\nbeen stated, I know the law. I wrote it. There are ways to deal with this.\nThose ways do not, however, include sending our armies to secure the city.\nI will not be like the tyrants who would take Luthadel from us! I will not\nforce the people to do my will, even if I know it is best for them.\"\n\"Your Majesty,\" Tindwyl said carefully, \"there is nothing immoral\nabout securing your power during a time of chaos. People react irrationally\nduring such times. That is one of the reasons why they need strong\nleadership. They need you.\"\n\"Only if they want me, Tindwyl,\" Elend said."

However, she couldn't help\nsmiling. Part of what she loved about Elend was his sincerity. His simple\nlove for the people of Luthadel—his determination to do what was right for\nthem—was what separated him from Kelsier. Even in martyrdom, Kelsier\nhad displayed a hint of arrogance. He'd made certain that he would be\nremembered like few men who had ever lived.\nBut Elend—to him, ruling the Central Dominance wasn't about fame\nor glory. For the first time, completely and honestly, she decided something.\nElend was a far better king than Kelsier would ever have been.\n\"I'm. . .not certain what I think of this experience, Mistress,\" a voice\nwhispered beside her. Vin paused, looking down as she realized that she had\nbegun idly scratching OreSeur's ears.\nShe pulled her hand back with a start. \"Sorry,\" she said.\nOreSeur shrugged, resting his head back on his paws.\n\"So, you said there's a legal way to get the throne back,\" Ham said.\n\"How do we go about it?\"\n\"The Assembly has one month to choose a new king,\" Elend said.\n\"Nothing in the law says that the new king can't be the same as the old one.\nAnd, if they can't come up with a majority decision by that deadline, the\nthrone reverts to me for a minimum of one year.\"\n\"Complicated,\" Ham said, rubbing his chin.\n\"What did you expect?\" Breeze said. \"It's the law.\"\n\"I didn't mean the law itself,\" Ham said. \"I meant getting the Assembly\nto either choose Elend or not choose anyone. They wouldn't have deposed\nhim in the first place unless they had another person in mind for the throne.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" Dockson said. \"Perhaps they simply meant this as a\nwarning.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Elend said. \"Gentlemen, I think this is a sign.

She needed time to think, and the mists were still\nfresh.\nThis would be a lot easier if I weren't so skilled, Elend thought with\namusement, poking through his books. I set up the law too well.\nHe followed a particular passage with his finger, rereading it as the\ncrew slowly trailed away. He couldn't remember if he'd dismissed them or\nnot. Tindwyl would probably chastise him for that.\nHere, he thought, tapping the page. I might have grounds to argue for\na revote if any of the members of the Assembly arrived late to the meeting,\nor made their votes in absentia. The vote to depose had to be unanimous—\nsave, of course, for the king being deposed.\nHe paused, noticing movement. Tindwyl was the only one still in the\nroom with him. He looked up from his books with resignation. I probably\nhave this coming. . ..\n\"I apologize for treating you with disrespect, Your Majesty,\" she said.\nElend frowned. Wasn't expecting that.\n\"I have a habit of treating people like children,\" Tindwyl said. \"It is not\nsomething that I should be proud of, I think.\"\n\"It's—\" Elend paused. Tindwyl had taught him never to excuse\npeople's failings. He could accept people with failings—even forgive them\n—but if he glossed over the problems, then they would never change. \"I\naccept your apology,\" he said.\n\"You've learned quickly, Your Majesty.\"\n\"I haven't had much choice,\" Elend said with a smile. \"Of course, I\ndidn't change fast enough for the Assembly.\"\n\"How did you let this happen?\" she asked quietly. \"Even considering\nour disagreement over how a government should be run, I should think that\nthese Assemblymen would be supporters of yours.

Powerful men, friends or not, never like\nbeing ignored.\"\nShe nodded. \"Though, perhaps we should pause to take note of your\nsuccesses, rather than simply focusing on your failings. Vin tells me that\nyour meeting with your father went well.\"\nElend smiled. \"We scared him into submission. It felt very good to do\nsomething like that to Straff.

Keep Hasting's towers were dark\nshadows in the mists to her right and to her left. \"I sleep,\" she said.\n\"Occasionally.\" OreSeur yawned a deep, tongue-stretching yawn. Was\nhe adopting more canine mannerisms?\nVin turned away from the kandra, looking east, over the slumbering\ncity of Luthadel. There was a fire in the distance, a growing light that was\ntoo large to be of man's touch. Dawn had arrived. Another night had passed,\nmaking it nearly a week since she and Elend had visited Straff's army. Zane\nhad yet to appear.\n\"You're burning pewter, aren't you?\" OreSeur asked. \"To stay awake?\"\nVin nodded. Beneath a light burn of pewter, her fatigue was only a\nmild annoyance. She could feel it deep within her, if she looked hard, but it\nhad no power over her. Her senses were keen, her body strong. Even the\nnight's cold wasn't as bothersome. The moment she extinguished her\npewter, however, she'd feel the exhaustion in force.\n\"That cannot be healthy, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"You sleep barely\nthree or four hours a day. Nobody—Mistborn, man, or kandra—can survive\non a schedule like that for long.\"\nVin looked down. How could she explain her strange insomnia? She\nshould be over that; she no longer had to be frightened of the other\ncrewmembers around her. And yet, no matter how exhausted she grew, she\nwas finding sleep more and more difficult to claim. How could she sleep,\nwith that quiet thumping in the distance?\nIt seemed to be getting closer, for some reason. Or simply stronger? I\nhear the thumping sounds from above, the pulsings from the mountains. . ..\nWords from the logbook.\nHow could she sleep, knowing that the spirit watched her from the\nmist, ominous and hateful? How could she sleep when armies threatened to\nslaughter her friends, when Elend's kingdom had been taken from him,\nwhen everything she thought she'd known and loved was getting muddled\nand obscure?"

The\nmists persisted, however, reticent to give way before the sun.\n\"You shouldn't let that man influence you so, Mistress,\" OreSeur said.\n\"I do not think he is the person you believe him to be.\"\nVin frowned. \"He's my enemy. What else would I believe?\"\n\"You do not treat him like an enemy, Mistress.\"\n\"Well, he hasn't attacked Elend,\" Vin said. \"Maybe Zane isn't fully\nunder Straff's control.\"\nOreSeur sat quietly, head on paws. Then he turned away.\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\n\"Nothing, Mistress. I will believe as I'm told.\"\n\"Oh, no,\" Vin said, turning on the ledge to look at him. \"You're not\ngoing back to that excuse. What were you thinking?\"\nOreSeur sighed. \"I was thinking, Mistress, that your fixation with Zane\nis disconcerting.\"\n\"Fixation?\" Vin said. \"I'm just keeping an eye on him. I don't like\nhaving another Mistborn—enemy or not—running around in my city. Who\nknows what he could be up to?\"\nOreSeur frowned, but said nothing.\n\"OreSeur,\" Vin said, \"if you have things to say, speak!\"\n\"I apologize, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"I'm not accustomed to chatting\nwith my masters—especially not candidly.\"\n\"It's all right. Just speak your mind.\"\n\"Well, Mistress,\" OreSeur said, raising his head off his paws, \"I do not\nlike this Zane.\"\n\"What do you know of him?\"\n\"Nothing more than you,\" OreSeur admitted. \"However, most kandra\nare very good judges of character. When you practice imitation for as long\nas I have, you learn to see to the hearts of men. I do not like what I have\nseen of Zane. He seems too pleased with himself. He seems too deliberate\nin the way he has befriended you. He makes me uncomfortable.\"\nVin sat on the ledge, legs parted, hands before her with palms down,\nresting on the cool stone. He might be right.\nBut, OreSeur hadn't flown with Zane, hadn't sparred in the mists.\nThrough no fault of his own, OreSeur was like Elend. Not an Allomancer.\nNeither of them could understand what it was to soar on a Push of steel, to\nflare tin and experience the sudden shock of five heightened senses. They\ncouldn't know.

There was something she'd been meaning to mention, and now\nseemed as good a time as any. \"OreSeur, you can switch bodies, if you\nwant.\"\nThe wolfhound raised an eyebrow.\n\"We have those bones that we found in the palace,\" Vin said. \"You can\nuse those, if you're tired of being a dog.\"\n\"I couldn't use them,\" OreSeur said. \"I haven't digested their body—I\nwouldn't know the proper arrangement of muscles and organs to make the\nperson look correct.\"\n\"Well, then,\" Vin said. \"We could get you a criminal.\"\n\"I thought you liked these bones on me,\" OreSeur said.\n\"I do,\" Vin said. \"But, I don't want you to stay in a body that makes\nyou unhappy.\"\nOreSeur snorted. \"My happiness is not an issue.\"\n\"It is to me,\" Vin said. \"We could—\"\n\"Mistress,\" OreSeur interrupted.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"I shall keep these bones. I've grown accustomed to them. It is very\nfrustrating to change forms often.\"\nVin hesitated. \"All right,\" she finally said.\nOreSeur nodded. \"Though,\" he continued, \"speaking of bodies,\nMistress, are we ever planning to return to the palace? Not all of us have the\nconstitution of a Mistborn—some people need sleep and food on occasion.\"\nHe certainly complains a lot more now, Vin thought. However, she\nfound the attitude to be a good sign; it meant OreSeur was growing more\ncomfortable with her. Comfortable enough to tell her when he thought she\nwas being stupid.\nWhy do I even bother with Zane? she thought, rising and turning eyes\nnorthward. The mist was still moderately strong, and she could barely make\nout Straff's army, still holding the northern canal, maintaining the siege. It\nsat like a spider, waiting for the right time to spring.\nElend, she thought. I should be more focused on Elend. His motions to\ndismiss the Assembly's decision, or to force a revote, had all failed. And,\nstubbornly lawful as always, Elend continued to accept his failures. He still\nthought he had a chance to persuade the Assembly to choose him as king—\nor at least not vote anybody else to the position.\nSo he worked on speeches and planned with Breeze and Dockson. This\nleft him little time for Vin, and rightly so. The last thing he needed was her\ndistracting him. This was something she couldn't help him with—something\nshe couldn't fight or scare away.\nHis world is of papers, books, laws, and philosophies, she thought. He\nrides the words of his theories like I ride the mists. I always worry that he\ncan't understand me. . .but can I really even understand him?\nOreSeur stood, stretched, and placed his forepaws on the wall's railing\nto raise himself and look north, like Vin.\nVin shook her head. \"Sometimes, I wish Elend weren't so. . .well,"

He must serve his master—in his case, that\nwould be the city—even if that master makes him do something very\ndistasteful.\"\n\"That's a very kandralike way of seeing things,\" Vin said.\nOreSeur looked up at her, raising a canine eyebrow, as if to ask Well,\nwhat did you expect?

The top of Keep Hasting was a good\nhundred feet tall—far too high up for OreSeur to jump, and the only path\ndown would be through the inside of the abandoned keep. Better to carry\nhim.\n\"Aged meat is like aged wine or aged cheese,\" OreSeur continued. \"It\ntastes better when it's a few weeks old.\"\nI suppose that's one of the side effects of being related to scavengers,\nVin thought. She hopped up on the lip of the wall, dropping a few coins.\nHowever, as she prepared to jump—OreSeur a large bulk in her arms—she\nhesitated. She turned one last time, looking out at Straff's army.

The\nother Worldbringers must have thought themselves humble when they came\nto me, admitting that they had been wrong. Even then, I was beginning to\ndoubt my original declaration.\nBut, I was prideful.\n30\nI write this record now, Sazed read, pounding it into a metal slab,\nbecause I am afraid. Afraid for myself, yes—I admit to being human. If\nAlendi does return from the Well of Ascension, I am certain that my death\nwill be one of his first objectives. He is not an evil man, but he is a ruthless\none. That is, I think, a product of what he has been through.\nI am also afraid, however, that all I have known—that my story—will\nbe forgotten. I am afraid for the world that is to come. Afraid that Alendi\nwill fail. Afraid of a doom brought by the Deepness.\nIt all comes back to poor Alendi. I feel bad for him, and for all the\nthings he has been forced to endure. For what he has been forced to\nbecome.\nBut, let me begin at the beginning. I met Alendi first in Khlennium; he\nwas a young lad then, and had not yet been warped by a decade spent\nleading armies.\nAlendi's height struck me the first time I saw him. Here was a man who\nwas small of stature, but who seemed to tower over others, a man who\ndemanded respect.\nOddly, it was Alendi's simple ingenuousness that first led me to\nbefriend him. I employed him as an assistant during his first months in the\ngrand city.\nIt wasn't until years later that I became convinced that Alendi was the\nHero of Ages. Hero of Ages: the one called Rabzeen in Khlennium, the\nAnamnesor.\nSavior.\nWhen I finally had the realization—finally connected all of the signs of\nthe Anticipation to him—I was so excited. Yet, when I announced my\ndiscovery to the other Worldbringers, I was met with scorn. Oh, how I wish\nthat I had listened to them.\nAnd yet, any who know me will realize that there was no chance I\nwould give up so easily. Once I find something to investigate, I become\ndogged in my pursuit. I had determined that Alendi was the Hero of Ages,\nand I intended to prove it. I should have bowed before the will of the others;\nI shouldn't have insisted on traveling with Alendi to witness his journeys. It\nwas inevitable that Alendi himself would find out what I believed him to be.\nYes, he was the one who fueled the rumors after that. I could never\nhave done what he himself did, convincing and persuading the world that\nhe was indeed the Hero. I don't know if he himself believed it, but he made\nothers think that he must be the one.\nIf only the Terris religion, and belief in the Anticipation, hadn't spread\nbeyond our people. If only the Deepness hadn't come, providing a threat\nthat drove men to desperation both in action and belief. If only I had passed\nover Alendi when looking for an assistant, all those years ago.\nSazed sat back from his work of transcribing the rubbing. There was"

If only I had passed\nover Alendi when looking for an assistant, all those years ago.\nSazed sat back from his work of transcribing the rubbing. There was\nstill a great deal to do—it was amazing how much writing this Kwaan had\nmanaged to cram onto the relatively small sheet of steel.\nSazed looked over his work. He'd spent his entire trip north\nanticipating the time when he could finally begin work on the rubbing. A\npart of him had been worried. Would the dead man's words seem as\nimportant sitting in a well-lit room as they had when in the dungeons of the\nConventical of Seran?\nHe scanned to another part of the document, reading a few choice\nparagraphs. Ones of particular importance to him.\nAs the one who found Alendi, however, I became someone important.\nForemost amongst the Worldbringers.\nThere was a place for me, in the lore of the Anticipation—I thought\nmyself the Announcer, the prophet foretold to discover the Hero of Ages.\nRenouncing Alendi then would have been to renounce my new position, my\nacceptance, by the others.\nAnd so I did not.\nBut I do so now. Let it be known that I, Kwaan, Worldbringer of Terris,\nam a fraud.\nSazed closed his eyes. Worldbringer. The term was known to him; the\norder of the Keepers had been founded upon memories and hopes from\nTerris legends. The Worldbringers had been teachers, Feruchemists who had\ntraveled the lands bearing knowledge. They had been a prime inspiration for\nthe secret order of Keepers.\nAnd now he had a document made by a Worldbringer's own hand.\nTindwyl is going to be very annoyed with me, Sazed thought, opening\nhis eyes. He'd read the entire rubbing, but he would need to spend time\nstudying it. Memorizing it. Cross-referencing it with other documents. This\none bit of writing—perhaps twenty pages total—could easily keep him busy\nfor months, even years.\nHis window shutters rattled. Sazed looked up. He was in his quarters at\nthe palace—a tasteful collection of well-decorated rooms that were far too\nlavish for one who had spent his life as a servant. He rose, walked over to\nthe window, undid the latch, and pulled open the shutters. He smiled as he\nfound Vin crouching on the ledge outside.\n\"Um. . .hi,\" Vin said. She wore her mistcloak over gray shirt and black\ntrousers. Despite the onset of morning, she obviously hadn't yet gone to bed\nafter her nightly prowling. \"You should leave your window unlatched. I\ncan't get in if it's locked. Elend got mad at me for breaking too many\nlatches.\"\n\"I shall try to remember that, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said, and gesturing for\nher to enter.\nVin hopped spryly through the window, mistcloak rustling. \"Try to\nremember?\" she asked. \"You never forget anything. Not even the things you\ndon't have stuck in a metalmind.\"\nShe's grown so much more bold, he thought as she walked over to his\nwriting desk, peering over his work. Even in the months I've been away."

It felt so good to be wearing clean robes again, to have a quiet and\ncomfortable place in which to study. Was he a bad man for preferring this to\ntravel?\nOne month, he thought. I will give myself one month of study. Then I\nwill turn the project over to someone else.\n\"What is it?\" Vin asked, holding up the rubbing.\n\"If you please, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said apprehensively. \"That is quite\nfragile. The rubbing could be smudged. . ..\"\nVin nodded, putting it down and scanning his transcription. There had\nbeen a time when she would have avoided anything that smelled of stuffy\nwriting, but now she looked intrigued. \"This mentions the Deepness!\" she\nsaid with excitement.\n\"Among other things,\" Sazed said, joining her at the desk. He sat\ndown, and Vin walked over to one of the room's low-backed, plush chairs.\nHowever, she didn't sit on it as an ordinary person would; instead, she\nhopped up and sat down on the top of the chair's back, her feet resting on\nthe seat cushion.\n\"What?\" she asked, apparently noticing Sazed's smile.\n\"Just amused at a proclivity of Mistborn, Lady Vin,\" he said. \"Your\nkind has trouble simply sitting—it seems you always want to perch instead.\nThat is what comes from having such an incredible sense of balance, I\nthink.\"\nVin frowned, but passed over the comment. \"Sazed,\" she said, \"what\nwas the Deepness?\"\nHe laced his fingers before himself, regarding the young woman as he\nmused. \"The Deepness, Lady Vin? That is a subject of much debate, I think.\nIt was supposedly something great and powerful, though some scholars\nhave dismissed the entire legend as a fabrication concocted by the Lord\nRuler. There is some reason to believe this theory, I think, for the only real\nrecords of those times are the ones sanctioned by the Steel Ministry.\"\n\"But, the logbook mentions the Deepness,\" Vin said. \"And so does that\nthing you're translating now.\"\n\"Indeed, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said. \"But, even among those who assume\nthe Deepness was real, there is a great deal of debate. Some hold to the\nLord Ruler's official story, that the Deepness was a horrible, supernatural\nbeast—a dark god, if you will. Others disagree with this extreme\ninterpretation. They think the Deepness was more mundane—an army of\nsome sort, perhaps invaders from another land. The Farmost Dominance,\nduring pre-Ascension times, was apparently populated with several breeds\nof men who were quite primitive and warlike.\"\nVin was smiling. He looked at her questioningly, and she just\nshrugged. \"I asked Elend this same question,\" she explained, \"and I got\nbarely a sentence-long response.\"\n\"His Majesty has different areas of scholarship; pre-Ascension history\nmay be too stuffy a topic even for him.

Was the Deepness an army? Was\nit, perhaps, the first attack from koloss, as some theorize? That would\nexplain much—most stories agree that the Lord Ruler gained some power\nto defeat the Deepness at the Well of Ascension. Perhaps he gained the\nsupport of the koloss, and then used them as his armies.\"\n\"Sazed,\" Vin said. \"I don't think the Deepness was the koloss.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"I think it was the mist.\"\n\"That theory has been proposed,\" Sazed said with a nod.\n\"It has?\" Vin asked, sounding a bit disappointed.\n\"Of course, Lady Vin. During the thousand-year reign of the Final\nEmpire, there are few possibilities that haven't been discussed, I think. The\nmist theory has been advanced before, but there are several large problems\nwith it.\"\n\"Such as?\"\n\"Well,\" Sazed said, \"for one thing, the Lord Ruler is said to have\ndefeated the Deepness. However, the mist is obviously still here. Also, if the\nDeepness was simply mist, why call it by such an obscure name? Of course,\nothers point out that much of what we know or have heard of the Deepness\ncomes from oral lore, and something very common can take on mystical\nproperties when transferred verbally through generations. The 'Deepness'\ntherefore could mean not just the mist, but the event of its coming or\nalteration.\n\"The larger problem with the mist theory, however, is one of\nmalignance. If we trust the accounts—and we have little else to go on—the\nDeepness was terrible and destructive. The mist seems to display none of\nthis danger.\"\n\"But it kills people now.\"\nSazed paused. \"Yes, Lady Vin. It apparently does.\"\n\"And what if it did so before, but the Lord Ruler stopped it somehow?\nYou yourself said that you think we did something—something that\nchanged the mist—when we killed the Lord Ruler.\"\nSazed nodded. \"The problems I have been investigating are quite\nterrible, to be certain. However, I do not see that they could be a threat on\nthe same level as the Deepness. Certain people have been killed by the\nmists, but many are elderly or otherwise lacking in constitution. It leaves\nmany people alone.\"\nHe paused, tapping his thumbs together. \"But, I would be remiss if I\ndidn't admit some merit to the suggestion, Lady Vin. Perhaps even a few\ndeaths would be enough to cause a panic. The danger could have been\nexaggerated by retelling—and, perhaps the killings were more widespread\nbefore. I haven't been able to collect enough information to be certain of\nanything yet.\"\nVin didn't respond. Oh, dear, Sazed thought, sighing to himself. I've\nbored her.

She unfolded the\nwrinkled sheet and flattened it on the desk.\n\"These are quotes from the logbook,\" Vin said. She pointed at a\nparagraph. \"Here the Lord Ruler talks about how armies were useless\nagainst the Deepness. At first, I thought this meant that the armies hadn't\nbeen able to defeat it—but look at the wording. He says 'The swords of my\narmies are useless.' What's more useless than trying to swing a sword at\nmist?\"\nShe pointed at another paragraph. \"It left destruction in its wake, right?\nCountless thousands died because of it. But, he never says that the\nDeepness actually attacked them. He says that they 'died because of it.'\nMaybe we've just been looking at this the wrong way all along. Those\npeople weren't crushed or eaten. They starved to death because their land\nwas slowly being swallowed by the mists.\"\nSazed studied her paper. She seemed so certain. Did she know nothing\nof proper research techniques? Of questioning, of studying, of postulating\nand devising answers?\nOf course she doesn't, Sazed chastised himself. She grew up on the\nstreets—she doesn't use research techniques.\nShe just uses instinct. And she's usually right.\nHe smoothed the paper again, reading its passages. \"Lady Vin? Did\nyou write this yourself?\"\nShe flushed. \"Why is everybody so surprised about that?\"\n\"It just doesn't seem in your nature, Lady Vin.\"\n\"You people have corrupted me,\" she said. \"Look, there isn't a single\ncomment on this sheet that contradicts the idea that the Deepness was mist.\"\n\"Not contradicting a point and proving it are different things, Lady\nVin.\"\nShe waved indifferently. \"I'm right, Sazed. I know I am.\"\n\"What about this point, then?\" Sazed asked, pointing to a line. \"The\nHero implies that he can sense a sentience to the Deepness.

I have had much training as a servant, and we\nare taught to be nonconfrontational. Nevertheless, I do not think that you\nare wrong. However, I also think that, perhaps, you haven't fully considered\nyour position.\"\nVin shrugged.\n\"What makes you think that the Hero of Ages will return?\"\n\"I don't know. Things that happen; things I feel. The mists are coming\nagain, and someone needs to stop them.\"\nSazed ran his fingers across his translated section of the rubbing,\nlooking over its words.\n\"You don't believe me,\" Vin said.\n\"It isn't that, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said. \"It's just that I am not prone to\nrushing to decisions.\"\n\"But, you've thought about the Hero of Ages, haven't you?\" Vin said.\n\"He was part of your religion—the lost religion of Terris, the thing you\nKeepers were founded to try and discover.\"\n\"That is true,\" Sazed admitted. \"However, we do not know much about\nthe prophecies that our ancestors used to find their Hero. Besides, the\nreading I've been doing lately suggests that there was something wrong with\ntheir interpretations. If the greatest theologians of pre-Ascension Terris\nwere unable to properly identify their Hero, how are we supposed to do\nso?\"\nVin sat quietly. \"I shouldn't have brought it up,\" she finally said.\n\"No, Lady Vin, please don't think that. I apologize—your theories have\ngreat merit. I simply have a scholar's mind, and must question and consider\ninformation when I am given it. I am far too fond of arguing, I think.\"\nVin looked up, smiling slightly. \"Another reason you never made a\ngood Terris steward?\"\n\"Undoubtedly,\" he said with a sigh. \"My attitude also tends to cause\nconflicts with the others of my order.\"\n\"Like Tindwyl?\" Vin asked. \"She didn't sound happy when she heard\nthat you'd told us about Feruchemy.\"\nSazed nodded. \"For a group dedicated to knowledge, the Keepers can\nbe rather stingy with information about their powers. When the Lord Ruler\nstill lived—when Keepers were hunted—the caution was warranted, I think.\nBut, now that we are free from that, my brethren and sisters seem to have\nfound the habit of secrecy a difficult one to break.\"\nVin nodded. \"Tindwyl doesn't seem to like you very much. She says\nthat she came because of your suggestion, but every time someone\nmentions you, she seems to get. . .cold.\"\nSazed sighed. Did Tindwyl dislike him? He thought, perhaps, that her\ninability to do so was a large part of the problem. \"She is simply\ndisappointed in me, Lady Vin. I'm not sure how much you know of my\nhistory, but I had been working against the Lord Ruler for some ten years\nbefore Kelsier recruited me. The other Keepers thought that I endangered\nmy copperminds, and the very order itself. They believed that the Keepers\nshould remain quiet—waiting for the day when the Lord Ruler fell, but not\nseeking to make it happen.\"\n\"Seems a bit cowardly to me,\" Vin said."

You see, Lady Vin, had I been\ncaptured, there are many things I could have revealed. The names of other\nKeepers, the location of our safe houses, the means by which we managed\nto hide ourselves in Terris culture. My brethren worked for many decades to\nmake the Lord Ruler think that Feruchemy had finally been exterminated.\nBy revealing myself, I could have undone all of that.\"\n\"That would only have been bad had we failed,\" Vin said. \"We didn't.\"\n\"We could have.\"\n\"We didn't.\"\nSazed paused, then smiled. Sometimes, in a world of debate, questions,\nand self-doubt, Vin's simple bluntness was refreshing. \"Regardless,\" he\ncontinued, \"Tindwyl is a member of the Synod—a group of Keeper elders\nwho guide our sect. I have been in rebellion against the Synod a number of\ntimes during my past. And, by returning to Luthadel, I am defying them\nonce again. She has good reason to be displeased with me.\"\n\"Well, I think you're doing the right thing,\" Vin said. \"We need you.\"\n\"Thank you, Lady Vin.\"\n\"I don't think you have to listen to Tindwyl,\" she said. \"She's the type\nwho acts like she knows more than she does.\"\n\"She is very wise.\"\n\"She's hard on Elend.\"\n\"Then she probably does so because it is best for him,\" Sazed said.\n\"Do not judge her too harshly, child. If she seems off-putting, it is only\nbecause she has lived a very hard life.\"\n\"Hard life?\" Vin asked, tucking her notes back into her pocket.\n\"Yes, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said. \"You see, Tindwyl spent most of her life\nas a Terris mother.\"\nVin hesitated, hand in pocket, looking surprised. \"You mean. . .she was\na Breeder?\"\nSazed nodded. The Lord Ruler's breeding program included selecting a\nfew, special individuals to use for birthing new children—with the goal\nbeing to breed Feruchemy out of the population.\n\"Tindwyl had, at last count, birthed over twenty children,\" he said.\n\"Each with a different father. Tindwyl had her first child when she was\nfourteen, and spent her entire life being taken repeatedly by strange men\nuntil she became pregnant. And, because of the fertility drugs the Breeding\nmasters forced upon her, she often bore twins or triplets.\"\n\"I. . .see,\" Vin said softly.\n\"You are not the only one who knew a terrible childhood, Lady Vin.\nTindwyl is perhaps the strongest woman I know.\"\n\"How did she bear it?\" Vin asked quietly. \"I think. . .I think I would\nprobably have just killed myself.\"\n\"She is a Keeper,\" Sazed said. \"She suffered the indignity because she\nknew that she did a great service for her people.

Even now, he could see that\nword in the eyes of some of the other Assemblymen. They regarded Philen\nand his fellow merchants with the same disdain that they gave the eight\nskaa workers on the Assembly. Couldn't they see that the two groups were\ncompletely different?\nPhilen shifted a bit on the bench. Shouldn't the Assembly hall at least\nhave comfortable seating? They were waiting on just a few members; the\ntall clock in the corner said that fifteen minutes still remained until the\nmeeting began. Oddly, one of those who had yet to arrive was Venture\nhimself. King Elend was usually early.\nNot king anymore, Philen thought with a smile. Just plain old Elend\nVenture. It was a poor name—not as good as Philen's own. Of course, he\nhad been just \"Lin\" until a year and a half ago. Philen Frandeu was what he\nhad dubbed himself after the Collapse. It delighted him to no end that the\nothers had taken to calling him the name without pause. But, why shouldn't\nhe have a grand name? A lord's name? Was Philen not as good as any of the\n\"noblemen\" sitting aloofly in their places?\nOh, he was just as good. Better, even. Yes, they had called him skaa—\nbut during those years, they had come to him out of need, and so their\narrogant sneers had lacked power. He'd seen their insecurity. They'd needed\nhim.

And, where\nthere had been obligators, nothing illegal could occur. Hence Philen. He'd\nbeen. . .an intermediary, of sorts. A man capable of arranging deals between\ninterested parties who, for various reasons, wanted to avoid the watchful\neyes of the Lord Ruler's obligators. Philen hadn't been part of a thieving\ncrew—no, that was far too dangerous. And far too mundane.\nHe had been born with an eye for finances and trades. Give him two\nrocks, and he'd have a quarry by the end of the week. Give him a spoke, and\nhe'd change it to a fine horse-drawn carriage. Two bits of corn, and he'd\neventually have a massive shipment of grain sailing to the Farmost\nDominance markets. Actual noblemen had done the trades, of course, but\nPhilen had been behind it all. A vast empire of his own.\nAnd still, they couldn't see. He wore a suit as fine as theirs; now that\nhe could trade openly, he had become one of the wealthiest men in\nLuthadel. Yet, the noblemen ignored him, just because he lacked a valid\npedigree.\nWell, they would see. After today's meeting. . .yes, they would see.\nPhilen looked out into the crowd, looking anxiously for the person he had\nhidden there. Reassured, he looked toward the noblemen of the Assembly,\nwho sat chatting a short distance away. One of their last members—Lord\nFerson Penrod—had just arrived. The older man walked up onto the\nAssembly's dais, passing by the members, greeting each in turn.\n\"Philen,\" Penrod said, noticing him. \"A new suit, I see. The red vest\nsuits you.\"\n\"Lord Penrod! Why, you're looking well. You got over the other night's\nailment, then?\"\n\"Yes, it passed quickly,\" the lord said, nodding a head topped with\nsilver hair. \"Just a touch of stomach ills.\"\nPity, Philen thought, smiling. \"Well, we'd best be seated. I see that\nyoung Venture isn't here, though. . ..\"\n\"Yes,\" Penrod said, frowning. He'd been most difficult to convince to\nvote against Venture; he had something of a fondness for the boy. He had\ncome around in the end. They all had.\nPenrod moved on, joining the other noblemen. The old fool probably\nthought he was going to end up as king. Well, Philen had other plans for\nthat throne. It wasn't Philen's own posterior that would sit in it, of course; he\nhad no interest in running a country. Seemed like a terrible way to make\nmoney. Selling things. That was a much better way. More stable, less likely\nto lose one his head.\nOh, but Philen had plans. He'd always had those.

Even Venture hadn't understood that merchants weren't skaa.\nPhilen wrinkled his nose. Even though the skaa Assemblymen usually\ncleaned up before coming to the meetings, he could smell the stink of\nforges, mills, and shops on them. Men who made things. Philen would have\nto be certain they were put back in their place, once this was over. An\nAssembly was an interesting idea, but it should be filled only with those\nwho deserved the station. Men like Philen.\nLord Philen, he thought. Not long now.\nHopefully, Elend would be late. Then, maybe they could avoid his\nspeech.

Benches fanned out before the stage, benches crowded\nwith people, mostly skaa. Philen wasn't sure why they were allowed to\nattend. They couldn't vote or anything.\nMore Venture foolishness, he thought, shaking his head. At the very\nback of the room—behind the crowd, opposite the stage—sat two large,\nbroad doors letting in the red sunlight. Philen nodded toward some men,\nand they pushed the doors shut.

And yet, she seemed to wear it well,\nwalking gracefully. She actually looked rather fetching.\nAt least, until Philen met her eyes. She did not have a warm look for\nthe Assembly members, and Philen glanced away. Venture had brought all\nof his Allomancers with him—the former thugs of the Survivor's crew.\nElend apparently wanted to remind everyone who his friends were.\nPowerful men. Frightening men.\nMen who killed gods.\nAnd Elend had not one, but two Terrismen with him. One was only a\nwoman—Philen had never seen a Terriswoman before—but still, it was\nimpressive. Everyone had heard how the stewards had left their masters\nafter the Collapse; they refused to work as servants anymore. Where had\nVenture found not one, but two of the colorful-robed stewards to serve him?\nThe crowd sat quietly, watching Venture. Some seemed uncomfortable.\nHow were they to treat this man? Others seemed. . .awed? Was that right?\nWho would be awed by Elend Venture—even if the Elend Venture in\nquestion was clean-shaven, had styled hair, wore new clothing and. . .?\nPhilen frowned. Was that a dueling cane the king was wearing? And a\nwolfhound at his side?\nHe's not king anymore! Philen reminded himself again.\nVenture strode up onto the Assembly stage. He turned, waving for his\npeople—all eight of them—to sit with the guards. Venture then turned and\nglanced at Philen. \"Philen, did you want to say something?\"\nPhilen realized he was still standing. \"I. . .was just—\"\n\"Are you Assembly chancellor?\" Elend asked.\nPhilen paused. \"Chancellor?\"\n\"The king presides at Assembly meetings,\" Elend said. \"We now have\nno king—and so, by law, the Assembly should have elected a chancellor to\ncall speakers, adjudicate time allotments, and break tie votes.\" He paused,\neyeing Philen. \"Someone needs to lead. Otherwise there is chaos.\"\nDespite himself, Philen grew nervous. Did Venture know that Philen\nhad organized the vote against him? No, no he didn't, he couldn't. He was\nlooking at each of the Assembly members in turn, meeting their eyes. There\nwas none of the jovial, dismissible boy that had attended these meetings\nbefore. Standing in the militaristic suit, firm instead of hesitant. . .he almost\nseemed like a different person.\nYou found a coach, it appears, Philen thought. A little too late. Just\nwait. . ..\nPhilen sat down. \"Actually, we didn't get a chance to choose a\nchancellor,\" he said. \"We were just getting to that.\"\nElend nodded, a dozen different instructions rattling in his head. Keep\neye contact. Use subtle, but firm, expressions. Never appear hurried, but\ndon't seem hesitant. Sit down without wiggling, don't shuffle, use a straight\nposture, don't form your hands into fists when you're nervous. . ..\nHe shot a quick glance at Tindwyl. She gave him a nod."

It was a passably appropriate\nexpression for one with such a sharp face and dark hair.\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"I'm hardly an unbiased party in today's proceedings.\nTherefore, I nominate Lord Penrod. He's as honorable a man as we're likely\nto find, and I believe he can be trusted to mediate our discussions.\"\nThe group was quiet for a moment.\n\"That seems logical,\" Hettel, a forge worker, finally said.\n\"All in favor?\" Elend said, raising his hand. He got a good eighteen\nhands—all of the skaa, most of the nobility, only one of the merchants. It\nwas a majority, however.\nElend turned to Lord Penrod. \"I believe that means that you are in\ncharge, Ferson.\"\nThe stately man nodded appreciatively, then rose to formally open the\nmeeting, something Elend had once done. Penrod's mannerisms were\npolished, his posture strong as he stood in his well-cut suit. Elend couldn't\nhelp but feel a little jealous, watching Penrod act so naturally in the things\nthat Elend was struggling to learn.\nMaybe he would make a better king than I, Elend thought. Perhaps. . .\nNo, he thought firmly. I have to be confident. Penrod is a decent man\nand an impeccable noble, but those things do not make a leader. He hasn't\nread what I've read, and doesn't understand legislative theory as I do. He's\na good man, but he's still a product of his society—he doesn't consider skaa\nanimals, but he'll never be able to think of them as equals.\nPenrod finished the introductions, then turned to Elend. \"Lord Venture,\nyou called this meeting. I believe that the law grants you first opportunity to\naddress the Assembly.\"\nElend nodded thankfully, rising.\n\"Will twenty minutes be enough time?\" Penrod asked.\n\"It should be,\" Elend said, passing Penrod as they traded places. Elend\nstood up at the lectern. To his right, the floor of the hall was packed with\nshuffling, coughing, whispering people. There was a tension to the room—\nthis was the first time Elend had confronted the group that had betrayed\nhim.\n\"As many of you know,\" Elend said to the twenty-three Assembly\nmembers, \"I recently returned from a meeting with Straff Venture—the\nwarlord who is, unfortunately, my father. I would like to give a report of\nthis encounter. Realize that because this is an open meeting, I will adjust my\nreport to avoid mentioning sensitive matters of national security.\"\nHe paused just slightly, and saw the looks of confusion he had\nexpected.

I can understand why people\nwould be concerned, particularly because of last week's preliminary assault\non our walls. That, however, was simply a test—Straff fears attacking too\nmuch to commit all of his resources.\n\"During our meeting, Straff told me that he had made an alliance with\nCett. However, I believe this to have been a bluff—if, unfortunately, a bluff\nwith teeth. I suspect that he was, indeed, planning to risk attacking us,\ndespite Cett's presence. That attack has been halted.\"\n\"Why?\" asked one of the worker representatives. \"Because you're his\nson?\"\n\"No, actually,\" Elend said. \"Straff is not one to let familial\nrelationships hamper his determination.\" Elend paused, glancing at Vin. He\nwas beginning to realize that she didn't like being the one who held the\nknife at Straff's throat, but she had given him permission to speak of her in\nhis speech.\nStill. . .\nShe said it was all right, he told himself. I'm not choosing duty over\nher!\n\"Come now, Elend,\" Philen said. \"Stop with the theatrics.

News of what he'd just said would reach the populace,\nand bring them strength. Perhaps, even, news would reach Straff's army\nthrough the spies Elend knew must be in the audience. He'd noticed his\nfather's Allomancer sitting in the crowd, the one named Zane.\nAnd when news reached Straff's army, the men there might think twice\nabout obeying any orders to attack. Who would want to face the very force\nthat had destroyed the Lord Ruler? It was a weak hope—the men of Straff's\narmy probably didn't believe all of the stories out of Luthadel—but every\nlittle bit of weakened morale would help.\nIt also wouldn't hurt for Elend to associate himself a little more\nstrongly with the Survivor. He was just going to have to get over his\ninsecurity; Kelsier had been a great man, but he was gone. Elend would just\nhave to do his best to see that the Survivor's legacy lived on.\nFor that was what would be best for his people.\nVin sat with a twisted stomach, listening to Elend's speech.\n\"You okay with this?\" Ham whispered, leaning over to her as Elend\ngave a more detailed account of his visit with Straff.\nVin shrugged. \"Whatever helps the kingdom.\"\n\"You were never comfortable with the way that Kell set himself up\nwith the skaa—none of us were.\"\n\"It's what Elend needs,\" Vin said.\nTindwyl, who sat just before them, turned and gave her a flat look. Vin\nexpected some recrimination for whispering during the Assembly\nproceedings, but apparently the Terriswoman had a different kind of\ncastigation in mind.\n\"The king—\" She still referred to Elend that way. \"—needs this link\nwith the Survivor. Elend has very little of his own authority to rely upon,\nand Kelsier is currently the most well loved, most celebrated man in the\nCentral Dominance. By implying that the government was founded by the\nSurvivor, the king will make the people think twice about meddling with it.\"\nHam nodded thoughtfully. Vin glanced downward, however. What's\nthe problem? Just earlier, I was beginning to wonder if I were the Hero of\nAges, and now I'm worried about the notoriety Elend is giving me?\nShe sat uncomfortably, burning bronze, feeling the pulsing from far\naway.

It was growing even louder. . ..\nStop it! she told herself. Sazed doesn't think the Hero would return,\nand he knows the histories better than anyone. It was foolish, anyway. I\nneed to focus on what's happening here.\nAfter all, Zane was in the audience.\nVin sought out his face near the back of the room, a light burn of tin—\nnot enough to blind her—letting her study his features. He wasn't looking at\nher, but watching the Assembly. Was he working at Straff's command, or\nwas this visit his own? Straff and Cett both undoubtedly had spies in the\naudience—and, of course, Ham had guards mixed with the people as well.\nZane unnerved her, however. Why didn't he turn toward her? Wasn't—\nZane met her eyes. He smiled slightly, then turned back to his study of\nElend.\nVin felt a shiver despite herself. So, did this mean he wasn't avoiding\nher? Focus! She told herself. You need to pay attention to what Elend is\nsaying.\nHe was almost done, however. He wrapped up his speech with a few\ncomments on how he thought they could keep Straff off-balance. Again, he\ncouldn't be too detailed—not without giving away secrets. He glanced at the\nlarge clock in the corner; done three minutes early, he moved to leave the\nlectern.\nLord Penrod cleared his throat. \"Elend, aren't you forgetting\nsomething?\"\nElend hesitated, then looked back at the Assembly. \"What is it that you\nall want me to say?\"\n\"Don't you have a reaction?\" one of the skaa workers said. \"About. .\n.what happened at the last meeting?\"\n\"You received my missive,\" Elend said. \"You know how I feel about\nthe matter. However, this public forum is not a place for accusations or\ndenunciations. The Assembly is too noble a body for that kind of thing. I\nwish that a time of danger were not when the Assembly had chosen to voice\nits concerns, but we cannot alter what has happened.\"\nHe moved to sit again.\n\"That's it?\" asked one of the skaa. \"You're not even going to argue for\nyourself, try and persuade us to reinstate you?\"\nElend paused again. \"No,\" he said. \"No, I don't think that I will. You\nhave made your opinions known to me, and I am disappointed. However,\nyou are the representatives chosen by the people. I believe in the power that\nyou have been given.\n\"If you have questions, or challenges, I will be happy to defend\nmyself. However, I am not going to stand and preach my virtues. You all\nknow me. You know what I can do, and what I intend to do, for this city and\nthe surrounding populace. Let that stand as my argument.\"\nHe returned to his seat. Vin could see hints of a frown on Tindwyl's\nface. Elend hadn't given the speech that she and he had prepared, a speech\ngiving the very arguments the Assembly was obviously expecting.\nWhy the change? Vin wondered.

Tindwyl obviously didn't think it was\na good idea. And yet, oddly, Vin found herself trusting Elend's instincts\nmore than she did Tindwyl's.\n\"Well,\" Lord Penrod said, approaching the lectern again. \"Thank you\nfor that report, Lord Venture. I'm not certain if we have other items of\nbusiness. . ..\"\n\"Lord Penrod?\" Elend asked.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Perhaps you should hold the nominations?\"\nLord Penrod frowned.\n\"The nominations for king, Penrod,\" Philen snapped.\nVin paused, eyeing the merchant. He certainly seems up on things, she\nnoted.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said, eyeing Philen as well. \"In order for the Assembly to\nchoose a new king, nominations must be held at least three days before the\nactual voting. I suggest we hold the nominations now, so that we can hold\nthe vote as soon as possible. The city suffers each day it is without a\nleader.\"\nElend paused, then smiled. \"Unless, of course, you intend to let the\nmonth lapse without choosing a new king. . ..\"\nGood to confirm that he still wants the crown, Vin thought.\n\"Thank you, Lord Venture,\" Penrod said. \"We'll do that now, then. . ..\nAnd, how exactly do we proceed?\"\n\"Each member of the Assembly may make one nomination, if he\nwishes,\" Elend said. \"So that we don't become overburdened with options, I\nwould recommend that we all exercise restraint—only choose someone that\nyou honestly and sincerely think would make the finest king. If you have a\nnomination to make, you may stand and announce it to the rest of the\ngroup.\"\nPenrod nodded, returning to his seat. Almost as soon as he sat,\nhowever, one of the skaa stood. \"I nominate Lord Penrod.\"\nElend had to expect that, Vin thought. After nominating Penrod to be\nchancellor. Why give such authority to the man that he knew would be his\ngreatest contender for the throne?\nThe answer was simple. Because Elend knew that Lord Penrod was the\nbest choice for chancellor. Sometimes, he's a little too honorable, Vin\nthought, not for the first time. She turned to study the skaa Assemblyman\nwho had nominated Penrod. Why were the skaa so quick to unify behind a\nnobleman?\nShe suspected that it was still too soon. The skaa were accustomed to\nbeing led by noblemen, and even with their freedom, they were traditional\nbeings—more traditional, even, than the noblemen. A lord like Penrod—\ncalm, commanding—seemed inherently better suited to the title of king than\na skaa.\nThey'll have to get over that, eventually, Vin thought. At least, they will\nif they're ever going to be the people that Elend wants them to be.\nThe room remained quiet, no other nominations being made. A few\npeople coughed in the audience, even the whispers now dead. Finally, Lord\nPenrod himself stood.\n\"I nominate Elend Venture,\" he said.\n\"Ah. . .\" someone whispered behind her."

Finally, Lord\nPenrod himself stood.\n\"I nominate Elend Venture,\" he said.\n\"Ah. . .\" someone whispered behind her.\nVin turned, glancing at Breeze. \"What?\" she whispered.\n\"Brilliant,\" Breeze said. \"Don't you see? Penrod is an honorable man.\nOr, at least, as honorable as noblemen get—which means that he insists on\nbeing seen as honorable. Elend nominated Penrod for chancellor. . ..\"\nHoping, in turn, that Penrod would feel obligated to nominate Elend\nfor king, Vin realized. She glanced at Elend, noting a slight smile on his\nlips. Had he really crafted the exchange? It seemed a move subtle enough\nfor Breeze himself.\nBreeze shook his head appreciatively. \"Not only did Elend not have to\nnominate himself—which would have made him look desperate—but now\neveryone on the Assembly thinks that the man they respect, the man they\nwould probably choose as king, would rather have Elend hold the title.\nBrilliant.\"\nPenrod sat, and the room remained quiet. Vin suspected that he also\nhad made the nomination so that he wouldn't go uncontested to the throne.\nThe entire Assembly probably thought that Elend deserved a chance to\nreclaim his place; Penrod was just the one who was honorable enough to\nvoice the feeling.\nBut, what about the merchants? Vin thought. They've got to have their\nown plan. Elend thought that it was probably Philen who had organized the\nvote against him. They'd want to put one of their own on the throne, one\nwho could open the city gates to whichever of the kings was manipulating\nthem—or whichever one paid the best.\nShe studied the group of eight men, in their suits that seemed—\nsomehow—even more fine than those of the noblemen. They all seemed to\nbe waiting on the whims of a single man. What was Philen planning?\nOne of the merchants moved as if to stand, but Philen shot him a harsh\nglance. The merchant did not rise. Philen sat quietly, a nobleman's dueling\ncane across his lap. Finally, when most of the room had noticed the\nmerchant's focus on him, he slowly rose to his feet.\n\"I have a nomination of my own,\" he said.\nThere was a snort from the skaa section. \"Now who's being\nmelodramatic, Philen?\" one of the Assemblymen there said. \"Just go ahead\nand do it—nominate yourself.\"\nPhilen raised an eyebrow. \"Actually, I'm not going to nominate\nmyself.\"\nVin frowned, and she saw confusion in Elend's eyes.\n\"Though I appreciate the sentiment,\" Philen continued, \"I am but a\nsimple merchant. No, I think that the title of king should go to someone\nwhose skills are a little more specialized. Tell me, Lord Venture, must our\nnominations be for people on the Assembly?\"\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"The king doesn't have to be an Assemblyman—I\naccepted this position after the fact. The king's primary duty is that of\ncreating, then enforcing, the law. The Assembly is only an advisory council\nwith some measure of counterbalancing power. The king himself can be\nanyone—actually, the title was intended to be hereditary. I didn't expect. ."

Someone who has shown skill\nwith leadership. Therefore, I nominate Lord Ashweather Cett to be our\nking!\"\nWhat? Vin thought with shock as Philen turned, gesturing toward the\naudience. A man sitting there removed his skaa cloak, pulling down the\nhood, revealing a suit and a face with a bristling beard.\n\"Oh dear. . .\" Breeze said.\n\"It's actually him?\" Vin asked incredulously as the whispers began in\nthe audience.\nBreeze nodded. \"Oh, that's him. Lord Cett himself.\" He paused, then\neyed her. \"I think we might be in trouble.\"\nI had never received much attention from my brethren; they thought\nthat my work and my interests were unsuitable to a Worldbringer. The\ncouldn't see how my work, studying nature instead of religion, benefited the\npeople of the fourteen lands.\n32\nVIN SAT QUIETLY, TENSELY, SCANNING the crowd. Cett\nwouldn't have come alone, she thought.\nAnd then she saw them, now that she knew what she was looking for.\nSoldiers in the crowd, dressed like skaa, forming a small protective buffer\naround Cett's seat. The king did not rise, though a young man at his side\ndid.\nMaybe thirty guards, Vin thought. He may not be foolish enough to\ncome alone. . .but entering the very city you're besieging? It was a bold\nmove—one that bordered on stupidity. Of course, many had said the same\nabout Elend's visit to Straff's army.\nBut Cett wasn't in the same position as Elend. He wasn't desperate,\nwasn't in danger of losing everything. Except. . .he had a smaller army than\nStraff, and the koloss were coming. And if Straff did secure the supposed\natium supply, Cett's days as leader in the West would certainly be\nnumbered. Coming into Luthadel might not have been an act of desperation,\nbut it also wasn't the act of a man who held the upper hand. Cett was\ngambling.\nAnd he seemed to be enjoying it.\nCett smiled as the room waited in silence, Assemblymen and audience\nalike too shocked to speak. Finally, Cett waved to a few of his disguised\nsoldiers, and the men picked up Cett's chair and carried it to the stage.\nAssemblymen whispered and commented, turning to aides or companions,\nseeking confirmation of Cett's identity. Most of the noblemen sat quietly—\nwhich should have been enough of a confirmation, in Vin's mind.\n\"He's not what I expected,\" Vin whispered to Breeze as the soldiers\nclimbed up on the dais.\n\"Nobody told you he was crippled?\" Breeze asked.\n\"Not just that,\" Vin said. \"He's not wearing a suit.\" He had on a pair of\ntrousers and a shirt, but instead of a nobleman's suit coat, he was wearing a\nworn black jacket. \"Plus, that beard.

Not everybody\ndresses like they do here.\"\nBreeze nodded. \"Cett was the most powerful nobleman in his area, so\nhe needn't worry about tradition and propriety.

Cett sat in his chair, having yet to\nspeak. Finally, Lord Penrod stood. \"This is most unexpected, Lord Cett.\"\n\"Good!\" Cett said. \"That was, after all, the point!\"\n\"Do you wish to address the Assembly?\"\n\"I thought I already was.\"\nPenrod cleared his throat, and Vin's tin-enhanced ears heard a\ndisparaging mutter from the noblemen's section regarding \"Western\nnoblemen.\"\n\"You have ten minutes, Lord Cett,\" Penrod said, sitting.\n\"Good,\" Cett said. \"Because—unlike the boy over there—I intend to\ntell you exactly why you should make me king.\"\n\"And that is?\" one of the merchant Assemblymen asked.\n\"Because I've got an army on your damn doorstep!\" Cett said with a\nlaugh.\nThe Assembly looked taken aback.\n\"A threat, Cett?\" Elend asked calmly.\n\"No, Venture,\" Cett replied. \"Just honesty—something you Central\nnoblemen seem to avoid at all cost. A threat is only a promise turned\naround. What was it you told these people? That your mistress had her knife\nat Straff's throat? So, were you implying that if you weren't elected, you'd\nhave your Mistborn withdraw, and let the city be destroyed?\"\nElend flushed. \"Of course not.\"\n\"Of course not,\" Cett repeated. He had a loud voice—unapologetic,\nforceful. \"Well, I don't pretend, and I don't hide. My army is here, and my\nintention is to take this city. However, I'd much rather that you just give it to\nme.\"\n\"You, sir, are a tyrant,\" Penrod said flatly.\n\"So?\" Cett asked. \"I'm a tyrant with forty thousand soldiers. That's\ntwice what you've got guarding these walls.\"\n\"What's to stop us from simply taking you hostage?\" asked one of the\nother noblemen. \"You seem to have delivered yourself to us quite neatly.\"\nCett bellowed a laugh. \"If I don't return to my camp this evening, my\narmy has orders to attack and raze the city immediately—no matter what!\nThey'll probably get destroyed by Venture afterward—but it won't matter to\nme, or to you, at that point! We'll all be dead.\"\nThe room fell silent.\n\"See, Venture?\" Cett asked. \"Threats work wonderfully.\"\n\"You honestly expect us to make you our king?\" Elend asked."

No, Elend, don't—\n\"Yes, they have,\" Elend admitted.\nVin heard Tindwyl groan quietly.\n\"And,\" Cett continued, \"can you honestly say that you've never\ndoubted yourself?

I know how to make myself strong, and that means I know how to\nmake those who associate with me strong as well.\n\"Here's the deal. You give me the crown, and I'll take charge here.

And besides, Cett has promised us all\ntitles.\"\nThis gave the group something to think about.\n\"Why not just give me the crown now?\" Cett said. \"Open your gates to\nmy army.\"\n\"You can't,\" Elend said immediately. \"Not until there is a king—or\nunless you can get a unanimous vote right now.\"\nVin smiled. Unanimous wouldn't happen in that case as long as Elend\nwas on the Assembly.\n\"Bah,\" Cett said, but he obviously was smooth enough not to insult the\nlegislative body further. \"Let me take up residence in the city, then.\"\nPenrod nodded. \"All in favor of allowing Lord Cett to take up\nresidence inside with. . .say. . .a thousand troops?\"\nA full nineteen of the Assemblymen raised their hands. Elend was not\none of them.\n\"It is done, then,\" Penrod said. \"We adjourn for two weeks.\"\nThis can't be happening, Elend thought. I thought maybe Penrod\nwould provide a challenge, Philen a lesser one. But. . .one of the very\ntyrants who is threatening the city? How could they? How could they even\nconsider his suggestion?\nElend stood, catching Penrod's arm as he turned to walk off the dais.\n\"Ferson,\" Elend said quietly, \"this is insanity.\"\n\"We have to consider the option, Elend.\"\n\"Consider selling out the people of this city to a tyrant?\"\nPenrod's face grew cold, and he shook Elend's arm free. \"Listen, lad,\"\nhe said quietly. \"You are a good man, but you've always been an idealist.\nYou've spent time in books and philosophy—I've spent my life fighting\npolitics with the members of the court.

Elend stood quietly for a moment.\nWe have seen a curious phenomenon associated with rebel groups that\nbreak off of the Final Empire and attempt to seek autonomy, he thought,\nrecalling a passage from Ytves's book Studies in Revolution. In almost all\ncases, the Lord Ruler didn't need to send his armies to reconquer the rebels.\nBy the time his agents arrived, the groups had overthrown themselves.\nIt seems that the rebels found the chaos of transition more difficult to\naccept than the tyranny they had known before.

Considering the last\nfew days of chaos, it was surprising to her that she found returning to her\nstudies to be a relief.\nA small one, however, for her studies held their own problems. The\nDeepness has returned, she thought. Even if the mists only kill infrequently,\nthey've begun to turn hostile again. That means the Hero of Ages needs to\ncome again too, doesn't it?\nDid she honestly think that might be her? It sounded ridiculous, when\nshe considered it. Yet, she heard the thumping in her head, saw the spirit in\nthe mists. . ..\nAnd what of that night, over a year gone, when she'd confronted the\nLord Ruler? That night when somehow, she'd drawn the mists into herself,\nburning them as if they were metal?\nThat's not enough, she told herself. One freak event—one I've never\nbeen able to replicate—doesn't mean I'm some mythological savior. She\ndidn't even really know most of the prophecies about the Hero. The logbook\nmentioned that he was supposed to come from humble origins—but that\npretty much described every skaa in the Final Empire. He was supposed to\nhave hidden royal bloodlines, but that made every half-breed in the city a\ncandidate. In fact, she'd be willing to bet that most skaa had one or another\nhidden nobleman progenitor.\nShe sighed, shaking her head.\n\"Mistress?\" OreSeur asked, turning. He stood on a chair, his forepaws\nup against the window as he looked out at the city.\n\"Prophecies, legends, foretellings,\" Vin said, slapping her hand down\non her sheet of notes. \"What's the point? Why did the Terris even believe in\nthese things?

Thump. . ..\n\"You need not apologize to me, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"I am only\nkandra.\"\n\"Still a person,\" Vin said. \"If one with dog breath.\"\nOreSeur smiled. \"You chose these bones for me, Mistress.

Honestly, we have to get you\nsome mint leaves to chew.\"\nOreSeur raised a canine eyebrow. \"And you don't think a dog with\nsweet breath would attract attention?\"\n\"Only from anyone you happen to kiss in the near future,\" Vin said,\nreturning her stacks of paper to her desk.\nOreSeur chuckled softly in his canine way, turning back to study the\ncity.\n\"Is the procession finished yet?\" Vin asked.\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"It is difficult to see, even from a\nheight. But, it does look like Lord Cett has finished moving in.

Lord Ruler—I'm starting to sound like Sazed and Elend. I've\nbeen studying too much lately.\n\"Regardless, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"I'd rather you didn't mention\nthis to your Keeper friends.

Or, at least, that is how I have always\nseen them. Perhaps your Terris prophecies are the same? Expressions of a\nbelief that if the people were in danger, their gods would send a Hero to\nprotect them? In this case, the vagueness would be intentional—and\nrational. The prophecies were never meant to mean someone specific, but\nmore to speak of a general feeling. A general hope.\"\nIf the prophecies weren't specific, why could only she sense the\ndrumming beats?\nStop it, she told herself. You're jumping to conclusions. \"All the\nhumans dead,\" she said. \"How do we die off? The kandra kill us?\"\n\"Of course not,\" OreSeur said. \"We honor our Contract, even in\nreligion.

She'd been forced to\nignore that fact for far too long.\nElend looked deeply into the well. The dark pit—widemouthed to\naccommodate the comings and goings of numerous skaa—seemed a large\nmouth opening up, stone lips spread and preparing to swallow him down.\nElend glanced to the side, where Ham stood speaking with a group of\nhealers.\n\"We first noticed when so many people came to us complaining of\ndiarrhea and abdominal pains,\" the healer said. \"The symptoms were\nunusually strong, my lord. We've. . .already lost several to the malady.\"\nHam glanced at Elend, frowning.\n\"Everyone who grew sick lived in this area,\" the healer continued.\n\"And drew their water from this well or another in the next square.\"\n\"Have you brought this to the attention of Lord Penrod and the\nAssembly?\" Elend asked.\n\"Um, no, my lord. We figured that you. . .\"\nI'm not king anymore, Elend thought. However, he couldn't say the\nwords. Not to this man, looking for help.\n\"I'll take care of it,\" Elend said, sighing. \"You may return to your\npatients.\"\n\"They are filling our clinic, my lord,\" he said.\n\"Then appropriate one of the empty noble mansions,\" Elend said.\n\"There are plenty of those. Ham, send him with some of my guard to help\nmove the sick and prepare the building.\"\nHam nodded, waving over a soldier, telling him to gather twenty on-\nduty men from the palace to meet with the healer. The healer smiled,\nlooking relieved, and bowed to Elend as he left.\nHam walked up, joining Elend beside the well. \"Coincidence?\"\n\"Hardly,\" Elend said, gripping the edge if the well with frustrated\nfingers. \"The question is, which one poisoned it?\"\n\"Cett just came into the city,\" Ham said, rubbing his chin. \"Would have\nbeen easy to send out some soldiers to covertly drop in the poison.\"\n\"Seems more like something my father would do,\" Elend said.\n\"Something to increase our tension, to get back at us for playing him for a\nfool in his camp. Plus, he's got that Mistborn who could have easily placed\nthe poison.\"\nOf course, Cett had had this same thing happen to him—Breeze\npoisoning his water supply back before he reached the city. Elend ground\nhis teeth. There was really no way to know which one was behind the\nattack.\nEither way, the poisoned wells meant trouble. There were others in the\ncity, of course, but they were just as vulnerable. The people might have to\nstart relying on the river for their water, and it was far less healthy, its\nwaters muddy and polluted by waste from both the army camps and the city\nitself.\n\"Set guards around these wells,\" Elend said, waving a hand. \"Board"

At this rate, we'll snap long before winter ends.\nAfter a detour for a late dinner—where some talk about servants\ngetting sick left her concerned—Vin went in and checked on Elend, who\nhad just returned from walking the city with Ham. After that, Vin and\nOreSeur continued their original quest: that of finding Dockson.\nThey located him in the palace library. The room had once been\nStraff's personal study; Elend seemed to find the room's new purpose\namusing for some reason.\nPersonally, Vin didn't find the library's location nearly as amusing as\nits contents. Or, rather, lack thereof. Though the room was lined with\nshelves, nearly all of them showed signs of having been pillaged by Elend.\nThe rows of books lay pocked by forlorn empty spots, their companions\ntaken away one by one, as if Elend were a predator, slowly whittling down\na herd.\nVin smiled. It probably wouldn't be too long before Elend had stolen\nevery book in the small library, carrying the tomes up to his study, then\nforgetfully placing them in one of his piles—ostensibly for return. Still,\nthere were a large number of volumes left—ledgers, books of figures, and\nnotebooks on finances; things that Elend usually found of little interest.\nDockson sat at the library's desk now, writing in a ledger. He noticed\nher arrival, and glanced over with a smile, but then turned back to his\nnotations—apparently not wanting to lose his place. Vin waited for him to\nfinish, OreSeur at her side.\nOf all the members of the crew, Dockson seemed to have changed the\nmost during the last year. She remembered her first impressions of him,\nback in Camon's lair. Dockson had been Kelsier's right-hand man, and the\nmore \"realistic\" of the pair. And yet, there had always been an edge of\nhumor to Dockson—a sense that he enjoyed his role as the straight man. He\nhadn't foiled Kelsier so much as complemented him.\nKelsier was dead. Where did that leave Dockson? He wore a\nnobleman's suit, as he always had—and of all the crewmembers, the suits\nseemed to fit him the best. If he shaved off the half beard, he could pass for\na nobleman—not a rich high courtier, but a lord in early middle age who\nhad lived his entire life trading goods beneath a great house master.\nHe wrote in his ledgers, but he had always done that. He still played\nthe role of the responsible one in the crew. So, what was different? He was\nthe same person, did the same things. He just felt different. The laughter\nwas gone; the quiet enjoyment of the eccentricity in those around him.\nWithout Kelsier, Dockson had somehow changed from temperate to. .\n.boring.\nAnd that was what made her suspicious.\nThis has to be done, she thought, smiling at Dockson as he set down"

Vin wondered with alarm. Would one kandra be able to\nrecognize another in a dog's body? No, that couldn't be. Otherwise OreSeur\ncould find the impostor for her. So, she simply smiled again, patting\nOreSeur's head. \"There is a trainer in the market. He teaches wolfhounds to\nbe protective—to stay with young children and keep them out of danger.\"\nDockson nodded. \"So, any purpose to this visit?\"\nVin shrugged. \"We never chat anymore, Dox.\"\nDockson sat back in his chair. \"This might not be the best time for\nchatting. I have to prepare the royal finances to be taken over by someone\nelse, should the vote go against Elend.\"\nWould a kandra be able to do the ledgers? Vin wondered. Yes.

What's on\nyour mind?\"\n\"Well, do you remember that conversation we had, back before the\nCollapse?\"\nDockson frowned. \"Which one?\"\n\"You know. . .. The one about your childhood.\"\n\"Oh,\" Dockson said, nodding. \"Yes, what about it?\"\n\"Well, do you still think the same way?\"\nDockson paused thoughtfully, fingers slowly tapping on the desktop.\nVin waited, trying not to show her tension. The conversation in question\nhad been between the two of them, and during it, Dockson had first spoken\nto her of how much he'd hated the nobility.\n\"I suppose I don't,\" Dockson said. \"Not anymore. Kell always said that\nyou gave the nobility too much credit, Vin. But you started to change even\nhim there at the end. No, I don't think that noble society needs to be\ncompletely destroyed. They aren't all monsters as once presumed.\"\nVin relaxed. He not only knew the conversation, he knew the details of\nthe tangents they'd discussed. She had been the only one there with him.\nThat had to mean that he wasn't the kandra, right?\n\"This is about Elend, isn't it?\" Dockson asked.\nVin shrugged. \"I suppose.\"\n\"I know that you wish he and I could get along better, Vin. But, all\nthings considered, I think we're doing pretty well. He is a decent man; I can\nacknowledge that. He has some faults as a leader: he lacks boldness, lacks\npresence.\"\nNot like Kelsier.\n\"But,\" Dockson continued, \"I don't want to see him lose his throne. He\nhas treated the skaa fairly, for a nobleman.\""

But. . .well, every time I talk to\nhim, I see Kelsier standing over his shoulder, shaking his head at me. Do\nyou know how long Kell and I dreamed of toppling the Lord Ruler? The\nother crewmembers, they thought Kelsier's plan was a newfound passion—\nsomething that came to him in the Pits. But it was older than that, Vin. Far\nolder.\n\"We always hated the nobility, Kell and I. When we were youths,\nplanning our first jobs, we wanted to be rich—but we also wanted to hurt\nthem. Hurt them for taking from us things they had no right to. My love. .\n.Kelsier's mother. . .. Every coin we stole, every nobleman we left dead in\nan alleyway—this was our way of waging war. Our way of punishing\nthem.\"\nVin sat quietly. It was these kinds of stories, these memories of a\nhaunted past, that had always made her just a little uncomfortable with\nKelsier—and with the person he had been training her to become. It was\nthis sentiment that gave her pause, even when her instincts whispered that\nshe should go and exact retribution on Straff and Cett with knives in the\nnight.\nDockson held some of that same hardness. Kell and Dox weren't evil\nmen, but there was an edge of vengefulness to them. Oppression had\nchanged them in ways that no amount of peace, reformation, or recompense\ncould redeem.\nDockson shook his head. \"And we put one of them on the throne. I\ncan't help but think that Kell would be angry with me for letting Elend rule,\nno matter how good a man he is.\"\n\"Kelsier changed at the end,\" Vin said quietly. \"You said it yourself,\nDox. Did you know that he saved Elend's life?\"\nDockson turned, frowning. \"When?\"\n\"On that last day,\" Vin said. \"During the fight with the Inquisitor. Kell\nprotected Elend, who came looking for me.\"\n\"Must have thought he was one of the prisoners.\"\nVin shook her head. \"He knew who Elend was, and knew that I loved\nhim. In the end, Kelsier was willing to admit that a good man was worth\nprotecting, no matter who his parents were.\"\n\"I find that hard to accept, Vin.\"\n\"Why?\"\nDockson met her eyes. \"Because if I accept that Elend bears no guilt\nfor what his people did to mine, then I must admit to being a monster for\nthe things that I did to them.\"\nVin shivered. In those eyes, she saw the truth behind Dockson's\ntransformation. She saw the death of his laughter. She saw the guilt.

That was almost two years ago.\"\n\"That could have been enough, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"We cannot\nlearn everything about a person, but we try our best to discover items like\nthis—private conversations, secrets, confidential information—so that we\ncan mention them at appropriate times and reinforce our illusion.\"\nVin frowned.\n\"There are. . .other things as well, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"I hesitate\nbecause I do not wish you to imagine your friends in pain.

Absently, she pulled out her bronze earring—her\nmother's earring—and worked it between her fingers, watching it reflect\nlight. It had once been gilded with silver, but that had worn off in most\nplaces.\n\"I hate this,\" she finally whispered.\n\"What, Mistress?\"\n\"This. . .distrust,\" she said. \"I hate being suspicious of my friends.

The man walked briskly,\nmoving toward the side of the palace, where the servants' entrances were.\nAs he passed, she finally saw his face.\nCaptain Demoux? she thought.\nShe sat back, crouching with OreSeur beside a small stack of wooden\nsupply boxes. What did she really know of Demoux? He was one of the\nskaa rebels recruited by Kelsier almost two years before. He'd taken to\ncommand, and had been promoted quickly. He was one of the loyal men\nwho had stayed behind when the rest of the army had followed Yeden to\ntheir doom.\nAfter the Collapse, he'd stayed in with the crew, eventually becoming\nHam's second. He had received no small amount of training from Ham—\nwhich might explain why he'd go out at night without a torch or lantern.\nBut, even so. . ..\nIf I were going to replace someone on the crew, Vin thought, I wouldn't\npick an Allomancer—that would make the impostor too easy to spot.

Someone who is\nalways near important meetings, but someone that others don't really know\nthat well. . ..\nShe felt a small thrill. If the impostor were Demoux, it would mean\nthat one of her good friends hadn't been killed. And it would mean that the\nkandra's master was even smarter than she'd given him credit for being.\nHe rounded the keep, and she followed quietly. However, whatever\nhe'd been doing this night, it was already completed—for he moved in\nthrough one of the entrances on the side of the building, greeting the guards\nposted there to watch.\nVin sat back in the shadows. He'd spoken to the guards, so he hadn't\nsnuck out of the palace. And yet. . .she recognized the stooped posture, the\nnervous movements. He'd been nervous about something.\nThat's him, she thought.

He liked to think up questions and answers,\nbut he didn't have experience studying a text in detail, searching out its\nmeaning and implications.\nElend glanced at Sazed, who sat with a book open on the table before\nhim. The Keeper had at least a dozen volumes stacked around him—\nthough, amusingly, his stacks were neatly arranged, spines pointing the\nsame direction, covers flush. Elend's own stacks were characteristically\nhaphazard, pages of notes sticking out at odd angles.\nIt was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming\none didn't want to move around very much. Ham sat on the floor, a small\npile of books beside him, though he spent most of his time voicing one\nrandom idea or another. Tindwyl had a chair, and did not study. The\nTerriswoman found it perfectly acceptable to train Elend as a king;\nhowever, she refused to research and give suggestions about keeping his\nthrone. This seemed, in her eyes, to cross some unseen line between being\nan educator and a political force.\nGood thing Sazed isn't like that, Elend thought. If he were, the Lord\nRuler might still be in charge. In fact, Vin and I would probably both be\ndead—Sazed was the one who actually rescued her when she was\nimprisoned by the Inquisitors. It wasn't me.\nHe didn't like to think about that event. His bungled attempt at\nrescuing Vin now seemed a metaphor for all he had done wrong in his life.\nHe'd always been well-intentioned, but he'd rarely been able to deliver. That\nwas going to change.\n\"What about this, Your Majesty?\" The one who spoke was the only\nother person in the room, a scholar named Noorden. Elend tried to ignore\nthe intricate tattoos around the man's eyes, indications of Noorden's former\nlife as an obligator. He wore large spectacles to try to hide the tattoos, but\nhe had once been relatively well placed in the Steel Ministry. He could\nrenounce his beliefs, but the tattoos would always remain.\n\"What have you found?\" Elend asked.\n\"Some information on Lord Cett, Your Majesty,\" Noorden said. \"I\nfound it in one of the ledgers you took from the Lord Ruler's palace. It\nseems Cett isn't as indifferent to Luthadel politics as he'd like us to think.\"\nNoorden chuckled to himself at the thought.\nElend had never met a cheerful obligator before. Perhaps that was why"

        "text": "seems Cett isn't as indifferent to Luthadel politics as he'd like us to think.\"\nNoorden chuckled to himself at the thought.\nElend had never met a cheerful obligator before. Perhaps that was why\nNoorden hadn't left the city like most of his kind; he certainly didn't seem to\nfit into their ranks. He was only one of several men that Elend had been\nable to find to act as scribes and bureaucrats in his new kingdom.\nElend scanned Noorden's page. Though the page was filled with\nnumbers rather than words, his scholar's mind easily parsed the information.\nCett had done a lot of trading with Luthadel. Most of his work had been\ndone using lesser houses as fronts. That might have fooled noblemen, but\nnot the obligators, who had to be informed of the terms of any deal.\nNoorden passed the ledger over to Sazed, who scanned the numbers.\n\"So,\" Noorden said, \"Lord Cett wanted to appear unconnected to\nLuthadel—the beard and the attitude only serving to reinforce that\nimpression. Yet, he always had a very quiet hand in things here.\"\nElend nodded. \"Maybe he realized that you can't avoid politics by\npretending you're not part of them. There's no way he would have been able\nto grab as much power as he did without some solid political connections.\"\n\"So, what does this tell us?\" Sazed asked.\n\"That Cett is far more accomplished at the game than he wants people\nto believe,\" Elend said, standing, then stepping over a pile of books as he\nmade his way back to his chair. \"But, I think that much was obvious by the\nway he manipulated me and the Assembly yesterday.\"\nNoorden chuckled. \"You should have seen the way you all looked,\nYour Majesty. When Cett revealed himself, a few of the noble\nAssemblymen actually jumped in their seats! I think the rest of you were\ntoo shocked to—\"\n\"Noorden?\" Elend said.\n\"Yes, Your Majesty?\"\n\"Please focus on the task at hand.\"\n\"Um, yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\"Sazed?\" Elend asked. \"What do you think?\"\nSazed looked up from his book—a codified and annotated version of\nthe city's charter, as written by Elend himself. The Terrisman shook his\nhead. \"You did a very good job with this, I think. I can see very few\nmethods of preventing Lord Cett's appointment, should the Assembly\nchoose him.\"\n\"Too competent for your own good?\" Noorden said.\n\"A problem which, unfortunately, I've rarely had,\" Elend said, sitting\nand rubbing his eyes.\nIs this how Vin feels all the time? he wondered. She got less sleep than\nhe, and she was always moving about, running, fighting, spying. Yet, she\nalways seemed fresh. Elend was beginning to droop after just a couple of\ndays of hard study.\nFocus, he told himself. You have to know your enemies so that you can\nfight them. There has to be a way out of this.\nDockson was still composing letters to the other Assemblymen. Elend\nwanted to meet with those who were willing. Unfortunately, he had a\nfeeling that number would be small. They had voted him out, and now they\nhad been presented with an option that seemed an easy way out of their\nproblems."

They had voted him out, and now they\nhad been presented with an option that seemed an easy way out of their\nproblems.\n\"Your Majesty. . .\" Noorden said slowly. \"Do you think, maybe, that\nwe should just let Cett take the throne? I mean, how bad could he be?\"\nElend stopped. One of the reasons he employed the former obligator\nwas because of Noorden's different view-point. He wasn't a skaa, nor was\nhe a high nobleman. He wasn't a thief. He was just a scholarly little man\nwho had joined the Ministry because it had offered an option other than\nbecoming a merchant.\nTo him, the Lord Ruler's death had been a catastrophe that had\ndestroyed his entire way of life. He wasn't a bad man, but he had no real\nunderstanding of the plight of the skaa.\n\"What do you think of the laws I've made, Noorden?\" Elend asked.\n\"They're brilliant, Your Majesty,\" Noorden said. \"Keen representations\nof the ideals spoken of by old philosophers, along with a strong element of\nmodern realism.\"\n\"Will Cett respect these laws?\" Elend asked.\n\"I don't know. I haven't ever really met the man.\"\n\"What do your instincts tell you?\"\nNoorden hesitated. \"No,\" he finally said. \"He isn't the type of man who\nrules by law. He just does what he wants.\"\n\"He would bring only chaos,\" Elend said. \"Look at the information we\nhave from his homeland and the places he's conquered. They are in turmoil.\nHe's left a patchwork of half alliances and promises—threats of invasion\nacting as the thread that—barely—holds it all together. Giving him rule of\nLuthadel would just set us up for another collapse.\"\nNoorden scratched his cheek, then nodded thoughtfully and turned\nback to his reading.\nI can convince him, Elend thought. If only I could do the same for the\nAssemblymen.\nBut Noorden was a scholar; he thought the way Elend did. Logical\nfacts were enough for him, and a promise of stability was more powerful\nthan one of wealth. The Assembly was a different beast entirely. The\nnoblemen wanted a return to what they'd known before; the merchants saw\nan opportunity to grab the titles they'd always envied; and the skaa were\nsimply worried about a brutal slaughter.\nAnd yet, even those were generalizations. Lord Penrod saw himself as\nthe city's patriarch—the ranking nobleman, the one who needed to bring a\nmeasure of conservative temperance to their problems. Kinaler, one of the\nsteel-workers, was worried that the Central Dominance needed a kinship\nwith the kingdoms around it, and saw an alliance with Cett as the best way\nto protect Luthadel in the long run.\nEach of the twenty-three Assemblymen had their own thoughts, goals,\nand problems. That was what Elend had intended; ideas proliferated in such\nan environment. He just hadn't expected so many of their ideas to contradict\nhis own.\n\"You were right, Ham,\" Elend said, turning.\nHam looked up, raising an eyebrow.\n\"At the beginning of this all, you and the others wanted to make an\nalliance with one of the armies—give them the city in exchange for keeping\nit safe from the other armies.\""

We should have\njust gone with your plan.\"\n\"Your Majesty?\" Sazed asked quietly.\n\"Yes?\"\n\"My apologies, but it is not your duty to do what the people want.\"\nElend blinked. \"You sound like Tindwyl.\"\n\"I have known few people as wise as she, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said,\nglancing at her.\n\"Well, I disagree with both of you,\" Elend said. \"A ruler should only\nlead by the consent of the people he rules.\"\n\"I do not disagree with that, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"Or, at least, I\ndo believe in the theory of it. Regardless, I still do not believe that your\nduty is to do as the people wish. Your duty is to lead as best you can,\nfollowing the dictates of your conscience. You must be true, Your Majesty,\nto the man you wish to become. If that man is not whom the people wish to\nhave lead them, then they will choose someone else.\"\nElend paused. Well, of course. If I shouldn't be an exception to my own\nlaws, I shouldn't be an exception to my own ethics, either. Sazed's words\nwere really just a rephrasing of things Tindwyl had said about trusting\noneself, but Sazed's explanation seemed a better one. A more honest one.\n\"Trying to guess what people wish of you will only lead to chaos, I\nthink,\" Sazed said. \"You cannot please them all, Elend Venture.\"\nThe study's small ventilation window bumped open, and Vin squeezed\nthrough, pulling in a puff of mist behind her. She closed the window, then\nsurveyed the room.\n\"More?\" she asked incredulously. \"You found more books?\"\n\"Of course,\" Elend said.\n\"How many of those things have people written?\" she asked with\nexasperation.\nElend opened his mouth, then paused as he saw the twinkle in her eye.\nFinally, he just sighed. \"You're hopeless,\" he said, turning back to his\nletters.\nHe heard rustling from behind, and a moment later Vin landed on one\nof his stacks of books, somehow managing to balance atop it. Her mistcloak\ntassels hung down around her, smudging the ink on his letter.\nElend sighed.\n\"Oops,\" Vin said, pulling back the mistcloak. \"Sorry.\"\n\"Is it really necessary to leap around like that all the time, Vin?\" Elend\nasked.\nVin jumped down. \"Sorry,\" she repeated, biting her lip. \"Sazed says it's\nbecause Mistborn like to be up high, so we can see everything that's going\non.\"\nElend nodded, continuing the letter. He preferred them to be in his own\nhand, but he'd need to have a scribe rewrite this one. He shook his head. So\nmuch to do. . ..\nVin watched Elend scribble.

Sazed sat reading, as did one of Elend's\nscribes—the obligator. She eyed the man, and he shrank down a little in his\nseat. He knew that she'd never trusted him. Priests shouldn't be cheerful.\nShe was excited to tell Elend what she'd discovered about Demoux,\nbut she hesitated. There were too many people around, and she didn't really\nhave any evidence—just her instincts. So, she held herself back, looking\nover the stacks of books.\nThere was a dull quiet in the room. Tindwyl sat with her eyes slightly\nglazed; she was probably studying some ancient biography in her mind.\nEven Ham was reading, though he flipped from book to book, hopping\ntopics. Vin felt as if she should be studying something, too. She thought of\nthe notes she'd been making about the Deepness and the Hero of Ages, but\ncouldn't bring herself to get them out.\nShe couldn't tell him about Demoux, yet, but there was something else\nshe'd discovered.\n\"Elend,\" she said quietly. \"I have something to tell you.\"\n\"Humm?\"\n\"I heard the servants talking when OreSeur and I got dinner earlier,\"\nVin said. \"Some people they know have been sick lately—a lot of them. I\nthink that someone might be fiddling with our supplies.\"\n\"Yes,\" Elend said, still writing. \"I know. Several wells in the city have\nbeen poisoned.\"\n\"They have?\"\nHe nodded. \"Didn't I tell you when you checked on me earlier? That's\nwhere Ham and I were.\"\n\"You didn't tell me.\"\n\"I thought I did,\" Elend said, frowning.\nVin shook her head.\n\"I apologize,\" he said, leaned up and kissed her, then turned back to his\nscribbling.\nAnd a kiss is supposed to make it all right? she thought sullenly, sitting\nback on a stack of books.\nIt was a silly thing; there was really no reason that Elend should have\ntold her so quickly. And yet, the exchange left her feeling odd. Before, he\nwould have asked her to do something about the problem. Now, he'd\napparently handled it all on his own.\nSazed sighed, closing his tome. \"Your Majesty, I can find no holes. I\nhave read your laws over six times now.\"\nElend nodded. \"I feared as much. The only advantage we could gain\nfrom the law is to misinterpret it intentionally—which I will not do.\"\n\"You are a good man, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"If you had seen a\nhole in the law, you would have fixed it. Even if you hadn't caught the\nflaws, one of us would have, when you asked for our opinions.\"\nHe lets them call him \"Your Majesty,\" Vin thought. He tried to get\nthem to stop that. Why let them use it now?\nOdd, that Elend would finally start to think of himself as king after the\nthrone had been taken from him.\n\"Wait,\" Tindwyl said, eyes unglazing. \"You read over this law before it\nwas ratified, Sazed?\"\nSazed flushed."

Your advice has been well appreciated, but I will not allow\nyou to insult a friend and guest of my household, even if those insults are\nindirect.\"\n\"I apologize, Your Majesty.\"\n\"You will not apologize to me,\" Elend said. \"You will apologize to\nSazed, or you will leave this conference.\"\nTindwyl sat for a moment; then she stood and left the room.

He's changing so quickly. How long has it been since\nTindwyl arrived? Two months? None of the things Elend said were that\ndifferent from what he would have said before—but the way he said them\nwas completely different. He was firm, demanding in a way that implied he\nexpected respect.\nIt's the collapse of his throne, the danger of the armies, Vin thought.\nThe pressures are forcing him to change, to either step up and lead or get\ncrushed. He'd known about the wells. What other things had he discovered,\nand not told her?\n\"Elend?\" Vin asked. \"I've thought more about the Deepness.\"\n\"That's wonderful, Vin,\" Elend said, smiling at her. \"But, I really don't\nhave time right now. . ..\"\nVin nodded, and smiled at him. However, her thoughts were more\ntroubled. He's not uncertain, like he once was. He doesn't have to rely on\npeople as much for support.\nHe doesn't need me anymore.\nIt was a foolish thought. Elend loved her; she knew that. His aptitude\nwouldn't make her less valuable to him. And yet, she couldn't stamp out her\nworries. He'd left her once before, when he'd been trying to juggle the needs\nof his house with his love for her, and the action had nearly crushed her.\nWhat would happen if he abandoned her now?\nHe won't, she told herself. He's a better man than that.\nBut, good men had failed relationships, didn't they? People grew apart\n—particularly people who were so different to begin with. Despite herself\n—despite her self-assurances—she heard a small voice pop up in the back\nof her mind.\nIt was a voice she'd thought banished, a voice she hadn't ever expected\nto hear again."

Elend smiled at her, then turned back to his letters.\nVin pulled open the window and stepped out into the night. Zane stood in\nthe mists, feet barely resting against the stone lip running beneath the\nwindow. He stood at a skewed angle, feet against the wall, body jutting out\ninto the night.\nVin glanced to the side, noting the bit of metal that Zane was Pulling\nagainst to hold himself stationary. Another feat of prowess. He smiled at her\nin the night.\n\"Zane?\" she whispered.\nZane glanced upward, and Vin nodded. A second later, they both\nlanded atop Keep Venture's metal roof.\nVin turned to Zane. \"Where have you been?\"\nHe attacked.\nVin jumped back in surprise as Zane spun forward, a swirling form in\nblack, knives twinkling. She came down with her feet half off the rooftop,\ntense. A spar, then? she thought.\nZane struck, his knife coming dangerously close to her neck as she\ndodged to the side. There was something different about his attacks this\ntime. Something more dangerous.\nVin cursed and pulled out her own daggers, jumping back from\nanother attack. As she moved, Zane sliced through the air, cutting the tip off\none of her mistcloak tassels.\nShe turned to face him. He walked forward, but held no combat\nposture. He seemed confident, yet unconcerned, as if he were strolling up to\nan old friend, not entering a fight.\nAll right then, she thought, jumping forward, swiping with her\ndaggers.\nZane stepped forward casually, turning just slightly to the side, easily\ndodging one knife. He reached out, grabbing her other hand with an\neffortless motion, stopping its blow.\nVin froze. Nobody was that good. Zane looked down at her, eyes dark.\nUnconcerned. Unworried.\nHe was burning atium.\nVin pulled free of his grip, jumping backward. He let her go, watching\nas she fell into a crouch, sweat beading on her brow. She felt a sudden,\nsharp stab of terror—a guttural, primal feeling. She had feared this day\nfrom the moment she'd learned of atium. It was the terror of knowing she\nwas powerless, despite all of her skills and abilities.\nIt was the terror of knowing she was going to die.\nShe turned to jump away, but Zane leaped forward before she even\nbegan to move.

She still didn't believe him about\nElend. He could see that in her eyes.\nWell, proof was coming. She'd soon see. She'd soon understand what\nElend Venture truly thought of her.\nBut I do so now. Let it be known that I, Kwaan, Worldbringer of Terris,\nam a fraud.\n35\nIT FELT LIKE SHE WAS going to a ball again.\nThe beautiful maroon gown would have fit in perfectly at one of the\nparties she had attended during the months before the Collapse. The dress\nwas untraditional, but not unfashionable. The changes simply made the\ndress seem distinctive.\nThe alterations left her freer to move; let her walk more gracefully,\nturn more naturally. That, in turn, made her feel even more beautiful.\nStanding before her mirror, Vin thought of what it might have been like to\nwear the dress to a real ball. To be herself—not Valette, the uncomfortable\ncountry noblewoman. Not even Vin, the skaa thief. To be herself.\nOr, at least, as she could imagine herself. Confident because she\naccepted her place as a Mistborn. Confident because she accepted her place\nas the one who had struck down the Lord Ruler. Confident because she\nknew that the king loved her.\nMaybe I could be both, Vin thought, running her hands down the sides\nof the dress, feeling the soft satin.\n\"You look beautiful, child,\" Tindwyl said.\nVin turned, smiling hesitantly. \"I don't have any jewelry. I gave the last\nof it to Elend to help feed the refugees. It was the wrong color to go with\nthis dress anyway.\"\n\"Many women use jewelry to try and hide their own plainness,\"\nTindwyl said. \"You don't have that need.\"\nThe Terriswoman stood with her usual posture, hands clasped before\nher, rings and earrings sparkling. None of her jewelry, however, had\ngemstones; in fact, most of it was made from simple materials. Iron, copper,\npewter. Feruchemical metals."

He's quite far from that.\"\n\"But—\"\n\"I said he would no longer need my instruction,\" Tindwyl said. \"He is\nlearning that he can rely only so much upon the words of others, and has\nreached the point where he will have to learn more for himself. You would\nbe surprised, child, how much about being a good leader simply comes\nfrom experience.\"\n\"He seems very different to me,\" Vin said quietly.\n\"He is,\" Tindwyl said, walking forward to lay a hand on Vin's shoulder.\n\"He is becoming the man that he always knew he would have to be—he just\ndidn't know the path. Though I am hard on him, I think he would have\nfound his way, even if I hadn't come. A man can only stumble for so long\nbefore he either falls or stands up straight.\"\nVin looked at her mirror self, pretty in its maroon dressings. \"This is\nwhat I have to become. For him.\"\n\"For him,\" Tindwyl agreed. \"And for yourself. This is where you were\nheading, before you got distracted.\"\nVin turned. \"Are you going to come with us tonight?\"\nTindwyl shook her head. \"That is not my place. Now, go meet your\nking.\"\nThis time, Elend did not intend to enter his enemy's lair without a\nproper escort. Two hundred soldiers stood in the courtyard, waiting to\naccompany him to Cett's dinner, and Ham—fully armed—was playing\npersonal bodyguard. Spook would act as Elend's coachman. That only left\nBreeze, who—understandably—was a bit nervous about the idea of going\nto the dinner.\n\"You don't have to come,\" Elend told the portly man as they assembled\nin the Venture courtyard.\n\"I don't?\" Breeze said. \"Well then, I shall remain here. Enjoy the\ndinner!\"\nElend paused, frowning.\nHam clapped Elend on the shoulder. \"You should know better than to\ngive that one any wiggle room, Elend!\"\n\"Well, I meant my words,\" Elend said. \"We could really use a Soother,\nbut he doesn't have to come if he doesn't want to.\"\nBreeze looked relieved.\n\"You don't even feel a bit guilty, do you?\" Ham asked.\n\"Guilty?\" Breeze asked, hand resting on his cane. \"My dear Hammond,\nhave you ever known me to express such a dreary and uninspired emotion?\nBesides, I have a feeling Cett will be more amiable without me around.\"\nHe's probably right, Elend thought as his coach pulled up.\n\"Elend,\" Ham said. \"Don't you think bringing two hundred soldiers\nwith us is. . .well, a little obvious?\""

He'll still have us outnumbered five to one.\"\n\"But you'll have a Mistborn sitting a few seats from him,\" a soft voice\nsaid from behind.\nElend turned, smiling at Vin. \"How can you possibly move so quietly\nin a dress like that?\"\n\"I've been practicing,\" she said, taking his arm.\nThing is, she probably has, he thought, inhaling her perfume,\nimagining Vin creeping through the palace hallways in a massive ball gown.\n\"Well, we should get moving,\" Ham said. He gestured for Vin and\nElend to enter the carriage, and they left Breeze behind on the palace steps.\nAfter a year of passing Keep Hasting in the night, its windows\ndarkened, it felt right to see them glowing again.\n\"You know,\" Elend said from beside her, \"we never did get to attend a\nball together.\"\nVin turned from her contemplation of the approaching keep. Around\nher, the carriage bounced along to the sound of several hundred tromping\nfeet, the evening just beginning to grow dark.\n\"We met up several times at the balls,\" Elend continued, \"but we never\nofficially attended one together. I never got the chance to pick you up in my\ncarriage.\"\n\"Is that really so important?\" Vin asked.\nElend shrugged. \"It's all part of the experience. Or, it was. There was a\ncomfortable formality to it all; the gentleman arriving to accompany the\nlady, then everyone watching you enter and evaluating how you look\ntogether. I did it dozens of times with dozens of women, but never with the\none that would have made the experience special.\"\nVin smiled. \"Do you think we'll ever have balls again?\"\n\"I don't know, Vin. Even if we survive all of this. . .well, could you\ndance while so many people starved?\" He was probably thinking about the\nhundreds of refugees, wearied from their travels, stripped of all food and\nequipment by Straff's soldiers, huddled together in the warehouse Elend had\nfound for them.\nYou danced before, she thought. People starved then, too. But that was\na different time; Elend hadn't been king then. In fact, as she thought about\nit, he had never actually danced at those balls. He had studied and met with\nhis friends, planning how he could make a better place out of the Final\nEmpire.\n\"There has to be a way to have both,\" Vin said. \"Maybe we could\nthrow balls, and ask the nobility who came to donate money to help feed the\npeople.\"\nElend smiled. \"We'd probably spend twice as much on the party as we\ngot in donations.\"\n\"And the money we spent would go to skaa merchants.\"\nElend paused thoughtfully, and Vin smirked to herself.

It was a wonder that Dockson could\npry enough money out of them to keep the city running.\n\"We'll worry about that later,\" Elend said as the Hasting gates opened,\nrevealing a field of soldiers at attention.\nYou can bring your soldiers if you want, the display seemed to say. I've\ngot more. In reality, they were entering a strange allegory of Luthadel itself.\nElend's two hundred were now surrounded by Cett's thousand—which, in\nturn, were surrounded by Luthadel's twenty thousand. The city, of course,\nwas then surrounded by nearly a hundred thousand troops on the outside.\nLayer upon layer of soldiers, all tensely waiting for a fight. Thoughts of\nballs and parties fled her mind.\nCett did not greet them at the door. That duty was performed by a\nsoldier in a simple uniform.\n\"Your soldiers can remain here,\" the man said as they entered the main\nentryway. Once, the large, pillared room had been draped in fine rugs and\nwall hangings, but Elend had taken those to fund his government. Cett,\nobviously, hadn't brought replacements, and that left the inside of the keep\nfeeling austere. Like a battlefront fortress, rather than a mansion.\nElend turned, waving to Demoux, and the captain ordered his men to\nwait indoors. Vin stood for a moment, consciously keeping herself from\nshooting a glare at Demoux. If he was the kandra, as her instincts warned,\nthen it was dangerous to have him too close. Part of her itched to simply\nthrow him in a dungeon.\nAnd yet, a kandra couldn't hurt humans, so he wasn't a direct threat. He\nwas simply there to relay information. Plus, he'd already know their most\nsensitive secrets; there was little point in striking now, playing her hand so\nquickly. If she waited, saw where he went when he slipped out of the city,\nthen maybe she could find out which army—or sect in the city—he was\nreporting to. Learn what information he had betrayed.\nAnd so, she stayed her hand, waiting. The time to strike would come.\nHam and Demoux arranged their men, and then a smaller honor guard\n—including Ham, Spook, and Demoux—gathered to stay with Vin and\nElend. Elend nodded to Cett's man, and the soldier led them down a side\npassageway.\nWe're not heading toward the lifts, Vin thought. The Hasting ballroom\nwas at the very top of the keep's central tower; the times she had attended\nballs in the structure, she had been taken to the top on one of four human-\ndrawn lifts. Either Hasting didn't want to waste the manpower, or. . .\nHe picked the tallest keep in the city, Vin thought. The one with the\nfewest windows as well. If Cett pulled all the lifts to the top, it would be\nvery difficult for an invading force to claim the keep.\nFortunately, it didn't appear that they would have to go all the way to\nthe top this evening.

After they climbed two flights in a twisting stone\nstairwell—Vin having to pull her dress in at the sides to keep from brushing\nagainst the stones—their guide led them out into a large, circular room with\nstained-glass windows running around the entire perimeter, broken only by\ncolumns to support the ceiling. The single room was nearly as wide around\nas the tower itself.\nA secondary ballroom, perhaps? Vin wondered, taking in the beauty.\nThe glass wasn't lit, though she suspected that there were clefts for\nlimelights on the outside. Cett didn't appear to care about such things. He\nhad set up a large table in the very center of the room, and sat at its head.\nHe was already eating.\n\"You're late,\" he called out to Elend, \"so I started without you.\"\nElend frowned. To this, Cett laughed a full bellow, holding up a\ndrumstick. \"You seem more aghast at my breach of etiquette than you do\nabout the fact that I brought an army to conquer you, boy! But, I suppose\nthat's Luthadel. Sit down before I eat this all myself.\"\nElend held out an arm for Vin, leading her to the table. Spook took up\nposition near the stairwell, his Tineye's ears listening for danger. Ham led\ntheir ten men to a position from which they could watch the only entrances\nto the room—the entry from the stairs and the door the serving staff used.\nCett ignored the soldiers. He had a group of his own bodyguards\nstanding near the wall on the other side of the room, but he seemed\nunconcerned that Ham's troop had them slightly outnumbered. His son—the\nyoung man who had attended him at the Assembly meeting—stood at his\nside, waiting quietly.\nOne of the two has to be Mistborn, Vin thought. And I still think it is\nCett.\nElend seated her, then took a chair next to her, both of them sitting\ndirectly across from Cett. He barely paused in his eating as the servers\nbrought Vin's and Elend's dishes.\nDrumsticks, Vin thought, and vegetables in gravy. He wants this to be\na messy meal—he wants to make Elend uncomfortable.\nElend didn't start on his food immediately. He sat, watching Cett, his\nexpression thoughtful.\n\"Damn,\" Cett said. \"This is good food. You have no idea how hard it is\nto get proper meals when traveling!\"\n\"Why did you want to speak with me?\" Elend asked. \"You know I\nwon't be convinced to vote for you.\"\nCett shrugged. \"I thought it might be interesting.\"\n\"Is this about your daughter?\" Elend asked.\n\"Lord Ruler, no!\" Cett said with a laugh. \"Keep the silly thing, if you\nwant. The day she ran off was one of the few joys I've had this last month.\"\n\"And if I threaten to harm her?\" Elend asked.\n\"You won't,\" Cett said.\n\"You're certain?\"\nCett smiled through his thick beard, leaning toward Elend. \"I know\nyou, Venture. I'd been watching you, studying you, for months. And then,\nyou were kind enough to send one of your friends to spy on me. I learned a\nlot about you from him!\"\nElend looked troubled."

You Luthadel noblemen must assume that\neveryone outside the city is a damn fool!\"\n\"And yet, you listened to Breeze,\" Elend said. \"You let him join you,\nlistened to his advice. And then, you only chased him away when you found\nhim being intimate with your daughter—the one you claim to have no\naffection for.\"\n\"Is that why he told you he left the camp?\" Cett asked, laughing.\n\"Because I caught him with Allrianne? Goodness, what do I care if the girl\nseduced him?\"\n\"You think she seduced him?\" Vin asked.\n\"Of course,\" Cett said. \"Honestly, I only spent a few weeks with him,\nand even I know how useless he is with women.\"\nElend was taking all this in stride. He watched Cett with narrow,\ndiscerning eyes. \"So why did you chase him away?\"\nCett leaned back. \"I tried to turn him. He refused. I figured killing him\nwould be preferable to letting him return to you. But, he's remarkably agile\nfor a man his size.\"\nIf Cett really is Mistborn, there's no way Breeze got away without Cett\nletting him, Vin thought.\n\"So you see, Venture,\" Cett said. \"I know you. I know you better,\nperhaps, than you know yourself—for I know what your friends think of\nyou. It takes a pretty extraordinary man to earn the loyalty of a weasel like\nBreeze.\"\n\"So you think I won't harm your daughter,\" Elend said.\n\"I know you won't,\" Cett said. \"You're honest—I happen to like that\nabout you. Unfortunately, honesty is very easy to exploit—I knew, for\ninstance, that you'd admit Breeze was Soothing that crowd.\" Cett shook his\nhead. \"Honest men weren't meant to be kings, lad. It's a damn shame, but\nit's true. That's why I have to take the throne from you.\"\nElend was silent for a moment. Finally, he looked to Vin. She took his\nplate, sniffing it with an Allomancer's senses.\nCett laughed. \"Think I'd poison you?\"\n\"No, actually,\" Elend said as Vin set the plate down. She wasn't as\ngood as some, but she'd leaned the obvious scents.\n\"You wouldn't use poison,\" Elend said. \"That isn't your way. You seem\nto be a rather honest man yourself.\"\n\"I'm just blunt,\" Cett said. \"There's a difference.\"\n\"I haven't heard you tell a lie yet.\"\n\"That's because you don't know me well enough to discern the lies,\"\nCett said. He held up several grease-stained fingers. \"I've already told you\nthree lies tonight, lad. Good luck guessing which ones they were.\"\nElend paused, studying Cett. \"You're playing with me.\"\n\"Of course I am!\" Cett said. \"Don't you see, boy? This is why you\nshouldn't be king.

At least I swear to your face.\"\nElend still hadn't touched his food. \"What will happen if you win the\nvote for the throne?\"\nCett shrugged. \"Honest answer?\"\n\"Always.\"\n\"First thing, I'd have you assassinated,\" Cett said. \"Can't have old\nkings sticking around.\"\n\"And if I step down?\" Elend said. \"Withdraw from the vote?\"\n\"Step down,\" Cett said, \"vote for me, and then leave town, and I'll let\nyou live.\"\n\"And the Assembly?\" Elend asked.\n\"Dissolved,\" Cett said. \"They're a liability. Any time you give a\ncommittee power, you just end up with confusion.\"\n\"The Assembly gives the people power,\" Elend said. \"That's what a\ngovernment should provide.\"\nSurprisingly, Cett didn't laugh at that comment. Instead, he leaned in\nagain, setting one arm on the table, discarding a half-eaten drumstick.\n\"That's the thing, boy. Letting the people rule themselves is fine when\neverything is bright and happy, but what about when you have two armies\nfacing you? What about when there's a band of insane koloss destroying\nvillages on your frontier? Those aren't the times when you can afford to\nhave an Assembly around to depose you.\" Cett shook his head. \"The price is\ntoo high. When you can't have both freedom and safety, boy, which do you\nchoose?\"\nElend was silent. \"I make my own choice,\" he finally said. \"And I\nleave the others to make their own as well.\"\nCett smiled, as if he'd expected such a reply. He started in on another\ndrumstick.\n\"Let's say I leave,\" Elend said. \"And let's say you do get the throne,\nprotect the city, and dissolve the Assembly. What then? What of the\npeople?\"\n\"Why do you care?\"\n\"You need ask?\" Elend said. \"I thought you 'understood' me.\"\nCett smiled. \"I put the skaa back to work, in the way the Lord Ruler\ndid.

Vin\njust picked quietly at her food. As she did, however, she studied the faces of\nCett's soldiers and servants. There were bound to be Allomancers mixed\namong them—finding out how many could give Elend an advantage.\n\"Your people are starving,\" Cett said. \"And, if my spies are worth their\ncoin, you just got another influx of mouths. You can't last much longer\nunder this siege.\"\n\"And?\" Elend asked.\n\"I have food,\" Cett said. \"A lot of it—more than my army needs.\nCanned goods, packed with the new method the Lord Ruler developed.\nLong-lasting, no spoilage.

Elend ate, but Vin only mixed her food around. If\nshe had missed a poison, she wanted one of them to remain alert. She still\nwanted to find those Allomancers, and there was only one way to be certain.\nShe turned off her copper, then burned bronze.\nThere was no Coppercloud burning; Cett apparently didn't care if\nsomeone recognized his men as Allomancers. Two of his men were burning\npewter. Neither, however, were soldiers; both were pretending to be\nmembers of the serving staff who were bringing meals. There was also a\nTineye pulsing in the other room, listening.\nWhy hide Thugs as servants, then use no copper to hide their pulses?\nIn addition, there were no Soothers or Rioters. Nobody was trying to\ninfluence Elend's emotions. Neither Cett nor his youthful attendant were\nburning any metals. Either they weren't actually Allomancers, or they feared\nexposing themselves. Just to be certain, Vin flared her bronze, seeking to\npierce any hidden copperclouds that might be nearby. She could see Cett\nputting out some obvious Allomancers as a distraction, then hiding the\nothers inside a cloud.\nShe found nothing. Finally satisfied, she returned to picking at her\nmeal. How many times has this ability of mine—the ability to pierce\ncopperclouds—proven useful? She'd forgotten what it was like to be\nblocked from sensing Allomantic pulses. This one little ability—simple\nthough it seemed—provided an enormous advantage. And the Lord Ruler\nand his Inquisitors had probably been able to do it from the beginning.\nWhat other tricks was she missing, what other secrets had died with the\nLord Ruler?\nHe knew the truth about the Deepness, Vin thought. He must have. He\ntried to warn us, at the end. . ..\nElend and Cett were talking again.

In their\nplace, a desperate, beaten people huddled in what blankets they could find.\nThere were very few men, none of fighting quality; Straff had pressed those\ninto his army. These others—the weak, the sickly, the wounded—he had\nallowed to Luthadel, knowing that Elend wouldn't turn them away.\nSazed moved among them, offering what comfort he could. They had\nno furniture, and even changes of clothing were becoming scarce in the city.\nThe merchants, realizing that warmth would be a premium for the\nupcoming winter, had begun raising prices on all their wares, not just\nfoodstuffs.\nSazed knelt beside a crying woman. \"Peace, Genedere,\" he said, his\ncoppermind reminding him of her name.\nShe shook her head. She had lost three children in the koloss attack,\ntwo more in the flight to Luthadel. Now the final one—the babe she had\ncarried the entire way—was sick. Sazed took the child from her arms,\ncarefully studying his symptoms. Little had changed from the day before.\n\"Is there hope, Master Terrisman?\" Genedere asked.\nSazed glanced down at the thin, glassy-eyed baby. The chances were\nnot good. How could he tell her such a thing?\n\"As long as he breathes, there is hope, dear woman,\" Sazed said. \"I\nwill ask the king to increase your portion of food—you need strength to\ngive suck. You must keep him warm. Stay near the fires, and use a damp\ncloth to drip water in his mouth even when he is not eating. He has great\nneed of liquids.\"\nGenedere nodded dully, taking back the baby. How Sazed wished he\ncould give her more. A dozen different religions passed through his mind.\nHe had spent his entire life trying to encourage people to believe in"

A dozen different religions passed through his mind.\nHe had spent his entire life trying to encourage people to believe in\nsomething other than the Lord Ruler. Yet, for some reason, at this moment\nhe found it difficult to preach one of them to Genedere.\nIt had been different before the Collapse. Each time he'd spoken of a\nreligion, Sazed had felt a subtle sense of rebellion. Even if people hadn't\naccepted the things he taught—and they rarely had—his words had\nreminded them that there had once been beliefs other than the doctrines of\nthe Steel Ministry.\nNow there was nothing to rebel against. In the face of the terrible grief\nhe saw in Genedere's eyes, he found it difficult to speak of religions long\ndead, gods long forgotten. Esoterica would not ease this woman's pain.\nSazed stood, moving on to the next group of people.\n\"Sazed?\"\nSazed turned. He hadn't noticed Tindwyl entering the warehouse. The\ndoors of the large structure were closed against approaching night, and the\nfirepits gave an inconsistent light. Holes had been knocked in the roof to let\nout the smoke; if one looked up, trails of mist could be seen creeping into\nthe room, though they evaporated before they reached halfway to the floor.\nThe refugees didn't often look up.\n\"You've been here nearly all day,\" Tindwyl said. The room was\nremarkably quiet, considering its occupancy. Fires crackled, and people lay\nsilent in their pain or numbness.\n\"There are many wounded here,\" Sazed said. \"I am the best one to look\nafter them, I think. I am not alone—the king has sent others and Lord\nBreeze is here, Soothing the people's despair.\"\nSazed nodded to the side, where Breeze sat in a chair, ostensibly\nreading a book. He looked terribly out of place in the room, wearing his fine\nthree-piece suit. Yet, his mere presence said something remarkable, in\nSazed's estimation.\nThese poor people, Sazed thought. Their lives were terrible under the\nLord Ruler. Now even what little they had has been taken from them. And\nthey were only a tiny number—four hundred compared with the hundreds\nof thousands who still lived in Luthadel.\nWhat would happen when the final stores of food ran out? Rumors\nwere already abroad regarding the poisoned wells, and Sazed had just heard\nthat some of their stored food had been sabotaged as well. What would\nhappen to these people? How long could the siege continue?\nIn fact, what would happen when the siege ended? What would happen\nwhen the armies finally began to attack and pillage? What destruction, what\ngrief, would the soldiers cause in searching for hidden atium?\n\"You do care for them,\" Tindwyl said quietly, stepping up.\nSazed turned toward her. Then he looked down. \"Not as much as I\nshould, perhaps.\"\n\"No,\" Tindwyl said. \"I can see it. You confuse me, Sazed.\"\n\"I seem to have a talent in that area.\"\n\"You look tired. Where is your bronzemind?\"\nSuddenly, Sazed felt the fatigue. He'd been ignoring it, but her words\nseemed to bring it in like a wave, rolling over him."

He'd been ignoring it, but her words\nseemed to bring it in like a wave, rolling over him.\nHe sighed. \"I used most of my wakefulness in my run to Luthadel. I\nwas so eager to get here. . ..\" His studies had languished recently. With the\nproblems in the city, and the arrival of the refugees, he hadn't had much\ntime. Besides, he had already transcribed the rubbing. Further work would\nrequire detailed cross-referencing to other works, searching for clues. He\nprobably wouldn't even have time to. . .\nHe frowned, noting the odd look in Tindwyl's eyes.\n\"All right,\" she said, sighing. \"Show me.\"\n\"Show you?\"\n\"Whatever it was you found,\" she said. \"The discovery that prompted\nyou to run across two dominances. Show it to me.\"\nSuddenly, everything seemed to lighten. His fatigue, his worry, even\nhis sorrow. \"I would love to,\" he said quietly.\nAnother job well done, Breeze thought, congratulating himself as he\nwatched the two Terrismen leave the warehouse.\nMost people, even noblemen, misunderstood Soothing. They thought\nof it as some kind of mind control, and even those who knew more\npresumed that Soothing was an invasive, terrible thing.\nBreeze had never seen it that way. Soothing wasn't invasive. If it was,\nthen ordinary interaction with another person was comparably invasive.\nSoothing, when done right, was no more a violation of another person than\nit was for a woman to wear a low-cut gown or speak in a commanding\nvoice. All three produced common, understandable, and—most important—\nnatural reactions in people.\nTake Sazed, for example. Was it \"invasive\" to make the man less\nfatigued, so he could better go about his ministrations? Was it wrong to\nSoothe away his pain—just a bit—thereby making him better able to cope\nwith the suffering?\nTindwyl was an even better example. Perhaps some would call Breeze\na meddler for Soothing her sense of responsibility, and her disappointment,\nwhen she saw Sazed. But, Breeze had not created the emotions that the\ndisappointment had been overshadowing. Emotions like curiosity. Respect.\nLove.\nNo, if Soothing were simple \"mind control,\" Tindwyl would have\nturned away from Sazed as soon as the two left Breeze's area of influence.\nBut Breeze knew that she wouldn't. A crucial decision had been made, and\nBreeze had not made that decision for her. The moment had been building\nfor weeks; it would have occurred with or without Breeze.\nHe had just helped it happen sooner.\nSmiling to himself, Breeze checked his pocket watch. He still had a\nfew more minutes, and he settled back in his chair, sending out a general\nSoothing wave, lessening people's grief and pain. Focusing on so many at\nonce, he couldn't be very specific; some would find themselves made a little\nemotionally numb as he Pushed too strongly against them.

But, it would be\ngood for the group as a whole.\nHe didn't read his book; in truth, he couldn't understand how Elend and\nthe rest spent so much time with them. Dreadfully boring things. Breeze\ncould only see himself reading if there were no people around. Instead, he\nwent back to what he'd been doing before Sazed had drawn his attention.\nHe studied the refugees, trying to decide what each one was feeling.\nThis was the other great misunderstanding about Soothing. Allomancy\nwasn't nearly as important as observational talent. True, having a subtle\ntouch certainly helped. However, Soothing didn't give an Allomancer the\nability to know someone's feelings. Those, Breeze had to guess on his own.\nIt all came back to what was natural. Even the most inexperienced skaa\nwould realize they were being Soothed if unexpected emotions began\nbouncing around inside of them. True subtlety in Soothing was about\nencouraging natural emotions, all done by carefully making the right other\nemotions less powerful. People were a patchwork of feelings; usually, what\nthey thought they were \"feeling\" at the moment only related to which\nemotions were currently most dominant within them.\nThe careful Soother saw what was beneath the surface. He understood\nwhat a man was feeling, even when that man himself didn't understand—or\nacknowledge—those emotions. Such was the case with Sazed and Tindwyl.\nOdd pair, that one, Breeze thought to himself, idly Soothing one of the\nskaa to make him more relaxed as he tried to sleep. The rest of the crew is\nconvinced that those two are enemies. But, hatred rarely creates that\nmeasure of bitterness and frustration. No, those two emotions come from an\nentirely different set of problems.\nOf course, isn't Sazed supposed to be a eunuch? I wonder how this all\ncame about. . ..\nHis speculations trailed off as the warehouse doors opened. Elend\nwalked in—Ham, unfortunately, accompanying him. Elend was wearing\none of his white uniforms, complete with white gloves and a sword. The\nwhite was an important symbol; with all of the ash and soot in the city, a\nman in white was quite striking. Elend's uniforms had to been crafted of\nspecial fabrics designed to be resistant to ash, and they still had to be\nscrubbed every day. The effect was worth the effort.\nBreeze immediately picked at Elend's emotions, making the man less\ntired, less uncertain—though the second was becoming almost unnecessary.\nThat was partially the Terriswoman's doing; Breeze had been impressed\nwith her ability to change how people felt, considering her lack of\nAllomancy.\nBreeze left Elend's emotions of disgust and pity; both were appropriate\nconsidering the environment. He did, however, give Ham a nudge to make\nhim less argumentative; Breeze wasn't in a mood to deal with the man's\nprattlings at the moment.\nHe stood as the two men approached. People perked up as they saw\nElend, his presence somehow bringing them a hope that Breeze couldn't\nemulate with Allomancy. They whispered, calling Elend King.\n\"Breeze,\" Elend said, nodding. \"Is Sazed here?\""

I can understand food's expense,\nconsidering its scarcity. However, there is no reason but greed to deny the\npeople clothing.\"\nHam nodded, but Breeze could see the reticence in his posture. Did the\nothers realize how strangely nonconfrontational Ham was? He liked to\nargue with friends, but he rarely actually came to any conclusions in his\nphilosophizing. Plus, he absolutely hated fighting with strangers; Breeze\nhad always found that an odd attribute in one who was hired, essentially, to\nhit people. He gave Ham a bit of a Soothing to make him less worried about\nconfronting the merchants.\n\"You aren't going to stay here all night, are you, Breeze?\" Elend asked.\n\"Lord Ruler, no!\" Breeze said. \"My dear man, you're lucky you\nmanaged to get me to come at all. Honestly, this is no place for a\ngentleman. The dirt, the depressing atmosphere—and that's not even\nmaking mention of the smell!\"\nHam frowned. \"Breeze, someday you're going to have to learn to think\nabout other people.\"\n\"As long as I can think about them from a distance, Hammond, I shall\nbe happy to engage in the activity.\"\nHam shook his head. \"You're hopeless.\"\n\"Are you heading back to the palace then?\" Elend asked.\n\"Yes, actually,\" Breeze said, checking his pocket watch.\n\"Do you need a ride?\"\n\"I brought my own carriage,\" Breeze said.\nElend nodded, then turned to Ham, and the two retreated the way they\nhad come, talking about Elend's next meeting with one of the other\nAssemblymen.\nBreeze wandered into the palace a short time later. He nodded to the\ndoor guards, Soothing away their mental fatigue. They perked up in\nresponse, watching the mists with renewed vigilance. It wouldn't last long,\nbut little touches like that were second nature to Breeze.\nIt was getting late, and few people were in the hallways. He made his\nway through the kitchens, Nudging the scullery maids to make them more\nchatty. It would make their cleaning pass more quickly. Beyond the kitchens\nhe found a small stone room, lit by a couple of plain lamps, set with a small\ntable. It was one of the palace's boothlike, solitary dining rooms.\nClubs sat in one corner of the booth, gimped leg stretched out on the\nbench. He eyed Breeze with a scowl. \"You're late.\"\n\"You're early,\" Breeze said, sliding into the bench across from Clubs.\n\"Same thing,\" Clubs grumbled."

He eyed Breeze with a scowl. \"You're late.\"\n\"You're early,\" Breeze said, sliding into the bench across from Clubs.\n\"Same thing,\" Clubs grumbled.\nThere was a second cup on the table, along with a bottle of wine.\nBreeze unbuttoned his vest, sighed quietly, and poured himself a cup as he\nleaned back with his legs up on his bench.\nClubs sipped his wine.\n\"You have your cloud up?\" Breeze asked.\n\"Around you?\" Clubs said. \"Always.\"\nBreeze smiled, taking a sip, and relaxed. Though he rarely had\nopportunities to use his powers anymore, Clubs was a Smoker. When he\nwas burning copper, every Allomancer's abilities were invisible to those\nburning bronze. But more important—at least to Breeze—burning copper\nmade Clubs immune to any form of emotional Allomancy.\n\"Don't see why that makes you so happy,\" Clubs said. \"I thought you\nliked playing with emotions.\"\n\"I do,\" Breeze said.\n\"Then why come drink with me every night?\" Clubs asked.\n\"You mind the company?\"\nClubs didn't answer. That was pretty much his way of saying he didn't\nmind. Breeze eyed the grumpy general. Most of the other crewmembers\nstayed away from Clubs; Kelsier had brought him in at the last moment,\nsince the Coppercloud they usually used had died.\n\"Do you know what it's like, Clubs?\" Breeze asked. \"Being a\nSoother?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"It gives you remarkable control. It's a wonderful feeling, being able to\ninfluence those around you, always feeling like you have a handle on how\npeople will react.\"\n\"Sounds delightful,\" Clubs said flatly.\n\"And yet, it does things to you. I spend most of my time watching\npeople—tweaking, Nudging, and Soothing. That's changed me. I don't. .\n.look at people the same way. It's hard to just be friends with someone when\nyou see them as something to be influenced and changed.\"\nClubs grunted. \"So that's why we never used to see you with women.\"\nBreeze nodded. \"I can't help it anymore. I always touch the emotions\nof everyone around me. And so, when a woman comes to love me. . .\" He\nliked to think he wasn't invasive. Yet, how could he trust anyone who said\nthey loved him? Was it he, or his Allomancy, that they responded to?\nClubs filled his cup. \"You're a lot sillier than you act.\"\nBreeze smiled. Clubs was one of the few people who was completely\nimmune to his touch. Emotional Allomancy wouldn't work on him, and he\nwas always completely forthcoming with his emotions: everything made\nhim grumpy. Manipulating him through non-Allomantic means had proven\nto be a fruitless waste of time.\nBreeze regarded his wine. \"The amusing thing is, you almost didn't\njoin the crew because of me.\"\n\"Damn Soothers,\" Clubs muttered.\n\"But you're immune to us.\"\n\"To your Allomancy, maybe,\" Clubs said. \"But that isn't the only way\nyou people do things.

Finally, Clubs muttered, \"You're not as bad as most.\"\nBreeze took a gulp of wine. \"That is as honest a compliment as I think\nI've ever received.\"\n\"Don't let it ruin you,\" Clubs said.\n\"Oh, I think I'm too late for ruining,\" Breeze said, topping off his cup.\n\"This crew. . .Kell's plan. . .has already done a thorough job of that.\"\nClubs nodded in agreement.\n\"What happened to us, Clubs?\" Breeze asked. \"I joined Kell for the\nchallenge. I never did know why you joined.\"\n\"Money.\"\nBreeze nodded. \"His plan fell apart, his army got destroyed, and we\nstayed. Then he died, and we still stayed. This blasted kingdom of Elend's is\ndoomed, you know.\"\n\"We won't last another month,\" Clubs said. It wasn't idle pessimism;\nBreeze knew people well enough to tell when they were serious.\n\"And yet, here we are,\" Breeze said. \"I spent all day making skaa feel\nbetter about the fact that their families had been slaughtered. You spent all\nday training soldiers that—with or without your help—will barely last a few\nheartbeats against a determined foe. We follow a boy of a king who doesn't\nseem to have a shade of a clue just how bad his predicament is. Why?\"\nClubs shook his head. \"Kelsier. Gave us a city, made us think we were\nresponsible for protecting it.\"\n\"But we aren't that kind of people,\" Breeze said. \"We're thieves and\nscammers. We shouldn't care. I mean. . .I've gotten so bad that I Soothe\nscullery maids so that they'll have a happier time at work! I might as well\nstart dressing in pink and carrying around flowers. I could probably make\nquite a bundle at weddings.\"\nClubs snorted. Then he raised his cup. \"To the Survivor,\" he said.\n\"May he be damned for knowing us better than we knew ourselves.\"\nBreeze raised his own cup. \"Damn him,\" he agreed quietly.\nThe two fell silent. Talking to Clubs tended to turn into. . .well, not\ntalking. However, Breeze felt a simple contentment. Soothing was\nwonderful; it made him who he was. But it was also work. Even birds\ncouldn't fly all the time.\n\"There you are.\"\nBreeze snapped his eyes open. Allrianne stood at the entrance to the\nroom, just at the edge of the table. She wore light blue; where had she\ngotten so many dresses? Her makeup was, of course, immaculate—and\nthere was a bow in her hair. That long blond hair—common in the West but\nalmost unheard of in the Central Dominance—and that perky, inviting\nfigure.\nDesire immediately blossomed inside of him. No! Breeze thought.\nShe's half your age. You're a dirty old man. Dirty! \"Allrianne,\" he said"

I'm eighteen, not ten.\"\nYou might as well be, he thought, looking away from her, trying to\nfocus on something else. He knew that he should be stronger, shouldn't let\nthe girl get near him, but he did nothing as she slid up to him and took a\ndrink from his cup.\nHe sighed, putting his arm around her shoulders. Clubs just shook his\nhead, the hint of a smile on his lips.\n\"Well,\" Vin said quietly, \"that answers one question.\"\n\"Mistress?\" OreSeur said, sitting across the table from her in the dark\nroom. With her Allomancer's ears, she could hear exactly what was going\non in the next boothlike room over.\n\"Allrianne is an Allomancer,\" Vin said.\n\"Really?\"\nVin nodded. \"She's been Rioting Breeze's emotions ever since she\narrived, making him more attracted to her.\"\n\"One would think that he'd notice,\" OreSeur said.\n\"You'd think,\" Vin said. She probably shouldn't feel as amused as she\ndid. The girl could be a Mistborn—though the idea of that puff flying\nthrough the mists seemed ridiculous.\nWhich is probably exactly how she wants me to think, Vin thought. I\nhave to remember Kliss and Shan—neither one of them turned out to be the\nperson I thought they were.\n\"Breeze probably just doesn't think his emotions are unnatural,\" Vin\nsaid. \"He must be attracted to her already.\"\nOreSeur closed his mouth and cocked his head—his dog's version of a\nfrown.\n\"I know,\" Vin agreed. \"But, at least we know he isn't the one using\nAllomancy to seduce her. Either way, that's irrelevant. Clubs isn't the\nkandra.\"\n\"How could you possibly know that, Mistress?\"\nVin paused. Clubs always turned his copper on around Breeze; it was\none of the few times he used it. However, it was difficult to tell if someone\nwas burning copper. After all, if they turned on their metal, they hid\nthemselves by default.\nBut Vin could pierce copperclouds. She could sense Allrianne's\nRioting; she could even sense a faint thumping coming from Clubs himself,\ncopper's own Allomantic pulse, something that Vin suspected few people\nbeyond herself and the Lord Ruler had ever heard.\n\"I just know,\" Vin said.\n\"If you say so, Mistress,\" OreSeur said. \"But. . .didn't you already\ndecide the spy was Demoux?\"\n\"I wanted to check Clubs anyway,\" she said. \"Before I did anything\ndrastic.\"\n\"Drastic?\"\nVin sat quietly for a moment.

I should have told Ham straight off, she thought with\nfrustration.\n\"My lady, he only left a few minutes ago,\" the servant said.\nVin glanced at OreSeur, then took off down the corridor. As soon as\nthey reached a window, Vin leaped out into the dark night, OreSeur\nfollowing behind her, dropping the short distance to the courtyard.\nLast time, I saw him come back in through the gates to the palace\ngrounds, she thought, running through the mist. She found a couple of\nsoldiers there, guarding.\n\"Did Captain Demoux come this way?\" she demanded, bursting into\ntheir ring of torchlight.\nThey perked up, at first shocked, then confused.\n\"Lady Heir?\" one of them said. \"Yes, he just went out, on patrol just a\nminute or two ago.\"\n\"By himself?\" Vin asked.\nThey nodded.\n\"Isn't that a little odd?\"\nThey shrugged. \"He goes by himself sometimes,\" one said. \"We don't\nquestion.

I\nshould have—\nShe froze. Up ahead, walking down a quite street in the mists, was a\nfigure, walking into the city. Demoux.\nVin dropped a coin and threw herself into the air, passing far over his\nhead, landing on top of a building. He continued, oblivious. Demoux or\nkandra, neither would have Allomantic powers.\nVin paused, daggers out, ready to spring. But. . .she still didn't have\nany real proof. The part of her that Kelsier had transformed, the part that\nhad come to trust, thought of the Demoux she knew.\nDo I really believe he's the kandra? she thought. Or do I just want him\nto be the kandra, so that I don't have to suspect my real friends?\nHe continued to walk below, her tin-enhanced ears easily picking out\nhis footfalls. Behind, OreSeur scrambled up onto the top of the roof, then\npadded over and sat down beside her.\nI can't just attack, she thought. I need to at least watch, see where he's\ngoing. Get proof.

Vin glanced at Demoux, trailing him with her eyes as he\nwandered down an alleyway, moving toward the illumination.\nWhat. . .?\nVin threw herself off the roof. It took only three bounds for her to\nreach the source of the light. A modest bonfire crackled in the center of a\nsmall square. Skaa huddled around it for warmth, looking a little frightened\nin the mists. Vin was surprised to see them. She hadn't seen skaa go out in\nthe mists since the night of the Collapse.\nDemoux approached down a side street, greeting several of the others.\nIn the firelight she could confirm for certain that it was him—or, at least, a\nkandra with his face.\nThere were, perhaps, two hundred people in the square. Demoux\nmoved as if to sit on the cobblestones, but someone quickly approached\nwith a chair. A young woman brought him a mug of something steaming,\nwhich he received gratefully.\nVin leaped to a rooftop, staying low to keep from being exposed by the\nfirelight.

He glanced down at the street below, shook his head,\nthen padded over to join her. She raised a finger to her lips, nodding down\nat the growing group of people. OreSeur cocked his head at the sight, but\nsaid nothing.\nFinally, Demoux stood, holding the still steaming cup in his hands.\nPeople gathered around, sitting on the cold cobblestones, huddled beneath\nblankets or cloaks.\n\"We shouldn't fear the mists, my friends,\" Demoux said. His wasn't the\nvoice of a strong leader or forceful battle commander—it was the voice of\nhardened youth, a little hesitant, but compelling nonetheless.\n\"The Survivor taught us of this,\" he continued. \"I know it's very hard\nto think of the mists without remembering stories of mistwraiths or other\nhorrors. But, the Survivor gave the mists to us. We should try and remember\nhim, through them.\"\nLord Ruler. . .Vin thought with shock. He's one of them—a member of\nthe Church of the Survivor! She wavered, uncertain what to think. Was he\nthe kandra or wasn't he? Why would the kandra meet with a group of\npeople like this? But. . .why would Demoux himself do it?\n\"I know it's hard,\" Demoux said below, \"without the Survivor. I know\nyou're afraid of the armies. Trust me, I know. I see them too. I know you\nsuffer beneath this siege. I. . .don't know if I can even tell you not to worry.\nThe Survivor himself knew great hardship—the death of his wife, his\nimprisonment in the Pits of Hathsin.

We have to live on, no matter how hard this all gets. We'll win, in the\nend. Just like he did.\"\nHe stood with his mug in his hands, looking nothing like the skaa\npreachers Vin had seen. Kelsier had chosen a passionate man to found his\nreligion—or, more precisely, to found the revolution the religion had come\nfrom. Kelsier had needed leaders who could enflame supporters, whip them\nup into a destructive upheaval.\nDemoux was something different. He didn't shout, but spoke calmly.\nYet, people paid attention. They sat on the stones around him, looking up\nwith hopeful—even worshipful—eyes.\n\"The Lady Heir,\" one of them whispered. \"What of her?\"\n\"Lady Vin bears a great responsibility,\" Demoux said. \"You can see the\nweight bowing her down, and how frustrated she is with the problems in the\ncity. She is a straightforward woman, and I don't think she likes the\nAssembly's politicking.\"\n\"But, she'll protect us, right?\" one asked.\n\"Yes,\" Demoux said. \"Yes, I believe she will. Sometimes, I think that\nshe's even more powerful than the Survivor was. You know that he only had\ntwo years to practice as a Mistborn? She's barely had that much time\nherself.\"\nVin turned away. It comes back to that, she thought. They sound\nrational until they talk about me, and then. . .\n\"She'll bring us peace, someday,\" Demoux said. \"The heir will bring\nback the sun, stop the ash from falling. But we have to survive until then.\nAnd we have to fight. The Survivor's entire work was to see the Lord Ruler\ndead and make us free. What gratitude do we show if we run now that\narmies have come?\n\"Go and tell your Assemblymen that you don't want Lord Cett, or even\nLord Penrod, to be your king. The vote happens in one day, and we need to\nmake certain the right man is made king. The Survivor chose Elend\nVenture, and that is whom we must follow.\"\nThat's new, Vin thought.\n\"Lord Elend is weak,\" one of the people said. \"He won't defend us.\"\n\"Lady Vin loves him,\" Demoux said. \"She wouldn't love a weak man.\nPenrod and Cett treat you like the skaa used to be treated, and that's why\nyou think they're strong. But that's not strength—it's oppression. We have to\nbe better than that! We have to trust the Survivor's judgment!\"\nVin relaxed against the lip of the roof, tension melting a bit. If Demoux\nreally was the spy, then he wasn't going to give her any evidence this night.\nSo, she put her knives away, then rested with her arms folded on the\nrooftop's edge. The fire crackled in the cool winter evening, sending billows\nof smoke to mix with the mists, and Demoux continued to speak in his\nquiet, reassuring voice, teaching the people about Kelsier.\nIt's not even really a religion, Vin thought as she listened.

The theology\nis so simple—not at all like the complex beliefs that Sazed speaks about.\nDemoux taught basic concepts. He held up Kelsier as a model, talking\nabout survival, and about enduring hardships. Vin could see why the direct\nwords would appeal to the skaa. The people really only had two choices: to\nstruggle on, or to give up. Demoux's teachings gave them an excuse to keep\nliving.\nThe skaa didn't need rituals, prayers, or codes. Not yet. They were too\ninexperienced with religion in general, too frightened of it, to want such\nthings. But, the more she listened, the more Vin understood the Church of\nthe Survivor. It was what they needed; it took what the skaa already knew—\na life filled with hardship—and elevated it to a higher, more optimistic\nplane.\nAnd the teachings were still evolving. The deification of Kelsier she\nhad expected; even the reverence for her was understandable. But, where\ndid Demoux get the promises that Vin would stop the ash and bring back\nthe sun? How did he know to preach of green grasses and blue skies,\ndescribing the world as it was known only in some of the world's most\nobscure texts?\nHe described a strange world of colors and beauty—a place foreign\nand difficult to conceive, but somehow wonderful all the same. Flowers and\ngreen plants were strange, alien things to these people; even Vin had trouble\nvisualizing them, and she had heard Sazed's descriptions.\nDemoux was giving the skaa a paradise. It had to be something\ncompletely removed from normal experience, for the mundane world was\nnot a place of hope. Not with a foodless winter approaching, not with\narmies threatening and the government in turmoil.\nVin pulled back as Demoux finally ended the meeting. She lay for a\nmoment, trying to decide how she felt. She'd been near certain about\nDemoux, but now her suspicions seemed unfounded. He'd gone out at night,\ntrue, but she saw now what he was doing. Plus, he'd acted so suspiciously\nwhen sneaking out. It seemed to her, as she reflected, that a kandra would\nknow how to go about things in a much more natural way.\nIt's not him, she thought. Or, if it is, he's not going to be as easy to\nunmask as I thought. She frowned in frustration. Finally, she just sighed,\nrising, and walked to the other side of the roof. OreSeur followed, and Vin\nglanced at him. \"When Kelsier told you to take his body,\" she said, \"what\ndid he want you to preach to these people?\"\n\"Mistress?\" OreSeur asked.\n\"He had you appear, as if you were him returned from the grave.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, what did he have you say?\"\nOreSeur shrugged. \"Very simple things, Mistress. I told them that the\ntime for rebellion had arrived. I told them that I—Kelsier—had returned to\ngive them hope for victory.\"\nI represent that thing you've never been able to kill, no matter how"

They had been Kelsier's final words, spoken face-to-face with\nthe Lord Ruler. I am hope.\nI am hope.\nWas it any wonder that this concept would become central to the\nchurch that sprang up around him? \"Did he have you teach things like we\njust heard Demoux say?\" Vin asked. \"About the ash no longer falling, and\nthe sun turning yellow?\"\n\"No, Mistress.\"\n\"That's what I thought,\" Vin said as she heard rustling on the stones\nbelow. She glanced over the side of the building, and saw Demoux\nreturning to the palace.\nVin dropped to the alleyway floor behind him. To the man's credit, he\nheard her, and he spun, hand on dueling cane.\n\"Peace, Captain,\" she said, rising.\n\"Lady Vin?\" he asked with surprise.\nShe nodded, approaching closer so that he'd be able to see her better in\nthe night. Fading torchlight still lit the air from behind, swirls of mist\nplaying with shadows.\n\"I didn't know you were a member of the Church of the Survivor,\" she\nsaid softly.\nHe looked down. Though he was easily two hands taller than she, he\nseemed to shrink a bit before her. \"I. . .I know it makes you uncomfortable.\nI'm sorry.\"\n\"It's all right,\" she said. \"You do a good thing for the people. Elend\nwill appreciate hearing of your loyalty.\"\nDemoux looked up. \"Do you have to tell him?\"\n\"He needs to know what the people believe, Captain. Why would you\nwant me to keep it quiet?\"\nDemoux sighed. \"I just. . .I don't want the crew to think I'm out here\npandering to the people. Ham thinks preaching about the Survivor is silly,\nand Lord Breeze says the only reason to encourage the church is to make\npeople more pliant.\"\nVin regarded him in the darkness. \"You really believe, don't you?\"\n\"Yes, my lady.\"\n\"But you knew Kelsier,\" she said. \"You were with us from near the\nbeginning. You know he's no god.\"\nDemoux looked up, a bit of a challenge in his eyes. \"He died to\noverthrow the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"That doesn't make him divine.\"\n\"He taught us how to survive, to have hope.\"\n\"You survived before,\" Vin said. \"People had hope before Kelsier got\nthrown in those pits.\"\n\"Not like we do now,\" Demoux said. \"Besides. . .he had power, my\nlady. I felt it.\"\nVin paused. She knew the story; Kelsier had used Demoux as an\nexample to the rest of the army in a fight with a skeptic, directing his blows\nwith Allomancy, making Demoux seem as if he had supernatural powers.\n\"Oh, I know about Allomancy now,\" Demoux said. \"But. . .I felt him\nPushing on my sword that day. I felt him use me, making me more than I\nwas. I think I can still feel him, sometimes. Strengthening my arm, guiding\nmy blade. . ..\""

You came to the caverns where we were hiding\non the day when the army was destroyed. I was on guard duty. You know,\nmy lady—even then, I knew that Kelsier would come for us. I knew that\nhe'd come and get those of us who had been faithful and guide us back to\nLuthadel.\"\nHe went to those caves because I forced him to. He wanted to get\nhimself killed fighting an army on his own.\n\"The destruction of the army was a test,\" Demoux said, looking up into\nthe mists. \"These armies. . .the siege. . .they're just tests. To see if we will\nsurvive or not.\"\n\"And the ash?\" Vin asked. \"Where did you hear that it would stop\nfalling?\"\nDemoux turned back to her. \"The Survivor taught that, didn't he?\"\nVin shook her head.\n\"A lot of the people are saying it,\" Demoux said. \"It must be true. It fits\nwith everything else—the yellow sun, the blue sky, the plants. . ..\"\n\"Yes, but where did you first hear those things?\"\n\"I'm not sure, my lady.\"\nWhere did you hear that I would be the one to bring them about? she\nthought, but she somehow couldn't bring herself to voice the question.\nRegardless, she knew the answer: Demoux wouldn't know. Rumors were\npropagating. It would be difficult indeed to trace them back to their source\nnow.\n\"Go back to the palace,\" Vin said. \"I have to tell Elend what I saw, but\nI'll ask him not to tell the rest of the crew.\"\n\"Thank you, my lady,\" Demoux said, bowing. He turned and hurried\naway. A second later, Vin heard a thump from behind: OreSeur, jumping\ndown to the street.\nShe turned. \"I was sure it was him.\"\n\"Mistress?\"\n\"The kandra,\" Vin said, turning back toward the disappearing Demoux.\n\"I thought I'd discovered him.\"\n\"And?\"\nShe shook her head. \"It's like Dockson—I think Demoux knows too\nmuch to be faking. He feels. . .real to me.\"\n\"My brethren—\"\n\"Are quite skilled,\" Vin said with a sigh. \"Yes, I know. But we're not\ngoing to arrest him. Not tonight, at least. We'll keep an eye on him, but I\njust don't think it's him anymore.\"\nOreSeur nodded.\n\"Come on,\" she said. \"I want to check on Elend.\"\nAnd so, I come to the focus of my argument. I apologize. Even forcing\nmy words into steel, sitting and scratching in this frozen cave, I am prone to\nramble.\n37\nSAZED GLANCED AT THE WINDOW SHUTTERS, noting the\nhesitant beams of light that were beginning to shine through the cracks.\nMorning already? he thought.

He had tapped no wakefulness, yet he felt more alert—more alive\n—than he had in days.\nTindwyl sat in the chair beside him. Sazed's desk was filled with loose\npapers, two sets of ink and pen waiting to be used. There were no books;\nKeepers had no need of such.\n\"Ah!\" Tindwyl said, grabbing a pen and beginning to write. She didn't\nlook tired either, but she had likely dipped into her bronzemind, tapping the\nwakefulness stored within.\nSazed watched her write. She almost looked young again; he hadn't\nseen such overt excitement in her since she had been abandoned by the\nBreeders some ten years before. On that day, her grand work finished, she\nhad finally joined her fellow Keepers. Sazed had been the one to present her\nwith the collected knowledge that had been discovered during her thirty\nyears of cloistered childbirth.\nIt hadn't taken her long to achieve a place in the Synod. By then,\nhowever, Sazed had been ousted from their ranks.\nTindwyl finished writing. \"The passage is from a biography of King\nWednegon,\" she said. \"He was one of the last leaders who resisted the Lord\nRuler in any sort of meaningful combat.\"\n\"I know who he was,\" Sazed said, smiling.\nShe paused. \"Of course.\" She obviously wasn't accustomed to studying\nwith someone who had access to as much information as she did. She\npushed the written passage over to Sazed; even with his mental indexes and\nself-notes, it would be faster for her to write out the passage than it would\nbe for him to try and find it within his own copperminds.\nI spent a great deal of time with the king during his final weeks, the\ntext read.\nHe seemed frustrated, as one might imagine. His soldiers could not\nstand against the Conqueror's koloss, and his men had been beaten back\nrepeatedly ever since FellSpire. However, the king didn't blame his soldiers.\nHe thought that his problems came from another source: food.\nHe mentioned this idea several times during those last days. He\nthought that if he'd had more food, he could have held out. In this,\nWednegon blamed the Deepness. For, though the Deepness had been\ndefeated—or at least weakened—its touch had depleted Darrelnai's food\nstores.\nHis people could not both raise food and resist the Conqueror's demon\narmies. In the end, that was why they fell.\nSazed nodded slowly. \"How much of this text do we have?\"\n\"Not much,\" Tindwyl said. \"Six or seven pages. This is the only\nsection that mentions the Deepness.\"\nSazed sat quietly for a moment, rereading the passage. Finally, he\nlooked up at Tindwyl. \"You think Lady Vin is right, don't you? You think\nthe Deepness was mist.\"\nTindwyl nodded.\n\"I agree,\" Sazed said. \"At the very least, what we now call 'the\nDeepness' was some sort of change in the mist.\"\n\"And your arguments from before?\"\n\"Proven wrong,\" Sazed said, setting down the paper. \"By your words"

The return of the Deepness could destroy us. I\ndid not want this information—but neither could I pass by the opportunity\nto discover it.\"\nTindwyl looked away. \"I do not believe that this will destroy us, Sazed.\nYou have made a grand discovery, that I will admit. The writings of the man\nKwaan tell us much. Indeed, if the Deepness was the mists, then our\nunderstanding of the Lord Ruler's Ascension has been enhanced greatly.\"\n\"And if the mists are growing stronger?\" Sazed asked. \"If, by killing\nthe Lord Ruler, we also destroyed whatever force was keeping the mists\nchained?\"\n\"We have no proof that the mists are coming by day,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"And on the possibility of them killing people, we have only your hesitant\ntheories.\"\nSazed glanced away. On the table, his fingers had smudged Tindwyl's\nhurriedly written words. \"That is true,\" he said.\nTindwyl sighed softly in the dim room. \"Why do you never defend\nyourself, Sazed?\"\n\"What defense is there?\"\n\"There must be some. You apologize and ask forgiveness, but your\napparent guilt never seems to change your behavior! Do you never think\nthat, perhaps, if you had been more outspoken, you might be leading the\nSynod? They cast you out because you refused to offer arguments on your\nown behalf. You're the most contrite rebel I've ever known.\"\nSazed didn't respond. He glanced to the side, seeing her concerned\neyes. Beautiful eyes. Foolish thoughts, he told himself, looking away.\nYou've always known that. Some things were meant for others, but never for\nyou.\n\"You were right about the Lord Ruler, Sazed,\" Tindwyl said. \"Perhaps\nthe others would have followed you if you had been just a little more. .\n.insistent.\"\nSazed shook his head. \"I am not a man from one of your biographies,\nTindwyl. I am not even, really, a man.\"\n\"You are a better man than they, Sazed,\" Tindwyl said quietly. \"The\nfrustrating part is, I've never been able to figure out why.\"\nThey fell silent. Sazed rose and walked to the window, opening the\nshutters, letting in the light. Then he extinguished the room's lamp.\n\"I will leave today,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"Leave?\" Sazed asked. \"The armies might not let you pass.\"\n\"I wasn't going to pass them, Sazed. I plan to visit them. I have given\nknowledge to young Lord Venture; I need to offer the same aid to his\nopponents.\"\n\"Ah,\" Sazed said. \"I see. I should have realized this.\""

You must be guided by your own conscience.\"\n\"Sometimes, people only seem determined upon one course because\nthey have been offered no other options.\"\nSazed turned toward her. The room was quiet, the only sounds coming\nfrom the courtyard below. Tindwyl sat half in sunlight, her bright robes\nslowly growing more illuminated as the shadows fell away. She seemed to\nbe implying something, something he had not expected to ever hear from\nher.\n\"I am confused,\" he said, sitting back down in a slow motion. \"What of\nyour duty as a Keeper?\"\n\"It is important,\" she admitted. \"But. . .certain, occasional exceptions\nmust be allowed. This rubbing you found. . .well, perhaps it merits further\nstudy before I depart.\"\nSazed watched her, trying to read her eyes. What is it I feel? he\nwondered. Confused? Dumbfounded?\nAfraid?\n\"I cannot be what you wish, Tindwyl,\" he said. \"I am not a man.\"\nShe waved her hand indifferently. \"I have had more than enough of\n'men' and childbearing over the years, Sazed.

But this job is changing me.\"\n\"Well, if you want to keep the job, we should probably get back to\nstudying. We only have one day left.\"\nElend shook his head. \"I've read all I can, Ham. I will not take\nadvantage of the law, so there's no reason to search for loopholes, and\nstudying other books looking for inspiration just isn't working. I need time\nto think. Time to walk. . ..\"\nThey continued to do so. As they did, Elend noticed something out in\nthe distance. A group of enemy soldiers doing something he couldn't\ndistinguish. He waved over one of his men.\n\"What is that?\" he asked.\nThe soldier shaded his eyes, looking. \"Looks like another skirmish\nbetween Cett's men and Straff's, Your Majesty.\"\nElend raised an eyebrow. \"That happens often?\"\nThe soldier shrugged. \"More and more often, lately.

Usually the\nscouting patrols run afoul of each other and get into a conflict. Leave a few\nbodies behind when they retreat. Nothing big, Your Majesty.\"\nElend nodded, dismissing the man. Big enough, he thought to himself.\nThose armies must be as tense as we are. The soldiers can't enjoy remaining\nso long in a siege, particularly with the winter weather.\nThey were close. The arrival of the koloss would only cause more\nchaos. If he shoved right, Straff and Cett would be pushed into a head-on\nbattle. I just need a little more time! he thought, continuing to walk, Ham at\nhis side.\nYet, first he needed to get his throne back. Without that authority, he\nwas nothing—and could do nothing.\nThe problem gnawed at his mind. As the walk continued, however,\nsomething distracted him—this time, something inside the walls rather than\noutside of them. Ham was right—the soldiers did stand a little taller when\nElend approached their posts. They saluted him, and he nodded to them,\nwalking with hand on pommel, as Tindwyl had instructed.\nIf I do keep my throne, I owe it to that woman, he thought. Of course,\nshe'd chastise him for that thought. She would tell him that he kept his\nthrone because he deserved to—because he was king. In changing himself,\nhe had simply used the resources at hand to overcome his challenges.\nHe wasn't certain if he'd ever be able to see things that way. But, her\nfinal lesson to him the day before—he somehow knew that it was her last—\nhad taught him only one new concept: that there was no one mold for\nkingship. He would not be like the kings of the past, any more than he\nwould be like Kelsier.\nHe would be Elend Venture. His roots were in philosophy, so he would\nbe remembered as a scholar. He'd best use that to his advantage, or he\nwouldn't be remembered at all. No kings could admit their weaknesses, but\nthey were certainly wise to admit their strengths.\nAnd what are my strengths? he thought. Why should I be the one who\nrules this city, and those around it?\nYes, he was a scholar—and an optimist, as Ham had noted. He was no\nmaster duelist, though he was improving. He wasn't an excellent diplomat,\nthough his meetings with Straff and Cett proved that he could hold his own.\nWhat was he?\nA nobleman who loved the skaa. They'd always fascinated him, even\nbefore the Collapse—before he'd met Vin and the others. It had been one of\nhis pet philosophical puzzles to try and prove them no different from men\nof noble birth. It sounded idealistic, even a little prim, when he thought\nabout it—and, if he was truthful, much of his interest in the skaa before the\nCollapse had been academic. They had been unknown, and so they had\nseemed exotic and interesting.\nHe smiled. I wonder what the plantation workers would have thought,\nhad anyone told them they were \"exotic.\"\nBut then the Collapse had come—the rebellion predicted in his books"

I wonder what the plantation workers would have thought,\nhad anyone told them they were \"exotic.\"\nBut then the Collapse had come—the rebellion predicted in his books\nand theories coming to life. His beliefs hadn't been able to continue as mere\nacademic abstractions. And he'd come to know the skaa—not just Vin and\nthe crew, but the workers and the servants. He'd seen the hope beginning to\ngrow within them. He'd seen the awakening of self-respect, and of self-\nworth, in the people of the city, and it excited him.\nHe would not abandon them.\nThat's what I am, Elend thought, pausing as he walked the wall. An\nidealist. A melodramatic idealist who, despite his books and learning, never\ndid make a very good nobleman.\n\"What?\" Ham asked, stopping next to him.\nElend turned toward him. \"I've got an idea,\" he said.\nThis is the problem. Though I believed in Alendi at first, I later became\nsuspicious. It seemed that he fit the signs, true. But, well, how can I explain\nthis?\nCould it be that he fit them too well?\n38\nHOW CAN HE POSSIBLY LOOK so confident when I feel so\nnervous? Vin thought, standing beside Elend as the Assembly Hall began to\nfill. They had arrived early; this time, Elend said he wanted to appear in\ncontrol by being the one who greeted each Assemblyman as he arrived.\nToday, the vote for king would occur.\nVin and Elend stood on the stage, nodding to the Assemblymen as they\nentered through the room's side door. On the floor of the room, the benches\nwere already growing crowded. The first few rows, as always, were seeded\nwith guards.\n\"You look beautiful today,\" Elend said, looking at Vin.\nVin shrugged. She had worn her white gown, a flowing garment with a\nfew diaphanous layers on the top. Like the others, it was designed for\nmobility, and it matched Elend's new outfits—especially with the dark\nembroidery on the sleeves. Her jewelry was gone, but she did have a few\nwhite wooden barrettes for her hair.\n\"It's odd,\" she said, \"how quickly wearing these gowns became natural\nfor me again.\"\n\"I'm glad you made the switch,\" Elend said. \"The trousers and shirt are\nyou. . .but this is you, too. The part of you I remember from the balls, when\nwe barely knew each other.\"\nVin smiled wistfully, looking up at him, the gathering crowd growing a\nbit more distant. \"You never did dance with me.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, holding her arm with a light touch. \"We haven't\nhad much time for each other lately, have we?\"\nVin shook her head.\n\"I'll fix that,\" Elend said. \"Once this confusion is all through, once the\nthrone is secure, we can get back to us.\"\nVin nodded, then turned sharply as she noticed movement behind her.\nAn Assemblyman walking across the stage.\n\"You're jumpy,\" Elend said, frowning slightly. \"Even more than usual.\nWhat am I missing?\"\nVin shook her head. \"I don't know.\"\nElend greeted the Assemblyman—one of the skaa representatives—"

Vin stood at his side, her earlier wistfulness\nevaporating like mist as her mind returned to the moment. What is\nbothering me?\nThe room was packed—everyone wanted to witness the events of the\nday. Elend had been forced to post guards at the doors to maintain order.\nBut, it wasn't just the number of people that made her edgy. It was a sense\nof. . .wrongness to the event. People were gathering like carrion feeders to a\nrotting carcass.\n\"This isn't right,\" Vin said, holding Elend's arm as the Assemblyman\nmoved off. \"Governments shouldn't change hands based on arguments\nmade from a lectern.\"\n\"Just because it hasn't happened that way in the past doesn't mean it\nshouldn't happen,\" Elend said.\nVin shook her head. \"Something is going to go wrong, Elend. Cett will\nsurprise you, and maybe Penrod will, too. Men like them won't sit still and\nlet a vote decide their future.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said. \"But they aren't the only ones who can offer up\nsurprises.\"\nVin looked at him quizzically. \"You're planning something?\"\nHe paused, then glanced at her. \"I. . .well, Ham and I came up with\nsomething last night. A ploy. I've been trying to find a way to talk to you\nabout it, but there just hasn't been time. We had to move quickly.\"\nVin frowned, sensing his apprehension. She started to say something,\nbut then stopped, studying his eyes. He seemed a little embarrassed.\n\"What?\" she asked.\n\"Well. . .it kind of involves you, and your reputation. I was going to\nask permission, but. . .\"\nVin felt a slight chill. Behind them, the last Assemblyman took his\nseat, and Penrod stood up to conduct the meeting. He glanced toward Elend,\nclearing his throat.\nElend cursed quietly. \"Look, I don't have time to explain,\" he said.\n\"But, it's really not a big deal—it might not even get me that many votes.\nBut, well, I had to try. And it doesn't change anything. Between us, I mean.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Lord Venture?\" Penrod said. \"Are you ready for this meeting to\nbegin?\"\nThe hall grew quiet. Vin and Elend still stood in the center of the stage,\nbetween the lectern and the seats of the Assembly members. She looked at\nhim, torn between a sense of dread, a sense of confusion, and a slight sense\nof betrayal.\nWhy didn't you tell me? she thought. How can I be ready if you don't\ntell me what you're planning? And. . .why are you looking at me like that?\n\"I'm sorry,\" Elend said, moving over to take his seat.\nVin remained standing alone before the audience. Once, so much\nattention would have terrified her. It still made her uncomfortable. She\nducked her head slightly, walking toward the back benches and her empty\nspot.\nHam wasn't there.

There, she thought, finding Ham in the audience, sitting\ncalmly with a group of skaa. The group was obviously conversing quietly,\nbut even with tin, Vin would never be able to pick out their voices in the\nlarge crowd. Breeze stood with some of Ham's soldiers at the back of the\nroom. It didn't matter if they knew about Elend's plan—they were too far\naway for her to interrogate them.\nAnnoyed, she arranged her skirts, then sat. She hadn't felt so blind\nsince. . .\nSince that night a year ago, she thought, that moment just before we\nfigured out Kelsier's true plan, that moment when I thought everything was\ncollapsing around me.\nPerhaps that was a good sign. Had Elend cooked up some last-minute\nflash of political brilliance? It didn't really matter that he hadn't shared it\nwith her; she probably wouldn't understand the legal basis for it anyway.\nBut. . .he always shared his plans with me before.\nPenrod continued to drone on, likely maximizing his time in front of\nthe Assembly. Cett was on the front bench of the audience, surrounded by a\ngood twenty soldiers, sitting with a look of self-satisfaction. As well he\nshould. From the accounts she'd heard, Cett stood to take the vote with ease.\nBut what was Elend planning?\nPenrod will vote for himself, Vin thought. So will Elend. That leaves\ntwenty-two votes. The merchants are behind Cett, and so are the skaa.\nThey're too afraid of that army to vote for anyone else.\nThat only leaves the nobility. Some of them will vote for Penrod—he's\nthe strongest nobleman in the city; many of the members of the Assembly\nare longtime political allies of his. But, even if he takes half of the nobility—\nwhich he probably won't—Cett will win. Cett only needs a two-thirds\nmajority to get the throne.\nEight merchants, eight skaa. Sixteen men on Cett's side. He was going\nto win. What could Elend possibly do?\nPenrod finally finished his opening announcements. \"But, before we\nvote,\" he said, \"I would like to offer time to the candidates to make any\nfinal addresses they wish. Lord Cett, would you care to go first?\"\nIn the audience, Cett shook his head. \"I've made my offers and my\nthreats, Penrod. You all know you have to vote for me.\"\nVin frowned. He seemed certain of himself, and yet. . .She scanned the\ncrowd, eyes falling on Ham. He was talking to Captain Demoux. And\nseated next to them was one of the men who had followed her in the\nmarket. A priest of the Survivor.\nVin turned, studying the Assembly. The skaa representatives looked\nuncomfortable. She glanced at Elend, who stood up to take his turn at the\nfront of the lectern. His earlier confidence had returned, and he looked regal\nin his sharp white uniform. He still wore his crown.\nIt doesn't change things, he'd said. Between us. . ..\nI'm sorry.\nSomething that would use her reputation to gain him votes. Her"

Her\nreputation was Kelsier's reputation, and only the skaa really cared about\nthat. And there was one easy way to gain influence with them. . ..\n\"You joined the Church of the Survivor, didn't you?\" she whispered.\nThe reactions of the skaa Assemblymen, the logic of the moment,\nElend's words to her before, all of them suddenly made sense. If Elend\njoined the Church, the skaa Assemblymen might be afraid to vote against\nhim. And, Elend didn't need sixteen votes to gain the throne; if the\nAssembly deadlocked, he won. With the eight skaa and his own vote, the\nothers would never be able to oust him.\n\"Very clever,\" she whispered.\nThe ploy might not work. It would depend on how much hold the\nChurch of the Survivor had on the skaa Assemblymen. Yet, even if some\nskaa voted against Elend, there were still the noblemen who would\nprobably vote for Penrod. If enough did, Elend would still deadlock the\nAssembly and keep his throne.\nAll it would cost was his integrity.\nThat's unfair, Vin told herself. If Elend had joined with the Church of\nthe Survivor, he would hold to whatever promises he had made. And, if the\nChurch of the Survivor gained official backing, it could become as powerful\nin Luthadel as the Steel Ministry had once been. And. . .how would that\nchange the way Elend saw her?\nThis doesn't change anything, he had promised.\nShe dully heard him begin to speak, and his references to Kelsier now\nseemed obvious to her. Yet, the only thing she could feel was a slight sense\nof anxiety. It was as Zane had said. She was the knife—a different kind of\nknife, but still a tool. The means by which Elend would protect the city.\nShe should be furious, or at least sick. Why did her eyes keep darting\ntoward the crowd? Why couldn't she focus on what Elend was saying, on\nhow he was elevating her? Why was she suddenly so on edge?\nWhy were those men subtly moving their way around the edges of the\nroom?\n\"So,\" Elend said, \"by the blessing of the Survivor himself, I ask you to\nvote for me.\"\nHe waited quietly. It was a drastic move; joining the Church of the\nSurvivor put Elend under the spiritual authority of an external group. But,\nHam and Demoux both had thought it a good idea. Elend had spent the\nbetter part of the previous day getting the word out to the skaa citizens\nabout his decision.\nIt felt like a good move. The only thing he worried about was Vin. He\nglanced at her. She didn't like her place in the Church of the Survivor, and\nhaving Elend join it meant that he—technically—accepted her part in the\nmythology. He tried to catch her eye and smile, but she wasn't watching\nhim. She was looking out into the audience.\nElend frowned.

Elend thought in shock. Fortunately, months spent sparring at\nTindwyl's command had given him instincts he didn't know he had. As the\nThug charged, Elend tucked and rolled. He hit the ground, scrambling, and\nturned to see the beefy man bearing down on him, dueling cane raised.\nA flurry of white lace and skirts fluttered through the air over Elend.\nVin slammed feet-first into the Thug, throwing him backward as she spun,\nskirts flaring.\nThe man grunted. Vin landed with a thump directly in front of Elend.\nThe Assembly Hall echoed with sudden screaming and shouts.\nVin kicked the lectern out of the way. \"Stay behind me,\" she\nwhispered, an obsidian dagger glittering in her right hand.\nElend nodded hesitantly, unbuckling the sword at his waist as he\nclimbed to his feet. The Thug wasn't alone; three small groups of armed\nmen were moving through the room. One attacked the front row, distracting\nthe guards there. Another group was climbing onto the dais. The third group\nseemed occupied by something in the crowd. Cett's soldiers.\nThe Thug had regained his feet. He didn't look like he had suffered\nmuch from Vin's kick.\nAssassins, Elend thought. But who sent them?\nThe man smiled as he was joined by a group of five friends. Chaos\nfilled the room, Assemblymen scattering, their bodyguards rushing to\nsurround them. Yet, the fighting in front of the stage kept anyone from\nescaping in that direction. The Assemblymen clogged around the stage's\nside exit. The attackers, however, didn't seem concerned with them.\nOnly with Elend.\nVin remained in her crouch, waiting for the men to attack first, her\nposture threatening despite the frilly dress. Elend thought he actually heard\nher growl quietly.\nThe men attacked.\nVin snapped forward, swiping at the lead Thug with a dagger. His\nreach was too great, however, and he easily fended her off with a swipe of\nhis staff. There were six men in total; three who were obviously Thugs,\nleaving the other three to likely be Coinshots or Lurchers. A strong\ncomponent of metal-controllers. Someone didn't want her ending this fight\nquickly with coins.\nThey didn't understand that she would never use coins in this situation.\nNot with Elend standing so close and with so many people in the room.\nCoins couldn't be deflected safely. If she shot a handful at her enemies,\nrandom people would die.\nShe had to kill these men fast. They were already fanning out,\nsurrounding her and Elend.

This time, the\nenemy Coinshots Pushed both items out of the way, deflecting them toward\nthe fleeing audience.\nMen shouted in desperation as they trampled and tried to force their\nway out of the room. Vin gritted her teeth. She needed a better weapon.\nShe flung a stone dagger at one assassin pair, then jumped toward\nanother, spinning beneath the attacking Thug's weapon. The Coinshot didn't\nhave any metal on him that she could sense; he was just there to keep her\nfrom killing the Thug with coins. They probably assumed that Vin would be\neasy to defeat, as she was deprived of the ability to shoot coins.\nThe Thug brought his staff back around, trying to catch her with the\nend. She caught the weapon, yanking it forward and jumping up as she\nPushed against the Assembly bleachers behind her. Her feet hit the Thug in\nthe chest, and she kicked hard with flared pewter.

He seemed completely\nsurprised, however, to find Vin streaking away from him, holding his staff\nin her hands.\nShe landed and spun toward Elend. He'd found himself a weapon—a\ndueling cane—and had the good sense to back himself against a wall. To\nher right, some of the Assemblymen stood in a huddle, surrounded by their\nguards. The room was too full, the exits too small and cramped, for them all\nto escape.\nThe Assemblymen made no moves to help Elend.\nOne of the assassins cried out, pointing as Vin Pushed against the\nbleachers and shot toward them, moving herself in front of Elend. Two\nThugs raised their weapons as Vin turned in the air, lightly Pulling against a\ndoor's hinges to spin herself. Her gown fluttered as she landed.\nI really have to thank that dressmaker, she thought as she raised the\nstaff. She briefly considered ripping the dress free anyway, but the Thugs\nwere upon her too quickly. She blocked both blows at once, then threw\nherself between the men, flaring pewter, moving faster than even they.\nOne of them cursed, trying to bring his staff around. Vin broke his leg\nbefore he could. He dropped with a howl, and Vin leaped onto his back,\nforcing him to the ground as she swung an overhand blow at the second\nThug. He blocked, then shoved his weapon against hers to throw her back\noff his companion.\nElend attacked. The king's actions, however, seemed sluggish\ncompared with the movements of men burning pewter.

Even so, she felt a flash of pain from her shoulder.\nWhere did he get the coins? she thought with frustration. However, as\nshe glanced to the side, she saw the Coinshot standing beside a cowering\nAssemblyman, who had been forced to give up his coin pouch.\nVin gritted her teeth. Her arm still worked. That was all that mattered.\nShe yelled and threw herself at the closest Thug. However, the third Thug\nhad regained his weapon—the one Vin had thrown—and was now circling\nwith his Coinshot to try and get behind Vin.\nOne at a time, Vin thought.\nThe Thug nearest her swung his weapon. She needed to surprise him.\nSo, she didn't dodge or block. She simply took his blow in the side, burning\nduralumin and pewter to resist. Something cracked, within her as she was\nhit, but with duralumin, she was strong enough to stay up. Wood shattered,\nand she continued forward, slamming her dagger into the Thug's neck.\nHe dropped, revealing a surprised Coinshot behind him. Vin's pewter\nevaporated with the duralumin, and pain blossomed like a sunrise in her\nside. Even so, she yanked her dagger free as the Thug fell, still moving\nquickly enough to drop the Coinshot with a dagger in the chest.\nThen she stumbled, gasping quietly, holding her side as two men died\nat her feet.\nOne Thug left, she thought desperately. And two Coinshots.\nElend needs me. To the side, she saw one of the Coinshots fire a spray\nof stolen coins at Elend. She cried out, Pushing them away, and she heard\nthe Coinshot cursing.\nShe turned—counting on the blue lines from her steel to warn her if\nthe Coinshots tried shooting anything else at Elend—and ripped her backup\nvial of metal from her sleeve, where it had been tied tightly to keep it from\nbeing Pulled away. However, even as she yanked the stopper open, the vial\nlurched from her now undexterous hand. The second Coinshot grinned as he\nPushed the vial away, tipping it and spraying its contents across the floor.\nVin growled, but her mind was growing fuzzy. She needed pewter.\nWithout it, the large coin wound in her shoulder—its blood turning her lacy\nsleeve red—and the crushing pain in her side were too much.

She Pushed them away without even\nlooking. In front of her, OreSeur struck the Thug from behind, making him\nspin in surprise just as Vin attacked.

Elend's\ntraining had apparently been enough to keep him alive—but only because\nhis opponents had to keep an eye on Vin to make certain she didn't try using\ncoins herself.\nVin kicked up the staff of the man she'd just killed, catching it. A\nCoinshot cried out as she growled and dashed toward them, spinning her\nweapon. One had the presence of mind to Push off the bleachers and launch\nhimself away. Vin's weapon still caught him in midair, throwing him to the\nside. The next swing took down his companion, who had tried to dash away.\nElend stood breathing heavily, his costume disheveled.\nHe did better than I thought he would, Vin admitted, flexing, trying to\njudge the damage to her side. She needed to get a bandage on that shoulder.\nThe coin hadn't hit bone, but the bleeding would—\n\"Vin!\" Elend cried out.\nSomething very strong suddenly grabbed her from behind. Vin choked\nas she was jerked backward and thrown to the ground.\nThe first Thug. She'd broken his leg, then forgotten—\nHe got his hands around her neck, squeezing as he knelt above her, his\nlegs pressing against her chest, his face wild with rage. His eyes bulged,\nadrenaline mixing with pewter.\nVin gasped for breath. She was taken back to years before, to beatings\nperformed by men looming above her. Camon, and Reen, and a dozen\nothers.\nNo! she thought, flaring her pewter, struggling. He had her pinned,\nhowever, and he was much larger then she was. Much stronger. Elend\nslammed his staff against the man's back, but the Thug barely even flinched.\nVin couldn't breathe. She felt her throat being crushed. She tried to pry\nthe Thug's hands apart, but it was as Ham had always said. Her small size\nwas a great advantage to her in most situations—but when it came down to\nbrute strength, she was no match for a man of bulk and muscle. She tried\nPulling herself to the side, but the man's grip was too strong, her weight too\nsmall compared with his.\nShe struggled in vain. She had duralumin still—burning it only made\nother metals vanish, not the duralumin itself—but last time that had nearly\ngotten her killed. If she didn't take the Thug down quickly, she'd be left\nwithout pewter once again.\nElend pounded, yelling for help, but his voice sounded distant. The\nThug pressed his face almost up against Vin's, and she could see his fury. At\nthat moment, incredibly, a thought occurred to her.\nWhere have I seen this man before?\nHer vision darkened. However, as the Thug constricted his grip, he\nleaned closer, closer, closer. . ..\nShe didn't have a choice. Vin burned duralumin and flared her pewter.\nShe flung her opponent's hands aside and smashed her head upward into his\nface.\nThe man's head exploded as easily as the eyeball had earlier.\nVin gasped for breath and pushed the headless corpse off her.

Elend\nstumbled back, his suit and face sprayed red. Vin stumbled to her feet. Her\nvision swam as her pewter dissipated—but even through that, she could see\nan emotion on Elend's face, stark as the blood on his brilliant white\nuniform.\nHorror.\nNo, she thought, her mind fading. Please, Elend, not that. . ..\nShe fell forward, unable to maintain consciousness.\nElend sat in his ruined suit, hands against forehead, the wreckage of\nthe Assembly Hall hauntingly empty around him.\n\"She'll live,\" Ham said. \"She actually isn't hurt that badly. Or. . .well,\nnot that badly for Vin. She just needs plenty of pewter and some of Sazed's\ncare. He says the ribs aren't even broken, just cracked.\"\nElend nodded absently. Some soldiers were clearing away the corpses,\namong them the six men that Vin had killed, including the one at the end. .\n..\nElend squeezed his eyes shut.\n\"What?\" Ham asked.\nElend opened his eyes, forming his hand into a fist to keep it from\nshaking. \"I know you've seen a lot of battles, Ham,\" he said. \"But, I'm not\nused to them. I'm not used to. . .\" He turned away as the soldiers dragged\naway the headless body.\nHam watched the corpse go.\n\"I've only actually seen her fight once before, you know,\" Elend said\nquietly. \"In the palace, a year ago. She only threw a few men against the\nwalls. It was nothing like this.\"\nHam took a seat beside Elend on the benches. \"She's Mistborn, El.\nWhat did you expect? A single Thug can easily take down ten men—\ndozens, if he has a Coinshot to support him. A Mistborn. . .well, they're like\nan army in one person.\"\nElend nodded. \"I know, Ham. I know she killed the Lord Ruler—she's\neven told me how she faced several Steel Inquisitors. But. . .I've just never\nseen. . .\"\nHe closed his eyes again. The image of Vin stumbling toward him at\nthe end, her beautiful white ball gown covered in the gore of a man she'd\njust killed with her forehead. . .\nShe did it to protect me, he thought. But that doesn't make it any less\ndisturbing.\nMaybe that even makes it a little more disturbing.\nHe forced his eyes open. He couldn't afford to be distracted; he had to\nbe strong. He was king.\n\"You think Straff sent them?\" Elend asked.\nHam nodded. \"Who else? They targeted you and Cett. I guess your\nthreat to kill Straff wasn't as binding as we assumed.\"\n\"How is Cett?\"\n\"He barely escaped alive. As it is, they slaughtered half of his soldiers.\nIn the fray, Demoux and I couldn't even see what was happening up on the\nstage with you and Vin.\"\nElend nodded. By the time Ham had arrived, Vin had already dealt\nwith the assassins. It had taken her only a few minutes to wipe out all six of\nthem."

It had taken her only a few minutes to wipe out all six of\nthem.\nHam was silent for a moment. Finally, he turned to Elend. \"I'll admit,\nEl,\" he said quietly. \"I'm impressed. I didn't see the fight, but I saw the\naftermath. It's one thing to fight six Allomancers, but it's another to do that\nwhile trying to protect a regular person, and to keep any by-standers from\nharm. And that last man. . .\"\n\"Do you remember when she saved Breeze?\" Elend asked. \"It was so\nfar away, but I swear I saw her throw horses into the air with her\nAllomancy. Have you ever heard of anything like that?\"\nHam shook his head.\nElend sat quietly for a moment. \"I think we need to do some planning.\nWhat with today's events, we can't. . .\"\nHam looked up as Elend trailed off. \"What?\"\n\"Messenger,\" Elend said, nodding toward the doorway. Sure enough,\nthe man presented himself to the soldiers, then was escorted up to the stage.\nElend stood, walking over to meet the short man, who wore Penrod's\nheraldry on his coat.\n\"My lord,\" the man said, bowing. \"I've been sent to inform you that the\nvoting will proceed at Lord Penrod's mansion.\"\n\"The voting?\" Ham asked. \"What nonsense is this? His Majesty was\nnearly killed today!\"\n\"I'm sorry, my lord,\" the aide said. \"I was simply told to deliver the\nmessage.\"\nElend sighed. He'd hoped that, in the confusion, Penrod wouldn't\nremember the deadline. \"If they don't choose a new leader today, Ham, then\nI get to retain the crown. They've already wasted their grace period.\"\nHam sighed. \"And if there are more assassins?\" he asked quietly. \"Vin\nwill be laid up for a few days, at least.\"\n\"I can't rely on her to protect me all the time,\" Elend said. \"Let's go.\"\n\"I vote for myself,\" Lord Penrod said.\nNot unexpected, Elend thought. He sat in Penrod's comfortable lounge,\naccompanied by a group of shaken Assemblymen—none of whom,\nthankfully, had been hurt in the attack. Several held drinks, and there was a\nveritable army of guards waiting around the perimeter, eyeing each other\nwarily. The crowded room also held Noorden and three other scribes, who\nwere there to witness the voting, according to the law.\n\"I vote for Lord Penrod as well,\" said Lord Dukaler.\nAlso not unexpected, Elend thought. I wonder how much that cost\nPenrod.\nMansion Penrod was not a keep, but it was lavishly decorated. The\nplushness of Elend's chair was welcome as a relief from the tensions of the\nday. Yet, Elend feared that it was too soothing. It would be very easy to drift\noff. . ..\n\"I vote for Cett,\" said Lord Habren.\nElend perked up.

It was the second for Cett, which put him behind\nPenrod by three.\nEveryone turned to Elend. \"I vote for myself,\" he said, trying to project\na firmness that was hard to maintain after everything that had happened.\nThe merchants were next. Elend settled back, prepared for the expected run\nof votes for Cett.\n\"I vote for Penrod,\" Philen said.\nElend sat upright, alert. What!\nThe next merchant voted for Penrod as well. As did the next, and the\nnext. Elend sat stunned, listening. What did I miss? he thought. He glanced\nat Ham, who shrugged in confusion.\nPhilen glanced at Elend, smiling pleasantly. Elend couldn't tell if there\nwas bitterness or satisfaction in that look, however. They switched\nallegiances? That quickly? Philen had been the one to sneak Cett into the\ncity in the first place.\nElend looked down the row of merchants, trying with little success to\ngauge their reactions. Cett himself wasn't in the meeting; he had retreated to\nKeep Hasting to nurse his wound.\n\"I vote for Lord Venture,\" said Haws, foremost of the skaa faction.\nThis also managed to get a stir out of the room. Haws met Elend's eye, and\nnodded. He was a firm believer in the Church of the Survivor, and while the\ndifferent preachers of the religion were beginning to disagree on how to\norganize their followers, they all agreed that a believer on the throne would\nbe better for them than handing the city over to Cett.\nThere will be a price to pay for this allegiance, Elend thought as the\nskaa voted. They knew Elend's reputation for honesty, and he would not\nbetray their trust.\nHe had told them he would become an open member of their sect. He\nhadn't promised them belief, but he had promised them devotion. He still\nwasn't certain what he had given away, but both of them knew they would\nneed each other.\n\"I vote for Penrod,\" said Jasten, a canal worker.\n\"As do I,\" said Thurts, his brother.\nElend gritted his teeth. He'd known they would be trouble; they never\nhad liked the Church of the Survivor. But, four of the skaa had already\ngiven him their votes. With only two remaining, he had a very good shot at\na deadlock.\n\"I vote for Venture,\" said the next man.\n\"I do, too,\" said the final skaa. Elend gave the man, Vet, a smile of\nappreciation.\nThat left fifteen votes for Penrod, two for Cett, and seven for Elend.\nDeadlock. Elend reclined slightly, head resting against the chair's pillowed\nback, sighing softly.\nYou did your job, Vin, he thought. I did mine. Now we just need to keep\nthis country in one piece.\n\"Um,\" a voice asked, \"am I allowed to change my vote?\"\nElend opened his eyes. It was Lord Habren, one of the votes for Cett.\n\"I mean, it's obvious now that Cett isn't going to win,\" Habren said,\nflushing slightly. The young man was a distant cousin of the Elariel family,\nwhich was probably how he'd gotten his seat. Names still meant power in\nLuthadel."

One by one, the members of the Assembly turned\nto Elend. Noorden the scribe met Elend's eyes. There was a clause allowing\nfor men to change their votes, assuming that the chancellor hadn't officially\nclosed the voting—which, indeed, he hadn't.\nThe clause was a rather oblique; Noorden was probably the only other\none in the room who knew the law well enough to interpret it. He nodded\nslightly, still meeting Elend's eyes. He would hold his tongue.\nElend sat still in a room full of men who trusted him, even as they\nrejected him. He could do as Noorden did. He could say nothing, or could\nsay that he didn't know.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said softly. \"The law allows for you to change your vote,\nLord Habren. You may only do so once, and must do so before the winner is\ndeclared. Everyone else has the same opportunity.\"\n\"Then I vote for Lord Penrod,\" Habren said.\n\"As do I,\" said Lord Hue, the other who had voted for Cett.\nElend closed his eyes.\n\"Are there any other alterations?\" Lord Penrod asked.\nNo one spoke.\n\"Then,\" Penrod said, \"I see seventeen votes for myself, seven votes for\nLord Venture. I officially close the voting and humbly accept your\nappointment as king. I shall serve as best I can in this capacity.\"\nElend stood, then slowly removed his crown. \"Here,\" he said, setting it\non the mantle. \"You'll need this.\"\nHe nodded to Ham, then left without looking back at the men who had\ndiscarded him.\nPART FOUR\nKNIVES\nI know your argument.

It wasn't just the mists, and it\nwasn't just the darkness. He could still remember her touch on his emotions.\n\"You've failed me, Zane,\" Straff said.\nThe Mistborn looked up, and—burning tin—Straff could see a frown\non his face. \"Failed?\"\n\"Venture and Cett still live. Beyond that, you sent a batch of my best\nAllomancers to their deaths.\"\n\"I warned you that they might die,\" Zane said.\n\"For a purpose, Zane,\" Straff said sternly. \"Why did you need a group"

You may assume our resources\nto be unlimited, but let me assure you—those six men cannot be replaced.\"\nIt had taken Straff decades of work with his mistresses to gather so\nmany hidden Allomancers. It had been pleasurable work, but work all the\nsame. In one reckless gambit, Zane had destroyed a good third of Straff's\nAllomancer children.\nMy children dead, our hand exposed, and that. . .creature of Elend's\nstill lives!\n\"I'm sorry, Father,\" Zane said. \"I thought that the chaos and crowded\nquarters would keep the girl isolated, and force her not to use coins. I really\nthought this would work.\"\nStraff frowned. He well knew that Zane thought himself more\ncompetent than his father; what Mistborn wouldn't think such a thing? Only\na delicate mixture of bribery, threats, and manipulation kept Zane under\ncontrol.\nYet, no matter what Zane thought, Straff was no fool. He knew, at that\nmoment, that Zane was hiding something. Why send those men to die?\nStraff thought. He must have intended them to fail—otherwise he would\nhave helped them fight the girl.\n\"No,\" Zane said softly, talking to himself as he sometimes did. \"He's\nmy father. . .\" He trailed off, then shook his head sharply. \"No. Not them\neither.\"\nLord Ruler, Straff thought, looking down at the muttering madman\nbeside him. What have I gotten myself into? Zane was growing more\nunpredictable. Had he sent those men to die out of jealousy, out of lust for\nviolence, or had he simply been bored? Straff didn't think that Zane had\nturned on him, but it was difficult to tell. Either way, Straff didn't like\nhaving to rely on Zane for his plans to work. He didn't really like having to\nrely on Zane for anything.\nZane looked up at Straff, and stopped talking. He did a good job of\nhiding his insanity, most of the time. A good enough job that Straff\nsometimes forgot about it. Yet, it still lurked there, beneath the surface.\nZane was as dangerous a tool as Straff had ever used. The protection\nprovided by a Mistborn outweighed the danger of Zane's insanity.\nBarely.\n\"You needn't worry, Father,\" Zane said. \"The city will still be yours.\"\n\"It will never be mine as long as that woman lives,\" Straff said. He\nshivered. Perhaps that's what this was all about. Zane's attack was so\nobvious that everyone in the city knows I was behind it, and when that\nMistborn demon wakes, she will come after me in retribution.\nBut, if that were Zane's goal, then why not just kill me himself? Zane\ndidn't make sense. He didn't have to. That was, perhaps, one of the\nadvantages of being insane.\nZane shook his head. \"I think you will be surprised, Father. One way"

He held up a hand, halting his procession.\nIn the distance, he could just barely pick out the flickering blobs of wall-top\ntorches. They were close to the city—uncomfortably close.\nStraff's procession waited quietly. Then, from the mists before them, a\nman on horseback appeared, accompanied by fifty soldiers of his own.\nFerson Penrod.\n\"Straff,\" Penrod said, nodding.\n\"Ferson.\"\n\"Your men did well,\" Penrod said. \"I'm glad your son didn't have to\ndie. He's a good lad. A bad king, but an earnest man.\"\nA lot of my sons died today, Ferson, Straff thought. The fact that Elend\nstill lives isn't fortunate—it's irony.\n\"You are ready to deliver the city?\" Straff asked.\nPenrod nodded. \"Philen and his merchants want assurances that they\nwill have titles to match those Cett promised them.\"\nStraff waved a dismissive hand. \"You know me, Ferson.\" You used to\npractically grovel before me at parties every week. \"I always honor business\nagreements. I'd be an idiot not to appease those merchants—they're the ones\nwho will bring me tax revenue from this dominance.\"\nPenrod nodded. \"I'm glad we could come to an understanding, Straff. I\ndon't trust Cett.\"\n\"I doubt you trust me,\" Straff said.\nPenrod smiled. \"But I do know you, Straff. You're one of us—a\nLuthadel nobleman. Besides, you have produced the most stable kingdom\nin the dominances. That's all we're looking for right now. A little stability\nfor this people.\"\n\"You almost sound like that fool son of mine.\"\nPenrod paused, then shook his head. \"Your boy isn't a fool, Straff. He's\njust an idealist. In truth, I'm sad to see his little utopia fall.\"\n\"If you are sad for him, Ferson, then you are an idiot, too.\"\nPenrod stiffened. Straff caught the man's proud eyes, holding them\nwith his stare, until Penrod looked down. The exchange was a simple one,\nmostly meaningless—but it did serve as a very important reminder.\nStraff chuckled. \"You're going to have to get used to being a small fish\nagain, Ferson.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"Be cheerful,\" Straff said. \"Assuming this turnover of power happens\nas you promised, no one will have to end up dead. Who knows, maybe I'll\nlet you keep that crown of yours.\"\nPenrod looked up.\n\"For a long time, this land didn't have kings,\" Straff said quietly. \"It\nhad something greater.

Penrod had always been clever; he'd\nbeen the most important nobleman to stay behind in Luthadel, and his\ngamble had certainly worked.\n\"The cost is exorbitant,\" Straff said. \"Ridiculously so.\"\n\"The atium,\" Penrod guessed.\nStraff nodded. \"Elend hasn't found it, but it's here, somewhere. I was\nthe one who mined those geodes—my men spent decades harvesting them\nand bringing them to Luthadel.

Now, what news did you bring of Elend's mistress?\"\n\"She collapsed after the fight,\" Penrod said. \"I employ a spy on the\ncooking staff, and she said she delivered a bowl of broth to Lady Vin's\nroom. It returned cold.\"\nStraff frowned. \"Could this woman of yours slip the Mistborn\nsomething?\"\nPenrod paled slightly. \"I. . .don't think that would be wise, my lord.\nBesides, you know Mistborn constitutions.\"\nPerhaps she really is incapacitated, Straff thought. If we moved in. .\n.The chill of her touch on his emotions returned. Numbness. Nothingness.\n\"You needn't fear her so, my lord,\" Penrod said.\nStraff raised an eyebrow. \"I'm not afraid, I'm wary. I will not move into\nthat city until my safety is assured—and until I move in, your city is in\ndanger from Cett. Or, worse. What would happen if those koloss decide to\nattack the city, Ferson?

He waited for a few\nmoments, staring into the mists. Then he looked at Straff, a curious\nexpression on his face. \"What time is it?\"\nStraff checked his pocket watch, something no Mistborn would carry.\nToo much metal. \"Eleven seventeen,\" he said.\nZane nodded, turning back to look at the city. \"It should have taken\neffect by now.\"\nStraff frowned. Then he began to sweat. He flared tin, clamping his\neyes shut. There! he thought, noticing a weakness inside of him. \"More\npoison?\" he asked, keeping the fear from his voice, forcing himself to be\ncalm.\n\"How do you do it, Father?\" Zane asked. \"I thought for certain you'd\nmissed this one. Yet, here you are, just fine.\"\nStraff was beginning to feel weak. \"One doesn't need to be Mistborn to\nbe capable, Zane,\" he snapped.\nZane shrugged, smiling in the haunting way only he could—keenly\nintelligent, yet eerily unstable. Then he just shook his head. \"You win\nagain,\" he said, then shot upward into the sky, churning mists with his\npassing.\nStraff immediately turned his horse, trying to maintain his decorum as\nhe urged it back toward the camp. He could feel the poison. Feel it stealing\nhis life. Feel it threatening him, overcoming him. . ..\nHe went, perhaps, too quickly. It was difficult to maintain an air of\nstrength when you were dying. Finally, he broke into a gallop. He left his\nstartled guards behind, and they called in surprise, breaking into a jog to try\nand keep up.\nStraff ignored their complaints. He kicked the horse faster. Could he\nfeel the poison slowing his reactions? Which one had Zane used?\nGurwraith? No, it required injection. Tompher, perhaps? Or. . .perhaps he\nhad found one that Straff didn't even know about.\nHe could only hope that wasn't the case. For, if Straff didn't know of\nthe poison, then Amaranta probably wouldn't know of it either, and wouldn't\nbe able to put the antidote into her catch-all healing potion.\nThe lights of camp illuminated the mists. Soldiers cried out as Straff\napproached, and he was nearly run through as one of his own men leveled a\nspear at the charging horse.

There was no way he\ncould hide this from Zane.\nI wouldn't be able to hide my death either.\n\"My lord!\" a captain said, dashing up to him.\n\"Send for Amaranta,\" Straff said, stumbling off his horse.\nThe soldier paused. \"Your mistress, lord?\" the man said, frowning.\n\"Why—\"\n\"Now!\" Straff commanded, throwing back his tent flap, walking inside.\nHe paused, legs trembling as the tent flap closed. He wiped his brow with a\nhesitant hand. Too much sweat.\nDamn him! he thought with frustration. I have to kill him, contain him.\n. .I have to do something. I can't rule like this!\nBut what? He'd sat up nights, he'd wasted days, trying to decide what\nto do about Zane. The atium he used to bribe the man no longer seemed a\ngood motivator. Zane's actions this day—slaughtering Straff's children in an\nobviously hopeless attempt to kill Elend's mistress—proved that he could\nno longer be trusted, even in a small way.\nAmaranta arrived with surprising speed, and she immediately began\nmixing her antidote. Eventually, as Straff slurped down the horrid-tasting\nconcoction—feeling its healing effects immediately—he came to an uneasy\nconclusion.\nZane had to die.\nAnd yet. . .something about all this seemed so convenient. It felt almost\nas if we constructed a hero to fit our prophecies, rather than allowing one\nto arise naturally. This was the worry I had, the thing that should have\ngiven me pause when my brethren came to me, finally willing to believe.\n40\nELEND SAT BESIDE HER BED.\nThat comforted her. Though she slept fitfully, a piece of her knew that\nhe was there, watching over her. It felt odd to be beneath his protective care,\nfor she was the one who usually did the guarding.\nSo, when she finally woke, she wasn't surprised to find him in the chair\nbeside her bed, reading quietly by soft candlelight. As she came fully\nawake, she didn't jump up, or search the room with apprehension. Instead,\nshe sat up slowly, pulling the blanket up under her arms, then took a sip of\nthe water that had been left for her beside the bed.\nElend closed the book and turned toward her, smiling. Vin searched\nthose soft eyes, delving for hints of the horror she had seen before. The\ndisgust, the terror, the shock.\nHe knew her for a monster. How could he smile so kindly?\n\"Why?\" she asked quietly.\n\"Why what?\" he asked.\n\"Why wait here?\" she said. \"I'm not dying—I remember that much.\"\nElend shrugged. \"I just wanted to be near you.\"\nShe said nothing.

Only then did she realize something she\nshould have noticed earlier. \"Elend! You're not wearing your uniform.\"\nHe looked down at his clothing—a nobleman's suit from his old\nwardrobe, with an unbuttoned maroon vest. The jacket was too big for him.\nHe shrugged. \"No need to continue the charade anymore, Vin.\"\n\"Cett is king?\" she asked with a sinking feeling.\nElend shook his head. \"Penrod.\"\n\"That doesn't make sense.\"\n\"I know,\" he said. \"We aren't sure why the merchants betrayed Cett—\nbut it doesn't really matter anymore. Penrod is a far better choice anyway.\nThan either Cett, or me.\"\n\"You know that's not true.\"\nElend sat back contemplatively. \"I don't know, Vin. I thought I was the\nbetter man. Yet, while I thought up all kinds of schemes to keep the throne\nfrom Cett, I never really considered the one plan that would have been\ncertain to defeat him—that of giving my support to Penrod, combining our\nvotes. What if my arrogance had landed us with Cett? I wasn't thinking of\nthe people.\"\n\"Elend. . .\" she said, laying a hand on his arm.\nAnd he flinched.\nIt was slight, almost unnoticeable, and he covered it quickly. But the\ndamage was done. Damage she had caused, damage within him. He had\nfinally seen—really seen—what she was. He'd fallen in love with a lie.\n\"What?\" he said, looking into her face.\n\"Nothing,\" Vin said. She withdrew her hand. Inside, something\ncracked. I love him so much. Why? Why did I let him see? If only I'd had a\nchoice!\nHe's betraying you, Reen's voice whispered in the back of her mind.\nEveryone will leave you eventually, Vin.\nElend sighed, glancing toward the shutters to her room. They were\nclosed, keeping the mists out, though Vin could see the darkness beyond.\n\"The thing is, Vin,\" he said quietly, \"I never really thought it would\nend this way. I trusted them, right to the end. The people—the\nAssemblymen they chose—I trusted that they would do the right thing.\nWhen they didn't choose me, I was actually surprised. I shouldn't have\nbeen. We knew that I was the long shot. I mean, they had already voted me\nout once. But, I'd convinced myself that was just a warning. Inside, in my\nheart, I thought that they would reinstate me.\"\nHe shook his head. \"Now, I either have to admit that my faith in them\nwas wrong, or I have to trust in their decision.\"\nThat was what she loved: his goodness, his simple honesty.

Things as\nodd and exotic to a skaa urchin as her own Mistborn nature must be to most\npeople. Even among all the good men of Kelsier's crew, even amid the best\nof the nobility, she had never found another man like Elend Venture. A man\nwho would rather believe that the people who had dethroned him were just\ntrying to do the right thing.\nAt times, she had felt a fool for falling in love with the first nobleman\nwhom she grew to know. But now she realized that her love of Elend had\nnot come about because of simple convenience or proximity. It had come\nbecause of who Elend was. The fact that she had found him first was an\nevent of incredible fortune.\nAnd now. . .it was over. At least, in the form it had once had. But, she'd\nknown all along that it would turn out this way. That was why she'd refused\nhis marriage proposal, now over a year old. She couldn't marry him. Or,\nrather, she couldn't let him marry her.\n\"I know that sorrow in your eyes, Vin,\" Elend said softly.\nShe looked at him with shock.\n\"We can get past this,\" he said. \"The throne wasn't everything. We\nmight be better off this way, actually. We did our best. Now it's someone\nelse's turn to try.\"\nShe smiled wanly. He doesn't know. He must never know how much\nthis hurts. He's a good man—he'd try to force himself to keep loving me.\n\"But,\" he said, \"you should get some more rest.\"\n\"I feel fine,\" Vin said, stretching slightly. Her side hurt, and her neck\nached, but pewter burned within her, and none of her wounds were\ndebilitating. \"I need to—\"\nShe cut herself off as a realization hit her. She sat upright, the sudden\nmotion making her rigid with pain. The day before was a blur, but. . .\n\"OreSeur!\" she said, pushing aside the blanket.\n\"He's fine, Vin,\" Elend said. \"He's a kandra. Broken bones mean\nnothing to him.\"\nShe paused, half out of bed, suddenly feeling foolish. \"Where is he?\"\n\"Digesting a new body,\" Elend said, smiling.\n\"Why the smile?\" she asked.\n\"I've just never heard someone express that much concern for a kandra\nbefore.\"\n\"Well, I don't see why not,\" Vin said, climbing back in bed. \"OreSeur\nrisked his life for me.\"\n\"He's a kandra, Vin,\" Elend repeated. \"I don't think those men could\nhave killed him; I doubt even a Mistborn could.\"\nVin paused. Not even a Mistborn could. . .. What bothered her about\nthat statement? \"Regardless,\" she said. \"He feels pain. He took two serious\nblows on my behalf.\"\n\"Just fulfilling his Contract.\"\nHis Contract. . .. OreSeur had attacked a human. He had broken his\nContract. For her.\n\"What?\" Elend asked.\n\"Nothing,\" Vin said quickly. \"Tell me about the armies.\"\nElend eyed her, but allowed the conversation to change directions."

And yet, he\nhasn't protested—he has to realize that he's trapped in here now.\"\n\"He must have really believed that we'd choose him,\" Vin said,\nfrowning. \"Why else would he come into the city?\"\nElend shook his head. \"It was an odd move in the first place. Anyway, I\nhave advised the Assembly to try and make a deal with him. I think he\nbelieves that the atium isn't in the city, so there's really no reason for him to\nwant Luthadel.\"\n\"Except for the prestige.\"\n\"Which wouldn't be worth losing his army,\" Elend's said. \"Or his life.\"\nVin nodded. \"And your father?\"\n\"Silent,\" Elend said. \"It's strange, Vin.

No, if they were from a city as close as Urteau—\nStraff's home—some of them would be known, wouldn't they? \"I thought I\nrecognized one of them,\" Vin finally said.\n\"Which one?\"\n\"The. . .last one.\"\nElend paused. \"Ah. Well, I guess we won't be able to identify him\nnow.\"\n\"Elend, I'm sorry you had to see that.\"\n\"What?\" Elend asked. \"Vin, I've seen death before. I was forced to\nattend the Lord Ruler's executions, remember?\" He paused. \"Not that what\nyou did was like that, of course.\"\nOf course.\n\"You were amazing,\" Elend said. \"I'd be dead right now if you hadn't\nstopped those Allomancers—and it's likely that Penrod and the other\nAssemblymen would have fared the same. You saved the Central\nDominance.\"\nWe always have to be the knives. . ..\nElend smiled, standing. \"Here,\" he said, walking to the side of the\nroom. \"This is cold, but Sazed said you should eat it when you awoke.\" He\nreturned with a bowl of broth.\n\"Sazed sent it?\" Vin asked skeptically. \"Drugged, then?\"\nElend smiled. \"He warned me not to taste it myself—he said it was\nfilled with enough sedatives to knock me out for a month. It takes a lot to\naffect you pewter burners.\"\nHe set the bowl on the bedstand. Vin eyed it through narrowed eyes.\nSazed was probably worried that, despite her wounds, she'd go out and\nprowl the city if she were left on her own. He was probably right.

He stood in\nthe shadows, watching her. It was still dark outside. The shutters to her\nwindow were open, and mist coated the floor of the room.\nThe shutters were open.\nVin sat upright and turned toward the figure in the corner. It wasn't\nElend. \"Zane,\" she said flatly.\nHe stepped forward. It was so easy to see the similarities between him\nand Elend, now that she knew what to look for. They had the same jaw, the\nsame wavy dark hair. They even had similar builds, now that Elend had\nbeen exercising.\n\"You sleep too soundly,\" Zane said.\n\"Even a Mistborn's body needs sleep to heal.\"\n\"You shouldn't have been hurt in the first place,\" Zane said. \"You\nshould have been able to kill those men with ease, but you were distracted\nby my brother, and by trying to keep the people of the room from harm.\nThis is what he's done to you—he's changed you, so that you no longer see\nwhat needs to be done, you just see what he wants you to do.\"\nVin raised an eyebrow, quietly feeling beneath her pillow. Her dagger\nwas there, fortunately. He didn't kill me in my sleep, she thought. That has\nto be a good sign.\nHe took another step forward. She tensed. \"What is your game, Zane?\"\nshe said. \"First, you tell me that you've decided not to kill me—then you\nsend a group of assassins. What now? Have you come to finish the job?\"\n\"We didn't send those assassins, Vin,\" Zane said quietly.\nVin snorted.\n\"Believe as you wish,\" Zane said, taking another step forward so that\nhe stood right beside her bed, a tall figure of blackness and solemnity. \"But,\nmy father is still terrified of you. Why would he risk retribution by trying to\nkill Elend?\"\n\"It was a gamble,\" Vin said. \"He hoped those assassins would kill me.\"\n\"Why use them?\" Zane asked. \"He has me—why use a bunch of\nMistings to attack you in the middle of a crowded room, when he could just\nhave me use atium in the night and kill you?\"\nVin hesitated.\n\"Vin,\" he said, \"I watched the corpses being carried away from the\nAssembly Hall, and I recognized some of them from Cett's entourage.\"\nThat's it! Vin thought. That's where I saw that Thug whose face I\nsmashed! He was at Keep Hasting, peeking out from the kitchen while we\nate with Cett, pretending to be a servant.\n\"But, the assassins attacked Cett too. . .\" Vin trailed off. It was basic\nthieving strategy: if you had a front that you wanted to escape suspicion as\nyou burgled the shops around it, you made certain to \"steal\" from yourself\nas well."

Straff\noffered the Assembly wealth beyond anything Cett could provide. That's\nwhy the merchants changed their votes. Cett must have gotten wind of their\nbetrayal.

Of course! \"And the only way that Cett could\nsee to win. . .\"\n\"Was to send the assassins,\" Zane said with a nod. \"They were to\nattack all three candidates, killing Penrod and Elend, but leaving Cett alive.\nThe Assembly would assume that they'd been betrayed by Straff, and Cett\nwould become king.\"\nVin gripped her knife with a shaking hand.

It's not. . .Elend's way.\nZane turned away, facing toward her window, staring at the small\nwaterfall-like flow of mist spilling through. \"I should have arrived sooner to\nthe fight. I was outside, with the crowds that came too late to get a seat. I\ndidn't even know what was happening until the people started piling out.\"\nVin raised an eyebrow. \"You almost sound sincere, Zane.\"\n\"I have no wish to see you dead,\" he said, turning. \"And I certainly\ndon't want to see harm befall Elend.\"\n\"Oh?\" Vin asked. \"Even though he's the one who had all the privileges,\nwhile you were despised and kept locked away?\"\nZane shook his head. \"It isn't like that.

The\nball of metal rolled in her palm. The shape was bumpy, but the texture was\nsmooth—like a nugget of gold. She knew it without having to swallow it.\n\"Atium?\"\n\"Cett may send other assassins,\" Zane said, hopping up onto the\nwindowsill.\n\"You're giving it to me?\" she asked. \"There's enough here for a good\ntwo minutes of burning!\" It was a small fortune, easily worth twenty\nthousand boxings before the Collapse.

Logically, she knew that other people\nprobably felt the same way; after all, who would enjoy pain and\ndebilitation? Yet, when the others got sick, she sensed frustration from\nthem. Not terror.\nWhen sick, Elend would spend the day in bed, reading books. Clubs\nhad taken a bad blow during practice several months before, and he had\ngrumbled about the pain, but had stayed off his leg for a few days without\nmuch prodding.\nVin was growing to be more like them. She could lie in bed as she did\nnow, knowing that nobody would try to slit her throat while she was too\nweak to call for help. Still, she itched to rise, to show that she wasn't very\nbadly wounded. Lest someone think otherwise, and try to take advantage.\nIt isn't like that anymore! she told herself. It was light outside, and\nthough Elend had been back to visit several times, he was currently away.\nSazed had come to check on her wounds, and had begged her to stay in bed\nfor \"at least one more day.\" Then he'd gone back to his studies. With\nTindwyl.\nWhat ever happened to those two hating each other? she thought with\nannoyance. I barely get to see him.\nHer door opened. Vin was pleased that her instincts were still keen\nenough that she immediately grew tense, reaching for her daggers. Her\npained side protested the sudden motion.\nNobody entered.\nVin frowned, still tense, until a canine head popped up over the top of\nher footboard. \"Mistress?\" said a familiar, half growl of a voice.\n\"OreSeur?\" Vin said. \"You're wearing another dog's body!\""

Tindwyl had been wrong: Vin\ncouldn't be both Mistborn and lady.

Demoux or Dockson, likely. Maybe I should just\norder them both taken and held for a time? Would Elend even do such a\nthing?\nOreSeur was watching her, apparently noting her frustration. Finally,\nhe sighed. \"Perhaps there are some things I can speak of, Mistress, if I am\ncareful.

But, if\nhe'd truly created a completely new species, then there had to have been\nsome divinity in him.\nThe power of the Well of Ascension, she thought. He took it for himself\n—but it didn't last. It must have run out, and quickly. Otherwise, why would\nhe have needed armies to conquer?\nAn initial burst of power, the ability to create, to change—perhaps to\nsave. He'd pushed back the mists, and in the process he'd somehow made\nthe ash begin to fall and the sky turn red. He'd created the kandra to serve\nhim—and probably the koloss, too. He might even have created\nAllomancers themselves.\nAnd after that, he had returned to being a normal man. Mostly. The\nLord Ruler had still held an inordinate amount of power for an Allomancer,\nand had managed to keep control of his creations—and he had somehow\nkept the mists from killing.\nUntil Vin had slain him. Then the koloss had begun to rampage, and\nthe mists had returned. The kandra hadn't been beneath his control at that\ntime, so they remained as they were. But, he built into them a method of\ncontrol, should he need it. A way to make the kandra serve him. . ..\nVin closed her eyes, and quested out lightly with her Allomantic\nsenses. OreSeur had said that kandra couldn't be affected by Allomancy—\nbut she knew something else about the Lord Ruler, something that had\ndistinguished him from other Allomancers. His inordinate power had\nallowed him to do things he shouldn't have been able to.\nThings like pierce copperclouds, and affect metals inside of a person's\nbody. Maybe that was how he controlled the kandra, the thing that OreSeur\nwas speaking of. The reason they feared Mistborn.\nNot because Mistborn could kill them, but because Mistborn could do\nsomething else. Enslave them, somehow. Tentatively, testing what he'd said\nearlier, Vin reached out with a Soothing and touched OreSeur's emotions.\nNothing happened.\nI can do some of the same things as the Lord Ruler, she thought. I can\npierce copperclouds. Perhaps, if I just Push harder. . .\nShe focused, and Pushed on his emotions with a powerful Soothing.\nAgain, nothing happened. Just as he'd told her.

He had discovered Alendi, a man\nhe began to think—through his studies—might be the Hero of Ages, a\nfigure from Terris prophecy. Alendi had listened to him, and had become a\npolitical leader. He had conquered much of the world, then traveled north to\nthe Well of Ascension. By then, however, Kwaan had apparently changed\nhis mind about Alendi—and had tried to stop him from getting to the Well.\nIt fit together. Even though the logbook author never mentioned his\nown name, it was obvious that he was Alendi. \"It is a very safe assumption,\nI think,\" Sazed said. \"The logbook even speaks of Kwaan, and the falling-\nout they had.\"\nThey sat beside each other in Sazed's rooms.

The rings running down the sides of\nher ears alternated in color—a gold or copper followed by a tin or iron. It\nwas such a simple thing, but there was a beauty to it.\n\"Sazed?\"\nSazed started. \"I apologize,\" he said, then turned back to his reading.\n\"'I am also afraid, however, that all I have known—that my story—will be\nforgotten. I am afraid for the world that may come. Afraid because my plans\nfailed. Afraid of a doom brought by the Deepness.'\"\n\"Wait,\" Tindwyl said. \"Why did he fear that?\"\n\"Why would he not?\" Sazed asked. \"The Deepness—which we assume\nis the mist—was killing his people. Without sunlight, their crops would not\ngrow, and their animals could not graze.\"\n\"But, if Kwaan feared the Deepness, then he should not have opposed\nAlendi,\" Tindwyl said. \"He was climbing to the Well of Ascension to defeat\nthe Deepness.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said. \"But by then, Kwaan was convinced that Alendi\nwasn't the Hero of Ages.\"\n\"But why would that matter?\" Tindwyl said. \"It didn't take a specific\nperson to stop the mists—Rashek's success proves that. Here, skip to the\nend. Read that passage about Rashek.\"\n\"'I have a young nephew, one Rashek,'\" Sazed read. \"'He hates all of\nKhlennium with the passion of envious youth. He hates Alendi even more\nacutely—though the two have never met—for Rashek feels betrayed that\none of our oppressors should have been chosen as the Hero of Ages.\n\"'Alendi will need guides through the Terris mountains. I have charged\nRashek with making certain that he and his trusted friends are chosen as\nthose guides. Rashek is to try and lead Alendi in the wrong direction, to\ndiscourage him or otherwise foil his quest. Alendi won't know that he has\nbeen deceived.\n\"'If Rashek fails to lead Alendi astray, then I have instructed the lad to\nkill my former friend. It is a distant hope. Alendi has survived assassins,\nwars, and catastrophes. And yet, I hope that in the frozen mountains of\nTerris, he may finally be exposed. I hope for a miracle.\n\"'Alendi must not reach the Well of Ascension. He must not take the\npower for himself.'\"\nTindwyl sat back, frowning.\n\"What?\"\n\"Something is wrong there, I think,\" she said. \"But I cannot tell you\nprecisely what.\"\nSazed scanned the text again. \"Let us break it down to simple\nstatements, then. Rashek—the man who became the Lord Ruler—was\nKwaan's nephew.\"\n\"Yes,\" Tindwyl said."

But, tell\nme, Sazed. When you read Alendi's logbook, did you get the impression\nthat he was the type who would take that power for himself?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"Actually, the opposite. That is part of what\nmade the logbook so confusing—we couldn't figure out why the man\nrepresented within would have done as we assumed he must have. I think\nthat is part of what eventually led Vin to guess that the Lord Ruler wasn't\nAlendi at all, but Rashek, his packman.\"\n\"And Kwaan says that he knew Alendi well,\" Tindwyl said. \"In fact, in\nthis very rubbing, he compliments the man on several occasions. Calls him\na good person, I believe.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said, finding the passage. \"'He is a good man—despite it\nall, he is a good man. A sacrificing man. In truth, all of his actions—all of\nthe deaths, destructions, and pains that he has caused—have hurt him\ndeeply.'\"\n\"So, Kwaan knew Alendi well,\" Tindwyl said. \"And thought highly of\nhim. He also, presumably, knew his nephew Rashek well. Do you see my\nproblem?\"\nSazed nodded slowly. \"Why send a man of wild temperament, one\nwhose motivations are based on envy and hatred, to kill a man you thought\nto be good and of worthy temperament? It does seem an odd choice.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Tindwyl said, resting her arms on the table.\n\"But,\" Sazed said, \"Kwaan says right here that he 'doubts that if Alendi\nreaches the Well of Ascension, he will take the power and then—in the\nname of the greater good—give it up.'\"\nTindwyl shook her head. \"It doesn't make sense, Sazed.

Kwaan practically set up Rashek to take the power\n—if letting Alendi take the power was such a concern, wouldn't he have\nfeared that Rashek might do the same?\"\n\"Perhaps we simply see things with the clarity of those regarding\nevents that have already occurred,\" Sazed said.\nTindwyl shook her head. \"We're missing something, Sazed.

He\nwas the one who discovered Alendi, and was the first to tout him as the\nHero of Ages. Why would he turn against him as he did?\"\nSazed nodded, flipping through his translation of the rubbing. Kwaan\nhad gained much notoriety by discovering the Hero. He found the place he\nwas looking for.\nThere was a place for me in the lore of the Anticipation, the text read. I\nthought myself the Announcer, the prophet foretold to discover the Hero of\nAges. Renouncing Alendi then would have been to renounce my new\nposition, my acceptance, by the others.\n\"Something dramatic must have happened,\" Tindwyl said. \"Something\nthat would make him turn against his friend, the source of his own fame.\nSomething that pricked his conscience so sharply that he was willing to risk\nopposing the most powerful monarch in the land. Something so frightening\nthat he took a ridiculous chance by sending this Rashek on an assassination\nmission.\"\nSazed leafed through his notes. \"He fears both the Deepness and what\nwould happen if Alendi took the power. Yet, he cannot seem to decide\nwhich one is the greater threat, and neither seems more present in the\nnarrative than the other. Yes, I can see the problem here.

Perhaps one army or another would enter by the\nblessing of the Assembly, but the other would still strike. The walls of\nLuthadel would run red when the siege finally ended.\nAnd he feared that end was coming very, very soon.\n\"You are right,\" he said, turning back to the notes on his desktop. \"We\nmust continue to study.

This was not a task they\ncould complete in the time they had. Deciphering the meaning of the\nrubbing, comparing it to the logbook, and relating it to the context of the\nperiod was a scholarly undertaking that would require the determined work\nof years.\nKeepers had much knowledge—but in this case, it was almost too\nmuch. They had been gathering and transmitting records, stories, myths,\nand legends for so long that it took years for one Keeper to recite the\ncollected works to a new initiate.\nFortunately, included with the mass of information were indexes and\nsummaries created by the Keepers. On top of this came the notes and\npersonal indexes each individual Keeper made. And yet, these only helped\nthe Keeper understand just how much information he had. Sazed himself\nhad spent his life reading, memorizing, and indexing religions. Each night,\nbefore he slept, he read some portion of a note or story. He was probably\nthe world's foremost scholar on pre-Ascension religions, and yet he felt as if\nhe knew so little.\nCompounding all of that was the inherent unreliability of their\ninformation. A great deal of it came from the mouths of simple people,\ndoing their best to remember what their lives had once been like—or, more\noften, what the lives of their grandparents had once been like. The Keepers\nhadn't been founded until late in the second century of the Lord Ruler's\nreign. By then, many religions had already been wiped out in their pure\nforms.\nSazed closed his eyes, dumped another index from a coppermind into\nhis head, then began to search it. There wasn't much time, true, but Tindwyl\nand he were Keepers. They were accustomed to beginning tasks that others\nwould have to finish.\nElend Venture, once king of the Central Dominance, stood on the\nbalcony of his keep, overlooking the vast city of Luthadel. Though the first\nsnows had yet to fall, the weather had grown cold. He wore an overcloak,\ntied at the front, but it didn't protect his face. A chill tingled his cheeks as a\nwind blew across him, whipping at his cloak. Smoke rose from chimneys,\ngathering like an ominous shadow above the city before rising up to meld\nwith the ashen red sky.\nFor every house that produced smoke, there were two that did not.\nMany of those were probably deserted; the city held nowhere near the\npopulation it once had. However, he knew that many of those smokeless\nhouses were still inhabited. Inhabited, and freezing.\nI should have been able to do more for them, Elend thought, eyes open\nto the piercing cold wind. I should have found a way to get more coal; I\nshould have managed to provide for them all.\nIt was humbling, even depressing, to admit that the Lord Ruler had\ndone better than Elend himself. Despite being a heartless tyrant, the Lord\nRuler had at least kept a significant portion of the population from starving\nor freezing. He had kept armies in check, and had kept crime at a\nmanageable level.\nTo the northeast, the koloss army waited. It had sent no emissaries to"

It had sent no emissaries to\nthe city, but it was more frightening than either Cett's or Straff's armies. The\ncold wouldn't scare away its occupants; despite their bare skin, they\napparently took little notice of weather changes. This final army was the\nmost disturbing of the three—more dangerous, more unpredictable, and\nimpossible to deal with. Koloss did not bargain.\nWe haven't been paying enough attention to that threat, he thought as\nhe stood on the balcony. There's just been so much to do, so much to worry\nabout, that we couldn't focus on an army that might be as dangerous to our\nenemies as it is to us.\nIt was looking less and less likely that the koloss would attack Cett or\nStraff. Apparently, Jastes was enough in control to keep them waiting to\ntake a shot at Luthadel itself.\n\"My lord,\" said a voice from behind. \"Please, come back in. That's a\nfell wind. No use killing yourself from a chill.\"\nElend turned back. Captain Demoux stood dutifully in the room, along\nwith another bodyguard. In the aftermath of the assassination attempt, Ham\nhad insisted that Elend go about guarded. Elend hadn't complained, though\nhe knew there was little reason for caution anymore. Straff wouldn't want to\nkill him now that he wasn't king.\nSo earnest, Elend thought, studying Demoux's face. Why do I find him\nyouthful? We're nearly the same age.\n\"Very well,\" Elend said, turning and striding into the room. As\nDemoux closed the balcony doors, Elend removed his cloak. The suit below\nfelt wrong on him. Sloppy, even though he had ordered it cleaned and\npressed. The vest was too tight—his practice with the sword was slowly\nmodifying his body—while the coat hung loosely.\n\"Demoux,\" Elend said. \"When is your next Survivor rally?\"\n\"Tonight, my lord.\"\nElend nodded. He'd feared that; it would be a cold night.\n\"My lord,\" Demoux said, \"do you still intend to come?\"\n\"Of course,\" Elend said. \"I gave my word that I would join with your\ncause.\"\n\"That was before you lost the vote, my lord.\"\n\"That is immaterial,\" Elend said. \"I am joining your movement\nbecause it is important to the skaa, Demoux, and I want to understand the\nwill of my. . .of the people. I promised you dedication—and you shall have\nit.\"\nDemoux seemed a bit confused, but spoke no further. Elend eyed his\ndesk, considering some studying, but found it hard to motivate himself in\nthe chill room. Instead, he pushed open the door and strode out into the\nhallway. His guards followed.\nHe stopped himself from turning toward Vin's rooms. She needed her\nrest, and it didn't do her much good to have him peeking in every half hour\nto check on her.

Now he used them for another reason; the corridors\nprovided a perfect place for extended walking. He didn't point himself in\nany particular direction, he just moved, working out his frustration to the\nbeating of his own footsteps.\nI can't fix the city's problems, he told himself. I have to let Penrod\nhandle that—he's the one the people want.\nThat should have made things easier for Elend. It let him focus on his\nown survival, not to mention let him spend time revitalizing his relationship\nwith Vin. She, however, seemed different lately. Elend tried to tell himself it\nwas just her injury, but he sensed something deeper. Something in the way\nshe looked at him, something in the way she reacted to his affection. And,\ndespite himself, he could think of only one thing that had changed.\nHe was no longer king.\nVin was not shallow. She had shown him nothing but devotion and\nlove during their two years together. And yet, how could she not react—\neven if unconsciously—to his colossal failure? During the assassination\nattempt, he had watched her fight. Really watched her fight, for the first\ntime. Until that day, he hadn't realized just how amazing she was. She\nwasn't just a warrior, and she wasn't just an Allomancer. She was a force,\nlike thunder or wind. The way she had killed that last man, smashing his\nhead with her own. . .\nHow could she love a man like me? he thought. I couldn't even hold my\nthrone. I wrote the very laws that deposed me.\nHe sighed, continuing to walk. He felt like he should be scrambling,\ntrying to figure out a way to convince Vin that he was worthy of her. But\nthat would just make him seem more incompetent. There was no correcting\npast mistakes, especially since he could see no real \"mistakes\" he had made.\nHe had done the best he could, and that had proven insufficient.\nHe paused at an intersection. Once, a relaxing dip into a book would\nhave been enough to calm him. Now he felt nervous. Tense. A little. . .like\nhe assumed Vin usually felt.\nMaybe I could learn from her, he thought. What would Vin do in my\nsituation? She certainly wouldn't just wander around, brooding and feeling\nsorry for herself. Elend frowned, looking down a hallway lighted by\nflickering oil lamps, only half of them lit. Then he took off, waking with a\ndetermined stride toward a particular set of rooms.\nHe knocked quietly, and got no response. Finally, he poked his head in.\nSazed and Tindwyl sat quietly before a desk piled high with scraps of paper\nand ledgers. They both sat staring, as if at nothing, their eyes bearing the\nglazedover look of someone who had been stunned. Sazed's hand rested on\nthe table.

It is his right to follow his conscience, then\ntrust in providence to fill in the holes caused by the conflict between\nmorality and logic.\"\nProvidence. \"You mean God,\" Elend said.\n\"I do.\"\nElend shook his head. \"What is God, Sazed, but a device used by\nobligators?\"\n\"Why do you make the choices that you do, Elend Venture?\"\n\"Because they're right,\" Elend said.\n\"And why are these things right?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Elend said with a sigh, leaning back. He caught a\ndisapproving glance from Tindwyl at his posture, but he ignored her. He\nwasn't king; he could slouch if he wanted to. \"You talk of God, Sazed, but\ndon't you preach of a hundred different religions?\"\n\"Three hundred, actually,\" Sazed said.\n\"Well, which one do you believe?\" Elend asked.\n\"I believe them all.\"\nElend shook his head. \"That doesn't make sense. You've only pitched a\nhalf-dozen to me, but I can already see that they're incompatible.\"\n\"It is not my position to judge truth, Lord Venture,\" Sazed said,\nsmiling. \"I simply carry it.\"\nElend sighed. Priests. . .he thought. Sometimes, talking to Sazed is like\ntalking to an obligator.\n\"Elend,\" Tindwyl said, her tone softening. \"I think you handled this\nsituation in the wrong way. However, Sazed does have a point. You were\ntrue to your own convictions, and that is a regal attribute, I think.\"\n\"And what should I do now?\" he asked.\n\"Whatever you wish,\" Tindwyl said. \"It was never my place to tell you\nwhat to do. I simply gave you knowledge of what men in your place did in\nthe past.\"\n\"And what would they have done?\" Elend asked. \"These great leaders\nof yours, how would they have reacted to my situation?\""

What do you think makes a man a good king? he\nhad once asked of Tindwyl. Trust, she had replied. A good king is one who\nis trusted by his people—and one who deserves that trust.\nElend stood up. \"Thank you, Tindwyl,\" he said.\nTindwyl frowned in confusion, then turned to Sazed. He looked up and\nmet Elend's eyes, cocking his head slightly. Then he smiled. \"Come,\nTindwyl,\" he said. \"We should return to our studies. His Majesty has work\nto do, I think.\"\nTindwyl continued to frown as Elend left the room. His guards\nfollowed behind as he quickly strode down the hallway.\nI won't go back to the way I was, Elend thought. I won't continue to\nfret and worry. Tindwyl taught me better than that, even if she never really\nunderstood me.\nElend arrived at his rooms a few moments later. He stalked directly in,\nthen opened his closet. The clothing Tindwyl had chosen for him—the\nclothing of a king—waited inside.\nSome of you may know of my fabled memory. It is true; I need not a\nFeruchemist's metalmind to memorize a sheet of words in an instant.\n42\n\"GOOD,\" ELEND SAID, USING A charcoal stick to circle another\nsection on the city map before him. \"What about here?\"\nDemoux scratched his chin. \"Grainfield? That's a nobleman's\nneighborhood, my lord.\"\n\"It used to be,\" Elend said. \"Grainfield was filled with cousin houses to\nthe Ventures. When my father pulled out of the city, so did most of them.\"\n\"Then we'll probably find the homes filled with skaa transients, I'd\nguess.\"\nElend nodded. \"Move them out.\"\n\"Excuse me, my lord?\" Demoux said. The two stood in Keep Venture's\nlarge carriage landing. Soldiers moved in a bustle through the spacious\nroom. Many of them didn't wear uniforms; they weren't on official city\nbusiness. Elend was no longer king, but they had still come at his request.\nThat said something, at least.\n\"We need to move the skaa out of those homes,\" Elend continued.\n\"Noblemen's houses are mostly stone mansions with a lot of small rooms.\nThey're extremely hard to heat, requiring a separate hearth or a stove for\nevery room. The skaa tenements are depressing, but they have massive\nhearths and open rooms.\"\nDemoux nodded slowly.\n\"The Lord Ruler couldn't have his workers freezing,\" Elend said.\n\"Those tenements are the best way to efficiently look after a large\npopulation of people with limited resources.\"\n\"I understand, my lord,\" Demoux said."

If a\nfamily wants to stay in their pilfered aristocratic house, let them. Just make\ncertain that they know there's an alternative to freezing.\"\nDemoux nodded, then moved over to pass on the commands. Elend\nturned as a messenger arrived. The man had to weave his way through an\norganized jumble of soldiers receiving orders and making plans.\nElend nodded to the newcomer. \"You're on the demolitions scout\ngroup, correct?\"\nThe man nodded as he bowed. He wasn't in uniform; he was a soldier,\nnot one of Elend's guards. He was a younger man, with a square jaw,\nbalding head, and honest smile.\n\"Don't I know you?\" Elend said.\n\"I helped you a year ago, my lord,\" the man said. \"I led you into the\nLord Ruler's palace to help rescue Lady Vin. . ..\"\n\"Goradel,\" Elend said, remembering. \"You used to be in the Lord\nRuler's personal guard.\"\nThe man nodded. \"I joined up in your army after that day. Seemed like\nthe thing to do.\"\nElend smiled. \"Not my army anymore, Goradel, but I do appreciate\nyou coming to help us today. What's your report?\"\n\"You were right, my lord,\" Goradel said, \"the skaa have already robbed\nthe empty homes for furniture. But, not many thought of the walls. A good\nhalf of the abandoned mansions have wooden walls on the inside, and a lot\nof the tenements were made of wood. Most all of them have wooden roofs.\"\n\"Good,\" Elend said. He surveyed the gathering mass of men. He hadn't\ntold them his plans; he'd simply asked for volunteers to help him with some\nmanual labor. He hadn't expected the response to number in the hundreds.\n\"It looks like we're gathering quite a group, my lord,\" Demoux said,\nrejoining Elend.\nElend nodded, giving leave for Goradel to withdraw. \"We'll be able to\ntry an even more ambitious project than I'd planned.\"\n\"My lord,\" Demoux said. \"Are you certain you want to start tearing the\ncity down around ourselves?\"\n\"We either lose buildings or we lose people, Demoux,\" Elend said.\n\"The buildings go.\"\n\"And if the king tries to stop us?\"\n\"Then we obey,\" Elend said. \"But I don't think Lord Penrod will\nobject. He's too busy trying to get a bill through the Assembly that hands\nthe city over to my father. Besides, it's probably better for him to have these\nmen here, working, than it is to have them sitting and worrying in the\nbarracks.\"\nDemoux fell silent. Elend did as well; both knew how precarious their\nposition was. Only a short time had passed since the assassination attempt\nand the transfer of power, and the city was in shock. Cett was still holed up\ninside of Keep Hasting, and his armies had moved into position to attack"

Luthadel was like a man with a knife pressed very closely to his\nthroat. Each breath cut the skin.\nI can't do much about that now, Elend thought. I have to make certain\nthe people don't freeze these next few nights. He could feel the bitter cold,\ndespite the daylight, his cloak, and the shelter. There were a lot of people in\nLuthadel, but if he could get enough men tearing down enough buildings,\nhe just might be able to do some good.\n\"My lord!\"\nElend turned as a short man with a drooping mustache approached.\n\"Ah, Felt,\" he said. \"You have news?\" The man was working on the\npoisoned-food problem—specifically how the city was being breached.\nThe scout nodded. \"I do indeed, my lord. We interrogated the refugees\nwith a Rioter, and we came up dry. Then, however, I started thinking. The\nrefugees seemed too obvious to me. Strangers in the city? Of course they'd\nbe the first ones we'd suspect. I figured, with how much has been going\nwrong with the wells and the food and the like, someone has to be sneaking\nin and out of the city.\"\nElend nodded. They'd been watching Cett's soldiers inside Keep\nHasting very carefully, and none of them was responsible. Straff's Mistborn\nwas still a possibility, but Vin had never believed that he was behind the\npoisoning. Elend hoped that the trail—if it could be found—would lead\nback to someone in his own palace, hopefully revealing who on his serving\nstaff had been replaced by a kandra.\n\"Well?\" Elend asked.\n\"I interrogated the people who run passwalls,\" Felt continued. \"I don't\nthink they're to blame.\"\n\"Passwalls?\"\nFelt nodded. \"Covert passages out of the city. Tunnels or the like.\"\n\"Such things exist?\" Elend asked with surprise.\n\"Of course, my lord,\" Felt said. \"Moving between cities was very\ndifficult for skaa thieves during the Lord Ruler's reign. Everyone who\nentered Luthadel was subject to interview and interrogation. So, ways to get\ninto the city covertly were very prevalent. Most of those have shut down—\nthe ones who used to lower people up and down by ropes over the walls. A\nfew are still running, but I don't think they are letting the spies in. Once that\nfirst well was poisoned, the passwalls all got paranoid that you'd come after\nthem. Since then, they've only been letting people out of the city—ones\nwho want to run from the besieged city and the like.\"\nElend frowned. He wasn't certain what he thought of the fact that\npeople were disobeying his order that the gates be shut, with no passage\nout.\n\"Next,\" Felt said, \"I tried the river.\"\n\"We thought of that,\" Elend said. \"The grates covering the water are all\nsecure.\"\nFelt smiled. \"That they are. I sent some men down under the water to\nsearch about, and we found several locks down below, keeping the river\ngrates in place.\"\n\"What?\""

That way, they could swim in\nand out at their leisure.\"\nElend raised an eyebrow.\n\"You want us to replace the grates?\" Felt asked.\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"No, just replace those locks with new ones, then\npost men to watch. Next time those prisoners try and get into the city, I\nwant them to find themselves trapped.\"\nFelt nodded, retreating with a happy smile on his face. His talents as a\nspy hadn't been put to much good use lately, and he seemed to be enjoying\nthe tasks Elend was giving him. Elend made a mental note to think about\nputting Felt to work on locating the kandra spy—assuming, of course, that\nFelt himself wasn't the spy.\n\"My lord,\" Demoux said, approaching. \"I think I might be able to offer\na second opinion on how the poisonings are occurring.\"\nElend turned. \"Oh?\"\nDemoux nodded, waving for a man to approach from the side of the\nroom. He was younger, perhaps eighteen, and had the dirty face and\nclothing of a skaa worker.\n\"This is Larn,\" Demoux said. \"A member of my congregation.\"\nThe young man bowed to Elend, posture nervous.\n\"You may speak, Larn,\" Demoux said. \"Tell Lord Venture what you\nsaw.\"\n\"Well, my lord,\" the young man said. \"I tried to go tell this to the king.\nThe new king, I mean.\" He flushed, embarrassed.\n\"It's all right,\" Elend said. \"Continue.\"\n\"Well, the men there turned me away. Said the king didn't have time\nfor me. So, I came to Lord Demoux. I figured he might believe me.\"\n\"About what?\" Elend asked.\n\"Inquisitor, my lord,\" the man said quietly. \"I saw one in the city.\"\nElend felt a chill. \"You're sure?\"\nThe young man nodded. \"I've lived in Luthadel all my life, my lord.\nWatched executions a number of times. I'd recognize one of those monsters,\nsure I would. I saw him. Spikes through the eyes, tall and robed, slinking\nabout at night. Near the center squares of the city. I promise you.\"\nElend shared a look with Demoux.\n\"He's not the only one, my lord,\" Demoux said quietly. \"Some other\nmembers of my congregation claimed to have seen an Inquisitor hanging\naround Kredik Shaw. I dismissed the first few, but Larn, he's trustworthy. If\nhe said he saw something, he did. Eyes nearly as good as a Tineye, that\none.\"\nElend nodded slowly, and ordered a patrol from his personal guard to\nkeep watch in the area indicated. After that, he turned his attention back to\nthe wood-gathering effort. He gave the orders, organizing the men into\nteams, sending some to begin working, others to gather recruits. Without\nfuel, many of the city's forges had shut down, and the workers were idle."

Elend\nknew that determination, that firmness of eye and arm. It came from the\nsatisfaction of doing something, of not just sitting around and waiting for\nfate—or kings—to act.\nElend turned back to the map, making a few notations. From the\ncorner of his eye, he saw Ham saunter in. \"So this is where they all went!\"\nHam said. \"The sparring grounds are empty.\"\nElend looked up, smiling.\n\"You're back to the uniform, then?\" Ham asked.\nElend glanced down at his white outfit. Designed to stand out, to set\nhim apart from a city stained by ash. \"Yes.\"\n\"Too bad,\" Ham said with a sigh. \"Nobody should have to wear a\nuniform.\"\nElend raised an eyebrow. In the face of undeniable winter, Ham had\nfinally taken to wearing a shirt beneath his vest. He wore no cloak or coat,\nhowever.\nElend turned back to the map. \"The clothing suits me,\" he said. \"It just\nfeels right. Anyway, that vest of yours is as much a uniform as this is.\"\n\"No it's not.\"\n\"Oh?\" Elend asked. \"Nothing screams Thug like a man who goes about\nin the winter without a coat, Ham. You've used your clothing to change how\npeople react to you, to let them know who you are and what you represent\n—which is essentially what a uniform does.\"\nHam paused. \"That's an interesting way of looking at it.\"\n\"What?\" Elend said. \"You never argued about something like this with\nBreeze?\"\nHam shook his head as he turned to look over the groups of men,\nlistening to the men Elend had appointed to give orders.\nHe's changed, Elend thought. Running this city, dealing with all of this,\nit's even changed him. The Thug was more solemn, now—more focused. Of\ncourse, he had even more stake in the city's safety than the rest of the crew.\nIt was sometimes hard to remember that the free-spirited Thug was a family\nman. Ham tended to not talk much about Mardra or his two children. Elend\nsuspected it was habit; Ham had spent much of his marriage living apart\nfrom his family in order to keep them safe.\nThis whole city is my family, Elend thought, watching the soldiers\nleave to do their work. Some might have thought something as simple as\ngathering firewood to be a mundane task, of little relevance in a city\nthreatened by three armies. However, Elend knew that the freezing skaa\npeople would receive the fuel with as much appreciation as they would\nsalvation from the armies.\nThe truth was that Elend felt a little like his soldiers did. He felt a\nsatisfaction—a thrill even—from doing something, anything, to help.\n\"What if Cett's attack comes?\" Ham said, still looking over the\nsoldiers. \"A good portion of the army will be out scattered through the city.\"\n\"Even if we have a thousand men in my teams, that's not much of a\ndent in our forces.

We'll never take him—\nwe'd have to pull too many men away from the city defenses, leaving\nourselves exposed. The only thing he really has to worry about is my father.\n. .\"\nElend trailed off.\n\"What?\" Ham said.\n\"That's why Cett is here,\" Elend said, blinking in surprise. \"Don't you\nsee? He intentionally left himself without options. If Straff attacks, Cett's\narmies will end up fighting alongside our own. He's locked in his fate with\nours.\"\nHam frowned. \"Seems like a pretty desperate move.\"\nElend nodded, thinking back to his meeting with Cett. \"'Desperate,'\" he\nsaid. \"That's a good word. Cett is desperate for some reason—one I haven't\nbeen able to figure out. Anyway, by putting himself in here, he sides with us\nagainst Straff—whether we want the alliance or not.\"\n\"But, what if the Assembly gives the city to Straff? If our men join\nwith him and attack Cett?\"\n\"That's the gamble he took,\" Elend said. Cett never intended to be able\nto walk away from the confrontation here in Luthadel. He intends to take\nthe city or be destroyed.\nHe is waiting, hoping Straff will attack, worrying that we'll just give\ninto him. But neither can happen as long as Straff is afraid of Vin. A three-\nway standoff. With the koloss as a fourth element that nobody can predict.\nSomeone needed to do something to tip the scales. \"Demoux,\" Elend\nsaid. \"Are you ready to take over here?\"\nCaptain Demoux looked over, nodding.\nElend turned to Ham. \"I have a question for you, Ham.\"\nHam raised an eyebrow.\n\"How insane are you feeling at the moment?\nElend led his horse out of the tunnel into the scraggly landscape\noutside of Luthadel. He turned, craning to look up at the wall. Hopefully,\nthe soldiers there had gotten his message, and wouldn't mistake him for a\nspy or a scout of one of the enemy armies. He'd rather not end up in\nTindwyl's histories as the ex-king who'd died by an arrow from one of his\nown men.\nHam led a small, grizzled woman from the tunnel. As Elend had\nguessed, Ham had easily found a suitable passwall to get them out of the\ncity.\n\"Well, there you go,\" said the elderly woman, resting on her cane.\n\"Thank you, good woman,\" Elend said. \"You have served your\ndominance well this day.\"\nThe woman snorted, raising an eyebrow—though, from what Elend\ncould tell, she was quite nearly blind. Elend smiled, pulling out a pouch and\nhanding it to her. She reached into it with gnarled, but surprisingly\ndexterous, fingers and counted out the contents. \"Three extra?\"\n\"To pay you to leave a scout here,\" Elend said. \"To watch for our\nreturn.\""

Lord\nRuler knows, I have enough of them.\"\nHam watched her go, a spark of fondness in his eyes.\n\"How long have you known about this place?\" Elend asked, watching\nas a couple of burly men pulled closed the hidden section of stone. Half\nburrowed, half cut from the wall's stones themselves, the tunnel was a\nremarkable feat. Even after hearing about the existence of such things from\nFelt earlier, it was still a shock to travel through one hidden not a few\nminutes' ride from Keep Venture itself.\nHam turned back to him as the false wall snapped shut. \"Oh, I've\nknown of this for years and years,\" he said. \"Granny Hilde used to give me\nsweets when I was a kid. Of course, that was really just a cheap way of\ngetting some quiet—yet well-targeted—publicity for her passwall. When I\nwas grown, I used to use this to sneak Mardra and the kids in and out of the\ncity when they came to visit.\"\n\"Wait,\" Elend said. \"You grew up in Luthadel?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"On the streets, like Vin?\"\nHam shook his head. \"Not really like Vin,\" he said in a subdued voice,\nscanning the wall. \"I don't really think anyone grew up like Vin. I had skaa\nparents—my grandfather was the nobleman. I was involved with the\nunderground, but I had my parents for a good portion of my childhood.\nBesides, I was a boy—and a large one.\" He turned toward Elend. \"I suspect\nthat makes a big difference.\"\nElend nodded.\n\"You're not going to shut this place down, are you?\" Ham asked.\nElend turned with shock. \"Why would I?\"\nHam shrugged. \"It doesn't exactly seem like the kind of honest\nenterprise that you would approve of. There are probably people fleeing\nfrom the city nightly through this hole. Granny Hilde is known to take coin\nand not ask questions—even if she does grumble at you a bit.\"\nHam did have a point. Probably why he didn't tell me about the place\nuntil I specifically asked. His friends walked a fine line, close to their old\nties with the underground, yet working hard to build up the government\nthey'd sacrificed so much to create.\n\"I'm not king,\" Elend said, leading his horse away from the city. \"What\nGranny Hilde does isn't any of my business.\"\nHam moved up beside him, looking relieved. Elend could see that\nrelief dissipate, however, as the reality of what they were doing settled in. \"I\ndon't like this, El.\"\nThey stopped walking as Elend mounted. \"Neither do I.\"\nHam took a deep breath, then nodded.\nMy old nobleman friends would have tried to talk me out of this, Elend"

They expect their leaders to take irrational\nrisks.\n\"I'll go with you,\" Ham said.\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"It won't make a difference. Stay here, wait to see if\nI get back.

An army who had eaten the foliage to the ground in a wide swath\naround them. Koloss.\nSweat made the reins slick in Elend's hands. This was different from\nbefore, when he'd gone into Straff's army and Cett's keep. This time he was\nalone. Vin couldn't get him out if things went bad; she was still recovering\nfrom her wounds, and nobody knew what Elend was doing but Ham.\nWhat do I owe the people of this city? Elend thought. They rejected me.\nWhy do I still insist on trying to protect them?\n\"I recognize that look, El,\" Ham said. \"Let's go back.\"\nElend closed his eyes, letting out a quiet sigh. Then he snapped his\neyes open and kicked his horse into a gallop.\nIt had been years since he'd seen koloss, and that experience had come\nonly at his father's insistence. Straff hadn't trusted the creatures, and had\nnever liked having garrisons of them in the Northern Dominance, one just a\nfew days' march from his home city of Urteau. Those koloss had been a\nreminder, a warning, from the Lord Ruler.\nElend rode his horse hard, as if using its momentum to bolster his own\nwill. Aside from one brief visit to the Urteau koloss garrison, everything he\nknew of the creatures came from books—but Tindwyl's instruction had\nweakened his once absolute, and slightly naive, trust in his learning.\nIt will have to be enough, Elend thought as he approached the camp.\nHe gritted his teeth, slowing his animal as he approached a wandering\nsquad of Koloss.\nIt was as he remembered. One large creature—its skin revoltingly split\nand cracked by stretch marks—led a few medium-sized beasts, whose\nbleeding rips were only beginning to appear at the corners of their mouths\nand the edges of their eyes. A smattering of smaller creatures—their baggy\nskin loose and sagging beneath their eyes and arms—accompanied their\nbetters.\nElend reined in his horse, trotting it over to the largest beast. \"Take me\nto Jastes.\"\n\"Get off your horse,\" the koloss said.\nElend looked the creature directly in the eyes.

It bore a\nrip from one eye to the other, above the nose, a secondary rip curving down\nto one of the nostrils. The nose itself was pulled so tight it was twisted and\nflattened, held to the bone a few inches off-center.\nThis was the moment. The books said the creature would either do as\ncommanded or simply attack him. Elend sat tensely.\n\"Come,\" the koloss snapped, turning to walk back toward the camp.\nThe rest of the creatures surrounded Elend's horse, and the beast shuffled\nnervously. Elend kept a tight hold on his reins and nudged the animal\nforward. It responded skittishly.\nHe should have felt good at his small victory, but his tension only\nincreased. They moved forward into the koloss camp. It was like being\nswallowed. Like letting a rockslide collapse around you. Koloss looked up\nas he passed, watching him with their red, emotionless eyes. Many others\njust stood silently around their cooking fires, unresponsive, like men who\nhad been born dull-minded and witless.\nOthers fought. They killed each other, wrestling on the ground before\ntheir uncaring companions. No philosopher, scientist, or scholar had been\nable to determine exactly what set off a koloss. Greed seemed a good\nmotivation. Yet, they would sometimes attack when there was plenty of\nfood, killing a companion for his hunk of beef. Pain was another good\nmotivator, apparently, as was a challenge to authority. Carnal, visceral\nreasons. And yet, there seemed to be times when they attacked without any\ncause or reason.\nAnd after fighting, they would explain themselves in calm tones, as if\ntheir actions were perfectly rational. Elend shivered as he heard yells,\ntelling himself that he would probably be all right until he reached Jastes.\nKoloss usually just attacked each other.\nUnless they got into a blood frenzy.\nHe pushed that thought away, instead focusing on the things that Sazed\nhad mentioned about his trip into the koloss camp. The creatures wore the\nwide, brutish iron swords that Sazed had described. The bigger the koloss,\nthe bigger the weapon. When a koloss reached a size where he thought he\nneeded a larger sword, he had only two choices: find one that had been\ndiscarded, or kill someone and take theirs. A koloss population could often\nbe crudely controlled by increasing or decreasing the number of swords\navailable to the group.\nNone of the scholars knew how the creatures bred.\nAs Sazed had explained, these koloss also had strange little pouches\ntied to their sword straps. What are they? Elend thought. Sazed said he saw\nthe largest koloss carrying three or four. But that one leading my group has\nalmost twenty. Even the small koloss in Elend's group had three pouches.\nThat's the difference, he thought. Whatever is in those pouches, could\nit be the way Jastes controls the creatures?\nThere was no way to know, save begging one of the pouches off a\nkoloss—and he doubted they would let them go.\nAs he walked, he noticed another oddity: some of the koloss were"

Before, he'd seen them only in loincloths, as Sazed had\nreported. Yet, many of these koloss had pants, shirts, or skirts pulled onto\ntheir bodies. They wore the clothing without regard for size, and most\npieces were so tight they had torn. Others were so loose they had to be tied\non. Elend saw a few of the larger koloss wearing garments like bandanas\ntied around their arms or heads.\n\"We are not koloss,\" the lead koloss suddenly said, turning to Elend as\nthey walked.\nElend frowned. \"Explain.\"\n\"You think we are koloss,\" it said through lips that were stretched too\ntightly to work properly. \"We are humans. We will live in your city. We will\nkill you, and we will take it.\"\nElend shivered, realizing the source of the mismatched garments. They\nhad come from the village that the koloss had attacked, the one whose\nrefugees had trickled into Luthadel. This appeared to be a new development\nin koloss thinking. Or, had it always been there, repressed by the Lord\nRuler? The scholar in Elend was fascinated. The rest of him was simply\nhorrified.\nHis koloss guide paused before a small group of tents, the only such\nstructures in the camp. Then the lead koloss turned and yelled, startling\nElend's horse. Elend fought to keep his mount from throwing him as the\nkoloss jumped and attacked one of its companions, proceeding to pummel it\nwith a massive fist.\nElend won his struggle. The lead koloss, however, did not.\nElend climbed off his horse, patting the beast on the neck as the\nvictimized koloss pulled his sword from the chest of his former leader. The\nsurvivor—who now bore several cuts in his skin that hadn't come from\nstretching—bent down to harvest the pouches tied to the corpse's back.\nElend watched with a muted fascination as the koloss stood and spoke.\n\"He was never a good leader,\" it said in a slurred voice.\nI can't let these monsters attack my city, Elend thought. I have to do\nsomething. He pulled his horse forward, turning his back on the koloss as he\nentered the secluded section of camp, watched over by a group of nervous\nyoung men in uniforms. Elend handed his reins to one of them.\n\"Take care of this for me,\" Elend said, striding forward.\n\"Wait!\" one of the soldiers said. \"Halt!\"\nElend turned sharply, facing the shorter man, who was trying to both\nlevel his spear at Elend and keep an eye on the koloss. Elend didn't try to be\nharsh; he just wanted to keep his own anxiety under control and keep\nmoving. Either way, the resulting glare probably would have impressed\neven Tindwyl.\nThe soldier jerked to a halt.\n\"I am Elend Venture,\" Elend said. \"You know that name?\"\nThe man nodded.\n\"You may announce me to Lord Lekal,\" Elend said. \"Just get to the\ntent before I do.\""

Elend followed, striding up to the\ntent, where other soldiers stood hesitantly.\nWhat must it have done to them, Elend wondered, living surrounded by\nkoloss, so terribly outnumbered? Feeling a stab of pity, he didn't try to bully\nhis way in. He stood with faux patience until a voice called from inside.\n\"Let him in.\"\nElend brushed past the guards and threw open the tent flap.\nThe months had not been kind to Jastes Lekal. Somehow, the few\nwisps of hair on his head looked far more pathetic than complete baldness\nwould have. His suit was sloppy and stained, his eyes underlined by a pair\nof deep bags. He was pacing, and jumped slightly when Elend entered.\nThen he froze for a moment, eyes wide. Finally, he raised a quivering\nhand to push back hair he didn't have. \"Elend?\" he asked. \"What in the Lord\nRuler's name happened to you?\"\n\"Responsibility, Jastes,\" Elend said quietly. \"It appears that neither of\nus were ready for it.\"\n\"Out,\" Jastes said, waving to his guards. They shuffled past Elend,\nclosing the tent flap behind them.\n\"It's been a while, Elend,\" Jastes said, chuckling weakly.\nElend nodded.\n\"I remember those days,\" Jastes said, \"sitting in your den or mine,\nsharing a drink with Telden. We were so innocent, weren't we?\"\n\"Innocent,\" Elend said, \"but hopeful.\"\n\"Want something to drink?\" Jastes said, turning toward the room's\ndesk. Elend eyed the bottles and flasks lying in the corner of the room. They\nwere all empty. Jastes removed a full bottle from the desk and poured Elend\na small cup, the size and clear color an indication that this was no simple\ndinner wine.\nElend accepted the small cup, but did not drink. \"What happened,\nJastes? How did the clever, thoughtful philosopher I knew turn into a\ntyrant?\"\n\"Tyrant?\" Jastes snapped, downing his cup in a single shot. \"I'm no\ntyrant. Your father's the tyrant. I'm just a realist.\"\n\"Sitting at the center of a koloss army doesn't seem to be a very\nrealistic position to me.\"\n\"I can control them.\"\n\"And Suisna?\" Elend asked. \"The village they slaughtered?\"\nJastes wavered. \"That was an unfortunate accident.\"\nElend looked down at the drink in his hand, then threw it aside, the\nliquor splashing on the dusty tent floor. \"This isn't my father's den, and we\nare not friends any longer. I will call no man friend who leads something\nlike this against my city. What happened to your honor, Jastes Lekal?\"\nJastes snorted, glancing at the spilled liquor. \"That's always been the\nproblem with you, Elend. So certain, so optimistic, so self-righteous.\"\n\"It was our optimism,\" Elend said, stepping forward. \"We wanted to"

Did you even pay\nattention to what was happening in the Southern Dominance while you\nplayed in Luthadel?\"\n\"I'm sorry about what happened to your family, Jastes.\"\n\"Sorry?\" Jastes said, snatching the bottle off his desk. \"You're sorry? I\nimplemented your plans, Elend. I did everything we talked about—\nfreedom, political honesty. I trusted my allies rather than crushing them into\nsubmission. And you know what happened?\"\nElend closed his eyes.\n\"They killed everyone, Elend,\" Jastes said. \"That's what you do when\nyou take over. You kill your rivals and their families—even the young girls,\neven the babies. And you leave their bodies, as a warning. That's good\npolitics. That's how you stay in power!\"\n\"It's easy to believe in something when you win all the time, Jastes,\"\nElend said, opening his eyes. \"The losses are what define a man's faith.\"\n\"Losses?\" Jastes demanded. \"My sister was a loss?\"\n\"No, I mean—\"\n\"Enough!\" Jastes snapped, slamming the bottle down on his desk.\n\"Guards!\"\nTwo men threw back the tent flap and moved into the room.\n\"Take His Majesty captive,\" Jastes said, with an unsteady wave of his\nhand. \"Send a messenger to the city, tell them that we want to negotiate.\"\n\"I'm not king anymore, Jastes,\" Elend said.\nJastes stopped.\n\"Do you think I'd come here and let myself get captured if I were\nking?\" Elend asked. \"They deposed me. The Assembly invoked a no-\nconfidence clause and chose a new king.\"\n\"You bloody idiot,\" Jastes said.\n\"Losses, Jastes,\" Elend said. \"It hasn't been as hard for me as it was for\nyou, but I do think I understand.\"\n\"So,\" Jastes said, running a hand through his \"hair,\" \"that fancy suit\nand haircut didn't save you, eh?\"\n\"Take your koloss and go, Jastes.\"\n\"That sounded like a threat, Elend,\" Jastes said. \"You aren't king, you\ndon't have an army, and I don't see your Mistborn around.

They decided that's the way that 'humans' did it,\nso they should do it, too?

One laid a hand on Elend's shoulder.\nElend's reaction surprised even himself. He slammed his elbow up into\nthe man's face, shattering his nose, then took the other man down with a\nkick to the leg. Before Jastes could do more than cry out, Elend jumped\nforward.\nElend ripped an obsidian knife—given to him by Vin—from his boot\nand caught Jastes by the shoulder. Elend slammed the whimpering man\naround, pushing him backward onto the desk and—barely thinking to\nconsider his actions—rammed the knife into his old friend's shoulder.\nJastes emitted a loud, pathetic scream.\n\"If killing you would do anything useful, Jastes,\" Elend growled, \"I'd\ndo it right now. But I don't know how you control these things, and I don't\nwant to set them loose.\"\nSoldiers piled into the room. Elend didn't look up. He slapped Jastes,\nstopping his cries of pain.\n\"You listen,\" Elend said. \"I don't care if you've been hurt, I don't care if\nyou don't believe in the philosophies anymore, and I don't really care if you\nget yourself killed playing politics with Straff and Cett.\n\"But I do care if you threaten my people. I want you to march your\narmy out of my dominance—go attack Straff's homeland, or maybe Cett's.\nThey're both undefended. I promise I won't let your enemies get the atium.\n\"And, as a friend, I'll give you a bit of counsel. Think about that\nwound in your arm for a little while, Jastes. I was your best friend, and I\nnearly killed you. What the hell are you doing sitting in the middle of an\nentire army of deranged koloss?\"\nSoldiers surrounded him. Elend stood, ripping the knife from Jastes's\nbody and spinning the man around, pressing the weapon against his throat.\nThe guards froze.\n\"I'm leaving,\" Elend said, pushing the confused Jastes ahead of him,\nmoving out of the tent. He noticed with some concern that there were barely\na dozen human guards. Sazed had counted more. Where had Jastes lost\nthem?\nThere was no sign of Elend's horse. So he kept a wary eye on the\nsoldiers, pulling Jastes toward the invisible line between the human camp\nand the koloss one. Elend turned as he reached the perimeter, then pushed\nJastes back toward his men. They caught him, one pulling out a bandage for\nthe arm. Others made moves as if to chase Elend, but they paused, hesitant.\nElend had crossed the line into the koloss camp.

The man Elend had known was dead, replaced by this\nproduct of a new world that didn't kindly regard philosophers and idealists.\nElend turned away, walking among the koloss. A group of them\nquickly approached. The same one as before? He couldn't tell for certain.\n\"Take me out,\" Elend commanded, meeting the eyes of the largest\nkoloss in the team. Either Elend seemed more commanding now, or this\nkoloss was more easily cowed, for there was no argument. The creature\nsimply nodded and began to shuffle out of the camp, his team surrounding\nElend.\nThis trip was a waste, Elend thought with frustration. All I did was\nantagonize Jastes. I risked my life for nothing.\nIf only I could find out what was in those pouches!\nHe eyed the group of koloss around him. It was a typical group,\nranging in size from five feet to one ten-foot monstrosity. They walked\nalong with slumped, unengaged postures. . ..\nElend still had his knife out.\nThis is stupid, he thought. For some reason, that didn't stop him from\nchoosing the smallest koloss in the group, taking a deep breath, and\nattacking.\nThe rest of the koloss paused to watch. The creature Elend had chosen\nspun—but in the wrong direction. It turned to face its companion koloss,\nthe one nearest to it in size, as Elend tackled it, ramming the knife into its\nback.\nEven at five feet with a small build, the koloss was incredibly strong. It\ntossed Elend off, bellowing in pain. Elend, however, managed to keep hold\nof his dagger.\nCan't let it get out that sword, he thought, scrambling to his feet and\nramming his knife into the creature's thigh. The koloss dropped again,\npunching at Elend with one arm, fingers reaching for its sword with the\nother. Elend took the punch to the chest, and fell back to the sooty ground.\nHe groaned, gasping. The koloss pulled out its sword, but had trouble\nstanding. Both knife wounds bled stark red blood; the liquid seemed\nbrighter, more reflective, than that of a human, but that might have just been\na contrast with the deep blue skin.\nThe koloss finally managed to gain its feet, and Elend realized his\nmistake. He'd let the adrenaline of his confrontation with Jastes—his\nfrustration at his inability to stop the armies—drive him. He'd sparred a lot\nlately, but he was in no position to take a koloss.\nBut it was far too late to worry about that now.\nElend rolled out of the way as a thick, clublike sword smashed to the\nground beside him. Instincts overrode terror, and he mostly managed to\navoid the backswing. It took him a bit in the side, spraying a patch of blood\nacross his once white uniform, but he barely even felt the cut.\nOnly one way to win a knife fight against a guy with a sword. . .Elend"

The thought, oddly, hadn't come from one of his\ntrainers, or even from Vin. He wasn't sure where it came from, but he\ntrusted it.\nClose in tight as fast as possible, and kill quickly.\nAnd Elend attacked. The koloss swung as well. Elend could see the\nattack, but couldn't do anything about it. He could only throw himself\nforward, knife raised, teeth clenched.\nHe rammed his knife into the koloss's eye, barely managing to get\ninside the creature's reach. Even so, the hilt of the sword hit him in the\nstomach.\nBoth dropped.\nElend groaned quietly, slowly becoming aware of the hard, ash-packed\nearth and weeds eaten down to their roots. A fallen twig was scratching his\ncheek. Odd that he would notice that, considering the pain in his chest. He\nstumbled to his feet. The koloss he'd attacked did not rise. Its companions\nstood, looking unconcerned, though their eyes were focused on him. They\nseemed to want something.\n\"He ate my horse,\" Elend said, saying the first thing that came to his\nclouded mind.\nThe group of koloss nodded. Elend stumbled forward, wiping the ash\nfrom his cheek with a dazed hand as he knelt beside the dead creature. He\nripped his knife out, then slid it back in his boot. Next he unfastened the\npouches; this koloss had two.\nFinally, not certain why, he grabbed the creature's large sword and\nrested it up on his shoulder. It was so weighty that he could barely carry it,\nand certainly wouldn't be able to swing it. How does a creature so small use\nsomething like this?\nThe koloss watched him work without comment; then they led him out\nof the camp. Once they had retreated, Elend pulled open one of the pouches\nand looked inside.\nHe shouldn't have been surprised by what he found inside. Jastes had\ndecided to control his army the old-fashioned way.\nHe was paying them.\nThe others call me mad. As I have said, that may be true.\n43\nMIST POURED INTO THE DARK room, collapsing around Vin like\na waterfall as she stood in the open balcony doorway. Elend was a\nmotionless lump sleeping in his bed a short distance away.\nApparently, Mistress, OreSeur had explained, he went into the koloss\ncamp alone. You were asleep, and none of us knew what he was doing. I\ndon't think he managed to persuade the creatures not to attack, but he did\ncome back with some very useful information.\nOreSeur sat on his haunches beside her. He had not asked why Vin had\ncome to Elend's rooms, nor why she stood, quietly watching the former\nking in the night.\nShe couldn't protect him. She tried so hard, but the impossibility of\nkeeping even one person safe suddenly seemed so real—so tangible—to her\nthat she felt sick.\nElend had been right to go out.

They flew over Wellen with a rustle of black cloth.\nAnd they left him behind, alone amid the corpses of what had once\nbeen a squad of forty men.\nVin landed in a crouch, bare feet on the cool stone cobbles of the\nHasting courtyard. Zane landed upright, standing—as always—with his\ntowering air of self-confidence.\nPewter blazed within her, giving her muscles the taut energy of a\nthousand excited moments. She easily ignored the pain of her wounded\nside. Her sole bead of atium rested in her stomach, but she didn't use it. Not\nyet. Not unless she was right, and Cett proved to be Mistborn.\n\"We'll go from the bottom up,\" Zane said.\nVin nodded. The central tower of Keep Hasting was many stories high,"

        "text": "yet. Not unless she was right, and Cett proved to be Mistborn.\n\"We'll go from the bottom up,\" Zane said.\nVin nodded. The central tower of Keep Hasting was many stories high,\nand they couldn't know which one Cett was on. If they started low, he\nwouldn't be able to escape.\nBesides. Going up would be more difficult. The energy in Vin's limbs\ncried for release. She'd waited, remained coiled, for far too long. She was\ntired of weakness, tired of being restrained. She had spent months as a\nknife, held immobile at someone's throat.\nIt was time to cut.\nThe two dashed forward. Torches began to light around them as Cett's\nmen—those who camped in the courtyard—awakened to the alarm. Tents\nunfurled and collapsed, men yelling in surprise, looking for the army that\nassailed them. They could only wish that they were so lucky.\nVin jumped straight up into the air, and Zane spun, throwing a bag of\ncoins around him. Hundreds of bits of copper sparkled in the air beneath her\n—a peasant's fortune. Vin landed with a rustle, and they both Pushed, their\npower throwing the coins outward. The torch-sparkled missiles ripped\nthrough the camp, dropping surprised, drowsy men.\nVin and Zane continued toward the central tower. A squad of soldiers\nhad formed up at the tower's front. They still seemed disoriented, confused,\nand sleepy, but they were armed. Armed with metal armor and steel\nweapons—a choice that, had they actually been facing an enemy army,\nwould have been wise.\nZane and Vin slid into the midst of the soldiers. Zane tossed a single\ncoin into the air between them. Vin reached out and Pushed against it,\nfeeling Zane's weight as he also Pushed against it.\nBraced against each other, they both Pushed in opposite directions,\nthrowing their weight against the breastplates of the soldiers to either side.\nWith flared pewter—holding each other steady—their Pushes scattered the\nsoldiers as if they had been slapped by enormous hands. Spears and swords\ntwisted in the night, clattering to the cobbles. Breastplates towed bodies\naway.\nVin extinguished her steel as she felt Zane's weight come off the coin.\nThe sparkling bit of metal bounced to the ground between them, and Zane\nturned, throwing up his hand toward the single soldier who remained\nstanding directly between Zane and the keep doors.\nA squad of soldiers raced up behind Zane, but they suddenly halted as\nhe Pushed against them—then sent the transfer of weight directly into the\nlone soldier. The unfortunate man crashed backward into the keep doors.\nBones crunched. The doors flung open as the soldier burst into the\nroom beyond. Zane ducked through the open doorway, and Vin moved\nsmoothly behind him, her bare feet leaving rough cobbles and falling on\nsmooth marble instead.\nSoldiers waited inside. These didn't wear armor, and they carried large\nwooden shields to block coins. They were armed with staves or obsidian\nswords. Hazekillers—men trained specifically to fight Allomancers. There\nwere, perhaps, fifty of them.\nNow it begins in earnest, Vin thought, leaping into the air and Pushing\noff the door's hinges."

As the soldier\ncrashed into them, Vin landed amid a second group. She spun on the floor,\nwhipping out her legs and flaring pewter, tripping a good four men. As the\nothers tried to strike, she Pushed downward against a coin in her pouch,\nripping it free and throwing herself upward. She spun in the air, catching a\nfalling staff discarded by a tripped soldier.\nObsidian cracked against the white marble where she had been. Vin\ncame down with her own weapon and struck, attacking faster than anyone\nshould be able to, hitting ears, chins, and throats. Skulls cracked. Bones\nbroke. She was barely breathing hard when she found all ten of her\nopponents down.\nTen men. . .didn't Kelsier once tell me he had trouble with half a dozen\nhazekillers?\nNo time to think. A large group of soldiers charged her. She yelled and\njumped toward them, throwing her staff into the face of the first man she\nmet. The others raised their shields, surprised, but Vin whipped out a pair of\nobsidian daggers as she landed. She rammed them into the thighs of two\nmen before her, then spun past them, attacking flesh where she saw it.\nAn attack flickered from the corner of her eye, and she snapped up an\narm, blocking the wooden staff as it came for her head. The wood cracked,\nand she took the man down with a wide sweep of the dagger, nearly\nbeheading him. She jumped backward as the others moved in, braced\nherself, then yanked on the armored corpse Zane had used before, Pulling it\ntoward her.\nShields did little good against a missile so large. Vin smashed the\ncorpse into her opponents, sweeping them before her. To the side, she could\nsee the remnants of the hazekillers who had attacked Zane. Zane stood\namong them, a black pillar before the fallen, arms outstretched. He met her\neyes, then nodded toward the rear of the chamber.\nVin ignored the few remaining hazekillers. She Pushed against the\ncorpse and sent herself sliding across the floor. Zane jumped up, Pushing\nback, shattering his way through a window and into the mists. Vin quickly\ndid a check of the back rooms: no Cett. She turned and took down a\nstraggling hazekiller as she ducked into the lift shaft.\nShe needed no elevator. She shot straight up on a Pushed coin, bursting\nout onto the third floor. Zane would take the second.\nVin landed quietly on the marble floor, hearing footsteps come down a\nstairwell beside her. She recognized this large, open room: it was the\nchamber where she and Elend had met Cett for dinner. It was now empty,\neven the table removed, but she recognized the circular perimeter of\nstained-glass windows.\nHazekillers burst from the kitchen room. Dozens.

She glanced at the open kitchen doors, and saw no Cett\nbeyond. This floor was clear.\nCett certainly brought a lot of hazekillers, she thought, backing quietly\nto the center of the room. Save for the stairwell, kitchens, and pillars, the\nroom was mostly surrounded in arched stained-glass windows.\nHe planned for my attack. Or, he tried to.\nVin ducked down as the waves of men surrounded her. She turned her\nhead up, eyes closed, and burned duralumin.\nThen she Pulled.\nStained-glass windows—set in metal frames inside their arches—\nexploded around the room. She felt the metal frames burst inward, twisting\non themselves before her awesome power. She imagined twinkling slivers\nof multicolored glass in the air. She heard men scream as glass and metal hit\nthem, embedding in their flesh.\nOnly the outer layer of men would die from the blast. Vin opened her\neyes and jumped as a dozen dueling canes fell around her. She passed\nthrough a hail of attacks. Some hit. It didn't matter. She couldn't feel pain at\nthe moment.\nShe Pushed against a broken metal frame, throwing herself over the\nheads of soldiers, landing outside the large circle of attackers. The outer line\nof men was down, impaled by glass shards and twisted metal frames. Vin\nraised a hand and bowed her head.\nDuralumin and steel. She Pushed. The world lurched.\nVin shot out into the mists through a broken window as she Pushed\nagainst the line of corpses impaled by metal frames. The bodies were\nthrown away from her, smashing into the men who were still alive in the\ncenter.\nDead, dying, and unharmed were swept from the room, Pushed out the\nwindow opposite Vin. Bodies twisted in the mists, fifty men thrown into the\nnight, leaving the room empty save for trails of blood and discarded bits of\nglass.\nVin downed a vial of metals as the mists rushed around her; then she\nPulled herself back toward the keep, using a window on the fourth floor. As\nshe approached, a corpse crashed through the window, falling out into the\nnight. She caught a glimpse of Zane disappearing out another window on\nthe opposite side. This level was clear.\nLights burned on the fifth floor. They probably could have come here\nfirst, but that wasn't the plan. Zane was right. They didn't just need to kill\nCett. They needed to terrify his entire army.\nVin Pushed against the same corpse that Zane had thrown out the\nwindow, using its metal armor as an anchor. It shot down at an angle,\npassing just inside a broken window, and Vin soared upward in an angle\naway from the building.

The soldiers that waited beyond\njumped backward, spinning. One wore a metal belt buckle. He died first.\nThe other twenty barely knew how to react as the buckle buzzed through\ntheir ranks, twisting between Vin's Pushes and Pulls. They had been trained,\ninstructed, and perhaps even tested against Allomancers.\nBut they had never fought Vin.\nMen screamed and fell, Vin ripping through their ranks with only the\nbuckle as a weapon. Before the force of her pewter, tin, steel, and iron, the\npossible use of atium seemed an incredible waste. Even without it, she was\na terrible weapon—one that, until this moment, even she hadn't understood.\nMistborn.\nThe last man fell. Vin stood among them, feeling a numbing sense of\nsatisfaction. She let the belt buckle slip from her fingers. It hit carpet. She\nstood in a room that wasn't unadorned as the rest of the building had been;\nthere was furniture here, and there were some minor decorations. Perhaps\nElend's clearing crews hadn't gotten this far before Cett's arrival, or perhaps\nhe'd simply brought some of his own comforts.\nBehind her was the stairwell. In front of her was a fine wooden wall set\nwith a door—the inner apartments. Vin stepped forward quietly, mistcloak\nrustling as she Pulled four lamps off the brackets behind her. They whipped\nforward, and she sidestepped, letting them crash into the wall. Fire\nblossomed across splattered oil, billowing across the wall, the force of the\nlamps breaking the door on its hinges. She raised a hand, Pushing it fully\nopen.\nFire dripped around her as she stepped into the room beyond. The\nrichly decorated chamber was quiet, and eerily empty save for two figures.\nCett sat in a simple wooden chair, bearded, sloppily dressed, and looking\nvery, very tired. Cett's young son stepped in between Cett and Vin. The boy\nheld a dueling cane.\nSo, which one is Mistborn?\nThe boy swung. Vin caught the weapon, then shoved the boy to the\nside. He crashed into the wooden wall, then slumped to the ground. Vin\neyed him.\n\"Leave Gneorndin alone, woman,\" Cett said. \"Do what you came to\ndo.\"\nVin turned toward the nobleman. She remembered her frustration, her\nrage, her cool, icy anger. She stepped forward and grabbed Cett by the front\nof his suit. \"Fight me,\" she said, and tossed him backward.\nHe slammed against the back wall, then slumped to the ground. Vin\nprepared her atium, but he did not rise. He simply rolled to the side,\ncoughing.\nVin walked over, pulling him up by one arm. He balled a fist, trying to\nstrike her, but he was pathetically weak. She let the blows bounce off her\nside."

Yet, he held his ground.\nPathetically, hopelessly, he stood before the body of the fallen Cett.\n\"Step aside, son,\" Cett said in a tired voice. \"There is nothing you can\ndo here.\"\nThe boy started to shake, then began to weep.\nTears, Vin thought, feeling an oddly surreal feeling cloud her mind.\nShe reached up, surprised to find wet streaks on her own cheeks.\n\"You have no Mistborn,\" she whispered.\nCett had struggled to a half-reclining position, and he looked into her\neyes.\n\"No Allomancers faced us this night,\" she said. \"You used them all on\nthe assassination attempt in the Assembly Hall?\"\n\"The only Allomancers I had, I sent against you months ago,\" Cett said\nwith a sigh. \"They were all I ever had, my only hope of killing you. Even\nthey weren't from my family. My whole line has been corrupted by skaa\nblood—Allrianne is the only Allomancer to be born to us for centuries.\"\n\"You came to Luthadel. . .\"\n\"Because Straff would have come for me eventually,\" Cett said. \"My\nbest chance, lass, was to kill you early on.

Besides, I've always\nbeen a gambling man.\" He looked up at her, meeting her eyes. \"Do what\nyou came to,\" he repeated.\nVin shivered. She couldn't feel her tears. She could barely feel\nanything.\nWhy? Why can't I make sense of anything anymore?\nThe room began to shake. Vin spun, looking toward the back wall. The\nwood there quivered and spasmed like a dying animal. Nails began to pop,\nripping backward through the paneling; then the entire wall burst away\nfrom Vin.

Most\npeople wouldn't have been able to read beyond the sneer on the squat\ngeneral's face. But Breeze saw more: he saw the tension in the taut skin\naround Clubs's eyes, he noticed the way that Clubs tapped his finger against\nthe frosty stone wall. Clubs was not a nervous man. The motions meant\nsomething.\n\"This is it, then?\" Breeze asked quietly.\nClubs nodded.\nBreeze couldn't see it. There were still two armies out there; it was still\na standoff. Yet, he trusted Clubs's assessment. Or, rather, he trusted his own\nknowledge of people enough to trust his assessment of Clubs.\nThe general knew something he didn't.\n\"Kindly explain,\" Breeze said.\n\"This'll end when Straff figures it out,\" Clubs said.\n\"Figures what out?\"\n\"That those koloss will do his job for him, if he lets them.\"\nBreeze paused.

They stood in Elend's\nstudy, the only other occupant being Spook, who sat lounging beside the\ntable.\n\"El,\" Ham said, \"Cett only had a thousand men with him here in\nLuthadel.

What if Cett had\nkilled her?

She had left the keep with one of\nthe top floors in flames—and, for some reason, she had left Cett alive.\nSince then, nobody had seen her.\nElend closed his eyes, pausing as he leaned a hand against the stone\nwall.

It's almost like I don't know her\nanymore.\nOr did I ever know her in the first place?\nIt felt wrong to not have her with him. He had come to rely on her\nsimple bluntness. He needed her genuine realism—her sheer sense of\nconcreteness—to keep him grounded. He needed to hold her, so that he\ncould know that there was something more important than theories and\nconcepts.\nHe loved her.\n\"I don't know, El,\" Ham finally said. \"I never thought that Vin would\nbe a liability, but she had a hard youth.

I. . .don't\nknow that she's completely stable.\"\nElend opened his eyes. \"She's stable, Ham,\" he said firmly. \"And she's\nmore capable than any of us.\"\nHam frowned. \"But—\"\n\"She had a good reason for attacking Cett,\" Elend said. \"I trust her.\"\nHam and Spook exchanged glances, and Spook just shrugged.\n\"It's more than last night, El,\" Ham said. \"Something's not right with\nthat girl—not just mentally, either. . ..\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Elend asked.\n\"Remember the attack on the Assembly?\" Ham said. \"You told me you\nsaw her get hit square-on by a Thug's staff.\"\n\"And?\" Elend asked. \"It laid her out for three full days.\"\nHam shook his head. \"Her complete collection of wounds—getting hit\nin the side, the shoulder wound, nearly being choked to death—those all\ntogether laid her out for a couple of days. But, if she'd really gotten hit that\nhard by a Thug, she shouldn't have been out for days, Elend. She should\nhave been out for weeks. Maybe longer. She certainly shouldn't have\nescaped without broken ribs.\"\n\"She was burning pewter,\" Elend said.\n\"Presumably, so was the Thug.\"\nElend paused.\n\"You see?\" Ham said. \"If both were flaring pewter, then they should\nhave balanced each other out.

It was a poor representation of a boxing; it was\nlittle wonder that the fakes had been so easy to pick out. Only a fool would\ntry to pass them off as real. A fool, or a koloss.\nNobody was certain how some of Jastes's fake boxings had worked\ntheir way up to Luthadel; perhaps he had tried giving them to peasants or\nbeggars in his home dominance.

If Cett does have a Mistborn, and he decides to\nretaliate. . .\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said again, bidding the two farewell.\nHam waved to Spook, and the two of them left, off to check with\nBreeze and Clubs.\nThey all act so glum, Elend thought, leaving his rooms to find\nsomething to eat. It's like they think we're doomed because of one setback.\nBut, Cett's withdrawal is a good thing. One of our enemies is leaving—and\nthere are still two armies out there. Jastes won't attack if doing so exposes\nhim to Straff, and Straff himself is too scared of Vin to do anything. In fact,\nher attack on Cett will only make my father more frightened. Maybe that's\nwhy she did it.\n\"Your Majesty?\" a voice whispered.\nElend spun, searching the hallway.\n\"Your Majesty,\" said a short figure in the shadows. OreSeur. \"I think\nI've found her.\"\nElend didn't bring anyone with him save for a few guards. He didn't\nwant to explain to Ham and the others how he'd gotten his information; Vin\nstill insisted on keeping OreSeur secret.\nHam's right about one thing, Elend thought as his carriage pulled to a\nstop. She is hiding things. She does it all the time.\nBut that didn't stop him from trusting her. He nodded to OreSeur, and\nthey left the carriage. Elend waved his guards back as he approached a\ndilapidated building. It had probably once been a poor merchant's shop—a\nplace run by extremely low nobility, selling meager necessities to skaa\nworkers in exchange for food tokens, which could in turn be exchanged for\nmoney from the Lord Ruler.\nThe building was in a sector that Elend's fuel-collection crews hadn't\nreached yet. It was obvious, however, that it hadn't seen a lot of use lately. It\nhad been ransacked long ago, and the ash coating the floor was a good four\ninches deep. A small trail of footprints led toward a back stairwell.\n\"What is this place?\" Elend asked with a frown.\nOreSeur shrugged a pair of dog's shoulders.\n\"Then how did you know she was here?\"\n\"I followed her last night, Your Majesty,\" OreSeur said. \"I saw the\ngeneral direction she went. After that, it was simply a process of careful\nsearching.\"\nElend frowned. \"That still must have taken some pretty mean tracking\nabilities, kandra.\"\n\"These bones have unusually keen senses.\"\nElend nodded. The stairwell led up into a long hallway with several\nrooms at the ends. Elend began to walk down the hallway, then paused. To\none side, a panel on the wall had been slid back, revealing a small cubby.\nHe could hear movement within.\n\"Vin?\" he asked, poking his head into the cubby.\nThere was a small room hidden behind the wall, and Vin sat on the far\nside. The room—more of a nook—was only a few feet across, and even Vin\nwouldn't have been able to stand up in it. She didn't respond to him. She\nsimply sat, leaning against the far wall, head turned away from him."

She\nsimply sat, leaning against the far wall, head turned away from him.\nElend crawled inside the small chamber, getting ash on his knees. It\nwas barely large enough for him to enter without bumping into her. \"Vin?\nAre you all right?\"\nShe sat, twisting something between her fingers. And she was looking\nat the wall—looking through a narrow hole. Elend could see sunlight\nshining through.\nIt's a peephole, he realized. To watch the street below. This isn't a shop\n—it's a thieving hideout. Or, it was.\n\"I used to think Camon was a terrible man,\" Vin said quietly.\nElend paused, on hands and knees. Finally, he settled back into a\ncramped seated position. At least Vin didn't look hurt. \"Camon?\" he asked.\n\"Your old crewleader, before Kelsier?\"\nVin nodded. She turned away from the slit, sitting with her arms\naround her knees. \"He beat people, he killed those who disagreed with him.\nEven among street thugs, he was brutal.\"\nElend frowned.\n\"But,\" Vin said quietly, \"I doubt he killed as many people during his\nentire life as I killed last night.\"\nElend closed his eyes. Then he opened them and shuffled a little closer,\nlaying a hand on Vin's shoulder. \"Those were enemy soldiers, Vin.\"\n\"I was like a child in a room full of bugs,\" Vin whispered. He could\nfinally see what was in her fingers. It was her earring, the simple bronze\nstud that she always wore. She looked down at it, twisting it between her\nfingers.\n\"Did I ever tell you how I got this?\" she asked. He shook his head.\n\"My mother gave it to me,\" she said. \"I don't remember it happening—Reen\ntold me about it. My mother. . .she heard voices sometimes. She killed my\nbaby sister, slaughtered her. And that same day she gave me this, one of her\nown earrings. As if. . .as if choosing me over my sister. A punishment for\none, a twisted present for another.\"\nVin shook her head. \"My entire life has been death, Elend. Death of\nmy sister, the death of Reen. Crewmembers dead around me, Kelsier falling\nto the Lord Ruler, then my own spear in the Lord Ruler's chest. I try to\nprotect, and tell myself that I'm escaping it all. And then. . .I do something\nlike I did last night.\"\nNot certain what else to do, Elend pulled her close. She was stiff,\nhowever. \"You had a good reason for what you did,\" he said.\n\"No I didn't,\" Vin said. \"I just wanted to hurt them. I wanted to scare\nthem and make them leave you alone. It sounds childish, but that's how I\nfelt.\"\n\"It's not childish, Vin,\" Elend said. \"It was good strategy. You gave our\nenemies a show of force. You frightened away one of our major opponents,\nand now my father will be even more afraid to attack.

I don't want to be like him, Elend. But,\neverything seems to be pushing me in that direction.\"\n\"I. . .\" You're not like him, he wanted to say. It was true, but the words\nwouldn't come out. They rang hollow to him.\nInstead, he pulled Vin close, her shoulder up against his chest, head\nbeneath his chin. \"I wish I knew the right things to say, Vin,\" he whispered.\n\"Seeing you like this makes every protective instinct inside of me twist. I\nwant to make it better—I want to fix everything—but I don't know how.\nTell me what to do. Just tell me how I can help!\"\nShe resisted his embrace a little at first, but then sighed quietly and slid\nher arms around him, holding him tightly. \"You can't help with this,\" she\nsaid softly. \"I have to do it alone. There are. . .decisions I have to make.\"\nHe nodded. \"You'll make the right ones, Vin.\"\n\"You don't even know what I'm deciding.\"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"I know I can't help—I couldn't even hold\non to my own throne. You're ten times as capable as I am.\"\nShe squeezed his arm. \"Don't say things like that. Please?\"\nHe frowned at the tension in her voice, then nodded. \"All right. But,\neither way, I trust you, Vin. Make your decisions—I'll support you.\"\nShe nodded, relaxing a bit beneath his arms. \"I think. . .\" she said. \"I\nthink I have to leave Luthadel.\"\n\"Leave? And go where?\"\n\"North,\" she said. \"To Terris.\"\nElend sat back, resting against the wooden wall. Leave? he thought\nwith a twisting feeling. Is this what I've earned by being so distracted\nlately?\nHave I lost her?\nAnd yet, he'd just told her that he'd support her decisions. \"If you feel\nyou have to go, Vin,\" he found himself saying, \"then you should do so.\"\n\"If I were to leave, would you go with me?\"\n\"Now?\"\nVin nodded, head rubbing his chest.\n\"No,\" he finally said. \"I couldn't leave Luthadel, not with those armies\nstill out there.\"\n\"But the city rejected you.\"\n\"I know,\" he said, sighing. \"But. . .I can't leave them, Vin. They\nrejected me, but I won't abandon them.\"\nVin nodded again, and something told him this was the answer she had\nexpected.\nElend smiled. \"We're a mess, aren't we?\"\n\"Hopeless,\" she said softly, sighing as she finally pulled away from"

Outside the room, Elend could hear footsteps.\nOreSeur appeared a moment later, poking his head into the hidden chamber.\n\"Your guards are growing restless, Your Majesty,\" he said to Elend.\n\"They will soon come looking for you.\"\nElend nodded, shuffling over to the exit. Once in the hallway, he\noffered a hand to help Vin out. She took the hand, crawling out, then stood\nand dusted off her clothing—her typical shirt and trousers.\nWill she ever go back to dresses now? he wondered.\n\"Elend,\" she said, fishing in a pocket. \"Here, you can spend this, if you\nwant.\"\nShe opened up her hand, dropping a bead into his hand.\n\"Atium?\" he asked incredulously. \"Where did you get it?\"\n\"From a friend,\" she said.\n\"And you didn't burn it last night?\" Elend asked. \"When you were\nfighting all those soldiers?\"\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"I swallowed it, but I didn't end up needing it, so I\nforced it back up.\"\nLord Ruler! Elend thought. I didn't even consider that she didn't have\natium. What could she have done if she'd burned that bit? He looked up at\nher. \"Some reports say that there's another Mistborn in the city.\"\n\"There is. Zane.\"\nElend dropped the bead back into her hand. \"Then keep this. You\nmight need it to fight him.\"\n\"I doubt that,\" Vin said quietly.\n\"Keep it anyway,\" Elend said. \"This is worth a small fortune—but we'd\nneed a very large fortune to make any difference now.

He\nhad to blink a few times as she wrote, his head clouding for a moment from\nfatigue.\nStay alert! he told himself. There isn't much time left. Not much at all. .\n..\nTindwyl was doing a little better than he, but her wakefulness was\nobviously beginning to run out, for she was starting to droop. He'd taken a\nquick nap during the night, rolled up on her floor, but she had carried on. As\nfar as he could tell, she'd been awake for over a week straight.\nThere was much talk of the Rabzeen, during those days, Tindwyl\nwrote. Some said he would come to fight the Conqueror. Others said he was\nthe Conqueror. Helenntion didn't make his thoughts on the matter known to\nme. The Rabzeen is said to be \"He who is not of his people, yet fulfills all of\ntheir wishes.\" If this is the case, then perhaps the Conqueror is the one. He\nis said to have been of Khlennium.\nShe stopped there. Sazed frowned, reading the words again. Kwaan's\nlast testimony—the rubbing Sazed had taken at the Conventical of Seran—\nhad proven useful in more than one way. It had provided a key.\nIt wasn't until years later that I became convinced that he was the\nHero of Ages, Kwaan had written. Hero of Ages: the one called Rabzeen in\nKhlennium, the Anamnesor. . ..\nThe rubbing was a means of translation—not between languages, but\nbetween synonyms. It made sense that there would be other names for the\nHero of Ages; a figure so important, so surrounded by lore, would have\nmany titles. Yet, so much had been lost from those days. The Rabzeen and\nthe Anamnesor were both mythological figures vaguely familiar to Sazed—\nbut they were only two among hosts. Until the discovery of the rubbing,\nthere had been no way to connect their names to the Hero of Ages.\nNow Tindwyl and he could search their metalminds with open eyes.\nPerhaps, in the past, Sazed had read this very passage from Helenntion's\nbiography; he had at least skimmed many of the older records, searching for\nreligious references. Yet, he would never have been able to realize that the\npassage was referring to the Hero of Ages, a figure from Terris lore that the\nKhlenni people had renamed into their own tongue.\n\"Yes. . .\" he said slowly. \"This is good, Tindwyl. Very good.\" He\nreached over, laying his hand on hers.\n\"Perhaps,\" she said, \"though it tells us nothing new.\"\n\"Ah, but the wording might be important, I think,\" Sazed said.\n\"Religions are often very careful with their writings.\"\n\"Especially prophecies,\" Tindwyl said, frowning just a bit. She was not\nfond of anything that smacked of superstition or soothsaying.\n\"I would have thought,\" Sazed noted, \"that you would no longer have\nthis prejudice, considering our current enterprise.\""

However, there is a\nreason I took to studying history as opposed to theology. I don't approve of\nperpetuating lies.\"\n\"Is that what you think I do when I teach of religions?\" he asked in\namusement.\nTindwyl looked toward him. \"A bit,\" she admitted. \"How can you\nteach the people to look toward the gods of the dead, Sazed? Those\nreligions did their people little good, and their prophecies are now dust.\"\n\"Religions are an expression of hope,\" Sazed said. \"That hope gives\npeople strength.\"\n\"Then you don't believe?\" Tindwyl asked. \"You just give the people\nsomething to trust, something to delude themselves?\"\n\"I would not call it so.\"\n\"Then you think the gods you teach of do exist?\"\n\"I. . .think that they deserved to be remembered.\"\n\"And their prophecies?\" Tindwyl said. \"I see scholarly value in what\nwe do—the bringing to light of facts from the past could give us\ninformation about our current problems. Yet, this soothsaying for the future\nis, at its core, foolishness.\"\n\"I would not say that,\" Sazed said. \"Religions are promises—promises\nthat there is something watching over us, guiding us. Prophecies, therefore,\nare natural extensions of the hopes and desires of the people. Not\nfoolishness at all.\"\n\"So, your interest is purely academic?\" Tindwyl said.\n\"I wouldn't say that.\"\nTindwyl studied him, watching his eyes. She frowned slowly. \"You\nbelieve it, don't you?\" she asked. \"You believe that this girl is the Hero of\nAges.\"\n\"I have not yet decided,\" Sazed said.\n\"How can you even consider such a thing, Sazed?\" Tindwyl asked.\n\"Don't you see? Hope is a good thing—a wonderful thing—but you must\nhave hope in something appropriate. If you perpetuate the dreams of the\npast, then you stifle your own dreams of the future.\"\n\"What if the past dreams are worthy of being remembered?\"\nTindwyl shook her head. \"Look at the odds, Sazed. What are the\nchances we would end up where we are, studying this rubbing, in the very\nsame household as the Hero of Ages?\"\n\"Odds are irrelevant when a foretelling is involved.\"\nTindwyl closed her eyes. \"Sazed. . .I think religion is a good thing, and\nbelief is a good thing, but it is foolishness to look for guidance in a few\nvague phrases. Look at what happened last time someone assumed they had\nfound this Hero. The Lord Ruler, the Final Empire, was the result.\"\n\"Still, I will hope.

The ancient people knew of this danger, and\nhad information about it. That information, naturally, broke down and\nbecame legends, prophecies, and even religions.

We must use the time\nwe have left.\"\n\"We should be all right,\" Tindwyl said, sighing and reaching to tuck a\nbit of hair back into her bun. \"Apparently, your Hero scared off Lord Cett\nlast night. The maid who brought breakfast was speaking of it.\"\n\"I know of the event,\" Sazed said.\n\"Then things are growing better for Luthadel.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps.\"\nShe frowned. \"You seem hesitant.\"\n\"I do not know,\" he said, glancing down. \"I do not feel that Cett's\ndeparture is a good thing, Tindwyl.

That stack\ncontained all the notes, ideas, and connections that they'd made during their\nfurious bout of study. It was a book, of sorts—a guidebook that told of the\nHero of Ages and the Deepness. It was a good document—incredible, even,\nconsidering the time they'd been given. It was not comprehensive. It was,\nhowever, probably the most important thing he'd ever written.\nEven if he wasn't certain why.\n\"Sazed?\" Tindwyl asked, frowning. \"What is this?\" She reached to the\nstack of papers, pulling out a sheet that was slightly askew. As she held it\nup, Sazed was shocked to see that a chunk from the bottom right corner had\nbeen torn off.\n\"Did you do this?\" she asked.\n\"No,\" Sazed said. He accepted the paper. It was one of the\ntranscriptions of the rubbing; the tear had removed the last sentence or so.\nThere was no sign of the missing piece.\nSazed looked up, meeting Tindwyl's confused gaze. She turned,\nshuffling through a stack of papers to the side. She pulled out another copy\nof the transcription and held it up.\nSazed felt a chill. The corner was missing.\n\"I referenced this yesterday,\" Tindwyl said quietly. \"I haven't left the\nroom save for a few minutes since then, and you were always here.\"\n\"Did you leave last night?\" Sazed asked. \"To visit the privy while I\nslept?\"\n\"Perhaps.

Even if they'd been torn lying\nright on top of one another, the duplication wouldn't have been so perfect.\nBoth of them sat, staring. Then they burst into motion, riffling through\ntheir stacks of pages. Sazed had four copies of the transcription. All were\nmissing the same exact chunk.\n\"Sazed. . .\" Tindwyl said, her voice shaking just a bit.

A hole had been torn directly in the middle of the\npage, removing the exact same sentence.\n\"The rubbing!\" Tindwyl said, but Sazed was already moving. He left\nhis chair, rushing to the trunk where he stored his metalminds. He fumbled\nwith the key at his neck, pulling it off and unlocking the trunk. He threw it\nopen, removed the rubbing, then unfolded it delicately on the ground. He\nwithdrew his fingers suddenly, feeling almost as if he'd been bitten, as he\nsaw the tear at the bottom. The same sentence, removed.\n\"How is this possible?\" Tindwyl whispered. \"How could someone\nknow so much of our work—so much of us?\"\n\"And yet,\" Sazed said, \"how could they know so little of our abilities?\nI have the entire transcription stored in my metalmind. I can remember it\nright now.\"\n\"What does the missing sentence say?\"\n\"'Alendi must not reach the Well of Ascension; he must not be allowed\nto take the power for himself.'\"\n\"Why remove this sentence?\" Tindwyl asked.\nSazed stared at the rubbing. This seems impossible. . ..\nA noise sounded at the window. Sazed spun, reaching reflexively into\nhis pewtermind and increasing his strength. His muscles swelled, his robe\ngrowing tight.\nThe shutters swung open. Vin crouched on the sill. She paused as she\nsaw Sazed and Tindwyl—who had also apparently tapped strength, growing\nto have almost masculine bulk.\n\"Did I do something wrong?\" Vin asked.\nSazed smiled, releasing his pewtermind. \"No, child,\" he said. \"You\nsimply startled us.\" He met Tindwyl's eye, and she began to gather up the\nripped pieces of paper. Sazed folded up the rubbing; they would discuss it\nfurther later.\n\"Have you seen anyone spending too much time around my room,\nLady Vin?\" Sazed asked as he replaced the rubbing. \"Any strangers—or\neven any particular guards?\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, climbing into the room. She walked barefoot, as usual,\nand she didn't wear her mistcloak; she rarely did in the daytime. If she had\nfought the night before, she had changed clothing, for there were no stains\nof blood—or even sweat—on this outfit. \"Do you want me to watch for\nanyone suspicious?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, please,\" Sazed said, locking the chest. \"We fear that someone has"

Someone who deserves his\nlove.\"\nSazed rose, robes swishing as he stepped to Vin's chair. He stooped\ndown, placing his head even with hers, laying a hand on her shoulder. \"Oh,\nchild. When will you stop worrying and simply let yourself be loved?\"\nVin shook her head. \"It's not that easy.\"\n\"Few things are. Yet, I tell you this, Lady Vin. Love must be allowed to\nflow both ways—if it is not, then it is not truly love, I think. It is something\nelse. Infatuation, perhaps? Either way, there are some of us who are far too\nquick to make martyrs of ourselves. We stand at the side, watching, thinking\nthat we do the right thing by inaction. We fear pain—our own, or that of\nanother.\"\nHe squeezed her shoulder. \"But. . .is that love? Is it love to assume for\nElend that he has no place with you? Or, is it love to let him make his own\ndecision in the matter?\"\n\"And if I'm wrong for him?\" Vin asked.\n\"You must love him enough to trust his wishes, even if you disagree\nwith them. You must respect him—no matter how wrong you think he may\nbe, no matter how poor you think his decisions, you must respect his desire\nto make them. Even if one of them includes loving you.\"\nVin smiled slightly, but she still seemed troubled. \"And. . .\" she said\nvery slowly, \"if there is someone else? For me?\"\nAh. . ..\nShe tensed immediately. \"You mustn't tell Elend I said that.\"\n\"I won't,\" Sazed promised. \"Who is this other man?\"\nVin shrugged. \"Just. . .someone more like myself. The kind of man I\nshould be with.\"\n\"Do you love him?\"\n\"He's strong,\" Vin said. \"He makes me think of Kelsier.\"\nSo there is another Mistborn, Sazed thought. In this matter, he knew he\nshould remain unbiased. He didn't know enough about this second man to\nmake a judgment—and Keepers were supposed to give information, but\navoid specific advice.\nSazed, however, had never been very good at following that rule. He\ndidn't know this other Mistborn, true, but he did know Elend Venture.\n\"Child,\" he said, \"Elend is the best of men, and you have been so much\nhappier since you've been with him.\"\n\"But, he's really the first man I loved,\" Vin said quietly. \"How do I\nknow it's right? Shouldn't I pay more attention to the man who is a better\nmatch for me?\"\n\"I don't know, Lady Vin. I honestly don't know. I warned you of my\nignorance in this area. But, can you really hope to find a better person than\nLord Elend?\"\nShe sighed. \"It's all so frustrating. I should be worrying about the city"

Sazed sighed, rubbing his eyes as\nhe walked over to the room's door and pulled it open.\nTindwyl stood outside, arms crossed. \"I think I would feel more\ncomfortable in this city,\" she said, \"if I didn't know that our Mistborn had\nthe volatile emotions of a teenage girl.\"\n\"Lady Vin is more stable than you think,\" Sazed said.\n\"Sazed, I've raised some fifteen daughters,\" Tindwyl said, entering the\nroom. \"No teenage girl is stable. Some are just better at hiding it than\nothers.\"\n\"Then, be glad she didn't hear you eavesdropping,\" Sazed said. \"She is\nusually rather paranoid about such things.\"\n\"Vin has a weak spot regarding Terris people,\" Tindwyl said with a\nwave of her hand. \"We can likely thank you for that. She seems to give\ngreat value to your advice.\"\n\"Such as it is.\"\n\"I thought what you said was very wise, Sazed,\" Tindwyl said, sitting.\n\"You would have made an excellent father.\"\nSazed bowed his head in embarrassment, then moved over to sit down.\n\"We should—\"\nA knock came at the door.\n\"Now what?\" Tindwyl asked.\n\"Did you not order us lunch?\"\nTindwyl shook her head. \"I never even left the hallway.\"\nA second later, Elend poked his head into the room. \"Sazed? Could I\ntalk to you for a bit?\"\n\"Of course, Lord Elend,\" Sazed said, rising.\n\"Great,\" Elend said, striding into the room. \"Tindwyl, you are\nexcused.\"\nShe rolled her eyes, shooting an exasperated glance at Sazed, but stood\nand walked from the room.\n\"Thank you,\" Elend said as she shut the door. \"Please, sit,\" he said,\nwaving to Sazed.\nSazed did so, and Elend took a deep breath, standing with hands\nclasped behind his back. He had gone back to his white uniforms, and stood\nwith a commanding posture despite his obvious frustration.\nSomeone stole my friend the scholar away, Sazed thought, and left a\nking in his place. \"I assume this is about Lady Vin, Lord Elend?\"\n\"Yes,\" Elend said, beginning to pace, gesturing with one hand as he\nspoke. \"She doesn't make any sense, Sazed. I expect that—hell, I count on\nit. She's not just female, she's Vin. But, I'm left unsure how to react.

Honestly, Saze, sometimes I just think we're\ntoo different to be together.\"\nSazed smiled. \"Oh, I don't know about that, Lord Elend. You may be\nsurprised at how similarly the two of you think.\"\n\"I doubt that,\" Elend said, continuing to pace. \"She's Mistborn; I'm just\na regular man. She grew up on the streets; I grew up in a mansion. She is\nwily and clever; I'm book-learned.\"\n\"She is extremely competent, and so are you,\" Sazed said. \"She was\noppressed by her brother, you by your father. Both of you hated the Final\nEmpire, and fought it. And both of you think far too much about what\nshould be, rather than what is.\"\nElend paused, looking at Sazed. \"What does that mean?\"\n\"It means that I think you two are right for each other,\" Sazed said. \"I\nam not supposed to make such judgments, and truly, this is just the opinion\nof a man who hasn't seen much of you two in the last few months. But, I\nbelieve it to be true.\"\n\"And our differences?\" Elend asked.\n\"At first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different,\"\nSazed said. \"Different in shape, different in function, different in design.\nThe man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might\nthink them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed.\nYet, upon closer examination, he might see that without one, the other\nbecomes useless. The wise man then sees that both lock and key were\ncreated for the same purpose.\"\nElend smiled. \"You need to write a book sometime, Sazed. That's as\nprofound as anything I've read.\"\nSazed flushed, but glanced at the stack of papers on the desktop.\nWould they be his legacy? He wasn't certain if they were profound, but they\ndid represent the most cohesive attempt that he'd ever made at writing\nsomething original. True, most of the sheets contained quotes or references,\nbut a great deal of the text also included his thoughts and annotations.\n\"So,\" Elend said, \"what should I do?\"\n\"About Lady Vin?\" Sazed asked. \"I would suggest simply giving her—\nand yourself—a little more time.\"\n\"Time is at a premium these days, Saze.\"\n\"When is it not?\"\n\"When your city isn't besieged by two armies,\" Elend said, \"one of\nthem led by a megalomaniac tyrant, the other by a reckless fool.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said slowly. \"Yes, I think you may be right. I should\nreturn to my studies.\"\nElend frowned. \"What are you working on, anyway?\"\n\"Something that has little relevance to your current problem, I fear,\"\nSazed said. \"Tindwyl and I are collecting and compiling references about\nthe Deepness and the Hero of Ages.\"\n\"The Deepness. . .Vin mentioned it, too.

Thank you, Sazed, for your advice.\"\nYes, a king indeed, Sazed thought.\n\"Tindwyl,\" Elend said, \"you may come back in now. Sazed, good day.\"\nElend turned toward the door, and it cracked open slowly. Tindwyl strode\nin, hiding her embarrassment.\n\"How did you know I was out there?\" she asked.\n\"I guessed,\" Elend said. \"You're as bad as Vin. Anyway, good day, both\nof you.\"\nTindwyl frowned as he left; then she glanced at Sazed.\n\"You really did do a fine job with him,\" Sazed said.\n\"Too fine a job,\" Tindwyl said, sitting. \"I actually think that if the\npeople had let him remain in command, he might have found a way to save\nthe city. Come, we must return to work—this time, I actually did send\nsomeone for lunch, so we should get as much done as possible before it\narrives.\"\nSazed nodded, seating himself and picking up his pen. Yet, he found it\ndifficult to focus on his work. His mind kept returning to Vin and Elend. He\nwasn't certain why it was so important to him that they make their\nrelationship work. Perhaps it was simply because they were both friends of\nhis, and he wished to see them happy.\nOr perhaps there was something else. Those two were the best\nLuthadel had to offer. The most powerful Mistborn of the skaa\nunderground, and the most noble leader of the aristocratic culture. They\nneeded each other, and the Final Empire needed them both.\nPlus, there was the work he was doing. The specific pronoun used in\nmuch of the Terris prophetic language was gender neutral. The actual word\nmeant \"it,\" though it was commonly translated into modern tongues as \"he.\"\nYet each \"he\" in his book could also have been written as \"she.\" If Vin\nreally was the Hero of Ages. . .\nI need to find a way to get them out of the city, Sazed thought, a sudden\nrealization washing over him. Those two must not be here when Luthadel\nfalls.\nHe put aside his notes and immediately began writing a quick series of\nletters.\nThe two are not the same.\n46\nBREEZE COULD SMELL INTRIGUE FROM two streets away.\nUnlike many of his fellow thieves, he hadn't grown up impoverished, nor\nhad he been forced to live in the underground. He'd grown up in a place far\nmore cutthroat: an aristocratic court.

Things that he\ndoubted any skaa thief, no matter how competent, knew. Skaa intrigue\nmade a brutal kind of sense; it was a matter of naked life and death. You\nbetrayed your allies for money, for power, or to protect yourself.\nIn the noble courts, intrigue was more abstract. Betrayals wouldn't\noften end with either party dead, but the ramifications could span\ngenerations. It was a game—so much of one, in fact, that the young Breeze\nhad found the open brutality of the skaa underground to be refreshing.\nHe sipped his warm mug of mulled wine, eyeing the note in his\nfingers. He'd come to believe that he wouldn't have to worry about\nintracrew conspiracies anymore: Kelsier's crew was an almost sickeningly\ntight group, and Breeze did everything within his Allomantic powers to\nkeep it that way. He'd seen what infighting could do to a family.\nThat was why he was so surprised to receive this letter. Despite its\nmock innocence, he could easily pick out the signs. The hurried pace of the\nwriting, smudged in places but not rewritten. Phrases like \"No need to tell\nothers of this\" and \"do not wish to cause alarm.\" The extra drops of sealing\nwax, spread gratuitously on the lip of the letter, as if to give extra protection\nagainst prying eyes.\nThere was no mistaking the tone of the missive. Breeze had been\ninvited to a conspiratorial conference. But, why in the Lord Ruler's name\nwould Sazed, of all people, want to meet in secret?\nBreeze sighed, pulling out his dueling cane and using it to steady\nhimself. He grew light-headed sometimes when he stood; it was a minor\nmalady he'd always had, though it seemed to have grown worse during the\nlast few years. He glanced over his shoulder as his vision cleared, toward\nwhere Allrianne slept in his bed.\nI should probably feel more guilty about her, he thought, smiling\ndespite himself and reaching to put his vest and jacket on over his trousers\nand shirt. But. . .well, we're all going to be dead in a few days anyway. An\nafternoon spent speaking with Clubs could certainly put one's life in\nperspective.\nBreeze wandered out into the hallway, making his way though the\ngloomy, inadequately lit Venture passageways. Honestly, he thought, I\nunderstand the value in saving lamp oil, but things are depressing enough\nright now without the dark corridors.\nThe meeting place was only a few short twists away. Breeze located it\neasily because of the two soldiers standing watch outside the door.\nDemoux's men—soldiers who reported to the captain religiously, as well as\nvocationally.\nInteresting, Breeze thought, remaining hidden in the side hallway. He\nquested out with his Allomantic powers and Soothed the men, taking away\ntheir relaxation and certainty, leaving behind anxiety and nervousness. The\nguards began to grow restless, shuffling.

Finally, one turned and opened the\ndoor, checking on the room inside. The motion gave Breeze a full view of\nthe room's contents. Only one man sat within. Sazed.\nBreeze stood quietly, trying to decide his next course of action. There\nwas nothing incriminating in the letter; this couldn't all simply be a trap on\nElend's part, could it? An obscure attempt at finding out which\ncrewmembers would betray him and which wouldn't? Seemed like too\ndistrustful a move for the good-natured boy. Besides, if that were the case,\nSazed would have to try and get Breeze to do more than simply meet in a\nclandestine location.\nThe door swung closed, the soldier returning to his place. I can trust\nSazed, can't I? Breeze thought. But, if that was the case, why the quiet\nmeeting? Was Breeze overreacting?\nNo, the guards proved that Sazed worried about this meeting being\ndiscovered. It was suspicious. If it were anyone else, Breeze would have\ngone straight to Elend. But Sazed. . .\nBreeze sighed, then wandered into the hallway, dueling cane clicking\nagainst the floor. Might as well see what he has to say. Besides, if he is\nplanning something devious, it'd almost be worth the danger to see it.\nDespite the letter, despite the strange circumstances, Breeze had trouble\nimagining a Terrisman being involved in something that wasn't completely\nhonest.\nPerhaps the Lord Ruler had had the same problem.\nBreeze nodded to the soldiers, Soothing away their anxiety and\nrestoring them to a more temperate humor. There was another reason why\nhe was willing to chance the meeting. Breeze was only just beginning to\nrealize how dangerous his predicament was. Luthadel would soon fall.\nEvery instinct he'd nurtured during thirty years in the underground was\ntelling him to run.\nThat feeling made him more likely to take risks. The Breeze of a few\nyears earlier would already have abandoned the city. Damn you, Kelsier, he\nthought as he pushed open the door.\nSazed looked up with surprise from his table. The room was sparse,\nwith several chairs and only two lamps. \"You're early, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed\nsaid, standing quickly.\n\"Of course I am,\" Breeze snapped. \"I had to make certain this wasn't a\ntrap of some sort.\" He paused. \"This isn't a trap of some sort, right?\"\n\"Trap?\" Sazed asked. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"Oh, don't sound so shocked,\" Breeze said. \"This is no simple\nmeeting.\"\nSazed wilted slightly. \"It's. . .that obvious, is it?\"\nBreeze sat, laying his cane across his lap, and eyed Sazed tellingly,\nSoothing the man to make him feel a little more self-conscious. \"You may\nhave helped us overthrow the Lord Ruler, my dear man—but you have a lot\nto learn about being sneaky.\"\n\"I apologize,\" Sazed said, sitting. \"I simply wanted to meet quickly, to\ndiscuss certain. . .sensitive issues.\"\n\"Well, I'd recommend getting rid of those guards,\" Breeze said. \"They"

He eyed Breeze, then Sazed,\nthen wandered over toward a chair. Breeze glanced at Sazed—no surprise\nthere. Clubs was obviously invited as well.\n\"Lose those guards,\" Clubs snapped.\n\"Immediately, Lord Cladent,\" Sazed said, standing and shuffling over\nto the door. He spoke briefly with the guards, then returned. As Sazed was\nsitting, Ham poked his head into the room, looking suspicious.\n\"Wait a minute,\" Breeze said. \"How many people are coming to this\nsecret meeting?\"\nSazed gestured for Ham to sit. \"All of the more. . .experienced\nmembers of the crew.\"\n\"You mean everyone but Elend and Vin,\" Breeze said.\n\"I did not invite Lord Lestibournes either,\" Sazed said.\nYes, but Spook isn't the one we're hiding from.\nHam sat down hesitantly, shooting a questioning glance at Breeze. \"So.\n. .why exactly are we meeting behind the backs of our Mistborn and our\nking?\"\n\"King no longer,\" a voice noted from the door. Dockson walked in and\nsat. \"In fact, it could be argued that Elend isn't leader of this crew anymore.\nHe fell into that position by happenstance—just like he fell into the throne.\"\nHam flushed. \"I know you don't like him, Dox, but I'm not here to talk\ntreason.\"\n\"There's no treason if there's no throne to betray,\" Dockson said,\nsitting. \"What are we going to do—stay here and be servants in his house?\nElend doesn't need us. Perhaps it's time to transfer our services to Lord\nPenrod.\"\n\"Penrod is a nobleman, too,\" Ham said. \"You can't tell me you like him\nany better than you do Elend.\"\nDockson thumped the table quietly with his fist. \"It's not about who I\nlike, Ham. It's about seeing that this damn kingdom Kelsier threw at us\nremains standing! We've spent a year and a half cleaning up his mess. Do\nyou want to see that work wasted?\"\n\"Please, gentlemen,\" Sazed said, trying—without success—to break\ninto the conversation.\n\"Work, Dox?\" Ham said, flushed. \"What work have you done? I\nhaven't seen you do much of anything besides sit and complain every time\nsomeone offers a plan.\"\n\"Complain?\" Dockson snapped. \"Do you have any idea how much\nadministrative work it has taken to keep this city from falling upon itself?"

That's the real reason you\nnever liked Elend, isn't it?\"\nDockson flushed, and Breeze sighed, slapping both of them with a\npowerful blanket Soothing. They both jumped slightly, as if they'd been\nstung—though the sensation would be quite the opposite. Their emotions,\nonce volatile, would suddenly have become numb and unresponsive.\nBoth looked at Breeze.\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"of course I'm Soothing you. Honestly, I know\nHammond is a bit immature—but you, Dockson?\"\nDockson sat back, rubbing his forehead. \"You can let go, Breeze,\" he\nsaid after a moment. \"I'll keep my tongue.\"\nHam just grumbled, settling one hand on the table. Sazed watched the\nexchange with a little bit of shock.\nThis is what cornered men are like, my dear Terrisman, Breeze\nthought. This is what happens when they lose hope. They might be able to\nkeep up appearances in front of the soldiers, but put them alone with their\nfriends. . .\nSazed was a Terrisman; his entire life had been one of oppression and\nloss. But these men, Breeze himself included, were accustomed to success.\nEven against overwhelming odds, they were confident. They were the type\nof men who could go up against a god, and expect to win. They wouldn't\ndeal well with losing. Of course, when losing meant death, who would?\n\"Straff's armies are getting ready to break camp,\" Clubs finally said.\n\"He's doing it subtly, but the signs are there.\"\n\"So, he's coming for the city,\" Dockson said. \"My men in Penrod's\npalace say the Assembly has been sending missive after missive to Straff,\nall but begging him to come take up occupation of Luthadel.\"\n\"He's not going to take the city,\" Clubs said. \"At least, not if he's\nsmart.\""

So, he'll do something\nelse.\"\nDockson frowned, and glanced at Ham, who shrugged.\n\"It's really quite simple,\" Breeze said, tapping the table with his\ndueling cane. \"Why, even I figured it out.\" Clubs snorted at this. \"If Straff\nmakes it look like he's withdrawing, the koloss will probably attack\nLuthadel for him.

They'd pillage the richest sectors of\nthe town—probably end up killing most of the noblemen in the city.\"\n\"Eliminating the men that Straff has been forced—against his will,\nknowing that man's pride—to work with,\" Breeze added. \"In fact, there's a\ngood chance the creatures will kill Vin.

That will leave Straff\nwith a clear field to attack a weakened foe. Plus, koloss don't strategize—\nfor them, city walls won't be much help. Straff couldn't ask for a better\nsetup.\"\n\"He'd be seen as a liberator,\" Breeze said quietly. \"If he returns at the\nright time—after the koloss have broken into the city and fought the\nsoldiers, but before they've done serious damage to the skaa quarter—he\ncould free the people and establish himself as their protector, not their\nconqueror.

What else\nare we going to do?\"\n\"Fight,\" Clubs said. \"And die.\"\nThe room fell silent again.\n\"You sure know how to kill a conversation, my friend,\" Breeze finally\nsaid.\n\"It needed to be said,\" Clubs muttered. \"No use fooling yourselves\nanymore. We can't win a fight, and a fight is where this was always going.\nThe city is going to get attacked. We're going to defend it. And we'll lose.\n\"You wonder if we should just give up. Well, we're not going to do\nthat. Kell wouldn't let us, and so we won't let ourselves. We'll fight, and\nwe'll die with dignity. Then, the city will burn—but we'll have said\nsomething. The Lord Ruler pushed us around for a thousand years, but now\nwe skaa have pride. We fight. We resist. And we die.\"\n\"What was this all worth, then?\" Ham said with frustration. \"Why\noverthrow the Final Empire? Why kill the Lord Ruler? Why do anything, if\nit was just going to end like this? Tyrants ruling every dominance, Luthadel\nsmashed to rubble, our crew dead?\"\n\"Because,\" Sazed said softly, \"someone had to begin it. While the Lord\nRuler ruled, society could not progress. He kept a stabilizing hand on the\nempire, but it was an oppressive hand as well. Fashion stayed remarkably\nunchanged for a thousand years, the noblemen always trying to fit the Lord\nRuler's ideals. Architecture and science did not progress, for the Lord Ruler\nfrowned on change and invention.\n\"And the skaa could not be free, for he would not let them. However,\nkilling him did not free our peoples, my friends. Only time will do that. It\nwill take centuries, perhaps—centuries of fighting, learning, and growth. At\nthe beginning, unfortunately and unavoidably, things will be very difficult.\nWorse even than they were beneath the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"And we die for nothing,\" Ham said with a scowl.\n\"No,\" Sazed said. \"Not nothing, Lord Hammond. We will die to show\nthat there are skaa who will not be bullied, who will not back down. This is\na very important precedent, I think. In the histories and legends, this is the\nkind of event that inspires. If the skaa are ever to take rule of themselves,\nthere will need to be sacrifices they can look to for motivation. Sacrifices\nlike that of the Survivor himself.\"\nThe men sat in silence.\n\"Breeze,\" Ham said, \"I could use a little more confidence right now.\"\n\"Of course,\" Breeze said, carefully Soothing away the man's anxiety\nand fear. His face lost some of its pale pallor, and he sat up a little\nstraighter. Just for good measure, Breeze gave the rest of the crew a little of\nthe same treatment.\n\"How long have you known?\" Dockson asked Sazed.\n\"For some time now, Lord Dockson,\" Sazed said."

Only Clubs figured that out.\"\n\"My knowledge was general, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said in his even\nvoice. \"It did not relate to the koloss specifically. I have thought for some\ntime that this city would fall. In all honesty, I am deeply impressed with\nyour efforts. This people should long since have been defeated, I think. You\nhave done something grand—something that will be remembered for\ncenturies.\"\n\"Assuming anyone survives to tell the story,\" Clubs noted.\nSazed nodded. \"That, actually, is why I called this gathering. There is\nlittle chance of those of us who remain in the city surviving—we will be\nneeded to help with defenses, and if we do survive the koloss attack, Straff\nwill try to execute us. However, it is not necessary for us all to remain in\nLuthadel for its fall—someone, perhaps, should be sent out to organize\nfurther resistance against the warlords.\"\n\"I won't leave my men,\" Clubs grumbled.\n\"Nor I,\" Ham said. \"Though I did send my family to ground\nyesterday.\" The simple phrase meant that he'd had them leave, perhaps to\nhide in the city's underground, perhaps to escape through one of the\npasswalls. Ham wouldn't know—and that way he couldn't betray their\nlocation. Old habits died hard.\n\"If this city falls,\" Dockson said, \"I'll be here with it. That's what Kell\nwould expect. I'm not leaving.\"\n\"I'll go,\" Breeze said, looking at Sazed. \"Is it too early to volunteer?\"\n\"Um, actually, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said, \"I wasn't—\"\nBreeze held up a hand. \"It's all right, Sazed. I believe it's obvious\nwhom you think should be sent away. You didn't invite them to the\nmeeting.\"\nDockson frowned. \"We're going to defend Luthadel to the death, and\nyou want to send away our only Mistborn?\"\nSazed nodded his head. \"My lords,\" he said softly, \"the men of this city\nwill need our leadership. We gave them this city and put them in this\npredicament. We cannot abandon them now. But. . .there are great things at\nwork in this world. Greater things than us, I think. I am convinced that\nMistress Vin is part of them.\n\"Even if these matters are delusions on my part, then Lady Vin still\nmust not be allowed to die in this city. She is the people's most personal and\npowerful link to the Survivor. She has become a symbol to them, and her\nskills as a Mistborn give her the best chance of being able to get away, then\nsurvive the attacks Straff will undoubtedly send. She will be a great value in\nthe fight to come—she can move quickly and stealthily, and can fight alone,\ndoing much damage, as she proved last night.\"\nSazed bowed his head. \"My lords, I called you here today so that we\ncould decide how to convince her to run, when the rest of us stay to fight.

Neither Straff nor\nJastes are likely to allow large groups of people to flee the city. Right now,\nconfusion and fear in the streets will serve their purposes far better than\ndepopulation.

But, somehow, the possibility that some\nwould escape—the youngest crewmembers, the ones still inexperienced\nenough to hope—made everything else a little easier to accept.\nVin stood quietly in the mists, looking up at the dark spires, columns,\nand towers of Kredik Shaw. In her head, two sounds thumped. The mist\nspirit and the larger, vaster sound.\nIt was growing more and more demanding.\nShe continued forward, ignoring the thumps as she approached Kredik\nShaw. The Hill of a Thousand Spires, once home of the Lord Ruler. It had\nbeen abandoned for well over a year, but no vagrants had made their home\nhere. It was too ominous. Too terrible. Too much a reminder of him.\nThe Lord Ruler had been a monster. Vin remembered well the night,\nover a year before, when she had come to this palace intending to kill him.\nTo do the job that Kelsier had unwittingly trained her to do. She had walked\nthrough this very courtyard, had passed guards at the doors before her.\nAnd she had let them live. Kelsier would have just fought his way in.\nBut Vin had talked them into leaving, into joining the rebellion. That act\nhad saved her life when one of those very men, Goradel, had led Elend to\nthe palace dungeons to help rescue Vin.\nIn a way, the Final Empire had been overthrown because she hadn't\nacted like Kelsier.\nAnd yet, could she base future decisions upon a coincidence like that?\nLooking back, it seemed too perfectly allegorical. Like a neat little tale told\nto children, intended to teach a lesson.\nVin had never heard those tales as a child. And, she had survived when\nso many others had died. For every lesson like the one with Goradel, it\nseemed that there were a dozen that ended in tragedy.\nAnd then there was Kelsier. He'd been right, in the end. His lesson was\nvery different from the ones taught by the children's tales. Kelsier had been\nbold, even excited, when he executed those who stood in his path. Ruthless.\nHe had looked toward the greater good; he'd always had his eyes focused on\nthe fall of the empire, and the eventual rise of a kingdom like Elend's.\nHe had succeeded. Why couldn't she kill as he had, knowing she was\ndoing her duty, never feeling guilt? She'd always been frightened by the\nedge of danger Kelsier had displayed. Yet, wasn't that very edge the thing\nthat had let him succeed?\nShe passed into the tunnel-like corridors of the palace, feet and\nmistcloak tassels trailing marks in the dust.

She didn't like the decision, but she was\naccustomed to doing things she didn't like. That was life. She hadn't wanted\nto fight the Lord Ruler, but she had.\nIt soon became too dark even for Mistborn eyes, and she had to light a\nlantern. When she did, she was surprised to see that her footsteps weren't\nthe only ones in the dust. Apparently, someone else had been haunting the\ncorridors. However, whoever it was, she didn't encounter them as she\nwalked through the hallways.\nShe entered the chamber a few moments later. She wasn't sure what\nhad drawn her to Kredik Shaw, let alone the hidden chamber at its center. It\nseemed, however, that she had been feeling a kinship with the Lord Ruler\nlately. Her walkings had brought her here, to a place she hadn't visited since\nthat night when she'd slain the only God she'd ever known.\nHe had spent a lot of time in this hidden chamber, a place he had\napparently built to remind him of his homeland. The chamber had a domed\nroof that arced overhead. The walls were filled with silvery murals and the\nfloor was filled with metallic inlays. She ignored these, walking forward\ntoward the room's central feature—a small stone building that had been\nbuilt within the larger chamber.\nIt was here that Kelsier and his wife had been captured many years\nbefore, during Kelsier's first attempt to rob the Lord Ruler. Mare had been\nmurdered at the Pits. But Kelsier had survived.\nIt was here, in this same chamber, that Vin had first faced an Inquisitor,\nand had nearly been killed herself. It was also here that she had come\nmonths later in her first attempt to kill the Lord Ruler. She had been\ndefeated that time, too.\nShe stepped into the small building-within-a-building. It had only one\nroom. The floor had been torn up by Elend's crews, searching for the atium.\nThe walls were still hung, however, with the trappings the Lord Ruler had\nleft behind. She raised her lantern, looking at them.\nRugs. Furs. A small wooden flute. The things of his people, the Terris\npeople, from a thousand years before. Why had he built his new city of\nLuthadel here, to the south, when his homeland—and the Well of Ascension\nitself—had been to the north? Vin had never really understood that.\nPerhaps it came down to decision. Rashek, the Lord Ruler, had been\nforced to make a decision, too. He could have continued as he was, the\npastoral villager. He would probably have had a happy life with his people.\nBut he had decided to become something more. In doing so, he had\ncommitted terrible atrocities. Yet, could she blame him for the decision\nitself? He had become what he'd thought he needed to be.\nHer decision seemed more mundane, but she knew that other things—"

Elend was the one she wanted to be with. He\nrepresented peace. Happiness. Zane, however, represented what she felt she\nhad to become. For the good of everyone involved.\nThe Lord Ruler's palace held no clues or answers for her. A few\nmoments later, frustrated and baffled at why she had even come, she left it\nbehind, walking back out into the mists.\nZane awoke to the sound of a tent spike being pounded in a specific\nrhythm. His reaction was immediate.\nHe burned steel and pewter. He always swallowed a new bit of each\nbefore sleeping. He knew the habit would probably kill him someday;\nmetals were poisonous if allowed to linger.\nDying someday was better, in Zane's opinion, than dying today.\nHe flipped out of his cot, tossing his blanket toward the opening tent\nflap. He could barely see in the darkness of night. Even as he jumped, he\nheard something ripping. The tent walls being slit.\n\"Kill them!\" God screamed.\nZane thumped to the ground and grabbed a handful of coins from the\nbowl beside his bed. He heard cries of surprise as he spun, throwing coins\nin a spinning spray around him.\nHe Pushed. Tiny plunks of sound thumped around him as coins met\ncanvas, then continued on.\nAnd men began to scream.\nZane fell to a crouch, waiting silently as the tent collapsed around him.\nSomeone was thrashing the cloth to his right. He shot a few coins, and\nheard a satisfying grunt of pain. In the stillness, canvas resting atop him like\na blanket, he heard footsteps running away.\nHe sighed, relaxing, and used a dagger to slice away the top of his tent.\nHe emerged to a misty night. He'd gone to sleep later today than he usually\ndid; it was probably near midnight. Time to be up anyway.\nHe strode across the fallen top of his tent—moving over to the now\ncloaked form of his cot—and cut a hole so he could reach through and\npluck out the vial of metal he'd stored in a pocket beneath it. He downed the\nmetals, and tin brought near light to his surroundings. Four men lay dying\nor dead around his tent. They were soldiers, of course—Straff's soldiers.\nThe attack had come later than Zane had expected.\nStraff trusts me more than I assumed. Zane stepped over the dead form\nof an assassin and cut his way into a storage chest, then pulled out his\nclothing. He changed quietly, then removed a small bag of coins from the\nchest. It must have been the attack on Cett's keep, he thought. It finally\nconvinced Straff that I was too dangerous to let live.\nZane found his man working quietly beside a tent a short distance"

He watched every night,\npaid to pound on a tent spike should anyone approach Zane's tent. Zane\ntossed the man a bag of coins, then moved off into the darkness, passing the\ncanal waters with their supply barges on his way to Straff's tent.\nHis father had some few limitations. Straff was fine at large-scale\nplanning, but the details—the subtleties—often got away from him. He\ncould organize an army and crush his enemies. He, however, liked to play\nwith dangerous tools. Like the atium mines at the Pits of Hathsin. Like\nZane.\nThose tools often ended up burning him.\nZane walked up to the side of Straff's tent, then ripped a hole in the\ncanvas and strode in. Straff waited for him. Zane gave the man credit: Straff\nwatched his death coming with defiance in his eyes. Zane stopped in the\nmiddle of the room, in front of Straff, who sat in his hard wooden chair.\n\"Kill him,\" God commanded.\nLamps burned in the corners, illuminating the canvas. The cushions\nand blankets in the corner were rumpled; Straff had taken one last romp\nwith his favorite mistresses before sending his assassins. The king displayed\nhis characteristic air of strong defiance, but Zane saw more. He saw a face\ntoo slick with sweat, and he saw hands trembling, as if from a disease.\n\"I have atium for you,\" Straff said. \"Buried in a place only I know.\"\nZane stood quietly, staring at his father.\n\"I will proclaim you openly,\" Straff said. \"Name you my heir.\nTomorrow, if you wish.\"\nZane didn't respond. Straff continued to sweat.\n\"The city is yours,\" Zane finally said, turning away.\nHe was rewarded with a startled gasp from behind.\nZane glanced back. He'd never seen such a look of shock on his\nfather's face. That alone was almost worth everything.\n\"Pull your men back, as you are planning,\" Zane said, \"but don't return\nto the Northern Dominance. Wait for those koloss to invade the city, let\nthem take down the defenses and kill the defenders. Then, you can sweep in\nand rescue Luthadel.\"\n\"But, Elend's Mistborn. . .\"\n\"Will be gone,\" Zane said. \"She's leaving with me, tonight. Farewell,\nFather.\" He turned and left through the slit he'd made.\n\"Zane?\" Straff called from inside the tent.\nZane paused again.\n\"Why?\" Straff asked, looking out through the slit. \"I sent assassins to\nkill you. Why are you letting me live?\"\n\"Because you're my father,\" Zane said. He turned away, looking into\nthe mists. \"A man shouldn't kill his father.\"\nWith that, Zane bid a final farewell to the man who had created him.

The truth is, he was never worthy of you.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, shaking her head. \"That's not it at all, Zane. You don't\nunderstand. I was never worthy of him. Elend deserves someone better. He\ndeserves. . .someone who shares his ideals. Someone who thinks he was\nright to give up his throne. Someone who sees more honor—and less\nfoolishness—in that.\"\n\"Either way,\" Zane said, stopping a short distance from her. \"He\ncannot understand you. Us.\"\nVin didn't reply.\n\"Where would you go, Vin?\" Zane asked. \"If you weren't bound to this\nplace, bound to him? If you were free, and could do whatever you wished,\nwhere would you go?\"\nThe thumpings seemed louder. She glanced toward OreSeur, who sat\nquietly by the side wall, mostly in the dark. Why feel guilty? What did she\nhave to prove to him?\nShe turned back to Zane. \"North,\" she said. \"To Terris.\"\n\"We can go there. Wherever you want. Location is irrelevant to me, as\nlong as it is not this place.\"\n\"I can't abandon them,\" Vin said.\n\"Even if by doing so, you steal away Straff's only Mistborn?\" Zane\nasked. \"The trade is a good one. My father will know that I have\ndisappeared, but he will not realize that you aren't still in Luthadel. He'll be\neven more afraid to attack. By giving yourself freedom, you'll also be\nleaving your allies with a precious gift.\"\nZane took her hand, forcing her to look at him. He did look like Elend\n—like a hard version of Elend. Zane had been broken by life, just as she\nhad been, but both had put themselves back together. Had the re-forming\nmade them stronger, or more fragile?\n\"Come,\" Zane whispered. \"You can save me, Vin.\"\nA war is coming to the city, Vin thought with a chill. If I stay, I will\nhave to kill again.\nAnd slowly, she let him draw her away from her desk, toward the mists\nand the comforting darkness beyond. She reached up, pulling out a metal\nvial for the journey, and the motion caused Zane to spin suspiciously."

Vin followed him, walking again, but she felt a sudden stab of fear.\nThis is it, she thought. After this, everything changes. The time for decisions\nhas passed.\nAnd I made the wrong choice.\nElend wouldn't have jumped like that when I took out the vial.\nShe froze. Zane tugged on her wrist, but she didn't move. He turned\ntoward her in the mists, frowning as he stood at the edge of her balcony.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Vin whispered, slipping her hand free. \"I can't go with\nyou.\"\n\"What?\" Zane asked. \"Why not?\"\nVin shook her head, turning and walking back into the room.\n\"Tell me what it is!\" Zane said, tone rising. \"What is it about him that\ndraws you? He isn't a great leader. He's not a warrior. He's no Allomancer or\ngeneral. What is it about him?\"\nThe answer came to her simply and easily. Make your decisions—I'll\nsupport you in them. \"He trusts me,\" she whispered.\n\"What?\" Zane asked incredulously.\n\"When I attacked Cett,\" Vin said, \"the others thought I was acting\nirrationally—and they were right. But Elend told them I had a good reason,\neven if he didn't know what it was.\"\n\"So he's a fool,\" Zane said.\n\"When we spoke later,\" Vin continued, not looking at Zane, \"I was\ncold to him. I think he knew that I was trying to decide whether to stay with\nhim or not. And. . .he told me that he trusted my judgment. He'd support me\nif I chose to leave him.\"\n\"So he's also unappreciative,\" Zane said.\nVin shook her head. \"No. He just loves me.\"\n\"I love you.\"\nVin paused, looking at Zane. He looked angry. Desperate, even. \"I\nbelieve you. I still can't go with you.\"\n\"But why?\"\n\"Because it would require leaving Elend,\" she said. \"Even if I can't\nshare his ideals, I can respect them. Even if I don't deserve him, I can be\nnear him. I'm staying, Zane.\"\nZane stood quietly for a moment, mist falling around his shoulders.\n\"I've failed, then.\"\nVin turned away from him. \"No. It isn't that you've failed. You aren't\nflawed simply because I—\"\nHe slammed into her, throwing her toward the mist-covered floor. Vin\nturned her head, shocked, as she crashed into the wooden floor, the breath\ngoing out of her.\nZane loomed above her, his face dark. \"You were supposed to save\nme,\" he hissed.\nVin flared every metal she had in a sudden jolt.

She flew backward\nand hit the door hard, the wood cracking slightly, but she was too tense—\ntoo shocked—to feel anything but the thud.\nZane rose quietly, standing tall, dark. Vin rolled forward into a crouch.\nZane was attacking her. Attacking her for real.\nBut. . .he. . .\n\"OreSeur!\" Vin said, ignoring her mind's objections, whipping out her\ndaggers. \"Run away!\"\nThe code given, she charged, trying to distract Zane's attention from\nthe wolfhound. Zane sidestepped her attacks with a casual grace. Vin\nwhipped a dagger toward his neck. It barely missed as Zane tipped his head\nbackward. She struck at his side, at his arm, at his chest. Each strike missed.\nShe'd known he'd burn atium. She'd expected that. She skidded to a\nstop, looking at him. He hadn't even bothered to pull out his own weapons.\nHe stood before her, face dark, mist a growing lake at his feet. \"Why didn't\nyou listen to me, Vin?\" he asked. \"Why force me to keep being Straff's tool?\nWe both know where that must lead.\"\nVin ignored him. Gritting her teeth, she launched into an attack. Zane\nbackhanded her indifferently, and she Pushed slightly against the\ndeskmounts behind him—tossing herself backward, as if thrown by the\nforce of his blow. She slammed into the wall, then slumped to the ground.\nDirectly beside the startled OreSeur.\nHe hadn't opened his shoulder to give her the atium. Hadn't he\nunderstood the code? \"The atium I gave you,\" Vin hissed. \"I need it. Now.\"\n\"Kandra,\" Zane said. \"Come to me.\"\nOreSeur met her eyes, and she saw something within them. Shame. He\nglanced away, then padded across the floor, mist up to his knees, as he\njoined Zane in the center of the room.\n\"No. . .\" Vin whispered. \"OreSeur—\"\n\"You will no longer obey her commands, TenSoon,\" Zane said.\nOreSeur bowed his head.\n\"The Contract, OreSeur!\" Vin said, climbing to her knees. \"You must\nobey my orders!\"\n\"My servant, Vin,\" Zane said. \"My Contract. My orders.\"\nMy servant. . ..\nAnd suddenly, it clicked. She'd suspected everyone—Dockson, Breeze,\neven Elend—but she'd never connected the spy to the one person that made\nthe most sense. There had been a kandra in the palace all along. And he had\nbeen at her side.\n\"I'm sorry, Mistress,\" OreSeur whispered.\n\"How long?\" Vin asked, bowing her head.\n\"Since you gave my predecessor—the real OreSeur—the dog's body,\"\nthe kandra said. \"I killed him that day and took his place, wearing the body\nof a dog. You never saw him as a wolfhound.\"\nWhat easier way to mask the transformation?

She'd assumed all along that the\nswitch must have happened that day, when she was with Elend on the city\nwall—but she'd done so primarily because of what OreSeur had said.\nIdiot! she thought. OreSeur—or, TenSoon, as Zane had called him—\nhad led her to suspect everyone but himself. What was wrong with her? She\nwas usually so good at sniffing out traitors, at noticing insincerity. How had\nshe missed spotting her own kandra?\nZane walked forward. Vin waited, on her knees. Weak, she told herself.\nLook weak. Make him leave you alone. Try to—\n\"Soothing me will do no good,\" Zane said quietly, grabbing her by the\nfront of her shirt, picking her up, then throwing her back down. Mist\nsprayed beneath her, puffing up in a splash as she slammed to the floor. Vin\nstifled her cry of pain.\nI have to stay quiet. If guards come, he'll kill them. If Elend comes. . .\nShe had to stay quiet, quiet even as Zane kicked her in her wounded\nside. She grunted, eyes watering.\n\"You could have saved me,\" Zane said, peering down at her. \"I was\nwilling to go with you. Now, what is left? Nothing. Nothing, but Straff's\norders.\" He punctuated that sentence with a kick.\nStay small, she told herself through the pain. He'll leave you alone\neventually. . ..\nBut it had been years since she'd had to bow before anyone. Her days\nof cringing before Camon and Reen were almost misty shadows, forgotten\nbefore the light offered by Elend and Kelsier. As Zane kicked again, Vin\nfound herself growing angry.\nHe brought his foot back, angling it toward her face, and Vin moved.\nAs his foot arced down, she threw herself backward, Pushing against the\nwindow latches to scoot herself through the mists. She flared pewter,\nthrowing herself up to her feet, trailing mist from the floor. It was up past\nher knees now.\nShe glared at Zane, who looked back with a dark expression. Vin\nducked forward, but Zane moved faster—moved first—stepping between\nher and the balcony. Not that getting to it would do her any good; with\natium, he could chase her down easily.\nIt was like before, when he'd attacked her with atium. Only this time it\nwas worse. Before, she'd been able to believe—if just a little—that they\nwere still sparring. Still not enemies, even if they weren't friends. She hadn't\nreally believed that he wanted to kill her.\nShe had no such illusions this time. Zane's eyes were dark, his\nexpression flat—just like that night a few days before, when slaughtering\nCett's men.\nVin was going to die.\nShe hadn't felt such fear in a long time.

There was no chance.\nNo, she told herself forcefully, holding her side. Elend didn't back\ndown against Straff. He doesn't have Allomancy, but he marched into the\ncenter of the koloss camp.\nI can beat this.\nWith a cry, Vin dashed toward TenSoon. The dog backed away in\nshock, but he needn't have worried. Zane was there again. He slammed a\nshoulder into Vin, then whipped his dagger around and slashed a wound\nacross her cheek as she fell backward. The cut was precise. Perfect.\nMatching the wound on her other cheek, one given to her during her first\nfight with a Mistborn, nearly two years before.\nVin gritted her teeth, burning iron as she fell. She Pulled on a pouch on\nher desk, whipping the coins into her hand. She hit the ground on her side,\nother hand down, and threw herself back to her feet. She dumped a shower\nof coins from the pouch into her hand, then raised them at Zane.\nBlood dripped from her chin. She threw the coins out.

The coins snapped\nforward, and the wind of their sudden passing parted the mist on the\nground, revealing the floor beneath.\nThe room shook.\nAnd in an eyeblink, Vin found herself slammed back against the wall.\nShe gasped in surprise, breath knocked from her lungs, her vision\nswimming.

We deduced you must have a new metal from\nthe way you can sense me when my copper is on. After that, a little\nsearching, and he found that note from your metallurgist, which handily had\nthe instructions for making duralumin.\"\nHer addled mind struggled to connect ideas. Zane had duralumin. He'd\nused the metal, and had Pushed against one of the coins she'd shot at him.\nHe must have Pushed behind himself as well, to keep from being forced\nbackward as his weight met hers.\nAnd her own duralumin-enhanced Push had slammed her against the\nwall.

Through her\nterror, she reached out for the mists, as she had over a year before when\nfighting the Lord Ruler. That day, they had fueled her Allomancy, giving her\na strength that she shouldn't have had.

The mists continued to ignore her\npleas.\nShe twisted, Pulling against the window frame to get leverage, and\npushed Zane to the side.

He was on top again—or, rather, he\nwas on the bottom, but that was now the point of leverage.\nVin gasped. He was so strong. Stronger than she. His fingers bit into\nthe flesh of her arms despite her pewter, and her side ached from her earlier\nwounds.

The voice, the pain, brought lucidity\nto Vin. She flared tin, using the pain to shock herself awake, clearing her\nmind.\n\"What?\" Zane asked, looking down toward the kandra.\n\"She knows, Master,\" TenSoon said. \"She knows our secret.

Somehow, not quite\nknowing how, she ordered him forward, controlling his body.\nThe massive wolfhound's body slammed into Zane, throwing him off\nVin. The dagger flipped to the ground, and Vin stumbled to her knees,\ngrabbing her chest, feeling warm blood there.

She snatched the dagger off the ground as he rolled to her feet, then\nplunged it into his shoulder, cutting the shoulder, her fingers feeling in the\nmuscle and sinew. She came up with bloodied hands and a single bead of\natium. She swallowed it with a gulp, spinning toward Zane.\n\"Now let's see how you fare,\" she hissed, burning atium. Dozens of\natium shadows burst from Zane, showing her possible actions he could take\n—all of them ambiguous. She would be giving off the same confusing mess\nto his eyes. They were even.\nZane turned, looking into her eyes, and his atium shadows\ndisappeared.\nImpossible! she thought. TenSoon groaned at her feet as she realized\nthat her atium reserve was gone.

That let me kill\nhim.\"\n\"Mistress. . .\" TenSoon whispered. \"That is brilliant.\"\n\"I'm sure I'm not the first to think of it,\" Vin said wearily. \"But it isn't\nthe sort of secret that you share. Anyway, take his body.\"\n\"I. . .would rather not wear the bones of that creature,\" TenSoon said.\n\"You don't know how broken he was, Mistress.\"\nVin nodded tiredly. \"I could just find you another dog body, if you\nwant.\"\n\"That won't be necessary, Mistress,\" TenSoon said quietly. \"I still have\nthe bones of the other wolfhound you gave me, and most of them are still\ngood. If I replace a few of them with the good bones from this body, I\nshould be able to form a complete skeleton to use.\"\n\"Do it, then. We're going to need to plan what to do next.\"\nTenSoon was quiet for a moment. Finally, he spoke. \"Mistress, my\nContract is void, now that my master is dead. I. . .need to return to my\npeople for reassignment.\"\n\"Ah,\" Vin said, feeling a wrench of sadness. \"Of course.\"\n\"I do not want to go,\" TenSoon said. \"But, I must at least report to my\npeople. Please, forgive me.\"\n\"There is nothing to forgive,\" Vin said. \"And thank you for that timely\nhint at the end.\"\nTenSoon lay quietly. She could see guilt in his canine eyes. He\nshouldn't have helped me against his current master.\n\"Mistress,\" TenSoon said. \"You know our secret now. Mistborn can\ncontrol a kandra's body with Allomancy.

Perhaps he could persuade his former friend to see reason.\nIf he couldn't. . .well, a duplicate of the wooden coin Jastes had been\nusing to \"pay\" the koloss sat on Elend's desk. It was a perfect copy, whittled\nby Clubs himself. Elend was pretty certain that he had access to more wood\nthan Jastes did. If he could help Penrod stall for a few more weeks, they\nmight be able to make enough \"money\" to bribe the koloss away.\nHe set down his pen, rubbing his eyes. It was late. Time to—\nHis door slammed open. Elend spun, and caught sight of a flustered\nVin dashing across the room and into his arms. She was crying.\nAnd she was bloody.\n\"Vin!\" he said. \"What happened?\"\n\"I killed him,\" she said, head buried in Elend's chest.\n\"Who?\"\n\"Your brother,\" she said. \"Zane. Straff's Mistborn. I killed him.\"\n\"Wait. What? My brother?\"\nVin nodded. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Forget about that, Vin!\" Elend said, gently prying her back and\npushing her into his chair. She had a gash on her cheek, and her shirt was\nslick with blood. \"Lord Ruler! I'm going to get Sazed right now.\"\n\"Don't leave me,\" she said, holding his arm.\nElend paused. Something had changed. She seemed to need him again.\n\"Come with me, then. We'll both go see him.\"\nVin nodded, standing. She teetered just a bit, and Elend felt a spike of\nfear, but the determined look in her eyes wasn't something he wanted to\nchallenge.

You ruin more clothing\nin this manner, I think. . ..\"\n\"This isn't a time for levity, Sazed,\" Elend said.\n\"I apologize, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said, carefully cutting the clothing\naway from Vin's shoulder. \"However, if she is still conscious, then she isn't\nin serious danger.\" He peered closer at the wound, absently lifting clean\ncloths from his bag.\n\"You see?\" Sazed asked. \"This gash is deep, but the blade was\ndeflected by the bone, and missed hitting any major vessels. Hold this\nhere.\" He pressed a cloth to the wound, and Elend put his hand on it. Vin sat\nwith her eyes closed, resting back against the wall, blood dripping slowly\nfrom her chin. She seemed more exhausted than in pain.\nSazed took his knife and cut away the front of Vin's shirt, exposing her\nwounded chest.\nElend paused. \"Perhaps I should. . .\"\n\"Stay,\" Vin said. It wasn't a plea, but a command. She raised her head,\nopening her eyes as Sazed tisked quietly at the wound, then got out a\nnumbing agent and some needle and thread.\n\"Elend,\" she said, \"I need to tell you something.\"\nHe paused. \"All right.\"\n\"I've realized something about Kelsier,\" she said quietly. \"I always\nfocus on the wrong things, when it comes to him.

This\nisn't a decision to be made lightly, under the influence of strong emotions.\"\nVin smiled. \"The decision to get married shouldn't be made because of\nstrong emotions?\"\nSazed floundered. \"That isn't exactly what I meant.

He thought of\nhow much he depended on her wisdom, and her bluntness, and her simple\n—but not simplistic—devotion to him. Yes, he did love her.\nThe world had gone chaotic recently.

I have known you both for some time, and am willing to give my\nblessing to this union. I simply offer counsel. Those who take lightly\npromises they make to those they love are people who find little lasting\nsatisfaction in life. This is not an easy time in which to live.

However, from a larger view, they may be solutions to one\nanother.\"\nElend smiled. \"Like the lock and the key.\"\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said, smiling. \"Precisely like that.\"\n\"It thumps,\" Vin whispered, eyes closing. \"In my head. I can feel it.\"\nSazed paused, then wrapped a bandage around Vin's arm. \"Can you\nfeel where it is?\"\nVin shook her head. \"I. . .There doesn't seem to be a direction to the\npulses.

Maybe it's time I started\nlistening to the things she's been trying to tell me.\n\"Sazed,\" Elend said, a sudden thought occurring to him, \"do you think\nthat I could convince the Terris people to help us?\"\n\"Perhaps, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"My prohibition against\ninterfering—the one I have been ignoring—comes because I was given a\ndifferent assignment by the Synod, not because we believe in avoiding all\naction.

The things\nhe'd said about the Well were, of course, falsehoods. If there was such a\npower, he had no idea where it was, nor what it would do.\nHow history judged him would probably depend on what Elend and\nVin did with their lives. Sazed could only hope that he had done the right\nthing. Watching them go, knowing that their youthful love would be spared,\nhe couldn't help but smile at his decision.\nWith a sigh, he stooped down and gathered up his medical items; then\nhe retreated to his rooms to fabricate the map he had promised Vin and\nElend.\nPART FIVE\nSNOW AND ASH\nHe is accustomed to giving up his own will before the greater good, as\nhe sees it.\n49"

I see it all the time, watching me, following me. And I hear\nthose rhythms in my head—majestic, powerful thumpings, like Allomantic\npulses. Only, I don't need bronze anymore to hear them.\"\nElend squeezed her shoulder. \"I believe you, Vin.\"\nShe looked up, reserved. \"Do you, Elend? Do you really?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" he admitted. \"But I'm trying very hard to. Either way, I\nthink going north is the right thing to do.\"\nShe nodded slowly. \"That's enough, I think.\"\nHe smiled, turning back to the doorway. \"Where is Spook?\"\nVin shrugged beneath her cloak. \"I assume Tindwyl won't be coming\nwith us, then.\"\n\"Probably not,\" Elend said, smiling.\n\"How will we find our way to Terris?\"\n\"It won't be hard,\" Elend said. \"We'll just follow the imperial canal to\nTathingdwen.\" He paused, thinking of the map Sazed had given them. It led\nstraight into the Terris Mountains. They'd have to get supplies in\nTathingdwen, and the snows would be high, but. . .well, that was a problem\nfor another time.\nVin smiled, and Elend walked over to pick up the package Tindwyl\nhad left. It appeared to be a book of some sort. A few moments later, Spook\narrived. He wore his soldier's uniform, and had saddlebags slung over his\nshoulder. He nodded to Elend, handed Vin a large bag, then moved to his\nown horse.\nHe looks nervous, Elend thought as the boy slung his bags over his"

She wore a rich\nbrown and red riding skirt, and had her hair tied up beneath a scarf. Where'd\nshe get that outfit? Elend wondered. Two servants followed her, bearing\nbundles.\nAllrianne paused, tapping her lip with a thoughtful expression. \"I think\nI'm going to need a packhorse.\"\n\"What are you doing?\" Vin demanded.\n\"Going with you,\" Allrianne said. \"Breezy says I have to leave the city.\nHe's a very silly man, sometimes, but he can be quite stubborn. He spent the\nentire conversation Soothing me—as if I couldn't recognize his touch by\nnow!\"\nAllrianne waved to one of the servants, who ran to get a stablehand.\n\"We're going to be riding very hard,\" Elend said. \"I'm not sure if you'll\nbe able to keep up.\"\nAllrianne rolled her eyes. \"I rode all the way out here from the Western\nDominance! I think I can manage. Besides, Vin is hurt, so you probably\nwon't be going that fast.\"\n\"We don't want you along,\" Vin said. \"We don't trust you—and we\ndon't like you.\"\nElend closed his eyes. Dear, blunt Vin.\nAllrianne just twittered a laugh as the servant returned with two\nhorses, then began to load one. \"Silly Vin,\" she said. \"How can you say that\nafter all we've shared?\"\n\"Shared?\" Vin asked. \"Allrianne, we went shopping together one\ntime.\"\n\"And I felt we bonded quite well,\" Allrianne said. \"Why, we're\npractically sisters!\"\nVin gave the girl a flat stare.\n\"Yes,\" Allrianne said, \"and you're definitely the older, boring sister.\"\nShe smiled sweetly, then swung easily up into her saddle, suggesting\nconsiderable horsemanship. One of the servants led her packhorse over,\nthen tied the reins into place behind Allrianne's saddle.\n\"All right, Elend dear,\" she said. \"I'm ready. Let's go.\"\nElend glanced at Vin, who shook her head with a dark look.\n\"You can leave me behind if you wish,\" Allrianne said, \"but I'll just\nfollow and get into trouble, and then you'll have to come save me. And don't\neven try and pretend that you wouldn't!\"\nElend sighed. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"\nThey made their way slowly through the city, Elend and Vin at the\nlead, Spook bringing their packhorses, Allrianne riding to the side.

The king is abandoning us. . ..\nHe knew that many of them still couldn't understand that Lord Penrod\nheld the throne. Elend glanced away from an alleyway, where he saw many\neyes watching him. There was a haunted fear in those eyes. He had\nexpected to see accusations, but somehow their despondent acceptance was\neven more disheartening. They expected him to flee. They expected to be\nabandoned. He was one of the few rich enough, and powerful enough, to\nget away. Of course he'd run.\nHe squeezed his own eyes shut, trying to force down his guilt. He\nwished that they could have left at night, sneaking out the passwall as\nHam's family had. However, it was important that Straff saw Elend and Vin\nleaving, so that he understood he could take the city without attacking.\nI'll be back, Elend promised the people. I'll save you. For now, it's\nbetter if I leave.\nThe broad doors of Tin Gate appeared ahead of them. Elend kicked his\nhorse forward, speeding ahead of his silent wave of followers. The guards at\nthe gate already had their orders. Elend gave them a nod, reining in his\nhorse, and the men swung the doors open. Vin and the others joined him\nbefore the opening portal.\n\"Lady Heir,\" one of the guards asked quietly. \"Are you leaving, too?\"\nVin looked to the side. \"Peace,\" she said. \"We're not abandoning you.\nWe're going for help.\"\nThe soldier smiled.\nHow can he trust her so easily? Elend thought. Or, is hope all he has\nleft?\nVin turned her horse around, facing the crowd of people, and she\nlowered her hood. \"We will return,\" she promised. She didn't seem as\nnervous as she had before when dealing with people who revered her.\nEver since last night, something has changed in her, Elend thought.\nAs a group, the soldiers saluted them. Elend saluted back; then he\nnodded to Vin. He led the way as they galloped out the gates, angling\ntoward the northern highway—a path that would allow them to skirt just\nwest of Straff's army.\nThey hadn't gone far before a group of horsemen moved to intercept\nthem. Elend rode low on his horse, sparing a glance for Spook and the\npackhorses. What caught Elend's attention, however, was Allrianne: she\nrode with amazing proficiency, a look of determination on her face. She\ndidn't seem the least bit nervous.\nTo the side, Vin whipped her cloak back, bringing out a handful of\ncoins. She flung them into the air, and they shot forward with a speed Elend\nhad never seen, even from other Allomancers. Lord Ruler! he thought with\nshock as the coins zipped away, disappearing faster than he could track.\nSoldiers fell, and Elend barely heard the plinging of metal against\nmetal over the sound of wind and hoofbeats. He rode directly through the\ncenter of the chaotic group of men, many of them down and dying."

She had opened the bag of pewter, he noticed, and was releasing the\ndust in a shower behind her as she rode, Pushing some of it to the sides.\nThe next arrows won't have metal heads, Elend thought nervously.\nSoldiers were forming up behind, shouting.\n\"I'll catch up,\" Vin said, then jumped off her horse.\n\"Vin!\" Elend yelled, turning his beast. Allrianne and Spook shot past\nhim, riding hard. Vin landed and, amazingly, didn't even stumble as she\nbegan to run. She downed a vial of metal, then looked toward the archers.\nArrows flew. Elend cursed, but kicked his horse into motion. There\nwas little he could do now. He rode low, galloping as the arrows fell around\nhim. One passed within inches of his head, falling to stick into the road.\nAnd then they stopped falling. He glanced backward, teeth gritted. Vin\nstood before a rising cloud of dust. The pewter dust, he thought. She's\nPushing on it—Pushing the flakes along the ground, stirring up the dust and\nash.\nA massive wave of dust, metal, and ash slammed into the archers,\nwashing over them. It blew around the soldiers, making them curse and\nshield their eyes, and some fell to the ground, holding their faces.\nVin swung back onto her horse, then galloped away from the billowing\nmass of wind-borne particles. Elend slowed his horse, letting her catch up.\nThe army was in chaos behind them, men giving orders, people scattering.\n\"Speed up!\" Vin said as she approached. \"We're almost out of\nbowshot!\"\nSoon they joined Allrianne and Spook. We aren't out of danger—my\nfather could still decide to send pursuit.\nBut, the soldiers couldn't have mistaken Vin. If Elend's instincts were\nright, Straff would let them run. His prime target was Luthadel. He could go\nafter Elend later; for now, he would simply be happy to see Vin leaving.\n\"Thank you kindly for the help getting out,\" Allrianne suddenly said,\nwatching the army. \"I'll be going now.\"\nWith that, she veered her two horses away, angling toward a group of\nlow hills to the west.\n\"What?\" Elend asked with surprise, pulling up next to Spook.\n\"Leave her,\" Vin said. \"We don't have time.\"\nWell, that solves one problem, Elend thought, turning his horse to the\nnorthern highway. Farewell, Luthadel. I'll be back for you later.\n\"Well, that solves one problem,\" Breeze noted, standing atop the city\nwall and watching Elend's group disappear around a hillside. To the east, a\nlarge—and still unexplained—pillar of smoke rose from the koloss camp.\nTo the west, Straff's army was buzzing about, stirred by the escape.\nAt first, Breeze had worried about Allrianne's safety—but then he'd\nrealized that, enemy army notwithstanding, there was no safer place for her"

As long as Allrianne didn't get too far away from the\nothers, she would be safe.\nIt was a quiet group that stood atop the wall with him, and for once,\nBreeze barely touched their emotions. Their solemnity seemed appropriate.\nThe young Captain Demoux stood beside the aging Clubs, and the peaceful\nSazed stood with Ham the warrior. Together, they watched the seed of hope\nthey'd cast to the winds.\n\"Wait,\" Breeze said, frowning as he noticed something. \"Wasn't\nTindwyl supposed to be with them?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"She decided to Stay.\"\n\"Why would she do that?\" Breeze asked. \"Didn't I hear her babbling\nsomething about not interfering in local disputes?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"I do not know, Lord Breeze. She is a difficult\nwoman to read.\"\n\"They all are,\" Clubs muttered.\nSazed smiled. \"Either way, it appears our friends have escaped.\"\n\"May the Survivor protect them,\" Demoux said quietly.\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said. \"May he indeed.\"\nClubs snorted. Resting one arm on the battlements, he turned to eye\nSazed with a gnarled face. \"Don't encourage him.\"\nDemoux flushed, then turned and walked away.\n\"What was that about?\" Breeze asked curiously.\n\"The boy has been preaching to my soldiers,\" Clubs said. \"Told him I\ndidn't want his nonsense cluttering their minds.\"\n\"It is not nonsense, Lord Cladent,\" Sazed said, \"it's faith.\"\n\"Do you honestly think,\" Clubs said, \"that Kelsier is going to protect\nthese people?\"\nSazed wavered. \"They believe it, and that is—\"\n\"No,\" Clubs interrupted, scowling. \"That isn't enough, Terrisman.\nThese people fool themselves by believing in the Survivor.\"\n\"You believed in him,\" Sazed said. Breeze was tempted to Soothe him,\nmake the argument less tense, but Sazed already seemed completely calm.\n\"You followed him. You believed in the Survivor enough to overthrow the\nFinal Empire.\"\nClubs scowled. \"I don't like your ethics, Terrisman—I never have. Our\ncrew—Kelsier's crew—fought to free this people because it was right.\"\n\"Because you believed it to be right,\" Sazed said.\n\"And what do you believe to be right, Terrisman?\"\n\"That depends,\" Sazed said. \"There are many different systems with\nmany different worthy values.\"\nClubs nodded, then turned, as if the argument were over.\n\"Wait, Clubs,\" Ham said. \"Aren't you going to respond to that?\"\n\"He said enough,\" Clubs said. \"His belief is situational. To him, even\nthe Lord Ruler was a deity because people worshipped him—or were forced\nto worship him. Aren't I right, Terrisman?\"\n\"In a way, Lord Cladent,\" Sazed said. \"Though, the Lord Ruler might\nhave been something of an exception.\"\n\"But you still keep records and memories of the Steel Ministry's\npractices, don't you?\" Ham asked.\n\"Yes,\" Sazed admitted."

He'd had a hard evening, sending assassins after Zane, then\nsomehow escaping death at the insane Mistborn's hands. Yet, during the\nnight, Straff's shakes hadn't gotten better. They'd grown worse. They weren't\njust from nervousness; he must have a disease of some sort.\n\"Your Majesty!\" a voice called from outside.\nStraff straightened himself, trying to look as presentable as possible.\nEven so, the messenger paused as he entered the tent, apparently noting\nStraff's wan skin and tired eyes.\n\"My. . .lord,\" the messenger said.\n\"Speak, man,\" Straff said curtly, trying to project a regality he didn't\nfeel. \"Out with it.\"\n\"Riders, my lord,\" the man said. \"They left the city!\"\n\"What!\" Straff said, throwing off his blanket and standing.

Good. Someone was with him.\n\"Amaranta,\" he said again. \"Send for her.\"\n\"Your mistress, my lord?\"\nStraff forced himself to remain conscious. As he sat, his vision and\nbalance returned somewhat. One of his door guards was at his side. What\nwas the man's name? Grent.\n\"Grent,\" Straff said, trying to sound commanding. \"You must bring\nAmaranta to me. Now!\"\nThe soldier hesitated, then rushed from the room. Straff focused on his\nbreathing. In and out. In and out. Zane was a snake. In and out. In and out.\nZane hadn't wanted to use the knife—no, that was expected. In and out. But\nwhen had the poison come? Straff had been feeling ill the entire day before.\n\"My lord?\"\nAmaranta stood at the doorway. She had been beautiful once, before\nage had gotten to her—as it got to all of them. Childbirth destroyed a\nwoman. So succulent she had been, with her firm breasts and smooth,\nunblemished skin. . ..\nYour mind is wandering, Straff told himself. Focus.\n\"I need. . .antidote,\" Straff forced out, focusing on the Amaranta of the\nnow: the woman in her late twenties, the old—yet still useful—thing that\nkept him alive in the face of Zane's poisons.\n\"Of course, my lord,\" Amaranta said, walking over to his poison\ncabinet, getting out the necessary ingredients.\nStraff settled back, focusing on his breathing.

Yes, Allrianne understood this concept quite well\n—for there were few things more quickly dismissed than a young, silly girl.\n\"Halt!\" a soldier said, riding up with an honor guard. They had swords\ndrawn. \"Step away from her, you!\"\nOh, honestly, Allrianne thought, rolling her eyes. She Rioted the group\nof soldiers, enhancing their sense of calmness. She didn't want any\naccidents.\n\"Please, Captain,\" she said as Hobart and his crew drew weapons,\nhuddling around her uncertainly. \"These men have rescued me from the\nsavage wilderness and brought me safely home, at much personal cost and\ndanger.\"\nHobart nodded firmly, an action undermined just a bit as he wiped his\nnose on his sleeve. The soldier captain looked over the ash-stained, motley-\nclothed group of bandits, then frowned.\n\"See that these men have a good meal, Captain,\" she said airily,\nkicking her horse forward. \"And give them space for the night. Hobart, I'll\nsend your reward once I meet with my father.\"\nBandits and soldiers moved in behind her, and Allrianne made sure to\nRiot them both, enhancing their senses of trust. It was a tough sell for the\nsoldiers, especially as the wind shifted, blowing the full stench of the bandit\ncrew across them. Still, they all reached the camp without incident.\nThe groups parted, Allrianne giving her horses to an aide and calling\nfor a page to warn her father that she'd returned.

She dusted off her riding\ndress, then strode through camp, smiling pleasantly and looking forward to\na bath and the other comforts—such as they were—that the army could\nprovide. However, first there were things she needed to attend to.\nHer father liked to spend evenings in his open-sided planning pavilion,\nand he sat there now, arguing with a messenger. He looked over as\nAllrianne swished into the pavilion, smiling sweetly at Lords Galivan and\nDetor, her father's generals.\nCett sat on a high-legged chair so he could get a good view of his table\nand its maps. \"Well, damn it,\" he said. \"You are back.\"\nAllrianne smiled, wandering around his planning table, looking at the\nmap. It detailed the supply lines back to the Western Dominance. What she\nsaw was not good.\n\"Rebellions back home, Father?\" she asked.\n\"And ruffians attacking my supply carts,\" Cett said. \"That boy Venture\nbribed them, I'm sure of it.\"\n\"Yes, he did,\" Allrianne said. \"But, that's all pointless now. Did you\nmiss me?\" She made sure to Tug strongly on his sense of devotion.\nCett snorted, pulling at his beard. \"Fool of a girl,\" he said. \"I should\nhave left you home.\"\n\"So I could have fallen to your enemies when they raised a rebellion?\"\nshe asked. \"We both know that Lord Yomen was going to move the moment\nyou pulled your armies out of the dominance.\"\n\"And I should have let that damn obligator have you!\"\nAllrianne gasped. \"Father! Yomen would have held me for ransom.\nYou know how terribly I wilt when I'm locked up.\"\nCett glanced at her, and then—apparently despite himself—he started\nto chuckle. \"You'd've had him feeding you gourmet foods before the day\nwas through. Maybe I should have left you behind. Then, at least, I'd have\nknown where you were—rather than worrying where you'd run off to next.\nYou didn't bring that idiot Breeze back with you, did you?\"\n\"Father!\" Allrianne said. \"Breezy is a good man.\"\n\"Good men die quickly in this world, Allrianne,\" Cett said. \"I know—\nI've killed enough of them.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Allrianne said, \"you're very wise. And taking an aggressive\nstance against Luthadel had such a positive outcome, didn't it? Chased away\nwith your tail between your legs? You'd be dead now, if dear Vin had as\nlittle conscience as you.\"\n\"That 'conscience' didn't stop her from killing some three hundred of\nmy men,\" Cett said.\n\"She's a very confused young lady,\" Allrianne said. \"Either way, I do\nfeel obliged to remind you that I was right. You should have made an\nalliance with the Venture boy, instead of threatening him. That means you\nowe me five new dresses!\"\nCett rubbed his forehead. \"This isn't a damn game, girl.\""

Instead, he simply shook his head. \"Luthadel\nholds nothing for us, Allrianne.\"\n\"We can't go back to the dominance, either,\" Allrianne said. \"Our\nenemies are too strong, and some of them have Allomancers. That's why we\nhad to come here in the first place. We can't leave the area until we have\neither money or allies.\"\n\"There's no money in Luthadel,\" Cett said. \"I believe Venture when he\nsays the atium isn't there.\"\n\"I agree,\" Allrianne said. \"I searched that palace well, never found a bit\nof the stuff. That means we need to leave here with friends, instead of\nmoney. Go back, wait for a battle to start, then help whichever side looks\nlike it's going to win. They'll feel indebted to us—they might even decide to\nlet us live.\"\nCett stood quietly for a moment. \"That's not going to help save your\nfriend Breeze, Allrianne. His faction is by far the weakest—even teaming\nwith the Venture boy, I doubt we could beat Straff or those koloss. Not\nwithout access to the city walls and plenty of time to prepare. If we go back,\nit will be to help your Breeze's enemies.\"\nAllrianne shrugged. You can't help him if you're not there, Father, she\nthought. They're going to lose anyway—if you are in the area, then there's a\nchance you'll end up helping Luthadel.\nA very small chance, Breeze. That's the best I can give you.

He would have expected her to be a light sleeper, considering how\njumpy she was, but she seemed to feel comfortable sleeping beside him.\nShe even seemed to become just a little less anxious when he put his arms\naround her.\nHe looked down at her fondly, admiring the form of her face, the slight\ncurl of her black hair. The cut on her cheek was almost invisible now, and\nshe'd already pulled out the stitches. A constant, low burn of pewter gave\nthe body remarkable strength for recovery. She didn't even favor her right\narm anymore—despite the cut shoulder—and her weakness from the fight\nseemed completely gone.\nShe still hadn't given him much of an explanation regarding that night.\nShe had fought Zane—who had apparently been Elend's half brother—and\nTenSoon the kandra had left. Yet, neither of those things seemed like they\ncould have caused the distress in her he'd sensed when she'd come to him in\nhis rooms.\nHe didn't know if he'd ever get the answers he wanted. Yet, he was\ncoming to realize that he could love her even if he didn't completely\nunderstand her. He bent down and kissed the top of her head.\nShe immediately tensed, eyes opening. She sat up, exposing a bare\ntorso, then glanced around their small tent. It was dimly lit with the light of\ndawn. Finally, she shook her head, looking over at him. \"You're a bad\ninfluence on me.\"\n\"Oh?\" he asked, smiling as he rested on one arm.\nVin nodded, running a hand through her hair. \"You're making me get\nused to sleeping at night,\" she said. \"Plus, I don't sleep in my clothing\nanymore.\"\n\"If you did, it would make things a little awkward.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"but what if we get attacked during the night? I'd have\nto fight them naked.\"\n\"I wouldn't mind watching that.\"\nShe gave him a flat stare, then reached for a shirt.\n\"You're having a bad influence on me, too, you know,\" he said as he\nwatched her dress.\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\"You're making me relax,\" he said. \"And letting me stop worrying. I've\nbeen so tied up with things in the city lately that I'd forgotten what it was\nlike to be an impolite recluse. Unfortunately, during our trip, I've had time\nto read not only one, but all three volumes of Troubeld's Arts of\nScholarship.\"\nVin snorted, kneeling in the low tent as she pulled her belt tight; then\nshe crawled over to him. \"I don't know how you read while riding,\" she\nsaid.\n\"Oh, it's quite easy—if you aren't afraid of horses.\"\n\"I'm not afraid of them,\" Vin said. \"They just don't like me. They know\nI can outrun them, and that makes them surly.\"\n\"Oh, is that it?\" Elend asked, smiling, pulling her over to straddle him.\nShe nodded, then leaned down to kiss him. She ended it after a\nmoment, however, moving to stand. She swatted his hand away as he tried\nto pull her back down."

She swatted his hand away as he tried\nto pull her back down.\n\"After all the trouble I took to get dressed?\" she asked. \"Besides. I'm\nhungry.\"\nHe sighed, reclining back as she scampered out of the tent, into the red\nmorning sunlight. He lay for a moment, quietly remarking to himself on his\nfortune. He still wasn't sure how their relationship had worked out, or even\nwhy it made him so happy, but he was more than willing to enjoy the\nexperience.\nEventually, he looked over at his clothing. He had brought only one of\nhis nice uniforms—along with the riding uniform—and he didn't want to\nwear either too often. He didn't have servants anymore to wash the ash out\nof his clothing; in fact, despite the tent's double flap, some ash had managed\nto work its way inside during the night. Now that they were out of the city,\nthere were no workers to sweep the ash away, and it was getting\neverywhere.\nSo, he dressed in an outfit far more simple: a pair of riding trousers,\nnot unlike the pants that Vin often wore, with a buttoning gray shirt and a\ndark jacket. He'd never been forced to ride long distances before—carriages\nwere generally preferred—but Vin and he were taking the trip relatively\nslowly. They had no real urgency. Straff's scouts hadn't followed them for\nlong, and nobody was expecting them at their destination. They had time to\nride leisurely, taking breaks, occasionally walking so that they wouldn't get\ntoo sore from riding.\nOutside, he found Vin stirring up the morning fire and Spook caring\nfor the horses. The young man had done some extensive traveling, and he\nknew how to tend horses—something that Elend was embarrassed to have\nnever learned.\nElend joined Vin at the firepit. They sat for a few moments, Vin poking\nat the coals. She looked pensive.\n\"What?\" Elend asked.\nShe glanced southward. \"I. . .\" Then she shook her head. \"It's nothing.\nWe're going to need more wood.\" She glanced to the side, toward where\ntheir axe lay beside the tent. The weapon flipped up into the air, shooting\ntoward her blade-first. She stepped to the side, snatching the handle as it\npassed between her and Elend. Then she stalked over to a fallen tree. She\ntook two swings at it, then easily kicked it down and broke it in two.\n\"She has a way of making the rest of us feel a little redundant, doesn't\nshe?\" Spook asked, stepping up beside Elend.\n\"At times,\" Elend said with a smile.\nSpook shook his head. \"Whatever I see or hear, she can sense better—\nand she can fight whatever it is that she finds. Every time I come back to\nLuthadel, I just feel. . .useless.\"\n\"Imagine being a regular person,\" Elend said. \"At least you're an\nAllomancer.\"\n\"Maybe,\" Spook said, the sound of Vin chopping coming from the\nside. \"But people respect you, El. They just dismiss me.\"\n\"I don't dismiss you, Spook.\"\n\"Oh?\" the young man asked. \"When's the last time I did anything\nimportant for the crew?\""

You're not just here to tend horses, Spook—you're here because of your\nskills as a scout and a Tineye. Do you still think we're being followed?\"\nSpook paused, then shrugged. \"I can't be sure. I think Straff's scouts\nturned back, but I keep catching sight of someone back there. I never get a\ngood glimpse of them, though.\"\n\"It's the mist spirit,\" Vin said, walking by and dumping an armload of\nwood beside the firepit. \"It's chasing us.\"\nSpook and Elend shared a look. Then Elend nodded, refusing to act on\nSpook's uncomfortable stare. \"Well, as long as it stays out of our way, it's\nnot a problem, right?\"\nVin shrugged. \"I hope not. If you see it, though, call for me. The\nrecords say it can be dangerous.\"\n\"All right,\" Elend said. \"We'll do that. Now, let's decide what to have\nfor breakfast.\"\nStraff woke up. That was his first surprise.\nHe lay in bed, inside his tent, feeling like someone had picked him up\nand slammed him against the wall a few times. He groaned, sitting up. His\nbody was free from bruises, but he ached, and his head was pounding. One\nof the army healers, a young man with a full beard and bulging eyes, sat\nbeside his bed. The man studied Straff for a moment.\n\"You, my lord, should be dead,\" the young man said.\n\"I'm not,\" Straff said, sitting up. \"Give me some tin.\"\nA soldier approached with a metal vial. Straff downed it, then scowled\nat how dry and sore his throat was. He burned the tin only lightly; it made\nhis wounds feel worse, but he had come to depend on the slight edge the\nenhanced senses gave him.\n\"How long?\" he asked.\n\"Better part of three days, my lord,\" the healer said. \"We. . .weren't\nsure what you'd eaten, or why. We thought about trying to get you to vomit,\nbut it appeared that you'd taken the draught of your own choice, so. . .\"\n\"You did well,\" Straff said, holding his arm up in front of him. It still\nshook a bit, and he couldn't make it stop. \"Who is in charge of the army?\"\n\"General Janarle,\" the healer said.\nStraff nodded. \"Why hasn't he had me killed?\"\nThe healer blinked in surprise, glancing at the soldiers.\n\"My lord,\" said Grent the soldier, \"who would dare betray you? Any\nman who tried would end up dead in his tent. General Janarle was most\nworried about your safety.\"\nOf course, Straff realized with shock. They don't know that Zane is\ngone.

That didn't, of\ncourse, mean that Zane wouldn't return—but, then again, he might not.\nPerhaps. . .just maybe. . .Straff was rid of him forever.\n\"Elend's Mistborn,\" Straff said suddenly.\n\"We followed her for a while, my lord,\" Grent said. \"But, they got too\nfar from the army, and Lord Janarle ordered the scouts back.

The city is weak, and their Mistborn is\ngone.\"\n\"We're pulling back,\" Straff said, smiling. \"For a while, at least.\" Let's\nsee if this plan of yours works, Zane.\nSazed sat in a small kitchen alcove, hands on the table before him, a\nmetallic ring glittering on each finger. They were small, for metalminds, but\nstoring up Feruchemical attributes took time. It would take weeks to fill\neven a ring's worth of metal—and he barely had days. In fact, Sazed was\nsurprised the koloss had waited so long.\nThree days. Not much time at all, but he suspected he would need\nevery available edge in the approaching conflict. So far he'd been able to\nstore up a small amount of each attribute. Enough for a boost in an\nemergency, once his other metalminds ran out.\nClubs hobbled into the kitchen. He seemed a blur to Sazed. Even\nwearing his spectacles—to help compensate for the vision he was storing in\na tinmind—it was difficult for him to see.\n\"That's it,\" Clubs said, his voice muffled—another tinmind was taking\nSazed's hearing. \"They're finally gone.\"\nSazed paused for a moment, trying to decipher the comment. His\nthoughts moved as if through a thick, turgid soup, and it took him a moment\nto understand what Clubs had said.\nThey're gone. Straff's troops. They've withdrawn. He coughed quietly\nbefore replying. \"Did he ever respond to any of Lord Penrod's messages?\"\n\"No,\" Clubs said. \"But he did execute the last messenger.\"\nWell, that isn't a very good sign, Sazed thought slowly.

Of course,\nthere hadn't been very many good signs over the last few days. The city was\non the edge of starvation, and their brief respite of warmth was over. It\nwould snow this evening, if Sazed guessed right. That made him feel even\nmore guilty to be sitting in the kitchen nook, beside a warm hearth, sipping\nbroth as his metalminds sapped his strength, health, senses, and power of\nthought. He had rarely tried to fill so many at once.\n\"You don't look so good,\" Clubs noted, sitting.\nSazed blinked, thinking through the comment. \"My. . .goldmind,\" he\nsaid slowly. \"It draws my health, storing it up.\" He glanced at his bowl of\nbroth. \"I must eat to maintain my strength,\" he said, mentally preparing\nhimself to take a sip.\nIt was an odd process. His thoughts moved so slowly that it took him a\nmoment to decide to eat. Then his body reacted slowly, the arm taking a few\nseconds to move. Even then, the muscles quivered, their strength sapped\naway and stored in his pewtermind. Finally, he was able to get a spoonful to\nhis lips and take a quiet sip. It tasted bland; he was filling scent as well, and\nwithout it, his sense of taste was severely hampered.\nHe should probably be lying down—but if he did that, he was liable to\nsleep. And, while sleeping, he couldn't fill metalminds—or, at least, he\ncould fill only one. A bronzemind, the metal that stored wakefulness, would\nforce him to sleep longer in exchange for letting him go longer without\nsleep on another occasion.\nSazed sighed, carefully setting down his spoon, then coughing. He'd\ndone his best to help avert the conflict. His best plan had been to send a\nletter to Lord Penrod, urging him to inform Straff Venture that Vin was gone\nfrom the city. He had hoped that Straff would then be willing to make a\ndeal. Apparently, that tactic had been unsuccessful. Nobody had heard from\nStraff in days.\nTheir doom approached like the inevitable sunrise. Penrod had allowed\nthree separate groups of townspeople—one of them composed of nobility—\nto try to flee Luthadel. Straff's soldiers, more wary after Elend's escape, had\ncaught and slaughtered each group. Penrod had even sent a messenger to\nLord Jastes Lekal, hoping to strike some deal with the Southern leader, but\nthe messenger had not returned from the koloss camp.\n\"Well,\" Clubs said, \"at least we kept them off for a few days.\"\nSazed thought for a moment. \"It was simply a delay of the inevitable, I\nfear.\"\n\"Of course it was,\" Clubs said. \"But it was an important delay. Elend\nand Vin will be almost four days away by now. If the fighting had started\ntoo soon, you can bet that little Miss Mistborn would have come back and\ngotten herself killed trying to save us.\"\n\"Ah,\" Sazed said slowly, forcing himself to reach for another spoonful\nof broth.

None of those gates was built to\nwithstand an attack. And, as it stands, I can barely post a couple thousand\nguards at each gate, since I really don't know which way the koloss will\ncome first.\"\n\"Oh,\" Sazed said quietly.\n\"What did you expect, Terrisman?\" Clubs asked. \"Good news? The\nkoloss are bigger, stronger, and far crazier than we are. And they have an\nadvantage in numbers.\"\nSazed closed his eyes, quivering spoon held halfway to his lips. He\nsuddenly felt a weakness unrelated to his metalminds. Why didn't she go\nwith them? Why didn't she escape?\nAs Sazed opened his eyes, he saw Clubs waving for a servant to bring\nhim something to eat. The young girl returned with a bowl of soup. Clubs\neyed it with dissatisfaction for a moment, but then lifted a knotted hand and\nbegan to slurp. He shot a glance at Sazed. \"You expecting an apology out of\nme, Terrisman?\" he asked between spoonfuls.\nSazed sat shocked for a moment. \"Not at all, Lord Cladent,\" he finally\nsaid.\n\"Good,\" Clubs said. \"You're a decent enough person. You're just\nconfused.\"\nSazed sipped his soup, smiling. \"That is comforting to hear. I think.\"\nHe thought for a moment. \"Lord Cladent. I have a religion for you.\"\nClubs frowned. \"You don't give up, do you?\"\nSazed looked down. It took him a moment to gather together what he'd\nbeen thinking about before. \"What you said earlier, Lord Cladent. About\nsituational morality. It made me think of a faith, known as Dadradah. Its\npractitioners spanned many countries and peoples; they believed that there\nwas only one God, and that there was only one right way to worship.\"\nClubs snorted. \"I'm really not interested in one of your dead religions,\nTerrisman. I think that—\"\n\"They were artists,\" Sazed said quietly.\nClubs hesitated.\n\"They thought art drew one closer to God,\" Sazed said. \"They were\nmost interested in color and hue, and they were fond of writing poetry\ndescribing the colors they saw in the world around them.\"\nClubs was silent. \"Why preach this religion to me?\" he demanded.\n\"Why not pick one that is blunt, like I am?

He blinked, recalling memories\nwith effort through his muddled mind. \"That is not you. It is what you must\ndo, but it is not you. The others forget, I think, that you were a woodworker.\nAn artist. When we lived in your shop, I often saw you, putting the finishing\ntouches on pieces your apprentices had carved. I saw the care you used.\nThat shop was no simple front for you. You miss it, I know.\"\nClubs didn't respond.\n\"You must live as a soldier,\" Sazed said, pulling something from his\nsash with a weak hand. \"But you can still dream like an artist. Here. I had\nthis made for you. It is a symbol of the Dadradah faith. To its people, being\nan artist was a higher calling, even, than being a priest.\"\nHe set the wooden disk on the table. Then, with effort, he smiled at\nClubs. It had been a long time since he had preached a religion, and he\nwasn't certain what had made him decide to offer this one to Clubs. Perhaps\nit was to prove to himself that there was value in them. Perhaps it was\nstubbornness, reacting against the things Clubs had said earlier. Either way,\nhe found satisfaction in the way that Clubs stared at the simple wooden disk\nwith the carved picture of a brush on it.\nThe last time I preached a religion, he thought, I was in that village to\nthe south, the one where Marsh found me.\nWhatever happened to him, anyway? Why didn't he return to the city?\n\"Your woman has been looking for you,\" Clubs finally said, looking\nup, leaving the disk on the table.\n\"My woman?\" Sazed said. \"Why, we are not. . .\" He trailed off as\nClubs eyed him. The surly general was quite proficient at meaningful looks.\n\"Very well,\" Sazed said, sighing. He glanced down at his fingers and\nthe ten glittering rings they bore. Four were tin: sight, hearing, scent, and\ntouch. He continued to fill these; they wouldn't handicap him much. He\nreleased his pewtermind, however, as well as his steelmind and his\nzincmind.\nImmediately, strength refilled his body. His muscles stopped sagging,\nreverting from emaciated to healthy. The fuzz lifted from his mind,\nallowing him to think clearly, and the thick, swollen slowness evaporated.\nHe stood, invigorated.\n\"That's fascinating,\" Clubs mumbled.\nSazed looked down.\n\"I could see the change,\" Clubs said. \"Your body grew stronger, and\nyour eyes focused. Your arms stopped shaking. I guess you don't want to\nface that woman without all of your faculties, eh? I don't blame you.\" Clubs\ngrunted to himself, then continued to eat.\nSazed bid farewell to the man, then strode out of the kitchen. His feet\nand hands still seemed like nearly unfeeling lumps.

Why had Tindwyl\nstayed? And, if she was determined not to go back to Terris, why had she\navoided him these last few days? Was she mad that he had sent Elend\naway? Was she disappointed that he insisted on staying to help?\nHe found her inside Keep Venture's grand ballroom. He paused for a\nmoment, impressed—as always—by the room's unquestionable majesty. He\nreleased his sight tinmind for just a moment, removing his spectacles as he\nlooked around the awesome space.\nEnormous, rectangular stained-glass windows reached to the ceiling\nalong both walls of the huge room. Standing at the side, Sazed was dwarfed\nby massive pillars that supported a small gallery that ran beneath the\nwindows on either side of the chamber. Every bit of stone in the room\nseemed carved—every tile a part of one mosaic or another, every bit of\nglass colored to sparkle in the early-evening sunlight.\nIt's been so long. . .he thought. The first time he'd seen this chamber,\nhe had been escorting Vin to her first ball. It was then, while playing the\npart of Valette Renoux, she had met Elend. Sazed had chastised her for\ncarelessly attracting the attention of so powerful a man.\nAnd now he himself had performed their marriage. He smiled,\nreplacing his spectacles and filling his eyesight tinmind again. May the\nForgotten Gods watch over you, children. Make something of our sacrifice,\nif you can.\nTindwyl stood speaking with Dockson and a small group of\nfunctionaries at the center of the room. They were crowded around a large\ntable, and as Sazed approached, he could see what was spread atop it.\nMarsh's map, he thought. It was an extensive and detailed\nrepresentation of Luthadel, complete with notations about Ministry activity.\nSazed had a visual image of the map, as well as a detailed description of it,\nin one of his copperminds—and he had sent a physical copy to the Synod.\nTindwyl and the others had covered the large map with their own\nnotations. Sazed approached slowly, and as soon as Tindwyl saw him, she\nwaved for him to approach.\n\"Ah, Sazed,\" Dockson said in a businesslike tone, voice muddled to\nSazed's weak ears. \"Good. Please, come here.\"\nSazed stepped up onto the low dance floor, joining them at the table.\n\"Troop placements?\" he asked.\n\"Penrod has taken command of our armies,\" Dockson said. \"And he's\nput noblemen in charge of all twenty battalions. We're not certain we like\nthat situation.\"\nSazed looked over the men at the table. They were a group of scribes\nthat Dockson himself had trained—all skaa. Gods! Sazed thought. He can't\nbe planning a rebellion now of all times, can he?\n\"Don't look so frightened, Sazed,\" Dockson said. \"We're not going to\ndo anything too drastic—Penrod is still letting Clubs organize the city\ndefenses, and he seems to be taking advice from his military commanders."

They don't know anything about warfare—\nor even about survival. They've spent their lives ordering drinks and\nthrowing parties.\"\nWhy do you hate them so? Sazed thought. Ironically, Dockson was the\none in the crew who looked most like a nobleman. He was more natural in a\nsuit than Breeze, more articulate than Clubs or Spook. Only his insistence\non wearing a very unaristocratic half beard made him stand out.\n\"The nobility may not know warfare,\" Sazed said, \"but they are\nexperienced with command, I think.\"\n\"True,\" Dockson said. \"But so are we. That's why I want one of our\npeople near each gate, just in case things go poorly and someone really\ncompetent needs to take command.\"\nDockson pointed at the table, toward one of the gates—Steel Gate. It\nbore a notation of a thousand men in a defensive formation. \"This is your\nbattalion, Sazed. Steel Gate is the farthest the koloss are likely to reach, and\nso you might not even see any fighting. However, when the battle begins, I\nwant you there with a group of messengers to bring word back to Keep\nVenture in case your gate gets attacked. We'll set up a command post here in\nthe main ballroom—it's easily accessible with those broad doors, and can\naccommodate a lot of motion.\"\nAnd it was a not-so-subtle smack in the face of Elend Venture, and\nnobility in general, to use such a beautiful chamber as a setting from which\nto run a war. No wonder he supported me in sending Elend and Vin away.\nWith them gone, he's gained undisputed control of Kelsier's crew.\nIt wasn't a bad thing. Dockson was an organizational genius and a\nmaster of quick planning. He did have certain prejudices, however.\n\"I know you don't like to fight, Saze,\" Dockson said, leaning down on\nthe table with both hands. \"But we need you.\"\n\"I think he is preparing for battle, Lord Dockson,\" Tindwyl said,\neyeing Sazed. \"Those rings on his fingers give good indication of his\nintentions.\"\nSazed glanced across the table at her. \"And what is your place in this,\nTindwyl?\"\n\"Lord Dockson came to me for advice,\" Tindwyl said. \"He has little\nexperience with warfare himself, and wished to know the things I have\nstudied about the generals of the past.\"\n\"Ah,\" Sazed said. He turned to Dockson, frowning in thought.\nEventually, he nodded. \"Very well. I will take part in your project—but, I\nmust warn you against divisiveness. Please, tell your men not to break the\nchain of command unless they absolutely must.\"\nDockson nodded.\n\"Now, Lady Tindwyl,\" Sazed said. \"Might we speak for a moment in\nprivate?\"\nShe nodded, and they excused themselves, walking under the nearest"

In the shadows, behind one of the pillars, Sazed turned\ntoward Tindwyl. She looked so pristine—so poised, so calm—despite the\ndire situation. How did she do that?\n\"You're storing quite a large number of attributes, Sazed,\" Tindwyl\nnoted, glancing at his fingers again. \"Surely you have other metalminds\nprepared from before?\"\n\"I used all of my wakefulness and speed making my way to Luthadel,\"\nSazed said. \"And I have no health stored at all—I used up the last of it\novercoming a sickness when I was teaching in the South. I always intended\nto fill another one, but we've been too busy. I do have some large amount of\nstrength and weight stored, as well as a good selection of tinminds. Still,\none can never be too well prepared, I think.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Tindwyl said. She glanced back at the group around the\ntable. \"If it gives us something to do other than think about the inevitable,\nthen preparation has not been wasted, I think.\"\nSazed felt a chill. \"Tindwyl,\" he said quietly. \"Why did you stay?\nThere is no place for you here.\"\n\"There is no place for you either, Sazed.\"\n\"These are my friends,\" he said. \"I will not leave them.\"\n\"Then why did you convince their leaders to leave?\"\n\"To flee and live,\" Sazed said.\n\"Survival is not a luxury often afforded to leaders,\" Tindwyl said.\n\"When they accept the devotion of others, they must accept the\nresponsibility that comes with it. This people will die—but they need not\ndie feeling betrayed.\"\n\"They were not—\"\n\"They expect to be saved, Sazed,\" Tindwyl hissed quietly. \"Even those\nmen over there—even Dockson, the most practical one in this bunch—think\nthat they'll survive. And do you know why? Because, deep down, they\nbelieve that something will save them. Something that saved them before,\nthe only piece of the Survivor they have left. She represents hope to them\nnow. And you sent her away.\"\n\"To live, Tindwyl,\" Sazed repeated. \"It would have been a waste to\nlose Vin and Elend here.\"\n\"Hope is never wasted,\" Tindwyl said, eyes flashing. \"I thought you of\nall people would understand that. You think it was stubbornness that kept\nme alive all those years in the hands of the Breeders?\"\n\"And is it stubbornness or hope that kept you here, in the city?\" he\nasked.\nShe looked up at him. \"Neither.\"\nSazed looked at her for a long moment in the shadowed alcove.\nPlanners talked in the ballroom, their voices echoing. Shards of light from\nthe windows reflected off the marble floors, throwing slivers of illumination\nacross the walls. Slowly, awkwardly, Sazed put his arms around Tindwyl.\nShe sighed, letting him hold her.\nHe released his tinminds and let his senses return in a flood.\nSoftness from her skin and warmth from her body washed across him"

With a clumsy hand, Sazed pulled free\nhis spectacles so he could see her clearly. As sounds returned fully to his\nears, he could hear Tindwyl breathing beside him.\n\"Do you know why I love you, Sazed?\" she asked quietly.\n\"I cannot fathom,\" he answered honestly.\n\"Because you never give in,\" she said. \"Other men are strong like\nbricks—firm, unyielding, but if you pound on them long enough, they\ncrack. You. . .you're strong like the wind. Always there, so willing to bend,\nbut never apologetic for the times when you must be firm.

And. .\n.it feels right for her to do so. \"I fear that whatever I have won't be enough\nto save them,\" Sazed whispered.\n\"It was enough to save three of them, though,\" Tindwyl said. \"You\nwere wrong to send them away. . .but maybe you were right, too.\"\nSazed just closed his eyes and held her, cursing her for staying, yet\nloving her for it all the same.\nAt that moment, the wall-top warning drums began to beat.\nAnd so, I have made one final gamble.\n51\nTHE MISTY RED LIGHT OF morning was a thing that should not\nhave existed. Mist died before daylight. Heat made it evaporate; even\nlocking it inside of a closed room made it condense and disappear. It\nshouldn't have been able to withstand the light of the rising sun.\nYet it did. The farther they'd gotten from Luthadel, the longer the mists\nlingered in the mornings. The change was slight—they were still only a few\ndays' ride from Luthadel—but Vin knew. She saw the difference. This\nmorning, the mists seemed even stronger than she'd anticipated—they didn't\neven weaken as the sun came up. They obscured its light.\nMist, she thought. Deepness. She was increasingly sure that she was\nright about it, though she couldn't know for certain. Still, it felt right to her\nfor some reason. The Deepness hadn't been some monster or tyrant, but a\nforce more natural—and therefore more frightening. A creature could be\nkilled. The mists. . .they were far more daunting. The Deepness wouldn't\noppress with priests, but use the people's own superstitious terror. It\nwouldn't slaughter with armies, but with starvation.\nHow did one fight something larger than a continent? A thing that\ncouldn't feel anger, pain, hope, or mercy?\nYet, it was Vin's task to do just that. She sat quietly on a large boulder\nbeside the night's firepit, her legs up, knees to her chest. Elend still slept;\nSpook was out scouting."

She was either mad or she\nwas the Hero of Ages. It was her task to defeat the mists. Yet. . .she thought,\nfrowning. Shouldn't the thumpings be getting louder, not softer? The longer\nthey traveled, the weaker the thumpings seemed. Was she too late? Was\nsomething happening at the Well to dampen its power? Had someone else\nalready taken it?\nWe have to keep moving.\nAnother person in her place might have asked why he had been\nchosen. Vin had known several men—both in Camon's crew and in Elend's\ngovernment—who would complain every time they were given an\nassignment. \"Why me?\" they would ask. The insecure ones didn't think they\nwere up to the task. The lazy ones wanted out of the work.\nVin didn't consider herself to be either self-assured or self-motivated.\nStill, she saw no point in asking why. Life had taught her that sometimes\nthings simply happened. Often, there hadn't been any specific reason for\nReen to beat her. And, reasons were weak comforts, anyway. The reasons\nthat Kelsier had needed to die were clear to her, but that didn't make her\nmiss him any less.\nShe had a job to do. The fact that she didn't understand it didn't stop\nher from acknowledging that she had to try to accomplish it. She simply\nhoped that she'd know what to do when the time came. Though the\nthumpings were weaker, they were still there. They drew her forward. To\nthe Well of Ascension.\nBehind her, she could feel the lesser vibration of the mist spirit. It\nnever disappeared until the mists themselves did. It had been there all\nmorning, standing just behind her.\n\"Do you know the secret to this all?\" she asked quietly, turning toward\nthe spirit in the reddish mists. \"Do you have—\"\nThe Allomantic pulse of the mist spirit was coming from directly\ninside the tent she shared with Elend.\nVin jumped off the rock, landing on the frosted ground and scrambling\nto the tent. She threw open the flaps. Elend slept inside, head just barely\nvisible as it poked out of the blankets. Mist filled the small tent, swirling,\ntwisting—and that was odd enough. Mist didn't usually enter tents.\nAnd there, in the middle of the mists, was the spirit. Standing directly\nabove Elend.\nIt wasn't even really there. It was just an outline in the mists, a\nrepeating pattern caused by chaotic movements. And yet it was real. She\ncould feel it, and she could see it—see it as it looked up, meeting her gaze\nwith invisible eyes.\nHateful eyes.\nIt raised an insubstantial arm, and Vin saw something flash. She\nreacted immediately, whipping out a dagger, bursting into the tent and\nswinging. Her blow met something tangible in the mist spirit's hand. A\nmetallic sound rang in the calm air, and Vin felt a powerful, numbing chill\nin her arm. The hairs across her entire body prickled.\nAnd then it disappeared. Fading away, like the ringing of its somehow\nsubstantial blade. Vin blinked, then turned to look through the blowing tent"

The daylight meant\nsafety, for now. Once, it was the nights that I found safe, she thought.\nKelsier gave them to me.\n\"What's wrong?\" Elend asked. How could someone, even a nobleman,\nbe so slow to rise, so unconcerned about the vulnerability he displayed\nwhile sleeping?\nShe sheathed her dagger. What can I tell him? How can I protect him\nfrom something I can barely see? She needed to think. \"It was nothing,\" she\nsaid quietly. \"Just me. . .being jumpy again.\"\nElend rolled over, sighing contentedly. \"Is Spook doing his morning\nscout?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Wake me when he gets back.\"\nVin nodded, but he probably couldn't see her. She knelt, looking at him\nas the sun rose behind her. She'd given herself to him—not just her body,\nand not just her heart. She'd abandoned her rationalizations, given away her\nreservations, all for him. She could no longer afford to think that she wasn't\nworthy of him, no longer give herself the false comfort of believing they\ncouldn't ever be together.\nShe'd never trusted anyone this much. Not Kelsier, not Sazed, not\nReen. Elend had everything. That knowledge made her tremble inside. If\nshe lost him, she would lose herself.\nI mustn't think about that! she told herself, rising. She left the tent,\nquietly closing the flaps behind her. In the distance, shadows moved. Spook\nappeared a moment later.\n\"Someone's definitely back there,\" he said quietly. \"Not spirits, Vin.\nFive men, with a camp.\"\nVin frowned. \"Following us?\"\n\"They must be.\"\nStraff's scouts, she thought. \"We'll let Elend decide what to do about\nthem.\"\nSpook shrugged, walking over to sit on her rock. \"You going to wake\nhim?\"\nVin turned back. \"Let him sleep a little longer.\"\nSpook shrugged again. He watched as she walked over to the firepit\nand unwrapped the wood they'd covered the night before, then began to\nbuild a fire.\n\"You've changed, Vin,\" Spook said.\nShe continued to work. \"Everyone changes,\" she said. \"I'm not a thief\nanymore, and I have friends to support me.\"\n\"I don't mean that,\" Spook said. \"I mean recently. This last week.\nYou're different than you were.\"\n\"Different how?\"\n\"I don't know. You don't seem as frightened all the time.\"\nVin paused. \"I've made some decisions. About who I am, and who I\nwill be.

Sixteen and hardly grown into his body,\nhe was the same age that she'd been when Kelsier had recruited her. He was\nsquinting against the light, even though the sun was low.\n\"Lower your tin,\" Vin said. \"No need to keep it on so strong.\"\nSpook shrugged. She could see the uncertainty in him. He wanted so\nbadly to be useful. She knew that feeling.\n\"What about you, Spook?\" she said, turning to gather the breakfast\nsupplies. Broth and mealcakes again. \"How have you been lately?\"\nHe shrugged yet again.\nI'd almost forgotten what it was like to try and have a conversation\nwith a teenage boy, she thought, smiling.\n\"Spook. . .\" she said, just testing out the name. \"What do you think of\nthat nickname, anyway? I remember when everyone called you by your real\nname.\" Lestibournes—Vin had tried to spell it once. She'd gotten about five\nletters in.\n\"Kelsier gave me my name,\" Spook said, as if that were reason enough\nto keep it. And perhaps it was. Vin saw the look in Spook's eyes when he\nmentioned Kelsier; Clubs might be Spook's uncle, but Kelsier had been the\none he looked up to.\nOf course, they all had looked up to Kelsier.\n\"I wish I were powerful, Vin,\" Spook said quietly, arms folded on his\nknees as he sat on the rock. \"Like you.\"\n\"You have your own skills.\"\n\"Tin?\" Spook asked. \"Almost worthless. If I were Mistborn, I could do\ngreat things. Be someone important.\"\n\"Being important isn't all that wonderful, Spook,\" Vin said, listening to\nthe thumpings in her head. \"Most of the time, it's just annoying.\"\nSpook shook his head. \"If I were Mistborn, I could save people—help\npeople, who need it. I could stop people from dying. But. . .I'm just Spook.\nWeak. A coward.\"\nVin looked at him, frowning, but his head was bowed, and he wouldn't\nmeet her eyes.\nWhat was that about? she wondered.\nSazed used a bit of strength to help him take the steps three at a time.\nHe burst out of the stairwell just behind Tindwyl, the two of them joining\nthe remaining members of the crew on the wall top. The drums still\nsounded; each had a different rhythm as it sounded over the city. The\nmixing beats echoed chaotically from buildings and alleyways.\nThe northern horizon seemed bare without Straff's army.

Men began to dash in all directions. Soldiers\nscrambled up the stairwells, clogging the way down, keeping the crew from\nmoving.\nIt's happening, Sazed thought numbly.\n\"Once the stairwells are open,\" Dockson said quietly, \"I want each of\nyou to go to your battalion. Tindwyl, you have Tin Gate, in the north by\nKeep Venture. I might need your advice, but for now, stay with those boys.\nThey'll listen to you—they respect Terrismen. Breeze, you have one of your\nSoothers in each of battalions four through twelve?\"\nBreeze nodded. \"They aren't much, though. . ..\"\n\"Just have them keep those boys fighting!\" Dockson said. \"Don't let\nour men break!\"\n\"A thousand men are far too many for one Soother to handle, my\nfriend,\" Breeze said.\n\"Have them do the best they can,\" Dockson said. \"You and Ham take\nPewter Gate and Zinc Gate—looks like the koloss are going to hit here first.\nClubs should bring in reinforcements.\"\nThe two men nodded; then Dockson looked at Sazed. \"You know\nwhere to go?\"\n\"Yes. . .yes, I think so,\" Sazed said, gripping the wall. In the air, flakes\nof ash began to fall from the sky.\n\"Go, then!\" Dockson said as one final squad of archers made its way\nout of the stairwell.\n\"My lord Venture!\"\nStraff turned. With some stimulants, he was able to remain strong\nenough to stay atop his saddle—though he wouldn't have dared to fight. Of\ncourse, he wouldn't have fought anyway. That wasn't his way.

He\nwasn't officially in charge of the men, so he didn't have any orders to give.\nHe simply stood with the scouts and messengers, waiting to see if he was\nneeded or not.\nThat left him plenty of time to watch the horror unfolding. The koloss\nweren't charging his section of the wall yet, thankfully, and his men stood\nwatching tensely as the creatures barreled toward Tin Gate and Pewter Gate\nin the distance.\nEven far away—the tower letting him see over a section of the city to\nwhere Tin Gate lay—Sazed could see the koloss running straight through\nhailstorms of arrows. Some of the smaller ones appeared to fall dead or\nwounded, but most just continued to charge. Men murmured on the tower\nnear him.\nWe aren't ready for this, Sazed thought. Even with months to plan and\nanticipate, we aren't ready.\nThis is what we get, being ruled over by a god for a thousand years. A\nthousand years of peace—tyrannical peace, but peace nonetheless. We don't\nhave generals, we have men who know how to order a bath drawn. We don't\nhave tacticians, we have bureaucrats. We don't have warriors, we have boys\nwith sticks.\nEven as he watched the oncoming doom, his scholar's mind was\nanalytical. Tapping sight, he could see that many of the distant creatures—\nespecially the larger ones—carried small uprooted trees. They were ready,\nin their own way, to break into the city. The trees wouldn't be as effective as\nreal battering rams—but then, the city gates weren't built to withstand a real\nbattering in the first place.\nThose koloss are smarter than we give them credit for, he thought.\nThey can recognize the abstract value of coins, even if they don't have an\neconomy.

Sazed's own section had similar piles, one just next to the\ngate arch, beside which he stood. But arrows had almost no effect; what\ngood would a few rocks do? Koloss clumped around the base of the wall,\nlike the water of a dammed-up river. Distant thumps sounded as the\ncreatures began to beat against the gates.\n\"Battalion sixteen!\" a messenger called from below, riding up to\nSazed's gate. \"Lord Culee!\"\n\"Here!\" a man called from the wall top beside Sazed's tower.\n\"Pewter Gate needs reinforcements immediately! Lord Penrod\ncommands you to bring six companies and follow me!\"\nLord Culee began to give the orders. Six companies. . .Sazed thought.\nSix hundred of our thousand. Clubs's words from earlier returned to him:\nTwenty thousand men might seem like a lot, until one saw how thinly they\nhad to be stretched.\nThe six companies marched away, leaving the courtyard before Sazed's\ngate disturbingly empty. The four hundred remaining men—three hundred\nin the courtyard, one hundred on the wall—shuffled quietly.\nSazed closed his eyes and tapped his hearing tinmind. He could hear. .\n.wood beating on wood. Screams. Human screams. He released the tinmind\nquickly, then tapped eyesight again, leaning out and looking toward the\nsection of the wall where the battle was being fought. The koloss were\nthrowing back the fallen rocks—and they were far more accurate than the\ndefenders. Sazed jumped as he saw a young soldier's face crushed, his body\nthrown back off the wall top by the rock's force. Sazed released his tinmind,\nbreathing quickly.\n\"Be firm, men!\" called one of the soldiers on the wall. He was barely a\nyouth—a nobleman, but he couldn't be more than sixteen. Of course, a lot\nof the men in the army were that age.\n\"Stand firm. . .\" the young commander repeated. His voice sounded\nuncertain, and it trailed off as he noticed something in the distance. Sazed\nturned, following the man's gaze.\nThe koloss had gotten tired of standing around, piling up at a single\ngate. They were moving to surround the city, large groups of them breaking\nup, fording the River Channerel toward other gates.\nGates like Sazed's.\nVin landed directly in the middle of the camp. She tossed a handful of\npewter dust into the firepit, then Pushed, blowing coals, soot, and smoke\nacross a pair of surprised guards, who had been fixing breakfast. She\nreached out and Pulled out the stakes of the three small tents.\nAll three collapsed. One was unoccupied, but cries came from the\nother two.

The person in charge would be inside the larger one—and he was the\nman she would need to deal with. Probably one of Straff's captains, though\nthe guards didn't wear Venture heraldry. Perhaps—\nJastes Lekal poked his head out of his tent, cursing as he extricated\nhimself from the canvas. He'd changed much in the two years since Vin had\nlast seen him. However, there had been hints of what the man would\nbecome. His thin figure had become spindly; his balding head had fulfilled\nits promise. Yet, how had his face come to look so haggard. . .so old? He\nwas Elend's age.\n\"Jastes,\" Elend said, stepping out of his hiding place in the forest. He\nwalked into the clearing, Spook at his side. \"Why are you here?\"\nJastes managed to stand as his other two soldiers cut their way out of\ntheir tent. He waved them down. \"El,\" he said. \"I. . .didn't know where else\nto go. My scouts said that you were fleeing, and it seemed like a good idea.\nWherever you're going, I want to go with you. We can hide there, maybe.\nWe can—\"\n\"Jastes!\" Elend snapped, striding forward to stand beside Vin. \"Where\nare your koloss? Did you send them away?\"\n\"I tried,\" Jastes said, looking down. \"They wouldn't go—not once\nthey'd seen Luthadel. And then. . .\"\n\"What?\" Elend demanded.\n\"A fire,\" Jastes said. \"In our. . .supply carts.\"\nVin frowned.\n\"Your supply carts?\" Elend said. \"The carts where you carried your\nwooden coins?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Lord Ruler, man!\" Elend said stepping forward. \"And you just left\nthem there, without leadership, outside our home?\"\n\"They would have killed me, El!\" Jastes said. \"They were beginning to\nfight so much, to demand more coins, to demand we attack the city. If I'd\nstayed, they'd have slaughtered me! They're beasts—beasts that only barely\nhave the shape of man.\"\n\"And you left,\" Elend said. \"You abandoned Luthadel to them.\"\n\"You abandoned it, too,\" Jastes said. He walked forward, hands\npleading as he approached Elend. \"Look, El. I know I was wrong. I thought\nI could control them. I didn't mean for this to happen!\"\nElend fell silent, and Vin could see a hardness growing in his eyes. Not\na dangerous hardness, like Kelsier. More of a. . .regal bearing. The sense\nthat he was more than he wanted to be. He stood straight, looking down at\nthe man pleading before him.\n\"You raised an army of violent monsters and led them in a tyrannical\nassault, Jastes,\" Elend said. \"You caused the slaughter of innocent villages."

Bury him. Once you are\nthrough, you are welcome to travel with me to Terris, or you may go back\nto your homes.

An ashfall had begun, but most of the\nflakes got caught in the trees, coating their leaves like black moss.\n\"Elend?\" she asked.\nHe looked out, staring into the forest. \"I'm not sure why I did it, Vin,\"\nhe said quietly. \"Why should I be the one to bring justice? I'm not even\nking. And yet, it had to be done. I felt it. I feel it still.\"\nShe laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\"He's the first man I've ever killed,\" Elend said. \"He and I had such\ndreams, once: We'd ally two of the most powerful imperial houses, uniting\nLuthadel as never before.

I should take my own life with this sword.\"\n\"You left for a good reason, Elend,\" Vin said. \"You left to protect\nLuthadel, to make it so Straff wouldn't attack.\"\n\"And if the koloss attack before Straff can?\"\n\"Maybe they won't,\" Vin said. \"They don't have a leader—maybe\nthey'll attack Straff's army instead.\""

Allomancy was, fortunately, very easy on the body;\nAllomantic power came from within the metals themselves, not from the\none who burned them. Yet, Soothing was much more complex than other\nAllomantic skills, and it demanded constant attention.\n\"Fear, terror, anxiety. . .\" he whispered. \"The desire to run or give up. I\ntake these from you. . .\" The speaking wasn't necessary, of course, but it had\nalways been his way—it helped keep him focused.\nAfter a few more minutes of Soothing, he checked his pocket watch,\nthen turned his horse and trotted over to the other side of the courtyard. The\ngates continued to boom, and Breeze wiped his brow again. He noted, with\ndissatisfaction, that his handkerchief was nearly too damp to do him any\ngood. It was also beginning to snow. The wetness would make the ash stick\nto his clothing, and his suit would be absolutely ruined.\nThe suit will be ruined by your blood, Breeze, he told himself. The time\nfor silliness is over. This is serious. Far too serious. How did you even end\nup here?\nHe redoubled his efforts, Soothing a new group of soldiers. He was\none of the most powerful Allomancers in the Final Empire—especially\nwhen it came to emotional Allomancy. He could Soothe hundreds of men at\nonce, assuming they were packed close enough together, and assuming that\nhe was focusing on simple emotions. Even Kelsier hadn't been able to\nmanage those numbers.\nYet, the entire crowd of soldiers was beyond even his ability, and he\nhad to do them in sections. As he began work on the new group, he saw the\nones he had left begin to wilt, their anxiety taking over.\nWhen those doors burst, these men are going to scatter.\nThe gates boomed. Men clustered on the walls, throwing down rocks,\nshooting arrows, fighting with a frantic lack of discipline. Occasionally, an\nofficer would push his way past them, yelling orders, trying to coordinate\ntheir efforts, but Breeze was too far away to tell what they were saying. He\ncould just see the chaos of men moving, screaming, and shooting.\nAnd, of course, he could see the return fire. Rocks zipped into the air\nfrom below, some cracking against the ramparts. Breeze tried not to think\nabout what was on the other side of the wall, the thousands of enraged\nkoloss beasts. Occasionally, a soldier would drop. Blood dripped down into\nthe courtyard from several sections of the ramparts.\n\"Fear, anxiety, terror. . .\" Breeze whispered.\nAllrianne had escaped. Vin, Elend, and Spook were safe. He had to\nkeep focusing on those successes. Thank you, Sazed, for making us send\nthem away, he thought.\nHoofbeats clopped behind him.

Eventually,\nBreeze glanced over at Clubs, who sat, unperturbed, on his horse. \"You've\nbeen in combat before,\" Breeze said. \"How often?\"\n\"Off and on for the better part of twenty years, when I was younger,\"\nClubs said. \"Fighting rebellions in the distant dominances, warring against\nthe nomads out in the barrens. The Lord Ruler was pretty good about\nkeeping those conflicts quiet.\"\n\"And. . .how did you do?\" Breeze asked. \"Were you often victorious?\"\n\"Always,\" Clubs said.\nBreeze smiled slightly.\n\"Of course,\" Clubs said, glancing at Breeze, \"we were the ones with\nkoloss on our side. Damn hard to kill, those beasts.\"\nGreat, Breeze thought.\nVin ran.\nShe'd only been on one \"pewter drag\" before—with Kelsier, two years\nago. While burning pewter at a steady flare, one could run with incredible\nspeed—like a sprinter in their quickest dash—without ever growing tired.\nYet, the process did something to a body. Pewter kept her moving, but\nit also bottled up her natural fatigue. The juxtaposition made her mind fuzz,\nbringing on a trancelike state of exhausted energy. Her soul wanted so badly\nto rest, yet her body just kept running, and running, and running, following\nthe canal towpath toward the south. Toward Luthadel.\nVin was prepared for the effects of pewter dragging this time, and so\nshe handled them far better. She fought off the trance, keeping her mind\nfocused on her goal, not the repetitive motions of her body. However, that\nfocus led her to discomforting thoughts.\nWhy am I doing this? she wondered. Why push myself so hard? Spook\nsaid it—Luthadel has to have already fallen. There is no need for urgency.\nAnd yet, she ran.\nShe saw images of death in her mind. Ham, Breeze, Dockson, Clubs,\nand dear, dear Sazed. The first real friends she had ever known. She loved\nElend, and part of her blessed the others for sending him away from danger."

The young man looked like he should have been\ndancing at balls, not leading soldiers in battle.\n\"What did the messenger say?\" Bedes asked nervously.\n\"Zinc Gate has fallen, my lord,\" Sazed replied.\nThe young captain paled. \"What. . .what should we do?\"\n\"Why ask me, my lord?\" Sazed asked. \"You are in command.\"\n\"Please,\" the man said, grabbing Sazed's arm. \"I don't. . .I. . .\"\n\"My lord,\" Sazed said sternly, forcing down his own nervousness.\n\"You are a nobleman, are you not?\"\n\"Yes. . .\"\n\"Then you are accustomed to giving orders,\" Sazed said. \"Give them\nnow.\"\n\"Which orders?\"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Sazed said. \"Let the men see that you are in\ncharge.\"\nThe young man wavered, then yelped and ducked as a rock took one of\nthe nearby archers in the shoulder, throwing him back into the courtyard.\nThe men below scrambled out of the way of the corpse, and Sazed noticed\nsomething odd. A group of people had gathered at the back of the courtyard.\nCivilians—skaa—in ash-stained clothing.\n\"What are they doing here?\" Sazed asked. \"They should be hiding, not\nstanding here to tempt the koloss once the creatures break through!\"\n\"Once they break through?\" Captain Bedes asked.\nSazed ignored the man. Civilians he could deal with. He was\naccustomed to being in charge of a nobleman's servants.\n\"I will go speak to them,\" Sazed said.\n\"Yes. . .\" Bedes said. \"That sounds like a good idea.\"\nSazed made his way down the steps, which were growing slick and\nwet with ashen slush, then approached the group of people. There were\neven more of them than he had assumed; they extended back into the street\na short distance. The hundred or so people stood huddled together, watching\nthe gates through the falling snow, looking cold, and Sazed felt a little\nguilty for his brassmind's warmth.\nSeveral of the people bowed their heads as Sazed approached.\n\"Why are you here?\" Sazed asked. \"Please, you must seek shelter. If\nyour homes are near the courtyard, then go hide near the middle of the city.\nThe koloss are likely to begin pillaging as soon as they finish with the army,\nso the edges of the city are more dangerous.\"\nNone of the people moved.\n\"Please!\" Sazed said. \"You must go. If you stay, you will die!\"\n\"We are not here to die, Holy First Witness,\" said an elderly man at the\nfront. \"We are here to watch the koloss fall.\"\n\"Fall?\" Sazed asked.\n\"The Lady Heir will protect us,\" said another woman.\n\"The Lady Heir has left the city!\" Sazed said.\n\"Then we will watch you, Holy First Witness,\" the man said, leaning\nwith one hand on a young boy's shoulder.\n\"Holy First Witness?\" Sazed said. \"Why call me this name?\""

You\nwere the witness to her actions.\"\nSazed shook his head. \"That may be true, but I am not worthy of\nreverence. I'm not a holy man, I'm just a. . .\"\n\"A witness,\" the old man said. \"If the Heir is to join this fight, she will\nappear near you.\"\n\"I. . .am sorry. . .\" Sazed said, flushing. I sent her away. I sent your god\nto safety.\nThe people watched him, their eyes reverent. It was wrong; they\nshould not worship him. He was simply an observer.\nExcept, he wasn't. He had made himself part of this all. It was as\nTindwyl had indirectly warned him. Now that Sazed had participated in\nevents, he had become an object of worship himself.\n\"You should not look at me like that,\" Sazed said.\n\"The Lady Heir says the same thing,\" the old man said, smiling, breath\npuffing in the cold air.\n\"That is different,\" Sazed said. \"She is. . .\" He cut off, turning as he\nheard cries from behind. The archers on the wall were waving in alarm, and\nyoung Captain Bedes was rushing over to them. What is—\nA bestial blue creature suddenly pulled itself up onto the wall, its skin\nstreaked and dripping with scarlet blood. It shoved aside a surprised archer,\nthen grabbed Captain Bedes by the neck and tossed him backward. The boy\ndisappeared, falling to the koloss below. Sazed heard the screams even from\na distance. A second koloss pulled itself up onto the wall, then a third.\nArchers stumbled away in shock, dropping their weapons, some shoving\nothers off the ramparts in their haste.\nThe koloss are jumping up, Sazed realized. Enough corpses must have\npiled below. And yet, to jump so high. . .\nMore and more creatures were pulling themselves onto the top of the\nwall. They were the largest of the monsters, the ones over ten feet in height,\nbut that only made it easier for them to sweep the archers out of their way.\nMen fell to the courtyard, and the pounding on the gates redoubled.\n\"Go!\" Sazed said, waving at the people behind him. Some of them\nbacked away. Many stood firm.\nSazed turned desperately back toward the gates. The wooden structures\nbegan to crack, splinters spraying through the snowy, ash-laden air. The\nsoldiers backed away, postures frightened. Finally, with a snap, the bar\nbroke and the right gate burst open. A howling, bleeding, wild mass of\nkoloss began to scramble across the wet stones.\nSoldiers dropped their weapons and fled. Others remained, frozen with\nterror. Sazed stood at their back, between the horrified soldiers and the mass\nof skaa.\nI am not a warrior, he thought, hands shaking as he stared at the\nmonsters. It had been difficult enough to stay calm inside their camp."

He drew deeply upon his steelmind as he dashed\nforward, taking more strength than he ever had before. He had spent years\nstoring up strength, rarely finding occasion to use it, and now he tapped that\nreserve.\nHis body changed, weak scholar's arms transforming into massive,\nbulky limbs. His chest widened, bulging, and his muscles grew taut with\npower. Days spent fragile and frail focused on this single moment. He\nshoved his way through the ranks of soldiers, pulling his robe over his head\nas it grew too restrictive, leaving himself wearing only a vestigial loincloth.\nThe lead koloss turned to find himself facing a creature nearly his own\nsize. Despite its rage, despite its inhumanness, the beast froze, surprise\nshowing in its beady red eyes.\nSazed punched the monster. He hadn't practiced for war, and knew\nnext to nothing about combat. Yet, at that moment, his lack of skill didn't\nmatter. The creature's face folded around his fist, its skull cracking.\nSazed turned on thick legs, looking back at the startled soldiers. Say\nsomething brave! he told himself.\n\"Fight!\" Sazed bellowed, surprised at the sudden deepness and strength\nof his voice.\nAnd, startlingly, they did.\nVin fell to her knees, exhausted on the muddy, ash-soaked highway.\nHer fingers and knees hit the slushy cold, but she didn't care. She simply\nknelt, wheezing. She couldn't run any farther. Her pewter was gone. Her\nlungs burned and her legs ached. She wanted to collapse and curl up,\ncoughing.\nIt's just the pewter drag, she thought forcibly. She'd pushed her body\nhard, but hadn't had to pay for it until now.\nShe coughed a moment longer, groaning, then reached a dripping hand\ninto her pocket and pulled out her last two vials. They had a mixture of all\neight base metals, plus duralumin. Their pewter would keep her going for a\nlittle bit longer. . ..\nBut not long enough. She was still hours away from Luthadel. Even\nwith pewter, she wouldn't arrive until long after dark. She sighed, replacing\nher vials, forcing herself to her feet.\nWhat would I do if I arrived? Vin thought. Why work so hard? Am I\nthat eager to fight again? To slaughter?\nShe knew that she wouldn't arrive in time for the battle. In fact, the\nkoloss had probably attacked days ago. Still, this worried her. Her attack on\nCett's keep still flashed horrific images in her head. Things she had done.\nDeath she had caused.\nAnd yet, something felt different to her now. She had accepted her\nplace as a knife. But what was a knife, but another tool? It could be used for\nevil or for good; it could kill, or it could protect."

It could be used for\nevil or for good; it could kill, or it could protect.\nThat point was moot, considering how weak she felt. It was hard to\nkeep her legs from trembling as she flared tin, clearing her head. She stood\non the imperial highway, a sodden, pockmarked roadway that looked—in\nthe softly falling snow—to twist onward for eternity. It ran directly beside\nthe imperial canal, which was a snakelike cut in the land, wide but empty,\nextending beside the highway.\nBefore, with Elend, this road had seemed bright and new. Now it\nlooked dark and depressing. The Well thumped, its pulsings growing more\npowerful with each step she took back toward Luthadel. Yet, it wasn't\nhappening fast enough. Not fast enough for her to stop the koloss from\ntaking the city.\nNot fast enough for her friends.\nI'm sorry. . .she thought, teeth chattering as she pulled her cloak tight,\npewter no longer aiding her against the cold. I'm so sorry that I failed you.\nShe saw a line of smoke in the distance. She looked east, then west,\nbut didn't see much. The flat landscape was clouded in ashen snows.\nA village, thought her still-numb mind. One of many in the area.\nLuthadel was by far the dominant city of the small dominance, but there\nwere others. Elend hadn't been able to keep the others completely free of\nbanditry, but they had fared far better than towns in other areas of the Final\nEmpire.\nVin stumbled forward, pressing on through the slushy black puddles\ntoward the village. After about fifteen minutes of walking, she turned off the\nmain highway and made her way up a side road to the village. It was small,\neven by skaa standards. Just a few hovels, along with a couple of nicer\nstructures.\nNot a plantation, Vin thought. This was once a way village—a place\nfor traveling noblemen to stop for the evening. The small manor—which\nwould have once been run by a minor noble landlord—was dark. Two of the\nskaa hovels, however, had light shining through the cracks. The gloomy\nweather must have convinced the people to retire from their labors early.\nVin shivered, walking up to one of the buildings, her tin-enhanced ears\npicking out sounds of talking inside. She paused, listening. Children\nlaughed, and men spoke with gusto. She smelled what must have been the\nbeginnings of the evening meal—a simple vegetable stew.\nSkaa. . .laughing, she thought. A hovel like this one would have been a\nplace of fear and gloom during the days of the Lord Ruler. Happy skaa had\nbeen considered underworked skaa.\nWe've meant something. It's all meant something.\nBut was it worth the deaths of her friends? The fall of Luthadel?\nWithout Elend's protection, even this little village would soon be taken by\none tyrant or another.\nShe drank in the sounds of laughter. Kelsier hadn't given up.

Even\nwhen his plans had seemed hopeless, his own corpse lying in the street, he\nhad secretly been victorious.\nI refuse to give up, she thought, straightening. I refuse to accept their\ndeaths until I hold their corpses in my arms.\nShe raised a hand and pounded on the door. Immediately, the sounds\ninside stopped. Vin extinguished her tin as the door creaked open. Skaa,\nespecially country skaa, were skittish things. She'd probably have to—\n\"Oh, you poor thing!\" the woman exclaimed, pulling the door open the\nrest of the way. \"Come in out of that snow. What are you doing out there!\"\nVin hesitated. The woman was dressed simply, but the clothing was\nwell made to stave off the winter. The firepit in the center of the room\nglowed with a welcome warmth.\n\"Child?\" the woman asked. Behind, a stocky, bearded man rose to\nplace a hand on the woman's shoulder and study Vin.\n\"Pewter,\" Vin said quietly. \"I need pewter.\"\nThe couple looked at each other, frowning. They probably thought her\nmind addled. After all, how must she look, hair drenched by the snow,\nclothing wet and stuck with ash? She only wore simple riding clothing—\ntrousers and a nondescript cloak.\n\"Why don't you come inside, child?\" the man suggested. \"Have\nsomething to eat. Then we can talk about where you came from. Where are\nyour parents?\"\nLord Ruler! Vin thought with annoyance. I don't look that young, do I?\nShe threw a Soothing on the couple, suppressing their concern and\nsuspicion. Then, she Rioted their willingness to help. She wasn't as good as\nBreeze, but she wasn't unpracticed, either. The couple immediately relaxed.\n\"I don't have much time,\" Vin said. \"Pewter.\"\n\"The lord had some fine diningware in his home,\" the man said slowly.\n\"But we traded most of that for clothing and farming equipment. I think\nthere are a couple of goblets left. Master Cled—our elder—has them in the\nother hovel. . ..\"\n\"That might work,\" Vin said. Though the metal probably won't be\nmixed with Allomantic percentages in mind. It would probably have too\nmuch silver or not enough tin, making the pewter work more weakly than it\nwould otherwise.\nThe couple frowned, then looked at the others in the hovel.\nVin felt despair crawl back into her chest. What was she thinking?\nEven if the pewter were of the right alloy, it would take time to shave it and\nproduce enough for her to use in running. Pewter burned relatively quickly.\nShe'd need a lot of it. Preparing it could take almost as much time as simply\nwalking to Luthadel.\nShe turned, looking south, through the dark, snowy sky. Even with\npewter, it would take hours more running. What she really needed was a\nspikeway—a path marked by spikes driven in the ground that an\nAllomancer could push against, throwing themselves through the air again\nand again. On such an organized pathway, she'd once traveled from\nLuthadel to Fellise—an hour's carriage ride—in under ten minutes."

They were too hard to set up, too\nspecific in their usefulness, to be worth the bother of running them long\ndistances. . ..\nVin turned, causing the skaa couple to jump. Perhaps they'd noticed the\ndaggers in her belt, or perhaps it was the look in her eyes, but they no\nlonger looked quite as friendly as they had before.\n\"Is that a stable?\" Vin said, nodding toward one of the dark buildings.\n\"Yes,\" the man said hesitantly. \"But we have no horses. Only a couple\nof goats and cows. Surely you don't want to—\"\n\"Horseshoes,\" Vin said.\nThe man frowned.\n\"I need horseshoes,\" Vin said. \"A lot of them.\"\n\"Follow me,\" the man said, responding to her Soothing. He led her out\ninto the cold afternoon. Others followed behind them, and Vin noticed a\ncouple of men casually carrying cudgels. Perhaps it wasn't just Elend's\nprotection that had allowed these people to remain unmolested.\nThe stocky man threw his weight against the stable door, pushing it to\nthe side. He pointed to a barrel inside. \"They were getting rusty anyway,\" he\nsaid.\nVin walked up to the barrel and took out a horseshoe, testing its\nweight. Then she tossed it up in front of her and Pushed it with a solid flare\nof steel. It shot away, arcing far through the air until it splashed into a pool\nsome hundred paces away.\nPerfect, she thought.\nThe skaa men were staring. Vin reached into her pocket and pulled out\none of her metal vials, downing its contents and restoring her pewter. She\ndidn't have much of it left by pewter-dragging standards, but she had plenty\nof steel and iron. Both burned slowly. She could Push and Pull on metals\nfor hours yet.\n\"Prepare your village,\" she said, burning pewter, then counting out ten\nhorseshoes. \"Luthadel is besieged—it might have fallen already. If you get\nword that it has, I suggest you take your people and move to Terris. Follow\nthe imperial canal directly to the north.\"\n\"Who are you?\" the man asked.\n\"Nobody of consequence.\"\nHe paused. \"You're her, aren't you?\"\nShe didn't need to ask what he meant. She simply dropped a horseshoe\nto the ground behind her.\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, then Pushed off of the shoe.\nImmediately, she shot into the air at an angle. As she began to fall, she\ndropped another horseshoe. However, she waited until she was near the\nground to Push against this one; she needed to keep herself going more\nforward than up.\nShe'd done all this before. It wasn't that different from using coins to\njump around. The trick was going to be to keep herself moving. As she\nPushed against the second horseshoe—propelling herself into the snowy air\nagain—she reached behind herself and Pulled hard on the first horseshoe."

She let go of the first shoe, its momentum carrying it through\nthe air above her head. It fell to the ground as she Pushed against the third\nshoe and Pulled on the second one, now far behind her.\nThis is going to be tough, Vin thought, frowning with concentration as\nshe passed over the first shoe and Pushed on it. However, she didn't get the\nangle right, and she fell too far before Pushing. The horseshoe shot out\nbehind her, and didn't give her enough upward momentum to keep her in\nthe air. She hit the ground hard, but immediately Pulled the shoe to herself\nand tried again.\nThe first few tries were slow. The biggest problem was getting the\nangle down. She had to hit the shoe just right, giving it enough downward\nforce to keep it in place on the ground, but enough forward motion to keep\nher moving in the right direction. She had to land often that first hour, going\nback to fetch horseshoes. However, she didn't have time for much\nexperimentation, and her determination insisted that she get the process\nright.\nEventually, she had three shoes working pretty well; it helped that the\nground was wet, and that her weight pressed the horseshoes down in the\nmud, giving her a stronger anchor to use when Pushing herself forward.\nSoon she was able to add a fourth shoe. The more frequently she Pushed—\nthe more horseshoes she had to Push against—the faster she would go.\nBy the time she was an hour out of the village, she added a fifth shoe.\nThe result was a continuous flow of flipping metal chunks. Vin Pulled, then\nPushed, then Pulled, then Pushed, moving with continual single-\nmindedness, juggling herself through the air.\nThe ground raced beneath her and horseshoes shot through the air\nabove her. The wind became a roar as she Pushed herself faster and faster,\nsteering her pathway to the south. She was a flurry of metal and motion—as\nKelsier had been, near the end, when he had killed the Inquisitor.\nExcept, her metal wasn't meant to kill, but save.

In fact, he felt\nwonderful.\nHe was sure the same couldn't be said for those in Luthadel. The\nkoloss pooled around the outer wall, still beating on several of the gates on\nthe north and east sides. Smoke rose from inside the city.\n\"Our scouts say the creatures have broken through four of the city\ngates, my lord,\" said Lord Janarle. \"They breached the eastern gate first, and\nthere met with heavy resistance. The northeastern gate fell next, then the\nnorthwestern gate, but the troops at both are holding as well. The main\nbreach happened in the north. The koloss are apparently ravaging from that\ndirection, burning and looting.\"\nStraff nodded. The northern gate, he thought. The one closest to Keep\nVenture.\n\"Do we attack, my lord?\" Janarle asked.\n\"How long ago did the northern gate fall?\"\n\"Perhaps an hour ago, my lord.\"\nStraff shook his head leisurely. \"Then, let us wait. The creatures\nworked quite hard to break into the city—we should at least let them have a\nlittle fun before we slaughter them.\"\n\"Are you sure, my lord?\"\nStraff smiled. \"Once they lose their bloodlust in a few hours, they'll be\ntired from all the fighting and calm down. That will be the best time to\nstrike. They'll be dispersed through the city and weakened from the\nresistance. We can take them easily, that way.\"\nSazed gripped his koloss opponent by the throat, forcing back its\nsnarling, distorted face. The beast's skin was stretched so tightly that it had\nsplit down the center of the face, revealing bloody muscles above the teeth,\naround the nose holes. It breathed with husky rage, spraying droplets of\nspittle and blood across Sazed with each exhalation.\nStrength! Sazed thought, tapping his pewtermind for more power. His\nbody became so massive that he feared splitting his own skin. Fortunately,\nhis metalminds had been built to expand, braces and rings that didn't\nconnect on one side so that they could bend. Still, his bulk was daunting. He\nprobably wouldn't have been able to walk or maneuver with such size—but\nit didn't matter, for the koloss had already knocked him to the ground. All\nhe needed was some extra power in his grip. The creature clawed him in the\narm with one hand, reaching behind with the other, grasping its sword. . ..\nSazed's fingers finally crushed the beast's thick neck. The creature tried\nto snarl, but no breath came, and it instead thrashed about in frustration.\nSazed forced himself to his feet, then hurled the creature toward its\ncompanions. With such unnatural strength, even a body eleven feet tall felt\nlight in his fingers. It smashed into a pile of attacking koloss, forcing them\nbackward.\nSazed stood, gasping.

Though koloss had broken through the gate,\nonly a few could pass through at once—and only the most massive seemed\nable to jump up to the wall.\nSazed's little troop of soldiers was sorely pressed, however. Bodies lay\nscattered in the courtyard. The skaa faithful at the back had begun pulling\nthe wounded to safety. Sazed could hear them groaning behind him.\nKoloss corpses littered the square as well, and despite the carnage,\nSazed couldn't help but feel a sense of pride at how much it was costing the\ncreatures to force their way inside this portal. Luthadel was not falling\neasily. Not at all.\nThe koloss seemed rebuffed for the moment, and though several\nskirmishes still continued in the courtyard, a new group of monsters was\ngathering outside the gate.\nOutside the gate, Sazed thought, glancing to the side. The creatures\nhad cared to break open only one of the massive door gates, the right one.\nThere were corpses in the square—dozens, perhaps hundreds—but the\nkoloss themselves had cleared many out of the way of the gate itself so that\nthey could get into the courtyard.\nPerhaps. . .\nSazed didn't have time to think. He dashed forward, tapping his\npewtermind again, giving himself the strength of five men. He picked up\nthe body of a smaller koloss and threw it out the gate. The creatures outside\nsnarled, scattering. There were still hundreds waiting for the chance to get\nin, but they tripped over the dead in their haste to get out of the way of his\nprojectile.\nSazed slipped on blood as he grabbed a second body, throwing it to the\nside. \"To me!\" he screamed, hoping that there were men who could hear,\nand who could respond.\nThe koloss realized what he was doing too late. He kicked another\nbody out of the way, then slammed his body against the open door and\ntapped his ironmind, drawing forth the weight he had stored within it.\nImmediately, he became far heavier, and that weight crashed against the\ngate, slamming it closed.\nKoloss rushed at the doorway from the other side. Sazed scrambled up\nagainst the gate, pushing corpses out of the way, forcing the massive portal\nclosed all the way. He tapped his ironmind further, draining its precious\nreserve at an alarming rate. He became so heavy he felt his own weight\ncrushing him to the ground, and only his increased strength managed to\nkeep him on his feet. Frustrated koloss pounded on the gate, but he held.\nHeld them back, hands and chest pressed against the rough wood, toes\nwedged back against uneven cobbles.

Fortunately, stretching\nhis body in such a manner didn't leave his skin loose. He went back to his\nusual self, only bearing a dreadful sense of exhaustion and a faint soreness.\nThe koloss continued to beat on the gate. Sazed opened tired eyes, lying\nbare-chested in the falling snow and ash. His soldiers stood solemnly before\nhim.\nSo few, he thought. Barely fifty remained of his original four hundred.\nThe square itself was red—as if painted—with bright koloss blood, and it\nmixed with the darker human kind. Sickly blue lumps of bodies lay alone or\nin heaps, interspersed with the twisted and torn pieces that were often all\nthat remained of human bodies once they were hit by the brutal koloss\nswords.\nThe thumping continued, like low drums, on the other side of the gate.\nThe beating picked up to a frenzied pace, the gate shaking, as the koloss\ngrew more frustrated. They could probably smell the blood, feel the flesh\nthat had so nearly been theirs.\n\"That board won't hold for long,\" one of the soldiers said quietly, a bit\nof ash floating down in front of his face. \"And the hinges are splintering.\nThey're going to get through again.\"\nSazed stumbled to his feet. \"And we will fight again.\"\n\"My lord!\" a voice said. Sazed turned to see one of Dockson's\nmessengers ride around a pile of corpses. \"Lord Dockson says that. . .\" He\ntrailed off, noticing for the first time that Sazed's gate was closed. \"How. . .\"\nthe man began.\n\"Deliver your message, young man,\" Sazed said tiredly.\n\"Lord Dockson says you won't get any reinforcements,\" the man said,\nreining in his horse. \"Tin Gate has fallen, and—\"\n\"Tin Gate?\" Sazed asked. Tindwyl! \"When?\"\n\"Over an hour ago, my lord.\""

How long have we been fighting?\n\"You have to hold here, my lord!\" the young man said, turning and\ngalloping back the way he had come.\nSazed took a step to the east. Tindwyl. . ..\nThe thumping on his gate grew louder, and the board began to crack.\nThe men ran for something else to use to secure the gate, but Sazed could\nsee that the mountings that kept the board in place were beginning to pull\napart. Once they went, there would be no way to hold the gate closed.\nSazed closed his eyes, feeling the weight of fatigue, reaching into his\npewtermind. It was nearly drained. After it was gone, he'd only have the\ntiny bit of strength in one of the rings.\nYet, what else could he do?\nHe heard the board snap, and men yelled.\n\"Back!\" Clubs yelled. \"Fall into the city!\"\nThe remnants of their army broke apart, pulling back from Zinc Gate.\nBreeze watched with horror as more and more koloss spilled into the\nsquare, overrunning the few men too weak or too wounded to retreat. The\ncreatures swept forward like a great blue tide, a tide with swords of steel\nand eyes of red.\nIn the sky, the sun—only faintly visible behind storm clouds—was a\nbleeding scar that crept toward the horizon.\n\"Breeze,\" Clubs snapped, pulling him back. \"Time to go.\"\nTheir horses had long since bolted. Breeze stumbled after the general,\ntrying not to listen to the snarling from behind.\n\"Fall back to the harrying positions!\" Clubs called to those men who\ncould hear him. \"First squad, shore up inside Keep Lekal! Lord Hammond\nshould be there by now, preparing the defenses! Squad two, with me to\nKeep Hasting!\"\nBreeze continued on, his mind as numb as his feet. He'd been virtually\nuseless in the battle. He'd tried to take away the men's fear, but his efforts\nhad seemed so inadequate. Like. . .holding a piece of paper up to the sun to\nmake shade.\nClubs held up a hand, and the squad of two hundred men stopped.\nBreeze looked around. The street was quiet in the falling ash and snow.\nEverything seemed. . .dull. The sky was dim, the city's features softened by\nthe blanket of black-speckled snow. It seemed so strange to have fled the\nhorrific scene of scarlet and blue to find the city looking so lazy.\n\"Damn!\" Clubs snapped, pushing Breeze out of the way as a raging\ngroup of koloss burst from a side street. Clubs's soldiers fell into a line, but\nanother group of koloss—the creatures that had just burst through the gate\n—came up behind them.\nBreeze stumbled, falling in the snow.

Clubs\ngrunted, thrown to the side, his sword arm—weapon and all—flying free.\nHe stumbled on his bad leg, and the koloss brought his sword down in a\ntwo-handed blow.\nThe dirty snow finally got some color. A splash of red.\nBreeze stared, dumbfounded, at the remains of his friend's corpse.\nThen the koloss turned toward Breeze, snarling.\nThe likelihood of his own impending death hit, stirring him as even the\ncold snow couldn't. Breeze scrambled back, sliding in the snow,\ninstinctively reaching out to try and Soothe the creature. Of course, nothing\nhappened. Breeze tried to get to his feet, and the koloss—along with several\nothers—began to bear down on him. At that moment, however, another\ntroop of soldiers fleeing the gate appeared from a cross street, distracting\nthe koloss.\nBreeze did the only thing that seemed natural. He crawled inside a\nbuilding and hid.\n\"This is all Kelsier's fault,\" Dockson muttered, making another\nnotation on his map. According to messengers, Ham had reached Keep\nLekal. It wouldn't last long.\nThe Venture grand hall was a flurry of motion and chaos as panicked\nscribes ran this way and that, finally realizing that koloss didn't care if a\nman were skaa, scholar, nobleman, or merchant. The creatures just liked to\nkill.\n\"He should have seen this coming,\" Dockson continued. \"He left us\nwith this mess, and then he just assumed that we'd find a way to fix it. Well,\nI can't hide a city from its enemies—not like I hid a crew. Just because we\nwere excellent thieves doesn't mean we'd be any good at running a\nkingdom!\"\nNobody was listening to him. His messengers had all fled, and his\nguards fought at the keep gates. Each of the keeps had its own defenses, but\nClubs—rightly—had decided to use them only as a fallback option. They\nweren't designed to repel a large-scale attack, and they were too secluded\nfrom each other. Retreating to them only fractured and isolated the human\narmy.\n\"Our real problem is follow-through,\" Dockson said, making a final\nnotation at Tin Gate, explaining what had happened there. He looked over\nthe map. He'd never expected Sazed's gate to be the last one to hold.\n\"Follow-through,\" he continued. \"We assumed we could do a better job\nthan the noblemen, but once we had the power, we put them back in charge.\nIf we'd killed the whole lot, perhaps then we could have started fresh. Of\ncourse, that would have meant invading the other dominances—which\nwould have meant sending Vin to take care of the most important, most\nproblematic, noblemen.

Even broken, the windows were beautiful, the spiked\nglass edges twinkling in the evening light. Through one of them, Dockson\ncould see that the storm was breaking, letting sunlight through.\n\"If we'd done that,\" Dockson said quietly, \"we'd have been no better\nthan beasts.\"\nScribes screamed, trying to flee as the koloss began the slaughter.\nDockson stood quietly, hearing noise behind—grunts, harsh breathing—as\nkoloss approached through the back hallways. He reached for the sword on\nhis table as men began to die.\nHe closed his eyes. You know, Kell, he thought. I almost started to\nbelieve that they were right, that you were watching over us. That you were\nsome sort of god.\nHe opened his eyes and turned, pulling the sword from its sheath. Then\nhe froze, staring at the massive beast approaching from behind. So big!\nDockson gritted his teeth, sending a final curse Kelsier's way, then\ncharged, swinging.\nThe creature caught his weapon in an indifferent hand, ignoring the cut\nit caused. Then, it brought its own weapon down, and blackness followed.\n\"My lord,\" Janarle said. \"The city has fallen. Look, you can see it\nburning. The koloss have penetrated all but one of the four gates under\nattack, and they run wild in the city. They aren't stopping to pillage—they're\njust killing. Slaughtering. There aren't many soldiers left to oppose them.\"\nStraff sat quietly, watching Luthadel burn. It seemed. . .a symbol to\nhim. A symbol of justice. He'd fled this city once, leaving it to the skaa\nvermin inside, and when he'd come back to demand it be returned to him,\nthe people had resisted.\nThey had been defiant. They had earned this.\n\"My lord,\" Janarle said. \"The koloss army is weakened enough\nalready. Their numbers are hard to count, but the corpses they left behind\nindicate that as much as a third of their force has fallen. We can take them!\"\n\"No,\" Straff said, shaking his head. \"Not yet.\"\n\"My lord?\" Janarle said.\n\"Let the koloss have the damn city,\" Straff said quietly. \"Let them clear\nit out and burn the whole thing to the ground. Fires can't hurt our atium—in\nfact, they'll probably make the metal easier to find.\"\n\"I. . .\" Janarle seemed shocked. He didn't object further, but his eyes\nwere rebellious.\nI'll have to take care of him later, Straff thought. He'll rise against me\nif he finds that Zane is gone.\nThat didn't matter at the moment. The city had rejected him, and so it\nwould die. He'd build a better one in its place.\nOne dedicated to Straff, not the Lord Ruler.\n\"Father!\" Allrianne said urgently.\nCett shook his head.

He'd grown used to her manipulations long ago. \"Our help\nwouldn't matter now.\"\n\"We have to do something!\" Allrianne said, pulling his arm.\n\"No,\" Cett said more forcefully.\n\"But you came back!\" she said. \"Why did we return, if not to help?\"\n\"We will help,\" Cett said quietly. \"We'll help Straff take the city when\nhe wishes, then we'll submit to him and hope he doesn't kill us.\"\nAllrianne paled. \"That's it?\" she hissed. \"That's why we returned, so\nthat you can give our kingdom to that monster?\"\n\"What else did you expect?\" Cett demanded. \"You know me,\nAllrianne.

And yet,\nsomehow, he managed to stay alive.\nPerhaps it was because the koloss didn't fight with skill, either. They\nwere blunt—like their giant, wedgelike swords—and they simply threw\nthemselves at their opponents with little thought of tactics.\nThat should have been enough. Yet, Sazed held—and where he held,\nhis few men held with him. The koloss had rage on their side, but Sazed's\nmen could see the weak and elderly standing, waiting, just at the edge of the\nsquare. The soldiers knew why they fought. This reminder seemed enough\nto keep them going, even when they began to be surrounded, the koloss\nworking their way into the edges of the square.\nSazed knew, by now, that no relief was going to come. He'd hoped,\nperhaps, that Straff would decide to take the city, as Clubs had suggested.\nBut it was too late for that; night was approaching, the sun inching toward\nthe horizon.\nThe end is finally here, Sazed thought as the man next to him was\nstruck down. Sazed slipped on blood, and the move saved him as the koloss\nswung over his head.\nPerhaps Tindwyl had found a way to safety. Hopefully, Elend would\ndeliver the things he and she had studied.

The resistance, the wet sound of impact, the shock up his arm\n—these were familiar to him now.

He\ntried to swing it at the next koloss in line, but the weapon slipped from his\nweak, numb, tired fingers.\nThis koloss was a big one. Nearing twelve feet tall, it was the largest of\nthe monsters Sazed had seen. Sazed tried to step away, but he stumbled over\nthe body of a recently killed soldier. As he fell, his men finally broke, the\nlast dozen scattering. They'd held well. Too well. Perhaps if he'd let them\nretreat. . .\nNo, Sazed thought, looking up at his death. I did well, I think. Better\nthan any mere scholar should have been able to.\nHe thought about the rings on his fingers. They could, perhaps, give\nhim a little bit of an edge, let him run. Flee. Yet, he couldn't summon the\nmotivation. Why resist? Why had he resisted in the first place? He'd known\nthat they were doomed.\nYou're wrong about me, Tindwyl, he thought. I do give up, sometimes. I\ngave up on this city long ago.\nThe koloss loomed over Sazed, who still lay half sprawled in the\nbloody slush, and raised its sword. Over the creature's shoulder, Sazed\ncould see the red sun hanging just above the top of the wall. He focused on\nthat, rather than on the falling sword. He could see rays of sunlight, like. .\n.shards of glass in the sky.\nThe sunlight seemed to sparkle, twinkling, coming for him. As if the\nsun itself were welcoming him. Reaching down to accept his spirit.\nAnd so, I die. . ..\nA twinkling droplet of light sparkled in the beam of sunlight, then hit\nthe koloss directly in the back of the skull.

Then he looked up at the top of the wall.\nA small figure stood silhouetted by the sun. Black before the red light,\na cloak flapped gently on her back. Sazed blinked. The bit of sparkling light\nhe'd seen. . .it had been a coin. The koloss before him was dead.\nVin had returned.\nShe jumped, leaping as only an Allomancer could, to soar in a graceful\narc above the square. She landed directly in the midst of the koloss and\nspun. Coins shot out like angry insects, cutting through blue flesh. The\ncreatures didn't drop as easily as humans would have, but the attack got\ntheir attention. The koloss turned away from the fleeing soldiers and\ndefenseless townspeople.\nThe skaa at the back of the square began to chant. It was a bizarre\nsound to hear in the middle of a battle.

She must be Pulling on something\nbehind herself—but, that would mean that poor Vin is being yanked between\ntwo weights as heavy as that gate.\nAnd yet, she did it, lifting the gate door with a heave, Pulling it toward\nherself. The huge hardwood gate crashed through the koloss ranks,\nscattering bodies. Vin twisted expertly in the air, Pulling herself to the side,\nswinging the gate to the side as if it were tethered to her by a chain.\nKoloss flew in the air, bones cracking, sprayed like splinters before the\nenormous weapon. In a single sweep, Vin cleared the entire courtyard.\nThe gate dropped. Vin landed amid a group of crushed bodies, silently\nkicking a soldier's war staff up into her hands. The remaining koloss outside\nthe gate paused only briefly, then charged. Vin began to attack swiftly, but\nprecisely. Skulls cracked, koloss falling dead in the slush as they tried to\npass her. She spun, sweeping a few of them to the ground, spraying ashen\nred slush across those running up behind.\nI. . .I have to do something, Sazed thought, shaking off his\nstupefaction.

Then, thankfully, he nodded.\n\"We'll run out the northern gate,\" Sazed said urgently. \"That is where\nthe koloss first entered the city, and so it is likely that they have moved on\nfrom that area.\"\nI hope, Sazed thought, rushing off to raise the warning. The fallback\ndefensive positions were supposed to be the high noble keeps. Perhaps they\nwould find survivors there.\nSo, Breeze thought, it turns out that I'm a coward.\nIt was not a surprising revelation. He had always said that it was\nimportant for a man to understand himself, and he had always been aware\nof his selfishness.

Vin jumped, and the sword collided with\nbroken cobblestones beneath her. She shot upward, not needing any coins to\ncarry herself up to eye level with the creature's twisted face.\nThey always looked surprised. Even after watching her fight dozens of\ntheir companions, they seemed shocked to see her dodge their blows. Their\nminds seemed to equate size with power; a larger koloss always beat a\nsmaller one. A five-foot-tall human should have been no problem for a\nmonster this big.\nVin flared pewter as she smashed her fist into the beast's head. The\nskull cracked beneath her knuckles, and the beast fell backward as she\ndropped back to the ground. Yet, as always, there was another to take its\nplace.\nShe was getting tired. No, she'd started the battle tired. She'd pewter-\ndragged, then used a convoluted personal spikeway to carry herself across\nan entire dominance. She was exhausted. Only the pewter in her last metal\nvial was keeping her upright.\nI should have asked Sazed for one of his empty pewterminds! she\nthought. Feruchemical and Allomantic metals were the same. She could\nhave burned that—though it would probably have been a bracer or a\nbracelet. To large to swallow.\nShe ducked to the side as another koloss attacked. Coins didn't stop\nthese things, and they all weighed too much for her to Push them away\nwithout an anchor. Besides, her steel and iron reserves were extremely low.\nShe killed koloss after koloss, buying time for Sazed and the people to\nget a good head start. Something was different this time—different from\nwhen she'd killed at Cett's palace. She felt good. It wasn't just because she\nkilled monsters.\nIt was because she understood her purpose. And she agreed with it.\nShe could fight, could kill, if it meant defending those who could not defend\nthemselves. Kelsier might have been able to kill for shock or retribution,\nbut that wasn't good enough for Vin.\nAnd she would never let it be again.\nThat determination fueled her attacks against the koloss. She used a\nstolen sword to cut off the legs of one, then threw the weapon at another,\nPushing on it to impale the koloss in the chest. Then she Pulled on the\nsword of a fallen soldier, yanking it into her hand. She ducked backward,\nbut nearly stumbled as she stepped on another body.\nSo tired, she thought.\nThere were dozens—perhaps even hundreds—of corpses in the\ncourtyard. In fact, a pile was forming beneath her. She climbed it, retreating\nslightly as the creatures surrounded her again.

Now they would\nslaughter the people. There were hundreds of thousands of them, and Sazed\nknew the creatures would gleefully extend the devastation. No looting. Not\nwhen there was killing to be done.\nMore screams sounded in the night. They'd lost. Failed. And now, the\ncity would truly fall.\nThe mists can't be far away, he thought, trying to give himself some\nhope. Perhaps that will give us some cover.\nStill, one image stood out to him. Clubs, dead in the snow. The\nwooden disk Sazed had given him earlier that same day tied to a loop\naround his neck.\nIt hadn't helped.\nSazed turned back to Keep Hasting. \"Lord Penrod,\" he said loudly.\n\"We are going to try and slip out of the city. I would welcome your troops\nand your leadership. If you stay here, the koloss will attack this keep and\nkill you.\"\nSilence.\nSazed turned, sighing as Ham—arm still in a sling—joined him. \"We\nhave to go, Saze,\" Ham said quietly.\n\"You're bloody, Terrisman.\"\nSazed turned.

He still looked immaculate in his nobleman's suit. He even wore a\nhat against the snow and ash. Sazed looked down at himself. He still wore\nonly his loincloth. He hadn't had time to worry about clothing, particularly\nwith his brassmind to keep him warm.\n\"I've never seen a Terrisman fight,\" Penrod said.\n\"It is not a common occurrence, my lord,\" Sazed replied.\nPenrod looked up, staring out over the city. \"It's falling, Terrisman.\"\n\"That is why we must go, my lord,\" Sazed said.\nPenrod shook his head. He still wore Elend's thin crown. \"This is my\ncity, Terrisman. I will not abandon it.\"\n\"A noble gesture, my lord,\" Sazed said. \"But these with me are your\npeople. Will you abandon them in their flight northward?\"\nPenrod paused. Then he just shook his head again. \"There will be no\nflight northward, Terrisman. Keep Hasting is among the tallest structures in\nthe city—from it, we can see what the koloss are doing. They will not let\nyou escape.\"\n\"They may turn to pillaging,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps we can get by them\nand escape.\"\n\"No,\" Penrod said, his voice echoing hauntingly across the snowy\nstreets. \"My Tineye claims the creatures have already attacked the people\nyou sent to escape through the northern gate. Now the koloss have turned\nthis way. They're coming for us.\"\nAs cries began to echo through the distant streets, coming closer,\nSazed knew that Penrod's words must be true. \"Open your gates, Penrod!\"\nSazed yelled. \"Let the refugees in!\" Save their lives for a few more pitiful\nmoments.\n\"There is no room,\" Penrod said. \"And there is no time. We are\ndoomed.\"\n\"You must let us in!\" Sazed screamed.\n\"It is odd,\" Penrod said, voice growing softer. \"By taking this throne\nfrom the Venture boy, I saved his life—and I ended my own. I could not\nsave the city, Terrisman. My only consolation is that I doubt Elend could\nhave done so either.\"\nHe turned to go, walking down somewhere beyond the wall.\n\"Penrod!\" Sazed yelled.\nHe did not reappear. The sun was setting, the mists were appearing,\nand the koloss were coming.\nVin cut down another koloss, then jumped back, Pushing herself off of\na fallen sword. She shot away from the pack, breathing heavily, bleeding\nfrom a couple of minor cuts. Her arm was growing numb; one of the\ncreatures had punched her there. She could kill—kill better than anyone she\nknew. However, she couldn't fight forever.\nShe landed on a rooftop, then stumbled, falling to kneel in a pile of\nsnow. The koloss called and howled behind her, and she knew they would\ncome, chasing her, hounding her. She'd killed hundreds of them, but what\nwas a few hundred when compared with an army of over twenty thousand?\nWhat did you expect? she thought to herself. Why keep fighting once"

Why keep fighting once\nyou knew Sazed was free? Did you think to stop them all? Kill every koloss\nin the army?\nOnce, she'd stopped Kelsier from rushing an army by himself. He had\nbeen a great man, but still just one person. He couldn't have stopped an\nentire army—no more than she could.\nI have to find the Well, she thought with determination, burning bronze,\nthe thumpings—which she'd been ignoring during the battle—becoming\nloud to her ears.\nAnd yet, that left her with the same problem as before. She knew it\nwas in the city now; she could feel the thumpings all around her. Yet, they\nwere so powerful, so omnipresent, that she couldn't sense a direction from\nthem.\nBesides, what proof did she have that finding the Well would even\nhelp? If Sazed had lied about the location—had gone so far as to draw up a\nfake map—then what else had he lied about? The power might stop the\nmists, but what good would that do for Luthadel, burning and dying?\nShe knelt in frustration, pounding the top of the roof with her fists. She\nhad proven too weak. What good was it to return—what good was it to\ndecide to protect—if she couldn't do anything to help?\nShe knelt for a few moments, breathing in gasps. Finally, she forced\nherself to her feet and jumped into the air, throwing down a coin. Her\nmetals were nearly gone. She barely had enough steel to carry her through a\nfew jumps. She ended up slowing near Kredik Shaw, the Hill of a Thousand\nSpires. She caught one of the spikes at the top of the palace, spinning in the\nnight, looking out over the darkening city.\nIt was burning.\nKredik Shaw itself was silent, quiet, left alone by looters of both races.\nYet, all around her, Vin saw light in the darkness. The mists glowed with a\nhaunting light.\nIt's like. . .like that day two years ago, she thought. The night of the\nskaa rebellion. Except, on that day, the firelight had come from the torches\nof the rebels as they marched on the palace. This night, a revolution of a\ndifferent type was occurring. She could hear it. She had her tin burning, and\nshe forced herself to flare it, opening her ears. She heard the screams. The\ndeath. The koloss hadn't finished their killing work by destroying the army.\nNot by far.\nThey had only just begun.\nThe koloss are killing them all, she thought, shivering as the fires\nburned before her. Elend's people, the ones he left behind because of me.\nThey're dying.\nI am his knife. Their knife. Kelsier trusted me with them. I should be\nable to do something. . ..\nShe dropped toward the ground, skidding off an angled rooftop,\nlanding in the palace courtyard. Mists gathered around her. The air was\nthick. And not just with ash and snow; she could smell death in its breezes,\nhear screams in its whispers."

She suddenly knew she\nshouldn't have relied on the pewter so much. Shouldn't have pushed herself\nso hard.

Elend's city. . .Elend's people. . .dying. Her friends were out there\nsomewhere. Friends that Kelsier had trusted her to protect.\nShe gritted her teeth, shoving aside the exhaustion for a moment\nlonger, struggling up to her feet. She looked through the mists, toward the\nphantom sounds of terrified people. She began to dash toward them.\nShe couldn't jump; she was out of steel. She couldn't even run very\nfast, but as she forced her body to move, it responded better and better,\nfighting off the dull numbness that she'd earned from relying on pewter so\nlong.\nShe burst out of an alleyway, skidding in the snow, and found a small\ngroup of people running before a koloss raiding party. There were six of the\nbeasts, small ones, but still dangerous. Even as Vin watched, one of the\ncreatures cut down an elderly man, slicing him nearly in two. Another\npicked up a small girl, slamming her against the side of a building.\nVin dashed forward, past the fleeing skaa, whipping out her daggers.\nShe still felt exhausted, but adrenaline helped her somewhat. She had to\nkeep moving. Keep going. To stop was to die.\nSeveral of the beasts turned toward her, eager to fight. One swung for\nher, and Vin let herself slide in the slush—slipping closer to him—before\ncutting the back of his leg. He howled in pain as her knife got caught in his\nbaggy skin. She managed to yank it free as a second creature swung.\nI feel so slow! she thought with frustration, barely sliding to her feet\nbefore backing away from the creature's reach. His sword sprayed chill\nwater across her, and she jumped forward, planting a dagger in the\ncreature's eye.\nSuddenly thankful for the times Ham had made her practice without\nAllomancy, she caught the side of a building to steady herself in the slush.\nThen she threw herself forward, shouldering the koloss with the wounded\neye—he was clawing at the dagger and yelling—into his companions. The\nkoloss with the young girl turned, shocked, as Vin rammed her other dagger\ninto his back. He didn't drop, but he did let go of the child.\nLord Ruler, these things are tough! she thought, cloak whipping as she\ngrabbed the child and dashed away. Especially when you're not tough\nyourself.

Vin looked up, only to find those she'd\njust rescued facing down an even larger group of koloss.\n\"No!\" Vin said, raising a hand. But, they'd run far while she'd been\nfighting. She wouldn't even have been able to see them, save for her tin. As\nit was, she was able to see painfully well as the creatures began to lay into\nthe small group with their thick-bladed swords.\n\"No!\" Vin screamed again, the deaths startling her, shocking her,\nstanding as a reminder of all the deaths she'd been unable to prevent.\n\"No. No!

Was it because she had\nbeen frustrated?\nNo. She knew that the Lord Ruler had built the Inquisitors with a\nweakness: Remove a particular spike from their back, and they'd die. He\nhad also built the kandra with a weakness. The koloss had to have a\nweakness, too.\nTenSoon called the koloss. . .his cousins, she thought.\nShe stood upright, the dark street suddenly quiet save for the\nwhimpering skaa. The koloss waited, and she could feel herself in their\nminds. As if they were an extension of her own body, the same thing she\nhad felt when she'd taken control of TenSoon's body.\nCousins indeed. The Lord Ruler had built the koloss with a weakness\n—the same weakness as the kandra. He had given himself a way to keep\nthem in check.\nAnd suddenly she understood how he'd controlled them all those long\nyears.\nSazed stood at the head of his large band of refugees, snow and ash—\nthe two now indistinguishable in the misty darkness—falling around him.\nHam sat to one side, looking drowsy.

Even though be barely\ntapped his brassmind for warmth, Sazed himself wasn't cold.\nMaybe he was just getting too numb to care.\nHe held two hands up before him, forming fists, ten rings sparkling\nagainst the light of the group's single lantern.

Then, the koloss began to move again. Sazed\ntensed, but the creatures didn't walk forward. They split, and a quiet figure\nwalked through the center of them.\n\"Lady Vin?\" Sazed asked. He still hadn't had a chance to speak with\nher since she'd saved him at the gate. She looked exhausted.\n\"Sazed,\" she said tiredly. \"You lied to me about the Well of\nAscension.\"\n\"Yes, Lady Vin,\" he said.\n\"That isn't important now,\" she said. \"Why are you standing naked\noutside of the keep's walls?\"\n\"I. . .\" He looked up at the koloss. \"Lady Vin, I—\"\n\"Penrod!\" Vin shouted suddenly. \"Is that you up there?\"\nThe king appeared.

She turned, and a group of koloss moved\nforward, walking quietly as if commanded. The largest one picked Vin up,\nholding her up high, until she was nearly level with the top of the keep's\nlow wall. Several guards atop the wall shied away from her.\n\"I'm tired, Penrod,\" Vin said. Sazed had to tap his hearing tinmind to\nlisten in on her words.\n\"We're all tired, child,\" Penrod said.\n\"I'm particularly tired,\" Vin said. \"I'm tired of the games. I'm tired of\npeople dying because of arguments between their leaders. I'm tired of good\nmen being taken advantage of.\"\nPenrod nodded quietly.\n\"I want you to gather our remaining soldiers,\" Vin said, turning to look\nover the city. \"How many do you have in there?\"\n\"About two hundred,\" he said.\nVin nodded. \"The city is not lost—the koloss have fought against the\nsoldiers, but haven't had much time to turn on the population yet. I want\nyou to send out your soldiers to find any groups of koloss that are pillaging\nor killing. Protect the people, but don't attack the koloss if you can help it.\nSend a messenger for me instead.\"\nRemembering Penrod's bullheadedness earlier, Sazed thought the man\nmight object. He didn't. He just nodded.\n\"What do we do then?\" Penrod asked.\n\"I'll take care of the koloss,\" Vin said. \"We'll go reclaim Keep Venture\nfirst—I'm going to need more metals, and there are plenty stored there.\nOnce the city is secure, I want you and your soldiers to put out those fires.

He could sense the fatigue in her voice.\n\"Lady Vin,\" Sazed said.

But, she was right. They could talk about his betrayal\nlater. There were other, more important tasks that had to be accomplished.\n\"I realize you probably have work for me to do,\" Sazed said, breaking the\nsilence. \"But, might I instead be excused? There is. . .a task I wish to\nperform.\"\n\"Of course, Sazed,\" Vin said. \"But first, tell me. Do you know if any of\nthe others survived?\"\n\"Clubs and Dockson are dead, my lady,\" Sazed said. \"I have not seen\ntheir bodies, but the reports were from reliable sources. You can see that\nLord Hammond is here, with us, though he has suffered a very bad wound.\"\n\"Breeze?\" she asked.\nSazed nodded to the lump that lay huddled beside the wall. \"He lives,\nthankfully.

She stood\nup straighter, her eyes becoming more alert.\nThat can't be healthy, Sazed thought with worry. How much of that has\nshe been burning?\nStep more energetic, she turned to walk toward her koloss.\n\"Lady Vin?\" Sazed asked, causing her to turn around. \"There is still an\narmy out there.\"\n\"Oh, I know,\" Vin said, turning to take one of the large, wedge like\nkoloss swords from its owner.

However, he\neventually had to move into alleyways and thoroughfares.\nHe found her body sometime near morning.\nThe city had stopped burning. The only light he had was his lantern,\nbut it was enough to reveal the strip of fluttering cloth in a snowbank. At\nfirst, Sazed thought it was just another bloodied bandage that had failed in\nits purpose. Then he saw a glimmer of orange and yellow, and he moved\nover—he no longer had the strength to rush—and reached into the snow.\nTindwyl's body cracked slightly as he rolled it out. The blood on her\nside was frozen, of course, and her eyes were iced open. Judging from the\ndirection of her flight, she had been leading her soldiers to Keep Venture.\nOh, Tindwyl, he thought, reaching down to touch her face. It was still\nsoft, but dreadfully cold. After years of being abused by the Breeders, after\nsurviving so much, she had found this. Death in a city where she hadn't\nbelonged, with a man—no, a half man—who did not deserve her.\nHe released his brassmind, and let the night's cold wash over him. He\ndidn't want to feel warm at the moment. His lantern flickered uncertainly,\nilluminating the street, shadowing the icy corpse. There, in that frozen alley\nof Luthadel, looking down at the corpse of the woman he loved, Sazed\nrealized something.\nHe didn't know what to do.\nHe tried to think of something proper to say—something proper to\nthink—but suddenly, all of his religious knowledge seemed hollow. What\nwas the use in giving her a burial? What was the value in speaking the\nprayers of a long-dead god? What good was he? The religion of Dadradah\nhadn't helped Clubs; the Survivor hadn't come to rescue the thousands of\nsoldiers who had died. What was the point?\nNone of Sazed's knowledge gave him comfort. He accepted the\nreligions he knew—believed in their value—but that didn't give him what\nhe needed. They didn't assure him that Tindwyl's spirit still lived. Instead,\nthey made him question. If so many people believed so many different\nthings, how could any one of them—or, even, anything at all—actually be\ntrue?\nThe skaa called Sazed holy, but at that moment he realized that he was\nthe most profane of men. He was a creature who knew three hundred\nreligions, yet had faith in none of them.\nSo, when his tears fell—and nearly began to freeze to his face—they\ngave him as little comfort as his religions. He moaned, leaning over the\nfrozen corpse.\nMy life, he thought, has been a sham.\nRashek is to try and lead Alendi in the wrong direction, to discourage\nhim, or otherwise foil his quest.

The koloss probably finished their rampaging and took shelter from\nthe cold. Our scouts are afraid to get too close, but they say the city is like a\ngraveyard.

Around\nhim, the army was forming up. Fifty thousand soldiers, eager at the prospect\nof taking the city. Not only was there plundering to be done, but moving\ninto Luthadel would mean roofs and walls for all of them.\n\"Perhaps,\" Janarle said, mounting.\nWouldn't that be convenient, Straff thought with a smile. All of my\nenemies dead, the city and its riches mine, and no skaa to worry about.\n\"My lord!\" someone cried.\nStraff looked up. The field between his camp and Luthadel was colored\ngray and white, the snow stained by ash. And gathering on the other side of\nthat field were koloss.\n\"Looks like they are alive after all, my lord,\" Janarle said.\n\"Indeed,\" Straff said, frowning. There were still a lot of the creatures.\nThey piled out of the western gate, not attacking immediately, instead\ngathering in a large body.\n\"Scout counts say there are fewer of them than there were,\" Janarle\nsaid after a short time. \"Perhaps two-thirds their original number, maybe a\nbit fewer. But, they are koloss. . ..\"\n\"But they're abandoning their fortifications,\" Straff said, smiling, Black\nFrayn warming his blood, making him feel like he was burning metals.\n\"And they're coming to us. Let them charge. This should be over quickly.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Janarle said, sounding a little less certain. He frowned,\nthen, pointing toward the southern section of the city. \"My. . .lord?\"\n\"What now?\"\n\"Soldiers, my lord,\" Janarle said. \"Human ones.

As she moved,\nher koloss troops hit the front ranks of Straff's army, and the real carnage\nbegan.\n\"What are they doing?\" Cett asked, hurriedly throwing on his cloak as\nhe was placed and tied into his saddle.\n\"Attacking, apparently,\" said Bahmen, one of his aides. \"Look! They're\nworking with the koloss.\"\nCett frowned, doing up his cloak clasp. \"A treaty?\"\n\"With koloss?\" Bahmen asked.\nCett shrugged. \"Who's going to win?\"\n\"No way to tell, my lord,\" the man said. \"Koloss are—\"\n\"What is this!\" Allrianne demanded, riding up the snowy incline,\naccompanied by a couple of abashed guards. Cett had, of course, ordered\nthem to keep her in the camp—but he had also, of course, expected that\nshe'd get past them eventually.\nAt least I can count on her to be slowed down by getting ready in the\nmorning, he thought with amusement. She wore one of her dresses,\nimmaculately arranged, her hair done. If a building were burning down,\nAllrianne would still pause to do her makeup before escaping.\n\"Looks like the battle has begun,\" Cett said, nodding toward the\nfighting.\n\"Outside the city?\" Allrianne asked, riding up next to him.

Then she\nbrightened. \"They're attacking Straff's position!\"\n\"Yes,\" Cett said. \"And that leaves the city—\"\n\"We have to help them, Father!\"\nCett rolled his eyes. \"You know we're going to do nothing of the sort.\nWe'll see who wins. If they're weak enough—which I hope they will be—\nwe'll attack them. I didn't bring all of my forces back with me, but maybe. .\n.\"\nHe trailed off as he noticed the look in Allrianne's eyes. He opened his\nmouth to speak, but before he could do so, she kicked her horse into\nmotion.\nHer guards cursed, dashing forward—too late—to try and grab her\nreins. Cett sat, stunned. This was a little insane, even for her. She wouldn't\ndare. . .\nShe galloped down the hill toward the battle. Then she paused, as he\nhad expected. She turned, looking back at him.\n\"If you want to protect me, Father,\" she yelled, \"you'd better charge!\"\nWith that, she turned and started galloping again, her horse throwing\nup puffs of snow.\nCett didn't move.\n\"My lord,\" Bahmen said. \"Those forces look almost evenly matched.\nFifty thousand men against a force of some twelve thousand koloss and\nabout five thousand men. If we were to add our strength to either side. . .\"\nDamn fool girl! he thought, watching Allrianne gallop away.\n\"My lord?\" Bahmen asked.\nWhy did I come to Luthadel in the first place? Was it because I really\nthought I could take the city? Without Allomancers, with my homeland in\nrevolt? Or, was it because I was looking for something? A confirmation of\nthe stories. A power like I saw on that night, when the Heir almost killed\nme.\nHow exactly did they get the koloss to fight with them, anyway?\n\"Gather our forces!\" Cett commanded. \"We're marching to the defense\nof Luthadel. And somebody send riders after that fool daughter of mine!\"\nSazed rode quietly, his horse moving slowly in the snow. Ahead of\nhim, the battle raged, but he was far enough behind it to be out of danger.\nHe'd left the city behind, where Luthadel's surviving women and elderly\nwatched from the walls. Vin had saved them from the koloss. The real\nmiracle would be to see if she could save them from the other two armies.\nSazed didn't ride into the fight. His metalminds were mostly empty,\nand his body was nearly as tired as his mind. He simply brought his horse to\na halt, its breath puffing in the cold as he sat alone on the snowy plain.\nHe didn't know how to deal with Tindwyl's death. He felt. . .hollow. He\nwished that he could just stop feeling. He wished that he could go back and\ndefend her gate, instead of his own. Why hadn't he gone in search of her\nwhen he'd heard of the northern gate's fall? She'd still been alive then. He\nmight have been able to protect her. . ."

Why bother?\nBut, the ones who had faith were right, he thought. Vin came back to\ndefend the city. I lost hope, but they never did.\nHe started his horse forward again. The sounds of battle came in the\ndistance. He tried to focus on anything but Tindwyl, but his thoughts kept\nreturning to things he had studied with her. The facts and stories became\nmore precious, for they were a link to her. A painful link, but one he\ncouldn't bear to discard.\nThe Hero of Ages was not simply to be a warrior, he thought, still\nriding slowly toward the battlefield. He was a person who united others,\nwho brought them together. A leader.\nHe knew that Vin thought she was the Hero. But Tindwyl was right: it\nwas too much of a coincidence. And, he wasn't even certain what he\nbelieved anymore. If anything.\nThe Hero of Ages was removed from the Terris people, he thought,\nwatching the koloss attack. He was not royalty himself, but came to it\neventually.\nSazed pulled his horse up, pausing in the center of the open, empty\nfield. Arrows stuck from the snow around him, and the ground was\nthoroughly trampled. In the distance, he heard a drum. He turned, watching\nas an army of men marched over a rise to the west. They flew Cett's banner.\nHe commanded the forces of the world. Kings rode to his aid.\nCett's forces joined the battle against Straff. There was a crash of metal\nagainst metal, bodies grunting, as a new front came under attack. Sazed sat\non the field between the city and the armies. Vin's forces were still\noutnumbered, but as Sazed watched, Straff's army began to pull back. It\nbroke into pieces, its members fighting without direction. Their movements\nbespoke terror.\nShe's killing their generals, he thought.\nCett was a clever man. He himself rode to battle, but he stayed near the\nback of his ranks—his infirmities requiring him to remain tied into his\nsaddle and making it difficult for him to fight. Still, by joining the battle, he\nensured that Vin would not turn her koloss on him.\nFor there was really no doubt in Sazed's mind who would win this\nconflict. Indeed, before even an hour had passed, Straff's troops began to\nsurrender in large groups. The sounds of battle died down, and Sazed\nkicked his horse forward.\nHoly First Witness, he thought. I don't know that I believe that. But,\neither way, I should be there for what happens next.\nThe koloss stopped fighting, standing silently. They parted for Sazed as\nhe rode up through their ranks. Eventually, he found Vin standing, bloodied,\nher massive koloss sword held on one shoulder. Some koloss pulled a man\nforward—a lord in rich clothing and a silvery breastplate.

Your name?\"\n\"Lord Janarle,\" said Straff's man. His leg appeared broken, and koloss\nheld him by either arm, supporting him.\n\"Straff is dead,\" Vin said. \"You control this army now.\"\nThe nobleman bowed his head. \"No, I don't. You do.\"\nVin nodded. \"On your knees,\" she said.\nThe koloss dropped Janarle. He grunted in pain, but then bowed\nforward. \"I swear my army to you,\" he whispered.\n\"No,\" Vin said sharply. \"Not to me—to the rightful heir of House\nVenture. He is your lord now.\"\nJanarle paused. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Whatever you wish. I swear\nloyalty to Straff's son, Elend Venture.\"\nThe separate groups stood in the cold. Sazed turned as Vin did, looking\nat Penrod. Vin pointed at the ground. Penrod quietly dismounted, then\nbowed himself to the ground.\n\"I swear as well,\" he said. \"I give my loyalty to Elend Venture.\"\nVin turned to Lord Cett.\n\"You expect this of me?\" the bearded man said, amused.\n\"Yes,\" Vin said quietly.\n\"And if I refuse?\" Cett asked.\n\"Then I'll kill you,\" Vin said quietly. \"You brought armies to attack my\ncity. You threatened my people. I won't slaughter your soldiers, make them\npay for what you did, but I will kill you, Cett.\"\nSilence. Sazed turned, looking back at the lines of immobile koloss,\nstanding in the bloodied snow.\n\"That is a threat, you know,\" Cett said. \"Your own Elend would never\nstand for such a thing.\"\n\"He's not here,\" Vin said.\n\"And what do you think he'd say?\" Cett asked. \"He'd tell me not to\ngive in to such a demand—the honorable Elend Venture would never give\nin simply because someone threatened his life.\"\n\"You're not the man that Elend is,\" Vin said. \"And you know it.\"\nCett paused, then smiled. \"No. No, I'm not.\" He turned to his aides.\n\"Help me down.\"\nVin watched quietly as the guards undid Cett's legs, then lifted him\ndown to the snowy ground. He bowed. \"Very well, then. I swear myself to\nElend Venture. He's welcome to my kingdom. . .assuming he can take it\nback from that damn obligator who now controls it.\"\nVin nodded, turning to Sazed. \"I need your help, Sazed.\"\n\"Whatever you command, Mistress,\" Sazed said quietly.\nVin paused. \"Please don't call me that.\"\n\"As you wish,\" Sazed said."

You will obey him as you would Elend or myself.\"\nThey each nodded in turn.\n\"But, where will you be?\" Penrod asked, looking up.\nVin sighed, suddenly looking terribly weak. \"Sleeping,\" she said, and\ndropped her sword. Then she Pushed against it, shooting backward into the\nsky, toward Luthadel.\nHe left ruin in his wake, but it was forgotten, Sazed thought, turning to\nwatch her fly.

Elend wondered. He could barely see\ntwenty feet in the mists. Trees appeared as apparitions around him as he\nwalked, their branches curling around the road. The mist almost seemed to\nlive: it moved, swirled, and blew in the cold night air. It snatched up his\npuffs of breath, as if drawing a piece of him into it.\nHe shivered and kept walking. The snow had melted patchily over the\nlast few days, leaving heaps in shadowed areas. The canal road, thankfully,\nwas mostly clear.\nHe walked with a pack over his shoulder, carrying only the necessities.\nAt Spook's suggestion, they'd traded their horses at a village several days\nback. They'd rode the creatures hard the last few days, and it was Spook's\nestimation that trying to keep them fed—and alive—for the last leg of their\ntrip to Luthadel wouldn't be worth the effort.\nBesides, whatever was going to happen at the city had likely already\noccurred. So Elend walked, alone, in the darkness. Despite the eeriness, he\nkept his word and traveled only at night. Not only was it Vin's will, but\nSpook claimed that night was safer. Few travelers braved the mists.\nTherefore, most bandits didn't bother watching roadways at night.\nSpook prowled ahead, his keen senses allowing him to detect danger\nbefore Elend blundered into it. How does that work, anyway? Elend\nwondered as he walked. Tin is supposed to make you see better. But what\ndoes it matter how far you can see, if the mists just obscure everything?\nWriters claimed that Allomancy could help a person pierce the mists,\nsomehow.

Of course, he\nhad also wondered what it felt like to feel the strength of pewter, or to fight\nwith atium. Allomancers were uncommon, even among Great Houses. Yet,\nbecause of the way Straff had treated him, Elend had always felt guilty that\nhe hadn't been one.\nBut, I ended up as king eventually, even without Allomancy, he\nthought, smiling to himself. He'd lost the throne, true. But, while they could\ntake his crown, they could not take away his accomplishments. He'd proved\nthat an Assembly could work. He'd protected the skaa, given them rights,\nand a taste of freedom they'd never forget. He'd done more than anyone\nwould have expected of him.\nSomething rustled in the mists.\nElend froze, staring out into the darkness. Sounds like leaves, he\nthought nervously. Something moving across them? Or. . .just the wind\nblowing them?\nHe decided at that moment that there was nothing more unnerving than\nstaring into the misty darkness, seeing ever-shifting silhouettes. A part of\nhim would rather face down a koloss army than stand alone, at night, in an\nunknown forest.\n\"Elend,\" someone whispered.\nElend spun. He put a hand to his chest as he saw Spook approaching.\nHe thought about chastising the boy for sneaking up on him—but, well,\nthere wasn't really any other way to approach in the mists.\n\"Did you see something?\" Spook asked quietly.\nElend shook his head. \"But I think I heard something.\"\nSpook nodded, then darted off into the mists again. Elend stood,\nuncertain whether he should continue on, or just wait. He didn't have to\ndebate for very long. Spook returned a few moments later.\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" Spook said. \"Just a mistwraith.\"\n\"What?\" Elend asked.\n\"Mistwraith,\" Spook said. \"You know. Big goopy things? Related to\nkandra? Don't tell me you haven't read about them?\"\n\"I have,\" Elend said, nervously scanning the darkness. \"But, I never\nthought I'd be out in the mists with one.\"\nSpook shrugged. \"It's probably just following our scent, hoping that\nwe'll leave some trash for it to eat. The things are harmless, mostly.\"\n\"Mostly?\" Elend asked.\n\"You probably know more about them than I do. Look, I didn't come\nback here to chat about scavengers.

I'm just thinking you should wait behind for a bit. It could be\nawkward if you wander into a scout post.\"\n\"Agreed,\" Elend said.\nSpook nodded, then took off into the mists.\nAnd Elend was alone in the darkness again.

But the thought of something crawling out there—its skeleton\nmade from random sets of bones—watching him. . .\nDon't focus on that, Elend told himself.\nHe turned his attention, instead, to the mists. Vin was right about one\nthing, at least. They were lingering longer and longer despite the sunrise.\nSome mornings, they remained a full hour after the sun came up. He could\neasily imagine the disaster that would befall the land should the mists\npersist all day. Crops would fail, animals would starve, and civilization\nwould collapse.\nCould the Deepness really be something so simple? Elend's own\nimpressions of the Deepness were seated in scholarly tradition. Some\nwriters dismissed the entire thing as a legend—a rumor used by the\nobligators to enhance their god's aura of divinity. The majority accepted the\nhistorical definition of the Deepness—a dark monster that had been slain by\nthe Lord Ruler.\nAnd yet, thinking of it as the mist made some sense. How could a\nsingle beast, no matter how dangerous, threaten an entire land? The mists,\nthough. . .they could be destructive. Kill plants. Perhaps even. . .kill people,\nas Sazed had suggested?\nHe eyed it shifting around him, playful, deceptive. Yes, he could see it\nas the Deepness. Its reputation—more frightening than a monster, more\ndangerous than an army—was one it would deserve. In fact, watching it as\nhe was, he could see it trying to play tricks on his mind. For instance, the\nmist bank directly in front of him seemed to be forming shapes. Elend\nsmiled as his mind picked out images in the mists. One almost looked like a\nperson standing there, in front of him.\nThe person stepped forward.\nElend jumped, taking a slight step backward, his foot crunching on a\nbit of ice-crusted snow. Don't be silly, he told himself. Your mind is playing\ntricks on you. There's nothing—\nThe shape in the mists took another step forward. It was indistinct,\nalmost formless, and yet it seemed real. Random movements in the mists\noutlined its face, its body, its legs.\n\"Lord Ruler!\" Elend yelped, jumping back. The thing continued to\nregard him.\nI'm going mad, he thought, hands beginning to shake. The mist figure\nstopped a few feet in front of him and then raised its right arm and pointed.\nNorth. Away from Luthadel.\nElend frowned, glancing in the direction the figure pointed. There was\nnothing but more empty mists. He turned back toward it, but it stood\nquietly, arm upraised.\nVin spoke of this thing, he remembered, forcing down his fear. She\ntried to tell me about it. And I thought she was making things up! She was\nright—just as she'd been right about the mists staying longer in the day, and\nthe possibility of the mists being the Deepness. He was beginning to\nwonder which of them was the scholar.\nThe mist figure continued to point.\n\"What?\" Elend asked, his own voice sounding haunting in the silent\nair."

Spook\napproached, his face dark and shadowed in the night. \"Elend? What were\nyou saying?\"\nElend took his hand off his sword, standing upright. He eyed the mists,\nstill not completely convinced that he wasn't seeing things. \"Nothing,\" he\nsaid.\nSpook glanced back the way he had come. \"You should come look at\nthis.\"\n\"The army?\" Elend asked, frowning.\nSpook shook his head. \"No. The refugees.\"\n\"The Keepers are dead, my lord,\" the old man said, sitting across from\nElend. He didn't have a tent, only a blanket stretched between several poles.\n\"Either dead, or captured.\"\nAnother man brought Elend a cup of warm tea, his demeanor servile.\nBoth wore the robes of stewards, and while their eyes bespoke exhaustion,\ntheir robes and hands were clean.\nOld habits, Elend thought, nodding thankfully and taking a sip of the\ntea. Terris's people might have declared themselves independent, but a\nthousand years of servitude cannot be so easily thrown off.\nThe camp was an odd place. Spook said he counted nearly a thousand\npeople in it—a nightmare of a number to care for, feed, and organize in the\ncold winter. Many were elderly, and the men were mostly stewards:\neunuchs bred for genteel service, with no experience in hunting.\n\"Tell me what happened,\" Elend said.\nThe elderly steward nodded, his head shaking. He didn't seem\nparticularly frail—actually, he had that same air of controlled dignity that\nmost stewards exhibited—but his body had a slow, chronic tremble.\n\"The Synod came out into the open, my lord, once the empire fell.\" He\naccepted a cup of his own, but Elend noticed that it was only half full—a\nprecaution that proved wise as the elderly steward's shaking nearly spilled\nits contents. \"They became our rulers. Perhaps it was not wise to reveal\nthemselves so soon.\"\nNot all Terrismen were Feruchemists; in fact, very few were. The\nKeepers—people like Sazed and Tindwyl—had been forced into hiding\nlong ago by the Lord Ruler. His paranoia that Feruchemical and Allomantic\nlines might mix—thereby potentially producing a person with his same\npowers—had led him to try and destroy all Feruchemists.\n\"I've known Keepers, friend,\" Elend said softly. \"I find it hard to\nbelieve that they could have been easily defeated. Who did this?\"\n\"Steel Inquisitors, my lord,\" the old man said."

We struggled to survive even before the\nInquisitors attacked.

Please, make yourself comfortable\nin our camp.\"\nElend nodded, rising. Spook stood a short distance away, in the mists\nnear a pair of trees. Elend joined him.\nThe people kept large fires burning in the night, as if to defy the mists.\nThe light did some good in dispelling the mists' power—and yet the light\nseemed to accentuate them as well, creating three-dimensional shadows that\nbewildered the eye. Spook leaned against the scraggly tree trunk, looking\naround at things Elend couldn't see. Elend could hear, however, some of\nwhat Spook must be inspecting. Crying children. Coughing men. Shuffling\nlivestock.\n\"It doesn't look good, does it?\" Elend said quietly.\nSpook shook his head. \"I wish they'd take down all these fires,\" he\nmuttered. \"The light hurts my eyes.\"\nElend glanced to the side. \"They aren't that bright.\"\nSpook shrugged. \"They're just wasting wood.\"\n\"Forgive them their comfort, for now. They'll have little enough of it in\nthe weeks to come.\" Elend paused, looking over at a passing squad of Terris\n\"soldiers\"—a group of men who were obviously stewards. Their posture\nwas excellent, and they walked with a smooth grace, but Elend doubted\nthey knew how to use any weapons beyond a cooking knife.\nNo, there is no army in Terris to help my people.\n\"You sent Vin back to gather our allies,\" Spook said quietly. \"To bring\nthem up to meet with us, perhaps to seek refuge in Terris.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said.\n\"We can't gather in Terris, though,\" Spook said. \"Not with the\nInquisitors up there.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said again.\nSpook was silent for a moment. \"The whole world is falling apart, El,\"\nhe finally said. \"Terris, Luthadel. . .\"\n\"Luthadel has not been destroyed,\" Elend said, looking sharply at\nSpook.\n\"The koloss—\"\n\"Vin will have found a way to stop them,\" Elend said. \"For all we\nknow, she already found the power at the Well of Ascension. We need to\nkeep going. We can, and will, rebuild whatever was lost. Then we'll worry\nabout helping Terris.\"\nSpook paused, then nodded and smiled. Elend was surprised to see\nhow much his confident words seemed to soothe the boy's concerns. Spook\nleaned back, eyeing Elend's still steaming cup of tea, and Elend handed it\nover with a mumble that he didn't like heartroot tea. Spook drank happily.\nElend, however, found matters more troubling than he'd admitted. The\nDeepness returning, ghosts in the mist, and Inquisitors making a play for\nthe Terris Dominance.

Now, let's\ngo get my damn country back!\"\n\"The empress gave us no command to do such a thing,\" Janarle said,\nsipping his tea, completely unfazed by Cett's lack of decorum. \"I,\npersonally, think that we should wait at least until the emperor returns.\"\nPenrod, the oldest of the men in the room, had enough tact to look\nsympathetic. \"I understand that you are concerned for your people, Lord\nCett. But we haven't even had a week to rebuild Luthadel. It is far too early\nto be worrying about expanding our influence. We cannot possibly authorize\nthese preparations.\"\n\"Oh, leave off, Penrod,\" Cett snapped. \"You're not in charge of us.\"\nAll three men turned to Sazed. He felt very awkward, sitting at the\nhead of the table in Keep Venture's conference chamber. Aides and\nattendants, including some of Dockson's bureaucrats, stood at the perimeter\nof the sparse room, but only the three rulers—now kings beneath Elend's\nimperial rule—sat with Sazed at the table.\n\"I think that we should not be hasty, Lord Cett,\" Sazed said.\n\"This isn't haste,\" Cett said, pounding the table again. \"I just want to\norder scout and spy reports, so that we can have information we need when\nwe invade!\"\n\"If we do invade,\" Janarle said. \"If the emperor decides to recover\nFadrex City, it won't happen until this summer, at the very earliest. We have\nfar more pressing concerns. My armies have been away from the Northern\nDominance for too long. It is basic political theory that we should stabilize\nwhat we have before we move into new territory.\"\n\"Bah!\" Cett said, waving an indifferent hand.\n\"You may send your scouts, Lord Cett,\" Sazed said. \"But they are to\nseek information only. They are to engage in no raids, no matter how\ntempting the opportunity.\"\nCett shook a bearded head. \"This is why I never bothered to play\npolitical games with the rest of the Final Empire. Nothing gets done\nbecause everyone is too busy scheming!\"\n\"There is much to be said for subtlety, Lord Cett,\" Penrod said.\n\"Patience brings the greater prize.\"\n\"Greater prize?\" Cett asked. \"What did the Central Dominance earn\nitself by waiting? You waited right up until the moment that your city fell!\nIf you hadn't been the ones with the best Mistborn. . .\"\n\"Best Mistborn, my lord?\" Sazed asked quietly. \"Did you not see her\ntake command of the koloss? Did you not see her leap across the sky like an\narrow in flight? Lady Vin isn't simply the 'best Mistborn.'\"\nThe group fell silent. I have to keep them focused on her, Sazed\nthought.

He couldn't keep the men on-topic, and he\ncouldn't do much to help them with their various problems. He could just\nkeep reminding them of Vin's power.\nThe trouble was, he didn't really want to. He was feeling something\nvery odd in himself, feelings he usually didn't have. Disconcern. Apathy.\nWhy did anything that these men talked about matter? Why did anything\nmatter, now that Tindwyl was dead?\nHe gritted his teeth, trying to force himself to focus.\n\"Very well,\" Cett said, waving a hand. \"I'll send the scouts. Has that\nfood arrived from Urteau yet, Janarle?\"\nThe younger nobleman grew uncomfortable. \"We. . .may have trouble\nwith that, my lord. It seems that an unwholesome element has been rabble-\nrousing in the city.\"\n\"No wonder you want to send troops back to the Northern\nDominance!\" Cett accused. \"You're planning to conquer your kingdom back\nand leave mine to rot!\"\n\"Urteau is much closer than your capital, Cett,\" Janarle said, turning\nback to his tea. \"It only makes sense to set me up there before we turn our\nattention westward.\"\n\"We will let the empress make that decision,\" Penrod said. He liked to\nact the mediator—and by doing so, he made himself seem above the issues.\nIn essence, he put himself in control by putting himself in between the other\ntwo.\nNot all that different from what Elend tried to do, Sazed thought, with\nour armies. The boy had more of a sense of political strategy than Tindwyl\nhad ever credited him with.\nI shouldn't think about her, he told himself, closing his eyes. Yet, it\nwas hard not to. Everything Sazed did, everything he thought, seemed\nwrong because she was gone. Lights seemed dimmer. Motivations were\nmore difficult to reach. He found that he had trouble even wanting to pay\nattention to the kings, let alone give them direction.\nIt was foolish, he knew. How long had Tindwyl been back in his life?\nOnly a few months. Long ago, he had resigned himself to the fact that he\nwould never be loved—in general—and that he certainly would never have\nher love. Not only did he lack manhood, but he was a rebel and a dissident\n—a man well outside of the Terris orthodoxy.\nSurely her love for him had been a miracle. Yet, whom did he thank for\nthat blessing, and whom did he thank for that blessing, and whom did he\ncurse for stealing her away? He knew of hundreds of gods. He would hate\nthem all, if he thought it would do any good.\nFor the sake of his own sanity, he forced himself to get distracted by\nthe kings again.\n\"Listen,\" Penrod was saying, leaning forward, arms on the tabletop. \"I\nthink we're looking at this the wrong way, gentlemen. We shouldn't be\nsquabbling, we should be happy. We are in a very unique position. In the\ntime since the Lord Ruler's empire fell, dozens—perhaps hundreds—of men\nhave tried to set themselves up as kings in various ways. The one thing they"

The one thing they\nshared, however, was that they all lacked stability.\n\"Well, it appears that we are going to be forced to work together. I am\nstarting to see this in a favorable light. I will give my allegiance to the\nVenture couple—I'll even live with Elend Venture's eccentric views of\ngovernment—if it means that I'll still be in power ten years from now.\"\nCett scratched at his beard for a moment, then nodded. \"You make a\ngood point, Penrod. Maybe the first good one I've ever heard out of you.\"\n\"But we can't continue trying to assume that we know what we are to\ndo,\" Janarle said. \"We need direction. Surviving the next ten years, I\nsuspect, is going to depend heavily on my not ending up dead on the end of\nthat Mistborn girl's knife.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Penrod said, nodding curtly. \"Master Terrisman. When can\nwe expect the empress to take command again?\"\nOnce again, all three pairs of eyes turned to Sazed.\nI don't really care, Sazed thought, then immediately felt guilty. Vin\nwas his friend. He did care. Even if it was hard to care about anything for\nhim. He looked down in shame. \"Lady Vin is suffering greatly from the\neffects of an extended pewter drag,\" he said. \"She pushed herself very hard\nthis last year, and then ended it by running all the way back to Luthadel.\nShe is in great need of rest. I think we should let her be for a time longer.\"\nThe others nodded, and returned to their discussion. Sazed's mind,\nhowever, turned to Vin. He'd understated her malady, and he was beginning\nto worry. A pewter drag drained the body, and he suspected that she'd been\nforcing herself to stay awake with the metal for months now.\nWhen a Keeper stored up wakefulness, he slept as if in a coma for a\ntime. He could only hope that the effects of such a terrible pewter drag were\nthe same, for Vin hadn't awoken a single time since her return a week\nbefore. Perhaps she'd awake soon, like a Keeper who came out of sleep.\nPerhaps it would last longer. Her koloss army waited outside the city,\ncontrolled—apparently—even though she was unconscious. But for how\nlong? Pewter dragging could kill, if the person had pushed themselves too\nhard.\nWhat would happen to the city if she never woke up?\nAsh was falling. A lot of ashfalls lately, Elend thought as he and Spook\nemerged from the trees and looked out over the Luthadel plain.\n\"See,\" Spook said quietly, pointing. \"The city gates are broken.\"\nElend frowned. \"But the koloss are camped outside the city.\" Indeed,\nStraff's army camp was also still there, right where it had been.\n\"Work crews,\" Spook said, shading his face against the sunlight to\nprotect his overly sensitive Allomancer's eyes. \"Looks like they're burying\ncorpses outside the city.\"\nElend's frown deepened. Vin. What happened to her? Is she all right?\nHe and Spook had cut across country, taking a cue from the Terrismen,"

Is she all right?\nHe and Spook had cut across country, taking a cue from the Terrismen,\nto make certain that they didn't get discovered by patrols from the city.\nIndeed, this day they'd broken their pattern, traveling a little bit during the\nday so that they could arrive at Luthadel just before nightfall. The mists\nwould soon be coming, and Elend was fatigued—both from rising early and\nfrom walking so long.\nMore than that, he was tired of not knowing what had happened to\nLuthadel. \"Can you see whose flag is set over the gates?\" he asked.\nSpook paused, apparently flaring his metals. \"Yours,\" he finally said,\nsurprised.\nElend smiled. Well, either they managed to save the city somehow, or\nthis is a very elaborate trap to capture me. \"Come on,\" he said, pointing to\na line of refugees who were being allowed back into the city—likely those\nwho had fled before, returning for food now that the danger was past. \"We'll\nmix with those and make our way in.\"\nSazed sighed quietly, shutting the door to his room. The kings were\nfinished with the day's arguments. Actually, they were starting to get along\nquite well, considering the fact that they'd all tried to conquer each other\njust a few weeks before.\nSazed knew he could take no credit for their newfound amiability,\nhowever. He had other preoccupations.\nI've seen many die, in my days, he thought, walking into the room.\nKelsier. Jadendwyl. Crenda. People I respected. I never wondered what had\nhappened to their spirits.\nHe set his candle on the table, the fragile light illuminating a few\nscattered pages, a pile of strange metal nails taken from koloss bodies, and\none manuscript. Sazed sat down at the table, fingers brushing the pages,\nremembering the days spent with Tindwyl, studying.\nMaybe this is why Vin put me in charge, he thought. She knew I'd need\nsomething to take my mind off Tindwyl.\nAnd yet, he was finding more and more that he didn't want to take his\nmind off her. Which was more potent? The pain of memory, or the pain of\nforgetting? He was a Keeper—it was his life's work to remember.\nForgetting, even in the name of personal peace, was not something that\nappealed to him.\nHe flipped through the manuscript, smiling fondly in the dark chamber.\nHe'd sent a cleaned-up, rewritten version with Vin and Elend to the north.\nThis, however, was the original. The frantically—almost desperately—\nscribbled manuscript made by two frightened scholars.\nAs he fingered the pages, the flickering candlelight revealed Tindwyl's\nfirm, yet beautiful, script. It mixed easily with paragraphs written in Sazed's\nown, more reserved hand. At times, a page would alternate between their\ndifferent hands a dozen different times.\nHe didn't realize that he was crying until he blinked, sending loose a\ntear, which hit the page. He looked down, stunned as the bit of water caused\na swirl in the ink."

He looked down, stunned as the bit of water caused\na swirl in the ink.\n\"What now, Tindwyl?\" he whispered. \"Why did we do this? You never\nbelieved in the Hero of Ages, and I never believed in anything, it appears.\nWhat was the point of all this?\"\nHe reached up and dabbed the tear with his sleeve, preserving the page\nas best he could. Despite his tiredness, he began to read, selecting a random\nparagraph. He read to remember. To think of days when he hadn't worried\nabout why they were studying. He had simply been content to do what he\nenjoyed best, with the person he had come to love most.\nWe gathered everything we could find on the Hero of Ages and the\nDeepness, he thought, reading. But so much of it seems contradictory.\nHe flipped through to a particular section, one that Tindwyl had\ninsisted that they include. It contained the several most blatant self-\ncontradictions, as declared by Tindwyl. He read them over, giving them fair\nconsideration for the first time. This was Tindwyl the scholar—a cautious\nskeptic. He fingered through the passages, reading her script.\nThe Hero of Ages will be tall of stature, one read. A man who cannot\nbe ignored by others.\nThe power must not be taken, read another. Of this, we are certain. It\nmust be held, but not used. It must be released. Tindwyl had found that\ncondition foolish, since other sections talked about the Hero using the\npower to defeat the Deepness.\nAll men are selfish, read another. The Hero is a man who can see the\nneeds of all beyond his own desires. \"If all men are selfish,\" Tindwyl had\nasked, \"then how can the Hero be selfless, as is said in other passages? And,\nindeed, how can a humble man be expected to conquer the world?\"\nSazed shook his head, smiling. At times, her objections had been very\nwell conceived—but at other times, she had just been struggling to offer\nanother opinion, no matter how much of a stretch it required. He ran his\nfingers across the page again, but paused on the first paragraph.\nTall of stature, it said. That wouldn't refer to Vin. It hadn't come from\nthe rubbing, but another book. Tindwyl had included it because the rubbing,\nthe more trustworthy source, said he'd be short. Sazed flipped through the\nbook to the complete transcription of Kwaan's iron-plate testimony,\nsearching for the passage.\nAlendi's height struck me the first time I saw him, it read. Here was a\nman who was small of stature, but who seemed to tower over others, a man\nwho demanded respect.\nSazed frowned. Before, he'd argued that there was no contradiction, for\none passage could be interpreted as referring to the Hero's presence or\ncharacter, rather than just his physical height. Now, however, Sazed paused,\nreally seeing Tindwyl's objections for the first time.\nAnd something felt wrong to him. He looked back at his book,\nscanning the contents of the page.\nThere was a place for me in the lore of the Anticipation, he read. I"

Renouncing Alendi then would have been to renounce my new\nposition, my acceptance, by the others.\nSazed's frown deepened. He traced the paragraph. Outside, it was\ngrowing dark, and a few trails of mist curled around the shutters, creeping\ninto the room before vanishing.\nHoly First Witness, he read again. How did I miss that?

Vin\nstood behind him, a dark shadow in the poorly lit room.\n\"Lady Vin! You're up!\"\n\"You shouldn't have let me sleep so long,\" she said.\n\"We tried to wake you,\" he said softly. \"You were in a coma.\"\nShe paused.\n\"Perhaps it is for the best, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said. \"The fighting is\ndone, and you pushed yourself hard these last few months. It is good for\nyou to get some rest, now that this is over.\"\nShe stepped forward, shaking her head, and Sazed could see that she\nlooked haggard, despite her days of rest. \"No, Sazed,\" she said. \"This is not\n'over.' Not by far.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Sazed asked, growing concerned.\n\"I can still hear it in my head,\" Vin said, raising a hand to her forehead.\n\"It's here. In the city.\"\n\"The Well of Ascension?\" Sazed asked. \"But, Lady Vin, I lied about\nthat. Truly and apologetically, I don't even know if there is such a thing.\"\n\"Do you believe me to be the Hero of Ages?\"\nSazed looked away. \"A few days ago, on the field outside the city, I felt\ncertain. But. . .lately. . .I don't seem to know what I believe anymore.

I can feel it. .\n.pulling me.\"\nShe glanced at the closed window, with the mists curling at the edges.\nThen, she walked over and threw the shutters open, letting in the cold\nwinter air. Vin stood, closing her eyes and letting the mists wash over her.\nShe wore only a simple shirt and trousers.\n\"I drew upon it once, Sazed,\" she said. \"Do you know that? Did I tell\nyou? When I fought the Lord Ruler. I drew power from the mists. That's\nhow I defeated him.\"\nSazed shivered, not just from the cold. From the tone in her voice, and\nthe air of her words. \"Lady Vin. . .\" he said, but wasn't sure how to\ncontinue. Drew upon the mists? What did she mean?\n\"The Well is here,\" she repeated, looking out the window, mist curling\ninto the room."

The\nrecords say he made the vast deserts around the empire, that he broke the\nland in order to preserve it. Why should we assume that things look like\nthey did when he first climbed to the Well? He created mountains. Why\ncouldn't he have flattened them?\"\nSazed felt a chill.\n\"It's what I would do,\" Vin said. \"If I knew the power would return, if I\nwanted to preserve it. I'd hide the Well. I'd let the legends remain, talking\nabout mountains to the north. Then, I would build my city around the Well\nso that I could keep an eye on it.\"\nShe turned, looking at him. \"It's here. The power waits.\"\nSazed opened his mouth to object, but could find nothing. He had no\nfaith. Who was he to argue with such things? As he paused, he heard voices\nbelow, from outside.\nVoices? he thought. At night? In the mists? Curious, he strained to hear\nwhat was being said, but they were too far away. He reached into the bag\nbeside his table. Most of his metalminds were empty; he wore only his\ncopperminds, with their stores of ancient knowledge. Inside the sack, he\nfound a small pouch. It contained the ten rings he had prepared for the\nsiege, but had never used. He pulled it open, took out one of the ten, then\ntucked the bag into his sash.\nWith this ring—a tinmind—he could tap hearing. The words below\nbecame distinct to him.\n\"The king! The king has returned!\"\nVin leaped out the window.\n\"I don't fully understand how she does it either, El,\" Ham said, walking\nwith his arm in a sling.\nElend walked through the city streets, people trailing behind him,\nspeaking in excited tones. The crowd was growing larger and larger as\npeople heard that Elend had returned. Spook eyed them uncertainly, but\nseemed to be enjoying the attention.\n\"I was out cold for the last part of the battle,\" Ham was saying. \"Only\npewter kept me alive—koloss slaughtered my team, breached the walls of\nthe keep I was defending. I got out, and found Sazed, but my mind was\ngrowing muddled by then. I remember falling unconscious outside Keep\nHasting. When I woke up, Vin had already taken the city back. I. . .\"\nThey paused. Vin stood in front of them in the city street. Quiet, dark.\nIn the mists, she almost looked like the spirit Elend had seen earlier.\n\"Vin?\" he asked in the eerie air.\n\"Elend,\" she said, rushing forward, into his arms, and the air of\nmystery was gone. She shivered as she held him. \"I'm sorry. I think I did\nsomething bad.\"\n\"Oh?\" he asked. \"What is that?\""

Sazed smiled, one of the weights on his soul\nremoved. He turned, intending to go and meet the king.\nAnd then he saw something blowing on the floor in front of him. A\nscrap of paper. He knelt down, picking it up, noticing his own handwriting\non it. Its edges were jagged from having been ripped. He frowned, walking\nover to his table, opening the book to the page with Kwaan's narrative. A\npiece was missing. The same piece as before, the one that had been ripped\nfree that time with Tindwyl. He'd almost forgotten the strange occurrence\nwith the pages all missing the same sentence.\nHe'd rewritten this page, from his metalmind, after they'd found the\ntorn sheets. Now the same bit had been torn free, the last sentence. Just to\nmake certain, he put it up next to his book. It fit perfectly. Alendi must not\nreach the Well of Ascension, it read, for he must not be allowed to take the\npower for himself. It was the exact wording Sazed had in his memory, the\nexact wording of the rubbing.\nWhy would Kwaan have worried about this? he thought, sitting down.\nHe says he knew Alendi better than anyone else. In fact, he called Alendi an\nhonorable man on several occasions.\nWhy would Kwaan be so worried about Alendi taking the power for\nhimself?\nVin walked through the mists. Elend, Ham, and Spook trailed behind\nher, the crowd dispersed by Elend's order—though some soldiers did stay\nclose to protect Elend.\nVin continued on, feeling the pulsings, the thumpings, the power that\nshook her very soul. Why couldn't the others feel it?\n\"Vin?\" Elend asked. \"Where are we going?\"\n\"Kredik Shaw,\" she said softly.\n\"But. . .why?\"\nShe just shook her head. She knew the truth, now. The Well was in the\ncity. With how strong the pulsings were growing, she might have assumed\nthat their direction would be harder to discern. But that wasn't the way it\nwas at all. Now that they were loud and full, she found it easier.\nElend glanced back at the others, and she could sense his concern. Up\nahead, Kredik Shaw loomed in the night.

This felt right. How could she explain? Together,\nthey entered the remnants of the Lord Ruler's palace.\nThe Well was here all along, Vin thought, amused. She could feel the\npulses vibrating through the building. Why hadn't she noticed it before?\nThe pulses were still too weak, then, she realized. The Well wasn't full\nyet. Now it is. And it called to her.\nShe followed the same path as before. The path she'd followed with\nKelsier, breaking into Kredik Shaw on a doomful night when she had nearly\ndied. The path she'd followed on her own, the night she had come to kill the\nLord Ruler. The tight stone corridors opened into the room shaped like an\nupside-down bowl. Elend's lantern glistened against the fine stonework and\nmurals, mostly in black and gray. The stone shack stood in the center of the\nroom, abandoned, enclosed.\n\"I think we're finally going to find your atium, Elend,\" Vin said,\nsmiling.\n\"What?\" Elend said, his voice echoing in the chamber. \"Vin, we\nsearched here. We tried everything.\"\n\"Not enough, apparently,\" Vin said, eyeing the small building-within-\na-building, but not moving toward it.\nThis is where I'd put it, she thought. It makes sense. The Lord Ruler\nwould have wanted to keep the Well close so that when the power returned,\nhe'd be able to take it.\nBut I killed him before that could happen.\nThe booming came from below. They'd torn up sections of the floor,\nbut had stopped when they'd hit solid rock. There had to be a way down.\nShe walked over, searching through the building-within-a-building, but\nfound nothing. She left, passing her confused friends, frustrated.\nThen she tried burning her metals. As always, the blue lines shot up\naround her, pointing to sources of metal.

There was nothing. . .\nVin frowned, stepping to the side. One of the inlays bore a particularly\nthick line. Too thick, in fact. She frowned, inspecting the line as it—like the\nothers—pointed from her chest directly at the stone wall. This one seemed\nto be pointing beyond the wall.\nWhat?\nShe Pulled on it. Nothing happened. So, she Pulled harder, grunting as\nshe was yanked toward the wall. She released the line, glancing about.\nThere were inlays on the floor. Deep ones.

The explosion\nof power nearly ripped her apart, but her anchor held, and duralumin-fueled\npewter kept her alive. And a section of the wall slid open, stone grinding\nagainst stone in the quiet room. Vin gasped, letting go as her metals ran out.\n\"Lord Ruler!\" Spook said. Ham was quicker, however, moving with\nthe speed of pewter and peeking into the opening. Elend stayed at her side,\ngrabbing her arm as she nearly fell.\n\"I'm fine,\" Vin said, downing a vial and restoring her metals. The\npower of the Well thumped around her. It almost seemed to shake the room.\n\"There are stairs in here,\" Ham said, poking his head back out.\nVin steadied herself and nodded to Elend, and the two of them\nfollowed Ham and Spook through the false section of the wall.\nBut, I must continue with the sparsest of detail, Kwaan's account read.\nSpace is limited. The other Worldbringers must have thought\nthemselves humble when they came to me, admitting that they had been\nwrong about Alendi. Even then, I was beginning to doubt my original\ndeclaration. But, I was prideful.\nIn the end, my pride may have doomed us all. I had never received\nmuch attention from my brethren; they thought that my work and my\ninterests were unsuitable to a Worldbringer. The couldn't see how my\nstudies, which focused on nature instead of religion, benefited the people of\nthe fourteen lands.\nAs the one who found Alendi, however, I became someone important.\nForemost among the Worldbringers. There was a place for me in the lore of\nthe Anticipation—I thought myself the Holy First Witness, the prophet\nforetold to discover the Hero of Ages. Renouncing Alendi then would have\nbeen to renounce my new position, my acceptance, by the others.\nAnd so I did not. But I do so now.\nLet it be known that I, Kwaan, Worldbringer of Terris, am a fraud.\nAlendi was never the Hero of Ages. At best, I have amplified his virtues,\ncreating a hero where there was none. At worst, I fear that I have corrupted\nall we believe.\nSazed sat at his table, reading from his book.\nSomething is not right here, he thought. He traced back a few lines,\nlooking at the words \"Holy First Witness\" again. Why did that line keep\nbothering him?\nHe sat back, sighing. Even if the prophecies did speak about the future,\nthey wouldn't be things to follow or use as guideposts. Tindwyl was right on\nthat count. His own study had proven them to be unreliable and shadowed.\nSo what was the problem?\nIt just doesn't make sense.\nBut, then again, sometimes religion didn't make literal sense. Was that\nthe reason, or was that his own bias? His growing frustration with the\nteachings he had memorized and taught, but which had betrayed him in the\nend?\nIt came down to the scrap of paper on his desk. The torn one.

Alendi\nmust not be allowed to reach the Well of Ascension. . ..\nSomeone was standing next to his desk.\nSazed gasped, stumbling back, nearly tripping over his chair. It wasn't\nactually a person. It was a shadow—formed, it seemed, from streams of\nmist. They were very faint, still trailing through the window that Vin had\nopened, but they made a person. Its head seemed turned toward the table,\ntoward the book. Or. . .perhaps the scrap of paper.\nSazed felt like running, like scrambling away in fear, but his scholar's\nmind dredged something up to fight his terror. Alendi, he thought. The one\neveryone thought was the Hero of Ages. He said he saw a thing made of\nmist following him.\nVin claimed to have seen it as well.\n\"What. . .do you want?\" he asked, trying to remain calm.\nThe spirit didn't move.\nCould it be. . .her? he wondered with shock. Many religions claimed\nthat the dead continued to walk the world, just beyond the view of mortals.\nBut this thing was too short to be Tindwyl. Sazed was sure that he would\nhave recognized her, even in such an amorphous form.\nSazed tried to gauge where it was looking. He reached out a hesitant\nhand, picking up the scrap of paper.\nThe spirit raised an arm, pointing toward the center of the city. Sazed\nfrowned.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said.\nThe spirit pointed more insistently.\n\"Write down for me what you want me to do.\"\nIt just pointed.\nSazed stood for a long moment in the room with only one candle, then\nglanced at the open book. The wind flipped its pages, showing his\nhandwriting, then Tindwyl's, then his again.\nAlendi must not be allowed to reach the Well of Ascension. He must\nnot be allowed to take the power for himself.\nPerhaps. . .perhaps Kwaan knew something that nobody else had.\nCould the power corrupt even the best of people? Could that be why he\nturned against Alendi, trying to stop him?\nThe mist spirit pointed again.\nIf the spirit tore free that sentence, perhaps it was trying to tell me\nsomething. But. . .Vin wouldn't take the power for herself. She wouldn't\ndestroy, as the Lord Ruler did, would she?\nAnd if she didn't have a choice?\nOutside, someone screamed. The yell was of pure terror, and it was\nsoon joined by others. A horrible, echoing set of sounds in a dark night.\nThere wasn't time to think. Sazed grabbed the candle, spilling wax on\nthe table in his haste, and left the room.\nThe winding set of stone stairs led downward for quite some time. Vin\nwalked down them, Elend at her side, the thumping sounding loudly in her\nears. At the bottom, the stairwell opened into. . .\nA vast chamber. Elend held his lantern high, looking down into a huge\nstone cavern. Spook was already halfway down the stone steps leading to\nthe floor. Ham was following.\n\"Lord Ruler. . .\" Elend whispered, standing at Vin's side. \"We'd have\nnever found this without tearing down the entire building!\""

Ham was following.\n\"Lord Ruler. . .\" Elend whispered, standing at Vin's side. \"We'd have\nnever found this without tearing down the entire building!\"\n\"That was probably the idea,\" Vin said. \"Kredik Shaw isn't simply a\npalace, but a capstone. Built to hide something. This. Above, those inlays\non the walls hid the cracks of the doorway, and the metal in them obscured\nthe opening mechanism from Allomantic eyes. If I hadn't had a hint. . .\"\n\"Hint?\" Elend asked, turning to her.\nVin shook her head, nodding to the steps. The two began down them.\nBelow, she heard Spook's voice ring.\n\"There's food down here!\" he yelled. \"Cans and cans of it!\"\nIndeed, they found rank upon rank of shelves sitting on the cavern\nfloor, meticulously packed as if set aside in preparation for something\nimportant. Vin and Elend reached the cavern floor as Ham chased after\nSpook, calling for him to slow down. Elend made as if to follow, but Vin\ngrabbed his arm. She was burning iron.\n\"Strong source of metal that way,\" she said, growing eager.\nElend nodded, and they rushed through the cavern, passing shelf after\nshelf. The Lord Ruler must have prepared these, she thought. But for what\npurpose?\nShe didn't care at the moment. She didn't really care about the atium\neither, but Elend's eagerness to find it was too much to ignore. They rushed\nup to the end of the cavern, where they found the source of the metal line.\nA large metal plaque hung on the wall, like the one Sazed had\ndescribed finding in the Conventical of Seran. Elend was clearly\ndisappointed when they saw it. Vin, however, stepped forward, looking\nthrough tin-enhanced eyes to see what it contained.\n\"A map?\" Elend asked. \"That's the Final Empire.\"\nIndeed, a map of the empire was carved into the metal. Luthadel was\nmarked at the center. A small circle marked another city nearby.\n\"Why is Statlin City circled?\" Elend asked, frowning.\nVin shook her head. \"This isn't what we came for,\" she said. \"There.\"\nA tunnel split off from the main cavern. \"Come on.\"\nSazed ran through the streets, not even certain what he was doing. He\nfollowed the mist spirit, which was difficult to trace in the night, as his\ncandle had long since puffed out.\nPeople screamed. Their panicked sounds gave him chills, and he itched\nto go and see what the problem was. Yet the mist spirit was demanding; it\npaused to catch his attention if it lost him. It could simply be leading him to\nhis death. And yet. . .he felt a trust for it that he could not explain.\nAllomancy? he thought. Pulling on my emotions?\nBefore he could consider that further, he stumbled across the first body.\nIt was a skaa man in simple clothing, skin stained with ash. His face was\ntwisted in a grimace of pain, and the ash on the ground was smeared from\nhis thrashings.\nSazed gasped as he pulled to a halt. He knelt, studying the body by the\ndim light of an open window nearby. This man had not died easily."

This man had not died easily.\nIt's. . .like the killings I was studying, he thought. Months ago, in the\nvillage to the south. The man there said that the mists had killed his friend.\nCaused him to fall to the ground and thrash about.\nThe spirit appeared in front of Sazed, its posture insistent. Sazed\nlooked up, frowning. \"You did this?\" he whispered.\nThe thing shook its head violently, pointing. Kredik Shaw was just\nahead. It was the direction Vin and Elend had gone earlier.\nSazed stood. Vin said she thought the Well was still in the city, he\nthought. The Deepness has come upon us, as its tendrils have been doing in\nthe far reaches of the empire for some time. Killing.\nSomething greater than we comprehend is going on.\nHe still couldn't believe that Vin going to the Well would be\ndangerous. She had read; she knew Rashek's story. She wouldn't take the\npower for herself. He was confident. But not completely certain. In fact, he\nwas no longer certain what they should do with the Well.\nI have to get to her. Stop her, talk to her, prepare her. We can't rush into\nsomething like this. If, indeed, they were going to take the power at the\nWell, they needed to think about it first and decide what the best course\nwas.\nThe mist spirit continued to point. Sazed stood and ran forward,\nignoring the horror of the screams in the night. He approached the doors of\nthe massive palace structure with its spires and spikes, then dashed inside.\nThe mist spirit remained behind, in the mists that had birthed it. Sazed\nlit his candle again with a flint, and waited. The mist spirit did not move\nforward. Still feeling an urgency, Sazed left it behind, continuing into the\ndepths of the Lord Ruler's former home. The stone walls were cold and\ndark, his candle a wan light.\nThe Well couldn't be here, he thought. It's supposed to be in the\nmountains.\nYet, so much about that time was vague. He was beginning to doubt\nthat he'd ever understood the things he'd studied.\nHe quickened his step, shading his candle with his hand, knowing\nwhere he needed to go. He'd visited the building-within-a-building, the\nplace where the Lord Ruler had once spent his time. Sazed had studied the\nplace after the empire's fall, chronicling and cataloguing. He stepped into\nthe outer room, and was halfway across it before he noticed the unfamiliar\nopening in the wall.\nA figure stood in doorway, head bowed. Sazed's candlelight reflected\nthe polished marble walls, the silvery inlayed murals, and the spikes in the\nman's eyes.\n\"Marsh?\" Sazed asked, shocked. \"Where have you been?\"\n\"What are you doing, Sazed?\" Marsh whispered.\n\"I'm going to Vin,\" he said, confused. \"She has found the Well, Marsh.\nWe have to get to her, stop her from doing anything with it until we're sure\nwhat it does.\"\nMarsh remained silent for a short time. \"You should not have come"

I wish. . .I wish I understood.\"\n\"Understood what?\" Sazed asked, voice echoing in the domed room.\nMarsh stood silently for a moment. Then he looked up, focusing his\nsightless spikeheads on Sazed.\n\"I wish I understood why I have to kill you,\" he said, then lifted a\nhand. An Allomantic Push slammed into the metal bracers on Sazed's arms,\nthrowing him backward, crashing him into the hard stone wall.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Marsh whispered.\nAlendi must not reach the Well of Ascension. . ..\n58\n\"LORD RULER!\" ELEND WHISPERED, pausing at the edge of the\nsecond cavern.\nVin joined him. They had walked in the passage for some time, leaving\nthe storage cavern far behind, walking through a natural stone tunnel. It had\nended here, at a second, slightly smaller cavern that was clogged with a\nthick, dark smoke. It didn't seep out of the cavern, as it should have, but\nbillowed and churned upon itself.\nVin stepped forward. The smoke didn't choke her, as she expected.\nThere was something oddly welcoming about it. \"Come on,\" she said,\nwalking through it across the cavern floor. \"I see light up ahead.\"\nElend joined her nervously.\nThump. Thump. Thump.\nSazed slammed into the wall. He was no Allomancer; he had no pewter\nto strengthen his body. As he collapsed to the ground, he felt a sharp pain in\nhis side, and knew he had cracked a rib. Or worse.\nMarsh strode forward, faintly illuminated by Sazed's candle, which\nburned fitfully where Sazed had dropped it.\n\"Why did you come?\" Marsh whispered as Sazed struggled to his\nknees. \"Everything was going so well.\" He watched with iron eyes as Sazed\nslowly crawled away. Then Marsh Pushed again, throwing Sazed to the\nside.\nSazed skidded across the beautiful white floor, crashing into another\nwall. His arm snapped, cracking, and his vision shuddered.\nThrough his pain, he saw Marsh stoop down and pick something up. A\nsmall pouch. It had fallen from Sazed's sash. It was filled with bits of metal;\nMarsh obviously thought it was a coin pouch.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Marsh said again, then raised a hand and Pushed the bag at\nSazed.\nThe pouch shot across the room and hit Sazed, ripping, the bits of\nmetal inside tearing into Sazed's flesh. He didn't have to look down to know\nhow badly he was injured. Oddly, he could no longer feel his pain—but he\ncould feel the blood, warm, on his stomach and legs.\nI'm. . .sorry, too, Sazed thought as the room grew dark, and he fell to\nhis knees. I've failed. . .though I know not at what. I can't even answer\nMarsh's question. I don't know why I came here."

Those weren't coins. They were rings,\nSazed. Eight of them. You took out two—eyesight and hearing. You left the\nother ones where they were.\nIn the pouch, tucked into your sash.\nSazed collapsed, death coming upon him like a cold shadow. And yet,\nthe thought rang true. Ten rings, embedded into his flesh. Touching him.\nWeight. Speed of body. Sight. Hearing. Touch. Scent. Strength. Speed of\nmind. Wakefulness.\nAnd health.\nHe tapped gold. He didn't have to be wearing the metalmind to use it—\nhe only had to be touching it. His chest stopped burning, and his vision\nsnapped back into focus. His arm straightened, the bones reknitting as he\ndrew upon several days' worth of health in a brief flash of power. He\ngasped, his mind recovering from its near death, but the goldmind restored\na crisp clarity to his thoughts.\nThe flesh healed around the metal. Sazed stood, pulling the empty bag\nfrom where it stuck from his skin, leaving the rings inside of him. He\ndropped it to the ground, the wound sealing, draining the last of the power\nfrom the goldmind. Marsh stopped at the mouth of the doorway, turning in\nsurprise. Sazed's arm still throbbed, probably cracked, and his ribs were\nbruised. Such a short burst of health could only do so much.\nBut he was alive.\n\"You have betrayed us, Marsh,\" Sazed said. \"I did not realize those\nspikes stole a man's soul, as well as his eyes.\"\n\"You cannot fight me,\" Marsh replied quietly, his voice echoing in the\ndark room. \"You are no warrior.\"\nSazed smiled, feeling the small metalminds within him give him\npower. \"Neither, I think, are you.\"\nI am involved in something that is far over my head, Elend thought as\nthey passed through the strange, smoke-filled cavern.

A thing of gods, a thing beyond the logic of scholars and\nphilosophers?\nThat was terrifying.\nThey finally approached the other side of the smoky cavern. Here,\nthere appeared to be a final chamber, one much smaller than the first two.\nAs they stepped into it, Elend noticed something immediately: this room\nwas man-made. Or, at least, it had the feel of something man-made.\nStalactites formed pillars through the low-ceilinged room, and they were\nspaced far too evenly to be random. Yet, at the same time, they looked as if\nthey had grown naturally, and showed no signs of being worked.\nThe air seemed warmer inside—and, thankfully, they passed out of the\nsmoke as they entered. A low light came from something on the far side of\nthe chamber, though Elend couldn't distinguish the source. It didn't look like\ntorchlight. It was the wrong color, and it shimmered rather than flickered.\nVin wrapped an arm around him, staring toward the back of the\nchamber, suddenly seeming apprehensive.\n\"Where is that light coming from?\" Elend asked, frowning.\n\"A pool,\" Vin said quietly, her eyes far keener than his. \"A glowing\nwhite pool.\"\nElend frowned. But, the two of them didn't move. Vin seemed hesitant.\n\"What?\" he asked.\nShe pulled against him. \"That's the Well of Ascension. I can feel it\ninside of my head. Beating.\"\nElend forced a smile, feeling a surreal sense of displacement. \"That's\nwhat we came for, then.\"\n\"What if I don't know what to do?\" Vin asked quietly. \"What if I take\nthe power, but I don't know how to use it? What if I. . .become like the Lord\nRuler?\"\nElend looked down at her, arms wrapped around him, and his fear\nlessened a bit. He loved her. The situation they faced, it couldn't easily fit\ninto his logical world. But Vin had never really needed logic. And he didn't\nneed it either, if he trusted her.\nHe took her head in his hands, rotating it up to look at him. \"Your eyes\nare beautiful.\"\nShe frowned. \"What—\"\n\"And,\" Elend continued, \"part of the beauty in them comes from your\nsincerity. You won't become the Lord Ruler, Vin. You'll know what to do\nwith that power. I trust you.\"\nShe smiled hesitantly, then nodded. However, she didn't move forward\ninto the cavern. Instead, she pointed at something over Elend's shoulder.\n\"What's that?\"\nElend turned, noticing a ledge on the back wall of the small room. It\ngrew straight out of the rock just beside the doorway they had entered. Vin\napproached the ledge, and Elend followed behind her, noticing the shards\nthat lay upon it.\n\"It looks like broken pottery,\" Elend said. There were several patches\nof it, and more of it was scattered on the floor beneath the ledge.\nVin picked up a piece, but there didn't seem to be anything distinctive\nabout it. She looked at Elend, who was fishing through the pottery pieces."

It was a disklike piece of fired clay with a single bead of some metal\nat the center.\n\"Atium?\" she asked.\n\"It looks like the wrong color,\" he said, frowning.\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\"Maybe we'll find the answers over there,\" Elend said, turning and\nlooking down the rows of pillars toward the light. Vin nodded, and they\nwalked forward.\nMarsh immediately tried to Push Sazed away by the metal bracers on\nhis arms. Sazed was ready, however, and he tapped his ring ironmind—\ndrawing forth the weight he had stored within it. His body grew denser, and\nhe felt its weight pulling him down, his fists feeling like balls of iron on the\nends of lead arms.\nMarsh immediately lurched away, thrown violently backward by his\nown Push. He slammed into the back wall, a cry of surprise escaping his\nlips. It echoed in the small, domed room.\nShadows danced in the room as the candle grew weaker. Sazed tapped\nsight, enhancing his vision, and released iron as he dashed toward the\naddled Inquisitor. Marsh, however, recovered quickly. He reached out,\nPulling an unlit lamp off the wall. It zipped through the air, flying toward\nMarsh.\nSazed tapped zinc. He felt something like a twisted hybrid of an\nAllomancer and a Feruchemist, his sources of metal embedded within him.\nThe gold had healed his insides, made him whole, but the rings still\nremained within his flesh. This was what the Lord Ruler had done, keeping\nhis metalminds inside of him, piercing his flesh so that they would be\nharder to steal.\nThat had always seemed morbid to Sazed. Now, he saw how useful it\ncould be. His thoughts sped up, and he quickly saw the trajectory of the\nlamp. Marsh would be able to use it as a weapon against him. So Sazed\ntapped steel. Allomancy and Feruchemy had one fundamental difference:\nAllomancy drew its powers from the metals themselves, and so the amount\nof power was limited; in Feruchemy, one could compound an attribute\nmany times, drawing out months' worth of power in a few minutes.\nSteel stored physical speed. Sazed zipped across the room, air rushing\nin his ears as he shot past the open doorway. He snatched the lamp out of\nthe air, then tapped iron hard—increasing his weight manyfold—and tapped\npewter to give himself massive strength.\nMarsh didn't have time to react. He was now Pulling on a lamp held in\nSazed's inhumanly strong, inhumanly heavy, hand. Again, Marsh was\nyanked by his own Allomancy. The Pull threw him across the room, directly\ntoward Sazed.\nSazed turned, slamming the lamp into Marsh's face. The metal bent in\nhis hand, and the force threw Marsh backward.

Marsh, however, threw an arm up and Pushed.\nSazed skidded back a few feet before he was able to tap the ironmind again,\nincreasing his weight.\nMarsh grunted, his Push forcing him back against the wall. It also,\nhowever, kept Sazed at bay. Sazed struggled to step forward, but the\npressure of Marsh's Push—along with his own bulky, weighed-down body\n—made walking difficult. The two strained for a moment, Pushing against\neach other in the darkening light. The room's inlays sparkled, quiet murals\nwatching them, open doorway leading down to the Well just to the side.\n\"Why, Marsh?\" Sazed whispered.\n\"I don't know,\" Marsh said, his voice coming out in a growl.\nWith a flash of power, Sazed released his ironmind and instead tapped\nsteel, increasing his speed again. He dropped the lamp, ducking to the side,\nmoving more quickly than Marsh could track. The lamp was forced\nbackward, but then fell to the ground as Marsh let go of his Push, jumping\nforward, obviously trying to keep from being trapped against the wall.\nBut Sazed was faster. He spun, raising a hand to try to pull out Marsh's\nlinchpin spike—the one in between his shoulder blades, pounded down\nlengthwise into the back. Pulling this one spike would kill an Inquisitor; it\nwas the weakness the Lord Ruler had built into them.\nSazed skidded around Marsh to attack from behind. The spike in\nMarsh's right eye protruded several extra inches out the back of his skull,\nand it dribbled blood.\nSazed's steelmind ran out.\nThe rings had never been intended to last long, and his two extreme\nbursts had drained this one in seconds. He slowed with a dreadful lurch, but\nhis arm was still raised, and he still had the strength of ten men. He could\nsee the bulge of the linchpin spike underneath Marsh's robe. If he could just\n—\nMarsh spun, then dexterously knocked aside Sazed's hand.

He hit the hard steel ground with a grunt of pain, and rolled.\nMarsh loomed in the dark room. The candle flickered.\n\"You were wrong, Sazed,\" Marsh said quietly. \"Once, I was not a\nwarrior, but that has changed. You spent the last two years teaching, but I\nspent them killing. Killing so many people. . ..\"\nMarsh stepped forward, and Sazed coughed, trying to get his bruised\nbody to move. He worried that he'd rebroken his arm. He tapped zinc again,\nspeeding up his thoughts, but that didn't help his body move. He could only\nwatch—more fully aware of his predicament and unable to do a thing to\nstop it—as Marsh picked up the fallen lamp.\nThe candle went out."

Elend knelt quietly beside it, but\nVin just stood. Staring at the glittering waters.\nThey were gathered in a small depression in the rock, and they looked\nthick—like metal. A silvery white, glowing liquid metal. The Well was only\na few feet across, but its power loomed in her mind.\nVin was so enraptured by the beautiful pool, in fact, that she didn't\nnotice the mist spirit until Elend's grip tightened on her arm. She looked up,\nnoticing the spirit standing before them. It seemed to have its head bowed,\nbut as she turned, its shadowy form stood up straighter.\nShe'd never seen the creature outside of the mist. It still wasn't\ncompletely. . .whole. Mist puffed from its body, flowing downward,\ncreating its amorphous form. A persistent pattern.\nVin hissed quietly, pulling out a dagger.\n\"Wait!\" Elend said, standing.\nShe frowned, shooting him a glance.\n\"I don't think it's dangerous, Vin,\" he said, stepping away from her,\ntoward the spirit.\n\"Elend, no!\" she said, but he gently shook her free.\n\"It visited me while you were gone, Vin,\" he explained. \"It didn't hurt\nme. It just. . .seemed like it wanted me to know something.\" He smiled, still\nwearing his nondescript cloak and traveling clothing, and walked slowly up\nto the mist spirit. \"What is it you want?\"\nThe mist spirit stood immobile for a moment, then it raised its arm.\nSomething flashed, reflecting the pool's light.\n\"No!\" Vin screamed, dashing forward as the spirit slashed across\nElend's gut. Elend grunted in pain, then stumbled back.\n\"Elend!\" Vin said, scrambling to Elend's side as he slipped and fell to\nthe ground. The spirit backed away, dripping blood from somewhere within\nits deceptively incorporeal form. Elend's blood.\nElend lay, shocked, eyes wide. Vin flared pewter and ripped open the\nfront of his jacket, exposing the wound. The spirit had cut deeply into his\nstomach, slashing the gut open.\n\"No. . .no. . .no. . .\" Vin said, mind growing numb, Elend's blood on\nher hands.\nThe wound was very bad. Deadly.\nHam dropped the broken cane, one arm still in a sling. The beefy Thug\nlooked incredibly pleased with himself as he stepped over Marsh's body and\nreached his good hand toward Sazed.\n\"Didn't expect to find you here, Saze,\" the Thug said.\nDazed, Sazed took the hand and climbed to his feet.

Yet Sazed was too addled to care.\nHe picked up his candle, lit it from Ham's lantern, then made his way\ntoward the stairs, forcing himself onward.\nHe had to keep going. He had to get to Vin.\nVin cradled Elend in her arms, her cloak forming a hasty—and\ndreadfully inadequate—bandage around his torso.\n\"I love you,\" she whispered, tears warm on her cold cheeks. \"Elend, I\nlove you. I love you. . .\"\nLove wouldn't be enough. He was trembling, eyes staring upward,\nbarely able to focus. He gasped, and blood bubbled in his spittle.\nShe turned to the side, numbly realizing where she knelt. The pool\nglowed beside her, just inches from where Elend had fallen. Some of his\nblood had dribbled into the pool, though it didn't mix with the liquid metal.\nI can save him, she realized. The power of creation rests just inches\nfrom my fingers.

It resisted her touch, but her foot began to\nsink, slowly. She stepped forward, moving into the center of the pool,\nwaiting as she sank. Within seconds, the pool was up to her chest, the\nglowing liquid all around her.\nShe took a breath, then leaned her head back, looking up as the pool\nabsorbed her, covering her face.\nSazed stumbled down the stairs, candle held in quivering fingers. Ham\nwas calling after him. He passed a confused Spook on the landing below,\nand ignored the boy's questions.\nHowever, as he began to make his way down to the cavern floor, he\nslowed. A small tremor ran through the rock.\nSomehow, he knew that he was too late.\nThe power came upon her suddenly.\nShe felt the liquid pressing against her, creeping into her body,\ncrawling, forcing its way through the pores and openings in her skin. She\nopened her mouth to scream, and it rushed in that way too, choking her,\ngagging her.\nWith a sudden flare, her earlobe began to hurt. She cried out, pulling\nher earring free, dropping it into the depths. She pulled off her sash, letting\nit—and her Allomantic vials—go as well, removing the only metals on her\nperson.\nThen she started to burn.

Her skin flared, her muscles flamed, and her very bones seemed\non fire. She gasped, and realized the metal was gone from her throat.\nShe was glowing. She felt the power within, as if it were trying to\nburst back out. It was like the strength she gained by burning pewter, but\namazingly more potent. It was a force of incredible capacity. It would have\nbeen beyond her ability to understand, but it expanded her mind, forcing her\nto grow and comprehend what she now possessed.\nShe could remake the world. She could push back the mists. She could\nfeed millions with the wave of her hand, punish the evil, protect the weak.\nShe was in awe of herself. The cavern was as if translucent around her, and\nshe saw the entire world spreading, a magnificent sphere upon which life\ncould exist only in a small little area at the poles. She could fix that. She\ncould make things better. She could. . .\nShe could save Elend.\nShe glanced down and saw him dying. She immediately understood\nwhat was wrong with him.

Kindly.\n\"I have to save him!\" she cried.\nYou know what you must do.\nAnd she did know. She saw it happen—she saw, as if in a vision,\nRashek when he'd taken the power for himself. She saw the disasters he\ncreated.\nIt was all or nothing—like Allomancy, in a way. If she took the power,\nshe would have to burn it away in a few moments. Remaking things as she\npleased, but only for a brief time.\nOr. . .she could give it up.\nI must defeat the Deepness, the Voice said.\nShe saw that, too. Outside the palace, in the city, across the land.\nPeople in the mists, shaking, falling. Many stayed indoors, thankfully. The\ntraditions of the skaa were still strong within them.\nSome were out, however. Those who trusted in Kelsier's words that the\nmists could not hurt them. But now the mists could. They had changed,\nbringing death.\nThis was the Deepness. Mists that killed. Mists that were slowly\ncovering the entire land. The deaths were sporadic; Vin saw many falling\ndead, but saw others simply falling sick, and still others going about in the\nmists as if nothing were wrong.\nIt will get worse, the Voice said quietly. It will kill and destroy. And, if\nyou try to stop it yourself, you will ruin the world, as Rashek did before\nyou.\n\"Elend. . .\" she whispered. She turned toward him, bleeding on the\nfloor.\nAt that moment, she remembered something. Something Sazed had\nsaid. You must love him enough to trust his wishes, he had told her. It isn't\nlove unless you learn to respect him—not what you assume is best, but\nwhat he actually wants. . .."

The thing was gone, and the\nthumping in her mind was finally quiet. She sniffled, arms around Elend,\nholding him as he gasped his final few breaths. She'd screamed for help,\ncalling for Ham and Spook, but had gotten no response. They were too far\naway.\nShe felt cold. Empty. After holding that much power, then having it\nripped from her, she felt like she was nothing. And, once Elend died, she\nwould be.\nWhat would be the point? she thought. Life doesn't mean anything.\nI've betrayed Elend. I've betrayed the world.\nShe wasn't certain what had happened, but somehow she'd made a\nhorrible, horrible mistake. The worst part was, she had tried so hard to do\nwhat was right, even if it hurt.\nSomething loomed above her. She looked up at the mist spirit, but\ncouldn't even really feel rage. She was having trouble feeling anything at\nthe moment.\nThe spirit raised an arm, pointing.\n\"It's over,\" she whispered.\nIt pointed more demandingly.\n\"I won't get to them in time,\" she said. \"Besides, I saw how bad the cut\nwas. Saw it with the power. There's nothing any of them could do, not even\nSazed. So, you should be pleased. You got what you wanted. . .\" She trailed\noff.

The disk Elend had taken from the shelf in the back\nof the room, and had been holding in his hand. It had broken when he'd\ncollapsed.\nThe mist spirit pointed urgently. Vin approached and bent over, fingers\nfinding the small nugget of metal that had been at the disk's center.\n\"What is it?\" she whispered.\nThe mist spirit turned and drifted back to Elend. Vin walked up quietly.\nHe was still alive. He seemed to be getting weaker, and was trembling\nless. Eerily, as he grew closer to death, he actually seemed a bit more in\ncontrol. He looked at her as she knelt, and she could see his lips moving.\n\"Vin. . .\" he whispered.\nShe knelt beside him, looked at the bead of metal, then looked up at\nthe spirit. It stood motionless. She rolled the bead between her fingers, then\nmoved to eat it.\nThe spirit moved urgently, shaking its hands. Vin paused, and the spirit\npointed at Elend.\nWhat? she thought. However, she wasn't really in a state to think. She\nheld the nugget up to Elend. \"Elend,\" she whispered, leaning close. \"You\nmust swallow this.\"\nShe wasn't certain if he understood her or not, though he did appear to\nnod. She placed the bit of metal in his mouth. His lips moved, but he started\nto choke.\nI have to get him something to wash it down, she thought. The only\nthing she had was one of her metal vials. She reached into the empty well,\nretrieving her earring and her sash. She pulled free a vial, then poured the\nliquid into his mouth.\nElend continued to cough weakly, but the liquid did its work well,\nwashing down the bead of metal. Vin knelt, feeling so powerless, a\ndepressing contrast to how she had been just moments before. Elend closed\nhis eyes.\nThen, oddly, the color seemed to return to his cheeks. Vin knelt,\nconfused, watching him.

He'd left a note. He couldn't stay in Luthadel. Not at the\nmoment.\nThe mists still killed. They struck random people who went out at\nnight, with no discernible pattern.

He half\nexpected to be confronted by one Inquisitor or another. Perhaps Marsh\nwould try to kill him again. By the time he and Ham had returned from the\nstorage cavern beneath Luthadel, Marsh had vanished again. His work had,\napparently, been done. He'd stalled Sazed long enough to keep him from\nstopping Vin.\nSazed made his way down the steps, through the torture chamber, and\nfinally into the small rock room he'd visited on his first trip to the\nConventical, so many weeks before. He dropped his pack to the ground,\nworking it open with tired fingers, then looked up at the large steel plate.\nKwaan's final words stared back at him. Sazed knelt, pulling a\ncarefully tied portfolio from his pack. He undid the string, and then\nremoved his original rubbing, made in this very room months before. He\nrecognized his fingerprints on the thin paper, knew the strokes of the\ncharcoal to be his own. He recognized the smudges he had made.\nWith growing nervousness, he held the rubbing up and slapped it\nagainst the steel plate on the wall.\nAnd the two did not match.\nSazed stepped back, uncertain what to think now that his suspicions\nhad been confirmed. The rubbing slipped limply from his fingers, and his\neyes found the sentence at the end of the plate. The last sentence, the one\nthat the mist spirit had ripped free time and time again. The original one on\nthe steel plate was different from the one Sazed had written and studied.\nAlendi must not reach the Well of Ascension, Kwaan's ancient words\nread, for he must not be allowed to release the thing that is imprisoned\nthere.\nSazed sat down quietly. It was all a lie, he thought numbly. The\nreligion of the Terris people. . .the thing the Keepers spent millennia\nsearching for, trying to understand, was a lie. The so-called prophecies, the\nHero of Ages. . .a fabrication.\nA trick.\nWhat better way for such a creature to gain freedom? Men would die\nin the name of prophecies. They wanted to believe, to hope. If someone—\nsomething—could harness that energy, twist it, what amazing things could\nbe accomplished. . ..\nSazed looked up, reading the words on the wall, reading the second\nhalf once again. It contained paragraphs that were different from his\nrubbing.\nOr, rather, his rubbing had been changed somehow. Changed to reflect\nwhat the thing had wished Sazed to read. I write these words in steel,\nKwaan's first words said, for anything not set in metal cannot be trusted.\nSazed shook his head. They should have paid attention to that\nsentence. Everything he had studied after that had, apparently, been a lie.\nHe looked up at the plate, scanning its contents, coming to the final section.\nAnd so, they read, I come to the focus of my argument.

I apologize.\nEven forcing my words into steel, sitting and scratching in this frozen cave,\nI am prone to ramble.\nThis is the problem. Though I believed in Alendi at\nfirst, I later became suspicious. It seemed that he fit the\nsigns, true. But, well, how can I explain this?\nCould it be that he fit them too well?\nI know your argument. We speak of the\nAnticipation, of things foretold, of promises made by\nour greatest prophets of old. Of course the Hero of Ages\nwill fit the prophecies. He will fit them perfectly. That's\nthe idea.\nAnd yet. . .something about all this seems so\nconvenient. It feels almost as if we constructed a hero to\nfit our prophecies, rather than allowing one to arise\nnaturally. This was the worry I had, the thing that\nshould have given me pause when my brethren came to\nme, finally willing to believe.\nAfter that, I began to see other problems. Some of\nyou may know of my fabled memory. It is true; I need\nnot a Feruchemist's metalmind to memorize a sheet of\nwords in an instant. And I tell you, call me daft, but the\nwords of the prophecies are changing.\nThe alterations are slight. Clever, even. A word\nhere, a slight twist there. But the words on the pages are\ndifferent from the ones in my memory. The other\nWorldbringers scoff at me, for they have their\nmetalminds to prove to them that the books and\nprophecies have not changed.\nAnd so, this is the great declaration I must make.\nThere is something—some force—that wants us to\nbelieve that the Hero of Ages has come, and that he\nmust travel to the Well of Ascension. Something is\nmaking the prophecies change so that they refer to\nAlendi more perfectly.\nAnd whatever this power is, it can change words\nwithin a Feruchemist's metalmind.\nThe others call me mad. As I have said, that may\nbe true. But must not even a madman rely on his own\nmind, his own experience, rather than that of others? I\nknow what I have memorized. I know what is now\nrepeated by the other Worldbringers. The two are not\nthe same.\nI sense a craftiness behind these changes, a\nmanipulation subtle and brilliant. I have spent the last\ntwo years in exile, trying to decipher what the\nalterations could mean. I have come to only one\nconclusion. Something has taken control of our religion,\nsomething nefarious, something that cannot be trusted.\nIt misleads, and it shadows. It uses Alendi to destroy,\nleading him along a path of death and sorrow. It is\npulling him toward the Well of Ascension, where the\nmillennial power has gathered. I can only guess that it\nsent the Deepness as a method of making mankind\nmore desperate, of pushing us to do as it wills.\nThe prophecies have changed.

And yet, the new version seems to\nmake it a moral imperative. The texts now outline a\nterrible consequence if the Hero of Ages takes the\npower for himself.\nAlendi believes as they do. He is a good man—\ndespite it all, he is a good man. A sacrificing man. In\ntruth, all of his actions—all of the deaths, destructions,\nand pains that he has caused—have hurt him deeply. All\nof these things were, in truth, a kind of sacrifice for\nhim. He is accustomed to giving up his own will for the\ncommon good, as he sees it.\nI have no doubt that if Alendi reaches the Well of\nAscension, he will take the power and then—in the\nname of the presumed greater good—will give it up.\nGive it away to this same force that has changed the\ntexts. Give it up to this force of destruction that has\nbrought him to war, that has tempted him to kill, that\nhas craftily led him to the north.\nThis thing wants the power held in the Well, and it\nhas raped our religion's holiest tenets in order to get it.\nAnd so, I have made one final gamble. My pleas,\nmy teachings, my objections, and even my treasons\nwere all ineffectual. Alendi has other counselors now,\nones who tell him what he wants to hear.\nI have a young nephew, one Rashek.

Rashek is to try and lead Alendi in the wrong\ndirection, to dissuade him, discourage him, or otherwise\nfoil his quest.

He was\nkilled during the fight against the Lord Ruler.\nYOMEN, LORD: An obligator in Urteau who was politically opposed\nto Cett.\nSUMMARY OF BOOK ONE\nMistborn: The Final Empire introduced the land of the Final Empire,\nruled over by a powerful immortal known as the Lord Ruler. A thousand\nyears before, the Lord Ruler took the power at the Well of Ascension and\nsupposedly defeated a powerful force or creature known only as the\nDeepness.\nThe Lord Ruler conquered the known world and founded the Final\nEmpire. He ruled for a thousand years, stamping out all remnants of the\nindividual kingdoms, cultures, religions, and languages that used to exist in\nhis land. In their place he set up his own system. Certain peoples were\ndubbed \"skaa,\" a word that meant something akin to \"slave\" or \"peasant.\"\nOther peoples were dubbed nobility, and most of these were descendants of\nthose people who had supported the Lord Ruler during his years of\nconquest. The Lord Ruler had supposedly given them the power of\nAllomancy in order to gain powerful assassins and warriors who had minds\nthat could think, as opposed to the brutish koloss, and had used them well in\nconquering and maintaining his empire.\nSkaa and nobility were forbidden to interbreed, and the nobility were\nsomehow given the power of Allomancy. During the thousand years of the\nLord Ruler's reign, many rebellions occurred among the skaa, but none\nwere successful.\nFinally, a half-breed Mistborn known as Kelsier decided to challenge\nthe Lord Ruler. Once the most famous of gentleman thieves in the Final\nEmpire, Kelsier had been known for his daring schemes. Those eventually\nended with his capture, however, and he had been sent to the Lord Ruler's\ndeath camp at the Pits of Hathsin, the secret source of atium.\nIt was said that nobody ever escaped the Pits of Hathsin alive—but\nKelsier did just that. He gained his powers as a Mistborn during that time,\nand managed to free himself, earning the title the Survivor of Hathsin. At\nthis point, he turned from his selfish ways and decided to try his most\ndaring plan yet: the overthrow of the Final Empire.\nHe recruited a team of thieves, mostly half-breed Mistings, to help him\nachieve his goal. During this time, he also recruited a young half-breed\nMistborn girl named Vin. Vin was unaware of her powers, and Kelsier\nbrought her into the crew to train her, theoretically to have someone to\nwhom he could pass his legacy.\nKelsier's crew slowly gathered an underground army of skaa rebels.\nThe crew began to fear that Kelsier was setting himself up to be another\nLord Ruler. He sought to make himself a legend among the skaa, becoming\nalmost a religious figure to them. Meanwhile, Vin—who had been raised on\nthe streets by a cruel brother—was growing to trust people for the first time\nin her life. As this happened, Vin began to believe in Kelsier and his\npurpose."

As this happened, Vin began to believe in Kelsier and his\npurpose.\nDuring the process of working on their plan, Vin was used as a spy\namong the nobility, and was trained to infiltrate their balls and parties\nplaying the part of \"Valette Renoux,\" a young noblewoman from the\ncountryside. During the first of these balls, she met Elend Venture, a young,\nidealistic nobleman. He eventually showed her that not all noblemen were\ndeserving of their poor reputation, and the two became enamored of each\nother, despite Kelsier's best efforts.\nThe crew also discovered a journal, apparently written by the Lord\nRuler himself during the days before the Ascension. This book painted a\ndifferent picture of the tyrant; it depicted a melancholy, tired man who was\ntrying his best to protect the people against the Deepness, despite the fact\nthat he didn't really understand it.\nIn the end, it was revealed that Kelsier's plan had been much more\nbroad than simple use of the army to overthrow the empire. He'd partially\nspent so much effort on raising troops so that he would have an excuse to\nspread rumors about himself. He also used it to train his crew in the arts of\nleadership and persuasion. The true extent of his plan was revealed when he\nsacrificed his life in a very visible way, making himself a martyr to the skaa\nand finally convincing them to rise up and overthrow the Lord Ruler.\nOne of Kelsier's crewmembers—a man who had been playing the part\nof \"Lord Renoux,\" Valette's uncle—turned out to be a kandra named\nOreSeur. OreSeur took on Kelsier's form, then went about spreading rumors\nthat Kelsier had returned from the grave, inspiring the skaa. After this, he\nbecame Contractually bound to Vin, and was charged with watching over\nher after Kelsier's death.\nVin was the one who in fact killed the Lord Ruler. She discovered that\nhe wasn't actually a god, or even immortal—he had simply found a way to\nextend his life and his power by making use of both Allomancy and\nFeruchemy at the same time. He wasn't the hero from the logbook—but,\ninstead, was that man's servant, a Feruchemist of some great power. Still, he\nwas much stronger in Allomancy than Vin. While she was fighting him, she\ndrew upon the mists somehow, burning them in place of metals. She still\ndoesn't know why or how this happened. With that power—and with the\nknowledge of his true nature—she was able to defeat and kill him.\nThe Final Empire was thrown into chaos. Elend Venture took control\nof Luthadel, the capital, and put Kelsier's crew in prime governmental\npositions.\nOne year has passed.\nA WORD FROM BRANDON SANDERSON\nIf you've enjoyed The Well of Ascension—and I certainly hope you\nhave I—you don't have long to wait for the conclusion of Vin and Elend's\nstory. The Hero of Ages is set for publication in October.
