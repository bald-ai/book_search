He had given up on trying to break free. Three years. Three\nyears as an Inquisitor, three years imprisoned in his own thoughts. Those years had proven that there was\nno escape. Even now, his mind clouded.\nAnd then It took control. The world seemed to vibrate around him; then suddenly he could see clearly.\nWhy had he struggled? Why had he worried? All was as it should be.\nHe stepped forward. Though he could no longer see as normal men did—after all, he had large steel\nspikes driven point-first through his eyes—he could sense the room around him. The spikes protruded\nfrom the back of his skull; if he reached up to touch the back of his head, he could feel the sharp points.\nThere was no blood.\nThe spikes gave him power. Everything was outlined in fine blue Allomantic lines, highlighting the\nworld. The room was of modest size, and several companions—also outlined in blue, the Allomantic lines\npointing at the metals contained in their very blood—stood with Marsh. Each one had spikes through his\neyes.\nEach one, that is, except for the man tied to the table in front of him. Marsh smiled, taking a spike off\nof the table beside him, then hefting it. His prisoner wore no gag. That would have stopped the screams.\n\"Please,\" the prisoner whispered, trembling. Even a Terrisman steward would break down when\nconfronted by his own violent death. The man struggled weakly. He was in a very awkward position, as\nhe had been tied to the table on top of another person. The table had been designed that way, with\ndepressions to allow for the body underneath.\n\"What is it you want?\" the Terrisman asked. \"I can tell you no more about the Synod!\"\nMarsh fingered the brass spike, feeling its tip. There was work to do, but he hesitated, relishing the\npain and terror in the man's voice. Hesitated so that he could . . ."

Hesitated so that he could . . .\nMarsh grabbed control of his own mind. The room's scents lost their sweetness, and instead reeked\nwith the stench of blood and death. His joy turned to horror. His prisoner was a Keeper of Terris—a\nman who had worked his entire life for the good of others. Killing him would be not only a crime, but a\ntragedy. Marsh tried to take command, tried to force his arm up and around to grab the linchpin spike\nfrom his back—its removal would kill him.\nYet, It was too strong. The force. Somehow, it had control over Marsh—and it needed him and the\nother Inquisitors to be its hands. It was free—Marsh could still feel it exulting in that—but something kept\nit from affecting the world too much by itself. An opposition. A force that lay over the land like a shield.\nIt was not yet complete. It needed more. Something else . . . something hidden. And Marsh would\nfind that something, bring it to his master. The master that Vin had freed. The entity that had been\nimprisoned within the Well of Ascension.\nIt called itself Ruin.\nMarsh smiled as his prisoner began to cry; then he stepped forward, raising the spike in his hand. He\nplaced it against the whimpering man's chest. The spike would need to pierce the man's body, passing\nthrough the heart, then be driven into the body of the Inquisitor tied below. Hemalurgy was a messy art.\nThat was why it was so much fun. Marsh picked up a mallet and began to pound.\nPART ONE\nLEGACY OF THE SURVIVOR\nI am, unfortunately, the Hero of Ages.\n1\nFATREN SQUINTED UP AT THE RED SUN, which hid behind its perpetual screen of dark haze.\nBlack ash fell lightly from the sky, as it did most days lately. The thick flakes fell straight, the air stagnant\nand hot, without even a hint of a breeze to lighten Fatren's mood. He sighed, leaning back against the\nearthen bulwark, looking over Vetitan. His town.\n\"How long?\" he asked.\nDruffel scratched his nose. His face was stained black with ash. He hadn't given much thought to\nhygiene lately. Of course, considering the stress of the last few months, Fatren knew that he himself\nwasn't much to look at either.\n\"An hour, maybe,\" Druffel said, spitting into the dirt of the bulwark.\nFatren sighed, staring up at the falling ash. \"Do you think it's true, Druffel? What people are saying?\"\n\"What?\" Druffel asked. \"That the world is ending?\"\nFatren nodded.\n\"Don't know,\" Druffel said. \"Don't really care.\"\n\"How can you say that?\"\nDruffel shrugged, scratching himself. \"Soon as those koloss arrive, I'll be dead. That's pretty much the\nend of the world for me.\"\nFatren fell silent. He didn't like to voice his doubts; he was supposed to be the strong one. When the\nlords had left the town—a farming community, slightly more urban than a northern plantation—Fatren"

        "text": "Fatren fell silent. He didn't like to voice his doubts; he was supposed to be the strong one. When the\nlords had left the town—a farming community, slightly more urban than a northern plantation—Fatren\nhad been the one who had convinced the skaa to go ahead with their planting. Fatren had been the one\nto keep the press gangs away. In a time when most villages and plantations had lost every able-bodied\nman to one army or another, Vetitan still had a working population. It had cost much of their crops in\nbribes, but Fatren had kept the people safe.\nMostly.\n\"The mists didn't leave until noon today,\" Fatren said quietly. \"They're staying later and later. You've\nseen the crops, Druff. They're not doing well—not enough sunlight, I'd guess. We won't have food to eat\nthis winter.\"\n\"We won't last 'til winter,\" Druffel said. \"Won't last 'til nightfall.\"\nThe sad thing—the thing that was really disheartening—was that Druffel had once been the optimist.\nFatren hadn't heard his brother laugh in months. That laughter had been Fatren's favorite sound.\nEven the Lord Ruler's mills weren't able to grind Druff's laughter out of him, Fatren thought. But\nthese last two years have.\n\"Fats!\" a voice called. \"Fats!\"\nFatren looked up as a young boy scrambled along the side of the bulwark. They'd barely finished the\nfortification—it had been Druffel's idea, back before he'd really given up. Their town contained some\nseven thousand people, which made it fairly large. It had taken a great deal of work to surround the\nentire thing with a defensive mound.\nFatren had barely a thousand real soldiers—it had been very hard to gather that many from such a\nsmall population—with maybe another thousand men who were too young, too old, or too unskilled to\nfight well. He didn't really know how big the koloss army was, but it was bound to be larger than two\nthousand. A bulwark was going to be of very little use.\nThe boy—Sev—finally puffed up to Fatren. \"Fats!\" Sev said. \"Someone's coming!\"\n\"Already?\" Fatren asked. \"Druff said the koloss were still a while away!\"\n\"Not a koloss, Fats,\" the boy said. \"A man. Come see!\"\nFatren turned to Druff, who wiped his nose and shrugged. They followed Sev around the inside of the\nbulwark, toward the front gate. Ash and dust swirled on the packed earth, piling in corners, drifting.\nThere hadn't been much time for cleaning lately. The women had to work the fields while the men trained\nand made war preparations.\nWar preparations. Fatren told himself that he had a force of two thousand \"soldiers,\" but what he\nreally had were a thousand skaa peasants with swords. They'd had two years of training, true, but they\nhad very little real fighting experience.\nA group of men clustered around the front gates, standing on the bulwark or leaning against its side.\nMaybe I was wrong to spend so much of our resources training soldiers, Fatren thought. If those\nthousand men had worked the mines instead, we'd have some ore for bribes."

If those\nthousand men had worked the mines instead, we'd have some ore for bribes.\nExcept, koloss didn't take bribes. They just killed. Fatren shuddered, thinking of Garthwood. That city\nhad been bigger than his own, but fewer than a hundred survivors had made their way to Vetitan. That\nhad been three months ago. He'd hoped, irrationally, that the koloss would be satisfied with destroying\nthat city.\nHe should have known better. Koloss were never satisfied.\nFatren climbed up to the top of the bulwark, and soldiers in patched clothing and bits of leather made\nway for him. He peered through the falling ash across a dark landscape that looked as if it were\nblanketed in deep black snow.\nA lone rider approached, wearing a dark, hooded cloak.\n\"What do you think, Fats?\" one of the soldiers asked. \"Koloss scout?\"\nFatren snorted. \"Koloss wouldn't send a scout, especially not a human one.\"\n\"He has a horse,\" Druffel said with a grunt. \"We could use another of those.\" The city only had five. All\nwere suffering from malnutrition.\n\"Merchant,\" one of the soldiers said.\n\"No wares,\" Fatren said. \"And it would take a brave merchant to travel these parts alone.\"\n\"I've never seen a refugee with a horse,\" one of the men said. He raised a bow, looking at Fatren.\nFatren shook his head. Nobody fired as the stranger rode up, moving at an unhurried pace. He\nstopped his mount directly before the city gates. Fatren was proud of those. Real, true wooden gates\nmounted in the earthen bulwark. He'd gotten both wood and fine stone from the lord's manor at the city\ncenter.\nVery little of the stranger was visible beneath the thick, dark cloak he wore to protect himself from the\nash. Fatren looked over the top of the bulwark, studying the stranger, and then he glanced up at his\nbrother, shrugging. The ash fell silently.\nThe stranger leaped from his horse.\nHe shot straight upward, as if propelled from beneath, cloak whipping free as he soared. Underneath\nit, he wore a uniform of brilliant white.\nFatren cursed, jumping backward as the stranger crested the top of the bulwark and landed on the top\nof the wooden gate itself. The man was an Allomancer. A nobleman. Fatren had hoped those would all\nstick to their squabbles in the North and leave his people in peace.\nOr, at least, their peaceful deaths.\nThe newcomer turned. He wore a short beard, and had his dark hair shorn close. \"All right, men,\" he\nsaid, striding across the top of the gate with an unnatural sense of balance, \"we don't have much time.\nLet's get to work.\" He stepped off the gate onto the bulwark. Immediately, Druffel pulled his sword on\nthe newcomer.\nThe sword jerked from Druffel's hand, yanked into the air by an unseen force. The stranger snatched\nthe weapon as it passed his head. He flipped the sword around, inspecting it. \"Good steel,\" he said,"

        "text": "the weapon as it passed his head. He flipped the sword around, inspecting it. \"Good steel,\" he said,\nnodding. \"I'm impressed. How many of your soldiers are this well equipped?\" He flipped the weapon in\nhis hand, handing it back toward Druffel hilt-first.\nDruffel glanced at Fatren, confused.\n\"Who are you, stranger?\" Fatren demanded with as much courage as he could muster. He didn't know\na lot about Allomancy, but he was pretty certain this man was Mistborn. The stranger could probably kill\neveryone atop the bulwark with barely a thought.\nThe stranger ignored the question, turning to scan the city. \"This bulwark goes around the entire\nperimeter of the city?\" he asked, turning toward one of the soldiers.\n\"Um . . . yes, my lord,\" the man said.\n\"How many gates are there?\"\n\"Just the one, my lord.\"\n\"Open the gate and bring my horse in,\" the newcomer said. \"I assume you have stables?\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" the soldier said.\nWell, Fatren thought with dissatisfaction as the soldier ran off, this newcomer certainly knows how\nto command people. Fatren's soldier didn't even pause to think that he was obeying a stranger without\nasking for permission. Fatren could already see the other soldiers straightening a bit, losing their wariness.\nThis newcomer talked like he expected to be obeyed, and the soldiers were responding. This wasn't a\nnobleman like the ones Fatren had known back when he was a household servant at the lord's manor.\nThis man was different.\nThe stranger continued his contemplation of the city. Ash fell on his beautiful white uniform, and Fatren\nthought it a shame to see the garment being dirtied. The newcomer nodded to himself, then began to walk\ndown the side of the bulwark.\n\"Wait,\" Fatren said, causing the stranger to pause. \"Who are you?\"\nThe newcomer turned, meeting Fatren's eyes. \"My name is Elend Venture. I'm your emperor.\"\nWith that, the man turned and continued down the embankment. The soldiers made way for him; then\nmany of them followed behind.\nFatren glanced at his brother.\n\"Emperor?\" Druffel muttered, then spat.\nFatren agreed with the sentiment. What to do? He'd never fought an Allomancer before; he wasn't\neven certain how to begin. The \"emperor\" had certainly disarmed Druffel easily enough.\n\"Organize the people of the city,\" the stranger—Elend Venture—said from ahead. \"The koloss will\ncome from the north—they'll ignore the gate, climbing over the bulwark. I want the children and the\nelderly concentrated in the southernmost part of the city. Pack them together in as few buildings as\npossible.\"\n\"What good will that do?\" Fatren demanded. He hurried after the \"emperor\"—he didn't really see any\nother option.\n\"The koloss are most dangerous when they're in a blood frenzy,\" Venture said, continuing to walk. \"If\nthey do take the city, then you want them to spend as long as possible searching for your people. If the\nkoloss frenzy wears off while they search, they'll grow frustrated and turn to looting. Then your people\nmight be able to sneak away without being chased.\""

Then your people\nmight be able to sneak away without being chased.\"\nVenture paused, then turned to meet Fatren's eyes. The stranger's expression was grim. \"It's a slim\nhope. But, it's something.\" With that, he resumed his pace, walking down the city's main thoroughfare.\nFrom behind, Fatren could hear the soldiers whispering. They'd all heard of a man named Elend\nVenture. He was the one who had seized power in Luthadel after the Lord Ruler's death over two years\nbefore. News from up north was scarce and unreliable, but most of it mentioned Venture. He had fought\noff all rivals to the throne, even killing his own father. He'd hidden his nature as a Mistborn, and was\nsupposedly married to the very woman who had slain the Lord Ruler. Fatren doubted that such an\nimportant man—one who was likely more legend than fact—had made his way to such a humble city in\nthe Southern Dominance, especially unaccompanied. Even the mines weren't worth much anymore. The\nstranger had to be lying.\nBut . . . he was obviously an Allomancer . . .\nFatren hurried to keep up with the stranger. Venture—or whoever he was—paused in front of a large\nstructure near the center of the city. The old offices of the Steel Ministry. Fatren had ordered the doors\nand windows boarded up.\n\"You found the weapons in there?\" Venture asked, turning toward Fatren.\nFatren stood for a moment. Then, finally, shook his head. \"From the lord's mansion.\"\n\"He left weapons behind?\" Venture asked with surprise.\n\"We think he intended to come back for them,\" Fatren said. \"The soldiers he left eventually deserted,\njoining a passing army. They took what they could carry. We scavenged the rest.\"\nVenture nodded to himself, rubbing his bearded chin in thought as he stared at the old Ministry\nbuilding. It was tall and ominous, despite—or perhaps because of—its disuse. \"Your men look well\ntrained. I didn't expect that. Do any of them have battle experience?\"\nDruffel snorted quietly, indicating that he thought this stranger had no business being so nosy.\n\"Our men have fought enough to be dangerous, stranger,\" Fatren said. \"Some bandits thought to take\nrule of the city from us. They assumed we were weak, and would be easily cowed.\"\nIf the stranger saw the words as a threat, he didn't show it. He simply nodded. \"Have any of you\nfought koloss?\"\nFatren shared a look with Druffel. \"Men who fight koloss don't live, stranger,\" he finally said.\n\"If that were true,\" Venture said, \"I'd be dead a dozen times over.\" He turned to face the growing\ncrowd of soldiers and townspeople. \"I'll teach you what I can about fighting koloss, but we don't have\nmuch time. I want captains and squad leaders organized at the city gate in ten minutes. Regular soldiers\nare to form up in ranks along the bulwark—I'll teach the squad leaders and captains a few tricks, then\nthey can carry the tips to their men.\"\nSome of the soldiers moved, but—to their credit—most of them stayed where they were.

The\nnewcomer didn't seem offended that his orders weren't obeyed. He stood quietly, staring down the\narmed crowd. He didn't seem frightened, nor did he seem angry or disapproving. He just seemed . . .\nregal.\n\"My lord,\" one of the soldier captains finally asked. \"Did you . . . bring an army with you to help us?\"\n\"I brought two, actually,\" Venture said. \"But we don't have time to wait for them.\" He met Fatren's\neyes. \"You wrote and asked for my help. And, as your liege, I've come to give it. Do you still want it?\"\nFatren frowned. He'd never asked this man—or any lord—for help. He opened his mouth to object,\nbut paused. He'll let me pretend that I sent for him, Fatren thought. Act like this was part of the plan\nall along. I could give up rule here without looking like a failure.\nWe're going to die. But, looking into this man's eyes, I can almost believe that we have a chance\n.\n\"I . . . didn't expect you to come alone, my lord,\" Fatren found himself saying. \"I was surprised to see\nyou.\"\nVenture nodded. \"That is understandable. Come, let's talk tactics while your soldiers gather.\"\n\"Very well,\" Fatren said. As he stepped forward, however, Druffel caught his arm.\n\"What are you doing?\" his brother hissed. \"You sent for this man? I don't believe it.\"\n\"Gather the soldiers, Druff,\" Fatren said.\nDruffel stood for a moment, then swore quietly and stalked away. He didn't look like he had any\nintention of gathering the soldiers, so Fatren waved for two of his captains to do it. That done, he joined\nVenture, and the two walked back toward the gates, Venture ordering a few soldiers to walk ahead of\nthem and keep people back so that he and Fatren could speak more privately. Ash continued to fall from\nthe sky, dusting the street black, clustering atop the city's stooped, one-story buildings.\n\"Who are you?\" Fatren asked quietly.\n\"I am who I said,\" Venture said.\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\"But you trust me,\" Venture said.\n\"No. I just don't want to argue with an Allomancer.\"\n\"That's good enough, for now,\" Venture said. \"Look, friend, you have ten thousand koloss marching\non your city. You need whatever help you can get.\"\nTen thousand? Fatren thought, feeling stupefied.\n\"You're in charge of this city, I assume?\" Venture asked.\nFatren shook out of his stupor. \"Yes,\" he said. \"My name is Fatren.\"\n\"All right, Lord Fatren, we—\"\n\"I'm no lord,\" Fatren said.\n\"Well, you just became one,\" Venture said. \"You can choose a surname later. Now, before we\ncontinue, you need to know my conditions for helping you.\"\n\"What kind of conditions?\"\n\"The nonnegotiable kind,\" Venture said. \"If we win, you'll swear fealty to me.\"\nFatren frowned, stopping in the street. Ash fell around him. \"So that's it? You saunter in before a fight,"

Why should I swear fealty to a man\nI only met a few minutes before?\"\n\"Because if you don't,\" Venture said quietly, \"I'll just take command anyway.\" Then he continued to\nwalk.\nFatren stood for a moment; then he rushed forward and caught up to Venture. \"Oh, I see. Even if we\nsurvive this battle, we'll end up ruled by a tyrant.\"\n\"Yes,\" Venture said.\nFatren frowned. He hadn't expected the man to be so blunt.\nVenture shook his head, regarding the city through the falling ash. \"I used to think that I could do things\ndifferently. And, I still believe that I'll be able to, someday. But, for now, I don't have a choice. I need\nyour soldiers and I need your city.\"\n\"My city?\" Fatren asked, frowning. \"Why?\"\nVenture held up a finger. \"We have to survive this battle first,\" he said. \"We'll get to other things later.\"\nFatren paused, and was surprised to realize that he did trust the stranger. He couldn't have explained\nexactly why he felt that way. This was simply a man to follow—a leader such as Fatren had always\nwanted to be.\nVenture didn't wait for Fatren to agree to the \"conditions.\" It wasn't an offer, but an ultimatum. Fatren\nhurried to catch up again as Venture entered the small square in front of the city gates. Soldiers bustled\nabout. None of them wore uniforms—their only method of distinguishing a captain from a regular soldier\nwas a red band tied around the arm. Venture hadn't given them much time to gather—but, then, they all\nknew the city was about to be attacked. They had been gathered anyway.\n\"Time is short,\" Venture repeated in a loud voice. \"I can teach you only a few things, but they will\nmake a difference.\n\"Koloss range in size from small ones that are about five feet tall to the huge ones, which are about\ntwelve feet tall. However, even the little ones are going to be stronger than you are. Expect that.\nFortunately, the creatures fight without coordination between individuals. If a koloss's comrade is in\ntrouble, he won't bother to help.\n\"They attack directly, without guile, and try to use blunt force to overwhelm. Don't let them! Tell your\nmen to gang up on individual koloss—two men for the small ones, three or four for the big ones. We\nwon't be able to maintain a very large front, but that will keep us alive the longest.\n\"Don't worry about creatures that get around our line and enter the city—we'll have the civilians hidden\nat the very back of your town, and the koloss who bypass our line might turn to pillaging, leaving others\nto fight alone. That's what we want! Don't chase them down into the city. Your families will be safe.\n\"If you're fighting a big koloss, attack the legs, bring it down before you go for the kill. If you're fighting\na small one, make certain your sword or spear doesn't get caught in their loose skin. Understand that"

They didn't cheer at the speech, but\nthey did seem a little more confident. They moved off to pass on Venture's instructions to their men.\nFatren approached the emperor quietly. \"If your count is correct, they outnumber us five to one.\"\nVenture nodded.\n\"They're bigger, stronger, and better trained than we are.\"\nVenture nodded again.\n\"We're doomed, then.\"\nVenture finally looked at Fatren, frowning, black ash dusting his shoulders. \"You're not doomed. You\nhave something they don't—something very important.\"\n\"What's that?\"\nVenture met his eyes. \"You have me.\"\n\"My lord emperor!\" a voice called from atop the bulwark. \"Koloss sighted!\"\nThey already call to him first, Fatren thought. Fatren wasn't certain whether to be insulted or\nimpressed.\nVenture immediately jumped up to the top of the bulwark, using his Allomancy to cross the distance in\na quick bound. Most of the soldiers stooped or hid behind the top of the fortification, keeping a low\nprofile despite the distance of their enemies. Venture, however, stood proud in his white cape and\nuniform, shading his eyes, squinting toward the horizon.\n\"They're setting up camp,\" he said, smiling. \"Good. Lord Fatren, prepare the men for an assault.\"\n\"An assault?\" Fatren asked, scrambling up behind Venture.\nThe emperor nodded. \"The koloss will be tired from marching, and will be distracted by making camp.\nWe'll never have a better opportunity to attack them.\"\n\"But, we're on the defensive!\"\nVenture shook his head. \"If we wait, they'll eventually whip themselves into a blood frenzy, then come\nagainst us. We need to attack, rather than just wait to be slaughtered.\"\n\"And abandon the bulwark?\"\n\"The fortification is impressive, Lord Fatren, but ultimately useless. You don't have the numbers to\ndefend the entire perimeter, and the koloss are generally taller and more stable than men. They'll just take\nthe bulwark from you, then hold the high ground as they push down into the city.\"\n\"But—\"\nVenture looked at him. His eyes were calm, but his gaze was firm and expectant. The message was\nsimple. I am in charge now. There would be no more arguing.\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Fatren said, calling over messengers to pass the orders.\nVenture stood watching as the messenger boys dashed off. There seemed to be some confusion\namong the men—they weren't expecting to attack. More and more eyes turned toward Venture, standing\ntall atop the bulwark.\nHe really does look like an emperor, Fatren thought despite himself."

More and more eyes turned toward Venture, standing\ntall atop the bulwark.\nHe really does look like an emperor, Fatren thought despite himself.\nThe orders moved down the line. Time passed. Finally, the entire army was watching. Venture pulled\nout his sword and held it high in the ash-scattered sky. Then, he took off down the bulwark in an\ninhumanly quick dash, charging toward the koloss camp.\nFor a moment, he ran alone. Then, surprising himself, Fatren gritted his teeth against shaking nerves\nand followed.\nThe bulwark exploded with motion, the soldiers charging with a collective yell, running toward death\nwith their weapons held high.\nHolding the power did strange things to my mind. In just a few moments, I became familiar with\nthe power itself, with its history, and with the ways it might be used.\nYet, this knowledge was different from experience, or even ability to use that power. For\ninstance, I knew how to move a planet in the sky. Yet, I didn't know where to place it so that it\nwouldn't be too close, or too far, from the sun.\n2\nAS ALWAYS, TENSOON'S DAY began in darkness. Part of that was due, of course, to the fact that\nhe didn't have any eyes. He could have created a set—he was of the Third Generation, which was old,\neven for a kandra. He had digested enough corpses that he had learned how to create sensory organs\nintuitively without a model to copy.\nUnfortunately, eyes would have done him little good. He didn't have a skull, and he had found that\nmost organs didn't function well without a full body—and skeleton—to support them. His own mass\nwould crush eyes if he moved the wrong way, and it would be very difficult to turn them about to see.\nNot that there would be anything to look at. TenSoon moved his bulk slightly, shifting inside his prison\nchamber. His body was little more than a grouping of translucent muscles—like a mass of large snails or\nslugs, all connected, somewhat more malleable than the body of a mollusk. With concentration, he could\ndissolve one of the muscles and either meld it with another one, or make something new. Yet, without a\nskeleton to use, he was all but impotent.\nHe shifted in his cell again. His very skin had a sense of its own—a kind of taste. Right now, it tasted\nthe stench of his own excrement on the sides of the chamber, but he didn't dare turn off this sense. It was\none of his only connections to the world around him.\nThe \"cell\" was actually nothing more than a grate-covered stone pit. It was barely large enough to hold\nhis mass. His captors dumped food in from the top, then periodically poured water in to hydrate him and\nwash his excrement out through a small drainage hole at the bottom. Both this hole and those in the\nlocked grate above were too small for him to slide through—a kandra's body was supple, but even a pile\nof muscles could be squeezed only so small.\nMost people would have gone mad from the stress of being so confined for . . . he didn't even know\nhow long it had been. Months? But TenSoon had the Blessing of Presence. His mind would not give in\neasily."

His mind would not give in\neasily.\nSometimes he cursed the Blessing for keeping him from the blissful relief of madness.\nFocus, he told himself. He had no brain, not as humans did, but he was able to think. He didn't\nunderstand this. He wasn't certain if any kandra did. Perhaps those of the First Generation knew\nmore—but if so, they didn't enlighten everyone else.\nThey can't keep you here forever, he told himself. The First Contract says. . .\nBut he was beginning to doubt the First Contract—or, rather, that the First Generation paid any\nattention to it. But, could he blame them? TenSoon was a Contract-breaker. By his own admission, he\nhad gone against the will of his master, helping another instead. This betrayal had ended with his master's\ndeath.\nYet, even such a shameful act was the least of his crimes. The punishment for Contract-breaking was\ndeath, and if TenSoon's crimes had stopped there, the others would have killed him and been done with\nit. Unfortunately, there was much more at stake. TenSoon's testimony—given to the Second Generation\nin a closed conference—had revealed a much more dangerous, much more important, lapse.\nTenSoon had betrayed his people's secret.\nThey can't execute me, he thought, using the idea to keep him focused. Not until they find out who\nI told.\nThe secret. The precious, precious secret.\nI've doomed us all. My entire people. We'll be slaves again. No, we're already slaves. We'll\nbecome something else—automatons, our minds controlled by others. Captured and used, our\nbodies no longer our own.\nThis was what he had done—what he had potentially set in motion. The reason he deserved\nimprisonment and death. And yet, he wished to live. He should despise himself. But, for some reason, he\nstill felt he had done the right thing.\nHe shifted again, masses of slick muscle rotating around one another. Midshift, however, he froze.\nVibrations. Someone was coming.\nHe arranged himself, pushing his muscles to the sides of the pit, forming a depression in the middle of\nhis body. He needed to catch all of the food that he could—they fed him precious little. However, no\nslop came pouring down through the grate. He waited, expectant, until the grate unlocked. Though he\nhad no ears, he could feel the coarse vibrations as the grate was dragged back, its rough iron finally\ndropped against the floor above.\nWhat?\nHooks came next. They looped around his muscles, grabbing him and ripping his flesh as they pulled\nhim out of the pit. It hurt. Not just the hooks, but the sudden freedom as his body was spilled across the\nfloor of the prison. He unwillingly tasted dirt and dried slop. His muscles quivered, the unfettered motion\nof being outside the cell felt strange, and he strained, moving his bulk in ways that he had nearly forgotten.\nThen it came. He could taste it in the air. Acid, thick and pungent, presumably in a gold-lined bucket\nbrought by the prison keepers. They were going to kill him after all.\nBut, they can't! he thought.

Not acid, but something hard. He touched it eagerly, muscles moving against\none another, tasting it, testing it, feeling it. It was round, with holes, and several sharp edges . . . a skull.\nThe acid stink grew sharper. Were they stirring it? TenSoon moved quickly, forming around the skull,\nfilling it. He already had some dissolved flesh stored inside of an organ-like pouch. He brought this out,\noozing it around the skull, quickly making skin. He left the eyes alone, working on lungs, forming a\ntongue, ignoring lips for the moment. He worked with a sense of desperation as the taste of acid grew\nstrong, and then . . .\nIt hit him. It seared the muscles on one side of his body, washing over his bulk, dissolving it.\nApparently, the Second Generation had given up on getting his secrets from him. However, before killing\nhim, they knew they had to give him an opportunity to speak. The First Contract required it—hence the\nskull. However, the guards obviously had orders to kill him before he could actually say anything in his\ndefense. They followed the form of the law, yet at the very same time they ignored its intent.\nThey didn't realize, however, how quickly TenSoon could work. Few kandra had spent as much time\non Contracts as he had—all of the Second Generation, and most of the Third, had long ago retired from\nservice. They led easy lives here in the Homeland.\nAn easy life taught one very little.\nMost kandra took hours to form a body—some younger ones needed days. In seconds, however,\nTenSoon had a rudimentary tongue. As the acid moved up his body, he forced out a trachea, inflated a\nlung, and croaked out a single word:\n\"Judgment!\"\nThe pouring stopped. His body continued to burn. He worked through the pain, forming primitive\nhearing organs inside the skull cavity.\nA voice whispered nearby. \"Fool.\"\n\"Judgment!\" TenSoon said again.\n\"Accept death,\" the voice hissed quietly. \"Do not put yourself in a position to cause further harm to our\npeople. The First Generation has granted you this chance to die because of your years of extra service!\"\nTenSoon paused. A trial would be public. So far, only a select few knew the extent of his betrayal. He\ncould die, cursed as a Contract-breaker but retaining some measure of respect for his prior career.\nSomewhere—likely in a pit in this very room—there were some who suffered endless captivity, a torture\nthat would eventually break even the minds of those endowed with the Blessing of Presence.\nDid he want to become one of those? By revealing his actions in an open forum, he would earn himself\nan eternity of pain. Forcing a trial would be foolish, for there was no hope of vindication. His confessions\nhad already damned him.\nIf he spoke, it would not be to defend himself. It would be for other reasons entirely.\n\"Judgment,\" he repeated, this time barely whispering.\nIn some ways, having such power was too overwhelming, I think. This was a power that would"

Remaking the world would have been easy, had one been familiar\nwith the power. Yet, I realized the danger inherent in my ignorance. Like a child suddenly given\nawesome strength, I could have pushed too hard, and left the world a broken toy I could never\nrepair.\n3\nELEND VENTURE, SECOND EMPEROR of the Final Empire, had not been born a warrior. He'd\nbeen born a nobleman—which, in the Lord Ruler's day, had essentially made Elend a professional\nsocialite. He'd spent his youth learning to play the frivolous games of the Great Houses, living the\npampered lifestyle of the imperial elite.\nIt wasn't odd for him to have ended up a politician. He'd always been interested in political theory, and\nwhile he'd been more a scholar than a true statesman, he'd known that someday he'd rule his house. Yet,\nhe hadn't made a very good king at first. He hadn't understood that there was more to leadership than\ngood ideas and honest intentions. Far more.\nI doubt you will ever be the type of leader who can lead a charge against the enemy, Elend\nVenture. The words had been spoken by Tindwyl—the woman who'd trained him in practical politics.\nRemembering those words made Elend smile as his soldiers crashed into the koloss camp.\nElend flared pewter. A warm sensation—now familiar to him—burst to life in his chest, and his\nmuscles became taut with extra strength and energy. He'd swallowed the metal earlier, so that he could\ndraw upon its powers for the battle. He was an Allomancer. That still awed him sometimes.\nAs he'd predicted, the koloss were surprised by the attack. They stood motionless for a few moments,\nshocked—even though they must have seen Elend's newly recruited army as it charged. Koloss had\ntrouble dealing with the unexpected. They found it hard to comprehend a group of weak, outnumbered\nhumans attacking their camp. So, it took them time to adjust.\nElend's army made good use of that time. Elend himself struck first, flaring his pewter to give himself\nyet more power as he cut down the first koloss. It was a smaller beast. Like all of its kind, it was\nhuman-like in form, though it had oversized, drooping blue skin that seemed detached from the rest of its\nbody. Its beady red eyes showed a bit of inhuman surprise as it died, Elend yanking his sword from its\nchest.\n\"Strike quickly!\" he yelled as more koloss turned from their firepits. \"Kill as many as you can before\nthey frenzy!\"\nHis soldiers—terrified, but committed—charged in around him, overrunning the first few groups of\nkoloss. The \"camp\" was little more than a place where the koloss had tromped down ash and the plants\nbeneath, then dug firepits. Elend could see his men growing more confident at their initial success, and he\nencouraged them by Pulling on their emotions with Allomancy, making them braver.

He was more\ncomfortable with this form of Allomancy—he still hadn't quite gotten the hang of leaping about with\nmetals the way Vin did. Emotions, however—those he understood.\nFatren, the city's burly leader, stuck near Elend as he led a group of soldiers toward a large pack of\nkoloss. Elend kept an eye on the man. Fatren was the ruler of this small city; if he died, it would be a\nblow to morale. Together, they rushed a small group of surprised koloss. The largest beast in that group\nwas some eleven feet tall. Like that of all large koloss, this creature's skin—once loose—was now pulled\ntight around its oversized body. Koloss never stopped growing, but their skin always remained the same\nsize. On the younger creatures, it hung loose and folded. On the big ones, it stretched and ripped.\nElend burned steel, then threw a handful of coins into the air in front of him. He Pushed on the coins,\nthrowing his weight against them, spraying them at the koloss. The beasts were too tough to fall to simple\ncoins with any reliability, but the bits of metal would injure and weaken them.\nAs the coins flew, Elend charged the large koloss. The beast pulled a huge sword off its back, and it\nseemed elated at the prospect of a fight.\nThe koloss swung first, and it had an awesome reach. Elend had to jump backward—pewter making\nhim more nimble. Koloss swords were massive, brutish things, so blunt they were almost clubs. The force\nof the blow shook the air; Elend wouldn't have had a chance to turn the blade aside, even with pewter\nhelping him. In addition, the sword—or, more accurately, the koloss holding it—weighed so much that\nElend wouldn't be able to use Allomancy to Push it out of the creature's hands. Pushing with steel was all\nabout weight and force. If Elend Pushed on something heavier than himself, he'd be thrown backward.\nSo, Elend had to rely on the extra speed and dexterity of pewter. He threw himself out of his dodge,\ndashing to the side, watching for a backhand. The creature turned, silent, eyeing Elend, but didn't strike.\nIt hadn't quite frenzied yet.\nElend stared down his oversized enemy. How did I get here? he thought, not for the first time. I'm a\nscholar, not a warrior. Half the time he thought he had no business leading men at all.\nThe other half the time, he figured that he thought too much. He ducked forward, striking. The koloss\nanticipated the move, and tried to bring its weapon down on Elend's head. Elend, however, reached out\nand Pulled on the sword of another koloss—throwing that creature off balance and allowing two of\nElend's men to slay it, and also Pulling Elend himself to the side. He just barely evaded his opponent's\nweapon. Then, as he spun in the air, he flared pewter and struck from the side.\nHe sheared completely through the beast's leg at the knee, toppling it to the ground. Vin always said"

Vin always said\nthat Elend's Allomantic power was unusually strong. Elend wasn't certain about that—he didn't have\nmuch experience with Allomancy—but the force of his own swing did send him stumbling. He managed\nto regain his footing, however, and then took off the creature's head.\nSeveral of the soldiers were staring at him. His white uniform was now sprayed with bright red koloss\nblood. It wasn't the first time. Elend took a deep breath as he heard inhuman screams sounding through\nthe camp. The frenzy was beginning.\n\"Form up!\" Elend shouted. \"Make lines, stay together, prepare for the assault!\"\nThe soldiers responded slowly. They were far less disciplined than the troops Elend was accustomed\nto, but they did an admirable job of bunching up at his command. Elend glanced across the ground\nbefore them. They'd managed to take down several hundred koloss—an amazing feat.\nThe easy part, however, was over.\n\"Stay firm!\" Elend yelled, running down in front of the soldier line. \"But keep fighting! We need to kill\nas many of them as quickly as possible! Everything depends on this! Give them your fury, men!\"\nHe burned brass and Pushed on their emotions, Soothing away their fear. An Allomancer couldn't\ncontrol minds—not human minds, at least—but he could encourage some emotions while discouraging\nothers. Again, Vin said that Elend was able to affect far more people than should have been possible.\nElend had gained his powers recently, directly from a place he now suspected was the original source of\nAllomancy.\nUnder the influence of the Soothing, his soldiers stood up straight. Again, Elend felt a healthy respect\nfor these simple skaa. He was giving them bravery and taking away some of their fear, but the\ndetermination was their own. These were good people.\nWith luck, he'd be able to save some of them.\nThe koloss attacked. As he'd hoped, a large group of the creatures broke away from the main camp\nand charged toward the village. Some of the soldiers cried out, but they were too busy defending\nthemselves to follow. Elend threw himself into the fray whenever the line wobbled, shoring up the weak\npoint. As he did so, he burned brass and tried to Push on the emotions of a nearby koloss.\nNothing happened. The creatures were resistant to emotional Allomancy, particularly when they were\nalready being manipulated by someone else. However, when he did break through, he could take\ncomplete control of them. That, required time, luck, and a determination to fight tirelessly.\nAnd so, he did. He fought alongside the men, watching them die, killing koloss as his line bent at the\nedges, forming a half circle to keep his troops from being surrounded. Even so, the fighting was grim. As\nmore and more koloss frenzied and charged, the odds quickly turned against Elend's group. Still, the\nkoloss resisted his emotional manipulation. But they were getting closer . . .\n\"We're doomed!\" Fatren screamed.\nElend turned, a bit surprised to see the beefy lord beside him and still alive. The men continued to fight."

He was covered in koloss blood, though a patch on his shoulder\nlooked to be his own. \"Why?\" Fatren demanded.\nElend simply pointed as the speck grew larger.\n\"What is it?\" Fatren asked over the chaos of battle.\nElend smiled. \"The first of those armies I promised you.\"\nVin fell from the sky in a tempest of horseshoes, landing directly at the center of the koloss army.\nWithout hesitating, she used Allomancy to Push a pair of horseshoes toward a turning koloss. One\ntook the creature in the forehead, throwing it backward, and the other shot over its head, hitting another\nkoloss. Vin spun, flipping out another shoe, shooting it past a particularly large beast and taking down a\nsmaller koloss behind him.\nShe flared iron, Pulling that horseshoe back, catching it around the larger koloss's wrist. Immediately,\nher Pull yanked her toward the beast—but it also threw the creature off balance. Its massive iron sword\ndropped to the ground as Vin hit the creature in the chest. Then, she Pushed off the fallen sword,\nthrowing herself upward in a backward flip as another koloss swung at her.\nShe shot some fifteen feet into the air. The sword missed, cutting off the head of the koloss beneath\nher. The koloss who had swung didn't seem to mind that it had killed a comrade; it just looked up at her,\nbloodred eyes hateful.\nVin Pulled on the fallen sword. It lurched up at her, but also pulled her down with its weight. She\ncaught it as she fell—the sword was nearly as tall as she was, but flared pewter let her handle it with\nease—and she sheared free the attacking koloss's arm as she landed.\nShe took its legs off at the knees, then left it to die as she spun toward other opponents. As always,\nthe koloss seemed fascinated—in an enraged, baffled way—with Vin. They associated large size with\ndanger and had difficulty understanding how a small woman like Vin—twenty years old, barely over five\nfeet in height and slight as a willow—could pose a threat. Yet, they saw her kill, and this drew them to\nher.\nVin was just fine with that.\nShe screamed as she attacked, if only to add some sound to the too-silent battlefield. Koloss tended\nto stop yelling as they entered their frenzy, growing focused only on killing. She threw out a handful of\ncoins, Pushing them toward the group behind her, then jumped forward, Pulling on a sword.\nA koloss in front of her stumbled. She landed on its back, attacking a creature beside it. This one fell,\nand Vin rammed her sword down into the back of the one below her.

That same Push threw her\nbackward out of the way of an attack. She grabbed the sword from the back of the one she'd stabbed\nbefore, ripping the weapon free even as the creature died. And, in one fluid stroke, she slammed it down\nthrough the collarbone and chest of a fifth beast.\nShe landed. Koloss fell dead around her.\nVin was not fury. She was not terror. She had grown beyond those things. She had seen Elend\ndie—had held him in her arms as he did—and had known that she had let it happen. Intentionally.\nAnd yet, he still lived. Every breath was unexpected, perhaps undeserved. Once, she'd been terrified\nthat she would fail him. But, she had found peace—somehow—in understanding that she couldn't keep\nhim from risking his life. In understanding that she didn't want to keep him from risking his life.\nSo, she no longer fought out of fear for the man she loved. Instead, she fought with an understanding.\nShe was a knife—Elend's knife, the Final Empire's knife. She didn't fight to protect one man, but to\nprotect the way of life he had created, and the people he struggled so hard to defend.\nPeace gave her strength.\nKoloss died around her, and scarlet blood—too bright to be human—stained the air. There were ten\nthousand in this army—far too many for her to kill. However, she didn't need to slaughter every koloss in\nthe army.\nShe just had to make them afraid.\nBecause, despite what she'd once assumed, koloss could feel fear. She saw it building in the creatures\naround her, hidden beneath frustration and rage. A koloss attacked her, and she dodged to the side,\nmoving with pewter's enhanced speed. She slammed a sword into its back as she moved, and spun,\nnoticing a massive creature pushing its way through the army toward her.\nPerfect, she thought. It was big—perhaps the biggest one she had ever seen. It had to be almost\nthirteen feet tall. Heart failure should have killed it long ago, and its skin was ripped half free, hanging in\nwide flaps.\nIt bellowed, the sound echoing across the oddly quiet battlefield. Vin smiled, then burned duralumin.\nImmediately, the pewter already burning inside of her exploded to give her a massive, instantaneous burst\nof strength. Duralumin, when used with another metal, amplified that second metal and made it burn out in\na single burst, giving up all of its power at once.\nVin burned steel, then Pushed outward in all directions. Her duralumin-enhanced Push crashed like a\nwave into the swords of the creatures running at her. Weapons ripped free, koloss were thrown\nbackward, and massive bodies scattered like mere flakes of ash beneath the bloodred sun.\nDuralumin-enhanced pewter kept her from being crushed as she did this.\nHer pewter and steel both disappeared, burned away in single flash of power.

A smaller koloss tried to stop her, but she caught its arm by the wrist, then twisted, breaking\nthe joint. She took the creature's sword, ducking beneath another koloss's attack, and spun, felling three\ndifferent koloss in one sweep by cutting at their knees.\nAs she completed her spin, she rammed her sword into the earth point-first. As expected, the large,\nthirteen-foot-tall beast attacked a second later, swinging a sword that was so large that it made the air\nroar. Vin planted her sword just in time, for—even with pewter—she never would have been able to\nparry this enormous creature's weapon. That weapon, however, slammed into the blade of her sword,\nwhich was stabilized by the earth below. The metal quivered beneath her hands, but she held against the\nblow.\nFingers still stinging from the shock of such a powerful block, Vin let go of the sword and jumped. She\ndidn't Push—she didn't need to—but landed on the cross guard of her sword and leaped off it. The\nkoloss showed that same, characteristic surprise as it saw her leap thirteen feet into the air, leg drawn\nback, tasseled mist-cloak flapping.\nShe kicked the koloss directly in the side of the head. The skull cracked. Koloss were inhumanly\ntough, but her flared pewter was enough. The creature's beady eyes rolled back in its head, and it\ncollapsed. Vin Pushed slightly on the sword, keeping herself up long enough so that when she fell, she\nlanded directly on the felled koloss's chest.\nThe koloss around her froze. Even in the midst of the blood fury, they were shocked to see her drop\nsuch an enormous beast with only a kick. Perhaps their minds were too slow to process what they had\njust seen. Or, perhaps in addition to fear, they really could feel a measure of wariness. Vin didn't know\nenough about them to tell. She did understand that in a regular koloss army, what she'd just done would\nhave earned her the obedience of every creature that had watched her.\nUnfortunately, this army was being controlled by an external force. Vin stood up straight, could see\nElend's small, desperate army in the distance. Under Elend's guidance, they held. The fighting humans\nwould have an effect on the koloss similar to Vin's mysterious strength—the creatures wouldn't\nunderstand how such a small force could hold against them. They wouldn't see the attrition, or the dire\nsituation of Elend's group; they would simply see a smaller, inferior army standing and fighting.\nVin turned to resume combat. The koloss approached her with more trepidation, but they still came.\nThat was the oddity about koloss. They never retreated. They felt fear, they just couldn't act on it. It did,\nhowever, weaken them. She could see it in the way they approached her, the way they looked. They\nwere close to breaking.\nAnd so, she burned brass and Pushed on the emotions of one of the smaller creatures. At first, it"

And, finally, something broke within the creature and he became hers. The\none who had been controlling him was too far away, and was focused on too many koloss at once. This\ncreature—its mind confused because of the frenzy, emotions in a turmoil because of its shock, fear, and\nfrustration—came completely under Vin's mental control.\nImmediately, she ordered the creature to attack his companions. He was cut down a moment later, but\nnot before he killed two other koloss. As Vin fought, she snatched up another koloss, then another. She\nstruck randomly, fighting with her sword to keep the koloss distracted as she plucked members from\ntheir group and turned them. Soon, the area around her was in chaos, and she had a small line of koloss\nfighting for her. Every time one fell, she replaced it with two more.\nAs she fought, she spared a glanced for Elend's group again, and was relieved to find a large segment\nof koloss fighting alongside the group of humans. Elend himself moved among them, no longer fighting,\nfocused on snatching koloss after koloss to his side. It had been a gamble for Elend to come to this city\non his own, one she wasn't sure she approved of. For the moment, she was just glad she'd managed to\ncatch up in time.\nTaking Elend's cue, she stopped fighting, and instead concentrated on commanding her small force of\nkoloss, snatching up new members one at a time. Soon, she had a group of almost a hundred fighting for\nher.\nWon't be long now, she thought. And, sure enough, she soon caught sight of a speck in the air,\nshooting toward her through the falling ash. The speck resolved into a figure in dark robes, bounding over\nthe army by Pushing down on koloss swords. The tall figure was bald, its face tattooed. In the\nash-darkened light of midday, Vin could make out the two thick spikes that had been driven point-first\nthrough its eyes. A Steel Inquisitor, one she didn't recognize.\nThe Inquisitor hit hard, cutting down one of Vin's stolen koloss with a pair of obsidian axes. It focused\nits sightless gaze on Vin, and despite herself she felt a stirring of panic. A succession of distinct memories\nflashed in her mind. A dark night, rainy and shadowed. Spires and towers. A pain in her side. A long\nnight spent captive in the Lord Ruler's palace.\nKelsier, the Survivor of Hathsin, dying on the streets of Luthadel.\nVin burned electrum. This created a cloud of images around her, shadows of possible things she could\ndo in the future. Electrum, the Allomantic complement of gold. Elend had started calling it \"poor man's\natium.\" It wouldn't affect the battle much, other than to make her immune to atium, should the Inquisitor\nhave any.\nVin gritted her teeth, dashing forward as the koloss army overwhelmed her few remaining stolen\ncreatures.

She jumped, Pushing slightly on a fallen sword and letting her momentum carry her toward the\nInquisitor. The specter lifted its axes, swinging, but at the last moment Vin Pulled herself to the side. Her\nPull wrenched a sword from the hands of a surprised koloss, and she caught this while spinning in the air,\nthen Pushed it at the Inquisitor.\nHe Pushed the massive wedge of a weapon aside with barely a glance. Kelsier had managed to defeat\nan Inquisitor, but only after a great deal of effort. He himself had died moments later, struck dead by the\nLord Ruler.\nNo more memories! Vin told herself forcefully. Focus on the moment.\nAsh whipped past her as she spun in the air, still flying from her Push against the sword. She landed,\nfoot slipping in koloss blood, then dashed at the Inquisitor. She'd deliberately lured him out, killing and\ncontrolling his koloss, forcing him to reveal himself. Now she had to deal with him.\nShe whipped out a glass dagger—the Inquisitor would be able to Push away a koloss sword—and\nflared her pewter. Speed, strength, and poise flooded her body. Unfortunately, the Inquisitor would have\npewter as well, making them equal.\nExcept for one thing. The Inquisitor had a weakness. Vin ducked an axe swipe, Pulling on a koloss\nsword to give herself the speed to get out of the way. Then, she Pushed on the same weapon, throwing\nherself forward as she jabbed for the Inquisitor's neck. He fended her off with a swipe of the hand,\nblocking her dagger arm. But, with her other hand, she grabbed the side of his robe.\nThen she flared iron and Pulled behind her, yanking on a dozen different koloss swords at once. The\nsudden Pull propelled her backward. Steelpushes and Ironpulls were jolting, blunt things that had far\nmore power than subtlety. With pewter flared, Vin hung on to the robe, and the Inquisitor obviously\nstabilized himself by Pulling on koloss weapons in front of him.\nThe robe gave, ripping down the side, leaving Vin holding a wide section of cloth. The Inquisitor's\nback lay exposed, and she should have been able to see a single spike—similar to those in the\neyes—protruding from the creature's back. However, that spike was hidden by a metal shield that\ncovered the Inquisitor's back and ran underneath his arms and around his front. Like a formfitting\nbreastplate, it covered his back, something like a sleek turtle's shell.\nThe Inquisitor turned, smiling, and Vin cursed. That dorsal spike—driven directly between every\nInquisitor's shoulder blades—was their weakest point. Pulling it free would kill the creature. That,\nobviously, was the reason for the plate—something Vin suspected the Lord Ruler would have forbidden.\nHe had wanted his servants to have weaknesses, so that he could control them.\nVin didn't have much time for thought, for the koloss were still attacking.

Even as she landed, tossing\naside the ripped fabric, a large, blue-skinned monster swung at her. Vin jumped, cresting the sword as it\nswung beneath her, then Pushed against it to give herself some height.\nThe Inquisitor followed, now on the attack. Ash spun in the air currents around Vin as she bounded\nacross the battlefield, trying to think. The only other way she knew to kill an Inquisitor was to behead\nit—an act more easily contemplated than completed, considering that the fiend would be toughened by\npewter.\nShe let herself land on a deserted hill on the outskirts of the battlefield. The Inquisitor thumped to the\nashen earth behind her. Vin dodged an axe blade, trying to get in close enough to slash. But the Inquisitor\nswung with his other blade, and Vin took a gash in the arm as she turned the weapon aside with her\ndagger.\nWarm blood dribbled down her wrist. Blood the color of the red sun. She growled, facing down her\ninhuman opponent. Inquisitor smiles disturbed her. She threw herself forward, to strike again.\nSomething flashed in the air.\nBlue lines, moving quickly—the Allomantic indication of nearby bits of metal. Vin barely had time to\ntwist herself out of her attack as a handful of coins surprised the Inquisitor from behind, cutting into his\nbody in a dozen different places.\nThe creature screamed, spinning, throwing out drops of blood as Elend hit the ground atop the hill. His\nbrilliant white uniform was soiled with ash and blood, but his face was clean, his eyes bright. He carried a\ndueling cane in one hand, the other rested against the earth, steadying him from his Steeljump. His\nphysical Allomancy still lacked polish.\nYet, he was Mistborn, like Vin. And now the Inquisitor was wounded. Koloss were crowding around\nthe hill, clawing their way toward the top, but Vin and Elend still had a few moments. She dashed\nforward, raising her knife, and Elend attacked as well. The Inquisitor tried to watch both of them at once,\nits smile finally fading. It moved to jump away.\nElend flipped a coin into the air. A single, sparkling bit of copper spun through the flakes of ash. The\nInquisitor saw this, and smiled again, obviously anticipating Elend's Push. It assumed that its weight would\ntransfer through the coin, then hit Elend's weight, since Elend would be Pushing as well. Two\nAllomancers of near-similar weight, shoving against each other. They would both be thrown back—the\nInquisitor to attack Vin, Elend into a pile of koloss.\nExcept, the Inquisitor didn't anticipate Elend's Allomantic strength. How could it? Elend did stumble,\nbut the Inquisitor was thrown away with a sudden, violent Push.\nHe's so powerful! Vin thought, watching the surprised Inquisitor fall. Elend was no ordinary\nAllomancer—he might not have learned perfect control yet, but when he flared his metals and Pushed, he\ncould really Push.\nVin dashed forward to attack as the Inquisitor tried to reorient himself.

The creature blocked the swing with an arm, shattering\nthe wood, then ducked forward and rammed an elbow into Elend's chest. The emperor grunted.\nVin Pushed against the koloss who were now only a few feet away, shooting herself toward the\nInquisitor again. She'd dropped her knife—but, then, he'd also lost his axes. She could see him glancing\nto the side, toward where the weapons had fallen, but she didn't give him a chance to go for them. She\ntackled him, trying to throw him back to the ground. Unfortunately, he was much larger—and much\nstronger—than she was. He tossed her down in front of him, knocking the breath from her.\nThe koloss were upon them. But Elend had grabbed one of the fallen axes, and he struck for the\nInquisitor.\nThe Inquisitor moved with a sudden jolt of speed. Its form became a blur, and Elend swung only at\nempty air. Elend spun, shock showing on his face as the Inquisitor came up, wielding not an axe,\nbut—oddly—a metal spike, like the ones in his own body but sleeker and longer. The creature raised the\nspike, moving inhumanly fast—faster even than any Allomancer should have managed.\nThat was no pewter run, Vin thought. That wasn't even duralumin. She scrambled to her feet,\nwatching the Inquisitor. The creature's strange speed faded, but it was still in a position to hit Elend\ndirectly in the back with the spike. Vin was too far away to help.\nBut the koloss weren't. They were cresting the hill, mere feet from Elend and his opponent. Desperate,\nVin flared brass and grabbed the emotions of the koloss closest to the Inquisitor. Even as the Inquisitor\nmoved to attack Elend, her koloss spun, swinging its wedge-like sword, hitting the Inquisitor directly in\nthe face.\nIt didn't separate the head from the body. It just crushed the head completely. Apparently, that was\nsufficient, for the Inquisitor dropped without a sound, falling motionless.\nA shock ran through the koloss army.\n\"Elend!\" Vin said. \"Now!\"\nThe emperor turned away from the dying Inquisitor, and she could see the look of concentration on his\nface. Once, Vin had seen the Lord Ruler affect an entire city square full of people with his emotional\nAllomancy. He had been stronger than she was; far stronger—even—than Kelsier.\nShe couldn't see Elend burn duralumin, then brass, but she could feel it.

In the distance, Vin could make out the haggard remnants of Elend's peasant army,\nstanding in an exhausted circle of bodies. Ash continued to fall. It rarely stopped, these days.\nThe koloss lowered their weapons. Elend had won.\nThis is actually what happened to Rashek, I believe. He pushed too hard. He tried to burn away\nthe mists by moving the planet closer to the sun, but he moved it too far, making the world far too\nhot for the people who inhabited it.\nThe ashmounts were his solution to this. He had learned that shoving a planet around required\ntoo much precision, so instead he caused the mountains to erupt, spewing ash and smoke into the\nair. The thicker atmosphere made the world cooler, and turned the sun red.\n4\nSAZED, CHIEF AMBASSADOR OF THE NEW EMPIRE, studied the sheet of paper in front of\nhim. The tenets of the Canzi people, it read. On the beauty of mortality, the importance of death,\nand the vital function of the human body as a partaker of the divine whole.\nThe words were written in his own hand, copied out of one of his Feruchemical metalminds—where\nhe had storages containing literally thousands of books. Beneath the heading, filling most of the sheet in\ncramped writing, he had listed the basic beliefs of the Canzi and their religion.\nSazed settled back in his chair, holding up the paper and going over his notes one more time. He'd\nbeen focusing on this one religion for a good day now, and he wanted to make a decision about it. Even\nbefore the day's study, he'd known much about the Canzi faith, for he'd studied it—along with all of the\nother pre-Ascension religions—for most of his life. Those religions had been his passion, the focus of all\nof his research.\nAnd then the day had come where he'd realized that all of his learning had been meaningless.\nThe Canzi religion contradicts itself, he decided, making a notation with his pen at the side of the\npaper. It explains that all creatures are part of the \"divine whole\" and implies that each body is a\nwork of art created by a spirit who decides to live in this world.\nHowever, one of its other tenets is that the evil are punished with bodies that do not function\ncorrectly. A distasteful doctrine, in Sazed's mind. Those who were born with mental or physical\ndeficiencies deserved compassion, perhaps pity, but not disdain. Besides, which of the religion's ideals\nwere true? That spirits chose and designed their bodies as they wished, or that they were punished by the\nbody chosen for them? And what of the influence of lineage upon a child's features and temperament?\nHe nodded to himself, made a note at the bottom of the sheet of paper. Logically inconsistent.\nObviously untrue.\n\"What is that you have there?\" Breeze asked.\nSazed looked up. Breeze sat beside a small table, sipping his wine and eating grapes. He wore one of\nhis customary nobleman's suits, complete with a dark jacket, a bright red vest, and a dueling cane—with\nwhich he liked to gesture as he spoke.

He'd gained back most of the weight he'd lost during Luthadel's\nsiege and its aftermath, and could reasonably be described as \"portly\" once again.\nSazed looked down. He carefully placed the sheet alongside some hundred others inside his portfolio,\nthen closed the cloth-wrapped board cover and did up the ties. \"It is nothing of consequence, Lord\nBreeze,\" he said.\nBreeze sipped quietly at his wine. \"Nothing of consequence? You seem to always be puttering around\nwith those sheets of yours. Whenever you have a free moment, you pull one of them out.\"\nSazed set the portfolio beside his chair. How to explain? Each of the sheets in the thick portfolio\noutlined one of the over three hundred different religions the Keepers had collected. Each and every one\nof those religions was now effectively \"dead,\" as the Lord Ruler had stamped them out very early in his\nreign, some thousand years before.\nOne year ago, the woman Sazed loved had died. Now, he wanted to know . . . no, he had to know .\n. . if the religions of the world had answers for him. He would find the truth, or he would eliminate each\nand every faith.\nBreeze was still looking at him.\n\"I would rather not talk about it, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said.\n\"As you wish,\" Breeze said, raising his cup. \"Perhaps you could use your Feruchemist's powers to\nlisten in on the conversation happening in the next room . . .\"\n\"I do not think it would be polite to do so.\"\nBreeze smiled. \"My dear Terrisman—only you would come to conquer a city, then worry about being\n'polite' to the dictator you're threatening.\"\nSazed glanced down, feeling slightly abashed. But, he could not deny Breeze's remarks. Though the\ntwo of them had brought no army with them to Lekal City, they had indeed come to conquer. They\nsimply intended to do it with a piece of paper rather than a sword.\nIt all hinged on what was happening in the next room. Would the king sign the treaty or not? All\nBreeze and Sazed could do was wait. He itched to get his portfolio out, to look over the next religion in\nthe stack. He'd been considering the Canzi for over a day, and now that he'd made a decision about it,\nhe wished to move on to the next sheet. During the last year, he'd gotten through about two-thirds of the\nreligions. Barely a hundred remained, though the number was closer to two hundred if he took into\naccount all of the sub-sects and denominations.\nHe was close. Over the next few months, he'd be able to get through the rest of the religions. He\nwanted to give each one fair consideration. Surely, one of the remaining ones would strike him as\ncontaining the essence of truth he was searching for. Surely one of them would tell him what had\nhappened to Tindwyl's spirit without contradicting itself on a half-dozen different points.\nBut, for the moment, he felt self-conscious reading in front of Breeze. So, Sazed forced himself to sit\nand wait patiently.\nThe room around him was ornate, after the fashion of the old imperial nobility. Sazed wasn't used to"

        "text": "and wait patiently.\nThe room around him was ornate, after the fashion of the old imperial nobility. Sazed wasn't used to\nsuch finery, not anymore. Elend had sold or burned most of his lavish trappings—his people had needed\nfood and warmth during the winter. King Lekal hadn't done the same, it appeared, though perhaps that\nwas because the winters were less harsh here in the South.\nSazed glanced out the window beside his chair. Lekal City didn't have a true palace—it had been just\na country estate until about two years ago. The manor house, however, did have a nice view over the\ngrowing town—which was more of a large shantytown than it was a true city.\nStill, that shantytown controlled lands that were dangerously inside Elend's defensive perimeter. They\nneeded the security of King Lekal's allegiance. And so, Elend had sent a contingent—including Sazed,\nwho was his chief ambassador—to secure the loyalty of the Lekal king. That man deliberated in the next\nroom with his aides, trying to decide whether or not to accept the treaty—which would make them\nsubjects of Elend Venture.\nChief ambassador of the New Empire . . .\nSazed was not very fond of his title, for it implied that he was actually a citizen of the empire. His\npeople, the Terris people, had sworn to call no man master again. They had spent a thousand years being\noppressed, being bred like animals and turned into perfect, docile servants. Only with the fall of the Final\nEmpire had the Terris become free to rule themselves.\nSo far, the Terris people hadn't done a very good job of that. Of course, it didn't help that the Steel\nInquisitors had slaughtered the entire Terris ruling council, leaving Sazed's people without direction or\nleadership.\nIn a way, we're hypocrites anyway, he thought. The Lord Ruler was secretly a Terrisman. One of\nour own did those horrible things to us. What right do we have to insist on calling no foreigner\nmaster? It wasn't a foreigner that destroyed our people, our culture, and our religion.\nAnd so, Sazed served as Elend Venture's chief ambassador. Elend was a friend—a man Sazed\nrespected like few others. To Sazed's mind, even the Survivor himself hadn't possessed Elend Venture's\nstrength of character. The emperor hadn't tried to assume authority over the Terris people, even after he\nhad accepted the refugees into his lands. Sazed wasn't sure if his people were free or not, but they owed\nElend Venture a large debt. Sazed would gladly serve as the man's ambassador.\nEven if there were other things Sazed felt he should be doing. Such as leading his people.\nNo, Sazed thought, glancing at his portfolio. No. A man with no faith cannot lead them. I must find\nthe truth for myself first. If such a thing exists.\n\"It certainly is taking them long enough,\" Breeze said, eating a grape. \"One would think that after all the\ntalking we did to get to this point, they'd know by now whether they intended to sign the thing or not.\"\nSazed glanced toward the elaborately carved door on the other side of the room.

If we hadn't come to bully King Lekal, someone\nelse would have. It comes down to basic strategic necessity. Or, that's how I see it—perhaps I'm just\nmore calculating than others.\"\nSazed eyed the stocky man. Breeze was a Soother—in fact, he was the most brazen, flagrant Soother\nSazed had ever known. Most Soothers used their powers with discrimination and subtlety, nudging\nemotions only at the most opportune times. Breeze, however, played with everyone's emotions. Sazed\ncould feel the man's touch on his own feelings at that moment, in fact—though only because he knew\nwhat to look for.\n\"If you will excuse the observation, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said, \"you do not fool me as easily as you\nbelieve you do.\"\nBreeze raised an eyebrow.\n\"I know you are a good man,\" Sazed said. \"You work very hard to hide it. You make a great show of\nbeing callous and selfish. Yet, to those watching what you do and not just what you say, you become far\nmore transparent.\"\nBreeze frowned, and Sazed got a little stab of pleasure at surprising the Soother. He obviously hadn't\nexpected Sazed to be so blunt.\n\"My dear man,\" Breeze said, sipping his wine, \"I'm disappointed in you. Weren't you just speaking\nabout being polite? Well, it's not at all polite to point out a crusty old pessimist's dark inner secret.\"\n\"Dark inner secret?\" Sazed asked. \"That you're kindhearted?\"\n\"It's an attribute in myself that I've worked very hard to discourage,\" Breeze said lightly.\n\"Unfortunately, I prove too weak. Now, to completely divert us from this subject—which I find far too\ndiscomforting—I shall return to your earlier question. You ask if we are doing the right thing? Right thing\nhow? By forcing King Lekal to become a vassal to Elend?\"\nSazed nodded.\n\"Well then,\" Breeze said, \"I'd have to say that yes, we did the right thing. Our treaty will give Lekal the\nprotection of Elend's armies.\"\n\"At the cost of his own freedom to govern.\"\n\"Bah,\" Breeze said with a wave of his hand. \"We both know that Elend is a far better ruler than Lekal\ncould ever hope to be. Most of his people are living in half-finished shacks, for the Lord Ruler's sake!\"\n\"Yes, but you must admit that we bullied him.\"\nBreeze frowned. \"That's how all politics is. Sazed, this man's nephew sent an army of koloss to\ndestroy Luthadel! He's lucky Elend didn't just come down and wipe out the entire city in retribution. We\nhave bigger armies, more resources, and better Allomancers. This people will be far better off once"

You argued all these same points not two\ndays ago at the negotiating table.\"\n\"I apologize, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"I . . . seem to find myself feeling contrary of late.\"\nBreeze didn't respond at first. \"It still hurts, does it?\" he asked.\nThat man is far too good at understanding the emotions of others, Sazed thought. \"Yes,\" he finally\nwhispered.\n\"It will stop,\" Breeze said. \"Eventually.\"\nWill it? Sazed thought, looking away. It had been a year. It still felt . . . as if nothing would ever be\nright again. Sometimes, he wondered if his immersion in the religions was simply a way of hiding from his\npain.\nIf that were so, then he'd chosen a poor way to cope, for the pain was always there waiting for him.\nHe had failed. No, his faith had failed him. Nothing was left to him.\nIt was all. Just. Gone.\n\"Look,\" Breeze said, drawing his attention, \"sitting here and waiting for Lekal to make up his mind is\nobviously making us anxious. Why don't we talk about something else? How about telling me about one\nof those religions you have memorized. You haven't tried to convert me in months!\"\n\"I stopped wearing my copperminds nearly a year ago, Breeze.\"\n\"But surely you remember a bit,\" Breeze said. \"Why don't you try to convert me? You know, for old\ntimes' sake and all that.\"\n\"I don't think so, Breeze.\"\nIt felt like a betrayal. As a Keeper—a Terris Feruchemist—he could store memories inside of pieces\nof copper, then withdraw them later. During the time of the Final Empire, Sazed's kind had suffered much\nto gather their vast stores of information—and not just about religions. They had gathered every shred of\ninformation they could find about the time before the Lord Ruler. They'd memorized it, passed it on to\nothers, depending on their Feruchemy to maintain accuracy.\nYet they'd never found the one thing they sought most urgently, the thing that had begun their quest: the\nreligion of the Terris people. It had been erased by the Lord Ruler during the first century of his reign.\nStill, so many had died, worked, and bled so that Sazed could have the vast storages he'd inherited.\nAnd he had taken them off. After retrieving his notes about each religion, writing them down on the pages\nhe now carried in his portfolio, he'd removed each and every one of his metalminds and stored them\naway.\nThey just . . . didn't seem to matter anymore. At times, nothing did. He tried not to dwell too much on\nthat. But the thought lurked in his mind, terrible and impossible to banish. He felt tainted, unworthy. As\nfar as Sazed knew, he was the last living Feruchemist. They didn't have the resources to search right\nnow, but in a year's time, no Keeper refugees had made their way to Elend's domain.

There would be some small trace of it left in the Terris people, but given the Lord\nRuler's efforts to breed it away and the deaths of the Synod . . . things did not look good.\nThe metalminds remained packed away, carried along wherever he went, but never used. He doubted\nhe would ever draw upon them again.\n\"Well?\" Breeze asked, rising and walking over to lean against the window beside Sazed. \"Aren't you\ngoing to tell me about a religion? Which is it going to be? That religion where people made maps, maybe?\nThe one that worshipped plants? Surely you've got one in there that worships wine. That might fit me.\"\n\"Please, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said, looking out over the city. Ash was falling. It always did these days.\n\"I do not wish to speak of these things.\"\n\"What?\" Breeze asked. \"How can that be?\"\n\"If there were a God, Breeze,\" Sazed said, \"do you think he'd have let so many people be killed by the\nLord Ruler? Do you think he'd have let the world become what it is now? I will not teach you—or\nanyone—a religion that cannot answer my questions. Never again.\"\nBreeze fell silent.\nSazed reached down, touching his stomach. Breeze's comments pained him. They brought his mind\nback to that terrible time a year before, when Tindwyl had been killed. When Sazed had fought Marsh at\nthe Well of Ascension, and had nearly been killed himself. Even through his clothing, he could feel the\nscars on his abdomen, where Marsh had hit him with a collection of metal rings, piercing Sazed's skin and\nnearly killing him.\nHe'd drawn upon the Feruchemical power of those very rings to save his life, healing his body,\nengulfing them within him. Soon after, however, he'd stored up some health and then had a surgeon\nremove the rings from his body. Despite Vin's protests that having them inside him would be an\nadvantage, Sazed was worried that it was unhealthy to keep them embedded in his own flesh. Besides,\nhe had just wanted them gone.\nBreeze turned to look out the window. \"You were always the best of us, Sazed,\" he said quietly.\n\"Because you believed in something.\"\n\"I am sorry, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"I do not mean to disappoint you.\"\n\"Oh, you don't disappoint me,\" Breeze said. \"Because I don't believe what you've said. You're not\nmeant to be an atheist, Sazed. I have a feeling you'll be no good at it—doesn't suit you at all. You'll come\naround eventually.\"\nSazed looked back out the window. He was brash for a Terrisman, but he did not wish to argue\nfurther.\n\"I never did thank you,\" Breeze said.\n\"For what, Lord Breeze?\"\n\"For pulling me out of myself,\" Breeze said. \"For forcing me to get up, a year ago, and keep going.

If\nyou hadn't helped me, I don't know that I would ever have gotten over . . . what happened.\"\nSazed nodded. On the inside, however, his thoughts were more bitter. Yes, you saw destruction and\ndeath, my friend. But the woman you love is still alive. I could have come back too, if I hadn't lost\nher. I could have recovered, as you did.\nThe door opened.\nSazed and Breeze both turned. A solitary aide entered, bearing an ornate sheet of parchment. King\nLekal had signed the treaty at the bottom. His signature was small, almost cramped, in the large space\nallotted. He knew he was beaten.\nThe aide set the treaty on the table, then retreated.\nEach time Rashek tried to fix things, he made them worse. He had to change the world's plants to\nmake them able to survive in the new, harsh environment. Yet, that change left the plants less\nnutritious to mankind. Indeed, the falling ash would make men sick, causing them to cough like\nthose who spent too long mining beneath the earth. And so Rashek changed mankind itself as\nwell, altering them so that they could survive.\n5\nELEND KNELT BESIDE THE FALLEN INQUISITOR, trying to ignore the mess that was left of\nthe thing's head. Vin approached, and he noted the wound on her forearm. As usual, she all but ignored\nthe injury.\nThe koloss army stood quietly on the battlefield around them. Elend still wasn't comfortable with the\nidea of controlling the creatures. He felt . . . tainted by even associating with them. Yet, it was the only\nway.\n\"Something's wrong, Elend,\" Vin said.\nHe looked up from the body. \"What? You think there might be another one around?\"\nShe shook her head. \"Not that. That Inquisitor moved too quickly at the end. I've never seen a\nperson—Allomancer or not—with that kind of speed.\"\n\"He must have had duralumin,\" Elend said, looking down. For a time, he and Vin had held an edge,\nsince they'd had access to an Allomantic metal the Inquisitors hadn't known about. Reports now\nindicated that edge was gone.\nFortunately, they still had electrum. The Lord Ruler was to be thanked for that, actually. Poor man's\natium. Normally, an Allomancer who was burning atium was virtually invincible—only another\nAllomancer burning the metal could fight him. Unless, of course, one had electrum. Electrum didn't grant\nthe same invincibility as atium—which allowed an Allomancer to see slightly into the future—but it did\nmake one immune to atium.\n\"Elend,\" Vin said, kneeling, \"it wasn't duralumin. The Inquisitor was moving too quickly even for that.\"\nElend frowned. He had seen the Inquisitor move only out of the corner of his eye, but surely it hadn't\nbeen that fast. Vin had a tendency to be paranoid and assume the worst.\nOf course, she also had a habit of being right."

Vin had a tendency to be paranoid and assume the worst.\nOf course, she also had a habit of being right.\nShe reached out and grabbed the front of the corpse's robe, ripping it free. Elend turned away. \"Vin!\nHave respect for the dead!\"\n\"I have no respect for these things,\" she said, \"nor will I ever. Did you see how that thing tried to use\none of its spikes to kill you?\"\n\"That was odd. Perhaps he felt he couldn't get to the axes in time.\"\n\"Here, look.\"\nElend glanced back. The Inquisitor had the standard spikes—three pounded between the ribs on each\nside of the chest. But . . . there was another one—one Elend hadn't seen in any other Inquisitor\ncorpse—pounded directly through the front of this creature's chest.\nLord Ruler! Elend thought. That one would have gone right through its heart. How did it\nsurvive? Of course, if two spikes through the brain didn't kill it, then one through the heart probably\nwouldn't either.\nVin reached down and yanked the spike free. Elend winced. She held it up, frowning. \"Pewter,\" she\nsaid.\n\"Really?\" Elend asked.\nShe nodded. \"That makes ten spikes. Two through the eyes and one through the shoulders: all steel.\nSix through the ribs: two steel, four bronze. Now this, a pewter one—not to mention the one he tried to\nuse on you, which appears to be steel.\"\nElend studied the spike in her hand. In Allomancy and Feruchemy, different metals did different\nthings—he could only guess that for Inquisitors, the type of metal used in the various spikes was\nimportant as well. \"Perhaps they don't use Allomancy at all, but some . . . third power.\"\n\"Maybe,\" Vin said, gripping the spike, standing up. \"We'll need to cut open the stomach and see if it\nhad atium.\"\n\"Maybe this one will finally have some.\" They always burned electrum as a precaution; so far, none of\nthe Inquisitors they'd met had actually possessed any atium.\nVin shook her head, staring out over the ash-covered battlefield. \"We're missing something, Elend.\nWe're like children, playing a game we've watched our parents play, but not really knowing any of the\nrules. And . . . our opponent created the game in the first place.\"\nElend stepped around the corpse, moving over to her. \"Vin, we don't even known that it's out there.\nThe thing we saw a year ago at the Well . . . perhaps it's gone. Perhaps it left, now that it's free. That\ncould be all it wanted.\"\nVin looked at him. He could read in her eyes that she didn't believe that. Perhaps she saw that he\ndidn't really believe it either.\n\"It's out there, Elend,\" she whispered. \"It's directing the Inquisitors; it knows what we're doing. That's\nwhy the koloss always move against the same cities we do. It has power over the world—it can change\ntext that has been written, create miscommunications and confusion. It knows our plans.\"\nElend put a hand on her shoulder. \"But today we beat it—and, it sent us this handy koloss army.\""

It knows our plans.\"\nElend put a hand on her shoulder. \"But today we beat it—and, it sent us this handy koloss army.\"\n\"And how many humans did we lose trying to capture this force?\"\nElend didn't need to speak the answer. Too many. Their numbers were dwindling. The mists—the\nDeepness—were growing more powerful, choking the life from random people, killing the crops of the\nrest. The Outer Dominances were wastelands—only those closest to the capital, Luthadel, still got\nenough daylight to grow food. And even that area of livability was shrinking.\nHope, Elend thought forcefully. She needs that from me; she's always needed that from me. He\ntightened his grip on her shoulder, then pulled her into an embrace. \"We'll beat it, Vin. We'll find a way.\"\nShe didn't contradict him, but she obviously wasn't convinced. Still, she let him hold her, closing her\neyes and resting her head against his chest. They stood on the battlefield before their fallen foe, but even\nElend had to admit that it didn't feel like much of a victory. Not with the world collapsing around them.\nHope! he thought again. I belong to the Church of the Survivor, now. It has only one prime\ncommandment.\nSurvive.\n\"Give me one of the koloss,\" Vin finally said, pulling out of the embrace.\nElend released one of the medium-large creatures, letting Vin take control of it. He still didn't quite\nunderstand how they controlled the creatures. Once he had control of a koloss, he could control it\nindefinitely—whether sleeping or awake, burning metals or not. There were many things he didn't\nunderstand about Allomancy. He'd had only a year to use his powers, and he had been distracted by\nruling an empire and trying to feed his people, not to mention the wars. He'd had little time for practice.\nOf course, Vin had less time than that to practice before she killed the Lord Ruler himself. Vin,\nhowever, was a special case. She used Allomancy as easily as other people breathed; it was less a skill\nto her than an extension of who she was. Elend might be more powerful—as she always insisted—but\nshe was the true master.\nVin's lone koloss wandered over and picked up the fallen Inquisitor and the spike. Then, Elend and\nVin walked down the hill—Vin's koloss servant following—toward the human army. The koloss troops\nsplit and made a passage at Elend's command. He suppressed a shiver even as he controlled them.\nFatren, the dirty man who ruled the city, had thought to set up a triage unit—though Elend wasn't very\nconfident in the abilities of a group of skaa surgeons.\n\"Why'd they stop?\" Fatren asked, standing in front of his men as Vin and Elend approached across the\nash-stained ground\n\"I promised you a second army, Lord Fatren,\" Elend said. \"Well, here it is.\"\n\"The koloss?\" he asked.\nElend nodded.\n\"But they're the army that came to destroy us.\"\n\"And now they're ours,\" Elend said. \"Your men did very well.

Make certain they understand that this\nvictory was theirs. We had to force that Inquisitor out into the open, and the only way to do that was to\nturn his army against itself. Koloss become afraid when they see something small defeating something\nlarge. Your men fought bravely; because of them, these koloss are ours.\"\nFatren scratched his chin. \"So,\" he said slowly, \"they got afraid of us, so they switched sides?\"\n\"Something like that,\" Elend said, looking over the soldiers. He mentally commanded some koloss to\nstep forward. \"These creatures will obey orders from the men in this group. Have them carry your\nwounded back to the city. However, make certain not to let your men attack or punish the koloss. They\nare our servants now, understand?\"\nFatren nodded.\n\"Let's go,\" Vin said, eagerness sounding in her voice as she looked over at the small city.\n\"Lord Fatren, do you want to come with us, or do you want to supervise your men?\" Elend asked.\nFatren's eyes narrowed. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\"There is something in your city we need to claim.\"\nFatren paused. \"I'll come, then.\" He gave some orders to his men while Vin waited impatiently. Elend\ngave her a smile, then finally Fatren joined them, and the three walked back toward the Vetitan gate.\n\"Lord Fatren,\" Elend said as they walked, \"you should address me as 'my lord' from now on.\"\nFatren looked up from his nervous study of the koloss standing around them.\n\"Do you understand?\" Elend said, meeting the man's eyes.\n\"Um . . . yes. My lord.\"\nElend nodded, and Fatren fell a little behind him and Vin, as if showing an unconscious deference. He\ndidn't seem rebellious—for now, he was probably happy to be alive. Perhaps he would eventually resent\nElend for taking command of his city, but by then, there would be little he could do. Fatren's people\nwould be accustomed to the security of being part of a larger empire, and the stories of Elend's\nmysterious command of the koloss—and therefore salvation of the city—would be too strong. Fatren\nwould never rule again.\nSo easily I command, Elend thought. Just two years ago, I made even more mistakes than this\nman. At least he managed to keep his city's people together in a time of crisis. I lost my throne,\nuntil Vin conquered it back for me.\n\"I worry about you,\" Vin asked. \"Did you have to start the battle without me?\"\nElend glanced to the side. There was no reproach in her voice. Just concern.\n\"I wasn't sure when—or even if—you'd arrive,\" he said. \"The opportunity was just too good. The\nkoloss had just marched an entire day. We probably killed five hundred before they even decided to start\nattacking.\"\n\"And the Inquisitor?\" Vin asked. \"Did you really think you could take him on your own?\"\n\"Did you?\" Elend asked. \"You fought him for a good five minutes before I was able to get there and\nhelp.\""

        "text": "\"Did you?\" Elend asked. \"You fought him for a good five minutes before I was able to get there and\nhelp.\"\nVin didn't use the obvious argument—that she was by far the more accomplished Mistborn. Instead,\nshe just walked silently. She still worried about him, even though she no longer tried to protect him from\nall danger. Both her worry and her willingness to let him take risks were part of her love for him. And he\nsincerely appreciated both.\nThe two of them tried to stay together as much as possible, but that wasn't always feasible—such as\nwhen Elend had discovered a koloss army marching on an indefensible city while Vin was away\ndelivering orders to Penrod in Luthadel. Elend had hoped she would return to his army camp in time to\nfind out where he had gone, then come help, but he hadn't been able to wait. Not with thousands of lives\nat stake.\nThousands of lives . . . and more.\nThey eventually reached the gates. A crowd of soldiers who had either arrived late to the battle or\nbeen too afraid to charge stood atop the bulwark, looking down with awe. Several thousand koloss had\ngotten past Elend's men and tried to attack the city. These now stood motionless—by his silent\ncommand—waiting outside the bulwark.\nThe soldiers opened the gates, letting in Vin, Elend, Fatren, and Vin's single koloss servant. Most of\nthem eyed Vin's koloss with distrust—as well they should. She ordered it to put down the dead\nInquisitor, then made it follow as the three of them walked down the ash-piled city street. Vin had a\nphilosophy: the more people who saw koloss and grew accustomed to the creatures, the better. It made\nthe people less frightened of the beasts, and made it easier to fight should they have to face koloss in\nbattle.\nThey soon approached the Ministry building that Elend had first inspected upon entering the city. Vin's\nkoloss walked forward and began to rip the boards off of its doors.\n\"The Ministry building?\" Fatren said. \"What good is it? We already searched it.\"\nElend eyed him.\n\"My lord,\" Fatren said belatedly.\n\"The Steel Ministry was linked directly to the Lord Ruler,\" Elend said. \"Its obligators were his eyes\nacross the empire, and through them he controlled the nobility, watched over commerce, and made\ncertain that orthodoxy was maintained.\"\nThe koloss yanked the door open. Moving inside, Elend burned tin, enhancing his eyesight so that he\ncould see in the dim light. Vin, obviously doing the same, had little trouble picking her way across the\nbroken boards and furniture littering the floor. Apparently, Fatren's people hadn't just \"searched\" the\nplace—they'd ransacked it.\n\"Yeah, I know about obligators,\" Fatren said. \"There aren't any of them here, my lord. They left with\nthe nobility.\"\n\"The obligators saw to some very important projects, Fatren,\" Elend said. \"Things like trying to\ndiscover how to use new Allomantic metals, or like searching for lines of Terris blood that were breeding\ntrue. One of their projects is of particular interest to us.\"\n\"Here,\" Vin said, calling out from beside something set in the floor. A hidden trapdoor."

        "text": "true. One of their projects is of particular interest to us.\"\n\"Here,\" Vin said, calling out from beside something set in the floor. A hidden trapdoor.\nFatren glanced back toward the sunlight, perhaps wishing that he'd decided to bring a few soldiers\nwith him. Beside the trapdoor, Vin lit a lantern she'd salvaged from somewhere. In the blackness of a\nbasement, even tin wouldn't provide sight. Vin opened the trapdoor, and they made their way down the\nladder. It eventually ended in a wine cellar.\nElend walked to the center of the small cellar, surveying it as Vin began to check the walls. \"I found it,\"\nshe said a second later, rapping her fist on a certain portion of the stone block wall. Elend walked\nforward, joining her. Sure enough, there was a thin slit in the stones, barely visible. Burning steel, Elend\ncould see two faint blue lines pointing to metal plates hidden behind the stone. Two stronger lines pointed\nbehind him, toward a large metal plate set into the wall, affixed very securely with enormous bolts bored\ninto the stone.\n\"Ready?\" Vin asked.\nElend nodded, flaring his iron. They both Pulled on the plate buried in the stone wall, steadying\nthemselves by Pulling back against the plates on the back wall.\nNot for the first time, the foresight of the Ministry impressed Elend. How could they have known that\nsomeday, a group of skaa would take control of this city? And yet, this door had not only been\nhidden—it had been crafted so that only someone with Allomancy could open it. Elend continued to Pull\nin both directions at once, feeling as if his body were being stretched between two horses. But,\nfortunately, he had the power of pewter to strengthen his body and keep it from ripping apart. Vin\ngrunted in effort beside him, and soon a section of the wall began to slide open toward them. No amount\nof prying would have been able to wedge the thick stone open, and only a lengthy, arduous effort would\nhave been enough to break through. Yet, with Allomancy, they opened the door in a matter of moments.\nFinally, they let go. Vin exhaled in exhaustion, and Elend could tell that it had been more difficult for\nher than it was for him. Sometimes, he didn't feel justified in having more power than she—after all, he'd\nbeen an Allomancer for far less time.\nVin picked up her lantern, and they moved into the now-open room. Like the other two Elend had\nseen, this cavern was enormous. It extended into the distance, their lantern's light making only a faint dent\nin the blackness. Fatren gasped in wonder as he joined them in the doorway. The room was filled with\nshelves. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them.\n\"What is it?\" Fatren asked.\n\"Food,\" Elend said. \"And basic supplies. Medicines, cloth, water.\"\n\"So much,\" Fatren said. \"Here, all along . . .\"\n\"Go get more men,\" Elend said. \"Soldiers. We'll need them to guard the entrance, to keep people from\nbreaking in and stealing the contents.\"\nFatren's face hardened. \"This place belongs to my people.\""

There's a difference.\"\n\"I don't see one.\"\nElend gritted his teeth to keep himself from snapping at the man—the fatigue, the draining effect of\nleading an empire that seemed doomed—put him on edge so often lately. No, he told himself. Men like\nFatren need more than another tyrant. They need someone to look up to.\nElend approached the man, and intentionally didn't use emotional Allomancy on him. Soothing was\neffective in many situations, but it wore off quickly. It was not a method to make permanent allies.\n\"Lord Fatren,\" Elend said. \"I want you to think carefully about what you're arguing for. What would\nhappen if I did leave you? With this much food, this much wealth down here? Can you trust your people\nnot to break in, your soldiers not to try selling some of this to other cities? What happens when the secret\nof your food supply gets out? Will you welcome the thousands of refugees who will come? Will you\nprotect them, and this cavern, against the raiders and bandits who will follow?\"\nFatren fell silent.\nElend laid a hand on the man's shoulder. \"I meant what I said above, Lord Fatren. Your people fought\nwell—I was very impressed. They owe their survival today to you—your foresight, your training. Mere\nhours ago, they assumed they would be slaughtered by koloss. Now, they are not only safe, but under\nthe protection of a much larger army.\n\"Don't fight this. You've struggled well, but it is time to have allies. I won't lie to you—I'm going to take\nthe contents of this cavern, whether you resist me or not. However, I intend to give you the protection of\nmy armies, the stability of my food supplies, and my word of honor that you can continue to rule your\npeople under me. We need to work together, Lord Fatren. That's the only way any of us are going to\nsurvive the next few years.\"\nFatren looked up. \"You're right, of course,\" he said. \"I'll go get those men you asked for, my lord.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Elend said. \"And, if you have anyone who can write, send them to me. We'll need to\ncatalogue what we have down here.\"\nFatren nodded, then left.\n\"Once, you couldn't do things like that,\" Vin said from a short distance away, her voice echoing in the\nlarge cavern.\n\"Like what?\"\n\"Give a man such forceful commands,\" she said. \"Take control away from him.

He hadn't used emotional\nAllomancy, and yet he felt as if he'd bullied Fatren anyway. \"Sometimes, I feel like a failure, Vin. There\nshould be another way.\"\n\"Not right now, there isn't,\" Vin said, walking up to him, putting a hand on his arm. \"They need you,\nElend. You know that they do.\"\nHe nodded. \"I know it.

You have to be realistic, Elend.\"\n\"When my friends and I met together, I was the one who spoke of the perfect dreams, of the great\nthings we'd accomplish. I was always the idealist.\"\n\"Emperors don't have that luxury,\" Vin said quietly.\nElend looked at her, then sighed, turning away.\nVin stood, watching Elend in the cold lantern-light of the cavern. She hated seeing such regret, such . . .\ndisillusionment in him. In a way, his current problems seemed even worse than the self-doubt he had once\nstruggled with. He seemed to see himself as a failure despite what he had accomplished.\nAnd yet, he didn't let himself wallow in that failure. He moved on, working despite his regret. He was a\nharder man than he had once been. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing. The old Elend had been a man\nwho was easily dismissed by many—a genius who had wonderful ideas, but little ability to lead. Still, she\nmissed some of what was gone. The simple idealism. Elend was still an optimist, and he was still a\nscholar, but both attributes seemed tempered by what he had been forced to endure.\nShe watched him move along one of the storage shelves, trailing a finger in the dust. He brought the\nfinger up, looking at it for a moment, then snapped it, throwing a small burst of dust into the air. The\nbeard made him look more rugged—like the wartime commander he had become. A year of solid\ntraining with Allomancy and the sword had strengthened his body, and he'd needed to get his uniforms\nretailored to fit properly. The one he wore now was still stained from battle.\n\"This place is amazing, isn't it?\" Elend asked.\nVin turned, glancing into the darkness of the storage cavern. \"I suppose.\"\n\"He knew, Vin,\" Elend said. \"The Lord Ruler. He suspected that this day would come—a day when\nthe mists returned and food would be scarce. So, he prepared these supply depots.\"\nVin joined Elend beside a shelf.

Even a dying beast will still keep fighting, will do anything to stay alive.\"\n\"You have to admit that these caverns are a good sign, though,\" Elend said.\n\"A good sign?\" Vin asked quietly, stepping closer. \"Elend, I know you're just trying to find hope in all\nthis, but I have trouble seeing 'good signs' anywhere lately. You have to admit now that the sun is getting\ndarker. Redder. It's even worse down here, in the South.\"\n\"Actually,\" Elend said, \"I doubt that the sun has changed at all. It must be all the smoke and ash in the\nair.\"\n\"Which is another problem,\" Vin said. \"The ash falls almost perpetually now. People are having trouble\nkeeping it out of their streets. It blots out the light, making everything darker. Even if the mists don't kill\noff next year's crops, the ash will. Two winters ago—when we fought the koloss at Luthadel—was the\nfirst I'd seen snow in the Central Dominance, and this last winter was even worse. These aren't things we\ncan fight, Elend, no matter how big our army!\"\n\"What do you expect me to do, Vin?\" Elend asked, slamming his can of stew down on the shelf. \"The\nkoloss are gathering in the Outer Dominances. If we don't build our defenses, our people won't last long\nenough to starve.\"\nVin shook her head. \"Armies are short-term. This,\" she said, sweeping her hand across the cavern. \"\nThis is short-term. What are we doing here?\"\n\"We're surviving. Kelsier said—\"\n\"Kelsier is dead, Elend!\" Vin snapped. \"Am I the only one who sees the irony in that? We call him the\nSurvivor, but he is the one who didn't survive! He let himself become a martyr. He committed suicide.\nHow is that surviving?\"\nShe stood for a moment, looking at Elend, breathing deeply. He stared back, apparently undaunted by\nher outburst.\nWhat am I doing? Vin thought. I was just thinking about how much I admired Elend's hope. Why\nargue with him now?"

Both of them.\n\"I don't have answers for you, Vin,\" Elend said in the dark cavern. \"I can't even begin to understand\nhow to fight something like the mist. Armies, however, I can deal with. Or, at least, I'm learning how.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" Vin said, turning away. \"I didn't mean to argue again. It's just so frustrating.\"\n\"We're making progress,\" Elend said. \"We'll find a way, Vin. We'll survive.\"\n\"Do you really think we can do it?\" Vin asked, turning to look him in the eyes.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said.\nAnd she believed him. He had hope, and always would. That was a big part of why she loved him so\nmuch.\n\"Come on,\" Elend said, laying a hand on her shoulder. \"Let's find what we came for.\"\nVin joined him, leaving her koloss behind, walking into the depths of the cavern as they heard\nfootsteps outside. There was more than one reason they had come to this place. The food and the\nsupplies—of which they passed seemingly endless shelves—were important. However, there was more.\nA large metal plate was set into the back wall of the rough-hewn cavern. Vin read the words inscribed\non it out loud.\n\" 'This is the last metal I will tell you about,' \" she read. \" 'I have trouble deciding the purpose of it. It\nallows you to see the past, in a way. What a person could have been, and who they might have become,\nhad they made different choices. Much like gold, but for others.\n\" 'By now, the mists have likely come again. Such a foul, hateful thing. Scorn it. Don't go out in it. It\nseeks to destroy us all. If there is trouble, know that you can control the koloss and the kandra by use of\nseveral people Pushing on their emotions at once. I built this weakness into them. Keep the secret\nwisely.' \"\nBeneath that was listed an Allomantic compound of metals, one with which Vin was already familiar. It\nwas the alloy of atium they called malatium—Kelsier's Eleventh Metal. So the Lord Ruler had known\nabout it. He'd simply been as baffled as the rest of them as to its purpose.\nThe plate had been written by the Lord Ruler, of course. Or, at least, he'd ordered it written as it was.\nEach previous cache had also contained information, written in steel. In Urteau, for instance, she had\nlearned about electrum. In the one to the east, they'd found a description of aluminum—though they'd\nalready known about that metal.\n\"Not much new there,\" Elend said, sounding disappointed. \"We already knew about malatium and\nabout controlling koloss. Though, I'd never thought to have several Soothers Push at the same time. That\nmight be helpful.\" Before, they'd thought it took a Mistborn burning duralumin to get control of koloss.\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Vin said, pointing at the other side of the plate. \"We have that.\""

It depicted the Final Empire, divided into dominances. Luthadel was a\nsquare at the center. An \"X\" to the east marked the main thing they'd come looking for: the location of the\nfinal cavern.\nThere were five, they thought. They'd found the first one beneath Luthadel, near the Well of\nAscension. It had given the location of the second, to the east. The third had been in Urteau—Vin had\nbeen able to sneak into that one, but they hadn't managed to recover the food yet. That one had led them\nhere, to the south.\nEach map had two numbers on it—a five and a lower number. Luthadel had been number one. This\none was number four.\n\"That's it,\" Vin said, running her fingers along the carved inscriptions on the plate. \"In the Western\nDominance, as you guessed. Somewhere near Chardees?\"\n\"Fadrex City,\" Elend said.\n\"Cett's home?\"\nElend nodded. He knew far more about geography than she.\n\"That's the place, then,\" Vin said. \"The one where it is.\"\nElend met her eyes, and she knew he understood her. The caches had grown progressively larger and\nmore valuable. Each one had a specialized aspect to it as well—the first had contained weapons in\naddition to its other supplies, while the second had contained large amounts of lumber. As they'd\ninvestigated each successive cache, they'd grown more and more excited about what the last one might\ncontain. Something spectacular, surely. Perhaps even it.\nThe Lord Ruler's atium cache.\nIt was the most valuable treasure in the Final Empire. Despite years of searching, nobody had ever\nlocated it. Some said it didn't even exist. But, Vin felt that it had to. Despite a thousand years of\ncontrolling the sole mine that produced the extremely rare metal, he had allowed only a small portion of\natium to enter the economy. Nobody knew what the Lord Ruler had done with the greater portion he\nhad kept to himself for all those centuries.\n\"Now, don't get too excited,\" Elend said. \"We have no proof that we'll find the atium in that final\ncavern.\"\n\"It has to be there,\" Vin said. \"It makes sense. Where else would the Lord Ruler store his atium?\"\n\"If I could answer that, we'd have found it.\"\nVin shook her head. \"He put it somewhere safe, but somewhere where it would eventually be found.\nHe left these maps as clues to his followers, should he—somehow—be defeated. He didn't want an\nenemy who captured one of the caverns to be able to find them all instantly.\"\nA trail of clues that led to one, final cache. The most important one. It made sense. It had to. Elend\ndidn't look convinced. He rubbed his bearded chin, studying the reflective plate in their lantern light.\n\"Even if we find it,\" he said, \"I don't know that it will help that much. What good is money to us now?\""

A weapon we can use to fight.\"\n\"Fight the mists?\" he asked.\nVin fell silent. \"Perhaps not,\" she finally said. \"But the koloss, and the other armies. With that atium,\nyour empire becomes secure. . . . Plus, atium is part of all this, Elend. It's only valuable because of\nAllomancy—but Allomancy didn't exist until the Ascension.\"\n\"Another unanswered question,\" Elend said. \"Why did that nugget of metal I ingested make me\nMistborn? Where did it come from? Why was it placed at the Well of Ascension, and by whom? Why\nwas there only one left, and what happened to the others?\"\n\"Maybe we'll find the answer once we take Fadrex,\" Vin said.\nElend nodded. She could tell he considered the information contained in the caches the most important\nreason to track them down, followed closely by the supplies. To him, the possibility of finding atium was\nrelatively unimportant. Vin couldn't explain why she felt he was so wrong in this regard. The atium was\nimportant. She just knew it. Her earlier despair lightened as she looked over the map. They had to go to\nFadrex. She knew it.\nThe answers would be there.\n\"Taking Fadrex won't be easy,\" Elend noted. \"Cett's enemies have entrenched themselves quite solidly\nthere. I hear a former Ministry obligator is in charge.\"\n\"The atium will be worth it,\" Vin said.\n\"If it's there,\" Elend said.\nShe gave him a flat stare.\nHe held up a hand. \"I'm just trying to do what you told me, Vin—I'm trying to be realistic. However, I\nagree that Fadrex will be worth the effort. Even if the atium isn't there, we need the supplies in that store.\nWe need to know what the Lord Ruler left us.\"\nVin nodded. She herself no longer had any atium. She'd burned up their last bit a year and a half ago,\nand she'd never gotten used to how exposed she felt without it. Electrum softened that fear somewhat,\nbut not completely.\nVoices sounded from the other end of the cavern, and Elend turned. \"I should go speak to them,\" he\nsaid. \"We're going to have to organize things in here quickly.\"\n\"Have you told them yet that we're going to have to move them back to Luthadel?\"\nElend shook his head. \"They won't like it,\" he said. \"They're becoming independent, as I always hoped\nthey would.\"\n\"It has to be done, Elend,\" Vin said. \"This city is well outside our defensive perimeter. Plus, they can't\nhave more than a few hours of mistless daylight left this far out. Their crops are already doomed.\"\nElend nodded, but he continued to stare out into the darkness. \"I come, I seize control of their city,\ntake their treasure, then force them to abandon their homes. And from here we go to Fadrex to conquer\nanother.\"\n\"Elend—\""

It must be done.\" He turned, leaving the lantern and walking toward\nthe doorway. As he did, his posture straightened, and his face became more firm.\nVin turned back to the plate, rereading the Lord Ruler's words. On a different plate, much like this\none, Sazed had found the words of Kwaan, the long-dead Terrisman who had changed the world by\nclaiming to have found the Hero of Ages. Kwaan had left his words as a confession of his errors, warning\nthat some kind of force was working to change the histories and religions of mankind. He'd worried that\nthe force was suborning the Terris religion in order to cause a \"Hero\" to come to the North and release it.\nThat was exactly what Vin had done. She'd called herself hero, and had released the enemy—all the\nwhile thinking that she was sacrificing her own needs for the good of the world.\nShe ran her fingers across the large plate.\nWe have to do more than just fight wars! she thought, angry at the Lord Ruler. If you knew so\nmuch, why didn't you leave us more than this? A few maps in scattered halls filled with supplies?\nA couple of paragraphs, telling us about metals that are of barely any use? What good is a cave\nfull of food when we have an entire empire to feed!\nVin stopped. Her fingers—made far more sensitive by the tin she was burning to help her eyesight in\nthe dark cavern—brushed against grooves in the plate's surface. She knelt, leaning close, to find a short\ninscription carved in the metal, at the bottom, the letters much smaller than the ones up above.\nBe careful what you speak, it read. It can hear what you say. It can read what you write. Only\nyour thoughts are safe.\nVin shivered.\nOnly your thoughts are safe.\nWhat had the Lord Ruler learned in his moments of transcendence? What things had he kept in his\nmind forever, never writing them down for fear of revealing his knowledge, always expecting that he\nwould eventually be the one who took the power when it came again? Had he, perhaps, planned to use\nthat power to destroy the thing that Vin had released?\nYou have doomed yourselves. . . . The Lord Ruler's last words, spoken right before Vin had thrust\nthe spear through his heart. He'd known. Even then—before the mists had started coming during the day,\nbefore she'd begun hearing the strange thumpings that led her to the Well of Ascension—even then, she'd\nworried.\nBe careful what you speak . . . only your thoughts are safe.\nI have to figure this out. I have to connect what we have, find the way to defeat—or\noutwit—this thing that I've loosed.\nAnd I can't talk this over with anyone, or it will know what I'm planning.\nRashek soon found a balance in the changes he made to the world—which was fortunate, for his\npower burned away quite quickly. Though the power he held seemed immense to him, it was truly\nonly a tiny fraction of something much greater.\nOf course, he did end up naming himself the \"Sliver of Infinity\" in his religion.

Perhaps he\nunderstood more than I give him credit for.\nEither way, we had him to thank for a world without flowers, where plants grew brown rather\nthan green, and where people could survive in an environment where ash fell from the sky on a\nregular basis.\n6\nI'M TOO WEAK, Marsh thought.\nLucidity came upon him suddenly, as it often did when Ruin wasn't watching him closely. It was like\nwaking from a nightmare, fully aware of what had been going on in the dream, yet confused as to the\nreasoning behind his actions.\nHe continued to walk through the koloss camp. Ruin still controlled him, as it always did. Yet, when it\ndidn't press hard enough against Marsh's mind—when it didn't focus on him—sometimes, Marsh's own\nthoughts returned.\nI can't fight it, he thought. Ruin couldn't read his thoughts, of that he was fairly confident. And yet,\nMarsh couldn't fight or struggle in any way. When he did, Ruin immediately asserted control once again.\nThis had been proven to Marsh a dozen times over. Sometimes he managed to quiver a finger, perhaps\nhalt a step, but that was the best he could do.\nIt was depressing. However, Marsh had always considered himself to be a practical man, and he\nforced himself to acknowledge the truth. He was never going to gain enough control over his body to kill\nhimself.\nAsh fell as he walked through the camp. Did it ever stop these days? He almost wished that Ruin\nwouldn't ever let go of his mind. When his mind was his own, Marsh saw only pain and destruction.\nWhen Ruin controlled him, however, the falling ash was a thing of beauty, the red sun a marvelous\ntriumph, the world a place of sweetness in its death.\nMadness, Marsh thought, approaching the center of camp. I need to go mad. Then I won't have to\ndeal with all of this.\nOther Inquisitors joined him at the center of the camp, walking with quiet swishes of their robes. They\ndidn't speak. They never spoke—Ruin controlled them all, so why bother with conversation? Marsh's\nbrethren had the normal spikes in their heads, driven into the skull. Yet, he could also see telltale signs of\nthe new spikes, jutting from their chests and backs. Marsh had placed many of them himself, killing the\nTerrismen that had either been captured in the north or tracked down across the land.\nMarsh himself had a new set of spikes, some driven between the ribs, others driven down through the\nchest. They were a beautiful thing. He didn't understand why, but they excited him. The spikes had come\nthrough death, and that was pleasant enough—but there was more. He knew, somehow, that the\nInquisitors had been incomplete—the Lord Ruler had withheld some abilities to make the Inquisitors\nmore dependent upon him. To make certain they couldn't threaten him. But now, what he'd kept back\nhad been provided.\nWhat a beautiful world, Marsh thought, looking up into the falling ash, feeling the light, comforting\nflakes upon his skin.\nI speak of us as \"we.\" The group. Those of us who were trying to discover and defeat Ruin."

Those of us who were trying to discover and defeat Ruin.\nPerhaps my thoughts are now tainted, but I like to look back and see the sum of what we were\ndoing as a single, united assault, though we were all involved in different processes and plans.\nWe were one. That didn't stop the world from ending, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n7\nTHEY GAVE HIM BONES.\nTenSoon flowed around them, dissolving muscles, then re-forming them into organs, sinew, and skin.\nHe built a body around the bones, using skills gained over centuries spent eating and digesting humans.\nCorpses only, of course—he had never killed a man. The Contract forbade such things.\nAfter a year in his pit of a prison, he felt as if he had forgotten how to use a body. What was it like to\ntouch the world with rigid digits, rather than a body that flowed against the confines of stone? What was\nit like to taste and smell with only tongue and nostrils, rather than with every bit of skin exposed to the air.\nWhat was it like to . . .\nTo see. He opened his eyes and gasped, drawing first breath into remade, full-sized lungs. The world\nwas a thing of wonder and of . . . light. He had forgotten that, during the months of near madness. He\npushed himself to his knees, looking down at his arms. Then, he reached up, feeling his face with a\ntentative hand.\nHis body wasn't that of any specific person—he would have needed a model to produce such a\nreplica. Instead, he had covered the bones with muscles and skin as best he could. He was old enough\nthat he knew how to create a reasonable approximation of a human. The features wouldn't be handsome;\nthey might even be a little grotesque. That, however, was more than good enough for the moment. He felt\n. . . real again.\nStill on hands and knees, he looked up at his captor. The cavern was lit only by a glowstone—a large,\nporous rock set atop a thick column base. The bluish fungus that grew on the rock made enough of a\nglow to see by—especially if one had specifically grown eyes that were good at seeing in dim blue light.\nTenSoon knew his captor. He knew most kandra, at least up to the Sixth and Seventh Generations.\nThis kandra's name was VarSell. In the Homeland, VarSell didn't wear the bones of an animal or human,\nbut instead used a True Body—a set of false bones, human-shaped, crafted by a kandra artisan.\nVarSell's True Body was quartz, and he left his skin translucent, allowing the stone to sparkle faintly in\nthe fungal light as he studied TenSoon.\nI made my body opaque, TenSoon realized. Like that of a human, with tan skin to obscure the\nmuscles beneath. Why had that come so naturally to him? Once, he had cursed the years he spent\namong the humans, using their bones instead of a True Body. Perhaps he had fallen to that same old\ndefault because his captors hadn't given him a True Body. Human bones. An insult, of sorts.\nTenSoon stood. \"What?\" he asked at the look in VarSell's eyes."

An insult, of sorts.\nTenSoon stood. \"What?\" he asked at the look in VarSell's eyes.\n\"I just picked a random set of bones from the storeroom,\" VarSell said. \"It's ironic that I would give\nyou a set of bones that you'd originally contributed.\"\nTenSoon frowned. What?\nAnd then he made the connection. The body that TenSoon had created around the bones must look\nconvincing—as if it were the original one that these bones had belonged to. VarSell assumed that\nTenSoon had been able to create such a realistic approximation because he'd originally digested the\nhuman's corpse, and therefore knew how to create the right body around the bones.\nTenSoon smiled. \"I've never worn these bones before.\"\nVarSell eyed him. He was of the Fifth Generation—two centuries younger than TenSoon. Indeed,\neven among those of the Third Generation, few kandra had as much experience with the outside world as\nTenSoon.\n\"I see,\" VarSell finally said.\nTenSoon turned, looking over the small chamber. Three more Fifth Generationers stood near the\ndoor, watching him. Like VarSell, few of them wore clothing—and those who did wore only\nopen-fronted robes. Kandra tended to wear little while in the Homeland, as that allowed them to better\ndisplay their True Bodies.\nTenSoon saw two sparkling rods of metal embedded in the clear muscles of each Fifth's\nshoulders—all three had the Blessing of Potency. The Second Generation was taking no risk of his\nescaping. It was, of course, another insult. TenSoon had come to his fate willingly.\n\"Well?\" TenSoon asked, turning back to VarSell. \"Are we to go?\"\nVarSell glanced at one of his companions. \"Forming the body was expected to take you longer.\"\nTenSoon snorted. \"The Second Generation is unpracticed. They assume that because it still takes them\nmany hours to create a body, the rest of us require the same amount of time.\"\n\"They are your elder generation,\" VarSell said. \"You should show them respect.\"\n\"The Second Generation has been sequestered in these caves for centuries,\" TenSoon said, \"sending\nthe rest of us to serve Contracts while they remain lazy. I passed them in skill long ago.\"\nVarSell hissed, and for a moment TenSoon thought the younger kandra might slap him. VarSell\nrestrained himself, barely—to TenSoon's amusement. After all, as a member of the Third Generation,\nTenSoon was senior to VarSell—much in the same way that the Seconds were supposedly senior to\nTenSoon.\nYet, the Thirds were a special case. They always had been. That's why the Seconds kept them out on\nContracts so much—it wouldn't do to have their immediate underlings around all the time, upsetting their\nperfect little kandra utopia.\n\"Let's go, then,\" VarSell finally decided, nodding for two of his guards to lead the way. The other one\njoined VarSell, walking behind TenSoon. Like VarSell, these three had True Bodies formed of stone.\nThose were popular among the Fifth Generation, who had time to commission—and use—lavish True\nBodies. They were the favored pups of the Seconds, and tended to spend more time than most in the\nHomeland."

They were the favored pups of the Seconds, and tended to spend more time than most in the\nHomeland.\nThey had given TenSoon no clothing. So, as they walked, he dissolved his genitals, and re-formed a\nsmooth crotch, as was common among the kandra. He tried to walk with pride and confidence, but he\nknew this body wouldn't look very intimidating. It was emaciated—he'd lost much mass during his\nimprisonment and more to the acid, and he hadn't been able to form very large muscles.\nThe smooth, rock tunnel had probably once been a natural formation, but over the centuries, the\nyounger generations had been used during their infancy to smooth out the stone with their digestive juices.\nTenSoon didn't see many other kandra. VarSell kept to back corridors, obviously not wanting to make\ntoo much of a show.\nI've been away so long, TenSoon thought. The Eleventh Generation must have been chosen by\nnow. I still don't know most of the Eighth, let alone the Ninth or Tenth.\nHe was beginning to suspect that there wouldn't be a Twelfth Generation. Even if there were, things\ncould not continue as they had. The Father was dead. What, then, of the First Contract? His people had\nspent ten centuries enslaved to humankind, serving the Contracts in an effort to keep themselves safe.\nMost of the kandra hated men for their situation. Up until recently, TenSoon had been one of those.\nIt's ironic, TenSoon thought. But, even when we wear True Bodies, we wear them in the form of\nhumans. Two arms, two legs, even faces formed after the fashion of mankind.\nSometimes he wondered if the unbirthed—the creatures that the humans called mistwraiths—were\nmore honest than their brothers the kandra. The mistwraiths would form a body however they wished,\nconnecting bones in odd arrangements, making almost artistic designs from both human and animal\nbones. The kandra, though—they created bodies that looked human. Even while they cursed humankind\nfor keeping them enslaved.\nSuch a strange people they were. But they were his. Even if he had betrayed them.\nAnd now I have to convince the First Generation that I was right in that betrayal. Not for me.\nFor them. For all of us.\nThey passed through corridors and chambers, eventually arriving at sections of the Homeland that\nwere more familiar to TenSoon. He soon realized that their destination must be the Trustwarren. He\nwould argue his defense in his people's most sacred place. He should have guessed.\nA year of torturous imprisonment had earned him a trial before the First Generation. He'd had a year\nto think about what to say. And if he failed, he'd have an eternity to think about what he'd done wrong.\nIt is too easy for people to characterize Ruin as simply a force of destruction. Think rather of Ruin\nas intelligent decay. Not simply chaos, but a force that sought in a rational—and dangerous—way\nto break everything down to its most basic forms.\nRuin could plan and carefully plot, knowing if he built one thing up, he could use it to knock\ndown two others. The nature of the world is that when we create something, we often destroy\nsomething else in the process.\n8"

The nature of the world is that when we create something, we often destroy\nsomething else in the process.\n8\nON THE FIRST DAY OUT OF VETITAN, Vin and Elend murdered a hundred of the villagers. Or,\nat least, that was how Vin felt.\nShe sat on a rotting stump at the center of camp, watching the sun approach the distant horizon,\nknowing what was about to happen. Ash fell silently around her. And the mists appeared.\nOnce—not so long ago—the mists had come only at night. During the year following the Lord Ruler's\ndeath, however, that had changed. As if a thousand years of being confined to the darkness had made\nthe mists restless.\nAnd so, they had begun to come during the day. Sometimes, they came in great rolling waves,\nappearing out of nowhere, disappearing as quickly. Most commonly, however, they just appeared in the\nair like a thousand phantoms, twisting and growing together. Tendrils of mist that sprouted, vine-like\ntentacles creeping across the sky. Each day, they retreated a little bit later in the day, and each day they\nappeared a little earlier in the evening. Soon—perhaps before the year ended—they would smother the\nland permanently. And this presented a problem, for ever since that night when Vin had taken the power\nof the Well of Ascension, the mists killed.\nElend had had trouble believing Sazed's stories two years before, when the Terrisman had come to\nLuthadel with horrific reports of terrified villagers and mists that killed. Vin too had assumed that Sazed\nwas mistaken. A part of her wished she could continue in that delusion as she watched the waiting\ntownspeople, huddled together on the broad open plain, surrounded by soldiers and koloss.\nThe deaths began as soon as the mists appeared. Though the mists left most of the people alone, they\nchose some at random, causing them to begin shaking. These fell to the ground, having a seizure, while\ntheir friends and family watched in shock and horror.\nHorror was still Vin's reaction. That, and frustration. Kelsier had promised her that the mists were an\nally—that they would protect her and give her power. She'd believed that to be true until the mists started\nto feel alien to her, hiding shadowed ghosts and murderous intent.\n\"I hate you,\" she whispered as the mists continued their grisly work. It was like watching a beloved old\nrelative pick strangers out of a crowd and, one at a time, slit their throats. And there was nothing at all\nshe could do. Elend's scholars had tried everything—hoods to keep the mists from being breathed in,\nwaiting to go outside until the mists had already established themselves, rushing people inside the moment\nthey started shaking. Animals were immune for some reason, but every human was potentially\nsusceptible. If one went outside in the mists, one risked death, and nothing could prevent it.\nIt was over soon. The mists gave the fits to fewer than one in six, and only a small fraction of those\ndied. Plus, one only needed to risk these new mists once—one gamble, and then you were immune.\nMost who fell sick would recover. That was no comfort to the families of those who died."

That was no comfort to the families of those who died.\nShe sat on her stump, staring out into the mists, which were still lit by the setting sun. Ironically, it was\nmore difficult for her to see than it would have been if it were dark. She couldn't burn much tin, lest the\nsunlight blind her—but without it, she couldn't pierce the mists.\nThe result was a scene that reminded her why she had once feared the mists. Her visibility reduced to\nbarely ten feet, she could see little more than shadows. Amorphous figures ran this way and that, calling\nout. Silhouettes knelt or stood terrified. Sound was a traitorous thing, echoing against unseen objects,\ncries coming from phantom sources.\nVin sat among them, ash raining around her like burnt tears, and bowed her head.\n\"Lord Fatren!\" Elend's voice called, causing Vin to look up. Once, his voice hadn't carried nearly as\nmuch authority. That seemed like so long ago. He appeared from the mists, dressed in his second white\nuniform—the one that was still clean—his face hardened against the mortalities. She could feel his\nAllomantic touch on those around him as he approached—his Soothing would make the people's pain\nless acute, but he didn't Push as hard as he could have. She knew from talking to him that he didn't feel it\nwas right to remove all of a person's grief at the death of one they loved.\n\"My lord!\" she heard Fatren say, and saw him approaching. \"This is a disaster!\"\n\"It looks far worse than it is, Lord Fatren,\" Elend said. \"As I explained, most of those who have fallen\nwill recover.\"\nFatren stopped beside Vin's stump. Then, he turned and stared into the mists, listening to the weeping\nand the pain of his people. \"I can't believe we did this. I can't . . . I can't believe you talked me into\nmaking them stand in the mists.\"\n\"Your people needed to be inoculated, Fatren,\" Elend said.\nIt was true. They didn't have tents for all of the townsfolk, and that left only two options. Leave them\nbehind in their dying village, or force them north—make them go out in the mists, and see who died. It\nwas terrible, and it was brutal, but it would have happened eventually. Still, even though she knew the\nlogic of what they had done, Vin felt terrible for being part of it.\n\"What kind of monsters are we?\" Fatren asked in a hushed tone.\n\"The kind we have to be,\" Elend said. \"Go make a count. Find out how many are dead. Calm the\nliving and promise them that no further harm will come from the mists.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Fatren said, moving away.\nVin watched him go. \"We murdered them, Elend,\" she whispered. \"We told them it would be all right.\nWe forced them to leave their village and come out here, to die.\"\n\"It will be all right,\" Elend said, laying a hand on her shoulder. \"Better than a slow death in that village.\"\n\"We could have given them a choice.\""

Within a few months, their city will be covered in mists\npermanently. They would have had to stay inside their homes and starve, or go out into the mists. Better\nthat we take them to the Central Dominance, where there is still enough mistless daylight to grow crops.\"\n\"The truth doesn't make it any easier.\"\nElend stood in the mists, ash falling around him. \"No,\" he said. \"It doesn't. I'll go gather the koloss so\nthey can bury the dead.\"\n\"And the wounded?\" Those the mists attacked, but didn't kill, would be sick and cramped for several\ndays, perhaps longer. If the usual percentages held, then nearly a thousand of the villagers would fall into\nthat category.\n\"When we leave tomorrow, we'll have the koloss carry them. If we can get to the canal, then we can\nprobably fit most of them on the barges.\"\nVin didn't like feeling exposed. She'd spent her childhood hiding in corners, her adolescence playing the\nsilent nighttime assassin. So it was incredibly difficult not to feel exposed while traveling with five\nthousand tired villagers along one of the Southern Dominance's most obvious routes.\nShe walked a short distance away from the townspeople—she never rode—and tried to find\nsomething to distract herself from thinking about the deaths the evening before. Unfortunately, Elend was\nriding with Fatren and the other town leaders, busy trying to smooth relations. That left her alone.\nExcept for her single koloss.\nThe massive beast lumbered beside her. She kept it close partially out of convenience; she knew it\nwould make the villagers keep their distance from her. As willing as she was to be distracted, she didn't\nwant to deal with those betrayed, frightened eyes. Not right now.\nNobody understood the koloss, least of all Vin. She'd discovered how to control them, using the\nhidden Allomantic trigger. Yet, during the thousand years of the Lord Ruler's reign, he had kept the\nkoloss separated from mankind, letting very little be known about them beyond their brutal prowess in\nbattle and their simple bestial nature.\nEven now, Vin could feel her koloss tugging at her, trying to break free. It didn't like being\ncontrolled—it wanted to attack her. It could not, fortunately; she controlled it, and would continue to do\nso whether awake or asleep, burning metals or not, unless someone stole the beast from her.\nEven linked as they were, there was so much Vin didn't understand about the creatures. She looked\nup, and found the koloss staring at her with its bloodred eyes. Its skin was stretched tight across its face,\nthe nose pulled completely flat. The skin was torn near the right eye, and a jagged rip ran down to the\ncorner of its mouth, letting a flap of blue skin hang free, exposing the red muscles and bloodied teeth\nbelow.\n\"Don't look at me,\" the creature said, speaking in a sluggish voice. Its words were slurred, partially\nfrom the way its lips were pulled.\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\n\"You don't think I'm human,\" the koloss said, speaking slowly, deliberately—like the others she had"

It was like they had to think hard between each word.\n\"You aren't human,\" Vin said. \"You're something else.\"\n\"I will be human,\" the koloss said. \"We will kill you. Take your cities. Then we will be human.\"\nVin shivered. It was a common theme among koloss. She'd heard others make similar remarks. There\nwas something very chilling about the flat, emotionless way the koloss spoke of slaughtering people.\nThey were created by the Lord Ruler, she thought. Of course they're twisted. As twisted as he\nwas.\n\"What is your name?\" she asked the koloss.\nIt continued to lumber beside her. Finally, it looked at her. \"Human.\"\n\"I know you want to be human,\" Vin said. \"What is your name?\"\n\"That is my name. Human. You call me Human.\"\nVin frowned as they walked. That almost seemed . . . clever. She'd never taken the opportunity to\ntalk to koloss before. She'd always assumed that they were of a homogeneous mentality—just the same\nstupid beast repeated over and over.\n\"All right, Human,\" she said, curious. \"How long have you been alive?\"\nHe walked for a moment, so long that Vin thought he had forgotten the question. Finally, however, he\nspoke. \"Don't you see my bigness?\"\n\"Your bigness? Your size?\"\nHuman just kept walking.\n\"So you all grow at the same rate?\"\nHe didn't answer. Vin shook her head, suspecting that the question was too abstract for the beast.\n\"I'm bigger than some,\" Human said. \"Smaller than some—but not very many. That means I'm old.\"\nAnother sign of intelligence, she thought, raising an eyebrow. From what Vin had seen of other\nkoloss, Human's logic was impressive.\n\"I hate you,\" Human said after a short time spent walking. \"I want to kill you. But I can't kill you.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"I won't let you.\"\n\"You're big inside. Very big.\"\n\"Yes,\" Vin said. \"Human, where are the girl koloss?\"\nThe creature walked several moments. \"Girl?\"\n\"Like me,\" Vin said.\n\"We're not like you,\" he said. \"We're big on the outside only.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"Not my size. My . . .\" How did one describe gender? Short of stripping, she couldn't\nthink of any methods. So, she decided to try a different tactic. \"Are there baby koloss?\"\n\"Baby?\"\n\"Small ones,\" Vin said.\nThe koloss pointed toward the marching koloss army. \"Small ones,\" he said, referring to some of the\nfive-foot-tall koloss.\n\"Smaller,\" Vin said.\n\"None smaller.\"\nKoloss reproduction was a mystery that, to her knowledge, nobody had ever cracked. Even after a\nyear spent fighting with the beasts, she'd never found out where new ones came from. Whenever Elend's\nkoloss armies grew too small, she and he stole new ones from the Inquisitors.\nYet, it was ridiculous to assume that the koloss didn't reproduce. She'd seen koloss camps that"

She'd seen koloss camps that\nweren't controlled by an Allomancer, and the creatures killed each other with fearful regularity. At that\nrate, they would have killed themselves off after a few years. Yet, they had lasted for ten centuries.\nThat implied a very quick rise from child to adult, or so Sazed and Elend seemed to think. They hadn't\nbeen able to confirm their theories, and she knew their ignorance frustrated Elend greatly—especially\nsince his duties as emperor left him little time for the studies he'd once enjoyed so much.\n\"If there are none smaller,\" Vin asked, \"then where do new koloss come from?\"\n\"New koloss come from us,\" Human finally said.\n\"From you?\" Vin asked, frowning as she walked. \"That doesn't tell me much.\"\nHuman didn't say anything further. His talkative mood had apparently passed.\nFrom us, Vin thought. They bud off of each other, perhaps? She'd heard of some creatures that, if\nyou cut them the right way, each half would grow into a new animal. But, that couldn't be the case with\nkoloss—she'd seen battlefields filled with their dead, and no pieces rose to form new koloss. But she'd\nalso never seen a female koloss. Though most of the beasts wore crude loincloths, they were—as far as\nshe knew—all male.\nFurther speculation was cut off as she noticed the line ahead bunching up; the crowd was slowing.\nCurious, she dropped a coin and left Human behind, shooting herself over the people. The mists had\nretreated hours ago, and though night was again approaching, for the moment it was both light and\nmistless.\nTherefore, as she shot through the falling ash, she easily picked out the canal up ahead. It cut\nunnaturally through the ground, far straighter than any river. Elend speculated that the constant ashfall\nwould soon put an end to most of the canal systems. Without skaa laborers to dredge them on a regular\nbasis, they would fill up with ashen sediment, eventually clogging to uselessness.\nVin soared through the air, completing her arc, heading toward a large mass of tents stationed beside\nthe canal. Thousands of fires spit smoke into the afternoon air, and men milled about, training, working,\nor preparing. Nearly fifty thousand soldiers bivouacked here, using the canal route as a supply line back\nto Luthadel.\nVin dropped another coin, bounding through the air again. She quickly caught up to the small group of\nhorses that had broken off from Elend's line of tired, marching skaa. She landed—dropping a coin and\nPushing against it slightly to slow her descent, throwing up a spray of ash as she hit.\nElend reined in his horse, smiling as he surveyed the camp. The expression was rare enough on his lips\nthese days that Vin found herself smiling as well. Ahead, a group of men waited for them—their scouts\nwould have long since noticed the townspeople's approach.\n\"Lord Elend!\" said a man sitting at the head of the army contingent. \"You're ahead of schedule!\"\n\"I assume you're ready anyway, General,\" Elend said, dismounting."

The general wore well-used armor of\nleather and steel, his face bearing a scar on one cheek, the left side of his scalp missing a large patch of\nhair where a koloss blade had nearly taken his head. Ever formal, the grizzled man bowed to Elend, who\njust slapped him on the shoulder affectionately.\nVin's smile lingered. I remember when that man was little more than a fresh recruit standing\nfrightened in a tunnel. Demoux wasn't actually that much older than she was, even though his tanned\nface and callused hands gave that impression.\n\"We've held position, my lord,\" Demoux said as Fatren and his brother dismounted and joined the\ngroup. \"Not that there was much to hold it against. Still, it was good for my men to practice fortifying a\ncamp.\"\nIndeed, the army's camp beside the canal was surrounded by heaped earth and spikes—a\nconsiderable feat, considering the army's size.\n\"You did well, Demoux,\" Elend said, turning back to look over the townspeople. \"Our mission was a\nsuccess.\"\n\"I can see that, my lord,\" Demoux said, smiling. \"That's a fair pack of koloss you picked up. I hope the\nInquisitor leading them wasn't too sad to see them go.\"\n\"Couldn't have bothered him too much,\" Elend said. \"Since he was dead at the time. We found the\nstorage cavern as well.\"\n\"Praise the Survivor!\" Demoux said.\nVin frowned. At his neck, hanging outside his clothing, Demoux wore a necklace that bore a small\nsilver spear: the increasingly popular symbol of the Church of the Survivor. It seemed odd to her that the\nweapon that had killed Kelsier would become the symbol of his followers.\nOf course, she didn't like to think about the other possibility—that the spear might not represent the\none that had killed Kelsier. It might very well represent the one that she herself had used to kill the Lord\nRuler. She'd never asked Demoux which it was. Despite three years of growing Church power, Vin had\nnever become comfortable with her own part in its doctrine.\n\"Praise the Survivor indeed,\" Elend said, looking over the army's supply barges. \"How did your\nproject go?\"\n\"Dredging the southern bend?\" Demoux asked. \"It went well—there was blessed little else to do while\nwe waited. You should be able to get barges through there now.\"\n\"Good,\" Elend said. \"Form two task forces of five hundred men. Send one with barges back to\nVetitan for the supplies we had to leave down in that cavern. They will transfer the supplies to the barges\nand send them up to Luthadel.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Demoux said.\n\"Send the second group of soldiers north to Luthadel with these refugees,\" Elend said, nodding to\nFatren. \"This is Lord Fatren. He's in command of the townspeople. Have your men respect his wishes, as\nlong as they are reasonable, and introduce him to Lord Penrod.\""

However, his\ntime with Elend had transformed him surprisingly quickly. The dirty leader nodded gratefully at the escort.\n\"You . . . aren't coming with us then, my lord?\"\nElend shook his head. \"I have other work to do, and your people need to get to Luthadel, where they\ncan begin farming. Though, if any of your men wish to join my army, they are welcome. I'm always in\nneed of good troops, and against the odds, you succeeded in training a useful force.\"\n\"My lord . . . why not just compel them? Pardon me, but that's what you've done so far.\"\n\"I compelled your people to safety, Fatren,\" Elend said. \"Sometimes even a drowning man will fight the\none who tries to save him and must be compelled. My army is a different matter. Men who don't want to\nfight are men you can't depend on in battle, and I won't have any of those in my army.

The location of the final cache?\"\nElend nodded. \"It's in Fadrex.\"\n\"Cett's city?\" Demoux asked, laughing. \"Well, he'll be happy to hear that. He's been complaining for\nover a year that we haven't ever gotten around to conquering it back for him.\"\nElend smiled wanly. \"I've been half convinced that if we did, Cett would decide that he—and his\nsoldiers—didn't need us anymore.\"\n\"He'll stay, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"After the scare Lady Vin gave him last year . . .\"\nDemoux glanced at Vin, trying to smile, but she saw it in his eyes. Respect, far too much of it. He\ndidn't joke with her the way he did with Elend. She still couldn't believe that Elend had joined that silly\nreligion of theirs. Elend's intentions had been political—by joining the skaa faith, Elend had forged a link\nbetween himself and the common people. Even so, the move made her uncomfortable.\nA year of marriage had taught her, however, that there were some things one just had to ignore. She\ncould love Elend for his desire to do the right thing, even when she thought he'd done the opposite.\n\"Call a meeting this evening, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"We have much to discuss—and let me know when\nSazed arrives.\""

Or, at least, Allomancy began at the same time as the\nmists' first appearances. When Rashek took the power at the Well of Ascension, he became aware\nof certain things. Some were whispered to him by Ruin; others were granted to him as an\ninstinctive part of the power.\nOne of these was an understanding of the Three Metallic Arts. He knew, for instance, that the\nnuggets of metal in the Chamber of Ascension would make those who ingested them into\nMistborn. These were, after all, fractions of the very power in the Well itself.\n9\nTENSOON HAD VISITED the Trustwarren before; he was of the Third Generation. He had been\nborn seven centuries ago, when the kandra were still new—though by that time, the First Generation had\nalready given over the raising of new kandra to the Second Generation.\nThe Seconds hadn't done very well with TenSoon's generation—or, at least, that was how the\nSeconds felt. They'd wanted to form a society of individuals who followed strict rules of respect and\nseniority. A \"perfect\" people who lived to serve their Contracts—and, of course, the members of the\nSecond Generation.\nUp until his return, TenSoon had generally been considered one of the least troublesome of the Thirds.\nHe'd been known as a kandra who cared little for Homeland politics; one who served out his Contracts,\ncontent to keep himself as far away from the Seconds and their machinations as possible. It was ironic\nindeed that TenSoon would end up on trial for the most heinous of kandra crimes.\nHis guards marched him right into the center of the Trustwarren—onto the platform itself. TenSoon\nwasn't certain whether to be honored or ashamed. Even as a member of the Third Generation, he hadn't\noften been allowed so near the Trust.\nThe room was large and circular, with metal walls. The platform was a massive steel disk set into the\nrock floor. It wasn't very high—perhaps a foot tall—but it was ten feet in diameter. TenSoon's feet felt\ncold hitting its slick surface, and he was reminded again of his nudity. They didn't bind his hands; that\nwould have been too much of an insult even for him. Kandra obeyed the Contract, even those of the\nThird Generation. He would not run, and he would not strike down one of his own. He was better than\nthat.\nThe room was lit by lamps, rather than glowstone, though each lamp was enclosed in blue glass. Oil\nwas difficult to get—the Second Generation, for good reason, didn't want to rely on supplies from the\nworld of men. The people above, even most of the Father's servants, didn't know there was a centralized\nkandra government.

They were close enough\nto see, study, and speak to—yet far enough away that TenSoon felt isolated, standing alone in the center\nof the platform. His feet were cold. He looked down, and noticed the small hole in the floor near his toes.\nIt was cut into the steel disk of the platform.\nThe Trust, he thought. It was directly underneath him.\n\"TenSoon of the Third Generation,\" a voice said.\nTenSoon looked up. It was KanPaar, of course. He was a tall kandra—or, rather, he preferred to use\na tall True Body. Like all of the Seconds, his bones were constructed of the purest crystal—his with a\ndeep red tint. It was an impractical body in many ways. Those bones wouldn't stand up to much\npunishment. Yet, for the life of an administrator in the Homeland, the weakness of the bones was\napparently an acceptable trade-off for their sparkling beauty.\n\"I am here,\" TenSoon said.\n\"You insist on forcing this trial?\" KanPaar said, keeping his voice lofty, reinforcing his thick accent. By\nstaying away from humans for so long, his language hadn't been corrupted by their dialects. The Seconds'\naccents were similar to that of the Father, supposedly.\n\"Yes,\" TenSoon said.\nKanPaar sighed audibly, standing behind his fine stone lectern. Finally, he bowed his head toward the\nupper reaches of the room. The First Generation watched from above. They sat in their individual alcoves\nrunning around the perimeter of the upper room, shadowed to the point where they were little more than\nhumanoid lumps. They did not speak. That was for the Seconds.\nThe doors behind TenSoon opened, and hushed voices sounded, feet rustling. He turned, smiling to\nhimself as he watched them enter. Kandra of various sizes and ages. The very youngest ones wouldn't be\nallowed to attend an event this important, but those of the adult generations—everyone up through the\nNinth Generation—could not be denied. This was his victory, perhaps the only one he would have in the\nentire trial.\nIf he was to be condemned to endless imprisonment, then he wanted his people to know the truth.\nMore important, he wanted them to hear this trial, to hear what he had to say. He would not convince the\nSecond Generation, and who knew what the Firsts would silently think, sitting in their shadowed alcoves?\nThe younger kandra, however . . . perhaps they would listen. Perhaps they would do something, once\nTenSoon was gone. He watched them file in, filling the stone benches. There were hundreds of kandra\nnow. The elder generations—Firsts, Seconds, Thirds—were small in number, since many had been killed\nin the early days, when the humans had feared them. However, later generations were well\npopulated—the Tenth Generation had over a hundred individuals in it. The Trustwarren's benches had\nbeen constructed to hold the entire kandra population, but they were now filled just by those who\nhappened to be free from both duty and Contract."

Instead, she froze just inside the doorway, forcing others to push\naround her in annoyance as they found seats.\nHe shouldn't have recognized her. She had a new True Body—an eccentric one, with bones made of\nwood. They were thin and willowy in an exaggerated, unnatural way: her wooden skull long with a\npointed triangular chin, her eyes too large, twisted bits of cloth sticking from her head like hair. The\nyounger generations were pushing the boundaries of propriety, annoying the Seconds. Once, TenSoon\nwould probably have agreed with them—even now, he was something of a traditionalist.

He actually sounds like he's going to enjoy this.\nAnd why not? After centuries of preaching that the Third Generation is filled with miscreants?\nThey've tried all this time to overcome their mistakes with us—mistakes like giving us too much\nfreedom, letting us think that we were as good as they were. By proving that I—the most\n\"temperate\" of the Thirds—am a danger, KanPaar will win a struggle he's been fighting for most\nof his life.\nTenSoon had always found it strange how threatened the Seconds felt by the Thirds.

Either way, I bless Rashek for his oversight, for without that nugget, Elend\nwould have died that day at the Well.\n10\nLARSTAISM WAS A DIFFICULT one for Sazed to measure. The religion seemed innocent enough.\nThey knew much about it; a Keeper during the fourth century had managed to uncover an entire trove of\nprayer materials, scriptures, notes, and writings which had once belonged to a high-ranking member of\nthe religion.\nAnd yet, the religion itself didn't seem very . . . well, religious. It had focused on art, not the sacred in\nthe usual sense, and had centered around donating money to support monks so that they could compose\npoetry and paint and sculpt works of art. That, actually, blocked Sazed's attempts to dismiss it, as he\ncouldn't find any contradictions in its doctrines. It just didn't have enough of those for them to conflict\nwith one another.\nHe held the paper in front of him, shaking his head, reading over the sheet again. It was strapped to\nthe front of the portfolio to keep it from being caught in the wind, and a parasol strapped to his saddle\nkept most of the ash from smearing the page. He had heard Vin complain that she didn't know how\npeople could possibly read while riding a horse, but this method made it rather easy.\nHe didn't have to turn pages. He simply read the same words over and over, turning them in his mind,\nplaying with them. Trying to decide. Did this one have the truth? It was the one that Mare, Kelsier's wife,\nhad believed. She'd been one of the few people Sazed had ever met who had chosen to believe in one of\nthe old religions he had preached.\nThe Larsta believed that life was about seeking the divine, he read. They taught that art draws\nus closer to understanding divinity. Since not all men can spend their time in art, it is to the\nbenefit of society as a whole to support a group of dedicated artists to create great works, which\nthen elevate those who experience them.\nThat was all well and good, in Sazed's estimation, but what about questions of life and death? What\nabout the spirit? What was the divine, and how could such terrible things happen to the world if divinity\ndid exist?\n\"You know,\" Breeze said from the saddle of his horse, \"there's something amazing about all of this.\"\nThe comment broke Sazed's concentration. He sighed, looking up from his research. The horse\ncontinued to clop along beneath him. \"Amazing about what, Lord Breeze?\"\n\"The ash,\" Breeze said. \"I mean, look at it. Covering everything, making the land look so black. It's\nsimply astounding how dreary the landscape has become. Back in the Lord Ruler's reign, everything was\nbrown, and most plants grown outdoors looked as if they were on the very edge of sickly death. I\nthought that was depressing. But ash falling every day, burying the entire land . . .\" The Soother shook\nhis head, smiling. \"I wouldn't have thought it possible for things to actually be worse without the Lord"

But ash falling every day, burying the entire land . . .\" The Soother shook\nhis head, smiling. \"I wouldn't have thought it possible for things to actually be worse without the Lord\nRuler. But, well, we've certainly made a mess! Destroying the world. That's no mean feat, if you think\nabout it. I wonder if we should be impressed with ourselves.\"\nSazed frowned. Occasional flakes drifted from the sky, the upper atmosphere darkened by its usual\ndark haze. The ashfall was light, if persistent, falling steadily for nearly two months now. Their horses\nmoved through a good half-foot of the stuff as they moved southward, accompanied by a hundred of\nElend's soldiers. How long would it be before the ash grew so deep that travel was impossible? It\nalready drifted several feet high in some places.\nEverything was black—the hills, the road, the entire countryside. Trees drooped with the weight of ash\non their leaves and branches. Most of the ground foliage was likely dead—bringing even two horses with\nthem on the trip to Lekal City had been difficult, for there was nothing for them to graze on. The soldiers\nhad been forced to carry feed.\n\"I do have to say, however,\" Breeze continued, chatting along in his normal way, protected from the\nash by a parasol attached to the back of his saddle, \"the ash is a tad unimaginative.\"\n\"Unimaginative?\"\n\"Why, yes,\" Breeze said. \"While I do happen to like black as a color for suits, I otherwise find it a\nsomewhat uninspired hue.\"\n\"What else would the ash be?\"\nBreeze shrugged. \"Well, Vin says that there's something behind all this, right? Some evil force of doom\nor whatever? Well, if I were said force of doom, then I certainly wouldn't have used my powers to turn\nthe land black. It just lacks flair. Red. Now, that would be an interesting color. Think of the\npossibilities—if the ash were red, the rivers would run like blood. Black is so monotonous that you can\nforget about it, but red—you'd always be thinking, 'Why, look at that. That hill is red. That evil force of\ndoom trying to destroy me certainly has style.' \"\n\"I'm not convinced there is any 'evil force of doom,' Breeze,\" Sazed said.\n\"Oh?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"The ashmounts have always spewed out ash. Is it really that much of a stretch\nto assume that they have become more active than before? Perhaps this is all the result of natural\nprocesses.\"\n\"And the mists?\"\n\"Weather patterns change, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps it was simply too warm during the day\nfor them to come out before. Now that the ashmounts are emitting more ash, it would make sense that\nthe days are growing colder, and so the mists stay longer.\"\n\"Oh? And if that were the case, my dear man, then why haven't the mists stayed out during the day in\nthe winters? It was colder then than the summer, but the mists always left when day arrived.\"\nSazed grew silent. Breeze made a good point. Yet, as Sazed checked each new religion off of his list,\nhe wondered more and more if they were simply creating an enemy in this \"force\" Vin had felt. He didn't"

He didn't believe for a moment that she would have fabricated her stories. Yet, if there\nwere no truth in the religions, was it too much of a stretch to infer that the world was simply ending\nbecause it was time?\n\"Green,\" Breeze finally said.\nSazed turned.\n\"Now, that would be a color with style,\" Breeze said. \"Different. You can't see green and forget about\nit—not like you can black or brown. Wasn't Kelsier always talking about plants being green, once?\nBefore the Ascension of the Lord Ruler, before the first time the Deepness came upon the land?\"\n\"That's what the histories claim.\"\nBreeze nodded thoughtfully. \"Style indeed,\" he said. \"It would be pretty, I think.\"\n\"Oh?\" Sazed asked, genuinely surprised. \"Most people with whom I have spoken seem to find the\nconcept of green plants rather odd.\"\n\"I thought that once, but now, after seeing black all day, every day . . . Well, I think a little variety\nwould be nice. Fields of green . . . little specks of color . . . what did Kelsier call those?\"\n\"Flowers,\" Sazed said. The Larsta had written poems about them.\n\"Yes,\" Breeze said. \"It will be nice when those return.\"\n\"Return?\"\nBreeze shrugged. \"Well, the Church of the Survivor teaches that Vin will someday cleanse the sky of\nash and the air of mists. I figure while she's at it, she might as well bring back the plants and the flowers.\nSeems like a suitably feminine thing to do, for some reason.\"\nSazed sighed, shaking his head. \"Lord Breeze,\" he said, \"I realize that you are simply trying to\nencourage me. However, I have serious trouble believing that you accept the teachings of the Church of\nthe Survivor.\"\nBreeze hesitated. Then, he smiled. \"So I overdid it a bit, did I?\"\n\"A tad.\"\n\"It's difficult to tell with you, my dear man. You're so aware of my touch on your emotions that I can't\nuse much Allomancy, and you've been so . . . well, different lately.\" Breeze's voice grew wistful. \"Still, it\nwould be nice to see those green plants our Kelsier always spoke of. After six months of ash . . . well, it\nmakes a man at least want to believe. Perhaps that's enough for an old hypocrite like me.\"\nThe sense of despair inside Sazed wanted to snap that simply believing wasn't enough. Wishing and\nbelieving hadn't gotten him anywhere. It wouldn't change the fact that the plants were dying and the world\nwas ending.\nIt wasn't worth fighting, because nothing meant anything.\nSazed forced himself to stop that line of thought, but it was difficult. He worried, sometimes, about his\nmelancholy. Unfortunately, much of the time, he had trouble summoning even the effort to care about his\nown pessimistic bent.\nThe Larsta, he told himself.

The Larsta focused so much on beauty and art as being\n\"divine.\" Well, if divinity was in any way related to art, then a god couldn't in any way be involved in\nwhat was happening to the world. The ash, the dismal, depressing landscape . . . it was more than just\n\"unimaginative,\" as Breeze had put it. It was completely insipid. Dull. Monotonous.\nReligion not true, Sazed wrote at the bottom of the paper. Teachings are directly contradicted by\nobserved events.\nHe undid the straps on his portfolio and slipped the sheet in, one step closer to having gone through all\nof them. Sazed could see Breeze watching out of the corner of his eye; the Soother loved secrets. Sazed\ndoubted the man would be all that impressed if he discovered what the work was really about. Either\nway, Sazed just wished that Breeze would leave him alone when it came to these studies.\nI shouldn't be curt with him, though, Sazed thought. He knew the Soother was, in his own way, just\ntrying to help. Breeze had changed since they'd first met. Early on—despite glimmers of\ncompassion—Breeze really had been the selfish, callous manipulator that he now only pretended to be.\nSazed suspected that Breeze had joined Kelsier's team not out of a desire to help the skaa, but because\nof the challenge the scheme had presented, not to mention the rich reward Kelsier had promised.\nThat reward—the Lord Ruler's atium cache—had proven to be a myth. Breeze had found other\nrewards instead.\nUp ahead, Sazed noticed someone moving through the ash. The figure wore black, but against the field\nof ash, it was easy to pick out even a hint of flesh tone. It appeared to be one of their scouts. Captain\nGoradel called the line to a halt, then sent a man forward to meet the scout. Sazed and Breeze waited\npatiently.\n\"Scout report, Lord Ambassador,\" Captain Goradel said, walking up to Sazed's horse a short time\nlater. \"The emperor's army is just a few hills away—less than an hour.\"\n\"Good,\" Sazed said, relishing the thought of seeing something other than the dreary hills of black.\n\"They've apparently seen us, Lord Ambassador,\" Goradel said. \"Riders are approaching. In fact, they\nare—\"\n\"Here,\" Sazed said, nodding into the near distance, where he saw a rider crest the hill. This one was\nvery easy to pick out against the black. Not only was it moving very quickly—actually galloping its poor\nhorse along the road—but it was also pink.\n\"Oh, dear,\" Breeze said with a sigh.\nThe bobbing figure resolved into a young woman with golden hair, wearing a bright pink dress—one\nthat made her look younger than her twenty-something years. Allrianne had a fondness for lace and frills,\nand she tended to wear colors that made her stand out. Sazed might have expected someone like her to\nbe a poor equestrian.

Allrianne, however, rode with easy mastery, something one would need in order to\nremain on the back of a galloping horse while wearing such a frivolous dress.\nThe young woman reared her horse up in front of Sazed's soldiers, spinning the animal in a flurry of\nruffled fabric and golden hair. About to dismount, she hesitated, eyeing the half-foot-deep layer of ash on\nthe ground.\n\"Allrianne?\" Breeze asked after a moment of silence.\n\"Hush,\" she said. \"I'm trying to decide if it's worth getting my dress dirty to scamper over and hug\nyou.\"\n\"We could wait until we get back to the camp . . .\"\n\"I couldn't embarrass you in front of your soldiers that way,\" she said.\n\"Technically, my dear,\" Breeze said, \"they're not my soldiers at all, but Sazed's.\"\nReminded of Sazed's presence, Allrianne looked up. She smiled prettily toward Sazed, then bent\nherself in a horseback version of a curtsy. \"Lord Ambassador,\" she said, and Sazed felt a sudden—and\nunnatural—fondness for the young lady. She was Rioting him. If there was anyone more brazen with their\nAllomantic powers than Breeze, it was Allrianne.\n\"Princess,\" Sazed said, nodding his head to her.\nFinally, Allrianne made her decision and slipped off the horse. She didn't quite \"scamper\"—instead,\nshe held up her dress in a rather unladylike fashion. It would have been immodest if she hadn't been\nwearing what appeared to be several layers of lace petticoats underneath.\nEventually, Captain Goradel came over and helped her up onto Breeze's horse so that she was sitting\nin the saddle in front of him. The two had never been officially married—partially, perhaps, because\nBreeze felt embarrassed to be in a relationship with a woman so much younger than himself. When\npressed on the issue, Breeze had explained that he didn't want to leave her as a widow when he\ndied—something he seemed to assume would happen immediately, though he was only in his mid-forties.\nWe'll all die soon, the way things are going, Sazed thought. Our ages do not matter.\nPerhaps that was part of why Breeze had finally accepted having a relationship with Allrianne. Either\nway, it was obvious from the way he looked at her—from the way he held her with a delicate, almost\nreverent touch—that he loved her very much.\nOur social structure is breaking down, Sazed thought as the column began to march again. Once,\nthe official stamp of a marriage would have been essential, especially in a relationship involving a\nyoung woman of her rank.\nAnd yet, who was there to be \"official\" for now? The obligators were all but extinct. Elend and Vin's\ngovernment was a thing of wartime necessity—a utilitarian, martially organized alliance of cities. And\nlooming over it all was the growing awareness that something was seriously wrong with the world.\nWhy bother to get married if you expected the world would end before the year was out?\nSazed shook his head.

This was a time when people needed structure—needed faith—to keep them\ngoing. He should have been the one to give it to them. The Church of the Survivor tried, but it was too\nnew, and its adherents were too inexperienced with religion. Already there were arguments about\ndoctrine and methodology, and each city of the New Empire was developing its own mutant variant of\nthe religion.\nIn the past, Sazed had taught religions without feeling a need to believe in each one. He'd accepted\neach as being special in its own way, and offered them up, as a waiter might serve an appetizer he himself\ndidn't feel like eating.\nDoing so now seemed hypocritical to Sazed. If this people needed faith, then he should not be the one\nto give it to them. He would not teach lies, not anymore.\nSazed splashed his face with the basin's cold water, enjoying the pleasurable shock. The water dribbled\ndown his cheeks and chin, carrying with it stains of ash. He dried his face with a clean towel, then took\nout his razor and mirror so that he could shave his head properly.\n\"Why do you keep doing that?\" asked an unexpected voice.\nSazed spun. His tent in the camp had been empty just moments before. Now, however, someone\nstood behind him. Sazed smiled. \"Lady Vin.\"\nShe folded her arms, raising an eyebrow. She had always moved stealthily, but she was getting so\ngood that it amazed even him. She'd barely rustled the tent flap with her entrance. She wore her standard\nshirt and trousers, after male fashion, though during the last two years she had grown her raven hair to a\nfeminine shoulder length. There had been a time when Vin had seemed to crouch wherever she went,\nalways trying to hide, rarely looking others in the eye. That had changed. She was still easy to miss, with\nher quiet ways, thin figure, and small stature. She now always looked people in the eye, however.\nAnd that made a big difference.\n\"General Demoux said that you were resting, Lady Vin,\" Sazed noted.\n\"Demoux knows better than to let me sleep through your arrival.\"\nSazed smiled to himself, then gestured toward a chair so that she could sit.\n\"You can keep shaving,\" she said. \"It's all right.\"\n\"Please,\" he said, gesturing again.\nVin sighed, taking the seat. \"You never answered my question, Saze,\" she said. \"Why do you keep\nwearing those steward's robes? Why do you keep your head shaved, after the fashion of a Terris\nservant? Why worry about showing disrespect by shaving while I'm here? You're not a servant\nanymore.\"\nHe sighed, carefully seating himself in the chair across from Vin. \"I'm not exactly sure what I am\nanymore, Lady Vin.\"\nThe tent walls flapped in a gentle breeze, a bit of ash blowing in through the door, which Vin hadn't\ntied closed behind herself. She frowned at his comment. \"You're Sazed.\"\n\"Emperor Venture's chief ambassador.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"That might be what you do, but that's not what you are.\"\n\"And what am I, then?\"\n\"Sazed,\" she repeated. \"Keeper of Terris.\""

His copperminds, the\nFeruchemical storages that contained the religions, histories, stories, and legends of peoples long dead. It\nall sat waiting to be taught, waiting to be added to. \"I fear that I have become a very selfish man, Lady\nVin,\" Sazed said quietly.\n\"That's silly,\" Vin said. \"You've spent your entire life serving others. I know of nobody more selfless\nthan you.\"\n\"I do appreciate that sentiment,\" he said. \"But I fear that I must disagree. Lady Vin, we are not a\npeople new to sorrow. You know better than anyone here, I think, the hardships of life in the Final\nEmpire. We have all lost people dear to us. And yet, I seem to be the only one unable to get over my\nloss. I feel childish. Yes, Tindwyl is dead. In all honesty, I did not have much time with her before she did\npass. I have no reason to feel as I do.\n\"Still, I cannot wake up in the morning and not see darkness ahead of me. When I place the\nmetalminds upon my arms, my skin feels cold, and I remember time spent with her. Life lacks all hope. I\nshould be able to move on, but I cannot. I am weak of will, I think.\"\n\"That just isn't true, Sazed,\" Vin said.\n\"I must disagree.\"\n\"Oh?\" Vin asked. \"And if you really were weak of will, would you be able to disagree with me?\"\nSazed paused, then smiled. \"When did you get so good at logic?\"\n\"Living with Elend,\" Vin said with a sigh. \"If you prefer irrational arguments, don't marry a scholar.\"\nI almost did. The thought came to Sazed unbidden, but it quieted his smile nonetheless. Vin must have\nnoticed, for she cringed slightly.\n\"Sorry,\" she said, looking away.\n\"It is all right, Lady Vin,\" Sazed said. \"I just . . . I feel so weak. I cannot be the man my people wish\nme to be. I am, perhaps, the very last of the Keepers. It has been a year since the Inquisitors attacked\nmy homeland, killing even the child Feruchemists, and we have seen no evidence that others of my sect\nsurvived. Others were out of the city, certainly and inevitably, but either Inquisitors found them or other\ntragedy did. There has certainly been enough of that lately, I think.\"\nVin sat with her hands in her lap, looking uncharacteristically weak in the dim light. Sazed frowned at\nthe pained expression on her face. \"Lady Vin?\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"It's just that . . . you've always been the one who gives advice, Sazed. But, now\nwhat I need advice about is you.\"\n\"There is no advice to give, I fear.\"\nThey sat in silence for a few moments.\n\"We found the stockpile,\" Vin said. \"The next-to-last cavern.

Still, have the etching delivered to my\ntent. I promise that I will at least look at it.\"\nShe nodded, then stood. \"Elend's having a meeting tonight. To plan our next moves. He wants you\nthere.\" She trailed a faint perfume as she moved to leave. She paused beside his chair. \"There was a\ntime,\" she said, \"after I'd taken the power at the Well of Ascension, when I thought Elend would die.\"\n\"But he did not,\" Sazed said. \"He lives still.\"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Vin said. \"I thought him dead. I knew he was dying—I held that power, Sazed,\npower you can't imagine. Power you'll never be able to imagine. The power to destroy worlds and\nremake them anew. The power to see and to understand. I saw him, and I knew he would die. And\nknew I held the power in my hands to save him.\"\nSazed looked up.\n\"But I didn't,\" Vin said. \"I let him bleed, and released the power instead. I consigned him to death.\"\n\"How?\" Sazed asked. \"How could you do such a thing?\"\n\"Because I looked into his eyes,\" Vin said, \"and knew it was what he wanted me to do. You gave me\nthat, Sazed. You taught me to love him enough to let him die.\"\nShe left him alone in the tent. A few moments later, he returned to his shaving, and found something\nsitting beside his basin. A small, folded piece of paper.\nIt contained an aged, fading drawing of a strange plant. A flower. The picture had once belonged to\nMare. It had gone from her to Kelsier, and from him to Vin.\nSazed picked it up, wondering what Vin intended to say by leaving him the picture. Finally, he folded it\nup and slipped it into his sleeve, then returned to his shaving.\nThe First Contract, oft spoken of by the kandra, was originally just a series of promises made by\nthe First Generation to the Lord Ruler. They wrote these promises down, and in doing so codified\nthe first kandra laws. They were worried about governing themselves, independently of the Lord\nRuler and his empire.

They sat with their bones of rock, wood, or even metal,\nwaiting for TenSoon's answer.\nKanPaar's question wasn't the one TenSoon had expected.\n\"Yes, I killed a kandra,\" TenSoon said, standing cold and naked on the platform. \"That is not\nforbidden.\"\n\"Need it be forbidden?\" KanPaar accused, pointing. \"Humans kill each other. Koloss kill each other.\nBut they are both of Ruin. We are of Preservation, the chosen of the Father himself. We don't kill one\nanother!\"\nTenSoon frowned. This was a strange line of questioning. Why ask this? he thought. My betrayal of\nall our people is surely a greater sin than the murder of one.\n\"I was compelled by my Contract,\" TenSoon said frankly. \"You must know, KanPaar. You are the\none who assigned me to the man Straff Venture. We all know what kind of person he was.\"\n\"No different from any other man,\" spat one of the Seconds.\nOnce, TenSoon would have agreed. Yet, he knew that there were some humans, at least, who were\ndifferent. He had betrayed Vin, and yet she hadn't hated him for it. She had understood, and had felt\nmercy. Even if they hadn't already become friends, even if he hadn't grown to respect her greatly, that\none moment would have earned her his devoted loyalty.\nShe was counting on him, even if she didn't know it. He stood a little straighter, looking KanPaar in the\neyes. \"I was assigned to the man Straff Venture by paid Contract,\" TenSoon said. \"He gave me over to\nthe whims of his twisted son, Zane.

His instability was well known.\"\n\"So, you didn't argue,\" KanPaar said. \"You simply killed OreSeur. And then you took his place,\npretending to be him.\"\n\"That is what we do,\" TenSoon said with frustration. \"We take the place of others, acting as spies.\nThat is the entire point of the Contract!\"\n\"We do these things to humans,\" snapped another Second. \"This is the first case where a kandra has\nbeen used to imitate another kandra. It is a disturbing precedent you set.\"\nIt was brilliant, TenSoon thought. I hate Zane for making me do it, but I can still see the genius\nin it. Vin never even suspected me. Who would?\n\"You should have refused to do this act,\" KanPaar said. \"You should have pled the need for\nclarification of your Contract. If others were to begin using us in this way, to kill one another, then we\ncould be wiped out in a matter of years!\"\n\"You betrayed us all with your rashness,\" said another.\nAh, TenSoon thought. So that is their plan. They establish me as a traitor first, so that what I say\nlater lacks credibility. He smiled. He was of the Third Generation; it was time he started acting like it.\n\"I betrayed us with my rashness?\" TenSoon asked. \"What of you, glorious Seconds? Who was it who\nallowed a Contract to be assigned to Kelsier himself? You gave a kandra servant to the very man who\nwas planning to kill the Father!\"\nKanPaar stiffened, as if he'd been slapped, translucent face angry in the blue lamplight. \"It is not your\nplace to make accusations, Third!\"\n\"I have no place anymore, it seems,\" TenSoon said. \"None of us do, now that the Father is dead. We\nhave no right to complain, for we helped it happen.\"\n\"How were we to know this man would succeed when others hadn't,\" a Second sputtered. \"He paid\nso well that—\"\nKanPaar cut the other off with a sharp wave of the hand. It wasn't good for those of the Second\nGeneration to defend themselves. However, HunFoor—the kandra who had spoken—hadn't ever really\nfit in with the others of his generation. He was a little more . . . dense."

This is a judgment. Explain your actions, then let the First Generation pronounce your fate!\"\nTenSoon fell silent. It was not time to push. Not yet.\n\"Now,\" KanPaar said, \"this thing you did in taking the place of one of your own brothers is bad\nenough. Need we speak on, or would you accept judgment now?\"\n\"We both know that OreSeur's death has little to do with why I am here,\" TenSoon said.\n\"Very well,\" said KanPaar. \"Let us move on, then. Why don't you tell the First Generation why—if\nyou are such a Contract-abiding kandra—you broke Contract with your master, disobeying his interests\nand helping his enemy instead?\"\nKanPaar's accusation echoed in the room. TenSoon closed his eyes, thinking back to that day over a\nyear ago. He remembered sitting quietly on the floor of Keep Venture, watching as Zane and Vin fought.\nNo. It hadn't been a fight. Zane had been burning atium, which had made him all but invincible. Zane\nhad played with Vin, toying with and mocking her.\nVin hadn't been TenSoon's master—TenSoon had killed her kandra and taken his place, spying on\nVin at Zane's order. Zane. He had been TenSoon's master. He had held TenSoon's Contract.\nBut against all of his training, TenSoon had helped Vin. And, in doing so, he had revealed to her the\ngreat Secret of the kandra. Their weakness: that an Allomancer could use their powers to take complete\ncontrol of a kandra's body. The kandra served their Contracts to keep this Secret hidden—they became\nservants, lest they end up as slaves. TenSoon opened his eyes to the quiet chamber. This was the\nmoment he had been planning for.\n\"I didn't break my Contract,\" he announced.\nKanPaar snorted. \"You said otherwise when you came to us a year ago, Third.\"\n\"I told you what happened,\" TenSoon said, standing tall. \"What I said was not a lie. I helped Vin\ninstead of Zane. Partially because of my actions, my master ended up dead at Vin's feet. But I did not\nbreak my Contract.\"\n\"You imply that Zane wanted you to help his enemy?\" KanPaar said.\n\"No,\" TenSoon said. \"I did not break my Contract because I decided to serve a greater Contract. The\nFirst Contract!\"\n\"The Father is dead!\" one of the Seconds snapped. \"How could you serve our Contract with him?\"\n\"He is dead,\" TenSoon said. \"That is true. But the First Contract did not die with him! Vin, the Heir of\nthe Survivor, was the one who killed the Lord Ruler. She is our Mother now. Our First Contract is with\nher!\"\nHe had expected outcries of blasphemy and condemnation. Instead, he got shocked silence. KanPaar"

The members of the First Generation were silent, as usual,\nsitting in their shadowed alcoves.\nWell, TenSoon thought, I suppose that means I should continue. \"I had to help the woman Vin,\" he\nsaid. \"I could not let Zane kill her, for I had a duty to her—a duty that began the moment she took the\nFather's place.\"\nKanPaar finally found his voice. \"She? Our Mother? She killed the Lord Ruler!\"\n\"And took his place,\" TenSoon said. \"She is one of us, in a way.\"\n\"Nonsense!\" KanPaar said. \"I had expected rationalizations, TenSoon—perhaps even lies. But these\nfantasies? These blasphemies?\"\n\"Have you been outside recently, KanPaar?\" TenSoon asked. \"Have you left the Homeland in the last\ncentury at all? Do you understand what is happening? The Father is dead. The land is in upheaval. While\nreturning to the Homeland a year ago, I saw the changes in the mists. They no longer behave as they\nalways have. We cannot continue as we have. The Second Generation may not yet realize it, but Ruin\nhas come! Life will end. The time that the Worldbringers spoke of—perhaps the time for the\nResolution—is here!\"\n\"You are delusional, TenSoon. You've been amongst the humans too—\"\n\"Tell them what this is all really about, KanPaar,\" TenSoon interrupted, voice rising. \"Don't you want\nmy real sin known? Don't you want the others to hear?\"\n\"Don't force this, TenSoon,\" KanPaar said, pointing again. \"What you've done is bad enough. Don't\nmake it—\"\n\"I told her,\" TenSoon said, cutting him off again. \"I told her our Secret. At the end, she used me. Like\nthe Allomancers of old. She took control of my body, using the Flaw, and she made me fight against\nZane! This is what I've done. I've betrayed us all. She knows—and I'm certain that she has told others.\nSoon they'll all know how to control us. And, do you know why I did it? Is it not the point of this\njudgment for me to speak of my purposes?\"\nHe kept talking, despite the fact that KanPaar tried to speak over him. \"I did it because she has the\nright to know our Secret,\" TenSoon shouted. \"She is the Mother! She inherited everything the Lord\nRuler had. Without her, we have nothing. We cannot create new Blessings, or new kandra, on our own!\nThe Trust is hers, now! We should go to her. If this truly is the end of all things, then the Resolution will\nsoon come. She will—\"\n\"Enough!\" KanPaar bellowed.\nThe chamber fell silent again.\nTenSoon stood, breathing deeply. For a year, trapped in his pit, he'd planned how to proclaim that\ninformation. His people had spent a thousand years, ten generations, following the teachings of the First\nContract. They deserved to hear what had happened to him."

They deserved to hear what had happened to him.\nAnd yet, it felt so . . . inadequate to just scream it out like some raving human. Would any of his\npeople really believe? Would he change anything at all?\n\"You have, by your own admission, betrayed us,\" KanPaar said. \"You've broken Contract, you've\nmurdered one of your own generation, and you've told a human how to dominate us. You demanded\njudgment. Let it come.\"\nTenSoon turned quietly, looking up toward the alcoves where the members of the First Generation\nwatched.\nPerhaps . . . perhaps they'll see that what I say is true. Perhaps my words will shock them, and\nthey'll realize that we need to offer service to Vin, rather than just sit in these caves and wait\nwhile the world ends around us.\nBut, nothing happened. No motion, no sound. At times, TenSoon wondered if anyone still lived up\nthere. He hadn't spoken with a member of the First Generation for centuries—they limited their\ncommunications strictly to the Seconds.\nIf they did still live, none of them took the opportunity to offer TenSoon clemency. KanPaar smiled.\n\"The First Generation has ignored your plea, Third,\" he said. \"Therefore, as their servants, we of the\nSecond Generation will offer judgment on their behalf. Your sentencing will occur in one month's time.\"\nTenSoon frowned. A month? Why wait?\nEither way, it was over. He bowed his head, sighing. He'd had his say. The kandra now knew that\ntheir Secret was out—the Seconds could no longer hide that fact. Perhaps his words would inspire his\npeople to action.\nTenSoon would probably never know.\nRashek moved the Well of Ascension, obviously.\nIt was very clever of him—perhaps the cleverest thing he did. He knew that the power would\none day return to the Well, for power such as this—the fundamental power by which the world\nitself was formed—does not simply run out. It can be used, and therefore diffused, but it will\nalways be renewed.\nSo, knowing that rumors and tales would persist, Rashek changed the very landscape of the\nworld. He put mountains in what became the North, and named that location Terris. Then he\nflattened his true homeland, and built his capital there.\nHe constructed his palace around that room at its heart, the room where he would meditate,\nthe room that was a replica of his old hovel in Terris. A refuge created during the last moments\nbefore his power ran out.\n12\n\"I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM, Elend,\" Vin said, sitting on their bedroll.\n\"Who?\" Elend asked, looking away from the mirror. \"Sazed?\"\nVin nodded. When Elend awoke from their nap, she was already up, bathed, and dressed. He\nworried about her sometimes, working herself as hard as she did. He worried even more now that he too\nwas Mistborn, and understood the limitations of pewter. The metal strengthened the body, letting one\npostpone fatigue—but at a price. When the pewter ran out or was turned off, the fatigue returned,\ncrashing down on you like a collapsing wall."

Elend was burning pewter too, pushing himself, but she seemed to sleep half as\nmuch as he did. She was harder than he was—strong in ways he would never know.\n\"Sazed will deal with his problems,\" Elend said, turning back to his dressing. \"He must have lost people\nbefore.\"\n\"This is different,\" Vin said. He could see her in the reflection, sitting cross-legged behind him in her\nsimple clothing. Elend's stark white uniform was just the opposite. It shone with its gold-painted wooden\nbuttons, intentionally crafted with too little metal in them to be affected by Allomancy. The clothing itself\nhad been made with a special cloth that was easier to scrub clean of ash. Sometimes, he felt guilty at all\nthe work it took to make him look regal. Yet it was necessary. Not for his vanity, but for his image. The\nimage for which his men marched to war. In a land of black, Elend wore white—and became a symbol.\n\"Different?\" Elend asked, doing up the buttons on his jacket sleeves. \"What is different about Tindwyl's\ndeath? She fell during the assault on Luthadel. So did Clubs and Dockson. You killed my own father in\nthat battle, and I beheaded my best friend shortly before it. We've all lost people.\"\n\"He said something like that himself,\" Vin said. \"But, it's more than just one death to him. I think he\nsees a kind of betrayal in Tindwyl's death—he always was the only one of us who had faith. He lost that\nwhen she died, somehow.\"\n\"The only one of us who had faith?\" Elend asked, plucking a wooden, silver-painted pin off his desk\nand affixing it to his jacket. \"What about this?\"\n\"You belong to the Church of the Survivor, Elend,\" Vin said. \"But you don't have faith. Not like Sazed\ndid. It was like . . . he knew everything would turn out all right. He trusted that something was watching\nover the world.\"\n\"He'll deal with it.\"\n\"It's not just him, Elend,\" Vin said. \"Breeze tries too hard.\"\n\"What does that mean?\" Elend asked with amusement.\n\"He Pushes on everyone's emotions,\" Vin said. \"He Pushes too hard, trying to make others happy, and\nhe laughs too hard. He's afraid, worried. He shows it by overcompensating.\"\nElend smiled. \"You're getting as bad as he is, reading everybody's emotions and telling them how\nthey're feeling.\"\n\"They're my friends, Elend,\" Vin said. \"I know them. And, I'm telling you—they're giving up. One by\none, they're beginning to think we can't win this one.\"\nElend fastened the final button, then looked at himself in the mirror. Sometimes, he still wondered if he\nfit the ornate suit, with its crisp whiteness and implied regality. He looked into his own eyes, looking past\nthe short beard, warrior's body, and scarred skin. He looked into those eyes, searching for the king\nbehind them. As always, he wasn't completely impressed with what he saw."

Tindwyl had taught him that. \"Very well,\" he said.\n\"I trust that you're right about the others—I'll do something to fix it.\"\nThat, after all, was his job. The title of emperor carried with it only a single duty.\nTo make everything better.\n\"All right,\" Elend said, pointing to a map of the empire hanging on the wall of the conference tent. \"We\ntimed the arrival and disappearance of the mists each day, then Noorden and his scribes analyzed them.\nThey've given us these perimeters as a guide.\"\nThe group leaned in, studying the map. Vin sat at the back of the tent, as was still her preference.\nCloser to the shadows. Closer to the exit. She'd grown more confident, true—but that didn't make her\ncareless. She liked to be able to keep an eye on everyone in the room, even if she did trust them.\nAnd she did. Except maybe Cett. The obstinate man sat at the front of the group, his quiet teenage son\nat his side, as always. Cett—or, King Cett, one of the monarchs who had sworn allegiance to\nElend—had an unfashionable beard, an even more unfashionable mouth, and two legs that didn't work.\nThat hadn't kept him from nearly conquering Luthadel over a year before.\n\"Hell,\" Cett said. \"You expect us to be able to read that thing?\"\nElend tapped the map with his finger. It was a rough sketch of the empire, similar to the one they'd\nfound in the cavern, only more up to date. It had several large concentric circles inscribed on it.\n\"The outermost circle is the place where the mists have completely taken the land, and no longer leave\nat all during the daylight.\" Elend moved his finger inward to another circle. \"This circle passes through the\nvillage we just visited, where we found the cache. This marks four hours of daylight. Everything inside the\ncircle gets more than four hours. Everything outside of it gets less.\"\n\"And the final circle?\" Breeze asked. He sat with Allrianne as far away from Cett as the tent would\nallow. Cett still had a habit of throwing things at Breeze: insults, for the most part, and occasionally\nknives.\nElend eyed the map. \"Assuming the mists keep creeping toward Luthadel at the same rate, that circle\nrepresents the area that the scribes feel will get enough sunlight this summer to support crops.\"\nThe room fell silent.\nHope is for the foolish, Reen's voice seemed to whisper in the back of Vin's mind. She shook her\nhead. Her brother, Reen, had trained her in the ways of the street and the underground, teaching her to\nbe mistrustful and paranoid. In doing so, he'd also taught her to survive. It had taken Kelsier to show her\nthat it was possible to both trust and survive—and it had been a hard lesson. Even so, she still often\nheard Reen's phantom voice in the back of her mind—more a memory than anything else—whispering"

Even so, she still often\nheard Reen's phantom voice in the back of her mind—more a memory than anything else—whispering\nher insecurities, bringing back the brutal things he had taught her.\n\"That's a fairly small circle, El,\" Ham said, still studying the map. The large-muscled man sat with\nGeneral Demoux between Cett and Breeze. Sazed sat quietly to the side. Vin glanced at him, trying to\njudge if their previous conversation had lifted his depression any, but she couldn't tell.\nThey were a small group: only nine, if one counted Cett's son, Gneorndin. But, it included pretty much\nall that was left of Kelsier's crew. Only Spook, doing reconnaissance in the North, was missing.\nEveryone was focused on the map. The final circle was, indeed, very small—not even as big as the\nCentral Dominance, which held the imperial capital of Luthadel. What the map said, and Elend implied,\nwas that over ninety percent of the empire wouldn't be able to support crops this summer.\n\"Even this small bubble will be gone by next winter,\" Elend said.\nVin watched the others contemplate, and realize—if they hadn't already—the horror of what was upon\nthem. It's like Alendi's logbook said, she thought. They couldn't fight the Deepness with armies. It\ndestroyed cities, bringing a slow, terrible death. They were helpless.\nThe Deepness. That was what they'd called the mists—or, at least, that was what the surviving records\ncalled them. Perhaps the thing they fought, the primal force Vin had released, was behind the obfuscation.\nThere was really no way of knowing for sure what had once been, for the entity had the power to change\nrecords.\n\"All right, people,\" Elend said, folding his arms. \"We need options. Kelsier recruited you because you\ncould do the impossible. Well, our predicament is pretty impossible.\"\n\"He didn't recruit me,\" Cett pointed out. \"I got pulled by my balls into this little fiasco.\"\n\"I wish I cared enough to apologize,\" Elend said, staring at them. \"Come on. I know you have\nthoughts.\"\n\"Well, my dear man,\" Breeze said, \"the most obvious option appears to be the Well of Ascension. It\nseems the power there was built to fight the mists.\"\n\"Or to free the thing hiding in them,\" Cett said.\n\"That doesn't matter,\" Vin said, causing heads to turn. \"There's no power at the Well. It's gone. Used\nup. If it ever returns, it will be in another thousand years, I suspect.\"\n\"That's a little bit long to stretch the supplies in those storage caches,\" Elend said.\n\"What if we grew plants that need very little light?\" Ham asked. As always, he wore simple trousers\nand a vest. He was a Thug, and could burn pewter—which made him resistant to heat and cold. He'd\ncheerfully walk around sleeveless on a day that would send most men running for shelter.\nWell, maybe not cheerfully. Ham hadn't changed overnight, as Sazed had.

He just . . . got carried away. Besides, he resisted this\nthing that we're fighting.\"\n\"This thing?\" Cett asked. \"The mists?\"\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"The thing that was trapped in the Well of Ascension.\"\nIt is called Ruin, Vin thought suddenly.

In\nVetitan, we found large stores of the first eight Allomantic metals. The thing in that last cache might be\njust what we need in order to survive.\"\n\"That's it, then!\" Cett said, smiling broadly through his beard. \"We are marching on Fadrex, aren't\nwe?\"\nElend nodded curtly. \"Yes. The main force of the army will march for the Western Dominance once\nwe break camp here.\"\n\"Ha!\" Cett said. \"Penrod and Janarle can suck on that for a few days.\"\nVin smiled faintly.

Penrod and Janarle were the two other most important kings under Elend's imperial\nrule. Penrod governed Luthadel, which was why he wasn't with them currently, and Janarle ruled the\nNorthern Dominance—the kingdom that included House Venture's hereditary lands.\nThe largest city in the north, however, had been seized in a revolt while Janarle—with Elend's father,\nStraff Venture—had been away laying siege to Luthadel. So far, Elend hadn't been able to spare the\ntroops necessary to take Urteau back from its dissidents, so Janarle ruled in exile, his smaller force of\ntroops used to maintain order in the cities he did control.\nBoth Janarle and Penrod had made a point of finding reasons to keep the main army from marching on\nCett's homeland.\n\"Those bastards won't be at all happy when they hear about this,\" Cett said.\nElend shook his head. \"Does everything you say have to contain one vulgarity or another?\"\nCett shrugged. \"What's the point of speaking if you can't say something interesting?\"\n\"Swearing isn't interesting,\" Elend said.\n\"That's your own damned opinion,\" Cett said, smiling. \"And, you really shouldn't be complaining,\nEmperor. If you think the things I say are vulgar, you've been living in Luthadel far too long. Where I\ncome from, people are embarrassed to use pretty words like 'damn.' \"\nElend sighed. \"Anyway, I—\"\nHe was cut off as the ground began to shake. Vin was on her feet in seconds, looking for danger as\nthe others cursed and reached for stability. She threw back the tent flap, peering through the mists. Yet,\nthe shaking subsided quickly, and it caused very little chaos in the camp, all things considered. Patrols\nmoved about, checking for problems—officers and Allomancers under Elend's command. Most of the\nsoldiers, however, just remained in their tents.\nVin turned back toward the tent's room. A few of the chairs had fallen over, travel furniture disturbed\nby the earthquake. The others slowly returned to their seats. \"Sure have been a lot of those lately,\" Ham\nsaid. Vin met Elend's eyes, and could see concern in them.\nWe can fight armies, we can capture cities, but what of ash, mists, and earthquakes? What\nabout the world falling apart around us?\n\"Anyway,\" Elend said, voice firm despite the concerns Vin knew he must feel, \"Fadrex has to be our\nnext goal. We can't risk missing the cache, and the things it might contain.\"\nLike the atium, Reen whispered in Vin's head as she sat back down. \"Atium,\" she said out loud.\nCett perked up. \"You think it'll be there?\"\n\"There are theories,\" Elend said, eyeing Vin. \"But we have no proof.\"\n\"It will be there,\" she said. It has to be. I don't know why, but we have to have it.\n\"I hope it isn't,\" Cett said. \"I marched halfway across the blasted empire to try and steal that atium—if\nit turns out I left it beneath my own city . . .\""

They had bullied a few cities into joining with him,\nbut they had never actually assaulted a city and taken it by force.\nElend turned, looking back toward the map.

It will be a tough\nstone to break, El.\"\nElend stood quietly for a moment, then eyed Cett, who still looked inordinately pleased with himself.\nThe two seemed to share something—an understanding. Elend was a master of theory, and had probably\nread as much on war as anyone. Cett seemed to have a sixth sense for warfare and tactics, and had\nreplaced Clubs as the empire's prime military strategist.\n\"Siege,\" Cett said.\nElend nodded. \"If King Yomen won't respond to diplomacy, then the only way we'll get in that\ncity—short of killing half our men breaking in—is by besieging it and making him desperate.\"\n\"Do we have time for that?\" Ham asked, frowning.\n\"Besides Urteau,\" Elend said, \"Fadrex City and the surrounding areas are the only major sections of\nthe Inner Dominances that maintain a strong enough force to be threatening. That, plus the cache, means\nwe can't afford to simply leave them alone.\"\n\"Time is on our side, in a way,\" Cett said, scratching his beard. \"You don't just attack a city like\nFadrex, Ham. It has fortifications, one of the few cities besides Luthadel that could repel an army. But,\nsince it's outside of the Central Dominance, it's probably already hurting for food.\"\nElend nodded. \"While we have all of the supplies we found in the storage caches. If we block off the\nhighway, then hold the canal, they'll have to surrender the city eventually. Even if they've found the\ncache—which I doubt—we will be able to outlast them.\""

Even if they've found the\ncache—which I doubt—we will be able to outlast them.\"\nHam frowned. \"I guess. . . .\"\n\"Besides,\" Elend added, \"if things get tough, we do have about twenty thousand koloss we can draw\nupon.\"\nHam raised an eyebrow, though said nothing. The implication was clear. You'd turn koloss against\nother people?\n\"There is another element to this,\" Sazed said softly. \"Something we have, as of yet, not discussed.\"\nSeveral people turned, as if they'd forgotten he was there.\n\"The mists,\" Sazed said. \"Fadrex City lies well beyond the mist perimeter, Emperor Venture. Will you\nsubject your army to fifteen percent casualties before you even arrive at the city?\"\nElend fell quiet. So far, he'd managed to keep most of his soldiers out of the mists. It seemed wrong to\nVin that their army had been protected from the sickness, while the villagers had been forced to go out in\nthe mists. And yet, where they camped, there was still a significant amount of mistless daylight, and they\nalso had enough tents to hold all of the soldiers, something they'd lacked when moving the villagers.\nMists rarely went into buildings, even cloth ones. There had been no reason to risk killing some of the\nsoldiers, since they'd been able to avoid it. It seemed hypocritical to Vin, but so far, it still made sense.\nElend met Sazed's eyes. \"You make a good point,\" he said. \"We can't protect the soldiers from this\nforever. I forced the villagers of Vetitan to immunize themselves; I suspect that I will have to make the\narmy do the same, for the same reasons.\"\nVin sat back quietly. She often wished for the days when she'd had nothing to do with such\ndecisions—or, better yet, when Elend hadn't been forced to make them.\n\"We march for Fadrex,\" Elend said again, turning from the group. He pointed at the map. \"If we're\ngoing to pull through this—and by 'we,' I mean all the people of the New Empire—we're going to need\nto band together and concentrate our populations near the Central Dominance. It will be the only place\nthat can grow food this summer, and we'll need every bit of manpower we can muster to clear ash and\nprepare the fields. That means bringing the people of Fadrex under our protection.\n\"That also means,\" he said, pointing toward the northeastern section of the map, \"that we'll need to\nsuppress the rebellion in Urteau. Not only does the city there contain a storage cache—with grain we\ndesperately need for a second planting down in the Central Dominance—but the city's new rulers are\ngathering strength and an army. Urteau is well within staging distance of Luthadel, as we discovered back\nwhen my father marched on us. I will not have a repeat of that event.\"\n\"We don't have enough troops to march on both fronts at once, El,\" Ham said.\nElend nodded. \"I know. In fact, I'd rather avoid marching on Urteau. That was my father's seat—the\npeople there had good reason to rebel against him. Demoux, report?\"\nDemoux stood. \"We had a steel-inscribed message from Spook while Your Majesty was away,\" he"

There are only five of these caches, and we can't afford to lose one. Who\nknows what we'll eventually discover in Fadrex—it might require us to return to the other caches to find\nsomething we missed.\" He turned, looking at Breeze, then Sazed.\n\"We can't just sneak the food out of Urteau,\" he said. \"If the rebellion in that city spreads, it could\ncause the entire empire to fracture back into splinters. We have to bring the men there to our side.\"\nThe members of the room nodded, as did Vin. They knew from personal experience how much power\na small rebellion could exert on an empire.\n\"The Fadrex siege could take some time,\" Elend said. \"Long before summer arrives, I want you to\nhave secured that northern cache and subdued the rebellion. Send the seed stock down to the Central\nDominance for planting.\"\n\"Don't worry,\" Breeze said. \"I've seen the kinds of governments skaa set up—by the time we get\nthere, the city will probably be on the edge of collapse anyway. Why, they'll likely be relieved to get an\noffer to join the New Empire!\"\n\"Be wary,\" Elend said. \"Spook's reports have been sparse, but it sounds as if tensions in the city are\nextreme. We'll send a few hundred soldiers with you as protection.\" He looked back at the map, eyes\nnarrowing slightly. \"Five caches, five cities. Urteau is part of this all, somehow. We can't afford to let it\nslip away.\"\n\"Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"Is my presence required on that trip?\"\nElend frowned, glancing back at Sazed. \"You have something else you need to be doing, Sazed?\"\n\"I have research I would do,\" the Keeper said.\n\"I respect your wishes, as always,\" Elend said. \"If you think this research is important . . .\"\n\"It's of a personal nature, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said.\n\"Could you do it while helping in Urteau?\" Elend asked. \"You're a Terrisman, which lends you a\ncredibility none of us can claim. Beyond that, people respect and trust you, Sazed—with good reason.\nBreeze, on the other hand, has something of a . . . reputation.\"\n\"I worked hard for it, you know,\" Breeze said.\n\"I'd really like to have you lead that team, Sazed,\" Elend said. \"I can't think of a better ambassador\nthan the Holy Witness himself.\""

I never met him, you know. I\nsaw him once, right before he died, but I never knew him.\"\n\"What's the point?\" Cett asked. \"We've all heard the stories. He's practically a god, if you listen to the\nskaa.\"\n\"Just do as I ask,\" Elend said.\nThe tent was still for a few moments. Finally, Ham spoke. \"Kell was . . . grand. He wasn't just a man,\nhe was bigger than that. Everything he did was large—his dreams, the way he spoke, the way he thought.\n. . .\"\n\"And it wasn't false,\" Breeze added. \"I can tell when a man is being a fake. That's why I started my\nfirst job with Kelsier, actually. Amidst all the pretenders and posturers, he was genuine. Everyone wanted\nto be the best. Kelsier really was.\"\n\"He was a man,\" Vin said quietly. \"Just a man. Yet, you always knew he'd succeed. He made you be\nwhat he wanted you to be.\"\n\"So he could use you,\" Breeze said.\n\"But you were better when he was done with you,\" Ham added.\nElend nodded slowly. \"I wish I could have known him. Early in my career, I always compared myself\nto him. By the time I heard of Kelsier, he was already becoming a legend. It was unfair to force myself to\ntry and be him, but I worried regardless. Anyway, those of you who knew him, maybe you can answer\nanother question for me. What do you think he'd say, if he saw us now?\"\n\"He'd be proud,\" Ham said immediately. \"I mean, we defeated the Lord Ruler, and we built a skaa\ngovernment.\"\n\"What if he saw us at this conference?\" Elend said.\nThe tent fell still again. When someone spoke what they were all thinking, it came from a source Vin\nhadn't expected.\n\"He'd tell us to laugh more,\" Sazed whispered.\nBreeze chuckled. \"He was completely insane, you know. The worse things got, the more he'd joke. I\nremember how chipper he was the very day after one of our worst defeats, when we lost most of our\nskaa army to that fool Yeden.

He planned and executed the overthrow of a thousand-year\nempire—and he did it as a kind of . . . penance for letting his wife die thinking that he hated her. But, he\ndid it all with a smirk on his lips. Like every joke was his way of slapping fate in the face.\"\n\"We need what he had,\" Elend said.\nThe room's eyes turned back toward him.\n\"We can't keep doing this,\" Elend said. \"We bicker amongst ourselves, we mope about, watching the\nash fall, convinced that we're doomed.\"\nBreeze chuckled. \"I don't know if you noticed the earthquake a few minutes ago, my dear man, but the\nworld appears to be ending. That is an indisputably depressing event.\"\nElend shook his head. \"We can survive this. But, the only way that will happen is if our people don't\ngive up. They need leaders who laugh, leaders who feel that this fight can be won. So, this is what I ask\nof you.

How I ended up with you, I'll never know.\"\nBreeze laughed. \"Now, that's a lie, Cett. You know exactly how you ended up joining with us. We\nthreatened to kill you if you didn't!\"\nElend was looking at Vin. She met his eyes, and nodded. It had been a good speech. She wasn't\ncertain if his words would change anything—the crew could never again be the way it had been at the\nbeginning, laughing freely around Clubs's table in the evening hours. However, maybe if they kept\nKelsier's smile in mind, they'd be less likely to forget just why it was they kept struggling on.\n\"All right, people,\" Elend finally said. \"Let's start preparations. Breeze, Sazed, Allrianne—I'll need you\nto talk with the scribes about supply estimates for your trip. Ham, send word to Luthadel and tell Penrod\nto have our scholars work on culturing plants that can grow in very little sunlight. Demoux, pass the word\nto the men.

        "text": "attention had been focused elsewhere lately, and Marsh had been left with more and more time to\nhimself.\nHe still didn't struggle. Struggle just brought Ruin's attention.\nIsn't that what I want? he thought. To be controlled? When Ruin forced him to see things its way,\nthe dying world seemed wonderful. That bliss was far superior to the dread he felt while sitting on the\nstump, slowly being buried in ash.\nNo. No, that's not what I want! It was bliss, true, but it was false. As he had once struggled against\nRuin, he now struggled against his own sense of inevitability.\nWhat am I missing? he thought again, distracting himself. The koloss army—three hundred thousand\nstrong—hadn't moved in weeks. Its members were slowly, yet relentlessly, killing each other. It seemed a\nwaste of resources to let the army stagnate, even if the creatures could apparently eat even the dead\nplants beneath the ash to survive.\nThey can't possibly live on that for long, can they? He didn't know much about the koloss, despite\nspending the better part of a year with them. They appeared to be able to eat almost anything, as if just\nfilling their stomachs were more important than actual nutrition.\nWhat was Ruin waiting for? Why not take his army in and attack? Marsh was familiar enough with\nFinal Empire geography to recognize that he was stationed in the North, near Terris. Why not move\ndown and strike Luthadel?\nThere were no other Inquisitors in the camp. Ruin had called them to other tasks, leaving Marsh alone.\nOf all the Inquisitors, Marsh had been given the largest number of new spikes—he had ten new ones\nplanted at various places in his body. That ostensibly made him the most powerful of the Inquisitors. Why\nleave him behind?\nYet . . . what does it matter? he wondered. The end has come. There is no way to beat Ruin. The\nworld will end.\nHe felt guilty for the thought. If he could have turned his eyes downward in shame, he would have.\nThere had been a time when he'd run the entire skaa rebellion. Thousands had looked to him for\nleadership. And then . . . Kelsier had been captured. As had Mare, the woman both Kelsier and Marsh\nhad loved.\nWhen Kelsier and Mare had been cast into the Pits of Hathsin, Marsh had left the rebellion. His\nrationale had been simple. If the Lord Ruler could catch Kelsier—the most brilliant thief of his time—then\nhe would catch Marsh eventually too. It hadn't been fear that had driven Marsh's retirement, but simple\nrealism. Marsh had always been practical. Fighting had proven useless. So why do it?\nAnd then Kelsier had returned and done what a thousand years of rebellious skaa hadn't been able to:\nHe'd overthrown the empire, facilitating the death of the Lord Ruler himself.\nThat should have been me, Marsh thought. I served the rebellion all my life, then gave up just\nbefore they finally won.\nIt was a tragedy, and it was made worse by the fact that Marsh was doing it again. He was giving up.\nDamn you, Kelsier! he thought with frustration. Can't you leave me be even in death?"

Can't you leave me be even in death?\nAnd yet, one harrowing, undeniable fact remained. Mare had been right. She had chosen Kelsier over\nMarsh. And then, when both men had been forced to deal with her death, one had given up.\nThe other had made her dreams come true.\nMarsh knew why Kelsier had decided to overthrow the Final Empire. It hadn't been for the money,\nthe fame, or even—as most suspected—for revenge. Kelsier knew Mare's heart. He'd known that she\ndreamed of days when plants flourished and the sky was not red. She'd always carried with her that little\npicture of a flower, a copied copy of a copy—a depiction of something that had been lost to the Final\nEmpire long ago.\nBut, Marsh thought bitterly, you didn't make her dreams a reality, Kelsier. You failed. You killed\nthe Lord Ruler, but that didn't fix anything. It made things worse!\nThe ash continued to fall, blowing around Marsh in a lazy breeze. Koloss grunted, and in the near\ndistance one screamed as his companion killed him.\nKelsier was dead now. But, he had died for her dream. Mare had been right to pick him, but she was\ndead too. Marsh wasn't. Not yet. I can fight still, he told himself. But how? Even moving his finger\nwould draw Ruin's attention.\nAlthough, during the last few weeks, he hadn't struggled at all. Perhaps that was why Ruin decided it\ncould leave Marsh alone for so long. The creature—or the force, or whatever it was—wasn't\nomnipotent. Marsh suspected, however, that it could move about freely, watching the world and seeing\nwhat was happening in various parts of it. No walls could block its view—it seemed to be able to watch\nanything.\nExcept a man's mind.\nPerhaps . . . perhaps if I stop struggling long enough, I'll be able to surprise it when I finally do\ndecide to strike.\nIt seemed as good a plan as any. And, Marsh knew exactly what he would do, when the time came.\nHe'd remove Ruin's most useful tool. He'd pull the spike from his back and kill himself. Not out of\nfrustration, and not out of despair. He knew that he had some important part to play in Ruin's plans. If he\nremoved himself at the right time, it could give the others the chance they needed.\nIt was all he could give. Yet, it seemed fitting, and his new confidence made him wish he could stand\nand face the world with pride. Kelsier had killed himself to secure freedom for the skaa. Marsh would do\nthe same—and in doing so, hope to help save the world itself from destruction.\nPART TWO\nCLOTH AND GLASS\nRuin's consciousness was trapped by the Well of Ascension, kept mostly impotent.

He never turned it off anymore. He just left it\non, letting it roar, a fire within him. Tin was one of the slowest-burning of metals, and it wasn't difficult to\nobtain in the amounts necessary for Allomancy.\nHe moved down the silent street. Even with Kelsier's now-famous proclamations that the skaa need\nnot fear the mists, few people went out at night. For, at night, the mists came. Deep and mysterious, dark\nand omnipresent, the mists were one of the great constants of the Final Empire. They came every night.\nThicker than a simple fog, they swirled in definite patterns—almost as if the different banks, streams, and\nfronts of mist were living things. Almost playful, yet enigmatic.\nTo Spook, however, they were barely an obstruction anymore. He'd always been told not to flare his\ntin too much; he'd been warned not to become dependent upon it. It would do dangerous things to his\nbody, people said. And, the truth was, they were right. He had flared his tin nonstop for a year\nstraight—never letting up, keeping his body in a constant state of super-heightened senses—and it had\nchanged him. He worried that the changes would, indeed, be dangerous.\nBut he needed them, for the people of Urteau needed him.\nStars blazed in the sky above him like a million tiny suns. They shone through the mists, which\nhad—during the last year—become diaphanous and weak. At first, Spook had thought the world itself\nwas changing. Then he had realized that it was just his perception. Somehow, by flaring tin for so long, he\nhad permanently enhanced his senses to a point far beyond what other Allomancers could attain.\nHe'd almost stopped. The flared tin had begun as a reaction to Clubs's death. He still felt terrible about\nthe way he'd escaped Luthadel, leaving his uncle to die. During those first few weeks, Spook had flared\nhis metals as almost a penance—he'd wanted to feel everything around him, take it all in, even though it\nwas painful. Perhaps because it was painful.\nBut then he'd started to change, and that had worried him. But, the crew always talked about how\nhard Vin pushed herself. She rarely slept, using pewter to keep herself awake and alert. Spook didn't\nknow how that worked—he was no Mistborn, and could only burn one metal—but he figured that if\nburning his one metal could give him an advantage, he'd better take it. Because they were going to need\nevery advantage they could get.\nThe starlight was like daylight to him.

His skin had become so sensitive\nthat each pebble in the ground—each crack, each flake of stone—felt like a knife jabbing him through the\nsoles of his shoes. The chill spring air seemed freezing, and he wore a thick cloak.\nHowever, he had concluded that these nuisances were small prices to pay for the opportunity to\nbecome . . . whatever it was he had become. As he moved down the street, he could hear people\nshuffling and turning in their beds, even through their walls. He could sense a footstep from yards away.\nHe could see on a dark night as no other human ever had.\nPerhaps he'd find a way to become useful to the others. Always before, he'd been the least important\nmember of the crew. The dismissible boy who ran errands or kept watch while the others made plans.\nHe didn't resent them for that—they'd been right to give him such simple duties. Because of his street\ndialect, he'd been difficult to understand, and while all the other members of the crew had been\nhand-picked by Kelsier, Spook had joined by default since he was Clubs's nephew.\nSpook sighed, shoving his hands in his trouser pockets as he walked down the too-bright street. He\ncould feel each and every thread in the fabric.\nDangerous things were happening, he knew that: the way the mists lingered during the day, the way the\nground shook as if it were a sleeping man, periodically suffering a terrible dream. Spook worried he\nwouldn't be of much help in the critical days to come. A little over a year before, his uncle had died after\nSpook fled the city. Spook had run out of fear, but also out of a knowledge of his own impotence. He\nwouldn't have been able to help during the siege.\nHe didn't want to be in that position again. He wanted to be able to help, somehow. He wouldn't run\ninto the woods, hiding while the world ended around him. Elend and Vin had sent him to Urteau to gather\nas much information as he could about the Citizen and his government there, and so Spook intended to\ndo his best. If that meant pushing his body beyond what was safe, so be it.\nHe approached a large intersection. He looked both ways down the intersecting streets—the view\nclear as day to his eyes. I may not be Mistborn, and I may not be emperor, he thought. But I'm\nsomething. Something new. Something Kelsier would be proud of.\nMaybe this time I can help.\nHe saw no motion in either direction, so he slipped onto the street and moved to the north. It felt\nstrange, sometimes, slinking quietly along a street that seemed brightly lit. Yet, he knew that to others it\nwould be dark, with only starlight to see by, the mist blocking and obscuring as ever. Tin helped an\nAllomancer pierce the mists, and Spook's increasingly sensitive eyes were even better at this.

How could someone not hear that clanking of armor, not\nfeel that clatter of feet on the cobblestones? He froze, standing with his back to the earthen wall\nbordering the street, watching for the patrol.\nThey bore a torch—to Spook's enhanced eyes, it looked like a blazing beacon of near-blinding\nbrilliance. The torch marked them as fools. Its light wouldn't help—just the reverse. The light reflected off\nthe mists, enveloping the guards in a little bubble of light that ruined their night vision.\nSpook stayed where he was, motionless. The patrol clanked forward, moving down the street. They\npassed within a few feet of him, but didn't notice him standing there. There was something . . .\ninvigorating about being able to watch, feeling at once completely exposed and perfectly unseen. It made\nhim wonder why the new Urteau government even bothered with patrols. Of course, the government's\nskaa officials would have very little experience with the mists.\nAs the guard patrol disappeared around a corner—bearing their glaring torch with them—Spook\nturned back to his task. The Citizen would be meeting with his aides this night, if his schedule held.\nSpook intended to listen in on that conversation. He moved carefully down the street.\nNo city could compare with Luthadel in sheer size, but Urteau made a respectable effort. As the\nhereditary home of the Venture line, it had once been a much more important—and\nwell-maintained—city than it was now. That decline had begun even before the death of the Lord Ruler.\nThe most obvious sign of that was the roadway Spook now walked on. Once, the city had been\ncrisscrossed with canals that had functioned as watery streets. Those canals had gone dry some time ago,\nleaving the city crossed by deep, dusty troughs that grew muddy when it rained. Rather than filling them\nin, the people had simply begun to use the empty bottoms as roads.\nThe street Spook now used had once been a wide waterway capable of accommodating even large\nbarges. Ten-foot-high walls rose on either side of the sunken street, and buildings loomed above, built up\nagainst the lip of the canal. Nobody had been able to give Spook a definite, or consistent, answer as to\nwhy the canals had emptied—some blamed earthquakes, others blamed droughts. The fact remained,\nhowever, that in the hundred years since the canals had lost their water, nobody had found an economical\nway to refill them.\nAnd so, Spook continued down the \"street,\" feeling like he was walking in a deep slot. Numerous\nladders—and the occasional ramp or flight of stairs—led up to the sidewalks and the buildings above,\nbut few people ever walked up there. The streetslots—as the city's residents called them—had simply\nbecome normal.\nSpook caught a scent of smoke as he walked. He glanced up, and noted a gap in the horizon of\nbuildings. Recently, a building on this street had been burned to the ground. The house of a nobleman.\nHis sense of smell, like his other senses, was incredibly sensitive.

So it was possible that he was smelling\nsmoke from long ago, when buildings had burned during the initial rampages following Straff Venture's\ndeath. And yet, the scent seemed too strong for that. Too recent.\nSpook hurried on. Urteau was dying slowly, decaying, and a lot of the blame could be placed on its\nruler, the Citizen. Long ago, Elend had given a speech to the people of Luthadel. It had been the night\nwhen the Lord Ruler had died, the night of Kelsier's rebellion. Spook remembered Elend's words well,\nfor the man had spoken of hatred, rebellion, and the dangers associated with them. He'd warned that if\nthe people founded their new government on hatred and bloodshed, it would consume itself with fear,\njealousy, and chaos.\nSpook had been in that audience, listening. He now saw that Elend was right. The skaa of Urteau had\noverthrown their noble rulers, and—in a way—Spook was proud of them for doing so. He felt a growing\nfondness for the city, partially because of how devoutly they tried to follow what the Survivor had taught.\nYet, their rebellion hadn't stopped with the ousting of the nobility. As Elend had predicted, the city had\nbecome a place of fear and death.\nThe question was not why it had happened, but how to stop it.\nFor now, that wasn't Spook's job. He was just supposed to gather information. Only\nfamiliarity—gained during weeks spent investigating the city—let him know when he was getting close,\nfor it was frustratingly difficult to keep track of where one was down in the streetslots. At first, he had\ntried to stay out of them, slipping through smaller alleyways above. Unfortunately, the slots networked the\nentire city, and he'd wasted so much time going up and down that he'd eventually realized that the slots\nreally were the only viable way of getting around.\nUnless one were Mistborn, of course. Unfortunately, Spook couldn't hop from building to building on\nlines of Allomantic power. He was stuck in the slots. He made the best of it.\nHe picked a ladder and swung onto it, climbing up. Though he wore leather gloves, he could feel the\ngrain of the wood. Up top, there was a small sidewalk running along the streetslot. An alleyway extended\nahead of him, leading into a cluster of houses. A building at the end of the small street was his goal, but he\ndid not move toward it. Instead, he waited quietly, searching for the signs he knew were there. Sure\nenough, he caught a rustling motion in a window a few buildings down. His ears caught the sound of\nfootsteps in another building. The street ahead of him was being watched.\nSpook turned aside. While the sentries were very careful to watch the alleyway, they unintentionally\nleft another avenue open: their own buildings. Spook crept to the right, moving on feet that could feel\neach pebble beneath them, listening with ears that could hear a man's increased breathing as he spotted\nsomething unusual. He rounded the outside of a building, turning away from the watchful eyes, and\nentering a dead-end alleyway on the other side. There, he lay a hand against the wall of the building."

        "text": "something unusual. He rounded the outside of a building, turning away from the watchful eyes, and\nentering a dead-end alleyway on the other side. There, he lay a hand against the wall of the building.\nThere were vibrations inside the room; it was occupied, so he moved on. The next room alerted him\nimmediately, as he heard whispered voices inside. The third room, however, gave him nothing. No\nvibrations of motion. No whispers. Not even the muted thudding of a heartbeat—something he could\nsometimes hear, if the air were still enough. Taking a deep breath, Spook quietly worked open the\nwindow lock and slipped inside.\nIt was a sleeping chamber, empty as he'd anticipated. He'd never come through this particular room\nbefore. His heart thumped as he closed the shutters, then slipped across the floor. Despite the near-total\ndarkness, he had no trouble seeing in the room. It barely seemed dim to him.\nOutside the room, he found a more familiar hallway. He easily snuck past two guard rooms, where\nmen watched the street outside. There was a thrill in doing these infiltrations. Spook was in one of the\nCitizen's own guardhouses, steps away from large numbers of armed soldiers. They should have taken\ncare to guard their own building better.\nHe crept up the stairs, making his way to a small, rarely used room on the third floor. He checked for\nvibrations, then slipped inside. The austere chamber was piled with a mound of extra bedrolls and a dusty\nstack of uniforms. Spook smiled as he moved across the floor, stepping carefully and quietly, his highly\nsensitive toes able to feel loose, squeaky, or warped boards. He sat down on the windowsill itself,\nconfident that nobody outside would be able to see well enough to spot him.\nThe Citizen's house lay a few yards away. Quellion decried ostentation, and had chosen for his\nheadquarters a structure of modest size. It had probably once been a minor nobleman's home, and had\nonly a small yard, which Spook could easily see into from his vantage. The building itself glowed, light\nstreaking from every crack and window. It was as if the building were filled with some awesome power,\nand on the verge of bursting.\nBut, then, that was just the way that Spook's overflared tin made him see any building that had lights\non inside.\nSpook leaned back, legs up on the windowsill, back against the frame. The window contained neither\nglass nor shutters, though there were nail holes on the side of the wood, indicating that there had once\nbeen something there. The reason the shutters had been removed didn't matter to Spook—the lack of\nthem meant that this room was unlikely to be entered at night. Mists had already claimed the room,\nthough they were so faint to Spook's eyes that he had had trouble seeing them.\nFor a while, nothing happened. The building and grounds below remained silent and still in the night air.\nEventually, however, she appeared.\nSpook perked up, watching the young woman leave the house and enter the garden. She had on a\nlight brown skaa's dress—a garment she somehow wore with striking elegance. Her hair was darker than\nthe dress, but not by much.

Spook had seen very few people with her shade of deep auburn hair—at\nleast, few people who had been able to keep it clean of ash and soot.\nEveryone in the city knew of Beldre, the Citizen's sister, though few had ever seen her. She was said\nto be beautiful—and in this case, the rumors were true. However, nobody had ever mentioned her\nsadness. With his tin flared so high, Spook felt like he was standing next to her. He could see her deep,\nsorrowful eyes, reflecting light from the shining building behind her.\nThere was a bench in the yard. It sat before a small shrub. It was the only plant left in the garden; the\nrest had been torn up and plowed under, leaving behind blackish brown earth. From what Spook had\nheard, the Citizen had declared that ornamental gardens were of the nobility. He claimed that such places\nhad only been possible through the sweat of skaa slaves—just another way the nobility had achieved high\nlevels of luxury by creating equally high levels of work for their servants.\nWhen the people of Urteau had whitewashed the city's murals and shattered its stained-glass\nwindows, they had also torn up all the ornamental gardens.\nBeldre sat down on her bench, hands held motionless in her lap, looking down at the sad shrub.\nSpook tried to convince himself that she wasn't the reason why he made certain to always sneak in and\nlisten to the Citizen's evening conferences, and he was mostly successful. These were some of the best\nspying opportunities Spook got. Being able to see Beldre was simply a bonus. Not that he cared that\nmuch, of course. He didn't even know her.\nHe thought that even as he sat there, staring down at her, wishing he had some way to talk to her.\nBut, this wasn't the time for that. Beldre's exile to the garden meant that her brother's meeting was\nabout to start. He always kept her near, but apparently didn't want her hearing state secrets.\nUnfortunately for him, his window opened toward Spook's vantage point. No normal man—not even an\nordinary Tineye or Mistborn—could have heard what was being said inside. But Spook wasn't, by any\nstretched definition of the word, normal.\nI won't be useless anymore, he thought with determination as he listened for words spoken in\nconfidence. They passed through the walls, across the short space, and arrived at his ears.\n\"All right, Olid,\" said a voice. \"What news?\" The voice was, by now, familiar to Spook. Quellion, the\nCitizen of Urteau.\n\"Elend Venture has conquered another city,\" said a second voice—Olid, the foreign minister.\n\"Where?\" Quellion demanded. \"What city?\"\n\"An unimportant one,\" Olid said. \"To the south. Barely five thousand people.\"\n\"It makes no sense,\" said a third voice. \"He immediately abandoned the city, taking its populace with\nhim.\"\n\"But he got another koloss army, somehow,\" Olid added.\nGood, Spook thought. The fourth storage cavern was theirs. Luthadel wouldn't starve for a while yet."

Luthadel wouldn't starve for a while yet.\nThat only left two to secure—the one here in Urteau, and the last one, wherever that turned out to be.\n\"A tyrant needs no real reason for what he does,\" Quellion said. He was a young man, but not foolish.\nAt times, he sounded like other men Spook had known. Wise men. The difference, then, was one of\nextremity.\nOr, perhaps, timing?\n\"A tyrant simply conquers for the thrill of control,\" Quellion continued. \"Venture isn't satisfied with the\nlands he's taken—he never will be. He'll just keep on conquering. Until he comes for us.\"\nThe room fell silent.\n\"He's reportedly sending an ambassador to Urteau,\" the third voice said. \"A member of the Survivor's\nown crew.\"\nSpook perked up.\nQuellion snorted. \"One of the liars? Coming here?\"\n\"To offer us a treaty, the rumors say,\" Olid said.\n\"So?\" Quellion asked. \"Why do you mention this, Olid? Do you think we should make a pact with the\ntyrant?\"\n\"We can't fight him, Quellion,\" Olid said.\n\"The Survivor couldn't fight the Lord Ruler,\" Quellion said. \"But he did anyway. He died, but still won,\ngiving the skaa courage to rebel and overthrow the nobility.\"\n\"Until that bastard Venture took control,\" the third voice said.\nThe room fell silent again.\n\"We can't give in to Venture,\" Quellion finally said. \"I will not hand this city to a nobleman, not after\nwhat the Survivor did for us. Of all the Final Empire, only Urteau achieved Kelsier's goal of a skaa-ruled\nnation. Only we burned the homes of the nobility. Only we cleansed our town of them and their society.\nOnly we obeyed. The Survivor will watch over us.\"\nSpook shivered quietly. It felt very strange to be hearing men he didn't know speak of Kelsier in such\ntones. Spook had walked with Kelsier, learned from Kelsier. What right did these men have to speak as\nif they had known the man who had become their Survivor?\nThe conversation turned to matters more mundane. They discussed new laws that would forbid certain\nkinds of clothing once favored by the nobility, and then made a decision to give more funding to the\ngenealogical survey committee. They needed to root out any in the city who were hiding noble parentage.\nSpook took notes so he could pass them on to the others. However, he had trouble keeping his eyes\nfrom trailing back down to the young woman in the garden.\nWhat brings her such sorrow? he wondered. A part of him wanted to ask—to be brash, as the\nSurvivor would have been, and hop down to demand of this solemn, solitary girl why she stared at that\nplant with such melancholy. In fact, he found himself moving to stand before he caught himself.\nHe might be unique, he might be powerful, but—as he had to remind himself again—he was no\nMistborn. His was the way of silence and stealth."

During the thousand years\nbefore the Collapse, they pushed the ash into rivers, piled it up outside of cities, and generally just\nlet it be. They never understood that without the microbes and plants Rashek had developed to\nbreak down the ash particles, the land would quickly have been buried.\nThough, of course, that did eventually happen anyway.\n15\nTHE MISTS BURNED. Bright, flaring, lit by the red sunlight, they seemed a fire that enveloped her.\nMist during the day was unnatural. But even the nightmists didn't seem to be Vin's anymore. Once,\nthey had shadowed and protected her. Now she found them increasingly alien. When she used\nAllomancy it seemed that the mists pulled away from her slightly—like a wild beast shying away from a\nbright light.\nShe stood alone before the camp, which was silent despite the fact that the sun had risen hours ago.\nSo far, Elend continued to keep his army protected from the mists by ordering them to remain in their\ntents. Ham argued that exposing them wasn't necessary, but Vin's instinct said that Elend would stick to\nhis plan to order his soldiers into the mist. They needed to be immune.\nWhy? Vin thought, looking up through the sunlit mists. Why have you changed? What is different?\nThe mists danced around her, moving in their usual, strange pattern of shifting streams and swirls. It\nseemed to Vin that they began to move more rapidly. Quivering. Vibrating.\nThe sun seemed to grow hotter, and the mists finally retreated, vanishing like water evaporating on a\nwarming pan. The sunlight hit her like a wave, and Vin turned, watching the mists go, their death like an\nechoing scream.\nThey're not natural, Vin thought as guards called the all clear. The camp immediately began to shift\nand move, men striding from tents, going about the morning's activity with a flair of urgency. Vin stood at\nthe head of the camp, dirt road beneath her feet, motionless canal to her right. Both seemed more real\nnow that the mists were gone.\nShe had asked Sazed and Elend their opinions of the mists—whether they were natural or . . .\nsomething else. And both men, like the scholars they were, had quoted theories to support both sides of\nthe argument. Sazed, at least, had eventually made a decision—he'd come down on the side of the mists\nbeing natural.\nEven the way that the mists choke some people, leaving others alive, could be explained, Lady\nVin, he had explained. After all, insect stings kill some people, while barely bothering others.\nVin wasn't that interested in theories and arguments.

She\nfelt them, a sense that seemed to have grown even more potent on the day she'd touched the power of\nthe Well of Ascension.\nThey disappeared too quickly. When they burned away in the sunlight, they withdrew like a person\nfleeing for safety. Like . . . a man who used all of his strength fighting, then finally gave up to retreat. In\naddition, the mists didn't appear indoors. A simple tent was enough to protect the men inside. It was as if\nthe mists somehow understood that they were excluded, unwelcome.\nVin glanced back toward the sun, glowing like a scarlet ember behind the dark haze of the upper\natmosphere. She wished TenSoon were there, so she could talk to him about her worries. She missed\nthe kandra a great deal, more than she'd ever assumed that she would. His simple frankness had been a\ngood match to her own. She still didn't know what had happened to him after he'd returned to his people;\nshe'd tried to find another kandra to deliver a message for her, but the creatures had become very scarce\nlately.\nShe sighed and turned, walking quietly back into camp.\nIt was impressive how quickly the men managed to get the army moving. They spent the mornings\nsequestered inside their tents, caring for armor and weapons, the cooks preparing what they could. By\nthe time Vin had crossed a short distance, cooking fires had burst alight, and tents began to collapse,\nsoldiers working quickly to prepare for departure.\nAs she passed, some of the men saluted. Others bowed their heads in reverence. Still others glanced\naway, looking uncertain. Vin didn't blame them. Even she wasn't sure what her place was in the army. As\nElend's wife, she was technically their empress, though she wore no royal garb. To many, she was a\nreligious figure, the Heir of the Survivor. She didn't really want that title either.\nShe found Elend and Ham conversing outside of the imperial tent, which was in an early stage of\ndisassembly. Though they stood out in the open, their mannerisms completely nonchalant, Vin was\nimmediately struck by how far the two men were standing from the workers, as if Elend and Ham didn't\nwant the men to hear. Burning tin, she could make out what they were saying long before she reached\nthem.\n\"Ham,\" Elend said quietly, \"you know I'm right. We can't keep doing this. The further we penetrate\ninto the Western Dominance, the more daylight we'll lose to the mists.\"\nHam shook his head. \"You'd really stand by and watch your own soldiers die, El?\"\nElend's face grew hard, and he met Vin's eyes as she joined them. \"We can't afford to wait out the\nmists every morning.\"\n\"Even if it saves lives?\" Ham asked.\n\"Slowing down costs lives,\" Elend said. \"Each hour we spend out here brings the mists closer to the\nCentral Dominance.

Elend is right. We\ncan't have our entire army dependent upon the whims of the mists. We'd be exposed—if someone\nattacked us in the morning, our men would either have to respond and get struck down by the mists, or\nhide in their tents and wait.\"\nHam frowned, then excused himself, tromping through the fallen ash to help a group of soldiers pack\naway their tents. Vin stepped up beside Elend, watching the large soldier go.\n\"Kelsier was wrong about him,\" she finally said.\n\"Who?\" Elend asked. \"Ham?\"\nVin nodded. \"At the end—after Kelsier died—we found a last note from him. He said that he'd\nchosen the members of the crew to be leaders in his new government. Breeze to be an ambassador,\nDockson to be a bureaucrat, and Ham to be a general. The other two fit their roles perfectly, but Ham . .\n.\"\n\"He gets too involved,\" Elend said. \"He has to know each man he commands personally or it makes\nhim uncomfortable. And, when he knows them all that well, he grows attached.\"\nVin nodded quietly, watching Ham begin to laugh and work with the soldiers.\n\"Listen to us,\" Elend said, \"callously talking about the lives of those who follow us. Perhaps it would be\nbetter to grow attached, like Ham. Maybe then I wouldn't be so quick to order people to their deaths.\"\nVin glanced at Elend, concerned at the bitterness in his voice. He smiled, trying to cover it up, then\nglanced away. \"You need to do something with that koloss of yours. He's been poking around the camp,\nscaring the men.\"\nVin frowned. As soon as she thought of the creature, she became aware of where it was—near the\nedge of the camp. It was always under her command, but she could only take direct, full control of it\nwhen she concentrated. Otherwise, it would follow her general orders—staying in the area, not killing\nanything.\n\"I should go make sure the barges are ready to move,\" Elend said. He glanced at her, and when she\ndidn't indicate that she'd go with him, he gave her a quick kiss, then departed.\nVin moved through the camp again. Most of the tents were down and stowed, and the soldiers were\nmaking quick work of their food. She passed out of the perimeter, and found Human sitting quietly, ash\ndrifting slightly against his legs. He watched the camp with red eyes, his face broken by the ripped skin\nwhich hung from his right eye down to the corner of his mouth.\n\"Human,\" she said, folding her arms.\nHe looked over at her, then stood, ash falling from his eleven-foot, overly muscled blue figure. Even\nwith the number of creatures she'd killed, even knowing she controlled this one completely, Vin had a\nmoment of reflexive fear as she stood before the massive beast with its tightly stretched skin and bleeding\nrips.\n\"Why did you come to camp?\" she said, shaking off her panic."

You have to stay with the\nother koloss.\"\nHuman turned, glancing toward the south, where the koloss army waited, separate from the humans.\nThey remained under Elend's control, twenty thousand in number, now that they'd picked up the ten\nthousand that had been waiting with the main bulk of the army. It made more sense to leave them under\nElend's control, since—in terms of raw power—he was a much stronger Allomancer than Vin.\nHuman looked back at Vin. \"Why?\"\n\"Why do you have to stay with the others?\" Vin asked. \"Because you make the people in the camp\nuncomfortable.\"\n\"Then they should attack me,\" Human said.\n\"That's why you're not a human,\" Vin said. \"We don't attack people just because they make us\nuncomfortable.\"\n\"No,\" Human said. \"You make us kill them instead.\"\nVin paused, cocking her head. Human, however, just looked away, staring at the human camp again.\nHis beady red eyes made his face hard to read, but Vin almost sensed a . . . longing in his expression.\n\"You're one of us,\" Human said.\nVin looked up. \"Me?\"\n\"You're like us,\" he said. \"Not like them.\"\n\"Why do you say that?\" Vin asked.\nHuman looked down at her. \"Mist,\" he said.\nVin felt a momentary chill, though she had no real idea why. \"What do you mean?\"\nHuman didn't respond.\n\"Human,\" she said, trying another tactic. \"What do you think of the mists?\"\n\"They come at night.\"\nVin nodded. \"Yes, but what do you think of them. Your people. Do they fear the mists? Does it ever\nkill them?\"\n\"Swords kill,\" Human said. \"Rain doesn't kill. Ash doesn't kill. Mist doesn't kill.\"\nFairly good logic, Vin thought. A year ago, I would have agreed with it. She was about to give up\non the line of reasoning, but Human continued.\n\"I hate it,\" he said.\nVin paused.\n\"I hate it because it hates me,\" Human said. He looked at her. \"You feel it.\"\n\"Yes,\" Vin said, surprising herself. \"I do.\"\nHuman regarded her, a line of blood trailing out of the ripped skin near his eye, running stark down his\nblue skin, mixing with flakes of ash. Finally, he nodded, as if giving approval to her honest reply.\nVin shivered. The mist isn't alive, she thought. It can't hate me. I'm imagining things.\nBut . . . once, years ago, she had drawn upon the mists. When fighting the Lord Ruler, she had\nsomehow gained a power over them. It had been as if she'd used the mist itself to fuel her Allomancy\ninstead of metals. It was only with that power that she'd been able to defeat the Lord Ruler."

It was only with that power that she'd been able to defeat the Lord Ruler.\nThat had been a long time ago, and she'd never been able to replicate the event. She'd tried time and\nagain over the years, and after so many failures, she was beginning to think that she must have been\nmistaken. Certainly, in more recent times, the mists had been unfriendly. She tried to keep telling herself\nthat there was nothing supernatural about it, but she knew that wasn't true. What of the mist spirit, the\nthing that had tried to kill Elend—and then had saved him by showing her how to make him into an\nAllomancer? It was real, of that she was certain, even if she hadn't seen it in over a year.\nWhat of the hesitance she felt toward the mists, the way they pulled away from her? The way they\nstayed out of buildings, and the way they killed. It all seemed to point to what Human had said. The\nmists—the Deepness—hated her. And, finally, she acknowledged what she had been resisting for so\nlong.\nThe mists were her enemy.\nThey are called Allomantic savants. Men or women who flare their metals so long, and so hard,\nthat the constant influx of Allomantic power transforms their very physiology.\nIn most cases, with most metals, the effects of this are very slight. Bronze burners, for instance,\noften become bronze savants without knowing it. Their range is expanded from burning the metal\nso long. Becoming a pewter savant is dangerous, as it requires pushing the body so hard in a state\nwhere one cannot feel exhaustion or pain. Most accidentally kill themselves before the process is\ncomplete, and in my opinion, the benefit isn't worth the effort.\nTin savants, however . . . now, they are something special. Endowed with senses beyond what\nany normal Allomancer would need—or even want—they become slaves to what they touch, hear,\nsee, smell, and taste. Yet, the abnormal power of these senses gives them a distinct, and\ninteresting, advantage.\nOne could argue that, like an Inquisitor who has been transformed by a Hemalurgic spike, the\nAllomantic savant is no longer even human.\n16\nSPOOK AWOKE TO DARKNESS.\nThat was happening less and less frequently lately. He could feel the blindfold on his face, tied tightly\nacross his eyes and over his ears. It dug into his overly sensitive skin, but it was far better than the\nalternative. Starlight was as bright as the sun to his eyes, and footsteps in the hallway outside his room\ncould sound like thunderclaps. Even with the thick cloth, even with his ears plugged with wax, even with\nthe shutters drawn tight and hung with a cloth, it was sometimes hard for him to sleep.\nThe muffling was dangerous. It left him vulnerable. And yet, lack of sleep would be even more\ndangerous. Perhaps the things he'd done to his body by burning tin would kill him. Yet, the more time he\nspent among the people of Urteau, the more he felt they were going to need his help to survive the\ndangers that were coming. He needed an edge. He worried that he'd made the wrong decision, but at"

He worried that he'd made the wrong decision, but at\nleast he'd made a decision. He would continue as he had, and hope that it was enough.\nHe groaned quietly, sitting up, taking off the cloth and pulling the wax from his ears. The room was\ndark, but even the faint light creeping through the shutters—their gaps stuffed with cloth—was enough for\nhim to see by.\nTin flared comfortably in his stomach. His reserve was nearly gone, burned away during the night. His\nbody now used it as instinctively as it drew breath or blinked. He had heard that Thugs could burn\npewter to heal their bodies even if they were unconscious from their wounds. The body understood what\nit needed.\nHe reached into a small pail beside his bed, pulling out a small handful of tin dust. He'd brought a lot\nwith him from Luthadel, and augmented this by buying more through the underground. Fortunately, tin\nwas relatively cheap. He dumped his handful into a mug on his nightstand, then moved to the door. The\nroom was small and cramped, but he didn't have to share it with anyone. That made it lavish by skaa\nstandards.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut, then pulled open the door. The luminosity of a sunlit hallway crashed\nagainst him. He gritted his teeth against the light, intense despite his shut eyelids, and felt about on the\nground. He found the jug of fresh water—drawn from the well for him by the inn's servants—and pulled\nit inside, then shut the door.\nHe blinked, walking across the room to fill his mug. He drank it, washing down the tin. It would be\nenough for the entire day. He took an extra handful and stuffed it into a pouch, just in case.\nA few minutes later he was dressed and ready. He sat down on the bed, closing his eyes, preparing\nfor the day. If the Citizen's spies were to be believed, other members of Elend's team were on their way\nto Urteau. They were probably under orders to secure the storage cache and quell the rebellion; Spook\nwould need to learn as much as he could before they arrived.\nHe sat, going over plans, thinking to himself. He could feel feet thumping in the rooms around him—the\nwooden structure seemed to shake and tremble like some enormous hive filled with bustling workers.\nOutside, he could hear voices calling, yelling, speaking. Bells rang faintly. It was early yet, barely past\nnoon, but the mists would be gone—Urteau got about six or seven hours of mistless daylight, making it a\nplace where crops could still grow and man could still thrive.\nNormally, Spook would have slept through the hours of daylight. However, there were things he\nneeded to do. He opened his eyes, then reached to his night-stand, picking up a pair of spectacles. They\nhad been specially crafted, at his request, to hold lenses that made no corrections to his vision. They\nwere just filled with regular glass.\nHe put these on, then retied the cloth around his head, covering the front and sides of the lenses. Even\nwith his heightened senses, he couldn't see through his own eyelids. However, with the spectacles on, he"

However, with the spectacles on, he\ncould open his eyes and wear the cloth at the same time. He felt his way to the window, then he pulled\noff the blanket and threw open the shutters.\nHot—nearly scalding—sunlight bathed him. The cloth bit into the skin of his head. But he could see.\nThe cloth blocked just enough light to keep him from being blinded, yet was translucent enough to allow\nvision. It was like the mists, actually—the cloth was nearly invisible to him, for his eyes were enhanced\nbeyond the point of reason. His mind just filtered out the cloth's interference.\nSpook nodded to himself, then picked up his dueling cane and made his way from the room.\n\"I know you're a quiet one,\" Durn said, rapping softly on the ground in front of him with a pair of sticks.\n\"But even you have to admit that this is better than living under the lords.\"\nSpook sat in a streetslot, back to the stone wall that had sustained the canal, head bowed slightly.\nMarketpit was the widest of the streetslots of Urteau. Once, it had been a waterway so broad that three\nboats abreast could moor in its center while leaving room on both sides for the passage of others in either\ndirection. Now it had become a central boulevard for the city, which also made it a prime location for\ntradesmen and beggars.\nBeggars like Spook and Durn. They sat at the very side of the slot, buildings looming like fortress walls\nabove. Few of the passers paid any attention to the ragged men. Nobody paused to notice that one of\nthem seemed to be watching the crowd carefully, despite the dark cloth over his eyes, while the other\nspoke far too articulately to have been educated in the gutter.\nSpook didn't respond to Durn's question. In his youth, the way he spoke—with a thick accent,\nlanguage littered with slang—had marked him, made people dismiss him. Even now, he didn't have a glib\ntongue or charming manner like Kelsier's. So, instead, Spook just tried to say as little as possible. Less\nchance of getting himself into trouble that way.\nOddly, instead of finding him easier to dismiss when he didn't talk, it seemed that people paid more\nattention to him. Durn continued to pound out his rhythm, like a street performer with no audience. It was\ntoo soft against the earthen floor for anyone to hear—unless one were Spook.\nDurn's rhythm was perfect. Any minstrel would have envied him.\n\"I mean, look at the market,\" Durn continued. \"Under the Lord Ruler, most skaa could never engage\nopenly in commerce. We have something beautiful here. Skaa ruling skaa. We're happy.\"\nSpook could see the market. It seemed to him that if the people were truly happy, they'd wear smiles,\nrather than downcast looks. They'd be shopping and browsing, rather than quickly picking out what they\nwanted, then moving on. Plus, if the city were the happy utopia it was supposed to be, there wouldn't be"

Plus, if the city were the happy utopia it was supposed to be, there wouldn't be\na need for the dozens of soldiers who watched the crowd. Spook shook his head. Everybody wore\nnearly the exact same clothing—colors and styles dictated by the Citizen's orders. Even begging was\nheavily regulated. Men would soon arrive to count Spook's offerings, tally how much he had earned, then\ntake the Citizen's cut.\n\"Look,\" Durn said, \"do you see anyone being beaten or killed on the street? Surely that's worth a few\nstrictures.\"\n\"The deaths happen in quiet alleys now,\" Spook said softly. \"At least the Lord Ruler killed us openly.\"\nDurn frowned, sitting back, thumping the ground with his sticks. It was a complex pattern. Spook\ncould feel the vibrations through the ground, and found them soothing. Did the people know the talent\nthey passed, quietly beating the ground they walked upon? Durn could have been a master musician.\nUnfortunately, under the Lord Ruler, skaa didn't play music. And under the Citizen . . . well, it generally\nwasn't good to draw attention to yourself, no matter what the method.\n\"There it is,\" Durn said suddenly. \"As promised.\"\nSpook glanced up. Through the mutters, the sounds, the flashes of color and the powerful scents of\nrefuse, people, and goods for sale, Spook saw a group of prisoners, being escorted by soldiers in\nbrown. Sometimes, the flood of sensation was almost overwhelming to him. However, as he'd once told\nVin, burning tin wasn't about what one could sense, but about what one could ignore. And he had\nlearned very well to focus on the senses he needed, shunting aside that which would distract.\nThe market goers made way for the group of soldiers and their prisoners. The people bowed their\nheads, watching solemnly.\n\"You still want to follow?\" Durn asked.\nSpook stood.\nDurn nodded, then stood and grabbed Spook by the shoulder. He knew that Spook could really\nsee—or, at least, Spook assumed that Durn was observant enough to have noticed that fact. They both\nmaintained the act, however. It was common among beggars to adopt a guise of being afflicted in an\nattempt to elicit more coins. Durn himself walked with a masterful false limp, and had his hair pulled out in\nsickly patches. Yet, Spook could smell soap on the man's skin and fine wine on his breath. He was a\nthief lord; there were few more powerful in the city. Yet, he was clever enough with his disguises that he\ncould walk about on the streets unnoticed.\nThey weren't the only ones following the soldiers and their prisoners. Skaa wearing the approved gray\ntrailed the group like ghosts—a quiet, shuffling mass in the falling ash. The soldiers walked to a ramp\nleading out of the streetslots, guiding the people into a wealthier section of the town, where some of the\ncanals had been filled in and cobbled.\nSoon, the dead spots began to appear. Charred scars—ruins that had once been homes. The smell of\nsmoke was almost overpowering to Spook, and he had to start breathing through his mouth. They didn't"

The smell of\nsmoke was almost overpowering to Spook, and he had to start breathing through his mouth. They didn't\nhave to walk very far before arriving at their destination. The Citizen himself was in attendance. He rode\nno horse—those had all been shipped to the farms, for only crass noblemen were too good to walk the\nground on their own feet. He did, however, wear red.\n\"What's that he's wearing?\" Spook whispered as Durn led him around the side of the crowd. The\nCitizen and his retinue stood on the steps of a particularly grand mansion, and the skaa were clustering\naround. Durn led Spook to a place where a group of toughs had muscled themselves an exclusive piece\nof the street with a good vantage of the Citizen. They nodded to Durn, letting him pass without comment.\n\"What do you mean?\" Durn asked. \"The Citizen is wearing what he always does—skaa trousers and a\nwork shirt.\"\n\"They're red,\" Spook whispered. \"That's not an approved color.\"\n\"As of this morning it is. Government officers can wear it. That way, they stand out, and people in\nneed can find them. Or, at least, that's the official explanation.\"\nSpook frowned. However, something else caught his attention.\nShe was there.\nIt was natural, of course—she accompanied her brother wherever he went. He was particularly\nworried for her safety, and seldom let her out of his sight. She wore the same look as always, eyes\nsorrowful within a frame of auburn hair.\n\"Sad group today,\" Durn said, and at first Spook thought he was referring to Beldre. However, Durn\nwas nodding toward the group of prisoners. They looked just like the rest of the people in the city—gray\nclothing, ash-stained faces, subservient postures. The Citizen, however, stepped forward to explain the\ndifferences.\n\"One of the first proclamations this government made,\" he announced, \"was one of solidarity. We are a\nskaa people. The 'noblemen' chosen by the Lord Ruler oppressed us for ten centuries. Urteau, we\ndecided, would become a place of freedom. A place like the Survivor himself prophesied would come.\"\n\"You've got the count?\" Durn whispered to Spook.\nSpook nodded. \"Ten,\" he said, counting the prisoners. \"The ones we expected. You're not earning\nyour coin, Durn.\"\n\"Watch.\"\n\"These,\" the Citizen said, bald scalp shining in the red sunlight as he pointed at the prisoners. \"These\ndidn't heed our warning. They knew, as all of you know, that any nobleman who stayed in this city would\nforfeit his life! This is our will—all of our will.\n\"But, like all of their kind, these were too arrogant to listen. They tried to hide. But, they think\nthemselves above us. They always will. That exposes them.\"\nHe paused, then spoke again. \"And that is why we do what we must.\"\nHe waved his soldiers forward.

Then, the soldiers barred the\ndoor from the outside and took up a perimeter. Each soldier lit a torch and threw it on the building. It\ndidn't take superhuman senses to feel the heat that soon blazed to life, and the crowd shied\nback—revolted and frightened, but fascinated.\nThe windows had been boarded shut. Spook could see fingers trying to pry the wood free, could hear\npeople screaming. He could hear them thumping against the locked door, trying to break their way out,\ncrying in terror.\nHe longed to do something. Yet, even with tin, he couldn't fight an entire squad of soldiers on his own.\nElend and Vin had sent him to gather information, not play their hand. Still, he cringed, calling himself a\ncoward as he turned away from the burning building.\n\"This should not be,\" Spook whispered harshly.\n\"They were noblemen,\" Durn said.\n\"No they weren't! Their parents might have been, but these were skaa. Normal people, Durn.\"\n\"They have noble blood.\"\n\"So do we all, if you look back far enough,\" Spook said.\nDurn shook his head. \"This is the way it has to be. This is the Survivor—\"\n\"Do not speak his name in association with this barbarity,\" Spook hissed.\nDurn was quiet for a moment, the only sounds that of the flames and those dying inside them. Finally,\nhe spoke. \"I know it's hard to see, and perhaps the Citizen is too eager. But . . . I heard him speak once.\nThe Survivor. This is the sort of thing he taught. Death to the noblemen; rule by the skaa. If you'd heard\nhim, you'd understand. Sometimes, you have to destroy something in order to build something better.\"\nSpook closed his eyes. Heat from the fire seemed to be searing his skin. He had heard Kelsier speak\nto crowds of skaa. And, Kelsier had said the things that Durn now referred to. Then, the Survivor had\nbeen a voice of hope, of spirit. His same words repeated now, however, became words of hatred and\ndestruction. Spook felt sick.\n\"Again, Durn,\" he said, looking up, feeling particularly harsh, \"I don't pay you to spout Citizen\npropaganda at me. Tell me why I'm here, or you'll get no further coin from me.\"\nThe large beggar turned, meeting Spook's eyes behind the cloth. \"Count the skulls,\" he said quietly.\nWith that, Durn took his hand off Spook's shoulder and retreated into the crowd.\nSpook didn't follow. The scents of smoke and burning flesh were growing too powerful for him. He\nturned, pushing his way through the crowd, seeking fresh air. He stumbled up against a building, breathing\ndeeply, feeling the rough grain of its wood press against his side. It seemed to him that the falling flakes of\nash were a part of the pyre behind, bits of death cast upon the wind.\nHe heard voices. Spook turned, noting that the Citizen and his guards had moved away from the fire.\nQuellion was addressing the crowd, encouraging them to be vigilant. Spook watched for a time, and"

Spook watched for a time, and\nfinally the crowd began to leave, trailing the Citizen as he moved back toward the market pit.\nHe's punished them, now he needs to bless them. Often, especially after executions, the Citizen\nvisited the people personally, moving between stalls in the market, shaking hands and giving\nencouragement.\nSpook took off down a side street. He soon passed out of the wealthier section of town, arriving at a\nplace where the street fell away before him. He chose a place where the retaining wall had collapsed,\nforming a slope down into the dry canal, then hopped down, skidding his way to the bottom. He pulled\nup the hood of his cloak, obscuring his covered eyes, and made his way through the busy street with the\ndexterity of one who had grown up a street urchin.\nEven taking a more roundabout route, he arrived at Marketpit before the Citizen and his retinue.\nSpook watched through the raining ash as the man moved down a broad ramp of earth, trailed by a\nfollowing that numbered in the hundreds.\nYou want to be him, Spook thought, crouching beside a merchant's stall. Kelsier died to bring this\npeople hope, and now you think to steal his legacy.\nThis man was no Kelsier. This man wasn't even worthy to utter the Survivor's name.\nThe Citizen moved about, maintaining a paternal air, speaking to the people of the market. He touched\nthem on the shoulders, shook hands, and smiled benevolently. \"The Survivor would be proud of you.\"\nSpook could hear his voice even over the noise of the crowd. \"The ash that falls is a sign from him—it\nrepresents the fall of the empire, the ashes of tyranny. From those ashes we will make a new nation! One\nruled by skaa.\"\nSpook edged forward, putting down the top of his hood and feeling before himself with his hands, as if\nhe were blind. He carried his dueling cane across his back, in a strap obscured by the folds of his baggy\ngray shirt. He was more than capable when it came to moving through crowds. While Vin had always\nworked hard to remain obscure and unseen, Spook had managed to achieve both things without ever\ntrying. In fact, he'd often tried the opposite. He'd dreamed of being a man like Kelsier—for even before\nhe'd met the Survivor, Spook had heard stories of the man. The greatest skaa thief of their time—a man\nbold enough to try to rob the Lord Ruler himself.\nAnd yet, try as he might, Spook had never been able to distinguish himself. It was just too easy to\nignore yet another ash-faced boy, especially if you couldn't understand his thick Eastern slang. It had\ntaken actually meeting Kelsier—seeing how he could move people by talking—to finally convince Spook\nto abandon his dialect. That was when Spook had begun to understand that there was a power in words.\nSpook subtly moved his way toward the front of the crowd watching the Citizen. He got jostled and\nshoved, but nobody cried out against him. A blind man who had gotten caught up in the press of people\nwas easy to ignore—and what was ignored could get where it wasn't supposed to. With some careful"

With some careful\npositioning, Spook soon placed himself at the front of the group, barely an arm's length from the Citizen.\nThe man smelled of smoke.\n\"I understand, good woman,\" the Citizen was saying as he held an elderly woman's hands. \"But your\ngrandson is needed where he is, working the fields. Without him and his kind, we would not be able to\neat! A nation ruled by skaa also has to be one worked by skaa.\"\n\"But . . . can't he come back, even for a bit?\" the woman asked.\n\"In time, good woman,\" the Citizen said. \"In time.\" His crimson uniform made him the only splash of\ncolor on the street, and Spook found himself staring. He tore his eyes away and continued to maneuver,\nfor the Citizen was not his goal.\nBeldre stood to the side, as usual. Always watching, but never interacting. The Citizen was so dynamic\nthat his sister was easily forgotten. Spook understood that feeling quite well. He let a soldier jostle him,\npushing him out of the Citizen's way. That jostle placed Spook right next to Beldre. She smelt just faintly\nof perfume.\nI thought that was supposed to be forbidden.\nWhat would Kelsier have done? He'd have attacked, perhaps, killing the Citizen. Or, he'd have moved\nagainst the man in another way. Kelsier wouldn't have let such terrible things happen—he'd have acted.\nPerhaps he would have tried to make an ally out of someone trusted by the Citizen?\nSpook felt his heart—always so much louder to him now—beat faster. The crowd began to move\nagain, and he let himself get shoved up against Beldre. The guards weren't watching—they were focused\non the Citizen, keeping him safe with so many random elements around.\n\"Your brother,\" Spook whispered in her ear, \"you approve of his murders?\"\nShe spun, and he noticed for the first time that her eyes were green. He stood in the crowd, letting it\nshove him away as she searched, trying to figure out who had spoken. The crowd, following her brother,\ncarried her from Spook.\nSpook waited, being jostled in the sea of elbows, for a short time. Then he began to maneuver again,\npushing through the people with subtle care until he was again beside Beldre.\n\"You think this is any different from what the Lord Ruler did?\" he whispered. \"I once saw him gather\nup random people and execute them in the Luthadel city square.\"\nShe spun again, finally identifying Spook among the moving crowd. He stood still, meeting her eyes\ndespite the blindfold. People moved between them, and she was carried away.\nHer mouth moved. Only someone with the enhanced senses of tin could have seen with enough detail\nto make out the words on her lips.\n\"Who are you?\"\nHe pushed his way through the crowd one more time. The Citizen was apparently planning to make a\nbig speech up ahead, capitalizing on the increasingly large crowd. People were bunching up around the\npodium that lay in the middle of the market; it was getting more difficult to move through them."

People were bunching up around the\npodium that lay in the middle of the market; it was getting more difficult to move through them.\nSpook reached her, but felt the crowd pulling him away again. So, he reached between a pair of\nbodies and grabbed her hand, pulling her wrist as he moved with the surgings of the crowd's motion. She\nspun, of course, but she didn't cry out. The crowd moved around them, and she turned to meet his\nblindfolded eyes through the throng.\n\"Who are you?\" Beldre asked again. Though he was close enough to have heard her had she spoken,\nno sound escaped her lips. She just mouthed the words. Behind her, on the podium, her brother began to\npreach.\n\"I'm the man who will kill your brother,\" Spook said softly.\nAgain, he had expected a reaction from her—a scream, perhaps. An accusation. His actions here had\nbeen impulsive, born from his frustration at not being able to help the people who were executed. If she\ndid scream, he realized, it could bring his death.\nYet she remained silent, flakes of ash falling between them.\n\"Others have said that same thing,\" she mouthed.\n\"Others were not me.\"\n\"And who are you?\" she asked a third time.\n\"The companion of a god. A man who can see whispers and feel screams.\"\n\"A man who thinks he knows better for this people than their own chosen ruler?\" she mouthed. \"There\nwill always be dissenters who balk at what must be done.\"\nHe still had her hand. He gripped it tightly, pulling her close. The crowd crowded the podium, leaving\nher and Spook at their rear, like shells left on a beach by the retreating waves.\n\"I knew the Survivor, Beldre,\" he whispered harshly. \"He named me, called me friend. What you've\ndone in this city would horrify him—and I'm not going to let your brother continue to pervert Kelsier's\nlegacy. Bring him warning, if you must. Tell Quellion that I'm coming for him.\"\nThe Citizen had stopped speaking. Spook glanced up, looking toward the lectern. Quellion stood\nupon it, looking out over his crowd of followers. Looking at Spook and Beldre, standing together at the\nback of the crowd. Spook hadn't realized how exposed they had become.\n\"You there!\" the Citizen cried. \"What are you doing with my sister!\"\nDamn! Spook thought, releasing the girl and dashing away. However, one major inconvenience of the\nstreetslots was their high, steep walls. There were very few ways to get out of the market, and those\nwere all being watched by members of Quellion's security forces. At the Citizen's shouted command,\nsoldiers began to dash forward from their posts, wearing leather and carrying steel.\nFine, Spook thought, charging the nearest group of soldiers. If he could get through them, he could\nreach a ramp up, perhaps disappear into the alleys between buildings above.\nSwords scraped from scabbards. Behind Spook, people cried out in shock. He reached into the\nragged tears of his cloak and whipped forth his dueling cane.\nAnd then, he was among them."

He reached into the\nragged tears of his cloak and whipped forth his dueling cane.\nAnd then, he was among them.\nSpook wasn't a warrior, not really. He'd trained with Ham, of course—Clubs had insisted that his\nnephew know how to defend himself. However, the crew's true warriors had always been their\nMistborn, Vin and Kelsier, with Ham—as a Pewterarm—providing brute force, if necessary.\nYet, Spook had spent a lot of time training, lately, and while doing so he had discovered something\ninteresting. He had something that Vin and Kelsier could never have had: a blurring array of sensory\nknowledge that his body could instinctively use. He could feel disturbances in the air, sense tremors in the\nfloor, and could know where people were simply by how close their heartbeats sounded.\nHe was no Mistborn, but he was still very dangerous. He felt a soft wind, and knew a sword was\nswinging for him. He ducked. He felt a footstep on the ground, and knew someone was attacking from\nthe side. He stepped away. It was almost like having atium.\nSweat flew from his brow as he spun, and he cracked his dueling cane into the back of one soldier's\nhead. The man fell—Spook's weapon was crafted of the finest hardwood. But, just to be certain, he\nbrought the butt of the weapon down on the fallen man's temple, knocking him out of the battle for good.\nHe heard someone grunt beside him—soft, yet telling. Spook whipped his weapon to the side and\nsmacked it against the attacking soldier's forearm. The bones broke, and the soldier cried out, dropping\nhis weapon. Spook rapped him on the head. Then, Spook spun, lifting his cane to block the third\nsoldier's strike.\nSteel met wood, and the steel won, Spook's weapon breaking. However, it stopped the sword strike\nlong enough for Spook to duck away and grab a fallen warrior's sword. It was different from the swords\nhe'd practiced with—the men of Urteau preferred long, thin blades. Still, Spook only had one soldier\nleft—if he could cut the man down, he'd be free.\nSpook's opponent seemed to realize that he had the advantage. If Spook ran, it would expose his\nback to attack. However, if Spook stayed, he'd soon be overwhelmed. The soldier circled warily, trying\nto stall for time.\nSo, Spook attacked. He raised his blade, trusting in his enhanced senses to compensate for the\ndifference in training. The soldier raised his weapon to parry as Spook swung.\nSpook's sword froze in the air.\nSpook stumbled, trying to force the weapon forward, but it was strangely held in place—as if he were\ntrying to push it through something solid, rather than air. It was as if . . .\nSomeone was Pushing against it. Allomancy. Spook glanced desperately around him, and immediately\nfound the source of the power. The person Pushing had to be directly opposite Spook, for Allomancers\ncould only Push away from themselves.\nQuellion, the Citizen, had joined his sister.

His own weapon clanged\nto the ground a short distance from him, its ringing loud in his ears.\nHe didn't have time to gather his breath; he could only push himself up to dodge the soldier's follow-up\nblow.

Then, Spook threw himself forward, getting inside the soldier's guard.\nHe ducked under the man's arm and dashed to the side, hoping to run past and leave the soldier\nconfused.\nSomething caught his foot.\nSpook spun. At first, he assumed that Quellion was Pulling on him somehow. Then, he saw that the\nsoldier on the ground—the first one he'd dropped—had grabbed his foot.\nI hit that man in the head twice! Spook thought with frustration. There's no way he's still\nconscious!\nThe hand squeezed his foot, yanking Spook backward with an inhuman strength. With strength like\nthat, the man had to be a Thug—a pewter burner, like Ham.\nSpook was in serious trouble.\nSpook kicked, managing to break free, then stumbled to his feet. But a Thug would have the power of\npewter—he'd be able to run faster, and farther, than Spook.\nTwo Allomancers, counting the Citizen himself, Spook thought. Somebody isn't as disdainful of\nnoble blood as he claims!\nThe two soldiers advanced on him. Yelling in frustration—hearing his own heart thump like a pounding\ndrum—Spook threw himself at the Thug and grappled the man, taking him by surprise. In that moment of\nconfusion, Spook spun him around, using the Thug's body like a shield to protect himself from the third\nsoldier.\nHe hadn't counted on the Citizen's brutal training. Quellion always spoke of sacrifice and necessity.\nApparently, this philosophy extended to his soldiers, for the man with the sword rammed his weapon\nstraight through his friend's back, piercing his heart and driving the weapon directly into Spook's chest. It\nwas a move only a man with the strength and precision of a Thug could have performed.\nThree Allomancers, Spook thought, dazed, as the soldier tried to pull his sword free from two\nbodies. The body of the dead man was a weight that finally snapped the blade.\nHow did I even survive this long? They must have been trying not to reveal their powers.\nTrying to remain hidden from the population. . . ."

His heightened\nsenses should have made the pain so powerful that—\nIt hit. Everything went black.\nThe subtlety displayed in the ash-eating microbes and enhanced plants shows that Rashek got\nbetter and better at using the power. It burned out in a matter of minutes—but to a god, minutes\ncan pass like hours. During that time, Rashek began as an ignorant child who shoved a planet too\nclose to the sun, grew into an adult who could create ashmounts to cool the air, then finally\nbecame a mature artisan who could develop plants and creatures for specific purposes.\nIt also shows his mind-set during his time with Preservation's power. Under its influence he was\nobviously in a protective mode. Instead of leveling the ashmounts and trying to push the planet\nback into place, he was reactive, working furiously to fix problems that he himself had caused.\n17\nELEND RODE AT THE FRONT OF HIS MEN, astride a brilliant white stallion that had been\nscrubbed clean of ash. He turned his mount, looking over the ranks of nervous soldiers. They waited in\nthe evening light, and Elend could see their terror. They had heard rumors, then had those rumors\nconfirmed by Elend the day before. Today, his army would become immunized to the mists.\nElend rode through their ranks, General Demoux riding a roan stallion beside him. Both horses were\nbig destriers, brought on the trip to impress more than for usefulness. Elend and the other officers would\nspend most of the trip riding in canal boats, rather than on horseback.\nHe didn't worry about the morality of his decision to expose his forces to the mists—at least, he didn't\nworry about it at that moment. Elend had learned something very important about himself: He was\nhonest. Perhaps too honest. If he was uncertain, it would show in his face. The soldiers would sense his\nhesitation. So he'd learned to confine his worries and concerns to times when he was only with those\nclosest to him. That meant Vin saw too much of his brooding. However, it left him free at other times to\nproject confidence.\nHe moved quickly, letting his horse's hooves beat a thunder for the men to hear. Occasionally, he\nheard captains call out for their men to be firm. Even so, Elend saw the anxiety in his soldiers' eyes. And\ncould he blame them? This day, the men would face an enemy that they could not fight, and could not\nresist. Within the hour, seven hundred of them would lay dead. About one in fifty. Not bad odds, on a\ngrand scale—but that meant little to a man standing and feeling the mist creep around him.\nThe men stood their ground. Elend was proud of them. He had given those who wished it the\nopportunity to return to Luthadel instead of facing the mists. He still needed troops in the capital, and he'd\nrather not march with men unwilling to go into the mists. Almost none had gone.

The vast majority had\ninstead lined up in full ranks without having to be ordered, wearing full battle gear, armor polished and\noiled, uniforms looking as clean as possible in the ash-stained wilderness. It seemed right to Elend for\nthem to be in their armor. It made them seem as if they were going to battle—and, in a way, they were.\nThey trusted him. They knew that the mists were advancing toward Luthadel, and understood the\nimportance of capturing the cities with storage caverns. They believed in Elend's ability to do something\nto save their families.\nTheir trust made him even more determined. He reined in his horse, turning the massive beast beside a\nrank of soldiers. He flared pewter, making his body stronger, giving more power to his lungs, then Rioted\nthe emotions of the men to make them braver.\n\"Be strong!\" he shouted.\nHeads turned toward him, and the clanking of armor hushed. His own voice was so loud in his ears\nthat he had to dampen his tin. \"These mists will strike down some of us. However, most of us will be\nuntouched—and most who fall will recover! Then, none of us need fear the mists again. We cannot\narrive at Fadrex City without having inoculated ourselves! If we did so, we would risk being attacked in\nthe morning, when we are hiding in our tents. Our enemies would force us out into the mists anyway, and\nwe would have to fight with a sixth of our men shaking on the ground from sickness!\"\nHe turned his horse, Demoux following behind, and moved along the ranks. \"I do not know why the\nmists kill. But I trust in the Survivor! He named himself Lord of the Mists. If some of us die, then it is his\nwill. Stay strong!\"\nHis reminders seemed to have some effect. The soldiers stood a little straighter, facing west, toward\nwhere the sun would soon set. Elend reined in again, sitting tall and letting himself be seen.\n\"They look strong, my lord,\" Demoux said quietly, moving his horse up beside Elend's. \"It was a good\nspeech.\"\nElend nodded.\n\"My lord . . .\" Demoux said, \"did you mean what you said about the Survivor?\"\n\"Of course I did.\"\n\"I'm sorry, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"I didn't mean to question your faith, it's just that . . . well, you\ndon't have to keep up the charade of belief, if you don't want to.\"\n\"I gave my word, Demoux,\" Elend said, frowning and glancing at the scarred general. \"I do what I\nsay.\"\n\"I believe you, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"You are an honorable man.\"\n\"But?\"\nDemoux paused. \"But . . . if you don't really believe in the Survivor, I don't think he would want you\nspeaking in his name.\"\nElend opened his mouth to reprimand Demoux for his lack of respect, but stopped himself. The man\nspoke with honesty, from his heart. That wasn't the kind of thing to punish.\nBesides, he might have had a point. \"I don't know what I believe, Demoux,\" Elend said, looking back"

Sazed's religions have been dead for centuries,\nand even he has stopped talking about them. It seems to me that leaves the Church of the Survivor as the\nonly real option.\"\n\"With all due respect, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"That's not a very strong profession of faith.\"\n\"I'm having trouble with faith lately, Demoux,\" Elend said, looking up, watching flakes of ash drift\nthrough the air. \"My last god was killed by the woman I eventually married—a woman you claim as a\nreligious figure, but who spurns your devotion.\"\nDemoux nodded quietly.\n\"I don't reject your god, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"I meant what I said—I think having faith in Kelsier is\nbetter than the alternatives. And, considering what's going to be coming at us in the next few months, I'd\nrather believe that something—anything—is out there helping us.\"\nThey were quiet for a few moments.\n\"I know that the Lady Heir objects to our worship of the Survivor, my lord,\" Demoux finally said. \"She\nknew him, as did I. What she doesn't understand is that the Survivor has become so much more than just\nthe man Kelsier.\"\nElend frowned. \"That sounds like you calculatedly made him a god, Demoux—that you believe in him\nas a symbol only.\"\nDemoux shook his head. \"I'm saying that Kelsier was a man, but a man who gained something—a\nmantle, a portion of something eternal and immortal. When he died, he wasn't just Kelsier, the\ncrewleader. Don't you think it odd that he was never Mistborn before he went to the Pits?\"\n\"That's the way Allomancy works, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"You don't gain your powers until you\nSnap—until you face something traumatic, something that nearly kills you.\"\n\"And you don't think that Kelsier experienced those kinds of events before the Pits?\" Demoux asked.\n\"My lord, he was a thief who robbed from obligators and noblemen. He lived a very dangerous life. You\nthink he could have avoided beatings, near-deaths, and emotional anguish?\"\nElend paused.\n\"He gained his powers at the Pits,\" Demoux said quietly, \"because something else came upon him.\nPeople who knew him speak of how he was a changed man when he came back. He had purpose—he\nwas driven to accomplish something the rest of the world thought impossible.\"\nDemoux shook his head. \"No, my lord. Kelsier the man died in those Pits, and Kelsier the Survivor\nwas born. He was granted great power, and great wisdom, by a force that is above us all. That is why\nhe accomplished what he did. That is why we worship him. He still had the follies of a man, but he had\nthe hopes of a divinity.\"\nElend turned away. The rational, scholarly side of him understood exactly what was happening.\nKelsier was gradually being deified, his life made more and more mystical by those who followed him."

The rational, scholarly side of him understood exactly what was happening.\nKelsier was gradually being deified, his life made more and more mystical by those who followed him.\nKelsier had to be invested with heavenly power, for the Church couldn't continue to revere a mere man.\nAnd yet, another part of Elend was glad for the rationalization, if only because it made the story that\nmuch more believable. After all, Demoux was right. How did a man living on the streets last so long\nbefore Snapping?\nSomeone screamed.\nElend looked up, scanning the ranks. Men began to shuffle as the mists appeared, sprouting in the air\nlike growing plants. He couldn't see the soldier who had fallen. Soon, the point was moot, for others\nbegan to scream.\nThe sun began to be obscured, blazing red as it approached the horizon. Elend's horse shuffled\nnervously. The captains ordered the men to remain steady, but Elend could still see motion. In the group\nbefore him, pockets appeared in the ranks as men randomly collapsed to the ground, like marionettes\nwhose strings had been cut. They shook on the ground, other soldiers backing away in horror, mist\nmoving all around.\nThey need me, Elend thought, grabbing his reigns, Pulling on the emotions of those around him.\n\"Demoux, let's ride.\"\nHe turned his horse. Demoux did not follow.\nElend spun. \"Demoux? What—\"\nHe choked off immediately. Demoux sat in the mists, shaking horribly. Even as Elend watched, the\nbalding soldier slipped from his saddle, collapsing to the ankle-deep ash below.\n\"Demoux!\" Elend yelled, hopping down, feeling like a fool. He'd never thought to wonder if Demoux\nwas susceptible—he'd just assumed that he, like Vin and the others, was already immune. Elend knelt\nbeside Demoux, his legs in the ash, listening to soldiers scream and captains yell for order. His friend\nshook and twisted, gasping in pain.\nAnd the ash continued to fall.\nRashek didn't solve all the world's problems. In fact, with each thing he did fix, he created new\nissues. However, he was clever enough that each subsequent problem was smaller than the ones\nbefore it. So, instead of plants that died from the distorted sun and ashy ground, we got plants\nthat didn't provide quite enough nutrition.\nHe did save the world. True, the near-destruction was his fault in the first place—but he did an\nadmirable job, all things considered. At least he didn't release Ruin to the world as we did.\n18\nSAZED SLAPPED HIS HORSE ON THE RUMP, sending it galloping away. The beast's hooves\nkicked up chunks of packed ash as it ran. Its coat had once been a keen white; now it was a rough gray.\nIts ribs were beginning to show—it was malnourished to the point that it was no longer reasonable to\nexpect it to carry a rider, and they could no longer afford to spare food for it.\n\"Now, that's a sad sight,\" Breeze noted, standing beside Sazed on the ash-covered road.

        "text": "\"Now, that's a sad sight,\" Breeze noted, standing beside Sazed on the ash-covered road. Their guard\nof two hundred soldiers waited quietly, watching the beast run. Sazed couldn't help feeling that the\nrelease of their final horse was a symbol.\n\"You think it will be able to survive?\" Breeze asked.\n\"I suspect that it will still be able to poke beneath the ash and find nourishment for a time,\" Sazed said.\n\"It will be difficult, however.\"\nBreeze grunted. \"Living's difficult work for all of us, these days. Well, I wish the creature the best of\nluck. Are you going to join Allrianne and me in the carriage?\"\nSazed glanced over his shoulder, toward the vehicle, which had been lightened, then rigged to be\npulled by soldiers. They had removed the doors and hung curtains instead, and had removed sections of\nthe back as well. With the decreased weight and two hundred men to take turns, the vehicle wouldn't be\ntoo much of a burden. Still, Sazed knew he would feel guilty being pulled by others. His old servant's\ninstincts were too strong.\n\"No,\" Sazed said. \"I shall walk for a bit. Thank you.\"\nBreeze nodded, walking to the carriage to sit with Allrianne, a soldier holding a parasol over his head\nuntil he was inside. Now exposed to the ash, Sazed put up the hood of his travel robe, hefted his\nportfolio in his arm, then strode across the black ground to the front of the line.\n\"Captain Goradel,\" he said. \"You may continue your march.\"\nThey did so. It was a rough hike—the ash was growing thick, and it was slick and tiring to walk on. It\nmoved and shifted beneath the feet, almost as difficult as walking on sand. As hard as the hike was,\nhowever, it wasn't enough to distract Sazed from his troubled feelings. He had hoped that visiting the\narmy—meeting with Elend and Vin—would give him a respite. The two were dear friends, and their\naffection for one another tended to bolster him. He had, after all, been the one to perform their marriage.\nYet, this meeting had left him even more troubled. Vin allowed Elend to die, he thought. And she did\nit because of things I taught her.\nHe carried the picture of a flower in his sleeve pocket, trying to make sense of his conversation with\nVin. How had Sazed become the one that people came to with their problems? Couldn't they sense that\nhe was simply a hypocrite, capable of formulating answers that sounded good, yet incapable of following\nhis own advice? He felt lost. He felt a weight, squeezing him, telling him to simply give up.\nHow easily Elend spoke of hope and humor, as if being happy were simply a decision one made.\nSome people assumed that it was. Once, Sazed might have agreed with them. Now, his stomach simply\ntwisted, and he felt sick at the thought of taking pretty much any action. His thoughts were constantly\ninvaded by doubts.\nThis is what religion is for, Sazed thought as he tromped through the ash at the head of the column,\ncarrying his pack on his shoulders. It helps people through times like these.\nHe looked down at his portfolio. Then, he opened it and leafed through the pages as he walked."

Then, he opened it and leafed through the pages as he walked.\nHundreds finished, and not a single one of the religions had provided the answers he sought. Perhaps he\nsimply knew them too well. Most of the crew had trouble worshipping Kelsier as the other skaa did, for\nthey knew of his faults and his quirks. They knew him as a man first, and as a god second. Perhaps the\nreligions were the same to Sazed. He knew them so well that he could see their flaws too easily.\nHe did not disparage the people who had followed the religions, but Sazed—so far—had found only\ncontradiction and hypocrisy in each religion he studied. Divinity was supposed to be perfect. Divinity\ndidn't let its followers get slaughtered, and certainly didn't allow the world to be destroyed by good men\nwho were just trying to save it.\nOne of the remaining ones would provide an answer. There had to be truth he could discover. As his\nfeelings of dark suffocation threatened to overwhelm him, he fell to his studies, taking out the next sheet in\nline and strapping it to the outside of the portfolio. He would study it as he walked, carrying the portfolio\nwith the sheet on the bottom when he wasn't reading, thereby keeping the ash off of it.\nHe'd find the answers. He dared not think what he would do if there weren't any.\nThey eventually passed into the Central Dominance, entering lands where men could still struggle for food\nand life. Breeze and Allrianne stayed in the carriage, but Sazed was glad to walk, even if it made his\nreligions difficult to study.\nHe wasn't certain what to make of the cultivated fields. They passed scores of them—Elend had\npacked as many people as possible into the Central Dominance, then had ordered all of them to grow\nfood for the coming winter. Even those skaa who had lived in the cities were well accustomed to hard\nwork, and they quickly did as Elend ordered. Sazed wasn't certain if the people understood just how dire\ntheir situation was, or if they were simply happy to have someone tell them what to do.\nThe roadside grew heaped with tall piles of ash. Each day, the skaa workers had to clear away the ash\nthat had fallen during the night. This unending task—along with the need to carry water to most of the\nnew, unirrigated fields—created a very labor-intensive system of agriculture.\nThe plants did grow, however. Sazed's troop passed field after field, each one budding with brown\nplants. The sight should have brought him hope. Yet, it was difficult to look upon the sprouting stalks and\nnot feel an even greater despair. They looked so weak and small beside the massive piles of ash. Even\nforgetting the mists, how was Elend going to feed an empire in these conditions? How long would it be\nbefore there was simply too much ash to move? Skaa worked the fields, their postures much as they had\nbeen during the days of the Lord Ruler. What had really changed for them?\n\"Look at them,\" a voice said. Sazed turned to see Captain Goradel walking up beside him. Bald and\nrugged, the man had a good-natured disposition—a trait common in the soldiers whom Ham promoted."

Bald and\nrugged, the man had a good-natured disposition—a trait common in the soldiers whom Ham promoted.\n\"I know,\" Sazed said quietly.\n\"Even with the ash and the mist, seeing them gives me hope.\"\nSazed looked up sharply. \"Really?\"\n\"Sure,\" Goradel said. \"My family were farmers, Master Terrisman. We lived in Luthadel, but worked\nthe outer fields.\"\n\"But, you were a soldier,\" Sazed said. \"Weren't you the one who led Lady Vin into the palace the night\nshe killed the Lord Ruler?\"\nGoradel nodded. \"Actually, I led Lord Elend into the palace to rescue Lady Vin, though she turned out\nto not need much help from us. Anyway, you're right. I was a soldier in the Lord Ruler's palace—my\nparents disowned me when I joined up. But, I just couldn't face working in the fields my whole life.\"\n\"It is arduous work.\"\n\"No, it wasn't that,\" Goradel said. \"It wasn't the labor, it was the . . . hopelessness. I couldn't stand to\nwork all day to grow something I knew would belong to someone else. That's why I left the fields to\nbecome a soldier, and that's why seeing these farms gives me hope.\"\nGoradel nodded toward a passing field. Some of the skaa looked up, then waved as they saw Elend's\nbanner. \"These people,\" Goradel said, \"they work because they want to.\"\n\"They work because if they don't, they will starve.\"\n\"Sure,\" Goradel said. \"I guess you're right. But they're not working because someone will beat them if\nthey don't—they're working so that their families and their friends won't die. There's a difference in that,\nto a farmer. You can see it in the way they stand.\"\nSazed frowned as they walked, but said nothing further.\n\"Anyway, Master Terrisman,\" Goradel said, \"I came to suggest that we make a stop at Luthadel for\nsupplies.\"\nSazed nodded. \"I suspected that we would do so. I, however, will need to leave you for a few days as\nyou go to Luthadel. Lord Breeze can take command. I shall meet up with you on the northern highway.\"\nGoradel nodded, moving back to make the arrangements. He didn't ask why Sazed wanted to leave\nthe group, or what his destination was.\nSeveral days later, Sazed arrived—alone—at the Pits of Hathsin. There was little to distinguish the area,\nnow that the ash covered everything. Sazed's feet kicked up clumps of it as he moved to the top of a hill.\nHe looked down on the valley that contained the Pits—the place where Kelsier's wife had been\nmurdered. The place where the Survivor had been born.\nIt was now the home of the Terris people.\nThere were few of them remaining. They had never been a very large population, and the coming of\nthe mists and the difficult trek down to the Central Dominance had claimed many lives. There were,\nperhaps, forty thousand of them left. And a good many of the men were eunuchs, like Sazed."

And a good many of the men were eunuchs, like Sazed.\nSazed moved down the slope toward the valley. It had been a natural place to settle the Terris people.\nDuring the days of the Lord Ruler, hundreds of slaves had worked here, watched over by hundreds more\nsoldiers. That had ended when Kelsier had returned to the Pits and destroyed their ability to produce\natium. However, the Pits still had the buildings and infrastructure that had supported them during their\nworking days. There was plenty of fresh water, and some shelter. The Terris people had improved on\nthis, building other structures across the valley, making what was once the most terrifying of prison camps\ninto a pastoral group of villages.\nEven as Sazed walked down the hillside, he could see people brushing away the ash from the ground,\nletting the natural plant life poke through to provide grazing for the animals. The scrub that formed the\ndominant foliage in the Central Dominance was a resilient, hardy group of plants, and they were adapted\nto ash, and didn't need as much water as farm crops. That meant that the Terris people actually had\neasier lives than most. They were herdsman, as they had been even during the centuries before the Lord\nRuler's Ascension. A hearty, short-legged breed of sheep mulled about on the hills, chewing down the\nuncovered stalks of scrub.\nThe Terris people, Sazed thought, living lives easier than most. What a strange world it has\nbecome.\nHis approach soon attracted attention. Children ran for their parents, and heads poked from shacks.\nSheep began to gather around Sazed as he walked, as if hoping that he had come bearing treats of some\nsort.\nSeveral aged men rushed up the hillside, moving as quickly as their gnarled limbs would allow.\nThey—like Sazed—still wore their steward's robes. And, like Sazed, they kept them cleaned of ash,\nshowing the colorful V-shaped patterns that ran down the fronts. Those patterns had once indicated the\nnoble house that the steward served.\n\"Lord Sazed!\" one of the men said eagerly.\n\"Your Majesty!\" said another.\nYour Majesty. \"Please,\" Sazed said, raising his hands. \"Do not call me that.\"\nThe two aged stewards glanced at each other. \"Please, Master Keeper. Let us get you something\nwarm to eat.\"\nYes, the ash was black. No, it should not have been. Most common ash has a dark component, but\nis just as much gray or white as it is black.\nAsh from the ashmounts . . . it was different. Like the mists themselves, the ash covering our\nland was not truly a natural thing. Perhaps it was the influence of Ruin's power—as black as\nPreservation was white. Or, perhaps it was simply the nature of the ashmounts, which were\ndesigned and created specifically to blast ash and smoke into the sky.\n19\n\"GET UP!\"\nEverything was dark.\n\"Get up!\"\nSpook opened his eyes.

He couldn't quite manage to think. He\nblinked, groaning quietly. What was wrong with him? His spectacles and cloth were gone. That should\nhave left him free to see, but everything was so dark.\nHe was out of tin.\nThere was nothing burning in his stomach. The familiar flame, a comforting candle within, was no\nlonger there. It had been his companion for over a year, always there. He'd feared what he was doing,\nbut had never let it die. And now it was gone.\nThat was why everything seemed so dull. Was this really how other people lived? How he used to\nlive? He could barely see—the sharp, rich detail he'd grown accustomed to was gone. The vibrant colors\nand crisp lines. Instead, everything was bland and vague.\nHis ears felt clogged. His nose . . . he couldn't smell the boards beneath him, couldn't tell the species of\nwood by scent. He couldn't smell the bodies that had passed. He couldn't feel the thumpings of people\nmoving about in other rooms.\nAnd . . . he was in a room. He shook his head, sitting up, trying to think. Immediately, a pain in his\nshoulder made him gasp. The wound had not been cared for. He remembered the sword piercing him\nnear the shoulder. That was not a wound one recovered from easily—indeed, his left arm didn't seem to\nwork right, one of the reasons he was having so much trouble rising.\n\"You've lost a lot of blood,\" the voice said. \"You'll die soon, even if the flames don't take you.

They're near.\"\nThere was a light nearby, down a hallway. Spook shook his head, trying to clear his mind. I'm in a\nhouse, he thought. A nice one. A nobleman's house.\nAnd they're burning it down.\nThis, finally, gave him motivation to stand, though he immediately dropped again, his body too\nweak—his mind too fuzzy—to keep him on his feet.\n\"Don't walk,\" the voice said. Where had he heard that voice before? He trusted it. \"Crawl,\" it said.\nSpook did as commanded, crawling forward.\n\"No, not toward the flames! You have to get out, so you can punish those who did this to you. Think,\nSpook!\"\n\"Window,\" Spook croaked, turning to the side, crawling toward one of them.\n\"Boarded shut,\" the voice said. \"You saw this before, from the outside. There's only one way to\nsurvive. You have to listen to me.\"\nSpook nodded dully.\n\"Go out the room's other door.

He'd been flaring tin so long that normal senses just didn't seem to work for him anymore. He\nfound the stairs, though he was coughing by the time he got there. That would be because of the smoke,\na part of his mind told him. It was probably a good thing he was crawling.\nHe could feel the heat as he climbed. The flames seemed to be chasing him, claiming the room behind\nhim as he moved up the stairs, still dizzy. He reached the top, then slipped on his own blood, slumping\nagainst the side of the wall, groaning.\n\"Get up!\" the voice said.\nWhere have I heard that voice before? he thought again. Why do I want to do what it says? It was\nso close. He'd have it, if his mind weren't so muddled. Yet, he obeyed, forcing himself to his hands and\nknees again.\n\"Second room on the left,\" the voice commanded.\nSpook crawled without thinking. Flames crept up the stairs, flickering across the walls. His nose was\nweak, like his other senses, but he suspected that the house had been soaked with oil. It made for a\nfaster, more dramatic burn that way.\n\"Stop. This is the room.\"\nSpook turned left, crawling into the room. It was a study, well furnished. The thieves in the city\ncomplained that ransacking places like this one wasn't worth the effort. The Citizen forbade ostentation,\nand so expensive furniture couldn't be sold, even on the black market. Nobody wanted to be caught\nowning luxuries, lest they end up burning to death in one of the Citizen's executions.\n\"Spook!\"\nSpook had heard of those executions. He'd never seen one. He'd paid Durn to keep an eye out for the\nnext one. Spook's coin would get him advance warning, as well as a good position to watch the building\nburn down. Plus, Durn promised he had another tidbit, something Spook would be interested in.\nSomething worth the coin he'd paid.\nCount the skulls.\n\"Spook!\"\nSpook opened his eyes. He'd fallen to the floor and begun to drift off. Flames were already burning\nthe ceiling. The building was dying. There was no way Spook would get out, not in his current condition.\n\"Go to the desk,\" the voice commanded.\n\"I'm dead,\" Spook whispered.\n\"No you're not. Go to the desk.\"\nSpook turned his head, looking at the flames. A figure stood in them, a dark silhouette. The walls\ndripped, bubbled, and hissed, their plaster and paints blackening. Yet, this shadow of a person didn't\nseem to mind the fire. That figure seemed familiar. Tall. Commanding.\n\"You . . .?\" Spook whispered.\n\"Go to the desk!\"\nSpook rolled to his knees. He crawled, dragging his useless arm, moving to the side of the desk.\n\"Right drawer.\"\nSpook pulled it open, then leaned against the side, slumping.

They were the kinds of vials used by Allomancers to store metal\nshavings. With trembling fingers, Spook picked one up, then it slipped free of his numb fingers. It\nshattered. He stared at the liquid that had been inside—an alcohol solution that would keep the metal\nflakes from corroding, as well as help the Allomancer drink them down.\n\"Spook!\" the voice said.\nDully, Spook took another vial. He worked off the stopper with his teeth, feeling the fires blaze around\nhim. The far wall was nearly gone. The fires crept toward him.\nHe drank the contents of the vial, then searched inside of himself, seeking tin. But there was none.\nSpook cried out in despair, dropping the vial. It had contained no tin. How would that have saved him\nanyway? It would have made him feel the flames, and his wound, more acutely.\n\"Spook!\" the voice commanded. \"Burn it!\"\n\"There is no tin!\" Spook yelled.\n\"Not tin! The man who owned this house was no Tineye!\"\nNot tin. Spook blinked. Then—reaching within himself—he found something completely unexpected.\nSomething he'd never thought to ever see, something that shouldn't have existed.\nA new metal reserve. He burned it.\nHis body flared with strength. His trembling arms became steady. His weakness seemed to flee, cast\naside like darkness before the rising sun. He felt tension and power, and his muscles grew taut with\nanticipation.\n\"Stand!\"\nHis head snapped up. He leaped to his feet, and this time the dizziness was gone. His mind still felt\nnumb, but something was clear to him. Only one metal could have changed his body, making it strong\nenough to work despite his terrible wound and blood loss.\nSpook was burning pewter.\nThe figure stood in the flames, dark, hard to make out. \"I've given you the blessing of pewter, Spook,\"\nthe voice said. \"Use it to escape this place. You can break through the boards on the far side of that\nhallway, escape out onto the roof of the building nearby. The soldiers won't be watching for you—they're\ntoo busy controlling the fire so it doesn't spread.\"\nSpook nodded. The heat didn't bother him anymore. \"Thank you.\"\nThe figure stepped forward, becoming more than just a silhouette. Flames played against the man's\nfirm face, and Spook's suspicions were confirmed. There was a reason he'd trusted that voice, a reason\nwhy he'd done what it had said.\nHe'd do whatever this man commanded.\n\"I didn't give you pewter just so you could live, Spook,\" Kelsier said, pointing. \"I gave it to you so you\ncould get revenge.

It all came down to\nRuin's subtle touch, and how much one responded to his promptings.\n20\nTENSOON SAT IN HIS CAGE.\nThe cage's very existence was an insult. Kandra were not like men—even if he were not imprisoned,\nTenSoon would not have run or tried to escape. He had come willingly to his fate.\nAnd yet, they locked him up. He wasn't certain where they had gotten the cage—it certainly wasn't\nsomething kandra normally would need. Still, the Seconds had found it and erected it in one of the main\ncaverns of the Homeland. It was made of iron plates and hard steel bars with a strong wire mesh\nstretched across all four faces to keep him from reducing his body to base muscles and wriggling through.\nIt was another insult.\nTenSoon sat inside, naked on the cold iron floor. Had he accomplished anything other than his own\ncondemnation? Had his words in the Trustwarren been of any value at all?\nOutside his cage, the caverns glowed with the light of cultivated mosses, and kandra went about their\nduties. Many stopped, studying him. This was the purpose of the long delay between his judgment and\nsentencing. The Second Generationers didn't need weeks to ponder what they were going to do to him.\nHowever, TenSoon had forced them to let him speak his mind, and the Seconds wanted to make certain\nhe was properly punished. They put him on display, like some human in the stocks. In all the history of\nthe kandra people, no other had ever been treated in such a way. His name would be a byword of shame\nfor centuries.\nBut we won't last centuries, he thought angrily. That was what my speech was all about.\nBut, he hadn't given it very well. How could he explain to the people what he felt? That their traditions\nwere coming to a focus, that their lives—which had been stable for so long—were in drastic need of\nchange?\nWhat happened above? Did Vin go to the Well of Ascension? What of Ruin, and Preservation?\nThe gods of the kandra people were at war again, and the only ones who knew of them were pretending\nthat nothing was happening.\nOutside his cage, the other kandra lived their lives. Some trained the members of the newer\ngenerations—he could see Elevenths moving along, little more than blobs with some glistening bones. The\ntransformation from mistwraith to kandra was a difficult one. Once given a Blessing, the mistwraith would\nlose most of its instincts as it gained sentience, and would have to relearn how to form muscles and\nbodies. It was a process that took many, many years.\nOther adult kandra went about food preparation. They would stew a mixture of algae and fungi inside\nstone pits, not unlike the one in which TenSoon would spend eternity. Despite his former hatred of\nmankind, TenSoon had always found the opportunity to enjoy outside food—particularly aged meat—a\nvery tempting consolation for going out on a Contract."

He sighed, looking through the bars at\nthe vast cavern. The caves of the Homeland were enormous, far too large for the kandra to fill. But, that\nwas what many of his people liked about them. After spending years in a Contract—serving a master's\nwhims, often for decades at a time—a place that offered the option of solitude was quite precious.\nSolitude, TenSoon thought. I'll have plenty of that, soon enough. Contemplating an eternity in\nprison made him a little less annoyed with the people who came to gawk at him. They would be the last\nof his people he ever saw. He recognized many of them. The Fourths and Fifths came to spit at the\nground before him, showing their devotion to the Seconds. The Sixths and the Sevenths—who made up\nthe bulk of the Contract fillers—came to pity him and shake their heads for a friend fallen. The Eighths\nand Ninths came out of curiosity, amazed that one so aged could have fallen so far.\nAnd then he saw a particularly familiar face amidst the watching groups. TenSoon turned aside,\nashamed, as MeLaan approached, pain showing in those overly large eyes of hers.\n\"TenSoon?\" a whisper soon came.\n\"Go away, MeLaan,\" he said quietly, his back to the bars, which only let him look out at another group\nof kandra, watching him from the other side.\n\"TenSoon . . .\" she repeated.\n\"You need not see me like this, MeLaan. Please go.\"\n\"They shouldn't be able to do this to you,\" she said, and he could hear the anger in her voice. \"You're\nnearly as old as they, and far more wise.\"\n\"They are the Second Generation,\" TenSoon said. \"They are chosen by those of the First. They lead\nus.\"\n\"They don't have to lead us.\"\n\"MeLaan!\" he said, finally turning toward her. Most of the gawkers stayed back, as if TenSoon's crime\nwere a disease they could catch. MeLaan crouched alone beside his cage, her True Body of spindly\nwooden bones making her look unnaturally slim.\n\"You could challenge them,\" MeLaan said quietly.\n\"What do you think we are?\" TenSoon asked. \"Humans, with their rebellions and upheavals? We are\nkandra. We are of Preservation. We follow order.\"\n\"You still bow before them?\" MeLaan hissed, pressing her thin face up against the bars. \"After what\nyou said—with what is happening above?\"\nTenSoon paused. \"Above?\"\n\"You were right, TenSoon,\" she said. \"Ash cloaks the land in a mantle of black. The mists come during\nthe day, killing both crops and people. Men march to war. Ruin has returned.\"\nTenSoon closed his eyes. \"They will do something,\" he finally said. \"The First Generation.\"\n\"They are old,\" MeLaan said. \"Old, forgetful, impotent.\"\nTenSoon opened his eyes. \"You have changed much.\"\nShe smiled. \"They should never have given children of a new generation to be raised by a Third.

You don't think that they know about you?\nThose of the Second Generation were not fools. They might be lazy, but they were old and\ncrafty—TenSoon understood this, for he knew each of them quite well. They would have kandra\nlistening, waiting to see what was said at his cage. A kandra of the Fourth or Fifth Generation who had\nthe Blessing of Awareness could stand a distance away, and still hear every word being spoken at his\ncage.\nTenSoon was kandra. He had returned to receive his punishment because that was right. It was more\nthan honor, more than Contract. It was who he was.\nAnd yet, if the things MeLaan had said were true . . .\nRuin has returned.\n\"How can you just sit here?\" MeLaan said. \"You're stronger than they are, TenSoon.\"\nTenSoon shook his head. \"I broke Contract, MeLaan.\"\n\"For a higher good.\"\nAt least I convinced her.\n\"Is it true, TenSoon?\" she asked very quietly.\n\"What?\"\n\"OreSeur.

But, it wasn't TenSoon's right. Nor, really, was it the right of the\nSecond Generation—or even the First Generation. It was the right of the one who had created them.\nThat one was dead. But, another had taken his place.\nMeLaan was silent for a time, still kneeling beside his cage. Perhaps she waited for him to offer\nencouragement, or perhaps to become the leader she sought. He didn't speak.\n\"So, you just came to die,\" she finally said.\n\"To explain what I've discovered. What I've felt.\"\n\"And then what? You come, proclaim dread news, then leave us to solve the problems on our own?\"\n\"That's not fair, MeLaan,\" he said. \"I came to be the best kandra I know how.\"\n\"Then fight!\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"It's true then,\" she said. \"The others of my generation, they said that you were broken by that last\nmaster of yours. The man Zane.\"\n\"He did not break me,\" TenSoon said.\n\"Oh?\" MeLaan said. \"And why did you return to the Homeland in that . . . body you were using?\"\n\"The dog's bones?\" TenSoon said. \"Those weren't given to me by Zane, but by Vin.\"\n\"So she broke you.\"\nTenSoon exhaled quietly.

On one hand, it seemed ironic to him that\nMeLaan—who intentionally wore a True Body that was inhuman—would find his use of a dog's body so\ndistasteful. Yet, he could understand. It had taken him quite some time to appreciate the advantages of\nthose bones.\nHe paused.\nBut, no. He had not come to bring revolution. He had come to explain, to serve the interests of his\npeople. He would do that by accepting his punishment, as a kandra should.\nAnd yet . . .\nThere was a chance. A slim one. He wasn't even certain he wanted to escape, but if there was an\nopportunity . . . \"Those bones I wore,\" TenSoon found himself saying. \"You know where they are?\"\nMeLaan frowned. \"No. Why would you want them?\"\nTenSoon shook his head. \"I don't,\" he said, choosing his words carefully. \"They were disgraceful! I\nwas made to wear them for over a year, forced into the humiliating role of a dog. I would have discarded\nthem, but I had no corpse to ingest and take, so I had to return here wearing that horrid body.\"\n\"You're avoiding the real issue, TenSoon.\"\n\"There is no real issue, MeLaan,\" he said, turning away from her. Whether or not his plan worked, he\ndidn't want the Seconds punishing her for associating with him. \"I will not rebel against my people.\nPlease, if you truly wish to help me, just let me be.\"\nMeLaan hissed quietly, and he heard her stand. \"You were once the greatest of us.\"\nTenSoon sighed as she left. No, MeLaan. I was never great. Up until recently, I was the most\northodox of my generation, a conservative distinguished only by his hatred of humans. Now, I've\nbecome the greatest criminal in the history of our people, but I did it mostly by accident.\nThat isn't greatness. That's just foolishness.\nIt should be no surprise that Elend became such a powerful Allomancer. It is a well-documented\nfact—though that documentation wasn't available to most—that Allomancers were much stronger\nduring the early days of the Final Empire.\nIn those days, an Allomancer didn't need duralumin to take control of a kandra or koloss. A\nsimple Push or Pull on the emotions was enough. In fact, this ability was one of the main reasons\nthat the kandra devised their Contracts with the humans—for, at that time, not only Mistborn, but\nSoothers and Rioters could take control of them at the merest of whims.\n21\nDEMOUX SURVIVED.\nHe was one of the larger group, the fifteen percent who grew sick, but did not die. Vin sat atop the\ncabin of her narrowboat, arm resting on a wooden ledge, idly fingering her mother's earring—which, as\nalways, she wore in her ear. Koloss brutes trudged along the towpath, dragging the barges and boats\ndown the canal. Many of the barges still carried supplies—tents, foodstuffs, pure water. Several had\nbeen emptied, however, their contents carried on the backs of the surviving soldiers, making room for the\nwounded."

Elend stood at the\nprow, as usual, staring west. He did not brood. He looked like a king, standing straight-backed, staring\ndeterminedly toward his goal. He looked so different now from the man he had once been, with his full\nbeard, his longer hair, his uniforms that had been scrubbed white. They were growing worn. Not ragged .\n. . they were still clean and sharp, as white as things could get in the current state of the world. They were\njust no longer new. They were the uniforms of a man who had been at war for two years straight.\nVin knew him well enough to sense that all was not well. However, she also knew him well enough to\nsense that he didn't want to talk about it for the moment.\nShe stood and stepped down, burning pewter unconsciously to heighten her balance. She slid a book\noff a bench beside the boat's edge, and settled down quietly. Elend would talk to her eventually—he\nalways did. For the moment, she had something else to engage her.\nShe opened the book to the marked page and reread a particular paragraph. The Deepness must be\ndestroyed, the words said. I have seen it, and I have felt it. This name we give it is too weak a\nword, I think. Yes, it is deep and unfathomable, but it is also terrible. Many do not realize that it is\nsentient, but I have sensed its mind, such as it is, the few times I have confronted it directly.\nShe eyed the page for a moment, sitting back on her bench. Beside her, the canal waters passed,\ncovered with a froth of floating ash.\nThe book was Alendi's logbook. It had been written a thousand years before by a man who had\nthought himself to be the Hero of Ages. Alendi hadn't completed his quest; he had been killed by one of\nhis servants—Rashek—who had then taken the power at the Well of Ascension and become the Lord\nRuler.\nAlendi's story was frighteningly close to Vin's own. She had also assumed herself to be the Hero of\nAges. She had traveled to the Well, and had been betrayed. She, however, hadn't been betrayed by one\nof her servants—but instead by the force imprisoned within the Well. That force was, she assumed,\nbehind the prophecies about the Hero of Ages in the first place.\nWhy do I keep coming back to this paragraph? she thought, eyeing it again. Perhaps it was because\nof what Human had said to her—that the mists hated her. She had felt that hatred herself, and it appeared\nthat Alendi had felt the same thing.\nBut, could she even trust the logbook's words? The force she had released, the thing she called Ruin,\nhad proven that it could change things in the world. Small things, yet important ones. Like the text of a\nbook, which was why Elend's officers were now instructed to send all messages via memorized words or\nletters etched into metal.\nRegardless, if there had been any clues to be gained by reading the logbook, Ruin would have"

She had thought she was having revelations and making great discoveries, but all she'd\nreally been doing was following Ruin's bidding.\nYet, Ruin is not omnipotent, Vin thought. If it were, there would have been no fight. It wouldn't\nhave needed to trick me into releasing it.\nIt cannot know my thoughts. . . .\nEven that knowledge was frustrating. What good were her thoughts? Always before, she'd had Sazed,\nElend, or TenSoon to talk with about problems like this. This wasn't a task for Vin; she was no scholar.\nYet, Sazed had turned his back on his studies, TenSoon had returned to his people, and Elend was far\ntoo busy lately to worry about anything but his army and its politics. That left Vin. And she still found\nreading and scholarship to be stuffy and boring.\nYet, she was also becoming more and more comfortable with the idea of doing what was necessary,\neven if she found it distasteful. She was no longer just her own person. She belonged to the New Empire.\nShe had been its knife—now it was time to try a different role.\nI have to do it, she thought, sitting in the red sunlight. There is a puzzle here—something to be\nsolved. What was it Kelsier liked to say?\nThere's always another secret.\nShe remembered Kelsier, standing boldly before a small group of thieves, proclaiming that they would\noverthrow the Lord Ruler and free the empire. We're thieves, he'd said. And we're extraordinarily\ngood ones. We can rob the unrobbable and fool the unfoolable. We know how to take an\nincredibly large task and break it down to manageable pieces, then deal with each of those pieces.\nThat day, when he'd written up the team's goals and plans on a small board, Vin had been amazed by\nhow possible he had made an impossible task seem. That day, a little bit of her had begun to believe that\nKelsier could overthrow the Final Empire.\nAll right, Vin thought. I'll begin like Kelsier did, by listing the things that I know for certain.\nThere had been a power at the Well of Ascension, so that much about the stories was true. There had\nalso been something alive, imprisoned in or near the Well. It had tricked Vin into using the power to\ndestroy its bonds. Maybe she could have used that power to destroy Ruin instead, but she'd given it up.\nShe sat thoughtfully, tapping her finger against the back of the logbook. She could still remember wisps\nof what it had felt like to hold that power. It had awed her, yet at the same time felt natural and right. In\nfact, while she held it, everything had felt natural. The workings of the world, the ways of men . . . it was\nlike the power had been more than simple capability. It had been understanding as well.\nThat was a tangent.

What did she know\nabout Ruin? She had touched it, felt it, in that moment she had released it. It had a need to destroy, yet it\nwas not a force of simple chaos. It didn't act randomly. It planned and thought. And, it didn't seem able\nto do anything it wanted. Almost as if it followed specific rules . . .\nShe paused. \"Elend?\" she called.\nThe emperor turned from his place beside the prow.\n\"What is the first rule of Allomancy?\" Vin asked. \"The first thing I taught you?\"\n\"Consequence,\" Elend said. \"Every action has consequences. When you Push on something heavy, it\nwill push you back. If you Push on something light, it will fly away.\"\nIt was the first lesson that Kelsier had taught Vin, as well as—she assumed—the first lesson his master\nhad taught him.\n\"It's a good rule,\" Elend said, turning back to his contemplation of the horizon. \"It works for all things\nin life. If you throw something into the air, it will come back down. If you bring an army into a man's\nkingdom, he will react . . .\"\nConsequence, she thought, frowning. Like things falling back when thrown into the sky. That's\nwhat Ruin's actions feel like to me. Consequences. Perhaps it was a remnant of touching the power,\nor perhaps just some rationalization her unconscious mind was giving her. Yet, she felt a logic to Ruin.\nShe didn't understand that logic, but she could recognize it.\nElend turned back toward her. \"That's why I like Allomancy, actually. Or, at least, the theory of it. The\nskaa whisper about it, call it mystical, but it's really quite rational. You can tell what an Allomantic Push is\ngoing to do as certainly as you can tell what will happen when you drop a rock off the side of the boat.\nFor every Push, there is a Pull. There are no exceptions. It makes simple, logical sense—unlike the ways\nof men, which are filled with flaws, irregularities, and double meanings. Allomancy is a thing of nature.\"\nA thing of nature.\nFor every Push, there is a Pull. A consequence.\n\"That's important,\" Vin whispered.\n\"What?\"\nA consequence.\nThe thing she had felt at the Well of Ascension had been a thing of destruction, like Alendi described in\nhis logbook. But, it hadn't been a creature, not like a person. It had been a force—a thinking force, but a\nforce nonetheless. And forces had rules. Allomancy, weather, even the pull of the ground. The world was\na place that made sense. A place of logic. Every Push had a Pull. Every force had a consequence.\nShe had to discover, then, the laws relating to the thing she was fighting.

He thinks that you're plotting against him, Reen whispered from the\nback of her mind. Fortunately, the days when she had listened to Reen's words were long past. Indeed,\nas she watched Elend, she saw him nod slowly, and accept her explanation. He turned back to his own\ncontemplations.\nVin rose, walking forward, laying a hand on his arm. He sighed, raising the arm and wrapping it around\nher shoulders, pulling her close. That arm, once the weak arm of a scholar, was now muscular and firm.\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Vin asked.\n\"You know,\" Elend said.\n\"It was necessary, Elend. The soldiers had to get exposed to the mists eventually.\"\n\"Yes,\" Elend said. \"But there's something more, Vin. I fear I'm becoming like him.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"The Lord Ruler.\"\nVin snorted quietly, pulling closer to him.\n\"This is something he would have done,\" Elend said. \"Sacrificing his own men for a tactical advantage.\"\n\"You explained this to Ham,\" Vin said. \"We can't afford to waste time.\"\n\"It's still ruthless,\" Elend said. \"The problem isn't that those men died, it's that I was so willing to make\nit happen. I feel . . . brutal, Vin. How far will I go to see my goals achieved? I'm marching on another\nman's kingdom to take it from him.\"\n\"For the greater good.\"\n\"That has been the excuse of tyrants throughout all time. I know it. Yet, I press on. This is why I didn't\nwant to be emperor. This is why I let Penrod take my throne from me back during the siege. I didn't want\nto be the kind of leader who had to do things like this. I want to protect, not besiege and kill! But, is\nthere any other way? Everything I do seems like it must be done. Like exposing my own men in the\nmists. Like marching on Fadrex City. We have to get to that storehouse—it's the only lead we have that\ncould even possibly give us some clue as to what we're supposed to do! It all makes such sense.\nRuthless, brutal sense.\"\nRuthlessness is the very most practical of emotions, Reen's voice whispered. She ignored it.\n\"You've been listening to Cett too much.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Elend said. \"Yet, his is a logic I find difficult to ignore. I grew up as an idealist, Vin—we\nboth know that's true. Cett provides a kind of balance. The things he says are much like what Tindwyl\nused to say.\"\nHe paused, shaking his head. \"Just a short time ago, I was talking with Cett about Allomantic\nSnapping.

A person's Allomantic powers were always latent until\nsomething traumatic brought them out. A person had to be brought to the brink of death and\nsurvive—only then would their powers be awakened. It was called Snapping.\nElend nodded. \"It was one of the great, dirty secrets of so-called noble life. Families often lost children\nto the beatings—those beatings had to be brutal for them to evoke Allomantic abilities. Each house was\ndifferent, but they generally specified an age before adolescence. When a boy or girl hit that age, they\nwere taken and beaten near to death.\"\nVin shivered slightly.\n\"I vividly remember mine,\" Elend said. \"Father didn't beat me himself, but he did watch. The saddest\nthing about the beatings was that most of them were pointless. Only a handful of children, even noble\nchildren, became Allomancers. I didn't. I was beaten for nothing.\"\n\"You stopped those beatings, Elend,\" Vin said softly. He had drafted a bill soon after becoming king.\nA person could choose to undergo a supervised beating when they came of age, but Elend had stopped\nit from happening to children.\n\"And I was wrong,\" Elend said softly.\nVin looked up.\n\"Allomancers are our most powerful resource, Vin,\" Elend said, looking out over the marching\nsoldiers. \"Cett lost his kingdom, nearly his life, because he couldn't marshal enough Allomancers to\nprotect him. And I made it illegal to search out Allomancers in my population.\"\n\"Elend, you stopped the beating of children.\"\n\"And if those beatings could save lives?\" Elend asked. \"Like exposing my soldiers could save lives?\nWhat about Kelsier? He only gained his powers as a Mistborn after he was trapped in the Pits of\nHathsin. What would have happened if he'd been beaten properly as a child? He would always have\nbeen Mistborn. He could have saved his wife.\"\n\"And then wouldn't have had the courage or motivation to overthrow the Final Empire.\"\n\"And is what we have any better?\" Elend asked. \"The longer I've held this throne, Vin, the more I've\ncome to realize that some of the things the Lord Ruler did weren't evil, but simply effective. Right or\nwrong, he maintained order in his kingdom.\"\nVin looked up, catching his eyes, forcing him to look down at her. \"I don't like this hardness in you,\nElend.\"\nHe looked out over the blackened canal waters. \"It doesn't control me, Vin. I don't agree with most of\nthe things the Lord Ruler did. I'm just coming to understand him—and that understanding worries me.\"\nShe saw questions in his eyes, but also strengths. He looked down and met her eyes. \"I can hold this\nthrone only because I know that at one point, I was willing to give it up in the name of what was right. If I\never lose that, Vin, you need to tell me. All right?\"\nVin nodded.\nElend looked back at the horizon again. What is it he hopes to see?

The balance between whom we\nwish to be and whom we need to be.\" He sighed. \"But for now,\" he said, nodding to the side, \"we simply\nhave to be satisfied with who we are.\"\nVin glanced to the side as a small courier skiff from one of the other narrowboats pulled up alongside\ntheirs. A man in simple brown robes stood upon it. He wore large spectacles, as if attempting to obscure\nthe intricate Ministry tattoos around his eyes, and he was smiling happily.\nVin smiled herself. Once, she had thought that a happy obligator was always a bad sign. That was\nbefore she'd known Noorden. Even during the days of the Lord Ruler, the contented scholar had\nprobably lived most of his life in his own little world. He provided a strange proof that even in the\nconfines of what had once been—in her opinion—the most evil organization in the empire, one could find\ngood men.\n\"Your Excellency,\" Noorden said, stepping off of the skiff and bowing. A couple of assistant scribes\njoined him on the deck, lugging books and ledgers.\n\"Noorden,\" Elend said, joining the man on the foredeck. Vin followed. \"You have done the counts I\nasked?\"\n\"Yes, Your Excellency,\" Noorden said as an aide opened up a ledger on a pile of boxes. \"I must say,\nthis was a difficult task, what with the army moving about and the like.\"\n\"I'm certain you were thorough as always, Noorden,\" Elend said. He glanced at the ledger, which\nseemed to make sense to him, though all Vin saw was a bunch of random numbers.\n\"What's it say?\" she asked.\n\"It lists the number of sick and dead,\" Elend said. \"Of our thirty-eight thousand, nearly six thousand\nwere taken by the sickness. We lost about five hundred and fifty.\"\n\"Including one of my own scribes,\" Noorden said, shaking his head.\nVin frowned. Not at the death, at something else, something itching at her mind . . .\n\"Fewer dead than expected,\" Elend said, pulling thoughtfully at his beard.\n\"Yes, Your Excellency,\" Noorden said. \"I guess these soldier types are more rugged than the average\nskaa population. The sickness, whatever it is, didn't strike them as hard.\"\n\"How do you know?\" Vin asked, looking up. \"How do you know how many should have died?\"\n\"Previous experience, my lady,\" Noorden said in his chatty way. \"We've been tracking these deaths\nwith some interest. Since the disease is new, we're trying to determine exactly what causes it. Perhaps\nthat will lead us to a way to treat it. I've had my scribes reading what we can, trying to find clues of other\ndiseases like this. It seems a little like the shakewelts, though that's usually brought on by—\"\n\"Noorden,\" Vin said, frowning. \"You have figures then?

He seemed interested.\n\"What is this about, Vin?\" he asked as Noorden and his men worked.\n\"I'm . . . not sure,\" Vin said.\n\"Numbers are important for generalizations,\" Elend said. \"But I don't see how . . .\" He trailed off as\nNoorden looked up from his calculations, then cocked his head, saying something softly to himself.\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\n\"I'm sorry, my lady,\" Noorden said. \"I was just a bit surprised. The calculation came out to be\nexact—precisely sixteen percent of the soldiers fell sick. To the man.\"\n\"A coincidence, Noorden,\" Elend said. \"It isn't that remarkable for calculations to come out exact.\"\nAsh blew across the deck. \"No,\" Noorden said, \"no, you are right, Your Excellency. A simple\ncoincidence.\"\n\"Check your ledgers,\" Vin said. \"Find percentages based on other groups of people who have caught\nthis disease.\"\n\"Vin,\" Elend said, \"I'm no statistician, but I have worked with numbers in my research. Sometimes,\nnatural phenomena produce seemingly odd results, but the chaos of statistics actually results in\nnormalization. It might appear strange that our numbers broke down to an exact percentage, but that's\njust the way that statistics work.\"\n\"Sixteen,\" Noorden said. He looked up. \"Another exact percentage.\"\nElend frowned, stepping over to the ledger.\n\"This third one here isn't exact,\" Noorden said, \"but that's only because the base number isn't a\nmultiple of twenty-five. A fraction of a person can't really become sick, after all. Yet, the sickness in this\npopulation here is within a single person of being exactly sixteen percent.\"\nElend knelt down, heedless of the ash that had dusted the deck since it had last been swept. Vin\nlooked over his shoulder, scanning the numbers.\n\"It doesn't matter how old the average member of the population is,\" Noorden said, scribbling. \"Nor\ndoes it matter where they live. Each one shows the exact same percentage of people falling sick.\"\n\"How could we have not noticed this before?\" Elend asked."

But, the total number who fall sick is always sixteen\npercent! We've been paying so much attention to how many died, we didn't notice how unnatural the\npercentages of those stricken were.\"\nElend stood. \"Check on this, Noorden,\" he said, gesturing toward the ledger. \"Do interviews, make\ncertain the data hasn't been changed by Ruin, and find out if this trend holds. We can't jump to\nconclusions with only four or five examples. It could all just be a large coincidence.\"\n\"Yes, Your Excellency,\" Noorden said, looking a bit shaken. \"But . . . what if it's not a coincidence?\nWhat does it mean?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Elend said.\nIt means consequence, Vin thought. It means that there are laws, even if we don't understand\nthem.\nSixteen. Why sixteen percent?\nThe beads of metal found at the Well—beads that made men into Mistborn—were the reason why\nAllomancers used to be more powerful. Those first Mistborn were as Elend Venture became—\npossessing a primal power, which was then passed down through the lines of the nobility,\nweakening a bit with each generation.\nThe Lord Ruler was one of these ancient Allomancers, his power pure and unadulterated by\ntime and breeding. That is part of why he was so mighty compared to other Mistborn—though,\nadmittedly, his ability to mix Feruchemy and Allomancy was what produced many of his most\nspectacular abilities. Still, it is interesting to me that one of his \"divine\" powers—his essential\nAllomantic strength—was something every one of the original nine Allomancers possessed.\n22\nSAZED SAT IN ONE OF THE NICER BUILDINGS at the Pits of Hathsin—a former\nguardhouse—holding a mug of hot tea. The Terris elders sat in chairs before him, a small stove providing\nwarmth.

The mists had already come, and they hung just outside the glass window.\nSazed could just barely make out depressions in the dark ground outside—cracks, in the earth. There\nwere dozens of the cracks; the Terris people had built fences to mark them. Only a few years ago,\nbefore Kelsier had destroyed the atium crystals, men had been forced to crawl down into those cracks,\nseeking small geodes which had beads of atium at their centers.\nEach slave who hadn't been able to find at least one geode a week had been executed. There were\nlikely still hundreds, perhaps thousands, of corpses pinned beneath the ground, lost in deep caverns,\ndead without anyone knowing or caring.\nWhat a terrible place this was, Sazed thought, turning away from the window as a young\nTerriswoman closed the shutters. Before him on the table were several ledgers which showed the\nresources, expenditures, and needs of the Terris people.\n\"I believe I suggested keeping these figures in metal,\" Sazed said.\n\"Yes, Master Keeper,\" said one of the elderly stewards. \"We copy the important figures into a sheet\nof metal each evening, then check them weekly against the ledgers to make certain nothing has changed.\"\n\"That is well,\" Sazed said, picking through one of the ledgers, sitting in his lap. \"And sanitation? Have\nyou addressed those issues since my last visit?\"\n\"Yes, Master Keeper,\" said another man. \"We have prepared many more latrines, as you\ncommanded—though we do not need them.\"\n\"There may be refugees,\" Sazed said. \"I wish for you to be able to care for a larger population, should\nit become necessary. But, please. These are only suggestions, not commands. I claim no authority over\nyou.\"\nThe group of stewards shared glances. Sazed had been busy during his time with them, which had\nkept him from dwelling on his melancholy thoughts. He'd made sure they had enough supplies, that they\nkept a good communication with Penrod in Luthadel, and that they had a system in place for settling\ndisputes among themselves.\n\"Master Keeper,\" one of the elders finally said. \"How long will you be staying?\"\n\"I must leave in the morning, I fear,\" Sazed said. \"I came simply to check on your needs. This is a\ndifficult time to live, and you could be easily forgotten by those in Luthadel, I think.\"\n\"We are well, Master Keeper,\" said one of the others. He was the youngest of the elders, and he was\nonly a few years younger than Sazed. Most of the men here were far older—and far wiser—than he.\nThat they should look to him seemed wrong.\n\"Will you not reconsider your place with us, Master Keeper?\" asked another. \"We want not for food\nor for land. Yet, what we do lack is a leader.\"\n\"The Terris people were oppressed long enough, I think,\" Sazed said. \"You have no need for another\ntyrant king.\"\n\"Not a tyrant,\" one said. \"One of our own.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler was one of our own,\" Sazed said quietly,\nThe group of men looked down.

Terrismen weren't killed by the\ndaymists.\nWhat was the connection?\nHe tried to summon the mental energy to think on the issue, but he felt traitorously apathetic.

He was a dirty, ragged thing—like most other skaa children in the Final Empire.\nToo young to be put to work in the mines, he spent his days ducking away from his mother's care and\nrunning about with the packs of children who foraged in the dry, dusty streets.\nSpook hadn't been that boy for some ten years. In a way, he was aware that he was delusional—that\nthe fever of his wounds was causing him to come in and out of consciousness, dreams of the past filling\nhis mind. He let them run. Staying focused required too much energy.\nAnd so, he remembered what it felt like as he hit the ground. A large man—all men were large\ncompared with Spook—stood over him, skin dirtied with the dust and grime of a miner.

One was\ncrying, the tears leaving lines of cleanliness on her cheeks, washing away the dust.\n\"All right,\" the large man said. \"We have him. Now what?\"\nThe people glanced at each other. One quietly closed the shack's door, shutting out the red sunlight.\n\"There's only one thing to be done,\" another man said. \"We turn him in.\"\nSpook looked up. He met the eyes of the crying woman. She looked away. \"Wasing the where of\nwhat?\" Spook demanded.\nThe large man spat again, setting a boot against Spook's neck, pushing him back down against the\nrough wood. \"You shouldn't have let him run around with those street gangs, Margel.

He was able to gasp for breath, his vision returning. And\nthere, spilled on the ground before him, was a scattering of beautiful copper coins. Skaa weren't paid for\ntheir work—the miners were given goods instead, barely enough to survive on. Yet, Spook had seen\ncoins occasionally passing between noble hands. He'd once known a boy who had found a coin, lost in\nthe dusty grime of the street.\nA larger boy had killed him for it. Then, a nobleman had killed that boy when he'd tried to spend it. It\nseemed to Spook that no skaa would want coins—they were far too valuable, and far too dangerous.\nAnd yet, every eye in the room stared at that spilled bag of wealth.\n\"The bag in exchange for the boy,\" a voice said. Bodies parted to where a man sat at a table at the\nback of the room. He wasn't looking at Spook. He just sat, quietly spooning gruel into his mouth. His\nface was gnarled and twisted, like leather that had been sitting in the sun for far too long. \"Well?\" the\ngnarled man said between bites.\n\"Where did you get money like this?\" Spook's father demanded.\n\"None of your business.\"\n\"We can't let the boy go,\" one of the skaa said. \"He'll betray us!

Surely taking his money is better than simply killing the boy.\"\nSpook's father looked down at the woman. \"You did this! You sent for your brother. You knew he'd\nwant to take the boy!\"\nSpook's mother turned away.\nThe gnarled man finally set down his spoon, then stood. People backed away from his chair in\napprehension. He walked with a pronounced limp as he crossed the room.\n\"Come on, boy,\" he said, not looking at Spook as he opened the door.\nSpook rose slowly, tentatively. He glanced at his mother and father as he backed away. Jedal stooped\ndown, finally gathering up the coins. Margel met Spook's eyes, then turned away. This is all I can give\nyou, her posture seemed to say.\nSpook turned, rubbing his neck, and rushed into the hot red sunlight after the stranger. The older man\nhobbled along, walking with a cane. He glanced at Spook as he walked.\n\"You have a name, boy?\"\nSpook opened his mouth, then stopped. His old name didn't seem like it would do any more.\n\"Lestibournes,\" he finally said.\nThe old man didn't bat an eye. Later, Kelsier would decide that Lestibournes was too difficult to say,\nand name him \"Spook\" instead. Spook never did figure out whether or not Clubs knew how to speak\nEastern street slang. Even if he did, Spook doubted that he'd understand the reference.\nLestibournes. Lefting I'm born.\nStreet slang for \"I've been abandoned.\"\nI now believe that Kelsier's stories, legends, and prophecies about the \"Eleventh Metal\" were\nfabricated by Ruin. Kelsier was looking for a way to kill the Lord Ruler, and Ruin—ever\nsubtle—provided a way.\nThat secret was indeed crucial. Kelsier's Eleventh Metal provided the very clue we needed to\ndefeat the Lord Ruler. However, even in this, we were manipulated. The Lord Ruler knew Ruin's\ngoals, and would never have released him from the Well of Ascension. So, Ruin needed other\npawns—and for that to happen, the Lord Ruler needed to die. Even our greatest victory was\nshaped by Ruin's subtle fingers.\n24\nDAYS LATER, MELAAN'S WORDS still pricked TenSoon's conscience.\nYou come, proclaim dread news, then leave us to solve the problems on our own? During his\nyear of imprisonment, it had seemed simple. He would make his accusations, deliver his information, then\naccept the punishment he deserved."

He would make his accusations, deliver his information, then\naccept the punishment he deserved.\nBut now, strangely, an eternity of imprisonment seemed like the easy way out. If he let himself be\ntaken in such a manner, how was he better than the First Generation? He would be avoiding the issues,\ncontent to be locked away, knowing that the outside world was no longer his problem.\nFool, he thought. You'll be imprisoned for eternity—or, at least, until the kandra themselves are\ndestroyed, and you die of starvation. That's not the easy way out! By accepting your punishment,\nyou're doing the honorable, orderly thing.\nAnd by so doing, he would leave MeLaan and the others to be destroyed as their leaders refused to\ntake action. What's more, he would leave Vin without the information she needed. Even from within the\nHomeland, he could feel the occasional rumbles in the rock. The earthquakes were still remote, and the\nothers likely ignored them. But TenSoon worried.\nThe end could be nearing. If it was, then Vin needed to know the truths about the kandra. Their\norigins, their beliefs. Perhaps she could use the Trust itself. Yet, if he told Vin anything more, it would\nmean an even greater betrayal of his people. Perhaps a human would have found it ridiculous that he\nwould hesitate now. However, so far, his true sins had been impulsive, and he'd only later rationalized\nwhat he'd done. If he fought his way free of prison, it would be different. Willful and deliberate.\nHe closed his eyes, feeling the chill of his cage, which still sat alone in the large cavern—the place was\nmostly abandoned during the sleeping hours. What was the point? Even with the Blessing of\nPresence—which let TenSoon focus, despite his uncomfortable confines—he could think of no way to\nescape the meshed cage and its Fifth Generation guards, who all bore the Blessing of Potency. Even if he\ndid get out of the cage, TenSoon would have to pass through dozens of small caverns. With his body\nmass as low as it was, he didn't have the muscles to fight, and he couldn't outrun kandra who had the\nBlessing of Potency. He was trapped.\nIn a way, this was comforting. Escape was not something he preferred to contemplate—it simply\nwasn't the kandra way. He had broken Contract, and deserved punishment. There was honor in facing\nthe consequences of one's actions.\nWasn't there?\nHe shifted positions in his cell. Unlike that of a real human, the skin of his naked body did not become\nsore or chapped from the extended exposure, for he could re-form his flesh to remove wounds.\nHowever, there was little to do about the cramped feeling he got from being forced to sit in the small\ncage for so long.\nMotion caught his attention. TenSoon turned, surprised to see VarSell and several other large Fifths\napproaching his cage, their quartzite stone True Bodies ominous in size and coloring.\nTime already? TenSoon thought. With the Blessing of Presence, he was able to mentally recount the\ndays of his imprisonment. It was nowhere near time. He frowned, noting that one of the Fifths carried a"

        "text": "Time already? TenSoon thought. With the Blessing of Presence, he was able to mentally recount the\ndays of his imprisonment. It was nowhere near time. He frowned, noting that one of the Fifths carried a\nlarge sack. For a moment, Ten-Soon had a flash of panic as he pictured them towing him away inside the\nsack.\nIt looked filled already, however.\nDared he hope? Days had passed since his conversation with MeLaan, and while she had returned\nseveral times to look at him, they had not spoken. He'd almost forgotten his words to her, said in the\nhope that they would be overheard by the minions of the Second Generation. VarSell opened the cage\nand tossed the sack in. It clinked with a familiar sound. Bones.\n\"You are to wear those to the trial,\" VarSell said, leaning down and putting a translucent face up next\nto TenSoon's bars. \"Orders of the Second Generation.\"\n\"What is wrong with the bones I now wear?\" TenSoon asked carefully, pulling over the sack, uncertain\nwhether to be excited or ashamed.\n\"They intend to break your bones as part of your punishment,\" VarSell said, smiling. \"Something like a\npublic execution—but where the prisoner lives through the process. It's a simple thing, I know—but the\ndisplay ought to leave . . . an impression on some of the younger generations.\"\nTenSoon's stomach twisted. Kandra could re-form their bodies, true, but they felt pain just as acutely\nas any human. It would take quite a severe beating to break his bones, and with the Blessing of Presence,\nthere would be no release of unconsciousness for him.\n\"I still don't see the need for another body,\" TenSoon said, pulling out one of the bones.\n\"No need to waste a perfectly good set of human bones, Third,\" VarSell said, slamming the cage door\nclosed. \"I'll be back for your current bones in a few hours.\"\nThe leg bone he pulled out was not that of a human, but a dog. A large wolfhound. It was the very\nbody TenSoon had been wearing when he'd returned to the Homeland over a year before. He closed his\neyes, holding the smooth bone in his fingers.\nA week ago, he'd spoken of how much he despised these bones, hoping that the Second Generation's\nspies would carry the news back to their masters. The Second Generation was far more traditional than\nMeLaan, and even she had found the thought of wearing a dog's body distasteful. To the Seconds,\nforcing TenSoon to wear an animal's body would be supremely degrading.\nThat was exactly what TenSoon had been counting on.\n\"You'll look good, wearing that,\" VarSell said, standing to leave. \"When your punishment comes,\neveryone will be able to see you for what you really are. No kandra would break his Contract.\"\nTenSoon rubbed the thighbone with a reverent finger, listening to VarSell's laughter. The Fifth had no\nway of knowing that he'd just given TenSoon the means he needed to escape.\nThe Balance. Is it real?\nWe've almost forgotten this little bit of lore. Skaa used to talk about it, before the Collapse.\nPhilosophers discussed it a great deal in the third and fourth centuries, but by Kelsier's time, it\nwas mostly a forgotten topic."

        "text": "Philosophers discussed it a great deal in the third and fourth centuries, but by Kelsier's time, it\nwas mostly a forgotten topic.\nBut it was real. There was a physiological difference between skaa and nobility. When the Lord\nRuler altered mankind to make them more capable of dealing with ash, he changed other things\nas well. Some groups of people—the noblemen—were created to be less fertile, but taller,\nstronger, and more intelligent. Others—the skaa—were made to be shorter, hardier, and to have\nmany children.\nThe changes were slight, however, and after a thousand years of interbreeding, the differences\nhad largely been erased.\n25\n\"FADREX CITY,\" ELEND SAID, standing in his customary place near the narrowboat's prow.\nAhead, the broad Conway Canal—the primary canal route to the west—continued into the distance,\nturning to the northwest. To Elend's left, the ground rose in a broken incline, forming a set of steep rock\nformations. He could see them rising much higher in the distance.\nCloser to the canal, however, a broad city was nestled in the very center of a large group of rock\nformations. The deep red and orange rocks were the type left behind when wind and rain wore away\nweaker sections of stone, and many of them reached high, like spires. Others formed jagged, hedge-like\nbarriers—like stacks of enormous blocks that had been fused together, reaching some thirty and forty\nfeet into the air.\nElend could barely see the tips of the city's buildings over the stone formations. Fadrex had no formal\ncity wall, of course—only Luthadel had been allowed one of those—but the rising rocks around the city\nformed a set of terrace-like natural fortifications.\nElend had been to the city before. His father had made certain to introduce him in all of the Final\nEmpire's main cultural centers. Fadrex hadn't been one of those, but it had been on the way to\nTremredare, once known as the capital of the West. In forging his new kingdom, however, Cett had\nignored Tremredare, instead establishing his capital in Fadrex. A clever move, in Elend's\nestimation—Fadrex was smaller, more defensible, and had been a major supply station for numerous\ncanal routes.\n\"The city looks different from the last time I was here,\" Elend said.\n\"Trees,\" Ham said, standing beside him. \"Fadrex used to have trees growing on the rocky shelves and\nplateaus.\" Ham glanced at him. \"They're ready for us. They cut down the trees to provide a better killing\nfield and to keep us from sneaking up close.\"\nElend nodded. \"Look down there.\"\nHam squinted, though it obviously took him a moment to pick out what Elend's tin-enhanced eyes had\nnoticed. On the northern side of the city—the one closest to the main canal route—the rock terraces and\nshelves fell down into a natural canyon. Perhaps twenty feet across, it was the only way into the city, and\nthe defenders had cut several troughs into the floor. They were bridged at the moment, of course, but\ngetting through that narrow entryway, with pits in front of the army and archers presumably firing from the\nrocky shelves above, with a gate at the end . . ."

The last four had been jammed intentionally, requiring hours of effort to get them working.\n\"They rely on it too much,\" Elend said. \"If they survive our siege, they'll need to ship in supplies.\nAssuming any can be had.\"\nHam fell silent. Finally, he turned, looking back up the dark canal behind them. \"El,\" he said. \"I don't\nthink that much more will be traveling this canal. The boats barely made it this far—there's too much ash\nclogging it. If we go home, we'll do so on foot.\"\n\" 'If' we go home?\"\nHam shrugged. Despite the colder western weather, he still wore only a vest. Now that Elend was an\nAllomancer, he could finally understand the habit. While burning pewter, Elend barely felt the chill, though\nseveral of the soldiers had complained about it in the mornings.\n\"I don't know, El,\" Ham finally said. \"It just seems portentous to me. Our canal closing behind us as\nwe travel. Kind of like fate is trying to strand us here.\"\n\"Ham,\" Elend said, \"everything seems portentous to you. We'll be fine.\"\nHam shrugged.\n\"Organize our forces,\" Elend said, pointing. \"Dock us in that inlet over there, and set up camp on the\nmesa.\"\nHam nodded. He was still looking backward, however. Toward Luthadel, which they had left behind.\nThey don't fear the mists, Elend thought, staring up through the darkness at the rocky formations that\nmarked the entrance into Fadrex City. Bonfires blazed up there, lighting the night. Often, such lights were\nfutile—signifying man's fear of the mists. These fires were different, somehow. They seemed a warning; a\nbold declaration of confidence. They burned brightly, high, as if floating in the sky.\nElend turned, walking into his illuminated commander's tent, where a small group of people sat waiting\nfor him. Ham, Cett, and Vin. Demoux was absent, still recovering from mistsickness.\nWe're spread thin, Elend thought. Spook and Breeze in the North, Penrod back at Luthadel, Felt\nwatching the storage cache in the East . . .\n\"All right,\" Elend said, letting the tent flaps close behind him. \"Looks like they're holed up in there\npretty well.\"\n\"Initial scout reports are in, El,\" Ham said. \"We're guessing about twenty-five thousand defenders.\"\n\"Not as many as I expected,\" Elend said.\n\"That bastard Yomen has to keep control of the rest of my kingdom,\" Cett said. \"If he pulled all of his\ntroops into the capital, the other cities would overthrow him.\"\n\"What?\" Vin asked, sounding amused. \"You think they'd rebel and switch back to your side?\"\n\"No,\" Cett said, \"they'd rebel and try to take over the kingdom themselves! That's the way this works."

That's the way this works.\nNow that the Lord Ruler is gone, every little lord or petty obligator with half a taste of power thinks he\ncan run a kingdom. Hell, I tried it—so did you.\"\n\"We were successful,\" Ham pointed out.\n\"And so was Lord Yomen,\" Elend said, folding his arms. \"He's held this kingdom since Cett marched\non Luthadel.\"\n\"He all but forced me out,\" Cett admitted. \"He had half the nobility turned against me before I even\nstruck toward Luthadel. I said I was leaving him in charge, but we both knew the truth. He's a clever\none—clever enough to know he can hold that city against a larger force, letting him spread his troops out\nto maintain the kingdom, and to endure a longer siege without running out of supplies.\"\n\"Unfortunately, Cett's probably right,\" Ham said. \"Our initial reports placed Yomen's forces at\nsomewhere around eighty thousand men. He'd be a fool to not have a few units within striking distance of\nour camp. We'll have to be wary of raids.\"\n\"Double the guards and triple scout patrols,\" Elend said, \"particularly during the early morning hours,\nwhen the daymist is out to obscure, but the sun is up to provide light.\"\nHam nodded.\n\"Also,\" Elend said thoughtfully, \"order the men to stay in their tents during the mists—but tell them to\nbe ready for a raid. If Yomen thinks that we're afraid to come out, perhaps we can bait one of his\n'surprise' attacks against us.\"\n\"Clever,\" Ham said.\n\"That won't get us past those natural walls, though,\" Elend said, folding his arms. \"Cett, what do you\nsay?\"\n\"Hold the canal,\" Cett said. \"Post sentries up around those upper rock formations to make certain that\nYomen doesn't resupply the city via secret means. Then, move on.\"\n\"What?\" Ham asked with surprise.\nElend eyed Cett, trying to decide what the man meant. \"Attack surrounding cities? Leave a force here\nthat's large enough to stymie a siege-break, then capture other parts of his territory?\"\nCett nodded. \"Most of the cities around here aren't fortified at all. They'd cave in without a fight.\"\n\"A good suggestion,\" Elend said. \"But we won't do it.\"\n\"Why not?\" Cett asked.\n\"This isn't just about conquering your homeland back, Cett,\" Elend said. \"Our primary reason for\ncoming here is to secure that storage cache—and I hope to do that without resorting to pillaging the\ncountryside.\"\nCett snorted. \"What do you expect to find in there? Some magical way to stop the ash? Even atium\nwouldn't do that.\"\n\"Something's in there,\" Elend said. \"It's the only hope we have.\"\nCett shook his head. \"You've been chasing a puzzle left by the Lord Ruler for the better part of a year,\nElend. Hasn't it ever occurred to you that the man was a sadist? There's no secret. No magical way out"

If we're going to survive the next few years, we're going to have to do it on our own—and that\nmeans securing the Western Dominance. The plateaus in this area represent some of the most elevated\nfarmland in the empire—and higher altitude means closer to the sun. If you're going to find plants that\nsurvive despite the daymists, you'll have to grow them here.\"\nThey were good arguments. But I can't give up, Elend thought. Not yet. Elend had read the reports\nof supplies back in Luthadel, and had seen the projections. Ash was killing crops as much or more than\nthe mists were. More land wouldn't save his people—they needed something else. Something that, he\nhoped, the Lord Ruler left for them.\nThe Lord Ruler didn't hate his people, and he wouldn't want them to die out, even if he were\ndefeated. He left food, water, supplies. And, if he knew secrets, he would have hidden them in the\ncaches. There will be something here.\nThere has to be.\n\"The cache remains our primary target,\" Elend said. To the side, he could see Vin smiling.\n\"Fine,\" Cett said, sighing. \"Then you know what we have to do.

Have the scouts search out streams that might run into the city—Cett,\npresumably you can help us locate some of these. And, once we get spies into the city, have them search\nout food stores that we can ruin.\"\n\"A good start,\" Cett said. \"Of course, there's one easy way to sow chaos in that city, to perhaps make\nthem surrender without a fight . . .\"\n\"We're not going to assassinate King Yomen,\" Elend said.\n\"Why not?\" Cett demanded. \"We've got two Mistborn. We'll have no difficulty killing off the Fadrex\nleadership.\"\n\"We don't work that way,\" Ham said, face growing dark.\n\"Oh?\" Cett asked. \"That didn't stop Vin from tearing a hole through my army and attacking me back\nbefore we teamed up.\"\n\"That was different,\" Ham said.\n\"No,\" Elend said, interrupting. \"It wasn't. The reason we're not going to assassinate Yomen, Cett, is\nbecause I want to try diplomacy first.\"\n\"Diplomacy?\" Cett asked. \"Didn't we just march an army of forty thousand soldiers on his city? That's\nnot a diplomatic move.\"\n\"True,\" Elend said, nodding. \"But we haven't attacked, not yet. Now that I'm here in person, I might as\nwell try talking before sending out knives in the night. We might be able to persuade Lord Yomen that an\nalliance will benefit him more than a war.\"\n\"If we make an alliance,\" Cett said, leaning forward in his chair, \"I don't get my city back.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said.\nCett frowned.\n\"You seem to be forgetting yourself, Cett,\" Elend said. \"You did not 'team up' with me.

I don't know what you expect me to find.\"\n\"Cett,\" Elend said, turning, \"I need names.

Assuming they still live in the city. Hell,\nassuming they're even still alive. Can't count on much these days.\"\nElend nodded. \"We won't take any further action until we have more information. Ham, make certain\nthe soldiers dig in well—use the field fortifications that Demoux taught them. Cett, see that those guard\npatrols get set up, and make certain our Tineyes remain alert and on watch. Vin will scout and see if she\ncan sneak into the cache like she did in Urteau. If we know what's in there, then we can better judge\nwhether to gamble on trying to conquer the city or not.\"\nThe various members of the group nodded, understanding that the meeting was over. As they left,\nElend stepped back out into the mists, looking up at the distant bonfires burning on the rocky heights.\nQuiet as a sigh, Vin stepped up to his side, following his gaze. She stood for a few moments. Then she\nglanced to the side, where a pair of soldiers were entering the tent to carry Cett away. Her eyes\nnarrowed in displeasure.\n\"I know,\" Elend said quietly, knowing that she was thinking of Cett again and his influence over Elend.\n\"You didn't deny that you might turn to assassination,\" Vin said softly.\n\"Hopefully it won't come to that.\"\n\"And if it does?\"\n\"Then I'll make the decision that is best for the empire.\"\nVin was silent for a moment. Then, she glanced at the fires up above.\n\"I could come with you,\" Elend offered.\nShe smiled, then kissed him. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"But you're noisy.\"\n\"Come now.

Elend passed it to Vin. \"Have fun,\" he said.\nShe dropped a coin between them, kissed him again, then shot up into the night.\nI am only just beginning to understand the brilliance of the Lord Ruler's cultural synthesis. One of\nthe benefits afforded him by being both immortal and—for all relevant purposes—omnipotent\nwas a direct and effective influence on the evolution of the Final Empire.\nHe was able to take elements from a dozen different cultures and apply them to his new,\n\"perfect\" society. For instance, the architectural brilliance of the Khlenni builders is manifest in\nthe keeps that the high nobility construct. Khlenni fashion sense—suits for gentlemen, gowns for\nladies—is another thing the Lord Ruler decided to appropriate.\nI suspect that despite his hatred of the Khlenni people—of whom Alendi was one—Rashek had\na deep-seated envy of them as well. The Terris of the time were pastoral herdsmen, the Khlenni\ncultured cosmopolitans. However ironic, it is logical that Rashek's new empire would mimic the\nhigh culture of the people he hated.\n26\nSPOOK STOOD IN HIS LITTLE ONE-ROOM LAIR, a room that was—of course—illegal. The\nCitizen forbade such places, places where a man could live unaccounted, unwatched. Fortunately,\nforbidding such places didn't eliminate them.\nIt only made them more expensive.\nSpook was lucky. He barely remembered leaping from the burning building, clutching six Allomantic\nvials, coughing and bleeding. He didn't at all remember making it back to his lair. He should probably be\ndead. Even surviving the fires, he should have been sold out—if the proprietor of his little illegal inn had\nrealized who Spook was and what he'd escaped, the promise of reward would undoubtedly have been\nirresistible.\nBut, Spook had survived. Perhaps the other thieves in the lair thought he had been on the wrong side\nof a robbery. Or, perhaps they simply didn't care. Either way, he was able to stand in front of the room's\nsmall mirror, shirt off, looking in wonder at his wound.\nI'm alive, he thought. And . . .

But, if that were so, how had he gained the power of pewter?\nHe shook his head, reaching for his bandages, but paused as something twinkled in the mirror's\nreflection. He stepped closer, relying—as always—upon starlight from outside to provide illumination.\nWith his extreme tin senses, it was easy to see the bit of metal sticking from the skin in his shoulder, even\nthough it only protruded a tiny fraction of an inch.\nThe tip of that man's sword, Spook realized, the one that stabbed me. It broke—the end must\nhave gotten embedded in my skin. He gritted his teeth, reaching to pull it free.\n\"No,\" Kelsier said. \"Leave it. It, like the wound you bear, is a sign of your survival.\"\nSpook started. He glanced about, but there was no apparition this time. Just the voice. Yet, he was\ncertain he'd heard it.\n\"Kelsier?\" he hesitantly asked.\nThere was no response.\nAm I going mad? Spook wondered. Or . . . is it like the Church of the Survivor teaches? Could it\nbe that Kelsier had become something greater, something that watched over his followers? And, if so,\ndid Kelsier always watch him? That felt a little bit . . . unsettling. However, if it brought him the power of\npewter, then who was he to complain?\nSpook turned and put his shirt on, stretching his arm again. He needed more information. How long\nhad he been delirious? What was Quellion doing? Had the others from the crew arrived yet?\nTaking his mind off of his strange visions for the moment, he slipped out of his room and onto the dark\nstreet. As lairs went, his wasn't all that impressive—a room behind the hidden door in a slum alleyway\nwall. Still, it was better than living in one of the crowded shanties he passed as he made his way through\nthe dark, mist-covered city.\nThe Citizen liked to pretend that everything was perfect in his little utopia, but Spook had not been\nsurprised to find that it had slums, just like every other city he'd ever visited.

        "text": "The Citizen liked to pretend that everything was perfect in his little utopia, but Spook had not been\nsurprised to find that it had slums, just like every other city he'd ever visited. There were many people in\nUrteau who, for one reason or another, weren't fond of living in the parts of town where the Citizen could\nkeep watch on them. These had aggregated in a place known as the Harrows, a particularly cramped\ncanal far from the main trenches.\nThe Harrows was clogged with a disorderly mash of wood and cloth and bodies. Shacks leaned\nagainst shacks, buildings leaned precariously against earth and rock, and the entire mess piled on top of\nitself, creeping up the canal walls toward the dark sky above. Here and there, people slept under only a\ndirty sheet stretched between two bits of urban flotsam—their millennium-old fear of the mists giving way\nbefore simple necessity.\nSpook shuffled down the crowded canal. Some of the piles of half-buildings reached so high and wide\nthat the sky narrowed to a mere crack far above, shining down its midnight light, too dim to be of use to\nany eyes but Spook's.\nPerhaps the chaos was why the Citizen chose not to visit the Harrows. Or, perhaps he was simply\nwaiting to clean them out until he had a better grip on his kingdom. Either way, his strict society, mixed\nwith the poverty it was creating, made for a curiously open nighttime culture. The Lord Ruler had\npatrolled the streets. The Citizen, however, preached that the mists were of Kelsier—and so could hardly\nforbid people to go out in them. Urteau was the first place in Spook's experience where a person could\nwalk down a street at midnight and find a small tavern open and serving drinks. He moved inside, cloak\npulled tight. There was no proper bar, just a group of dirty men sitting around a dug-out firepit in the\nground. Others sat on stools or boxes in the corners. Spook found an empty box, and sat down.\nThen he closed his eyes and listened, filtering through the conversations. He could hear them all, of\ncourse—even with his earplugs in. So much about being a Tineye wasn't about what you could hear, but\nwhat you could ignore.\nFootsteps thumped near him, and he opened his eyes. A man wearing trousers sewn with a dozen\ndifferent buckles and chains stopped in front of Spook, then thumped a bottle on the ground. \"Everyone\ndrinks,\" the man said. \"I have to pay to keep this place warm. Nobody just sits for free.\"\n\"What have you got?\" Spook asked.\nThe bartender kicked the bottle. \"House Venture special vintage. Aged fifty years. Used to go for six\nhundred boxings a bottle.\"\nSpook smiled, fishing out a pek—a coin minted by the Citizen to be worth a fraction of a copper clip.\nA combination of economic collapse and the Citizen's disapproval of luxury meant that a bottle of wine\nthat had once been worth hundreds of boxings was now practically worthless.\n\"Three for the bottle,\" the bartender said, holding out his hand.\nSpook brought out two more coins. The bartender left the bottle on the floor, and so Spook picked it\nup. He had been offered no corkscrew or cup—both likely cost extra, though this vintage of wine did"

He had been offered no corkscrew or cup—both likely cost extra, though this vintage of wine did\nhave a cork that stuck up a few inches above the bottle's lip. Spook eyed it.\nI wonder. . . .\nHe had his pewter on a low burn—not flared like his tin. Just there enough to help with the fatigue and\nthe pain. In fact, it did its job so well that he'd nearly forgotten about his wound during the walk to the\nbar. He stoked the pewter a bit, and the rest of the wound's pain vanished. Then, Spook grabbed the\ncork, pulling it with a quick jerk. It came free of the bottle with barely a hint of resistance.\nSpook tossed the cork aside. I think I'm going to like this, he thought with a smile.\nHe took a drink of the wine straight from the bottle, listening for interesting conversations. He had\nbeen sent to Urteau to gather information, and he wouldn't be much use to Elend or the others if he\nstayed lying in bed. Dozens of muffled conversations echoed in the room, most of them harsh. This wasn't\nthe kind of place where one found men loyal to the local government—which was precisely why Spook\nhad found his way to the Harrows in the first place.\n\"They say he's going to get rid of coins,\" a man whispered at the main firepit. \"He's making plans to\ngather them all up, keep them in his treasury.\"\n\"That's foolish,\" another voice replied. \"He minted his own coins—why take them now?\"\n\"It's true,\" the first voice said. \"I seen him speak on it myself. He says that men shouldn't have to rely\non coins—that we should have everything together, not having to buy and sell.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler never let skaa have coins either,\" another voice grumbled. \"Seems that the longer old\nQuellion is in charge, the more he looks like that rat the Survivor killed.\"\nSpook raised an eyebrow, taking another chug of wine. Vin, not Kelsier, was the one who had killed\nthe Lord Ruler. Urteau, however, was a significant distance from Luthadel. They probably hadn't even\nknown about the Lord Ruler's fall until weeks after it happened. Spook moved on to another\nconversation, searching for those who spoke in furtive whispers. He found exactly what he was listening\nfor in a couple of men sharing a bottle of fine wine as they sat on the floor in the corner.\n\"He has most everyone catalogued now,\" the man whispered. \"But he's not done yet. He has those\nscribes of his, the genealogists. They're asking questions, interrogating neighbors and friends, trying to\ntrace everyone back five generations, looking for noble blood.\"\n\"But, he only kills those who have noblemen back two generations.\"\n\"There's going to be a division,\" the other voice whispered. \"Every man who is pure back five\ngenerations will be allowed to serve in the government. Everyone else will be forbidden. It's a time when\na man could make a great deal of coin if he could help people hide certain events in their past.\"\nHum, Spook thought, taking a swig of wine.

Oddly, the alcohol didn't seem to be affecting him very\nmuch. The pewter, he realized. It strengthens the body, makes it more resistant to pains and\nwounds. And, perhaps, helps it avoid intoxication?\nHe smiled. The ability to drink and not grow drunk—an advantage of pewter that nobody had told him\nabout. There had to be a way to use such a skill.\nHe turned his attention to other bar patrons, searching for useful tidbits. Another conversation spoke\nof work in the mines. Spook felt a chill and a flicker of remembrance. The men spoke of a coal mine, not\na gold mine, but the grumbles were the same. Cave-ins. Dangerous gas. Stuffy air and uncaring\ntaskmasters.\nThat would have been my life, Spook thought. If Clubs hadn't come for me.\nTo this day, he still didn't understand. Why had Clubs traveled so far—visiting the distant eastern\nreaches of the Final Empire—to rescue a nephew he'd never met? Surely there had been young\nAllomancers in Luthadel who had been equally deserving of his protection.\nClubs had spent a fortune, traveled a long distance in an empire where skaa were forbidden to leave\ntheir home cities, and had risked betrayal by Spook's father. For that, Clubs had earned the loyalty of a\nwild street boy who—before that time—had run from any authority figure who tried to control him.\nWhat would it be like? Spook thought. If Clubs hadn't come for me, I would never have been in\nKelsier's crew. I might have hidden my Allomancy and refused to use it. I might have simply gone\nto the mines, living my life like any other skaa.\nThe men commiserated about the deaths of several who had fallen to a cave-in. It seemed that for\nthem, little had changed since the days of the Lord Ruler. Spook's life would have been like theirs, he\nsuspected. He'd be out in those Eastern wastes, living in sweltering dust when outside, working in\ncramped confines the rest of the time.\nMost of his life, it seemed that he had been a flake of ash, pushed around by whatever strong wind\ncame his way. He'd gone where people told him to go, done what they'd wanted him to. Even as an\nAllomancer, Spook had lived his life as a nobody. The others had been great men. Kelsier had organized\nan impossible revolution. Vin had struck down the Lord Ruler himself. Clubs had led the armies of\nrevolution, becoming Elend's foremost general. Sazed was a Keeper, and had carried the knowledge of\ncenturies. Breeze had moved waves of people with his clever tongue and powerful Soothing, and Ham\nwas a powerful soldier. But Spook, he had simply watched, not really doing anything.\nUntil the day he ran away, leaving Clubs to die.\nSpook sighed, looking up. \"I just want to be able to help,\" he whispered.\n\"You can,\" Kelsier's voice said. \"You can be great. Like I was.\"\nSpook started, glancing about. But, nobody else appeared to have heard the voice. Spook sat back"

However, the words made sense. Why did he always berate himself so much? True,\nKelsier hadn't picked him to be on the crew, but now the Survivor himself had appeared to Spook and\ngranted him the power of pewter.\nI could help the people of this city, he thought. Like Kelsier helped those of Luthadel. I could do\nsomething important: bring Urteau into Elend's empire, deliver the storage cache as well as the\nloyalty of the people.\nI ran away once. I don't ever have to do that again. I won't ever do that again!\nSmells of wine, bodies, ash, and mold hung in the air. Spook could feel the very grain in the stool\nbeneath him despite his clothing, the movements of people throughout the building shuffling and vibrating\nthe ground beneath his feet. And, with all of this, pewter burned inside of him. He flared it, made it strong\nalongside his tin. The bottle cracked in his hand, his fingers pressing too hard, though he released it\nquickly enough to keep it from shattering. It fell toward the floor, and he snatched it from the air with his\nother hand, the arm moving with blurring quickness.\nSpook blinked, awed at the speed of his own motions. Then, he smiled. I'm going to need more\npewter, he thought.\n\"That's him.\"\nSpook froze. Several of the conversations in the room had stopped, and to his ears—accustomed to a\ncacophony—the growing silence was eerie. He glanced to the side. The men who had been speaking of\nthe mines were looking at Spook, speaking softly enough that they probably assumed he couldn't hear\nthem.\n\"I'm telling you I saw him get run through by the guards. Everyone thought he was dead even before\nthey burned him.\"\nNot good, Spook thought. He hadn't thought himself memorable enough for people to notice. But . . .\nthen again, he had attacked a group of soldiers in the middle of the city's busiest market.\n\"Durn's been talking about him,\" the voice continued. \"Said he was of the Survivor's own crew . . .\"\nDurn, Spook thought. So he does know who I really am. Why has he been telling people my\nsecrets? I thought he was more careful than that.\nSpook stood up as nonchalantly as he could, then fled into the night.\nYes, Rashek made good use of his enemy's culture in developing the Final Empire. Yet, other\nelements of imperial culture were a complete contrast to Khlennium and its society. The lives of\nthe skaa were modeled after the slave peoples of the Canzi. The Terris stewards resembled the\nservant class of Urtan, which Rashek conquered relatively late in his first century of life.\nThe imperial religion, with its obligators, actually appears to have arisen from the bureaucratic\nmercantile system of the Hallant, a people who were very focused on weights, measures, and\npermissions.

The fact that the Lord Ruler would base his Church on a financial institution shows\n—in my opinion—that he worried less about true faith in his followers, and more about stability,\nloyalty, and quantifiable measures of devotion.\n27\nVIN SHOT THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT AIR. Mist swirled about her, a spinning, seething\nstorm of white upon black. It darted close to her body, as if snapping at her, but never came closer than\na few inches away—as if blown back by some current of air. She remembered a time when the mist had\nskimmed close to her skin, rather than being repelled. The transition had been gradual; it had taken\nmonths before she had realized the change.\nShe wore no mistcloak. It felt odd to be leaping about in the mists without one of the garments, but in\ntruth, she was quieter this way. Once, the mistcloak had been useful in making guards or thieves turn\naway at her passing. However, like the era of friendly mists, that time had passed. So, instead, she wore\nonly a black shirt and trousers, both closely fitted to her body to keep the sounds of flapping fabric to a\nminimum. As always, she wore no metal save for the coins in her pouch and an extra vial of metals in her\nsash. She pulled out a coin now—its familiar weight wrapped in a layer of cloth—and threw it beneath\nher. A Push against the metal sent it slamming into the rocks below, but the cloth dampened the sound of\nits striking. She used the Push to slow her descent, popping her up slightly into the air.\nShe landed carefully on a rock ledge, then Pulled the coin back into her hand. She crept across the\nrocky shelf, fluffy ash beneath her toes. A short distance away, a small group of guards sat in the\ndarkness, whispering quietly, watching Elend's army camp—which was now little more than a haze of\ncampfire light in the mists. The guards spoke of the spring chill, commenting that it seemed colder this\nyear than it had in previous ones. Though Vin was barefoot, she rarely noticed the cold. A gift of pewter.\nVin burned bronze, and heard no pulsings. None of the men were burning metals. One of the reasons\nCett had come to Luthadel in the first place was because he'd been unable to raise enough Allomancers\nto protect him from Mist-born assassins. No doubt Lord Yomen had experienced similar trouble\nrecruiting Allomancers, and he probably wouldn't have sent those he did have out into the cold to watch\nan enemy camp.\nVin crept past the guard post. She didn't need Allomancy to keep her quiet—she and her brother,\nReen, had sometimes been burglars, sneaking into homes. She had a lifetime of training that Elend would\nnever know or understand. He could practice with pewter all he liked—and he really was getting\nbetter—but he'd never be able to replicate instincts honed by a childhood spent sneaking to stay alive.\nAs soon as she was past the guard post, she jumped into the mists again, using her sound-deadened\ncoins as anchors.

She gave the fires at the front of the city a wide berth, instead rounding to the rear of\nFadrex. Most of the patrols would be at the front of the city, for the back was protected by the steep\nwalls of the rising rock formations. Of course, that barely inconvenienced Vin, and she soon found herself\ndropping several hundred feet through the air along a rock wall before landing in an alley at the very back\nof the city.\nShe took to the roofs and did a quick survey, jumping from street to street in wide Allomantic leaps.\nShe was quickly impressed with Fadrex's size. Elend had called the city \"provincial,\" and Vin had\nimagined a town barely larger than a village. Once they'd arrived, she'd instead begun to imagine a\nbarricaded, austere city—more like a fort. Fadrex was neither.\nShe should have realized that Elend—who had been raised in the sprawling metropolis of\nLuthadel—would have a skewed concept of what constituted a large city. Fadrex was plenty big. Vin\ncounted several skaa slums, a smattering of noble mansions, and even two Luthadel-style keeps. The\ngrand stone structures sported the typical arrangement of stained-glass windows and soaring, buttressed\nwalls. These were undoubtedly the homes of the most important nobles in the city.\nShe landed on a rooftop near one of the keeps. Most of the buildings in the city were only a single\nstory or two, which was quite a change from the high tenements of Luthadel. They were spaced out a bit\nmore, and tended to be flat and squat, rather than tall and peaked. That only made the massive keep\nseem so much larger by comparison. The building was rectangular, with a row of three peaked towers\nrising from each end. Ornamented white stonework ran around the entire perimeter at the top.\nAnd the walls, of course, were lined with beautiful stained-glass windows, lit from inside. Vin crouched\non a low rooftop, looking at the colored beauty of the swirling mists. For a moment, she was taken back\nto a time three years before, when she had attended balls in keeps like this one in Luthadel as part of\nKelsier's plan to overthrow the Final Empire. She had been an uncertain, nervous thing back then,\nworried that her newfound world of a trustworthy crew and beautiful parties would collapse around her.\nAnd, in a way, it had—for that world was gone. She had helped to destroy it.\nYet, during those months, she had been content. Perhaps more content than any other time in her life.\nShe loved Elend, and was glad life had progressed to the point where she could call him husband, but\nthere had been a delicious innocence about her early days with the crew. Dances spent with Elend\nreading at her table, pretending to ignore her. Nights spent learning the secrets of Allomancy. Evenings\nspent sitting around the table at Clubs's shop, sharing laughter with the crew. They'd faced the challenge\nof planning something as large as the fall of an empire, yet felt no burden of leadership or weight of\nresponsibility for the future.\nSomehow, she had grown into a woman in between the fall of kings and collapse of worlds.

Then she had been terrified of losing Elend. Now her fears were more\nnebulous—worries of what would come after she was gone, worries of what would happen to the people\nof the empire if she failed to divine the secrets she sought.\nShe turned from her contemplation of the large, castle-like keep, Pushing herself off of a chimney\nbrace and into the night. Attending those balls in Luthadel had changed her dramatically, leaving a\nresidual effect that she'd never been able to shake. Something within her had responded instantly to the\ndancing and the parties. For the longest time, she'd struggled to understand how that part of her fit into\nthe rest of her life. She still wasn't certain she knew the answer. Was Valette Renoux—the girl she had\npretended to be at the balls—really a part of Vin, or just a fabrication devised to serve Kelsier's plot?\nVin bounded across the city, making cursory notes of fortifications and troop placements. Ham and\nDemoux would probably find a way to get true military spies into the city eventually, but they'd want to\nhear preliminary information from Vin. She also made note of living conditions. Elend had hoped that the\ncity would be struggling, a factor that his siege would exacerbate, making Lord Yomen more likely to\ncapitulate.\nShe found no obvious signs of mass starvation or disrepair—though it was difficult to tell much at night.\nStill, the city streets were kept swept of ash, and a remarkable number of the noble homes appeared\noccupied. She would have expected the noble population to be the first to bolt at news of an\napproaching army.\nFrowning to herself, Vin completed her loop of the city, landing in a particular square that Cett had\nsuggested. The mansions here were separated from each other by large grounds and cultivated trees; she\nwalked along the street, counting them off. At the fourth mansion, she leaped up and over the gate, then\nmoved up the hill to the house.\nShe wasn't certain what she expected to find—Cett had been absent from the city for two years, after\nall. Yet, he'd indicated that this informant was the most likely to be of help. True to Cett's instructions, the\nrear balcony of the mansion was lit. Vin waited in the darkness suspiciously, the mist cold and unfriendly,\nyet providing cover. She didn't trust Cett—she worried that he still bore her a grudge for her attack on\nhis keep in Luthadel a year before. Wary, she dropped a coin and launched herself into the air.\nA lone figure sat on the balcony, fitting the description in Cett's instructions. Those same instructions\ngave this informant the nickname Slowswift. The old man appeared to be reading by the light of a lamp.\nVin frowned, but as instructed, she landed on the balcony railing, crouching beside a ladder that would\nhave allowed a more mundane visitor to approach.\nThe old man did not look up from his book. He puffed quietly on a pipe, a thick woolen blanket\nacross his knees. Vin wasn't certain if he noticed her or not. She cleared her throat.\n\"Yes, yes,\" the old man said calmly. \"I shall be with you in a moment.\""

He\nwas dressed in a nobleman's suit, with a scarf and an overcoat that bore an oversized fur collar. He\nappeared to be completely unconcerned by the Mistborn crouching on his railing. Eventually, the elderly\nman closed his book, then turned toward her. \"Do you enjoy stories, young lady?\"\n\"What kind of stories?\"\n\"The best kind, of course,\" Slowswift said, tapping his book. \"The kind about monsters and myths.\nLongtales, some call them—stories told by skaa around the fires, whispering of mistwraiths, sprites, and\nbrollins and such.\"\n\"I don't have much time for stories,\" Vin said.\n\"Seems that fewer and fewer people do, these days.\" A canopy kept off the ash, but he seemed\nunconcerned about the mists. \"It makes me wonder what is so alluring about the real world that gives\nthem all such a fetish for it. It's not a very nice place these days.\"\nVin did a quick check with bronze, but the man burned nothing. What was his game? \"I was told that\nyou could give me information,\" she said carefully.\n\"That I can certainly do,\" the man said. Then he smiled, glancing at her. \"I have a wealth of\ninformation—though somehow I suspect that you might find most of it useless.\"\n\"I'll listen to a story, if that's what it will cost.\"\nThe man chuckled. \"There's no surer way to kill a story than to make it a 'cost,' young lady. What is\nyour name, and who sent you?\"\n\"Vin Venture,\" Vin said. \"Cett gave me your name.\"\n\"Ah,\" the man said. \"That scoundrel still alive?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, I suppose I could chat with someone sent by an old writing friend. Come down off that\nrailing—you're giving me vertigo.\"\nVin climbed down, wary. \"Writing friend?\"\n\"Cett is one of the finest poets I know, child,\" said Slowswift, waving her toward a chair. \"We shared\nour work with one another for a good decade or so before politics stole him away. He didn't like stories\neither. To him, everything had to be gritty and 'real,' even his poetry. Seems like an attitude with which\nyou'd agree.\"\nVin shrugged, sitting in the indicated chair. \"I suppose.\"\n\"I find that ironic in a way you shall never understand,\" the old man said, smiling. \"Now, what is it you\nwish of me?\"\n\"I need to know about Yomen, the obligator king.\"\n\"He's a good man.\"\nVin frowned.\n\"Oh,\" Slowswift said. \"You didn't expect that? Everyone who is your enemy must also be an evil\nperson?\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, thinking back to the days before the fall of the Final Empire. \"I ended up marrying\nsomeone my friends would have named an enemy.\"\n\"Ah.

The smoke mixed with the\nswirling mists. \"Plus, he gave both nobility and skaa what they wanted.\"\n\"Which was?\"\n\"Stability, child. For a time, the world was in turmoil—neither skaa nor nobleman knew his place.\nSociety was collapsing, and people were starving. Cett did little to stop that—he fought constantly to\nkeep what he'd killed to obtain. Then Yomen stepped in. People saw authority in him. Before the\nCollapse, the Lord Ruler's Ministry had ruled, and the people were ready to accept an obligator as a\nleader. Yomen immediately took control of the plantations and brought food to his people, then he\nreturned the factories to operation, started work in the Fadrex mines again, and gave the nobility a\nsemblance of normalcy.\"\nVin sat quietly. Before, it might have seemed incredible to her that—after a thousand years of\noppression—the people would willingly return to slavery. Yet, something similar had happened in\nLuthadel. They had ousted Elend, who had granted them great freedoms, and had put Penrod in\ncharge—all because he promised them a return to what they had lost.\n\"Yomen is an obligator,\" she said.\n\"People like what is familiar, child.\"\n\"They're oppressed.\"\n\"Someone must lead,\" the old man said. \"And, someone must follow. That is the way of things. Yomen\nhas given the people something they've been crying for since the Collapse—identity. The skaa may work,\nthey may be beaten, they may be enslaved, but they know their place. The nobility may spend their time\ngoing to balls, but there is an order to life again.\"\n\"Balls?\" Vin asked. \"The world is ending, and Yomen is throwing balls?\"\n\"Of course,\" Slowswift said, taking a long, slow puff on his pipe. \"Yomen rules by maintaining the\nfamiliar. He gives the people what they had before—and balls were a large part of life before the\nCollapse, even in a smaller city like Fadrex. Why, there is one happening tonight, at Keep Orielle.\"\n\"On the very day an army arrived to besiege the city?\"\n\"You just pointed out that the world seems very close to disaster,\" the old man said, pointing at her\nwith his pipe. \"In the face of that, an army doesn't mean much. Plus, Yomen understands something even\nthe Lord Ruler didn't—Yomen always personally attends the balls thrown by his subjects. In doing so, he\ncomforts and reassures them. That makes a day like this, when an army arrived, a perfect day for a ball.\"\nVin sat back, uncertain what to think. Of all the things she had expected to find in the city, courtly balls\nwere very low on the list. \"So,\" she said. \"What's Yomen's weakness? Is there something in his past that"

Where should we strike?\"\nSlowswift puffed quietly on his pipe, a breeze blowing mist and ash across his elderly figure.\n\"Well?\" Vin asked.\nThe old man let out a breath of mist and smoke. \"I just told you that I like the man, child. What would\npossess me to give you information to use against him?\"\n\"You're an informant,\" Vin said. \"That's what you do—sell information.\"\n\"I'm a storyteller,\" Slowswift corrected. \"And not every story is meant for every set of ears. Why\nshould I talk to those who would attack my city and overthrow my liege?\"\n\"We'd give you a powerful position in the city once it is ours.\"\nSlowswift snorted quietly. \"If you think such things would interest me, then Cett obviously told you\nlittle regarding my temperament.\"\n\"We could pay you well.\"\n\"I sell information, child. Not my soul.\"\n\"You're not being very helpful,\" Vin noted.\n\"And tell me, dear child,\" he said, smiling slightly. \"Why exactly should I care?\"\nVin frowned. This is, she thought, undoubtedly the strangest informant meeting I've ever been to.\nSlowswift puffed on his pipe. He didn't appear to be waiting for her to say anything. In fact, he seemed\nto think the conversation was over.\nHe's a nobleman, Vin thought. He likes the way that the world used to be. It was comfortable.\nEven skaa fear change.\nVin stood. \"I'll tell you why you should care, old man. Because the ash is falling, and soon it will cover\nup your pretty little city. The mists kill. Earthquakes shake the landscape, and the ashmounts burn hotter\nand hotter. Change is looming. Eventually, even Yomen won't be able to ignore it. You hate change. I\nhate it too. But things can't stay the same—and that's well, for when nothing changes in your life, it's as\ngood as being dead.\" She turned to leave.\n\"They say you'll stop the ash,\" the old man said quietly from behind. \"Turn the sun yellow again. They\ncall you Heir of the Survivor. Hero of Ages.\"\nVin paused, turning to look through the traitorous mist toward the man with his pipe and closed book.\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\"Seems like quite the destiny to live up to.\"\n\"It's either that or give up.\"\nSlowswift sat silently for a moment. \"Sit down, child,\" the old man finally said, gesturing toward the\nseat again.\nVin reseated herself.\n\"Yomen is a good man,\" Slowswift said, \"but only a mediocre leader. He's a bureaucrat, a member of\nthe Canton of Resource. He can make things happen—get supplies to the right places, organize\nconstruction projects. Ordinarily, that would have made him a good enough ruler. However . . .\"\n\"Not when the world is ending,\" Vin said softly.\n\"Precisely. If what I've heard is true, then your husband is a man of vision and action. If our little city is\ngoing to survive, then we'll need to be part of what you are offering.\"\n\"What do we do, then?\""

However, he\nhas an unfailing belief in the Lord Ruler and his organization.\"\n\"Even now?\" Vin asked. \"The Lord Ruler died!\"\n\"Yes, so?\" Slowswift asked, amused. \"And your Survivor? Last I checked, he was somewhat dead as\nwell. Didn't seem to hinder his revolution much, now did it?\"\n\"Good point.\"\n\"Yomen is a believer,\" Slowswift said. \"That may be a weakness; it may be a strength. Believers are\noften willing to attempt the seemingly impossible, then count on providence to see them through.\" He\npaused, glancing at Vin. \"That sort of behavior can be a weakness if the belief is misplaced.\"\nVin said nothing. Belief in the Lord Ruler was misplaced. If he'd been a god, then she wouldn't have\nbeen able to kill him. In her mind, it was a rather simple matter.\n\"If Yomen has another weakness,\" Slowswift said, \"it is his wealth.\"\n\"Hardly a weakness.\"\n\"It is if you can't account for its source. He got money somewhere—a suspiciously vast amount of it,\nfar more than even local Ministry coffers should have been able to provide. Nobody knows where it\ncame from.\"\nThe cache, Vin thought, perking up. He really does have the atium!\n\"You reacted a little too strongly to that one,\" Slowswift said, taking a puff on his pipe. \"You should try\nto give less away when speaking with an informant.\"\nVin flushed.\n\"Anyway,\" the old man said, turning back to his book, \"if that is all, I should like to return to my\nreading. Give my regards to Ashweather.\"\nVin nodded, rising and moving over toward the banister. As she did, however, Slowswift cleared his\nthroat. \"Usually,\" he noted, \"there is compensation for acts such as mine.\"\nVin raised an eyebrow. \"I thought you said that stories shouldn't cost.\"\n\"Actually,\" Slowswift noted, \"I said that a story itself shouldn't be a cost. That is very different from the\nstory itself costing something. And, while some will argue, I believe that a story without cost is one\nconsidered worthless.\"\n\"I'm sure that's the only reason,\" Vin said, smiling slightly as she tossed her bag of coins—minus a few\ncloth-covered ones to use for jumping—to the old man. \"Gold imperials. Still good here, I assume?\"\n\"Good enough,\" the old man said, tucking them away. \"Good enough . . .\"\nVin jumped out into the night, leaping a few houses away, burning bronze to see if she felt any\nAllomantic pulses from behind. She knew that her nature made her irrationally suspicious of people who\nappeared weak. For the longest time, she'd been convinced that Cett was Mistborn, simply because he\nwas paraplegic. Still, she checked on Slowswift. This was one old habit that she didn't feel much need to\nextinguish.\nNo pulses came from behind. Soon, she moved on, pulling out Cett's instructions, searching out a\nsecond informant. She trusted Slowswift's words well enough, but she would like confirmation. She"

She trusted Slowswift's words well enough, but she would like confirmation. She\npicked an informant on the other side of the spectrum—a beggar named Hoid whom Cett claimed could\nbe found in a particular square late at night.\nA few quick jumps brought her to the location. She landed atop a roof and looked down, scanning the\narea. The ash had been allowed to drift here, piling in corners, making a general mess of things. A group\nof lumps huddled in an alley beside the square. Beggars, without home or job. Vin had lived like that at\ntimes, sleeping in alleys, coughing up ash, hoping it wouldn't rain. She soon located a figure that wasn't\nsleeping like the others, but sitting quietly in the light ashfall. Her ears picked out a faint sound. The man\nwas humming to himself, as the instructions said that he might be doing.\nVin hesitated.\nShe couldn't decide what it was, but something bothered her about the situation. It wasn't right. She\ndidn't stop to think, she simply turned and jumped away. That was one of the big differences between her\nand Elend—she didn't always need a reason. A feeling was enough. He always wanted to tease things\nout and find a why, and she loved him for his logic. However, he would have been very frustrated about\nher decision to turn away from the square as she had.\nPerhaps nothing bad would have happened if she'd gone into the square. Perhaps something terrible\nwould have occurred. She would never know, nor did she need to know. As she had countless other\ntimes in her life, Vin simply accepted her instincts and moved on.\nHer flight took her along a street that Cett had noted in his instructions. Curious, Vin didn't search out\nanother informant, but instead followed the road, bounding from anchor to anchor in the pervasive mists.\nShe landed on a cobbled street a short distance from a building with lit windows.\nBlocky and utilitarian, the building was nonetheless daunting—if only because of its size. Cett had\nwritten that the Canton of Resource was the largest of the Steel Ministry buildings in the city. Fadrex had\nacted as a kind of way station between Luthadel and more important cities to the west. Near several\nmain canal routes and well fortified against banditry, the city was the perfect place for a Canton of\nResource regional headquarters. Yet, Fadrex hadn't been important enough to attract the Cantons of\nOrthodoxy or Inquisition—traditionally the most powerful of the Ministry departments.\nThat meant that Yomen, as head obligator at the Resource building, had been the area's top religious\nauthority. From what Slowswift said, Vin assumed that Yomen was pretty much a standard Resource\nobligator: dry, boring, but terribly efficient. And so, of course, he'd chosen to make his old Canton\nbuilding into his palace. It was what Cett had suspected, and Vin could easily see that it was true. The\nbuilding bustled with activity despite the late hour, and was guarded by platoons of soldiers. Yomen had\nprobably chosen the building in order to remind everyone where his authority originated.\nUnfortunately, it was also where the Lord Ruler's supply cache would be located. Vin sighed, turning"

Vin sighed, turning\nfrom her contemplation of the building. Part of her wanted to sneak in and try to find her way down to\nthe cavern beneath. Instead, she dropped a coin and shot herself into the air. Even Kelsier wouldn't have\ntried breaking into the place on his first night of scouting. She'd gotten into the one in Urteau, but it had\nbeen abandoned. She had to confer with Elend and study the city for a few days before she did\nsomething as bold as sneak into a fortified palace.\nUsing starlight and tin, Vin read off the name of the third and final informant. It was another nobleman,\nwhich wasn't surprising, considering Cett's own station. She began moving in the direction indicated.\nHowever, as she moved, she noticed something.\nShe was being followed.\nShe only caught hints of him behind her, obscured by the patterns of swirling mist. Tentatively, Vin\nburned bronze, and was rewarded with a very faint thumping from behind. An obscured Allomantic\npulse. Usually, when an Allomancer burned copper—as the one behind her was doing—it made him\ninvisible to the Allomantic bronze sense. Yet, for some reason Vin had never been able to explain, she\ncould see through this obfuscation. The Lord Ruler had been able to do likewise, as had his Inquisitors.\nVin continued to move. The Allomancer following her obviously believed himself—or\nherself—invisible to Vin's senses. He moved with quick, easy bounds, following at a safe distance. He\nwas good without being excellent, and he was obviously Mistborn, for only a Mistborn could have\nburned both copper and steel at the same time.\nVin wasn't surprised. She'd assumed that if there were any Mistborn in the city, her leaping would\ndraw their attention. Just in case, she hadn't bothered burning any copper herself, leaving her pulses open\nto be heard by anyone—Mistborn or Seeker—who was listening. Better an enemy drawn out than one\nhiding in the shadows.\nShe increased her pace, though not suspiciously so, and the person following had to move quickly to\nkeep up. Vin kept going toward the front of the city, as if planning to leave. As she got closer, her\nAllomantic senses produced twin blue lines pointing at the massive iron brackets holding the city gates to\nthe rock at their sides. The brackets were large, substantial sources of metal, and the lines they gave off\nwere bright and thick.\nWhich meant they would make excellent anchors. Flaring her pewter to keep from being crushed, Vin\nPushed on the brackets, throwing herself backward.\nImmediately, the Allomantic pulses behind her disappeared.\nVin shot through ash and mist, even her tight clothing flapping slightly from the wind. She quickly\nPulled herself down to a rooftop and crouched, tense. The other Allomancer must have stopped burning\nhis metals. But why would he do that? Did he know that she could pierce copperclouds? If he did, then\nwhy had he followed her so recklessly?\nVin felt a chill. There was something else that gave off Allomantic pulses in the night. The mist spirit."

In fact, during her last encounter with it, it had nearly killed Elend—only\nto then restore him by making him Mistborn.\nShe still didn't know how the spirit fit into all of this. It wasn't Ruin—she had felt Ruin's presence when\nshe'd freed him at the Well of Ascension. They were different.\nI don't even know if this was the spirit tonight, Vin told herself. Yet, the one tailing her had\nvanished so abruptly. . . .\nConfused, and chilled, she Pushed herself out of the city and quickly made her way back to Elend's\ncamp.\nOne final aspect of the Lord Ruler's cultural manipulation is quite interesting: that of technology.\nI have already mentioned that Rashek chose to use Khlenni architecture, which allowed him to\nconstruct large structures and gave him the civil engineering necessary to build a city as large as\nLuthadel. In other areas, however, he suppressed technological advancements. Gunpowder, for\ninstance, was so frowned upon by Rashek that knowledge of its use disappeared almost as quickly\nas knowledge of the Terris religion.\nApparently, Rashek found it alarming that armed with gunpowder weapons, even the most\ncommon of men could be nearly as effective as archers with years of training. And so, he favored\narchers. The more training-dependent military technology was, the less likely it was that the\npeasant population would be able to rise up and resist him. Indeed, skaa revolts always failed in\npart for this very reason.\n28\n\"ARE YOU SURE IT WAS THE MIST SPIRIT?\" Elend asked, frowning, a half-finished\nletter—scribed into a steel foil sheet—sitting on his desk before him. He'd decided to sleep in his cabin\naboard the narrowboat, rather than in a tent. Not only was it more comfortable, he felt more secure with\nwalls around him, as opposed to canvas.\nVin sighed, sitting down on their bed, pulling her legs up and setting her chin on her knees. \"I don't\nknow. I kind of got spooked, so I fled.\"\n\"Good thing,\" Elend said, shivering as he remembered what the mist spirit had done to him.\n\"Sazed was convinced that the mist spirit wasn't evil,\" Vin said.\n\"So was I,\" Elend said. \"If you'll remember, I'm the one who walked right up to it, telling you that I felt\nit was friendly. That was right about the time it stabbed me.\"\nVin shook her head. \"It was trying to keep me from releasing Ruin. It thought that if you were dying, I\nwould take the power for myself and heal you, rather than giving it up.\"\n\"You don't know its intentions for certain, Vin. You could be connecting coincidences in your mind.\"\n\"Perhaps. However, it led Sazed to discover that Ruin was altering text.\"\nThat much, at least, was true—if, indeed, Sazed's account of the matter could be trusted.

He might be struggling with his faith, but he is still\ntwice as reliable as the rest of us.\n\"Oh, Elend,\" Vin said softly. \"There's so much we don't know. Lately, I feel like my life is a book\nwritten in a language I don't know how to read. The mist spirit is related to all this, but I can't even begin\nto fathom how.\"\n\"It's probably on our side,\" Elend said, though it was hard not to keep flashing back to memories of\nhow it had felt to be stabbed, to feel his life fading away. To die, knowing what it would do to Vin.\nHe forced himself back to the conversation at hand. \"You think the mist spirit tried to keep you from\nreleasing Ruin, and Sazed says it gave him important information. That makes it the enemy of our enemy.\"\n\"For the moment,\" Vin said. \"But, the mist spirit is much weaker than Ruin. I've felt them both. Ruin\nwas . . . vast. Powerful. It can hear whatever we say—can see all places at once. The mist spirit is far\nfainter. More like a memory than a real force or power.\"\n\"Do you still think it hates you?\"\nVin shrugged. \"I haven't seen it in over a year. Yet, I'm pretty sure that it isn't the sort of thing that\nchanges, and I always felt hatred and animosity from it.\" She paused, frowning. \"That was the beginning.\nThat night when I first saw the mist spirit was when I began to sense that the mists were no longer my\nhome.\"\n\"Are you sure the spirit isn't what kills people and makes them sick?\"\nVin nodded. \"Yes, I'm sure.\" She was adamant about this, though Elend felt she was a bit quick to\njudge. Something ghost-like, moving about in the mists? It seemed like just the kind of thing that would\nbe related to people dying suddenly in those same mists.\nOf course, the people who died in the mists didn't die of stabbings, but of a shaking disease. Elend\nsighed, rubbing his eyes. His unfinished letter to Lord Yomen sat on his desk—he'd have to get back to it\nin the morning.\n\"Elend,\" Vin said. \"Tonight, I told someone that I'd stop the ash from falling and turn the sun yellow.\"\nElend raised an eyebrow. \"That informant you spoke of?\"\nVin nodded. The two sat in silence.\n\"I never expected you to admit something like that,\" he finally said.\n\"I'm the Hero of Ages, aren't I? Even Sazed said so, before he started to go strange. It's my destiny.\"\n\"The same 'destiny' that said you would take up the power of the Well of Ascension, then release it for\nthe greater good of mankind?\"\nVin nodded.\n\"Vin,\" Elend said with a smile, \"I really don't think 'destiny' is the sort of thing we need to worry about\nright now. I mean, we have proof that the prophecies were twisted by Ruin in order to trick people into\nfreeing him.\"\n\"Someone has to worry about the ash,\" Vin said."

The logical side of him wanted to argue, claiming that they\nshould focus on the things they could do—making a stable government, uncovering the secrets left by the\nLord Ruler, securing the supplies in the caches. Yet, the constant ashfall seemed to be growing even\ndenser. If that continued, it wouldn't be long before the sky was nothing more than a solid black storm of\nash.\nIt just seemed so difficult to think that Vin—his wife—could do anything about the color of the sun or\nthe falling ash. Demoux is right, he thought, tapping his fingers across the metallic letter to Lord Yomen.\nI'm really not a very good member of the Church of the Survivor.\nHe looked across the cabin at her, sitting on the bed, expression distant as she thought about things\nthat shouldn't have to be her burden. Even after leaping about all night, even after their days spent\ntraveling, even with her face dirtied by ash, she was beautiful.\nAt that moment, Elend realized something. Vin didn't need another person worshipping her. She didn't\nneed another faithful believer like Demoux, especially not in Elend. He didn't need to be a good member\nof the Church of the Survivor. He needed to be a good husband.\n\"Well, then,\" he said. \"Let's do it.\"\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\n\"Save the world,\" Elend said. \"Stop the ash.\"\nVin snorted quietly. \"You make it sound like a joke.\"\n\"No, I'm serious,\" he said, standing. \"If this is what you feel you must do—what you feel that you\nare—then let's do it. I'll help however I can.\"\n\"What about your speech before?\" Vin said. \"In the last storage cavern—you talked about division of\nlabor. Me working on the mists, you working on uniting the empire.\"\n\"I was wrong.\"\nVin smiled, and suddenly Elend felt as if the world had been put back together just a bit.\n\"So,\" Elend said, sitting on the bed beside her. \"What have you got? Any thoughts?\"\nVin paused. \"Yes,\" she said. \"But I can't tell you.\"\nElend frowned.\n\"It's not that I don't trust you,\" Vin said. \"It's Ruin. In the last storage cavern, I found a second\ninscription on the plate, down near the bottom. It warned me that anything I speak—or that I write—will\nbe known by our enemy. So, if we talk too much, he will know our plans.\"\n\"That makes it a bit difficult to work on the problem together.\"\nVin took his hands. \"Elend, do you know why I finally agreed to marry you?\"\nElend shook his head.\n\"Because I realized that you trusted me,\" Vin said. \"Trusted me as nobody ever has before. On that\nnight, when I fought Zane, I decided that I had to give my trust to you. This force that's destroying the\nworld, we have something that it can never understand.

Then, he eyed her. \"Except for you, of\ncourse.\"\n\"I'm not about to drown myself, if that's what you're getting at.\"\n\"No,\" Elend said. \"I'm sorry. I'm just . . . well, you know. Anyway, I was explaining something. In the\nend, I stopped worrying about how strange you seemed. I realized that it didn't really matter if I\nunderstood you, because I trusted you. Does that make sense? Either way, I guess I'm saying that I\nagree. I don't really know what you're doing, and I don't have any clue how you're going to achieve it.\nBut, well, I trust that you'll do it.\"\nVin pulled close to him.\n\"I just wish there were something I could do to help,\" Elend said.\n\"Then take the whole numbers part,\" Vin said, frowning distastefully. Though she'd been the one to\nthink something was odd about the percentages of those who fell to the mists, Elend knew that she found\nnumbers troublesome. She didn't have the training, or the practice, to deal with them.\n\"You're sure that's even related?\" Elend asked.\n\"You were the one who thought that the percentages were so strange.\"\n\"Good point.

Maybe we can stay ahead of this\nthing.\"\nStay ahead of it? Elend thought. It has the power to bury the entire empire in ash, and can\napparently hear every single word we say. How do we \"stay ahead\" of something like that? But,\nhe had just promised to trust Vin, so he did so.\nVin pointed at the table. \"Is that your letter to Yomen?\"\nElend nodded. \"I'm hoping that he'll talk to me, now that I'm actually here.\"\n\"Slowswift does seem to think that Yomen is a good man.

That's why I brought my army in the first place—I could have just sent you to sneak in, like you\ndid in Urteau. However, sneaking in didn't help us much there; we still have to secure the city if we want\nthe supplies.\n\"We need this city. Even if you hadn't felt so driven to discover what was in the cache, I would have\ncome here. The threat Yomen poses to our kingdom is too strong, and the possibility that the Lord Ruler\nleft important information in that cache can't be ignored. Yomen has grain in that storage, but the land\nhere won't get enough sunlight to grow it. So, he'll probably feed it to the people—a waste, when we\ndon't have enough to plant and fill the Central Dominance. We have to take this city, or at least make an\nally out of it.\n\"But, what do I do if Yomen won't talk? Send armies to attack nearby villages? Poison the city's\nsupplies? If you're right, then he's found the cache, which means he'll have more food than we hoped.\nUnless we destroy that, he might outlast our siege. But, if I do destroy it, his people will starve . . .\" Elend\nshook his head. \"Do you remember when I executed Jastes?\"\n\"That was well within your right,\" Vin said quickly.\n\"I believe it was,\" Elend said. \"But I killed him because he led a group of koloss to my city, then let\nthem ravage my people. I've nearly done the same thing here. There are twenty thousand of the beasts\noutside.\"\n\"You can control them.\"\n\"Jastes thought he could control them too,\" Elend said. \"I don't want to turn those creatures loose, Vin.\nBut what if the siege fails, and I have to try and break Yomen's fortifications? I won't be able to do that\nwithout the koloss.\" He shook his head. \"If only I could talk to Yomen. Perhaps I could make him see\nreason, or at least convince myself that he needs to fall.\"\nVin paused. \"There . . . might be a way.\"\nElend glanced over, catching her eyes.\n\"They're still staging balls inside the city,\" Vin said. \"And King Yomen attends every one.\"\nElend blinked. At first, he assumed that he must have misunderstood her. However, the look in her\neyes—that wild determination—persuaded him otherwise. Sometimes, he saw a touch of the Survivor in\nher; or, at least, of the man the stories claimed Kelsier had been. Bold to the point of recklessness. Brave\nand brash. He'd rubbed off on Vin more than she liked to admit.\n\"Vin,\" he said flatly, \"did you just suggest that we attend a ball being held in the middle of a city we're\nbesieging?\"\nVin shrugged. \"Sure. Why not? We're both Mistborn—we can get into that city without much trouble\nat all.\"\n\"Yes, but . . .\" He trailed off."

We're both Mistborn—we can get into that city without much trouble\nat all.\"\n\"Yes, but . . .\" He trailed off.\nI'd have a room filled with the very nobility I'm hoping to intimidate—not to mention have\naccess to the man who refuses to meet with me, in a situation where he'd have trouble running\naway without looking like a coward.\n\"You think it's a good idea,\" Vin said, smiling impishly.\n\"It's a crazy idea,\" Elend said. \"I'm emperor—I shouldn't be sneaking into the enemy city so I can go\nto a party.\"\nVin narrowed her eyes, staring at him.\n\"I will admit, however,\" Elend said, \"that the concept does have considerable charm.\"\n\"Yomen won't come meet us,\" Vin said, \"so we go in and crash his party.\"\n\"It's been a while since I've been to a ball,\" Elend said speculatively. \"I'll have to dig up some good\nreading material for old time's sake.\"\nSuddenly, Vin grew pale. Elend paused, glancing at her, sensing that something was wrong. Not with\nwhat he'd said, something else. What is it? Assassins? Mist spirits? Koloss?\n\"I just realized something,\" Vin said, looking at him with those intense eyes of hers. \"I can't go to a\nball—I didn't bring a gown!\"\nThe Lord Ruler didn't just forbid certain technologies, he suppressed technological advancement\ncompletely. It seems odd now that during the entirety of his thousand-year reign, very little\nprogress was made. Farming techniques, architectural methods—even fashion remained\nremarkably stable during the Lord Ruler's reign.\nHe constructed his perfect empire, then tried to make it stay that way. For the most part, he\nwas successful. Pocket watches—another Khlenni appropriation—that were made in the tenth\ncentury of the empire were nearly identical to those made during the first. Everything stayed the\nsame.\nUntil it all collapsed, of course.\n29\nLIKE MOST CITIES IN THE FINAL EMPIRE, Urteau had been forbidden a city wall. In the early\ndays of Sazed's life, before he'd rebelled, the fact that cities couldn't build fortifications had always\nseemed a subtle indication to him of the Lord Ruler's vulnerability. After all, if the Lord Ruler was\nworried about rebellions and cities that could stand against him, then perhaps he knew something that\nnobody else did: that he could be defeated.\nThoughts like those had led Sazed to Mare, and finally to Kelsier. And now, they led him to the city of\nUrteau—a city that finally had rebelled against noble leadership. Unfortunately, it lumped Elend Venture\nin with all the other nobles.\n\"I don't like this, Master Keeper,\" Captain Goradel said, walking beside Sazed, who—for the sake of\nhis image—now rode in the carriage with Breeze and Allrianne. After leaving the Terris people behind,\nSazed had hurriedly caught up with Breeze and the others, and they were finally entering the city that was\ntheir destination.\n\"Things are supposed to be kind of brutal in there,\" Goradel continued. \"I don't think you'll be safe.\"\n\"I doubt it's as bad as you think,\" Sazed said."

This way, if someone gets captured, the king is still safe. We, my friend, are something\nElend can never be: expendable.\"\nGoradel frowned at that. \"I don't feel very expendable.\"\nSazed peered out of the carriage, looking at the city through the falling ash. It was large, and was one\nof the oldest cities in the empire. He noted with interest that as they approached, the road sloped\ndownward, entering an empty canal trough.\n\"What's this?\" Allrianne asked, sticking her blond head out of the other side of the carriage. \"Why'd\nthey build their roads in ditches?\"\n\"Canals, my dear,\" Breeze said. \"The city used to be filled with them. Now they're empty—an\nearthquake or something diverted a river.\"\n\"It's creepy,\" she said, bringing her head back in. \"It makes the buildings look twice as tall.\"\nAs they entered the city proper—their two hundred soldiers marching around them in formation—they\nwere met by a delegation of Urteau soldiers in brown uniforms. Sazed had sent word ahead of their\ncoming, of course, and the king—the Citizen, they called him—had given Sazed leave to bring his small\ncontingent of troops into the city.\n\"They say that their king wants to meet with you immediately, Master Terrisman,\" Goradel said,\nwalking back to the carriage.\n\"The man doesn't waste time, does he?\" Breeze asked.\n\"We'll go, then,\" Sazed said, nodding to Goradel.\n\"You aren't wanted here.\"\nQuellion, the Citizen, was a short-haired man with rough skin and an almost military bearing. Sazed\nwondered where the man—apparently a simple farmer before the Collapse—had gained such leadership\nskills.\n\"I realize that you have no desire to see foreign soldiers in your city,\" Sazed said carefully. \"However,\nyou must have realized that we do not come to conquer. Two hundred men is hardly an invading force.\"\nQuellion stood at his desk, arms clasped behind his back. He wore what appeared to be regular skaa\ntrousers and shirt, though both had been dyed a deep red verging on maroon. His \"audience chamber\"\nwas a large conference room in what had once been a nobleman's house. The walls had been\nwhitewashed and the chandelier removed. Stripped of its furniture and finery, the room felt like a box.\nSazed, Breeze, and Allrianne sat on hard wooden stools, the only comfort the Citizen had offered\nthem. Goradel stood at the back with ten of his soldiers as a guard.\n\"It isn't about the soldiers, Terrisman,\" Quellion said. \"It's about the man who sent you.\"\n\"Emperor Venture is a good and reasonable monarch,\" Sazed said.\nQuellion snorted, turning to one of his companions.

He had many of these—perhaps twenty—and\nSazed assumed they were members of his government. Most wore red, like Quellion, though their\nclothing hadn't been dyed as deeply.\n\"Elend Venture,\" Quellion said, raising a finger, turning back to Sazed, \"is a liar and a tyrant.\"\n\"That isn't true.\"\n\"Oh?\" Quellion asked. \"And how did he gain his throne? By defeating Straff Venture and Ashweather\nCett in war?\"\n\"War was—\"\n\"War is often the excuse of tyrants, Terrisman,\" Quellion said. \"My reports said that his Mistborn wife\nforced the kings to kneel before him that day—forced them to swear their loyalty to him or be\nslaughtered by his koloss brutes. Does that sound like the actions of a 'good and reasonable' man?\"\nSazed didn't respond.\nQuellion stepped forward, laying both hands palm-down on the top of his desk. \"Do you know what\nwe've done to the noblemen in this city, Terrisman?\"\n\"You've killed them,\" Sazed said quietly.\n\"Just as the Survivor ordered,\" Quellion said. \"You claim to have been his companion, before the fall.\nYet, you serve one of the very noble houses he sought to overthrow. Doesn't that strike you as\ninconsistent, Terrisman?\"\n\"Lord Kelsier accomplished his purpose in the death of the Lord Ruler,\" Sazed said. \"Once that was\nachieved, peace—\"\n\"Peace?\" Quellion asked. \"Tell me, Terrisman. Did you ever hear the Survivor speak of peace?\"\nSazed hesitated. \"No,\" he admitted.\nQuellion snorted. \"At least you're honest. The only reason I'm talking to you is because Venture was\nclever enough to send a Terrisman. If he'd sent a nobleman, I would have killed the cur and sent his\nblackened skull back as an answer.\"\nThe room fell silent. Tense. After a few moments of waiting, Quellion turned his back on Sazed, facing\nhis companions. \"You sense that?\" he asked his men. \"Can you feel yourselves begin to feel ashamed?\nLook at your emotions—do you suddenly feel a fellowship with these servants of a liar?\"\nHe turned back, glancing at Breeze. \"I've warned you all of Allomancy, the black tool of the nobility.\nWell, now you get to feel it. That man—sitting beside our distinguished Terrisman—is known as\nBreeze. He's one of the world's most vile men. A Soother of no small skill.\"\nQuellion turned to address Breeze. \"Tell me, Soother. How many friends have your magics made for\nyou? How many enemies have you forced to kill themselves? That pretty girl beside you—did you use\nyour arts to hex her into your bed?\"\nBreeze smiled, raising his cup of wine. \"My dear man, you have, of course, found me out. However,\ninstead of congratulating yourself for noticing my touch, perhaps you should ask yourself why I\nmanipulated you into saying what you just did.\""

Sazed sighed. An indignant reaction would\nhave been far more appropriate—but, then, that wasn't Breeze's way. Now the Citizen would spend the\nrest of the meeting wondering if his words were being guided by Breeze.\n\"Master Quellion,\" Sazed said, \"these are dangerous times. Surely you have noticed that.\"\n\"We can protect ourselves well enough,\" Quellion said.\n\"I'm not speaking of armies or bandits, Citizen. I'm speaking of mists and ash. Have you noticed that\nthe mists are lingering longer and longer during the daylight hours? Have you noticed them doing strange\nthings to your people, causing the deaths of some who go out?\"\nQuellion did not contradict him or call his words foolish. That told Sazed enough. People had died in\nthis city.\n\"The ash falls perpetually, Citizen,\" Sazed said. \"The mists are deadly, and the koloss run free. This\nwould be a very good time to have powerful alliances. In the Central Dominance, we can grow better\ncrops, for we get more sunlight. Emperor Venture has discovered a method of controlling the koloss.\nWhatever is to come in the next few years, it would be very advantageous to be Emperor Venture's\nfriend.\"\nQuellion shook his head, as if in resignation. He turned to his companions again. \"You see—just as I\ntold you. First, he tells us he comes in peace, then he moves on to threats. Venture controls the koloss.\nVenture controls the food. Next he'll be saying that Venture controls the mists!\" Quellion turned back to\nSazed. \"We don't have any use for threats here, Terrisman. We aren't worried about our future.\"\nSazed raised an eyebrow. \"And why is that?\"\n\"Because we follow the Survivor,\" Quellion said. \"Be gone from my sight.\"\nSazed stood. \"I would like to stay in the city and perhaps meet with you again.\"\n\"That meeting will not happen.\"\n\"Regardless,\" Sazed said. \"I would prefer to stay. You have my promise that my men will not cause\ntrouble. Might I have your leave?\" He bowed his head in deference.\nQuellion muttered something under his breath before waving a hand at him. \"If I forbid you, then you'll\njust sneak in. Stay if you must, Terrisman, but I warn you—follow our laws and do not make trouble.\"\nSazed bowed further, then retreated with his people.\n\"Well,\" Breeze said, settling back into the carriage, \"murderous revolutionaries, everybody wearing the\nsame gray clothing, ditch-like streets where every tenth building has been burned to the ground. This is a\nlovely place Elend chose for us to visit—remind me to thank him upon our return.\"\nSazed smiled, though he felt little humor.\n\"Oh, don't look so grim, old man,\" Breeze said, waving with his cane as the carriage began to roll, their\nsoldiers surrounding it. \"Something tells me that Quellion there isn't half as threatening as his bearing\nimplies. We'll convince him eventually.\""

This place . . . it's different from the other cities we've visited. The\nleaders aren't as desperate, and the people are more subservient. We won't have an easy time of it here,\nI think.\"\nAllrianne poked Breeze's arm. \"Breezy, do you see that, over there?\"\nBreeze squinted against the light, and Sazed leaned forward, glancing out the side of the carriage. A\ngroup of people had created a bonfire in the courtyard. The massive blaze sent a twisting line of smoke\ninto the air. Sazed reflexively looked for a tinmind to draw upon and enhance his vision. He shoved the\nimpulse aside, instead squinting against the afternoon light.\n\"It looks like . . .\"\n\"Tapestries,\" said one of their soldiers, marching at the side of the carriage. \"And furniture—rich things\nthat are signs of the nobility, according to the Citizen. The burning was staged for your benefit, of course.\nQuellion probably keeps storehouses of the stuff so that he can order them burned at dramatically\nappropriate times.\"\nSazed froze. The soldier was remarkably well informed. Sazed looked closely, suspicious. Like all of\ntheir men, this one wore his cloak hood up against the falling ash. As the man turned his head, Sazed\ncould see that—oddly—he wore a thick bandage tied across his eyes, as if he were blind. Despite that,\nSazed recognized the face.\n\"Spook, my dear boy!\" Breeze exclaimed. \"I knew you'd turn up eventually. Why the blindfold?\"\nSpook didn't answer the question. Instead, he turned, glancing back at the burning flames of the\nbonfire. There seemed a . . . tension to his posture.\nThe cloth must be thin enough to see through, Sazed thought. That was the only explanation for the\nway Spook moved with ease and grace, despite the cloth. Though, it certainly seemed thick enough to be\nobscuring. . . .\nSpook turned back to Sazed. \"You're going to need a base of operations in the city. Have you chosen\none yet?\"\nBreeze shook his head. \"We were thinking of using an inn.\"\n\"There aren't any true inns in the city,\" Spook said. \"Quellion says that citizens should care for one\nanother, letting visitors stay in each other's homes.\"\n\"Hmm,\" Breeze said. \"Perhaps we'll need to camp outside.\"\nSpook shook his head. \"No. Follow me.\"\n\"The Ministry Canton of Inquisition?\" Sazed asked, frowning as he climbed out of the carriage.\nSpook stood ahead of them, on the steps leading into the grand building. He turned, nodding his\nstrange, cloth-wrapped head. \"Quellion hasn't touched any of the Ministry buildings. He ordered them\nboarded up, but he didn't ransack or burn them. I think he's afraid of Inquisitors.\"\n\"A healthy and rational fear, my boy,\" Breeze said, still sitting inside the carriage.\nSpook snorted. \"The Inquisitors aren't going to bother us, Breeze. They're far too busy trying to kill\nVin. Come on.\""

Behind, he could hear Breeze sigh with an exaggerated\nsound, then call for one of the soldiers to bring a parasol against the ash.\nThe building was broad and imposing, like most Ministry offices. During the days of the Lord Ruler,\nthese buildings had stood as reminders of imperial might in every city across the Final Empire. The priests\nwho had filled them had mostly been bureaucrats and clerks—but, then, that had been the real power of\nthe Final Empire. Its control of resources and management of people.\nSpook stood beside the building's broad, boarded-up doors. Like most structures in Urteau, it was\nbuilt of wood, rather than stone. He stared up, as if watching the falling ash, as he waited for Sazed and\nBreeze. He had always been a quiet one, even more so since his uncle's death during the assault on\nLuthadel. As Sazed arrived, Spook began to rip boards free from the front of the building. \"I'm glad\nyou're here, Sazed,\" he said.\nSazed moved to help pull off boards. He heaved, trying to get the nails undone—yet, he must have\nchosen one of the more stubborn boards, for though the ones Spook grabbed came free with ease,\nSazed's refused to even budge. \"And why is it you're glad I am here, Lord Spook?\"\nSpook snorted. \"I'm no lord, Saze. Never did get Elend to give me a title.\"\nSazed smiled. \"He said that you only wanted one to impress women.\"\n\"Of course I did,\" Spook said, smiling as he ripped free another board. \"What other reason would\nthere be to have a title? Anyway, please just call me Spook. It's a good name.\"\n\"Very well.\"\nSpook reached over, using a single, casual hand to pull off the board Sazed had tried to budge.\nWhat? Sazed thought with shock. Sazed was by no means muscular—but, then, he hadn't thought that\nSpook was either. The lad must have been practicing with weights.\n\"Anyway,\" Spook said, turning, \"I'm glad you're here, because I have things to discuss with you.\nThings that others might not understand.\"\nSazed frowned. \"Things of what nature?\"\nSpook smiled, then threw his shoulder against the door, opening it into a dark, cavernous chamber.\n\"Things of gods and men, Sazed. Come on.\"\nThe boy disappeared into the darkness. Sazed waited outside, but Spook never lit a lantern. He could\nhear the young man moving around inside.\n\"Spook?\" he finally called out. \"I can't see in there. Do you have a lantern?\"\nThere was a pause. \"Oh,\" Spook's voice said. \"Right.\" A moment later, a light sparked, and a lantern\nbegan to glow.\nBreeze sauntered up behind Sazed. \"Tell me, Sazed,\" he said quietly, \"is it me, or has that boy changed\nsince we last saw him?\"\n\"He seems far more self-confident,\" Sazed said, nodding to himself. \"More capable as well.

But, what\ndo you suppose is the purpose of that blindfold?\"\nBreeze shrugged, taking Allrianne's arm. \"He always was an odd one. Perhaps he thinks it will disguise\nhim and help keep him from being recognized as a member of Kelsier's crew. Considering the\nimprovement in the boy's disposition—and diction—I'm willing to deal with a quirk or two.\"\nBreeze and Allrianne entered the building, and Sazed waved to Captain Goradel, indicating that he\nshould make a perimeter outside. The man nodded, sending a squad of soldiers up to follow Sazed and\nthe others. Finally, Sazed frowned to himself and entered the building.\nHe wasn't certain what he had been expecting. The building had been part of the Canton of\nInquisition—the most infamous of the Ministry's arms. It wasn't a place Sazed relished entering. The last\nbuilding like this he'd entered had been the Conventical of Seran, and it had been decidedly eerie. This\nbuilding, however, proved to be nothing like the Conventical—it was just another bureaucratic office. It\nwas furnished a little more austerely than most Ministry buildings, true, but it still had tapestries on the\nwooden walls and broad red rugs on the floor. The trim was of metal, and there were hearths in every\nroom.\nAs Sazed followed Breeze and Spook through the building, he was able to imagine what the building\nhad been like during the days of the Lord Ruler. There would have been no dust, then, but instead an air\nof crisp efficiency. Administrators would have sat at those desks, collecting and filing information about\nnoble houses, skaa rebels, and even other Ministry Cantons. There had been a longstanding feud\nbetween the Canton of Orthodoxy, which had administered the Lord Ruler's empire, and the Canton of\nInquisition, which had policed it.\nThis was not a place of fear at all, but rather a place of ledgers and files. The Inquisitors had probably\nvisited this building only rarely. Spook led them through several cluttered rooms toward a smaller storage\nchamber at the back. Here, Sazed could see that the dust on the floor had been disturbed.\n\"You've been here before?\" he asked, entering the room after Spook, Breeze, and Allrianne.\nSpook nodded. \"As has Vin. Don't you remember the report?\" With that, he felt about on the floor,\neventually finding a hidden latch and opening a trapdoor. Sazed peered down into the dark cavern\nbelow.\n\"What's he talking about?\" Allrianne whispered to Breeze. \"Vin's been here?\"\n\"She did reconnaissance in this city, dear,\" Breeze said. \"To find . . .\"\n\"The cache,\" Sazed said as Spook began to climb down a ladder into the darkness. He left the lantern\nbehind. \"The supply cache left behind by the Lord Ruler. All of them are underneath Ministry buildings.\"\n\"Well, that's what we're here to recover, isn't it?\" Allrianne asked. \"So, we've got it.

We can't have one of our major cities in revolt, and we particularly can't afford to let the\nrebellion spread. I must say, though, it does feel odd to be on this side of the problem—stopping a\nrebellion, rather than starting one.\"\n\"We may have to organize a rebellion against the rebellion, Breeze,\" Spook's voice echoed from\nbelow. \"If that makes you feel any more comfortable. Anyway, are you three coming down or not?\"\nSazed and Breeze shared a look, then Breeze gestured toward the dark pit. \"After you.\"\nSazed picked up the lantern and climbed down the ladder. At the bottom, he found a small stone\nchamber, one wall of which had been pulled back to reveal a cavern. He stepped inside, Breeze reaching\nthe ground behind him, then helping Allrianne down.\nSazed raised the lantern, staring quietly.\n\"Lord Ruler!\" Breeze said, stepping up beside him. \"It's enormous!\"\n\"The Lord Ruler prepared these caches in case of a disaster,\" Spook said, standing ahead of them in\nthe cavern. \"They were meant to help the empire through what we're now facing. They wouldn't be much\ngood if they weren't created on a grand scale.\"\n\"Grand\" was correct. They stood on a ledge near the ceiling of the cavern, and a vast chamber\nextended out below. Sazed could see row upon row of shelves lining the cavern floor.\n\"I think we should set up our base here, Sazed,\" Spook said, moving toward stairs that led down to\nthe cavern floor. \"It's the only defensible place in the city. If we move our troops into the building above,\nwe can use this cavern for supplies—and can even fall back in here in an emergency. We could defend\nthis even against a determined assault.\"\nSazed turned, regarding the stone doorway into the chamber. It was small enough that only one man\ncould pass through at a time—which meant that it would be very easy to guard. And, there was probably\na way to shut it again.\n\"Suddenly I feel a whole lot safer in this city,\" Breeze noted.\nSazed nodded. He turned, regarding the cavern again. In the distance, he could hear something. \"Is\nthat water?\"\nSpook was moving down steps. Again, his voice echoed hauntingly in the chamber. \"Each cache has a\nspecialty—something it contains more of than all the others.\"\nSazed moved down the steps as Goradel's soldiers entered the chamber behind Breeze. Though the\nsoldiers had brought more lanterns, Breeze and Allrianne stuck close to Sazed as they descended.\nSoon, Sazed realized he could see something sparkling in the distance. He held the lantern high,\npausing on the steps as he saw that some of the darkness in the distance was too flat to be part of the\ncavern floor.\nBreeze whistled quietly as they studied the enormous underground lake. \"Well,\" he noted, \"I guess\nnow we know where all the water from those canals went.\""

Yet,\nnow that we know that Rashek was himself a Terrisman, his destruction of that religion seems\nodd. I suspect it had something to do with the prophecies about the Hero of Ages. Rashek knew\nthat Preservation's power would eventually return to the Well of Ascension. If the Terris religion\nhad been allowed to survive, then perhaps—someday—a person would find their way to the Well\nand take up the power, then use it to defeat Rashek and overthrow his empire. So, he obscured\nknowledge of the Hero and what he was supposed to do, hoping to keep the secret of the Well to\nhimself.\n30\n\"YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TRY AND TALK me out of this?\" Elend asked, amused.\nHam and Cett shared a look.\n\"Why would we do that, El?\" Ham asked, standing at the front of the boat. In the distance, the sun\nwas setting, and the mists had already begun to gather. The boat rocked quietly, and soldiers milled\nabout on the shore, preparing for night. One week had passed since Vin's initial scouting of Fadrex, and\nshe still hadn't managed to sneak into the storage cache.\nThe night of the next ball had arrived, and Elend and Vin were planning to attend.\n\"Well, I can think of a couple of reasons why you might object,\" Elend said, counting them off on his\nfingers. \"First, it isn't wise to expose me to potential capture. Second, by revealing myself at the party, I'll\nshow that I'm Mistborn, confirming rumors that Yomen may not believe. Third, I'll be putting both of our\nMistborn in the same place, where they can be easily attacked—that can't be a good idea. Finally, there's\nthe fact that going to a ball in the middle of a war is just plain crazy.\"\nHam shrugged, leaning with one elbow against the deck railing. \"This isn't so different from when you\nentered your father's camp during the siege of Luthadel. Except you weren't Mistborn then, and you\nweren't in such a position of political power. Yomen would be crazy to make a move against you—he\nhas to know that if you're in the same room with him, he's in mortal danger himself.\"\n\"He'll run,\" Cett said from his seat. \"This party will end the moment you arrive.\"\n\"No,\" Elend said, \"I don't think it will.\" He glanced back toward their cabin. Vin was still getting\nready—she'd had the camp tailors modify one of the cooking girls' dresses. Elend was worried. No\nmatter how good the dress turned out to be, it would look out of place compared to the lavish ball\ngowns.\nHe turned back to Cett and Ham. \"I don't think Yomen will run. He has to know that if Vin wanted to\nkill him, she'd attack his palace in secret. He's trying very hard to pretend that nothing has changed since\nthe Lord Ruler disappeared. When we show up at the ball, it will make him think that we're willing to"

When we show up at the ball, it will make him think that we're willing to\npretend with him. He'll stay and see if he can gain some advantage by meeting with us on his terms.\"\n\"The man's a fool,\" Cett said. \"I can't believe he'd want to go back to the way things were.\"\n\"At least he's trying to give his subjects what they want. That's where you went wrong, Cett. You lost\nyour kingdom the moment you left because you didn't care to try pleasing anyone.\"\n\"A king doesn't have to please anyone,\" Cett snapped. \"He's the one with the army—that means other\npeople have to please him.\"\n\"Actually,\" Ham said, rubbing his chin, \"that theory can't be true. A king has to please\nsomebody—after all, even if he intended to force everyone to do what he said, he'd still have to at least\nplease his army. But then, I guess if the army is pleased simply by being allowed to push people around,\nyou might have an argument . . .\"\nHam trailed off, looking thoughtful, and Cett scowled. \"Does everything have to be some damn logic\npuzzle to you?\" he demanded. Ham just continued to rub his chin.\nElend smiled, glancing at his cabin again. It was good to hear Ham acting like himself. Cett protested\nHam's comments almost as much as Breeze did. In fact . . . Maybe that's why Ham hasn't been quite\nso prone to his little logic puzzles lately, Elend thought. There hasn't been anyone around to\ncomplain about them.\n\"So, Elend . . .\" Cett said. \"If you die, I'm in charge, right?\"\n\"Vin will take command if something happens to me,\" Elend said. \"You know that.\"\n\"Right,\" Cett said. \"And if both of you die?\"\n\"Sazed is next in the imperial succession after Vin, Cett. We've discussed that.\"\n\"Yes, but what about this army?\" Cett said. \"Sazed is off in Urteau. Who leads these men until we\nmeet up with him?\"\nElend sighed. \"If, somehow, Yomen manages to kill both Vin and myself, then I suggest that you\nrun—because yes, you'd be in charge here, and the Mistborn who killed us is likely to come for you\nnext.\"\nCett smiled in satisfaction, though Ham frowned at this.\n\"You've never wanted titles, Ham,\" Elend pointed out. \"And you've chafed at every leadership position\nI've given you.\"\n\"I know,\" he said. \"But what about Demoux?\"\n\"Cett has more experience,\" Elend said. \"He's a better man than he pretends, Ham. I trust him. That\nwill have to be enough for you. Cett, if things turn bad, I charge you with returning to Luthadel and\nsearching out Sazed to tell him that he's emperor. Now, I think that—\"\nElend paused as the door to his cabin opened. He turned, putting on his best consoling smile, then\nfroze.\nVin stood in the doorway wearing a stunning black gown with silver trim, cut after a modern fashion."

He turned, putting on his best consoling smile, then\nfroze.\nVin stood in the doorway wearing a stunning black gown with silver trim, cut after a modern fashion.\nSomehow, it managed to look sleek despite the bell-shaped skirt, which fanned out with petticoats. Her\npure black hair, which she often wore pulled back in a tail, was down, and it now reached to her\ncollarbone, neatly trimmed and curling just slightly. The only jewelry she wore was her simple earring, the\none she'd gotten from her mother when she was just a child.\nHe always thought she was beautiful. And yet . . . how long had it been since he'd seen her in a gown,\nwith her hair and makeup done? He tried to say something, give her a compliment, but his voice just kind\nof trailed off.\nShe walked over on light feet, kissing him briefly. \"I'll take that as an indication that I managed to put\nthis thing on right. I'd forgotten what a pain gowns could be. And the makeup! Honestly, Elend, you're\nnever allowed to complain about those suits of yours again.\"\nBeside them, Ham was chuckling. Vin turned. \"What?\"\n\"Ah, Vin,\" Ham said, leaning back and folding his muscular arms, \"when did you go and grow up on\nme? It seems like just last week you were scrambling about, hiding in corners, wearing the haircut of a\nboy and the attitude of a mouse.\"\nVin smiled fondly. \"Do you remember when we first met? You thought I was a twixt.\"\nHam nodded. \"Breeze nearly fainted dead away when he found we'd been talking with a Mistborn all\nthat time! Honestly, Vin. Sometimes I can't believe that you were that same frightened girl Kelsier\nbrought into the crew.\"\n\"It has been five years, Ham. I'm twenty-one now.\"\n\"I know,\" Ham said, sighing. \"You're like my own children, adults before I had time to know them as\nkids. In fact, I probably know you and El better than I know any of them . . .\"\n\"You'll get back to them, Ham,\" Vin said, reaching over and laying a hand on his shoulder. \"Once this\nis all over.\"\n\"Oh, I know that,\" he said, smiling, ever the optimist. \"But, you can never have back what you've\nmissed. I hope all this turns out to be worth it.\"\nElend shook his head, finally finding his voice. \"I have only one thing to say. If that dress is what the\ncooking girls are wearing, I'm paying them far too much.\"\nVin laughed.\n\"Seriously, Vin,\" Elend said. \"The army's tailors are good, but there's no way that dress came from\nmaterials we had in camp. Where did you get it?\"\n\"It's a mystery,\" Vin said, narrowing her eyes and smiling. \"We Mistborn are incredibly mysterious.\"\nElend paused. \"Um . . . I'm Mistborn too, Vin. That doesn't make any sense.\"\n\"We Mistborn need not make sense,\" Vin said. \"It's beneath us. Come on—the sun's already down.\nWe need to get moving.\"\n\"Have fun dancing with our enemies,\" Ham said as Vin hopped from the boat, then Pushed herself up"

Elend waved farewell, Pushing himself into the air as well. As he shot away, his\ntin-enhanced ears heard Ham's voice talking to Cett.\n\"So . . . you can't go anywhere unless someone carries you, right?\" the Thug asked.\nCett grunted.\n\"Well then,\" Ham said, sounding very pleased. \"I've got quite a number of philosophical puzzles you\nmight enjoy. . . .\"\nAllomantic jumping was not easy when one was wearing a ball gown. Every time Vin started to descend,\nthe bottom of the dress flared up around her, ruffling and flapping like a flock of startled birds.\nVin wasn't particularly worried about showing off what was under the dress. Not only was it too dark\nfor most people to see, but she wore leggings beneath the petticoats. Unfortunately, flapping\ndresses—and the drag they created in the air—made steering a jump much more difficult. They also\nmade a lot of noise. She wondered what the guards thought as she passed over the rocky shelves that\nwere the natural city walls. To her ear, she sounded like a dozen waving flags, beating against themselves\nin the middle of a windstorm.\nShe finally slowed, aiming for a rooftop that had been cleared of ash. She hit lightly, bouncing up and\nspinning, dress flaring, before landing and waiting for Elend. He followed, landing less smoothly with a\nhard thump and a grunt. It wasn't that he was bad at Pushing and Pulling—he just hadn't had as much\npractice as Vin. She'd probably been much like him during her first years as an Allomancer.\nWell . . . maybe not like him, she thought fondly as Elend dusted himself off. But, I'm sure a lot of\nother Allomancers were about at Elend's level after only a year of practice.\n\"That was quite the series of jumps, Vin,\" Elend said, puffing slightly as he glanced back toward the\ncliff-like rock formations, their fires burning high in the night. Elend wore his standard white military\nuniform, one of the same ones that Tindwyl had designed for him. He'd had this one scrubbed free of ash,\nand he'd gotten his beard trimmed.\n\"I couldn't land often,\" Vin explained. \"These white petticoats will stain with ash easily. Come on—we\nneed to get inside.\"\nElend turned, smiling in the darkness. He actually looked excited. \"The dress. You paid a dressmaker\ninside the city to make it for you?\"\n\"Actually, I paid a friend inside the city to have it made for me, and to get me the makeup.\" She\njumped away, heading toward Keep Orielle—which, according to Slowswift, was the site of the\nevening's ball. She kept to the air, never landing. Elend followed behind, using the same coins.\nSoon, they approached a burst of color in the mists, like an aurora from one of Sazed's stories. The\nbubble of light turned into the massive keep she had seen during her previous infiltration, its stained-glass\nwindows shining from the inside.

Vin angled herself downward, streaking through the mists. She briefly\nconsidered dropping to the ground out in the courtyard—away from watchful eyes—so that she and\nElend could approach the doors subtly. Then she decided against it.\nThis wasn't an evening for subtlety.\nSo, instead she dropped directly down onto the carpeted steps leading up to the main entrance of the\ncastle-like building. Her landing blew away flakes of ash, creating a little pocket of cleanliness. Elend\nlanded beside her a second later, then stood up straight, his brilliant white cape flapping around him. At\nthe top of the steps, a pair of uniformed servants had been greeting guests and ushering them into the\nbuilding. Both men froze, stunned expressions on their faces.\nElend held out his arm to Vin. \"Shall we?\"\nVin took the arm. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Preferably before those men can get the guards.\"\nThey strode up the steps, sounds of surprise coming from behind, where a small group of noblemen\nhad been exiting their carriage. Ahead, one of the servants moved forward and cut off Vin and Elend.\nElend carefully placed a hand against the man's chest, then shoved him aside with a pewter-fueled push.\nThe man stumbled backward into the wall. The other one went running for the guards.\nInside the antechamber, waiting nobility began to whisper and question. Vin heard them asking if\nanyone recognized these strange newcomers, one in black, the other in white. Elend strode forward\nfirmly, Vin at his side, causing people to stumble over themselves and move out of the way. Elend and\nVin passed quickly through the small room, and Elend handed a name card to a servant who waited to\nannounce arrivals into the ballroom proper.\nThey waited on the servant, and Vin realized that she'd begun holding her breath. It seemed as if she\nwere reliving a dream—or was it a fond memory? For a moment, she was that same young girl of over\nfour years before, arriving at Keep Venture for her very first ball, nervous and worried that she wouldn't\nbe able to play her part.\nYet, she felt none of that same insecurity. She didn't worry if she'd find acceptance or belief. She'd\nslain the Lord Ruler. She'd married Elend Venture. And—more remarkable than either\naccomplishment—somehow in the chaos and mess she'd discovered who she was. Not a girl of the\nstreets, though that was where she'd been raised. Not a woman of the court, though she appreciated the\nbeauty and grace of the balls. Someone else.\nSomeone she liked.\nThe servant reread Elend's card, growing pale. He looked up. Elend met the man's eyes, then gave a\nsmall nod, as if to say, \"Yes, I'm afraid that it's true.\"\nThe servant cleared his throat, and Elend led Vin into the ballroom.\n\"High Emperor, Lord Elend Venture,\" the servant announced in a clear voice. \"And the Empress Vin\nVenture, Heir of the Survivor, Hero of Ages.\"\nThe entire ballroom grew suddenly—and unnaturally—quiet.

        "text": "Venture, Heir of the Survivor, Hero of Ages.\"\nThe entire ballroom grew suddenly—and unnaturally—quiet. Vin and Elend paused at the front of the\nroom, giving the gathered nobility a chance to see them. It appeared that Keep Orielle's grand main hall,\nlike Keep Venture's, was also its ballroom. However, instead of being tall with a broad, arched roof, this\nroom had a relatively low ceiling and small, intricate designs in the stonework. It was as if the architect\nhad tried for beauty on a delicate scale, rather than an imposing one.\nThe entire chamber was crafted from white marble of various shades. While it was large enough to\nhold hundreds of people—plus a dance floor and tables—it still felt intimate. The room was divided by\nrows of ornamental marble pillars, and it was further partitioned with large stained-glass panels that ran\nfrom floor to ceiling. Vin was impressed—most keeps in Luthadel left their stained glass to the perimeter\nwalls, so they could be lit from outside. While this keep did have some of those, she quickly realized that\nthe true masterpieces had been placed here, freestanding inside the ballroom, where they could be\nadmired from both sides.\n\"By the Lord Ruler,\" Elend whispered, scanning the gathered people. \"They really do think they can\njust ignore the rest of the world, don't they?\"\nGold, silver, bronze, and brass sparkled upon figures in brilliant ball gowns and sharp gentlemen's\nsuits. The men generally wore dark clothing, and the women generally wore colors. A group of musicians\nplayed strings in a far corner, their music unimpeded by the shocked atmosphere. Servants waited,\nuncertain, bearing drinks and foods.\n\"Yes,\" Vin whispered. \"We should move out of the doorway. When the guards come, we'll want to be\nmingled in the crowd to make the soldiers uncertain if they want to attack.\"\nElend smiled, and she knew he was remarking to himself about her tendency to keep her back from\nbeing exposed. However, she also knew that he realized she was right. They walked down the short set\nof marble steps, joining the party.\nSkaa might have shied away from such a dangerous couple, but Vin and Elend wore the costume of\nnoble propriety. The aristocracy of the Final Empire were quite adept at playing pretend—and when they\nwere uncertain how to behave, they fell back on the old standard: proper manners.\nLords and ladies bowed and curtsied, acting as if the emperor and empress's attendance had been\ncompletely expected. Vin let Elend take the lead, as he had far more experience than she with matters of\ncourt. He nodded to those they passed, displaying just the right amount of self-assurance. Behind, guards\nfinally arrived at the doors. They stopped, however, obviously wary about disturbing the party.\n\"There,\" Vin said, nodding to their left. Through a stained-glass partition, she could make out a figure\nsitting at an elevated table.\n\"I see him,\" Elend said, leading her around the glass, and giving Vin her first sight of Aradan Yomen,\nking of the Western Dominance.\nHe was younger than she'd expected—perhaps as young as Elend. Round-faced with serious eyes,\nYomen had his head shaved bald, after the manner of obligators. His dark gray robes were a mark of his"

        "text": "He was younger than she'd expected—perhaps as young as Elend. Round-faced with serious eyes,\nYomen had his head shaved bald, after the manner of obligators. His dark gray robes were a mark of his\nstation, as were the complicated patterns of tattoos around his eyes, which proclaimed him a very\nhigh-ranking member of the Canton of Resource.\nYomen stood up as Vin and Elend approached. He looked utterly dumbfounded. Behind, the soldiers\nhad begun to carefully work their way into the room. Elend paused a distance from the high table, with its\nwhite cloth and pure crystal place settings. He met Yomen's gaze, the other guests so quiet that Vin\nguessed most were holding their breaths.\nVin checked her metal reserves, turning slightly, keeping an eye on the guards. Then, from the corner\nof her eye, she saw Yomen raise his hand and subtly wave the guards back.\nChatter began in the room almost immediately. Yomen sat back down, looking troubled, and did not\nreturn to his meal.\nVin looked up at Elend. \"Well,\" she whispered, \"we're in. What now?\"\n\"I need to talk to Yomen,\" Elend said. \"But I'd like to wait a little bit first; give him a chance to get\nused to our presence.\"\n\"Then we should mingle.\"\n\"Split up? We can cover more nobility that way.\"\nVin hesitated.\n\"I can protect myself, Vin,\" Elend said, smiling. \"I promise.\"\n\"All right.\" Vin nodded, though that wasn't the only reason she'd paused.\n\"Talk to as many people as you can,\" Elend said. \"We're here to shatter this people's image of safety.\nAfter all, we just proved that Yomen can't keep us out of Fadrex—and we're showing that we're so\nunthreatened by him that we'll waltz into a ball that he's attending. Once we've made a bit of a stir, I'll talk\nto their king, and they'll all be certain to listen in.\"\nVin nodded. \"When you mingle, watch for people who look like they might be willing to support us\nagainst the current government. Slowswift implied that there are some in the city who aren't pleased with\nthe way their king is handling things.\"\nElend nodded, kissed her cheek, and then she was alone. Vin stood in her beautiful gown, feeling a\nmoment of shock. Over the last two years, she'd explicitly worked to keep herself out of situations where\nshe would wear gowns and mingle with nobility. She'd determinedly worn trousers and shirts, making it\nher self-appointed duty to sow discomfort in those she found too full of themselves.\nYet, she had been the one to suggest this infiltration to Elend. Why? Why put herself back in this\nposition? She wasn't displeased with who she was—she didn't need to prove anything by putting on\nanother silly gown and making courtly conversation with a bunch of nobility she didn't know.\nDid she?\nNo use fidgeting about it now, Vin thought, scanning the crowd. Noble balls in Luthadel—and she\ncould only assume here—were very polite affairs, designed to encourage mingling, and therefore facilitate\npolitical give and take. Balls had once been the main form of sport for the nobility, who had lived\nprivileged lives under the Lord Ruler because their ancestors had been his friends back before his\nAscension."

Balls had once been the main form of sport for the nobility, who had lived\nprivileged lives under the Lord Ruler because their ancestors had been his friends back before his\nAscension.\nAnd so, the party was made up of small groups—some mixed couples, but many clusters of just\nwomen or just men. A pair was not expected to stay together the entire time. There were side rooms\nwhere gentlemen could retire and drink with their allies, leaving the women to converse in the ballroom.\nVin walked forward, slipping a cup of wine off the tray of a passing servant. By splitting up, Elend and\nshe had indicated that they were open to conversation with others. Unfortunately, it had been a long, long\ntime since Vin had to be alone at a party like this. She felt awkward, uncertain whether to approach one\nof the groups, or wait to see if anyone came to her. She felt somewhat as she had that first night, when\nshe'd gone to Keep Venture posing as a lone noblewoman, Sazed her only guide.\nThat day, she'd played a part, hiding in her role as Valette Renoux. She couldn't do that anymore.\nEveryone knew who she really was. That would have bothered her, once, but it didn't anymore. Still, she\ncouldn't just do what she'd done then—stand around and wait for others to come to her. The entire room\nseemed to be staring at her.\nShe strode through the beautiful white room, aware of how much her black dress stood out against the\nwomen in their colors. She moved around the slices of colored glass that hung from the ceiling like\ncrystalline curtains. She'd learned from her earlier balls that there was one thing she could always count\non: Whenever noblewomen gathered, one always set herself up as the most important.\nVin found her with ease. The woman had dark hair and tan skin, and she sat at a table surrounded by\nsycophants. Vin recognized that arrogant look, that way the woman's voice was just loud enough to be\nimperious, but just soft enough to make everyone hang on her words.\nVin approached with determination. Years ago, she'd been forced to start at the bottom. She didn't\nhave time for that. She didn't know the subtle political intricacies of the city—the allegiances and rivalries.\nHowever, there was one thing of which she was fairly confident.\nWhichever side this woman was on, Vin wanted to be on the opposite one.\nSeveral of the sycophants looked up as Vin approached, and they grew pale. Their leader had the\npoise to remain aloof. She'll try to ignore me, Vin thought. I can't leave her that option. Vin sat at the\ntable directly across from the woman. Then, Vin turned and addressed several of the younger\nsycophants.\n\"She's planning to betray you,\" Vin said.\nThe women glanced at each other.\n\"She has plans to get out of the city,\" Vin said. \"When the army attacks, she won't be here. And she's\ngoing to leave you all to die. Make an ally of me, however, and I will see that you are protected.\"\n\"Excuse me?\" the lead woman said, her voice indignant. \"Did I invite you to sit here?\"\nVin smiled. That was easy.

A thieving crewleader's basis of power was money—take that away, and\nhe'd fall. For a woman like this, her power was in the people who listened to her. To make her react, one\nsimply had to threaten to take her minions.\nVin turned to confront the woman. \"No, you didn't invite me. I invited myself. Someone needs to warn\nthe women here.\"\nThe woman sniffed. \"You spread lies. You know nothing of my supposed plans.\"\n\"Don't I? You're not the type to let a man like Yomen determine your future, and if the others here\nthink about it, they'll realized that there's no way you would let yourself get caught in Fadrex City without\nplans to escape. I'm surprised you're even still here.\"\n\"Your threats do not frighten me,\" the lady said.\n\"I haven't threatened you yet,\" Vin noted, sipping her wine. She gave a careful Push on the emotions of\nthe women at the table, making them more worried. \"We could get to that, if you wish—though,\ntechnically, I've got your entire city under threat already.\"\nThe woman narrowed her eyes at Vin. \"Don't listen to her, ladies.\"\n\"Yes, Lady Patresen,\" one of the women said, speaking a little too quickly.\nPatresen, Vin thought, relieved that someone had finally mentioned the woman's name. Do I know\nthat name? \"House Patresen,\" Vin said idly. \"Isn't that a cousin family of House Elariel?\"\nLady Patresen remained quiet.\n\"I killed an Elariel once,\" Vin said. \"It was a good fight. Shan was a very clever woman, and a skilled\nMistborn.\" She leaned in. \"You may think that the stories about me are exaggerations. You may assume\nthat I didn't really kill the Lord Ruler, and that the talk is simply propaganda crafted to help stabilize my\nhusband's rule.\n\"Think as you wish, Lady Patresen. However, there is one thing you must understand. You are not my\nadversary. I don't have time for people like you. You're a petty woman in an insignificant city, part of a\ndoomed culture of nobility. I'm not talking to you because I want to be part of your schemes; you can't\neven understand how unimportant they are to me. I'm just here to voice a warning. We're going to take\nthis city—and when we do, there will be little room for people who were against us.\"\nPatresen paled just slightly. However, her voice was calm when she spoke. \"I doubt that's true. If you\ncould take the city as easily as you claim, then you would have already.\"\n\"My husband is a man of honor,\" Vin said, \"and decided that he wished to speak with Yomen before\nattacking. I, however, am not quite so temperate.\"\n\"Well, I think that—\"\n\"You don't understand, do you?\" Vin asked. \"It doesn't matter what you think. Look, I know you're\nthe type with powerful connections. Those connections will have told you by now the numbers we bring.\nForty thousand men, twenty thousand koloss, and a full contingent of Allomancers. Plus two Mistborn."

I suggest you take it.\"\nShe punctuated her last comment with a powerful Soothing. She wanted it to be obvious to the\nwomen, to let them know that they were—indeed—under her power. Then, she stood, trailing away\nfrom the table.\nWhat she had said to Patresen wasn't really that important—the important thing was that Vin had been\nseen confronting the woman. Hopefully, that would put Vin on a side in the local politics, making her less\nthreatening to some factions in the room. That, in turn, would make her more accessible, and—\nThe sound of chairs scooting back from the table came from behind her. Vin turned, suspicious, and\nsaw most of Lady Patresen's clique approaching in a hurry, leaving their leader sitting virtually alone at\nher table, a scowl on her face.\nVin tensed.\n\"Lady Venture,\" one of the women said. \"Perhaps you would let some of us . . . introduce you at the\nparty?\"\nVin frowned.\n\"Please,\" the woman said very quietly.\nVin blinked in surprise. She'd expected the women to resent her, not listen to her.

The Citizen couldn't know about the cache,\notherwise he would have ransacked it. That meant Sazed and his team held a distinct advantage should\nevents in the city turn ugly.\nThey had pulled some of the furniture from the building above and arranged it—with sheets and\ntapestries to create \"rooms\"—amid the shelves in the cavern. Logic dictated that the cavern was the best\nplace to spend their time, for should someone attack the Ministry building, the cavern was where they\nwanted to be.

He'd\nturned aside all questions and promptings regarding why he wore it, though Sazed was beginning to\nsuspect it had to do with burning tin.\nSazed nodded at the young man's comment. \"The Lord Ruler wasn't worried about causing financial\nruin in Urteau—he just wanted to make certain this cavern had access to a constant, flowing source of\nfresh water.\"\n\"Isn't this all beside the point?\" Allrianne asked. \"So we have water. What about that maniac running\nthe city?\"\nSazed paused, and the others turned to look to him. I am, unfortunately, in charge. \"Well,\" he said,\n\"we should speak of this. Emperor Venture has asked us to secure the city. As the Citizen has proven\nunwilling to meet with us again, we shall need to discuss other options.\"\n\"That man needs to go,\" Spook said. \"We need assassins.\"\n\"I fear that wouldn't work very well, my dear boy,\" Breeze said.\n\"Why not?\" Spook asked. \"We killed the Lord Ruler, and that worked pretty well.\"\n\"Ah,\" Breeze said, raising a finger, \"but the Lord Ruler was irreplaceable. He was a god, and so killing\nhim created a psychological impact on his populace.\"\nAllrianne nodded. \"This Citizen's not a force of nature, but a man—and men can be replaced. If we\nassassinate Quellion, one of his lackeys will simply take his place.\"\n\"And we will be branded as murderers,\" Breeze added.\n\"What, then?\" Spook asked. \"We leave him alone?\"\n\"Of course not,\" Breeze said. \"If we want to take this city, we need to undermine him, then remove\nhim. We prove that his entire system is faulty—that his government is, in essence, silly. If we manage that,\nwe won't just stop him, we'll stop everyone who has worked with him and supported him. That is the\nonly way we're going to take Urteau short of marching an army in here and seizing it by force.\"\n\"And, since His Majesty kindly left us without any troops to speak of . . .\" Allrianne said.\n\"I am not convinced that such rash action is required,\" Sazed said. \"Perhaps, given more time, we'll be\nable to work with this man.\"\n\"Work with him?\" Spook asked. \"You've been here three days—isn't that enough for you to see\nwhat Quellion is like?\""

The Survivor spoke of killing the nobility—goodness knows, we all saw him\nengaging in that activity often enough. He spoke of revolution and of skaa ruling themselves.\"\n\"He spoke of extreme actions during extreme times,\" Breeze said. \"That's what you do when you need\nto motivate people. Even Kelsier wouldn't have taken it this far.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Sazed said. \"But can we really be surprised that people who heard Kelsier speak have\ncreated this society? And, what right have we to take it from them? In a way, they've been truer to\nKelsier than we have. Can you really say that you think he'd be pleased to find out that we put a\nnobleman on the throne not one day after he died?\"\nBreeze and Spook glanced at each other, and neither contradicted him.\n\"It's just not right,\" Spook finally said. \"These people claim to know Kelsier, but they don't. He didn't\nwant people to be grim and bullied—he wanted them to be free and happy.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Breeze said. \"Besides, we did choose to follow Elend Venture—and he's given us an order.\nOur empire needs these supplies, and we can't afford to let an organized rebellion seize and control one\nof the most important cities in the empire. We need to secure this cache and protect the people of\nUrteau. It's for the greater good, and all that!\"\nAllrianne nodded her agreement—and, as always, Sazed felt her touch on his emotions.\nFor the greater good . . . Sazed thought. He knew that Spook was right. Kelsier wouldn't want this\nwarped society being perpetuated in his name. Something needed to be done. \"Very well,\" he said.\n\"What should our course of action be?\"\n\"Nothing, for now,\" Breeze said. \"We need time to feel out the city's climate. How close are the\npeople to rebelling against dear Quellion? How active is the local criminal element? How corruptible are\nthe men who serve the new government? Give me some time to discover answers to these questions, and\nthen we can decide what to do.\"\n\"I still say we do it as Kelsier did,\" Spook said. \"Why can't we just topple the Citizen like he did the\nLord Ruler?\"\n\"I doubt that would work,\" Breeze said, sipping his wine.\n\"Why not?\" Spook asked.\n\"For a very simple reason, my dear boy,\" Breeze said. \"We don't have Kelsier anymore.\"\nSazed nodded.

It was a passion that had driven him, had helped him accomplish\nthe impossible. However, Sazed feared it would destroy those whom it had infected.\n\"Take the time you need, Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"Let me know when you think we are ready to take the\nnext step.\"\nBreeze nodded, and the meeting broke up. Sazed stood, sighing quietly. As he did, he met Breeze's\neyes, and the man winked at him with a smile that seemed to say, \"This won't be half as difficult as you\nthink.\" Sazed smiled back, and he felt Breeze's touch on his emotions, trying to encourage him.\nYet, the Soother's hand was too light. Breeze couldn't have known the conflict that still twisted inside\nof Sazed. A conflict about much more than Kelsier and the problems in Urteau. He was glad for a little\nbit of time to wait in the city, for he still had much work to do with the religions listed, one per sheet, in\nhis portfolio.\nEven that work was difficult for him to get to recently. He did his best to give the others leadership, as\nElend had asked. However, the pernicious darkness Sazed felt inside of him refused to be shaken away.\nIt was more dangerous to him, he knew, than anything else he had faced while serving with the crew,\nbecause it made him feel as if he didn't care.\nI must keep working, he decided, walking away from the meeting place, carefully sliding his portfolio\noff of a nearby shelf. I have to keep searching. I must not give up.\nIt was far more difficult than that, however. In the past, logic and thought had always been his refuge.\nHowever, his emotions didn't respond to logic. No amount of thinking about what he should be doing\ncould help him.\nHe ground his teeth, walking, hoping that the motion would help him work out the knots within himself.\nA part of him wanted to go out and study the new form of the Church of the Survivor that had sprung up\nhere in Urteau. However, that seemed like a waste of time. The world was ending, why study one more\nreligion? He already knew this one was false; he'd dismissed the Church of the Survivor early in his\nstudies. It was filled with more contradictions than almost any in his portfolio.\nMore filled with passion as well.\nAll the religions in his collection were alike in one respect; they had failed. The people who'd followed\nthem had died, been conquered, their religions stamped out. Was that not proof enough for him? He'd\ntried preaching them, but he'd very, very rarely had any success.\nIt was all meaningless. Everything was ending anyway.\nNo! Sazed thought. I will find the answers. The religions didn't disappear completely—the\nKeepers preserved them. There must be answers in one of them. Somewhere.\nEventually, he found his way to the wall of the cavern, which held the steel plate inscribed by the Lord\nRuler. They already had a record of what it said, of course, but Sazed wanted to see it and read it for\nhimself. He looked up at the metal, which reflected the light of a nearby lantern, reading the words of the"

He looked up at the metal, which reflected the light of a nearby lantern, reading the words of the\nvery man who had destroyed so many religions.\nThe plan, the words said, is simple. When the power returns to the Well, I will take it and make\ncertain the thing remains trapped.\nAnd still I worry. It has proven far more clever than I had assumed, infecting my thoughts,\nmaking me see and feel things I do not wish to. It is so subtle, so careful. I cannot see how it could\ncause my death, but still I worry.\nIf I am dead, then these caches will provide some measure of protection for my people. I fear\nwhat is coming. What might be. If you read this now, and I am gone, then I fear for you. Still, I\nwill try to leave what help I can.\nThere are metals of Allomancy which I have shared with none. If you are a priest of mine,\nworking this cavern and reading these words, know that you will incur my wrath if you share this\nknowledge. However, if it is true that the force has returned and I am unable to deal with it, then\nperhaps knowledge of electrum will give you some aid. My researchers have discovered that\nmixing an alloy of forty-five percent gold and fifty-five percent silver creates a new Allomantic\nmetal. Burning it will not give you the power of atium, but will provide some help against those\nwho themselves burn it.\nAnd that was it. Beside the words was a map, indicating the location of the next cache—the one in the\nsmall southern mining village that Vin and Elend had secured a short time back. Sazed read over the\nwords again, but they only served to enhance his sense of despair. Even the Lord Ruler seemed to feel\nhelpless in the face of their current predicament. He'd planned to be alive, he'd planned for none of this to\nhappen. But he'd known that his plans might not work.\nSazed turned, leaving the plate behind, walking to the bank of the underground lake. The water lay like\nblack glass, undisturbed by wind or ash, though it did ripple slightly from the current. A pair of lanterns\nsat by the edge of the water, burning quietly, marking the bank. Behind him, a short distance away, some\nof the soldiers had made camp—though a good two-thirds of them kept to the upstairs to make certain\nthe building had the look of being lived in. Others searched the cavern walls in hopes of finding a secret\nexit. They would all be a lot more comfortable within the cavern if they knew they had a means of\nescaping it, should they get attacked.\n\"Sazed.\"\nSazed turned, then nodded to Spook as the young man walked up to join him on the bank of the black\nstill water. They stood together quietly, contemplative.\nThis one has troubles of his own, Sazed thought, noting the way that Spook watched the waters.\nThen, surprisingly, Spook reached up and untied the cloth from his eyes. He pulled it free, revealing a\npair of spectacles underneath, perhaps used to keep the cloth from pressing his eyes closed. Spook\nremoved the spectacles and blinked, squinting. His eyes began to water, then he reached down and put\nout one of the two lanterns, leaving Sazed standing in very dim light. Spook sighed, standing and wiping\nhis eyes."

Sazed suspected that if he watched closely, he'd see\nthe boy put in earplugs as well. Curious.\n\"Sazed,\" Spook said, \"I wanted to talk to you about something.\"\n\"Please, speak as you wish.\"\n\"I . . .\" Spook trailed off, then glanced at Sazed. \"I think Kelsier is still with us.\"\nSazed frowned.\n\"Not alive, of course,\" Spook said quickly. \"But, I think he's watching over us. Protecting us . . . that\nsort of thing.\"\n\"That's a pleasant sentiment, I think,\" Sazed said. Completely false, of course.\n\"It's not just a sentiment,\" Spook replied. \"He's here. I was just wondering if there was anything in any\nof those religions you studied that talked about things like that.\"\n\"Of course,\" Sazed said. \"Many of them spoke of the dead remaining as spirits to help, or curse, the\nliving.\"\nThey fell silent, Spook obviously waiting for something.\n\"Well?\" Spook asked. \"Aren't you going to preach a religion to me?\"\n\"I don't do that anymore,\" Sazed said quietly.\n\"Oh,\" Spook said. \"Um, why not?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"I find it hard to preach to others that which has offered me no solace, Spook.\nI am looking through them, trying to discover which—if any of them—are right and true. Once I have that\nknowledge, I will be happy to share with you any that seem most likely to contain truth. For now,\nhowever, I believe none of them, and therefore will preach none of them.\"\nSurprisingly, Spook didn't argue with him. Sazed had found it frustrating that his friends—people who\nwere, for the most part, determined atheists—would grow so offended when he threatened to join them\nin their lack of belief. And yet, Spook didn't offer arguments.\n\"It makes sense,\" the young man finally said. \"Those religions aren't true. After all, Kelsier is the one\nwho watches over us, not those other gods.\"\nSazed closed his eyes. \"How can you say that, Spook? You lived with him—you knew him. We both\nknow that Kelsier was no god.\"\n\"The people of this city think he is.\"\n\"And where has it gotten them?\" Sazed asked. \"Their belief has brought oppression and violence.\nWhat is the good of faith if this is the result? A city full of people misinterpreting their god's commands?\nA world of ash and pain and death and sorrow?\" Sazed shook his head. \"That is why I no longer wear\nmy metalminds. Religions which cannot offer more than this do not deserve to be taught.\"\n\"Oh,\" Spook said. He knelt down, dipping a hand in the water, then shivered. \"That makes sense too,\nI guess—though I'd have guessed it was because of her.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Your woman,\" Spook said. \"The other Keeper—Tindwyl.

I'd have thought that maybe you wouldn't talk about religion anymore because that\nmight be what she'd have wanted.\"\nSazed felt a chill.\n\"Anyway,\" Spook said, standing, wiping off his hand, \"the people of this city know more than you\nthink they do. Kelsier is watching over us.\"\nWith that, the boy trailed away. Sazed, however, wasn't listening. He stood, staring at the ebony\nwaters.\nBecause that might be what she'd have wanted. . . .\nTindwyl had thought religion to be foolish. She had said that people who looked toward ancient\nprophecies or unseen forces were seeking excuses. During her last few weeks with Sazed, this had often\nbeen a topic of conversation—even slight contention—between the two of them, for their research had\ndealt with the prophecies regarding the Hero of Ages.\nThat research had turned out to be useless. At best, the prophecies were the vain hopes of men who\nwished for a better world. At worst, they had been cleverly placed to further the goals of a malignant\nforce. Either way, he had believed strongly in his work at that time. And Tindwyl had helped him. They\nhad searched through their metalminds, sifting through centuries of information, history, and mythology,\nseeking references to the Deepness, the Hero of Ages, and the Well of Ascension. She had worked with\nhim, claiming that her interest was academic, not religious. Sazed suspected that she'd had a different\nmotivation.\nShe'd wanted to be with him. She had suppressed her dislike of religion out of a desire to be involved\nwith what he found important. And, now that she was dead, Sazed found himself doing what she'd found\nimportant. Tindwyl had studied politics and leadership. She'd loved to read the biographies of great\nstatesmen and generals. Had he unconsciously agreed to become Elend's ambassador so that he could\ninvolve himself in Tindwyl's studies, just as she—before her death—had given herself over to his?\nHe wasn't certain. In truth, he thought his problems were deeper than that. However, the fact that\nSpook had been the one to make such an astute observation gave Sazed pause. It was a very clever way\nof looking at things. Instead of contradicting him, Spook had offered a possible explanation.\nSazed was impressed. He turned out, looking across the waters for a time and contemplating what\nSpook had said. Then, he pulled out the next religion in his portfolio and began to consider it. The sooner\nhe got through them, the sooner he could—hopefully—find the truth.\nAllomancy, obviously, is of Preservation. The rational mind will see this. For, in the case of\nAllomancy, net power is gained. It is provided by an external source—Preservation's own body.\n32\n\"ELEND, IS THAT REALLY YOU?\"\nElend turned with shock.

The voice from behind, however, seemed far more familiar. \"Telden?\"\nElend asked. \"What are you doing here!\"\n\"I live here, El,\" Telden said, clasping hands with Elend.\nElend was dumbfounded. He hadn't seen Telden since his house had escaped Luthadel in the days of\nchaos following the death of the Lord Ruler. Once, this man had been one of Elend's best friends. To the\nside, Elend's cousins made a graceful withdrawal. \"I thought you were in BasMardin, Tell,\" Elend said.\n\"No,\" Telden said. \"That's where my house settled, but I thought that the area was too dangerous,\nwhat with the koloss rampages. I moved inward to Fadrex once Lord Yomen came to power—he\nquickly gained a reputation for being able to provide stability.\"\nElend smiled. The years had changed his friend. Telden had once been the model of a debonair ladies'\nman, his hair and expensive suits intended to draw attention. It wasn't that the older Telden had grown\nsloppy, but he obviously didn't take as much care to appear stylish. He'd always been a large man—tall\nand kind of rectangular—and the extra weight he'd gained made him look far more . . . ordinary than he\nonce had.\n\"Elend,\" Telden said, shaking his head. \"You know, for the longest time, I refused to believe that you'd\nreally managed to seize power in Luthadel.\"\n\"You were there at my coronation!\"\n\"I thought that they had picked you as a puppet, El,\" Telden said, rubbing his wide chin. \"I thought . . .\nwell, I'm sorry. I guess I just didn't have much faith in you.\"\nElend laughed. \"You were right, my friend. I turned out to be a terrible king.\"\nTelden obviously wasn't sure how to reply to that.\n\"I did get better at the job,\" Elend said. \"I just had to stumble through a few messes first.\"\nPartygoers shuffled through the divided ballroom. Though those watching did their best to appear\nuninterested and aloof, Elend could tell that they were doing the noble equivalent of gawking. He glanced\nto the side, where Vin stood in her gorgeous black dress, surrounded by a group of women. She seemed\nto be doing well—she took to the courtly scene far better than she liked to let herself think or admit. She\nwas graceful, poised, and the center of attention.\nShe was also alert—Elend could tell by the way she managed to keep her back to a wall or glass\npartition. She'd be burning iron or steel, watching for sudden movements of metal that might indicate an\nattacking Coinshot. Elend began burning iron as well, and he made certain to keep burning zinc to Soothe\nthe emotions of those in the room, keeping them from feeling too angry or threatened by his intrusion.\nOther Allomancers—Breeze, or even Vin—would have had trouble Soothing an entire room at once.\nFor Elend, with his inordinate power, it barely took any attention."

Elend tried to say something to start their conversation\nagain, but he struggled to come up with anything that wouldn't sound awkward. It had been nearly four\nyears since Telden had left Luthadel. Before that, he had been one of the friends with whom Elend had\ndiscussed political theory, planning with the idealism of youth for the day when they would lead their\nhouses. Yet, the days of youth—and their idealistic theories—were gone.\n\"So . . .\" Telden said. \"This is where we end up, is it?\"\nElend nodded.\n\"You're not . . . really going to attack the city, are you?\" Telden asked. \"You're just here to intimidate\nYomen, right?\"\n\"No,\" Elend said softly. \"I will conquer the city if I have to, Telden.\"\nTelden flushed. \"What happened to you, Elend? Where is the man who talked about rights and\nlegality?\"\n\"The world caught up with me, Telden,\" Elend said. \"I can't be the man I was.\"\n\"So you become the Lord Ruler instead?\"\nElend hesitated. It felt odd to have another confront him with his own questions and arguments. Part of\nhim felt a stab of fear—if Telden asked these things, then Elend had been right to worry about them.\nPerhaps they were true.\nYet, a stronger impulse flared within him. An impulse nurtured by Tindwyl, then refined by a year of\nstruggling to bring order to the shattered remains of the Final Empire.\nAn impulse to trust himself.\n\"No, Telden,\" Elend said firmly. \"I'm not the Lord Ruler. A parliamentary council rules in Luthadel, and\nthere are others like it in every city I've brought into my empire. This is the first time that I've marched on\na city with my armies out of a need to conquer, rather than protect—and that is only because Yomen\nhimself took this city from an ally of mine.\"\nTelden snorted. \"You set yourself up as emperor.\"\n\"Because that's what the people need, Telden,\" Elend said. \"They don't want to return to the days of\nthe Lord Ruler—but they would rather do that than live in chaos. Yomen's success here proves that\nmuch. The people want to know that someone is watching over them. They had a god-emperor for a\nthousand years—now is not the time to leave them without a leader.\"\n\"You mean to tell me that you're just a figurehead?\" Telden asked, folding his arms.\n\"Hardly,\" Elend said. \"But, eventually, I hope to be. We both know I'm a scholar and not a king.\"\nTelden frowned. He didn't believe Elend. And yet, Elend found that fact didn't bother him. Something\nabout saying those words, about confronting the skepticism, made him recognize the validity of his own\nconfidence. Telden didn't understand—he hadn't lived through what Elend had.

And, unlike Elend, she'd\nstepped into this ball without knowing a single person.\n\"I feel a little like a proud parent,\" Telden said, laying a hand on Elend's shoulder. \"There were days I\nwas convinced that you were hopeless, El! I figured you'd someday wander into a library and just\ndisappear completely. We'd find you twenty years later covered with dust, picking through some\nphilosophy text for the seven hundredth time.

His meal still remained uneaten, however. Elend didn't wait for\npermission to come to the table, but he did pause and wait as Yomen waved for servants to clear space\nand set Elend a place directly across the high table from him.\nElend sat, trusting in Vin—mixed with his own burning steel and tin—to warn him of attacks from\nbehind. He was the only one on this side of the table, and Yomen's dining companions all retired as Elend\nseated himself, leaving the two rulers alone.

Yomen wore no crown, but he did wear a\nsingle bead of metal tied so that it hung in the center of his forehead.\nAtium.\n\"There is a saying in the Steel Ministry,\" Yomen finally said. \" 'Sit down to dine with evil, and you will\ningest it with your meal.' \"\n\"It's a good thing we're not eating, then,\" Elend said, smiling slightly.\nYomen did not smile back.\n\"Yomen,\" Elend said, growing more serious. \"I come to you now, not as an emperor seeking for new\nlands to control, but as a desperate king seeking allies. The world has become a dangerous place—the\nland itself seems to be fighting us, or at least falling apart beneath us. Accept my hand of friendship, and\nlet us be done with wars.\"\nYomen didn't reply. He just sat, fingers laced, studying Elend.\n\"You doubt my sincerity,\" Elend said. \"I can't say that I blame you, since I marched my army up to\nyour doorstep. Is there a way that I can persuade you? Would you be willing to enter into talks or\nparley?\"\nAgain, no answer. So, this time, Elend just waited. The room around them felt still.\nYomen finally spoke. \"You are a flagrant and garish man, Elend Venture.\"\nElend bristled at that. Perhaps it was the ball setting, perhaps it was the way Yomen so flippantly\nignored his offer. However, Elend found himself responding to the comment in a way he might have years\nbefore, when he hadn't been a king at war. \"It's a bad habit I've always had,\" Elend said. \"I'm afraid that\nthe years of rule—and of being trained in propriety—haven't changed one fact: I'm a terribly rude man.\nBad breeding would be my guess.\""

The world seems near to ending, and I'm just doing\nmy best to help as many people survive as possible.\"\n\"And doing your best includes conquering my city?\"\nElend shook his head. \"I'm not good at lying, Yomen. So, I'll be truthful with you. I don't want to kill\nanyone—as I said, I'd rather we simply made a truce and were done with it. Give me the information I\nseek, pool your resources with mine, and I will not force you to give up your city. Deny me, and things\nwill grow more difficult.\"\nYomen sat quietly for a moment, music still being played softly in the background, vibrating over the\nhum of a hundred polite conversations.\n\"Do you know why I dislike men like you, Venture?\" Yomen finally asked.\n\"My insufferable charm and wit?\" Elend asked. \"I doubt it's my good looks—but, compared to that of\nan obligator, I suppose even my face could be enviable.\"\nYomen's expression darkened. \"How did a man like you ever end up at a table of negotiation?\"\n\"I was trained by a surly Mistborn, a sarcastic Terrisman, and a group of disrespectful thieves,\" Elend\nsaid, sighing. \"Plus, on top of that, I was a fairly insufferable person to begin with. But, kindly continue\nwith your insult—I didn't mean to interrupt.\"\n\"I don't like you,\" Yomen continued, \"because you have the gall to believe that you deserve to take\nthis city.\"\n\"I do,\" Elend said. \"It belonged to Cett; half the soldiers I brought with me on this march once served\nhim, and this is their homeland. We've come to liberate, not conquer.\"\n\"Do these people look to you like they need liberation?\" Yomen said, nodding to the dancing couples.\n\"Yes, actually,\" Elend said. \"Yomen, you're the upstart here—not me. You have no right to this city,\nand you know it.\"\n\"I have the right given me by the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"We don't accept the Lord Ruler's right to rule,\" Elend said. \"That's why we killed him. Instead, we\nlook to the people's right to rule.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Yomen said, hands still laced before him. \"Because, as I recall, the people of your city\nchose Ferson Penrod to be their king.\"\nGood point, that one, Elend had to admit.\nYomen leaned forward. \"This is the reason I don't like you, Venture. You're a hypocrite of the worst\nkind. You pretended to let the people be in charge—but when they ousted you and picked another, you\nhad your Mistborn conquer the city back for you. You rule by force, not by common consent, so don't\ntalk to me about rights.\""

Penrod was working with our enemies, and he\nbought himself the throne through manipulating the assembly.\"\n\"That sounds like a flaw in the system,\" Yomen said. \"A system that you set up—a system replacing\nthe one of order that existed before it. A people depend on stability in their government; they need\nsomeone to look to. A leader that they can trust, a leader with true authority. Only a man chosen by the\nLord Ruler has that claim on authority.\"\nElend studied the obligator. The frustrating thing was, he almost agreed with the man. Yomen said\nthings that Elend himself had said, even if they were twisted a bit by his perspective as an obligator.\n\"Only a man chosen by the Lord Ruler has that claim on authority . . .\" Elend said, frowning. The\nphrase sounded familiar. \"That's from Durton, isn't it? Calling of Trust?\"\nYomen paused. \"Yes.\"\n\"I prefer Gallingskaw, when it comes to divine right.\"\nYomen made a curt gesture. \"Gallingskaw was a heretic.\"\n\"That makes his theories invalid?\" Elend asked.\n\"No,\" Yomen said. \"It shows that he lacked the ability to reason soundly—otherwise he wouldn't have\ngotten himself executed. That affects the validity of his theories. Besides, there is no divine mandate in the\ncommon man, as he proposed.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler was a common man before he took his throne,\" Elend said.\n\"Yes,\" Yomen said, \"but the Lord Ruler touched divinity at the Well of Ascension. That imprinted the\nSliver of Infinity upon him, and gave him the Right of Inference.\"\n\"Vin, my wife, touched that same divinity.\"\n\"I don't accept that story,\" Yomen said. \"As it has been said, the Sliver of Infinity was unique,\nunplanned, uncreated.\"\n\"Don't bring Urdree into this,\" Elend said, raising a finger. \"We both know he was more a poet than a\nreal philosopher—he ignored convention, and never gave proper attributions. At least give me the benefit\nof the doubt and quote Hardren. He'd give you a much better foundation.\"\nYomen opened his mouth, then stopped, frowning. \"This is pointless,\" he said. \"Arguing philosophy will\nnot remove the fact that you have an army camped outside my city, nor change the fact that I find you a\nhypocrite, Elend Venture.\"\nElend sighed. For a moment, he'd thought that they might be able to respect one another as scholars.\nThere was one problem, however. Elend saw true loathing in Yomen's eyes. And, Elend suspected that\nthere was a deeper reason for it than Elend's alleged hypocrisy. After all, Elend had married the woman\nwho had killed Yomen's god.\n\"Yomen,\" Elend said, leaning in. \"I realize we have differences. However, one thing seems clear—we\nboth care about the people of this empire.

Other than that, you may continue as you wish—you can even keep\nthrowing your parties and teaching about the Lord Ruler. I will trust your judgment.\"\nYomen did not scoff at the offer, but Elend could tell that he also didn't give it much weight. He had\nlikely already known what Elend would say.\n\"You mistake one thing, Elend Venture,\" Yomen said.\n\"And that is?\"\n\"That I can be intimidated, bribed, or influenced.\"\n\"You're no fool, Yomen,\" Elend said. \"Sometimes, fighting isn't worth its cost. We both know that you\ncan't beat me.\"\n\"That is debatable,\" Yomen said. \"Regardless, I do not respond well to threats. Perhaps if you didn't\nhave an army camped on my doorstep, I could see my way to an alliance.\"\n\"We both know that without an army on your doorstep, you wouldn't even have listened to me,\" Elend\nsaid. \"You refused every messenger I sent, even before I marched here.\"\nYomen just shook his head. \"You seem more reasonable than I would have thought, Elend Venture,\nbut that doesn't change facts. You already have a large empire of your own. In coming here, you betray\nyour arrogance. Why did you need my dominance? Wasn't what you already had enough?\"\n\"Firstly,\" Elend said, raising a finger, \"I feel that I need to remind you again that you stole this kingdom\nfrom an ally of mine. I had to come here eventually, if only to make good on promises I gave Cett.\nHowever, there's something much larger at play here.\" Elend hesitated, then made a gamble. \"I need to\nknow what is in your storage cavern.\"\nElend was rewarded with a slight look of surprise on Yomen's face, and that was all the confirmation\nElend needed. Yomen did know about the cavern. Vin was right. And considering that atium displayed\nso prominently on his forehead, perhaps she was right about what was contained in the cavern.\n\"Look, Yomen,\" Elend said, speaking quickly. \"I don't care about the atium—it's barely of any value\nanymore. I need to know what instructions the Lord Ruler left in that cavern. What information is there\nfor us? What supplies did he find necessary for our survival?\"\n\"I don't know what you are talking about,\" Yomen said flatly. He wasn't a particularly good liar.\n\"You asked me why I came here,\" Elend said. \"Yomen, it's not about conquering or taking this land\nfrom you. I realize you may find that hard to believe, but it's the truth. The Final Empire is dying. Surely\nyou've seen that. Mankind needs to band together, pool its resources—and you have vital clues we need.\nDon't force me to break down your gates to get them. Work with me.\""

You see, I don't care if you attack me.\"\nHe met Elend's eyes. \"It would be better for my people to fight and to die than to be ruled by the man\nwho overthrew our god and destroyed our religion.\"\nElend held those eyes, and saw determination in them.\n\"That's how it has to be?\" Elend said.\n\"It is,\" Yomen said. \"I can expect an attack in the morning, then?\"\n\"Of course not,\" Elend said, standing. \"Your soldiers aren't starved yet. I'll get back to you in a few\nmonths.\" Maybe then you'll be more willing to deal.\nElend turned to go, then hesitated. \"Nice party, by the way,\" he said, glancing back at Yomen.\n\"Regardless of what I believe, I do think that your god would be pleased with what you've done here. I\nthink you should reconsider your prejudices. The Lord Ruler probably isn't fond of Vin and me, but I'd\nsay that he'd rather that your people live than get themselves killed.\"\nElend nodded in respect, then left the high table, feeling more frustrated than he showed. It felt like\nYomen and he had been so close, and yet at the same time, an alliance seemed impossible. Not while the\nobligator had such hatred of Elend and Vin.\nHe forced himself to relax, walking. There was little he could do about the situation at the moment—it\nwould take the siege to make Yomen rethink his position. I'm at a ball, Elend thought, wandering. I\nshould enjoy what I can of it, letting myself be seen by the nobility here, intimidating them and\nmaking them think about helping us instead of Yomen. . . .\nA thought occurred to him. He glanced at Vin, then waved a servant over to him.\n\"My lord?\" the man asked.\n\"I need you to fetch something for me,\" Elend said.\nVin was the center of attention. Women pandered to her, hung on her words, and looked to her as a\nmodel. They wanted to know news from Luthadel, to hear about fashion, politics, and events from the\ngreat city. They didn't reject her, or even seem to resent her.\nThe instant acceptance was the strangest thing Vin had ever experienced. She stood amid the women\nin their gowns and finery, and was foremost among them. She knew that it was just because of her\npower—yet, the women of this city seemed almost desperate to have someone to look to. An empress.\nAnd Vin found herself enjoying it. There was a part of her that had craved this acceptance since the\nfirst day she'd attended a ball. She'd spent that year being mistreated by most of the women of\ncourt—some had let her join with their company, but she'd always been an insignificant country\nnoblewoman with no connections or significance. It was a shallow thing, this acceptance, but sometimes\neven shallow things feel important. Plus, there was something else about it. As she smiled toward a\nnewcomer—a young niece that one of the women wanted to meet Vin—Vin realized what it was."

As she smiled toward a\nnewcomer—a young niece that one of the women wanted to meet Vin—Vin realized what it was.\nThis is part of me, she thought. I didn't want it to be—perhaps because I didn't believe that I\ndeserved it. I found this life too different, too full of beauty and confidence. Yet, I am a\nnoblewoman. I do fit in here.\nI was born to the streets by one parent, but I was born to this by another.\nShe'd spent the first year of Elend's reign trying so hard to protect him. She'd forced herself to focus\nonly on her street side, the side that had been trained to be ruthless, for that, she thought, would give her\nthe power to defend what she loved. Yet, Kelsier had shown her another way to be powerful. And, that\npower was connected with the nobility—with their intrigue, their beauty, and their clever schemes. Vin\nhad taken almost immediately to life at court, and that had frightened her.\nThat's it, she thought, smiling at another curtsying young girl. That's why I always felt that this was\nwrong. I didn't have to work for it, so I couldn't believe that I deserved it.\nShe'd spent sixteen years on the streets—she'd earned that side of her. Yet, it had taken her barely a\nmonth to adapt to noble life. It had seemed impossible to her that something that came so easily could be\nas important a part of herself as the years spent on the streets.\nBut it was.\nI had to confront this, she realized. Tindwyl tried to make me do it, two years ago, but I wasn't\nready.\nShe needed to prove to herself not only that she could move among the nobility, but that she belonged\nwith them. Because that proved something much more important: that the love she'd earned from Elend\nduring those few early months wasn't based on a falsehood.\nIt's . . . true, Vin thought. I can be both. Why did it take me so long to figure it out?\n\"Excuse me, ladies,\" a voice said.\nVin smiled, turning as the women parted to make way for Elend. Several of the younger ones got\ndreamy expressions on their faces as they regarded Elend with his warrior's body, his rugged beard, and\nhis white imperial uniform. Vin suppressed a huff of annoyance. She'd loved him long before he'd become\ndreamy.\n\"Ladies,\" Elend said to the women, \"as Lady Vin herself will be quick to tell you, I'm rather\nill-mannered. That, in itself, would be a very small sin. Unfortunately, I'm also quite unconcerned about\nmy own disregard for propriety. So, therefore, I'm going to steal my wife away from you all and selfishly\nmonopolize her time. I'd apologize, but that's not the sort of thing we barbarians do.\"\nWith that, and with a smile, he held out his elbow to her. Vin smiled back, taking the arm and allowing\nhim to lead her away from the pack of women.\n\"Thought you might want some room to breathe,\" Elend said. \"I can only imagine how it must make\nyou feel to be surrounded by a virtual army of puffballs.\""

How was Elend to know that she'd\nsuddenly discovered that she fit in with those puffballs? Besides, just because they wore frills and makeup\ndidn't mean they weren't dangerous—she'd learned that much easily her first few months. The thought\ndistracted her such that she didn't notice where Elend was leading her until they were almost there.\nWhen she did realize it, she stopped immediately, jerking Elend back. \"The dance floor?\" she asked.\n\"Indeed,\" he said.\n\"But, I haven't danced in almost four years!\"\n\"Neither have I,\" Elend said. He stepped closer. \"But, it would be terrible to miss the opportunity.\nAfter all, we never did get to dance.\"\nIt was true. Luthadel had gone into revolt before they'd gotten an opportunity to dance together, and\nafter that, there hadn't been time for balls or frivolity. She knew Elend understood how much she missed\nnot having had the chance. He'd asked her to dance on the first night when they'd met, and she'd turned\nhim down. She still felt as if she'd given up some unique opportunity on that first evening.\nAnd so, she let him lead her up onto the slightly raised dance floor. Couples whispered, and as the\nsong ended, everyone else furtively departed the dance floor, leaving Vin and Elend alone—a figure in\nlines of white, and another in curves of black. Elend put an arm at her waist, turning her toward him, and\nVin found herself traitorously nervous.\nThis is it, she thought, flaring pewter to keep from shaking. It's finally happening. I finally get to\ndance with him!\nAt that moment—as the music began—Elend reached into his pocket and pulled out a book. He\nraised it with one hand, the other on her waist, and began to read.\nVin's jaw dropped, then she whacked him on the arm. \"What do you think you're doing?\" she\ndemanded as he shuffled through the dance steps, still holding his book. \"Elend! I'm trying to have a\nspecial moment here!\"\nHe turned toward her, smiling with a terribly mischievous grin. \"Well, I want to make that special\nmoment as authentic as possible. I mean, you are dancing with me, after all.\"\n\"For the first time!\"\n\"All the more important to be certain that I make the right impression, Miss Valette!\"\n\"Oh, for . . . Will you please just put the book away?\"\nElend smiled more deeply, but slid the book back into his pocket, taking her hand and dancing with\nher in a more proper manner. Vin flushed as she saw the confused crowd standing around the dance\nfloor. They obviously had no idea what to make of Elend's behavior.\n\"You are a barbarian,\" Vin told him.\n\"A barbarian because I read books?\" Elend said lightly. \"That's one that Ham will have a great time\nwith.\"\n\"Honestly,\" Vin said, \"where did you even get a book here?\""

I haven't seen you like this for quite some time.\"\n\"I know,\" he said, sighing. \"To be honest, Vin, I feel a bit guilty. I'm worried that I was too informal\nduring my conversation with Yomen. He's so stiff that my old instincts—the ones that always made me\nrespond to people like him with mockery—came out.\"\nVin let him lead the dance, looking up at him. \"You're just acting like yourself. That's a good thing.\"\n\"My old self didn't make a good king,\" Elend said.\n\"The things you learned about kingship didn't have to do with your personality, Elend,\" Vin said. \"They\nhad to do with other things—about confidence, and about decisiveness. You can have those things and\nstill be yourself.\"\nElend shook his head. \"I'm not sure I can. Certainly, tonight, I should have been more formal. I\nallowed the setting to make me lax.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said firmly. \"No, I'm right about this, Elend. You've been doing the exact thing I have.\nYou've been so determined to be a good king that you've let it squish who you really are. Our\nresponsibilities shouldn't have to destroy us.\"\n\"They haven't destroyed you,\" he said, smiling behind his short beard.\n\"They nearly did,\" Vin said. \"Elend, I had to realize that I could be both people—the Mistborn of the\nstreets and the woman of the court. I had to acknowledge that the new person I'm becoming is a valid\nextension of who I am. But for you, it's opposite! You have to realize that who you were is still a valid\npart of you. That person makes silly comments, and does things just to provoke a reaction. But, he's also\nlovable and kindhearted. You can't lose those things just because you're emperor.\"\nHe got that look in his face, the thoughtful one, the one that meant he was going to argue. Then,\nhowever, he hesitated.\n\"Coming to this place,\" he said, looking at the beautiful windows and watching the nobility, \"it's\nreminded me of what I spent most of my life doing. Before I had to be a king. Even then, I was trying to\ndo things my way—I went off and read during balls. But, I didn't do it away in the library, I did it in the\nballroom.

However, he was thinking. That was enough, at the moment.\nVin looked up into his eyes, and they returned to the dance. Neither spoke; they simply let the wonder\nof the moment hold them. It was a surreal experience for Vin. Their army was outside, the ash was falling\nperpetually, and the mists were killing people. Yet, inside this room of white marble and sparkling colors,\nshe danced with the man she loved for the first time.\nThey both spun with the grace of Allomancy, stepping as if on the wind, moving as if made of mist.\nThe room grew hushed, the nobility like a theater audience, watching some grand performance, not two\npeople who hadn't danced in years. And yet, Vin knew it was wonderful, something that had rarely been\nseen. Most noble Mistborn couldn't afford to appear too graceful, lest they give away their secret\npowers.\nVin and Elend had no such inhibitions. They danced as if to make up for the four years lost, as if to\nthrow their joy in the face of an apocalyptic world and a hostile city. The song began to wind down.\nElend pulled her against him, and her tin let her feel his heartbeat so close. It was beating far more swiftly\nthan a simple dance could account for.\n\"I'm glad we did this,\" he said.\n\"There's another ball soon,\" she said. \"In a few weeks.\"\n\"I know,\" he said. \"As I understand it, that ball is going to be held at the Canton of Resource.\"\nVin nodded. \"Thrown by Yomen himself.\"\n\"And, if the supply cache is hidden anywhere in the city, it will most likely be beneath that building.\"\n\"We'd have an excuse—and a precedent—to get in.\"\n\"Yomen has some atium,\" Elend said. \"He's wearing a bead of it on his forehead. Though, just because\nhe has one bead doesn't mean he has a wealth of it.\"\nVin nodded. \"I wonder if he's found the storage cavern.\"\n\"He has,\" Elend said, \"I'm sure of it. I got a reaction out of him when I mentioned it.\"\n\"That still shouldn't stop us,\" Vin said, smiling. \"We go to his ball, sneak into the cavern, find out what\nthe Lord Ruler left there, then decide what to do about the siege—and the city—based on that?\""

She shot out over the crowd, guiding herself toward the exit, dress\nflapping.\nBehind, Elend addressed the crowd. \"Thank you so much for letting us join you. Anyone who wants to\nescape the city will be allowed passage through my army.\"\nVin landed and saw the crowd turn as Elend jumped over their heads, fortunately managing to guide\nhimself through the relatively low room without crashing into any windows or hitting the ceiling.

The younger\nkandra were more extreme in form, the older were more orthodox.\nAll were accusatory.\nBefore, at the trial, the crowd had been curious—perhaps horrified. That had changed; TenSoon's\ntime spent in the display cage had worked as intended. The Second Generation had been able to\npromote his infamy, and kandra who had once, perhaps, been sympathetic to him now watched with\ndisgust. In a thousand years of history, the kandra had never had a criminal such as TenSoon.\nHe bore the stares and the scorn with a raised head, padding through the corridor in a dog's body. It\nwas strange to him, how natural the bones felt. He'd only spent a year's time wearing them, but putting\nthem on again—discarding the scrawny, naked human body—felt more like returning home than coming\nback to the Homeland had a year before.\nAnd so, what was supposed to be a humiliation for him became, instead, something of a triumph. It\nhad been a wild hope, but he'd manipulated the Second Generation into giving him back the dog's body.\nThe sack had even contained the body's hair and nails—likely, they had simply collected the entire mess\nafter forcing TenSoon to abandon it and enter his prison a year ago.\nThe comfortable bones gave him strength. This was the body that Vin had given him. She was the\nHero of Ages. He had to believe that.\nOtherwise he was about to make a very big mistake."

He had to believe that.\nOtherwise he was about to make a very big mistake.\nHis guards led him into the Trustwarren. This time, there were too many observers to fit into the room,\nso the Seconds declared that those younger than the Seventh Generation had to wait outside. Even so,\nkandra filled the rows of stone seats. They sat silently as TenSoon was led to the slightly raised metallic\ndisk set into the center of the stone floor. The broad doors were left open, and younger kandra crowded\noutside, listening.\nTenSoon looked up as he stepped onto his platform. The lump-like shadows of the First Generation\nwaited above, each one in his separate alcove, backlit faintly in blue.\nKanPaar approached his lectern. TenSoon could see the satisfaction in the way KanPaar slid across\nthe floor. The Second felt that his triumph was complete—what happened to those who ignored the\ndirectives of the Second Generation would not soon be forgotten. TenSoon settled back on his haunches,\nguarded by two kandra with the Blessing of Potency twinkling in each shoulder. They carried large\nmallets.\n\"TenSoon of the Third Generation,\" KanPaar said loudly. \"Are you ready to bear the sentence of your\njudgment?\"\n\"There will be no judgment,\" TenSoon said. His words slurred, coming from the dog's mouth, but they\nwere clear enough to understand.\n\"No judgment?\" KanPaar asked, amused. \"You now seek to back out of what you yourself\ndemanded?\"\n\"I came to give information, not to be judged.\"\n\"I—\"\n\"I'm not speaking to you, KanPaar,\" TenSoon said, turning from the Second to look up. \"I'm talking to\nthem.\"\n\"They heard your words, Third,\" KanPaar snapped. \"Control yourself! I will not let you turn this\njudgment into a circus, as you did before.\"\nTenSoon smiled. Only a kandra would consider a mild argument to be a 'circus.' TenSoon didn't turn\naway from the First Generation's alcoves, however.\n\"Now,\" KanPaar said. \"We—\"\n\"You!\" TenSoon bellowed, causing KanPaar to sputter again. \"First Generation! How long will you sit\nin your comfortable home, pretending that the world above doesn't exist? You think that if you ignore the\nproblems, they won't affect you? Or, is it that you've stopped believing in your own teachings?\n\"The days of mist have come! The endless ash now falls! The earth shakes and trembles. You can\ncondemn me, but you must not ignore me! The world will soon die! If you want people—in all of their\nforms—to survive, you must act! You must be ready! For you may soon need to command our people\nto accept the Resolution!\"\nThe room fell silent. Several of the shadows above shuffled, as if discomfited—though kandra\ngenerally didn't react in such a way. It was too disorderly.\nThen a voice—soft, scratchy, and very tired—spoke from above. \"Proceed, KanPaar.\"\nThe comment was so unexpected that several members of the audience actually gasped.

The First\nGeneration never spoke in the presence of lessers. TenSoon wasn't awed—he'd seen them, and talked\nwith them, before they'd grown too superior to deal with anyone but the Seconds. No, he wasn't awed.\nHe was just disappointed.\n\"My faith in you was misplaced,\" he said, mostly to himself. \"I should not have returned.\"\n\"TenSoon of the Third Generation!\" KanPaar said, standing up straight, crystalline True Body\nsparkling as he pointed. \"You have been sentenced to the ritual imprisonment of ChanGaar! You will be\nbeaten to the point of fracture, then bricked into a pit, with only one hole for your daily slop. You will\nremain there for ten generations! Only after that will you be executed by starvation! Know that your\ngreatest sin was that of rebellion. If you had not strayed from the advice and wisdom of this council, you\nwould never have thought it right to break the First Contract. Because of you, the Trust has been\nendangered, as has every kandra of every generation!\"\nKanPaar let the pronouncement ring in the chamber. TenSoon sat quietly on his haunches. KanPaar\nhad obviously expected some kind of response from him, but TenSoon gave none. Finally, KanPaar\ngestured to the guards beside TenSoon, who hefted their fearsome hammers.\n\"You know, KanPaar,\" TenSoon said, \"I learned a few important things while wearing these bones a\nyear ago.\"\nKanPaar gestured again. The guards raised their weapons.\n\"It's something I had never paused to consider,\" TenSoon said. \"Humans, if you think about it, just\naren't built for speed. Dogs, however, are.\"\nThe hammers fell.\nTenSoon leaped forward.\nThe powerful dog's haunches launched him into motion. TenSoon was a member of the Third\nGeneration. Nobody had been eating and emulating bodies as long as he had, and he knew how to pack\nmuscles into a body. In addition, he had spent a year wearing the bones of a wolfhound, being forced to\ntry to keep up with his Mistborn master. He had undergone what had effectively been a year of training\nby one of the most talented Allomancers the world had ever known.\nOn top of that, a body mass that had translated from a scrawny human made quite a substantial\nwolfhound. This, combined with his skill in crafting bodies, meant that when TenSoon jumped, he\njumped. His guards cried out in shock as TenSoon sprang away, his leap taking him at least ten feet\nacross the room. He hit the ground running, but didn't head for the door. They'd be expecting that.\nInstead he sprang directly toward KanPaar. The foremost of Seconds cried out, throwing up\nineffectual hands as a hundred pounds of wolfhound crashed into him, throwing him to the stone floor.\nTenSoon heard sharp cracks as KanPaar's delicate bones shattered, and KanPaar screamed in a very\nun-kandra-like way.\nThat seems appropriate, TenSoon thought, shoving his way through the ranks of the Seconds,"

Honestly, what kind of vain fool wears a True Body made of crystal?\nMany of the kandra didn't know how to react. Others—especially the younger ones—had spent a lot\nof time around humans on Contracts, and they were more accustomed to chaos. These scattered, leaving\ntheir elder companions sitting on the benches in shock. TenSoon darted between bodies, heading toward\nthe doors. The guards beside the podium—the ones who would have shattered his bones—rushed to\nKanPaar's side, their filial sense of duty overriding their desire to prevent his escape. Besides, they must\nhave seen the crowd clogging the doorway, and assumed that TenSoon would be slowed.\nAs soon as he reached the crowd, TenSoon jumped again. Vin had required him to be able to leap\nincredible heights, and he'd practiced with many different muscle structures. This jump wouldn't have\nimpressed Vin—TenSoon no longer had the Blessing of Potency he'd stolen from OreSeur—but it was\nmore than enough to let him clear the watching kandra. Some cried out, and he landed in a pocket of\nopen space, then leaped again toward the open cavern beyond.\n\"No!\" he heard echoing from the Trustwarren. \"Go after him!\"\nTenSoon took off in a loping dash down one of the corridors. He ran quickly—far more quickly than\nanything bipedal could have managed. With his canine body, he hoped he'd be able to outrun even\nkandra bearing the Blessing of Potency.\nFarewell, my home, TenSoon thought, leaving the main cavern behind. And farewell to what little\nhonor I had left.\nPART THREE\nTHE BROKEN SKIES\nFeruchemy, it should be noted, is the power of balance. Of the three powers, only it was known to\nmen before the conflict between Preservation and Ruin came to a head. In Feruchemy, power is\nstored up, then later drawn upon. There is no loss of energy—just a changing of the time and rate\nof its use.\n34\nMARSH STRODE INTO THE SMALL TOWN. Workers atop the makeshift gate—which looked\nflimsy enough that a determined knock would send it toppling—froze in place. Ash sweepers noticed him\npass with shock, then horror. It was odd, how they watched, too terrified to flee. Or, at least, too\nterrified to be the first one to flee.\nMarsh ignored them. The earth trembled beneath him in a beautiful song—quakes were common,\nhere, in the shadow of Mount Tyrian. It was the ashmount closest to Luthadel. Marsh walked through\nElend Venture's own territory. But, of course, the emperor had abandoned it. That seemed an invitation\nto Marsh, and to the one who controlled him. They were really the same. Marsh smiled as he walked.\nA small piece of him was still free. He let it sleep, however. Ruin needed to think he had given up. That\nwas the point.

He let the ashen sky become\na thing of bespeckled beauty, and treated the death of the world as a blessed event.\nBiding his time. Waiting.\nThe village was an inspiring sight. The people were starving here, even though they were within the\nCentral Dominance: Elend Venture's \"protected\" area. They had the wonderful, haunted expressions of\nthose who were close to giving up hope. The streets were barely maintained, the homes—which had\nonce been the dwellings of noblemen, but were now filled with hungry skaa—covered in ash, their\ngardens stripped and their structures cannibalized to feed fires during the winter.\nThe gorgeous sight made Marsh smile with satisfaction. Behind him, people finally started to move,\nfleeing, doors slamming. There were probably some six or seven thousand people living in the town. They\nwere not Marsh's concern. Not at the moment.\nHe was interested only in a single, specific building. It looked little different from the others, a mansion\nin a fine row. The town had once been a stopping place for travelers, and had grown to be a favored\nplace for nobility to construct second homes. A few noble families had lived here permanently,\noverseeing the many skaa who had worked the plantations and fields on the plains outside.\nThe building Marsh chose was slightly better maintained than those around it. The garden was, of\ncourse, more weeds than cultivation, and the outer mansion walls hadn't seen a good scrubbing in years.\nHowever, fewer sections of it looked to have been broken apart for firewood, and a guard actually stood\nwatch at the front gate.\nMarsh killed him with one of the razor-sharp metal triangles that had once been used in the Lord\nRuler's ceremonies. Marsh Pushed it through the guard's chest even as the man opened his mouth in\nchallenge. The air was oddly still and quiet as the guard's voice cut off, and he toppled to the side in the\nroad. The skaa who watched from nearby homes knew better than to react, and didn't stir.\nMarsh hummed to himself as he strolled up the front walk to the mansion, startling a small flock of\nravens who had come to roost. Once this path would have been a calming stroll through gardens, the\nway marked by flagstones. Now it was simply a hike through a weed-filled field. The man who owned\nthe place obviously couldn't afford more than the lone gate guard, and nobody raised an alarm at Marsh's\napproach. He was actually able to walk right up to the front doors. Smiling to himself, he knocked.\nA maidservant opened the doors. She froze when she saw Marsh, taking in his spiked eyes, his\nunnaturally tall figure, his dark robes. Then she began to tremble.\nMarsh held out a hand, palm up, with another of the triangles. Then he Pushed it straight into her face.\nIt snapped out the back of the skull, and the woman toppled. He stepped over her body and entered the\nhouse.\nIt was far nicer inside than the exterior had led him to expect. Rich furnishings, freshly painted walls,\nintricate ceramics. Marsh raised an eyebrow, scanning the room with his spiked eyes. The way his sight\nworked, it was hard for him to distinguish colors, but he was familiar enough with his powers now that he"

The way his sight\nworked, it was hard for him to distinguish colors, but he was familiar enough with his powers now that he\ncould pick them out if he wanted. The Allomantic lines from the metals inside of most things were really\nquite expressive.\nTo Marsh, the mansion was a place of pristine whiteness and bright blobs of expensive color. Marsh\nsearched through it, burning pewter to enhance his physical abilities, allowing him to walk much more\nlightly than would otherwise have been possible. He killed two more servants in the course of his\nexploration, and eventually moved up to the second floor.\nHe found the man he wanted sitting at a desk in a top-floor room. Balding, wearing a rich suit. He had\na petite mustache set in a round face, and was slumped, eyes closed, a bottle of hard liquor empty at his\nfeet. Marsh saw this with displeasure.\n\"I come all this way to get you,\" Marsh said. \"And when I finally find you, I discover that you have\nintoxicated yourself into a stupor?\"\nThe man had never met Marsh, of course. That didn't stop Marsh from feeling annoyed that he\nwouldn't be able to see the look of terror and surprise in the man's eyes when he found an Inquisitor in\nhis home. Marsh would miss out on the fear, the anticipation of death. Briefly, Marsh was tempted to\nwait until the man sobered up so that the killing could be performed properly.\nBut, Ruin would have none of that. Marsh sighed at the injustice of it, then slammed the unconscious\nman down against the floor and drove a small bronze spike through his heart. It wasn't as large or thick\nas an Inquisitor spike, but it killed just as well. Marsh ripped it out of the man's heart, leaving the former\nnobleman dead, blood pooling on the floor.\nThen, Marsh walked out, leaving the building. The nobleman—Marsh didn't even know his\nname—had used Allomancy recently. The man was a Smoker, a Misting who could create\ncopperclouds, and the use of his ability had drawn Ruin's attention. Ruin had been wanting an Allomancer\nto drain.\nAnd so, Marsh had come to harvest the man's power and draw it into the spike. It seemed something\nof a waste to him. Hemalurgy—particularly Allomantic imbues—was much more potent when one could\ndrive the spike through the victim's heart and directly into a waiting host. That way, very little of the\nAllomantic ability was lost. Doing it this way—killing the Allomancer to make a spike, then traveling\nsomewhere else to place it—would grant the new host far less power.\nBut, there was no getting around it in this case. Marsh shook his head as he stepped over the\nmaidservant's body again, moving out into the unkempt gardens. No one accosted, or even looked at,\nhim as he made his way to the front gates. There, however, he was surprised to find a couple of skaa\nmen kneeling on the ground.\n\"Please, Your Grace,\" one said as Marsh passed. \"Please, send the obligators back to us. We will\nserve better this time.\"\n\"You have lost that opportunity,\" Marsh said, staring at them with his spike-heads."

Please. Our families have no food.\"\n\"Well,\" Marsh said. \"You needn't worry about that for long.\"\nThe men knelt, confused, as Marsh left. He didn't kill them, though part of him wished to.\nUnfortunately, Ruin wanted to claim that privilege for himself.\nMarsh walked across the plain outside the town. After about an hour's time he stopped, turning to\nlook back at the community and the towering ashmount behind it.\nAt that moment, the top left half of the mountain exploded, spewing a deluge of dust, ash, and rock.\nThe earth shook, and a booming sound washed over Marsh. Then, flaming hot and red, a large gout of\nmagma began to flow down the side of the ashmount toward the plain.\nMarsh shook his head. Yes. Food was hardly this town's biggest problem. They really needed to get\ntheir priorities straight.\nHemalurgy is a power about which I wish I knew far less. To Ruin, power must have an\ninordinately high cost—using it must be attractive, yet must sow chaos and destruction in its very\nimplementation.\nIn concept, it is a very simple art. A parasitic one. Without other people to steal from,\nHemalurgy would be useless.\n35\n\"YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT HERE?\" Spook asked.\nBreeze turned away from the brightened tavern, raising an eyebrow. Spook had brought him—along\nwith several of Goradel's soldiers in street clothing—to one of the larger, more reputable locations.\nVoices rang within.\n\"Yes, this should be fine,\" Breeze said, eyeing the tavern. \"Skaa out at night. Never thought I'd see\nthat. Perhaps the world really is ending. . . .\"\n\"I'm going to go to one of the poorer sections of town,\" Spook said quietly. \"There are some things I\nwant to check on.\"\n\"Poorer sections,\" Breeze said musingly. \"Perhaps I should accompany you. I've found that the poorer\npeople are, the more likely they are to let their tongues wag.\"\nSpook raised an eyebrow. \"No offense, Breeze, but I kind of think you'd stand out.\"\n\"What?\" Breeze asked, nodding toward his utilitarian brown worker's outfit—quite a change from his\nusual suit and vest. \"I'm wearing these dreadful clothes, aren't I?\"\n\"Clothing isn't everything, Breeze. You've kind of got a . . . bearing about you. Plus, you don't have\nmuch ash on you.\"\n\"I was infiltrating the lower ranks before you were born, child,\" Breeze said, wagging a finger at him.\n\"All right,\" Spook said. He reached to the ground, scooping up a pile of ash. \"Let's just rub this into\nyour clothing and on your face. . . .\"\nBreeze froze. \"I'll meet you back at the lair,\" he finally said.\nSpook smiled, dropping the ash as he disappeared into the mists.\n\"I never did like him,\" Kelsier whispered.\nSpook left the richer section of town, moving at a brisk pace.

When he hit the streetslot, he didn't\nstop, but simply leaped off the side of the road and plummeted twenty feet.\nHis cloak flapped behind him as he fell. He landed easily and continued his quick pace. Without\npewter, he would certainly have broken some limbs. Now he moved with the same dexterity he'd once\nenvied in Vin and Kelsier. He felt exhilarated. With pewter flaring inside of him, he never felt tired—never\neven felt fatigued. Even simple acts, like walking down the street, made him feel full of grace and power.\nHe moved quickly to the Harrows, leaving behind the streets of better men, entering the cluttered,\noverpacked alley-like streetslot, knowing exactly where he'd find his quarry. Durn was one of the leading\nfigures in the Urteau underworld. Part informant, part beggar lord, the unfulfilled musician had become a\nsort of a mayor of the Harrows. Men like that had to be where people could find—and pay—them.\nSpook still remembered that first night after waking from his fevers a few weeks back, the night when\nhe'd visited a tavern and heard men talking about him. Over the next few days, he'd visited several other\ntaverns, and had heard others mention rumors that spoke of Spook. Sazed and Breeze's arrival had kept\nSpook from confronting Durn—the apparent source of the rumors—about what he'd been telling people.\nIt was time to correct that oversight.\nSpook picked up his pace, leaping heaps of discarded boards, dashing around piles of ash, until he\nreached the hole that Durn called home. It was a section of canal wall that had been hollowed out to form\na kind of cave. Though the wooden framing around the door looked as rotted and splintered as\neverything else in the Harrows, Spook knew it to be reinforced on the back with a thick oaken bar.\nTwo brutes sat watch outside. They eyed Spook as he stopped in front of the door, cloak whipping\naround him. It was the same one he'd been wearing when he'd been tossed into the fire, and it was still\nspotted with burn marks and holes.\n\"The boss isn't seeing anyone right now, kid,\" said one of the big men, not rising from his seat. \"Come\nback later.\"\nSpook kicked the door. It broke free, its hinges snapping, the bar shattering its mountings and\ntumbling backward.\nSpook stood for a moment, shocked. He had too little experience with pewter to gauge its use\naccurately. If he was shocked, however, the two brutes were stunned. They sat, staring at the broken\ndoor.\n\"You may need to kill them,\" Kelsier whispered.\nNo, Spook thought. I just have to move quickly. He dashed into the open hallway, needing no torch\nor lantern by which to see. He whipped spectacles and a cloth out of his pocket as he approached the\ndoor at the end of the hallway, fixing them in place even as the guards called out behind him.\nHe threw his shoulder against the door with a bit more care, slamming it open but not breaking it. He\nmoved into a well-lit room where four men sat playing chips at a table. Durn was winning."

The brutes rushed up behind Spook, and he turned,\nfalling to a crouch, reaching under his cloak for his dueling cane.\n\"It's all right,\" Durn said, standing. \"Leave us.\"\nThe guards hesitated, obviously angry at being passed so easily. Finally, however, they withdrew,\nDurn's gambling partners going with them. The door closed.\n\"That was quite the entrance,\" Durn noted, sitting back down at his table.\n\"You've been talking about me, Durn,\" Spook said, turning. \"I've heard people discussing me in\ntaverns, mentioning your name. You've been spreading rumors about my death, telling people that I was\non the Survivor's crew. How did you know who I was, and why have you been using my name?\"\n\"Oh, come now,\" Durn said, scowling. \"How anonymous did you think you were? You're the\nSurvivor's friend, and you spend a good half your time living in the emperor's own palace.\"\n\"Luthadel's a long way from here.\"\n\"Not so far that news doesn't travel,\" Durn said. \"A Tineye comes to town, spying about, flaunting\nseemingly endless funds? It wasn't really that hard to figure out who you were. Besides, there's your\neyes.\"\n\"What about them?\" Spook asked.\nThe ugly man shrugged. \"Everyone knows that strange things happen around the Survivor's crew.\"\nSpook wasn't certain what to make of that. He walked forward, looking over the cards on the table.\nHe picked one up, feeling its paper. His heightened senses let him feel the bumps on the back.\n\"Marked cards?\" he asked.\n\"Of course,\" Durn said. \"Practice game, to see if my men could read the patterns right.\"\nSpook tossed the card onto the table. \"You still haven't told me why you've been spreading rumors\nabout me.\"\n\"No offense, kid,\" Durn said. \"But . . . well, you're supposed to be dead.\"\n\"If you believed that, then why bother talking about me?\"\n\"Why do you think?\" Durn said. \"The people love the Survivor—and anything related to him. That's\nwhy Quellion uses his name so often. But, if I could show that Quellion killed one of Kelsier's own crew .\n. . well, there are a lot of people in this city who wouldn't like that.\"\n\"So, you're just trying to help,\" Spook said flatly. \"Out of the goodness of your heart.\"\n\"You're not the only one who thinks that Quellion is killing this city. If you're really of the Survivor's\ncrew, you'll know that sometimes, people fight.\"\n\"I find it difficult to think of you as an altruist, Durn. You're a thief.\"\n\"So are you.\"\n\"We didn't know what we were getting into,\" Spook said. \"Kelsier promised us riches. How do you\ngain from all this?\""

Our smuggling has been choked to a trickle because everyone fears buying our goods. Things were\nnever this bad under the Lord Ruler.\" He leaned in. \"If your friends staying in the old Ministry building\nthink they can do something about that lunatic running this city, then tell them they'll have my support.\nThere isn't a large underground left in this city, but Quellion will be surprised at the damage it can do if\nmanipulated the right way.\"\nSpook stood quietly for a moment. \"There's a man milking for information in the tavern on Westbrook\nLane. Send someone to contact him. He's a Soother—the best one you'll ever meet—but he stands out a\nbit. Make your offer to him.\"\nDurn nodded.\nSpook turned to go, then glanced back at Durn. \"Don't mention my name to him, or what happened to\nme.\"\nWith that, he left through the hallway, passing the guards and the displaced crooks from the card\ngame. Spook pulled off his blindfold as he stepped into the daylight-like brightness of the starlit night.\nHe strolled through the Harrows, trying to decide what he thought of the meeting. Durn hadn't revealed\nanything all that important. Yet, Spook felt as if something were happening around him, something he\nhadn't planned on, something he couldn't quite decipher. He was becoming more comfortable with\nKelsier's voice, and with his pewter, but he was still worried that he wouldn't be able to live up to the\nposition he'd fallen into.\n\"If you don't get to Quellion soon,\" Kelsier said, \"he's going to find your friends. He's already\npreparing assassins.\"\n\"He won't send them,\" Spook said quietly. \"Especially if he's heard Durn's rumors about me. Everyone\nknows that Sazed and Breeze were on your crew.

You don't want to find out how\nirrational he can be.\"\nSpook fell silent. Then, he heard footsteps, approaching quickly. He felt the vibrations in the ground.\nHe spun and loosened his cloak, reaching for his weapon.\n\"You're not in danger,\" Kelsier said quietly.\nSpook relaxed as someone rushed around the alley corner. It was one of the men from Durn's chips\ngame. The man was puffing, his face flush with exhaustion. \"My lord!\" he said.\n\"I'm no lord,\" Spook said. \"What happened? Is Durn in danger?\"\n\"No, sir,\" the man said. \"I just . . . I . . .\"\nSpook raised an eyebrow.\n\"I need your help,\" the man said between breaths. \"When we realized who you were, you were\nalready gone.

Durn hid\nme, but Mailey, she got sold by the woman I'd left her with. Sir, she's only seven. He's going to burn her\nin a few days!\"\nSpook frowned. What does he expect me to do? He opened his mouth to ask that very question, but\nthen stopped. He wasn't the same man anymore. He wasn't limited as the old Spook would have been.\nHe could do something else.\nWhat Kelsier would have done.\n\"Can you gather ten men?\" Spook asked. \"Friends of yours, willing to take part in some late-night\nwork?\"\n\"Sure. I guess. Does this have to do with saving Mailey?\"\n\"No,\" Spook said. \"It has to do with your payment for saving Mailey. Get me those workers, and I'll\ndo what I can to help your sister.\"\nThe man nodded eagerly.\n\"Do it now,\" Spook said, pointing. \"We start tonight.\"\nIn Hemalurgy, the type of metal used in a spike is important, as is the positioning of that spike on\nthe body. For instance, steel spikes take physical Allomantic powers—the ability to burn pewter,\ntin, steel, or iron—and bestow them upon the person receiving the spike. Which of these four is\ngranted, however, depends on where the spike is placed.\nSpikes made from other metals steal Feruchemical abilities. For example, all of the original\nInquisitors were given a pewter spike, which—after first being pounded through the body of a\nFeruchemist—gave the Inquisitor the ability to store up healing power. (Though they couldn't do\nso as quickly as a real Feruchemist, as per the law of Hemalurgic decay.) This, obviously, is where\nthe Inquisitors got their infamous ability to recover from wounds quickly, and was also why they\nneeded to rest so much.\n36\n\"YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE IN,\" Cett said flatly.\nElend raised an eyebrow, riding his stallion through the center of his camp. Tindwyl had taught him that\nit was good to be seen by one's people, especially in situations where he could control the way he was\nperceived. He happened to agree with this particular lesson, and so he rode, wearing a black cloak to\nmask the ash's smudges, making certain his soldiers knew that he was among them. Cett rode with him,\ntied into his specially made saddle.\n\"You think I put myself in too much danger by entering the city?\" Elend asked, nodding to a group of\nsoldiers who had paused in their morning labors to salute him.\n\"No,\" Cett said, \"we both know that I don't give a damn whether you live or die, boy. Besides, you're\nMistborn. You could have gotten out if things turned dangerous.\"\n\"Why, then?\" Elend asked. \"Why was it a mistake?\"\n\"Because,\" Cett said. \"You met the people inside. You talked with them, danced among them. Hell,"

Can't you see why that's such a problem? When the time comes to attack, you'll worry about\npeople you're going to hurt.\"\nElend rode in silence for a moment. The morning mists were a normal thing to him now. They\nobscured the camp, masking its size. Even to his tin-enhanced eyes, distant tents became silhouetted\nlumps. It was as if he rode through some mythical world, a place of muffled shadows and distant noises.\nHad it been a mistake for him to enter the city? Perhaps. Elend knew the theories Cett spoke of—he\nunderstood how important it was for a general to view his enemies not as individuals, but as numbers.\nObstacles.\n\"I'm glad for my choice,\" Elend said.\n\"I know,\" Cett said, scratching at his thick beard. \"That's what frustrates me, to be honest. You're a\ncompassionate man. That's a weakness, but it isn't the real problem. The problem is your inability to deal\nwith your own compassion.\"\nElend raised an eyebrow.\n\"You should know better than to let yourself grow attached to your enemy, Elend,\" Cett said. \"You\nshould have known how you would react, and planned so that you could avoid this very situation! Hell,\nboy, every leader has weaknesses—the ones who win are the ones who learn how to smother those\nweaknesses, not give them fuel!\" When Elend didn't respond to that, Cett simply sighed. \"All right, then,\nlet's talk about the siege. The engineers have blocked off several streams that lead into the city, but they\ndon't think those were the primary sources of water.\"\n\"They weren't,\" Elend said. \"Vin has located six main wells within the city itself.\"\n\"We should poison them,\" Cett said.\nElend fell silent. The two halves of him still warred inside. The man he had been just wanted to protect\nas many people as possible. The man he was becoming, however, was more realistic. It knew that\nsometimes he had to kill—or at least discomfort—in order to save.\n\"Very well,\" Elend said. \"I'll have Vin do it tonight—and I'll have her leave a message written on the\nwells saying what we've done.\"\n\"What good will that do?\" Cett asked, frowning.\n\"I don't want to kill the people, Cett,\" Elend said, \"I want to worry them. This way, they'll go to\nYomen for water. With the entire city making demands, he should go through the water supply in his\nstorage cache pretty quickly.\"\nCett grunted. He seemed pleased, however, that Elend had taken his suggestion. \"And the surrounding\nvillages?\"\n\"Feel free to bully them,\" Elend said. \"Organize a force of ten thousand, and send them out to\nharass—but not kill. I want Yomen's spies in the area to send him worried notes about his kingdom\ncollapsing.\"\n\"You're trying to play this halfway, lad,\" Cett said. \"Eventually, you'll have to choose. If Yomen doesn't\nsurrender, you'll have to attack.\""

If Yomen doesn't\nsurrender, you'll have to attack.\"\nElend reined in his horse outside the command tent. \"I know,\" he said softly.\nCett snorted, but he fell silent as servants came out of the tent to unstrap him from the saddle. As they\nstarted, however, the earth began to tremble. Elend cursed, struggling to maintain control of his horse as\nit grew skittish. The shaking rattled tents, knocking poles free and collapsing a couple of them, and Elend\nheard the clang of metal as cups, swords, and other items were knocked to the ground. Eventually, the\nrumbling subsided, and he glanced to the side, checking on Cett. The man had managed to keep control\nof his mount, though one of his useless legs swung free from the saddle, and he looked as if he was about\nto fall off. His servants rushed to his side to help.\n\"Damn things are growing more and more frequent,\" Cett said.\nElend calmed his horse, which stood puffing in the mists. Around the camp, men cursed and yelled,\ndealing with the aftermath of the earthquake. They were indeed growing more frequent; the last one had\nonly been a few weeks before. Earthquakes weren't supposed to be common in the Final\nEmpire—during his youth, he'd never heard of one happening in the inner dominances.\nHe sighed, climbing from his horse and handing the beast off to an aide, then followed Cett into the\ncommand tent. The servants sat Cett in a chair, then retreated, leaving the two of them alone. Cett\nglanced up at Elend, looking troubled. \"Did that fool Ham tell you about the news from Luthadel?\"\n\"Or the lack of it?\" Elend asked, sighing. \"Yes.\" Not a peep had come from the capital city, let alone\nthe supplies Elend had ordered brought down the canal.\n\"We don't have that much time, Elend,\" Cett said quietly. \"A few months, at most. Time enough to\nweaken Yomen's resolve, perhaps make his people get so thirsty that they begin to look forward to\ninvasion. But, if we don't get resupplied, there's no way we'll be able to maintain this siege.\"\nElend glanced at the older man. Cett sat in his chair with an arrogant expression, looking back at\nElend, meeting his eyes. So much about what the crippled man did was about posturing—Cett had lost\nthe use of his legs to disease long ago, and he couldn't intimidate people physically. So, he had to find\nother ways to make himself threatening.\nCett knew how to hit where it hurt. He could pick at the very faults that bothered people and exploit\ntheir virtues in ways that Elend had rarely seen even accomplished Soothers manage. And he did all this\nwhile covering up a heart that Elend suspected was far softer than Cett would ever admit.\nHe seemed particularly on edge this day. As if worried about something. Something important to\nhim—something he'd been forced to leave behind, perhaps?\n\"She'll be all right, Cett,\" Elend said. \"Nothing will happen to Allrianne while she's with Sazed and\nBreeze.\""

Let that Soother have her, I say!

He did still look pale. \"However, I have recovered enough\nstrength to move around a bit.\"\n\"The others?\" Elend asked.\nHam nodded. \"Mostly up and about as well. Demoux is among the last batch. A few more days, and\nthe army will be back to full strength.\"\nMinus those who died, Elend thought.\nCett eyed Demoux. \"Most of the men recovered weeks ago. A bit weaker in the constitution than one\nmight expect, eh, Demoux? That's what I've been hearing, at least.\"\nDemoux blushed.\nElend frowned at this. \"What?\"\n\"It is nothing, Your Majesty,\" Demoux said.\n\"It's never 'nothing' in my camp, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"What am I missing?\"\nHam sighed, pulling over a chair. He sat on it backward, resting his muscular arms across its back.\n\"It's just a rumor moving through the camp, El.\"\n\"Soldiers,\" Cett said. \"They're all the same—superstitious as housewives.\"\nHam nodded. \"Some of them have gotten it into their heads that the men who got sick from the mists\nwere being punished.\"\n\"Punished?\" Elend asked. \"For what?\"\n\"Lack of faith, Your Majesty,\" Demoux said.\n\"Nonsense,\" Elend said. \"We all know that the mists struck randomly.\"\nThe others shared looks, and Elend had to pause and reconsider. No. The strikes weren't random—\nat least, the statistics surrounding them weren't. \"Regardless,\" he said, deciding to change the subject,\n\"what are your daily reports?\"\nThe three men took turns talking about their various duties in the bivouac. Ham saw to morale and\ntraining, Demoux to supplies and camp duties, Cett to tactics and patrols. Elend stood with hands\nclasped behind his back, listening to the reports, but only with half an ear. They weren't much different\nfrom the previous day, though it was good to see Demoux back at his duties. He was far more efficient\nthan his assistants.\nAs they talked, Elend's mind wandered. The siege was going fairly well, but a part of him—the part\ntrained by Cett and Tindwyl—chafed at the waiting game. He might just be able to take the city straight\nout.

The rock formations would provide cover for the defenders, but Elend wasn't in so bad a\nposition that he couldn't win.\nBut doing so would cost many, many lives.\nThat was the step he balked at—the last step that would take him from defender to aggressor. From\nprotector to conqueror. And he was frustrated at his own hesitation.\nThere was another reason going into the city had been bad for Elend. It had been better for Elend to\nthink of Yomen as an evil tyrant, a corrupt obligator loyal to the Lord Ruler. Now, unfortunately, he\nknew Yomen to be a reasonable man. And one with very good arguments. In a way, his indictment of\nElend was true. Elend was a hypocrite. He spoke of democracy, yet he had taken his throne by force.\nIt was what the people had needed from him, he believed. But it did make him a hypocrite. Still, by\nthat same logic, he knew he should send Vin to assassinate Yomen. But, could Elend order the death of a\nman who had done nothing wrong besides getting in his way?\nAssassinating the obligator seemed as twisted an action as sending his koloss to attack the city. Cett is\nright, Elend thought. I'm trying to play both sides on this one. For a moment, while talking to Telden\nduring the ball, he had felt so sure of himself. And, in truth, he still believed what he'd claimed. Elend\nwasn't the Lord Ruler. He did give his people more freedom and more justice.\nHowever, he realized that this siege could tip the balance between who he was and who he feared he\nwould become. Could he really justify invading Fadrex, slaughtering its armies and pillaging its resources,\nall ostensibly in the name of protecting the people of the empire? Could he dare do the opposite: back\naway from Fadrex, and leave the secrets in that cavern—the secrets that could potentially save the entire\nempire—to a man who still thought the Lord Ruler would return to save his people?\nHe wasn't ready to decide. For now, he was determined to exhaust every other option. Anything that\nwould keep him from needing to invade the city. That included besieging the city to make Yomen more\npliant. That also included sneaking Vin into the storage cavern. Her reports indicated that the building\nwas very heavily guarded. She wasn't certain if she could get into it on an ordinary night. However,\nduring a ball, defenses might be more porous. It would be the perfect time to try to get a glimpse at what\nwas hidden in that cavern.\nAssuming Yomen hasn't simply removed the Lord Ruler's last inscription, Elend thought. Or that\nthere was even something there in the first place.\nYet, there was a chance. The Lord Ruler's final message, the last bit of help he had left for his people.\nIf Elend could find a way to get that help without breaking his way into the city, killing thousands, he\nwould take it.\nEventually, the men finished with their reports, and Elend dismissed them. Ham went quickly, wanting\nto get in on a morning sparring session. Cett was gone a few moments later, carried back to his own tent."

The balding scalp and numerous scars made the man look much older than he\nwas, as did the still-visible effects of his extended illness.\nDemoux was hesitant about something. Elend waited, and finally the man dropped his eyes, looking\nembarrassed. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"I feel that I must ask to be released from my post as general.\"\n\"And why do you say that?\" Elend asked carefully.\n\"I don't think I'm worthy of the position anymore.\"\nElend frowned.\n\"Only a man trusted by the Survivor should command in this army, my lord,\" Demoux said.\n\"I'm sure that he does trust you, Demoux.\"\nDemoux shook his head. \"Then why did he give me the sickness? Why pick me, of all the men in the\narmy?\"\n\"I've told you, it was random luck, Demoux.\"\n\"My lord,\" Demoux said, \"I hate to disagree, but we both know that isn't true. After all, you were the\none who pointed out that those who fell sick did so at Kelsier's will.\"\nElend paused. \"I did?\"\nDemoux nodded. \"On that morning when we exposed our army to the mists, you shouted out for them\nto remember that Kelsier is the Lord of the Mists, and that the sickness must—therefore—be his will. I\nthink you were right. The Survivor is Lord of the Mists. He proclaimed it so himself, during the nights\nbefore he died. He's behind the sickness, my lord. I know he is. He saw those who lacked faith, and he\ncursed them.\"\n\"That isn't what I meant, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"I was implying that Kelsier wanted us to suffer this\nsetback, but not that he was targeting specific individuals.\"\n\"Either way, my lord, you said the words.\"\nElend waved his hand dismissively.\n\"Then how do you explain the strange numbers, my lord?\" Demoux asked.\n\"I'm not sure,\" Elend said. \"I'll admit that the number of people who fell sick does produce an odd\nstatistic, but that doesn't say anything about you specifically, Demoux.\"\n\"I don't mean that number, my lord,\" Demoux said, still looking down. \"I mean the number who\nremained sick while the others recovered.\"\nElend paused. \"Wait. What is this?\"\n\"Haven't you heard, my lord?\" Demoux asked in the quiet tent. \"The scribes have been talking about it,\nand it's gotten around to the army. I don't think that most of them understand the numbers and such, but\nthey understand that something strange is happening.\"\n\"What numbers?\" Elend asked.\n\"Five thousand people got taken by the sickness, my lord,\" Demoux said.\nExactly sixteen percent of the army, Elend thought.\n\"Of those, some five hundred died,\" Demoux said. \"Of those remaining, almost everyone recovered in\none day.\"\n\"But some didn't,\" Elend said. \"Like you.\""

To the hour.\"\nThe tent flap rustled quietly in the breeze. Elend fell quiet, and couldn't completely suppress a shiver.\n\"Coincidence,\" he finally said. \"Statisticians looking for connections can always find odd coincidences\nand statistical anomalies, if they try hard enough.\"\n\"This doesn't seem like a simple anomaly, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"It's precise. The same number\nkeeps showing up, over and over. Sixteen.\"\nElend shook his head. \"Even if it does, Demoux, it doesn't mean anything. It's just a number.\"\n\"It's the number of months the Survivor spent in the Pits of Hathsin,\" Demoux said.\n\"Coincidence.\"\n\"It's how old Lady Vin was when she became Mistborn.\"\n\"Again, coincidence,\" Elend said.\n\"There seem to be an awful lot of coincidences related to this, my lord,\" Demoux said.\nElend frowned, folding his arms. Demoux was right on that point. My denials are getting us\nnowhere. I need to know what people are thinking, not just contradict them.\n\"All right, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"Let's say that none of these things are coincidences. You seem to\nhave a theory of what they mean.\"\n\"It's what I said earlier, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"The mists are of the Survivor. They take certain\npeople and kill them, others of us they make sick—leaving the number sixteen as a proof that he really\nwas behind the event. So, therefore, the people who grow the most sick are the ones who have\ndispleased him the most.\"\n\"Well, except for the ones who died from the sickness,\" Elend noted.\n\"True,\" Demoux said, looking up. \"So . . . maybe there's hope for me.\"\n\"That wasn't supposed to be a comforting comment, Demoux. I still don't accept all of this. Perhaps\nthere are oddities, but your interpretation is based on speculation. Why would the Survivor be displeased\nwith you? You're one of his most faithful priests.\"\n\"I took the position for myself, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"He didn't choose me. I just . . . started\nteaching what I'd seen, and people listened to me. That must be what I did to offend him. If he'd wanted\nthat from me, he'd have chosen me when he was alive, don't you think?\"\nI don't think the Survivor cared much about this when he was alive, Elend thought. He just\nwanted to stir up enough anger in the skaa that they would rebel.\n\"Demoux,\" Elend said, \"you know that the Survivor didn't organize this religion when he was alive.\nOnly men and women like you—those who looked toward his teachings after he died—have been able\nto build up a community of the faithful.\""

He had seen the general, worn and\ngrizzled beyond his age, determinedly stare down a savage koloss a full five feet taller than he was.\nDemoux was not a weak man, either in body or in faith.\n\"Demoux,\" Elend said, \"I mean this in the kindest way, but your self-pity is getting in the way. If these\nmists took you, then we need to use that as proof that their effects have nothing to do with Kelsier's\ndispleasure. We don't have time for you to question yourself right now—we both know you're twice as\ndevoted as any other man in this army.\"\nDemoux flushed.\n\"Think about it,\" Elend said, giving Demoux a little extra Allomantic shove in the emotions, \"in you, we\nhave obvious proof that a person's faithfulness has nothing to do with whether or not they're taken by the\nmists. So, rather than letting you mope, we need to move on and find the real reason the mists are\nbehaving as they are.\"\nDemoux stood for a moment, then finally nodded. \"Perhaps you're right, my lord. Maybe I'm jumping\nto conclusions.\"\nElend smiled. Then, he paused, thinking about his own words. Obvious proof that a person's\nfaithfulness has nothing to do with whether they're taken by the mists. . . .\nIt wasn't exactly true. Demoux was one of the strongest believers in the camp. What of the others who\nhad been sick as long as he? Had they been, perhaps, men of extreme faith as well? Elend opened his\nmouth to ask the question of Demoux. That was when the shouting started.\nHemalurgic decay was less obvious in Inquisitors that had been created from Mistborn. Since they\nalready had Allomantic powers, the addition of other abilities made them awesomely strong.\nIn most cases, however, Inquisitors were created from Mistings. It appears that Seekers, like\nMarsh, were the favored recruits. For, when a Mistborn wasn't available, an Inquisitor with\nenhanced bronze abilities was a powerful tool for searching out skaa Mistings.\n37\nSCREAMS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE. Vin started upright in her cabin. She hadn't been sleeping,\nthough she'd been close. Another night of scouting Fadrex City had left her tired.\nAll fatigue was forgotten, however, as the sounds of battle clanged from the north. Finally! she\nthought, throwing off her blankets and dashing from the cabin. She wore her standard trousers and shirt,\nand—as always—carried several vials of metals. She downed one of these as she scrambled across the\ndeck of the narrow-boat."

Several groups of men on horseback had ridden into the north\nsection of camp, and were apparently trying to make their way toward the supply barges, which floated\nin a well-protected bend in the canal. A group of Elend's Allomancers had set up a perimeter at one side,\nThugs in the front, Coinshots picking off the riders from behind. The regular soldiers held the middle,\nfighting well, since the horsemen were slowed by the camp's barricades and fortifications.\nElend was right, Vin thought with pride, descending through the air. If we hadn't exposed our men\nto the mists, we'd be in trouble right now.\nThe king's planning had saved their supplies and baited out one of Yomen's harrying forces. The riders\nhad probably expected to run easily through the camp—catching the soldiers unaware and trapped by\nmist—then set fire to the supply barges. Instead, Elend's scouts and patrols had provided enough\nwarning, and the enemy cavalry was bogged down in a head-on fight.\nYomen's soldiers were punching through into the camp on the south side. Though Elend's soldiers\nfought well, their enemies were mounted. Vin plunged down through the sky, flaring pewter and\nstrengthening her body. She tossed a coin, Pushing on it to slow herself, and hit the dark ground,\nthrowing up a huge spray of ash. The southern bank of riders had penetrated as far as the third line of\ntents. Vin chose to land right in the middle of them.\nNo horseshoes, Vin thought as soldiers began to turn toward her. And spears—stone-tipped—\ninstead of swords. Yomen certainly is careful.\nIt almost felt like a challenge. Vin smiled, the adrenaline feeling good after so many days spent waiting.\nYomen's captains began to call out, turning their attack toward Vin. In seconds, they had a force of some\nthirty riders galloping straight at her.\nVin stared them down. Then she jumped. She didn't need steel to get herself high—her\npewter-enhanced muscles were enough for that. She crested the lead soldier's spear, feeling it pass\nthrough the air beneath her. Ash swirled in the morning mists as Vin's foot took the soldier in the face,\nthrowing him backward from the saddle. She landed beside his rolling body, then dropped a coin and\nPushed herself to the side, out of the way of galloping hooves. The unfortunate rider she'd unhorsed cried\nout as his friends inadvertently trampled him.\nVin's Push carried her through the open flaps of a large canvas sleeping tent. She rolled to her feet,\nand then—still in motion—Pushed against the tent's metal stakes, ripping them from the ground."

She rolled to her feet,\nand then—still in motion—Pushed against the tent's metal stakes, ripping them from the ground.\nThe walls shook, and there was a snap of canvas as the tent shot upward into the air, spread taut as its\nstakes all went different directions. Ash blew outward from the burst of air, and soldiers on both sides of\nthe conflict turned toward Vin. She allowed the tent to fall down in front of her, then Pushed. The canvas\ncaught the air, puffing out, and the stakes ripped free from the tent, shooting forward to spear horses and\nriders.\nMen and beasts fell. Canvas fluttered to the ground before Vin. She smiled, then jumped over the\ndiscarded tangle as the riders tried to organize another assault. She didn't give them time. Elend's soldiers\nin the area had pulled back, shoring up the center of the defensive line, leaving Vin free to attack without\nfear of harming her own men.\nShe dashed between the horsemen, their massive mounts hindering them as they tried to keep track of\nher. Men and horses spun, and Vin Pulled, tearing tents out of the ground and using their metal stakes\nlike arrows. Dozens fell before her.\nThe sound of galloping came from behind, and Vin spun to see that one of the enemy officers had\nmanaged to organize another charge. Ten men came straight at her, some with spears leveled, others\ndrawing bows.\nVin didn't like killing. But she loved Allomancy—loved the challenge of using her skills, the strength\nand thrill of the Pushes and Pulls, the electric sense of power that came only from a body flared with\npewter. When men such as these gave her an excuse to fight, she didn't restrain herself.\nThe arrows didn't have a chance against her. Pewter gave her speed and balance as she spun out of\nthe way, Pulling on a metal source behind her. She jumped into the air as a rippling tent passed beneath\nher, carried forward by her Pull a moment before. She landed, then Pushed on several of its stakes—a\ncouple on each of two tent corners. The tent folded upon itself, looking a bit like a napkin with someone\npulling tightly on opposite corners.\nAnd this hit the legs of the horses like a tripwire. Vin burned duralumin, then Pushed. The horses in\nfront screamed, the improvised weapon scattering them to the ground. The canvas ripped, and the stakes\npulled free, but the damage was done—those in front tripped those behind, and men tumbled beside their\nbeasts.\nVin downed another vial to replenish her steel. Then she Pulled, whipping another tent toward her. As\nit grew close, she jumped, then spun and Pushed the tent toward another group of mounted men behind.\nThe tent's stakes struck one of the soldiers in the chest, throwing him backward. He crashed through the\nother soldiers, causing chaos.\nThe man hit the ground, slumping lifeless into the ash.

She stepped forward, intending to chase them down, but\nstopped. Someone was watching her—she could see his shadow in the mist. She burned bronze.\nThe figure thumped with the power of metals. Allomancer. Mistborn. He was far too short to be\nElend, but she couldn't tell much more than that through the shadow of mist and ash. Vin didn't pause to\nthink. She dropped a coin and shot herself toward the stranger.\nHe leaped backward, Pushing himself into the air as well. Vin followed, quickly leaving the camp\nbehind, bounding after the Allomancer. He quickly made his way to the city, and she followed, moving in\nvast leaps over an ashen landscape. Her quarry crested the rock formations at the front of the city, and\nVin followed, landing just a few feet from a surprised guard patrol, then launching herself over crags and\nwindswept rocks into Fadrex proper.\nThe other Allomancer stayed ahead of her. There was no playfulness to his motions, as there had been\nwith Zane. This man was really trying to escape. Vin followed, now leaping over rooftops and streets.\nShe gritted her teeth, frustrated at her inability to catch up. She timed each jump perfectly, barely pausing\nas she chose new anchors and Pushed herself from arc to arc.\nYet, he was good. He rounded the city, forcing her to push herself to keep up. Fine! she finally\nthought, then prepared her duralumin. She'd gotten close enough to the figure that he was no longer\nshadowed in mist, and she could see that he was real and corporeal, not some phantom spirit. She was\nincreasingly certain that this was the man she'd sensed watching her when she'd first come into Fadrex.\nYomen had a Mistborn.\nHowever, to fight the man, she'd first need to catch him. She waited for the right moment, just when he\nwas beginning to crest one of his arcing jumps, then extinguished her metals and burned duralumin. Then\nshe Pushed.\nA crash sounded behind her as her unnatural Push shattered the door she'd used as an anchor. She\nwas thrown forward with a terrible burst of speed, like an arrow released from a bow. She approached\nher opponent with awesome speed.\nAnd found nothing. Vin cursed, turning her tin back on. She couldn't leave it on while burning\nduralumin—otherwise, her tin would burn away in a single flash, leaving her blinded. But, she'd effectively\ndone the same thing by turning it off. She Pulled herself down from her duralumin Push to land maladroitly\natop a nearby roof. She crouched as she scanned the misty air.\nWhere did you go? she thought, burning bronze, trusting in her innate—yet still unexplained—ability to\npierce copperclouds to reveal her opponent. No Allomancer could hide from Vin unless he completely\nturned off his metals.\nWhich, apparently this man had done. Again. This was the second time he'd eluded her.\nIt bespoke a disquieting possibility. Vin had tried very hard to keep her ability to pierce copperclouds"

Vin had tried very hard to keep her ability to pierce copperclouds\na secret, but it had been nearly four years since her discovery of it. Zane had known about it, and she\ncouldn't know who else had guessed, based on things she could do. Her secret could very well be out.\nVin remained on that rooftop for a few moments, but knew she'd find nothing. A man clever enough to\nescape her at the exact moment when her tin was down would also be clever enough to remain hidden\nuntil she was gone. In fact, it made her wonder why he had let her see him in the first . . .\nVin stood bolt upright, then downed a metal vial and Pushed herself off the rooftop, jumping with a\nfurious anxiety back toward the camp.\nShe found the soldiers cleaning up the wreckage and bodies at the camp's perimeter. Elend was\nmoving among them calling out orders, congratulating the men, and generally letting himself be seen.\nIndeed, sight of his white-clothed form immediately brought Vin a sense of relief.\nShe landed beside him. \"Elend, were you attacked?\"\nHe glanced at her. \"What? Me? No, I'm fine.\"\nThen the Allomancer wasn't sent to distract me from an attack on Elend, she thought, frowning.\nIt had seemed so obvious. It—\nElend pulled her aside, looking worried. \"I'm fine, Vin, but there's something else—something's\nhappened.\"\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\nElend shook his head. \"I think this all was just a distraction—the entire attack on the camp.\"\n\"But, if they weren't after you,\" Vin said, \"and they weren't after our supplies, then what was there to\ndistract us from?\"\nElend met her eyes. \"The koloss.\"\n\"How did we miss this?\" Vin asked, sounding frustrated.\nElend stood with a troop of soldiers on a plateau, waiting as Vin and Ham inspected the burned siege\nequipment. Down below, he could see Fadrex City, and his own army camped outside it. The mists had\nretreated a short time ago. It was disturbing that from this distance he couldn't even make out the\ncanal—the falling ash had darkened its waters and covered the landscape to the point that everything just\nlooked black.\nAt the base of the plateau's cliffs lay the remnants of their koloss army. Twenty thousand had become\nten thousand in a few brief moments as a well-laid trap had rained down destruction on the beasts while\nElend's troops were distracted. The daymists had kept his men from seeing what was going on until it\nwas too late. Elend himself had felt the deaths, but had misinterpreted them as koloss sensing the battle.\n\"Caves in the back of those cliffs,\" Ham said, poking at a bit of charred wood. \"Yomen probably had\nthe trebuchets stored in the caves in anticipation of our arrival, though I'd guess they were originally being\nbuilt for an assault on Luthadel. Either way, this plateau was a perfect staging area for a barrage. I'd say\nYomen set them up here intending to attack our army, but when we camped the koloss just beneath the\nplateau . . .\""

The falling rocks had done a lot of\ndamage. And then the creatures had slipped away from him. Their frustration had been too powerful, and\nfor a time, he hadn't been able to keep them from turning on each other. Most of the deaths had come as\nthe koloss attacked each other. Roughly one of every two had died as they had paired off and killed each\nother.\nI lost control of them, he thought. It had only been for a short while, and it had only happened\nbecause they hadn't been able to get at their enemies. However, it set a dangerous precedent.\nVin, frustrated, kicked a large chunk of burned wood, sending it tumbling down the side of the plateau.\n\"This was a very well-planned attack, El,\" Ham said, speaking in a soft voice. \"Yomen must have seen\nus sending out extra patrols in the mornings, and correctly guessed that we were expecting an attack\nduring those hours. So, he gave us one—then hit us where we should have been the strongest.\"\n\"It cost him a lot, though,\" Elend said. \"He had to burn his own siege equipment to keep it away from\nus, and he has to have lost hundreds of soldiers—plus their mounts—in the attack on our camp.\"\n\"True,\" Ham said. \"But would you trade a couple dozen siege weapons and five hundred men for ten\nthousand koloss? Plus, Yomen has to be worried about keeping that cavalry mobile—the Survivor only\nknows where he got enough grain to feed those horses as long as he did. Better for him to strike now and\nlose them in battle than to have them starve.\"\nElend nodded slowly. This makes things more difficult. With ten thousand fewer koloss . . .\nSuddenly, the forces were much more evenly matched. Elend could maintain his siege, but storming the\ncity would be far more risky.\nHe sighed. \"We shouldn't have left the koloss so far outside of the main camp. We'll have to move\nthem in.\"\nHam didn't seem to like that.\n\"They're not dangerous,\" Elend said. \"Vin and I can control them.\" Mostly.\nHam shrugged. He moved back through the smoking wreckage, preparing to send messengers. Elend\nwalked forward, approaching Vin, who stood at the very edge of the cliff. Being up so high still made him\na bit uncomfortable. Yet, she barely even noticed the sheer drop in front of her.\n\"I should have been able to help you regain control of them,\" she said quietly, staring out into the\ndistance. \"Yomen distracted me.\"\n\"He distracted us all,\" Elend said. \"I felt the koloss in my head, but even so, I couldn't figure out what\nwas going on. I'd regained control of them by the time you got back, but by then, a lot of them were\ndead.\"\n\"Yomen has a Mistborn,\" Vin said.\n\"You're sure?\"\nVin nodded.\nOne more thing, he thought. He contained his frustration, however. His men needed to see him"

His men needed to see him\nconfident. \"I'm giving a thousand of the koloss to you,\" he said. \"We should have split them up earlier.\"\n\"You're stronger,\" Vin said.\n\"Not strong enough, apparently.\"\nVin sighed, then nodded. \"Let me go down below.\" They'd found that proximity helped with taking\ncontrol of koloss.\n\"I'll pull off a section of a thousand or so, then let go. Be ready to grab them as soon as I do.\"\nVin nodded, then stepped off the side of the plateau.\nI should have realized that I was getting caught up in the excitement of the fighting, Vin thought as\nshe fell through the air. It seemed so obvious to her now. And, unfortunately, the results of the attack left\nher feeling even more pent-up and anxious than she had before.\nShe tossed a coin and landed. Even a drop of several hundred feet didn't bother her anymore. It was\nodd to think about. She remembered timidly standing atop the Luthadel city wall, afraid to use her\nAllomancy to jump off, despite Kelsier's coaxing. Now she could step off a cliff and muse thoughtfully to\nherself on the way down.\nShe walked across the powdery ground. The ash came up to the top of her calves and would have\nbeen difficult to walk in without pewter to give her strength. The ashfalls were growing increasingly dense.\nHuman approached her almost immediately. She couldn't tell if the koloss was simply reacting to their\nbond, or if he was actually aware and interested enough to pick her out. He had a new wound on his\narm, a result of the fighting. He fell into step beside her as she moved up to the other koloss, his massive\nform obviously having no trouble with the deep ash.\nAs usual, there was very little emotion to the koloss camp. Just a short time before, they had been\nscreaming in bloodlust, attacking each other as stones crashed down from above. Now they simply sat in\nthe ash, gathered in small groups, ignoring their wounds. They would have had fires going if there had\nbeen wood available. Some few dug, finding handfuls of dirt to chew on.\n\"Don't your people care, Human?\" Vin asked.\nThe massive koloss looked down at her, ripped face bleeding slightly. \"Care?\"\n\"That so many of you died,\" Vin said. She could see corpses lying about, forgotten in the ash save for\nthe ritual flaying that was the koloss form of burial. Several koloss still worked, moving between bodies,\nripping off the skin.\n\"We take care of them,\" Human said.\n\"Yes,\" Vin said. \"You pull their skin off. Why do you do that, anyway?\"\n\"They are dead,\" Human said, as if that were enough of an explanation.\nTo the side, a large group of koloss stood up, commanded by Elend's silent orders. They separated\nthemselves from the main camp, trudging out into the ash. A moment later, they began to look around, no\nlonger moving as one.\nVin reacted quickly. She turned off her metals, burned duralumin, then flared zinc in a massive Pull,"

As expected, they snapped under her control, just as Human was.\nControlling this many was more difficult, but still well within her abilities. Vin ordered them to be calm,\nand to not kill, then let them return to the camp. From now on, they would remain in the back of her\nmind, no longer requiring Allomancy to manipulate. They were easy to ignore unless their passions grew\nstrong.\nHuman watched them. \"We are . . . fewer,\" he finally said.\nVin started. \"Yes,\" she said. \"You can tell that?\"\n\"I . . .\" Human trailed off, beady little eyes watching his camp. \"We fought. We died. We need more.\nWe have too many swords.\" He pointed in the distance, to a large pile of metal. Wedge-shaped koloss\nswords that no longer had owners.\nYou can control a koloss population through the swords, Elend had once told her. They fight to\nget bigger swords as they grow. Extra swords go to the younger, smaller koloss.\nBut nobody knows where those come from.\n\"You need koloss to use those swords, Human,\" Vin said.\nHuman nodded.\n\"Well,\" she said. \"You'll need to have more children, then.\"\n\"Children?\"\n\"More,\" Vin said. \"More koloss.\"\n\"You need to give us more,\" Human said, looking at her.\n\"Me?\"\n\"You fought,\" he said, pointing at her shirt. There was blood there, not her own.\n\"Yes, I did,\" Vin said.\n\"Give us more.\"\n\"I don't understand,\" Vin said. \"Please, just show me.\"\n\"I can't,\" Human said, shaking his head as he spoke in his slow tone. \"It's not right.\"\n\"Wait,\" Vin said. \"Not right?\" It was the first real statement of values she'd gotten from a koloss.\nHuman looked at her, and she could see consternation on his face. So, Vin gave him an Allomantic\nnudge. She didn't know exactly what to ask him to do, and that made her control of him weaker. Yet,\nshe Pushed him to do as he was thinking, trusting—for some reason—that his mind was fighting with his\ninstincts.\nHe screamed.\nVin backed away, shocked, but Human didn't attack her. He ran into the koloss camp, a massive blue\nmonster on two legs, kicking up ash. Others backed away from him—not out of fear, for they wore their\ncharacteristic impassive faces. They simply appeared to have enough sense to stay out of the way of an\nenraged koloss of Human's size.\nVin followed carefully as Human approached one of the dead bodies of a koloss who still wore his\nskin. Human didn't rip the skin off, however, but flung the corpse over his shoulder and took off running\ntoward Elend's camp.\nUh, oh, Vin thought, dropping a coin and taking to the air. She bounded after Human, careful not to\noutpace him. She considered ordering him back, but did not. He was acting unusually, true, but that was\na good thing. Koloss generally didn't do anything unusual. They were predictable to a fault."

Vin stayed with him, keeping the soldiers away.\nHuman paused in the middle of camp, a bit of his passion wearing off. Vin nudged him again. After\nlooking about, Human took off toward the broken section of camp, where Yomen's soldiers had\nattacked.\nVin followed, growing more and more curious. Human hadn't taken out his sword. Indeed, he didn't\nseem angry at all, just . . . intense. He arrived at a section where tents had fallen and men had died. The\nbattle was still only a few hours old, and soldiers moved about, cleaning up. Triage tents had been set up\njust beside the battlefield. Human headed for those.\nVin rushed ahead, cutting him off just as he reached the tent with the wounded. \"Human,\" she said\nwarily. \"What are you doing?\"\nHe ignored her, slamming the dead koloss down on the ground. Now, finally, Human ripped the skin\noff the corpse. It came off easily—this was one of the smaller koloss, whose skin hung in folds, far too\nlarge for its body.\nHuman pulled the skin free, causing several of the watching guards to groan in disgust. Vin watched\nclosely despite the stomach-wrenching sight. She felt like she was on the verge of understanding\nsomething very important.\nHuman reached down, and pulled something out of the koloss corpse.\n\"Wait,\" Vin said, stepping forward. \"What was that?\"\nHuman ignored her. He pulled out something else, and this time Vin caught a flash of bloodied metal.\nShe followed his fingers as he moved, and this time saw the item before he pulled it free and hid it in his\npalm.\nA spike. A small metal spike driven into the side of the dead koloss. There was a rip of blue skin\nbeside the spikehead, as if . . .\nAs if the spikes were holding the skin in place, Vin thought. Like nails holding cloth to a wall.\nSpikes. Spikes like . . .\nHuman retrieved a fourth spike, then stepped forward into the tent. Surgeons and soldiers moved\nback in fear, crying out for Vin to do something as Human approached the bed of a wounded soldier.\nHuman looked from one unconscious man to another, then reached for one of them.\nStop! Vin commanded in her mind.\nHuman froze in place. Only then did the complete horror of what was happening occur to her. \"Lord\nRuler,\" she whispered. \"You were going to turn them into koloss, weren't you? That's where you come\nfrom. That's why there are no koloss children.\"\n\"I am human,\" the large beast said quietly.\nHemalurgy can be used to steal Allomantic or Feruchemical powers and give them to another\nperson. However, a Hemalurgic spike can also be created by killing a normal person, one who is\nneither an Allomancer nor a Feruchemist. In that case, the spike instead steals the very power of\nPreservation existing within the soul of the people. (The power that, in fact, gives all people\nsentience.)"

It had become such a pale,\ntranslucent thing to him. Nearly invisible. Stars in the sky blazed like a million limelights shining down on\nhim. It was a beauty only he could see.\nHe turned, looking across the burned remains of the building. Skaa workers carefully sifted through the\nmess. It was hard for Spook to remember that they couldn't see well in the night's darkness. He had to\nkeep them packed closely together, working as much by touch as by sight.\nThe scent was, of course, terrible. Yet, burning pewter seemed to help mitigate that. Perhaps the\nstrength it gave him extended to his ability to avoid unintentional reactions, such as retching or coughing.\nDuring his youth, he had wondered about the pairing of tin and pewter. Other Allomantic pairs were\nopposites—steel Pushed on metals, iron Pulled on them. Copper hid Allomancers, bronze revealed\nAllomancers. Zinc enflamed emotions, brass depressed them. Yet, tin and pewter didn't seem\nopposites—one enhanced the body, the other the senses.\nAnd yet, these were opposites. Tin made his sense of touch so sharp that each step had once been\nuncomfortable. Pewter enhanced his body, making it resistant to pain—and so as he picked his way\nacross the blackened ruin, his feet didn't hurt as much. In a similar way, where light had once blinded him,\npewter let him endure far more before needing his blindfold.\nThe two were opposites, yet complements—just like the other pairs of Allomantic metals. He felt\nright having the one to go with the other. How had he survived without pewter? He had been a man with\nonly one half of an ability. Now he was complete.\nAnd yet, he did wonder what it would be like to have the other powers too. Kelsier had given him\npewter. Could he, perhaps, bless Spook with iron and steel as well?\nA man directed the line of working figures. His name was Franson; he was the one who had asked\nSpook to rescue his sister.

He'd shared the\ninformation he'd gleaned with Sazed and Breeze, and they'd seemed appreciative. However, with the\nincreased security around the Citizen's home, they'd suggested that it was foolhardy to risk more spying\nuntil they'd figured out their plans for the city. Spook had accepted their guidance, though he felt himself\ngrowing anxious. He missed going to see Beldre, the quiet girl with the lonely eyes.\nHe didn't know her. He couldn't fool himself that he did. Yet, when they'd met and spoken that once,\nshe hadn't screamed or betrayed him. She'd seemed intrigued by him. That was a good sign, right?\nFool, he thought. She's the Citizen's own sister! Talking to her nearly got you killed. Focus on\nthe task at hand.\nSpook watched the work for a time longer. Finally, Franson—dirty and exhausted in the\nstarlight—approached him. \"My lord,\" Franson said, \"we've gone over this section four times now. The\nmen in the basement pit have moved all the debris and ash to the sides, and have sifted through it twice.\nWhatever we were going to find, we've found it.\"\nSpook nodded. Franson was probably right. Spook removed a small pouch from his pocket, handing\nit to Franson. It clinked, and the large skaa man raised an eyebrow.\n\"Payment,\" Spook said, \"for the other men. They've worked here for three nights.\"\n\"They're friends, my lord,\" he said. \"They just want to see my sister rescued.\"\n\"Pay them anyway,\" Spook said. \"And tell them to spend the coins on food and supplies as soon as\nthey can—before Quellion abolishes coinage in the city.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Franson said. Then, he glanced to the side, where a mostly burned banister still stood\nupright. This is where the workers had placed the objects they had located in the wreckage: nine human\nskulls. They cast eerie shadows in the starlight. Leering, burned, and blackened.\n\"My lord,\" Franson said. \"May I ask the point of this?\"\n\"I watched this building burn down,\" Spook said. \"I was there when these poor people were herded\ninto the mansion, then locked inside. I couldn't do anything.\"\n\"I'm . . . sorry, my lord,\" Franson said.\nSpook shook his head. \"It's past now. However, there is something their deaths can teach us.\"\n\"My lord?\"\nSpook regarded the skulls. The day Spook had watched this building burn—the first time he had\nwitnessed one of the Citizen's executions—Durn had told him something. Spook had wanted information\nabout the Citizen's weaknesses, something to help him beat the man. Durn had only said one thing in\nresponse to this.\nCount the skulls.\nSpook had never had the chance to investigate that tip. He knew Durn would probably explain himself\nif pushed, but they both seemed to understand something important. Spook needed to see it for himself.\nHe needed to know what the Citizen was doing."

And, Quellion has broken it down in little\nover a year.\"\n\"Oh, I think the wine and beer probably did the breaking,\" Breeze noted. \"You'd be surprised at what\nmen will go through in order to get themselves properly intoxicated.\"\nSazed eyed Breeze's own cup—the man had taken quite a liking to the skaa bars, despite the fact that\nhe was forced to wear very mundane clothing. Of course, the clothing probably wasn't necessary\nanymore. If the city had even a halfway decent rumor mill, people would have already connected Breeze\nto the visitors who had met with Quellion a few days before. And, now that Sazed had come to the bar,\nany suspicions would have been confirmed. There was no way to hide Sazed's identity. His nationality\nwas obvious. He was too tall, too bald, and he had the typical Terris long face with drooping features\nand earlobes stretched out by the application of numerous earrings.\nThe time for anonymity had passed, though Breeze had used it well. During the few days when people\nhadn't known who he was, he'd managed to build both goodwill and contacts in the local underground.\nNow, he and Sazed could sit and enjoy a quiet drink without really drawing much attention. Breeze\nwould, of course, be Soothing the people to ensure that—but, even so, Sazed was impressed. For one\nas fond of high society as Breeze, the man did a remarkable job of relating to ordinary skaa workers.\nA group of men laughed at the next table, and Breeze smiled, then stood and made his way over to\njoin them. Sazed remained where he was, a mug of untouched wine on the table before him. In his\nopinion, there was an obvious reason why the skaa were no longer afraid to go out in the mists. Their\nsuperstitions had been overcome by something stronger: Kelsier. The one they were now calling the Lord\nof the Mists."

The one they were now calling the Lord\nof the Mists.\nThe Church of the Survivor had spread much further than Sazed had expected. It wasn't organized the\nsame way in Urteau as in Luthadel, and the focus seemed to be different, but the fact remained that men\nwere worshipping Kelsier. In fact, the differences were part of what made the whole phenomenon\nfascinating.\nWhat am I missing? Sazed thought. What is the connection here?\nThe mists killed. Yet, these people went out in the mists. Why weren't the people terrified of them?\nThis is not my problem, Sazed told himself. I need to remain focused. I've let my studies of the\nreligions in my portfolio lapse. He was getting close to being finished, and that worried him. So far,\nevery single religion had proven full of inconsistencies, contradictions, and logical flaws. He was growing\nmore and more worried that, even among the hundreds of religions in his metalminds, he would never be\nable to find the truth.\nA wave from Breeze distracted him. So, Sazed stood—forcing himself not to show the despair he\nfelt—and moved over to the table. The men there made room.\n\"Thank you,\" Sazed said, sitting.\n\"You forgot your cup, friend Terrisman,\" one of the men pointed out.\n\"I apologize,\" Sazed said. \"I have never been one fond of intoxicants. Please, do not take offense.\nYour thoughtful gift was nevertheless appreciated.\"\n\"Does he always talk like that?\" one of the men asked, looking at Breeze.\n\"You've never known a Terrismen, have you?\" asked another.\nSazed flushed, to which Breeze chuckled, laying a hand on Sazed's shoulder. \"All right, gentlemen. I've\nbrought you the Terrisman, as requested. Go ahead, ask your questions.\"\nThere were six local men at the table—all mine workers, from what Sazed could tell. One of the men\nleaned forward, hands clasped in front of him, knuckles scarred by rock. \"Breeze here says a lot of\nthings,\" the man said in a low voice. \"But people like him always make promises. Quellion said a lot of\nthe same things a year ago, when he was taking control after Straff Venture left.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed. \"I can understand your skepticism.\"\n\"But,\" the man said, raising a hand. \"Terrismen don't lie. They're good people. Everyone knows\nthat—lords, skaa, thieves, and obligators.\"\n\"So, we wanted to talk to you,\" another of the men said. \"Maybe you're different; maybe you'll lie to\nus. But, better to hear it from a Terrisman than a Soother.\"\nBreeze blinked, revealing just a faint hint of surprise. Apparently, he hadn't realized they'd been aware\nof his abilities.\n\"Ask your questions,\" Sazed said.\n\"Why did you come to this city?\" one of the men asked.\n\"To take control of it,\" Sazed said.\n\"Why do you care?\" another asked. \"Why does Venture's son even want Urteau?\"\n\"Two reasons,\" Sazed said. \"First, because of the resources it offers.

I cannot go into details, but\nsuffice it to say that your city is very desirable for economic reasons. The second reason, however, is\nequally important. Lord Elend Venture is one of the best men I have ever known. He believes he can do\nbetter for this people than the current government.\"\n\"That wouldn't be hard,\" one of the men grumbled.\nAnother man shook his head. \"What? You want to give the city back to the Ventures? One year, and\nyou've forgotten the things that Straff used to do in this city?\"\n\"Elend Venture is not his father,\" Sazed said. \"He is a man worthy of being followed.\"\n\"And the Terris people?\" one of the skaa asked. \"Do they follow him?\"\n\"In a way,\" Sazed said. \"Once, my people tried to rule themselves, as your people now do. However,\nthey realized the advantages of an alliance. My people have moved to the Central Dominance, and they\naccept the protection of Elend Venture.\" Of course, Sazed thought, they'd rather follow me. If I would\nbe their king.\nThe table fell silent.\n\"I don't know,\" one of the men said. \"What business do we have even talking about this? I mean,\nQuellion is in charge, and these strangers don't have an army to take his throne away from him. What's\nthe point?\"\n\"The Lord Ruler fell to us when we had no army,\" Breeze pointed out, \"and Quellion himself seized the\ngovernment from noble rule. Change can occur.\"\n\"We're not trying to form an army or rebellion,\" Sazed quickly added. \"We just want you to start . . .\nthinking. Talking with your friends. You are obviously influential men. Perhaps if Quellion hears of\ndiscontent among his people, he will begin to change his ways.\"\n\"Maybe,\" one of the men said.\n\"We don't need these outsiders,\" the other man repeated. \"The Survivor of the Flames has come to\ndeal with Quellion.\"\nSazed blinked. Survivor of the Flames? He caught a sly smile on Breeze's lips—the Soother had\napparently heard the term before, and now he appeared to be watching Sazed for a reaction.\n\"The Survivor doesn't enter into this,\" one of the men said. \"I can't believe we're even thinking of\nrebellion. Most of the world is in chaos, if you hear the reports! Shouldn't we just be happy with what\nwe've got?\"\nThe Survivor? Sazed thought. Kelsier? But, they seem to have given him a new title. Survivor of\nthe Flames?\n\"You're starting to twitch, Sazed,\" Breeze whispered. \"You might as well just ask. No harm in asking,\nright?\"\nNo harm in asking.\n\"The . . . Survivor of the Flames?\" Sazed asked. \"Why do you call Kelsier that?\"\n\"Not Kelsier,\" one of the men said. \"The other Survivor. The new one.\"\n\"The Survivor of Hathsin came to overthrow the Lord Ruler,\" one of the men said. \"So, can't we\nassume the Survivor of the Flames has come to overthrow Quellion?

There will\nbe executions near Marketpit. Be there.\"\nEven now, I can barely grasp the scope of all this. The events surrounding the end of the world\nseem even larger than the Final Empire and the people within it. I sense shards of something from\nlong ago, a fractured presence, something spanning the void.\nI have delved and searched, and have only been able to come up with a single name:\nAdonasium. Who, or what, it was, I do not yet know.\n39\nTENSOON SAT ON HIS HAUNCHES. Horrified.\nAsh rained down like shards of a broken sky, floating, making the very air look pocked and sickly.\nEven where he sat, atop a windswept hill, there was a layer of ash smothering the plant life. Some trees\nhad branches broken by the weight of repeated ash pileups.\nHow could they not see? he thought. How can they hide in their hole of a Homeland, content to\nlet the land above die?\nYet, TenSoon had lived for hundreds of years, and a part of him understood the tired complacency of\nthe First and Second Generations. At times he'd felt the same thing himself. A desire to simply wait. To\nspend years idly, content in the Homeland. He'd seen the outside world—seen more of it than any human\nor koloss would ever know. What need had he of experiencing more?\nThe Seconds had seen him as more orthodox and obedient than his brethren, all because he had\ncontinually wanted to leave the Homeland and serve Contracts. The Second Generation had always\nmisunderstood him. TenSoon hadn't served out of a desire to be obedient. He'd done it out of fear: fear\nthat he'd become content and apathetic like the Seconds and begin to think that the outside world didn't\nmatter to the kandra people.\nHe shook his head, then rose to all fours and loped off down the side of the hill, scattering ash into the\nair with each bound. As frightening as things had gotten, he was happy for one thing. The wolfhound's\nbody felt good on him. There was such a power in it—a capacity for movement—that no human form\ncould match. It was almost as if this were the form he always should have worn. What better body for a\nkandra with an incurable wanderlust? A kandra who had left his Homeland behind more often than any\nother, serving under the hated hands of human masters, all because of his fear of complacency?"

        "text": "kandra with an incurable wanderlust? A kandra who had left his Homeland behind more often than any\nother, serving under the hated hands of human masters, all because of his fear of complacency?\nHe made his way through the thin forest cover, over hills, hoping that the blanket of ash wouldn't make\nit too difficult for him to navigate. The falling ash did affect the kandra people—it affected them greatly.\nThey had legends about this exact event. What good was the First Contract, what good was the waiting,\nthe protection of the Trust? To most of the kandra, apparently, these things had become a point unto\nthemselves.\nYet, these things meant something. They had an origin. TenSoon hadn't been alive back then.\nHowever, he had known the First Generation and been raised by the Second. He grew up during days\nwhen the First Contract—the Trust, the Resolution—had been more than just words. The First Contract\nwas a set of instructions. Actions to take when the world began to fall. Not just ceremony, and not just\nmetaphor. He knew that its contents frightened some of the kandra. For them, it was better that the First\nContract be a philosophical, abstract thing—for if it were still concrete, still relevant, it would require\ngreat sacrifices of them.\nTenSoon stopped running; he was up to his wolfhound knees in deep black ash. The location looked\nvaguely familiar. He turned south, moving through a small rocky hollow—the stones now just dark\nlumps—looking for a place he had been over a year before. A place he'd visited after he had turned\nagainst Zane, his master, and left Luthadel to return to the Homeland.\nHe scrambled up a few rocks, then rounded the side of a stone outcrop, knocking lumps of ash off\nwith his passing. They broke apart as they fell, throwing more flakes into the air.\nAnd there it was. The hollow in rock, the place where he had stopped a year before. He remembered\nit, despite how the ash had transformed the landscape. The Blessing of Presence, serving him again. How\nwould he get along without it?\nI would not be sentient without it, he thought, smiling grimly. It was the bestowing of a Blessing on a\nmistwraith that brought the creature to wakefulness and true life. Each kandra got one of the four:\nPresence, Potency, Stability, or Awareness. It didn't matter which one a kandra gained; any of the four\nwould give him or her sentience, changing the mistwraith into a fully conscious kandra.\nIn addition to sentience, each Blessing gave something else. A power. But there were stories of kandra\nwho had gained more than one by taking them from others.\nTenSoon stuck a paw into the depression, digging out the ash, working to uncover the things he had\nhidden a year before. He found them quickly, rolling one—then the other—out onto the rock shelf in\nfront of him. Two small, polished iron spikes. It took two spikes to form a single Blessing. TenSoon\ndidn't know why this was. It was simply the way of things.\nTenSoon lay down, commanding the skin of his shoulder to part, and absorbed the spikes into his\nbody. He moved them through muscles and ligaments—dissolving several organs, then re-forming them\nwith the spikes piercing them."

His body became stronger. It was more than the simple\nadding of muscles—he could do that by re-forming his body. No, this gave each muscle an extra innate\nstrength, making them work much better, much more powerfully, than they would have otherwise.\nThe Blessing of Potency. He'd stolen the two spikes from OreSeur's body. Without this Blessing,\nTenSoon would never have been able to follow Vin as he had during their year together. It more than\ndoubled the power and endurance of each muscle. He couldn't regulate or change the level of that added\nstrength—this was not Feruchemy or Allomancy, but something different. Hemalurgy.\nA person had died to create each spike. TenSoon tried not to think about that too much; just as he\ntried not to think about how he only had this Blessing because he had killed one of his own generation.\nThe Lord Ruler had provided the spikes each century, giving the number requested, so that the kandra\ncould craft a new generation.\nHe now had four spikes, two Blessings, and was one of the most powerful kandra alive. His muscles\nstrengthened, TenSoon jumped confidently from the top of the rock formation, falling some twenty feet to\nland safely on the ash-covered ground below. He took off, running far more quickly now. The Blessing of\nPotency resembled the power of an Allomancer burning pewter, but it was not the same. It would not\nkeep TenSoon moving indefinitely, nor could he flare it for an extra burst of power. On the other hand, it\nrequired no metals to fuel it.\nHe made his path eastward. The First Contract was very explicit. When Ruin returned, the kandra\nwere to seek out the Father to serve him. Unfortunately, the Father was dead. The First Contract didn't\ntake that possibility into consideration. So—unable to go to the Father—TenSoon did the next best thing.\nHe went looking for Vin.\nOriginally, we assumed that a koloss was a combination of two people into one. That was wrong.\nKoloss are not the melding of two people, but five, as evidenced by the four spikes needed to\nmake them. Not five bodies, of course, but five souls.\nEach pair of spikes grants what the kandra would call the Blessing of Potency. However, each\nspike also distorts the koloss body a little more, making it increasingly inhuman. Such is the cost\nof Hemalurgy.\n40\n\"NOBODY KNOWS PRECISELY how Inquisitors are made,\" Elend said from the front of the tent,\naddressing a small group, which included Ham, Cett, the scribe Noorden, and the mostly recovered\nDemoux. Vin sat at the back, still trying to sort through what she had discovered. Human . . . all koloss .\n. . they had once been people.\n\"There are lots of theories about it, however,\" Elend said. \"Once the Lord Ruler fell, Sazed and I did\nsome research, and discovered some interesting facts from the obligators we interviewed. For instance,\nInquisitors are made from ordinary men—men who remember who they were, but gain new Allomantic\nabilities.\""

Those numbers relating to the percentage of\npeople who fall ill to the mists, they're just too regular to be natural. Nature works in organized\nchaos—randomness on the small scale, with trends on the large scale. I cannot believe that anything\nnatural could have produced such precise results.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Cett asked.\n\"Well, my lord,\" Noorden said. \"Imagine that you hear a tapping sound somewhere outside your tent.\nIf it repeats occasionally, with no exact set pattern, then it might be the wind blowing a loose flap against\na pole. However, if it repeats with exact regularity, you know that it must be a person, beating against a\npole. You'd be able to make the distinction immediately, because you've learned that nature can be\nrepetitive in a case like that, but not exact. These numbers are the same, my lord. They're just too\norganized, too repetitive, to be natural. They had to have been crafted by somebody.\"\n\"You're saying that a person made those soldiers sick?\" Cett asked.\n\"A person? . . . No, not a person, I'd guess,\" Noorden said. \"But something intelligent must have\ndone it. That's the only conclusion I can draw. Something with an agenda, something that cares to be\nprecise.\"\nThe room fell silent.\n\"And, this relates to Inquisitors somehow, my lord?\" Demoux asked carefully.\n\"It does,\" Elend said. \"At least, it does if you think as I do—which, I'll admit, not many people do.\"\n\"For better or for worse . . .\" Ham said, smiling.\n\"Noorden, what do you know of how Inquisitors are made?\" Elend asked.\nThe scribe grew uncomfortable. \"I was in the Canton of Orthodoxy, as you may know, not the Canton\nof Inquisition.\"\n\"Surely there were rumors,\" Elend asked.\n\"Well, of course,\" Noorden said. \"More than rumors, actually. The higher obligators were always\ntrying to discover how the Inquisitors got their power. There was a rivalry between the Cantons, you see,\nand . . . well, I supposed you don't care about that. Regardless, we did have rumors.\"\n\"And?\" Elend asked."

It wasn't just because the Lord Ruler ordered half-breeds to be killed—it\nwas so that the Inquisitors could perpetuate themselves! They needed Allomancers to kill so that they\ncould make new Inquisitors!\"\nElend nodded from his place at the front of the room. \"Somehow, those spikes in the Inquisitors'\nbodies transfer Allomantic ability. You kill eight Mistings, and you give all their powers to one other man,\nsuch as Marsh. Sazed once told me that Marsh was always hesitant to speak of the day he was made an\nInquisitor, but he did say that it was . . . 'messy.' \"\nHam nodded. \"And when Kelsier and Vin found his room the day he was taken and made an\nInquisitor, they found a corpse in there. One they initially assumed was Marsh!\"\n\"Later, Marsh said that more than one person had been killed there,\" Vin said quietly. \"There just\nhadn't been enough . . . left of them to tell.\"\n\"Again,\" Cett said, \"does this all have a point?\"\n\"Well, it seems to be doing a good job of annoying you,\" Ham said lightly. \"Do we need any other\npoint?\"\nElend gave them both hard looks. \"The point is, Cett, that Vin discovered something earlier this week.\"\nThe group turned toward her.\n\"Koloss,\" Vin said. \"They're made from humans.\"\n\"What?\" Cett asked, frowning. \"That's absurd.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, shaking her head. \"I'm sure of it. I've checked living koloss. Hidden in those folds and\nrips of skin on their bodies, they are pierced by spikes. Smaller than the Inquisitor spikes, and made from\ndifferent metals, but all of the koloss have them.\"\n\"Nobody has been able to figure out where new koloss come from,\" Elend said. \"The Lord Ruler\nguarded the secret, and it's become one of the great mysteries of our time. Koloss seem to kill each other\nwith regularity when someone isn't actively controlling them. Yet, there always seem to be more of the\ncreatures.

He made spies, which we call kandra. And he made priests, which\nwe call Inquisitors. He built them all with weaknesses, so that he could control them.\"\n\"I first learned how to take control of the koloss because of TenSoon,\" Vin said. \"He inadvertently\nshowed me the secret. He mentioned that the kandra and koloss were cousins, and I realized I could\ncontrol one just as I had the other.\"\n\"I . . . still don't see where you're heading with this,\" Demoux said, glancing from Vin to Elend.\n\"The Inquisitors must have the same weakness, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"This Hemalurgy leaves the mind\n. . . wounded. It allows an Allomancer to creep in and take control. The nobility always wondered what\nmade the Inquisitors so fanatically devoted to the Lord Ruler. They weren't like regular obligators—they\nwere far more obedient. Zealous to a fault.\"\n\"It happened to Marsh,\" Vin whispered. \"The first time I met him after he'd been made an Inquisitor,\nhe seemed different. But, he only grew even odder during the year following the Collapse. Finally, he\nturned on Sazed, tried to kill him.\"\n\"What we're trying to suggest,\" Elend said, \"is that something is controlling the Inquisitors and the\nkoloss. Something is exploiting the weakness the Lord Ruler built into the creatures and is using them as\nits pawns. The troubles we've been suffering, the chaos following the Collapse—it's not simply chaos.\nNo more than the patterns of people who fall sick to the mists are chaotic.

He wasn't addressing Cett's questions. He was speaking his\nown concerns, following his own logical path.\n\"This war we're fighting,\" Elend continued, \"it isn't just about soldiers.

Cett was carried away to his tent,\nNoorden bustled off to begin this new research, and Ham went in search of something to eat. Demoux,\nhowever, stayed. Vin stood and trailed forward, stepping up to Elend's side and taking his arm as he\nturned to address Demoux.\n\"My lord . . .\" Demoux said, looking a bit embarrassed. \"I assume General Hammond has spoken to\nyou?\"\nWhat's this? Vin thought, perking up.\n\"Yes, Demoux,\" Elend said with a sigh. \"But I really don't think it's something to worry about.\"\n\"What?\" Vin asked.\n\"There is a certain level of . . . ostracism happening in the camp, my lady,\" Demoux said. \"Those of us\nwho fell sick for two weeks, rather than a few days, are being regarded with a measure of suspicion.\"\n\"Suspicion that you no longer agree with, right, Demoux?\" Elend punctuated this remark with a very\nkingly stern look.\nDemoux nodded. \"I trust your interpretation, my lord. It's just that . . . well, it is difficult to lead men\nwho distrust you. And, it's much harder for the others like me. They've taken to eating together, staying"

It's reinforcing the division.\"\n\"What do you think?\" Elend asked. \"Should we try to force reintegration?\"\n\"That depends, my lord,\" Demoux said.\n\"On?\"\n\"On several factors,\" Demoux said. \"If you're planning to attack soon, then reintegrating would be a\nbad idea—I don't want men fighting alongside those they don't trust. However, if we're going to continue\nthe siege for some time, then forcing them back together might make sense. The larger segment of the\narmy would have time to learn to trust the mistfallen again.\"\nMistfallen, Vin thought. Interesting name.\nElend looked down at her, and she knew what he was thinking. The ball at the Canton of Resource\nwas only a few days away. If Elend's plan went well, then perhaps they wouldn't have to attack Fadrex.\nVin didn't have great hopes for that option. Plus, without resupply from Luthadel, they couldn't count\non much anymore. They could continue the siege as planned for months, or they might end up having to\nattack within a few weeks.\n\"Organize a new company,\" Elend said, turning to Demoux. \"Fill it with these mistfallen. We'll worry\nabout dealing with superstition after we hold Fadrex.\"\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"I think that . . .\"\nThey continued talking, but Vin stopped paying attention as she heard voices approaching the\ncommand tent. It was probably nothing. Even so, she moved around so that she was between the\napproaching people and Elend, then checked her metal reserves. Within moments, she could determine\nwho was talking. One was Ham. She relaxed as the tent flap opened, revealing Ham in his standard vest\nand trousers, leading a wearied red-haired soldier. The exhausted man had ash-stained clothing and wore\nthe leathers of a scout.\n\"Conrad?\" Demoux asked with surprise.\n\"You know this man?\" Elend asked.\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Demoux said. \"He's one of the lieutenants I left back in Luthadel with King Penrod.\"\nConrad saluted, though he looked rather the worse for the wear. \"My lord,\" the man said. \"I bring\nnews from the capital.\"\n\"Finally!\" Elend said. \"What word from Penrod? Where are those supply barges I sent for?\"\n\"Supply barges, my lord?\" Conrad asked. \"My lord, King Penrod sent me to ask you for resupply.\nThere are riots in the city, and some of the food stores have been pillaged. King Penrod sent me to ask\nyou for a contingent of troops to help him restore order.\"\n\"Troops?\" Elend asked. \"What of the garrison I left with him? He should have plenty of men!\"\n\"They're not enough, my lord,\" Conrad said. \"I don't know why. I can only relay the message I was\nsent to deliver.\"\nElend cursed, slamming his fist against the command tent's table. \"Can Penrod not do the one thing I\nasked of him? All he needed to do was hold lands we already have secure!\"\nThe soldier jumped at the outburst, and Vin watched with concern. Elend, however, managed to keep"

Elend, however, managed to keep\nhis temper under control. He took a deep breath, waving to the soldier. \"Rest yourself, Lieutenant\nConrad, and get some food. I will want to speak with you further about this later.\"\nVin found Elend later that night, standing on the perimeter of the camp, looking up at the Fadrex watch\nfires on the cliffs above. She laid a hand on his shoulder, and the fact that he didn't jump indicated that\nhe'd heard her coming. It was still a little strange to her that Elend, who had always seemed slightly\noblivious of the world around him, was now a capable Mistborn, with tin to enhance his ears that let him\nhear even the softest footsteps approaching.\n\"You talked to the messenger?\" she asked as he put his arm around her, still looking up at the night\nsky. Ash fell around them. A couple of Elend's soldier Tineyes passed on patrol, carrying no lights,\nsilently walking the perimeter of the camp. Vin herself had just gotten back from a similar patrol, though\nhers had been around the perimeter of Fadrex. She did a couple of rounds every night, watching the city\nfor unusual activity.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said. \"Once he'd had some rest, I spoke to him in depth.\"\n\"Bad news?\"\n\"Much of what he said before. Penrod apparently never got my orders to send food and troops.\nConrad was one of four messengers Penrod sent to us. We don't know what happened to the other\nthree. Conrad himself was chased by a group of koloss, and he only got away by baiting them with his\nhorse, sending it one direction and hiding as they chased it down and butchered it. He slipped away while\nthey were feasting.\"\n\"Brave man,\" Vin said.\n\"Lucky as well,\" Elend said. \"Either way, it seems unlikely that Penrod will be able to send us support.\nThere are food stores in Luthadel, but if the news of riots is true, Penrod won't be able to spare the\nsoldiers it would take to guard supplies on their way to us.\"\n\"So . . . where does that leave us?\" Vin asked.\nElend looked at her, and she was surprised to see determination in his eyes, not frustration. \"With\nknowledge.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Our enemy has exposed himself, Vin. Attacking our messengers directly with hidden pockets of\nkoloss? Trying to undermine our supply base in Luthadel?\" Elend shook his head. \"Our enemy wants this\nto look random, but I see the pattern. It's too focused, too intelligent, to be happenstance. He's trying to\nmake us pull away from Fadrex.\"\nVin felt a chill. Elend made to say more, but she reached up and laid a hand on his lips, quieting him.\nHe seemed confused, but then apparently understood, for he nodded. Whatever we say, Ruin can\nhear, Vin thought. We can't give away what we know.\nStill, something passed between them. A knowledge that they had to stay at Fadrex, that they had to\nfind out what was in that storage cavern. For their enemy was working hard to keep them from doing so."

For their enemy was working hard to keep them from doing so.\nWas Ruin, indeed, behind the chaos in Luthadel? A ploy to draw Elend and his forces back to restore\norder, thereby abandoning Fadrex?\nIt was only speculation, but it was all they had. Vin nodded to Elend, indicating that she agreed with\nhis determination to stay. Still, she worried. Luthadel was to have been their rock in all of this—their\nsecure position. If it was falling apart, what did they have?\nMore and more, she was beginning to understand that there would be no falling back. No retreat to\ndevelop alternative plans. The world was collapsing around them, and Elend had committed himself to\nFadrex.\nIf they failed here, there would be nowhere else to go.\nEventually, Elend squeezed her shoulder, then walked off into the mists to check on some of the guard\nposts. Vin remained alone, staring up at those watch fires, feeling a worrisome sense of foreboding. Her\nthoughts from before, in the fourth storage cavern, returned to her. Fighting wars, besieging cities, playing\nat politics—it wasn't enough. These things wouldn't save them if the very land itself died.\nBut, what else could they do? The only option they had was to take Fadrex and hope the Lord Ruler\nhad left them some clue to help. She still felt an inexplicable desire to find the atium. Why was she so\ncertain it would help?\nShe closed her eyes, not wanting to face the mists, which—as always—pulled away from her, leaving\na half-inch or so of empty air around her. She'd drawn upon them once, back when she'd fought the\nLord Ruler. Why had she been able to fuel her Allomancy with their power that one time?\nShe reached out to them, trying again, as she had so many times. She called to them, pleaded with\nthem in her mind, tried to access their power. And, she felt as if she should be able to. There was a\nstrength to the mists. Trapped within them. But it wouldn't yield to her. It was as if something kept them\nback, some blockage perhaps? Or, maybe, a simple whim on their part.\n\"Why?\" she whispered, eyes still closed. \"Why help me that once, but never again? Am I mad, or did\nyou really give me power when I demanded it?\"\nThe night gave her no answers. Finally, she sighed and turned away, seeking refuge inside of the tent.\nHemalurgic spikes change people physically, depending on which powers are granted, where the\nspike is placed, and how many spikes someone has. Inquisitors, for instance, are changed\ndrastically from the humans they used to be. Their hearts are in different places from those of\nhumans, and their brains rearrange to accommodate the lengths of metal jabbed through their\neyes.

Ironically, while the spikes dehumanize the koloss, they\ngive a measure of humanity to the kandra.\n41\n\"DON'T YOU SEE, BREEZE?\" Sazed said eagerly. \"This is an example of what we call ostention—a\nlegend being emulated in real life. The people believed in the Survivor of Hathsin, and so they have made\nfor themselves another survivor to help them in their time of need.\"\nBreeze raised an eyebrow. They stood near the back of a crowd gathering in the market district,\nwaiting for the Citizen arrive.\n\"It is fascinating,\" Sazed said. \"This is an evolution of the Survivor legend that I never anticipated. I\nknew that they might deify him—in fact, that was almost inevitable. However, since Kelsier was once an\n'ordinary' person, those who worship him can imagine other people achieving the same status.\"\nBreeze nodded distractedly. Allrianne stood beside him, looking quite petulant that she'd been\nrequired to wear drab skaa clothing.\nSazed ignored their lack of excitement. \"I wonder what the future of this will be. Perhaps there will be\na succession of Survivors for this people. This could be the foundation of a religion with true lasting\npotential, since it could reinvent itself to suit the needs of the populace. Of course, new Survivors mean\nnew leaders—each one with different opinions. Rather than a line of priests who promote orthodoxy,\neach new Survivor would seek to establish himself as distinct from those he succeeded. It could make for\nnumerous factions and divisions in the body of worshippers.\"\n\"Sazed,\" Breeze said. \"What ever happened to not collecting religions?\"\nSazed paused. \"I'm not really collecting this religion. I'm just theorizing about its potential.\"\nBreeze raised an eyebrow.\n\"Besides,\" Sazed said. \"It might have to do with our current mission. If this new Survivor is indeed a\nreal person, he may be able to help us overthrow Quellion.\"\n\"Or,\" Allrianne noted, \"he might present a challenge to us for leadership of the city once Quellion does\nfall.\"\n\"True,\" Sazed admitted. \"Either way, I do not see why you are complaining, Breeze. Did you not want\nme to become interested in religions again?\"\n\"That was before I realized you'd spend the entire evening, then the next morning, chattering about it,\"\nBreeze said. \"Where is Quellion, anyway? If I miss lunch because of his executions, I'll be rather\nannoyed.\"\nExecutions. In his excitement, Sazed had nearly forgotten just what it was they had come to see. His\neagerness deflated, and he remembered why Breeze was acting so solemnly.

Something was making a stir: the\nCitizen, wearing a bright blue costume. It was a new \"approved\" color—one only he was allowed to\nwear. His councillors surrounded him in red.\n\"Finally,\" Breeze said, following the crowd as they bunched up around the Citizen.\nSazed followed, his steps growing reluctant. Now that he thought about it, he was tempted to use his\ntroops to try to stop what was about to occur. Of course, he knew that would be foolish. Playing his\nhand now to save a few would ruin their chances of saving the entire city. With a sigh, he followed\nBreeze and Allrianne, moving with the crowd. He also suspected that watching the murders would\nremind him of the pressing nature of his duties in Urteau. Theological studies would wait for another time.\n\"You're going to have to kill them,\" Kelsier said.\nSpook crouched quietly atop a building in the wealthier section of Urteau. Below, the Citizen's\nprocession was approaching; Spook watched it through cloth-wrapped eyes. It had taken many\ncoins—nearly the last of what he'd brought with him from Luthadel—to bribe out the location of the\nexecutions sufficiently in advance so that he could get into position.\nHe could see the sorry individuals that Quellion had decided to murder. Many of them were like\nFranson's sister—people who had been discovered to have noble parentage. Several others, however,\nwere only spouses of those with noble blood. Spook also knew of one man in this group who had\nspoken out too loudly against Quellion. The man's connection to the nobility was tenuous. He had once\nbeen a craftsman catering specifically to a noble clientele.\n\"I know you don't want to do it,\" Kelsier said. \"But you can't lose your nerve now.\"\nSpook felt powerful—pewter lent him an air of invincibility that he'd never before imagined. He had\nslept barely a few hours in the last six days, but he didn't feel tired. He had a sense of balance that any\ncat would have envied, and he had strength his muscles shouldn't have been able to produce.\nAnd yet, power wasn't everything. His palms were sweating beneath his cloak, and he felt beads of\nperspiration creeping down his brow. He was no Mistborn. He wasn't Kelsier or Vin. He was just\nSpook. What was he thinking?\n\"I can't do it,\" he whispered.\n\"You can,\" Kelsier said. \"You've practiced with the cane—I've watched. Plus, you stood against those\nsoldiers in the market. They nearly killed you, but you were fighting two Thugs. You did very well,\nconsidering.\"\n\"I . . .\"\n\"You need to save those people, Spook. Ask yourself: What would I do if I were there?\"\n\"I'm not you.\"\n\"Not yet,\" Kelsier whispered.\nNot yet.\nBelow, Quellion preached against the people about to be executed.

Or, was that just what Spook\nwanted to see in her? He followed her gaze, watching the prisoners. One of them was a child, holding\nfearfully to a woman as the group was prodded into the building that would become their pyre.\nKelsier's right, Spook thought. I can't let this happen. I may not succeed, but at least I have to\ntry. His hands continued to shake as he moved through the hatch atop his building and dashed down the\nsteps, cloak whipping behind him. He rounded a corner, heading for the wine cellar.\nNoblemen were strange creatures. During the days of the Lord Ruler, they had often feared for their\nlives as much as skaa thieves did, for court intrigue often led to imprisonment or assassination. Spook\nshould have realized what he was missing from the beginning. No thieving crew would build a lair without\na bolt-hole for emergency escapes.\nWhy would the nobility be any different?\nHe leaped, cloak flapping as he dropped the last few steps. He hit the dusty floor, and his enhanced\nears heard Quellion begin to rant up above. The skaa crowds were murmuring. The flames had started.\nThere, in the darkened basement of the building, Spook found a section of the wall already open, a\nsecret passageway leading from the building next door. A group of soldiers stood in the passageway.\n\"Quickly,\" Spook heard one of them say, \"before the fire gets here.\"\n\"Please!\" another voice cried, her words echoing through the passageway. \"At least take the child!\"\nPeople grunted. The soldiers moved on the opposite side of the passage from Spook, keeping the\npeople in the other basement from escaping. They had been sent by Quellion to save one of the\nprisoners. On the outside, the Citizen made a show of denouncing anyone with noble blood.\nAllomancers, however, were too valuable to kill. And so, he chose his buildings carefully—only burning\nthose with hidden exits through which he could carefully extract the Allomancers.\nIt was the perfect way to show orthodoxy, yet maintain a grip on the city's most powerful resource.\nBut it wasn't this hypocrisy that made Spook's hands stop shaking as he charged the soldiers.\nIt was the crying child.\n\"Kill them!\" Kelsier screamed.\nSpook whipped out his dueling cane. One of the soldiers finally noticed him, spinning in shock.\nHe fell first.\nSpook hadn't realized how hard he could swing. The soldier's helmet flew through the hidden\npassageway, its metal crumpled. The other soldiers cried out as Spook leaped over their fallen\ncompanion in the close confines. They carried swords, but had trouble drawing them.\nSpook, however, had brought daggers.\nHe pulled one free, wielding it with a swing powered by both pewter and fury, enhanced senses\nguiding his steps. He cut through two soldiers, elbowing their dying bodies aside, pressing his advantage.\nAt the end of the passageway, four soldiers stood with a short skaa man.\nFear shone in their eyes."

They pushed\nbackward, throwing open the secret door and stumbling over themselves as they entered the building\nbasement on the other side.\nThe structure was already well on its way to burning down. Spook could smell the smoke. The rest of\nthe condemned people were in the room—they had probably been trying to get through the doorway to\nfollow their friend who had escaped. Now they were forced backward as the soldiers shoved their way\ninto the room, finally drawing their swords.\nSpook gutted the slowest of the four soldiers, then left his dagger in the body, pulling out a second\ndueling cane. The firm length of wood felt good in his hand as he spun between shocked civilians,\nattacking the soldiers.\n\"The soldiers can't be allowed to escape,\" Kelsier whispered. \"Otherwise, Quellion will know that the\npeople were rescued. You have to leave him confused.\"\nLight flickered in a hallway beyond the well-furnished basement room. Firelight. Spook could feel the\nheat already. Grimly, the three backlit soldiers raised their swords. Smoke began to creep in along the\nceiling, spreading like a dark black mist. Prisoners cringed, confused.\nSpook dashed forward, spinning as he swung both of his canes at one of the soldiers. The man took\nthe bait, sidestepping Spook's attack, then lunging forward. In an ordinary fight, Spook would have been\nskewered.\nPewter and tin saved him. Spook moved on feet made light, feeling the wind of the oncoming sword,\nknowing where it would pass. His heart thudded inside his chest as the sword sliced through the fabric at\nhis side, but missed the flesh. He brought a cane down, cracking the man's sword arm, then smacked\nanother into his skull.\nThe soldier fell, surprise visible in his dying eyes as Spook pushed past him.\nThe next soldier was already swinging. Spook brought up both of his canes, crossing them to block.\nThe sword bit through one, spinning half of the cane into the air, but got caught in the second. Spook\nsnapped his weapon to the side, pushing the blade away, then spun inside the man's reach and took him\ndown with an elbow to the stomach.\nSpook punched the man's head as he fell. The sound of bone on bone cracked in the burning room.\nThe soldier slumped at Spook's feet.\nI can actually do this! Spook thought. I am like them. Vin and Kelsier. No more hiding in\nbasements or fleeing from danger. I can fight!\nHe spun, smiling.\nAnd found the final soldier standing with Spook's own knife held to the neck of a young girl. The\nsoldier stood with his back to the burning hallway, eyeing escape through the hidden passage. Behind the\nman, flames were curling around the wooden doorframe, licking the room.\n\"The rest of you, get out!\" Spook said, not turning from the soldier. \"Go out the back door of the\nbuilding you find at the end of this tunnel.

He must have known he was facing an Allomancer—no ordinary\nman could have taken down so many soldiers so quickly. Fortunately, it appeared that Quellion hadn't\nsent his own Allomancers into the building. He likely kept them above, protecting him.\nSpook stood still. He dropped the broken dueling cane, but held the other tightly to keep his hand\nfrom shaking. The girl whimpered quietly.\nWhat would Kelsier have done?\nBehind him, the last of the prisoners was fleeing into the passage. \"You!\" Spook said without turning.\n\"Bar that door from the outside. Quickly!\"\n\"But—\"\n\"Do it!\" Spook yelled.\n\"No!\" the soldier said, pressing the knife against the girl's neck. \"I'll kill her!\"\n\"Do and you die,\" Spook said. \"You know that. Look at me. You're not getting past me. You're—\"\nThe door thunked closed.\nThe soldier cried out, dropping the girl, rushing toward the door, obviously trying to get to it before the\nbar fell on the other side. \"That's the only way out! You'll get us—\"\nSpook broke the man's knees with a single crack of the dueling cane. The soldier screamed, falling to\nthe ground. Flames burned on three of the walls, now. The heat was already intense.\nThe bar clicked into place on the other side of the door. Spook looked down at the soldier. Still alive.\n\"Leave him,\" Kelsier said. \"Let him burn in the building.\"\nSpook hesitated.\n\"He would have let all of those people die,\" Kelsier said. \"Let him feel what he would have done to\nthese—what he has already done several times, at Quellion's command.\"\nSpook left the groaning man on the ground, moving over to the secret door. He threw his weight\nagainst it.\nIt held.\nSpook cursed quietly, raising a boot and kicking the door. It, however, remained solid.\n\"That door was built by noblemen who feared they would be pursued by assassins,\" Kelsier said.\n\"They were familiar with Allomancy, and would make certain the door was strong enough to resist a\nThug's kick.\"\nThe fire was growing hotter. The girl huddled on the floor, whimpering. Spook whirled, staring down\nthe flames, feeling their heat. He stepped forward, but his amplified senses were so keen that the heat\nseemed amazingly powerful to him.\nHe gritted his teeth, picking up the girl.\nI have pewter now, he thought. It can balance the power of my senses.\nThat will have to be enough.\nSmoke billowed out the windows of the condemned building. Sazed waited with Breeze and Allrianne,\nstanding at the back of a solemn crowd. The people were oddly silent as they watched the flames claim\ntheir prize.

I could make this crowd rip him apart.\"\n\"And his second-in-command would take control,\" Breeze said, \"then execute these people.

He frowned, watching the building. One of the building's boarded\nwindows—one high in a peaked attic section on top of the roof itself—seemed to be shaking.\n\"Look!\" Sazed said. \"There!\"\nBreeze raised an eyebrow. \"Perhaps our Flame God is about to make his appearance, eh?\" He smiled\nat what he obviously found a ridiculous concept. \"I wonder what we were supposed to learn during this\nrevolting little experience.

Then\nthe window burst outward.\nA figure in dark clothing leaped through the shattering mess of boards and smoke, landing on the\nrooftop. His long cloak actually appeared to be on fire in places, and he carried a small bundle in his\narms. A child. The figure rushed along the top of the burning rooftop, then leaped off the front of the\nbuilding, trailing smoke as he fell to the ground.\nHe landed with the grace of a man burning pewter, not stumbling despite the two-story fall, his burning\ncloak billowing out around him.

Breeze Soothed away his distracting emotions—his\nconfusion, his concern—and left Sazed, along with the crowd, completely open to Allrianne's focused\nburst of enraged anger.\nThe crowd exploded with motion, people crying out in the name of the Survivor, rushing the guards.\nFor a moment, Sazed feared that Spook wouldn't take the opportunity to run. Despite the strange\nbandage on Spook's eyes, Sazed could tell that the boy was staring straight at Quellion—as if in\nchallenge.\nFortunately, however, Spook finally turned away. The crowd distracted the advancing soldiers, and\nSpook ran on feet that seemed to move far too quickly. He ducked down an alleyway, carrying the girl\nhe had rescued, his cloak trailing smoke. As soon as Spook had a safe head start, Breeze smothered the\ncrowd's will to rebel, keeping them from getting themselves cut down by the soldiers. The people backed\naway, dispersing. The Citizen's soldiers, however, stayed close around their leader. Sazed could hear\nfrustration in the Citizen's voice as he called for the inevitable retreat. He couldn't spare more than a few\nmen to chase down Spook, not with the potential of a riot. He had to get himself to safety.\nAs soldiers marched away, Breeze turned an eye toward Sazed. \"Well,\" he noted, \"that was\nsomewhat unexpected.\"\nI think that the koloss were more intelligent than we wanted to give them credit for being. For\ninstance, originally, they used only spikes the Lord Ruler gave them to make new members. He\nwould provide the metal and the unfortunate skaa captives, and the koloss would create new\n\"recruits.\"\nAt the Lord Ruler's death, then, the koloss should quickly have died out. This was how he had\ndesigned them. If they got free from his control, he expected them to kill themselves off and end\ntheir own rampage. However, they somehow made the deduction that spikes in the bodies of\nfallen koloss could be harvested, then reused.\nThey then no longer required a fresh supply of spikes. I often wonder what effect the constant\nreuse of spikes had on their population. A spike can only hold so much of a Hemalurgic charge, so\nthey could not create spikes that granted infinite strength, no matter how many people those\nspikes killed and drew power from. However, did the repeated reuse of spikes perhaps bring more\nhumanity to the koloss they made?\n42\nWHEN MARSH ENTERED LUTHADEL, he was far more careful than he had been when he'd\nentered the nameless town at the western border of the dominance. An Inquisitor moving through the\ncapital of Elend's empire would not go unreported, and might draw undue attention. The emperor was\ngone, and he had left his playground open to be used by others. No need to spoil that.\nSo, Marsh moved at night, hooded cloak up, burning steel and jumping about on coins. Even so,"

Even so,\nseeing the magnificent city—sprawling, dirty, yet still home—was hard for the watching, waiting part of\nMarsh. Once, Marsh himself had run the skaa rebellion in this city. He felt responsible for its occupants,\nand the thought of Ruin doing to them what he'd done to the people of the other town, the one where the\nashmount had blown . . .\nThere was no ashmount that close to Luthadel. Unfortunately, there were things Ruin could do to a city\nthat didn't involve natural forces. On his way to Luthadel, Marsh had stopped at no fewer than four\nvillages, where he had secretly killed the men guarding their food stores, then set fire to the buildings that\ncontained them. He knew that the other Inquisitors went about the world, committing similar atrocities as\nthey searched for the thing Ruin desired above all others. The thing Preservation had taken from him.\nHe had yet to find it.\nMarsh leaped over a street, landing atop a peaked rooftop, running along its edge and making his way\ntoward the northeastern side of the city. Luthadel had changed during the year since he'd last seen it. The\nLord Ruler's forced labor projects had brutalized the skaa, but had kept things clean of ash and given\neven the oversized city a sense of order. There was none of that now. Growing food was obviously a\npriority—and keeping the city clean could wait for later, if there was a later.\nThere were far more trash heaps now, and mounds of ash—which would have once been scraped into\nthe river at the center of the city—slumped in alleys and against buildings. Marsh felt himself begin to\nsmile at the beauty of the disrepair, and his little, rebellious part withdrew and hid.\nHe couldn't fight. Now was not the time.\nHe soon arrived at Keep Venture, seat of Elend's government. It had been invaded by koloss during\nthe siege of Luthadel, its lower stained-glass windows shattered by the beasts. The windows had been\nreplaced only by boards. Marsh smiled, then Steelpush-leaped up to a balcony on the second floor. He\nwas familiar with this building. Before he'd been taken by Ruin, he had spent several months living here,\nhelping Emperor Venture keep control in his city.\nMarsh found Penrod's rooms easily. They were the only ones occupied, and the only ones guarded.\nMarsh crouched a few corridors down, watching with his inhuman eyes as he considered his next course\nof action.\nImpaling an unwilling subject with a Hemalurgic spike was a very tricky prospect. The spike's size\nwas, in this case, immaterial. Just as a pinch of metal dust could fuel Allomancy for a time, or a small ring\ncould hold a small Feruchemical charge, a rather small bit of metal could work for Hemalurgy. Inquisitor\nspikes were made large to be intimidating, but a small pin could, in many instances, be just as effective as\na massive spike. It depended on how long one wanted to leave the spike outside of a person's body after\nusing it to kill someone."

It depended on how long one wanted to leave the spike outside of a person's body after\nusing it to kill someone.\nFor Marsh's purposes this day, a small spike was preferable; he didn't want to give Penrod powers,\njust pierce him with metal. Marsh pulled out the spike he had made from the Allomancer in the doomed\ntown a few days back. It was about five inches long—actually bigger than it needed to be, strictly\nspeaking. However, Marsh would need to drive this spike forcefully into a man's body, which meant it\nneeded to be at least large enough to hold its shape. There were some two or three hundred bind points\nacross a human's body. Marsh didn't know them all; Ruin would guide his hand when the time came to\nstrike, making sure the spike was delivered to the right place. His master's direct attention was focused\nelsewhere at the moment, and he was giving Marsh general commands to get into position and prepare\nfor the attack.\nHemalurgic spikes. The hidden part of himself shivered, remembering the day when he had\nunexpectedly been made into an Inquisitor. He'd thought that he had been discovered. He'd been\nworking as a spy for Kelsier in the Steel Priesthood. Little did he know that he hadn't been singled out as\nsuspicious—he'd been singled out as extraordinary.\nThe Inquisitors had come for him at night, while he'd waited nervously to meet with Kelsier and pass\non what he assumed would be his final message to the rebellion. They'd burst through the door, moving\nmore quickly than Marsh could react. They gave him no option. They'd simply slammed him down\nagainst the ground, then thrown a screaming woman on top of him.\nThen, the Inquisitors had pounded a spike right through her heart and into Marsh's eye.\nThe pain was too great for him to remember. That moment was a hole in his memory, filled with vague\nimages of the Inquisitors repeating this process, killing other unfortunate Allomancers and pounding their\npowers—their very souls, it seemed—into Marsh's body. When it was finished, he lay groaning on the\nfloor, a new flood of sensory information making it difficult for him even to think. Around him, the other\nInquisitors had danced about, cutting apart the other bodies with their axes, rejoicing in the addition of\nanother member to their ranks.\nThat was, in a way, the day of his birth. What a wonderful day. Penrod, however, would not have\nsuch joy. He wasn't to be made into an Inquisitor—he would get only a single, small spike. One that had\nbeen made days ago, and been allowed to sit outside a body—leaking power—all that time.\nMarsh waited for Ruin to come to him in force. Not only would the spike have to be planted precisely,\nbut Penrod would have to leave it in long enough for Ruin to begin influencing his thoughts and emotions.\nThe spike had to touch the blood—at first, at least. After the spike was pounded in, the skin could heal\naround the metal, and the spike would still work. However, to begin with, there would be blood.\nHow did one make a person forget about five inches of metal sprouting from their body? How did one\nmake others ignore it?

Ruin had tried to get a spike into Elend Venture on several occasions now, and\nhad always failed. In fact, most attempts failed. The few people claimed with the process, however, were\nworth the effort.\nRuin came upon him, and he lost control of his body. He moved without knowing what he was going\nto do, following direct orders. Down the corridor. Don't attack the guards. In through the door.\nMarsh shoved aside the two watching soldiers, kicking the door down and bursting into the\nantechamber.\nRight. To the bedchamber.\nMarsh was through the room in a heartbeat, the two soldiers belatedly screaming for help outside.\nPenrod was an aging man with a dignified air. He had the presence of mind to leap from his bed at the\nsounds, grabbing a hardwood dueling cane from its place atop his nightstand.\nMarsh smiled. A dueling cane? Against an Inquisitor? He pulled his obsidian hand axe from the sheath\nat his side.\nFight him, Ruin said, but do not kill him. Make it a difficult battle, but allow him to feel that he's\nholding you off.\nIt was an odd request, but Marsh's mind was so directly controlled that he couldn't even pause to\nthink about it. He could simply leap forward to attack.\nIt was harder than it seemed. He had to make sure to strike with the axe in ways that Penrod could\nblock. Several times, he had to tap speed from one of his spikes—which doubled as a Feruchemical\nmetalmind—to suddenly inch his axe in the right direction, lest he accidentally behead the king of\nLuthadel.\nYet, Marsh did it. He cut Penrod a few times, fighting all the while with the small spike held hidden in\nhis left palm, letting the king think he was doing well. Within moments, the guards had joined the fight,\nwhich allowed Marsh to keep up appearances even better. Three normal men against an Inquisitor was\nstill no contest, but from their perspectives, maybe it would seem like one.\nIt wasn't long before a troop of some dozen guards burst into the chamber outside the bedroom,\ncoming to aid their king.\nNow, Ruin said. Act frightened, get ready to put the spike in, and prepare to flee out the\nwindow.\nMarsh tapped speed and moved. Ruin guided his hand precisely as he slammed his left hand into\nPenrod's chest, driving the spike directly into the man's heart. Marsh heard Penrod scream, smiled at the\nsound, and leaped out the window.\nA short time later, Marsh hung outside that same window, unseen and unnoticed, even by the numerous\nguard patrols. He was far too skilled, far too careful, to be spotted listening with tin-enhanced ears,\nhanging underneath an outcropping of stone near the window. Inside, surgeons conferred.\n\"When we try to pull the spike out, the bleeding increases dramatically, my lord,\" one voice explained.\n\"The shard of metal got dangerously close to your heart,\" said another.\nDangerously close? Marsh thought with a smile from his upside-down perch. The spike pierced his\nheart. But, of course, the surgeons couldn't know that. Since Penrod was conscious, they would assume\nthat the spike had come close, but somehow just barely missed."

Since Penrod was conscious, they would assume\nthat the spike had come close, but somehow just barely missed.\n\"We fear pulling it out,\" the first surgeon said. \"How . . . do you feel?\"\n\"Remarkably good, actually,\" said Penrod. \"There is an ache, and some discomfort. But I feel strong.\"\n\"Then let us leave the shard, for now,\" the first surgeon said, sounding concerned. But, what else could\nhe do? If he did pull the spike out, it would kill Penrod. A clever move by Ruin.\nThey would wait for Penrod to regain his strength, then try again to remove the spike. Again, it would\nthreaten Penrod's life. They'd have to leave it. And, with Ruin now able to touch his mind—not control\nhim, just nudge things in certain directions—Penrod would soon forget about the spike. The discomfort\nwould fade, and with the spike under his clothing, no one would find it irregular.\nAnd then he would be Ruin's as surely as any Inquisitor. Marsh smiled, let go of the outcropping, and\ndropped to the dark streets below.\nFor all that it disgusts me, I cannot help but be impressed by Hemalurgy as an art. In Allomancy\nand Feruchemy, skill and subtlety come through the application of one's powers. The best\nAllomancer might not be the most powerful, but instead the one who can best manipulate the\nPushes and Pulls of metals. The best Feruchemist is the one who is most capable of sorting the\ninformation in his copperminds, or best able to manipulate his weight with iron.\nThe art that is unique to Hemalurgy, however, is the knowledge of where to place the spikes.\n43\nVIN LANDED WITH A HUSHED rustle of cloth. She crouched in the night, holding up her dress to\nkeep it from brushing the ashen rooftop, then peered into the mists.\nElend dropped beside her, then fell into a crouch, asking no questions. She smiled, noting that his\ninstincts were getting better. He watched the mists too, though he obviously didn't know what he was\nlooking for.\n\"He's following us,\" Vin whispered.\n\"Yomen's Mistborn?\" Elend asked.\nVin nodded.\n\"Where?\" he asked.\n\"Three houses back,\" Vin said.\nElend squinted, and she felt one of his Allomantic pulses suddenly increase in speed. He was flaring tin.\n\"That lump on the right side?\" Elend asked.\n\"Close enough,\" Vin said.\n\"So . . .\"\n\"So, he knows I've spotted him,\" Vin said. \"Otherwise, I wouldn't have stopped. Right now, we're\nstudying one another.\"\nElend reached to his belt, slipping out an obsidian knife.\n\"He won't attack,\" Vin said.\n\"How do you know?\"\n\"Because,\" Vin said. \"When he intends to kill us, he'll try to do it when you and I aren't together—or\nwhen we're sleeping.\"\nThat seemed to make Elend even more nervous. \"Is that why you've been staying up all night lately?\"\nVin nodded.

Forcing Elend to sleep alone was a small price to pay for keeping him safe. Is it you\nback there following us, Yomen? she wondered. On the night of your own party? That would be\nquite the feat. It didn't seem likely; but still, Vin was suspicious. She had a habit of suspecting everyone\nof being Mistborn. She still thought it was healthy, even if she had been wrong more often than not.\n\"Come on,\" she said, rising. \"Once we get into the party, we shouldn't have to worry about him.\"\nElend nodded, and the two continued along their path to the Canton of Resource.\nThe plan is simple, Elend had said just hours before. I'll confront Yomen, and the nobility won't be\nable to help gathering around to gawk. At that point, you sneak away and see if you can find your\nway to the storage chamber.\nIt really was a simple plan—the best ones usually were. If Elend confronted Yomen, it would keep the\nattention of the guards on him, hopefully letting Vin slip out. She'd have to move quickly and quietly, and\nwould probably have to eliminate some guards—all without raising an alarm. Yet, this appeared to be the\nonly way in. Not only was Yomen's fortress-like building well lit and extremely well guarded, but his\nMistborn was good. The man had detected her every other time she'd tried to sneak in—always\nremaining at a distance, his mere presence warning her that he could raise the alarm in a heartbeat.\nTheir best chance was the ball. Yomen's defenses, and his Mistborn, would be focused on their\nmaster, keeping him safe.\nThey landed in the courtyard, causing carriages to stop and guards to turn in shock. Vin glanced to\nElend in the misty darkness. \"Elend,\" she said quietly, \"I need you to promise me something.\"\nHe frowned. \"What?\"\n\"Eventually, I'm going to get spotted,\" Vin said. \"I'll sneak as best I can, but I doubt we'll get through\nthis without creating a disturbance. When it hits, I want you to get out.\"\n\"Vin, I can't do that. I have to—\"\n\"No,\" Vin said sharply. \"Elend, you don't have to help me. You can't help me. I love you, but you're\njust not as good at this as I am. I can take care of myself, but I need to know that I won't have to take\ncare of you, too. If anything goes wrong—or, if things go right, but the building goes on alert—I want you\nto get out. I'll meet you at the camp.\"\n\"And if you get into trouble?\" Elend said.\nVin smiled. \"Trust me.\"\nHe paused, then nodded. Trusting her was one thing he could obviously do—something he'd always\ndone.\nThe two strode forward. It felt very strange to be attending a ball at a Ministry building. Vin was\naccustomed to stained glass and ornamentation, but Canton offices were generally austere—and this one\nwas no exception. It was only a single story tall, and it had sharp, flat walls with very small windows. No\nlimelights illuminated the outside, and while a couple of large tapestry banners fluttered against the"

No\nlimelights illuminated the outside, and while a couple of large tapestry banners fluttered against the\nstonework, the only indication that this night was special was the cluster of carriages and nobility in the\ncourtyard. The soldiers in the area had noted Vin and Elend, but made no move to engage—or even\nslow—them.\nThose watching—both nobility and soldiers—were interested, but few of them looked surprised. Vin\nand Elend were expected. Vin's hunch about that was confirmed when she moved up the steps, and\nnobody moved to intercept them. The guards at the door watched suspiciously, but let her and Elend\npass.\nInside, she found a long entry hall, lit by lamps. The flow of people turned left, so Vin and Elend\nfollowed, twisting through a few labyrinthine corridors until they approached a larger meeting hall.\n\"Not exactly the most impressive place for a ball, eh?\" Elend said as they waited their turn to be\nannounced.\nVin nodded. Most noble keeps had exterior entrances directly into their ballroom. The room\nahead—from what she could see of it—had been adapted from a standard Ministry meeting room.\nRivets covered the floor where benches had once been, and there was a stage on the far side of the\nroom, where obligators had probably once stood to give instruction to their subordinates. This was\nwhere Yomen's table had been set up.\nIt was too small to be a truly practical ballroom. The people inside weren't cramped, exactly, but\nneither did they have the space the nobility preferred for forming separate little groups where they could\ngossip.\n\"Looks like there are other party rooms,\" Elend said, nodding to several corridors leading from the\nmain \"ballroom.\" People were trailing in and out of them.\n\"Places for people to go if they feel too crowded,\" Vin said. \"This is going to be a tough place to\nescape, Elend. Don't let yourself get cornered. Looks like an exit over there to the left.\"\nElend followed her gaze as they walked into the main room. Flickering torchlight and trails of mist\nindicated a courtyard or atrium. \"I'll stay close to it,\" he said. \"And avoid going to any of the smaller side\nrooms.\"\n\"Good,\" Vin said. She also noted something else—twice during the trip through the corridors to the\nballroom, she'd seen stairwells leading down. That implied a fairly large basement, something uncommon\nback in Luthadel. The Canton building goes down, rather than up, she decided. It made sense,\nassuming that there really was a storage cache below.\nThe door herald announced them without needing a card to read from, and the two entered the room.\nThe party was nowhere near as lavish as the one at Keep Orielle had been. There were snacks, but no\ndinner—likely because there wasn't room for dining tables. There was music and dancing, but the room\nwas not draped in finery. Yomen had elected to leave the simple, stark Ministry walls uncovered.\n\"I wonder why he even bothers to hold balls,\" Vin whispered.\n\"He probably had to start them,\" Elend said. \"To prompt the other nobility.

It's smart of him, though. It gives a man some measure of power to be able to draw the nobility\ninto his home and be their host.\"\nVin nodded, then eyed the dance floor. \"One dance before we split up?\"\nElend wavered. \"To tell you the truth, I feel a bit too nervous.\"\nVin smiled, then kissed him lightly, completely breaking noble protocol. \"Give me about an hour before\nthe distraction. I want to get a feel for the party before I sneak away.\"\nHe nodded, and they split, Elend heading directly for a group of men that Vin didn't recognize. Vin\nherself kept moving. She didn't want to get bogged down by conversation, so she avoided the women\nshe recognized from Keep Orielle. She knew that she should probably have worked to reinforce her\ncontacts, but the truth was that she felt a little bit of what Elend did. Not truly nervousness, but rather a\ndesire to avoid typical ball activities. She wasn't here to mingle. She had more important tasks to be\nconcerned with.\nSo, she meandered through the ballroom, sipping a cup of wine and studying the guards. There were a\nlot of them, which was probably good. The more guards there were in the ballroom, the fewer there\nwould be in the rest of the building. Theoretically.\nVin kept moving, nodding to people, but withdrawing anytime one of them tried to make conversation\nwith her. If she had been Yomen, she would have ordered a few particular soldiers to keep watch on\nher, just to make certain that she didn't stray anywhere sensitive. Yet, none of the men seemed to be all\nthat focused on her. As the hour passed, she grew more and more frustrated. Was Yomen really so\nincompetent that he wouldn't keep watch on a known Mistborn who entered his home base?\nAnnoyed, Vin burned bronze. Perhaps there were Allomancers nearby. She nearly jumped in shock\nwhen she felt the Allomantic pulsings coming from just beside her.\nThere were two of them. Courtly puffs—women whose names she didn't know, but who looked\ndistinctly dismissible. That was probably the idea. They stood chatting with a couple of other women a\nshort distance from Vin. One was burning copper, the other was burning tin—Vin would never have\npicked them out if she hadn't had the ability to pierce copperclouds.\nAs Vin drifted through the room, the two followed, moving with an impressive level of skill as they slid\nin and out of conversations. They always stuck close enough to Vin to be within tin-enhanced hearing\nrange, yet stayed far enough away in the relatively crowded room that Vin would never have picked them\nout without Allomantic help.\nInteresting, she thought, moving toward the perimeter of the room. At least Yomen wasn't\nunderestimating her. But now, how to give the women the slip? They wouldn't be distracted by Elend's\ndisturbance, and they certainly wouldn't let Vin sneak away without raising an alarm.\nAs she wandered, working on the problem, she noted a familiar figure sitting at the edge of the"

Slowswift sat in his usual suit, smoking his pipe as he relaxed in one of the chairs set out for the\nelderly or the overdanced. She trailed over toward him.\n\"I thought you didn't come to these things,\" she noted, smiling. Behind, her two shadows expertly\nworked their way into a conversation a short distance away.\n\"I only come when my king holds them,\" Slowswift said.\n\"Ah,\" Vin said, then she drifted away. Out of the corner of her eye, she noted Slowswift frowning.\nHe'd obviously expected her to speak to him further, but she couldn't risk his saying anything\nincriminating. At least, not yet. Her tails extricated themselves from their conversation, the speed of Vin's\ndeparture forcing them to do so awkwardly. After walking for a bit, Vin paused, giving the women the\nchance to get themselves into yet another conversation.\nThen, Vin spun and walked quickly back to Slowswift, trying to look as if she'd just remembered\nsomething. Her tails, intent on looking natural, had trouble following. They hesitated, and Vin gained just\na few short breaths of freedom.\nShe leaned down to Slowswift as she passed. \"I need two men,\" she said. \"Ones you trust against\nYomen. Have them meet me in a part of the party that is more secluded, a place where people can sit\nand chat.\"\n\"The patio,\" Slowswift said. \"Down the left corridor, then outside.\"\n\"Good,\" Vin said. \"Tell your men to go there, but then wait until I approach them. Also, please send a\nmessenger to Elend. Tell him I need another half hour.\"\nSlowswift nodded to the cryptic comment, and Vin smiled as her shadows trailed closer. \"I hope you\nfeel better soon,\" she said, putting on a fond smile.\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" Slowswift said, coughing slightly.\nVin trailed away again. She slowly made her way in the direction Slowswift had indicated, the exit\nshe'd picked out earlier. Sure enough, a few moments later she passed into mist. The mist vanishes\ninside buildings, eventually, Vin thought. Everyone always assumes it has something to do with\nheat, or perhaps the lack of airflow. . . .\nIn a few seconds, she found herself standing on a lantern-lit garden patio. Though tables had been set\nup for people to relax, the patio was sparsely populated. Servants wouldn't go out in the mists, and most\nnobility—though they didn't like to admit it—found the mists disconcerting. Vin wandered over to an\nornate metal railing, then leaned against it, looking up at the sky, feeling the mists around her and idly\nfingering her earring.\nSoon, her two shadows appeared, chatting quietly, and Vin's tin let her hear that they were talking\nabout how stuffy the other room had been. Vin smiled, maintaining her posture as the two women took\nchairs a distance away, continuing to chat. After that, two young men wandered in and sat down at\nanother table. They weren't as natural about the process as the women, but Vin hoped they weren't\nsuspicious enough to draw attention.\nThen, she waited."

She didn't think of him very often, anymore—or, really,\nanyone from her old life. That life had been one of pain and sorrow. A brother who beat her to keep her\nsafe, a crazy mother who had inexplicably slaughtered Vin's baby sister.\nHowever, that life was only a faint echo, now. She smiled to herself, amused at how far she had come.\nReen might have called her a fool, but she trusted Elend—trusted him to succeed, trusted him with her\nlife. That was something she could never have done during her early years.\nAfter about ten minutes, someone came out from the party and wandered over to the pair of women.\nHe spoke with them just briefly, then returned to the party. Another man came twenty minutes after that,\ndoing the same thing. Hopefully, the women were passing on the information Vin wished: that Vin had\napparently decided to spend an indeterminate amount of time outside, staring at the mists. Those inside\nwouldn't expect her to return anytime soon.\nA few moments after the second messenger returned to the party, a man rushed out and approached\none of the tables. \"You have to come hear this!\" he whispered to the people at the table—the only ones\ncurrently on the patio who had nothing to do with Vin. That group left. Vin smiled. Elend's distraction had\ncome.\nVin jumped into the air, then Pushed against the railing beside her, launching herself across the patio.\nThe women had obviously grown bored, chatting idly to themselves. It took them a few moments to\nnotice Vin's movement. In those moments, Vin shot across the now-empty patio, dress flapping as she\nflew. One of the women opened her mouth to yell.\nVin extinguished her metals, then burned duralumin and brass, Pushing on the emotions of both\nwomen.\nShe'd done this only once before, to Straff Venture. A duralumin-fueled Brass-push was a terrible\nthing; it flattened a person's emotions, making them feel empty, completely void of all feeling. Both\nwomen gasped, and the one who had been standing stumbled to the ground instead, falling silent.\nVin landed hard, her pewter still off lest she mix it with duralumin. She put her pewter back on\nimmediately, however, rolling up to her feet. She took one of the women with an elbow to the stomach,\nthen grabbed her face and slammed it down into the table, knocking her out. The other woman sat\ndazedly on the ground. Vin grimaced, then grabbed the woman by the throat, choking her."

Vin grimaced, then grabbed the woman by the throat, choking her.\nIt felt brutal, but Vin didn't let up until the woman fell unconscious—proven by the fact that she let her\nAllomantic coppercloud fall. Vin sighed, releasing the woman. The unconscious spy slumped to the floor.\nVin turned. Slowswift's young men stood by anxiously. Vin waved them over.\n\"Stash these two in the bushes,\" Vin said quickly, \"then sit at the table. If anyone asks after them, say\nthat you saw them follow me back into the party. Hopefully, that will keep everyone confused.\"\nThe men flushed. \"We—\"\n\"Do as I say or flee,\" Vin snapped. \"Don't argue with me. I left them both alive, and I can't afford to let\nthem report that I've escaped their watch. If they stir, you'll have to knock them out again.\"\nThe men nodded reluctantly.\nVin reached up and unbuttoned her dress, letting the garment fall to the ground and revealing the sleek,\ndark clothing she wore underneath. She gave the dress to the men to hide as well, then moved into the\nbuilding, away from the party. Inside the misty corridor, she found a stairwell, and slipped down it.\nElend's distraction would be in full progress by now. Hopefully, it would last long enough.\n\"That's right,\" Elend said, arms folded, staring down Yomen. \"A duel. Why make the armies fight for the\ncity? You and I could settle this ourselves.\"\nYomen didn't laugh at the ridiculous idea. He simply sat at his table, his thoughtful eyes set in a bald,\ntattooed head, the single bead of atium tied to his forehead sparkling in the lantern-light. The rest of the\ncrowd was reacting just as Elend had expected. Conversations had died, and people had rushed in,\npacking into the main ballroom to watch the confrontation between emperor and king.\n\"Why do you think that I would consent to such a thing?\" Yomen finally asked.\n\"All accounts say that you are a man of honor.\"\n\"But you are not,\" Yomen said, pointing at Elend. \"This very offer proves that. You are an\nAllomancer—there would be no contest between us. What honor would there be in that?\"\nElend didn't really care. He just wanted Yomen occupied as long as possible. \"Then choose a\nchampion,\" he said. \"I'll fight him instead.\"\n\"Only a Mistborn would be a match for you,\" Yomen said.\n\"Then send one against me.\"\n\"Alas, I have none. I won my kingdom through fairness, legality, and the Lord Ruler's grace—not\nthrough threat of assassination, like yourself.\"\nNo Mistborn, you say? Elend thought, smiling. So, your \"fairness, legality, and grace\" don't\npreclude lying? \"You would really let your people die?\" Elend said loudly, sweeping his hand across the\nroom. More and more people were gathering to watch. \"All because of your pride?\"\n\"Pride?\" Yomen said, leaning forward. \"You call it pride to defend your own rule? I call it pride to\nmarch your armies into another man's kingdom, seeking to intimidate him with barbaric monsters.\""

I call it pride to\nmarch your armies into another man's kingdom, seeking to intimidate him with barbaric monsters.\"\n\"Monsters your own Lord Ruler created and used to intimidate and conquer as well,\" Elend said.\nYomen paused. \"Yes, the Lord Ruler created the koloss,\" he said. \"It was his prerogative to determine\nhow they were used. Besides, he kept them far away from civilized cities—yet you march them right up\nto our doorstep.\"\n\"Yes,\" Elend said, \"and they haven't attacked. That's because I can control them as the Lord Ruler\ndid. Wouldn't that suggest that I have inherited his right to rule?\"\nYomen frowned, perhaps noticing that Elend's arguments kept changing—that he was saying whatever\ncame to mind in order to keep the discussion going.\n\"You may be unwilling to save this city,\" Elend said, \"but there are others in it who are wiser. You\ndon't think I came here without allies, do you?\"\nYomen paused again.\n\"Yes,\" Elend said, scanning the crowd. \"You're not just fighting me, Yomen. You're fighting your own\npeople. Which ones will betray you, when the time comes? How well can you trust them, exactly?\"\nYomen snorted. \"Idle threats, Venture. What is this really about?\" However, Elend could tell that his\nwords bothered Yomen. The man didn't trust the local nobility. He would have been a fool to do so.\nElend smiled, preparing his next argument. He could keep this discussion going for quite some time.\nFor, if there was one thing in particular that he had learned by growing up in his father's house it was this:\nhow to annoy people.\nYou have your distraction, Vin, Elend thought. Let's hope you can end the fight for this city\nbefore it really begins.\nEach spike, positioned very carefully, can determine how the recipient's body is changed by\nHemalurgy. A spike in one place creates a monstrous, near-mindless beast. In another place, a\nspike will create a crafty—yet homicidal—Inquisitor.\nWithout the instinctive knowledge granted by taking the power at the Well of Ascension,\nRashek would never have been able to use Hemalurgy. With his mind expanded, and with a little\npractice, he was able to intuit where to place spikes that would create the servants he wanted.\nIt is a little-known fact that the Inquisitors' torture chambers were actually Hemalurgic\nlaboratories. The Lord Ruler was constantly trying to develop new breeds of servant. It is a\ntestament to Hemalurgy's complexity that, despite a thousand years of trying, he never managed\nto create anything with it beyond the three kinds of creatures he developed during those few brief\nmoments holding the power.\n44\nVIN CREPT DOWN THE STONE STAIRWELL, small sounds echoing eerily from below. She had\nno torch or lantern, and the stairwell was not lit, but enough light reflected up from below to let her\ntin-enhanced eyes see.\nThe more she thought about it, the more the large basement made sense.

This was the Canton of\nResource—the arm of the Ministry that had been in charge of feeding the people, maintaining the canals,\nand supplying the other Cantons. Vin supposed that this basement had once been well stocked with\nsupplies. If the cache really was here, it would be the first that she had discovered hidden beneath a\nCanton of Resource building. Vin expected great things from it. What better place to hide your atium and\nyour most important resources than with an organization that was in charge of transportation and storage\nacross the entire empire?\nThe stairwell was simple, utilitarian, and steep. Vin wrinkled her nose at the musty air, which seemed\nall the more stuffy to her tin-enhanced sense of smell. Still, she was grateful for tin's enhanced vision, not\nto mention the enhanced hearing, which let her hear clinking armor below—an indication that she needed\nto move quite carefully.\nAnd so she did. She reached the bottom of the stairwell and peeked around the corner. Three narrow\nstone corridors split off from the stairwell landing, each heading in a different direction at ninety-degree\nangles. The sounds were coming from the right, and as Vin leaned out a bit more, she nearly jumped as\nshe saw a pair of guards standing lazily against the wall a short distance away.\nGuards standing in the corridors, Vin thought, ducking back into the stairwell. Yomen definitely\nwants to protect something down here.\nVin crouched down on the rough, cool stone. Pewter, steel, and iron were of relatively little use at the\nmoment. She could take down both guards, but it would be risky, since she couldn't afford to make any\nnoise. She didn't know where the cache was—and therefore couldn't afford to make a disturbance, not\nyet.\nVin closed her eyes, burning brass and zinc. She carefully—and slowly—Soothed the emotions of the\ntwo soldiers. She heard them settle back, leaning against the side of the corridor. Then, she Rioted their\nsense of boredom, tugging on that single emotion. She peeked around the corner again, keeping the\npressure on, waiting.\nOne of the men yawned. A few seconds later, the other one did. Then they both yawned at once. And\nVin scuttled straight across the landing and into the shadowed hallway beyond. She pressed herself up\nagainst the wall, heart beating quickly, and waited. No cry came, though one of the guards did mumble\nsomething about being tired.\nVin smiled in excitement. It had been a long time since she'd had to truly sneak. She had spied and\nscouted, but had trusted on the mists, the darkness, and her ability to move quickly to protect her. This\nwas different. It reminded her of the days when she and Reen had burgled houses.\nWhat would my brother say now? she wondered, padding down the corridor on unnaturally light,\nquiet feet. He'd think I've gone crazy, sneaking into a building not for wealth, but for information.\nTo Reen, life had been about survival—the simple, harsh facts of survival. Trust nobody. Make yourself\ninvaluable to your team, but don't be too threatening. Be ruthless. Stay alive.\nShe hadn't abandoned his lessons. They'd always be part of her—they were what had kept her alive"

They'd always be part of her—they were what had kept her alive\nand careful, even during her years with Kelsier's crew. She just no longer listened to them exclusively.\nShe tempered them with trust and hope.\nYour trust will get you killed someday, Reen seemed to whisper in the back of her mind. But, of\ncourse, even Reen himself hadn't stuck to his code perfectly. He'd died protecting Vin, refusing to give\nher up to the Inquisitors, even though doing so might have saved his life.\nVin continued forward. It soon became evident that the basement was an extensive grid of narrow\ncorridors surrounding larger rooms. She peeked into one, creaking the door open, and found some\nsupplies. They were basic kinds of things, flour and the like—not the carefully canned, organized, and\ncatalogued long-term supplies of a storage cache.\nThere must be a loading dock down one of these corridors, Vin guessed. It probably slopes up,\nleading to that subcanal that runs into the city.\nVin moved on, but she knew she wouldn't have time to search each of the basement's many rooms.\nShe approached another intersection of corridors, and crouched down, frowning. Elend's diversion\nwouldn't last forever, and someone would eventually discover the women she'd knocked unconscious.\nShe needed to get to the cache quickly.\nShe glanced around. The corridors were sparsely lit by the occasional lamp. Yet, there seemed to be\nmore light coming from the left. She moved down this corridor, and the lamps became more frequent.\nSoon, she caught the sound of voices, and she moved more carefully, approaching another intersection.\nShe peeked down it. To the left, she noted a pair of soldiers standing in the distance. To her right, there\nwere four.\nRight it is, then, she thought. However, this was going to be a little more difficult.\nShe closed her eyes, listening carefully. She could hear both groups of soldiers, but there seemed to be\nsomething else. Other groups in the distance. Vin picked one of these and begin to Pull with a powerful\nRiot of emotions. Soothing and Rioting weren't blocked by stone or steel—during the days of the Final\nEmpire, the Lord Ruler had set up Soothers in various sections of the skaa slums, letting them Soothe\naway the emotions of everyone nearby, affecting hundreds, even thousands, of people at once.\nShe waited. Nothing happened. She was trying to Riot the men's sense of anger and irritability.\nHowever, she didn't even know if she was Pulling in the right direction. In addition, Rioting and Soothing\nweren't as precise as Pushing steel. Breeze always explained that the emotional makeup of a person was\na complex jumble of thoughts, instincts, and feelings. An Allomancer couldn't control minds or actions.\nHe could only nudge.\nUnless . . .\nTaking a deep breath, Vin extinguished all of her metals. Then, she burned duralumin and zinc, and\nPulled in the direction of the distant guards, hitting them with a powerfully enhanced burst of emotional\nAllomancy.\nImmediately, a curse echoed through the hallway. Vin cringed. Fortunately, the noise wasn't directed"

Fortunately, the noise wasn't directed\nat her. The guards in the corridor perked up, and the argument in the distance grew louder, more fervent.\nVin didn't need to burn tin to hear when the scuffle broke out, men yelling at each other.\nThe guards to the left rushed away, moving to find out what the source of the disturbance was. The\nones to her right left two men behind, however, and so Vin drank a vial of metal, then Rioted their\nemotions, enhancing their senses of curiosity to the point of breaking.\nThe two men left, rushing after their companions, and Vin scurried down the corridor. She soon saw\nthat her instincts had proven right—the four men had been guarding a door into one of the storage rooms.\nVin took a deep breath, then opened the door and ducked inside. The trapdoor inside was closed, but\nshe knew what to look for. She pulled it open, then jumped into the darkness beneath her.\nShe Pushed down a coin as she fell, using the sound of its hitting to let her know how far down the\nfloor was. She landed on rough stonework, standing in complete darkness—pitch black beyond even\nwhat tin would let her see in. She felt around, however, and found a lantern on the wall. She pulled out\nher flint, and soon had light.\nAnd there it was, the door in the wall leading into the storage cavern. The rock mountings had been\ntorn apart, the door forced. The wall was still there, and the door itself was intact, but getting it open had\nobviously taken some great amount of work. The door was open slightly, barely wide enough for a\nperson to get through. It had obviously taken Yomen a lot of effort to even get it that far.\nHe must have known it was here, Vin thought, standing up straight. But . . . why break it open like\nthis? He has a Mistborn who could have opened the door with a Steelpull.\nHeart fluttering in anticipation, Vin slipped through the opening and into the silent storage cache. She\nimmediately jumped down to the cache floor and began searching for the plate that would contain the\nLord Ruler's information. She just had to—\nStone scraped against stone behind her.\nVin spun, feeling an instant of sharp and dreadful realization.\nThe stone door shut behind her.\n\". . . and that,\" Elend said, \"is why the Lord Ruler's system of government had to fall.\"\nHe was losing them. He could tell—more and more people were trailing away from the argument. The\nproblem was, Yomen actually was interested.\n\"You make a mistake, young Venture,\" the obligator said, tapping the table idly with his fork. \"The\nsixth-century stewardship program was not even devised by the Lord Ruler. The newly formed Canton\nof Inquisition proposed it as a means of population control for the Terris, and the Lord Ruler agreed to it\nprovisionally.\"\n\"That provision turned into a means of subjugating an entire race of people,\" Elend said.\n\"That subjugation started far earlier,\" Yomen said. \"Everyone knows the history of this, Venture.

The\nTerris were a people who absolutely refused to submit to imperial rule, and they had to be strictly reined\nin. However, can you honestly say that Terris stewards were treated poorly? They're the most honored\nservants in all of the empire!\"\n\"I'd hardly call being made into a favored slave a fair return for losing one's manhood,\" Elend said,\nraising an eyebrow and folding his arms.\n\"There are at least a dozen sources I could quote you on that,\" Yomen said with a wave of his hand.\n\"What about Trendalan? He claimed that being made a eunuch had left him free to pursue more potent\nthoughts of logic and of harmony, since he wasn't distracted by worldly lusts.\"\n\"He didn't have a choice in the matter,\" Elend said.\n\"Few of us have choice in our stations,\" Yomen replied.\n\"I prefer people to have that choice,\" Elend said. \"You'll notice that I have given the skaa freedom in\nmy lands, and given the nobility a parliamentary council by which they have a hand in ruling the city in\nwhich they live.\"\n\"High ideals,\" Yomen said, \"and I recognize Trendalan's own words in what you claim to have done.\nHowever, even he said that it would be unlikely for such a system to continue in stability for very long.\"\nElend smiled. It had been a long time since he'd had such a good argument. Ham never delved deeply\ninto topics—he liked philosophical questions, but not scholarly debates—and Sazed just didn't like to\nargue.\nI wish I could have met Yomen when I was younger, Elend thought. Back when I had time to\nsimply worry about philosophy. Oh, the discussions we could have had. . . .\nOf course, those discussions probably would have ended up with Elend in the hands of the Steel\nInquisitors for being a revolutionary. Still, he had to admit that Yomen was no fool. He knew his history\nand his politics—he just happened to have completely erroneous beliefs. Another day, Elend would have\nbeen happy to persuade him of that fact.\nUnfortunately, this particular argument was growing increasingly tense for Elend. He couldn't maintain\nboth Yomen's attention and that of the crowd. Each time he tried to do something to get the crowd back,\nYomen seemed to get suspicious—and each time Elend actually tried to engage the king, the crowd itself\ngrew bored with the philosophical debate.\nSo it was that Elend was actually relieved when the yells of surprise finally came. Seconds later, a pair\nof soldiers rushed into the room, carrying a dazed and bloodied young woman in a ball gown.\nLord Ruler, Vin! Elend thought. Was that really necessary?\nElend glanced back at Yomen, and the two shared a look. Then Yomen stood. \"Where is the empress\nVenture!\" he demanded.\nTime to go, Elend thought, remembering his promise to Vin. However, something occurred to him. I'll\nprobably never have another chance to get this close to Yomen, Elend thought. And there's one sure\nway to prove whether or not he's an Allomancer.\nTry to kill him."

Ballgoers began to\ncry out, their idyllic world shattering as Elend whipped out a pair of glass daggers. Yomen paled and\nbacked away. Two guards who had been pretending to be Yomen's dinner partners stood up from their\nseats, pulling staves from beneath the table.\n\"You liar,\" Yomen spat as Elend landed on the dining table. \"Thief, butcher, tyrant!\"\nElend shrugged, then shot coins at the two guards, easily dropping them both. He jumped for Yomen,\ngrabbing the man around the neck, yanking him backward. Gasps and screams came from the crowd.\nElend squeezed, choking Yomen. No strength flooded the man's limbs. No Allomantic Pull or Push\ntried to shake him from Elend's grasp.

He had pewter, and Yomen was still\nmoving with the clumsiness of an unenhanced man. Yet, the attack moved with Elend, somehow\nmanaging to take him in the side. Elend grunted, blood hot on his skin, and he looked into Yomen's eyes.\nThe king pulled the knife free, easily dodging Elend's counterstrike. It was almost like . . .\nElend burned electrum, giving himself a bubble of false atium images. Yomen hesitated immediately,\nlooking confused.\nHe's burning atium, Elend thought with shock.

Vin didn't arrive.\nHe told the others about what had happened. Vin didn't arrive.\nHam forced him to get something to eat. Elend paced for an hour after that, and still Vin did not return.\n\"I'm going back,\" Elend said, standing.\nHam looked up. \"El, you lost a lot of blood.

Beside her, on the rock floor, sat the dwindling lantern she'd brought into the massive room.\nShe'd Pushed and she'd Pulled, trying to force her way out. However, she'd soon realized that the\nbroken stones she'd seen on the outside—the work project she'd assumed had been used to open the\ndoor—had actually had a different purpose. Yomen had apparently removed the metal plates inside the\ndoor, the ones that an Allomancer could Push or Pull on to open it. That left the door as simply a stone\nblock. With duralumin-enhanced pewter, she should have been able to push even that open.\nUnfortunately, she found it difficult to get leverage on the floor, which sloped down away from the block.\nIn addition, they must have done something to the hinges—or perhaps even piled up more rock against\nthe other side—for she couldn't get the door to budge.\nShe ground her teeth in frustration, sitting with her back to the stone door. Yomen had set an\nintentional trap for her. Had she and Elend been that predictable? Regardless, it was a brilliant move."

A Mistborn she could beat, then hold hostage until they released her.\nShe waited until the man was close—she could tell by the beating of the Allomantic pulses that she\nhoped he didn't know she could feel—then spun, kicking her lantern toward him. She jumped forward,\nguiding herself toward her enemy, who stood outlined by the lantern's last flickers. He looked up at her\nas she soared through the air, her daggers out.\nAnd she recognized his face.\nReen.\nPART FOUR\nBEAUTIFUL DESTROYER\nA man with a given power—such as an Allomantic ability—who then gained a Hemalurgic spike\ngranting that same power would be nearly twice as strong as a natural unenhanced Allomancer.\nAn Inquisitor who was a Seeker before his transformation would therefore have an enhanced\nability to use bronze.

His\nposture was familiar to her; during her childhood, he had often stood as he did now, arms folded in\ndisapproval.\nIt all returned to her. Things she thought she'd banished into the dark, quarantined parts of her mind:\nblows from Reen's hand, harsh criticism from his tongue, furtive moves from city to city.\nAnd yet, tempering these memories was an insight. She was no longer the young girl who had borne\nher beatings in confused silence. Looking back, she could see the fear Reen had shown in the things he\nhad done. He'd been terrified that his half-breed Allomancer of a sister would be discovered and\nslaughtered by the Steel Inquisitors. He'd beaten her when she made herself stand out. He'd yelled at her\nwhen she was too competent. He'd moved her when he'd feared that the Canton of Inquisition had\ncaught their trail.\nReen had died protecting her. He had taught her paranoia and distrust out of a twisted sense of duty,\nfor he'd believed that was the only way she would survive on the streets of the Final Empire. And, she'd\nstayed with him, enduring the treatment. Inside—not even buried all that deeply—she'd known something\nvery important. Reen had loved her.\nShe looked up and met the eyes of the man standing in the cavern. Then, she slowly shook her head.\nNo, she thought. It looks like him, but those eyes are not his.\n\"Who are you?\" she demanded.\n\"I'm your brother,\" the creature said, frowning. \"It's only been a few years, Vin. You've grown\nbrash—I thought I'd taught you better than that.\"\nHe certainly has the mannerisms down, Vin thought, walking forward warily. How did he learn\nthem? Nobody thought that Reen was of any importance during his life. They wouldn't have\nknown to study him.\n\"Where did you get his bones?\" Vin asked, circling the creature. The cavern floor was rough and lined\nwith burgeoning shelves. Darkness extended in all directions. \"And how did you get the face so perfect? I\nthought kandra had to digest a body to make a good copy.\"\nHe had to be a kandra, after all. How else would someone manage such a perfect imitation? The\ncreature turned, regarding her with a confused expression. \"What is this nonsense? Vin, I realize that\nwe're not exactly the type to reunite with a fond embrace, but I did at least expect you to recognize me.\"\nVin ignored the complaints. Reen, then Breeze, had taught her too well. She'd know Reen if she saw\nhim. \"I need information,\" she said. \"About one of your kind. He is called TenSoon, and he returned to\nyour Homeland a year ago. He said he was going to be put on trial. Do you know what happened to\nhim? I would like to contact him, if possible.\"\n\"Vin,\" the false Reen said firmly, \"I am not a kandra.\"\nWe'll see about that, Vin thought, reaching out with zinc and hitting the impostor with a\nduralumin-fueled blast of emotional Allomancy.\nHe didn't even stumble.

It was growing difficult to see the impostor in the waning lantern-light, even with tin\nenhancing her eyes.\nThe failed emotional Allomancy meant that he wasn't a kandra. But he wasn't Reen either. There\nseemed only one logical course to follow.\nShe attacked.\nWhoever the impostor was, he knew her well enough to anticipate this move. Though he exclaimed in\nmock surprise, he immediately jumped back, getting out of her reach. He moved on light feet—light\nenough that Vin was reasonably certain he was burning pewter. In fact, she could still feel the Allomantic\npulses coming from him, though for some reason it was hard for her to pin down exactly which metals he\nwas burning.\nEither way, the Allomancy was an additional confirmation of her suspicions. Reen had not been an\nAllomancer. True, he could have Snapped during their time apart, but she didn't think he had any noble\nblood to impart him an Allomantic heritage. Vin had gotten her powers from her father, the parent she\nand Reen had not shared.\nShe attacked experimentally, testing this impostor's skill. He stayed out of her reach, watching carefully\nas she alternately prowled and attacked. She tried to corner him against the shelves, but he was too\ncareful to be caught.\n\"This is pointless,\" the impostor said, jumping away from her again.\nNo coins, Vin thought. He doesn't use coins to jump.\n\"You'd have to expose yourself too much to actually hit me, Vin,\" the impostor said, \"and I'm\nobviously good enough to stay out of your reach. Can't we stop this and get on to more important\nmatters? Aren't you even a bit curious as to what I've been doing these last four years?\"\nVin backed into a crouch, like a cat preparing to pounce, and smiled.\n\"What?\" the impostor asked.\nAt that moment, her stalling paid off. Behind them, the overturned lantern finally flickered out, plunging\nthe cavern into darkness. But Vin, with her ability to pierce copperclouds, could still sense her enemy.\nShe'd dropped her coin pouch back when she'd first sensed someone in the room—she bore no metal to\ngive him warning of her approach.\nShe launched herself forward, intending to grab her enemy around the neck and pull him into a pin.\nThe Allomantic pulses didn't let her see him, but they did tell her exactly where he was. That would be\nenough of an edge.\nShe was wrong. He dodged her just as easily as he had before.\nVin fell still. Tin, she thought. He can hear me coming.\nSo, she kicked over a storage shelf, then attacked again as the crash of the falling shelf echoed loudly\nin the chamber, spilling cans across the floor.\nThe impostor evaded her again. Vin froze. Something was very wrong. Somehow, he always sensed\nher. The cavern fell silent. Neither sound nor light bounced off its walls. Vin crouched, the fingers of one\nhand resting lightly on the cool stone before her. She could feel the thumping, his Allomantic power"

She could feel the thumping, his Allomantic power\nwashing across her in waves. She focused on it, trying to differentiate the metals that had produced it.\nYet, the pulses felt opaque. Muddled.\nThere's something familiar about them, she realized. When I first sensed this impostor, I thought\n. . . I thought he was the mist spirit.\nThere was a reason the pulses felt familiar. Without the light to distract her, making her connect the\nfigure with Reen, she could see what she'd been missing.\nHer heart began to beat quickly, and for the first time this evening—imprisonment included—she\nbegan to feel afraid. The pulses felt just like the ones she'd felt a year ago. The pulses that had led her to\nthe Well of Ascension.\n\"Why have you come here?\" she whispered to the blackness.\nLaughter. It rang in the empty cavern, loud, free. The thumpings approached, though no footsteps\nmarked the thing's movement. The pulses suddenly grew enormous and overpowering. They washed\nacross Vin, unbounded by the cavern's echoes, an unreal sound that passed through things both living and\ndead. She stepped backward in the darkness, and nearly tripped over the shelves she'd knocked down.\nI should have known you wouldn't be fooled, a kindly voice said in her head. The thing's voice.\nShe'd heard it only once before, a year ago, when she'd released it from its imprisonment in the Well of\nAscension.\n\"What do you want?\" she whispered.\nYou know what I want. You've always known.\nAnd she did. She had sensed it in the moment when she had touched the thing. Ruin, she called it. It\nhad very simple desires. To see the world come to its end.\n\"I will stop you,\" she said. Yet, it was hard to not feel foolish speaking the words to a force she did not\nunderstand, a thing that existed beyond men and beyond worlds.\nIt laughed again, though this time the sound was only inside her head. She could still feel Ruin\npulsing—though not from any one specific place. It surrounded her. She forced herself to stand up\nstraight.\nAh, Vin, Ruin said, its voice almost fatherly in tone. You act as if I were your enemy.\n\"You are my enemy. You seek to end the things I love.\"\nAnd is an ending always bad? it asked. Must not all things, even worlds, someday end?\n\"There is no need to hasten that end,\" Vin said. \"No reason to force it.\"\nAll things are subject to their own nature, Vin, Ruin said, seeming to flow around her. She could\nfeel its touch upon her—wet and delicate, like mist. You cannot blame me for being what I am.\nWithout me, nothing would end. Nothing could end. And therefore, nothing could grow. I am life.\nWould you fight life itself?\nVin fell silent.\nDo not mourn because the day of this world's end has arrived, Ruin said. That end was ordained\nthe very day of the world's conception. There is a beauty in death—the beauty of finality, the\nbeauty of completion.\nFor nothing is truly complete until the day it is finally destroyed."

There is a beauty in death—the beauty of finality, the\nbeauty of completion.\nFor nothing is truly complete until the day it is finally destroyed.\n\"Enough,\" Vin snapped, feeling alone and smothered in the chill darkness. \"Stop taunting me. Why\nhave you come here?\"\nCome here? it asked. Why do you ask that?\n\"What is your purpose in appearing now?\" Vin said. \"Have you simply come to gloat over my\nimprisonment?\"\nI have not \"just appeared,\" Vin, Ruin said. Why, I have never left. I've always been with you. A\npart of you.\n\"Nonsense,\" Vin said. \"You only just revealed yourself.\"\nI revealed myself to your eyes, yes, Ruin said. But, I see that you do not understand. I've always\nbeen with you, even when you could not see me.\nIt paused, and there was silence, both outside and inside of her head.\nWhen you're alone, no one can betray you, a voice whispered in the back of her mind. Reen's voice.\nThe voice she heard sometimes, almost real, like a conscience. She'd taken it for granted that the voice\nwas just part of her psyche—a leftover from Reen's teachings. An instinct.\nAnyone will betray you, Vin, the voice said, repeating a bit of advice it commonly gave. As it spoke,\nit slowly slid from Reen's voice into that of Ruin. Anyone.\nI've always been with you. You've heard me in your mind since your first years of life.\nRuin's escape deserves some explanation. This is a thing that even I had a problem understanding.\nRuin could not have used the power at the Well of Ascension. It was of Preservation, Ruin's\nfundamental opposite. Indeed, a direct confrontation of these two forces would have caused the\ndestruction of both.\nRuin's prison, however, was fabricated of that power. Therefore, it was attuned to the power of\nPreservation—the very power of the Well. When that power was released and dispersed, rather\nthan utilized, it acted as a key. The subsequent \"unlocking\" is what finally freed Ruin.\n46\n\"ALL RIGHT,\" BREEZE SAID, \"so does somebody want to speculate on how our team's spy\nended up becoming a pseudo-religious vigilante freedom fighter?\"\nSazed shook his head. They sat in their cavern lair beneath the Canton of Inquisition. Breeze, declaring\nthat he was tired of travel rations, had ordered several of the soldiers to break open some of the cavern's\nsupplies to prepare a more suitable meal. Sazed might have complained, but the truth was that the cavern\nwas so well stocked that even a determinedly eating Breeze wouldn't be able to make a dent in it.\nThey had waited all day for Spook to return to the lair. Tensions in the city were high, and most of\ntheir contacts had gone to ground, weathering the Citizen's paranoia regarding a rebellion. Soldiers\nwalked the streets, and a sizable contingent had set up camp just outside the Ministry building. Sazed\nwas worried that the Citizen had associated Breeze and Sazed with Spook's appearance at the\nexecutions. It appeared that their days of moving about freely in the city were at an end."

It appeared that their days of moving about freely in the city were at an end.\n\"Why hasn't he come back?\" Allrianne asked. She and Breeze sat at a fine table, pilfered from an\nempty nobleman's mansion. They had, of course, changed back to their fine clothing—a suit on Breeze, a\npeach dress on Allrianne. They always changed as soon as possible, as if eager to reaffirm to themselves\nwho they really were.\nSazed did not dine with them; he didn't have much of an appetite. Captain Goradel leaned against a\nbookcase a short distance away, determined to keep a close eye on his charges. Though the\ngood-natured man wore his usual smile, Sazed could tell from the orders he'd given to his soldiers that he\nwas worried about the possibility of an assault. He made very certain that Breeze, Allrianne, and Sazed\nstayed within the protective confines of the cavern. Better to be trapped than dead.\n\"I'm sure the boy is fine, my dear,\" Breeze said, finally answering Allrianne's question. \"It's likely he\nhasn't come back because he fears implicating us in what he did today.\"\n\"Either that,\" Sazed said, \"or he can't get past the soldiers watching outside.\"\n\"He snuck into a burning building while we were watching, my dear man,\" Breeze said, \"I doubt he'd\nhave trouble with a bunch of toughs, especially now that it's dark out.\"\nAllrianne shook her head. \"It would have been better if he'd managed to sneak out of that building as\nwell, rather than jumping off the roof in front of everyone.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Breeze said. \"But, part of being a vigilante rebel is letting your enemies know what you are\nabout. The psychological effect produced by leaping from a burning building carrying a child is quite\nsound. And, to do that right in front of the tyrant who tried to execute said child? I wasn't aware that dear\nlittle Spook had such a flair for drama!\"\n\"He's not so little anymore, I think,\" Sazed said quietly. \"We have a habit of ignoring Spook too\nmuch.\"\n\"Habits come from reinforcement, my dear man,\" Breeze said, wagging a fork at Sazed. \"We paid little\nattention to the lad because he rarely had an important role to play. It isn't his fault—he was simply\nyoung.\"\n\"Vin was young as well,\" Sazed noted.\n\"Vin, you must admit, is something of a special case.\"\nSazed couldn't argue with that.\n\"Either way,\" Breeze said, \"when we look at the facts, what happened isn't really all that surprising.\nSpook has had months to become known to Urteau's underground population, and he is of the Survivor's\nown crew. It is logical that they would begin to look to him to save them, much as Kelsier saved\nLuthadel.\"\n\"We're forgetting one thing, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"He jumped from a rooftop ledge two stories\nup and landed on a cobbled street. Men do not survive falls like that without broken bones.\"\nBreeze paused. \"Staged, you think? Perhaps he worked out some kind of landing platform to soften\nthe fall?\""

Perhaps he worked out some kind of landing platform to soften\nthe fall?\"\nSazed shook his head. \"I believe it a stretch to assume that Spook could plan, and execute, a staged\nrescue like that. He would have needed the aid of the underground, which would have ruined the effect.\nIf they knew that his survival was a trick, then we wouldn't have heard the rumors we did about him.\"\n\"What, then?\" Breeze asked, shooting a glance at Allrianne. \"You're not truly suggesting that Spook\nhas been Mistborn all this time, are you?\"\n\"I do not know,\" Sazed said softly.\nBreeze shook his head, chuckling. \"I doubt he could have hidden that from us, my dear man. Why, he\nwould have had to go through that entire mess of overthrowing the Lord Ruler, then the fall of Luthadel,\nwithout ever revealing that he was anything more than a Tineye! I refuse to accept that.\"\nOr, Sazed thought, you refuse to accept that you wouldn't have detected the truth. Still, Breeze\nhad a point. Sazed had known Spook as a youth. The boy had been awkward and shy, but he hadn't\nbeen deceitful. It was truly a stretch to imagine him to have been a Mistborn from the beginning.\nYet, Sazed had seen that fall. He had seen the grace of the jump, the distinctive poise and natural\ndexterity of one burning pewter. Sazed found himself wishing for his copperminds so that he could search\nfor references about people spontaneously manifesting Allomantic powers. Could a man be a Misting\nearly in life, then transform to a full Mistborn later?\nIt was a simple thing, related to his duties as an ambassador. Perhaps he could spend just a little time\nlooking through his stored memories, seeking examples. . . .\nHe paused. Don't be silly, he thought. You're just looking for excuses. You know that it's\nimpossible for an Allomancer to gain new powers. You won't find any examples because there\naren't any.\nHe didn't need to look through his metalminds. He had set those aside for a very good reason—he\ncould not be a Keeper, could not share the knowledge he'd collected, until he could sort the truth from\nthe lies.\nI've let myself get distracted lately, he thought with determination, rising from his place and leaving\nthe others behind. He walked over to his \"room\" in the cache, with the sheets hung there cutting off his\nview of the others. Sitting on the table was his portfolio. In the corner, next to a shelf full of cans, sat his\nsack full of metalminds.\nNo, Sazed thought. I made a promise to myself. I will keep it. I will not allow myself to become a\nhypocrite simply because some new religion appears and waves at me. I will be strong.\nHe sat down at the table, opening his portfolio, taking out the next sheet in the line. It listed the tenets\nof the Nelazan people, who had worshipped the god Trell.

He'd saved it for near the\nend, but had done so more out of worry than anything else. He'd wanted to put off what he'd known\nwould happen.\nSure enough, as he read about the religion, he saw the holes in its doctrines. True, the Nelazan had\nknown a great deal about astronomy, but their teachings on the afterlife were sketchy—almost whimsical.\nTheir doctrine was purposefully vague, they'd taught, allowing all men to discover truth for themselves.\nReading this, however, left Sazed frustrated. What good was a religion without answers? Why believe in\nsomething if the response to half of his questions was \"Ask Trell, and he will answer\"?\nHe didn't dismiss the religion immediately. He forced himself to put it aside, acknowledging to himself\nthat he wasn't in the right mood for studying. He didn't feel like he was in the mood for much, actually.\nWhat if Spook really has become Mistborn? he wondered, mind getting drawn back to the previous\nconversation. It seemed impossible. Yet, a lot of things they thought they'd known about\nAllomancy—such as the existence of only ten metals—had turned out to be falsehoods taught by the\nLord Ruler to hide some powerful secrets.\nPerhaps it was possible for an Allomancer to spontaneously manifest new powers. Or, perhaps there\nwas a more mundane reason Spook had managed such a long fall. It could be related to the thing that\nmade Spook's eyes so sensitive. Drugs, perhaps?\nEither way, Sazed's worry about what was happening kept him from being able to focus on studying\nthe Nelazan religion as he should. He kept getting the feeling that something very important was\noccurring. And Spook was at the center of it.\nWhere was that boy?\n\"I know why you're so sad,\" Spook said.\nBeldre turned, shock showing on her face. She didn't see him at first. He must have been too deep in\nthe misty shadows. It was growing hard for him to tell.\nHe stepped forward, moving across the plot of land that had once been a garden outside the Citizen's\nhome. \"I figured it out,\" Spook said. \"At first, I thought that sadness had to do with this garden. It must\nhave been beautiful, once. You would have seen it in its fullness, before your brother ordered all gardens\nplowed under. You were related to nobility, and probably lived in their society.\"\nShe looked surprised at this.\n\"Yes, I know,\" Spook said. \"Your brother is an Allomancer. He's a Coinshot; I felt his Pushes. That\nday at Marketpit.\"\nShe remained silent—more beautiful herself than the garden could ever have been—though she did\ntake a step backward as her eyes finally found him in the mists.\n\"Eventually,\" Spook continued, \"I decided that I must be wrong. Nobody mourns so much for a simple\ngarden, no matter how lovely. After that, I thought the sadness in your eyes must come from being\nforbidden to take part in your brother's councils.

He didn't look toward it; he kept his eyes on her.\n\"I was wrong,\" he said. \"Being forbidden your brother's conferences would lead to frustration, but not\nsuch pain. Not such regret.

What I'm trying figure out is why\nyou feel it.\"\nShe turned away. \"You shouldn't be here,\" she said. \"There are guards watching—\"\n\"No,\" Spook said. \"Not anymore. Quellion sent too many men into the city—he's afraid that he'll suffer\na revolution, like happened in Luthadel. Like he himself inspired here when he seized power. He's right to\nbe afraid, but he was wrong to leave his own palace so poorly guarded.\"\n\"Kill him,\" Kelsier whispered. \"Quellion is inside; this is the perfect chance. He deserves it, you know\nhe does.\"\nNo, Spook thought. Not today. Not in front of her.\nBeldre glanced back at him, her eyes growing hard. \"Why have you come? To taunt me?\"\n\"To tell you that I understand,\" Spook said.\n\"How can you say that?\" she said. \"You don't understand me—you don't know me.\"\n\"I think I do,\" Spook said. \"I saw your eyes today, when you watched those people being marched to\ntheir deaths. You feel guilty. Guilty for your brother's murders. You sorrow because you feel you should\nbe able to stop him.\" He took a step forward. \"You can't, Beldre. He's been corrupted by his power. He\nmight once have been a good man, but no longer. Do you realize what he's doing? Your brother is\nmurdering people simply to get Allomancers. He captures them, then threatens to kill their families unless\nthey do as he asks. Are those the actions of a good man?\"\n\"You are a simplistic fool,\" Beldre whispered, though she wouldn't meet his eyes.\n\"I know,\" Spook said. \"What are a few deaths when it comes to securing the stability of a kingdom?\"\nHe paused, then shook his head. \"He's killing children, Beldre. And he's doing it simply to cover up the\nfact that he's gathering Allomancers.\"\nBeldre was silent for a moment. \"Go,\" she finally said.\n\"I want you to come with me.\"\nShe looked up.\n\"I'm going to overthrow your brother,\" Spook said. \"I am a member of the Survivor's own crew.

He stayed where he was, however, calling her bluff.\nAnd so she started screaming.\n\"Go kill him!\" Kelsier said over her screams. \"Now, before it's too late! Those guards you killed—they\nwere just following orders. Quellion, he's the true monster.\"\nSpook ground his teeth in frustration, then finally ran, fleeing from Beldre and her screams, leaving\nQuellion alive.\nFor the moment.\nThe group of rings, clasps, ear loops, bracelets, and other bits of metal gleamed on the table like a\ntreasure hoard of legend. Of course, most of the metals were rather mundane. Iron, steel, tin, copper. No\ngold or atium.\nYet, to a Feruchemist, the metals were worth far more than their economic value. They were batteries,\nstores that could be filled, then drawn upon. One made of pewter, for instance, could be filled with\nstrength. Filling it would drain the Feruchemist of strength for a time—making him weak enough that\nsimple tasks grew difficult—but the price was worthwhile. For, when necessary, he could draw that\nstrength forth.\nMany of these metalminds, spread out on the table in front of Sazed, were empty at the moment.\nSazed had last used them during the horrific battle that had ended with the fall—then rescue—of Luthadel\nover a year before. That battle had left him drained in more ways than one. Ten rings, lined up on the side\nof the table, had been used to nearly kill him. Marsh had shot them at Sazed like coins, piercing his skin.\nThat, however, had allowed Sazed to draw forth their power and heal himself.\nAt the very center of the collection were the most important metalminds of all. Four bracers—meant to\nclasp on to the upper or lower arms—sat gleaming and polished, made of the purest copper. They were\nthe largest of his metalminds, for they held the most. Copper carried memories. A Feruchemist could\ntake images, thoughts, or sounds that were fresh in his mind, then store them away. While inside, they\nwouldn't decay or change, as memories could while held in the mind.\nWhen Sazed had been a young man, an older Feruchemist had read out the entire contents of his\ncopperminds. Sazed had stored the knowledge in his own copperminds; they contained the sum total of\nKeeper knowledge. The Lord Ruler had worked hard to smother people's memories of the past.

        "text": "Keeper knowledge. The Lord Ruler had worked hard to smother people's memories of the past. But the\nKeepers had gathered them—stories of how the world had been before the ash came and the sun had\nturned red. The Keepers had memorized the names of places and of kingdoms, had gathered the wisdom\nof those who were lost.\nAnd they had memorized the religions that had been forbidden by the Lord Ruler. These he had\nworked the most diligently to destroy, and so the Keepers had worked with equal diligence to rescue\nthem—to secure them away inside of metalminds, so someday they could be taught again. Above all, the\nKeepers had searched for one thing: knowledge of their own religion, the beliefs of the Terris people.\nThose had been forgotten during the destructive chaos following the Lord Ruler's ascension. However,\ndespite centuries of work, the Keepers had never recovered this most precious knowledge of all.\nI wonder what would have happened if we had found it, Sazed thought, picking up a steelmind and\nquietly polishing it. Probably nothing. He'd given up on his work with the religions in his portfolio for the\nmoment, feeling too discouraged to study.\nThere were fifty religions left in his portfolio. Why was he deluding himself, hoping to find any more\ntruth in them than he had in the previous two hundred and fifty? None of the religions had managed to\nsurvive the years. Shouldn't he just let them be? Looking through them seemed to be part of the great\nfallacy in the work of the Keepers. They'd struggled to remember the beliefs of men, but those beliefs\nhad already proven they lacked the resilience to survive. Why bring them back to life? That seemed as\npointless as reviving a sickly animal so it could fall to predators again.\nHe continued to polish. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Breeze watching him. The Soother had\ncome to Sazed's \"room,\" complaining that he couldn't sleep, not with Spook still outside somewhere.\nSazed had nodded, but continued polishing. He didn't wish to get into a conversation; he just wanted to\nbe alone.\nBreeze, unfortunately, stood and came over. \"Sometimes, I don't understand you, Sazed,\" Breeze\nsaid.\n\"I do not endeavor to be mysterious, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said, moving on to polish a small bronze\nring.\n\"Why take such good care of them?\" Breeze asked. \"You never wear them anymore. In fact, you\nseem to spurn them.\"\n\"I do not spurn the metalminds, Lord Breeze. They are, in a way, the only sacred thing I have left in\nmy life.\"\n\"But you don't wear them, either.\"\nSazed continued polishing. \"No. I do not.\"\n\"But why?\" Breeze asked. \"You think that she would have wanted this? She was a Keeper too—do\nyou honestly think she'd want you to give up your metalminds?\"\n\"This particular habit of mine is not about Tindwyl.\"\n\"Oh?\" Breeze asked, sighing as he seated himself at the table. \"What do you mean? Because honestly,\nSazed, you're confusing me. I understand people. It bothers me that I can't understand you.\"\n\"After the Lord Ruler's death,\" Sazed said, putting down the ring, \"do you know what I spent my time\ndoing?\""

They weren't interested in\nthe religions of the past. And why should they have been? Why worship something that people used to\nbelieve in?\"\n\"People are always interested in the past, Sazed.\"\n\"Interested, perhaps,\" Sazed said, \"but interest is not faith. These metalminds, they are a thing of\nmuseums and old libraries. They are of little use to modern people. During the years of the Lord Ruler's\nreign, we Keepers pretended that we were doing vital work. We believed that we were doing vital\nwork. And yet, in the end, nothing we did had any real value. Vin didn't need this knowledge to kill the\nLord Ruler.\n\"I am probably the last of the Keepers. The thoughts in these metalminds will die with me. And, at\ntimes, I can't make myself regret that fact. This is not an era for scholars and philosophers. Scholars and\nphilosophers do not help feed starving children.\"\n\"And so you don't wear them anymore?\" Breeze said. \"Because you think they're useless?\"\n\"More than that,\" Sazed said. \"To wear these metalminds would be to pretend. I would be pretending\nthat I find the things in them to be of use, and I have not yet decided if I do or not. To wear them now\nwould seem like a betrayal. I set them aside, for I can do them no justice. I'm just not ready to believe, as\nwe did before, that gathering knowledge and religions is more important than taking action. Perhaps if the\nKeepers had fought, rather than just memorized, the Lord Ruler would have fallen centuries ago.\"\n\"But you resisted, Sazed,\" Breeze said. \"You fought.\"\n\"I don't represent myself any longer, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said softly. \"I represent all Keepers, since I\nam apparently the last. And I, as the last, do not believe in the things I once taught. I cannot with good\nconscience imply that I am the Keeper I once was.\"\nBreeze sighed, shaking his head. \"You don't make sense.\"\n\"It makes sense to me.\"\n\"No, I think you're just confused. This may not seem to you like a world for scholars, my dear friend,\nbut I think you'll be proven wrong. It seems to me that now—suffering in the darkness that might just be\nthe end of everything—is when we need knowledge the most.\"\n\"Why?\" Sazed said. \"So I can teach a dying man a religion that I don't believe? To speak of a god,\nwhen I know there is no such being?\"\nBreeze leaned forward. \"Do you really believe that? That nothing is watching over us?\"\nSazed sat quietly, slowing in his polishing. \"I have yet to decide for certain,\" he finally said. \"At times, I\nhave hoped to find some truth. However, today, that hope seems very distant to me. There is a darkness"

I am not sure that I want to fight it.\"\nBreeze looked troubled at that. He opened his mouth, but before he could respond, a rumble rolled\nthrough the cavern. The rings and bracers on the table quivered and clinked together as the entire room\nshook, and there was a clatter as some foodstuffs fell—though not too many, for Captain Goradel's men\nhad done good work in moving most of the stockpile off of shelves and to the ground, in order to deal\nwith the quakes.\nEventually, the shaking subsided. Breeze sat with a white face, looking up at the ceiling of the cavern.\n\"I tell you, Sazed,\" he said. \"Every time one of those quakes comes, I wonder at the wisdom of hiding in\na cave. Not the safest place during an earthquake, I should think.\"\n\"We really have no other option at the moment,\" Sazed said.\n\"True, I suppose. Do . . . does it seem to you like those quakes are coming more frequently?\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said, picking up a few fallen bracelets from the floor. \"Yes, they are.\"\n\"Maybe . . . this region is just more prone to them,\" Breeze said, not sounding convinced. He turned,\nlooking to the side as Captain Goradel rounded a shelf and approached them in a rush.\n\"Ah, come to check on us, I see,\" Breeze said. \"We survived the quake quite handily. No need for\nurgency, my dear captain.\"\n\"It's not that,\" Goradel said, puffing slightly. \"It's Lord Spook. He's back.\"\nSazed and Breeze shared a look, then rose from their chairs, following Goradel to the front of the\ncavern. They found Spook walking down the steps. His eyes were uncovered, and Sazed saw a new\nhardness in the young man's expression.\nWe really haven't been paying enough attention to the lad.\nThe soldiers backed away. There was blood on Spook's clothing, though he didn't appear wounded.\nHis cloak was burned in places, and the bottom ended in a charred rip.\n\"Good,\" Spook said, noticing Breeze and Sazed, \"you're here. Did that quake cause any damage?\"\n\"Spook?\" Breeze asked. \"No, we're all fine here. No damage. But—\"\n\"We have little time for chatter, Breeze,\" Spook said, walking past them. \"Emperor Venture wants\nUrteau, and we're going to deliver it to him. I need you to start spreading rumors in the city. It should be\neasy—some of the more important elements in the underworld already know the truth.\"\n\"What truth?\" Breeze asked, joining Sazed as they followed Spook through the cavern.\n\"That Quellion is using Allomancers,\" Spook said, his voice echoing in the cavern. \"I've now confirmed\nwhat I suspected before—Quellion recruits Mistings from the people he arrests. He rescues them from\nhis own fires, then holds their families hostage. He relies on the very thing he's preaching against. The\nentire foundation for his rule, therefore, is a lie. Exposing that lie should cause the entire system to\ncollapse.\""

Spook kept\nwalking, and Sazed followed, trailing Spook as he moved through the cavern. Breeze moved away,\nprobably to fetch Allrianne.\nSpook stopped beside the water's edge. He stood there for a moment, then turned toward Sazed.\n\"You said that you have been studying the construction that brought the water down here, diverting it\nfrom the canals.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said.\n\"Is there a way to reverse the process?\" Spook asked. \"Make the water flood the streets again?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Sazed said. \"I am not certain that I have the engineering expertise to accomplish the feat,\nhowever.\"\n\"Is there knowledge in your metalminds that would help you?\" Spook asked.\n\"Well . . . yes.\"\n\"Then use them,\" Spook said.\nSazed paused, looking uncomfortable.\n\"Sazed,\" Spook said. \"We don't have much time—we have to take this city before Quellion decides to\nattack and destroy us. Breeze is going to spread the rumors, then I am going to find a way to expose\nQuellion as a liar before his people. He's an Allomancer himself.\"\n\"Will that be enough?\"\n\"It will if we give them someone else to follow,\" Spook said, turning back to look across the waters.\n\"Someone who can survive fires; someone who can restore water to the city streets. We'll give them\nmiracles and a hero, then expose their leader as a hypocrite and a tyrant. Confronted with that, what\nwould you do?\"\nSazed didn't respond immediately. Spook made good points, even about Sazed's metalminds still\nbeing useful. Yet Sazed wasn't certain what he thought of the changes in the young man. Spook seemed\nto have grown far more competent, but . . .\n\"Spook,\" Sazed said, stepping in closer, speaking quietly enough that the soldiers standing behind\ncouldn't hear. \"What is it you aren't sharing with us? How did you survive the leap from that building?\nWhy do you cover your eyes with cloth?\"\n\"I . . .\" Spook faltered, showing a hint of the insecure boy he had once been. For some reason, seeing\nthat made Sazed more comfortable. \"I don't know if I can explain, Saze,\" Spook said, some of his\npretension evaporating. \"I'm still trying to figure it out myself. I'll explain eventually. For now, can you just\ntrust me?\"\nThe lad had always been a sincere one. Sazed searched those eyes, so eager.\nAnd found something important. Spook cared. He cared about this city, about overthrowing the\nCitizen. He'd saved those people earlier, when Sazed and Breeze had just stood outside, watching.\nSpook cared, and Sazed did not. Sazed tried—he grew frustrated with himself because of his\ndepression, which had been worse this evening than it usually was.\nHis emotions had been so traitorous lately.

He had trouble studying, had trouble leading, had trouble\nbeing of any use whatsoever. But, looking into Spook's eager eyes, he was almost able to forget his\ntroubles for a moment.\nIf the lad wanted to take the lead, then who was Sazed to argue?\nHe glanced toward his room, where the metalminds lay. He had gone so long without them. They\ntempted him with their knowledge.\nAs long as I don't preach the religions they contain, he thought, I'm not a hypocrite. Using this\nspecific knowledge Spook requests will, at least, bring some small meaning to the suffering of\nthose who worked to gather knowledge of engineering.\nIt seemed a weak excuse. But, in the face of Spook taking the lead and offering a good reason to use\nthe metalminds, it was enough.\n\"Very well,\" Sazed said. \"I shall do as you request.\"\nRuin's prison was not like those that hold men. He wasn't bound by bars. In fact, he could move\nabout freely.\nHis prison, rather, was one of impotence. In the terms of forces and gods, this meant balance. If\nRuin were to push, the prison would push back, essentially rendering Ruin powerless. And because\nmuch of his power was stripped away and hidden, he was unable to affect the world in any but the\nmost subtle of ways.\nI should stop here and clarify something. We speak of Ruin being \"freed\" from his prison. But\nthat is misleading. Releasing the power at the Well tipped the aforementioned balance back\ntoward Ruin, but he was still too weak to destroy the world in the blink of an eye as he yearned to\ndo. This weakness was caused by part of Ruin's power—his very body—having been taken and\nhidden from him.\nWhich was why Ruin became so obsessed with finding the hidden part of his self.\n47\nELEND STOOD IN THE MISTS.\nOnce, he had found them disconcerting. They had been the unknown—something mysterious and\nuninviting, something that belonged to Allomancers and not to ordinary men.\nYet, now he was an Allomancer himself. He stared up at the shifting, swirling, spinning banks of vapor.\nRivers in the sky. He almost felt as if he should get pulled along in some phantom current. When he'd first\ndisplayed Allomantic powers, Vin had explained Kelsier's now-infamous motto. The mists are our\nfriend. They hide us. Protect us. Give us power.\nElend continued to stare upward. It had been three days since Vin's capture.\nI shouldn't have let her go, he thought again, heart twisting within him. I shouldn't have agreed to\nsuch a risky plan.\nVin had always been the one to protect him. What did they do now, when she was in danger? Elend\nfelt so inadequate. Had their situations been reversed, Vin would have found a way to get into the city\nand rescue him. She'd have assassinated Yomen, would have done something.\nAnd yet, Elend didn't have her flair of brash determination. He was too much of a planner and was too\nwell acquainted with politics. He couldn't risk himself to save her. He'd already put himself into danger"

He couldn't leave them behind again and put\nhimself in danger, particularly not by going into Fadrex, where Yomen had already proven himself a\nskilled manipulator.\nNo further word had come from Yomen. Elend expected ransom demands, and was terrified of what\nhe might have to do if they came. Could he trade the fate of the world for Vin's life? No. Vin had faced a\nsimilar decision at the Well of Ascension, and had chosen the right option. Elend had to follow her\nexample, had to be strong.\nYet the thought of her captured came close to paralyzing him with dread. Only the spinning mists\nseemed to somehow comfort him.\nShe'll be all right, he told himself, not for the first time. She's Vin. She'll figure a way out of it.\nShe'll be all right. . . .\nIt felt odd, to Elend, that after a lifetime of finding the mists unsettling he would now find them so\ncomforting. Vin didn't see them that way, not anymore. Elend could sense it in the way she acted, in the\nwords she spoke. She distrusted the mists. Hated them, even. And Elend couldn't really blame her. They\nhad, after all, changed somehow—bringing destruction and death.\nYet, Elend found it hard to distrust the mists. They just felt right. How could they be his enemy? They\nspun, swirling around him just slightly as he burned metals, like leaves spinning in a playful wind. As he\nstood there, they seemed to soothe away his concerns about Vin's captivity, giving him confidence that\nshe would find a way out.\nHe sighed, shaking his head. Who was he to trust his own instincts about the mists over Vin's? She\nhad the instincts born of a lifetime of struggling to survive. What did Elend have? Instincts born of a\nlifetime of partygoing and dancing?\nSound came from behind him. People walking. Elend turned, eyeing a pair of servants carrying Cett in\nhis chair.\n\"That damn Thug isn't around here, is he?\" Cett asked as the servants set him down.\nElend shook his head as Cett waved the servants away. \"No,\" Elend said. \"He's investigating some\nkind of disturbance in the ranks.\"\n\"What happened this time?\" Cett asked.\n\"Fistfight,\" Elend said, turning away, looking back toward Fadrex City's watch fires.\n\"The men are restless,\" Cett said. \"They're a little like koloss, you know. Leave them too long, and\nthey'll get themselves into trouble.\"\nKoloss are like them, actually, Elend thought. We should have seen it earlier. They are men—just\nmen reduced to their most base emotions.\nCett sat quietly in the mists for a time, and Elend continued his contemplations.\nEventually, Cett spoke, his voice uncharacteristically soft. \"She's as good as dead, son. You know\nthat.\"\n\"No, I don't,\" Elend said."

Not with Luthadel in revolt.\" Cett was silent for a moment, then continued. \"Another of my\nraiding parties returned today. They had the same things to report.\"\nThe same news as all the others. Elend had authorized Cett to send soldiers into nearby villages, to\nscare the people, perhaps pillage some supplies. Yet, each of the raiding groups had come back\nempty-handed, bearing the same story.\nThe people in Yomen's kingdom were starving. Villages barely survived. The soldiers hadn't the heart\nto hurt them any further, and there wasn't anything to take, anyway.\nElend turned toward Cett. \"You think me a bad leader, don't you?\"\nCett looked up, then scratched at his beard. \"Yes,\" he admitted. \"But, well . . . Elend, you've got one\nthing going for you as a king that I never did.\"\n\"And that is?\"\nCett shrugged. \"The people like you. Your soldiers trust you, and they know you have too good a\nheart for your own good. You have a strange effect on them. Lads like those, they should have been\neager to rob villages, even poor ones.

But, well . . . with the world falling apart as it is, I think even I would rather have\nsomeone to trust, as opposed to someone to fear. I guess that's why the soldiers act as they do.\"\nElend nodded.\n\"I thought a siege was a good idea,\" Cett said. \"But, I don't think it will work anymore, son. The ash is\nfalling too hard now, and we don't have supplies. This whole thing is becoming a damn mess.

Shouting and\ncursing. It was faint—Cett probably couldn't hear it. Elend left, hurrying toward the sound, leaving Cett\nbehind.\nAnother fight, Elend realized as he approached one of the cooking fires. He heard yells, blustering,\nand the sounds of men brawling. Cett's right. Goodhearted or not, our men are getting too restless. I\nneed—\n\"Stop this immediately!\" a new voice called. Just ahead, through the dark mists, Elend could see\nfigures moving about the firelight. He recognized the voice; General Demoux had arrived on the scene.\nElend slowed. Better to let the general deal with the disturbance. There was a big difference between\nbeing disciplined by one's military commander and one's emperor. The men would be better off if\nDemoux were the one to punish them.\nThe fighting, however, did not stop.\n\"Stop this!\" Demoux yelled again, moving into the conflict. A few of the brawlers listened to him,\npulling back. The rest, however, just continued to fight. Demoux pushed himself into the melee, reaching\nto pull apart two of the combatants.\nAnd one of them punched him. Square in the face, throwing Demoux to the ground.\nElend cursed, dropping a coin and Pushing himself forward. He fell directly into the middle of the\nfirelight, Pushing out with a Soothing to dampen the emotions of those fighting.\n\"Stop!\" he bellowed.\nThey did, freezing, one of the soldiers standing over the fallen General Demoux.\n\"What is going on here?\" Elend demanded, furious. The soldiers looked down. \"Well?\" Elend said,\nturning toward the man who had punched Demoux.\n\"I'm sorry, my lord,\" the man grumbled. \"We just . . .\"\n\"Speak, soldier,\" Elend said, pointing, Soothing the man's emotions, leaving him compliant and docile.\n\"Well, my lord,\" the man said. \"They're cursed, you know.

Then, of course their leader would show, demanding that we stop. I just . . . well, I'm tired of\nlistening to them, is all.\"\nElend frowned in anger. As he did so, a group of the army's Mistings—Ham at their head—shoved\nthrough the crowd. Ham met Elend's eyes, and Elend nodded toward the men who had been fighting.\nHam made quick work of them, gathering them up for reprimand. Elend walked over, pulling Demoux to\nhis feet. The grizzled general looked more shocked than anything.\n\"I'm sorry, my lord,\" Demoux said quietly. \"I should have seen that coming . . .

Demoux, however, met his eyes. You know what needs to be\ndone, he seemed to say.\nBeing a king isn't always about doing what you want, Tindwyl had often said. It's about doing\nwhat needs to be done.\n\"Demoux,\" Elend said. \"I think the problems in Luthadel are even more serious than our difficulties with\ndiscipline. Penrod looked toward us for support.

Toward Fadrex City. \"Cett's right,\" he finally said. \"We\ncan't just continue to sit out here, not while the world is dying.\"\n\"So, what do we do about it?\" Ham asked.\nElend wavered. What to do about it indeed? Retreat and leave Vin—and probably the entire\nempire—to its doom? Attack, causing the deaths of thousands, becoming the conqueror he feared? Was\nthere no other way to take the city?\nElend turned and struck out into the night. He found his way to Noorden's tent, Ham following\ncuriously. The former obligator was awake, of course. Noorden kept odd hours. He stood hurriedly as\nElend entered his tent, bowing in respect.\nThere, on the table, Elend found what he wanted. The thing he had ordered Noorden to work on.\nMaps. Troop movements.\nThe locations of koloss bands.\nYomen refuses to be intimidated by my forces, Elend thought. Well, let's see if I can turn the odds\nback against him.\nOnce \"freed,\" Ruin was able to affect the world more directly. The most obvious way he did this\nwas by making the ashmounts emit more ash and the earth begin to break apart. As a matter of\nfact, I believe that much of Ruin's energy during those last days was dedicated to these tasks.\nHe was also able to affect and control far more people than before. Where he had once\ninfluenced only a few select individuals, he could now direct entire koloss armies.\n48\nAS DAYS PASSED IN THE CAVERN, Vin regretted knocking over the lantern. She tried to salvage\nit, searching with blind fingers. However, the oil had spilled. She was locked in darkness.\nWith a thing that wanted to destroy the world.\nSometimes she could sense it, pulsing near her, watching silently—like some fascinated patron at a\ncarnival show. Other times, it vanished. Obviously, walls meant nothing to it. The first time it disappeared,\nshe felt a sense of relief. However, just moments after it vanished, she heard Reen's voice in her mind. I\nhaven't left you, it said. I'm always here.\nThe words chilled her, and she thought—just briefly—that it had read her mind. However, she\ndecided that her thoughts would have been easy to guess. Looking back through her life, she realized that\nRuin couldn't have spoken each and every time she heard Reen's voice in her head. A lot of the time she\nheard Reen, it was in response to things she'd been thinking, rather than things she'd been doing. Since\nRuin couldn't read minds, those comments couldn't have come from it.\nRuin had been speaking to her for so long, it was difficult to separate her own memories from its\ninfluence. Yet, she had to trust in the Lord Ruler's promise that Ruin couldn't read her mind. The\nalternative was to abandon hope. And she wouldn't do that. Each time Ruin spoke to her, it gave her\nclues about its nature. Those clues might give her the means to defeat it.\nDefeat it? Vin thought, leaning back against a rough stone wall of the cavern. It's a force of nature,"

It's a force of nature,\nnot a man. How could I even think to defeat something like that?\nTime was very difficult to gauge in the perpetual blackness, but she figured from her sleep patterns that\nit had been around three or four days since her imprisonment.\nEveryone called the Lord Ruler a god, Vin reminded herself. I killed him.\nRuin had been imprisoned once. That meant that it could be defeated, or at least bottled up. But, what\ndid it mean to imprison an abstraction—a force—like Ruin? It had been able to speak to her while\nimprisoned. But its words had felt less forceful then. Less . . . directed. Ruin had acted more as an\ninfluence, giving the child Vin impressions that manifested through memories of Reen. Almost like . . . it\nhad influenced her emotions. Did that mean it used Allomancy? It did indeed pulse with Allomantic\npower.\nZane heard voices, Vin realized. Right before he died, he seemed to be talking to something. She\nfelt a chill as she rested her head back against the wall.\nZane had been mad. Perhaps there was no connection between the voices he heard and Ruin. Yet, it\nseemed like too much of a coincidence. Zane had tried to get her to go with him, to seek out the source\nof the pulsings—the pulsings that had eventually led her to free Ruin.\nSo, Vin thought, Ruin can influence me regardless of distance or containment. However, now\nthat it has been freed, it can manifest directly. That brings up another question. Why hasn't it\nalready destroyed us all? Why play games with armies?\nThe answer to that one, at least, seemed obvious. She sensed Ruin's boundless will to destroy. She felt\nas if she knew its mind. One drive. One impulse. Ruin. So, if it hadn't accomplished its goal yet, that\nmeant it couldn't. That it was hindered. Limited to indirect, gradual means of destruction—like falling ash\nand the light-stealing mists.\nStill, those methods would eventually be effective. Unless Ruin was stopped. But how?\nIt was imprisoned before . . . but what did the imprisoning? She'd once assumed that the Lord\nRuler had been the one behind Ruin's imprisonment. But that was wrong. Ruin had already been\nimprisoned when the Lord Ruler had traveled to the Well of Ascension. The Lord Ruler, then known as\nRashek, had gone on the quest with Alendi, in order to slay the presumed Hero of Ages. Rashek's\npurpose had been to stop Alendi from doing what Vin had eventually done: accidentally releasing Ruin.\nIronically, it had been better that a selfish man like Rashek had taken the power. For, a selfish man\nkept the power for himself, rather than giving it up and freeing Ruin.\nRegardless, Ruin had already been imprisoned before the quest began. That meant that the\nDeepness—the mists—weren't related to Ruin. Or, at least, the connection wasn't as simple as she'd\nassumed.

In fact, the daymists had started to appear as much as a year before she'd released Ruin,\nand the mists had started killing people some hours before Vin had found her way to the Well.\nSo . . . what do I know? That Ruin was imprisoned long ago. Imprisoned by something that,\nperhaps, I can find and use again?\nShe stood up. Too much sitting and thinking had made her restless, and she began to walk, feeling her\nway along the wall.\nDuring her first day of imprisonment she'd begun, by touch, to scout the cavern. It was huge, like the\nother caches, and the process had taken her several days. However, she'd had nothing else to do. Unlike\nthe cache in Urteau, this one had no pool or source of water. And, as Vin investigated it, she discovered\nthat Yomen had removed all of the water barrels from what she assumed was their place on the far right\ncorner. He'd left the canned food and other supplies—the cavern was so enormous that he would have\nhad trouble finding time to remove everything, let alone finding a place to store it somewhere\nelse—however, he'd taken all of the water.\nThat left Vin with a problem. She felt her way along the wall, locating a shelf where she'd left an open\ncan of stew. Even with pewter and a rock, it had taken her a frightfully long time to get into the can.\nYomen had been clever enough to remove the tools she could have used for opening the food stores, and\nVin only had one vial's worth of pewter remaining. She'd opened some ten cans of food on her first day,\nburning away what pewter she'd had inside of her. That food was already dwindling, however, and she\nwas feeling the need for water—the stew did little to quench her thirst.\nShe picked up the can of stew, carefully eating only a mouthful. It was almost gone. The taste\nreminded her of the hunger that was a growing complement to her thirst. She pushed the feeling away.\nShe'd dealt with hunger for her entire childhood. It was nothing new, even if it had been years since she'd\nlast felt it.\nShe moved on, trailing fingers on the side of the wall to keep her bearings. It seemed like such a clever\nway to kill a Mistborn. Yomen couldn't defeat her, and he trapped her instead. Now, he could simply\nwait for her to die of dehydration. Simple, effective.\nPerhaps Ruin is speaking to Yomen, too, she thought. My imprisonment could all be part of\nRuin's plan.\nWhatever that is.\nWhy had Ruin chosen her? Why not lead someone else to the Well of Ascension? Someone easier to\ncontrol? She could understand why Ruin had chosen Alendi, all those years before. During Alendi's time,\nthe Well had been sequestered high in the mountains. It would have been a very difficult trek, and Ruin\nwould have needed just the right person to plan, then survive, the expedition.\nHowever, during Vin's day, the Well had somehow been moved to Luthadel. Or, perhaps Luthadel\nhad been built on top of the Well. Either way, it was there, right beneath the Lord Ruler's palace. Why"

And, of all the people he could have chosen as his pawn, why\nVin?\nShe shook her head as she arrived at her destination—the only other thing of interest in the vast\ncavern. A metal plate on the wall. She reached up, brushing her fingers across the slick steel. She'd never\nbeen an excellent reader, and the last year—spent in war and travel—hadn't afforded her much time to\nimprove her abilities. And so, it had taken her some time, feeling her way across each groove carved into\nthe metal, to figure out what was written on the plate.\nThere was no map. Or, at least, not like the ones in the previous storage caverns. Instead, there was a\nsimple circle, with a dot at the center. Vin wasn't certain what it was supposed to mean. The text was\nequally frustrating. Vin ran her fingers across the grooves, though she had long since memorized what the\nwords said.\nI have failed you.\nI have planned these caverns, knowing a calamity is coming, hoping that I might find some\nsecret that might be of use should I fall to the thing's scheming. Yet, I have nothing. I do not know\nhow to defeat it. The only thing I can think of is to keep it at bay by taking the power at the Well\nfor myself when it returns.\nHowever, if you are reading this, I have failed. That means I am dead. As I write this, I find that\nprospect to be less tragic than I might previously have assumed. I would rather not deal with the\nthing. It has been my constant companion, the voice that whispers to me always, telling me to\ndestroy, begging me to give it freedom.\nI fear that it has corrupted my thoughts. It cannot sense what I think, but it can speak inside of\nmy head. Eight hundred years of this has made it difficult to trust my own mind. Sometimes, I\nhear the voices, and simply assume that I am mad.\nThat would certainly be preferable.\nI do know that these words must be written in steel to be preserved. I have written them in a\nsteel sheet, then ordered them scribed into a plate, knowing that in doing so, I reveal my weakness\nto my own priests. The thing has whispered to me that I am a fool to expose myself by writing this\nand letting others see it.\nThat is primarily why I decided to go through with the creation of this plate. Doing so seemed\nto make the thing angry. That is reason enough, I think. It is good that some few of my loyal\npriests know of my weakness, if only for the good of the empire, should I somehow fall.\nI have tried to be a good ruler. At first, I was too young, too angry. I made mistakes. Yet, I have\ntried so hard. I nearly destroyed the world with my arrogance, and yet I fear I have nearly\ndestroyed it again through my rule. I can do better. I will do better. I will create a land of order.\nThe thoughts in my mind, however, make me wonder just how much of what I do has been\ntwisted from my original intentions.

Yet, if\nthat is so, why can I not stop the rebellions? They cannot defeat me, and I must order them\nslaughtered each time they rise up. Can they not see the perfection of my system?\nRegardless, this is not the place for justification. I need no justification, for I am—after a\nform—God. Yet, I know there is something greater than I. If I can be destroyed, It will be the\ncause of that destruction.\nI have no advice to give. It is more powerful than I am. It is more powerful than this world. It\nclaims to have created this world, in fact. It will destroy us all eventually.\nPerhaps these stores will let mankind survive a little longer. Perhaps not. I am dead. I doubt\nthat I should care.\nStill, I do. For you are my people. I am the Hero of Ages. That is what it must mean: Hero of\nAges, a hero that lives through the ages, as I do.\nKnow that the thing's power is not complete. Fortunately, I have hidden his body well.\nAnd that was the end. Vin tapped the plate with frustration. Everything about the words on it seemed\ncontrived to frustrate her. The Lord Ruler had led them on this grand chase, then at the end, he offered\nno hope? Elend was betting so much on what this plaque would contain, and yet, it was virtually\nworthless. At least the other ones had contained some relevant information about a new metal or the like.\nI have failed you. It was infuriating—almost crushingly so—to come all this way, then find that the\nLord Ruler had been as stumped as they were. And, if he'd known more—as his words implied that he\ndid—why hadn't he shared it on the plate? And yet, she could sense his instability even through these\nwords—his washing back and forth from contrition to arrogance. Perhaps that was Ruin's influence on\nhim. Or, perhaps it was simply the way he had always been. Either way, Vin suspected that the Lord\nRuler couldn't have told her much more that would have been of use. He'd done what he could, holding\nRuin at bay for a thousand years. It had corrupted him, perhaps even driven him mad.\nThat didn't stop her from feeling a sharp sense of disappointment at what the plate contained. The\nLord Ruler had been given a thousand years to worry about what would happen to the land if he were\nkilled before the power returned to the Well, and even he hadn't been able to come up with a way out of\nthe problem.\nShe looked up toward the plate, though in the darkness, she could not see it.\nThere has to be a way! she thought, refusing to accept the Lord Ruler's implication that they were\ndoomed. What was it you wrote at the bottom? \"I have hidden his body well.\"\nThat part seemed important. However, she hadn't been—\nA sound rung through the darkness.\nVin turned immediately, growing tense, feeling for her last metal vial. Proximity to Ruin had made her\njumpy, and she found her heart beating with anxiety as she listened to the echoing sounds—sounds of\nstone grinding against stone."

The answer\nto this is simple enough, if one understands the workings of power.\nBefore the Lord Ruler's death, he maintained too tight a grip on them to let Ruin control them\ndirectly. Even after the Lord Ruler's death, however, such a servant of Ruin could never have\nrescued him. The power in the Well was of Preservation, and an Inquisitor could only have taken\nit by first removing his Hemalurgic spikes. That, of course, would have killed him.\nThus, Ruin needed a much more indirect way to achieve his purpose. He needed someone he\nhadn't tainted too much, but someone he could lead by the nose, carefully manipulating.\n49\nSAZED MADE A SMALL NOTATION ON HIS DIAGRAM, comparing measurements of the\nwaterway. From what he could tell, the Lord Ruler hadn't really needed to do much to create the\nunderground lake. Water had already been flowing into the cavern. The Lord Ruler's engineers had\nsimply widened the passageways, bringing in a steadier, surer flow that outpaced the natural drainage.\nThe result was an aquifer of good size. Some machinery in a side cave proved to be a mechanism for\nplugging the outlets at the bottom—presumably so that one could keep the water reserve from escaping,\nshould something happen to the incoming supply. Unfortunately, there was no existing way to block off\nthe inlets.\nBefore the Lord Ruler's creation of the reservoir, only a small amount of the water had passed into the\ncavern. The rest flowed instead into what were now the streets, filling the canals. So, Sazed assumed, if\nhe could stop the water from entering the cavern, it would refill the canals.\nI'll need to know more about water pressure, Sazed thought, so I can provide enough weight to\nplug those inlets. He thought he'd seen a book on the subject inside his metalmind.\nHe leaned back in his chair, tapping his metalmind. Memory blossomed inside his head as he withdrew\na section of text: an index he'd made listing the titles of books he had in his storage. As soon as he pulled\nthe text out, the words became as clear to him as if he'd just read and memorized them. He scanned\nthrough the list quickly, seeking the title he needed. When he found it, he scribbled it on a piece of paper.\nThen, he placed the list back inside his coppermind.\nThe experience was odd. After replacing the list, he could recollect having drawn the material\nout—but, he had no memory whatsoever of what the index had contained. There was a blank in his\nmind. Only the words scribbled on the paper explained things that he'd known just seconds before. With\nthat title, he could draw the appropriate book into his mind in its entirety. He selected the chapters he\nwanted, then stuck the rest back into the coppermind, lest they decay.\nAnd, with those chapters, his knowledge of engineering was as fresh as if he'd just read and studied\nthe book.

Even with the\nknowledge provided by his copperminds, it was difficult work, with many calculations—not exactly the\nkind of research he was accustomed to. Fortunately, a Keeper's copperminds were not limited to his\nown interests. Each Keeper kept all of the knowledge. Sazed could vaguely remember the years he'd\nspent listening and memorizing. He'd only needed to know the information well enough to remember it for\na short time, then he could dump it into a coppermind. In that way, he was both one of the smartest and\nmost ignorant men who had ever lived—he had memorized so much, but had intentionally forgotten it all.\nRegardless, he had access to texts on engineering as well as religion. Knowing such things did not\nmake him a brilliant mathematician or architect—however, it did give him enough competence to make\nhim a good deal better than a layman.\nAnd, as he worked, he was finding it more and more difficult to deny that scholarship was something\nat which he excelled. He was not a leader. He was not an ambassador. Even while he served as Elend's\nchief ambassador, he'd spent much of his time looking through his religions. Now, when he should be\nheading the team in Urteau, more and more he found himself letting Spook take the lead.\nSazed was a man of research and of letters. He found contentment in his studies. Even though\nengineering wasn't an area he particularly enjoyed, the truth was, he'd much rather study—no matter\nwhat the topic—than do anything else. Is it such a shameful thing, he thought, to be the man who\nlikes to provide information for others, rather than be the one who has to use that information?\nThe tapping of a cane on the ground announced Breeze's arrival. The Soother didn't need a cane to\nwalk; he just preferred to carry one to look more gentlemanly. Of all the skaa thieves Sazed had known,\nBreeze did by far the best job of imitating a nobleman.\nSazed quickly jotted down a few more notations, then returned the chapters on water pressure to his\ncoppermind. No need to let them decay while speaking to Breeze. For, of course, Breeze would want to\ntalk. Sure enough, as soon as Breeze sat at Sazed's table, he scanned the diagrams, then raised an\neyebrow. \"That's coming along nicely, my dear man. You may have missed your calling.\"\nSazed smiled. \"You are kind, Lord Breeze, though I fear an engineer would find this plan unsightly.\nStill, I think it will be sufficient.\"\n\"You really think you can do it?\" Breeze asked. \"Make the waters flow as the lad asked? Is it even\npossible?\"\n\"Oh, it is quite possible,\" Sazed said. \"My expertise—not the plausibility of the task—is the item in\nquestion.

Canal works generally don't have much of a current, especially in an area where there are\nmany locks.\"\nBreeze raised an eyebrow.\n\"Actually,\" Sazed continued, \"canals are far more fascinating than you might expect. Take, for instance,\nthe methods of transforming a natural river into a canal—making it what is called a navigation—or\nperhaps look at the methods of dredging used to remove silt and ash from the depths. I have one\nparticular book by the infamous Lord Fedre, who—despite his reputation—was an absolute genius when\nit came to canal architecture.

It's good to see you excited about your\nstudies again. I don't know what it was you were working on before, but it always bothered me that you\nwouldn't share it with anyone. Seemed like you were almost ashamed of what you were doing. Now,\nhowever—this is like the Sazed I remember!\"\nSazed looked down at his scribbled notes and diagrams. It was true. The last time that he had been so\nexcited about a line of study was . . .\nWhen he'd been with her. Working on their collection of myths and references regarding the Hero of\nAges.\n\"In truth, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said, \"I do feel somewhat guilty.\"\nBreeze rolled his eyes. \"Sazed. Do you always have to be feeling guilty about something? Back in the\noriginal crew, you felt you weren't doing enough to help us overthrow the Lord Ruler. Then, once we\nkilled him, you were distraught because you weren't doing what the other Keepers told you to. Do you\nwant to tell me exactly how you go about feeling guilty for studying, of all things?\"\n\"I enjoy it.\"\n\"That's wonderful, my dear man,\" Breeze said. \"Why be ashamed of that enjoyment? It's not like you\nenjoy killing puppies or something like that. True, I think you're a bit crazy, but if you want to enjoy\nsomething so particularly esoteric, then you should feel free. It leaves more room for those of us who\nprefer more common delights—such as getting drunk on Straff Venture's finest wines.\"\nSazed smiled. He knew that Breeze was Pushing on his emotions, making him feel better, but he did\nnot rebel against the emotions. The truth was, he did feel good. Better than he had in some time.\nThough, still . . .\n\"It is not so simple, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said, setting down his pen. \"I feel happy being able to simply\nsit and read, without having to be in charge.

Spook, just barely visible, stood at the edge, speaking with Goradel and some of the soldiers.\n\"And what of him, Lord Breeze?\" Sazed asked in a whisper, low enough that even Spook wouldn't be\nable to hear. \"As I said, Emperor Venture placed me in charge of this matter. What if I let Spook take\ncontrol, and then he fails? I worry that the young man is not . . . seasoned enough for this task.\"\nBreeze shrugged. \"He seems to be doing well so far. Remember how young Vin was when she killed\nthe Lord Ruler.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed whispered, \"but this situation is different. Spook seems . . . odd, lately. He is certainly\nhiding things from us. Why is he so determined to take this city?\"\n\"I think it's good for the boy to show a little determination,\" Breeze said, sitting back in his chair. \"That\nlad has been far too passive for most of his life.\"\n\"Do you not worry about his plan? This could easily collapse around us.\"\n\"Sazed,\" Breeze said. \"Do you remember our meeting a few weeks back? Spook asked me why we\ncouldn't just topple Quellion like we did the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"I remember,\" Sazed said. \"You told him the reason we couldn't was because we didn't have Kelsier\nanymore.\"\nBreeze nodded. \"Well,\" he said softly, pointing his cane toward Spook, \"my opinion has been revised.\nWe don't have Kelsier, but it's looking more and more like we have something similar.\"\nSazed frowned.\n\"I'm not saying the lad has Kelsier's force of personality. His . . . presence. However, you've heard the\nreputation the boy is gaining among the people. Kelsier succeeded not because of who he was, but\nbecause of who people thought he was. That's something I didn't believe we could replicate. I'm starting\nto think I was wrong.\"\nSazed wasn't as easily convinced. Yet, he kept his reservations to himself as he turned back to his\nresearch. Spook must have noticed them looking over at him, for a few minutes later he made his way to\nSazed's table. The boy blinked against the lantern-light, soft though it was, and pulled up a chair. The fine\nfurniture looked odd to Sazed, contrasted against the rows of dusty, utilitarian shelves.\nSpook looked fatigued. How long has it been since he slept? Sazed thought. He's still up whenever\nI bed down, and awake before I rise.\n\"Something doesn't feel right here,\" Spook said.\n\"Oh?\" Breeze asked. \"Other than the fact that we're chatting beside an underground lake in a\nstorehouse built by the Lord Ruler underneath an Inquisitor fortress?\"\nSpook gave the Soother a flat look, then glanced at Sazed. \"I feel like we should have been attacked\nby now.\"\n\"What makes you say that?\" Sazed asked."

The man's a bully after the classical style. He came to power through force,\nand he keeps control by giving the people plenty of alcohol and tiny freedoms, like letting them go to bars\nat night. At the same time, however, he keeps everyone on the edge of fear.\"\n\"How did he take charge, anyway?\" Breeze asked. \"How did he get control before some nobleman\nwith a good set of house guards could do it?\"\n\"Mists,\" Spook said. \"He went out in them, and declared that anyone faithful to the Survivor would be\nsafe in them. Then, the mists started killing, and gave a handy confirmation of what he'd said. He made a\nbig deal about the mists killing those who had evil in their hearts. The people were so worried about what\nwas happening that they listened to him. He managed to make a law that required everyone to go out in\nthe mists, so that they could see who died and who didn't. The ones who survived were—he\ndeclared—pure. He told them they could set up a nice little utopia. After that, they started killing\nnobility.\"\n\"Ah,\" Breeze said. \"Clever.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Spook said. \"He completely glossed over the fact that the nobility never got taken by the\nmists.\"\n\"Wait,\" Sazed said. \"What?\"\nSpook shrugged. \"Hard to confirm now, but that's what the stories say. The nobility seemed immune\nto the mistsickness. Not skaa who had noble blood, but actually nobility.\"\n\"How odd,\" Breeze noted.\nMore than odd, Sazed thought. Downright strange. Does Elend know about this connection? As\nSazed considered it, it seemed unlikely that Elend did. Their army and allies were all made up of skaa.\nThe only nobility they knew were those back in Luthadel, and they had all chosen to stay inside at night,\nrather than risk going into the mists.\n\"Either way,\" Spook said, \"Quellion's a bully. And bullies don't like anyone in their turf who can\nchallenge them. We should have had some kind of attempt on our lives by now.\"\n\"The lad has a point,\" Breeze said. \"Quellion's type doesn't kill just in fancy executions. I'd bet that for\nevery person he throws into one of those buildings, there are three dead in an alley somewhere, slowly\nbeing buried in ash.\"\n\"I've told Goradel and his men to be particularly careful,\" Spook said, \"and I've prowled our\nperimeter. However, I haven't caught any assassins so much as spying on us. Quellion's troops just sit out\nthere, watching us, but not doing anything.\"\nBreeze rubbed his chin. \"Perhaps Quellion is more afraid of us than you assume.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Spook said, sighing. He rubbed his forehead.\n\"Lord Spook,\" Sazed said carefully, \"you should sleep.\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Spook said.\nIf I didn't know better, I'd say he was burning pewter to stay awake, Sazed thought. Or, am I just"

Why should I be so suspicious of Spook? Is it simply because I know\nhim too well? Do I focus on my memories of the boy when he has obviously become a man?\n\"Anyway,\" Spook said, \"how goes the research?\"\n\"Rather well, actually,\" Sazed said, turning around several of his diagrams so that Spook could see\nthem. \"I am about ready to begin work on the actual construction.\"\n\"How long will it take, do you think?\"\n\"A few weeks, perhaps,\" Sazed said. \"A rather short time, all things considered. Fortunately, the\npeople who drained the canals left behind a large amount of rubble, which I can use. In addition, the\nLord Ruler stocked this storehouse quite well. There is timber, as well as some basic carpentry supplies,\nand even some pulley networks.\"\n\"What was that creature preparing for?\" Breeze said. \"Food and water, I can understand. But,\nblankets? Timber? Pulleys?\"\n\"Disaster, Lord Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"He included everything that a people would need in the event\nthat the city itself was destroyed. He even included bedrolls for sleeping and infirmary supplies. Perhaps\nhe feared koloss rampages.\"\n\"No,\" Spook said. \"He prepared for exactly what is happening. Now, you'll be building something to\nplug the water? I kind of thought you'd just collapse the tunnels.\"\n\"Oh, goodness no,\" Sazed said. \"We don't have the manpower or equipment to cause a cave-in. Also,\nI wouldn't want to do anything that would risk bringing the cavern down upon us. My plans are to build a\nwooden blocking mechanism that can be lowered into the current. Enough weight, along with the proper\nframework, should provide reinforcement to stop the flow. It's actually not unlike the mechanisms used in\nthe locks of canals.\"\n\"Which,\" Breeze added, \"he'll be happy to tell you about. At length.\"\nSazed smiled. \"I do think that—\"\nHe was cut off, however, as Captain Goradel arrived, looking a fair bit more solemn than usual.\n\"Lord Spook,\" Goradel said. \"Someone is waiting for you above.\"\n\"Who?\" Spook asked. \"Durn?\"\n\"No, my lord. She says she's the Citizen's sister.\"\n\"I'm not here to join with you,\" the woman—Beldre—said.\nThey sat in an austere audience chamber in the Inquisition building above their cavern. The room's\nchairs lacked any sort of cushioning, and steel plates hung on the wooden walls as decoration—to Sazed,\nthey were uncomfortable reminders of what he had seen when he had visited the Conventical of Seran.\nBeldre was a young woman with auburn hair. She wore a simple, Citizen-approved dress, dyed red.\nShe sat with hands in lap, and while she met the eyes of those in the room, there was a nervous\napprehension to her that weakened her position considerably."

How well did Spook\neven know how to fight?\n\"I'm here . . .\" Beldre said, looking down. \"I'm here because you're going to kill my brother.\"\n\"Now, where did you get an idea like that!\" Breeze said. \"We're in the city to forge a treaty with your\nbrother, not assassinate him! Do we look like the types who would be very good at that sort of thing?\"\nBeldre shot a glance at Spook.\n\"Him excluded,\" Breeze said. \"Spook is harmless.

You're making us\nboth seem like idiots. Beldre knows why we're here—everyone in the city knows why we're here.\"\nThe room fell silent.\nHe . . . looks a little bit like an Inquisitor, wearing those spectacles beneath the bandages, Sazed\nthought, shivering.\n\"Beldre,\" Spook said. \"You honestly expect us to think that you came here simply to plead for your\nbrother's life?\"\nShe glanced at Spook, defiantly meeting his eyes—or, rather, his lack thereof. \"You can try to sound\nharsh, but I know you won't hurt me. You're of the Survivor's crew.\"\nSpook folded his arms.\n\"Please,\" Beldre said. \"Quellion is a good man, like you. You have to give him more time. Don't kill\nhim.\"\n\"What makes you think we'd kill him, child?\" Sazed asked. \"You just said that you thought we would\nnever harm you.

Perhaps he knows someone else\nwho's claimed to have the Survivor's blessing, killing people in his name . . .\"\nBeldre blushed.\n\"Your brother doesn't trust us,\" Sazed said. \"Why do you?\"\nBeldre shrugged. \"I don't know,\" she said quietly. \"I guess . . . men who lie don't save children from\nburning buildings.\"\nSazed glanced at Spook, but couldn't read anything in the young man's hard expression.

Vin threw herself\nforward—Pushing off the coin—to shoot toward the front of the room. A crack of light outlined the\ndoor, and even this small amount of illumination hurt her eyes.\nShe gritted her teeth against the light, blinking as she landed. She threw herself up against the wall just\nto the side of the door, clutching her knives, flaring pewter to help herself deal with the sudden pain of\nlight. Tears crept down her cheeks.\nThe door stopped moving. A solitary man stepped into the cavern, bearing a raised lantern. He wore a\nfine black suit and gentleman's hat.\nVin ignored him.\nShe slipped around the man and ducked through the door, entering the small chamber beyond. A\ngroup of startled workers shied back, dropping ropes which were connected to the door's opening\nmechanisms. Vin ignored these men as well, other than to shove her way through them.

The wooden ladder's rungs became a blur beside her as she soared up and\nslammed into the trapdoor in the ceiling.\nAnd bounced off it with a grunt of pain.\nShe desperately caught rungs of the ladder as she began to fall, ignoring the sudden sting in her\nshoulder from hitting so hard.

The workers pulled back even further.\nThe nobleman smiled. \"Lady Venture, let me assure you of several things. The first is that you are the\nonly Allomancer among us, and so I have no doubt that you could slaughter us with the barest of efforts.\nThe second is that the stone above is not moving anytime soon, so we might as well sit down and have a\npleasant chat, as opposed to brandishing weapons and threatening each other.\"\nThere was something . . . disarming about the man.

If Yomen heard screams, he wouldn't be likely to open the trapdoor, and\nVin would have slaughtered innocents for no reason.\n\"So,\" Telden said, finishing off his wine. \"We are at a stalemate.

There has to be a way out—a chance to exploit this.\nHowever, it was incredibly unlikely that she'd be able to break through that door above. She could\nmaybe use duralumin and steel to Push her way through. However, her steel and pewter would be gone,\nand she was out of metal vials.\nTelden's words, unfortunately, held a great deal of truth. Even if Vin could survive in the cavern, she'd\nbe stagnant and useless. The siege would continue up above—she didn't even know how that was\ngoing—and the world would continue to die by Ruin's machinations.\nShe needed to get out of the cavern.

The wine would certainly\nhave been prepared with enough strength to knock out an Allomancer.\nHowever . . .\nPewter made the body resistant to all kinds of drugs. If she flared pewter with duralumin after drinking\nthe wine, would it perhaps burn away the poison and leave her awake? She could pretend to be\nunconscious, then escape above.\nIt seemed like a stretch. And yet, what was she to do? Her food was almost gone, and her chances\nfor escaping were slim. She didn't know what Yomen wanted of her—and Telden would be very unlikely\nto tell her—but he must not want her dead. If that had been the case, he'd simply have left her to starve.\nShe had a choice. Either wait longer in the cavern, or gamble on a better chance to escape up above."

Telden was chuckling. \"I'll be,\" he said to one of the servants.\n\"She actually went for it.\"\n\"You'd be dead if she hadn't, my lord,\" the servant said. \"We'd all be dead.\"\nAnd then the duralumin ran out. Her pewter disappeared with a puff, and with it went her immunity to\nthe drug, which hadn't burned away. It had been a long shot anyway.\nShe barely heard her weapon click as it slipped from her fingers and hit the floor. Then, she fell\nunconscious.\nOnce Ruin was free from his prison, he was able to influence people more strongly—but impaling\nsomeone with a Hemalurgic spike was difficult no matter what the circumstances.\nTo achieve such things, he apparently began with people who already had a tenuous grip on\nreality. Their insanity made them more open to his touch, and he could use them to spike more\nstable people. Either way, it's impressive how many important people Ruin managed to spike.\nKing Penrod, ruling Luthadel at the time, is a very good example of this.\n51\nELEND FLEW THROUGH THE MISTS. He'd never quite been able to manage Vin's horse shoe\ntrick. Somehow, she could keep herself in the air, bounding from Push to Push, then Pulling each\nhorseshoe back up behind her after she used it. To Elend, the process looked like a cyclone of\npotentially lethal chunks of metal with Vin at the center.\nHe dropped a coin, then Pushed himself in a powerful leap. He'd given up on the horseshoe method\nafter four or five failed attempts. Vin had seemed puzzled that he couldn't get it down—she'd apparently\nfigured it out on her own, needing only about a half hour's practice to perfect it.\nBut, well, that was Vin.\nElend made do with coins, of which he carried a rather large bag. Copper clips, the smallest of the old\nimperial coins, worked perfectly for his purposes—particularly since he was apparently much more\npowerful than other Mistborn. Each of his Pushes carried him farther than they should have, and he really\ndidn't use that many coins, even when traveling a long distance."

Each of his Pushes carried him farther than they should have, and he really\ndidn't use that many coins, even when traveling a long distance.\nIt felt good to be away. He felt free as he plunged down from his leap, dropping through the shifting\ndarkness, then flared pewter and landed with a muffled thump. The ground in this particular valley was\nrelatively free of ash—it had drifted, leaving a small corridor where it only came up to his mid-calf. So, he\nran for a few minutes, for the change.\nA mistcloak fluttered behind him. He wore dark clothing, rather than one of his white uniforms. It\nseemed appropriate; besides, he'd never really had a chance to be a true Mistborn. Since discovering his\npowers, he'd spent his life at war. There wasn't all that much need for him to go scuttling about in the\ndarkness, particularly not with Vin around to do it better.\nI can see why Vin would find this intoxicating, he thought, dropping another coin and bounding\nbetween two hilltops. Even with the stress of Vin's capture and the threat to the empire, there was an\nexhilarating freedom about cruising through the mists. It almost allowed him to forget about the wars, the\ndestruction, and the responsibility.\nThen, he landed, ash coming up to nearly his waist. He stood for a few moments, looking down at the\nsoft black powder. He couldn't escape it. Vin was in danger, the empire was collapsing, and his people\nwere starving. It was his job to fix these things—that was the burden he'd taken upon himself when he'd\nbecome emperor.\nHe Pushed himself into the air, leaving a trail of ash fluttering in the mists behind him.\nI certainly hope Sazed and Breeze are having better luck in Urteau, he thought. He was worried\nabout his chances with Fadrex, and the Central Dominance was going to need the grain in the Urteau\ncache if they were going to plant enough food for the coming winter.\nHe couldn't worry about that now. He simply had to count on his friends to be effective. Elend's job\nwas to do something to help Vin. He couldn't just sit and wait in the camp, letting Yomen pull the strings.\nAnd yet, he didn't dare try to assassinate Yomen—not after the man had tricked both of them so\ncleverly.\nAnd so, Elend ran, heading northeast, toward the last known location of a koloss army. The time for\nsubtlety and diplomacy was over. Elend needed a threat—something he could hold over Yomen's head\nand, if necessary, use to batter him. And nothing was better at battering a city than koloss. Perhaps he\nwas a fool for seeking out the brutes on his own. Perhaps it was wrong to give up on diplomacy. Yet, he\nhad made his decision. It seemed he had failed in so many things lately—protecting Vin, keeping\nLuthadel safe, defending his people—that he simply needed to act.\nAhead, he saw a light in the mists. He landed, running through a field of knee-deep ash. Only flared\npewter gave him the strength to manage it. When he got closer, he saw a village. He heard screams. He\nsaw shadows scrambling about in fright."

He\nsaw shadows scrambling about in fright.\nHe leaped, dropping a coin, flaring his metals. He passed through curling mist, looming over the village\nand its frightened occupants, his mistcloak flaring. Several of the homes were burning. And, by that light,\nhe could see the hulking dark forms of koloss moving through the streets. Elend picked a beast who was\nraising its weapon to strike, then Pulled. Below, he heard the koloss grunt, but it managed to hang onto\nits weapon. However, the koloss itself wasn't that much heavier than Elend—and so it was Pulled up into\nthe air by one arm as Elend was yanked downward. Elend Pulled himself against a door hinge as he fell,\nedging himself just to the side of the confused flying koloss. He sprayed the beast with coins as he\npassed.\nBeast and weapon spun in the air. Elend landed in the street before a huddled group of skaa. The\nflying koloss's weapon hit the ashen earth point-first beside him. The koloss itself dropped dead on the\nother side of the street.\nA large group of koloss turned, bloodred eyes shining in the firelight, frenzy making them excited about\nthe prospect of a challenge. He would have to frighten them first, before he'd be able to take control of\nthem. He was looking forward to that this time.\nHow could they possibly have once been people? Elend wondered, dashing forward and yanking\nthe fallen koloss sword from the ground as he passed it, throwing out a spray of black soil. The Lord\nRuler had created the creatures. Was this what had happened to those who had opposed him? Had they\nbecome koloss to make his army? The creatures had great strength and fortitude, and could subsist on\nthe barest of sustenance. Yet, to make men—even your enemies—into monsters such as this?\nElend ducked forward, dropping one beast by shearing its legs at the knees. Then he jumped, lopping\noff the arm of another. He spun, slamming his crude sword through the chest of a third. He felt no\nremorse at killing what had once been innocents. Those people were dead. The creatures that remained\nwould propagate themselves by using other humans unless they were stopped.\nOr unless they were controlled.\nElend cried out, spinning through the group of koloss, wielding a sword that should have been too\nheavy for him. More and more creatures took notice, turning to tromp down streets lit by the light of\nburning buildings. This was a very large group, by scout reports—some thirty thousand in number. That\nmany would quickly overrun such a small village, annihilating it like a small pile of ash before storm winds.\nElend would not let that happen. He fought, killing beast after beast. He'd come to gain himself a new\narmy, but as the time passed, he found himself fighting for another reason. How many villages such as this\none had been destroyed without anyone in Luthadel pausing to give so much as a passing thought? How\nmany subjects—claimed by Elend, even if they didn't know it—had he lost to the koloss? How many had\nhe failed to protect already?"

How many had\nhe failed to protect already?\nElend sheared a koloss head free, then spun, Pushing two smaller beasts away by their swords. A\nmassive twelve-footer was stomping forward, weapon raised. Elend gritted his teeth, then raised his own\nsword, flaring pewter.\nWeapon met weapon in the blazing village, metal ringing like a forge under the hammer. And Elend\nstood his ground, matching strength with a monster twice his height.\nThe koloss stood, dumbfounded.\nStronger than I should be, Elend thought, twisting and cutting the surprised creature's arm free. Why\ncan't that strength protect the people I rule?\nHe cried out, slicing the koloss clean through at the waist—if only to show that he could. The beast fell\ninto two gory pieces.\nWhy? Elend thought with rage. What strength must I possess, what must I do, to protect them?\nVin's words, spoken months ago back in the city of Vetitan, returned to him. She'd called everything\nhe did short-term. But, what more could he do? He was no slayer of gods, no divine hero of prophecy.\nHe was just a man.\nAnd, it seemed that these days, ordinary men—even Allomancers—weren't worth very much. He\nscreamed as he killed, ripping through another pack of koloss. And yet, like his efforts back at Fadrex, it\njust didn't seem like enough.\nAround him, the village still burned. As he fought, he could hear women crying, children screaming,\nmen dying. Even the efforts of a Mistborn were negligible. He could kill and kill, but that would not save\nthe people of the village. He screamed, Pushing out with a Soothing, yet the koloss resisted him. He\ndidn't bring even a single one under his control. Did that mean that an Inquisitor controlled them? Or\nwere they simply not frightened enough?\nHe fought on. And, as he did, the prevalence of death around him seemed a metaphor for all he had\ndone over the last three years. He should have been able to protect the people—he'd tried so hard to\nprotect the people. He'd stopped armies, overthrown tyrants, reworked laws, and scavenged supplies.\nAnd yet, all of that was a tiny drop of salvation in a vast ocean of death, chaos, and pain. He couldn't\nsave the empire by protecting a corner of it, just as he couldn't save the village by killing a small fraction\nof the koloss.\nWhat good was killing another monster if it was just replaced by two more? What good was food to\nfeed his people if the ash just smothered everything anyway? What good was he, an emperor who\ncouldn't even defend the people of a single village?\nElend had never lusted for power. He'd been a theorist and a scholar—ruling an empire had mostly\nbeen an academic exercise for him. Yet, as he fought on that dark night in the burning mists and falling\nash, he began to understand. As people died around him despite his most frenzied efforts, he could see\nwhat would drive men for more and more power.\nPower to protect. At that moment, he would have accepted the powers of god-hood, if it would mean"

At that moment, he would have accepted the powers of god-hood, if it would mean\nhaving the strength to save the people around him.\nHe dropped another koloss, then spun as he heard a scream. A young woman was being pulled from\na nearby house, despite an older man holding onto her arm, both yelling for help. Elend reached to his\nsash, pulling free his bag of coins. He tossed it into the air, then simultaneously Pushed on some of the\ncoins inside and Pulled on others. The sack exploded with twinkling bits of metal, and Elend shot some\nforward into the body of the koloss yanking on the woman.\nIt grunted, but did not stop. Coins rarely worked against koloss—you had to hit them just right to kill\nthem. Vin could do it.\nElend wasn't in a mood for such subtlety, even had he possessed it. He yelled in defiance, snapping\nmore coins at the beast. He flipped them up off the ground toward himself, then flung them forward,\nshooting missile after glittering missile into the creature's blue body. Its back became a glistening mass of\ntoo-red blood, and finally it slumped over.\nElend spun, turning from the relieved father and daughter to face down another koloss. It raised its\nweapon to strike, but Elend just screamed at it in anger.\nI should be able to protect them! he thought. He needed to take control of the entire group, not\nwaste time fighting them one at a time. But, they resisted his Allomancy, even as he Pushed on their\nemotions again. Where was the Inquisitor guardian?\nAs the koloss swung its weapon, Elend flared pewter and flung himself to the side, then sheared the\ncreature's hand free at the wrist. As the beast screamed in pain, Elend threw himself back into the fight.\nThe villagers began to rally around him. They obviously had no training for war—they were likely under\nYomen's protection and didn't need to worry about bandits or roving armies. Yet, despite their lack of\nskill, they obviously knew to stay close to the Mistborn. Their desperate, pleading eyes prodded Elend\non, drove him to cut down koloss after koloss.\nFor the moment, he didn't have to worry about the right or wrong of the situation. He could simply\nfight. The desire for battle burned within him like metal—the desire, even, to kill. And so he fought\non—fought for the surprise in the eyes of the townspeople, for the hope each of his blows seemed to\ninspire. They had given their lives up for lost, and then a man had dropped from the sky to defend them.\nTwo years before, during the siege of Luthadel, Vin had attacked Cett's fortification and slaughtered\nthree hundred of his soldiers. Elend had trusted that she had good reasons for the attack, but he'd never\nunderstood how she could do such a thing. At least, not until this night, fighting in an unnamed village, too\nmuch ash in the dark sky, the mists on fire, koloss dying in ranks before him.\nThe Inquisitor didn't appear.

The creatures surrounded him, and he burned duralumin, then\nburned zinc, and Pulled.\nThe village fell silent.\nElend paused, stumbling slightly as he finished his spin. He looked through the falling ash, turning\ntoward the remaining koloss—thousands and thousands of them—who now suddenly stood motionless\nand patient around him, under his control at last.\nThere's no way I took them all at once, he thought warily. What had happened to the Inquisitor?\nThere was usually one with a mob of koloss this big. Had it fled? That would explain why suddenly Elend\nhad been able to control the koloss.\nWorried, yet uncertain what else to do, he turned to scan the village. Some people had gathered to\nstare at him. They seemed to be in shock—instead of doing something about the burning buildings, they\nsimply stood in the mists, watching him.\nHe should have felt triumphant. And yet, his victory was spoiled by the Inquisitor's absence. In\naddition, the village was in flames—by this point, very few structures remained that weren't burning.\nElend hadn't saved the village. He'd found his koloss army, as he'd planned, but he felt as if he'd failed in\nsome greater way. He sighed, dropping his sword from tired, bloody fingers, then walked toward the\nvillagers. As he moved, he was disturbed by the number of koloss bodies he passed. Had he really slain\nso many?\nAnother part of him—quiescent now, but still aflame—was sorry that the time for killing had ended.\nHe stopped before a silent group of villagers.\n\"You're him, aren't you?\" an elderly man asked.\n\"Who?\" Elend asked.\n\"The Lord Ruler,\" the man whispered.\nElend looked down at his black uniform, encased in a mistcloak, both of which were slick with blood.\n\"Close enough,\" he said, turning to the east—toward where his human army camped many miles away,\nwaiting for him to return with a new koloss force to aid them. There was only one reason for him to do\nthat. Finally, he acknowledged what he'd decided, unconsciously, the moment he'd set out to find more\nof the creatures.\nThe time for killing hasn't ended at all, he thought. It has just begun.\nNear the end, the ash began to pile up in frightening amounts. I've spoken of the special microbes\nthat the Lord Ruler devised to help the world deal with the ashfalls. They did not \"feed\" on ash,\nreally. Rather, they broke it down as an aspect of their metabolic functions. Volcanic ash itself is,\nactually, good for soil, depending on what one wishes to grow.\nToo much of anything, however, is deadly. Water is necessary for survival, yet too much will\ndrown. During the history of the Final Empire, the land balanced on the very knife-edge of\ndisaster via the ash. The microbes broke it down about as rapidly as it fell, but when there was so\nmuch of it that it oversaturated the soil, it became more difficult for plants to survive."

The microbes broke it down about as rapidly as it fell, but when there was so\nmuch of it that it oversaturated the soil, it became more difficult for plants to survive.\nIn the end, the entire system fell apart. Ash fell so steadily that it smothered and killed, and the\nworld's plant life died off. The microbes had no chance of keeping up, for they needed time and\nnutrients to reproduce.\n52\nDURING THE DAYS OF THE LORD RULER, Luthadel had been the most crowded city in the\nworld. Filled with three- and four-story tenements, it had been packed with the skaa who'd worked its\nnumerous furnaces and forges, with the noble merchants who'd sold its goods, and with the high nobility\nwho'd simply wanted to be near the imperial court. TenSoon had assumed that now, with the Lord Ruler\ndead and the imperial government shattered, Luthadel would become far less densely populated.\nHe had, apparently, been wrong.\nStill wearing the wolfhound's body, he trotted along in amazement as he explored the streets. It\nseemed that every nook—every alleyway, every street corner, each and every tenement—had become\nhome to a skaa family. The city smelled terrible, and refuse clogged the streets, buried in ash.\nWhat is going on? he wondered. The skaa lived in filth, many of them looking sick, coughing\npiteously in their ash-filled gutters. TenSoon made his way toward Keep Venture. If there were answers\nto be found, he hoped to locate them there. Occasionally, he had to growl menacingly at skaa who\nlooked at him hungrily, and twice he had to run from gangs that ignored his growls.\nSurely Vin and Elend would not have let this city fall so far, he thought as he hid in an alley. It was\na foreboding sign. He'd left Luthadel without knowing whether or not his friends would even survive the\ncity's siege. Elend's banner—the spear and the scroll—flew at the front of the city, but could someone\nelse have taken Elend's sign as their own? And what of the koloss army that had threatened to destroy\nLuthadel a year ago?\nI should never have left her, TenSoon thought, feeling a stab of anxiety. My foolish kandra sense of\nduty. I should have stayed here, and told her what I know, little though it is.\nThe world could end because of my foolish honor.\nHe poked his head out of the alleyway, looking at Keep Venture. TenSoon's heart sank to see that its\nbeautiful stained-glass windows had been shattered. Crude boards blocked the broken holes. There\nwere guards at the front gates, however, which seemed a better sign.\nTenSoon crept forward, trying to look like a mangy stray. He kept to the shadows, edging his way up\nto the gate. Then, he lay down in some refuse to watch the soldiers. He expanded his eardrums, craning\nto hear what the men were saying.\nIt turned out to be nothing. The two guards stood quietly, looking bored and not a little disconsolate as\nthey leaned against their obsidian-tipped spears. TenSoon waited, wishing that Vin were there to Pull on\nthe emotions of the guards, making them more talkative."

TenSoon waited, wishing that Vin were there to Pull on\nthe emotions of the guards, making them more talkative.\nOf course, if Vin were here, I wouldn't have to be poking about for information, TenSoon\nthought with frustration. And so, he waited. Waited as the ash fell, waited even until the sky darkened\nand the mists came out. Their appearance finally sparked some life into the guards. \"I hate night duty,\"\none of them muttered.\n\"Nothing wrong with night,\" the other one said. \"Not for us. Mists didn't kill us. We're safe from them.\"\nWhat? TenSoon thought, frowning to himself.\n\"Are we safe from the king?\" the first guard said quietly.\nHis companion shot him a glance. \"Don't say such things.\"\nThe first guard shrugged. \"I just hope the emperor gets back soon.\"\n\"King Penrod has all of the emperor's authority,\" the second guard said sternly.\nAh, TenSoon thought. So Penrod managed to keep the throne. But . . . what's this about an\nemperor? TenSoon feared that the emperor was Straff Venture. That terrible man had been the one\npoised to take Luthadel when TenSoon had left.\nBut what of Vin? Somehow, TenSoon just couldn't bring himself to believe that she had been\ndefeated. He had watched her kill Zane Venture, a man who had been burning atium when Vin had none.\nShe'd done the impossible three times, to TenSoon's count. She'd slain the Lord Ruler. She'd defeated\nZane.\nAnd she'd befriended a kandra who had been determined to hate her.\nThe guards fell silent again. This is foolish, TenSoon thought. I don't have time to hide in corners\nand eavesdrop. The world is ending! He rose, shaking the ash from his body—an action that caused\nthe guards to start, raising their spears anxiously as they searched the darkening night for the source of\nthe sound.\nTenSoon hesitated, their nervousness giving him an idea. He turned and loped off into the night. He'd\ngrown to know the city quite well during his year serving with Vin—she had liked to patrol the city,\nparticularly the areas around Keep Venture. Even with his knowledge, however, it took TenSoon some\ntime to find his way to where he was going. He had never visited the location, but he had heard it\ndescribed.\nDescribed by a person whom TenSoon had been killing at the time.\nThe memory still brought him chills. Kandra served Contracts—and in Contracts, they usually were\nrequired to imitate specific individuals. A master would provide the proper body—kandra were\nforbidden to kill humans themselves—and the kandra would emulate it. However, before any of that\nhappened, the kandra would usually study its quarry, learning as much about them as possible.\nTenSoon had killed OreSeur, his generation brother. OreSeur, who had helped overthrow the Father.\nAt Kelsier's command, OreSeur had pretended to be a nobleman named Lord Renoux so that Kelsier\nwould have an apparent nobleman as a front to use in his plan to overthrow the empire. But, there had\nbeen a more important part for OreSeur to play in Kelsier's plot. A secret part that not even the other"

A secret part that not even the other\nmembers of the crew had known until after Kelsier's death.\nTenSoon arrived at the old warehouse. It stood where OreSeur had said it would. TenSoon\nshuddered, remembering OreSeur's screams. The kandra had died beneath TenSoon's torture, torture\nwhich had been necessary, for TenSoon had needed to learn all that he could. Every secret. All that he\nwould need in order to convincingly imitate his brother.\nThat day, TenSoon's hatred of humans—and at himself for serving them—had burned more deeply\nthan ever before. How Vin had overcome that, he still didn't know.\nThe warehouse before TenSoon was now a holy place, ornamented and maintained by the Church of\nthe Survivor. A plaque hung out front, displaying the sign of the spear—the weapon by which both\nKelsier and the Lord Ruler had died—and giving a written explanation of why the warehouse was\nimportant.\nTenSoon knew the story already. This was the place where the crew had found a stockpile of\nweapons, left by the Survivor to arm the skaa people for their revolution. It had been discovered the\nsame day that Kelsier had died, and rumors whispered that the spirit of the Survivor had appeared in this\nplace, giving guidance to his followers. Those rumors were true, after a fashion. TenSoon rounded the\nbuilding, following instructions OreSeur had given as he died. The Blessing of Presence let TenSoon\nrecall the precise words, and despite the ash, he found the spot—a place where the cobbles were\ndisturbed. Then, he began to dig.\nKelsier, the Survivor of Hathsin, had indeed appeared to his followers that night years ago. Or, at\nleast, his bones had. OreSeur had been commanded to take the Survivor's own body and digest it, then\nappear to the faithful skaa and give them encouragement. The legends of the Survivor, the whole religion\nthat had sprung up around him, had been started by a kandra.\nAnd TenSoon had eventually killed that kandra. But not before learning his secrets. Secrets such as\nwhere OreSeur had buried the bones of the Survivor, and how the man had looked.\nTenSoon smiled as he unearthed the first bone. They were years old now, and he hated using old\nbones. Plus, there would be no hair, so the one he created would be bald. Still, the opportunity was too\nvaluable to pass up. He'd only seen the Survivor once, but with his expertise in imitation . . .\nWell, it was worth a try.\nWellen leaned against his spear, watching those mists again. Rittle—his companion guard—said they\nweren't dangerous. But, Rittle hadn't seen what they could do. What they could reveal. Wellen figured\nthat he had survived because he respected them. That, and because he didn't think too hard about the\nthings he had seen.\n\"You think Skiff and Jaston will be late to relieve us again?\" Wellen asked, trying again to start a\nconversation.\nRittle just grunted. \"Dunno, Wells.\" Rittle never did care for small talk.\n\"I think maybe one of us should go see,\" Wellen said, eyeing the mist. \"You know, ask if they've come\nin yet. . . .\" He trailed off."

Penrod . . . he's given lots of strange orders, lately. Forcing the\nskaa to fight each other for food, claiming that only the strong should survive. He kills those who disagree\nwith him. That kind of thing.\"\n\"I see,\" the Survivor said.\nSurely he knows this already, Wellen thought. Why bother asking?\n\"Where is my Heir?\" the Survivor asked. \"The Hero of Ages, Vin.\"\n\"The Lady Empress?\" Wellen asked. \"She's with the emperor.\"\n\"Where?\""

My\nsergeant says that she and the emperor are fighting in the South, fighting koloss. But I've heard other men\nsay the army went to the west.\"\n\"That's not very helpful,\" Kelsier said.\nWellen perked up, remembering something.\n\"What?\" the Survivor asked, apparently noticing Wellen's change in posture.\n\"An army troop stopped by the city a few months ago,\" Wellen said, feeling proud. \"They kept it quiet,\nbut I was in the group that helped them resupply. Lord Breeze was with them, and he spoke of meeting\nup with others of your crew.\"\n\"Where?\" Kelsier asked. \"Where were they going?\"\n\"North,\" Wellen said. \"To Urteau. That must be where the emperor is, my lord. The Northern\nDominance is in rebellion. He must have taken his armies to quell it.\"\nThe Survivor nodded. \"Very well,\" he said. He turned as if to go, then paused, looking back. \"Pass\nwhat news you can,\" he said. \"There isn't much time left. Tell the people that when the mists leave, they\nshould immediately find shelter. A place underground, if possible.\"\nWellen paused, then nodded. \"The caverns,\" he said. \"Where you trained your army?\"\n\"That will do,\" Kelsier said. \"Farewell.\"\nThe Survivor disappeared into the mists.\nTenSoon left the gates of Keep Venture behind, running off into the mists. He could, perhaps, have\ngotten himself into the building. However, he wasn't certain how well his imitation of the Survivor would\nhold up under closer scrutiny.\nHe didn't know how reliable the two guards' information was. However, he had no better leads. Other\npeople he had talked to in the night hadn't been able to provide any information about the army's\nmovements. Evidently, Vin and Elend had been gone from Luthadel for quite some time.\nHe rushed back to the patch of earth behind the warehouse where he'd found Kelsier's body. He knelt\nin the darkness, uncovering the sack he'd stuffed with bones. He needed to get the dog's body back and\nhead north. Hopefully he would—\n\"You there!\" a voice said.\nTenSoon looked up reflexively. A man stood in the doorway of the warehouse, looking through the\nmists at TenSoon. A lantern flared to life behind him, revealing a group of people who had apparently\ntaken up residence inside of the holy place.\nUh, oh . . . TenSoon thought as those at the front adopted shocked expressions.\n\"My lord!\" the man in front said, quickly kneeling in his sleeping robe. \"You've returned!\"\nTenSoon stood, stepping carefully to hide the sack of bones behind him. \"I have,\" he said.\n\"We knew that you would,\" the man said as others began to whisper and cry out behind him. Many fell\nto their knees. \"We stayed in this place, praying for you to come give us counsel. The king is mad, my\nlord! What do we do?\""

What do we do?\"\nTenSoon was tempted to expose himself as a kandra, but looking into their hopeful eyes, he found that\nhe could not. Besides, perhaps he could do some good. \"Penrod has been corrupted by Ruin,\" he said.\n\"The thing that seeks to destroy the world. You must gather the faithful and escape this city before\nPenrod kills you all.\"\n\"My lord, where should we go?\"\nTenSoon hesitated. Where? \"There are a pair of guards at the front of Keep Venture. They know of a\nplace. Listen to them. You must get to a place underground. Do you understand?\"\n\"Yes, lord,\" the man said. Behind, more and more people were edging forward, straining to catch a\nglimpse of TenSoon. He bore their scrutiny with some nervousness. Finally, he bid them be careful, then\nfled into the night.\nHe found an empty building and quickly changed back to the dog's bones before anyone else could\nsee him. When he was done, he eyed the Survivor's bones, feeling a strange . . . reverence.\nDon't be silly, he told himself. They're just bones, like hundreds of other sets you've used. Still, it\nseemed foolish to leave such a potentially powerful tool behind. He carefully packed them into the sack\nhe'd pilfered, then—using paws he'd created to have more dexterity than those of a real wolfhound—he\ntied the sack on his back.\nAfter that, TenSoon left the city by the northern gate, running at full wolfhound speed. He would go to\nUrteau and hope that he was on the right path.\nThe pact between Preservation and Ruin is a thing of gods, and difficult to explain in human\nterms. Indeed, initially, there was a stalemate between them. On one hand, each knew that only by\nworking together could they create. On the other hand, both knew that they would never have\ncomplete satisfaction in what they created. Preservation would not be able to keep things perfect\nand unchanging, and Ruin would not be able to destroy completely.\nRuin, of course, eventually acquired the ability to end the world and gain the satisfaction he\nwanted. But, then, that wasn't originally part of the bargain.\n53\nSPOOK FOUND HER SITTING on the rocky lakeshore, looking out across the deep black waters,\nso still in the cavern's windless air. In the near distance, Spook could hear Sazed—with a large\ncontingent of Goradel's men—working on their project to stanch the flow of water into the cavern.\nSpook approached Beldre quietly, carrying a mug of warmed tea. It almost seemed to burn his flesh,\nwhich meant that it would be just right for normal people. He let his own food and drinks sit out until they\ncooled to room temperature.\nHe didn't wear his eye bandage. With pewter, he'd found that he could withstand a little lantern-light.\nShe didn't turn as he approached, so he cleared his throat. She jumped slightly.

It was no wonder that\nQuellion worked so hard to shelter the girl—one could not fake Beldre's level of innocence. She wouldn't\nsurvive three heartbeats in the underground. Even Allrianne, who did her best to look like a puff, had an\nedge to her that bespoke an ability to be as hard as necessary in order to survive. Beldre, though . . .\nShe's normal, Spook thought. This is how people would be, if they didn't have to deal with\nInquisitors, armies, and assassins. For that, he actually envied her. It was a strange feeling, after so\nmany years spent wishing that he were someone more important.\nShe turned back toward the waters, and he approached and sat beside her. \"Here,\" he said, handing\nher the mug. \"I know it gets a bit chilly down here, with the lake and the water.\"\nShe paused, then took the mug. \"Thank you,\" she whispered. Spook let her roam free in the\ncavern—there was very little she could sabotage, though he had warned Goradel's men to keep an eye\non her. Either way, there was no way she was going to get out. Spook kept two dozen men guarding the\nexit, and had ordered the ladder up to the trapdoor above removed, to be replaced only with proper\nauthorization.\n\"Hard to believe this place was beneath your city all along, isn't it?\" Spook said, trying to work into a\nconversation. Oddly, it had seemed easier to speak to her when he was confronting her in her gardens,\nsurrounded by danger.\nBeldre nodded. \"My brother would have loved to find this place. He worries about food supplies.\nFewer and fewer fish are being caught in the northern lakes. And crops . . . well, they're not doing so\nwell, I hear.\"\n\"The mists,\" Spook said. \"They don't let enough sunlight through for most plants.\"\nBeldre nodded, looking down at her mug. She hadn't taken a sip yet.\n\"Beldre,\" Spook said, \"I'm sorry. I actually considered kidnapping you from those gardens, but\ndecided against it. However, with you showing up here, alone . . .\"\n\"It was just too good an opportunity,\" she said bitterly. \"I understand. It's my own fault. My brother\nalways says I'm too trusting.\"\n\"There are times that would be an advantage.\"\nBeldre sniffed quietly. \"I've never known such times as that. It seems my entire life, I've just trusted\nand been hurt. This is no different.\"\nSpook sat, feeling frustrated with himself. Kelsier, tell me what to say! he thought. Yet, God\nremained silent. The Survivor didn't seem to have much advice about things that didn't relate to securing\nthe city.\nIt had all seemed so simple when Spook had given the order to capture her. Why, now, was he sitting\nhere with this empty pit in his stomach?\n\"I believed in him, you know,\" Beldre said.\n\"Your brother?\"\n\"No,\" she said with a slight shake of her head. \"The Lord Ruler.

He likes to make people do things without them knowing it.\nHalf the time, I'm certain that the things I'm saying are just ideas he somehow got into my head.\"\nBeldre shook her head. \"The Terrisman is in charge?

He's better off studying a project and writing notes than he is giving\ncommands. So, that only leaves me. I'm just doing the job that everyone else is too busy to do.\"\nBeldre sat quietly for a moment, then finally took a sip of her tea. \"Ah,\" she said. \"It's good!\"\n\"The Lord Ruler's own brew, for all we know,\" Spook said. \"We found it down here, with the rest of\nthis stuff.\"\n\"This is why you came, isn't it?\" Beldre asked, nodding to the cavern. \"I wondered why your emperor\ncared about Urteau. We haven't really been an important force in the world since the Venture line moved\nits center of power to Luthadel.\"\nSpook nodded. \"This is part of it, though Elend is also worried about the rebellion up here.

Most of the time, I feel like I'm still just\na bystander in all of this. Vin and Elend, they're the ones who really know what's going on.

He only dresses with any sense of fashion because a\nTerriswoman bought him a new wardrobe. War has changed him some, but on the inside, I think he's still\njust a dreamer caught in a world with too much violence.\n\"And Vin . . . well, she really is different. I've never been sure what to make of her. Sometimes, she\nseems as frail as a child. And then she kills an Inquisitor. She can be fascinating and frightening at the\nsame time.

I heard that's how you do it in noble society.\"\n\"Only if you're a romantic,\" Beldre said, smiling wistfully.\n\"Well, I gave her one,\" Spook said. \"But I don't think she knew what I meant by it.

If she'd been Vin, she would have stabbed him in the\nback at the first opportunity, and that would have probably been the right thing to do. Yet, this girl just\ncontinued to trust. It was like finding a beautiful plant growing alone in a field of burnt ash.\n\"Once we're done, maybe you could introduce me to the emperor and empress,\" Beldre said. \"They\nsound like interesting people.\"\n\"I'll never argue with that statement,\" Spook said. \"Elend and Vin . . . well, they're certainly interesting\n. Interesting people with heavy burdens. Sometimes, I wish I were powerful enough to do important\nworks like them.\"\nBeldre laid a hand on his arm, and he glanced down, a bit surprised. What?\n\"Power can be a terrible thing, Spook,\" she said quietly. \"I'm . . . not pleased with what it's done to my\nbrother. Don't wish so hard for it.\"\nSpook met her eyes, then nodded and rose. \"If you need anything, ask Sazed. He'll see to your\ncomforts.\"\nShe looked up. \"Where are you going?\"\n\"To be seen.\"\n\"I want primary trade contracts on all the canals,\" Durn said. \"And a title from the emperor.\"\n\"You?\" Spook said. \"A title? You think a 'lord' in front of your name is going to make that face any\nless ugly?\"\nDurn raised an eyebrow.\nSpook just chuckled. \"Both are yours. I cleared it with Sazed and Breeze—they'll even draft you a\ncontract, if you want.\"\nDurn nodded appreciatively. \"I do. Lords pay attention to things like that.\" They sat in one of his many\nbackroom chambers—not in his private home, but in a place attached to a particular inn. An old set of\ndrums hung on the wall.\nSpook had had little trouble sneaking out past Quellion's soldiers standing watch at the front of the\nMinistry building. Even before he'd gained enhanced abilities with tin, and long before he'd been able to\nburn pewter, he'd learned to sneak about in the night and spy. A group of soldiers had barely posed an\nobstacle for him. He couldn't remain cooped up in the cavern like the others. He had too much work to\ndo.\n\"I want the Harrows dammed off,\" Spook said. \"We'll flood the canals during the evening, when the\nmarkets are empty. Nobody lives in the streetslots except for those of you here in the slums. If you want\nto keep this place from flooding, you'll need a good watertight blockade in place.\"\n\"Already taken care of,\" Durn said. \"When the Harrows were new, we pulled off the lock system from\nits mouth, but I know where it is.

As always, Spook wore his burned cloak—it\nhad become something of a symbol for him. He'd never worn a mistcloak, but somehow, this felt even\nbetter.\nThe people rose when he entered. He smiled, motioning for Durn's men to bring out wineskins—stolen\nfrom the storage cavern and carried by Spook as he snuck out several nights in a row. \"Tonight,\" he said,\n\"you don't have to pay for Quellion's stolen liquor. That's his way of keeping you happy and content.\"\nAnd that was the only speech he gave. He wasn't Kelsier, able to impress people with his words.\nInstead—at Breeze's suggestion—he stayed mostly quiet. He visited tables, trying to not be aloof, but\nalso speaking little. He looked thoughtful, and asked the people about their problems. He listened to\nstories of loss and hardship, and drank with them to the memory of those Quellion had murdered. And,\nwith his pewter, he never got drunk. He already had a reputation for that—the people regarded it\nmystically, as they did his ability to survive fire.\nAfter that bar, they visited another, and another after that, Durn careful to keep him to the safest—and\nyet most populated—of the locations. Some were in the Harrows, others were above. Through it all,\nSpook felt an amazing thing: his confidence growing. He really was a little like Kelsier. Vin might have\nbeen the one trained by the Survivor, but Spook was the one who was doing just what he'd\ndone—encouraging the people, leading them to rise up for their own sakes.\nAs the evening passed, the various bars became a blur. Spook breathed curses against Quellion,\nspeaking of the murders and of the Allomancers the Citizen retained. Spook didn't spread the rumors that\nQuellion was himself an Allomancer—he let Breeze do that more carefully. That way, it wouldn't look\nlike Spook was too eager to set the man up.\n\"To the Survivor!\"\nSpook looked up, holding his mug of wine, smiling as the bar patrons cheered.\n\"To the Survivor!\" another said, pointing at Spook. \"Survivor of the Flames!\"\n\"To the death of the Citizen!\" Durn said, raising his own mug—though he rarely drank from it. \"Down\nwith the man who said he'd let us rule, then took it all for himself!\"\nSpook smiled, taking a drink. He hadn't realized how exhausting it could be to simply sit around and\nspeak to people. His flared pewter kept his body's weariness at bay, but it couldn't prevent the mental\nfatigue.\nI wonder what Beldre would think if she saw this, he thought. The men cheering me. She'd be\nimpressed, wouldn't she? She'd forget about how I droned on about how useless I was."

Yet, he couldn't help thinking back to their\nconversation, going over it again and again in his mind. Despite the stupid things he'd said, she'd laid her\nhand on his arm. That meant something, didn't it?\n\"You all right?\" Durn asked, leaning in. \"That's your tenth mug tonight.\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Spook said.\n\"You were looking a little distant there.\"\n\"I have a lot on my mind,\" Spook said.\nDurn leaned back, frowning, but didn't say anything more.\nSome things about his conversation with Beldre bothered Spook, even more than his own stupid\ncomments. She seemed to really be worried by the things that her brother had done. When Spook\nhimself was in power, would she see him as she did Quellion? Would that be a bad thing, or a good\nthing? She already said they were similar.\nPower can be a terrible thing. . . .\nHe looked up, glancing at the people of the bar as they cheered him again, just as the men had in the\nother bars. Kelsier had been able to handle adulation like this. If Spook wanted to be like Kelsier, then\nhe'd have to deal with it as well, right?\nWasn't it a good thing to be liked? To have people willing to follow him? He could finally break away\nfrom the old Spook. He could stop being that boy, the one so insignificant and easily forgotten. He could\nleave that child behind, and become a man who was respected. And why shouldn't he be respected? He\nwasn't that boy anymore. He wore his bandages across his eyes, heightening his mystical reputation as a\nman who did not need light to see. Some even said that anywhere that fire burned, Spook could see.\n\"They love you,\" Kelsier whispered. \"You deserve it.\"\nSpook smiled. That was all the confirmation he needed. He stood, raising his arms before the crowd.\nThey cheered in response.\nIt had been a long time coming. And it felt all the sweeter for the wait.\nPreservation's desire to create sentient life was what eventually broke the stalemate. In order to\ngive mankind awareness and independent thought, Preservation knew that he would have to give\nup part of himself—his own soul—to dwell within mankind. This would leave him just a tiny bit\nweaker than his opposite, Ruin.\nThat tiny bit seemed inconsequential, compared with their total vast sums of power. However,\nover aeons, this tiny flaw would allow Ruin to overcome Preservation, thereby bringing an end to\nthe world.\nThis, then, was their bargain.

Independent life that could think and feel.\nIn exchange, Ruin was given a promise—and proof—that he could bring an end to all they had\ncreated together. It was the pact.\nAnd Preservation eventually broke it.\n54\nWHEN VIN AWOKE, she was not surprised to find herself bound. She was surprised to feel that she\nwas wearing metal manacles.\nThe first thing she did—even before she opened her eyes—was reach inside for her metals. With steel\nand iron, perhaps she could use the manacles as weapons. With pewter . . .\nHer metals were gone.\nShe kept her eyes closed, trying not to display the panic she felt, thinking through what had happened.\nShe'd been in the cavern, trapped with Ruin. Elend's friend had come in, given her the wine, and she'd\ntaken it. Gambled.\nHow long had it been since she'd fallen unconscious?\n\"Your breathing has changed,\" a voice reported. \"You are obviously awake.\"\nVin cursed herself quietly. There was a very easy way to take away an Allomancer's powers—easier,\neven, than making them burn aluminum. You just had to keep them drugged long enough for them to pass\nthe metals through their body. As she thought about it, her mind shrugging off the effects of extended\nsleep, she realized this was what must have happened to her.\nThe silence continued. Finally, Vin opened her eyes. She expected to see cell bars. Instead, she saw a\nsparsely furnished, utilitarian room. She lay on a bench, head cushioned by a hard pillow. Her manacles\nwere connected to a chain several feet long, which was in turn locked to the base of the bench. She\ntugged on the chain carefully, and determined that it was very well affixed.\nThe motion drew the attention of a pair of guards who stood beside the bench. They jumped slightly,\nraising staffs and eyeing her warily. Vin smiled to herself; part of her was proud that she could evoke\nsuch a response even when chained and metalless.\n\"You, Lady Venture, present something of a problem.\" The voice came from the side. Vin raised\nherself up on one arm, looking over the bench's armrest. On the other side of the room—perhaps fifteen\nfeet away—a bald figure in robes stood with his back to her. He stared out a large window, facing west,\nand the setting sun was a violent crimson blaze around his silhouette.\n\"What do I do?\" Yomen asked, still not turning toward her. \"A single flake of steel, and you could\nslaughter my guards with their own buttons. A taste of pewter, and you could lift that bench and smash\nyour way out of the room. The logical thing to do would be to gag you, keep you drugged at all times, or\nkill you.\"\nVin opened her mouth to reply, but all that came out was a cough. She immediately tried to burn\npewter to strengthen her body. The lack of metal was like missing a limb. As she sat up, coughing further\nand growing dizzy, she found herself craving the metal more than she'd imagined that she ever would.\nAllomancy wasn't supposed to be addictive, not like certain herbs or poisons. However, at that moment,\nshe could have sworn that all the scientists and philosophers were flat-out wrong."

However, at that moment,\nshe could have sworn that all the scientists and philosophers were flat-out wrong.\nYomen made a sharp gesture with one arm, still not turning from the sunset. A servant approached,\nbearing a cup for Vin. She eyed it uncertainly.\n\"If I wanted to poison you, Lady Venture,\" Yomen said without turning, \"I could do it without guile.\"\nGood point, Vin thought wryly, accepting the cup and drinking the water it contained.\n\"Water,\" Yomen said. \"Collected from rain, then strained and purified. You will find no trace metals in\nit to burn. I specifically ordered it kept in wooden containers only.\"\nClever, Vin thought. Years before she'd become consciously aware of her Allomantic powers, she'd\nbeen burning the tiny bits of metal she haphazardly got from groundwater or dining utensils.\nThe water quenched her thirst and stilled her cough. \"So,\" she finally said, \"if you're so worried about\nme eating metals, why leave me ungagged?\"\nYomen stood quietly for a moment. Finally, he turned, and she could see the tattoos across his eyes\nand face, his skin reflecting the deep colors of the falling sun outside. On his forehead, he wore his single,\nsilvery bead of atium.\n\"Various reasons,\" said the obligator king.\nVin studied him, then raised the cup to take another drink. The motion jangled her manacles, which\nshe eyed in annoyance as they again restricted her movement.\n\"They're made of silver,\" Yomen said. \"A particularly frustrating metal for Mist-born, or so I am told.\"\nSilver. Useless, unburnable silver. Like lead, it was one of the metals that provided no Allomantic\npowers at all.\n\"An unpopular metal indeed . . .\" Yomen said, nodding to the side. A servant approached Vin, bearing\nsomething on a small platter. Her mother's earring. It was a dull thing, Allomantically, made of bronze\nwith some silver plating. Much of the gilding had worn off years ago, and the brownish bronze showed\nthrough, making the earring look to be the cheap bauble it was.\n\"Which is why,\" Yomen continued, \"I am so curious as to why you would bother with an ornament\nsuch as this. I have had it tested. Silver on the outside, bronze on the inside. Why those metals? One\nuseless to Allomancers, the other granting what is considered the weakest of Allomantic powers. Would\nnot an earring of steel or of pewter make more sense?\"\nVin eyed the earring. Her fingers itched to grab it, if only to feel metal between her fingers. If she'd had\nsteel, she could have Pushed on the earring, using it as a weapon. Kelsier had once told her to keep\nwearing it for that simple reason. Yet, it had been given to her by her mother. A woman Vin had never\nknown. A woman who had tried to kill her.\nVin snatched the earring. Yomen watched curiously as she stuck it in her ear. He seemed . . . wary.\nAs if waiting for something.\nIf I really did have some trick planned, she thought, he'd be dead in an instant. How can he stand"

Even if it isn't made of useful metals, I might find a\nway to use it against him.\nHer instincts told her he was trying an old street ploy—kind of like throwing your enemy a dagger to\nmake him attack. Yomen wanted to spring any traps she was planning. It seemed a silly move. How\ncould he possibly hope to best a Mistborn?\nUnless he himself is a Mistborn, Vin thought. He feels he can beat me.\nHe has atium, and is ready to burn it when I try something.\nVin did nothing; made no attack. She wasn't certain if her instincts about Yomen were right, but that\ndidn't really matter. She couldn't attack, for the earring had no hidden secret. The truth was, she simply\nwanted it back because it felt comfortable in her ear. She was accustomed to wearing it.\n\"Interesting,\" Yomen said. \"Regardless, you are about to discover one of the reasons I have left you\nwithout a gag . . .\" With that, he raised a hand toward the door. He clasped his hands behind his back as\na servant opened the door, showing in an unarmed soldier in the white and brown of Elend's livery.\nYou should kill him, Ruin whispered in her mind. All of them.\n\"Lady Venture,\" Yomen said without looking at her. \"I must ask you not to speak to this man except\nwhen I indicate, and answer only as I request. Otherwise, he will have to be executed, and a fresh\nmessenger sent for from your army.\"\nThe soldier paled. Vin just frowned, eyeing the obligator king. Yomen was obviously a calm man, and\nhe wanted to appear harsh. How much of it was an act?\n\"You can see that she is alive, as promised,\" Yomen said to the soldier.\n\"How do we know this is not a kandra in disguise?\" the soldier asked.\n\"You can ask your question,\" Yomen said.\n\"Lady Venture,\" the soldier said, \"what did you have for dinner the night before you went to the party\ninside the city?\"\nIt was a good question to ask. A kandra would have interrogated her about important moments—such\nas her first meeting with Elend. Something like a meal, however, was so random that no kandra would\nhave thought to ask about it. Now, if Vin could remember. . . .\nShe looked at Yomen. He nodded—she could answer. \"Eggs,\" she said. \"Fresh eggs that I bought in\nthe city, during one of my spying trips.\"\nThe man nodded.\n\"You have your answer, soldier,\" Yomen said. \"Report to your king that his wife is still alive.\"\nThe soldier withdrew and the servants closed the door. Vin sat back on the bench, waiting for a gag.\nYomen remained where he was, looking at her.\nVin looked back. Finally, she spoke. \"How long do you think that you can keep Elend placated? If\nyou know anything of him at all, then you will realize that he is a king first, and a man second. He will do\nwhat he needs to do, even if it means my death.\""

They say that you are a\nblunt woman, and appreciate brevity. Therefore, I will be straightforward with you. My purpose in\ncapturing you was not to use you as leverage against your husband.\"\n\"Is that so,\" she said flatly. \"Why did you capture me, then?\"\n\"It is simple, Lady Venture,\" Yomen said. \"I captured you so that I could execute you.\"\nIf he expected surprise from her, she didn't give it. She just shrugged. \"Sounds like an unnecessarily\nformal term. Why not just cut my throat while I was drugged?\"\n\"This city is a place of law,\" Yomen said. \"We do not kill indiscriminately.\"\n\"This is war,\" Vin said. \"If you wait for 'discrimination' before you kill, you'll have a lot of unhappy\nsoldiers.\"\n\"Your crime is not one of war, Lady Venture.\"\n\"Oh? And am I to know this crime, then?\"\n\"It is the most simple of all crimes. Murder.\"\nVin raised an eyebrow. Had she killed someone close to this man? Perhaps one of the noble soldiers\nin Cett's retinue, back a year ago when she'd assaulted Keep Hasting?\nYomen met her eyes, and she saw something in them. A loathing that he kept hidden behind the calm\nfront. No, she hadn't killed one of his friends or relatives. She'd killed someone far more important to\nhim.\n\"The Lord Ruler,\" she said.\nYomen turned away again.\n\"You can't honestly intend to try me for that,\" Vin said. \"It's ridiculous.\"\n\"There will be no trial,\" Yomen said. \"I am the authority in this city, and need no ceremony to give me\ndirection or permission.\"\nVin snorted. \"I thought you said this was a place of law.\"\n\"And I am that law,\" Yomen said calmly. \"I believe in letting a person speak for themselves before I\nmake my decision.

Your guards have\nbeen told to err on the side of safety, and they know that I will not punish them if they accidentally kill\nyou.\"\nVin paused, cup of water still held lightly in her fingers.\nKill him, Ruin's voice whispered. You could do it. Take a weapon from one of those soldiers, then\nuse it on Yomen.\nVin frowned. Ruin still used Reen's voice—it was familiar, something that had always seemed a part of\nher. Discovering that it belonged to that thing . . . it was like finding out that her reflection really belonged\nto someone else, and that she'd never actually seen herself.\nShe ignored the voice.

Yet, she couldn't fathom what it might be. Why leave her alive? He\nwas too clever a man to lack a reason.\nGiving no hint of his motivations, Yomen turned away from her again, looking back out his window.\n\"Take her away.\"\nBy sacrificing most of his consciousness, Preservation created Ruin's prison, breaking their deal\nand trying to keep Ruin from destroying what they had created. This event left their powers again\nnearly balanced—Ruin imprisoned, only a trace of himself capable of leaking out. Preservation\nreduced to a mere wisp of what he once was, barely capable of thought and action.\nThese two minds were, of course, independent of the raw force of their powers. Actually, I am\nuncertain of how thoughts and personalities came to be attached to the powers in the first\nplace—but I believe they were not there originally. For both powers could be detached from the\nminds that ruled them.\n55\nIT TOOK ELEND MUCH LONGER to get back from the village than it had taken to get there. For\none thing, he had left a lot of his coins with the villagers. He wasn't certain how much good money would\ndo them in the coming weeks, but he'd felt that he had to do something. They were going to have a rough\ntime of it the next few months. Their food stores nearly depleted, their homes burned by koloss, their\nwater sources contaminated by ash, their capital—and king—besieged by Elend himself . . .\nI have to stay focused, he told himself, walking through the falling ash. I can't help every village. I\nhave to worry about the larger picture.\nA picture that included using a force of koloss to destroy another man's city. Elend gritted his teeth,\ncontinuing to walk. The sun was creeping toward the horizon, and the mists had already started to\nappear, lit by the blazing fire of red sunlight. Behind him tromped some thirty thousand koloss. His new\narmy.\nThat was another reason it took him a bit longer to get back. He wanted to walk with the koloss army,\nrather than jumping ahead of them, in case their Inquisitor appeared to steal them back. He still couldn't\nbelieve that such a large group hadn't been under any kind of direction.\nI attacked a koloss army on my own, he thought as he slogged through a patch of thigh-deep ash. I\ndid it without Vin's help, intent on defeating their Inquisitor by myself.\nHow had he thought to fight an Inquisitor on his own? Kelsier himself had only barely been able to\ndefeat one of the things.\nVin has killed three now, he thought. We took them on together, but she was the one who killed\neach one.\nHe didn't begrudge her the abilities she had, but he did feel occasional glimmers of envy. That amused"

It had never bothered him when he'd been an ordinary man, but now that he was Mistborn too, he\nfound himself coveting her skill.\nAnd even with her skill, she had been captured. Elend tromped along, feeling a weight he couldn't\nshake. Everything just seemed wrong to him. Vin imprisoned, while he was free. Mist and ash suffocating\nthe land. Elend, despite all his powers, was unable to do anything to protect the people—and the\nwoman—he loved.\nAnd that was the third reason that he walked ploddingly with his koloss, rather than returning\nimmediately to his camp. He needed some time to think. Some time alone. Perhaps that was what had\ndriven him to leave in the first place.\nHe'd known that their work was dangerous, but he'd never really thought that he might lose her. She\nwas Vin. She always got out. She survived.\nBut what if, this time, she didn't?\nHe'd always been the vulnerable one—the common person in a world of Mist-born and koloss. The\nscholar who couldn't fight, who had to depend on Vin for protection. Even during the last year of fighting,\nshe'd stayed close to him. If she'd been in danger, he'd been in danger, and there hadn't really been time\nto think about what would happen if he survived and she didn't.\nHe shook his head, pushing through the ash. He could have used koloss to force a trail for him. For\nthe moment, however, he wanted to be apart even from them. So, he walked ahead, a lone figure in\nblack on a field of solid ash backlit by a setting red sun.\nThe ashfalls were getting far worse. Before he'd left the village, he'd spent a day having his koloss clear\nthe streets and rebuild some of the homes. Yet, with the rate at which the ash was falling, the mist and\neven the possibility of other wandering koloss were becoming secondary problems. The ash. It alone\nwould kill them. Already, it buried trees and hills. It was up to his waist in places.\nPerhaps if I'd stayed in Luthadel, he thought, working with my scholars, we could have\ndiscovered a way to stop this. . . .\nNo, that was foolish. What would they do? Plug the ashmounts? Find a way to wash all of the ash out\ninto the sea? In the distance ahead of him through the evening mists, he could see a red glow in the sky,\neven though the sun set on the opposite horizon. He could only assume that the light to the east came\nfrom fire and lava rising out of the ashmounts.\nWhat did he do about a dying sky, ash so thick he could barely move through it, and erupting\nvolcanoes? So far, his way of dealing with these things had been to ignore them.\nOr, rather, to let Vin worry about them.\nThat's really what has me worried, he thought. Losing the woman I love is bad enough. But,\nlosing the one I trusted to fix all this . . . that's truly frightening.\nIt was an odd realization. The deep truth was, he really did trust Vin as more than a person. She was"

She was\nmore like a force. Almost a god, even? It seemed silly, thinking about that directly. She was his wife.\nEven if he was a member of the Church of the Survivor, it felt wrong to worship her, to think her divine.\nAnd he didn't, not really. But he did trust her. Vin was a person of instinct, while Elend was one of\nlogic and thought. Sometimes, it seemed she could do the impossible simply because she didn't stop to\nthink about how impossible it really was. If Elend came to a cliff, he stopped, gauging the distance to the\nother side. Vin just jumped.\nWhat would happen on the day she didn't reach the other side? What if the events they were tied up in\nwere bigger than two people could hope to solve, even if one of those people was Vin? As he\nconsidered it, even the possibility of discovering helpful information in the cache at Fadrex had been a\nslim hope.\nWe need help, Elend thought with frustration. He stopped in the ash, the darkness closing around him\nas night proper finally fell. The mists swirled.\nHelp. So, what did that mean? Help from some mysterious god like the ones that Sazed had once\npreached about? Elend had never known a god other than the Lord Ruler. And he'd never really had\nfaith in that creature—though, meeting Yomen had changed his perspective on how some people\nworshipped the Lord Ruler.\nElend stood, looking up at the sky, watching the flakes of ash fall. Continuing their silent, yet ceaseless,\nbarrage against the land. Like the raven feathers of a soft pillow used to suffocate a sleeping victim.\nWe are doomed, he thought. Behind him, the koloss stopped their march, waiting upon his silent\norder. That's it. It's all going to end.\nThe realization wasn't crushing. It was gentle, like a final tendril of smoke from a dying candle. He\nsuddenly knew that they couldn't fight—that everything they'd done over the last year had been pointless.\nElend slumped to his knees. The ash came up to his chest. Perhaps this was one final reason why he'd\nwanted to walk home alone. When others were around, he felt as if he had to be optimistic. But, alone,\nhe could face the truth.\nAnd there, in the ash, he finally just gave up.\nSomeone knelt down beside him.\nElend jumped backward, scrambling to his feet and scattering ash. He flared pewter belatedly, giving\nhimself the tense strength of a Mistborn about to attack. But, there was nobody beside him. He froze,\nwondering if he'd been imagining things. And then, burning tin and squinting in the darkness of the ashen\nnight, he finally saw it. A creature of mist.\nIt wasn't really composed of mist. Rather, it was outlined in mist. The random shiftings suggested its\nfigure, which was roughly that of a man. Elend had seen this creature twice before. The first time, it had\nappeared to him in the wilderness of the Northern Dominance.\nThe second time, it had stabbed him in the gut, leaving him to bleed to death."

It just pointed, as if trying to get me to go\nsomewhere. I didn't understand what it meant then either.\n\"Look,\" Elend said, suddenly feeling exhausted. \"If you want to say something, why not just say it?\"\nThe mist spirit stood quietly in the mists.\n\"At least write it,\" Elend said. \"The pointing just isn't working.\" He knew that the creature—whatever it\nwas—had some corporeality.

Death, death, death.\n\"Well . . . that's pleasant,\" Elend said, feeling an eerie chill.\nThe mist spirit seemed to slump. It knelt in the ash, making no impression in the ground.\nSuch odd words to write, Elend thought, when it seemed to be trying to get me to trust it. . . \"It\ncan change your words, can't it?\" Elend asked. \"The other force. It can rewrite pieces of text on paper,\nso why not things scratched in ash?\"\nThe mist spirit looked up.\n\"That's why you ripped the corners off of Sazed's papers,\" Elend said. \"You couldn't write him a note,\nbecause the words would just get changed. So, you had to do other things. More blunt things—like\npointing.\"\nThe creature stood.\n\"So, write more slowly,\" Elend said. \"Use exaggerated motions. I'll watch the movements of your arm,\nand form the letters in my mind.\"\nThe mist spirit began immediately, waving its arms about. Elend cocked his head, watching its motions.\nHe couldn't make any sense of them, let alone form letters out of them.\n\"Wait,\" he said, holding up a hand. \"That isn't working. Either it's changing things, or you just don't\nknow your letters.\"\nSilence.\nWait, Elend thought, glancing at the text on the ground. If the text changed . . .\n\"It's here, isn't it,\" he said, feeling a sudden and icy chill. \"It's here with us now.\"\nThe mist spirit remained still.\n\"Bounce around for a yes,\" Elend said.\nThe mist spirit began to wave its arms as it had before."

Elend looked down at the vial. \"I don't\nunderstand.\"\nThe creature fell still. It was getting more and more vague, as if it were evaporating.\n\"Wait!\" Elend said, stepping forward. \"I have another question. One more before you go!\"\nIt stared him in the eyes.\n\"Can we beat it?\" Elend asked softly. \"Can we survive?\"\nStillness. Then, the creature waved just briefly. Not a vigorous wave—more of a hesitant one. An\nuncertain one. It evaporated, maintaining that same wave, the mists becoming indistinct and leaving no\nsign that the creature had been there.\nElend stood in the darkness. He turned and glanced at his koloss army, who waited like the trunks of\ndark trees in the distance. Then he turned back, scanning for any further signs of the mist spirit. Finally, he\njust turned and began to tromp his way back to Fadrex. The koloss followed.\nHe felt . . . stronger. It was silly—the mist spirit hadn't really given him any useful information. It had\nbeen almost like a child. The things it had told him were mostly just confirmations of what he'd already\nsuspected.\nYet, as he walked, he moved with more determination. If only because he knew there were things in\nthe world he didn't understand—and that meant, perhaps, there were possibilities he didn't see.\nPossibilities for survival.\nPossibilities to land safely on the other side of the chasm, even when logic told him not to jump.\nI don't know why Preservation decided to use his last bit of life appearing to Elend during his trek\nback to Fadrex. From what I understand, Elend didn't really learn that much from the meeting.\nBy then, of course, Preservation was but a shadow of himself—and that shadow was under\nimmense destructive pressure from Ruin.\nPerhaps Preservation—or, the remnants of what he had been—wanted to get Elend alone. Or,\nperhaps he saw Elend kneeling in that field, and knew that the emperor of men was very close to\njust lying down in the ash, never to rise again. Either way, Preservation did appear, and in doing\nso exposed himself to Ruin's attacks. Gone were the days when Preservation could turn away an\nInquisitor with a bare gesture, gone—even—were the days when he could strike a man down to\nbleed and die.\nBy the time Elend saw the \"mist spirit,\" Preservation must have been barely coherent. I wonder\nwhat Elend would have done, had he known that he was in the presence of a dying god—that on\nthat night, he had been the last witness of Preservation's passing. If Elend had waited just a few\nmore minutes on that ashen field, he would have seen a body—short of stature, black hair,\nprominent nose—fall from the mists and slump dead into the ash."

The world was dying. Its gods had to die\nwith it.\n56\nSPOOK STOOD IN THE DARK CAVERN, looking at his board and paper. He had it propped up,\nlike an artist's canvas, though he wasn't sketching images, but ideas. Kelsier had always outlined his plans\nfor the crew on a charcoal board. It seemed like a good idea, even though Spook wasn't explaining plans\nto a crew, but rather trying to work them out for himself.\nThe trick was going to be getting Quellion to expose himself as an Allomancer before the people. Durn\nhad told them what to look for, and the crowds would be ready, waiting for confirmation of what they\nhad been told. However, for Spook's plan to work, he'd have to catch the Citizen in a public place, then\nget the man to use his powers in a way that was obvious to those watching.\nI can't let him just Push on a distant metal, then, he thought, scratching a note to himself on the\ncharcoal board. I'll need him to shoot into the air, or perhaps blast some coins. Something visible,\nsomething we can tell everyone to watch for.\nThat would be tough, but Spook was confident. He had several ideas scratched up on the board,\nranging from attacking Quellion at a rally to tricking him into using his powers when he thought nobody\nwas looking. Slowly, the thoughts were jelling into a cohesive plan.\nI really can do this, Spook thought, smiling. I always felt such awe for Kelsier's leadership\nabilities. But, it's not as hard as I thought.\nOr, at least, that was what he told himself. He tried not to think about the consequences of a failure.\nTried not to think about the fact that he still held Beldre hostage. Tried not to worry about the fact that\nwhen he awoke some mornings—his tin having burned away during the night—his body felt completely\nnumb, unable to feel anything until he got more metal as fuel. Tried not to focus on the riots and incidents\nhis appearances, speeches, and work among the people were causing.\nKelsier kept telling him not to worry. That should be enough for him. Shouldn't it?\nAfter a few minutes, he heard someone approaching, footsteps quiet—but not too quiet for him—on\nthe stone. The rustle of a dress, yet without perfume, let him know exactly who it was.\n\"Spook?\"\nHe lowered the charcoal and turned. Beldre stood at the far side of his \"room.\" He'd made himself an\nalcove between several of the storage shelves, partitioned off with sheets—his own personal office. The\nCitizen's sister wore a beautiful noble gown of green and white.\nSpook smiled. \"You like the dresses?\"\nShe looked down, flushing slightly. \"I . . . haven't worn anything like this in years.\"\n\"Nobody in this city has,\" Spook said, setting down the charcoal and wiping his fingers on a rag. \"But,\nthen, that makes it pretty easy to get them, if you know which buildings to loot. It looks like I matched"

The gown really did look good on her, and Spook found it a\nlittle difficult to focus as she drew closer. She eyed his charcoal board, then frowned. \"Is . . . that\nsupposed to make any sense?\"\nSpook shook himself free of his trance. The charcoal board was a mess of scratches and notations.\nThat, in itself, would have made it difficult enough to read. There was, however, something else that made\nit even more incomprehensible.\n\"It's mostly written in Eastern street slang,\" Spook said.\n\"The language you grew up speaking?\" she said, fingering the board's edge, careful not to touch the\nwriting itself, lest she smudge it.\nSpook nodded.\n\"Even the words are different,\" she said. \"Wasing?\"\n\"It kind of means 'was doing,' \" Spook explained. \"You start sentences with it. 'Wasing the run of\nthere' would mean 'I was running to that place.' \"\n\"Wasing the where of how of the finds,\" Beldre said, smiling slightly to herself as she read from the\nboard. \"It sounds like gibberish!\"\n\"Wasing the how of wanting the doing,\" Spook said, smiling, falling into a full accent. Then he flushed,\nturning away.\n\"What?\" she asked.\nWhy do I always act so foolish around her? he thought. The others always made fun of my\nslang—even Kelsier thought it was silly. Now I start speaking it before her?\nHe'd been feeling confident and sure as he studied his plans before she arrived. Why was it that the girl\ncould always make him fall out of his leadership role and go back to being the old Spook? The Spook\nwho had never been important.\n\"You shouldn't be ashamed of the accent,\" Beldre said. \"I think it's kind of charming.\"\n\"You just said it was gibberish,\" Spook said, turning back to her.\n\"But that's the best part!\" Beldre said. \"It's gibberish on purpose, right?\"\nSpook remembered with fondness how his parents had responded to his adoption of the slang. It had\nbeen a kind of power, being able to say things that only his friends could understand. Of course, he'd\nstarted speaking in it so much that it had been hard to switch back.\n\"So,\" Beldre said, eyeing the board. \"What does it say?\"\nSpook hesitated. \"Just random thoughts,\" he said. She was his enemy—he had to remember that.\n\"Oh,\" she said. Something unreadable crossed her face, then she turned away from the board.\nHer brother always banished her from his conferences, Spook thought. Never told her anything\nimportant. Left her feeling like she was useless. . . .\n\"I need to get your brother to use his Allomancy in front of the people,\" Spook found himself saying.\n\"To let them see that he's a hypocrite.\"\nBeldre looked back.\n\"The board is filled with my ideas,\" Spook said. \"Most of them aren't very good. I'm kind of leaning\ntoward just attacking him, making him defend himself.\"\n\"That won't work,\" Beldre said.\n\"Why not?\""

He wouldn't expose himself like that.\"\n\"If I threaten him strongly enough he will.\"\nBeldre shook her head. \"You promised not to hurt him. Remember?\"\n\"No,\" Spook said, raising a finger. \"I promised to try to find another way. And, I don't intend to kill\nhim. I just need to make him think that I'd kill him.\"\nBeldre fell silent again. His heart lurched.\n\"I won't do it, Beldre,\" Spook said. \"I won't kill him.\"\n\"You promise that?\"\nSpook nodded.\nShe looked up at him, then smiled. \"I want to write him a letter. Perhaps I can talk him into listening to\nyou; we could avoid the need for this in the first place.\"\n\"All right . . .\" Spook said. \"But, you realize I'll have to read the letter to make certain you're not\nrevealing anything that could hurt my position.\"\nBeldre nodded.\nOf course, he'd do more than read it. He'd rewrite it on another sheet of paper, changing the line\norder, and then add a few unimportant words. He'd worked on too many thieving crews to be unaware\nof ciphers. But, assuming that Beldre was being honest with him, a letter from her to Quellion was a good\nidea. It couldn't help but strengthen Spook's position.\nHe opened his mouth to ask whether or not her sleeping accommodations were acceptable, but cut\nhimself off as he heard someone approaching. Harder footsteps this time. Captain Goradel, he guessed.\nSure enough, the soldier appeared around the corner to Spook's \"room\" a short time later.\n\"My lord,\" the soldier said. \"You should see this.\"\nThe soldiers were gone.\nSazed looked through the window with the others, inspecting the empty plot of ground where\nQuellion's troops had been camped for the last few weeks, watching the Ministry building.\n\"When did they leave?\" Breeze asked, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.\n\"Just now,\" Goradel explained.\nThe move felt ominous to Sazed for some reason. He stood beside Spook, Breeze, and\nGoradel—though the others seemed to take the soldiers' retreat as a good sign.\n\"Well, it will make sneaking out easier,\" Goradel noted.\n\"More than that,\" Spook said. \"It means I can incorporate our own soldiers in the plan against\nQuellion. We'd never have gotten them out of the building secretly with half an army on our doorstep, but\nnow . . .\"\n\"Yes,\" Goradel said. \"But where did they go? Do you think Quellion is suspicious of us?\"\nBreeze snorted. \"That, my dear man, sounds like a question for your scouts. Why not have them\nsearch out where that army went?\"\nGoradel nodded. But then, to Sazed's slight surprise, the soldier looked toward Spook for a\nconfirmation. Spook nodded, and the captain moved off to give the orders.\nHe looks to the boy over Breeze and I, Sazed thought. He shouldn't have been surprised. Sazed"

Sazed\nhimself had agreed to let Spook take the lead, and to Goradel, all three of them—Sazed, Breeze,\nSpook—were probably equal. All were in Elend's inner circle, and of the three, Spook was the best\nwarrior. It made sense for Goradel to look to him as a source of authority.\nIt just felt strange to see Spook giving orders to the soldiers. Spook had always been so quiet during\nthe days of the original crew. And yet, Sazed was beginning to respect the boy too. Spook knew how to\ngive orders in a way that Sazed could not, and he had shown remarkable foresight in his preparations in\nUrteau, as well as his plans to overthrow Quellion. He had a flair for the dramatic that Breeze kept saying\nwas remarkable.\nAnd yet, there was that bandage on the boy's eyes, and the other things he hadn't explained. Sazed\nknew that he should have pushed harder for answers, but the truth was that he trusted Spook. Sazed had\nknown Spook from the lad's young teenage years, when he'd barely been capable of communicating with\nothers.\nAs Goradel moved off, Spook looked to Sazed and Breeze. \"Well?\"\n\"Quellion is planning something,\" Breeze said. \"Seems too early to jump to conclusions, though.\"\n\"I agree,\" Spook said. \"For now, we go forward with the plan.\"\nWith that, they split up. Sazed turned, making his way back down and over to the far side of the\ncavern—to where a large group of soldiers worked in an area well lit with lanterns. On his arms, he wore\nthe familiar weight of his copperminds—two on his forearms, two on his upper arms. In them sat the\nknowledge of engineering he needed to complete the task Spook had assigned him.\nLately, Sazed didn't know what to think. Each time he climbed the ladder and looked out over the\ncity, he saw worse signs. The ashfalls were heavier. The earthquakes were growing more and more\nfrequent, and more and more violent. The mists were lingering later and later in the day. The sky grew\ndark, the red sun more like a vast bleeding scar than a source of light and life. The ashmounts made the\nhorizon red even during the night.\nIt seemed to him that the end of the world should be a time when men found faith, not a time when\nthey lost it. Yet, the little time that he'd devoted to studying the religions in his portfolio had not been\nencouraging. Twenty more religions eliminated, leaving just thirty potential candidates.\nHe shook his head to himself, moving among the toiling soldiers. Several groups worked on wooden\ncontraptions filled with rocks—weight systems that would fall to block off the water running into the\ncavern. Others worked on the system of pulleys that would lower the mechanism. After about a half hour\nor so, Sazed determined that they were all doing their tasks well, and returned to his calculations.\nHowever, as he walked to his table, he saw Spook approaching him.\n\"Riots,\" Spook said, falling into step beside Sazed."

Some people started a fire, and the soldiers guarding us were needed\nto put it out before the whole city went up. There's a lot more wood here than there is in Central\nDominance cities.\"\nSazed frowned. \"Our actions here are becoming dangerous, I fear.\"\nSpook shrugged. \"Seems like a good thing to me. This city is on the edge of snapping, Saze. Just like\nLuthadel was when we took control.\"\n\"Only the presence of Elend Venture kept that city from destroying itself,\" Sazed said quietly.\n\"Kelsier's revolution could easily have turned into a disaster.\"\n\"It will be all right,\" Spook said.\nSazed eyed the young man as the two of them walked through the cavern. Spook seemed to be trying\nvery hard to project an air of confidence. Perhaps Sazed was just growing cynical, but he found it difficult\nto be as optimistic as Spook.\n\"You don't believe me,\" Spook said.\n\"I'm sorry, Lord Spook,\" Sazed said. \"It's not that . . . it's just that I seem to have trouble having faith\nin anything lately.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nThey walked silently for a while, eventually finding themselves at the edge of the glassy underground\nlake. Sazed paused beside the waters, his worries chewing at his insides. He stood for a long moment,\nfeeling frustrated, but not really having an outlet.\n\"Don't you even worry, Spook?\" Sazed finally asked. \"Worry that we'll fail?\"\n\"I don't know,\" Spook said, shuffling.\n\"And, it's so much more than this,\" Sazed said, waving back at the work crews. \"The very sky seems\nto be our enemy. The land is dying. Don't you wonder what good any of this is? Why we even struggle?\nWe're all doomed anyway!\"\nSpook flushed. Then, finally, he looked down. \"I don't know,\" he repeated. \"I . . . I understand what\nyou're doing, Sazed. You're trying to find out if I doubt myself. I guess you can see through me.\"\nSazed frowned, but Spook wasn't looking.\n\"You're right,\" the young man said then, wiping his brow, \"I do wonder if I'll fail. I guess Tindwyl\nwould be annoyed at me, wouldn't she? She didn't think that leaders should doubt themselves.\"\nThat gave Sazed pause. What am I doing? he thought, horrified at his outburst. Is this what I've\nreally become? During most of my life, I resisted the Synod, rebelling against my own people. Yet,\nI was at peace, confident that I was doing the right thing.\nNow I come here, where people need me most, and I just sit around and snap at my friends,\ntelling them that we're just going to die?\n\"But,\" Spook said, looking up, \"though I doubt myself, I still think we'll be all right.\"\nSazed was surprised at the hope he saw in the boy's eyes. That's what I've lost.\n\"How can you say that?\" Sazed asked."

Well, do you remember that question you asked me\nwhen you first got here? We were standing by the lake, just over there. You asked me about faith. You\nasked what good it was, if it just led people to hurt each other, like Quellion's faith in the Survivor has\ndone.\"\nSazed looked out over the lake. \"Yes,\" he said softly. \"I remember.\"\n\"I've been thinking about that ever since,\" Spook said. \"And . . . I think I might have an answer.\"\n\"Please.\"\n\"Faith,\" Spook said, \"means that it doesn't matter what happens. You can trust that somebody is\nwatching. Trust that somebody will make it all right.\"\nSazed frowned.\n\"It means that there will always be a way,\" Spook whispered, staring forward, eyes glazed, as if seeing\nthings that Sazed could not.\nYes, Sazed thought. That is what I have lost. And it's what I need to get back.\nI have come to see that each power has three aspects: a physical one, which can be seen in the\ncreations made by Ruin and Preservation; a spiritual one in the unseen energy that permeates all\nof the world; and a cognitive one in the minds which controlled that energy.\nThere is more to this. Much more that even I do not yet comprehend.\n57\nYOU SHOULD KILL THEM.\nVin looked up as she heard a pair of guards pass the door to her cell. There was one good thing about\nRuin's voice—it tended to warn her when people were nearby, even if it did always tell her to kill them.\nA part of her did wonder if, in fact, she was mad. After all, she saw and heard things that nobody else\ncould. However, if she were mad, there would really be no way for her to realize it. So, she simply\ndecided to accept what she heard, and move on.\nIn truth, she was glad for Ruin's voice on occasion. Other than Ruin, she was alone in the cell. All was\nstill. Even the soldiers did not speak—likely at Yomen's orders. Plus, each time Ruin spoke, she felt as if\nshe learned something. For instance, she had learned that Ruin could either manifest in person or affect\nher from a distance. When its actual presence was not with her in the cell, Ruin's words were far more\nsimple and vague.\nTake, for instance, Ruin's order that she kill the guards. She couldn't follow that suggestion, not from\nwithin the cell. It wasn't so much a specific order as it was an attempt to change her inclinations. Again,\nthat reminded her of Allomancy, which could exert a general influence over a person's emotions.\nGeneral influence . . .\nSomething suddenly occurred to her. She quested out, and—sure enough—she could still feel the\nthousand koloss that Elend had given her.

As she considered them, both plans seemed flawed. Sending them to Fadrex would just get\nthem killed, as well as risk upsetting whatever plans Elend had for a potential attack. She could send\nthem to find Elend, but that would probably just get them killed by the camp guards, who would be afraid\nthey were bloodlusting. Plus, what would she have them do if they did get to him? She could order them\nto take actions, like attack or pick someone up, but she'd never tried something as delicate as ordering\none to speak certain words.\nShe tried forming those words in her head and getting them to the koloss, but all she sensed back was\nconfusion. She'd have to work on that some more. And, as she considered, she wondered if getting a\nmessage to Elend would really be the best way to use them. It would let Ruin know about a potential tool\nshe had that, maybe, he hadn't noticed.\n\"I see that he finally found a cell for you,\" a voice said.\nVin looked up, and there he was. Still wearing Reen's form, Ruin stood in the small cell with her. He\nmaintained a straight-backed posture, standing almost benevolently over her. Vin sat up on her cot. She'd\nnever thought that of all her metals, she would miss bronze so much. When Ruin returned to visit in\n\"person,\" burning bronze had let her feel him via bronzepulses and gave her warning that he had arrived,\neven if he didn't appear to her.\n\"I'll admit that I'm disappointed in you, Vin,\" Ruin said. He used Reen's voice, but he imbued it with a\nsense of . . . age. Of quiet wisdom. The fatherly nature of that voice, mixed with Reen's face and her own\nknowledge of the thing's desire to destroy, was disturbing.\n\"The last time you were captured and locked away without metals,\" Ruin continued, \"not a night\npassed before you'd killed the Lord Ruler and overthrown the empire. Now you've been soundly\nimprisoned for what . . . a week now?\"\nVin didn't respond. Why come taunt me? Does it expect to learn something?\nRuin shook its head. \"I would have thought at the very least that you'd have killed Yomen.\"\n\"Why are you so concerned with his death?\" Vin asked. \"It seems to me that he's on your side.\"\nRuin shook its head, standing with hands clasped behind its back. \"You still don't understand, I see.\nYou're all on my side, Vin. I created you. You're my tools—each and every one of you. Zane, Yomen,\nyou, your dear Emperor Venture . . .\"\n\"No. Zane was yours, and Yomen is obviously misguided. But Elend . . . he'll fight against you.\"\n\"But he can't,\" Ruin said. \"That's what you refuse to understand, child. You cannot fight me, for by the\nmere act of fighting you advance my goals.\"\n\"Evil men, perhaps, help you,\" Vin said. \"But not Elend. He's a good person, and not even you can\ndeny that.\""

Good\nmen will kill as quickly for what they want as evil men—only the things they want are different.\"\nVin fell silent.\nRuin shook its head. \"I keep trying to explain. This process we are engaged in, the end of all\nthings—it's not a fight, but a simple culmination of inevitability. Can any man make a pocket watch that\nwon't eventually wind down? Can you imagine a lantern that won't eventually burn out? All things end.\nThink of me as a caretaker—the one who watches the shop and makes certain that the lights are turned\nout, that everything is cleaned up, once closing time arrives.\"\nFor a moment, he made her question. There was some truth in his words, and seeing the changes in\nthe land these last few years—changes that started before Ruin was even released—did make her\nwonder.\nYet, something about the conversation bothered her. If what Ruin said was completely true, then why\ndid he care about her? Why return and speak to her?\n\"I guess that you've won, then,\" she said quietly.\n\"Won?\" Ruin asked. \"Don't you understand? There was nothing for me to win, child. Things happen as\nthey must.\"\n\"I see,\" Vin said.\n\"Yes, perhaps you do,\" Ruin said. \"I think that you just might be able to.\" It turned and began to walk\nquietly from one side of the cell toward the other. \"You are a piece of me, you know. Beautiful destroyer.\nBlunt and effective. Of all those I've claimed over this brief thousand years, you are the only one I think\njust might be able to understand me.\"\nWhy, Vin thought, it's gloating! That's why Ruin is here—because it wants to make certain that\nsomeone understands what it has accomplished! There was a feeling of pride and victory in Ruin's\neyes. They were human emotions, emotions that Vin could understand.\nAt that moment, Ruin stopped being an it in her mind, and instead became a he.\nVin began to think—for the first time—that she could find a way to beat Ruin. He was powerful,\nperhaps even incomprehensible. But she had seen humanity in him, and that humanity could be deceived,\nmanipulated, and broken. Perhaps it was this same conclusion that Kelsier had drawn, after looking into\nthe Lord Ruler's eyes that fateful night when he had been captured. She finally felt as if she understood\nhim, and what it must have felt like to undertake something so bold as the defeat of the Lord Ruler.\nBut Kelsier had years to plan, Vin thought. I . . . I don't even know how long I have. Not long, I\nwould guess. Even as she thought, another earthquake began. The walls trembled, and Vin heard guards\ncursing in the hallway as something fell and broke.

If Ruin had power to destroy, then there was something that\nopposed him. It had to be. Ruin had an opposite, an opponent. Or, he once had.\n\"What did you do to him?\" Vin asked.\nRuin hesitated, frowning as he turned toward her.\n\"Your opposite,\" Vin said. \"The one who once stopped you from destroying the world.\"\nRuin was silent for a long moment. Then he smiled, and Vin saw something chilling in that smile. A\nknowledge that he was right. Vin was part of him. She understood him.\n\"Preservation is dead,\" Ruin said.\n\"You killed him?\"\nRuin shrugged. \"Yes, but no. He gave of himself to craft a cage. Though his throes of agony have\nlasted several thousand years, now, finally, he is gone. And the bargain has come to its fruition.\"\nPreservation, Vin thought, a piece of a gigantic whole clicking into place. The opposite of Ruin. A\nforce like that couldn't have destroyed his enemy, because he would represent the opposite of\ndestruction. But imprisonment, that would be within his powers.\nImprisonment that ended when I gave up the power at the Well.\n\"And so you see the inevitability,\" Ruin said softly.\n\"You couldn't create it yourself, could you?\" Vin asked. \"The world, life. You can't create, you can\nonly destroy.\"\n\"He couldn't create either,\" Ruin said. \"He could only preserve. Preservation is not creation.\"\n\"And so you worked together,\" Vin said.\n\"Both with a promise,\" Ruin said. \"My promise was to work with him to create you—life that thinks,\nlife that loves.\"\n\"And his promise?\" Vin asked, fearing that she knew the answer.\n\"That I could destroy you eventually,\" Ruin said softly. \"And I have come to claim what was promised\nme. The only point in creating something is to watch it die. Like a story that must come to a climax, what\nI have done will not be fulfilled until the end has arrived.\"\nIt can't be true, Vin thought. Preservation. If he really represents a power in the universe, then"

If he really represents a power in the universe, then\nhe couldn't really have been destroyed, could he?\n\"I know what you are thinking,\" Ruin said. \"You cannot enlist Preservation's power. He is dead. He\ncouldn't kill me, you see. He could only imprison me.\"\nYes. I figured that last part out already. You really can't read my mind, can you?\nRuin continued. \"It was a villainous act, I must say. Preservation tried to escape our bargain. Would\nyou not call that an evil deed? It is as I said before—good and evil have little to do with ruin or\npreservation. An evil man will protect that which he desires as surely as a good man.\"\nBut something is keeping Ruin from destroying the world now, she thought. For all his words\nabout stories and endings, he is not a force that would wait for an \"appropriate\" moment. There\nis more to this, more that I'm not understanding.\nWhat is holding him back?\n\"I've come to you,\" Ruin said, \"because I want you, at least, to watch and see. To know. For it has\ncome.\"\nVin perked up. \"What? The end?\"\nRuin nodded.\n\"How long?\" Vin asked.\n\"Days,\" Ruin said. \"But not weeks.\"\nVin felt a chill, realizing something. He had come to her, finally revealing himself, because she was\ncaptured. He thought that there was no further chance for mankind. He assumed that he had won.\nWhich means that there is a way to beat him, she thought with determination. And it involves me.\nBut I can't do it here, or he wouldn't have come to gloat.\nAnd that meant she had to get free. Quickly.\nOnce you begin to understand these things, you can see how Ruin was trapped even though\nPreservation's mind was gone, expended to create the prison. Though Preservation's\nconsciousness was mostly destroyed, his spirit and body were still in force. And, as an opposite\nforce of Ruin, these could still prevent Ruin from destroying.\nOr, at least, keep him from destroying things too quickly. Once his mind was \"freed\" from its\nprison the destruction accelerated quickly.\n58\n\"THROW YOUR WEIGHT HERE,\" Sazed said, pointing at a wooden lever. \"The counterweights\nwill fall, swinging down all four floodgates and stemming the flow into the cavern. I warn you,\nhowever—the explosion of water above will be rather spectacular. We should be able to fill the city's\ncanals in a matter of hours, and I suspect that a portion of the northern city will be flooded.\"\n\"To dangerous levels?\" Spook asked.\n\"I do not think so,\" Sazed said. \"The water will burst out through the conduits in the interchange\nbuilding beside us. I've inspected the equipment there, and it appears sound. The water should flow\ndirectly into the canals, and from there exit the city. Either way, I would not want to be in those\nstreetslots when this water comes. The current will be quite swift.\"\n\"I've taken care of that,\" Spook said. \"Durn is going to make certain the people know to be clear of\nthe waterways.\""

Spook couldn't help but be impressed. The complicated construct of wood, gears, and\nwire looked like it should have taken months to build, not weeks. Large nets of rocks weighed down the\nfour gates, which hung, ready to block off the river.\n\"This is amazing, Saze,\" Spook said. \"With a sign as spectacular as the reappearance of the canal\nwaters, the people will be certain to listen to us instead of the Citizen.\" Breeze and Durn's men had been\nworking hard over the last few weeks, whispering to the people to watch for a miracle from the Survivor\nof the Flames. Something extraordinary, something to prove—once and for all—who was the rightful\nmaster of the city.\n\"It is the best I could do,\" Sazed said with a modest bow of the head. \"The seals won't be perfectly\ntight, of course. However, that should matter little.\"\n\"Men?\" Spook said, turning to four of Goradel's soldiers. \"You understand what you are to do?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the lead soldier said. \"We wait for a messenger, then throw the lever there.\"\n\"If no messenger comes,\" Spook said, \"throw the switch at nightfall.\"\n\"And,\" Sazed said, raising a finger, \"don't forget to twist the sealing mechanism in the other room,\nplugging the water flow out of this chamber. Otherwise, the lake will eventually empty. Better that we\nkeep this reservoir full, just in case.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the soldier said with a nod.\nSpook turned, looking back over the cavern. Soldiers bustled about, preparing. He was going to need\nmost of them for the night's activities. They looked eager—they'd spent too long holed up in the cavern\nand the building above. To the side, Beldre regarded Sazed's contraption with interest. Spook broke\naway from the soldiers, approaching her with a quick step.\n\"You're really going to do it?\" she said. \"Return the water to the canals?\"\nSpook nodded.\n\"I sometimes imagined what it would be like to have the waters back,\" she said. \"The city wouldn't feel\nas barren—it would become important, like it was during the early days of the Final Empire. All those\nbeautiful waterways. No more ugly gashes in the ground.\"\n\"It will be a wonderful sight,\" Spook said, smiling.\nBeldre just shook her head. \"It . . . amazes me that you can be such different people at the same time.\nHow can the man who would do such a beautiful thing for my city also plan such destruction?\"\n\"Beldre, I'm not planning to destroy your city.\"\n\"Just its government.\"\n\"I do what needs to be done.\"\n\"Men say that so easily,\" Beldre said. \"Yet, everybody seems to have a different opinion of what\n'needs' to be done.\"\n\"Your brother had his chance,\" Spook said.\nBeldre looked down.

I am protected by the Survivor himself. You will not have\nthis city, tyrant.\nBeldre looked up. \"Don't do it,\" she whispered. \"Give him more time. Please.\"\nSpook hesitated.\n\"There is no more time,\" Kelsier whispered. \"Do what must be done.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" Spook said, turning from her. \"Stay with the soldiers—I'm leaving four men to guard you.\nNot to keep you from fleeing, though they will do that. I want you inside this cavern. I can't promise that\nthe streets will be safe.\"\nHe heard her sniffle quietly behind him. He left her standing there, then walked toward the gathering\ngroup of soldiers. One man brought Spook his dueling canes and singed cloak. Goradel stood at the\nfront of his soldiers, looking proud. \"We're ready, my lord.\"\nBreeze walked up beside him, shaking his head, dueling cane tapping the ground. He sighed. \"Well,\nhere we go again. . . .\"\nThe evening's occasion was a speech Quellion had been publicizing for some time. He had stopped\nexecutions recently, as if finally realizing that the deaths were contributing to the instability of his rule. He\napparently intended to swing back toward benevolence, holding rallies, emphasizing the wonderful things\nhe was doing for the city.\nSpook walked alone, a little ahead of Breeze, Allrianne, and Sazed, who chatted behind. Some of\nGoradel's soldiers followed as well, wearing common Urteau garb. Spook had split their force, sending it\nby different paths. It wasn't dark yet—to Spook the falling sun was bright, forcing him to wear his\nblindfold and spectacles. Quellion liked to hold his speeches in the evening, so that the mists arrived\nduring them. He liked the implied connection to the Survivor.\nA figure hobbled out of a side streetslot next to Spook. Durn walked with a stooped posture, a cloak\nobscuring his figure. Spook respected the twisted man's insistence on leaving the security of the Harrows,\ngoing out to run jobs himself. Perhaps that was why he'd ended up as leader of the city's underground.\n\"People are gathering, as expected,\" Durn said, coughing quietly. \"Some of your soldiers are already\nthere.\"\nSpook nodded.\n\"Things are . . . unsettled in the city,\" Durn said. \"It worries me. Segments I can't control have already\nstarted looting some of the prohibited noble mansions. My men are all busy trying to get people out of the\nstreetslots.\"\n\"It will be all right,\" Spook said. \"Most of the populace will be at the speech.\"\nDurn was silent for a moment. \"Word is that Quellion is going to use his speech to denounce you, then\nfinally order an attack on the Ministry building where you're staying.\"\n\"It's a good thing we won't be there, then,\" Spook said. \"He shouldn't have withdrawn his soldiers,"

Once this night is through, the city will be yours. Treat it better\nthan Quellion did.\"\n\"I will,\" Spook said.\n\"My men will create a disturbance for you at the meeting. Farewell.\" Durn took the next left,\ndisappearing down another streetslot alleyway.\nAhead, the crowds were already gathering. Spook put up the hood of his cloak, keeping his eyes\nobscured as he wove his way through the crowd. He quickly left Sazed and the others behind, pushing\nhis way up a ramp to the old city square—the place Quellion had chosen for his speech. His men had\nerected a wooden stage, from which the Citizen could face the crowd. The speech was already in\nprogress. Spook stopped just a short distance away from a guard patrol. Many of Quellion's soldiers\nsurrounded the stage, eyeing the crowd.\nMinutes passed, and Spook spent them listening to Quellion's voice ring, yet paying no attention to the\nwords. Ash fell around him, dusting the crowd. Mists began to twist in the air.\nHe listened, listened with ears no other man had. He used Allomancy's strange ability to filter and\nignore—hearing through the chatter and whispers and shuffles and coughs, just as he could somehow see\nthrough the obscuring mists. He heard the city. Yells in the distance.\nIt was beginning.\n\"Too fast!\" a voice whispered, a beggar moving up to Spook's side. \"Durn sends word. Riots in the\nstreets, ones he didn't start! Durn cannot control them. My lord, the city is beginning to burn!\"\n\"It was a night not unlike this one,\" another voice whispered. Kelsier's voice. \"A glorious night. When I\ntook the city of Luthadel, and made it mine.\"\nA disturbance began at the back of the crowd; Durn's men were causing their distraction. Some of\nQuellion's guards pulled away to quell this nearby riot. The Citizen continued to shout his accusations.\nSpook heard his own name in Quellion's words, but the context was simply noise.\nSpook tilted his head back, looking up at the sky. Ash fell toward him, as if he were sailing through it\ninto the air. Like a Mistborn.\nHis hood fell back. Men around him whispered in surprise.\nA clock rang in the distance. Goradel's soldiers rushed the stage. Around him, Spook could feel a\nglow rising. The fires of rebellion, burning in the city. Just like the night he had overthrown the Lord Ruler.\nThe torches of revolution. Then the people had put Elend on the throne.\nThis time, it would be Spook they elevated.\nWeak no more, he thought. Never weak again!\nThe last of Quellion's soldiers rushed away from the stage, moving into combat with Goradel's men.\nThe crowd shied away from the battle, but nobody ran.

They had been prepared well for the night's\nevents. Many would be waiting, watching for the signs Spook and Durn had promised—signs revealed\njust a few hours before, to minimize the risk of Quellion's spies learning Spook's plan. A miracle in the\ncanals, and proof that Quellion was an Allomancer.\nIf the Citizen—or even any of his guards on the stage—shot coins or used Allomancy to leap into the\nair, the people would see. They would know that they had been deceived. And that would be the end.\nThe crowd surged away from the cursing soldiers, and their withdrawal left Spook standing alone.\nQuellion's voice finally trailed off. Some of his soldiers were rushing up to get him off the stage.\nQuellion's eyes found Spook. Only then did they show fear.\nSpook leaped. He couldn't Steelpush himself, but his legs were fueled by the power of flared pewter.\nHe soared up, easily cresting the lip of the stage, landing in a crouch. He pulled free a dueling cane, then\nrushed the Citizen.\nBehind him, people began to cry out. Spook heard his name, Survivor of the Flames. Survivor. He\nwouldn't just kill Quellion, but destroy him. Undermining his rule, just as Breeze had suggested. At that\nmoment, the Soother and Allrianne would be manipulating the crowd, keeping them from running away in\na panic. Holding them there.\nSo they could watch the show Spook was about to give.\nThe guards at Quellion's side saw Spook too late. He dropped the first one easily, crushing the man's\nskull inside his helmet. Quellion screamed for more help.\nSpook swung at another man, but his target moved out of the way, supernaturally quick. Spook pulled\nto the side just in time to dodge a blow, the weapon grazing the side of his cheek. The man was an\nAllomancer—a pewter burner. The large brute who carried no sword, but instead an obsidian-edged\ncudgel.\nPewter isn't spectacular enough, Spook thought. The people won't know how to tell if a man is\nswinging too quickly or enduring too much. I have to make Quellion shoot coins.\nThe Thug backed away, obviously noting Spook's own increased speed. He kept his weapon raised\nwarily, but did not attack. He just had to stall, letting his companion pull Quellion away. The Thug would\nbe no easy fight—he would be more skilled than Spook, and even stronger.\n\"Your family is free,\" Spook lied quietly. \"We saved them earlier. Help us capture Quellion—he no\nlonger has a hold on you.\"\nThe Thug paused, lowering his weapon.\n\"Kill him!\" Kelsier snapped.\nThat hadn't been Spook's plan, but he responded to the prompting. He dodged inside the Thug's\nreach. The man turned in shock, and as he did, Spook delivered a backhanded blow to the skull.\nSpook's dueling cane shattered.

Spook jumped, sailing across the wooden platform. It was all\nright for him to use Allomancy; he hadn't preached against it. Only Quellion the hypocrite needed to fear\nusing his powers.\nSpook cut down the remaining guard as he landed—the jagged shards of obsidian ripping through\nflesh. The soldier fell, and Quellion spun.\n\"I don't fear you!\" Quellion said, voice shaking. \"I'm protected!\"\n\"Kill him,\" Kelsier ordered, appearing visibly on the stage a short distance away. Usually, the Survivor\nonly spoke in his mind; he hadn't actually appeared since that day in the burning building. It meant\nimportant things were happening.\nSpook grabbed the Citizen by the front of his shirt, yanking him forward. Spook raised the length of\nwood, blood dripping from the obsidian shards onto the side of his hand.\n\"No!\"\nSpook froze at that voice, then glanced to the side. She was there, shoving her way through the\ncrowd, approaching the open space before the stage.\n\"Beldre?\" Spook asked. \"How did you get out of the cavern?\"\nBut, of course, she couldn't hear him. Only Spook's supernatural hearing had allowed him to pick her\nvoice out of the sounds of fear and battle. He met her eyes across the distance, and saw her whispered\nwords more than he heard them.\nPlease. You promised.\n\"Kill him!\"\nQuellion chose that moment to try and pull away. Spook turned, yanking back again—harder this\ntime, nearly ripping Quellion's shirt free as he threw the man down to the wooden platform. Quellion\ncried out in pain, and Spook raised his brutal weapon with both hands.\nSomething sparked in the firelight. Spook barely felt the impact, though it shook him. He stumbled,\nlooking down, seeing blood on his side. Something had pierced the flesh of his left arm and shoulder. Not\nan arrow, though it had moved like one. His arm drooped, and though he couldn't feel the pain, it seemed\nthat his muscles weren't working properly.\nSomething hit me. A . . . coin.\nHe turned. Beldre stood at the front of the crowd, crying, her hand raised toward him.\nShe was there that day I was captured, Spook thought numbly, at her brother's side. He always\nkeeps her near. To protect her, we thought.\nOr the other way around?\nSpook stood up straighter, Quellion whimpering in front of him. Spook's arm dripped a trail of blood\nfrom where Beldre's coin had hit, but he ignored it, staring at her.\n\"You were always the Allomancer,\" he whispered. \"Not your brother.\"\nAnd then, the crowd began to scream—likely prompted by Breeze. \"The Citizen's sister is an\nAllomancer!\"\n\"Hypocrite!\"\n\"Liar!\"\n\"He killed my uncle, yet left his own sister alive!\"\nBeldre cried out as the people, carefully prepared and planted, saw the proof that Spook had"

Didn't it strike you as strange that he'd let her get away from him and enter the enemy's own\nbase? She was sent there to kill you. You, Sazed, and Breeze. The problem is, she was raised a\npampered rich girl. She's not used to killing. She never was. You were never really in danger from her.\"\nThe crowd surged, and Spook spun, worried about Beldre. However, he calmed a bit as he realized\nthat the people were simply pulling her toward the stage. \"Survivor!\" people were chanting. \"Survivor of\nthe Flames!\"\n\"King!\"\nThey cast Beldre before him, pushing her up onto the platform. Her scarlet clothing was ripped, her\nfigure battered, her auburn hair a mess. To the side, Quellion groaned. Spook appeared to have broken\nhis arm without realizing it.\nSpook moved to help Beldre. She was bleeding from several small cuts, but she was alive. And she\nwas crying.\n\"She was his bodyguard,\" Kelsier said, stepping over to Beldre. \"That's why she was always with him.\nQuellion isn't an Allomancer. He never was.\"\nSpook knelt beside the girl, cringing at her bruised form.\n\"Now, you must kill her,\" Kelsier said.\nSpook looked up, blood seeping from the cut on the side of his face, where the Thug had grazed him.\nBlood dripped from his chin. \"What?\"\n\"You want power, Spook?\" Kelsier said, stepping forward. \"You want to be a better Allomancer?\nWell, power must come from somewhere.

It seemed as if he could see the Survivor, though nobody else around\nthem could. \"My lord Kelsier, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\"I gave you pewter, Spook,\" Kelsier said angrily, not looking at Quellion. \"Will you deny me now?\nYou must pull free one of the steel spikes that support this stage.

But . . . the other soldier struck\nanyway, stabbing through his friend and into me.\nSpook stumbled away from Beldre, kneeling beside Quellion. The man cried out as Spook forced him\ndown against the wooden planks.\n\"That's right,\" Kelsier said. \"Kill him first.\"\nBut Spook wasn't listening. He ripped Quellion's shirt, looking at the shoulder and chest. There was\nnothing odd about either. The Citizen's upper arm, however, had a length of metal piercing it. It appeared\nto be bronze. Hand shaking, Spook pulled the metal free. Quellion screamed.\nBut so did Kelsier.\nSpook turned, bloodied bronze spike in his hand. Kelsier was enraged, hands like claws, stepping\nforward.\n\"What are you?\" Spook asked.\nThe thing screamed, but Spook ignored it, looking down at his own chest. He ripped open his shirt,\nexposing the mostly healed wound in his shoulder. A glimmer of metal still shone there, the tip of the\nsword. The sword that had passed through an Allomancer—killing the man—and then entered Spook's\nown body. Kelsier had told him to leave the broken shard there. As a symbol of what Spook had gone\nthrough.\nThe point of the shard protruded from Spook's skin. How had he forgotten about it? How had he\nignored such a relatively large piece of metal inside of his body? Spook reached for it.\n\"No!\" Kelsier said. \"Spook, do you want to go back to being normal? Do you want to be useless\nagain? You'll lose your pewter, and go back to being weak, like you were when you let your uncle die!\"\nSpook wavered."

He reached in with pewter-enhanced fingers and grabbed the steel\nshard that was embedded inside.\nThen, he ripped the bit of metal free, casting it across the stage, crying out at the shock of pain. Kelsier\nvanished immediately. And so did Spook's ability to burn pewter.\nIt hit him all at once—the fatigue of pushing himself so hard during his time in Urteau. The wounds he'd\nbeen ignoring. The sudden explosion of light, sound, smell, and sensation that pewter had let him resist. It\novercame him like a physical force, crushing him down. He collapsed to the platform.\nHe groaned, unable to think anymore. He could simply let the blackness take him. . . .\nHer city is burning.\nBlackness . . .\nThousands will die in the flames.\nThe mists tickled his cheeks.

Then fight when you are beaten!\n\"Lord Spook!\" The voice was faint.\nSurvive!\nWith a scream of pain, Spook flared tin. As the metal always did, it brought a wave of\nsensations—thousands of them, shocking him at once. Pain. Feeling. Hearing. Sounds, smells, lights.\nAnd lucidity.\nSpook forced himself to his knees, coughing. Blood still streamed down his arm. He looked up. Sazed\nwas running toward the platform.\n\"Lord Spook!\" Sazed said, puffing as he arrived. \"Lord Breeze is trying to damp down riots, but we\npushed this city too far, I think! The people will destroy it in their rage.\"\n\"The flames,\" Spook croaked. \"We have to put out the fires. The city is too dry; it has too much\nwood. It will burn, with everyone in it.\"\nSazed looked grave. \"There is no way. We must get out! This riot will destroy us.\"\nSpook glanced to the side. Beldre was kneeling beside her brother. She'd bound his wound, and then\nmade a makeshift sling for his arm. Quellion glanced at Spook, looking dazed. As if he'd just awoken\nfrom a dream.\nSpook stumbled to his feet. \"We won't abandon the city, Sazed.\"\n\"But—\"\n\"No!\" Spook said. \"I ran from Luthadel and left Clubs to die. I will not run again! We can stop the\nflames. We just need water.\"\nSazed paused.\n\"Water,\" Beldre said, standing."

We just need water.\"\nSazed paused.\n\"Water,\" Beldre said, standing.\n\"The canals will fill soon,\" Spook said. \"We can organize fire brigades—use the flood to stop the\nflames.\"\nBeldre glanced down. \"There will be no flood, Spook. The guards you left . . . I attacked them with\ncoins.\"\nSpook felt a chill. \"Dead?\"\nShe shook her head, hair disheveled, her face scratched. \"I don't know,\" she said quietly. \"I didn't\nlook.\"\n\"The waters have not come yet,\" Sazed said. \"They . . . should have been released by now.\"\n\"Then we will bring them!\" Spook snapped. He spun at Quellion, then stumbled, feeling dizzy. \"You!\"\nhe said, pointing at the Citizen. \"You would be king of this city? Well, lead this people, then. Get control\nof them and prepare them to put out the fires.\"\n\"I can't,\" Quellion said. \"They'll kill me for what I've done.\"\nSpook wobbled, light-headed. He steadied himself against a beam, holding his head. Beldre took a\nstep toward him.\nSpook looked up, meeting Quellion's eyes. The fires of the city were so bright that his flared tin made\nit difficult to see. Yet, he dared not release the metal—only the power of noise, heat, and pain was\nkeeping him conscious.\n\"You will go to them,\" Spook said. \"I don't give a damn if they rip you apart, Quellion. You're going\nto try to save this city. If you don't, I'll kill you myself. Do you understand?\"\nThe Citizen froze, then nodded.\n\"Sazed,\" Spook said, \"take him to Breeze and Allrianne. I'm going to the cache. I'll bring the\nfloodwaters to the canals, one way or another. Have Breeze and the others form fire brigades to douse\nthe flames as soon as there is water.\"\nSazed nodded. \"It is a good plan. But Goradel will lead the Citizen. I am coming with you.\"\nSpook nodded wearily. Then, as Sazed moved off to get the guard captain—who had apparently\nestablished a defensive perimeter around the square—Spook climbed from the stage and forced himself\nto begin moving toward the cache.\nSoon, he noticed someone catch up to him. Then, after a few moments, that person passed him and\nran on. Part of his mind knew it was a good thing that Sazed had decided to move on—the Terrisman\nhad created the mechanism that would flood the city. He would throw the lever. Spook wasn't needed.\nKeep moving.\nHe did, walking on, as if each step were in atonement for what he had done to the city. After a short\ntime, he realized that someone was at his side, tying a bandage on his arm.\nHe blinked. \"Beldre?\"\n\"I betrayed you,\" she said, looking down. \"But, I didn't have a choice. I couldn't let you kill him. I . . .\"\n\"You did the right thing,\" Spook said. \"Something . . . something was interfering, Beldre. It had your"

The lair is close. Just up the\nramp.\"\nShe supported him as they walked. Spook smelled the smoke before he got there. He saw the light,\nand felt the heat. He and Beldre climbed up to the top of the ramp, practically crawling, for she was\nnearly as battered as he was. However, Spook knew what he would find.\nThe Ministry building, like so much of the town, was burning. Sazed stood before it, hand raised\nbefore his eyes. To Spook's overenhanced senses, the brilliance of the flames was so great that he had to\nlook away. The heat made him feel as if he were standing just inches from the sun.\nSazed tried to get closer to the building, but was forced back. He turned toward Spook, shielding his\nface. \"It's too hot!\" he said. \"We need to find some water, or perhaps some sand. Put out the fire before\nwe can get below.\"\n\"Too late . . .\" Spook whispered. \"It will take too long.\"\nBeldre turned, looking over her city. To Spook's eyes, smoke seemed to twist and rise everywhere in\nthe bright sky, reaching up, as if to meet the falling ash.\nHe set his jaw, then stumbled forward, toward the fire.\n\"Spook!\" she cried out. But, she needn't have worried. The flames were too hot. The pain was so\nstrong that he had to pull back before he'd crossed even half the distance. He stumbled away, joining\nBeldre and Sazed, gasping quietly, blinking tears. His heightened senses made it even more difficult for\nhim to approach the flames.\n\"There is nothing we can do here,\" Sazed said. \"We must gather crews and come back.\"\n\"I've failed,\" Spook whispered.\n\"No more than any of us,\" Sazed said. \"This is my fault. The emperor put me in command.\"\n\"We were supposed to bring security to the city,\" Spook said. \"Not destruction. I should be able to\nstop those fires. But, it hurts too much.\"\nSazed shook his head. \"Ah, Lord Spook. You are no god, to command fire at your whim. You are a\nman, like the rest of us. We're all just . . . men.\"\nSpook allowed them to pull him away. Sazed was right, of course. He was just a man. Just Spook.\nKelsier had chosen his crew with care. He'd left a note for them, when he died. It had listed the\nothers—Vin, Breeze, Dockson, Clubs, and Ham. He'd spoken of them, of why he'd picked them.\nBut not Spook. The only one who didn't fit in.\nI named you, Spook. You were my friend.\nIsn't that enough?\nSpook froze, forcing the others to stop. Sazed and Beldre looked at him. Spook stared into the night.\nA night that was far too bright. The fires burned.

He\npulled himself free of Sazed's grip and ran back toward the burning building.\n\"Spook!\" Two voices yelled in the night.\nSpook approached the flames. His breathing grew forced, and his skin grew hot. The fire was\nbright—consuming. He dashed right for it. Then, at the moment when the pain became too great, he\nextinguished his tin.\nAnd became numb.\nIt happened just as it had before, when he had been trapped in the building without any metals. Flaring\ntin for so long had expanded his senses, but now that he wasn't burning it at all, those same senses\nbecame dull. His entire body grew deadened, lacking feeling or sensation.\nHe burst through the doorway into the building, flames raining around him.\nHis body burned. But, he couldn't feel the flames, and the pain could not drive him back. The fire was\nbright enough that even his weakened eyes could still see. He dashed forward, ignoring fire, heat, and\nsmoke.\nSurvivor of the Flames.\nHe knew the fires were killing him. Yet, he forced himself onward, continuing to move long after the\npain should have rendered him unconscious. He reached the room at the back, skidding and sliding down\nthe broken ladder.\nThe cavern was dark. He stumbled through it, pushing his way past shelves and furniture, making his\nway along the wall, moving with a desperation that warned him that his time was short. His body wasn't\nworking right anymore—he had pushed it too far, and he no longer had pewter.\nHe was glad for the darkness. As he finally stumbled against Sazed's machine, he knew that he would\nhave been horrified to see what the flames had done to his arms.\nGroaning quietly, he felt for and found the lever—or, through numb hands, what he hoped was the\nlever. His fingers no longer worked. So, he simply threw his weight against it, moving the gears as\nrequired.\nThen he slid down to the ground, feeling only cold and dark.\nPART FIVE\nTRUST\nI do not know what went on in the minds of the koloss—what memories they retained, what\nhuman emotions they truly still knew.

Those buildings that hadn't burned down were either\nabandoned or overcrowded—an odd mixture, in TenSoon's opinion. Apparently, noble homes were\navoided, while skaa buildings were overpacked.\nMore remarkable, however, were the canals. They had been refilled somehow. TenSoon sat on his\nhaunches, watching the occasional makeshift boat push its way through a canal, displacing the patina of\nash that covered the water. Here and there, debris and refuse clogged the waterways, but they were\npassable in most places.\nHe rose, shaking his canine head, continuing on his way. He'd stowed the bag with Kelsier's bones\noutside, not wanting to look odd carrying a pack on his back.\nWhat had been the purpose of burning the city, then restoring its canals? He would likely have to wait\nto find the answer. He'd seen no army camped outside; if Vin had been here, she'd already moved on to\nanother location. His goal now was to find what passed for leadership in the remains of the city, then\ncontinue on his way, hunting down the Hero of Ages.\nAs he walked, he heard the people talking—speaking of how they'd managed to survive the fires that\nhad claimed much of the city. They actually seemed cheerful. There was despair, too, but there seemed\nan inordinate amount of happiness. This was not a city whose people had been conquered.\nThey feel they defeated the fire, TenSoon thought, making his way along a more crowded street.\nThey don't see losing a third of the city as a disaster—they see saving two-thirds of it as a miracle.\nHe followed the flow of traffic toward the center of town, where he finally found the soldiers he'd\nexpected. They were definitely Elend's, bearing the spear and the scroll on the arms of their uniforms.\nHowever, they defended an unlikely location: a Ministry building.\nTenSoon sat back on his haunches, cocking his head. The building was obviously a center of\noperations. People bustled about under the eyes of the watchful soldiers, moving in and out. If he wanted\nanswers, he'd need to get inside. He briefly considered going to fetch Kelsier's bones from outside the\ncity. However, he discarded that thought. He wasn't certain if he wanted to deal with the ramifications of\nmaking the Survivor appear again. There was another way to get in—equally shocking, perhaps, but far\nless theologically disturbing.\nHe padded over to the front of the building and walked up the steps, drawing a few startled looks. As\nhe approached the front doors, one of the guards shouted at him, waving the butt of a spear his direction.\n\"Here now!\" the man said. \"This is no place for dogs. Whose hound is this?\"\nTenSoon sat back on his haunches. \"I belong to no man,\" he said.\nThe guard jumped back in shock, and TenSoon got a twisted sense of pleasure. He immediately\nchided himself. The world was ending, and he went about startling random soldiers. Still, it was an\nadvantage of wearing a dog's body that he'd never considered. . . .\n\"Wha . . .\" the soldier said, looking around to see if he were the victim of some joke."

I am my own master.\"\nIt was a strange concept—the weight of which, undoubtedly, the guard could never grasp. TenSoon, a\nkandra, was outside of the Homeland without a Contract. As far as he knew, he was the first of his\npeople to do such a thing in seven hundred years. It felt oddly . . . satisfying.\nSeveral people were staring at him now. Other guards had approached, looking to their comrade for\nan explanation.\nTenSoon gambled. \"I've come from Emperor Venture,\" he said. \"I bear a message for your leaders\nhere.\"\nTo TenSoon's satisfaction, several of the other guards jumped. The first one, however—now an old\nhand when it came to talking dogs—raised a hesitant finger, pointing into the building. \"In there.\"\n\"Thank you,\" TenSoon said, rising and walking through a now-quiet crowd as he made his way into\nthe Ministry offices. He heard comments about \"trick\" and \"well-trained\" behind him, and noticed several\nguards running past him, faces urgent. He wound his way through groups and lines of people, all ignorant\nof the odd occurrence at the entrance to the building. At the end of the lines, TenSoon found . . .\nBreeze. The Soother sat in a throne-like chair, holding a cup of wine, looking very pleased with himself\nas he made proclamations and settled disputes. He looked much as he had when TenSoon had served as\nVin's servant. One of the guards stood whispering to Breeze. Both eyed TenSoon as he padded up to\nthe front of the line. The guard paled slightly, but Breeze just leaned forward, smiling.\n\"So,\" he said, tapping his cane lightly against the marble floor. \"Were you always a kandra, or did you\neat the bones of Vin's hound recently?\"\nTenSoon sat. \"I was always a kandra.\"\nBreeze nodded. \"I knew there was something odd about you—far too well behaved for a wolfhound.\"\nHe smiled, sipping his wine. \"Lord Renoux, I presume? It's been a while.\"\n\"I'm not him, actually,\" TenSoon said. \"I'm a different kandra. It's . . . complicated.\"\nThat gave Breeze pause. He eyed TenSoon, and TenSoon felt just a moment of panic. Breeze was a\nSoother—and, like all Soothers, he held the power to take control of TenSoon's body. The Secret.\nNo, TenSoon told himself forcefully. Allomancers are weaker now than they once were. Only with\nduralumin could they take control of a kandra, and Breeze is only a Misting—he can't burn\nduralumin.\n\"Drinking on the job, Breeze?\" TenSoon asked, raising a canine eyebrow.\n\"Of course,\" Breeze said, raising the cup. \"What good is being in charge if you can't set your own\nworking conditions?\"\nTenSoon snorted. He hadn't ever really liked Breeze—though perhaps that came from his bias against\nSoothers. Or, perhaps, his bias against all humans. Regardless, he wasn't inclined toward small talk."

Regardless, he wasn't inclined toward small talk.\n\"Where is Vin?\" he asked.\nBreeze frowned. \"I thought you brought a message from her?\"\n\"I lied to the guards,\" TenSoon said. \"I've actually come searching for her. I bring news she needs to\nhear—news regarding the mists and ash.\"\n\"Well, then, my dear man . . . um . . . I suppose I mean my dear doggie. Anyway, let us retire; you\ncan talk to Sazed. He's far more useful than I am regarding these sorts of things.\"\n\". . . and, with Spook barely having survived the ordeal,\" said the Terrisman, \"I thought it best to let Lord\nBreeze take command. We set up shop in a different Ministry building—it seemed equipped to be a\nbureaucratic center—and had Breeze start listening to petitions. He is better at dealing with people than I\nam, I think, and seems to enjoy taking care of the day-to-day concerns of the citizenry.\"\nThe Terrisman sat in his chair, a portfolio open on the desk before him, a pile of notes beside it. Sazed\nlooked different to TenSoon for some reason that he couldn't pin down. The Keeper wore the same\nrobes, and had the same Feruchemical bracers on his arms. There was something missing, however.\nThat, however, was the least of TenSoon's problems.\n\"Fadrex City?\" TenSoon asked, sitting on his own chair. They were in one of the smaller rooms at the\nMinistry building—one that had once been an obligator's sleeping quarters. Now, it simply held a desk\nand chairs, the walls and floor as austere as one might expect for Ministry furnishings.\nSazed nodded. \"She and the emperor hoped to find another of these storage caverns there.\"\nTenSoon slumped. Fadrex was halfway across the empire. Even with the Blessing of Potency, it would\ntake weeks for him to get there. He had a very, very long run ahead of him.\n\"Might I ask what business you have with Lady Vin, kandra?\" Sazed asked.\nTenSoon paused. It felt very odd, in a way, to speak so openly with Breeze, and now Sazed. These\nwere men that TenSoon had watched for months while he acted like a dog. They'd never known him, yet\nhe felt as if he knew them.\nHe knew, for instance, that Sazed was dangerous. The Terrisman was a Keeper—a group that\nTenSoon and his brethren had been trained to avoid. Keepers were always prying for rumors, legends,\nand tales. The kandra had many secrets; if the Keepers were ever to discover the riches of kandra\nculture, it could be disastrous. They'd want to study, ask questions, and record what they found.\nTenSoon opened his mouth to say \"Nothing.\" However, he stopped. Didn't he want someone to help\nwith kandra culture? Someone who focused on religions, and who—perhaps—knew much of theology?\nSomeone who knew about the legends of the Hero of Ages? Of all the members of the crew other than\nVin, TenSoon had held Sazed in the highest regard."

I shall give you whatever provisions you need. Will you be\nstarting out immediately? Or, will you be staying here to rest for a time?\"\nWhat? TenSoon thought. Sazed hadn't even twitched at the mention of religious matters. It didn't seem\nlike him at all.\nYet, Sazed continued speaking, as if TenSoon hadn't just hinted at one of the greatest religious secrets\nof their age.\nI'll never understand humans, he thought, shaking his head.\nThe prison Preservation created for Ruin was not created out of Preservation's power, though it\nwas of Preservation. Rather, Preservation sacrificed his consciousness—one could say his\nmind—to fabricate that prison. He left a shadow of himself, but Ruin, once escaped, began to\nsuffocate and isolate this small remnant vestige of his rival. I wonder if Ruin ever thought it\nstrange that Preservation had cut himself off from his own power, relinquishing it and leaving it\nin the world, to be gathered and used by men.\nIn Preservation's gambit, I see nobility, cleverness, and desperation. He knew that he could not\ndefeat Ruin. He had given too much of himself and, beyond that, he was the embodiment of stasis\nand stability. He could not destroy, not even to protect. It was against his nature. Hence the\nprison.\nMankind, however, had been created by both Ruin and Preservation—with a hint of\nPreservation's own soul to give them sentience and honor. In order for the world to survive,\nPreservation knew he had to depend upon his creations. To give them his trust.\nI wonder what he thought when those creations repeatedly failed him.\n60\nTHE BEST WAY TO FOOL SOMEONE, in Vin's estimation, was to give them what they wanted.\nOr, at the very least, what they expected. As long as they assumed that they were one step ahead, they\nwouldn't look back to see if there were any steps that they'd completely missed.\nYomen had designed her prison well. Any metal used in the construction of her cot or facilities was\nAllomantically useless. Silver, while expensive, seemed the metal of choice—and there was very little\neven of that. Just a few screws in the cot that Vin managed to work free with her fingernails.\nHer meals—a greasy, flavorless gruel—were served in wooden bowls, with wooden spoons. The\nguards were hazekillers: men who carried staves and wore no metal on their bodies, and who had been\ntrained to fight Allomancers. Her room was a simple stone construction with a solid wooden door, its\nhinges and bolts made of silver.\nShe knew from her guards' behavior that they expected something from her. Yomen had prepared\nthem well, and so when they slid her food through the slit, she could see the tension in their bodies and\nthe speed of their retreat. It was like they were feeding a viper.\nSo, the next time they came to take her to Yomen, she attacked."

        "text": "the speed of their retreat. It was like they were feeding a viper.\nSo, the next time they came to take her to Yomen, she attacked.\nShe moved as soon as the door opened, wielding a wooden leg she'd pulled off her cot. She dropped\nthe first guard with a club to the arm, then a second hit on the back of his head. Her blows felt weak\nwithout pewter, but it was the best she could manage. She scrambled past the second guard in line, then\nslammed her shoulder into the stomach of the third. She didn't weigh much, but it was enough to get him\nto drop his staff—which she immediately grabbed.\nHam had spent a long time training her with the staff, and he'd often made her fight without Allomancy.\nEven with all of their preparation, the guards were obviously surprised to see a metalless Allomancer\nmake so much trouble, and she dropped two more of them as she scurried to escape.\nUnfortunately, Yomen was not a fool. He had sent so many guards to bring her that even dropping\nfour of them made little difference. There had to be at least twenty men in the hallway outside her cell,\nclogging her exit, if nothing else.\nHer goal was to give them what they expected, not get herself killed. So, as soon as she confirmed\nthat her \"escape attempt\" really was doomed, she let one of the soldiers hit her on the shoulder and she\ndropped her staff with a grunt. Disarmed, she raised her hands and backed away. The soldiers, of\ncourse, swept her feet out from beneath her and piled on top of her, holding her down while one\nmanacled her arms.\nVin suffered the treatment, shoulder pulsing with pain. How long would she have to go without metal\nbefore she'd stop instinctively trying to burn pewter? She hoped she'd never actually find out.\nEventually, the soldiers pulled her to her feet and pushed her down the hallway. The three she'd\nknocked down—not to mention the one that she'd disarmed—grumbled a bit, rubbing their wounds. All\ntwenty men regarded her even more warily, if that was possible.\nShe didn't give them any trouble until they got her into Yomen's audience chamber. When they moved\nto chain her manacles to the bench, she squirmed a bit, earning herself a knee in the stomach. She\ngasped, then slumped to the floor beside the bench. There, groaning, she rubbed her hands and wrists\nwith the gruel grease that she'd soaked into her undershirt. It was smelly and grimy, but it was very\nslick—and the guards, distracted by her escape attempt, had completely forgotten to search her.\n\"Surely you didn't think to escape without any metals to burn,\" Yomen asked.\nVin lifted her head. He stood with his back to her again, though this time he was looking out a dark\nwindow. Vin found it very odd to see the mists curling up against the window glass. Most skaa couldn't\nafford glass, and most noblemen chose the colored kind. The darkness outside of Yomen's window\nseemed a waiting beast, the mists its fur brushing against the glass as it shifted.\n\"I would think that you'd be flattered,\" Yomen continued. \"I didn't know if you were really as\ndangerous as reported, but I decided to assume that you were.

You see, I—\"\nVin didn't give him any more time. There were only two ways she could escape from the city: the first\nwould be to find some metals, the second would be to take Yomen captive. She planned to try both.\nShe yanked her greased hands free from the manacles, which had been fastened to her arms when\nthey were squirming and flexed. She ignored the pain and the blood as the manacles scraped her hands,\nthen she leaped to her feet, reaching into a fold in her shirt and pulling out the silver screws that she'd\ntaken from her cot. These, she threw at the soldiers.\nThe men, of course, yelled in surprise and threw themselves to the ground, ducking her presumed\nSteelpush. Their own preparation and worry worked against them—for Vin had no steel. The screws\nbounced against the wall ineffectively, and the guards lay confused by her feint. She was halfway to\nYomen before the first one thought to scramble back to his feet.\nYomen turned. As always, he wore the little drop of atium at his forehead. Vin lunged for it.\nYomen stepped casually out of the way. Vin lunged again, this time feinting, then trying to elbow him in\nthe stomach. Her attack didn't land, however, as Yomen—hands still clasped behind his\nback—sidestepped her again.\nShe knew that look on his face—that look of complete control, of power. Yomen obviously had very\nlittle battle training, but he dodged her anyway.\nHe was burning atium.\nVin stumbled to a halt. No wonder he wears that bit on his forehead, she thought. It's for\nemergencies. She could see in his smile that he really had anticipated her. He'd known that she would\ntry something, and he'd baited her, letting her get close. But, he'd never really been in danger.\nThe guards finally caught up with her, but Yomen raised a hand, waving them back. Then he gestured\ntoward the bench. Quietly, Vin returned and sat down. She had to think, and she certainly wasn't going\nto get anywhere with Yomen burning atium.\nAs she sat, Ruin appeared next to her—materializing as if from dark smoke, wearing Reen's body.\nNone of the others reacted; they obviously couldn't see him.\n\"Too bad,\" Ruin said. \"In a way, you almost had him. But . . . then, in a way, you were never really\nclose, either.\"\nShe ignored Ruin, looking up at Yomen. \"You're Mistborn.\"\n\"No,\" he said, shaking his head. He didn't turn back toward his window, however. He stood facing\nher, wary. He'd probably turned off his atium—it was far too valuable to leave burning—but he'd have it\nin reserve, careful to watch her for signs of another attack.\n\"No?\" Vin said, raising a skeptical eyebrow. \"You were burning atium, Yomen. I saw that much.\"\n\"Believe as you wish,\" Yomen said. \"But know this, woman: I do not lie. I've never needed lies, and I"

People need truth from those they\nfollow.\"\nVin frowned.\n\"Regardless, it is time,\" Yomen said.\n\"Time?\" Vin asked.\nYomen nodded. \"Yes. I apologize for leaving you for so long in your cell. I have been . . . distracted.\"\nElend, Vin thought. What has he been doing? I feel so blind!\nShe glanced at Ruin, who stood on the other side of the bench, shaking his head as if he understood\nfar more than he was telling her. She turned back to Yomen. \"I still don't understand,\" she said. \"Time for\nwhat?\"\nYomen met her eyes. \"Time for me to make a decision about your execution, Lady Venture.\"\nOh, she thought. Right. Between her dealings with Ruin and her plans to escape, she'd nearly\nforgotten Yomen's declaration that he intended to let her \"defend\" herself before he executed her.\nRuin walked across the room, circling Yomen in a leisurely stroll. The obligator king stood, still\nmeeting Vin's eyes. If he could see Ruin, he didn't show it. Instead, he waved to a guard, who opened a\nside door, leading in several obligators in gray robes. They seated themselves on a bench across the\nroom from Vin.\n\"Tell me, Lady Venture,\" Yomen said, turning back to her, \"why did you come to Fadrex City?\"\nVin cocked her head. \"I thought this wasn't to be a trial. You said that you didn't need that sort of\nthing.\"\n\"I would think,\" Yomen replied, \"that you would be pleased with any delay in the process.\"\nA delay meant more time to think—more time to possibly escape. \"Why did we come?\" Vin asked.\n\"We knew you had one of the Lord Ruler's supply caches beneath your city.\"\nYomen raised an eyebrow. \"How did you know about it?\"\n\"We found another one,\" Vin said. \"It had directions to Fadrex.\"\nYomen nodded to himself. She could tell that he believed her, but there was something . . . else. He\nseemed to be making connections that she didn't understand, and probably didn't have the information to\nunderstand. \"And the danger my kingdom posed to yours?\" Yomen asked. \"That didn't have anything at\nall to do with your invasion of my lands?\"\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" Vin said. \"Cett had been pushing Elend to move into this dominance for some\ntime.\"\nThe obligators conferred quietly at this comment, though Yomen stood aloof, arms folded as he\nregarded her. Vin found the experience unnerving. It had been years—from her days in Camon's\ncrew—since she had felt so much in another's power. Even when she'd faced the Lord Ruler, she'd felt\ndifferently. Yomen seemed to see her as a tool.\nBut a tool to do what? And, how could she manipulate his needs so that he kept her alive long enough\nfor her to escape?\nMake yourself indispensable, Reen had always taught. Then a crewleader can't get rid of you"

Even now, the voice of her brother still seemed to whisper the words in\nher mind. Were they memories, interpretations of his wisdom, or effects of Ruin's influence? Regardless,\nit seemed like good advice at the moment.\n\"So, you came with the express purpose of invasion?\" Yomen asked.\n\"Elend intended to try diplomacy first,\" Vin said carefully. \"However, we both knew that it's a bit hard\nto play the diplomat when you camp an army outside of someone's city.\"\n\"You admit to being conquerors, then,\" Yomen said. \"You are more honest than your husband.\"\n\"Elend is more sincere than either of us, Yomen,\" Vin snapped. \"Just because he interprets things\ndifferently from you or me does not mean he's being dishonest when he expresses his view.\"\nYomen raised an eyebrow, perhaps at the quickness of her response. \"A valid point.\"\nVin sat back on the bench, wrapping her cut hands with a bit of clean cloth from her shirt. Yomen\nstood beside the windows of the large, stark room. It felt very odd to be speaking to him. On one hand,\nshe and he seemed very different. He was a bureaucrat obligator whose lack of muscle or warrior's grace\nproved that he'd spent his life concerned with forms and records. She was a child of the streets and an\nadult practiced in war and assassination.\nYet, his mannerisms, his way of speaking, seemed to resemble her own. Is this what I might have\nbeen more like, she wondered, had I not been born a skaa? A blunt bureaucrat rather than a terse\nwarrior?\nAs Yomen contemplated her, Ruin walked in a slow circle around the obligator king. \"This one is a\ndisappointment,\" Ruin said quietly.\nVin glanced at Ruin just briefly. He shook his head. \"Such destruction this one could have caused, had\nhe struck out, rather than staying huddled in his little city, praying to his dead god. Men would have\nfollowed him. I could never get through to him on the long term, unfortunately. Not every ploy can be\nsuccessful, particularly when the will of fools like him must be accounted for.\"\n\"So,\" Yomen said, drawing her attention back to him, \"you came to take my city because you heard of\nmy stockpile, and because you feared a return of the Lord Ruler's power.\"\n\"I didn't say that,\" Vin said, frowning.\n\"You said that you feared me.\"\n\"As a foreign power,\" Vin said, \"with a proven ability to undermine a government and take it over.\"\n\"I didn't take over,\" Yomen said. \"I returned this city, and the dominance, to its rightful rule. But that is\nbeside the point. I want you to tell me of this religion your people preach.\"\n\"The Church of the Survivor?\"\n\"Yes,\" Yomen said. \"You are one of its heads, correct?\"\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"They revere me. But I've never felt that I properly fit as part of the religion. Mostly,\nit's focused around Kelsier.\"\n\"The Survivor of Hathsin,\" Yomen said. \"He died. How is it that people worship him?\"\nVin shrugged. \"It used to be common to worship gods that one couldn't see.\""

How is it that people worship him?\"\nVin shrugged. \"It used to be common to worship gods that one couldn't see.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Yomen said. \"I have . . . read of such things, though I find them difficult to understand.\nFaith in an unseen god—what sense does that make? Why reject the god that they lived with for so\nlong—the one that they could see, and feel—in favor of one that died? One that the Lord Ruler himself\nstruck down?\"\n\"You do it,\" Vin said. \"You're still worshipping the Lord Ruler.\"\n\"He's not gone,\" Yomen said.\nVin paused.\n\"No,\" Yomen said, apparently noting her confusion. \"I haven't seen or heard of him since his\ndisappearance. However, neither do I put any credence in reports of his death.\"\n\"He was rather dead,\" Vin said. \"Trust me.\"\n\"I don't trust you, I'm afraid,\" Yomen said. \"Tell me of that evening. Tell me precisely what happened.\"\nSo Vin did. She told him of her imprisonment, and of her escape with Sazed. She told him of her\ndecision to fight the Lord Ruler, and of her reliance on the Eleventh Metal. She left out her strange ability\nto draw upon the power of the mists, but she explained pretty much everything else—including Sazed's\ntheory that the Lord Ruler had been immortal through the clever manipulation of his Feruchemy and\nAllomancy in combination.\nAnd Yomen actually listened. Her respect for the man increased as she spoke, and as he didn't\ninterrupt her. He wanted to hear her story, even if he didn't believe it. He was a man who accepted\ninformation for what it was—another tool to be used, yet to be trusted no more than any other tool.\n\"And so,\" Vin finished, \"he is dead. I stabbed him through the heart myself. Your faith in him is\nadmirable, but it can't change what happened.\"\nYomen stood silently. The older obligators—who still sat on their benches—had grown white in the\nface. She knew that her testimony might have damned her, but for some reason she felt that\nhonesty—plain, blunt honesty—would serve her better than guile. That's how she usually felt.\nAn odd conviction for one who grew up in thieving crews, she thought. Ruin had apparently grown\nbored during her account, and had walked over to look out the window.\n\"What I need to find out,\" Yomen finally said, \"is why the Lord Ruler thought it necessary for you to\nthink that you had killed him.\"\n\"Didn't you listen to what just I said?\" Vin demanded.\n\"I did,\" Yomen said calmly. \"And do not forget that you are a prisoner here—one who is very close to\ndeath.\"\nVin forced herself to be quiet.\n\"You find my words ridiculous?\" Yomen said. \"More ridiculous than your own? Think of how I see\nyou, claiming to have slain a man I know to be God. Is it not plausible that he wanted this to happen?\nThat he's out there, still, watching us, waiting . . .\"\nThat's what this is all about, she realized.

All of those happy skaa? Looking\ntoward you for hope?\"\n\"The Lord Ruler must be behind all of this,\" Yomen mused out loud. \"That means that he wanted the\nworld to see you as his killer. He wanted the skaa to worship you.\"\n\"Why?\" Ruin repeated. \"Why be so uncomfortable? Is it because you know you can't offer them\nhope? What is it they call him, the one you are supposed to have replaced? The Survivor? A word of\nPreservation, I think. . . .\"\n\"Perhaps he intends to return dramatically,\" Yomen said. \"To depose you and topple you, to prove\nthat faith in him is the only true faith.\"\nWhy don't you fit?

Trying to stop\nthe guilt.\nYomen paused.\n\"They're wrong about me,\" Vin said. \"They don't worship me, they worship what they think I should\nbe. But I'm not the Heir of the Survivor. I didn't do what Kelsier did. He freed them.\"\nYou conquered them, Ruin whispered.\n\"Yes,\" Vin said, looking up. \"You're looking in the wrong direction, Yomen. The Lord Ruler won't\nreturn.\"\n\"I told you that—\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, standing. \"No, he's not coming back. He doesn't need to. I took his place.\"\nElend had worried that he was becoming another Lord Ruler, but his concern had always seemed\nflawed to Vin. He hadn't been the one to conquer and reforge an empire, she had. She'd been the one\nwho made the other kings submit.\nShe'd done exactly as the Lord Ruler had. A Hero had risen up, and the Lord Ruler had killed him,\nthen taken the power of the Well of Ascension. Vin had killed the Lord Ruler, then taken that same\npower. She'd given up the power, true, but she'd filled the same role.\nIt all came to a head. The reason why the skaa worshipping her, calling her their savior, felt so wrong.\nSuddenly, her real role in it all seemed to snap into place.\n\"I'm not the Survivor's Heir, Yomen,\" she said sickly. \"I'm the Lord Ruler's.\"\nHe shook his head dismissively.\n\"When you first captured me,\" she said, \"I wondered why you kept me alive.

His steps suddenly became more fluid—he didn't have the grace of pewter or the\nknowledge of a warrior, but he moved just right. She dodged instinctively, but his atium let him anticipate\nher, and before she could so much as think, he'd thrown her to the floor, holding her pinned with a knee\nagainst her back.\n\"I may not kill you yet,\" he said calmly, \"but that hardly means that you're in 'no danger,' Lady\nVenture.\"\nVin grunted.\n\"I want something from you,\" he said. \"Something more than what we've discussed. I want you to tell\nyour husband to send his army away.\"\n\"Why would I do that?\" Vin said, face pressed against the cold stone of the floor.\n\"Because,\" Yomen said, \"you claim to want my storage cache, yet you claim to be good people. You\nnow know that I will use the food in it wisely, to feed my people. If your Elend really is as altruistic as\nyou claim, he certainly won't be so selfish as to throw away lives to war, just so you can steal away our\nfood and use it to feed your own.\"\n\"We can grow crops,\" Vin said. \"We get enough light in the Central Dominance, while you don't.

There is something to the whole group that can save us.\"\nYomen snorted. \"You were down there all that time, and you didn't read the plaque that the Lord\nRuler left?\"\n\"Of course I did.\"\n\"Then you know that there is nothing more in those caches,\" Yomen said. \"They're all part of his plan,\ntrue.

The real reason itched inside of Vin. Elend had always found it an\nunimportant one, but to her, it held powerful appeal. \"You know full well why we have to take the city,\"\nVin said. \"As long as you have it, we have reason to conquer you.\"\n\"It?\" Yomen asked.\nRuin stepped forward, curious.\n\"You know what I mean. The atium. The Lord Ruler's supply.\"\n\"That?\" Yomen asked, laughing. \"This is all about the atium? Atium is worthless!\"\nVin frowned. \"Worthless? It's the single most valuable commodity in the Final Empire!\"\n\"Oh?\" Yomen asked. \"And how many people are there around to burn it? How many noble houses\nremain to play petty politics and vie for power by showing how much atium they can leach from the Lord\nRuler? The value of atium was based in the economy of an empire, Lady Venture. Without the trappings\nof a reserve system and an upper class giving the metal implied worth, atium has no real value.\" Yomen\nshook his head. \"To a starving man, what is more important—a loaf of bread, or an entire jar of atium he\ncan't use, eat, or sell?\"\nHe waved for the guards to take her. They pulled her to her feet, and she struggled, holding Yomen's\neyes.\nYomen turned away from her again. \"Those lumps of metal do me no good, save—perhaps—to keep\nyou in check. No, the food was the real resource. The Lord Ruler left me the riches I required to\nestablish his power again. I just need to figure out what he wants me to do next.\"\nThe soldiers finally succeeded in pulling her away.\nI don't wonder that we focused far too much on the mists during those days. But from what I now\nknow of sunlight and plant development, I realize that our crops weren't in as much danger from\nmisty days as we feared. We might very well have been able to find plants to eat that did not need\nas much light to survive.\nTrue, the mists did also cause some deaths in those who went out in them, but the number killed\nwas not a large enough percentage of the population to be a threat to our survival as a species.\nThe ash, that was our real problem. The smoke filling the atmosphere, the black flakes covering\nup everything beneath, the eruptions of the volcanic ashmounts . . . Those were what would kill\nthe world.\n61\n\"ELEND!\" HAM CALLED, rushing up to him. \"You're back!\"\n\"Surprised?\" Elend asked, reading his friend's expression.\n\"Of course not,\" Ham said, a little too quickly. \"The scouts reported your approach.\"\nMy arrival may not surprise you, Elend thought tiredly, but the fact that I'm still alive does.

There was so much ash. . . .\nI can't worry about everything at once, Elend thought with determination. I just have to trust.\nTrust in myself and keep going.\nHe had pondered the mist spirit the rest of his trip. Had it really told him not to attack Fadrex, or was\nElend simply misinterpreting its gestures? What had it wanted him to learn by pointing at his vial of\nmetals?\nBeside him, Ham was regarding the mass of new koloss. To the side of the army, his other koloss\nsat—still under his control. Though he had grown increasingly adept at keeping a hold on the creatures, it\nwas still nice to be back close to them. It made him feel more comfortable.\nHam whistled quietly. \"Twenty-eight thousand?\" he asked. \"Or, at least, that's what the scouts say.\"\nElend nodded.\n\"I hadn't realized how large the group was,\" Ham said. \"With that many . . .\"\nThirty-seven thousand total, Elend thought. More than enough to storm Fadrex.\nHe began to walk down the incline, toward the camp. Though he hadn't needed much pewter to help\nhim through the hike, he was still tired. \"Any news of Vin?\" he said hopefully, though he knew that if she'd\nmanaged to escape, she would have already found him.\n\"We sent a messenger into the city while you were gone,\" Ham said as they began to walk. \"Yomen\nsaid a soldier could come and confirm that Vin was still alive, and so we complied in your name, thinking\nit best if Yomen thought you were here.\"\n\"You did well,\" Elend said.\n\"It's been a while since then,\" Ham said. \"We haven't heard anything of her since.\"\n\"She's still alive,\" Elend said.\nHam nodded. \"I believe so too.\"\nElend smiled. \"It's not just faith, Ham,\" he said, nodding toward the koloss that had remained behind.\n\"Before she was captured, I gave some of those to her. If she'd died, then they would have gone out of\ncontrol. As long as she lives—whether or not she has metals—she will remain bonded to them.\"\nHam paused. \"That . . . would have been something good to tell us earlier, El.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said. \"It's too easy to forget how many I'm controlling—I didn't even think that not all\nof those are mine. Post scouts, keep an eye on them. I'll take them back if they go wild.\"\nHam nodded. \"Could you contact her through them?\"\nElend shook his head. How did he explain? Controlling the koloss wasn't a subtle thing—their minds\nwere too dull for much beyond simple commands. He could order them to attack, or to freeze, or to\nfollow and carry things. But he couldn't direct them precisely, couldn't instruct them to speak a message\nor even how to accomplish a goal. He could only say \"Do this\" and watch them go."

But Ham wasn't done.\n\"There are tales of cities swallowed by the rumbling earth,\" Ham said, voice almost a whisper. \"King\nLekal and his city fell to lava from one of the ashmounts. We haven't heard from Janarle in weeks; his\nentire retinue seems to have vanished, and the Northern Dominance is in chaos. The entire Southern\nDominance is said to be burning. . . .

He didn't know how to answer Ham's\nquestion. What did he do? What could he do?\n\"We'll help them, Ham,\" he said. \"We won't give up.\"\nHam nodded, looking slightly bolstered. \"Though, before you do anything else, what you should\nprobably do is go change your clothing. . . .\"\nElend glanced down, remembering that he was still wearing the black uniform, bloodied from killing\nkoloss, then stained by ash. His appearance caused quite a stir in the men. They've only seen me in the\nwhite, pristine outfit. Many of them have never even seen me fight—never seen me bloodied,\nnever seen me dirtied by ash.\nHe wasn't certain what bothered him about that.\nAhead, Elend could see a bearded figure sitting in a chair beside the pathway, as if he were simply out\nthere for an afternoon repast. Cett eyed him as he passed. \"More koloss?\"\nElend nodded.\n\"We're going to attack, then?\" Cett asked.\nElend stopped.\nThe mist spirit apparently didn't want him to attack. But, he couldn't be certain what it had wanted him\nto know or think—he didn't even know if he should trust it. Could he base the future of his empire on\nvague impressions he got from a ghost in the mists?\nHe had to get into that storage, and he couldn't afford to wait in siege—not any longer. Plus, attacking\nseemed the best way to get Vin back safely. Yomen would never return her—Elend either had to sit\naround and wait, or he had to attack, hoping that in the chaos of battle, Yomen would leave her in a\ndungeon somewhere.

Spook lay in his bed, still swaddled in\nbandages. The boy had not awakened since his ordeal, and Sazed wasn't certain if he ever would. Even\nif he did live, he'd be horribly scarred for the rest of his life.\nThough, Sazed thought, this proves one thing. The boy doesn't have pewter. If Spook had been\nable to burn pewter, then he would have healed far more quickly. Sazed had administered a vial of\npewter just in case, and it had made no difference. The boy hadn't mystically become a Thug.\nIt was comforting, in a way. It meant that Sazed's world still made sense.\nInside the room, the girl—Beldre—sat at Spook's side. She came every day to spend time with the\nlad. More time, even, than she spent with her brother, Quellion. The Citizen had a broken arm and some\nother wounds, but nothing lethal. Though Breeze ruled in Urteau, Quellion was still an authority, and he\nseemed to have grown far more . . . civil. He now seemed willing to consider an alliance with Elend.\nIt seemed strange to Sazed that Quellion would become so accommodating. They had entered his city,\nsown chaos, and nearly killed him. Now he listened to their offers of peace? Sazed was suspicious, to be\nsure. Time would tell.\nInside, Beldre turned slightly, finally noticing Sazed at the doorway. She smiled, standing.\n\"Please, Lady Beldre,\" he said, entering. \"Don't stand.\"\nShe seated herself again as Sazed walked forward. He surveyed his bandage work on Spook,\nchecking the young man's condition, comparing notes from inside the medical texts of his copperminds.\nBeldre watched quietly.\nOnce he was finished, he turned to leave.\n\"Thank you,\" Beldre said from behind.\nSazed stopped.\nShe glanced at Spook. \"Do you think . . .

That's what Spook wanted.\"\nHope . . . Sazed thought, studying the girl's eyes. She really does love him.\nIt seemed, in a way, silly to Sazed. How long had she known the boy? A few weeks? During that\nshort time, Spook had not only earned Beldre's love, but had become a hero to the people of an entire\ncity.\nShe sits and hopes, having faith that he will recover, Sazed thought. Yet, upon seeing him, the\nfirst thing I thought of was how relieved I was that he wasn't a Pewterarm. Had Sazed really\nbecome that callous? Just two years before, he had been willing to fall hopelessly in love with a woman\nwho had spent most of her life chastising him. A woman with whom he had only had a few precious days.\nHe turned and left the room.\nSazed walked to his quarters in the nobleman's mansion they had taken, their new home now that their\nformer residence was a burned-out ruin. It was nice to have ordinary walls and steps again, rather than\nendless shelves bounded by cavern walls.\nOn his desk sat the open portfolio, its cloth-wrapped coverboard stained with ash. One stack of\npages sat to its left, and one stack sat to its right. There were only ten pages left in the right stack.\nTaking a deep breath, Sazed approached and sat down. It was time to finish.\nIt was late morning the next day before he set the final sheet onto the top of the left stack. He'd moved\nquickly through these last ten, but he'd been able to give them his undivided attention, not being distracted\nby riding as he worked or other concerns. He felt that he'd given each one due consideration.\nHe sat for a time, feeling fatigued, and not just from lack of sleep. He felt . . . numb. His task was\ndone. After a year's work, he'd sifted through each and every religion in his stack. And he'd eliminated\nevery one.\nIt was odd, how many common features they all had. Most claimed ultimate authority, denouncing\nother faiths. Most taught of an afterlife, but could offer no proof. Most taught about a god or gods,\nyet—again—had little justification for their teachings. And every single one of them was riddled with\ninconsistencies and logical fallacies.\nHow did men believe in something that preached love on one hand, yet taught destruction of\nunbelievers on the other? How did one rationalize belief with no proof? How could they honestly expect\nhim to have faith in something that taught of miracles and wonders in the far past, but carefully gave"

How could they honestly expect\nhim to have faith in something that taught of miracles and wonders in the far past, but carefully gave\nexcuses for why such things didn't occur in the present day?\nAnd then, of course, there was the final flake of ash on the pile—the thing that each and every faith\nhad, in his opinion, failed to prove. All taught that believers would be blessed. And all had absolutely no\nanswer as to why their gods had allowed the faithful to be captured, imprisoned, enslaved, and\nslaughtered by a heretic known as Rashek, the Lord Ruler.\nThe stack of pages sat face down on the desk before him. They meant that there was no truth. No\nfaith that would bring Tindwyl back to him. Nothing watching over men, contrary to what Spook had\naffirmed so strongly. Sazed ran his fingers across the final page, and finally, the depression he'd been\nfighting—barely holding at bay for so long—was too strong for him to overcome. The portfolio had been\nhis final line of defense.\nIt was pain. That's what the loss felt like. Pain and numbness at the same time; a barb-covered wire\ntwisting around his chest combined with an absolute inability to do anything about it. He felt like huddling\nin a corner, crying, and just letting himself die.\nNo! he thought. There must be something. . . .\nHe reached under his desk, trembling fingers seeking his sack of metalminds. However, he didn't pull\none of these out, but instead removed a large, thick tome. He put it on the table beside his portfolio, then\nopened it to a random page. Words written in two different hands confronted him. One was careful and\nflowing. His own. The other was terse and determined. Tindwyl's.\nHe rested his fingers on the page. He and Tindwyl had compiled this book together, deciphering the\nhistory, prophecies, and meanings surrounding the Hero of Ages. Back before Sazed had stopped\ncaring.\nThat's a lie, he thought, forming a fist. Why do I lie to myself? I still care. I never stopped caring.\nIf I'd stopped caring, then I wouldn't still be searching. If I didn't care so much, then being\nbetrayed wouldn't feel so painful.\nKelsier had spoken of this. Then Vin had done the same. Sazed had never expected to have similar\nfeelings. Who was there that could hurt him so deeply that he felt betrayed? He was not like other men.\nHe acknowledged that not out of arrogance, but out of simple self-knowledge. He forgave people,\nperhaps to a fault. He simply wasn't the type to feel bitter.\nHe'd assumed, therefore, that he would never have to deal with these emotions. That's why he'd been\nso unprepared to be betrayed by the only thing he couldn't accept as being flawed.\nHe couldn't believe. If he believed, it meant that God—or the universe, or whatever it was that\nwatched over man—had failed. Better to believe that there was nothing at all. Then, all of the world's\ninadequacies were simply mere chance. Not caused by a god who had failed them."

Not caused by a god who had failed them.\nSazed glanced at his open tome, noticing a little slip of paper sticking out between its pages. He pulled\nit free, surprised to find the picture of a flower that Vin had given him, the one that Kelsier's wife had\ncarried. The one she'd used to give herself hope. To remind her of a world that had existed before the\ncoming of the Lord Ruler.\nHe glanced upward. The ceiling was of wood, but red sunlight—refracted by the window—sprayed\nacross it. \"Why?\" he whispered. \"Why leave me like this? I studied everything about you. I learned the\nreligions of five hundred different peoples and sects. I taught about you when other men had given up a\nthousand years before.\n\"Why leave me without hope, when others can have faith? Why leave me to wonder? Shouldn't I be\nmore certain than any other? Shouldn't my knowledge have protected me?\"\nAnd yet, his faith had made him even more susceptible. That's what trust is, Sazed thought. It's\nabout giving someone else power over you. Power to hurt you. That's why he'd given up his\nmetalminds. That's why he had decided to sort through the religions one at a time, trying to find one that\nhad no faults. Nothing to fail him.\nIt just made sense. Better to not believe, rather than be proven wrong. Sazed looked back down.\nWhy did he think to talk to the heavens? There was nothing there.\nThere never had been.\nOutside, in the hallway, he could hear voices. \"My dear doggie,\" Breeze said, \"surely you'll stay for\nanother day.\"\n\"No,\" said TenSoon the kandra, speaking in his growling voice. \"I must find Vin as soon as possible.\"\nEven the kandra, Sazed thought. Even an inhuman creature has more faith than I.\nAnd yet, how could they understand? Sazed closed his eyes tight, feeling a pair of tears squeeze from\nthe corners. How could anyone understand the pain of a faith betrayed? He had believed. And yet, when\nhe had needed hope the most, he had found only emptiness.\nHe picked up the book, then snapped closed his portfolio, locking the inadequate summaries inside.\nHe turned toward the hearth. Better to simply burn it all.\nBelief . . . He remembered a voice from the past. His own voice, speaking to Vin on that terrible day\nafter Kelsier's death. Belief isn't simply a thing for fair times and bright days, I think. What is\nbelief—what is faith—if you don't continue in it after failure. . . .\nHow innocent he had been.\nBetter to trust and be betrayed, Kelsier seemed to whisper. It had been one of the Survivor's\nmottos. Better to love and be hurt.\nSazed gripped the tome. It was such a meaningless thing. Its text could be changed by Ruin at any\ntime. And do I believe in that? Sazed thought with frustration. Do I have faith in this Ruin, but not in\nsomething better?\nHe stood quietly in the room, holding the book, listening to Breeze and Ten-Soon outside. The book"

Something real.\nSomething true. Please?\n\"Farewell, Soother,\" TenSoon said. \"Give my regards to the Announcer.\" Then, Sazed heard Breeze\nthump away. TenSoon padded down the hallway on his quieter dog's feet.\nAnnouncer. . . .\nSazed froze.\nThat word. . . .\nSazed stood, stunned for a moment. Then, he threw his door open and burst into the hallway. The\ndoor slammed back against the wall, making Breeze jump. TenSoon stopped at the end of the hallway,\nnear the stairs. He turned back, looking at Sazed.\n\"What did you call me?\" Sazed demanded.\n\"The Announcer,\" TenSoon said. \"You are, are you not, the one who pointed out Lady Vin as the\nHero of Ages? That, then, is your title.\"\nSazed fell to his knees, slapping his tome—the one he had written with Tindwyl—on the floor before\nhim. He flipped through the pages, locating one in particular, penned in his own hand. I thought myself\nthe Holy Witness, it said, the prophet foretold to discover the Hero of Ages. They were the words of\nKwaan, the man who had originally named Alendi the Hero. From these writings, which were their only\nclues about the original Terris religion, Sazed and the others had gleaned what little they knew of the\nprophecies about the Hero of Ages.\n\"What is this?\" Breeze asked, leaning down, scanning the words. \"Hum. Looks like you've got the\nwrong term, my dear doggie. Not 'Announcer' at all, but 'Holy Witness.' \"\nSazed looked up. \"This is one of the passages that Ruin changed, Breeze,\" he said quietly. \"When I\nwrote it, it read differently—but Ruin altered it, trying to trick me and Vin into fulfilling his prophecies.\nThe skaa had started to call me the Holy Witness, their own term. So Ruin retroactively changed\nKwaan's writings so that they seemed prophetic and reference me.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Breeze asked, rubbing his chin. \"What did it say before?\"\nSazed ignored the question, instead meeting TenSoon's canine eyes. \"How did you know?\" he\ndemanded. \"How do you know the words of the ancient Terris prophecies?\"\nTenSoon fell back on his haunches. \"It strikes me as odd, Terrisman. There's one great inconsistency\nin this all, a problem no one has ever thought to point out. What happened to the packmen who traveled\nwith Rashek and Alendi up to the Well of Ascension?\"\nRashek. The man who had become the Lord Ruler.\nBreeze stood up straight. \"That's easy, kandra,\" he said, waving his cane. \"Everyone knows that when\nthe Lord Ruler took the throne of Khlennium, he made his trusted friends into noblemen.

That's why the\nnobility of the Final Empire were so pampered—they were the descendants of Rashek's good friends.\"\nTenSoon sat quietly.\nNo, Sazed thought with wonder. No . . . that couldn't be! \"He couldn't have made those packmen\ninto nobles.\"\n\"Why ever not?\" Breeze asked.\n\"Because the nobility gained Allomancy,\" Sazed said, standing. \"Rashek's friends were Feruchemists.\nIf he'd made them into noblemen, then . . .\"\n\"Then they could have challenged him,\" TenSoon said. \"They could have become both Allomancers\nand Feruchemists as he was, and had his same powers.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sazed said. \"He spent ten centuries trying to breed Feruchemy out of the Terris population—all\nin fear that someday someone would be born with both Feruchemy and Allomancy! His friends who\nwent to the Well with him would have been dangerous, since they were obviously powerful Feruchemists,\nand they knew what Rashek had done to Alendi. Rashek would have had to do something else with\nthem. Something to sequester them, perhaps even kill them. . . .\"\n\"No,\" TenSoon said. \"He didn't kill them. You call the Father a monster, but he was not an evil man.\nHe didn't kill his friends, though he did recognize the threat their powers posed to him. So, he offered\nthem a bargain, speaking directly to their minds while he was holding the power of creation.\"\n\"What bargain?\" Breeze asked, obviously confused.\n\"Immortality,\" TenSoon said quietly. \"In exchange for their Feruchemy. They gave it up, along with\nsomething else.\"\nSazed stared at the creature in the hallway, a creature who thought like a man but had the form of a\nbeast. \"They gave up their humanity,\" Sazed whispered.\nTenSoon nodded.\n\"They live on?\" Sazed asked, stepping forward. \"The Lord Ruler's companions? The very Terrismen\nwho climbed to the Well with him?\"\n\"We call them the First Generation,\" TenSoon said. \"The founders of the kandra people. The Father\ntransformed every living Feruchemist into a mistwraith, beginning that race. His good friends, however, he\nreturned to sentience with a few Hemalurgic spikes.

Such a fool.\n\"What?\" Breeze asked, frowning. \"What's going on? Sazed? My dear man, why are you so flustered?\nWhat do this creature's words mean?\"\n\"They mean hope,\" Sazed said, pushing into his room, hurriedly throwing some of his clothing into a\ntravel pack.\n\"Hope?\" Breeze asked, peeking in.\nSazed looked back, toward where Breeze stood. The kandra had walked up, and stood behind him in\nthe hallway. \"The Terris religion, Breeze,\" Sazed said. \"The thing my sect was founded for, the thing my\npeople have spent lifetimes searching to discover.

The Terris faith is not dead!\"\nThere was one more religion to add to his list. His quest was not yet over.\n\"Quickly, Keeper,\" TenSoon said. \"I was prepared to go without you, since everyone agreed that you\nhad stopped caring about these things. However, if you will come, I will show you the way to my\nHomeland—it is along the path I must travel to find Vin. Hopefully, you will be able to convince the First\nGeneration of the things I have not.\"\n\"And that is?\" Sazed asked, still packing.\n\"That the end has arrived.\"\nRuin tried many times to get spikes into other members of the crew. Though some of what\nhappened makes it seem like it was easy for him to gain control of people, it really was not.\nSticking the metal in just the right place—at the right time—was incredibly difficult, even for a\nsubtle creature like Ruin. For instance, he tried very hard to spike both Elend and Yomen. Elend\nmanaged to avoid it each time, as he did on the field outside of the small village that contained\nthe next-to-last storage cache.\nRuin did actually manage to get a spike into Yomen, once. Yomen, however, removed the spike\nbefore Ruin got a firm grip on him. It was much easier for Ruin to get a hold on people who were\npassionate and impulsive than it was for him to hold on to people who were logical and prone to\nworking through their actions in their minds.\n63\n\"WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND,\" Vin said, \"is why you chose me. You had a thousand years and\nhundreds of thousands of people to choose from. Why lead me to the Well of Ascension to free you?\"\nShe was in her cell, sitting on her cot—which now lay legless on the floor, having collapsed when she\nremoved the screws. She'd asked for a new one. She'd been ignored.\nRuin turned toward her. He came often, wearing Reen's body, still indulging himself in what Vin could\nonly assume was a kind of gloating. As he often did, however, he ignored her question. Instead, he\nturned to the east, eyes seeming as if they could see directly through the cell wall.\n\"I wish you could see it,\" he said. \"The ashfalls have grown beautiful and deep, as if the sky itself has\nshattered, raining down shards of its corpse in flakes of black. You feel the ground tremble?\"\nVin didn't respond.\n\"Those quakes are the earth's final sighs,\" Ruin said. \"Like an old man, moaning as he dies, calling for\nhis children so that he can pass on his last bits of wisdom. The very ground is pulling itself apart. The\nLord Ruler did much of this himself. You can blame him, if you wish.\"\nVin perked up. She didn't draw attention to herself by asking more questions, but instead just let Ruin\nramble on. Again, she noted just how human some of his mannerisms seemed.\n\"He thought he could solve the problems himself,\" Ruin continued. \"He rejected me, you know.\"\nAnd that happened exactly a thousand years ago, Vin thought.

A thousand years has passed\nsince Alendi failed in his quest; a thousand years since Rashek took the power for himself and\nbecame the Lord Ruler. That's part of the answer to my question. The glowing liquid at the Well of\nAscension—it was gone by the time I finished freeing Ruin. It must have disappeared after Rashek\nused it too.\nA thousand years. Time for the Well to regenerate its power? But what was that power? Where\ndid it come from?\n\"The Lord Ruler didn't really save the world,\" Ruin continued. \"He just postponed its\ndestruction—and, in doing so, he helped me. That's the way it must always be, as I told you. When men\nthink they are helping the world, they actually do more harm than good. Just like you. You tried to help,\nbut you just ended up freeing me.\"\nRuin glanced at her, then smiled in a fatherly way. She didn't react.\n\"The ashmounts,\" Ruin continued, \"the dying landscape, the broken people—those were all Rashek's.\nThe twisting of men to become koloss, kandra, and Inquisitor, all his . . .\"\n\"But, you hated him,\" Vin said. \"He didn't free you—so you had to wait another thousand years.\"\n\"True,\" Ruin said. \"But a thousand years is not much time. Not much time at all. Besides, I couldn't\nrefuse to help Rashek. I help everyone, for my power is a tool—the only tool by which things can\nchange.\"\nIt's all ending, Vin thought. It really is. I don't have time to sit and wait. I need to do something.\nVin stood, causing Ruin to glance toward her as she walked to the front of the cell. \"Guards!\" she called.\nHer voice echoed in her own chamber. \"Guards!\" she repeated.\nEventually, she heard a thump outside. \"What?\" a rough voice demanded.\n\"Tell Yomen that I want to deal.\"\nThere was a pause.\n\"Deal?\" the guard finally asked.\n\"Yes,\" Vin said. \"Tell him I have information that I want to give him.\"\nShe wasn't certain how to read the guard's response, since it was simply more silence. She thought she\nheard him walking away, but without tin, she couldn't tell.\nEventually, however, the guard returned. Ruin watched her, curious, as the door unlocked and then\nopened. The customary troop of soldiers stood outside.\n\"Come with us.\"\n* * *\nAs Vin entered Yomen's audience chamber, she was immediately struck by the differences in the man.\nHe looked much more haggard than he had the last time they'd met, as if he'd gone far too long without\nsleep.\nBut . . . he's Mistborn, Vin thought with confusion. That means he could burn pewter to keep that\nfatigue out of his eyes.\nWhy doesn't he? Unless . . . he can't burn it.

To the side, Ruin trailed through the wall, stepping with an idle,\nunconcerned gait.\n\"Very well,\" Yomen said. \"How does Elend control the koloss?\"\n\"Allomancy,\" Vin said. \"Emotional Allomancy, when used on a koloss, will bring them under the\nAllomancer's control.\"\n\"I find that hard to believe,\" Yomen said flatly. \"If it were that simple, someone other than yourself\nwould have discovered it.\"\n\"Most Allomancers are too weak to manage it,\" Vin said. \"You need to use a metal that enhances your\npower.\"\n\"There is no such metal.\"\n\"You know of aluminum?\"\nYomen paused, but Vin could see in his eyes that he did. \"Duralumin is the Allomantic alloy of\naluminum,\" Vin said. \"Where aluminum dampens the power of other metals, duralumin enhances them.\nMix duralumin and zinc or brass, then Pull on the emotions of a koloss, and he will be yours.\"\nYomen didn't dismiss her comments as lies. Ruin, however, strolled forward, walking around Vin in a\ncircle.\n\"Vin, Vin. What is your game now?\" Ruin asked, amused. \"Lead him on with little tidbits, then betray\nhim?\"\nYomen apparently came to the same conclusion. \"Your facts are interesting, Empress, but completely\nunprovable in my present situation.

A second map overlaid the first, and Vin walked forward.\nYomen immediately shied backward, keeping out of reach.\nHe has good instincts, for a bureaucrat, she thought, slipping the charcoal out from underneath the\nmap. She quickly made her five marks again. With each one, her hand grew more tense. Each cavern\nwas in a rocky area, near metal mines. Even Luthadel bore rich mineral deposits. Lore said that the Lord\nRuler had constructed his capital in that location because of the mineral content in the area, particularly\nthe groundwater. That much the better for Allomancers.\n\"What are you trying to imply?\" Yomen asked. He'd edged close enough to see what she'd marked.\n\"This is the connection,\" Vin said. \"He built his storages near sources of metal.\"\n\"Or, it was simple chance.\"\n\"No,\" Vin said, looking up, glancing at Ruin. \"No, metal equals Allomancy, Yomen. There's a pattern\nhere.\"\nYomen waved her away again, approaching the map. He snorted. \"You've included marks near each\nof the most productive mines in the inner empire. You expect me to believe that you're not just playing\nme, offering some phantom 'evidence' that these really are the locations of the storage caverns?\"\nVin ignored him. Metal. The words of Kwaan were written in metal, because he said they were\nsafe. Safe. Safe from being changed, we assumed.\nOr, did he mean safe from being read?\nThe Lord Ruler had drawn his maps on metal plates."

Safe from being changed, we assumed.\nOr, did he mean safe from being read?\nThe Lord Ruler had drawn his maps on metal plates.\nSo, what if Ruin couldn't find the storages on his own because of the metal shielding them? He\nwould have needed someone to lead him. Someone to visit each one, read the map it contained,\nthen lead him on. . . .\nLord Ruler! We've made the same mistake again! We did exactly what he wanted. No wonder\nhe's let us live!\nHowever, instead of feeling ashamed, this time Vin felt herself growing angry. She glanced over at\nRuin, who stood there with his air of cosmic wisdom. His knowing eyes, his fatherly tone, and his deific\narrogance.\nNot again, Vin thought, gritting her teeth. This time, I'm on to him. That means I can trick him.\nBut . . . I need to know why. Why was he so interested in the storages? What is it he needs before\nhe wins this battle? What is the reason he's waited so long?\nSuddenly, the answer seemed obvious to her. As she examined her feelings, she realized that one of\nher main reasons for searching out the caches had repeatedly been discredited by Elend. Yet, Vin had\ncontinued to pursue the caches, searching for this one thing. She'd felt, for reasons she couldn't explain,\nthat it was important.\nThe thing that had driven the imperial economy for a thousand years. The most powerful of Allomantic\nmetals.\nAtium.\nWhy had she been so infatuated with it? Elend and Yomen were both right—atium was of little\nimportance in the current world. But, her feelings denied that. Why? Was it because Ruin wanted it, and\nVin had some unexplained connection to him?\nThe Lord Ruler had said Ruin couldn't read her mind. But she knew that he could affect her emotions.\nChange how she regarded things, push her forward. Drive her to search out the thing he wanted.\nLooking at the emotions that had affected her, she could see Ruin's plan, the way he had manipulated\nher, the way he thought. Ruin wanted the atium! And, with a chill of terror, Vin realized that she had led\nhim right to it. No wonder he was so smug before! Vin thought. No wonder he assumed that he'd\nwon!\nWhy would a god-like force would be so interested in a simple thing like an Allomantic metal? The\nquestion made her doubt her conclusions slightly. But at that moment, the doors to the chamber burst\nopen.\nAnd an Inquisitor stood beyond them.\nImmediately, Yomen and the soldiers all fell to one knee. Vin took an involuntary step backward. The\ncreature stood tall, like most of its kind, and still wore the gray robes of its pre-Collapse office. The bald\nhead was wrinkled with intricate tattoos, mostly black, one stark red. And, of course, there were the\nspikes driven point-first through its eyes. One of the spikes had been pounded in farther than the other,\ncrushing the socket around the spikehead. The creature's face, twisted by an inhuman sneer, had once\nbeen familiar to Vin.\n\"Marsh?\" Vin whispered in horror.\n\"My lord,\" Yomen said, spreading his hands out. \"You have finally come!

Marsh glanced at Vin, smiled slightly, but then pointedly ignored her. He did,\nhowever, look directly at Ruin and bow his head in subservience.\nVin shivered. Marsh's features, even twisted as they were, reminded her of his brother. Kelsier.\n\"You are about to be attacked, obligator,\" Marsh said, sweeping forward, throwing open the large\nwindow at the other side of the room. Through it, Vin could see over the rocky shelves to where Elend's\narmy camped beside the canal.\nExcept, there was no canal. There were no rocky shelves. Everything was just a uniform black. Ash\nfilled the sky, as thick as a snowstorm.\nLord Ruler! Vin thought. It's gotten so bad!\nYomen hurried over to the window. \"Attacked, my lord? But, they haven't even broken camp!\"\n\"The koloss will attack in surprise,\" the Inquisitor said. \"They don't need to form up ranks—they will\nsimply charge.\"\nYomen froze for a second, then turned to his soldiers. \"Hasten to the defenses. Gather the men on the\nforward rises!\"\nSoldiers scuttled from the room. Vin stood quietly. The man I know as Marsh is dead, she thought.\nHe tried to kill Sazed, now he's fully one of them. Ruin has . . .\nHas taken control of him. . . .\nAn idea began to spark in her mind.\n\"Quickly, obligator,\" Marsh said. \"I did not come to protect your foolish little city. I've come for the\nthing you discovered in that cache.\"\n\"My lord?\" Yomen said, surprised.\n\"Your atium, Yomen,\" the Inquisitor said. \"Give it to me. It cannot be in this city when that attack\ncomes, just in case you fall. I shall take it someplace safe.\"\nVin closed her eyes.\n\"My . . . lord?\" Yomen finally said. \"You are, of course, welcome to anything I possess. But, there\nwas no atium in the storage cache. Just the seven beads I had gathered myself, held as a reserve for the\nCanton of Resource.\"\nVin opened her eyes. \"What?\"\n\"Impossible!\" Marsh roared. \"But, you told the girl earlier that you had it!\"\nYomen paled. \"Misdirection, my lord. She seemed convinced that I had some wealth of atium, so I let\nher think that she was right.\"\n\"NO!\"\nVin jumped at the sudden yell. However, Yomen didn't even flinch—and a second later, she realized\nwhy. Ruin was the one who had screamed. He had become indistinct, losing Reen's form, his figure\nblossoming outward in a kind of tempest of whirling darkness. Almost like mist, only far, far blacker.\nShe'd seen that blackness before. She'd walked through it, in the cavern beneath Luthadel, on her way\nto the Well of Ascension."

He looked like Reen again. He folded his arms behind his back, and\ndidn't look at her, as if trying to pretend that he had not lost control. In his eyes, however, she could see\nfrustration. Anger. She edged away from him—edging closer to Marsh.\n\"You fool!\" Marsh said, walking away from her, speaking to Yomen. \"You idiot!\"\nDamn, Vin thought in annoyance.\n\"I . . .\" Yomen said, confused. \"My lord, why do you care for atium? It is worthless without\nAllomancers and house politicians to pay for it.\"\n\"You know nothing,\" Marsh snapped. Then, he smiled. \"But you are doomed. Yes . . . doomed\nindeed. . . .\"\nOutside, she could see that Elend's army was breaking camp. Yomen turned back to the window, and\nVin edged closer, ostensibly to give herself a better look. Elend's forces were gathering—men and\nkoloss. Most likely, they had noticed the buildup of city defenses, and had realized that they'd lost any\nopportunity for surprise.\n\"He's going to ravage this city,\" Ruin said, stepping up beside Vin. \"Your Elend is a good servant,\nchild. One of my finest. You should be proud of him.\"\n\"So many koloss . . .\" she heard Yomen whisper. \"My lord, there is no way we can fight so many. We\nneed your help.\"\n\"Why should I help you?\" Marsh asked. \"You who fail to deliver to me what I need?\"\n\"But I've remained faithful,\" Yomen said. \"When all others abandoned the Lord Ruler, I have\ncontinued to serve him.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler is dead,\" Marsh said with a snort. \"He was an unprofitable servant as well.\"\nYomen paled.\n\"Let this city burn before the wrath of forty thousand koloss,\" Marsh said.\nForty thousand koloss, Vin thought. He'd found more, somewhere. Attacking seemed the logical\nthing to do—he could finally capture the city, perhaps giving Vin a chance to escape in the chaos. Very\nlogical, very smart. And yet, suddenly, Vin became sure of one thing.\n\"Elend won't attack,\" she announced.\nSix eyes—two steel, two flesh, and two incorporeal—turned toward her.\n\"Elend won't loose that many koloss upon the city,\" she said. \"He's trying to intimidate you, Yomen.\nAnd you should listen. Would you still obey this creature, this Inquisitor? He disdains you. He wants you\nto die. Join with us instead.\"\nYomen frowned.\n\"You could fight him with me,\" Vin said. \"You're an Allomancer. These monsters can be defeated.\"\nMarsh smiled. \"Idealism from you, Vin?\"\n\"Idealism?\" she asked, facing the creature. \"You think it's idealistic to believe I can kill an Inquisitor?\nYou know I've done it before.\"\nMarsh waved a dismissive hand. \"I'm not talking about your foolish threats.

Only then do we understand the beauty there is in\ndestruction.\"\n\"Your god does not control Elend,\" Vin said. \"He keeps trying to claim that he does, but that only\nmakes him a liar. Or, perhaps, something of an idealist himself.\"\nYomen watched, confused.\n\"And if he does attack?\" Marsh asked with a quiet, eager voice. \"What would that mean, Vin? What if\nhe does send his koloss against this city in a blood frenzy, sends them to slaughter and kill, all so that he\ncan get what he thinks he needs so badly? Atium and food couldn't get him to come in . . . but you?\nHow would that make you feel? You killed for him. What makes you think that Elend won't do the same\nfor you?\"\nVin closed her eyes. Memories of her assault upon Cett's tower returned to her. Memories of wanton\nkilling, Zane at her side. Memories of fire, and death, and an Allomancer loosed.\nShe'd never killed like that again.\nShe opened her eyes. Why wouldn't Elend attack? Attacking made so much sense. He knew he could\ntake the city easily. However, he also knew he had trouble controlling the koloss when they reached too\ngreat a frenzy. . . .\n\"Elend won't attack,\" she said quietly. \"Because he's a better person than I am.\"\nOne might notice that Ruin did not send his Inquisitors to Fadrex until after Yomen\nhad—apparently—confirmed that the atium was there in the city. Why not send them as soon as\nthe final cache was located? Where were his minions in all of this?\nOne must realize that, in Ruin's mind, all men were his minions, particularly those whom he\ncould manipulate directly. He didn't send an Inquisitor because they were busy doing other tasks.\nInstead, he sent someone who—in his mind—was exactly the same thing as an Inquisitor.\nHe tried to spike Yomen, failed, and by that time, Elend's army had arrived. So, he used a\ndifferent pawn to investigate the cache for him and discover if the atium really was there or not.\nHe didn't commit too many resources to the city at first, fearing a deception on the Lord Ruler's\npart. Like him, I still wonder if the caches were, in part, intended for just that purpose—to\ndistract Ruin and keep him occupied.\n64\n\". . .

That's the one he'd been waiting for. Beldre.\n\"What's going on?\" Spook whispered.\nHands brought something to his lips—a water skin. They poured carefully, giving him a drink. He\ncoughed, but got it down. \"Why . . . why can't I move?\" Spook asked. The only thing he seemed able to\ntwitch was his left hand.\n\"Your body is being held in casts and bandages, Spook,\" Beldre said. \"Sazed's orders.\"\n\"The burns,\" Breeze said. \"Well, they aren't that bad, but . . .\"\n\"To hell with the burns,\" Spook croaked. \"I'm alive. I wasn't expecting that.\"\nBreeze looked up at Beldre, smiling.\nSend it flying. . . .\n\"Where is Sazed?\" Spook asked.\n\"You should really try to rest,\" Beldre said, rubbing his cheek softly. \"You've been through a lot.\"\n\"And slept through more, I expect,\" Spook said. \"Sazed?\"\n\"Gone, my dear boy,\" Breeze said. \"He went off south with Vin's kandra.\"\nVin.\nFeet clomped across the floor, and a second later, Captain Goradel's face appeared beside the other\ntwo. The square-jawed soldier smiled broadly. \"Survivor of the Flames indeed!\"\nYou have a clue that nobody else does. . . .\n\"How is the city?\" Spook asked.\n\"Mostly safe,\" Beldre said. \"The canals flooded, and my brother organized fire brigades.

Their troubled expressions were enough of a confirmation.\n\"We're getting a lot of refugees into the city,\" Beldre said. \"From surrounding cities and villages, some\nas far as Luthadel. . . .\"\n\"I need to send a message,\" Spook said. \"To Vin.\"\n\"All right,\" Breeze said soothingly. \"We'll do that as soon as you are better.\"\n\"Listen to me, Breeze,\" Spook said, staring up at the ceiling, unable to do much more than twitch."

Sometimes, it was easy to ignore the soldier, with his simple,\nstraightforward manner and his pleasant demeanor. However, the determination in his voice made Spook\nsmile.\n\"Lady Vin saved my life,\" Goradel said. \"The night of the Survivor's rebellion, she could have left me to\ndie at the hands of the mob. She could have killed me herself. But she took the time to tell me that she\nunderstood what I'd been through, and convinced me to switch sides. If she needs this information,\nSurvivor, then I will get it to her, or I will die trying.\"\nSpook tried to nod, but his head was held tight by the bandages and wrappings. He flexed his hand. It\nseemed to work . . . or, at least, work well enough.\nHe met Goradel's eyes. \"Go to the armory and have a sheet of metal pounded thin,\" Spook said.\n\"Then, return here with something I can use to scratch the metal. These words must be written in steel,\nand I cannot speak them aloud.\"\nIn those moments when the Lord Ruler both held the power at the Well and was feeling it drain\naway from him, he understood a great many things. He saw the power of Feruchemy, and rightly\nfeared it. Many of the Terris people, he knew, would reject him as the Hero, for he didn't fulfill\ntheir prophecies well. They'd see him as a usurper who killed the Hero they sent. Which, in truth,\nhe was.\nI think, over the years, Ruin would subtly twist him and make him do terrible things to his own\npeople. But at the beginning, I suspect his decision against them was motivated more by logic than\nemotion. He was about to unveil a grand power in the Mistborn.\nHe could have, I suppose, kept Allomancy secret and used Feruchemists as his primary warriors\nand assassins. However, I think he was wise to choose as he did. Feruchemists, by the nature of\ntheir powers, have a tendency toward scholarship. With their incredible memories, they would\nhave been very difficult to control over the centuries. Indeed, they were difficult to control, even\nwhen he suppressed them.

There probably wouldn't be any need for the human soldiers to attack. With his koloss\nalone, Elend had the numerical advantage, and it was unlikely Yomen's soldiers had ever fought the\ncreatures before.\nThe koloss sensed a fight. He could feel them getting excited. They strained against him, wishing to\nattack.\n\"Ham,\" he said, glancing down. \"Is this right?\"\nHam shrugged. \"This move does make sense, El,\" he said, rubbing his chin. \"Attacking is our only real\nchance of saving Vin. And, we can't hold the siege—not any longer.\" Ham paused, then shook his head,\nhis tone of voice taking on that uncertain quality it always did when he considered one of his logic\nproblems. \"Yet, loosing a group of koloss on a city does seem immoral. I wonder if you'll be able to\ncontrol them, once they begin to rampage. Is saving Vin worth the possibility of killing even one innocent\nchild? I don't know. Then again, maybe we'll save more children by bringing them into our empire. . . .\"\nI shouldn't have bothered to ask Ham, Elend thought. He never has been able to give a straight\nanswer. He looked out over the field, blue koloss against a plain of black. With tin, he could see men\ncowering on the tops of the Fadrex City ridges.\n\"No,\" Ham said.\nElend glanced down at the Thug.\n\"No,\" Ham repeated. \"We shouldn't attack.\"\n\"Ham?\" Elend said, feeling a surreal amusement. \"Did you actually come to a conclusion?\"\nHam nodded. \"Yes.\" He didn't offer explanation or rationalization.\nElend looked up. What would Vin do? His first instinct was to think that she'd attack. But then, he\nremembered when he had discovered her years before, after she'd assaulted Cett's tower. She'd been\nhuddled up in a corner, crying.\nNo, he thought. No, she wouldn't do this thing. Not to protect me. She's learned better.\n\"Ham,\" he said, surprising himself. \"Tell the men to pull back and disassemble camp. We're returning\nto Luthadel.\"\nHam looked back, surprised—as if he hadn't expected Elend to come to the same conclusion he had.\n\"And Vin?\"\n\"I'm not going to attack this city, Ham,\" Elend said. \"I won't conquer these people, even if it is for their\nown good.

You were so obvious. Your koloss always drew close to a city only after we discovered that it\nwas the next in line. You moved in to threaten us, make us move more quickly, but you never got your\nkoloss there too fast. The thing is, we knew all along.\"\n\"Impossible,\" Ruin whispered.\n\"No,\" Vin said. \"Quite possible. Atium is metal, Ruin. You can't see it. Your vision gets fuzzy when too\nmuch of it is around, doesn't it? Metal is your power; you use it to make Inquisitors, but it's like light to\nyou—blinding.

Marsh shook her too much,\nhowever, and her fingers couldn't find their mark.\n\"You will tell me where the atium is, child,\" Ruin said calmly. \"Haven't I explained this?

You don't even\nknow what that atium is.\"\nVin shook her head. \"You think I'd actually lead you to it?\"\nMarsh shook her again, rattling her, making her grit her teeth.

He stood straight-backed, not facing the window.\nHe fears that he's ordered his men to their deaths, Vin thought. She moved up to him, limping\nslightly from where she'd hit the ground. Marsh stood watching out the window. Ruin eyed her curiously.\n\"Yomen,\" she said.\nYomen turned toward her. \"It's a test,\" he said. \"The Inquisitors are the Lord Ruler's most holy priests.\nI'll do as commanded, and the Lord Ruler will protect my men and this city. Then you will see.\"\nVin gritted her teeth. Then, she turned and forced herself to walk up beside Marsh. She glanced out"

She glanced out\nthe window—and was surprised to see that Elend's army was retreating away from Yomen's soldiers.\nYomen's force wasn't running with very much conviction. Obviously, they were content to let their\nsuperior enemy run away before them. The sun was finally setting.\nMarsh did not seem to find Elend's retreat amusing. That was enough to make Vin smile—which made\nMarsh grab her again.\n\"You think you have won?\" Marsh asked, leaning down, his uneven spikeheads hanging just before\nVin's face.\nVin reached for his sash. Just a little farther. . . .\n\"You claim to have been playing with me, child,\" Ruin said, stepping up next to her. \"But you are the\none who has been played. The koloss who serve you, they get their strength from my power. You think\nthat I would let you control them if it weren't for my eventual gain?\"\nVin felt a moment of chill.\nOh, no. . . .\nElend felt a terrible ripping sensation. It was like a part of his innards had been suddenly, and forcibly,\npulled away from him. He gasped, releasing his Steelpush. He fell through the ash-filled sky, and landed\nunevenly on a rock shelf outside of Fadrex City.\nHe gasped, breathing in and out, trembling.\nWhat in the hell was that? he thought, standing up, holding his thumping head.\nAnd then he realized it. He couldn't feel the koloss anymore. In the distance, the massive blue\ncreatures stopped running away. And then, to Elend's horror, he watched them turn around.\nThey began to charge his men.\nMarsh held her. \"Hemalurgy is his power, Vin!\" he said. \"The Lord Ruler used it unwittingly! The fool!\nEach time he built an Inquisitor or a koloss, he made another servant for his enemy! Ruin waited\npatiently, knowing that when he finally broke free, he'd have an entire army waiting for him!\"\nYomen was at another window. He gasped quietly, watching. \"You did deliver my men!\" the obligator\nsaid. \"The koloss have turned to attack their own army!\"\n\"They'll come after your men next, Yomen,\" Vin said, dizzily. \"Then they'll destroy your city.\"\n\"It is ending,\" Ruin whispered. \"Everything needs to fit into place. Where is the atium? It's the last\npiece.\"\nMarsh shook her. She finally managed to reach his sash—and slipped her fingers into it. Fingers\ntrained by her brother, and by a lifetime on the street.\nThe fingers of a thief.\n\"You can't fool me, Vin,\" Ruin said. \"I am God.\"\nMarsh raised one hand—releasing her arm—then raised a fist as if to hit her. He moved with power,\npewter obviously burning inside of him. He was an Allomancer, like all Inquisitors. Which meant he\ntended to keep metals on his person. Vin flipped her hand up and downed the vial of metals she'd stolen\nfrom his sash.\nMarsh froze, and Ruin fell silent.\nVin smiled."

It was a tiny bit of metal, but it threw up a drop\nof blood as it hit, ripping through his head and passing out the other side.\nMarsh dropped, and Vin was thrown backward by her own Push. She crashed into the wall, causing\nsoldiers to scatter and yell, raising weapons. Yomen turned toward her, surprised.\n\"Yomen!\" she said. \"Bring your men back! Fortify the city!\" Ruin had disappeared in the chaos of her\nescape. Perhaps he was out overseeing the control of the koloss.\nYomen seemed indecisive. \"I . . . No. I will not lose faith. I must be strong.\"\nVin gritted her teeth, climbing to her feet. Nearly as frustrating as Elend is at times, she thought,\nscrambling over to Marsh's body. She reached into his sash, pulling out the second—and final—vial he\nhad stored there. She downed this, restoring the metals she'd lost to duralumin.\nThen, she hopped up on the windowsill. Mist puffed around her—the sun was still up, but the mists\nwere arriving earlier and earlier. Outside, she could see Elend's forces beleaguered by rampaging koloss\non one side, Yomen's soldiers not attacking—yet blocking retreat—on the other. She moved to jump out\nand join the fight, and then she noticed something.\nA small group of koloss. A thousand in number, small enough to apparently have been ignored by both\nElend's forces and Yomen's. Even Ruin appeared to have paid them no heed, for they simply stood in the\nash, partially buried, like a collection of quiet stones.\nVin's koloss. The ones that Elend had given her, Human at their lead. With a devious smile, she\nordered them forward.\nTo attack Yomen's men.\n\"I'm telling you, Yomen,\" she said, hopping off of the windowsill and back into the room. \"Those\nkoloss don't care which side the humans are on—they'll kill anyone.

Didn't you pay any attention to what this one said?\"\nYomen looked thoughtful.\n\"He even admitted that the Lord Ruler was dead, Yomen,\" Vin said with exasperation. \"Your faith is\ncommendable. But sometimes, you just have to know when to give up and move on!\"\nOne of the soldier captains yelled something, and Yomen spun back toward the window. He cursed.\nImmediately, Vin felt something.

And then, something grabbed her leg. She looked down with shock as Marsh\nclimbed to his knees. She had sliced through his brain itself, but the amazing Inquisitor healing powers\nseemed to be able to deal even with that.\n\"Fool,\" Marsh said, standing. \"Even if Yomen turns against me, I can kill him, and his soldiers will\nfollow me. He's given them a belief in the Lord Ruler, and I hold that belief by right of inheritance.\"\nVin took a deep breath, then hit Marsh with a duralumin-Soothing. If it worked on koloss and kandra,\nwhy not Inquisitors?\nMarsh stumbled. Vin's Push lasted a brief moment, but during it she felt something. A wall, like she'd\nfelt the first time she'd tried to control TenSoon or the first time she'd taken control of a group of koloss.\nShe Pushed, Pushed with everything she had. In a burst of power, she came close to seizing control of\nMarsh's body, but not close enough. The wall within his mind was too strong, and she only had one vial's\nworth of metal to use. The wall shoved her back. She cried out in frustration.\nMarsh reached out, growling, and grabbed her by the neck. She gasped, eyes widening as Marsh\nbegan to grow in size. Getting stronger, like . . .\nA Feruchemist, she realized. I'm in serious trouble.\nPeople in the room were yelling, but she couldn't hear them. Marsh's hand—now large and\nbeefy—gripped her throat, strangling her. Only flared pewter was keeping her alive. She flashed back to\nthe day, many years ago, when she'd been held by another Inquisitor. Standing in the Lord Ruler's throne\nroom.\nOn that day, Marsh himself had saved her life. It seemed a twisted irony that she would struggle now,\nbeing strangled by him.\nNot. Yet.\nThe mists began to swirl around her.\nMarsh started, though he continued to hold her.\nVin drew upon the mists.\nIt happened again. She didn't know how, or why, but it just happened. She breathed the mists into her\nbody, as she had on that day so long ago when she'd killed the Lord Ruler. She somehow pulled them\ninto her and used them to fuel her body with an incredible Allomantic surge of power.\nAnd, with that power, she Pushed on Marsh's emotions.\nThe wall inside of him cracked, then burst. For a moment, Vin felt a sense of vertigo. She saw things\nthrough Marsh's eyes—indeed, she felt like she understood him. His love of destruction, and his hatred\nof himself. And through him, she caught a brief glimpse of something. A hateful, destructive thing that hid\nbehind a mask of civility.\nRuin was not the same thing as the mists."

A hateful, destructive thing that hid\nbehind a mask of civility.\nRuin was not the same thing as the mists.\nMarsh cried out, dropping her. Her strange burst of power dissipated, but it didn't matter, for Marsh\nfled out the window and Pushed himself away through the mists. Vin picked herself up, coughing.\nI did it. I drew upon the mists again. But why now? Why, after all the trying, did it happen now?\nThere was no time to consider it at the moment—not with the koloss attacking. She turned to the\nbaffled Yomen. \"Continue to retreat into the city!\" she said. \"I'm going out to help.\"\nElend fought desperately, cutting down koloss after koloss. It was difficult, dangerous work, even for\nhim. These koloss couldn't be controlled—no matter how he Pushed or Pulled on their emotions, he\ncouldn't bring even one of them under his power.\nThat only left fighting. And, his men weren't prepared for battle—he'd forced them to abandon camp\ntoo quickly.\nA koloss swung, its sword whooshing dangerously close to Elend's head. He cursed, dropping a coin\nand Pushing himself backward through the air, over his fighting men and back into camp. They'd\nmanaged to retreat back to the positioning of their original fortification, which meant that they had a small\nhill for defense and didn't have to fight in ash. A group of his Coinshots—he only had ten—stood firing\nwave after wave of coins into the main bulk of the koloss, and archers threw similar volleys. The main line\nof soldiers was supported by Lurchers from behind, who would Pull on koloss weapons and throw them\noff balance, giving the regular men extra openings. Thugs ran around the perimeter in groups of two or\nthree, shoring up weak spots and acting as reserves.\nEven with all of that, they were in serious trouble. Elend's army couldn't stand against so many koloss\nany more easily than Fadrex could have. Elend landed in the middle of the half-disassembled camp,\nbreathing heavily, covered in koloss blood. Men yelled as they fought a short distance away, holding the\ncamp perimeter with the help of Elend's Allomancers. The bulk of the koloss army was still bunched\naround the northern section of camp, but Elend couldn't pull his men back any farther toward Fadrex\nwithout exposing them to Yomen's archers.\nElend tried to catch his breath as a servant rushed up with a cup of water for him. Cett sat a short\ndistance away, directing the battle tactics. Elend tossed aside the empty cup and moved over to the\ngeneral, who sat at a small table. It held a map of the area, but hadn't been marked on. The koloss were\nso close, the battle happening just yards away, that it wasn't really necessary to keep an abstract battle\nmap.\n\"Never did like having those things in the army,\" Cett said as he downed a cup of water himself. A\nservant moved over, leading a surgeon, who pulled out a bandage to begin working on Elend's\narm—which, up until that moment, he hadn't noticed was bleeding."

The sky was nearly dark. They didn't have much time\nbefore—\nA figure landed on the table in front of Cett. \"Elend!\" Vin said. \"Retreat to the city. Yomen will let you\nin.\"\nElend started. \"Vin!\" Then, he smiled. \"What took you so long?\"\n\"I got delayed by an Inquisitor and a dark god,\" she said. \"Now, hustle. I'll go see if I can distract\nsome of those koloss.\"\nInquisitors had little chance of resisting Ruin. They had more spikes than any of his other\nHemalurgic creations, and that put them completely under his domination.\nYes, it would have taken a man of supreme will to resist Ruin even slightly while bearing the\nspikes of an Inquisitor.\n66\nSAZED TRIED NOT TO THINK about how dark the ash was in the sky, or how terrible the land\nlooked.\nI've been such a fool, he thought, riding in the saddle. Of all the times that the world needed\nsomething to believe in, this is it. And I wasn't there to give it to them.\nHe hurt from so much riding, yet he clung to the saddle, still somewhat amazed at the creature who ran\nbeneath him. When Sazed had first decided to go with TenSoon south, he had despaired at making the\ntrip. Ash fell like the snows of a blizzard, and it had piled terribly high in most places. Sazed had known\ntravel would be difficult, and he'd feared slowing TenSoon, who could obviously travel far more quickly\nas a wolfhound.\nTenSoon considered this concern, then had ordered a horse and a large hog to be brought to him.\nTenSoon first ingested the hog to give himself extra mass, then molded his gel-like flesh around the horse\nto digest it as well. Within an hour, he'd formed his body into a replica of the horse—but one with\nenhanced muscles and weight, creating the enormous, extra-strong marvel which Sazed now rode.\nThey'd been running nonstop since then. Fortunately, Sazed had some wakefulness he'd stored in a\nmetalmind a year ago, after the siege of Luthadel. He used this to keep himself from falling asleep. It still\namazed him that TenSoon could enhance a horse's body so well. It moved with ease through the thick\nash, where a real horse—and certainly a human—would have balked at the difficulty. Another thing I've\nbeen a fool about. These last few days, I could have been interrogating TenSoon about his powers.\nHow much more is there that I don't know?\nDespite his shame, however, Sazed felt something of peace within himself. If he'd continued to teach\nabout religions after he'd stopped believing in them, then he would have been a true hypocrite. Tindwyl\nhad believed in giving people hope, even if one had to tell them lies to do so. That's the credit she had\ngiven to religion: lies that made people feel better."

That's the credit she had\ngiven to religion: lies that made people feel better.\nSazed couldn't have acted the same way—at least, he couldn't have done so and remained the person\nhe wanted to be. However, he now had hope. The Terris religion was the one that had taught about the\nHero of Ages in the first place. If any contained the truth, it would be this one. Sazed needed to\ninterrogate the First Generation of kandra and discover what they knew.\nThough, if I do find the truth, what will I do with it?\nThe trees they passed were stripped of leaves. The landscape was covered in a good four feet of ash.\n\"How can you keep going like this?\" Sazed asked as the kandra galloped over a hilltop, shoving aside\nash and ignoring obstructions.\n\"My people are created from mistwraiths,\" TenSoon explained, not even sounding winded. \"The Lord\nRuler turned the Feruchemists into mistwraiths, and they began to breed true as a species. You add a\nBlessing to a mistwraith, and they become awakened, turning into a kandra. One such as I, created\ncenturies after the Ascension, was born as a mistwraith but became awakened when I received my\nBlessing.\"\n\". . . Blessing?\" Sazed asked.\n\"Two small metal spikes, Keeper,\" TenSoon said. \"We are created like Inquisitors, or like koloss.\nHowever, we are more subtle creations than either of those. We were made third and last, as the Lord\nRuler's power waned.\"\nSazed frowned, leaning low as the horse ran beneath some skeletal tree branches.\n\"What is different about you?\"\n\"We have more independence of will than the other two,\" TenSoon said. \"We only have two spikes in\nus, while the others have more. An Allomancer can still take control of us, but free we remain more\nindependent of mind than koloss or Inquisitors, who are both affected by Ruin's impulses even when he\nisn't directly controlling them. Did you never wonder why both of them are driven so powerfully to kill?\"\n\"That doesn't explain how you can carry me, all our baggage, and still run through this ash.\"\n\"The metal spikes we carry grant us things,\" TenSoon said. \"Much as Feruchemy gives you strength,\nor Allomancy gives Vin strength, my Blessing gives me strength. It will never run out, but it isn't as\nspectacular as the bursts your people can create. Still, my Blessing—mixed with my ability to craft my\nbody as I wish—allows me a high level of endurance.\"\nSazed fell silent. They continued to gallop.\n\"There isn't much time left,\" TenSoon noted.\n\"I can see that,\" Sazed said. \"It makes me wonder what we can do.\"\n\"This is the only time in which we could succeed,\" TenSoon said. \"We must be poised, ready to strike.\nReady to aid the Hero of Ages when she comes.\"\n\"Comes?\"\n\"She will lead an army of Allomancers to the Homeland,\" TenSoon said, \"and there will save all of\nus—kandra, human, koloss, and Inquisitor.\""

Something very difficult, yet necessary. My\npeople will resist it, but perhaps you can show them the way.\"\nSazed nodded, then climbed off of the kandra to stretch his legs.\n\"Do you recognize this location?\" TenSoon asked, turning to look at him with a horse's head.\n\"I do not,\" Sazed said. \"With the ash . . . well, I haven't really been able to follow our path for days.\"\n\"Over that ridge, you will find the place where the Terris people have set up their refugee camp.\"\nSazed turned with surprise. \"The Pits of Hathsin?\"\nTenSoon nodded. \"We call it the Homeland.\"\n\"The Pits?\" Sazed asked with shock. \"But . . .\"\n\"Well, not the Pits themselves,\" TenSoon said. \"You know that this entire area has cave complexes\nbeneath it?\"\nSazed nodded. The place where Kelsier had trained his original army of skaa soldiers was just a short\ntrip to the north.\n\"Well, one of those cave complexes is the kandra Homeland. It abuts the Pits of Hathsin—in fact,\nseveral of the kandra passages run into the Pits, and had to be kept closed off, lest workers in the Pits\nfind their way into the Homeland.\"\n\"Does your Homeland grow atium?\" Sazed asked.\n\"Grow it? No, it does not. That is, I suppose, what separates the Homeland from the Pits of Hathsin.\nEither way, the entrance to my people's caverns is right there.\"\nSazed turned with a start. \"Where?\"\n\"That depression in the ash,\" TenSoon said, nodding his large head toward it. \"Good luck, Keeper. I\nhave my own duties to attend to.\"\nSazed nodded, feeling shocked that they had traveled so far so quickly, and untied his pack from the\nkandra's back. He left the bag containing bones—those of the wolfhound, and another set that looked\nhuman. Probably a body TenSoon carried to use should he need it.\nThe enormous horse turned to go.\n\"Wait!\" Sazed said, raising a hand.\nTenSoon looked back.\n\"Good luck,\" Sazed said. \"May . . . our god preserve you.\"\nTenSoon smiled with a strange equine expression, then took off, galloping through the ash.\nSazed turned to the depression in the ground. Then, he hefted his pack—filled with metalminds and a\nsolitary tome—and walked forward. Even moving that short distance in the ash was difficult. He reached\nthe depression and—taking a breath—began to dig his way into the ash.\nHe didn't get far before he slid down into a tunnel.

Sazed stood up in the cavern, then reached into his pack and pulled out a tinmind.\nWith this, he tapped eyesight, improving his vision as he walked into the darkness.\nA tinmind didn't work as well as an Allomancer's tin—or, rather, it didn't work in the same way. It\ncould allow one to see very great distances, but it was of far less help in poor illumination. Soon, even\nwith his tinmind, Sazed was walking in darkness, feeling his way along the tunnel.\nAnd then, he saw light.\n\"Halt!\" a voice called. \"Who returns from Contract?\"\nSazed continued forward. A part of him was frightened, but another part was just curious. He knew a\nvery important fact.\nKandra could not kill humans.\nSazed stepped up to the light, which turned out to be a melon-sized rock atop a pole, its porous\nmaterial coated with some kind of glowing fungus. A pair of kandra blocked his path. They were easily\nidentifiable as such since they wore no clothing and their skins were translucent. They appeared to have\nbones carved from rock.\nFascinating! Sazed thought. They make their own bones. I really do have a new culture to\nexplore. A whole new society—art, religion, mores, gender interactions. . . .\nThe prospect was so exciting that, for a moment, even the end of the world seemed trivial by\ncomparison. He had to remind himself to focus. He needed to investigate their religion first. Other things\nwere secondary.\n\"Kandra, who are you? Which bones do you wear?\"\n\"You are going to be surprised, I think,\" Sazed said as gently as he could. \"For, I am no kandra. My\nname is Sazed, Keeper of Terris, and I have been sent to speak with the First Generation.\"\nBoth kandra guards started.\n\"You don't have to let me pass,\" Sazed said. \"Of course, if you don't take me into your Homeland,\nthen I'll have to leave and tell everyone on the outside where it is. . . .\"\nThe guards turned to each other. \"Come with us,\" one of them finally said.\nKoloss also had little chance of breaking free. Four spikes, and their diminished mental capacity,\nleft them fairly easy to dominate. Only in the throes of a blood frenzy did they have any form of\nautonomy.\nFour spikes also made them easier for Allomancers to control. In our time, it required a\nduralumin Push to take control of a kandra. Koloss, however, could be taken by a determined\nregular Push, particularly when they were frenzied.\n67\nELEND AND VIN STOOD ATOP the Fadrex City fortifications. The rock ledge had once held the\nbonfires they'd watched in the night sky—she could see the blackened scar from one of them just to her\nleft.\nIt felt good to be held by Elend again. His warmth was a comfort, particularly when looking out of the\ncity, over the field that Elend's army had once occupied. The koloss army was growing. It stood silently\nin the blizzard-like ash, thousands strong. More and more of the creatures were arriving each day,\namassing to an overwhelming force."

He was the only other one who stood on\nthe overlook; Ham and Cett were down below, seeing to the army's preparation. They'd need to be\nready to defend the moment that the koloss assaulted the city.\n\"He wants us to know just how soundly he's going to beat us,\" Vin said. Plus, she added in her mind,\nhe's waiting. Waiting on that last bit of information.\nWhere is the atium?\nShe'd fooled Ruin. She'd proven to herself that it could be done. Yet, she was still frustrated. She felt\nlike she'd spent the last few years of her life reacting to every wiggle of Ruin's fingers. Each time she\nthought herself clever, wise, or self-sacrificing, she discovered that she'd simply been doing his will the\nentire time. It made her angry.\nBut what could she do?\nI have to make Ruin play his hand, she thought. Make him act, expose himself.\nFor a brief moment, back in Yomen's throne room, she had felt something amazing. With the strange\npower she'd gained from the mists, she'd touched Ruin's own mind—via Marsh—and seen something\ntherein.\nFear. She remembered it, distinct and pure. At that moment, Ruin had been afraid of her. That's why\nMarsh had fled.\nSomehow, she'd taken the power of the mists into her, then used them to perform Allomancy of\nsurpassing might. She'd done it before, when fighting the Lord Ruler in his palace. Why could she only\ndraw on that power at random, unpredictable times? She'd wanted to use it against Zane, but had failed.\nShe'd tried a dozen times during the last few days, just as she'd tried during the days following the Lord\nRuler's death. She'd never been able to access even a hint of that power.\nIt struck like a thunderclap.\nA massive, overpowering quake rolled across the land. The rock ledges around Fadrex broke, some\nof them tumbling to the ground. Vin remained on her feet, but only with the help of pewter, and she\nbarely snatched Yomen by the front of his obligator robes as he careened and almost fell from their\nledge. Elend grabbed her arm, reinforcing her as the sudden quake shook the land. Inside the city,\nseveral buildings fell.\nThen, all went still. Vin breathed heavily, forehead slicked with sweat, Yomen's robes clutched in her\ngrip. She glanced at Elend.\n\"That one was far worse than the previous ones,\" he said, cursing quietly to himself.\n\"We're doomed,\" Yomen said softly, forcing himself to his feet. \"If the things you say are true, then not\nonly is the Lord Ruler dead, but the thing he spent his life fighting has now come to destroy the world.\"\n\"We've survived this long,\" Elend said firmly. \"We'll make it yet. Earthquakes may hurt us, but they\nhurt the koloss too—look, and you'll see that some of them were crushed by toppling rocks. If things get\nrough up here, we can retreat inside the cavern.\""

None of this was built for earthquakes—but if I know the Lord\nRuler, he anticipated the quakes, and picked caverns that were solid and capable of withstanding them.\"\nYomen seemed to take little comfort in the words, but Vin smiled. Not because of what Elend said,\nbut because of how he said it. Something about him had changed. He seemed confident in a way he'd\nnever been before. He had some of the same idealistic air he'd expressed when he'd been a youth at\ncourt—yet he also had the hardness of the man who'd led his people in war.\nHe'd finally found the balance. And, oddly enough, it had come from deciding to retreat.\n\"He does have a point, however, Vin,\" Elend said in a softer tone. \"We need to figure out our next\nstep. Ruin obviously intended to defeat us here, but he has been pushed back for a time, at least. What\nnow?\"\nWe have to trick him, she thought. Perhaps . . . use the same strategy Yomen used on me?\nShe paused, considering the idea. She reached up, fingering her earring. It had been mangled after its\ntrip through Marsh's head, of course, but it had been a simple matter to have a smith bend it back into\nshape.\nThe first time she'd met with Yomen, he'd given her back the earring. It had seemed like a strange\nmove, giving metal to an Allomancer. Yet, in a controlled environment, it had been very clever. He'd\nbeen able to test and see if she had any hidden metals—all the while reserving the fact that he could burn\natium and protect himself.\nLater, he'd been able to get her to reveal her hand, to attack and show him what she was planning, so\nthat he could defuse it in a situation where he was in power. Could she do the same to Ruin?\nThat thought mixed with another one. Both times when the mists had helped her, they had come in a\nmoment of pure desperation. It was as if they reacted to her need. So, was there a way to put herself in a\nsituation where her need was even greater than before? It was a thin hope, but—mixed with her desire to\nforce Ruin's hand—it formed a plan in her head.\nPut herself in danger. Make Ruin bring his Inquisitors, putting Vin in a situation where the mists had to\nhelp her. If that didn't work, maybe she could get Ruin to play his hand or spring any hidden traps he had\nwaiting for her.\nIt was incredibly risky, but she could feel that she didn't have much time. Ruin would win soon—very\nsoon—unless she did something. And, this was all she could think of to do. But, how could she make it\nhappen without explaining it to Elend? She couldn't speak of the plan, lest she reveal to Ruin what she\nwas doing.\nShe looked up at Elend, a man she seemed to know better than herself. He hadn't needed to tell her"

Perhaps . . . \"Elend,\" she said, \"I think\nthere's only one way to save this city.\"\n\"And that is?\" he said slowly.\n\"I have to go get it.\"\nElend frowned, then opened his mouth. She looked into his eyes, hoping. He paused.\n\"The . . . atium?\" he guessed.\nVin smiled. \"Yes. Ruin knows that we have it. He'll find it even if we don't use it. But, if we bring it\nhere, at least we can fight.\"\n\"It would be safer here anyway,\" Elend said slowly, eyes confused, but trusting her. \"I'd rather have an\narmy between those riches and our enemies. Perhaps we could use it to bribe some local warlords to\nhelp us.\"\nIt seemed a flimsy ruse to her. And yet, she knew that was because she could see Elend's confusion,\ncould read his lies in his eyes. She understood him, as he understood her. It was an understanding that\nrequired love.\nAnd she suspected that was something that Ruin would never be able to comprehend.\n\"I need to leave, then,\" she said, embracing him tightly, closing her eyes.\n\"I know.\"\nShe held him close for a few moments longer, feeling the ash fall around her, blow against her skin and\ncheek. Feeling Elend's heart beat beneath her ear. She leaned up and kissed him. Finally, she pulled\nback, then checked her metals. She met his eyes, and he nodded, so she jumped down into the city to\ngather some horseshoes.\nA few moments later, she was shooting through the ashy air toward Luthadel, a maelstrom of metal\naround her. Elend stood silently behind, on the rock ledge, watching her go.\nNow, she thought to Ruin, who she knew was watching her carefully, even though he hadn't revealed\nhimself since she'd drawn upon the mists. Let's have a chase, you and I.\nWhen the Lord Ruler offered his plan to his Feruchemist friends—the plan to change them into\nmistwraiths—he was making them speak on behalf of all the land's Feruchemists. Though he\nchanged his friends into kandra to restore their minds and memories, the rest he left as\nnonsentient mistwraiths. These bred more of their kind, living and dying, becoming a race unto\nthemselves. From these children of the original mistwraiths, he made the next generations of\nkandra.\nHowever, even gods can make mistakes, I have learned. Rashek, the Lord Ruler, thought to\ntransform all of the living Feruchemists into mistwraiths. However, he did not think of the genetic\nheritage left in the other Terris people, whom he left alive. So it was that Feruchemists continued\nbeing born, if only rarely.\nThis oversight cost him much, but gained the world so much more.\n68\nSAZED WALKED IN WONDER, led by his guards.

He saw kandra after kandra, each one with a\nmore interesting body than the one before. Some were tall and willowy, with bones made of white wood.\nOthers were stocky, with bones thicker than any human's. All stuck generally to human body shapes,\nhowever.\nThey used to be human, he reminded himself. Or, at least, their ancestors were.\nThe caverns around him felt old. The pathways were worn smooth, and while there were no real\n\"buildings,\" he passed many smaller caverns, varied drapery hanging in front of their openings. There was\na sense of exquisite craftsmanship to it all, from the carved poles that held the fungus lights, to the very\nbones of the people around him. It wasn't the detailed ornamentation of a nobleman's keep, for there\nwere no patterns, leaves, or knots carved into the stonework or bones. Instead, things were polished\nsmooth, carved with rounded sides, or woven in broad lines and shapes.\nThe kandra seemed afraid of him. It was a strange experience for Sazed. He had been many things in\nhis life: rebel, servant, friend, scholar. However, never before had he found himself an object of fear.\nKandra ducked around corners, peeking at him. Others stood in shock, watching him pass. Obviously,\nnews of his arrival had spread quickly, otherwise they would have just assumed him to be a kandra\nwearing human bones.\nHis guards led him to a steel door set into a large cavern wall. One of them moved inside, while the\nother guarded Sazed. Sazed noticed shards of metal twinkling in the kandra's shoulders. They appeared\nto be spikes, one in each shoulder.\nSmaller than Inquisitor spikes, Sazed thought. But still very effective. Interesting.\n\"What would you do if I were to run?\" Sazed asked.\nThe kandra started. \"Um . . .\"\n\"Can I assume from your hesitance that you are still forbidden to harm, or at least kill, a human?\"\nSazed asked.\n\"We follow the First Contract.\"\n\"Ah,\" Sazed said. \"Very interesting. And, with whom did you make the First Contract?\"\n\"The Father.\"\n\"The Lord Ruler?\" Sazed asked.\nThe kandra nodded.\n\"He is, unfortunately and truly, dead. So, is your Contract no longer valid?\"\n\"I don't know,\" the kandra said, looking away.\nSo, Sazed thought, not all of them are as forceful of personality as TenSoon. Even when he was\nplaying the part of a simple wolfhound, I found him to be intense.\nThe other soldier returned. \"Come with me,\" he said.\nThey led Sazed through the open metal doors. The room beyond had a large metal pedestal a few feet\nhigh. The guards did not step on it, but led Sazed around it toward a place before a group of stone\nlecterns. Many of the lecterns were empty, though kandra with twinkling bones stood behind two of\nthem. These creatures were tall—or, at least, they used tall bones—and very fine-featured.\nAristocrats, Sazed thought. He had found that class of people very easy to identify, no matter what\nthe culture or—apparently—species."

He had found that class of people very easy to identify, no matter what\nthe culture or—apparently—species.\nSazed's guards gestured for him to stand before the lecterns. Sazed ignored the gestures, walking in a\ncircle around the room. As he had expected, his guards didn't know what to do—they followed, but\nrefrained from putting their hands on him.\n\"There is metal plating surrounding the entire chamber,\" Sazed noted. \"Is it ornamental, or does it serve\na function?\"\n\"We will be asking the questions here, Terrisman!\" said one of the aristocratic kandra.\nSazed paused, turning. \"No,\" he said. \"No, you will not. I am Sazed, Keeper of Terris. However,\namong your people, I have another name. Holy Announcer.\"\nThe other kandra leader snorted. \"What does an outsider know of such things?\"\n\"An outsider?\" Sazed asked. \"You should better learn your own doctrine, I think.\" He began to walk\nforward. \"I am Terris, as are you. Yes, I know your origins. I know how you were created—and I know\nthe heritage you bring with you.\"\nHe stopped before their lecterns. \"I announce to you that I have discovered the Hero. I have lived with\nher, worked with her, and watched her. I handed her the very spear she used to slay the Lord Ruler. I\nhave seen her take command of kings, watched her overcome armies of both men and koloss. I have\ncome to announce this to you, so that you may prepare yourselves.\"\nHe paused, eyeing them. \"For the end is here,\" he added.\nThe two kandra stood quietly for a few moments. \"Go get the others,\" one finally said, his voice\nshaking.\nSazed smiled. As one of the guards ran off, Sazed turned to face down the second soldier. \"I shall\nrequire a table and chair, please. Also, something with which to write.\"\nA few minutes later, all was ready. His kandra attendants had swelled from four to over\ntwenty—twelve of them being the aristocratic ones with the twinkling bones. Some attendants had set up\na small table for Sazed, and he seated himself as the kandra nobles spoke together in anxious whispers.\nCarefully, Sazed placed his pack on the table and began to remove his metal-minds. Small rings,\nsmaller earrings and studs, and large bracers soon lined the table. He pushed up his sleeves, then clasped\non his copperminds—two large bracers on the upper arms, then two bracers on the forearms. Finally, he\nremoved his tome from the pack and set it on the table. Some kandra approached with thin plates of\nmetal. Sazed watched curiously as they arranged them for him, along with what appeared to be a steel\npen, capable of making indentations in the soft writing metal. The kandra servants bowed and withdrew.\nExcellent, Sazed thought, picking up the metal pen and clearing his throat. The kandra leaders turned\ntoward him.\n\"I assume,\" Sazed said, \"that you are the First Generation?\"\n\"We are the Second Generation, Terrisman,\" one of the kandra said.\n\"Well, I apologize for taking your time, then. Where can I find your superiors?\""

I see no reason for you to speak with the First Generation, even if you can blaspheme quite\naccurately.\"\nSazed raised an eyebrow. \"Blaspheme?\"\n\"You are not the Announcer,\" the kandra said. \"This is not the end.\"\n\"Have you seen the ash up above?\" Sazed said. \"Or, has it stopped up the entrances to this cavern\ncomplex so soundly that nobody can escape to see that the world is falling apart?\"\n\"We have lived a very long time, Terrisman,\" one of the other kandra said. \"We have seen periods\nwhere the ash fell more copiously than others.\"\n\"Oh?\" Sazed asked. \"And you have, perhaps, seen the Lord Ruler die before as well?\"\nSome of the kandra looked uncomfortable at this, though the one at the lead shook his head. \"Did\nTenSoon send you?\"\n\"He did,\" Sazed admitted.\n\"You can make no arguments other than those he has already made,\" the kandra said. \"Why would he\nthink that you—an outsider—could persuade us, when he could not?\"\n\"Perhaps because he understood something about me,\" Sazed said, tapping his book with his pen.\n\"Are you aware of the ways of Keepers, kandra?\"\n\"My name is KanPaar,\" the kandra said. \"And yes, I understand what Keepers do—or, at least, what\nthey did, before the Father was killed.\"\n\"Then,\" Sazed said, \"perhaps you know that every Keeper has an area of specialty. The intention was\nthat when the Lord Ruler finally did fall, we would already be divided into specialists who could teach our\nknowledge to the people.\"\n\"Yes,\" KanPaar said.\n\"Well,\" Sazed said, rubbing fingers over his book. \"My specialty was religion. Do you know how\nmany religions there were before the Lord Ruler's Ascension?\"\n\"I don't know. Hundreds.\"\n\"We have record of five hundred and sixty-three,\" Sazed said. \"Though that includes sects of the same\nreligions. In a more strict count, there were around three hundred.\"\n\"And?\" KanPaar asked.\n\"Do you know how many of these survived until this day?\" Sazed asked.\n\"None?\"\n\"One,\" Sazed said, holding up a finger. \"Yours. The Terris religion. Do you think it a coincidence that\nthe religion you follow not only still exists, but also foretells this exact day?\"\nKanPaar snorted. \"You are saying nothing new. So my religion is real, while others were lies. What\ndoes that explain?\"\n\"That you should listen, perhaps, to members of your faith who bring you tidings.\" Sazed began to flip\nthrough his book. \"At the very least, I would think that you'd be interested in this book, as it contains the\ncollected information about the Hero of Ages that I was able to discover. Since I knew little of the true\nTerris religion, I had to get my information from secondhand accounts—from tales and stories, and from\ntexts written during the intermediate time."

Therefore, it is quite well corrupted\nand tainted by his touch.\"\n\"And why would I be interested?\" KanPaar asked. \"You just told me that your information is corrupt\nand useless.\"\n\"Useless?\" Sazed asked. \"No, not useless at all. Corrupt, yes. Changed by Ruin. My friend, I have a\ntome here filled with Ruin's lies. You have a mind filled with the original truths. Apart, we know very little.\nHowever, if we were to compare—discovering precisely which items Ruin changed—would it not tell us\nexactly what his plan is? At the very least, it would tell us what he didn't want us to focus on, I think.\"\nThe room fell silent.\n\"Well,\" KanPaar finally said, \"I—\"\n\"That will be enough, KanPaar,\" a voice said.\nSazed paused, cocking his head. The voice hadn't come from any of those beside the pedestals. Sazed\nglanced around the room, trying to discover who had spoken.\n\"You may leave, Seconds,\" another voice said.\nOne of the Seconds gasped. \"Leave? Leave you with this one, an outsider?\"\n\"A descendant,\" one of the voices said. \"A Worldbringer. We will hear him.\"\n\"Leave us,\" said another voice.\nSazed raised an eyebrow, sitting as the Second Generationers—looking rattled—left their lecterns and\nquietly made their way from the room. A pair of guards pushed the doors shut, blocking the view of\nthose kandra who had been watching outside. Sazed was left alone in the room with the phantoms who\nhad spoken.\nSazed heard a scraping sound. It echoed through the steel-lined chamber, and then a door opened at\nthe back of the room. From this came what he assumed was the First Generation. They looked . . . old.\nTheir kandra flesh literally hung from their bodies, drooping, like translucent tree moss dripping from\nbone branches. They were stooped, seeming older than the other kandra he had seen, and they didn't\nwalk so much as shuffle.\nThey wore simple robes, with no sleeves, but the garments still looked odd on the creatures. In\naddition, beneath their translucent skin, he could see that they had white, normal skeletons. \"Human\nbones?\" Sazed asked as the elderly creatures made their way forward, walking with canes.\n\"Our own bones,\" one of them said, speaking with a tired near-whisper of a voice. \"We hadn't the skill\nor knowledge to form True Bodies when this all began, and so took our original bones again when the\nLord Ruler gave them to us.\"\nThe First Generation appeared to have only ten members. They arranged themselves on the benches.\nAnd, out of respect, Sazed moved his table so that he was seated before them, like a presenter before an\naudience.\n\"Now,\" he said, raising his metal scratching pen. \"Let us begin—we have much work to do.\"\nThe question remains, where did the original prophecies about the Hero of Ages come from?

I\nnow know that Ruin changed them, but did not fabricate them. Who first taught that a Hero\nwould come, one who would be an emperor of all mankind, yet would be rejected by his own\npeople? Who first stated he would carry the future of the world on his arms, or that he would\nrepair that which had been sundered?\nAnd who decided to use the neutral pronoun, so that we wouldn't know if the Hero was a\nwoman or a man?\n69\nMARSH KNELT IN A PILE OF ASH, hating himself and the world. The ash fell without cease,\ndrifting onto his back, covering him, and yet he did not move.\nHe had been cast aside, told to sit and wait. Like a tool forgotten in the yard, slowly being covered in\nsnow.\nI was there, he thought. With Vin. Yet . . . I couldn't speak to her. Couldn't tell her anything.\nWorse . . . he hadn't wanted to. During his entire conversation with her, his body and mind had\nbelonged to Ruin completely. Marsh had been helpless to resist, hadn't been able to do anything that\nmight have let Vin kill him.\nExcept for a moment. A moment near the end, when she'd almost taken control of him. A moment\nwhen he'd seen something inside of his master—his god, his self—that gave him hope.\nFor in that moment, Ruin had feared her.\nAnd then, Ruin had forced Marsh to run, leaving behind his army of koloss—the army that Marsh had\nbeen ordered to let Elend Venture steal, then bring to Fadrex. The army that Ruin had eventually stolen\nback.\nAnd now Marsh waited in the ash.\nWhat is the point? he thought. His master wanted something . . . needed something . . . and he feared\nVin. Those two things gave Marsh hope, but what could he do? Even in Ruin's moment of weakness,\nMarsh had been unable to take control.\nMarsh's plan—to wait, keeping the rebellious sliver of himself secret until the right moment, then pull\nout the spike in his back and kill himself—seemed increasingly foolish. How could he hope to break free,\neven for that long?\nStand.\nThe command came wordlessly, but Marsh reacted instantly. And Ruin was back, controlling his\nbody. With effort, Marsh retained some small control of his mind, though only because Ruin seemed\ndistracted. Marsh started dropping coins, Pushing off them, using and reusing them in the same way Vin\nused horseshoes. Horseshoes—which had far more metal—would have been better, for they would have\nlet him Push farther with each one. But, he made coins work.\nHe propelled himself through the late-afternoon sky. The red air was unpleasantly abrasive, so\ncrowded with ash. Marsh watched it, trying to keep himself from seeing beauty in the destruction without\nalerting Ruin that he wasn't completely dominated.\nIt was difficult.\nAfter some time—after night had long since fallen—Ruin commanded Marsh to the ground.

He\ndescended quickly, robes flapping, and landed atop a short hill. The ash came up to his waist, and he\nwas probably standing on a few feet of packed ash underneath.\nIn the distance, down the slope, a solitary figure pushed resolutely through the ash. The man wore a\npack and led an exhausted horse.\nWho is this? Marsh thought, looking closer. The man had the build of a soldier, with a square face\nand balding head, his jaw bearing several days' worth of beard. Whoever he was, he had an impressive\ndetermination. Few people would brave the mists—yet this man not only walked through them, but\nforged his way through ash that was as high as his chest. The man's uniform was stained black, as was his\nskin. Dark . . . ashen . . .\nBeautiful.\nMarsh launched himself from the hilltop, hurling through the mist and ash on a Push of steel. The man\nbelow must have heard him coming, for he spun, reaching anxiously for the sword at his side.\nMarsh landed atop the horse's back. The creature cried out, rearing, and Marsh jumped, placing one\nfoot on the beast's face as he flipped over it and landed in the ash. The soldier had worn a path straight\nahead, and Marsh felt as if he were looking down a tight, black corridor.\nThe man whipped his sword free. The horse whinnied nervously, stamping in the ash.\nMarsh smiled, and pulled an obsidian axe from the sheath by his side. The soldier backed away, trying\nto clear room in the ash for a fight. Marsh saw the worry in the man's eyes, the dreadful anticipation.\nThe horse whinnied again. Marsh spun and sheared off its front legs, causing it to scream in pain.\nBehind, the soldier moved. And—surprisingly—instead of running, he attacked.\nThe man rammed his sword through Marsh's back. It hit a spike, veering to the side, but still impaled\nhim. Marsh turned, smiling, and tapped healing to keep himself standing.\nThe man kept moving, reaching up for Marsh's back, obviously intending to try and pull free the back\nspike. Marsh burned pewter, however, and spun out of the way, ripping away the soldier's weapon.\nShould have let him grab it . . . the free sliver said, struggling, yet useless.\nMarsh swung for the man's head, intending to take it off with a single sweep of the axe, but the soldier\nrolled in the ash, whipping a dagger from his boot and swiping in an attempt to hamstring Marsh. A clever\nmove, which would have left Marsh on the ground, healing power or not.\nHowever, Marsh tapped speed. He suddenly moved several times faster than a normal person, and he\neasily dodged the slice, instead planting a kick in the soldier's chest.\nThe man grunted as his ribs cracked. He fell in the ash, rolling and coughing, blood on his lips. He\ncame to a stop, covered in ash. Weakly, he reached for his pocket.\nAnother dagger? Marsh thought.

Marsh raised the axe again, and this time took off the man's head.\nHe didn't stop, however, the blood fury driving him to slam his axe into the corpse over and over\nagain. In the back of his head, he could feel Ruin exulting in the death—yet, he could also sense\nfrustration. Ruin tried to pull him away from the killing, to make him grab that slip of metal, but in the grip\nof the bloodlust, Marsh couldn't be controlled. Just like koloss.\nCouldn't be controlled. . . .

Then, was it the metal that stopped Ruin?\nHe had the flap of metal unfolded. There were indeed words scratched into its inside surface. Marsh\ntried to resist reading the words. In fact, he longed to grab his axe from where it had fallen dripping blood\nin the ash, then use it to kill himself. But, he couldn't manage. He didn't even have enough freedom to\ndrop the letter.

That, indeed, is likely how Zane got his spike.\n70\n\"I STILL DON'T SEE what good this does,\" Yomen said, walking beside Elend as they passed\nFadrex's gate.\nElend ignored the comment, waving a greeting to a group of soldiers. He stopped beside another\ngroup—not his, but Yomen's—and inspected their weapons. He gave them a few words of\nencouragement, then moved on. Yomen watched quietly, walking at Elend's side as an equal, not a\ncaptured king.\nThe two had an uneasy truce, but the field of koloss outside was more than enough of a motivation to\nkeep them working together. Elend had the larger army of the two, but not by much—and they were\ngrowing increasingly outnumbered as more and more koloss arrived.\n\"We should be working on the sanitation problem,\" Yomen continued once they were out of the men's\nearshot. \"An army exists on two principles: health and food. Provide those two things, and you will be\nvictorious.\"\nElend smiled, recognizing the reference. Trentison's Supplying in Scale. A few years earlier, he would\nhave agreed with Yomen, and the two would probably have spent the afternoon discussing the\nphilosophy of leadership in Yomen's palace. However, Elend had learned things in the last few years that\nhe simply hadn't been able to get from his studies.\nUnfortunately, that meant he really couldn't explain them to Yomen—particularly not in the time they\nhad. So, instead, he nodded down the street. \"We can move on to the infirmary now, if you wish, Lord\nYomen.\"\nYomen nodded, and the two turned toward another section of the city. The obligator had a\nno-nonsense approach to just about everything. Problems should be dealt with quickly and directly. He"

Problems should be dealt with quickly and directly. He\nhad a good mind, despite his fondness for making snap judgments.\nAs they walked, Elend was careful to keep an eye out for soldiers—on duty or off—in the streets. He\nnodded to their salutes, met their eyes. Many were working to repair the damages caused by the\nincreasingly powerful earthquakes. Perhaps it was just in Elend's mind, but it seemed that the soldiers\nwalked a little taller after he passed.\nYomen frowned slightly as he watched Elend do this. The obligator still wore the robes of his station,\ndespite the little bead of atium at his brow that he used to mark his kingship. The tattoos on the man's\nforehead almost seemed to curl toward the bead, as if they had been designed with it in mind.\n\"You don't know much about leading soldiers, do you, Yomen?\" Elend asked.\nThe obligator raised an eyebrow. \"I know more than you ever will about tactics, supply lines, and the\nrunning of armies between distinct points.\"\n\"Oh?\" Elend said lightly. \"So, you've read Bennitson's Armies in Motion, have you?\" The \"distinct\npoints\" line was a dead giveaway.\nYomen's frown deepened.\n\"One thing that we scholars tend to forget about, Yomen, is the impact emotion can have on a battle.\nIt isn't just about food, shoes, and clean water, necessary as those are. It's about hope, courage, and the\nwill to live. Soldiers need to know that their leader will be in the fight—if not killing enemies, then\ndirecting things personally from behind the lines. They can't think of him as an abstract force up on a\ntower somewhere, watching out a window and pondering the depths of the universe.\"\nYomen fell silent as they walked through streets that, despite being cleaned of ash, had a forlorn cast\nto them. Most of the people had retreated to the back portions of the city, where the koloss would go\nlast, if they broke through. They were camping outside, since buildings were unsafe in the quakes.\n\"You are an . . . interesting man, Elend Venture,\" Yomen finally said.\n\"I'm a bastard,\" Elend said.\nYomen raised an eyebrow.\n\"In composition, not in temperament or by birth,\" Elend said with a smile. \"I'm an amalgamation of\nwhat I've needed to be. Part scholar, part rebel, part nobleman, part Mistborn, and part soldier.\nSometimes, I don't even know myself. I had a devil of a time getting all those pieces to work together.\nAnd, just when I'm starting to get it figured out, the world up and ends on me. Ah, here we are.\"\nYomen's infirmary was a converted Ministry building—which, in Elend's opinion, showed that Yomen\nwas willing to be flexible. His religious buildings weren't so sacred to him that he couldn't acknowledge\nthat they were the best facilities for taking care of the sick and wounded. Inside, they found physicians\ntending those who had survived the initial clash with the koloss.

Yomen bustled off to speak with the\ninfirmary bureaucrats—apparently, he was worried about the number of infections that the men had\nsuffered. Elend walked over to the section with the most serious cases, and began visiting them, offering\nencouragement.\nIt was tough work, looking at the soldiers who had suffered because of his foolishness. How could he\nhave missed seeing that Ruin could take the koloss back? It made so much sense. And yet, Ruin had\nplayed its hand well—it had misled Elend, making him think that the Inquisitors were controlling the\nkoloss. Making him feel the koloss could be counted on.\nWhat would have happened, he thought, if I'd attacked this city with them as originally planned?\nRuin would have ransacked Fadrex, slaughtering everyone inside, and then turned the koloss on Elend's\nsoldiers. Now the fortifications defended by Elend and Yomen's men had given Ruin enough pause to\nmake it build up its forces before attacking.\nI have doomed this city, Elend thought, sitting beside the bed of a man who had lost his arm to a\nkoloss blade.\nIt frustrated him. He knew he'd made the right decision. And, in truth, he'd rather be inside the\ncity—almost certainly doomed—than be outside besieging it, and winning. For he knew that the winning\nside wasn't always the right side.\nStill, it came back to his continuing frustration at his inability to protect his people. And, despite\nYomen's rule of Fadrex, Elend considered its people to be his people. He'd taken the Lord Ruler's\nthrone, named himself emperor. The entirety of the Final Empire was his to care for. What good was a\nruler who couldn't even protect one city, let alone an empire full of them?\nA disturbance at the front of the infirmary room caught his attention. He cast aside his dark thoughts,\nthen bid farewell to the soldier. He rushed to the front of the hospital, where Yomen had already\nappeared to see what the ruckus was about. A woman stood holding a young boy, who was shaking\nuncontrollably with the fits.\nOne of the physicians rushed forward, taking the boy. \"Mistsickness?\" he asked.\nThe woman, weeping, nodded. \"I kept him inside until today. I knew! I knew that it wanted him! Oh,\nplease . . .\"\nYomen shook his head as the physician took the boy to a bed. \"You should have listened to me,\nwoman,\" he said firmly. \"Everyone in the city was to have been exposed to the mists. Now your son will\ntake a bed that we may need for wounded soldiers.\"\nThe woman slumped down, still crying. Yomen sighed, though Elend could see the concern in the\nman's eyes. Yomen was not a heartless man, just a pragmatic one. In addition, his words made sense. It\nwas no use hiding someone inside all of their lives, just because of the possibility that they might fall to the\nmists.\nFall to the mists . . . Elend thought idly, glancing at the boy in bed. He had stopped convulsing,\nthough his face was twisted in an expression of pain. It looked like he hurt so much. Elend had only hurt"

Elend had only hurt\nthat much once in his life.\nWe never did figure out what this mistsickness was all about, he thought. The mist spirit had never\nreturned to him. But, perhaps Yomen knew something.\n\"Yomen,\" he said, walking up to the man, distracting him from his discussion with the surgeons. \"Did\nany of your people ever figure out the reason for the mist-sickness?\"\n\"Reason?\" Yomen asked. \"Does there need to be a reason for a sickness?\"\n\"There does for one this strange,\" Elend said. \"Did you realize that it strikes down exactly sixteen\npercent of the population? Sixteen percent—to the man.\"\nInstead of being surprised, Yomen just shrugged. \"Makes sense.\"\n\"Sense?\" Elend asked.\n\"Sixteen is a powerful number, Venture,\" Yomen said, looking over some reports. \"It was the number\nof days it took the Lord Ruler to reach the Well of Ascension, for instance. It figures prominently in\nChurch doctrine.\"\nOf course, Elend thought. Yomen wouldn't be surprised to find order in nature—he believes in a\ngod who ordered that nature.\n\"Sixteen . . .\" Elend said, glancing at the sick boy.\n\"The number of original Inquisitors,\" Yomen said. \"The number of Precepts in each Canton charter.\nThe number of Allomantic metals. The—\"\n\"Wait,\" Elend said, looking up. \"What?\"\n\"Allomantic metals,\" Yomen said.\n\"There are only fourteen of those.\"\nYomen shook his head. \"Fourteen we know of, assuming your lady was right about the metal paired to\naluminum. However, fourteen is not a number of power. Allomantic metals come in sets of two, with\ngroupings of four. It seems likely that there are two more we haven't discovered, bringing the number to\nsixteen. Two by two by two by two. Four physical metals, four mental metals, four enhancement metals,\nand four temporal metals.\"\nSixteen metals . . .\nElend glanced at the boy again. Pain. Elend had known such pain once—the day his father had\nordered him beaten. Beaten to give him such pain that he thought he might die. Beaten to bring his body\nto a point near death, so that he would Snap.\nBeaten to discover if he was an Allomancer.\nLord Ruler! Elend thought with shock. He dashed away from Yomen, pushing back into the soldiers'\nsection of the infirmary.\n\"Who here was taken by the mists?\" Elend demanded.\nThe wounded regarded him with quizzical looks.\n\"Did any of you get sick?\" Elend asked. \"When I made you stand out in the mists? Please, I must\nknow!\"\nSlowly, the man with one arm raised his remaining hand. \"I was taken, my lord. I'm sorry. This wound\nis probably punishment for—\"\nElend cut the man off, rushing forward, pulling out his spare metal vial. \"Drink this,\" he commanded.\nThe man paused, then did as asked. Elend knelt beside the bed eagerly, waiting. His heart pounded in\nhis chest. \"Well?\" he finally asked.\n\"Well . . . what, my lord?\" the soldier asked.\n\"Do you feel anything?\" Elend asked."

I don't know what to make of that.\"\n\"Burn it,\" Elend said, turning on his bronze. \"Your body knows how, if you let it.\"\nThe soldier's frown deepened, and he cocked his head. Then, he began to thump with Allomantic\npower.\nElend closed his eyes again, exhaling softly.\nYomen was walking up behind Elend. \"What is this?\"\n\"The mists were never our enemy, Yomen,\" Elend said, eyes still closed. \"They were just trying to\nhelp.\"\n\"Help? Help how? What are you talking about?\"\nElend opened his eyes, turning. \"They weren't killing us, Yomen. They weren't making us sick. They\nwere Snapping us. Bringing us power. Making us able to fight.\"\n\"My lord!\" a voice suddenly called. Elend turned as a frazzled soldier stumbled into the room. \"My\nlords! The koloss are attacking! They're charging the city!\"\nElend felt a start. Ruin. It knows what I just discovered—it knows it needs to attack now, rather\nthan wait for more troops.\nBecause I know the secret!\n\"Yomen, gather every bit of powdered metal you can find in this city!\" Elend yelled. \"Pewter, tin, steel,\nand iron! Get it to anyone who has been stricken by the mists! Make them drink it down!\"\n\"Why?\" Yomen said, still confused.\nElend turned, smiling. \"Because they are now Allomancers. This city isn't going to fall as easily as\neveryone assumed. If you need me, I'll be on the front lines!\"\nThere is something special about the number sixteen. For one thing, it was Preservation's sign to\nmankind.\nPreservation knew, even before he imprisoned Ruin, that he wouldn't be able to communicate\nwith humankind once he diminished himself. And so, he left clues—clues that couldn't be altered\nby Ruin. Clues that related back to the fundamental laws of the universe. The number was meant\nto be proof that something unnatural was happening, and that there was help to be found.\nIt may have taken us long to figure this out, but when we eventually did understand the\nclue—late though it was—it provided a much-needed boost.\nAs for the other aspects of the number . . . well, even I am still investigating that. Suffice it to\nsay that it has great ramifications regarding how the world, and the universe itself, works.\n71\nSAZED TAPPED HIS PEN against the metal paper, frowning slightly. \"Very little of this last chunk is\ndifferent from what I knew before,\" he said. \"Ruin changed small things—perhaps to keep me from\nnoticing the alterations. It's obvious that he wanted to make me realize that Vin was the Hero of Ages.\"\n\"He wanted her to release him,\" said Haddek, leader of the First Generation. His companions nodded."

His companions nodded.\n\"Perhaps she was never the Hero,\" one of the others offered.\nSazed shook his head. \"I believe that she is. These prophecies still refer to her—even the unaltered\nones that you have told me. They talk of one who is separate from the Terris people, a king of men, a\nrebel caught between two worlds. Ruin just emphasized that Vin was the one, since he wanted her to\ncome and free him.\"\n\"We always assumed that the Hero would be a man,\" Haddek said in his wheezing voice.\n\"So did everyone else,\" Sazed said. \"But, you said yourself that all the prophecies use gender-neutral\npronouns. That had to be intentional—one does not use such language in old Terris by accident. The\nneutral case was chosen so that we wouldn't know whether the Hero was male or female.\"\nSeveral of the ancient Terrismen nodded. They worked by the quiet blue light of the glowing stones,\nstill sitting in the chamber with the metal walls—which, from what Sazed had been able to gather, was\nsomething of a holy place for the kandra.\nHe tapped his pen, frowning. What was bothering him? They say I will hold the future of the entire\nworld on my arms. . . . Alendi's words, from his logbook written so long ago. The words of the First\nGeneration confirmed that was true.\nThere was still something for Vin to do. Yet, the power at the Well of Ascension was gone. Used up.\nHow could she fight without it? Sazed looked up at his audience of ancient kandra. \"What was the\npower at the Well of Ascension, anyway?\"\n\"Even we are not certain of that, young one,\" Haddek said. \"By the time we lived as men, our gods\nhad already passed from this world, leaving the Terris with only the hope of the Hero.\"\n\"Tell me of this thing,\" Sazed said, leaning forward. \"How did your gods pass from this world?\"\n\"Ruin and Preservation,\" said one of the others. \"They created our world, and our people.\"\n\"Neither could create alone,\" Haddek said. \"No, they could not. For, to preserve something is not to\ncreate it—and neither can you create through destruction only.\"\nIt was a common theme in mythology—Sazed had read it in dozens of the religions he'd studied. The\nworld being created out of a clash between two forces, sometimes rendered as chaos and order,\nsometimes named destruction and protection. That bothered him a little bit. He was hoping to discover\nsomething new in the things men were telling him.\nAnd yet . . . just because something was common, did that make it false? Or, could all of those\nmythologies have a shared, and true, root?\n\"They created the world,\" Sazed said. \"Then left?\"\n\"Not immediately,\" Haddek said. \"But, here is the trick, young one. They had a deal, those two.\nPreservation wanted to create men—to create life capable of emotion. He obtained a promise from Ruin\nto help make men.\"\n\"But at a cost,\" one of the others whispered.\n\"What cost?\" Sazed asked."

It was one that Sazed himself had witnessed in\nthe birth of the Church of the Survivor.\nYet . . . this time it's my own religion, he thought. He frowned, leaning back, trying to decide how he\nfelt. For some reason, he had assumed that the truth would be different. The scholarly side of him\nargued with his desire for belief. How could he believe in something so filled with mythological clichés?\nHe'd come all this way, believing that he'd been given one last chance to find the truth. Yet, now that\nhe studied it, he was finding that it was shockingly similar to religions he had rejected as false.\n\"You seem disturbed, child,\" Haddek said. \"Are you that worried about the things we say?\"\n\"I apologize,\" Sazed said. \"This is a personal problem, not related to the fate of the Hero of Ages.\"\n\"Please, speak,\" one of the others said.\n\"It is complicated,\" Sazed said. \"For some time now, I have been searching through the religions of\nmankind, trying to ascertain which of their teachings were true. I had begun to despair that I would ever\nfind a religion that offered the answers I sought. Then, I learned that my own religion still existed,\nprotected by the kandra. I came here, hoping to find the truth.\"\n\"This is the truth,\" one of the kandra said.\n\"That's what every religion teaches,\" Sazed said, frustration mounting. \"Yet, in each of them I find\ninconsistencies, logical leaps, and demands of faith I find impossible to accept.\n\"It sounds to me, young one,\" Haddek said, \"that you're searching for something that cannot be found.\"\n\"The truth?\" Sazed said.\n\"No,\" Haddek replied. \"A religion that requires no faith of its believers.\"\nAnother of the kandra elders nodded. \"We follow the Father and the First Contract, but our faith is\nnot in him. It's in . . . something higher. We trust that Preservation planned for this day, and that his desire\nto protect will prove more powerful than Ruin's desire to destroy.\"\n\"But you don't know,\" Sazed said. \"You are offered proof only once you believe, but if you believe,\nyou can find proof in anything. It is a logical conundrum.\"\n\"Faith isn't about logic, son,\" Haddek said. \"Perhaps that's your problem. You cannot 'disprove' the\nthings you study, any more than we can prove to you that the Hero will save us. We simply must believe\nit, and accept the things Preservation has taught us.\"\nIt wasn't enough for Sazed. However, for the moment, he decided to move on. He didn't have all the\nfacts about the Terris religion yet. Perhaps once he had them, he would be able to sort this all out."

Much more of it, at least, than that of Preservation.\"\n\"But not all of it,\" another one said, laughing.\nSazed cocked his head. \"Not all of it? It, too, was spread out across the world, I assume?\"\n\"In a way,\" Haddek said.\n\"We now speak of things in the First Contract,\" one of the other kandra warned.\nHaddek paused, then turned, studying Sazed's eyes. \"If what this man says is true, then Ruin has\nescaped.

With hands now thick with muscles, he reached down and—bracing himself against the rough\nfloor—shoved against one side of the disk on the floor.\nIt ground against stone as it moved, uncovering a large pit. Something glittered beneath.\nSazed froze, his strength—and body—deflating as he released his pewtermind. His robes became\nloose again. The room was silent. Sazed stared at the half-covered pit, and at the enormous pile of\nnuggets hidden in the floor.\n\"The Trust, we call it,\" Haddek said with a soft voice. \"Given for our safekeeping by the Father.\"\nAtium. Thousands upon thousands of beads of it. Sazed gasped. \"The Lord Ruler's atium stockpile . . .\nIt was here all along.\"\n\"Most of that atium never left the Pits of Hathsin,\" Haddek said. \"There were obligators on staff at all\ntimes—but never Inquisitors, for the Father knew that they could be corrupted.

Every one of them, even aluminum and duralumin, could be mined or created through\nnatural processes. Atium, however—it had only ever come from a single place, its appearance\nmysterious and strange.

The landscape before him was burning.\nTyrian, closest of the ashmounts to Luthadel, stood in the near distance, half of its top blown free from\nsome violent eruption. The air itself seemed to burn with tongues of flame, and the broad plain in front of\nTenSoon was clogged with flowing lava. It was a deep, powerful red. Even from a distance, he could feel\nthe heat pushing against him.\nHe stood for a long moment, deep in ash, gazing upon a landscape that had once contained villages,\nforests, and roads. All was now gone, burnt away. The earth had cracked in the distance, and more lava\nseemed to be spilling out of it.\nBy the First Contract, he thought with despair. He could detour to the south, continue on to Fadrex\nas if he'd come in a straight line from Luthadel, but for some reason, he found it hard to get up the\nmotivation.\nIt was too late.\nYes, there are sixteen metals. I find it highly unlikely that the Lord Ruler did not know of them all.\nIndeed, the fact that he spoke of several on the plates in the storage caches meant that he knew at\nleast of those.\nI must assume that he did not tell mankind of them earlier for a reason. Perhaps he held them\nback to give him a secret edge, much as he kept back the single nugget of Preservation's body\nthat made men into Mistborn."

Some things we shall never know. Part of me still finds what he did regrettable.\nDuring the thousand-year reign of the Lord Ruler, how many people were born, Snapped, lived,\nand died never knowing that they were Mistings, simply because their metals were unknown?\nOf course, this did give us a slight advantage, at the end. Ruin had a lot of trouble giving\nduralumin to his Inquisitors, since they'd need an Allomancer who could burn it to kill before they\ncould use it. And, since none of the duralumin Mistings in the world knew about their power, they\ndidn't burn it and reveal themselves to Ruin. That left most Inquisitors without the power of\nduralumin, save in a few important cases—such as Marsh—where they got it from a Mistborn.\nThis was usually considered a waste, for if one killed a Mistborn with Hemalurgy, one could draw\nout only one of their sixteen powers and lost the rest. Ruin considered it much better to try to\nsubvert them and gain access to all of their power.\n72\nIT BEGAN RAINING just before Vin reached Luthadel. A quiet, cold drizzle that wetted the night,\nbut did not banish the mists.\nShe flared her bronze. In the distance, she could sense Allomancers. Mistborn. Chasing her. There\nwere at least a dozen of them, homing in on her position.\nShe landed on the city wall, bare feet slipping just slightly on the stones. Beyond her stretched\nLuthadel, even now proud in its sprawl. Founded a thousand years before by the Lord Ruler, it was built\natop the Well of Ascension itself. During the ten centuries of his reign, Luthadel had burgeoned,\nbecoming the most important—and most crowded—place in all of the empire.\nAnd it was dying.\nVin stood up straight, looking out over the vast city. Pockets of flame flared where buildings had\ncaught fire. The flames defied the rain, illuminating the various slums and other neighborhoods like watch\nfires in the night. In their light, she could see that the city was a wreck. Entire swathes of the town had\nbeen torn apart, the buildings broken or burned. The streets were eerily vacant—nobody fought the fires,\nnobody huddled in the gutters.\nThe capital, once home to hundreds of thousands, seemed empty. Wind blew through Vin's\nrain-wetted hair and she felt a shiver. The mists, as usual, stayed away from her—pushed aside by her\nAllomancy. She was alone in the largest city in the world.\nNo. Not alone. She could feel them approaching—Ruin's minions. She had led them here, made them\nassume that she was bringing them to the atium. There would be far more of them than she could fight.\nShe was doomed.\nThat was the idea.\nShe launched off the wall, shooting through the mist, ash, and rain. She wore her mistcloak, more out\nof nostalgia than utility. It was the same one she'd always had—the one that Kelsier had given her on her"

A part of her still thought she should have died that night.\nShe landed on the street, then stood upright, her tasseled mistcloak falling around her, hiding her arms\nand chest. She stood quietly, looking up at Kredik Shaw, the Hill of a Thousand Spires. The Lord\nRuler's palace, location of the Well of Ascension.\nThe building was an assemblage of several low wings topped by dozens of rising towers, spires, and\nspines. The awful near-symmetry of the amalgamation was only made more unsettling by the presence of\nthe mists and ash. The building had been abandoned since the Lord Ruler's death. The doors were\nbroken, and she could see shattered windows in the walls. Kredik Shaw was as dead as the city it once\nhad dominated.\nA figure stepped up beside her. \"Here?\" Ruin said. \"This is where you lead me? We have searched this\nplace.\"\nVin remained quiet, looking up at the spires. Black fingers of metal reaching up into a blacker sky.\n\"My Inquisitors are coming,\" Ruin whispered.\n\"You shouldn't have revealed yourself,\" Vin said, not looking toward him. \"You should have waited\nuntil I retrieved the atium. I'll never do it now.\"\n\"Ah, but I no longer believe that you have it,\" Ruin said in his fatherly voice. \"Child . . . child. I\nbelieved you at first—indeed, I gathered my powers, ready to face you. When you came here, however,\nI knew that you had misled me.\"\n\"You don't know that for certain,\" Vin said softly, voice complemented by the quiet rain.\nSilence. \"No,\" Ruin finally said.\n\"Then you'll have to try to make me talk,\" she whispered.\n\"Try? You realize the forces I can bring to bear against you, child? You realize the power I have, the\ndestruction I represent? I am mountains that crush. I am waves that crash. I am storms that shatter. I am\nthe end.\"\nVin continued to stare up into the falling rain. She didn't question her plan—it wasn't really her way.\nShe'd decided what to do. It was time to spring Ruin's trap.\nShe was tired of being manipulated.\n\"You will never have it,\" Vin said. \"Not while I live.\"\nRuin screamed, a sound of primal anger, of something that had to destroy. Then, he vanished.\nLightning flared, its light a wave of power moving through the mist. It illuminated robed figures in the\nblackened rain, walking toward her. Surrounding her.\nVin turned toward a ruined building a short distance away, watching as a figure climbed up over the\nrubble.

Marsh appeared to have\nupward of twenty. He growled softly.\nAnd the fight began.\nVin flung back her cloak, spraying water from the tassels, and Pushed herself forward. Thirteen\nInquisitors hurtled through the night sky toward her. Vin ducked a flight of axe swings, then slammed a\nPush toward a pair of Inquisitors, burning duralumin. The creatures were thrown backward by their\nspikes, and Vin accelerated in a sudden lurch to the side.\nShe hit another Inquisitor, feet against his chest. Water sprayed, flecked with ash, as Vin reached\ndown and grabbed one of the spikes in the Inquisitor's eyes. Then she Pulled herself backward and flared\npewter.\nShe lurched, and the spike came free. The Inquisitor screamed, but did not fall dead. It looked at her,\none side of the head a gaping hole, and hissed. Removing one eye-spike, apparently, wasn't enough to\nkill.\nRuin laughed in her head.\nThe spikeless Inquisitor reached for her, and Vin Pulled herself into the sky, yanking on one of the\nmetal spires of Kredik Shaw. She downed the contents of a metal vial as she flew, restoring her steel.\nA dozen figures in black robes sprang up through the falling rain to follow. Marsh remained below,\nwatching.\nVin gritted her teeth, then whipped out a pair of daggers and Pushed herself back down—directly\ntoward the Inquisitors. She passed among them, surprising several, who had probably expected her to\njump away. She slammed directly into the creature she'd pulled the spike from, spinning him in the air,\nramming her daggers into his chest. He gritted his teeth, laughing, then slapped her arms apart and kicked\nher back toward the ground.\nShe fell with the rain.\nVin hit hard, but managed to land on her feet. The Inquisitor hit the cobblestones back-first, her\ndaggers still in his chest. But he stood up easily, tossing the daggers aside, shattering them on the\ncobblestones.\nThen he moved suddenly. Too quickly. Vin didn't have time to think as he splashed through the misty\nrain, grabbing her by the throat.\nI've seen that speed before, she thought as she struggled. Not just from Inquisitors. From Sazed.\nThat's a Feruchemical power. Just like the strength Marsh used earlier.\nThat was the reason for the new spikes. These other Inquisitors didn't have as many as Marsh, but\nthey obviously had some new powers. Strength. Speed. Each of these creatures was, essentially, another\nLord Ruler.\nYou see? Ruin asked.\nVin cried out, duralumin-Pushing against the Inquisitor, tearing herself out of his grasp. The move left\nher throat bleeding from his fingernails, and she had to down another vial of metals—her last—to restore\nher steel as she hydroplaned across the wet ground."

The Inquisitor screamed and fell. Vin pushed herself to her feet with one hand, then\nPulled on the spires up above, throwing herself up about ten feet to dodge the multitude of swings that\ncame after her.\nShe landed back on the ground, grabbing the handle of the fallen Inquisitor's axe. She swung it up,\nspraying water, her skin stained with wet ash as she blocked a blow.\nYou cannot fight, Vin, Ruin said. Each blow only helps me. I am Ruin.\nShe screamed, throwing herself forward in a reckless attack, shouldering aside one Inquisitor, then\nslamming her axe into the side of another. They growled and swung, but she stayed a step ahead, barely\ndodging their attacks. The one she had knocked down stood back up, his knees healed.

The twelve Inquisitors followed like a flock of ravens, leaping\nbetween spires, robes flapping, taking different paths than she.

She tried to pull herself up to grab one of Marsh's\nspikes, but he snatched her leg—the broken one—and her own effort just made her scream in agony.\nNow, Ruin said in his kindly voice, we will begin.

Shunning her like a victim of the plague.\nIt was the same way the mists treated the Inquisitors.\nThe creatures rose, surrounding her, silhouettes in the dark night. Marsh yanked her back to him, then\nreached for her arm. She heard her bone snap before she felt the pain. It came, however, and she\nscreamed.\nIt had been a long time since she'd known torture. The streets had not been kind, but during the last\nfew years, she'd been able to repress most of those experiences. She'd become a Mistborn. Powerful.\nProtected.\nNot this time, she realized through the haze of agony. Sazed won't come for me this time. Kelsier\nwon't save me. Even the mists have abandoned me. I'm alone.\nHer teeth began to chatter, and Marsh raised her other arm. He looked down at her with spiked eyes,\nexpression unreadable.

If only Ruin weren't holding him back. Then he could kill her. He strained against his bonds, lusting to\ndo her more harm.\nNo . . . a tiny piece of him thought.\nThe rain fell, marking a beautiful night.

He smiled, the passionate love of a fresh kill rising in him.\nNo, he thought.\nHe knew, somehow, that the end was very near. The ground trembled beneath his feet, and he had to\nsteady himself with one hand before continuing his work, snapping Vin's other leg. The final day had\narrived. The world would not survive this night. He laughed gleefully, fully in the throes of a blood frenzy,\nbarely controlled as he broke Vin's body.\nNO!\nMarsh awakened. Though his hands still moved as ordered, his mind rebelled. He took in the ash, and\nthe rain, the blood and the soot, and it disgusted him. Vin lay nearly dead.\nKelsier treated her like a daughter, he thought as he broke her fingers, one at a time. She was\nscreaming. The daughter he never had with Mare.\nI've given up. Just like I did with the rebellion.\nIt was the great shame of his life. Years ago, before the Collapse, he had led the skaa rebellion. But,\nhe'd given in. He'd withdrawn, giving up leadership of the group. And he'd done it only one year before\nthe rebellion—with Kelsier's help—finally overthrew the Final Empire. Marsh had been its leader, but\nhad given up. Just before the victory.\nNo, he thought as he broke the fingers on her other hand. Not again. No more giving up!"

It was black.\nPlease, she thought, reaching out to the mists with one final plea. They felt so familiar all of a sudden.\nWhere had she felt that feeling before? Where did she know them?\nFrom the Well of Ascension, of course, a voice whispered in her head. It's the same power, after\nall. Solid in the metal you fed to Elend. Liquid in the pool you burned. And vapor in the air,\nconfined to night. Hiding you. Protecting you.\nGiving you power!\nVin gasped, drawing in breath—a breath that sucked in the mists. She felt suddenly warm, the mists\nsurging within her, lending her their strength. Her entire body burned like metal, and the pain disappeared\nin a flash.\nMarsh swung his axe for her head, spraying water.\nAnd she caught his arm.\nI have spoken of Inquisitors, and their ability to pierce copperclouds.

Even\nthe Blessing of Potency could only do so much.\nHe stood, forcing his horse's body to rise, looking at his nighttime surroundings. Endless fields of ash\nextended behind him; even the track he had worn up to the top of the hill was close to being filled in. The\nlava burned ahead of him. However, something seemed different. What?\nThe mists flowed, moving about, swirling. Generally, the mists had a very chaotic pattern. Some parts\nwould flow one way, while others would spin about in other directions. There were often rivers of\nmotion, but they never conformed to one another. Most often, they followed the wind; this night the wind\nwas still.\nAnd yet, the mist seemed to be flowing in one direction. As soon as he noticed it, TenSoon found it\none of the most singularly strange sights he had ever beheld. Instead of swirling or spinning, the mists\nmoved together in a seemingly purposeful flow. They coursed around him, and he felt like a stone in a\nhuge, incorporeal river.\nThe mists flowed toward Luthadel. Perhaps I'm not too late! he thought, regaining some of his hope.\nHe shook himself from his stupor, and took off in a gallop back the way he had come.\n\"Breezy, come look at this.\"\nBreeze rubbed his eyes, looking across the room to where Allrianne sat in her nightgown, looking out\nthe window. It was late—too late. He should have been asleep.\nHe looked back toward his desk, and the treaty he had been working on. It was the sort of thing\nSazed or Elend should have had to write, not Breeze. \"You know,\" he said, \"I distinctly remember telling\nKelsier that I did not want to end up in charge of anything important. Running kingdoms and cities is\nwork for fools, not thieves! Government is far too inefficient to provide a suitable income.\"\n\"Breezy!\" Allrianne said insistently, Pulling on his emotions quite blatantly.\nHe sighed, rising. \"Very well,\" he grumbled. Honestly, he thought. How is it, of all the qualified\npeople in Kelsier's little crew, that I end up the one leading a city?\nHe joined Allrianne at the window, peeking out. \"What is it exactly I'm supposed to see, dear? I don't\n. . .\"\nHe trailed off, frowning. Beside him, Allrianne touched his arm, seeming concerned as she looked out\nthe window."

He closed his eyes, fatigue making his body shake despite his pewter. \"I don't\nreally care about mists right now, Ham,\" he whispered. \"I can barely think straight.\"\nHam grunted in agreement. Around them, men screamed and died, fighting the endless waves of\nkoloss. They had some of the creatures bottled up in the natural stone corridor leading into Fadrex, but\nthe real fights were happening on the rugged rock formations that enclosed the city. Too many koloss,\ntired of waiting outside, had begun crawling up to attack from the sides.\nIt was a precarious battlefield, one that often demanded Elend's attention. They had a large number of\nAllomancers, but most of them were inexperienced—they hadn't even known about their powers until\nthis very day. Elend was a oneman reserve force, bounding across the defensive lines, plugging holes\nwhile Cett directed tactics below.\nMore screams. More death. More metal hitting metal, rock, and flesh. Why? Elend thought with\nfrustration. Why can't I protect them? He flared pewter, taking a deep breath and standing up in the\nnight.\nThe mists flowed overhead, as if pulled by some invisible force. For a moment, even exhausted as he\nwas, he froze.\n\"Lord Venture!\" someone shouted. Elend spun, looking toward the sound. A youthful messenger\nscrambled up the side of the rock outcropping, wide-eyed.\nOh, no . . . Elend thought, tensing.\n\"My lord, they're retreating!\" the lad said, stumbling to a halt before Elend.\n\"What?\" Ham asked, standing.\n\"It's true, my lord. They pulled back from the city gates! They're leaving.\"\nElend immediately dropped a coin, shooting himself into the sky. Mist flowed around him, its tendrils a\nmillion tiny strings being yanked eastward. Below, he saw the hulking, dark forms of the koloss running\naway in the night.\nSo many of them, he thought, landing on a rock formation. We'd never have beaten them. Even\nwith Allomancers."

She felt as if the bleeding sun itself blazed within her, running molten through her\nveins.\nHer every Steelpush or Ironpull slammed against her as if it were made with the power of duralumin.\nYet, the metal reserves within her did not vanish. Instead, they grew stronger. Vaster. She wasn't certain\nwhat was happening to her. However, she did know one thing.\nSuddenly, fighting twelve Inquisitors at once did not seem like an impossible task.\nShe cried out, slapping an Inquisitor to the side, then ducking a pair of axes. She crouched, then\njumped, leaping in an arc through the rain, coming down beside Marsh, who still lay stunned from where\nshe had thrown him after her rebirth.\nHe looked up, finally seeming to focus on her, then cursed and rolled away as Vin punched\ndownward. Her fist shattered a cobblestone, throwing back a ripple of dark rainwater, splashing her\narms and face, leaving specks of black ash behind.\nShe looked up toward Marsh. He stood erect, bare-chested, his spikes glistening in the darkness.\nVin smiled, then spun on the Inquisitors rushing her from behind. She yelled, dodging a swinging axe.\nHad these creatures ever seemed quick to her? Within the embrace of limitless pewter, she seemed to\nmove as the mist itself did. Light. Quick.\nUnchained.\nThe sky spun in a tempest of its own as she attacked, moving in a swirling frenzy. The mists whirled\naround her arm in a vortex as she punched one Inquisitor in the face, throwing him backward. The mists\ndanced before her as she caught the fallen Inquisitor's axe, then sheared the arm off another of the\ncreatures. She took his head next, leaving the others stunned with the speed of her motion.\nThat's two dead.\nThey attacked again. She bounded backward, Pulling herself toward the spires above. The trail of\nravens launched after her, their robes snapping in the wet darkness. She hit a spire feet-first, then\nlaunched upward and Pulled on an Inquisitor's spikes, something that was easy to do with her new\npower. Her chosen quarry lurched upward ahead of his companions.\nVin shot downward, meeting the Inquisitor in the air. She grabbed him by the eye-spikes and pulled,\nripping them out with her newfound strength. Then she kicked off the creature and Pushed against the\nspikes in his chest.\nShe shot upward in the air, leaving a corpse flipping end over end in the rain beneath her, massive gaps\nin its head where the spikes had been. They could lose some spikes and live, she knew, but the removal\nof others was deadly. Losing both eye-spikes appeared to be enough to kill them.\nThree."

Vin smiled, then threw\nthe spikes she still carried, catching one of the Inquisitors in the chest with them. Then, she Pushed. The\nunfortunate Inquisitor was thrown downward, and he hit a flat rooftop so violently that it pushed several\nof his spikes up out of his body. They sparkled and spun in the air, then fell beside his immobile corpse.\nFour.\nVin's mistcloak fluttered as she shot upward in the sky. Eight Inquisitors still chased her, reaching for\nher. Crying out, Vin raised her hands toward the creatures as she began to fall. Then, she Pushed.\nShe hadn't realized how strong her new powers were. They were obviously akin to duralumin, since\nshe could affect the spikes inside of an Inquisitor's body. Her overpowering Push forced the whole flock\nof them downward, as if they'd been swatted. In fact, her Push also hit the metal spire directly beneath\nher.\nThe stone architecture holding the spire in place exploded, spraying chips and dust outward as the\nspire itself crushed the building beneath it. And Vin was thrown upward.\nVery quickly.\nShe blasted through the sky, mists streaking past her, the force of her Push straining even her\nmist-enhanced body with the stress of sudden acceleration.\nAnd then she was out. She emerged into the open air, like a fish leaping from the water. Beneath her,\nthe mists covered the nighttime land like an enormous white blanket. Around her, there was only open\nair. Unsettling, strange. Above her, a million stars—normally visible only to Allomancers—watched her\nlike the eyes of those long dead.\nHer momentum ran out, and she spun quietly, whiteness below, light above. She notice that she'd\ntrailed a line of mist up out of the main cloud. This hung like a tether ready to pull her back down. In fact,\nall the mists were spinning slightly in what looked like an enormous weather pattern. A whirlpool of white.\nThe heart of the whirlpool was directly beneath her.\nShe fell, plummeting back down toward the earth below. She entered the mists, drawing them behind\nher, breathing them in. Even as she fell, she could feel them surging about her in a massive, empire-wide\nspiral. She welcomed them into herself, and the vortex of mist around her grew more and more violent.\nInstants later, Luthadel appeared, a massive black welt upon the land. She fell down, streaking toward\nKredik Shaw and its spires, which seemed to be pointing toward her. The Inquisitors were still\nthere—she could see them standing on a flat rooftop amid the spires, looking up. Waiting. There were\nonly eight, not counting Marsh. One lay impaled on a nearby spike from her last push; the blow had\napparently torn the center spike out of his back.\nFive, Vin thought, landing a short distance from the Inquisitors.\nIf a single Push could throw her up so far she passed out of the mists, then what would happen if she"

She could see desperation in their movements.\nWhatever was happening to Vin, Ruin was apparently willing to risk every one of the creatures in the\nhopes that they would kill her before she was complete. Mists pulled toward her, moving more and more\nquickly, drawn into her like water being sucked down a drain.\nWhen the Inquisitors had almost reached her, she Pushed outward again, throwing metal away from\nher with all the force as she could muster, while at the same time strengthening her body with a massive\nflare of pewter. Stone cracked. Inquisitors cried out.\nAnd Kredik Shaw exploded.\nTowers toppled from their foundations. Doors ripped free from their frames. Windows shattered.\nBlocks burst, the entire structure torn to pieces as its metals lurched away. She screamed as she Pushed,\nthe ground trembling beneath her. Everything—even the rock and stone, which obviously contained\nresidual traces of metal ore—was thrown violently back.\nShe gasped, stopping her Push. She drew in breath, feeling the rain splatter against her. The building\nthat had been the Lord Ruler's palace was gone, flattened to rubble which spread out and away from her\nlike an impact crater.\nAn Inquisitor burst from the rubble, face bleeding from where one of his spikes had ripped free. Vin\nraised a hand, Pulling and steadying herself from behind. The Inquisitor's head lurched, his other\neye-spike pulling free. He toppled forward, and Vin caught the spike, Pushing it toward another\nInquisitor who was rushing her. He raised a hand to Push it back at her.\nAnd she drove it forward anyway, ignoring his Push with a quick Push backward to stabilize herself.\nHe was thrown away and slammed into the remnants of a wall. The spike continued forward, Pushed like\na fish darting through water, ignoring the current. The spike slammed into the Inquisitor's face, crushing it,\npinning his head back against the granite.\nSix and seven.\nVin stalked across the rubble, mists storming. Overhead, they swirled furiously, forming a funnel cloud\nwith her at its focus. It was like a tornado, but with no air currents. Just impalpable mists, as if painted on\nthe air. Spinning, swirling, coming to her silent command.\nShe stepped over an Inquisitor corpse that had been crushed by the rubble; she kicked his head free\nto make certain he was dead.\nEight.\nThree rushed her at once. She screamed, turning, Pulling on a fallen spire. The massive piece of\nmetal—nearly as big as a building itself—lurched into the air, spinning at her command. She slammed it\ninto the Inquisitors like a club, crushing them. She turned, leaving the enormous iron pillar resting atop\ntheir corpses.\nNine. Ten. Eleven.\nThe storm broke, though the mists continued to swirl. The rain let up as Vin walked across the\nshattered building, eyes searching for Allomantic blue lines that were moving. She found one trembling\nbefore her, and she picked up and tossed aside an enormous marble disk. An Inquisitor groaned"

An Inquisitor groaned\nbeneath; she reached for him, and realized that her hand was leaking mist. It didn't just swirl around her,\nit came from her, smoking forth from the pores in her skin. She breathed out, and mist puffed before her,\nthen immediately entered the vortex and was pulled in again.\nShe grabbed the Inquisitor, pulling him up. His skin began to heal as he used his Feruchemical powers,\nand he struggled, growing stronger. Yet, even the awesome strength of Feruchemy made little difference\nagainst Vin. She pulled his eye-spikes free, tossed them aside, then left the corpse slumping in the rubble.\nTwelve.\nShe found the last Inquisitor huddled in a pool of rainwater. It was Marsh. His body was broken, and\nhe was missing one of the spikes from his side. The spike hole was bleeding, but that one apparently\nwasn't enough to kill him. He turned his pair of spikeheads to look up at her, expression stiff.\nVin paused, breathing deeply, feeling rainwater trail down her arms and drip off her fingers. She still\nburned within, and she looked up, staring into the vortex of mists. It was spinning so powerfully, twisting\ndown. She was having trouble thinking for all the energy that coursed through her.\nShe looked down again.\nThis isn't Marsh, she thought. Kelsier's brother is long dead. This is something else. Ruin.\nThe mist swirled in a final tempest, the circular motion growing faster—yet tighter—as the final wisps\nof mist spun down and were pulled into Vin's body.\nThen the mists were gone. Starlight shone above, and flecks of ash fell in the air. The night landscape\nwas eerie in its stillness, blackness, and clarity. Even with tin—which let her see at night far better than a\nnormal person could—the mists had always been there. To see the night landscape without them was . . .\nwrong.\nVin began to tremble. She gasped, feeling the fire within her blaze hotter and hotter. It was Allomancy\nas she'd never known it. It felt as if she had never understood it. The power was far greater than metals,\nmere Pushes and Pulls. It was something awesomely more vast. A power that men had used, yet never\ncomprehended.\nShe forced her eyes open. There was one Inquisitor left. She had drawn them to Luthadel, forced\nthem to expose themselves, laying a trap for someone far more powerful than herself. And the mists had\nresponded.\nIt was time to finish what she had come to do.\nMarsh watched limply as Vin fell to her knees. Shaking, she reached for one of his eye-spikes.\nThere was nothing he could do. He'd used up most of the healing in his metal-mind, and the rest would\ndo him no good. Stored healing worked by way of speed. He could either heal himself a small amount\nvery quickly, or wait and heal himself slowly, yet completely. Either way, he was dead as soon as Vin\npulled those spikes free."

Whatever I did . . . it worked.\nSomehow.\nHe felt Ruin's rage, felt his master realizing his mistake. In the end, Marsh had mattered. In the end,\nMarsh hadn't given up. He'd done Mare proud.\nVin pulled the spike free. It hurt, of course—hurt far more than Marsh would have thought possible.\nHe screamed—both in pain and in joy—as Vin reached for the other eye-spike.\nAnd then, she hesitated. Marsh waited expectantly. She shook, then coughed, cringing. She gritted her\nteeth, reaching toward him. Her fingers touched the spike.\nAnd then, Vin vanished.\nShe left behind the misty outline of a young woman. That dissipated and was soon gone, too, leaving\nMarsh alone in the wreckage of a palace, head blazing with pain, body covered in sickly, sodden ash.\nShe once asked Ruin why he had chosen her. The primary answer is simple. It had little to do with\nher personality, attitudes, or even skill with Allomancy.\nShe was simply the only child Ruin could find who was in a position to gain the right\nHemalurgic spike—one that would grant her heightened power with bronze, which would then let\nher sense the location of the Well of Ascension. She had an insane mother, a sister who was a\nSeeker, and was—herself—Mistborn. That was precisely the combination Ruin needed.\nThere were other reasons, of course. But even Ruin didn't know them.\n74\nDAY BROKE WITH NO MISTS.\nElend stood atop the rocky heights in front of Fadrex City, looking out. He felt far better with a night's\nrest behind him, though his body ached from fighting, his arm throbbed where he'd been wounded, and\nhis chest hurt where he'd carelessly allowed a koloss to punch him. The massive bruise would have\ncrippled another man.\nKoloss corpses littered the ground before the city, piled particularly high in the corridor leading into\nFadrex itself. The whole area smelled of death and dried blood. Far more often than Elend would have\nliked, the field of blue corpses was broken by the lighter skin of a human. Still, Fadrex had survived—if\nonly because of the last-minute addition of several thousand Allomancers and the eventual retreat of the\nkoloss.\nWhy did they leave? Elend wondered, thankful yet frustrated. And, perhaps more importantly,\nwhere are they going?\nElend turned at the sound of footsteps on rock and saw Yomen climbing the rough-hewn steps to join\nhim, puffing slightly, still pristine in his obligator's robes. Nobody had expected him to fight. He was, after\nall, a scholar, and not a warrior.\nLike me, Elend thought, smiling wryly.\n\"The mists are gone,\" Yomen said.\nElend nodded. \"Both day and night.\"\n\"The skaa fled inside when the mists vanished. Some still refuse to leave their homes. For centuries,\nthey feared being out at night because of the mists. Now the mists disappear, and they find it so unnatural\nthat they hide again.\""

The mists were gone, but the ash still fell. And it fell hard. The\ncorpses that had fallen during the night hours were nearly buried.\n\"Has the sun always been this hot?\" Yomen asked, wiping his brow.\nElend frowned, noticing for the first time that it did seem hot. It was still early morning, yet it already\nfelt like noon.\nSomething is still wrong, he thought. Very wrong. Worse, even. The ash choked the air, blowing in\nthe breeze, coating everything. And the heat . . . shouldn't it have been getting colder as more ash flew\ninto the air, blocking the sunlight? \"Form crews, Yomen,\" Elend said. \"Have them pick through the bodies\nand search for wounded among that mess down there. Then, gather the people and begin moving them\ninto the storage cavern. Tell the soldiers to be ready for . . . for something. I don't know what.\"\nYomen frowned. \"You sound as if you're not going to be here to help me.\"\nElend turned eastward. \"I won't be.\"\nVin was still out there somewhere. He didn't understand why she had said what she had about the\natium, but he trusted her. Perhaps she had intended to distract Ruin with lies. Elend suspected that\nsomehow, the people of Fadrex owed her their lives. She'd drawn the koloss away—she'd figured\nsomething out, something that he couldn't even guess at.\nShe always complains that she's not a scholar, he thought, smiling to himself. But that's just\nbecause she lacks education. She's twice as quick-witted as half the \"geniuses\" I knew during my\ndays at court.\nHe couldn't leave her alone. He needed to find her. Then . . . well, he didn't know what they'd do next.\nFind Sazed, perhaps? Either way, Elend could do no more in Fadrex. He moved to walk down the\nsteps, intending to find Ham and Cett. However, Yomen caught his shoulder.\nElend turned.\n\"I was wrong about you, Venture,\" Yomen said. \"The things I said were undeserved.\"\n\"You let me into your city when my men were surrounded by their own koloss,\" Elend said. \"I don't\ncare what you said about me. You're a good man in my estimation.\"\n\"You're wrong about the Lord Ruler, though,\" Yomen said. \"He's guiding this all.\"\nElend just smiled.\n\"It doesn't bother me that you don't believe,\" Yomen said, reaching up to his forehead. \"I've learned\nsomething. The Lord Ruler uses unbelievers as well as believers. We're all part of his plan. Here.\"\nYomen pulled the bead of atium free from its place at his brow. \"My last bead. In case you need it.\"\nElend accepted the bit of metal, rolling it over in his fingers. He'd never burned atium. For years, his\nfamily had overseen its mining—but, by the time Elend himself had become Mistborn, he'd already either\nspent what he'd been able to obtain, or had given it to Vin to be burned."

He'd assumed that was impossible, but it was hard to rely on assumptions about\nanything anymore. \"The Lord Ruler knew about your power?\"\nYomen smiled. \"Some secrets, he worked very hard to guard.\"\nAtium Mistings, Elend thought. That means there are others too . . . gold Mistings, electrum\nMistings . . . Though, as he thought about it, some—like aluminum Mistings or duralumin\nMistings—would be impossible to find because they couldn't use their metals without being able to burn\nother metals.\n\"Atium was too valuable to use in testing people for Allomantic powers anyway,\" Yomen said, turning\naway. \"I never really found the power all that useful. How often does one have both atium and the desire\nto use it up in a few heartbeats?

A few minutes later, he was streaking across the landscape, doing his best to fly with the\nhorseshoes as Vin had taught him.\nEach Hemalurgic spike driven through a person's body gave Ruin some small ability to influence\nthem. This was mitigated, however, by the mental fortitude of the one being controlled.\nIn most cases—depending on the size of the spike and the length of time it had been worn—a\nsingle spike gave Ruin only minimal powers over a person. He could appear to them, and could\nwarp their thoughts slightly, making them overlook certain oddities—for instance, their\ncompulsion for keeping and wearing a simple earring.\n75\nSAZED GATHERED HIS NOTES, carefully stacking the thin sheets of metal. Though the metal\nserved an important function in keeping Ruin from modifying—or perhaps even reading—their contents,\nSazed found them a bit frustrating. The plates were easily scratched, and they couldn't be folded or\nbound.\nThe kandra elders had given him a place to stay, and it was surprisingly lush for a cave. Kandra\napparently enjoyed human comforts—blankets, cushions, mattresses. Some even preferred to wear\nclothing, though those who didn't declined to create genitals for their True Bodies. That left him\nwondering about scholarly sorts of questions. They reproduced by transforming mistwraiths into kandra,\nso genitals would be redundant. Yet, the kandra identified themselves by gender—each was definitely a\n\"he\" or a \"she.\" So, how did they know? Did they choose arbitrarily, or did they actually know what they\nwould have been, had they been born human rather than as a mistwraith?\nHe wished he had more time to study their society.

He'd made a sheet of notes\nabout what he'd discovered, and it sat at the top of his metallic stack. It looked surprisingly, even\ndepressingly, similar to any number of sheets in his portfolio.\nThe Terris religion, as one might have expected, focused heavily on knowledge and scholarship. The\nWorldbringers—their word for Keepers—were holy men and women who imparted knowledge, but\nalso wrote of their god, Terr. It was the ancient Terris word for \"to preserve.\" A central focus of the\nreligion had been the histories of how Preservation—or Terr—and Ruin had interacted, and these\nincluded various prophecies about the Hero of Ages, who was seen as a successor to Preservation.\nAside from the prophecies, however, the Worldbringers had taught temperance, faith, and\nunderstanding to their people. They had taught that it was better to build than to destroy, a principle at\nthe core of their teachings. Of course there had been rituals, rites, initiations, and traditions. There were\nalso lesser religious leaders, required offerings, and codes of conduct. It all seemed good, but hardly\noriginal. Even the focus on scholarship was something shared by several dozen other religions Sazed had\nstudied.\nThat, for some reason, depressed him. It was just another religion.\nWhat had he expected? Some astounding doctrine that would prove to him once and for all that there\nwas a god? He felt like a fool. Yet, he also felt betrayed. This was what he'd ridden across the empire,\nfeeling elated and anticipatory, to discover? This was what he'd expected to save them? These were just\nmore words. Pleasant ones, like most in his portfolio, but hardly compelling. Was he supposed to believe\njust because it was the religion his people had followed?\nThere were no promises here that Tindwyl still lived. Why was it that people had followed this, or any,\nof the religions? Frustrated, Sazed dipped into his metalminds, dumping a group of accounts into his\nmind. Writings the Keepers had discovered—journals, letters, other sources from which scholars had\npieced together what had once been believed. He looked through them, thought of them, read them.\nWhat had made these people so willing to accept their religions? Were they simply products of their\nsociety, believing because it was tradition? He read of their lives, and tried to persuade himself that the\npeople were simpletons, that they hadn't ever truly questioned their beliefs. Surely they would have seen\nthe flaws and inconsistencies if they'd just taken the time to be rational and discerning.\nSazed sat with closed eyes, a wealth of information from journals and letters in his mind, searching for\nwhat he expected to find. However, as the time passed, he did not discover what he sought. The people\ndid not seem like fools to him. As he sat, something began to occur to him. Something about the words,\nthe feelings, of the people who had believed.\nBefore, Sazed had looked at the doctrines themselves.

As he read their words over again in his mind, he began\nto see something. The faiths he had looked at, they couldn't be divorced from the people who had\nadhered to them. In the abstract, those religions were stale. However, as he read the words of the\npeople—really read them—he began to see patterns.\nWhy did they believe? Because they saw miracles. Things one man took as chance, a man of faith\ntook as a sign. A loved one recovering from disease, a fortunate business deal, a chance meeting with a\nlong lost friend. It wasn't the grand doctrines or the sweeping ideals that seemed to make believers out of\nmen. It was the simple magic in the world around them.\nWhat was it Spook said? Sazed thought, sitting in the shadowy kandra cavern. That faith was about\ntrust. Trusting that somebody was watching. That somebody would make it all right in the end,\neven though things looked terrible at the moment.\nTo believe, it seemed, one had to want to believe. It was a conundrum, one Sazed had wrestled with.\nHe wanted someone, something, to force him to have faith. He wanted to have to believe because of the\nproof shown to him.\nYet, the believers whose words now filled his mind would have said he already had proof. Had he not,\nin his moment of despair, received an answer? As he had been about to give up, TenSoon had spoken.\nSazed had begged for a sign, and received it.\nWas it chance? Was it providence?\nIn the end, apparently, it was up to him to decide. He slowly returned the letters and journals to his\nmetalminds, leaving his specific memory of them empty—yet retaining the feelings they had prompted in\nhim. Which would he be? Believer or skeptic? At that moment, neither seemed a patently foolish path.\nI do want to believe, he thought. That's why I've spent so much time searching. I can't have it\nboth ways. I simply have to decide.\nWhich would it be? He sat for a few moments, thinking, feeling, and—most important—remembering.\nI sought help, Sazed thought. And something answered.\nSazed smiled, and everything seemed a little bit brighter. Breeze was right, he thought, standing and\norganizing his things as he prepared to go. I was not meant to be an atheist.\nThe thought seemed a little too flippant for what had just happened to him. As he picked up his metal\nsheets and prepared to go meet with the First Generation, he realized that kandra passed outside his\nhumble little cavern, completely oblivious to the important decision he'd just made.\nBut, that was how things often went, it seemed. Some important decisions were made on a battlefield\nor in a conference room. But others happened quietly, unseen by others. That didn't make the decision\nany less important to Sazed. He would believe. Not because something had been proven to him beyond\nhis ability to deny. But because he chose to.\nAs, he realized, Vin had once chosen to believe and trust in the crew.

Now that he had covered most of their religion, he\nplanned to find out more about the First Contract.\nAs far as he knew, he was the only human other than the Lord Ruler to have ever read its words. The\nmembers of the First Generation treated the metal bearing the contract with noticeably less reverence\nthan the other kandra. That had surprised him.\nOf course, Sazed thought, turning a corner, it does make some kind of sense. To the members of\nthe First Generation, the Lord Ruler was a friend. They remember climbing that mountain with\nhim—their leader, yes, but not a god. Kind of like the members of the crew, who had trouble\nseeing Kelsier in a religious light.\nStill lost in thought, Sazed wandered into the Trustwarren, whose broad metallic doors were open. He\npaused, however, just inside. The First Generation waited in their alcoves, as was common. They didn't\ncome down until Sazed closed the doors. Oddly, however, the members of the Second Generation stood\nat their lecterns, addressing the crowds of kandra—who, despite being far more reserved than a similar\ngroup of humans would have been, still displayed an air of anxiety.\n\". . . does it mean, KanPaar?\" one lesser kandra was asking. \"Please, we are confused. Ask the First\nGeneration.\"\n\"We have spoken of this thing already,\" said KanPaar, leader of the Seconds. \"There is no need for\nalarm. Look at you, crowding together, murmuring and rumormongering as if you were humans!\"\nSazed moved up to one of the younger kandra, who stood gathered outside the doorway to the\nTrustwarren. \"Please,\" he whispered. \"What is the source of this concern?\"\n\"The mists, Holy Worldbringer,\" the kandra—a female, he thought—whispered back.\n\"What of them?\" Sazed asked. \"The fact that they are staying later and later in the day?\"\n\"No,\" the kandra girl replied. \"The fact that they're gone.\"\nSazed started. \"What?\"\nThe kandra nodded. \"Nobody noticed it until early this morning. It was still dark out, and a guard\nwalked by to check one of the exits. He says there was no mist at all outside, despite it being night!\nOthers went out too. They all agree.\"\n\"This is a simple matter,\" KanPaar said to the chamber. \"We know that it was raining last night, and\nsometimes rain disperses the mists for a short time. They will return tomorrow.\"\n\"But, it's not raining now,\" one of the kandra said. \"And, it wasn't raining when TarKavv went out on\npatrol. There have been mists in the morning for months now. Where are they?\"\n\"Bah,\" KanPaar said, waving his hand. \"You worried when the mists started staying in the mornings,\nnow you complain that they are gone? We are kandra.

We are eternal—we outwait everything and\nanything. We don't gather in rowdy mobs. Go back to what you were doing. This means nothing.\"\n\"No,\" a voice whispered into the cavern. Heads turned up, and the entire group hushed.\n\"No,\" Haddek—leader of the First Generation—whispered from his hidden alcove. \"This is important.\nWe have been wrong, KanPaar. Very . . . very wrong. Clear the Trustwarren. Leave only the Keeper\nbehind. And spread the word. The day of the Resolution may have come.\"\nThis comment only served to agitate the kandra further. Sazed stood frozen with wonder; he had never\nseen such a reaction in the normally calm creatures. They did as they were told—kandra appeared to be\nvery good at that—and left the room, but there were whispers and debates. The Seconds slunk out last,\nlooking humiliated. Sazed watched them go, thinking about KanPaar's words.\nWe are eternal—we outwait everything and anything. Suddenly, the kandra began to make more\nsense to Sazed. How easy it would be to ignore the outside world if one were immortal. They had\noutlasted so many problems and predicaments, upheavals and riots, that anything occurring on the\noutside must have seemed trivial.\nSo trivial, in fact, that it was even possible to ignore the prophecies of one's own religion as they\nstarted to come true. Eventually, the room was empty, and a pair of beefy members of the Fifth\nGeneration pushed the doors closed from outside, leaving Sazed alone on the floor of the room. He\nwaited patiently, arranging his notes on his desk as the members of the First Generation hobbled out of\ntheir hidden stairwells and joined him on the floor of the Trustwarren.\n\"Tell me, Keeper,\" Haddek said as his brothers seated themselves, \"what do you make of this event?\"\n\"The departure of the mists?\" Sazed asked. \"It does seem portentous—though, admittedly, I cannot\ngive a specific reason why.\"\n\"That is because there are things we have not yet explained to you,\" Haddek said, looking toward the\nothers. They seemed very troubled. \"Things relating to the First Contract, and the promises of the\nkandra.\"\nSazed readied a sheet of metal paper. \"Please, continue.\"\n\"I must ask that you not record these words,\" Haddek said.\nSazed paused, then set down his pen. \"Very well—though I warn you. The memory of a Keeper, even\nwithout his metalminds, is very long.\"\n\"That cannot be helped,\" said one of the others. \"We need your counsel, Keeper. As an outsider.\"\n\"As a son,\" another whispered.\n\"When the Father made us,\" Haddek said. \"He . . . gave us a charge. Something different from the\nFirst Contract.\"\n\"To him, it was almost an afterthought,\" one of the others added. \"Though once he mentioned it, he\nimplied it was very important.\"\n\"He made us promise,\" Haddek said. \"Each of us. He told us that someday, we might be required to\nremove our Blessings.\"\n\"Pull them from our bodies,\" one of the others added."

He said that\nwe would have to make certain the other kandra knew of this charge.\"\n\"We call it the Resolution,\" Haddek said. \"Each kandra is told of it when he or she is first birthed. They\nare given the charge—sworn and ingrained—to pull their Blessing free, should the First Generation\ncommand it. We have never invoked this charge.\"\n\"But you're considering it now?\" Sazed asked, frowning. \"I do not understand. Simply because of the\nway that the mists are acting?\"\n\"The mists are the body of Preservation, Keeper,\" Haddek said. \"This is a very portentous event.\"\n\"We have been listening to our children discuss it all morning,\" another said. \"And it troubles us. They\ndo not know all the mists represent, but they are aware of their importance.\"\n\"Rashek said that we'd know,\" another said. \"He told us. 'The day will come when you have to\nremove your Blessings. You'll know when it arrives.' \"\nHaddek nodded. \"He said that we'd know. And . . . we are very worried.\"\n\"How can we order the deaths of all of our people?\" another asked. \"The Resolution has always\nbothered me.\"\n\"Rashek saw the future,\" Haddek said, turning. \"He held the power of Preservation and wielded it. He\nis the only man ever to have done so! Even this girl of whom the Keeper speaks did not use the power.\nOnly Rashek! The Father.\"\n\"Where, then, are the mists?\" another asked.\nThe room fell silent again. Sazed sat, pen held in his hand, yet not writing anything. He leaned forward.\n\"The mists are the body of Preservation?\"\nThe others nodded.\n\"And . . . it has disappeared?\"\nAgain, a nod.\n\"Does this not mean, then, that Preservation has returned?\"\n\"That is impossible,\" Haddek said. \"Preservation's power remains, for power cannot be destroyed. His\nmind, however, was all but destroyed—for this was the sacrifice he made to imprison Ruin.\"\n\"The sliver remains,\" another reminded. \"The shadow of self.\"\n\"Yes,\" Haddek said. \"But that is not Preservation, just an image—a remnant. Now that Ruin has\nescaped, I think we can assume that even it has been destroyed.\"\n\"I think it is more,\" another began. \"We could—\"\nSazed held up his hands, getting their attention. \"If Preservation has not returned, then has, perhaps,\nsomeone else taken up his power to use in this fight? Is that not what your teachings say will happen?\nThat which has been sundered must again begin to find its whole.\"\nSilence.\n\"Perhaps,\" Haddek said."

At that moment, however,\nthe doors to the Trustwarren burst open.\nSazed paused, turning with a frown. A group of rock-boned Fifth Generationers clomped into the\nroom, followed by the willowy members of the Second Generation. Outside, the cavern hallway was\nempty of its earlier crowd.\n\"Take them,\" KanPaar said furtively, pointing.\n\"What is this!\" Haddek exclaimed.\nSazed sat where he was, pen held in his fingers. He recognized the urgent, tense posture in the figures\nof the Second Generationers. Some looked frightened, others determined. The Fifth Generationers\nmoved forward quickly, their movements enhanced by the Blessing of Potency.\n\"KanPaar!\" Haddek said. \"What is this?\"\nSazed slowly stood up. Four Fifth Generationers came over to surround him, bearing hammers as\nweapons.\n\"It's a coup,\" Sazed said.\n\"You can no longer lead,\" KanPaar said to the First Generation. \"You would destroy what we have\nhere, polluting our land with outsiders, letting the talk of revolutionaries cloud kandra wisdom.\"\n\"This is not the time, KanPaar,\" Haddek said, the members of the First Generation crying out as they\nwere prodded and grappled.\n\"Not the time?\" KanPaar asked angrily. \"You spoke of the Resolution! Have you no idea the panic this\nhas caused? You would destroy everything we have.\"\nSazed turned calmly, looking at KanPaar. Despite his angry tone, the kandra was smiling slightly\nthrough translucent lips.\nHe had to strike now, Sazed thought, before the First Generation said more to the common\npeople—making the Seconds redundant. KanPaar can stuff them all away somewhere, and then\nprop up dummies in the alcoves.\nSazed reached for his pewtermind. One of the Fifths snapped it away with a too-quick grab of the\nhand, and two others took Sazed by the arms. He struggled, but his kandra captors were inhumanly\nstrong.\n\"KanPaar!\" Haddek yelled. The First's voice was surprisingly strong. \"You are of the Second\nGeneration—you owe obedience to me. We created you!\"\nKanPaar ignored him, directing his kandra to bind the members of the First Generation. The other\nSeconds stood in a cluster behind him, looking increasingly apprehensive and shocked at what they were\ndoing.\n\"The time for the Resolution may indeed be here!\" Haddek said. \"We must—\" He cut off as one of the\nFifths gagged him.\n\"That is exactly why I must take leadership,\" KanPaar said, shaking his head. \"You are too unstable,\nold one. I will not trust the future of our people to a creature who could, at a whim, order them to kill\nthemselves.\"\n\"You fear change,\" Sazed said, meeting the kandra's eyes.\n\"I fear instability,\" KanPaar said. \"I will make certain the kandra people have a firm and immutable\nleadership.\""

When one\nburned tin, he or she could see farther at night, looking through the mists. To the layman, this\nmight seem like a logical connection—tin, after all, enhances the senses.\nThe logical mind, however, may find a puzzle in this ability. How, exactly, would tin let one see\nthrough the mists? As an obstruction, they are unconnected with the quality of one's eyesight.\nBoth the nearsighted scholar and the long-sighted scout would have the same trouble seeing into\nthe distance if there were a wall in the way.\nThis, then, should have been our first clue. Allomancers could see through the mists because the\nmists were, indeed, composed of the very same power as Allomancy. Once attuned by burning tin,\nthe Allomancer was almost part of the mists. And therefore, they became more translucent to him.\n76\nVIN . . . FLOATED. She wasn't asleep, but she didn't quite feel awake either. She was disoriented,\nuncertain.

Was she in Clubs's shop, worried and confused by the kindness of this strange new crew?\nWas she huddled in an alleyway, crying, back hurting from another of Reen's beatings?\nShe felt about her, trying to make sense of her surroundings. Her arms and legs didn't seem to work.\nIn fact, she couldn't even really focus on them. The longer she floated, however, the clearer her vision\nbecame. She was . . . in Luthadel. After killing the Inquisitors.\nWhy couldn't she feel anything? She tried to reach down, to push herself to her knees, but the ground\nseemed strangely far away. And, she saw no arms in front of her. She just continued to float.\nI'm dead, she thought.\nEven as that occurred to her, she woke up a bit more. She could see, though it was as if she looked\nthrough a very blurry, distorting pane of glass. She felt . . . a power buzzing within her.

And, halfway through her turn, she came\nface-to-face with something dark.\nShe couldn't tell how far away it was. It seemed close and distant at the same time. She could view it\nwith detail—far more detail than she could see in the actual world—but she couldn't touch it. She knew,\ninstinctively, what it was.\nRuin no longer looked like Reen. Instead, he manifested as a large patch of shifting black smoke. A\nthing without a body, but with a consciousness greater than that of a simple human.\nThat . . . is what I've become, Vin realized, thoughts becoming clearer.\nVin, Ruin spoke. His voice was not that of Reen, but instead something more . . . guttural. It was a\nvibration that washed across her, like an Allomantic pulse.\nWelcome, Ruin said, to godhood.\nVin remained silent, though she quested out with her power, trying to get a sense of what she could\ndo. Understanding seemed to open to her. It was like before, when she'd taken the power at the Well of\nAscension. She immediately knew things. Only this time, the power was so vast—the understanding so\ngreat—that it seemed to have shocked her mind. Fortunately, that mind was expanding, and she was\ngrowing.\nAwakening.\nShe rose above the city, knowing that the power spinning through her—the core of her\nexistence—was simply a hub. A focus for power that stretched across the entire world. She could be\nanywhere she wished. Indeed, a part of her was in all places at once. She could see the world as a\nwhole.\nAnd it was dying. She felt its tremors, saw its life ebbing. Already, most of the plant life on the planet\nwas dead. Animals would go quickly—the ones who survived were those who could find a way to chew\non dead foliage now covered by ash. Humans would not be far behind, though Vin found it interesting to\nnote that a surprising percentage of them had found their way down into one or another of the storage\ncaverns.\nNot storage caverns . . . Vin thought, finally understanding the Lord Ruler's purpose. Shelters.\nThat's why they're so vast. They're like fortresses for people to hide in. To wait, to survive a little\nlonger.\nWell, she would fix that. She felt electrified with power. She reached out and plugged the ashmounts.\nShe soothed them, deadened them, smothered their ability to spray ash and lava. Then, she reached into\nthe sky and wiped the smoke and darkness from the atmosphere—like a maid wiping soot from a dirty\nwindow. She did all of this in a matter of instants; not more than five minutes would have passed on the\nworld below.\nImmediately, the land began to burn.\nThe sun was amazingly powerful—she hadn't realized how much the ash and smoke had done to\nshield the land. She cried out, spinning the world quickly so that the sun moved to its other side.\nDarkness fell. And, as soon as she did that, tempests began to swoop across the landscape. Weather\npatterns were disrupted by the motion, and in the sea a sudden wave appeared, enormously large. It\nrolled toward the coast, threatening to wipe away several cities."

When he first took the\npower, he tried to solve everything. All of man's ills.\nShe saw it. She wasn't omniscient—she couldn't see the entirety of the past. However, she could see\nthe history of the power she held. She could see when Rashek had taken it, and she could see him,\nfrustrated, trying to pull the planet into a proper orbit. Yet, he pulled it too far, leaving the world cold and\nfreezing. He pushed it back again, but his power was too vast—too terrible—for him to control properly\nat that time. So, he again left the world too hot. All life would have perished.\nHe opened the ashmounts, clogging the atmosphere, turning the sun red. And, in doing so, he saved\nthe planet—but doomed it as well.\nYou are so impetuous, Ruin thought. I have held this power for a period of time longer than you\ncan imagine. It takes care and precision to use it correctly.\nUnless, of course, you just want to destroy.\nHe reached out with a power Vin could feel. Immediately, without knowing how or why, she blocked\nhim. She threw her power up against his, and he halted, unable to act.\nBelow, the tsunami crashed into the coast. There were still people down there. People who had\nhidden from the koloss, who had survived on fish from the sea when their crops failed. Vin felt their pain,\ntheir terror, and she cried out as she reached to protect them.\nAnd, again, was stopped.\nNow you know the frustration, Ruin said as the tsunami destroyed villages. What was it your Elend\nsaid? For every Push, there is a Pull. Throw something up, and it will come back down.\nOpposition.\nFor Ruin, there is Preservation. Time immemorial! Eternity! And each time I push, YOU push\nback. Even when dead, you stopped me, for we are forces. I can do nothing! And you can do\nnothing! Balance! The curse of our existence.\nVin suffered as the people below were crushed, washed away, and drowned. Please, she said.\nPlease just let me save them.\nWhy? Ruin asked. What is it I told you before? Everything you do serves me. It is out of\nkindness that I stop you. For, even if you were to reach your hand out for them, you would\ndestroy more than you preserve.\nThat is always the way it is.\nVin hung, listening to the screams. And yet, a part of her mind—now so vast, now capable of many\nthoughts at once—dissected Ruin's words.\nThey were untrue. He said that all things destroyed, yet he complained about balance. He warned that\nshe would only destroy more, but she could not believe that he would stop her out of kindness. He\nwanted her to destroy."

She could have saved those people, if he\nhadn't stopped her. True, she probably didn't have the accuracy to do it yet. That wasn't the power's\nfault, however, but hers. He had to stop her so that she wouldn't learn, as the Lord Ruler had, and\nbecome more capable with the power.\nShe spun away from him, moving back toward Luthadel. Her awareness was still expanding, but she\nwas confused by something she saw. Bright points of light, dotting the landscape, shining like flares. She\ndrew closer, trying to figure out what they were. Yet, just as it was difficult to look directly at a bright\nlantern and see what was emitting the light, it was difficult to discern the source of this power.\nShe figured it out as she reached Luthadel. A large glow was coming from the broken palace. Most of\nthe light was shaped vaguely like . . .\nSpires. Metal. That's what caused the glowing power. I was right. Metal is power, and it's why\nRuin couldn't read things written in steel. Vin turned away from a brightly shining spire. Ruin was\nthere, as always, watching her.\nI was surprised when Preservation said he wanted to create you, Ruin said, a bit of curiosity in his\nvoice. Other life is ordered by way of nature. Balanced. But Preservation . . . he wanted to create\nsomething intentionally unbalanced. Something that could choose to preserve at times, but to ruin\nat others. Something in the form of that which we'd seen before. It was intriguing.\nI find it odd that he expended so much of himself to create you. Why would he weaken himself,\neventually giving me the strength to destroy the world, simply to place human beings on his\nworld? I know that others call his death to imprison me a sacrifice, but that wasn't the sacrifice.\nHis sacrifice came much earlier.\nYes, he still tried to betray me—to imprison me. But, he could not stop me. He could only slow\nme. Forestall. Delay. Since the day we created you, there has been an imbalance. I was stronger.\nAnd he knew it.\nVin frowned—or, at least, she felt as if she were frowning, though she no longer had a body. His\nwords . . .\nHe says he's stronger, Vin thought. Yet, we are equally matched. Is he lying again?\nNo . . . he didn't lie. Looking back with her ever-expanding mind, she saw that everything Ruin said,\nhe believed. He truly thought that whatever she did helped him. He saw the world through the lenses of\ndestruction.\nHe wasn't lying about being more powerful than she. Yet, they were obviously matched at the\nmoment. Which meant . . .\nThere's another piece of Ruin out there, Vin thought. Preservation is weaker because he gave up\na piece of himself to create mankind.

Then, he would be able to destroy completely—they would no longer be balanced.\nShe swung about in frustration, a glowing white aura of mist with wispy tendrils expanding across the\nentire world. There's so much I still don't know, Vin thought.\nIt was an odd thing to acknowledge, with her mind broadening to include so much. Yet, her ignorance\nwas no longer that of a person. Her ignorance was related to experience. Ruin had such a huge head start\non her. He had created for himself servants who could act without his direction, and so she could not\nblock them.\nShe saw his planning manifest in the world. She saw him subtly influencing the Lord Ruler a thousand\nyears ago. Even while Rashek held the power of Preservation, Ruin had whispered in his ear, directing\nhim toward an understanding of Hemalurgy. And, Rashek had obeyed without realizing it, creating\nminions—armies—for Ruin to take when the time was right.\nVin could see them—the koloss—converging toward Luthadel.\nI will give you credit, Vin, Ruin said, hovering nearby.

Not only could Allomancers' vision pierce the mists, but there\nwas the fact that the mists swirled slightly around the body of a person using any kind of\nAllomancy.\nMore telling, perhaps, was the fact that when a Hemalurgist used his abilities, it drove the mists\naway. The closer one came to Ruin, the more under his influence, and the longer one bore his\nspikes, the more the mists were repelled.\n77\nELEND STOOD IN THE RUBBLE of Kredik Shaw, mind numb as he contemplated the destruction.\nIt seemed . . . impossible. What force could have leveled such an enormous, majestic building? What\ncould have caused such destruction, breaking apart buildings and flinging rubble several streets away?\nAnd, all of the destruction was focused here, at what had once been the center of the Lord Ruler's\npower.\nElend skidded down some rubble, approaching the center of what looked like an impact crater. He\nturned around in the dark night, looking at the fallen blocks and spires.\n\"Lord Ruler . . .\" he swore quietly, unable to help himself. Had something happened at the Well of\nAscension? Had it exploded?\nElend turned, looking across his city. It appeared to be empty. Luthadel, largest metropolis in the Final\nEmpire, seat of his government. Empty. Much of it in ruins, a good third of it burned, and Kredik Shaw\nitself flattened as if it had been pounded by the fist of a god."

He'd come to Luthadel hoping to find Vin, but had been forced to take a slight detour to the\nsouth in order to get around a particularly large swath of lava burning the plains around Mount Tyrian.\nThat sight, along with the sight of Luthadel in ruin, left him very disturbed.\nWhere was Vin?\nHe jumped from building to building. He kicked up ash with each leap. Things were happening. The\nash was slowly trickling away—in fact, it had mostly stopped falling. That was good, but he remembered\nwell a short time ago when the sun had suddenly blazed with an amazing intensity. Those few moments\nhad burned him so that his face still hurt.\nThen, the sun had . . . dropped. It had fallen below the horizon in less than a second, the ground\nlurching beneath Elend's feet. Part of him assumed that he was going mad. Yet, he could not deny that it\nwas now nighttime, even if his body—and one of the city clocks he had visited—indicated that it should\nhave been afternoon.\nHe landed on a building, then jumped off, Pushing against a broken door handle. He shivered as he\nmoved in the open air of darkness. It was night—the stars blazing uncomfortably above—and there was\nno mist. Vin had told him that the mists would protect him. What would protect him now that they were\ngone?\nHe made his way to Keep Venture, his palace. He found the building to be a burned-out husk. He\nlanded in the courtyard, staring up at his home—the place he had been raised—trying to make sense of\nthe destruction. Several guards in the brown colors of his livery lay decomposing on the cobblestones. All\nwas still.\nWhat in the hell happened here? he thought with frustration. He poked through the building, but\nfound no clues. All had been burned. He left via a broken window on the top floor, then paused at\nsomething he saw in the rear courtyard.\nHe dropped to the ground. And there, beneath a patio canopy that had kept off much of the ash, he\nfound a corpse in a fine gentlemen's suit lying on the cobbles. Elend rolled it over, noting the sword thrust\nthrough its stomach and the posture of a suicide. The corpse's fingers still held the weapon. Penrod, he\nthought, recognizing the face. Dead, presumably, by his own hand.\nSomething lay scrawled in charcoal on the patio floor. Elend wiped away the drifted ash, smudging the\nletters in the process. Fortunately, he could still read them. I'm sorry, it read. Something has taken\ncontrol of me . . . of this city. I am lucid only part of the time. Better to kill myself than to cause\nmore destruction. Look toward the Terris Dominance for your people.\nElend turned toward the north. Terris? That seemed like a very odd place in which to seek refuge. If\nthe people of the city had fled, then why would they have left the Central Dominance, the place where the\nmists were the weakest?\nHe eyed the scribbles."

Lies . . .\nRuin could change text. Words like Penrod's couldn't be trusted. Elend bid a silent farewell to the\ncorpse, wishing he had the time to bury the old statesman, then dropped a coin to Push himself into the\nair.\nThe people of Luthadel had gone somewhere. If Ruin had found a way to kill them, then Elend would\nhave found more corpses. He suspected that if he took the time to search, he could probably find people\nstill hiding in the city. Likely, the disappearance of the mists—then the sudden change from day to\nnight—had driven them into hiding. Perhaps they had made it to the storage cavern beneath Kredik\nShaw. Elend hoped that not many had gone there, considering the damage that had been done to the\npalace. If there were people there, they would be sealed in.\nWest . . . the wind seemed to whisper. Pits . . .\nRuin usually changes text so that it's very similar to what it said before, Elend thought. So . . .\nPenrod probably did write most of those words, trying to tell me where to go to find my people.\nRuin made it sound like they went to the Terris Dominance, but what if Penrod originally wrote\nthat they went to the Terris people?\nIt made good sense. If he'd fled Luthadel, he would have gone there—it was a place where there was\nalready an established group of refugees, a group with herds, crops, and food.\nElend turned west, leaving the city, cloak flapping with each Allomantic bound.\nSuddenly, Ruin's frustration made even more sense to Vin. She felt she held the power of all creation.\nYet, it took everything she had to get even a few words to Elend.\nShe wasn't even certain if he'd heard her or not. She knew him so well, however, that she felt a . . .\nconnection. Despite Ruin's efforts to block her, she felt as if some part of her had been able to get\nthrough to some part of Elend. Perhaps in the same way Ruin was able to communicate with his\nInquisitors and followers?\nStill, her near-impotence was infuriating.\nBalance, Ruin spat. Balance imprisoned me. Preservation's sacrifice—that was to siphon off the\npart of me that was stronger, to lock it away, to leave me equal with him again. For a time.\nOnly for a time. And what is time to us, Vin?\nNothing.\nIt may seem odd to those reading this that atium was part of the body of a god. However, it is\nnecessary to understand that when we said \"body\" we generally meant \"power.\" As my mind has\nexpanded, I've come to realize that objects and energy are actually composed of the very same\nthings, and can change state from one to another. It makes perfect sense to me that the power of\ngodhood would be manifest within the world in physical form. Ruin and Preservation were not\nnebulous abstractions. They were integral parts of existence. In a way, every object that existed in\nthe world was composed of their power."

In a way, every object that existed in\nthe world was composed of their power.\nAtium, then, was an object that was one-sided. Instead of being composed of half Ruin and half\nPreservation—as, say, a rock would be—atium was completely of Ruin. The Pits of Hathsin were\ncrafted by Preservation as a place to hide the chunk of Ruin's body that he had stolen away\nduring the betrayal and imprisonment. Kelsier didn't truly destroy this place by shattering those\ncrystals, for they would have regrown eventually—in a few hundred years—and continued to\ndeposit atium, as the place was a natural outlet for Ruin's trapped power.\nWhen people burned atium, then, they were drawing upon the power of Ruin—which is,\nperhaps, why atium turned people into such efficient killing machines. They didn't use up this\npower, however, but simply made use of it. Once a nugget of atium was expended, the power\nwould return to the Pits and begin to coalesce again—just as the power at the Well of Ascension\nwould return there again after it had been used.\n78\nTHIS IS, SAZED THOUGHT, without a doubt, the oddest dungeon I have ever been in.\nGranted, it was only the second time he had been imprisoned. Still, he had observed several prisons in\nhis lifetime, and had read of others. Most were like cages. This one, however, consisted only of a hole in\nthe ground with an iron grate covering the top. Sazed scrunched down inside of it, stripped of his\nmetalminds, his legs cramped.\nIt was probably built for a kandra, he thought. One without bones, perhaps? What would a\nkandra without bones be like? A pile of goo? Or, perhaps, a pile of muscles?\nEither way, this prison had not been meant to hold a man—particularly not one as tall as Sazed. He\ncould barely move. He reached up, pushing against the grate, but it was secure. A large lock held it in\nplace.\nHe wasn't certain how long he had been in the pit. Hours? Perhaps even days. They still hadn't given\nhim anything to eat, though a member of the Third Generation had poured some water on him. Sazed\nwas still wet with it, and he had taken to sucking on the cloth of his robes to assuage his thirst.\nThis is silly, he thought, not for the first time. The world is ending, and I'm in prison? He was the\nfinal Keeper, the Announcer. He should be up above, recording events.\nBecause, truth be told, he was beginning to believe that the world would not end. He had accepted\nthat something, perhaps Preservation itself, was watching over and protecting mankind. He was more\nand more determined to follow the Terris religion—not because it was perfect, but because he would\nrather believe and have hope.\nThe Hero was real. Sazed believed that. And he had faith in her.\nHe had lived with Kelsier and had helped the man. He had chronicled the rise of the Church of the\nSurvivor during the first years of its development.

He had even researched the Hero of Ages with\nTindwyl and taken it upon himself to announce Vin as the one who fulfilled the prophecies. But it was\nonly recently that he'd started to have faith in her. Perhaps it was his decision to be someone who saw\nmiracles. Perhaps it was the daunting fear of the ending that seemed to loom just ahead. Perhaps it was\nthe tension and anxiety. Regardless, somehow, from the chaos, he drew peace.\nShe would come. She would preserve the world. However, Sazed needed to be ready to help. And\nthat meant escaping.\nHe eyed the metal grate. The lock was of fine steel, the grate itself of iron. He reached up tentatively,\ntouching the bars, draining a bit of his weight and putting it into the iron. Immediately, his body grew\nlighter. In Feruchemy, iron stored physical weight, and the grate was pure enough to hold a Feruchemical\ncharge. It went against his instincts to use the grate as a metalmind—it wasn't portable, and if he had to\nflee, he'd leave behind all of the power he'd saved. Yet, what good would it be to simply sit in the pit and\nwait?\nHe reached up with the other hand, touching the steel lock with one finger. Then, he began to fill it as\nwell, draining his body of speed. He instantly began to feel lethargic, as if his every motion—even his\nbreathing—was more difficult. It was like he had to push through some thick substance each time he\nmoved.\nHe stayed that way. He had learned to enter a kind of meditative trance when he filled metalminds.\nOften, he would fill many at once, leaving himself sickly, weak, slow, and dull-minded. When he could, it\nwas better to simply . . .\nDrift.\nHe wasn't certain how long the meditation lasted. Occasionally, the guard came to pour water on him.\nWhen the sounds came, Sazed would let go and huddle down, pretending to sleep. But, as soon as the\nguard withdrew, he would reach back up and continue to fill the metalminds.\nMore time passed. Then, he heard sounds. Sazed huddled down again, then waited expectantly for the\nshower of water.\n\"When I sent you back to save my people,\" a voice growled, \"this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.\"\nSazed popped his eyes open, glancing upward, and was surprised to see a canine face looking through\nthe grate. \"TenSoon?\" Sazed asked.\nThe kandra grunted and stepped back. Sazed perked up as another kandra appeared. She wore a\ndelicate True Body made of wood, willowy and almost inhuman. And, she held some keys.\n\"Quickly, MeLaan,\" TenSoon growled with his dog's voice. He had apparently switched back to the\nwolfhound, which made sense. Moving as a horse through the sometimes steep and narrow tunnels of the\nHomeland would have been difficult.\nThe female kandra unlocked the grate, then pulled it back. Sazed eagerly climbed free. In the room, he\nfound several other kandra wearing deviant True Bodies. In the corner, the prison guard lay bound and\ngagged.\n\"I was seen entering the Homeland, Terrisman,\" TenSoon said. \"So we have little time. What has"

MeLaan told me of your imprisonment—KanPaar announced that the First Generation\nhad ordered you taken. What did you do to antagonize them?\"\n\"Not them,\" Sazed said, stretching his cramped legs. \"It was the Second Generation. They have taken\nthe Firsts captive, and plan to rule in their stead.\"\nThe girl—MeLaan—gasped. \"They would never!\"\n\"They did,\" Sazed said, standing. \"I fear for the safety of the Firsts. KanPaar may have been afraid to\nkill me because I am human. However, the Firsts . . .\"\n\"But,\" MeLaan said, \"the Seconds are kandra. They wouldn't do something like that! We're not that\nkind of people.\"\nTenSoon and Sazed shared a look. All societies have people who break the rules, child, Sazed\nthought. Particularly when power is concerned.\n\"We have to find the Firsts,\" TenSoon said. \"And recover the Trustwarren.\"\n\"We will fight with you, TenSoon,\" one of the other kandra said.\n\"We're finally throwing them off!\" another said. \"The Seconds, and their insistence that we serve the\nhumans!\"\nSazed frowned at this. What did humans have to do with this conflict? Then, however, he noticed how\nthe others regarded TenSoon. The dog's body, he realized. To them, TenSoon is a revolutionary of\nthe highest order—all because of something Vin ordered him to do.\nTenSoon met Sazed eyes again, opening his mouth to speak. Then, however, he paused. \"They're\ncoming,\" he said with a curse, his dog's ears flattening.\nSazed spun with concern, noticing shadows on the rock wall of the corridor leading into the prison\nchamber. The chamber was small, with six or so pit cells in the floor. There were no other entrances.\nDespite their brave words, TenSoon's companions immediately shied back, huddling against the wall.\nThey were obviously not accustomed to conflict, particularly with their own kind. TenSoon shared none\nof their timidity. He charged forward as soon as the group of Fifths entered the room, ramming his\nshoulder into one's chest, howling and clawing at another.\nThere is a kandra who fits in with his people as poorly as I do with my own, Sazed thought,\nsmiling. He stepped backward, moving up onto the top of the prison grate, touching its metals with his\nbare feet.\nThe Fifths had trouble fighting TenSoon—he had trained with Vin, and was apparently quite confident\nin his dog's body. He kept moving, knocking them over. However, there were five of them, and only one\nTenSoon. He was forced to retreat.\nThe wounds in his body close as he orders them, Sazed noticed. That must be why the guards\nusually carry hammers.\nWhich made it fairly obvious how one had to fight kandra. TenSoon backed up beside Sazed. \"I\napologize,\" the dog growled. \"This isn't much of a rescue.\""

Immediately, his body\ngrew several times heavier than normal, and he grabbed a kandra guard by the arms.\nThen fell on him.\nSazed always said he wasn't a warrior. However, the number of times he'd said that, then been forced\nto fight anyway, made him think he was losing that excuse. The truth was, he'd been in far more battles\nover the last few years than he felt he had any right to have survived.\nEither way, he knew some rudimentary moves—and, with both Feruchemy and surprise to aid him,\nthat was about all he needed. Tapping weight increased the density of his body and of his bones, keeping\nhim from damaging himself as he collapsed on top of the soldier. Sazed felt a satisfying crack as they hit\nthe grate, Sazed's greatly increased weight crushing the kandra guard's bones. They used stone True\nBodies, but even that wasn't enough.\nSazed released the metalmind, then began to fill it instead, making his body incredibly light. He touched\nhis foot to the steel lock, and tapped speed. Suddenly, he was faster than any man had a right to be. He\nstood up even as the other four guards turned toward him in surprise.\nHe stopped filling his ironmind, regaining normal weight, then reached with a blurring speed to pick up\nthe hammer of the fallen soldier. He didn't have enhanced strength, but he had speed. He slammed the\nhammer down on a kandra shoulder, growing heavier to add to the momentum of his blow.\nThe kandra's bones shattered. Sazed snapped his foot on the lock and tapped all of the remaining\nspeed. He crouched, pivoting, and slammed his hammer into the knees of two kandra who were trying to\nattack him with their own hammers.\nThey cried out, falling, as Sazed's speed ran out.\nHe stood up straight. TenSoon was sitting atop the final guard, pinning him to the ground. \"I thought\nyou were a scholar,\" the dog noted, his captive squirming.\nSazed tossed aside the hammer. \"I am,\" he said. \"Vin would have fought her way free from this prison\ndays ago. Now, I believe we should deal with these . . .\" He waved toward the fallen Fifths, who seemed\nto have quite a bit of trouble moving with their bones broken.\nTenSoon nodded. He motioned for some of his friends to help him with the one he was sitting on.\nThey held the captive tentatively, but there were enough of them to keep the prisoner still.\n\"What have you done here, FhorKood?\" TenSoon demanded of the captive. Sazed kept an eye on\nthe other Fifths, and was forced to slam a mallet against one of them, breaking more bones as he tried to\nsneak away.\nFhorKood spat. \"Dirty Third,\" he muttered."

If the world weren't ending, I'd find that far more amusing.\nNow, speak!\"\nSazed paused as he noticed something. The other cells in the floor were occupied. He leaned down,\nrecognizing something about the muscles he saw inside. They were . . . discolored, and a bit deformed.\nLike . . . hanging moss.\n\"TenSoon!\" he said, looking up. \"Perhaps the First Generation is still alive. Come here.\"\nTenSoon moved over, then looked down at the pit, frowning with canine lips. \"MeLaan! The keys!\"\nShe rushed over, unlocking the grate. With some consternation, Sazed was able to determine that\nthere were multiple sets of squirming muscles in the pit, each of a slightly different color.\n\"We need bones,\" TenSoon said, standing.\nMeLaan nodded, rushing from the room. Sazed shared a look with TenSoon.\n\"They must have killed the other kandra in these cells,\" TenSoon said softly. \"Traitors to our kind,\nimprisoned endlessly. It was to have been my fate. Either way, it is clever—everyone thinks that these\ncells hold dire criminals. It wouldn't be odd for the Fifths to continue feeding them, and nobody would\nsuspect that the occupants had been replaced with the First Generation, assuming they didn't look too\nclosely at the color of the muscles.\"\n\"We need to keep moving,\" Sazed said. \"Get to KanPaar.\"\nTenSoon shook his head. \"We won't get far without the Firsts to tell our story, Terrisman. Go and\nstore more of your Feruchemy. We may need it.\"\nWith that, TenSoon moved over, crouching over to their captive. \"You have two options, FhorKood,\"\nhe said. \"Either relinquish those bones, or I'll digest your body and kill you, as I did OreSeur.\"\nSazed frowned, watching. The captured kandra seemed terrified of TenSoon. The Fifth's body\nliquefied, and he moved slug-like away from the granite bones. TenSoon smiled.\n\"What is that for?\" Sazed asked.\n\"Something Zane taught me,\" TenSoon said, his dog's body beginning to melt, the hair falling out.\n\"Nobody expects a kandra to be an impostor. In a few moments, FhorKood here will return to the\nSecond Generation and tell them that the traitor TenSoon has been captured. I should be able to stall\nlong enough for the Firsts to regenerate—they will take far longer than I do to make bodies.\"\nSazed nodded. MeLaan returned a short time later with a large sack full of bones, and\nTenSoon—having re-created FhorKood's body with incredible speed—moved out of the chamber on\nhis mission.\nThen, Sazed sat down, removing the lock and holding it to use as a metalmind, using an iron hammer in\nthe other hand to store weight.

Sazed thought. I have the First Generation here—they're the\nones I needed. I can continue to question them, learn what I want. TenSoon will have KanPaar\ndistracted. It doesn't matter that the Seconds will be in charge for a few more hours.\nWhat harm could they possibly do?\nI believe that the mists were searching for someone to become a new host for them. The power\nneeded a consciousness to direct it. In this matter, I am still rather confused. Why would power\nused to create and destroy need a mind to oversee it? And yet, it seems to have only a vague will\nof its own, tied in to the mandate of its abilities. Without a consciousness to direct it, nothing\ncould actually be created or destroyed. It's as if the power of Preservation understands that its\ntendency to reinforce stability is not enough. If nothing changed, nothing would ever come to exist\n.\nThat makes me wonder who or what the minds of Preservation and Ruin were.\nRegardless, the mists—the power of Preservation—chose someone to become their host long\nbefore all of this happened. That someone, however, was immediately seized by Ruin and used as\na pawn. He must have known that by giving her a disguised Hemalurgic spike, he would keep the\nmists from investing themselves in her as they wished.\nThe three times she drew upon their power, then, were the three times when her earring had\nbeen removed from her body. When she had fought the Lord Ruler, his Allomancy had ripped it\nfree. When fighting Marsh in Fadrex, she had used the earring as a weapon. And, at the end,\nMarsh ripped it out, freeing her and allowing the mists—which were now desperate for a host,\nsince Preservation's last wisp was gone—to finally pour themselves into her.\n79\nSOMETHING CHANGED.\nVin arose from her contemplation of the world. Something important was happening. She didn't have\nenough experience to tell what it was immediately, but she did see Ruin's nexus suddenly shoot away.\nShe followed. Speed wasn't an issue. In fact, she didn't even really feel like she was moving. She\n\"followed\" because that was how her mind interpreted the experience of instantly moving her\nconsciousness to the place where Ruin had focused his.\nShe recognized the area. The Pits of Hathsin, or a place nearby. As a portion of her mind had noticed\nearlier, the Pits themselves had become a massive refugee camp, the people there quickly consuming the\nresources that the Terris people had carefully stored. A part of her smiled. The Terris gave of their goods\nfreely, helping those who had fled Luthadel. The Lord Ruler had worked to breed the Terris so they\nwere docile. However, had he expected that in making his perfect servants, he would also create a\nthoughtful, kindly people who would give of their last flocks to help those who were starving?\nThe thing that she'd noticed earlier didn't have to do with the Terris or their guests.

They were coming from the center of the shining area. It\nwas to the side of the Pits, only a few minutes' travel from the refugees.\nOh, no . . .

In a place that\nalready shines because of the large number of metal deposits. Ruin would never have been able to\nknow where the atium was.\nThe depth of the Lord Ruler's strategies amazed her. He had held on for a thousand years, maintaining\nsuch an amazing secret, keeping atium safe. She imagined obligators communicating only on metal plates,\ngiving instructions for the operations at the Pits. She imagined caravans traveling from the Pits, carrying\natium mixed with gold and coins to hide where it was moving and what exactly was going on.\nYou don't know what I do for mankind, the Lord Ruler had said.\nAnd I didn't, Vin thought. Thank you.\nShe felt Ruin surge with power, and she blocked him. But just as she had been able to get a tendril of\npower past Ruin to Elend, Ruin was able to get the tiniest thread through. It was enough, for the one who\nhad spoken was tainted with Hemalurgy. A spike in each shoulder drew Ruin's power and allowed him\nto speak to their bearer.\nA kandra? Vin thought, her senses finally managing to peer through the atium glare to see a creature\nwith a translucent body standing in a cavern, just beneath the ground. Another kandra was crawling out\nof a hole nearby, carrying a small pouch of atium.\nRuin seized control of the kandra KanPaar. The creature stiffened, his metal spikes betraying him.\nSpeak of this, Ruin said to KanPaar, Vin feeling his words as they pulsed into the kandra. How much\natium is there?\n\"Wha . . . who are you?\" KanPaar said. \"Why are you in my head?\"\nI am God, the voice said. And you are mine.\nAll of you are mine.\nElend landed outside the Pits of Hathsin, throwing up a puff of ash. Oddly, some of his own soldiers were\nthere, guarding the perimeter. They rushed forward, spears held anxiously, then froze when they\nrecognized him.\n\"Lord Venture?\" one of the men asked with shock.\n\"I know you,\" Elend said, frowning. \"From my army at Fadrex.\"\n\"You sent us back, my lord,\" the other soldier said. \"With General Demoux.

Some time had passed during his travel to the\nPits from Luthadel. If time were now passing normally, the night was halfway through. What would\nhappen when the sun rose again?\n\"Quickly,\" Elend said. \"I need to speak with the leaders of this camp.\"\nThe return of the First Generation was accomplished with as much flair as Sazed had hoped. The old\nkandra, now wearing larger bodies, still bore the distinctive colorings and aged skin of their generation.\nHe had feared that the ordinary kandra would not recognize them. However, he hadn't counted on the\nlong life spans of the kandra people. Even if the Firsts only emerged once every century, most of the\nkandra would have seen them several times.\nSazed smiled as the group of Firsts moved into the main kandra chamber, continuing to cause shock\nand surprise in the others. They proclaimed KanPaar had betrayed them and imprisoned them, then\ncalled the kandra people to assemble. Sazed stayed back behind MeLaan and the others, watching for\nsnags in their plan.\nTo the side, he saw a familiar kandra approaching.\n\"Keeper,\" TenSoon said, still wearing the body of a Fifth. \"We need to be careful. There are strange\nthings afoot.\"\n\"Such as?\" Sazed asked.\nThen, TenSoon attacked him.\nSazed started, and his moment of confusion cost him dearly. TenSoon—or whoever it was—got his\nhands around Sazed's throat and began to choke him. They fell backward, drawing the attention of the\nsurrounding kandra. Sazed's assailant—bearing bones of rock—weighed far more than Sazed, and was\neasily able to roll to the top, his hands still on Sazed's neck.\n\"TenSoon?\" MeLaan asked, sounding terrified.\nIt's not him, Sazed thought. It can't be. . . .\n\"Keeper,\" his assailant said between clenched teeth. \"Something is very wrong.\"\nYou're telling me! Sazed tried to gasp for breath, reaching toward the pocket of his robe, struggling to\ngrab the metalmind lock inside.\n\"I can barely keep myself from crushing your throat right now,\" the kandra continued. \"Something has\ncontrol of me. It wants me to kill you.\"\nYou're doing a pretty good job! Sazed thought.\n\"I'm sorry,\" TenSoon said.\nThe Firsts had gathered around them. Sazed was barely able to focus, panic controlling him as he\nfought a much stronger, much heavier foe. He grabbed hold of his impromptu steelmind, but only then\nrealized that speed would do him little good when he was being held so tightly.\n\"It has come, then,\" whispered Haddek, leader of the Firsts. Sazed barely noticed as one of the other\nFirsts began to shake. People were crying out but the blood thumping in Sazed's ears kept him from\nhearing what they were saying.\nHaddek turned away from the gasping Sazed.

Then, with his free hand, the kandra reached toward his own\nshoulder.\nSazed blacked out.\nThe kandra people always said they were of Preservation, while the koloss and Inquisitors were of\nRuin. Yet, the kandra bore Hemalurgic spikes, just like the others. Was their claim, then, simple\ndelusion?\nNo, I think not. They were created by the Lord Ruler to be spies. When they said such things,\nmost of us interpreted that as meaning he planned to use them as spies in his new government,\nbecause of their ability to imitate other people. Indeed, they were used for this purpose.\nBut I see something much more grand in their existence. They were the Lord Ruler's double\nagents, planted with Hemalurgic spikes, yet trusted—taught, bound—to pull them free when Ruin\ntried to seize them. In Ruin's moment of triumph, when he'd always assumed the kandra would be\nhis on a whim, the vast majority of them immediately switched sides and left him unable to seize\nhis prize.\nThey were of Preservation all along.\n80\n\"THE TERRISMEN DID A GOOD job with this place, my lord,\" Demoux said.\nElend nodded, walking through the quiet nighttime camp with hands clasped behind his back. He was\nglad he'd stopped to change into a fresh white uniform before leaving Fadrex. As it was supposed to, the\nclothing attracted attention. The people seemed to take hope simply from seeing him. Their lives had\nbeen cast into chaos—they needed to know that their leader was aware of their situation.\n\"The camp is enormous, as you can see,\" Demoux continued. \"Several hundred thousand people now\nlive here. Without the Terrismen, I doubt that the refugees would have survived. As it is, they managed to\nkeep sickness to a minimum, to organize crews to filter and bring fresh water to the camp, and to\ndistribute food and blankets.\"\nDemoux hesitated, glancing at Elend. \"Food is running out, however,\" the general said quietly.\nApparently, when he'd discovered that Penrod was dead and that most of Luthadel's population was at\nthe Pits, he decided to keep his men there to help.\nThey passed another campfire, and the people there rose. They watched Elend and his general with\nhope. At this campfire, Demoux stopped as a young Terris-woman approached and handed him and\nElend some warm tea to drink. Her eyes lingered fondly on Demoux, and he thanked her by name. The\nTerris people were affectionate toward Demoux—they were thankful to him for bringing soldiers to help\norganize and police the mass of refugees.\nThe people needed leadership and order in these times. \"I shouldn't have left Luthadel,\" Elend said\nquietly.\nDemoux didn't respond immediately. The two of them finished their tea, then continued on, walking\nwith an honor guard of about ten soldiers, all from Demoux's group. The general had sent several\nmessengers back to Elend. They had never arrived. Perhaps they hadn't been able to get around the lava"

Perhaps they hadn't been able to get around the lava\nfield. Or perhaps they had run afoul of the very same army of koloss Elend had passed on his way to\nLuthadel.\nThose koloss . . . Elend thought. The ones we drove away from Fadrex, plus more, are coming\ndirectly in this direction. There are even more people here than there were in Fadrex. And they\ndon't have a city wall, or many soldiers at all, to protect them.\n\"Have you been able to figure out what happened in Luthadel, Demoux?\" Elend asked quietly, pausing\nin a darkened area between campfires. It still felt so strange to be out with no mists to obscure the night.\nHe could see so much further—yet, oddly, the night didn't seem as bright.\n\"Penrod, my lord,\" Demoux said softly. \"They say he went mad. He began finding traitors in the\nnobility, even within his own army. He divided the city, and it turned into another house war. Almost all of\nthe soldiers killed one another, and the city half burned down. The majority of the people escaped, but\nthey have very little by way of protection. A determined group of bandits could probably wreak havoc\non this whole group.\"\nElend fell silent. House war, he thought with frustration. Ruin, using our own tricks against us.\nThat's the same method Kelsier used to seize the city.\n\"My lord . . .\" Demoux said tentatively.\n\"Speak,\" Elend said.\n\"You were right to send me and my men back,\" Demoux said. \"The Survivor is behind this, my lord.\nHe wanted us here for some reason.\"\nElend frowned. \"What makes you say that?\"\n\"These people,\" Demoux said, \"they fled Luthadel because of Kelsier. He appeared to a pair of\nsoldiers, then a group of people, in the city. They say he'd told them to be ready for disaster, and to lead\nthe people out of the city. It's because of them that so many escaped. Those two soldiers and their\nfriends had supplies prepared, and they had the presence of mind to come here.\"\nElend's frown deepened. Yet, he had seen too much to reject even such a strange story. \"Send for\nthese men,\" he said.\nDemoux nodded, waving for a soldier.\n\"Also,\" Elend said, remembering that Demoux and his men had been sick from the mists, \"see if\nanyone here has any Allomantic metals. Pass them out to your soldiers and have them ingest them.\"\n\"My lord?\" Demoux said, confused, as he turned.\n\"It's a long story, Demoux,\" Elend said. \"Suffice it to say that your god—or somebody—has made you\nand your men into Allomancers. Divide your men by the metal it turns out they can burn. We're going to\nneed all of the Coinshots, Thugs, and Lurchers we can get.\"\nSazed's eyes fluttered open, and he shook his head, groaning. How long had he been out? Probably not"

Probably not\nlong, he realized, as his vision cleared. He'd passed out from lack of air. That kind of thing usually only\nleft one unconscious for a short time.\nAssuming one woke up at all.\nWhich I did, he thought, coughing and rubbing his throat, sitting up. The kandra cavern glowed with\nthe quiet light of its blue phosphorescent lanterns. By that light, he could see that he was surrounded by\nsomething strange.\nMistwraiths. The cousins of the kandra, the scavengers that hunted at night and fed on corpses. They\nmoved about Sazed, masses of muscle, flesh, and bone—but with those bones combined in strange,\nunnatural ways. Feet hanging off at angles, heads connected to arms. Ribs used like legs.\nExcept, these bones were not actually bone at all, but stone, metal, or wood. Sazed stood up solemnly\nas he looked over the remnants of the kandra people. Littered across the floor, among the jumbled mass\nof mistwraiths—who oozed about like giant, translucent slugs—were discarded spikes. Kandra\nBlessings. The things that had brought them sentience.\nThey had done it. They had held to their oath, and had removed their spikes rather than be taken over\nby Ruin. Sazed looked over them with pity, amazement, and respect.\nThe atium, he thought. They did this to stop Ruin from getting the atium. I have to protect it!\nHe stumbled away from the main chamber, regaining his strength as he made his way to the\nTrustwarren. He paused, however, as he approached, noticing sounds. He peeked around a corner, and\nlooked down the corridor through the open Trustwarren doorway. Inside, he found a group of\nkandra—perhaps twenty in number—working to push back the plate on the floor that covered the atium.\nOf course they didn't all become mistwraiths, he thought. Some would have been outside of the\nhearing of the Firsts, or wouldn't have had the courage to pull their spikes free. In fact, as he thought\nabout it, he was even more impressed that so many had obeyed the command from the First Generation.\nSazed easily recognized KanPaar directing the work inside. The kandra would take the atium and\nwould deliver it to Ruin. Sazed had to stop them. But it was twenty against one—with Sazed having only\none small metalmind. It didn't seem like good odds for him.\nHowever, then Sazed noticed something sitting outside the doors of the Trust-warren. A simple cloth\nsack, of little note save for the fact that Sazed recognized it. He'd carried his metalminds in it for years.\nThey must have tossed it there after taking Sazed captive. It lay about twenty feet down the corridor\nfrom him, right beside the doorway into the Trustwarren.\nIn the other room, KanPaar looked up, staring directly toward Sazed's position. Ruin had noticed him.\nSazed didn't pause to think further. He reached into his pocket, grabbed the steel lock, and tapped it."

He reached into his pocket, grabbed the steel lock, and tapped it.\nHe rushed through the corridor on inhumanly quick feet, snatching his sack from the ground as kandra\nbegan to cry out.\nSazed snapped open the sack, and found a collection of bracelets, rings, and bracers inside. He\ndumped them out, spilling the precious metalminds to the floor and grabbed two particular ones. Then,\nstill moving at blurring speed, he dashed to the side.\nHis steelmind ran out. One of the rings he'd grabbed was pewter. He tapped it for strength, growing in\nsize and bulk. Then, he slammed the doors to the Trustwarren closed, causing those now trapped inside\nto cry out in shock. Finally, he tapped the other ring—this one iron. He grew several times heavier,\nmaking himself into a doorstop, holding the massive metal doors to the Trustwarren closed.\nIt was a delaying tactic. He stood, holding the doors shut, his metalminds depleting at an alarming rate.\nThey were the same rings he'd worn at the siege of Luthadel, the ones that had been embedded within\nhim. He'd replenished them following the siege, before he'd given up Feruchemy. They would not last\nlong. What would he do when the kandra burst through the door? He searched desperately for a way to\nbar or block the portal, but could see nothing. And, if he let go for even a moment, the kandra inside\nwould burst free.\n\"Please,\" he whispered, hoping that—like before—the thing that listened would give him a miracle.\n\"I'm going to need help. . . .\"\n\"I swear it was him, my lord,\" said the soldier, a man named Rittle. \"I've believed in the Church of the\nSurvivor since the day of Kelsier's own death, my lord. He preached to me, converted me to the\nrebellion. I was there when he visited the caves and had Lord Demoux fight for his honor. I'd know\nKelsier like I'd know my father. It was the Survivor.\"\nElend turned to the other soldier, who nodded in agreement. \"I didn't know him, my lord,\" said this\nman. \"However, he matched the descriptions. I think it was really him, I do.\"\nElend turned to Demoux, who nodded. \"They described Lord Kelsier very accurately, my lord. He is\nwatching over us.\"\nElend. . . .\nA messenger arrived and whispered something to Demoux. The night was dark, and in the torchlight,\nElend turned to study the two soldiers who had seen Kelsier. They didn't look like highly reliable\nwitnesses—Elend hadn't exactly left his best soldiers behind when he'd gone campaigning. Still, others\nhad apparently seen the Survivor too. Elend would want to speak with them.\nHe shook his head. And, where in the world was Vin?\nElend. . . .\n\"My lord,\" Demoux said, touching his arm, looking concerned. Elend dismissed the two soldier\nwitnesses. Accurate or not, he owed them a great debt—they had saved many lives with their\npreparation.\n\"Scout's report, my lord,\" Demoux said, face illuminated by a pole-top torch flickering in the night"

Why did he keep hearing his name on the wind? He turned, looking into the darkness.\nSomething was pulling him, guiding him, whispering to him. He tried to ignore it, turning back to Demoux.\nAnd yet, it was there, in his heart.\nCome. . . .\nIt seemed like Vin's voice.\n\"Gather an honor guard,\" Elend said, grabbing the torch by its shaft, then throwing on an ashcloak and\nbuttoning it down to his knees. Then, he turned toward the darkness.\n\"My lord?\" Demoux said.\n\"Just do it!\" Elend said, striding off into the darkness.\nDemoux called for some soldiers, following in a hurry.\nWhat am I doing? Elend thought, pushing his way through the waist-deep ash, using the cloak to\nkeep his uniform somewhat clean. Chasing at dreams? Maybe I'm going mad.\nHe could see something in his mind. A hillside with a hole in it. A memory, perhaps? Had he come this\nway before? Demoux and his soldiers followed quietly, looking apprehensive.\nElend pushed onward. He was almost—\nHe stopped. There it was, the hillside. It would have been indistinguishable from the others around it,\nexcept there were tracks leading up to it. Elend frowned, pushing forward through the deep ash, moving\nto the point where the tracks ended. There, he found a hole in the ground, leading down.\nA cave, he thought. Perhaps . . . a place for my people to hide?\nIt wouldn't be big enough for that, likely. Still, the caves Kelsier had used for his rebellion had been\nlarge enough to hold some ten thousand men. Curious, Elend poked down into the cave, walking down\nits steep incline, throwing off the cloak. Demoux and his men followed with curiosity.\nThe tunnel went down for a bit, and Elend was surprised to find that there was light coming from\nahead. Immediately, he flared pewter, growing tense. He tossed aside his torch, then burned tin,\nenhancing his vision. He could see several poles that glowed blue at the top. They appeared to be made\nof rock.\nWhat in the world . . .?\nHe moved forward quickly, motioning for Demoux and his men to follow. The tunnel led to a vast\ncavern. Elend stopped. It was as large as one of the storage caverns. Larger, perhaps. Down below,\nsomething moved.\nMistwraiths? he realized with surprise. Is this where they hide? In holes in the ground?\nHe dropped a coin, shooting himself through the poorly lit cavern to land on the stone floor a distance\naway from Demoux and the others.

Stone against metal. He waved sharply to Demoux, then moved carefully down\na side corridor.\nAt its end, he stopped in surprise. A familiar figure stood against a pair of large metal doors, grunting,\napparently trying to hold them closed.\n\"Sazed?\" Elend asked, standing up straighter.\nSazed looked up, saw Elend, and was apparently so surprised that he lost control of the doors. They\nburst open, throwing the Terrisman aside, revealing a group of angry, translucent-skinned kandra.\n\"Your Majesty!\" Sazed said. \"Do not let them escape!\"\nDemoux and his soldiers clanked up behind Elend. That's either Sazed, or a kandra who ate his\nbones, Elend thought. He made a snap decision. He'd trusted the voice in his ear. He'd trust that this was\nSazed.\nThe group of kandra tried to get past Demoux's soldiers. However, the kandra weren't particularly\ngood warriors, and their weapons were made of metal. It took Elend and Demoux all of about two\nminutes to subdue the group, breaking their bones to keep them from healing and escaping.\nAfterward, Elend walked over to Sazed, who had stood up and dusted himself off. \"How did you find\nme, Your Majesty?\"\n\"I honestly don't know,\" Elend said. \"Sazed, what is this place?\"\n\"The Homeland of the kandra people, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. \"And the hiding place of the Lord\nRuler's atium hoard.\"\nElend raised an eyebrow, following Sazed's pointed finger. There was a room beyond the doors, and\na pit in the floor.\nGreat, Elend thought. Now we find it.\n\"You don't look too excited, Your Majesty,\" Sazed noted. \"Kings, armies, Mistborn—even Kelsier\nhimself—have been searching for this cache for years.\"\n\"It's worthless,\" Elend said. \"My people are starving, and they can't eat metal. This cavern, however . .\n. it might prove useful. What do you think, Demoux?\"\n\"If there are any other chambers like that first one, my lord, it could hold a substantial percentage of\nour people.\"\n\"There are four large caverns,\" Sazed said. \"And four entrances that I know of.\"\nElend turned to Demoux. He was already giving orders to his soldiers. We have to get the people\ndown here before the sun rises, Elend thought, remembering the heat. At the very least, before those\nkoloss arrive.\nAfter that . . . well, they would have to see. For now, Elend had only one goal.\nSurvival.\nSnapping has always been the dark side of Allomancy. A person's genetic endowment may make\nthem a potential Allomancer, but in order for the power to manifest, the body must be put through\nextraordinary trauma. Though Elend spoke of how terrible his beating was, during our day,\nunlocking Allomancy in a person was easier than it had once been, for we had the infusion of\nPreservation's power into the human bloodlines via the nuggets granted to nobility by the Lord\nRuler."

In those early\ndays, before the Ascension, the mists began to Snap people as they did during our time—but this\naction of the mists was one of the only ways to awaken Allomancy in a person, for the genetic\nattributes were buried too deeply to be brought out by a simple beating. The mists of that day\ncreated Mistings only, of course—there were no Mistborn until the Lord Ruler made use of the\nnuggets.\nThe people misinterpreted the mists' intent, as the process of Snapping Allomancers caused\nsome—particularly the young and the old—to die. This hadn't been Preservation's desire, but he'd\ngiven up most of his consciousness to form Ruin's prison, and the mists had to be left to work as\nbest they could without specific direction.\nRuin, subtle as ever, knew that he couldn't stop the mists from doing their work. However, he\ncould do the unexpected and encourage them. And so, he helped make them stronger. That\nbrought death to the plants of the world, and created the threat that became known as the\nDeepness.\n81\nVIN TURNED TOWARD RUIN, projecting a smile. The cloud of twisting black mist seemed\nagitated.\nSo, you can influence a single minion, Ruin snapped, turning upon itself, rising in the air. Vin\nfollowed, streaking up to loom over the entire Central Dominance. Below, she could see Demoux's\nsoldiers rushing to the camp, waking the people, organizing them to flight. Already, some of them were\nmaking their way along the tracks in the ash toward the safety of the caverns.\nShe could feel the sun, and knew that the planet was far too near it to be safe. Yet, she could do\nnothing more. Not only would Ruin have stopped her, but she didn't understand her power yet. She felt\nas the Lord Ruler must have—almighty, yet clumsy. If she tried to move the world, she would only make\nthings worse.\nBut, she had accomplished something. Ruin had his koloss pounding toward them at breakneck speed,\nbut they still wouldn't arrive at the Pits for several hours. Plenty of time to get the people to the caverns.\nRuin must have noticed what she was studying, or perhaps he sensed her smugness. You think you've\nwon? he asked, sounding amused. Why, because you managed to stop a few kandra? They were\nalways the weakest of the minions the Lord Ruler created for me. I have made a habit of ignoring\nthem. Either way, Vin, you cannot really think that you have beaten me.\nVin waited, watching as the people fled to the relative safety of the caverns. Even as the bulk of them\narrived—soldiers separating them into groups, sending them to the different entrances—her good humor\nbegan to fade. She had managed to get through to Elend, and while it had seemed like a great victory at\nthe moment, she could now see that it was little more than another stalling tactic."

Ruin asked. I've made them from your people,\nyou know. I've gathered hundreds of thousands.\nVin focused, enumerating instantly. He was telling the truth.\nThis is the force I could have thrown at you at any time, Ruin said. Most of them kept to the\nOuter Dominances, but I've been bringing them in, marching them toward Luthadel. How many\ntimes must I tell you, Vin? You can't win. You could never win. I've just been playing with you.\nVin pulled back, ignoring his lies. He hadn't been playing with them—he'd been trying to discover the\nsecrets that Preservation had left, the secret that the Lord Ruler had kept. Still, the numbers Ruin had\nfinally managed to marshal were awe-inspiring. There were far more koloss than there were people\nclimbing into the caverns. With a force like that, Ruin could assault even a well-fortified position. And, by\nVin's count, Elend had fewer than a thousand men with any battle training.\nOn top of that, there was the sun and its destructive heat, the death of the world's crops, the tainting of\nwater and land with several feet of ash . . . Even the lava flows, which she had stopped, were beginning\nagain, her plugging of the ashmounts having provided only a temporary solution. A bad one, even. Now\nthat the mountains couldn't erupt, great cracks were appearing in the land, and the magma, the earth's\nburning blood, was boiling out that way.\nWe're just so far behind! Vin thought. Ruin had centuries to plan this. Even when we thought we\nwere being clever, we fell for his plots. What good is it to sequester my people beneath the ground\nif they're just going to starve?\nShe turned toward Ruin, who sat billowing and shifting upon himself, watching his koloss army. She\nfelt a hatred that seemed incompatible with the power she held. The hatred made her sick, but she didn't\nlet go of it.\nThis thing before her . . . it would destroy everything she knew, everything she loved. It couldn't\nunderstand love. It built only so that it could destroy. At that moment, she reversed her earlier decision.\nShe'd never again call Ruin a \"him.\" Humanizing the creature gave it too much respect.\nSeething, watching, she didn't know what else to do. So, she attacked.\nShe wasn't even certain how she did it. She threw herself at Ruin, forcing her power up against its\npower. There was friction between them, a clash of energy, and it tormented her divine body. Ruin cried\nout, and—mixing with Ruin—she knew its mind.\nRuin was surprised. It didn't expect Preservation to be able to attack. Vin's move smacked too much\nof destruction. Ruin didn't know how to respond, but it threw its power back against her in a protective\nreflex. Their selves crashed, threatening to dissolve. Finally, Vin pulled back, lacerated, rebuffed.\nTheir power was too well matched. Opposite, yet similar. Like Allomancy."

He held it up\nnext to the one that Yomen had given him.\n\"Indeed, Your Majesty,\" Sazed said. The Terrisman looked eager. Didn't he understand how\ndangerous their situation was? Demoux's scouts—the ones that had returned—reported that the koloss\nwere only minutes away. Elend had ordered his troops posted at the doorways to the Homeland, but his\nhope—that the koloss wouldn't know where to find his people—was a slim one, considering what Sazed\nhad told him about Ruin.\n\"Ruin can't help but come for it,\" Sazed explained. They stood in the metal-lined cavern called the\nTrustwarren, the place where the kandra had spent the last thousand years gathering and guarding the\natium. \"This atium is part of him. It's what he's been searching for all this time.\"\n\"Which means we'll have a couple hundred thousand koloss trying to climb down our throats, Sazed,\"\nElend said, handing back the bead of atium. \"I say we give it to him.\"\nSazed paled. \"Give it to him? Your Majesty, my apologies, but that would mean the end of the world.\nInstantly. I am certain of it.\"\nGreat, Elend thought.\n\"It will be all right, Elend,\" Sazed said.\nElend frowned up at the Terrisman, who stood peacefully in his robes.\n\"Vin will come,\" Sazed explained. \"She is the Hero of Ages—she will arrive to save this people. Don't\nyou see how perfect this all is? It's arranged, planned. That you would come here, find me, at this exact\nmoment . . . That you'd be able to lead the people to safety in these caverns . . . Well, it all fits together.\nShe'll come.\"\nInteresting time for him to get his faith back, Elend thought. He rolled Yomen's bead between his\nfingers, thinking. Outside the room, he could hear whispers. People—Terris stewards, skaa leaders, even\na few soldiers—stood listening. Elend could hear the anxiety in their voices. They had heard of the\napproaching army. As Elend watched, Demoux carefully pushed his way through them and entered the\nroom.\n\"Soldiers posted, my lord,\" the general said.\n\"How many do we have?\" Elend asked.\nDemoux looked grim. \"The two hundred and eighty I brought with me,\" he said. \"Plus about five\nhundred from the city. Another hundred ordinary citizens that we armed with those kandra hammers, or\nspare weapons from our soldiers. And, we have four different entrances to this cavern complex we need\nto guard.\"\nElend closed his eyes.\n\"She'll come,\" Sazed said.\n\"My lord,\" Demoux said, pulling Elend aside. \"This is bad.\"\n\"I know,\" Elend said, exhaling softly. \"Did you give the men metals?\""

He'd failed back during the siege of Luthadel—it had\ntaken Vin to protect the city. He'd failed in Fadrex City—only the koloss getting distracted had rescued\nhim there.\nA ruler's most basic duty was to protect his people. In this one area, Elend continually felt impotent.\nUseless.\nWhy can't I do it? Elend thought with frustration. I spend a year searching out storage caverns to\nprovide food, only to end up trapped with my people starving. I search all that time looking for\nthe atium—hoping to use it to buy safety for my people—and then I find it too late to spend it on\nanything.\nToo late. . . .\nHe paused, glancing back toward the metal plate in the floor.\nYears searching for . . . atium.\nNone of the metals Demoux had given his soldiers had worked. Elend had been working under the\nassumption that Demoux's group would be like the other mistfallen back in Urteau—that they'd be\ncomposed of all kinds of Mistings. Yet, there had been something different about Demoux's group. They\nhad fallen sick for far longer than the others.\nElend pushed forward, rushing past Sazed, grabbing a handful of beads. A vast wealth, unlike anything\nany man had ever possessed. Valuable for its rarity. Valuable for its economic power. Valuable for its\nAllomancy.\n\"Demoux,\" he snapped, rising and tossing the bead to him. \"Eat this.\"\nDemoux frowned. \"My lord?\"\n\"Eat it,\" Elend said.\nDemoux did as asked. He stood for a moment."

Sent away from my army because of all the ones\nwho fell sick, they were the most sick. Sixteen days.\nTwo hundred and eighty men. One-sixteenth of those who fell sick. One out of sixteen\nAllomantic metals.\nYomen had proven that there was such a thing as an atium Misting. If Elend hadn't been so distracted,\nhe would have made the connection earlier. If one out of sixteen who fell sick remained that way the\nlongest, would that not imply that they'd gained the most powerful of the sixteen abilities?\nDemoux looked up, eyes widening.\nAnd Elend smiled.\nVin hovered outside the cavern, watching with dread as the koloss approached. They were already in a\nblood frenzy—Ruin had that much control over them. There were thousands upon thousands of them.\nThe slaughter was about to begin.\nVin cried out as they drew closer, throwing herself against Ruin again, trying to drive her power to\ndestroy the thing. As before, she was rebuffed. She felt herself screaming, trembling as she thought about\nthe impending deaths below. It would be like the tsunami deaths on the coast, only worse.\nFor these were people she knew. People she loved.\nShe turned back toward the entrance. She didn't want to watch, but she wouldn't be able to do\nanything else. Her self was everywhere. Even if she pulled her nexus away, she knew that she'd still feel\nthe deaths—that they would make her tremble and weep.\nFrom within the cavern, echoing, she sensed a familiar voice. \"Today, men, I ask of you your lives.\"\nVin hovered down, listening, though she couldn't see into the cavern because of the metals in the rock.\nShe could hear, however. If she'd had eyes, she would have been crying, she knew.\n\"I ask of you your lives,\" Elend said, voice echoing, \"and your courage. I ask of you your faith, and\nyour honor—your strength, and your compassion. For today, I lead you to die. I will not ask you to\nwelcome this event. I will not insult you by calling it well, or just, or even glorious. But I will say this.\n\"Each moment you fight is a gift to those in this cavern. Each second we fight is a second longer that\nthousands of people can draw breath. Each stroke of the sword, each koloss felled, each breath earned\nis a victory! It is a person protected for a moment longer, a life extended, an enemy frustrated!\"\nThere was a brief pause.\n\"In the end, they will kill us,\" Elend said, voice loud, ringing in the cavern. \"But first, they shall fear us!\"\nThe men yelled at this, and Vin's enhanced mind could pick out around two hundred and fifty distinct\nvoices. She heard them split, rushing toward the different cavern entrances. A moment later, someone\nappeared from the front entrance near her.\nA figure in white slowly stepped out into the ash, brilliant white cape fluttering. He held a sword in one\nhand.\nElend! she tried to cry at him. No! Go back! Charging them is madness! You'll be killed!"

You'll be killed!\nElend stood tall, watching the waves of koloss as they approached, trampling down the black ash, an\nendless sea of death with blue skin and red eyes. Many carried swords, the others just bore rocks and\nlengths of wood. Elend was a tiny white speck before them, a single dot on an endless canvas of blue.\nHe raised his sword high and charged.\nELEND!\nSuddenly, Elend burst with a brilliant energy, so bright that Vin gasped. He met the first koloss\nhead-on, ducking beneath the swinging sword and decapitating the creature in one stroke. Then, instead\nof jumping away, he spun to the side, swinging. Another koloss fell. Three swords flashed around him,\nbut all missed by just a breath. Elend ducked to the side, taking a koloss in the stomach, then whipped\nhis sword around—his head barely passing beneath another swing—and took off a koloss arm.\nHe still didn't Push himself away. Vin froze, watching as he took down one koloss, then beheaded\nanother in a single, fluid stroke. Elend moved with a grace she had never seen from him—she had always\nbeen the better warrior, yet at this moment, he put her to shame. He wove between koloss blades as if he\nwere taking part in a prerehearsed stage fight, body after body falling before his gliding blade.\nA group of soldiers in Elend's colors burst from the cavern entrance, charging. Like a wave of light,\ntheir forms exploded with power. They, too, moved into the koloss ranks, striking with incredible\nprecision. Not a single one of them fell as Vin watched. They fought with miraculous skill and fortune,\neach koloss blade falling just a little too late. Blue corpses began to pile up around the glowing force of\nmen.\nSomehow, Elend had found an entire army who could burn atium.\nElend was a god.\nHe'd never burned atium before, and his first experience with the metal filled him with wonder. The\nkoloss around him all emitted atium shadows—images that moved before they did, showing Elend\nexactly what they would do. He could see into the future, if only a few seconds. In a battle, that was just\nwhat one needed.\nHe could feel the atium enhancing his mind, making him capable of reading and using all of the new\ninformation. He didn't even have to pause and think. His arms moved of their own volition, swinging his\nsword with awesome precision.\nHe spun amid a cloud of phantom images, striking at flesh, feeling almost as if he were in the mists\nagain. No koloss could stand against him. He felt energized—he felt amazing. For a time, he was\ninvincible. He'd swallowed so many atium beads he felt as if he'd throw up. For its entire history, atium\nhad been a thing that men had needed to save and hoard. Burning it had seemed such a shame that it had\nbeen used only sparingly, only in instances of great need.\nElend didn't need to worry about any of that. He just burned as much as he wanted. And it made him\ninto a disaster for the koloss—a whirlwind of exact strikes and impossible dodges, always a few steps"

And, when he began to get low on atium, he\nPushed himself off a fallen sword back to the entrance. There, with plenty of water to wash it down,\nSazed waited with another bag of atium.\nElend downed the beads quickly, then returned to the battle.\nRuin raged and spun, trying to stop the slaughter. Yet, this time, Vin was the force of balance. She\nblocked Ruin's every attempt to destroy Elend and the others, keeping it contained.\nI can't decide if you're a fool, Vin thought toward it, or if you simply exist in a way that makes\nyou incapable of considering some things.\nRuin screamed, buffeting against her, trying to destroy her as she had tried to destroy it. However,\nonce again, their powers were too evenly matched. Ruin was forced to pull back.\nLife, Vin said. You said that the only reason to create something was so that you could destroy it\n.\nShe hovered beside Elend, watching him fight. The deaths of the koloss should have pained her. Yet,\nshe did not think of the death. Perhaps it was the influence of Preservation's power, but she saw only a\nman, struggling, fighting, even when hope seemed impossible. She didn't see death, she saw life. She saw\nfaith.\nWe create things to watch them grow, Ruin, she said. To take pleasure in seeing that which we\nlove become more than it was before. You said that you were invincible—that all things break\napart. All things are Ruined. But there are things that fight against you—and the ironic part is,\nyou can't even understand those things. Love. Life. Growth.\nThe life of a person is more than the chaos of its passing. Emotion, Ruin. This is your defeat.\nSazed watched anxiously from the mouth of the cavern. A small group of men huddled around him. Garv,\nleader of the Church of the Survivor in Luthadel. Harathdal, foremost of the Terris stewards. Lord Dedri\nVasting, one of the surviving Assembly members from the city government. Aslydin, the young woman\nwhom Demoux had apparently come to love during his few short weeks at the Pits of Hathsin. A\nsmattering of others, important—or faithful—enough to get near the front of the crowd and watch.\n\"Where is she, Master Terrisman?\" Garv asked.\n\"She'll come,\" Sazed promised, hand resting on the rock wall. The men fell quiet. Soldiers—those\nwithout the blessing of atium—waited nervously with them, knowing they were next in line, should Elend's\nassault fail.\nShe has to come, Sazed thought. Everything points toward her arrival.\n\"The Hero will come,\" he repeated.\nElend sheared through two heads at once, dropping the koloss. He spun his blade, taking off an arm,\nthen stabbed another koloss through the neck. He hadn't seen that one approaching, but his mind had\nseen and interpreted the atium shadow before the real attack came."

He hadn't seen that one approaching, but his mind had\nseen and interpreted the atium shadow before the real attack came.\nAlready he stood atop of carpet of blue corpses. He did not stumble. With atium, his every step was\nexact, his blade guided, his mind crisp. He took down a particularly large koloss, then stepped back,\npausing briefly.\nThe sun crested the horizon in the east. It started to grow hotter.\nThey had been fighting for hours, yet the army of koloss still seemed endless. Elend slew another\nkoloss, but his motions were beginning to feel sluggish. Atium enhanced the mind, but it did not boost the\nbody, and he'd started to rely on his pewter to keep him going. Who would have known that one could\nget tired—exhausted, even—while burning atium? Nobody had ever used as much of the metal as Elend\nhad.\nBut he had to keep going. His atium was running low. He turned back toward the mouth of the cavern,\njust in time to see one of his atium soldiers go down in a spray of blood.\nElend cursed, spinning as an atium shadow passed through him. He ducked the swing that followed,\nthen took off the creature's arm. He beheaded the one that followed, then cut another's legs out from\nbeneath it. For most of the battle, he hadn't used fancy Allomantic jumps or attacks, just straightforward\nswordplay. His arms were growing tired, however, and he was forced to begin Pushing koloss away\nfrom him to manage the battlefield. The reserve of atium—of life—within him was dwindling. Atium\nburned so quickly.\nAnother man screamed. Another soldier dead.\nElend began to back toward the cavern. There were just so many koloss. His band of two hundred\nand eighty had slain thousands, yet the koloss didn't care. They kept attacking, a brutal wave of endless\ndetermination, resisted only by the pockets of atium Mistings protecting each of the entrances to the\nHomeland.\nAnother man died. They were running out of atium.\nElend screamed, swinging his sword about him, taking down three koloss in a maneuver that never\nshould have worked. He flared steel and Pushed the rest away from him.\nThe body of a god, burning within me, he thought. He gritted his teeth, attacking as more of his men\nfell. He scrambled up a pile of koloss, slicing off arms, legs, heads. Stabbing chests, necks, guts. He\nfought on, alone, his clothing long since stained from white to red.\nSomething moved behind him, and he spun, raising his blade, letting the atium lead him. Yet, he froze,\nuncertain. The creature behind him was no koloss. It stood in a black robe, one eye socket empty and\nbleeding, the other bearing a spike that had been crushed back into its skull. Elend could see straight into\nthe empty eye socket, through the creature's head, and out the back.\nMarsh. He had a cloud of atium shadows around him—he was burning the metal too, and would be\nimmune to Elend's own atium.\nHuman led his koloss soldiers through the tunnels. They killed any person in their path."

Controlling him, Ruin made him\nturn away and not kill them. Not that Ruin didn't want him to kill them. It just wanted something else\nmore.\nHuman rushed forward. He crawled over tumbled rocks and stones. He shoved aside crying humans.\nOther koloss followed him. For the moment, all of his own desires were forgotten. There was only his\noverpowering desire to get to . . .\nA small room. There. In front of him. Human threw open the doors. Ruin yelled in pleasure as he\nentered this room. It contained the thing Ruin wanted.\n\"Guess what I found,\" Marsh growled, stepping up, Pushing against Elend's sword. The weapon was\nripped from his fingers, flying away. \"Atium. A kandra was carrying it, looking to sell it. Foolish creature.\"\nElend cursed, ducking out of the way of a koloss swing, pulling his obsidian dagger from the sheath at\nhis leg.\nMarsh stalked forward. Men screamed—cursing, falling—as their atium died out. Elend's soldiers\nwere being overrun. The screams tapered off as the last of his men guarding this entrance died. He\ndoubted the others would last much longer.\nElend's atium warned him of attacking koloss, letting him dodge—barely—but he couldn't kill them\nvery effectively with the dagger. And, as the koloss took his attention, Marsh struck with an obsidian axe.\nThe blade fell, and Elend leaped away, but the dodge left him off balance.\nElend tried to recover, but his metals were running low—not just his atium, but his basic metals. Iron,\nsteel, pewter. He hadn't been paying much attention to them, since he had atium, but he'd been fighting\nfor so long now. If Marsh had atium, then they were equal—and without basic metals, Elend would die.\nAn attack from the Inquisitor forced Elend to flare pewter to get away. He cut down three koloss with\nease, his atium still helping him, but Marsh's immunity was a serious challenge. The Inquisitor crawled\nover the fallen bodies of koloss, scrambling toward Elend, his single spikehead reflecting the too-bright\nlight of the sun overhead.\nElend's pewter ran out.\n\"You cannot beat me, Elend Venture,\" Marsh said in a voice like gravel. \"We've killed your wife. I will\nkill you.\"\nVin. Elend didn't believe it. Vin will come, he thought. She'll save us.\nFaith. It was a strange thing to feel at that moment.

He didn't have time to think about the oddity; he\nsimply reacted, Pulling on his sword, which lay stuck into the ground a distance away. It flipped through\nthe air and he caught it, swinging with a too-quick motion, blocking Marsh's axe. Elend's body seemed to\npulse, powerful and vast. He struck forward instinctively, forcing Marsh backward across the ashen field.\nKoloss backed away for the moment, shying from Elend, as if frightened. Or awed.\nMarsh raised a hand to Push on Elend's sword, but nothing happened. It was . . . as if something\ndeflected the blow. Elend screamed, charging, beating back Marsh with the strikes of his silvery weapon.\nThe Inquisitor looked shocked as it blocked with the obsidian axe, its motions too quick for even\nAllomancy to explain. Yet Elend still forced him to retreat, across fallen corpses of blue, ash stirring\nbeneath a red sky.\nA powerful peace swelled in Elend. His Allomancy flared bright, though he knew the metals inside of\nhim should have burned away. Only atium remained, and its strange power did not—could not—give him\nthe other metals. But it didn't matter. For a moment, he was embraced by something greater. He looked\nup, toward the sun.\nAnd he saw—just briefly—an enormous figure in the air just above him. A shifting, brilliant personage\nof pure white. Her hands held to his shoulders with her head thrown back, white hair streaming, mist\nflaring behind her like wings that stretched across the sky.\nVin, he thought with a smile.\nElend looked back down as Marsh screamed and leaped forward, attacking with his axe in one hand,\nseeming to trail something vast and black like a cloak behind him. Marsh raised his other hand across his\nface, as if to shield his dead eyes from the image in the air above Elend.\nElend burned the last of his atium, flaring it to life in his stomach. He raised his sword in two hands and\nwaited for Marsh to draw close. The Inquisitor was stronger and was a better warrior. Marsh had the\npowers of both Allomancy and Feruchemy, making him another Lord Ruler. This was not a battle Elend\ncould win. Not with a sword.\nMarsh arrived, and Elend thought he understood what it had been like for Kelsier to face the Lord\nRuler on that square in Luthadel, all those years ago. Marsh struck with his axe; Elend raised his sword in\nreturn and prepared to strike.\nThen, Elend burned duralumin with his atium.\nSight, Sound, Strength, Power, Glory, Speed!\nBlue lines sprayed from his chest like rays of light. But those were all overshadowed by one thing.\nAtium plus duralumin. In a flash of knowledge, Elend felt a mind-numbing wealth of information. All\nbecame white around him as knowledge saturated his mind.\n\"I see now,\" he whispered as the vision faded, and along with it his remaining metals. The battlefield\nreturned. He stood upon it, his sword piercing Marsh's neck. It had gotten caught on the spikehead\njutting out of Marsh's back, between the shoulder blades."

They took the pain away.\nHowever, there was only so much that pewter could do, no matter how high it was flared. Marsh ripped\nhis axe free, and Elend stumbled backward, bleeding, letting go of his sword. Marsh pulled the blade free\nfrom his neck, and the wound vanished, healed by the powers of Feruchemy.\nElend fell, slumping into a pile of koloss bodies. He would have been dead already, save for the\npewter. Marsh stepped up to him, smiling. His empty eye socket was wreathed in tattoos, the mark that\nMarsh had taken upon himself. The price he had paid to overthrow the Final Empire.\nMarsh grabbed Elend by the throat, pulling him back up. \"Your soldiers are dead, Elend Venture,\" the\ncreature whispered. \"Our koloss rampage inside the kandra caverns. Your metals are gone. You have\nlost.\"\nElend felt his life dripping away, the last trickle from an empty glass. He'd been here before, back in\nthe cavern at the Well of Ascension. He should have died then and he'd been terrified. This time, oddly,\nhe was not. There was no regret. Just satisfaction.\nElend looked up at the Inquisitor. Vin, like a glowing phantom, still hovered above them both. \"Lost?\"\nElend whispered. \"We've won, Marsh.\"\n\"Oh, and how is that?\" Marsh asked, dismissive.\nHuman stood at the side of the pit in the center of the cavern room. The pit where Ruin's body had been.\nThe place of victory.\nHuman stood, dumbfounded, a group of other koloss stepping up to him, looking equally confused.\nThe pit was empty.\n\"Atium,\" Elend whispered, tasting blood. \"Where is the atium, Marsh?

You\nmight be able to kill me, but you'll never get what you came for. And that is why we win.\"\nMarsh screamed in anger, demanding the truth, but Elend had spoken it. The deaths of the others\nmeant that they had run out of atium. His men had fought until it was gone, as Elend had commanded,\nburning away every last bit.\nThe body of a god. The power of a god. Elend had held it for a moment. More important, he'd\ndestroyed it. Hopefully, that would keep his people safe.\nIt's up to you now, Vin, he thought, still feeling the peace of her touch upon his soul.

But she\nwould not cease to function because he was gone.\nThe opposite, perhaps. Ruin floated directly above her, throwing down insults, telling her how it would\nkill the others. Sazed. Breeze. Ham. Spook.\nSo few left of the original crew, she thought. Kelsier dead so long ago. Dockson and Clubs\nslaughtered at the Battle of Luthadel. Yeden dead with his soldiers.

She forced\nit against the power of Ruin, as she had the other times. Yet, this time was different. When Ruin pushed\nback, she didn't retreat. She didn't preserve herself.

He knew he needed something of both Preservation and of Ruin. Something that\ncould both protect and destroy. Something that could destroy to protect.\nHe gave up his power at the Well, and into the mists, giving it to us so that we could take it. He\nalways intended this to happen.

Most of the men who had been watching with Sazed had fled. Even most of the\nsoldiers had retreated into the caverns, calling him a fool for waiting. Only General Demoux, who had\nmanaged to crawl back to the cavern after his atium ran out, remained, just a few steps into the tunnel.\nThe man was bloody, his arm ending in a tourniquet, his leg crushed. He coughed quietly, waiting for\nAslydin to return with more bandages.\nOutside, the sun rose into the sky. The heat was incredible, like an oven. Cries of pain echoed from\ndeep within the cavern behind Sazed. Koloss were inside.\n\"She'll come,\" Sazed whispered.\nHe could see Elend's body. It had fallen back down the pile of koloss corpses. It was stark, bright\nwhite and red against the black and blue of the koloss and ash.\n\"Vin will come,\" Sazed said insistently.\nDemoux looked dazed. Too much blood lost. He slumped back, closing his eyes. Koloss began to\nmove toward the cavern mouth, though they didn't have the direction or frenzy they'd displayed before.\n\"The Hero will come!\" Sazed said.\nOutside, something appeared, as if from mists, then slumped down in the bodies beside Elend's\ncorpse. It was followed immediately by something else, a second figure, which also fell motionless.\nThere! Sazed thought, scrambling out of the cavern. He dashed past several koloss. They tried to\nswing for him, but Sazed wore his metalminds. He felt he should have his copperminds to use in case he\nneeded to record something important.

Beside her, atop\nthe pile of dead koloss, lay another body. It was that of a man with red hair, one whom Sazed did not\nrecognize, but he ignored it.\nFor Vin was not moving.\nNo! he thought, checking for a pulse. There was none. Her eyes were closed. She looked peaceful,\nbut very, very dead.\n\"This can not be!\" he yelled, shaking her body again. Several koloss lumbered toward him.\nHe glanced upward. The sun was rising. It was getting hard to breathe for the heat. He felt his skin\nburning. By the time the sun reached its zenith, it would likely be so hot the land would burn.\n\"Is this how it ends?\" he screamed toward the sky. \"Your Hero is dead! Ruin's power may be broken,\nthe koloss may be lost to him as an army, but the world will still die!\"\nThe ash had killed the plants. The sun would burn away anything that remained. There was no food.\nSazed blinked out tears, but they dried on his face.\n\"This is how you leave us?\" he whispered.\nAnd then, he felt something. He looked down. Vin's body was smoking slightly. Not from the heat. It\nseemed to be leaking something . . . or, no. It was connected to something. The twists of mist he saw,\nthey led to a vast white light. He could just barely see it.\nHe reached out and touched the mist, and felt an awesome power. A power of stability. To the side,\nthe other corpse—the one he didn't recognize—was also leaking something. A deep black smoke. Sazed\nreached out with his other hand, touching the smoke, and felt a different power—more violent. The\npower of change.\nHe knelt, stunned, between the bodies. And, only then, did it start to make sense.\nThe prophecies always used the gender-neutral, he thought. So that they could refer to either a\nman or a woman, we assumed. Or . . . perhaps because they referred to a Hero who wasn't really\neither one?\nHe stood up. The sun's power overhead felt insignificant compared to the twin—yet\nopposite—powers that surrounded him.\nThe Hero would be rejected of his people, Sazed thought. Yet, he would save them. Not a\nwarrior, though he would fight. Not born a king, but would become one anyway.\nHe looked upward again.\nIs this what you planned all along?\nHe tasted of the power, but drew back, daunted. How could he use such a thing? He was just a man.\nIn the brief glimpse of forces that he touched, he knew that he'd have no hope of using it. He didn't have\nthe training.\n\"I can't do this,\" he said through cracked lips, reaching to the sky. \"I don't know how. I cannot make\nthe world as it was—I never saw it. If I take this power, I will do as the Lord Ruler did, and will only\nmake things worse for my trying. I am simply a man.\"\nKoloss cried out in pain from the burning.

His touch on the twin powers kept him alive, he knew, but he did not embrace\nthem.\n\"I am no Hero,\" he whispered, still reaching to the sky.\nHis arms twinkled, golden. His copperminds, worn on his forearms, reflected the light of the sun. They\nhad been with him for so long, his companions. His knowledge.\nKnowledge. . . .\nThe words of the prophecy were very precise, he thought suddenly. They say . . . they say that the\nHero will bear the future of the world on his arms.\nNot on his shoulders. Not in his hands. On his arms.\nBy the Forgotten Gods!\nHe slammed his arms into the twin mists and seized the powers offered to him. He drew them in,\nfeeling them infuse his body, making him burn. His flesh and bones evaporated, but as they did, he\ntapped his copperminds, dumping their entire contents into his expanding consciousness.\nThe copperminds, now empty, dropped with his rings to the pile of blue corpses beside the bodies of\nVin, Elend, and Ruin's nameless body. Sazed opened eyes as large as the world itself, drawing in power\nthat latticed all of creation.\nThe Hero will have the power to save the world. But he will also have the power to destroy it.\nWe never understood. He wouldn't simply bear the power of Preservation. He needed the power\nof Ruin as well.\nThe powers were opposites. As he drew them in, they threatened to annihilate each other. And yet,\nbecause he was of one mind on how to use them, he could keep them separate. They could touch\nwithout destroying each other, if he willed it. For these two powers had been used to create all things. If\nthey fought, they destroyed. If they were used together, they created.\nUnderstanding swelled within him. Over a thousand years, the Keepers had collected the knowledge\nof mankind and stored it in their copperminds. They had passed it down from Keeper to Keeper, each\nman or woman carrying the entire bulk of knowledge, so that he or she could pass it on when necessary.\nSazed had it all.\nAnd, in a moment of transcendence, he understood it all. He saw the patterns, the clues, the secrets.\nMen had believed and worshipped for as long as they had existed, and within those beliefs, Sazed found\nthe answers he needed. Gems, hidden from Ruin in all the religions of mankind.\nThere had been a people called the Bennett. They had considered mapmaking to be a solemn duty;\nSazed had once preached their religion to Kelsier himself. From their detailed maps and charts, Sazed\ndiscovered how the world had once looked. He used his powers to restore the continents and oceans,\nthe islands and coastlines, the mountains and rivers.\nThere had been a people known as the Nelazan.

        "text": "Thousand Eyes of their god, Trell, watching them. Sazed remembered well offering the religion to the\nyoung Vin while she had sat, captive, undergoing her first haircut with the crew. From the Nelazan, the\nKeepers had recovered star charts, and had dutifully recorded them—even though scholars had called\nthem useless, since they hadn't been accurate since the days before the Ascension. Yet, from these star\ncharts, and from the patterns and movements of the other planets in the solar system they outlined, Sazed\ncould determine exactly where the world was supposed to sit in orbit. He put the planet back into its old\nplace—not pushing too hard, as the Lord Ruler once had, for he had a frame of reference by which to\nmeasure.\nThere had been a people known as the Canzi who had worshipped death; they had provided detailed\nnotes about the human body. Sazed had offered one of their prayers over the bodies they had found in\nVin's old crew hideout, back when Kelsier had still lived. From the Canzi teachings about the body,\nSazed determined that the physiology of mankind had changed—either by the Lord Ruler's intention or\nby simple evolution—to adapt to breathing ash and eating brown plants. In a wave of power, Sazed\nrestored the bodies of men to the way they had been before, leaving each person the same, yet fixing the\nproblems that living for a thousand years on a dying world had caused. He didn't destroy men, warping\nand twisting them as the Lord Ruler had when he'd created the kandra, for Sazed had a guide by which\nto work.\nHe learned other things too. Dozens of secrets. One religion worshipped animals, and from it Sazed\ndrew forth pictures, explanations, and references regarding the life that should have lived on the earth.\nHe restored it. From another—Dadradah, the religion he had preached to Clubs before the man\ndied—Sazed learned about colors and hues. It was the last religion Sazed had ever taught, and with its\npoems about color and nature, he could restore the plants, sky, and landscape to the way they had once\nbeen. Every religion had clues in it, for the faiths of men contained the hopes, loves, wishes, and lives of\nthe people who had believed them.\nFinally, Sazed took the religion of the Larsta, the religion that Kelsier's wife—Mare—had believed in.\nIts priests had composed poetry during their times of meditation. From these poems—and from a scrap\nof paper that Mare had given to Kelsier, who had given it to Vin, who had given it to Sazed—he learned\nof the beautiful things that the world had once held.\nAnd he restored flowers to the plants that had once borne them.\nThe religions in my portfolio weren't useless after all, he thought, the power flowing from him and\nremaking the world. None of them were. They weren't all true.\nBut they all had truth.\nSazed hovered over the world, changing things as he felt he must. He cradled the hiding places of\nmankind, keeping the caverns safe—even if he did move them about—as he reworked the world's\ntectonics. Finally, he exhaled softly, his work finished. And yet, the power did not evaporate from him, as\nhe had expected it to."

And yet, the power did not evaporate from him, as\nhe had expected it to.\nRashek and Vin only touched small pieces of it at the Well of Ascension, he realized. I have\nsomething more. Something endless.\nRuin and Preservation were dead, and their powers had been joined together. In fact, they belonged\ntogether. How had they been split? Someday, perhaps, he would discover the answer to that question.\nSomebody would need to watch over the world, care for it, now that its gods were gone. It wasn't\nuntil that moment that Sazed understood the term Hero of Ages. Not a Hero that came once in the ages.\nBut a Hero who would span the ages. A Hero who would preserve mankind throughout all its lives\nand times. Neither Preservation nor Ruin, but both.\nGod.\nVin was special.\nPreservation chose her from a very young age, as I have mentioned. I believe that he was\ngrooming her to take his power. Yet, the mind of Preservation was very weak at that point,\nreduced only to the fragment that we knew as the mist spirit.\nWhat made him choose this girl? Was it because she was a Mistborn? Was it because she had\nSnapped so early in life, coming to her powers even as she went through the pains of the unusually\ndifficult labor her mother went through to bear her?\nVin was unusually talented and strong with Allomancy, even from the beginning. I believe that\nshe must have drawn some of the mist into her when she was still a child, in those brief times\nwhen she wasn't wearing the earring. Preservation had mostly gotten her to stop wearing it by the\ntime Kelsier recruited her, though she put it back in for a moment before joining the crew. Then,\nshe'd left it there at his suggestion.\nNobody else could draw upon the mists. I have determined this. Why were they open to Vin and\nnot others? I suspect that she couldn't have taken them all in until after she'd touched the power\nat the Well of Ascension. It was always meant, I believe, to be something of an attuning force.\nSomething that, once touched, would adjust a person's body to be able to accept the mists.\nYet, she did make use of a small crumb of Preservation's power when she defeated the Lord\nRuler, a year before she even began hearing the thumping of the power's return to the Well.\nThere is much more to this mystery. Perhaps I will tease it out eventually, as my mind grows\nmore and more accustomed to its expanded nature. Perhaps I will determine why I was able to\ntake the powers myself. For now, I only wish to make a simple acknowledgment of the woman\nwho held the power just before me.\nOf all of us who touched it, I feel she was the most worthy.\nEPILOGUE\nSPOOK AWOKE FROM THE NIGHTMARE, then sat up.

They made their way to the front of the cavern. Breeze sat\nat a table—of course, he would have furniture, while pretty much everyone else sat on the rock floor.\nSpook smiled at him, and the Soother raised an eyebrow.\n\"You're looking well, my boy,\" Breeze said, taking a drink of his wine.\n\"You could say that,\" Spook said.\n\"That's all you're going to say?\" Beldre said to Breeze. \"Look at him! He's been healed!\"\nBreeze shrugged, putting down his wine and standing. \"My dear, with all the oddities that have been\nhappening lately, young Spook's appearance doesn't measure up. A simple healing? Why, that's rather\nmundane, if you ask me.\"\nBreeze smiled, catching Spook's eye.\n\"Shall we then?\" Spook asked.\nBreeze shrugged. \"Why not? What do you think that we'll find?\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" Spook admitted, stepping into the antechamber beyond the cavern. He started to climb\nthe ladder.\n\"Spook,\" Beldre said warily. \"You know what the scouts said. The entire city was burning from the\nheat of the sun. . . .\"\nSpook looked up, noting the light shining between the cracks of the trapdoor. He smiled, then pushed\nit open.\nThere was no city outside. Just a field of grass. Green grass. Spook blinked at the strange sight, then\ncrawled out onto the soft earth, making room for Breeze. The Soother's head popped out, then cocked\nto the side. \"Now, there's a sight,\" he said, crawling out beside Spook.\nSpook stood up in the grass. It came up to his thighs. Green. Such a strange color for plants.\n\"And . . . the sky,\" Breeze said, shading his eyes. \"Blue. Not a hint of ash or smoke. Very odd. Very\nodd indeed. I'll bet Vin had something to do with this mess. That girl never could do things the proper\nway.\"\nSpook heard a gasp from behind, and turned to see Beldre climbing out of the cavern. He helped her\nstep up onto the ground, then they walked in silent wonder through the tall grass. The sun was so bright\noverhead, yet it wasn't uncomfortably hot.\n\"What happened to the city?\" Beldre whispered, holding Spook's arm.\nHe shook his head. Then, however, he heard something. He turned, thinking he saw motion on the\nhorizon. He walked forward, Beldre at his side, Breeze calling down for Allrianne to come up and see\nwhat had happened.\n\"Are those . . . people?\" Beldre asked, finally seeing what Spook had. The people in the distance saw\nthem, too, and as soon as they drew close, Spook smiled and waved at one.\n\"Spook?\" Ham called. \"Kid, is that you?\""

Ham stood with others, and behind them Spook could see\nanother trapdoor in the middle of the grassy meadow floor. People he didn't recognize—some wearing\nuniforms from Elend's army—were climbing out. Ham rushed over, wearing his usual vest and trousers,\nand grabbed Spook in an embrace.\n\"What are you doing here?\" Ham asked, letting go.\n\"I don't know,\" Spook said. \"Last I knew, I was in Urteau.\"\nHam looked up at the sky. \"I was in Fadrex! What happened?\"\nSpook shook his head. \"I don't know if the places we used to know have meaning anymore, Ham. . .\n.\"\nHam nodded, turning as one of the soldiers pointed. Another batch of people was emerging from a\nhole a short distance away. Spook and Ham walked forward—at least, until Ham saw someone in the\nother batch of people. Spook vaguely recognized her as Ham's wife, who had been back in Luthadel.\nThe Thug let out a cry of excitement, then rushed forward to greet his family.\nSpook made his way from hole to hole. There appeared to be six of them, some well populated,\nothers not so much. One stood out. It wasn't a trapdoor, like the others, but a slanted cave entrance.\nHere, he found General Demoux speaking with a small group of people, a pretty Terriswoman holding his\narm.\n\"I was in and out of consciousness for it,\" Demoux was saying, \"but I saw him. The Survivor. It had to\nbe him—hanging in the sky, glowing. Waves of color moved through the air, and the ground trembled,\nthe land spinning and moving. He came. Just like Sazed said he would.\"\n\"Sazed?\" Spook spoke up, Demoux noticing him for the first time. \"Where is he?\"\nDemoux shook his head. \"I don't know, Lord Spook.\" Then he paused. \"Where did you come from,\nanyway?\"\nSpook ignored the question. The openings and holes formed a pattern. Spook walked through the\nthick grass, leading Beldre, making his way to the very center of the pattern. The wind blew softly,\nbending the stalks of grass in wave-like undulations. Ham and Breeze rushed to catch up to him, already\narguing about something trivial, Ham with a child on one arm, his other around his wife's shoulders.\nSpook froze as he caught sight of a bit of color in the grass. He held up a hand, warning the others,\nand they stepped forward more quietly. There, in the center of the grass, was a field of . . . somethings.\nColorful somethings, growing from the ground, with tops like bright-colored leaves. They were shaped\nlike upside-down bells, with long straight stalks, the petals at the top open toward the sun. As if reaching\nfor its light and gaping to drink it in.\n\"Beautiful . . .\" Beldre whispered.\nSpook stepped forward, moving among the plants. Flowers, he thought, recognizing them from the\npicture Vin had carried. Kelsier's dream finally came true."

Kelsier's dream finally came true.\nAt the center of the flowers, he found two people. Vin lay wearing her customary mistcloak, shirt, and\ntrousers. Elend was in a brilliant white uniform, complete with cape. They were holding hands as they lay\namid the flowers.\nAnd they were both dead.\nSpook knelt beside them, listening to Ham and Breeze cry out. They examined the bodies, checking\nfor vital signs, but Spook focused on something else, almost hidden in the grass. He picked it up—a large\nleather tome.\nHe opened it, reading the first page.\nI am, unfortunately, the Hero of Ages, read the delicate, careful letters. Spook thought he\nrecognized the handwriting. As he flipped through the book, a slip of paper fell free. Spook picked it\nup—one side had a faded drawing of a flower, the very picture he'd been thinking about moments\nbefore. On the other side was a note scrawled in the same handwriting as the book.\nSpook, it read. I tried to bring them back, but apparently fixing the bodies doesn't return the\nsouls. I will get better at this with time, I expect. However, be assured that I have spoken with our\nfriends, and they are quite happy where they are. They deserve a rest, I think.\nThe book contains a short record of the events that led up to the world dying and being reborn,\nalong with some musings I have made about the history, philosophy, and science of recent\noccurrences. If you look to your right, you will find a much larger group of books in the grass.\nThese contain all of the knowledge—repeated verbatim—that was contained in my metalminds.\nLet the knowledge of the past not be forgotten.\nRebuilding will be difficult, I think—but likely far easier than living beneath the Lord Ruler or\nsurviving Ruin's attempt to destroy the world. I think you'll be surprised at the number of people\nwho fled to the storage caverns. Rashek planned very well for this day. He suffered much beneath\nRuin's hand, but he was a good man, who ultimately had honorable intentions.\nYou did well. Know that the message you sent via Captain Goradel saved us all, in the end. The\npeople will need leadership in the years to come. Likely, they will look to you. I'm sorry that I\ncannot be there in person to help you, but know that I am . . . about.\nI have made you Mistborn, and healed the damage you did to your body by flaring tin so much.\nI hope you don't mind. It was Kelsier's request, actually. Consider it a parting gift from him.\nWatch over them for me.\nP.S. There are still two metals that nobody knows about. You might want to poke about and see\nif you can figure out what they are. I think they'll interest you.\nSpook looked up, staring at the strangely empty, blue sky.

Vin\nfound his journal in the Lord Ruler's palace, and thought—at first—that he had become the Lord Ruler. It\nwas later discovered that his servant, Rashek, killed Alendi and took his place. Alendi was a friend and\nprotégé of Kwaan, a Terris scholar who thought that Alendi might be the Hero of Ages.\nALLOMANCY: A mystical hereditary power allowing the burning of metals inside the body to gain special\nabilities.\nALLOMANTIC METALS: There are eight basic Allomantic metals. These come in pairs, comprising a base\nmetal and its alloy. They can also be divided into two groups of four as internal metals (tin, pewter,\ncopper, bronze) and external metals (iron, steel, zinc, brass). It was long assumed that there were only\nten Allomantic metals: the eight basic metals, along with gold and atium. However, the discovery of active\nalloys for gold and atium expanded the number of metals to twelve. The discovery of aluminum and\nduralumin brought this number to fourteen.\nALLOMANTIC PULSE: The signal given off by an Allomancer who is burning metals.

It is also sometimes used\nin connection with Vin, as she did something similar in taking the power, though she released it instead of\nusing it.\nASCENSION, WELL OF: Historically the location of a great power, the Well of Ascension was the place to\nwhich it was prophecied the Hero of Ages would travel in order to gain the power he needed to defeat\nthe Deepness. Vin located it beneath Kredik Shaw in Luthadel (though it had always been thought to be\nin the Terris Mountains). It was deep within a large cavern filled with supplies and foodstuffs.

It was foretold that he would come,\ntake the power at the Well of Ascension, then be selfless enough to give it up in order to save the world\nfrom the Deepness. Alendi was thought to be the Hero of Ages, but was killed before he could complete\nhis quest. Vin followed in his footsteps, and got further, taking the power, then giving it up.

Elend executed Jastes for\nthe death and destruction he caused.\nKANDRA: A race of creatures who can ingest a person's dead body, then reproduce that body with their\nown flesh.

He ruled for a thousand\nyears, stamping out all remnants of the individual kingdoms, cultures, religions, and languages that used to\nexist in his land. In their place he set up his own system. Certain peoples were dubbed \"skaa,\" a word\nthat meant something akin to slave or peasant. Other peoples were dubbed nobility, and most of these\nwere descendants of those who had supported the Lord Ruler during his years of conquest. The Lord\nRuler had supposedly given them the power of Allomancy in order to gain powerful assassins and\nwarriors with intelligence, as opposed to the brutish koloss, and had used them well in conquering and\nmaintaining his empire.\nSkaa and nobility were forbidden to interbreed. During the thousand years of the Lord Ruler's reign,\nmany rebellions occurred among the skaa, but none were successful.\nFinally, a half-breed Mistborn known as Kelsier decided to challenge the Lord Ruler.

He gained\nthe powers of a Mistborn during that time, and managed to free himself, earning the title \"the Survivor of\nHathsin.\" At this point, he turned from his selfish ways and decided to try his most daring plan yet: the\noverthrow of the Final Empire.\nHe recruited a team of thieves, mostly half-breed Mistings, to help him achieve his goal. During this\ntime, he also discovered a young half-breed Mistborn girl named Vin. Vin was as yet unaware of her\npowers, and Kelsier brought her into the crew to train her, theoretically to have someone to whom he\ncould pass his legacy.\nKelsier's crew slowly gathered an underground army of skaa rebels. Despite their progress, the crew\nbegan to wonder if Kelsier was setting himself up to be another Lord Ruler. He sought to make himself a\nlegend among the skaa, becoming almost a religious figure to them. At the same time, Vin—who had\nbeen raised on the streets by a cruel brother—grew to trust people for the first time in her life. As this\nhappened, Vin began to believe in Kelsier and his purpose.\nEven before mastering her Allomantic talents, Vin was used as a spy among the nobility, and was\ntrained to infiltrate their balls and parties playing the part of \"Valette Renoux,\" a young noblewoman from\nthe countryside. During the first of these balls, she met Elend Venture, a young, idealistic nobleman and\nheir of his house. He eventually convinced her that not all noblemen were deserving of their poor\nreputation, and the two fell in love, despite Kelsier's best efforts.\nThe crew also discovered a journal, apparently written by the Lord Ruler himself during the days\nbefore the Ascension. This book painted a different picture of the tyrant—it depicted a melancholy, tired\nman who was trying his best to protect the people against the Deepness, despite the fact that he didn't\nreally understand it.\nIn the end, it was revealed that Kelsier's plan had been much broader than simply using a skaa army to\noverthrow the empire. In part the effort to raise troops provided an opportunity to spread rumors about\nhimself. He also used it to train his crew in the arts of leadership and persuasion. The true extent of his\nplan was revealed when he sacrificed his life in a very visible way, making himself a martyr to the skaa\nand finally convincing them to rise up and overthrow the Lord Ruler.\nOne of Kelsier's crewmembers—a man who had been playing the part of \"Lord Renoux,\" Valette's\nuncle—turned out to be a kandra named OreSeur. OreSeur took on Kelsier's form, then went about\ncreating rumors that Kelsier had returned from the grave, further inspiring the skaa. After this, OreSeur's\nContract passed to Vin.\nIt was Vin who actually killed the Lord Ruler. She discovered that he wasn't actually a god, or even\nimmortal—he had simply found a way to extend his life and his power by using Allomancy and\nFeruchemy at the same time.

His rule became unstable as various members\nof the Assembly began to jockey for power.\nRumors of the Lord Ruler's atium cache—combined with the prize that was Luthadel, the largest city\nin the empire—eventually drew several predators to the Central Dominance. The worst of these was\nStraff Venture, Elend's own father. Straff marched a sizable army to Luthadel, secretly bringing with him\na Mistborn son, named Zane. Fortunately for Luthadel, Breeze managed to convince a second\narmy—led by Ashweather Cett—to march on the city as well. Surprised by the presence of the other,\neach tyrant realized that he couldn't afford to attack the city, for afterward he would be vulnerable to the\nother army. So, they settled down into a siege, more worried about each other than they were about\nElend.\nAbout this time, a Keeper named Tindwyl arrived in Luthadel. Sazed invited her to come and help\nElend learn to be a better king. She worked with him, trying to teach him to temper his idealism with a\nmeasure of realism. Elend convinced the crew to help him play Straff and Cett against each other, with\nthe ultimate goal of getting them to fight. Elend hoped that if the two invaders weakened their armies\nagainst one another, his own force—by far the smallest of the three—could defeat the remnants. He\nbegan to meet with Straff and Cett, trying to manipulate them. During his maneuvering, however, a faction\nin the Assembly managed to depose him via a law he himself had written.\nElend refused to use his army to seize back the city, a decision that Tindwyl and the crew thought was\nfoolishly idealistic. Instead, he decided to play the political game and try to convince the Assembly to\nreinstate him.\nDuring all of this, Vin had troubles of her own. She had discovered a mysterious \"mist spirit\" that came\nout at nights, watching her. She noticed that the logbook author—Alendi—had seen a similar\nmanifestation before he arrived at the Well of Ascension. In addition, Vin began to hear strange\nthumpings when she burned bronze.\nVin's emotions regarding Elend and her own worth to him went through a great deal of turmoil. She\nloved him, but didn't think that the two of them were right for each other. She worried that she was too"

She worried that she was too\nbrutal, and not enough of a politician, to make him a good wife. Complicating this was Zane, Straff's\nMistborn son and Elend's half-brother, who spent many evenings sparring with Vin, tempting her and\ndriving a wedge between her and Elend. Vin began to rely upon the kandra OreSeur, who was—by\nElend's order—to remain by her side at all times and watch over her. The two became friends despite\ntheir initial dislike for one another.\nAbout this time, Sazed returned to Luthadel, having discovered some very alarming facts during his\nwanderings. First, it appeared that the mists were beginning to come during the day. Second, the mists\nwere somehow causing people to fall sick and die. Third, there was a large army of koloss marching on\nLuthadel, led by Jastes Lekal. Sazed began to work on researching these things, along with translating a\nstrange inscription he had discovered in the South while traveling with Marsh. This inscription turned out\nto record the last words of Kwaan, a scholar who—some thousand years earlier—had been deeply\ninvolved with Alendi, Rashek, and the Terris prophecies. Sazed also began to interact with Tindwyl, who\ndisapproved of his rebellious nature, yet harbored some deep feelings for him.\nElend's campaign in the Assembly failed, and they elected Ferson Penrod as their king instead of\nElend. Oddly, however, being deposed finally made Elend begin to understand what it meant to be a king\nand leader. He began to intertwine his philosophies about justice with the things Tindwyl was teaching\nhim, and actually started to become an inspiring and effective leader—even if he no longer held the\nthrone. The city's problems, however, grew even worse as Jastes Lekal's koloss arrived. It quickly\nbecame clear that he had only marginal control over the murderous beasts.\nEventually, Zane prompted Vin to assault Cett's base inside of Luthadel. (Cett had entered to make a\nplay for the throne himself.) She and Zane slaughtered their way to the top floor of the keep, where Vin\nhad a breakdown prompted by what she'd just done. She fled, leaving Cett alive. Soon after, Zane\nattacked her, driven to madness by strange voices in his head. Vin and Zane fought, and OreSeur\nrevealed himself as a spy, another kandra named TenSoon, who had killed and impersonated the real\nOreSeur. Vin managed to kill Zane, even though he had atium, then she ran to Elend. Her emotional\nproblems in remission, she convinced Sazed to marry Elend and her.\nFollowing his near-assassination, Cett retreated from Luthadel and withdrew his armies from the siege.\nElend's attempts to get Jastes to withdraw were unsuccessful. Outside, Straff realized that if he simply\npulled back, the koloss would probably attack and destroy the city—leaving Straff himself to return and\ntake control once the beasts had exhausted themselves in combat."

Sazed convinced them that they\nshould lie to Vin and Elend, telling them that the city would be safe and sending them north to search for\nthe Well of Ascension. This ploy succeeded. Vin and Elend left, taking Spook with them, and in their\nabsence the koloss finally attacked. The city's army fought well, Sazed himself holding one of the city\ngates against terrible odds. During the fighting, Clubs, Dockson, and Tindwyl were killed. As the koloss\nwere about to destroy everything, Vin returned to the city, having learned from Spook that she had been\ndeceived.\nVin exploited an Allomantic weakness in the koloss revealed to her by TenSoon/OreSeur the kandra,\ntaking control of the koloss in the same way the Lord Ruler once had. She used those koloss to attack\nStraff's army when it returned, and she was joined by Cett at the last moment. With Straff dead, Vin\nforced Penrod, Cett, and Straff's second-in-command to swear allegiance to Elend, naming him emperor.\nThe city was saved. However, Vin continued to hear the strange thumpings in her mind. She'd become\nconvinced that she—not the ancient man Alendi—was the Hero of Ages. She soon realized that the Well\nof Ascension wasn't actually in the northern mountains, but instead beneath Luthadel. She and Elend\ninvestigated this, discovering that beneath Kredik Shaw, there was a large secret cavern stockpiled with\nfood. Beyond that cavern was another, filled with dark smoke. Beyond that, a pool of glowing power.\nThe Well of Ascension.\nSazed, up above, was still reeling from Tindwyl's death. He had thrown himself into his studies, and\ndiscovered—to his alarm—that something was very wrong with the prophecies. He rushed after Vin and\nElend, intent on stopping them from taking the power at the Well, but was blocked by Marsh. As the two\nfought, Vin took the power and did what she thought was the right thing. Though the mist spirit stabbed\nElend, Vin didn't use the Well's power to heal him. Instead, she released it as the prophecies said she had\nto do in order to stop the mists from destroying the world.\nShe made the wrong choice. A dark force imprisoned near the Well of Ascension had altered the\nprophecies and led Vin to do what was necessary to release it. The thing burst free, leaving Vin with the\nhorror of what she had done. The mist spirit, however, provided a way for her to save Elend by making\nhim into a Mist-born.\nThe book ended with Vin and Elend on the walls of Luthadel, having saved the city but also having\nreleased a terrible force upon the world. Sazed, crushed by Tindwyl's death, had come to believe that his\nfaith was worthless. Spook was riddled with guilt for abandoning Clubs to die in the city, and both\nBreeze and Ham bore emotional scars from their seemingly hopeless fight against the koloss. On top of"

On top of\nall this, as Sazed had reported, the mists had changed somehow, and they now killed people who went\ninto them.\nElend, however, was determined to consolidate their new empire and find a way to fight the thing that\nVin had released. When she asked him what they were going to do now, he had only one answer for her:\nThey were going to survive. No matter what.\nOne year has passed."
