    "text": "now wheeled aimlessly overhead as Tamas inspected the ruin by the light of\nthe rising sun.\nThe destruction had been wrought by Privileged elemental sorcery.\nGranite keystones had been cut apart with an almost casual indifference,\nand entire sections of the cathedral were melted away with fire hotter than\nthe center of any forge. The sight turned Tamas’s stomach.\n“Looks worse from far off,” Olem said. He stood beside Tamas, hand\nresting on the butt of his pistol beneath his greatcoat, eyes scanning the\nstreets for signs of Brudanian patrols. He spoke around the cigarette\nclenched between his lips. “This must have been the column of smoke our\nscouts saw. The rest of the city seems intact.”\nTamas scowled at his bodyguard. “This cathedral was three hundred\nyears old. It took sixty years to build. I refuse to be relieved that the damned\nBrudanians invaded Adopest just to destroy the cathedral.”\n“They had the chance to level the whole city. They didn’t. I call that\nlucky, sir.”\nOlem was right, of course. They had ridden hard for two weeks,\ndangerously far ahead of the Seventh and Ninth brigades and their new\nDeliv allies, in order to determine the fate of the city. Tamas had been\nrelieved to see Adopest still standing.\nBut now it lay in the hands of a Brudanian army and Tamas was forced\nto sneak about in his own city. There were no words to describe the anger\nhe felt.\nHe pushed down that rage, trying to get control of himself. They’d\narrived on the outskirts of the city only a few hours ago, sneaking in under\ncover of darkness. He had to get organized, to find his allies, scout his\nenemies, and find out how an entire city could fall into Brudanian hands\nwith no sign of a fight. Pit, Brudania was eight hundred miles away!\nHad another one of his council betrayed him?\n“Sir,” Vlora said, drawing Tamas’s attention to the south. She stood\nabove them on the remains of a buttress, watching the Ad River and the old\nquarter of the city beyond it. Like Tamas and Olem, she wore a greatcoat to\nconceal her Adran uniform, and her dark hair was tucked beneath a tricorne\nhat. “A Brudanian patrol. There’s a Privileged with them.”\nTamas eyed the rubble and considered the lay of the street to their\nsouth, formulating a plan to ambush the Brudanian patrol. He forced\nhimself to stop that line of thought. He couldn’t risk any open conflict. Not\nwithout more men. He’d only brought Vlora and Olem ahead of the army\nand while they might be able to cut through a single Brudanian patrol, any\nkind of firefight would bring more running.\n“We need soldiers,” Tamas said.\nOlem ashed his cigarette on the ruins of the cathedral altar. “I can try\nto find Sergeant Oldrich. He’s got fifteen of my Riflejacks with him.”\n“That would be a start,” Tamas said.\n“I think we should make contact with Ricard,” Vlora said. “Find out\nwhat happened to the city. He’ll have men that we can use.”\nTamas acknowledged the advice with a nod. “In good time. Pit. I"

I want more men\nbefore we go see Ricard.” I don’t know if he’s turned on us. Tamas had left\nTaniel’s unconscious body in Ricard’s care. If someone had harmed his boy,\nTamas would…\nHe swallowed bile and tried to gain control of his pounding heart.\n“Sabon’s trainees?” Olem asked.\nBefore Sabon’s death he had been tasked with setting up a school for\npowder mages just north of the city. Early reports were that he had over\ntwenty men and women with some talent and that he was already teaching\nthem how to shoot and fight and control their powers.\nThey’d had only a few months of training. It would have to be good\nenough.\n“The trainees,” Tamas agreed. “At the very least we can get Telavere\nbefore we go to Ricard.”\nThey headed across the Ad River in the cool dawn as the streets began\nto fill with people. Tamas noted that Brudanian patrols, while they were\nfrequent and the street guards plentiful, seemed to leave the citizens\nunmolested. No one questioned him or his companions as they passed\nthrough the old city’s western gates or as they left the city once again to\nreach the suburban northland.\nTamas saw Brudanian ships in the harbor along the river and their tall\nmasts out in the bay to the south. The mountain-crossing canal that Ricard’s\nunion had been building must have been a success, he noted wryly. It was\nthe only way oceangoing vessels of that size could reach the Adsea.\nTamas lost track of the number of destroyed churches and monasteries.\nIt seemed as if every other city block had a pile of rubble where a church\nhad once been. He couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to the\npriests and priestesses that staffed them and why they in particular had been\ntargeted by the Brudanian Privileged.\nIt was something he’d have to ask Ricard.\nTheir journey took them an hour north of the city by foot, where the\nschool stood on the bank of the Ad River. It was an old brick building, a\ndecommissioned clothing factory with a field off to one side that had been\nturned into a firing range. As they came off the road, Vlora grasped Tamas’s\narm. He sensed panic in her touch.\nTamas felt his chest tighten.\nThe windows of the dormitory above the school were shuttered, and\nthe main door hung off its hinges. A wooden placard, emblazoned with the\nsilver powder keg of a powder mage, had been knocked from its place\nabove the door and lay broken in the mud. The grounds around the school\nand the firing range beside it were quiet and abandoned, the grass\novergrown.\n“Vlora,” Tamas said, “take the south side by the river. Olem, swing\naround to the north.”\nThe two moved off with a “yessir” and no further questions. Vlora\nremoved her hat and crept through the tall grass, while Olem continued up\nthe street past the school, sauntering casually, before cutting across the"

    "text": "removed her hat and crept through the tall grass, while Olem continued up\nthe street past the school, sauntering casually, before cutting across the\nfiring range to approach the school from uphill.\nTamas waited for them to be in position before he continued cautiously\ndown the path to the school. He opened his third eye to look into the Else,\nsearching for signs of sorcery, but it revealed nothing about the contents of\nthe building. If anyone lay waiting inside, they weren’t Privileged or\nKnacked.\nNor could he sense any powder mages, for that matter. Why was the\nschool empty? Telavere had been left in charge. She was a powder mage of\nlittle raw power but excellent technical skill, a perfect choice to teach the\nrecruits. Could she have taken them into hiding when the Brudanians\narrived? Had they been attacked?\nTamas drew his pistols as he neared the school, pausing only to\nsprinkle black powder on his tongue. A powder trance gripped his body, his\neyesight, hearing, and smell sharpening and the pain of the ride ebbing\naway behind a curtain of strength.\nA low sound filled his ears, almost drowned out by the sound of the\ngentle flow of the Ad River. He couldn’t quite place the sound, but he knew\nthe smell that filled his nostrils. It smelled of iron and decay. Blood.\nTamas checked the front window of the school. The glare of the\nmorning sun prevented him from piercing the darkness within. The low\nsound seemed a roar now in his trance-enhanced hearing, and the scent of\ndeath filled him with dread.\nHe kicked the front door off its hinges and dove in with both pistols\nready. He froze in the entryway, eyes adjusting to the dim light.\nHis caution was unwarranted. The foyer was empty, and the silence\nstretched throughout the building – but for the low drone of what he now\nsaw were thousands of flies. They buzzed and churned in the air, dancing\nagainst the windowpanes.\nTamas shoved both pistols into his belt so he could tie a handkerchief\nabout his mouth and nose. Despite the flies and the smell, there were no\nbodies in the entryway, and the only sign of violence was the smear of rust\non the floors and splatters on the wall. Men had been killed here, and the\nbodies dragged away.\nHe followed the trail of smeared blood from the entryway and\nproceeded deeper into the old factory building, one pistol held at the ready.\nThe factory floor, an immense room that had no doubt once been home\nto dozens of long tables where seamstresses worked at their sewing by the\nhundred, was empty now but for a dozen desks along one side. There were\nfewer flies here except for the ones hanging out around a half-dozen stains\nand rusty puddles where men had died.\nThe smears continued along the factory floor and out through a door in\nthe back corner.\nTamas whirled at a sound, leveling his pistol, but it was only Vlora\ncoming down the stairway from the dormitory above. He noted plenty of\nblood on the stairs as well.\n“What did you find?” Tamas asked. His voice echoed eerily in the\nlarge room.\n“Flies.” Vlora spit on the floor. “Flies, and half the back wall of the"

    "text": "“What did you find?” Tamas asked. His voice echoed eerily in the\nlarge room.\n“Flies.” Vlora spit on the floor. “Flies, and half the back wall of the\nschool is missing. Plenty of scorch marks. Someone detonated at least two\nhorns of powder up there.” She swore under her breath, the only crack in\nher professional demeanor.\n“What happened here?” Tamas asked.\n“I don’t know, sir.”\n“No bodies?”\n“None.”\nTamas gritted his teeth in frustration. Plenty of blood – that’s what the\nflies were attracted to – and more than a little gore. Dozens of men had died\nin this building and not all that long ago.\n“They dragged the bodies out the back,” Olem said, his voice echoing\nin the large room as he stepped through a small doorway at the far corner of\nthe room.\nWhen Tamas and Vlora had joined him, Olem pointed at the floor\nwhere the lines of rust overlapped each other all the way out the back,\ndisappearing into the tall grass between the school and the Ad River.\n“Whoever did this,” Olem said, “cleaned up after themselves. They didn’t\nwant any bodies to tell a story.”\n“The story tells itself,” Tamas snapped, striding back inside. He went\nto the front of the school, scattering flies in his wake. “They came in\nthrough the front.” He pointed to blood spatter and bullet holes in the wall.\n“Overran whoever was standing guard, then took the factory floor. Our\nmages made a last stand upstairs, using whatever powder was at their\ndisposal…”\nHe heard his voice crack. These men and women were his\nresponsibility. They were his newest mages. Some were farmers, two of\nthem bakers. One had been a librarian. They weren’t trained for combat.\nThey’d been slaughtered like sheep.\nHe could only pray that they had been able to take a few of the enemy\nwith them.\n“Death is a bloody painter and this is his canvas,” Olem said quietly.\nHe lit a cigarette and drew in a deep breath, then blew smoke against the\nwall, watching the flies scatter.\n“Sir,” Vlora said, stepping past Tamas and snatching something off the\nground. She handed Tamas a round bit of leather with a hole in the middle.\n“Looks like it was behind the door. Whoever cleaned this place up must\nhave missed it. Do you know what it is?”\nTamas spit to get rid of the sudden bitter taste in his mouth. “It’s a\nleather gasket. You have to keep spares if you carry an air rifle. It must have\nfallen out of someone’s kit.”\nAn air rifle. A weapon used specifically to kill powder mages.\nWhoever had done this had come prepared.\nTamas threw the gasket away and stuffed his pistol into his belt.\n“Olem, who all knew the location of this school?”\n“Aside from the powder cabal?” Olem rolled his cigarette between his\nfingers, considering. “It wasn’t a closely guarded secret. They put up a sign,\nafter all.”\n“Who all knew directly?” Tamas said.\n“A couple members of the General Staff and Ricard Tumblar.”\nThe General Staff were men and women who had been with him for"

    "text": "after all.”\n“Who all knew directly?” Tamas said.\n“A couple members of the General Staff and Ricard Tumblar.”\nThe General Staff were men and women who had been with him for\ndecades. Tamas trusted them. He had to trust them.\n“I want answers, even if someone has to bleed to give them. Find me\nRicard Tumblar.”\nCHAPTER 2\nT\nhe Holy Warriors of Labor, the biggest workers’ union in all the Nine,\nkept their headquarters inside an old warehouse in the Factory District of\nAdopest not far from where the Ad River spilled out into the Adsea.\nTamas watched the building with some trepidation. There were\nhundreds of people coming and going. It would be almost impossible to get\nin to speak with Ricard without being seen – and probably recognized – by\nsomeone. The coming conversation could very well become bloody, and\nTamas didn’t want to have it where Ricard’s guards were within screaming\ndistance.\nIf not for the urgent pressure of his heart pounding in his chest, Tamas\nwould have waited until nightfall and followed Ricard home.\n“We could make an appointment, sir,” Olem suggested, leaning\ncasually against the stoop. Across the street, one of the union guards was\nwatching them with a frown. Olem waved to the man and held up a spare\ncigarette. The union guard cocked an eyebrow and then turned away, his\ninterest gone.\n“I’m not making an appointment,” Tamas said flatly. “I don’t want him\nto know we’re coming.”\n“I think he’s going to know one way or another. He’s got more than\ntwenty armed men on this street alone.”\n“I only counted eighteen.”\nOlem watched the foot traffic pass them with a feigned air of\nindifference. “Marksmen in the window above the shop thirty paces to your\nleft, sir.”\n“Ah.” Tamas saw them now out of the corner of his eye. “Something\nhas Ricard spooked. The old headquarters had no more than four guards at\nany time.”\n“Could be he’s worried about the Brudanians?”\n“Or that I’ll return. There’s Vlora. Let’s go.”\nThey worked their way down the street, doing their best to avoid the\nattention of the union guards, and joined Vlora in the doorway of a small\nbakery. Tamas looked over the loaves stacked on the counter and wondered\nwhere Mihali had ended up. Was he still down south, with the main army?\nOf course he was. If Mihali wasn’t holding Kresimir at bay, then\nAdopest would have been leveled by now. Tamas felt himself wishing for a\nbowl of the chef’s squash soup just about now.\nVlora led them through the bakery and out the back into a narrow alley\nfilled with refuse and mud. “Down here,” she said over her shoulder as they\npicked their way down the alley. Tamas’s boots squelched as he walked and\nhe tried to ignore the smell. The Factory District was by far the dirtiest part\nof the city – and the alleys were always the worst.\nThey navigated three more alleys, then climbed an iron ladder over a\ntwo-story building before they found the back entrance to the union\nheadquarters."

A brief glance\nat the mud told Tamas that a quick scuffle had taken place, but Vlora had\ntaken the two men without trouble.\n“Are they dead?” Olem asked, flicking his cigarette into the mud\nbefore drawing his pistol.\n“Unconscious.”\n“Good,” Tamas said. “Try not to kill anyone on the way in. We don’t\nknow for sure whether Ricard has betrayed us.” And if he has, I’ll do the\nkilling. Tamas set his hand to the door only to have Olem stop him.\n“Pardon sir, but we’ll go first.”\n“I can…”\n“It’s my job, sir. You haven’t been letting me do it lately.”\nTamas bit his tongue. This was a terrible time for insubordination from\nhis own bodyguard, but Olem had a point. “Go on.”\nHe didn’t have to wait for more than about three minutes before Olem\nreturned for him. “Sir. We have him.”\nThey passed through the back hallways and two servants’ rooms\nbefore slipping in the side entrance to Ricard’s office. Ricard himself sat\nbehind his desk, his jacket stained and his beard wild, his eyes narrowed in\nanger. Behind him, Vlora stood with the barrel of a pistol against the back\nof his head.\nWhen he saw Olem, Ricard slammed both hands on his desk. “What is\nthe meaning of this? What do you think…” His jaw dropped and he made to\nstand. Vlora put a hand on his shoulder to keep him in his seat. “Tamas?\nYou’re alive?”\n“You don’t sound too surprised,” Tamas said. He holstered his own\npistol and nodded to Vlora to let go of Ricard’s shoulder. Olem took up a\nposition beside the main office door.\nRicard swallowed hard, looking between Tamas and Olem. Tamas\ntried to decide if it was the nervousness of a man caught in betrayal or just\nthe shock of his sudden presence. “I had heard you were still alive, but none\nof my sources were reliable. I —”\n“What happened to my powder mage school? And where’s my boy?”\n“Taniel?”\n“Do I have another?”\n“Do you?”\n“No.”\n“I… well, I don’t know where Taniel is.”\n“You better explain quickly.” Tamas drummed his fingers on the ivory\nhandle of one of his dueling pistols.\n“Of course, of course! Can I offer you some wine?”\nTamas tilted his head slightly. Ricard seemed unaware that he was two\nwrong words away from a bullet cleaning out his skull. “Talk.”\n“It’s a very long story.”\n“Sum up.”\n“Taniel woke up. Not long after you went south, the savage girl\nbrought him back.

He was kicked out of the army and was hired by the Wings\nof Adom, but then killed five of General Ket’s soldiers in self-defense. He\nthen disappeared.”\nTamas rocked back on his heels, head spinning. “That’s all happened\nin the last three months?”\nRicard nodded, glancing over his shoulder at Vlora.\n“And you don’t know where he is now?”\n“No.”\n“And what happened to the school?”\nRicard frowned. “I haven’t heard from them for a few weeks. I\nassumed everything was fine.”\nTamas tried to read Ricard’s face. This was a man who had made his\nfortune by being likable – smoothing things over and getting people to work\ntogether. Despite this, he was a terrible liar. The fact that he didn’t seem to\nbe lying now only deepened Tamas’s concern.\nOlem’s startled shout was Tamas’s only warning. He whirled to see a\nwoman kick Olem in the side of the knee, sending him to the ground with a\ncurse. The woman leapt upon Tamas, a stiletto in one hand, moving with\nimpossible speed. Tamas caught her by the wrist and swung her past him –\nor at least he tried. She stepped back suddenly, flicked the stiletto into the\nair, and caught it with her other hand, stabbing it at Tamas’s throat.\nThe knife missed by mere inches as Vlora slammed into the woman\nfrom one side, and they both hit Ricard’s bookshelf with enough force to\nbring the whole thing down on them. Olem, back on his feet, waded into the\nmess to grab the woman by her collar, only to receive a punch to his groin.\nHe doubled over and fell back against the wall.\nTamas stepped up behind the woman, ready to shoot her to keep her\ndown.\n“Fell, stop!” Ricard bellowed.\nThe woman immediately stopped struggling.\nStill with a pistol trained on the woman, Tamas pulled Vlora and then\nOlem to their feet. The woman lifted herself to a sitting position in the\nmiddle of the collapsed bookshelf and stared sullenly at the pistol in\nTamas’s hand.\n“Damn it, Fell,” Ricard said. “What the pit was that?”\n“You were in danger, sir,” Fell said.\n“Were you trying to kill the field marshal?”\nFell’s cheeks grew slightly red. “I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t recognize him\nfrom behind. And no, I was only trying to incapacitate them.”\n“You swung a knife at my face!” Tamas said.\n“It wouldn’t have gone deep. I am very precise.”\nTamas glanced between Vlora and Olem. Vlora had a darkening bruise\non one cheek from the bookshelf and Olem cursed softly as he clutched at\nhis groin. This woman had faced three armed strangers without fear, and\nshe had only meant to incapacitate them? She had dropped Olem in a split\nsecond and nearly gotten the better of Tamas himself, even though he was\nburning a low powder trance.\n“You’ve been hiring better people, I see,” Tamas said to Ricard.\nRicard returned to his desk chair and put his head in his hands. “You"

He couldn’t,” Fell said from her spot on the floor. “He’s been\nout of contact for months. The city is in foreign hands. He wouldn’t know\nwhat to think.”\nRicard scowled at her for a moment, only for the scowl to slide away, a\nlook of realization replacing it. “Oh. You think I sold the city out to the\nBrudanians, don’t you?”\n“I know,” Tamas said, “that a foreign army holds my city and that I left\nyou, the Proprietor, and Ondraus with the keys to the city gates.”\n“It’s bloody Lord Claremonte.”\nIt was Tamas’s turn to scowl. “Lord Vetas’s master? Adamat didn’t\nroot out that mongrel?”\n“Adamat did an admirable job,” Ricard said. “Lord Vetas is dead and\nhis men dead or scattered. We broke him only for his master to arrive with\ntwo brigades of Brudanian soldiers and half the Brudanian Royal Cabal.”\n“No one defended the city?”\nRicard’s nostrils flared. “We tried. But… Claremonte didn’t come to\nconquer. Or so he says. He claims his army is only here to help defend us\nfrom the Kez. He’s running for the office of First Minister of Adro.”\n“Like pit he is.” Tamas began to pace. This army in control of Adopest\nposed too many questions. If Tamas was going to find out answers, he’d\nhave to do it backed by an army of his own. The Seventh and the Ninth,\nalong with his Deliv allies, were still weeks away.\n“Get me a meeting with Claremonte,” Tamas said.\n“That might not be the best idea.”\n“Why not?”\n“He has half the Brudanian Royal Cabal behind him!” Ricard said.\n“Can you think of any group that hates you more than the royal cabals of\nthe Nine? They’ll kill you outright and dump your body in the Ad.”\nTamas continued to pace. He didn’t have the time for this. So many\nenemies. So many facets to consider. He needed allies badly. “What news\nfrom the front?”\n“They’re still holding, but…”\n“But what?”\n“I haven’t had any good information from the front for almost a\nmonth.”\n“You haven’t heard from the General Staff for that long? Pit, the Kez\ncould be at the city gates by tomorrow! Damn it, I…”\n“Sir,” Fell said to Ricard. “Have you told him about Taniel?”\nTamas whirled on Ricard, snatching him by the front of the jacket.\n“What? What about him?”\n“There have been… I mean, I’ve heard rumors, but —”\n“What kind of rumors?”\n“Nothing substantial.”\n“Tell me.”\nRicard studied his hands before saying quietly, “That Taniel was\ncaptured by Kresimir and hung in the Kez camp. But,” he said more loudly,\n“they’re just rumors.”"

But,” he said more loudly,\n“they’re just rumors.”\nTamas could hear his heart thundering in his ears. The Kez had taken\nhis boy? They had hung him like a piece of meat, some macabre trophy?\nFear coursed through him, followed by the fire of white-hot fury. He found\nhimself sprinting from Ricard’s office, shoving his way through the crowd\nout into the building’s main hall.\nOlem and Vlora caught up with him in the street.\n“Where are we going, sir?” Vlora asked.\nTamas gripped the butt of his pistol. “I’m going to find my boy, and if\nhe’s not alive and well, I’m going to pull Kresimir’s guts out through his\nass.”\nCHAPTER 3\nA\ndamat was on his way to arrest a general.\nHe sat in the back of a carriage, the ground bumping away beneath\nhim, and stared out the window at the fields of southern Adro. The fields\nwere golden with fall wheat, the stalks bent by the weight of their fruit and\nswaying gently in the wind. The peacefulness of it all made him think of his\nfamily; both his wife and children at home and the one sold into slavery by\nthe enemy.\nThis might not go well.\nNo, Adamat corrected himself. This could not go well.\nWhat kind of a madman goes to arrest a general during wartime? The\ngovernment was in disarray – practically nonexistent – and it was a miracle\nthat the courts were still operating on a local level. All federal cases had\nbeen suspended since Manhouch’s execution, and it had taken bribery and\ncajoling to get Ricard Tumblar, one of the interim-council elders, to sign a\nwarrant for General Ket’s arrest. They’d strong-armed two local judges into\nsigning the same warrant. Adamat hoped it would be enough.\nThe driver of the carriage gave a terse command and the carriage\nsuddenly slowed to a stop, lurching Adamat forward in his seat. A glance\nout one window showed him the wheat fields and rolling hills that gradually\ngave way to the mountains of the Charwood Pile, their peaks far in the\ndistance, while the other window gave him an unobstructed view of the\nAdsea stretching off to the southeast.\n“Why have we stopped?”\nOne of Adamat’s traveling companions stirred from her slumber. Nila\nwas a woman of about nineteen with curly auburn hair and a face that could\ncharm its way into a king’s court. Adamat was under the impression that\nshe was a laundress. He still wasn’t quite sure why she had come along on\nthis journey, but Privileged Borbador had insisted.\nAdamat opened the door and called up to the driver. “What’s going\non?”\n“The sergeant ordered a stop.”\nHe ducked his head back inside. Why would Oldrich call for a stop?\nThey were too far north to have run into the Adran army already. They still\nhad over a day to travel before they reached the front.\nThe carriage lurched ahead again suddenly, only to pull off to one side"

They still\nhad over a day to travel before they reached the front.\nThe carriage lurched ahead again suddenly, only to pull off to one side\nof the road in order to let traffic continue past them. A stagecoach rumbled\non, and then a trio of wagons filled with supplies for the front.\n“Something is wrong,” Adamat said.\nNila rubbed the sleep from her eyes. “Bo,” she said, poking the man\nsleeping on her shoulder.\nPrivileged Borbador, only surviving member of King Manhouch’s\nroyal cabal, gave a start and then went back to snoring loudly.\n“Bo!” Nila slapped Bo’s cheek.\n“I’m here!” Bo sat upright, bare hands dancing in the air in front of\nhim. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes and slowly lowered his hands.\n“Bloody pit, girl,” he said. “If I had been wearing my gloves, I could have\nkilled both of you.”\n“Well, you weren’t,” Nila said. “We’ve stopped.”\nBo ran a hand through his ruddy hair and pulled on a pair of white\ngloves covered in archaic runes. “Why?”\n“Not sure,” Adamat said. “I’ll go check.” He hauled himself out of the\ncarriage, glad to be out of close confines with the Privileged. Bo’s\nelemental sorcery could kill Adamat, Oldrich, and the entire platoon of\nAdran soldiers that made up their escort in mere seconds. Adamat had\nwatched Bo snap the neck of Manhouch’s executioner with a flick of his\nwrist. For all of his charm, Bo was a cold-blooded killer. Adamat glanced\nback into the carriage once and then trudged up a slight incline toward\nwhere Sergeant Oldrich and several of his men conferred beside the road.\n“Inspector,” Oldrich said with a nod. “Where is the Privileged?”\n“Better start calling him ‘counselor,’” Adamat said.\nOldrich snorted. “All right. Where’s the lawyer? We’ve run into\nsomething unexpected.”\n“Oh?”\n“There’s an army just over that rise,” Oldrich said.\nAdamat felt his heart leap into his throat. An army? Had the Kez\nfinally broken through? Were they marching on Adopest?\n“An Adran army,” Oldrich added.\nAdamat’s relief was short-lived. “What are they doing here?” he asked.\n“They’re supposed to be in Surkov’s Alley still. Have they been pushed\nback this far?”\n“What’s going on?” Bo arrived, stretching his arms behind his back.\nAdamat was reminded again just how young Bo was – not far into his\ntwenties, at a guess. Certainly not yet thirty. Despite his youth, the\nPrivileged had worry lines on his brow and an old man’s eyes.\nAdamat looked pointedly at Bo’s gloves. “You’re supposed to be a\nlawyer,” Adamat said.\n“I don’t like going without my gloves,” Bo said, cracking his knuckles.\n“Besides, no one will see. The army is still a ways off.”\n“That’s not quite true,” Oldrich said, jerking his head toward the rise in\nthe road.\nNila had caught up to them. “With me,” Bo said to her. They headed"

They headed\nup to look at the army over the rise.\nOldrich watched them go. “I don’t trust them,” he said when they were\nout of earshot.\n“We have to,” Adamat said.\n“Why? Field Marshal Tamas has always got on without Privileged to\nhold his hand.”\n“Tamas is a powder mage,” Adamat said. “Neither you nor I have that\nbenefit. And Bo is our backup. If this doesn’t work – if General Ket won’t\ncome along quietly to face the law in Adopest – then we’ll need Bo to get\nus out of whatever mess we make.”\nOldrich rubbed his temples with both hands. “Pit. I can’t believe I let\nyou talk me into this.”\n“You want justice, don’t you? You want us to win this war?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then we need to arrest General Ket.”\nBo and Nila returned. Nila frowned to herself, while Bo seemed\nthoughtful.\n“What do you think is going on over there?” Bo asked Oldrich. “That\ncamp should be dozens of miles to our south.”\n“Could be anything,” Oldrich said. “Could be the wounded from the\nfront. Could be reinforcements. Could be that our boys were routed and\nthey’re retreating.”\nBo scratched his chin. He had removed his Privileged gloves. “It’s\nafternoon. If our boys were routed, then they’d be marching toward\nAdopest right now. I don’t know what it is, but something is wrong. There’s\nno more than six brigades in that camp. Too many for reinforcements, too\nfew to be the whole army.”\n“We should find out what’s going on,” Adamat said.\n“How?” Bo demanded. “We will only know what’s happening by\nriding into that camp. Which we have to do, by the way. If I want to save\nTaniel – pit, if he’s even still alive – and if you want my help saving your\nson, then we’re heading down there.”\nBo strode off toward the waiting carriage.\nNila remained, looking between Oldrich and Adamat.\n“If this thing goes bad,” Oldrich said to Nila, “will he back us up?”\nNila turned to watch Bo. “I think so.”\n“You ‘think’?”\nNila shrugged. “He might also burn his way through a few companies\nof soldiers and leave us in the wreckage.”\nOldrich asked, “What did you say you do?”\n“I’m Bo’s – the counselor’s – secretary,” Nila said.\n“And before that?”\n“I was a laundress.”\n“Ah.”\nThey returned to the carriage and were soon moving again, heading\nover the hill, where the sight took Adamat’s breath away. The Adran camp\nspread out across the plain in a sea of white tents. It seemed to move and\nwriggle, like an anthill viewed from above, thousands of soldiers and camp\nfollowers going about their day.\nThe carriage came to a stop once more a mile later as they reached the\ncamp’s pickets. Adamat heard one of the guards call out to Oldrich.\n“Reinforcements?” a woman’s voice asked."

Adamat heard one of the guards call out to Oldrich.\n“Reinforcements?” a woman’s voice asked.\n“Eh? No, escorting a lawyer down here on the orders of the interim\ncouncil.”\n“A lawyer? What for?”\n“No idea. I’m supposed to bring the lawyer down here and convene a\nmeeting of the General Staff.”\nBo had his head near the window, listening intently to the\nconversation. He had pulled his Privileged gloves back on, though he held\nthem below the window, and his fingers twitched ever so slightly.\n“Well,” the guard said, her voice bored, “that’s going to be harder than\nyou think.”\nOldrich groaned. “What’s happened this time?”\n“Uh, well…” The guard cleared her throat, and what she said next was\ntoo low for Adamat to hear. Across from him, Nila had a look of\nconcentration on her face.\nOldrich whistled in return. “Thanks for the warning.” A moment later\nand the carriage rumbled on. Adamat cursed under his breath.\n“What’s happening?” he asked Bo. “Did you hear that?”\nInstead of answering, Bo looked at Nila. “Did you listen like I showed\nyou?”\n“Yes,” Nila said. She ran her hands over her skirt and stared hard out\nthe window. “It seems,” she said to Adamat, “that General Ket has been\naccused of being a traitor. She has taken three brigades with her and split\noff from the main army. The army is now in a state of civil war.”\nThe General Staff command post was a commandeered farmhouse about a\nmile from the main highway. It sat at the center of the army, some six\nbrigades strong, white soldiers’ tents spiraling outward in an organized but\nultimately loose formation of a camp.\nAdamat and Bo were left waiting, confined to their carriage, for almost\nthree hours before they were finally led inside. Their guards made it clear\nthat the General Staff were all very busy and that their appointment would\ntake up no more than five minutes of the general’s time.\nThe farmhouse consisted of just one large room with stone walls, a\nsquat fireplace at one end and two neatly made sleeping pallets in the\ncorner. The table in the center of the room had one leg too short, and there\nwere no chairs to be seen. Several maps lay on the table, their corners\nweighted by pistols. Adamat glanced over the maps briefly, committing\nthem to his perfect memory, where he could study them later at his leisure.\n“Inspector Adamat.”\nAdamat recognized General Hilanska from a portrait he’d seen once in\nthe royal gallery. He was not a tall man, and significantly overweight due to\ncomplications resulting from the loss of his arm when he was a young\nsoldier. Well into his forties, Hilanska was a celebrated hero who had made\nhis name as an artillery commander in the Gurlish Wars. Rumor had it he\nwas one of Tamas’s most trusted generals.\nAdamat nodded to the general and stepped forward to clasp his\nremaining hand. “This is Counselor Mattias,” he said, introducing Bo.\n“We’ve come on urgent business from Adopest.”\nBo swept off his hat and gave the general a deep bow, but Hilanska"

I’ve turned away dozens of messengers from Adro because I\nsimply don’t have time to deal with domestic issues. You’re only here now\nbecause I know you were on special assignment from Field Marshal Tamas\nbefore he died. I certainly hope you have something important to tell me.\nSergeant Oldrich was rather sparse on the details, I’m afraid, so if you could\n—”\nBo moved forward quickly, cutting Adamat off. “Of course, General,”\nhe said, drawing a sheaf of documents from the case hanging from his\nshoulder. He flipped through several papers before producing one signed\nand stamped by Ricard Tumblar and the judges in Adopest. “I’m sorry we\ncouldn’t provide your men with more details, but this is a delicate matter.\nYou’ll see here that we have a warrant for the arrest of General Ket and her\nsister, Major Doravir.”\nHilanska took the paper from Bo and looked it over for several\nmoments. He handed it back. “Adopest has not been apprised of the\nsituation here?” he asked.\n“What situation?” Adamat said.\n“I have sent several messengers over the course of the last two weeks.\nSurely you’ve been informed…”\n“We have not, sir,” Adamat said.\n“The army has gone to war with itself. General Ket has taken three\nbrigades under her command and split with the main army.”\nThough Nila had told Adamat exactly that, he still didn’t have to fake\nthe shock on his face. “How? Why?”\n“Ket has accused me of treason,” Hilanska said. “She called me a\ntraitor. Said that I was in league with the enemy, and when the rest of the\nGeneral Staff stood behind me, she took her men and broke with us.”\nBo stiffened at Hilanska’s words and his hands twitched toward his\npockets – to his gloves, no doubt. “And there is no basis for this accusation?\nNo evidence?”\n“Of course not!” Hilanska snatched his cane and climbed to his feet.\n“She based her claim on the report of an infantryman who said he saw me\nconspiring with enemy messengers.”\n“And were you?” Bo asked. Adamat shot him a look, but the damage\nhad been done.\nHilanska snapped back, “Of course not. It was one of her Dredgers, a\nconvict from the Mountainwatch. The worst kind of scum. To think she\nbelieved him over me…” He shook his head sadly. “Ket and I have known\none another for decades. We’ve never been friends, but we certainly haven’t\nbeen enemies. I never thought she would make such a baseless accusation.\nUnless…” He held his hand out for the arrest warrant and Bo obliged him.\nHis eyes skimmed the page. “Unless she’s trying to cover her tracks.”\nAdamat exchanged a glance with Bo. “We came to a similar"

    "text": "Unless…” He held his hand out for the arrest warrant and Bo obliged him.\nHis eyes skimmed the page. “Unless she’s trying to cover her tracks.”\nAdamat exchanged a glance with Bo. “We came to a similar\nconclusion ourselves, but in regard to the court-martial of Taniel Two-shot.\nTaniel sent Ricard Tumblar a message asking him to look into Ket’s\naccounts, and it was what put us onto her track.”\n“Tamas’s boy did that? He’s twice as clever as Ket thought him.\nIncredibly sad, that.”\nBo slipped to one side of Hilanska, moving casually, a hand dipping\ninto his pocket. “What’s sad about it?”\n“Taniel was captured by the Kez,” Hilanska said. “Raised above their\narmy like a trophy.”\n“No.” Bo swallowed hard, his hand coming out of his pocket without\nhis gloves.\n“The whole army saw it. Rumor has it he tried to go after Kresimir\nhimself.” Hilanska shook his head. “I watched that boy grow from a lad.\nI’m just glad Tamas wasn’t alive to see it.”\nAdamat tried to focus on Hilanska’s tics – the way his left hand fiddled\nwith the empty right sleeve of his jacket, the way his eyes moved around\nthe room. The general was working his way around the truth. He’d told him\nsome of it, but not all.\nUnfortunately Adamat had no way of discovering what Hilanska was\nleaving out.\n“And he’s dead?” Bo asked.\n“They took his body down quickly after his capture. He was only\ndisplayed one day, but he was certainly dead.”\nAdamat shot Bo a glance. The Privileged’s face had gone deathly pale.\nHe blinked as if there were something in his eyes, and his breath grew\nshort. Adamat stepped toward him and offered him his arm, but Bo waved\nhim off before suddenly rushing from the room.\nHilanska watched him go. “Strange man. Did he know Two-shot?”\n“Not that I’m aware of,” Adamat said smoothly. “I was told he’s very\nsensitive to talk of death.”\n“I see.” Hilanska chewed on this a moment, a frown crossing his\nweathered face.\n“Sir,” Adamat went on so as not to give Hilanska time to consider Bo’s\nbehavior, “do you have a plan to close this schism and face the Kez?” If\nTwo-shot was truly dead, Adamat would have to salvage the situation.\nWould Bo still help Adamat recover his son? Or was Adamat now on his\nown? Regardless, Adamat felt some duty to country that he should do what\nhe could to reunite the army.\nHilanska headed to the table, where he swept his hand to clear the\nbrigade markers and began to awkwardly roll up one of the maps with his\none hand. “I don’t think I should talk of tactics with you, Inspector.”\n“Tactics? Will there be a battle?” Adran fighting Adran? The Kez\ngreatly outnumbered the Adran army, and infighting would be sure to doom\nthem all. It was a miracle that the Kez had not yet taken advantage of the\ninfighting to attack. Adamat’s thoughts whirled as he tried to reorganize his\npriorities."

    "text": "them all. It was a miracle that the Kez had not yet taken advantage of the\ninfighting to attack. Adamat’s thoughts whirled as he tried to reorganize his\npriorities.\n“Of course not. We are doing everything within our power to settle this\namicably. In fact, with this new evidence I may be able to sway Ket’s allies\naway from her. If that lawyer can get his stomach back, have him bring me\nevery bit of paperwork he has. We can show the officers that Ket is just\ntrying to cover up her own crimes. At the very least it will reassure the men\nthat we are on the side of the right.”\n“Certainly,” Adamat said. “But the Kez —”\n“We have this in hand,” Hilanska cut him off. “Don’t worry yourself\nany further. I trust that you will return to Adopest and assure the council we\nwill heal this fracture and turn back the Kez threat, and then we will return\nto deal with the Brudanians.”\nIt was the first time Hilanska had mentioned the foreign army that held\nAdopest. Adamat opened his mouth to ask him what he meant, but the\ngeneral waved his hand to signal an end to their meeting and turned his\nback.\nAdamat found Bo sitting outside the farmhouse, his back to the stone\nwall and the tails of his jacket in the mud. Adamat grabbed him under the\nelbow. “Come on.”\n“Leave me be.”\n“Come on,” Adamat insisted, pulling him up. He spoke in a fierce\nwhisper to get Bo’s attention, leading him away from Hilanska’s guards.\n“We still have work to do.”\n“Bugger it all. You heard him. Taniel’s dead.” Bo jerked away from\nAdamat.\n“Quiet down! He may not be dead.”\nBo looked as if he’d been slapped. “What do you mean?”\nAdamat felt instant guilt at giving Bo any false sense of hope. “Well,\nlet’s at least confirm Hilanska’s story before you go into mourning. Taniel\nmay be a Kez captive, or he may have escaped, or…” He trailed off. Bo\nregarded him with suspicious skepticism.\n“Why the optimism?” Bo asked. “Shouldn’t you be hoping that\nTaniel’s dead so we can go about finding your boy? Or are you just afraid\nthat I’ll go back on my word?”\nAdamat was afraid that Bo would go back on his word. “Something is\nbothering me about Hilanska. The maps on his table.” Adamat pictured\nthem in his mind, turned them around, and considered them before\nspeaking. “The only experience I have with battle planning is from my time\nat the academy, but I’d bet my pension that Hilanska is planning on\nsandwiching Ket’s force between his own and the Kez.”\n“It would be sound reasoning on his part,” Bo said.\n“Not if he’s trying to reunite the brigades, as he claims.”\nBo shrugged and looked off into the distance, his face sullen.\n“Bo,” Adamat said. “Bo!” He reached around and grabbed Bo by the\nfront of his jacket, turning them face-to-face. Bo jerked his jacket out of\nAdamat’s hands and stepped back. Adamat followed him forward and\nslapped Bo across the face."

Adamat followed him forward and\nslapped Bo across the face.\nA thrill of fear went up his spine. He’d just slapped a Privileged. Holy\npit. What had he done? “Pull yourself together,” he said, trying not to let his\nvoice quake.\nBo’s mouth hung open, one Privileged glove in his hand ready to be\npulled over his fingers. “I’ve killed men for less.”\n“You have?”\n“Well. I’ve thought about it. I’m sure other Privileged have. You have\nseconds to tell me why you thought that necessary.”\n“Because we have a duty here. This is bigger than one man. This is the\nfate of our family and our friends and our country.”\n“You don’t understand why I’m here, do you, Inspector?” Bo said.\n“I’m here because Taniel Two-shot is my only friend. He’s my only family.\nPrivileged normally do not have the luxury of either, and I’ll be damned if\nyou think this country means more to me than that.”\nAdamat took a deep breath, relieved that Bo didn’t try to kill him then\nand there. He whispered, “If Hilanska butchers these proceedings, my\nchildren will wind up as slaves to the Kez. I have to try and make sure that\ndoesn’t happen. If the best way to do that is to help you find your friend,\nthen so be it. You need to get a hold of yourself and discreetly ask around\nabout Taniel. I’m going to look into Hilanska.”\nBo blinked several times, taking shaky breaths, and seemed to regain\nsome of his composure. “We’re forgetting the mercenaries.”\nThe turn of conversation was so quick it took Adamat a moment to\ncatch up. Of course. The Wings of Adom, the mercenary company in the\nemploy of Adro. They should have had several brigades on the front.\nAdamat pictured Hilanska’s map once more, looking for the flags: a saint’s\nhalo with gold wings. There they were, up in the corner. “They’re camped\nabout ten miles from here. Probably trying to keep out of this internal spat.”\n“Smart of them.”\nBo flexed his jaw and stuffed his Privileged glove back into his pocket.\n“Start asking around. Find something out, and do it quickly. Or I’m going to\ngo back in there and question Hilanska my way.”\n“Are you all right?”\n“My cheek is a little sore.”\n“I meant about Taniel.”\nBo looked as if he’d swallowed something sour. “A moment of\nweakness, that’s all.

    "text": "where the uniforms of half a dozen soldiers sat piled on her bench. The\nwoman filled her washing pot with the water and sat back to wait for it to\nboil, drawing a soiled hand across her brow.\nA different choice sometime in the last few months and Nila knew that\nmight have been her. She glanced down at her hands. For years they had\nbeen cracked and worn by the soap, water, and lye she’d used to do laundry.\nNow they seemed remarkably smooth to the touch and, Bo told her, they\nwould be put to better use.\nA Privileged. She still couldn’t believe it, not even after seeing the fire\nspring from her own fingertips the first time and during all their practice\nsince.\nPrivileged were creatures of great cunning and strength. They\ncommanded the elements and made armies quake. It seemed so crass that a\nlaundress without family or connections could suddenly hold such power.\nShe couldn’t help but feel cheated as well. Had she known it lay\ndormant within her, she might have used that power to escape from Vetas or\nto protect the royalists. Nila clenched her fist and felt a slight warmth on the\nback of her hand – fire, blue and white, dancing across her knuckles as if\nthey were at the center of a hearth. Glancing around to see if anyone had\nnoticed, she shook her hand to put out the fire and then hid it behind her\nback.\nShe thought about her time with the royalists and remembered Rozalia,\nthe Privileged who had fought for them. Had Rozalia sensed the latent\npower within Nila and simply chosen not to mention it? Or had she been\nkind to her for some other reason? Would Nila become like her someday –\nold, wise, and powerful? Would people be nervous around her as she had\nbeen nervous around Rozalia?\n“Risara!”\nNila emerged from deep within her own thoughts, and it took her a\nmoment to remember that was the name she was using as she pretended to\nbe a secretary to Bo – who himself was masquerading as a lawyer. She\nturned her head to see him hurrying toward her from across the camp. There\nwas an urgency to his step that concerned her.\n“Did you find Taniel?”\n“No.” Bo took her by the arm and stepped around to the far side of the\ncarriage, where they were less likely to be overheard. “General Hilanska\nsays that Taniel’s dead.”\nThe dispassionate way Bo spoke the words made her step back. Taniel\nhad been his obsession ever since he had taken her and Jakob under his\nwing. His only friend, he claimed. He had been searching for Taniel for\nmonths now with a passion that Nila had found inspiring. And now this? Bo\ncould be distant at times, even cold, but this…\n“There’s something else?” she asked.\n“We’re going to find out for sure. Adamat thinks there’s a chance he’s\nstill alive, and Hilanska is only one man.”\nNila realized he wasn’t dispassionate – he was dazed.\n“Where do we stand?”\n“Hilanska has dismissed us, but I’m not leaving until I can confirm\nthat Taniel is dead. I want a body or a grave or something more than just\nHilanska’s word. I’ll even go to the Kez camp if I have to. Adamat is"

Adamat is\ncorroborating Hilanska’s story with the soldiers. I’m going to do the same.”\nHe paused and looked her up and down. “This will be dangerous. If\nHilanska finds out who I am, I may be killed outright – along with you,\nAdamat, Oldrich, and his men.”\n“Just for impersonating a lawyer?”\nA smile tugged at the corner of Bo’s face, but he stifled it quickly.\n“I’m serious. Hilanska doesn’t like or trust Privileged. He’s a man with\nsomething to hide, and the mere fact that we’re snooping around is going to\ngain his suspicion. He’s like Tamas – he’ll do what’s expedient. Even if it\nmeans killing a whole lot of people.”\n“That seems like something you would respect.”\n“And I can respect it by not letting him know what I really am. Or\nwhat you are, for that matter.” He glanced down at her hands and fell into a\nlong silence. He had told her that no Privileged but the gods could touch the\nElse without runed gloves to keep them from being burned from the inside\nout by pure sorcery.\nExcept for her, apparently. And she was far from a god.\nShe had no doubt that if she said the word, Bo would send her back to\nAdopest today. This was her opportunity to run. She could fetch Jakob and\ngo into hiding, using the funds that Bo had left for her. She would be able to\nget out of danger.\nIf she left now, she would never learn how to control her new powers.\nShe would never find a Privileged as patient or thoughtful or just downright\nhuman as Bo. And she would never get the chance to repay him for the\nkindness he’d shown her and Jakob.\n“What can I do?” Nila asked.\nNila waited inside the small wood-and-stone building that had, according to\none of the soldiers, at one point been a stable.\nThe building barely had a roof, and the door was nothing more than a\nscrap of cowhide, but it seemed that the quartermaster of the Twelfth\nBrigade was making do. The floors were covered in straw and every\navailable space was stacked with wooden crates and powder kegs.\nBo had told her to ask around about Taniel Two-shot, stifling her\nprotests that his instructions were rather vague, and left her to her own\ndevices. He wasn’t exactly the image of rousing leadership.\nShe didn’t know how to go about asking soldiers about the death of\ntheir own. It seemed crass. So she thought she’d put what she did know to\ngood use.\nDespite the horror of being Lord Vetas’s prisoner, she had learned\nmany valuable lessons. One of those was the worth of good record keeping,\nand how it could be used against the very people who kept those records.\nThe cowhide was swept aside and a woman of about fifty ambled into\nthe room wearing an Adran-blue army jacket with the quartermaster’s pin\non her collar. She was a slim woman, carrying most of her weight around\nher hips, and her graying hair was tucked into a bun behind her head."

She was a slim woman, carrying most of her weight around\nher hips, and her graying hair was tucked into a bun behind her head.\n“How can I help you, my dear?” she asked, dropping carelessly onto a\npowder keg.\n“My name is Risara,” Nila said, smoothing the front of her skirt. “I’m\nthe secretary to Counselor Mattias of Adopest and I need access to the\nbrigade records.”\n“Well then.” The quartermaster sniffed. “I’ll have to clear that with\nGeneral Hilanska.”\nNila produced an attaché case from beneath her arm and opened it on\nher lap, taking great pains to leaf through the official-looking documents\nwithin. She withdrew one in particular and handed it to the quartermaster.\n“This is a warrant granting me access to whatever records I wish to see. Do\nyou think this is something the general wants to deal with during the current\nturmoil?”\nThe quartermaster read the warrant over twice. Nila tried not to let her\nnervousness show. The warrant was perfectly valid, but Bo had warned her\nthat the army operated outside civilian judicial purview – whether legal or\nnot.\n“All right,” the quartermaster said, handing the document back to Nila.\n“What do you want to see?”\nNila tried not to show her surprise at being granted access so easily or\nto let on that she didn’t actually know what she was looking for. What\nwould help her track down Taniel? His movements before his reported\ndeath? “Give me a copy of all requisition reports of the last two months.”\n“All of them?” The quartermaster rocked back on her powder keg.\n“That’s several hundred pages.”\n“Get a scribe in here. I’ll wait.”\nThe quartermaster grumbled under her breath and began sorting\nthrough the crates piled in one corner. Nila waited, trying to put on as\npatient an air as possible. Lord Vetas had forced her to run many of his\nerrands – not all of them strictly legal – and she had quickly learned that if\nshe only acted like she belonged someplace most people would assume she\ndid.\n“Is there anything else you need?” the quartermaster said, wrist-deep\nin sheaves of paper. “I don’t want to have to go through all this again.”\n“What records do you have on individual officers?”\nThe quartermaster lifted a pile of worn yellow paper almost as thick as\nNila’s hand was wide. “You’d have to see the general’s adjutant for that.”\n“Of course.” Nila took the records from the quartermaster and leafed\nthrough them. “Do you need to make copies?”\n“They’re all in triplicate. That’s why the column for order signatures is\nblank. I’ll have another copy made up when someone has time. Anything\nyou’re looking for in particular?”\nNila hesitated a moment. If she mentioned her goal, it might raise\nsuspicion. But the idea of combing through all those reports was incredibly\ndaunting. “Do you know if Captain Taniel Two-shot made any requisition\norders?”\n“He did.” The quartermaster scratched her head for a minute as if to\nrun through her memory. “There are a few dozen, I think.

I can’t tell you the\nexact days, but any requests made by a powder mage are marked with a\n‘pm’ in the order column.”\n“You’ve been most helpful. Thank you. Do you mind if I look through\nthe copies here?”\nThe quartermaster shrugged her bony shoulders. “Fine by me. You’ll\nhave to excuse me for a moment, though. I’ll just be takin’ a piss.”\nNila was left alone with the records. It took her a few minutes to get a\nfeel for how the pages were organized. They were covered in small script\nand several columns. Names, dates, orders, and whether they were fulfilled.\nThere were notes in half a dozen different handwritings – various\nquartermasters, she assumed. Once she found the first ‘pm’ – a request by\nTaniel for more powder, which was denied – it wasn’t hard to spot more.\nShe had just found the fifth powder request when she heard the old\nquartermaster behind her.\n“Right there,” the woman said. Nila glanced up out of politeness, only\nto see herself trapped in the small building by two big soldiers. The men\nwore dark-blue Adran uniforms with red trim and tall bearskin hats. Not\nregular soldiers. Grenadiers.\n“Ma’am,” one of them said, “would you come with us, please.”\nNila’s heart was in her throat. “Is something the matter?”\n“Please,” he said again. “Come with us.” He glanced behind him, as if\nnervous. “Try not to make a ruckus, ma’am.”\nNila didn’t see that she had much choice. She could yell and scream,\nwith only a small chance of attracting Bo. But even then, what could Bo\ndo? For the purpose of this mission they were not in a friendly camp. “Of\ncourse, just let me gather my things.” Nila scooped up the requisition\norders, securing the whole thing with a string, and forced them into her\nattaché case before following the men out of the building.\n“Stay with us, please,” one of the men said in a low voice before\nmoving on ahead. The other, Nila noted, fell back some ten paces. It was\nalmost as if they didn’t want to be seen with her.\nShe was led past General Hilanska’s headquarters and over a slight rise\nand into another part of the camp. She examined the various standards,\ntrying to remember the brigades and regiments of the Adran army and\nfailing completely. If not General Hilanska, who were they taking her to\nsee? Or were they taking her straight to the stockade?\nThe man in front of her suddenly stopped beside a white-walled tent\nand turned as if taking up the guard. He gestured to the flap. “Go on in.”\nThe other soldier had disappeared. Nila stared at the tent for a moment,\nboth curious and fearful about what she’d find inside. She clenched her jaw.\nShe was a Privileged now. She was going to have to get used to danger –\nand taking risks.

He didn’t look up when Nila entered, only pointed to the chair\nopposite him and continued to write. Nila looked around carefully. No sign\nof danger here, though that could all change in a moment in a camp full of\nsoldiers. She took the offered seat.\nBy the size of the tent, Nila guessed that this man was an officer. He\nwas a big man, well over six feet tall standing, with wide shoulders and\nthick arms. He had a face that looked like it had been punched one too\nmany times, with a crooked nose and high cheekbones. His chair was\nwheeled, of the kind used by invalids.\nShe spotted the man’s army jacket hanging in one corner, with two\nhawks over the Adran Mountains emblazoned on the shoulder. It also held\nfour bars over a chevron – Nila knew enough to recognize he was a colonel.\nHad she read something in the newspaper recently about a colonel being\nparalyzed in a heroic action?\nHe finally stopped writing and pushed himself up straight in his chair.\n“You’re the girl that came in with the lawyer this afternoon?” he asked.\n“I am Counselor Mattias’s secretary.”\n“How long have you been with the counselor?” The colonel watched\nher face intently.\n“I’m not sure what you’re asking.”\n“It’s a direct question,” the colonel said. “How long have you been\nwith him? Are you in his confidence?”\nNila knew she had to make a decision. Throw everything in behind Bo\n– be there if he was exposed and killed – or pretend that she was nothing\nmore than a hired secretary.\n“Some time. I am in his confidence, sir.”\nThe colonel’s eyes narrowed. “Indeed? Then what’s the Privileged up\nto?”\nNila forced herself not to bolt for the tent flap. “I don’t know what —”\n“Stop,” the man said. “I’ve known Taniel Two-shot since he was a boy.\nYou think I wouldn’t recognize his best friend?”\n“I’m sorry, sir,” Nila said. “I don’t know your name.”\n“Colonel Etan.”\n“Colonel Etan. If you think you know someone, shouldn’t you invite\nthem to your tent directly?”\nThe shadow of a smile touched Etan’s face. “Is Borbador here looking\nfor Taniel?”\nNila couldn’t avoid a direct question like that. This man claimed to\nknow Taniel. This may be the best way to get information out of him. Or it\ncould all be a trap. “Yes,” she said.\nEtan gave a soft sigh, closing his eyes. “Thank Adom.”\n“I’m sorry?”\nEtan opened his eyes again. “I’ve spent the last several weeks trying to\nfind out what happened to Taniel. Nobody has seen him since he was raised\nup like a trophy above the Kez camp. Hilanska has refused to ask any\nquestions. He won’t even request Taniel’s body back from the Kez.”\nNila’s throat felt dry. “So Taniel is dead?”\n“I don’t know,” Etan said. “He was alive when he was raised up on"

He was alive the last time anyone saw him up there, and then\nwhen Kresimir killed Adom, he —”\n“Wait, what?” Nila couldn’t help herself. She leaned forward in her\nchair. “Kresimir killed Adom? What are you talking about?” Was this man\nmad?\nEtan waved his hand. “It’s a very long story. One that hasn’t gotten\nback to Adopest, it seems. Pit, Hilanska is keeping a tight lid around here.\nTo answer your earlier question, I deemed it unwise to bring Borbador here.\nI’m hoping that you are being watched less closely than the supposed\n‘lawyer’ is.”\n“You want me to pass him a message?”\n“Yes. Don’t trust Hilanska.”\n“I don’t think Bo trusts anyone.”\nEtan scowled at his legs. He didn’t seem to hear her. “Hilanska is a\nsuperior officer and I do him a disservice, but he’s been acting very\nstrangely lately. As I said before, he won’t look into Taniel’s whereabouts.\nHe adamantly refuses to believe that Tamas might still be alive. What’s\nmore, he’s been putting all of Tamas’s most loyal men into their own\ncompanies and promoting his own longest-serving soldiers. And he’s been\nraving about a Kez pincer movement that could come over the southern\nmountains – he sent two whole companies into the valleys in the southwest,\nwhere they won’t be able to do a damned thing when the Kez do attack.”\nNila couldn’t pretend to understand the inner politics of the army, but\nshe imagined it not unlike anywhere else that people were constantly\njockeying for rank or status – even like the noble household where she had\nbeen employed before the coup. She did know that Bo wouldn’t care one\nwhit for the army politics. But Etan was clearly distraught, and she didn’t\nthink it would help to tell him that.\n“Are you able to help us find Taniel?” she asked gently.\nEtan glanced at the attaché case in her hands. “I’ve gone through all of\nTaniel’s requisition forms. I was there when he made some of them. I don’t\nthink they’ll help you, but I suppose another set of eyes wouldn’t hurt. I’ve\ndone everything within my power to discover his fate – I’ve been watching\nfor anyone who might come asking, as well. Bo might have to go to the Kez\nto get any more information.”\n“That would be suicide,” Nila said. Not that it would stop Bo.\n“It might. I’m sorry that I could not be more help. I’m leaving for\nAdopest in the morning. If there’s anything I can do to aid your search,\ncontact me through one of the grenadiers of the Twelfth.”\n“Thank you,” Nila said.\nShe left the colonel and headed back across the camp toward where\nthey had left their carriage. What else could she do now but wait for Bo and\ntell him about Etan? Etan’s advice had been unhelpful, but she hoped it\nwould make Bo more optimistic to know they had a friend in the camp and"

Etan’s advice had been unhelpful, but she hoped it\nwould make Bo more optimistic to know they had a friend in the camp and\nthat Taniel had last been seen alive.\nTheir carriage had been moved off the road and down into a gully and\nthe horses unharnessed. She sat in the carriage to read through the reports,\ngoing through every page one by one, carefully examining each line to be\nsure she didn’t miss any of Taniel’s requisitions. The column that interested\nher the most was the one where the quartermasters entered their own notes\nabout the requisition. Up to a certain point in time, each of Taniel’s requests\nfor black powder had been denied “by order of the General Staff.”\nUntil about a month previous. He was given powder, and the note\ncolumn said, “Special permission, General Hilanska.” Nila set that page\naside to show to Bo.\nIt grew dark, and Nila finally had to set aside her work. It seemed\nstrange to her that neither Bo nor Adamat had returned yet. In fact, she\nhadn’t seen Sergeant Oldrich or his men either. She leaned her head against\nthe wall of the carriage, wondering if she should go look for them or just\nrest here until they returned.\nNila thought she heard a soft click from the opposite door of the\ncarriage. She turned, but the carriage door was still closed.\n“Hello?” she asked. When there was no response, she put her hand to\nher door latch and it occurred to her that in a camp of many tens of\nthousands, there didn’t seem to be anyone close to her carriage.\nThe opposite door suddenly swung open. Nila glimpsed a dark coat, a\ncovered face, and the dull glint of steel in the moonlight. The carriage\nrocked as someone dove inside. A hand darted toward her.\nNila threw herself across the carriage, felt a knife catch in her skirts.\nShe twisted away and heard a low curse in a man’s voice as her attacker\ntried to drag his blade from the cloth. She rolled onto the flat of the blade\nand kicked out at the man’s shoulder.\nHe pulled back with a grunt, the knife no longer in his hand, only to\nleap bodily upon her.\nShe caught him under the shoulders. He batted at her arms, pushing\nthem down, one hand snaking around her neck. She felt his fingers close\nabout her throat and remembered Lord Vetas’s hot breath upon her shoulder\nwhen he had done the same.\nThe man hissed suddenly, jumping away from her, his jacket on fire.\nNila felt the pressure leave her throat, saw the flame dancing on her\nfingertips, and she leapt on top of the man, fueled by the coals of her rage.\nHe tried to grapple with her, his attention taken by his burning coat, but\nNila forced herself inside his guard.\nHer hand still aflame, she grasped the man’s face and pushed.\nSkin and bone seemed to give way beneath her fingers. The man’s\nscream died in his throat and his body stopped moving.

Nila slowly backed away. Her head hit\nthe roof of the carriage and she ducked down, unable to pull her eyes away\nfrom the corpse lying in the smoldering remains of its own clothing.\nShe looked down at her hand. It was covered in cooked bits of bone\nand flesh.\n“Nila, are you —”\nBo jerked open the door she had been resting against just a few\nmoments before and stared down at the body. His face was unreadable in\nthe darkness.\n“Come here,” he said gently, taking her by the wrist and pulling her\noutside. She only noticed the acrid smell of smoke and burned flesh, hair,\nand wool as Bo led her away. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and\ngently cleaned her hand, emptying some of his canteen onto her fingers. He\nwent back to the carriage and fetched her attaché case.\n“I…” She seemed barely able to take a breath. Her heart thundered and\nher hands shook.\nShe’d just killed a man by burning through his entire head. With her\nhand.\n“We’ll leave the luggage. I’d set fire to the carriage, but it would just\nattract attention all the sooner. They’ve arrested Oldrich and his men. We\nhave to go find Adamat.”\nNila looked at her hand, clean now of the charred gore. The phantom\nstickiness of the blood clung between her fingers. She forced herself to look\nup into Bo’s eyes. She had to be strong. “And if he’s captured as well?”\n“We’ll save him if we can. If not, he’s on his own.”\n“And all of Oldrich’s soldiers?”\nBo looked about them furtively. “Not even I can get fifteen men out of\nan army encampment. They’ll have to face the firing squad for us. Now,\nlet’s go.” He pulled at her arm.\n“No,” Nila said.\n“What do you mean, ‘no’?”\n“You – we – brought them into this. We’ll get them out.”\n“Damn it, Nila,” Bo hissed. “We’d have to have help, and we simply\ndon’t have it.”\nNila tilted her head to one side. “Yes we do,” she said.\nCHAPTER 5\nA\ndamat was only able to spend about three hours asking questions before\nthe provosts came for him.\nHe was in the middle of speaking with a young sergeant about her\ncousin in the Third Brigade under General Ket’s command when he felt a\nhand at his elbow. He turned, expecting to find Nila or Bo there with some\nkind of news, but instead looked over and up – and up some more – at the\nmilitary police officer standing beside him. The man had a barrel chest, and\nwhen he spoke, his voice sounded like an echo.\n“Inspector Adamat?”\n“Yes.”\n“You’re to come with me.”\nAdamat grasped the head of his cane tightly and raised his eyebrows.\n“I’m sorry, I’m just in the middle of an interview. You’ll have to wait.” He\nturned back to the sergeant, hoping that was enough to put off the provost."

You’ll have to wait.” He\nturned back to the sergeant, hoping that was enough to put off the provost.\n“Now,” the man’s voice rang out.\nThe sergeant leaned over to Adamat. “Inspector, you better go with\nhim.”\nAdamat let out a small sigh, gathered his hat in his hands, and faced\nthe provost. “What’s this about?”\n“You’re to come with me.”\n“Yes, I gathered that much. I’m an Adran citizen and I have the right to\nask why I’m being gathered by an officer of the peace.”\nThe provost tilted his head to one side. “This is a military jurisdiction\nand you have no such rights as would be afforded to you by an Adran\nprovost. Now, will you come along or shall I drag you?”\nNot as daft as he looked, unfortunately. Adamat gave him a firm nod.\n“I’ll come along, but under protest.”\n“Protest all you like. This way.”\nAdamat made sure to grumble loudly in an inconvenienced sort of way\nas they headed through the camp. Inside, though, his heart was hammering.\nHe had expected the provosts to come after him sooner or later. After all, if\nHilanska was indeed keeping secrets, he wouldn’t want someone snooping\naround. Adamat hadn’t expected them to be so quick about it.\nHad Hilanska questioned Oldrich? Or perhaps one of his soldiers had\nrecognized Bo? There were too many things that could go wrong, it was\nimpossible to plan for them all. Perhaps the girl had lost her nerve and run\nto Hilanska herself.\nAdamat dismissed the last option. That laundress, whoever she was,\nhad steel in her eyes.\nThe camp stockade was nothing more than a trio of prison wagons\nnear where the brigade’s cavalry hitched their horses for the night. Adamat\nwas led over to the closest and one of the guards unlocked the door.\nThe big provost took Adamat by the shoulder and pushed him toward\nthe wagon. Adamat gritted his teeth, wanting to reprimand the man, but\nknew this was no time to be making enemies. All three wagons were\nalready full – of Oldrich and his men.\nAdamat’s cane was taken away and he stepped inside.\nOldrich regarded him sourly. “I see the Privileged’s plan is off to a\nwonderful start,” he said when the guards had gone on to do their rounds.\n“When did they come for you?” Adamat asked.\n“Not more than half an hour ago.”\n“Did they say why?”\nOldrich shook his head. “They got us while we were split up. Some of\nthe boys were at the mess, two others at the latrine. It was all done very\nquiet, and they were sure to outnumber us by three to one.” He leaned over\nto the bars of the prison wagon and spit. “It’s bad when they come quietly.\nThe provosts love to flaunt their power.”\n“They’re acting like we’re enemies of the state,” one of the other\nsoldiers said. There was a round of nods, and he added, “We wouldn’t get\ntreated like this by the field marshal.”\nOldrich looked over his shoulder. “The field marshal isn’t here,” he"

There was a round of nods, and he added, “We wouldn’t get\ntreated like this by the field marshal.”\nOldrich looked over his shoulder. “The field marshal isn’t here,” he\nsaid. “You boys just remember – you were following orders. If anyone’s\ngoing to take the fall it’ll be me.” He examined Adamat, as if wondering if\nit was worth getting court-martialed or worse on his behalf.\nBy the sullen silence among the men, Adamat guessed that they’d had\nthis conversation already.\n“When are they going to question us?” Adamat asked. He had little\nexperience with provosts, but he could only imagine the worst: Hilanska\nwanted to cover something up. He’d torture them all to find out what they\nknew, and then have them executed quietly.\n“Depends on how big of a hurry they’re in. And how big of a hornet’s\nnest you kicked by asking questions. Could be they’ll just hold us a couple\nof days and then let us go.” Oldrich didn’t sound optimistic about that\noutcome.\nThe night drew on and Adamat watched the tents, waiting to see\nHilanska’s provosts return to collect them for questioning. The hours\npassed. The more he thought about it, the more he realized Oldrich was\nprobably right: Hilanska just wanted to keep them from complicating\nthings. He needed them out of the way and that was it. They were still in a\ntight place, but the belief helped Adamat to relax.\nHe was just beginning to doze, his shoulders up against the cold steel\nof the prison wagon walls, when he heard a hiss behind his ear.\nHe turned to find Bo right behind him. “How long have you been\nhere?” Bo asked through the bars.\nAdamat shook away the sleep. “A few hours, I think.”\n“The sentries are unconscious. We have a few minutes until the guard\nmakes their rounds. We have to go. Now.”\nAdamat hesitated. If Hilanska only wanted to hold them for a time, an\nescape attempt would only make things worse. Bo moved around to the\nfront of the prison wagon and licked the end of his gloved finger. He\ntwitched his fingers twice and then set it against the steel of the lock.\n“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Adamat asked.\n“They tried to kill Nila,” Bo said. “They don’t want us quiet – they\nwant us dead. Nila! Get the other wagon.”\nAdamat turned to see Nila rush over to one of the other prison wagons.\nShe glanced around, as if self-conscious, then held one hand out in front of\nher, palm up as if holding a fruit. Adamat frowned at the gesture. What was\nshe doing?\nA cold blue flame danced over the palm of her hand. She reached out\nand grabbed the lock. Steel melted in her hand, dripping to the ground with\na sizzle. One of the soldiers swore under his breath.\nThis girl was a Privileged? No wonder Bo had insisted on bringing her\nalong! But where were her gloves? Adamat didn’t have time to think about\nit as he was pushed out the front of the prison wagon by whispering\nsoldiers.\n“How the pit are we all getting out of the camp?” Adamat hissed to\nBo."

He gave a low whistle, and two men suddenly\nemerged from the blackness near the hitching posts. They both stood well\nover six feet tall and each carried a bundle of blue-and-crimson uniforms in\ntheir arms. “Oldrich,” Bo said. “Get your men dressed. They’ve just joined\nthe grenadiers of the Twelfth Brigade. You too, Adamat. Over your clothes,\nboys. We can’t leave them any sign of how we escaped.”\nAdamat snatched one of the uniforms and pulled it on over his suit. It\nwas an awkward fit, the uniform was made for someone far larger. The\njacket followed, and he was handed a bearskin hat.\nNila went down the line, straightening uniforms and tugging them to\nfit here and there. She joined Adamat and Bo and gestured over the two\ngrenadiers. “You’re part of Colonel Etan’s honor guard,” she said to\nAdamat, “escorting him up to Adopest. He was going to leave in the\nmorning, but word of a sickness in his family has him riding out tonight.”\n“And we can trust this Colonel Etan?”\nBo hesitated for a moment, and then nodded. “One of Taniel’s friends.”\nAdamat looked between Bo and Nila. Neither was wearing a uniform.\n“And what about you?”\n“We’re making our own way out,” Bo said. He didn’t elaborate further.\n“And this civil war?” Adamat asked.\n“Not my problem.”\nNila gave Adamat an apologetic look.\n“Get a move on,” Bo said. “The guard changes in an hour. We’ll wait\nhere to make sure your disappearance isn’t noticed before the colonel can\nget you out, then I’ll make a false trail running for the Adsea. They’ll\nassume you’ve escaped by boat.”\nAdamat suppressed the urge to thank him. After all, he wouldn’t be\nhere if it weren’t for Bo’s urging. “And my boy?” He needed to get his son\nback, and Bo was the only one who could help him do it.\n“I’m going to find Taniel, and then I’ll come get you in Adopest. You\nhave my word.”\nAdamat gave the Privileged a tight nod and followed Oldrich and his\nmen after the two grenadiers. They were led through the camp at a double\nmarch and Adamat struggled to keep up. Oldrich’s men were Adran\nsoldiers. They might not have been as big as grenadiers, but they could play\nthe part without too much of a stretch. Adamat was older than most of these\nmen by ten years, softened by his own age and family life.

Just over thirty, he had risen through\nthe ranks by distinguishing himself in battle during one of the many small\nwars in Gurla after the Gurlish campaigns had supposedly ended. His rise\nmight have seemed swift, but was less strange when Adamat considered\nhow short an average grenadier’s career normally was. Shock troops didn’t\noften last long, and few enough of the big men were known for their\nintelligence.\nAdamat also remembered reading in the papers just a couple of weeks\nback that Etan had been wounded in battle. Paralyzed, the article had said.\nHis breath sounding ragged in his ears, he caught sight of a waiting\ncarriage near the edge of the camp, surrounded by an honor guard of some\nfifty grenadiers. Several grenadiers stood by with rifles and kits. Adamat,\nOldrich, and the rest were hastily outfitted.\n“Fall in, men!” a captain called. “Damned dogs, arriving late! You’re\nnot worthy to carry the colonel on your backs! Not worthy to bathe his feet.\nIt’ll be latrine duty for all of you when you get back!” He ran up and down\nthe line, slapping at their knees with his riding crop.

He\ndared not drop it.\n“Yes sir!” he said with the others.\nThe captain stopped beside him and leaned forward, speaking low. “If\nyou cause trouble for my colonel, I’ll kill you myself.” He moved on before\nAdamat could reply.\nA hand reached out of the carriage and thumped the side. Adamat had\nbarely begun to catch his breath before they were marching double-time\nagain.\nSweat was already pouring down his face when the carriage trundled\noff the hard-packed dirt of the camp thoroughfare and onto the cobbles of\nthe main highway to Adopest. They came to a slow stop beside the\nnorthernmost checkpoint. Two sentries approached the carriage.\nAdamat wasn’t close enough to hear the ensuing conversation. He\nstood with rifle shouldered, the pack on his back pressing against his spine,\nand hoped that they wouldn’t notice how short he was for a grenadier – or\nthat his uniform was already soaked with sweat and they hadn’t even begun\ntheir march.\nOne of the sentries shrugged and they both stepped back, waving\nEtan’s carriage on. Adamat wasn’t even given a second glance as he trotted\npast them.\nHis legs burned as they continued on into the night, and his lungs felt\non fire. Every wound from the last six months seemed to flare up – his nose\nached, cuts on his stomach and shoulder itched, and bruises he’d not even\nknown existed began to throb. He felt himself lagging behind the other\ngrenadiers – both Oldrich’s men and Etan’s real soldiers – and struggled to\npush himself harder.\nWhat a miserable existence. Who could stomach putting their body\nthrough this kind of abuse? Adamat used his indignation to propel himself"

This whole trip had been a waste. Taniel was likely dead, and it\ncould be weeks or months until Bo returned to help Adamat look for Josep.\nIf he returned at all. Why had he ever agreed to this in the first place?\nAnd this whole affair between Hilanska and Ket. It would prove\nAdro’s undoing, he had no doubt. The more he thought over the map he’d\nseen in Hilanska’s command post, the more he was convinced that the\ngeneral wasn’t just preparing for a fight – he was looking for one.\nWould Ket really accuse Hilanska of being a traitor just to cover her\nown tracks? Perhaps she’d thought more of the General Staff would side\nwith her? Or perhaps she’d thought to sway the Wings of Adom.\nRegardless, she would be crushed between Hilanska and the Kez.\nDid she know that three brigades of Adran infantry would die because\nof her? Was she that selfish?\nAdamat didn’t realize he’d stopped marching until he noticed the\ncarriage and its escort some forty paces ahead of him. He ran to catch up,\nforcing himself to ignore the pain in his knees, and arrived at the back of\nthe line just as the captain called for a stop.\nAdamat shouldered his way through the soldiers, heading toward\nEtan’s carriage, and felt a hand on his chest.\n“I didn’t say to fall out,” the captain said to him. “Back into line before\nI give you a beating.”\n“I have to speak with the colonel,” Adamat said.\n“You’ll do no such thing. Back in line!”\nAdamat didn’t have time for this. His heart beat with a sudden urgency\nthat had nothing to do with this quick march. “I’m not one of your damned\nsoldiers and you know it,” Adamat said. “I appreciate your help, but get out\nof my damned face. I’m on assignment from Field Marshal Tamas himself.”\n“Field Marshal Tamas is —” the captain started, drawing himself up.\n“Captain,” a voice called from the carriage. “Settle down. Let the\ninspector ride with me.”\nAdamat suppressed a triumphant grin. No need to antagonize the man\nfurther. He pushed past the captain and opened the door to the carriage,\nstepping inside.\nIn the darkness it was difficult to see any of Etan’s features. Adamat\nwas certain he was a large man. He was propped in his seat – probably\nstrapped in place, due to his condition – and leaned on a cane.\n“You can get rid of the uniform now,” Etan said. “If someone comes\nafter us now, it won’t be much of a disguise.”\nAdamat removed the bearskin hat and the crimson jacket and breathed\na sigh of relief. He immediately regretted it as the cold night air reached his\nsoaked suit underneath, chilling him to the bone. “Thank you for this help,\nColonel,” Adamat said.\n“It’s the least I could do.” Etan thumped on the side of the carriage and\nthey began to move again. “Taniel saved my life. He was a good friend. I\nknow that you are trying to help him. I just wish we could all have done\nmore.”"

I just wish we could all have done\nmore.”\n“There may be more we can do yet,” Adamat said, and quickly added,\n“for the army, that is.”\nEtan made a noncommittal grunt.\n“This affair between Ket and Hilanska could be the end of Adro,”\nAdamat said.\n“I’ve washed my hands of the whole thing. I’m returning to the north,\nquietly going into retirement. No one has use for a crippled grenadier,\nwhether or not we win the war.”\n“But…”\n“No ‘buts,’ Inspector. I’m glad to help you escape Hilanska’s\nmachinations, but this is the end of it for me.”\n“I understand.” Adamat smacked his fist into his palm in frustration.\nEtan’s next words were hesitant. “If there’s anything I can do to speed\nyou on your way, I’ll do it.”\n“There is,” Adamat said, feeling a surge of renewed hope. “I could use\na letter of introduction.”\n“To whom?”\n“Brigadier Abrax of the Wings of Adom. I think I know how to save\nGeneral Ket’s troops.”\nCHAPTER 6\nT\naniel watched the squad of Adran soldiers as they searched the canyon\nfloor far beneath him.\nHe had been trailing them since they left the Veridi Valley, breaking\noff from the main company two days before. There were twelve of them in\nall, dressed in Adran blues and carrying a full kit on their backs and rifles\nunder their arms. They proceeded warily up the valley, covering less than a\nmile a day and searching every deer trail and crevice along the way.\nAt this rate it would take them two more days to find Ka-poel’s hiding\nplace.\nTaniel fought the urge to stand up and shout. He wanted to rush down\nthe side of the mountain, sliding on the scree, waving his arms to be seen. It\nhad been weeks since he’d had a good meal and a soft bed. His skin was\ncracked and dirty, his body still aching from the beating at the hands of\nKresimir’s soldiers.\nHe’d long since stopped noticing his own smell – a sure sign that he\nwas too used to the foulness.\nThe only thing that kept him silent was the nagging doubt of suspicion.\nIt was more than likely these men were looking for him; the mountains of\nsouthwest Adro were nigh impassable and their immense network of\nvalleys led to nowhere important. Why else would Adran soldiers be up\nhere? The real question was: Why were they looking for him?\nNo one in command had reason to send two companies to find him.\nGeneral Hilanska had betrayed Taniel, betrayed Tamas, and betrayed Adro.\nThese could be his picked men. Or perhaps Tamas had returned and they\nwere friendly.\nSurely they would be shouting for him if they were friendly. He was\nwracked by indecision. At a mile away, it was impossible to recognize any\nof them. Taniel cursed quietly under his breath. If he’d had any black\npowder left, he could have seen them clearly from five miles away.\nIt took him several hours to move down the mountain with enough\nstealth to avoid notice.

His boots were full of grit and his calves burned\nfrom the descent, and it was nearly dusk when Taniel finally crouched in the\nshadow of a boulder some hundred and fifty feet above the squad, his body\nhidden. Sweat poured from his brow. He swore again.\nEach of the soldiers carried a rifle with the bayonet fixed. From a\ndistance the rifles’ basic shape could be mistaken for any flintlock, but from\nhere Taniel could very clearly make out the sleek, streamlined barrel and\nthe rounded stock. These weren’t flintlocks. They were air rifles – they fired\nbullets not with the combustion of black powder but with compressed air.\nThey were delicate, unreliable weapons. Soldiers only carried air rifles\nwhen they needed to kill a powder mage.\nTaniel waited in his hiding spot until after dark, watching the soldiers\nset up camp, and then headed back up the steep side of the mountain.\nTaking goat paths, he crossed over the ridge and then followed it to the\neast for almost a mile, back into a narrow crevice wedged under two great,\nflat boulders.\nKa-poel sat cross-legged with her back against the wall of their cave.\nHer ashen freckles were obscured by mud, her long black duster ripped and\nworn. There were large, dark circles under her eyes. She looked up at Taniel\nand her head bobbed slightly from exhaustion.\n“A squad of Adran soldiers,” Taniel said. “Armed to the teeth with air\nrifles.” He lowered himself down beside her, unwilling to look at the wax\nfigure lying on the dirt before her. “No doubt Hilanska’s men.” He felt the\nfatigue deep in his bones. Every muscle ached and his hands shook from the\nlack of gunpowder. It was progress. A few days ago he had barely been able\nto stand from the withdrawal symptoms. “They’re working their way up the\nvalley. They’ll reach the curve soon, then come up this direction. It won’t\ntake them longer than two days. I can’t sense an ounce of powder on them.”\nHe forced a smile onto his face. Ka-poel leaned her head on his\nshoulder, and Taniel tried to sit up straight. He couldn’t show his own\nweariness. It wouldn’t be fair to her.\nNot after she had rescued him. Her very sorcery gave him strength.\nShe who kept a god in check by the power of her will alone.\nTaniel finally looked down at the wax figure lying in the dust. He\nrecognized that face, from the delicate chin and the golden hair to the ugly\nblack pit where one eye used to be. A rock the size of Taniel’s fist sat in the\ncenter of the wax figure’s chest and one long needle stuck out from its head.\nGently, Taniel pushed Ka-poel’s head off his shoulder. “It’s time,” he\nsaid.\nShe looked up at him, a question in her eyes. He wondered briefly how\nher voice would sound if she were able to speak. He kissed her on the\nforehead and climbed to his feet.\n“I have to go kill my countrymen.”\nTaniel crept down the mountainside just after midnight. The night was deep,"

His whole body shook from the effort\nof the descent, holding himself back so that he wouldn’t disturb the scree or\nstartle small animals out of hiding, and his eyes ached from squinting hard\ninto the darkness.\nHe had the musket that he’d taken in their mad dash from the Kez\ncamp as his only weapon. Bayonet fixed, it would be little use to him\nexcept as a spear, as he lacked both powder and ammunition. He’d left his\njacket behind with Ka-poel, as the silver buttons might have caught errant\nmoonlight and betrayed him to the enemy – his belt buckle he had wrapped\nin leather to hide it.\nHe felt the lack of powder keenly. A single hit of black powder would\nhave sharpened his senses and allowed him to see clearly in the darkness. It\nwould have dulled the ache in his bones, the soreness of his back and feet,\nand would have given him strength and speed, so that dealing with a dozen\nmen would have been…\nWell, certainly not easy. But not outside the realm of possibility, either.\nCrouched on the mountainside, he examined his quarry.\nThe squad of Adran soldiers camped in the shadow of a ten-foot\ncascade with their backs to a shallow recess in the cliff wall. One stood\nguard at the top of the cascade. After several minutes of careful\nexamination Taniel was able to spot the second sentry below the camp,\nabout thirty paces down the valley. It was a good defensive position,\nimpossible to flank.\nBut Taniel wouldn’t be flanking anyone. Not on his own. The waterfall\nwould be the only thing serving to cover his approach.\nHis lack of vision in the darkness was a blow, but he had been\nplanning for the possibility of this ambush for over a week. He knew the lay\nof the terrain by heart. This was one of a half-dozen locations along the\nvalley where scouts might have camped, and he’d been right in his\nassumptions all the way down to where they positioned their sentries.\nTheir Adran blues were difficult to see in the dark, but the silver\nbuttons gave them away. Taniel felt a sudden misgiving. He’d been raised\namong these men and women – perhaps not those hunting him, but certainly\ntheir comrades. These were his brothers and sisters.\nThen why were they hunting him with air rifles? Only Hilanska would\nhave been able to get ahold of so many air rifles in Adro. Only he would be\nable to gather this many Adran soldiers loyal enough to him that they’d be\nwilling to go after a powder mage. I’ve killed Adran soldiers before, he\nreminded himself. General Ket’s vile soldiers, sent after him and Ka-poel. I\ncan do it again.\nThe gravel shifted beneath his feet as he worked his way down to the\ntop of the cascade. The sentry’s head turned slightly and the barrel of her air\nrifle came up. Taniel paused, his breathing shallow. An eternity seemed to\npass until she lowered the barrel of her rifle back toward the ground and she\nturned to the east, looking down the length of the valley."

An eternity seemed to\npass until she lowered the barrel of her rifle back toward the ground and she\nturned to the east, looking down the length of the valley.\nTaniel stepped into the stream and felt the cold water leak in through a\nhole in his boot. Stepping lightly, he worked his way toward the sentry. He\nput one hand to the end of his musket to unfasten the bayonet.\nA cold sweat broke out on the nape of his neck. The bayonet wouldn’t\nbudge. He twisted harder, but with no success.\nHe fought down a rising panic. He could still do this with his bare\nhands, but the lack of a weapon made it both less certain and more personal.\nHe set his musket carefully down on the bank of the stream and took\nthree long steps forward, snaking one arm around the soldier’s neck and\nputting the other against the base of her spine. He squeezed instantly,\nflexing his arm to cut off the flow of air and blood to the brain.\nShe made a quiet choking noise and dropped her rifle with a clatter\ninto the stream. Taniel’s heart leapt at the sound, and he watched over her\nshoulder for signs of alarm in the camp below them while he counted\nquietly in his head.\nTwenty seconds for unconsciousness. Four minutes to be sure of a kill.\nHer desperate clawing slacked off after just eight seconds. Taniel\ncontinued to count, and when it was apparent that no alarm would be raised,\nhe squeezed his eyes shut.\nWhy should he spare any of these soldiers who were hunting him? If a\nsingle one lived through the night, they’d raise the alarm with the company\nback down the valley and Taniel would have two hundred men or more\ncoming straight for him. For Ka-poel.\nThe soldier stopped struggling entirely at eighteen seconds. Taniel kept\nhis grip tight, pulling her close. The killer’s embrace, Tamas had called it.\nHe felt moisture on his cheeks.\nHe remembered a time not so long ago, in the mountains far to the east\nof here, looking down the barrel of his rifle at his best friend, marked for\ndeath because he was a Privileged sorcerer.\nAt thirty seconds he let go of the woman, his rage not enough to fuel\nhis strength. He let her sag in his arms and lowered her gently down to the\nbank of the stream.\nA hand over her mouth felt her shallow breathing. Taniel cursed his\nweakness and made his way quickly down and around the camp. He paused\nonce when one of the sleeping soldiers stirred, but the soldier merely\nmumbled something unintelligible and rolled over, going back to sleep.\nTaniel could hear his heart thumping in his ears. His original plan,\ntenuous at best, relied on removing the sentries and then killing them all in\ntheir sleep. Brutal, but efficient.\nNow what could he do? They’d wake in the morning and find they’d\nbeen attacked. They would know they had found him, and what would his\nattack have accomplished? Nothing.\nHis steps became hurried and careless as he approached the second\nsentry from behind. A rock turned, the scree moved, and Taniel cursed out\nloud.\nThe man turned toward him, a question on his lips.\nTaniel sprinted forward and slammed a fist against the base of the"

Taniel snatched at the front of his uniform and caught his air\nrifle as it dropped. The man slumped to the ground.\nTaniel examined the man at his feet as the moon flashed briefly from\nbehind a cloud. The sentry’s features were soft, young, unworn by years on\ncampaign. He looked about eighteen. A recruit?\nHe picked up the soldier’s air rifle, running his hands over the length.\nIt had a long, smoothbore barrel not unlike a musket, with a firing\nmechanism where the flintlock would be and a rounded air canister instead\nof a stock. Terrible weapons to a powder mage, their expense and\nunreliability had kept them from becoming more common in the Kez army.\nTamas had banned them completely from Adro.\nTo break the mechanism on the weapon was no terrible difficulty. But\nTaniel needed to send a message.\nHe held his hand up to the night sky, looking at the moonlight through\nthe gaps in his fingers. He remembered killing those Adran soldiers – the\nDredgers. Remembered putting his hand into the man’s mouth after he\nspoke of raping Ka-poel and curling his fingers around his teeth, grasping\nand pulling. He remembered feeling the tendons of the man’s jaw snap as\nhe’d ripped his jawbone from his body.\nAnd all of that without the powder. Only his rage and Ka-poel’s\nstrange sorcery to spur him on.\nTaniel grasped the barrel of the air rifle in both hands and flexed.\nSlowly, the barrel gave way. He bent it all the way to a right angle, his\nmuscles screaming in protest at the force required.\nHe then snuck back up to the camp. He found a burlap sack and\ngathered all of the air canisters, then stripped the men of their rations and\nkits – he gathered a knife, a sword, and enough food to feed himself and\nKa-poel for over a month.\nHe left them all sleeping soundly in their bedrolls. They’d wake in the\nmorning – or when their sentries regained consciousness – to find\nthemselves robbed.\nAnd in the center of their camp, just beside the fire, a neat pile of\neleven air rifles, each of them bent into an L-shape.\nCHAPTER 7\nN\nila waited northwest of the Adran camp, her dress damp from the grass\nbeneath her. The stars above were hidden by a veil of clouds, and despite\nthe thousands of cook fires in the camp to the southeast and Bo’s warm\nbody by her side, she felt utterly alone in the wilderness.\nDuring the day she knew she would have seen the plains of southern\nAdopest stretching all the way to the mighty Black Tar Forest that skirted\nthe Charwood Pile Mountain Range to their west. To the east was the\nAdsea, and the Adran Mountains to the south that separated Adro and Kez.\nShe had once been told that they were called the Adran Mountains by\nAdro and the Kresim Mountains by Kez.

She rubbed her hands together to\nget them warm and wondered how these mountains were labeled in the\nmaps of those outside of Adro or Kez. The autumn chill was here and the\nleaves would fall from their trees any week now. All her clothes were in the\nluggage on top of their carriage where they’d left it in the Adran camp.\nAnd inside that was the corpse of an assassin with a melted face.\n“Are you still going to help Adamat find his son?” she asked. It\noccurred to her, just after she’d spoken, that if Bo was willing to lie to\nAdamat, he wouldn’t hesitate to hide the truth from her.\nBo shifted beside her. They had slipped out of the camp with little\ntrouble, some trick of Bo’s sorcery, stepping around soldiers and sentries as\nif they were invisible. He hadn’t said much since then.\n“I keep my word,” Bo said. The slight hesitation. The regret in his\nvoice. He didn’t want to.\n“You’re thinking you shouldn’t have brought Adamat and Oldrich\nalong in the first place,” Nila said quietly.\nBo snorted but said nothing.\n“Well?”\n“Of course I am. It proved nothing but a complication. Certainly it got\nus a meeting with Hilanska, but I only endangered their lives and made it\nharder for us to get anything done. On my own I could have slipped into the\ncamp, tortured a few key people for information, and gotten out again.”\nIt was odd the way Bo expressed regret over endangering the lives of\nthose men in one breath and spoke of torturing innocent soldiers in the next.\nIn Nila’s mind those two items were mutually exclusive, and yet she still\nthought of Bo as a good man. Was she wrong, or was it more complicated\nthan that?\nBo waved a hand dismissively, as if in response to something she\ndidn’t say. “He’s out of harm’s way by now.”\n“Can you be sure?”\n“The missing prisoners have certainly been discovered,” Bo said. “If\nHilanska wanted to make much ado about it, there would be search parties\ncombing these fields already. Perhaps riders going after Colonel Etan. No.\nHilanska will sweep it under the rug. Perhaps he doesn’t have the time or\nmanpower to organize a search.” Bo’s head tilted toward Nila and she\nthought she could make out the shadow of a smile on his face. “Perhaps the\nassassin with a melted head has discouraged pursuit.”\nNila cleared her throat. She didn’t want to talk about that. Pit, she\ndidn’t want to remember that. The feel of the man’s skull giving way\nbeneath her burning hand would give her nightmares for months. She\nshuddered. “What are we watching for out here?”\n“Spies,” he said.\nShe couldn’t help but scoff. “Spies? Out here? It’s pitch-black!”\n“Don’t look toward the fires of the camp. Even at this distance they\ncan damage your night vision.”\nShe had been doing just that, wishing she had someplace warm to\nsleep tonight. Her teeth began to chatter and she scooted a little closer to\nBo. “We’re out in the middle of nowhere. Why would a spy come up here?”"

    "text": "sleep tonight. Her teeth began to chatter and she scooted a little closer to\nBo. “We’re out in the middle of nowhere. Why would a spy come up here?”\n“To circle around the sentries,” Bo said. She could see the shadow of\nhis arm as he pointed. “Hilanska’s camp is down there. And over there,” he\nsaid, pointing due south, “about seven miles away is Ket’s camp. Beyond\nthem are the Kez. And up there” – he pointed to the northwest – “are the\nWings of Adom, a mercenary company in the employ of Adro.”\n“They’re keeping their distance while their employers are fighting\neach other?”\n“Exactly,” Bo said, sounding pleased. “Now, because of this schism in\nthe army Hilanska probably doesn’t trust his own men, so his spy won’t go\nthrough the pickets to the south but rather head north, pretending to be a\ncourier on his way to Adopest. He’ll leave the road a couple of miles north\nof the camp and cut across this direction, where he can go to either the Kez,\nthe Adran, or the mercenary camps to meet with his liaison.”\n“How can you possibly know that?”\nBo chuckled. “I grew up on the streets, and then in Field Marshal\nTamas’s household. I have an education in strategic deduction and guessing\nthat most Privileged never get. Now, stop asking questions. Open your third\neye.”\nMost everyone with magical ability could use their third eye to look\ninto the Else. It allowed them to see the mark that sorcery had made upon\nthe world and to see anyone else with magical ability. It had been the first\nthing Bo taught her: looking beyond that which was real to see the sorcery\nbeneath it.\nShe took a few shallow breaths and let her eyes fall halfway shut,\nfocusing on the muscles around her eyeballs. The process itself wasn’t all\nthat different from crossing one’s eyes. A wave of nausea flowed over her,\nnearly making her double over, but she forced herself to hold on, opening\nher eyes all the way to look into the Else.\nThe world she now saw was faint, as if she were viewing it through a\nthick veil. She could make out the landscape even in the darkness, but it\nwas as if it had been drawn carelessly in a series of pastel colors, like an\nartist’s sketch.\nShe turned toward the Adran camp, and for a moment it seemed as if\nthe number of campfires had doubled. The glow of Knacked in the Else.\nThe whole camp seemed almost a smudge.\n“I’m going to throw up,” she said.\nBo whispered in her ear, startling her. “Don’t give in to it. The nausea\nlessens with practice.”\n“Is this how we’re going to spot the spy in the dark?”\n“Yes.”\n“You think the spy will be a Privileged or a Knacked?”\n“Not a Privileged,” Bo said. “Likely a Knacked. Many spies are. It\ngives them an edge. And even if they weren’t, it wouldn’t matter.”\n“How so?”\n“Powder mages can’t see regular people in the Else. Neither can\nKnacked.”\n“But Privileged can?”\n“Yes. It’s very faint. If a Privileged is a bonfire and a Knacked is a"

If a Privileged is a bonfire and a Knacked is a\nlantern, then a regular person is a lightning bug. Their color in the Else will\nbe so faint that you might think you’re imagining it.”\nHolding her eyes on the Else was beginning to hurt. Her eyes felt dry\nand a headache had begun to form just behind her temples. “How can that\npossibly be of any use?”\n“It takes a sharp eye,” Bo said. “And practice.”\n“If this is practice, I don’t want to do it anymore.”\n“I’ve always hated practicing,” Bo said, his voice warm in her ear.\n“But that’s how you get to be better. That’s how you become smarter and\ntougher than the people who will want to harm you. And when you’re a\nPrivileged… that becomes everyone.”\nNila felt her insides shift uncomfortably. How could anyone keep this\nup for any length of time? The mere thought of it made her want to vomit.\n“You remember how much you hated Lord Vetas?”\nNila nearly lost her grasp of the Else. She didn’t trust herself to\nanswer.\n“You remember how he made you feel so helpless?” Bo whispered.\n“Take all that hate and anger and ball it up and put it away. Don’t chew on it\n– that just makes you bitter. Put it aside and use it as a reminder of why you\nnever want to be helpless again. Take your weakness and make it your\nstrength. You’ll be a powerful Privileged, Nila. Stronger than anyone I’ve\nknown. Stronger than me. But you have to work for it.”\nNila almost lost her focus again as she bit off a laugh. Powerful?\nStronger than Bo? That seemed ridiculous. “How strong are you?”\n“Reasonably so. I have my weaknesses, but I make up for them with\ncunning.”\n“That doesn’t seem honest.”\n“Lying and cheating are all fair game when your life is on the line.\nAnd it always is, in a royal cabal. I might have been cabal head someday.\nEspecially after I learned a number of… secrets.”\n“What kind of secrets?”\n“Ancient sorcery. Like folding the Else upon itself so that other\nPrivileged or Knacked can’t see me.”\n“Who taught you that?”\nThere was amusement in his voice. “A very old woman. She taught me\na lot of things that she probably shouldn’t have. It came back to bite her in\nthe end.” Bo paused. “There’s something else you should know about being\na Privileged.”\n“Just one thing?”\n“This is rather… personal.”\nNila’s heart skipped a beat. She had wondered when this would come\nup. “Oh?” She kept her third eye on the dark area north of the Adran camp,\nwatching for anything that could be movement, and said a prayer of thanks\nthat Bo couldn’t see her cheeks turning red.\n“You’ll have urges.”\n“What kinds of urges?” It was a stupid question.

It affects both men and women, although women have a\ntendency to control it better.”\n“And if I don’t?”\n“You will.”\n“Do you have any water?”\n“Here.” Bo put a canteen in her hands. “Drop your third eye. You don’t\nwant to pass out.”\nNila realized that her whole body was shaking from the effort of\nlooking into the Else. She closed her third eye and took the canteen\ngratefully. When she finished drinking, she turned to Bo. “Have you had\nmany women?”\n“A few.”\n“I’ve heard stories about Privileged…”\n“Most of them are probably true.” A pause. She could feel him\nwatching her. “Nila, if I catch a spy tonight or the night after, I’ll have to\ntorture him.”\nShe felt relief at the change of subject, but only for a moment. “Do you\nhave to?”\n“I need information.”\n“You can’t just magic the truth from him?”\n“I wish that were the case.”\n“There is no other choice?”\n“I’m not a good person. No Privileged is.”\nNila didn’t like the implication. “I’m supposed to become a\nPrivileged.”\n“You are a Privileged. Even if you’ve only just begun your training.”\n“And I have to do horrid things to survive in this world?”\n“You already have. And you will again.”\nShe remembered the sticky feeling of the blood between her fingers,\nand the way that assassin’s skull had melted beneath her hand as easily as\nwarm wax. “That’s the second time in as many minutes you’ve told me\nwhat I’ll end up doing. Do you know me so well, Privileged Borbador?”\nShe felt the feather touch of Bo’s gloved fingers on her cheek and then\nhe pulled away.\nThey sat in silence for some time, listening to the wind rush across the\nopen field. Somewhere nearby an owl hooted in the darkness. Bo stood up\nsuddenly and removed his jacket, putting it over Nila’s shoulders.\n“I’m fine,” she said.\n“I can hear your teeth chattering.”\nShe could see the white of his Privileged gloves standing out against\nthe black of the night as he walked down the hill. Struggling against the\nnausea, she opened her third eye. Was he touching the Else?\nThe color of his body in the Else nearly overwhelmed her with its\nbrightness. He spread his arms and she waited to see something more, but\nhe just stood there, his face in the wind.\n“Bo!” she hissed.\nHe came back up the hill toward her. “Hmm?”\n“I saw it! A movement.”\n“Where?”\n“To the southeast. Moving along the dip between hills. At least, I\nthought I saw it. Maybe —”\n“No.” Bo’s voice was grim, and she heard him crack his knuckles. “I\nsaw it too.

She looked toward the Adran camp, watching the distant\nembers of their fires, and wished once more she were in the safety and\nwarmth of her own bedroll.\nBo would say that there was no place safe for a Privileged.\nHad he told her to stay behind to spare her the horrors of watching him\ntorture some poor soul? Or because he thought she was weak?\nPerhaps both.\nShe was a Privileged, he’d told her. She couldn’t afford to be weak to\nsurvive in this world. With the power of sorcery came the expectations of\nothers. People would expect her to use her powers – for king or country or\nwealth. People would try to use her. She wondered if her own power would\ngive her hungers. Not just the sexual urgings Bo had spoken of but the\nhunger for riches, servants, and authority.\nThe fear of it niggled at her. What could she do? Flee to some distant\nland and hope that no one ever noticed her? Or learn to control her sorcery,\nembrace the power it brought her? She didn’t want to be an evil person, yet\nBo spoke of Privileged as if they had no choice. She felt as if there were a\nwar inside of her already and that it would determine the kind of person she\nwould be.\nBo, she realized, was in the throes of that very same war.\nNila climbed to her feet. Bo was cresting the next hill, moving farther\naway. She opened her third eye but could no longer spot the moving\nshadow of light in the Else. Bo was hidden as well, veiled in whatever trick\nhe’d spoken of earlier.\nShe closed her third eye and stumbled after him, feeling her way in the\ndark.\nShe caught up to him a quarter of a mile and a twisted ankle later,\nlimping up to where he crouched in the long grass. She could feel the\nintensity as he stared into the darkness like a cave lion stalking its prey.\nWithout turning his head, he whispered, “What is it?”\n“I should stay with you.”\nA hesitation. “Are you sure?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good. Whoever he is, he’s coming right at us. Don’t touch the Else –\nI’m going to trip him with earth and bind him with air, but my sorcery will\nbe obscured from any Knacked that might be watching. You don’t know\nhow to do any of that, so stay here until I have him.”\nNila hunkered down next to Bo, her knees wet from the grass. From\nthe way Bo was facing, she guessed that the spy was traveling in the gully\nbetween two hills. She couldn’t see a thing, however, and waited for Bo to\nmake his move.\nShe didn’t have to wait long. His arms suddenly came up, two shadows\nin the night, and she thought she saw a spark when his fingers danced.\nThere was a cry in the gully beneath them that was cut dramatically short,\nand Bo leapt to his feet. “Come on!” They stumbled down the hill and Bo\nthrew himself forward. “Hold still, damn it.

You’re not going anywhere.”\nSeveral muffled grunts followed and then the area was suddenly lit by the\nbeam of a dull light not unlike a bull’s-eye lantern. It originated from Bo’s\nshoulder and revealed Bo struggling with a small figure.\n“It’s only a boy!” Nila said before she could stop herself. Could they\nhave caught the wrong person? Just some innocent messenger, or maybe\neven a drummer boy who’d decided to run away from the camp?\nBo gave her a dirty look and flipped the boy onto his back. Hands and\nlegs bound by invisible sorcery, the boy thrashed on the ground like an\nearthbound fish. He couldn’t have been more than twelve, with a narrow\nnose and long brown hair tied back behind his head. He wore a plain black\nuniform with matching kneesocks, boots, and jacket.\nBo stood up, one finger pointed at the boy as if he were pinning a fly\nto the ground beneath him, and seemed content to let the boy tire himself\nout for several minutes.\nNila stepped up beside Bo. “He’s just a boy,” she whispered in his ear.\n“I know that.”\n“Are you going to torture him?”\n“If I must.”\n“You were a boy once too.”\n“And I had to learn when to grow up.”\nThe coldness in his words shocked her. “Let me at him first.”\nHe blinked at her several times before gesturing to the boy\nmagnanimously. “Be my guest.”\n“Give me an extra pair of gloves.”\nPulling on the gloves, she knelt next to the boy and held them up to\nBo’s light. “Do you know what these are?”\nThe boy nodded fearfully.\n“You’ve the unfortunate luck to fall into the hands of two Privileged.\nAnswer our questions truthfully and we’ll let you go. Lie to us, and we’ll\ntake turns scouring the flesh from your bones so that there is nothing left of\nyou but a charred shell come morning. I can make certain that no one will\nhear your screams.” She leaned in close to his face. “And no one will help\nyou. Do you understand?”\nThe boy’s mouth worked, but no sound came forth.\nNila glanced over her shoulder at Bo. “Sorry,” Bo muttered. One\nfinger twitched.\n“Let’s try that again,” Nila said. “Do you understand?”\n“Yes!” the boy gasped. “I do!”\n“Good. What is your name?”\n“Folkrot.”\n“Unfortunate name,” Bo muttered just loud enough for Nila to hear.\nShe compressed her lips in a hard line to stifle a laugh. “What are you\ndoing out here?”\n“I’ve run off from my unit.” The words had barely left his mouth when\nBo’s fingers twitched and Folkrot gave a terrified squeal. “I’m sorry! I\nmean, I’m delivering a message.”\nNila tried to keep her composure. Could Bo really sense if he was\nlying? Or was he testing the boy? “For whom?” she asked.\n“General Hilanska.”\n“Where were you taking it?”\n“To the Kez lines. I’m meant to be there by morning.”\n“And what kind of message are you delivering?”\n“I don’t know! It’s a sealed letter. I’m not allowed to open it.” Another"

I’m not allowed to open it.” Another\nsqueal, and Folkrot writhed from some unseen twisting of sorcery. “I swear\nto you it’s true!”\nNila slapped Bo’s leg and the boy instantly stopped moving. “Where is\nthe letter?”\n“Under my shirt.”\nNila bent forward and undid the front of the boy’s jacket, then lifted\nhis shirt. Strapped to his white belly just below his ribs was a leather\nsatchel. She removed it and handed it to Bo.\nBo stepped away from her and the boy and opened the letter. He stared\nat it for several minutes before beckoning Nila over.\n“It’s coded,” Bo said. “Damn it. It doesn’t help us.” He walked around\nin a circle for a moment before stopping. “The Wings of Adom employ\nseveral code breakers. They’ve fought in just about every country in the\nworld. Their camp isn’t far. We can get there by late morning if we walk all\nnight.”\nNila didn’t like the idea at all. She was already wet, tired, dirty, and\nshe’d twisted her ankle. A seven-mile walk in the dark sounded horrible.\n“And the boy?”\n“I have to kill him,” Bo said.\n“No!”\n“We have no choice. We can’t let him go. He’ll run back to Hilanska\nand tell him the letter was taken. I’ll make it quick.”\n“You bloody animal! I will not let you do that.”\n“And how will you stop me?” There was a challenge in Bo’s voice.\nNila felt her hands stiffen and thought of the blue flame that had\ndanced over her fingers. Who was she kidding? She couldn’t use sorcery\nagainst Bo. He would toss her aside like garbage. “He’s an innocent. I’ll\nmake you kill me first.”\nA sour look crossed Bo’s face and he looked from her to the boy as if\nconsidering how best to move her out of the way.\n“We can take him with us to the Wings’ camp and hand him over to\nthem,” Nila said. “We won’t have to kill him and he won’t be reporting to\nanyone.”\n“I don’t like having a tagalong.”\n“You let me bring Jakob.”\n“Not here, I didn’t. We left him with Adamat’s family so he wouldn’t\nbe a burden.”\n“And we’ll only have this boy until we reach the Wings’ camp. Do you\nwant more blood on your hands?”\nBo stared at his gloves for a moment before giving a curt nod. “Bring\nhim. But we lose him at the Wings’ camp.”\nCHAPTER 8\nI\nt was around seven o’clock in the morning, the tall grass still bathed in\ndew, when Adamat, Oldrich, and their fifteen soldiers trekked into the\nWings of Adom mercenary camp.\nThe mercenaries were camped around a town called Billishire, not\nmore than thirty miles from the edge of the Black Tar Forest.

He went straight for the first\nsentry he saw and came up short, letting the man eye him suspiciously for\nseveral moments before speaking.\n“Inspector Adamat here to see Brigadier Abrax,” he said.\nThe sentry was a middle-aged man with a fixed bayonet. His red-and-\nwhite uniform was clean and pressed, and the gold trim glittered in the early\nlight.\n“I’ve no orders regarding you,” the sentry said. He eyed the small\ntroop of soldiers and their trail through the grass that led off into the\ndistance as if not quite sure what to make of them.\n“I’m here on behalf of Field Marshal Tamas.”\nThe sentry’s skepticism deepened. “The field marshal is dead.”\n“Is he now?” Adamat asked, giving the man his very best deadpan\nexpression of annoyance. He imagined that it looked like a tired squint.\n“We’ve walked all night and I have urgent news for the brigadier. I have a\nletter of introduction from Colonel Etan of the Twelfth Grenadiers of the\nAdran army.”\nThe sentry regarded Adamat another moment before looking over\nOldrich and his men. The soldiers had shed their grenadier disguises but\nkept the rifles, and despite not having slept for twenty-four hours, they\nlooked sharp enough to play the part.\n“I better escort you in, then,” the sentry said.\nFor the second time in as many days, Adamat was led into the heart of\na military camp. They were handed off to another sentry, and then to a\nmajor’s adjutant – a young woman with blond hair and an easy smile – who\ntook them to the church that Adamat had spotted earlier in the center of the\ntown.\nThe camp was just beginning to stir, cookpots going over the fires and\ncamp laundresses finishing their night’s work. The stillness gradually gave\nway to the bustle of camp life as the men crawled from their beds.\nAdamat caught the sleeve of the adjutant just before they reached the\nchurch. “I’m the only one who needs to see the brigadier,” he said. “Is there\nany chance you could show some hospitality to my escort?”\nThe adjutant gave a quick nod and beckoned to Oldrich. “Take your\nmen over to the Willow Inn, just past that house there. It serves as the\nofficers’ mess in the evenings, but they’ll be happy to give you breakfast.\nTell them that Brigadier Abrax will cover the tab.”\n“My thanks,” Adamat said once the soldiers had gone off in search of\nthe inn.\n“Of course,” the adjutant said. “We show the same hospitality our\nbrothers-in-arms have shown us. And Field Marshal Tamas has been good\nto us.”\nAdamat wondered how, exactly, Tamas had been paying the Wings of\nAdom. The newspapers had whispered of bankruptcy in the capital for\nmonths.\nInside the church, Adamat was shown to one of the pews, and the"

    "text": "Adom. The newspapers had whispered of bankruptcy in the capital for\nmonths.\nInside the church, Adamat was shown to one of the pews, and the\nadjutant disappeared. He sat quietly with his hands in his lap, examining the\nstained-glass windows behind the pulpit. The largest window depicted\nKresimir floating high above South Pike Mountain, his arms spread over\nthe whole of the Nine. His brothers and sisters gathered at his feet, helping\nhim in the formation of the Nine Nations. Adamat wondered how being at\nwar with Kresimir himself would change the Kresim religion in Adro.\n“Inspector?”\nThe voice brought Adamat out of an uneasy sleep, and he realized he’d\nbeen leaning his head on the pew in front of him. He rubbed vigorously at\nhis forehead to remove the red line it likely caused and got to his feet.\n“Yes?”\n“The brigadier has just begun her breakfast. She’s asked you to join\nher.”\nThe idea of breakfast nearly made Adamat faint. He’d been so\nincredibly sore and sleep-deprived all night that he hadn’t thought of food,\nbut the very mention of it made his stomach growl as loud as a cave lion.\nHe was taken across the street to what would have probably been the\npriest’s house, a two-story building with a brick façade and green shutters,\nand he was shown into the dining room.\nAdamat was surprised to see a familiar face sitting at the head of the\ntable: Lady Winceslav, the owner of the Wings of Adom. She wore the\nwhite uniform with gold sash of a Wings brigadier – a formality, if Adamat\nwere to guess. She didn’t have experience of command.\nBrigadier Abrax sat at the foot of the table, also wearing white and\ngold. She stood when Adamat entered. “Inspector.” She regarded him\nblandly, her stern face unreadable.\n“Brigadier,” Adamat said, shaking her hand. “And my lady, I didn’t\nrealize you were here.” This could complicate things. Abrax had a\nreputation for severity, but Adamat still hoped to cajole her into helping\nhim. Lady Winceslav would stand for no such cajoling.\n“Inspector, I’m told that you have word of Tamas.” Winceslav raised a\ncup of tea to her lips.\nAdamat swallowed, noting that he had not been asked to sit. “I’m\nsorry, my lady, but I do not.”\nWinceslav’s face fell. “The adjutant said that you had implied as\nmuch.”\n“I didn’t mean to mislead,” Adamat said. “I simply said I was here on\nbehalf of Field Marshal Tamas.”\n“I see.” Another sip of tea. Still no invitation to sit. “And what orders\nhas the late field marshal given that you still feel pressed to follow\nthrough?”\nAdamat filed through his memory, looking for an order, whether\nspoken or written, that Tamas had given before his disappearance into Kez.\n“Well, none, my lady.”\nWinceslav gave a slight sigh. Abrax narrowed her eyes at him. Both\nremained silent.\n“My lady, I…”\n“The last time we met,” Winceslav said, “you were investigating me\nfor treachery.

I understand you were following orders, but it doesn’t leave\nus on the best of terms. I hope you have something good to say.”\nLady Winceslav wouldn’t be fooled by any stories that Adamat could\nspin, and he likely wasn’t going to appeal to her patriotism – she was\nalready doing what she could for her country. What else would work?\nAdamat decided on an appeal to her pragmatism. “I arrived in the\nAdran camp yesterday morning with Privileged Borbador and a squad of\nTamas’s Riflejacks with the intent of arresting General Ket on charges of\nwar profiteering and releasing Taniel Two-shot from imprisonment.”\n“Two-shot disappeared weeks ago,” Abrax said. “Surely you’d been\ninformed.” She said nothing about the charges against Ket. She didn’t even\nraise her eyebrow.\n“We knew he was accused of murdering several of Ket’s men in self-\ndefense. Nothing after that. Until yesterday, of course. General Hilanska\nfilled us in on the schism in the army, and Taniel’s capture and death at the\nhands of the Kez.” Adamat had, not for the first time, the uneasy feeling\nthat the lack of news in the capital was not accidental. It was something\nhe’d have to consider more in the future.\nWinceslav’s teacup clinked onto her plate. “Did you say Privileged\nBorbador?”\n“Yes, my lady.”\n“Where is he now?”\n“We were separated just before leaving the Adran army.” No need to\ntell her the specifics about that. It would only complicate matters.\n“Two-shot isn’t dead,” Abrax said.\n“Oh?”\n“At least,” Abrax continued, “no one’s seen the body. Before the…\nevent… between Kresimir and Mihali, Taniel was seen carving his way\nthrough the Kez army with that savage sorceress of his. My Privileged told\nme that there was some very interesting sorcery going on.”\nBo would certainly be delighted by that news. But how to get it to\nhim? As far as he knew, the Privileged was in the Kez camp right now – or\nhad been captured and killed by Hilanska. Adamat tried to bring his\nthoughts back on track. This wasn’t about Two-shot anymore.\n“That’s all very interesting,” Winceslav said. She took a bite of a\nbiscuit and chewed and swallowed before going on. “But that doesn’t tell us\nwhat you’re here for.”\nAdamat’s mouth watered. “My lady, I saw Hilanska’s battle plans\nwhen I met with him. I have reason to believe he will attack Ket within the\nnext couple of days. And I don’t think he has any intention of trying to\nresolve the conflict diplomatically. If the two of them fight, the Kez will\nonly have to sit back and wait until they’ve destroyed each other and this\nwhole campaign will be in ruins.”\n“And you have a solution to that?” Abrax asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Well?”\n“I want you to draft all three of Ket’s brigades into the Wings of Adom\nmercenary company.”\nAbrax barked out a laugh. “Absurd.”"

The logistics would be impossible,” Abrax said.\n“Not impossible. Just inconvenient.”\n“And,” Abrax added, “Ket will have to agree.”\n“She will. I know exactly what she wants.”\nAbrax opened her mouth, but Winceslav’s raised hand kept her silent.\n“Inspector,” Winceslav said. There was a note of interest in her voice.\n“Please sit down and have breakfast with us. I’m interested in hearing\nmore.”\nCHAPTER 9\nT\naniel climbed the mountainside, finding a spot several hundred feet\nabove the camp, and settled in to watch the sleeping soldiers until morning.\nIt was still dark, not long after he’d left the camp, when one of the\nsoldiers climbed from his bedroll and stumbled into the bushes. He returned\na minute later and his sudden shouting told Taniel that he had discovered\nthe artwork Taniel had made out of the squad’s air rifles. The rest of the\ninfantry were up in seconds.\nThey were in a panic. Even from this distance Taniel could hear their\nhoarse arguments, the curses, and then a call of dismay when they found the\nfirst unconscious sentry.\nIt took them another fifteen minutes before a figure – probably their\nsergeant – made his way to the top of the waterfall and found the second\nsentry. They carried her down to the group and then huddled in conference,\ntheir backs to the cliffside in a defensive perimeter despite their lack of\nweapons.\nThe eastern sky was just getting light when they broke camp. Tired,\ntheir fright apparent from their body language, they made their way\ncautiously back down the valley. Taniel waited until he could continue his\nclimb without the risk of being spotted, and then started the long journey\nback to Ka-poel.\nHe ducked inside the cave two hours later. His legs ached from the\nclimb and his body sagged with exhaustion. Three times he had lost his\nfooting, nearly falling down the steep side of the valley. His fingers were\nbleeding from the climb and his trousers and shirt resembled a beggar’s\nfilthy rags.\nHis heart leapt into his throat at the sight of Ka-poel. She was curled\nup in one corner of the cave, his jacket draped over her, using her hands as a\npillow. Taniel skirted the facsimile of Kresimir and knelt beside her.\n“Pole,” he said, gently touching her shoulder.\nSomething pressed against his throat. He inhaled sharply and looked\ndown his nose at the long needle clutched in Ka-poel’s hand.\n“It’s me, Pole.”\nOne green eye regarded him for a moment and then the needle was\nwithdrawn. She sat up, shaking the sleep from her head.\n“Kresimir,” Taniel said urgently. “What has happened with Kresimir?”\nShe cocked an eyebrow at him for a moment and then her face lit up.\nShe pointed at the doll of Kresimir, which was bound in the center of the"

She walked her fingers through the air and then chopped the other\nhand viciously.\nTaniel snorted. “He’s not going anywhere?”\nKa-poel nodded, a victorious smile on her lips.\n“How?”\nShe tapped the side of her head, then pointed at the doll again.\nFor the first time, Taniel noticed the symbols written in the dust around\nthe doll: a series of vague lines pointing away from Kresimir. They made\nlittle sense to him. “What do those mean?”\nShe made a fist and pointed.\n“I don’t —” He stopped and frowned. Then he saw it. They weren’t\nsymbols, but fingers. Kresimir lay in the palm of a hand – her hand, if\nTaniel wasn’t mistaken. “He’s in the palm of your hand. You don’t have to\nbe awake to keep him under control?”\nA nod.\n“How the pit did you figure that out?”\nKa-poel rolled her eyes as if looking into one corner of the cave and\nmade a vague gesture.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\nBoth of her eyebrows rose and she gave him the flat look she always\nused when she was pretending not to understand him. He snatched her by\nthe arm. “Pole, what the pit is that supposed to mean?” He couldn’t help the\nurgency in his voice. How did she know that Kresimir was still under\ncontrol? How did she know what symbols held power?\nShe shrugged, then drew in the dust with one finger and spread the\nother hand out toward Kresimir’s doll.\n“You were experimenting?”\nA nod.\n“With a god?”\nShe gave him a sheepish grin. Whatever sleep she’d managed while he\nwas away had done her a world of good. The lines under her eyes had\ndiminished. Her spirits seemed up. She hadn’t smiled in a week.\nTaniel released his grip on her arm and ran a hand through his knotted,\ndirty hair. Several pine needles came away and he tossed them in the corner\nof the cave.\n“How can you possibly know what might or might not work? Pit, I\nwish I understood something – anything – about your sorcery.”\nShe pointed to herself. Me too.\n“You don’t know anything about your own sorcery?”\nShe gave him a half shrug, then held up five fingers. She drew in the\ndust for a moment, then pulled a finger across her throat.\n“I didn’t catch any of that, Pole.”\nShe snorted angrily.\n“Be careful experimenting with sorcery, Pole,” Taniel said. “I’ve heard\nof a few Privileged and powder mages teaching themselves the rudiments.\nBut untrained adepts who try to go further just get themselves killed. They\nburn themselves to a crisp with the Else or blow themselves up or get\npowder blindness or… pit, I don’t know how your sorcery could kick back\nat you, but it will happen.” He rubbed his eyes. “You’re bloody well\ncontrolling a god. I’m not sure how you haven’t been strangled with your\nown powers yet.”\nShe made a gesture and a consoling smile. Me neither.\nJust great."

Me neither.\nJust great.\nTaniel fetched the rations he’d stolen from the Adran soldiers. He and\nKa-poel set upon them hungrily. The biscuits were hard and salty, the dried\nbeef as stringy as catgut, but he’d never tasted anything quite this good. He\nwent through two meals’ worth before he forced himself to stop eating.\nHe’d get cramps something fierce, and…\nThe taste of hard cheese brought back a memory that he’d wished to\nforget: Kresimir standing victoriously over where Adom – Mihali – had\nonce stood. These soldiers were only eating marching rations because\nMihali was dead. Taniel kicked the pack of rations away from him, feeling\nsuddenly ill. To his great surprise, he felt a tear roll down his cheek.\nHe quickly brushed it away.\nKa-poel took him by the arm and forced him to lie on the cold of the\ncave floor, his head in her lap, then began gently rubbing his temples. He\nstretched out, careful not to touch Kresimir’s doll, and felt the pain begin to\nbleed out of his legs and arms and his mind begin to drift.\nHe started awake, opening his eyes to find his head still in Ka-poel’s\nlap, her soft hand pressed to his cheek. The cave was well lit by the sun,\ntelling him it was just past noon.\nTaniel stifled a yawn and told himself to get up. He needed to be back\nout there, watching for more Adran squads, but Ka-poel was warm, and\ndespite the cold of the cave floor he felt as if he had been sitting in a hot\nbath for hours.\n“I have to… Pole, is that blood on your finger?”\nThe tip of Pole’s finger was smeared with crimson. She pressed it to\nher lips and looked down at him for a moment, her thoughts elsewhere. She\nthen pressed the finger to his right cheek. He reached up to stop her, but her\nother hand took his in a surprisingly strong grip and she ministered to first\none cheek, then the other. He could feel the blood drying on his face.\nShe licked the blood off her finger and more welled up in its place. It\nwas her blood, then. What was she doing? Was this sorcery? Some kind of\nsavage ritual?\nHe pushed her away and got to his feet, feeling strange. “Pole, what\nare you doing?” He wiped one sleeve across his cheek and looked at it.\nNothing. Very strange.\nFurther questions were met with a yawn.\nTaniel left Ka-poel passively regarding the doll of Kresimir. He headed\nout of the cave and climbed to the apex of the mountain, where he followed\nthe ridgeline.\nThe canyon down to his right was where he had ambushed the squad\nof Adran infantry.

The ridge began to\nnarrow dangerously, giving him fewer places to hide, but he continued on\nuntil he reached a sharp, flat slab of rock beyond which the sky stretched\nout like the serene surface of a mountain lake. He crawled to the edge of the\nrock on his hands and knees and peered over the edge.\nVeridi Valley was a jagged rend between two tall, gray-capped\nmountains. The floor of the valley had to be at least a thousand feet beneath\nhim. A river less than twenty feet across trickled down the middle, and\ntough mountain brush bristled along the valley floor. The canyon where\nhe’d ambushed the Adran soldiers let out into the Veridi Valley to Taniel’s\nwest. The valley, in turn, let out into another, and that led twenty miles or\nmore to the plains of Adro.\nOn the valley floor were the dots of at least a hundred tents: a\ncompany of Adran soldiers. Taniel had little doubt now that they had been\nsent by Hilanska – and he guessed that every one of them had an air rifle.\nWhere had they gotten the air rifles? From Kez?\nDid these men know that they were betraying their country?\nMovement caught Taniel’s eye. A small group emerged from the\ncanyon and made their way toward the Adran camp. Taniel shifted to get\ncomfortable and cursed his poor eyesight. In a powder trance he’d be able\nto see the very expressions on their faces. With his normal sight, he could\nbarely count their number.\nThis was the moment of truth. Would his act of clemency convince\nthem to turn around? Would they realize they’d been duped by their\ncommander into tracking down an ally? Would they be frightened by\nTaniel’s show of strength?\nHe waited for hours, squinting to see the movement in the camp, not\neven able to venture a guess as to their plans. No doubt the squad would\ngive their report and the officers would convene. The company major would\nlisten to advice from his captains and make a decision.\nSolitary figures began to leave the camp. Taniel tracked their\nmovement as they headed toward the various crags and valleys up and\ndown the canyon floor.\nThey were recalling the other search parties.\nInside the camp, men fell into ranks. Taniel’s heart fell as he watched\nthem. Dozens and dozens fell in with their kits at their hips and their air\nrifles on their shoulders. Bayonets flashed in the sunlight.\nThey weren’t breaking camp.\nA group of between eighty and a hundred – it was hard to tell at this\ndistance – left the camp at a slow march. They were heading deliberately\ntoward Taniel’s canyon.\nNo mistaking their intentions now.\nTaniel had begun to prepare for this eventuality from the time he’d first laid\neyes on the company trudging their way up the Veridi Valley.\nThey would proceed slowly, no doubt, but the strength of numbers\nwould give them confidence and they would move faster than the previous\nsearchers. A regular march, with scouts and sentries at all times, would take\nthe group no more than thirty or forty hours to reach the apex of the canyon"

A regular march, with scouts and sentries at all times, would take\nthe group no more than thirty or forty hours to reach the apex of the canyon\nand from there they would find Ka-poel’s cave within hours.\nTaniel considered the lay of the canyon, picturing it in his mind. There\nwere three choke points where a single man could hold against an entire\narmy. There were five spots steep and rubble-strewn enough that he could\nstart a rockslide. There were over a dozen prime sniping locations.\nBut they’d just shoot him in a choke point, the rockslide would give\naway his position, and he didn’t have a rifle.\n“Ka-poel,” he said, swinging himself into their cave. “We have to go.”\nShe crouched above the doll of Kresimir, her eyes unfathomable as a\ncat’s and a frown on her face. She shook her head slightly.\n“They’re coming for us,” he said. “About eighty infantry, all armed\nwith air rifles. We have two days before they find us here – if we’re lucky.\nThere’s no way I could possibly fight that many.”\nKa-poel shook her head again emphatically.\n“What do you mean, ‘no’?”\nShe pointed at the doll, then walked her fingers through the air. He\ncan’t be moved.\n“We have to move him. If we stay here, we die.”\nKa-poel stared at the doll for several moments and then rocked back\non her haunches, brow furrowed. She scratched in the dirt with the tip of\none of her long needles. She cupped her hand and tapped her palm with one\nfinger, as if indicating a pocket watch.\nI need time.\n“All right, Pole,” Taniel said. “But if they get close enough to turn this\ninto a real chase, neither of us will survive it.”\nCHAPTER 10\nN\nila guessed it to be around ten o’clock when they came within view of\nthe mercenary camp. Their prisoner, Folkrot, walked along ahead of them,\nlooking tired and dejected.\nHe’d tried to escape three times in the middle of the night, making a\nrun to the south. Each time, Nila had chased after him and tackled him to\nthe ground. On the third time Bo caught him with sorcery and all fight went\nout of the boy.\nNila’s feet hurt, her dress was filthy, and she wanted nothing more than\na warm bed. Bo showed a dark shadow on his cheeks from not shaving but\nseemed otherwise unaffected by the lack of sleep.\nThe sentry was a young woman in the red-and-white uniform of a\nWings soldier. She held a rifle on her shoulder and stood in the middle of\nthe road to block traffic – of which there was none – and seemed rather\nbored. She watched them go past without comment.\n“Shouldn’t she question us?” Nila asked.\n“She’s there to watch for the enemy,” Bo said. “Soldiers, cavalry. That\nkind of thing. The next one will ask us our business.”\n“Oh.”\n“Do you want to know why?”\n“I suppose?”\n“Always ask why. It’s not enough to know the what of something. A\nPrivileged always needs to know the why. It helps you learn how things"

It helps you learn how things\nwork, which aids in your manipulation of the Else.”\n“All right,” Nila said. “Then why?”\n“Because the next sentry is a Privileged.”\nFour mercenary soldiers stood on one side of the road and as Nila and\nBo approached, three of them lowered their rifles, bayonets bristling.\n“That’s far enough,” the fourth one said. An older woman, she stood\noff to one side of the others and held her hands out in front of her so they\ncould clearly see the gloves on her hands. “I know what you are, boy.\nExplain your presence here immediately.”\nBo leaned over to Nila. “The Wings employ several dozen low-\nstrength Privileged. They’re good for intimidation, and some of them have\nskill, but few if any have the strength of a cabal sorcerer. There’s a kind of\npecking order among Privileged. If I had more time, I might strut and scoff,\nbut now…” He held up both hands ungloved. “I’m here to see Brigadier\nAbrax,” he told the woman.\nAt the sight of the Privileged, Folkrot had backed away until he\nbumped into Nila. He turned, panic in his eyes, and would have fled had\nNila not snatched him by the collar.\n“On what business?”\n“My own,” Bo said.\nThe four sentries conversed among themselves.\n“Don’t open your third eye,” Bo whispered. “She’ll sense it.”\n“Can’t she see me in the Else?”\n“No. You haven’t interacted enough with it yet to have an aura. A few\nmonths, maybe as much as a year, and you will.”\nNila had been about to open her third eye. She wanted to see what\nanother Privileged – other than Bo – would look like. Even without doing\nso, she thought she could feel… something different about the woman.\nPerhaps she was imagining it.\n“Surrender your gloves,” the Wings Privileged finally said. “And\nsubmit to a search. Then we’ll take you into the camp. Brigadier Abrax isn’t\nhere, but you can ask for a meeting with Lady Winceslav.”\nBo’s face immediately lit up. “The Lady is here? Wonderful!”\nHe submitted to the search with far less annoyance than Nila would\nhave expected, and even handed over all three pairs of his gloves without\ncomment. One of the sentries turned to Nila.\n“I’m unarmed,” Nila said when he raised his hands.\n“I should anyway, ma’am.”\nNila squared her jaw and bit her tongue as the man patted his hands\ndown her sides and in the small of her back. When he reached between her\nlegs, she let fly without hesitation, slapping him full across the face.\nThe soldier stumbled backward. “Bloody pit!”\nBo’s eyes glinted dangerously, and Nila saw him tense.\nThe mercenary Privileged let out a laugh. “Oh, that’s grand.

Let’s take them in.”\nThey were escorted to the church in the center of the town by two\nrifle-armed soldiers. Just outside the building, a secretary was called over.\n“Where is Lady Winceslav?” Bo asked.\nThe secretary’s eyes flicked to the house just down the lane. “The\nLady is unavailable right now. I can ask if she has an appointment…”\nBo pushed past the secretary. “No need!” He was off down the lane\nwithout another word.\n“Hey!” One of their escorts took off after Bo. Nila put out a foot,\nhooking his boot, and the man sprawled into the mud. She immediately\ngrabbed him by the arm.\n“I am so sorry! That was awfully clumsy of me.”\nThe other escort cursed under his breath and rushed off, but Bo was\nalready disappearing inside the front door of the house the secretary had\nglanced at. Nila left the first soldier in the mud and followed Bo inside,\ndragging Folkrot along with her.\nBo was just coming out of the dining room when Nila arrived, their\nangry escort brandishing his rifle in Bo’s face.\n“Put that away,” Bo said peevishly, shoving the rifle out of his face.\n“My lady! My lady!”\nThe soldier shoved the stock of his rifle against Bo’s chest. “Outside!\nNow! Don’t make me —”\n“Make you do what?” Bo flipped the cuffs of his jacket inside out and\nslid his hands smoothly into the pair of gloves hidden within. He touched a\nfinger to the soldier’s throat and all color drained from the man’s face.\n“What is all this damned racket?” An old woman wearing a white\nsoldier’s uniform with a golden sash came out of the sitting room. She\nstopped at the sight before her. “Privileged Borbador?”\nBo spun away from the soldier and slipped his gloves off and into his\npockets. “My lady!”\n“Bo!”\nNila could feel her mouth hanging open as the two embraced like old\nfriends and kissed each other on the cheek.\nThe old woman – Lady Winceslav, Nila could only imagine – stepped\naway and looked Bo up and down. “Privileged Borbador, you’ve certainly\ngrown.”\n“And you’re looking more beautiful than ever.” Bo turned the full\nforce of his boyish grin on Winceslav.\nLady Winceslav shooed off their escort and the flustered secretary who\nhad caught up with them. “Come and sit with me! I’ll get us some tea. I’m\nso glad to see you alive. Tamas had assured me that you had not been\nincluded in his purges, but I was worried nonetheless.”\n“I very nearly was anyway,” Bo said. “But I made it through. Lady,\nthis is my new protégée, Nila. Nila, Lady Winceslav; owner of the Wings of\nAdom mercenary company and one of the finest people you will ever\nmeet.”\nThe Lady offered Nila her hand, which Nila kissed. “My pleasure,” she\nsaid.\n“Oh, she is a pretty one,” Winceslav said. Nila could have sworn the\nold woman winked at Bo. She felt her cheeks grow red. “And who is the\nboy?” Winceslav asked."

He snagged the secretary by the sleeve just as she\nwas leaving. “Put the boy in your stocks for two days, then let him go. Feed\nhim well and give him a fiver when he leaves.”\nBewildered, the secretary led Folkrot away.\n“I’m sorry to cut the pleasantries short,” Bo said as they took their\nseats in the sitting room, “but you should call one of your code breakers\nright away.” He produced the letter he had taken from Folkrot and tossed it\non the table.\n“And what is that?”\n“A missive,” Bo said. “From General Hilanska to the field marshal of\nthe Kez army.”\nThe Lady sent for one of her code breakers before returning to her\nseat. “And how did you come about such a missive? Surely you shouldn’t\nbe interrupting lines of communication between Hilanska and the Kez.\nThey might be negotiating a peace treaty.”\nNila spoke up. “We took it from that boy at about two o’clock this\nmorning. I somehow doubt, my lady, that he was negotiating a peace treaty\nat that hour.”\n“Is this true?” Winceslav asked Bo.\n“Yes.”\nWinceslav shook her head and leaned back in her chair. She suddenly\nlooked older. “Everything has gone to pit since Tamas disappeared. He was\nthe one thing holding this all together, and…”\n“If it makes you feel any better,” Bo said, “I don’t think Tamas is\ndead.”\n“That’s awfully optimistic. He was caught with just two brigades\nbehind enemy lines, in enemy territory. I’m no strategist, but the chances of\nhim returning are close to nothing.”\nBo’s eyebrows danced mischievously, but he said nothing more on the\nmatter, instead asking after Winceslav’s health and children. They went on\nlike old friends, and Nila felt infinitely out of her depth.\nHow did Bo know this woman? Through Tamas, no doubt, but they\nweren’t acting like mere acquaintances. Bo clearly trusted her implicitly –\nnot something the Privileged was wont to do. Nila knew by now that Bo\nflirted with everybody, so his grinning and compliments were no surprise,\nbut Winceslav was acting a bit like a schoolgirl around him. Had he… had\nhe slept with her?\n“Something wrong?”\nIt took Nila a moment to realize Bo was talking to her. “Hmm?”\n“Your cheeks are red.”\nShe fanned herself with a hand. “Just thinking about all the\nexcitement.”\nBo gave a chuckle and a knowing smile. Pit! It was like he knew\nexactly what she was thinking.\nIt wasn’t long before the code breaker arrived with a satchel of papers\nunder one arm. Bo directed him to the letter and continued his conversation\nwith Lady Winceslav.

He leafed through several dozen papers, stopping\nperiodically to lay one flat next to the missive, only to return it a moment\nlater. He finally seemed satisfied with one of them, leaving it next to the\nletter and then producing a clean sheet of paper and smoothing it out with\none hand. “I have a match, ma’am,” he said, interrupting Bo. “A lesser-used\ncode, but we have it in our records.”\n“Go ahead,” Lady Winceslav said. “Go on, Bo.”\n“I was saying it’s the curse of war, isn’t it? Weeks or even months of\nwaiting for something – anything – to happen. Almost makes you beg for a\nbattle.”\n“It’s terribly boring,” Winceslav agreed, “although I wouldn’t beg for a\nbattle. I came down here as soon as I heard about the schism in the army. I\nwas just told this morning that no one in Adopest even knows what’s going\non!” She shook her head. “I can’t possibly believe that.”\n“It’s true,” Bo said. “May I ask who told you that?”\n“A man by the name of Inspector Adamat.”\nNila turned away from watching the code breaker. “Adamat was\nhere?”\n“He was. He mentioned something about you, Bo, but I’m still\nsurprised to see you here.”\n“We…” Nila started.\n“My lady!” The codebreaker had stood up, his copy of the letter in his\ntrembling hands. “I’ve finished, my lady. This is urgent.”\n“Well, go on!”\nThe code breaker licked his lips. “Hilanska is plotting with the Kez,\nmy lady. He intends to destroy Ket’s brigades and then turn on us, working\njointly with the enemy.”\n“Give me that.” Bo snatched the translated missive from the code\nbreaker and ran his eyes over it. His face grew grim and he handed the letter\nover to Lady Winceslav.\nThe Lady was already on her feet. “I’ve just sent Abrax and two\ncompanies of my men to treat with General Ket. I’ve sent them to their own\nend.” She paled slightly and then straightened, standing tall. “Send for my\ncolonels. Mobilize the men. We march within the hour!”\nThe code breaker seemed startled by this. “Whom do you want to\nmarch, my lady?”\nWinceslav made two fists and gritted her teeth. “Everyone.”\nNila put her hand up on the side of Lady Winceslav’s coach to keep her\nhead from hitting the walls as they careened along the road together with\nwell over twenty thousand marching soldiers of the Wings of Adom.\nLady Winceslav gazed intently out the window as they traveled, while\nBo had become withdrawn almost as soon as the Lady had given the order\nto muster her troops. There had been no conversation in the coach for two\nhours already, and Nila wondered how long until they would reach General\nKet’s camp.\n“Do we expect fighting?” Nila asked, if only to break the silence.\nBo glanced toward her for a moment but didn’t speak.

Lady Winceslav\ngave her a smile that was only slightly patronizing. “It certainly seems that\nway,” she said.\n“Your soldiers mustered quickly,” Nila said. “I don’t have a lot of\nexperience with armies, but I’d thought it took them longer to get on the\nmarch.” She had been impressed by their speed. Lady Winceslav had given\nthe order and the first companies were leaving camp less than fifteen\nminutes later.\n“The company has spent a lot of time in Gurla,” Lady Winceslav said.\n“Gurlish nomads have a penchant for appearing out of the desert at a\nmoment’s notice to harass the camp. The men learn to fall in quickly, or die\nwith their boots off.” She fell silent and went back to staring out the\nwindow.\n“Bo,” Nila asked, desperate for a distraction from waiting to arrive,\n“when are you going to teach me about the elements?”\n“When you’re ready,” Bo said. “Have you been practicing looking into\nthe Else?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good.”\n“You can’t just give me a basic lesson?”\nBo turned toward her, mumbling something under his breath, then lay\nhis hand out flat in his lap and said, “Pay attention. A Privileged\nmanipulates five different elements within the Else; air, water, fire, earth,\nand aether. Your main hand” – he wiggled his fingers – “can be used to\nsummon those elements from the Else into our world. Your off-hand is used\nto direct them.”\n“If I lose a hand,” Nila asked, “do I lose all access to sorcery?”\n“The Else can be manipulated fully with just one hand, or your off-\nhand, it’s just much harder. Now, each of your fingers corresponds to one of\nthe elements and determines how strong you are in each element, starting\nwith your forefinger for the strongest, and ending with your thumb as the\nweakest. Do you follow?”\nNila nodded. This was simple enough so far. “How do I know what\nI’m strongest in?”\n“Trial and error. There’s no clear way of testing it without having you\nrub your fingers together all day and pointing your hands at things.\nConsidering the power I sense in you, that’s not a terribly good idea in any\npopulation centers. We’re going to have to figure it out slowly.”\n“Oh.” Nila felt a little disappointed. She wanted to know what she\ncould do now.\n“I can tell you,” Bo continued, “that you’re strongest in fire and\nweakest in aether.”\n“And how do you know that?”\n“When you make a fist, and the fire spreads up your arm, it happens\nbecause you’ve touched the Else and brushed your thumb and forefinger\ntogether. You haven’t used air to carry the flame anywhere or water to make\nit behave like liquid fire or your off-hand to direct the elements and so it\nclings to you like a scared kitten.” He smiled at his own analogy.\nFire. She was strongest in flame. She felt a little thrill go up her spine\nat the thought. “I understand the fire, but what about the aether?

Aether is\nused to create and destroy bonds between objects and elements, so think of\nit as an ignition source. It’s the spark that starts your sorcery. Thumb to\nforefinger to begin fire and then moving on down the spectrum.”\nNila moved her fingers experimentally, being sure not to let them\ntouch. She examined her middle finger, wondering what power it held.\n“You said almost everyone is weakest in aether?”\n“Yes. With some exceptions. The ones who are stronger tend to be\nhealers, as they can knit the bonds between flesh, bone – even blood vessels\nand brain matter.”\n“I could never be a healer?” It had been a hope Nila had held on to,\ndespite knowing how rare healers were. After all, being a healer meant she\ncould help people instead of killing them.\nBo gave a shrug. “You can develop some basic skill in healing, but it\ntakes decades of study and practice. I try to brush up on it myself every\nonce in a while for an emergency. I can cauterize a wound competently or\nremove a bullet without damaging the tissue. Simple stuff. Much more and\nI’d probably do more damage than good.”\n“What are you strongest in?”\nBo gave a little chuckle. “Careful whom you ask that. It can be a grave\ninsult.”\n“What? I just… oh. I didn’t know.” How was that an insult? It was just\na question.\n“You couldn’t have known,” Bo said. “Privileged love secrets. We\nhoard them like a squirrel does nuts and share them only sparingly. One of\nthose secrets is our strengths and weaknesses. Now, over time, a healer will\nbecome known as a healer, or a fire Privileged known to do fire. But at the\nbeginning, when you’re most vulnerable as a person, you’ll want to keep\nthat information close to you. It could save your life in a duel with another\nPrivileged.”\n“I see,” Nila said. Except she didn’t, really. Were all Privileged so\nmistrustful?\nBo held up his forefinger. “My strongest is air. Then water, fire, earth,\naether.”\n“Well, wait,” Nila said crossly. “Why would you tell me that after —”\n“Because I trust you,” Bo interrupted her. “And because I’m confident\nin myself and I have enough of a reputation that most Privileged already\nknow my strengths and weaknesses. Once people have heard of you and\nhad a chance to ask around, it’s hard to keep that kind of thing a secret.”\n“Then why is it considered rude to ask them directly?” Nila demanded.\n“Because,” Lady Winceslav spoke up suddenly, “you’re implying that\nthey’re fool enough to tell you something that could leave them open to\nattack.

Her window showed\nnothing but hillside for almost a quarter of a mile, so she turned to the\nattaché case of papers she still clutched in her hands.\nShe had read most of the requisition reports from before Taniel was\ncaptured by the Kez. With only a few pages to go, she leafed through them\nslowly, scanning each line.\nShe had always thought that quartermasters must have the dullest task\nin an army, but the way the numbers read on the lines was almost\nmesmerizing. She imagined that with more experience, she could read these\nnumbers and know exactly how many infantry or cavalry an army had, or\nthe tactical tastes of a particular general.\nOne line caught her eye about halfway down the page. She read it over\na second time, then a third, checking the date.\n“Bo…” she said.\n“Hmm?”\n“Has anyone mentioned Taniel’s movements the day before he was\nhoisted above the Kez camp?”\nBo scratched one of his muttonchops. “I talked to one of the camp\ncooks – the ones that used to be Mihali’s assistants. Taniel visited Mihali in\nthe late afternoon.”\n“Did they say why?”\n“No. But I can take a guess. He’s bloody stupid enough to go after\nKresimir alone. That’s the only way he would have been captured, after all.\nAnd he probably went to Mihali for advice.”\n“And he would have left immediately for the Kez camp?”\n“Search me.” Bo shrugged. “Why?”\n“It must be nothing.” Nila flipped the page, reading through the\nrequisitions and dates, but there were no more requisitions reported by\nTaniel. She felt her breath quickening suddenly. “Bo…”\n“What is it?” he asked, shaking his head peevishly as if his thoughts\nhad been interrupted.\n“Do you remember me telling you what Colonel Etan had told me?\nAbout the two companies of soldiers Hilanska had sent to the mountains?”\n“Yes, yes. Get on with it.”\nShe handed Bo the report. “Look at this requisition made by Taniel,\nabout halfway down the page.”\n“I see it.” He ran his eyes over it several times before saying, “This\ndoesn’t make any sense. Why the bloody pit would Taniel requisition three\nhundred air rifles?”\nNila leaned forward. “Back when I was Tamas’s laundress, I overheard\nhim say that all the air rifles in Adro had been locked up in an armory in\nAdopest with strict orders that only a powder mage could order them.

What’s going on?”\nBo leapt out of the carriage. “A traitor would know Taniel had been\ncaptured and that they could falsify the report.”\n“To what end?”\n“If he thought that Tamas might return, perhaps. It doesn’t matter.\nHilanska has sent his men, armed with air rifles, to hunt down Taniel.”\n“How do you know?” Nila asked.\n“Three hundred air rifles are enough to outfit two companies of Adran\nsoldiers. Two companies sent into the mountains on Hilanska’s orders. If\nthat’s a coincidence, I’ll eat my hat. I have to go.”\n“I’m coming with you,” Nila said.\n“No. Stay with the Lady. No one must slow me down. I’m going to\nrain fire and earth down on those two companies, and anyone near me will\nbe torn apart.”\n“Then why two horses?”\nBo tugged on his Privileged gloves. “So that when one drops dead\nbeneath me, I can keep riding.”\nCHAPTER 11\nA\ndamat waited with Brigadier Abrax as General Ket went over the\ndocuments he had brought.\nThey were in Ket’s personal tent. The guards outside had been\ndismissed. Ket slowly leafed through the documents, first reading the arrest\nwarrant issued by Ricard Tumblar and the two judges in Adopest and then\nlooking through the list of charges and evidence presented to the court in\nthe case against her and her sister.\nIt must have been thirty minutes before she finally shuffled the papers\ntogether cleanly and set them on the table in front of her, leaning back. She\nlooked from Adamat to Abrax and then back again.\n“Do you deny these charges?” Adamat asked, glad to finally break the\nsilence.\n“I do not.”\nThat was a surprise. “I was sent here to arrest you,” Adamat said.\n“You understand the current situation?” Ket asked.\nBeside Adamat, Abrax nodded. “Yes.”\n“You expect me to recuse myself,” Ket said, “hand over command of\nmy men to Hilanska, and go with you to Adopest?” Before Adamat could\nanswer, she continued, “I won’t do that. Hilanska is a traitor. He intends on\nselling us all out to the Kez. Whatever it is that I’m guilty of, treachery is\nnot one of those things.”\nShe had told them as much about Hilanska when they arrived, but had\nbeen unable to present evidence. She claimed that her own witness had been\npoisoned by one of Hilanska’s men.\n“Actually,” Adamat said, “that’s not what we had in mind.”\nKet cocked an eyebrow, her first change of expression since they\narrived. “Oh?”\n“I’ve spoken to Lady Winceslav on your behalf,” Adamat said. “She\nagreed that whatever petty crimes you and your sister are guilty of are\nsecondary to the safety of Adro. As a member of Tamas’s council, she has\ngiven me the authority to offer you an out.”\n“And what could that possibly be?”\n“You will immediately step down from command.

You will be escorted to your estate in\nnorthern Adro, where you will have one week to put your affairs in order\nbefore you and your households will be exiled. You will be allowed a\nonetime stipend of one million krana, and your property will be confiscated\nby the state.”\nKet’s nostrils flared. “That is not an out. That’s a sentence.”\n“One million is a lot of money,” Abrax said sternly. “Do you think\nTamas will be so kind when he returns?”\n“Tamas is dead.”\n“He is not.” Abrax removed a letter from her pocket and handed it to\nKet. “We received this communication just this morning. Tamas has crossed\nthe Charwood Pile with the Seventh and the Ninth and sixty thousand Deliv\ninfantry. He will be here in two weeks.”\nAdamat felt his jaw drop. Tamas was alive? For certain? Why had\nLady Winceslav not mentioned this? It changed everything!\nKet paled visibly. She took up the arrest warrant once more, her\nfingers shaking, and read it over thoroughly.\n“I suggest,” Adamat said, “that you be sure to be out of the country by\nthe time he arrives.”\n“What of my men? Who will take command?”\n“I will,” Abrax said.\n“That is not legal!”\n“And you are concerned about what is and isn’t legal?” Adamat asked\nlightly.\nKet rounded on Adamat. “I have covered for my sister’s crimes, yes.\nBut I am still a general of the Adran army and I am a patriot. I will only\ntake this ‘clemency’ ” – she spit the word as if it were poison – “on the\ncondition that my men will be safe.”\n“Your men will be placed under special command of the Wings of\nAdom,” Abrax said. “We will immediately send Hilanska a missive stating\nthat you have been relieved and that your three brigades are under our\nemploy – and protection – until Field Marshal Tamas returns to the field.”\nKet’s fingers drummed on the table and she stared hard at the air above\nAdamat’s head.\n“General,” Adamat said, “this is the only way they will survive. Surely\nyour scouts have told you that the Kez are already positioning themselves to\nattack tomorrow morning, and General Hilanska is positioning for a\nflanking maneuver.”\n“More proof that he’s working with the Kez,” Ket said.\nAdamat shared a nervous glance with Abrax. “Even if that’s true, he\ndare not attack once your brigades are under the Wings of Adom flag.”\nKet leapt to her feet suddenly. “All right! I agree. I relinquish\ncommand. I’ll take my sister and go. Just let me address the men one last\ntime.” There was a note of appeal in her voice that hadn’t been there before,\nand Adamat could see she was in earnest.\nAbrax met her gaze with steel in her eyes. “You will not have the\nchance to mend your reputation, Ket.

    "text": "chance to mend your reputation, Ket. Your men will know you as a thief\nand a liar.”\nAnger and grief danced across Ket’s face – raw emotions of which\nAdamat wouldn’t have guessed her capable.\nSlowly, Abrax stood, and with a sigh she added, “I will make certain\nthey know that you stepped down with their best interests at heart.”\nKet’s only answer was a defeated nod.\nAbrax clasped her hands behind her back and squared her shoulders.\n“General Ket,” she said, “you are relieved of command.”\nMorning came with an unwelcome chill in the Wings of Adom camp.\nAdamat stared, bleary-eyed, as Kez infantry began to form just within\nview, a couple of miles to the south. Their tan-and-green uniforms made\nthem look like acres upon acres of fall wheat ready for the harvest. How\nmany infantry did the Kez have left? Two hundred thousand? Three?\nAbrax’s scouts said that they’d brought up fresh levies from Budwiel during\nthe night.\nHe jumped at the sudden blast of a cannon. Several more followed,\nand Adamat knew he should get used to the noise. For now it was just\nAbrax warning the Kez to keep their distance. It would get worse as the\nmorning wore on and hundreds of cannons opened fire on every front.\nAbrax stood beside him, looking out from their vantage on top of a hill\nwhere Ket’s command tent had been. Instead of the Kez, she was watching\nto the northeast.\n“Any word?” Adamat asked.\nThe bulk of the Adran army, under Hilanska’s command, was hidden\nby the hills.\n“We sent over thirty messengers throughout the night,” Abrax said, her\nvoice raw. “At least ten of whom were shot on sight. I don’t know what\nHilanska has told his men, but he has turned them against us completely.\nLady Winceslav would have gone herself if I hadn’t prevented it.”\n“Where is the Lady now?” Adamat asked. The Lady, along with\ntwenty-six thousand Wings infantry, had joined them yesterday evening.\nThey’d brought along news of the intercepted missive – Hilanska’s\ntreachery. Adamat had hoped that at least Bo would be with them, but only\nNila arrived. What good could a barely trained Privileged do?\n“I sent her back to Adopest with a hundred of my best cavalry,” Abrax\nsaid. “I won’t let her die on the field.” There was a long silence as Abrax\ncontinued to watch the northeast, and then she said, “You’ve killed us all,\nAdamat.” There was no accusation or anger in the words. Just a dull\nacceptance.\nThe realization that they would all be slaughtered by nightfall\ndescended on Adamat’s shoulders. He felt his chest tighten and forced\nhimself to take slow, deep breaths. Hilanska was a traitor. He would attack\nthe Wings of Adom, destroying both them and their three adopted brigades\nof Adran infantry, and then… what? Order his men to surrender to the Kez?\nWould they follow such an order? Or would the Kez simply swarm and\nslaughter them as well?\nThe Adran army would destroy itself, and then the Kez would be fresh\nto fight Field Marshal Tamas and the Deliv when they arrived."

They were hemmed in with no possibility\nof escape. Abrax had ordered ditches dug and fortifications built. She was\ndetermined to make a last stand of it, but Adamat could see the stress lines\non her face and the purple circles under her eyes from a sleepless night.\nAbrax’s head twitched, and Adamat turned to follow her gaze. On the\ndistant hills to the northeast, a horseman had appeared. It paused, watching\nthem, and then Adamat saw the glitter of the sun off bayonets on the crest\nof the hill.\n“They’re coming,” Abrax said.\nCHAPTER 12\n“W\nhere the pit is everyone?” Tamas demanded.\nThe corporal before him, standing over his breakfast with a spoon\nforgotten in his hand, stared openmouthed at Tamas.\nThe Adran camp was nearly empty. Only a small guard had been left\nwith the thousands of hangers-on, and the sea of tents had been abandoned.\nThat meant only one thing: Battle would be joined today. Tamas could\nsmell it on the wind, and despite his exhaustion and the ache deep in his\nbones, he felt a thrill course through him.\nOlem sawed at the reins of his mount to bring it closer to the corporal.\n“You heard the field marshal, soldier. Speak up!” Steam rose from their\nhorses from the long, hard ride through the night.\n“I’m, I’m…” the corporal stuttered. “I’m so sorry, sir. They’re…” He\nlifted one arm to point southwest. “They’ve gone to battle.”\n“Bloody pit,” Tamas swore. Why would Hilanska choose to join battle\nnow? The Kez would still outnumber the Adran army, and on the open\nplains like this the Kez would be able to bring their superior numbers to\nbear with devastating effect. “Do you hear that, Olem? Cannon fire.”\n“I hear it, sir.”\n“Sir!” Vlora raced toward them through the camp, having gone ahead\nto try to find the General Staff. She arrived panting and took the reins of her\nhorse from Olem, swinging into the saddle. “Sir, they’re not attacking the\nKez!”\n“Then who the pit would they be attacking?” Tamas asked.\n“They’re attacking our own men. General Ket had separated her\nbrigades from the army, and Hilanska is attacking her!”\n“Ride!” Tamas bellowed, digging his heels in, feeling his stallion leap\nforward.\nThe three of them galloped through the Adran camp and then\nsouthwest, following the trail of his brigades. The sweat poured down\nTamas’s face despite the cool wind racing past. What had happened? How\ncould a disaster of this magnitude occur? He was going to find Ket and\nstring her up by her own bootlaces.\nThey rode several miles along the main highway, and with each\ncrested hill Tamas got a slightly better glimpse of the forces arrayed to their\nsouth. His heart thundered in his chest and he clung to the neck of his horse,\nurging more speed.\nThey reached the rear of the Adran lines. Soldiers leapt out of their"

Soldiers leapt out of their\nway as they thundered through. Tamas spotted the command tent placed at\nthe height of a hillock overlooking the artillery and veered toward it.\nSoldiers were beginning to look curiously in his direction, but he ignored\nthem, pushing on.\nHe leapt from his mount, tossing the reins to a startled infantryman,\nand advanced on the command tent. He threw back the flaps. “Damn it,\nHilanska, what is going on here?”\nSeveral dozen eyes stared at him in dumb confusion.\n“Well?” Tamas asked.\nChaos broke out among the assembled officers. There were\nprotestations and exclamations and hands reaching for him. More than one\nchair was knocked over as men sprang to their feet. A cacophony of voices\nall tried to speak to him at once.\n“Quiet down!” Olem roared.\n“Thank you, Olem. Now, tell me, what’s going on here?” Tamas\nsearched for familiar faces and was saddened to see so few. Had they lost\nthat many men since he’d been gone?\n“We’re about to commence battle with the traitor General Ket,” a\ncolonel said from the back.\n“Like pit we are,” Tamas said. “Olem… no, Vlora. Take a white flag\nacross the valley. I want Ket here in person within the hour to give me an\nexplanation as to what’s happening.”\n“She won’t come,” the same colonel spoke up. “She refuses to see our\nmessengers.”\n“She’ll see me. Was that the Wings of Adom’s colors I saw above\nKet’s camp?”\nA female general whom Tamas only vaguely recognized gave him an\nuncertain nod.\n“Then bring me Brigadier Abrax as well, or whoever is in charge.\nDismissed, Captain.”\nVlora snapped a sharp salute and left the tent at a sprint.\n“Wheel our artillery to face south,” Tamas ordered. “I want all of our\ncavalry on our eastern flank – and I do mean all of them. Split them into\nthree groups and wait for my order. The Kez are preparing to advance.\nThey’ll come on at about ten o’clock, or I’m a horse’s ass. Keep our men\nfacing Ket’s troops, but make it damned clear that they are not to engage\ntheir fellow Adrans. If the Kez think we’re about to attack our own men,\nthey are going to get a damned big surprise. Get to it!”\nThe tent burst into a flurry of motion.\n“General Hilanska,” Tamas said, “what are you doing? Sneaking out\nthe back? Get over here.”\nHilanska approached along the side of the tent, a wary eye on Tamas.\n“Sir?” he asked quietly.\n“Come with me.” Tamas threw back the tent flap. “Move the command\ntent up the hillside about forty paces,” he said to the guards outside. “I want\nto be able to see everything going on in that valley.” He strode up the hill\ntoward the spot he’d indicated, beckoning Hilanska along with him.

His\nbody ached from the ride, exhaustion tugged at his muscles, but the\nexcitement of the battle made his fingers twitch.\nWhen they reached the top, he turned to Hilanska, but his words\ncaught in his mouth. “Are you all right?” he asked.\nA sheen of sweat had appeared on Hilanska’s brow. His collar was\nalready soaked, and he was picking nervously at the buttons of his jacket.\nFour provosts had trailed them up the hill and stood back at a respectful\ndistance.\n“Fine, sir,” Hilanska said, dabbing at his cheeks. “What was it you\nwanted?”\nTamas turned toward the Kez forces. There were at least two hundred\nand sixty thousand infantry out there, along with twenty thousand or so\ncavalry. It was a sight to behold, but he couldn’t let the grandeur of it\nimpress him. He had work to do.\n“Hilanska, I want you to put your best gun crews there and there,” he\nsaid, pointing. “I want them to rain down everything they have on…\nHilanska, are you listening, I…” Tamas felt a sharp pain in his side. He\nscowled and rubbed at the spot. “Like I was saying, I want them to…”\nTamas felt himself shoved forward suddenly and heard a shout. He\nwhirled, a curse on his lips.\nOlem was shouting, his sword drawn, and was suddenly set upon by\nall four of the provosts who had followed them up the hill. Hilanska was\nbehind the provosts, a dagger in his one hand.\n“What the bloody pit is going on?” Tamas demanded. He reached for\nthe butt of his pistol instinctively, but his fingers slipped on it. He held them\nup, blinking back a sudden dizziness. Their tips were red.\nHe’d been stabbed.\nHilanska had bloody well stabbed him.\nThe one-armed general turned and fled down the hill.\nTamas sat in the grass, his jacket stripped from him and his shirt soaked\nwith blood, trying to make sense of what had happened.\nA surgeon sat behind him with his hands under Tamas’s arms while\nanother cut away his shirt and began to examine the stab wound between\nhis ribs. Not ten paces away, the bodies of two Adran provosts were being\ncarted away, while a third surgeon tended to a gash across Olem’s forehead.\nHilanska had betrayed him. That much was clear. But how deep did it\ngo? How long had the betrayal been in the works? Had Hilanska let\nBudwiel’s walls fall, trapping Tamas behind enemy lines months ago?\nHilanska had to be behind this schism with General Ket, working to ensure\nthe annihilation of the entire Adran army.\n“Olem!” Tamas had to know more. The most important question was,\nDid Hilanska have accomplices?\nOlem appeared a moment later, pressing a fresh bandage against his\nforehead. “Sir?”\n“Fine swordsmanship there,” Tamas said. Olem had held off all four\nprovosts until help could arrive. “Did any of them survive?”"

One will die by morning. The\nboys were rough on them when they saw that you were wounded.”\n“Rough won’t even begin to cover it,” Tamas said. “Go find out what\nthey know.”\n“Shouldn’t I go after Hilanska, sir?”\nTamas hesitated. “I don’t know whom to trust,” he said quietly. “Get\ntwo squads together – see if you can find any of your Riflejacks – and send\nthem after Hilanska. I want you to stay close.”\n“Yes sir.”\nTamas swore under his breath as one of the surgeons poked a finger at\nhis wound. “Bandage it up and get me some black powder. It didn’t hit a\nlung. I’ll live.” He beat the surgeons back with one hand and got unsteadily\nto his feet. The pain in his side was sharp now, and he was reminded of a\nsimilar wound he’d taken in Gurla twenty years before. He had been\nbedridden for weeks and nearly succumbed to infection.\nHe didn’t have time for that now.\nIn the valley below them he saw that the Wings of Adom had taken up\na defensive ring around Ket’s camp and had dug in with fortifications not\nunlike the kind Tamas had used against Beon je Ippile’s cavalry – though\nnot nearly as deep. He spotted Vlora racing along on her charger, white flag\nsnapping in the wind. She reached the Wings’ lines and after a few tense\nmoments was allowed past.\nThe Kez continued to fall into line. Their army looked immense – and\nit was – but its size made it ponderous. Tamas adjusted his initial guess that\nthey’d attack by ten. They wouldn’t be ready until at least noon. Maybe\none. They would attack straight out, using their superior numbers to\nsurround and overwhelm General Ket’s camp.\nTamas cracked a powder charge and sprinkled a bit on his tongue.\nOnce the initial shock of the powder trance passed, he felt younger and\nstronger and the pain from the knife wound was nothing but a tickle in the\nback of his mind.\nOut of the corner of his eye, Tamas saw Olem approaching.\n“Anything?” Tamas asked.\n“No sir. Both provosts claim that Hilanska warned them you might\nreturn but that it would be a Kez trick – a Privileged disguised as you. They\nalso claim he didn’t expect your doppelgänger for weeks.”\nTamas snorted. “So he panicked and ran when I arrived early? Let’s\njust be glad he wasn’t ready for us. Pit, what other rumors has he spread?”\n“I can try to find out, sir.”\n“Do it.”\n“Permission to search his quarters?”\n“Granted.”\nOlem was off again and Tamas looked around him for someone he\ncould trust. Most of the generals were with their brigades, and it seemed\nthat at least some of Hilanska’s support staff had fled with him.\n“You there!” Tamas called. “Colonel, come here.” From the side, the\nyoung man looked fairly familiar, and when he turned to Tamas, he"

    "text": "“You there!” Tamas called. “Colonel, come here.” From the side, the\nyoung man looked fairly familiar, and when he turned to Tamas, he\nrecognized the colonel immediately. “Colonel Sabastenien, it’s good to see\nyou alive.”\nThe former Wings of Adom brigadier was a short man in his\nmidtwenties with muttonchops filled with premature gray and a somber\nface. Tamas noted that the gray hadn’t been there the last time they met, and\nwondered whether it was dyed. He gave Tamas a respectful nod. “Likewise,\nsir. And it’s not Sabastenien. It’s Florone now. I’ve taken my mother’s\nfamily name. I prefer not to be immediately recognizable to my former\ncomrades.”\nTamas understood that. While he’d done nothing illegal or untoward in\nmurdering a traitor in Tamas’s defense, Sabastenien had been cast out of the\nWings of Adom because the traitor had been a fellow brigadier – and Lady\nWinceslav’s lover.\n“All right, Saba… Florone. I need a battle plan. Where are you\nassigned?”\n“I’m with the Twenty-First Artillery.”\n“And you have artillery experience?”\n“Seven years of it with the Wings.”\n“Good. Congratulations, Florone. You’re now a general.”\nThe colonel blinked in surprise. “Sir?”\n“Take command of the Second. Bring their artillery around to the south\nand have the gun crews standing by. Have your infantry dig in to the east\nand west.”\n“Yes sir. Thank you, sir.”\n“Don’t thank me yet. I don’t know who I can trust in Hilanska’s\nbrigades. You might get stabbed in the back by the end of the day. If you\nhave any trusted support staff, take them with you.”\n“Yes sir.”\n“And General, have Mihali sent up here, would you?”\nFlorone hesitated for a moment. “No one’s told you yet?”\n“Told me what?”\n“Mihali is dead. He was killed by Kresimir two weeks ago.”\nTamas whirled to look back at the Kez formations and a cold sweat\nbroke out over his body, the back of his neck pricked by an eerie sensation\nof shock and grief, breaking the calm of his powder trance. If Mihali was\ndead, why hadn’t Adro been swept aside already? There shouldn’t be\nanything left of Adopest or the Adran army but dust without Mihali to\nbalance his brother’s power, and yet the country and its capital still stood.\nWhat could possibly be holding Kresimir back?\nHis attention was caught by movement in the Wings of Adom camp,\nand soon Vlora was racing back up the hillside. She blew past the Adran\nsentries and didn’t stop until she reached Tamas, leaping from her horse and\ntossing the reins to a startled messenger.\n“Where’s Ket?” Tamas asked.\n“Gone,” Vlora gasped. “She was ousted by Abrax and Adamat just\nyesterday on accusations of profiteering. Abrax thought it might mend the\nschism between the camps, but… sir, are you wounded?”\n“It didn’t mend the schism,” Tamas said, “because Hilanska planned a"

And what the pit is Adamat doing down here? Damn it\nall, this is when I needed Ket the most. Aside from Hilanska, she was the\nmost capable commander here. Where’s Abrax?”\n“On her way here.”\n“We don’t have more than a couple of hours before the Kez attack.\nGather the General Staff – I want as many senior officers as you can get\nwithin twenty minutes. We’ll send orders to the rest via messengers. Olem,\nwhat did you find?”\nOlem arrived at a sprint and paused briefly to catch his breath. “He left\neverything. Hilanska’s been in bed with the Kez since the beginning. I\nfound dozens of letters.”\n“Anything to tell us who his accomplices are?”\n“I haven’t had time to sort through it all.”\n“Time. Bloody pit, we need time more than anything else. I can’t plan\na defensive on such short notice, not against that monstrosity.”\n“Olem,” Vlora said, “did you find Hilanska’s personal seal?”\n“It was there with everything else.”\n“Get me a fresh horse!” Vlora yelled.\nTamas asked, “Where are you going?”\n“I need one of the Wings’ code breakers,” Vlora said. “Someone who\ncan replicate Hilanska’s cipher. If we move quickly, I think I can buy us an\nextra day.”\nTamas dictated a message for the Kez commanders based on the language\nHilanska used in his own letters and notes, then had a Wings code breaker\ntranslate it into Hilanska’s cipher. The message stated that Hilanska would\nbe able to get someone close enough to Abrax to assassinate her if she let\ndown her guard, but that that would require the Kez to appear to withdraw\nand get ready for an attack the next day.\nThe whole process took nearly two hours and looked, to Tamas’s eye,\nlike a rush job. It would be a miracle if the Kez believed it.\nBut if they did, it would buy them twenty-four precious hours to\nprepare for the Kez attack. Time they desperately needed in order to have\nany chance at winning this battle.\nTamas lifted his eyes to Olem, who was waiting in the entry to the\ncommand tent, hand casually on his pistol, as the Wings’ code breaker\napplied Hilanska’s own hot wax and seal to the forged message. Tamas took\nit from him and blew on the wax to cool it, then handed it over to Olem.\nOlem snapped a salute. “I’ve found a few of my most loyal Riflejacks,\nsir. I’ll send one of them over to the Kez with it.”\n“They know it’s a terrible risk? If the Kez sniff out the deception,\nthey’ll be killed. Or worse.”\n“Already have a man for the job. He knows.”\n“Good. That’s the only message I want going to the Kez. Tell the\nsentries they are to shoot on sight anyone who makes a break for the Kez\nlines.

When Olem was gone, he turned\nuncomfortably toward the code breaker, feeling the wound from Hilanska’s\nknife open at the movement and send a stab of pain through his belly that he\ntried to suppress. Slowly, hoping that the code breaker didn’t see his fingers\nshaking, Tamas broke open a powder charge and sprinkled a bit of black\npowder on his tongue. The resulting powder trance settled in, stilling the\npain.\n“Good work, soldier,” Tamas said.\n“Thank you, sir,” the code breaker said. “If I may say so, it’s a pleasure\nto have you back. I know Brigadier Abrax is relieved.”\nTamas forced a smile. “I’m glad to hear that. It’s good to be back. You\nknow, we didn’t have professional code breakers back in the Gurlish Wars. I\nhad to make do with giving some of my cleverest men special duty. It didn’t\neven occur to anyone to make it a regular duty until Lord Winceslav. I’ve\nbeen telling myself for fifteen years that we need our own code breakers in\nthe Adran army, but somehow it always got pushed down the list.”\n“I had the good fortune to work with Lord Winceslav,” the code\nbreaker said. “He was a very intelligent man.”\n“I agree. It was a shame to lose him. But your Lady is far more clever\nthan her husband was. I always wondered if she came up with the idea for\nthe code breakers and let her late husband take the credit.”\nThe code breaker remained silent, looking down at his feet.\n“I’m sorry if I ramble. You don’t have to respond to that.”\n“Thank you, sir.”\nOlem returned a moment later, giving Tamas a sharp nod to tell him\nthat the messenger had left. “Soldier,” Tamas said to the code breaker, “you\ncan head to the mess and get some breakfast. Or lunch. I don’t even know\nwhat bloody time it is.”\n“Sir, permission to return to the Wings?”\nTamas glanced at Olem, who stepped up next to the code breaker.\n“Sorry, soldier, but you’re going to have to stay here for a while. We’re\nkeeping it quiet that Field Marshal Tamas has returned. It’ll make it easier\nto pull one over on the Kez.”\n“I won’t tell anyone, I swear.”\n“We’d prefer not to risk it,” Olem said.\nThe code breaker glanced between Tamas and Olem. “Sir?”\n“I’m sorry,” Tamas said. “We’re keeping it quiet even among our own\nmen for as long as we can. We have to weigh the morale boost against the\nneed for secrecy.”\nThe code breaker frowned, then took a deep breath and straightened,\nsnapping out a salute. “I understand, sir.”\n“Good. I’ll let Abrax know how well you did here today.”\nOlem led the man outside and then returned a moment later with\nVlora. She looked dusty and tired, but her step was crisp. He could tell by\nthe smell of her that she had been burning a powder trance all morning.\n“How goes it over in the Wings’ camp?” Tamas asked."

The Wings have three\nbrigades pointed toward us. Abrax says if this ruse works, she’ll have time\nto wheel them around and be able to throw everything she has at the Kez by\nthe middle of tomorrow morning.”\n“And so we wait,” Tamas said.\nVlora nodded. “We wait.” She and Olem exchanged an unreadable\nglance. Tamas had been too focused on walking the line between going\npowder blind and managing the pain of his aching body with a powder\ntrance during the mad ride from the Deliv border to Adopest. But whatever\nthey had seemed to have cooled. “Has any word of my presence reached the\nWings infantry?”\n“Abrax is keeping it to herself and just two of her brigadiers. She\nagrees that we need to keep it a secret for as long as possible. A couple of\nthe officers may have recognized me, but she’s keeping a tight lid on it.”\n“Good.”\n“Word’s already starting to spread here,” Olem said.\n“Can’t be helped. They saw us ride in.”\n“I’ve sealed the camp,” Olem added. “No one in or out without orders\nuntil morning.”\n“Excellent work.”\nTamas noticed that Olem was fingering the colonel lapel pins that\nTamas had given to him outside Alvation. He was going to bring it up\nagain.\n“Sir,” Olem said.\nTamas snorted. “I’m not going to demote you, Olem.”\n“I would prefer if you did, sir.”\n“It’s not like I’ve given you your own command – at least, not beyond\nthe Riflejacks. You’re a colonel on special assignment. It’s not unheard of.”\n“But still…”\nTamas raised his hand in a gesture that he hoped would put an end to\nthe argument, though he knew that hope was vain. Olem was utterly\nconvinced he was not colonel material. “I like having you in a position\nwhere you can give orders,” Tamas said. “Try not to be so glum about it. I\nwon’t give you a large command until you’re ready for it. Mark my words,\nyou’ll be a general – a proper one – within ten years.”\nOlem looked as if he were about to laugh in Tamas’s face. He seemed\nto quell the urge. “I won’t shave, sir. Not even to make general.”\n“I like the beard,” Vlora said. “More soldiers should have them.”\n“Now, don’t you start.” Tamas pointed at her. “I’ll take that shit from\nhim because he’s my last line of defense against assassination. I won’t take\nit from you.”\n“Fine job he did with Hilanska.”\nOlem bristled at that, his back stiffening and his face going slack.\nTamas glanced at Vlora.

She had paled slightly and was looking at the floor. She\nalready regretted saying it.\n“Sir, is there anything else I can do?” Olem asked woodenly.\n“Stay close,” Tamas said. “But, speaking of Hilanska…”\n“I’ve got a whole company after him already. They’ll catch him and\nhis cohorts and bring them back in chains.”\n“You did well, Olem. And this minor thing” – he gestured to where the\nknife wound was hidden beneath his coat – “will heal in time.” He felt a\ntwinge of pain when he moved, despite his powder trance.\n“Yes sir.” The words were stiff.\nTamas rubbed his eyes. He usually used this time before a battle to\nmeet with his commanding officers and plan backup strategies, but he’d\nalready given the orders he’d needed to give, and everything was banked on\nthe Kez answer to his fake communiqué. If it worked, they’d have an extra\nday in which to plan. If it didn’t, battle would commence within the hour.\nHe knew he should be doing something. But he just couldn’t bring\nhimself to get moving. He tried to tell himself it was just exhaustion from\nthe road – a few moments of quiet and he would be ready to take on the\nroad. But he wasn’t just exhausted. His bones ached; every wound new and\nold hurt; and his mind longed for sleep. Age had caught up with him over\nthese last few months.\nAnd the fact that he couldn’t focus on the task at hand meant that he\nwas ignoring something more important.\n“Sir,” Vlora said quietly, “what of Taniel? We know where Hilanska\nsent his men. Perhaps…” She trailed off.\nThat couldn’t be more important than the task at hand. Taniel might be\nhis son, but he was merely one man. This day determined the fate of an\nentire country. “I know my duties, Captain,” Tamas said.\nVlora looked as if she wanted to say more. Instead, she crossed the\nroom to where Olem stood by the entrance. Olem eyed her, but did not stop\nher, when she reached inside his jacket for tobacco and rolling paper. She\nrolled a cigarette slowly, her eyes never leaving Olem’s face, then struck\none of his matches and lit the end, inhaling deeply. The smoke rolled out of\nher nostrils and she offered the cigarette to Olem.\nTamas thought of telling them both not to smoke in the tent, but he\nwanted to see how this played out. It was a peace offering, something to\ntake the sting off of what she’d said a minute ago.\nOlem took the cigarette and clenched it between his lips. Tamas felt\nhimself letting out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.\nThe tent flap swung open and someone whispered to Olem. “A\nmoment, sir,” Olem said, stepping outside.\nTamas found himself alone with Vlora.

He could deal with her accusations and\ndisappointment. He could fight that.\nHe couldn’t fight his own.\nOlem stepped into the tent once more, letting in a breeze tinged with\nthe smell of cigarette smoke. “Sir,” he said, “our man is back. The Kez\ndidn’t send back an answer, but their brigades are already leaving the field.\nWe have until tomorrow.”\nTamas got to his feet, coughing into his hand to hide the grimace of\npain. “Then let’s hope the Kez haven’t gotten more cunning since we left.\nHow many of your Riflejacks have you found so far?”\n“Hilanska sent them all back to their own companies. I’ve tracked\ndown about two hundred of the picked men.”\n“Gather them up, would you? We have work to do.”\nCHAPTER 13\nK\nresimir – or rather the doll used to control him – couldn’t be moved yet.\nTaniel had been fighting a growing panic all night. He hadn’t slept.\nHe’d barely eaten. The arrival of morning had only deepened his anxiety.\n“We have to go,” Taniel said.\nKa-poel shook her head adamantly. She crouched over a casket made\nof sticks and dried grass. It was a box, no bigger than a soldier’s kit, meant\nto contain a god.\n“They’ll be here by midday,” Taniel said.\nKa-poel didn’t respond. She’d finished the casket only a few hours\nago. Every moment since had been spent painting thin, perfectly straight\nlines on the outside using a horsehair brush she’d produced from within her\nrucksack. She used her blood for ink and it dried as a surprisingly bright\ncrimson, not at all the dark rust of dried blood.\nThe whole thing made Taniel uneasy – more so than usual.\n“Half a company of Adran infantry armed with air rifles are camped\nless than two miles away,” he said. “They’re climbing from their tents now\nand breaking camp, ready to continue their search. They’ll find us by\nmidday, if we’re lucky. We can’t possibly fight that many. They’ll kill us\nboth and then free Kresimir. We have to go.”\nKa-poel didn’t seem to agree with him. She kept painting, her hand\nsteady and slow, as if she’d not heard a word.\nTaniel touched her shoulder. “Pole…”\nShe whirled suddenly, throwing the brush across the cave and leaping\nto her feet. He found himself retreating from her advance. Her face was\ntwisted into a scowl and her fists were clenched at her sides. She backed\nhim up against the very edge of the cave and leaned toward him, managing\nto loom even though she was so much smaller than he. She tapped her hand\nagainst her chest, then the side of her head, and made a negative motion.\nShe repeated the series of gestures two more times and then pointed to the\ncasket.\nI don’t know what I’m doing.\nTaniel noticed for the first time that her hair and shirt were soaked with\nsweat.

    "text": "I don’t know what I’m doing.\nTaniel noticed for the first time that her hair and shirt were soaked with\nsweat. Her shoulders shook. Unshed tears shone in the corners of her eyes,\nand Taniel finally realized how much this was taking out of her. He knew\nthat Bone-eyes could create enchantments. They had made enchanted\nbullets called redstripes for the colonists in Fatrasta, and Ka-poel had even\ndone it once for him – though he’d never witnessed the process. This must\nbe like that.\nHe glanced at the casket and remembered the thin line of red that\nencircled the bullets and gave redstripes their names.\nOf course. This was exactly like redstripes. She had to use her own\nblood in the enchantments.\nWas that what she had done the other day when she wiped her blood\non his cheeks? Enchanted him? How much energy did this take? He saw her\nagain with new eyes, saw the depth of her exhaustion and how her eyes\nseemed sunken and her cheeks hollow. Her clothes hung off her as if on a\ntailor’s mannequin.\nShe was killing herself to keep Kresimir from breaking free, and yet\nshe still used some of her power on him.\nKa-poel returned to her project, silent as always.\nTaniel collected two knives and a bayonet that he’d taken from the\nAdran soldiers the other day. He regretted not stealing an air rifle. He could\nhave at least used it as a pike with a bayonet on the end, but in his\narrogance he’d broken them all in the Adran camp.\nHe kissed Ka-poel on the cheek, trying not to be put off by the way she\nturned away from him, and then left the cave behind, heading up and over\nthe ridge and then following it to the east toward the Adran camp.\nIt didn’t take him longer than an hour to spot the advance elements of\nthe company of Adran infantry. Six of them worked their way up the\ncanyon slowly, cautiously, their rifles clutched in both hands and their eyes\non the ridgelines high above them on either side.\nHe took up a position about three hundred yards above the floor of the\ncanyon and hunkered down to wait.\nThe vanguard turned out to be fifty paces ahead of the rest of the\ncompany. The company was forced to advance in single file and, unlike the\nvanguard, they weren’t apprising themselves of their surroundings. They\nwere fresh and overconfident. Some of the men joked, their chipper voices\nbouncing off the canyon walls. Taniel had hoped that his display to the\nsquad the other day would make them more cautious, but that didn’t seem\nto be the case.\nAfter all, they were only hunting one man and this was broad daylight.\nTaniel knew he couldn’t fight all eighty of them. He didn’t stand a\nchance.\nHe waited until the entire company was within sight, strung out as they\nwere along the canyon floor, and the center of the company was directly\nbelow his position. Then he lashed out with one foot at the log beside him\nand dashed out of the way as twenty tons of rubble immediately began to\nthunder down the canyon walls.\nHe couldn’t win, but he would damn well take as many of them to the"

    "text": "and dashed out of the way as twenty tons of rubble immediately began to\nthunder down the canyon walls.\nHe couldn’t win, but he would damn well take as many of them to the\nPit with him as possible.\nThe canyon echoed with the screams of the dying and the yells of the\nsurvivors as the thunder finally subsided in the wake of Taniel’s avalanche.\nThe sound made Taniel sick. He hadn’t wanted to kill his own\ncountrymen. These men had friends and family. Children and wives and\nhusbands. He might have fought beside some of them. He might have\ntrained beside them.\nIt was no different from killing any enemy, he reminded himself. This\nwas war. He had to kill or be killed.\nTaniel stealthily stuck his head out from his hiding place to examine\nhis handiwork.\nThe avalanche had cut the Adran company in half. At least ten of them\nhad been buried by the falling rocks and another dozen or so wounded. A\ncaptain was pinned to the floor of the canyon by a boulder on his leg, and\nTaniel could hear his howls of pain. A lieutenant stood above him, directing\na simultaneous defense-and-rescue mission. The infantry had scattered to\nwhatever cover they could find, and now everyone had their eyes on the\ncanyon’s walls.\nThey began to dig out their wounded, and when it became apparent\nthat an attack was not imminent, two squads continued their journey up the\ncanyon.\nThis was good news and bad news. The good news was that he’d split\ntheir forces. The bad news was that those two squads were heading toward\nKa-poel’s cave.\nHe set off at a run just beneath the ridgeline, where he could be plainly\nseen by the soldiers below. A shout of alarm followed him a moment later\nand he heard the soft pop of air rifles. The distance was far too great for\nthem to actually hit him, but he ducked behind a boulder anyway and took a\nmoment to look back.\nThe lieutenant pointed toward him, shouting after the two squads. The\ntwo squad sergeants conferred, and then one squad headed straight up the\nsteep incline toward Taniel while the other set about looking for a goat path\nor some other way to flank him.\nTaniel had their attention now, and that’s what mattered.\nHe led the two squads on a chase along the ridgeline for over a mile. Of the\ntwenty-four men, only three kept up with his pace, outstripping their\ncomrades in their attempt to catch up. After all, they only had to get close\nenough for a shot with an air rifle to bring Taniel down. Hilanska must have\noffered a reward for his head. Soldiers normally weren’t this zealous.\nThe thought hardened Taniel’s heart against his reluctance to kill more\nof his countrymen. These men would gun him down without hesitation.\nThey were hunting him like a dog.\nHe risked a dash across open ground, flinching at the pop of air rifles\nand the sound of bullets skipping off of the stone behind him. They were\nstill just out of range, but a lucky shot aimed high might wound him. He\nleapt a fissure and continued on for some thirty paces before the ground\ngave way to rockier terrain and he leapt back into cover.\nOut of sight of the squad, he doubled back, running in a crouch"

As the second set of legs flew overhead, he reached up and\ngrabbed a boot, yanking down. The man dropped his air rifle with a clatter\nand landed face-first on the lip of the fissure, leaving a smear of blood\nbehind.\nThe third of the group skidded to a stop and knelt beside his comrade.\nTaniel made a running leap and grabbed this one by the front of his jacket,\ndragging him back into the fissure. The soldier let out a strangled scream\nbefore Taniel silenced him by slamming his face repeatedly against the\nrocks. He snatched the air rifle from the dead man’s hands and checked it\nfor damage.\nAir rifles were notoriously more unreliable than conventional muskets\nand rifles. The mechanisms broke easily and the air reserves leaked. This\none seemed sound, and Taniel checked the chamber and shouldered the\nbutt.\n“Glouster?” The first pursuer had noticed his companion’s absence and\nturned. “Glouster, are you all right? Allier looks like he’s hurt bad. Pit,\nGlouster, say something!”\nTaniel felt a pang at the panic in the young man’s voice. The fear must\nbe setting in, overrunning his adrenaline. He’d be wondering if his eyes had\ntricked him. Hadn’t Taniel disappeared into the rocks ahead? How could he\npossibly be in that dark fissure?\nThe infantryman came into view, his rifle shouldered, squinting into\nthe fissure.\nTaniel shot him in the chest.\nHe took spare ammunition and air reserves from the dead infantrymen\nand followed his hidden path back to the rocks. The rest of the squad would\ncatch up any moment, and they wouldn’t be as stupid as their comrades.\nHe ambushed two more infantrymen in the rocks, and then three more\nafter them, using their bulky kits and unwieldy bayoneted rifles against\nthem in the close confines of the rock formations.\nHe shot another with his captured air rifle just a few moments later, but\nthe damned mechanism broke before he could fire another round, and he\nwas forced to flee, with the remainder of the two squads hot on his heels.\nThey stayed in a tight formation now, not letting themselves be led on\nby his tricks.\nTaniel knew he was running out of ground. This ridge went on for a\ncouple of miles before it meandered into one of the thousands of valleys\nthat crisscrossed this mountain range. He needed to be rid of the rest of his\npursuers before he doubled back and figured out a way to deal with the\nremaining infantrymen down in the canyon. There was another fissure\nalong here somewhere that would let him get behind his enemy and…\nTaniel swung around a boulder to find himself staring out into the sky."

There was another fissure\nalong here somewhere that would let him get behind his enemy and…\nTaniel swung around a boulder to find himself staring out into the sky.\nThe drop below him must have been more than two hundred feet down a\nsheer rock face into a barren streambed. He searched about him for another\nescape route, but there was nothing but bare, vertical rock to be found. A\nledge to his right gave way to more such rock and a narrow outcropping\nthat would doubtlessly give them a firing platform.\nSomewhere, he’d taken a wrong turn. He was at a dead end.\nHe looked back around the boulder the way he came. Maybe he had\ntime to get back and find another route before they caught up.\nThe flash of Adran blues sent him back behind his boulder. He could\nhear the shouts of his pursuers.\n“He went down this path here.”\n“Careful on that, no line of sight. He could be hiding anywhere.”\n“Cover me from above.”\n“All right, you three with me. Try to go around that way, lads.”\nTaniel risked a glance to see four soldiers working their way down the\ngoat path he’d followed. They were less than twenty paces away, and would\nreach him within moments. The other soldiers would find that outcropping\nsooner or later and he was a dead man.\nIf this damned air rifle hadn’t broken, he might be able to defend\nhimself at range.\nWhen the first bayonet came within sight around the edge of the\nboulder, Taniel reached past it to grab the barrel and leveraged his weight\nagainst the man holding it. Caught by surprise, the infantryman slid and\ntumbled several feet and then plummeted the rest of the way down into the\ngorge, the end of his fall punctuated by the silencing of his scream.\n“Bloody pit, he’s right there!”\n“Hold it together.”\n“He just threw Havin right off the edge! Did you see that? He’s going\nto…”\nTaniel didn’t wait to find out what the infantryman thought he was\ngoing to do. He rounded the corner, gripping his broken air rifle like a pike,\nand shoved the bayonet into the talking man’s chest. The man gave a\ngarbled yell and fell, grabbing the kit of the man behind him as he went and\nsending them both tumbling over the edge.\nTaniel and the last soldier stared at each other for a moment before the\nman brought his air rifle to his shoulder in one quick move and pulled the\ntrigger.\nClick.\n“They’re so damned unreliable, aren’t they?” Taniel asked.\nThe man swore and jabbed at Taniel with his bayonet. Taniel danced\nback to dodge the thrust and found himself slipping. He dropped his own\nrifle instinctively to grab for purchase and listened with a lump in his throat\nas his best weapon clattered down into the gorge.\nGravel shifted beneath him as he scrambled backward on his hands\nand feet as the soldier advanced with his bayonet. Taniel backed around the\nedge of the boulder and snatched for his knife. It wouldn’t be worth shit\nagainst a bayonet, but he had to try. He drew it just as the soldier was\nrounding the corner.

He teetered on his\nfeet, then was helped in his tumble off the edge by a firm shove by Ka-poel.\nShe held a bayonet in one hand, clutched by the ring, and her ratty\nclothes were stained by the blood of far more than that one poor\ninfantryman.\nTaniel let out a sigh of relief and his whole body sagged beneath him.\nShe’d saved his life. Again. He climbed to his feet and nodded his thanks,\nnot trusting himself to speak. All this adrenaline, this skirting of death, was\nfar harder to deal with when he was not in a powder trance.\nA bullet ricocheted off the boulder just above Ka-poel’s head. Taniel\ngrabbed her by the front of her jacket and pulled her into an embrace,\nknowing instinctively that the bullet had come from behind him. He caught\na glimpse of two soldiers standing on the outcropping that he’d spotted\nearlier. The second one was lining up his shot. Taniel could do nothing but\nput his body in between Ka-poel and the bullet and hope the man missed.\nFOOM.\nThe sound left Taniel’s ears ringing. When he managed to pull himself\naway from Ka-poel, the soldiers weren’t on the outcropping anymore. One\nof their hats lay on its side where they had just been, and a quick glance\nshowed him two more bodies down in the gorge.\nWhat the pit was that?\nThe crunch of boots on stone made him cringe. More infantry?\nA familiar figure strolled out to the end of the narrow outcropping. He\nwore ruddy muttonchops and a suit of clothes that, if they hadn’t been so\ntravel-worn and dusty, would probably cost as much as a horse.\nPrivileged Borbador kicked the infantryman’s hat after its owner and\nwatched it soar down into the gully.

There were a dozen or more times that she had stared\ndeath in the face.\nYet none of them seemed more certain than now.\nSomething had been done to buy the Adran army an extra day. She’d\nseen a messenger rush from General Hilanska’s camp yesterday afternoon,\ncrossing over to the Kez lines, and the anticipated attack had never come.

Nila stood near the Wings of Adom command tent, where she could\nsee messengers running to and fro and hear the bark of Abrax’s stern alto.\nThe Wings of Adom and the three brigades of Adran soldiers that Ket\nhad handed over would be crushed between the two enemy armies.\nThere wasn’t even any place to run.\nRumors swirled among the Wings of Adom. A captain claimed that\nthey’d seen one of Field Marshal Tamas’s powder mages. An infantryman\nclaimed that Deliv had entered the war and were sending reinforcements,\nbut that they were still weeks away. Another said that this was all a ruse by\nHilanska and that once the Kez forces advanced, Hilanska’s army would\nswing around and hit them in the flank.\nSoldiers would say anything to keep up morale, it seemed.\nEven if all of those things were the case, they would still be crushed by\nthe Kez. There were just too many of them. Their army could swallow the\nentirety of the Wings of Adom mercenary company five times over and still\nhave room for more. The Wings’ infantry – impressively – kept up a\nprofessional front, but she could see the panic in the eyes of the rank-and-\nfile soldiers and their officers.\nThey would all be dead by morning.\n“Ma’am,” a voice said at Nila’s elbow, startling her.\nShe regained her composure and turned to the young lieutenant. He\ncouldn’t have been much older than Nila and he wore his black hair slicked\nback under his bicorne and tied in a bow behind his head. He favored her\nwith a nervous smile.\n“Yes?”\n“Brigadier Abrax has requested your presence.”\nNila frowned over toward Abrax. The brigadier had exited her tent and\nwas standing just thirty paces off, staring balefully at the Kez army. Why\nhadn’t she just come over herself? “Of course.”\nNila joined Abrax in front of the command tent. “You wished to see\nme, ma’am?”\n“Is it still a secret that you’re a Privileged?”\nNila blinked back at her. “I… well, I assume so. Bo said that I was still\ntoo green for my aura to show in the Else, so the enemy Knacked or\nPrivileged shouldn’t know I’m here.”\n“The enemy has no Privileged. Or,” Abrax corrected herself, “the ones\nthey do have amount to very little. None of the mountain throwers of the\nroyal cabal.” She turned to Nila suddenly. “Have you told anyone?”\n“No.”\n“Keep it that way. You’re to be our trump card.”\nNila couldn’t help but laugh at that. She stifled it as best she could, but\nit still leaked out as a giggle.\n“Something funny, Privileged?”\nPrivileged. Being addressed as such sent a shiver down Nila’s spine,\nsobering her instantly. “It’s just that I’m only a trainee. I’ve barely learned\nto look into the Else, let alone command the elements. I won’t be any help\nat all in a fight.”"

I won’t be any help\nat all in a fight.”\n“You can’t do any sorcery?” Abrax sounded skeptical.\n“I can light my hand on fire. But only when I get very startled or\nangry.”\nAbrax turned away, looking slightly disgusted. “We have some\nPrivileged, but they’re very weak. They won’t do much more damage than a\nwell-placed field gun and they’re far more fragile. Borbador told me you\nwere powerful. I’d hoped you’d be of some help.”\nBo had said that to Abrax? Why on earth? Nila was untrained, and Bo\nknew that better than anyone.\n“I’m sorry,” Nila ventured.\n“I didn’t realize you were that green. Stay back with the baggage.\nYou’ll do nothing but get underfoot near the front. And whatever you do,\ndon’t attempt any sorcery. You’ll likely kill everyone around you. It’s\nunfortunate your bloody master abandoned us. He might have tipped this in\nour favor.” Abrax strode away without another word, barking orders.\nNila stared after her, indignation warring with a sense of helplessness.\nBo had abandoned her. She knew just enough to know that maybe, with a\nfew months more training, she could have defended herself. But she\ncouldn’t be of any use here. She was no better than the rest of the camp\nfollowers – part of the luggage. She was back to being with the laundresses\nand all the rest.\nAbrax could go to the pit. If – when – the Kez broke the line, Nila\nwould fight. She didn’t care if she took the whole baggage train with her.\nThe baggage and camp were about a quarter of a mile behind the front line.\nThe area had been fortified with hastily dug entrenchments and was\nguarded by a brigade of Wings of Adom mercenaries stretched out – to\nNila’s eye – over far too much ground.\nThe camp followers had been ordered to stay behind when the Wings\nhad marched to General Ket’s aid, but even so there had to be several\nthousand people with the baggage, essential personnel such as wagoners,\nquartermasters, and the like.\n“Shouldn’t you be near the front?”\nNila turned to find Inspector Adamat sitting on the ground nearby,\nlooking older and wearier than he had just a few days before.\n“Abrax sent me back here. I don’t have enough training to be useful.”\n“Ah. I suppose that’s true enough.” He smiled as if to soften the\ncomment. “I’m too old to be of any use.”\n“I’ve seen infantrymen with ten years or more on you.”\n“I haven’t held a rifle in line since drills at the academy. I’m more\nlikely to stick my bayonet into the man beside me than I am to be of any use\nup there.”\nNila wondered if that were the case. She knew that Adamat had led the\ncharge against Lord Vetas’s men. He was more than capable. Perhaps he’d\nused his age as a pretense to avoid the front. Nila wouldn’t have blamed\nhim. Courage, Bo had told her, was overrated."

He stared at his feet\nfor a few moments, then raised his head. “They don’t have enough men\nback here to guard the rear.”\n“I was told an entire brigade.”\n“The Kez will flank us to the west while General Hilanska hits us from\nthe northeast. I predict this position will be overrun by” – he glanced at his\npocket watch – “one o’clock. If we’re lucky, we’ll be killed outright.” He\nfingered his cane as if he were wondering how much of a fight he had left\nin him.\n“Lucky? I thought it would be preferable to be taken prisoner.”\nHe gave her a skeptical look. “Of course.”\nIf we survive, he’ll be sent to a Kez workhouse. And I’ll be passed\naround the infantry until I’m sent to a workhouse as well. Unless an officer\ncatches me first. Then I’ll be at his mercy, little more than a slave.\nWas that preferable to being killed outright?\nAdamat climbed to his feet. The Wings’ field artillery had begun to\nfire, and even at a quarter mile, the sound shook Nila. She remembered the\nfighting in Adopest between Tamas’s men and the royalists and the\ncountless sleepless nights she’d had after escaping. This was going to be so\nmuch worse.\n“The sound gets to me, too,” Adamat said. “Infantrymen might get\nused to it, but we’re just civilians. Artillery is terrifying.”\n“Like Privileged.”\n“Yes. Like Privileged.” He examined her out of the corner of his eye.\nNila pretended not to notice. Yes, she wanted to say, I am a Privileged.\nBut I can’t do anything yet.\nA distant sound caught Nila’s ear. It was hard to hear beneath the\nreport of the artillery fire, but she knew it immediately when she turned\ntoward the Kez lines. It was the rat-tat-tat of snare drums. The Kez\ncolumns, infantry in their tens of thousands, were advancing.\nThe lump in Nila’s throat felt like she had swallowed a carriage. She’d\nnever been this terrified, not even beneath Vetas’s threats.\nShe wondered if Jakob was getting along well with Adamat’s children.\nHe was a good boy, still far too young to manage on his own. “Will Faye\ntake care of Jakob after I die?” she asked.\n“You won’t die,” Adamat said halfheartedly. After a pause, he added,\n“She’s not the type to turn out a child.”\nNila gave a soft sigh of relief. “I didn’t think so, but I don’t know her\nall that well.”\nSeveral moments passed as they watched the Kez continue to advance\ninto the onslaught of artillery fire. “How the bloody pit did I end up here?”\nAdamat muttered.\nNila didn’t think it was meant to be heard. What was going on in the\nold inspector’s head? Was he thinking of his children? Or was he trying to\nthink of a way out? Nila knew that’s how she should have been thinking.\nShe glanced toward the lazy fields to their northwest. Maybe she could run"

Hide in some farmer’s wheat field until nightfall and then strike out\ntoward Adopest.\nIt was worth a shot. Wasn’t it?\nThe sight of something moving out there on the plains killed her hasty\nplans.\n“There are soldiers out there,” Nila said. Adamat turned and gazed\ntoward the northwest for a few moments, squinting.\n“Cavalry.” He spit in the dirt and turned toward the closest Wings\nofficer, but it was plain they had already spotted the enemy. A ripple of\npanic went up among the brigade guarding the camp, and officers had to\nshout to drown it out.\nAdran cavalry. Nila had no idea of their number, but they took her\nbreath away. There must have been thousands. Breastplates glittered in the\nsun and their Adran-blue jackets and red-striped pants stood out against the\ntan fields of grain. They must have circled around far to the north and were\nnow blocking the only avenue of retreat.\nA Wings colonel sent a messenger running for the front lines. The\ncolonel’s face was pale and she gripped her belt with white-knuckled\nintensity.\nAdamat gave a resigned sigh. “I guess that was predictable,” he said.\n“Looks like at least three battalions of cuirassiers.”\n“Cuirassiers?”\n“Heavy cavalry. You can tell by the breastplate. Adran cuirassiers\narmor their horses as well.” Adamat pointed to the Wings’ infantry as they\nfell into lines behind the waist-high breastworks that were their only\ndefense. “They’ll break a thin bayonet line like this one without too much\nproblem.”\nAdamat headed closer to the rear of the camp, where the Wings’\ninfantry were preparing to make their stand. Nila hesitated for a moment\nand then followed him.\nThe Wings’ colonel gave him a glance as he approached. “Civilians\nshould keep away from the front,” she said.\n“The front is that way,” Adamat said, pointing behind him.\n“Tighten up your men, Cronier,” the colonel shouted. “If a single man\nruns, I’ll gut him myself!” She looked at Adamat and Nila once more but\nrefrained from commenting.\nThe Adran cuirassiers drew closer. They were taking their time and it\nwasn’t until they stopped some half mile away that Nila realized they were\nlikely waiting for a signal from General Hilanska. They would charge the\nrear right as the Kez charged the front.\nLooking back to the south, she noted that the Kez were still advancing\nat a slow, methodical rate. The Wings’ artillery left scars throughout their\nranks, but it seemed to have no more effect than would scratching a giant.\nThey just kept coming on.\nOn the hill to their northeast, General Hilanska’s infantry suddenly\nsurged forward, advancing at a pace just faster than the Kez.\nTo the northwest, some three thousand cuirassiers began to advance at\na trot.\nIt seemed to Nila as if she could see her death advancing across those\nfields.

They moved in perfect coordination, the plumes\non their horses’ heads and the feathers in their steel helmets blowing with\nthe breeze. She wondered if the ground really was shaking, or if it was just\nher imagination.\n“Over there,” Adamat said, his voice coming out a dry croak, “to the\nwest. Looks like a battalion of Adran lancers.”\nShe knew that term. More cavalry. Lightly armed.\n“They’ll swing around and hit our front lines from the west,” the\nWings’ colonel said. She immediately dispatched another messenger to the\nfront, just as the first messenger returned.\nThe messenger saluted. “Brigadier Abrax orders you to hold your\nfire.”\n“Hold my —” The colonel’s face turned red. “Hold my fire? What the\npit is that supposed to mean? Those cuirassiers will crush us!” She sent the\nmessenger back to the front and fumed silently.\nNila tore her gaze away from the advancing cuirassiers. To the\nnorthwest, the Adran artillery batteries suddenly belched flame and smoke,\ntheir barrels pointed toward the Wings’ encampment. Nila squeezed her\neyes shut, remembering the terrible whistling of cannon fire at the royalist\nbarricades, and waited for the horrible sound.\nIt never came. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the\ndistant figures of the Adran artillerymen busy reloading. “What are they\naiming for?” she asked.\nAdamat frowned. “I don’t know.”\nAnother salvo followed, and Nila strained to see where the cannonballs\nwere landing. The artillery seemed pointed straight at her. She had no idea\nhow far a cannon would fire, but why would they fire at all unless they\nwere going to hit something?\n“I don’t think they’re firing at anything,” the Wings’ colonel suddenly\nsaid. She sounded surprised by her own outburst. “There’s no chance they\nwould overshoot us at that range and…” She fell silent as more of the\nAdran cannons opened fire.\nNila twisted her head. Was that the sound of muskets? To the south, a\nlow cloud of black smoke hung over the battlefield, and she heard a sudden\nroar: a hundred thousand voices as the Kez lines charged.\nThe battle had begun.\nIt would end soon enough for her. The cuirassiers were still advancing\nat a trot, but they would charge momentarily. They couldn’t be more than a\nfew hundred yards away. She looked down at her right hand and tried to\nwill the fire to come. She had to go down fighting. She couldn’t let herself\nbe killed like a commoner. Not now. Not after everything she’d been\nthrough.\nHer hand began to feel warm, but nothing happened. She concentrated\nharder. Bo had said she was powerful. Surely she could do something.\nAnything!\nA cry went up among the Wings’ infantry, and Nila looked up, her\nconcentration broken, to see that the cuirassiers had suddenly changed\ndirection.

The Wings’ colonel barked orders, shifting her men to\nprotect that side of the camp.\nThe Adran cuirassiers continued on, swinging wide of the camp and\nthen even wider of the Wings’ front lines.\nNila didn’t understand. Were they going to flank the Wings’ front line?\nThen what about the lancers that Adamat had seen? Where the pit were all\nthese cavalry going?\nShe didn’t understand until she caught sight of the Adran artillery.\nTheir crews had stopped firing over the Wings’ camp and had readjusted to\nface south, toward the Kez lines. General Hilanska’s Adran infantry\nswiveled along with the artillery, moving forward to take up positions not\nagainst the Kez front, but beside it.\nA messenger on horseback arrived at full gallop and reined in beside\nthe Wings’ colonel.\n“Orders from Brigadier Abrax!” the messenger gasped. “Swing your\nmen around and prepare to act as auxiliary to the front lines. The Adran\nattack was a ruse. General Hilanska is no longer in command of the Adran\narmy and they will fight on our side!”\nThe colonel gave orders to a nearby captain and then grabbed the\nmessenger’s horse by the bridle. “Who the pit is in charge, then?”\n“Why, Field Marshal Tamas. He has returned.”\nNila swayed on her feet, feeling suddenly weak. Tamas was still alive?\nAnd he was in command? Maybe, just maybe, she would survive this day.\n“Nila,” Adamat said kindly, “your arm is on fire.”\nShe looked down to find a blue nimbus of flame surrounding her right\nhand and engulfing her arm to the elbow. She waved her arm to put it out,\nand then, experimentally, she touched her thumb and forefinger together.\nThe flame sprang back up around her fist.\nTo the south, an audible crash rose above the artillery and musket fire,\nand she looked to see that three battalions of Adran cuirassiers had just\nslammed into the Kez flank.\nCHAPTER 15\nA\ndamat couldn’t believe what he’d just heard. Field Marshal Tamas\nwasn’t merely alive, he was here?\nTamas must have taken the command from Hilanska. That meant that\nthe Adran forces, including the Wings of Adom, could now present a\nunified front against the Kez.\nAdamat’s heart fell as he dwelt upon that thought. The Kez still\noutnumbered Adro by at least four to one, and now that they battled on the\nopen plains, it would be an easy thing for the Kez to spread their superior\nnumbers and engulf the smaller Adran army.\nThe bulk of the battle was now hidden in the low cover of black\nmusket smoke, obscuring the southern horizon as if an entire city were\nafire. To the southwest, Adamat could see the Adran cuirassiers struggling\nto disengage themselves after a successful charge at the Kez flank. Kez\nauxiliaries were already advancing at a double march to cut off the\ncuirassiers’ escape."

    "text": "to disengage themselves after a successful charge at the Kez flank. Kez\nauxiliaries were already advancing at a double march to cut off the\ncuirassiers’ escape.\nTo Adamat’s horror, the auxiliaries continued to fan out, stretching\nimpossibly far beyond the edge of the Wings’ lines. The Kez must have\nbeen expecting Hilanska to take care of the Wings’ flank, and now that the\nruse had been betrayed, they had commanded several brigades forward to\ntake care of the job.\nAnd they would do so easily. Even if all those auxiliaries were\nuntrained and unequipped, they more than made up for it in bulk. They\nwould collapse the Wings’ right by sheer manpower.\nBeside Adamat, Nila had taken to snapping her fingers, igniting her\narm and then putting it out again with Privileged sorcery. She had stopped\nwatching the battle and seemed completely enthralled in her own\nexperimentation. He noticed that the Wings’ colonel had taken a long step\naway from her, and he did the same. Nila – by her own admission – didn’t\nhave any idea what she was doing, and Adamat didn’t care to find out how\nmany charred corpses it took for most Privileged to figure it out.\nThe Adran cuirassiers finally pulled themselves away from the Kez\nflank and fled before the advancing auxiliaries. They had left an enormous\ndent in the side of the Kez infantry, but their own numbers had suffered, and\nthey retreated to the northwest to lick their wounds.\nThe auxiliaries slowed when they realized they would not catch the\ncuirassiers and swung around to march against the Wings’ flank. Adamat,\neven with his unskilled eye, could see it would end in disaster. He hoped\nthat Tamas was planning on sending more reinforcements to this side,\nbecause it couldn’t get much worse.\nAdamat swore to himself under his breath. Why had he let that thought\nenter his head? Of course it could get worse.\nIt just had.\nA brigade of Kez auxiliaries had just broken off from the main body\nand was marching straight for the camp. Another brigade soon followed,\nand Adamat realized that nothing but the Wings’ colonel and her one\nbrigade of green troops stood between the camp and the Kez.\nEven if they managed a strong defense, it would still be a slaughter.\nThe Kez infantry wouldn’t turn away at the last moment. They would\noverrun the camp defenders, kill any followers, loot and burn the camp, and\nthen turn to attack the Wings from behind.\nThe Wings’ colonel gave a rapid succession of orders. Messengers\nsprinted toward the front, and the companies wheeled from the north to face\nthis new threat.\nAdamat drew his cane sword and clutched it tightly in one hand. He\nimmediately felt silly. What would a cane sword do against musketmen\nwith bayonets fixed? He thought to ask the colonel if there was a spare rifle\nhe could use, but she dashed away suddenly, shouting orders at a nearby\ncaptain.\nThat left Adamat alone with Nila. The girl Privileged was still flicking\nher fingers, sparking blue flames along her arm.\n“What on earth are you doing?”\n“Trying to get this to work,” she answered, not looking up. Another"

Another\nsnap of the fingers and the blue flame erupted around her hand. She shook\nthe flames out with a look of frustration.\n“Do you think this is the best time for that?”\nHe noticed that Nila was paying close attention to where she\npositioned her fingers when she snapped them. Each new try she moved\nthem slightly, and then attempted a quick combination of snaps, rubbing her\nthumb against first her forefinger, then her middle finger.\n“I might not get another chance.”\n“Well, look,” Adamat said. He knew what she was thinking. Make it\nwork. Save everyone with her newfound sorcery. But of course she couldn’t\nlearn to use her sorcery in just a few moments, and the very idea of the girl\ntrying seemed incredibly absurd. As absurd as him standing here with his\ncane sword drawn. “We need to get as far toward the back of the camp as\nwe can. Once the fighting starts, we could make a run for the Adran lines.\nThen we could… Ah!”\nA jet of flame shot from Nila’s hand and traced a finger of blackened\nearth across the ground twenty paces away, nearly setting fire to a nearby\ncorporal.\nNila gave a scream – half startled, half victorious. “I’ve got it!”\n“What? You haven’t got it,” Adamat said. “Do you even know what\nyou did?”\nNila held her off-hand away from herself gingerly, pointing toward an\nopen patch of ground between two nearby tents. She brushed her thumb\nacross her forefinger, then touched it gently to her pinkie. Flame erupted\nfrom her dominant hand – not a thin tendril this time, but a gout that\nseemed to spring up from the ground, setting fire to the grass and rising five\nor six feet in the air, traveling from her to the spot she’d pointed at as if\nfollowing a line of lamp oil.\n“All right,” Adamat said. “I’m impressed.” “Terrified” seemed a better\nword for it, but Adamat didn’t think the girl needed to hear that. She didn’t\nknow what she was doing. Who knew what an untrained Privileged was\ncapable of? She might be able to set fire to the entire enemy army, but could\nshe keep from doing the same to her allies?\nHe wondered if he should head toward the Adran lines. If Tamas was\nback, Adamat would need to report everything that had happened over the\nlast several months. But during a battle wouldn’t be the best time.\nAt least it might get him farther away from the approaching Kez\nauxiliaries.\n“Nila, we should…” He trailed off. The girl was gone. He cast about,\nthen spotted her sprinting, skirts in hand, toward the Wings’ rearguard and\nthe Kez auxiliaries beyond them.\nWhat was she doing? She couldn’t possibly think she could help. She\nwas just rushing off to get herself killed.\nAdamat looked toward the Adran lines. He could make it. The Adran\ncommand tent was less than two miles away. He could get there and report\nto Tamas, and maybe manage to send some help this direction.\nThe girl wasn’t his responsibility. She was Bo’s, and Adamat owed Bo\nnothing."

She was Bo’s, and Adamat owed Bo\nnothing.\nWith a curse, Adamat set off after Nila.\nNila shouldered her way through the line of soldiers preparing to defend the\nWings’ camp and ignored their yells as she scrambled over the fortifications\nand ran toward the enemy brigade.\nA little voice in the back of her head screamed at her to turn around\nand run the other way. What the pit was she doing? She was running\nstraight to her death. Even if she could replicate the fire, she couldn’t\npossibly use it to destroy an entire brigade. She might take a few of them\nwith her, but they’d gun her down and trample her body into the mud. She\nwasn’t going to do any good out there.\nBut she ignored the voice and kept heading toward the enemy.\nThe voice in her head changed tactics.\nYou’re going to try to kill people. These are human lives you’ll be\nending. You’re not a warrior. You’re a laundress. They’ll die in an inferno,\nburned alive, and the screams will haunt you the rest of your life.\nBut, she argued, if I do nothing, then the Wings’ mercenaries will die.\nThe infantry will be overwhelmed and all their noncombatants will be put to\nthe sword.\nThat’s what they’re paid to do.\nNila slowed, no longer convinced she had the strength to do what was\nnecessary. What would Bo say? Wouldn’t he tell her to stop being a coward\nand learn to act like a Privileged? Hadn’t he also said that courage was\noverrated? Contradictory bastard.\nShe suspected that in this situation he would tell her she was an\nuntrained bloody fool about to get herself killed.\nNila came to a stop. She was about fifty yards in front of the Wings’\nlines and the enemy advanced toward her, churning forward like a machine.\nShe could hear the calls of their sergeants and the thump-thump of their\nmarch in time with the drums.\n“Nila!” Adamat snatched her by the arm and pulled her back toward\nthe Wings’ lines. “We have to go.”\nShe shook him off, a terrible weight settling in her stomach. It was too\nlate. The Kez were less than a hundred yards off. The Wings would open\nfire soon, regardless of her presence. She and Adamat would be cut down\nby the barrage. She’d gotten both of them killed.\n“Step back, Inspector,” she said. She dropped her skirt and moved\nforward a couple of paces. She tried to open her body to the Else, the way\nBo had showed her, to make the flow of the sorcery come smoothly. Her\nhands trembled fiercely as she raised them both, with her left hand pointed\ntoward the Kez brigade and her right hand raised above her head. It struck\nher how theatrical the pose was, and that it was completely unnecessary.\nBo would have approved.\nShe brushed her thumb across her forefinger and willed the Else to\nflood the world at her command.\nNothing happened.\nShe had done it wrong. Her hands shook uncontrollably now. It would\nbe impossible to make the proper connection. Her body had betrayed her,\nand now she and Adamat would die for it."

Her body had betrayed her,\nand now she and Adamat would die for it.\nHer breath was suddenly squeezed from her, as if she’d been stuck\nthrough the stomach and lungs with a lance. A gasp tore itself from her lips\nand she fought against the dizziness that followed, and when she thought\nthe pain had become unbearable, fire suddenly showered the world.\nIt spread out from her in a cone like a wave of pestilence, leaving\nnothing but cinders in its wake. She watched it spread toward the enemy\nlines and suddenly, without warning, blackness claimed her.\nAdamat dashed forward just in time to catch Nila as she fell.\nHe watched, stunned, as the wall of flame rolled toward, and then over,\nthe Kez brigade. The screams reached him a moment later, but by the time\nthe flame had washed over the advance elements of the Kez infantry, they\nhad already been silenced. Charred skeletons decorated the landscape,\ntwisted horribly from the heat. When the flames finally died, over three-\nquarters of the brigade had been reduced to ash.\nAdamat pulled his gaze away from the spectacle and lifted Nila in both\narms. She was a small woman, and were he ten years younger, it would\nhave been easy enough to hurry back to the Wings’ lines. As it was, he\nstruggled to trudge back with his burden, feeling every old ache and wound\nas he did.\nSeveral infantry dashed out to help him get over the earthen\nbarricades. One of them took Nila from him.\n“Get her as far away from the fighting as you can,” Adamat said,\nfollowing the soldier back into the camp. They hurried through the tents\nuntil they reached the eastern edge of the camp, closest to the Adran lines,\nand the soldier lay Nila on the ground and sprinted back for the front.\nAdamat held a hand over the girl’s mouth, and then put a finger to her\nneck. It took him a few moments, but he was able to find a pulse – albeit a\nweak one.\nHe ransacked a nearby soldier’s tent for a sleeping pad and blankets\nand made the girl comfortable. He didn’t want to smother her, but it might\nbe a good idea to conceal her, just in case the Kez broke through the enemy\nlines. Once he’d finished with that, he stole an officer’s chair and climbed\non top of it to try to get a view of the battle.\nA perpetual cloud of powder smoke made it impossible to see anything\nin the field to the south. The Adran artillery thumped away without rest, and\ntheir irregulars were moving into position. It couldn’t be going all that well\nif they needed their irregulars already. It looked as though several\ncompanies of Adran infantry had broken away from the front closest to the\nWings and were marching double-time to reinforce the Wings’ camp.\nAdamat was considering Nila’s unconscious body, wondering whether\nhe’d have the strength to carry her all the way to the Adran lines and –\nhopefully – safety, when he turned to the west where Nila had scorched the\nearth with her sorcery.\nThe remnants of the brigade she had burned had turned tail and fled\nwithout hesitation.

From where he was, he could still see them running, and\nit looked like their own officers were shooting them to try to turn them\nback.\nGood for morale, Adamat imagined.\nThe Second Brigade was certainly wavering. Their advance had\nslowed to a crawl and they seemed hesitant to move across the roasted\nremains of their comrades.\nImmense figures – twisted hulks of muscle swathed in black – burst\nfrom the Kez lines and raced across the charred plains toward the Wings’\ninfantry. They brandished pistols and forearm-sized knives and they\nbeckoned to the auxiliaries behind them to follow. Wardens, at least twenty\nof them. They’d tear apart the green Wings infantry all by themselves.\nThe entire brigade of Kez auxiliaries broke into a charge, trampling\nblackened skeletons to dust beneath their feet as they leveled their bayonets.\nAdamat felt a pang of pity for those poor bastards who would be\ncaught in that stampede.\nThe first line of Wings infantry opened fire, dropping several of the\nWardens and wounding a dozen more. The creatures kept their advance\neven through the second volley, and then they were over the earthen\nfortifications and among the Wings troops. They were followed less than a\ndozen heartbeats later by over four thousand auxiliaries. The wave of tan\nuniforms scaled the earthworks and slammed into the barricade of red and\nwhite.\nThe entire scene devolved into chaos.\nThe Wings’ soldiers had managed to hold against the initial charge, but\nalready their officers were falling to the Wardens. Cracks formed in their\ndefenses and they would be overwhelmed within minutes.\nThe Adran reinforcements were coming on quick from the south, but\nthere clearly weren’t enough of them, and they wouldn’t be here in time to\nmake a difference.\nHe found a nearby wagon whose driver had fled, and wrapped Nila\nfirmly in several blankets and shoved her beneath the wagon bed, then\nstacked two empty rifle crates beside it to conceal her presence. He hoped\nnobody lit the wagon on fire. It wasn’t much, but the best he could do on\nthese godforsaken plains.\nThe Wings’ rearguard had held together longer than Adamat expected,\nbut by the time the Adran reinforcements arrived, they were all but spent.\nThe Kez auxiliaries faltered at the initial impact, but their apparent numbers\ngave them courage and, somewhat chaotically, they wheeled to meet the\nnew threat.\nAdamat watched the battle from behind the wagon – no need for\nheroics from an old investigator – sparing a glance at Nila every so often\nwith the hope that she would regain consciousness.\nThe battle turned brutal. The Wings’ rearguard had been brave but\noverly young and they had managed to absorb the shock of the initial Kez\ncharge. The Adran reinforcements, while heavily outnumbered, were\nseasoned veterans. They tore into the Kez auxiliaries without mercy,\nworking in groups to bring down Wardens with their bayonets and keeping\ntheir lines firm despite the confusion of the camp tents.\nThe sky turned dark with clouds of powder smoke, and the air smelled\nof sulfur, stamped mud, blood, and shit.

War cries gave way to wails of the\nwounded, and the sound made Adamat want to crawl under the wagon with\nNila.\nThe fighting turned desperate as the Adran companies slaughtered\nauxiliaries by the dozens and Wardens managed to break the Adran lines.\nThe whole affair seemed to be getting dangerously close to Adamat’s hiding\nspot, and then it was suddenly upon him.\nAn Adran soldier retreated past Adamat’s wagon beneath the\nadvancing bayonets of three Kez auxiliaries. The poor soul tripped on a tent\nline and sprawled on his back, and the three pressed their advantage. They\nwould be on him in a moment’s time.\nAdamat swore at length as he twisted the head of his cane and drew\nout the short sword within. He managed to cross the fifteen paces to the\nnearest of the three Kez without tripping himself and put the blade between\nthe shoulders of the middle one, then turned and stabbed the neck of the\nsecond.\nThe third had already finished scrambling the bowels of the Adran\ninfantryman by the time Adamat finished backstabbing the first two. He\nturned to Adamat, a look of surprise on his face, and then charged with a\nwordless scream, his bayonet dripping gore.\nIt was Adamat’s turn to retreat. He scrambled backward as quick as he\ndared, trying not to end up like the infantryman he’d failed to save. He\nstumbled once and then turned and full-out ran, hoping that not a soul had\nseen him do so.\nHe’d be buggered before he tried to fight a bayonet-armed soldier with\nnothing more than a cane sword.\nThe soldier chased him around the wagon twice before he was scared\noff by a squad of Adran infantry moving in a tight square.\n“Old man!” one of the infantrymen yelled. “Get out of the fight!”\nWhat a stupid thing to say. The fight was everywhere. Adamat opened\nhis mouth for a retort but found himself screaming a warning.\nA Warden slammed into the squad with the force of a cannonball. Five\nof the men were knocked off their feet and the rest wheeled to face the\ncreature, jabbing with bayonets that the creature ignored as if they were\nmere pins. It snatched a rifle from the closest soldier and slammed the butt\nacross another’s face with enough force to send teeth and blood flying. It\ngrabbed another of the soldiers by the throat, crushing his windpipe with a\ncasual squeeze and leaving the man to die of suffocation.\nIt had killed almost half the squad by the time they managed to put the\ncreature down.\nAdamat watched as two of the infantrymen put a bayonet through each\nof the creature’s eyes and pinned it to the ground until it stopped struggling.\nHe realized he’d never actually seen one of these creatures before. Even\nafter it should have been long dead its muscles still moved unnaturally\nbeneath its skin and the mouth opened and closed on its own, swollen black\ntongue lolling out the side of its mouth.\nAdamat felt his heart pumping hard after watching the fight, despite\nnot having even engaged the creature.

He\ncouldn’t imagine the twisted sorcery it took to make one of these things.\nHis contemplation of the corpse was cut short as a spine-numbing\nscreech cut through the air. Adamat whirled just in time to see a black-clad\nWarden bound over the wagon, clearing it by a good two feet, and land\namid the already reeling squad of Adran soldiers.\nIt snatched up one man by the ankle and swung him like a club,\nbashing him into two of the others, then slinging him over one shoulder and\nthrough the air.\nThe lifeless body might have crushed Adamat had he not dove out of\nthe way. He struggled to his feet, one hand searching for his cane sword\nwhile the other held the wagon lip to steady himself. He regained his\ncomposure in time to witness the Warden slaughter the rest of the squad\nwith a broken bayonet.\nThe creature turned toward Adamat, giving him his first clear look at\nit. Once, years ago, Adamat had seen a hairless bear in a traveling circus.\nThis beast more closely resembled that bear than it did a human. It had\nshort black hair and a nasty cut on its cheek, lifting one corner of its mouth\ninto a sneer. It pounded its gnarled fists on the ground like a gorilla and\nadvanced on Adamat.\nAdamat grasped desperately for his cane sword or for anything he\ncould use as a weapon.\nNot that it would help.\nIt moved forward slowly, as if suddenly hesitant, squinting at Adamat\nwith brutish suspicion, thick brow furrowed. What the pit was taking so\nlong? Adamat couldn’t find a weapon. His hands were shaking so hard he\nlikely couldn’t have held one.\nEnd it already, you foul creature.\nThe beast reached for Adamat’s throat and Adamat’s eyes fell on its\nthick, twisted hand. Its right ring finger was missing. A strange detail for\nAdamat to focus on. But then, men did strange things when they looked\ndeath in the eye. Adamat felt his hand touch something – the handle of his\ncane sword. It had fallen on the wagon. He grasped it and prepared to ram\nthe thing as hard as he could into the Warden’s face. It was his only chance.\nHe tensed, ready to swing.\nAnd felt his heart drop into his stomach. Those dull eyes and the\nsorcery-twisted skin suddenly looked all too familiar.\n“Josep?” Adamat heard himself croak.\nThe creature leapt back as if it had been burned. It slammed at the\nground with both hands, baring its teeth at Adamat.\n“Josep, is that you?”\nAdamat didn’t have a chance to hear if the creature answered. Three\nAdran soldiers appeared around the edge of the wagon, their bayonets\nleveled, and charged at the Warden with screams of defiance. It whirled on\nthem, then looked at Adamat, the confusion plain on its face. It took two\ngreat bounds toward the soldiers and leapt, clearing all three of them and\nlanding on the other side to break into a sprint toward the Kez lines."

That was not a fight they would have won.\nAdamat heard a thump, then a decidedly unfeminine curse from\nbeneath the wagon. He tore his gaze away from the fleeing Warden and bent\nover the wagon. “Nila? Are you all right?”\n“I’m fine.” She lay on her back, rubbing her forehead. “Where am I?”\n“I hid you while you were out.”\n“Oh. Sorry, I fainted. I don’t know what came over me.”\n“You may have saved the entire bloody battle,” Adamat said.\nThere was a pause for a few moments. “Did I kill people?”\n“You saved a lot of lives,” Adamat said. There was no good response\nto this. The girl had saved a lot of lives. But violence like that always took\nits toll, both physically and emotionally. It was likely a blessing that she had\npassed out before the screaming started.\n“Thank you,” she said quietly. “And now?”\nAdamat stood up, surveying the scene. The camp was in shambles.\nThe Warden was nowhere to be seen. Yet the fighting had died down and\nthe only men he saw standing wore Adran blues. “Looks like we’ve driven\nthem off.”\n“That’s a relief.”\n“Yes,” Adamat said, sinking against the edge of the wagon. “Yes, it\nis.”\nWhat had he just witnessed? That creature might have – should have –\nkilled him without hesitation. And it hadn’t. Could it be mere coincidence?\nThe missing finger, the familiar lines of the face, the shape of the jaw that\ncame from Faye’s father. Adamat closed his eyes and saw the beast’s face in\nhis perfect memory.\nJosep.\nCHAPTER 16\nN\nila’s entire body tingled.\nIt felt like stepping out of a springless carriage after going down a\nparticularly long and bumpy road. Her legs were weak and her abdomen\nwarm, and everything she touched seemed to crackle slightly. Her mind was\nmuddled, as if her head were jammed full of wool.\nAdamat helped her out from beneath the wagon and she shook her\narms, trying to get rid of the tingle.\n“Are you sure you’re all right?” Adamat asked.\n“My body feels like it’s been stuffed with bees. Is that normal?”\n“No… no, I think not.” Adamat’s reply was wooden. He watched the\nretreating Kez auxiliaries, his face slack.\n“We won?”\nAdamat nodded, but then stopped, as if thinking better of it. “We won\nthat engagement. Barely.” He pointed to the south, where dark clouds of\npowder smoke hung over the battlefield and the thunder of artillery fire\ncontinued almost without interruption. “If not for your sorcery, we would\nhave lost the camp. I imagine Bo will be proud.”\nDistantly, Nila could sense something wrong with Adamat. But she felt\na thrill go through her at that, and a cold knot settled in her stomach. Would\nBo be proud? She could have killed herself. She should have killed herself,"

Bo would be furious. Live to fight another day, he\nwould have said. Don’t take such risks.\nBut did it really matter what he thought? Did she fear some kind of\npunishment? Or did she fear his disapproval?\nNone of that mattered now. She could already hear the eerie moans of\nthe wounded as the adrenaline of the battle wore off and men risked calling\nfor aid. “Adamat, we should help.”\n“Hmm?”\nNila took a hard look at the old investigator. He’d saved her life,\ncarrying her off the battlefield, but he hadn’t asked for thanks. He seemed\nfar away, stunned even.\n“Were you hit on the head?” she asked.\n“No. I don’t think so.”\n“You’re sure? We could get a surgeon to look at you.”\nAdamat patted his chest and arms. “I’m fine. I don’t think I was\nwounded at all, actually.”\n“Just rest here,” Nila said. “I’m going to try to help.”\n“I don’t think that’s such a good idea.” Adamat shook himself and\nseemed to come out of his daze.\n“There are wounded everywhere,” Nila said. “They’ll need as much\nhelp as can be had.” She looked around the camp. Several tents had been set\nalight to the west and Adran soldiers were doing their best to put out the\nfires before they spread. Wagoners tried to wrangle their horses and oxen,\nwhile surgeons rounded up everyone without a weapon to begin moving\nbodies.\nNila headed toward where the Wings’ Fifth Brigade had met the Kez\nauxiliaries for the battle. The chaos and clamor only increased as she neared\nthe battle site. When she passed the tents and approached the earthen\nfortifications, the bodies of wounded and dead of both sides covered the\nground like a carpet. The sight of it all nearly made her sick, but the smell\nwas the worst of it. Blood, sulfur, shit, and gore. She’d visited a\nslaughterhouse once when a cook at the Eldaminse house had been ill. At\nthe time, she’d thought it the most horrific stench she would ever encounter.\nThis was worse.\nThe terrible medley of smells was punctuated by the distinct odor of\ncharred flesh. It clung to her nostrils, permeating the silk handkerchief she\npressed to her face.\nAdamat joined her. He’d lost some of that dazed look in his eyes, and\ngave her a worried glance.\n“It’s hard to comprehend, isn’t it?” he said.\n“Where are all the survivors? Where is the rest of the Wings’ Fifth?”\nNila hurried over to a man calling out for help, but by the time she reached\nhim, his last breath had rattled from his throat. She backed away from the\nbody.\n“Over there,” Adamat said, pointing to a small knot of soldiers, many\nof whom were leaning on their comrades for support.

Adamat pointed to another group, this one looking even more\nragged and disorganized. “And over there. The Kez overwhelmed the entire\nFifth before Adran reinforcements arrived. They’ll be lucky if more than a\nthousand are able to still fight.”\nThree thousand wounded and dead. And that was just among the\nWings. The number staggered Nila. That was the entire staff of the\nEldaminse household a hundred times over.\nNila caught sight of the colonel of the Wings’ Fifth and found herself\nglad that the woman had survived the battle. She still held her saber in one\nhand but had lost her hat, and she clutched her other hand to her thigh as\nshe called out orders. Soldiers began to respond to their officers, and\ngradually the column began to re-form.\n“What are they doing?” Nila asked. “Shouldn’t they be helping the\nwounded?”\nAdamat leaned wearily on his cane. “They’ll round up any Kez\nprisoners and place a few guards, but everyone else needs to be ready in\ncase of another attack. The battle is still far from decided.” He peered\ntoward the smoky southern horizon. “I think.”\nThe idea of having all this slaughter and destruction happen again\nmade Nila’s stomach churn – and she’d been unconscious for most of the\nfirst fight. She struggled to keep down her breakfast. “What in Kresimir’s\nname is that smell?”\n“War,” Adamat said.\n“But… it’s like cooked meat!”\nAdamat raised his eyebrows at her. “I don’t think you…”\nNila’s gaze rested on the blackened ground off to the southwest. It was\nan enormous swath, with little more than ash and dirt, and – was that bone?\nShe blinked slowly at the view, remembering her legs pumping beneath her\nas she ran toward the Kez troops. She recalled the heat of the fire, and the\npain and pleasure of the power that had coursed through her before her\nworld had gone dark.\nThe realization nearly knocked Nila off her feet. That smell of burned\nflesh had been caused by her. She grabbed Adamat by the elbow. “How\nmany did I kill?”\n“Nila, you saved many…”\n“How many did I kill, Inspector?” she demanded. “How many?”\nAdamat looked at her with pity, which somehow made it all the worse.\n“I can’t be sure.”\n“Guess.”\n“You should let go, Nila,” he said, his voice strained.\nNila looked down to find her knuckles white from squeezing Adamat’s\narm. She snatched her hand back. “I’m sorry. Please, tell me how many I\nkilled.”\n“Thirty-five hundred. Maybe more. Maybe less. It looked like you\ntorched the better part of a brigade.”\nNila bent over and heaved, emptying the contents of her stomach in\none long retch. She heaved once more when she realized she had just\nvomited all over a dead man’s legs. She felt Adamat’s hand on her shoulder\nand let him help her up.\n“I can’t… I don’t even…”\n“Stay quiet for now,” Adamat said. They started walking, and Nila had"

They started walking, and Nila had\nno sense of time or space until she looked up to realize they’d left the\nbattlefield and even the Wings’ camp behind and were about a third of the\nway toward the Adran camp.\nShe dragged a sleeve across her face. “Where are we going?” she\nsniffed.\nAdamat’s eyes were fixed firmly on the ground as he walked, and it\nwas several moments before he responded. “To see Field Marshal Tamas.”\n“We should go back and help.”\n“You don’t need to see that right now,” he said sternly.\nShe wanted to fight him. To pull away and run back to the Wings’\ncamp to help with the dead and the wounded. She deserved to see and smell\nthe results of her power. Was she a coward for not doing so?\n“Why the field marshal?” Nila asked.\n“Because I need to report to him, regardless of whether or not we win\nthis battle.”\n“You could have left me behind. I’m not a child. I could help.”\nAdamat stopped and turned to her. She felt him grab her by the\nshoulders, and he waited until she finally looked up into his eyes. There was\na sort of fatherly, stern caring there. It was painful. Couldn’t he see what\nshe was capable of? Didn’t that terrify him?\nIt damn well terrified her.\n“Nila, once there’s any sort of organization in the Wings’ camp, they’ll\ncome looking for you. They’ll either want you to get to the front and fight\nfor them or they’ll realize that you’re not in full command of your powers\nand they’ll try to control you. Either way, I couldn’t leave you alone back\nthere.” Taking her by the arm, Adamat continued walking toward the Adran\narmy.\nNila let herself be dragged along. She breathed in deep – the air was\nclearer here, between the armies, and the scent of sulfur was almost gone\nwith a northerly wind. But that smell of charred flesh still hung in her\nnostrils, as if it had been painted on her upper lip.\nAdamat produced papers from his jacket to show the Adran pickets,\nand they soon went around two companies of irregulars waiting for orders\nand climbed a steep hill to the command tent. Adamat showed his papers\nonce more and asked to see Field Marshal Tamas. One of the guards ducked\ninside and returned a moment later, nodding them forward.\n“Go on in, Inspector. Ma’am.”\nNila followed Adamat inside, only just realizing what she was doing.\nThis was Field Marshal Tamas! She had been his personal laundress for\nmonths, and even been courted by his bodyguard. She had seriously\nconsidered murdering the field marshal. There was no way they could know\nthat, could they? What if Olem was here? How would she explain her\npresence?\nShe scrambled for some excuse to remain outside, but was ushered in\nbefore she could voice any.\nIt was with some relief that she found the tent devoid of both Field\nMarshal Tamas and Captain Olem.

There were a half-dozen messengers\nstanding at attention along one wall, and a large table laid out with maps,\npapers, and notes. The biggest map was covered with hundreds of small\nmilitary models of fifty different sizes and shapes. A young woman in an\nAdran-blue uniform with black hair and a powder keg pinned to her breast\nstood over the table – a powder mage and, from the stripes on her shoulder,\na captain.\nA messenger pushed past Nila and saluted the powder mage. “Two\ncompanies of Kez cavalry have broken around the Seventeenth and are\npushing toward the Hundred and Second Artillery!”\nThe woman moved one of the models on the map and then scrambled\nthrough piles of notes on the table in front of her for several moments\nbefore finding one to her satisfaction. “Send the Seventy-Eighth Irregulars\nto shore up our eastern flank, and tell General Fylo to throw everything he\nhas at the enemy’s left. Those cavalry were the only thing keeping us from\ntaking command of that hill.”\nThe messenger was off like a shot. The woman shuffled several of the\nnotes and then dropped into her seat with a shaky sigh. Her face was drawn\nand pale, and Nila thought she heard a few quiet curses.\n“Captain Vlora, was it?” Adamat asked.\nThe powder mage gave a curt nod. “Inspector Adamat? The field\nmarshal was hoping you’d turn up sometime today.”\n“I’m here to report,” Adamat said. “Where is the field marshal?”\n“He’s not here,” she responded rather crossly.\nThe prospect cheered Nila slightly, until she realized the implication.\n“Where is he?” she asked before she could stop herself.\nVlora peered at her. “You’re Bo’s apprentice? I take it we have you to\nthank for torching the Kez auxiliaries?”\n“Yes.” Nila tried to force a smile, but it felt as limp and cold as a dead\nfish. She let it slide off.\nVlora was already looking back at Adamat. “The field marshal is gone.\nHe’ll be back in a couple of days, if all goes well.”\n“But we were told…” Adamat started, looking somewhat confused. “I\nthought he was here.”\n“He was.”\n“But he’s not now.”\n“Correct.”\n“But the battle. It looks like we’re winning.”\n“I think we are,” Vlora conceded, albeit hesitantly.\n“If Field Marshal Tamas isn’t here, who is in command? Who is giving\norders?”\n“Tamas is in command,” Vlora said, gesturing at the table full of maps\nand notes. “He fought the entire battle yesterday, on paper, and then headed\ntoward the mountains on personal business.”\n“You’re joking,” Adamat said.\n“Not at all.

A rather conspicuous pile of\ngleaming slag lay a few dozen feet from the bodies that had already been\npulled from the rubble. Taniel thought he recognized air rifles, bayonets,\nand knives, all melted together by preternatural forces.\n“You went easy on them,” Taniel said.\n“I asked very nicely,” Bo responded.\n“I wish I could have done that.” Taniel caught Bo looking at him out of\nthe corner of his eye.\n“Well,” Bo sniffed. “I’m a little more persuasive than you. Oi! You\nthere, put your back into it! That boulder isn’t going to move itself.”\nTaniel watched two of the soldiers try to move a boulder off a half-\ncrushed body, and attempted to sort out the emotions warring within him.\nThese men had come to kill him. No question about it. Even the rankers\nknew who they were hunting. Part of him wanted to tell Bo to bury the\nwhole lot along with their crushed comrades. But the blood already on his\nhands took the sting out of his anger.\n“You could help them, you know.”\n“Not a chance,” Bo said.\n“I thought as much. Bo?”\n“Hmm?”\n“What the pit is that?” Taniel pointed down the valley to a brownish-\nred stain on the canyon wall. It looked like someone had thrown a handful\nof wet paint against the stones and left it there to dry in the sun.\nBo tugged gently on his gloves. “I made an example of the first one\nwho tried to bayonet me.”\nAnd splattered him like a grape. Taniel felt ill. “I was wondering why\nthey were all so cooperative. A little messy, don’t you think?”\n“I’ve found that a little messiness is like manure on a field when\nyou’re trying to cultivate fear.”\nTypical Privileged thinking. “Indeed.” Taniel watched the prisoners\nwork at extracting the bodies for a few moments before noticing Bo tug at\nhis gloves again. “You’re nervous.”\n“Not really.”\nBo tugged on his gloves plenty; most Privileged did that. But he had\none leg up on a rock, bouncing it rapidly. He was nervous, even if he didn’t\nwant to admit it. “You are. What is it?”\n“Nothing, nothing. Don’t worry your head about it.”\nTaniel opened his mouth to argue, but he knew he wouldn’t get any\nfurther. Not with Bo. “I’ll go help Ka-poel,” he said. He hurried his way up\nthe narrow path in the canyon wall that led toward the cave where he and\nKa-poel had spent the last two weeks. He found Ka-poel just leaving the\ncave. She had her rucksack slung across her shoulder and had fastened\nstraps from an infantryman’s jacket so that she could hang Kresimir’s\ncasket from her back.\n“I can carry something, if you’d like,” Taniel said.\nKa-poel handed him the rest of the rations they’d stolen from the\ninfantrymen.\n“Anything else?”\nShe laid a hand protectively across her rucksack and furrowed her\nbrow.

And despite the fact that their time in the mountains had been\nhorrible and dangerous, he knew that his chances of being alone with her\nonce they returned to civilization would be slim. There would be fighting to\ndo, reports to give.\nGenerals to kill.\nHe realized suddenly that aside from the edge it would have given him\nin combat, he didn’t miss the powder.\nVery strange.\nThey made their way back down to Bo and his prisoners. Bo lay on his\nback on a flat rock, tossing a pebble up in the air and catching it with one\ngloved hand. He seemed at ease now, even if he was still watching the\nsoldiers carefully.\n“I brought you this,” Bo said as they approached, holding out a powder\nhorn that had been concealed in his jacket. “Forgot to give it to you earlier.\nBut if you open that damned thing near me, I swear to Kresimir I will punch\nyou in the face. Just carrying it gives me a rash.”\nTaniel took the horn and turned it over in his hands. He could sense the\npowder within – the power that it could give him. It would soothe his aches\nand injuries, give him strength for the climb down the mountain. “Where’d\nyou get it?”\n“Stole it from a Wings infantryman on my way to get you.”\n“Thanks,” Taniel said, looping the strap over his shoulder. Privileged\ndidn’t like black powder. They had allergies to the stuff that made\nbattlefields a nightmare. “Really, Bo. I wish I could repay you.”\n“You didn’t shoot me in the head when your dad told you to. I figured\nit was my turn to do something nice for you.” Bo sat up and jerked a thumb\ntoward the infantry. “We should go. I’ve given them a stern talking-to.\nThey’ll finish their work and bring the bodies back to Adopest.”\n“A stern talking-to? You threatened them? I can’t get four squads of\nsoldiers to listen to me when I threaten them.”\n“You can’t pull their veins out of their bodies inch by inch. And if any\nrun, they’ll spend the rest of their lives wondering if I’m around the next\ncorner.” He barked a laugh. “Best punishment I can think of, really.”\n“Ah.”\nBo’s gaze shifted to Ka-poel. “Good to see you again, little sister.\nTaniel knocked you up yet?”\n“You bastard!” Taniel swung halfheartedly for Bo, who stepped deftly\nout of the way.\n“Oh, don’t give me that. I knew you were in love with her that day you\ncame for me on South Pike. Little sister, what have you got… oh dear\nKresimir above!” Bo backpedaled suddenly, leaping away from Ka-poel\nwith agility Taniel wouldn’t have credited him with.\n“What’s wrong?” Taniel asked.\nBo cowered behind a boulder.

He opened his mouth, only for Ka-poel to speed through\na series of hand motions, pointing at Bo and then touching her finger to her\nthroat, then back to him.\nBo licked his lips while he watched her go through the motions again.\n“What I just said?”\nKa-poel nodded.\n“ ‘What have you got…’?”\nKa-poel made a get on with it motion.\n“ ‘Oh dear Kresimir above’?” Bo said.\nKa-poel nodded again.\n“ ‘Kresimir above’?” Bo confirmed.\nOne more nod.\n“You’ve got Kresimir in that box?”\nKa-poel gave him a tight smile. To Taniel’s shock, it looked as if Bo\nbelieved her. Hesitantly, the Privileged worked his way out from behind the\nboulder. He was pale in the face, and he kept Taniel between himself and\nKa-poel as he rejoined them.\n“I could have fixed you up with a nice girl,” Bo said. “A girl from east\nAdopest. Someone who doesn’t go around keeping gods in boxes.”\nTaniel took Ka-poel’s hand. “Not my type.”\n“Of course not,” Bo said bitterly, tugging at the backs of his gloves.\n“Now, can we get moving?”\n“Are you in a hurry?”\n“No,” Bo said as he set off at a brisk pace down the canyon. “Well,” he\ncalled over his shoulder, “yes. A little.”\nTaniel jogged to catch up. “What is it?”\n“Nothing at all. Can the girl get a move on?”\n“Her name is Ka-poel.”\n“Can little sister get a move on? I’m going to need some rest tonight\nand I would prefer to get it in the valley and not in this bloody canyon.”\n“When’s the last time you slept?”\nBo counted silently on his gloved fingers. “Five days?”\n“Pit, Bo, you —”\n“That’s not really important.”\n“Then what is?”\n“I may have left my new apprentice in a war zone. And I killed both\nmy horses getting here in time to save you.”\n“Wait, wait. You have an apprentice?”\n“Very nice girl. The kind I could have set you up with. She has some\npeculiar powers, and I’ve grown quite fond of her. She’s actually the one\nwho figured out where you were. I wouldn’t have left her, except…”\n“Yes, yes. You were coming to save me.”\n“Right.”\nThey continued on in silence for the better part of the afternoon. Taniel\nforced Bo to slow down so that Ka-poel could keep up, and they worked\ntheir way down the canyon. They finally stopped to rest an hour after the\nsun had left their canyon in shadow. Ka-poel dropped Kresimir’s casket on\nthe ground unceremoniously, making Bo wince.\n“Tell me about this apprentice,” Taniel said as they made a meal of\ninfantry rations.\nBo winced as if he had just cracked a tooth on a piece of hardtack."

Blech. My apprentice? Not much to tell,\nreally. Another sorcery slinger. You know.”\n“You said you were fond of her.”\n“Did I?” Bo made a show of gnawing on the brick-hard biscuit.\n“You slept with her already, didn’t you? Isn’t there some kind of code\nof conduct against that type of thing?”\nBo glowered first at Taniel, then rolled his eyes over to Ka-poel, who\nsat on the ground fiddling with a latch on her rucksack.\n“Pole’s not my apprentice!” Taniel protested.\nBo rolled his eyes. “I haven’t slept with Nila.”\n“Oh, she has a name now, eh? And you expect me to believe you\nhaven’t taken her to bed?”\n“… yet.”\n“I see how it is.”\n“And I don’t think I will.”\n“Now, that would shock me,” Taniel said.\n“I’m serious. I like her too much. She’s clever, resourceful. And she’s\ngoing to be far stronger than I ever will.”\n“Really?” Taniel was skeptical. Bo had once boasted that despite being\nthe youngest Privileged in the Adran Cabal, he was one of the strongest.\nTamas had confirmed that boast. For Bo to say something like\nthis…“You’re intimidated by her?”\n“No,” Bo said. “Julene was intimidating. And I went to bed with her.\nNila is just…”\n“You’re intimidated because she’s a better person than you are.”\n“Go to the pit,” Bo said.\nTaniel scowled. He’d just caught sight of something out of the corner\nof his eye. His breath quickened, and he shifted slightly, trying to look to\nhis left without being obvious about it.\n“Well, don’t go all silent suddenly,” Bo said. “I didn’t mean it.”\n“Quiet.” Taniel reached inside his jacket and flicked the cap off of the\npowder horn. Bo saw the action and stiffened. He checked his gloves.\n“What is it?” Bo hissed.\n“I saw a flash of Adran blue. A uniform,” Taniel said. “Farther down\nthe canyon. About thirty yards.”\n“Are you sure?”\nTaniel reached out with his senses. “Yes. I’m sure.” He stood up, and\nBo quickly followed, spinning to look down the canyon.\nA rock tumbled down from a ledge fifty feet above them, then another\non the opposite side of the canyon. An infantryman’s forage cap emerged,\nand Taniel could see the barrel of a rifle. Then another. Then another.\nAll around them, soldiers appeared on the canyon walls. Taniel\nstopped counting at twenty-five. “The rest of the infantry company,” he\nsaid, “the ones camped in the valley. Did you confront them, too?”\n“I didn’t know there were more,” Bo said. “The camp I passed had less\nthan a dozen men in it.”\nTaniel sensed Bo reaching into the Else, and felt sorcery leak into this\nworld.

A breeze – touched with sorcery – lapped around Taniel’s legs and\nruffled his jacket as a dozen more soldiers rounded the bend on the canyon\nfloor, leveling their rifles. “They have gunpowder,” he said. “They’ll have\nto come a little closer for me to detonate them.”\n“No need for that,” Bo said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Do you recognize that insignia?”\nEvery one of the men had a patch on his shoulder – a chevron with a\npowder horn below it. He remembered the same patch on the uniforms of\nthe men who had been guarding him when he awoke from his coma.\nSomeone had told him that they belonged to a special regiment called\nRiflejacks.\n“They’re not pointing their guns at you,” Bo said.\nRiflejacks. That special regiment reported to Field Marshal Tamas’s\nbodyguard.\n“Privileged Borbador,” a voice called. “If you would please remove\nyour gloves.”\nBo’s fingers twitched. Taniel could feel his sorcery tightening, like\nmuscles moving beneath the skin. A wave of conflict flashed across Bo’s\nface and he slowly stepped away from Taniel. From up on the ridge and\ndown in the canyon, every rifle followed him. Taniel remembered the gaes\nthat had held Bo, the one that would have forced him to kill Field Marshal\nTamas.\n“Don’t do it, Bo,” Taniel said. He could see Bo’s arms tense and his\nfingers wiggle in anticipation. Taniel didn’t know what he could do, but this\nwould only end in a great deal of bloodshed if Bo unleashed his sorcery.\nKa-poel suddenly stood up, leaving Kresimir’s casket on the ground.\nShe strode around in front of Bo before Taniel could stop her, and held out\none hand to him.\n“You don’t want to stand there, little sister.”\nKa-poel thrust her hand at him emphatically, palm up.\n“Give her the gloves, Bo. I won’t let them kill you,” Taniel said. And\nhe wouldn’t. He’d kill a hundred of his own countrymen if they came after\nBo. He’d die by his friend’s side if that was what it meant. He stared hard at\nBo until the Privileged gave a barely perceptible nod, acknowledging that\nhe had gotten Taniel’s meaning.\nBo lowered his arms. He glared down the canyon as he plucked at the\nfingers of his gloves and then set them in Ka-poel’s outstretched palm. She\ntook the gloves and walked down the canyon until she reached the Adran\nsoldiers. One of the men examined the gloves in her hands and gave a sharp\nnod, letting her pass.\nShe reappeared a moment later, and she wasn’t alone.\nField Marshal Tamas walked stiffly up the canyon to Taniel. He\nseemed to have aged ten years in the last few months, and looked more frail\nthan Taniel could ever have imagined him. By his gait, he was hiding a\nwound. A bad one.\n“You look like the pit, Dad,” Taniel said.\n“You don’t look a damned sight better,” Tamas said. His back was"

His back was\nrigid, and he examined Bo out of the corner of his eye as one might regard a\ncave lion sitting on one’s porch, before he turned back to Taniel. Taniel took\na deep breath, trying to calm himself. Last he’d heard, his father was\npresumed dead, and though there had been cause to consider his survival,\nTaniel had not had the time to either grieve or rejoice. A torrent of emotions\nrushed through him, and he struggled to hold them all in check, turning his\nface into a blank canvas.\n“Glad to see you still alive,” Taniel said.\nThe old man’s face was impassive. The pinnacle of military discipline.\nBut for the first time since his mother died, Taniel saw tears shining in\nhis father’s eyes. “You too, Captain.”\nCHAPTER 18\nT\namas gave orders to camp in the valley that night.\nHe put Olem in charge of setting up camp, but made the rounds\nhimself, walking slowly through the tents, waving off salutes, and\nreminding the men that they had an early morning and a long ride ahead of\nthem and that they should get some rest. When he had finished, he checked\non the prisoners, then with the sentries.\n“You need some rest, sir.”\nTamas jumped. Taniel stood behind him on the banks of the small river\nthat ran down the center of the valley.\n“I’m all right,” Tamas said.\n“You’ve been fiddling since we stopped to make camp. Losing sleep\nwon’t get us back to the front any faster.”\nTamas glanced at his son. Taniel looked older. Lean from weeks of\nhunger, his cheeks gaunt, he still managed to retain a robust physical\nappearance. He had put on more muscle since the day Tamas had sent him\nup to South Pike with orders to kill Bo. That seemed like a lifetime ago.\nWhat had it been? Six months? Perhaps less?\n“We should have ridden through the night,” Tamas said. He stifled a\nyawn. “I left at too crucial a time.”\nTaniel shifted from one leg to the other. “Sorry to be such an\ninconvenience.”\n“I didn’t…” Tamas turned toward his son, suppressing a frustrated\nsigh. “That’s not what I meant. It’s just, the battle. It was a terrible risk to\nleave it in others’ hands.”\n“You didn’t need to come for me.”\n“Well, I know that now.” Tamas chuckled. Even to him it sounded\nforced. “I should have just left the whole thing to Bo and stayed at the\nfront.”\n“Indecision isn’t becoming of you.” Taniel kicked a rock into the river.\nTamas wished he knew what to say. He’d never been a spectacular\nfather, he knew that. But even he could tell that something had changed\nabout Taniel. Something Tamas couldn’t quite put his finger on. He could\nsense the sorcery clinging to him without even opening his third eye,\nthough it was subtle stuff. Supposedly the work of that savage witch Taniel\nwas so fond of. Tamas had his fair share of questions about that girl."

Tamas had his fair share of questions about that girl.\n“Bo’s not a threat to you anymore,” Taniel said. “You don’t have to\nkeep him tied up, under guard. Give him back his gloves.”\nTamas rubbed at his temples. “It’s just until we get back.”\n“If we get back,” Taniel said, “and we need Bo’s help against the Kez\n– which we will get. A little trust will go a long way.”\n“I’m short on trust right now,” Tamas said. He rubbed at the wound\nthat was itching beneath his coat. Only the constant buzz of a powder trance\nkept the pain away, and only just barely.\n“Hilanska,” Taniel said.\nTamas cleared his throat to cover his surprise. “How did you know?”\n“When Kresimir captured me, he had Hilanska confirm my identity. I\nknow he was the one who sent those bastards.” He jerked his chin toward\nthe makeshift stockade in the center of the camp that contained around a\nhundred and fifty of Hilanska’s men.\nTamas considered it for a moment, then unbuttoned his jacket. He\nlifted his shirt, exposing his flesh to the chill of the night. “Stabbed me right\nbetween the ribs.”\n“Looks bad.” Taniel inspected the wound from a respectful distance,\naware how much his father’s vulnerability meant to him.\n“I’m lucky. It was a clean wound. Missed anything important.” He let\nhis shirt fall and slowly buttoned up his jacket.\n“You need a Privileged to look at it.”\n“The Deliv king has a few healers with him. I’ll get it taken care of\nwhen he arrives. It won’t kill me before then. Hilanska. That bloody\nbastard. We’ve been friends for decades. He was a groomsman at my\nwedding. Was privy to all my plans with the coup.”\n“That’s the wound that won’t heal,” Taniel said quietly.\nTamas didn’t trust himself to say anything else, but allowed a nod.\nWhen they’d stood for several more minutes, Tamas said, “I could use\nMihali. Hah. I can’t believe I just said that. Madman chef-god. I don’t\nbloody well know what I’m going to do without him.” Tamas felt moisture\nin the corner of his eyes. They must have been watering from the cold\nbreeze.\n“Mihali,” Taniel said. “He…”\n“You met?” Tamas supposed he shouldn’t be surprised. Mihali had his\nfingers in every pie.\n“Yes. He said that I was different now. Thanks in part to Ka-poel’s\nsorcery and in part to my contact with Kresimir.”\nTamas remained silent. If Taniel was going to talk, he was going to do\nit on his own. No amount of prompting would get it out of him.\nA few more moments passed, and Taniel said, “Mihali thinks I’m like\nJulene now. Or at least the powder mage equivalent of a Predeii.”\nTamas ground his teeth at the mention of Julene. So many traitors. So\nmuch betrayal. How could Taniel be anything like her? “You can’t take"

How could Taniel be anything like her? “You can’t take\nanything Mihali said seriously.”\n“I think he’s right,” Taniel said. “I barely ate anything up on that\nmountain, but I wasn’t very hungry. I didn’t have any powder, but I could\nstill see details at a hundred yards – nothing like with the powder, but my\nnight vision and hearing and smell are all better than they were.” He looked\nat Tamas and his eyes were suddenly red. “I tore the jaw off of a man.\nWithout any powder! I tore out a Warden’s rib and killed him with it. Well,\nthat time I did have powder.”\n“Pit,” Tamas breathed.\nTaniel snorted. “I know. I’m damn hard to kill, too. I still bleed, but\nI’m stronger, faster. Kresimir ordered his men to break my arm. They\ncouldn’t. I’ve changed, Dad, and it’s terrifying. And Mihali is dead and Ka-\npoel can’t speak, so I can’t learn what is happening to me.” Taniel stared\ndown at his hands. His voice was raw.\n“Taniel,” Tamas said. He gripped Taniel’s arm in one hand. “Listen to\nme. Whatever it is that’s happening to you, you’ll survive it. You’re a\nfighter.” You’re my son, he added silently.\n“But what if it’s not worth surviving?”\nFor a moment Taniel wasn’t a man but the frightened boy Tamas had\nheld after Erika’s death. Tamas grabbed Taniel’s shoulders and roughly\npulled him into an embrace. “It’s always worth surviving, son.”\nThey remained that way for several minutes. Finally, Taniel pulled\naway and wiped his sleeve across his nose. Tamas let out a shaky breath and\nhoped Taniel didn’t see his own tears.\n“Dad.”\n“Yes?”\n“I shot Kresimir in the eye. And then, when he caught me at the old\nfortress, I punched him in the face.”\nTamas stared at his son for a moment, shocked by the absurdity of it\nall. It started as a twitch deep in his stomach, then he threw back his head\nand roared with laughter. Taniel joined him a moment later, and they\nlaughed until the tears streamed down their faces and Tamas forced himself\nto stop because his wound hurt so badly. When they regained their\ncomposure, they stared at each other for some time.\n“I’m sorry for what I’ve been,” Tamas said. The words hurt to leave\nhim, yet he simultaneously felt a great weight lifted. He watched the side of\nTaniel’s face for some kind of response, but Taniel was suddenly guarded.\nHe turned and Tamas was afraid he’d walk away.\n“You have a lot of children,” Taniel said, indicating the camp with a\nwave of his arm. “All your soldiers.”\n“Only one of them matters.”\n“They all matter. Dad, can you do me a favor?”\n“Of course.”\n“Forgive Vlora.”\nTamas raised his eyebrows. He hadn’t known what to expect, but that\nwasn’t it.

He ran a hand through his hair, feeling the scar from the bullet\nthat had grazed his skull at the Battle at Kresimir’s Fingers. “That might\ntake me a little while.”\n“Just try.”\n“I will.”\n“Thanks. And Dad? Ka-poel is carrying around the effigy of Kresimir\non her back. She’s the only thing keeping him from killing all of us.”\n“She’s what?”\n“And there’s something else.” Taniel drew a shaky breath. “I’m in love\nwith her.”\nTamas snuck into the main Adran army camp a day later like a man who’d\nlost the keys to his own front door.\nIt wasn’t a grand entrance, he reflected, as Olem showed a set of\norders to a sentry and Tamas kept the brim of his hat down over his face,\nhiding behind the lapels of his overcoat. But Tamas didn’t need a grand\nentrance. He needed quite the opposite.\nThe sentry looked over the paper for a moment, squinting to read it in\nthe pale morning light, her lips moving silently. They were orders that\nTamas himself had written, with his own signature at the bottom. When she\nfinished, she handed the paper back to Olem and glanced suspiciously at\nTamas. “Looks like everything is in order,” she said, waving them past.\nTamas gave a small sigh as they headed into the camp and lost\nthemselves among the tents to throw off any suspicious guards that may\nhave followed. He would have wanted his men to do a more thorough\nsearch of strangers – they were trained not to put up with any of this cloak-\nand-dagger bullshit that officers from the nobility had always seemed to\nlike. But on the other hand, Tamas was glad to get in without being\nquestioned further.\nThe camp was beginning to stir, the men climbing from their tents,\nbrewing coffee over the coals of their cook fires, laundresses working their\nway through the camp to return clean uniforms. He and Olem discarded\ntheir overcoats and slipped the last hundred yards up to the command tent.\nOnly a few men were about, and those that recognized him shook off their\ngrogginess and snapped salutes.\n“Morning, sir.”\n“Morning.”\n“Fine bit of work the other day, sir. I meant to congratulate you earlier,\nbut haven’t seen you.”\n“Thank you. Carry on,” Tamas said, gesturing a lieutenant back to his\nbreakfast. He leaned over to Olem and whispered, “Well, I assume we won\nby the fact that the army is still intact.”\nA captain interrupted him with a salute and a “Good morning.”\n“Congratulations on the victory, sir,” the woman said. “Sending the\nHundred-and-First up the center like that was inspired work.”\nTamas nodded politely, and when they’d passed her, he continued,\n“And it seems none have been the wiser.”\n“Well done, sir,” Olem said, cracking a smile. He had been in hysterics\nover the idea of leaving to fetch Taniel, and Tamas might have never done it\nif Vlora hadn’t shouted down Olem’s objections. “I suppose you can say"

He and Olem reached the command tent a moment later and the\nguards snapped off their salutes, one holding the tent flap while they slipped\ninside.\nThe white walls of the tent allowed enough light in for Tamas to see\nseveral figures. Vlora, he expected. She lay across several chairs, her boots\non the ground beside her, snoring lightly. The others Tamas had not\nexpected. Brigadier Abrax snoozed on a chair beside the door, her hat\ntipped over her face and chin resting on her chest, while Inspector Adamat\nmumbled in his sleep from his spot on the ground. Someone else was curled\nup in the corner, a mess of curly auburn hair spread out over her blanket.\n“Captain,” Tamas said. No response from Vlora.\nOlem leaned over her. “Vlora.” He nudged her knee, then gently\ntouched her cheek. She startled awake and blinked groggily at Olem, and\nthen at Tamas.\n“Sir,” she said, getting to her feet and managing a less-than-snappy\nsalute.\n“At ease, Captain,” Tamas said. He looked at Abrax. Maybe they\nshould step outside. He really didn’t want to wake her. These things were\nbest done one at a time. “How did everything go?”\nVlora rubbed the sleep from her eyes. “Quite well, sir. The Kez fell for\nour trap completely. We were able to surprise them with our offensive,\nwhile the Wings held off theirs. It was a decisive victory. It went almost\nexactly as you said.”\n“Almost?”\n“I had to improvise a few times. I’ve written a full report. It’s on your\ndesk.”\n“I look forward to reading it.” And I better do so soon, if we’re to keep\nup the farce that I was here the entire time giving orders myself.\n“Casualties?”\n“Fifteen thousand one hundred and seventy-four.”\nTamas staggered at the number. So many? That was a fourth of his\narmy, not counting the irregulars. “Pit,” he said.\n“The regimental breakdown of the losses is also on your desk.”\n“And the Kez?”\n“They’ve retreated all the way to Fendale.”\n“Their losses?”\n“We can’t be entirely sure yet, sir, but we estimate around ninety\nthousand. We’ve captured about twenty-five thousand.”\nTamas felt some of the tension drain from his body. “That’s\nsignificant.”\n“It is, sir. Congratulations.”\nTamas allowed himself a deep breath and some hope for this war.\n“Thank you for staying here.”\nVlora looked down at her feet. “It’s the least I could do after fighting\nto have you go after Taniel. I did the best I could.”\n“I think you were equal to the task.”\n“Just following your orders. Sir?”\n“My mission was successful, Captain, if that is what you’re asking.”"

    "text": "“I think you were equal to the task.”\n“Just following your orders. Sir?”\n“My mission was successful, Captain, if that is what you’re asking.”\nVlora gave a none-too-subtle sigh of relief. Tamas wondered what she\nwould feel about Taniel’s declaration of love for the savage – for Ka-poel.\nHe had advised that his son keep it under his hat for a while longer, but\ntruth be told, Tamas didn’t know what he thought of it. Not something he\nhad the luxury to deal with right now. He glanced at the piles of papers on\nhis desk. He would have to scour everything in there to learn the details of\nthe battle. If Vlora had made mistakes, it would be his own fault for leaving\nher here alone.\n“You selfish, foolish prig!”\nThe voice broke angrily through Tamas’s thoughts. He whirled to find\nAbrax awake and on her feet. She advanced toward him and stopped an\narm’s length away and thrust a finger out. Tamas felt himself shrink back\nslightly. She was not a large woman by any means, but with her ire up she\ncould be imposing. She jabbed him in the chest.\n“What kind of damned idiocy has gotten into your head, Tamas? How\ncould you do this to us? To me? To your entire army?”\n“Do what?” he asked mildly.\nShe sputtered. “You abandoned us on the eve of a decisive battle. You\nleft a captain in charge of your army and ran off with an entire company of\nyour best soldiers – for what?”\n“For my son.”\n“For one man’s life! I thought you were a leader, Tamas.”\n“I have responsibilities to more than just this country,” Tamas said. He\ncould feel his initial fear turning to anger. Part of him understood Abrax’s\nanger, but to harangue him in front of his men? To criticize him for trying,\nonce in his life, to be a good father?\n“The country is your only responsibility, Tamas. You can’t afford to be\na father. You gave that up years ago when you decided to overthrow your\nking.”\nTamas’s hands shook at his side and he ground his teeth together\nviolently. Everyone in the tent had their eyes locked on Tamas and the\nWings’ brigadier. Vlora looked shocked by Abrax’s outburst, while Olem\nhovered nearby with a hand on his sword. “I never gave it up,” he growled.\nAbrax sniffed at him. “You did.”\n“We won this battle. And you’re furious about it?”\n“I’m furious that you risked everything. Once battle had joined, I\nspread the word that you returned. I personally told my officers that you\nwould lead us to victory. Morale soared. They thought you were here,\nissuing every command yourself. You made a liar out of me.”\n“Countries rise and fall on bigger lies than that,” Tamas said. “And\nthose were my orders. I had returned, and I did give you a victory.”\n“Semantics!” Abrax spat.\nTamas thrust his finger at the table in the middle of the room, which\nwas covered in his maps and notes. “I fought the entire battle the day before\nit happened.

And we still won.” Tamas felt a trickle of sweat go down his\nspine and hoped that Vlora had, in fact, been honest with how well he’d\npredicted the battle. “I did all of that in a single afternoon. I fought my way\nacross bloody Kez, through betrayal and death to get back here.” Tamas\nchoked as he remembered the night he thought he had lost Gavril, riding\nhard across the plateau south of Alvation. “I would have won this war\nalready had I not been beset by treachery.”\n“You’re such a bloody genius,” Abrax said, her lips twisted in disgust.\n“You can fight the rest of the war on your own. I’m going to recommend to\nLady Winceslav that the Wings of Adom cancel their contract and withdraw\nour forces. Or what is left of them.” Abrax brushed past him and stormed\nfrom the tent before Tamas could respond.\nTamas stood in silent shock, until Olem took him by the shoulder.\n“Sir?”\n“I’m all right.” He stumbled to a chair and sat down. The exhaustion of\nmonths of riding, fighting, desperation, and anxiety seemed to catch up with\nhim all at once and he found that his strength was gone. His eyelids felt\nweighed down by lead shot. What had he done? If the Wings abandoned\nhim now, could he finish this war?\nSomeone cleared his throat.\nTamas looked up to find Inspector Adamat holding his hat, looking\nrather embarrassed to have witnessed the fight between him and Abrax.\n“In a moment, Inspector. Vlora, what were the losses to the Wings of\nAdom?”\nVlora shifted from one foot to the other. She’d not yet put on her\nboots, Tamas noticed absently. “A little less than twenty thousand.”\n“Ah, pit. No wonder Abrax was so angry. That’s almost half of their\nforces wounded or killed.”\n“They took the brunt of the attack, sir. Just like you planned.”\n“Just like I planned. Of course.” His thought had been to let the\nmercenaries earn their pay. And they had, many times over, it seemed. They\nweren’t his men. They were Abrax’s, and she had the right to be furious that\nTamas had used them for a millstone. “Inspector. How did the affair with\nLord Vetas go? Is your family safe?”\n“Lord Vetas is dead,” Adamat said. “And thank you for asking, sir. We\nwere able to rescue all but” – he paused to clear his throat – “my oldest\nson.” Adamat looked as weary as Tamas felt. There were large black bags\nbeneath his eyes and the little hair on his balding head was mussed from\nsleeping on the ground.\n“I’m sorry for your loss.”\n“Thank you, sir. Our expedition against Lord Vetas was a success. We\neven captured many of his papers and men, but, I’m afraid, it was all in\nvain. You’ve been told that Lord Claremonte holds Adopest?”\n“That’s what I was told. But one thing at a time. We still have to throw\nthe Kez from our lands. Write up a report for me —”\n“I have.”"

I’ll read it and we’ll talk before the day is over. You’re free\nto roam the camp, but I’d greatly appreciate it if you’d stay close until I\nknow everything I need to about Claremonte.”\n“I’m afraid I’ll be of little help there, sir.”\n“Every little bit counts. Now I would…” Tamas stopped himself.\n“Miss, could you come here?”\nThe girl with the curly red hair slowly stepped away from the corner.\nAt first glance she seemed shy, but upon further examination Tamas\nrecognized wariness, like an animal sniffing the air to identify a friend or\nfoe.\n“Nila?” Olem suddenly exclaimed.\n“Hello, Captain,” the girl said, giving Olem a small smile.\n“What are you doing here?”\n“You’re the laundress!” Tamas blurted out as the memory caught up to\nhim. “The one who disappeared with the Eldaminse boy.” He narrowed his\neyes. “Where the pit did you get to? And what are you doing here?”\nNila curtsied and then folded her hands behind her back. “Field\nMarshal,” she said, “I did not steal away the Eldaminse boy. Not precisely.\nWe were both captured by Lord Vetas, and escaped when Adamat attacked\nVetas’s compound. The inspector will corroborate my story.”\n“Is that so, Inspector?”\nAdamat gave a nod, albeit hesitantly. “I don’t know the whole of it, sir.\nBut she’s an honest girl.”\nTamas leaned back. Every vein in his head seemed to throb, and the\npain from the wound at his side had surfaced through his powder trance.\nThere was so much that needed to be done. Could he allow himself any\nrest? He looked cautiously at Vlora and Olem out of the corner of his eye.\nOlem’s brow was furrowed as Vlora regarded the whole affair with a look\nof bemusement. Tamas wondered if she knew that Olem had courted the\ngirl just a few months ago. But then, the two of them were over, weren’t\nthey?\n“So she’s with you?” he asked Adamat.\n“No sir,” Adamat said, coughing into one hand.\nTamas raised his eyebrows at the laundress. “Well?”\n“I’m Privileged Borbador’s apprentice, sir,” Nila said with another\ncurtsy.\n“You’re a Privileged?” Olem asked.\n“Yes. Field Marshal, if I may ask? Where is Borbador?”\n“Ah,” Tamas said. He forced himself to get to his feet. “That’s another\nimportant matter. Adamat, I understand you were witness to Privileged\nBorbador ridding himself of his gaes – the one that compelled him to kill\nme.”\n“That is true. I saw him remove the gem with my own eyes.”\nTamas felt the relief of another small weight being lifted from his\nshoulders. “Good. Thank you, Inspector. Olem, would you show Nila to her\nmaster and release Bo from our custody? They are allowed to leave, but I\nwould be grateful if Borbador would come and see me before he does.”"

They are allowed to leave, but I\nwould be grateful if Borbador would come and see me before he does.”\nOlem escorted Nila out of the tent, and at a nod from Tamas, Adamat\nfollowed them out. Tamas found a seat once again and lowered himself into\nit with a sigh.\n“Sir,” Vlora said, “you should get some rest.”\nTamas leaned back, pressing one palm to the wound at his side, and\nclosed his eyes. “We have work to do.”\n“You’ve earned the rest, sir. If you don’t mind me saying so.”\n“Not quite yet.”\n“What do you intend to do?”\nTamas opened one eye. Vlora was lacing up her boots. “I’m going to\ndrive the Kez from my country once and for all. I’m going to break their\narmy and then I’m going to break their king. And then we’ll see about this\narmy that holds Adopest.”\nCHAPTER 19\nN\nila and Olem wound their way through the camp with silence between\nthem, Olem greeting men as he walked, saluting officers, and nodding to\ninfantrymen. Nila was still fuzzy-headed, the smell of an officer’s breakfast\n– ham and eggs, if she wasn’t mistaken – made her stomach growl. She had\nnot slept well in two days, her dreams haunted by the screams of the dying,\nthe report of artillery fire, and the smell of burned flesh.\n“You understand that it’s vital the men think that Tamas was here for\nthe entire battle,” Olem said, his voice low.\nThese were the first words he’d spoken to her since they left the tent.\nShe felt her emotional defenses pull tight, and quickly said, “Of course. I\nwon’t say a word.” What were they talking about again? Oh yes, Tamas’s\nabsence. What did it matter if Tamas had been gone for the battle, if they\nhad won? The mercenary brigadier seemed angry enough about it.\n“Thank you.” Olem stopped them near the edge of the camp, out of\nearshot of the closest sentries, and looked off into the predawn darkness.\n“They should be here anytime now.”\n“Who?”\n“Our expedition. We took two hundred men with us to find the field\nmarshal’s son. We found him, Privileged Borbador, and over a hundred\nprisoners. Once we had secured the prisoners and made sure Taniel was\nsafe, I and the field marshal rode ahead to sneak into the camp to make it\nlook like we’ve been here the whole time. The rest will be along shortly.”\n“Won’t word get out? If two people know a secret, everyone else does\ntoo.” Nila remembered a time at the Eldaminse house when one of the\nmaids had been caught sleeping with the head butler – caught by the\nbutler’s wife. They’d tried to avoid a scandal by keeping it quiet, but the\nmaid gossiped and the butler was dismissed.\nOlem removed a rolling paper from his jacket and began to roll a\ncigarette. “Of course. Rumors will spread. But as you said, we won the\nbattle and it doesn’t really matter now. As long as the Wings don’t decide to\nmake an issue of it, it’ll stay nothing more than rumor.”"

As long as the Wings don’t decide to\nmake an issue of it, it’ll stay nothing more than rumor.”\nHe finished rolling his cigarette and held it out to her.\n“No thank you.”\nHe nodded and lit it with a match, smoking silently. Nila examined the\nside of his face and wondered what he had gone through during the last\nseveral months. She had thought him dead when she heard about the field\nmarshal being caught behind enemy lines. But here he was, and didn’t seem\nmuch the worse for the wear – a new scar above one eye, his beard longer.\nIt was strange to think he had courted her. Had things gone differently,\nthey might have become lovers.\nShe clung to that bit of nostalgia to silence the voices in the back of\nher head – the voices of all those men she’d murdered in a wave of fire.\n“You’ve certainly come a long way in life in the last few months,”\nOlem said suddenly.\nNila ducked her head. “And you. I heard someone call you a colonel.\nCongratulations.”\n“That’s temporary,” Olem said.\n“Oh? They can do temporary promotions?”\n“It’s not that. The field marshal wants me to remain a colonel. I just…”\n“You don’t think you can do it?”\nOlem ashed his cigarette and rubbed out the embers with his boot. “It’s\nnot for me. But you? A Privileged! That’s incredible. I always thought you\nwere more than a laundress.” He gave her a smile, and the crack in his\nfaçade revealed a deep exhaustion.\n“Laundering is a good job,” Nila said, somewhat more defensively\nthan she’d meant to. She cleared her throat. “Is that why you courted me?\nBecause you thought I was something more? A spy, perhaps?” Had his\ninterest been fake? She wanted to feel angry at the thought, but found she\ndidn’t have the energy.\nOlem took a drag on his cigarette and looked her in the eye. “Not a\nspy.” He cleared his throat, then added, “I’m glad you’re a Privileged. We’ll\nneed you before this is all over.”\nNeed her to do more killing, he meant. The suggestion brought on a\nwave of nausea. Nila could still see the blackened skeletons, could still\nsmell the smoking human remains.\n“Ah. Here they come,” Olem said, saving Nila from having to respond.\nA train of mounted men came into sight over a rise, holding torches and\nlanterns. They paused before the sentries and were waved on and ten\nminutes later they reached Nila and Olem.\nOlem called to ask how the mission had fared. A major responded that\nthey had succeeded, and a cheer went up among the group. Nila heard one\nof the sentries call to another.\n“Taniel Two-shot is alive! He’s come back!”\nThe word spread like wildfire and Nila couldn’t help but smile at the\ncheers that erupted a few moments later from the camp behind them. Taniel,\nit seemed, was well loved.\nA man rode up to Olem. His hair was dirty, a black beard concealing\nhis weary, pinched face. His skin was a patchwork of bruises and scars. He"

He\nwore an Adran jacket over his shoulders, a powder keg insignia pinned to it.\nTaniel Two-shot, Nila presumed. In the saddle behind him was the most\nstriking girl Nila had ever seen.\nShe was a savage, her pale skin splattered with ashen freckles, her\ncropped hair red enough to match the torchlight – a far brighter shade than\nNila’s own auburn curls. While the man gave Nila a curious glance and then\nlooked past her to Olem, the girl caught her gaze and held it for a moment\nbefore giving her a wink and a mischievous smile.\nThe man nodded to Olem, and Olem said, “You better go see your\nfather. You’ll want to know he’s given orders for Bo to go free.”\nTaniel gave a relieved sigh and flicked his reins. His companion\ntwisted in her saddle to look back at Nila and Nila watched her in return\nuntil they disappeared into the camp.\n“So that’s the field marshal’s son?” she asked.\nOlem sucked on his cigarette. “It is.”\n“And the girl?”\n“Ka-poel.”\n“She’s a savage sorceress? I’ve heard rumors about her.”\n“Yes.” Olem crushed the butt of his cigarette beneath his boot. “She is,\nas the field marshal put it, something else entirely.”\nNila saw Bo a little way down the line. He was surrounded by soldiers,\nhis suit rumpled and his hair disheveled. She wanted to run to see how he’d\ngotten on, but the sting of being left behind – in a war zone, no less – rooted\nher feet to the ground.\n“Hello, Nila,” Bo said jovially as he rode up. He gripped the saddle\nhorn with both hands and it became quickly apparent that they were tied\ntightly. The two big Adran infantrymen closest to him didn’t take their eyes\noff him. “Hello, Olem.”\n“Privileged,” Olem said with a nod.\n“Am I allowed out yet?”\nOlem nodded to the men watching Bo, and he was soon dismounted\nand untied, rubbing the feeling back into his wrists. One of the guards\nhanded him back his gloves, which he took without a fuss, and Bo and Nila\nwere soon left alone.\n“Well,” Bo said. He put the gloves into his pocket and nodded, as if to\nhimself. “Glad that’s over. Where are we bunking down? And I’m\nfamished, let’s go —”\nNila put her whole arm behind the slap. She felt the impact all the way\nto her shoulder and into her frame, and it spun Bo half around again. There\nwas an audible gasp from over a dozen soldiers who had seen it.\nBo held his cheek and stared at her. The thought that she’d just slapped\na Privileged with every ounce of her strength made her knees a little weak,\nbut she whispered to herself that she was a Privileged too, now. For good\nand for ill.\n“What the pit was that for?” Bo demanded.\n“For leaving me in a war zone.”"

You look fine! What the pit are you so mad\nabout?”\n“I…” Nila’s voice suddenly caught in her throat. The image of charred\nbits of bone and flesh floated before her eyes, and her fingertips tingled –\nand not just from the slap. She could still feel the flow of the sorcery\nthrough her, the terror and the ecstasy as she became a conduit for\ndestructive forces. Her vision swam.\nBo caught her as she swayed. He led her away from the dismounting\nsoldiers, holding her by the elbow, and when he spoke, the anger in his\nvoice was replaced by concern.\n“What happened?”\nShe shook her head, knowing she must look the fool. Her cheeks\nwould be red, tears streaking down her face. This wasn’t how a Privileged\nbehaved. She felt Bo put a hand on either side of her face as he forced her\nto look him in the eyes. “What happened?” he asked again.\n“I killed them.” Her voice sounded so pitiful, and she hated herself for\nit.\n“Come on.” Bo took her by the hand. He led them through the camp\nwith his arm around her, shielding her from onlookers as a brother might\nshield his grieving sister. She remembered him asking questions, and her\nblubbering out the answers, and soon they were back in her tent. He lit a\nlantern and hung it from the cross pole. “Tell me,” he said.\nNila had managed to regain her composure, and after a few deep\nbreaths she began. “I was back with the baggage and the Kez managed to\nmake a run at us. There were a lot of men – they outnumbered the men\nguarding the baggage. I was so angry that I couldn’t do anything. I just kept\ntrying and trying to make the connection.” She mimed snapping her fingers,\nbut was sure not to let them touch. “I thought if I could make fire, I could\nhelp, and suddenly I did. The right gesture and it flowed from me so easily.\nI ran out in front of the defenders and I just let loose.”\n“Fire?” Bo asked quietly.\nShe nodded. “It was like watching a wave roll across the plains. I tried\nto control it, but it just grew and grew and then I passed out.” Nila felt the\ntears coming again. “When I woke up, the inspector had dragged me to\nsafety. He tried to hide the truth from me, but I saw the scorched plain from\nafar. I killed them.”\nBo produced a flask from his pocket and handed it to Nila. She took\nseveral swallows gratefully.\n“Passing out is common when you draw too much power and don’t\nproperly control it,” Bo said. “It’s the body’s defense against destroying\nyourself with the Else. How many?”\n“How many what?”\n“Did you kill.”\nNila looked away. “Thousands.” When she looked up, she expected\nher own self-loathing to be apparent on Bo’s face. After all, she was a"

After all, she was a\nmonster, wasn’t she? She had murdered so many with just a few gestures.\nInstead, Bo’s eyebrows were raised. “Bloody good show, girl!”\nShe punched him in the shoulder.\n“Ow. No, I mean it. That’s amazing. You saved the entire Wings\nbaggage camp, probably thousands of lives, all by yourself.”\nShe stared at him, uncomprehending. “Can’t you see how horrid that\nis? So many lives gone in an instant! They didn’t even get the chance to\ndefend themselves!”\n“Nila,” Bo said, his expression sobering, “you did an incredible thing.\nYou can’t blame yourself for that.”\n“But I do! Are you so insulated against death? Are you so hard of heart\nas not to realize what terrible power we hold in our hands?” She held her\nhands out to him, silently willing him to cut them off. Her cheeks were cold\nwith tears, and suddenly she felt frigid. She began to shiver.\nBo frowned at her for a moment, then sighed. He took the blanket off\nher cot and pulled it around her shoulders, then moved closer to her. He\ntook her by one hand, stroking her fingers as he spoke softly.\n“They made me kill my first when I was fourteen,” he said. “Some\nslave they’d brought in for the purpose – illegal, I know, but legality means\nvery little in a royal cabal. She was probably around seventeen. The olive\nskin of a Gurlish, with one droopy eye.” Bo sniffed. “I refused to kill her\nfour times, and they beat me soundly each time I did. Then, the fifth time,\nthey told me that if I didn’t kill her, I would be a dead man myself. I still\nrefused, and they told me that if I didn’t kill her, they would slaughter\nTaniel and Tamas and Vlora. My only friends. Bloody idiot that I was, I\nbelieved them. I couldn’t let that happen and so when they asked again, I\nkilled the slave girl as quickly as I could.”\nThere was the streak of a tear on Bo’s face. He wiped it away when he\nnoticed Nila was looking at him.\n“Why would they make you do that?” she asked. The cruelty of it\nastonished her. To make a fourteen-year-old boy murder in cold blood?\n“To harden me. To show me what life in a royal cabal is really like. I\ntried to run away seven, maybe eight times. They beat me a lot for that. I\nwas the magus’s own apprentice and he said he wasn’t going to let my\ntalent go to waste just because I was weak-willed. Pit, I hated that man. I\ndid everything I could to make his life miserable: embarrassed him in\npublic, started bedding his own concubines by the time I was sixteen. I even\ntook a shit in his bed once.” Bo chuckled. “And every bruise he gave me,\nevery markless, sorcerous torture they inflicted on me, I used to reinforce\nmy hate. I even swore to kill him, but Tamas took care of that for me.”"

I even swore to kill him, but Tamas took care of that for me.”\nNila felt hollow inside, her energy and emotions sapped. “Is that what\nI’m to become? Someone driven by hate and self-loathing?”\n“Hey now,” Bo said. “I’ve never been driven by my self-loathing. I\nkeep that locked up tight in the back of my head.”\nNila felt the corner of her cheek lift at the joke.\n“No,” Bo went on. “I don’t want you to become that. I want you to\nlearn to wield your power and to follow your conscience. But sometimes,\nyour conscience will require you to kill. That is the life of a Privileged. The\nburden of such power is to protect your friends and countrymen.”\nNila felt herself nodding. She couldn’t find any words.\n“It’ll get easier,” Bo said. He gave her a reassuring squeeze. “Don’t\nbecome callous, though. Don’t become like me. You must do your best to\nprevent that.”\nShe felt his hand move down her side. “Was any of that true?”\n“Pardon?”\n“Or are you just trying to get in my skirts?”\nBo flinched, and Nila saw immediately she’d said the wrong thing. It\nhad been true. Every word. And she’d just thrown it back in his face – even\nif it had been in jest.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I didn’t mean…”\nHe smiled crookedly at her. “Nah. That’s fair enough. I should go find\nmy tent.”\n“Don’t leave.”\nHe frowned at her, then squeezed her one more time.\nNila fell asleep with her head on his chest, listening to the rhythmic\nbeat of his heart. As she drifted off, the screams echoing in her memory\nseemed quieter.\nSomething told her there would be more in the future.\nCHAPTER 20\nT\namas sifted through mountains of reports on the battle that he had been\ngiven credit for winning.\nThe men had taken to calling it the Battle of Ned’s Creek, after the\nstream that ran down the middle of the battlefield. It seemed, based on\ncamp gossip that excluded any mention of Tamas’s four-day disappearance,\nthat Abrax had decided to keep quiet about his absence, despite her anger,\nand that Olem had managed to keep his Riflejacks silent. For now. Several\nhundred people knew he had gone to rescue Taniel. Word would get out.\nBut the more time that elapsed until it happened, the better.\nTamas had read Vlora’s report three times. He’d also read reports from\nthree generals, five colonels, two captains, and a sergeant. Vlora’s was by\nfar the most comprehensive, but the others had filled him in on details that\nVlora had either missed or chosen to omit.\nHe rubbed his eyes and let out a sigh. What he’d give for a bowl of\nMihali’s squash soup. Or even just a few minutes to chat with him. Mihali,\nfor all his faults, had a way of relaxing Tamas that he hadn’t even realized\nuntil he’d been told that the god was dead.\nPerhaps it was just sentiment.\n“Olem!” he shouted. “Olem!”"

Shadows\nplayed on his face from Tamas’s lantern. “Sorry, sir, it’s Olem’s off-hours.\nIs there anything I can do for you?”\n“Ah, no. Never mind. I can… Wait, what time is it?”\n“I think it’s around eleven o’clock, sir.”\n“Thank you. Find Inspector Adamat for me. If he’s still awake, have\nhim meet me here in half an hour. Otherwise, let him sleep.”\nTamas had read the inspector’s report as well. The man deserved his\nrest.\nHe climbed to his feet and stretched, only to wince as the pain shot\nthrough his gut. Pressing a palm against his wound, Tamas crossed to his\ndesk and rummaged around until he found a plate with the night’s dinner.\nThe biscuits were hard, the cheese moldy, and the beef stringy. He choked\ndown half of it before he gave up completely and gathered up a pair of gold\nbars from his desk, pocketed them, and stepped out into the night.\nSomewhere nearby, a soldier was playing her fiddle, singing softly\nwith the tune, her voice carrying over the otherwise quiet camp. Tamas’s\nguards snapped to attention. “At ease,” he said. “I’m going for a walk. You\ncan tag along, but give me some quiet.”\nThe guards followed at a respectful distance as he wandered through\nthe camp. He waved away soldiers who tried to stand and salute, and soon\nthe sound of the singing infantrywoman had faded, leaving the night to be\npunctuated by distant cries and moans that came from the north, where the\nsurgeons had set up hospitals. Fourteen hundred men had lost limbs since\nthe battle, and hundreds more had taken fatal wounds. For the latter, doctors\ncould only give them mala and wait for the inevitable.\nAfter the adrenaline had worn off and medals had been awarded and\nthe glory meted out, only the suffering remained after a battle.\n“I should have been here for them. Led them into battle,” Tamas\nmuttered.\n“Sir?” one of his guards asked.\n“Nothing. Have either of you any idea where Captain Vlora has\nbunked down?”\n“No sir,” they both answered.\nTamas found Olem’s tent not far from his own. Several of the\nRiflejacks still sat around the fire. One was reading by lamplight, while\nanother whittled at a piece of wood. They all stood when Tamas\napproached.\n“At ease,” he said with a sigh. He gestured to Olem’s tent. “Just here to\nsee the colonel.”\nTwo of the Riflejacks exchanged looks. A third, a woman of about\nthirty with blond hair cropped short, cleared her throat. “I think he’s\nasleep,” she said.\nTamas squinted at her. “He’s a Knacked. He doesn’t need sleep.”\nEveryone knew about Olem’s Knack. What was she going on about?\n“I… I think I saw him leave earlier,” one of the others said."

What was she going on about?\n“I… I think I saw him leave earlier,” one of the others said.\nTamas sprinkled a bit of powder on his tongue and headed over to\nOlem’s tent. “Olem, are you… ?” The vision in his powder trance allowed\nhim to see the inside as if it were day, despite the lack of lamps. Tamas\nthought he heard a giggle, and then a curse, and Olem sat up in his cot. He\nwas stripped to the waist.\n“Sir?”\nTamas eyed the lump in the cot next to him and couldn’t help but crack\na smile. Perhaps Olem had reconnected with the pretty laundress. “I’m\nsorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.”\n“No problem at all, sir.”\n“I was just looking for Vlora.”\nOlem cleared his throat. “Er…”\n“I’m right here.” Vlora sat up in the cot next to Olem and brushed her\nhair out of her face with one hand.\n“Ah,” Tamas said. “I, uh, will wait outside.”\nHe retreated to the campfire, where the Riflejacks studiously avoided\nhis gaze. Tamas tapped his foot, trying to think of something to say to Vlora\nother than “fraternization between ranks.”\n“Sorry, sir,” one of the Riflejacks mumbled. Another one kicked him\nin the shins.\n“It’s all right,” Tamas said. Part of him wanted to laugh. “I’d expect\nnothing less from one of them” – he thrust his thumb at his guards – “if I\nhad someone in the sack.” That brought out a muffled snort from the same\nRiflejack. He received another kick for it.\nVlora stepped out of Olem’s tent a moment later, pulling her jacket on\nover her half-buttoned shirt. Her boots were still unlaced, and she paused to\ndo them up while Tamas waited, then followed him away from the\ncampfire.\n“I’m not sorry, sir,” she said when they were out of earshot of Olem\nand the Riflejacks.\n“Hmm? Sorry for what?”\nVlora stiffened and Tamas turned to her with a sigh. “It’s life, Vlora.\nYou said that to me yourself. I’m glad you can still find something in each\nother’s arms. I wish I had that same luxury.”\n“Sir?” Vlora stared back at him openmouthed, and Tamas smothered a\nsmall smile. He could still surprise people. That was good to know. Vlora\ncontinued, “Do you mean… ?”\n“I’m not here to reprimand you or anything. I wanted to find you for\nsomething else. Fraternization between ranks is still an offense, mind you.\nBut I don’t have the energy for that right now.”\n“Thank you, sir.” Vlora regarded him with guarded eyes, as if waiting\nfor the other shoe to drop. “You’re giving mixed signals, sir.”\n“I know.

Wish I had thought of that. But I didn’t. I promoted him\nbecause the circumstance called for it and he’s one of the few people I can\ntrust completely.” He sighed, dismissing the subject with a wave of his\nhand, fighting the urge to say something else. He still didn’t approve of the\nrelationship, but he no longer felt it was his place to say. “Speaking of\nwhich, I’m promoting you.”\nVlora blinked at him. “I’m sorry?”\n“I said I’m promoting you. To colonel, actually. For now, you’ll be on\nspecial assignment, just like Olem, but I intend on putting you in charge of\nyour own regiment before the end of the war.”\n“I don’t understand. I haven’t done anything to deserve that.”\n“You haven’t? Captain – I mean, Colonel – I have spent the last two\ndays poring over reports of the battle and of your actions. They were, in a\nword, brilliant.”\n“I was only working with your instructions,” Vlora mumbled.\n“No battle plan is perfect. Not even mine. Over a dozen critical\nsituations required your response, without my guidance, and you handled\neach one exactly as I would have. In the case of sending the two companies\nto relieve the Wings’ camp, you did it even better. I would have let them\nburn, then cleaned up the mess after the chaos died down, which would\nhave been the wrong thing to do.”\nTamas hadn’t meant to go on, but he found the words tumbling out of\nhim. “These are, of course, extraordinary circumstances. We lost a lot of\nofficers over the last couple of months, and not all of them to death or\nwounds.” Hilanska’s betrayal and Ket’s thievery and flight still rankled.\n“There will be hundreds of promotions in the next week, and you won’t be\nthe only one to skip ranks. I’d always meant to keep my powder mages as\nmarksmen and soldiers, but I see now that I need to promote those with the\ntalent.”\n“Andriya should be promoted too.”\n“He will be, as soon as he arrives with the Deliv king. But Andriya is\ntoo hotheaded. Too vengeful. He’s always been better with small groups,\nwhich is why he’s been in command of the cabal since Sabon. But you’ve\nalways had a talent for seeing the bigger picture and you proved it the other\nday.”\n“Thank you, sir.”\nTamas nodded. “This war isn’t won yet, Colonel. Don’t thank me until\nit is.”\nThey stood in silence for several minutes, and it was Vlora who spoke\nfirst.\n“Sir?”\n“Yes?”\n“May I go?”\n“Oh. Oh, yes! Go on. Wait, take these.” Tamas put the gold bars into\nher hand, then folded her fingers over them. He had the sudden urge to bend\nand kiss her on the forehead gently, a blessing for a daughter, but he stifled\nit just long enough for her to lunge forward and hug him. Tamas found\nhimself returning the embrace. Then she was off, and Tamas watched her\nfor a moment."

Then she was off, and Tamas watched her\nfor a moment.\n“Uh, sir,” a voice said.\nTamas turned to find a secretary waiting nearby. “What is it?”\n“Inspector Adamat is waiting for you.”\n“Ah. Yes. Of course. I’ll come right away.” He tossed one more glance\nin Vlora’s direction, but she was already gone.\nAdamat shifted from one foot to the other and stifled a yawn. It was almost\nmidnight, and there was still no sign of the field marshal. Should he go?\nShould he wait?\nNo doubt that Tamas wanted to question him about the series of events\nthat culminated in Vetas’s death. It had all been in his report, of course, but\na report was never as good as the real thing. Tamas was the kind of man\nwho liked to be thorough. Adamat just hoped he wasn’t going to be too\nthorough.\nAny questions about Josep, Adamat had already decided, would be\nevaded as well as possible.\nAdamat ran his hand through his hair and scratched at his bald spot.\nHe’d spent countless hours examining that Warden in his mind and he had\ncome to the conclusion that a perfect memory was most certainly a curse.\nWithout it, he may have convinced himself that it was just a trick of the\nlight: That Warden was nothing like his son, and the missing ring finger was\nsimply a coincidence.\nBut the more Adamat considered the deformed back and twisted but\nstill boyish jaw and the smooth cheeks, he was convinced that his boy had\nbeen turned into a Warden.\nWhat had they done to his innocent boy? First a captive, then a powder\nmage sold into slavery, and now this. Adamat tried to remember everything\nhe knew about Wardens. They were regular men transformed by Kez\nsorcery into twisted creatures devoid of anything but rudimentary\nintelligence and brainwashed to obey Kez commanders. These new Black\nWardens, created out of powder mages, were only a recent development.\nSome of the soldiers whispered that they had been created by Kresimir\nhimself, as none of the other Privileged would be powerful enough to twist\na powder mage.\nWhat suffering had that caused? What pain had the villainous god\nforced upon Adamat’s son? Adamat replayed the scene in his head over and\nover again, and examined the eyes of the creature. He expected, upon a\ncloser look, to find anger and sorcery-fueled rage in those eyes.\nBut there was only fear, of the kind seen in a dumb ox being driven to\nslaughter.\n“Inspector?”\nAdamat heard the rustle of the tent flap, wiped hastily at his eyes, and\nstraightened his coat. “Sir, I’m here.”\n“Inspector, what are you doing standing here in the dark?” Tamas\nasked. Adamat could hear the field marshal rummaging about on his desk,\nthen a match was struck and a lantern lit.\n“Just waiting. I didn’t want to bother anyone.”\n“We can provide a light, man. I’m sorry to be so rude. I hope I didn’t\nwake you.”\nTamas peered closely at Adamat’s face and Adamat flinched away.\n“You did not.”"

Did they get\nyou a proper tent and gear?”\n“They did. Thank you.”\n“I’m sorry to keep you in the camp like this. You understand I’ve had a\nlot to catch up with.”\n“Of course. I do look forward to getting back to my family.” Do I?\nHow will I explain what I have seen – what Josep has become – to Faye?\nAdamat realized with a start that he had already considered his son as good\nas dead. But then, what else could he consider? He’d stared into those eyes\nin his memory for so long, he knew that the Josep he loved was no more.\n“Are you certain everything is all right, Inspector?”\n“It is.”\nTamas lowered himself into a seat, looking far worse for the wear, and\nAdamat pulled his mind off his own troubles to examine the field marshal.\nTroubled by a dozen wounds, or so it seemed, Tamas had aged ten years in\nthe last three months. What little trace of black might have remained in his\nmustache was gone, and he moved carefully, painfully, favoring his right\nside.\nAdamat had seen that kind of behavior before in men in the Adran\npolice force. Tamas had a knife wound – between the ribs, lucky enough to\nmiss anything vital, but painful as all pit and likely to fester. There were\nrumors that Hilanska had stabbed Tamas before he fled. They certainly fit.\n“Inspector?”\nAdamat snapped out of his own thoughts. Tamas had been talking.\n“I’m very sorry, sir. Could you repeat that?”\nTamas tilted his head to one side, a twitch of anger crossing his face. “I\nasked if you know why I didn’t arrest you after you confessed your\ntreachery.”\n“I don’t.” Adamat felt a bead of cold sweat on his forehead and his\njacket was suddenly too tight. It was something he’d asked himself, though\nhe hadn’t dwelt on it. There was too much to do, too much at stake.\n“I didn’t arrest you because that’s what the enemy would have\nexpected.” Tamas climbed to his feet and crossed to his desk, pouring water\ninto a glass. He didn’t offer any to Adamat. “It was a feint, to throw him off\nyour trail. You mentioned in your report that Vetas thought you had been\nimprisoned.”\n“So I did,” Adamat said, his throat dry. “It worked.”\nTamas took a sip of water, watching Adamat with a look that Adamat\nhad seen on men deciding whether to put down a lame dog. “Yes.”\n“And now?”\n“I still hold you responsible for Sabon’s death, Inspector,” Tamas said.\n“I had told myself that you would stand trial when all this was over. That\nyou would face the consequences of your actions.”\nAdamat suddenly felt a fire in his belly. The consequences? He, who\nbrought me into this whole mess, has the gall to speak to me about\nconsequences? I’ve faced the consequences of my actions a hundred times"

I’ve faced the consequences of my actions a hundred times\nover during the last six months. Adamat had to bite his tongue to hold his\npeace.\n“I had told myself that – right up until the moment I had to choose\nbetween leading my men into battle and rescuing my son from being\nmurdered in the wilderness by traitors. You’re a good man, Adamat, and\nyou did what you could. There are so few good men left, and I will not send\none to the guillotine. But I need your help.”\nAdamat barely trusted himself to breathe. “My help?”\n“There is more work to be done.”\nAdamat felt his chest tighten. Of course. Always more to do. What\nwould Faye say to this, were she here with him? She would tell the field\nmarshal to stuff his consequences in his ass and to toss himself into the pit.\n“Something funny, Inspector?”\n“I was just thinking of what my wife would say if she were here.”\n“Oh? And what was that?”\n“She’d ask, ‘What can I do to help, Field Marshal?’ So. What can I do\nto help?” There was nothing else to say. Tamas would expect nothing short\nof obedience. It was the same arrogance that Adamat had seen for decades\namong the nobility whom he’d served.\nTamas seemed thrown for a moment. “I see. I still have to finish this\nwar, and when it is done, I’ll need to deal with the Brudanian army that\nholds Adopest. Some kind of contact needs to be made. You shall be my\nliaison with Lord Claremonte. Find out what he wants. What are his goals?\nWhat will make him go away and, if that is not within our reach, discover\nhis secrets and weaknesses and report them to me so I may destroy him and\ngive our country the republic it deserves.”\nAdamat felt something niggling deep inside his bowels. It felt an awful\nlot like despair. He’d dealt with the servant Lord Vetas, and now he had to\ndeal with the master, who could only be many times the worse? It would\nundo him. “I will not put my family in that danger again, Field Marshal.\nNot for my life.”\n“Your country needs you.”\nAdamat wondered if Tamas knew how hollow the words sounded.\n“You cannot entrust me with this. Not possibly. Lord Claremonte, through\nhis agent, used my family against me once and he will do it again. And if he\ndoes that, I will betray you again, I promise you that.”\n“Your family is no longer in the equation. There is nothing Claremonte\nwould gain by threatening them. You will be a politician and nothing\nmore.”\n“He can compel me to give you misinformation.”\n“You have my guarantee of their safety.”\nAdamat found himself standing once more. “You cannot make that\nguarantee! This man is a beast and will use any means necessary to win his\ntwisted game. I have seen his machinations!”\n“And that, Inspector, is why I need you so badly. You are the only one\nwho knows anything about him. You are the only one who hates him"

You will hear no such guarantees from\nClaremonte while he holds the city.” Tamas took another sip of his water.\n“I’m sorry, Field Marshal, but I must refuse.”\n“You said —”\n“I asked what I could do to help. I did not offer to put myself and my\nfamily back into harm’s way. No, sir, I will not deal with Claremonte. I\nhave already put my family through enough as it is for this cause. I have\nlost a son!” And to something far worse than death.\nTamas frowned down into his cup. “I see.”\nAdamat realized that his heart was pounding. He’d not expected to\ncome in here and start shouting, but he had to draw the line somewhere.\nThe lives of Tamas’s men were in his own hands, and damn him if he\nthought he could use guilt as leverage against Adamat.\n“You’ll be going back to Adopest soon?” Tamas asked.\n“First thing in the morning,” Adamat said. He lowered himself back\ninto his chair. He felt so incredibly old.\n“Would a lesser request sway you?”\nAdamat cocked an eyebrow, sensing a trap. Tamas had backed off of\nthat far too quickly for one of his kind. “What is it?” He cleared his throat\nand lowered his voice. “What can I do, sir?”\n“Offer Ricard your help in his political campaign. He’ll need all the\naid he can get – especially from men he trusts. You two are friends, are you\nnot?”\n“Ricard is running against Claremonte,” Adamat said. The very man\nAdamat wished to avoid.\nTamas made a calming gesture. “I’m not asking you to get too closely\ninvolved. Just give him some help. A kind word. Lend him your talent for\nmemory. Whatever you can spare.”\n“I’ll do what I can,” Adamat said after a moment’s consideration. “But\nI don’t guarantee anything. I will not get caught up in Claremonte’s web\nagain.”\nTamas responded with a tight nod. He opened his mouth to say\nsomething else, but they were interrupted by a light rap on the tent pole and\na messenger putting his head inside. “Sir?”\n“What is it?”\n“I’ve a messenger from the king.”\n“What king? Deliv? They’re here already?”\n“No, sir. From the Kez. Ipille has sued for peace. He wants to parley.”\nAdamat’s presence was forgotten the moment word came that the Kez\nwanted to discuss terms of peace. He slunk back to his tent amongst the\nensuing round of late-night messengers and sudden meetings and managed\njust a few hours of restless sleep before his carriage was ready to take him\nback to Adopest.\nHe bid his driver to wait for him, and stole through the morning chaos\nof the camp, working off directions from the field marshal’s bodyguard to\nfind one particular tent in a sea of thousands.\nHe was saved the embarrassment of having to put his head in tent after"

His jacket\nwas immaculately pressed, his muttonchops trimmed. He looked as dapper\nas an officer with half a dozen batboys. Adamat wondered how sorcery\ncould be applied to help one’s morning routine, and at the same time noted\nthat the fire had no fuel.\n“Good morning, Inspector,” Bo said softly. He put a finger to his lips\nand pointed to the tent behind him.\n“Good morning, Privileged.” Adamat took his hat in his hands and\ntried not to look nervous.\nThe Privileged glanced up from his sorcerous fire. “Is there something\nI can help you with?”\n“I…” Adamat cleared his throat. Maybe this wasn’t a good idea.\nMaybe it would be for the best if he just left things alone.\n“Yes?”\n“It’s a sensitive matter.”\nBo took out the pipe from between his lips and scowled at the empty\nbowl. “Haven’t had a spare minute to find any pipe tobacco. You wouldn’t\nhappen to have any, would you?”\nAdamat felt around for his own pipe and pouch, and removed it from\nhis pocket. “Just a little.” He gave the rest of the pouch to Bo, who nodded\nhis thanks, taking a moment to pack his pipe and light the bowl from a\nflame that sprang from his finger. He looked up, meeting Adamat’s eyes.\nWhatever the Privileged had been pondering when Adamat\napproached had been tucked away. He now had Bo’s full attention, and he\nwasn’t sure he wanted it.\n“Does this have to do with your son?” Bo asked.\n“It does.”\n“I promised I would help you get him back. Tamas is trying to recruit\nme, and that complicates things. But I still plan on holding to my promise.”\n“I’m returning to Adopest,” Adamat said.\nBo watched him carefully, his eyes soft. “Have you given up?” His\nvoice was not unkind.\n“Circumstances have changed.”\n“In what way?”\nAdamat licked his lips. It was time to be strong. For himself. For Faye.\nFor Josep. “My son has been turned into a Warden. A Black Warden. I saw\nhim myself at the battle. He would have killed me, but I called his name and\nhe fled.”\n“Can you be sure?”\n“As sure as I can.”\nBo seemed to consider this for a moment. “I can’t do anything for him.\nThe process of creating a Warden cannot be reversed. The Adran Cabal has\ntried. And these Black Wardens, even their corpses stink of Kresimir’s\nsorcery. I would likely die trying to counter that.”\n“I know. I mean, I read a book on Wardens once. Only a few chapters,\nreally, but I know that the process can’t be reversed.”\n“Then why are you here?”\n“I wanted to change the terms of our agreement.” Adamat thought that\nBo might disagree immediately. After all, an agreement was an agreement."

After all, an agreement was an agreement.\nHe expected Bo to hold to nothing but the letter of it.\n“I’m listening,” Bo said.\n“I want you to find my son. And I want you to kill him.”\nCHAPTER 21\nI\nt took four days to arrange the parley. During the uneasy peace, brigades\non both sides were reinforced and allowed to posture, and messengers were\nexchanged. Two days after finalizing the parley, Tamas found himself in a\ntown just off the southern highway about fifteen miles north of Fendale.\nCalling it a town was actually quite generous. There were less than a\ndozen buildings, the biggest of which, a Kresim chapel, had been\nappropriated for the purpose of the meeting. There was no sign of the\nprevious occupants of the town. Whether they’d evacuated months ago or\nbeen enslaved by the Kez, there was no way of knowing, and it wasn’t high\non Tamas’s list of questions to ask the Kez king.\nRiders came and went for the better part of the morning, and Tamas\npassed his time watching Ipille’s retinue where they camped on the other\nside of the town, about a mile away. Not a lot of the camp was visible –\nIpille had set up in a shallow ravine, out of the wind.\nAnd out of sight of any powder mages.\nTamas commented on the fact to Olem, who lifted his looking glass to\nexamine one of Ipille’s royal guard standing on a hill overlooking the Kez\ncamp.\n“He doesn’t trust you, sir,” Olem said.\n“I can’t terribly blame him. I did try to kill him once.”\nOlem lowered his looking glass and removed a cigarette from the\ncorner of his mouth. “He’s tried to have you killed a dozen times, at least.”\n“True,” Tamas said wistfully. “But I’ve wrapped my fingers around his\nthroat. That’s a little different.”\n“Ah. You ever going to tell me that story?”\n“Maybe when I’m drunk someday.”\n“You don’t drink, sir.”\n“Exactly.”\nOne of Olem’s Riflejacks rode up to give his report, and a moment\nlater Olem conferred with Tamas. “Sir, my boys have given the all-clear.\nThe town is empty except for a couple of Ipille’s royal guard, and they’ve\nscouted everything within half a dozen miles. If it’s a trap, Ipille is far\ncleverer than we give him credit.”\n“Ipille is far cleverer than we give him credit. Fortunately for us, the\none skill he lacks is the ability to select for talent. That’s why all of his\ngenerals and field marshals have only ever been half-competent at best.\nYou’ve had a few Knacked checking for Privileged and Wardens?”\n“No Wardens. And just one fifth-rate Privileged. Supposedly she’s the\nhead of the royal cabal now, with everyone stronger dead.”\n“Tell Vlora to keep the Privileged in her sights, in case she tries\nsomething.”\n“You know, sir,” Olem mused, “Ipille is doubtless traveling with a\nkingly entourage.

We could…” He imitated a pistol with his thumb and forefinger.\n“Don’t tempt me.” The thought had already occurred to Tamas.\nSeveral times. “We’re in position to end this war. Kill Ipille, and one of his\nbloody stupid sons will call for our heads and might even gain sympathy\nthroughout the Nine. Taniel!” Tamas waved his son forward. Taniel looked\nup from speaking with one of the Riflejacks and waved back. He said a few\nmore words and walked over.\nTaniel had cleaned up well since his ordeal in the mountains. He’d\nshaved, bathed, and been given a new uniform. He bore a dozen more scars\nthan when Tamas had sent him up South Pike Mountain, and there was a\npatch of white hair around his right ear that Tamas hadn’t noticed before.\nHe wore the powder keg pin of a powder mage on his breast, but no rank.\nTamas drummed his fingers on his saddle horn. “I gave you a\npromotion, you know,” he said, eyeing Taniel’s empty lapels.\n“Technically,” Taniel responded, “I’m not one of your soldiers\nanymore.”\n“That’s rubbish and you know it.”\nTaniel let his weight fall to his back leg and his hand rested on the butt\nof one pistol. Even here, surrounded by allies, he adopted the stance of a\ncasual killer. Similar to Olem, but without the bodyguard’s watchfulness.\nTaniel wasn’t ready to kill because he needed to. Just… because.\n“I made an agreement with Brigadier Abrax. I’m a member of the\nWings of Adom.”\n“And I told you that you never left my service. Your dismissal was\norchestrated by a traitor on one side and a war profiteer on the other. No\ncourt, military or civilian, would uphold the results of that court-martial.”\n“Of course, father,” Taniel said quietly.\nTamas bristled. They’d had this conversation a dozen times, and each\ntime Taniel made a show of conceding the point. But he still had yet to\nattach the major’s pins to his lapel.\n“This could be a trap,” Taniel said.\nTamas shook his head. “We’ve checked.”\n“It’s the real thing? Ipille wants peace?”\n“That’s what we’ve been led to believe.”\n“We could just kill him,” Taniel said.\nOlem nodded emphatically. “That was my suggestion.”\nTamas sighed. No need to dignify that with a response. As much as he\nwanted Ipille’s head on the end of a bayonet, he was acting as a politician\nnow. This had to be done right. And, he reminded himself at the sight of a\ngroup of riders cresting the highway a few hundred yards distant, he wasn’t\ndoing this himself.\n“My lady,” Tamas greeted Lady Winceslav when she arrived.\nThe Lady wore a sharp red riding dress with black boots and rode with\na carbine laid across her saddle. She pulled up next to Tamas and looked\nhim up and down.\n“Abrax is furious with you.”\n“I know.”\n“So am I.”"

And you almost lost us this war.” Her tone was level,\none eyebrow raised as if she were slightly bemused. Despite her outward\nappearance, Tamas had known the Lady long enough to see that she was\nquite put out.\n“But I didn’t,” he said.\n“You’re incorrigible. Hello, Olem. Hello, Taniel.”\nOlem nodded. Taniel stepped to the Lady’s side and kissed her hand.\n“Good afternoon, my lady.”\n“I’m glad to see you’re still alive. No thanks to this one.” She jerked\nher chin at Tamas, and Tamas forced himself to swallow a biting remark.\n“Are you sure,” she continued, “that you want to remain in the employ of\nthe Adran army? I’ll double whatever they’re paying you.”\nTamas eyed his son for a moment, and Taniel seemed to enjoy the\nuncomfortable silence that followed. Finally, he said, “My place is here, my\nlady. For now.”\n“Pity.”\n“A word, my lady?” Tamas asked.\nThey both led their horses off to the side and Tamas leaned over to her.\n“Will the Wings of Adom continue their support of this battle?”\n“I’m having serious doubts as to the mental fortitude of the Adran field\nmarshal,” Lady Winceslav said, looking him up and down.\n“Oh? And you’ve made better decisions in the recent past? Shall I\nbring up a certain scandal among your brigadiers that’s only a few months\nold?”\nLady Winceslav pursed her lips. “Tell me, can you count the number\nof younger women you’ve slept with on one hand? On two? How about we\ninclude toes?”\n“This bickering is unbecoming,” Tamas said, giving her a tight smile.\n“Is that the best you’ve got? Where’s that famous grin you used to bag\nthem all with?” Lady Winceslav shook her head before he could answer.\n“I’m here in my capacity as a member of your council. Not as the head of\nthe Wings of Adom. We took impossible losses last week and we haven’t\nyet decided what to do about it.” Tamas opened his mouth, but Lady\nWinceslav leaned close and whispered, “We’re going to withdraw. But I\nwon’t make that announcement for a couple of days. As far as this parley is\nconcerned, we will provide a unified front.”\nTamas’s throat was dry. “Thank you,” he said back quietly. Louder,\n“Well. I’ll look forward to hearing your answer.” He was not happy to hear\nher decision. If Ipille continued the war, he would need her mercenaries\nmore than ever. But he couldn’t make an issue of it now.\nTamas noted that someone else had ridden in just behind Lady\nWinceslav’s escort. He frowned and wheeled his mount toward the\napproaching rider.\n“Nila, was it?”\nThe laundress-turned-Privileged nodded her head. She kept a white-\nknuckle grip on the saddle horn, and scowled at the roan stepping nervously\nbeneath her.\n“Been riding long?”"

Well, you can go back to Bo and tell him that this is not\nappropriate.”\nThe smile wavered, but to the girl’s credit she did not flinch. “I won’t\ndo that, sir.”\n“Even if I order it?”\n“With all due respect, I am not under your command, sir.”\nHe could see the nervousness in her eyes now. The slight shake of her\nhands on the reins. What was this, some kind of test that Bo had put her to?\nFace down Field Marshal Tamas?\n“It is within my power to bar you from the negotiations.”\n“You can’t, sir. I have every right to be here as the representative of the\nAdran Republic Cabal.”\n“The what? Taniel!” Tamas whirled his horse and beckoned\nimpatiently for his son. Taniel arrived a moment later. “What the pit is your\nfriend playing at?”\n“What friend?”\n“Don’t act coy with me. Borbador. What is this business about the\nAdran Republic Cabal?”\nTaniel looked at Nila, then at Tamas, suppressing a chuckle. “He’s not\nplaying at anything, sir. You’ve asked him to help with the war effort and\nhe’s the last trained Privileged left in Adro. Nila is his apprentice and, from\nwhat Bo tells me, she is even stronger than he is. Those two are the Adran\nCabal now, and since we’re trying to be a republic, he thought it pointless to\ncontinue calling it the royal cabal.”\nTamas opened his mouth once, then closed it, trying to think of an\nargument against this that didn’t end with him saying “because I say so.”\nHe couldn’t come up with one. Bo was, technically, still a government\nPrivileged.\n“Don’t say a bloody word,” Tamas said, pointing at Nila. “I’m grateful\nfor what you did at the battle last week and it’s earned you my goodwill.\nBut I will not have a former laundress arguing points of politics with the\nbloody king of Kez.”\nNila’s ingratiating smile returned. “Of course, Field Marshal. I’m only\nhere as a representative.”\nTamas spurred his horse back to Olem. “The laundress is going with\nus.”\n“Yes sir. It’s almost the appointed time.”\nTamas gave a silent prayer of thanks that Olem had accepted the news"

It’s almost the appointed time.”\nTamas gave a silent prayer of thanks that Olem had accepted the news\nwithout comment. “Send a man ahead. Vlora, you have command until I\nreturn. If anything happens, kill Ipille’s Privileged first, and then Ipille.”\n“Yes sir.”\nTamas led his delegation across the lonely field to the outskirts of the\ntown, where they waited for their messenger to return and tell them that\nIpille was already in the chapel. They dismounted and left their horses tied\nbeside one of the small houses, then walked the last hundred yards of the\njourney.\nTwo of the Kez royal guard flanked the chapel. Tamas looked them up\nand down – they wore gold on black, with gray trim. Their feathered, flat-\ntop hats were tipped forward, chin straps hugging their jaws. Dark,\nunflinching eyes gazed back at Tamas, and he wished he had his powder\ncabal with him. The Kez royal guard was not to be trifled with. He doubted\neven Olem’s Riflejacks measured up to them.\n“I’m here to see your king,” Tamas said.\nOne of them snapped a nod and turned sharply on his heel to open the\nchapel door. Olem left two men, one for each of the Kez, and then went\nfirst, followed by Lady Winceslav and Nila. Three of Tamas’s generals, two\ncolonels, and a lawyer who had come along with Lady Winceslav filed\ninside.\nTaniel hung back, a sour look on his face as if he’d swallowed a lime\nwhole.\nTamas waited patiently for Taniel to finally come forward. “It’s time to\nend this,” Tamas said.\nA muscle jumped in Taniel’s jaw. For a moment, Tamas thought his\nson’s discipline would fail him, but ever the soldier, Taniel gave a sharp nod\nand headed in, leaving Tamas to steel his own emotions before he followed\nto complete the delegation.\nThe chapel was poorly lit by a single window on the eastern side. It\nwas one large room, only about twenty feet by thirty. The pews had been\nstacked along the walls and a large table brought in, covered with a gold\ncloth and a small feast of fruits and desserts. Candelabras had been lit and\nartwork hung along the walls – no doubt, additions made by Ipille’s retinue\nto give some semblance of royalty to the place.\nA small group of politicians occupied the far end of the table. Field\nMarshal Goutlit sat on one side with a pair of generals Tamas did not\nrecognize. On the other was a thin woman with delicate, birdlike features in\nthe official tan-and-green robe of the Kez royal cabal. Beside her sat a pale,\nlimp-looking fellow named Duke Regalish – Ipille’s closest adviser. A few\nother noblemen stood along the back wall.\nIpille himself sat at the head of the table.\nHe’d grown morbidly obese since the last time they had met, the night\nTamas had tried to kill him.

He wore\nswaths of cloth; thick, bristling furs draped over his shoulders, trimmed\nwith gold, and on his fingers rubies that would make an Arch-Diocel blush.\n“Tamas.” Ipille’s voice sounded like the inside of a bass drum, and his\njowls shook when he spoke.\n“Ipille.”\nA chair scraped the stone floor, and Duke Regalish shot to his feet.\n“You will address his august majesty as ‘Your Royal Highness.’ He is a\nking, you common cur, and you will treat him as such.”\n“Shall I put this dog down?” Olem asked, his hand resting on the hilt\nof his smallsword.\nTamas let his silence speak for him, letting Regalish stand quivering\nwith indignation until Ipille turned his head toward his adviser. “Sit down,\nmy good duke. Your whimpering will have no effect on Tamas. He is a man\nof iron. Iron does not bend. It only shatters.”\nTamas clasped his hands behind his back and tried to focus through the\npain in his side.\nIpille’s fat fingers drummed heavily on the oak table as Olem made his\nway silently around the room. He bent to lift the tablecloth, then strolled\naround the table, looking over each of the advisers with a studious eye,\nignoring their baleful glares.\n“What is this, Tamas?”\n“Precaution.”\n“We’re here under a flag of truce, are we not?”\n“Come now, Your Moribund Majesty. You took your precaution by\narriving first. I take mine now.”\nIpille’s deep chuckle forestalled another outburst from Regalish.\nOlem finished his search and gave Tamas a nod, and Tamas gestured to\nthe chairs on his end of the table. “Ipille, I will introduce Lady Winceslav –\nI believe you’ve met. My son, Major Taniel Two-shot. Privileged Nila of\nthe Adran Republic Cabal. Members of my senior staff.”\n“Charmed,” the king said. “You know Regalish. I believe you killed\nhis uncle. Some of my advisers back there,” he said with a dismissive wave.\n“Field Marshal Goutlit. Magus Janna.” Another of Ipille’s deep chuckles.\n“We’re both scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Privileged,\nare we not? Sad times.”\nTamas gestured for his companions to sit, then took his own place at\nthe opposite end of the table from Ipille. “I’d wager on my own companion\nin a fight.”\n“Would you? My spies tell me she’s an untrained apprentice.”\nHis spies? The royal arrogance showing through. I know he has spies\nin my army, of course. But for him to admit so is… obscene. “Did they tell\nyou that she cooked the whole of one of your brigades?” Out of the corner\nof his eye Tamas saw Nila sit up a little straighter, trying to look regal. She\nwas a striking young woman – though the redness on her cheeks marred the\nimage a bit. A little skill and confidence, and she would dominate this kind"

Bo hadn’t sent her as a rebellious insult, Tamas realized,\nhe’d sent her to learn.\n“And fainted afterward!” Ipille made a dismissive gesture.\n“Auxiliaries. I can always get more men. I imagine you’re running out. Isn’t\nthat right, Lady Winceslav?”\nLady Winceslav gave the king a tight smile and flicked open a fan,\nfanning herself gently. “War is equally unkind to all, Your Majesty.”\n“But especially to those with the fewest troops. Now Tamas, are we\ngoing to sit here making veiled insults and threats, or shall we treat\ntogether?”\n“You have an offer?”\nIpille nodded to Regalish, and the adviser stood, clearing his throat.\n“This war is costing both our countries millions. By the grace of our lord\nKresimir and Ipille II, king of Kez, we extend terms of peace.” He paused\nto clear his throat again. “We will withdraw our forces to Budwiel and the\ncity will be ceded voluntarily to Kez control. Kez will acknowledge the\nautonomy of the Adran nation, and in exchange will be paid the sum of one\nhundred million krana as reparations.”\nRegalish continued for another five minutes on the particulars of their\noffer, consulting an official-looking document twice on some minor detail.\nWhen he’d finished, he cleared his throat once more and returned to his\nseat.\nTamas put one elbow on the table, resting his chin on his palm, and\nraised one eyebrow at Ipille.\n“You’re very amusing people,” Lady Winceslav commented.\n“You have no chance of winning, Tamas,” Ipille rumbled. “I can afford\nthe losses of the past six months. They are a drop in the bucket to our\npopulation. You cannot. If nothing else, we will win by attrition.”\n“Your men have told you that you’re now at war with Deliv, correct?\nThe late Duke Nikslaus made a grave error by attacking Alvation with the\nintention of blaming Adro, and I understand they’ve invaded you from the\nnorth while also sending some sixty thousand reinforcements, which will\narrive in just a few days. And they still have an entire royal cabal.”\nIpille’s expression gave nothing away. Regalish leaned close to him to\nwhisper in his ear.\n“Where is your one-eyed god, king?” Taniel said suddenly, his voice\ncutting through Regalish’s whispers. “Where are your mighty Privileged\nand your great armies? Where are your spies and your traitors bought with\ngold and religion?”\nIpille brushed Regalish aside. “You wish to match yourself against me,\nboy? You fancy yourself a god-killer? Tell me, did you piss yourself when\nyou looked Kresimir in the face?”\n“No. I shot him in the eye.”\n“Kresimir lives yet.”\n“Resting peacefully, I’m sure,” Taniel sneered.\nTamas flinched. Watch yourself, Taniel, he thought. He only goads you\non so you will tell him our secrets. “That’s enough, Major,” Tamas said,"

He only goads you\non so you will tell him our secrets. “That’s enough, Major,” Tamas said,\nhating the smug smile in the corner of Ipille’s mouth. He removed a paper\nfrom his pocket and unfolded it.\n“We’re prepared to offer generous terms of our own. You will\nwithdraw from Adro completely, relinquishing all your false claims and\nrecognizing our republic with the Nine as witness. You will grant us ten\nthousand acres of the Amber Expanse. You will agree to a hundred years of\npeace, again witnessed by every country in the Nine, and you will return\nevery prisoner of war and grant us hostages to guarantee your agreement.”\n“And in return?”\n“I won’t slaughter your army like a herd of mad cattle.”\nRegalish was on his feet again. “You go too far!”\n“Sit down, you snake. I treat with your king, not his dogs. In addition\nto all this, you will hand over Kresimir.”\n“Kresimir is off the table,” Ipille said.\n“More like under it,” Taniel murmured.\nTamas gestured his son to silence. “Those are our terms.”\n“Such generosity,” Ipille grunted. “Shall I give you my firstborn as\nwell?”\n“I already have Beon, though I suppose he’s only the thirdborn.”\nThe Kez Privileged swallowed a laugh and received a glare from\nIpille. “Shall I cut off my leg for you, Tamas?” Ipille continued. “Grant you\na dukedom? You ask too much.”\n“Those are our terms,” Tamas said.\n“And they are intractable?”\n“Well. This is a negotiation.”\nThe Kez delegation huddled on their side of the room and Tamas took\nhis own advisers close to the chapel doors for privacy.\n“You’re a terrible negotiator,” Lady Winceslav said quietly. “ ‘This is a\nnegotiation?’ ” she mimicked. “You might as well tell him you’ll give up\nground.”\n“I’ve lost patience in my old age.”\n“We did not agree on the bit about Kresimir.”\n“Taniel already let slip that we know Kresimir is comatose,” Tamas\nsaid with a scathing glance at his son. “And besides, we can take whatever\nguarantees we want from the Kez. If Kresimir manages to come around, he\nwill destroy us regardless of Kez promises.”\n“Then what good will having him in our possession do?”\n“Our deaths will be that much quicker,” Olem suggested.\nTamas glared at his bodyguard. “We can discover how to contain him.\nOr kill him.”\n“He won’t budge on Kresimir,” Nila said. The young woman’s voice\nsurprised Tamas.\n“Are you skilled in statecraft, young Privileged?” Tamas asked, his\nirritation leaking through. His side had started to throb, and the conviction\nwith which he’d started the day was waning. Politics was supposed to be an\nold man’s game, yet it wearied Tamas more than war. He preferred the\nenergy and decisiveness of battle to the machinations of bloated monarchs\nand their council.\n“I agree with her,” Taniel said.\nOf course. “Right. On their demands?”"

On their demands?”\n“We won’t pay them a cent,” Lady Winceslav said.\n“And it’s unacceptable that we give them any of our land.” Nila again.\n“Of course, of course.”\nThe haggling went on through the afternoon. The Kez made offers, and\nTamas countered with his own, only to be rejected. The back-and-forth\ncontinued for hours, and they retired for lunch and then dinner provided by\nretainers from their respective camps.\nIt was two hours after nightfall when they agreed to conclude for the\nday and meet again in three days’ time.\n“I must consult with my advisers at greater length,” Ipille said. “And\ndiscuss the best interests of my people.”\n“Because you care so highly for their lives and well-being?” Tamas\nasked.\nIpille gave Tamas a shallow smile. “The crown is a heavy burden to\nwear.”\nA little later, Tamas mounted his horse and prepared to ride.\n“Shall we make camp nearby tonight?” Olem asked.\nTamas shook his head. “I’d rather be back with the army.”\n“That’s eight miles from here.”\nTamas looked first to Winceslav, then to Taniel, and then to Nila.\n“Your preferences?”\n“I’ll ride ahead if you camp,” Taniel said.\n“And I prefer not to be caught out with the Kez royal guard on the\nprowl,” said Lady Winceslav.\nIt was long past midnight when they neared the Adran camp, and\nTamas sagged in his saddle. His side hurt and his head felt like a millstone.\nThese negotiations would be drawn out and exhausting. Their only\nadvantage lay in the fact that Ipille would want to finish them before the\nDeliv army arrived to tip the scales. Deliv would demand to participate in\nthe negotiations from there on out and it would go worse for the Kez.\nTamas was surprised at how high Taniel rode in his saddle. Eager to\nget back to his lover, no doubt, and maybe farther from the man who was\nultimately responsible for his mother’s death. Tamas himself had\nsuppressed thoughts of Erika all day lest he reach across the table and finish\nthe job he’d started with his fingers around Ipille’s throat so many years\nago. It had been tiring.\n“Sir,” Olem said, breaking in to Tamas’s thoughts. “Something’s\nwrong.”\nTamas shook his head to rattle away the sleep. “What is it?”\nOlem pointed toward the north. The campfires burned on the horizon\nand the sky, lit by the cloudless moonlight, hung heavy with smoke.\nToo much flame and smoke to be cook fires. And there, on the wind –\nscreams?\n“Taniel, wait!” Tamas shouted. But Taniel was already well ahead of\nthem, off at a gallop.\nCHAPTER 22\nT\naniel entered the Adran camp at a full gallop, hurtling past soldiers and\ncamp followers.\nThe night was full of panicked shouts, punctuated by the screams of\nthe wounded, and the chill air choked with smoke.

The flames he had seen\nfrom a distance turned out to be fires jumping from tent to tent, burning the\ntrampled grasses and catching everything they could along the way. He\npassed several bucket brigades working from the nearest streams and soon\nfound himself in a haze of thick smoke near the Eleventh Brigade.\nWhere his and Ka-poel’s tent had been.\nHe left his horse with the closest soldier and ran deeper into the chaos.\nMen milled about, faces obscured by blood and ashes. Taniel grabbed one\nof them.\n“What happened?”\n“Surprise attack,” the man shouted, pulling aside the handkerchief\ncovering his mouth. “They came from the west, at least a dozen Privileged\nand five thousand men!”\n“Who?”\n“Kez!”\nTaniel shoved the man aside and stumbled toward where he thought\nhis tent had been. Five thousand men? A dozen Privileged? The Kez had no\nPrivileged left of any power, and how could they possibly have gotten close\nenough to launch a surprise attack? The smoke muddled his senses and the\ndarkness disoriented him. The tents in this area were all gone, all burned to\ncinders. He plowed onward, knowing he’d have to trust to luck as much as\nmemory to find Ka-poel.\nHe caught sight of a prone figure in the grass. It wore Adran blues and\nlay unmoving with a rifle a handbreadth from its outstretched fingers. He\nspotted another body in the gloom, and then another. All Adran. Some of\nthem were little more than charred skeletons, while others looked as if\nthey’d fallen asleep.\nTaniel’s head began to pound, and he pulled his shirt up over his nose\nand mouth to protect him from the smoke. His eyes watered terribly. He\nopened his third eye and, to his horror, found the world drenched in pastels.\nSorcery for certain, then.\nPerhaps these pastels were just a sign of Bo fighting back? Taniel\ndismissed that hope. Not even Bo could unleash this much of the Else in a\nfight. The colors were everywhere, running parallel to the fire in the grass\nand splattered across the bodies of the Adran soldiers like paint thrown\nfrom a bucket.\nWhere was Bo? Where was Ka-poel? Panic set in and Taniel found\nhimself breathing heavily. He nabbed an Adran soldier by the arm. “Bo?”\nThe man shook his head.\n“Where’s Privileged Borbador?”\n“I don’t know, sir.”\nAs Taniel went on, he found more smoldering bodies strewn\nhaphazardly about the camp as if the area had been shelled by enemy\nartillery. Taniel counted more and more dead Kez, and found where the\nAdran soldiers had put up a valiant resistance. Fifty men, all in a line, their\ncorpses charred beyond recognition and only discernible as Adran by the\nremnants of the Hrusch rifles clutched in their hands.\n“Bo! Ka-poel!”\nTaniel tripped and bashed his knee, barely noticing the ashes that\nblackened his new uniform. He pushed himself up and limped onward,"

Rescuers soon joined him, putting out any\nembers and checking bodies.\n“Have you seen Privileged Borbador? Or the savage Bone-eye?”\nEach soldier shook his head.\nTaniel staggered drunkenly through the pandemonium that engulfed\nthe Adran camp. Soldiers pushed past him, and someone collided with his\nshoulder, nearly knocking him off his feet. He stumbled on, mind in a daze,\nuntil he found his father with the Third Brigade, trying to make sense of the\nchaos.\n“Get those fires out!” Tamas shouted. “Olem, I need casualty reports.\nWho the bloody pit attacked us? How many were there?”\n“Kez,” Taniel said. “I saw the bodies. There’s sorcery marks\neverywhere. There were at least a few Privileged. Somebody said a dozen\nPrivileged and five thousand men.”\nTamas responded, “The damage is bad, but it isn’t nearly that bad.\nBloody pit. I thought the Kez didn’t have any Privileged left. Olem!”\n“Yes sir, on it, sir!”\n“I can’t find Ka-poel,” Taniel said.\nTamas whirled. “Olem! Find Ka-poel. I want a dozen men looking for\nher. Taniel, where’s Bo?”\n“I can’t find him either.” Taniel tried to push down the panic that\nthreatened to overwhelm him. His breath came short and his stomach was\ntwisted in a knot of fear. He could still see the pastels of sorcery in the Else\nfloating before his vision and he remembered leaving for the parley at\nTamas’s insistence. Bo had mussed Ka-poel’s hair playfully. “I’ll keep an\neye on little sister,” Bo had said. “Go play politician.”\nTaniel couldn’t stop hyperventilating. His chest felt tight. Beyond\nTamas, Bo and Ka-poel were all he had left in this world. To lose them both\nat once…\n“Taniel,” Tamas said, putting a hand on Taniel’s shoulders even as he\nkept barking orders to his men. “We’ll find her.”\n“If she’s dead, I’ll – I don’t know. I can’t… Bo. She has to be with\nBo.”\n“If she’s dead, then we have bigger problems,” Tamas said, his voice\nsteady. “If Kresimir escapes whatever enchantment she has him under,\nwe’re all dead men.”\nTaniel grabbed Tamas by the lapels and jerked him around, pulling him\nclose until Tamas’s startled visage was just a few inches from his face. “Ka-\npoel matters more than that bloody god!”\nTamas slapped him across the face, a distant stinging in Taniel’s\npanicked world. “Get ahold of yourself, boy!”\nTaniel took a step forward, blinded by rage. He raised one fist, but he\nand Tamas were suddenly pushed apart.\nBo’s apprentice shoved her way between them. “Both of you, stop it!”\nshe said. “Find Ka-poel! Find Bo!

Come quickly!”\nNila had no time to reflect on the fact that she had just stepped between two\nof the strongest, most deadly powder mages in the world. She had no time\nto think of her fire or her anger. Even the men who followed upon her heels\nbarely touched upon her mind.\nBo could be dead.\nOnce Tamas and Taniel had been pulled apart, a soldier led them all\nthrough the smoke and gloom, torch held over his head. Nila stumbled as\nshe ran, her trembling hands betraying her. The burned grass quickly gave\nway and clods of dirt fouled her already uncertain step. The torchlight\nplayed upon the smoke and then upon immense shapes reaching into the\nnight.\nTamas was called away, and he told them to go on ahead and find Bo,\nthen took off at a run after a messenger.\nThe smoke began to recede and the smell of soil suddenly filled her\nnostrils as if she had stumbled into a damp root cellar. They stood among\nimmense mounds of mud, scooped from the ground as if with a spade the\nsize of a house. She did not open her third eye – she dared not, for fear of\nbeing overwhelmed. She didn’t need to. She could sense the sorcery still\nhanging in the air. Potent sorceries had tilled the ground as easily as a plow\nmight turn a field, and the prospect terrified Nila.\nEarth Privileged, Bo had called them. Capable of manipulating solid\nelements and shaping the very landscape.\nNila was shoved aside as Taniel barreled past her. “Bo? Where is he,\ndamn it? Bo!”\nCould he not sense the power that had been unleashed here? To Nila it\nwas as if the ground might close around her at any moment – a trap waiting\nto be sprung by the unwary. She steadied herself against one of the mounds\nof earth, trying to catch her breath. Her entire body shook from fear.\n“Bo!”\nTaniel’s certain call drew Nila from within herself and she was running\nforward before her own fear could stop her once more.\nBo lay half-buried in the dirt. Black rods, each as thick as a man’s\nwrist and three to four feet tall, peppered the ground around him like a\nsmall forest, rammed into the ground at an angle, and with what appeared to\nbe great force. The stench of spent sorcery was so thick Nila could barely\napproach, and the rods steamed in the chill night air."

The stench of spent sorcery was so thick Nila could barely\napproach, and the rods steamed in the chill night air.\n“Don’t touch those!” Bo’s shrill, frantic warning came just a moment\ntoo late. One unfortunate soldier grasped a rod with both hands and leapt\nback with a howl, leaving several layers of charred skin on the rod. “Damn\nit,” Bo said weakly. His body trembled and sweat poured down his face.\n“They’re bloody enchanted. Fire and earth, woven together to keep them\nhot. I don’t know how long it’ll last, but I’m getting bloody hot in here.”\nThe rods were clustered closely around Bo like a palisade, leaving him\ntrapped and unable to move. She took a torch from one of the soldiers and\nheld it out over Bo to confirm her suspicions. Blood streaked his hands, his\nPrivileged gloves nothing more than shredded ribbons.\n“The rods,” Nila shouted. “We have to get them out! He can’t do it\nhimself. Bring horses and chains.”\nNo one moved and Taniel whirled on the soldiers. “You heard the\nPrivileged. Go!”\nNila ignored them and edged closer to the rods, flinching from the\nheat. “Breathe, Bo, breathe! Stay with me. Is there anything I can do?”\nBo made a soft mewling sound, then said, “Just hurry with the horses.”\n“What happened?” Taniel asked. “Where is Ka-poel?”\n“Oh, I’m sorry. I thought it was pretty obvious we were bloody well\nattacked !” Bo’s voice rose to a crescendo at the end of the sentence.\n“Can you move your hands?” Nila asked.\n“Barely. Whoever that was, she did a number on me.”\n“I should have been here.”\n“You would have been killed.”\n“Bring a doctor,” Taniel shouted. “Where are those horses? You there,\nget shovels. Dig on that side of the slope. We can try to undermine the\nrods.”\nNila hated that she couldn’t do anything. She had no knowledge of air\nor earth sorcery, the two kinds that would allow her to remove the lances\nherself. She counted seven of them and tried to focus on the sorcery that\ncaused the heat. She nudged it with her senses, agonizing on the thought\nthat, had she better knowledge of powers, she might be able to at least pick\napart the wards. “How long are these rods?”\n“I didn’t see, as that bitch was ramming them through me,” Bo said. “I\nwas too busy trying to kill her back. Kresimir, that hurts and” – he lifted his\nhead toward the men digging downhill from him – “Stop that! The shifting\ndirt is grinding that thing against me and it hurts like bloody pit.”\n“One of them’s touching you?” Nila asked.\n“Uh, yeah. That one down there.” Bo waggled his chin. His face was\nred from the heat. Blood and sweat streamed down his face. “You know,\nright about where my knee used to be.”\nNila suddenly felt sick to her stomach. She had thought that the rods\nwere merely meant to immobilize him, that none of them had actually hit\nhim. But his lower body was buried, obscuring the position of his legs…"

But his lower body was buried, obscuring the position of his legs…\n“Where are the horses?” Taniel demanded. “Faster now, boys! These\ndamn things are killing him.”\n“They’re not killing me.” Bo coughed, flecks of blood on his lips.\n“They’re cooking me. Fine distinction.” The quip had no energy.\nNila reached between the rods to touch his hand. She felt his fingers\ncurl around hers. “If I can get your spare gloves onto your hands, will you\nbe able to free yourself?”\n“I’m knackered out, and I think a couple of the fingers on my left hand\nare broken. I couldn’t reach into the Else to save myself,” Bo said, the\nsentence ending in a gasp as the rod at his knee suddenly shifted.\n“Stop digging!” Taniel bellowed.\nNila heard the jangle of harnesses and chains. “They’ve got the\nhorses,” she whispered to Bo. “You’ll be free soon.”\nHorses were backed into place, chains attached to their harnesses and\nthe chains wrapped around the hot lances. The first was pulled out, with\nonly a few pained squeals from Bo. The second and Nila was able to move\ncloser to him. She leaned in and used her sleeve to wipe the grime from\nBo’s brow.\nHe suddenly smiled at her. “How did the parley go?”\n“What?”\n“The parley? Isn’t that where you were?”\n“He’s in shock,” Taniel said. “Where are the damned doctors?”\n“Fine, fine,” Nila reassured Bo. “You should have been there.”\n“Had to protect little sister,” Bo said. He looked at Taniel and his eyes\nseemed unfocused. “Did I? Where is she?”\n“I don’t know!” Taniel said.\n“They came for her. That much was obvious. Cut their way through\nthe brigade. She stabbed one of their grenadiers in the eye with her needle.\nDamn, that girl has spirit.”\nAnother of the lances was jerked out by the horses. The ground shifted\nand Bo, along with the four lances still surrounding him, slid several inches.\n“Who came for her? The Kez?” Taniel demanded. Nila wanted to tell\nhim to back off, but Bo’s eyes were now focused, his confusion gone, and\nhe gave a short nod. “Didn’t recognize any of their Privileged. Well, I didn’t\nget a good look at the one who stuck me, but her aura seemed familiar.\nNothing I can place now. Killed another of them. I think there were two\nmore. The one I killed should be over there somewhere.” He made a vague\ngesture. “Strong lot. I thought you told me all the Kez Privileged were\ndead.”\n“They were supposed to be,” Taniel growled. “Look, Bo, hang in there.\nI have to go find Tamas. We have to make sense of what happened.”\n“Go at it, chap,” Bo said, swinging weakly for Taniel’s chin with his\nfist and missing.\nTaniel was up and gone a moment later. A fourth lance was now out,"

A fourth lance was now out,\nand soldiers had managed to dig the dirt from around Bo’s legs. He lay on\nan incline in the dirt, head back, looking almost peaceful. Nila dared a look\nat his knee.\nIt was completely destroyed. The lance had gone through flesh and\nbone like a knife through butter. His pants from the thigh down were\ncooked away and the flesh of his lower thigh and knee was black and\ncooked. The smell reminded her of the battlefield when she’d killed all of\nthose soldiers, but Nila forced that out of her mind. She couldn’t panic. Not\nnow.\n“Is he dead?” a soldier asked.\n“No, he’s not dead,” Nila said, feeling her heart leap. He wasn’t, was\nhe? “Bo?”\n“Yeah, I’m here.” Bo’s head came up suddenly. “Any of those damned\nengineers coming to help?”\n“They’re still putting fires out,” a soldier said.\n“Oh. Oh, I see. I’ll just lie here and feel myself cook then. Tell them\nnot to rush.”\n“The horses are doing the trick,” Nila said.\n“They won’t for the one in my leg,” Bo said. “That one will be\ndifficult. They’ll need levers and math and all sorts of things.”\n“Go get the engineers,” Nila told a pair of corporals. “Now!” When\nthey had gone, she returned to Bo’s side. “Bo. Bo? Stay with me!”\n“I’m just resting my eyes.”\nShe crouched down beside him and sighed. “Please don’t die.”\n“Not planning on it.”\n“I don’t think most people plan on it.”\nBo seemed to consider this. “You are wise beyond your years.”\n“Shut up.”\n“All right.” He was quiet for a moment, then said pitifully, “This really\nhurts.”\nNila leaned forward and peered at Bo’s knee again. She held up one\nhand and brought fire from the Else to give herself light. The lance was still\nhot, and his flesh was cracked and cooked like meat that had been roasted\nover a flame for hours too long. Bo groaned as the soldiers and their horses\nremoved the fifth lance.\n“It doesn’t hurt as bad as you’d think,” Bo said. “After all, the nerves\nare all dead. But I can feel the heat of it still. Feel it slowly cooking. Pit, I’ll\nbe lucky to ever use this leg again.”\nLucky? Nila had no experience with battlefield surgery, but as far as\nshe could tell that leg was gone. “We’ll get you a healer.”\n“It’ll be a rough job.”\n“We’ll get you the best.”\n“If you insist. Just tell them to leave a blackened scar. It’s more\nroguish that way. And a pit of a conversation starter.”\n“Hush, now,” Nila said.\n“Look, if I stop talking, I’ll probably start crying. And I make it a point\nnever to cry in front of women. Especially ones I hope to bed someday.”\n“Is that so?” Nila climbed to her feet.\n“Yes. Makes me look weak. Women can sense weakness. Oh, sure,"

Oh, sure,\nsome women say they want a sensitive man. But no one ever says they want\na weak man.”\nThere were just two lances left. The sixth would come out easily\nenough, but like Bo said, that seventh would be tricky. It couldn’t just be\ndragged out at an angle by a team of horses. It might rip his leg off\ncompletely, and the shock might kill him. It had to be pulled up and out, as\nstraight as possible. She looked it over carefully. She had no idea as to the\nmaterial – some kind of metal, by the looks of it – but sorcery emanated\nfrom the thing. Earth sorcery, no doubt. With fire to make it hot, and air to\nthrow it.\nBo kept talking to no one in particular. “By Kresimir, this’ll be a\nconversation starter. I can imagine it now. Some fop in last year’s fashion\nsitting in the tavern, showing a gaggle of women some scar and telling them\nhe got it from a knife fight with a man twice his size. And then, Bam! I lift\nmy pant leg and show them how the strongest Privileged I’d ever seen\nblasted a lance of sorcery-hewn metal through my kneecap.”\n“You’ll leave out the crying part?”\n“I’m not crying, I… What the pit are you doing?”\nNila ignited the fire around her hands. It came as easily as a thought\nand a twitch of her fingers, and she didn’t have time to wonder at that. She\ntapped the lance hesitantly. When it didn’t burn her, she grasped it with both\nhands, set her foot on the ground beside Bo’s leg, and pulled.\nHis scream almost made her lose her nerve, but she pulled harder,\nsliding the pole out of his knee like a needle through cloth. It came loose\nwith a jerk and she fell backward, lance in hand, then tossed it away before\nshe hit herself in the face with it.\nBo’s body spasmed as he was wracked with sobs. He jerked and\nscreamed, curling on his side and clutching at his blackened ruin of a leg.\nShe threw herself to the ground beside him and took him by the hand. “I’m\nsorry, I’m sorry! It’s out now!”\nHe wept uncontrollably for a few moments. “All right,” he said\nbetween sobs. “I’ll leave out the crying.” And he sagged against her.\nNila checked his pulse with one hand and then let herself slump beside\nhim. He was still alive.\nGuilt began to crowd her thoughts. Perhaps if she’d been here, she\ncould have helped. She could have turned that Privileged into a lump of\ncharcoal and… and who was she kidding? She was an apprentice. She\nwould have been killed outright. Bo was very powerful, clever, and trained,\nand he had only barely survived the battle.\nWhere were the damned doctors? Wasn’t Taniel sending help? Where\nwas he now? Probably going after his savage girl. After all the worry Bo\nhad showed for him, Taniel couldn’t just stay here to comfort his friend who\nmight be dying?"

    "text": "was he now? Probably going after his savage girl. After all the worry Bo\nhad showed for him, Taniel couldn’t just stay here to comfort his friend who\nmight be dying?\nShe looked down at Bo. He gave out a light whimper when she moved\nhis arm out of the way of the wound. She could see through his kneecap.\nHer stomach turned at the sight of it. Would he ever be able to walk\nagain? She’d heard of healers who’d regrown whole limbs, but those had\njust been stories. This kind of damage seemed beyond what anyone could\nheal, no matter their skill.\nShe remembered rubbing her fingers together frantically at the Battle\nof Ned’s Creek and hoping and praying for the right combination of sorcery\nto bring down those men.\nAnd it had worked. She’d killed thousands with a gesture.\nLike from the stories.\nBo said that healers were very rare. That they took great skill. But\nmaybe… maybe she could be something other than a killer.\nNila bit her lip and wiggled her thumb. The aether. That’s what she\nneeded. She reached out for the Else.\n“What the bloody pit do you think you’re doing?” Bo batted her\noutstretched hand weakly to one side. “Are you trying to kill me?”\n“I didn’t do anything.”\n“I felt you reaching out for it. Are you mad? I… oh, pit, this hurts. I\ndon’t know what’s in your head.”\n“I thought that maybe I could just…” She shrugged.\n“You could just heal me? You’re bloody mad, woman, and I’ll have no\ntalk of that. Remember that the aether is a refined matter that creates and\nbreaks bonds. You’re just as likely to make every particle of my body\nexplode as you are to heal me.” Bo grimaced and let out a long whimper.\n“Now, promise me you won’t ever try to experiment like that on me. Ever.”\n“I promise,” Nila said, feeling like a scolded schoolgirl.\n“Good.” Bo let his head fall against the mud.\nThe crew with the horses moved off, leaving the final lance sticking\nfrom the ground, now that Bo was fully free. Three men came out of the\nnight bearing torches. Two were the soldiers who had helped dig Bo out,\nand the third was a doctor.\n“The engineers are coming now,” one of the soldiers said.\n“Never mind the engineers,” Nila told him. “Just help him.”\n“We need to move him out of this,” the doctor said. “Get him to a\nclean tent and bring me hot and cold water and my instruments.”\nThe soldiers lifted Bo onto a canvas stretcher. Nila walked beside him,\nholding him by the hand as they moved out of the blasted battlefield. They\nwere nearly out of the swath of destruction when Field Marshal Tamas\nemerged from the darkness.\n“Bo, are you all right?”\nBo eyed Tamas as a man would eye a meal after having just thrown up.\nHis face was scrunched in pain, but his eyes were clear. “I’ve had better\ndays.”\n“They’ve taken Ka-poel. And her package.”\n“Ah, pit,” Bo sighed.\nNila frowned. She didn’t know what that meant, but what little color\nBo had left in his cheeks was gone."

She didn’t know what that meant, but what little color\nBo had left in his cheeks was gone.\nTamas said, “We’re going back to war. Ipille called us to a truce and\nthen blindsided us. I’ve had runners just now that our allies are ahead of\nschedule. The Seventh and the Ninth will be here soon and the Deliv are\njust behind them. We’re marching south first thing in the morning and\nwe’re going to throw the Kez from our borders. I mean to destroy Ipille\nfully for this treachery.”\n“Sounds good. And Taniel?”\n“He wants to – he must go after Ka-poel. If they know what she’s\ncarrying, we’re all dead men.”\n“Bo, what is he talking about?” Nila asked.\nTamas looked at her. His body sagged from exhaustion and his face\nwas creased with lines of worry and fear. “Not something to discuss in the\nopen, my dear.”\nNila seethed. What did he mean by that? Did he not trust her? Did he\nnot trust Bo? She felt Bo’s hand on her arm and he whispered, “I’ll tell you\nlater.” He let out a hiss and suddenly writhed in her arms.\n“I’ll give you mala for the pain,” the doctor said, searching his bag.\n“Do you see this?” Bo thrust a finger at his charred leg. “I’m not\nsmoking anything!”\n“You’re in shock.”\n“I’m cooking, that’s what I am. Get me whiskey. Lots of it.”\nThe doctor looked to Nila as if for some kind of confirmation. Not\nknowing what else to do, she nodded.\n“The Deliv healers will be here within a couple of days,” Tamas said.\nHis face was impassive.\n“I don’t think he should wait that long.”\n“Get a carriage,” Tamas snapped to one of his men. “We’ll send him to\nthem.”\n“I’m going with him,” Nila said.\nBo gave Tamas a sudden, wolfish grin. “Get me patched up and me\nand Tan will go after the savage.”\n“You’re going to the Deliv army,” Tamas said sternly. “Taniel has\nalready left. Olem is gathering a squad to send after him. And you, my\ndear” – he turned his eye toward Nila – “you’re staying here.”\n“What do you mean? I’m not leaving Bo alone.”\n“He’s a grown man.” Nila didn’t like the dangerous glint in Tamas’s\neye. “You,” he continued, “I’m going to unleash on the Kez.”\nCHAPTER 23\nT\naniel rode alone into the night.\nHe urged his mount as hard as he dared – the horse would have to\ncarry him for as long as it took to catch up with Ka-poel’s captors and he\ncouldn’t risk riding it into the ground.

It was a curious direction, as their main force\nwas to the south, but Taniel thought that they would follow the road into the\nforest and then turn south, thus avoiding the bulk of Tamas’s army that\ncamped on the plain.\nCatching them wouldn’t be easy. They had planned for this, after all –\na dash into the camp with less than two hundred grenadiers but four\nPrivileged, torching everything in their way until they reached Ka-poel and\nthen immediately retreating. They would have a nearby camp, including\nspare horses and maybe even more men.\nThe chain of command left in charge of the Adran forces was still in\nsome confusion after Hilanska’s betrayal, and they had not mounted an\nimmediate expedition. Nor should they have. Without powder mages their\nmen would have been torn apart.\nAnd now the Kez would be fleeing with the fear of god in them,\nknowing that Field Marshal Tamas and his mages would be on their heels.\nThe sky grew light as Taniel continued on, sleep held at bay with the\nlow buzz of a distant powder trance. The terrain grew more jagged as he\nneared the mountains, the air warmer as dawn approached, and he worried\nfor his weary horse. He stopped at a farm just off the main road, where a\nsleepy farmer confirmed that he’d heard a large company of men on\nhorseback pass in the middle of the night.\nDespite the reassurance he was on their trail, Taniel began to worry\nmore with every mile. Was Ka-poel even still alive? If they knew about her\nand about Kresimir, why wouldn’t they have killed her outright? How did\nthey know about her? What was he going to do once he caught up with\nthem?\nThe doubt began to work its way deep and to spread. There were too\nmany of them. Even after the damage Bo did to their party – it was\ndoubtless a surprise for them to find a Privileged in the Adran camp – they\nstill had at least three Privileged and fifty men. One Privileged and a squad\nor two, Taniel could handle. Pit, he could take two Privileged. But three was\ntoo many.\nIt was made all the worse by the knowledge that he’d left his best\nfriend to die alone. No one could survive that kind of damage, not even a\npowder mage. Bo may be hardier than most Privileged, but he would be\ndead within a day or two, and Taniel hadn’t even said good-bye. He had left\nin a panic to try to retrieve Ka-poel and he knew he’d regret it for the rest of\nhis life.\nHe forced the thought out of his mind. There was nothing he could do\nabout it now. He had to save Ka-poel.\nTamas said he would send help, but Taniel knew whoever Tamas sent\nwould move too slowly.\nTaniel rode across the farmlands of Adro for another hour before the\nsun finally rose over the Adsea behind him, illuminating the Charwood Pile\nMountains ahead and the Black Tar Forest, which spread out at the"

    "text": "Taniel rode across the farmlands of Adro for another hour before the\nsun finally rose over the Adsea behind him, illuminating the Charwood Pile\nMountains ahead and the Black Tar Forest, which spread out at the\nmountains’ base. At the top of a particularly high rise, he sniffed a pinch of\npowder and squinted across the fields.\nSomething moved in the distance.\nHe took another sniff to sharpen his eyes, increasing the strength of the\ntrance. He could make out a trail of dust from a large group of riders off in\nthe distance. They were at least fifteen miles away and they would be inside\nthe forest within an hour.\nHe was curious why they had not tried to cut across the plains, but\ndecided that his initial suspicion was correct. Once within the forest, they\nwould turn south at the Counter’s Road, taking them to Surkov’s Alley and\nthe protection of the Kez army. They would be inside of Kez-held lands\nwithin two days, even taking this roundabout way.\nTaniel considered cutting across the farmlands to the southwest\nhimself. But there was no good way to do it. Trying to navigate the forest\nwould slow him down and he might miss them entirely. Far better to come\nup from behind and pick them off one by one from a distance. But even\nthen, could he do it quickly enough before they reached the main army?\nHe felt the weight of despair in his stomach like lead shot. He wasn’t\ngoing to be able to get her back. They would kill her and free Kresimir, and\nthen Adro would fall. Mihali – Adom – wasn’t here to protect them\nanymore.\nA movement a few miles off caught his eye. He blinked several times\nto let his eyes refocus, and scanned the horizon. He saw just an old\nfarmstead. Short, with stone walls and a thatched roof. He likely saw the\nfarmer making his morning rounds. Nothing to get excited about.\nTaniel was just about to dismiss the farmstead entirely when something\nnew caught his eye. Near the edge of the farmhouse, he made out a uniform\nof green-on-tan, with a tall black cap with red accents. The man was\ncrouched by the side of the building, staring straight toward Taniel. Without\na powder trance, it was unlikely he could even see Taniel.\nAn ambush. How many men, Taniel couldn’t say. He would guess at\nleast a dozen. He opened his third eye and looked again, but was unable to\nsee any sign of a Privileged anywhere near the farmstead. Did they have air\nrifles? He wished he had asked about that before he left the Adran camp.\nTaniel would need to get closer to find out.\nHe threw his bedroll down and caught an hour of sleep before he\ncontinued on, knowing it was his last chance at rest in the near future. Back\nin the saddle, he crossed the distance of a little over three miles at a trot so\nthat the sun would be just over his shoulder as he approached.\nWhen he was a half mile away, he checked with his third eye again. No\nPrivileged and no Knacked. But these men would be grenadiers – as with\nAdran grenadiers, they would be bigger, stronger, and better trained than the\naverage soldier.\nAt a quarter mile, Taniel slid from his saddle and staked out his horse"

He put two pistols into his belt, fixing the\nbayonet onto his rifle and holding it across his chest.\nHe reached out with his senses, looking for powder, and he found it\nquickly. Powder horns, charges, loaded weapons. He sorted the information\nin his mind, assessing the arsenal of each man, and guessed there were six\ngrenadiers.\nA piss-poor ambush. Likely just meant to slow down pursuers, not stop\nthem entirely.\nEither way, these six were not ready for a powder mage. They were in\nfor a damned big surprise… unless one of them had an air rifle. Then Taniel\nwas in for a surprise. But nothing he could do for that.\nHe could sense the first grenadier behind a haystack a hundred and\nfifty yards away. Taniel took a deep breath, set his rifle to his shoulder, and\npulled the trigger. He burned a little powder behind the bullet to make sure\nit went through the haystack. The crack of his rifle was quickly followed by\na scream.\nTwo grenadiers immediately came around the corner of the farmhouse.\nTheir muskets cracked and powder smoke rose over their heads, but they\nweren’t going to hit anything at this distance. Taniel had already rammed a\nbullet down the end of his rifle, sans powder, and lifted it to his shoulder.\nHe burned a powder charge in one pocket to propel the bullet and took one\nof the grenadiers through the eye. The second threw himself back behind\nthe house.\nTaniel broke into a sprint toward the farmhouse. He rolled as a\ngrenadier appeared from a nearby ditch. The man’s musket belched smoke\nand Taniel heard the bullet whiz by. Too far to ignite the man’s powder, but\nclose enough…\nHe let go of his rifle as he came out of his roll and drew a pistol. He\nfired, adjusting the trajectory of the bullet with his mind in the fraction of a\nsecond it took to cross the distance and lance the man’s heart. The grenadier\nfell.\nThree down, three to go. Taniel’s heart sang as he moved, blood\npounding in his ears, feeling the rhythm of the battle. A bullet skipped off\nthe ground beside his foot, and he looked to see the grenadier hidden on the\nroof of the farmhouse. Taniel hesitated between reloading his rifle and\ndrawing his second pistol and decided instead to finish his sprint toward the\ncover of the house. Another grenadier rounded the corner of the farmhouse\njust as Taniel reached it. The soldier raised his musket.\nTaniel ignited the grenadier’s powder horn and used his mind to warp\nthe blast away from himself.\nA slight movement above him was his only warning as the grenadier\nfrom the roof leapt down, knife drawn.\nTaniel caught the grenadier’s knife thrust with the stock of his rifle. He\nshoved, trying to push him away in order to thrust with his bayonet, but the\ngrenadier grasped the musket with one hand and stabbed again. Taniel was\nonly able to avoid the thrust by throwing himself against the stone wall of\nthe farmhouse.\nThe grenadier followed through, his face furrowed in anger as he"

Taniel let\ngo of his rifle and snatched the grenadier’s wrist, slamming his opposite fist\ninto the man’s knee.\nThe grenadier screamed. Taniel wrenched on his wrist, pulling him\ndown to the ground, and rolled on top of him. He had the grenadier’s knife\nnow, and he wrapped one hand around the hilt and slammed it into the\ngrenadier’s face.\n“Where’s Ka-poel? The savage girl! What have you done with her?”\nTaniel waited a moment, then punched him again. “Tell me!” Why was he\ndoing this? He already knew. What could this bastard possibly tell him?\nTaniel drew his second pistol and pressed it against the grenadier’s\nforehead. “Is she still alive? Tell me now!”\nThe grenadier spit blood in his face.\nTaniel felt the pistol jerk in his hand, the crack of the blast in his ears,\nand the grenadier’s body beneath him stiffened then sagged. Slowly, he\nclimbed to his feet and tossed the spent pistol aside.\nHe’d wanted answers. He’d wanted to hear his fears confirmed.\nTaniel looked to one side as the sixth and final grenadier came out of\nhis hiding place and advanced, musket leveled. Taniel took a deep breath.\nShit. In his excitement, he forgot about the last one. Too far to ignite the\ngrenadier’s powder, and too close for the grenadier to miss him.\nA stupid mistake, and it had just gotten him killed.\nTaniel flinched away as the grenadier jerked to one side and fell. His\nmusket landed on the hard-packed road with a clatter, and blood seeped\nfrom his head to pool on the ground. Taniel took a shaky breath and\nsquinted into the sun, but couldn’t make out anything in the glare. His\nbackup must have arrived. No one else was close enough to make that kind\nof a shot. He would have sensed them.\nTamas must have sent another powder mage. But who? Had the rest of\nthe cabal caught up to Tamas? Had Tamas himself come? Taniel felt some\ndread in the pit of his stomach, because he thought he knew who it might\nbe.\nNo use staring into the sun, trying to see who had shot the grenadier.\nTaniel checked the bodies more closely and found each of the grenadiers\ndead or very near so. His knife finished the job on two of them. No sense in\nletting men suffer, and they weren’t going to answer questions in their state.\nHe finished his inspection, checking for other grenadiers he might\nhave missed, and gathered and reloaded his weapons, then walked toward\nwhere he’d left his horse. He was just climbing into the saddle as the rest of\nhis hunting party crested the nearest rise. He bent over his saddle, eyes\nclosed, resting as he waited for them to catch up.\n“What are you doing here, Captain?” he asked when he heard their\nhoofbeats come to a stop nearby.

He had called her “Captain” out of spite.\nVlora’s cheeks flushed, but she only lifted her chin. “I’m here to help.\nWe’re going after those bastards.”\n“I can’t give orders to a colonel,” Taniel said. “And I don’t think you\nshould lead the expedition.” The words came out harsher than Taniel had\nmeant, but he had wanted them to sting. It felt like years had passed, but\nshe’d been his fiancée less than seven months ago, when he found her in the\narms of another man. Ka-poel’s capture already had him on edge. He wasn’t\nready to deal with Vlora.\n“You’ve been promoted as well, Colonel,” she said, holding out her\nhand.\nHe took the colonel’s pin and held it up to the light. “First major, then\nthis? I don’t deserve it.”\n“The field marshal feels otherwise. And he needs to fill spots from\nofficer casualties, so…” She trailed off. “You’re in command, Colonel.”\nTaniel pinned the bars to his lapel with some reluctance.\nHe put Vlora out of his mind to examine the rest of the group. Gavril,\nthe Watchmaster, which was a surprise. Taniel hadn’t seen him since he left\nthe South Pike Mountainwatch to pursue Julene and the Kez cabal. In\naddition to Gavril there were three more powder mages, and a dozen more\nsoldiers wearing the emblem of Olem’s Riflejacks. The Seventh and Ninth\nmust have arrived not long after Taniel left, and Tamas had sent his best\nmen.\nThe despair began to melt away and Taniel felt his resolve harden.\nThis wasn’t a hopeless cause anymore. He could – he would – get Ka-\npoel back.\nCHAPTER 24\nT\namas was livid.\nHe guided his horse through the Adran camp at a walk, only half\nlistening to Olem as he gave his morning report.\nIpille had betrayed him under a white flag. There were certain rules of\nwar that Tamas found idiotic and others he found snobbish. He would\nopenly flout such rules if it suited him, but the white flag of parley was\nsacrosanct. It was how peace was made, and for Ipille to have attacked\nTamas’s camp even while he sat in truce with Tamas was…\nTamas couldn’t find words to express his anger.\nThe remnants of the Seventh and Ninth that had survived their march\nthrough Kez had arrived just an hour after Taniel had left. Colonel – now\nGeneral, as of his arrival at the camp – Arbor had double-marched the men\nthroughout the afternoon and much of the night to arrive far ahead of\nschedule. Tamas had immediately taken volunteers from among his best\nmen and powder mages and sent them after Taniel, and now the rest of his\ntwo best brigades were sleeping off their long march as he tried to decide\nwhat to do with them."

Olem had stopped talking. “Go on,” he\nsaid.\nOlem immediately drew a cigarette from his pocket and clenched it\nwith his lips. “You’re doing that thing you do, sir.” He produced a match\nand lit his cigarette.\n“What thing?”\n“Where you pretend you’re listening but you’re thinking about\nsomething else.”\n“I was not.”\nOlem puffed on his cigarette. “Whatever you say, sir.”\n“One of these days I’m going to have you shot for that insubordinate\ntone, Olem.”\n“Of course, sir.”\n“Pit, you’re insufferable.”\n“You did make me a colonel.”\n“What does that have to do with anything?”\n“I’ve met a lot of colonels, sir. They’re all insufferable.”\nTamas waved some cigarette smoke away from his face. “What about\nArbor? He was a colonel until a few hours ago, and you always seemed to\nlike him.”\n“Have you played cards with General Arbor, sir?”\n“No.”\n“He’s insufferable too. Likable, but insufferable.”\n“Can one be both?”\n“He is.”\n“Pit. I don’t have time for this. What were you telling me before?”\n“A report on our powder stores, sir.”\n“Do we have enough for an extended campaign against the Kez?”\n“Yes. Barely. Despite the Brudanians holding Adro, we’re still getting\nshipments from Ricard’s businesses. Even more now that General Ket isn’t\nthere to skim off the top.”\n“Good. Then skip the report. Anything else important this morning?”\nOlem addressed the stack of notes in his hand. He flipped through\nthem, grumbling to himself. “Beon je Ipille arrived with the Seventh and\nNinth. He’d like to meet with you at your convenience.”\n“It can wait. If I see one of Ipille’s spawn right now, I’d probably shoot\nhim in the heart. And I actually like Beon. Have all of my promotions gone\nthrough?”\n“Most of them,” Olem said. “All senior officers will be waiting for you\nin your tent at eight o’clock.”\nTamas checked his pocket watch. “We’d better finish this quickly,\nthen.”\n“Of course, sir.” Olem shuffled through his papers and cleared his\nthroat.\n“What is it?” Tamas’s mind was already drifting back to Ipille. He\ncould feel the bile in the back of his throat, and it wasn’t hard to envision\nputting his bayonet through Ipille’s prodigious gut.\n“There’s one more thing, sir.”\n“Spit it out!”\n“Me, sir.”\n“What in the Nine are you talking about?”\nOlem put his papers away in his saddlebag. “Things are a bit\nconfusing, sir.”\n“You’re my bodyguard, aren’t you?”\n“Yes sir. That’s what’s confusing.” Olem shifted in his saddle and\ncleared his throat.\nTamas’s patience was wearing thin. “Get to it.”\n“You made me a colonel. Colonels, traditionally, aren’t bodyguards or\naides-de-camp.”"

Colonels, traditionally, aren’t bodyguards or\naides-de-camp.”\nWas this so important that Olem had to bring it up right this instant?\nMost men don’t usually go from sergeant to colonel in the space of eight\nmonths, either, but Tamas had promoted Olem nonetheless because it fit his\nneeds. “True,” he said.\n“I don’t think I deserve to be a colonel, sir. I’d like you to demote me.”\nTamas stared at Olem. “This? Again?”\n“Yes sir. I don’t have my own command. Keeping me a colonel but\nalso your bodyguard and aide doesn’t make sense. I don’t mind the\ndemotion at all.”\n“You don’t mind…? Damn it, Olem. You’re going to mind what I tell\nyou to mind. You want a command? You have one now.”\n“Sir?”\n“The Seventh is yours.”\nOlem’s cigarette fell out of his mouth. “But sir! You were going to\ngive the Seventh to Colonel – I mean General – Arbor.”\n“General Arbor has the First and the Third. They’ve been humiliated\nby Ket and Hilanska’s treason and he’s going to whip them into shape. You\nwill combine the best men from the Seventh and the Ninth to form the new\nSeventh, which will be called the Marshal’s Own Riflejack Brigade.”\nOlem sat up straight.\nTamas continued. “You don’t have a lot of command experience, but\nyou know people. I’ll leave it to you to choose your officers. Choose them\nwell, because you’re still going to spend most of your time with me.”\n“Are you certain, sir?”\n“Of course.”\n“You’ll need a new bodyguard.”\n“No, I won’t.”\n“Uh, sir?”\nTamas leaned over to Olem and slapped him on the shoulder. “You’re\nstill my bodyguard, and the whole damn Seventh will be too. There’s no\none else I trust to watch my back.”\nFor once, Olem had no snappy comeback. “Thank you, sir. I’m\nhonored.”\n“Don’t be honored. Just do your job. Now, let’s go meet with the\nsenior staff. We have an offensive to plan.”\nTamas met his senior officers in his command tent in the center of the\ncamp.\nRoughly twenty-five men and women had crammed inside the tent:\ngenerals and colonels from most of the brigades. More than half of the faces\namong them were new officers, recently promoted, and Tamas knew he still\nhad almost a dozen promotions to make before the end of the day. The\nWings of Adom brigadiers were conspicuously absent. Lady Winceslav had\nbeen true to her word and withdrawn all but a token force from the front\nlines.\nBecause of the lack of the mercenaries and the inexperience of his new\nofficers, Tamas knew this conference couldn’t wait. The officers – and their\nmen – needed to know where they stood.\nTamas entered through a slit at the back of the tent, hiding his limp and\nthe pain in his side as he quietly took his place at the head of the gathering.\nOlem was already waiting.

He’d spread a few papers on Tamas’s desk:\ncasualty figures, regiment strengths, the names of new senior officers.\nTamas had gone over all of that hours ago, but it would be good to have\nsomething to reference.\nHe stood behind his desk, hands clasped behind his back, and let his\neyes rest at the entrance of the tent.\nThe seconds ticked by, then turned into minutes. Someone toward the\nback of the group cleared their throat, and Tamas listened to the shouts of a\nquartermaster rise over the general din of the camp.\nFive minutes passed before one of the new generals raised his hand,\nfalse teeth clenched in his fist.\n“Yes?” Tamas asked.\nGeneral Arbor lowered his hand. “We waiting for someone, sir?”\n“We are,” Tamas said. “Olem, would you see if our guest has arrived?”\nOlem ducked out through the back. Several more minutes passed and\nTamas could sense his officers begin to get restless. What was this about, he\nimagined them wondering. Why did he have them waiting here, standing at\nattention like common infantrymen, when they had work to do?\nTamas decided to let them stew. It shouldn’t be longer than a few more\nminutes now.\nTamas wondered if his Riflejacks had managed to catch up with Taniel\nyet. It was an unexpected surprise that the Seventh and Ninth had arrived in\nthe middle of the night, but a welcome one. He needed his best veterans\nmore than ever now, and…\nThe sound of galloping horses cut off his thought. Shouts accompanied\nthe sound – of surprise, but not alarm – from among the soldiers outside.\nTamas could sense his senior officers getting nervous at the sound, and was\nglad to see some of them mimic his stony composure.\nEvery head in the room turned as the tent flap was swept aside. Olem\nstepped inside and announced, “His Lordship, King Sulem the Ninth, of\nDeliv.”\nA murmur among the officers quickly faded into silence as the Deliv\nking swept into the command tent. He held his plumed bicorne under one\narm and wore a Kelly-green officer’s dress uniform, the chest of which was\ncaked in decorations. He was a handsome man with gray hair curled near\nthe scalp, a strong jaw, and white teeth that seemed to shine in contrast with\nhis ebony skin.\nTamas took a deep breath and let it out slowly to calm his nerves. The\nsituation had changed since his last talk with Sulem, and he was not sure if\nDeliv support would change once they were better informed.\nThe Deliv king approached and gave Tamas a short nod. Tamas\nresponded in kind, and watched as Sulem turned to survey the assembled\nofficers.\nTamas had been curious how his officers would react to a king in their\nmidst and was pleased to see them all give the same respectful nod as he\nhad. Sulem may be an ally, but Tamas wanted it to be clear to him – and to\nthe rest of the kings of the Nine – that Adrans did not bow and scrape\nbefore royalty. If anything, Sulem seemed amused. He did not, however,\nreturn their nod."

He did not, however,\nreturn their nod.\nSulem took a place beside Tamas, facing the officers.\nOlem approached and leaned to whisper in Tamas’s ear, “Beon is\noutside. He’s heard an inkling of what’s happened and is demanding to see\nyou.”\n“Restrain him. Gently.”\nOlem disappeared discreetly out the back of the tent and returned a\nfew moments later. “It’s done.”\nTamas cleared his throat to get his officers’ attention. “Thank you for\njoining us, Your Majesty,” Tamas said. He paused to examine his officers\nonce more. Fine men and women, every one of them. People he could place\nhis confidence in, who would stand beside him against the world. He felt a\nsudden tightness in his throat, a cloudiness to his vision, and forced himself\nto choke down the emotion.\n“Five days ago, King Ipille of Kez sued for peace. Not a terrible\nsurprise considering the walloping we gave his army at Ned’s Creek.”\nThere was a round of chuckles, which Tamas let die down on its own. “Just\nyesterday I met with him to begin peace talks that would end this war once\nand for all. The talks went better than I had expected and I returned to camp\nlast night optimistic for the first time in five months that the bloodshed\nwould end.\n“Optimistic until I saw the flames, that is. As you are no doubt all\naware, we were attacked by a contingent of Kez Privileged and grenadiers.\nThe Thirteenth suffered heavy casualties, as did the Seventy-Fifth\nDragoons, which tried to cut off their retreat from our camp. We…” Tamas\nchewed on his cheek for a moment, forcing down his rage. “Well, you all\nhave the report on the attack. It ends with this: ‘We were attacked under a\nwhite flag of parley.’”\nThere was an angry mutter among the officers, and Tamas continued.\n“This is a sin I will not forgive. This war has been one of defensive battles:\nNed’s Creek, Shouldercrown, Surkov’s Alley, Budwiel. We have suffered\nbetrayal and corruption. We have stood before the might of a sick and petty\ngod. Today, my friends, my brothers and sisters, we go on the offensive.”\nTamas paused to think of the foreign army that held Adro, and knew\nthat this was just one of many offensives he would need to rally in the\ncoming days. “Today I march to the enemy camp at Fendale. We will set\nupon the Kez army like a dog on a rat and we will rid this country of\nvermin. There will be no quarter given until every Kez cur has been driven\nfrom our borders. They have sullied our nation for long enough.”\nTamas took another deep breath and clutched his trembling hands\nbehind his back. “Do you march with me?”\nA moment of silence followed, and then General Arbor’s voice rang\nclear. “The First and the Third reporting and ready, sir.”\n“The Seventh is yours,” Olem said.\n“You have the Nineteenth,” General Slarren called from the back."

Finally, when the last zealous cheers had died down, King\nSulem stepped forward. His gaze swept over the assembled officers and\nthen he turned sharply toward Tamas and drew his sword.\nOlem took half a step forward. Tamas’s heart leapt to his throat.\nSulem took his sword by the blade and bowed low at the waist,\nholding the hilt toward Tamas. “You have my sword. You have my pistol.\nYou have my Privileged and artillery. You have my sixty thousand. Our\nalliance will cause Ipille to quake and the Kez will pay for their crimes.”\nTamas couldn’t hide his amazement. He knew royalty. He had been\nhonored by the old Iron King of Adro, as well as by the king of Novi. But\nhe had never experienced anything like this before. Reaching out, he took\nSulem’s sword in hand, then held it over his head.\n“I would die for my country. But I’d rather kill for it. Ready your\ntroops. We march!”\nCHAPTER 25\nA\ndamat’s carriage neared Adopest fifteen days after he’d initially set out\nsouth with Privileged Borbador, carrying a warrant for General Ket’s arrest.\nThe city seemed strange to him when viewed from afar. The red of the\nfall leaves and gold of the fields seemed to hide the brick smokestacks and\nwarehouses of the Factory District, and Adopest seemed less to him than it\nhad been before. It wasn’t until he had lost the view and entered into the\nsouthern parts of the city that he decided why that was so: The Kresim\nCathedral no longer dominated the center of the city, standing like a beacon\nabove most of the other buildings.\nAdamat noted the wreckage of a dozen churches as his carriage wound\nthrough the southern suburbs and then through the Factory District and\nheaded north toward his home. It was four o’clock, the autumn sun already\nwell on its way to the western horizon, when he was dropped at his front\ndoor, and he had worked himself into a fury over Claremonte’s men having\ndestroyed all the churches in Adopest.\nWhat right had they? This was not their city. Not their country. And\nyet no one had opposed them when they pulled the priests from their\nchapels and murdered them in the streets; when Claremonte’s Privileged\nhad torn down the churches with sorcery, laying waste to every brick.\nAn illness had settled in Adamat’s gut and he had the horrible feeling\nthat he should have accepted Tamas’s mission to rid the city of Claremonte.\nSomeone had to fight against the bastard.\nCane and hat in hand, Adamat carried his bag up his front steps and set\nit against the door. He bowed his head. None of that now. Claremonte was\nin the past. Vetas was in the past.

No\nchildren shouting or playing. No feet on the wood floors. He raised his head\nand peered in at the front window, but the shades were drawn. Where was\nhis family?\nHis hands shook as he tried to turn the doorknob, but it was locked. He\nreached into his pocket for the key, only to have it drop from his stiff\nfingers.\nHe bent to retrieve the key and heard the scrape of the lock, and the\ndoor opened. He looked up.\n“Adamat? You’re home, how wonderful!”\nAdamat breathed a sigh of relief, feeling his knees wobble. “Hello,\nMargy.”\nThe foreman of the biggest textile mill in Adro was a strong woman in\nher forties with graying hair and a pair of spectacles perched on her thin\nnose. “Do come in, I was just keeping Faye company for the afternoon. She\nsaid she didn’t expect you for… well, for some time.”\n“Who’s there?” Adamat heard Faye call from the sitting room.\n“I am,” Adamat responded weakly.\n“Oh, hold on!”\nAdamat came inside and put down his bag and hung his hat and cane\nby the door. Faye came out of the sitting room and put her hands on\nAdamat’s shoulders. He leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek, and he\ncouldn’t help but see the look of hope as she smiled at him, and then the\ncloud that passed over her face when he closed the door behind him.\nHe gave a slight shake of his head.\n“Margy,” Faye said, “I’m so sorry to do this, but…”\n“Oh, now, don’t be like that. I should get home to my girls anyway.\nYou should be with your husband.”\n“I’ll stop the cab,” Adamat said. He went back out into the street and\nshouted for his carriage to return. A few minutes later and Margy was\nclimbing inside with her umbrella.\nAdamat forced a smile and waved as the carriage drove off. Beside\nhim, Faye did the same, and he wondered at her ability to face the world\nwith a stiff spine after all she had been through. They went back inside.\n“Margy was telling me she’s going to run for treasurer of her district in\nthe new elections this fall.”\n“Where are the children?” Adamat asked.\nFaye let herself fall against the wall in the hallway. Adamat touched\nthe plaster beside her, noting how it didn’t match the rest. She’d had\nsomeone come and fix the hole there, from where SouSmith had put an\nassassin’s head through plaster and brick.\n“Ricard offered to hire a governess for them full-time,” Faye said. “I\ntook him up on it. They’re off for a walk in the park right now and they’ll\nbe back for dinner in a couple of hours.”\n“Is that safe?”\nFaye made a quiet noise that seemed halfway between a sigh and a\nsob, but did not respond.\n“That was very kind of him,” Adamat added.

When that failed, he\ngave a small nod. Better that she not know. It would break her. To know\nJosep dead was one thing, but to know that he had been twisted by hideous\nPrivileged sorcery into some… creature…\nBetter that no one ever know.\nFaye stared at the floor. She went back into the sitting room and a\nmoment later Adamat heard her muffled sobs. He closed his eyes. How had\nhis life come to this?\nHe took two steps up the stairs, bag in hand, when he turned and went\ninto the sitting room. Faye perched on the edge of one of the chairs, a half-\nempty cup of tea on the table beside her. Adamat knelt on the floor behind\nher and put his hands on her arms. He soon found himself weeping as well.\nAdamat wept until the collar of his shirt was wet and he felt like he\nhad no more tears to give. His legs were both asleep and Faye had\ncomposed herself some time ago and now stared unseeing at the far wall of\nthe sitting room. He kissed her on the forehead and extricated himself from\nher desperate embrace, brushing the dampness from his face with one\nsleeve and clearing his throat.\nShe looked up at him, a sad smile on her lips, and he again wondered\nat her strength to deal with all of this. To hide her own fears and sorrow and\nanger, to put on a happy face for him and the children just a handful of\nweeks after the end of her own ordeals – it was incredible.\n“I worry for you,” he said.\n“I’m stronger than you think.”\n“I know. But I still worry.”\nShe took his hand and kissed his knuckles. “Worry for yourself.”\n“Field Marshal Tamas has returned. He won a great victory against the\nKez.” Without even being there, though I don’t think Tamas wants that to be\ncommon knowledge.\nFaye scowled. “And he’s asked you to do something more for him,\nhasn’t he?”\n“He did,” Adamat admitted.\n“No! You are done with that man and his revolution!”\n“Be still,” Adamat said. “I told him I would not help him any further.”\n“Good.”\n“I did…”\n“You did what? What? You stupid oaf !”\n“I did promise to help Ricard with his election. Not much. I won’t get\ntoo involved. I’m not doing this for Tamas, by the way. I’m doing it for\nRicard. I owe it to him for helping me get you back.”\nFaye stuck her chin out at him. “Owe it or not, if you even walk into\nhis office you’ll get involved. I know him.

We can take the children and go to Novi. We have the money\nBorbador gave us.”\nAdamat wanted to. He really did. Part of him said he would be a\ncoward to do it – he would be running away. But another part told him it\nwas the smart thing to do. The best thing for his family. “I can’t just\nabandon Ricard,” he said.\n“But you can abandon your family?”\n“I’m not… I…” Why couldn’t she understand? She and the children\nmeant everything to him, but he had obligations. To Ricard. To Adro.\nFaye pushed his hand away. “Fine. Do what you want. You always\nthink you know best.”\nHer next words were drowned out by a knock on the door. “Are you\nexpecting someone?” he asked.\nFaye shook her head. “The children would come in through the back,\nbut they shouldn’t be here for an hour yet.”\nAdamat approached the front window slowly and moved the curtain\naside with one finger. When he saw who it was, he ran to the door and\nthrew it open.\nSouSmith stood on his front step, hat in hand, a scowl marring his\nbattered face. The old boxer gave Adamat a nod, then an “Evening, ma’am”\nto Faye.\n“Come in, come in,” Adamat said. “I just arrived home. I was going to\ncome see you tomorrow.”\nSouSmith shook his head at the invitation.\n“What is it?” Adamat asked.\n“There’s been a bombing,” he grunted.\nAdamat felt his heart skip a beat and his palms begin to sweat. “What?\nWhere?”\n“The Holy Warriors of Labor.”\nRicard’s headquarters. A flurry of questions ran through Adamat’s\nhead and they all jumbled up, causing him to feel tongue-tied. He looked at\nFaye.\n“Go,” Faye urged.\nAdamat snatched his hat and cane and followed SouSmith out the door\nto the waiting carriage.\nAdamat eyed the light street traffic and silently urged the carriage faster. “Is\nRicard hurt?” he asked.\nSouSmith shrugged.\n“How about his secretary, Fell?”\nAnother shrug.\n“Damn it, man, do you know anything?”\nSouSmith shook his head. “Was in Forswitch when I heard.”\n“So you weren’t there?”\n“Just thought you’d want to know.

SouSmith cracked his knuckles and peered out the window.\n“Carrying meat. Big hogs, one on each shoulder.”\n“Been boxing lately?”\nSouSmith kept his gaze on the street outside.

It\nseemed strange that SouSmith had had no matches since then. He was old,\nsure, but he hadn’t lost his edge. Why wouldn’t the Proprietor put him in\nthe ring? Unless…\n“Has the Proprietor suspended all of the boxing?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Because of the eunuch’s death?” An event that had occurred during\nVetas’s capture. In fact, Vetas himself had killed the eunuch during Faye’s\nrescue.\n“Still looking for a new second,” SouSmith said.\n“I see.” The Proprietor was the head of the criminal underworld in\nAdro, and the eunuch had been the face of his operations for at least\neighteen years. It had to be stirring up plenty with the eunuch gone. After\nall, only five people in the world knew the Proprietor’s true identity,\ncounting the Proprietor himself.\nAnd Adamat.\nAdamat cleared his throat. “I might have some work for you soon,” he\nsaid, though he immediately regretted it. Hiring SouSmith meant that he\nneeded a bodyguard. And needing a bodyguard meant he was going to get\ninvolved with things he knew he shouldn’t. But someone had tried to kill\nRicard.\nSouSmith raised one eyebrow. “Hmm.”\nFor the tight-lipped boxer, it was an enthusiastic response.\nNight had fallen, the street lanterns were being lit, and most of the\nshops were closed by the time they neared Ricard’s headquarters. The\nevening traffic was blocked, so Adamat paid the driver, and he and\nSouSmith walked the rest of the way. Adamat peered into the hazy darkness\nto try to see what damage Ricard’s old warehouse had taken.\nTwo of the windows high up on the second floor had blown out, and\nthe front door had been taken off its hinges in order to maneuver stretchers\nthrough. The brickwork appeared unhurt, and in fact the new mural on the\nside of the building with Ricard’s face and election slogan of “Unity and\nLabor” was barely scratched. A prison carriage – empty – blocked traffic in\nthe street, and a dozen police officers milled about, speaking with onlookers\nand each other. Torches had been posted to supplement the light from the\nstreetlamps.\nOne of the officers stepped up to Adamat. “Sorry, sir, no one’s allowed\nin or out, on the commissioner’s orders.”\n“I’m Inspector Adamat. Is Ricard all right?”\nAnother officer looked up from his interview of a scantily clad serving\ngirl – one of Ricard’s hostesses. “Hey, Picadal, you can let Adamat through.\nThe commissioner will want to see him.”\n“The commissioner is here in person?”\n“Yes. Says it’s a high-profile attack, what with Ricard being a\ncandidate for First Minister.”\nAdamat was waved past. When he turned to SouSmith, he found the\nbig boxer lagging behind. “Come on,” Adamat said.\n“I’ll wait here.”\n“What is it? Oh, never mind. Suit yourself.” Adamat headed inside,\nwhere he paused to take in the building for a moment, logging every detail\nin his perfect memory for future perusal."

Suit yourself.” Adamat headed inside,\nwhere he paused to take in the building for a moment, logging every detail\nin his perfect memory for future perusal.\nWhile the building was, indeed, an old warehouse, Ricard had gutted\nthe entire thing and improved it with paint, red curtains, gold candelabras,\ncrystal chandeliers, and busts of philosophers. The headquarters of the\nNoble Warriors of Labor had enough gold trim to make a duke blush. Most\nof the building was one large room, with offices for business in the very\nback.\nIt didn’t take an experienced investigator to see that the explosion had\ncome from the back of the warehouse. For one thing, the offices no longer\nexisted. Blackened wreckage was all that remained of those rooms and, in\nfact, the better part of the rear wall of the warehouse. The parts of the\ninterior that hadn’t been caught in the explosion had been subsequently\ndamaged by fire. Only the very front of the great room had escaped the\nworst of the blast.\nAdamat was stunned by the destruction. There could easily have been\na full barrel of gunpowder hidden inside one of those rooms, or beneath\nthem, in order to cause such damage. No mean feat in a building with this\nmuch traffic during all times of day.\nPolicemen picked through the wreckage alongside some of the union\nmen, trying to save scraps of important documents and pieces of furniture.\nThere was no sign of Ricard. Adamat suppressed his rising panic and turned\nto one of the policemen.\n“Have you seen Ricard Tumblar?”\n“Around the side.”\nA side door, completely intact despite the damage to the rest of the\nbuilding, led out into an alleyway, where Adamat was relieved to find\nRicard sitting with his back to the building next door. The union boss had\nhis head in his hands. A little farther down the alleyway, Fell was talking\nquietly with the commissioner of police. The whole alley was lit by a pair\nof large lanterns outside the side door.\n“Ricard,” Adamat said gently, squatting next to his friend.\nRicard looked up, his eyes a little distant. “Eh?” he asked, far too\nloudly. “Oh, Adamat, thank Adom you’re here.”\n“Are you all right?”\n“What? Oh, I can’t hear a damned word in this ear. Here, come around\nover here.”\nAdamat moved to Ricard’s other side. “Are you all right?”\n“Yes, yes. Just a little frazzled, that’s all.” He made a vague gesture\ntoward the warehouse. “I’ve lost… well, everything. Thousands of\ndocuments gone. Millions in banknotes. Darilo.”\n“Please tell me you’re insured.”\n“For some of it. Not enough.”\n“Union documents.”\n“Yes.”\n“You’ve made copies? Please tell me you’ve made copies.”\n“Yes, yes.”\n“Then you haven’t lost everything. Who is Darilo?”\n“My bartender. Poor man. I sent him into my office to grab a coat for\nCheris, and then…” He stared absently at the wall of his warehouse. “He’s\nbeen with me for over a decade. I went to his wedding. I had to send word"

I’ll go see her myself tomorrow.” He finally looked over at\nAdamat. “Only fourteen people were killed in the explosion and it’s a\nbloody miracle. There were nearly two hundred of us in there for a party.\nThe heads of the goldsmiths’ and millers’ unions are dead. The head of the\nstreet cleaners’ union is having his leg amputated as we speak. I’ve lost half\nof my hearing. Cheris was hit in the shoulder by flying debris. It’s just…”\nHe trailed off.\n“You’re alive. That’s what matters.”\n“But the campaign…”\n“You’ll recover.”\nRicard met Adamat’s eyes for the first time and Adamat realized that\nRicard was still in shock. “Several of my friends were in there.\nRelationships. Money. Time. Resources. All of them lost because of some\ndamn bomb. Who the bloody pit would have done this?”\nClaremonte seemed the likely answer, of course. Ricard’s competition\nin the campaign for First Minister was not a man to trifle with. He would\nnot hesitate to kill hundreds, maybe thousands, to reach his goals. Adamat\nknew from firsthand dealing with his lackey, Lord Vetas.\n“The police will find out.”\nRicard suddenly took Adamat by the collar. “I want you to find out.\nBloody police. They won’t get anything done.”\n“Shh!” Adamat tried making a significant glance toward the police\ncommissioner, who was standing a dozen feet away. Ricard was talking\nvery loudly.\n“Don’t shush me! I’ll pay you anything, Adamat. Just find out who did\nthis!”\n“Calm down, Ricard. I’ll help. Of course I will.” It wasn’t even a\nchoice. Ricard had helped him and Faye with so much over the years. And\nnow, against his will, Adamat was being dragged back into the fray.\nCHAPTER 26\nT\naniel and his group of Riflejacks and powder mages entered the Black\nTar Forest under the cover of darkness the next evening. Wary of ambushes,\nthey pressed on along the road with two men out front at all times, ready to\nspring any traps.\nTaniel felt a pressure in the depth of his chest that urged him forward.\nThey had not yet come across a small, broken, freckled body left to rot\nalongside the road. Ka-poel might still be alive. She had to be. Otherwise\nthey would have killed her during their raid on the Adran camp and been\ndone with the whole affair. They must need her alive, and that prospect\nscared him almost as much as finding her dead.\nWhen he caught these Kez dogs, he would put a bullet through every\nlast Privileged’s brains. He would garrote the grenadiers with their own\nbootlaces. The rage pushed him onward, while a voice in the back of his\nhead warned that he was pushing too hard.\nHe ignored it. What if the Privileged couldn’t kill her? Perhaps she\nshielded herself with the same sorcery that she used to shield him, and they\nwould be forced to keep her prisoner until they managed to unwind her\nwards."

What kind of tortures would they\ninflict on her?\nHe had to get her back.\n“Taniel!”\nVlora’s voice snapped through his thoughts like the sting of a wasp.\n“What is it?”\n“We have to stop.”\n“Already?” He blinked moisture into his eyes, dry from staring into the\nwind as they rode. “Gavril, call the halt. We’ll rotate men.” It was their\npractice these last two days to ride with the two far ahead watching for\ntraps, and to rotate those two every hour. Gavril put his fingers to his mouth\nand gave a shrill whistle, calling the vanguard back toward them.\n“No,” Vlora said, drawing her horse closer and lowering her voice.\n“We have to stop for the night. It’s a miracle none of the horses have fallen\nin the dark. The men are exhausted.”\n“Dark? There’s still plenty of light to see.”\nGavril said a few words to the men and brought his horse stepping\ntoward them. “You’re running a damned powder trance,” he said. “And\nyou’ve been running it too long. Can’t tell the night from the day.”\n“What are you talking about?” Taniel rubbed his eyes and for the first\ntime felt the tension in his shoulders, the ache in his legs. Perhaps it was\npast dark. “The sun must have just gone down.”\n“It’s almost midnight,” Vlora said softly.\nThere was concern in her eyes, and it made Taniel angry. Why did she\ncare? He thought to tell her off and keep the men moving, but a glance\naround the group found them all bleary-eyed and stiff. “We’ll camp here,”\nhe said. “Norrine and Flerrier, take first watch. I’ll take second. Vlora and\nDoll, you take third. We move again at dawn.” He dismounted, putting his\nhorse between him and Vlora, glad to hear her trot off. He’d assigned only\npowder mages to watch, a technique he’d learned from his father for\nsmaller missions. Though the mages were ranking officers, they needed less\nsleep than the regular soldiers.\nIt was twenty minutes before he’d finished rubbing down his horse. He\nmade his camp a little ways from the rest of the men and built a small fire\nusing dry branches, igniting it with a flash of powder. He held his hands to\nthe flames, trying to work the ache from his fingers, regretting the three\ndays straight of clutching his reins.\nThe pressure still pushed on the inside of his rib cage, like some kind\nof wild animal clawing to be free. His own exhaustion was but a shadow in\nthe back of his mind and he had doubts that he would get any sleep until\nKa-poel was free.\n“Norrine and Doll made a quick sweep,” Gavril said, emerging silently\nfrom the darkness of the forest and dropping down beside Taniel. “No one\nlying in wait down the road. It’s safe to make a fire.” He glanced wryly at\nthe flames over which Taniel still held his hands.\nTaniel’s throat was suddenly dry. Pit, what would Tamas say about"

He should have seen to the\nscouts, checked with the sentries, then told the men whether they could\nmake their own fires. “Thanks,” he croaked.\n“Don’t mention it.” Gavril shifted around until he was comfortable, his\nback up against a tree trunk, and produced a flask from his vest pocket.\n“Drink?”\n“No.”\nGavril took a sip. “You eaten yet today?”\n“Of course.” Taniel couldn’t recall. The last dozen hours seemed like a\ndistant memory, a barely remembered dream.\nGavril produced a paper-wrapped parcel and tossed it into Taniel’s lap.\nMarching rations, by the look of it.\n“I’m fine,” Taniel said, handing it back.\n“Eat, you stubborn bastard. By Adom, who the pit you think you are?\nYour father?”\nTaniel bit back a reply and unwrapped the dried beef and biscuits. He\nwas halfway through the meal when he realized that the big Watchmaster\nhad elicited exactly the response he wanted with the comment about Tamas.\nTaniel sniffed and tried to pretend he hadn’t just been manipulated. “You\ndon’t know anything about my father.”\nGavril made a choking sound and rolled onto his side, coughing. “Oh\npit, I just snorted Fatrastan rum up my nose.”\n“What was that about?” Taniel demanded. He had a vague memory of\nsomeone mentioning that Gavril had served with Tamas, but though that\nconversation may have happened just months ago, it felt like years.\n“I said I accidentally snorted rum.”\n“No, I mean when I said, ‘You don’t know anything about my father.’\n”\n“Nothing, nothing. Some other time.”\nGavril fell silent and Taniel chewed on the road rations, swallowing\nmechanically, the hard biscuits having no flavor. Gavril was watching him\neat. The effect was rather unnerving, especially from such a bear of a man.\n“Did you want some?” Taniel asked.\n“Ate hours ago,” Gavril said, taking another sip at his flask. His gaze\nshifted to the small fire.\nTaniel finished the meal and fumbled about for his canteen. Gavril\noffered his flask again and Taniel took it. The rum burned the back of his\nthroat, leaving a slightly sweet aftertaste. “Where’d you get that scar?”\nGavril’s eyebrows rose for a moment, then he looked down to his\nuncovered wrist. A pink line stretched across his broad forearm and ended\non the back of his hand. He shook the sleeve of his jacket down to cover it.\n“You’re too hard on your old man,” he said.\n“Excuse me?”\n“He’s a tough old bastard, but he has tried to be a good father.”\n“That’s really none of your damn business.” Taniel felt the color rise in\nhis cheeks.\nGavril held up his hands in peace. “Sorry, sorry. Just making an\nobservation.”\nThey sat in silence for several minutes while Taniel let his anger cool.\nThe pleasant feeling of a full belly made his eyelids droop and he reached"

Caught\nbehind the lines?”\n“Aye,” Gavril said.\n“Was it bad?”\nGavril was silent for several moments. Taniel watched the side of his\nface, realizing only now that Gavril weighed at least two stone less than he\nhad all those months ago on South Pike. There was a new scar on his right\ncheek, faded in a way that spoke of healing sorcery, and the hint of healed\nbruises around both eyes.\n“It was,” Gavril finally answered. “Killing the horses for food. Being\ndogged by Kez cuirassiers. Gathering up powder and food from the men so\nwe could ration it back out wisely. I had to shoot a man because it was\nfound he had stolen two weeks’ worth of rations.”\nIt sounded like stories Taniel had heard from his father about the\nGurlish campaigns. Except those were decades ago, half a world away. This\nhad just happened in the very heart of the Nine. “Tamas put you in\ncommand?”\nGavril shrugged his big shoulders. “Sure. He needed someone like me.\nYou see the worst of humanity up on the Mountainwatch. Convicts and\ndebtors, thieves and fools. Pit, you remember. Not Adro’s finest, by a long\nstretch. If I could keep that lot in line, I could keep Tamas’s infantry going\nwith one hand and manage the scouts and cavalry with the other.”\n“You’d never boast about it, though,” Taniel said with a snort.\n“A boast is something you have to back up with your fist.” Gavril\nraised one ham-sized hand. “I could let the results do the talking, there.”\nHis sleeve fell, revealing once again the long scar. Gavril examined it for a\nmoment, then said, “I got this from the Kez. They were wearing Adran\nblues and I was ranging too far ahead of the main army. They caught me,\nbeat the shit out of me, and took me to Alvation. That’s where they really\nwent to work on me.”\nHe raised his shirt to show several other scars across his belly.\n“Snapped my wrist when I wouldn’t give them the information they wanted.\nThe bone sheared clear through the skin. God, I haven’t screamed like that\nsince my leg was run over by a wagon as a boy.”\n“Alvation?” Taniel asked. He’d spent just a little time with Olem,\nTamas’s bodyguard, on their way to the parley, and Olem had told him\nsome things about the Seventh and Ninth’s disastrous trek through Kez and\nDeliv. “This just happened?”\n“The Deliv Privileged healers are good at their craft. I told them to\nleave the scars. Gives me more stories to tell.” He paused. “I heard about\nBo. If they can get him to the Deliv healers in time, he’ll come out\npractically unharmed.”\nNot with his leg practically burned off, he wouldn’t. And that was a"

    "text": "Bo. If they can get him to the Deliv healers in time, he’ll come out\npractically unharmed.”\nNot with his leg practically burned off, he wouldn’t. And that was a\nbig “if.” Taniel felt his voice catch in his throat. “Don’t you blame Tamas?”\n“For what?” Gavril belched loudly and took another swig from his\nflask.\n“For getting you caught by the Kez. You were tortured.”\n“Let’s get one thing straight,” Gavril said, a darkness passing across\nhis face. “The only one who got me caught by the Kez was me. And when I\ndid, Tamas came for me. He pushed his men through the pit and made a\ndeal with an old, spurned lover to get me back. Boy, I’ve spurned a few\nlovers, and let me tell you, making good with one of them can be harder\nthan moving a mountain. Especially for a man as proud as Tamas.”\nTaniel was surprised at the outburst. He opened his mouth, but Gavril\ncut him off.\n“I’ve blamed Tamas for a lot of things in my lifetime. He’s guilty of\nsome of them, but as far as the very worst – well, I’ll just say he’s innocent.\nBesides, getting caught by the Kez allowed me one thing I thought I’d\nnever get the chance to do.”\n“What’s that?”\n“I spit in the face of the man who murdered my sister.”\nThe crack of a twig brought Taniel’s attention around to a shape in the\ndarkness. Squinting at it, he realized that his powder trance was starting to\nwear off. A moment later, Vlora stepped into the firelight.\n“Can I have a minute, Gavril?” she asked quietly.\nGavril gave a mighty sigh and climbed to his feet. “Have to take a piss\nanyway,” he muttered, lumbering off into the darkness.\nVlora did not take Gavril’s place, instead settling opposite Taniel\nacross the small fire. Taniel stared into the flames. He could feel her gaze\nupon him, prickling the back of his mind like a sixth sense. The feeling\nbrought back memories of thin sheets and shadowed bedrooms, and he felt\nhis cheeks begin to warm in spite of himself.\nHe took a twig and poked at the fire. “What do you want?”\n“To talk,” she answered softly.\n“Well,” he grunted, “go ahead.”\n“I…”\n“Why are you here?” Taniel demanded, cutting her off. The urge to be\noff, riding fast after Ka-poel, had finally found its outlet, and his words\ncame out much louder than intended. Heads were raised at the other small\ncampfires. “Why,” he asked, tempering his voice, “do you insist on\nhaunting me?”\n“Haunting you?” Vlora was taken aback. “I’m here to help you.”\n“Why? Did Tamas send you? No, I think not. He would have wanted\nyou for the next battle with the Kez. You and I are his best marksmen and\nhe wouldn’t have sent you away at a critical time like this.”\n“I asked to come.”\nTaniel leaned forward until he felt the heat of the fire on his face."

It didn’t matter. He needed an\nanswer. Everything else in his small world seemed unimportant suddenly.\n“We’ve been friends since we were kids. We were lovers. You pulled out\nmy heart and tossed it on the ground.” He gestured violently. “Sprinkled\nsome salt on it and cooked it over a fire!” He thought he heard a chuckle\nfrom the woods, but he paid it no heed. “Why are you mocking me like\nthis?”\nVlora’s face seemed to melt and re-form, the sorrow dripping off and\nbeing replaced by steely-eyed determination. Her jaw clenched and her\ncheeks seemed to tighten, and he could sense the fight in her the way an old\nsailor can sense a coming storm.\n“You think I wanted to be left alone for two years? Until that night you\nfound me, I’d never had a lover but you. Bo kissed me once, when we were\nyoung, but I didn’t let it go farther than that.”\n“He what?” Taniel felt like he was riding a horse that had just thrown a\nshoe.\nShe talked over his agitation. “I took no other lover, but I heard the\nrumors. Taniel Two-shot. Hero of the Fatrastan War for Independence.\nKilling Kez Privileged left and right. Wooing hundreds of women. Tended\nnight and day by a little savage sorceress.”\n“I was never unfaithful.”\n“That’s not what I heard.”\n“Lies! I saw you in the arms of another man. With my own eyes!”\n“I’m sorry!”\nTaniel surged forward, carried halfway across the fire by his own fury,\nthen pulled up short. “What?”\nVlora’s nostrils flared. “That’s the third time I’ve tried to tell you. It\nwas a horrid mistake. You going to Fatrasta. Me taking that prig to bed.\nMistake after mistake after mistake.”\nTaniel returned slowly to his sleeping roll. There was a part of him that\nwanted to rush to her, take her in his arms and comfort her, but he knew that\nwould make things more… complicated. They were done and nothing\nwould change that. He had Ka-poel still. If she was still alive.\nShe thinks I’m lying. The thought hit him like a bolt of lightning from a\nclear sky. She thinks Ka-poel and I have been lovers for these last two\nyears. “Vlora,” he said. The name seemed foreign on his lips, as he’d\nrefused to say it for so many months. “Me and Ka-poel. It’s just been\nrecently, it…” He trailed off. “I just need to get her back.”\n“We’ll get her back,” Vlora said.\nWas it her way of apology? Some kind of self-sacrifice? “Why?” He\nhad to know.\n“Because she still loves you, you daft tit.” Gavril’s voice came out of\nthe darkness to Taniel’s left, and Taniel realized it had been his laugh he\nheard earlier. Taniel surged to his feet, reaching for his sword, swearing to\ncut the big man in two."

Her jaw was set in anger.\nGavril squirmed on the ground, and it took a moment to realize that he\nwas laughing so hard that tears streamed down his face. Vlora planted a\nboot in Gavril’s ribs, eliciting a single “Oof” and then another chorus of\nlaughs. “What’s so funny, you fat bastard?” She grabbed him by the hair,\nlifting him to his knees, and his laughter suddenly ceased. A dangerous\nglint entered his eyes.\n“Vlora…” Taniel stepped forward, ready to throw himself between\nthem.\n“You like putting your nose in someone else’s business, do you?”\nVlora said in Gavril’s ear. “Well, how’s this: Taniel, this hairy ass is your\nuncle. He didn’t tell you on South Pike because he was too ashamed of\nbeing the Mountainwatch drunk, and he doesn’t tell you now because…\nwell, I don’t know.” She kicked Gavril in the small of the back and stormed\ninto the darkness.\nGavril caught himself over the small fire and deftly rolled to his feet.\nHe wiped the tears of laughter from the corner of his eyes and watched\nVlora go, then turned to Taniel.

It had been in the middle of the night over six months ago when\nField Marshal Tamas summoned him in order to investigate the last words\nof members of the Adran royal cabal. The gardens of the great palace had\nbeen dark and unguarded, and instilled him with a deep sense of unease that\nflowed through him even now.\nThough, he acknowledged to himself, his unease this morning was\nlikely of a different sort.\nLord Claremonte was the late Lord Vetas’s employer. And anyone who\nemployed such a monster would surely be a monster himself. Every fiber of\nAdamat’s being told him to turn around and run, to return home and lock\nhis door and never take a job in the city again – and bugger Ricard and\nTamas and Claremonte and everyone else involved in this deadly dance.\nBut he’d made a promise to Ricard, so he straightened his jacket and\ndusted off the brim of his hat.\nMost of the gardens had become overgrown, untended over the\nsummer, and dozens of sentries in the colors of the Brudania-Gurla Trading\nCompany were posted about the grounds. Adamat’s carriage traveled up the\nfront drive, past the immense, silver-plated doors and along the front of the\npalace until they rounded one corner and proceeded to the servants’\nentrance."

The commissioner tipped her\nhat to Adamat and then strode up to a rather ordinary set of double doors\nand rapped twice.\nThe door opened a crack. Words were exchanged, and then the\ncommissioner headed inside, with her officers on her tail. Adamat followed.\n“Keep close,” Adamat said to SouSmith as the big man emerged from\nthe carriage behind him. “I don’t trust Claremonte in the least.” He jogged\nto catch up with the commissioner. “What the pit is Claremonte doing\nhere?” he asked.\n“Running for First Minister,” Commissioner Hewi replied, straight-\nfaced. Hewi – a sharp-eyed, soft-spoken woman with light-brown hair\ncurled tightly beneath a small hat – was wearing a loose-fitting day dress\nthat managed to look both utilitarian and elegant at the same time. She had\nbeen appointed by the Iron King not long before his death and had, from the\nrumors, been one of the first people informed of the coup. Upon hearing\nthat the Iron King’s son was to be executed, her words had famously been,\n“It’s about damn time.”\n“I meant here. In the palace.”\n“He’s rented the space from the city,” Hewi said. “Housing his troops\nand Privileged here.”\n“And we just let him rent it?”\n“The Reeve agreed to it, from what I hear,” Hewi said. “Better than\nletting it sit empty. Claremonte’s paying an astronomical fee for use of the\nbuilding and grounds, and the city needs the money.”\n“I’m surprised Tamas didn’t have the place burned down,” Adamat\nsaid.\n“I’m not. It’s part of our cultural heritage. Over four hundred years old.\nMany of the walls and ceilings are works of art in and of themselves. I think\nTamas knows better than to destroy all that out of spite.”\nAdamat conceded to himself that the commissioner had a point. He\nnoted that even the walls of the cavernous kitchens, as they passed through\nthem, were covered in bright murals.\n“Still,” Hewi added, “Tamas had most of the art and furniture removed\nto the national gallery. Some of it was sold to pay off debts, from what I\nheard. The rest will be put on display for the public. Laudable, I think.”\n“Though it would have been far safer to destroy every vestige of the\nnobility.”\n“Right. Seems Tamas is something more than simply pragmatic. Who\nwould have thought?”\nThey left the kitchens and went up the servants’ stairs to the main\nfloor. Adamat had heard that the passageways behind the palace were a\nlabyrinth all to themselves, but this was his first time experiencing them.\nThey ducked around so many corners, led by one of Claremonte’s servants,\nthat Adamat imagined that men without his Knack could very well get lost.\nHe frequently stopped to urge SouSmith along so that the boxer didn’t get\ndistracted gazing at all the art.\nThey passed by dozens of rooms, each one seemingly bigger than the"

Curtains were drawn in most\nof them, casting the rooms into shadow, and what little furniture was left\nhad been covered in white sheets to keep the dust off.\nThe servant stepped aside suddenly and gestured to a doorway.\nHewi and her officers went inside. Adamat paused momentarily,\nwondering if there was any significance to Claremonte’s having them use\nthe servants’ halls and entrances instead of the immense, echoing hallways\nand full-length doors. Letting them know they were beneath him, perhaps?\nAdamat glanced at SouSmith to reassure himself and then went in.\n“Welcome, welcome!” Claremonte’s voice bounced off the vaulted\nceilings. The room was about thirty feet by forty. Unlike the others they’d\npassed, this one was decorated entirely in silver – metallic paint on the\nwalls, ornate silver-plated trim. Even the dual fireplaces were a marbling of\nlight and dark gray that matched the walls. On the ceiling was a mural\nshowing some ancient hero making a deal with a two-faced celestial being.\nBrude. Fitting that Claremonte would pick a room watched over by\nBrudania’s two-faced patron saint.\nClaremonte wore a fine robe over silk pajamas, though it was well past\nnine in the morning. He lounged lazily in a wingback chair beside one of\nthe windows overlooking the garden and held a cup in one hand, newspaper\nin the other. He stood as they approached, repeating his welcome.\n“I’m sorry I’m not yet dressed, Commissioner. It was a late night last\nnight, working on a campaign speech for a meeting I’m having this\nafternoon with the Society for City Gardens.”\nHewi extended a hand. “Thank you for allowing us to come by on such\nshort notice.”\n“No trouble at all. Oh, Inspector Adamat. Good morning to you, sir.”\n“Good morning,” Adamat said stiffly. He felt a drop of sweat snake its\nway down the nape of his neck.\n“How are your lovely wife and children?”\nAdamat forced a tight-lipped smile. This had been a terrible mistake.\n“I wasn’t aware you knew the inspector,” Hewi said. “Or that you’ve\nmet his family!”\n“The inspector was among those who greeted me upon my arrival to\nthe city,” Claremonte said, a magnanimous smile on his lips. “And I only\nknow his wife by reputation.”\nTo other men, Claremonte’s smile may have been gracious. To\nAdamat, it seemed full of mockery. Claremonte extended his hand to\nAdamat.\n“Pardon if I don’t shake,” Adamat managed.\n“Of course.” The words were almost a purr. “Hewi – may I call you\nHewi? Hewi, I can only assume that you’ve come to ask me about the\nunfortunate incident with Ricard Tumblar yesterday.”\n“That’s true,” the commissioner said.\n“I want to assure you that I had nothing to do with it.” Claremonte\nmoved back to his chair by the window and dropped gracefully into it,"

Eggs?\nCoffee? Biscuits?”\n“Nothing, thank you,” Hewi said. “You understand that we’ll need to\nlook into your records? This case will be very high-profile and you are\nrunning against Mr. Tumblar for First Minister of Adro. You have the\nmeans and the motive.”\n“I understand. Your men are welcome to my records and to question\nmy employees. As long, of course, as it does not interfere with my\ncampaign.”\n“We’ll do our best to keep the investigation discreet.”\n“Many thanks.”\nAdamat let his eyes search the room once more, trying to find anything\nhe had missed – and trying to get his emotions under control. No good\ninspector could allow himself to be ruled by emotion.\nThere were three other chairs aside from the one Claremonte sat in, but\nhe hadn’t offered his guests a seat. The sun blazed through the window,\ncasting long shadows on the floor and inside wall and making it hard to\nlook directly at Claremonte. Strategic placement, or happy coincidence?\nSomething about that bothered Adamat. He couldn’t quite place what\nit was.\nStrategic placement, Adamat decided. A man like Claremonte didn’t\ndo things by accident. Which meant his pajamas were meant to say\nsomething as well. Presenting casual indifference? Disrespect?\n“Lord Claremonte,” Adamat said, interrupting something Claremonte\nhad been saying. “Can you give us any reason why you wouldn’t want\nRicard dead?”\nClaremonte seemed taken aback. “Why, several. For one, attacking Mr.\nTumblar and failing to kill him will only raise his public sympathy.”\n“Or expose your opponent’s weakness.”\n“Perhaps, but he’s very well liked. For another thing, if he had been\nkilled, his Second Minister would have stepped forward to run in his place.\nAnd I have no desire to run against a war hero like Taniel Two-shot. Not\nwith all these rumors going around that he’s killed a god and what other\nnonsense. He’s got a cult of worship among the people almost as deep as his\nfather’s.”\nBut would he step up, Adamat wondered. He decided not to voice the\nquestion, lest it give Claremonte any ideas. “So you think you have the best\nshot of winning with Ricard alive?”\n“Yes. Alive, and in one piece.” Claremonte shook his head sadly.\n“Regardless of who is to blame, some of the public will surely blame me. I\nwould rather the whole event never have happened. I’m in a very good\nplace right now – public perception is high and supporters are flocking to\nme in droves. I’ve just landed an incredible endorsement. The election is\njust over a month away, and anything like this bombing that could\ndestabilize public perception can only work against me.”\n“May I ask who will be endorsing you?”\n“You’ll find out with the rest of Adro in a few weeks. He’s my trump\ncard, if you don’t mind the saying. I don’t want to let out the word too\nearly.”"

I’m sorry to have interrupted, Commissioner,” Adamat said,\nlapsing into silence.\nHewi examined Adamat for a moment and then turned back to\nClaremonte, asking him a series of standard questions. Adamat was pleased\nto hear her go a little harder on him than she would have before\nManhouch’s removal. He had heard from his friends still with the police\nthat investigations were so incredibly easier now that kowtowing to the\nnobility wasn’t a standard part of the job.\nAdamat listened to the questions for several minutes before slipping\nout the front of the room and into the grand hallway of the north wing of\nSkyline Palace. He needed to clear his head. Something in that room\nbothered him. It lurked on the edge of his awareness, tantalizingly out of\nreach.\nHe strolled down the hallway, listening to the click of his cane and the\nheavy footfalls of SouSmith following along behind him. Aside from those\nsounds, the hall was absolutely silent. Strange, what with most of\nClaremonte’s five thousand men stationed on the grounds. He would have\nthought there to be more activity.\nA small sound caught his attention. He followed it, head turned, past\nthree empty sitting rooms and into a fourth, where a series of small\nscratching noises proved to come from fifty pens all writing at once. A\nsalon had been turned into a clerks’ office. Several dozen men sat at desks\nset up in the room, working studiously while a monitor moved up and down\nthe aisles, occasionally bending to whisper to one of the clerks.\nAdamat continued to explore the wing of the palace. He found two\nmore rooms filled with Claremonte’s employees and another with printing\nequipment. The presses were all cold and empty, but they must have been\nused recently, as the room had been lined with cotton batting to keep down\nthe sound. Thousands of newspapers were hung to dry on lines up in the\nvaulted ceiling.\nPrinting his own paper, in addition to the presses he’d bought from\nRicard’s competitors. Smart. “Claremonte seems very confident,” Adamat\ncommented, his words echoing down the hall.\n“Yeah,” SouSmith rumbled. “Too confident.”\n“I don’t like it. Have you heard anything about this endorsement?”\nSouSmith shook his head. “People talk. Some like him. Some hate\nhim. Nothing certain.”\nWell, that wasn’t much help. Adamat drummed his fingers on the head\nof his cane. “Did anything seem strange about Claremonte himself?”\nSouSmith shrugged. “Seems nice enough.” He cracked his knuckles,\nthe sound echoing down the hallway, and a dark look passed over his face.\nLord Vetas had killed SouSmith’s nephew, and SouSmith wasn’t ever going\nto let that go. Adamat realized suddenly that bringing the big boxer here\nmay not have been the best idea.\nOf course, if he put Claremonte’s head through a wall, it would\ncertainly make life a lot easier for everyone.\n“There’s just something…” Adamat trailed off as they returned to the"

Claremonte’s manservant eyed him and SouSmith\nsuspiciously, but didn’t ask where they had been.\n“Ah, there you are,” Hewi said. “We were just leaving, Inspector.” She\nmade an impatient gesture toward the door with her hat.\n“Pardon me, Commissioner,” Claremonte said, “but could I speak with\nAdamat alone?”\nHewi gave a nod and stepped outside. Adamat felt his heart suddenly\nbeat a little faster. Alone? With Claremonte? The temptation to brain him\nover the head with his cane might prove too much. He nodded to SouSmith,\nand a moment later he was alone with Lord Claremonte.\n“Inspector,” Claremonte said. “I hope that any past unpleasantness that\nyou may think occurred between us can remain in the past.”\nAdamat bit his tongue. Your man kidnapped my wife and family!\nAbused them in unspeakable ways, and caused the death of my son! I’ll see\nyou dead. “As you say,” he said, remembering one of the phrases he used to\nuse when caught in an awkward conversation with a nobleman.\n“Don’t waste your time with me, Inspector. I didn’t try to kill Mr.\nTumblar. I don’t know who did. I would offer my help with the\ninvestigation, but I don’t think you’d accept it.”\n“We’ll see,” Adamat said, matching Claremonte’s condescending tone.\n“Thank you for the advice.”\nClaremonte quickly rose from his seat and crossed the room to stand\nbeside Adamat. The sun shone just behind him, surrounding Claremonte\nwith a glowing halo and forcing Adamat to look away. “If I wanted Mr.\nTumblar dead, Adamat,” Claremonte said, his voice barely above a whisper,\n“then he’d be dead.”\n“Or else your men cocked up the job.”\nClaremonte snorted. “Indeed. You’re a very suspicious man, Inspector.\nBe sure it doesn’t put you in an early grave.” Claremonte turned away, his\nback to Adamat, and Adamat was sorely tempted to take a swing at him.\nOne well-placed strike with his cane could paralyze the man – Adamat was\nsure he’d then be able to strangle him before anyone returned to the room.\nInstead, he tried to come up with some witty retort. When none was\nforthcoming, he joined Hewi, SouSmith, and Hewi’s officers in the\nservants’ halls.\n“What did he want?” Hewi asked.\n“Nothing important,” Adamat murmured.\nThey were led back out through the maze of corridors and servants’\ndoors to the side of the palace and Adamat got inside his carriage. It rocked\nheavily when SouSmith climbed in beside him. Adamat rapped on the\nceiling with his cane, but the carriage didn’t move.\n“Inspector,” Hewi said, coming to the window. “You should steer clear\nof Claremonte.”\nI should. But I won’t. “I have work to do, Commissioner. With all due\nrespect.”"

She glanced at\nSouSmith, then gestured for Adamat to step outside. He followed her a\ndozen paces from the carriage. “One of the officers I had with me is a\nKnacked,” she said in a low voice. “We keep it quiet, because he’s very\nhard to see in the Else if you have the third eye.”\n“What is his Knack?” Adamat asked.\n“Swear to keep this quiet?”\nAdamat nodded.\n“He can hear lies. He knows when a man is telling the truth or a fib.\nIt’s one of our secret weapons, and if it ever got out, the Proprietor would\ndoubtless have him killed.”\nAdamat whistled. “With good reason.” He’d heard of Knackeds like\nthat. One of the most valuable Knacks in the world, and very rare. Adamat\nwanted to ask what the man was doing working for a police force in\nAdopest when he could be some king’s truthsayer and living like, well, a\nking. But that would have to wait.\n“And you’re saying that Claremonte didn’t lie?”\n“Not a word of it. Fudged a little bit when he said we could have\naccess to all his employees, but that’s no surprise. A man like that has\nsecrets. But he didn’t order Ricard killed.”\nAdamat bid farewell to the commissioner and returned to his carriage,\ndropping into his seat with a sigh.\n“Somethin’ important?” SouSmith asked.\n“Claremonte isn’t our man.”\n“Hmm.”\n“My thought exactly. I don’t even bloody well know where to start if\nit’s not Claremonte.” The carriage was soon rolling, and Adamat slowly\nwent through the list of Ricard’s known enemies in his head. “We’ll have to\ngo see Ricard. I have to find out if Claremonte has as good a chance at\nwinning as he seems to think. Maybe we’ll have a…” Adamat trailed off, a\nthought entering his mind.\n“What?”\n“We need to go to the library, too. It’ll have to wait until tomorrow,\nbut… Pit!”\nSouSmith cocked an eyebrow at him. “Yeah?”\n“I just figured out what was bothering me so much about that room.\nClaremonte was sitting in the window, with the morning sun at his back.”\n“And?”\n“And he didn’t cast a shadow.”\nCHAPTER 28\n“F\nield Marshal Tamas!”\nThe voice echoed up the line and made Tamas’s shoulders tighten with\nrecognition. He could hear the approaching rhythm of hoofbeats and the\noccasional curse of the infantrymen as a man rode up the lines too closely.\nA glance beside him showed Olem turned in his saddle – not, as some\nmight think, to look toward the rider, but to see which soldiers he’d show\nthe back of his hand later that night."

The third in line for the Kez throne looked\nwell. His wounds had healed nicely, thanks to the Deliv Privileged, and his\ncheeks were fuller now from weeks of inaction and enjoying Sulem’s\nhospitality. “I must speak with you.”\n“It appears you already are,” Tamas commented. The wound in his\nside still itched despite Sulem’s healers and he imagined he could still feel\nthe sharp pain deep in his flesh, though whether that was real or was due to\nthe sting of an old friend’s betrayal, he did not know.\nBeon had a boyish face despite being in his late twenties – the effects\nof cabal sorcery meant to keep the royal family looking young – and Tamas\nthought that the pale scars from the Battle at Kresimir’s Fingers helped\nmake him look more serious. He removed his hat and mopped at his\nforehead. “In private, if possible.”\nTamas exchanged a look with Olem. The bodyguard gave a slight\nsmirk.\n“There’s not a lot of privacy on the march, Sir Prince,” Tamas said.\n“This is a serious matter,” Beon insisted. “I have…” – he checked\nhimself, glancing toward the nearby marching infantry, and lowered his\nvoice – “I have learned that you sent away my father’s messengers. Without\neven hearing them!”\n“Someone’s tongue has been wagging, Olem.”\n“I’ll see to it, sir,” Olem said gravely.\nBeon stiffened. “I don’t make use of spies, but I do have ears, sir! Your\nmen talk to each other loudly and I need only but listen to find out what’s\ngoing on in the camp.”\n“You disapprove? I find letting my men gossip is easier and more\nbeneficial than the Kez way – silence enforced by fear. Keeps up the\nmorale.”\n“You evade my meaning.”\n“The messengers? It’s true. I have nothing to say to them and nothing\nto hear from them. You know what your father did.”\n“But did he do it?” Beon demanded. “Can you be certain?”\n“I have the bodies of thirty-seven grenadiers in Kez uniforms, carrying\nKez muskets, bayonets, swords, and powder. They have Kez coins in their\npurses and they wear boots made in the south of Kez. That’s fairly damning\nevidence.”\n“I would agree, sir, but…”\n“But what?” Tamas felt his ire returning. He respected Beon. He even\nliked him, as much as he could like a member of the Kez royal family. He\nwas a talented cuirassier and had a sharp mind. Tamas had not thought him\nso naïve.\nBeon plowed on before Tamas could continue. “But I don’t think my\nfather would have done this. Why did they go west instead of south?

If they\nwere my father’s men, they would have bolted straight for the Kez lines\nafter such a daring attack.”\n“They went west because they hit the rear of the camp and it was\neasier and faster to take the western road and skirt brigades than it would\nhave been to fight through them. And you don’t think he would have done\nthis? Your father, who authorized the sacking of Alvation in order to turn\nDeliv against Adro? Your father, who by your own admission is just as\nlikely to have you executed for your failure to stop me as he is to welcome\nyou, his son, back from a harrowing campaign?” Tamas shook his head.\n“Explain it to me. And use small words, for I fear I’m not as nimble-minded\nas you on this matter.”\nBeon scowled at Tamas, and Tamas was reminded of Ipille’s famous\ntemper. Would Beon reach over and strike him for that? And would Olem\nshoot him the moment he did? Part of him wanted to find out. But this\nwasn’t the time. “This isn’t Kez,” Tamas said softly. “And you decided to\nmarch with me instead of with the Deliv. You will be accorded respect, but\nyour royalty means little here, son of Ipille.”\n“Not even my father would break a flag of truce,” Beon said after a\nmoment, chewing on his words as if he hoped to convince himself of their\ntruth.\n“I think he would. I know he did. You can go see the bodies of those\ngrenadiers yourself, if you like. They’re in some wagons back near the rear\nof the column. I intend on flinging them at your father’s feet before I fling\nhim in a dungeon and ransom him back to Kez for all the krana in your\ndamned country.”\nBeon drew himself up, fingers tightening on the hilt of a cavalry saber\nthat wasn’t there. “You go too far.”\n“Sir,” Olem said quietly. Tamas tore his gaze away from Beon long\nenough to look at his bodyguard. Olem held his cigarette to his lips with\none hand, gazing over his fingertips calmly at Tamas.\nTamas felt his anger slip. “Perhaps you’re right,” he said to Beon.\n“Then see his messengers!” Beon said. “You can avoid more\nbloodshed.”\n“No, no. You’re not right about your father. You’re right that I went\ntoo far and I apologize for that. Your father attacked us under a flag of truce\n– likely unaware that the Deliv were as close as they were. He will pay for\nthat crime, though I suspect it is his people who will pay the price and not\nhe himself. Further bloodshed is unavoidable.”\nThere was something that bothered Tamas. Ipille must have known that\nthe Deliv forces were on their way. He must know that Deliv had already\ninvaded Kez from the northwest. Why would he dare such a raid against the\nAdran camp?\nEach time he pondered it, he came to the same conclusion: Ipille had\nsomehow learned of Ka-poel and her power over Kresimir and had gambled\neverything on her capture.

Perhaps even now he was learning how to bring\nKresimir out of his slumber so that the god could destroy everything in his\npath. Had Ipille grown so desperate? The stories Taniel had told Tamas\nabout the night he stole Kresimir’s bloody bedsheets had made Tamas’s\nskin crawl. How could even Ipille want anything to do with such a creature\nas this mad god?\nTamas wondered briefly if the Deliv royal cabal would be able to put\nup any kind of fight in the face of such power.\nThis wasn’t information Tamas was about to relay to Beon. Instead, he\nsaid, “Your father’s messengers are a delaying tactic. He will try to put me\noff as long as possible while he brings up fresh troops from Kez. I will not\nallow that to happen.”\nBeon relented and stared at his saddle horn in contemplation. Tamas\nwelcomed the silence, hoping that Beon would remain that way, and\nwondered how Taniel had reacted to his sending Vlora and Gavril to help. It\nhad been a difficult decision – one that might drive Taniel to distraction, but\nTamas hoped that Taniel’s drive to save his savage lover would force him to\nwork with Vlora. There was no deadlier pair in the powder cabal than those\ntwo, save Taniel and Tamas himself.\nMaybe Gavril could keep their heads level.\nOlem drew Tamas’s attention to a messenger galloping down the lines.\nShe wore the blue-and-silver uniform of an Adran dragoon. The woman\nwas covered in sweat and dust, and Tamas noted blood on her silver collar.\nShe reined in ahead of him and saluted.\n“Corporal Salli reporting, sir, of the Seventy-Ninth Dragoons. Sir, a\nmoment to catch my breath, sir!”\n“Granted,” Tamas said, exchanging a glance with Olem. The Seventy-\nNinth were supposed to be scouting the western plains. Had the Kez\nPrivileged from the other night tried to cut across the plains and run into his\ndragoons? “General Beon, if you would excuse me.” Tamas waited until the\nKez prince had fallen back out of earshot, then said, “Are you wounded,\nsoldier?”\nA quizzical look crossed her face, then she touched her collar. “Oh,\nthis? Not my blood, sir. Belongs to some Kez cuirassier.”\nOlem brought his mount up next to hers and offered his canteen, which\nshe took gratefully, draining half in one go and splashing a little on her face\nand neck before handing it back. “Thank you, sir.”\n“Your report?” Olem asked.\n“We were attacked a little north of Gillsfellow by Kez cuirassiers. We\noutnumbered them two to one, but they managed to surprise us, and took\ntheir toll before we were able to recover and win the day.”\n“How many did you lose?” Tamas asked.\n“A hundred and twenty-seven dead, three hundred and twelve\nwounded. We killed one hundred and seventy-one of the enemy and\ncaptured twice that many, most of whom are wounded.”\n“Could be worse, I suppose.”"

Colonel Davis was a capable cavalry commander, if a\nlittle shortsighted at times. “Gillsfellow is north of us. Damn it, how did\nthey get behind us? And what the pit are they doing so far north?”\nCorporal Salli shook her head. “Not sure, sir. I passed two companies\nof our dragoons on my way to give a report. The Thirty-Sixth has been\nbadly mauled, and their major has lost all his messengers. Gave me a report\nfor you.” She handed the report to Olem. “I also spotted more Kez in the\ndistance, about eight miles northwest of here. Looked like dragoons, at least\na regiment of them.”\nTamas took the report and glanced over it before handing it to Olem.\n“Get some rest, Corporal. I’ll have orders ready for the Seventy-Ninth in a\nquarter of an hour.”\nThe messenger saluted and rode on down the line. Tamas swore again\nunder his breath. “I can’t afford to lose any more senior officers. Find out if\nthere’s anyone worth promoting among the Seventy-Ninth. If not, find a\nreplacement from that list I gave you earlier.”\n“Yes sir,” Olem said.\n“Also, send messengers to our dragoon regiments. Let them know that\nIpille is trying to win superiority of the plains. He must have sent all his\nremaining cavalry north the day after the parley. They should keep their\neyes out for traps. He’s trying to distract us and I won’t let that happen.\nSend a messenger to Sulem and see if he can spare a couple thousand\ndragoons to reinforce our own.” Tamas tried to make sense of everything in\nhis head. The battle would have taken place not far south of where Taniel\nwas chasing those Kez Privileged. Perhaps the Kez cavalry were screening\nfor the retreating grenadiers.\n“Our cuirassiers, sir?”\n“They’re too slow out in the open. I’m keeping them in reserve for\nwhen we meet the Kez lines. If Ipille wastes all his cavalry in a bid for the\nplains, he’ll have nothing to counter ours when it comes to the real battle.”\n“But they’ll be behind us, sir.”\n“And cut off from communication with the main army. A fact we can\nuse to our advantage. See if Sulem has any riding Privileged.”\n“Oh, that’ll be a nasty surprise for Ipille’s cavalry. Excellent thinking,\nsir.”\n“Looks like another one coming in, sir.” Olem nodded up the line to\nwhere a horseman had just crested a hilltop and was coming down toward\nthem along the road.\n“Shit. What is it this time?”\nThe messenger was one of Tamas’s own – a ranger from the vanguard.\n“Sir,” he said before he’d come to a stop.\n“Tell me we’re getting close to the enemy camp.”\nThe messenger grimaced. “We are, sir.

He dismissed the\nmessenger and sat brooding in his saddle.\n“Sir? Isn’t that a good thing?” Olem asked.\n“No,” Tamas said. “It’s as I suspected: Ipille is pulling back, resorting\nto delaying actions. He just needs to keep us off of him long enough to\nawaken Kresimir, and then he’ll kill us all.”\n“What do we do, sir?”\n“We press on, and hope Taniel catches up to his savage Bone-eye in\ntime.”\n“And if he doesn’t?”\n“Then we’re all dead men anyway, and I intend on taking Ipille with\nme when we go.”\nCHAPTER 29\n“W\nhy didn’t you tell me?” Taniel asked.\nHe rode alongside Gavril on the western road, trying desperately not to\nthink about Vlora. She still loved him, Gavril had claimed, and she had not\ndenied it. The revelation had been a shock – something that Taniel hadn’t\neven considered. She’d bedded another man, hadn’t she? That meant that\nshe no longer wanted him, didn’t it? Feelings he’d spent the last six months\ntrying to bury were suddenly bubbling to the surface. Until last night the\nwhole situation had been cut-and-dried. He’d dealt with it and moved on,\nonly to find that he’d never had the facts straight in the first place.\nIt was confusing and it made him want to shoot something.\nThe big man beside him sat slumped, looking half-asleep and almost\nready to fall out of his saddle. It was a misleading posture. He was watching\nthe road, and he read the wear of hooves in the mud like a scholar might\nread a long-dead language.\n“Eh?” he rumbled. “Oh, you mean back on South Pike?”\n“Yes.”\n“I was drunk.”\n“You sobered up pretty quick.”\n“Well, that’s the odd thing. I kinda assumed you knew.”\nTaniel peered more closely at the big Watchmaster. “What?”\n“It didn’t actually occur to me that Tamas wouldn’t tell you that I was\nyour uncle. Not for a while, anyway, and when it did, there wasn’t a good\ntime to tell you. We were in the middle of a rather violent siege, after all.\nAnd I thought he probably had a reason for not telling you that the South\nPike Mountainwatch drunkard was your uncle.”\nTaniel couldn’t help but feel some indignation at that. “So you weren’t\ngoing to actually tell me? I’ve thought – for years – that Tamas was the only\nclose family I had left.”\n“Really?” Gavril straightened in his saddle. “You know, every time I\nthink I’ve come to terms with the shit your father does, I find out about\nsomething like this. He didn’t even mention me?”\n“I have vague memories,” Taniel said. “Of being told about my uncles.\nNothing more. No names.”"

No names.”\nGavril grunted and tugged gently on his reins. “I’ve been a fairly\nreprehensible drunk since your mother died. Maybe Tamas didn’t want me\nto meet you. Or maybe the memories of another family were too much for\nhim.” He snorted to show what he thought of that.\n“Too much? I don’t think the man has emotions.”\n“You’d be surprised. Your other uncle was Camenir, my little brother.\nHe was just a boy, not much older than you when we went after Ipille. He’s\nburied in Kez.” Gavril held up his hand for a halt and pointed at the ground.\n“Riders. Around sixty came through here yesterday. They rested here. If\nmemory serves, we’re getting pretty close to the Counter’s Road, the north-\nsouth highway. We’ll want to slow our pace, prepare for anything. If there’s\ngoing to be another ambush, it’ll be soon.”\nTaniel stowed the questions he wanted to ask Gavril in the back of his\nmind and tried to ignore the surge of confused emotion caused by the sight\nof Vlora coming back down the road toward them. She had been on\nscouting duty with one of the Riflejacks. He could tell by the urgency with\nwhich she leaned forward in the saddle that she had found something.\n“We’re about a half mile from the intersection,” she said as she\nreached them. “And the grenadiers have laid a trap.”\n“How do you know?” Gavril asked the question before Taniel could.\n“They’re waiting about a little under two miles to the south, flanking\nthe road. I got just close enough to sense the powder and get a feel for their\npositioning and came back.”\nTaniel asked, “Any Privileged?”\n“None that I could see with my third eye.”\n“Perfect. Their Privileged must have left them behind to deal with us.\nWe have the advantage because we know their positioning. We can turn\ntheir trap back on them.”\n“Better than that,” Vlora said. “I can just detonate all their powder.\nTake out the whole lot in one go. Few enough powder mages can do it at a\ndistance.”\n“Few enough? There’s just you.”\nVlora gave him a grin. “So they won’t be expecting it.”\n“They might have Ka-poel.”\n“Not if the Privileged aren’t there,” Gavril said. “They’ll have taken\nher on ahead if they know what she’s carrying.”\nOf course. They would keep her close as they fled. But… but what if\nthey didn’t? Vlora could detonate all their powder, killing her right along\nwith the grenadiers. “I can’t risk it.”\n“Can she be seen in the Else?” Vlora asked.\n“She has the glow. It’s hard to tell, for most.”\n“But you can tell?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then come with me. The two of us can get close enough, make sure\nshe’s not there. You can put a bullet through any Privileged they may have\nand I’ll detonate the powder. Our Riflejacks can stay back half a mile and\ncome in to mop everything up.”"

Our Riflejacks can stay back half a mile and\ncome in to mop everything up.”\nTaniel checked his pistols to be sure they were loaded. “That’ll work.”\nThey continued on until they reached the T-intersection, where their\nhighway ended in the Counter’s Road. Vlora stayed out front with the\nscouts, and Taniel hung back with Gavril. He wanted to ask the big\nWatchmaster about his mother, but his mouth didn’t seem to want to form\nthe words. Vlora was still in love with him, his own lover was still held\ncaptive by the Kez, and they were about to ride straight into half a company\nof grenadiers.\n“Taniel,” Gavril said, bringing him back to the present. “Bad news.”\n“What is it?”\n“Someone’s ridden north, here at the intersection.”\n“What do you mean?”\nGavril dismounted and spent a few moments examining the ground of\nthe intersection, mumbling quietly to himself. “Eight, maybe ten split off\nfrom the main group. They’re heading north. Everyone else went south.”\n“Can you be sure?” Taniel asked, feeling a sudden fear. What if the\nKez had planned a second ambush? Taniel’s company would turn south\nalong the road and try to spring the first trap while a second group of them\ncame down from behind. He reached out with his senses, pushing them to\ntheir limit to try to feel something else out there – Ka-poel, a Privileged,\npowder. There was nothing.\n“Not completely, no,” Gavril said. “It could be travelers. It could be\nAdran patrols, unaware that the Kez are even in this part of Adro. Pit, it\ncould be Mountainwatchers, down from the peaks to cut wood or get\nsupplies.”\nOf course they weren’t going north. That would be preposterous. There\nwas nothing to the north but Adro for hundreds of miles. They could try the\nhigh passes for Deliv, but the Deliv were on the warpath after Alvation. No\nKez would make it through their lands alive.\n“Norrine,” Taniel said.\nThe powder mage drew her horse over to Taniel and saluted. “Sir?”\n“You’re the best rider of this bunch and you’ve got sharp eyes. Go\nwith Gavril. The two of you move north and try to sniff out a Kez trap.\nVlora and I will go south and slaughter the grenadiers. It’ll be up to you two\nto tell us if the Kez have come in behind us. Flerrier, Doll, and the\nRiflejacks will take the road and be ready to guard our rear.”\n“Yes sir.”\nGavril gave a slow nod. “It’s risky, splitting like this. But it’s the best\nway to keep them from getting the drop on us.”\n“Get to it, then.” Taniel looked around the gathered soldiers and\nmages. “We have Kez to kill.”\nTaniel dismounted and handed his reins to one of the Riflejacks, then\ncollected his pistols, rifle, and sword.

It would allow them to avoid any trickery on the part of the Kez and\nto sneak up on the grenadiers from the side – they wouldn’t expect mages in\nhot pursuit to slow down long enough for this.\nNot that it was slowing them too much. He and Vlora could move\nthrough the trees more quietly than most, and they both burned powder\ntrances, which made them move and think faster. Taniel could hear every\ncrack of twigs and creak of trees in the forest for two hundred paces. It was\na cacophony of information, but part of his training as a mage had been to\nfilter that information into what were the animal noises of the forest and\nwhat was the movement of men.\nTaniel found himself relieved that their mission required silence and\nthe clear focus of moving quietly in the woods. He couldn’t afford to let\nVlora distract him now. He was able to push those thoughts to the back of\nhis mind, where they haunted him like a half-seen shadow.\nHe knew they would be back.\nHe let Vlora take point. Less than half an hour later she raised a fist,\nsignaling a halt, and crouched down into the underbrush. Taniel crept to her\nside.\n“We’re about a half mile out,” she said.\n“Very close.”\n“That’s about the farthest I dare try the detonation, and I have a clear\nsense of them all. They’re flanking the road from high vantage points.” She\ntouched her temple and was silent for a moment, her eyes looking\nunfocused. “I’d guess as many as sixty of them.”\n“Sounds right,” Taniel said. “Any Privileged?”\n“No. I don’t sense your savage girl, either. You’d better check for her.”\nTaniel took a sniff of powder, trying to ignore the way Vlora had said\n“your savage girl” and the accusation in her tone. He opened his third eye,\nsteadying himself with one hand on the rough bark of a tree, and studied the\nKez trap.\nHe focused on the area where he could sense the black powder and\nsquinted into the trees, looking for the familiar dim glow of pastel color in\nthe Else that indicated Ka-poel’s presence. The strength of her glow was\nsomewhere between a Knacked and a Privileged, but several shades darker\nin color, which made her more difficult to see.\nSeveral minutes passed before he let his third eye drop. He put his\nforehead against the back of his hand for a moment, fighting down his\nnausea. When he’d recovered, he said, “No sign of her. Does it seem odd to\nyou that they have no Knacked?”\n“Now that you mention it…” Vlora’s eyes were fixed on the Kez\nposition. “Maybe they had one or two and they were killed in the attack on\nour camp.”\nTaniel brushed off the niggling doubt he felt in the back of his head.\n“Probably right.

    "text": "“Probably right. Are you ready?”\n“Yes.” Vlora moved several feet forward to crouch behind a fallen tree.\nPutting her back to the hollow trunk, she set her rifle across her knees and\nclosed her eyes. Taniel saw a smile touch her lips and then felt her reaching\nout with her senses.\nHe felt the series of explosions rippling through his mage senses. A\nmoment later and he heard angry bangs going off like a fusillade on a\nbattlefield.\n“Go,” Vlora said.\nTaniel hopped the fallen tree and was sprinting through the forest, rifle\nheld at the ready, eyes sharp for the green-and-tan uniforms of the Kez\ngrenadiers. He heard Vlora fall in behind and to his right. Dry leaves\ncrunched under his feet and branches whipped his arms and face. This\nwasn’t about stealth now but about catching any survivors before they could\nrecover.\nThey would be confused and disoriented from the explosions – more\nthan likely wounded – and thinking that a whole brigade of Adran troops\nwere about to fall on them. Taniel had to reach their position quickly and\ntake them captive or kill them before they realized they were only facing\ntwo powder mages.\nHe reached the top of a hill and paused to get his bearings. “Where?”\nhe gasped.\n“Next rise!” Vlora didn’t pause, racing past him and taking point. She\nhad already fixed her bayonet. Taniel cursed and fixed his own as he chased\nafter her.\nHe skidded to a stop near the top of the next rise and ducked behind a\ntree. He could see Vlora up ahead. She had slung her rifle over her shoulder\nand drawn a pistol. Slowly, she stood up.\nTaniel waited for her signal to move forward and strained for the\nsounds of the wounded and dying. Nothing. Even with his powder-\nenhanced senses the forest was utterly still. No birds, no animals. Had\nVlora’s powder ignition killed every single one of the grenadiers outright?\nThat didn’t seem possible.\nThe moments stretched on while Vlora stood silently, and Taniel\nfinally lost all patience. He dashed to her side, rifle ready.\nThe scene on the hillside below them stopped him dead in his tracks.\nHe could see the road from this vantage, and the evidence of powder\ndetonations all along this hill and the hillside on the opposite side of the\nroad. Black stains marked the trees, leaves smoldered, fallen branches\nburned, and the scent of the spent powder hung in the air like a fog. The\nground was pockmarked with small craters.\nBut the only victims were the trees themselves and a couple of\nunfortunate squirrels.\nTaniel lifted his rifle further and spun around. His eyes scanned the\nsurrounding forest, looking for a trap within a trap. Not a creature stirred.\n“I don’t understand,” Vlora said. “Is this some kind of distraction?\nSomething to slow us down?”\nA nearby motion caught Taniel’s eye. Upon closer examination he\nfound it to be the leather strap of a powder horn, the ends burned off, but\nthe leather itself surprisingly unharmed. It swung from a branch gently, as if\nmocking them. Taniel felt his heart thundering in his chest as he tried to\ndiscover not how they’d been tricked, but why."

Taniel felt his heart thundering in his chest as he tried to\ndiscover not how they’d been tricked, but why.\n“Do you hear something?” Vlora asked.\nTaniel cocked his head to the wind and waited for the sound to reach\nhis ears. It didn’t take long.\n“Screams,” Taniel said. He was already running for the road as he said\nit. The screams were coming from the north. From the Riflejacks they’d left\nbehind.\nThis wasn’t the entire trap.\nTaniel raced down the hard-packed dirt tracks of the western highway.\nHe could hear Vlora’s pounding feet behind him as he tore a powder\ncharge from his belt pouch and stuffed it in his mouth, feeling the grit of the\nblack powder in his gums. In his haste he dropped several charges, but he\ndidn’t have time to stop for them.\nThe trick was so simple. So obvious. They knew that Tamas would\nsend powder mages after them. The mage would sense the trap, approach\nwith caution, and then be ambushed from the rear. Or, in this case, he’d be\nseparated from his men entirely. He had fallen for it without hesitation!\nIt took him and Vlora less than two minutes to cross the mile between\nthe false ambush and where their men waited on the road, but even that was\ntoo late.\nHe took in the scene as he rounded a bend: Sixty or more Kez\ngrenadiers, armed with pikes and heavy sabers, their kits stripped of black\npowder, had fallen upon the Riflejacks. Bodies of men and horses littered\nthe road and surrounding woods, and though less than fifteen Kez\ngrenadiers remained on their feet, the Riflejacks, along with Doll and\nFlerrier, had been slaughtered.\nTaniel put on a burst of speed, ready to close with the surviving Kez,\nbut he felt a pair of hands on his side and he was thrown from the road and\ninto a dry streambed.\nHe landed with an oof and Vlora on top of him.\n“What…?” he started.\n“Shh.”\nHe fell silent for long enough for her to poke her head from the\nstreambed. “What the pit was that?” he hissed.\n“Our men are down,” she said. “No sense in rushing in like fools.”\nTaniel collected his hat. “Within minutes they’re going to figure out\nthat there were more than two powder mages in the group and come looking\nfor us.”\n“Give me a moment, I’m thinking.”\nTaniel gripped his rifle. “We don’t have a moment. Gavril and Norrine,\nremember? They’ll have heard the screams as well as us.”\n“Shit.”\nTaniel slapped her on the shoulder. “Go on. Back across the road. Take\nthat hill over there and hit them on my signal.”\n“All right.” Vlora retreated along the streambed, back to the bend in\nthe road, before crossing over. Taniel gave her thirty seconds and then made\noff at a crouching run.\nHe circled behind a knoll some forty paces from the road.

They had hid behind this very knoll, waiting for the Riflejacks\nto cross their path, then descended upon them – probably from both sides,\nconsidering their lack of muskets. They needn’t have worried about cross\nfire.\nHe reached the top of the knoll and hunkered down beside a tree with a\nclear view of the road. The grenadiers had rounded up three bloody,\nwounded Riflejacks and were questioning them aggressively, while their\ncomrades tended to their own wounded.\nTaniel loaded his rifle with two bullets and looked for the stripes of the\ngrenadier commander, a captain. It was the man doing the questioning, and\nas Taniel watched, he leaned over and casually slit the throat of one of the\nRiflejacks.\nTaniel’s bullets caught the grenadier captain in the right temple, and a\nsergeant, likely his second-in-command, in the stomach. Before Taniel\ncould load more bullets, the grenadiers sprang into action. They readied\ntheir pikes and kicked rifles and powder horns away from them. These men\nwere trained for fighting powder mages.\nOne ill-timed kick lost a grenadier his leg as the powder detonated.\nTaniel grinned, reloading his rifle as the Kez scrambled for cover. His next\ndouble-shot hit only one of his targets, taking the woman down with a gut\nshot. He heard one of the grenadiers shout in a language that was most\ndefinitely not Kez.\nWas that Brudanian? Why would Kez soldiers be shouting in\nBrudanian? Taniel didn’t have time to think about it. Ten big Kez soldiers\nleapt from their cover and rushed Taniel’s knoll. None noticed as one of\ntheir number was gunned down from behind.\nTaniel didn’t have time to finish loading another shot. He leapt to his\nfeet, throwing another powder charge into his mouth and blocking the thrust\nof a pike with his rifle barrel. He was forced back, unable to counterattack\ndue to the closeness of the trees, and helpless to do anything but watch the\ngrenadiers flank him.\nHe let go of his rifle and leapt to the side as the soldier’s momentum\ncarried him forward. Taniel drew his belt knife and rammed it between the\ngrenadier’s ribs, thrusting the man aside and taking his pike, whirling to\nblock the thrust of a saber.\nHe dispatched two more, taking a heavy cut above his brow that\npoured blood into his eye before Vlora joined the fight. She whirled through\nthe remaining grenadiers with her short sword and a powder trance, giving\nher a huge advantage in speed in the close quarters, cutting down every\nremaining man in moments. By the time Taniel had wiped the blood from\nhis face, the fight was over.\nWinded and half-blinded, Taniel turned toward the sound of hoofbeats\npounding up the road. He snatched up his rifle and loaded it, ready for the\nworst.\nGavril’s and Norrine’s horses stopped short of the slaughter, refusing\nto go any farther. Taniel could hear Gavril’s curses from the woods."

Taniel could hear Gavril’s curses from the woods.\n“Taniel!” Gavril yelled.\n“Here,” he called back, already jogging toward the road.\n“It was a damned trick,” Taniel said. “The powder was set a mile down\nthe road, laid out like men lying in wait, and the grenadiers hiding here in\nthe woods.”\nGavril swung from his horse while Vlora ran to free the two surviving\nRiflejacks.\n“Sorry, sir,” one of the Riflejacks said to Taniel, wincing as Vlora\nhelped him to his feet. “Came out of the woods like ghosts. Flerrier and\nDoll fought like the pit, but we were overwhelmed after our first volley. The\npikes did in our horses without trouble.”\nGavril put down one of the frightened, thrashing horses with his pistol,\nwhile Norrine gave Taniel stitches on his brow. “Gather their survivors,”\nTaniel ordered. “I want to find out what the pit they know.” His head spun\nand he was still trying to make sense of it all. The trap had been perfect, and\nhe’d walked right into it. It made him furious to see those Adran soldiers –\nhis soldiers – lying dead in the road. There was no one to blame but\nhimself.\nThere were twenty-three surviving grenadiers, and Taniel could tell at\na glance that most of them would be dead of their wounds by morning. His\nown two surviving Riflejacks might survive if they could avoid infection,\nhaving gotten off with a dozen light wounds between the two of them. The\nRiflejacks’ horses – and Taniel’s and Vlora’s – were either dead or had\nthrown their riders and fled.\nTaniel climbed to his feet after Norrine finished his stitches. He’d had\ntime to catch his breath and let the pain and anger simmer. He had to come\nup with a plan now. They’d lost valuable time, and they’d lost their\nadvantage of five powder mages.\nNorrine knelt beside one of the Kez grenadiers, removing her own\nneedle and silk thread.\n“No, don’t,” Taniel said. “They’re not getting any help until they tell\nus what the game is.” He walked up and down the line of grenadiers, now\nstripped of their jackets and with their hands tied behind their backs with\ntheir own belts. Gavril stood over them, arms crossed, teeth set. He did not\nlook like a man to cross right then.\n“How about it?” Taniel asked. “First man who tells me how many men\nyour Privileged master has left will be the first man to get medical\ntreatment.”\nSome of the soldiers stared at their feet. Others stared at him dumbly.\nA few of them moaned from the pain and one was weeping and holding his\nbloody side.\nTaniel repeated his offer in Kez. The soldiers glanced at each other but\ndid not answer. “Any of you speak Brudanian? I don’t know more than a\nfew words.”\n“I do.” Gavril said, then rattled off a few sentences. The men seemed\nto perk up at this, and one of them answered. Gavril switched to Adran. “He"

Gavril switched to Adran. “He\nsays it’s just three Privileged, six grenadiers, and the savage.”\n“Why the pit would they be speaking Brudanian?” Taniel asked,\nthough he already knew the answer.\n“Because they’re Brudanian,” Vlora said. “Like the army that’s\nholding Adopest right now.”\nGavril said, “Norrine and I followed fresh tracks, nine sets, north. We\nonly turned back when we heard the fighting. They’re taking your girl to\nAdopest.”\n“Bastards have pulled one over on our whole damn army,” Taniel said.\n“Tamas is fighting the wrong war.”\nCHAPTER 30\nN\nila worked her way through the Adran and then the Deliv camps, slowly\ngathering her courage to approach the Deliv cabal.\nShe had not expected them to arrive so soon. Tamas had insisted she\nstay close in case he needed her magic – whatever good it could do him,\nconsidering she still couldn’t consistently pull sorcery from the Else – and\nhadn’t let her accompany Bo to the Privileged healers. He’d said Bo could\nbe gone for too long to risk losing both of his Privileged for a possible fight.\nBut just two days later the Kez cabal had arrived. Had it been some\nkind of a trick to separate her and Bo? Or just a miscommunication?\nPerhaps she was just being overly cautious.\nBo would be proud.\nShe threaded her way through Deliv soldiers, who watched her closely\nbut kept their distance. She wore a blue dress too fine for a laundress but\nnot fashionable enough for a lady, and she had done her hair in a borrowed\nmirror. She was just wondering why no one had asked for her credentials,\nwhen a dark-skinned Deliv slid up beside her.\nShe recognized the stripes of a captain on his lapels. He was a\nhandsome man, quite tall with slender shoulders. He grinned at her. “Going\nsomewhere, my lady?”\n“Yes, thank you.” She could feel his hand hovering just behind the\nsmall of her back.\n“Can I help you find where you’re going?” His hand brushed her ass\ngently. She turned toward him, a welcoming smile on her face, and punched\nhim in the nose.\nHe reeled back with a high-pitched squeal, fumbling at his face. “Aii!\nPit, woman!” Surprise turned to anger, which quickly progressed to fury. He\nwiped his nose with one sleeve, looking down at the trickle of blood on his\ncuff, then reached for his belt. “You made a mistake, lass.”\nNila realized that mistake just after her knuckles connected with his\nnose. She was in a foreign camp – she had no companion or chaperone, and\nshe didn’t know the least thing about Deliv social mores. What’s more, this\nman had the stripes of a captain on his lapel.

Nothing to do now but\nfollow through. “I’ll teach you a lesson, you ingrate. I’m looking for the\nDeliv cabal. If you touch me again, I’ll put that hand so far up your ass,\nyou’ll be able to scratch your own nose.”\nThe Deliv captain retreated several feet. He visually searched her up\nand down, glancing repeatedly at her bare hands, looking for evidence that\nshe was a Privileged. She could see his mind working for several moments,\nas if he was weighing his odds. Finally, he said in a nasally tone, “They’re\nsequestered just to the east.”\n“Thank you.”\nShe turned her back on him though every instinct told her not to, and\nbegan heading in the indicated direction. This was another part to play, she\nreminded herself. No more dangerous than the parts she played for Lord\nVetas. She was a lady, a Privileged, and she had to demand respect.\n“Watch yourself, lass,” the Deliv’s voice called to her.\nShe wanted to make a rude gesture, but she thought perhaps that was\nbeneath the dignity of a Privileged.\nThe Deliv cabal, it turned out, was not hard to spot. Immense tents of\nwhite and Kelly-green rose just beyond the next rise. While not as high as\nthe tent belonging to the Deliv king, these were far wider and more\nnumerous, with dozens of chambers seemingly interconnected by cloaked\navenues to keep the Privileged’s comings and goings shielded from\ncommon eyes. The whole area was cordoned off from the rest of the camp\nby a fine green ribbon tied at intervals to tall wooden posts. Each post was\ncovered in Deliv script and arcane symbols, which Bo had taught Nila\nenough to recognize as wards – and the warnings that accompanied them.\nShe followed the ribbon around to the south until she found an\nopening. Deliv cabal guards – immense men with broad shoulders,\ngleaming breastplates, and spiked helmets – stood at attention with muskets\nshouldered.\nShe stepped between them, only to find her way immediately blocked\nby those muskets.\n“Step back,” one of the guards said in heavily accented Adran, the\nwords laced with menace.\nShe did.\nNeither of them so much as looked at her. Glancing from guard to\nguard, she extended one foot slightly, only to watch the tips of their musket\nbarrels slide back across her path. It seemed like something out of a comedy\nplay.\n“I’m looking for Privileged Borbador,” she said, pulling her foot back.\nNeither of the men responded.\n“He’s an Adran Privileged. He was taken to your healers just two\nnights ago.”\nAgain, nothing.\n“I’m here from Field Marshal Tamas. This is an important query,” Nila\nventured. If invocation of Tamas’s name meant anything to the cabal\nguards, they didn’t show it. “Is there someone I should see?” A cold sweat\nbroke out on the back of Nila’s neck. Did these men even know who Bo\nwas? Had Bo reached the Kez cabal alive? The possibility that he had died\non the way crept into her mind and she felt a rising panic."

Maybe if she set fire to their shoes, they wouldn’t be able\nto ignore her any longer.\nA quick glance at the polished bayonets of the guards, and she\nimagined that setting their shoes on fire would be a quick path to a\ndisemboweling. She raised her hands. A demonstration of some kind\nseemed to be in order. There was nothing else for her to do. She still didn’t\nknow how to wield her powers. Without Bo she might as well go back to\nbeing a washerwoman.\n“What do you want?”\nNila nearly jumped out of her skin. A woman had approached from\nbehind one of the guards. Her caramel skin was lighter than most of the\nDeliv and her face was long but beautiful, with high cheekbones and a\nnarrow chin. Her spine was straight, her head held high, and her hands were\nclasped at her waist, clothed in runed Privileged gloves.\n“Make it quick,” the woman said impatiently before Nila could\nanswer. She didn’t look at Nila’s face, but rather over her head, as if Nila\nherself was worth little more than a cursory glance.\n“My name is Nila. I’m looking for Privileged Borbador.”\n“He’s not seeing anyone.”\nNila swallowed, her throat dry. “I’m…” She stopped herself, a warning\ndancing across the back of her mind. “Careful with any Privileged,” Bo had\nsaid, not long after discovering that Nila didn’t require gloves for her\nsorcery. “They detest change. Any change could bring the upset of their\nunrivaled power among the Nine. If a member of a rival cabal discovers\nyour unique ability before you’ve learned to defend yourself, you may wind\nup being cut apart by Privileged surgeons in a dank room somewhere.”\n“I need to see him,” Nila finished.\n“You his whore?”\nShe nearly choked on this. “Excuse me?”\nThe woman’s eyes narrowed and she seemed to look at Nila for the\nfirst time. “Bo’s been letting himself slip. Your skin’s too pale and you’re\ntoo short. By Kresimir, his tastes have gotten worse.”\n“I’m here from Field Marshal Tamas,” Nila said, biting her tongue. “I\nneed an update on Privileged Borbador.”\n“Don’t lie to me, wench. One of Tamas’s men was here an hour ago.\nPit, you must be new. Bo’s always liked the clingy types more than he\nshould. He’s still alive, if that’s what you’re asking. If he still wants you,\nhe’ll find you in a couple of weeks. If he doesn’t, you won’t hear from him\nagain. I suggest you go spread your legs for some Adran officer to occupy\nyour time.”\nNila was near bursting. How could this woman, Privileged though she\nwas, speak to her in such a manner? Even when she was nothing more than\na laundress, the lord and the lady of the house had never been so\ncontemptuous, and Lady Eldaminse had hated her."

Even when she was nothing more than\na laundress, the lord and the lady of the house had never been so\ncontemptuous, and Lady Eldaminse had hated her.\nThe Privileged waved one gloved hand in dismissal. “If you come\naround here anymore, I’ll make sure he never sees you again.” There was\nno malice or threat in her tone of voice. It was just a statement, as casual as\na cook might speak of cutting up a chicken. She turned around and strode\noff without another word, leaving Nila looking for something, anything, to\nsay to her back.\nNila’s hands clenched and unclenched behind her back, and she\nsnatched them to her sides before she caught her dress on fire. She took a\nstep forward, only to find two muskets blocking her path again.\n“You should go,” one of the guards said, a note of sympathy in his\nvoice.\nNila whirled on the ball of her foot and stalked away, wondering if she\nhad the power in her to set fire to the whole damned cabal pavilion before\nthey knew what was happening. A “whore,” that Privileged had called her!\nSpreading her legs for an Adran noble? She could feel the blue flames\ndancing on her fingertips, and balled her hands into fists.\nThat’s what the wards are for, dummy. She could hear Bo’s voice in the\nback of her head. A lick of flame summoned from the Else, directed at that\ncabal camp, and all the pit would come crashing down on her head.\nOn a whim, Nila changed course and worked her way around the\ncordoned cabal camp. Perhaps she should have told the woman that she was\nBo’s apprentice – that she was a Privileged, not some commoner to be\ntreated like trash. Maybe she would have gotten a little more respect.\nThen again, that woman shouldn’t treat anyone like that.\nNila caught sight of a break in the Privileged’s tents and saw the\nsmokeless flames rising from a fire pit. A guard eyed her inquisitive glances\nbut said nothing as she stood on her toes and looked for some sign of Bo.\nThere were a few Privileged and two or three times as many cabal soldiers\nin their heavy armor, carrying heavy pikes and sabers. She wondered that\nthere weren’t more muskets, then remembered Bo mentioning that most\nPrivileged were allergic to black powder and avoided it when possible.\nShe felt a smile touch her lips as she caught sight of white skin among\nthe various shades of black and brown. There was Bo, sitting next to the\nfire, staring disconnectedly into the flames. He looked very pale but\notherwise unharmed. Nila took a breath, a shout on the tip of her tongue,\nbut it caught in her throat as the Deliv Privileged – the same one who had\ndismissed her so rudely – emerged from a nearby pavilion and approached\nBo.\nHe said something to her, but she just shook her head, then stepped\nover to him and pressed her lips to his. He didn’t resist or protest – his\ncheeks flushed and he was soon kissing her back.

She traced a finger down\nhis chest and her hand dipped lower…\nNila was halfway back to the Adran camp before she had another\nrational thought, and she was already at Tamas’s command tent before she\nknew where she was going.\nField Marshal Tamas stood outside the front of his command tent, eyes\nshielded from the sun, and examined a pair of maps laid out on the dirt in\nfront of him, the edges held down by several fist-sized rocks. A couple of\nhis officers muttered as she approached, but no one stopped her.\n“What happened to your dress?” Olem asked.\nShe looked down. It looked like she’d been smeared with soot. The\nbottom half of her dress had two black streaks, as if ink had dripped off her\nhands. She could smell singed cotton. “Nothing,” she snapped. “When are\nwe leaving?”\nTamas snorted, bending down over his maps, but didn’t say anything.\n“We’re camped here for the night,” Olem said. “We’ll leave in the\nmorning.”\n“Oh. Right. When will we meet the Kez on the field?”\n“Sooner than you may wish,” Tamas muttered, barely loud enough for\nher to hear.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n“Nila,” Olem said, a note of warning in his voice.\n“It’s all right, Olem,” Tamas said, still not looking up from his maps.\n“She’s learning how to be a real Privileged, and the insolence goes with it.\nIt means, Privileged Nila, that you are woefully underprepared for what I’m\ngoing to ask you to do.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Slaughter thousands of Kez soldiers. Burn them like tinder. Listen to\ntheir screams as they wither beneath your sorcery.”\nNila balked at that. “Why do you say I’m unprepared? I did it once,\ndidn’t I?” Nila was unprepared. She had blocked that battle out of her mind\nso thoroughly that she’d almost forgotten it, and she felt a wave of nausea at\nthe memory.\n“Because that’s what Bo said,” Olem interrupted.\n“You’ve seen him?”\n“An hour ago. He’s still alive, but he’s in no state to fight. He asked\nme to give you a warning – stay away from the Deliv cabal. We’re to keep\nyour presence a secret until it’s absolutely necessary.”\nNila remembered that Deliv Privileged kissing Bo, her hand reaching\nbetween Bo’s legs. “I’m sure he did,” she said.\nTamas finally looked up, but it was only to exchange a glance with\nOlem.\n“Another messenger coming in, sir,” Olem said.\n“Of course.” Tamas gave a weary sigh.\nA Deliv in his Kelly-green uniform rounded the tent on horseback,\nbarely reining in before his mount trampled Tamas’s maps. “Sir,” the\nmessenger panted. “We’ve been attacked!”\n“The Deliv camp?”\n“The baggage train,” he said.\nTamas leapt into his tent and returned, buckling his sword to his belt.\n“Rouse the troops!” he called to Olem.\n“Sir, they’re already gone,” the messenger said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“They hit and left before we could mount a defense.”"

A glance from Tamas urged caution.\nThe Deliv weren’t supposed to know about her. She took a deep breath,\nfighting the anger and sense of helplessness that threatened to overwhelm\nher.\n“Yes, ma’am,” the messenger said.\n“How the pit did Kez dragoons get behind us?” Tamas demanded.\n“They shouldn’t be… Pit, is that sorcery?”\nNila looked to see what had caught Tamas’s eye. To their northwest,\nlight flashed along the horizon like the sun reflecting off a dozen mirrors.\nShe opened her third eye, slowly so as not to let it overwhelm her, and saw\nthe splashes of pastel color whirling in the distance, fighting something – a\nstrange darkness, the likes of which she had not yet seen in the Else. It\nseemed to swallow all light that touched it, moving like an inky cloud upon\nthe horizon.\nSomething about that darkness touched a nerve in Nila’s subconscious\nand she felt sick with fear.\nDoubt crossed Tamas’s face. Had he seen it too?\n“Our people are giving chase, sir,” the messenger said. “King Sulem\nhas requested your presence.”\n“He better have a damned good explanation. Your people were\nsupposed to be backing up my dragoons to prevent this very thing from\nhappening.”\nNila caught Tamas’s quick glance. “Stay here,” he said quietly. “But be\nready for anything.” Then he was gone, yelling for his horse, Olem close on\nhis heels.\nBe ready for anything, he’d said.\nThat’s a little vague. She looked to the northwest. The flashes of light\nwere now gone, but a chill crept up her spine as she remembered that\ndarkness with which they had warred.\nCHAPTER 31\nT\namas could feel his anger begin to ebb as he arrived at King Sulem’s tent.\nThe Deliv messenger escorted him up to the royal guards, then\nexcused himself and returned to the camp, while Tamas and Olem were\nadmitted immediately. Tamas paused once to look toward the west, where\nhe’d last seen flashes of sorcery, but all signs of the battle had faded. He\ncould still sense that sorcery-swallowing darkness in the Else like a bad\ntaste in his mouth.\nKing Sulem’s tent was not all that different from Tamas’s own, if\nperhaps a bit more spacious. The king was not an ostentatious man. His\nluxuries were limited to fine furs, hardwood chairs, and an intricately\ncarved desk in one corner. His sleeping and dressing chambers were closed\noff from the main room, and a bodyguard stood in each corner, both inside\nand outside the tent, their bayonets fixed.\nSulem sat cross-legged on a fine cushion in the middle of the floor,\nreading glasses perched on his nose and what looked to be some kind of\nreport in his hands. Tamas noted the two Privileged in the room – Magus\nDoranth, head of Sulem’s royal cabal, was a colossus of a man, a head taller"

    "text": "report in his hands. Tamas noted the two Privileged in the room – Magus\nDoranth, head of Sulem’s royal cabal, was a colossus of a man, a head taller\nthan Tamas, with skin as black as night, jade rings on his fingers, and black\nhair tied in a thick knot behind his neck. He stood beside his king, arms\nfolded, and glared at Tamas.\nPrivileged Vivia seemed Doranth’s opposite in every manner. Her skin\nwas the color of coffee with cream and she had blue eyes, hinting at\nancestry that was not fully Deliv. She had a long, slender face that gave her\na queenly visage, and she managed to lounge on one of the hardwood chairs\nin the corner. From what Tamas knew of the Deliv cabal, these were the two\nmajor players – and they disliked each other immensely.\n“Vivia,” Olem whispered in Tamas’s ear, “is the one who’s seeing to\nBo. They go quite a ways back.”\nTamas bowed. “King Sulem. Privileged,” he said, addressing the\ngroup.\n“Magus,” Doranth corrected in a low, rumbling voice.\n“Is a magus not a Privileged?” Tamas asked.\n“You hold the rank of field marshal. Would you rather I call you ‘king-\nkiller’?”\n“Oh, let it go.” Sulem waved a hand at his cabal head. “We can prattle\non all day about honorifics. We have a problem.”\n“I understand that to be the case,” Tamas said. He had not been offered\na seat, so he clasped his hands behind his back and looked down at the\nDeliv monarch, who seemed unbothered by Tamas’s looming over him. It\nwas not the king who spoke.\n“For the past two days, our baggage train has been ravaged by Kez\ndragoons,” Vivia said. Her tone was clipped, and she examined Tamas not\nwith the hostility of Doranth but with a certain amount of wariness.\nTamas swore inwardly. The Deliv baggage train was not just supplying\nthe Deliv but was also providing food, surgeons, and ammunition for the\nAdran army – items his men were running dangerously low on. “I’ve sent\nmy cavalry onto the plains, and last I heard, you had sent three thousand of\nyour own as reinforcements. Are they not getting the job done?” Tamas\nhadn’t had a report in twelve hours; not something that would normally\nhave concerned him, but now he was nervous. He had thought his men\nwould have little trouble mopping up the Kez cavalry who had slipped up\nnorth of them.\n“Our people have had a few losses,” Doranth said.\n“A few?” Vivia said, her tone rising in disbelief. “You have a strange\ndefinition of ‘few,’ Magus.”\nDoranth bared his teeth at Vivia. “You’ll be quiet until you’re\naddressed.”\n“No, I will not be quiet.” Vivia rose from her seat, smoothing the front\nof her Deliv uniform with one hand. “Not while you run this cabal into the\nground.” She turned to Tamas. “We fielded six thousand dragoons and\ncuirassiers forty-eight hours ago. We have less than twenty-seven hundred\nleft.”"

    "text": "ground.” She turned to Tamas. “We fielded six thousand dragoons and\ncuirassiers forty-eight hours ago. We have less than twenty-seven hundred\nleft.”\nTamas reeled at this information. The Deliv weren’t known for stellar\ncavalry, but instead for their finely trained infantry. But that didn’t mean\ntheir cavalry were worthless. Far from it. How could this be possible?\n“Not only that,” she continued, talking over Doranth’s rumbled\nwarning, “but we’ve lost eight Privileged in those two days.”\n“Eight Privileged!” Tamas couldn’t contain his outburst. “How?”\n“This is none of the powder mage’s business,” Doranth said to Vivia,\nadvancing on her quickly. Vivia made a warding motion with her hand,\nthough neither of them wore their gloves.\n“Sit down!” Sulem’s voice cut through the commotion. Both Vivia and\nDoranth returned to their places. The king sighed, like a schoolteacher taxed\nto his limit by unruly students. “The Kez dragoons have a magebreaker. A\nvery, very powerful one. He can null the sorcery of my Privileged even at a\ndistance, and his dragoons are better than any of the cavalry my generals\nhave faced in Gurla. They’ve managed a raid against the main camp each of\nthe last two nights, each time assassinating at least one Privileged.”\n“No magebreaker is that good,” Tamas said.\n“He has those blasted Black Wardens.”\nTamas thought he detected a hint of desperation in Doranth’s voice. It\nhad not occurred to him that the Black Wardens would be that terrifying to a\nPrivileged, but it made sense. Wardens had been created by the Kez cabal to\nhunt powder mages. Black Wardens had been made from powder mages. It\ncouldn’t get much worse than that.\n“Then go after him,” Tamas said. “I’ll bring up my cuirassiers and\nwe’ll perform a sweep of the western plains and crush him together.” He\nfought down frustration even as he spoke. Ipille was outmaneuvering him.\nHe had betrayed a flag of truce, moved his cavalry into position during the\nensuing confusion, and now all he had to do was kill time until they could\nawake Kresimir. They were doing a damned good job of it.\nSulem climbed slowly to his feet and set his report on his desk. He\nremoved his reading glasses, then gave Doranth a long look. The Deliv\ncabal head lifted his chin, and some silent communication passed between\nthem. “Out,” Sulem finally said.\n“My Liege…”\n“Out,” Sulem said again.\nDoranth left, his wide shoulder hitting Tamas on his way past.\n“You, too,” Sulem said to Vivia. The Privileged woman bowed to her\nking and retreated after the cabal head.\nTamas searched Sulem’s face. Something was going on here,\nsomething under the surface. It wouldn’t bode well for either him or his\nmen.\n“My generals are terrified,” Sulem finally said. “This phantom of a\ndragoon has them jumping at shadows. They’ve never lost so many cavalry\nin so little time. He’s quick, he has perfect timing, and his ability to nullify"

He’s quick, he has perfect timing, and his ability to nullify\nthe sorcery of my Privileged has everyone in the army on edge. ‘The Kez\nWolf.’ ”\nTamas wasn’t sure whether to be more impressed by this Kez\nmagebreaker or by the fact that the Deliv had managed to keep all of this a\nsecret from him the past two days. After all, they were supposed to be\nworking with Tamas. His own limitations had forced him to trust the Deliv\nentirely.\n“In just two days, this magebreaker has shattered the confidence of my\ncavalry.”\n“Losing over half their number will do that,” Olem commented\nquietly.\nThe king examined Olem for a moment, as if wondering why a\ncommoner would address him in such a manner, then snorted laughter. “My\nPrivileged will not send out any more riders. They absolutely refuse. You\nmay have seen that battle on the horizon?”\n“Yes,” Tamas said.\n“That was five of my Privileged letting loose on a raid by the Kez\nWolf, just to drive him away from our baggage.”\n“Pit.”\n“Exactly what I thought.” The king drummed his fingers on his desk.\n“Those five Privileged barely killed three-score Kez dragoons. The rest of\nthe company escaped. My generals won’t pursue. They fear a trap.”\nTamas watched Sulem for several moments. Normally so serene, the\nDeliv king seemed uncharacteristically agitated. “We can’t stop to track him\ndown,” he said. “We have to march for Budwiel. We can’t delay.”\n“And let this brigand dog our heels?”\nTamas almost told him about Ka-poel and Kresimir. Sulem needed to\nknow why Tamas was so desperate to march on Budwiel. But it wasn’t a\ntale he cared to explain, nor one that lent itself to believability. “I’ll deal\nwith the Kez dragoons.”\n“I…” Sulem spread his hands.\n“I will deal with it.” Tamas understood that Sulem was not about to\ncall his own men cowards. Sulem’s generals had rarely, if ever, experienced\na battle in which they couldn’t rely on the power of their Privileged. Tamas\nhad been training his men, and himself, to do so for decades – even when\nthere was an Adran Cabal.\nTamas left the king’s tent. It was well past noon, his army was poised\nto march for the rest of the day, and he knew he had to do something about\nthis immediately. “Olem, I…” He paused. Doranth stood nearby, his big\narms crossed, face livid.\nTamas found himself less and less inclined to exercise restraint. He\ncrossed to the Deliv magus. “All the power at your fingertips and you’ll let\na single magebreaker shut you down?”\nDoranth opened his mouth.\n“No,” Tamas said. “No excuses. This is war, not some stupid bloody\npolitical game. If you can’t win it with the tools you have, you make new\ntools. Something you damned Privileged will never understand.”\n“You’re a fool.”\n“And you’re a coward.”"

Something you damned Privileged will never understand.”\n“You’re a fool.”\n“And you’re a coward.”\nDoranth unfolded his arms to reveal he had put on his gloves. He\nthrew his arms wide, like a bear ready to swipe, a snarl on his lips.\nTamas stepped inside Doranth’s guard, even as Olem drew his pistol.\nHe stared up at the towering magus. “No,” he said. “Not a good idea. I may\nbe an old man, but I’m running a mighty powder trance right now and I’ll\ntwist your balls off before you can twitch a finger. You might be able to kill\nme before I can end you, but you’ll die squealing a moment later.\nRemember what I did to the Adran Cabal.”\nDoranth’s arms shook with fury. Moments passed, and Tamas could\nfeel the sweat rolling down his back and wondered idly if he really could\ntake the magus with him. He was getting old. His reflexes weren’t what\nthey once were.\nDoranth lowered his arms and tugged his gloves off. “I will kill you,\nPowder Mage.”\n“I’ll probably be long dead before you get the chance.” Tamas stepped\naway. “Let’s go, Olem.”\nIt wasn’t until they were out of the Deliv camp that Tamas allowed\nhimself a relieved sigh. “Pit,” Tamas said, wiping his brow, “I should not\nthreaten allied Privileged.”\n“I thought it was an interesting tactical choice,” Olem said.\n“And I thought you were around to keep me from doing stupid things.”\n“You looked in control from where I was standing.”\n“Then why did you draw your pistol?”\nOlem shrugged. “Just in case.”\n“You’re a man to inspire confidence.”\n“I try.”\nTamas could sense a plan forming in his head. “Find me Beon je Ipille.\nAnd that Privileged girl. Meet me in my tent in twenty minutes.”\n“His name,” Beon said, “is Saseram.”\nTamas watched Beon through narrowed eyes. He’d undone his jacket,\nas his tent felt warm and muggy despite the cool breeze outside. There was\nan ache deep in his bones, and he wondered how many years it had been\nsince he last had a drink. “That’s a Gurlish name.”\n“That’s because he is Gurlish,” Beon responded.\n“A Gurlish cavalryman, fighting for the Kez? That seems a stretch.”\nTamas glanced at Olem, who had raised a skeptical eyebrow. Nila stood\nbeside him, looking uncertain of herself. She’d changed out of her scorched\ndress and now wore a white daydress with a violet scarf.\n“He changed sides during the third campaign – it was his defection\nthat allowed us to take Delfiss. This was all when I was very young, of\ncourse. All I know is what I’ve heard from father.”\n“I’ve always wondered about Delfiss. So he’s a magebreaker?”\nBeon smoothed the front of his uniform. “Well, I didn’t want to give\nup any state secrets, but if you already know – yes. That was a condition of\nhis defection. He was once a very powerful Gurlish Privileged. My father"

My father\nwasn’t interested in allowing a foreign Privileged the run of his army. The\nway he tells it, Saseram agreed almost too quickly. He willed away his\nPrivileged powers and became a magebreaker.”\n“Magebreakers are former Privileged who are able to nullify sorcery,”\nTamas said to Nila, who was looking more than a little lost. “Most of them\nhad little power to start with, and that’s reflected in how close a proximity\nthey must be to stop magic. I hired one once. He was fairly weak and had to\nbe within spitting distance to stop sorcery. A powerful Privileged turned\nmagebreaker can stop quite a bit more.”\nBeon glanced toward her. “May I ask who this is?”\n“So he’s a Gurlish Wolf rather than a Kez. Why have I not heard of\nthis man?” Tamas asked, ignoring the question.\nBeon’s eyes lingered on Nila for a moment. “Because he changed his\nname when he entered Kez service.”\n“And who was he before that?” The Gurlish Wars had been a bloody\nseries of campaigns half a world away involving most countries in the Nine.\nTamas could think of half a dozen powerful Gurlish Privileged who had\ndied or disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\nBeon smiled in response, and glanced at Nila, but Tamas shook his\nhead. He wasn’t about to reveal Nila’s identity over this. Not just to sate his\nown curiosity. “Anyway,” Beon continued, “he’s been rotting in some\nborder town for the last fifteen years. He’s a bloody good cavalryman,\nmaybe even better than me – and an expert in guerrilla warfare. I imagine\nthat you’ll have a very hard time catching him indeed.”\nTamas didn’t have time for this. A few hours ago, he had been ready to\norder his men to march through the night so he could catch the Kez forces\nat Auberdel. Now he discovered that his allies – fifty thousand strong,\nincluding a third of a royal cabal – had been cowed by a single regiment of\nKez cavalry.\n“Thank you, Beon.”\nThe Kez nobleman seemed to know he was being dismissed. He stood,\nbrushing his hands together, eyeing Nila. She met his gaze, and Tamas\nchuckled inwardly. He had known that there would be a day when the\nAdran Cabal would need to be rebuilt. He had secretly hoped it would be\nlong after his death. But he could do a lot worse than having Borbador and\nNila as its foundation.\nWith Beon gone, Tamas climbed to his feet and rebuttoned his jacket.\n“Olem, have you created a cavalry regiment for your Riflejacks yet?”\n“Yes sir. Six hundred dragoons and three hundred cuirassiers.”\n“Excellent. Take another five hundred cuirassiers – the Fifteenth won’t\nmiss them – and hunt this Gurlish magebreaker down.”\nOlem straightened. “Sir!”\n“You wanted a command, Olem. You’ve got it now. Don’t let me\ndown.”\n“I won’t, sir!” Olem grinned proudly, his shoulders squared."

He held his hands\nbehind his back so that she couldn’t see his nervousness, and wondered if\nhe was making the right decision.\n“You’re going with Olem. Burn those bastards to the ground.”\nHe had the brief satisfaction of her eyes growing wide before he strode\nout into the sunlight to let his men know they would be leaving at first light.\nCHAPTER 32\nA\nfew hours into her ride, as her legs began to cramp and her ass began to\nhurt worse than anything she’d ever felt, Nila wondered if Tamas would\nhave allowed her to say no.\nPerhaps he might have, if it had occurred to her to refuse. She had her\ndoubts. It seemed likely that few people told Tamas no. This was the same\nman who had slaughtered the Adran royal cabal in their sleep and then\nguillotined his own king. One didn’t say no to a man like that. Instead of\nrefusing what sounded like a horribly dangerous mission, she had asked\nhim to give a hastily written note to Privileged Borbador. Tamas had\nseemed slightly put off by the request, but Nila didn’t know who else in the\ncamp she could have asked, and in the end, Tamas agreed.\nShe had an ever-growing notion that this expedition was a terrible idea\nand that it would end with her corpse lying in some farmer’s field. The\ndarkness on the horizon that sorcery could not penetrate, the darkness that\nhad tied her stomach in knots, had been a magebreaker, and she was now\nriding toward him.\n“What the pit good am I going to do?” she asked, trying not to let the\npain come through in her tone. Back straight. Act like the Privileged you\nwant to be.\nOlem stood in his stirrups, looking annoyingly at ease in the saddle,\nhis eyes scanning the horizon. “The idea,” he said, “is that we go straight\nfor the throat. We identify and kill the magebreaker and then you unleash\nyour sorcery on his cavalry.”\nBehind them, a trail of dust rose over thirteen hundred Adran cavalry.\nThey were a stunning sight, she had to admit. The uniforms of the dragoons\nwere dirty and rumpled from the road, but their swords were held straight\nand their carbines laid across their saddle horns, while the breastplates of\nthe cuirassiers shone in the setting sunlight. She now wore a uniform that\nmatched the dragoons – Adran blues with silver trim and red cuffs, and\npants, which were so much better for riding than a dress.\n“Didn’t the Deliv already think of that?”\n“Likely,” Olem said.\n“And they failed.”\n“We’ll just have to succeed where they failed.”\n“Are you going to get me killed?”\nOlem stroked his beard and lowered himself back into his saddle.

Would\nshe still be just Nila the laundress, another soldier’s lover, toiling with the\nrest of the camp followers? Or would she have been captured along with so\nmany others when Budwiel fell, and now be either dead or enslaved?\n“I’ll try not to,” Olem said. He began to roll a cigarette. “If – when –\nwe catch these bastards, I want you to stay near the middle of the column,\nwhere it’s safest.” He paused to lick his rolling paper. “To be honest,\nnowhere is safest in a cavalry skirmish, but that’ll have to do. The\nmagebreaker will have heard about the Battle of Ned’s Creek, but if we’re\nlucky, he won’t suspect that we have a Privileged with us.”\nAnd he won’t see my glow in the Else because of my limited\nexperience, Nila finished silently. “What if I can’t do sorcery?”\n“Keep your head down.”\n“Easy for you to say. You have a sword.”\n“And a pistol and carbine,” Olem said.\n“You’re very reassuring.”\n“That’s what Tamas says, strangely enough.”\n“Tamas? Are you on a first-name basis with the field marshal?”\nOlem grunted. “That was inappropriate of me. Sorry. Nerves are a bit\nfrayed. I’ve ridden with cavalry before, even been in a few skirmishes, but\nthis is my first command.”\n“Oh, now that is reassuring.”\nOlem flinched, and Nila wished she could take it back. “You’ll do\nfine.”\n“Thanks, mother,” he said. “Don’t worry, I’m leaving the heavy lifting\nto my officers. If I do one thing well, it’s pick good men. If I don’t do fine,\nat least they will.”\n“You should give yourself more credit.”\n“Should I?” Olem put the rolled cigarette to his lips, then checked the\ncarbine holstered to his saddle.\n“Yes.”\n“You didn’t.”\nNila jerked back. What was that supposed to mean? “Now wait a\nmoment.”\nHe held up a hand. “Ancient history,” he said. “Forget I said a word.”\nShe scowled at him while he called over one of his officers and gave\nthe order to stake camp. When the man had ridden away, Olem ashed his\ncigarette.\n“I didn’t mean to hurt you,” Nila said.\n“Oh?”\n“I had my reasons,” she continued. Jakob had needed her protection.\nShe hadn’t trusted Tamas at that time, and then she had been carried away\nby Lord Vetas and caught up in Bo’s battles. She wanted to tell him all of\nthat, but she hardly knew where to begin. “I really did like you.”\n“Well, that’s a nice consolation prize.”\n“Don’t be such a dense ass.” Nila’s voice rose. “I wanted to be with\nyou, but I said no because I knew I had to protect Jakob.” Her jaw snapped\nshut, and she blinked at him for several moments, not able to believe she\nhad just said that.\n“Oh,” Olem said, both eyebrows now raised, his head cocked back in\nsurprise."

Part of\nme wishes I had said yes, but as you said – ancient history.”\nOlem remained silent for several minutes, watching his men dismount\nand set up a picket line for the horses, readying the area for a campsite.\nWhen the silence was approaching the point of madness for Nila, he finally\ncrushed his cigarette on his saddle horn and flicked the butt into the long\ngrass. “I’ll have one of the boys find you some good stones that we can\nwarm in the fire. It’ll help the ass-ache.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Hot stones, wrapped in the leather. You put them between your legs\nand all the fiddly bits downstairs won’t hurt as much in the morning.”\nNila decided she’d liked Olem more when he was being bashful back\nin Adopest. This seemed entirely too… forward. “Thank you.”\nOlem merely nodded a reply. His eyes were on something on the\nhorizon.\n“What is it?” she asked.\nOlem removed the looking glass from his saddlebag and held it to his\neye. Nila squinted to the west and thought, beneath the glare of the half-set\nsun, that she could see a rider. She heard a sharp intake of breath, and Olem\nlowered his looking glass.\n“Pack it up, boys!” he yelled over his shoulder. “Kez to the west!”\nThe speed of it all made Nila’s head swim. Within five minutes the whole\nregiment was back in the saddle, the thunder of their hooves ringing in\nNila’s ears and the adrenaline of the chase drowning out the pain from a\nday’s worth of riding.\nOlem ordered out dozens of scouts and formed his men with the bulk\nof the cuirassiers in the middle and the dragoons on the wings as they\ncrested the hill in the waning light of dusk.\nNila could see the distant speck of the Kez rider galloping across the\nplains.\n“Is there anything you can do?” Olem asked.\n“What? I mean, no, what could I do? He’s too far for Privileged\nsorcery, even if I was confident I could hit him at all.”\nHe gave a stiff nod and ordered his men to advance, all while eyeing\nthe scouts fanning out across the plains ahead of them. She could see the\nindecision in his eyes – was this an opportunity or a trap?\nThey proceeded on the trail of the Kez rider. Nila watched as the\ndragoons on their right flank swept up and over a hill to the north, out of\nsight, and their left flank proceeded along a matching arc a quarter of a mile\nout past a distant wheat field. She felt cold, apprehensive of the\ndisappearance of those five hundred cavalry. What if it was a trap?

Less\nthan a mile distant, Nila could see the flickering of campfires and groups of\npicketed horses.\n“We’ve found the enemy camp!” a breathless scout told Olem.\n“I can see that.” Olem gazed through his looking glass, a look of\nconsternation on his face.\n“Could it be a trap?” Nila asked.\n“They’re scrambling like a kicked anthill down there,” Olem said. “It\ncould be a trap… but we may have gotten lucky. Form up!” he bellowed.\n“Three lines, flanking formation!”\nThe cuirassiers split into three equal wedges. One of them took the\nnorth side of the valley while the second went straight down the middle.\nNila’s wedge, with Olem at the head, rode along the southern lip. As they\ndrew closer, Nila could see the Kez begin to ride out in waves from the\ncamp – it was no desperate flight, but an organized withdrawal.\n“Faster, damn it!” Olem yelled. He had his head cocked to the wind,\nand Nila could hear the distant call of bugles from the north and south.\n“We’re in the clear, we’ve got these bastards!”\nNila tried to swallow her terror as her mount kept up with the\ngalloping horde. Down in the valley, she could see their center wedge\nsweep through the Kez camp.\nThe valley was not long. Less than a half mile later, it ended in a\nnarrow, steep hill that brought the Kez cavalry back onto the plains. Nila\nthought the hill would slow them down, but was shocked to see the whole\nregiment fly up it without a stumble.\nOlem’s cuirassiers were a quarter of a mile behind the Kez cavalry and\nit was clear even to Nila’s eyes that they were far too slow to catch them.\nThe cuirassiers were weighed down by their armor and heavier weaponry,\nwhile it appeared the Kez cavalry had lighter weapons and no armor, and\nhad been forced to leave behind bedrolls and supplies when they fled their\ncamp.\nUp ahead, Nila could see the plains begin to roll steadily, flat fields of\nwheat disappearing into a myriad of hills cast in darkness by the sun setting\nbehind the mountains. The Kez would reach those hills soon, and something\nabout those shadows made her shiver.\nShe could hear Olem swearing at the top of his lungs. He bent over his\nmount, urging him faster, and Nila wondered briefly how easy it would be\nfor one of these horses to lose its footing and stumble, taking out the entire\nline behind it. Up ahead something caught her eye, and she couldn’t help\nthe cheer that escaped her lips as Adran dragoons suddenly burst into view\nfrom the north.\nThey were almost on top of the Kez cavalry. She heard the crack of\ngunpowder as pistols were fired. Nila expected to see a milling confusion as\nthe Adrans and Kez locked in battle, but the dragoons turned sharply to\nfollow – they hadn’t been able to cut off the Kez retreat.\nOlem suddenly grabbed Nila’s reins and the two of them pulled out in\nfront of the rest of the cuirassiers. “Fire,” he shouted. “Now!”"

Nila’s mind went blank of all Bo’s lessons and her\nfingers felt numb. The Kez were too far away! How could she possibly get\nany of them?\nRaising her hands, she rolled her eyes back and tried to focus on the\nElse, plucking with two fingers to bring fire racing down on the wind\ntoward the retreating cavalry. To her surprise, flames appeared in the air\nseveral hundred yards away, swirling patterns in the sky above the Kez. She\nmoved her off-hand too much and the flames suddenly slammed into the\nground, showering the area with sparks. Her hands were shaking too hard,\nher concentration too unsteady.\nSlowly, she managed to get her fire under control and send it blazing\nonward. Olem’s dragoons had split to give the fire an avenue. She felt her\nheart hammering in her chest as the flames closed in on their prey, surging\nforward like a wave out of the pit itself. This was her! She had the power to\ncatch them and stop them. She struggled to keep control, shoving the flames\nfarther forward.\nAn inky blackness seemed to reach out of the shadows of the hills and\nNila’s fire suddenly went out. The suddenness of it caught her off guard and\nnearly sent her tumbling from her saddle. She felt a cold hand brush at the\nvery edge of her awareness, and then it was gone.\n“Call them back!” Olem said.\nA bugle played frantically over Nila’s shoulder and she saw the\ndragoons slowly pull up. She reined her mount in, wrestling with the\nexcited horse until Olem snatched her reins from her hands and managed to\ncalm the beast.\n“Why did you call them back?” Nila asked, trying to shake the fear she\nfelt from that blackness.\n“Because I’m not following this Gurlish Wolf into Brude’s Hideaway\nat night.”\n“My fire…”\n“The magebreaker was there. I saw his influence in the Else.”\nNila took a shaky breath. “What’s Brude’s Hideaway?”\n“A bloody labyrinth of hills and valleys that stretch from here all the\nway through the western forest to the Charwood Pile.” Olem leaned from\nhis saddle to spit. “Damn it! We had luck on our side for once – they barely\nsaw us coming – and we lost our chance.”\nNila watched him for a moment, listening absently to the curses of the\nother cuirassiers. No one was happy about this development. “We’re going\nin there, aren’t we?”\nOlem nodded. “Yes, but not until we have daylight on our side.”\nNila wanted to tell him how terrible an idea she thought that was.\nShe’d heard Beon je Ipille’s description of this Gurlish Wolf. Olem had told\nher about the conversation with the Deliv magus. Going into those hills\nagainst the magebreaker was going to get them all killed.\nShe bit back her words and thought about Bo telling her to act like a\nPrivileged.

She felt a flare of jealousy with the memory of that Deliv\nPrivileged leaning over to kiss Bo, and said, “At first light, then. We’ll go in\nafter the bastard.”\nCHAPTER 33\nT\nwo mornings after the bombing, Ricard had moved his entire base of\noperations for the election from the destroyed shell of the Holy Warriors of\nLabor headquarters to a posh hotel in the middle of Adopest.\nLocated just a few blocks from Elections Square, the Kinnen Hotel\nwas one of the few buildings in the center of the city that had escaped\nlooting by the riots after Manhouch’s execution, damage in the royalist\nuprising, as well as severe structural harm from the earthquake in the\nspring. It was a squat fortress of a building only three stories tall, but with a\nfootprint that encompassed an entire city block.\nIt also belonged to Ricard Tumblar, a fact that Adamat thought had\nsomething to do with why it had not been harmed by the riots – it would\nhave been very well guarded by union muscle.\nAnd it was still well guarded, it seemed. Each of the entrances was\nwatched by no fewer than four union men. There were marksmen on the\nroof and armed laborers in the street. Adamat had to show his credentials\nthree times before he reached the grand foyer of the hotel, and even then he\ncould feel eyes on his back as he made his way to the east wing of the\nsecond floor.\nHe was admitted in to see Ricard after showing his papers yet again.\nThe union boss sat with his feet on his desk, chair tilted back, a cigar\nclenched between his teeth and a cold compress against his left temple.\n“No, I don’t care how much it costs,” Ricard was saying to a clerk, his\nvoice just a little too loud. “Buy up every bolt of silk in the city and… oh,\nAdamat!” Ricard waved cigar smoke from his face and shooed the clerk out\nof the room with a single jerk of his chin.\n“You’re buying silk, now?”\n“A little economic warfare,” Ricard said, relishing his cigar smoke.\n“We’ve word that Claremonte has already promised the textile union he’ll\nlower the import price of raw silk if elected. And he can’t do that if I\ncontrol everything in the city stores and keep an eye on what he brings in\nover the mountains.”\n“The textile union?” Adamat slid into a chair, feeling far too grateful to\nbe sitting for a man his age. “Isn’t that your territory?”\n“The union head was killed in the blast last night,” Ricard said. “We’ll\nbe fighting over a new one for months, and in the meantime Claremonte is\ngoing to try to sway their support. And yes, it is my territory. I won’t let\nhim take it.”\n“I still think you should use your emergency powers to appoint a new\ntextile union head right away.” The voice startled Adamat and he stood,\nlooking toward where the voice seemed to come from – a window, where a\nwoman perched beside the curtain with her arm in a sling and a glass of\nwine in her right hand.

She was staring down at the street outside.\nShe was about fifty with rounded cheeks and severe, almond-shaped\neyes. She wore a purple dress with black trim. She gave Adamat a quick\nlook up and down.\n“I’m sorry, ma’am, I didn’t see you there.” He ran through the catalog\nof names and faces in his memory.\nShe raised her wineglass slightly. “Cheris, the —”\n“Head of the bankers’ union,” Adamat finished. “We met briefly a\ncouple of months ago.”\n“I apologize, I don’t remember.” She set her wineglass down just long\nenough to adjust the strap on her sling.\n“I’m Inspector Adamat.”\n“Oh, yes! The Knacked who can’t forget. Ricard has spoken of you a\ngreat deal over the years. I should have remembered you. I do apologize.\nThe things you’ve gone through in the last few months…” She trailed off,\nclucking her tongue sadly.\nAdamat shot Ricard a glance. What was he doing telling this woman –\nor anyone, for that matter – about his problems?\nRicard gave him an apologetic shrug. “Do you have any leads on the\nbombing yesterday?”\n“Should we talk about that in private?”\n“Cheris was with me last night. A beam from the ceiling fell and broke\nher arm right after the explosion. She’ll want to know about this as much as\nI.”\nBut can she be trusted? “You look awfully well for having survived\nsuch a catastrophe,” Adamat said.\nCheris blushed slightly. “If you must know, I’ve had a little mala today\n– for the pain – and more than a little wine.” She gave what Adamat\nsuspected had been meant to be a soft laugh, but it came out as a loud\ngiggle.\n“Of course. It’s to be expected.” Adamat returned to his seat.\n“Did you go with the police yesterday?” Ricard asked.\n“Yes.”\n“And? Do you think it was Claremonte? It was Claremonte, wasn’t it?\nThe bastard. I’ll tear him limb from limb, I’ll —”\n“It wasn’t Claremonte,” Adamat said.\nRicard leapt to his feet and instantly began to pace. “What do you\nmean? Can you be sure?”\n“I’m quite certain,” Adamat said.\nLady Cheris interjected, “But how?”\n“Believe me, ma’am. It wasn’t Claremonte.”\n“I’ll believe you when I know how you can be certain,” Cheris said.\n“He has the means and the motive. He almost certainly ordered it done.”\n“Bah.” Ricard stopped his pacing just long enough to fetch and light\nanother cigar. “If Adamat says it’s not Claremonte, then it’s not Claremonte.\nBut who?”\n“I don’t know yet. I’ve only just begun my investigation. You have\nenemies, don’t you?”\n“No,” Ricard said, sounding somewhat offended. “I make friends. It’s\nwhat I do best. Friends are far more useful than enemies.”\nAdamat gave Ricard a long look.\n“Well, maybe. All right, yes. I have enemies. But not an\noverabundance of them.”"

But not an\noverabundance of them.”\n“Any of them who would want you killed?”\n“I don’t know if any of them hate me that much. Perhaps some of the\nother union bosses. One or two of them have been angling for my job for\nthe last couple of years.”\n“Who?”\n“Jak Long, the head of the blacksmiths’ union. Lady Hether, the head\nof the street cleaners’ union.”\n“She died in the bombing,” Cheris said quietly.\n“Oh. Right.” Ricard stabbed his finger into the air. “The gunsmiths of\nHrusch Avenue might have had something to do with it. They certainly\nknow gunpowder, and they don’t like that I’ve been trying to unionize\nthem.”\n“Do you have candidates for a new textile union head?” Adamat\nasked, voicing a sudden thought before it slipped his mind.\n“Of course. I can’t stand any of them.”\n“And you have the power to just appoint one?”\n“Technically. In an emergency. It would make a lot of people very\nangry, though.”\n“There’s a foreman in the textile mill off of Vines Avenue. Her name is\nMargy. Very intelligent. Might shake things up a little if you appointed her.”\n“An unknown,” Cheris said. “Intriguing.”\n“It’s just a thought. She’s politically conservative, vocal about her\nopinions, but not a troublemaker. She has no love of Tamas or the council,\nbut there’s no chance that she’d back Claremonte. Not after he leveled all of\nthe churches in the city.”\n“Fell!” Ricard yelled. “Fell, where are you, damn it!”\nThe woman appeared in the doorway before he finished his sentence.\nShe gave a slight bow at the waist. “You called, sir?”\n“Look into a woman named Margy. See if she’d make a good\ncandidate for the head of the textile union as an appointee. She’s a foreman\nin the mill in…”\n“On Vines Avenue,” Adamat supplied.\n“Yes. On Vines.”\n“Yes sir. Good afternoon, Inspector.”\n“Good afternoon, Fell.”\n“I’ll send a man over, sir,” Fell said to Ricard.\n“Do it quietly. I don’t want anyone getting wind of this.”\nThe grandfather clock on the far side of the room suddenly chimed\ntwice. Lady Cheris removed a pocket watch from the folds of her dress and\nchecked it, then approached Ricard, kissing him lightly on the cheek. “I\nhave to go.”\n“Come by tonight?”\n“Of course.”\nShe bid Adamat a good afternoon and left quickly. Ricard moved over\nto her spot by the window, his fist under his chin. “What was that?” Adamat\nasked.\n“What was what?”\n“The kiss. Are you two… ?”\nRicard flashed him a tight grin. “Perhaps a little.”\n“I remember you mentioning that she hated you.”\n“It’s an alliance of convenience.

You know how it goes. Passion, politics.”\n“And you’ve never told me?”\n“A man has to have some secrets.”\n“You’ve been married to various wives for much of that time.”\nRicard gave a noncommittal shrug. “Cheris is very smart. And\nambitious. That’s attractive to me. And my money and ambition are\nattractive to her. It’s a match made in the pit. We’ll be back to trying to kill\neach other after this whole thing is over.”\n“Interesting choice of words.”\n“What? Oh. I know what you’re thinking,” Ricard said. “Cheris didn’t\ntry to have me killed. She’d have nothing to gain from it. She’s not in my\nwill and most of the other union bosses hate her. Without my support she’d\nbe out of the union within a year.”\n“I see.” Adamat wasn’t convinced. He’d have to go through his\nmemories later and try to sort out anything he knew about Cheris – or\nanything Ricard had mentioned about her. If the two had been lovers for\nthat long, they had certainly hid it well. It reminded Adamat that boisterous\nand loud though Ricard could be, he also had a talent for subtlety that most\npeople missed.\n“Something good has come about from this whole affair with\nClaremonte,” Ricard said.\n“Oh?”\n“Apparently I have the support of the religious right.”\nAdamat couldn’t help but bark a laugh. “Is that a draft in the room, or\nhas the pit frozen over?”\n“Cigar?” Ricard offered after a quiet laugh. “Glass of wine?” Without\nwaiting for an answer, he shouted for Fell again.\nThe undersecretary appeared once more in the door, a bottle of wine\nalready in one hand and two glasses in the other. “Ahead of you, sir.”\n“Adamat, have I told you that I couldn’t live without this woman?”\nFell poured two glasses and handed one to Adamat, who swirled it\naround and took a sip. He eyed the undersecretary cautiously. Assistant,\npolitical liaison, seductress, bodyguard, assassin. Trained at the most\nexclusive finishing school in the world, Ricard had said. Somewhere\nbetween a slave and an indentured servant, Fell was the most capable\nperson Ricard had brought onto his staff in… well… ever.\nCould she have betrayed him?\nAdamat pushed the thought away. Ricard had let Fell completely into\nhis confidence. If she wanted to kill him, she could have done so any\nnumber of ways. She could have killed or destroyed him several times over\nin the last few months. Unless she had something more long-term in\nmind…\n“Ricard.”\n“Yes?”\n“Can Claremonte really win?”\n“What? Of course not. He’s a foreigner. He destroyed historic public\nproperty. The man is a menace.”\n“Seriously, Ricard.”\nRicard returned to his pacing, wine in one hand and cigar in the other.\nHe paused on the opposite side of the room and drained the rest of the glass\nin one long draught."

Adamat turned to Fell, who had slipped\ninto a chair along the back wall of the suite. She had one foot tucked under\nher and the opposite knee pulled up to her chest – no mean feat in a black\ntailored suit. “Can Claremonte win?” he asked her.\nShe glanced at Ricard, then said, “He has a good chance. He has\nmanaged to gain a remarkable amount of support in just the last few weeks\n– much of it had already been arranged through intermediaries.”\n“Lord Vetas?” Adamat asked, the very name making his skin crawl.\n“Some,” Fell admitted. “That’s what he’d been in town doing, after all.\nPaving the way for Claremonte. When we took Vetas, we got a list of names\nof people he’d bribed, cajoled, and threatened into backing Claremonte.\nSome of them we’ve been able to turn. Others are still in his pocket.”\n“But it’s worse than we thought.”\n“Much worse,” Fell said. “Several of the prominent gunsmiths have\nbacked him and – coincidentally – the Brudania-Gurla Trading Company\nhas signed countless new contracts for Hrusch rifles. Dozens of big\nmerchants are campaigning for him and will not even see our people. We\nthink they fear the Trading Company and the power they have over\nshipping. His public approval is high because of his perceived protection of\nthe city.”\n“I saw that in the newspaper the other day,” Adamat said. “He claims\nthat the Kez haven’t dared attack the city ever since his army arrived. No\nword about Field Marshal Tamas or the Adran army.”\n“Of course,” Ricard said. “This is politics, after all.”\nAdamat let out a disbelieving sigh. “He could win… and a foreigner\nwould hold the highest position in our country. You realize that Tamas\nwould never let that happen.”\n“He can’t stop it.”\n“Have you met Tamas? He would storm the city and kill Claremonte\nhimself. I don’t see how we could dissuade him.”\n“This will be the first election in the history of Adro,” Fell said. “If\nTamas disrupts that, he will destroy everything we’ve worked for.”\nRicard said, “We’ll have to deal with that when we come to it. In the\nmeantime, we still have a murderer at large.”\n“You’re worried he’ll try again?” Adamat asked. “You’ve certainly\ntightened security.”\n“Of course I am. I don’t have hearing in one ear because of whoever\nplanted that bomb, and several of my top union bosses are dead or injured.\nThey’ll try again, or I’m a shoemaker.” Ricard gave Adamat a fraught look,\nand Adamat realized how incredibly desperate his friend had become. He\nput on his airs, but the attempt on his life had shaken him deeply. And he\nwas really worried that Claremonte would win the election.\n“We have another problem,” Ricard said quietly.\n“Another?” Adamat tried not to sound too tired. He failed."

He failed.\nRicard hesitated a moment.\n“Go on,” Adamat said. “Tell me.”\n“Charlemund has escaped.”\n“Excuse me?” The former Arch-Diocel of Adro was not only a traitor\nbut a formidable killer. “I thought he was in a coma.”\n“He was,” Fell said. “We think that Taniel Two-shot’s savage Bone-\neye put him in that coma in order to bring Taniel back. Some kind of\nmagical exchange. Whatever it was, it wore off. We had Charlemund\nhidden, tied down. His body was guarded at all times. He escaped and\ndisappeared without a trace. We still haven’t figured out how.”\n“Sweet Kresimir,” Adamat swore.\n“He got away about three weeks ago,” Ricard said. “Cut his ropes and\nknocked out his guards and just walked off. We’ve had people quietly\ncombing the city for him ever since.”\n“No sign of him?”\n“None at all. Like he vanished into thin air.”\nAdamat nodded tiredly. “I’ll keep my ear to the ground. I’m going to\ngo down to the ruins of your headquarters. They’re still sealed off, correct?”\n“Yes,” Fell said. “We asked the police to keep everyone out, and we\nhave one or two of our own men down there keeping an eye out.”\n“Good. I’m going to see if the police missed anything. Do you think I\ncould borrow you for a couple of hours, Fell?”\nFell looked to Ricard, who nodded. “Go ahead. I hope you can find\nsomething.”\n“As do I.”\n“Thanks for your help,” Ricard said. “You don’t know how much it\nmeans to me to have someone I can trust doing the footwork. I would send\nFell out, but she’s running my whole campaign. This investigation could\ntake months.”\n“You sure you can spare her at all?”\n“For a few hours. We need to find out who did this.”\n“I’ll work on that,” Adamat said. “You work on winning the election.\nBecause if you don’t, Field Marshal Tamas is going to start another war,\nand this one will have Adopest right in the center of it.”\nCHAPTER 34\nT\nhe blasted remains of the union headquarters looked somehow worse in\nthe light of day.

    "text": "recycled within days so they could start the process of rebuilding.\n“Bloody mess,” SouSmith commented from behind Adamat.\nAdamat shoved at a piece of fallen roof. When it became clear he\nwouldn’t be able to move it, he climbed on and over it until he was able to\nget back on his feet near the center of the great room. To his surprise, no\none had shut off the pumps to the fountain in the middle of the grand hall. It\nwas still running, practically undamaged, creating a strange sort of serenity\nin the midst of all the destruction.\nSouSmith paused to reach into the fountain and pull out a silver ten-\nkrana coin. He balanced it on his thick thumb and flicked it in the air,\ncatching it with his other hand. “Don’t know what you’re gonna find,” he\nrumbled.\n“Me neither,” Adamat said. He was beginning to think he’d wasted his\ntime in coming here. Two days since the blast and the whole thing had been\ntrampled over by Ricard’s men and the police. What little evidence that\nmight have pointed toward the culprit was long gone by now. Only\ninvestigative instinct kept him from leaving this place behind to go find\nsome breakfast.\nHe worked his way through the rubble until he reached the back of the\nbuilding. “I’m shocked more people weren’t killed,” he said.\n“How many?” SouSmith asked.\n“Thirteen casualties,” Adamat said. “Another twenty-seven injured.\nThere were three hundred people here the other night. It could have been\nmuch worse.” At the rear of the building Adamat entered what used to be\nthe hallway leading to Ricard’s office. The office was a total loss. It didn’t\ntake a professional to tell that this had been the epicenter of the blast. All\nfour walls were gone, the desk was nothing more than splinters, and the\nfloor had all but caved in.\nAdamat heard the scrape of boots in the rubble and turned to see Fell\napproaching from the way they’d come. SouSmith tipped his hat to the\nundersecretary but remained silent, eyeing her with obvious suspicion.\n“The police said the powder barrel was under his desk,” she said.\nAdamat looked over the room once more. Yes, that seemed right. He\nstepped carefully into the room, testing the floor with every step, half\nexpecting what was left of it to collapse beneath him. He could see the dark\nof the basement beneath the remaining tiles. He crossed to the middle of the\nroom and envisioned how it had been set up, using his mind’s eye to\nexamine the memory of Ricard’s office. He held his hands about where the\ndesk would be, and imagined sitting at the desk.\nThere was something wrong about this.\n“What else did they tell you?” Adamat asked. He hadn’t gotten the\nchance to speak with the chief inspector yet, but had a lunch-time\nappointment for that very purpose. It would be useful to get two different\nperspectives on this.\nFell kicked idly at a piece of masonry and pulled a pipe out of her\npocket. She set the stem on the corner of her lip and struck a match. After\npuffing it to life, she said, “That there were two bombs.”\n“Two?” That was a surprise. “Where was the second?”\n“In the basement.”"

    "text": "puffing it to life, she said, “That there were two bombs.”\n“Two?” That was a surprise. “Where was the second?”\n“In the basement.”\nThere was no evidence of the second bomb until they reached the\ncellar stairs. The door to the cellar was gone and there was less left of the\nstairs than there had been of Ricard’s office. The marble floor was cracked\nand seemed to crumble beneath their feet. One of Ricard’s men had left a\nladder there so they could access the basement. Adamat climbed down into\nthe dark.\nThe cellar was of the kind found beneath old manors: a vaulted ceiling\nwith thick, stone arches. Adamat could feel the crunch of glass beneath his\nfeet. He could make out a stone alcove behind where the stairs used to be\nand black scorch marks along the wall.\n“Shall we come down?” Fell asked.\nAdamat answered by climbing back up the ladder and joining her and\nSouSmith in the ruin. “The bombs were set off by a quick-burning fuse,\ncorrect?”\n“That’s what the police think,” Fell said. “They think that the culprit\nwaited until the offices were all clear, came in through the back, and\nquickly placed two black powder kegs, rolled the fuse out into the alley\nbehind the building, lit it, and ran.”\nAdamat took a deep breath of Fell’s pipe smoke and drummed his\nfingers on his stomach. “Do you know anything about a person not having a\nshadow?”\n“What does that have to do with the investigation?”\n“Nothing. Just curious.”\nFell considered this for a moment. “Doesn’t sound familiar.”\n“A pity.” He let out a sigh and returned to the matter at hand. “I can\nmake three easy assumptions of the assassin. Whoever did this was just\nhired muscle. They were hired by someone who knew Ricard well. And\nthey didn’t want to kill everyone in the building.”\n“How do you determine that?”\n“One: The kinds of people who want to kill Ricard won’t dirty their\nown hands. Two: They dropped the first barrel under Ricard’s desk. Ricard\nloves his parties, but he likes to stay relaxed by slipping out about halfway\nthrough the night for a quick dalliance with whatever young lady happens\nto be handy.”\nFell gave a quick nod, the corners of her mouth turning up slightly at\nthat. “But why the second barrel?” she asked. “The floors were reinforced\nbecause of the way Ricard had had this place built. They should have\nplaced the barrel in the middle of the cellar, where the blast could have\nkilled the people standing above it.”\n“Why did Ricard build the cellar that way?”\n“So he had ‘someplace evocative to take his guests to pick out wine,’ ”\nFell said, slipping into a startlingly accurate impression of Ricard. She let\nthe impression drop and Adamat could see the realization hit.\n“He loves to show off his wine collection,” Adamat said. “For a party\nlike the one last night, the assassin had a very good chance of catching\nRicard either in his office or in the cellar. Those two spots would allow for\nthe best chance of killing Ricard without killing everyone else in the\nbuilding.”\nSouSmith flipped his silver coin in the air and caught it coming back\ndown. “Doesn’t help us.”"

    "text": "the best chance of killing Ricard without killing everyone else in the\nbuilding.”\nSouSmith flipped his silver coin in the air and caught it coming back\ndown. “Doesn’t help us.”\n“It does help us,” Adamat disagreed, “if only a little. The person would\nhave to know Ricard fairly well to know those two items. Or else they had\nan inside source who does. Regardless, it lets us narrow in on the few dozen\npeople who knew Ricard best, rather than spend our time combing through\nthe whole of Adopest.”\nSomething else was bothering Adamat, and he couldn’t quite place it.\nThe explosion was… off in a way that he couldn’t grasp.\nHe left SouSmith and Fell near the cellar stairs and went back to\nRicard’s office. Tracing the blast patterns on the floor and remnants of the\nwall, he worked his way carefully around the room and then into the\nhallway. Once he was satisfied with that, he borrowed a lantern from the\npoliceman in the street and descended into the basement, where he traced\nout the blast pattern and examined the walls.\nThe whole process took about an hour. Fell sifted through the bits of\npapers remaining in Ricard’s office and SouSmith idly flipped his coin.\nWhen Adamat finished, he went to Ricard’s office and cleared his throat.\nFell looked up from the floor, her eyebrows raised.\n“The blasts were far too big for the size of the barrels,” Adamat\nannounced.\nFell scoffed. “You couldn’t possibly know that just by looking.”\nAdamat tapped the side of his head. “Perfect memory. It makes\neyeballing measurements much easier. I’ve seen my fair share of explosions\nand I don’t have to be a scientist in these matters to see that the destructions\ncaused by the barrels downstairs and at Ricard’s desk were far more\nthorough than would have fit in those two places.”\n“Could it have been a powder mage?”\n“Perhaps. It would explain the other thing I realized.”\n“Which was?”\n“I thought the barrel had been placed under the basement stairs. But it\nwasn’t. It was right in the middle of the basement hall, where anyone could\nhave stumbled over it.”\n“That makes sense if they were trying to do this quickly.”\n“It’s… too quick. Ricard has dozens of servants. Maybe fifty or sixty\non the night of one of his parties. The chances of both his office and the\nbasement being empty are incredibly slim.” He paused to examine the\noutside wall of the office and then went back to the basement stairs, noting\nthe long hallway leading to the basement. He did some mental math, then\nreturned to Fell and SouSmith. “Someone could have thrown the explosion.\nIt would require two people working together, but that’s not out of the\nquestion.”\n“A grenado,” SouSmith said.\n“Like a grenado, yes. But much more powerful.”\n“We’re going back to a powder mage,” Fell said. “One of Ricard’s\nenemies could be employing a foreign powder mage. I’ve heard of\nmercenary mages.”\n“As have I. But no, I think not. As I understand it, mages are limited\nby the power of the black powder they use. They could warp a small blast\nto allow them to kill more people, but not enough to cause this much\ndestruction to the whole building.”"

    "text": "by the power of the black powder they use. They could warp a small blast\nto allow them to kill more people, but not enough to cause this much\ndestruction to the whole building.”\n“Some kind of refined black powder could do it. Something that packs\nmore of a punch than the traditional kind.”\n“It would,” Adamat said slowly. “And I think it’s the best lead we\nhave. Tell Ricard I’ll be looking into a few places.”\n“Good luck,” Fell said. “And don’t get yourself killed.”\nAdopest University had seen better days.\nAdamat’s cane tapped on the cobbles as he made his way through the\nmyriad of stone buildings that made up the university. This was the same\nwalk he’d taken just six months ago on the day of Field Marshal Tamas’s\ncoup and Manhouch’s execution. Now the brown and orange of fall filled\nthe trees, and the world seemed a little older. But that wasn’t the only\ndifference.\nThe center of the university looked like a battleground. The western\nfaçade of Banashir’s Hall was missing and the old clock tower that had\nonce dominated the skyline was no more than a squat ruin, looking bare in\nthe fall weather. It had been knocked over by sorcery in a battle between\ntwo Privileged and had landed on the once-mighty glass atrium – the pride\nof the university. Entire buildings were roped off, sitting idle while the\nuniversity sought to raise money for their rebuilding.\nThe scene acutely reminded him of both the destruction at the union\nheadquarters and the aftermath of the earthquake that had occurred four\nmonths ago. Adamat knew that Tamas had meant well with his coup, and\nthis destruction was not all a result of his actions, but Adopest had taken a\nhorrible beating since that fateful day.\nAdamat took to the stairs in the rear entrance of the administration\nbuilding and paused when he realized he was alone.\nHe retraced his steps to find SouSmith staring at the destruction in the\nquad outside of Banashir’s Hall. The earth had been cut up as if with an\nenormous plow, great mounds and furrows that would take a hundred men\nseveral weeks to even out. Adamat wondered why the university hadn’t yet\nrestored the fields, but he realized they likely lacked the funding.\n“What’s wrong?” Adamat asked.\nSouSmith held the silver krana coin he’d taken from the union\nheadquarters. He flicked it in the air and caught it. “Thinking.”\n“About?”\nThe old boxer didn’t respond as he flipped the coin several more times,\ncatching it each time without looking. “That Privileged I punched.”\n“When you were a kid?”\nHe nodded and let out a sigh.\n“Lucky he didn’t do something like this” – Adamat gestured to the\ndestruction – “to your insides.”\n“Yup.”\n“Just proves that they can be hurt. That they’re fallible. No one’s\nperfect, even the people with the power to do this kind of thing.”\n“More scary,” SouSmith grunted. He stuffed his hands in his pockets\nand trudged along in the same direction Adamat had been going.\nAdamat had heard that the administration building had taken\nsignificant damage during the Privileged battle.

    "text": "Adamat had heard that the administration building had taken\nsignificant damage during the Privileged battle. Inside, it was clear where\nthey’d focused their reconstruction efforts. Sections of the north wall and\nthe roof were all new. The art that had once lined the main hall – of vice-\nchancellors in the history of the university – had been taken down or\ndestroyed.\nHe passed the office of Vice-Chancellor Prime Lektor and paused just\nlong enough to note there was dust on the handle. He rapped on the next\ndoor.\n“Come,” a muffled voice responded.\nAdamat entered the tidy office of the assistant to the vice-chancellor.\nUskan sat behind his desk, book open flat before him, glasses perched on\nthe end of his nose. He looked up from his reading and gave Adamat a tight\nsmile. “Good afternoon.”\n“Hello, my friend,” Adamat said. “Thank you for seeing me at such\nshort notice.”\n“Of course.” Uskan sat up and brushed the hair from his brow.\n“Anything for a government official.”\n“It’s not like that,” Adamat said, feeling his heart skip a beat. Uskan\nhadn’t offered him a place to sit. His manner was forced, and his eyes were\nnot trusting. Adamat knew his friend was politically conservative, but…\n“It’s not? So they’re not calling you Tamas’s hound?”\n“Not within earshot, anyway,” Adamat said. “I thought you knew I\nwas working for Tamas.”\n“Tamas’s reign has brought nothing but ruin to the university,” Uskan\nsaid. “The last time you were here, you told me you were involved, but not\nthat you were running errands for our new dictator.”\n“He’s not a dictator,” Adamat said.\n“Oh?”\nAdamat dropped into the chair in front of Uskan’s desk. He didn’t have\nthe energy for this. “Tamas is reported dead, anyway.” He eyed Uskan,\ngauging his reaction to see if word had reached him yet of Tamas’s return.\n“It’s all in the past.”\n“And because of him we’ll have no future.”\n“I don’t want to talk politics with you. I just hoped you’d answer a few\nquestions.”\n“As I said, anything for a government stooge.”\n“Uskan!”\n“Adamat, I will help you, but I will not be happy about it!”\nAdamat drummed his fingers on Uskan’s desk. “Where’s the vice-\nchancellor?”\n“Away. Tamas put him in charge of the eastern front after South Pike\nerupted. Why, I have no idea. The man’s a scholar, not a warrior. And we\ndesperately need him here helping us rebuild the university. Tamas has –\nhad – taken it upon himself to ruin Adopest University and —”\nAdamat cut him off. “He sent him because the vice-chancellor is a\nPrivileged.”\n“You’re joking.” Uskan seemed to find this genuinely funny, but his\ndry chuckle trailed off after a moment.\n“I saw his gloves on Saint Adom’s Day,” Adamat said. “He’s a\nPrivileged and even you, locked in here with your books, will have heard\nhe’s one of Tamas’s councillors. You trust him, don’t you?”"

I’ve known Prime Lektor for most of my life.”\n“And how much money have the Holy Warriors of Labor donated to\nthe university since the midsummer?”\n“What does that have to —”\n“Just answer the question.”\n“Several million krana. They’re the only ones who have really given\nus any support.”\n“Well, right now I’m on a case for Ricard Tumblar, the head of the\nunion, who is another one of Tamas’s councillors. Give Tamas a little credit.\nHe’s trying to do good by all of us. Don’t blame everything on him. You\nhave to look beyond your books, Uskan. If Tamas hadn’t been caught\nbeyond enemy lines, I suspect he would have paid a little more attention to\nthe disaster here.” Adamat would have liked to think so anyway. Was he\nsaying all this to convince Uskan, or himself?\nUskan raised his nose indignantly. “You speak as if he’s still alive.”\n“He is. I’ve seen him myself.”\n“You just told me he was dead. And now that he is alive. What am I\nsupposed to believe?”\n“I only said that it was ‘reported’ he was dead.”\n“To try to trick me into —” Uskan stopped himself with a frustrated\nsigh. “There’s no need for any of this. What was it you needed to know?”\n“Do you know anything about why a person might not have a\nshadow?”\nUskan blinked at Adamat for several moments. “What? Well, no. I’ve\nnever heard of that before.”\n“That’s too bad.” Adamat tried not to let his disappointment show.\nAnother dead end. Adamat had hoped Uskan, of all people, might have\nheard something in all his studies. “Could it be a side effect of being a\nKnacked or a Privileged? I know you’ve made a hobby of sorcery studies.”\nUskan rested his chin in the palm of his hand and stared at something\nabove Adamat’s head. After several moments he finally said, “No. Nothing\nat all.”\nAdamat hoped that his old friend was not withholding information just\nout of spite. “Anything in any of the books on sorcery in your library?”\n“Many of those were destroyed or vandalized before you came looking\nafter your last mystery. You’re welcome to look, but I doubt you’ll find\nanything. I can let you into the library, but I don’t have the time to help you\nlook.”\n“Thank you, but I’m here on more important business, to be honest.\nI’m curious if you’ve heard about anyone experimenting with black\npowder.”\n“In what way?”\n“Refining it. Creating something better, more destructive. More\nexplosive.”\nUskan tapped a finger on his chin. “Now, that I can help you with.”\nAdamat perked up. A lead? “Oh?”\n“There’s a chemical company out on the west side of the city. They\nmake and import gunpowder for the Adran army, and they employ several\nchemists who make powder of various consistencies and burning\ntemperatures.

Very important for artillery, bombs, and all that. I heard\nearlier this summer that they were working on something called ‘blasting\noil.’ Something they want to use in mining.”\n“Do you remember their name?”\n“The Flerring Powder Company.”\n“Excellent.” Adamat got to his feet. This was exactly what he was\nlooking for.\n“There’s something else,” Uskan said.\nAdamat paused, concerned by the sudden bleakness of Uskan’s voice.\n“What is it, my friend?”\nUskan stared at his fingers for several moments before answering.\n“The vice-chancellor – Prime Lektor – has fled the country.”\n“He what?”\n“He fled. I caught him here about three weeks ago, collecting things\nfrom his office. He cleaned everything out, sold his home in the\ncountryside, and left. He told me that I should flee too.”\n“Why on earth would he do that?”\n“He said that Adom was dead. Kresimir was coming back and with\nhim something worse. And that we’d all burn for Tamas’s mistakes.” Uskan\nrubbed his sleeve across his eyes. “The man was my idol, Adamat. I’ve\nknown him for decades and he’s been calm, unflappable Prime. But when I\nsaw him that night, he looked like a madman on the verge of hysterics. He\nleft me here, alone. He said I was the new vice-chancellor if I wanted to be,\nbut told me I’d be dead within months if I decided to stay.”\n“Uskan, I’m sorry.”\nUskan sniffed and wiped his eyes once more, sitting up straight.\n“Nothing to be sorry for. You’re right, I need to look beyond my books. I’ve\nbeen rather fraught since the battle on the campus, but I thought we’d\nrebuild. I figured Prime would help us create everything anew. And now\nhe’s gone.”\n“Is there anything I can do for you?”\n“If Tamas is still alive… well, put in a good word for the university.”\n“Of course.”\nAdamat rounded the desk to put a hand on Uskan’s shoulder. “You’re\nright, you know. I shouldn’t have gotten involved in any of this. It’s hurt the\npeople I love in so many ways.”\n“I don’t think it’s your fault,” Uskan said.\n“Thank you for that.”\nSouSmith, still leaning on the door frame of the tiny office, cleared his\nthroat.\n“Yes,” Adamat said. “Well, I should get going.”\n“Wait.”\nAdamat stopped just outside the office and turned back to Uskan.\n“You should check a private library,” Uskan said. “Someone who will\nhave books not accessible to us or to the Public Archives.”\n“I’m open to suggestions.”\n“Charlemund’s manor,” Uskan said. “The Arch-Diocel had an\nenormous library before he was arrested. It’s meant to be split between\nAdopest University, the Public Archives, and Jileman University, but we\nhaven’t had the time to work on it.”\n“And it’s at his manor still?”\n“Under guard, I think.

But not inaccessible to someone with friends in\nhigh places.” Uskan gave him a lopsided smile.\n“I’ll look into it. Thank you very much.”\nOut in the hallway, SouSmith fell in beside Adamat as they headed\nback toward their carriage. “Anything?” he asked.\n“I have two leads now,” Adamat said. “We’ll sniff it out. I know we\nwill.”\n“What was that about the vice-chancellor?”\n“He fled the country, apparently.” Adamat fiddled with the head of his\ncane. “I’m curious what he knows that we don’t.”\nCHAPTER 35\nT\namas sat brooding in a cloth folding chair in front of the tent his soldiers\nhad set up for him to take his lunch.\nHis last report from Olem arrived twenty-four hours ago, letting him\nknow that they were going into Brude’s Hideaway to hunt the Gurlish\nmagebreaker and his Kez cavalry. Tamas couldn’t help but glance to the\nnorthwest, wondering why Olem hadn’t sent his morning report. Two a day,\nTamas had ordered. It was vital that he be kept abreast of the situation on\nthe western plains if he was to proceed against the Kez armies to his south.\nThe messenger’s horse may have thrown a shoe, or he might have been\nsent off a few hours late. Tamas chewed on the inside of his cheek. Olem\nmay have been defeated in battle, for all he knew. Whether it was a portent\nof ill or not, he didn’t like the lag in communication.\n“Olem!” he shouted.\n“Olem’s not here, sir.” Andriya, one of Tamas’s powder mages,\nappeared from inside his tent. He was a tall man with scraggly blond hair\nand a pockmarked face.\n“Bloody pit.” Tamas rubbed at his temples. “How many times is that?”\n“Seventeen in the last four days.”\n“Sorry. Habit, I suppose. Damn bodyguard has been with me less than\na year and I’m already doing that.”\nAndriya picked at his teeth with one fingernail and turned to spit.\n“Funny, sir, but when Cenka died and you got Olem to replace him, you\nnever confused the two.”\n“Surely I must have.”\nAndriya shrugged. “Maybe. That’s fine, I never liked Cenka anyway.”\n“You don’t like anyone.”\n“I liked Erika,” Andriya said after a moment of introspection.\n“My late wife saved you from the hangman’s noose in Kez. I certainly\nhope you liked her.”\n“It wasn’t just that,” Andriya said. “She had a certain” – he made a\nrolling motion with one hand – “something about her.”\n“I know,” Tamas said quietly.\nIf Andriya noticed Tamas’s discomfort, he didn’t show it. He leaned on\nhis rifle and began to pick at his nails again. “Messenger coming in, sir.”\nTamas stood up and stretched, trying not to look too eager. Had Olem’s\nman finally arrived?

The messenger coming in was not one of Olem’s.\nHe was an outrider, a scout with the Second Brigade, keeping track of the\nKez movements to the south. Someone was following the scout. As they\ndrew closer, Tamas could see it was a woman in a gray woolen dress and a\ntan apron. Tamas knew that uniform. It was the clothing given to camp\nfollowers in the Kez army.\nThe scout said something to the woman and she stopped a ways off\nwhile the scout approached. He saluted. “Sir. Found this woman early this\nmorning making her way toward our camp. She said she has news, and it’s\nurgent.”\n“And you brought her to me?” Did chain of command mean nothing in\nthis army anymore?\n“She wouldn’t talk to anyone else. She had the right passwords.”\n“Passwords?”\n“I’m one of your spies, you daft man,” the woman said in Kez, her\nvoice husky, her tone impatient.\nAndriya let out a laugh. Tamas silenced him with a glance and looked\nat his other bodyguards. Andriya seemed to be the only one present who\nspoke Kez, other than Tamas himself. The rest hadn’t understood her. “Let\nher through.”\nThe woman approached. She looked about thirty, with raven hair,\nbrown eyes, and hollow cheeks – she could have fit in anywhere in the Kez\ncountryside. Her dress was well kept but covered in stains, her knees and\nelbows caked with mud, likely from crouching in the long grasses on her\nflight from the Kez camp.\n“Would you like to clean up?”\n“No time, but I could damn well use a drink.” Her switch to Adran was\nso flawless that Tamas wondered if he’d imagined her speaking Kez a\nmoment ago.\n“Get her some water,” he told Andriya.\n“Wine.”\nTamas rolled his eyes but nodded. “All right. I didn’t know we had any\nspies left in the Kez army.”\n“There are few enough,” she said. “There was a purge about seven\nweeks ago. Like someone gave them a Kresimir-damned list of names. It\nwas pure luck that I didn’t get nabbed as well. I haven’t been able to use\nany of our normal channels to send reports – you’ve gotten nothing from\nme for weeks and for that I’m sorry.”\nTamas put his hands behind his back and gave a sharp nod. “Glad you\nmade it out alive.” Inside, he was seething. General Hilanska, no doubt.\nWhen this whole thing was over, he was going to drop Hilanska into the\ndeepest part of the Adsea and see how long he could swim with that one\narm. “What’s so urgent that you had to leave your cover?”\nThe woman took an offered wineskin from Andriya and drained half of\nit before answering. “Aside from the intelligence I haven’t been able to pass\non for the last month? I slept with General Fulicote last night. You know\nwho he is?”\nTamas nodded. One of Ipille’s many infantry commanders. As far as"

    "text": "on for the last month? I slept with General Fulicote last night. You know\nwho he is?”\nTamas nodded. One of Ipille’s many infantry commanders. As far as\nKez command went, he was a decent commander. He’d commanded a\nbrigade in the Gurlish Wars twenty years ago.\n“Then you know he’s a teetotaler, like you. Well, last night he was piss\ndrunk.”\n“Why?”\n“Ipille has ordered the entire Grand Army to make a stand at the mouth\nof Surkov’s Alley.”\n“So? That doesn’t seem like an unreasonable order.”\n“So?” the woman retorted, before draining the rest of the wineskin.\n“So Ipille doesn’t think he can win. He’s been with the army for the last two\nmonths and now he’s turning tail and running back to Kez. General Fulicote\nand all the rest have been ordered on what they know is a suicide mission.\nIpille told them that any man who runs from the battle will be caught and\npublicly flayed.”\n“Do you have proof of this?”\nThe woman removed a letter from her bodice and smoothed it against\nher skirt before handing it to Tamas. It bore the royal seal of the Kez king,\nhastily broken by a clumsy thumb. Tamas opened the letter and skimmed\nthe contents. Ipille was ordering his men to make a stand, but the final\nthreat at the end allowed Tamas to read between the lines, just as General\nFulicote and this spy had done: The Kez army wasn’t meant as anything\nmore than cannon fodder to slow down Tamas and the Deliv.\nTamas returned to his chair, deep in thought. “What could he possibly\ngain by this?” he muttered.\n“The Kez have all been asking the same thing of you since you\nattacked after the parley.”\nTamas was up on his feet again. “That was Ipille. He broke that\nparley.”\n“That’s not what his officers think. I’ve managed to spend the night\nwith four senior Kez officers since then and not a single one of them thinks\nIpille actually broke the parley. They’re convinced that you and the Deliv\nfabricated the whole thing so you could push into Kez and try to dethrone\nIpille.”\n“I would do no such thing.” Tamas shook his head. Why was he\nexplaining himself to a spy? A niggle of doubt had entered his mind. If\nIpille hadn’t launched the attack on his men during the parley in order to\nkidnap Ka-poel, then who had?\nHe didn’t have time to wonder. If Ipille was fleeing and throwing his\nwhole army away, that meant he had some kind of plan. Whether he meant\nto force Ka-poel to awaken Kresimir or he planned to retreat to his capital\nand spend the winter raising levies and trying to forge alliances among the\nNine, it didn’t matter. Tamas needed to end this quickly.\n“Report to General Arbor, he’ll see that you get somewhere to rest,” he\nsaid over his shoulder. “Andriya, get my horse!” He ran into his tent and\nsorted through his maps until he found one of southern Adro.\nThirty minutes later he strode into Sulem’s command tent.

The Deliv\nking was surrounded by half a dozen members of his royal cabal and five of\nhis generals. “We need to speak,” Tamas said.\nSulem shushed the angry mutters of his generals and cabal with a\nraised hand. “Everyone out,” he said.\nThey were alone within moments. “Do you read Kez?” Tamas asked.\n“Yes.”\nTamas handed him Ipille’s orders to his general. Sulem read the letter\ntwice and examined the seal. “May I have my Privileged check the\nauthenticity?”\n“By all means.”\n“Vivia!” Sulem called. The caramel-skinned Privileged arrived a\nmoment later and took the letter with a few words of instruction before\ndisappearing.\nTamas began to pace the tent, his mind racing. Royal seals always had\nthe faint touch of sorcery to them, much like a ward. It allowed generals in\nthe field to check for authenticity. Tamas had been able to sense it himself,\nbut Sulem needed to be convinced as well.\n“These are the words of a desperate man,” Sulem said. “You should be\npleased.”\n“He’s trying to buy time. He knows that we won’t advance into Kez\nwhile the snows fall.”\n“So what if he does? My armies have by now ravaged the Amber\nExpanse. They shall retreat to Alvation for the winter and sharpen their\nbayonets. Come spring we will crush whatever resistance the Kez have\nleft.”\nTamas paused in his pacing. He still did not want to explain to Sulem\nabout Kresimir and Ka-poel. Nor did he think that Sulem cared much for\nthe fact that a Brudanian army held Adopest. “He may be able to forge\nalliances. If Starland or Novi decides to enter the war on their side, this war\nwill last for ages.”\n“Novi wouldn’t dare,” Sulem said with a wave of his hand.\nOne flap of the tent parted as Vivia returned. She handed Sulem the\nletter. “It’s Ipille’s,” she said, and slipped back out the way she had come.\nTamas advanced to the table in the middle of Sulem’s tent and pushed\nseveral maps and correspondence out of the way, laying his own map of\nsouthern Adro down and rubbing it smooth. “I will not allow this war to last\nany longer.”\n“You have a plan?” Sulem approached the table curiously.\n“The Kez will likely gather here and prepare for our approach,” Tamas\nsaid, pointing to the northern entrance to Surkov’s Alley. “They’re less than\nhalf a day ahead of us. I propose that we march double-time into the night\ntonight and all day tomorrow and catch them unawares.”\nThe Kez king frowned at that. “You mean to stop them before they can\nsecure a defensive position at Surkov’s Alley?”\nTamas smiled. “I mean to do much more than that.”\nCHAPTER 36\nW\nhen Adamat told his carriage driver to take him to the Flerring Powder\nCompany on the west side of Adopest, he hadn’t expected them to head\nwell outside of the city and into the countryside."

    "text": "W\nhen Adamat told his carriage driver to take him to the Flerring Powder\nCompany on the west side of Adopest, he hadn’t expected them to head\nwell outside of the city and into the countryside.\nHe and SouSmith climbed out of their carriage at about three o’clock\nin the afternoon the day after their visit to Uskan and paused to examine\ntheir surroundings. The chemical company was at the end of a dirt track\nseveral miles off the main highway. It appeared to be a collection of over\ntwo dozen buildings of various sizes spread out at distant intervals across a\nwide field. A creek ran through the center of the complex, providing power\nto a single mill.\nNear the river, set apart from the rest of the buildings by some several\nhundred yards, Adamat noted a black smudge of dirt that looked like it had\nonce been the foundation for yet another building.\nThe perils of making gunpowder.\nAdamat headed toward the largest of the buildings.\nHe was stopped just outside the building by a woman holding a\nblunderbuss. She stood half a head taller than Adamat and had the shoulders\nof a boxer. Long brown hair half covered her eyes, and she leaned against\nthe building door. She pointed the weapon lazily at his feet.\n“Can I help you?”\nAdamat noticed the cudgel hanging from her belt and wondered if she\nwas the only guard. He didn’t think that likely. Companies like this needed\nmanpower to keep their secrets safe from competitors. “I’m looking for\nFlerring the Elder,” Adamat said.\n“Do you have an appointment?”\n“I don’t.”\n“What do you want?”\n“I need to discuss a matter of some urgency.”\n“And that is?”\n“I should probably speak with Flerring himself.”\nThe woman tilted her head to one side. “I’ll see if he’s available.\nWhom can I tell him is here?”\n“Inspector Adamat.”\n“You here from the state?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then go away until you’ve made an appointment. Or come back\nwhen you’ve got more goons. We’re not rolling over for your idiot\nregulations.”\nIdiot regulations? “You think I’m a government inspector?”\n“That’s what you just said.”\nAdamat let out a chuckle and smoothed the front of his jacket with one\nhand. “No, no. I’m not that kind of inspector. I’m investigating a murder\nattempt.”\n“And that knowledge is supposed to get you inside?” The woman\nlooked him over skeptically and raised the barrel of her blunderbuss by half\nan inch.\n“I think we got off on the wrong foot,” Adamat said, putting both\nhands out in a calming gesture. “I need to speak with Flerring about his\nblasting oil.”\nThe blunderbuss was raised until it was pointed at Adamat’s chest.\n“Well, then you’re definitely not coming in.”\nSouSmith stepped forward suddenly, putting himself between Adamat\nand the gun. “Lower the weapon,” he rumbled.\n“I don’t care how big you are, I don’t —”\n“Put. It. Down.” SouSmith took a step forward.\n“SouSmith, it’s okay, we don’t need to escalate this further.”\nThe woman suddenly lowered her blunderbuss. “Did you just say\nSouSmith? As in the boxer?”"

As in the boxer?”\n“That’s me.” The words came out of SouSmith in a growl. “Problem?”\nHer face split into a grin. “Uncle SouSmith! It’s me, Little Flerring.\nMy dad’s Flerring the Fist.”\nSouSmith’s fists slowly uncurled. “This is that Flerring?” He snorted.\n“You’re all grown up, Little.”\nShe grinned back at him. “Been, what, ten years? People grow up in\nthat time. I haven’t seen any of the old crew since Dad moved us out here to\nstart the powder company.”\n“Never took Flerring for a chemist,” SouSmith said.\n“Mom does most of the headwork. Dad does the mixing – well, he did\nanyway. Lost both his hands in an explosion two years ago. He oversees a\ndozen mixers now and runs the place while Mom is in Fatrasta.”\nAdamat stepped up beside SouSmith and leaned on his cane. “Do you\nthink we could see your father?”\n“You’re not bringing us trouble, are you, SouSmith?”\nSouSmith looked at Adamat, and Adamat drummed his fingers on his\ncane. Impossible to tell. If Flerring made the blasting oil, he could very well\nbe complicit in the attempt on Ricard’s life. Not that they had to know that.\nAdamat shook his head. “Just chasing a lead. You probably won’t hear from\nus after today.”\nFlerring gave a nod and opened one of the double doors that led into\nthe building. “Careful what you touch,” she said, “We don’t keep a lot of\npowder in the main building, but you can never be too careful.”\nThey entered what looked to have once been an immense stable\ncapable of housing almost a hundred head of horses. The stalls were filled\nwith raw materials, their doors marked in white chalk telling what was\nstored inside. They passed dozens of them filled with barrels and boxes of\nsulfur, saltpeter, charcoal, glycerol, nitric acid. Everything was packed in\nsawdust and straw, which was strewn all about the place.\n“This looks incredibly unsafe,” Adamat commented.\n“We keep everything separate,” Little Flerring said. “None of the\ningredients are particularly dangerous on their own.”\n“Lots of straw. Seems an immense fire risk.”\n“No flames allowed within fifty feet of the building. We do all our\nwork during the light of the day.”\nAdamat noticed she had left her blunderbuss outside. It did seem they\nwere quite careful. “What can you tell me about blasting oil?”\n“I’ll let Dad do that,” she said, pausing beside one of the stalls. She\ngestured inside to a makeshift office.\nAn old man sat at an all-too-small desk in one corner. He was bent\nover with age, his hair gone gray, but he still had shoulders half a hand\nwider than SouSmith’s. The outer-stall wall had been given a large window,\nand the man hunched over a book.

One\nhad a dual hook for grasping, and the other a flat piece of steel in the shape\nof a paddle.\n“Dad, you’ve got guests,” Little Flerring shouted. “Dad!” She gave\nSouSmith and Adamat an apologetic look. “He’s very hard of hearing.”\n“Eh?” The big man turned toward them. At the sight of strangers he\ngot to his feet, and Adamat almost took a step back. Flerring the Elder –\nFlerring the Fist – was immense. He towered over Adamat and made even\nSouSmith look regular-sized. The left side of his face was burned and\nscarred, making it look lopsided when he smiled. “Is that SouSmith?” he\nasked loudly.\n“Fist,” SouSmith said, nodding.\n“Fist?” Flerring shook his handless arms at SouSmith. “Not so much\nanymore.” He gave a long, almost mechanical chortle.\nThe two big men made their greetings and Adamat introduced himself.\nFlerring the Elder led the whole group around the corner to part of the barn\nwhere the stalls had been removed and a comfortable sitting area installed,\nincluding several sofas, armchairs, and the entrance to an ice cellar, into\nwhich Little Flerring disappeared, only to emerge a moment later with a\nbottle. She poured them all chilled wine while her father talked.\n“Blasting oil,” the big man said, shaking his head. “It was our first big\ndiscovery. We’ve done well over the years, creating specialized powder for\nthe Adran army and the Brudania-Gurla Trading Company, but blasting oil\nwas going to make us stupid rich.”\nAdamat sat up at the mention of Claremonte’s company. “You do\nbusiness with the Trading Company?”\n“Everyone does,” Flerring said. “And you’re naïve to think they don’t.\nThe company is our biggest source of saltpeter. We have other sources, of\ncourse, but they control just about all the import business. Where was I?\nOh, yes. Blasting oil.”\n“Can you tell me about it?”\n“Eh?”\nAdamat repeated his question loudly.\n“It’s a liquid mix of…” – Flerring paused – “Well, I’m not gonna give\nout trade secrets.”\n“I understand,” Adamat said sympathetically. “What can you tell me\nwithout giving up too much? Does it explode similarly to gunpowder?”\n“It’s a high-velocity explosive. Far more destructive than gunpowder.\nIt doesn’t take much, either. A glass ball or tube of the stuff no bigger than\nmy stub here” – Flerring wagged one arm – “is enough to crack stone. We\nplanned on revolutionizing the mining industry with it. Just didn’t work out\nin the end.”\nIt didn’t take an inspector to see an awfully significant gap between\n“going to make us rich” and “didn’t work out.” “What happened?” Adamat\nasked.\n“We had a chemist named Borin on our payroll,” Flerring said. “Nice\nlad, very smart. I’d thought about trying to marry him to Little here.”"

I’d thought about trying to marry him to Little here.”\nLittle Flerring made a face as she handed her father a wineglass. “That\nwouldn’t have happened, Dad, and you know it.”\n“Thought about it, is all I said, hon.” He hooked the wineglass deftly\nand took a sip. “Anyway, Borin came up with the blasting-oil recipe about\ntwo years ago. Spent every waking moment since working to stabilize it. It\nwas too volatile, you see. Killed two of our mixers in an accident early on.\nIt explodes by shock rather than by flame, which makes it damn near\nimpossible to transport.”\nShock. Now that was an interesting tidbit. Adamat thought about his\ntheory that the explosives had been thrown into Ricard’s headquarters. “So\nyou haven’t sold any?”\n“Of course not! You think I’m in the business of blowing up my\ncustomers? I’ve learned my lesson with explosives.” Flerring gestured to\nhis scarred face with the metal paddle fixed to his left hand. “That’s why we\nfired Borin, actually. He wanted to see the blasting oil put to practical use,\nso he sold a couple samples to a mining company.”\n“So he did sell it!”\n“Yeah. Little found out, and we agreed we couldn’t trust him anymore.\nWe drew up a contract that let us keep a percentage of the profits if he\nwound up selling the formula to another company and we parted on good\nterms. That was only about two weeks ago.”\nAdamat was on the edge of his seat now. He had something solid.\nSomeplace to take this investigation. If Borin still had his formula and had\nsold it to Ricard’s attempted murderers, he could track them down. “Can\nyou point me to him? I need to speak with Borin.”\nFlerring exchanged a glance with his daughter. “He’s over there,” he\nsaid, waving his hook vaguely to his right. “And over there. And there.”\nLittle Flerring chuckled in an exasperated manner. “That’s unkind,\nDad.”\n“Look, I tell all my mixers and chemists that if they blow themselves\nup, it’s their own damn fault.”\n“Don’t make sport out of the dead, Dad.”\nAdamat felt his heart fall. “Borin’s dead?”\n“Very. About as dead as a man can be this side of angering a\nPrivileged. Best as we can guess, he was packing up his samples of blasting\noil and dropped one at his foot. You might have seen that grease spot over\nby the river on your way in?”\n“Yes.”\n“That used to be a very sturdy stone building. It’s where our chemists\nworked. That building was built to survive any size explosion. It could have\nlasted through an artillery bombardment. Took out Borin and all of our\nongoing experiments. There weren’t even pieces of Borin left after that, and\nwe’re still finding bits of stone everywhere we walk.”\nAdamat leaned back in his seat and let out a sigh. “I’m sorry for your\nloss.”\nFlerring shrugged. “It set us back, but our people keep good notes.

It\ndestroyed every bit of the blasting oil we had left, which I think is a damned\nblessing.”\n“Dad…”\n“Don’t you ‘Dad’ me.” Flerring shook his head at his daughter and\nturned to Adamat. “I’ve put a stop to all research on the blasting oil. Burned\nall but one copy of the notes, and only I know where the last copy is.\nInfernal stuff isn’t going to get us all killed while I’m still alive. Once I’m\ndead, my girl here is welcome to blow herself up as quick as she wants. But\nnot before that.”\nA dead end. Dead as Borin. There was no way to know if Flerring was\ntelling the truth about any of this without the chemist to corroborate. Maybe\nFlerring killed Borin to cover his tracks. Adamat could bring in a dozen\nofficers and tear the place apart, but that was the last thing he had time for.\nAnd SouSmith might not forgive him.\n“Do you happen to know who Borin sold the stuff to?”\nFlerring scratched his head with his hook. “A mining company. Do\nyou know, hon?”\n“There’s a receipt somewhere,” Little Flerring said. “I’ll see if I can\nfind it.”\nShe disappeared for a few minutes, during which time Flerring and\nSouSmith talked about their boxing days. Adamat couldn’t help but be\namazed at how vigorous the boxer-turned-powder-maker was, despite his\ninjuries.\nHis daughter returned holding a scrap of paper and handed it to\nAdamat. “The Underhill Mining Coalition,” she said.\nAdamat paused as he reached for the paper and let his hand fall. “You\nsure?”\n“Yes.”\n“I’ll remember it, thank you.”\nLittle Flerring shrugged and put the paper in her pocket.\n“This mining company. You didn’t happen to meet their representative,\ndid you?” Adamat felt his heart begin to race.\n“No. Borin did business with them behind our back. We wouldn’t have\nagreed to the sale otherwise.”\n“Did Borin happen to tell you why they needed it?”\n“They were looking for high-powered explosives,” Little Flerring said\nas if it were obvious.\nThis wasn’t helping at all. “But did they come to him or did he go to\nthem?”\n“Oh. They came to him.”\n“That’s all we need to know. Thank you,” Adamat said, getting to his\nfeet. “I think it’s time we go. I appreciate your help a great deal.”\n“Didn’t think we were much help,” Little Flerring said. “If you track\ndown the samples Borin sold, let me know. I’d prefer they were destroyed.”\n“You were a great deal of help. And don’t worry, I’ll tell you.” Adamat\nshook hands with Little Flerring, then tentatively grasped the Fist’s offered\nhook. A few minutes later and he and SouSmith were back in their carriage\nheaded toward Adopest.\n“Good to see him,” SouSmith rumbled.\nAdamat barely heard him, deep in thought. “Yes, I’m sure.”\n“Been a long time.

You thinking of settling down, SouSmith?”\nSouSmith chuckled. “Too young for me.” He paused. Then, “Why\nsuch a hurry?”\nAdamat drummed his fingers on the head of his cane excitedly.\n“Because the Underhill Mining Coalition isn’t a mining company,” he said.\n“Don’t follow.”\n“They’re a club. A group of thieves and smugglers who call\nthemselves businessmen. They meet to drink and play cards at an exclusive\n– and hidden – location in Adopest. Most people know them as the\nUnderhill Society and I happen to be friends with one of their members.”\n“Who’s that?”\n“Ricard Tumblar.”\nNila and Olem hunted the Kez cavalry through the gorges and hills of\nBrude’s Hideaway for three days. On the first day a low cloud cover\ndescended over the area, obscuring the peaks of the Charwood Pile to the\nwest, and on the second day a heavy fog rolled in. Nila wondered if the fog\nhad some kind of sorcery behind it, but neither she nor Olem could sense\nanything amiss in the Else.\nIt was just bad luck.\nNila couldn’t see the ends of their cuirassier lines as they swept the\nridges and bends of the highlands. The sun was obscured and the whole\nworld seemed gray.\nShe stood in her stirrups the third day, wondering how any man or\nwoman could possibly stay in the saddle for hours at a time, let alone\nseveral days. Everything below her waist hurt, and most of the things above\nit. Her knuckles were sore from gripping the reins and her spine ached from\nthe jolt of her horse’s stride. Her head spun from hour after hour of trying to\nmaintain her vision of the Else, attempting to spot anything in the fog. Olem\ntold her to drink more water.\nOlem sat beside her at the top of a small hill looking to the south – or\nmaybe the north, she couldn’t really be sure, with no point of reference.\nThere was a white chasm at their feet where the earth dipped beneath the\nfog, and she couldn’t tell if this was merely a divot in the landscape or a\nvalley a mile long.\n“The good news,” Olem said, puffing on a cigarette, “is that the fog\nscrews with them as much as it does with us. They’re left reading the\nground and listening for echoes in the murk, same as us.”\nNila sniffed. He’d become progressively more optimistic as the hours\nrolled past. He seemed to hold the opinion that every minute they spent\ncircling the Gurlish Wolf in the fog was another minute he wasn’t abusing\nthe flanks of Tamas’s army. Which, she supposed, was true, if the Gurlish\nWolf hadn’t slipped past them and was back on the plain already, attacking\nthe Adran army.\n“They have an advantage over us,” Nila said.\n“Oh?”\n“They can smell your cigarette smoke from farther away than we can\nsee them.”\nOlem took the cigarette from his mouth and stared at it sourly before"

I haven’t heard a trumpet since the fog descended, so\nit’s not that.”\n“Maybe they have a Knacked?”\n“Maybe,” Olem mused. “Someone with very precise hearing. A few\nyears back I heard a story about a pair of Knacked twins that could\ncommunicate over a hundred miles just using their minds. That kind of\nthing is rarer than a Privileged healer, I’d imagine.” He drew his tobacco\nand rolling papers from his breast pocket, stared at them for a moment, then\nput them back with a sigh. “No, I imagine they’ve done the smart thing and\nhunkered down in one of these valleys to wait out the fog.”\nNila studied the ground beneath their feet, looking at the horseshoe\nprints in the mud – horseshoes marked by a Kez blacksmith. The tracks led\ninto the gully below them. The Kez had split up after being run from their\ncamp three days before. Their tracks seemed to lead everywhere,\ncrisscrossing and doubling back without any clear path to follow.\nAnd like a hound looking for a scent, Olem had patiently been\nfollowing every one of those trails. He kept his formations tight, his scouts\nplentiful, and never stumbled blindly into one of the fog-concealed valleys.\nIt all seemed very professional to Nila, but she wouldn’t have had any\nidea as to any of this if Olem hadn’t been explaining it to her along the way.\n“You’re picking this stuff up quickly,” Olem said.\n“What stuff?”\n“All this.” He tapped the pocket where he kept his tobacco. “Cigarette\nsmoke. Something I didn’t think of, but a Kez cavalryman would. Good\ncall.”\nNila ducked her head. “Thank you.”\n“A fighting Privileged,” Olem said. “Six months ago, if I had to guess\nwhat extraordinary thing you’d become, I would not have guessed that.”\nNila knew it was meant to be a compliment, but it niggled at her all the\nsame. “You don’t think I’m capable?”\n“You’ve shown yourself to be capable.”\n“But you wouldn’t have thought that.”\n“That’s not quite what I meant.”\n“And what did you mean, Colonel Olem?”\nOlem removed the rolling paper from his pocket and was about to\nsprinkle tobacco on the center before he made a face and put it back.\n“Privileged are born to it. You were a laundress. No offense, but it didn’t\nseem like something on your horizon.”\nNila opened her mouth, ready to take the argument further, then\ndecided against it. What was she doing, arguing like this? Olem was right,\nof course. A Privileged? Her? It was laughably unlikely.\n“If you don’t mind me saying,” Olem said, “you’ve been on edge.\nMore than just a chafed ass.”"

It was laughably unlikely.\n“If you don’t mind me saying,” Olem said, “you’ve been on edge.\nMore than just a chafed ass.”\nNila let out what she had wanted to be a dismissive laugh, but it came\nout as just this side of hysterical. “You could say that.”\n“The field marshal has a habit of using the hottest fire to temper soft\nmetal,” Olem said. “I’m not sure if he should have sent you.”\n“I’m soft metal, am I? No. It’s not that. Well. It is that. But so many\nmore things. I’ve never ridden before and my body hurts so badly I want to\ncry every moment. I’m untested, barely trained. This infernal fog!” Her\nvoice rose a little too high and a nearby cuirassier glanced at her.\nOlem sat unmoved, listening for several moments before he said, “At\nleast you know your failings.”\n“Oh, thanks.”\n“Really. I mean it. I’ve met dozens of officers who think their\nimmaculate mustache can move the world. Not knowing one’s weaknesses\ngets people killed.”\nNila shook her head and gave a short laugh, relieved to hear this one\nsounding a little less desperate. “Little do they know that an immaculate\nbeard is what it takes.”\nOlem grinned at her. “Right you are.” His hand was halfway toward\nhis rolling papers again before he swore under his breath.\n“Are you with anyone?” Nila asked, the question leaving her lips\nbefore she could stop herself.\nOlem glanced up in surprise. “Huh? Well…” He rubbed the back of his\nneck. “Kind of. It’s a tenuous thing.”\nNila was surprised to find herself hurt by his answer. She had turned\nhim down, after all, and that was months ago. Maybe she had hoped he\nwould pine for her a little longer. “Another soldier?”\n“Yeah.”\n“What’s she like?”\n“Long legs. Black hair. Very good at what she does.”\n“Oh? And what does she do?” She felt a smile tug at the corner of her\nmouth when Olem’s cheeks turned red.\n“She’s a powder mage.”\nNila gave a low whistle. “You don’t settle, do you?”\n“Never have,” Olem said, giving her a lingering glance. She opened\nher mouth, but forgot her response immediately when Olem held up a hand.\n“Do you hear that?” he whispered.\nUp and down the line, cuirassiers grew alert. Nila strained her ears to\nlisten, but couldn’t hear anything. “What is it?”\nOlem put one hand on the stock of his carbine. “I thought I heard a\nhorse down there.”\nThey remained in silence for several minutes, during which Nila barely\nallowed herself to breathe. The fear and anxiety all returned in those\nprecious minutes of waiting, and she could feel her heart hammering\nagainst her chest like a bird trying to escape its cage.\nA shadow appeared in the fog down in the gully. Nila thought her heart\nwould burst at any moment, until she saw Olem relax, his finger edging\naway from the trigger of his carbine.\n“It’s one of ours,” a cuirassier said. “Looks like Ganley.”"

    "text": "would burst at any moment, until she saw Olem relax, his finger edging\naway from the trigger of his carbine.\n“It’s one of ours,” a cuirassier said. “Looks like Ganley.”\nA horse came out of the fog carrying a blue-uniformed rider. Olem\ncalled out a greeting, and Nila sat back in her saddle, trying to find a\ncomfortable spot on which to sit. There wasn’t one. She closed her eyes,\ntrying to reach the meditative state that Bo had taught her – a place between\nthis world and the Else, where she could let her worries fade.\nShe had yet to reach it.\nWhen her eyes opened again, she found that she’d slipped past her\ntarget and gone into the Else – here at least, she sighed to herself, the fog\ncouldn’t penetrate. The hills rolled on in the distance, and she could see that\nthe gully before them was indeed a deep one, extending thirty feet down\nand on into thick brush in the distance. Hundreds of small flames danced\nbefore her eyes like fireflies.\nSeveral things happened at once. First, she screamed. Second, the\nreturning scout, Ganley, fell from his horse, his bloody throat grinning up at\nthem all from the ground, and third, those hundreds of fireflies suddenly\nshot forward and the rumble of hooves brought Nila out of the Else and into\nthe real world, where horses seemed to erupt from the mist, ridden by Kez\ncavalry in their green-on-tan uniforms.\nOlem’s carbine went off, causing a ringing in Nila’s ears. A dozen\nother shots were fired before the Kez cavalry were suddenly upon them.\nNila felt a Kez mount ram her own, sending the creature reeling to the\nside. She sawed at the reins and nearly fell out of her saddle, when a sword\nflashed in front of her eyes. The cuff of a blue uniform sprang into her\nvision as Olem countered a stroke meant for her neck. She heard him grunt,\nswear, then he was gone.\nA Kez dragoon leaned into Nila from the side, and she’d barely got her\nhands up before the guard of his saber cracked into the side of her head.\nVision swimming, she latched onto the man’s arm, pulling him closer, and\nput her fingers around his throat.\nShe willed the fire from the Else, pouring her anger and energy in\nbehind it, and waited for the man’s head to wither like a burned mushroom.\nNothing happened.\nPanic seized her. She pushed herself closer to the dragoon, feeling his\nbreath upon her neck, grasping for the Else. It was still there, she could still\nsense it at her fingertips, but nothing was happening.\nThe guard of his saber hit her again. She reeled, unable to grasp her\nsorcery, yet knowing if she let go, she would die with a split head. She dug\nher fingernails into his throat and tore. The man suddenly disengaged,\ncursing angrily in Kez and holding his bloody throat.\nNila remembered the pistol Olem had given her. She grasped for the\nbutt, her hands shaking, and leveled it at the dragoon.\nA grin flashed across his face, and the last thing she felt was a tug on\nthe back of her head and the whole world going upside down.\nCHAPTER 37"

What the pit is going on here, Ricard? I thought\nyou wanted me working quickly.”\nAdamat came up short. Ricard sat slumped behind his desk, hair\nfrayed, jacket discarded in one corner, a pair of reading glasses perched on\nhis nose and a newspaper in one hand.\n“Pit,” Adamat said. “It looks like you haven’t slept in three days.”\nRicard stifled a yawn. “Five, I think. Well. I’ve caught some naps.\nHere and there. Fell,” he shouted.\n“Right here, sir.” Adamat exchanged a glance with Fell, who was\nstanding right beside him.\nRicard squinted over his glasses. “So you are. Fell, tell the boys out\nfront to let Adamat in to see me immediately no matter what.”\nFell cleared her throat. “No matter what, sir?”\n“Unless I’m indisposed. Kresimir’s balls, that’s obvious. Look,\nAdamat, I’m sorry. I’ve quadrupled the security since the bombing, and you\nknow how it is with logistics like this. Orders get crossed, people can’t see\nme. It’s a nightmare. You should have just come by my home.”\n“I did. Several times. You weren’t there.”\n“Sir,” Fell said. “You haven’t left this office for two days. You haven’t\nbeen home since before the bombing.”\nRicard scratched his head. “That’s right. Oh well. Wine?”\n“It’s nine o’clock in the morning.” Adamat took a seat opposite Ricard.\n“Coffee?”\n“Yes, please.”\n“Fell, have someone get us coffee. And put a little whiskey in mine.”\n“That’s awful, Ricard,” Adamat said.\n“I’ve had worse.” Ricard hiccupped and pounded twice on his chest\nwith one fist. “Now then, what can you tell me about the bombing?”\n“The bombing was done with something called ‘blasting oil,’ ”\nAdamat said. “It took some time, but I was able to track down the\nmanufacturer.”\n“Who was it?”\n“The Flerring Powder Company.”\n“Never heard of them,” Ricard growled. “And when I’m done with\nthem, no one ever will. I’ll see them out of business! I’ll destroy everything\nthey —”\nAdamat cut him off. “That’s quite unnecessary.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I interviewed the owner and his daughter. The blasting oil wasn’t\nready for sale. It’s too unstable. One of their chemists sold a sample of it\nbehind their backs and they canned him for it.”\n“I see. This chemist?”\n“Blew himself up the day after they fired him.”\n“Convenient.”\n“Perhaps. Whether it was an accident or not, Flerring insisted that he\nwouldn’t have sold the stuff himself, and I believe him.”\n“Where does that leave us? The owner claiming innocence and the\nchemist dead? I don’t like it.”"

I don’t like it.”\n“They told me who their chemist sold the sample to.”\nA young man entered the room carrying a silver platter with two cups\nand a pot of coffee. When the drinks were served and the man had left,\nRicard leaned forward. “Who bought it?”\n“The Underhill Mining Coalition.”\nRicard made a strangled noise and spit some of his coffee out down the\nfront of his shirt. “Pardon?”\n“The Underhill Mining Coalition,” Adamat repeated. “Which, if my\nmemory serves, is a front for the Underhill Society. The name they use\nwhen one of the members wants to buy something with funds that can’t be\neasily traced.”\n“If memory serves.” Ricard scrunched up his face and mimicked\nAdamat in a high voice. “Bloody Knacked and your bloody memory. You\ncan’t be certain.”\n“It’s the only lead I have.”\n“Perhaps you got the explosive wrong. Maybe it was something else.”\n“I put the time to good use while I was waiting for my appointment\nwith Fell,” Adamat said, removing a paper from his pocket. “I employed\nFlerring the Younger, the heir to the Flerring Powder Company, as an expert\nin my investigation. She examined the union headquarters and has given me\nwritten evidence that the explosion was indeed caused by blasting oil, and\nthat the oil was purchased by the Underhill Mining Coalition.”\n“How the pit did you get her to sign that?”\nAdamat coughed into his hand. “I swore that we wouldn’t prosecute\nher or her company.”\n“You’re a bastard.”\n“If we need a scapegoat, the dead chemist is as good as any. But we\ndon’t need a scapegoat. We just need the location of the Underhill Society.”\nRicard sprang to his feet. “Absolutely not.”\n“Why is that?”\n“What’s the point of a secret society if it’s not secret anymore?”\n“They tried to kill you.”\n“They? More likely just one or two of the members.” Ricard cursed\nunder his breath. “I rose up through their ranks. I’ve been friends with those\nmen and women for the last twenty years. I’ve given every one of them\ngood jobs, business opportunities. Pit, I’ve kept three of them out of jail.”\n“How many members are there?”\n“There are —” Ricard’s mouth snapped shut. “I’m not supposed to talk\nabout it at all. Secret society, remember?”\n“I think they waived their right to secrecy when they decided to use the\nsociety as their front while trying to kill you. Are any of them particularly\nstupid?”\n“It’s not as stupid as you think. Less than fifty people in Adopest even\nknow that the Underhill Society exists. Giving the name to some small\npowder company means absolutely nothing, and let’s be honest – we only\nknow it was this blasting oil because of you. The police didn’t notice\nanything different about the explosion.” Ricard slumped back in his chair\nand drained his cup of coffee. He bent over suddenly, his face twisted in a\ngrimace.\n“Are you all right?”\n“That coffee was really hot.” Ricard recovered and went on. “I can’t"

I can’t betray them like this.”\n“They betrayed you.”\n“One or two of them. Maybe! Pit.”\n“I understand this is hard for you, Ricard.” Adamat leaned across the\ndesk. “They’ll try again, though.”\n“How can you be certain? You said they only had a sample.”\n“After examining the union headquarters, Flerring the Younger said\nshe thought two explosions weren’t big enough for them to have used all\nthe blasting oil. They may still have enough blasting oil to make several\nmore bombs.”\n“Well, pit.”\n“If you can give me the names of one or two of the society members\nyou suspect, I can trail them. I would need some men to help me, but we\nmight be able to find out where they keep the blasting oil or their next\ntarget.”\n“I know where they’re keeping it,” Ricard said miserably.\n“Where?”\n“At the Society building.”\n“They’re keeping an unstable explosive at the Underhill Society? How\nstupid are they?”\n“Not as stupid as you think.”\n“You have to tell me where it is.”\nInstead, Ricard turned and shouted for Fell. When she appeared at the\ndoor, he said, “Get together five of my most discreet men.”\n“When?”\n“As quickly as possible. Within the hour.”\n“Yes sir. What is it for, sir?”\n“We have to search the basement of this building for a powerful\nexplosive.”\nAdamat was astonished at how quickly Fell prepared the operation.\nAt Fell’s insistence, Ricard left the building – ostensibly to meet\nCheris for an early lunch – and several of his most valuable lieutenants\nwere suddenly called away. Within thirty minutes, two men and three\nwomen had gathered in an empty hotel room. Adamat could only assume\nthey were union members who had earned Ricard’s trust but not yet been\ngiven any duties of importance.\nAdamat stood near the window of the hotel room. Two of the women\nsat on the bed, and a third near the door, while both men had their backs to\nthe wall. Everyone watched intently as Fell entered the room and closed the\ndoor behind her.\nShe began quietly, “What we say at this meeting does not leave this\nroom, understand?”\nThe gathered group exchanged looks before giving their unanimous\nconsent. Some of them glanced at Adamat and he wondered if any of them\nknew who he was. He recognized three of the faces by happenstance, but\ndidn’t know any of their names.\n“There is a strong chance that someone has placed a bomb beneath this\nbuilding,” Fell said. To their credit, none of them headed for the door. “The\nperpetrator does not know that we know, and we are going to search the\npremises quickly and quietly until we find it. We will start with the\nbasement and work our way up. Before any of you ask, this is not a\nvolunteer assignment. If one of you leaves the building before I say so, you\nwill never find work in this country again.”\nAdamat noted that one of the men had started to sweat violently. Fear?\nOr guilt? The woman by the door swallowed hard."

The woman by the door swallowed hard.\n“That being said,” Fell went on, letting a smile touch her lips, “once\nwe find and dispose of the bomb, each of you will find yourself well\nrewarded. You’ll receive promotions within the union and a not-\ninsignificant amount of money. Inspector Adamat and I will lead the search.\nQuestions? Yes, Draily?”\nThe woman by the door lowered her hand. “I don’t know a damn thing\nabout bombs. How am I going to help with all this?”\nAdamat cut in before Fell could respond. “No one knows anything\nabout this kind of bomb,” he said. “It’s not gunpowder, but something\ncalled blasting oil. It does not respond to flame but rather to concussion,\nwhich means that our search needs to be very, very careful. Handle\neverything gently and, for Adom’s sake, do not drop anything!”\n“Then what the pit are we looking for?” the sweating man asked, his\nvoice strained.\n“I don’t know,” Adamat admitted. “A container of some sort. The\nblasting oil was sold in ten clear glass vials, stoppered at the top with corks.\nOur suspect may have transferred the oil to a new container, or it may still\nbe in those same vials. We’ll make a thorough examination of any liquid on\nthe premises.”\n“Does this have anything to do with the bombing at the union\nheadquarters?” one of the women on the bed asked.\n“Possibly,” Adamat said. They didn’t need to know anything more\nthan that. “Any other questions?”\nA round of headshaking.\n“Good,” Fell said. “And again, be damned careful! If you find\nanything suspicious, let Inspector Adamat know immediately. Don’t make a\nscene. We want to do this as quietly as possible. Now, everyone to the\nbasement.”\nAdamat stepped over to Fell as they all filed out of the room. “The\nbrunette,” Adamat said.\n“Little Will?”\n“Yes. Something about all this was making him nervous as pit. Grab\nhim and put him under guard.”\nFell gave a quick affirmative and left the room quickly after Will.\nAdamat passed them in the hall, Fell with her hand on Will’s shoulder and\nWill’s collar soaked with sweat. Adamat followed the rest of the group\ndown to the cellar. Lanterns were handed out quickly, and voices talked in\nhushed tones. Adamat held his lantern high and gripped his cane tightly. A\ntingle went down his spine as he descended into the damp stone basement.\nThe four union workers looked to him when they reached the bottom,\nand he realized that Fell had not yet come down. He was seized by sudden\nsuspicion. If even one of them was in on this bomb plot, they might make a\ngo at him. He found himself sizing each of them up, planning the best way\nto defend himself.\nA few moments passed before he realized they were still watching\nhim.\n“Well, get to it.”\n“Uh, sir,” Draily said. “Look.”\nAdamat shook the fear from his head and stepped forward.

    "text": "“Uh, sir,” Draily said. “Look.”\nAdamat shook the fear from his head and stepped forward. They stood\nin a long, arched hallway with walls of stone, and off the hallway to the\nright were a dozen niches that extended out beneath the hotel. At the far end\nof the hall was a low, heavy door.\nDraily was pointing into the first niche. Adamat held his lantern inside\nand squinted. “Nothing but wine,” he said.\nShe rolled her eyes. “Is it?”\n“Oh.” Realization set in. Of course. Any of these wine bottles could be\nthe bomb or bombs he was looking for. It would be the best place to hide\nsomething like that – in plain sight. Adamat tapped his fingers on his\nstomach, then said, “Search everything else. I’ll check the wine.”\nThe rest of the group moved on to the other niches, and Adamat began\nto inspect the wine. At first glance he estimated upward of two thousand\nbottles here, and Adamat wondered if this was the other part of Ricard’s\nwine collection or whether the hotel was just this well stocked.\nAdamat removed his jacket and hung it from a peg on the wall, rolling\nhis sleeves up. He began examining each wine bottle, starting at the top\nrow. They came in every variety; some were slender, dark-brown bottles,\nwhile others were fat green bottles with long necks.\nHe looked for consistency; the thickness of the dust, how the labels\nwere positioned, as well as the size and shape of the bottle itself. He felt a\ngrowing despair as he went – if the blasting oil had been hidden inside a\nwine bottle, it might be impossible to find. A hotel such as this went\nthrough wine at an alarming rate. Some of the bottles had been here for\nmonths or years, and those were easy to tell from the layer of dust, but there\nwere still at least eighty bottles that had been handled recently.\n“You think our bomber is that devious?” Fell’s voice said from the\nhallway.\nAdamat didn’t look up from his examination. “They’d have to be an\nidiot not to see the opportunity,” Adamat said. “I don’t know how to go\nabout this without opening four dozen bottles to check their contents.”\n“A last resort, I think,” Fell said. “You know how Ricard is about his\nwine.”\n“Would he rather drink a glass of blasting oil?”\n“I’ll have to point that out to him.” She paused, then, “You’re certain\nit’s here?”\n“Ricard was certain,” Adamat said. “That’s all I have to go on.”\n“He may be wrong.”\n“A possibility, sure,” Adamat said. “But if he’s right…”\n“Not worth the risk. That man you pointed out, Will?”\n“Anything?” Adamat stopped his search long enough to look hopefully\ntoward Fell. If they’d just happened upon a conspirator, they might get a\nlucky break. Investigative science practically depended on lucky breaks.\n“Just nervous,” Fell said. “His father worked for a powder company\nand was killed in a blast two years ago. Will’s terrified of explosions. I\nshould have remembered it earlier. Poor man pissed himself when I\nwouldn’t let him leave the building.”\nAdamat returned his attention to the wine bottles. “A pity.”"

Poor man pissed himself when I\nwouldn’t let him leave the building.”\nAdamat returned his attention to the wine bottles. “A pity.”\nHe heard a jingle of keys, and Fell said, “Mark where you are and\ncome with me. I’ll set a man to make sure the wine isn’t disturbed. We need\nto search the Underhill Room.”\n“Oh?” Adamat made a mental note of the wine cellar and followed\nFell down the hallway to the thick door at the end of the basement. She\nunlocked it and pulled it open, the strain of her shoulders testifying to the\nweight.\nInside, Adamat was surprised to find another long corridor. He held his\nlantern high and glanced back at Fell.\n“Go on.”\nHe crept down the hall slowly, still clutching his cane, and he\nwondered briefly how much he trusted Fell. Her loyalty was supposed to be\nto Ricard for the duration of her contract. But what if that was all a lie?\nCould she have planned the bombing? She could kill him down here\nwithout a problem, then hide the body and tell Ricard he had left. Adamat’s\nmind whirred through a dozen possible motives and all the reasons why he\nwas wrong. By the time he reached the end of the hall, he was no less wary,\nand all the more certain that he wouldn’t stand even the faintest chance\nagainst Fell in a fight.\nHis lantern created eerie shadows in the large, square room at the end\nof the hall. Fell squeezed past him to light candelabras along all four walls\nuntil the entire room had been illuminated. It looked like any of the\nhundreds of gentleman’s clubs in Adopest – the walls were covered in\nvelvet and the candelabras were polished brass. There was seating for at\nleast a dozen people in the form of divans and couches, and the center of\nthe room held a velvet-lined card table with room for six.\nThere was a dumbwaiter in one corner, likely leading up to the kitchen,\nand a smaller, private stock of wine as well as an untapped keg. A fireplace\nsat at either end of the room, though upon closer examination they appeared\nto be wood-burning stoves with stone façades.\n“So this is the Underhill Society?”\nFell finished lighting the candelabras and blew out her lantern. “Yes.”\n“Has it been here the whole time?” Adamat remembered hearing about\nthe Underhill Society for the first time over thirteen years ago and knew it\nwas much older than that. Ricard had owned the hotel for only six.\n“Only since Ricard bought the hotel. He hasn’t told me where they met\nbefore that.”\nAdamat pointed back down the hallway. “Are they…”\n“They can come search the room. It shouldn’t take long. Just don’t\nmention the… well, you know.”\nFell’s searchers finished their assigned niches and then moved into the\nlarger room, checked every nook and cranny thoroughly and without\ncomment as to the room’s purpose. Adamat returned to the wine cellar,\nresuming his examination of the bottles.\nFrustration continued to mount. Every bit of instinct told him that the\nblasting oil should be hidden among the wine.

It was too good a spot for\nany henchman with half a wit, and if the perpetrator had a whole wit, the oil\nwould have been bottled carefully and put in among the less-used wines.\nAdamat cursed under his breath and tried to recall the latest fashionable\nwines among Ricard’s friends and associates – those would be the easiest to\nrule out.\nThe searchers moved up to the next floor, and Adamat only barely\nnoted their passing.\nIt must have been almost an hour later when he heard someone on the\nbasement stairs. He noted Fell’s soft footfalls.\n“Any progress upstairs?” he asked.\nFell set her lantern on a wine barrel in one corner. “None. It’s a large\nhotel and with only four men it’s a slow business. Progress here?”\n“I’ve narrowed it down to a possibility of three dozen bottles,” Adamat\nsaid.\n“Are you sure you’re putting your energy in the right place? After all,\nI’d think it would be obvious if any of the wine here had been uncorked.”\n“Certainly. But they could have done it off-site and brought the wine\nhere.” Adamat sighed and returned a bottle to its place. “I should have\nasked Ricard if any of his guests have brought him new wine recently.”\n“Everyone does,” Fell said.\nAdamat eyed the shelves where he’d sorted the most probable bottles.\n“Have him make a list for me. The only way to know for certain is to open\nevery bottle. Or, more safely, to take the whole lot out of the city and throw\nit off a high cliff.”\n“Ricard would be… cross. He already lost his collection beneath the\nold headquarters. You know how he feels about his wine.”\n“The captain of the hotel will already gut me for destroying whatever\nsystem he had in place down here. Might as well infuriate Ricard as well.\nGet someone to help me carry these upstairs.” He rubbed at his temples.\n“Pit, how am I going to get this out of the city? From everything Flerring\ntold me, it’s a terrible idea to transport the stuff by carriage. Too bumpy.”\n“Ma’am?” a voice called down the basement stairs.\nFell stepped into the basement hall and called back. “Yes?”\n“I think we’ve found something.”\nAdamat was on his feet in moments. He followed Fell up the stairs,\nwhere Draily waited. The woman led them both into the kitchen and\nstopped beside the silver cabinet. “Had to get the captain to open it up for\nme.” She opened one of the doors and knelt in front of it. “You’ll want to\nlook yourselves. I don’t really want to reach in there.”\nAdamat lay on the wood floor beside the silver cabinet and took Fell’s\nlantern.\nOn the bottom shelf, behind the silver serving platters, was a wooden\ncrate. It held glass vials with corks in the top and each one was filled with a\nclear liquid. Adamat suddenly felt his heart hammering in his ears.\n“Bloody pit,” he said.\n“It’s there?”\n“Yes.”\nFell gave an audible sigh of relief.\n“Fetch Flerring the Younger,” Adamat said. “Probably best to have one\nof her professionals deal with the stuff.

The night was crisp, his breath visible to his powder-\nenhanced senses. Somewhere off to his left, a fish jumped in the water, and\nhe heard Andriya start behind him.\n“Shh,” Tamas said quietly. “Don’t get twitchy on me.”\nTamas was ready to reprimand him for a smart remark, but Andriya\nbehaved himself. They pushed forward, frogs going silent at their advance\nbut no sign of alarm in the fortress up ahead of them.\nFortress, Tamas reflected, was a stretch. The stone building was only\ntwo stories tall, with a twelve-foot wall that stretched from the riverside a\nhundred feet to the main highway. The whole thing was little more than an\ninspection station where government officers could check both carts on the\nroad and barges in the water for contraband and tax dodgers heading\nbetween Adopest and Budwiel.\nBefore the revolution, it would have been staffed by just eight to ten\nservants of the crown. The Kez, when they swept past this point, had\nreinforced the whole building. Small-caliber cannons had been mounted\nalong the wall and a sixteen-pound artillery piece had been placed on the\nend of the stone wharf that stuck out into the Addown. Tamas guessed that\nthey’d left no less than a forty-man garrison.\nTamas approached the base of the wharf, his eyes on the top of the\ninspection station. Torches lit the wall, and he could see the bobbing of a\nbayonet that betrayed the presence of a guard.\nSomething touched his arm and Tamas stopped, looking back. Andriya\npointed into the rushes, and after a moment Tamas could see a nest where a\nyearling goose eyed him angrily.\nHe waded deeper into the water to avoid the nest, then shoved his\npistol in his belt and tightened his sword against his thigh. He reached up\nuntil he could feel the stone ledge above him, and with a quick motion he\nwas up on the wharf.\nTamas drew his belt knife and padded toward the artillery piece sitting\nat the end. A Kez sentry leaned against it, his soft snores reaching Tamas’s\nears. He stiffened as Tamas’s knife took him between the ribs and a moment\nlater his body lay behind the cannon.

Tamas looked back toward the\ninspection station just in time to see Andriya, silent as a gliding owl, slip\nover the battlements above the second story. Tamas heard a pain-filled grunt\nand had to remind his hammering heart that he could hear far better than the\nguards inside.\nHe stole through the door to the inspection station. The garrison, if he\nremembered, correctly, would be on the second floor. He paused at the foot\nof the stairwell, a sound catching his ear, and went back past the door to the\nwharf.\nFour Kez soldiers were playing dice in the tiny mess hall by the light\nof a single lantern. Tamas eyed them through a slit in the door. They were\nintent upon their game and likely a little drunk. He decided to take care of\nthe sleeping ones upstairs first.\nHe was just about to step away when the door suddenly pushed open,\nnearly hitting him in the face. He leapt back, and a fifth guard stared at him\nin surprise.\nTamas slammed his knife into the man’s throat and drove him\nbackward into the room, shoving him across the main table. The other four\nguards jumped to their feet, shouting and scrambling for weapons. Tamas\nwas faster. He pulled his knife hand back and dragged it across a second\nguard’s throat before leaving it in the heart of a third. He leapt the table in a\nsingle bound, the powder trance singing in his veins. His foot came down\non the bench opposite and he barely had time to swear as it gave way\nbeneath him.\nHe stumbled upon landing and threw himself into a roll, tumbling\nacross the room. He came up beside the fourth guard just as the man turned\non him with a pistol. Tamas reached out with his senses and fizzled the\nignition of the powder as the hammer came down. He wrenched the pistol\nout of the man’s hand and slammed the butt into the guard’s face hard\nenough to hear his skull crack.\nThe fifth guard ran for the door. Tamas drew his boot knife and threw,\nflat-handed. The knife hit her just beneath the shoulder blade. She let out a\nyell, stumbled, and reached back for the hilt. Tamas crossed the room and\nbroke her neck.\nHe scrambled for both of his knives and took up a position beside the\ndoor. The silence was deafening. Where were the reinforcements? Where\nwere the sleeping guards?\nA single pair of boots sounded on the stone stairwell. Tamas hazarded\na glance, only to see Andriya appear. The man was covered in blood, but by\nthe looks of him none of it was his own. “You’re making too much noise,”\nAndriya said.\nTamas let out a soft sigh of relief, cleaned his knives, and led Andriya\nback upstairs. They passed the bunk room, where Tamas could hear a soft\ndeath rattle.\n“Take care of that,” he said.\nOn the roof, two sentries lay in pools of their own blood, and Tamas\nshielded his eyes from the flickering torches and surveyed Surkov’s Alley\nto his south. To his surprise, he saw nothing – no fires, no camping\ncompanies of Kez reserves. In the distance, he could see the torches of"

In the distance, he could see the torches of\nMidway Keep, and far beyond that the glittering lights of Budwiel.\nThe entire Kez army was now to his north.\nHe snatched one of the torches and waved it twice. Within moments\nthe ground to the north of the inspection station was writhing with the dark\nfigures of Adran soldiers as they flooded forward. He was joined a moment\nlater by Andriya.\n“Didn’t we do this once before?” Andriya asked. “Going behind the\nenemy’s lines? I seem to remember it didn’t end so well.”\nTamas glanced toward Andriya. Somehow, he had gotten even more\nblood on him. Olem, he reflected, might not be as good a killer as Andriya,\nbut he was far better company. “You should change your uniform.”\n“I don’t have a spare.”\n“That was shortsighted.”\nAndriya licked a bit of blood off the tip of one finger, a not entirely\nhuman smile playing upon his lips. “We climb the walls of Budwiel\ntomorrow. I want the bloody Kez to know what’s coming for them when\nthey see me.”\n“If you insist.” There was no “sir” when Andriya had his blood up like\nthis. Killing Kez was his favorite thing in this world. “Just stand upwind\nfrom me.”\nTamas turned to watch more of his army emerge from the darkness.\nThe vanguard had surrounded the inspection station now, and on the road he\ncould see the long, dark snake of his army marching forward through the\ndark. On the river to his right, several cargo barges moved into view, cutting\nquietly through the water, loaded down with heavy artillery.\n“The Kez army be damned,” Tamas said. “Nothing will stop me now.”\nNila’s first instinct after regaining consciousness was to scream.\nShe nearly bit her tongue in half to keep herself from doing so. Her\nhands were bound behind her back and her eyes opened on nothing but\ndarkness. Fear threatened to swallow her whole, adrenaline tearing through\nher veins and overwhelming the stiffness of her limbs and the saddle\nsoreness at her very core.\nShe slipped into the place between the real world and the Else almost\ninstinctually – in fact, it was several minutes before she realized what she\nhad done. Her breathing was calm, her heart no longer fluttering. The world\nfloated before her in a translucent haze. Bo had described this as a good\nplace to be calm and to think, but had warned her that her brain would not\nreceive the information that it needed to analyze the world around it.\nSounds were muted, and even the feel of the ground beneath her legs\nseemed distant.\nCautiously, she let herself leave that place, sinking back into the real\nworld. With it came all of the pain and aches of being alive and she couldn’t\nhelp but let out a slight whimper.\nA nighttime camp came into focus around her. She could hear low\nvoices, the crackling of a nearby fire, and the soft whinny of horses off in\nthe darkness. She lay on her side, her left arm numb, and the smell of vomit\nstung her nostrils.

A trail of crust along the corner of her mouth told her that\nthe vomit was hers.\nBlinking the tears of pain out of the corners of her eyes, she realized\nshe was staring into a bruised, blood-caked face. The man lay on his side,\nfacing her. He had been stripped to the waist and she could see thick black\nstripes on his bare shoulders and arms – he’d been whipped and beaten until\nhe was raw. His hands were bound behind his back. The inhumanity of it\nmade Nila want to recoil in horror.\nShe didn’t dare. If she moved, they would know she was awake and\nshe might be given similar treatment. If she was lucky.\nHer heart began to race again, the calm she had attained slipping away\nfrom her like grains of sand through her fingers. She could feel her arms\ntrembling and then…\nShe recognized the man lying beside her.\nIt was Olem.\nShe bit back a curse. Was he still alive? “Olem,” she whispered, her\nown pain forgotten. “Olem!”\nHis eyes opened far too slowly for Nila’s liking. It took several\nmoments before she could see the recognition in them. His short beard was\nmatted to his face with blood, but she could see the corner of his mouth\ntwitch upward.\n“Glad to see you awake.” He coughed.\n“What the pit did they do to you?” she hissed.\n“Just asked some questions.”\n“They beat you senseless!”\n“They didn’t like the answers.”\nShe wanted to ask him if she was next, but it seemed insensitive.\n“Barbarians.”\n“Yeah.” Olem shifted slightly, grunting in pain. “Pit, that hurts.”\n“They have to give you medicine. I’ll shout until they do. How can\nthey do this to a prisoner of war?”\n“Shh,” he said. “Don’t say a word. Keep still for as long as you can.\nMost of them are asleep. They won’t bother you till morning.”\nHer calm was completely gone now. “And if I wake them?”\n“I don’t know. The commanding officer is the Gurlish Wolf. He’ll do\njust about anything. The rest of them aren’t much better.”\n“I’ll burn this whole camp down.”\nOlem gave a slight shake of his head, grimacing as he did so. “They\ndon’t know you’re a Privileged.”\n“Really?”\n“No gloves, remember? I told them you were my secretary.”\nNila tried to find that place between reality and the Else again, but had\nno success. She couldn’t believe it had gone so wrong. One minute they’d\nbeen alone, and the next these Kez had erupted from the fog to kill them all.\n“We’re finished. Did they wipe us all out?”\nOlem’s eyes had closed and for a moment she thought he had passed\nout. Then, “No. They hadn’t expected us to all be in close formation. It was\nheavy fighting for a while, then I got separated from the rest of the\nregiment. Been listening. They captured fifteen or twenty of us, killed a few\ndozen more, but the rest of the boys are still out there.”\n“There’s hope, then?”"

They captured fifteen or twenty of us, killed a few\ndozen more, but the rest of the boys are still out there.”\n“There’s hope, then?”\nOlem didn’t respond to that. “Been listening,” he repeated. “They plan\non sending my head back to Tamas. Probably with you. Best chance for you\nto get away from this.”\n“No!” she said, a little too loudly. When no one seemed to take notice,\nshe went on. “They wouldn’t!”\n“They’re spreading fear and doubt. Trying to get Tamas off of Ipille’s\ntrail. My head seems like a solid idea.”\n“We’ll make a run for it,” Nila said. “We’ll slip out in the middle of the\nnight. We can —”\nOlem was shaking his head again. “Too dangerous. They’d just kill\nyou too. This is the best way. That’s why I told them who I was.”\n“Olem.” Her voice cracked, and she cleared her throat. “Olem, don’t\nsay that.”\n“Is all right,” he slurred. She could see his head droop. He was passing\nout.\n“Olem, stay with me!”\nThere was no response. Nila tried to wake him several more times, and\nshort of a cold bucket of water she didn’t think anything would do it. She\nprayed silently that he wouldn’t die right then and there.\nShe rolled over on her back and took stock of her surroundings. Forms\naround the nearby campfires snored in their bedrolls, and she could no\nlonger hear any talking. She and Olem appeared to be unguarded, and that\nseemed odd to her. It took several moments of considering this to realize\nthat they had no need of personal guards. He was beaten to within an inch\nof his life, and she was a mere secretary, and unconscious to boot.\nShe reached out and touched the Else. She could feel the sting of fire\non her chafed wrists as her bonds melted away beneath her sorcery. A brief\nhint of burning hemp touched her nostrils and she was free.\nCautiously, slowly, she got to her feet. She checked Olem’s pulse – he\nwas still alive, thank Adom – and then she began to walk quickly through\nthe camp. No one paid her any mind. No one was awake to do so, and if\nthey were, the still-thick fog obscured their vision. A few minutes later and\nshe was past the last campfire.\nShe literally tripped over the first sentry. He lay in a thicket, musket on\nhis chest, gently dozing until her foot hit him. He shot awake, a startled\nexclamation on his lips. She could see the outline of his face in the\ndarkness. She saw his eyes take in her blue uniform and then his mouth\nopen to yell a warning.\nHer hand shot forward, taking him by the throat.\nShe would not allow Olem to die for her safety. She would not allow\nherself to be beaten and humiliated and used by foreign savages.\nBlue fire shimmered and she felt his flesh give way beneath her\nfingers. She squeezed, feeling the melted flesh and warm, sizzling blood\nbetween her fingers. Her fingers wrapped around his spine and even that\nseemed to slide away, leaving the man’s head to roll down a hill and farther\ninto the thicket."

Her fingers wrapped around his spine and even that\nseemed to slide away, leaving the man’s head to roll down a hill and farther\ninto the thicket.\nNila was up and running a moment later. She didn’t have time to think\nabout the murder. It was just one more on top of the countless she’d\ncommitted over the past few weeks. She had to flee. The Kez magebreaker\nmight have sensed her sorcery – he could be on her trail in minutes.\nShe navigated the hills with the use of her third eye, fighting down\nnausea. Between the darkness and the fog, her regular vision would be\nuseless. She ran, forcing herself forward though each step made her want to\nscream in agony. Her thighs hurt from riding, her body from a night with\nher arms tied. Tears rolled down her cheeks from the pain, and her stomach\npitched like she had been at sea for weeks.\nHours passed. She stopped on every hilltop to listen for pursuit, but no\nsound followed her. She ran blindly – she would be hopeless at getting her\nbearings in the misty darkness. She knew that, for now, she had to get as far\naway from the Kez as possible. Though every hilltop looked the same to her\nin the Else, she attempted to memorize each one, tearing up grass or piling\nrocks whenever she could. She hoped that in the light of day she would be\nable to lead the Adran cavalry back the way she’d come.\nIt was Olem’s only chance.\nThe earliest light of morning tinged the mist. Nila could no longer\nopen her third eye. Exhaustion flooded her senses and it was all she could\ndo to keep stumbling through the dew-soaked grass. Her uniform was\nripped and sodden, her boots full of water. She clutched her arms to her\nchest, shivering violently.\nShe stopped to rest at the bottom of one of the countless ravines she\nhad traversed. Her fingers stiff, she used what was left of her strength to\ncoax a nimbus of flame from the Else. Kez pursuers be damned, she had to\nget warm! The flame sheathed her hands, then her arms, and she felt a dull\nwarmth work its way into her bones. Her shivering slowly subsided. Steam\nrose from her clothes, and with a startled curse she realized that the flame\nnow covered her whole body.\nIt winked out, leaving her standing at the bottom of the ravine, the\nworld once again cold and wet. She wanted nothing more than to lie down\nin the muck and sleep. The Kez be damned. Field Marshal Tamas be\ndamned.\nA vision of Olem’s face, his beard matted with blood and his flesh torn\nto ribbons, sprang into her mind. That was all it took for her to begin to\nclimb the side of the ravine.\nThe rising sun began to burn away the mist. If the fog cleared, she\ncould get her bearings. She would head east in the hope that the rest of the\nRiflejacks were looking for the Kez camp to save Olem. It was risky, if the\nKez were, in turn, looking for her.

The peaks and valleys of Brude’s\nHideaway played tricks on her ears, and she struggled on to the next rise,\nwhere she stopped to listen, peering into the thinning morning fog.\nShe thought she heard a shout. Whether Kez or Adran, she did not\nknow. It was impossible to get a bearing on the sound. Please, she thought,\nplease be Adran. She strained, head tilted to the side, until she heard it\nagain.\nThe sound came from behind her. She began to move again, heading\ncautiously onward. An Adran scouting party could have gotten behind her.\nAfter all, she didn’t know north from south right now. She could be heading\njust about any direction.\nAnother shout. Nila’s senses pricked at the sound and a chill went\ndown her spine. It hadn’t been quite intelligible, but that sounded Kez.\nThe clop of hooves on stone reached her ears. She had crossed a series\nof flat rocks a while back, hadn’t she? Those hooves were following her,\nand the shouts were getting closer.\nShe broke into a sprint, calling up every ounce of her energy for the\nrun. They were on her trail now and when they found her, they would run\nher down like a tired dog in the street. A glance over her shoulder showed\nmen on horseback less than two hundred yards behind her.\nLeaping across a streambed, Nila scaled a steep escarpment and threw\nherself down the other side, tumbling head over heels down a hill. She was\nback up a moment later, ready to run, when the sight of a mounted figure\nbrought her up short.\nThe figure was less than ten paces away. It sat silently, the fog barely\nseeming to touch it, the rider’s body cloaked against the weather. Steam\nrose from the horse’s nostrils, indicating it had just made a hard ride.\nShe was cut off. The Kez had her now. Nila stiffened and waited for\nthe figure to draw his or her pistol and fire.\n“Why do you run?”\nThe voice startled her and she nearly fell. It was speaking in Adran. A\nmale voice. “What?”\nThe figure slapped his saddle horn angrily. “Why do you run?” he\ndemanded.\nHorses rounded the far side of the escarpment thirty paces to Nila’s\nleft. There were a dozen of them, coming hard, and she saw carbines raised\nto fire.\n“Bo?” she asked, breathless.\n“You aren’t a fox, fleeing before the hounds! You are a goddess of fire\nto these ants.”\nWhat was Bo doing here? How had he found her? “The magebreaker\nis chasing…” Nila ran toward him. The two of them might have a chance of\nescaping on his horse.\n“He’s not with them. You should have stopped to check. Turn and\ndefend yourself. Show them what you are!” Bo’s voice rose to a bellow at\nthe end. Nila stared at him, astonishment freezing her in her tracks.\nThe crack of a carbine snapped through her thoughts and she found"

She made a flinging motion with her off-hand\nand fire like liquid gold spewed from her fingertips. The flames crossed the\nspace in the blink of an eye and cut through men and horses like a bullet\nthrough paper. Black powder exploded on contact with the flames, and a\nsingle cry of dismay reached her ears before the entire party was gone,\nreduced to a black, smoking skid on hissing soil.\nNila stared at the spot for several moments, trying to process what\nshe’d just done. There had been no thought, no concentration. She’d just\nkilled a dozen men and horses purely by instinct. The air hung heavy with\nacrid black smoke and the smell of burned meat.\n“Well done.”\n“I…” She turned to look up at Bo and could instantly see that\nsomething was wrong. He slumped in his saddle, his face pale and sweat on\nhis brow. He swayed back and forth, knuckles white on the saddle horn.\n“Never run from a fight you can win. By the saints, you’re going to be\npowerful. I’ve never seen such… beauty.” His words were labored and\nbreathless.\n“What are you doing here? Are you all right?” Nila rushed to his side\nand put a hand on his leg, from which she immediately recoiled. She had\ntouched something hard and thin, and when she reached forward to lift his\npant leg, she found not flesh, but a wooden prosthetic where his calf had\nonce been.\nHe didn’t seem to notice. “I got your… note.” He fumbled at his jacket\npocket and removed a creased paper. It fluttered from his fingers and he\nmade a weak attempt at catching it.\nNila snatched it out of the air, barely remembering the angry words\nshe’d scribbled down before riding off with Olem. All thoughts of the\ncharred remains behind her were gone. Memories of the way she’d been\ntreated by the Deliv Privileged were shoved aside. “Bo. What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing, nothing.” He frowned at the paper now in her hand. “I’ve…\nI didn’t think… it proper… my apprentice off on her… own.” His words\nwere halting and disjointed.\n“Bo?”\nHe waved away her concern, and promptly slid from his saddle. She\nthrew herself beneath him and they both went down in a heap beside the\nhorse. She looked up in horror at the prosthetic still stuck in the stirrup, and\nthe empty pant leg beneath his knee.\n“Sorry,” he said. “Feeling a bit fuzzy.”\nNila felt tears in her eyes. Bo was her only hope of getting away, and\nhere he was, crippled and sickly. How would they be able to find the Adran\ncavalry and return to rescue Olem? She briefly considered leaving him here\nand taking his horse, but that could very well be the death of him, and she\ncouldn’t do that. Not after he’d brought himself out here to find her.\nBo’s eyes were closed and she could see his chest rising and falling\nslowly.

She fought back her tears, angry at herself. This was\nthe kind of weakness he despised, wasn’t it?\n“That’s enough of that,” Bo whispered. His eyes remained closed.\n“You’re safe now.”\n“You’re not, you bloody idiot!”\n“Oh, I’ll be… fine.”\nNila held him close and knew she had to act soon. She could only save\none of them – Bo or Olem. And Olem might already be dead.\n“Where are the Adran cavalry?” she asked.\n“I got a bit ahead of them,” Bo said, seemingly able to keep his\nsentences coherent only when he whispered. “I rode hard when I saw your\nsorcery in the Else.”\n“Ahead of them?”\n“They’ll be along… ah. There they are.”\nNila raised her head. The creaking of saddles and the jostling of\nweaponry suddenly reached her, and from the depth of the fog emerged\nhundreds of cuirassiers, their breastplates beaded with morning dew,\ncarbines resting across their saddles.\nBo gave a groan and rolled out of her arms. He snatched the prosthetic\nfrom the stirrup and rolled up his pant leg. She caught sight of a leather\nharness attached to the healed, but ruined remnants of his knee. He strapped\nthe prosthetic to the harness. Nila got to her feet, drying her cheeks, and\nhelped Bo up and, at his insistence, back in the saddle.\nA cuirassier rode forward holding the reins to Nila’s horse. “Privileged\nNila,” he said, his voice booming in the quiet of the morning. “Thank\nAdom we found you.”\n“Indeed,” was the only reply she could manage. Her knees felt like\njelly beneath her, but she knew that this morning wasn’t over. She took the\nreins, never having thought she’d be so relieved to see a horse. Raising her\nvoice, she said, “They have Colonel Olem. He couldn’t escape with me\nbecause they had flogged him half to death.”\nAn angry mutter spread through the cuirassiers. “Can you lead us to\ntheir camp?” one of them asked.\nNila closed her eyes, trying to picture every rise and valley she’d\ncrossed in her desperate flight. It was a jumbled haze in her memory, but\nshe knew the Kez cavalry that had chased her would leave a trail more\neasily followed.\n“Yes. Let’s go.”\nCHAPTER 39\n“I\nnever thought I’d see the day when I assaulted one of my own cities.”\nTamas stared at the walls of Budwiel. The city sat in the narrowest spot\nin Surkov’s Alley, flanked on either side by the immense, sheer cliffs called\nthe Gates of Wasal. There was no way into the city but over those\nformidable granite walls, each stone protected by sorcery as old as the city\nitself. If not for what he now knew to be Hilanska’s treachery, the same\nwalls on the south side of the city would have withstood months of\nbombardment by the Kez army.\nAnd now Tamas had to take the city in a single day."

The ancient general looked older\nthan ever, but there was an excited fire in his eyes. He flexed his jaw,\npopping his false teeth out into one hand. “Aye. It’ll be a pit of a fight.”\n“Ipille has lined the walls with his personal guard,” Tamas said.\n“They’ll fight tooth and nail for their king. Once we breach the city walls,\nevery street will be a bloodbath.”\n“I can give you some good news on that,” Arbor said. “I’ve dug up Ket\nand Hilanska’s spy reports, and if they’re to be believed, the Kez have left\nfew enough of our people inside unmolested. Most were slaughtered in the\ninitial attack and the rest have been sold as slaves.”\n“That’s the worst good news I’ve ever heard.” Tamas wanted to spit,\nbut he knew it wouldn’t remove the bad taste in his mouth.\nArbor gave him a toothless grin. “Just trying to say that there’s no\nharm in shelling the city! You have to look at the bright side of these things,\nsir.”\n“You’re not making me feel any better.”\nDoubt assaulted Tamas on all sides. Where was Taniel? There hadn’t\nbeen word or sign of him yet. If he had succeeded in his task of rescuing\nKa-poel, Tamas would have heard by now. He didn’t want to think of the\nalternatives.\nAround Tamas, his camp swirled with motion. Artillery that they had\nsent south on the Addown River was being moved into position as earthen\nfortifications went up. Ladders and hooks, spare ammunition, and fresh\nrifles were all being unloaded from the barges. Tents had been pitched, and\nhis tired men were taking shifts to get a couple hours’ rest before the attack.\nLast night they had taken Midway Keep, making enough noise to draw\nIpille’s personal guard out of Budwiel and into a half-dozen skirmishes\nthroughout the earliest hours of the morning. The guard had slowed him\ndown by a couple of hours before they retreated into the city, and now their\nsilver conical helmets lined the tops of the walls three men deep.\nA puff of smoke rose over the walls and a moment later Tamas heard\nthe report of cannon fire. The ball slammed into the earth several hundred\nyards in front of Tamas’s foremost artillery pieces.\nArbor gave a mirthless chuckle. “Those walls aren’t designed to hold\nheavy cannon. They won’t be able to shoot back at us with anything bigger\nthan short-range six-pounders.”\n“I’m more worried about the grapeshot when we assault the walls,”\nTamas replied. “More’s the pity that we don’t have time to wait them out.\nWe’re going to have to charge straight into their teeth.”\n“Really?” Arbor held his false teeth at arm’s length and picked\nsomething out from between them. “I’m all for a good charge, but we won’t\nhope to put a scratch in that wall today, not if we had fifty more cannon"

And, uh, no offense meant, sir, but sending twenty thousand\nmen over those walls will be just about the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen\nyou do.”\n“I’m a desperate man, Arbor.” He glanced over his shoulder, craning\nhis head to look back up Surkov’s Alley. He wondered if the main Kez\narmy had grown wise to his plan and were coming up fast behind him.\nSulem was to have joined them in battle yesterday afternoon to keep them\nfrom marching back down to pinion Tamas against the walls of Budwiel. If\nthe Kez had escaped the Deliv, this would end in disaster. “Come with me.”\nArbor followed him from their vantage point down toward the largest\nartillery battery, Andriya shadowing them the whole way. Tamas’s newest\nbodyguard was coated in dry blood and smelled like a slaughterhouse.\nAnyone else but one of his powder mages, and Tamas would have had the\nman forcibly washed. This afternoon, though, he needed Andriya’s gun and\nblade.\n“Colonel Silvia,” Tamas called, catching the attention of one of the\nartillery crews. Silvia was a middle-aged woman with brown, short-cropped\nhair and a mouselike face stained with black powder. The cuffs of her\nuniform were almost black with the stuff as well. Tamas had to go all the\nway down to a captain to find an experienced artilleryman that hadn’t been\na friend or student of General Hilanska, and Silvia had in a single day found\nherself a colonel in command of Tamas’s bombardment.\n“Sir!” She stood, snapping a salute.\n“You almost ready?”\n“Getting there, sir. A few more mortars to move into position and then\nwe’ll start the bombardment on your order. We’ll sweep the walls and just\nbehind them with the mortars and focus direct fire on the main gate.”\n“Cancel that. You have a spyglass?”\n“Yes sir.” She produced a spyglass from her kit and snapped it open,\nthen waited for Tamas’s instruction.\n“Go about three hundred yards to the east of the main gate. Do you see\na pattern of discolored stones? They look almost like a face. It’s very faint.”\n“I don’t… wait, I see it. Adom, looks like a grinning skull.”\n“Fire a pattern of straight shot right at the nose. Hit, wait seven counts,\nhit, wait two counts, hit, and wait another four. It might take you a few\ntries.”\nSilvia had lowered her spyglass to look curiously at Tamas. “Sir?”\n“What is that?” General Arbor asked. “Some kind of combination?”\n“In a manner of speaking. The royal cabal that wove the wards into\nthat wall so many hundreds of years ago left a backup plan in case Budwiel\never fell to the Kez and we were forced to take it back. Do this, and that\nsection of the wall will be vulnerable to our cannon fire.”\n“And how the bloody pit do you know that?” Arbor asked.\nTamas snorted. “I was the Iron King’s favorite, Arbor.

It came with\nsome perks.” And if this doesn’t work, he reminded himself silently, I’ll look\nlike a complete idiot.\n“When do you want me to start, sir?” Silvia asked.\n“Begin your shelling of the main gate as soon as you’re ready. Have a\ngrouping of cannons standing by to wait for my signal to fire at that\nparticular spot. We won’t be ready to attack for at least an hour.”\nTamas strode back to his command tent, Arbor at his side. “Sir, what\nhappens if Ipille has already fled toward his capital?” Arbor asked.\n“Then we’ll hunt him down like a bloody dog,” Tamas said with a\nconfidence he didn’t feel. Ipille might have left two days ago. He could be\nso far ahead as to make it impossible to catch him. It was a risk Tamas was\nwilling to take.\n“Keep everyone working,” Tamas said as he reached his tent. “And\nkeep formations loose. I don’t want the Kez to suspect that we’ll assault\ntoday until the very last minute.” He slapped Arbor on the shoulder, and the\ngeneral saluted him, false teeth still in one hand.\nTamas ducked inside and let himself sag against the main tent post,\nsqueezing his eyes shut. His nerves were raw, his body strung out from too\nmuch powder and too little sleep, and the effort of hiding his exhaustion\nfrom the men. “One more day, Tamas,” he muttered to himself. “It’ll either\nall be over tonight or you’ll be dead at the foot of Budwiel’s walls.”\n“That’s why most commanders don’t lead the charge themselves.”\nTamas drew his sword and whirled toward the voice. Gavril sat on\nTamas’s cot, his whole body caked with road dust, the sleeve of one arm\nsliced through and stiff with dried blood.\n“Bloody pit,” Tamas said, sheathing his sword. “That’s about the\nclosest I’ve ever come to a heart attack. What the pit are you doing here?\nWhere’s Taniel? Get out of my bed.”\nGavril threw up both hands but made no motion to stand. “I’m resting.\nI just rode all the way down the Counter’s Road, dodging Kez patrols.\nReached the Deliv camp a few hours after you left and commandeered a\ncanoe and paddled the whole way here on the Addown.”\nTamas paced his tent. He had planned to plug his ears with wax and\ncatch a few hours of sleep before the attack, while his artillery scattered\nIpille’s men from the walls. No chance of that now. “And Taniel? The girl?\nWhere are they? Spit it out, man!”\n“Taniel’s alive, Vlora too and Norrine. We lost everyone else in an\nambush.”\n“And the savage?”\n“No sign of Ka-poel. When I left, we still hadn’t caught up to the\nPrivileged.”\n“Then what are you doing here?” Had Taniel followed the Kez\nPrivileged down here and slipped inside Budwiel? Had he been captured by\nKez patrols? Tamas found himself growing more nervous every moment"

Tamas found himself growing more nervous every moment\nGavril didn’t speak.\n“You should probably sit down,” Gavril said.\n“I’ll sit when I damn well feel like sitting!”\n“The Kez didn’t break the parley. It was the Brudanians in disguise.”\nTamas stumbled to his chair and fell into it. “No,” he said, the word\ncoming out as a gasp.\n“Afraid so. Captured a couple grenadiers in the fight. Imagine our\nsurprise when not one of them speaks a word of Kez. What’s more, they\nweren’t heading south. They were heading north, going far out and around\nto avoid any of our people between the army and Adopest. Vlora and Taniel\nare on their trail now, but we suspect they’re going to meet up with the rest\nof the Brudanians in Adro. Are you all right?”\nTamas stared at his brother-in-law for several moments, his mouth\nhanging open. How could this have happened? He had been played like a\nfool. The Kez hadn’t broken the parley. He had. Blinded so thoroughly by\nhis own righteous anger, he had ignored Ipille’s pleas for another meeting\nand dismissed the Kez messengers.\nHe was too old for this. Too proud, too angry. He had made mistakes\nin his time – even the best officer did – but the magnitude of this…\n“You couldn’t have known,” Gavril said quietly.\n“No.” Tamas let out a mirthless laugh. “I’ve become what I most\ndespise. Am I nothing more than a warmonger, Gavril? Another dictator\nwith an army and a grudge? You know, that’s what the old tales say that the\nNine was like back before Kresimir came. They were just a collection of\nsquabbling warlords.”\n“It’s not like that.”\nTamas went on. “I see a vision of the future, revolutions spreading out\nacross the lands as people pull down their monarchs. The strongest men,\nunordained by saints or gods, rise to the top and carve out their own petty\nempires. Men and women die by the millions and all the progress that our\nworld has made in the last thousand years is lost in the dust of time. All\nbecause of me.”\nTamas held his fingers in front of his face, watching them tremble.\n“I think you give yourself too much credit.”\nThe vision floating before Tamas’s eyes slowly faded and he felt older\nthan time itself. Every muscle ached, every bone remembered its old breaks\nand bruises.\nThe thump of artillery brought Tamas back to the present. “Are you\nwounded?”\nGavril glanced at his blood-soaked sleeve. “Just a scratch. I gave\nmyself stitches while I rode.”\n“You should have them redone. Probably looks like they were made by\na blind monkey.”\n“Poked myself a few times, but they’re straight and the wound is\nclean.

The\nDeliv have engaged the main Kez force, but I passed a column in the\nmiddle of the night.”\n“Kez?”\n“Yes. Coming for you. Didn’t look like more than a few thousand –\nthey’re far more worried about the Deliv infantry – but it’ll be enough to\nput you in a damned tight spot.”\n“How far?”\n“A couple hours.”\n“You should have probably mentioned this earlier.”\nGavril yawned. “It was a long night.”\n“You hear any news about Olem?”\n“No,” Gavril said. “Should I have?”\n“He’s chasing Kez cavalry that got behind us up north. Never mind\nthat. Andriya!” Tamas shouted.\nThe powder mage put his head in the tent. “Sir?”\n“Tell Arbor we have company coming up behind us. He has forty-five\nminutes until we assault the walls, and we’ll only have time for one attack.”\n“Yes sir!” Andriya left to find Arbor, looking as giddy as a schoolboy.\n“There’s something wrong with that boy’s head,” Gavril said.\n“You know, he’s one of the ones Erika saved. A year before she\nwas…”\n“That doesn’t explain the blood all over him.”\n“He revels in killing his former countrymen. Perhaps a little too much,\nbut people like that have their uses. For instance, there are few soldiers I\nwould want more clearing the way for me as we go through the breach or\nover that wall.”\nGavril ran his fingers gingerly over his shoulder. “I don’t think you\nshould take part in the attack,” he said.\n“I always have.”\n“You’re not a young man anymore.”\n“Don’t I know it.” Tamas shook his head. “Some men lead from the\nback. I prefer to do it from the front.”\n“It just takes one lucky musket ball. One thrust of a bayonet.”\n“That knowledge has never stopped me before.”\n“When will your luck run out?”\nTamas extended a hand. “Maybe today. Maybe never. Help me up. I\nhave another king to kill.”\n“I thought you just meant to capture him.” Gavril helped Tamas climb\nto his feet.\nTamas grimaced. “I will. Wishful thinking, I suppose. I’ll be out in a\nminute.”\nGavril went on ahead. Once he was alone, Tamas leaned over, hands\non his knees, and took several deep breaths. He’d made a horrid mistake.\nMany of them over the course of this short war, now that he paused to look\nback. Too many. Misplaced trust. Bad timing. This final misstep with the\nKez – it needed to be his last. When it was all over, he had to put down his\npistol and walk away, or else everything he had fought for would be for\nnaught and his vision would come true.\nStraightening, Tamas adjusted his sword and checked his pocket to be\nsure he had enough powder charges, then marched out into the sun.\nIt was time.\nCHAPTER 40\nA\ndamat’s questioning of the kitchen staff revealed two important things:"

    "text": "sure he had enough powder charges, then marched out into the sun.\nIt was time.\nCHAPTER 40\nA\ndamat’s questioning of the kitchen staff revealed two important things:\nThe first was that Ricard’s security was not nearly as good as he\nclaimed it was. The second was that a man named Denni of Rhodigas had\nleft the blasting oil behind the silver over two weeks ago. He told one of the\nscullery maids that they were bottles of imported vodka specifically for\nRicard’s next birthday and gave her a fifty-krana note to keep quiet about\nthe “surprise.”\nThe poor girl had broken down weeping when Fell told her what,\nexactly, the bottles were. It was enough to convince Adamat that she wasn’t\nin on the plot, though he still told Fell to have her watched for a few days.\nAdamat knew Denni, but only by reputation. He was a jack-of-all-\ntrades – a con man, muscle-for-hire, thief, and smuggler. He lacked both\nambition and vision, and while he had helped Ricard set up the first union,\nhe had not wanted the responsibility of actually running anything.\n“He’s really not a bad guy,” Ricard repeated for the third time in as\nmany hours.\nAdamat leaned against the cold brick wall of the basement Underhill\nSociety secret room, clutching his cane in one hand, the head already\ntwisted so he could withdraw his sword swiftly. The candelabras were lit, a\ndeck of cards laid on the table, and cold drinks set out. Everything was\nprepared as it should be for the society, in addition to hiding two of Ricard’s\nenforcers in the basement niches and placing SouSmith innocuously near\nthe front door of the hotel.\n“He tried to kill you,” Adamat replied.\nRicard sat behind the card table, fiddling with a corkscrew. “He might\nnot have known.”\n“Oh?” Adamat rolled his eyes. “That you, the head of the union, would\nhave been at a union function in your own headquarters when he threw a\nbomb into your office? Or maybe he threw the second bomb, the one that\nlanded beside your wine collection, where you spend plenty of time.”\n“He might not have thrown the bombs at all,” Ricard said. “He might\nhave bought them for someone else.”\nFell sat beside Ricard, chewing thoughtfully on a handful of cashews.\n“That’s what we mean to find out.”\nAdamat felt for Ricard. He really did. The members of the Underhill\nSociety had been his closest friends and allies for over twenty years and\nsecrecy was part of the mystique of their business cabal. Betraying\nsomething like that was very difficult.\nBut it had to be done.\n“He’s late,” Adamat said, checking his pocket watch.\n“He’s always late,” Ricard responded.\n“You’ve delayed the others?” The only way to get Denni to come in\nwas to hold Ricard’s regular weekly meeting. Everything had to seem\ncompletely normal. That required invitations to everyone else in the society.\n“Yes,” Fell said. “They’ll all be at least a half hour late. Denni isn’t\nusually more than ten minutes behind schedule.”\n“And you’re sure he’ll come?”"

Denni isn’t\nusually more than ten minutes behind schedule.”\n“And you’re sure he’ll come?”\n“I’m sure,” Ricard said. “He doesn’t get a lot of work these days. Lots\nof time on his hands.”\n“Unless he suspects something,” Adamat muttered.\n“He was here last week,” Fell said.\nRicard asked, rubbing at his bald spot, “Is this really necessary? I\ncould just talk to him.”\n“You’re being naïve, Ricard,” Adamat said.\nRicard picked beneath his fingernails with the corkscrew and gave an\nexasperated sigh. “All right, all right. Maybe I am. Get on with it, damn it.\nLook at me, bullied around by my own hirelings.”\n“If I was just another hireling, I would have turned down the job,”\nAdamat said sharply. “I am here as your friend. Understand?” He opened\nhis mouth to continue, his ire raised by Ricard’s unwillingness to do what\nwas necessary, but the sound of footsteps on the basement stairs caught his\nattention. It was a heavy tread and it came down the hallway without\nhesitation. He tightened his hand on his cane.\nDenni of Rhodigas was a little shorter than Adamat but built like a\nstrongbox with broad shoulders, thick arms, and very little body fat. He\nwore a brown tailored suit and held a top hat in one hand and a cane in the\nother. His curly black hair was cropped above his ears. His eyes went to\nFell, sitting beside Ricard, and he frowned. Then he saw Adamat waiting\nover by the wall.\n“Denni,” Adamat said. “We have some questions for you.”\nAdamat threw himself out of the way as Denni leapt forward, swinging\nhis cane like a truncheon. He raised his own cane, ready to deflect another\nattack, but it had only been a feint. Denni was already gone, sprinting back\nup the hallway.\n“Now!” Adamat cried. He set upon Denni’s heels, with Fell right\nbehind him. By the dim light of the basement hall he caught a glimpse of a\nstruggle. “Careful!” he said. “He might have —” There was a spark, and he\nwas deafened by the sudden blast of a pistol going off in the confined space.\nOne of Ricard’s enforcers collapsed. By the time Adamat reached the\nscuffle, the second enforcer was reeling beneath the butt of Denni’s pistol.\nHe stumbled backward and tripped, falling into the hotel’s wine collection.\nThe roar of a hundred glass bottles smashing to the floor at once seemed\ndistant in Adamat’s deafened ears.\nAdamat swung his cane, but only managed to strike air, as Denni was\nalready on his way up the stairs. Adamat was pushed aside by Fell, who he\nscrambled to follow.\nAdamat rushed through the halls of the hotel, then the kitchen and the\npantry, and then out a back door into the alley behind the building, barely\ncatching glimpses of Fell’s back as she chased Denni.

Adamat was already breathing hard, his heart pounding, when\nhe reached the main road.\nThe avenue was not crowded at this time of the evening, but there was\nenough traffic to worry Adamat that Denni might have the extra bottle of\nblasting oil on his person. He tried to search his memory as he ran,\npicturing Denni as he came into the Society room. Had there been a bulge\nin his jacket pocket? One at his belt as well? That explained the pistol, but\nthe other one could be anything – his knife, another pistol, or the bottle of\nblasting oil.\nHe caught sight of Denni sprinting down the thoroughfare, cane in\nhand, his hat dropped somewhere along the way. Fell was close behind him,\nbut not gaining quickly enough.\nAdamat cut across the street as Denni ducked into an alleyway,\nrunning parallel to Denni’s escape route until he reached the next street. He\nrounded the corner a moment later, his lungs burning, and ran toward the\nnext alleyway.\nDenni appeared from that alley a moment later. He swung around,\nheading straight toward Adamat.\n“Stop!” Adamat shouted. He drew his cane sword and planted himself\nin Denni’s path.\nDenni didn’t even slow down. He raised his cane and swung with his\npowerful shoulders, forcing Adamat to parry the blow or risk being brained\nabout the head. Adamat felt the cane sword wrenched from his fingers and\nsaw it clatter off down the cobbles. Denni planted a shoulder in his chest,\nand Adamat felt like he’d been hit by a charging horse. He was flung to the\nground with enough force to rattle his bones.\nHe rolled onto his hands and knees, spitting blood and cursing. He\nlooked up, expecting to see Denni disappearing down the street.\nBut Denni had stopped and turned toward Adamat, just twenty paces\naway. Adamat’s heart leapt into his throat as Denni pulled a stoppered glass\nvial from his pocket. He didn’t have time to think as Denni flung the vial at\nhim and turned to sprint away.\nAdamat threw his arms up over his face. The whole world seemed to\nslow to a crawl, every regret and mistake flashing before his eyes as the\nblasting oil arched toward him. He’d seen the power of the stuff. There\nwouldn’t be enough left of him to scrape off the cobbles, and he found\nhimself grimly hoping that Denni had misjudged the distance and was still\nwithin the blast radius.\nThere was a flash of movement as Fell sped past him. She reached out\none hand and snatched the blasting oil out of the air. She pivoted on one leg,\nspinning, and went to her knee, setting the blasting oil carefully on the\ncobbles before Adamat’s eyes. A moment later she was off again, chasing\nafter Denni.\nAdamat’s hands trembled, but he snatched up the blasting oil lest a\npasserby accidentally kick it. He wondered how the pit the stuff hadn’t gone\noff during the scuffle and chase, and chastised himself for ever doubting"

He wondered how the pit the stuff hadn’t gone\noff during the scuffle and chase, and chastised himself for ever doubting\nFell.\n“I thought you said he wouldn’t be armed!” Adamat said as Ricard\nrounded the corner behind him, huffing and puffing.\nRicard gasped out, “He wasn’t supposed to be.”\n“He either got tipped off or he was planning on finishing the job\ntonight. Hold this.” Adamat put the vial in Ricard’s outstretched hand.\n“Don’t drop it!” He grabbed his cane sword and set off in pursuit of Fell,\nhoping that Denni didn’t have the other missing bottle on his person.\nHe sprinted down the road, listening for sounds of the chase over his\nown labored breathing. He caught sight of Fell as she raced across a side\nstreet. Adamat followed, then crossed another road and ran into a shoe\nshop. Shoes lay on the floor, shelves tipped over by Denni in his rush to get\naway. An old cordwainer crouched behind his workbench and let out a\nstartled moan as Adamat tore through the front room, down the hall, and out\ninto the alley.\nHe entered the dimly lit alleyway just in time to see Fell corner Denni\nat a dead end. Denni whirled toward her, his spent pistol held by the barrel.\nWhen he saw Adamat, he lunged at Fell, likely hoping to take her down\nbefore Adamat could help.\nThe first swing went wide. Fell leapt, catlike, to one side and jabbed\nDenni in the throat with one hand. The blow would have sent any other man\nto the ground, windpipe collapsed, but Denni seemed to shrug it off and\nswung his pistol again.\n“We need him to talk!” Adamat shouted, his voice echoing down the\nalley.\nFell caught the falling pistol butt with one hand, dropping to one knee\nbeneath the force of the blow. Her fist shot out once again, slamming Denni\nhard in the balls before she got to her feet and closed the gap between them,\nher hand clawlike on his throat. She ducked, slipping beneath one arm, and\ncame up behind Denni, stiletto in her hand, pressed against his cheek just\nbelow the eye.\nDenni froze.\nThe whole fight occurred in the time it took Adamat to reach them. He\nslowed to a walk, and his heart felt near to bursting. He had to put a hand\nagainst the alley wall to support himself.\nWhen he’d finally recovered, he stood up and straightened his jacket,\nstepping up to Denni with his cane sword in hand. “You have a lot of\nexplaining to do. Where is the last vial of blasting oil?” Adamat asked.\n“I don’t know. I don’t have it.”\n“Who has it? Who hired you to bomb the union headquarters?”\nDenni sniffed, putting up a tough façade.\n“The easy way gets your ass thrown in a cell. The hard way, and she\ncarves out one of your eyes, and then we break your kneecaps.”\nDenni choked, then inhaled slightly as Fell pressed the stiletto harder\nagainst his cheek. “It was Cheris!”\n“Excuse me?” Adamat lowered the tip of his cane sword."

The tip of her knife didn’t leave Denni’s\ncheek.\n“Bloody pit! Bring him with! Ricard,” Adamat said as the union boss\nentered the alley from the cordwainer’s back door. “Get the police.

He seemed to have gained a second\nwind, head up and eyes alert, but she could see the rings under his eyes and\nthe grimace that he tried to hide as he was jostled in his saddle.\n“Your leg,” she said quietly as they rode just behind the vanguard of\nthe Riflejack cavalry. The scouts were up ahead, following the trail her Kez\npursuers had left.\nBo slouched in his saddle. “What about it?”\n“They couldn’t…”\n“No, they couldn’t. The flesh was too damaged at the knee. Healers\ncan work miracles, but there’s a limit to what they can do. If they had\nmanaged it, I’d be two inches shorter on the left side and unable to bend my\nleg.”\nNila imagined Bo strutting down the street, jerking along like a\nmarionette, trying to look casual. She swallowed an inappropriate laugh,\ncovering her mouth, and tried to play it off as Bo glared at her. When he\nfinally looked away, he said, “Yeah, that would have been kind of funny.”\n“I’m so sorry, Bo.”\n“Don’t be. I’m lucky to have everything above the knee. Let’s just get\nthis over with so I can get out of this bloody saddle. Are we getting close?”\nNila looked around. “It all looks the same in the fog,” she said, then\npointed to a scuff in the dirt on a hilltop. “That’s one of my marks.”\n“All right.” Bo took a flask from his pocket and took a swig.\n“Should you be drinking before a fight?”\n“Better I drink now than pass out from the pain halfway through the\nbattle.”\nThey rode on in silence until word was passed quietly back that they\nwere to halt. One of the scouts approached Nila and Bo, and tipped his hat.\n“We have them, Privileged. They’re camped in a valley over the next hill.”\n“Carry on,” Bo said.\n“Do you want me to stay close?” Nila asked.\n“Any other time I would say yes,” Bo said with a tired but flirtatious"

Keep\nyour fire to a short distance, lest you blast our own people. A fight like this\nrequires deft execution, not brute force.”\nThe cavalry split into two groups and created a horseshoe-shaped\nformation around the valley in which the Kez had camped. Nila could smell\ncook fires now, and she thought she heard muffled voices in the fog. Her\nwedge of cavalry formed up and she was assigned an escort of two heavily\narmed cuirassiers to keep her safe.\nNila tried to steady her breathing as she waited for the signal. She\ndidn’t have the training for this kind of fight. She didn’t have the training\nfor any kind of fight. All she knew how to do was unleash herself, and even\nthen it only seemed to work half the time.\nShe didn’t have time to panic any longer. A horn was blown and the\ncavalry leapt forward, charging the Kez camp. They swept down into the\nvalley, swords at the ready, and thundered in among the tents and fire rings.\nNila resisted the urge to summon fire to surround her hands – not only\nwould she burn through her reins but she would work best with the element\nof surprise here.\nShe heard the clash of swords and the fire of muskets and carbines,\nwhile her own wedge of the cavalry continued forward unopposed. One\nman beside her commented on the lack of resistance, but they surged on,\nspurred by the sounds of the clash up ahead.\nShe recognized this bit of the camp. She remembered sneaking through\nit last night on her flight out. Somewhere nearby was the poor sentry whose\nneck she had burned through.\nShe saw the body of an Adran soldier lying in the mud. “Olem!” she\nshouted, digging in with her heels. Her horse jumped forward, nearly\nthrowing her. She drew close enough to realize that the body did not belong\nto Olem. But the man’s head was near slashed from his shoulders, fresh\nblood pouring from his neck. She saw another body in a similar state, then\nanother. The Kez were killing their prisoners.\nA Kez soldier emerged from the fog standing above the kneeling\nfigure of an Adran soldier. She recognized the scourged shoulders and the\nblood-caked beard of the kneeling man.\nThe Kez soldier’s sword flashed.\nNila reacted out of panic and instinct, her fingers twitching, and her\nfire took the Kez soldier’s head off as cleanly as a cannonball. The Kez’s\nbody fell, and slowly, tiredly, Olem raised his head.\nNila fought to gain control of her horse as her bodyguards clashed with\nseveral other Kez soldiers on foot.

She cut his bonds, only for him to wrench\nthe gag from his own mouth.\n“Behind you, you fools!” he bellowed.\nEntangled with the few Kez remaining on foot, the Adran cavalry\nstruggled to turn back toward the sudden charge coming up behind them.\nThe bulk of the Kez dragoons slammed into their flank with a thunderous\nconcussion, cutting their way through Adran cuirassiers that had only\nmoments ago held the upper hand.\nNila stretched out one hand, her flames consuming a horse and rider\nheading straight toward her. Startled by her own precision, she turned and\nrepeated the gesture, searing through another Kez dragoon.\n“A sword!” Olem yelled, though one of his arms hung uselessly at his\nside. He caught a weapon tossed by one of his cuirassiers and spun to\ndeflect the swing of a Kez dragoon. The dragoon roared past and spun to\ncharge forward again, intent on plowing Olem beneath the hooves of his\nmount, but one of Nila’s bodyguards came at him from behind, slicing\nneatly through the base of his neck.\nNila helped Olem get back to his feet.\n“Ignore me,” he said. “Keep up the fire!”\nShe flung a ball of flame the size of an ox, consuming the closest Kez\ndragoon, and then felt a blackness touch the corner of her mind.\nFear seized her as the flames dancing on her fingertips went out.\nThe magebreaker.\nShe could sense his influence grow around her, and when she reached\nfor the Else once more, there was nothing to touch. Panic rose in her chest,\nthreatening to overwhelm her. She could not fight with a sword or shoot a\npistol. Her one strength was now gone.\nShe couldn’t pinpoint the location of the magebreaker. Her\npreternatural senses failing her completely, she threw herself back toward\nher horse, hauling herself into the saddle, knowing that her options were\nnow limited to fleeing.\nThere was a flash of lightning in the air behind her, and she turned in\ntime to hear two large explosions somewhere in the fog. She had forgotten\nabout Bo. If the magebreaker was here, if she could keep him distracted,\nmaybe Bo would be able to end this single-handed.\nA man screamed out of the fog astride the biggest, fastest horse she’d\never seen. He was clothed in black furs and brown leather, swinging an\nimmense, curved sword. He galloped toward her, blade flashing through the\nthroat of one of Nila’s bodyguards, and then he was past.\nNila raised her hands, only to remember she had no sorcery to throw at\nhim. “He’s going for Bo!” she shouted. “After him!”\nNot stopping to see if Olem’s cuirassiers were following, she urged her\nmount toward where she’d seen the flashes of sorcery.\nThe Kez camp was now a field of bodies of the dead and the wounded,\nKez and Adran alike.

Horses galloped through the fog riderless, and\nunseated cuirassiers and dragoons stumbled about, locking in combat when\nthey came across one another.\nNila felt completely vulnerable in the fog and suddenly realized again\nhow helpless she was. Should she try to help Bo now? Or would she just get\nherself killed?\nIt was too late to wonder. She came out of the densest fog and upon a\nstring of sorcery-made corpses. Horses and men alike lay dead, murdered\nby spikes of dripping ice.\nShe saw Bo, still astride his horse, reins in his teeth to leave both\nhands free, frost clinging to his sideburns. He twisted in his saddle toward a\ncharging group of Kez dragoons, and wind slammed into the lot of them,\nsending horses and men tumbling and screaming, carried off into the\nswirling mist.\nSomething moved in the fog behind Bo. At first she thought it was a\nriderless horse, running terrified and confused. But the creature stalked\nforward with an implacable gait and the shadow became something more\nlike a man. It was large and twisted, fury etched on its mangled face as it\ncrept up behind him. She had only seen Wardens from a distance. Close up,\nit was all the more terrifying.\n“Bo!” Nila shouted.\nBo swung around as the Warden leapt. His fingers twitched, and the\ncreature was suddenly impaled upon icicles as long as spears. The Warden\nsnapped the icicles off at its chest, blood and water dripping behind it as it\nloped forward, seemingly unaffected. Bo’s fingers twitched again and the\ncreature was thrown backward as easily as a leaf, screaming angrily into the\ngust of sorcery-fueled wind.\nIt managed to land on its feet, and Nila waited for Bo to finish the\ncreature off as it resumed its charge toward him. But his attention was\ngrabbed by the sudden arrival of more Kez dragoons. They raced toward\nhim from the side, only for their horses to stumble against his sorcery. Bo\nswayed in the saddle, looking like he was ready to fall at any moment. He\nwas too tired to continue this fight, and she could sense the dark presence of\nthe magebreaker. Any second now Bo wouldn’t be able to use his sorcery at\nall.\nNila snatched at a rock on the ground and flung it at the charging\nWarden. The rock skipped off its shoulder and it skidded to a halt, its\nmassive misshapen head turning toward her. Her breath caught in her throat\nat the sight of its malevolent, beady eyes. The Warden bellowed and\ncharged straight at her, head lowered like an angry bull.\nNila backed up, then turned to run. What could she do? The creature\nwould tear her limb from limb. It would kill her and then it would kill Bo,\nand all she had fought for would be for nothing. The sound of its heavy\nfootsteps pounded behind her and she spun to meet her death face-on.\nPanic, anger, and desperation snatched at the Else through the ribbon\nof darkness that was the magebreaker’s influence.

Nila tugged at the Else,\nforcing the tiniest blast of fire into the world and shoving it like a spike\nthrough the Warden’s eye.\nThe Warden stumbled and fell, a smoking black hole through its head.\nNila’s breath was dashed from her as she was suddenly flung to the\nground. She hit hard, rolling to absorb the impact but feeling her arm twist\nunnaturally beneath her. The magebreaker charged past her, sweeping\ntoward Bo. Bo raised his hands, face twisted in anger, but his sorcery\nsputtered and failed and only his sudden jerk at the reins carried him out of\nthe way of the magebreaker’s heavy scimitar. The Gurlish rider disappeared\ninto the fog.\nNila struggled to her feet, checking her arm, thankful that it was not\nbroken, and ran toward Bo. “Quick,” she said. “We have to go. We can’t\nfight him.”\nBo seemed to agree. He urged his horse toward her, reaching out one\nhand.\nOut of the corner of her eye, Nila saw the magebreaker’s charge. The\nGurlish Wolf was pounding straight for her on his charger, his scimitar\nswinging, and she could do nothing about it. She opened her mouth to\nscream.\nBo’s horse hit the bigger Gurlish stallion on the shoulder. Both horses\nbucked and reared, throwing their riders and flailing and neighing in panic.\nNila ran toward Bo as he struggled to sit up. She could see his\nprosthetic still in the stirrup, and as he tried to roll onto his front, the\nmagebreaker had already regained his footing and was sprinting toward Bo,\nsword at the ready.\nNila felt the tears in the corners of her eyes. She strained at the\nblackness that cut her off from her sorcery, reaching through the inky\ndepths for the Else. She had pushed through it once and she had to do it\nagain.\nIt was there. She could feel it, seemingly just beyond her reach. She\nclawed for the Else and it felt as if it were there at her fingertips.\nThe magebreaker’s shirt burst into flames. He threw himself to the\nground, rolling to put them out, his face a mixture of confusion and rage.\nNila strode forward. The Else slipped from her fingers and she drew up,\ntrying desperately to reach it. The magebreaker whirled on her now, sword\nheld in both hands, and she scrambled to recover the Else.\nShe threw herself out of the way of the first swipe. Flames sputtered in\nfront of her hands, singeing the magebreaker’s arms. It put him off long\nenough for her to scramble away, but in only a moment he was after her\nagain.\nOut of the corner of her eye she could see Bo crawling toward her,\nhelpless to stand without his leg, and his prosthetic still stuck in the stirrup.\nThe magebreaker swung, missing Nila’s face by inches. In her haste to\nget away she fell to the ground, trying to grab once more at the Else. It\nwould not come to her.

He writhed for a\nfew moments, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, and then did not stir.\nBo sat on the ground, good leg tangled in his empty pant leg, suit dirty\nand hair disheveled. “Pit, I hate gunpowder,” he said, tossing the smoking\npistol off to one side with a grunt. “Did you happen to see if that Warden\nwas missing a ring finger?”\nCHAPTER 42\n“T\nhis is suicide, you know.”\nTamas gave his brother-in-law a sidelong glance. Gavril had cleaned\nup quickly, and now wore a cuirassier’s coat with the stars of a lieutenant\ncolonel at his lapels. He’d taken the promotion without so much as a “thank\nyou,” and Tamas suspected that as soon as this was all over, Gavril would\ndisappear back to the Mountainwatch. “Your confidence is a little\nunderwhelming.”\n“It’s not that,” Gavril said, fixing a heavy saber to his belt. “I just think\nyou should have someone else lead the attack.”\nAdran mortars rained down on the city, and cannons hammered at the\nmain gate. It seemed that for every member of Ipille’s bodyguard that the\nmortars swept from the gate, two would cram themselves at the top, and\nTamas wondered if Ipille had an infinite number of them.\n“Are you worried about me?” Tamas said.\n“More worried about me. I’m not as lithe as I once was.”\n“You don’t have to come,” Tamas said.\n“If I let you die, Erika will come back and haunt me for the rest of my\ndays. I’m convinced of it.”\n“I didn’t know you were afraid of ghosts.”\nGavril shrugged. “Looks like the gate is not an original,” he said,\ngesturing toward the city.\nThe mighty blackwood doors that sealed the main gate of the city had\nsplintered under the withering cannon fire, and Tamas could see through the\nwreckage that the portcullis had fared little better. The ancient sorcery that\nprotected the wall had not, it seemed, been replaced when the doors had. He\ncould hear the artillery commander calling for heavier, slower shot to finish\nthe job. “As soon as that door is clear, we go,” Tamas said.\nAll around him his men were coming to the line, grouping by\ncompany, spurred on by the snares of their drummer boys. Officers on\nhorseback rode up and down those lines, yelling to their men, sabers\nwaving above them.\n“Breastplate!” Tamas said. A pair of boys ran to Tamas and fitted him\nwith a cuirassier breastplate. Another brought his horse, and then his\nhelmet, which Tamas took in place of his bicorne. “It’s been a long time\nsince I’ve stormed a city.”\nGavril nodded, looking on sourly. “I can’t remember the last time I\nsaw you wearing armor. Mine doesn’t fit anymore.”\nTamas jabbed a finger into Gavril’s stomach. “Lose some weight\nbefore the next campaign.” Truth be told, Tamas’s barely fit him. He wasn’t"

He wasn’t\nabout to let Gavril know.\n“I’m not coming to the next campaign.”\nPray to Adom that I’m not either, Tamas thought.\nThe boys finished their job and Tamas climbed onto his horse, then\nreached down for his ivory-handled pistols, which he thrust in his belt with\na thought for Taniel. The boys handed him his sword and carbine. “General\nArbor!”\nGeneral Arbor reined in beside Tamas, popping out his false teeth and\nstowing them in a saddlebag before snapping a salute. Arbor had ten years\non Tamas and was no powder mage, yet seemed twice as sprightly. Tamas\nwondered how he did it. “Yes sir! The boys are ready, sir,” he shouted\nabove the cannon fire.\n“Good.” He glanced toward Budwiel’s main gate. The door had been\nsmashed nearly to pieces after the latest attack, and the portcullis was a\nmangled jumble of metal. Ipille’s soldiers weren’t even trying to mend the\ngate. “Two minutes!”\nGavril climbed into his saddle and glanced down at Andriya. The\npowder mage held his bayoneted rifle in one hand, the other hand grasping\nhis belt casually. “Is he not riding?”\n“Horses don’t like me, and I don’t like them.” Andriya took a pinch of\npowder from his breast pocket and snorted it.\n“You could bathe,” Gavril suggested.\nAndriya touched his blood-crusted uniform and laughed.\n“He’ll keep up,” Tamas said.\n“If you say so. You, boy, give me the flag!”\nOne of the groomsmen ran forward with the Adran flag, a crimson\nbackground with the teardrop of the Adsea sitting before the mountains. He\nhanded it to Gavril.\n“Where’s Beon?” Tamas asked. “Andriya, do you know where Beon\nis?”\nAndriya gestured vaguely to the space behind Tamas’s command tent.\nStanding with a view of the battle, Ipille’s favorite son stood between two\nguards, his hat shading his eyes, jaw tight as he gazed at Budwiel. Tamas\nrode over to him.\n“Why am I here, Field Marshal?” Beon demanded. “What damned\ndeed do you have planned?”\n“What, you think I’m going to threaten you?”\nBeon did not respond.\n“Tell me truly,” Tamas said, “if I put you in a noose and told your\nfather to throw down his sword or I’d hang you, would he do it?”\n“No.”\n“I thought not. You’re here because your father’s royal guard will not\nsurrender unless ordered to by a member of the royal family.”\n“You think they would listen to me? You think I’d tell them to in the\nfirst place?” Beon demanded, chin raised.\n“They’ll listen to you if Ipille is dead.”\nBeon paled.\n“Or,” Tamas continued, “if he’s fled. If I win the day – if I truly take\nBudwiel and further fighting will do the Kez no good – I want you to tell"

Will you do that?”\nBeon didn’t answer.\nTamas tugged gently on his reins, edging his mount toward Beon.\n“This doesn’t have to be any bloodier than it will be. A fight through the\ncity, building to building, is not going to do anyone any good. If I fail,\nyou’ll likely be rescued and you can dance on my corpse.”\n“I’d rather not. I have more respect for you than that.”\n“I believe you.”\n“Very well, Field Marshal. If you clearly win the day, I will order them\nto stand down – though I can’t guarantee they’ll listen. But how long do\nyou have? How long until the Grand Army comes up behind you? It will\ntake you more than one assault to capture those walls.”\n“It better not,” Tamas muttered, nodding to the guard to take Beon\naway. He held his sword over his head and pointed it at General Arbor. The\ngeneral dismounted, true to his preference, as a boy took his horse away.\nArbor ran ahead of his infantry, shaking his sword and bellowing to his\nmen. They shouted back, bayonets thrusting in the air once, twice, three\ntimes.\nThe snares rolled out a beat and the ground shook beneath the feet of\nthe Adran army.\nSeventeen thousand infantry began the march toward Budwiel’s walls.\nLess than three minutes later they were within range of the few light cannon\nleft to the Kez, and Tamas watched the first rifts open in his columns. Not a\nman among them wavered, and they continued on, bayonets glimmering in\nthe sunlight.\n“That’s a beautiful sight,” Gavril said.\n“It is.”\n“Sir!” a voice yelled. It was Silvia, the artillery commander. “I need\nmore time. That portcullis will slow you down.”\n“You don’t have it,” Tamas said. “Make me an opening! I want a gap\nin that wall opened when my men are two hundred yards from it.”\nTamas expected her to argue, but she returned to her gun crews, a slew\nof curses and orders on her lips.\nTamas turned in the saddle. Behind him, three hundred cuirassiers\nstood ready in their stirrups. Breastplates were polished, helmets donned,\nand carbines loaded. Each of them was armed with a long lance to reach\nover the bayonets of the Kez infantry. Their horses wore breastplates and\nside skirts, the heaviest armor still used by the Adran army.\n“Men of the Thirty-Seventh!” he shouted. “That gate is the mouth of\nthe very pit itself. I’m riding through it. Are you with me?”\nA roar answered him as their swords were drawn and thumped against\ntheir breastplates in a terrible clamor. Tamas grinned at them. “Forward!”\nThe cuirassiers sheathed their swords and grasped their lances, and at\nTamas’s signal they rushed forward.

Everything he had\nhe now poured at the walls of Budwiel.\nHe prayed his men wouldn’t break.\nWith a sea of lances at his back, Tamas rode through the advancing\ncompanies of blue-uniformed Adran infantry. He kept his eyes on the spot\non the wall – the one he’d told Silvia about. His heart thumped with the\nbeat of the snare drums as the first cannonball suddenly slammed into one\nof the off-color stones. He counted the time in his head until the second ball\nhit, and then his heart lurched with the strike of the third.\nNothing happened. “Bloody pit!” he yelled.\nThe Kez on the walls lowered their muskets and he could see one of\ntheir officers stand up on the fortifications and raise his sword.\nOn the ground beside Tamas, Andriya kept pace with the horses with\nlittle apparent effort, his eyes gleaming from a powder trance. He\nshouldered his rifle in one smooth motion, not stopping even for a moment,\nand pulled the trigger. Tamas looked toward the walls, trying to see\nAndriya’s target – only to bark a laugh as the officer on the parapets\nplummeted to the ground.\nA cloud of smoke rose from the wall a few moments later as the royal\nguard opened fire. Rows of Adran soldiers went down beneath the volley.\nTamas drew closer and closer. A second series of cannonballs hit the\nwall in the weak section, and still nothing happened. His men neared the\nbase of the wall, the foremost companies much depleted, and he could see\nthem preparing hooks and ladders for the assault. At the gate, the very last\nsplinters of the blackwood doors had been knocked asunder and the\nportcullis had been reduced to jagged edges. The entrance yawned like a\nmouth full of broken, black teeth. Tamas focused his gaze on that. This\nbattle was in motion, and for victory or ruin he could do nothing but ride\nforward with the tide.\nTamas threw his hands up as a sudden wind tore against him, snatching\nthe breath from his lungs. He sheathed his sword and raised his carbine,\nlooking for a Privileged upon the walls, but was startled to feel something\npush at him from the Else.\nWas this some kind of trick? Another of Ipille’s traps? Tamas opened\nhis third eye and immediately felt the shock travel through his fingertips\nand into his very core.\nThe array of colors in the Else that indicated the ancient wards holding\nthe wall together writhed. Like a carriage spring pulled into a straight line,\nthey seemed to grow taut, and then with a snap that nearly blew him out of\nhis saddle, the whole thing burst open.\nHe dropped his third eye, expecting to see the world in ruin, the wall a\npile of rubble and his infantry scattered, but no one seemed affected by the\nblast, and the wall was still whole.\n“Did you feel that?” he shouted to Gavril.\n“Feel what? You almost fell off your horse.”\nTamas picked out a few infantrymen whom he knew to be Knacked\nand noted that several had stumbled – one had even fallen. Whatever had"

Whatever had\njust happened, it had affected only those with sorcerous power. He looked\nto his side to see Andriya still keeping pace on foot, but the powder mage\nwas shaking his head like a confused animal.\nTamas’s attention was brought back to the wall as the next round of\nstraight shot pounded the ancient stone to dust. Green-and-tan-clad bodies\ntumbled from the heights, and chips of rock took down his soldiers on the\nfront lines. Without the sorcery to protect it, the wall was but porcelain to\nthe modern artillery. Silvia’s cannon all seemed to open on that one spot,\nand within seconds there was a rubble-strewn path through the wall.\nAdran infantry rushed the breach, and that was the last Tamas saw of\nhis front lines as the gatehouse loomed before him.\n“Set lances!” he bellowed.\nLances fell into place and a dozen cuirassiers streamed around him to\ntake point. Beside him, Gavril drew his sword, and as one, the whole\ncompany thundered through the shattered gate and into the maw of Kez\nbayonets beyond.\nTamas’s world became chaos. The sound of screaming horses mixed\nwith the frightened yells of men, and the clash of steel on steel filled his\nears. The first rank of Kez bayonets was down, but another moved forward\nto fill its place. The small courtyard beyond the gatehouse became a\nbutcher’s pit of bayonets and lances. He felt a bayonet slash at his\nbreastplate and turned to shoot a Kez soldier in the face with his carbine. In\none motion, Tamas holstered the carbine and drew his sword.\nA hole appeared in the wall of bayonets. Tamas urged his horse\nthrough and then turned against the Kez formation from the side. One Kez\nsoldier turned to face him, and another, and then another, and within\nmoments the Kez ranks were in disarray.\nTamas pressed forward – there were hundreds more cavalry behind\nhim and they wouldn’t do any good in the courtyard. With the bayonet line\nbroken he was able to push through in moments, and soon he was in the\nstreet.\nThe avenue behind the wall was jammed with Kez soldiers. They\nstreamed up to reinforce the walls, shoved forward to fill the gaps, and\ndozens were already charging toward him. He reached out with his senses\nand detonated powder among the front rank, blowing them to pieces, letting\nhis sorcery do the work.\nThere were too many, forced forward by the weight of their own\ncomrades behind them. Even with his sorcery and cavalry, they wouldn’t be\nable to make a big enough corridor for the infantry to follow.\n“Sir,” a cuirassier shouted, “our men are wavering!”\nTamas sheathed his sword. “Damn it! Gavril, give me the flag!”\nGavril paused to unlatch the flag from his saddle, his sword spattered\nwith gore. He threw it overhand and Tamas caught it, leaping from his\nhorse. “Andriya, make me a path!”"

He threw it overhand and Tamas caught it, leaping from his\nhorse. “Andriya, make me a path!”\nAndriya disemboweled a Kez infantryman and sprinted toward the\nnearest stairs up to the wall. His rifle was spent and probably useless,\ncovered in blood, and he used the bayonet as a spear as he battled his way\nup the stairs.\nTamas followed in his path, kicking the dead and dying off the stairs in\nAndriya’s wake. They entered the second floor of the gatehouse and fought\ntheir way through the soldiers within. A moment later they were out in the\nsun.\nThe scene took Tamas’s breath away. His thousands were churning\nforward, their bayonets bristling, and the tops of the walls swarmed with the\ngreen-on-tan coats of the Kez infantry. His men came over the wall in their\nhundreds, but he could see the ranks at the base of the wall wavering. His\nmen would break if they weren’t spurred on.\nTamas tore the Kez flag from its holder above the gates and flung it\nfrom the heights. It arched downward and toward the embattled armies like\na spear. He watched it fall until a Kez grenadier, easily twice his size,\ncharged at him with an indecipherable war cry. Tamas slammed the end of\nhis flagpole into the grenadier’s chin, toppling the Kez, before raising it\nhigh above his head and waving it. A shout resounded among the infantry\non the ground and he saw them surge forward with renewed vigor.\n“Take this!” Tamas said to an Adran infantryman as he climbed over\nthe wall. “Don’t let it drop while you still draw breath.”\n“Yes sir!”\nTamas leapt to the grenadier whom he had beaten down and grabbed\nthe man by the hair, dragging him backward into the second floor of the\ngatehouse.\n“Where’s Ipille?” Tamas shouted in Kez.\nThe grenadier spit in his face and drew his boot knife. Empowered by\nhis powder trance, Tamas lifted him bodily with one hand and snatched his\nwrist with the other, feeling the bones snap beneath his palm. He slammed\nthe grenadier into the wall hard enough to bring dust down from the rafters.\n“Where is your king?”\nThe grenadier screamed and swung a fist. Tamas caught it, twisting the\ngrenadier and tossing him down the gatehouse stairs. He ducked back out\ninto the sunlight to find the flag still waving and more of his men pouring\nover the wall.\nIt wouldn’t be enough.\n“Andriya, find out where Ipille is!” Tamas bounded back down the\nstairs and leapt into his saddle. “Lances!”\nMost of the cuirassiers had fought their way past the courtyard and\ninto the street. Tamas counted over a dozen empty saddles, but there were\nstill plenty on their mounts. Tamas fought his way to them, his eye on the\ncurrent of the fight. He watched the ebb and flow of the Kez infantry, an\nexperienced eye pulling the pattern out of the chaos.

Lances, wheel left!”\nOnly about a third of his cavalry still had their lances. They moved to\nthe middle of the formation while the rest took the sides, fighting off the\nadvancing infantry with their heavy sabers.\n“Charge!”\nThe whole group surged forward, slamming into the disorganized\ncrowd of infantry.

Their charge ground to a\nhalt after just a hundred paces, but Tamas could see that it was enough.\nThe breach farther on down the wall seethed with blue uniforms. His\nown infantry fought their way in, heavy grenadiers at the front. Tamas’s\ncharge had grabbed the Kez’s attention so that his men could take the\nopening, and like a dam that had formed a crack, the whole tide of the battle\nbroke.\nTamas felt a knock against his breastplate and suddenly his world\nturned upside down. He threw himself away from his falling horse, rolled\nbeneath the hooves of another, and struggled to his feet, numbness in one\nleg.\nHe raised his sword in time to fend off the stroke of a Kez officer. He\nparried twice and lunged forward for the kill, but his leg gave out beneath\nhim and he tumbled forward, the officer’s sword crashing against his\nhelmet. He raised his sword to fend off another thrust, but a bayonet erupted\nfrom the officer’s stomach and the body was thrust aside.\n“On your feet, sir!” Andriya snatched Tamas under the arm and helped\nhim up. “There’s more to kill!”\nTamas took the opportunity to check himself. A deep gash ran along\nhis left thigh – it would be a bad one – and his breastplate bore no fewer\nthan five deep scratches that would otherwise have seen him killed.\n“You move too slowly in that thing,” Andriya said.\n“That’s just because I’m getting old. The king?”\n“He’s holding court in the Kresim Cathedral. As far as these men\nknow, he’s still there.”\nTamas made his way through the fighting, shielded on one side by\nAndriya and by the avenue shops on the other. He limped to a high stoop\nand pulled himself up to survey the battle. It could still go either way –\nmore Kez poured in from the side streets and they still held key sections of\nthe wall. They would make Tamas’s men pay in blood for every inch.\nSeveral of Tamas’s cuirassiers, led by Gavril, found him on the stoop.\n“Can you ride?” Gavril asked.

Both he and his mount had taken a score of\ncuts, and his calf was soaked with blood, but he seemed ready to keep\nfighting.\n“I can.” Tamas extended his hand, and Gavril pulled him up into the\nsaddle behind him. “Kresim Cathedral,” Tamas shouted into Gavril’s ear.\n“We have to end this now!”\n“Up the main thoroughfare?”\n“No, take that street there.” Tamas pointed down the avenue to one of\nthe side streets that seemed to have emptied of all its Kez reinforcements.\nHe waved his sword. “Lances! To me!”\nThey had to fight through two half-built barricades as they made their\nway toward the center of the city, but it was clear that the barricades were\nnot properly manned, merely someplace for the Kez infantry to fall back to.\nTamas’s cavalry numbered less than thirty now, and every man who fell\nwould be one less he could use to storm Ipille’s final stand.\nThey emerged from one of the side streets into the cathedral plaza.\nWhile the Budwiel cathedral was not nearly as large as its recently\ndestroyed cousin in Adopest, it was still a breathtaking building. Four spires\nrose above the tallest buildings in the city, framing a bronze dome and\nmagnificent, fortresslike walls.\nThe plaza was empty. Tamas called a halt, sensing a trap.\nHe slid down from his spot behind Gavril and put a whole powder\ncharge into his mouth, letting it dissolve, paper and all, on his tongue. He\ndrew a pistol from his belt, checked to see if it was still loaded, and\ngestured for his men to proceed cautiously.\nTheir hoofbeats echoed like snares on the plaza flagstone, and the\nfighting at the wall seemed muted and distant now. Tamas had expected the\ntoughest resistance here, where Ipille would have centered his best and\nbravest men, but the cathedral seemed all but abandoned. Tamas swept it\nwith his third eye and there were no final Privileged or Knacked lying in\nwait.\n“Something’s not right,” Gavril said, his voice overly loud in the\nempty square.\nTamas checked his second pistol. His leg burned, even through his\ndeep powder trance, and he was forced to limp. “They may have fled.”\nThey approached the main doors. One of the pair of double doors was\nopen a crack. Tamas peeked through. He could see nothing but the stone\nwalls of the cathedral entrance hall. His men dismounted, securing their\nhorses, and Tamas nodded to Andriya. “Five men,” he said.\nAndriya called out names. The soldiers took position around the door,\nthen threw it open and leapt inside. Their feet echoed in the recesses of the\nbuilding as they charged through the entrance hall and into the nave. Tamas\nheld his breath, waiting for the crack of rifles and the shouts of fighting\nmen, his muscles tensed to lead the rest of his men inside.\nSilence.\n“The bastard ran,” Tamas said, shoving his pistol back into his belt.\n“Sounds like it,” Gavril agreed.\n“Didn’t even have the guts to tell his personal guard.” Tamas kicked"

He swore under his breath and\nlistened to the sound of his cuirassiers’ footsteps as they cleared the room\ninside. “Let’s go.”\nHe limped into the entrance hall only to come within a pace of\ncolliding with Andriya.\n“Sir,” Andriya said, his face pale. “You should see this.”\nTamas exchanged a glance with Gavril. Anything that had Andriya\nworried couldn’t be good.\nHe saw the first body as he came around the corner. One of Ipille’s\nelite – green-on-tan uniform with gilded trim and a gray undercoat. The\nwoman’s sword was half-drawn, and she’d been shot in the heart from close\nrange. The next two bodies were mere feet apart, two more of Ipille’s elite\nlocked in battle, knives buried in each other.\nTamas entered the nave, his eyes brushing past the immense columns\nthat marched down the center of the room to hold the dome aloft, looking at\nthe battlefield lain out before him. Well over a hundred of Ipille’s elite lay\ndead or dying. He even caught sight of two dead Wardens. He opened his\nthird eye, but there wasn’t a hint of sorcery in the room.\n“What the pit happened?” Gavril said.\nTamas pointed toward the front of the nave. “I bet he knows.”\nUsing his sheathed sword as a cane, with one pistol in his other hand,\nTamas limped his way toward the Diocel’s chair at the front of the room. In\nthe chair sat Ipille, his immense bulk overflowing the armrests. He was\npinned in place by a small sword with a jeweled hilt, and the marble floor\naround the chair was slick with his blood. At the foot of the dais sat a\nhaggard-looking man in his early forties, chin in hand, staring blankly at\nTamas.\nHe wore the uniform of a Kez general, and his resemblance to the fat\ncorpse in the chair was plain. After all, he was Ipille’s oldest son.\nThe prince stood as Tamas drew near, and presented his sword hilt-\nfirst. Tamas came to a halt and gazed at the sword. He suddenly felt very\ntired. “Florian je Ipille. It appears you have committed a coup.”\nFlorian seemed to flinch away from the corpse just over his shoulder.\n“I have done my duty as the crown prince. I have freed my people of a war\nthey could not win. On behalf of the Kez nation, I surrender my sword to\nField Marshal Tamas.”\nTamas put away his pistol and took Florian’s sword, holding it up to\nthe light. “This is Ipille’s sword.”\n“It is the king’s sword. I am now king.”\nTamas wondered what Kez law would say to that. Or Florian’s younger\nbrother, Beon. He wasn’t familiar with the finer points of Kez succession,\nespecially when it came to coups.

But that wasn’t Tamas’s concern. “You ask for terms?”\n“That the Kez people be treated fairly in a court of their sister nations.\nThat Adro and Deliv immediately cease their attacks on the Kez army, both\nwithin and without our borders.”\n“I have two immediate conditions for your surrender, in addition to\nthose that will come later.”\n“Name them.”\n“That you order your men to stand down.”\n“Lororlia!” Florian shouted. “Are you still alive?” A figure emerged\nfrom the recesses of the nave, a Kez woman with black hair and hawkish\neyes, wearing the uniform of a Kez colonel. She walked with a pronounced\nlimp and clutched at her arm.\n“Yes, my lord?”\n“Send word to our officers. Our men are to stand down at once.”\nLororlia looked to Tamas and he thought he saw a spark of defiance\nthere. “Yes, my lord.” She limped off.\nTamas turned to Gavril. “Send one of our cuirassiers back to the front.\nTell our men to accept the surrender of the Kez immediately and to\nwithdraw outside the city walls – all except the infantry of the Seventh.\nThey’re to begin the disarmament of the Kez army.” Tamas glanced at\nFlorian and saw a smile at the corner of his lips. He suspected that there\nwas more to this coup than a means to end the war. “And,” he added in a\nlowered voice, “get Beon somewhere safe. Put him under heavy guard. I\ndon’t want him getting a knife in the back. Pit, you better go yourself.”\nGavril strode from the room, taking several of the cuirassiers with him.\n“What else?” Florian asked.\n“Surrender the body of the god Kresimir.”\nFlorian’s eyebrows went up. “Bah. It’s in the Diocel’s chambers over\nthere. Take it. He has brought us nothing but sorrow.”\n“Secure that body, Andriya,” Tamas ordered. “Don’t touch it.”\n“Is that all?”\nTamas straightened and held Florian’s sword at arm’s length. “Florian\nje Ipille, I accept your surrender on behalf of the Adran and Deliv alliance.\nMay Adom smile upon the end of this bloody war.”\nCHAPTER 43\nT\naniel and Vlora each rode three horses to collapsing as they followed the\nBrudanian Privileged up the Counter’s Road and east toward Adopest.\nThey ate up the miles, and Taniel knew they must be gaining on their\nquarry as they drew closer and closer to the city. His body shuddered from\nexhaustion, while his mind was a chaotic knot of fear, anger, and hope.\nThere were not many miles left, and if Adopest was in the hands of the\nBrudanians as Vlora had said, they needed to catch up to Ka-poel and her\ncaptors before they entered the city.\nThey continued on, no words between them, until they rode over a hill\nand saw Adopest resting on the tip of the Adsea in the distance.

Taniel’s\nmind buzzed from a powder trance, his body sagging beneath days without\nsleep.\nThey had had to leave Gavril and Norrine behind. Gavril had gone\nsouth to try to warn Tamas about the Brudanian trickery, while Norrine had\nstayed with their couple of wounded to oversee the Brudanian prisoners.\nTaniel had not wanted to abandon her, but he knew that he and Vlora would\ntravel the fastest alone.\n“There,” Vlora said.\nTaniel shook his head to clear his vision and focused on a party just\noutside the city limits. There were nine riders, and even at a distance he\ncould tell by the overcoat, hat, and small frame that one was Ka-poel. They\nleft a dust cloud behind them as they hurried for the anonymous streets of\nthe city, and Taniel’s hopes of catching them before they reached the city\nwalls were dashed.\nHe did not reply to Vlora, but leaned over the neck of his horse, urging\nit forward.\nThey reached the edge of High Talien on Adopest’s west side less than\nan hour later. Taniel could feel panic rising in his chest as the midmorning\ncrowds closed in around him, his horse foaming at the mouth, sides\nshuddering. The Brudanians were gone, and along with them the chances of\ngetting Ka-poel back.\n“Taniel.” He heard Vlora’s voice as if far in the distance. “Taniel, we\nwon’t find them now.”\nHe whirled on her. “I will. I will find them, the bastards. If I have to\nkill every Brudanian I cross, I will get Ka-poel back.”\n“Well, you’re going to have a good start of it.”\nTaniel’s mouth opened but he could find no reply. People were staring\nat them and their near-dead horses. He followed Vlora’s gaze off to his left.\nBrudanian soldiers flooded onto the street ahead of them, shouting and\npointing.\n“Leave the horses,” Taniel said, sliding from his saddle. He untied his\nsaddlebags and threw them over his shoulder, taking his pistols and rifle,\nwhile Vlora did the same.\nThey slipped down a nearby alleyway, abandoning their horses and\nmoving over to the next street. Taniel could see the soldiers flanking them,\nmoving to keep up and spreading out up ahead. He put one hand on his\npistol, ready to draw.\n“We shouldn’t have a running fight here,” Vlora warned. “Too many\npeople.”\n“To the pit with the people. I’ll take first blood if they come any\ncloser.” Taniel knew they had to get out of there. Vlora was right. A fight in\nthe middle of the city would just attract more attention and draw in more\nsoldiers. There’d be no backup. Adopest was now hostile territory. If the\nsoldiers goaded them into a fight, they would no doubt bring in a Privileged\nsooner rather than later.\nTaniel had fought a Privileged in Adopest before. It was less than\npleasant."

It was less than\npleasant.\n“You recognize this part of town?” Vlora said.\n“We’re near Hrusch Avenue, aren’t we?”\n“It’s our old haunt.”\n“I didn’t spend a lot of time in the streets,” Taniel said.\n“I did,” Vlora answered. “And under them. There’s an old bathhouse\nup ahead. We might be able to slip into the storm drains.”\nThey crossed two more streets, watching warily as the soldiers\ncontinued to flank them while keeping their distance.\n“What are they waiting for?” Vlora asked.\nTaniel had just been wondering the same thing. They had the numbers.\nEven if Vlora detonated all of their powder – and she wouldn’t, not with all\nthe people around – she might miss a few and they would close in with\nbayonets and swords, or worse – some of them might have air rifles.\nThe old bathhouse was a ruin of a three-story building at the end of the\nstreet. The doors and windows were boarded up, with signs telling the local\nchildren it was a dangerous place to play. Taniel spotted a Brudanian\nuniform up ahead of them.\n“They’ve gotten in front of us,” he growled.\n“Not only that.” Vlora’s face had gone pale. She didn’t have to finish\nher sentence. Taniel could sense the Privileged moving in on their position,\none behind and one ahead of them. That was what the soldiers were waiting\nfor. How the pit had they gotten two Privileged here so quickly? Either he\nand Vlora had been insanely unlucky, or the Brudanian commander had\ncounted on needing reinforcements when Ka-poel’s kidnappers returned.\n“Quickly!” he said.\nThey headed around to an alley running behind the bathhouse. Taniel\nthrust his bayonet beneath the board barring the back door and wrenched it\naway.\nThere was a crack of a musket and Taniel flinched away from where a\nbullet struck the wall beside him. He ripped off another board as Vlora\nsqueezed off a shot, dropping the soldier at the head of the alley. Taniel\nslammed his shoulder against the locked door, bursting it in two heavy hits,\nand they rushed inside.\n“The Privileged are getting close,” Vlora said.\n“I know! Where’s the damned storm drain?”\n“In the basement. Down the hall. Go, go!”\nTaniel sprinted down the dark, damp hall of the bathhouse and past the\nshadowed, sludge-filled baths. A voice called out behind them in accented\nAdran.\n“Adran soldiers, surrender now!”\nTaniel slowed, pushing Vlora on ahead of him, and brought up his\nrifle. He waited in the darkness of a doorway for a soldier to put his head\ninto the back door of the bathhouse.\nHis bullet took the man between the eyes. There was shouting, and\nTaniel felt the pressure of sorcery being pulled into this world. He sprinted\nafter Vlora, following her down the steps and into the blackness of the\nbasement.

He\nfound Vlora in the farthest room from the stairs. She had pried the grate\naway from the storm drain and tossed her own saddlebags down the hole.\nTaniel could hear footsteps pounding along the floor above them.\n“Why haven’t the Privileged attacked yet?” he demanded.\n“Quiet!” she said. “Go, now!” He sensed her reach out toward the\nsoldiers’ powder, detonating a few choice charges to sow confusion. The\nsound of the explosions echoed through the building.\nTaniel climbed into the storm drain, his hands slipping on the rusted\nladder bolted to the walls of the drain. He lowered himself down until his\nfeet touched water and then let himself drop the last foot to the drain floor.\n“Come on!” he called back up to Vlora.\nVlora stood above the storm drain, her head tilted as if listening for\nsomething. “Wait,” she said quietly. “There’s something…”\nHer words were cut off by a sudden trembling. Taniel threw his hand\nabove his head, his heart leaping into his throat as he heard the foundation\nof the building give a deafening crack. There was a strangled scream above\nhim. He choked on dust, wiping water from his face.\n“Quick!” he yelled.\nHis voice no longer echoed. Peering up through the gloom, he saw\nnothing but stone above him.\nThe building had collapsed on Vlora.\nCHAPTER 44\nA\ndamat accompanied Police Commissioner Hewi and six officers to arrest\nLady Cheris.\nHers was a beautiful manor on the outskirts of the Routs in Adopest,\nnot far from Ondraus the Reeve’s home. It stood three stories tall and\noverlooked one of the largest private gardens in the city. Adamat waited in\nthe foyer, allowing the cool autumn air to blow over him from the open\ndoor while a pair of constables spoke with the butler.\n“This is most unusual,” the butler said, raising his voice. “Lady Cheris\nis an upstanding member of society and will not be treated like a common\ncriminal.”\nCommissioner Hewi cleared her throat, interrupting a response from\none of her constables. “My good man, I am the commissioner of the Adran\npolice force. My presence here clearly indicates that Lady Cheris is a most\nuncommon criminal. Now, tell me where she is, or you’ll spend the next six\nmonths in Sablethorn.”\nThe butler looked as if he would protest further, but a glance at the\nstone-faced constables seemed to convince him otherwise. He appeared to\ndeflate. “She’s in the sitting room. But Commissioner, she has guests.\nSurely this could wait for another time.”\nHewi moved the man to one side with her cane and strode past him.\nAdamat followed.\nA constable opened the door to the sitting room and Hewi walked in as\nif she owned the home. Two men sat in armchairs by the windows, while\nthe two sofas were occupied by four women, one of whom was Lady\nCheris. Their conversation stopped midstride and they all looked in surprise\nat Commissioner Hewi, while Adamat stood in the corner with his hat in\none hand."

Their conversation stopped midstride and they all looked in surprise\nat Commissioner Hewi, while Adamat stood in the corner with his hat in\none hand.\nThis particular arrest was one that he had no interest in doing himself.\nEverything, including Ricard’s own word, indicated that Lady Cheris would\nbe as hard to pin down as an eel.\n“Commissioner Hewi!” Lady Cheris said, standing. “I wasn’t\nexpecting you today. May I introduce Lord Elmore of the Novi National\nBank? I believe you know everyone else in the room.”\n“Charmed, Lord Elmore. Lady Cheris. Would you like to do this here,\nor see your guests out first?”\nCheris’s face clouded and she blinked rapidly. “Whatever could you\nmean?”\nAdamat cleared his throat and glanced significantly at the constables\nguarding the door, though he knew Cheris was only playing the fool.\n“Ah.” Cheris swallowed hard. “Lord Elmore. My friends. Would you\nbe willing to resume this conversation tomorrow?”\nThe gentlemen and ladies all stood and Lord Elmore shook Cheris’s\nhand while casting dark glances at the commissioner. “Of course. Please let\nus know if there’s anything we can do for you.” They filed out the door and\nAdamat listened to be sure they had left the house. Once they were gone,\nLady Cheris dropped onto one of the sofas.\n“What is this all about, Hewi?” she asked.\n“That’s ‘Commissioner,’ my lady. And please remain standing. You\nare under arrest for the attempted murder of Ricard Tumblar. We can\ndispense with the wrist irons, I think, as long as you’ll come along\nwillingly.”\nCheris’s nostrils flared. “Attempted murder? I nearly died in that\nbombing! What are you talking about?”\n“We have strong reason to believe you masterminded the bombing of\nthe headquarters of the Holy Warriors of Labor.”\nStronger reason than even Hewi would let on, Adamat reflected. Denni\nof Rhodigas had confessed in front of Commissioner Hewi’s Knacked – the\none who could determine a liar upon hearing. Lady Cheris had personally\nhired him for the job.\n“Me? My arm was broken by a falling beam!” Cheris waggled the\nelbow of the arm she still held in a sling. “You have a damned lot of gall to\naccuse me of such things.”\nHewi sighed. “We have ample evidence, my lady.”\n“Evidence? What evidence? There’s nothing at all to tie me to such a\ncrime! I was about to have dinner with Ricard tonight. Do you think I’d\ndine with a man I tried to kill? You, sir. Inspector Adamat, wasn’t it? You’re\nfriends with Ricard. Does he think I’ve done such a thing?”\nAdamat glanced at Hewi, who gave him the most imperceptible of\nnods. “He does, madam. As do I.”\nCheris stood up straight. “I demand that you tell me the evidence you\nclaim you hold against me.”\nAdamat scoffed. Surely she didn’t think they would?\n“I can’t do that, my lady,” Hewi said.\n“Can’t? Or won’t? Because you don’t have a damned thing. If you did,"

Hah! As if I’d have anything to do with him. I hope\nyou have something better than that.”\n“Transfer of funds amounting to one hundred and twenty-thousand\nkrana from your personal account to an account belonging to Denni of\nRhodigas,” Adamat cut in. “We’ve already arrested and questioned your\npersonal banker.”\nCheris’s mouth hung open for a moment, then she said quietly, “Those\naccounts are not open to government purview, nor are they admissible in\ncourt.”\n“They are now,” Adamat said. “The law was passed a month ago. For\nthe head of the bankers’ union, I’m surprised you weren’t aware of that.\nCommissioner?”\nHewi oversaw the arrest as Cheris was led out the side door by one of\nhis constables and put into an unmarked police carriage. Adamat waited\nbeside the carriage for the commissioner to join him. “Thank you for\ncoming, ma’am,” he said to Hewi.\n“No, thank you, Inspector. If I had a thousand more officers prowling\nthe city right now, I’d still be short. My people couldn’t possibly have\ntracked all of this down. You really are one of the best.”\n“That’s good of you to say, ma’am. And that law I mentioned…”\n“It should be on the books by now. Backdated, of course. Not\nsomething I’d normally do, but after running Denni past our lie-Knack we\nhave to cover our evidence.”\n“Thank you, ma’am.”\n“You sure you want to ride with her?” Hewi asked.\n“Yes. It’s best I question her in private.”\n“Nothing official can come out of it.”\n“Of course. For my own personal peace of mind.”\nAdamat said farewell to the commissioner and climbed into the\ncarriage, where Cheris sat looking out the opposite window. Her façade of a\nbaffled, outraged businesswoman had dropped to leave behind someone\nwho looked tired and vaguely annoyed. The carriage began to move and\nAdamat took several minutes to examine her before he spoke.\n“Why?” Adamat asked.\nCheris glanced over as if noticing his presence in the carriage for the\nfirst time. “Because Ricard’s an idiot,” she said. “And you can tell him I\nsaid so. He’s a visionary, for certain, and that does give him something\nextra. But he’s a fool and he’ll be a terrible First Minister.”\n“So you admit it?”\n“Sounds like you already know the truth, so I might as well.” She"

But he’s a fool and he’ll be a terrible First Minister.”\n“So you admit it?”\n“Sounds like you already know the truth, so I might as well.” She\nsighed. “My resources have been stretched thin, Inspector. Having to rely\non people like Denni makes my stomach turn. And you better believe that\nmy banker will never work anywhere in the Nine again in his life.”\n“You think you’ll still have that kind of power after this comes out?”\n“My involvement will be forgotten in a year. Denni will go to the\nguillotine and I’ll pay a heavy fine and lose my position in the union, but\nI’ll climb back on top.”\n“And make your enemies suffer, I suppose?”\n“I’m not normally a murderer, Inspector. I don’t kill or maim unless\nI’m running out of options. But yes, I’ll make them suffer. I’ll destroy\nreputations if it suits me. You should know that if you’ve been investigating\nme.”\nAdamat’s investigation had been a whirlwind that lasted only half a\ndozen hours between the time he took Denni in and the time he arrived at\nCheris’s door. He grunted a reply.\n“In fact,” Cheris added, “I’m amazed you’d allow me the knowledge\nof your involvement.”\n“I’ve dealt with worse.” Adamat felt a bit of doubt in the back of his\nmind and wondered if this had been a good idea. Perhaps the\ncommissioner’s warning had held some meaning Adamat had missed.\nNothing indicated that Cheris was the kind of monster that Vetas had been,\nbut perhaps he should have taken precautions.\nA knowing smile appeared at the corner of Cheris’s mouth. Adamat\nnarrowed his eyes, wondering if Cheris knew about Lord Vetas. Perhaps she\ndid. With her relationship with Ricard, it was not out of the realm of\npossibility.\nThey rode into Elections Square and watched the black spike of\nSablethorn Prison grow larger over their heads. The prison was full of\ndissidents and particularly loud royalists, but the guards had made room in\none of the nicer cells for Cheris. Ricard had insisted upon that, though\nAdamat didn’t know the reason. Sentiment, perhaps?\nCheris was escorted from the carriage. Adamat stepped out, wondering\nif he would now need to extend the length of SouSmith’s contract, and\nwatched her be led toward Sablethorn’s doors. Cheris turned suddenly and\nlooked back, throwing him a menacing smile.\n“Have a good few weeks, Inspector. I’ll see you soon.”\nThe residence of Adro’s former Arch-Diocel of the Kresimir Church,\nCharlemund, seemed bleak and bare.\nAdamat remembered his first visit to the grounds. The vineyards had\nbeen full of workers, while horses practiced on the racetrack.

His art collections would be sold off to\nprivate collectors or donated to the city museum. The building itself might\nbe bought up by a wealthy merchant – Adamat had even heard Ricard\nexpress interest – or perhaps torn down and the stone recycled to help in the\nrebuilding of the city center.\n“What you looking for?” SouSmith asked.\nAdamat smoothed the front of his jacket. “I’m trying to find out what\nkind of man doesn’t leave a shadow,” he said.\nAdamat showed his papers at a temporary guardhouse a few hundred\nyards from the manor and was waved on. At the front door, he remembered\nhis second visit to the manor: during the battle in which Tamas fought and\ncaptured Charlemund. The burned-out remnants of a carriage still lay beside\nthe gravel drive, and there were still muddy furrows where Privileged\nsorcery had dug up the ground.\nAt the front door another pair of watchmen lounged on the stoop, a\ngame of dice between them. They stood as Adamat left his carriage and\napproached, with SouSmith behind him.\n“They said that you would have a key,” Adamat said.\n“Right. We do,” one of the watchmen said. She was a young woman,\nno more than twenty-five, and she held a musket and wore the light blues of\nthe city police. “Papers?”\nAdamat presented his papers once more. “Did I see smoke coming\nfrom one of the chimneys?”\n“Probably,” the second watchman said, rubbing a thumb under the rim\nof his hat. He was an older fellow with gray in his mustache.\n“I didn’t know the manor was occupied.”\n“The state employs a few of the former staff in order to keep the\nbuilding tidy until they can get around to selling it,” the first watchman\nreplied, handing Adamat back his papers. “Don’t worry about them, they\nstay out of sight. The library is in the south wing, all the way at the end.\nHead inside, past the first staircase, and take a left. That hall dead-ends in\nthe library.”\n“Thank you very much,” Adamat said. He waited for them to unlock\nthe door and then slipped inside, followed by SouSmith.\nThe foyer still held evidence of the fight that had taken place there\nmany months previous. Someone had tidied up the mess Adamat\nremembered, but there was no hiding the chips in the marble from bullets,\nnor the empty pillar where a bust of Charlemund had once stood.\nSouSmith paused and gave a low whistle. “One man lived here?”\nAdamat had forgotten that SouSmith had never been allowed inside on\ntheir previous visit together. “Kind of off-putting, isn’t it?”\nSouSmith ran his thick thumb over a chip in the marble banister. “Nah.\nShould have gone into the clergy.”\nThey left the foyer and followed the watchman’s directions toward the\nlibrary.\n“You said Charlemund escaped,” SouSmith asked.\n“That’s what Ricard told me.”\n“Think he could be here?”\n“What? In hiding?”\n“Yeah.”\n“They’ve got watchmen and servants. He couldn’t go unnoticed.”"

He couldn’t go unnoticed.”\nSouSmith stopped suddenly and looked up and down the hallway. It\nwas over two hundred yards long, the ceilings twenty feet high, and had no\nless than thirty doors. He cocked an eyebrow at Adamat.\n“Okay, it’s big,” Adamat conceded. “But Charlemund is… well…\nyou’ve met him. He’s used to command. To luxury. I don’t think he could\n‘hide’ anywhere if his life depended on it. My best guess is he’s already fled\nto Kez or Novi or someplace farther. We’ll hear about him sooner rather\nthan later.”\nTheir voices carried as they spoke, giving the place a strange echo and\nsending a chill up Adamat’s spine, which he attributed to the autumn cold.\nThe hallway ended in a pair of closed double doors. Adamat jiggled\none handle, finding it unlocked, and pulled. The room inside took his breath\naway.\nCharlemund’s library was a rectangular room several times larger than\nAdamat’s house. Books lined every wall, sorted neatly on cherry\nbookshelves. There were wooden ladders on runners to reach the high\nshelves, and each corner had an iron spiral staircase to reach the second\nfloor. There was a grand, marble-trimmed fireplace at either end of the\nroom.\nThere weren’t as many books here as there were in the Public Archives\nor the university library, but this collection was nearly as big as, if not\nbigger than, the late king’s library. It baffled Adamat how one man could\nhave acquired so many books. Charlemund had been far from a “man of\nlearning.”\n“I don’t have any bloody idea where to start.”\nSouSmith grunted and threw himself down into one of the leather\nwingback chairs by the cold fireplace closest to the door. “Wake me when\nyou’re done,” he said.\n“You’re no help at all.”\nBy the time Adamat had a grasp of Charlemund’s indexing methods,\nSouSmith was already snoring loudly.\nUskan had sent him a list of a dozen books that might be of some\ninterest. Adamat started with those, finding them and pulling them down,\nstacking them on a table in the middle of the library. When he had collected\nthem all, he began to skim each book quickly, casting each page to memory\nin order to examine it more closely later, all while looking for words like\n“shadow” and “shade.”\nHe finished with the first dozen books by one o’clock and returned,\nsomewhat on edge, to the rest of the library.\nAdamat’s Knack allowed him to move through the library at what most\nwould find a startling speed. To him, it was frustratingly slow. The library\nwas sorted according to the name of the author, which was very little help.\nHe was forced to look for titles that stood out as religious books, or for\nauthors he recognized as scholars. He took down another stack of a dozen\nbooks and began to run through those.\nHe was on his third stack of books by four o’clock. SouSmith had\nawoken and fallen asleep again, and the lengthening shadows told Adamat\nhe wouldn’t have much more time to read by daylight."

SouSmith had\nawoken and fallen asleep again, and the lengthening shadows told Adamat\nhe wouldn’t have much more time to read by daylight.\n“SouSmith,” he said, shaking the boxer’s shoulder.\nSouSmith opened one eye. “Eh?”\n“Do you have a match? I need to light the lanterns. Or a fire, or\nsomething.”\n“Nope.” His eye closed.\nAdamat sighed. SouSmith wasn’t going to be a lot of help here.\nAdamat still had him working as a bodyguard for another week, but the real\ndanger had passed, and SouSmith knew it. He also knew that Ricard was\nfooting the bill. Adamat couldn’t bring himself to blame SouSmith for\nslacking off.\n“I’m going to find one of the servants,” he announced.\nSouSmith grunted.\nAdamat remembered that the smoke had been coming from a chimney\nin the north wing. He envisioned the house in his mind’s eye, remembering\nhis brief inspection after the battle with Charlemund. The north wing had a\nballroom, an observatory, the dining room, the kitchens, and the servants’\nquarters.\nThat was his best chance for a match. Maybe they’d even light the\nlibrary fireplace for him.\nHe gathered his hat and cane and headed down the main hallway. He\nclimbed the foyer stairs and continued down the main hall on the second\nfloor, where he came to the servants’ quarters. This part of the house was\nwarmer, and he found himself looking forward to the heat of a fireplace.\nThe autumn chill was more pronounced in this place than he’d expected.\nHe knocked on several of the servants’ doors, but received no answer.\nThree of the doors were unlocked, and inside he found evidence of\nhabitation, but there were no servants present.\nFrustrated, he took the servants’ stairs down toward the kitchens. Back\non the first floor, he could hear the sound of voices. Finally!\nHe entered the kitchen from the back. It was an immense room, some\nthirty paces across, and he was startled to find it rather well stocked, despite\nthe skeleton crew of servants. Herbs hung from the ceiling, there was\ncanned meat on the shelves – dusted, no less – and sacks of grain\nunmolested by rodents. A figure at the opposite end of the room, wearing a\nwhite apron and a tall white hat, was singing to himself in front of the only\nlit oven.\n“Excuse me,” Adamat called.\nThe figure turned, giving Adamat a good look at his profile, and\nAdamat’s feet suddenly felt like lead. He grabbed his cane in both hands\nand twisted it to draw his sword. His mouth was dry, and he pointed the tip\nof his sword at the fugitive Arch-Diocel, Charlemund.\n“You,” Adamat hissed.\nCharlemund’s eyebrows rose. His apron was covered in flour, and his\nhands full of bread dough. “Uh, yes?”\nAdamat’s mouth moved, but he wasn’t exactly sure what he wanted to\nsay. The Arch-Diocel was a national traitor and a villain, and he had\nwounded Adamat twice in their last encounter. But he didn’t appear to be\narmed.

Keep your hands where I can\nsee them.”\n“Fine.” Slowly, Charlemund began to knead the dough between his\nfingers.\n“Stop that.”\n“I’d rather not ruin this loaf,” Charlemund said.\n“I don’t give a damn!” The words came out a shout. Sweat poured\ndown the small of Adamat’s back.\nCharlemund squinted at him, but he didn’t stop kneading the dough.\n“Have we met?”\n“What kind of a question is that? We have met on several occasions.”\nAdamat’s heart hammered in his chest, but his annoyance was beginning to\novercome his nervousness. This was Charlemund, was it not? He had put on\nperhaps two stone since their last meeting – an awfully large amount in just\na few months – but otherwise it was the same man. Unless Charlemund had\nemployed a relative in his kitchens?\nAnd had he been singing to himself earlier?\nCharlemund seemed to grow thoughtful, and his eyes focused on\nsomething over Adamat’s shoulder. “Oh, that’s right. We have met.” He\ngrimaced. “Not on the best of terms with this body, though. I really do\napologize. Let me help you.”\n“Help me?”\n“With your search. You’re looking for a book. I think The\nCompendium of Gods and Saints should be the right thing. Mostly\nsuperstition and rubbish, but it answers your question. It’s back in the\nlibrary, northwest corner. About three feet from SouSmith’s elbow,\nactually.”\nAdamat felt his sword arm waver. “How could you possibly know any\nof that?”\nCharlemund grinned. “Just trying to be a good host. Can I offer you\nsomething?”\n“Offer me what?”\n“Something to eat. I made some squash soup last night. I may have\nleftovers.”\nTamas stood atop the blasted ruins of the walls of Budwiel with the\nnoonday sun in his face. His body ached and his leg throbbed, skin feeling\ntight against the stitches. A slash along his cheek itched and he had to\nremind himself not to rub at it, or the damned thing would never heal.\nThe Deliv army approached, a snake of Kelly-green uniforms winding\ndown the highway and into the immense camp of Adran soldiers outside the\nwalls. Tamas’s men lined the highway in their parade uniforms as a sign of\nrespect for their Deliv allies. Sulem and his cabal rode at the head of his\narmy – Tamas could see their banners from this distance even without a\npowder trance – and he could hear the distant beat of their drums tapping\nout the march.\n“Sir.”\nTamas spared a glance for the young corporal who had come up to join\nhim at the wall. “Yes?”\n“Colonel Olem is here to see you.”\n“Send him up right away.” He waited until the corporal was gone to\nsag against the fortifications and breathe a sigh of relief.

That was good. Too many quality men and women had died these\nlast several weeks.\nA few moments later he heard a halting step on the stone stairs behind\nhim, and then Olem joined him at the ramparts. His face was black and\nblue, and he bore several visible wounds on his neck and hands. Olem stood\nslightly hunched, his shoulders curled inward, and Tamas could tell he was\nin a great deal of pain. He’d seen that stance many times in his long career.\nIt was the look of a man who had been flogged severely. Tamas didn’t even\nwant to know what Olem’s back looked like under the uniform.\nThere were several minutes of silence, and then Tamas heard a small\nsound like clattering coins. He looked down to see Olem’s colonel pins\nlying on the stones.\n“Did you fail your mission?” Tamas asked.\n“It didn’t go well, sir.”\n“Did you fail?”\n“The magebreaker is dead. His men are killed or captured.”\nTamas took the colonel’s pins and set them in front of Olem. “If you\ntry to give these back again, I’ll shove them up your ass.”\n“But…”\n“That was your only warning.”\nSilently, Olem returned the pins to his lapels. Tamas glanced out of the\ncorner of his eye to see Olem struggling with the pins, one of his arms in a\nsling. His face was one large bruise, and his brows and lips between them\nhad dozens of stitches. The bottom of one earlobe was gone.\n“You look like the pit,” Tamas said without reproach.\nOlem finished putting his pins back on one-handed and managed a\nwan smile. “You don’t look so well yourself, sir.”\n“I’ve had better days.” Tamas’s memories of the battle were a blur of\nblood and steel and he could not recall where he’d gotten half of his\nwounds, but he could remember the faces of hundreds of his men whom he\nwatched die. He wouldn’t sleep well for some time.\n“My report’s going to be a bit late, sir. I can’t write left-handed.”\n“Don’t worry too much.”\n“I can give it to you now if you’d like.”\n“Later. Wait. How did the Privileged girl do?”\n“Very well.” Olem hesitated. “I don’t know much about sorcery, sir,\nbut Privileged Borbador said she’s going to be the strongest Adran\nPrivileged in six hundred years.”\n“Bo has been known to exaggerate.”\n“She set fire to a magebreaker, sir. With sorcery. At least, that’s what\nBo said.”\n“That’s… remarkable.” Tamas remembered Taniel’s report of the\nmagebreaker Gothen being slain by what turned out to be one of the\nPredeii. Tamas had barely believed him at the time and might not have\nbelieved this either but he felt too tired to doubt Olem. After all, he had\nseen things in the last ten months to shake the foundations of the Nine.\nHe realized with a start that Olem was still talking, and waved him off."

I’ll get the rest later.”\n“Of course. Congratulations on the victory, sir.”\n“We’re not done yet.”\n“Sir?”\nTamas lowered his voice. “Ipille’s betrayal of the parley? It wasn’t\nhim. It was Claremonte’s men in disguise.”\n“We’ll feed him his own shoes, sir.” Olem’s eyes hardened, and his\none good hand tightened into a fist.\nTamas turned to gaze back over the Adran camp and the incoming\nDeliv procession. There was a trumpeter at the front of the Deliv column\nnow. The sound grated on his nerves. “I intend to.”\nThey watched the procession draw near, and Tamas guessed that\nSulem had just five thousand men with him, the rest of his forces camping\nup north with the captured Kez brigades. He wondered how many soldiers\nthe Deliv had lost during their battle.\n“They look like conquering heroes,” Olem said, a note of bitterness in\nhis voice.\n“They should. They met the bulk of the Kez army to the north of us.\nSurely you passed the battlefield on your way here?”\n“I saw it at a distance.”\n“They provided the distraction so we could take the city.”\n“To hazard a guess, they had a much easier fight. The Grand Army\nwasn’t hiding behind the walls with Ipille’s personal guard.”\nTamas wasn’t going to debate that. “I need them, Olem. His soldiers\nand his Privileged.”\n“Sir?”\n“We captured nearly seven thousand Kez soldiers the other day.\nThere’s just over six thousand left alive. I can’t keep the peace, not even\nwith my best men. Word has gotten around about the atrocities committed\nby the Kez in Budwiel, and vengeance is taken out upon them every night.\nI’m going to hand these prisoners over to Sulem as quickly as possible, or\nthere won’t be any left.”\n“I’ll do what I can to bring order among the men, sir.”\n“Save your strength. We leave for Adopest in the morning.”\n“You won’t stay for the treaty negotiations?”\n“I have to discover what’s happening in Adopest. Claremonte is\nplaying at some larger game and I need to find the end of it. I will make him\nanswer for the attack that disrupted our parley, but I have to do it carefully.\nHe’s holding my capital – he has the knife to our throat. I don’t know if it’ll\ntake a fight to unseat him or if he wants something else.” Tamas shook his\nhead. “I’m leaving General Arbor in charge here. The negotiations will take\nmonths at best. If Ricard Tumblar has managed to scrape together some\nmanner of civil government, I’ll have him send a delegation to join them.”\n“Very good, sir. Will the Deliv help us with Adopest?”\n“Sulem has no fight with Brudania. We’re on our own.”\n“Unfortunate.”\n“I thought so as well.”\n“Do you have orders, sir?”\n“Find one of the Deliv Privileged and get yourself healed. I need you\nby my side.

We may yet have killing to do before this is all over.”\nCHAPTER 45\nA\ndamat wound his way through the thick crowd gathered in Laughlin\nSquare on the north side of the city.\nIt was a gorgeous autumn day with barely a cloud in the sky and\nalthough the wind had picked up, Lord Claremonte’s Privileged had used\ntheir sorcery to create an umbrella of calm around the entire square for his\nbiggest public appearance since his arrival in the city. It looked to Adamat’s\neye that over five thousand people had turned out for Claremonte’s speech –\nand the promised announcement of his newest and reportedly most\ngroundbreaking endorsement.\nHe’d already been going on for almost an hour when Adamat arrived.\nFrom the rapt attention of the crowd and the frequent cheering, Adamat\nguessed it was going quite well for the head of the Brudania-Gurla Trading\nCompany.\nClaremonte himself stood upon a wooden podium erected at the south\nend of the square. Adamat had to admit that he made a dashing figure\ndressed in the finest suit and tails, gesturing for emphasis as he promised\ninheritance tax reform, more public services, and the establishment of a\nnational museum in Skyline Palace.\nAdamat gave up trying to get closer to the podium after twenty\nminutes of working his way forward and receiving dozens of elbows in his\nribs. He retreated to the next best place – a raised walk along the east side\nof the square that was mostly filled with schoolchildren and shoppers, who\nhad forgotten about the row of stores behind them and now watched\nClaremonte speak.\nIt gave Adamat a clear view of the podium and, more interestingly, of\nthe tent behind the podium. No doubt it doubled as a shaded location for\nClaremonte’s most prominent supporters, who would also give speeches\nafter the main address, and as a hiding place for Claremonte’s new\nendorsement.\nAdamat wondered if he could slip around the back and glance inside,\nbut dismissed the notion immediately. Claremonte’s security was tight –\nBrudanian soldiers were stationed at every possible approach.\nHe watched as one such soldier sternly rebuked a young boy who had\ngotten near the tent, likely with the same aim in mind as Adamat.\nThis promise of a public-figure endorsement had been the buzz of the\ncity for weeks.\nThe speech itself held little interest for Adamat. He half listened for\nthe big announcement as he let his eyes wander over the crowd, trying to\nget a sense for Claremonte’s supporters. There were the fervent believers\nnear the front, applauding at every small thing. These could have been\neither paid performers or the real thing.\nThere were the wealthy donors, who had rented balcony rooms in the\ntown houses along the north side of the square behind Claremonte. Most of\nthe crowd seemed to be working-class men and women of all walks.\nAdamat judged Claremonte to have a rather good spread of supporters,\nwith a definite leaning toward the common man, which was more the pity.\nIt meant that Ricard’s command of the union was giving him less traction\nthan one might think.\nAdamat’s eyes caught more than a few familiar faces.

    "text": "It meant that Ricard’s command of the union was giving him less traction\nthan one might think.\nAdamat’s eyes caught more than a few familiar faces. Government\nemployees. A couple of soldiers. A large number of the lesser nobility who\nhad avoided Tamas’s cull. His eyes continued to roam until they stopped on\none particularly interesting figure.\nIt was a woman with dark hair and a narrow face, dressed in black\npants and a matching jacket. She stood stoically in the crowd, ignoring her\nfellow listeners when they cheered, her hands clasped behind her back. Her\nname was Riplas, and since the eunuch’s death several months ago she had\ntaken over as the Proprietor’s second-in-command. The rumors were that it\nwas not a permanent position. Yet.\nAdamat didn’t have time to wonder at her presence. Claremonte\nshushed the crowd after a particularly long round of applause and said,\n“Ladies and gentleman, I am pleased – no, I am honored – to receive the\nendorsement of one of Adro’s leading citizens and one of the architects of\nthis new government: Ondraus, the Reeve of Adopest!”\nSome members of the audience gasped audibly. Adamat felt his mouth\nfall open, and sure enough, Ondraus the Reeve emerged from the tent\nbehind Claremonte. He wore the very best finery and sported a gold chain\nat his breast pocket. He approached the podium while Claremonte stepped\nto the side, and held his hands up for quiet.\nOndraus removed the glasses from his pocket and what looked like a\nledger from beneath his arm, setting it on the podium. He examined the\ncrowd for a few moments.\nAdamat’s mind churned. What was Ondraus up to? Ondraus was one,\nno two of the remaining members of Tamas’s council. Didn’t he know that\nTamas would wring his neck once he found out? Adamat looked through\nthe crowd until he found Riplas once again. He was one of the only men in\nthe Nine to know that Ondraus and the Proprietor were one and the same,\nbut he couldn’t come up with a connection in this situation.\nSurely there had to be one.\nOndraus cleared his throat and Privileged sorcery made his voice\nboom. “My friends and neighbors. I am here today to tell you that I endorse\nLord Claremonte for First Minister of Adro. I am not a public man, as\nsurely you may all know, but I thought this campaign important enough to\nnot just show my face but to lend my voice to Lord Claremonte.”\nAdamat was flabbergasted. For Ondraus to say he was not a public\nman was an understatement. His likeness had never once appeared in any\nnewspaper, even though he was one of the richest and most influential men\nin Adro. Adamat knew it was because of his double life as a crime lord, but\nmost people assumed he was just reclusive. If anything in Claremonte’s\ncampaign was going to get attention, it would be this.\nRicard would be furious.\n“I have done the numbers,” Ondraus said. “I have projected the\nfinancial future of Adro, and Lord Claremonte’s proposed reforms and laws"

Adamat asked himself. Had Ondraus really changed\nsides in the campaign?\nThere was a commotion in the crowd and Adamat looked for the\nsource of it but could find nothing as a round of applause erupted at\nOndraus’s words.\n“If Lord Claremonte is elected, I give you my word that —”\nOndraus was suddenly cut off as a man threw himself up on the\npodium. A couple of soldiers rushed forward as the man got to his feet, and\na gasp flew through the audience as he suddenly brandished a pistol.\nThree things happened at once: The gun went off, the bullet flying\nover Ondraus’s and Claremonte’s heads and striking the building behind the\npodium. Second, one of Claremonte’s Privileged leapt forward, his fingers\ndancing, sorcery slicing the assailant to bloody ribbons. And third, a\ngunshot went off somewhere over Adamat’s head.\nLord Claremonte went down in a spray of blood just as the screaming\nbegan. Sorcery lashed out, destroying the roof off the building behind\nAdamat and forcing him to leap from the raised walkway to get away from\nthe rain of wood and stone.\nCrouching, eyes on the sky, Adamat began to run, forcing himself\nagainst the suddenly panicked crowd. The frightened stampede began\nalmost immediately. He felt himself jostled and thrown, and he stopped to\nhelp an old woman to her feet. Then forced himself against the crowd once\nmore.\nEveryone was yelling. It was a chaotic mess. There were more\ngunshots, and Adamat heard the concussion of sorcery blasts and had no\nway of knowing if they were attacks upon the podium or reprisal from\nClaremonte’s men.\nHe managed to reach the spot where he last saw Riplas. He forced\nhimself through the throng, cursing and shouting and elbowing. Where was\nshe? Had she fled? If so, where to? Adamat had the immediate feeling that\nsomething had been engineered by the Proprietor. If Riplas had been going\nwith the flow of the crowd, she would be up ahead.\nHe plowed onward until he reached the main street, and threw himself\ninto the nearest alleyway to get out of the chaos. Catching his breath, he\nworked his way down the sidewalk until he spotted a familiar black coat.\nCrossing the street was a chore, but he made it only a moment later to find\nRiplas strolling along, letting the fleeing crowd pass her by.\nAdamat snatched her by the elbow and was startled to find himself\nsuddenly pressed up against a shop window, her forearm across his throat\nand something sharp jabbing him in the ribs.\nHer eyes searched his for a moment.\n“Riplas,” he said. “It’s me, Inspector Adamat.”\n“I know who you are, Inspector.” She slowly released him."

My lord is pretty busy these days and —”\n“Now, Riplas! This is a matter of national security! Or would he rather\nI make a house call?”\nRiplas stopped suddenly and turned. “You be careful, Inspector.”\n“I am being careful.

Riplas’s orders.”\n“Does everyone have to be blindfolded?” he asked. “How the pit do\nyou get anything done around here?”\n“Not everyone,” the man answered. “But you’re an inspector,\nInspector. Be glad we didn’t give you ether.”\n“I am, thank you. That happened last time. Now I must see your\nmaster.”\nOne of the goons nodded to the other, who went off down one of the\nhalls of the immense building. As with Adamat’s last visit, he was left with\nthe impression not of a den of iniquity, as one might expect of a crime boss,\nbut of a place of business. The marble floors gleamed, the plaster walls\nwere freshly painted, and the candlesticks had been shined. Bookkeepers\nran to and fro, while big, no-nonsense thugs lurked in the corners.\nHe was about to check his watch for the third time, when the second\ngoon reappeared and gave him a “come hither” gesture. Adamat followed\nhim down a hall to the nondescript door on their right. The man opened the\ndoor with his back to it, eyes averted, and pulled it shut after Adamat had\nstepped in.\nThe fine wood paneling was the same as it was on Adamat’s last visit,\nas were the few decorations. Only the rug had been changed – a fact that he\nnoted with interest. The desk was still covered by a screen, while the chair\nthat the Proprietor’s “translator” had occupied was empty.\nOndraus the Reeve stepped around the screen and sat in the translator’s\nchair, gesturing Adamat to take a seat across from him. “I think we can\ndispense with the usual procedure, can’t we, Inspector?”\n“I believe so.”\n“Good. Secrecy is a necessity in this game, of course, but I will admit"

Secrecy is a necessity in this game, of course, but I will admit\nthat it’s a relief to talk to someone who knows my identity. There are only\nthree of you left, with the poor eunuch dead.”\n“Riplas knows, I assume?”\n“Yes. She and my translator are the only ones.” The words were\nspoken without menace, but Adamat wasn’t slow to note that it left very\nfew people in the world who needed eliminating if Ondraus wanted to\ndestroy his second life as Adro’s criminal overlord. “Now,” Ondraus\ncontinued, “what is it you needed so urgently?”\n“I was at Claremonte’s speech today.”\n“Were you, then?” Ondraus leaned forward, steepling his fingers\nbeneath his chin. “What did you think?”\n“I thought it was an interesting career choice, what with word that\nTamas has returned.”\nOndraus rolled his eyes. “You think I’m that stupid? Is that what\nyou’re here for? You were curious about my endorsement of the late Lord\nClaremonte? You only have so much of my goodwill left to feed upon,\nAdamat. Especially after you got my eunuch killed.” There was something\nsmug about the way Ondraus said “late,” and it gave Adamat a thought.\n“ ‘Late,’ you say? He’s dead?”\n“You saw the assassination, didn’t you?”\n“Considering your endorsement of him, you don’t seem very broken\nup about it.”\n“Because I ordered his death, of course.”\nAdamat barked out a laugh. “You did? Why bother endorsing him,\nthen?”\n“Oh, my dear Inspector. That’s very naïve. I wasn’t just endorsing him.\nClaremonte named me as his Second Minister. We didn’t get to that point of\nthe speech, I’m afraid. My men may have gotten ahead of themselves. All\nthe paperwork is done, anyhow. It’s quite official.”\n“And now that he’s out of the way, you’ll be in position to take his\nplace.”\n“It’ll be in the papers tomorrow morning, I suspect.”\n“And what will Field Marshal Tamas say about this? I read that he\nshould be here in the morning.”\n“Indeed he will. And I think he’ll be far happier to hear that it is\nRicard and me running against each other rather than Ricard and\nClaremonte.”\nAdamat snorted. “I imagine he will. But you’re a private man. Why\nFirst Minister? Why now?”\n“Tastes change. You know how it is. My spot as First Minister would\nafford many benefits to the Proprietor. Or I may enjoy it enough that the\nProprietor fades into obscurity.” The Reeve shrugged. “Who knows?”\nAdamat drew a book from his jacket pocket. “I think that you may\nhave a problem there.”\n“And what is that?”\nHe held up the book. “This is The Compendium of Gods and Saints. A\nvery old book. Written during the Bleakening, the time after Kresimir first\nleft our world. Supposedly. I’m told that it’s mostly superstitious nonsense,"

    "text": "very old book. Written during the Bleakening, the time after Kresimir first\nleft our world. Supposedly. I’m told that it’s mostly superstitious nonsense,\nbut there is one thing that caught my eye.” He cleared his throat and read, “\n‘Lord Brude, saint and god of Brudania, is unique among his siblings in one\nparticular way in that he has no shadow. His shadow, it is said, is his other\nface: a unique condition of sorcery in which he occupies two separate\nbodies, making him not a single but rather two different gods.’ ” Adamat\nclosed the book.\nOndraus looked impatient. “What does that have to do with me?”\n“Lord Claremonte has no shadow.”\n“Hah! Are you claiming that he’s the god Brude?”\n“I am.”\n“I’m aware that this has been a strange time in our history and that the\nimpossible may very well be possible, but this seems to be a long leap for\nyou, Inspector.”\n“Not too much of a leap. A god told me.”\n“Oh?” Ondraus rolled his eyes.\n“The god Adom.”\nOndraus didn’t seem convinced. “He’s supposed to be dead, isn’t he?\nThe report is that Kresimir killed him.”\n“He’s still very much alive.” Adamat leaned forward. “I think it’s far\nmore difficult to kill a god than that.”\nOndraus scoffed. “If that were the case, Claremonte would still be\nalive. I’ve sent a man to the hospital to find out. I suppose we’ll discover\nthe case soon.” There was a knock on the door, then another distinct high\nknock and one low. “Come,” Ondraus said.\nAdamat recognized the Proprietor’s translator. She was a severe-\nlooking woman, her knitting tucked under one arm, her face expressionless.\nShe closed the door behind her.\n“What is the news?” Ondraus asked.\n“You have to go.”\n“Excuse me?”\nStill expressionless, the woman said, “Privileged on the street.\nBrudanian soldiers. You have less than thirty seconds.”\nOndraus leapt to his feet like a man half his age. “Get out of here, go!”\nThe woman fled, leaving Adamat alone with Ondraus. “You, Inspector.\nCome with me.” Ondraus strode to the fireplace behind his desk and turned\none of the candelabras halfway in its socket, then lifted up on the corner of\nwhat looked to be a solid mantelpiece. There was a click, and a panel beside\nthe fireplace sprang open. “Inside.”\nAdamat followed his instructions, ducking inside a low but well-used\npassageway. They were suddenly plunged into darkness as Ondraus closed\nthe hidden panel behind them. “Faster!” Ondraus ordered. “The Privileged\nwill be able to see us moving. We tarry too long here and they’ll suspect\nwho we are. Watch your step.”\nAdamat stumbled, nearly falling down a flight of stairs despite\nOndraus’s warning. He followed those down almost thirty steps, the air\nbecoming cold, close, and damp. They rushed along, splashing through\npuddles, and Adamat heard the unmistakable sound of a scream somewhere"

There was a great wrenching noise and a crash, followed by\nmore screams and the sound of gunshots.\n“Quickly!” Ondraus poked Adamat hard in the back, forcing him on\nahead, half-crouched, for well over a hundred yards. The passage was\nstoned in with an inch of water on the bottom, and Adamat could not tell in\nthe darkness where it would end.\n“Up,” Ondraus ordered suddenly.\nAdamat’s foot hit a step a moment later, and his legs carried him up\nanother flight until he could discern a source of light.\n“Head,” Ondraus said.\n“What – ow!” Adamat’s head hit a plank, and he reached up to push a\ntrapdoor out of his way. They emerged into some kind of a basement that\nsmelled of hay and the rich, grassy smell of horse manure. They went up\nanother flight of wooden steps and emerged into a stable.\n“Into my carriage,” Ondraus said quickly. “Driver!” he shouted.\nA moment later and Ondraus’s carriage shot into the light, carried\ndown the streets of Adopest and into the normal daily traffic.\nAdamat leaned against the wall of the carriage, breathing a sigh of\nrelief, his heart thundering in his ears.\n“Turn here!” Ondraus shouted.\nThe carriage turned and they drove past a street that ended in a small\nbut well-appointed courtyard and a three-story brick building. The\ncourtyard was full of soldiers and the façade of the building had been ripped\napart by sorcery, fire flaring into the air from the roof. Bodies were being\ndragged out of the building – some Brudanian soldiers, but mostly the\nProprietor’s goons.\n“You keep a carriage on hand at all times?” Adamat asked as they\ndrove on past the Proprietor’s headquarters and into the anonymity of the\nmidday streets.\n“Three, actually,” Ondraus said. His eyes were glued to the window\nand he was grinding his teeth. “Decades of work down the shit hole. Must\nhave caught one of my lieutenants.”\n“We’re in the banking district,” Adamat said with surprise, recognizing\nthe main thoroughfare they’d just pulled onto.\n“Of course we are. I – and I mean Ondraus the Reeve – works here. I\ncouldn’t have it on the other bloody side of town.” Ondraus pounded twice\non the roof and the carriage pulled off to the side of the road. The driver got\ndown and opened the door. “The council is meeting with Field Marshal\nTamas tomorrow at four. Be there. Be ready to explain to Tamas your\ntheory about Claremonte. And try to be more convincing than you were to\nme.”\nAdamat stepped out and the door slammed shut behind him. He turned,\nmouth open, but the carriage was already rolling away.\nHe waited for a few moments before hailing a hackney cab. He had the\ndistinct feeling that Tamas would more readily believe the news than\nOndraus.\nCHAPTER 46\nT\namas’s soldiers deployed their camp two miles outside the walls of\nAdopest."

The black tooth of Sablethorn\nPrison rose above the city and seemed to lean even more since the\nearthquake last spring. He made a mental note to mention it to the council.\nThe building might have to be taken down before it could fall.\n“Sometimes when we’re out on campaign,” Tamas said, “far away\nfrom the lands we love, it’s easy to forget why we go on fighting.” He\ngestured to the city sitting serenely at the tip of the teardrop of the Adsea.\n“Coming home always reminds me why I fight.”\n“It’s a beautiful sight, sir,” Olem said. Olem seemed to have recovered\nwell enough, thanks to the Deliv Privileged, but Tamas knew it would be\nsome time before he had the spring back in his step. “You have any more\norders for the boys?”\n“Spread the camp wide. I don’t want a surprise attack by their\nPrivileged to be able to wipe out more than a single brigade.”\nOlem lifted his spyglass to one eye. “They don’t seem like they’re\nlooking for a fight. Crowd’s gathering on the walls, though. Only see a few\nBrudanian soldiers.”\n“That doesn’t mean anything. Spread the camp and post my remaining\npowder mages on guard duty. Any Privileged comes within a mile of the\ncamp and they are not under a white flag, they’re to put a bullet through\ntheir eyes. And get me a guard. We’re going in.”\n“Yes sir.”\nThirty minutes later Tamas was riding out of his camp and toward the\nsouthwestern gate of Adopest. His guard consisted of sixty men: Olem’s\nbest Riflejacks as well as Nila, Bo, and Gavril. He loathed going anywhere\nwithout his powder mages at his back, but they were better suited to\nkeeping watch over the army.\n“You sent messengers?” he asked Olem as they approached the open\ngates. People watched him from the crowded walls and children waved\nflags. He could hear their cheering from a mile away.\n“Yes sir. They’ll be ready for us.”\n“Good.”\nThey rode beneath the arches and Tamas found the people lining the\nstreets, calling his name. His messengers had been for his council alone, so\nthis crowd would have had to gather since this morning. Not a bad\nwelcome, he decided.\nThey rode through the Factory District and across the Ad, from whose\nbridge he could clearly see the ruins of Kresim Cathedral – cleared away\nbut for the immense cornerstones and the footprint of the outer wall. City\nfolk turned out to wave him past as word spread of his arrival, but Tamas\npaid them little mind. His eyes were on the rooftops and the alleyways,\nwatching for Brudanian Privileged or soldiers.\nNone showed themselves but the few stationed upon the old walls,\nwho simply watched him pass.\n“Olem, I —”\n“Sir,” Olem interrupted, tapping him on the shoulder.

He pointed into\none of the alleyways along the street and then tugged on his reins, dropping\nback behind Tamas with a hand on his pistol.\nA horse emerged from the alley and fell into step beside Tamas. Tamas\neyed the rider in his dark Adran blues. “Good to see you, son.”\nTaniel nodded in response. He looked haggard and tired. His uniform\nwas dirty and rumpled, but he’d managed to brush out most of the dirt and\nhis boots were polished. Tamas noted a distinct absence of Taniel’s usual\nHrusch rifle, but he did have two pistols in his belt.\n“Where have you been?” Tamas asked.\n“Hiding. Gavril make it to you?”\n“Yes. He’s at the back of the column.”\nTaniel gave a relieved sigh. “Vlora’s dead.”\n“What?” Tamas had to grab his saddle horn as a wave of dizziness\nswept over him. “No. Surely not.”\n“She is. At least, I think she is. We tracked the Privileged and Ka-poel\nto the city and got into a fight in High Talien. Whether the Privileged had\nreinforcements waiting for her or we were just unlucky, I don’t know. We\nwere trying to escape into the city drains when the building came down on\nher.”\n“Oh, pit.” The words came out a whisper. Tamas swayed in his saddle.\nAnother powder mage. Another friend. Pit, Vlora was family. He wanted to\nlet out a sob, but he forced himself to fight it down, maintaining his stony\ndemeanor. Claremonte’s men were watching. He could feel hostile eyes\nupon him and he couldn’t – he wouldn’t – show weakness.\n“Promoting me was a bad idea.”\nTamas glanced out of the corner of his eye. Taniel’s jaw trembled and\nhis eyes were bloodshot. He was barely holding it together. “That’s not true.\nThat’s… Look. You tracked them this far. I’m proud of you.”\nTaniel didn’t look like he believed him, and Tamas had to admit that\nthe words were halfhearted. Taniel had gotten Vlora, two powder mages,\nand a dozen Riflejacks killed. He should have known better! Walking into a\ntrap and…\nNo. No, no, no. Tamas could feel the grief turn to anger, could feel the\ncorners of his mouth turn down in a scowl. He couldn’t do that. Not now.\nNot to Taniel.\n“Have you found Ka-poel?” Tamas asked.\n“Claremonte’s headquarters are in Skyline Palace. He’s renting it from\nthe city. It’s crawling with soldiers and Privileged. I think I glimpsed her\naura in the Else, but it was hard to tell at a distance. She must still be alive.”\n“Or else Kresimir would have killed us all by now, I suppose.”\nTaniel gave him a queer look. “Is the war over?”\n“Yes. It’s in negotiations right now.”\n“Do you have Kresimir’s body?”\n“I do.”\nTaniel nodded to himself. “Good. What about Claremonte?”"

Are you coming to my council\nmeeting?”\n“Will Ricard be there?”\n“I imagine so.”\n“I probably shouldn’t, then.”\n“You can’t run from being Second Minister,” Tamas said. “You gave\nyour word.”\n“I was bullied into it.”\nTamas set his teeth, trying to rein in his anger. “You took advantage of\nwhat avenue of escape was available at the time. You’ll follow through on\nyour word.”\n“Or what?” There was defiance in Taniel’s eyes.\n“Or no one will ever respect you.”\nTaniel looked away.\n“It’s part of the game,” Tamas said, trying to soften his tone. “Part of\nlife. You think I wanted to be the Iron King’s lapdog when I was not much\nolder than you? No. But I did what I had to do to survive. We’re here. Come\nupstairs.”\nThey had arrived at the western entrance to the People’s Court,\nSablethorn looming over them from across Elections Square. Tamas\ndismounted, and his soldiers took their places by the doors, Gavril in\ncommand, while a core group of them followed him inside.\nIt had been only a few months since he last set foot in the cavernous\nbuilding, but it felt like half a lifetime. He didn’t recognize most of the staff\nthey passed in the halls, and the corridors felt vaguely alien, as if he were\nwalking them for the first time.\nThey climbed to the sixth floor and approached Manhouch’s former\noffice, and Tamas could hear shouting from a hundred paces down the hall.\nHe doubled his pace.\nHe pushed open the door to find Ondraus sitting in one of the\nwingback chairs in the corner, looking crossly over his reading glasses at\nRicard Tumblar. Ricard was red in the face, his beard unkempt as he shook\nhis fist beneath Ondraus’s nose. Lady Winceslav stood behind Ricard with a\nfan in one hand, trying to look dignified.\n“You damned dirty traitor!” Ricard was shouting. “You prig! You\nvillain! I’ll kill you with my own hands!” Lady Winceslav leapt forward to\ngrab Ricard’s arm, pulling him away from Ondraus.\n“What’s going on here?” Tamas demanded.\nLady Winceslav opened her mouth, but Ricard cut her off, thrusting a\nfinger at Ondraus. “He’s gone over to the other side! He’s put his support\nbehind Claremonte. He’s running as Claremonte’s Second Minister!”\n“I’m sure there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this,” Lady\nWinceslav said.\nRicard rounded on her. “Don’t get me started on you, Lady. Your\npeople abandoned the army before the war was over. Do you know how that\nlooks to public perception? We’re supposed to be a unified face!”\n“I had every right.” Winceslav drew herself up. “My advisers felt that\nField Marshal Tamas had lost his perspective, and his series of blunders had\ngiven us – I’m sorry, Tamas, I don’t mean this to be personal.”"

He gave all three of them a cold smile. “No, no. Go on,\nplease.”\n“We felt that our losses —”\n“You got scared and you pulled out of the fight!” Ricard said\naccusingly. “I thought we were all in this together and now I learn that this\ncrazy old coot is one of Claremonte’s stooges!”\nOndraus sat up straighter. “Now, listen here —”\n“No, you listen!” Lady Winceslav’s voice rose to a shout. “We all have\nour own reasons for what we’ve done! I don’t think —”\nThe room devolved into a jumble of heated shouting and finger\npointing. Tamas rested his chin on his palm, listening for a few moments\nbefore he pointed at Olem and snapped his fingers. Olem removed his pistol\nand carefully loaded it without a bullet. He crossed from the door and\nhanded the pistol to Tamas.\nThe blast of the shot brought everything to silence. Three sets of eyes\nstared at him, the members of his council frozen in their places.\nTamas breathed deeply of the powder smoke from the end of his pistol\nand set it on the desk. “Can you win the election?”\nRicard tugged furiously at his beard and began to pace, eyeing the\nReeve suspiciously.\n“Just answer the question,” Tamas said.\n“I have the best people in all the Nine running my campaign. They tell\nme it’s a close thing. I’ve been matching Claremonte penny for penny as he\nbribes, threatens, and cajoles his way toward Election Day, and I’m almost\nout of money. He’s not.”\n“That’s not the reassurance I was looking for,” Tamas muttered. More\nloudly he said, “What do you need to win?”\nRicard glanced at Taniel, who stood near the balcony windows,\nlooking out over Elections Square. “The election is on the last day of\nautumn, which is just a few days away. Appearances from my running mate\nwould help things. An endorsement from you would be enormously\nbeneficial.”\n“You’ll have it in the newspaper tomorrow morning,” Tamas said. For\nall the things he didn’t like about Ricard, the man was a gifted businessman.\nIf he could run a country halfway as well as he ran the union, Adro would\nbe the jewel of the Nine for decades to come. “I suppose just killing\nClaremonte would be out of the question?” he asked mildly.\nRicard stiffened. “Absolutely. We have worked far too hard for this\nelection. We made the rules and we must play by them, else we’ve\naccomplished nothing.”\n“I agree,” Lady Winceslav said.\n“Well, at least there’s that.” Tamas gazed at his still-smoking pistol.\nThe world was changing, and in a few days’ time he wouldn’t have the\npower he once had to silence his enemies. He had to relinquish that power\nwillingly.\n“Besides, the Proprietor already tried that,” Ondraus added. “It didn’t\nwork.”"

Blast him!”\n“Where is the eunuch, anyway?” Tamas asked. “And Prime Lektor?”\n“The eunuch is dead,” Ondraus said shortly. “The Proprietor has not\nyet appointed a replacement to this council.”\n“Nor will he. It’s too late in the game for a replacement. After the\nelection this council will be dissolved anyway. As,” Tamas said loudly,\nraising his hand to forestall protest, “we all agreed when this began. How\nabout Prime?”\n“Prime has fled,” a voice said.\nTamas turned to find Adamat in the doorway, his face flushed and\nbreath short from a run up the stairs.\n“I’m sorry I’m late,” he said, closing the door behind him.\n“Were you invited?” Tamas asked.\n“I invited him,” Ricard said.\nTamas wiped his brow with a handkerchief. “Thank Adom you did.\nThis council needs a voice of reason.”\n“I’m afraid I have very little of that to offer,” Adamat said.\n“Olem, see to the door. Go on, Inspector.”\n“Wait!” Ricard said, pointing at Ondraus. “He’s not one of us anymore.\nHe shouldn’t be here to hear any of it.”\nAdamat leaned heavily on his cane and swept his gaze across the\nroom. “He already knows.”\n“Oh.”\nTamas nodded. “Inspector.”\n“Prime Lektor has fled the country. Perhaps even the Nine. His\nassistant claims that Prime muttered about something worse coming before\nhe went, then stole away in the middle of the night.”\nTamas cocked his head to one side. “What the pit could he have\nmeant? The man stood at our side when Kresimir was knocking at our door.\nWhat could frighten him more than that?”\n“I thought he was supposed to be some kind of ancient Privileged,”\nLady Winceslav said. “Was that a hoax? Was he just an addled professor\nafter all?”\n“No hoax, I believe, my lady,” Adamat said. “I suspect that Prime fled\nbecause he discovered what is really going on.”\n“And what is really going on, pray tell?” Ricard asked.\n“Lord Claremonte is the two-faced god of Brudania. Brude himself.”\nThe room was silent for several moments, and Tamas put his chin in\nhis hand, considering the implications.\n“Surely you can’t be serious,” Lady Winceslav said.\nTamas said, “We’ve already met two gods. Why not more in this mad\nfray? Claremonte has been behind the scenes for some time, manipulating\nevents. It would make sense.” Even as he said the words, he didn’t want to\nbelieve it. Another god, here in Adopest, playing with mortals like they\nwere pieces on a game board? The very thought made his blood boil. “What\nevidence do you have?”\n“I’d rather discuss that with you alone, Field Marshal,” Adamat said."

What\ncould —” There was a knock on the door and Ricard stopped midsentence.\n“What is it?” he yelled.\nOlem stuck his head in the room and addressed Tamas. “Sir,” he said.\n“Someone to see you.”\n“Who is it?” Tamas snapped.\n“It’s Lord Claremonte, sir.”\nAdamat had the very sudden and very powerful urge to hide beneath the\nsofa. He looked toward Tamas, who, to his credit, remained stone-faced.\n“What does he want?” Tamas asked.\n“A moment to speak to the council.”\nTamas lifted a finger to his bodyguard, who crossed the room and\nleaned down. Tamas whispered something in his ear and the man gave one\nnod, touching the butt of his pistol, before he returned to the hallway.\n“This is a bad idea,” Adamat said, almost without thinking. He glanced\nat Ondraus, who had nearly lost his life to Claremonte’s men just yesterday.\nThe old man was stiff, his fingers clutching the armrests of his chair, eyes\non the door as a rabbit might watch a circling falcon. Adamat remembered\nOndraus’s suspicion that one of his lieutenants had been captured and\nwondered if perhaps Ondraus’s other identity had been compromised.\nClaremonte would, rightfully, want his head.\nTamas didn’t answer Adamat, but rather said, “We shall receive our\nguest with patience and courtesy. Is that understood, Taniel?”\nAdamat glanced at the field marshal’s son, having almost forgotten his\npresence. He was shocked by what he saw. Captain Two-shot’s hands were\nballed into fists and he leaned forward on his toes like a dog straining at a\nleash. There was a hunger in his eyes, and fury. Adamat looked to the field\nmarshal for reassurance that he would keep his son restrained, only to find a\nglint of that same hunger and fury in Tamas’s eyes. It was well hidden, and\nthe rest of the council seemed oblivious to it, but to Adamat it was plain as\nday.\nHe glanced at the sofa, wondering if he could fit beneath it, then eyed\nthe walls for a closet door. Somewhere – anywhere – he could hide.\nIt was too late. The door opened and Tamas’s bodyguard stepped\ninside. “Lord Claremonte,” he announced.

    "text": "“We are,” Ondraus croaked.\nStop looking so guilty, Adamat thought, looking furiously at Ondraus.\nTo his relief, the old Reeve shifted to get comfortable in his seat and\nrepeated the words somewhat more confidently.\n“Excellent! Lady Winceslav, it’s an honor! Now that this dreadful war\nis over, we must discuss deploying your troops to Gurla. The Trading\nCompany could use your soldiers badly. And Ricard, my esteemed\nopponent!” Claremonte dipped at the waist, managing a bow that was both\ngraceful and seemingly unironic.\nClaremonte’s eyes swept over Taniel Two-shot. Adamat thought he\nsensed the slightest hesitation there. Then Claremonte stepped over to the\ndesk and offered his hand to Tamas. “Field Marshal. I am your greatest\nadmirer. I am so pleased to see you return from the disastrous expedition to\nKez and end this war once and for all. It’s a relief to us all.”\n“My Lord Brude,” Tamas said, taking Claremonte’s hand for a\nmoment.\nClaremonte’s smile widened slightly, and Adamat would be damned if\nhis eyes hadn’t twinkled. “Don’t tell me,” he said. “Adamat discovered it. I\ntold Lord Vetas that the good inspector was twice as clever as he gave him\ncredit.” He turned to Adamat and swept an imaginary hat from his head.\n“You did well, Inspector. What gave it away? No! Wait. Don’t tell me. It’s\nfar more mysterious to let it go unsaid.”\nAdamat felt his teeth clench. He didn’t trust himself to speak. All the\nfear and trepidation was gone, replaced by anger. All Claremonte had to do\nwas mention Vetas’s name to remind Adamat of all the horror that man had\ninflicted on Adamat’s family.\nRelax, he told himself. This was Claremonte’s goal. To put them all on\nedge. And it was working. Lady Winceslav was uneasy, Taniel Two-shot\nlooked ready to murder, Ondraus was queasy, and Ricard didn’t seem to\nknow whether to run or fight.\nOnly Tamas seemed unperturbed, and only just. If Claremonte’s eyes\ntwinkled from amusement, Tamas’s twinkled as if he was imagining a very\nslow, painful way for Claremonte to die.\n“Now.” Claremonte clapped his hands loudly, making Ricard jump\nhalfway out of his shoes. “On to business.” He strode across the room and\ndeposited himself in a wingback chair opposite Tamas’s desk and eyed\nTaniel for a moment. “I’m the last god left in the Nine. Kresimir is\nrestrained and Adom is dead. None of the rest of my brothers and sisters\nwill join this fray, I can promise you that.\n“I imagine you all think I’m about to make some inane threats, but you\ndo me injustice with the thought. Unlike my elder sibling, I am a modern\ngod. I understand that these things can’t be forced. I could kill you all and\nenslave the Nine, but that would hardly be sporting.

Within years there\nwould be rebellion and powerful Privileged rising up to challenge me, and\nfrankly I don’t have the constitution for that kind of thing. I don’t like\nconfrontation. If Adom were here, he would tell you that’s true.”\n“Convenient that he is not,” Tamas said.\n“Sadly, you should say,” Claremonte reprimanded sternly. “I was\nalways rather fond of Adom. He was the only one who ever took me\nseriously. And his food was to die for.” He drew the word “die” out for\nseveral moments and dramatically threw his head to one side.\n“Your point?” Tamas asked. “Some of us don’t have aeons to live, you\nknow.”\nClaremonte grinned fiercely. “Pit, you have spirit. That’s what I love\nabout you. Back in Kresimir’s time, there was this general named – damn, I\ndon’t remember now. Anyway, he was a mortal, not even a Knacked, and he\nwas the only one who would stand up to Kresimir when he thought he was\ndoing something stupid. Novi used to say he had balls as big as South Pike.\nYou remind me of him.” Claremonte’s face grew pensive. “Kresimir had\nhim flayed alive, in the end. Stupid waste. Anyway, where was I?”\n“Your point,” Tamas said.\n“Ah, my point! I am a modern god, as I was saying, and I play fairly.\nYou have my word that this war is over. What’s more, I’m only here for the\nelection. Tomorrow morning I will withdraw my troops from Adopest as a\ngesture of goodwill. In three days the election will go forward as planned.\nI’m not even going to rig it. If I’m elected as First Minister of Adro, I will\nhelp usher this country into an era of prosperity the likes of which the Nine\nhas never seen.”\n“And if you lose?” Adamat found his voice, and decided to try it out.\nThe words only trembled a little.\n“If I lose, my good Inspector, I will go back to Brudania and my\nTrading Company and continue trying to better mankind from my position\nof power there. I will molest you no further.”\n“Why should we trust you?” Adamat demanded.\nClaremonte turned to look at him, eyebrows raised innocently.\n“Because you have no other choice. And because I just gave you my word.\nThe word of a god is a solemn oath.”\n“You arranged all of this.” Adamat felt his anger coming forward,\nstraining as a powerful pressure in his chest. “Kresimir’s return. The Kez-\nAdran War. You’ve had your fingers in it from the beginning. I’ve seen\nVetas’s notes. Don’t try to deny it.”\n“Why would I deny it? Of course I’ve been involved with it. But\nyou’re being unfair. It was Julene, that misguided child, and the Kez cabal\nwho conspired to bring Kresimir back. You think I wanted my elder brother\nhere, poking his nose into everything? He’d send us all back to the Bronze\nAge! No, I simply put my fingers into the pot to try to mitigate his damage."

No, I simply put my fingers into the pot to try to mitigate his damage.\nThe people I’ve used along the way, including your family, I’m afraid, are\nunfortunate casualties of a war you didn’t even know you were fighting.”\n“Don’t you reduce my family to ‘unfortunate casualties,’ ” Adamat\ngrowled through his teeth. He gripped his cane so hard in his hand he\nthought he might snap the handle. If Claremonte cared for his fury he gave\nno indication.\n“You attacked my forces,” Tamas said, his fingers still steepled\nbeneath his chin. “You tricked me into betraying a white flag of truce, and\nyou took something that doesn’t belong to you.”\n“Ah. That was… unfortunate,” Claremonte said. “I did what I thought\nnecessary. My spies told me about the savage girl and her restraining of\nKresimir – remarkable, by the way – and I didn’t know what to think. If she\nfaltered even once, all of this would be for naught. I thought it necessary to\ntake action and capture her. I assure you, the order was given without the\nknowledge that you had called a truce with Ipille.”\n“You keep using the word ‘unfortunate,’ ” Taniel suddenly said,\nturning all the heads in the room. “It stinks of apologetic ingratiation.”\n“I’m a businessman, my boy. Apologetic ingratiation is what I do. Ask\nRicard.”\n“Why are you here?” Adamat said. “The next week could have gone\nby without you revealing any of this and it would have proceeded just the\nsame.”\n“I wanted to make sure that this council knew what and who I am. We\ndon’t need any more of that same hullabaloo that occurred with the\nProprietor’s men. That would be ill advised. As would you attacking me\nwith your bare hands, Mr. Two-shot.” Claremonte’s eyes flicked to Taniel,\nwho looked ready to leap.\n“It worked on Kresimir,” Taniel said breathlessly. “How do you think I\ngot his blood for Ka-poel?”\nClaremonte blanched at that. “I’d rather not find out. Now, I suggest a\ntrade. The girl in exchange for Kresimir’s body.”\n“Done,” Taniel said.\nTamas stood, shooting Taniel a glance. “What makes you think we\nhave it?”\nClaremonte gave him a level look. “Come now.”\n“Ka-poel will be returned unhurt,” Taniel said.\n“Taniel, enough,” Tamas barked.\n“Not that girl,” Claremonte said. “I need that girl. I’ll give you another\ngirl.”\n“Who?” Tamas’s brow furrowed.\n“Vlora.”\n“She’s still alive?” Taniel asked.\n“Quiet!” Tamas roared. “Taniel, wait outside. That’s an order!”\nFor a few moments Adamat thought that Taniel would resist his father,\nbut with a glare for Claremonte he stalked out into the hallway.\n“That’s not a fair trade,” Tamas said when his son was gone.\n“Your powder mages killed many of my Privileged.

The fact that Vlora\nis still alive is more than testament to my generosity.”\n“And the fact that I didn’t let Taniel pummel you into next week is\ntestament to mine.”\nClaremonte rolled his eyes. “We needn’t resort to threats, Field\nMarshal. We aren’t children.”\nTamas drummed his fingers on his desk, eyeing Claremonte. “The\ntrade would be conditional on the return of both Vlora and Ka-poel, and the\nwithdrawal of every last one of your men from Adopest.”\n“You can’t be considering this,” Winceslav protested. “We don’t know\nwhat use he’ll make of Kresimir’s body.”\n“If I wished to release him, I would only have had to kill the girl,”\nClaremonte said. “Bring Mr. Two-shot back inside. He’ll tell you.” He\nshook his head. “I’ve already promised to remove my men, but I can’t give\nyou the savage. She’s the only thing holding Kresimir in check and I want\nmy eye on her. Once Kresimir is buried in the deepest ocean trench, where\nthe weight of the sea above him would keep even him from rising, I will\ngive back the savage. You have my word.”\nThe room was quiet for several minutes while Tamas considered this,\nand Adamat wondered why Ondraus and Ricard hadn’t protested. This was\nmadness! If Tamas had Kresimir’s body, it was not something he should let\nout of his keeping.\n“Lady Winceslav is right,” Adamat said quietly.\nTamas glanced at him and sighed. “I agree. I can’t make that trade,\nClaremonte.”\n“Hmm.” Claremonte got to his feet and collected his hat and cane from\nthe sofa. “That is most unfortunate. Still, I will stand by my word. My men\nleave the city tomorrow, and then we wait for the results of the election.\nUntil then, good luck.” He bowed to them each in turn and then left.\nThe rest of the meeting was a somber affair. Adamat heard shouting a\nfew minutes after Claremonte left, presumably when Taniel found out his\nfather wouldn’t make the trade. An hour went by before Ondraus followed\nClaremonte, presumably for their meeting at lunch, and an hour after that\nAdamat was alone with the field marshal.\n“The books say that Brude has two faces,” Adamat said. “Not just\nsome kind of allegory, but two actual presences.”\n“So Claremonte isn’t the only enemy we have to focus on?”\n“No. He’s not. I’m looking for the other one.”\n“It could be anyone?”\n“Yes.”\nTamas let his head drop into his hands. “That just made my day\ninfinitely worse, Inspector.”\n“Sorry, sir. Do you trust Claremonte?”\n“Not at all. I’ll believe he’s going to leave of his own volition ten years\nafter he actually does it.” Tamas held his head in his hands, staring at his\ndesk. “Please tell me you have any information to make this better.”\n“As a matter of fact, I do.”"

See, when Claremonte said he was the last god left in the Nine,\nhe wasn’t precisely correct. Adom is still alive.”\nCHAPTER 47\nT\namas gazed up at the doors to the manor, then down at the two uniformed\nguards who had stopped snoozing on the front step and now stood at\nattention before him. They were city policemen, who seemed to know who\nhe was.\n“As you were,” he said. “I’m not officially here.”\nThe two guards exchanged glances and seemed to relax.\n“Just having a look around.” Tamas dismounted and handed his reins\nto one of the guards, while Olem handed his to the other. “Probably best not\nto mention my presence to anyone.”\n“Yes sir,” one of the guards said.\nTamas slipped in through the front door and stood in the foyer, soaking\nin the eerie silence. Olem came in behind him, holding up a lantern, which\nthrew shadows across the marble floors.\n“You seem pensive, sir,” Olem said.\n“The last time I was here, I almost died. That kind of thing makes a\nman pensive. In fact, shouldn’t you be just as pensive?”\n“I just think this place is in bad taste.”\n“It belonged to Charlemund,” Tamas said. “He was more concerned\nwith opulence than with good taste. At least his damned bust isn’t here\nstaring me in the face anymore.”\n“You broke it, sir.”\n“Ah. That’s right. Come on.”\nThey left the foyer and took a right, heading down one of the great\nhallways toward the kitchen per Adamat’s instructions. As they drew closer,\nTamas could hear a distinct humming and felt his step quicken\ninvoluntarily. They reached the end of the hall and he gestured for Olem to\nwait for him, then stepped inside.\nUnlike the rest of the empty manor, the kitchen was full of warmth and\nlight. Two of the ovens burned brightly, and Tamas was hit by the smell of\nwarm bread, roasting mutton, and squash soup. His mouth watered and his\nfingers twitched in anticipation.\nThe main baking table was clean at one end and set with silver\ntableware for two.\n“Good morning, Field Marshal.”\nIt was a shock to see Charlemund in a chef’s apron, white hat on his\nhead, and for a moment Tamas reached for his sword. Charlemund had put\non at least two stone since Tamas had shot the Arch-Diocel in the gut and\nthen thrown him under guard until he could figure out what to do with him.\nHis face was broader, and he wore a grin that Tamas had never seen on\nCharlemund before.\nHe let his hand fall away from his sword. “It’s really you? Mihali?”\n“Mihali is dead.” The grin faltered for a moment. “Unfortunate to say.\nI am Adom, in my purest form.” He looked down at himself. “Well, I never"

    "text": "“Mihali is dead.” The grin faltered for a moment. “Unfortunate to say.\nI am Adom, in my purest form.” He looked down at himself. “Well, I never\nlooked quite like this. I’ll admit that Charlemund was a little handsomer\nthan me, in my original body.”\n“How?” Tamas asked.\nAdom tugged at the strings of his apron and swept it to one side.\n“Come! Break bread with me. I can hear your stomach from here and I\nhaven’t eaten in at least a couple of hours.”\nThere were no chairs, and the table was too high for them anyway, so\nTamas stood opposite Adom while the god ladled him a bowl of squash\nsoup. A few minutes later, Tamas was asking for another, which Adom\nhappily supplied, before serving the main meal of mutton, sliced thin on\ntoasted bread.\n“Your son,” Adom finally said, breaking the silence.\nTamas stopped chewing for a moment, having forgotten he’d even\nasked a question. “What about him?”\n“After he shot Kresimir, the counterstroke almost killed him. It would\nhave killed anyone else instantly, but Ka-poel’s wards were tight enough to\nblock even Kresimir’s fury. It put him right on the brink, and even I\ncouldn’t bring him back. But that darling girl.” Adom shook his head. “I’ve\nnever seen anyone learn so quickly. Not even Kresimir himself.”\n“What does that have to do with you?”\n“I’m getting there. She figured out that Taniel’s coma would require a\nlife. So she took Charlemund’s. She stripped his essence from him, leaving\nhis body nothing more than a husk.”\n“That’s terrifying.”\n“Yes. Yes it is, and I have lived hundreds of lives over thousands of\nyears. I know terrifying.”\n“But how do you know all this?”\n“She told me. While you were in Kez.”\n“She can’t speak.”\n“She’s a very good communicator. Anyway, I stole the body, and when\nKresimir killed Mihali, I transferred myself into it.” He slapped his belly\nhappily. “It was a crude transfer. I usually put myself into a brand-new\nvessel, an infant still growing inside a mother’s womb, one that might\notherwise be stillborn. But this method worked just as well!”\nTamas looked down at his meal to find it almost gone. He reached for\nthe platter between them, but Adom was faster, slicing off several pieces of\nmutton and depositing them on Tamas’s plate.\n“Why didn’t you come back?” Tamas asked.\nAdom chuckled. “Well, I’m in the body of the most hated public figure\nin Adro, so that would have been inconvenient.”\n“Brude,” Tamas said.\nAdom sobered. “Brude,” he confirmed.\n“Did you know he was involved?”\n“I didn’t. Not until after Kresimir killed me. There is an instant,\nflashing between consciousnesses, that I am more aware than when inside a\nbody. That’s when I felt his influence. It explains a lot, really. Him trying to\nkeep Mihali under wraps at the asylum, for one thing. He wanted to keep an\neye on me. Keep me out of the way.” Adom scowled."

He claims —”\n“I know what he claims,” Adom said, waving his hand. “I’ve seen that\nmuch. But whether he’s telling the truth, I can’t tell you.”\n“You’re not a lot of help.”\nAdom let out a booming laugh at that, and Tamas found himself\ngrinning. That laugh was all Mihali.\n“Brude. Brude, Brude, Brude.” Adom shook his head, wiping tears of\nmirth from his eyes. “He’s the youngest of us, you know. A prankster. He\nhad the ambition to match Kresimir, but he lived in Kresimir’s shadow. He\nbickered with everyone. Even the two of us had our quarrels, though none\nas serious as he had with the others.” Adom popped a bit of bread into his\nmouth. “I can’t pierce the veil he’s raised around himself, but I can tell you\nthat he’s now far more powerful than he ever was in Kresimir’s time. That\nscares me.”\n“Confront him with us,” Tamas said. “We can force his hand. Find out\nwhat he wants.”\n“Oooooh no. Forcing his hand would be a grave mistake. I’m no match\nfor Brude.”\nTamas leaned back, his food turning sour in his mouth. “Then what do\nwe do?”\n“You find out if he’s going to keep his word or not. Brude was always\nthe most forward-thinking of all of us. He might actually be telling the\ntruth. But I’ll warn you: There are always two sides to everything he says\nand does, just as there are two sides to Brude himself.”\n“And if he doesn’t keep his word?”\nAdom lifted a chestnut from his plate and popped it in his mouth. He\nlooked up to meet Tamas’s eyes. “If he doesn’t keep his word, there’s not a\nlot we can do about it.”\n“You’re just going to hide here, aren’t you?”\n“That was my plan. I’d rather he not know that I’m still alive, to be\nhonest.”\nTamas threw his fork away in disgust. “What happened to standing\nbeside us? What happened to being the patron saint of Adro?”\nAdom picked up Tamas’s fork and cleaned it with the corner of his\napron. He set it carefully back on Tamas’s plate. “Something scares me\nabout Brude, Tamas. Something that was never there when we were young.\nI can’t put my finger on it. An instinct deeper than my age or my sorcery is\ntelling me to stay away.”\n“I’ve fought too long and too hard for this country to step aside and let\nsomeone have at it. Even a god.” Tamas wiped his face with a napkin and\nstepped away from the table. “I don’t know why I came here.”\n“For advice.”\n“It was a wasted trip.”\nAdom gave him a sad smile. “I’m glad you came. I worried for you.”\n“Not enough to help, it seems.”\n“You have so little faith that things will work out, Tamas. Here.” He"

I may be a fat coward, but\ndo you take me for rude?”\n“Am I doing the right thing, Olem?”\nThe moon was full and bright above them, even though daylight was\nonly an hour or two away, and Tamas barely noticed the smell of Olem’s\ncigarette. They stood in a grove between two farms a few miles outside of\nAdopest, their presence sheltered from the casual eye by the screen of old-\ngrowth trees. It was chilly, and Tamas tightened his jacket at the collar.\n“Not for me to judge, sir.”\n“You’re as useless as Adom.”\n“Now, that’s unfair, sir. He did give us something to eat. Pit, I miss his\ncooking.”\nTamas shook his head. “I was so mad he wouldn’t help that I forgot to\nask his advice on this.”\n“You think it would have changed your mind?”\nTamas hesitated. “No.”\n“I thought not.”\n“Shut up and smoke your damn cigarette. And stop looking so smug.\nWhere’s Bo?”\n“Over there.”\nTamas made his way to the edge of the grove, where Borbador and his\napprentice stood just inside the trees, watching the road that led to Adopest.\n“They’re late,” Tamas said.\nBo looked up from fiddling with the straps on his fake leg. “They’re\nout there about a mile off. Watching us as we watch them.”\n“Is it a trap?” Tamas asked.\n“Not enough men for it to be a trap,” Bo said. “Not unless they\nbrought Brude with them.”\nTamas looked at Nila, who was watching the darkness silently, then\nback at Bo. He took a step closer to Bo. “I’m sorry,” he said.\n“Hmm?”\n“I’m sorry I sent Taniel to kill you.”\nBo looked surprised, then like he might laugh. “Don’t be. It’s in your\nnature. If our positions had been reversed, I would have done the same.\nOw!”\nNila had kicked Bo in his one remaining shin.\n“Well,” Bo said. “I would have.”\n“It’s rude to say so,” Nila chided.\n“Which one of you is the apprentice?” Tamas asked.\nBo sniffed. “Not another word, old man.”\nTamas watched Bo. “You haven’t called me that since you were\nfifteen.”\n“And it’s all the more applicable now.”\n“You’re still a bratty upstart.”\n“Yes.” Bo grinned. “I do my best.”\n“Thank you as well for convincing Taniel not to go after Ka-poel\nhimself.”\n“He was champing at the bit.” Bo looked off to the north, where Taniel\nnow crouched in another such grove, his rifle aimed at Claremonte’s\nrepresentatives still waiting down the road. “I’m hoping he doesn’t shoot\none of them tonight.”\n“Me too.”\n“They have Privileged with them, by the way.”"

It gave Tamas an uneasy feeling.\n“Don’t tell me you’re thinking about revenge.”\n“I really miss my leg. And she’s down there. The one who did this to\nme. I can tell. And I recognize her now. Her name’s Lourie. We’ve got a\nlittle bit of history.”\n“Is there a woman in any of the cabals of the Nine that you don’t have\na history with?” Nila asked.\n“A few,” Bo replied.\nTamas swore. “You better not jeopardize this entire operation.”\nBo made a calming gesture. “Of course not. I’ll keep myself reined in,\nthank you. Here they come.”\nTamas put powder on his tongue to increase his trance a little, and\nwatched as the group on the road split in two, the smaller half coming\nacross the farmer’s field toward their hiding spot. Tamas called quietly for\nOlem and they walked out of the grove.\nThe Privileged at their head was a woman he had not met before. She\nhad pale skin, large eyes, and hair so blond it might have been white. She\nwas wearing her gloves, and she eyed Tamas suspiciously.\n“Mage,” she said.\n“Privileged.”\n“You have something for us?”\n“I do.”\n“And we, for you.” The woman raised her hand, and a figure was\nbrought forward. Tamas stifled a sigh of relief at the sight of Vlora. Her\nuniform was ripped and dirty, one cheek scraped raw and one eye bruised,\nbut she was still alive.\n“What are you trading for me?” she demanded.\n“Nothing I want to keep,” Tamas said. Olem went to Vlora’s side,\ntaking her arm and leading her away from the Privileged and back toward\nthe grove.\nThe Brudanian Privileged raised one hand. “Your half of the bargain?”\n“Olem! Bring it out.”\nOlem disappeared into the grove with Vlora and came back a moment\nlater, alone.\n“Well?” Tamas asked.\n“She’s objecting strenuously to the deal.”\n“Would she rather go back with them?”\n“That’s what she says.”\n“I never wanted daughters, Olem. You can quote me on that.”\n“I’m growing impatient, mage,” the Brudanian Privileged growled.\n“I’m still here, aren’t I? Olem, go get it.”\nOlem returned to the grove. A few minutes later Tamas heard the\nsound of wooden wheels trundling over dirt, and soon a wagon came into\nview from around the opposite side of the grove. It was pulled by two oxen\nand had a stone sarcophagus in the bed.

Or your pet Privileged hiding\nin the grove? I’ve already fought him once. He’d be dead if I hadn’t been in\na hurry and feeling generous. Tell Borbador that he owes me his life.”\n“I think you are afraid. Otherwise you’d have tried it already. Get out\nof here, Privileged dog. Take Kresimir back to your master. Remind him to\nkeep his word.”\nOne of the soldiers took the reins to the wagon and the Privileged\nturned away. “He’ll keep whatever he desires. Even this miserable country.”\nTamas watched until the Privileged were long gone before he returned\nto the grove.\n“You shouldn’t have done that,” Vlora said.\n“I’ve done a lot of things I shouldn’t. This isn’t one of them.” Tamas\nleaned over and kissed her on the forehead. “It was worth it. Bo, that\nPrivileged sends her regards.”\n“I bet she does.”\n“Bo,” Tamas continued.\n“What?”\n“A fight is coming. I can feel it. If you see her again, wipe the floor\nwith her.”\nBo’s fingers flexed, his jaw clenching, and he exchanged a glance with\nNila. “That would be my pleasure.”\nAdamat sat on the northern section of Adopest’s old wall, his feet dangling\noff the thirty-foot precipice.\nHe crunched into an apple, feeling the juice run down his chin as he\nwatched the Brudanian troop transports load by the evening light. The\nlargest oceangoing ships had already set off up the Ad River, hauled against\nthe current by teams of twenty oxen each on their long journey to the lock\nsystem over the mountains, while the troop barges were still only half full.\n“I confess,” he mused aloud, “that I’m shocked to see him leaving.”\nSouSmith didn’t reply. The big boxer leaned against the battlements.\nHe wore a butcher’s canvas pants and white shirt, the bloodstained sleeves\nrolled up to his elbows. He removed a pipe from his shirt pocket and lit it\nwith a match, puffing to get it lit. A few moments later the air was full of\nthe sweet smell of cherry tobacco.\n“He hasn’t,” SouSmith finally pointed out.\n“True, true. The man himself is still here. But the fact that he is\nkeeping his word about his soldiers boggles my mind.”\n“Think he’s up to somethin’?”"

He’s a salesman and a politician. If he’s not up to\nsomething I’ll eat my boots.” Adamat felt in his pockets for a moment\nbefore remembering that he’d left his own pipe at home. He eyed the troop\ntransports as the Brudanians filed onboard, then looked down the Ad to the\nsouth. From this position it was impossible to see where Kresim Cathedral\nonce stood, but he remembered its destruction as starkly as he remembered\neverything else.\n“He left his mark,” SouSmith said.\n“Yes. Yes he did.” And so many unanswered questions as well.\nClaremonte claimed that everything he had done was only to mitigate the\ndamage Kresimir could do. It didn’t feel like an outright lie, but even an\nidiot could see that Claremonte had only his own gain in mind. The First\nMinistry of Adro seemed like such a pitiful goal for a god. Was there\nsomething else he wanted? Something greater?\nAnd where was Brude’s other half? Who was Brude’s other half? He\nhad played off of Tamas’s ambitions from the very beginning, which\nsuggested someone inside the council. The thought sent chills up Adamat’s\nspine. Lady Winceslav? The Reeve? Perhaps it was Tamas himself! The\nthought was enough to give him a stroke, but he knew he had to dig deeper.\nLord Vetas had worked at cross-purposes to Tamas and the council.\nWhat had he once said? One hand not knowing what the other is doing? As\nfar as Adamat knew, Vetas had done nothing to prevent Kresimir’s return.\nIn fact, he had been working with Charlemund, who by all accounts had\nknown about Kresimir’s return. An accident? Or on purpose?\n“I have a hunch,” Adamat said.\n“Huh?”\n“Come with me to Sablethorn tonight. Do you have time?”\nSouSmith glanced down at his clothes.\n“Go get changed,” Adamat said. “Meet me at Sablethorn in two\nhours.”\nSouSmith descended from the wall, leaving Adamat alone.\nAdamat kicked his heels against the stone wall, watching as the first of\nthe transports left, considering his options. He had to rule out the central\nmembers of the council. If Brude’s other half was one of the council, he\nwould have done far more damage than he already had.\nHe waited until the last of the transports had left before he got to his\nfeet and headed down to the main street to find a hackney cab. Thirty\nminutes later he arrived at Sablethorn, and the sun set over his shoulder as\nhe went through the main doors and approached the guard station on the\nfirst floor. SouSmith sat in the stone hallway, back to the wall, hat tipped\nover his face.\n“I’m here to see Lady Cheris,” Adamat said to the guard on duty.\nSouSmith climbed to his feet, and the prison guard checked Adamat’s\npapers before letting them through.\n“I think Claremonte has another agent in the city.”\n“You think?”"

But I mean another agent of the\nsame rank or higher than Lord Vetas. Someone working autonomously.\nCompletely apart from Vetas or Claremonte.” The other half of the god,\nAdamat thought silently.\n“Why?”\n“We interviewed Claremonte with a Knacked who could see through\nlies, and Claremonte didn’t know anything about the attack on Ricard’s\nheadquarters. But no one benefits more than he with Ricard dead. If\nClaremonte has another agent in the city, working independently, it explains\nwhy he could truthfully say he didn’t plan the attack.”\n“Lady Cheris?”\n“I think that Cheris might know who it is.”\nThey reached a room near the top of the spire and Adamat paused to\ncatch his breath while the jailer unlocked the ironbound door. They were\nadmitted to a small but comfortable room with a fireplace, two lanterns, a\nbed, chair, and side table.\nLady Cheris stood beside the window, looking out onto Elections\nSquare. She glanced curiously at Adamat but remained silent while the\njailer lit the lanterns and then left.\n“Lady Cheris,” Adamat said.\nShe waved her hand without looking away from the window. “I’ve told\nyou everything you’re going to get from me,” she said.\n“I don’t think you have. Who are you working for?” Adamat asked.\n“Me? Working for someone? Hah! You must not know me very well,\nInspector. I’m no one’s stooge.”\n“So you claim you plotted Ricard’s fall all on your own?”\nShe remained silent.\n“If you help me, I might be able to keep you away from the\nguillotine,” Adamat said.\n“I don’t believe that they will send me to the guillotine, Inspector. And\neven if they did, you don’t have that kind of power.”\nAdamat felt a cold sweat break out on his brow. He blinked several\ntimes, then rubbed his hand over his eyes. “Can you risk that?”\n“I’ve risked everything, and I’ve lost. This conversation is over.”\nAdamat’s throat was dry. He stared at Cheris for several moments until\nshe turned to face him.\n“What is it, Inspector? Can’t think of something to say? Am I a dead\nend? Forgive me for not showing any sympathy. You can tell Ricard I’ll be\nthe downfall of him yet.”\nAdamat found his voice and stood up, managing a half bow. “I’m sorry\nfor wasting what little time you have left, my lady.”\nOut in the hallway, Adamat gestured for the jailer to lock the door. He\nleaned against the wall, shivering.\n“Adamat?” SouSmith said.\nAdamat drew the jailer to the side and gave him a hundred-krana note.\n“Let me be clear. You are not to let Lady Cheris out of that room. But if she\ndoes get out, you are not to stand in her way. Your life may depend on it.\nTell the field marshal I gave you those instructions.”\nAdamat found himself running down the stairs, with SouSmith"

Your life may depend on it.\nTell the field marshal I gave you those instructions.”\nAdamat found himself running down the stairs, with SouSmith\nhurrying to keep up. Outside, Adamat practically leapt into his waiting\nhackney cab. “Go home, SouSmith,” he said. “I think we’re done here.\nYou’ve been the greatest of help.” He banged on the roof. “Across the\nsquare,” he ordered, and they took off, leaving SouSmith with a confused\nexpression outside of Sablethorn.\nAdamat ran up all five flights of stairs to the top of the People’s Court,\nhis lungs near to bursting when he reached the top. He showed his papers to\nTamas’s soldiers and ignored the secretary who told him to wait, shoving\nhis way into Tamas’s office. His chest was tight, and he was spurred on by\nsudden fear.\nTamas looked up from his desk, where he was reading by the light of a\nlantern. “Inspector?”\n“Lady Cheris,” Adamat gasped. “She doesn’t have a shadow. She’s\nBrude’s other half. And that’s not all.”\nTamas shot to his feet. “Tell me.”\n“Claremonte’s troop transports are riding high in the water. He’s left\nbehind at least five hundred men.”\nCHAPTER 48\nT\nhe election was held early on the morning of the last day of autumn.\nAdamat stood near the window of Ricard’s office in the Kinnen Hotel.\nTo his great consternation, he was unable to keep from wringing his hands\nas he watched the constant flow of people passing in the street below. Today\nwas the second of two days of a national holiday. The polls had been\nopened at six in the morning the day before and had closed well after\nmidnight. A delegation of Novi vote counters had spent all night with the\nballots. By noon, word should come back on the results of the election.\nAnd then they’d find out if a god could keep his word.\nThere was so much left unanswered. Adamat didn’t like the loose\nends. No explanation of Claremonte’s involvement in the Kez-Adran War,\nor Cheris allowing herself to be imprisoned, or even why Claremonte cared\nabout the election in Adro to begin with.\nIt was giving him heart palpitations.\nHe heard the door behind him open, and the sounds of Ricard’s\nelection party floated in. Adamat turned to see Privileged Borbador slip\ninside the room. It was the first time Adamat had seen him since he returned\nto Adopest. He walked confidently with a cane despite the prosthetic on his\nleft leg, and he was dressed well enough to make a banker blush. He wore\nhis Privileged’s gloves despite, or perhaps because of, the heavy crowds at\nthe election party.\nTheir eyes met and the half-patronizing, half-predatory smile that Bo\nhad plastered on his face for the party slid off to be replaced by a somber\nvisage. “Our deal is complete.”\nAdamat swallowed a lump in his throat. “You’re sure?”\n“Nila killed a Black Warden in Brude’s Hideaway. It was missing its\nring finger. Looked like it had been nothing more than a boy, around fifteen"

I can’t be more certain than that.”\n“You saw it yourself ?”\n“I was there when it happened.”\n“Did —?”\n“It was quick.”\n“Thank you.”\nBo gave him a short nod and slipped out of the room. Adamat took a\ndeep breath, steadying himself. Josep was at peace. Adamat could now be at\npeace as well. Or at least he could try.\nHe didn’t have time to think through his grief. He heard Bo exchange\nwords with a familiar voice outside the door, then it opened again and Fell\nappeared in the doorway. She looked him up and down, then stepped back\noutside. “He’s in here!” he heard her shout.\nRicard entered the room a moment later, mopping his brow with his\nhandkerchief. “Pit, that’s a lot of hands to shake. Adamat, what are you\ndoing up here? Your wife is looking everywhere for you, and Astrit got\naway from her nanny and has been terrorizing the kitchen staff.”\nAdamat shook himself out of his thoughts. “I’m terribly sorry, Ricard,\nI’m coming.”\n“I joke, I joke! Your children are angels. All except that orphan kid,\nwhat was his name?”\n“Jakob.”\n“Jakob keeps going into the basement to play with what’s left of my\nwine collection.”\n“He’s a good lad.”\n“He might be. But keep him out of my wine.”\n“I thought you hired more than one nanny?”\n“I did. Not enough, apparently. You already have too many children.\nWhy did you have to take on a stray?”\n“Faye wants to adopt him,” Adamat mused aloud. He wondered\nwhether this was Faye’s way of dealing with Josep’s death, or whether she\ngenuinely cared for the Eldaminse child. It was something they’d agreed to\ntalk about later. Only a handful of people even knew of his importance, but\nAdamat worried about the possible ramifications of adopting the closest\nliving heir to the Adran throne.\n“How is Faye holding up?” Adamat asked.\n“She’s been yakking with the new head of the tailors’ union. What’s\nher name again? Maggie?”\n“Margy. I’m glad you picked her.”\n“I can’t really account for your taste. She hates my guts.”\n“It’s good to have some opposition,” Adamat said. “I’m sure she’ll\ncome around.”\n“You’re too confident. Anyway, I’m glad you’re alone. I want to talk\nto you.”\n“Oh?”\n“How would you like a job?”\nAdamat swayed on his feet. “Ricard, you know I’d do anything for\nyou. But I’m exhausted. I’m getting too old to run all over the city. The\nmoney from you and Privileged Borbador will keep us alive for a while. If I\ntold Faye I had another investigation job, she’d skin me alive.”\n“Investigating? Pit, Adamat. I want you to be on my staff.”\nAdamat sensed some kind of a trap. “Isn’t that conditional upon your\nwinning the election?”\n“Well. Yes.”"

Yes.”\n“I see.” Adamat hesitated. “I’d have to ask Faye.”\n“Well, she’d be hypocritical to say no.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I offered her a job on my staff already and she said yes. The position\ncomes with full-time nannies for the children and a lot of foreign travel. If I\nhire you both, you can take those trips together.”\nAdamat tried to blink away his exhaustion. “She did? I… well. I\nsuppose I could do that.”\n“You suppose?” Ricard thumped him on the back. “Have a little\nenthusiasm. I wouldn’t let you say no.”\n“You seem awfully confident in a win.”\n“Pit, no. I think I’m going to lose, Adamat. Pretty confident, actually.\nBut I’m a little drunk right now, and I’ve done everything I can. No sense in\nworrying over it anymore. See you downstairs?”\nAdamat gave his friend a crooked smile and watched him stumble out\nthe door. Fell remained there a moment longer.\n“Fell,” Adamat said as she followed Ricard out.\n“Yes sir?”\n“Thanks for taking care of him.”\n“It’s my job, sir.”\n“And sober him up a bit.”\n“Next on the list. I have more confidence in his winning than he does.”\nAdamat was alone for only a couple of minutes before he heard\nsomeone else enter the room. He turned, a smile on his lips, expecting that\nFaye had come looking for him finally. Instead he found Taniel Two-shot\nstanding with his back pressed up against the door, a look of terror in his\neyes.\nAdamat frowned and listened for some kind of commotion downstairs.\nThe sound of the party continued on, and then he realized, “You’re not used\nto this kind of thing, are you?”\n“I’m going to break the next person who asks me to shake their hand.”\n“You look tired.”\n“I am.” Taniel wore a new dress uniform, his colonel’s pins at his\ncollar, his hat under one arm. “Haven’t slept in about six days.”\n“That’s enough to kill a man,” Adamat said, stepping forward. Perhaps\nhe should call for Fell. Taniel was potentially less than an hour away from\nbeing Adopest’s new Second Minister and he had a wide-eyed unsteadiness\nto him that said he’d either run off after his lover or pass out at any\nmoment.\nTaniel waved him off. “I can’t do it. I can’t keep shaking hands and\nsmiling at sycophants while the pressure builds. We may have another war\non our hands the moment the election ends, and no one seems to care. This\ntime we won’t have a god on our side. And Claremonte still has Ka-poel.”\n“No one knows about Brude,” Adamat said. “Except for us.”\n“Ricard knows. How does he keep going on with the farce?”\n“Habit?”\nTaniel looked at him sharply. “Do you think this is over? This whole\nthing with Claremonte? Will he really just walk away?”\n“I don’t know.”"

Taniel leapt away, then put a finger to his\nlips, shaking his head.\nAdamat rolled his eyes. He opened the door a crack. It was Fell.\n“It’s almost time,” Fell said. “Ricard needs Taniel Two-shot.”\nAdamat gave her a nod and closed the door. He stepped over, taking\nTaniel under the arm. “Let’s go.”\nTaniel allowed himself to be dragged down to the hotel lobby by Inspector\nAdamat.\nHe thought about fighting the man off and finding a closet to hide in,\nbut he knew that wouldn’t be what most people called “mature.” Instead, he\ntried to take Bo’s advice and put a smile on his face as they reached the\nmain floor.\nBehind the smile, his mind raced. Ka-poel was still with Claremonte.\nIf he lost the election, would he kill her? Would he release her? Would he\ndo either of those if he won? There was no way to know, and he was going\nmad. Something needed to happen.\nAdamat slipped off to the dining room, where Ricard was holding\ncourt, leaving Taniel to greet the constantly flowing river of well-wishers.\nHe didn’t know any of their names, but they all seemed satisfied with a\nhandshake and a kind word muttered from behind gritted teeth.\n“I’ve seen that look before. You look like a hare cornered by a pack of\nhounds,” a voice said from behind him.\n“I’m glad to see you’re doing better,” he said.\nVlora stepped up beside him and returned a passing merchant’s smile.\n“Me too. For the record, I don’t think Tamas should have made the trade.”\nShe hooked her arm into his and he stiffened, but he let her lead him into\none of the hotel’s sitting rooms, where local officials spoke quietly over\ntheir drinks, out of the main hubbub of the crowd.\n“I do.”\n“You’re both idiots, then.”\n“Were you treated well?”\nVlora gave him a flat look. “Don’t try to change the subject.”\nTaniel shrugged. “Kresimir’s fate is out of my hands. Handing over the\nbody was Tamas’s call. I had no input.”\n“I know.” Vlora let out a sigh and met his eyes, watching him silently\nfor a long time. “I miss you.”\nTaniel hesitated. “I miss you too.”\n“Is there any chance things could ever go back to the way they were?”\nTaniel had to confess that from time to time the same question had\noccurred to him. He remembered their childhood and their courtship, going\nthrough training together, stealing off to be alone, and all the time they\nspent together. But the fragile thread that had held them together had been\nsnapped, and there was nothing that could mend it. “I don’t think so. Ka-\npoel. She and I…”\n“Yeah.”\nWhat if Ka-poel dies? Vlora didn’t ask the question out loud, but he\nknew it had crossed her mind. He didn’t even want to consider it."

He didn’t even want to consider it.\n“I saw your savage,” Vlora said.\nTaniel turned. “Is she all right?” The panic he felt for her kept rising to\nthe surface and he had to fight it back down. Tamas had told him how\nimportant it was to play Claremonte’s game, and only a direct order and\nassurances that contingencies had been made kept Taniel from running off\nto try to rescue her.\n“As far as I could tell.” Vlora gave him a sad smile. “If the opportunity\ncomes up, I’ll help you get her back.”\n“Thanks.” Taniel reached out and squeezed her shoulder. There was a\npart of him that wanted to hold her, that knew that she would welcome it.\nHe shook his head to banish the thought. “Vlora, I…”\nShe held up a hand and he fell silent, frowning. She tilted her head,\nand it took a couple of moments before Taniel caught on. The chatter from\nthe foyer and dining room had died down. “The results?” she asked.\nThey left the sitting room to find the crowd from the foyer huddled\naround the entrance to the dining room, and Taniel had to elbow his way\nthrough. He reached the center of the dining room to discover a messenger\nin a powdered wig, white frock coat, trousers, and black riding boots\nstanding between Ricard and Fell. Taniel tried to melt back into the\naudience, but Ricard had spotted him. Ricard beckoned eagerly and Taniel\nfelt himself pushed forward.\nTumblar’s brow shone with a sheen of sweat and his eyes looked tired.\nHe took Taniel by the arm and directed him to his right hand.\nOne of the hotel’s kitchen lads brought in a wooden crate and the\nmessenger climbed up, while Fell clinked a spoon on her glass.\n“Ladies and gentlemen!” the messenger said. “It is my honor as\nrepresentative of the vote counters to reveal the identity of the First\nMinister of Adro.” He paused, removing an envelope from his jacket and\nbreaking the seal.\nTaniel licked his lips, wishing he had something to drink, and wiped\nhis palms on his trousers.\n“I am pleased to announce that the First Minister of Adro… is the\nhonorable Ricard Tumblar!”\nA cheer went up through the crowd more deafening than cannon fire.\nTaniel stumbled as Ricard suddenly grabbed him in an embrace. His hand\nwas snatched by a dozen different people and shaken until he thought his\narm would come off at the elbow. He heard a cork pop, and a champagne\nglass was thrust into his hand and then immediately taken away so he could\nshake hands with someone else. Congratulations were shouted in his ear\nand he was shoved around the room by well-wishers until he thought he\nmight snap at any moment.\nThe silence that suddenly swept through the room hit Taniel like a\npunch to the gut. Someone’s laugh cut through it, then dissipated\nawkwardly. Taniel blinked away the haze of the excitement as the crowd\nscattered and Lord Claremonte stepped into the dining room.\nClaremonte was dressed in the sharpest of black suits with tails, a top"

Taniel blinked away the haze of the excitement as the crowd\nscattered and Lord Claremonte stepped into the dining room.\nClaremonte was dressed in the sharpest of black suits with tails, a top\nhat held in one hand. His eye wandered lazily over the assembled guests\nand he lifted his hands to gently clap. “I see that the messengers reached me\nfaster than they did you.”\nRicard gazed back at Claremonte warily. Taniel put his hand on the hilt\nof his smallsword and set his jaw. Tamas’s stern command to hold it\ntogether kept running through his brain.\n“You know the results?” Ricard asked.\n“If I didn’t already, I do now. I heard the cheering from the streets.”\nTaniel could hear nothing but the pounding of his own heart. The room\nwas deathly silent, and though the guests didn’t know Claremonte’s true\nnature, there was a palpable air about him that threatened danger. Taniel\ncaught Vlora’s eye, and saw the pistol in her belt half drawn.\n“And,” Claremonte continued, “well earned, I say.” He swept one leg\nback in a graceful bow. “Congratulations, Mr. First Minister, and to you,\nSecond Minister. I wish you all the greatest success!” He stepped forward\nsuddenly and shook Ricard’s hand, ignoring the shocked look on Tumblar’s\nface.\n“You’ll be leaving the city, then?” Taniel asked, his voice low.\nClaremonte met his eye, the corner of his mouth lifted slightly. “As I\ngave my word. I just have a few things to wrap up before I go. Well done,\nMr. Two-shot. Enjoy your victory.”\nClaremonte was gone before Taniel could respond. He withdrew\ngraciously, offering congratulations to Ricard’s staff and waving all the way\nout the door. Slowly, the conversation resumed, and Taniel pulled himself\nout of the middle of the room and made his way over to Vlora. Just as he\nreached her, he heard another champagne cork pop and turned to find\nRicard holding the foaming bottle.\n“Fell,” Ricard shouted. “Tell Tamas to start the parade!”\nTaniel gripped the hilt of his sword and turned to Vlora. “Get to your\nposition.”\nTamas lay his hand on the neck of his charger to calm the horse as it\nstepped nervously in place at the head of a long column of sharply dressed\nAdran soldiers. The column snaked along the main road leading out of\nAdopest in the midst of a great crowd.\nHe could sense the excitement of his men. Though every one of them\nstood at parade rest with feet apart and eyes forward, bayoneted rifles\ndown, he could feel the buzz of energy that emanated from and surrounded\nthem as Adran citizens gathered along the streets ahead laughed and\nchildren ran up and down the sides of the column, throwing garlands of\nfresh flowers, trying to loop them around the bayonets.\n“Field Marshal Tamas!” a voice shouted above the din.\nTamas looked up, and it was Olem, who pointed out one of Ricard’s\nmen riding toward them down the main avenue out of the city. The man\nshouted, but his voice was drowned out by the mob of revelers."

Ricard\nTumblar is the First Minister of Adro! Lord Claremonte has admitted\ndefeat.” Tamas could hear the news being relayed by the citizens lining the\nstreet and watched the exclamations and the curses. There was a clamor as\nthe information was spread, opinions barked back and forth. A fistfight\nbroke out, but was quickly put down by the people themselves.\nTamas exchanged a look with Olem, and could see his own optimistic\ntrepidation reflected in the bodyguard. “Well. That’s that, then.”\n“We hope,” Olem said.\n“We hope,” Tamas echoed. “Colonel, if you’ll do the honors.”\nOlem pointed to a nearby drummer boy, and a long, steady beat\nsuddenly broke through the noise. People all along the road paused in their\ncelebrations.\n“General Arbor, the parade is at your command.”\nGeneral Arbor swung his horse around to face the column behind\nthem. “Parade!” he bellowed. “Attention!” The sound of five thousand pairs\nof boots shuffling together rang out as every man came to attention. “Parade\nadvance!” The drummer boy clicked his sticks four times on the rim of his\nsnare, then snapped out the beat, and the column moved forward.\nTamas sat straight on his charger, sword over his right shoulder, as\nthey marched into the crowded city streets, the path clearing ahead of them.\nHe could hear happy shouts, and saw flower garlands thrown from the tops\nof buildings to float down onto the marching soldiers.\nThe parade led through the Factory District and the New City, winding\nup and down a dozen streets as the people cheered and waved. Women\nreached out to touch the soldiers as they passed, and men shouted\ncongratulations. Tamas saw more than one tavern owner running up and\ndown the column to tell the soldiers they could drink for free all night at his\npub.\nTamas kept his back straight and his bearing regal, but he watched the\ncrowds and the shop windows and the rooftops with trepidation. Every time\nhe thought he could give in to his pride and let himself relax, he felt as if\nhostile eyes were on his back. He tried to tell himself that old instincts\nnever died. He tried to tell himself that it was finally over.\nThe parade proceeded toward the bridge over the Ad River, and Tamas\nraised his fist at the sight before him.\n“Parade halt!” General Arbor yelled.\nThe brigade came to a stop and Tamas eyed the lone wagon abandoned\nin the middle of the road not far from the bridge. He felt his hand creeping\ntoward the butt of his pistol and could see Olem’s sword half drawn.\n“Orders, sir?” Olem said.\n“Wait.” Tamas glanced at the surrounding buildings. There was no sign\nof ambush, no Brudanian uniforms flashing in windows.\nSuddenly, a dozen revelers ran out into the street and surrounded the\nwagon.

The balcony of Tamas’s\noffice – now the office of the First Minister of Adro – was festooned with\nAdran blue and red, banners stamped with the teardrop symbol of the Adsea\ndraped halfway down the building.\nThe crowd was cleared away from the middle of the square as the\nparade marched in and fell into rank before the People’s Court. Tamas\nlooked up to see Ricard Tumblar on the balcony, decked out in his finest\nsuit, Taniel standing beside him looking somber in his uniform.\nTamas let a smile crack his stony visage.\n“Sir?” Olem asked.\n“My son. Second Minister of Adro. Strange twist of fate.”\n“He doesn’t look happy about it.”\n“He’s not. Not at all. He’ll keep his promise, though.” He had better,\nTamas added mentally.\nThe soldiers had fallen in, and a hush descended on the square, quieter\nthan the day Tamas had stood on that same balcony and announced to the\ncrowd that the reign of Manhouch was over. Tamas let out a slow breath,\nblinking away the wonder, and realized that he’d now come full circle. The\nplans of so many years had finally come to fruition.\n“Is it over, Olem?” he asked, hearing the emotion in his own voice. “Is\nit finally over?”\nOlem didn’t answer. Ricard had raised his hands. “People of Adro!\nFriends! Brothers! Sisters! I’m humbled to stand before you today as your\nnew First Minister.” The cheers lasted for several minutes before Ricard\ncould finally speak again. “My friends, the tyranny of kings is over. The\ndoubt and anticipation of the last eight months of tragic war is over. Today,\non the last day of autumn, we have become a republic. I am proud to be\nhere, the first among equals.\n“My friends, none of this would have been possible without the\nextraordinary efforts of the Protector of Adro, Field Marshal Tamas, and his\npowder mages and soldiers. You owe them your freedom. Your lives. Your\nlove.”\nThe cheers were deafening. Tamas felt a tear roll down his cheek, but\nhe did not move to wipe it away. He kept his eyes fixed on Ricard.\n“My friends! I…”\nA sound reverberated across the square, cutting Ricard off and causing\na stir among the gathered crowd.\n“My friends,” Ricard started again.\nThe groaning and creaking continued, and Tamas turned to see the\ncrowd chattering restlessly. A cloud cast a shadow over the assembled\nmasses, and Tamas removed his hat to look about him. Where was the\nsound coming from?\nThe groaning grew in intensity, and the slightest movement caught\nTamas’s eye as a creak gave way to the grinding of stone on stone.\n“Scatter!” he bellowed.\nSablethorn, the mighty prison of the Iron King, tilted and wobbled like"

He\nsat upon his horse transfixed, watching it descend upon him as if reality\nitself had slowed. His mouth opened, and he stared for a moment before he\nwas suddenly jerked to the side as his horse bolted, and he looked to see\nOlem galloping ahead, Tamas’s reins in his hands.\nHe twisted in his saddle to see the spire topple, the structure crumbling\nas it fell. Black basalt blocks the size of oxen tumbled across Elections\nSquare. The tip of the spire smashed through the balcony and ripped\nthrough the front of the People’s Court.\nTamas jerked his reins from Olem’s hands and pulled up, whirling\ntoward the destruction. “Taniel!”\nHe threw his arms up to protect his face as the dust cloud enveloped\nhim.\nCHAPTER 49\n“I\nnside, inside!” Taniel yelled, grabbing Ricard’s delegates and advisers\nand shoving them through the balcony door into the office. “Run!”\nA female voice screamed, “Ricard!” and Taniel turned to see Adro’s\nFirst Minister gaping at the black spire as it plummeted toward him. Taniel\ndashed across the balcony, snatched Ricard by the shoulders, and lifted him\nbodily, plowing both of them through the glass of the balcony window and\ninto the office behind it. They landed in a heap among a shower of glass.\nTaniel rolled them both across the floor to get farther away from the\nwindow, looking up in time to see the black stone slam through the balcony\nwhere they’d just been standing. The air erupted into a blast of plaster dust.\nTaniel felt a surge of sorcery so close it tickled the back of his neck,\nand he threw Ricard off of him. He leapt to his feet, sword in hand, only to\nfind Bo standing near the office fireplace with his fake leg braced, hands\noutstretched.\n“Taniel,” Nila said. “You should move.”\nTaniel looked around, then up, to find the roof above him split by the\nspire’s capstone, a black chunk of basalt the size of a small house\nsuspended just above his head. Ricard was on his feet now and Taniel\nshoved him back, out of the way.\nBo grunted, and rolled his gloved fingers. The stone lifted and was\nflung out into Elections Square.\nRicard brushed himself off. “There are people down there!”\n“People up here, too, and I wasn’t gonna hold that very long,” Bo said.\nRicard seemed to think better about arguing with Bo and instead called\nfor Fell. “Is everyone safe?”\n“I think so.” Adamat’s voice came out of the gloom of the dust.\n“Downstairs, quickly,” Ricard said. “There will be people trapped\nbeneath the rubble. Dear Adom, what the pit happened? Was that an\naccident?”\nTaniel followed Ricard out into the hallway where the dust had begun\nto clear, and Adamat was pale as a ghost. “No,” Adamat said. “That was no"

Brude’s other half was in Sablethorn.”\nTaniel froze in his steps. “Fell. Get my rifle. Now!” He began to run\ntoward the stairs, everything else forgotten. If Brude was down there,\nwhatever half it was, there would be no one to stop him. Taniel didn’t think\neven he could do much, but he remembered Kresimir’s blood on his\nknuckles. If he really was a god-killer, then he might be the only one who\ncould do anything.\nTaniel felt something hit him from behind, knocking the breath from\nhim and slamming both him and his attacker against the wall. He threw the\nother person away from him and struggled to his feet, only to find Nila\ncrouched beside him, both her bare hands wreathed in blue flame.\nThe sorcery that cut through the air where he had just been standing\nhad sliced a cannonball-sized hole in the floor and the ceiling. The blast had\ncome from beneath him, and he could sense multiple Privileged somewhere\nbelow. Taniel scrambled along on his hands and knees. “Back to the office!”\nhe yelled.\nBo, crouching awkwardly with his prosthetic, snatched him by the\nsleeve. “Get your rifle and take the back stairs. They’ll need you out there.\nI’ll take care of this.”\n“You’re sure?”\n“Trust me.” Bo slapped him on the shoulder, and Taniel ran back down\nthe hallway, taking his rifle from Fell and fixing the bayonet as he ran,\npassing through two doors until he reached the servants’ stairwell behind\nRicard’s new office.\nHe took the stairs a flight at a time, leaping like a madman from\nlanding to landing. At the bottom he ran down a short hallway and kicked a\nside door open, then sprinted out into the dust-filtered sunlight. He stood\nblinking for several moments, trying to get his bearings, when the\nconcussion of an immense blast threw him straight back into the building.\n“She’s down there, Nila. The bitch who took my leg.”\nNila was about to ask how Bo knew, but the awareness at the edge of\nher newfound sorcerous senses told her enough. There were Privileged two\nfloors beneath them. Their presence was muted in the Else, as if they’d been\ntaking great care to conceal themselves, but they were most certainly there.\nAnd based on what Bo had told her about cabal Privileged, they probably\nhad a company of soldiers with them as well.\n“What do we have protecting the People’s Court?” she asked.\nBo responded, “Two companies of Adran soldiers.”\n“They’ll get torn to ribbons by three Privileged.”\n“Five Privileged. And I agree.”\nNila tried to think of who they could depend on to help them, and\nfound a knot in her stomach. She and Bo were the Adran Cabal. And\nTamas’s powder mages had their hands full with whatever power had just\ntoppled Sablethorn. Her heart thundered in her ears.

After watching the top of Sablethorn destroy the\nbalcony and nearly flatten Taniel, she felt as exposed as if she were stripped\nnaked. “What do we do?” she asked. “Follow Taniel out the back?”\n“Good idea. Get everyone out that way as quickly as possible, and\nhope that their soldiers haven’t already cut us off. This is my fight.”\n“This is our fight,” Nila corrected. “Fell! Get everyone out the back.\nEmpty the top floor if you can, because there’s no going this way.”\nRicard’s secretary gave a sharp nod and began to urge the people back\ndown the hallway.\n“You sure you’re here with me?” Bo asked.\n“Of course, you fool. I’m your responsibility now. Who the pit else is\ngoing to teach me how to be the best Privileged of the century?”\n“This isn’t a few thousand Adran infantry. These are cabal Privileged.”\nNila swallowed hard. “I know.”\n“All right. Here we go.” Bo climbed to his feet, his prosthetic jerking\nand wobbling beneath him. “Lourie! Hey, Lourie!”\n“Borbador!” A voice came back from downstairs. “Why aren’t you\nrunning yet? That last shot could have been for you, but I figured I’d give\nyou a sporting chance. Is your powder mage friend dead?”\n“You missed, actually.”\nThere was a pause. “That’s a pity.”\n“Lourie, do you have a favorite eye?”\n“What?”\n“Just answer the question,” Bo shouted.\n“Why?”\n“Because I’m going to keep that one in a jar after I strangle you with\nyour own entrails.”\n“What are you doing?” Nila hissed.\n“Just having a conversation,” Bo said. “What does it sound like?”\nLourie’s voice returned, “Oh, come now, Borbador. You weren’t using\nthat leg too much.”\n“You won’t be using your eye too much either.”\n“Bo,” Nila said. “What the pit is going on? Why aren’t they trying to\nkill us?”\n“Because they’re taking up positions. The moment we open up on each\nother, people are going to die. They want to be very certain it’s not them.”\nBo leaned back, closing his eyes, hands held out in front of him with one\nelbow on the marble banister for support. His fingers twitched and moved,\ntracing tiny patterns in the air.\n“What are you doing?”\n“A few quick wards,” Bo said. “And finding out where they’re all\npositioned.”\nNila could feel him tugging at the Else. Whereas her own experiences\nwith sorcery had been torrents of power pulled from the other side, Bo\nseemed to be threading the Else carefully, using just a trickle of sorcery for\nhis purposes. She couldn’t tell exactly what he was doing with the wards, or\neven how he was making them, but she marveled at the quick, almost casual\nprecision.\n“Borbador,” Lourie shouted, “why don’t you join the Brudanian cabal"

Silence followed for a moment, and Bo said, “I was also trying to\nfigure out which one was Lourie.”\n“I’ll take that as a no,” Lourie shouted up to them.\n“Damn it,” Bo grunted. “I missed. Run.”\nTamas struggled to his feet, coughing and choking, thrashing blindly in the\ndust that filled the air. He briefly spotted his charger running from the\nwreckage of Sablethorn, following the fleeing crowds of revelers, and\nchecked himself to be sure nothing was broken as a result of being thrown\noff his horse. He seemed whole, but his head was pounding and his left\nelbow didn’t want to bend.\nHow many had been crushed by the collapse? How many were dead,\nor trapped beneath the rubble?\nThe tower had been leaning ever since the earthquake many months\nbefore. Had this been a freak accident? He hoped – he prayed – that it was.\nBut instinct told him it had been arranged by Claremonte and that\nsomething else would follow. For now all he could do was regroup and\nprepare for the worst.\nTamas pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and tied it around his\nmouth against the dust. “Olem! Olem! Pit.”\n“Sir, are you all right?” It was General Arbor, emerging from the\nrubble, a soldier a quarter his age limping along with his help.\n“Fine, fine. Do we know how many are buried?”\n“I think most of us got away in time, though we can’t be sure. Lost my\ndamn teeth!”\n“Glad that’s all you lost. Have you seen Olem?”\n“No.”\nTamas was suddenly launched from his feet. One moment he was\nspeaking to Arbor and the next moment he was on the ground, his own\nvoice sounding distant as he shouted for a report. He shook his head, ears\nringing, trying to figure out what had happened. It felt, and sounded, like a\nmunitions depot had exploded beneath his feet.\nHis vision swam and his head pounded, the whole world sounding like\na muffled bell. He put his hands on his ears and hid his head, trying to\nregain his senses. With some effort he got to his feet.\nGeneral Arbor was up already, the body of the infantryman he had\nbeen helping crushed beneath a piece of basalt. Arbor’s face was red, and\nspittle flew as he barked commands that Tamas couldn’t hear. Arbor took\nhim by the elbow and Tamas pointed to his ears. The general nodded.\n“Sir.” The voice seemed small and distant, but Tamas turned to find\nOlem at his side. The bodyguard was coated in dust and splattered with\nblood, but it didn’t look like it was his own. “Sir, we’ve got to go! We’re\nunder attack!”\n“Who?”\nBefore Olem could answer, Arbor raised his hand and pointed toward"

We’re\nunder attack!”\n“Who?”\nBefore Olem could answer, Arbor raised his hand and pointed toward\nthe rubble of Sablethorn. Tamas flinched away from a sudden blinding\nlight, and he held up one hand as he tried to see. Slowly, the light faded and\nresolved itself into a glowing figure a dozen feet above the wreckage.\nSorcery swirled around her in white ribbons, and the clothes she wore\ndissolved beneath her own unveiled power.\nTamas gaped. Never had he seen anything like this. Not from Adom or\nfrom Julene or even from an entire royal cabal working in concert. He\ndidn’t recognize the woman, but he could guess all the same; this was\nCheris, Claremonte’s other half, the second face of the god Brude.\n“Get the people back!” Tamas shouted. “Arbor, bring my soldiers into\nline. I want everything you can give me. Rifles, artillery. Everything!”\n“Sir, we should retreat,” Olem said.\n“Blast your retreating. I fight here and I die here. Get to the brigades\nwaiting outside the city. Tell them to sack Claremonte’s headquarters at the\npalace. Kill everyone wearing a Brudanian uniform. For pit’s sake, avoid\nClaremonte himself!”\n“Sir, you can’t —”\n“That’s an order, man. Go!” As Olem sprinted away, Tamas drew his\npistol and leveled it at the god, squeezing the trigger. The bullet disappeared\ninto the swirling sorcery and had no visible effect. Tamas threw a powder\ncharge into his mouth and chewed, feeling the power course through his\nveins.\nThe god rotated toward him, her face serene. Tamas drew his other\npistol, aiming it at her eye, and pulled the trigger.\nShe was gone in the blink of an eye. Tamas stared hard at where she\nhad just been, his pistol still held warily before him. “Where’d she go?”\n“Here,” a voice whispered in his ear.\nHe whirled, but he was too slow. A hand like a steel vise closed around\nhis neck and he felt himself lifted in the air, the breath choked from him. He\nwas turned so that he looked into the eyes of the god.\n“I gave you a chance.” Her voice was silky and feminine, but with an\necho to it as if spoken inside the immense halls of a cathedral. He could\nhear the resonance of Claremonte within it. “I did not want this.” Tamas\nwas lifted higher. He grasped at the fingers holding him, but he might as\nwell have tried to pry away the unyielding hands of a marble statue. He\nstruggled with all his strength, the power of ten men flowing through his\nveins, but it was as nothing to this god.\nCheris shook him like a doll. “I did not want this,” she repeated. “I\nwanted to do this the easy way. I would have led Adro to greatness. I would\nhave united the Nine once again, toppled the rest of the monarchies,\nushering in a modern era of prosperity and unity.

I will unite the world. Even if I have to kill half the people on this\nplanet to do it.”\nTamas felt his eyes bulging, his mind screaming from the lack of\noxygen. He could feel his own struggles growing weaker. A bullet hit\nCheris in the cheek and shattered without leaving a mark, pieces of lead\nricocheting into Tamas’s shoulder.\n“You obstinate shit,” Cheris said. “I would have had you lead my\narmies. What a waste.” He felt her fingers squeeze and he knew any\nmoment his head would pop off his shoulders like the head of a dandelion\ntorn off its stem. He thrashed and tore, and out of the corner of his vision he\nsaw the swinging rifle stock.\nCheris did not.\nThe stock hit her in the side of the face hard enough to shatter the\nwhole length of the weapon. Her head jerked to the side, if only slightly,\nand she turned to face Vlora with a look of disgust. Tamas was thrown,\nsuddenly able to suck in a breath for only a moment before he hit Vlora and\nthe two of them rolled across the cobbles of the square.\nTamas gasped, air cutting like knives through his injured windpipe.\nVlora scrambled to her feet.\n“Don’t you see that this is just a game to me?” Cheris demanded. “Do\nyou not see how insignificant you are?”\nAndriya, covered in blood and gravel and dust and screaming like a\npit-born devil, ran at Cheris with his bayonet fixed. He thrust with enough\nforce to skewer a bull. The blade struck Cheris in the belly, bending like it\nwas made of rubber. Cheris twitched a finger and Andriya’s head exploded,\nshowering Tamas and Vlora in blood. The body stumbled and fell, neck still\nspurting crimson.\n“Fire!” Arbor’s voice bellowed.\nThe crack of two hundred muskets shattered the air, and Cheris turned\ntoward the sudden hail of bullets and faced the ranks of Adran soldiers, as\nunperturbed as a man walking into a gentle rain. She lifted her hands, and\nTamas opened his mouth to scream a warning to Arbor.\nTaniel ran at the goddess with all the speed he could coax out of his body.\nShe turned toward Arbor and the soldiers, and he knew that it would take\nher but a wink to do the same to them as she’d done to Andriya.\nHis fist connected with her chin and he heard an audible crack. The\ngoddess spun fully around from his blow, toppling to her knees. She\nshrugged off the punch – a punch that might have put down an elephant –\nand was back on her feet in a moment, her face an expression of shock and\noutrage.\nSo he punched her again.\nCheris’s head jerked back.

She doubled over and he brought his elbow down on her\nshoulder, dropping her to her knees. He drew his fist back, ready to come\ndown on the base of her spine.\nHer punch to his stomach felt like he’d been hit by the prow of a\nBrudanian ship of the line. He stumbled, blood trickling from the corner of\nhis mouth as he tried to regain his footing, but her second punch snapped\nhis head back, sending him soaring through the air. It was with great\nsurprise that he found himself still alive, forty feet away from the god. He\nstumbled to his feet, preparing to run at her again, but he could see that he\nnow had the goddess’s undivided attention.\nShe flexed one hand, and Taniel felt as if a steel cage had snapped in\nplace around him. His arms could barely move. His legs wouldn’t respond.\nThe sorcery closed in on him. His bones and muscles protested against the\npressure and it took all the strength he could summon to take one step\nforward.\nSweat poured off his brow and into his eyes. How was this possible?\nNot even Kresimir’s magic was this strong against the sorcery Ka-poel had\nwoven into Taniel’s bones. Was Brude really stronger than Kresimir? What\nif Ka-poel’s wards weren’t powerful enough to hold off this god’s power?\nHe took another step forward and felt a scream of agony wrench itself\nfrom his lips. His vision blurred. He could feel the sorcery pushing down on\nhim with the force of a mountain, but he knew that he had to end this. It was\nthe only way to get back Ka-poel.\nSuddenly the goddess was in front of him. He swung one fist and she\nstepped out of the way, catching his arm and slamming the tip of her finger\ninto his shoulder. He groaned and she reached out one hand, grasping his\nface, and threw him away from her with an angry grunt.\nShe raised her hands and leapt into the air. He waited for her to come\ndown upon him with the force of a mortar shell, but she stayed in the air,\nhovering well above his head. “Your lives are nothing to me.

Everything you’ve ever known and loved will die at once\nand there will be nothing you can do to stop it.

Go to the pit.”\nThe goddess laughed. She spread her arms, and the air began to\nshimmer. Taniel felt a sudden nausea in the pit of his stomach as his entire\nbody grew weightless.

She landed in a crouch and\nblinked at the world around her as the rubble and dust all settled back down\nto where it had once been. There were shouts of relief, and some of pain, as\nmen fell back to the ground.\n“What is this?” Cheris demanded.\nA figure appeared in the haze and the goddess turned to face it. Taniel\nsquinted, trying to make out its identity.\n“You’re dead,” the goddess said.\nThe figure was tall and fat, with black hair. One moment he looked\nlike Charlemund and the next like Mihali. His features warped and slid into\nsomething vaguely in between. He wore a white apron and a tall hat and\nstood with his hands on his hips.\n“You’re mistaken,” he said.\nTamas stumbled over to Adom, his senses still reeling from Cheris’s attack.\n“I’m glad to see you show up,” he said hoarsely.\nAdom didn’t respond. He raised his chin at Cheris and she sneered\nback.\n“Get out while I let you leave,” she hissed. “I’ve never been as fond of\nyou as my other half has.”\n“You’ve killed them all,” Adom said sadly. “I went looking for them.\nAll of our brothers and our sisters.

He turned to Tamas. “You should\ngo.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“To the palace. Claremonte – Brude – he’s going to kill Kresimir. You\ncan’t let that happen.”\n“But this…”\n“You won’t be any help here. Taniel’s the only one who can hurt her,\nand Ka-poel will need his help at the palace.

Sorcery enveloped them both and a blast\nrang in her ears, nearly knocking her off her feet.\n“Caught it in time,” Bo said, sweat beading on his forehead. “Keep\nmoving.”\nThe blasts continued. Each time magic came close to incinerating\nthem, she could feel Bo’s threads into the Else suddenly pull his own\nsorcery into the world as a counter. Marble flooring erupted behind them,\nspraying shards and dust into the air, knocking holes in the walls and\nceiling. Flame and wind buffeted the air around them, but it all bounced\nharmlessly off of Bo’s shields of air.\n“Wait, wait!” Nila said. “If we go this way, we’ll lead them straight to\nthe minister.”\n“Can’t be helped.” Bo hobbled on ahead, out the back of the office and\ninto the servants’ stairwell. Nila looked down the stairs and could still see\nthe fleeing minister’s staff. Back out in the hallway Brudanian soldiers had\ngained the landing and were taking up positions in doorways and behind\ncolumns.\nNila stepped away from Bo and leaned into the hallway, stretching out\none hand, plucking at the air with the other. Flames shot from her fingers,\nrolling and snaking through the doorway. A bullet splintered the door frame\nbeside her head, but she didn’t allow it to distract her. She focused on the\nheat of the flames, dragging sorcery through the Else and into this world.\nShe stiffened suddenly as an icy feeling crept up her spine, as if she\nhad suddenly found herself plunged into shadow on a sunny day. “Bo, what\njust happened to me?” Her fire trickled off, expunged by her sudden doubt,\nand she dared not move.\nBo hobbled up beside her, his prosthetic clicking. “Well done,” he said.\n“You’ve set the building on fire, but I’ll give you points for the effort. That\nthing you felt was me, by the way. Come on.” He grabbed her by the arm\nand they made for the back stairwell.\n“What did you do?” she asked as she helped him on the stairs.\n“Quiet,” he whispered. “Trick an old lover taught me. I took a tiny bit\nof your aura and left it where we were just standing. Leaves a splash of\ncolor in the Else that burns like a person and covers our tracks. They’ll see\nthrough it quickly, but it might give us time to get behind them.”\nThey passed the fourth floor and Nila rushed through the door and into\nthe office beyond, approaching the door to the main hallway. Soldiers stood\ndown the hall, gathered around the main staircase, muskets pointed\ncautiously upward. Among them was a female Privileged – Lourie, she had\nno doubt.\n“Now?” she asked.\n“No, down one more floor.”\n“We’ll give up the advantage of height.”\n“I’d rather give up the high ground if it means we’re not trapped.\nBesides, you set fire to the top floor.”\nThey returned to the stairwell and descended to the third floor.

    "text": "“I’d rather give up the high ground if it means we’re not trapped.\nBesides, you set fire to the top floor.”\nThey returned to the stairwell and descended to the third floor. Bo\napproached the servants’ door, sweat now pouring down his face, grimacing\nwith every step on his prosthetic. He’d lost his cane somewhere in the\nchaos. Nila ran ahead of him and grabbed the door, but was suddenly\nthrown backward by a burst of sorcery. She slammed into the wall, plaster\nfalling on her shoulders, the breath knocked out of her.\nA man strode through the remains of the door. He wore Privileged\ngloves and he was big, as big as Colonel Etan. Bo made a warding gesture,\nwhich the man seemed to brush away. He grabbed Bo by his wrists and\nswung him around and into the banister. It cracked beneath Bo’s weight and\nboth men toppled backward and plunged from sight.\nNila gathered herself off the floor and ran down the steps after them.\nThey lay on the next landing, Bo underneath the behemoth of a Privileged,\nwrists pinned at his sides. The big Privileged laughed and cracked his\nforehead against Bo’s nose. Bo screamed with pain.\nNila grabbed the man by the back of his neck. He whirled, spittle\nflying from his mouth as he threw her off of him. His eyes twitched toward\nher hands, checking for gloves, before he turned his attention back to Bo.\n“Shouldn’t be looking at me,” Bo said, blood bubbling from his\nnostrils.\nNila’s burning fingers seared through the man’s spine as easily as a\nshovel through snow. He gave a strangled scream before she was in his\nlungs, and he died with her hand around his heart. She shoved the body off\nof Bo.\n“Are you all right?”\n“I’ve felt better.” He wiped at the blood streaming from his nose. “Up,\nquick.”\nShe helped him to his feet, and then there was a great whining sound.\nThe building trembled, and blades of hot iron suddenly leapt through the\nwall above their heads, raining wood and plaster upon them.\n“Run, run!”\nTamas didn’t bother to find his horse, but rather threw another powder\ncharge into his mouth and ran all the way to Skyline Palace.\nTaniel ran beside him, rifle clutched in his hands, blood caked around\nhis nostrils and at the corner of his mouth. They reached the winding road\nthat snaked its way up the hill to Skyline. Tamas stopped them both there,\ngasping for breath. The powder trance spiked his adrenaline, giving him\nstrength and energy, but he was far too old to do this for long. He could hear\ncannons and muskets firing, and smoke rose from the hill above them.\nOlem must have started the attack.\n“Find the girl,” Tamas said. “I’ll look for Kresimir’s body.”\n“Do we have a plan?”\n“If we can get Ka-poel out and maybe Kresimir himself, we might\nhave leverage over Claremonte,” Tamas said. “I’ll distract him.”\n“That’s suicide.”\n“That’s why I’m doing it.”\nTaniel clutched at Tamas’s jacket. “I can survive his sorcery.” Tamas"

    "text": "“That’s suicide.”\n“That’s why I’m doing it.”\nTaniel clutched at Tamas’s jacket. “I can survive his sorcery.” Tamas\ncould hear the earnestness in his son’s voice, the insistent, almost pleading\ntone. He wanted to be the one to go in after Claremonte. Tamas would not\nallow that.\n“Cheris almost squashed you like a bug, Taniel. You won’t do any\nbetter against her other half. Get Ka-poel. Get her out of the building. If we\nhave her, we have leverage. Those are your orders.”\nTaniel let his hands fall from Tamas’s sleeve. There were several\nmoments when Tamas thought his son might argue. Taniel gritted his teeth,\nanger slowly turning to resolution. Finally, he nodded.\nThey continued up the road until they reached the extensive gardens in\nfront of Skyline Palace. It looked like a war zone. The cannons had stopped\nfiring, but the crack of rifles and the screams of men filled the air. Tamas\nheard a very un-powder-like detonation and could sense the sorcery\nemanating from the building.\n“Too small for a god,” he said. “Claremonte must still have some of\nhis Privileged here. Keep an eye out.”\n“I see her,” Taniel said, his eyes focused on something far away, half-\nlidded from looking into the Else. “She’s in the throne room.”\n“If Claremonte is still hiding his true power, he might be impossible to\nfind. I…” Tamas opened his own third eye and swept his gaze from one end\nof the palace to the other. Opposite the throne room, all the way at the other\nend of the palace, the Privileged wing where Tamas had slaughtered the\nroyal cabal shone like the sun in the Else. The power felt like it might burn\nhis face, and he knew that it could only be Brude. “Never mind. He’s not\nhiding.”\nA fact that couldn’t mean anything good.\nTamas searched until he spotted some of his soldiers crouching behind\none of the immense marble fountains in the garden. “Taniel, do you\nremember the trapdoor in the gardens behind the throne room? I showed it\nto you when you were a boy.”\n“Vaguely.”\n“It’s behind a statue of Manhouch the First – old man, big ears. Go in\nthat way. You’ll come out in a passage right behind the royal throne.”\n“All right.”\n“Get at it, soldier.”\nTaniel nodded and stepped away, only to stop and look back. Tamas\nmet his eye.\n“Dad?” Taniel said.\n“Yes, son?”\n“Be careful.”\n“You too.”\nTaniel was off at a crouching run as he ran from bush to bush, covering\nhis approach. Tamas went the opposite direction, toward the group of his\nsoldiers he’d spotted earlier. He came up behind them and threw himself\ndown behind the fountain where they hid. “Report!”\nOne of the soldiers, a woman of about forty with a major’s stripes on\nher uniform, snapped to attention. “Sir! We’ve encountered heavy\nresistance, sir. They’ve got marksmen in all the windows and at least three\nPrivileged inside. They had around a thousand men in the gardens, but we"

    "text": "resistance, sir. They’ve got marksmen in all the windows and at least three\nPrivileged inside. They had around a thousand men in the gardens, but we\nwere able to sweep through with our superior numbers.”\nTamas had expected Claremonte to have some kind of contingency for\nif he lost the election. After Adamat’s information that the ships hadn’t been\nfully loaded, Tamas had had his men follow them up the river to where they\ndisgorged the rest of their troops. Those troops had then circled back around\nto garrison Skyline Palace.\nBut Tamas wasn’t making the same mistake he’d made attacking\nCharlemund’s manor. He now had over twenty thousand men closing in on\nthe palace.\nWhether that would mean anything in the face of a god…\n“Casualties?” he asked.\n“No idea, sir, but it has to be at least fifteen hundred men. Those\nPrivileged were unleashed the moment we took the gardens.”\n“Where are they?”\n“North side of the palace grounds, where the fighting is heaviest.”\nTamas craned his neck to look out from behind his cover and toward\nthe north. At the north wing of the palace was the throne room. Taniel was\nwalking into a full-on battle. “Where’s Colonel Olem?”\n“We cracked the main palace door in two volleys from our cannon.\nFive minutes ago he led two companies into the palace to try to clear it out.\nHaven’t heard from him since, but the marksmen’s fire on this side of the\nbuilding has died down.”\n“Have your men tighten the perimeter. I’m going in after the colonel.”\n“We’ll send a company with you.”\n“Excellent.”\nJust a few minutes later Tamas approached the front doors of Skyline\nwith two hundred soldiers at his back. The mighty silver-plated doors had\nbeen rent asunder by light artillery. The entryway was littered with the\nbodies of the dead and dying, both Adran and Brudanian alike, and he left\nten of his men to move the wounded back out into the relative safety of the\nroyal gardens.\nHe paused in the mighty foyer and, by the pattern of the dead and\nwounded, could see the progress of the battle heading off to his left and up\nthe stairs around one corner. Olem had led his men toward the throne room\nto try to come out behind the Brudanian soldiers who were holding the\nnorthern palace doors. The sheer size of the palace could easily swallow up\nOlem and his two companies. The thought made Tamas wish he’d brought\nan entire brigade with him.\nHe felt tired, his strength waning. Every old, sorcery-healed scar\nached, and the memories of how he got them all seemed to flow together.\nHe remembered the campaigns in Gurla and the countless charges and\nbattles. He recalled his flight from Kez after his attempted assassination of\nIpille, and the years of planning his own monarch’s fall that ended in\nManhouch’s head in a basket. The battle against the royalists and his flight\nacross northern Kez toward Alvation all seemed to blend together.\nHe was so tired, and this needed to end.\n“You, Captain,” Tamas said, splitting his force in two, “bring your\nplatoon and come with me. Major, take the rest of the men up to the second"

Major, take the rest of the men up to the second\nstory and work your way north. There are a half-dozen galleries between\nhere and the throne room that will give you the high ground. Give Colonel\nOlem what reinforcement he might need from above.”\n“Sir?” the major asked. “Where are you going?”\n“I have a score to settle.”\nTaniel worked his way through the gardens and hedgerows, past the\nfountains and statues, over the decorative walls and around the north face of\nSkyline Palace.\nThe fighting grew thicker, bullets whizzing over his head, black\npowder smoke hanging like a fog over the ruined gardens. The smoke gave\nhim strength and clarity of mind as he avoided the clusters of Brudanian\ntroops and sprinted behind the lines of Adran soldiers slowly advancing on\nthe palace.\nHe moved like a man possessed as he rounded the northeast corner of\nthe palace, sprinting with all his strength. He cut across a polo lawn and\nheard the crack of muskets and the whiz of bullets cutting through the air\nbehind him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a squad of Brudanian\nsoldiers leave their cover in pursuit, but he left them behind as he cut\nthrough a hedge maze, throwing himself through the prickly walls of\ngreenery with an arm over his face.\nHe came out on the other side of the maze and descended a hill into a\ngrove of birch trees in a hollow behind the palace. The sound of fighting\nwas muffled and distant, and this part of the garden was overgrown but\nuntouched by the conflict. A dry streambed, once fed by the same pumps\nthat kept the fountains going, meandered through the grove.\nTaniel approached the back wall of the palace, passing the statue of the\nold King Manhouch the First. He ran his hands over the thick stone blocks\nof the foundation, ransacking his memory for an image of the entrance his\nfather had showed him sixteen years ago.\nHe continued along the wall for twenty paces, feeling every crack and\nnook to no avail, his heart beating harder with every second that passed\nwithout finding the entrance. Back at the statue he gazed for several\nmoments at the wall – all that lay between him and Ka-poel – before taking\na step back.\nThe fall might have broken his neck if he hadn’t dropped his rifle to\ncatch himself. His leg plunged into a hole in the grass below his feet, and he\nwiggled his foot in the empty space, unsure if his eyes were playing tricks\non him. Reaching down, he cleared away the grass to find an opening easily\nbig enough for a man worked into the landscaping in a way that made it\nimpossible to see.\nHe crawled in on all fours, sliding his rifle along ahead of him. Within\nten paces the passage turned and opened up into a narrow corridor. He was\nable to stand and keep moving forward. The ground was damp beneath his\nfeet, cobwebs tugging at his face and arms.\nThe corridor ended abruptly, leaving Taniel at a dead end. The only\nsounds he could hear were his own nervous breaths and the distant, almost\ninaudible cracks of musket and rifle fire."

    "text": "The corridor ended abruptly, leaving Taniel at a dead end. The only\nsounds he could hear were his own nervous breaths and the distant, almost\ninaudible cracks of musket and rifle fire.\nPutting his ear to the wall, he waited for several moments of silence\nbefore he pushed gently with both hands. There was a click and the wall\ngave way to reveal another dark hallway. He could see a source of light at\none end, which proved to be the hairline crack of what Taniel could only\nassume was another hidden doorway.\nThis door slid to one side in complete silence, leaving Taniel with a\nview of a well-lit, curtained-off corner of a room. He recognized that\ncorner. The tall windows, the blue-and-crimson trim, the tapestries gilded\nwith the dueling lions of the Manhouch family crest.\nHe was in the throne room, directly behind the throne itself.\nHe crept forward until he reached the curtain, moving it to one side\ncautiously with his finger. A sudden blast made him jump, withdrawing\nbehind the curtain and pointing his rifle ahead of him. A few shouts\nfollowed the blast, and musket shots echoed somewhere nearby. When he\nwas certain those blasts weren’t meant for him, Taniel leaned forward to\npeek past the curtain again.\nThe throne room appeared deserted. Dust covered the floor, though it\nwas crisscrossed with footprints, and a couple of the torches were lit. The\nbig double doors at the far end of the room were open about a foot. While\nTaniel watched, two Brudanian soldiers rushed inside and threw their backs\nto the door. They wore the uniform but neither held a weapon. Taniel could\nsense sorcery, and his suspicion that they were Privileged was confirmed\nwhen one held up his rune-covered glove.\nHe said something to his companion, then leaned into the crack of the\ndoor, and a blast of ice slipped from his fingers and disappeared. The other\nPrivileged’s fingers danced in the air, and Taniel heard another concussion\nbeyond the doors.\nTaniel wasted no time. He wrapped a bullet in cotton and rammed it\ndown the barrel to join the one already loaded, then stuck a spare powder\ncartridge between his teeth. He got down on one knee and with an elbow\npropped on the opposite knee he slid the barrel of his rifle through the\ncurtain. He opened his third eye to see the Privileged clearly, then pulled the\ntrigger.\nIn one instant he burned the powder charge between his teeth, sending\nthe energy behind the foremost bullet. The lead balls flew out of the\nchamber, one after the other. He let the first fly true and put his focus\nbehind the second, nudging it with his sorcery, adjusting his aim by just a\nfew feet.\nThe two Privileged dropped together, their brains scattered across the\ninside of the throne room door. Taniel swept the curtain aside and ran\nforward. He had to find Ka-poel and get her out of here. He could sense her\nnearby, he —\n“Ahem.”\nThe sound made Taniel spin.\nKa-poel sat on the throne, her legs dangling above the dais, hands on\nthe armrests, leaning back like she owned the chair. She was wearing new\npants and a shirt beneath a brand-new duster, and appeared unharmed,"

She was wearing new\npants and a shirt beneath a brand-new duster, and appeared unharmed,\nthough she was flanked by a pair of Brudanian soldiers. One of them held\nan air rifle, leveled at Taniel, while the second held a pistol pointed at Ka-\npoel.\n“Lower your rifle, powder mage,” the soldier with the pistol said.\n“Ka-poel, are you all right?”\n“Lower it!”\nKa-poel seemed unbothered by the pistol barrel pressed against her\nneck. She gave Taniel a thumbs-up.\nSlowly, his eyes on the two soldiers, he lowered his rifle to the ground.\nReaching out with his senses, he found no trace of powder on the two men.\nThe pistol looked off, and though he’d never before seen its like, he guessed\nit operated on air cartridges as well.\n“Pistols,” the soldier said, while his partner took two steps down the\ndais, his aim unfaltering. “Take them slowly from your belt and throw them\nover there.”\n“Just wait a minute,” Taniel said. Both soldiers were big men, as big as\ngrenadiers, with weathered faces and the lean, muscular build of\nprofessional killers.\n“Do it now!” the soldier shouted. He grabbed Ka-poel by the arm\nroughly and jerked her from her seat on the throne. “You even twitch and I\nwill —” His sentence cut out in a cry of pain.\nEverything happened at once. Ka-poel slipped the soldier’s knife from\nhis belt while he talked and rammed it into his groin. Taniel drew his pistol\nwhile the soldier with an air rifle whirled toward his partner.\nTaniel’s shot was rushed and went wide, blasting a chunk of wood out\nof the throne. He tossed the pistol aside and drew his spare, and in the time\nit took him to do that, Ka-poel stepped forward and smacked the barrel of\nthe air rifle to one side and slid the knife across the second soldier’s throat.\nTaniel leapt onto the dais, kicking the air pistol away from the bleeding\nBrudanian. He snatched Ka-poel up in his arms and kissed her, breathing\nhard. “You’re unhurt?”\nShe rolled her eyes and wiggled out of his arms.\n“Pole, we’ve got to go. Tamas wants you out of here. We’re going to\ntry to negotiate with Claremonte.”\nShe shook her head vehemently.\n“What do you mean?”\nShe drew her finger across her throat.\n“Kill him?”\nA nod.\n“We can’t, Pole. He’s a god. He’s Brude.”\nAnother nod.\n“You know?”\nShe rolled her eyes again.\n“Look, Pole, I’ve got to get you out of here so I can go help Tamas.\nHe’s going to get himself killed.”\nKa-poel rounded the throne and reached beneath it, dragging an iron\nstrongbox out and onto the dais with a thud.

She took a large iron key and used it to open the lockbox. Inside, Taniel\nrecognized the container she’d made of branches to hold Kresimir’s doll.\nGingerly, she removed the casket and set it to one side.\n“Good,” Taniel said. “Bring that too and we’ll get out of here.” Taniel\nstaggered to one side as sorcery shimmered around him, shaking the entire\nbuilding. “Was that you?”\nNo, she mouthed, pointed at his rifle still lying in the middle of the\nthrone room.\nTaniel fetched it for her. “We have to hurry,” he said. “Something is\nhappening. That sorcery feels so…” He tried to work moisture into his dry\nthroat. “I’ve never felt anything like it. It’s emanating from the other end of\nthe palace. Where Tamas is.”\nKa-poel pulled the ring bayonet off the end of the rifle, then used the\nBrudanian’s knife to slice the tip of her finger. She let her blood drip all\nover the slender blade. The color drained from her face and Taniel had to\nleap forward to keep her from collapsing. “What are you doing?”\nShe pushed him away and took a deep breath, steeling herself.\nStepping over to the Brudanian soldier, she looked down upon him like a\npriest might look upon a sacrificial victim, then plunged the bayonet into\nhis heart. The man twitched once and fell still, and Taniel watched as his\nskin seemed to wrinkle and sag, aging fifty years in a heartbeat.\nTaniel couldn’t help but feel ill. There was a part of him that knew\nhe’d just witnessed sorcery as dark as anything the royal cabals did in\nsecret. “Pole?” he said, reaching toward her.\nShe drew the bayonet from the soldier’s chest and handed it to Taniel.\nIt had not a drop of blood on it, but a thin red line ran from the very tip to\nthe ring. He recognized that red line.\n“This is what you did for the redstripes, isn’t it? And to contain\nKresimir?”\nA nod.\n“Did you kill people for those, too?”\nKa-poel shook her head, then mimed a pair of tall ears.\n“Rabbits?”\nShe shrugged her shoulders and made a wheel-like motion with one\nhand. Taniel got the message: and other small animals.\n“This will kill a god?” he asked.\nShe raised her eyebrows as if to say, I hope so.\n“That’s very reassuring, Pole. I don’t suppose you’ll get the pit out of\nhere on your own so I can go help Tamas?”\nShe shook her head.\n“All right. Stay close.”\nNila put a shoulder beneath Bo’s arm and they ran down the next two\nflights of stairs, spikes of hot iron as big around as Nila’s wrist raining\naround them.\n“How the pit can she do that?” Nila demanded.\n“Her primary element is earth. Every Privileged likes to get good at\nsomething that’s both effective and physically terrifying. Mine is ice. Those\nbloody bolts are hers.”"

Those\nbloody bolts are hers.”\nThey reached the bottom of the stairs. She headed for the door leading\noutside, but Bo stopped her with one hand.\n“There are worse things going on out there,” he said.\n“What could possibly be worse than raining iron?”\n“It’s not strictly iron. It’s compressed matter. Iron is just easier to say.\nAnd outside you’ll find a pair of gods fighting.”\n“You’re joking.”\nSomething suddenly shook the building, followed by a deep groaning\nsound. “That would be them.” Bo grimaced. “Pit, be glad you’re not attuned\nto the Else like I am. I feel like I’m walking naked through a battlefield. I\nwish Adom would just kill her already.”\n“Well, I think I would have preferred to remain ignorant of what’s\ngoing on.”\nBo limped on ahead, leading her through a series of servants’ rooms\nand out into the main hall of the first floor. “Keep close,” he said. “I’m\nlosing strength. I can only do so much.” His fingers twitched and Nila\nducked involuntarily as the ceiling above her exploded. The iron spike that\nplunged down through the ceiling would have impaled her from head to\nfoot if Bo’s sorcery hadn’t slapped it aside, sending it clattering down the\nhall.\n“What can I do?” she demanded. “I can’t form shields, I’m not that\nquick!”\n“You’ll learn.”\n“If I survive this!”\n“Good point. Air, can you do air?”\n“Only a little.”\n“Air behind your fire. The hottest fire you can make. The fire will melt\nthe iron, air will spread the molten metal around you.”\n“And shower anyone nearby? That’s mad!”\n“This is sorcery!” He stopped her with an arm across her chest. “Shit.”\nThe building shook and they both nearly fell. “One of those bloody\nPrivileged is trying to help Brude. I don’t know if it’ll do anything, but to\npit with me if I let him.” He reached out one hand. Nila noted his fingers\nmoving slower, his eyelids drooping. “Damn it, I’m getting tired. This\ndamned leg!”\n“Tell me what to do.”\n“Privileged. There.” He pointed up and to his right. “Two stories up.\nDo you feel him?”\nNila reached out with her senses. She could feel that Privileged and\nshe could sense something greater outside the building. It was thick and\nominous, far stronger than the Gurlish magebreaker’s sorcery nullification.\nThis turned her bowels to jelly.\n“Okay,” she said, her voice shaking.\n“Kill him.”\n“How?”\n“Be creative.”\nNila scowled. Reaching up, she flung her sorcery at the ceiling, her\nown fire splashing back to singe her clothes before melting through marble,\nwood, and plaster and boring a black hole right through the guts of the\nbuilding.\nShe felt the Privileged wink out of existence, his light in the Else\nsnuffed out. “I did it.

He would\nhave countered you if he had been paying any attention. Keep going, there\nare still two more of them. Lourie’s still on the fifth floor, but she won’t\nstay up there long.”\nThe iron spike came from nowhere, slamming through Bo’s shoulder\nand flinging him across the hall. His response was almost immediate, his\nfingers twitching even as he was thrown, spikes of ice flying through the air\nand impaling the Privileged who had appeared in the stairwell ahead of\nthem.\nBo tried to wrench the spike from his shoulder, screaming as it seared\nhis flesh. His wrists were suddenly pinned to the wall by air, and then a\nsmaller spike went straight through the palm of his right hand.\nNila stared in horror as Lourie strode into the hallway, ignoring her\ncomrade pinioned to the wall with ice like some kind of insect. Nila\nsneered, raising her hands, but was instantly batted down by an invisible\nfist.\nHer head pounded as she struggled to regain her feet, and watched\nhelplessly as Lourie approached Bo. The Brudanian Privileged stopped in\nfront of him, then turned to regard Nila for a moment. “What are you, his\napprentice? You should have carried extra gloves, little girl. A fight like this\nwill burn them off.” She turned to Bo and put a finger under his chin. “I’ll\nmake the offer one last time. But if you want to survive this moment, you’ll\nbeg me to kill this imp you call an apprentice and you’ll laugh as she\nscreams.”\nBo choked a couple of times.\n“Well?” Lourie demanded.\n“Nila,” Bo croaked. “Remember the magebreaker?”\n“You’re not answering me,” Lourie said. “You have five seconds.”\n“You have my answer, you bitch.”\nNila struggled to her feet and reached for the Else.\n“And what is that answer?” Lourie said, tilting her head forward in a\nmocking manner.\n“Burn,” Bo replied.\nNila tapped into all of her fury, spurred on by memories of her fear and\nhelplessness at the hands of all who had abused her. She used that strength\nto wrench sorcery from the Else. It poured through her, more power than\nshe could possibly hold. Lourie turned toward the danger, molten matter\ncompressing into a spike above her shoulder and soaring toward Nila. But\nNila threw air behind her fire just as Bo had said, and the spike melted to\nher flames and was splashed away by the air. She heard herself scream as\nthe flames washed over Lourie and plowed on ahead, blasting through\ncolumns and walls.\nIt went on for several seconds before, with a thought, Nila\nextinguished it, her eyes on the ash that remained of the Brudanian\nPrivileged.\nBo clung to the wall, his mouth slightly open. “Air, huh?” he said.\n“I’m really glad you figured that out.

Now, would you come help me get\nthis out of my shoulder?”\nCHAPTER 51\nT\namas and his squad of soldiers went through the Diamond Hall, passing\nthe shattered windows still unrepaired from the night of Tamas’s coup\nearlier in the year.\nThey moved through half a dozen large galleries, passing staircases\nand countless side rooms, but they met no resistance along the way. There\nwas evidence of animals taking up residence in this wing of the palace –\nchewed curtains, birds’ nests, and scratched plaster walls. Tamas had heard\nthat Claremonte’s headquarters had been in the royal apartments on the\nnorth side of the palace, near the throne room. Apparently this wing had\ngone untouched by his staff.\nThe battle seemed far away now, the palace almost peaceful. Tamas\nthought that perhaps he’d made a mistake.\nOpening his third eye confirmed that he had not. Claremonte was still\nup ahead of him, beyond the two scepter-wielding statues that flanked the\nentrance to the Answering Room.\nTamas motioned for his soldiers to split into two groups and flank the\ndoorway. They rushed forward, rifles at the ready, and took up their\npositions. Tamas moved forward to open the doors.\nHe sensed a flare of sorcery behind him and only his preternatural\nspeed allowed him to dodge the ice spike that flew down the hallway and\nslammed into the door where he had been standing a moment before. Tamas\nwhirled, pistol ready, and grunted as a second spike slammed into his\nshoulder, throwing him against the wall with enough force to make him see\nstars.\nThere were a few moans and a cut-off scream as his men died, nailed\nto the walls where they stood with sorcery-formed spikes jutting from heads\nand hearts.\nTamas fought against the pain, feeling the cold deep in his muscles as\nhe snapped the spike off the wall and pulled the broken piece slowly from\nhis shoulder. He jammed his fist into the wound and searched for the source\nof the sorcery, waiting for a second attack. There, coming down one of the\nstaircases they’d passed a hundred paces back down the hall. It was a\nslender woman in her fifties with graying brown hair trimmed above her\nears.\n“Field Marshal Tamas,” she said with a heavy Brudanian accent. “My\nlord Brude said you would —”\nTamas’s pistol jerked in his hand, and the bullet took her between the\neyes. He breathed shallowly for several moments, inhaling the powder\nsmoke, waiting to see if her fallen body would stir. It did not.\nHe removed the handkerchief from his pocket and shoved it into his\nwound. It was bleeding too much, the wound too wide. He could barely\nmove that arm, and he was sure that the ice had chipped a bone. Slowly he\nstraightened, feeling his strength wane, and let his eyes wander over the\nbodies of his men. Not a single one still drew breath.\nThe door to the Answering Hall swung ponderously at his touch, and\nTamas stepped inside the cavernous room, still lit by Privileged sorcery\nlong after the deaths of the men who weaved the spells.\nA raised altar draped in velvet dominated the center of the room, upon"

Lord Claremonte knelt before the\naltar, his back to Tamas. He was dressed in a fine suit with tails, his hat and\ncane on the ground beside him.\n“Good afternoon, Field Marshal,” Claremonte said. “I’m sorry about\nall this.”\n“No you’re not.”\n“A little. Come in. Would you like to know how to kill a god?”\nTaniel and Ka-poel rushed through winding corridors, back rooms, secret\npassages, and servants’ halls.\nHe could sense the power up ahead of them and he charged forward,\nwith Ka-poel leading their way through the maze of rooms. They passed\nthrough small apartments and dark hallways, cutting across marble floors\nlittered with Brudanian and Adran bodies and rooms that had been\ndestroyed by sorcery. He could hear the triumphant yells of the Adran\nsoldiers as they gained ground, but he soon left all sounds of battle behind\nhim.\nThey entered the cabal’s wing of the palace, marked by ancient runes\non the doorposts. This part of the building seemed deserted. They passed a\ndozen rooms, ascending to the third floor and then going back down to the\nsecond before Ka-poel finally slowed in a long hallway that ended in a\nlarge, well-lit room.\nTaniel could hear voices coming from the room ahead of them. They\ncrept to the end of the hallway and then across to a banister to find\nthemselves looking down into the Answering Room.\nKresimir lay on an altar in the middle of the room and Tamas, holding\none blood-soaked shoulder, stood in the doorway. Between him and the\naltar was Lord Claremonte, and he was speaking in the low, pleasant tone of\na man discussing the weather over tea.\nTaniel tightened his grip on his bayonet.\nClaremonte stood and faced Tamas. He held something in his hand, and\nTamas squinted through his pain to make out a piece of sharp flint.\n“First of all,” Claremonte said, “we’re not really gods. No more than\nyou are. We’re just very, very old. We were the very first Privileged to walk\nthis planet, back when men had only just begun to live in mud huts.\nKresimir used to say we were the first humans, brought into existence by\nsome kind of mysterious maker, but I know that’s bullshit. I remember my\nparents.”\nClaremonte tossed the stone up in the air and caught it. “I remember\nwhen Kresimir killed them. He made them scream for hours. Afterward, he\nsaid that their deaths were necessary because they wouldn’t let me go with\nhim. That they wouldn’t let him teach me how to wield this great power\ninside of me. Once again, bullshit. He did it because he liked to see lesser\ncreatures suffer.”\n“I thought you were brothers.” Tamas’s strength had fled him. He was\nweak with loss of blood, and he fumbled with a powder charge, lifting it to\nhis mouth, only to drop it."

    "text": "creatures suffer.”\n“I thought you were brothers.” Tamas’s strength had fled him. He was\nweak with loss of blood, and he fumbled with a powder charge, lifting it to\nhis mouth, only to drop it.\n“Brothers in sorcery alone,” Claremonte said. “My other half, the one\nyou call Cheris. She was my twin, conjoined at the hip. By all rights we\nshould have been exposed to the elements, left to die after birth. But our\nparents loved us and kept us. Kresimir killed our parents and then he\nseparated us with sorcery. We mourned for months. We clung to each other\nuntil he pulled us apart by force. Without him, we would have always been\none, as we were meant to be.”\nClaremonte looked behind him, frowning up at the second-floor\nbalcony.\n“What was I saying? Oh yes. Killing a god takes either raw sorcery,\nlike when Kresimir killed Adom’s mortal form a couple of months ago, or it\ntakes something like this.” He held up the sharp stone again. “This bit of\nflint is tens of thousands of years old. It was struck in a land far from here,\nlong since swallowed by the sea. Kresimir cut himself on it when he was a\nchild and that blood will be his undoing.”\n“That’s no sorcery I’ve ever heard of.” Tamas’s vision grew hazy. He\ntried to press his hand harder to the wound in his shoulder. It must be far\nworse than he thought.\n“The blood loss is getting to you, Tamas. Of course you’ve heard of\nthis kind of sorcery. It’s magic long lost to this part of the world, older than\nme or Kresimir, and never really understood by any of us. But it exists, and\nis still used today in a land halfway across the world.”\n“Dynize.”\n“Yes. All the way on the other side of Fatrasta. Your son’s little savage\ngirl is the strongest practitioner of this sorcery that I’ve ever stumbled\nacross, and that includes even myself. I’ve used artifacts like this to kill all\nbut two of my siblings.”\n“Adom…”\n“And Kresimir. Yes. I like Adom. He was always kind to me, back\nbefore I came into power. I’ve left him unmolested so far. I’m afraid my\ntwin won’t feel so magnanimous, though, with Kresimir out of the way.\nSpeaking of which.”\nClaremonte paused, and there was a distinct popping sound. Coughing,\nsmoke rising from her skin and hair, Cheris appeared from beyond a\ntranslucent veil of sorcery and stumbled into Claremonte, who caught her\nwith one hand. “Hello, my love,” he said. “What is the matter?”\nCheris hacked, then went behind Kresimir’s altar and heaved noisily.\n“Our damned brother has gotten his filthy sorcery inside me. I had to flee,\nbut I don’t think he’ll follow.”\n“I told you not to eat anything in this city,” Claremonte said, his\npleasant voice sounding slightly cross. “It won’t kill you. Adom is too\ngentle for that.”\nTamas took a step forward. The world seemed to tilt in his vision, the"

The world seemed to tilt in his vision, the\nfloor spinning. “This doesn’t have to go any further,” he said.\nCheris pointed at Tamas. “Why haven’t you killed him yet?”\nClaremonte rolled his eyes. “I had other plans,” he said, addressing\nTamas. “In case I lost the election. Plans within plans within plans.\nWeakening Ricard’s position, toppling the Adran currency. I planned on\nhaving power within twelve years, but my other half is less patient than I, it\nseems.”\n“You’re the one who left me in that bloody tower,” Cheris said to her\nbrother accusingly.\nTamas took another step. “Kill Kresimir. Go ahead. I won’t stop you. It\nsounds like he deserves to die. But leave us out of your machinations.\nLeave Adro in peace.”\n“You won’t try to stop us?” Cheris scoffed.\n“Now, now,” Claremonte said. “Don’t dismiss the field marshal\nentirely, Cheris. Tamas, I plan on uniting this world for a new era. I’d like\nyou to lead it. Say yes and you will be healed. I’ll lengthen your life. I’ll\nspare your friends and your family. You will hold a place of honor. You will\nbring peace to every nation on this planet.”\nIt was growing harder for Tamas to breathe now. He could feel the\nblood in his lungs, and wondered if he’d been cut in more places than just\nhis shoulder. It took every last bit of strength to grasp the spare pistol in his\nbelt and draw it. His hand wavering, he lifted it and aimed it at Claremonte.\n“No.”\nThe pistol evaporated in a splash of light, and along with it Tamas’s\nhand. There was no pain from the destroyed limb, just a sudden numbness.\nTamas stumbled backward, felt the sorcery grip and tear his body. The pain\nfilled his head until he thought it might burst, and then he fell.\nThe appearance of Brude’s other half gave Taniel pause. He waited for\nseveral moments, watching them speak.\n“Pole?” he hissed. “There’s two of them. Even if I can get close\nenough, I only have one bayonet.”\nKa-poel seemed to consider this a moment. She gave him a nod and\ntapped her chest with one finger.\n“You?”\nAnother nod.\n“What can you do?”\nShe smiled at him, but didn’t have time to give an answer. Out of the\ncorner of Taniel’s eye he saw a quick movement as Tamas drew his pistol.\nThe pistol exploded in Tamas’s hand, and Taniel could feel the sorcery\nspear through his father’s body.\nTaniel leapt the balcony and landed in the hall on the opposite side of\nthe altar from Brude. He saw Tamas’s body topple. “Dad!” The word\nwrenched from him as a sob, a searing, painful cry of fear and anguish. He\nstepped forward and felt Brude’s sorcery turn on him, snaking around the\naltar like a python and snatching at his bones. The pressure was incredible."

The pressure was incredible.\nHe instantly felt as if he were wading waist-deep through mud, the same\ncrushing feeling that had held him at bay in Elections Square.\nHe held the ring bayonet in one hand, the blade between his fingers.\nHe plowed forward, using the bayonet to cut through the sorcery as if it\nwere the prow of a ship slicing through the sea. Cheris rounded the altar to\nmeet him while Claremonte, his face calm, stepped up to Kresimir and\nraised the flint dagger in his hand.\n“Pole, a little help!”\nKresimir’s casket – the small one that Ka-poel had been carrying –\nsoared through the air in an arc above Taniel’s head. The sticks and string\nburst apart, the bonds around Kresimir’s doll unraveling in the blink of an\neye. Sorcery suddenly erupted from Kresimir, blasting both Cheris and\nClaremonte across the room.\nKresimir rolled off the altar and Taniel froze in place, afraid of the\nmadness in Kresimir’s eye as the god’s gaze came to rest upon him. But\nthere was no madness there. In fact, there was nothing. Kresimir’s face was\nblank, expressionless. Ka-poel’s doll floated above his head, and Kresimir\njerked as the doll moved, mimicking its motions.\nTaniel rushed toward Claremonte, only to find himself driven to his\nknees. He tried to stand, but he felt as if the weight of the world were\npressing down on his shoulders. His eyes bulged and his heart thundered as\nhe shoved against the unrelenting, invisible force. Through the slits of his\neyelids he could see Claremonte and Cheris, both on their feet, jaws\nclenched, fighting back against Kresimir’s sorcery.\nTaniel realized that the pressure he now struggled against wasn’t\ndirected at him, but was rather the strength of the two gods suddenly\npushing against each other. He was only caught in the middle. His whole\nbody shook as Ka-poel’s magic fought to protect him. He could feel every\nsinew straining, bones ready to snap at any moment. Ka-poel worked her\nway down the stairs at one end of the room. Sweat poured off her face and\nher fingers danced like a puppeteer with her hands on the strings.\nClaremonte and Cheris moved toward each other with Kresimir\nbetween them. Kresimir himself seemed unaffected, but Taniel could see\nthe doll above him dripping wax, the pressure turning it into a formless\nblob.\nClaremonte raised his flint knife and brought it down on Kresimir’s\nneck. The god toppled before him, and Taniel suddenly lunged forward,\nfreed of the oppressive conflict of sorcery. He gained his balance and\ngrabbed Claremonte by the front of his jacket, thrusting Ka-poel’s bayonet\nthrough the soft part beneath his chin and through his brain.\nCheris’s scream made Taniel release Claremonte’s body and clutch at\nhis ears. She ran toward him, hands raised, and he braced himself for the\npower of her fury."

Taniel looked to find Tamas at her feet, Claremonte’s\nflint dagger in his remaining hand. Blood poured from Tamas’s ears, nose,\nand mouth, and black powder stained his chin. He thrust the dagger through\nher leg.\nShe yelled again, but more in anger than in pain. “You think that will\nkill me?” she demanded. She snatched Tamas by the collar of his jacket and\nlifted his broken body only to recoil as he spit blood in her eyes.\n“Let him go,” Taniel roared.\n“You have no power to command me,” Cheris said. “I will drink the\nblood from your father’s corpse. I will slaughter you and your savage and\nthen I will bring my love back. I have that power!”\n“Let him go, and you win.”\nCheris hesitated. “What do you mean?”\nTaniel drew the bayonet from Claremonte’s lifeless body and flipped it\naround in his hand. “Here,” he said. “You win.” He tossed the bayonet.\nCheris dropped Tamas and reached up, but the bayonet arced over her\nfingertips. She whirled, hand extended.\nKa-poel snatched the bayonet from the air and rammed it through\nCheris’s heart. The god gasped once and toppled to the ground. Ka-poel\nstraddled her body and drew the bayonet out, ramming it in again and again\nuntil Cheris had stopped moving.\nTaniel grabbed her arm. “She’s dead, Pole.”\nKa-poel sneered at Cheris, but let Taniel pull her away. He left her to\ncheck Claremonte’s and Kresimir’s bodies while he went to Tamas.\nHis father lay on his side, soaked in blood. Both legs were broken, his\nleft arm shattered and left hand gone entirely.

Stay with me.”\n“Is it over?”\n“Yes. They’re dead.”\n“Bloody gods.”\n“Stay with me, please,” Taniel sobbed.\n“No, Tan,” Tamas said, blood on his teeth. “I don’t think I will.”\nTaniel’s vision blurred. “Please, Dad.”\nTamas groped blindly for the front of Taniel’s jacket, his fingers\ngripping the bloodstained lapel. “I’m proud of you, Taniel.”\n“Nothing to be proud of, Dad. I’m a terrible commander. An awful\nsoldier.”\n“You’re a good man. A good fighter. That’s all that matters.”\n“Just stay alive, Dad. You hear me? Stay alive.”\n“I’ve earned this, my boy.

Brude’s going to have a death\nrattle, and it won’t be pleasant.”\n“You’re coming with me.”\nTamas’s breathing slowed. His fingers loosened and his arm went\nslack. Taniel ignored another insistent rumble, ignored Ka-poel tugging at\nhis sleeve. “Dad…”\n“Hey,” Tamas whispered. His lips curled into a faint smile, and he\nsoftly said, “Your mother says hi, my boy. We love you.”\nCHAPTER 52\nA\ndamat reined in his horse in the palace gardens, not far from the twisted\nremains of Skyline Palace’s front doors. He dismounted beside a squad of\nAdran soldiers tending to their wounded.\n“Where’s the field marshal?” he asked.\nA captain got to his feet. “He led a company of men inside the palace\nnot fifteen minutes ago. What do you —?” He was cut off by a low\nrumbling sound. The soldiers exchanged nervous glances.\nAdamat replied, “I’m here with news from Adopest. The enemy has\nbeen driven off and the new First Minister is safe.”\n“Pit, I didn’t even know we were under attack in the city,” the captain\nsaid. “We’ve been hunkered down out here all night and morning. Tumblar\nwon the election?”\n“He did.”\n“Glad to hear it. I’ll send a squad in after Field Marshal Tamas to let\nhim know the news.”\nThere was another rumble and Adamat looked down at his feet. “Did\nyou feel that?”\n“Earthquake?” another soldier asked.\n“Someone find Colonel Olem,” the captain said. “And find out what\nthe pit that was. If there’s more sorcery about to spew out across the\nbattlefield, he’ll want to know about it.”\nAdamat eyed the palace gates and wondered if he should take the news\nin himself, but quickly dismissed the notion. Best to leave this to the\nprofessionals. Last time Adamat charged into a battle he’d gotten stabbed.\nTwice.\n“Get back!” a voice bellowed.\nAdamat turned to find a figure running up the road, approaching as fast\nas a powder mage in a full trance. He was tall and fat and soaked with\nsweat, his long black hair flying in loose, wet ribbons around his head.\n“What is it?” Adamat asked.\n“Get everyone back,” Adom shouted. “Now!”\n“Who the pit are you?” the captain demanded.\nAdom seemed to shimmer and grow, towering over the captain. “I am\nyour god, man, and if you don’t order a full retreat right now, every single\none of you will die.”\nThe order was passed on by a nearby sergeant before the captain could\neven choke out a reply. He sputtered once, then said, “Tell everyone to get\naway from the palace. Run!”\nAdamat went to Adom’s side. “What’s happening?”\n“You remember what happened to South Pike when Kresimir was"

Run!”\nAdamat went to Adom’s side. “What’s happening?”\n“You remember what happened to South Pike when Kresimir was\nshot?”\n“Yes.”\n“That.”\n“You’re bloody well joking.”\n“Do I look like I’m joking, Inspector?” Adom seemed to notice for the\nfirst time that his apron had come loose and reached back to retie it.\n“Faster!” he bellowed. “Get everyone away!”\nThough the palace gardens were thick with smoke and confusion, the\norder seemed to work its way through the Adran lines. Adamat saw a man\nride his horse into the palace, straight through the big doors. The ground\nshook again. A minute later the same man returned, followed by two\ncompanies of Adran soldiers hauling their own number of dead and\nwounded.\nMen leapt from palace windows as the tremors came in increasingly\nmore powerful waves, and Adamat had to brace his legs to keep from being\nthrown to the ground.\n“You may want to run, Inspector,” Adom said.\n“Will it help?”\nAdom seemed to consider this. “No.”\n“I’ll stay here, then.” Standing next to a god didn’t seem to be such a\nbad idea if the world was about to collapse.\nThe southern wing of Skyline Palace dropped out of sight so suddenly\nthat Adamat leapt back in fright. The section of the building dropped in on\nitself, and it took a moment for Adamat to realize that the ground itself was\nfalling away, swallowing the palace whole.\nThe walls caved inward and disappeared, and a plume of plaster dust\nshot upward from the growing destruction like the steam from an erupting\ngeyser. Adom braced himself, face shining with sweat and grime, legs\nspread for balance, arms at his sides with palms held open toward the\npalace, fingers gripping the air. Veins stood out up his arms and his muscles\nbulged, but whatever sorcery he brought to bear failed to slow the\ndestruction.\nCrimson leaked from the corners of Adom’s mouth and nose. A bloody\nsheen replaced his sweat, and his eyes looked like they might pop from his\nskull. The wreckage of the silver palace door toppled, swallowed into the\nwidening sinkhole.\nAdamat stepped back nervously. That sinkhole showed no sign of\nstopping, and though he could not see inside, he had the vague perception\nof depth that made him want to run. He glanced at Adom, whose whole\nbody now trembled like a twig about to snap, and though he was only a\nKnacked and hardly adept, he could feel the sorcery rolling off of the god.\nThe sinkhole swallowed more rooms of the palace and continued to\nwiden, reaching toward the throne room and the northern wing. Adamat\nclosed his eyes and stared at the blue sky above him, wishing that he was at\nhome with Faye and his children.\nThe rumbling stopped. The ground grew still. Scarcely daring to\nbreath, Adamat looked toward the earthen maw and found that it had\nstopped growing. The air was full of dust and soil, reducing his vision to\nonly fifty yards or so, but he could see the shadow of the northern wing of\nthe palace still standing.\nA marble fountain cracked and slid into the sinkhole and then the air"

Adamat felt as if the entire Adran army had breathed a sigh of\nrelief. Cautiously, the retreating soldiers came to a stop and began to trickle\nback toward the palace, looking on with horrified curiosity.\n“The field marshal!” someone shouted.\nAdamat found himself running forward with a dozen soldiers. The dust\nbegan to settle and clear as he threw himself to his knees beside the bloody\nbody lying on the gravel drive not far from where the palace door had\nrecently stood.\nField Marshal Tamas was missing a hand, and his clothes were black\nwith blood. The blood on his brow was smeared as if someone had held\nhim. His body lay alone, broken. Adamat pressed his hand to the field\nmarshal’s neck, feeling for a pulse. He felt his stomach fall as he relayed the\nnews. “He’s dead.”\nSomeone let out a choked sob. The quickly growing crowd split, and\nAdom plodded to the body, kneeling opposite Adamat. He scooped his arms\nbeneath Tamas, lifting the body the way a child might lift a doll.\n“Where’s Taniel Two-shot?” a soldier asked.\nAnother shouted, “Get Colonel Olem!”\nAdom cleared his throat and looked toward the gaping ruin. “Taniel\nTwo-shot is dead. There lies his grave. You may look, but you won’t find\nthe body.” He ignored the questions thrust at him by the gathered soldiers\nand pulled Tamas’s body tight to his chest.\nAnd there, among the ruined splendor of Skyline Palace, Adamat saw\na god weep for the hero of Adro.\nCHAPTER 53\nN\nila paced the marble floors of the People’s Court, her footsteps echoing\nin the early morning silence. It was less than a week since she and Bo had\nbested what remained of Claremonte’s cabal, and memories of the fight still\ngave her nightmares. She never wanted to set foot in this building again. Yet\nhere she was.\n“Why are they making us wait?” she asked.\nBo sat on one of the hard benches nearby bouncing a rubber ball off\nthe opposite wall of the hallway, pausing every other bounce to squeeze the\nball experimentally. He did not wear his gloves, and his right hand had a\npink scar from the healing job done by the Deliv Privileged. “Because,” he\nsighed, “they’re trying to show us who holds authority now.”\n“That’s arrogant.”\n“Welcome to the world of politics, my dear,” Bo said.\nNila stopped pacing and crossed her arms. She’d had very little sleep\nand she had a full day ahead, and she could feel her mood already\nbeginning to turn for the worse. “I’m not going to play their games.”\n“This is your life, now.”\nThe thought made her want to retch. For five days they had been\ninterrogated by politicians and pulled into late-night meetings with Vlora,\nRicard Tumblar, and a hundred men and women whose names she couldn’t\npossibly remember as they tried to force some kind of order onto the\ngovernment in the wake of Tamas’s death.\n“I should just leave,” she said."

I would be very\nsad.”\nShe resumed her pacing. “You’d get over it.”\n“I would never!”\nYou got over Taniel’s death awfully quick, she wanted to say. But she\ndared not utter it out loud. No sense in driving a wedge between them when\nthey so desperately needed to present a unified front to the world.\n“You must admit,” Bo said, “while less exciting than being shot at and\nchased, and battling sorcery, at least spending all day in meetings won’t\nmake you shit your pants. In there” – he pointed to the closed door down\nthe hall – “they won’t try to take your life. Just destroy your career.”\n“The joke is on them,” Nila said. “I don’t want this career.”\n“Then you’re the best woman for it. Come on, they’ve kept us waiting\nlong enough.” Bo got up, adjusting his prosthetic and pulling on his gloves.\nNila drew a pair of gloves out of her pocket and tugged them on. She\ndidn’t need them, but she’d found in the meetings over the last few days\nthat people took her far more seriously when she wore them.\nBo held the door for her, and she brushed past the secretary who tried\nto stop her as she went into the inner chamber.\nNine sets of eyes looked up as she and Bo entered the room. Nila only\nrecognized two of the men and three of the women, but she knew these\nwere the newly elected regional governors of Adro. They, the new Hall of\nMagistrates, and First Minister Ricard Tumblar made up the three legs of\nthe new Adran government.\nThe governors sat around a half-moon table, a light breakfast being\ncleared from before them. Governor Ratchel, a woman of about fifty with\nshort gray hair and hands curled and bent from rheumatism, scowled.\n“We’re not ready for you yet,” Ratchel said.\n“Yes,” Bo said with a charming smile, “but we’re burying Field\nMarshal Tamas in less than six hours in a ceremony in front of millions. We\ndon’t have time for your shit. If you want something from us, get on with\nit.”\nA round of indignant scoffs went up from the governors. Ratchel, to\nher credit, merely fixed Bo with an annoyed squint. “The time has come to\ndetermine the place of the Adran Cabal within our new government,” she\nsaid. “Or to determine if the cabal even has a place among us.”\n“Are you trying to tell me the Adran government would dare continue\nin this strife-laden modern era without a cabal?” Nila asked, feigning shock.\n“It sounds,” Bo said, looking equally surprised, “like they’re trying to\nput us out of a job!”\n“If you’ll just… ,” Ratchel said.\n“Well.” Nila threw her hands up. “I got my wish. Thank you for calling\nus in here to let us know. I think I’ll go spend the rest of the day in bed.”\n“I’ll join you!” Bo said with a wink, linking his arm with hers and\nturning them both toward the door."

Prosthetic clicking, he went and grabbed one of the\nchairs from beside the wall and dragged it noisily into the center of the\nroom, plopping himself down in it and leaning forward on his cane. Nila\ntook up a position behind him. “The cabal,” he said, “intends on serving as\nit always has. But instead of the king, we will serve the best interests of the\npeople.”\n“That’s very vague.”\n“I’m glad you noticed.”\n“It’s too vague. The cabal must report to someone.”\n“We do. We report to the army, who reports to the First Minister,\nwhose actions are answerable to both the Hall of Magistrates and the\nesteemed governors before me.”\n“There must be more direct oversight.”\n“And you,” Nila said, “propose that we report directly to the\ngovernors’ council?”\n“Yes,” Ratchel said curtly, fixing Nila with that same annoyed squint\nshe’d used on Bo earlier.\n“We’ve already gotten similar offers from both the First Minister and\nrepresentatives of the Hall of Magistrates.” Bo laughed. “And we’ve\ndecided that it is in the best interest of Adro for the cabal to remain\nindependent. We will fight the nation’s wars. We will fight for the people’s\ninterests. We will not be lapdogs to any single group of politicians.”\n“And who decided this?” Ratchel demanded. “The two of you?”\nNila said, “The two of us, as well as the recently promoted General\nVlora and the remaining half-dozen members of Tamas’s powder cabal.”\n“We’ve combined, you see,” Bo said. “So if you want to have this\nconversation again, you can do it with a handful of war heroes in the room\nin addition to the last two Privileged you have left.” He slapped his hands\non his thighs. “Well, out of time. Good day to you all.”\nNila helped Bo to his feet, taking satisfaction in the stunned silence\nthat followed as the two of them left the room.\nOutside the office, Nila watched men scrub at the blackened marble\nfarther down the hallway while Bo adjusted the straps on his prosthetic,\nwondering if it was her fire that had caused the stains or fire from one of the\nBrudanian Privileged. Frankly, she was shocked that the entire building\nhadn’t been condemned after that fight.\n“I thought that went rather well,” Bo said cheerfully.\nNila nodded. Part of her agreed. Bo was right.

The spirit of this new\ngovernment would be crippled from the beginning if any one branch of the\nlegislature had the cabal at their fingertips. Going it alone, however, meant\nthere was no one else to blame for their failures and shortcomings.\nSometimes taking orders was the easiest way.\n“Borbador!” a voice echoed down the long hall.\nNila turned around to find Inspector Adamat heading in their direction.\nThe inspector wore a new suit, and his eyes had dark rings beneath them\nfrom lack of sleep. He gave Nila a half bow, then turned to Bo.\n“Inspector,” Bo said. “How are you?”\n“Well, thank you. Tired. Busy. But well.”\n“Your family, how are they?”\nAdamat covered his grimace well. “Wonderful. Thank you for asking.”\n“And Jakob?” Nila asked.\n“Faye considers him one of her own.”\n“That item that we discussed… ?” Bo said.\nAdamat handed him a folded piece of paper. “You’ll find her here.”\n“Very good.”\nNila glanced curiously at Bo, but his face gave away nothing. “You’re\nmaking this poor man run errands still?” she asked.\n“Thank you for the consideration,” Adamat said, coughing into his\nhand, “but half a day’s work for fifty thousand krana seemed like an\nopportunity I couldn’t pass up.”\n“How do you feel about a more permanent position?” Bo asked.\n“I have one, thank you,” Adamat said. “I’m an ambassador now.”\n“Congratulations,” Nila said. “To where?”\n“We haven’t quite gotten that far, actually.”\n“You’ll get it sorted out, I’m sure,” Bo said. “I promise, though, that I\npay better than the government.”\n“Ricard is very generous with his friends.” Adamat paused, clearly\ncautious. “Just out of curiosity, what did you have in mind?”\n“Spymaster for the new Adran Cabal.”\nNila raised her eyebrows. Bo hadn’t mentioned this to her.\nAdamat shook his finger at Bo. “Not a chance. Far too dangerous. Far\ntoo political.”\n“I’ll leave the offer on the table for a week,” Bo said.\nAdamat bowed and took a step back. “I should be flattered by the\nconsideration, but I won’t do it. Thank you, Privileged.”\n“Shucks.” Bo removed an envelope from his pocket, no doubt stuffed\nwith krana notes, and handed it to Adamat. The inspector bowed again and\nmade his retreat, Nila and Bo watching him go.\n“That man is eminently employable,” Bo said. “I’ll get him\neventually.” He seemed to forget about the inspector, though, turning to\nNila and giving her a look up and down. “Time to get ready for the funeral.\nThen we have a trip to make tomorrow.”\n“Oh?” Nila asked.\nBo unfolded the paper Adamat had given him and looked it over.\n“South. Not too far.”\nThe Deliv army had made their camp in a small town halfway between\nAdopest and Budwiel.

    "text": "The Deliv army had made their camp in a small town halfway between\nAdopest and Budwiel. Only about fifteen thousand Deliv soldiers remained,\nthe rest having already begun their march to be home before the winter took\na turn for the worse.\nThe camp was semipermanent, meant to last through the winter, as\nmost of the occupants were the wounded and dying, and the surgeons,\nnurses, and support staff from both the Adran and Deliv armies, as well as\nseveral thousand Kez prisoners. The place reeked of blood, disease, and\ndeath, and the burial grounds on the plains outside the town seemed to grow\nby the acre every day.\nTaniel loathed it, and from the moment he and Ka-poel had ridden into\nthe camp he had wanted to be gone.\nBut he had a promise to keep.\nHe strolled through the camp, rifle over his shoulder, tricorne hat\npulled low over his face and the collar of his greatcoat flipped up. Just\nanother Adran soldier on leave, looking among the wounded for friends or\nrelations. No one stopped or questioned him.\nKa-poel clung to his arm, hidden in her own greatcoat. While he felt\nexhausted, his body spent from so long at war, she looked more vibrant than\never. Days of sleep had done her well, with her skin flushed and her eyes\nbright. The death around them didn’t seem to bother her, but Taniel knew\nthat, like him, she longed to be gone.\nTaniel spotted a familiar figure waiting beside a carriage near one of\nthe hospital tents at the center of camp and stopped to watch his oldest\nfriend for a few moments.\n“Did I ever thank Bo for saving my life up in the mountains?” Taniel\nasked.\nKa-poel nodded, then pointed at herself and shook her head.\n“I did too thank you for saving my life! Did you ever thank me for\nsaving yours?”\nShe cocked one eyebrow, and Taniel’s face flushed. “All right, so\nthanks all around,” he said.\nShe gave a perfunctory nod.\nTaniel took a step toward Bo, then hesitated when he saw that Nila was\nwith him. Taniel scowled.\nKa-poel tugged on his arm.\n“I asked Bo to come alone.”\nKa-poel seemed to reassess the situation, watching Nila for a few\nmoments, then tugging on his arm again. She mouthed the words, She’s fine.\nThey approached Bo and his apprentice, and Taniel tipped up his hat.\nBo just smiled and stepped forward to embrace first Ka-poel, then Taniel.\n“Tan. Little Sister. You look well rested.”\n“Being dead will do that,” Taniel answered.\nNila scowled viciously at Bo. “Why the pit didn’t you tell me he was\nstill alive?”\n“Does it matter?” Bo asked.\n“I’ve spent the last week thinking you were a heartless ass because you\ndidn’t seem to think twice over the fact your best friend had been killed by\na god.”\n“That was kind of suspicious, wasn’t it?” Bo said. “I’ll have to go into\nmourning when things quiet down.”\nNila rolled her eyes. “Pit, you’re insufferable. Taniel, why haven’t you\ncome forward? Everyone thinks you’re dead.”"

    "text": "mourning when things quiet down.”\nNila rolled her eyes. “Pit, you’re insufferable. Taniel, why haven’t you\ncome forward? Everyone thinks you’re dead.”\n“That’s kind of the idea,” Taniel said.\n“But why?”\n“Because,” Bo answered for him, “Taniel would have lived beneath\nTamas’s shadow the rest of his life. I don’t think either of us has any real\nconcept of what that entails. They would not have let him be Taniel. They\nwould have expected him to be Tamas all over again. Leading Adro. Being\nher beating heart every moment.”\nTaniel kept his silence. There were so many reasons to remain dead.\nHe wondered if he was a coward, taking the easy way out and leaving\neveryone else to clean up the mess.\n“That doesn’t explain why you kept it from me,” Nila said. “You think\nI can’t keep secrets? Pit, there’s no one for me to tell! You’re my only\nconfidant.”\nTaniel waved a hand between the two of them. “I asked him not to tell\nanyone,” he said. “Bo is a man of his word, but I’ll let the two of you work\nthat out later. Every moment I linger is a greater chance I’m recognized.\nDid you find her?”\n“I did,” Bo said. “Just inside.”\n“Good.” Taniel pulled the pistol from his belt and double-checked to\nsee if it was loaded while Bo tugged on his gloves.\n“You sure you need me?” Bo asked.\n“I’d feel better about this with you. Don’t have to come inside, just…\nbe here in case.”\n“She might have already sensed I’m here,” Bo said. “She and I don’t\nhave the best of relationships. Remember, I threw her off the mountain last\ntime we saw each other.”\n“I’m the one who threw her off the mountain,” Taniel said. He could\nalready feel his heart begin to pound and wondered if this was a mistake.\n“She won’t remember it that way.”\n“Who are you talking about?” Nila asked. “What are we doing here?”\n“Confronting a demigod,” Bo said.\nNila blanched. “Excuse me?”\nTaniel lifted the tent flap to the hospital. “Ladies first,” he said to Ka-\npoel. To Nila: “Don’t worry. She doesn’t have any hands. The two of you\ncan wait out here.”\nThe tent held three times as many beds as it did occupants, and Taniel\nwondered whether that was a good or a bad sign. Regardless, the lack of\nnurses fit their purposes, while none of the wounded seemed coherent. Well,\nalmost none of the wounded.\nJulene sat on a cot on the far side, the corner flap of the tent cracked so\nthat she could see outside. She didn’t turn as he and Ka-poel approached.\n“I see they cut you down,” Taniel said.\n“No thanks to you.” Julene’s voice seemed to have recovered from\nmonths staked out in the sun without water. Taniel circled her cot, craning\nhis head to look at her arms. They ended in bandaged stumps. A part of him\nhad wondered if they would grow back after long enough. After all, her\nsorcery made her stronger than just about anything short of a god."

Not to cut you down,” Taniel said. Nor\nwould he have promised to do the latter. She’d killed friends. She’d tried to\nkill him. She’d summoned Kresimir into this world, causing so much death\nand destruction.\nJulene shifted on her cot, lifting her right stub and jabbing it toward\nhim. “And you’ve come to fulfill your promise?”\nTaniel drew his pistol in answer.\n“I see.” Julene stared down at where her hands had once been, then\nglanced at Ka-poel. “You’re just something else, aren’t you? I can’t believe\nI didn’t see it. Have you loaded that thing with one of her bullets? The ones\nyou used to kill Privileged up on South Pike?”\n“I have,” Taniel said. He licked his lips. He wanted to lift the pistol\nand pull the trigger, but something was holding him back. Perhaps it was\nregret. Caution. Unwillingness to further the bloodshed. He was not certain.\n“Did they know what you are when they cut you down?” he asked.\nJulene shrugged. “The Deliv cabal has been glancing in on me, but I\njust told them I was a mercenary who’d offended Kresimir, and he kept me\nalive with his sorcery.”\n“And they believed you?”\n“Why wouldn’t they? It’s mostly truth. Besides, even if they knew I\nwas a Predeii, they’d know I’m not a threat without hands.”\n“You have a lot of knowledge, though.”\n“That’s why I’m not telling them,” Julene said, the scar on her face\ntugged by her shallow smile. “Best get on with it, shouldn’t we?”\nTaniel glanced at Ka-poel. Her face was placid. He lifted his pistol.\n“I don’t suppose you’d consider going back on your promise, would\nyou?” Julene asked mildly.\nSurprised, Taniel lowered his pistol. “You think I would? After all the\ngrief you’ve caused?”\n“It was worth asking.” Julene shrugged, as if she didn’t much care one\nway or another.\n“You want to live like this?”\nJulene turned her arms over. “I might be able to get it back. The Else,\nthat is. I can still see it, I just don’t have fingers to touch it. And even if I\ndidn’t, maybe I deserve this. Maybe I deserve spending the next thousand\nyears on the Deliv cabal’s torture racks, giving them every ounce of my\nknowledge.”\nTaniel examined the side of her face for several silent moments. He\nwondered if Julene was truly sorry for what she’d done, or if this was all an\nact. She regretted summoning Kresimir, that’s for certain. But the murder?\nThe chaos? Did she regret all that?\nTaniel stuffed his pistol back in his belt.\nJulene’s eyes flicked from him to Ka-poel, then back, widening\nslightly. “Don’t toy with me, Two-shot. Finish it or don’t, but for those\nmonths I spent hanging from Kresimir’s beam, for these hands of mine, you\nowe it to me not to toy.”"

I’m\nonly here because I promised to kill you when you wanted an end. Now that\nyou don’t want an end… I’m tired of the blood. Tired of the fighting.\nAnother gunshot won’t solve anything. But you have to promise me one\nthing.”\n“What?”\n“Let it all go. Any grudges you hold for Borbador or anyone else in\nAdro, they’re finished. Over. You’ve no business here.”\n“Agreed,” Julene said, almost too quickly. They watched each other\nfor some time before she raised her chin to Taniel. “I’ll remember it, Two-\nshot.”\nHe and Ka-poel left Julene in the tent and joined Bo and Nila outside.\n“I didn’t hear a gunshot,” Bo said.\n“I didn’t kill her.”\n“Is leaving her alive a good idea?” Bo asked, looking slightly nervous.\nHe had begun to peel off his gloves but now had stopped.\n“I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t think she’ll bother you any\nmore, though.”\n“You better believe I’m going to have her watched, regardless.”\n“Don’t blame you,” Taniel said.\n“Is that it, then?” Bo asked. “Are you leaving?”\nTaniel exchanged a glance with Ka-poel. It was almost time for that,\nyes. But not quite. “I’ve got one last thing to do,” he said.\nEPILOGUE\nV\nlora stood outside of her carriage, looking up at the three-story town\nhouse situated on a quiet street on Adopest’s east side.\nIt was late in the afternoon, almost four o’clock, and Vlora cocked her\nhead to listen for the church bell that had been rung every hour for the many\nyears that she’d lived in this home. It was several moments before she\nremembered that every church in Adopest had been destroyed, and the\nthought of never hearing that bell again brought her sadness.\n“Would you like me to come in?” Olem asked from the carriage.\n“Give me a few minutes,” she said, closing the carriage door. She\nwalked past the overgrown garden and up the front steps, slipping a brass\nkey from her pocket.\nLong practice made her stop in the foyer and listen for voices to call\nher name, but nothing answered her presence in the old home but the\nfamiliar creak of the floorboards beneath her feet. Dust filled her nostrils,\nand she wondered if anyone had been here since before the night of the\ncoup so many months ago. Her inquiries had told her the servants were\ndismissed last winter.\nShe was a general now, but felt no sense of accomplishment from it.\nThe newly minted House of Ministers had showered her with praise and\ngiven her the promotion with Tamas only a week in his grave. Now, six\nweeks later, it didn’t seem any less strange. The youngest general in Adran\nhistory, even younger than Tamas himself when he first achieved the rank.\nShe wondered if everyone else saw it as the political stunt that it was.\nUse them before they use you, she heard Tamas’s voice say in the back"

Show them you earned it.\nShe went up the stairs and sought the first room on the right – her\nroom for six years of her life, after Tamas had saved her from the street. She\nremembered a time from before the coup. Before Taniel was sent to Fatrasta\nand before that blasted nobleman.\nLaughter echoed in her memory and she tilted her head, wondering if\nshe had heard it for real. No. Of course not.\nThe bed seemed so much smaller than she remembered. How had she\nand Taniel fit in there on those nights when Tamas was gone? Had\nBorbador still been in the house? Or had that been after he was taken away\nby the cabal magus-seekers?\nThe memories seemed distant now, and she left the room and\ncontinued down the hall, pausing beside the door to Tamas’s office.\nHis desk was coated in dust, a map of Adopest still held down at the\ncorners by Tamas’s favorite teacup and a handful of musket balls. Vlora\ncrossed to the desk and rolled up the map carefully before returning it to its\nplace on Tamas’s bookshelf. She unbuttoned the gold epaulets on the\nshoulders of her uniform and set them on the desk where the map had been.\nShe felt tired. Dizzy. Weeks straight of shaking hands. Of parades and\nmemorials. Tamas’s funeral as well, which had been attended by two kings,\na queen, and what the newspapers had said were eight million mourners. It\nhad even been presided over by the newly pardoned Arch-Diocel\nCharlemund.\nShe opened the window of Tamas’s study and watched the dust swirl\nin the sunlight. Slowly, she went through the various knickknacks Tamas\nhad collected in Gurla. She ran a finger down the spines of his leather-\nbound books on warfare, religion, and economics. She remembered the\ncontents of this study like she remembered the palm of her own hand, and\ntried to recall the first time she had ever been in this room.\nThe memory seemed distant. Perhaps even manufactured in the back\nof her mind, pieced together from the scraps of a hundred other memories.\nIt was a faded thing, like cloth left in the sunlight for too many years.\nThere was a creak on the floorboards and Vlora opened her eyes, not\nremembering that she’d closed them. Her cheeks were streaked with tears,\nbut she did not wipe them away.\n“You don’t have to go,” she said to the figure in the doorway.\nTaniel wore faded buckskins and held an old, secondhand rifle in his\nhands. He had grown out his beard and his hair. His eyes were brighter than\nshe’d seen in years and he looked as if a weight had been lifted off his\nshoulders.\n“I do,” he said with a smile. “I’m free, Vlora.”\nShe stepped around Tamas’s desk and walked up to him, examining his\nface and eyes. She glanced back at the epaulets she’d left on the desk and\nshe thought she understood."

Tamas’s death has left a gap.”\n“One I can’t hope to fill.”\n“Just concentrate on the tasks at hand,” Taniel said.\nVlora responded, “Beon je Ipille has gone into hiding and there are\nrumblings of a Kez civil war. General Hilanska still needs to be brought to\njustice. Bo wants to combine Privileged and powder mages in the new\nrepublic cabal, and Gavril wants to make sweeping reforms to the\nMountainwatch. There is… a lot to do.”\nVlora had expected a more emotional response from Taniel at the\nmention of Hilanska, but he just nodded and reached over to touch the gold\nepaulets she’d left on the desk.\n“Tamas would be proud.”\nVlora looked down at her uniform, at the variety of accolades that she\nwanted every day to rip off the front. “You sure?”\n“I am. Will you sell the house?”\nVlora blinked at him. “What do you mean?”\n“I read about the will in the newspaper. With me dead, Tamas left\neverything to you and Bo,” Taniel said, touching the door frame with two\nfingers. “I’d sell it, personally. Too many memories.”\n“Pit, no. I’m moving into it.”\nTaniel seemed surprised, but after a few moments he smiled again.\n“That makes me glad, for some reason. We had a good time here, didn’t\nwe?”\n“We did.” They stood quietly for several moments before Vlora said,\n“Forgive me?”\n“Only if you forgive me.”\n“I already have.”\nThey hugged, and Vlora felt Taniel’s lips pressed to her forehead. She\nfelt dampness in her hair, and when they separated, Taniel wiped tears from\nhis eyes.\nVlora took his hand. “Good luck. Take care of yourself.”\n“You too.”\nHe left her in the quiet of her new home.\nShe remembered a night not long after Tamas had taken her in, when\nshe’d had nightmares. Tamas had come to her room and put her back in bed.\nHe had kissed her on the forehead, which no one had ever done for her\nbefore, and told her that nothing would ever harm her or Taniel while he\nlived.\nEven with the blood and slaughter and death, she hadn’t had a\nnightmare since.\n“Were you talking to someone?” Olem asked, entering the office.\nWho would keep the nightmares away now, she wondered, but even as\nshe did so, she could hear Tamas’s voice in her head. You will, he seemed to\nsay.\n“No one,” she answered Olem. “Just shadows of the past.”\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThank you so much to my editor, Devi Pillai, for the patience and foresight\nto help me get through my first series of books.
