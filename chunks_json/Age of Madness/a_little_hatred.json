A slit of stabbing, sickening brightness.\n“Come back.”\nShe pushed the spit-wet dowel out of her mouth with her tongue and\ncroaked the one word she could think of. “Fuck.”\n“There’s my girl!” Isern squatted beside her, necklace of runes and\nfinger bones dangling, grinning that twisted grin that showed the hole in her\nteeth and offering no help at all. “What did you see?”\nRikke heaved one hand up to grip her head. Felt like if she didn’t hold\nher skull together, it’d burst. Shapes still fizzed on the inside of her lids, like\nthe glowing smears when you’ve looked at the sun.\n“I saw folk falling from a high tower. Dozens of ’em.” She winced at the\nthought of them hitting the ground. “I saw folk hanged. Rows of ’em.” Her\ngut cramped at the memory of swinging bodies, dangling feet. “I saw… a\nbattle, maybe? Below a red hill.”\nIsern sniffed. “This is the North. Takes no magic to see a battle coming.\nWhat else?”\n“I saw Uffrith burning.” Rikke could almost smell the smoke still. She\npressed her hand to her left eye. Felt hot. Burning hot.\n“What else?”\n“I saw a wolf eat the sun. Then a lion ate the wolf. Then a lamb ate the\nlion. Then an owl ate the lamb.”\n“Must’ve been a real monster of an owl.”\n“Or a tiny little lamb, I guess? What does it mean?”\nIsern held a fingertip to her scarred lips, the way she did when she was\non the verge of deep pronouncements. “I’ve no frigging clue. Mayhap the\nturning of time’s wheel shall unlock the secrets of these visions.”\nRikke spat, but her mouth still tasted like despair. “So… wait and see.”\n“Eleven times out of twelve, that’s the best course.” Isern scratched at\nthe hollow above her collarbone and winked. “But if I said it that way, no\none would reckon me a deep thinker.”\n“Well, I can unveil two secrets right away.” Rikke groaned as she\npushed herself up onto one elbow. “My head hurts and I shat myself.”\n“That second one’s no secret, anyone with a nose is party to it.”"

By the dead, she felt sore and squeezed out.\nTwice the pain of a night at the ale cup and none of the sweet memories.\n“Doesn’t feel like much of a blessing to me,” she muttered, once she’d\nrisked a little burp and fought her guts to a draw.\n“There are few blessings without a curse hidden inside, nor curses\nwithout a whiff of blessing.” Isern carved a little piece of chagga from a\ndried-out chunk. “Like most things, it’s a matter of how you look at it.”\n“Very profound.”\n“As always.”\n“Maybe someone whose head hurt less would enjoy your wisdom\nmore.”\nIsern licked her fingertips, rolled the chagga into a pellet and offered it\nto Rikke. “I am a bottomless well of revelation but cannot force the\nignorant to drink. Now get your trousers off.” She barked out that savage\nlaugh of hers. “Words many a man has longed to hear me say.”\nRikke sat with her back to one of the snow-capped standing stones, eyes\nnarrowed as the sun flashed through the dripping branches, the fur cloak her\nfather gave her hugged around her shoulders and the raw wind wafting\naround her bare arse. She chewed chagga and chased the itches that danced\nall over her with black-edged fingernails, trying to calm her mangled nerves\nand shake off the memories of that tower, and those hanged, and of Uffrith\nburning.\n“Visions,” she muttered. “A curse for sure.”\nIsern squelched up the bank with Rikke’s dripping trousers. “Clean as\nnew snow! Your only stench now shall be of youth and disappointment.”\n“You’re one to talk of stenches, Isern-i-Phail.”\nIsern raised her sinewy, tattooed arm, sniffed at her pit and gave a\nsatisfied sigh. “I’ve a goodly, earthy, womanly savour of a kind much loved\nby the moon. If you’re rattled by an odour, you picked the wrong\ncompanion.”\nRikke spat chagga juice but messed it up and got most of it down her\nchin. “If you think I picked any part of this, you’re mad.”\n“They said the same thing about my da.”\n“He was mad as a sack of owls, you’re always saying so!”\n“Aye, well, one person’s mad is another’s remarkable. Need I observe\nyou’re a long leap from ordinary yourself? You kicked so hard this time you\nnearly kicked your boots off. Might have to rope you in future, make sure"

Might have to rope you in future, make sure\nyou don’t crack your nut and end up a drooler like my brother Brait. At least\nhe can keep his shit in, mind you.”\n“My thanks for that.”\n“No bother.” Isern made a little diamond from her fingers and squinted\nthrough it at the sun. “Past time we were on our way. High deeds are being\ndone today. Or maybe low ones.” And she dropped the trousers in Rikke’s\nlap. “Best dress yourself.”\n“What, wet? They’ll chafe.”\n“Chafe?” Isern snorted. “That’s the limit o’ your worries?”\n“My head still aches so bad I can feel it in my teeth.” Rikke wanted to\nshout but knew it’d hurt too much, so she had to whine it soft instead. “I\nneed no more small discomforts.”\n“Life is small discomforts, girl! They’re how you know you are alive.”\nAnd Isern hacked that laugh out again, slapped happily at Rikke’s shoulder\nand sent her stumbling sideways. “You can walk with your plump white\narse hanging out if that’s your pleasure, but you’ll be walking one way or\nthe other.”\n“A curse,” grumbled Rikke as she wriggled into her clammy trousers.\n“Definitely a curse.”\n“So… you really think I’ve got the Long Eye?”\nIsern strode on through the woods with that loping gait that, however\nfast Rikke walked, always left her an uncomfortable half-step behind. “You\nreally think I’d be pissing my efforts away on you otherwise?”\nRikke sighed. “Guess not. Just, in the songs, it’s a thing witches and\nmagi and deep-wise folk used to see into the fog of what comes. Not a thing\nthat makes idiots fall down and shit themselves.”\n“In case you never noticed, bards have a habit of dressing things up.\nThere is a fine living, d’you see, in songs about deep-wise witches, but in\nshitty idiots, less.”\nRikke sadly conceded the truth of that.\n“And proving you have the Long Eye is no simple matter. You cannot\nforce it open. You must coax it.” And Isern tickled Rikke under the chin and\nmade her jerk away. “Take it up to the sacred places where the old stones\nstand so the moon might shine full upon it. But it’ll see what it sees when it\nchooses, even so.”\n“Uffrith on fire, though?” Rikke was feeling a weight of worry now they\nwere down from the High Places and getting close to home. The dead knew\nshe hadn’t always been happy in Uffrith, but she’d no wish to see it in\nflames. “How’s that meant to happen?”\n“Carelessness with a cook-fire would do it.” Isern’s eyes slid sideways.\n“Though up here in the North, I’d say war’s a more likely cause of cities\naflame.”\n“War?”\n“It’s when a fight gets so big almost no one comes out of it well.”\n“I know what it bloody is.” Rikke had a spot of fear growing at the nape"

        "text": "aflame.”\n“War?”\n“It’s when a fight gets so big almost no one comes out of it well.”\n“I know what it bloody is.” Rikke had a spot of fear growing at the nape\nof her neck which she couldn’t shrug off however much she wriggled her\nshoulders. “But there’s been peace in the North all my lifetime.”\n“My da used to say times of peace are when the wise prepare for\nviolence.”\n“Your da was mad as a bootful of dung.”\n“And what does your da say? Few men so sane as the Dogman.”\nRikke wriggled her shoulders one more time, but nothing helped. “He\nsays hope for the best and prepare for the worst.”\n“Sound advice, say I.”\n“But he lived through some black times. Always fighting. Against\nBethod. Against Black Dow. Things were different then.”\nIsern snorted. “No, they weren’t. I was there when your father fought\nBethod, up in the High Places with the Bloody-Nine beside him.”\nRikke blinked at her. “You can’t have been ten years old.”\n“Old enough to kill a man.”\n“What?”\n“Used to carry my da’s hammer, ’cause the smallest should take the\nheaviest load, but that day he was fighting with the hammer so I had his\nspear. This very one.” Its butt tapped the rhythm of their walking on the\npath. “My da knocked a man down, and he was trying to get up, and I\nstabbed him right up the arse.”\n“With that spear?” Rikke had come to think of it as just a stick Isern\ncarried. A stick that happened to have a deerskin cover over one end. She\ndidn’t like thinking there was a blade under there. Especially not one that\nhad been up some poor bastard’s arse.\n“Well, it’s had a few new shafts since then, but—” Isern stopped dead,\ntattooed hand raised and eyes narrowed. All Rikke could hear was\nwhispering branches, the tap, tap of drips from the melting snow, the tweet,\ntweet of birds in the budding trees.\nRikke leaned towards her. “What’s the—”\n“Nock a shaft to your bow and keep ’em talking,” whispered Isern.\n“Who?”\n“Failing that, show ’em your teeth. You’re blessed with fine teeth.” And\nshe darted off the road and into the trees.\n“My teeth?” hissed Rikke, but Isern’s flitting shadow had already\nvanished in the brambles.\nThat was when she heard a man’s voice. “Sure this is the way?”\nShe’d had her bow over her shoulder hoping for a deer and now she\nshrugged it off, fumbled out an arrow and nearly dropped it, managed to get\nit nocked in spite of a flurry of nervy twitches up her arm.\n“We was told check the woods.” A deeper, harder, scarier voice. “Do\nthese look like woods?”\nShe had a sudden panic it might just be a squirrel arrow, checked it was\na proper broadhead.\n“Forest, I guess.”\nLaughter. “What’s the bloody difference?”\nAn old man came around the bend in the road. He’d a staff in his hand,"

        "text": "a proper broadhead.\n“Forest, I guess.”\nLaughter. “What’s the bloody difference?”\nAn old man came around the bend in the road. He’d a staff in his hand,\nand he lowered it, metal gleaming in the dappled light, and Rikke realised it\nwasn’t a staff but a spear, and she felt the worry spread out from that spot\non her neck to the roots of her hair.\nThere were three of them. The old one had a sorry look like none of this\nwas his idea. Next came a nervous lad with a shield and a short axe. Finally,\nthere was a big man with a heavy beard and a heavier frown. Rikke didn’t\nlike the look of him at all.\nHer father always said don’t point arrows at folk unless you mean to see\n’em dead, so she drew her bow halfway and pointed it at the road.\n“Best hold still,” she said.\nThe old one stared at her. “Girl, you have a ring through your nose.”\n“I am aware.” And Rikke stuck her tongue out and touched the tip to it.\n“It keeps me tethered.”\n“You might wander off?”\n“My thoughts might.”\n“Is it gold?” asked the lad.\n“Copper,” she lied, since gold is apt to turn unpleasant meetings into\ndeadly ones.\n“And the paint?”\n“The mark of the cross is a goodly mark much loved by the moon. The\nLong Eye is the left eye and the cross will keep its sight true through the\nfog of what comes.” She turned her head and spat chagga juice without\ntaking her eyes off them, then added, “Maybe,” since she wasn’t sure the\ncross had done a thing but get smeared on her pillow when she forgot to\nwipe it off of an evening.\nShe wasn’t the only doubter. “You mad?” growled the big man.\nRikke sighed. Far from the first time she’d fielded that question. “One\nperson’s mad is another’s remarkable.”\n“Be a fine thing if you were to put that bow down,” said the old one.\n“I like it where it is.” Though she definitely didn’t, it was getting all\nsticky in her hand, shoulder aching from the effort of holding it half-drawn\nand a twitch in her neck starting up that she worried might jerk the string\nloose.\nSeemed the lad trusted her to hold it even less than she did, peering at\nher over the rim of his shield. It was only then she noticed what was painted\non it.\n“You’ve a wolf on your shield,” she said.\n“Stour Nightfall’s mark,” growled the big man, with a hint of pride, and\nRikke saw he had a wolf on his shield, too, though his was scuffed almost\nback to the wood.\n“You’re Nightfall’s men?” The fear was spreading all the way into her\nguts now. “What you doing down here?”\n“Putting an end to the Dogman and his arse-lickers, and bringing Uffrith\nback into the North where it belongs.”\nRikke’s knuckles whitened around her bow, fear turning to anger.\n“You’re fucking not!”\n“Already happening.” The old man shrugged. “Only question for you is\nwhether you’ll be raised up with the winners or put in the mud with the\nlosers.”"

        "text": "“You’re fucking not!”\n“Already happening.” The old man shrugged. “Only question for you is\nwhether you’ll be raised up with the winners or put in the mud with the\nlosers.”\n“Nightfall’s the greatest warrior since the Bloody-Nine!” piped up the\nyoung one. “He’s going to take back Angland and drive the Union out o’ the\nNorth!”\n“The Union?” And Rikke looked down at the wolf’s head badly daubed\non his badly made shield. “A wolf ate the sun,” she whispered.\n“She is bloody mad.” The big one stepped forwards. “Now drop the—”\nAnd he made this long wheeze, and his shirt stuck out, a glint of metal\nshowing.\n“Oh,” he said, dropping to his knees.\nThe lad turned around.\nRikke’s arrow stuck into his back, just under his shoulder blade.\nHer turn to say, “Oh,” not sure whether she’d meant to let go the string\nor not.\nA flash of metal and the old man’s head jolted, the blade of Isern’s spear\ncatching him in the throat. He dropped his own spear, grabbed for her with\nclumsy fingers.\n“Shush.” Isern slapped his hand away and ripped the blade free in a\nblack gout. He wriggled on the ground, fiddling with the great wound in his\nneck as if he might stop it splurting. He was trying to say something, but\nfast as he could spit the blood out, his mouth filled up again. Then he\nstopped moving.\n“You killed ’em.” Rikke felt all hot. There were some red speckles on\nher hand. The big one was lying on his face, shirt soaked dark.\n“You killed this one,” said Isern. The lad knelt there, making these\nsqueaky little gasps as he tried to reach around his back to the arrow shaft,\nthough what he’d do if he got his fingertips to it, Rikke had no idea.\nProbably he’d no idea, either. Isern was the only one thinking clearly right\nthen. She leaned down and calmly plucked the knife from the lad’s belt.\n“Was hoping to set him a question or two, but he’ll be giving no answers\nwith that shaft in his lung.”\nAs if to prove the point, he coughed some blood into his hand, and\nstared over it at Rikke. He looked a bit offended, like she’d said something\nhurtful.\n“Still, no one ever gets things all their own way.” Rikke jumped at the\ncrack as Isern rammed the lad’s knife into the crown of his head. His eyes\nrolled up and his leg kicked and his back arched. Just like hers did, maybe,\nwhen a fit came upon her.\nThe hairs were standing on Rikke’s arms as he slumped down limp. She\nnever saw a man killed before. All happened so fast she didn’t know how\nshe ought to feel about it.\n“They didn’t seem so bad,” she said.\n“For a girl struggling to penetrate the mists of the future, you don’t half\nmiss what’s right in front of you.” Isern was already rooting through the old\nman’s pockets, point of her tongue wedged in the hole in her teeth. “If you"

        "text": "miss what’s right in front of you.” Isern was already rooting through the old\nman’s pockets, point of her tongue wedged in the hole in her teeth. “If you\nwait till they seem bad, you’ve waited way too long.”\n“Could’ve given ’em a chance.”\n“To what? Put you in the mud? Or drag you off to Stour Nightfall?\nChafing would’ve been the least of your worries then, that boy’s got a\nbastard of a reputation.” She caught the old man’s leg and dragged him\nfrom the path into the undergrowth, tossed his spear after. “Or were we\ngoing to invite ’em dancing through the woods with us, and all wear flowers\nin our hair and win ’em over to our side with my pretty words and your\npretty smile?”\nRikke spat some chagga juice and wiped her chin, watching the blood\nwork its way through the dirt about the lad’s nailed head. “Doubt my\nsmile’s up to the task and I’m damn sure your words ain’t.”\n“Then killing ’em was all o’ the one choices we had, eh? Your problem\nis you’re all heart.” And she stabbed Rikke in the tit with one bony finger.\n“Ow!” Rikke took a step away, holding her arms across her chest. “That\nhurts, you know!”\n“You’re all heart all over, so you feel every sting and buffet. You must\nmake of your heart a stone.” And Isern thumped her ribs with a fist, the\nfinger bones around her neck rattling. “Ruthlessness is a quality much loved\no’ the moon.” As if to prove the point, she bent down and heaved the dead\nlad into the bushes. “A leader must be hard, so others don’t have to be.”\n“Leader o’ what?” muttered Rikke, rubbing at her sore tit. And that was\nwhen she caught a whiff of smoke, just like in her dream. As if it was a\ntugging she couldn’t resist, she set off down the path.\n“Oy!” called Isern around a stick of dry meat she’d rooted out of the big\none’s pouch. “I need help dragging this big bastard!”\n“No,” whispered Rikke, the smell of fire getting stronger and her worry\ngetting stronger with it. “No, no, no.”\nShe burst from the trees and into cold daylight, took a couple more\nwobbling steps and stopped, bow dangling from her limp hand.\nThe morning mist was long faded and she could see all the way across\nthe patchwork of new-planted fields to Uffrith, wedged in against the grey\nsea behind its grey wall. Where her father’s old hall stood with the scraggy\ngarden out the back. Safe, boring Uffrith, where she’d been born and raised.\nOnly it was burning, just the way she’d seen it, and a great column of dark\nsmoke rolled up and smudged the sky, drifting out over the restless sea.\n“By the dead,” she croaked.\nIsern wandered from the trees with her spear across her shoulders and a\ngreat smile across her face. “You know what this means?”\n“War?” whispered Rikke, horrified.\n“Aye, that.” Isern waved it away like it was a trifle. “But more to the"

A glimpse of a gawping face\nbefore his axe split it open, blood spraying in black streaks.\nOther riders tore into the Northmen, tossing them like broken dolls. He\nsaw one horse spitted through the head with a spear. The rider turned a\nsomersault as he was flung from the saddle.\nA lance shattered, a shard flying into Leo’s helmet with an echoing clang\nas he wrenched away. The world was a flickering slit of twisted faces,\nglinting steel, heaving bodies, half seen through the slot in his visor.\nScreams of men and mounts and metal mashed into one thought-crushing\ndin.\nA horse swerved in front of him. Riderless, stirrups flapping. Ritter’s\nhorse. He could tell by the yellow saddlecloth. A spear stabbed at him,\njolting the shield on his arm, rocking him in his saddle. The point screeched\ndown his armoured thigh.\nHe gripped the reins in his shield-hand as his mount bucked and snorted,\nface locked in an aching smile, flailing wildly with his axe on one side, then\nthe other. He beat mindlessly at a shield with a black wolf painted on it,\nkicked at a man and sent him staggering back, then Barniva’s sword flashed\nas it took his arm off.\nHe saw Whitewater Jin swinging his mace, red hair tangled across\ngritted teeth. Just beyond him, Antaup was shrieking something as he tried\nto twist his spear free of bloody mail. Glaward wrestled with a Carl, both\nwithout weapons, all tangled with their reins. Leo hacked at the Northman\nand smashed his elbow back the wrong way, hacked again and sent him\nflopping into the mud.\nHe pointed at Stour Nightfall’s standard with his axe, black wolf\nstreaming in the wind. He howled, roared, throat hoarse. No one could hear\nhim with his visor down. No one could’ve heard him if it had been up. He\nhardly knew what he was saying. He flailed furiously at the milling bodies\ninstead.\nSomeone clutched at his leg. Curly hair. Freckles. Looked bloody\nterrified. Everyone did. Didn’t seem to have a weapon. Maybe surrendering.\nLeo smashed Freckles on the top of the head with the rim of his shield, gave\nhis horse the spurs and trampled him into the mud.\nThis was no place for good intentions.

None of his mother’s carping on patience and\ncaution. Everything was beautifully simple.\nIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is, and Leo was the hero he’d\nalways dreamed of being.\nHe swung again but his axe felt strange. The blade had flown off, left\nhim holding a bloody stick. He dropped it, dragged out his battle steel,\nbuzzing fingers clumsy in his gauntlet, hilt greasy from the thickening rain.\nHe realised the man he’d been hitting was dead. He’d fallen against the\nfence, so it looked as if he was standing but there was black pulp hanging\nout of his broken skull, so that was that.\nThe Northmen were crumbling. Running, squealing, being hacked down\nfrom behind, and Leo herded them towards their standard. Three riders had\na whole crowd of them hemmed into a gateway, Barniva in their midst,\nscarred face flecked with blood as he chopped away with his heavy sword.\nThe standard-bearer was a huge man with desperate eyes and blood in\nhis beard, still holding high the flag of the black wolf. Leo spurred right at\nhim, blocked axe with shield, caught him with a sword-cut that screeched\nover his cheek guard and opened a great gash across his face, carved half\nhis nose off. He tottered back and Whitewater Jin crushed the man’s helmet\nwith his mace, blood squirting from under the rim. Leo kicked him over,\ntearing the standard from his limp hand as he fell. He thrust it up, laughing,\ngurgling, half-choking on his own spit then laughing again, his axe’s loop\nstill stuck around his wrist so the broken haft clattered against his helmet.\nHad they won? He stared around for more enemies. A few ragged figures\nbounded through the crops towards the distant trees. Running for their lives,\nweapons abandoned. That was all.\nLeo ached all over: thighs from gripping his horse, shoulders from\nswinging his axe, hands from gripping the reins. The very soles of his feet\nthrobbed from the effort. His chest heaved, breath booming in his helmet,\ndamp, and hot, and tasting of salt. Might’ve bit his tongue somewhere. He\nfumbled with the buckle under his chin, finally tore the damn thing free. His\nskull burst with the noise, turned from fury to delight. The noise of victory.\nHe almost fell from his horse, clambered up onto the wall. Something\nwas soft under his gauntleted hand. A Northman’s corpse, a broken spear\nsticking from his back. All he felt was giddy joy.\nNo corpses, no glory, after all. Might as well regret the peelings from a\ncarrot. Someone was helping him up, giving him a steadying hand. Jurand.\nAlways there when he needed him. Leo stood tall, the joyful faces of his\nmen all turned towards him.\n“The Young Lion!” roared Glaward, climbing up beside him and\nclapping a heavy hand on his shoulder, making him wobble. Jurand\nstretched out his arms to catch him, but he didn’t fall. “Leo dan Brock!”\nSoon they were all shouting his name, singing it like a prayer, chanting it"

Leo! Leo!”\nIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is.\nHe felt drunk. He felt on fire. He felt like a king. He felt like a god. This\nwas what he was made for!\n“Victory!” he roared, shaking his bloody sword and the Northmen’s\nbloody standard.\nBy the dead, could there be anything better than this?\nIn the lady governor’s tent, they were fighting a different kind of war. A war\nof patient study and careful calculation, of weighed odds and furrowed\nbrows, of lines of supply and an awful lot of maps. A kind of war Leo\nfrankly hadn’t the patience for.\nThe glow of victory had been dampened by the stiffening rain on the\nlong trudge up from the valley, doused further by the niggling pain from a\ndozen cuts and bruises, and was almost entirely smothered by the cool stare\nhis mother gave him as Leo pushed through the flap with Jurand and\nWhitewater Jin at his back.\nShe was in the midst of talking to a knight herald. Ridiculously tall, he\nhad to stoop respectfully to attend to her.\n“… please tell His Majesty we are doing everything to check the\nNorthmen’s advance, but Uffrith is lost and we are giving ground. They\nstruck with overwhelming force at three points and we are still gathering\nour troops. Ask him… no, beg him to send reinforcements.”\n“I will, my Lady Governor.” The knight herald nodded to Leo as he\npassed. “My congratulations on your victory, Lord Brock.”\n“We don’t need the king’s bloody help!” snapped Leo as soon as the flap\ndropped. “We can beat Black Calder’s dogs!” His voice sounded oddly\nweak in the tent, deadened by wet cloth. It didn’t carry anywhere near so\nnicely as it had on the battlefield.\n“Huh.” His mother planted her fists on the table and frowned down at\nher maps. By the dead, sometimes he thought she loved those maps more\nthan him. “If we are to fight the king’s battles, we should expect the king’s\nhelp.”\n“You should’ve seen them run!” Damn it, but Leo had been so sure of\nhimself a few moments ago. He could charge a line of Carls and never\nfalter, but a woman with a long neck and greying hair leached all the\ncourage out of him. “They broke before we even got to them! We took a\nfew dozen prisoners…” He glanced towards Jurand, but he was giving Leo\nthat doubtful look now, the one he used when he didn’t approve, the one\nhe’d given him before the charge. “And the farm’s back in our hands…\nand…”\nHis mother let him stammer into silence before she glanced at his\nfriends. “My thanks, Jurand. I’m sure you did your best to talk him out of it.\nAnd you, Whitewater. My son couldn’t ask for better friends or I for braver\nwarriors.”\nJin slapped a heavy hand down on Leo’s shoulder. “It was Leo who led\nthe—”\n“You can go.”"

Jurand gave Leo the slightest apologetic\nwince. “Of course, Lady Finree.” And they slunk from the tent, leaving Leo\nto fiddle weakly with the fringe of his captured standard.\nHis mother let the withering silence stretch a moment longer before she\npassed judgement. “You bloody fool.”\nHe’d known it was coming, but it still stung. “Because I actually\nfought?”\n“Because of when you chose to fight, and how.”\n“Great leaders go where the fight’s hottest!” But he knew he sounded\nlike the heroes in the badly written storybooks he used to love.\n“You know who else you find where the fight’s hottest?” asked his\nmother. “Dead men. We both know you’re not a fool, Leo. For whose\nbenefit are you pretending to be one?” She shook her head wearily. “I\nshould never have let your father send you to live with the Dogman. All you\nlearned in Uffrith was rashness, bad songs and a childish admiration for\nmurderers. I should have sent you to Adua instead. I doubt your singing\nwould be any better but at least you might have learned some subtlety.”\n“There’s a time for subtlety and a time for action!”\n“There is never a time for recklessness, Leo. Or for vanity.”\n“We bloody won!”\n“Won what? A worthless farm in a worthless valley? That was little\nmore than a scouting party, and now the enemy will guess our strength.”\nShe gave a bitter snort as she turned back to her maps. “Or the lack of it.”\n“I captured a standard.” It seemed a pitiful thing now he really looked at\nit, though, clumsily stitched, the pole closer to a branch than a flagstaff.\nHow could he have thought Stour Nightfall himself might ride beneath it?\n“We have plenty of flags,” said his mother. “It’s men to follow them\nwe’re short of. Perhaps you could bring back a few regiments of those next\ntime?”\n“Damn it, Mother, I don’t know how to please you—”\n“Listen to what you’re told. Learn from those who know better. Be\nbrave, by all means, but don’t be rash. Above all, don’t get yourself bloody\nkilled! You’ve always known exactly how to please me, Leo, but you\nchoose to please yourself.”\n“You can’t understand! You’re not…” He waved an impatient hand,\nfailing, as always, to quite find the right words. “A man,” he finished\nlamely.\nShe raised one brow. “Had I been confused on that point, it was put\nbeyond doubt when I pushed you out of my womb. Have you any notion\nhow much you weighed as a baby? Spend two days shitting an anvil and\nwe’ll talk again.”\n“Bloody hell, Mother! I mean that men will look up to a certain kind of\nman, and—”\n“Like your friend Ritter looked up to you?”\nLeo was caught out by the memory of that riderless horse clattering past."

Realised he hadn’t even thought about that until now.\n“He knew the risks,” he croaked, suddenly choked with worry. “He\nchose to fight. He was proud to fight!”\n“He was. Because you have that fire in you that inspires men to follow.\nYour father had it, too. But with that gift comes responsibility. Men put\ntheir lives in your hands.”\nLeo swallowed, pride melting to leave ugly guilt behind as pristine snow\nmelts to show the world rotten and bedraggled. “I should go and see him.”\nHe turned towards the tent flap, nearly tripping on the loose strap of one of\nhis greaves. “Is he… with the wounded?”\nHis mother’s face had softened. That made him more worried than ever.\n“He’s with the dead, Leo.” There was a long, strange silence, and outside\nthe wind blew up and made the canvas of the tent flap and whisper. “I’m\nsorry.”\nNo corpses, no glory. He sank onto a folding field chair, captured\nstandard clattering to the ground.\n“He said we should wait for you,” he muttered, remembering Ritter’s\nworried face as he looked down into the valley. “So did Jurand. I told them\nthey could stay with the ladies… while we handled the fighting.”\n“You did what you thought was right,” murmured his mother. “In the\nheat of the moment.”\n“He has a wife…” Leo remembered the wedding. What the hell was her\nname? Bit of a weak chin. The groom had looked prettier. The happy couple\nhad danced, badly, and Whitewater Jin had bellowed in Northern that he\nhoped for her sake Ritter fucked better than he danced. Leo had laughed so\nhard he was nearly sick. He didn’t feel like laughing now. Being sick, yes.\n“By the dead… he has a child.”\n“I will write to them.”\n“What good will a letter do?” He felt the stinging of tears at the back of\nhis nose. “I’ll give them my house! In Ostenhorm!”\n“Are you sure?”\n“Why do I need a house? I spend all my time in the saddle.”\n“You’ve a big heart, Leo.” His mother squatted down before him. “Too\nbig, I sometimes think.” Her pale hands looked tiny in his gauntleted fists,\nbut they were the stronger then. “You have it in you to be a great man, but\nyou cannot let yourself be swept off by whatever emotion blows your way.\nBattles may sometimes be won by the brave, but wars are always won by\nthe clever. Do you understand?”\n“I understand,” he whispered.\n“Good. Give orders to leave the farm and pull back towards the west\nbefore Stour Nightfall arrives in force.”\n“But if we fall back… Ritter died for nothing. If we fall back, how will\nthat look?”\nShe stood. “Like womanly weakness and indecision, I hope. Then\nperhaps the rash heads on the Northmen’s side will prevail and pursue us\nwith manly smiles on their manly faces, and when the king’s soldiers finally"

I\nwon’t deny we all need something to cheer for. You gave Stour Nightfall a\nbloody nose, and great warriors are quick to anger, and angry men make\nmistakes.” She pressed something into his limp hand. The standard with\nNightfall’s wolf on it. “Your father would have been proud of your courage,\nLeo. Now make me proud of your judgement.”\nHe trudged to the tent flap, shoulders drooping under armour that felt\nthree times heavier than when he arrived. Ritter was gone, and never\ncoming back, and had left his weak-chinned wife weeping at the fireside.\nKilled by his own loyalty, and Leo’s vanity, and Leo’s carelessness, and\nLeo’s arrogance.\n“By the dead.” He tried to rub the tears away with the back of his hand\nbut couldn’t do it with his gauntlets on. He used the hem of the captured\nstandard instead.\nIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is.\nHe froze as he stepped into the daylight. What looked like a whole\nregiment had gathered in a crescent, looking up towards his mother’s tent.\n“A cheer for Leo dan Brock!” roared Glaward, catching Leo’s wrist in\nhis ham of a fist and hoisting it high. “The Young Lion!”\n“The Young Lion!” bellowed Barniva as a rousing cheer went up. “Leo\ndan Brock!”\n“I tried to warn you.” Jurand leaned over to mutter in his ear. “She give\nyou a roasting?”\n“Nothing I didn’t deserve.” But Leo managed to smile a little, too. Just\nfor the sake of morale. No one could deny they all needed something to\ncheer for.\nIt grew louder as he raised that rag of a standard, and Antaup swaggered\nforwards, throwing up his arms for more noise. One of the men, no doubt\ndrunk already, dragged down his trousers and showed his bare arse to the\nNorth, to widespread approval. Then he fell over, to widespread laughter.\nGlaward and Barniva caught Leo and bundled him high into the air on their\nshoulders while Jurand planted his hands on his hips and rolled his eyes.\nThe rain had slackened off and the sun shone on polished armour, and\nsharpened blades, and smiling faces.\nIt was hard not to feel much better.\nGuilt Is a Luxury\nT\nhe snow had all melted and left the world cold and comfortless. The icy\nslop that stood for ground seeped into Rikke’s boots and spattered up her\nsodden trousers.

Or so she told herself.\n“Would be a fine thing to be on a road,” she grumbled as she tried to tear\nher foot free of a tangle of clutching bramble and only succeeded in grazing\nherself worse.\nIsern had an unnatural trick of finding only the dry parts of a bog to put\nher feet on. Rikke swore she could’ve danced across a pond on the lily pads\nand never got her feet wet. “Who else might be tiptoeing down the roads\nnow, do we suppose?”\n“Stour Nightfall’s men,” said Rikke, sulkily.\n“Aye, and his uncle Scale Ironhand’s, and his father Black Calder’s. The\nthorns may scratch your downy-soft skin, but a lot shallower than their\nswords would.”\nRikke cursed as the clutching mud near sucked her boot right off. “We\ncould make for some high ground, at least.”\nIsern rubbed at the bridge of her nose like she never heard such folly.\n“Who else is having a high time on the high ground now, do you imagine?”\nRikke pushed her chagga pellet sourly from her top lip to her bottom.\n“Stour Nightfall’s scouts.”\n“And Scale Ironhand’s, and Black Calder’s. And since they’re there,\nswarming on the roads and the hills like lice on a log, where should we be?”\nRikke slapped an insect dead on the greasy back of her hand. “Down\nhere in the valley bottom, with the brambles, and the mud, and the bloody\nshitty biters.”\n“It’s almost like an unfriendly army swarming over your land is an\ninconvenience in all kinds o’ ways. You’re used to reckoning the world your\nplayground. Beset by dangers now, girl. Time to act like it.” Isern slipped\non through the thicket as quick and silent as a snake, leaving Rikke to\nstruggle after, pointlessly cursing.\nShe liked to think of herself as quite the rugged outdoorswoman, but in\nthis company she was a towny oaf. Isern-i-Phail knew all the ways, that was\nthe rumour. Even better’n her daddy had. Rikke had learned more from\nwatching her the last couple of weeks than she had from that fool Union\ntutor in Ostenhorm in a year. How to build a shelter from ferns. How to set\nrabbit traps, even if they hadn’t worked. How to reckon your course from\nthe way the moss grew on the tree trunks. How to tell a man from an animal\nin the forest just by their footfalls.\nSome folk said Isern was a witch, and no doubt she’d a witchy look and\na witch’s temper, but even she couldn’t magic food out of rocks and\nbogwater at the arse-end of winter.

Sadly.\nAs the sun sank behind the hills and left the valleys colder than ever,\nthey wriggled like worms into a crack between boulders, pressed together\nfor warmth, while outside the wind picked up and the slow drizzle turned to\na stinging sleet.\n“Reckon you could find a stick in this whole valley dry enough to take a\nflame?” whispered Rikke, rubbing her cold-fish hands together in her\nsmoking breath then wedging them in her pits where, rather than getting\nwarmed themselves, they only served to chill her whole body.\nIsern hunched over the pack that held their dwindling supplies like a\nmiser over his gold. “Even if I could, the smoke might bring hunters.”\n“Guess we’ll stay cold, then,” said Rikke in a small voice.\n“That’s the birth of spring for you, when your enemies have stole your\ndaddy’s hall so you’ve got no nice warm firepit to curl up beside.”\nRikke knew what folk said about her, and maybe her head didn’t have\nthe right parts in the right places, but she’d always had a sharp eye for\nthings. So in spite of the gloom and Isern’s nimble fingers, Rikke saw the\nhillwoman only ate half as much as she handed over. She saw it, and was\nthankful for it, and wished she had the bones to insist on fair shares, but she\nwas just so damn hungry. She stuffed her shred of dry meat down so\nquickly she swallowed her chagga pellet too without even noticing.\nWhile she licked the wondrous taste of stale bread from her teeth, she\nfound she was thinking of that lad she shot. That bit of dyed cloth around\nhis scrawny neck, like mothers give sons to keep the cold off. That hurt,\nconfused look he’d had. The same look she used to have, maybe, when the\nother children laughed at her twitching.\n“I killed that lad.” And she sniffed up a noseful of cold snot and spat it\naway.\n“Aye.” Isern trimmed off a chagga pellet and stuck it behind her lip.\n“You killed him all to bits, and robbed everyone who knew him, and cut all\nthe good he might ever do out of the world.”\nRikke blinked. “Well, you’re the one split his skull!”\n“That was a mercy. He’d have drowned on your arrow for sure.”\nRikke found she was rubbing at her back, trying to get her thumb up to\nwhere that shaft had been, but she couldn’t quite reach. No more than that\nboy had been able to. “Don’t reckon he deserved it, really.”\n“Deserving won’t make much difference to an arrow. The best defence\nagainst arrows is not a life nobly lived but to be the one who shoots them,\nd’you see?” Isern sat back against her, smelling of sweat and earth and\nchewed chagga. “They were your father’s enemies. Our enemies. Wasn’t as\nif there was any other choice.”\n“Not sure I even made a choice.” Rikke picked at her sore fingernails as\nshe picked at the memory, over and over. “Just fumbled the string. Just a\nstupid mistake.”\n“You could as well name it a happy accident.”"

Just a world that looks the other way and doesn’t\ncare a shit about either one of us.”\n“Why should it?”\n“I killed that lad.” Rikke’s foot twitched, and the twitch became a quiver\nup her leg, and the quiver became a shiver all over. “However I turn it\naround… just doesn’t feel right.”\nShe felt Isern’s hand firm on her shoulder, and was grateful for it. “If\nkilling folk ever starts to feel right, you’ve a worse kind of problem. Guilt\ncan sting, but you should be thankful for it.”\n“Thankful?”\n“Guilt is a luxury reserved for those still breathing and with no\nunbearable pain, cold or hunger demanding all their fickle attention. Long\nas guilt’s your big problem, girl…” Rikke saw the faint gleam of Isern’s\nteeth in the gathering darkness. “Things can’t be that bad.”\nShe slapped Rikke’s thigh and gave a witchy cackle, and maybe there\nwas some magic in it after all because Rikke cracked her first smile in a day\nor two, and that made her feel just a bit better. Your best shield is a smile,\nher father always said.\n“Why haven’t you just left me behind?” she asked.\n“I gave my word to your da.”\n“Aye, but everyone says you’re the most untrustworthy bitch in the\nwhole North.”\n“No one should know better than you what the things everyone says are\nworth. Truth is, I only care about keeping my word to folk I like. I seem\nuntrustworthy because there are only seven of those outside the hills.” She\nmade a fist of her tattooed hand, trembling tight. “To those seven, I am a\nrock.”\nRikke swallowed. “You like me, then?”\n“Meh.” Isern opened her blue fist and shook out the fingers with a\nclicking of knuckles. “About you, I remain to be convinced, but I like your\nfather and I gave him my word. That I’d try to put an end to your fits and\ncoax your Long Eye open and bring you back to him still breathing. The\nsmall matter of an invasion may have nudged him out of Uffrith, but the\ncommitment still stands, far as I’m concerned, wherever Stour Nightfall’s\nbastards might’ve driven him off to.” Her eyes flickered to Rikke, cunning\nas a fox that sees the coop unguarded. “But I’ll admit I’ve a selfish reason,\ntoo, which is a good thing for you, since selfish reasons are the only reasons\nyou should trust.”\n“What reason?”\nIsern opened her eyes very wide so they bulged from her filthy face.\n“Because I know there’s a better North waiting. A North free of the grip of\nScale Ironhand, and the one who pulls his strings, Black Calder, and the one\nwho pulls his strings even.

Beyond the yawning doorway, straining bodies and straining\nmachinery were rendered devilish by the glow of molten metal. Hammers\nclattered, chains rattled, steam hissed, labourers cursed. The music of\nmoney being made.\nOne-sixth of the Hill Street Foundry, after all, belonged to her.\nOne of the six great sheds was her property. Two of the twelve looming\nchimneys. One in every six of the new machines spinning inside, of the\ncoals in the great heaps shovelled in the yard, of the hundreds of twinkling\npanes of glass that faced the street. Not to mention one-sixth part of the\never-increasing profits. A flood of silver to put His Majesty’s mint to shame.\n“Best not to loiter, my lady,” murmured Zuri, fires gleaming in her eyes\nas she glanced about the darkened street.\nShe was right, as always. Most young ladies of Savine’s acquaintance\nwould have come over faint at the suggestion of visiting this part of Adua\nwithout a company of soldiers in attendance. But those who wish to occupy\nthe heights of society must be willing to dredge the depths from time to\ntime, when they see opportunities glitter in the filth.\n“On we go,” said Savine, boot heels squelching as she followed their\nlink-boy’s bobbing light into the maze of buildings. Narrow houses with\nwhole families wedged into every room leaned together, a spider’s web of\nflapping washing strung between, laden carts rumbling beneath and\nshowering filth to the rooftops. Where whole blocks had not been cleared to\nmake way for the new mills and manufactories, the crooked lanes reeked of\ncoal smoke and woodsmoke, blocked drains and no drains at all. It was a\nborough heaving with humanity. Seething with industry. And, most\nimportantly, boiling over with money to be made.\nSavine was by no means the only one who saw it. It was payday, and\nimpromptu merchants swarmed about the warehouses and forges, hoping to\nlighten the labourers’ purses as they spilled out after work, selling small\npleasures and meagre necessities. Selling themselves, if they could only\nfind a buyer.\nThere were others hoping to lighten purses by more direct means.\nGrubby little cutpurses weaving through the crowds. Footpads lurking in\nthe darkness of the alleys. Thugs slouching on the corners, keen to collect\non behalf of the district’s many moneylenders.\nRisks, perhaps, and dangers, but Savine had always loved the thrill of a\ngamble, especially when the game was rigged in her favour. She had long\nago learned that at least half of everything is presentation. Seem a victim,\nsoon become one. Seem in charge, people fall over themselves to obey.\nSo she walked with a swagger, dressed in the dizzy height of fashion,\nlowering her eyes for no one. She walked painfully erect, although Zuri’s"

She walked painfully erect, although Zuri’s\nearlier heaving on the laces of her corset gave her little choice. She walked\nas if it was her street—and indeed she did own five decaying houses further\ndown, packed to their rotten rafters with Gurkish refugees paying twice the\ngoing rent.\nZuri was a great reassurance on one side, Savine’s beautifully wrought\nshort steel a great reassurance on the other. Many young ladies had been\naffecting swords since Finree dan Brock caused a sensation by wearing one\nto court. Savine found that nothing lent one confidence like a length of\nsharpened metal close to hand.\nThe link-boy had stopped at a particularly wretched building, holding\nhis torch up to the peeling sign above its lintel.\n“This really the place?” he asked.\nSavine gathered her skirts so she could squat beside him and look in his\ndirt-smeared face. She wondered if he sponged the muck on as artfully as\nher maids did her powder, to arouse just the right amount of sympathy.\nClean children need no charity, after all.\n“This is the place. Our heartfelt thanks for your guidance.” And Zuri\nslipped a coin into Savine’s gloved hand so she could hold it out.\nShe was not at all above sentimental displays of generosity. The whole\npoint of squeezing one’s partners in private was so they could do the\nsqueezing in public. Savine, meanwhile, could smile ever so sweetly, and\ntoss coins to an urchin or two, and appear virtuous without the slightest\ndamage to her bottom line. When it comes to virtue, after all, appearances\nare everything.\nThe boy stared at the silver as though it was some legendary beast he\nhad heard of but never hoped to see. “For me?”\nShe knew that in her button and buckle manufactory in Holsthorm,\nsmaller and probably dirtier children were paid a fraction as much for a\nlong day’s hard labour. The manager insisted little fingers were best suited\nto little tasks, and cost only little wages, too. But Holsthorm was far away,\nand things in the distance seem very small. Even the sufferings of children.\n“For you.” She did not go as far as ruffling his hair, of course. Who\nknew what might be living in it?\n“Such a nice boy,” said Zuri, watching him hurry away into the gloom\nwith the coin in one fist and his sputtering torch in the other.\n“They all are,” said Savine. “When you have something they want.”\n“None more blessed, my scripture-teacher once declared, than those who\nlight the way for others.”\n“Was that the one who fathered a child on one of his other pupils?”\n“That’s him.” Zuri’s black brows thoughtfully rose. “So much for\nspiritual instruction.”\nThe grimy ale-hall fell silent as Savine swept in, as if some exotic jungle\nbeast had wandered off the street.\nZuri whipped out a cloth and wiped down a vacant section of the\ncounter, then, as Savine sat, she slipped out the pin and whisked away her\nhat without disturbing a hair.

Savine’s hat was probably worth more than this entire building,\nincluding the clientele. At a brief assay, they only reduced its value.\n“Well, well.” The man behind the counter was easing forwards, wiping\nhis hands on his stained apron and giving Savine a lingering look up and\ndown. “I’m tempted to say this is no place for a lady like you.”\n“We’ve only just met. You really have no idea what kind of lady I am.\nWhy, you could be taking your life in your hands just talking to me.”\n“Reckon I’m brave enough if you are.” By his squinty grin, he had\nsomehow convinced himself he held some appeal to the fairer sex. “What’s\nyour name?”\nShe planted one elbow on the stretch of counter Zuri had wiped so she\ncould lean closer and draw out both syllables. “Savine.”\n“That’s a lovely name.”\n“Oh, if you enjoy the tip, you’ll go mad for the whole thing.”\n“That so?” he purred at her. “How does it go?”\n“Savine… dan…” And she leaned even closer to deliver the punchline.\n“Glokta.”\nIf a name had been a knife and she had cut his throat with hers, the\nblood could not have drained more quickly from his face. He gave a\nstrangled cough, took a step back and nearly fell over one of his own\nbarrels.\n“Lady Savine.” Majir was coming from an upstairs office, wooden steps\ncreaking under her considerable weight. “What an honour.”\n“Isn’t it, though? Your man and I were just getting acquainted.”\nMajir glanced towards the ghost-faced barman. “Would you like him to\napologise?”\n“For what? Not being as brave as he claimed? If we executed men for\nthat, I swear there wouldn’t be a dozen left alive in the Union, eh, Zuri?”\nZuri clasped Savine’s hat sadly to her breast. “Heroes are in lamentably\nshort supply.”\nMajir cleared her throat. “If I’d known you were coming all the way\ndown here yourself—”\n“If I spent all my time shut up with Mother, we would kill each other,”\nsaid Savine. “And I feel that business should be conducted, whenever\npossible, in person. Otherwise one’s partners can convince themselves that\none’s eyes are not on the details. My eyes are always on the details, Majir.”\nIn low company, Savine could be low. These were bullies, so they\nneeded to be bullied. It was the language they understood. Majir’s thick\nneck shifted as she swallowed. “Who would dare doubt it?” And she laid a\nflat leather pouch on the counter.\n“It’s all there?”\n“A promissory note from the banking house of Valint and Balk.”\n“Really?” Valint and Balk had a dark reputation, even for a bank.\nSavine’s father had often warned her never to deal with them, because once\nyou owe Valint and Balk, the debt is never done.

She tossed the pouch to\nZuri, who peered inside and gave the smallest nod. “It’s coming to\nsomething when even the bandits are using the bank.”\nMajir mildly raised one brow. “Honest women have the law to protect\nthem. Bandits must take more care with their earnings.”\n“You’re a darling.” Savine reached across the counter to pinch her fat\ncheek and give it an affectionate tug. “Thank you, Zuri. You’re a darling,\ntoo.” Her companion was already sliding the hatpin back into position.\n“If you don’t mind,” said Majir, “I’ll have a few boys follow you out of\nthe neighbourhood. I could never forgive myself if something were to\nhappen to you.”\n“Oh, come now. If something happened to me, your own forgiveness\nwould be the least of your problems.”\n“True.” Majir watched her turn away, big fists pressed into the counter.\n“Do pass my regards to your father.”\nSavine laughed. “Let’s not demean ourselves by pretending my father\ngives a dry fuck for your regards.” And she blew a kiss at the terrified\nbarman on her way out.\nDietam dan Kort, famed architect, was a man who gave every appearance\nof being in control. His desk, scattered with maps, surveys and\ndraughtsman’s drawings, was certainly a wonder of engineering. Savine had\nmoved among the most powerful men in the realm and still doubted she had\never seen a larger. It filled his office so completely, there was only the\nnarrowest of passages around the edges to reach his chair. He must have\nneeded help to squeeze himself through every morning. She wondered if\nshe should recommend her corset-maker.\n“Lady Savine,” he intoned. “What an honour.”\n“Isn’t it, though?” She made him lean dangerously far across the desk in\norder to kiss her hand. Savine studied his, meanwhile, big and broad with\nfingers scarred from hard work. A self-made man. His greying hair was\npainstakingly scraped across a pate quite obviously bald. A proud and a vain\nman. She noticed a slight fraying of the cuffs on his once-splendid coat. A\nman in straitened circumstances, intent on appearing otherwise.\n“To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” he asked.\nShe settled herself opposite while Zuri whisked off her hat. A lady of\ntaste should appear to make no effort. The right things simply happen\naround her. “The opportunity for investment you mentioned at our last\nmeeting,” she said.\nKort brightened considerably. “You have come to discuss it?”\n“I have come to do it.”\nZuri placed Majir’s pouch on the desk as delicately as if it had been\ndeposited by a summer breeze. It looked very small on that immense\nexpanse of green leather. But that was the magic of banks. They could\nrender the priceless tiny, the immense worthless.\nThe slightest sheen of sweat had sprung from Kort’s forehead. “It’s all\nthere?”\n“A promissory note from Valint and Balk.

I hope that will suffice?”\n“Of course!” He was unable to disguise a note of eager greed as he\nreached across the desk. “I believe we agreed a twentieth share—”\nSavine placed one fingertip on the corner of the pouch. “You mentioned\na twentieth. I remained silent.”\nHis hand froze. “Then…?”\n“A fifth.”\nThere was a pause. While he decided how outraged he could afford to\nbe, and Savine decided how little to appear to care.\n“A fifth?” His already ruddy face turned positively volcanic. “My first\ninvestors received half as much for twice the money! I only own a fifth\nmyself, and I near as damn it dug the thing with my own hands! A fifth?\nHave you lost all reason?”\nTo Savine, there was no more enticing invitation than a door slammed in\nher face. “One man’s mad is another’s perceptive,” she said, her smile not\neven dented. “Your canal takes a clever route and your bridge is a wonder.\nTruly, I congratulate you on it. In a few years, they’ll be building everything\nfrom iron. But it isn’t finished and you’ve run out of money.”\n“I have two months’ reserves!”\n“You have two weeks’ at best.”\n“Then I have two weeks to find a more reasonable investor!”\n“You have two hours.” Savine sent her brows up very high. “I am\nvisiting with Tilde dan Rucksted tonight.”\n“Who?”\n“Tilde, the young wife of Lord Marshal Rucksted. A wonderfully sweet-\ntempered girl, but phew, what a gossip!” And she glanced up for\nconfirmation.\n“It pains me to speak ill of one of God’s creatures,” admitted Zuri, with\na pious fluttering of her long lashes, “but she is an abysmal blabbermouth.”\n“When I confide, in strictest confidence, that you are short of\ninvestment, lacking the necessary permissions and troubled by restless\nworkmen, it will be all over town before sunup.”\n“Sure as printing it in a pamphlet,” said Zuri, sadly.\n“Good luck finding an investor then, reasonable or otherwise.”\nIt had only taken a moment for Kort to go from bright red to deathly\npale, and Savine burst out laughing. “Don’t be silly, I won’t do that!” She\nstopped laughing. “Because you are going to sign one-fifth of your\nenterprise over to me. Now. Then I can confide in Tilde that I just made the\ninvestment of a lifetime, and she won’t be able to resist investing herself.\nShe’s not only loose-lipped, you see, but tight-fisted, too.”\n“Greed is a quality the priests abhor.” Zuri sighed. “Especially the rich\nones.”\n“But so widespread these days,” lamented Savine. “If Lady Rucksted\nsees some gain in it, I daresay she can persuade her husband to make a\nbreach in Casamir’s Wall so you can extend your canal into the Three\nFarms.” And Savine could sell the worthless slum buildings she had bought\non the canal’s likely route back to herself at an immense profit. “The\nmarshal’s notoriously stubborn for most of us but to his wife he’s a"

You know how it is with old men and their young brides.”\nKort was trapped halfway between anger and ambition. Savine rather\nliked him there. Most animals, after all, look better in a cage. “Extend my\ncanal… into the Three Farms?”\n“The first to do so.” Where it could service Savine’s three textile mills\nand the Hill Street Foundry, incidentally, and sharply raise their\nproductivity. “I daresay—for a friend—I could even arrange a visit of His\nMajesty’s Inquisitors to a labour meeting. I imagine your troublesome\nworkers will be far more pliable after a few stern examples are made.”\n“Stern examples,” threw in Zuri, “are something the priests are always\nin favour of.”\nKort was almost drooling. Savine thought they had better stop before he\nneeded a change of trousers.\n“A tenth part,” he offered, in a voice rather hoarse.\n“Pffft.” Savine stood and Zuri eased forward with her hat, spinning the\npin in her long fingers with the delicacy of a magician. “You’re an architect\nto rival Kanedias himself, but you’re entirely lost in the maze of Aduan\nsociety. You need a guide, and I’m the best there is. Be a darling and give\nthe fifth before I take a quarter. You know I’d be a bargain at a third.”\nKort sagged, his chin settling into the roll of fat beneath it, his eyes fixed\nresentfully upon her. Clearly, he was not a man who liked to lose. But\nwhere would be the fun in beating men who did?\n“Very well. One-fifth.”\n“A notary from the firm of Temple and Kahdia is already drawing up the\npapers. He will be in touch.” She turned towards the door.\n“They warned me,” Kort grunted as he slid Valint and Balk’s note from\nthe pouch. “That you care about nothing but money.”\n“Why, what a pompous crowd they are. Beyond a point I passed long\nago, I don’t even care about money.” Savine flicked the brim of her hat in\nfarewell. “But how else is one to keep score?”\nA Little Public Hanging\n“I\nhate bloody hangings,” said Orso.\nOne of the whores tittered as if he’d cracked quite the joke. It was the\nfalsest laugh he had ever heard, and when it came to false laughter, he was\nquite the connoisseur. Everyone was false in his presence, and he the worst\nactor of all.\n“I guess you could stop it,” said Hildi. “If you wanted.”\nOrso frowned up at her, perched on the wall with her legs crossed and\nher chin propped on one palm.\n“Well… I suppose…” Strange how the idea had never occurred to him\nbefore. He pictured himself springing onto the scaffold, insisting these poor\npeople be pardoned, ushering them back to their miserable lives to tearful\nthanks and rapturous applause. Then he sighed. “But… one really shouldn’t\ninterfere with the workings of the judiciary.”"

Then he sighed. “But… one really shouldn’t\ninterfere with the workings of the judiciary.”\nLies, like everything that left his mouth, engineered to make him appear\njust a touch less detestable. He wondered who he was trying to fool. Hildi\nundoubtedly saw straight through it. The truth was, when it came to\nstopping this, as with so much else, he simply couldn’t be arsed. He took\nanother pinch of pearl dust, his heavy snorts ringing out as the Inquisitor in\ncharge stepped to the front of the scaffold and the crowd fell breathlessly\nsilent.\n“These three…people,” and the Inquisitor swept an arm towards the\nchained convicts, each held under the armpit by a hooded executioner, “are\nmembers of the outlawed group known as the Breakers, convicted of High\nTreason against the Crown!”\n“Treason!” someone screeched, then dissolved into coughing. It was a\nstill day, so a bad one for the vapours. Not that there were many good days\nfor the vapours lately, what with the new chimneys sprouting up all over\nAdua. People at the very back must have been struggling to see the scaffold\nthrough the murk.\n“They have been found guilty of setting fires and breaking machinery, of\nincitement to riot and sheltering fugitives from the king’s justice! Have you\nanything to say?”\nThe first prisoner, a heavyset fellow with a beard, evidently did. “We’re\nfaithful subjects of His Majesty!” he bellowed in a hero’s voice, all manly\nbass and quivering passion. “All we want is an honest wage for honest\nwork!”\n“I’d sooner take a dishonest wage for no work at all,” grunted Tunny.\nYolk burst out laughing while swigging from his bottle and sprayed a\nreeking mist of spirits, which settled over the wig of a well-dressed old lady\njust in front.\nA man with spectacular grey side whiskers, presumably her husband,\nclearly felt they were not treating the occasion with appropriate gravity.\n“You people are a damn disgrace!” he snapped, rounding on them in a fury.\n“That so?” Tunny pushed his tongue into his grizzled cheek. “Hear that,\nOrso? You’re a damn disgrace.”\n“Orso?” muttered the man. “Not—”\n“Yes.” Tunny showed his yellow grin and Orso winced. He hated it\nwhen Tunny used him to bully people. Almost as much as he hated\nhangings. But somehow he could never bring himself to stop either one.\nThe side-whisker enthusiast had turned pale as a freshly laundered sheet,\nsomething Orso had not seen in some time. “Your Highness, I had no idea.\nPlease accept my—”\n“No need.” Orso waved a lazy hand, wine-stained lace cuff flapping, and\ntook another pinch of pearl dust. “I am a damn disgrace. Notoriously so.”\nHe gave the man a reassuring pat on the shoulder, realised he had smeared\ndust all over his coat and tried ineffectually to brush it off.

I don’t have any.” Or so he often said. The truth\nwas he sometimes felt he had too many. He was dragged so violently in a\ndozen different directions that he could not move at all.\nHe took one more pinch for good measure. Peering down through\nwatering eyes, he noticed the box was getting dangerously empty.\n“Hildi!” he muttered, waving it at her. “Empty.”\nShe sprang down from the wall and drew herself up to her full height.\nWhich put her about on a level with his ribs. “Again? Who shall I go to?”\n“Majir?”\n“Y’owe Majir a hundred and fifty-one marks. Said she can’t give you\nmore credit.”\n“Spizeria, then?”\n“Y’owe him three hundred and six. Same story.”\n“How the hell did that happen?”\nHildi gave Tunny, Yolk and the whores a significant glance. “You want\nme to answer that?”\nOrso racked his brains to think of someone else, then gave up. If he\nexcelled at anything, after all, it was giving up. “For pity’s sake, Hildi,\neveryone knows I’m good for it. I’ll be coming into a considerable legacy\none of these days.” No less than the Union, and everything in it, and all its\nunliftable weight of care, and impossible responsibility, and crushing\nexpectation. He grimaced and tossed her the box.\n“You owe me nine marks,” she muttered.\n“Shoo!” Orso tried to wave her away, got his little finger painfully\ntangled in his cuff and had to rip it free. “Just get it done!”\nShe gave a long-suffering sigh, jammed that ancient soldier’s cap down\nover her blonde curls and stepped off into the crowd.\n“She’s a funny little thing, your errand girl,” warbled one of the whores,\ndragging too heavily on his arm.\n“She’s my valet,” said Orso, frowning, “and she’s a fucking treasure.”\nOn the scaffold, meanwhile, the bearded man was bellowing out the\nBreakers’ manifesto with ever more emotion. The noise from the crowd was\ngrowing but, much to the upset of the Inquisitor, he was starting to strike a\nchord. Calls of support were breaking through the mockery.\n“No more machines!” the bearded man roared, veins bulging in his thick\nneck. “No more seizure of common land!”\nHe seemed a useful fellow. More useful than Orso, certainly. “What a\nbloody waste,” he muttered.\n“The Open Council shouldn’t just be for the nobles! Every man should\nhave a voice—”\n“Enough!” snarled the Inquisitor, waving one of the executioners\nforward. The prisoner kept trying to speak as the noose was pulled tight, but\nhis words were drowned by the rising anger of the crowd.\nIt was a riddle. This man, born with no advantages, believed in\nsomething so much he was willing to die for it. Orso, born with everything,\ncould scarcely make himself get out of bed of a morning. Or, indeed, an\nafternoon."

Her\nperfume was so sickeningly strong, it was a wonder pigeons didn’t drop\nstunned from the sky around her.\nThe Inquisitor gave a nod.\nRather than needing strong men or horses to haul up the condemned,\nsome enterprising fellow had devised a system whereby prisoners could be\ndropped through the scaffold floor at a touch upon a lever. There was an\ninvention to make everything more efficient these days, after all. Why\nwould killing people be an exception?\nA strange sound rose from the crowd as the rope snapped taut. Part cheer\nof joy, part hoot of derision, part groan of discomfort, but mostly gasps of\nrelief. Relief that it wasn’t them at the end of the rope.\n“Damn it,” muttered Orso, working a finger into his collar. There was\nnothing even faintly satisfying in this. Even if these people really were\nenemies of the state, they hardly looked like very dangerous ones.\nThe next in line to receive the king’s justice was a girl who might not yet\nhave been sixteen. Her eyes, wide in bruised sockets, flickered from the\nopen trapdoor to the Inquisitor as he stepped towards her. “Have you\nanything to say?”\nShe appeared hardly to comprehend. Orso found himself wishing the\nvapours were thicker, and that he could not see her face at all.\n“Please,” said the man beside her. There were tears streaking his dirty\ncheeks. “Take me but, please—”\n“Shut him up,” snapped the Inquisitor, not at all enjoying his part in this\ngrisly pantomime. A few desultory vegetables were being tossed at the\nscaffold, but whether they were intended for the accused or those carrying\nout the sentence, it was hard to say. There was a dark stain spreading down\nthe front of the girl’s dress.\n“Yuck,” said Yolk. “She’s pissed herself.”\nOrso frowned sideways. “That’s what disgusts you?”\n“I’ve seen you piss yourself often enough,” sneered Tunny at Yolk, and\nthe whores spilled more false laughter. The side whiskers of the man in\nfront twitched as he ground his teeth.\nOrso gritted his as he looked to the scaffold. Hildi had been right, he\ncould stop this. If not him, who? If not now, when?\nThere was some problem with the girl’s noose, the Inquisitor hissing\nfuriously at one of the executioners as he dragged his hood up over his\nsweaty face to peer at the knots.\nOrso was just about to step forward. Was just about to roar, Stop!\nBut circumstances always conspired to stop him doing the right thing.\nHe heard a soft, high voice in his ear. “Your Highness.”\nOrso turned to see the broad, flat and decidedly unwelcome face of\nBremer dan Gorst at his shoulder.\n“Gorst, you tiresome bastard.” The insult caused not the slightest\nreaction. Nothing ever did. “How did you track me down?”"

All he did was look, but\nit was enough to make Yolk’s laughter sputter into nervous silence. He\nmight sound a clown, but His Majesty’s First Guard was not a man you\ntrifled with.\n“Any chance I can bring the whores with me?” asked Orso. “I’ve paid\nfor the whole day.” It was his turn to face Gorst’s fish-eyed stare. He sighed.\n“Would you conduct the ladies to their residence, Tunny?”\n“Oh, I’ll conduct a symphony with ’em, Your Highness.” More false\ngiggling.\nOrso turned away without much reluctance. He hated bloody hangings,\nbut the girls had wanted to go and he hated disappointing people, too. As a\nresult of which, it seemed, he disappointed everyone. At his back, there was\nthat strange sound between gasp and cheer as the next trapdoor dropped\nopen.\nOrso tossed his hat onto the bald head of a bust of Bayaz, congratulating\nhimself that it came to rest on the legendary wizard at a pleasingly rakish\nangle.\nThe tapping of his boot heels echoed in the vast spaces of the salon as he\ncrossed a sea of gleaming tiles to the tiny island of furniture in its centre.\nThe High Queen of the Union sat fearsomely erect there, dripping with\ndiamonds, growing out of the chaise like a spectacular orchid from a gilded\npot. It hardly needed to be said that he’d known her his whole life, but the\nsheer regality of the woman still took him aback every time.\n“Mother,” he said, in Styrian. Using the tongue of the country they\nactually ruled only aggravated her, and he knew from long experience that\naggravating Queen Terez was never, ever worth it. “I was just on my way to\nvisit when Gorst found me.”\n“You must take me for a rare kind of fool,” she said, angling her face\ntowards him.\n“No, no.” He bent to brush one heavily powdered cheek with his lips.\n“Just the usual kind.”\n“Really, Orso, your accent has become appalling.”\n“Well, now that Styria is almost entirely controlled by our enemies, I get\nso little chance to practice.”\nShe plucked a minute tuft of fluff from his jacket. “Are you\nintoxicated?”\n“Can’t think why I would be.” Orso picked up the decanter with a\nflourish and poured himself a glass. “I’ve snorted just the right amount of\npearl dust to even out the husk I smoked this morning.” He rubbed at his"

It\nwas quite winning when you were seventeen. At twenty-two, it began to\nbecome tiresome. At twenty-seven, it looks positively desperate.”\n“You have no idea, Mother.” Orso dropped into a chair so savagely\nuncomfortable it was like being punched in the arse. “I have long been\nthoroughly ashamed of myself.”\n“You could try doing something to be proud of. Have you considered\nthat?”\n“I’ve spent whole days considering it.” He frowned discerningly through\nthe wine as he held it up to the light from the giant windows. “But doing it\nreally feels like such a lot of effort.”\n“Frankly, your father could use your support. He is a weak man, Orso.”\n“So you never tire of telling him.”\n“And these are difficult times. The last war did… not end well.”\n“It ended pretty well if you’re King Jappo of Styria.”\nHis mother pronounced each word with icy precision. “Which you…\nare…not.”\n“Sadly, for all concerned.”\n“You are King Jappo’s mortal enemy and the rightful heir to all he and\nthe thrice-damned Snake of Talins have stolen, and it is high time you took\nyour position seriously! We have enemies everywhere. Inside our borders,\ntoo.”\n“I am aware. I just attended the hanging of three of them. Two peasants\nand a girl of fifteen. She pissed herself. I’ve never felt prouder.”\n“Then I trust you come to me in a receptive mood.” Orso’s mother gave\ntwo sharp claps and Lord Chamberlain Hoff strutted in. With waistcoat\nbulging around his belly and legs stick-like in tight breeches, he looked like\nnothing so much as a prize rooster jealously patrolling the farmyard.\n“Your Majesty.” He bowed so low to the queen, he virtually buffed the\ntiles with his nose. “Your Highness.” He bowed just as low to Orso but in a\nmanner that somehow expressed boundless contempt. Or perhaps Orso only\nsaw his own contempt for himself reflected in that obsequious smile. “I\nhave positively scoured the entire Circle of the World for the most eligible\ncandidates. Dare one suggest that the future High Queen of the Union waits\namong them?”\n“Oh, good grief.” Orso let his head drop back, staring up towards the\nbeautifully painted ceiling of the peoples of the world kneeling before a\ngolden sun. “The parade again?”\n“Ensuring the succession is not a joke,” pronounced his mother.\n“Not a funny one, anyway.”\n“Don’t be facetious, Orso.

A pale girl with an absurdly\nlong neck smiled winsomely from the canvas.\n“Lady Sithrin dan Harnveld,” announced the lord chamberlain.\nOrso sank lower into his chair. “Do I really want a wife who measures\nthe distance from her chin to her tits in miles?”\n“Artistic licence, Your Highness,” explained Hoff.\n“Call it art, you can get away with anything.”\n“She is quite presentable in the flesh,” said the queen. “And her family\ncan be traced back to the time of Harod the Great.”\n“A true thoroughbred,” interjected the lord chamberlain.\n“She’s stupid as a horse, all right,” said Orso. “And you can’t have an\nidiot for both king and queen.”\n“Next,” grated out Orso’s mother, a second pair of footmen nearly\ncolliding with the first as they carted in a painting of a slyly smirking\nStyrian.\n“The Countess Istarine of Affoia is a proven politician, and would bring\nus valuable allies in Styria.”\n“From the looks of her, she’s more likely to bring me a dose of the cock-\nrot.”\n“I had imagined you would be immune from constant exposure,”\nobserved the queen, waving the portrait away with an exquisite flourish of\nher fingers.\n“Such a shame I never see you dance any more, Mother.” She danced\nsuperbly. Sometimes she even seemed to enjoy it.\n“Your father is an absolute oaf of a partner.”\nOrso gave a sad smile. “He does his best.”\n“This is Messela Sivirine Sistus,” proclaimed the lord chamberlain,\n“younger daughter of the Emperor Dantus Goltus—”\n“He doesn’t even merit the older daughter?” demanded the queen,\nbefore Orso had the chance to raise his own objections. “I think not.”\nAnd so it went, as Orso marked the turning of morning into afternoon by\nthe steadily decreasing level of wine in the decanter, and dismissed the\nflower of womanhood, one by one.\n“How could I abide a wife taller than me?”\n“She’s a worse drunk than I am.”\n“At least we know she’s fertile, she’s borne two bastards that I know\nabout.”\n“Is that a nose on her face or a prick?”\nHe almost wished he was back at the hanging. That, he could\ntheoretically have stopped. Over his mother, he was utterly powerless. His\nonly chance was to wait her out.

Or at any rate their\nabject terror.”\n“A crippled worm,” spat the queen. “A torturer!”\n“But our torturer, eh, Mother? Our torturer. And I understand his\ndaughter has made herself quite spectacularly rich.”\n“Money made through trade, and dealings, and investments.” The queen\nspat the words as though they were criminal enterprises. For all Orso knew,\nSavine’s dealings were criminal enterprises. He wouldn’t at all have put it\npast her.\n“Oh, come now, money shamefully made from trade fills the same holes\nin the treasury as the kind nobly wrung from the misery of the peasantry.”\n“She is too old! You are too old, and she is even older than you are.”\n“But she has impeccable manners and is still quite the celebrated\nbeauty.” He waved a loose hand towards the doorway. “She’d make a\nprettier portrait than any of those piglets, and the painter wouldn’t even\nhave to lie. Queen Savine sounds rather well.” He gave a chuckle. “It even\nrhymes.”\nHis mother was an icicle of fury. “Do you do this just to annoy me?”\n“Not just to annoy you.”\n“Promise me you will have nothing to do with that ambitious worm of a\nwoman.”\n“With Savine dan Glokta?” Orso sat back with a bemused expression.\n“Her mother’s a commoner, her father’s a torturer and she made her money\nfrom business.” He shook the last drops from the decanter into his glass.\n“Quite apart from which, really, she’s far too bloody old.”\n“Oh,” he gasped. “Oh! Oh fuck!”\nHe arched his back, clutched desperately at the edge of the desk, kicked\na pot of pens onto the floor, smacked his head against the wall and sent a\nlittle shower of plaster across his shoulders. He tried desperately to squirm\naway, but she had him by the balls. Quite literally.\nHe crushed his face up, nearly swallowed his tongue, coughed and\nhissed one more desperate, “Fuck!” through gritted teeth, then sagged back\nwith a whimper, kicked and sagged again, legs shuddering weakly with\naching after-spasms.\n“Fuck,” he breathed.\nSavine looked around, lips pursed, then took Orso’s half-full wine glass\nand spat into it. Even under those circumstances, he noticed, she held it by\nthe stem in the most elegant manner. She scraped her tongue against her\nfront teeth, spat again and set the glass down on the desk next to hers.\nOrso watched his seed float around in the wine. “That… is somewhat\ndisgusting.”"

One day, madam, I shall be your king!”\n“And your queen will no doubt spit your come into a golden box to be\nshared out on holidays for the public good. My congratulations to you both,\nYour Highness.”\nHe gave vent to a silly giggle. “Why does someone as altogether perfect\nas you waste her energy on a dolt like me?”\nShe pushed out her lips discerningly, as though considering the mystery,\nand for a strange, stupid moment he almost asked her. The words tickled at\nhis lips. There was no one better suited to him. She had all the qualities he\nwished he had. So sharp. So disciplined. So decisive. Besides, it would have\nbeen worth it just for the look on his mother’s face. He almost asked her.\nBut circumstances always conspired to stop him doing the right thing.\n“I can only think of one reason,” she said, hitching her skirts up and\nwriggling onto the desk beside him.\nHis sweaty arse juddered against the leather as he slid down onto still-\nwobbly legs, trousers flopping about his ankles. He flipped the box open\nand sprinkled some pearl dust onto the back of his hand, sniffed half\nhimself then offered her the rest.\n“Let it never be said I think only of myself,” he said as she covered one\nnostril to snort it up. She blinked at the ceiling for a moment, eyelids\nfluttering, as if she might sneeze. Then she dropped back on her elbows,\nworking her hips towards him.\n“Get to it, then.”\n“You really are in no mood for romance today, are you?”\nShe slid her fingers into his hair, then twisted his head somewhat\npainfully down between her legs. “My time is valuable.”\n“The naked gall.” Orso gave a sigh as he hooked her leg over his\nshoulder, sliding his hand down the bare skin, hearing her gasp, feeling her\nshudder. He kissed gently at her shin, at her knee, at her thigh. “Is there no\nend to the demands of one’s subjects?”\nThe Breakers\n“W\nhat sort of a name is Vick, anyway?”\n“Short for Victarine.”\n“Very fucking fancy,” sneered Grise. Vick hadn’t known her long, but\nshe was already getting tired of her. “Daresay you’ve got a fucking ‘dan’ in\nyour name, too, eh, your ladyship?”\nShe was joking. But things had to get pretty funny before Vick started\nlaughing, and this didn’t qualify.\nShe held Grise’s eye. “I did have a ‘dan’ in my name, once. My father\nwas Master of the Royal Mints. Had a great big apartment in the Agriont.”\nAnd Vick nodded towards her best idea of where the fortress was, though\nthe points of the compass were hard to tell apart in a mouldy cellar. “Right\nnext to the palace. Big enough for a statue of Harod the Great in the hall.\nLife fucking size.”"

Big enough for a statue of Harod the Great in the hall.\nLife fucking size.”\nGrise had quite the frown on her round face now, light flickering across\nit as boots, and hoofs, and cartwheels clattered past the little windows high\nup near the ceiling. “You grew up in the Agriont?”\n“You weren’t listening. My father had an apartment there. But when I\nwas eight years old, he trod on the wrong toes and the Inquisition took him.\nI hear it was Old Sticks himself who asked the questions.”\nThat changed the atmosphere, Grise flinching a little and Tallow\nblinking into the shadows as if the Arch Lector himself might be loitering\nbehind the dusty shelves with a dozen Practicals.\n“My father was innocent. Of what they accused him of, anyway. But\nonce Old Sticks got started…” Vick slapped the table with a bang, Tallow\njumping so high he nearly hit the ceiling. “He leaked confessions like a\nbroken drain. High Treason. They sent him to Angland. To the camps right\nup North.” Vick didn’t feel much like it, but she grinned. “And no one likes\nto split up a happy family. So they sent my ma with him. My ma, and my\nbrother, and my sisters, and me. The camps, Grise. That’s where I grew up.\nSo don’t question my commitment to the cause. Not ever.”\nYou could hear the ill squelch as Tallow swallowed. “What are the\ncamps like?”\n“You get by.”\nOh, the filth, pain, hunger, death, injustice and betrayal that she buried in\nthat phrase. The black chill of the mines, the searing glow of the furnaces,\nthe gnashing rage and sobbing desperation, the bodies in the snow. Vick\nforced her face to stay blank, pressed down the past like you might press\ndown the lid on a box full of maggots.\n“You get by,” she said, firmer. When you tell a lie, you have to sound\nlike you believe it. Goes double for the ones you tell yourself.\nGrise spun around as the door squealed open, but it was only Sibalt\ncome at last, Moor big and dour at his shoulder. He planted his fists on the\ntable and took a heavy breath, that noble face of his sadly sagging.\n“What is it?” asked Tallow, in a tiny voice.\n“They hanged Reed,” said Sibalt. “They hanged Cudber. They hanged\nhis daughter.”\nGrise stared at him. “She was fifteen.”\n“What for?” asked Tallow.\n“Just for talking.” Sibalt put his hand on the boy’s thin shoulder and\ngave it a squeeze. “Just for organising. Just for trying to get workers to\nstand together and speak with one voice. That’s treason now.”\n“Then the time for talk’s fucking past!” snarled Grise.\nVick was angry as anyone. But she’d learned in the camps that every\nfeeling is a weakness.

He wouldn’t.”\n“Not even when they put the irons to his daughter?” Grise had nothing\nto say to that, shock gradually wiping the anger off her face. “Whatever\nnames they knew, they’ll have given up. Lots of other names, too, ’cause\nonce you run out of truth, you start spilling lies.”\nMoor shook his big lump of a head. “Not Reed.”\n“Yes, Reed, Cudber, his daughter, yes, you or me or anyone. The\nInquisition’ll come for whoever they knew about, and soon. So who did\nthey know about?”\n“Just me.” Sibalt looked at her calm and level. “I made sure of it.”\n“Then you have to get out of Adua. For your sake, for the sake of the\ncause.”\n“Who the fuck are you to give orders?” Grise leaned down over her with\na stabbing finger. “You’re newest here!”\n“So maybe I’m thinking most clearly.” Vick let her hand lie on her belt\nbuckle where her brass knuckles were hidden. She didn’t rate Grise much of\na threat, for all her bulk. People who shout a lot tend to take a while\nworking up to more. But Vick was ready to put her down if she had to. And\nwhen Vick put someone down, she made sure they went down hard.\nLucky for Grise, Sibalt laid a gentle hand on her shoulder and eased her\nback. “Vick’s right. I have to get out of Adua. Just as soon as we strike our\nblow.” And Moor slid out a dirty paper and unrolled it across the table. A\nmap of the city. Sibalt tapped a spot in the Three Farms. Not far from where\nthey’d started building that new canal. “The Hill Street Foundry.”\n“Though Hill Street’s gone,” said Moor, in that plodding way he had,\n“since they pulled it down to build the Foundry.”\n“They’re fitting new engines there,” said Sibalt.\nTallow nodded. “I passed ’em on the way. Engines that’ll put two\nhundred men and women out of work, I hear.”\n“And what?” muttered Vick, frowning. “We’re going to break ’em?”\n“We’re going to blow the lot to hell,” said Grise. “With Gurkish Fire.”\nVick blinked at her. “How much have you got?”\n“Three barrels,” said Sibalt. “That be enough, you think?”\n“In the right places, maybe. You know how to use it?”\n“Not really.” Sibalt grinned at her. “But you do. Used it in the mines,\ndidn’t you? In Angland.”\n“I did.” Vick narrowed her eyes at him. “Where did you get it?”\n“What do you care?” snapped Grise.\n“I care that your source is reliable. I care that it’s going to work. I care\nthat it’s not going to pop too early and shower bits of us all over the Three\nFarms.”"

People get killed.”\n“Only those that deserve it,” said Grise.\n“Once the killing starts, it rarely sticks to those who deserve it.”\n“You scared?”\n“If you’re not scared, you’re mad or stupid, and there’s no place for\neither on a task like this. We need to plan every detail.”\n“I got a job there labouring,” said Moor. “I can map it out.”\n“Good,” said Vick. “More plans mean fewer risks.”\nGrise sneered her disgust. “All you ever fucking talk about is the risks!”\n“Someone needs to. This has to be something we choose, not something\nwe blunder into ’cause we’re sore and can’t think of anything better to do\nwith ourselves.” She looked around those four faces, strange in the\nflickering light of the cellar. “This is what you all want, is it?”\n“It’s what I fucking want,” said Grise.\n“It’s what I want,” said Sibalt.\n“Aye,” rumbled Moor.\nShe looked at Tallow last. He couldn’t be older than fifteen himself, and\nmight only have had three good meals in that whole stretch. Reminded her\nof her brother, a little. Those skinny wrists sticking from frayed sleeves just\na touch too short. Trying to put a hard face on but beaming fears and doubts\nout like a lighthouse through those big damp eyes.\n“There’s a Great Change coming,” he said, finally. “That’s what I want.”\nVick smiled a grim smile. “Well, if I learned one thing in the camps, it’s\nthat talking isn’t enough.” She realised she’d closed her fingers to make a\nfist. “You want a thing, you have to fight for it.”\nShe stayed straddling him for a while afterwards, his chest pressed against\nhers with each snatched breath. Kissing at his lip. Biting at it. Then with a\ngrunt, she slid off him, rolled onto her side next to him on the narrow bed,\ndragging the blankets up over her bare shoulder. It felt chill now they were\ndone, frost showing in the smudges of lamplight at the corners of the little\nwindow.\nThey both lay silent, he staring at the ceiling, she staring at him. Outside\nthe carts clattered by, and the traders offered their wares, and that drunk on\nthe corner roared his meaningless pain and fury at nothing and no one.

Better if they don’t know we’re…” He\nslipped his hand up onto her ribs, rubbing at that old burn on her side with\nhis thumb, trying to dig up the right word for what they were. “Together.”\n“In here, we’re together.” She jerked her head towards the warped door\nin the warped frame. “Out there…” Out there, everyone stood on their own.\nHe frowned at the little gap of coarse sheet between them as if it was a\ngreat divide that could never be crossed. “Sorry I can’t tell you where the\nGurkish Fire comes from.”\n“Best if no one knows more than they have to.”\n“It’ll work.”\n“I believe you,” she said. “I trust you.” Vick trusted no one. She’d\nlearned that in the camps, along with how to lie. Learned to lie so well, she\ncould take one tiny sliver of truth and beat it out, like the goldsmiths\nbeating a nugget of gold into leaf, till it could cover a whole field of lies.\nSibalt didn’t doubt her for a moment.\n“I wish I’d met you sooner,” he said. “Things might be different.”\n“You didn’t and they’re not. So let’s take what we can get, eh?”\n“By the Fates, you’re a hard case, Vick.”\n“We’re none of us hard as we seem.” She slipped her hand around the\nback of his head, through the dark hair scattered with grey, held it firm,\nlooked him in the eye and asked one more time. “You’re sure, Collem?\nYou’re sure this is what you want?”\n“Don’t really matter what we want, does it? Bigger things than our\nfuture to consider. We can strike a spark that’ll set a fire burning. One day,\nthere’ll be a Great Change, Vick. And folk like you and me will get our\nsay.”\n“A Great Change,” she said, trying to sound like she believed it.\n“When this is done, I’ll have to get out of Adua.”\nShe kept silent. Best thing to do when you’ve nothing to say.\n“You should come with me.”\nShe should’ve kept silent on that, too. Instead, she found she’d asked,\n“Where would we go?”\nA grin spread across his face. Seeing it made her smile. Her first in a\nwhile. Hardly felt like her mouth should bend that way.\nThe frame groaned as he reached down beside the bed and came back up\nwith a battered old book. The Life of Dab Sweet by Marin Glanhorm.\n“This again?” asked Vick.\n“Aye, this.” It fell open at an etching across both pages. As though it was\noften opened there. A rider alone, staring out across a sweep of endless\ngrass and endless sky. Sibalt held that drawing at arm’s length as if it was a\nview spread out in front of them, whispered the words like a magic spell.\n“The Far Country, Vick.”"

He flipped the book shut and tossed it back\ndown on the boards. “Guess there comes a time you have to give up on\nwhat you want and make the best of what you’re given.”\nShe rolled over, pressing her back into his belly. They both lay silent,\nwarm under the blankets, while the world went on outside, and the light of\nthe furnaces across the street flickered orange beyond the misty\nwindowpanes.\n“When we strike that spark,” he murmured, voice loud in her ear, “it’ll\nchange everything.”\n“No doubt,” said Vick.\nAnother silence. “It’ll change everything between us.”\n“No doubt,” said Vick, and she slipped her fingers through his and\npressed his hand tight to her chest. “So let’s take what we can get.

Could be one of your\nfather’s men, hanged by Stour Nightfall’s. Could be one of Stour\nNightfall’s, hanged by your father’s. Not much difference now. The dead\nfight for no one.”\nOne of her father’s men? Had Rikke known him, then? How many folk\nshe knew were killed, these last few days? She felt the ache of tears at the\nback of her nose, sniffed it up hard.\n“How much more of this can we take?” And she knew her voice was\ngetting shrill and cracked but couldn’t stop herself.\n“Can I take?” asked Isern. “I was six when my da first sent me to cut\narrows from the dead. I can take as much as there is. Can you take? If you\nfall down and can’t get up, we’ll have riddled out your limit. Until then…”\nShe looked off through the trees, picking at her berry-stained teeth with a\nfingernail. “We can’t sit still. Nor make it up into the hills to my people. So\nwe must find the Union, or your father’s men, and they’re all backing off\ntowards the Whiteflow quick as goats before a wolf. We have to move faster\nthan they are, and the enemy are between us and them, so the further we go,\nthe more dangerous it gets. We’ll be marching for days, still. Weeks, even.”\nWeeks of marching through bog and bramble, dodging bitter enemies,\neating worms and sleeping under hanged men. Rikke felt her shoulders\nslump.\nShe thought of her father’s hall in Uffrith. The faces carved in the rafters\nand the meat dripping gravy into the firepit. The hounds begging with their\nsad eyes and their chins on her knee. The songs sung of high deeds done in\nthe sunny valleys of the past. Her father getting dewy-eyed at every\nmention of Threetrees, and Thunderhead, and Black Dow, even, raising his\ncup when a voice rumbled out the name of the Bloody-Nine.\nShe thought of the Named Men ranged along both sides of the firepit.\nAll smiling at some joke of hers. Some song of hers. That Rikke, she’s a\nfunny one.

She’d said it so often, even she was\ntired of her moaning. Now she rubbed at the torn and stinking fur on her\ncloak and wondered how she could’ve been so hurt by cold words and sharp\nlooks. Seemed foolish and childish and weak. But that’s what growing up\nis, maybe.

She stood with her numb\nhands dangling, and her shoulders shaking, and the tears silently trickled\ndown her face and dripped from her nose and brought the faint taste of salt\nto her waggling lower lip.\nShe felt Isern step close. Put a gentle hand on her shoulder. Take her\nchin, and tip it up, and speak in a softer voice than she’d ever heard her use\nbefore. “D’you know what my da would say, whenever I cried?”\n“No,” warbled Rikke, slobbery with snot.\nWith a sharp and shocking smack, Isern slapped her across the face.\nRikke blinked, jaw hanging open, putting one hand to her burning\ncheek. “What the—”\n“That’s what he would say.” Isern shook her, hard. “And when that is the\nanswer to your tears, you soon learn to stop mewling and attend to what has\nto be done.”\n“Ow,” muttered Rikke, her whole face throbbing.\n“Yes, you’ve had hardships. The sickness and the fits, and the being\nthought mad and blah, blah, blah. But you were also born with all your\nlimbs and a fine set of teeth in your pretty face, the only child of a powerful\nchief, with no mother and a hall full of soft-headed old warriors doting\nupon you.”\n“That’s not bloody fair—”\nShe gasped as Isern slapped her again, even harder, hard enough that salt\nblood joined salt tears on her lips.\n“You are used to twisting the old men around your fingers. But if Black\nCalder gets his hands upon you, he will twist you around his. He will twist\nyou until you are all broken apart and you will have no one but yourself to\nblame. You have been coddled, Rikke. You are soft as pig fat.” And that"

        "text": "you until you are all broken apart and you will have no one but yourself to\nblame. You have been coddled, Rikke. You are soft as pig fat.” And that\nmerciless finger poked Rikke painfully in her tit again. “Lucky for you, I\nam here, and I will pare the fat away and leave the iron which I see beneath\nwell sharpened.” Poke, poke, in the same old bruise. “Lucky for you,\nbecause out here that softness will kill you, and that iron can save you.”\nPoke, poke. “It may be just a needle now, but one day we might make a\ndagger—”\n“You cunt!” screeched Rikke and punched Isern in the mouth. It was a\ndecent punch, snapping her head back and sending specks of spit flying.\nRikke had always reckoned herself weak. More a weeper than a fighter.\nNow a fury she never knew she had boiled up in her. It was a fine, strong\nfeeling. The first flicker of warmth she’d felt in days.\nShe raised her fist again but Isern caught her wrist, caught her hair, too,\nand wrenched her head back, made her squawk as she was pinned against\nthe tree with fearsome strength.\n“There’s that iron!” Isern grinned, showing teeth blood- as well as berry-\nstained. “Perhaps it is a dagger after all. One day, we might forge a sword\nfrom it that strong men will cower at and the moon itself will smile upon.”\nShe let go of Rikke’s hair. “Now, are you warmed up and ready to dance\nwith me westwards?” Her eyes rolled upwards to the dangling body. “Or\nwould you prefer to dance beside our friend?”\nRikke took a long, ragged breath and blew it smoking out into the chill\nair. Then she held up her empty hands, one now painfully throbbing across\nthe knuckles to add to her woes. “I’m all packed.”\nYoung Heroes\n“B\nastards,” breathed Jurand, studying the valley through his eyeglass.\nLeo plucked it from his hand and trained it on the ridge. Through its\nround window, wobbling with his own barely controlled frustration, he\ncould see the Northmen, their spears black pinpricks against the dull sky.\nThey hadn’t moved all morning. Maybe three score of them, thoroughly\nenjoying the sight of Angland’s shameful retreat. Leo thrust the eyeglass at\nWhitewater Jin. “Bastards.”\n“Aye,” agreed Jin in his thick Northern accent, lowering the glass and\nthoughtfully scratching at his beard. “They’re some bastards, all right.”\nGlaward slumped over his saddle bow with a groan. “Who’d have\nthought war could be so bloody boring?”\n“Nine-tenths of war is waiting,” said Jurand. “According to Stolicus.”\nAs though quoting a famous source made it any easier to bear.\n“You’ve two choices in war,” said Barniva, “boredom or terror, and in\nmy experience boredom’s far preferable.”\nLeo was tiring of Barniva’s experience.

All because he’d spent eight months on\ncampaign in Styria, and barely left Lord Marshal Mitterick’s well-guarded\ncommand post the whole time.\n“Not everyone’s as fashionably war-weary as you.” Leo loosened his\nsword in the scabbard for the hundredth time that morning then shoved it\nback. “Some of us want to see some action.”\n“Ritter saw some action.” Barniva rubbed at his scar with a fingertip.\n“That’s all I’ll say.”\nLeo frowned, wishing he had a scar of his own. “If war’s so terrible,\nwhy don’t you take up farming or something?”\n“I tried. I was no good at it.” And Barniva frowned off at the horizon as\nif there were haunting memories beyond.\nJurand caught Leo’s eye and rolled his to the heavens, and Leo had to\nsmother a laugh. They knew each other’s minds so well they hardly even\nneeded words.\n“They still up there?” Antaup reined his horse in beside them, standing\nin his stirrups as Jin handed him the eyeglass.\n“They’re there,” said Leo.\n“Bastards.” Antaup tossed back that loose lock of dark hair that always\nhung across his forehead and right away it flopped down again. He was the\none the girls couldn’t leave alone, slick and quick and well groomed as a\nwinning racehorse, but all of Leo’s friends were fine-looking men in their\nown ways. Jin was fierce as the Bloody-Nine in a fight, but when that\ntoothy grin split his red beard and those blue eyes twinkled, it was like the\nsun coming out. You couldn’t deny Barniva made the brooding veteran act\nwork for him, especially with the scar on his forehead and the white streak\nit had left in his hair. Then Glaward was a slab of good-humoured\nmanliness, with the height, and the shoulders, and the stubble already thick\nan hour after he shaved.\nAs handsome a crowd of young heroes as you could hope to find. What\na painting they’d make! Maybe Leo would get one commissioned. Who’d\nknow an artist? He found himself glancing sideways.\nThe ladies in Ostenhorm might not see it, but Jurand was the best-\nlooking of the pack. They might’ve called his features soft, beside\nGlaward’s cleft chin or Antaup’s sharp cheekbones, but Leo thought of\nthem more as… delicate? Subtle? The slightest bit vulnerable, even? But\nyou’d find no one tougher than Jurand in defence of his friends. The\nexpressiveness he could pack into a glance. The little frown as he thought\nsomething through. The twitch at the corner of his lips as he leaned close to\nsay it. And always something worth hearing. Something nobody else\nwould’ve—\nJurand glanced sideways and Leo looked quickly away, back up towards\nthose Northmen on the ridge.\n“Bastards,” he said, a little hoarse.\n“And all we can do is sit here,” grumbled Antaup, having a little\nrummage to unstick his balls. “Like caged lions.”"

A man has to find something to\nstave off the despair. Who’d have thought war could be so bloody boring?”\nBarniva looked up. “You’ve two choices in—”\n“Finish that sentence and I’ll stab you,” said Leo.\n“Looks like we could all use a boost to morale.” Glaward nodded\ntowards a column of much less fine-looking men slogging along the valley\nbottom, clutching torn coats, tattered cloaks, threadbare blankets, spears\ndrooping on hunched shoulders at every angle but straight.\nLeo could usually rely on some cheering when the common soldiers saw\nhim. A few shouts of, “The Young Lion!” so he could shake a fist and slap a\nback and bellow some nonsense about the king. Now the men struggled past\nin silence with their eyes on the mud, and with no help yet from\nMidderland, even Leo was a lot less inspired by royalty than he used to be.\nIt seemed the days of warrior-kings like Harod the Great and Casamir the\nSteadfast were far in the past, and supplies of patriotic bluster were running\ndangerously short.\n“I’d never argue with your mother on strategy,” grunted Antaup, “but\nconstant retreat is no good for men’s spirits.”\n“Taste o’ victory would soon perk ’em up,” said Whitewater.\n“Perk us up, too.” Glaward nudged his horse closer to Leo, dropping his\nvoice. “Be easy to teach those bastards a lesson.” And he bunched one big,\nveiny fist and punched at the air with it. “Like we did at that farm.”\nLeo fiddled with the pommel of his sword, loosening it in the scabbard\nagain. He could remember every detail of the charge. Ripping wind and\nthundering hooves. The axe-haft jolting in his hand. The fear-stricken faces\nof the enemy. The giddy joy as they broke and ran.\nJurand had that little crease of worry between his brows. “We’ve no idea\nwhat’s behind that ridge.”\nLeo thought of Ritter’s funeral. The words by the grave. The weak-\nchinned wife weeping by the fireside. Men’s lives were in his hands. These\nmen’s lives, who’d ride through fire for him. His friends. His brothers. He\ncouldn’t stand to lose another.\n“Jurand’s right.” He slapped his sword back, forced his hand away from\nthe hilt. “We don’t know what’s behind that ridge. And mother would kill\nme.”\n“Ride up there, you’ll save me the trouble.”\nLeo winced at that odd mix of reassurance and resentment that always\ncame with his mother’s voice, though every time, the reassurance was less\nand the resentment more."

There was just something off about a\nwoman waving a baton around, even if she was in command for now.\n“Those are Black Calder’s men. And Calder is not a warrior, like his son.”\nShe raised one brow at Leo. “Or mine. Calder is a thinker, like me. You see\nthose woods, over to the right? He has horsemen there, waiting for us to\nmake a fool’s mistake.”\nJurand whisked his eyeglass out of Glaward’s fist. “Metal,” he\nmurmured. “In the trees.”\nLeo should’ve been pleased at his own good judgement. Instead he felt\nangry at missing the obvious. “So we just sit here and let them laugh at us?”\n“I wouldn’t want them to miss the show.” His mother nodded towards\nthe straggling column, thrown into even more disarray by a puddle in the\ntrack. “I put our shabbiest men in this valley with orders to march as badly\nas they could.”\n“You did what?”\n“Let them laugh, Leo. Their laughter will leave no widows weeping. We\nhave our best companies out of sight in the valley behind. If they come,\nwe’ll be ready.” She leaned from her saddle to push back his hair. “What’s\nthis?”\n“Nothing,” he said, brushing her hands away from the scab. “I was\ntraining. With Antaup and Barniva.”\n“Finally managed to land one on him,” said Antaup, grinning.\nJurand cleared his throat and Leo’s mother frowned. “Tell me he didn’t\nfight you both at once.”\nAntaup’s famous way with the ladies clearly didn’t include lady\ngovernors. “Well… not as such—”\n“When will you learn you’ll never beat two strong men together?”\n“I saw Bremer dan Gorst do it,” said Leo.\n“That man’s no model for anything,” she snapped. “Think of your father.\nHe was brave, none braver, but between your grandfather’s treason and the\nweakness of Angland when he took charge, he learned to be patient. He\nknew what he was good at. He never had too high an opinion of himself.”\n“You’re saying I do?”\nJurand cleared his throat again and Leo’s mother laughed. “You know I\nlove you, Leo, but yes, painfully so. Still, it’s hardly a surprise you turned\nout hotheaded. You were conceived on a battlefield.”\nLeo caught Glaward and Barniva grinning at each other and felt himself\nblushing. “Do you have to, Mother?”\n“I don’t have to. Honestly, every generation seems to think coupling is\nsome grand new invention never thought of before. How they believe they\ncame into being in the first place is entirely beyond me. High time you\nfound a wife of your own. Someone to keep you out of trouble.”"

Someone to keep you out of trouble.”\n“I thought that was your job,” he grumbled.\n“I have a war to fight.”\n“That’s the problem. You’re not bloody fighting.”\n“Did you never read that Verturio I gave you? Not fighting is what war’s\nall about.” And taking the last word, as ever, she trotted off westwards with\nher retinue following.\nJurand cleared his throat yet again and Leo rounded on him. “Could you\njust bloody cough and get it over with?”\n“Well, the lady governor always makes some very good points. And you\nreally should read Verturio—”\n“She’s only governor until the king confirms me in my father’s place.”\nThree years since the funeral, and Leo was still bloody waiting. He glared\nacross the valley at those bastard Northmen, watching from their ridge.\n“Then I can do things my way.”\n“Mmm.” Jurand had that worried crease between his brows again.\n“Whose side are you on?”\n“The Union side, along with you and your mother.”\nLeo couldn’t help grinning. “Very reasonable, as always.”\nJurand grinned back. “Someone needs to be.”\n“Reasonable men might live longer.” Leo pulled his gloves off and\ntossed them over, left Jurand juggling them as he swung down from his\nsaddle. “But does anyone remember the bastards afterwards?”\nThe drummer boy at the head of the next company had given up playing\naltogether, shambling along with knees knocking against his drum, teeth\nchattering from the cold. He looked up as Leo came close and snatched his\nwhite hands from his armpits, but fumbled his sticks and sent them\ntumbling to the dirt.\nLeo stooped and plucked them up before the boy could bend, gripped\nthem in his teeth while he shrugged off his cloak and offered it out. “I’ll\nswap you.”\n“My lord?” The boy could hardly believe his luck as he wriggled from\nthe strap of his drum and swaddled himself in several dozen marks’ worth\nof best Midderland wool.\nBarniva had hopped down from his horse, smiling for once as he fell\ninto step with the soldiers. Now Glaward and Jurand joined him, too,\nWhitewater Jin shaking his shaggy head but showing that grin as he\nmuscled into the column.\n“I’ll just take the bloody horses back, then, shall I?” called Antaup,\nstruggling to gather the reins.\n“Mine’s a mare!” shouted Glaward. “You’re always saying how much\nthe ladies love you!”\nSome laughter through the column at that. The first in some time, by the\nlook of things. Leo settled the drumsticks in his fingers, just like he used to\nwhen he marched the servants around the lord governor’s residence as a\nboy.\nA leader should share the hardships of his men, his father used to tell\nhim. He’d have a dry tent, a warm fire and a good dinner this evening,\nwhile they’d be lucky to get a blanket and a bowl of soup. But if he could\nput a little spring in their step on the way, it would be something."

But if he could\nput a little spring in their step on the way, it would be something.\nSomething for them, and something for him. Something to show those\nbastards on the hill.\nThat, and Leo had always been the worst man in the world when it came\nto doing nothing.\n“I’ll try to remember how to play,” he called over his shoulder, “if you\nlot can remember how to march!”\n“I’m no genius like Jurand,” called Glaward, turning so he was trotting\nbackwards, “but as I recall, it’s one foot after the other!”\n“We’ll give it a try, my lord!” called a thickset sergeant, the men already\nmoving faster.\nLeo smiled as he started to tap out the rhythm. “That’s all I ask.”\nThe Moment\n“Y\nou asleep?”\n“No,” grunted Clover. Only sort of a lie, since he had in fact just woken\nup. “Shut my eyes, is all.”\n“Why?”\nHe opened one and peered up at the boy. Hard to say which he was, with\nthe sun flickering through the branches. Specially since Clover had\nforgotten their names again. “So I don’t have to see the injury you two are\ndoing to the noble art of swordsmanship.”\n“Doing the best we can,” grumbled the other boy, whichever one he was.\n“That’ll be a comfort to your mothers when you’re killed for not\nattending to my wisdom.” Clover let his hand hover over the basket of\napples, then plucked out one he liked the look of. Nice blush to it. He took a\nbite and sucked out the juice.\n“Tart,” he said, baring his teeth, “but tolerable. Like life, eh, lads? Like\nlife.” They stared at him blankly. He heaved a weary sigh. “Back to it,\nthen.”\nThey shambled unhappily out into the sun and turned to face each other.\n“Yah!” The dark one dashed in, swinging his stick.\n“Urgh!” The blond one parried, stumbling back.\nClack, clack, as the sticks knocked together. Coo, coo, went a cuckoo in\nthe trees behind. Somewhere men were arguing over something, but so far\noff their voices were no more than a comforting burble. Clover wedged one\nhand behind his neck and wriggled back against the tree.\nSometimes, it could feel like life wasn’t so bad.\nThen he gave an unhappy grunt. Then a twitch. Then a grimace.\nProblem was, these students of his were about the most terrible swordsmen\nhe ever saw. The blond one swung, swung, swung, teeth clenched, while the\ndark one snarled and burbled, more running away than defending, both\nalready out of breath.\n“Stop!” He sat up, tossing his half-eaten apple away. “For the dead’s\nsake, stop!”\nThe boys stuttered to a halt, sticks wobbling down.\n“No, lads, no.” Clover shook his head. “Very much no.

Your lives are hanging in the balance!”\n“They’re just sticks,” said the blond one.\nClover rubbed at his temples. “But we’re pretending they’re swords, you\nhalfhead. I’m not a bloody stick teacher, am I?” The dark-haired boy\nopened his mouth and Clover held up a silencing hand. “Don’t answer that.\nJust take some time. Your dinner ain’t getting cold, is it?”\n“You said strike fast.”\n“Aye, once you strike, like lightning! But think before you strike, eh?”\n“Why don’t you come and show us?” asked the dark one.\n“Out there in the sun?” Clover chuckled to himself. “I didn’t become a\nbloody teacher so I could get up and do it my bloody self.”\n“But…” The blond boy shaded his eyes with his hand. If Clover had\nbeen the dark one, he’d have smashed him right then when he wasn’t\nlooking. But the dark boy just stood there picking his nose. No initiative,\nthese little bastards. “Aren’t you going to show us some… what do you call\nit… technique?”\n“Technique.” Clover laughed. “Technique is what we come to last. So\nfar, you two are only just holding the sword by the right end.”\n“It’s a stick,” said the blond one, frowning at his stick. “The ends are the\nsame.”\nClover ignored him. “It’s a mindset I’m trying to teach you. A winning\nway of looking at the world.”\nThe dark boy was so baffled, he looked almost in pain. “It’s about hitting\nhim with a sword, ain’t it?”\nClover took a slow breath in and slowly blew it out. “First of all, it’s\nabout deciding when to, and when not to. In the end… the only thing a man\ncan really do… is pick his moment. Watch for the opening, and recognise it\nwhen it comes, and seize it.” And Clover snatched at a handful o’ nothing\nand shook his fist. “Picking your moment. That’s the secret. You\nunderstand?”\nThe dark boy looked doubtful. “My da always said it was all in the\ngrip.”\n“Aye. Well. If you had no grip, the sword would just drop out of your\nhand.”\nThe boys stared blankly at him again. Clover sighed again.\n“To it once more, lads, and this time pick your moment.”\nClack, clack went the sticks. Tock, tock went a woodpecker in the trees\nbehind. The snap of a stick in the brush and Clover slipped the knife from\nits sheath at his back and held it down behind his arm.\nAnother footstep and Clover reached out, without looking around, and\ntipped the basket of apples towards the newcomer.\n“Apple?” he asked.\nBlack Calder was standing there, rubbing at that little scar on his chin as\nhe watched the two boys swinging away and not picking their moment in\nthe least. “No,” he grunted.\n“Hard day, Chief?”\n“You get to my position, they all are.”"

He was a sour sort these\ndays, given how much life had given him, or how much he’d managed to\nclaw from it, leastways. Time was he’d had a fine sense of humour, but the\nmore men get, the sourer they tend to turn, and Black Calder had almost the\nwhole North. His brother Scale might wear the king’s chain, but everyone\nknew Black Calder made the king’s choices.\n“I meant do get up,” he said.\n“Ah.”\nClover took his time. He considered it a point of principle to always take\nas much time as he could get away with. Then he shook out his aching legs,\nthen slapped the dirt and dried pine needles from the arse of his trousers,\nthen slapped his palms clean, too.\n“There we go,” he said. “I’m up.”\n“Let ring the bells,” said Calder. “This here is Jonas Clover.”\nClover looked around and got quite the shock to see someone had come\nup behind him and was leaning against the tree. A black-haired lad maybe\ntwelve or thirteen years old with a cleft top lip and watchful eyes. He\nlooked Clover up and down, and didn’t say a thing.\n“Used to be called Steepfield,” added Calder, which made Clover\nscratch unhappily at the back of his head. “Maybe you heard of him.”\n“No,” said the lad, looking over at the two fighting boys with his pale\neyes narrowed. “Who’re these?” They’d fallen to wrestling, lurching about\nwith their sticks waggling at the sky.\n“Those…” Clover considered denying any acquaintance with them, but\ndoubted he’d get away with it. “Are my pupils.”\nThe lad considered ’em a moment, then pronounced his solemn\njudgement. “They’re no good.”\n“You’ve an excellent eye. They’re shit. But that’s how you know what a\ntruly great teacher I am. Any fool can get results from the gifted.”\nThe lad considered that. “So where’s the results?”\n“You have to trust they’ll be along. Patience is a warrior’s most\nfearsome weapon. Take it from me. I’ve been in a few fights.”\n“Did you win any?”\nClover snorted. “Oh, I like him, Calder. Did you come down here just to\ntoss my hard-won reputation in the muck?”\n“Not just that,” said Calder. “I need your help.”\n“Thinking of learning some sword-work?”\n“You ask me, swords are best swung by other men.”\n“Then…?”\nCalder took an unhappy, growling breath. “My son.”\n“The Great Wolf?

You’ve always been loyal.”\n“Doubtless. I was loyal to Bethod, then to Glama Golden, then to Cairm\nIronhead, now to you.”\n“Well. You were loyal to them till they put themselves on the losing\nside.”\n“That sounds almost exactly like disloyalty.”\nCalder shrugged. “A man has to bend with the breeze.”\n“If I’ve got one talent, it’s bending with the breeze. You keep the\napples.” And Clover nudged the basket towards the scar-lipped lad with his\nboot. “They make my tummy hurt.”"

You keep the\napples.” And Clover nudged the basket towards the scar-lipped lad with his\nboot. “They make my tummy hurt.”\n“And all my dreams came true,” said Clover, ambling up with his sword\nover one shoulder.\nWonderful turned her head, showing the white scar through the black\nand silver stubble on her scalp, and hacked out a laugh. A laugh without\nmuch joy in it.\n“Look who it is,” she said.\nHe glanced down at himself. “I recognise those boots! Jonas Clover has\narrived and all wrongs shall be set right.” He winked at her but she was not\nmuch charmed. “Must be your lucky day.”\n“I’m fucking due one.” And she slapped her hand in his, and pulled him\nclose by it, and they clapped each other around the back for good measure.\n“You been eating well?” he asked, looking her up and down. “You’re\nlike hugging a bundle of spears.”\n“Always been lean.”\n“Oh, me too.” And he patted his belly. “The body of a hero lies just\nbelow this carefully nurtured layer of fat.”\nShe raised a brow. Clover loved to see things done well, and she’d a hell\nof a brow-raise, did Wonderful. “And what could possibly drag your fat this\nclose to the fighting?”\n“Black Calder. He tells me you need help.”\n“That I’ll not deny. When does it get here?”\n“You dare trifle with me, woman? I’m supposed to mind the future of\nthe North, the king-in-waiting, the Great Wolf, Stour Nightfall.”\nBoth her brows went up now. “You?”\n“I’m to keep him on the right path. Calder’s words.”\n“Good luck with that.” She beckoned him close and lowered her voice.\n“Not sure I ever met a bigger prick than that boy, and I stood second to\nBlack Dow.”\nClover snorted. “For a day you did.”\n“A day was plenty.”\n“I do hear tell the Great Wolf can be somewhat prickish.”\nWonderful jerked her head towards a column of smoke rising above the\ntrees. “He’s even now burning a village we just captured over yonder. He\nwas going house to house when I left him. Making sure the flames got the\nlot.”\nClover thought he’d caught that old burning-building whiff on the\nbreeze. “Why fight for something if all you do is burn it?”\n“Maybe the Great Wolf could tell you. For damn sure I can’t.”\n“Well.” Clover pushed his chin forward and scratched at the stubble on\nhis stretched-out neck. “Luckily, I’m a man of heroic patience.”\n“You’ll need to be.” Wonderful nodded sideways. “Here comes the\nfuture.”\nAnd Stour came swaggering down the track. He’d been given the name\nNightfall as a babe, on account of being born during an eclipse. It had been\nan hour before, in fact, but no one dared say so now. All part of the ever-\ninflating legend of the Great Wolf.

        "text": "buckled and riveted with gold, and these grey-blue eyes that looked always\na little wet, as if he was about to cry. Tears of acid contempt, maybe, for the\nworld and everything in it.\nHe was no giant, but there was a quick strength to the way he moved. A\ndancer’s grace. And sneering confidence in crazed abundance. A surfeit of\nself-belief can get you killed, but Clover had seen it carry men through fire\nbefore as well. The old iron skin of arrogance. Here was a fellow who knew\nhow to pick his moment, and to cut what he wanted from it with no\nhesitation and even less regret.\nHe had that crowd of cunts with him that famous fighters tend to gather,\nmany of them proudly sporting the sign of the wolf on their shields. Men\nwith no name of their own, drawn to the big name like moths to a bonfire.\nClover had seen the wretched pattern a dozen times before. Glama Golden\nhad a crew very similar, and the Bloody-Nine, too, and more than likely\nSkarling Hoodless had a glowering gaggle however many hundred years\nbefore.\nTimes change, but that crowd of cunts stays much the same.\nStour Nightfall fixed Clover with that wet, cold, hollow stare, quick\nhand sitting loose on the pommel of his sword, and his grin was full of good\nteeth and bad threats.\n“Jonas Clover,” he said. “What the fuck are you doing here?”\n“Your father sent me. Black Calder.”\n“I know who my father is.”\n“He knows who his father is,” sneered one of the sneerers. A heavy-\nmuscled young bastard with a whole armoury strapped about him, made a\nsound on the move like a knife-seller carting too much stock.\nStour scowled sideways. “Shut your mouth, Magweer.” Magweer\nbristled to be slapped down, a wearisome pattern of manly goings-on in\nwhich Clover, to his shame, had once been a keen participant. “What I want\nto know is—why did he send you?”\n“To keep you on the right path.” Clover gave a helpless little shrug. “His\nwords, you understand.”\n“And you can tell the right path from a midden, can you?”\nStour’s wolf-shield arse-lickers chuckled like that was some high wit,\nand Clover smiled along with ’em. If all a man can do is pick his moment,\nthen this was no moment for pride. “I make no grand claims for myself, but\nI’ve chosen a few wrong paths down the years. Could be I can spare you\nfrom stepping in some of the turds that’ve made my boots so fragrant.”\n“I thought I could smell dung.” And Stour sniffed, and licked his teeth,\nand wiped at his nose with a thumbtip. “So what’d be your first advice?”\n“Never scratch your eyebrows with a sword.” Clover grinned. No one\nelse did, but that was their lookout. “Best to just leave ’em in the scabbard\nwhenever possible, I’d say. Drawn swords are bloody dangerous, that’s a\nfact.”\nStour stepped a little closer and brought a little bubble of menace with\nhim. “Wisdom fit for a hero,” he whispered."

I know what I am, and I’m one of life’s followers.”\nThe king-in-waiting opened his wet eyes wide. “Try to keep up, then,\nold man.” And he brushed past, eyes fixed on his next conquest, and Clover\nstepped out of the way of his scowling companions, bowing low. “I want to\nburn us another village or two before sundown!” the Great Wolf called over\nhis shoulder, and the young glories competed with each other to laugh the\nloudest.\n“What did I say?” Wonderful leaned close. “Absolute prick.”\nBreak What They Love\nR\nikke wriggled her shoulders further back among the knotted roots, up to\nher neck in the icy river and her hair full of dirt, listening to the warriors of\nher enemy trudge past on the path above. By the sound of it, there were a\nlot of the bastards. She wondered, yet again, what would happen if they\ncaught her. When they caught her. She tried to make her breath come slow,\ncome even, come quiet.\nWhat with the grinding fear for herself, and the chafing worry for\neveryone she knew, and the niggling pain of a hundred little knocks and\nscratches, and the gnawing hunger and gripping cold, it all added up to\nquite the shittest afternoon she’d ever had, and that with some recent savage\ncompetition.\nShe felt a fingertip under her jaw, pushing her mouth closed, and\nrealised her teeth had started chattering. Isern was pressed against the bank\nbeside her, river to her sharp chin and hair plastered to her frowning face,\nstill as the earth, patient as the trees, hard as the stones. Her eyes rolled up\nfrom Rikke’s to the root-riddled overhang above, and she quietly slipped\none finger from the water and over her scarred lips for quiet.\n“Shit,” came a voice, so loud it seemed in Rikke’s ear, and she startled,\nmight’ve splashed from the bank on an instinct if Isern’s hand hadn’t\nclamped tight about her numb arm under the water.\n“Shit… and…” A man’s voice, getting on in years but soft and slow, like\nhe was in no hurry. “There we go.” A satisfied grunt, and a stream of faintly\nsteaming piss came spattering into the water not a stride from Rikke’s face.\nSad thing was, she was tempted to stick her head under it just for the\nwarmth.\n“There’s all kinds of pleasures in life,” came the voice, “but I’ve come\nto think there’s little better than a piss when you really need one.”\n“Huh.” A woman’s voice this time, picking each word careful as a smith\npicks the nails for a rich man’s horseshoes. “Not sure whether I’ve more\nrespect for you or less following that little revelation.”"

How goes the noble clash of arms?”\n“Union are pulling back as fast as they can. Some skirmishes but there’s\nno real fight in ’em. No sign o’ the Dogman’s boys. Running, I reckon.”\n“Suits me well enough,” said the man. “Any luck, they’ll run all the way\nback to Angland and we can all have a lie down.”\nRikke glanced over at Isern. She’d been right. She always was bloody\nright, specially when it came to disheartening predictions.\nThat morning they’d come upon a clearing full of corpses. A dozen or\nmore. Men from both sides, all on the same side now. They say the Great\nLeveller settles all differences. Rikke had stared at those bodies, her wrist\nagainst her mouth, her breath crawling. Then she’d seen Isern, squatting\nover the dead like a corpse-eater from the songs, plucking at torn clothes,\nfiddling with buckles.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Looking for anything we can eat.”\nAnd Rikke had set to searching herself. Trying not to look at their faces\nas she rooted through pockets with numb fingers. Isern had been right about\nthat, too. Your fear, your guilt, your disgust, they all vanish once you get\nhungry enough. The thing that really upset her as they crept away from the\ndead was that they hadn’t found anything.\n“Chief!” someone roared up on the road. “Nightfall! The king-in-\nwaiting!” And there was an approving clatter of weapons on shields.\nRikke stiffened under the water. Stiffened far as she could given she was\nnear enough a block of ice already, and Isern pressed against her and\nwhispered, hardly more’n a breath, “Shhhhhhhh…”\n“By the dead,” she heard the woman mutter above, and then, with forced\ngood cheer, “Chief! How’s the day?”\n“Bloodless so far, but it’s still early.” The voice of Stour Nightfall\nhimself, then. A whining sort of voice for a famous warrior. Sounded like a\nboy on the edge of a tantrum. “They’re thin sauce, these Southerners,\nalways trickling away. The Bloody-Nine had Rudd Threetrees to fight, and\nBlack Dow, and Harding Grim and all the rest. How’s a man meant to win a\ngreat name without great enemies to weigh it against?”\nA brief pause. “It’s a tester, all right,” said the woman.\n“I’ve a task for you, Wonderful. There’s a girl out in these woods.”\nRikke had a bad feeling in her stomach. Worse than the hunger, and she\nshrank against the bank like she could become one with the dirt. “I want\nher.”\nA snorting chuckle from the enthusiastic pisser. “Well, who wouldn’t\nwant a girl out in the woods?” There was a silence, like the jest had"

Certainly Rikke wasn’t fucking laughing. “How do we tell this\ngirl from another?”\n“They say she’s got a twitchy way. She’ll have a gold ring through her\nnose, maybe a cross painted over her eye.”\nRikke touched the tip of her tongue to the ring through her nose and\nwhispered, “Fuck.”\n“She might have some witch of a hillwoman with her. That you can kill.\nBut the girl we need alive.”\n“Must be important,” said the woman called Wonderful.\nNightfall gave a little hooting giggle. “Well, there’s the thing. She’s the\nDogman’s daughter.”\n“Double fuck,” mouthed Rikke.\n“Shhhhhhh,” hissed Isern.\n“What happens if we catch her?”\nAn unhappy grunt. “Well, if my father gets her, I daresay he’ll ransom\nher back, dangle her as bait, use her to get his way when it comes to talking\npeace.” And Nightfall spat out the word like it tasted bad. “You know my\nfather. Plans within plans.”\n“Always been clever, Black Calder,” came the man’s voice.\n“I see things different. How I see it, the way you break your enemy is\nyou break what they love. Way I hear it, those old fools on the other side\nlove that twitching bitch. Sort of a little mascot for ’em.” Rikke heard the\nsmile in his voice. “So if I get hold of her, I’ll strip her, and whip her, and\npull her teeth out, and maybe get some Thralls to fuck her, out between the\nlines where everyone can hear her squealing.” Bit of a silence, and Rikke\nheard her own breath coming ragged, and Isern’s hand tightening around\nher arm. “Or maybe I’d get my horse to fuck her. Or my dogs. Or… like, a\npig, maybe?”\nThe older man sounded more than a touch disgusted. “How the hell\nwould you do that?”\n“There’s naught you can’t do if you’ve the imagination and the patience.\nThen I’ll bind her up in the trees with brambles where everyone can see,\nand cut the bloody cross in her, and put a bucket underneath to catch her\nguts, and send ’em to the other side.”\n“What, her guts?”\n“Aye, in a pretty box. Hardwood, nicely carved. With flowers, maybe.\nOr no! Herbs. So those old fools won’t smell what they’re getting till they\nopen it.” And he gave a satisfied grunt, like he was talking about a nice fish\nhe’d catch, or a nice meal he’d eat, or a nice sit on the porch he couldn’t\nwait to have at sunset. “Imagine the looks on their faces.” And he chuckled\nlike her guts in a box would be quite the height of drollery.\n“Fuck,” breathed Rikke.\nIsern just whispered, “Shhhhhhhhh…”\n“But that’s for later.” And Nightfall gave a disappointed sigh. “Can’t\ncook what you haven’t caught, can you?

Whoever brings her in’ll be a wealthy man.”\nThe woman called Wonderful sounded like she was hardly enjoying this\nany more than Rikke was. “Right y’are, Chief. We’ll be looking.”\n“Lovely. You can get back to your pissing now, Clover.”\n“That’s all right. Won’t need another for a while, I reckon.”\nRikke heard soft footfalls moving away. Perhaps she should’ve been\nfrozen with fear. The dead knew she’d a right to be. But what she felt\ninstead was a boiling fury. A fury that warmed her through despite the icy\nwater frothing to her chin. A fury that tempted her to slip from the stream\nwith her knife between her teeth and cut the bloody cross in Stour Nightfall\nright then and there.\nRikke’s father had always told her vengeance was a waste of effort. That\nletting it go was the strong thing, the wise thing, the right thing. That blood\nonly led to more blood. But his lessons seemed far away now, meant for a\nwarmer place. She clenched her jaw, and narrowed her eyes, and swore to\nherself that if she lived out the week, she’d make it her business to see\nStour Nightfall fucked by a pig.\n“I’ll be honest, Wonderful,” came the man’s voice, the one called\nClover, speaking soft like he was sharing a secret, “I’m finding that bastard\nincreasingly troubling.”\n“Aye, I know.”\n“Took it for an act at first, but I’m starting to think he’s everything he\npretends to be.”\n“Aye, I know.”\n“Guts in a box? With herbs?”\n“Aye, I know.”\n“He’ll be king one o’ these days, will guts-in-a-box over yonder. King o’\nthe Northmen. Him.”\nA long pause, then a weary grunt. “It’s a thing no right-thinking person\ncould look forward to.”\nRikke could only agree. She thought she saw a hint of their reflections,\ndancing among the black branches in the water.\n“You see something down there?”\nShe stiffened, numb fingers curling tight around the grip of her knife.\nShe saw the jaw muscles clench on the side of Isern’s face, blade of her\nspear sliding from the water, smeared with pitch so it wouldn’t catch the\nlight.\n“What? Fish?”\n“Aye. Worth getting my rod, d’you think?”\nThe sound of Wonderful hawking up, then a glob of phlegm came\nspinning over from above and plopped into the water. “Nothing in this\nstream worth catching, I reckon.”\nIt Was Bad\nT\nhe sun was setting when he came home, just a pink glimmer over black\nhills.

But all so strange.\nAfter two years away, you’d think a man would run headlong towards a\nplace he loved, the people he loved, with the biggest smile his cheeks could\nhold. But Broad trudged slow as the condemned to the scaffold, and smiled\nabout as much, too. The man who left had feared nothing. The one coming\nback was scared all the time. He hardly even knew what of. Himself,\nmaybe.\nWhen he saw the house, huddled among those bare trees, lamplight\nshowing around the shutters, he had this strange urge to walk on. This\nstrange thought he didn’t belong there any more. Not with what he’d seen.\nNot with what he’d done. What if he trod it in with him?\nBut the path leading past was a coward’s path. He clenched his aching\nfists. Gunnar Broad was no coward. Ask anyone.\nTook all the courage he had to knock on that door, though. More than it\nhad to climb the ladders at Borletta, or lead the charge into those pikes at\nMusselia, or even carry those men dying of the grip in the long winter after.\nBut he knocked.\n“Who is it?” Her voice, beyond the door, and it made him wince worse\nthan the points of those pikes had. Till that moment, he’d been afraid she\nwouldn’t be there. That she’d have moved on. Forgotten him. Or maybe\nhe’d been hoping she would’ve.\nHe could hardly find any voice at all. “It’s me, Liddy. It’s Gunnar.”\nThe door rattled open, and there she stood. She’d changed. Not near as\nmuch as he had, but she’d changed. Leaner, maybe. Harder, maybe. But\nwhen she smiled, it still lit the gloomy world, the way it always had.\n“What are you doing knocking at your own door, you big fool?”\nAnd he just started crying. A jolting sob first that came all the way from\nhis stomach. Then there was no stopping it. He fumbled his eye-lenses off\nwith a trembling hand and all the tears he hadn’t shed in Styria, on account\nof Gunnar Broad being no coward, came burning down his crushed-up face.\nLiddy stepped forward and he shrank away, hunched and hurting, arms\nup as if to fend her off. Like she was made of glass and might shatter in his\nhands. She caught him even so. Thin arms, but a hold he couldn’t break,\nand though she was a head shorter than him, she held his face against her\nchest, and kissed his head, and whispered, “Shhhh, now. Shhhhh.”\nAfter a while, when his sobs started to calm, she put her hands on his\ncheeks and lifted his head so she was looking straight up at him, calm and\nserious.\n“It was bad, then, was it?” she asked him.\n“Aye,” he croaked out. “It was bad.”\nShe smiled. That smile that lit up the world. Close enough that even\nwithout his lenses he could actually see it. “But you’re home now.”\n“Aye. I’m home now.” And he set to crying again.\nThe thunk of the axe made Broad flinch. He told himself it was the sound of"

He told himself he was home, safe, far from the\nbattlefield. But maybe he’d brought the battlefield home with him. Maybe\nthe battlefield was whatever dirt he stood on now. He tried to hide it under a\njoke.\n“I still say chopping wood is man’s work.”\nMay set another log on the block and hefted the axe. “When the men sod\noff to Styria, it all becomes women’s work.”\nWhen he left, she’d been boyish, quiet, awkward. As if her skin didn’t fit\nher. She was bony still, but there was a quick strength in the way she\nmoved. She’d grown up fast. She’d had to. Another thunk and two more\nneat pieces of wood went tumbling.\n“I should’ve stayed here and sent you off to fight,” said Broad. “Maybe\nwe’d have won.”\nMay smiled at him, and he smiled that he could make her smile, and\nwondered that someone who’d done all the bad he’d done could’ve had a\nhand in making something as good as she was.\n“Where’d you get the lenses?” she asked.\nBroad touched a finger to them. Sometimes forgot they were even on his\nface, till he took ’em off and everything beyond arm’s reach became a\nsmudge. “I saved a man. Lord Marshal Mitterick.”\n“Sounds fancy.”\n“Commander o’ the army, no less. There was an ambush, and I happened\nto be there, and, well…” He realised he’d bunched his fists trembling tight\nagain and forced them open. “He thought I’d saved him. But I had to admit\nI’d no clue who he was till after the business was done, since I couldn’t see\nfurther than five strides. So he got me these as a gift.” He took the lenses\noff, and breathed on them, and wiped them carefully with the hem of his\nshirt. “Probably cost six months of a soldier’s pay. Miracle o’ the modern\nage.” And he hooked them back over his ears, and into the familiar groove\nacross the bridge of his nose. “But I’m grateful, ’cause now I can appreciate\nmy daughter’s beauty even halfway across the yard.”\n“Beauty.” And she gave a scornful snort but looked just a bit pleased at\nthe same time. The sun broke through and was warm on Broad’s smile, and\nfor a moment it was like it had been before. As if he never went.\n“So you fought, then?”\nBroad’s mouth felt dry of a sudden. “I fought.”\n“What was it like?”\n“Well…” All that time spent dreaming of her face and now she was\nlooking right at him, it was hard to meet her eye. “It was bad.”\n“I tell everyone my father’s a hero.”\nBroad winced. The clouds shifted and cast the yard into shadow, and the\ndread was at his shoulder again. “Don’t tell ’em that.”\n“What should I tell ’em?”\nHe frowned down at his aching hands, rubbed at one with the other.\n“Not that.”\n“What do the marks mean?”\nBroad tried to twitch his shirt cuff down over the Ladderman’s tattoo,"

Where May couldn’t\nsee it. Where he didn’t have to.\n“But—”\n“Enough questions,” said Liddy, stepping out onto the porch. “Your\nfather just got back.”\n“And I’ve got plenty to do,” he said, standing. They must’ve been\nworking hard to keep the house presentable, but it was too much for three,\nlet alone two, looked like it was crumbling back into the land. “Must be half\na dozen leaks to mend.”\n“Be careful. Put your weight on the roof, I’ve a feeling the whole house\nmight fall down.”\n“Wouldn’t be surprised. I’ll check on our flock first, though. I hear the\nprice for wool’s never better, what with all these new mills. They up the\nvalley?”\nMay blinked over at her mother, and Liddy gave an odd kind of grimace,\nand Broad felt that dread pressing on him all the heavier. “What is it?”\n“We don’t have a flock no more, Gunnar.”\n“What?”\n“I wanted to give you a proper night’s sleep without having to worry.”\nLiddy heaved up a sigh seemed to come right from her worn shoes. “Lord\nIsher fenced the valley in. Said we couldn’t graze there any more.”\nBroad hardly understood what she was saying. “The valley’s common\nland. Always has been.”\n“Not any more. King’s edict. It’s happening all over. Next valley, too.\nWe had to sell the flock to him.”\n“We had to sell him our sheep so he could graze ’em on our land?”\n“He gave us a good price. Some lords didn’t give their tenants that\nmuch.”\n“So I get fucked when I go to war and I get fucked when I come back?”\nhe snarled. The voice hardly sounded like his. “You didn’t…do anything?”\nLiddy’s eyes were hard. “I couldn’t think of anything to do. Maybe you\ncould’ve, but you weren’t here.”\n“None o’ this works without a flock!” His father had raised sheep, and\nhis grandfather, and his grandfather’s grandfather. Felt like the whole world\nhad come unravelled. “What’ll we do?” He found he’d clenched his fists\nagain. He was shouting but he couldn’t stop. “What’ll we do?”\nAnd he saw May’s lip trembling like she was about to cry, and Liddy put\nan arm around her, and all the anger drained out of him and left him cold\nand desperate.\n“I’m sorry.” He’d sworn never to lose his temper again. Sworn he’d live\nfor the two of them, give them a good life, and he’d fucked it up a few\nhours through the door. “I’m sorry.” He took a step towards them, lifting a\nhand, then saw the tattoos on the knuckles and jerked it back.\nLiddy spoke soft and steady, looking him in the eye. “We’ve no choice,\nGunnar.

In the new mills.”\nBroad could only stare at her. And in the silence, he heard the sound of\nhorses, and turned towards the track.\nThere were three men coming up it. Coming slow, like they had all day\nto get there. One on a big chestnut. Two on a wagon with a creaky wheel.\nGunnar recognised the driver. Lennart Seldom, the miller’s younger brother.\nBroad had always reckoned him a coward and there was nothing in his\nshifty squint now to change his opinion.\n“It’s Lennart Seldom,” he muttered.\n“It is,” said Liddy. “May, get inside.”\n“But Ma—”\n“Inside.”\nThe other two, Broad didn’t know. A long, lean one sat by Seldom,\nswaying with the jolting of the cart, a big flatbow across his knees. Wasn’t\nloaded, which was a good thing, as they’d a habit of going off at the worst\ntimes, but Broad couldn’t see any reason for him to have it even so. A\nweapon for killing men. Or at least for threatening to.\nHe liked the look of the last rider even less. Big and bearded, with a\nfancy cavalry sword hanging low at his side, and a fancy three-cornered hat\non his head, and a fancy way of sitting his saddle and looking around like\nthis was his land.\nHe reined his horse in closer to the house than was polite, twisted his hat\noff, scrubbing at his flattened hair with his nails, considering Broad in\nthoughtful silence. Seldom brought the wagon to a halt behind him,\nbetween the two big lichen-spattered gateposts Gunnar’s grandfather had\ncarved on the boundary.\n“Gunnar,” he said, shifty eyes flicking to Liddy and back.\n“Seldom.”\nLiddy tidied a stray strand of hair behind her ear, and the wind took it\nright away and set it flicking about her worried face again.\n“You’re back, then.” If Seldom was trying to sound happy about it, he\nfell well short. “Where’d you get the lenses?”\n“In Styria.”\n“How was it?”\n“Bad,” said Broad.\n“Looks like you lost weight.”\nThe one with the flatbow flashed a crooked grin. “How big did he use to\nbe?”\n“Even bigger,” said the bearded one, barely giving Broad a glance as he\nsettled his hat back on. “Evidently.”\n“Too little food and too much shitting, I guess,” said Broad.\n“The soldier’s curse,” said the bearded one. “Name’s Marsh.” He bit the\nwords off short like he didn’t care for talking and wanted to spend as little\ntime at it as he could.\n“I’m Able,” said the thin one. “We work for Lord Isher.”\n“What kind of work?” asked Broad, though it was plain from the\nweapons.\n“This and that. Buying up property, mostly. This is Isher’s valley—”\n“This bit of it ain’t,” said Broad.\nMarsh gave an unhappy grunt, stretched his chin forward to scratch at"

This is Isher’s valley—”\n“This bit of it ain’t,” said Broad.\nMarsh gave an unhappy grunt, stretched his chin forward to scratch at\nhis beard.\n“You can’t make a living here, Gunnar.” Seldom gave a wheedling little\nchuckle. “You know that. Not now there’s no grazing. To be fair to Isher,\nthe king’s hiked up his taxes neck high to pay for his bloody wars. There’s\nland getting fenced in all over. Worked with machines.”\n“Efficiency,” grunted Marsh, not even looking round.\nHis not caring a shit made Broad care all the more. “My father died on\nthis land,” he said, struggling to keep his voice down. “Fighting the\nGurkish.”\n“I know. Mine, too.” Seldom shrugged. “But what can I do?”\n“You just do what you’re told, eh?”\n“If I don’t, someone else will.”\n“Progress,” grunted Marsh.\n“Is it?” Broad frowned up the valley, towards the other houses, all sitting\nquiet. He’d thought it was strange, that there was no smoke from the\nchimneys. “Turned all these others out already, did you? Lant and his\ndaughters, and the Barrows, and Old Neiman?”\n“Neiman died, but the rest sold up.”\n“We made ’em see the sense in it,” said Able, shifting that flatbow in his\nlap.\n“So why’s my wife still here?”\nSeldom sneaked another shifty glance at Liddy. “Just wanted to give her\nsome more time, ’cause we all know each other and—”\n“You always liked her. I understand. I like her myself. That’s why I\nmarried her.”\nLiddy had a worried, warning note in her voice. “Gunnar—”\n“Why she married me, I couldn’t say. But she did.”\nSeldom gave a watery effort at a smile. “Look, friend—”\n“I wasn’t your friend before I left.” Felt suddenly like it was someone\nelse speaking, and Broad was just watching. “I’m even less your friend\nnow.”\n“That’s enough.” Marsh nudged his horse forward with his heels.\nNudged her between Broad and the chopping block, where the axe was. A\ngood horseman. He sat high on his saddle with the sky bright behind so\nBroad had to squint up at him. “Lord Isher’s going to have his valley one\nway or another. No point being stubborn. Better for you to leave with a little\nmoney in your pocket.”\n“Better than what?”\nMarsh took a heavy breath through his nose. “Be a shame if this lovely\nhouse o’ yours were to catch fire one night.”\nHis hand crept down. Not towards the peeling gilt basketwork of that\nfancy sword. To a knife, most likely. Thought he’d goad Broad into\nrashness, then he could just lean over and stab him, cut through a problem\nwith one bit of sharp metal that a lot of talk couldn’t seem to unravel.\nMaybe that’d worked for him before. Worked a lot of times.\n“Catch fire, you say?” Funny thing was, Broad didn’t feel angry. Such a\nrelief to be able to let go, even for a moment, that he almost smiled."

Such a\nrelief to be able to let go, even for a moment, that he almost smiled.\n“That’s right.” Marsh leaned down towards him. “Be a shame… if your\nlovely wife and daughter was—”\nBroad caught his boot and flung him out of his saddle. Marsh gave a\nshocked grunt, flailed at the air as he went tumbling down.\nHe was snarling curses as Broad walked around the horse, trying to\nscramble up, but he had one foot still snarled in the stirrup.\nBroad caught his wrist before he could right himself and twisted it up,\nforced his head down onto the chopping block. Marsh screamed as his\nelbow popped apart, knife dropping in the dirt, but only till Broad lifted one\nboot and smashed his face into the scarred wood with all his weight, bone\ncrunching one, two, three times.\nAble half-stood from the wagon’s seat, eyes starting, fumbling with the\nstring of his bow. Most men need time to act. Broad had the opposite\nproblem. He was always loaded. Always.\nAble had no time to draw the string as Broad strode to the wagon. No\ntime to reach for a bolt, even.\nHe managed to swing the bow but Broad brushed it away with his\nforearm, caught Able by the front of his jacket. He gave a little hoot as\nBroad jerked him into the air and rammed him head first into the old\ngatepost, blood speckling the side of the wagon. He flopped down with one\narm wedged through that creaky wheel, smashed skull bent all the way\nbackwards.\nBroad hopped up onto the seat while Seldom stared, reins still in his\nlimp hands.\n“Gunnar—” He tried to get up but Broad shoved him back down with\nhis knee.\nWasn’t sure how many times he hit him, fist up and fist down, fist up and\nfist down, but when he stopped, Seldom’s face was just a mess of glistening\nred.\nBroad blinked down at him, a bit out of breath. Wind blew up cold on\nhis sweaty forehead.\nBroad blinked over at Liddy. She was staring, hand clapped over her\nmouth.\nBroad blinked at his fists. Took a painful effort to uncurl the red fingers,\nand he started to realise what had happened.\nHe sat down beside Seldom’s corpse on the wagon’s seat, all weak and\nshaky. Spots on his vision. Blood, he realised, on his lenses. He fumbled\nthem off, turned the world to a smear.\nLiddy didn’t say anything. Neither did he.\nWhat was there to say?\nA Sea of Business\n“W\nelcome, one and all, to this thirteenth biannual meeting of Adua’s\nSolar Society!”\nHonrig Curnsbick, the great machinist, resplendent in a waistcoat\nembroidered with golden leaves, threw up his broad hands. The applause\nwas the most enthusiastic this theatre could have heard since Iosiv Lestek\ngave his final performance on its stage.\n“With thanks to our distinguished patrons—the Lady Ardee, and her\ndaughter Lady Savine dan Glokta!” Curnsbick gestured towards Savine’s"

There were whoops, and calls of, “Hear, hear.” From\nmembers who particularly wanted her money, she imagined.\n“We never dreamed, when nine of us first met in Lady Savine’s parlour,\nthat only eight years later, the Solar Society would have more than four\nhundred members throughout the Union and beyond!” Curnsbick might not\nhave, but Savine had always dreamed big. “We are living in bold new\ntimes! Times when only the lazy need be poor. When only the small-minded\nneed be dissatisfied. Times when the world can be changed by the ingenuity\nand endeavour of a single man!” Or even, Fates help us, a single woman.\n“Only yesterday, here in Adua, Dietam dan Kort completed a bridge\nmade entirely of iron—of iron, mark you—that will bring a canal through\nCasamir’s Wall and into the heart of the city.” More applause, and down in\nthe audience, Kort was clapped on the back by his peers. A back covered by\na fine new coat paid for with Savine’s money, as it happened. “With it will\ncome boundless access to raw materials. Will come new industry and new\ncommerce. Will come better jobs and better goods and better lives for the\nmasses.” Curnsbick flung his arms wide with a showman’s flourish, eye-\nlenses flashing. “Will come prosperity for all!” But especially for Savine, it\nhardly needed to be said. What is the point in prosperity, after all, if\neveryone has it?\n“And now to business! The business of progress! Our first address shall\nbe by Kaspar dan Arinhorm, on the application of the Curnsbick Engine to\nthe pumping of water from iron mines.”\nSavine rose to leave while Arinhorm was on his way to the lectern. The\ntruth was she had never been very interested in the inventions. Her\nobsession was how they could be turned into money. And that particular\nalchemy was practised in the foyer.\nA considerable crowd had already gathered beneath the three great\nchandeliers, buzzing with excited chatter, seething with prospects and\nproposals. Knots of soberly dressed gentlemen broke and re-formed, drawn\ninto dizzying swirls and eddies, ladies’ dresses bright dots of colour\nbobbing on the flood. Here and there, one could even spot the fabulous\nrobes of some relic of the old merchant guilds. Savine’s practised eye\npicked out those with money or connections, those without sucked spinning\nafter them like rowing boats in the wake of great ships, desperate for\npatronage, involvement, investment.\nIt was a sea of business. Dangerous waters, swept by unpredictable\nstorms, where fortunes could founder, enterprises be lost with all hands,\nreputations sink beneath the waves, but where a navigator with sufficient\nvision could be borne to spectacular success on the hidden currents of\nwealth and influence.\n“God works for those who work themselves,” murmured Zuri, checking\nher watch.\nShe was ever at Savine’s shoulder, ready to guide the chaff away or, on"

Often at those pleasant interviews,\nshe would make some passing observation about night-time habits, or\nquestionable pasts, or illegitimate offspring, and how this or that scandal\nrevealed might leave a promising career in ruins. There was almost no one\nworth noticing without a secret kept somewhere in her book. A dash of\nblackmail, tastefully administered, could always be relied upon to shift\nprices in the right direction. To win at this game, you had to keep one foot\nin the ballroom and the other knee-deep in the sewer.\n“To work, then.” Savine put on her most radiant smile, snapped out her\nfan and glided down the steps into the melee.\n“Have you considered my proposal? Lady Savine? A new design for\ncoal boats, if you recall? Both keels and colliers! We’ll put coal in every\nhousehold, however humble. Coal is the future!”\n“My surveys show the hills near Rostod are riddled with copper, Lady\nSavine—why, you could scoop it up with your hands! Metals are the\nfuture!”\n“I only need to convince the owner of the land, a relative of Lord Isher,\nand I know you are a close confidante of his sister…”\nSavine might wear a sword, but on this battlefield she fought with a fan.\nA conspiratorial tap with it, closed, could coax out smiles more surely than\na witch’s wand. Snapped open with a flick of the wrist, it cut fruitless\nconversations off more sharply than an executioner’s axe. Deftly raised,\nwith a curl of the lip and a turn of the shoulder, it buried men deeper than a\nspade.\n“Salt is the thing now, Lady Savine. Salt in quantity, for everyone. A\npartner could triple her money, within months, positively quadruple it…”\n“Clocks are the thing! Accurate clocks! Affordable clocks! The\npotential, Lady Savine, you cannot be blind to the potential…”\n“Why, a single word in the right ear at the Patent Office…”\nOne by one, she brought them forward with their schemes, their dreams,\nthe light of certainty bright in their eyes. Her slightest smile lit their faces\nwith delight. Her slightest frown doused them with horror. When she ended\neach interview with a snap of her fan, she thought of all the refusals she had\nendured, and relished her power.\n“With your contacts in Styria, your patronage could make all the\ndifference…”\n“With your friends in the Agriont, it would only take an interview…”\n“The one thing I need is investment!”\n“Quintuple her money!”\n“Lady Savine?” A woman, young, red-wigged, freckle-shouldered, with\na way of peeking over her gaudy fan that was meant to be winsome but to\nSavine looked merely sly. “I am—forgive me—a tremendous admirer of\nyours.”\nSavine had a whole queue of tremendous admirers, and no idea what"

It\nappeared to run in the family.\n“Only my second cousin,” simpered Selest. “I fear I’m nothing but a\ntiny twig at the furthest reaches of the family tree.”\n“A prize bud just blooming, I am sure.”\nSelest blushed in the manner of an innocent country girl out of her depth\nin the big city. It made Savine think of a bad actress in a bad play. “I knew\nyou would be beautiful, but never dreamed you might be so kind. My father\nleft me some money and I intend to invest it. Might I ask whether you have\nany advice?”\n“Buy things that go up in value,” said Savine, turning away.\n“Lady Savine dan Glokta.” A small man with curly hair and clothes that\nadvertised both money and tasteful restraint. “I had been hoping to make\nyour acquaintance.”\n“I believe you have the advantage of me.”\n“Certainly not in beauty.” He was unremarkable, it was true, apart from\nhis bright eyes. They were different colours, one blue, one green. “My name\nis Yoru Sulfur.”\nIt was rare indeed for Savine to hear a name she had not heard before,\nand it always made her curious. New names meant new opportunities, after\nall. “And what is your business, Master Sulfur?”\n“I am a member of the Order of Magi.”\nSavine was not easily surprised, but she could not stop her brows lifting\nat that. Zuri usually shepherded the cranks away, but she seemed for once to\nbe elsewhere. “A wizard at a meeting of investors and inventors? Are you\nscouting the enemy?”\n“Say rather that I am seeking new friends.” His smile was full of clean,\nsharp, shiny teeth. “We magi have always been interested in changing the\nworld.”\n“How admirable,” said Savine, though in her experience, when men\nspoke of changing the world, they always meant to suit their own interests.\n“There was a time, in the days of Euz and his sons, when magic was the\nbest way to do it. But that time is long past. These days…” And Sulfur\nglanced about the heaving foyer and leaned close as if to share a secret. “I\nbegin to think this is better.”\n“You go where the power is,” murmured Savine, touching him gently on\nthe wrist with her fan. “I am just the same.”\n“Oh, you should meet my master. I have a feeling the two of you would\nhave a great deal in common. He is used to dealing with your father, of\ncourse. But no one lasts for ever.”\nSavine frowned. “Whatever can you—”\n“Lady Savine!” Curnsbick was advancing on her, arms spread wide in a\ngesture of great affection. “When the hell are you going to marry me?”\n“A few days after never. Besides, I swear I was at your wedding to\nsomeone else.”"

I couldn’t have that on my\nconscience.”\n“Don’t pretend you have a conscience.”\n“Oh, I have one. But muzzled and kept well away from my business\naffairs. This is…” She turned to introduce Sulfur but he had already\nvanished into the crowd.\n“Curnsbick, you old dog!” It was Arinhorm, the deliverer of the first\naddress, blundering into their conversation like a hog into a rose garden.\n“Arinhorm, my friend!” Curnsbick slapped him heartily on the shoulder.\nHe was a genius where machines were concerned, but prone to give people\nfar too much credit. “Might I introduce Savine dan Glokta?”\n“Ah, yes.” Arinhorm offered her a particularly mirthless smile. One of\nthose insufferable men who thought everyone existed to service his needs.\n“I understand you have invested in several iron mines in Angland. Indeed, I\nunderstand you are perhaps the largest single owner in the entire province.”\nSavine did not like her affairs being discussed before an audience.\nWinning made people friendly. Winning too much made them nervous. “I\nbelieve I have some interests there.”\n“You should have heard my address. The main challenge to the\nefficiency of mines is how quickly water can be pumped from their depths.\nThere are limits to what can be achieved by hand or horse, but with my\nadaptation of Master Curnsbick’s engine, one can pump at ten times the\nspeed and therefore dig further and deeper—”\nThere was sense in what he said, but Savine detested the way he said it.\n“My thanks, but it is not iron that interests me at the moment, but soap.”\n“Pardon me?”\n“Soap, glass, crockery. Things which were once luxuries for the noble\nhave become essentials for the wealthy and will soon be a staple for\neveryone. Clean bodies, and glazed windows, and… crockery. Find a way\nto pump dinnerware out of the ground and I would be delighted to discuss\nit.”\n“You must be joking.”\n“I save my jokes for those with a sense of humour. You understand I\nhave to be careful in my choice of partners.”\n“You are making a mistake.”\n“It would hardly be my first. I struggle on regardless.”\n“One should never allow feelings to get in the way of profit,” he\nsnapped, slightly blotchy with anger about the collar. Zuri had slipped from\nthe crowd now and was doing her best to ease him away but he refused to\nbe moved. “This only strengthens my conviction that there really is no place\nin business for women.”\n“And yet here I am,” said Savine, smiling all the wider. “And here you\nare, with your begging bowl. No doubt there are many parts of Union life in\nwhich there is no place for women.

Goodwill can be the best of\ninvestments—”\nShe dismissed his nonsense with a fond pat of his hand. “Generosity and\ngoodwill sit well on you but they simply do not go with my complexion at\nall. A certain number of bitter enemies are an essential accessory for a lady\nof fashion.”\n“And it may be that he has procured an investor after all.”\n“Damn it.” He was already deep in conversation with Selest dan\nHeugen. “Is she picking through my offcuts?”\n“Do you know, I think she might be.”\n“Like a bitch at the butcher’s bins.”\n“She seems quite popular with the gentlemen of the Society.” Indeed,\none could almost see the grey heads turning as she slipped through the room\non Arinhorm’s arm.\n“Anything with a quim is popular with them,” muttered Savine.\n“Ouch. She reminds me of a younger you.”\n“Younger me was poison.”\n“Younger you was nectar. Almost as much so as older you. But I’ve\nheard it said that imitation is the most honest tribute. We have a whole\ntheatre full of old fools trying to do a Curnsbick, after all. Do I complain?”\n“Whenever you’re not boasting.”\n“I’ve been boasting continuously for so long it hadn’t come up.” And\nCurnsbick gave her the mildest of grins. “The Circle of the World is wide,\nSavine. You can allow someone else to occupy one little plot of it.”\n“I suppose so,” she grudgingly admitted, putting the distasteful union of\nArinhorm and Heugen from her mind. “As long as they’re paying me rent.”\nBut Curnsbick was no longer listening. The eager chatter was falling\nsilent, the crowd parting like soil before the plough. A man strode through\nthe throng, his facial hair meticulously barbered and lavishly waxed, his\ncrimson uniform festooned with gold braid.\n“Bloody hell,” whispered Curnsbick, gripping her wrist, “it’s the bloody\nking!”\nWhatever the criticisms of His Majesty—and there were many, regularly\ncirculated in ever more scurrilous pamphlets—no one could have denied\nthat King Jezal always looked the part. He chuckled, slapped arms, shook\nhands, traded jokes, a beacon of slightly absent good humour. A dozen fully\narmoured Knights of the Body clattered after him, and at least two score\nclerks, officers, servants, attendants and hangers-on after them, chestfuls of\nunearned medals glittering beneath the thousand dancing candle flames\nabove.\n“Master Curnsbick.” His Majesty ushered the great inventor up from his\nknee. “So sorry I’m late.

One of the royal party issued a choked splutter at her\ninsolence, but no risk, no profit.\nCurnsbick held out his hand to present her. “And this is—”\n“Savine dan Glokta, of course,” said the king. “It makes one very proud,\nto see one’s subjects showing such… enterprise and determination.” He\ngave a strange little shake of his fist. So strong a gesture, so weakly\ndelivered. “I’ve always admired people who…make things.”\nSavine sank lower still. She had long ago become used to men staring at\nher. Had learned to tolerate it, to deflect it gracefully, to turn it to her\nadvantage. But the look the king was giving her was not the usual kind.\nThere was something awfully sad behind his blandly handsome grin.\n“Your Majesty is far too kind,” she said.\n“Not kind enough.” She wondered if he had somehow found out about\nher and his son. Had Orso let something slip? “With such young women to\nlead the way, the Union’s future looks bright indeed.”\nFortunately, there was a commotion further down the hall. A knight\nherald pushed through the crowd, winged helmet tucked under one arm.\n“Your Majesty, I have news.”\nThe king looked mildly annoyed. “That’s your job, isn’t it? Could you\nbe more specific?”\n“News… from the North.” He leaned in to whisper, and the king’s fixed\nsmile sagged.\n“My apologies, Lady Savine. My apologies, everyone! I am needed at\nthe Agriont.” The gilt edge of His Majesty’s cloak snapped as he spun on\none highly polished heel, his retinue crowding after like a gaggle of self-\nimportant ducklings behind their mother, not a smile among them.\nCurnsbick puffed out his cheeks. “Do you think we could call ourselves\nendorsed by His Majesty after a visit of half a minute?”\n“A visit’s a visit,” muttered Savine. The chatter was already louder than\never, people flocking towards the doors, jostling one another in their haste\nto be first to learn the news. And to profit by it. “Find out what that knight\nherald had to say,” she murmured to Zuri. “Oh, and make a note—I would\nlike Kaspar dan Arinhorm to have troubles with his business in Angland.”\nZuri slipped her pencil from behind her ear. “Rumours, regulations, or\njust no one answering his letters?”\n“Let’s start with a bit of each and see how we go.”\nSavine had not made society a snakepit.

The Crown Prince of the Union—\n“And Talins, theoretically.”\n“—can be as inconsistent as he damn well pleases.” Orso’s fumbling\nhand closed about the handle of a jug and he lifted it and took a swig,\nrealised too late there was stale ale in it rather than water, and spat it over\nthe wall in a mist.\n“Your Highness will have to be inconsistent while dressing,” said Tunny.\n“There’s news.”\nOrso looked for water, couldn’t see any, and swigged down the dregs of\nthe ale after all. “Don’t tell me that blonde from yesterday was carrying the\ncock-rot.” He tossed the jug rolling across the floor and sagged back into\nbed. “The last thing I need is another dose—”\n“Scale Ironhand and his Northmen have invaded the Protectorate.\nThey’ve burned Uffrith.”\n“Pfft.” Orso thought about grabbing a shoe and throwing it at Tunny but\ndecided he couldn’t be arsed, so he rolled over and cuddled up to that girl,\nwhat’s-her-name, pressing his half-hard cock into the small of her back\nwhere it was warm and making her give a semi-conscious mew of upset.\n“That isn’t funny.”\n“You’re damn right it isn’t. Lady Governor Finree dan Brock is fighting\na brave rearguard action along with the Dogman and her son Leo, the big,\nbold Young Lion, but they’re giving ground before the terror of the\nNorthmen and their fearsome champion Stour Nightfall, the Great Wolf,\nwho’s sworn to drive the damn Southerners out of Angland.” There was a\nbrief silence. “We’re the damn Southerners, in case you’re wondering.”\nOrso managed to get both eyes open at once. “You’re not joking?”\n“You’ll know when I’m joking because Your Highness will be\nlaughing.”\n“What the—” Orso felt a sudden stab of…something. Worry?\nExcitement? Anger? Jealousy? Some feeling, anyway. It was so long since\nhe really had one it was like a spur in his backside. He scrambled out of\nbed, got one foot tangled in the sheet, kicked it free and accidently kicked\nwhat’s-her-name in the back.\n“The hell?” she mumbled as she sat up, trying to claw hair tangled with\nwine out of her face.\n“Sorry!” said Orso. “Terribly sorry, but… Northmen!

Lions\nand wolves and whatever!” He grabbed his little box and took a pinch of\npearl dust up each nostril. Just to blow away the cobwebs. “Someone\nshould bloody do something.” As the burning at the back of his nose faded,\nthat feeling became sharper. So sharp it made him shiver, the hairs on the\nbacks of his arms standing up. You could try doing something to be proud\nof, his mother had said. Might this be his chance? He had scarcely even\nrealised how much he wanted one.\nHe looked from the empty bottles about the bed to Tunny, standing\nagainst the wall with his arms folded. “I should do something! Draw me a\nbath!”\n“Hildi’s already doing it.”\n“Where are my trousers?” Tunny tossed them over and Orso snatched\nthem from the air. “I have to see my father right away! Is it Monday?”\n“Tuesday,” said Tunny as he swaggered from the room. “He’ll be\nfencing.”\n“Then see if you can find my steels as well!” bellowed Orso as the door\nswung shut.\n“For pity’s sake, shut up,” moaned what’s-her-face, pulling the covers\nover her head.\n“One touch a piece!” The king grinned hugely as he offered his hand.\n“Well fought, Your Majesty.” Orso let his father pull him to his feet,\nrubbing at his bruised ribs as he stooped to retrieve his fallen steel. He had\nto admit he was feeling the pace. His padded jacket seemed rather more\npadded than the last time he wore it. Perhaps his mother was right and he\nhad passed the age where he could get away with anything. One sober day a\nweek might be a good idea, from now on. A morning a week, at any rate.\nBut circumstances always conspired to stop him doing the right thing.\nBy then, one of the servants was floating across the perfectly manicured\nlawn with two glasses on his polished tray.\nThe king wedged his long steel under his arm to sweep one up. “A little\nrefreshment?”\n“You know I never drink before lunch,” said Orso.\nThey looked at each other for a moment, then both burst out laughing.\n“You’ve a hell of a sense of humour,” said Orso’s father, raising his glass in\na little toast. “No one could ever deny that.”\n“To the best of my knowledge, they never have. It’s every other good\nquality they accuse me of lacking.” He took a swig, swilled it about his\nmouth and swallowed. “Ah, rich and red and full of sunshine.” Osprian, no\ndoubt, which made him wish, if only briefly, that they’d conquered Styria\nafter all. “I’d forgotten what excellent wine you have.”\n“I’m the king, aren’t I? If my wine’s poor, there’s something seriously\nwrong with the world.”\n“There are several things seriously wrong with the world, Father.”\n“Doubtless! I was visited by a delegation of working men from Keln,\nyou know, just yesterday, with a set of grievances about conditions in the\nmanufacturing districts there.” He frowned across the beautiful palace\ngardens and shook his head in dismay. “Choking vapours on the air,"

Terrible stories—”\n“And Scale Ironhand has invaded the Dogman’s Protectorate.”\nThe king paused, glass halfway to his mouth. “You heard about that?”\n“I’ve been in a whorehouse, not down a well. Adua’s buzzing with the\nnews.”\n“Since when did you care about politics?”\n“I care about a crowd of barbarians burning the cities of our allies,\nspreading blood and murder and threatening to invade the sovereign\nterritory of the Union. I’m the heir to the bloody throne, aren’t I?”\nThe king wiped his lustrous moustaches—grey shot with gold these\ndays, rather than gold shot with grey—and wriggled his fingers back into\nhis glove. “Since when did you care about being heir to the throne?”\n“I’ve always cared,” he lied, tossing the glass rattling back onto the tray\nand making the servant gasp as he weaved about trying to stop it falling.\n“I’ve just… had some trouble expressing it. Ready, old man?”\n“Always, young pup!” The king sprang forward, jabbing. Their long\nsteels feathered together, pinged and scraped. The king stabbed with his\nshort steel but Orso caught it on his own, held it, turned. They broke apart,\ncircling one another, Orso’s eyes on the point of his father’s long steel, but\nflicking occasionally to his leading foot. His Majesty had a habit of twisting\nit before he struck.\n“You’re a fine swordsman, you know,” said the king. “I swear you’ve\nthe talent to win a Contest.”\n“Talent? Possibly. Dedication, stamina, commitment? Never.”\n“You could be a true master if you practised more than once a month.”\n“If I practise once a year, it’s a busy one.” In fact, Orso practised at least\nonce a week, but had his father known, he might have suspected that Orso\nwas letting him win. You wouldn’t have thought the monarch of the most\npowerful nation in the Circle of the World would care about beating his own\nson in the fencing circle, but throwing a touch or two was always the surest\nway for Orso to get what he wanted.\n“So… what are we planning to do about the Northmen?” he asked.\n“We?” The point of his father’s long steel flicked against Orso’s.\n“All right, you.”\n“Me?” And flicked the other way.\n“Your Closed Council, then.”\n“They plan to do precisely nothing.”\n“What?” Orso’s steel drooped. “But Scale Ironhand has invaded our\nProtectorate!”\n“That’s in no doubt.”\n“We’re supposed to be protecting it. Practically by definition!”\n“I understand the principle, boy.” The king lunged and Orso dodged\naside, hacked with his short steel, the clang of their blades making the great\npink wading birds in a nearby fountain look scornfully over. “But principles\nand reality are occasional bedfellows at best.”"

Orso almost said, but thought that might be a little\ntoo much spice for the king’s rather bland tastes in humour. Instead, he\ndodged another lunge and switched to the attack, catching his father’s long\nsteel on his, blade flickering around it and whipping it from his hand.\nHe caught a despairing thrust of the short steel, guards scraping, then the\nblade of his long flexed lightly as he jabbed the king in the shoulder.\n“Two to one,” said Orso, slashing at the air. Wouldn’t do to let the old\nman win too easily. No one ever values what they get without trying, after\nall.\nHe beckoned one of the servants over with a towel while his father\nsnapped his fingers impatiently at another to fetch his fallen sword.\n“There will always be some crisis, Orso, and it will always be the worst\never. Not long ago, we were terrified of the Gurkish, and with good reason.\nHalf of Adua was destroyed driving them out. Now their great Prophet\nKhalul has vanished, their all-powerful Emperor Uthman is deposed, and\ntheir power has drifted apart like smoke on the breeze. Instead of\nconquering armies, it is desperate refugees who spill from the South.”\n“Can’t we take a moment to enjoy the fall of an enemy?”\n“Some of us find little to celebrate in the violent overthrow of a\nmonarch.”\nOrso winced. “I suppose it does strike a little close to home.”\n“All it shows is that great powers can fall as well as rise. Murcatto has\nalmost all of Styria under her heel and the Old Empire grows in strength,\nchallenging our hold on the Far Country and inciting yet more rebellion in\nStarikland. Now the bloody Northmen break our hard-won treaties and\ncome to war again. There’s no end to their appetite for blood up there.”\n“For other people’s blood, maybe.” Orso tossed the towel over the\nservant’s head and found his mark again. “It’s surprising how quickly the\ntoughest men tire of the sight of their own.”\n“True enough. But it’s the enemies inside our borders that cost me sleep.\nThe wars in Styria have left everyone out of pocket and out of patience. The\nOpen Council never stops complaining. If the nobles didn’t hate each other\neven more than me, I swear they’d already be in open rebellion. The\npeasants may have quieter voices but they’re every bit as dissatisfied. I face\ndisloyalty everywhere.”\n“Then we must teach a sharp lesson, Your Majesty.” Orso cut, cut, thrust\nand the king turned the cuts aside, sidestepped the thrust, blundered into a\nbush clipped to look like a storybook magus’s tower and danced back into\nspace. “A lesson delivered to the Northmen, but witnessed by your faithless\nsubjects, too. Show our allies we can be relied upon, and our enemies that\nwe won’t be trifled with. A clutch of victories, a couple of parades and a\ndash of patriotic fervour! The very thing to bring the nation together.”"

You could fill the moat of the Agriont with the money I owe and still\nhave debts left over. There’s nothing I can do.”\n“But you’re the High King of the Union!”\nOrso’s father gave a sad smile. “One day, my son, you’ll understand.\nThe more powerful you are, the less you can really do about anything.”\nThe points of his steels appeared to wilt as he spoke, but it was quite\nclearly a ruse, Orso could tell he was ready by the way he held his back leg.\nStill, the king was so pleased with his trap it would have been rude not to\nblunder into it. Orso dived forward with a bark of triumph, then a highly\nconvincing gurgle of shock at the parry he had known was coming. He\nsuppressed his instinct to block the king’s short steel, let it slip past his\nguard and groaned as it thudded into his training jacket.\n“Two each!” cackled Orso’s father. “Nothing like a bit of self-pity to\nbring the hothead rushing in!”\n“Richly done, Father.”\n“Life in the old dog yet, eh?”\n“Fortunately. I think we can both agree I’m not quite ready to take the\nthrone.”\n“No one ever is, my boy. Why are you so interested in a Northern\nexpedition, anyway?”\nOrso took a deep breath and held his father’s eye. “I want to lead it.”\n“You want to what?”\n“I want to… you know…contribute. To something other than whores’\npurses.”\nHis father gave a snort of laughter. “The last body of soldiers you led\nwas that toy regiment the Governor of Starikland sent you when you were\nfive years old.”\n“Then it’s high time I gained some experience. I’m the heir to the\nthrone, aren’t I?”\n“So your mother tells me, and I try never to disagree with her.”\n“I have to mend my reputation at some point.” Orso stepped to his mark\nfor their deciding touch, hacking a muddy divot out of the perfect lawn with\nhis heel. “Poor thing’s in a wretched state.”\n“Worried this Young Lion will steal all the glory, eh?”\nOrso had heard that name too often for comfort lately. “I daresay he\ncould spare a few shreds for his king-to-be.”\n“But… fighting?” Orso’s father worked his mouth unhappily and the old\nscar through his beard twisted. “The Northmen don’t fool about when it\ncomes to bloodshed. I could tell you some stories about my old friend\nLogen Ninefingers—”\n“You have, Father, a hundred times.”\n“Well, they’re bloody good stories!” The king straightened a moment,\nlowering his steels and giving Orso a quizzical little frown. “You really\nwant this, don’t you?”\n“We have to do something.”\n“I suppose we do, at that.” The king sprang forward but Orso was ready,"

How about this?” Cut, cut,\njab, and Orso retreated, watching. “I’ll give you Gorst, twenty Knights of\nthe Body and a battalion of the King’s Own.”\n“That’s nowhere near enough!” Orso switched to the offensive, almost\ncaught his father with a jab and made him hop back.\n“I agree.” The king paced sideways, point of his long steel describing\nglittering little circles in the air. “The rest you’ll have to find yourself. Show\nme you can raise five thousand more. Then you can rush to the rescue.”\nOrso blinked. Raising five thousand troops sounded worryingly like\nwork. But there was an unfamiliar energy spreading through him at the\nthought of having something meaningful to do.\n“Then I bloody well will!” He’d got all he’d get by losing. He felt like\nwinning for once. “Defend yourself, Your Majesty!”\nAnd steel scraped on steel as he sprang forward.\nFencing with Father\n“J\nab, jab, Savine,” said her father, craning forward from his chair to\nfollow her movements. “Jab, jab.”\nHer shoulder was on fire, the pain spreading down her arm to her\nfingertips, but she forced herself on, struggling to make every jab sharp,\ntight, perfect.\n“Good,” piped Gorst as he turned her efforts away, always balanced,\nalways calm, the sounds of scraping steel echoing about the bare room.\nNothing was ever good enough for her father, though. “Watch your front\nfoot,” he snapped. “Keep your weight spread.”\n“My weight is spread.” And she pumped out three more jabs, lightning-\nquick.\n“Spread it more. I know how much you hate to do anything badly.”\n“Almost as much as you hate to see me do anything badly.”\n“Spread your weight, then. We’ll both be happier.”\nShe widened her stance and let go some more jabs, her steel scraping\nagainst Gorst’s.\n“Better?” asked her father.\nIt clearly was, but they both knew she would never concede defeat by\nadmitting it. “We’ll see. How are things in the North?”\n“A procession of disappointments, like most of life. The Northmen\nadvance, the Anglanders fall back.”\n“People say we can expect no better with a woman leading our troops.”\nSavine lunged, steel clashing as Gorst caught her sword on his own and\nsteered it wide.\n“We both know what utter fools people are.” Her father sneered the\nword as though the very thought of humans disgusted him. “Since the death\nof her father, I daresay Finree dan Brock is the Union’s most competent\ngeneral. You know her, don’t you, Gorst?”\nThe king’s hulking bodyguard, normally beyond expressionless, winced.\n“A little, Your Eminence.”\n“I wish I could have given her the command in Styria,” said Savine’s\nfather. “We might have been counting our victories now, rather than our\ndead.

Then where would we be?\nEnough with the point, let’s see what you can do with the edge. And cut like\nyou mean it, Savine, he’s not made of glass.”\nShe darted at Gorst as if to go right, switched to the left with a savage\ncut at head height. He dropped points and jerked away, fast as a snake in\nspite of his size, eyes focused on the blade as it whistled past his nose.\n“Excellent,” he squeaked.\nShe gave her steels a little flourish. “Can Brock beat the Northmen\nalone?”\n“She’s still gathering her forces in Angland,” said her father, “and she\nhas the Dogman with her, but Scale Ironhand has them well outnumbered.\nMy guess is the Protectorate will be overrun but she’ll hold the Northmen at\nthe Whiteflow. Then, perhaps, circumstances will change here and we can\nswoop in next spring and reap the glory.”\n“The women do the hard work and the men reap the glory. Sounds\nfamiliar.”\n“Petulance is unbecoming in a swordswoman. Cut, girl. Put some blood\ninto it.”\nSavine darted around Gorst, shoes squeaking on the wooden floor,\nslashing away from every angle. For all he scarcely seemed to move, his\nsteels were always in the right place to parry.\n“My daughter has quick feet, eh, Gorst?”\n“Very quick, Your Eminence.”\n“That’ll be your mother’s dancing lessons. Sad to say, I don’t dance\nmuch myself these days.”\n“A shame,” said Savine as she circled, looking for an opening, sweat\ntickling at her stubbled scalp. “I imagine the Closed Council could use\nsome clever footwork. If Brock loses, you’ll look like cowards and fools.”\n“Even bigger cowards and fools than we do already.”\n“If she wins, she’ll gild her own reputation. And her son’s.”\n“Leonault dan Brock.” Her father sneered, showing his empty gums\nagain. “The Young Lion.”\n“Who comes up with these ridiculous names?”\n“Writers, I daresay. I saw lions when I was on campaign in Gurkhul.\nStupid beasts. Especially the males. That’s enough. Break.”\nSavine took a hard breath, pulling her padded tunic open to let some air\nin. She had sweated clean through her shirt. She wondered, as she scrubbed\nher shaved head with a towel, whether the fine gentlemen of the Solar\nSociety would recognise her now, without powder, jewels, dress, wig. More\nthan likely they would smell money through the sweat and swarm around\nher just the same.\n“We could adjust your grip a little.” Her father leaned forwards, bones\nshifting under the pale skin of his hand as he gripped his cane to rise.\n“No, no.” She stepped over to put a gentle hand on his shoulder. “You’re"

By the Fates, he felt thin. It would have been unfair to\ncall him skin and bone. There was scarcely any skin on him.\n“How are you?” she asked.\nHis left eye twitched. “Have you noticed the nation falling?”\n“Not this morning.”\n“Then I suppose I’m still alive today. You might want to check again\ntomorrow, though. I’ve enemies everywhere. In the palace. On the Closed\nCouncil. On the Open Council. In the fields and the factories. The\nAnglanders were furious with me before the war, they’re downright\nincandescent now. I’m hated everywhere.”\n“Not here,” she said. As close to a declaration of affection as she was\never likely to utter.\n“That’s more than enough for me.” He gently touched her face,\nfingertips cold on her sweaty cheek. “And far, far more than I deserve.”\n“I suppose a few enemies are the price of one of the big chairs.”\nHer father gave a snort of disgust, bitter even for him. “The moment\nyour arse hits the wood, you realise what they’re worth. You think the\nClosed Council really rule? Or the king and queen? We’re all no more than\ndancing puppets. There to draw the eye. To take the blame.”\nSavine frowned. “Then who pulls the strings?”\nHer father’s eyes met hers, bright and hard. “I have been asking\nquestions all my life. I learned that some are better left unanswered.” He let\nhis hand drop and clapped it on top of hers. The one that held her steels.\n“Time to work on your defence.”\n“Three strikes?” asked Gorst.\nSavine tossed her short steel up with her right hand and snatched it out\nof the air with her left. “Whatever you say.”\nHe shuffled at her, jabbed and cut with no real venom. It was easy for\nher to block the jabs, to turn the cut away with a showy flick of the wrist.\n“So, if the lady governor fights the Northmen to a stalemate, what does\nit mean for holdings in Angland?”\n“Ah!” Her father grinned. “I was wondering when we’d get to money.”\n“We never left it.” She parried, and again, sidestepped a sluggish lunge.\nFor a man renowned for his ferocity, Gorst was scarcely hitting at all.\n“Prices are tumbling up there. Do I sell out or get deeper in?”\n“The Union will never let go of Angland. If I were a man of business,\nI’d be snapping up the bargains. After all, danger and opportunity—”\n“Often walk hand in hand,” she finished for him, and out of the corner of\nher eye she caught his grin. There were few things that gave her the same\nsatisfaction as making the Arch Lector smile.

Valint and Balk are vermin.\nParasites. Leeches. Once they get stuck to you, there’s no getting free of\nthem. They won’t be satisfied until they own the sun and can charge the\nworld interest for letting it rise every morning. Promise me you’ll never\ntake a bit from the bastards!”\n“I promise. I’ll stay well away.” Though it was not always easy. Like a\ngreedy old willow tree, the twisted roots of that particular banking house\nburrowed into everything. “We’re not talking about much. I already took a\ncontrolling share in the armoury in Ostenhorm at a price you would\nscarcely believe.”\n“Swords are always a good investment,” admitted the Arch Lector as he\nwatched her swat Gorst’s away with her own.\n“I’m told these fire-tubes are the future. These cannons.”\n“We had mixed results with them in Styria.”\n“But they’re getting smaller all the time, more portable and more\npowerful.” She stepped nimbly around a limp jab. “They’ve developed an\nexploding cannon-stone now.”\n“Explosions are always a good investment, too.”\n“Especially if I can arrange a contract or two with the King’s Own.”\n“Oh? Do you know anyone with influence?”\n“As it happens, I have arranged a little soirée with Asil dan Roth and a\nfew other military wives. Her husband was recently appointed Master of the\nKing’s Armouries, I believe.”\n“What good fortune,” murmured her father, drily.\nGorst’s next lunge was positively belittling. “I’m not made of glass,\neither,” said Savine, flicking irritably at the point of his steel. “Come at me\nlike you mean it.”\nShe had been fencing all her life, after all. As a girl, she had dreamed of\nwinning the Contest disguised as a man, whipping off her cap to reveal her\ngolden tresses to an ecstatic crowd. Then wigs had come into fashion and\nshe had shaved her tresses off, which, honestly, had been a rather\nunprepossessing brown in any case. Then she had learned men never cheer\nfor a woman who beats them at their own games, so she had left the fencing\ncircle to the cocks and decided to count her victories at the bank.\nShe parried two efforts which were scarcely stronger than before and,\nthis time, stepped neatly around the lazy cut that followed and gave Gorst a\nshove with the basketwork of her short steel. “Do you hit like a woman as\nwell as talk like one?”\nGorst’s eye gave the faintest twitch. “Ouch!” called her father. “A touch\nto the lady.”\n“I want to know how it feels to be attacked by a dangerous man who\nmeans it.” Savine set herself again, confident in her stance, confident in her\ngrip, confident in her abilities. “Otherwise what’s the point?”"

His flat face\nhardly showed emotion, but it was as if a door had opened a chink, and\nbeyond it Savine glimpsed something monstrous.\nIt is easy to smile at the bull you know is chained. When you realise of a\nsudden the chain is off, and its horns towards you, and its hoof scraping at\nthe dust, the bull looks an entirely different animal.\nShe half-opened her mouth to say, “Wait.”\n“Begin.”\nShe had been ready for his strength.

Her eyes went wide as his\nlong steel whipped down and she had just the presence of mind to sidestep,\nbringing up her short steel to parry.\nShe had not been ready for his strength after all. The force of it numbed\nher arm from fingertips to shoulder, rattled the teeth in her head. She\nstumbled back, gasping, but his short steel was already coming at her,\ncrashing into her long, ripping it from her numb fingers and sending it\nskittering across the floor. She flapped blindly with her short, all training\nand technique forgotten, saw a flash of metal—\nHis long steel thudded into her padded jacket and drove her breath out in\na burning wheeze, nearly lifted her off her feet and sent her tottering\nsideways. A moment later, his shoulder rammed into her body. Her head\nsnapped forward, her face crunched against something. The blunt top of his\nskull, maybe.\nWas she in the air?\nThe wall smashed her in the back, the bare room reeled and, to her great\nsurprise, she found herself on hands and knees, blinking at the floor.\nSpots of blood pit-pattered onto the polished wood in front of her face.\n“Oh,” she gasped.\nHer ribs throbbed with each snatched breath, sick scalding the back of\nher throat. Her hand was all tangled up in the basketwork of her short steel,\nand she flopped it drunkenly around until the sword clattered onto the floor.\nThe backs of her fingers were all grazed. She put them to her throbbing\nmouth and they came away bloody. Her hand was shaking. She was shaking\nall over.\nIt hurt. Her face, her side, her pride. But it was not the pain that really\nshook her. It was the powerlessness. The total misjudgement of her own\nabilities. The curtain had been twitched aside, and she saw just how fragile\nshe was.

Constant pain, as he\nalways liked to say, had cured him of that. “Fencing is one thing,” he said.\n“Actual violence quite another. Few of us are made for it. It is healthy to be\ndisabused of our self-deceptions every now and then, even if it hurts.”\nHe smiled while she wiped the blood from her nose. Savine had given\nup trying to understand him. Most of the time, she was the one thing he\nloved in a world he despised. Then, on occasion, he treated her like a rival\nto be crushed.\n“If you are attacked by a dangerous man who means it, my advice is to\nrun away.” Gorst stood, offering his broad hand. “I expect he will destroy\nhimself before too long.”\nWhen he pulled her up, her legs were jelly. “Thank you, Colonel Gorst.\nThat was… a very useful lesson.” She wanted to cry. Or her body did, at\nleast. She would not let it. She set her aching jaw and stuck her chin up at\nhim. “Same time next week?”\nHer father barked out a laugh and slapped the arm of his chair. “That’s\nmy girl!”\nPromises\nB\nroad lay awake, staring at the ceiling.\nThere was a crack, next to a yellowed blister on the limewash. Felt like\nhe’d been staring at it all night. Staring at it as the sun crawled up over the\nnarrow buildings, through the washing strung between them and into the\nnarrow street, through the narrow window and into the one-room cellar they\nwere living in.\nFelt like he’d been staring at that crack for weeks. Turning things over in\nhis mind. Fretting at them as if they were big choices he had to make. But\nthey were big choices he’d already made, and he’d made the wrong ones,\nand now there was no changing them.\nHe took a heavy breath, felt it catch at the back of his throat. That oily\nscratch on the Valbeck air. That smell of shit and onions the cellar always\nhad, no matter how Liddy scrubbed it. It was in the walls. It was in his skin.\nFolk were setting off to work outside, boots tramping through the muck\nbeyond the tiny window near the ceiling, shadows of their passing\nflickering on the mould-speckled wall.\n“How are your hands?” murmured Liddy, twisting towards him on the\nnarrow bed.\nHe winced as he worked the fingers. “Always sore in the mornings.”\nLiddy took his big hand in her small ones, rubbing at his aching palm, at\nhis throbbing knuckles. “May up already?”\n“She slipped out.

The fear. Even if\nit was only his own disappointment, and worry, and fear reflected back, like\nin a mirror.\n“It’s not fair on her,” he whispered at that crack in the ceiling. “She\nshould be having a life. Dancing, courting. Not waiting on some rich\nbastard.”\n“She doesn’t mind doing it. She wants to help. She’s a good girl.”\n“She’s the best thing I’ve done. She’s the only good thing I’ve done.”\n“You’ve done good, Gunnar. You’ve done lots of good.”\n“You don’t know what it was like, in Styria. What I was like—”\n“Then do good now.” An edge of impatience in her voice, and she gave\nhis hand one last squeeze and let it go. “You can’t change what’s past, can\nyou? Only what’s next.”\nHe wanted to argue but couldn’t find a crack in her obvious good sense.\nHe lay there sullen, listening to the shuffle of boots and the yammer of\nangry voices and a girl at the crossroads yelling out bad news for coppers. A\nbread riot in Holsthorm, and a plot to burn a mill in Keln, and unrest in\nevery corner of Midderland, and war. War in the North.\n“It’s my fault,” he muttered. Couldn’t find a way to attack Liddy, so he\nambushed himself. “I should never have gone to war.”\n“I let you go. I let the farm go.”\n“The farm was done anyway. That life was done. Would’ve been better\nfor you and May if I’d never come back.”\nShe put her hand on his cheek, firm. Turned his head so she was looking\nhim straight in the face. “Don’t ever say that, Gunnar. Don’t ever say that.”\n“I killed ’em, Liddy,” he whispered. “I killed ’em.”\nShe said nothing. What could she say?\n“I fucked it all,” he said. “In one moment. Is there a thing I can’t ruin?”\n“There’s nothing can’t be ruined in a moment,” said Liddy. “It all hangs\nby a thread, all the time. We’ve got to look forward now. That’s what you\ndo. You move on.”\n“I’ll put it right,” he said. “I’ll find work here.”\n“I know you will.” She forced out a smile. Looked like it took a lot of\neffort, but she forced it out. “You’re a good man, Gunnar.”\nHe winced at that, felt the pain of tears at the back of his nose. “No more\nviolence,” he said, voice thick and throaty. “I promise, Liddy.” He realised\nhe’d clenched his fists, forced them to open. “From now on I’ll stay out of\ntrouble.”\n“Gunnar,” she murmured, soft and serious, “you should only make\npromises you know you can keep.”\nA little sprinkle of dust came floating down onto their bed. Along the\nstreet at the foundry, the engines were starting up, making the whole room\ntremble."

        "text": "promises you know you can keep.”\nA little sprinkle of dust came floating down onto their bed. Along the\nstreet at the foundry, the engines were starting up, making the whole room\ntremble.\nWasn’t until he got around the corner Broad even realised what he was\nqueueing for.\nCadman’s Ales was printed in gilded paint above the sliding warehouse\ndoors, the bang and clatter of work booming from inside. A brewery. He’d\nspent half his time in Styria drunk and the rest aiming to get drunk. He’d\npromised no trouble, and he knew that for him, every bottle had trouble at\nthe bottom.\nStill, temptation was never far away in Valbeck. Every other building\nhad a tap-house or a jerry-shop or a still in it, licensed or otherwise, whores\nand thieves and beggars buzzing around them like flies at a midden, and if\nyou couldn’t make it as far as next door to drown your misery, there were\nboys running the streets with barrels on their backs who’d bring the beer to\nyou.\nA brewery was a poor omen, far as Broad’s promise to stay clear of\ntrouble was concerned. But he’d seen no good omens in Valbeck, and he\nneeded work. So he pulled his coat closed and hunched his shoulders\nagainst the thin rain that fell black out of the murky sky like ink, and\nshuffled forward another half-step.\n“However early I get here, there’s always a queue,” said a grey-faced,\ngrey-haired old man in a coat worn through at the elbows.\n“More and more folk coming into Valbeck for the work,” muttered one\nof the others.\n“Always more folk wanting work. Never enough to go around. Used to\nbe I had a house o’ my own, up the valley near Hambernalt. You know it?”\n“Can’t say I do,” muttered Broad, thinking of his own valley. The green\ntrees in the breeze, the green grass soft around his ankles. He knew things\nwere always better in your memory and the farm had been hard work for\nlean rewards, but it had been green. There was nothing green in Valbeck.\nExcept the river, maybe, stained with great coloured smears from the dyeing\nworks upstream.\n“Beautiful valley, it used to be,” the old man was droning. “Good house,\nI had, in the woods there, by the river. Raised five boys in it. Used to be\ngood money in coppicing, burning charcoal, you know. Then they started\nmaking charcoal cheap in a furnace upstream and the river got full of tar.”\nHe gave a long, helpless sniff. “Prices just kept falling. Then Lord bloody\nBarezin cleared the forest for more grazing land anyway.”\nA big wagon clattered past, rattling wheels ripping muck out of the road\nand showering it across the queue, and men grumbled and shouted abuse at\nthe driver and the driver grumbled and shouted abuse at the men, and they\nall shuffled forwards another half-step.\n“My boys went off to other things. One died in Styria. One got married\ndown near Keln, I heard. I had to borrow and I lost the house. Beautiful\nvalley, it used to be.”\n“Aye, well,” muttered Broad, feeling too sorry for himself to much enjoy\nanyone else doing the same. “Used to be gets you nowhere.”"

A veteran, no doubt. The anger in his voice set Broad’s heart\nthumping. A tickle of excitement.\nThe old man stared. “I’m not wanting to cause no offence—”\n“That’s why you should shut your fucking hole.”\nJust stay silent. Just stay out of it. He should’ve learned that lesson,\nshouldn’t he? Learned it a dozen times and more. He’d promised Liddy.\nJust hours since he promised her. No more trouble.\n“Leave him be,” growled Broad.\n“What’d you say?”\nBroad took his lenses off and slipped them into his coat pocket, the\nqueue behind the man’s frowning face made a blur.\n“I get it,” said Broad. “You’re disappointed. Don’t reckon any man here\nhad life turn out just the way he hoped, do you?”\n“What d’you know about my hopes?”\nTook everything he had not to smash this bastard’s skull. But he’d\npromised Liddy. So Broad just took a step forwards, so the spit from his\nbared teeth flecked the man’s scarred cheek.\n“I know you’ll find none of ’em facing this way.” He lifted his fist.\nTurned his finger. “Now turn around ’fore I put your fucking head through\nthe wall.”\nThe man’s scarred cheek twitched and, just for a moment, Broad thought\nhe might fight. For one beautiful moment, he thought he could stop clinging\non, and let go. The first time he’d felt free since he came back from Styria.\nWell, apart from when he smashed Lennart Seldom’s face in.\nThen the man’s bloodshot eyes found Broad’s fist. The tattoo on the\nback of it. He grumbled something and turned around. He stood, shifting his\nweight from one foot to the other. Then he pulled his shabby collar up, and\ncut out of the line, and stalked away.\n“Thanks for that,” said the old man, knob on the front of his scrawny\nthroat bobbing. “Ain’t many folk left will do the decent thing.”\n“The decent thing.” Broad winced as he worked his fingers open.\nSeemed the only time they didn’t hurt was when his fists were clenched.\n“Don’t even know what that is any more.”\nHe’d seen a lot of different men at the end of these queues, choosing\nwho got work and who got nothing. Most had developed a liking for\nwatching folk squirm. It had been the same with the officers in Styria. It’s a\nrare man who’s made better by a bit of power.\nThe foreman at the door of Cadman’s Ales looked like one of the better\nones, though, sat under a little awning with a big ledger in front of him.\nGrey-haired and solid, every movement slow and precise, like he’d taken"

He was a bad liar, and got the\nfeeling this man saw straight through him.\n“I’m Malmer.” He gave Broad a careful look up and down. “Got any\nexperience with breweries?”\n“Guess I’ve drunk a fair bit o’ their output down the years.” Broad tried\na grin, but Malmer didn’t look like joining him. “But no experience with\nmaking it, no.” Malmer just gave a slow nod, like he was used to\ndisappointment. “I’ll work hard, though.” He’d had but two hours’ work\nthat week, raking out stables. This was his third stop today, and he couldn’t\ngo home empty-handed. “I’ll shovel coal, or I’ll sweep floors, or… well…\nwhatever you want. I’ll work hard, I promise you that.”\nMalmer gave a sad little smile. “Promises are cheap, friend.”\n“Shitting hell! Is that Sergeant Broad?”\nA lean man with a sandy beard and a stained apron had come striding\nout of the brewery, hands on hips. Broad knew the face, but it took a while\nto riddle out where he’d seen it before and slot it into the world he lived in\nnow. “Sarlby?”\n“This is Bull Broad!” Sarlby grabbed Broad’s hand and yanked it like he\nwas trying to get water from a stiff pump. “Remember, Malmer, I told you\nall about him! Fought with him in Styria! Behind him, anyway, weren’t\nsuch a good idea to be in front.”\nMalmer sat back, giving Broad that careful look again. “You told me a\nlot of stories about Styria. Must confess I somewhat stopped listening.”\n“Well, start fucking listening ’cause this is about the best man I know!\nFirst up the ladders at the siege of Borletta! First didn’t fall straight back\ndown, leastways. He was always the first man in. How many times? Five?”\nHe caught Broad’s wrist and pushed his sleeve up to show the stars on his\nknuckles. “Look at those bastards!” Like he was showing off some prize\nvegetable. “Look at those bastards.”\nBroad pulled his hand free, drew it up into his sleeve. “I put all that\nbehind me.”\n“In my experience, the past don’t drop back far,” said Malmer. “You’ll\nvouch for him?”\n“Ain’t a man he served with wouldn’t vouch for him ten times over. By\nall the fucking Fates, yes, I’ll vouch for him!”\n“Then you’re hired.” Malmer dipped his pen, calmly tapped it off and let\nit hover over his ledger. “So… Bull? Or Broad?”\n“Gunnar Bull,” said Broad. “Put that down.”\n“Address?”\n“We’re in a cellar on Draw Street. Houses there don’t have numbers.”\n“In the cellars?” Sarlby shook his head in disgust. “We’ll get you out of\nthere, don’t worry.” And he hooked a friendly arm around Broad’s\nshoulders and led him through into the noisy, smelly warmth of the brewery."

Thought you had a farm\nsomewhere.”\n“Had to sell it,” muttered Broad, stumbling on the lie.\nSarlby just grinned. “Trouble, eh?”\n“Aye,” croaked Broad. “A little.”\n“Want a nip?” he asked, holding out a flask.\nBroad did, in fact. A lot more than was healthy. Took an effort to force\nout the words. “Best not. I never could leave it at one.”\n“You weren’t so shy in Styria, as I recall,” said Sarlby, taking a swig.\n“I’m trying not to make the same mistakes twice.”\n“That’s all I ever bloody seem to do! What do you make of Valbeck?”\n“It’s all right, I guess.”\n“It’s a fucking slag heap. It’s a fucking meat grinder. It’s a fucking pit.”\n“Aye.” Broad puffed out his cheeks. “It’s a pit.”\n“Fine for the rich folks up on the hill but what do we get? We who\nfought for our country? Open sewers. Three families to a room. Filth in the\nstreets. The weak preyed on by the strong. There was a time folk cared\nabout doing the right thing, wasn’t there?”\n“Was there?”\nBut Sarlby didn’t hear. “Now all a man’s worth is how much work can\nbe squeezed from him. We’re husks to be scraped out and tossed away.\nWe’re cogs in the big machine. But there’s those who are trying to make it\nbetter.”\nBroad raised a brow at that. “I find men who prate a lot on making\nthings better tend to make ’em a whole lot worse on the way.”\nSarlby didn’t hear that, either. He’d always been a great one for not\nhearing things he didn’t want to. Maybe everyone is. He leaned close, like\nhe’d a secret to share. “You heard of the Breakers?”\n“Bandits, ain’t they? Break machines. Burn mills. Traitors, I heard.”\n“Only the fucking Inquisition say so.” Sarlby spat on the sawdust-\nscattered ground. He’d always been a great one for spitting, too. “The\nBreakers are going to change things! They don’t just break machines,\nBroad, they break chains. Your chains and mine.”\n“I’ve got no chains on me.”\n“Says the man living in a cellar on Draw Street. I’m not talking about\nchains on your wrists, Broad. I’m talking about chains on your mind.\nChains on your future! On your children’s futures. The masters’ll be\nbrought low! Those who get fat on our sweat and our pain. The lords and\nladies. The kings and princes.” Sarlby’s eyes glittered at the fine future he\nsaw coming. “No more rich old bastards telling us how it’s going to be.\nEvery man with a say in how he’s governed. Every man with a vote.”\n“So no more king?”\n“Every man’ll be a king!”\nBroad might’ve called it treason once, but his patriotic feelings had\ntaken quite the kicking the last couple of years.

You were always at your best\nwith your fists clenched.”\nBroad winced at that. “At my worst, too.”\n“You were there, on the walls. You know how it is. Anything worth\nanything has to be fought for!” And Sarlby bared his teeth and punched at\nthe air, a Ladderman’s tattoo like Broad’s showing on the back of his fist.\n“Maybe.” Broad felt a tickle of excitement, a stab of joy, but he pushed\nit away, twisted his own hand up into his sleeve as far as it would go. “But\nI’ve fought enough.”\nHe’d made Liddy a promise. This time, he meant to keep it.\nA Blow for the Common Man\n“E\nverything ready?” asked Sibalt. Even in the darkness, Vick could sense\nhis nerves, and it didn’t help with hers.\nShe glanced up at Moor, a big outline on the wagon’s seat, reins in his\nhands. She glanced at Tallow, perched beside him, rain beaded on his\noversized oilskin. She almost asked again if they were sure they wanted to\ndo this. But there’s a time when doubts might do some good. A time to\nchew over the risks and the consequences. Then a moment passes. A\nmoment you might not even notice. Then it’s too late, and you’ve got to\ncommit, and give it everything with no backward glances.\n“It’s ready,” she said. “Let’s go.”\nGrise caught her arm in the darkness. “What about them?” And she\njerked her head towards the two bedraggled nightwatchmen either side of\nthe foundry’s gate, faces pinched in the light of their own lanterns.\n“They’re paid.”\n“You paid the fuckers?”\n“It’s easier to shift a man with gold than steel, and it almost always ends\nup cheaper.” And before Grise had the chance to answer, Vick struck out\nacross the street, head down, collar up.\nShe glanced each way, but the drizzle was on their side, the lane almost\nempty. The blood thudded in her head as she walked to the gate. Fear\ncreeping up her throat and making her want to rush, want to shout. She told\nherself she’d been in tighter corners and knew it was true. She kept her\nbreaths deep, her steps slow.\n“Got a delivery for you,” she said, shocked by how calm her own voice\nsounded.\nThe nightwatchman lifted his lantern to get a look at her and Vick\nnarrowed her eyes at the glare. He knocked on the gates and there was the\nclatter of a bar being lifted. They took deliveries all night here. Nothing to\nremark upon.\n“Let’s go!” called Vick, and Moor gave the reins a flick, brought the\nwagon across the muddy street and through into the darkened yard.

The side\nof the shed loomed up, cliff-like, the angry gleam of fires beyond the\nwindows.\nMoor called softly to the big carthorse and slipped on the brake, handed\nthe reins to Tallow. Sibalt clambered down from the back of the wagon,\nwiping his hands on his leather apron.\n“Working so far,” he muttered as he walked with Vick to the great\nfoundry door.\n“So far,” she said. The big padlock had been left open and she slid it\nfrom the hasp, planted her hands on the big handle next to Sibalt’s. His\nhands and hers, side by side. They heaved together, wheels clattering as the\ndoor slid open.\nA waft of heat spilled from inside. The furnaces, and the engines, and\nthe forges still giving off a welcoming glow. It’d never be cold in here,\nnever be dark. Vick picked out the black outlines of the ironwork. The\nskeleton of the building. The pillars where they’d pack the powder.\nShe started back towards the wagon as Sibalt slid the door all the way\nopen. Grise had already unlashed the tarp and dragged it away, the barrels\nshowing underneath.\n“All right,” hissed Vick at her, “let’s get that first one—”\nLight flooded the yard and they all stood frozen, blinking in the glare.\nHooded lanterns, suddenly opened all around them. Grise on the back of the\nwagon, rope in her hands. Moor with fingers hooked under the first barrel.\nTallow holding the reins, his eyes bigger than ever. Sibalt in the wide\ndoorway of the foundry.\nThat fast, their plans turned to shit.\n“Hold!” bellowed a voice. “In the name of His Majesty!”\nThe big carthorse startled, dragged the wagon screeching forwards with\nits brake on. Grise tumbled over the side.\nMoor stood, letting go of the barrel and snatching up a hatchet.\nTallow gave a high shriek. Not even a word.\nThere was a clicking, a fluttering. Bolts thudded into the wagon’s side.\nThudded into Moor, too.\nVick was already running. She caught Sibalt and dragged him into the\nfoundry. They wove between the engines, the wagons, the rails, as they\nwhipped up from the firelit gloom. Sibalt gasped as he slipped and went\nbowling into some crates, lengths of metal scattering across the stones with\na clash and clang.\nShe helped him up, nearly falling herself, pulled him on, her breath and\nhis hissing and wheezing, their slapping footfalls echoing from the roof\nhigh above. She glanced back, saw lights twinkling, a flicker of movement,\nheard shouts in the darkness.\nShe gasped as something caught her head—a dangling chain, left\nswinging in her wake. A few more steps and Sibalt grabbed her by the\nelbow, dragged her down into a shadowy space between two great iron\ntanks. She was about to ask why when she saw the lights ahead. Heard the\nfootsteps. They were closing in from both sides."

Vick glanced down and saw he had a dagger in his fist, the\norange of the furnaces glinting along its edge. She drew away a little on an\ninstinct. “You don’t think it was me?”\n“No. But it doesn’t matter.”\nShe could hear Grise screaming somewhere. “Come on, you fuckers!\nCome on!”\n“You said it yourself,” said Sibalt. “Once they get you, everyone talks.\nSorry to leave you in the lurch like this.”\n“What are you saying?” Her voice didn’t sound calm any more.\nHe smiled at her. That sad little smile. “Wish I’d met you sooner. Things\nmight’ve been different.

Her trousers soaked with blood as\nit spread in a great warm slick.\nSibalt stared up at her, spluttering black from his mouth, from his nose.\nMaybe he was trying to give her some message. Regret, or forgiveness, or\nhope, or blame. No way of knowing.\nGrise’s screams had turned to meaningless screeches, then muffled\ngurgles. The sounds of someone with a bag forced over their head.\nSibalt’s eyes were glassy now, and Vick let go of his leaking neck.

That’s the trouble with\nplans. Not many survive being chased through a downpour by a pack of\ndogs. Wet brambles clutched at her ankle, snatched it from under her and\nshe reeled, howl cut off as she smashed face-first into a tree, fell and rolled\nhelpless through thorn bushes, over and over, yelping with every bounce\nand giving a long groan as she slid on her face through a heap of sodden\nleaves.\nShe looked up to see a big pair of boots. She looked up higher and saw a\nman standing in them, looking down with an expression more of\npuzzlement than triumph.\n“Quite the entrance,” he said.\nHe wasn’t tall, but solid as a tree, great meaty gut, great meaty forearms,\ngreat meaty neck and jowls, thumbs tucked into a weathered sword-belt. He\nmight’ve been the same height as Rikke, but easily twice her weight. One of\nhis cheeks was all puckered with an old scar."

One of\nhis cheeks was all puckered with an old scar.\nShe spat out some bits of leaf and whispered, “Fuck.”\nBut instead of grabbing her around the throat, he just stepped back and\nbowed.\n“Please.” And he offered her the way with one broad palm, like one of\nthose fancy footmen in Ostenhorm might’ve done.\nNo time to wonder about the gift, only to grab it with both hands.\n“Thanks,” she wheezed as she clambered up, mouth tasting of blood. Her\nsoggy shirt was hopelessly snarled on the thorns and she wriggled free of it,\nlurching on winded in her vest.\nDogs barked behind and she snatched blurred glances over her shoulder,\nshadows dancing in the rain-lashed forest, sure at every jolting step their\nteeth would sink into her arse and bring her down. Someone was crashing\nthrough the woods ahead, she heard Isern shout, “Rikke? You there?”\n“Right…” she gurgled, “behind you!”\nThen light flashed between trunks, the trees opening up. She felt a giddy\nsurge of relief which, as usual, soon turned to horror. They’d seen the scar\nthrough the woods from higher up and thought there must be a river. But\nthrough the curtains of rain, there’d been no way of knowing it was cut into\na deep ravine.\nShe knew it now. A rocky edge, sprouting with sick grass, clung to by\nstunted little trees, beaten water thundering below. She saw Isern spring,\narching back in the air, spear over her head. She saw her clear the gap, a\ndaunting four strides wide at least, roll through the wet moss and ferns\nclinging to the far side and come smoothly to her feet.\nFor an instant, Rikke thought about stopping. Then she thought about\ngetting fucked by Stour Nightfall’s horse and of a sudden, getting smashed\nto paste in the bottom of a gorge seemed a pretty fine outcome. Wasn’t like\nshe could stop anyway, belting full-tilt down a steep and slippery bank. She\npushed herself faster, chest heaving, teeth rattling, and trusted to luck,\nhowever bad her luck had been lately.\nThe ravine yawned wide as she burst from the trees, a glimpse of jagged\nrock dropping away to white water.\nShe got a firm footing at the edge, which was lucky, and a decent push\noff with her right leg, which was good, and she went up something lovely,\nwind cold in her wide-open mouth, flying into the flitting rain.\nIt was just that she started coming down too soon. Maybe if she’d eaten\nsomething that day, there’d have been more spring in her. But she hadn’t.\nShe clawed at the air, like she might be able to drag herself closer, but she\nwas dropping fast now and didn’t need the Long Eye to see she’d fall short.\nThe terrible justice of the ground.

She clutched desperately at wet leaves, wet roots, wet grass,\nno strength, no breath, dirt sprinkling in her eyes as she started sliding over\nthe edge, fingernails uselessly scrabbling.\nThen Isern’s hand clamped around her wrist. Isern’s face above her,\nscrewed up with furious effort, scar white on her lips, tongue wedged into\nthe hole in her clenched teeth. Rikke groaned as her shoulder stretched,\nfeeling like her whole arm would rip from the socket.\nProbably she should’ve told Isern to let her go, big dramatic gesture,\ntime for a single tear before she plunged to her doom, but that’s not how it\nworks when the Great Leveller’s breathing on your neck. She clutched at\nIsern’s sinewy arm like a drowning woman to the mast of a sinking ship,\nchoking and struggling and kicking and like as not to drag them both over.\n“You’re heavier than you fucking—gah!”\nSomething flickered past and Isern gave a grunt, pulled even harder.\nRikke’s flailing foot caught on rock and she managed to shove herself\nupwards. Finally heaved a breath into her aching chest, growled as she\npushed again and Isern went over backwards, dragging Rikke on top of her,\nthe two of them rolling together into the soaking bracken.\n“Move!” Isern staggered up, fell, crawled on, dragging her spear along\nwith a handful of torn grass. There was an arrow through her leg. Rikke\ncould see the bloody head sticking from the back of her thigh.\nShe looked over her shoulder, through the slackening rain saw dogs\nyapping and growling and prowling at the ravine’s edge and, a few strides\nabove them, a man kneeling in the trees. Close enough she could see the\nfrown on his dirty face, the frayed edge of his archery guard, the bow drawn\nin his hand.\nHer eyes went wide, and one burned hot. Hot as a glowing coal in her\nskull.\nShe heard the flapping click of the bowstring.\nShe saw the arrow.\nBut she saw it with the Long Eye.\nAnd for an instant, like the dawn sun blazing into her room as the\nshutters were flung wide, the absolute knowing of that arrow burst upon her.\nShe saw where it was, all it was, where it had been and would be.\nShe saw its making, smith with teeth clenched as he hammered out the\nhead, fletcher with tongue wedged in his cheek as he trimmed the flights.\nShe saw its ending, shaft rotted and head flaked away to rust among the\nbrambles.\nShe saw it in the quiver hooked over the foot of the archer’s bed as he\nkissed his wife Riam goodbye and hoped that her broken toe mended.\nShe saw its bright point cut through a falling raindrop and scatter it into\nglittering mist.\nShe knew with utter certainty where that arrow would be, always.

So she\nflicked her hand out, and when it came to meet her, as she knew it must, it\nwas the easiest thing to push it. Just to nudge it with her finger so it missed\nIsern as she limped away and spun off harmless into the trees, bouncing\nonce and coming to rest in the undergrowth in its right place, in the only\nplace it could be, where she’d seen it rot away among the brambles.\n“By the dead,” breathed Rikke, staring at her hand.\nThere was a bead of blood on the tip of her forefinger. Arrowhead\nmust’ve grazed it. And a quivering shiver went all the way through her. She\nhadn’t really believed it till this moment, not even when she saw Uffrith\nburning, just like in her dream. But now there was no denying it.\nShe had the Long Eye.\nIt still throbbed, warm in her clammy face. She stared at the archer, his\nbrow knitted up in shock as he stared back, his jaw dropping lower and\nlower.\nA great joyous, wondering giggle bubbled up at the impossible thing\nshe’d done, and Rikke stuck her fist up and screamed, “Give my regards to\nRiam! Hope her toe mends!” Then she scampered after Isern, caught her\nunder the armpit and helped her on into the dripping trees.\nBut not before she caught a glimpse of a rope bridge a hundred strides\nupstream, bouncing and twisting as men hurried across it, sharpened metal\ngleaming with wet. How many men, she couldn’t tell. Enough, that was the\nnumber, and the joy of knowing the arrow was squashed straight out of her.\n“Come on,” she hissed as they blundered through the clutching,\nsnagging, sodden bushes. Isern fell snarling and Rikke helped her up but\nshe was slow, now, everything heavy with damp, her leg dragging.\n“Go,” she snapped. “I’ll follow.”\n“No,” said Rikke, hauling her on.\nShe thought she heard fighting behind them. Men screaming. Dogs\nwhimpering. Scrape and clatter of steel. The trees echoed with it,\neverywhere and nowhere. Branches whipped at her and Rikke clawed them\naway, broke through into a boggy clearing. The rain was down to a drizzle,\na broken wall of mossy rock ahead, slick with trickling water.\n“Go.” Isern turned towards the woods, growled in pain as her wounded\nleg gave and she slid onto her side. “Climb!”\n“No,” said Rikke, “I’m not leaving you.”\n“Better one of us live than neither. Go.”\n“No,” said Rikke. She could hear someone crashing through the trees\ntowards them. Someone big.\n“Get behind me, then.” Isern pushed Rikke back, but she could only\nstand leaning on her spear. She’d be fighting no one. Not winning, anyway.\n“I’ve hid behind you long enough.” Strange thing, but Rikke didn’t feel\nscared any more. “I’m not much of a climber anyway.” She peeled Isern’s"

A big man in a\nweather-stained coat, holding a scarred shield and a sword with a silver\nletter near the hilt. Even through the grey hair hanging lank across his face,\nRikke could see the awful scar, from his forehead through his brow and\nacross his cheek to the corner of his mouth, and in the misshapen socket of\nhis left eye there was no eye at all, but a bright ball of dead metal, gleaming\nas the sun broke through above.\nHe raised his brows at the two of them, hunched and bloodied against\nthe rocky wall. Or he raised the good one, anyway. The burned one just\ntwitched a little. Then he spoke in a voice like the grinding of a mill wheel.\n“Been looking for you two.”\nRikke stood still, for a moment, just staring. Then she stepped towards\nhim, letting out a long, shuddering breath, and she tossed the spear down in\nthe grass and flung her arms around him.\n“Took your fucking time, Caul Shivers!” Isern snarled through clenched\nteeth. “There’s some of Nightfall’s boys hunting us.”\n“Put ’em out o’ your mind.” And Rikke saw his sword was all dashed\nand speckled with red. He’d always been a man who could get a lot said in\na few words. “Can you walk?”\n“Without the arrow,” hissed Isern, “I could run rings around you.”\n“Don’t doubt it.” Shivers puffed out cheeks scattered with silver stubble\nas he squatted beside her. “But you’ve got the arrow.” And he poked at it\nwith one big finger and made her grimace.\n“You are not fucking carrying me,” she growled.\n“Ain’t high on my list o’ wants, believe it or not.” Shivers slid his sword\nthrough the clasp at his belt. “But once you’ve a task to do, it’s better to do\nit—”\n“Than live with the fear of it,” Rikke finished for him. It was one of her\nfather’s favourites.\nShivers pulled Isern up by one arm and hefted her over his shoulder as if\nshe weighed nothing at all. With what they’d been eating, she probably\nwasn’t far off.\n“This is a bloody indignity,” Isern grunted into Shivers’ back as he\nstarted walking."

Now she was something close to\nsafe her strength had all leaked away, and her face was twitching and her\nknees were knocking, and she felt like she might topple over right there and\nnever get up.\n“You always were a moaner.” Shivers shook his head. “Come on. Your\nfather’s waiting.”\nBiding Time, Wasting Time\n“E\nver think maybe you drink too much?” asked Wonderful.\nClover smacked his lips. “Too much would, by definition, be too much. I\nfind however much I drink is just the right amount.” And he offered her the\nbottle.\nShe shook her head. “Drunks tend to say that.”\nClover treated her to his aggrieved look. “As do the broadly sober.”\nHe’d a wonderful aggrieved look. Lots of practice. “I find myself\naggrieved. Have you ever seen me lose a fight on account of drunkenness?”\n“I’ve never seen you fight.”\nClover slapped the cork back into the bottle. “A clear indication of\nreasonable drinking if ever there was one.”\n“Well, if I was you, I’d at least look sober.” Wonderful pointed one of\nher brows off down the track. “The Great Wolf approaches.”\nAnd approach he did, with high drama. Storming and swaggering at\nonce with his brow well creased and his brooding young stags at his back,\nmaking Thralls scatter from their path like chickens in a farmyard. Given all\nthe damp still in the air, it was a wonder they weren’t steaming.\n“Here come the gods of war,” mouthed Clover, and then out loud, as the\nGreat Wolf stalked closer, “Drink, Chief?”\nStour slapped the bottle from his hand and it bounced away into the\nbushes.\nClover looked sadly after it. “I’ll take that as a no.”\n“She got away!” snarled the king-in-waiting, in quite the fury even for\nhim. “Fucking little bitch got away!”\n“We’re all distraught.”\n“She came through right where you were supposed to be!” snapped a\nbastard of Stour’s called Greenway. If legends were built on sneering, he’d\nhave had quite a place in the songs. “Did you see her?”\n“Saw her shirt,” said Clover, tossing the torn thing over. “At least, I’m\nguessing it was hers. Doubt it’ll fit you, though. Bit tight under the arms, I\nexpect—”\nGreenway flung it angrily on the ground. “Did you see her?”\n“If I had, I’d have caught her.”\n“You’d have had to fucking get up to do that,” snarled Magweer, aiming\nfor the same caged-wolf act as Stour but only managing a fraction of the\nmenace.\n“I’d have sung out, anyway,” said Clover. “That I can do sitting down.”\nHe wondered why he hadn’t sung out.

If you can’t\nfind a way to win that doesn’t involve torturing some half-mad girl, then\nmaybe you don’t deserve to win at all. Or maybe that was all shit, and it\nwas just ’cause she was pretty. The sad truth is that pretty people can slide\nthrough all kinds of scrapes that’d end very badly for the ugly.\nClover looked from Greenway to Magweer and shrugged. “Seems\nhunting girls just ain’t my sport.”\nStour stepped closer, staring at Clover with those ever-wet eyes of his.\n“Your sport is whatever I say it is.”\nClover shrugged it off. “I’m eager to serve, great prince, but I can’t just\nturn into a butterfly. Your father sent me for my cunning, not my running.\nWhy, you might as well order the river to blow and the wind to flow.”\n“You’re loyal, ain’t you, Clover?” Magweer said it softly, like it was\nsome brilliant trap of words.\n“Reasonably so, I like to think. A man has to bend with the breeze.”\n“You turned on Glama Golden, I heard,” said Greenway, climbing to\nnew heights of sneer. “Cairm Ironhead, too.”\n“I was loyal to both,” said Clover. “I was just more loyal to me. Truth is,\nmen love to blab about loyalty till it might trap ’em on the losing side. Then\nthere’s a chorus o’ silence on the issue. So I consider reasonably loyal to be\na bit more loyal than most, and a lot more honest than most. It’s a fool who\nmakes folk choose too often between loyalty and good sense. How’d she\nget loose, anyway?”\n“Caul Shivers was waiting on the other side of the river,” hissed Stour,\nclenching his fists. “Killed four of my men.”\n“Shivers.” Magweer was clenching his fists just the same way. “Wish I’d\nrun into that old fucker.”\nWonderful and Clover burst out laughing at the exact same time. He\nleaned forward, hands on his knees, and she leaned back, fist on his\nshoulder, and no doubt they made quite a picture chortling away but they\nreally couldn’t help ’emsleves.\n“Good one,” said Clover, with a sigh. “Good one.”\n“What’s so fucking funny?”\nWonderful waved a finger at Magweer’s collection of weapons. “My\nfriend, if you’d run into Caul Shivers, you’d be wearing all those axes up\nyour arse. You should take care charging at fights. Sooner or later, you’ll\ntrip over a bigger one than you wanted.”\n“There’s no fight too big for me,” he growled back.\n“Really?” asked Wonderful. “What if it’s just you and nineteen o’\nthem?”\nMagweer opened his mouth, strained, but couldn’t find a reply. He was a\nchild’s notion of what a warrior should be, all scowl and muscle and\ncarrying half a blacksmith’s shop around. Clover gave a sigh. “You need to\ncalm down, my friend.”"

When the Bloody-Nine fought the Feared?”\n“On behalf of your grandfather, Bethod,” said Clover. “Eighteen years\nold and knowing half o’ nothing and thinking myself quite the hard\nbastard.”\n“Everyone says that was a great duel,” breathed Stour, a faraway look in\nhis wet eyes.\n“It was a bloody one. Sadly, I walked away with the wrong lessons.\nEnough that I ended up taking a challenge or two myself…” Clover found\nhe was scratching at his scar, and made himself leave it alone. “If you want\nmy advice, stay out of the Circle.”\n“The Circle is where names are made!” barked Stour, thumping his chest\nwith a fist. “I beat Stranger-Come-Knocking there! Carved him all to hell.”\n“And from what I heard, it was a fight for the songs.” Though what\nClover actually heard was that Stranger-Come-Knocking got old and slow\nand lived past his reputation, a tragedy that befalls every great fighter not\nkilled in his prime. “But each time you step into the Circle, you balance\nyour life on a sword’s edge. Sooner or later, it won’t fall your way.”\nStour’s young warriors scoffed like they never heard aught so\ncontemptible as this eminent good sense. “Did Black Dow fear the Circle?”\nsneered Greenway.\n“Or Whirrun of Bligh, or Shama Heartless, or Rudd Threetrees?” asked\nMagweer.\nWonderful rolled her eyes.

He beat the\nFeared and he stole your grandfather’s chain. But what did it get him? He\nlost everything, made nothing, and time’ll just hand that chain to you.\nWho’d want to be like that bastard?”\nStour opened his arms wide, opened his eyes wide, put on the big act.\n“The only chain I want is a chain of blood!” Made not the slightest sense.\nHow could you make a chain out of blood anyway?

If someone’s fixed on feuding, I’ve come to realise there’s only\ntwo realistic options.” Clover wriggled back against the trunk until he found\na comfortable position. “First, you just float over it, like dandelion seeds on\na stiff breeze, and pay it no mind at all.”\n“Second?”\n“Murder the bastard.” Clover grinned up at the blue sky, where the sun\nwas starting to finally show some warmth. “But I wouldn’t want to spoil\nsuch a wonderful afternoon with murder, would you?”\n“It’d be a shame, I’ll admit.” Wonderful watched Clover as he stretched\nout and crossed his legs. “What are you doing?”\n“What we should all be doing.” Clover closed his eyes. “Biding my\ntime.”\n“What’s the difference between biding it and wasting it?”\nClover saw no need to open his eyes. “Results, woman.

So why fight him with your hands?”\nLeo started unbuttoning his own shirt. “When I lived in Uffrith, the\nDogman used to tell me stories about the Bloody-Nine. The duels he won in\nthe Circle. I loved those stories. Used to dance around the garden behind his\nhall with a stick, pretending I was Ninefingers and the laundry post was\nRudd Threetrees, or Black Dow, or Fenris the Feared.” There was still a\nthrill in saying the names. Like they were magic words.\nJurand watched Glaward loose a few brutal practice punches. “The\nlaundry post won’t knock your teeth out.”\nLeo tossed his shirt over Jurand’s head. “A champion never knows what\nhe’ll have to fight with. That’s why I always let you bastards pick the\nweapons.” It was a cold morning, so he started bouncing on his toes to get\nthe blood moving. “That’s why I beat Barniva with a heavy sword, and\nAntaup with a spear. Why I beat Whitewater Jin with a mace and you with\nlong and short steels. That’s why I test my archery against Ritter. Used to,\nthat is.” The poor dead fool. “But I never yet beat Glaward with my bare\nhands.”\n“Well, no,” said Jurand, that worried crease between his brows. “He’s\nbuilt like a barn.”\n“The bigger they are—”\n“The harder they hit?”\n“Your defeats teach you more than your victories,” muttered Leo, trying\nto slap some warmth into his muscles.\n“They hurt more, too.” Jurand dropped his voice a little. “At least tell\nme you’ll fight dirty.”\n“With honour or not at all,” grunted Leo. He thought Casamir the\nSteadfast might have said it in a storybook once. “Whose side are you on,\nanyway?”\n“Yours.” Jurand looked a little hurt by the question. “Always. We all are.\nThat’s why I won’t enjoy seeing him choke you unconscious.”\nLeo narrowed his eyes. “What I need from my second is belief.”\nSinew popped from Glaward’s arms as he raised his fists. Leo couldn’t\ndeny it was a majestic sight. Like some piece of exaggerated statuary. Even\nhis teeth looked muscular. “I’m going to squeeze you out like a lemon,” he\ngrowled.\n“The Young Lemon!” barked Barniva, to much merriment from the\nonlookers.\nJurand leaned close. “If you die, can I have your horse?”\n“Belief,” growled Leo, and dashed forward. Attack, always attack.\nEspecially when the odds are against you.\nHe caught Glaward off guard, ducked under a wild fist, the wind of it\ncatching his hair, and gave the big man the heaviest punches to the body he\ncould. No doubt Glaward was carrying a little fat, but any hope he was soft\nunderneath was long gone. Leo felt as if he’d punched a tree.\n“Shit,” he hissed through his fixed smile, shaking out his throbbing\nfingers.\n“I’m going to make you eat this hillside,” growled Glaward, and the\ngrowing audience whooped and laughed."

The\nolder had a sharp, expressionless face, mouth twisted by a scar, trouser-leg\nslit open showing bandages underneath. The younger had a wide, almost\nover-expressive face, a thick gold ring through her broad, freckled nose and\na tangle of red-brown hair so wild those behind had to lean around it to see.\n“This is manly,” she said, propping a muddy boot on the rail of the\nfence, its tongue flopping from bodged laces. “Do they charge for the\nspectacle?”\n“Far as I can tell,” mused the old one, “they take their clothes off for\nfree.”\nThe young one spread her arms and gave a huge smile. “What a public-\nspirited thing to do!”\nGlaward was in no mood to give anything away. He kept pressing\nforward, one big fist flicking out in lethal-looking jabs. Leo dodged one,\nand another, but the third glanced his cheek and sent him staggering. He\nslipped on the wet grass, luckily, since Glaward’s other fist lashed the air\nwhere his head had just been. He slid around the big man, gave him a\npetulant tap in the ribs as he passed to no effect at all.\nGlaward gave a scornful snort. “Are we fighting or dancing?”\nOver his heavy shoulder, Leo caught sight of the girl again, staring\ncross-eyed at a strand of hair in her face. She stuck her bottom lip out to\nblow it away, and it flopped straight back in her eyes along with three\nothers. There was something familiar about her, like a name on the tip of his\ntongue.\n“We’re fighting!” he snarled, and ducked in with a flurry of punches,\nteeth bared and spit flying.\n“That’s it!” he heard Jurand shout. “Give him hell!”\nBut Leo’s best efforts slapped harmlessly against Glaward’s big arms,\nscuffed the top of his head, bounced from his sides. Then a heavy fist came\nfrom nowhere, caught Leo under the chin and sent him tottering. He\nwhooped helplessly as he was hauled into the air by his belt.\nDark land and bright sky reeled, he flailed wildly, then the ground struck\nhim hard in the side, rattled his teeth, tumbled him over and over and onto\nhis face.\nHe gave a long groan as he dragged himself up and saw Glaward’s great\nboot already rushing to meet him. He gasped as he rolled away, the big heel\ndigging a great divot from the turf. He scrambled to his feet, lost his\nbalance and fell against the fence.\n“This blond one is pretty,” the older woman was saying.\n“I have eyes.” The young one was watching him with her chin propped\non her hands, head bouncing as she chewed something. She certainly did\nhave eyes. Big, and very pale, and very piercing.\n“He’s like a hunting dog, all fierce and frisky.”"

Big, and very pale, and very piercing.\n“He’s like a hunting dog, all fierce and frisky.”\nLeo didn’t feel too frisky as Glaward’s fists came at him again. He\ncovered up but the force in them was fearsome. A punch in the side\nslammed him against the fence and drove his breath out, a knuckle caught\nhis jaw and turned his mouth salty.\n“Get out of there!” he heard Jurand shout over his own gurgling, rasping\nbreath.\nHe only just ducked a blow that would’ve knocked him right over the\nfence and shoved Glaward away with all his strength. The big man barely\nmoved, but Leo bounced off at least, staggering clear of the fence with his\nface throbbing, lungs burning, knees wobbling.\nGlaward could’ve knocked him down with a pointed finger. But he was\nfixed on milking his moment, throwing his great fists in the air, strutting\nlike a cock in his own farmyard.\n“Hit him!” Jurand hooted over the crowd. “Bloody hit him!”\nBut it was clear Leo would never beat Glaward with his fists. He had to\nbeat him with his head. He thought, through the fog, of what his mother\nwould’ve said. Less courage, more judgement. Putting their worst troops on\nshow in the valley, marching as badly as they could. Even as his head\ncleared, he shook it as if he could hardly see straight, clutched at his ribs as\nif he could hardly get a breath. Even as the strength returned to his legs, he\nput on a drunken stagger.\n“Are we fight?” he gurgled, showing his bloody teeth. “Or dance?”\nHe’d have won no laurels for his acting but Glaward was blessed with\nmore muscle than imagination. He charged in with no caution at all,\nreadying a punch they’d be talking about for years. But Leo had his wits\nback. He dropped under it, rolled smoothly, caught Glaward’s big calf on\nthe way past and sprang up, pulling the leg with him.\nGlaward grunted with surprise, hopped once, waving his arms for\nbalance, then his other foot slid from under him and he came crashing down\non his face.\n“Now who’s eating the hillside?” crowed Leo. Glaward clawed\nhelplessly at the turf, snapping and snarling, but Leo had Glaward’s huge\nboot in a lock against his chest and wasn’t letting go. “How does it taste?”\nLeo twisted harder and the big man slapped at the ground. “All right!\nI’m done! I’m done!”\nLeo let the boot fall and tottered back. He felt Jurand catch his wrist and\nlift his arm high.\n“A victory for reasonably sized men everywhere!” he shouted, draping\nLeo’s shirt over his shoulder.\n“Don’t get dressed on our account,” called the older woman, and the\nyounger threw her head back and gave a gurgling laugh.\n“Leo!” someone shouted. One of the few optimistic enough to bet on\nhim, probably. He tried to grin through the considerable pain. Was one of\nhis teeth loose? “The Young Lion!”\nThe girl was frowning straight at him. “You’re Leo dan Brock?”"

She steered me home.”\n“As a great sea captain steers a leaky skiff, d’you see?” The older\nwoman’s scar twisted the corner of her mouth and made her look like she\nhad a constant frown. Or maybe she was constantly frowning. “I’m quite\nthe hero, but let’s not make too much of it.”\n“Black Calder’s bastards were everywhere. And his son Stour fucking\nNightfall.” Rikke bared her teeth in a burst of fury so sudden, Leo nearly\nstepped back. “I’ll see that prick back to the mud, I promise you!” And she\nspat, left a long string of it dangling from her lip and dashed it away.\n“Bastards.”\n“But… you’re not hurt?”\nRikke stuck her fists in Leo’s face and pushed a finger up for each point.\n“I’ve been starved, slapped, pissed on, shot at, chased by dogs, threatened\nwith being fucked by a pig, slept under a hanged man, near fell down a\ngorge, killed a boy and shat myself, so, you know,” and she shrugged, head\nfalling to one side and her shoulders right up around her ears, “I’m hoping\nnext week’ll be easier going, let’s say that.”\n“Sounds… trying.” He hardly knew what she was talking about, but he\nliked hearing her talk. “It’s good to see you again.” He meant it. They’d\nbeen close once. As close as you could be, with someone as strange as she’d\nbeen.\n“You remember the first time we met?” she asked.\nLeo winced. “Hard to forget.”\n“You mocked my twitching and my foolish hair and my unusual way.”\n“Eager to prove myself in front of the boys.”\nShe nodded towards Glaward, who was sitting on the hillside rubbing at\nhis twisted ankle. “Some things never change.”\n“If it helps, I’m not proud of it.”\n“It helped when I knocked you down and sat on you.”"

And you were half a head taller than me.”\nHe drew himself up, looking down at her from as far above now as she’d\nlooked down on him then. “Doubt you’d try it now.”\n“Oh, I don’t know.” She reached out and wiped the blood from his top\nlip with her thumb. Maybe her eye twitched. Or maybe she winked right at\nhim. “I might be persuaded.”\n“Better’n being fucked by a pig, I reckon,” said Isern-i-Phail, grunting\nsoftly as she lifted her bandaged leg from the fence and turned hobbling\naway. “I need to steer this leaky skiff back to her father before she drifts off\ncourse again. I gave my word!”\n“I am in much demand.” Rikke backed away, gave a bow that left one\nhand brushing the turf, then slipped up onto the rail of the fence. “See you\nlater, little Leo.” And she swung her boots over it and swaggered off,\nleaving Leo staring after her.\n“My, my, my.” Antaup had appeared, as he often did when women were\naround, sucking air through pursed lips as he watched Rikke go. “Who’s the\nbeauty with the ring through her nose?”\n“Three mys?” murmured Jurand, drily. “Virtually a proposal of\nmarriage.”\n“That,” said Leo, “was Rikke.”\n“The Dogman’s missing daughter?”\n“We used to be close when I was in Uffrith. She’s… grown.”\n“In all the right places,” said Antaup. “Those eyes, though.”\n“Don’t they say she can see the future?” asked Jurand, looking less than\nconvinced.\nBarniva’s whisper was full of laughter in Leo’s ear. “I’ve a suspicion she\nsees your cock in it.”\nJurand turned away, shaking his head. “For pity’s sake…” He was a\ngreat friend, and damned clever, but he could be a hell of a prude.\n“Careful.” Leo threw his arm around Barniva’s neck and pulled him into\na headlock. “I might have to make you eat the hillside next.”\n“Well, if you’d rather wrestle…” Antaup licked his finger and thumb and\ngave that loose curl at the front of his hair a little tweak. “It’d be a shame to\nleave such a promising field unploughed…”\nIt was then Leo made up his mind that he was interested. Antaup knew\nall about women. If he was impressed, everyone would be.\n“Keep your plough to yourself.” He caught Antaup with his free arm and\ndragged him into the good-natured tussle, giving Rikke’s backside the same\nsort of hungry grin his friends were giving it. “And stay off my land.”\nQuestions\nS\nhe thought Tallow was in the room on her left.

Grise was on her right. Vick had heard her\nscreaming insults. Then just screaming. No questions yet, though. Softening\nher up. Vick wondered how soft she was, now.\nStrange how quick you lose track of time when you can’t see the sky.\nJust the windowless white room, too brightly lit, and the table with two\nchairs and three bloodstains, and the door. Was it hours since they were\ncaught, or days? She might’ve dozed a while. Jerked awake with the sweat\ncold on her bare skin to hear someone begging in the corridor outside. But\nthe door had stayed closed. They’d stripped her, and chained her to the\nchair, and left her there, gradually aching more and more to piss.\nShe was wondering whether she should just piss where she sat when the\ndoor opened.\nA man came in. Or was brought in. He sat in a strange chair on wheels,\npushed by a Practical of monstrous size. He was silver-haired, his skin\nalmost as pale as his spotless white coat and deeply lined, as if stretched too\ntight over the bones. His face was twisted, left eye twitchily narrowed. On\nhis little finger he wore a ring of office with a great purple stone, but even\nwithout it there was no mistaking him.\nOld Sticks. The Cripple. The King’s Skinner. The axle around which the\nClosed Council turned. His Eminence, Arch Lector Glokta.\n“I like your chair,” said Vick as it squeaked to a halt on the other side of\nthe table.\nThe Arch Lector raised one brow. “I don’t. But walking pains me more\nevery year and my daughter tells me there is no nobility in suffering. She\nprevailed upon her friend Master Curnsbick to make it for me.”\n“The great machinist himself?”\n“I hear he is a genius.” Glokta glanced up at the vast Practical looming\nover him, the chair’s handles lost in his immensity of fist. “Now a useless\nman can render a useful man useless wheeling him around. There’s\nprogress, eh? Remove her restraints, please.”\n“Your Eminence?” came muffled from behind the Practical’s mask.\n“Come, come, we are not animals.”\nThe Practical took a little wedge from his pocket, knelt and slipped it\nunder one of the chair’s wheels with surprising daintiness. Then he\nlumbered around the table, manacles digging into Vick’s skin as he\nunlocked them. Her wrists were chafed raw, but she made sure not to rub\nthem. Made sure not to wince or flinch or stretch or groan. Not even when\nshe put her hands on the table and saw Sibalt’s blood still crusted under the\nnails. Show hurt, you’re asking to be hurt. She’d learned that lesson in the\ncamps. Learned it hard.\nArch Lector Glokta watched her, the trace of a smile on his twisted face,\nas though he guessed her every thought. “And the clothes, please.”\nThe Practical unhappily placed a neatly folded shirt and pair of trousers"

The latch dropped with a final-\nsounding click, leaving her alone in that bare, white room with the most\nfeared man in the Union.\n“So.” He showed the yawning gap in his front teeth as he smiled. “It\nseems congratulations are in order again, Inquisitor Teufel. Ever so neatly\ndone. I knew my confidence in you was not misplaced.”\n“Thank you, Your Eminence.”\n“Shall I turn my back while you dress?” He squinted down at the wheels\nof his chair. “I’m afraid it can take a while. Nowhere near so nimble as in\nmy youth. I won the Contest without conceding a touch, you know—”\nShe made her own chair squeal as she stood, ignoring the ache in her\nstiff hip. “Don’t worry.” And she shook the shirt out and started pulling it\non.\nYou strip a prisoner to make them feel vulnerable. Make them feel\nthey’ve nowhere they can hide a secret. But it only works if you let it. Vick\nmade sure she dressed just the way she would have if she was alone. When\nyou grow up in the camps, sleeping beside strangers, sharing their warmth,\ntheir stink, their lice, hosed down in a cringing pack by the guards when the\nsickness comes through, modesty is a luxury you soon learn to live without.\n“I can only apologise that it took me so long to reach you,” said His\nEminence, as unmoved by her nakedness as she was. “The government is in\nuproar over this fighting in the North. Did we get them all?”\n“All except Sibalt. He…” Vick kept her face carefully expressionless as\nshe thought of him ramming the blade into his neck. “He killed himself\nrather than be captured.”\n“Unfortunate. I know the two of you had become… involved.”\nThe Arch Lector found out everything, of course. But it was as if his\nsaying it, his knowing it, made it real. The feeling took her by surprise. She\nhad to stop buttoning her shirt, look at the floor with her teeth gritted, stay\nsilent in case her voice gave her away. Just for a moment. Then she carried\non fastening the buttons with her blood-crusted fingers, mask back on. “Is\nthat a problem, Your Eminence?”\n“Not for me. We all yearn for a simple world, but people are imperfect,\nunpredictable, contradictory beasts with sympathies, and needs, and\nfeelings. Even people like us.”\n“Feelings didn’t come in to it,” said Vick, pulling on the trousers.\nShe had a sense he saw through her. “If they did not, you have\ndemonstrated your commitment. If they did, you have gone one better and\ndemonstrated your loyalty.”"

They just want a little more.”\n“I thought feelings did not come into it?” The Arch Lector’s left eye had\nstarted to weep, and he pulled out a white handkerchief and gently dabbed\nit. “You grew up in the camps, Inquisitor Teufel.”\n“You know I did, Your Eminence.”\n“You have seen humanity in the raw.”\n“About as raw as it gets, Your Eminence.”\n“So tell me. These good people. If they get a little more, what will they\nwant then?”\nVick paused a moment, but there was nothing else to say. “A little\nmore.”\n“Because that is the nature of people. And their little more must be taken\nfrom someone else, and that someone else will be less than delighted. One\ncannot eliminate unhappiness any more than one can eliminate darkness.\nThe goal of government, you see,” and the Arch Lector prodded at the air\nwith his bony forefinger, “is to load the unhappiness onto those least able to\nmake you suffer for it.”\n“What if you misjudge who can make you suffer?”\n“Misjudgement is as much a part of life as unhappiness. It is nice to hold\nthe power and make the choices for everyone. But the risk of making any\nchoice is always that you might make the wrong one. We must make our\nchoices nonetheless. Fear of being a grown-up is a poor reason to remain a\nchild.”\n“Of course, Your Eminence.” There’s only so much you can do. Then\nyou move on. The camps had taught her that lesson, too.\n“Where did they get the Gurkish Fire?”\n“They spoke of friends in Valbeck.”\n“More Breakers?”\n“A more organised group, perhaps. They mentioned the Weaver.”\nGlokta gave no reaction to the name. But then he buried his feelings\neven more deeply than Vick did. If he still had any. However hard the\ncamps, they were soft beside the place where he learned his lessons.\n“Valbeck is a large city,” he said, “and growing every day. New mills.\nNew slums. But it is somewhere to start. I shall ask your friends about their\nfriends in Valbeck, and see if we can learn any more about this… Weaver.”\nJust one more try, maybe. Vick sat forward, clasping her hands. “With\nyour permission—I think the boy Tallow might be turned.”\n“You can ensure his loyalty?”\n“He has a sister.

If he might kick and scratch and go wild. But he was\ntoo clever or too scared. He just looked down at the stained tabletop and\nsaid, “Oh.”\n“Do you know who I was just talking to, next door?”\nTallow slowly shook his head.\n“His Eminence the Arch Lector.”\nThose eyes went even bigger. “Here?”\n“In his crippled person.

My guess is your friend Grise will already be telling\nhim everything she knows about everything.”\n“She’s strong,” he said.\n“No, she’s not. But it doesn’t matter. Once you’re stripped and alone and\nhe starts cutting, there’s no strong that’s strong enough.”\nTallow blinked, tears glistening in his eyes. “But she’s—”\n“Put her out of your mind.

He’d have to see about getting a new\none for the campaign. “All I need now is the men.”\nBrint looked around. “Pardon me?”\n“My father has promised me a battalion of the King’s Own, as well as\nhis First Guard, Bremer dan Gorst, who I understand is worth a company\nhimself,” and he gave a laugh which Brint by no means returned, “but I do\nrequire… somewhere in the region of, well, five thousand more?”\nSilence stretched out.\n“You don’t have the men?” hissed Brint, spit flecking from his lips.\n“Well… that’s why I’ve come to you, Lord Marshal. I mean to say…\nyou’re a lord marshal.” Orso winced. “Aren’t you?”\nBrint took a deep breath and regained command of himself. “I am, Your\nHighness, and I apologise. I find it difficult to keep my perspective where\nthese Northmen are concerned.” He frowned down at a ring on his little\nfinger, pushed at it with his thumb-tip. A lady’s ring, by the look of it, with a\nyellow stone. “Lost a wife to the savages, as well as two close friends. Not\nto mention a bloody arm.”\n“No need for apologies, Lord Marshal, I entirely understand.”\n“I hope you don’t think that I resent your entirely reasonable request. I\napplaud it.” Brint snorted, glancing towards his empty sleeve. “Or would,\nhad I the equipment. I’m just embarrassed that I cannot give you the men,\nand ashamed not to have sent help to the lady governor already. Several\nregiments were disbanded following the war in Styria and what remains is\nspread thin. The rebellion in Starikland never ends.” He waved the arm he"

The rebellion in Starikland never ends.” He waved the arm he\nhad towards another map. “And now there’s widespread unrest among the\npeasantry in Midderland. These bloody Breakers, curse them, making\nhumble folk dissatisfied with their place in the world. Honestly, I’m\nconcerned about the battalion your father has already promised you. There’s\nnot the slightest possibility of my recruiting more without additional funds\nfrom the lord chancellor.”\n“Hmmm.” Orso sat back, arms folded. It seemed, like most things in\nlife, this was going to be a great deal more difficult than he had hoped. “It’s\na question of money, then?”\n“Your Highness,” and Lord Marshal Brint gave a sigh that bespoke an\ninfinite weariness, “it is always a question of money.”\n“Lord Chancellor Gorodets, thank you for seeing me at such short notice. I\nknow you must be a very busy man.”\n“I am, Your Highness.”\nThere was a pregnant pause, during which the lord chancellor gazed\nlevelly at Orso over the top of his gold-rimmed eye-lenses. He was a toad of\na man with a taste for rich sauces, his many chins swelling expansively over\nhis fur collar. Orso wished, not for the first time that day, that he was a great\ndeal more drunk. But if he was to prevail against the impenetrable\nmachinery of state, he would need every faculty.\n“Let me get straight to the point, then,” he said. “I am eager—as I am\nsure every right-thinking man in the Union must be—to rush to the aid of\nour hard-pressed brothers and sisters in Angland.”\nGorodets gave a grimace of almost physical pain. “A war.”\n“Well, yes, but one forced upon us—”\n“Those are no cheaper, Your Highness.”\n“No cheaper?” muttered Orso.\n“Over the past twenty years, your father—encouraged by Her Majesty\nQueen Terez—has fought three wars in Styria for the sake of your\nbirthright, the Grand Duchy of Talins.”\n“I wish he’d asked my opinion.” Orso gave what he hoped was a\ndisarming chuckle. “I scarcely want one nation, let alone two.”\n“That is just as well, Your Highness, since the Union lost all three wars.”\n“Come now, couldn’t we call that middle one a draw?”\n“We could, but I doubt anyone who fought in it would agree, and from a\nfinancial standpoint, victories are hardly to be preferred. To pay for those\nwars, I have been obliged to impose stringent taxes on the peasantry, on the\nmerchants, on the provinces and, finally, with great reluctance, on the\nnobles. The nobles, in response, have consolidated their holdings, turned\ntenants off their estates and passed laws in the Open Council seizing and\nenclosing common land. People have flooded from the country into the\ncities and upset the whole system of taxation entirely. The Crown has been\nobliged to borrow heavily. More heavily, I should say.

The debts owed to\nthe banking house of Valint and Balk alone are…” Gorodets spent a\nmoment scouring his vocabulary for a word of sufficient scale, and finally\ngave up. “Difficult to describe. Between the two of us, just the interest\nrepresents a significant proportion of the nation’s expenditure.”\n“That much?”\n“More. It is a thoroughly parlous situation, with acrimony boiling in\nevery quarter. To find additional funds now is… unthinkable.”\nOrso listened with mounting horror. “Lord Chancellor, all I am asking\nfor is the money for five thousand soldiers—”\n“All, Your Highness?” Gorodets looked over his lenses like a tutor at a\ndisappointing pupil, a look unpleasantly familiar to Orso from his actual\ntutors. Anyone in a position of authority, come to think of it. “Are you\naware of how great a sum that is?”\nOrso restrained his mounting frustration. “But you must see we have to\ndo something about these Northmen!”\n“I am afraid what I see is beside the point, Your Highness. I am a\nglorified accountant, and not even that glorified.” He waved a hand at his\ncavernous office, every surface panelled with marble or encrusted with gold\nleaf, the plaster-cast faces of his predecessors gazing down smugly from up\nnear the ceiling. “I manage the books. I try to make sure that what goes out\nin expenditure is equalled by what comes in through taxation. In this, like\nevery lord chancellor before me, I habitually fail. It may be given to me to\nhold the purse strings but… I do not set policy alone.”\n“Alone?”\nThe lord chancellor gave a mirthless little chuckle as he wiped his lenses\nwith a corner of his fur robe and held them up to the light. “I barely set\npolicy at all.”\n“Who does?”\n“It is His Eminence Arch Lector Glokta who takes the lead in setting the\npriorities of the Closed Council.”\nOrso sagged unhappily back into his chair. He remembered now why he\nhad abandoned government and channelled his energies into women and\nwine. “It’s a question of priorities, then?”\n“Your Highness,” and the lord chancellor perched his lenses back on his\nnose, “it is always a question of priorities.”\n“Your Eminence,” said Orso. “Thank you so much for seeing me at such\nshort notice. I know you must be a very busy man.”\n“To you, Your Highness, my door stands always open.”\n“Must cause a hell of a draught!” Arch Lector Glokta produced a false\nsmile, displaying that hideous gap in his teeth. Orso wondered yet again\nhow this monstrous remnant of a man could have had a hand in producing\nsomething so altogether magnificent as his daughter. “I wish to talk to you\nabout the unfortunate situation in the North—”\n“I would not call it unfortunate.”\n“You wouldn’t?”\n“Scale Ironhand, his brother Black Calder and his son Stour Nightfall\nhave invaded our Protectorate and burned the capital of our long-standing\nally. That is not misfortune. That is a calculated act of war.”\n“That’s worse.”\n“Far worse.”\n“We should chastise these invaders, then!” said Orso, whacking his fist"

That is a calculated act of war.”\n“That’s worse.”\n“Far worse.”\n“We should chastise these invaders, then!” said Orso, whacking his fist\ninto his open palm.\n“We should.” Though something in the way the Arch Lector said\n“should” suggested he didn’t think they would.\nOrso paused, wondering how to frame it, but straightforward was\nusually best. “I wish to lead the expedition against them.”\n“Then I applaud your patriotic sentiments, Your Highness.” To give\nGlokta his due, he showed not the slightest trace of mockery. “But this is a\nmilitary matter. Perhaps you should raise it with Lord Marshal Brint—”\n“I did. He led me by a roundabout route to Lord Chancellor Gorodets,\nwho led me by a roundabout route to you. I followed the power, you might\nsay, to your door.” And he grinned. “Which stands always open to me.”\nThe Arch Lector’s narrow left eye twitched and Orso inwardly cursed.\nThese flourishes of cleverness never did him the slightest good. He would\nget further with powerful men if they thought they were indulging an idiot.\nThey probably were, after all.\n“My father has given me leave to go,” he went on. “Lord Marshal Brint\ncan supply the officers. What I am lacking are the men. Or, more precisely,\nthe money to pay and outfit them. Five thousand of the blighters, to be\nprecise.”\nHis Eminence sat back and regarded Orso with those sunken, feverishly\nbright eyes. Not a pleasant gaze to endure, by any means. Orso was glad he\nhad only to endure it here, on the ground floor of the House of Questions,\nand not below.\n“Do you know my daughter, Your Highness?”\nA chilly breeze drifted through the Arch Lector’s stark, hard office then,\nmaking the great heaps of papers on the tables shift and crackle like restless\nspirits. For a moment, Orso found himself wondering how many of them\nwere the confessions of guilty traitors. Or innocent ones. But he was\ndecidedly pleased with the way he kept his face blank, despite the sudden\nsurge of guilty horror, not to mention healthy fear, produced by the\nquestion. Orso might not have excelled in all the areas his mother would\nhave liked, but at feigning ignorance he was a master. Perhaps because he\nhad so much real ignorance to draw on.\n“Your daughter… Sarene, is it?”\n“Savine.”\n“Savine, of course. I believe we’ve met… somewhere.” Indeed, his\ntongue had met her quim and her mouth his cock not long ago and they had\nall got on bloody famously. He cleared his throat, aware of a swelling in his\ntrousers by no means appropriate during a meeting with the most feared\nman in the Union. “Charming girl… as I recall.”\n“Do you know what she does?”\n“Does?” Orso was starting to wonder if His Eminence had found out all\nabout their little arrangement, in spite of the exhaustive precautions Savine\ninsisted on. He was a man whose job it was to find things out, after all, and\nhe was very, very good at his job. And that was not the sum of his job. Orso"

Orso\nwas confident the heir to the throne would not be bobbing to the surface of a\ncanal any time soon, bloated by seawater and horribly mutilated, but… the\nArch Lector would be a bad man to upset. The worst. “Young ladies do a lot\nof sewing, I understand?”\n“She is an investor,” said Glokta.\nOrso played the dunce, waving one hand so his lace cuff flapped about\nthe fingers. “A kind of… merchant?”\n“A merchant in inventions. Machines. Manufactories. Better ways of\ndoing things. She buys ideas and makes them real.”\nOrso could not, in fact, have been more awed and mystified by what\nSavine did if she had been a magus practising High Art, but he thought it\nmight suit the role better if he barked out a mildly contemptuous laugh.\n“How thoroughly…modern.”\n“Thoroughly modern. In my youth, for someone to make a considerable\nfortune in that way, let alone a woman, would have been unthinkable.\nSavine may be a pioneer, but there are others following. We are entering a\nnew age, Your Highness.”\n“We are?”\n“My daughter recently helped finance the building of a large mill near\nKeln.” And His Eminence pointed with one pale, knobbly finger across the\nmap of the Union carved into the tabletop between them, towards what\nlooked like nothing so much as an old, stained nail mark. “In that mill is a\nmachine, operated by one man and powered by a waterwheel, that can card\nas much wool in a day as nine men could the old way.”\n“I suppose that’s a fine thing for the wool trade?” offered Orso, baffled.\n“It is. A fine thing for my daughter and her partners, too. But it is not so\nfine a thing for those other eight men, who used to card wool and are now\nlooking for a new way to feed their families.”\n“I suppose not.”\n“And the very clever man who came up with that machine—a Gurkish\nrefugee by the name of Masrud—has just come up with another that spins\nthe carded wool into thread. Each one of those puts six women out of work.\nAnd they’re not happy about it.”\n“Arch Lector, fascinated though I am by your daughter’s exploits,” and\nhe bloody was, he was having to cross his legs at the thought of her to\nprevent embarrassment, “I’m not sure how they relate to our Northern\ntroubles—”\n“Change, Your Highness. At a pace and of a kind that has never been\nseen before. An order that has stood for centuries buckles and twists.\nTraditional barriers, however we might try to shore them up, collapse like\nsandcastles before the tide. Men fear to lose what they have, covet what\nthey do not. It is a time of chaos. Of fear.” The Arch Lector shrugged,\ntentatively, as though even that gave him pain. “A time of opportunity, if\nyou are as clever as my daughter, but a time of great danger, too.

Every night,\nworkers with soot-smeared faces cause wanton damage to machinery. In\nHocksted, yesterday morning, the funeral of an agitator devolved into a full-\nscale riot.”\n“Ah.”\n“Below us, in the cells, are members of the group called the Breakers,\napprehended only last night in the act of blowing up a foundry not two\nmiles from where we sit. We are even now persuading them to help us\nuproot a conspiracy that spans the breadth of the nation.”\nOrso’s eyes rolled down towards the floor. “That sounds… bad.” He\nwasn’t sure whether he was thinking of the plot or the fate of the plotters.\nPerhaps both.\n“There is disloyalty everywhere. Treason everywhere. People love to say\nthat things have never been so bad—”\nOrso smiled. “They do, they do.”\n“But things really have never been so bad.”\nOrso’s smile vanished. “Ah.”\n“I wish we were free to do what we thought right. I truly do.” The Arch\nLector glanced up at a huge, dark portrait on the wall. Some fearsome bald\nbureaucrat of the past, glowering down watchfully upon the little people.\nZoller, maybe. “But we simply cannot risk any overseas adventures,\nhowever well intentioned, however deeply desired, however apparently\nnecessary.” He clasped his long, thin hands and gazed levelly at Orso, eyes\nglittering in skull-like sockets. “Put simply, the government of the Union\nhangs by a thread and must look first to its own security. To the legacy of\nthe king. To the position of his heir.”\n“Well, I wouldn’t want to interfere with your making his position\ncomfortable.” Orso gave a helpless shrug. He was quite out of ideas. “It’s a\nquestion of politics, then?”\n“Your Highness,” and Arch Lector Glokta smiled, once again displaying\nthat yawning gap in his front teeth. “It is always a question of politics.”\nOrso shuffled through his hand again, but it was as awful as it had been\nwhen it was dealt.\n“I fold,” he grunted, tossing his cards down in disgust. “What a pig of a\nday. Makes you wonder how anything gets done.”\n“Or realise why nothing does,” said Tunny as he raked in the pot.\n“It gives me scant enthusiasm for the job of being king, that’s sure.”\n“Not that you had much in the first place.”\n“No. One begins to understand why my father is… how he is.”\n“Ineffectual, you mean?” Yolk chuckled. “He must be the most ineffec\n—”\nOrso grabbed a fistful of his shirt and dragged him half out of his chair.\n“I get to mock him,” he snarled in Yolk’s shocked face. “You fucking\ndon’t.”\n“There’s no point bullying that idiot,” said Tunny, managing to smoke a"

It was every bit as awful as the last. But perhaps\ngood card players are the ones who can win with bad cards.\n“Forget those old bastards in the government.” Tunny pointed at Orso\nwith the stem of his pipe. “They’ve no vision. No audacity. We need to look\nat this another way. We need to frame it as a bet.” And he tossed a couple of\nsilvers into the empty centre of the table. “You need someone with money.\nWith ambition. With patience. Someone who’ll see a few favours from you\ndown the line as a solid gamble.”\n“Won’t be me,” said Yolk, sadly, tossing his hand away.\n“Rich, ambitious and patient,” mused Orso, frowning at those two\nglinting coins. “A gamble. Or… an investment? Pass me that pencil.” And\nOrso scrawled a few words across one of his playing cards, folded it and\nheld it out. “Could you take this to the usual place, Hildi?” And he gave her\na meaningful waggle of the brows. “An invitation to Sworbreck’s office.\nTen bits in it if you’re quick.”\n“Twenty and it’ll be there yesterday,” said Hildi, hopping off the settle\nand sticking her chin up at him as though it was a loaded flatbow and she a\nhighwayman.\n“Twenty it is, you bandit. How much do I owe you now?”\n“Seventeen marks and eight bits.”\n“Already?”\n“I’m never wrong about numbers,” she said solemnly.\n“She’s never wrong about numbers,” said Tunny, shifting his chagga\npipe from one side of his mouth to the other using only tongue and teeth.\n“She is never wrong about numbers,” said Orso, counting out the coins.\nHildi snatched them from his hand, stuck them into her cap, twisted it\ndown hard onto her mass of blonde curls and slipped out through the door\nnimbly as a cat.\n“How’re we going to play with a card missing?” grumbled Yolk.\n“You manage it without looks, wits or money,” said Orso, sorting\nthrough his hand again. “You can manage without one card.”\nSore Spots\n“H\now the hell did you get that bruise?”\nSavine put her fingers to her mouth.

Then dinner with the loose-tongued but\ntight-fisted Tilde dan Rucksted and her husband. An opportunity to discuss\ntheir investment in Master Kort’s canal.”\nSavine’s turn to sigh. Another of the lord marshal’s tales of derring-do\non the frontier and she might be obliged to drown herself in the canal rather\nthan extend it. But business was business.\nSavine’s mother was pouring herself another glass of wine. “What is it,\ndarling?”\n“I have to dress for dinner.”\n“Now?” She stuck her lip out in a needy pout. “How bloody tiresome.

Metello—a hatchet-featured Styrian who had once\nbeen chief dresser to the Duchess of Affoia—barely spoke a word of\ncommon but expressed herself with unmatched eloquence through the\nmedium of wigs. Zuri, meanwhile, attended to book and jewels and ensured\nthat the others did not make a mess of anything all at once.\n“Master Tardiche writes to say the foundry cannot be competitive\nwithout another five thousand marks for new machinery,” she said, meeting\nSavine’s eye in the mirror.\nSavine frowned. “I did not care for the way he spoke to me last time he\nvisited. Great tall fellow, declaiming from on high.” She lifted her chin so\nLisbit could lean in, different shades of powder smeared on the back of her\nhand like an easel, and set to work on her eyelids with the tip of a little\nfinger. “Let him know I am selling my share. If he comes grovelling, I\nmight reconsider.” She gasped as Freid gave another tug at her corset and\nnear dragged her off her feet. “Some men just look better on their knees.\nTighter, Freid.”\n“Everyone looks better on their knees. It was my favourite thing about\nattending temple.” Zuri set the book down to step in, winding the laces tight\naround her hands and pushing one knee into Savine’s back. “Breathe out.”\nSavine’s lungs were emptied in a faint groan as Zuri pulled. She might\nhave been slender as a willow switch but, by the Fates, she was strong as a\ndocker. The feeling of constriction was, for a moment, quite terrifying. But\ngreat results require great pains.\nPeople liked to think of beauty as some natural gift, but Savine firmly\nbelieved that just about anyone could be beautiful, if they worked hard at it\nand spent enough money. It was merely a question of emphasising the good,\ndisguising the bad and painfully squeezing the average into the most\nimpressive configuration. Very much like business, really.\n“That’s it, Zuri,” croaked Savine, shifting her shoulders back and letting\neverything settle. “Unless you feel like it’s cutting you in half, it isn’t doing\nthe job. Knots, Freid, before they loosen.”\n“Master Hisselring called.” Zuri took up the book again. “He asks for\nanother extension on his loan.”\nSavine would have raised her brows had Lisbit not been in the midst of\nshaping them. “Poor old Hisselring. It would be a shame to see him lose his\nhouse.”\n“The scriptures hold much praise for charity. But they also say only the\nthrifty will enter heaven.”\n“A cynic might observe that the scriptures can be used to support both\nsides of every argument.”\nZuri had the tiniest smile at the corner of her mouth. “A cynic might say\nthat is the point of them.”\nWhen Savine felt herself softening, even for a moment, she found it\neffective to taunt herself with the things other people had that she did not."

It\nmade the girl look like a peasant, but it was fashionable. One can always\nfind some small, irrelevant thing to be jealous of. The moment you lose\nyour murderous edge, after all, could be the moment you lose altogether.\nSome might have said that made her self-serving, shallow and\npoisonous. She would have replied that the self-serving, shallow, poisonous\npeople always seemed to come out on top. Then she would have laughed\never so sweetly, and whispered to Zuri to place a note in the book for their\nfuture destruction.\nSavine considered her face in the mirror. “A touch more blush. And I\nthink I have given Hisselring quite long enough. Call in the debt.”\n“My lady. Then there is Colonel Vallimir, and the mill in Valbeck.”\nSavine gave the loudest groan of frustration she could while pushing her\nlips out for Lisbit’s brush. “Still making a loss?”\n“Quite the reverse. He reports a large profit this month.”\nSavine could not help glancing sharply around, causing Lisbit to cluck\nwith annoyance as she smudged, then lean in so close to correct it with a\nfingertip that Savine could smell her oversweet breath.\n“Blessed are the thrifty… does Vallimir explain his sudden success?”\n“He does not,” said Zuri, slipping a necklace around Savine’s neck so\ngently she barely felt it. The new emeralds from her man in Ospria. Just the\none Savine would have picked.\n“Suspicious.”\n“It is.”\n“We should pay him a visit. Make sure our partners realise that our eyes\nare always on the details.

Zuri, clear a few days\nsomewhere in the next month so you and I can—”\n“I am afraid… I will not be able to accompany you.” Zuri said it as she\ndid everything. Gently. Gracefully. But very firmly.\nSavine stared at her in the mirror, momentarily lost for words. Lisbit\nswallowed. Metello glanced up from the wig on its stand, comb frozen in\nher hand.\n“Things in the South are… worse than ever,” said Zuri, eyes to the floor.\n“Some say the Prophet was killed by a demon. Some say he overcame her\nand is recovering from the battle. The emperor has been cast down, and his\nfive sons struggle with each other.

She was beautiful, tasteful, discreet, spoke five languages,\nhad a refined sense of humour and an effortless mastery of the workings of\nbusiness, and yet somehow never stole the attention for herself. She would\nno doubt have held as high a place in Gurkish society as Savine did in the\nUnion’s, had Gurkish society not crumbled into madness, causing refugees\nto flood across the Circle Sea and dark-skinned ladies’ companions to\nbecome so terribly fashionable in Adua.\nSince Savine’s father first introduced her, a friendless exile in desperate\nneed of a position, Zuri had made herself indispensable in a dozen ways.\nBut it was more than that. Savine’s acquaintance was immense. A great web\nof favours, partnerships and obligations that stretched across the Union and\nbeyond. But the truth was she had no friends at all. Apart from the one she\npaid.\n“You’ll be back soon?” she found she had asked.\n“As soon as I can.”\n“Should I send some men with you—”\n“I will be safer alone.”\nSavine caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror and realised, even with\nthe elaborate powdering, she looked quite crushed. That would not do at all.\n“But of course you must go,” she said, a little too brightly. “Family\ncomes first. I’ll pay for your passage.”\n“Lady Savine, I—”\n“You could check on our agents in Dagoska on the way. Make sure they\nare not fleecing us. And perhaps, under the circumstances, there might be\nsome bargains to be had on the shores of the Gurkish Sea.”\n“I would not be surprised,” said Zuri, frowning over at Freid.\nShe was clutching Savine’s dress like a shield, wide eyes showing over\nits embroidered collar. “Aren’t you worried about…Eaters?”\nZuri sighed. “God knows I have enough real worries without inventing\nmore.”\n“My aunt says the South is teeming with them,” said Lisbit, always keen\nto jump into any gossip with both feet.\n“My father saw one,” said Freid, breathless. “Years ago, at the Battle of\nAdua. They can steal your face, or turn you inside out just by looking at\nyou, or—”\n“Tall tales spread by people who should know better,” said Savine,\nsternly. “Lisbit, you will be my companion while Zuri is away. You’d enjoy\na trip to Valbeck, wouldn’t you?”\nLisbit’s rosy cheeks went even rosier. “I’d be honoured, my lady!”\nAs though her honour was Savine’s concern. Without making a sound,\nZuri screamed that she was a peerless lady’s companion, and therefore that\nthe lady she accompanied must also be peerless. Lisbit sent no such\nmessage. She was pretty enough, but she would be worse than worthless\nwith the book and she had no taste at all. Still. We must work with the tools\nwe have, as Savine’s father was forever saying. She smothered her\ndisappointment with a smile.\n“And, of course, if any of your family need work, or a place to stay, they\nwill always be welcome with me.”\n“You are too generous,” said Zuri. “As always.”"

If your brothers are half\nas useful as you, it will be the best investment I ever make.”\nThere was a knock at the door and Lisbit opened it a crack, a moment\nlater leaned close while Freid and Zuri were easing Savine’s dress on. “That\ngirl’s here, my lady.” Her lip wrinkled with distaste. “With a message from\nSpillion Sworbreck.”\nSavine felt that familiar flutter in her stomach, that familiar heat in her\nface. “When am I due at the Rucksteds’?”\nZuri consulted the watch. “Two hours and ten minutes.”\nSavine thought about that, but not for long. “Please send Tilde my\ndeepest regrets, but I cannot attend. I have a headache. Show Sworbreck’s\ngirl in.”\nShe was, of course, not Sworbreck’s girl at all, but Prince Orso’s. Most\nprinces would have employed some lord’s son as a valet, but he, with\ncharacteristic disregard for the rules, had a thirteen-year-old waif whose last\njob had been laundering soiled sheets in a brothel. Orso did love to\nsurround himself with curiosities. Probably to distract as much attention\nfrom his being the heir to the throne as possible.\nThe girl stood there now, freckle-faced and threadbare with a battered\nsoldier’s cap pulled all the way down to her eyes, as incongruous in\nSavine’s perfumed dressing room as a rat on a wedding cake. She watched\nMetello clamber up onto the stool to seat Savine’s wig with horrified\namazement, as though she had happened upon a coven of witches about\nsome arcane ritual.\n“Hildi, isn’t it?” said Savine, watching her in the mirror.\nShe nodded. Quick eyes, she had. “My lady.”\n“Master Sworbreck has asked for me?”\nThe girl gave an impressively guarded wink. “At his office, my lady.”\n“Take your cap off in front of Lady Savine,” said Lisbit, already putting\non airs now she felt she had a promotion. Savine wondered if she would\nhave throttled her by the time Zuri returned, and gave it about evens.\nHildi sourly pulled her cap off. She had a surprising mass of pinned-up,\npale-blonde hair underneath. Metello gave a hum of interest, hopped from\nher stool to poke at it with a comb, rubbed a lock between finger and thumb,\nfinally made Hildi squawk as she jerked a strand from her head and held it\nup to the light. She gave Savine a significant look from under her grey\nbrows.\n“Such beautiful hair you have,” said Savine.\n“Thanks,” grumbled Hildi, still rubbing her head. “I guess.”\n“I’ll give you three marks for it.”\n“For my hair?” Her surprise did not last long. “Ten.”\n“Five. You won’t miss it under that cap.”\n“The cap won’t fit without it. Ten or nothing.”"

Give her twelve, Zuri.”\nZuri slipped out that curved knife of hers. “Hold still, child.”\nSavine watched as Zuri neatly cropped her hair to stubble. “Like\nsunshine in a bottle,” murmured Savine as Metello laid out the lengths. “We\ncan stop into my wig-maker’s on the way. You run on ahead, girl.” The\nthought of seeing Orso had quite chased away her upset over Zuri’s\nforthcoming absence, and she caught Hildi’s eye in the mirror and gave her\nthe very same wink. “Tell Master Sworbreck I’ll be delighted to see him.”\n“Shit,” she gasped, knocking over a heap of Sworbreck’s papers as she\nsagged back, spent, an avalanche of notes spilling onto the floor behind her.\nShe unclenched her aching hand, the edge of the desk imprinted white\nacross her palm.\n“You…” She untangled the fingers of her other hand from Orso’s hair\nand patted him on the cheek. “Have been practising.”\n“As often as possible.” Orso grinned as he wiped his face and shrugged\nher leg off his shoulder.\n“I really should tell Sworbreck…” her breathing still ragged as she\nfished a niggling letter opener from under her shoulder and tossed it away,\n“to get a bed in here.”\n“Oh, I’d miss this desk.” Orso leaned towards her, but not quite far\nenough, making her crane up to kiss him. “So many memories.”\nShe pushed down her skirts and reached for his belt. “Your turn.”\n“Can we… talk first?”\n“Talk first?” She narrowed her eyes. She was still pleasantly soft,\nflushed and shuddery all over, but if he thought to slip something by her, he\nwould have a rude awakening. “What are you after?”\n“It’s this business in the North.” He knelt in front of her, looking\nearnestly up. “We can’t leave Finree dan Brock to fight our battles for us.\nWe’re supposed to be a bloody Union.”\n“Supposed to be—”\n“There has to be a response!” He thumped the desk, hard enough to\nmake the glasses rattle. “And… I feel I should be the man to lead it.”\nShe burst out laughing, saw he did not, and petered out into uncertain\nsilence. “You’re serious?”\n“Deadly. I went to see my father. Then I went to see yours—”\nShe jerked up. “You did what?”\n“Give me some credit, Savine, I didn’t lead with, ‘Your Eminence, I had\nmy tongue up your daughter last night.’ He doesn’t suspect a thing.”\n“You’d be a brave man to bet on what my father suspects.”\n“And I’m not one, is that it?”\nHe looked a little wounded, and she felt a little sad for him. “Oh, you\npoor baby.” She put her arms around his neck, drew him close and kissed\nhim softly. “After twelve years of drinking, gambling and fucking anything\nwith a hole in it, does no one take you seriously?”"

Rich people. People who might consider me… an\ninvestment.”\nSavine frowned. If she judged an opportunity to be poor, she would not\ndamage her reputation by passing it on. If she judged an opportunity to be\ngood, she wanted it for herself. But five thousand soldiers meant a vast\nexpense. Uniforms, weapons, armour, bedding, provisions. Then there was\nthe army of men and women needed to get those men to the field and keep\nthem there. The host of carts, wagons and beasts of burden. The food and\nsupplies for them.\nAnd, however much she wanted to be generous, Orso was beyond\nunreliable. He kept a brothel’s laundry girl instead of a servant, for pity’s\nsake. He scarcely understood the rules of business, let alone could be\nexpected to observe them. If she was to lend him money, she would need\nguarantees. A crystal-clear understanding of what she expected in return. A\ncontract. One so tightly binding, not even a king could wriggle free of it.\nPerhaps encouraged by her thoughtful silence, he gave the slightest,\nuncertain smile. “What do you think?”\nHer mouth smiled in return. Then, entirely independently of her mind, it\nsaid, “I’ll give you the money.”\nThere was a silence. As the expression gradually formed on his face, he\nlooked more suspicious than grateful. And who could blame him? What the\nhell was she doing? “Just… like that? All of it?”\n“Why have money at all if you can’t help… a friend.” Somehow she\nalmost choked on the word.\n“No repayment plan? No favours in kind? No speak-to-this-fellow about\nthat-piece-of-business?”\n“It’s all in a good cause, isn’t it? Patriotic.” Good causes? Patriotism? It\nwas as if some other person was speaking with her voice.\nHe reached up and gently stroked her cheek. He could be so delicate\nwhen he wanted. “Just when I think my opinion of you can’t get any\nhigher… you surprise me. I have to go! There’s so much to organise.”\nIt wasn’t until he whisked his hand away that she realised she’d been\npressing her face against it. She still felt the heat in her cheek. She was\nblushing like a child and turned away, embarrassed. Furious with herself, in\nfact.\n“Of course.” She smoothed her dress, fiddled with her necklace, adjusted\nher wig. “I’ve a dinner to attend myself. With Marshal Rucksted and his\nwife—”"

Except now, for some reason.\n“I’ll be in touch,” he whispered in her ear, making her neck tingle. “Or\nSworbreck will, at least.” And the door clattered shut behind him.\nSavine stood there, in silence, in Sworbreck’s cramped office, trying to\nunderstand what she had done. She loved to gamble, but she always knew\nthe game. This was reckless. This broke all her rules.\nAll those awfully intimate friends who she knew really envied and hated\nher would have a ready answer, of course.

Then she really can be above us all instead of merely acting\nlike it.\nPerhaps they would have been right. Perhaps she was harbouring some\nchildish dream of becoming High Queen of the Union. Zuri had a point,\nafter all: everyone looks better on their knees. Had Orso not been crown\nprince, she would have had no interest in him. What was there to be\ninterested in?\nApart from his looks, of course. And his easy confidence. And the way\nhe made her laugh. Really laugh, without a shred of pretence. That little\ntwitch at the corner of his mouth as he thought of a joke that set hers\ntwitching in sympathy as she wondered what it would be, never quite able\nto guess. No one could surprise her like he could. No one understood what\nshe needed like he did. She thought of how dull everything was while she\nwaited for the message from Sworbreck. The dressing, the dinners, the teas,\nthe profits, the dressing, the gossip, the strategising, the marks in the book.\nThen how everything exploded with colour when the message arrived. As if\nshe was in prison when she was not with him. As if she was buried and only\ncame to life when—\n“Shit,” she breathed.\nShe felt suddenly as weak at the knees as she had when Bremer dan\nGorst rammed her into the wall.

        "text": "Maker’s forge.”\nThe sweep was a quivery old drunk with a squinty eye and a stink\nhalfway between a tap-house and a mass grave. Two smells Broad knew\nbetter than he’d like. “I know my business,” he grunted, not even looking\nup as he led his boys past. Four of them, soot-smudged and hungry-looking,\nloaded with brushes and rods. The littlest whistled as he went, gave Broad a\ngrin with a couple of teeth missing. Broad tried to grin back, but he didn’t\nhave much of a grin in him.\n“I swear that fucker’s more drunk every time I see him,” muttered\nSarlby, frowning after the sorry little procession.\n“If I hadn’t sworn off drink already, the sight of him’d be a winning\nargument for temperance,” said Broad.\n“It’s a damn shame, lads that age sent down chimneys. How old was that\nyoungest one, you reckon?”\nBroad kept sweeping. He’d learned in Styria there’s a lot of things that\nare better just not thought about. Couldn’t be a coincidence that the happiest\nmen Broad ever knew were generally the stupidest.\n“They buy ’em, you know, from the pauper houses. Lads with no kin\nand no hopes. They’re hardly better’n slaves.” Sarlby wiped his forehead\nand leaned down close. “They scrub their knees with brine. Elbows, too.\nScrub ’em raw, morning and night, toughen ’em up like boot leather so they\ncan stand those hot chimneys.”\n“It’s a damn shame.” Broad lifted his lenses to rub at the sweaty bridge\nof his nose, then settled them back. Summer outside and the kettles cooking\nall day inside and the brewhouse was hot as an oven. “But the world’s full\no’ sad stories.”\n“No doubt.” Sarlby gave a joyless little chuckle. “I know one poor\narsehole lives in a cellar by the river over on Meadow Street, leaks so bad\nhe has to bail it out every morning like his home was a sinking skiff.\nWhere’s your family now?”\n“Malmer found us a set of rooms halfway up the hill.”\n“Oh, my lord.” Sarlby stuck his nose in the air and put on his idea of a\nnobleman’s voice. “A whole set?”\n“If you can call two a set. They cost, but my daughter’s got work as a\nmaid and my wife’s bringing some money in stitching. Funeral clothes,\nmostly.”\n“All the best clothes around here are funeral clothes.”\n“Aye.” Broad gave a sigh. “Always been good with a needle, Liddy.\nGood at whatever she turns her hand to. She’s the one with the talent.”\nSarlby grinned. “Not to mention the looks, the brains, the sense o’\nhumour… What is it you bring to the marriage, again?”\n“Honestly, I’ve no bloody idea.”\n“Well, good for you, and good for your family. Things aren’t so bad\nhalfway up the hill, where the vapours are a little thinner. Someone’s got to\ncome out on top, I guess. Someone’s got to do well while others suffer.”\nBroad gave Sarlby a look over his lenses. “Will you ever stop pricking at\nme?”\n“It’s your conscience doing that.”"

More of us every day. There’s going to be a Great\nChange. Just a matter o’ when.”\nMaybe it was the breath on his neck, or the sense of a secret shared, or\nthe risk of what they were discussing, or just the sticky heat, but something\ngave Broad a shiver. He’d wanted to change things once. Before he went to\nStyria and learned things don’t change easy. “’Course,” he grunted. “And\nthey’ll give every man his own dragon to ride and a candy castle to live in.\nThen when we get hungry, we can just eat the walls.”\n“I’m no fool, Bull. I know what the world is. But maybe we can spread\nthe wealth about a little. Maybe we can take some rich bastards out of those\npalaces on the hill and some poor families out of those cellars on Meadow\nStreet. Maybe we can give each man an honest wage for an honest day’s\nwork. Stop the false clocks and the fines and the girls pressed into night\nwork. Put an end to the butchers selling tainted meat, and the flour bulked\nout with chalk, and the ale watered down with rotten water. Maybe we can\nmake sure there’s no little boys being scrubbed with brine any more, at\nleast. That’d be worth something, wouldn’t it?”\n“Aye. That’d be worth something.” Broad had to admit there wasn’t\nmuch in Sarlby’s little speech he could argue with. “Never had you marked\ndown for an orator.”\nThere was a clatter somewhere, further down the brewhouse floor. “I\nstole the words from better men,” said Sarlby. “You like that, you should\ncome to a meeting, listen to the Weaver. He’d soon have you thinking our\nway.”\nBroad could hear someone shouting, muffled. “Can’t afford to think\nyour way,” he said, with some regret. “I gave up putting the world right a\nwhile back. First time we climbed those ladders, maybe. Second time, for\nsure. I’ve enough trouble at my back. Got to keep my head down. Look\nafter my family.”\nAnother clatter, louder, and a cloud of soot came belching from one of\nthe fireplaces they’d just doused.\n“What the hell?” Sarlby took a step towards it. “We’re trying to sweep\nup down here!”\nA scraping, slithering sound echoed from that fireplace, and another puff\nof soot, and a high wail came from inside. Broad went cold all over at the\nsound of it—shrill with pain and panic.\n“I can’t get out!” Had to be one of the sweep’s boys. “I can’t get out!”\nBroad and Sarlby stared at each other, Broad seeing his own helpless\nhorror mirrored in his old comrade’s face.\n“He’s trapped in there!” squawked Sarlby."

The fires had been burning all day. Even on the\noutside, the bricks were hot to touch.\nThere was another clatter, the sound of something sliding, and the boy’s\ncries turned to mindless, wordless shrieks.\nThe flue had been built no better than most of Valbeck, and Broad tore at\nits crumbling mortar with his fingertips, with his fingernails, as if he could\nrip it apart with his bare hands and get to that boy, but he couldn’t.\n“Here!” Malmer had run over, was shoving a crowbar at him, and Broad\nsnatched it from his hands and started digging at the loose mortar, stabbing,\nhacking, brick chips flying while he hissed curses.\nHe could hear the boy inside, no screams for help any more, just coughs\nand whimpers.\nA brick came grinding free and the wash of heat made Broad jerk his\nface away. He wedged the bar in the gap, used it as a lever, popped more\nbricks out.\nSoot came billowing with them and he coughed, dust across one side of\nhis lenses. He saw Sarlby grab at the side of the ragged hole, gasp at the\nheat, tear his apron off and wrap it around his hands.\nBroad rammed his bar into the chimney and heaved with all his weight,\ntrembling with effort, growling through gritted teeth. A great wedge of\nbricks tore free and tumbled down, the black flue opened up and Broad saw\nsomething wedged in there. Two black sticks. One had a boot on the end.\nSo hot inside. Oven hot. Broad could feel the sweat springing out of his\nface. The boy’s trousers were smouldering, smoking, the flesh of his legs all\nslick and bubbled. At first, Broad thought it was ash that slid off when he\ngrabbed them. Then he saw it was skin.\n“Damn it!” snarled Sarlby, digging again with the crowbar. Bricks and\nmortar tumbled down and the boy slithered out into Broad’s arms in a\nshower of soot.\nHe was hot, too hot to touch. It was a painful effort not to let him drop.\n“Set him down!” rasped Malmer, sweeping a bench clear and slapping\nembers from the boy’s smouldering hair.\n“Fuck,” whispered Sarlby, back of his arm across his mouth.\nThe boy didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Burned as he was, maybe that was\na good thing. There was a smell like cooking. A smell like bacon in the pan\nof a morning.\n“What do we do?” shouted Broad. “What can we do?”\n“Naught we can do.” Malmer’s grey-fuzzed jaw worked as he stared\ndown. “He’s dead.”\n“Cooked,” whispered Sarlby. “He fucking cooked alive.”\n“I thought you said the west side…” Broad turned to see the sweep\nstanding there, the little lad next to him, staring. “I thought you said—”"

A deep voice, soft and soothing.\n“Easy, big man. Let him go.”\nBroad was like a flatbow cranked too tight, all that strain running\nthrough him, far easier to let the bolt fly than not. Took a mighty effort not\nto break the sweep’s back over the chimney, to unclench his hands and let\ngo of his dirty coat, to step away from him, let him slide down to sit\nblubbing on the floor beside the boiler.\nMalmer patted Broad on the chest. “There you go. Nothing to gain with\nviolence. Not now.”\nNot ever. Broad knew that. He’d known that for years. But what he\nknew and what he did had never had much to do with each other.\nHe looked back at the boy, lying there all blackened, all reddened. He\nmade his aching fists unclench.

Faces all shiny and smeary and happy in the\ncandlelight.\n“You’re proper shitted,” said Isern. “But people are forgiving of you\nbecause you’re young, foolish and strangely lovable.”\n“I am lovable.” Rikke took another drink, which met just a smidge of\nburp-sick coming up the other way and made her half-choke and splutter ale\neverywhere. Would’ve felt extremely undignified if she’d been less drunk.\nAs it was, she just laughed. “And being drunk, well, that’s the point of a\nfeasht.”\nIsern’s eyes slipped slowly towards her over the rim of her cup. “The\nword is feast.”\n“That’s what I said,” said Rikke. “Feasht.” Bloody word, she couldn’t\nquite get her numb teeth all the way around it. The hall—or the barn, in\nfact, because they had to use what they could get these days—was falling\nquiet. Rikke’s father was getting up to give a speech.\n“Shush!” hissed Rikke. “Shush!”\n“I didn’t speak,” said Isern.\n“I said shush!” Her cracked voice rang out across the now-silent barn,"

Lot of good folk\ngone back to the mud these past few weeks. Lot of empty spaces, here, now,\nwhere friends should be sitting. Spaces that can’t ever be filled.” And he\nraised his cup, and so did everyone else, and a solemn murmur went around\nthe barn.\n“To the dead,” growled Shivers.\n“To the dead,” echoed Rikke, sniffing back a sudden wave of sadness\nand anger mixed.\n“But I’ve been blessed with loyal allies!” Rikke’s father nodded towards\nLady Finree, doing her best to look comfortable, bless her. “And now my\ndaughter’s come back to me.” He grinned down at Rikke. “So, in spite of\nsome sorrows, I count myself lucky!” And he hugged her tight, and kissed\nher head, and while the barn rang to its ancient rafters with cheers and\nwhoops, muttered softly, “Luckier’n I deserve, I reckon.”\n“I’d like to raise a cup myself!” Rikke clambered onto the table with a\nhand on her father’s shoulder and held her cup over her head. Ale slopped\nout and spattered on the wood, though it was already so ale-spattered no\none could’ve noticed the difference. “To all o’ you sorry bastards who were\nso hopelessly lost, but thanks to the tender guidance of Isern-i-Phail, were\nable to find your way back to me!”\n“To lost bastards!” someone roared, and everyone drank, and there was\nlaughter, and a fragment of song, and a fight broke out in a corner and\nsomeone got punched and lost a bit of a tooth, but all in good humour.\n“By the dead, I’m glad you’re back safe, Rikke.” Her father cupped her\nface in his gnarled old hands. “Anything happened to you…” Seemed like\nhe had tears glimmering at the corners of his eyes, and he smiled, and\nsniffed. “You’re all the good I’ve done.”"

The way he talked worried\nher—sappy and sentimental, always looking back like he’d nothing ahead\nto look to. But the last thing she wanted was to let him see she was worried,\nso she clowned more than ever.\n“What’re you talking about, you silly old bastard? You’ve done piles of\ngood. Mountains. Who’s done more good for the North than you? Not a one\no’ these fools wouldn’t die for you.”\n“Maybe. But they shouldn’t have to. I’m just not sure…” He frowned\nout at the barnful of drunk warriors like he hardly saw them. Like he was\nstaring through them with the Long Eye and saw something horrible\nbeyond. “Not sure I got the bones for the fight any more.”\n“Now listen.” She caught his deep-lined face and dragged it back\ntowards her, growling the words at him, fierce. “You’re the Dogman!\nThere’s no man in the North got more bones than you. How many battles\nyou fought in?”\nHe gave a faint smile at that. “Feels like pretty much all of ’em.”\n“It is pretty much all of ’em! You fought beside the Bloody-Nine! You\nfought beside Rudd Threetrees! You beat Bethod in the High Places!”\nHe licked at one pointed tooth as he grinned. “I don’t like to boast, you\nknow.”\n“Man with your name doesn’t need to.” She raised her chin, puffed\nherself up, showed him how proud she was to be his kin. “You’ll beat Stour\nNightfall and his arse-lickers, and we’ll see him hanged with brambles, and\nI’ll cut the bloody cross in him and send his fucking guts back to his\ndaddy!” She realised she was snarling the words, spraying spit, shaking her\nfist in his face, and she made the fingers uncurl and wiped her mouth with\nthem instead. “Or something…”\nHer father was somewhat taken aback at her bloodthirstiness. “You\nnever talked like that before.”\n“Aye, well, I never had my home burned, either. Never understood why\nfeuds were such a popular pastime in the North but I reckon I’m getting it\nnow.”\nHer father winced. “Hoped my scores would die with me and you could\nwalk free of ’em.”\n“Weren’t your fault! Or mine. Scale Ironhand attacked us! Black Calder\nburned Uffrith! Stour fucking Nightfall chased me through the woods. They\ntrampled your garden…” she finished, lamely.\n“The beauty o’ gardens is that they grow back.”\n“Changes your feelings,” she growled, the anger bubbling up again at\nthe memory, “when you’re sunk to your neck in a freezing river, starving\nand shitting yourself and quite fucking chafed as well, actually, and hearing\nsome bastard brag on the horrors he’ll inflict on you.

Swore to myself I’d see Stour killed, and I swear I\nwill.”\nRikke’s father gave a sigh. “The beauty o’ making yourself a promise is\nthat no one else complains if you break it.”\n“Huh.” Rikke realised she had her fists clenched again, decided to keep\n’em that way. “Isern says I’m soft. Says I’m coddled.”\n“There’s worse you could be.”\n“Isern says ruthlessness is a quality much loved o’ the moon.”\n“Might be you should be careful what lessons you learn from Isern-i-\nPhail.”\n“She wants what’s best for me. What’s best for the North.”\nHer father gave a sad smile at that. “Believe it or not, we all want what’s\nbest. The root o’ the world’s ills is that no one can agree on what it is.”\n“She says you have to make of your heart a stone.”\n“Rikke.” And he laid his hands on her shoulders. “Listen to me, now.\nI’ve known a lot of men did that down the years. Men who had plenty in\n’em to admire. Men who turned their hearts hard so they could lead, so they\ncould win, so they could rule. Did ’em no good in the end, nor anyone\naround ’em.” He gave her shoulders a squeeze. “I like your heart how it is.\nMight be if there were a few more like it, the North’d be a better place.”\n“You reckon?” she muttered, far from convinced.\n“You’ve got bones, Rikke, and you’ve got brains. You like to hide it.\nEven from yourself, maybe.” He looked out at the room, and the shouting\nmen that filled it. “I reckon they’ll need your bones and your brains, when\nall this is over. But they’ll need your heart, too. When I’m gone.”\nRikke swallowed. Turned her fear into a joke, as usual. “Where you\ngoing, the shit-pit?”\n“Shit-pit first. Then my blanket. Don’t get too drunk, eh?” He leaned\nclose to murmur in her ear. “Be a shame to make o’ your heart a wineskin,\neither.”\nShe frowned as she watched him go. He’d always been thin, but wiry-\nstrong like a bent bow. Now he looked crooked, brittle. She caught herself\nwondering how long he had left. Wondering what would become of her\nwhen he was gone. What would become of them all. If they were counting\non her bones and her brains, they were in bigger trouble than she’d thought.\nShivers sat frowning into the room, bit of a space around him. He had a\nreputation made most folk keep their distance, even drunk. There were too\nmany bad men in the North and Caul Shivers, by most accounts, was one of\nthe very worst. Bad men are a terrible curse, no doubt, right up until you’re\nin bad trouble and there’s one on your side. Then they’re the best thing ever.\n“Hey, hey, Shivers!” She slapped him on the shoulder and nearly missed."

Then they’re the best thing ever.\n“Hey, hey, Shivers!” She slapped him on the shoulder and nearly missed.\nLucky thing it was a big shoulder. “Not sure you’re really getting this whole\nfeast thing. We are rejoicing in my heroic return. You’re meant to smile.”\nShe looked at his ruined face, the lid sagging around his metal eye and the\ngreat burn across his cheek. “You can smile, can’t you?”\nHe looked at her hand on his shoulder, then up at her, and didn’t smile at\nall. “Why were you never scared of me?”\n“You just never seemed all that scary. Always found your eye sort of\npretty. Shiny.” Rikke patted his scarred cheek. “You always just seemed…\nlost. Like you lost yourself and didn’t know where to look.” She put her\nhand on his chest. “But you’re in there, still. You’re in there.”\nHe looked as shocked as if she’d slapped him, and there was a gleam of\ndamp in his real eye, or maybe it was just her own sight that was smeary, as\nCaul Shivers wasn’t really known as a big weeper, except when his bad eye\ndribbled, which was a different thing.\n“Lot o’ teary old men about today,” she muttered, pushing herself away\nfrom the table. “I need another drink.” Probably another drink wasn’t a\ngood idea, but for some reason she’d always found bad ideas the more\nappealling kind. She was sloshing ale into her cup, tongue pressed into the\ndent in her lip where the chagga usually sat with the effort of not spilling,\nwhen she caught sight of Leo dan Brock.\nHe usually had a few of his friends with him, and the one with all the\nteeth wasn’t far away, grinning at a serving woman like his smile was a gift\nshe was lucky to get, but it looked like the rest had been scared off by his\nmother. To be fair, Lady Finree was a pretty fearsome woman, and she was\ndelivering a pretty fearsome lecture to her son, if her wagging finger and his\nscrewed-up face were a guide.\n“… but I shan’t cramp you any longer,” Rikke heard her say as she came\ncloser. “Someone has to manage this retreat, after all.”\nLeo glared daggers at his mother as she strode away, then tossed his\nhead back and drained his cup, then threw the cup across the rubbish-strewn\ntable and started drinking straight from the jug, little rivulets running down\nhis hard-working throat.\n“I sometimes think more ale gets spilled than drunk at these things,” said\nRikke in the Union tongue, both hands on the table beside him with her\nshoulders up around her ears.\nHe lowered the jug and peered at her over the rim, answered in\nNorthern. “If it isn’t the Dogman’s missing daughter. Glad to be back?”\n“I’d prefer to be back in Uffrith, but Uffrith’s burned, and the people\nscattered. The lucky ones, anyway. Always thought I hated the place, but\nnow it’s gone I miss it…” She had to swallow another lump of sadness.\n“Still, this is an awful lot better’n being hunted through a freezing forest by"

Lot o’ bastards in the North, but\nthat Stour Nightfall.” And she bared her teeth at a sudden stab of hate. “By\nthe dead, he’s a bastard for the songs.”\n“You Northmen love to make songs about bastards.”\n“I’m a Northwoman,” she said, poking at her chest with a thumb.\n“I noticed,” he said, raising his brows at it. Her thumb, not her chest.\nThough maybe he was taking a sly look at that, too. She somewhat hoped\nso but was too drunk to tell. Seemed every word between them had an edge\nto it. A little danger, like the jabs in a duel. A little thrill, like each breath\nwas a gamble.\n“Not easy,” she grunted, dropping on the empty stool where his mother\nhad been sitting, thumping her boot down on the table and rocking\ncarelessly back. “Being in the shadow of a famous parent.”\n“No. I miss my father.” Leo frowned into his ale-jug. “Three years, he’s\nbeen gone. Still feels like yesterday. Didn’t get nearly so much of my\nmother’s attention when he was alive.”\n“You should be glad of your mother’s attention. Never knew mine.”\n“I’ll be lord governor soon,” said Leo, trying and largely failing to sound\nlord governor-ish, though it was a failure Rikke found endearing. She was\nfinding everything about him endearing right then. Specially his\ncollarbones, for some reason. Strong, bold collarbones, he had, with a hard\ndimple between she reckoned her nose would nuzzle into just right. “The\nking’ll send an edict, and I’ll be able to do whatever I want.”\nRikke opened her eyes very wide. “So… you only have to do what your\nmama tells you till a man with a golden hat gives you permission?” She\npuffed out her cheeks. “That’s impressive. That is really quite fucking\nsomething.”\nHe’d been frowning at first, but she was pleased to see it crumble into a\nsheepish smile. “You’re right. I’m being a prick.”\nShe was thinking that sometimes a prick is the very thing you need, but\nshe just about stopped herself saying it. A girl should maintain some\nmystery, even when drunk.\nLeo leaned close and she felt a guilty flush of heat on the side facing\nhim, like he was made of hot coal and she was sitting too close to the fire.\n“They say you were raised by witches.”\nRikke snorted as she glanced over at Isern-i-Phail. “Bitches, maybe.”\n“They say you’ve got the Long Eye.”\nShe took the chance to lean a bit closer, turning her left eye towards him.\n“That’s right.” Their faces couldn’t have been more than a few inches apart,\nand the space between felt hot as an open oven. “I can see your future.”\n“What’s there?” Doubt, and laughter, and curiosity in his voice, and did\nshe catch just a husky hint of desire as well? By the dead, she hoped so.\n“Trouble with seeing the future is you don’t want to spoil the surprise.”"

By the dead, she hoped so.\n“Trouble with seeing the future is you don’t want to spoil the surprise.”\nShe stood up, nearly tripping over her own stool, but steadying herself\nmasterfully by clutching at the edge of the table. “I’ll show you.”\nShe caught him by the arm, started trying to drag him up, but got\ndistracted halfway and ended up just thoughtfully feeling it. All hard in his\nsleeve. Like it was made of wood.\n“That’s a lot of arm,” she murmured, and pulled him towards the big\nbarn doors, open wide now men were filtering off to their tents and their\nbedrolls. Leo’s cautious friend, Jurand or whatever, was watching them\nfrom a place near the wall with this disapproving expression, but she\ncouldn’t be arsed to be disapproved of right then. Isern-i-Phail was stood\nnext to Shivers, her bare, bandaged leg propped up on a stool.\n“That is a leg.” Isern gestured at it proudly, sinews standing from her\nwhite thigh. “That, d’you see, is all a leg should be and more.”\nShivers gave the leg in question a careful examination. “No doubt.”\n“The other one,” said Isern, “is even better.”\nShivers’ eyes, or his eye, at any rate, shifted from Isern’s leg to her face.\n“You don’t say?”\n“I do.” She leaned down towards him. “And as for what’s betwixt the\ntwo…”\n“Excuse us,” said Rikke, slipping past and dragging Leo after, both\ntrying to stifle their giggles. The night air was like a slap after the warmth\ninside, and it pinched her nose and made her head spin. Fires pricked at the\nnight, hint of tents in the darkness, snatch of someone singing some old\nsong about some dead hero. She led Leo by the elbow, heading nowhere,\nboth of them laughing whenever they took a wobble.\nHe grabbed at her shoulder. “Where are you taking—” And he grunted\nas she shoved him back against a crumbling wall, pushed her fingers into\nhis hair and pulled him towards her. She held him there, their faces just a\nfew finger-breadths apart. She dragged the moment out, his hot, eager, ale-\nsmelling breath tickling at her cheek. She dragged the moment out, distant\nfirelight gleaming in the corners of his eyes. She dragged the moment out,\ngetting closer, getting closer, until he was pushing his smiling lips towards\nher and she brushed them with hers, one way, then the other.\nThen they were kissing, hungry, messy, lips sucking and teeth scraping\nand tongues lapping and Rikke reflected that she was quite an excellent\nkisser even if she did say so herself and he wasn’t at all bad either. No point\npecking away like a sparrow at the seed. You’ve got to get stuck in. They\nbroke apart to catch their breath and he swayed a bit and wiped his mouth,\nhis eyes darting all over her face in a slightly flustered, slightly excited,\nslightly drunk sort of way that made her feel flustered and excited and\ndrunk as well. Then he took a long breath and blew it out."

Then he took a long breath and blew it out.\n“So… where’s this surprise, then?”\nShe grinned. “You bastard.” A rickety door stood with a crack of\ndarkness showing and she shouldered it wobbling open and bundled him\nthrough. He tripped over his own feet and went tottering, a thud as he fell,\nthen silence.\n“Leo?” she hissed, shuffling forward. It was close to pitch-black, her\nhand out and feeling for him. Then she felt her wrist caught and she yelped\nas she was dragged down, fell into something soft, a heap of straw, smelling\nof earth and animals and rot, but Rikke had never been all that picky and\nshe was feeling even less picky than usual right then. Picky Rikke. She gave\na little snort of laughter as Leo slid on top of her, kissing her again, making\neager little grunts in his throat that made her grunt back, his mouth hot in\nthe darkness.\nOne of his hands slipped under her shirt, up her waist, up her ribs, and\nshe grabbed his wrist.\n“Wait!” she hissed.\nHe froze. “What?” Silence, and she could hear his quick breath over the\nsound of her own thudding heartbeat. “You all right?”\n“Shouldn’t we… get your mother’s permission first?”\nShe saw the faint gleam of his teeth as he smiled. “You bastard.”\n“Or maybe His Majesty’s? A royal edict probably overrules a lady\ngovernor—”\n“You’re right,” he said propping himself up. “I’ll send a message to\nAdua. They’ll want to discuss it in the Closed Council, but we should get a\nknight herald back with an answer before—”\n“Not sure I’ll be this drunk by then,” she said, already wriggling out of\nher trousers. Before she got them past her hips, her hand slipped and she\nflopped over and got a mouthful of straw, hissed and spat, giggled and\nburped, and they were kissing again, both her hands on his face, his jaw\nsharp and the stubbled skin rough under her fingertips.\nHis hand slipped down between her thighs and she tried to open her legs\nbut was all tangled with her belt, straw prickling her arse as she pushed\nherself against him, rubbing, rubbing, her tongue in his mouth and his\nbreath fast and sounding like he was smiling. She was smiling, too, smiling\nright to the corners of her face, and this surely beat being chased through\nthe woods when it came to entertainment.\nDidn’t need the Long Eye to see where things were going now. Nothing\nlike being wanted, is there? Wanted by someone you want. Always seems\nlike magic, that something can feel so good but cost nothing.\nShe rolled over on top of him, partly thinking she’d take charge, partly\nquite annoyed by the straw in her arse. Managed to work her trousers down\naround her ankles so she was straddling him, started wrestling with his belt\nbut couldn’t see a thing and the darkness was all spinning and she’d half a\nthought she might fall over even though she was only kneeling up and in\nhay too and her fingers were all clumsy and it was like trying to unpick"

Where’s the\nbuckle?”\n“Usual place,” he whispered, and his hot breath tickled her ear and gave\nher a funny shudder. “Where else would it be?” And there was a faint jingle\nas he eased it open and she pushed her hand down inside.\n“Oh,” she said, stupidly. They always surprised her, somehow, cocks.\nStrange bloody piece of anatomy. Still, she knew her way around one, even\nif she did say so herself. No point flicking away like you’re scared of it.\nYou’ve got to get stuck in.\n“Ah!” And he jerked up from the straw. “Gently.”\n“Sorry.” Maybe she was a little rusty after all and the shed surely felt\nlike it was spinning now, spinning like a boat going down a whirlpool, but a\ndecidedly pleasant whirlpool, warm and sticky and smelling of animals, and\nhis hand was busy between her spread legs, not quite in the right spot but\nclose enough, and she shifted her hips until it was in the right spot and\nstarted grunting in his ear, rocking back and forth, back and forth, back and\nforth.\n“Shit,” he whispered in the blackness, fumbling at her, voice on the edge\nof laughter. “Where’s your…”\n“Usual place,” she hissed back at him, spitting in her hand, catching\nhold of his cock and wriggling closer. “Where else would it be?”\nThe Lion and the Wolf\nI\nf anyone asked, he’d always say he loved the ladies. The chase. The\nconquest. The bawdy jokes. But the truth was, Leo had never been\ncomfortable around women. Men made sense. Slapped backs and firm\nshakes and blunt talk and wrestling. But women were a bloody mystery. He\nnever quite knew what to make of their chatter and their feelings and their\nstrange, soft bodies. Tits. Men talked a lot about tits. So Leo did, too.\nNudge in the ribs, look at the cargo she’s carrying. But if he was entirely\nhonest, he didn’t really understand the appeal. To Leo, tits were just…\nthere.

He fished\nup his shirt and his boots, took a step towards the chink of light down the\nedge of the door, and looked back.\nRikke lay in the hay, arms flung heedlessly wide, gold ring through her\nnose gleaming with the morning light, tangled mass of chains and runes and\ntalismans shifting as she breathed, a stray strand of hair across her face.

But perhaps his\nproblem had been finding the right one. Rikke was nothing like the ladies\nhis mother would manoeuvre into his path in Ostenhorm. They always\nseemed to say one thing but mean another, like talking was a game you won\nby making the other player totally confused. Rikke had known him for\nyears. There was no need for fumbling small talk. And every moment with\nher felt like an adventure. She could kidnap a conversation and in a breath\ncarry it off into strange territory. You never knew where you’d end up, but it\nwas always honest.\nHe tossed his boots away and slipped down beside her again. He lifted\nhis hand, paused a moment then, grinning all the while, gently pushed that\nstrand of hair off her face. Her eyes didn’t open, but her mouth curled into a\nsmile. “Decided not to slink away after all?”\n“Realised there’s nowhere I’d rather be.”\nIt gave him an odd little shiver when she opened those big grey eyes and\nlooked at him. “Fancy another go around, eh?” And she stretched out, arms\nover her head, wriggling back into the straw.\n“No word from the king yet,” he said, leaning close to kiss her.\nShe pulled her chin away from him. “And the lady governor?”\n“Nothing in writing,” he murmured, “so I’m taking it they approve.” Her\nbreath was sour, her lips scummy at the corners, and he didn’t care.\nShe slid a hand into his hair, gripped him hard and kissed him deep.\nHungry, tonguey kisses that left nothing to the imagination. She rolled him\nover, getting up onto one elbow, biting at her lip as she started undoing his\nbelt and he squirmed back into the hay, breath coming fast again, headache\nforgotten—\nShe stopped, frowning. Pushed herself up to sitting, wrinkling her nose.\n“Can you smell that?”\n“They keep animals in here.”\n“No. Smells sweet. Smells like…” Rikke sniffed, wafting air at her nose.\nHer little finger was twitching. “Oh no.” Her face fell as she stared at it.\n“Always the worst times.” All her fingers were twitching now. “Get Isern-i-\nPhail!” And she dropped back in the straw, her whole arm shaking.\n“What?”\n“Get Isern!” Rikke grabbed the dowel on its thong around her neck and\nbit down hard on it. Next moment, she arched back like a full-drawn bow.\nShe made a great, long, hollow wheeze as if all the breath was being\nsqueezed out of her. Then she dropped, hay flying as she writhed, muscles\nmadly jerking, kicking heels hacking at the dirt floor.\n“Shit!” squeaked Leo, one arm out towards her, the other out towards\nthe door, wanting to hold her down so she didn’t smash herself, wanting to\nhelp her and not knowing how.

They both spun wide-eyed as Leo\npounded up, then broke apart and he sprang between them over the flames,\nknocking a pot of water bouncing away.\n“Sorry!”\nHe nearly fell as his bare foot slid on the other side, tottered a few steps\nand was charging on, through the Northmen’s campsite, smoky fires and the\nsmell of cooking and someone singing in a rumbling bass as he pissed into\nthe trees.\n“Where’s Isern-i-Phail?” he screeched. “Isern-i-Phail!”\nHe followed a pointed hand towards a tent, hardly even knowing whose\nhand it was, lashed at the flap and ripped his way through.\nHe’d half-expected to find her bent over a cauldron, but the hillwoman\nwas sitting in her tent in a tattered Gurkish dressing gown, her bandaged leg\npropped on an old crate, a smoking chagga pipe in one hand and a jug of\nlast night’s ale in the other.\nShe glanced at him as he tried to catch his breath. “I rarely turn down a\nhalf-naked man first thing in the morning, but—”\n“She’s having a fit!” he wheezed out.\nIsern dropped the pipe in the jug with a hiss, hauled her injured leg off\nthe crate and stiffly stood. “Show me.”\nThere she lay, not thrashing like she had been but still squirming and\nmaking that wheezing moan, spit around the dowel turned to froth and\nflecked across her twisted face. She must’ve caught her head against the\nwall, there was blood in her hair.\n“By the dead,” grunted Isern, kneeling beside her and putting a hand on\nher shoulder. “Help me hold her, then!” And Leo knelt, too, one hand on\nRikke’s arm and one on her knee while Isern rooted through her hair to look\nat the cut. It was then he realised Rikke was stark naked and he wasn’t far\noff.\n“We were just…” Maybe Antaup could’ve pulled out an innocent\nexplanation. He’d had the practice. But Leo had never been much of a liar\nand this needed a true master of the art. “We were just…”\n“I am a woman of the world.” Isern-i-Phail didn’t even bother to look at\nhim. “I can hazard a mad guess at what you were about, boy.” She leaned\ndown over Rikke, wiping the froth away with her fingers, smoothing her\nhair back from her face. “Shhhh,” she breathed. Sang it, almost. “Shhhhh.”\nEver so gently she held her. Ever so softly she spoke. More gently and\nmore softly than Leo would’ve thought that hard-faced hillwoman could\nhave."

Come on back.”\nRikke gave a feeble grunt, a last flurry of twitches running through her\nlegs and up to her shoulders. She groaned, slowly pushed the spitty dowel\nout of her mouth with her tongue.\n“Fuck,” she croaked.\n“There’s my girl!” said Isern, the edge back on her voice. Leo closed his\neyes and gave a sigh of relief. She was all right. And he realised he was still\ngripping her tight even though she’d stopped jerking, and he let go quickly,\nsaw the marks of his fingers pink on her arm.\nIsern was already working Rikke’s trousers over her limp feet and up her\nlegs. “Help me get her dressed.”\n“Not sure I know—”\n“Got her undressed, didn’t you? Same thing, d’you see, but in reverse.”\nRikke gave a long groan as she slowly sat up, clutching at her bloody\nhead.\n“What did you see?” asked Isern, wrapping Rikke’s shirt around her\nshoulders and squatting beside her.\n“I saw a bald weaver with a purse that never emptied.” Rikke’s voice\nsounded strange. Rough, hollow. Not like her voice at all. It made Leo feel\na little afraid, somehow. And a little excited.\n“What else?” asked Isern.\n“I saw an old woman whose head was stitched together with golden\nwire.”\n“Huh. What else?”\n“I saw a lion… and a wolf… fight in a circle of blood. They fought tooth\nand claw and the wolf had the best of it…” She stared up at Leo. “The wolf\nhad the best of it… but the lion was the winner.” She caught him by the\nhand, staring into his face, dragging him close with a shocking strength.\n“The lion was the winner!”\nTill that moment, Leo had been sure it was all guff. The Long Eye. Old\ntales and superstitions. What else could it be? But looking into Rikke’s\nwild, wet eyes, pupils swollen up so big there was no iris left at all but only\nblack pits with no bottom, he felt the hairs on his neck rise and the skin on\nhis spine tingle. Suddenly he began to doubt.\nOr maybe he began to believe.\n“Am I the lion?” he whispered.\nBut she’d closed her eyes, sagged back in the straw, her limp hand\ndropping from his.\n“Out you go, now, boy,” said Isern, shoving his boots and his shirt into\nhis arms.\n“Am I the lion?” he called again, for some reason desperate to know.\n“Lion?” Isern laughed as she pushed him out into the yard. “Ass,\nmaybe.” And she kicked the door shut.\nNo Unnecessary Sentiment\n“M\ny father thinks very highly of you.”\nInquisitor Teufel’s permanently narrowed eyes swivelled from the sunny\ncountry slipping past the window to Savine, but she said nothing.

To have\ncalled her hard-looking would have been an epic understatement. She\nappeared to be chiselled from flint. Her chin and cheekbones jutted, her\nnose was blunt and slightly bent with two marked creases above the bridge\nfrom constant frowning, her dark hair was shot with grey and bound back\ntightly as a murderer’s shackles.\nSavine flashed her artfully constructed artless smile, the one people\nusually could not help returning. “And he’s not a man who gives praise\nlightly.”\nTeufel acknowledged that with the faintest nod, but kept her silence.\nCompliments can coax more from some people than torture, and Savine had\nfound compliments relayed from some respected third party most effective\nof all. But Teufel’s locks were not so easily picked. She swayed faintly with\nthe jolting of the carriage, face as guarded as a bank vault.\nSavine could not help shifting at a sudden pang. With impeccable\ntiming, her menses were starting early, the familiar dull ache through her\nbelly and down the backs of her thighs with an occasional sharp twinge into\nher arse by way of light relief. As usual, she struggled with every muscle to\nlook perfectly relaxed and forced her grimace into an ever-brighter smile.\n“He tells me you were raised in Angland,” she said, trying a different\ntack.\nFinally, Teufel spoke, but only the minimum. “I was, my lady.” She\nreminded Savine of one of Curnsbick’s engines: stripped back, angular and\nunapologetic. No unnecessary flesh, no unnecessary ornament, and for\ndamn sure no unnecessary sentiment.\n“You worked in a coal mine.”\n“I did.” And had not changed her clothes since, by the look of it. A worn\nshirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows and those leather braces workmen\nwear. Coarse trousers tucked into tightly laced work boots, one of which\nwas thrust defiantly out into the centre of the carriage floor, as if staking a\nclaim to the territory. Scarcely a gesture towards femininity anywhere. Had\nthere ever been a woman who took less care over her appearance? Savine\nsubtly shifted her new dress in a vain attempt to move a chafing seam away\nfrom her damp armpit. She would never have admitted it but, hell, how she\nenvied her, especially in this heat.\n“Coal is changing the world,” she observed, nudging the window down\nto get a little more air in and swishing her fan a touch faster.\n“I heard.”\n“Is it changing it for the better, though?” muttered the boy, wistfully.\n“That’s the question.”\nHe glanced up, and a flush spread across his pale cheeks, and his big,\nsad, frog-like eyes flickered over to Teufel. She gave him the same calm,\ncritical stare she gave Savine. A look that let him judge for himself whether\nhe should have opened his mouth. The lad looked at the floor and folded his\narms even tighter about himself.\nThey certainly made an odd couple. The woman of flint and the boy of\nwax.

She not showing a hint of feeling, he with every emotion written right\nacross his face. They seemed the very last people one would suspect of\nbeing agents of the Inquisition. But Savine supposed that was rather the\npoint.\n“Are you expecting trouble in Valbeck?” she asked.\n“If I was,” said Vick, “I imagine your father would’ve told you not to\ncome.”\n“He did. I ignored him. And I hardly think he would be sending you if\nthere was not at least a little trouble there. Am I right?”\nVick did not even blink. There really was no rattling the woman. “Are\nyou expecting trouble?” she asked, answering a question with another.\n“I find it’s always wise to expect it. I own a share in a textile mill in the\ncity.”\n“Among other things.”\n“Among other things. I have a partner there, one Colonel Vallimir.”\n“Once commander of the King’s Own First Regiment. Too inflexible to\nwork under Mitterick. Is he flexible enough to work under you?”\nApparently, Vick not only knew her own business, but everybody else’s.\n“Where would be the fun in bending flexible people to your whims?” asked\nSavine. “And partners are useful. Someone to oversee operations. Someone\nto share the risks.”\n“Someone to take the blame.”\n“You should go into business.”\n“Not sure I’m ruthless enough. I’ll stick with the Inquisition.”\nSavine rewarded that with her exhaustively practised spontaneous laugh.\n“The mill was losing money. Troubles with the workers, I expect. I always\nused to say that textiles are for wearing, not investing in.” She flicked an\ninfinitesimal speck of dust from the embroidered cuff of her travelling\njacket. “There are lots of ex-soldiers among the weavers, violent men prone\nto grudges. When the guilds were broken up, they were left rudderless,\ninjured in their pockets and their pride.”\n“What changed your mind?”\n“The usual. I realised how much money was to be made. And now, of a\nsudden, I find my mill is in profit.”\n“Which is a wonderful thing, of course,” said Lisbit, who never had\nanything worth saying but could never stop saying it anyway, and to make\nmatters worse was saying it in an ever more affected accent since she was\nmade temporary companion. At this rate, Savine would have throttled her\nbefore they reached Valbeck, let alone by the time Zuri returned from the\nSouth.\n“Which is a wonderful thing,” said Savine. “But profits so fast and so\nlarge make me… suspicious.”\n“You should go into the Inquisition.”\n“In this corset? I hardly think so.”\nNow Teufel smiled. Just a little curl at the corner of her mouth.\nConsidered, like every expression of hers. As though she had been over her\nbudget and decided she could afford one.\n“You don’t give much away, do you?” said Savine.\nThat smile curled up a little more. “Comes from not having much,\nmaybe.”\nIt was not mockery, exactly. They simply both knew that Teufel had seen\nthings, suffered things, overcome things that Savine would never have to."

She needed no wigs or powder to hide behind. She sat\nsafe in the certainty that she was carved from fire-toughened wood, and\ncould break Savine in half with those veined coal miner’s hands if she\npleased.\nSavine found she was shifting a little to hide her sword. She wished she\nhad not worn it. How absurd an affectation it seemed, sitting opposite\nsomeone who cut people for a living.\nVick sat with her leg stretched out. The old niggle in her hip was acting up,\nand every bump in the road sent a jolt through the carriage and a jab of pain\nfrom her knee right to her back, but she wasn’t about to squirm for a\ncomfortable position she knew she’d never find.\nSavine dan Glokta looked serenely comfortable, one leg carelessly\ncrossed over the other, the shiny toe of one immaculate boot showing\nbeneath the embroidered hem of a dress that probably cost more than the\ncarriage, and the carriage was an expensive one. Vick had never seen a\nwoman who took more trouble about her appearance, and she’d once spent\na horrible half-hour lurking at the back of one of Queen Terez’s functions.\nNot a hair of Savine’s eyebrows, not a thread of her clothes, not a speck\nof her powder was out of place, even in the heat. All so porcelain-perfect it\nwas a surprise whenever she moved, talked, breathed like ordinary humans.\nShe wore a ridiculous little sword with jewels on the hilt. She wore a tiny,\npointless hat fastened with a crystal pin. She fluttered a fan made from\nfillets of iridescent seashell gracefully back and forth, back and forth. She\nhad a nest of golden braids which only a dunce could’ve imagined was her\nreal hair. Or anyone’s real hair. Had there been any justice in the world, she\nwould’ve looked absurd. But Vick knew well there was no justice, and she\nlooked spectacular.\nMight Vick have looked like that herself, if her father hadn’t been taken\nby the Inquisition? If her family hadn’t been sent to Angland along with\nhim? Might she have been sitting there, in a wig that took a month to\nweave, tapping the toe of those wonderful, horrible boots, as smugly\nsatisfied with herself as a cat by the kitchen fire?\nVick learned long ago that might have is a game with no winners. Few\ngames do have winners, in the end.\n“Do you have those sweets, Lisbit?” asked Savine.\nLisbit, who was only slightly less well groomed than her mistress,\nslipped a polished box from her travelling bag. Perfume wafted out as she\nrevealed no more than a dozen little sugared fruits, nestling in crushed\npaper. Vick’s mouth flooded with spit. When you’ve starved, food comes to\ntouch a special place, and you can never quite go back.\n“Can I tempt you?” murmured Savine.\nVick glanced from her overpriced sweets to her overpriced smile. In the\ncamps, everything had a cost, and usually with painful interest, too."

In the\ncamps, everything had a cost, and usually with painful interest, too.\nLooking into Savine dan Glokta’s eyes, hard and shiny as the eyes of an\nexpensive doll, Vick doubted you could find a more merciless creditor if\nyou scoured the whole of Angland.\nOwing one Glokta was far too many. “Not for me.”\n“I entirely understand. Can’t eat them myself.” Savine sighed as she\narched her back, pushing one hand into her impossibly slender side. “I’m\nlike a weight of sausage meat squeezed into a half-weight skin already.”\nIt wasn’t mockery, exactly. They just both knew that Savine had more\nmanners, money and beauty in one quim hair than Vick could’ve dug from\nher whole acquaintance. She sat safe on invisible cushions of power and\nprivilege, knowing she could buy and sell Vick on a whim.\nSavine offered the box to Tallow. “How about you, young man?”\nA blotchy flush spread across his cheeks. As if a goddess had floated\nfrom the heavens to offer him eternal life. “I…” He glanced at Vick. “Can I\ntake one?”\n“If Lady Savine says you can take one, you can take one.”\nSavine smiled wider than ever. “You can take one.”\nHe reached out with a trembling hand, prised one from the fancy paper,\nthen sat staring at it.\n“That sweet probably cost more than your shoes,” said Vick.\nTallow lifted up one dirty boot, its creased tongue hanging out like a\nthirsty dog’s. “They were free. Got ’em off a dead man.” And he stuffed the\nsweet in his mouth. “Oh.” His eyes went even wider. “Oh.” He closed them,\nand chewed, and melted into his seat.\n“Good?” asked Lisbit.\n“Like sunshine,” he mumbled.\n“You really should say thank you.”\n“Don’t worry.” Savine hid it well, but Vick noticed the twitch of\nannoyance on her face. She offered the box again. “You’re sure?”\n“Not for me,” said Vick. “But you’re very kind.”\n“I doubt everyone would agree.”\n“If everyone agreed, I’d be out of a job.” Vick forced herself not to\nwince as she drew in her outstretched leg and slid the window all the way\ndown. “Pull up!” she called to the driver. “We’ll go on foot from here.”\n“It’s true one must be careful who one is seen with.” Savine opened her\neyes very wide as the carriage rattled to a halt. “My mother likes to tell me\na lady’s reputation is all she has. Ironic, really. Her reputation is dismal.”\n“Sometimes you don’t value a thing till you’ve thrown it away,”\nmuttered Vick.\nValbeck was hidden behind the hills to the north as she hopped down\ninto the rutted mud, but she could see the smoke from the city’s thousands\nof chimneys, spreading on the breeze to make a great dark smudge across\nthe sky. Maybe she could smell it, too. Just an acrid tickle at the back of her\nthroat.\n“Is that all your luggage?” asked Savine as Tallow dragged their stained"

Just an acrid tickle at the back of her\nthroat.\n“Is that all your luggage?” asked Savine as Tallow dragged their stained\nbags down from the mass of boxes on the roof.\n“We travel light,” said Vick, pulling on her battered coat and giving her\nshoulders the labourer’s hunch that went with it.\n“I envy you that. It sometimes seems I can’t leave the house without a\ndozen trunks and a hat stand.”\n“Wealth can be quite a burden, eh?”\n“You’ve no idea,” said Savine as Lisbit swung the door shut.\n“Thanks for the sweet, my lady,” croaked out Tallow.\n“Such wonderful manners deserve a reward.” And Savine tossed the box\nthrough the window.\nTallow gave a little gasp as he caught it, fumbled it, managed to stop it\nfalling and finally clasped it tight to his chest. “Don’t know what to say,” he\nbreathed.\nSavine smiled. Open, and easy, and full of opulently polished pearly\nteeth. “Then silence is probably your best option.” It nearly always was, in\nVick’s opinion. Savine touched her fan to the brim of her perfect little hat.\n“Happy hunting.”\nFan snapped, whip cracked and the carriage lurched on towards Valbeck.\nTallow watched it go in sad silence, shading his eyes against the midday\nglare. Vick shook her hair out, stuck her hand in the ditch beside the road\nand made sure she combed dirty water through to the ends.\n“You really have to do that?” asked Tallow.\n“We’re among the desperate now, boy,” she said, putting some\nlabourer’s gravel in her voice. “Need to look like it.” And she reached out\nand smeared mud down his cheek.\nHe sighed as Savine’s carriage was lost behind some trees, that fancy\nbox still clasped tight.\n“Never met anyone like her,” he whispered.\n“No.” Vick slapped some life into her stiff leg, sniffed, hawked and spat\non the road. Then she snapped her fingers at Tallow. “Give us one of those\nsweets, then.”\nFriends Like These\nT\nhe Vallimir residence, high on the hill where most of the affluent citizens\nof Valbeck had their houses, was a lesson in the dangers of excessive wealth\nand inadequate taste. Everything—furniture, cutlery and guests most of all\n—was too weighty, too fancy, too shiny. Mistress Vallimir’s dress was a\nmisjudged purple, the curtains a garish turquoise, the soup a lurid yellow.\nThe colour of urine with a taste not far removed.\n“I’ve never known such a hot spell!” clucked the lady of the house,\nfanning herself ever more vigorously.\n“Oppressive,” said Superior Risinau, head of Valbeck’s Inquisition,\ndabbing a dewy sweat from his plump cheeks that instantly sprang back.\n“Even for the season.”\nIt was very far from helping that Savine’s menses were now in full and\nparticularly brutal first-day flow.

Even bundled in a triple napkin, she would not have\nbeen at all surprised, on getting up, to find she had left a great bloody smear\nacross the Vallimirs’ tasteless upholstery. A contribution to the party to live\nlong in the memory. She had to suppress a wince at a particularly sharp\npang, set down her overembellished spoon and slid her bowl away.\n“Not hungry, Lady Savine?” asked Colonel Vallimir, peering down from\nthe head of the table.\n“Everything is delicious but, alas, as I get older, I must take ever greater\npains over my figure.”\nRisinau gurgled out a chuckle. “Not a consideration I trouble myself\nwith!”\nSavine plastered a smile over her disgust as she watched him slurp from\nhis spoon like a hog from a trough. “How fortunate for you.” And how\nrepugnant for everyone else.\nLord Parmhalt, the city’s mayor, teetered on the verge of slumber.\nMistress Vallimir pretended not to notice as he drifted towards her, in\nimminent danger of slumping into her lap. The draught from her fan had\nloosened some strands of grey hair previously plastered across his bald pate\nand they now floated from his head to an impressive height. For the tenth\ntime that evening, Savine wished she had stayed in Adua. Probably curled\nup in an aching ball with the curtains closed, giving vent to a torrent of\nobscenities. But she flatly refused to be a slave to her tyrant of a womb.\nBusiness came first. Business always came first.\n“And how is business?” she asked.\n“Positively booming,” said Vallimir. “The third shed is up and running\nand the mill working at full capacity. Costs down, profits up.”\n“The very directions for costs and profits that I like.”\nVallimir gave something between a cough and a chuckle. He was a man\nwith a fragile sense of humour. “All good news. As I told you in my letter.\nNothing to worry about.”\n“Oh, I can always find something to keep me awake at night,” said\nSavine. Even if it was only a constant grinding ache through her stomach\nand down the backs of her legs.\nPerhaps it was her presence, but there was a nervous edge to the\ngathering. The talk too urgent, the laughter too shrill, the staff twitchy as\nthey whisked the soups away. Savine’s eye was caught by the glint of metal\nat the window: a pair of guards patrolling the grounds. There had been four\nof them at the door when she arrived, accompanied by a sullen monster of a\ndog.\n“Are all the armed men really necessary?” she asked.\nShe was gratified to note the twitch of dismay on Vallimir’s face. As if\nhe had sat on a pin. “Given your position in society, given the envy that\nmight be directed towards you, given… who your father is, I thought we\ncould not be too careful.”\n“One can never be too careful,” echoed Superior Risinau, leaning close\nto touch Savine’s shoulder with entirely too much familiarity. “But you\nneed have no fear, Lady Savine.”\n“Oh, I am not easily intimidated. I receive at least a dozen threats a day."

Angry\ncompetitors, jealous rivals, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners,\ndisappointed suitors. If there was money in threats, I would be…” She\npaused a moment to consider it. “Even richer, I suppose. I swear, I receive\nmore venom even than my father. It has made me realise there is only one\nthing men hate more than other men.”\nThere was an expectant pause. “Which is?” asked Mistress Vallimir.\n“Women,” said Savine, shifting in her uncomfortable chair. If a man was\nstruck in the balls during a fencing match, he would be expected to howl\nand weep and roll around, while his opponent gave him all the time he\nneeded and the crowd murmured their sympathy. If, during days of monthly\nagonies, a woman once let her smile sour, it would be considered a\ndisgrace. She forced her own smile wider while the sweat sprang out of her.\n“I suppose the bars on the windows were installed for my benefit, too?”\n“Here on the hill…” Mistress Vallimir leaned around the nodding mayor,\npicking her words as carefully as mossy stepping stones on the way across a\nriver, “we are all obliged to take great care over our security.”\n“Three weeks ago,” squeaked Condine dan Sirisk, mousy wife of a mill\nowner kept away by business, “a factory owner was killed. Murdered in his\nown house!”\n“A robbery.” Risinau licked his lips as little purple jellies began to be\ndelivered to the far end of the table. “A botched burglary, plain and simple.”\nHe leaned across to give Savine a reassuring pat on the forearm, enveloping\nher in his rosewater and sour-sweat scent. “We’ll ferret out the perpetrators,\ndon’t worry about that.”\n“So… there are no Breakers in Valbeck?”\nEvery face turned towards Savine, then silence, the only movement the\nwobbling of those horrible little jellies.\n“Only a few weeks ago, a plot was foiled in Adua to blow up a foundry\nusing Gurkish Fire,” she went on. Mistress Sirisk pressed a hand to her\nchest and gasped. Less fear at the news, by the look of things, than near-\nsexual delight at the prospect of sharing it with her entire social circle by\nnoon tomorrow. Savine gave her a conspiratorial wink. “I have some\ncontacts in the Inquisition.”\n“Well,” grumbled Vallimir, looking rather put out. He appeared to be one\nof those men who was put out whenever a woman opened her mouth. “We\nhave no troubles of that kind here in Valbeck.”\n“None,” frothed Risinau, dabbing a new sheen of sweat from his\nforehead. He was quite obviously hiding something. “There are no\nBreakers, no Burners—”\n“Burners?” asked Savine.\nVallimir and his wife exchanged a worried glance. “Worse scum even\nthan the Breakers,” said the master of the house, reluctantly. “Madmen and"

The Breakers desire…” and he wrinkled\nhis lip with disgust, “to reorder the Union. The Burners desire to destroy it.”\n“Even if you believe such monsters exist, you will find none here,” said\nRisinau. “The workers of Valbeck are without grievances.”\n“In my experience, workers can weave a grievance from the most\nunpromising thread,” said Savine, “and you have a vast number of workers\nhere. Can a city grow so fast without troubles?”\nLord Parmhalt jolted awake. Possibly as a result of Mistress Vallimir’s\ncarefully applied elbow. “Great strides have been made, Lady Savine.\nThanks in part to generous loans from the banking house of Valint and Balk.\nRecently opened a new branch in the city, you know.” He shook himself,\nthen began once more to sag towards slumber. “You should visit… the new\npart of town.”\n“New streets,” said Vallimir.\n“Model streets,” said Risinau.\n“Closed-in drains,” said the mayor, rousing himself for another heroic\neffort, “and running water to every house, and all manner… of\ninnovations.”\n“In Gurkhul, they build temples,” observed Savine, “in Styria, palaces.\nHere we build drains.” There was a round of polite laughter. She glanced up\nat the maid, just manoeuvring a jelly into place before her with desperate\nconcentration. “Might I ask your name, my dear?”\nShe blinked at Savine, then at Mistress Vallimir, then blushed bright\npink and tidied a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “May, my lady.

Worse vapours even\nthan in Adua.”\nMay swallowed. “So I’m told, my lady.”\n“Don’t worry, you can speak your mind,” said Savine, “I insist on it.\nThere’s really no point otherwise, is there?”\n“Well… my family have a good place on the slope of the hill, now. Very\ngrateful for it.”\n“And what about the old town?”\nMay nervously cleared her throat. “We were there when we first arrived.\nThe old town’s very full, begging your pardon. There are families of six to a\ncellar.”\n“Six to a cellar?” Savine glanced at Vallimir, and he gave that wince\nagain.\n“And the walls running with damp, and children playing in the open\nsewers, and pigs kept in the alleys, and the water from the pumps is far\nfrom healthy.” She was warming to it now, waving her arms in jerky\ngestures. “More people come in every day, and there isn’t work for all of\nthem, and prices for everything are high—”\nHer hand caught Savine’s glass, sent it teetering. She shot her hand out\nas though jabbing with a short steel and caught it before it fell."

She shot her hand out\nas though jabbing with a short steel and caught it before it fell.\nThe maid stared down in horror. “I’m… I’m so sorry—”\n“No harm done. Thank you so much. You can go.”\n“Foolish, wayward girl,” snapped Mistress Vallimir, the moment she had\npulled the overpolished door shut, her fanning turned positively savage.\n“Nonsense,” said Savine, “it was entirely my fault.”\n“Loose hands and a looser tongue. I will let her go in the morning.”\nSavine’s voice had a sudden sharpness. “I would rather you did not.”\nMistress Vallimir bristled. “Pardon me, Lady Savine, but in my own\nhouse—”\n“A beautiful house in which I am honoured to be a guest. But I asked for\nhonesty. I will not see her punished for it.” The pain had quite ground away\nSavine’s patience. She set her smile aside for once, and made sure she held\nVallimir’s eye. “Please don’t make me insist. Not when we are having such\na lovely evening. If I had been punished every time I spoke truth to an\ninvestor, why, I would never have been able to make you so rich.”\nThere was a long silence, then Risinau leaned close to Savine and put\nhis fat, moist hand on hers. It was like having one’s fingers smothered in old\ndough. “Lady Savine, I give you my personal guarantee, the workers are\ncontent and there is nothing to worry about.”\nIt was his bad luck that this patronising reassurance coincided with a\nparticularly savage cramp, as if there was a fist clenching around her guts.\nSavine leaned towards him, cupping her mouth to keep anyone else from\nhearing, and whispered in his ear. “Touch me again and I will stab you with\nmy fork. In your fat fucking neck. Do you understand?”\nThe Superior swallowed and carefully peeled his hand from hers. Savine\nlooked back to Vallimir. “You said business is good at the mill?”\n“It is.”\n“Then I would very much like to look at the books. I so enjoy the\nsuccessful ones.”\nVallimir gave that twitch again. “I will have them brought to you.”\n“Better if I go to them. Having come all this way, I must see the\nimprovements you have made first hand.”\n“A visit in person…” ventured Vallimir, wincing.\nRisinau took up the challenge. “It might not be the best—”\n“You’ll hardly know I’m there.” And their wanting her to stay away\nmeant she absolutely had to go. “I find, when it comes to business, there is\nnothing like the personal touch.” She took up the absurdly long spoon,\ndelved deep into the jelly and slurped it through pursed lips with great\nrelish.\n“My compliments, Mistress Vallimir, such a delicious jelly.” It was a\nvile jelly. Perhaps the worst Savine had ever had the misfortune to\nconsume. She weathered another stab in her belly and presented the\ngathering with her most glittering smile. “You simply must give my maid\nthe recipe.”\nSinking Ships"

Tallow wolfed his meat and gravy\ndown then watched as Vick ate hers, only just short of drooling like a\nhungry dog. She didn’t like eating with those big sad eyes on her, but she\ntook time cleaning her plate even so. Another habit from the camps. A habit\nfrom never having enough.\nRelish every mouthful, it feels like it goes further.\nThey waited for dusk, though with the smoke over Valbeck it wasn’t\nmuch darker than day and felt even hotter, the sunset an angry, molten-\nmetal smear behind the great chimneys they were building in the west. Then\nthey worked their way into the teeming, steaming backstreets like rats into a\ndungheap, asking roundabout questions, trying to winkle out hints of where\nthe Breakers might be.\nVick had picked over her story a hundred times. Picked over Tallow’s,\ntoo, until the lies were like a second skin, more familiar than the truth. She\nhad an answer for every question, a story for every suspicion, a set of\nexcuses that left her looking good but not too good. The one thing she\nhadn’t been prepared for was the one thing she found.\n“The Breakers?” said a boy-whore, not even bothering to lower his\nvoice. “Expect you’ll find ’em meeting on that little alley off Ramnard\nStreet.” He called out to a girl-whore busy arranging the straps of her dress\nover a bare shoulder dotted with pox-marks. “What’s the name o’ that alley\nwhere the Breakers meet?”\n“Don’t know that it’s got a name.” And she went back to smiling for the\npassing trade.\nAll careless as if the Breakers were a sewing circle rather than a mob of\nrenegades ripping up the fabric of society. Old Sticks had called Superior\nRisinau a fat man prone to folly, with no imagination but plenty of loyalty.\nFrom the careless way folk spoke of treason here, he’d let things get far out\nof hand in Valbeck.\nThe whores nodded them towards a smirking pimp. After a little\nbargaining, the pimp pointed out a beggar with one arm. For a few bits, the\nbeggar sent them to an out-of-work smith selling matches from a stall on\nwheels. The smith nodded them down an alleyway towards an old\nwarehouse. A big man stood outside its door, light from an upstairs window\nreflected in a pair of round eye-lenses that looked tiny on his broad skull.\nVick knew right off he could be trouble. The size of him, yes, almost a\nhead taller than her, and his threadbare jacket stretched tight over great\nbrawny shoulders. But it was more the look he had when he saw her\ncoming. Apologetic, almost. None of that peacock strut men who think\nthemselves hard put on. That hint of guilt the really dangerous ones tend to\nhave.\nShe knew it from the mirror, on her bad days.\nAnd if she’d had any doubts, there was the tattoo on his fist, before he"

Axe and lightning, crossed over a shattered\ngatehouse. Blue stars on the knuckles. On all the knuckles. So he’d been a\nLadderman. First up the walls in a siege. Front of the storming party. He’d\ndone it five times and lived to tell the tales. Or, more likely, to never speak\nof it again.\nIt was a habit from the camps to think about how she’d bring a man\ndown. This one you’d make sure was on your side. Or run away from him,\nfast as you could. Whole thing felt like a trap to Vick. But then everything\ndid, and she told herself that was a good thing. It’s the moment you feel safe\nthat you make your last mistake.\n“My name’s Vick. This is Tallow.” The Breakers kept to first names, in\nthe main.\nThe big man looked them over, those guilty eyes made small by his\nlenses. “I’m Gunnar.”\n“We’ve come from Adua.” She leaned close to murmur, “We were\nfriends of Collem Sibalt.”\n“All right.” He looked more puzzled than suspicious, as if it wasn’t\nreally his business. “Good for you.”\n“Aren’t you guarding the door?”\n“Just came out for some air. Getting too hot for me in there.” And he\ntugged at his collar. “That Judge woman makes me…” He paused, mouth\nopen, like he couldn’t quite work out what this Judge woman made him.\n“Well, can’t say I like the way things are. Wouldn’t be here otherwise. But I\ncan’t see her making ’em better.”\nVick leaned close to him, dropping her voice. “Aren’t you worried about\nthe Inquisition?”\n“Must admit I am, but no one else seems to be.” And he nudged the door\nopen with his tattooed hand, and offered them the way.\nVick didn’t speak much, but that was a choice. Actually being lost for\nwords was rare with her. All she could manage as she stepped over the\nthreshold of that warehouse, though, was, “Shit.”\n“Aye.” Tallow’s eyes had gone wider than ever. “Shit.”\nMust’ve been five hundred people crowded close in there. It was hot as\nan oven and noisy as a slaughterhouse and it smelled of old tar, unwashed\nbodies and rage. It was ill-lit by torches and the flickering of fire lent\neverything an edge of madness. Against one wall, someone had unfurled a\nhuge banner made from old bedsheets, the words Now or Never daubed\nacross it.\nSome children had climbed up to sit on the high rafters, legs dangling,\nand for a moment, Vick thought they had a row of hanged men below them.\nThen she saw they were straw dummies, with leering painted faces. The\nking and queen, with wooden crowns over their eyes. A bloated Lord\nChancellor Gorodets, a twisted Arch Lector Glokta. The bald one with a\nstick in his hand she reckoned must be Bayaz, First of the Magi. The great\nand good of government, mocked in the open."

The great\nand good of government, mocked in the open.\nThey’d drawn up an old wagon to serve as a stage, and a woman stood\nthere now giving as wild a performance as any actress, one thin hand\nclutching at the rail while she tore at the air with the other.\nJudge, Vick reckoned, and she had a sense for theatre. She wore an old,\nscarred breastplate rusty at the rivets over a ragged red dress that might\nonce have been some noblewoman’s wedding gown. She had a mass of\nflame-red hair all braided and coiled and pinned into a mad tangle. Her eyes\nbulged, huge in her bony, blotchy face, black, and empty, catching the torch\nflames so it looked as if she had fire in her skull. Maybe she did at that.\n“The time for talk’s long past!” she screamed in a wild, piercing voice\nthat made Vick wince. “Nothing was ever got with talk…” Judge let it hang\nthere a moment, head cocked to one side, a brittle smile quivering on her\nlips. “That couldn’t be got with fire.”\n“Burn ’em!” someone shouted.\n“Burn the mills!”\n“Burn the owners!”\n“Burn it all!” squealed one of the children from the rafters, so excited\nshe nearly fell, and others took up the chant.\n“Burn it! Burn it! Burn it!” Fists punched at the air, tattooed writing on\nbared forearms. Like the rebels in Starikland used to have. Treasonous\nslogans, proudly on display. Weapons, too, thrust up from the crowd in time\nwith the chanting, and not just workmen’s tools sharpened for a show.\nPolearms. Swords. At least one flatbow. Soldiers’ weapons, made for\nkilling.\n“What did I tell you?” The man called Gunnar was standing next to her,\nshaking his head as he watched Judge prowl the stage, urging the crowd\nlouder.\n“If I’d known it was fancy dress,” murmured Vick, “I’d have made more\neffort.”\nShe could dig out a smart comment when she had to, but in truth she\nwas way off balance. She’d been expecting the Breakers in Valbeck to be a\ndozen blowhard fools like Grise, hiding in a cellar and arguing over what\ncolour to paint a fine new world that’d never come. Instead she found them\narmed and organised in numbers, preaching open rebellion. She was off\nbalance, and she wasn’t used to it, and her mind raced to catch up.\n“Hold up, now!” And an old man hauled himself onto the wagon beside\nJudge. “Hold up!”\n“That’s Malmer,” said Gunnar, leaning down towards Vick’s ear. “He’s a\ngood man.”\nHe was Judge’s opposite. Big and solid and dressed in plain work\nclothes, face lined from years of labour and his balding hair iron-grey, all\nice-water calm to her burning fury. “You can always find folk keen to start\nfires,” he said, turning to the sweltering warehouse. “Finding folk to build\nin the ashes is harder.”\nJudge folded her arms across her battered breastplate and sneered at"

Lived here all my life. You think I like the way it’s changed? Think I\nlike the river running with filth or the streets knee deep in rubbish?” With\neach phrase his voice grew louder, with each phrase an answering grumble\nswelled from the crowd. “Think I like to see good folk put out of work at\nthe whim of some bastards born to privilege? Our rights stripped away for\nthe sake o’ their greed? Good folk treated like cattle?”\n“Fuck the owners!” screeched Judge, and the crowd cheered and jeered,\nwailed and grumbled.\n“There’s men here turn out miles of cloth a day but can’t afford a shirt\nfor their backs! Women whose highest ambition is to con the factory\ninspector that her son’s old enough to work! How many fingers missing\nhere? And hands? And arms?” And people held up stumps and crutches and\nmangled hands, veterans not of battles but endless shifts at the machinery.\n“There are folk dying o’ hunger just a mile from the palaces on the hill!\nBoys who can hardly breathe for the white lung. Girls who catch some\nowner’s fancy and are forced into night-work. You know the sort o’ work I\nmean!”\n“Fuck the owners!” screeched Judge again, and the crowd’s rage came\nback louder than ever.\n“There’ll be a reckoning!” Malmer clenched his fists as he glowered at\nthe crowd, his grinding anger every bit as worrying as Judge’s stabbing\nfury. “I promise you that. But we need to think. We need to plan. When we\nspill our blood—and blood’ll be spilled, depend on that—we need to make\nsure it buys us something.”\n“And we will! No less than everything!” A smooth voice rang out, a\ncultured voice, and the crowd fell quickly silent. A mood of expectation,\npeople hardly daring to breathe.\nJudge grinned as she held out her hand to pull someone up onto the\nwagon. A plump man in a dark, well-tailored suit, soft and pale, oddly out\nof place in this rough company.\n“Here he is,” murmured Gunnar, folding his arms.\n“Here who is?” whispered Vick, though from that silence she already\nguessed the answer.\n“The Weaver.”\n“Friends!” called the plump man, stroking gently at the air with his thick\nfingers. “Brothers and Sisters! Breakers and Burners! Honest folk of\nValbeck! Some of you know me as Superior Risinau of His Majesty’s\nInquisition.” And he held up his pink palms, and gave a sorry smile. “For\nthat I can only apologise.”\nVick could only stare.

No imagination, but plenty of\nloyalty. For the first time in Vick’s memory, it appeared His Eminence had\nmade a most serious misjudgement.\n“I wrote to the king a few weeks ago,” called Risinau, “laying out our\ngrievances. Anonymously, of course. I did not deem it appropriate to use\nmy given name.” Some laughter through the crowd. “The ever-dwindling\npay. The ever-swelling cost of living. The appalling quality of lodgings. The\nfoul air and water. The sickness, squalor and hunger. The cheating of\nworkers through false measures and hidden deductions. The oppression of\nthe employers.”\n“Fuck the employers!” shrieked Judge, spraying spit.\nRisinau held up a flapping sheet of paper. “This morning I received a\nreply. Not from His foolish Majesty, of course.”\n“The cock in the Agriont!” sneered Judge, grabbing hold of her groin to\nmuch laughter among the crowd while the children jumped on the rafters\nand made the dummy king dance.\n“Not from his Styrian queen,” continued Risinau.\n“The cunt in the palace!” screamed Judge, thrusting her hips at the\ncrowd, and someone worked a thread that pulled the dummy queen’s skirts\nup, showing a great fleece muff to gales of merriment.\n“Not from his dissolute son, Prince Orso.” Risinau glanced expectantly\nover at Judge.\nShe shrugged her bony shoulders. “There’s nothing to say about that\nwaste o’ fucking flesh.” And a wave of boos and jeering swept the crowd.\n“Not from the figureheads,” called Risinau, “but from the pilot of the\nship! From Old Sticks himself, Arch Lector Glokta!” The fury at the name\nwas the loudest yet by far. Just ahead, Vick saw an old man with a bent back\ncurl his lip and spit at Glokta’s twisted dummy in disgust.\n“He offers no help, you will be surprised to hear.” Risinau peered down\nat the letter. “He cautions against disloyalty, and warns of stiff penalties.”\n“Fuck his penalties!” snarled Judge.\n“He tells me the market must be free to operate. The world must be free\nto advance. Progress cannot be chained, apparently. Who knew the Arch\nLector was so firmly set against manacles?” Some laughter at that. “When\none man knowingly kills another, they call it murder! When society causes\nthe deaths of thousands, they shrug and call it a fact of life.” Growls of\nagreement, and Risinau crushed the letter in his fist and tossed it away. “The\ntime for talk is done, my friends! No one is listening. No one who counts.\nThe time has come for us to throw off the yoke and stand as free men and\nwomen. If they will not give us what we are owed, we must rise up and take\nit by force. We must bring the Great Change!”"

Not to burn\nthe city,” and he wagged a disappointed finger at Judge, and she stuck her\ntongue out and spat into the crowd, “but to free the city. To give it back to\nher people. To stand as an example to the rest of the Union.” And the\naudience gave an approving bellow.\n“Wish it was that easy.” Gunnar slowly shook his head. “Doubt it will\nbe.”\n“No,” muttered Vick. She made Tallow wince, she squeezed his arm so\nhard as she marched him over towards the wall to hiss in his ear.\n“Get out of town now, you hear? Head for Adua.”\n“But—”\nShe pressed her purse into his limp hand. “Quick as you can. Go to my\nemployer. You know who I mean. Tell him what you saw tonight. Tell\nhim…” She glanced around, but folk were too busy cheering Risinau’s mad\nspeech to mind her. “Tell him who the Weaver is. I’m trusting you to get it\ndone.”\nShe let him go but he didn’t move, just stared at her with those big eyes\nthat were so like her brother’s. “You’re not coming?”\n“Someone has to try to handle this mess. Go.” She shoved him away,\nwatched him totter towards the door.\nVick wanted to follow. Badly. But she had to get to the hill and find\nSavine dan Glokta, maybe there was still time to put out a warning—\n“This must be Victarine dan Teufel!” She froze at that strangely prim\nvoice. “I had heard you were in Valbeck.” Risinau came smiling through the\ncrowd, dabbing his shining face with a handkerchief, Judge at one shoulder,\nMalmer at the other.\nThere was a hollow feeling in Vick’s guts as dozens of pairs of hard eyes\nturned towards her. Like that moment in the mines, in the dark, the day her\nsister drowned. When she hissed for quiet, and heard the water rushing, far\noff.\nThey had her. She was done.\nRisinau wagged one plump finger. “Collem Sibalt told me all about\nyou.”\nHer heart was thudding so hard she could hardly breathe. Hardly see.\nThe children had pulled down the dummy of Bayaz and were beating it with\nits own staff, straw flying. She couldn’t believe how calm her voice\nsounded. Like someone else’s. Someone who knew exactly what they were\ndoing. “Good things, I hope.”\n“All good things. He said you were a woman with a hard heart and a\nlevel head. A woman as committed to our cause as any. A woman who\ncould keep her wits on a sinking ship.” And Risinau stepped forward and\nfolded her in a smothering hug while she stood there, damp with cold sweat\nand her flesh creeping. “Collem Sibalt was a dear friend.

Her monthly agonies had dwindled to a nagging ache, but the\nsummer heat was more oppressive even than yesterday, and her sense of\nunease had been steadily growing all the way through Valbeck from the hill\nas her carriage clattered down murky streets strangely empty, oddly quiet,\ntowards the river.\nThe three towering sheds were unlovely buildings of soot-streaked\nbrickwork with few windows and no adornments. Even through the thick-\nsoled boots she had chosen, Savine could feel the cobbles of the yard buzz\nwith the movement of the great machines inside. Men slouched sullen about\nthe yard, loading and unloading wagons, grey-clothed and grey-skinned,\nhard eyes turned rudely towards the new arrivals. Savine met the stare of\none and he made a great show of spitting. She was reminded of the\ncharming reception Queen Terez received on her rare appearances before\nthe commoners. At least no one was screaming Styrian cunt! at her. But\nonly, she suspected, because she was not Styrian.\n“The workers appear less than delighted by my visit,” murmured Savine.\nVallimir snorted. “If there is a way to delight the workers, I have yet to\nfind it. Managing soldiers was considerably more straightforward.”\n“One can have perfectly cordial relationships with one’s competitors,\nbut rarely with one’s employees.” Savine glanced over her shoulder at the\nten armoured guards filing through the gate after them, fingers tickling their\nweapons. It did nothing for her nerves that heavily armed men looked even\nmore nervous than she did. “Do we really need such a conspicuous escort?”\n“Merely a precaution,” said Vallimir as he led Savine, Lisbit and the rest\nof their party across the yard. “Superior Risinau suggested you have a\ndozen Practicals about you at all times.”\n“That seems… excessive.” Even for the daughter of the Union’s most"

There was some violence. It became necessary to forbid any\norganising among the workers, though that was made easier by the king’s\nnew laws against congregation.” Savine’s father’s new laws, in fact, which\nshe had taken a personal hand in drafting. “Then the new methods instituted\nin our third shed have caused…” Vallimir frowned towards the newest of\nthe three buildings, longer, lower and with even narrower windows in its\nalready grubby walls. “Considerable ill will.”\n“I often find the more effective the method, the more ill will it causes.\nPerhaps we should begin our tour there.”\nVallimir winced. “I am not sure you would be… comfortable inside.

You remind me of him, in a way. He\nwas a very driven man. Very committed.” Vallimir glanced towards her as\nhe produced a key and unlocked the door. “And he could be quite\nterrifying.” The hum of machinery became a roar as he pushed it wide.\nInside, the whole place shook with the endless anger of the engines. The\nslap of belts, the clatter of cogs, the rattle of shuttles, the shrieking of metal\nunder furious pressure. The manufactory floor was dug deep into the ground\nso they stood at a kind of balcony.

The smell was nauseating, the heat crushing, the noise thunderous,\nthe combination positively hellish.\nShe stifled a cough as she tried to speak again. Even up here on the\nbalcony, the air was heavy with dust, the shafts of light from the narrow\nwindows swarming with motes. “Wages are minimal, I imagine?”\nVallimir gave a strange grimace. “That is the beauty of this scheme.\nAside from a stipend to the poor house from which they are acquired, and\nminimal expenditure on food and clothing, they receive no wages. They\ncan, in effect… be purchased.”\n“Purchased.” Savine let no emotion enter her voice at that word, either.\n“Like any other piece of machinery.”\nShe looked down at her new sword-belt. She had been delighted when it\nwas delivered the other day. Quite the masterpiece. Sipanese leather, with\ngem-studded silver panels showing scenes from the Fall of Juvens. How\nmany children could she have bought for the same money? How many had\nshe bought?\n“We used to employ skilled hand-weavers, but in practice there is little\nneed. Children can learn to mind the machines just as quickly, and with\none-tenth the fuss.” Vallimir gestured towards the whirring engines, the\nlittle figures crawling around them. Though more the gesture of a judge\ntowards a crime than a showman towards a spectacle. “With the improved\nmachinery, plus the lower costs of labour and housing, this shed is more\nprofitable than the other two combined. And far more easily controlled.”\nVallimir nodded down towards a heavyset foreman patrolling the floor.\nBehind his back, Savine saw that he held a stick. Or would one describe it\nas a whip?\n“How long do they work here?” she croaked out, over the hand she had\nunconsciously pressed across her mouth.\n“Shifts are fourteen hours. Any longer has proved unsustainable.”\nShe had boasted of her toughness, but a few moments in there was\nenough to make Savine feel dizzy, and she clutched at the rail. Fourteen\nhours’ hard labour in that dust and noise, day after day. And hot as the\nMaker’s forge, as her father liked to say. She could already feel the sweat\ntickling at her scalp beneath her wig. “Why is it so hot?”\n“Any cooler and the yarn becomes sticky, the machines can be fouled.”\nShe wondered if so much wilful human misery had ever been created in\none space before. She put a hand on Vallimir’s shoulder. “When it comes to\nbusiness, profit is the only right. Loss the only wrong.”\n“Of course.”\nSomething told Savine they both had their doubts. But she could blame\nhim, the bloodless bastard, and he could blame her, the flint-hearted bitch,\nand no doubt the profits would lubricate any grinding gears in both their\nconsciences. If they did not make efficiencies, after all, there would always"

If they did not make efficiencies, after all, there would always\nbe some other owner whose stomach had been strengthened by failure.\nWould their workers weep for them when they went out of business? Or\nwould they rush to find some new employer to whine their petty grievances\nat?\n“Well done,” she shouted in Vallimir’s ear, though her voice sounded\nsomewhat strangled. The heat, of course, and the noise, and the dust. “I\nasked you to make a profit and you have done so, regardless of sentiment.”\n“Sentiment is even more dangerous in a mill owner than a soldier.”\nThey were cooking something somewhere, and Savine caught a whiff of\nit. Like the food they gave her mother’s dogs on the estate. She pressed one\nhand to her still-aching stomach, but hardly felt it through the bones of her\ncorset. She wondered about her button and buckle manufactory in\nHolsthorm, where little fingers were best suited to little tasks. Was it like\nthis? Was it worse? She licked her lips, swallowed sour spit.\n“You might consider improving their conditions, however. Perhaps some\nseparate living quarters could be constructed in the yard? Somewhere clean\nfor them to sleep. Better food.”\nVallimir raised one brow.\n“Luxury is wasteful,” said Savine, “but hardship can reduce\nproductivity. In my experience, there is a balance to be struck. With better\nconditions, you might manage longer shifts after all.”\n“An interesting suggestion, Lady Savine.” Vallimir nodded slowly as he\nlooked down at the children, jaw-muscles working. It should have been a\nheartbreaking spectacle. But there is no room in business for hearts. Not\nones easily broken, anyway.\nShe hitched up the corners of her smile. “If I might look over the books\nnow?”\nA great frame occupied the middle of the first and largest shed, a\nspinning shaft through its centre that brought power from the river, via an\nengineer’s nightmare of cogs, gears, cranks, belts, to the great looms that\nran in two rows along the floor. A web of thread was reeled in from giant\nspindles, cloth of different patterns and colours grinding off the rollers.\nAround the looms the men were gathered, sweat-beaded and grease-\nsmeared, tight-lipped and hard-eyed. If the occupants of the third shed had\nbeen apt to break her heart, she imagined the occupants of the first would\nrather smash her skull.\nSavine did not expect affection from the workers. She had made her\nreputation from flagrant displays of wealth, after all, and those tended to sit\nbadly with the poor. But there was something about the way these particular\nmen watched her. A cold, quiet focus to their fury more troubling than any\noutburst. Rather than too many guards, she began to wonder whether they\nhad brought too few.\nShe touched Lisbit gently on the elbow. “Would you mind stepping\noutside and bringing the carriage to the gate?”\nThe heat had turned Lisbit’s rosy cheeks an angry, blotchy red. “Sure we\nshouldn’t leave now, my lady?” she muttered, worried eyes darting to the\nworkers.\nSavine kept blandly smiling. A lady of taste always smiles. “Better not"

To our employees or our partners.” She was not a\nwoman to be deterred by hatred: not from her workers, not from her rivals,\nnot from the men she bullied, bribed or blackmailed to get her way. It is\nwhen they truly hate you, after all, that you know you have won. So she met\nthe seething dislike with effortless superiority, paraded past with her\nshoulders back and chin high. If she was to be cast as the villain, so be it.\nThey were always the most interesting characters anyway.\nVallimir’s office was at the very end of the shed, a kind of box up on a\nframe with barrels and crates stacked haphazardly beneath, a balcony\noutside from which an owner might look down upon their employees like a\nking upon his subjects. Or an empress upon her slaves.\nThe colonel bowed stiffly as he offered her the way up. “Take as long as\nyou need.” He turned to frown at the scores of sullen workmen. “Though\nperhaps no longer.”\nThe door was fitted with two locks and a heavy bar, so sturdy it was an\neffort for Savine to swing it shut. She tore open the hook at the collar of her\njacket, trying to flap some air onto her sweaty neck, but the atmosphere in\nthe office was hardly less stifling than on the manufactory floor, the nerve-\nshredding chatter of the machines hardly less oppressive.\nA loose board groaned under her boot as she made her way to Vallimir’s\ndesk and its cargo of ledgers. She hated to see anything shoddily made,\nespecially in a building she had helped pay for, but at that moment she had\nlarger worries. She slipped past the desk to the window, one hand rubbing at\nher throat where the worry had become an almost painful pressure.\nThe street outside was deserted. All at work, of course, and what but\nwork would bring anyone to this lane of spiked walls and barred gates, of\ntowering mills and rumbling machinery? Yet there was something wrong\nabout the quiet. A weight on the air, like the calm before a thunderstorm.\nSavine frowned out at the empty lane, biting at her lip, wondering if she\ncould leave now without—\nA man slipped around the brick corner of the next mill. Others followed,\na group of twenty or more. Working men in colourless clothes, much like\nthe ones Savine had seen in Holsthorm, in Adua, in all the cities of the\nUnion. Much like the ones at work below, but moving furtively, as if they\nwere one animal with one purpose.\nThen she caught a glint of bright steel and became aware, with a strange\nshiver, that they were all armed. Some carried sticks beside their legs, some\nheavy tools. The leader had what was quite clearly an old sword. He\nknocked at a gate in the wall; it swung open as if by prior arrangement and\nthe men rushed inside.\nShe spun around at a shout from the shed behind her, then more, and\nlouder.

She crept to the\ndoor, put a tentative hand to the latch, wanting to open it, fearing to open it.\n“Back!” she heard Vallimir roar as she eased it open. “Back, damn you!”\nThe workers had abandoned their tasks and crowded towards that end of\nthe mill, a solid mass of men all facing her, faces twisted with anger, tools,\niron bars and stones gripped in their fists. Her jaw dropped.\nVallimir’s guards were holding them back in a desperate crescent at the\nbottom of the steps but they were outnumbered twenty-to-one. Savine’s\neyes darted in horror over that ugly swarm. That mob.\nVallimir stood facing them on the balcony, the back of his neck turning\nred as he bellowed at them. “Step away at once!”\nA man in a stained vest whose arms looked like they were made from\nold rope pointed at Vallimir with a club and screamed, “You step away, you\nold fucker!”\nThings began to flicker up from the crowd: thrown stones, thrown tools,\nthrown bits of machinery, bouncing from the walls of the office, clattering\nfrom the guards’ armour.\nSomething knocked Vallimir’s hat off and he sank down with his hand\nclapped to his bloody scalp. A bottle shattered next to the door and Savine\nheaved it shut, dropped the heavy bar and backed into the room. In spite of\nthe stifling heat, she felt cold to her shaved scalp. She had expected an ugly\nscene on the way out, perhaps, insults hurled and surly men dragged to the\ncells while she glided back to luxury, unruffled. How could she have\nexpected this? An armed insurrection!\nShe could hear her own snatched breath. The breath of a hunted animal.\nFoolishly, with fumbling fingers, she drew her sword. That was what one\nwas supposed to do when one’s life was in danger. Was her life in danger?\nThe noise was louder outside, closer. Over the endless whirr of the\nmachinery she heard screaming, swearing, mindless growling, the clash of\nsteel. A long, high shrieking started which would not stop.\nShe needed to piss, needed to piss terribly. The sword’s grip was\nslippery in her suddenly sweaty palm. Her eyes darted to the windows.\nFitted with heavy grates. To the furniture. Nowhere to hide she would not\nbe found in an instant. To the floor… and the loose board.\nShe threw herself onto her knees, prising at the wood with her fingertips,\nwith her polished fingernails. She clenched her teeth as she worked her\nfingers under the board, heedless of the tearing splinters, worked the point\nof her sword into the gap, hammering at the pommel with the heel of her\nhand.\nSavine jerked her head up at a voice outside. “Open the door, darlin’.”\nSyrupy, but with an edge of menace. The voice of a slaughterman coaxing a\npiglet back into the pen. “Open the door, we’ll be gentle. Make us break it,\nmaybe we break you, too.” Rough giggling, and Savine jumped at a blow"

A glimpse of the dusty boxes below between\ntwo joists. Wide enough to wriggle through? She fumbled at the buttons on\nher jacket, bleeding fingertips leaving red smears on the material, and tore it\noff. She wrestled the silver buckle of her lovely sword-belt open and flung it\naway. The sword she dropped through the hole, its clatter drowned out by\nthe clattering of the machines. No time for preparations. No time for doubts.\nShe swung her legs into the gap, started to slide through. Far from ladylike,\nbut there is no ladylike way to escape from a gang of killers.\n“I’m going to count to five, bitch!” That voice from outside the door,\nboiling over with violence now. “Five, then we’re coming in!”\n“Count to a thousand, you cunt!” she snarled as she worked her hips into\nthe hole, tight, too tight, boards digging at her through her clothes.\n“One!”\nShe was stuck fast. She clenched her teeth, squirmed desperately,\nclutched at the joists and tried to haul herself through.\n“Two!”\nShe gave a growl and with a mighty ripping of cloth tore through,\nscraped one shoulder, caught her chin on timber as she fell, flopped down\non her side below, head cracking against the rim of a barrel.\n“Three!” she heard faintly through the ringing in her ears.\nShe pushed herself up, groggy. She couldn’t see, felt a stab of panic.\nTouched a trembling hand to her eyes. Her wig was skewed across them.\nShe ripped it off, threw it down. She was trapped by something. Her torn\nskirt, snagged on a nail head above. She clawed at the laces and slithered\nfree of it, left it hanging behind her.\n“Four!”\nShe saw her sword gleaming in the shadows, closed her fist around the\ngrip and started to crawl, keeping low, slithering along in the dust behind\nthe barrels. That unearthly shrieking was still going on, pausing every now\nand then for a whooping breath then starting again.\n“Five!” She heard the door of the office tremble from a blow, the bar\nrattle in its brackets.\nShe’d cut her palm, somehow, torn two of her fingernails half-off, was\nleaving blood on everything she touched, dabs and smears of it across her\npetticoats. That would be hell to get out. Hell to get out. She had to get out.\nShe crawled on, head pulsing, shoulder throbbing, jaw aching, hips\ngrazed raw, crawled as fast as she could, tongue pressed into her teeth,\ncrawled, blood tickling at her eyebrow, catching glimpses between the\nbarrels as she went.\nVallimir being dragged away, bloody head lolling.

A worker cackling as\nhe waved the colonel’s hat around, impaled on the end of a huge knife. One\nof the guards, lying still, helmet torn off, hair matted and a dark pool around\nhis broken head. Another on hands and knees, men gathered around, hitting\nhim lazily with sticks which clanged off his dented armour.\nHe stumbled up, putting out a groggy arm to steady himself, was jerked\noff his feet as his hand was caught between two cogs, dragged into the\nmidst of the machinery. He gave a great high-pitched scream as his arm was\ncrushed, hauled into the gears up to the shoulder, blood spattering his face.\nSavine felt spots of it on her own cheek, but no one heard her gasp over the\nnoise of the tortured machinery, of the tortured man.\nThere was a lurch, a slow grinding, the guard’s scream turning to a\nbubbling wail, then the machinery lurched on, wheels turning. Savine tried\nnot to look. Keep her eyes ahead. This wasn’t happening. None of it was\nhappening. How could it be happening? Men were shouting. Barking like a\npack of dogs. She couldn’t make out words, only anger and the shuddering\nblows on the door above.\nShe followed the main driveshaft with her eyes, saw it disappear through\na dark hole in the brickwork on the other side of the looms. Perhaps she\ncould crawl to it, in the shadowy, dusty space below the gears. Through\nthere. Perhaps through there.\nShe wriggled under the rollers on her belly. Ambitious as a snake, now\nshe slithered like a snake, like a worm, wet with sweat in the sticky heat,\nprickling with fear as the frames rattled and whirred around her. She could\nsee a lad through the turning machinery, chink of light across his eager face,\nbut he was staring towards the office. They all were. Staring like wolves at\nthe henhouse. Waiting for the door to give. So they could drag her out.\nShe crawled on, broken fingernails clutching, on through a great spatter\nof that guard’s blood, on under the great shaft that brought power into the\nshed, twinkling with grease as it madly spun, dust puffing from the floor\nwith her every whimpering breath.\nAt any moment, she expected the delighted scream. There she is! At any\nmoment, she expected rough hands to close around her ankle. Bring the\nbitch out! Her sweating back tingled in anticipation of it. Her chest heaved,\ncoughing and shuddering from the dust as she struggled on, biting her\ntongue, trying to smother the desperate fear.\nWhen she finally reached the hole in the wall, she almost sobbed with\nrelief. Clutched at the ragged bricks and dragged herself through, tumbled\ninto a dark passageway, sprawled in ankle-deep water and took a fetid\nmouthful, spat it out, retching.\nThe place was dark, only a flickering glimmer at the edges of damp\nbricks, throbbing with the noise of machines, echoing with distorted"

Whirring,\ncreaking, thrashing timbers, light stabbing between the black beams, water\nfoaming as the slats of the wheel plunged into the river, showering spray as\nthey thrust out again in a rain of shining drops.\nThe wheel might have been four times as high as a man. There was no\nway through it. But between its endlessly moving timbers and the slimy\nwall of the mill, there was a gap. A gap beyond which she saw muddy\ndaylight, the faintest hint of a shingle beach.\nShe glanced back down the shadowy tunnel. No sign of pursuit. But the\ndoor would not hold for ever. They would be coming. And if they caught\nher…\nCould she slide between the wheel and the wall? Was it possible?\nShe pressed her tongue into the roof of her mouth as she tried to judge\nthe gap. What if she did not fit? Would she be dragged under and drowned?\nDragged into the gears and ripped limb from limb? Would her skull be\ncrushed like a walnut between wheel and supports? Would she be slashed,\ncut, nipped and nibbled as she struggled to get free, bleeding to death from\na hundred wounds while she was spun helplessly over, and over, and over?\nShe thought of that guard’s despairing wail as his arm was crushed by the\nmachinery. But there was no other choice.\nShe pressed herself against the wall, breath shuddering through her teeth\nwith fear and exhaustion, and slowly, by tiny degrees, eased one shoulder\naround the corner. She lowered one filthy boot into the river, fishing for the\nbottom, fishing, sodden petticoats clinging to her trembling leg as she eased\nin to the thigh and found mud. She wormed herself on, sticking to the\ncorner, clinging to it with her shoulder blades as if her life depended on it.\nWhich it did.\nShe tried desperately, pointlessly to suck herself in, suck herself flat,\nclutching at the sodden grip of her sword, chewing on her lip with fearsome\nconcentration, sunlight flashing and flickering through the spinning bars.\nShe trusted to her footing on the muddy river bottom and gradually,\ngradually slipped her other leg in, taking a fistful of her petticoats and\ndragging them hard against her in case they floated into the wheel and\nsnatched her to her death. Killed by her own clothes fleeing a textile mill.\nThere was a joke there somewhere.\nShe gasped as a bolt sticking proud of the wood caught her chest, ripped\nsome embroidery free and nearly dragged her into the thrashing timbers of\nthe wheel.

She\ndragged herself up onto wet shingle on quivering hands and knees. For a\nmoment, she wanted to kiss the ground. Until she saw the foamy filth that\ncovered it.\nShe looked up, wiping her wet face on the back of one trembling hand.\nThe river slurped past, purple and orange and green with great blooms of\nunnatural colour from the dye-works upstream, bobbing with refuse,\nchurned to stinking froth by dozens of hammering waterwheels. On the left\nbank was a kind of beach, streaked with tidemarks of dead brown weed,\nscattered with the city’s flotsam, with rags and skins and broken chairs and\nsplintered glass and rusted wire and things too far rotted to be identified, all\nvomited up by the tortured waters and pecked at by flocks of birds\nbedraggled to winged rats.\nA bent-backed woman was picking through the rubbish. She stared at\nSavine with wild eyes, stared at the sword she still held in one hand, then\nscuttled away with a bloated sack over one bloated shoulder.\nSavine tottered up the shingle, sodden clothes clinging to her, slapping\nat her. She had to find something she could hide in. She stumbled along,\nturning over tree branches draped with rags, plucking up broken boxes,\ncoughing at the stink of watery rot. Flies buzzed near a corpse—pig or\nsheep or dog, all matted hair and dirty bone.\nSavine caught sight of something beside it. An old coat, one arm torn off\nand the lining hanging out like offal from a carcass, but she seized on it\nwith far greater delight than she might have the latest silks in the clothiers\nof Adua. Those, after all, would not save her life. This might.\nHer boots were so caked with dirt, no one could have told they cost\nmore than a house in this neighbourhood, but her petticoats, filthy with river\nscum, heavy as armour with river water, might give her away. She fumbled\nat the fastenings with bloody fingertips, ended up sawing at them with her\nbent sword. She was left squatting on that vile riverbank in her clinging\ndrawers. Her corset had to stay, ripped open and with one of the bones\npoking out. There was no way she could reach the laces.\nShe dragged the muddy coat over it, a thing not even the old beggar\nwoman had seen any value in. It stank of rot with a chemical edge that\ncaught in her throat, but she was grateful for it. At least no one could\nmistake her for that leader of fashion, that scourge of ballroom and parlour,\nthat terror of inventors and investors, Savine dan Glokta."

Everything\nhurt. She clutched the stinking coat around her, sword tucked out of sight\ninside, and hobbled away leaving two hundred marks’ worth of the finest\nGurkish linen slashed and ruined on the shingle.\nShe clambered up a low wall, into the lane behind the mill. The lane\nwhere she had seen the armed men earlier. She felt something tickle her\nneck. By the Fates, her earrings! The gaudy ones Lisbit had picked. She\nplucked them out, was about to fling them away when she realised what\nthey might be worth. She stuffed them into the torn lining of her corset.\nThe sound of the machines had stopped.

They could smash the whole city for all she cared, as long as they\nleft her in one piece.\nShe crept to the corner of the wall, peered around it towards the gate of\nthe mill.\nThere was the carriage, looking just the way it had when she got into it\nthat morning, driver sitting with his chin squashed into his scarf, one of the\nhorses tossing its head, harness faintly jingling.

Bloody hell, it was hard\nwork. She opened the watch, spent a moment working out what the time\nwas, then snapped it shut with that lovely click. Lady Savine was taking a\nwhile, but she’d wait, of course, that’s what a lady’s companion did. She’d\nwait until the sun went out if she had to. That’s how faithful she was.

She straightened one of the very fine lace cuffs on the very fine new\ndress she was wearing, gave the watch a little pat where it sat above her\nheart, looking so grand on its beautiful chain. Lisbit Beech, lady’s\ncompanion. It just sounded right. She deserved it. More than that bloody\nZuri. What kind of a name was that, anyway? A name you’d give a doll.\nBloody brown witch had everyone convinced she knew best. And now\nshe was bringing her brothers back, too. And Lady Savine had just said,\n“Bring ’em in! Let ’em live here, where the decent folk have to live!” Lisbit\ncouldn’t believe it. As if there weren’t enough of them in Midderland\nalready. She wanted to be kind. She was a generous person. Big-hearted,\nask anyone. Always giving bits to the tramps when she had one spare. But\nthere had to be a limit. Folk in the Union had their own problems, without a\ncrowd of brown bastards flooding in and bringing more. They were\neverywhere now in Adua! There were places in the city a decent person\nhardly dared tread.\nShe slipped her little mirror out to check her face. This damn heat was\nthe worst thing for powder. While she was tutting at the colour in her\ncheeks, she caught a glimpse through the window of some beggar limping\nup the street, making right for the carriage. Some beggar in a filthy coat\nwith one sleeve missing, scrawny arm sticking out. She thought it might be\na woman, and her lip curled with disgust. Filthy, she was, stubble hair caked\nwith shit and blood and who knew what else. She looked diseased. The last\nthing Lisbit needed when Lady Savine got back was some sick cripple with\nher hand out.\nShe snapped the window down and snarled, “Get the fuck away from\nhere!”\nThe beggar woman’s red eyes slid sideways, and she veered away from\nthe carriage and hobbled off, hunching down.\nA moment later, there was a clatter as the door on the other side of the\ncarriage was ripped open. A man ducked in. A big man in worn work\nclothes with a great smear of soot down the side of his face. Barging into\nLady Savine’s carriage, bold as you please.\n“Get out!” snapped Lisbit, furious. But he didn’t get out. More men\ncrowded in behind him, leering faces at the windows, dirty hands reaching\nfor her.\n“Help!” she shrieked, cringing against the door. “Help!” And she kicked\nfuriously at the one with the sooty face, caught him a good one on the jaw,\nbut one of the others grabbed her ankle and they dragged her shrieking right\nout of the carriage and into the gutter and all of a sudden it was like she was\ndrowning in a clutching, stomping sea of hands and boots and furious faces.\n“Where is she?”\n“Old Sticks’ daughter?”\n“Where’s that Glokta bitch?”\n“I’m just the face-maid!” she squealed, no idea what was happening.

The dull thud of it and her head cracked the pavement,\nblood in her mouth. Someone pulled her up by her hair. Rip of stitching.\nThe arm of her jacket was half torn off, lace dangling. Someone was rooting\nthrough her bag, flinging the pretty pots of paint and powder away,\nstomping her brushes into the pavement.\n“Get her inside, we’ll soon find out what she knows.”\n“No!” she squealed, watch chain scraping her face as someone tore it\noff. “No!” They were laughing as they started to drag her through the gate.\n“No!” She tried to cling to the frame, but one had her left arm, another her\nright, a third her left ankle. “No!” Her right shoe kicked helplessly at the\nground. Such a nice shoe. She’d been so proud to put it on.\n“I’m just the face-maid!” she shrieked.\n“Stop!” roared Kurbman, shoving one man out of his way, then another.\n“Stop!” He grabbed one lad, who’d eagerly stuck his hand up the girl’s torn\nskirt, by the throat and threw him to the ground. “Have you forgotten who\nwe are? We’re not animals! We’re Breakers!”\nIn that moment, as their maddened faces turned towards him, he had his\ndoubts. But he kept on shouting anyway. What else could he do?\n“We done this so we wouldn’t be victims. Not so we could make victims\no’ them. We’re better’n that, brothers!” And he tore at the air with his\nhands, trying to make ’em see. “We done this to bring the Great Change!\nFor justice, remember?”\nHe knew better, o’ course. Some done it for justice, some for vengeance,\nsome for profit and some for the chance to run riot, and it wasn’t like there\nwas no room for a mixture. At a time like this, all flushed with victory and\nviolence, even the better ones could turn dark. Still, there were just enough\no’ the first group to get some doubts going.\n“You thinking to let ’er go?” someone asked.\n“No one’s letting anyone go,” said Kurbman. “They’ll be judged with\nthe others. Judged fair. Judged proper.”\n“I’m just the face-maid,” gasped the girl, her powder streaked with tears.\nAt that moment, two of the others came out dragging Vallimir between\nthem, his clothes torn and his face bloody and his eyes barely open. One of\nthe lads spat on him. “Fucking bastard!” growled another.\nKurbman stepped in front of him, hands up. “Easy, brothers.

Two dozen, maybe, a lot of\nfine clothes in disarray and a lot of proud faces bruised, shocked and tear-\ntracked, shackled in pairs to a great length of chain. Five Breakers minding\n’em, home-made manacles hanging from their belts, a hard-faced old\nbastard at the front Kurbman knew from meetings, though he didn’t think\nhe’d ever heard him talk.\n“Brother Lock!” he shouted, and the man held up his shuffling column.\n“You taking these to the Courthouse?”\n“I am.”\n“Got two more for you.” Kurbman pulled the girl free and, in spite of\nthe grumbling from his comrades, gave her over to a man with a blond\nbeard who started shackling her to the chain. Bloody hell, but one of the\nprisoners was Self, the foreman from the third shed at Resling’s\nGlassworks, eyes down and a great bloody welt on his cheek. He was a\ngood man, Self. Always done his best for his people. Kurbman swallowed.\nGetting these folk shackled was the best he could do. Getting anyone\nunshackled would more’n likely see him dead.\n“I’m just the face-maid,” whimpered the girl as they chained Vallimir\nbeside her, head lolling and his hair matted with blood.\nKurbman turned back to the workers, his voice cracking. “We’ve a\nchance to make a better world, brothers! A better world, you understand?\nBut we have to do it right.”\nWith a jerk on the chain, Resling and the rest were set marching again. Or\nstumbling, tottering, weeping and groaning, anyway, watched over by half a\ndozen sinewy men in workmen’s clothes, sticks in their dirty fists.\n“Bastards,” he muttered to himself.\nHe was Karlric dan Resling, and he would see them all hanged.\nThey were dragged past the burning shell of a carriage. Rubbish\nscattered the street. Broken timbers, broken glass. He flinched as something\nburst from an upstairs window—a great desk, tumbling down and\nshattering, papers spilling across the cobbles.\nSome men stood near it, watching. One ate an apple. Another laughed. A\nshrill, nervous kind of laughter.\nThey had burst onto the bridge. His office, that was, but he called it the\nbridge. He’d always loved a maritime metaphor. “Get out, damn you!”\nShouting always made them lower their eyes. “Get out!” But not this time.\nHe had not believed it! He still could not! He was the admiral! He was\nKarlric dan Resling!\nThey had dragged him from behind his desk. “Damn you!” Dragged him\nacross his own deck.

They had\nmanacled him to this damn chain, shackled to two dozen other helpless\nunfortunates like slaves in bloody Gurkhul. “How dare you?”\nIt was a motley group. The man up ahead with the torn coat Resling\nknew by sight. A lawyer, perhaps? Beside him was that idiot’s wife, what\nwas his name? Sirisk? The girl they had just added to the chain looked more\nlike a bloody maid than a lady. Her tear-streaked cheeks were pink as a\nfarm girl’s. Where were they even being taken? There was no sense to it.\nThere was no sense to any of it.\nA woman with a gaudily painted face leaned from a window above,\nlaughing, laughing, flinging great heaps of papers into the air. Accounts.\nReceipts. Deeds. Fluttering like demented confetti, coating the cobbles,\nswirls of elaborate calligraphy smudging in the filth.\nIt was more than a strike. More than a riot. It was not just his mill, or the\nmill next door. The streets were infected by revolution! It was everywhere.\nThe world run mad.\nWhat would his darling Seline have thought to see her beloved city\nbrought to this? She who spent her evenings giving soup to the destitute.\nFeeding the bloody scroungers. Perhaps it was a good thing the grip had\ntaken her in that bitter winter, in spite of all the money he lavished on\ndoctors. For the best. Just as they had said at the graveside.\nDown a side street, he saw men pushing over a wagon, its cargo of\nbarrels bouncing across the cobbles.\n“These bastards!” he snarled at the nearest guard. The nearest Breaker.\nThe nearest traitor. The nearest animal. “I am Karlric dan Resling, and I’ll\nsee you all—”\nThe man punched him. It was so utterly unexpected, he stumbled back\nand sat down hard in the road, nearly dragging the woman in front of him\ndown, too. He sat in the dirt, astonished, blood bubbling from his nose. He\nhad never been punched before. Never in his life. He felt, very strongly, that\nhe never wanted to be again.\n“Get up,” said the man.\nResling got up. There were tears in his eyes. What would his darling\nSeline think if she could see him now?\nHe was Karlric dan Resling. He was the admiral. Wasn’t he?\nHe wasn’t sure any more.\n“Bastards,” whimpered the man beside her, but it was a plaintive little bleat\nnow. Even so, it was tempting fate.\n“Stop it!” Condine hissed at him through her tears. “You’ll only make it\nworse.”\nCould it be worse, though?

Such a charming tinkle the bell always made.\nHer father had always been so impatient when she cried. “Toughen up,\ngirl.” Furious, as though her tears were an unfair attack on him. Sometimes\nhe had cuffed her around the head, but the blows seemed to have made her\nless tough, not more. Her husband had opted for a kind of benign neglect\ninstead. The idea of his being interested enough to hit her was absurd.\nBeing shackled to a chain was the most attention anyone had paid her in\nyears.\nThe line of prisoners shambled past a great manufactory on fire, smoke\nroiling up into the darkening murk, a popping crash as a window shattered,\nshowering glass, gouting flame, smouldering rubbish and laths and bits of\nslate tumbling into the street, and Condine held up a hand against the heat\nof it, drying the tears on her face as fast as she could shed them.\nA workers’ uprising had formed the backdrop to one of her favourite\nbooks, Lost Among the Labourers, in which a beautiful mill-owner’s\ndaughter is saved from a fire by one of her father’s roughest hands. The\nedges of the pages in the passage where she finally yields to him among the\nmachinery had become quite dishevelled. Condine had always particularly\nenjoyed the description of his arms, so strong, so gentle.\nThere were strong arms here. Gentle, no. She saw men kicking wildly at\nthe door of a shop. Others were dragging a carpet from a house. Her\nsmarting, weeping eyes darted to yells, squeals, mad sounds. Petty horrors\neverywhere. No trace of romance in it.\nSome beggar in a filthy coat was skulking along after them. Why? They\nwere going to hell. They had already arrived.\n“Bastards,” sobbed the man behind her.\n“Shush!” Condine snarled furiously at him.\nThe man in front frowned over his shoulder. “Both o’ you shush.”\nColton turned away from the blubbing, whining pair of ’em, shaking his\nhead. There was the trouble with rich folk, they’d no idea how to cope with\nhardship. No practice. He scratched at the sore skin under the shackles.\nHome-made they were, with some rough edges, prone to chafe. But Colton\nwas used to things chafing.\nHe hadn’t wanted to be a guard. But they’d been offering a coat. Plus\nmeals, even if they were bad ones, and pay, even if it was shit. And by then,\nwhat choice did he have?

If the army couldn’t stop this madness, what hope for\nthe rest of them?\nAlways thought he’d be a weaver, like his old man. There’d been these\ngolden years, just after Curnsbick patented his spinning engine, when yarn\ncame spooling out of the new manufactories so cheap they were giving it\naway, and weavers were suddenly in high demand. Dressed like lords,\nthey’d been, and walking with a swagger. And, aye, the spinners had faced\nsome lean times, poor bastards, but that was their problem.\nThen, around the time Colton finished his apprenticeship, along came\nMasrud’s weaving engine, and in the length of three summers, the weavers\ngot the way the spinners had before them, which was to say thin. Only\nmade it worse that a lot o’ the spinners had turned their hands to weaving,\nsince that was where the money was, and there was no money there no\nmore.\nSo Colton was out o’ work. Came to Valbeck, where everyone said there\nwas always work, but everyone had the same idea. So he’d become a guard.\nFolk looked at him like that was treachery. But he’d needed the coat. He’d\nneeded the meals. And now he was shackled to a chain along with a load of\nrich bastards. In a cruel joke, they’d even stolen his coat. Hardly seemed\nfair. But then ask the spinners about fair.\nA dog was barking as they shambled up onto the bridge. Frisking\nmaddened around a ruined wagon a bunch of boys were stealing the crates\nfrom, barking at no one, barking at everyone. That woman was still sobbing\njust behind him. No idea how to cope with hardship, the rich. No practice.\nThey’d get some practice now, he reckoned.\n“Wait,” said the Breaker in charge o’ the chain, and the column\nstaggered to a halt on the bridge. Strange thing was, Colton knew him. Lock\nwas his name, he thought. He’d been a weaver, way back when.\nRemembered him and Colton’s old man laughing together at a meeting o’\nthe guild, before his old man died and the guild got broke up. He was a\ngrim-looking bastard now. But a lot of weavers were. Mostly on account of\nMasrud’s weaving engine.\nLock walked to the parapet and frowned down at the water.\nFilthy water, full of foam and rubbish, streaked with glistening oil. He’d\nstood here often. This very spot. Considering the waters. After his wife\ndied. Hard to imagine, in this hot summer, how bitter that winter had been.\nMaybe it was the cold done it, or the hunger, or the grip, or maybe it was\njust the hope bled out of her. Got so she just couldn’t be warmed. Got sicker\nand sicker and then she never woke. His son followed two nights after,\neight years old. His daughter was last to go, just before the thaw.

Hadn’t felt anything for a long time.\n“What are you doing?” one of them asked. The man with the bloody\nmouth. “I demand to know what—”\n“Shut up!” shrieked the girl with the ripped dress and the red cheeks.\n“Shut your fucking hole, you fucker!”\nLock looked at the heavy chain.

She had only followed the prisoners because she hardly knew\nwhat else to do. At least with them ahead, it felt as if she was not quite\nalone. But she could not help them. They could not help her. There was no\nhelp for anyone.\nHer body wanted desperately to run, every muscle aching with tension,\nbut there was nowhere to run to. All she could do was slink down streets\nscattered with torn papers, with upended wagons, slaughtered horses,\nbroken machinery, sword clutched under her fetid rag of a coat, casting\nabout for somewhere to hide. Some hole where she could reason out what\nhad happened, and some way to escape it. Some place the madness had not\nreached. But soon enough she realised it was everywhere. Spread like\nsickness. Like wildfire. The whole city had lost its reason. The whole world.\nShe flinched at a woman’s scream, quickly muffled.

She saw a man duck into an alleyway and followed, nearly ran\nstraight into him as he spun about, a broken-off chair leg in his hand.\n“Get back!” His face was so deranged, he hardly looked human. He\nshoved her and she fell, biting her tongue, sprawling in the street, nearly\ncutting herself on her sword as she rolled in the gutter. Someone kicked her\nin the side as they ran past, tumbled over her. She scrambled up, limping\non, wincing at new bruises.\nCould it have been only that morning she swapped small talk at Mistress\nVallimir’s overdecorated breakfast table?

Why did they hate him?\n“What a day!” someone was screaming. “The Great Change, come at\nlast!”\nHe caught a choking waft of smoke, stared desperately about to see if\nhis pyre had caught light, but no. So many bonfires, glimmering through the\ndesperate tears in his eyes.\n“Help me…” he muttered, to no one. All it would take was a stray torch.\nA stray burning paper on the capricious breeze. A stray spark. And the\nlonger this went on, the wilder they became, the more likely his destruction.\nA woman ripped down her dress and another poured wine over her bared\nbreasts and a man shoved his face between them like a pig into a trough, all\nshrieking with desperate laughter, as if the world would end tomorrow.\nPerhaps it had ended already. The fiddle-player capered past, sawing\ndiscordant music, broken strings dangling from the neck of his instrument.\nAlinghan closed his eyes. It was like some story of the Fall of Aulcus,\nchaos and debauchery on the streets. He had always thought of civilisation\nas a machine, cast from rigid iron, everything riveted in its proper place.\nNow he saw it was a fabric gauzy as a bride’s veil. A tissue everyone agrees\nto leave in place, but one that can be ripped away in an instant. And hell\nlurks just beneath.\n“Stack it up, you bastards!” roared the one they called Sparks, the chief\nBurner, the chief demon, the temporary Glustrod of this square, and men\nand women flung more papers in Alinghan’s face, and they fluttered and\ncurled and whirled on the hot breeze.\n“Help me…” he whispered, to no one.\nOf course they would come. The city watch. The Inquisition. The\nsoldiers. Someone would come. How could they not?\nBut Alinghan was forced to concede, as he looked down in horror at the\nsteadily growing heaps of paper about his legs, that they might come too\nlate for him.\n“The Great Change!” someone shrieked, cackling with mad delight.\n“What a day!”\n“What a day!” bellowed that bastard with the squint. Mally could never\nremember his name. Nasty little bastard, she’d always thought. The sort\nthat’s always peering in at windows, looking for something they can snatch.\n“We’re fucking free!” he shrieked.\nMally wanted to be free. Who doesn’t? In principle. It’s a pretty dream,"

It’s a pretty dream,\nto go running through the flower garden with your hair down. But she didn’t\nwant to be free of getting paid. She’d tried that, and it hurt like you\nwouldn’t believe. That’s how she’d ended up whoring in the first place. No\none had forced her to it, exactly. It was just that a choice between whoring\nand hunger weren’t no choice at all.\nThey’d broken down the door o’ the tapping house and dragged out the\ngentleman callers by the feet, made ’em dance for everyone’s amusement in\nthe glare of the burning bank, dressed, or undressed, however they’d been at\nthat moment. One portly old gent shuffled about the heap of papers with his\nhat still on but his trousers around his ankles. Another fellow, a lawyer, she\nthought, that one who was always going on about charity and liked to cover\nhis face while he was having his cock sucked, was naked as a babe, whip\nmarks on his hairy back glistening in the firelight.\nWatching the regulars dance for her made a nice change, she had to\nadmit, and she wasn’t the least bit arsed if the bank turned to ashes, but\nthere was a worry looming about who was going to pay for her broken door.\nAnd a bigger worry looming behind that one. If they burned all the regulars,\nwho’d pay for anything tomorrow?\n“The Great Change!” The squinty bastard caught Mally by the arm,\npainfully tight, almost dragged her over. Funny how, whenever men talked\nabout freedom, they never really meant for the women. “What a day, eh?”\nhe shrieked in her face, blasting her with foul breath.\n“Aye,” she said, smiling as she twisted her arm free. “The Great\nChange.”\nWas it a change for the better, though? That was her concern. Maybe\nshe’d wake tomorrow and the world would suddenly have turned sane, and\nsomeone would’ve fixed her broken lock, too. She had her considerable\ndoubts. But what could she do but smile through it and hope for the best?\nLeast at that she had plenty of practice.\nShe saw Sparks watching her. Felt like she had to do something cruel,\nshow she was one of them. The naked lawyer blundered past and she stuck\nout a boot and tripped him. He tumbled over, rolling in the dirt, and she\npointed at him and howled with forced laughter.\nShe didn’t like it any, but a choice between getting hurt and doing the\nhurting weren’t no choice at all. She’d sat at the shitty end o’ that see-saw\noften enough.\n“Up, pig!” someone snarled.\nRandock staggered to his feet, clutching at his side, trying to hold up a\nweak hand and dance at the same time. He’d never been much of a dancer.\nEven with his clothes on. And he was exhausted now, sweating like a hog in\nspite of his nakedness, the old dyspepsia burning up his throat. But\ndyspepsia was the least of his worries.\nThat girl Mally had tripped him, he thought. Now she was pointing,"

He had helped her,\noften. Financial assistance, from the good of his heart. That was why he\nkept coming here. To help these poor girls, driven into lives of debauchery\nby the harsh times. If they wished to express their natural gratitude, he\nwould not demean them by refusing. He had a strong social conscience.\nAnd this was how they repaid him, the ingrate bitches. Fucking filthy\nwhores, the lot of them!\nHe lumbered past the hill of documents they were heaping up around\nthat poor fellow in the cheap suit, tied to a stake like some heretic by\nfanatics in the savage South. Perhaps there were some of Randock’s cases\nin the pyre, ready to be sent up in smoke. The waste of it. The folly! He had\ngiven his life to the law. More charity, on his part. He had sweated on behalf\nof his clients. So conscientious! You’re in good hands with Randock! He\nhad built a reputation on it. Thus the thriving partnership of Zalev, Randock\nand Crun. Zalev died some years ago, of course, taken by the grip in that\ncold winter, but Randock wasn’t paying for a new sign just on his account,\nand Crun was away doing patents. Lot of money in patents these days.\nWith paper and ink one could level mountains, he had always said, if\ngiven the time and appropriate connections about the Courthouse. Nothing\nwas stronger than the law! Now it seemed that fire was stronger still. Law\nalone, without enforcement, is just breath. He flinched as part of the bank’s\nroof sagged inwards, flames spurting up, sparks whirling. Never cross\nValint and Balk, Zalev had told him the day he entered the law. Never. By\nthe Fates, if they with all their wealth and secrets and power could be\nburned, what was safe? The fire was already spreading towards the narrow\nbuilding where his own offices were located.\nHe had spent his life’s work on that firm. Built it up with his own hands.\nWell, his and Zalev’s and Crun’s, he supposed, but mostly his, since Zalev\nhad died and Crun was concentrating on patents.\nHe lurched to a halt, wheezing, groaning, bending over with hands on\nknees as the horrible music sawed on, and the whores pointed and laughed\nand drank. The injustice! He came here to help these girls. He was their\nbenefactor. Their patron. A father figure! Well, no, more a kindly uncle. He\nwas loved in this neighbourhood. And now they mocked him while he\nblundered about naked. Like a sad bear he once saw with a travelling show.\nStill, it could have been worse. It could have been him tied to the stake\nwith all that legal kindling about his ankles. He put a hand over his mouth,\ntrying to swallow his dyspepsia.\nSomeone hit him and he squealed in agony. A line of fire across his bare\nbuttocks.\n“Please!” he wheezed, holding up that desperate hand. “Please!”"

Who’d stop him? “What a day!”\nAnd he lashed at the lawyer again with his whip and caught him across\nthe thighs, made him stagger, fall on his knees, the fat bastard.

Some king, some big man. “Not so big\nnow!” He smashed a bit of the inscription away. He’d no idea what it said.\nThere’d be no need for letters after the Great Change.\n“Give me some o’ that!” Ripping a bottle from Framer’s hand while he\nwas in the middle of trying to drink and making him spill spirits all over\nthat stupid cap of his.\n“You bastard,” said Framer, wiping his face, but Moth just laughed and\ntook another swig. He saw a little girl in a doorway, watching at him. A\nlittle brown girl with great dark eyes, tear tracks glistening on her face.\nHe shoved the bottle in the air and laughed. “What a day!”\nHessel turned away from the madness in the square. It scared her too much.\nShe shuffled back into the doorway, where her father was lying.\n“Father,” she whispered, tugging at his arm. “Please wake up!”\nHe wobbled with her shaking, but he did not wake.

In spite of the priests’ long efforts at instruction, she had never\nquite been able to tell the difference. “Oh God, oh God, oh God.”\nHe had said things would be better here. Dawah was not safe any more.\nFirst, the emperor’s soldiers had been driven out of the town, and there was\nchaos, and that had been very bad. Then the Eaters had come, to bring back\norder, and that had been far worse. She had seen one of them, in the main\nstreet, at sunset. A terrible light had shone from it. She still saw it, in her\ndreams, the black eyes, and the empty smile, and the blood on its fine robes.\nSo they had fled from Dawah. Her father had said things would be better\nhere.\n“Oh God, oh God, oh God…”\nBut things had not been better here. There was no work. People spat at\nthem in the street. They had gone from one town to another, and the little\nmoney that had not been stolen from them by the sailors on the voyage had\ngradually leaked away. They had heard there was work in Valbeck, so they\nhad banded together with a dozen other Kantics for safety on the road. It\nhad been a hard journey, only to find there was no work in Valbeck, either.\nNot for pale faces, let alone for dark. People looked at them like they were\nrats. And now everything had gone mad. She did not understand what had\nhappened. She did not even know who had hit her father, or why.\n“Oh God, oh God…”\nThe priests said if she prayed every morning and every night and was\npure within then good things would happen. She had prayed every night and\nevery morning. Had she done it wrong? Was she rotten inside, that God\nshould punish her?\n“Oh God,” she whimpered, shaking her father’s shoulder. “Please wake\nup!”\nShe did not know what to do. There was no one here she knew. They had\ntaken her father’s shoes. His shoes, God help her, his bare feet flopped out\nsideways, and she touched one of them gently with a trembling hand, tears\nin her eyes.\n“Oh God,” she whispered. What should she do?\nShe heard scraping footsteps. Someone had edged around the wall into\nthe doorway, hunched over in a ragged coat missing an arm, staring\nfearfully out into the square where figures writhed and lurched to the\nderanged music.\nHessel crouched, showing her teeth, not sure whether to fight or to cry.\nSometimes, the priests had said, one must rely on the kindness of strangers.\n“Please,” she said. It came out a desperate squeak.\nThe beggar spun about. It was a woman. A pale woman with a shaved\nhead. She looked mad. Streaks of dried blood from a scab on her scalp, dark\npaint smeared from one staring, red-rimmed eye.\n“My father… won’t wake up,” said Hessel, the unfamiliar words clumsy\nin her mouth.\n“I’m sorry.” The woman’s bloody neck shifted as she swallowed.\n“There’s nothing I can do.”\n“Please!”\n“You have to be quiet!” hissed the woman, eyes sliding terrified towards\nthe square."

Please!”\nShe started to scream it, louder and louder, she could not stop herself. She\nwas not even sure if she was saying it in the Union tongue or the Kantic.\nThe beggar pulled away, dragging Hessel after her.\n“Please! Please! Please!”\n“Shut your mouth!” shrieked the woman, and flung her against the wall,\nand Hessel heard her scramble away, out into the square.\nShe picked herself up, rubbing at the sore spot where her head had\nstruck the stone. She crawled over to her father and touched him gently on\nthe arm.\n“Father,” she begged. “Please wake up.”\nSomething of Ours\nS\navine stumbled from the alleyway. Behind her, the child was still\nwailing.\nThe music had screeched to a halt. The dancing, too. Eyes turned\ntowards her. Black eyes, glinting with flames in the darkness.\nShe saw the outline of the tall man with the tall hat, a burning torch in\none hand, his other raised to point at her.\n“Bring me that one!”\nShe fled, forcing her trembling legs to another effort, ducked down a\nside street, slid in filth, went over in the gutter and scrambled up again. She\nplunged past a staring old woman, through a court crammed between tiny\nhouses, a great heap of ash and dung and bones piled in the midst, crawling\nwith vermin.\nShouts behind her, jagged shouts and jagged laughter, slapping footfalls\nechoing off the peeling walls. She flung herself desperately at doors as she\npassed, locked, locked, locked, then one flew open and she tumbled through\nthe guts of a squalid building.\nA room with a sagging ceiling where rags were heaped, people stretched\nout sleeping. Drunk, husk-addled, half-dressed, mouths hanging heedlessly\nopen, spilling drool. The stench was indescribable. Someone had broken a\nhole in the floor and used it for a privy, flies crawling. Savine retched as she\nstaggered between the bodies, hand over her mouth, blundered through a\ndoor at the back and into an alleyway.\n“There you are.” Two men ahead of her. She reeled away, boots\nskittering on the cobbles, and found herself facing a dead end. A blank wall\nof mouldy brick, not even a door to try. She slowly turned, breath crawling\nin her throat. They closed in with the cocky swagger of men who know\nthey’ve won. One had an ugly squint and a stick with a nail through it. The\nother had a cap drawn low over a bent face.\n“Get back!” hissed Savine, holding up her hand. It might have been\nmore impressive had it not been trembling so badly.\n“It’s a woman,” said Squinty, starting to grin.\nThe one with the cap peered down his bent nose at her coat, held tight\nover her sword. “What’re you hiding?”"

Sound in command, you’re halfway to\nbeing there. It came out a quavering croak. But her accent was plain, even\nso.\nSquinty’s smile spread further. “Not just a woman. A real lady.” And he\nslapped his stick gently into his palm, fingered at that nail through it.\n“Fallen on hard times?”\n“Lot of ladies have, today,” said the one with the cap, easing forwards.\nSavine shuffled back in a crouch, eyes darting between them. “I’m\nwarning you—”\nSquinty had turned thoughtful. “Might be it’s her.”\n“Her? Who her?”\n“Savine dan—”\n“Shut your mouth!” she shrieked. Her eyes went wide. She realised she\nhad run him neatly through the chest with her sword. A textbook lunge\nBremer dan Gorst could have been proud of.\n“Fuck,” said the one with the cap, stepping back, eyes wide.\nSquinty gave a strangled cough, dropped his stick and pawed at his chest\nwhere the blade was. He tried to say something but had no breath.\nShe pulled the sword back and it sliced a deep gash through the side of\nhis hand. Blood welled, a black stain spreading down his jacket.\nThe one with the cap reeled away and Savine darted forward, slashing\nhim across the back of the thigh. She fumbled the sword and it caught him\nwith the flat, didn’t even cut through his ragged trousers, but it was enough\nto make him stumble and he sprawled in the gutter.\n“Please!” he squeaked, wriggling up onto his hands, staring over his\nshoulder, as scared as Savine had been a moment before. “Please!”\nHe gave a little whoop as the blade punched through his ribs, arched\nback, squirmed over, face twisting in agony. Savine knelt on top of him,\ntrying to drag her sword free, but it was stuck right through him and he was\nwriggling, groaning, wriggling. She heard shouting up the street. Echoing\nfootfalls.\nShe let go of her sword and ran, every muscle aching now, her lungs on\nfire. She snatched a look back. Figures in the murk, huge, distorted.\nWhoops and laughter, like huntsmen after a fox. A great shape loomed\nahead, a monster with a thousand bristling limbs, and she skittered to a halt.\nA barricade, thrown up across the street, the limbs the legs of chairs, and\ndesks, and tangled timbers. A man stood on it. A huge man with hardly any\nneck, hair clipped to stubble, features hidden but for lenses flashing orange,\nthe new kind, mounted in thin wire, tiny on his heavy, stubbled face.\n“Help me!” Holding out her bloody hand, her voice a desperate squeak.\n“I’m begging you!”\nHe folded Savine’s wrist in an irresistible grip.

For a terrible moment,\nshe wondered if she had made the worst mistake of her life.\nHe hoisted her effortlessly up beside him. She saw torch flames bobbing,\ncould hardly breathe for fear, hardly move for it. She shrank down\ntrembling behind a broken chest of drawers, clung to a chair leg.\nHer pursuers slowed as they came close. Six of them, breathing hard\nfrom their run, sticks and clubs and torches in their clenched fists, and at the\nfront the tall one swaggered forward, tall hat skewed at a rakish angle.\n“That’s far enough,” said the big man. A calm voice, very deep, very\nslow. How could he be calm? How could anyone be calm ever again?\n“Nice wall you’ve built,” said Tall Hat, sneer across a sweat-beaded,\npockmarked face, his eyes wild, wide, burning with the reflected fire of his\ntorch as he held it high.\n“Thanks,” said the big man, “but I’ll ask you to admire it from a\ndistance.” He unhooked his lenses from his ears and ever so carefully\nfolded them. “I’ll ask nicely.” He rubbed at the bridge of his nose with\nfinger and thumb. “But I’ll only ask once.”\n“Can’t.” Tall Hat gave a big grin. “You’ve got something of ours.”\nThe big man pushed his folded lenses into Savine’s limp hand and\ngently curled her fingers shut around them. He sounded almost sad.\n“Believe me, there’s naught here you want.”\n“Give her up!” barked Tall Hat, voice turned suddenly so sharp, Savine\nflinched at it.\nThe big man hopped down from the barricade and walked forward, not\nworried, not hurried. Savine could hardly understand what he was doing.\nTall Hat had his doubts, too. He raised his torch. “I’m not scared o’—”\nThe big man darted at him, caught the swinging torch on his shoulder\nand shrugged it off in a shower of sparks. His fist sank into Tall Hat’s side, a\nshort, quick blow, but Savine heard the thud of it, felt the force of it. It\nfolded Tall Hat over and left him tottering.\nThe big man took him by the coat and jerked him off his feet. Lifted him\nhigh, as if he was no more than a sack of rags, then flung him down on the\ncobbles so hard his hat bounced off.\nHe gave a shuddering groan, stretched out a quivering hand, and the big\nman calmly lifted his big boot and stomped his face into the road.\nSavine stared, hardly breathing.\nThe big man looked up at Tall Hat’s companions, brushing a few embers\nfrom his shoulder. They stood in a shocked half-circle. Five men, but none\nof them had moved the whole time.\n“We can have him,” said one, though he sounded far from certain.

He held a loaded flatbow, something drawn on the\nback of the hand on the trigger. Tattooed. “Ah, I said.” He eased towards\nthem, pointing the bow with more intent, head of the bolt gleaming. “Don’t\nyou bastards understand fucking ah?”\nIt seemed they did. They began to retreat. The one who’d worn the hat\ngave a faint gurgle. One of them dragged him up, head lolling, his face a\nmass of black blood.\n“Aye!” shouted the stringy man, lowering his flatbow as they\ndisappeared into the sweltering night. “And don’t come back!” He wiped\nhis sweaty forehead with his tattooed hand as his companion clambered\nback onto the barricade. “Damn it, Bull, this wasn’t part o’ the plan.”\nBull was an apt name for the big man. He frowned at Savine, and she\ncringed away until her back hit a wall. “Well,” he said, wincing as he\nrubbed at his knuckles, “you know what happens to plans when the fighting\nstarts.”\n“Fucking Burners!” snarled the bowman, loosening his string and\nslipping out the bolt with a practised air. “Bastards have gone mad. Just\nwant to burn everything!”\n“That’s why they call ’em Burners, Sarlby.” There was a woman there,\ntoo. A girl with a tough, bony face, squatting down beside Savine, all\nbusiness.\n“She hurt?” asked Broad.\n“I think just scared, mostly.” Savine felt her hand prised open, and the\ngirl took the lenses out and offered them up. “Who could blame her for\nthat?” Savine realised who she was. The Vallimirs’ maid. What had been her\nname? Dinner on the hill felt like a thousand years ago. May. May Broad.\nShe put gentle fingertips on Savine’s cheek. “What’s your name?” She\ndidn’t recognise her. No surprise. Savine barely recognised herself.\n“Ardee,” she whispered. Her mother’s name was the first she could think\nof, and she felt a burning pain building at the back of her nose, and gave a\ngreat snotty sob, and started to cry. She couldn’t remember the last time she\ncried. She wasn’t sure she ever had. “Thank you,” she blubbered. “Thank\nyou—”\nThe girl was frowning down at her chest and Savine realised her foul\ncoat had fallen open. Ruined though it was, one of the bones poking from\ntorn silk, there was no mistaking the quality of her corset. Only a fool could\ndoubt this belonged to a very rich lady, with servants to get her into it. And\none look in this girl’s sharp eyes told Savine she was no fool.\nShe opened her mouth. To blurt some story. Puke some lie. But all that\ncame out was a stuttering croak. She had nothing left.\nMay’s eyes moved up from that ruined embroidery that had been a\nmonth of some poor woman’s labour. Then she calmly pulled the coat\nclosed over it."

The very flag under which Casamir the Steadfast had conquered\nAngland, now held perfectly straight in Corporal Tunny’s gnarled fist,\nmartial prowess distilled into a square of cloth.\nThere was a rousing rattle of arms and armour as the men spun towards\nOrso, stomped down their left heels and saluted in perfect unison. Five\nhundred soldiers, moving as one, sun glinting from their freshly forged\nequipment. A mere tenth part of his newly raised expeditionary force, fully\nprepared to sail north and give Stour Nightfall a resounding kick up the\narse.\nOrso probably shouldn’t have said it himself, but it was quite a stirring\nspectacle.\nHe returned their salute with a flourish he had been perfecting in front of\nthe mirror. He had to admit he liked wearing a uniform. It gave him the\nnovel feeling of being a man of action. Furthermore, as well cut and\nstarched as this one was, no casual observer could have suspected his\npaunch had been on the increase lately.\nColonel Forest grinned as he looked the soldiers over. That open, honest\ngrin that seemed to represent the very best of the Union common man.\nEarthy, dependable, loyal. A stout yeoman if ever there was one, with his\nstocky build, and his pronounced facial scar, and his lustrous grey\nmoustaches, and his campaign-worn fur hat.\n“As fine a body of fighting men as I ever saw, Your Highness,” he said.\n“And I’ve seen a few.”\nThey had chosen to call themselves the Crown Prince’s Division. Well,\nOrso had let them choose the name and Forest had no doubt suggested it. Or\nmore likely insisted on it. Even so, Orso was hugely pleased by the\ncompliment. Perhaps because, for once, he felt he had done the slightest\nsomething towards deserving it.\n“What d’you think, Hildi?” he asked.\n“Very shiny,” she said. With characteristic enterprise, she had wangled\nan embroidered drummer-boy’s uniform to go with her battered cap and\nnow looked quite the soldier. Why not? She had, after all, no less military\nexperience than Orso.\n“What d’you think, Gorst?” he asked.\n“A fine body of men, Your Highness.” Orso had to stop himself wincing.\nHowever often one heard that piping voice, one never quite got comfortable\nwith it. “You are to be congratulated.”\n“Nonsense. All I did was stand here.” And spend Savine’s money, and\nsmile, and develop a top-quality salute, anyway. “You’re the one who did"

All I did was stand here.” And spend Savine’s money, and\nsmile, and develop a top-quality salute, anyway. “You’re the one who did\nthe work, Colonel Forest!”\n“Colonel bloody Forest,” muttered Tunny, shaking his head as if at\nunbearable affectations, while Yolk, always keen to follow his leader, gave\na sneer to match.\nForest ignored them. At ignoring Tunny, as at so many things, he\nappeared steeped in experience. “They’ve all served before, Your Highness.\nSome fought in the North. Most fought in Styria. All I did was remind ’em\nhow to go about the business, and that’s no more than my job.”\n“Men can do their jobs badly but you’ve done yours bloody well. I’m\nlucky to have you.” And Orso gave Forest the special smile. The one he\nreserved for moments of actual happiness.\nThe two of them had formed a winning partnership, so far. Forest\nprovided the experience, judgement, warmth, discipline, courage, facial\nscarring and, of course, superb moustache. Orso supplied the sparkle, the…\nWell, his facial hair had always been wretched and he had no noticeable\nscars, so honestly the sparkle was about all. Perhaps that was what the\nhistorians would call him. The King of Sparkle. He gave a helpless snort of\nlaughter. People could have called him worse, he supposed. Indeed, they\noften had.\n“A king’s job is not to do things well.” Orso gave the slightest wince at\nthe Styrian words, pronounced at ostentatious volume among hundreds of\nmen who had been fighting Styrians for the last ten years—and losing. He\nhad forgotten his mother had come to observe. She sat in her folding chair\nin the shade of a portable purple awning, her ladies arranged about her on\nthe grass like the gilt frame to a masterpiece. “It is to pick the people who\nwill do them well on his behalf.”\n“You sound almost impressed, Mother,” said Orso, switching to Styrian\nhimself, but at least doing it quietly. “I hadn’t realised your voice could\nactually take that tone.”\n“Nonsense, Orso. You have heard me be impressed with other people on\noccasion.”\nHe sighed. “True enough.”\n“And it is hardly as though you have done anything you could expect to\nimpress me since you went over to solid food.”\nHe sighed again, more deeply. “Also true enough.”\n“A future king has no business fighting.”\n“All the greats were warriors, no? Harod, Casamir, Arnault—”\nThe queen waved the weighty names away. “No doubt the common folk\nswoon over a conquering king, but it’s the coupling kings who found the\ndynasties.”\n“I’ve spent years coupling. That’s never impressed you, either.”\n“It’s who you couple with, Orso, as you very well know. I’d much rather\nyou were getting married.” She sat back, giving him a thorough\nexamination, tapping at the arm of her folding chair with one exquisitely\nmanicured fingernail. “But if you must play soldiers in the meantime, I will\nadmit…” And she allowed the corner of her mouth to bend by an\ninfinitesimal fraction. “I am impressed.”"

The glow of satisfaction that warmed him to the roots of\nhis hair revealed that for one of his many lies. “I suppose everyone grows\nup sooner or later,” he said, turning away so she would not see him blush.\nThe queen stood, her folding chair instantly whisked away by one of her\nliveried footmen. “Perhaps you could help your father do it.” And she\nturned back towards the palace, her ladies-in-waiting forming a glittering\nspearhead of which she was the diamond point.\n“Her Majesty looked almost… pleased,” muttered Tunny, lowering the\nSteadfast Standard and rolling the royal heirloom up with superb skill. Say\nwhat you like about the man, and people often did, but he knew his way\naround a flag. “And I’ve a feeling that’s not easily done.”\nOrso raised his brows. “She’d rather I was getting married, apparently.”\n“You could marry Colonel Forest,” said Tunny. “I definitely sense love\nblooming between you two.”\n“A man could do a lot worse. Forest is experienced, organised,\ndependable, considerably more intelligent than me yet defers to me anyway.\nAside from a quim, he has every quality one could ask for in a bride.”\nTunny glanced over at Forest, face reddening beneath that fine fur hat as\nhe bellowed orders at the men. “That bloody hat of his looks like a quim.”\nOrso choked back a laugh. It actually did, a little. “Watch your mouth,\nCorporal. I may be forced to promote you.”\n“Anything but that.” Tunny had been offered the role of sergeant major\nbut flatly refused to consider anything above corporal. Some men are like\nwater. No matter how high they are lifted, they always yearn to return to the\nappropriate level. He squinted up at the blazing sun. “Hope you’ve packed\nsome warm clothes, Your Highness. Hard to imagine now, but it gets bitter\nup there in the North.”\n“It’s what the place is known for, after all.”\nA knight herald was striding over, past the footmen busily dismantling\nthe queen’s awning. “Your Highness!” he thundered at entirely unnecessary\nvolume, snapping his armoured heels together. “His Majesty wishes to see\nyou at once!”\n“At the palace?”\n“At the House of Questions, in the company of Arch Lector Glokta.”\nOrso winced. “Can’t they see I have an army to lead to glory?” He\nthought about that for a moment. “Or to watch Colonel Forest lead to\nglory?”\nTunny leaned in to mutter, “You’ve made glory wait twenty years.\nDaresay another hour won’t make the difference.”\n“At last!” snapped the king as Orso stepped through the door, plainly very\nfar from his usual good-humoured self.\nHis Eminence sat behind his desk in his wheeled chair, a blanket over\nhis knees in spite of the heat, looking even more grim, gaunt and pale than\nusual, which took some doing.

Orso had once seen a three-day-old plague\ncorpse with better colour to its cheeks. Standing at Glokta’s shoulder was\nperhaps the one man in the entire Union more hideous than he: his deputy,\nSuperior Pike, whose entire face was obliterated by monstrous burns. Pike’s\nexpression was hard to read, but overall the mood was far from\nencouraging.\nAs was his long-established habit, Orso began with deflection. “I’ve got\nquite the busy day, Father. If you want to see me off, you—”\n“You’re not going to the North,” growled the king.\n“I’m… what?” Orso was robbed of the chance to move on to evasion\nand forced straight to entitled upset. “Father, I worked for this—”\n“Other men work for things all the time! What makes you special?”\nI’m the crown prince of the bloody Union! was on the very tip of Orso’s\ntongue, but luckily Pike spoke first, his soft voice betraying no more\nemotion than his burned face.\n“Your Highness, there has been an uprising in Valbeck.”\nOrso swallowed. “Uprising?” The word was a decidedly ugly one to use\nbefore someone of royal blood. Could Pike not have gone for something a\nbit more neutral, like incident? Even riot would have been preferable. Then\nhe realised the fact that the Superior was using it, in front of a king, a crown\nprince and their Arch Lector, might be a good guide to the severity of the\nsituation.\n“It is coordinated, well organised and on a considerable scale. It would\nappear the workers at several mills rose up simultaneously, overpowering\nforemen, guards and owners.”\n“They’re in control of these mills?”\nThe Arch Lector’s left eye began to twitch and he dabbed away a tear.\n“It would appear that they are in control of the whole city. They may well\nhave infiltrated the town watch, too. Perhaps… even the Inquisition.”\n“They have thrown up barricades,” said Pike, “taken hostages and are\nissuing demands.”\n“Good grief.” Orso sank numbly into a chair. Valbeck had grown to be\none of Midderland’s largest and most modern cities. Uprising was\nbeginning to sound like a euphemism. This was a short step from outright\nrevolt! “How could this happen?”\n“A damn good question!” snapped the king, frowning towards his Arch\nLector.\n“The Breakers are at the heart of it,” said Glokta. “And the Burners.”\n“Who the hell are they?” asked Orso.\nA muscle was working angrily on the side of His Majesty’s head. “The\nBreakers want to force concessions from me. The Burners want to see me\nand the entire nobility and government of the Union hanged so they can\nimpose a new order, probably one on fire.”\nOrso swallowed again. It felt as if there was a lump in his throat he\ncould not force down. “I take it their opinion of me is less than glowing?”\n“You think your mother’s a harsh critic? Wait until you hear what these\nbastards say about you.”\n“I have an agent in Valbeck,” said Glokta. “She sent a boy back to Adua"

We simply\nhave no idea of the situation inside the city.”\n“Chaos,” growled Orso’s father, clenching his fists.\n“The success of these traitors will encourage other malcontents,” said\nGlokta. “Other plots against His Majesty and His Majesty’s subjects. We\nare stretched to the limit keeping the peace. Prince Orso, yours are the only\ntroops available.”\n“I will accompany you to Valbeck, Your Highness,” said Pike, “to\nprovide the full support of the Inquisition.”\nOrso blinked. “But what about the North? I was—”\n“For pity’s sake!” the king burst out with uncharacteristic violence,\nripping open the top button of his braid-heavy jacket and dashing sweat\nangrily from his forehead. “Not everything is about you! The Arch Lector’s\nown daughter is caught up in this!” He seemed to remember himself,\ncleared his throat self-consciously. “And many others, of course. Many sons\nand daughters—”\n“Wait, what?” Orso struggled to supress a surge of utter horror. “Your\ndaughter… Savine?” Though he knew full well the Arch Lector had no\nothers. That lump in his throat had swelled so much he could scarcely speak\naround it.\nGlokta sagged into his chair. “She was in Valbeck. Visiting one of her\nmanufactories.” His grey lips peeled back from his ruined teeth. “I have not\nheard from her. I do not know if she is free, or a prisoner. I do not know if\nshe is alive, or—”\n“Damn these treacherous bastards!” burst out the king, grinding one fist\ninto his palm. “I’ve more than half a mind to lead the Knights of the Body\nout there myself!”\n“It would be beneath the king’s dignity.” Orso stood, the legs of his chair\nshrieking across the tiles. “I’ll go.” Savine needed him. “I’ll go at once.”\nAnd the rest of the Union, of course, but, bloody hell, Savine needed him!\n“Tunny!” he roared, striding for the door. Almost a shriek, in truth. “Tell\nColonel Forest we march for Valbeck immediately!”\nUgly Business\nS\nhe lay on her side, her cheek on his shoulder and both legs wrapped\naround one of his, pressed against him, huddled against him, bur rowed into\nthe blankets beside him.\nLeo was always so warm, like having one of those lovely glowing\nwinter logs from the old firepit in bed with her. Not long ago, she’d spent\nweeks bitter cold, not to mention hungry, chafed and terrified, so lying\nwarm and safe, nicely balanced between sleeping and waking, was\ncontentment to feel awfully thankful for in Rikke’s mind. Would’ve been\nperfect, really.\nIf he could’ve just kept his mouth shut.\n“She won’t let me do a bloody thing,” he was grumbling. “She treats me\nlike… a puppy on a short leash!”\n“Lion on a leash,” she mumbled."

No such luck.\n“We need to get to grips with them.” An uncomfortable jolt went\nthrough his shoulder as he clenched his fists. “Need to hurt the bastards!”\n“Isn’t that the point?” Rikke reluctantly opened one eye and lifted her\nhead to peer at him through it. “Scale and Calder and Stour between ’em\nhave more men than us. So we slow them down. Keep them split up. Keep\nthem guessing. Every mile we draw them on, they get weaker.” It was\nsomewhat troubling that she, who’d never drawn a sword, was having to\nexplain to him, a famous warrior, how their strategy worked. “We wait for\nour moment. Your moment.” She let her head drop back onto his shoulder\nand wriggled into his warmth again. “Wait for your friend Prince Orso to\narrive—”\nHe jerked up, dumping her head onto the mattress and bringing her fully\nand unpleasantly awake.\n“Oh, yes,” he sneered, “the Prince of Drunkards will totter to our\nrescue.”\n“Well, not on his own.” Rikke tried to pick the sleep out of her eyes.\n“My father says he’s bringing five thousand men with him.”\n“Five thousand whores, maybe. They say that’s how many he’s bedded.”\n“How old is he? Twenty-five?” Rikke screwed her face up as she went\nover the sums. “If he really got going at seventeen, that’s eight years of\nfucking so… what… a couple every day? Provided none of ’em tempt him\nback for seconds. And he never has a day off. I mean, we all have moments\nwhen we’re not in the mood. Has he got ’em queueing down the palace\ncorridors?” She gave a snort of laughter. “His cock must be sore.”\n“Perhaps it’s only four thousand,” said Leo, sourly.\n“More likely his reputation’s run way ahead of the truth.” Rikke raised\none brow at Leo. “I hear that can happen with some young men.”\n“Perhaps Crown Prince Orso’s the exception. Maybe he’ll fuck the\nNorthmen to death for us.”\n“Fine by me, if it gets the bastards to go home.”\nShe tried to ease him back down beside her but he wouldn’t be moved.\n“It’d hardly be a surprise, since he’s got a Styrian degenerate for a mother.”\n“A Styrian what?”\nLeo’s lip curled like it might’ve at a dead dog in bed with them. “The\nrumour is she lies with women.”\nRikke had never been able to understand why you’d care a shit who"

How few problems do you need to\nhave before you count that among ’em? “Would’ve thought you’d\nunderstand. You spend most o’ your time with men.”\n“What does that mean?”\n“Well… tight-knit group, your friends, aren’t they?”\nLeo frowned, not quite getting all her point yet. “We’ve known each\nother for years. I grew up with Jurand and Antaup. And I met Jin in Uffrith,\nyou know that. We’re brothers-in-arms.”\n“And such strong arms, too!” And she squeezed one of his. “No wonder\nyou all enjoy a wrestle.”\n“It’s good exercise, and…” His eyes went wide and he twisted away\nfrom her. “That’s disgusting!”\n“Not to me.” He’d some towering opinions, all right, but rarely built on\nmuch. She quite liked digging at their foundations and watching ’em totter.\n“Can’t think of anything more wholesome than all those muscular male\nbodies, glistening with sweat, grunting and straining and slithering around\ntogether—”\n“Do you have to drag everything into the gutter?”\n“I don’t have to.” She caught his shoulder and pulled him back beside\nher. “But it is warm down here.” She tried to nuzzle up against him but he\nwas already on to his next grievance.\n“I don’t blame Orso, really.” As if that was doing the man quite a favour.\n“Stealing other men’s glory is what princes are for.” As if this was all about\nwho got the glory, not who got home alive. “It’s my bloody mother I blame,\nfor letting him get away with it!” He’d have blamed his mother for letting\nthe rain fall. “Why can’t she just trust me?”\n“Ugh,” said Rikke, rolling away to stare up at the flapping tent cloth. It\nwas plain her favourite part of the day was fully ruined. She’d no notion\nwhy he was so keen to rush into a battle he’d most likely lose. The boy had\nmany fine features—bravery, honesty, good humour, a fine-shaped face and\nan even better-shaped arse, and so constantly, reliably warm. But\nimagination was not a strong point. Nor was he labouring under a low\nopinion of himself. Maybe losing was not a thing he could conceive of.\nMaybe to him, every delay was just wrong-headed shits throwing\nthemselves in the way of his certain triumph.\n“… let me off the leash, I’d show these bastards something…”\nThe memory floated up, as it did at least once a day, of hiding under that\nriverbank while Stour Nightfall laughed about what he’d do to her. She\nthought of Uffrith in flames, and all the good folk hurt or killed, and she\nclenched her fists at the usual rush of fury. No one wanted that bastard dead\nmore than she did, but even she saw they had to be patient.

Say one thing for Leo, he might get sulky, but he cheered up\nquick. He pushed the blankets back and wriggled next to her, his hand\nsliding across her chest, and down her stomach, and around her backside,\nand onto the inside of her thigh, and giving her quite the pleasurable shiver.\n“What does get a girl wet?” he whispered in her ear.\n“For me, it’s pretty boys with too much courage and too little\npatience…” Seemed the morning might not be a total loss after all. She\npushed her fingers into his hair and dragged his face down towards hers,\nstraining up to kiss him, his breath a touch fierce with the overnight smell,\nbut—\n“Leo!” came a call from outside.\n“Ah, shit,” she hissed, head dropping back.\n“There’s a knight herald in the camp!” Jurand’s voice, sharp with\nexcitement.\n“Bloody hell!” Leo squirmed free of Rikke despite her attempts to wrap\nher legs around him, jumped out of bed and started dragging his trousers on.\n“Might be the Closed Council!” Grinning over his shoulder as if that was\njust the news she’d been waiting for. “Making me lord governor!”\n“Grand,” grunted Rikke, upending her boot and shaking it till the chagga\npellet fell out, then wedging it behind her lip.\nThere was quite the mood of expectation outside, half-dressed men\nshuffling between the tents, still chewing their breakfasts, breath smoking\nas they asked for news and got no answers. Everyone was drifting one way,\nlike leaves on a current, towards a pair of gleaming wings bobbing up\nahead. The helmet of a knight herald, striding through the rain-sodden camp\ntowards the forge Lady Finree had borrowed for her headquarters.\nLeo hurried after him, pulling on his cloak, while Rikke hopped along\nbehind with Jurand, one of her socks already full of mud.\n“Is your message for me?” asked Leo. “For Lord Brock?”\nMaybe not everything was about him after all. The knight herald strode\non up the muddy hillside without even a sideways glance, a satchel over his\nshoulder stamped with the golden sun of the Union.\n“Might be Prince Orso’s arrived with his men,” said Rikke hopefully,\ntrying to get her other boot on and follow both at once.\n“I wouldn’t count on it.” Jurand didn’t look at her, a jaw muscle working\non the side of his face.\n“You don’t like me much, do you?”\nHe glanced across, surprised. “Actually, I do.” And he offered her his\nelbow so she could stop hopping. “You’re hard not to like.”\n“I am, aren’t I?” she said, finally dragging her boot on.\n“I’m just… protective.” He frowned towards Leo as they set off again,"

Rikke\nbarged Jurand with her shoulder so he lurched into the guard’s arms. While\nthey were busy getting disentangled, she sidestepped, slipped around them\nand was in.\nShe’d never been in a council of war before but, like fucks and funerals,\nher first time was something of a let-down.\nThe forge was stuffed with people, warm and damp from their nervous\nbreath. Leo’s mother had her gloved fists planted on a table spread with\nmaps, a litter of anxious officers clustered about her. Lords Mustred and\nClensher were among ’em, two dour old noblemen of Angland who’d\nbrought some reinforcements in the day before. Rikke wasn’t sure which\nwas which, but one had a thick grey moustache, the other whiskers all\naround his jaw but his top lip shaved. Like they only had one whole beard\nbetween ’em.\nRikke’s father was scratching uneasily at his own silvery stubble, his\nWar Chiefs around him. Hardbread looked concerned, as usual. Red Hat\nlooked grim, as usual. Oxel had his usual shifty sideways squint like the\nknight herald was another man’s sheep he was thinking of making off with.\nAnd Shivers just looked like Shivers, which was probably the most\ntroubling of the lot.\nIn fact, the least worried man in the forge was the smith who owned it,\nwho simply looked angry to have been stopped working so a bunch of fools\ncould argue under his steadily leaking roof. But that’s war for you. An ugly\nbusiness that only leaves bad men better off. Why folk insisted on singing\nabout great warriors all the time, Rikke couldn’t have said. Why not sing\nabout really good fishermen, or bakers, or roofers, or some other folk who\nactually left the world a better place, rather than heaping up corpses and\nsetting fire to things? Was that behaviour to encourage?\n“World’s full o’ mysteries, all right,” she muttered to herself, and shifted\nher chagga pellet from one side of her mouth to the other.\n“My Lady Governor!” boomed out the knight herald, painfully loud in\nthat little space, bowing low and nearly poking Shivers’ good eye out with\none of the wings on his helmet. “A communication from His August\nMajesty!” And he whipped that satchel open, produced a scroll and\nshouldered through the damp press to hand it over with a showman’s\nflourish.\nSilence, then, as Finree dan Brock broke the great red seal and began to\nread, stony face giving nothing away.

Or maybe Mustred.\n“He has not.” The lady governor’s jaw worked as she looked up. “Nor\nwill he.” She passed the letter to Leo, noticed for the first time that his shirt\nwas hanging out, undone, then frowned over at Rikke, whose shirt was\nhanging out, too, all the buttons in the wrong holes.\nRikke looked down at the ground, chewing hard at her chagga and her\nface on fire. Lady Finree often spoke about forging stronger connections\nbetween the Union and the North but she doubted Rikke fucking her son\nwas quite what she’d had in mind.\n“There has been a serious uprising in Valbeck,” grated out Leo’s mother.\n“The Breakers have seized the city.

Now he was a\nmountain of blubber, pale jowls spread over his fur collar, a tuft of grey hair\nsprouting from his sweat-beaded pate, his beard full of grease and his\nswollen cheeks full of broken veins. Two painfully skinny girls haunted his\nelbows with a platter and a jug and the hardest jobs in the North—making\nsure their king never ran out of ale.\nA set of old warriors were gathered at his right side with well-polished\narmour but long-faded names. Scale would’ve called them his closest\nNamed Men, his royal retinue, his king’s bodyguard. But their main\npurpose was to remind him of old victories, and insist he was still the man\nhe’d been when he had half the belly and twice the hands, in spite of all the\nevidence.\nThe firepit was banked high, the tables crammed with warriors, the\nstolen hall sweaty as a forge and noisy as a battle, women kicking and\ncursing as they shoved through the press with platters of meat. Clover sat\nwith Wonderful at Black Calder’s table, in the shadows further from the\nfirepit. There was less gold over here, and less laughter, and less ale, but a\nlot more power. Scale Ironhand might wear the king’s chain, but everyone\nwho mattered knew it was his brother who made the king’s choices.\nCalder had an odd guest today, though. A small man in travel-worn\nclothes who carried no weapon but a staff he’d left leaning against the wall.\nAs strange a thing in this hall bristling with blades as a hen playing among\nfoxes. Clover had seen Black Calder entertain some strange, proud, grand\nguests. Styrians, and Union men, and dark-skinned Southerners drawn into\nhis spider’s web of schemes. But he never saw him treat anyone with as\nmuch respect as this nothing-looking little unarmed man.\n“He’ll be along, Master Sulfur,” said Calder, laying a humble hand on\nthe tabletop between them. “You can depend on it.”\n“You have never given me cause to doubt,” said Sulfur. “Yet.” And he\ngave that hand a familiar pat.\nCalder swallowed and drew his hand back. “A shame your master\ncouldn’t be here.”\n“Oh, indeed.” Sulfur smiled about at the grease-smeared, ale-spattered\ngathering. “He does love sophisticated conversation. But, sadly, he is\ndetained in the West.”\n“Nothing serious, I hope?”\n“A disagreement with two other members of our order. His brother\nZacharus and his sister Cawneil have… their own ways of seeing things.”\n“Families, eh?” grunted Calder, frowning at his brother. “Our best\nfriends and our worst enemies.” And there was a clatter as the doors were\nheaved open.\nStour Nightfall swaggered in with chin hefted high and sword slung low,\noozing so much scorn it was a wonder he didn’t tramp through the firepit"

The warriors at his back swept the benches\nwith fighters’ contempt as the hall fell silent. Magweer aimed a baleful glare\nat Clover, and Clover saluted him with a piece of half-eaten meat.\n“You come late?” rumbled Scale, sucking the last shreds from a bone\nand tossing it down for his dogs to fight over. “To dine with your king?”\nThe old king and his old cunts glowered at the young heir and his young\ncunts, naught praiseworthy on either side but all jealous of what the others\nhad even so. Matching groups, in many ways; Clover could almost see each\nwarrior squaring up to his counterpart. The mean one, the handsome one,\nthe one who hardly spoke, the one who spoke too much.\n“Like looking in a mirror,” he muttered.\n“A mirror that makes you old,” said Wonderful.\n“I come whenever it fucking pleases me.” Stour hoisted his sneer up\nfrom the king’s impressive collection of stripped bones to the king’s fat\nface. “After all… my guess was… you’d be dining…a while.”\nThe chill moment stretched a little longer, then Scale broke out in a roar\nof wheezy laughter and struggled with an effort to his feet, almost upending\nthe table as he caught it with his mighty belly. “Tell me of your victories,\nNephew!” And he spread his arms wide, iron hand dangling limp from the\nend of the withered right one.\nStour gave that wolf grin as he danced around the table. “None to sing of\nlately, Uncle,” and he flung his arms around the king, and they clapped each\nother on the back with a great show of manly affection. “This Union bitch\nand this Dogman coward are still fighting over who can run away from me\nfastest.”\n“Ha! Keep pushing ’em, boy, keep pushing ’em! Don’t give those\nbastards a chance to breathe!” Scale jabbed weakly with his iron hand as if\nit was an army, while he drained his cup with the other and held it out for\nmore.\n“He should get himself a bigger cup,” murmured Clover.\n“Maybe two,” said Wonderful. “He could empty one while his servants\nfilled the other. The poor girls would never have to stop pouring.”\nThe Great Wolf was still bemoaning the lack of murder. “At this rate,\nthey’ll fall back beyond the Whiteflow and we’ll win without ever drawing\nour swords.”\nScale clapped Stour on the shoulder so hard he nearly knocked him over\nthe table. “You’re like a fighting dog, can’t wait to slip the leash! So was I,\nonce. So was I.” And the King of the Northmen stared off into the firepit,\neyes shining with reflected fire, and drained his cup again, and held it out\nagain, and made the girl shrug back her long braid and dart forward with the\njug. Again.\nClover took a sip from his own cup. “Don’t ever let me drift along on\npast glories, Wonderful.”\nShe gave a grunt. “You’d have to have some glories to do that.”"

He was one of those men couldn’t say anything quietly. “By\nthe dead, I wish I could’ve been there!” And he knocked his iron hand\nagainst the table with a clonk. “Where’s that girl? Fill a cup for my heir!”\nStour sat back and flung one boot up on the table. “Well, Uncle, when I\ncrossed the Crinna with a thousand Carls, I knew we were far\noutnumbered…”\nWonderful rubbed at her temples. “Must’ve heard this story ten times the\nlast ten weeks.”\n“Aye,” said Clover, “and every telling makes Stour a bigger hero. Soon\nhe’ll be beating a thousand barbarians with his hands behind his back and\nhis sword tied to his cock.”\n“Warriors.” Sulfur gave a heavy sigh, as if at a spell of bad weather. “It\nseems the Great Wolf is in no mood to discuss the future of the North\ntonight.”\n“No, Master Sulfur!” If it had been any other man, Clover would’ve\ncalled the note in Black Calder’s voice a wheedle. “Like all storms, he’ll\nsoon blow himself out.”\n“Alas, I have so much other business.” Sulfur’s eyes shifted to Clover\nfor a moment. Different-coloured eyes, he noticed, as they glittered in the\ntorchlight. “Never the slightest peace, eh, Master Steepfield?”\n“I reckon not,” muttered Clover, no idea who this bastard was or how he\nknew his old name, but judging it always wise to agree with a dangerous\nman. And any man Black Calder feared was a dangerous man, whether he\nwore a sword or not. “They call me Clover these days, though.”\n“Calling a wolf a cow will not make him give milk. The same could be\nsaid of calling chaos order.” Sulfur put aside his cup and stood, looking\ndown at Calder. “My master appreciates that we must sometimes have a\nlittle chaos if a better order is to emerge. There can be no progress without\npain, no creation without destruction. That is why he has indulged this little\nwar of yours.” He looked up as Scale roared with laughter at some new\nflourish of Stour’s, and the warriors about them competed with each other\nto blast the spittiest peels of merriment. “My master loves to see the earth\nploughed, from time to time.”\nCalder nodded. “That’s all I’m trying to do.”\n“Provided the soil settles quickly and a new seed is sown. Otherwise\nhow can he reap a harvest?”\n“Tell him this war will be done soon,” said Calder, “and the harvest\nricher than ever. We’ll win. He’ll win.”\n“Whoever wins, he wins. You know that. But too much chaos is bad for\neveryone’s business.” Sulfur plucked his staff from the wall. “It is often the\ndoom of men blessed with greatness that they are cursed with short\nmemories.

The one outside Osrung.” And Sulfur smiled as he turned away.\nA toothy little bright-eyed smile, but it seemed to Clover there was\nsomehow a threat in it.\nHe leaned close to Wonderful. “Everyone serves someone, I reckon.”\n“Looks that way,” she said as she watched Sulfur slip from the hall.\n“And they’re usually a prick.”\nThe moment he was gone, Calder thumped furiously at the table. “By\nthe fucking dead!” He glared over at his son, still boasting to his king’s\ngreat delight. “He’s worse than ever and my brother only encourages him!\nDidn’t I tell you to keep him on the right path?”\nClover helplessly spread his hands. “There’s only so much even the best\nshepherd can do with a wilful ram, Chief.”\n“At this rate, he’ll end up as mutton! What did Stolicus say? Never fear\nyour enemy, but always respect him? This Brock woman’s for damn sure no\nfool and the Dogman’s for damn sure no coward.”\n“Reckon they’re just waiting for their moment.” Clover sighed. “Sooner\nor later, they’ll be setting a trap for us.”\n“And at this rate, these two heroes will be blundering right into it.”\nCalder frowned harder than ever at his son. “How did he end up with so\nlittle of me in him?”\n“Never had to face hard times,” said Wonderful, softly.\nClover wagged a finger at her. “There speaks the stern voice of\nexperience. Defeats do men far more good than victories.” And he reached\nup and scratched gently at his scar. “Best gift I was ever given. Taught me\nhumility.”\n“Humility,” scoffed Calder. “Can’t think of a man with a higher opinion\nof himself than you.”\nClover raised his cup to Magweer, who’d picked him out for another\ndose of glaring as Stour’s manly legend reached its climax. “The world’s\nbrimming with folk keen to break me down. Don’t see any reason to do\ntheir work for ’em.”\n“You don’t see any reason to do any work at all.”\nThere was no point denying it. Luckily for Clover, the King of the\nNorthmen chose that moment to struggle up, raising his iron hand for\nsilence.\n“Here comes the wisdom,” murmured Black Calder, without much\nrelish.\n“My father, Bethod!” Scale roared at the gathering, swaying from good\nale and bad knees. “Made himself King of the Northmen! He built cities,\nand bound them with roads. He forced the clans together, and carved out a\nnation where there was none before.” No mention of the thirty years of\nbloodshed that had got it done. But that’s the nice thing about looking\nbackwards. You can pick out the bits that suit your story and toss the\nunhappy truths to the wind.\nScale was frowning down into the firepit now. “My father was betrayed.\nMy father was struck down! His kingdom torn up like meat between greedy\ndogs.” His dewy eyes rolled up, and he pointed to Stour with his good hand."

Stour\nNightfall, my nephew and my heir, will rule supreme from the Whiteflow to\nthe Crinna and beyond!” And he held up his cup, ale slopping over the rim\nand spattering down his front. “Bethod’s dream lives on in his grandson!\nThe Great Wolf!”\nAnd all raised their drinks and competed with each other to roar out\nStour’s name the loudest, and Clover and Wonderful raised theirs just as\nhigh as anyone else.\n“Still say he’s a prick,” whispered Clover, smiling wide.\n“More so with each day,” forced Wonderful through clenched teeth, and\nthey tapped their cups together and took a swallow, because Clover had\nnever worried much over what he drank to, as long as he drank.\nCalder didn’t join the toast. Just frowned at his brother as he sagged\nback down on his bench and bellowed for more ale. “Some men never\nlearn,” he murmured.\n“We all learn.” Clover watched those old warriors and those young, and\never so gently scratched at his scar. “Just some of us have to learn hard.”\nA Deal\n“Y\nou promised me, Gunnar.” Liddy’s voice came muffled through the\nflimsy wall, but easily understood. “You promised me you’d stay out of\ntrouble.”\n“I’ve tried, Liddy. I haven’t looked for it, it’s just… it’s found us out.”\n“Trouble has a habit of finding you out.”\nSavine looked across the little room at May, light from outside the ill-\nfitting window catching her clenched jaw, head turned away from her\nparents’ voices as if to pretend she could not hear them.\n“I’m just trying to get from one day to the next,” came Gunnar’s voice.\n“Trying to keep things together.”\nKeeping things together was no easy task in Valbeck. The riots might\nmostly have stopped but the heat, and the anger, and the fear hung over the\ncity thick as the vapours had when the furnaces were still lit. Fear of\nviolence. Fear of hunger. Fear of what would happen when the authorities\nreturned. Fear that they might not. Who was in charge depended on who\nyou asked, which part of town you were in, whether it was day or night. If\nthere was any plan in all this madness, all this destruction, Savine could not\nsee it. No one was safe in Valbeck now. Perhaps no one ever truly was.\nPerhaps safety was a lie people told themselves so they could carry on.\nShe closed her eyes, and thought of the feeling as she stabbed that\nsquinting man through the chest. As she ran the one with the cap through\nthe back. A slight pressure in her palm. A slight tugging at the grip of the\nsword. So shockingly easy, to kill a man.

Stand on the barricades. Hand some food out. I’m not a soldier no\nmore. I’m not a herder no more. What should I be?”\n“My husband. May’s father.”\n“I know. That’s all that matters, but… what should I do?” It was strange\nto hear that wheedling, almost tearful note in the voice of a man Savine\nknew to be so very dangerous. “I can’t just sit and do nothing, can I, while\npeople are getting hurt?”\nThere was no weakness in Liddy’s voice. Her strength amazed Savine,\nthe way she kept going, working, smiling, making the best of this\nnightmare. “It’s a fine line, Gunnar, between helping people and hurting\n’em. You’re prone to wander all over it.”\n“I’m trying to do the right thing, it’s just… the right thing ain’t always\neasy to know.” And their voices dropped to a soft burble, lost as someone\nstarted shouting outside. A fight, maybe. Savine shrank back until it drifted\noff down the street and was gone.\nShe licked her lips as the silence pressed in on her. She did not want to\nspeak. But it was better than seeing those faces again. “My parents used to\nargue, sometimes.”\nMay’s eyes met hers. “What about?”\n“My father’s work. My mother’s drinking. Me. I was always their\nfavourite argument.” Were they arguing about her even now? Savine looked\ndown at the cheap boards, full of splits and splinters. It was better not to\nthink about her old life. Better to pretend to be a new person, who belonged\nwhere she was. Who knew she was lucky to be here.\nLiddy had given her a dress, if you could call it that. A shapeless bag of\ncoarse cloth, carefully mended and smelling of cheap soap, and she was\ngrateful for it. Gunnar had found her a mattress, or some scratchy sacking\nthat the straw poked through. Savine had no doubt it swarmed with lice, and\nshe was grateful for it. She shared a room with May no bigger than a\ncupboard in her house in Adua, with laths showing through the cracked\nplaster and a bloom of mould about the flaking window frame. She scarcely\never had a moment to herself, but she was grateful for that, too. When she\nwas alone, the things she had seen and done the day of the uprising rushed\ninto her mind, like filthy water into a holed boat, and dragged her down so\nquickly she felt she was drowning.\nShe had thought of trying to get out of the city, but the truth was she\nscarcely had the courage to look out of the window, let alone to risk the\nstreets again. She found she had a great deal less courage altogether than\nshe had smugly supposed while blackmailing investors, or choosing a wig,"

She found she had a great deal less courage altogether than\nshe had smugly supposed while blackmailing investors, or choosing a wig,\nor pronouncing social death sentences in the salons of Adua. She had\nalways reckoned herself such a gambler. No more audacious woman in the\nUnion. Now she realised the games had always been rigged in her favour.\nShe never had to gamble with her life before, and the stakes had risen\nsuddenly far too high for her taste.\nThey had a candle the first few nights but now it was gone, and the only\nlight came from distant fires, always burning somewhere in the city.\nEverything was running out. The shops had been looted, the rich houses\nstripped back to the rafters. The Breakers brought some food around, but\nevery day there was less.\nShe had always known life was hard in these slums, but if she had\nthought about it at all, she had pictured a romantic version. A version that\nwas easy to live with. Pretty children, giggling as they frolicked in the\ngutters. Old women cackling as they boiled bones in a pot. Strapping men\nslapping one another on the back, singing good old work songs in harmony\nas they sat around a fire made from their last sticks of furniture. Oh, the\nsisterhood, the spirit, the nobility of poverty!\nIt turned out there was nothing romantic about shitting in a bucket while\nsomeone else watched. Nothing spirited about hoarding the bones from the\nchicken for tomorrow’s dinner. Nothing sisterly about the women who tore\nat each other over scraps scavenged on the great rubbish heaps. Nothing\nnoble in the cramps you got from rotten water at the pump, or the lice you\npicked from your armpits, or being endlessly cold, endlessly hungry,\nendlessly scared.\nAnd yet living this way did not make Savine sorry for the people who\nwere forced to do it every day. Who did it in the many buildings just like\nthis one she profited from all across the Union. It only made her desperate\nnever to live this way herself again. Perhaps that made her selfish. Wicked.\nEvil, even. While she fled whimpering through the city on the day of the\nuprising, she had sworn to a God she did not believe in that she would be\ngood, if it meant she could live.\nNow she was happy to be evil, if it meant she could be clean.\n“You were in Colonel Vallimir’s house,” said May. Savine stared at her,\ncaught off balance and failing to hide it, the constant nagging ache of fear\nturned suddenly, terribly sharp.\n“What?” she croaked.\n“The night before the uprising.” May could not have looked calmer. “I\nserved you jelly.”\nSavine’s eyes slunk to the door. But there was no way out of this room\nwithout going through the other. Where a man she had seen stomp another\nman’s head into the road was arguing with his wife. “Horrible jelly,” she\nmuttered.\n“I was trying to work out how much your dress cost,” said May. Far\nmore than this room. Probably more than this whole building. “Your hair\nwas different.” She glanced up at the mousy fuzz starting to grow back on\nSavine’s scalp. “A wig?”"

The way she used to in a meeting with\npartners. A negotiation with rivals.\nMay nodded slowly. As if she guessed Savine’s thoughts. “Beautiful\ndresses. Horrible jellies. Different world, isn’t it? You asked me what I\nthought about the city.”\n“You were… very honest.”\n“Little too honest for my own good, I expect. Always been a problem of\nmine. You stood up for me, though. I listened at the keyhole, and you stood\nup for me.”\nSavine cleared her throat. “Is that why you took me in?”\n“Wish I could say yes.” May sat forward, thin hands dangling over her\nknees. “But that wouldn’t be entirely honest. Fact is, Vallimir’s whole house\nwas buzzing with news of your visit. Everyone desperate to get a look at\nyou. I know who you are, my lady.”\nSavine twitched. “You don’t have to call me that.”\n“What should I call you? Savine?”\nSavine flinched. “Best for both of us if you don’t call me that, either.”\nMay lowered her voice to a whisper. “Lady Glokta, then?”\nSavine grimaced. “Best not to even think the name.” There was a long\nsilence while they looked at each other. Next door, someone had started\nsinging. Always happy songs, because there was misery enough here\nwithout singing up more. “Might I ask… whether you’re thinking of telling\nanyone?”\nMay sat back. “My father thinks you’re just some waif got lost. My\nmother guesses you’re somebody, but she’d never guess who. Best we keep\nit that way. If news got out…” She left that hanging. It was nicely judged.\nThere really was no need to say more. Savine remembered the crowd of\nmen in her mill, all looking at her. The mob. The hate in their faces.\nShe carefully licked her lips. “I would… appreciate your discretion. It\nwould put me…very much in your debt.”\n“Oh, I’m counting on it.”\nSavine turned up the hem of her dress, heartbeat thud, thud, thudding in\nher ears, and dug down inside the fraying seam with a finger, hooking out\nthe earrings she had been wearing the day of the uprising. First one, then\nthe other, the unfamiliar gleam of gold in the shadows.\n“Take these.” Her voice was far too eager for a negotiator of her\nexperience. “They’re gold with—”\n“Don’t think they’d go with my ensemble.” May’s eyes flicked down to\nher own threadbare dress, then back up to Savine. “You keep ’em.”\nSilence stretched out. Clearly May had planned this. Waited for her\nmoment and already set her price.\n“What is it you want?” asked Savine."

Trying to judge whether she could be trusted.\nJust as Savine would have, in her worn-out shoes. “Can you do that?”\nA refreshing change, to go into a negotiation holding none of the cards.\n“I think that is the very least I could do,” said Savine.\nMay spat in her palm and offered it out. The room was so small, she\nbarely had to lean forward. “Deal, then?”\n“Deal.”\nAnd they shook.\nThe New Monument\n“D\no you know how many peasant labourers died building King\nCasamir’s roads?” asked Risinau.\nHe shaded his eyes against the angry sun to look up at the monument\nthat dominated Casamir’s Square. Or its remains, anyway. All that was left\non the eight-stride-high pedestal, cobwebbed with wobbly scaffolding, were\na pair of enormous boots sheared off at the calf. Aropella’s famous statue of\nthe legendary king himself, who’d defeated the Northmen and added\nAngland to the Union, lay in scarred chunks on the cobbles, daubed with\nmessy slogans. A gleeful urchin was trying to prise His Majesty’s nose off\nwith a crowbar.\nVick only broke a silence when she knew she could improve on it.\nRisinau was the sort of man who’d soon answer his own questions.\n“Thousands! Buried in the loam of Midderland in unmarked pits beside\nthe roadways. And yet Casamir is remembered as a hero. A great king. And\nall those marvellous roads. What a gift to posterity.” Risinau gave a snort of\ncontempt. “How often have I walked through this square and gazed up at\nthis paean to a tyrant, this symbol of oppression?”\n“No doubt it’s a stain on the Union’s past.” Risinau turned somewhat\nreluctantly to Malmer, who stood behind them with Gunnar Broad looming\nat his shoulder. “But it’s the present that’s worrying me.”\nMost of the Breakers still had the fervour of true believers, or at least\npretended to, but Broad pushed his lenses up and frowned at the ruined\nmonument as if he was harbouring some doubts. What happened when the\nrest began to doubt was anyone’s guess. Risinau didn’t seem worried,\nthough. He was fixed on higher things.\n“And only look at what we have achieved today, brothers!” He clapped\nMalmer and Broad on their shoulders as if he’d fold them in a great hug.\n“We have cast Casamir down! In his place we shall raise a new monument\nto the workers who died for his vainglory!”"

In his place we shall raise a new monument\nto the workers who died for his vainglory!”\nVick wondered how many workers would be dying for Risinau’s\nvainglory. No small number was her guess. Casting down a king two\ncenturies dead was one thing. The one currently on the throne might raise\nstiffer objections. She was starting to think the ex-Superior was at least\nhalf-mad. But then sanity was a rare commodity in Valbeck lately, and\ndidn’t look to be coming back into fashion any time soon.\nPracticals were always loitering around Risinau like the dogs around the\ncity’s baking rubbish. They’d put aside the black and taken off the masks,\nbut a sharp eye could still pick out the telltale tan marks around the mouth.\nThey were swarming in the streets near the House of Questions,\noptimistically renamed the House of Liberty, hunting for anyone disloyal.\nOr perhaps for anyone loyal. Loyalty had become quite the fluid concept.\nThe uprising had changed some things, but others seemed wearily\nfamiliar. The workers were still working, the Practicals were still watching,\nthe big hats might have moved around, but the men wearing them were still\nlecturing everyone else on the way things should be while doing none of the\nwork themselves.\nSome Great Change.\n“Ever since its founding by that charlatan Bayaz, the Union was always\nbuilt on the backs of the common folk,” Risinau was spouting. “The coming\nof the machines, the ever-swelling avarice of investors, the raising up of\nmoney as our god and the banks its temples, these are only the latest,\nbleakest appendices to our sorry history. We must dig new theoretical\nfoundations for the nation, my friends!”\nMalmer made another effort at hauling him down to earth. “Honestly,\nI’m more worried over feeding folk. One of the big granaries got burned\nthat first day. Another’s empty. And this heat’s not helping. Few o’ the\npumps in the old town are already running dry. The water from some of the\nothers I wouldn’t give to a dog—”\n“The mind needs nourishment, too, brother.” Risinau waved away a fly,\nthe only things prospering in the stifling city, then grinned at Vick. “No\ndoubt Sibalt told you that.”\nIf Sibalt had told her that, she’d likely have broken his nose. It was the\nsort of shit only someone who’s never starved could serve up.\n“He was a fine man.” Risinau struck his fist against his heart. “I miss\nhim as one might miss a part of oneself. I think… that must be why I so\nenjoy conversing with you, sister. It is as close as I can come, now, to\ntalking to him.”\nVick rarely allowed herself the luxury of not liking people. No more\noften than the luxury of liking them. Either one could get you killed. But\nshe was starting to truly despise Risinau.

She could see no way this fat dreamer could have\norganised this uprising alone. Someone a great deal more formidable had\ndone the heavy lifting. And Vick wanted very much to know who. So she\nnodded along to his nonsense as though she’d never heard such profound\nrevelations.\n“I arrested him for organising here,” said Risinau, gazing into the\ndistance. “Twenty years ago, just after I joined the Inquisition, and the\nfoundations of the first mills were being laid in Valbeck. We both were\nyoung men, then. Idealistic men. I arrested him, but in the end, I could only\nagree with him. That the workers would be ground down.” Risinau gave a\nheavy sigh, the plump hand on his plump gut rising and falling with his\nbreath. “I released him. To be my informant, I thought. I told myself that I\nhad turned him, but the truth was… he turned me. We turned each other,\nmaybe. Just the two of us, talking late into the night about the blows we\nwould strike for the common man! Just the two of us… and the Weaver.”\nVick frowned. “Aren’t you the Weaver?”\n“A title I borrowed from a better man,” mused Risinau, before his fickle\nattention was snatched away. “We should draw up a manifesto, don’t you\nthink? Demand a workers’ representative on the Closed Council!” He had\nthat gleam in his eye again, as though he was gazing off towards a better\ntomorrow. “Sibalt would have loved that idea…”\n“Look, brother.” Malmer made one more desperate effort at waking the\ndreamer, stepping in close, making Risinau’s Practicals bristle. “I knew\nSibalt, too, and he was a good man, but he’s dead. There’s lots of good\nliving folk in need. People are hungry, people are sick, people are scared.”\nHe dropped his voice. “I’ll be honest, I’m bloody scared.”\n“You don’t have to be! No one does. We’ve stopped the riots, haven’t\nwe?”\n“In daylight. But there have been beatings. Hangings, even. And not just\nowners. Foreigners. Servants. Folk are taking the chance to settle scores. To\njust grab whatever they want. We need order.”\n“And we will have it, brother! Some of the workers have been so long\noppressed they were sure to be carried away with their new freedom. But\nour prisoners are safe in the House of Questions—of Liberty, I should say,\nthe House of Liberty. The mayor, the commander of the city watch, various\nleading citizens, by which I mean the most greedy and debased—”\n“What about Savine dan Glokta?” asked Malmer. “I heard she was in the\ncity.”\n“She was.” Risinau gave a shudder of distaste. “A most acid, arrogant\nand impolite young woman. The exploitative avarice of the modern age,\npersonified. Scarcely to be preferred to her father as a dining companion.”\n“It’s not her manners that interest me, it’s what she could buy us.”"

Scarcely to be preferred to her father as a dining companion.”\n“It’s not her manners that interest me, it’s what she could buy us.”\n“It would appear she slipped through our fingers. The day of the uprising\nwas rather chaotic, as I say, even more so than expected…”\nBroad gave Malmer a worried glance over his lenses. “Let’s hope Judge\ndoesn’t have her.”\nVick felt a surge of worry even above the usual. “Why would Judge\nhave her?”\n“The Burners took charge of a big chunk of the old town,” said Broad.\n“We had to put barricades up. They aren’t too picky over who they hurt.”\n“We’ve no notion what’s going on over there,” said Malmer, “but\nthey’ve taken hostages. I hear Judge set herself up in the Courthouse—”\n“Where else would Judge take up residence?” Risinau gave a little titter,\nbut no one joined him.\n“She says she’s going to start trying her prisoners for crimes against the\npeople.”\nVick felt the horror creeping up her throat. “How many does she have?”\n“Two hundred?” Malmer gave a hopeless shrug. “Three? Some owners,\nsome rich folk, but plenty of poor folk, too. Collaborators, she’s calling\n’em. Anyone ain’t zealous enough for her taste. And her taste is for the very\nzealous.”\n“We have to get those prisoners,” said Vick. “If we’re ever going to\nnegotiate—”\n“Judge has never been the most reasonable.” Risinau shrugged as though\nall this was a natural disaster in which he was entirely helpless. “Since the\nuprising, she has turned positively caustic.”\n“Don’t the Burners answer to you?”\n“Well… they’re unpredictable people. Fiery. That’s why they call them\nBurners, I suppose!” He snorted up another a little titter, then, when he saw\nVick had never looked less like laughing, cleared his throat and went on. “I\nsuppose I could ask for her prisoners…”\n“Or you could send me to ask,” she said, catching his eye and holding it.\n“That’s what Sibalt would’ve done. We need you to work on what really\nmatters. Our manifesto. Our principles. Let me talk to Judge.”\nRisinau liked that. His little eyes twinkled at the thought of paragraphs\nof neat script. Of high-minded declarations. Of rights and freedoms. “Sister,\nI begin to see why Sibalt thought so highly of you. Take some men along.”\n“Definitely.” From what she’d seen of Judge, Vick thought she’d better\ntake a lot of men and those ready for violence. As luck had it, her first pick\nwas close by.\n“Brother Gunnar?” She glanced down at the tattoo on Broad’s fist. “I’ve\na feeling you could find a few men who know how to fight.”\nHe frowned at her over his lenses. “Made a promise to my wife I\nwouldn’t take any risks.”\n“The bigger risk is if we don’t do it. If the Arch Lector’s only daughter\ngets hurt, His Eminence won’t rest until every one of us is dangling.” She\nlooked over at Risinau, explaining to his unmasked Practicals how he\nwanted his new monument to look, living in a dream that was apt to become"

There were houses burned out, their windows yawning empty, the\nfire-blackened brickwork of a fallen chimney stack left in pieces across the\nsun-baked mud of the roadway. Rubble and glass were scattered, torn\nclothes and broken furniture flung around as if a great wind had ripped\nthrough the neighbourhood. The place stank, worse the further they went.\nStank of rot and piss and charred wood and stale smoke, all cooking in the\nsticky heat.\nSarlby held his flatbow tight, hard eyes flicking between the doorways.\n“Weren’t many rich folk around here before the uprising.”\n“Weren’t any,” said Broad.\n“Got robbed and burned out anyway.”\n“Poor folk never feel comfortable around the rich. Given the choice,\nthey’d much rather rob other poor folk.”\nVick turned to hiss over her shoulder. “Keep up. Keep together.”\n“Can’t say I care much for taking orders from a woman,” grumbled\nSarlby, though he took ’em anyway.\n“This one seems to know what she’s doing,” said Broad. “More’n I can\nsay for most of the officers in Styria.”\n“You’ve a point there.”\n“Looking back at the last five years, truth is I make shit decisions. These\ndays I tend to do what the women tell me and assume it’s for the best. Liddy\nsays build a barricade, I build one. May says take in the girl came over it, I\ntake her in.”\n“The one with the clipped head? She’s living with you?”\n“Ardee’s her name, and she can’t do a damn thing. Liddy asked her to\nhelp cook and she looked at the pot like she never saw one before.” Broad\npuffed out his cheeks. “But May’s taken a liking to her, so she stays.”\n“Hard times, I guess,” said Sarlby. “Everyone’s got to do what they\ncan.”\n“Hard times,” echoed Broad. “When do they get softer? That’s the\nquestion.”\nAll felt far too quiet. He saw a figure lurking in an alleyway, a face at a\nwindow quickly vanished, a couple fighting over a bone who scurried away\nas they came close. Someone had been busy with a paintbrush, there were\nslogans smeared and spattered everywhere. Painted across whole terraces in\nletters three strides high. Scrawled across front doors in letters tiny as in a\nbook.\n“What do they say?” asked Sarlby.\nBroad pushed his lenses up his sweaty nose and squinted so he could\nspell them out. “Fuck the king. Fuck the queen. Fuck them all. Rise up.\nTake what’s yours. That type o’ thing.”\n“Might steal your clothes,” muttered Sarlby, shaking his head, “but\nthey’ll leave you with a fine slogan. Fucking Burners. Just another kind of\narsehole.”\n“That’s politics for you,” grunted Broad. “Arseholes digging up excuses"

Just another kind of\narsehole.”\n“That’s politics for you,” grunted Broad. “Arseholes digging up excuses\nto be arseholes.”\n“High ideals and reality are like oil and water,” muttered Vick. “They\ndon’t mix well.” She squatted at a corner, beckoning them over. “Quiet\nnow. We’re here.”\nValbeck’s Courthouse had been a grand building, stately steps of\ncoloured marble with stately columns at the top. Someone had been on the\nroof and torn some copper from the dome, a spider’s web of rafters showing\non one side. The big new bank next door must’ve been even grander than\nthe Courthouse not long ago. Now it was just a burned-out shell. Ashes\nchased each other around Broad’s boots in little swirls as they crossed the\nempty square in front.\n“Someone tried to hold ’em off here,” he said as they eased up the steps.\nThe doors were battered, one half-torn from its hinges and hanging loose.\n“Let’s hope we do better,” said Sarlby, fingering his bow.\nA pair of statues flanked the entrance. Impossibly stately ladies in noble\nposes no person ever struck, one holding a book and a sword and the other a\nbroken chain. Justice and freedom, Broad reckoned. The Burners had\nsmashed Freedom’s head off and put a dead cow’s where it used to be, flies\ncrawling at the glassy eyes, dried blood in streaks down the hacked marble.\nJustice had a great red smile daubed over her frown, and We’ll give you\nfucking justice painted in drippy letters across her chest.\nVick strode between them. “Some sense of humour, these Burners.”\n“Oh, aye,” said Broad. “They’re a hoot.”\nThe door of the great courtroom wasn’t guarded, but the public benches\nwere scattered with Burners. Or perhaps they were just thieves, pimps,\ngamblers and drunks. Hard to tell the difference. Some hooted and jeered,\nshook their fists. Others were passed-out, surrounded by empty bottles. A\ncouple had made a nest from some old curtains and the slurping sound of\ntheir hungry kissing echoed about the chamber. A dark-skinned Kantic was\nhuffing so hard on a husk-pipe, Broad wondered if he was trying to replace\nthe Valbeck vapours single-handed. Flies buzzed in the soupy heat and the\nplace stank of unwashed bodies. Someone had daubed a childish cock\nacross the mosaic floor in red paint, but rain had come through the hole in\nthe dome and washed half of it into a rusty puddle.\nJudge sat up on high in the judge’s box, the lunatic ringleader of this\ncarnival of fools, a judge’s four-cornered black hat perched on her riot of\nred hair. She’d wreathed herself in stolen jewels: fingers crusted with rings\nand one arm dripping with bracelets, guildsmen’s chains and strings of\npearls and ladies’ necklaces in a tawdry tangle across her battered\nbreastplate.

The sight of that leg gave Broad a guilty tickle, deep inside.\nThe same one he got when he felt violence coming.\nThe dock held a bony old prisoner, hands tied behind his back, wispy\nhair stiffened with blood, chin covered with white stubble. The two guards\nby him wore clown’s motley but the swords they carried were no joke.\n“Ricter dan Vallimir!” sneered Judge. “Quite apart from anything else,\nyou stand accused of having a fucking ‘dan’ in your name—”\n“Guilty!” There were ten whores in the jury box, eight women and two\nboys, plus a thickset man in an apron who looked decidedly puzzled to be\nthere. One of the whores had leaped up, night bell tinkling around her neck,\npainted face twisted in a mad snarl. “Shitting guilty!”\n“Ladies of the jury!” Judge whacked at her desk for order with a hatchet,\nsending splinters flying. “How many times? Fucking silence till I’m done\nwith the charges!”\n“I reject this court,” growled Vallimir, puffing up his chest. “I denounce\nit!” Someone on the public benches flung rotten fruit at him. It missed, burst\nagainst the far wall, spraying slime across the fine old panelling. “You scum\nhave no authority over me!”\n“Wrong!” shrieked Judge. “Show him our credentials!”\nOne of the men in motley clubbed Vallimir across the head and knocked\nhim gasping against the rail. The other dragged him up again, blood from a\nfresh cut streaking his face.\nJudge shook her ring-covered fist at him. “We have the authority of the\nfist! We have the authority of sharpened metal! We have the authority of\nforce, you blubbing cunt, which is the only real authority there is.” Some\nlight cheering from the few members of the audience still conscious. “You\nshould know that. You were a soldier. Counsel for the defence? Where’s\nthat fucker Randock?”\nA man rose trembling from behind a table covered with ash, empty\nbottles and a flyblown chicken carcass. He was stripped naked apart from a\npair of broken lenses clinging to his broken nose, hands clasped defensively\naround his fruits, his back a mass of purple bruises. “No defence, your\nhonour,” he gabbled out, “what defence could there be?” And he gave a\nhysterical little titter and shrank back into his broken chair which rocked on\nthree legs and nearly dumped him on the floor, much to the amusement of\nthe jury.\nJudge wasn’t laughing. She’d caught sight of Vick and her Breakers as\nthey filtered through the door and spread out around the public benches. Her\nblack eyes seemed to linger on Broad and made that guilty tickle spread all\nover him. He told himself she was lethal as a scorpion, but that didn’t help.\nJust the opposite.\n“I don’t remember calling witnesses,” she said, lip curling. “I might\nhave to find you lot in contempt.”\n“That’s one word for it,” said Vick, glancing around. “Risinau sent us.\nHe wants your prisoners.”"

Seeing folk drink always\nmade Broad thirsty, but there was something about the way she wrapped her\ntongue around the glass neck made him especially want to be in her place.\nOr maybe it was the bottle’s place he wanted.\nJudge narrowed her eyes at Vick. “If Risinau wants a favour, he\nshould’ve come himself.”\n“He sent me.”\n“Should I be scared?” The Burners were waking up to the new arrivals\nnow, staring blearily over, hands creeping towards weapons.\nVick didn’t step forward, didn’t step back. “Not if you give me the\nprisoners.”\n“My prisoners have charges to answer, sister, but don’t worry!” Judge\nwaved towards the jury. “They deliberate like lightning, these bitches.\nSometimes I have to stop ’em giving the verdict before I’ve even named the\naccused! If they were in charge in Adua, we’d soon have the case backlog\ncleared and every lawyer out of work.”\n“They’d be selling their arses in the gutter!” squealed one of the whores,\nto gales of laughter from her fellow jury members, and the naked lawyer\nflinched, and looked down at his feet.\nJudge leaned forward, smile turning to a snarl. “We didn’t throw down\nour masters just to raise up another! Far as I can see, Risinau’s setting\nhimself up like an owner above his workers, like a king above his subjects,\nlike—”\n“A judge above her jury?” offered Vick.\n“Ouch!” Judge pushed out her lips in a pantomime of upset. “Cut with\nmy own razor, you cunning fucker.” She leaned from her box to shriek at\nthe tiny clerk’s desk below, where a bent old beggar-woman was sitting.\n“Strike that from the record!”\n“Can’t write anyway,” muttered the beggar, and went back to drawing\nscribbles in the ledgers.\n“I get it.” Vick stepped forward. “You want to see someone pay. No\ndoubt there’s plenty to pay for.” Broad didn’t know how she could stay so\ncool with all this sweltering madness around her. “No one wants to see\nthem pay more than me. But we’ve a city full of people to think about. We\nneed something to bargain with.”\nIt was a good effort. Very calm. Very reasonable. But Broad didn’t\nreckon this was the place for calm or reason. Strip it all back, it’s the\nauthority of the fist that counts. Judge was right about that, and Broad knew\nit better than anyone. Beside him, Sarlby eased the dowel from the trigger\nof his flatbow.\nJudge slowly stood, clenched fists on her scarred desk, bony shoulders\nhunched around her neck, stolen chains swinging. “Oh, I see. You’re going\nto march my prisoners up to our oppressors and swap ’em for a better\nworld.

She was trouble made flesh. Everything he’d sworn\nhe was done with. Felt he was breaking his word just looking at her. And he\ncouldn’t take his eyes off her.\n“Please,” she spat. “You can’t buy freedom.” And she snatched up her\nhatchet and hacked at the desktop, making everyone jump. “You have to cut\nit out of them! You have to burn the bastards, then dig through their ashes\nfor it! Look at you sorry fuckers. A crowd o’ cowards, playing at change.\nSomeone get these fools out o’ my sight.”\n“Your honour!” One of the motley clowns stepped towards Vick. “She\nsays out you go, so—” He was cut off in a squawk as Broad caught him by\nthe neck and flung him across the room. He crashed into the witness box,\nstaving in the panelling with the side of his head and going down in a tangle\nof limbs and splinters, his sword clattering away across the floor.\nOne of those long, silent moments, then. Broad heard some hard breaths\nbehind, the scrape as men stood, the rattle as Sarlby brought his bow to his\nshoulder, the soft ring of steel as weapons were drawn. Broad unhooked the\nlenses from his ears, folded them, slid them into his coat pocket. Ready to\nlet go. Always ready.\n“Ooooooooh.” Judge’s throaty voice had gone all purry-soft, and even\nthough she was just a sparkly blur now, Broad knew she was staring straight\nat him. “You I like. You’ve got a devil in you. Takes one to know one, eh?”\nFelt like Broad stood at a precipice, and all it would take was a nudge to\ntip him over. His voice seemed to come from a long way off. Hardly\nsounded like his at all. “I don’t want to hurt no one—”\n“’Course you fucking do! It’s written all over you. ’Cause you’re not\nmuch at anything else, are you? But at hurting people you’re the best! Don’t\napologise for it! Don’t snuff your candle, bad man, let it burn! You belong\nwith us. You belong with me. Don’t want to hurt anyone?” She clicked her\ntongue. “Your mouth says you don’t but your fists say you do.”\nThen Broad felt a hand on his shoulder. Gentle. But firm. “We just want\nthe prisoners.” Vick’s voice. Solid as a wall. “Then no one gets hurt.”\nThat wonderful, awful moment stretched out just a little longer. Then\nJudge slumped back into her seat, stuck out her tongue and blew a long fart.\n“You’re one o’ those stubborn bitches, aren’t you? Once you’ve latched\nyour teeth into something, no amount o’ beating will get you off. You know\nwhy they call me Judge?”\n“Can’t say I do,” said Vick.\n“Used to settle the disputes among the whores, down on the docks in\nKeln. Judge who had the right of it. Judge what was fair.

All seeking a better world? A world where we’re all equal?”\n“That’s right,” said Vick, her hand still on Broad’s prickling shoulder.\n“All equal.”\n“Even if our methods are different, meaning mine might fucking work\nand yours most assuredly fucking won’t.” Judge gave a generous wave of\nher hand, ring-covered fingers twirling. “Take the prisoners. But if you\nthink you’re getting anything for ’em from Old Sticks, I reckon you’ll learn\na bitter lesson. Warden of the court?”\nA man stepped forward and planted his gilded halberd on the tiles with a\nbang, smiling hugely, stark naked apart from a filthy sock over his fruits.\n“Your fucking honour?”\n“Conduct these worthies to the yard where the majority of our prisoners\nare taking their ease. And mind your foul mouth, you rogue, you, our guests\nhave delicate sensibilities.” She waved Vallimir away. “Take him down and\ngive him into the custody of the Breakers, the lucky fucker. The fucky\nlucker. Ha! Case dismissed.”\nNo more violence today, then. Broad wasn’t sure whether it was relief or\ndisappointment he felt as he fumbled his lenses back on to see Judge\npointing down at him, lips split in a mad smile. “As for you, you beautiful\nbastard, you get tired o’ pretending, my arms are always open.” She\nwhipped her hat off and tossed it spinning at the Kantic smoker. “Don’t hog\nthat pipe, you shit! Stoke it up and give me a suck.”\nBroad stood staring at her a moment longer, pulse still thudding in his\nskull, then let Vick steer him after the warden’s hairy buttocks and out of\nthe courtroom. The jeers of the jury followed him but they were half-\nhearted. It seemed, for now, the Burners had drunk their fill of justice.\nHe thought he could hear the creaking of rigging as he followed Vick\ndown the shadowy steps behind the courtroom. The sound he’d heard when\nhe looked up at the billowing sails on the voyage to Styria. But there was no\nreason for that much wood and rope behind a courthouse.\n“Bloody hell,” whispered Sarlby as they stepped out into the light.\nAcross the cobbled yard, between the broken windows to either side, the\nBurners had set up a dozen great beams, stolen from some half-built mill,\nmaybe. From those beams, at neat intervals, bodies hung. Might’ve been a\nhundred. Might’ve been more. Swaying just a little with the breeze. There\nwere men and women. There were young and old.\nAll equal now, all right.\n“Bloody hell,” whispered Sarlby again.\nNone of the other Breakers said a word. Vick stood staring. Broad stood\nstaring. High ideals, like the ones that’d led him to Styria. They surely can\ntake you to some dark places."

From the top there was a fine view of the valley\nbelow the ruined holdfast, the road threading along its bottom and the high\nfell on the far side, crowned by red bracken. Off to the west, the road met a\nfast-flowing stream and crossed it by an ancient-looking bridge. There\nmust’ve been a village beyond, the houses out of sight but the smoke from\ntheir chimneys faintly smudging the sky.\nCries drifted over as the wind picked up. Thousands of men, hundreds of\nhorses, dozens of wagons trickling down the road between the two hills and\nover the bridge in a glittering ribbon. The army of Angland pulling back\nsteadily to the south and west. Just as it had been for weeks.\n“Mustred and Clensher brought two thousand men from Angland. We\nwon’t get any more.” Leo stepped up next to his mother, planting his fists\non the crumbling parapet. “Hold off now… we’ll look like cowards.”\nHis mother gave a dry little laugh. “The one advantage of being a\nwoman in command of an army is that you don’t have to worry about\nlooking cowardly. Everyone expects it.”\n“We’ll bloody be cowards!”\nThe Dogman snorted. “Your mother was a prisoner of Black Dow, and\nfaced him down, and didn’t only talk her own way free but saved sixty men\nbesides. I’ll hear her given no lessons in courage, boy. There’s a world o’\ndifference between being scared to fight and waiting till you can win.”\n“As long as you stop waiting!” Leo waved off in a direction he hoped\nwas south-west, past the bridge towards Angland. The direction the Union\nmen were retreating. Always retreating. “We’re no more than eighty miles\nfrom the border, and if we’re pushed all the way to the Whiteflow we’ll\nnever push back. The Protectorate will be finished.”\nHe might’ve hoped for some support from the Dogman. His bloody\nProtectorate, wasn’t it? And he’d stood beside the Bloody-Nine, the greatest\nchampion the world ever saw, who won eleven duels and claimed the crown\nof the North in the Circle!\nBut the old Northman only frowned into the valley, and thoughtfully\nrubbed at his pointed jaw, and quietly said, “Well, you have to be realistic.\nNaught lasts for ever.”\n“I understand the stakes,” said Leo’s mother, turning from the road to\nfrown at the dark woods to the north, fussing absently at that bald patch she\nhad under her hair. You could see the footprint of the fortress on the hilltop\nbelow them, the walls little more than heaps of rubble, loose stones"

You could see the footprint of the fortress on the hilltop\nbelow them, the walls little more than heaps of rubble, loose stones\nscattered down the hillside, the forest pressing in at the base. “If you think\nall we do is run away, our enemies might, too.”\nCreases spread around the corners of the Dogman’s eyes as he grinned.\n“You’re going to fight ’em here.”\n“You approve?”\n“Ground’s good.” He considered the steep-sided trough of a valley with\nits grey thread of a river, its brown thread of a road, the rocky hills to either\nside. “Could be very good, if luck’s with us.”\n“You’re going to fight them here?” asked Leo, eyes wide.\n“This is a war, isn’t it? Stour Nightfall has moved ahead of his father\nand his uncle. Perhaps as much as a day ahead. His men are scattered, tired,\nundersupplied and exposed.”\nThe Dogman grinned. “Touch reckless of him.”\n“A mistake I hope we can make fatal.”\n“If we put a fat enough worm on the hook.”\n“You know how warriors are about their flags.” Leo’s mother turned to\nlook at him. “Your standard should be the very bait he needs. Especially\nafter you stung his pride by stealing one of his. We’ll make it look as\nthough our rearguard is caught in a tangle on the bridge. Hopefully, it’ll be a\ntemptation he can’t resist.”\n“You want me here in the ruin?” asked the Dogman.\n“Hidden and waiting for my signal. Angland’s forces will be\nconcentrated behind that hill to the south. Once Nightfall is committed, we\nfall upon him from both sides and catch him against the river. If we manage\nit well, we might destroy him in one throw.”\n“That’d do a lot to even the odds.”\n“And make me feel a great deal better about all this retreating. Believe it\nor not, Leo, I enjoy it no more than you do.”\nLeo couldn’t stop the smile spreading across his face. “We’re going to\nfight them here.”\n“The day after tomorrow, I hope. Do either of you have an opinion on\nthe plan?”\nLeo was too busy imagining the victory. The two hills would be the jaws\nof their trap. The Great Wolf, lured into the valley between them by his own\narrogance, surrounded at the bridge and crushed against the water. What a\nsong that would make! He was already wondering what they’d call the\nbattle, when the history books were written.\n“I like it,” said the Dogman. “If there’s one thing you can rely on, it’s\nyoung men’s folly. I’ll send word for Uffrith’s warriors to gather here and\nbe ready for a battle.” He paused, wind stirring the grey hair about his\ncraggy face. “Lady Finree… I’ve fought beside great warriors. Great War\nChiefs. Against some, too. But I rarely saw an army better handled than by\nyou. Might be men who think there’s something weak in what you’ve done,\nthe last few weeks.” He curled his tongue and spat over the battlements.\n“Those men know less’n nothing about war. Would’ve been easy to break\nfaith with us. Let us be swallowed up. But you kept your word. Aren’t many"

Aren’t many\nwho do, once they see it’ll cost them.” And he held out his hand.\nLeo’s mother blinked, evidently moved, and took it. “I’ll have kept my\nword when you are back in your garden in Uffrith, not a moment before.”\nHe broke out a great toothy grin. “Then we’ll drink to our victory there.”\nAnd the Dogman turned and trotted down the crumbling stair with a new\nspring in his step.\nIt gave Leo a flush of pride, to see the respect the old Northman had for\nhis mother. The respect they had for each other. He took a breath of sharp\nair through his nose and let it sigh happily out. “I’ll lead those men at the\nbridge—”\n“No,” said his mother. “I want your standard there to draw him on. But\nnot you.”\n“The first wave of reinforcements, then—”\n“No.” And she gave him that look down her nose that always made him\nfeel like he was still a little boy. “We’ll keep our cavalry in reserve in the\nvillage of Sudlendal.” She nodded towards the faint smoke rising beyond\nthe bridge. “I want you with them.”\n“With the reserves?” He waved a hand towards the valley. Towards the\nglory. Towards the songs. “Finally we fight and you leave me with the\nbaggage?”\n“It’s not as if I’m sending you back to Ostenhorm.” The muscles at her\ntemple squirmed as she clenched her jaw. “If something goes wrong, as it\nvery well might, you can ride in and save the day. That’s why we’re all\nhere, isn’t it? To bear witness to your legend?”\n“That’s so unfair!” he whined, the niggling thought that it might be\nentirely fair making him even angrier. “When you’re fighting for your life,\nyou don’t leave your best sword on the mantelpiece and charge in with a\nbread knife!”\n“There are other men in this army who can fight.” She spoke with icy\ncalm, but there was an angry colour spreading across her face.\n“Experienced men who understand the value of caution, and planning, and\nof doing as they’re bloody told. You’re reckless, Leo. I can’t risk it.”\n“No!” he snarled, thumping the crumbling battlements with his fist and\nsending stones clattering down the wall. “I’ll be lord governor soon! I’m\nnot a boy any more—”\n“Then fucking act like it!” she snarled, with such violence he shrank\nback a little. “This isn’t a negotiation! You’ll stay with the reserves, and\nthat’s the end of it! Your father’s dead! He’s dead, and I can’t lose you, too,\ndo you understand?” She turned her back on him to look into the valley. “I\ncan’t lose you, too.”\nThere was the slightest quaver in her voice, and somehow that cut him\ndown more sharply than any sword blow. He stood staring, suddenly guilty\nand ashamed and feeling an utter fool. She’d carried him, when his father\ndied and he fell all to pieces. She’d stood dry-eyed and stern by the grave,"

She’d stood dry-eyed and stern by the grave,\nand through his tears Leo had thought how heartless she was. But he saw\nnow she’d stayed strong because someone had to. She’d been carrying them\nall, ever since. Instead of being grateful, being a good son, helping her lift\nthis impossible weight, he’d moped, and whined, and picked at her as if\nthere was nothing bigger at stake than his pride.\nHe had to blink back tears himself, and he stepped up and put a gentle\nhand on her shoulder. “You won’t lose me, Mother,” he said. “You’ll never\nlose me.”\nShe laid her hand on his. An old hand, it seemed, suddenly, frail, the skin\non the back wrinkled around the knuckles.\n“I’ll lead the reserves,” he said.\nThey stood together in the wind, looking down into the valley.\nThe Party’s Over\nT\nhe clatter of the handle, the gurgle of filthy water as it surged into the\nbucket, the slop and trickle as she lifted it, breath wheezing, legs, arms,\nshoulders trembling, and passed it to May, and took an empty bucket from\nthe old man on her left, handle clattering, and bent to the water again.\nShe stood hunched, up to her knees in the river, soaked dress rolled and\ntucked into a belt made from knotted rope, all thought of propriety long\ngone. All thought of propriety had gone the moment she staggered from this\nsewer of a river the first time, shivering in her drawers.\nClatter, gurgle, slop and trickle. How long had she been filling buckets\nnow? It felt like hours. As blue evening turned to grey twilight turned to\nmad darkness lit by the glow of fires. As the distant tang of burning became\na tickling reek then an endless scratching of smoke that even with a wet rag\nacross her face made her want to choke with every breath. How long had\nshe been filling buckets now? It felt like days. It felt as if she had always\nbeen filling buckets, and always would be.\nThe women made a chain, passing slopping pails, cans, pots from hand\nto hand up the shore, children darting back through the rubbish with the\nempties so Savine could take them and fill them again, clatter, gurgle, slop\nand trickle.\nOn the other side of the river, mills were burning, flames towering into\nthe night, the great chimneys black fingers against the brilliance, their\nreflections wriggling in the slow-flowing water. Burning things drifted from\nthe sky into the streets, onto the beach, into the river, little flaming birds\nthat sputtered and popped, dancing lights floating on the black mirror for a\nmoment before they were gone.\nUp among the burning buildings, at the end of the chain of buckets, men\nstruggled with the fires, shouting, bellowing, yelling at one another. Anger,\nmaybe. Desperation, maybe. Encouragement, maybe. Savine was too tired\nto tell the difference. So tired she could hardly remember how to speak.\nHow to think.

What would her important connections at the Solar Society think if\nthey could see her now? She gave a weary snort that caught in her throat\nand nearly made her retch. Serve the arrogant bitch right, more than likely.\nThe clatter of the handle, the gurgle of water as it filled, the slop and\ntrickle as she passed it to May, her legs, her arms, her shoulders trembling\nwith the effort. Was it the cold, or the exhaustion, or the fear that made her\nshake so? What was the difference?\nHer breath snagged and she was caught with a coughing fit, sudden as a\npunch in the gut. She doubled up, wasted ribcage buzzing with each\nchoking gasp, tore the rag from her face and was sick. All she had to be sick\nwith, anyway, bitter bile and bad water, her own little contribution to the\nriver’s filth.\nShe wrested back control of her lungs, then stooped to fill the bucket.\nClatter, gurgle, slop and trickle—\nThere was a hand on her shoulder. Liddy. “It’s out,” she said.\nSavine stared dumbly at her, then up the bank towards the buildings.\nSmoke still rolled skywards, but the flames were gone. She waded from the\nriver and flopped on the slimy shingle on her hands and knees, utterly spent.\nShe arched her back, one way then the other, aches stabbing right through\ninto her heels, right up into her neck. The faintest shadow of what her father\nfelt, perhaps, every morning. Maybe it should have given her sympathy for\nhim. But as he was so fond of saying, pain only makes you sorry for\nyourself.\n“It’s out,” rasped May, sinking down on the shore beside her.\nSavine groaned as she came up to sitting, winced as she tried to work\nher fingers, cracked and wrinkled by cold water, ripped raw by the rusted\nhandles of the buckets.\n“It’s out over here,” she whispered, staring across to the great blaze still\nraging on the far bank.\n“All we can worry about is here. Over there…” The orange glow of the\nfires across the river picked up the hollows of Liddy’s face even more\nstarkly than usual. Savine understood. Over there was lost. Over there was\ngone.\nWhen she arrived in the city, she had smiled to see the building sites\neverywhere, the cranes and scaffolds, the stuff of creation. But Valbeck was\none vast demolition now.\nShe caught some fragment of her mind trying to calculate the scale of\nthe investments gone up in smoke. The buildings and machinery destroyed,\nthe people ruined. What were her own losses, for that matter? None of it felt\nvery important, compared to the pain in her hands.\nThere was a breeze, at least, carrying the haze of smoke down the river.\nEnough that Savine could get a proper breath into her raw chest.\n“What happened?” she whispered.\n“Reckon the Burners set some fires on their way out of town.” Liddy\nwiped her face on the back of her sleeve and only succeeded in smearing\nash across it. “A little parting gift.”"

Rumour is they’ll\nbe outside the city tomorrow.”\n“Orso is here?” she whispered. She had hardly thought of him since the\nuprising. Hunger, cold and the constant threat of death rather blunted one’s\nappetite for romance. Now his grin came up in her memory, painfully sharp,\nand she felt weak with a sappy welling of relief.\n“Guess they managed to prise him out of the whorehouse,” said Liddy.\n“No doubt he’ll be bringing the Inquisition with him.”\n“Oh,” said Savine, stupidly. For most people here, a horrifying prospect.\nFor her, the best news in weeks.\n“Seems the party’s over,” murmured May.\nThere was a rumble and Savine jerked up. On the other side of the river,\nthe roof of a burning mill was falling in, fountains of sparks towering into\nthe night, smoke boiling as half of one wall toppled inwards. The brave new\nage collapsing on itself.\nCrown Prince Orso was riding to her rescue. Perhaps she should have\nlaughed at that. Perhaps she should have wept at it. But she had no laughter\nand no tears left. She was a husk.\nShe sat on the bank and watched the flames dance in the water.\nEating Peas with a Sword\n“S\nhould we attack, Your Highness?”\n“Attack, Colonel Forest?” Orso did not blame the man. Violence is very\nmuch the job of a career soldier, after all. But the limits of his imagination\nwere becoming clear. “Attack who? The city itself is an asset, not an enemy.\nAs for the inhabitants, we really have no idea who is loyal and who\ndisloyal. Who a rebel and who a hostage. Making war on our own\ncitizens… it would look dreadful. We would create more rebels than we\nkilled.”\nOrso peered through his eyeglass towards Valbeck again. He could see\ntiny buildings, towers, pinprick chimneys, dark columns rising from the\nstricken city that he feared was the smoke of destruction rather than of\nindustry.\nHow he would have loved to order a glorious charge. To put rebels to the\nsword, to root through every house until he found Savine. To whisk her off\nher feet and kiss her fiercely and so on, much to her great delight. To be, for\nonce, the one to rush to her rescue. But Orso knew he had to put the\nchildren’s stories to one side and think.\nShe was tough. A great deal tougher than he was. She was resourceful. A\ngreat deal more resourceful than he was. Her best chance—everyone’s best\nchance—was for him to move slowly, cautiously and very, very boringly.\nHe blew a sigh from puffed cheeks, itchy with the beginnings of a beard he\nhoped might look military but suspected would prove to be another of his\nmany mistakes.\n“Attacking the city with an army would be like eating peas with a"

We need to be measured. Calm. The firm but necessary\nhand of authority. We need to be the grown-ups.” For once in his life.\nOrso snapped his eyeglass decisively closed. Vital to look decisive,\nespecially when you haven’t a bloody clue what you’re doing. He had been\nmaking it up as he went along all his life, of course, but never before had\nthe fates of many thousands of other people depended so directly on his\ntotal ignorance. Perhaps that’s what makes a hero, though. The towering\nself-confidence to dance at the brink of disaster and never consider the drop.\n“Surround the city,” he said, tapping the eyeglass thoughtfully into his\npalm and letting his eyes wander across the fields around Valbeck. “Deploy\nour cannons where they can be clearly seen but not used. Block every route\nin or out, cut off their supply, make it abundantly clear that we are in\ncharge.”\n“Then?” asked Forest.\n“Then find out who’s leading the rebels and…” He shrugged. “Invite\nthem to parley.”\n“War is only ever a prelude to talk,” came a voice. A man stood nearby,\nin neat civilian clothes. A man who Orso had, as far as he was aware, never\nlaid eyes upon before. A nondescript man with curly hair and a length of\nwood in one hand. He smiled at Orso. “My master would thoroughly\napprove, Your Highness.”\nAs a crown prince, Orso was used to forgetting nine-tenths of the people\nhe was introduced to, as well as to total strangers sticking their noses into\nhis business, and so he remained scrupulously polite. “Pardon me, but I am\nnot sure we have met…?”\n“This is Yoru Sulfur,” offered Superior Pike. “A member of the Order of\nMagi.”\n“I was just now struggling to put out a fire in the North when the\nunmistakable tang of the Union in flames reached my nose.” Sulfur smiled\nwider. “Never any peace, eh? Never the slightest peace.”\n“His Eminence the Arch Lector,” said Pike, “as well as His Majesty your\nfather, were very keen that Master Sulfur should join us.”\n“Merely to observe.” Sulfur waved it away as if the favour of the\nUnion’s two most powerful men was nothing to comment on. “And perhaps\noffer some trifling advice, if I can. As a representative of my master, Bayaz,\nFirst of the Magi. Pressing business detains him in the West, but the\nstability of the Union has ever been a prime concern of his, even so.\nStability, stability, he’s always saying. A stable Union means a stable world.\nThis business…” And he shook his head sadly as he looked towards the\nsmoke over Valbeck. “Is quite the opposite. Why, the very first thing they\ndid was burn the bank.”\n“I… see,” said Orso. Meaning that he did not see at all.

He turned back\nto Forest, where things made at least a little more sense. “What was I\nsaying?”\n“Surround the city, Your Highness.”\n“Ah, yes. Proceed!”\nForest gave a stiff salute and the orders rang out, followed by the tramp\nand jingle as the latest column of the Crown Prince’s Division left the road\nand fanned out into the fields to begin the encirclement.\n“Master Tallow?” said Orso.\nThe boy crept forward. “Yes, sir, I mean, Your… er…”\n“Highness,” threw in Tunny, grinning ever so slightly.\n“You’ve been in the city?”\nHe nodded, those great luminous eyes fixed on Orso.\n“And you observed a meeting of these Breakers?”\nHe nodded again.\n“Any notion who’s in charge in there?”\n“Risinau, the Superior of the Inquisition. Called himself the Weaver.\nSeemed like he was leading them, but he talked like a madman. Then there\nwas a woman called Judge.” He gave a little shiver. “But she seemed even\nmadder’n Risinau. Then there was an old fellow. Mulmer. Molmer.\nSomething like that. He seemed… decent, I reckon.”\n“Mulmer it is, then, I suppose.” Orso frowned at Tallow. “Have you\neaten today? You look bloody famished.”\nTallow blinked.\n“You like chicken?”\nHe slowly nodded.\n“Yolk?”\n“Your Highness?”\n“Go to my cook and get the boy a chicken with… well, with whatever\nhe wants.”\nYolk looked a little sour.\n“Sour about that, Yolk? Think the task’s beneath you?”\n“Well—”\n“Any task I could give is far above you. Get the boy a damn chicken,\nthen I want you and him to go out towards Valbeck under a white flag—\nhave we got a white flag, Tunny?”\nTunny shrugged. “Stick a shirt on a stick, job done.”\n“Chicken first, then shirt on a stick, then head up to the nearest barricade\nand tell them Crown Prince Orso would very much like to speak to Mulmer\nof the Breakers. Tell them I am ready to negotiate. Tell them I am keen to\nnegotiate. Tell them I feel about negotiation the way a stallion feels about a\nmare.”\n“Yes, Your Highness,” said Yolk, still looking somewhat sour.\n“Yes, Your Highness,” said Tallow, his eyes still wide. Narrowing them\nsimply did not appear to be an option for the boy.\nOrso stood frowning towards the city as they walked away, one hand on\nhis stomach. “Hildi?” he called.\nThe girl was sitting cross-legged in her drummer-boy’s uniform, making\na chain of daisies. “Little busy here.”\n“Get me a chicken, would you?”\n“I could eat.”\n“Get everyone a chicken, then. Chicken, Master Sulfur?”\n“Very kind, Your Highness, but I must keep to a very specific diet.”\n“The discipline of the magical arts, eh?”\nSulfur grinned wide, showing two rows of shiny white teeth. “We all\nmust make sacrifices.”"

I fear I want everyone to\nlike me, Master Sulfur.”\n“We all do, Your Highness, but he who tries to please everyone pleases\nno one at all.”\n“I wish I could deny that, too, but I’ve certainly pleased no one so far.”\nHe looked over at the magus who, aside from the staff, was about the least\nmagical-looking man one could have asked for. “Don’t suppose you could\nsolve all this with… I don’t know… a spell?”\n“Magic can level mountains. I have seen it. But there is always a cost,\nand it rises with each passing year. In my experience, swords offer\nconsiderably better value.”\n“You speak more like an accountant than a wizard.”\n“A sign of the times, Your Highness.”\n“Superior Pike? Can I tempt you to chicken?”\nThe superior did not look pleased by the thought of chicken. Indeed, it\nwas the most Orso could do to stand his ground as the man’s hideously\nburned face advanced on him. “You mean to treat with the rebels?”\n“I do, Superior.” Orso gave a false chuckle. “After all, what harm can\ntalk do?”\n“A very great deal. I am not sure His Eminence will approve.”\n“Is there anything His Eminence does approve of?” Orso grinned, but\nPike’s face remained impassive. Perhaps it was the burns. Perhaps he was\nthoroughly tickled but physically unable to smile. Perhaps he was chortling\naway on the inside the whole time. It did not seem likely. “Look, Superior,\nthe wonderful thing about being crown prince is you can talk and wheedle\nand promise and bluster and everyone has to listen.” He leaned close to\nmurmur in the melted remnants of Pike’s ear. “But you never have the\npower to actually do anything.”\nPike raised one brow. Or looked as if he would have, had he any to raise.\nThen he gave the faintest nod, perhaps even a nod of approval, and faded\nback to confer with Sulfur.\nOrso was left alone in the wheatfield with Tunny, the Steadfast Standard\nresting covered in the crook of one arm.\n“What is it, Corporal?”\n“I never saw more harm done than by the heroes who couldn’t wait to\nget started.”\nOrso popped open his top button. Uniforms were a great help around the\nbelly but they could get awfully tight at the throat. “Well, if I excel at\nanything, it’s doing nothing.”\n“You know what, Your Highness? I’m starting to think you might make\na better-than-average king.”\n“So you’re always telling me.”\n“Yes.” Tunny had a knowing smirk as he watched the men of the Crown\nPrince’s Division steadily spread out around the city. “But I never actually\nmeant it before.”\nThe Battle of Red Hill\n“H\now’s your leg?” asked Rikke.\n“Sore,” said Isern, wrinkling her nose as she picked at the stitches with a"

It was Rikke’s turn to wrinkle her nose. The smell\nof it was quite impossible to describe. “By the dead,” trying to hold her\nbreath, “what is that?”\nIsern started to wind a fresh bandage around her thigh. “Better you don’t\nknow. I might have to spread some on you if you get arrow-pricked, and I\nwouldn’t want you arguing.” She slipped a pin through the bandage and\nstood, wincing as she rubbed at her thigh with her thumb, flexing her knee,\ntesting her weight on it. “Knowledge isn’t always a gift, d’you see?\nSometimes it’s better we be swaddled in the comforting darkness of\nignorance.”\nShe pushed a pellet of chagga up behind her lip, then rolled another\nbetween finger and thumb and handed it over. Rikke chomped on it,\nsavoured that sour, earthy taste which she’d found so vile when she started\nchewing it but that now she could never get enough of, and pushed it down\nbehind her lip.\nIt was cold. No fires in case Stour’s scouts saw them and spoiled the\ntrap, and she’d hardly slept and she was aching and hungry but sick at the\nsame time and bloody hell she felt nervous. Kept fussing with her fingers,\nfussing at the chagga pellet with her tongue, fussing at the runes around her\nneck, fussing at the ring through her nose—\n“Stop fussing,” said Isern. “Neither of us’ll be fighting.”\n“I can feel worried for those who will, can’t I?”\n“Meaning your Young Lion?” Isern grinned, tip of her tongue showing\nthrough that hole in her teeth. “Can’t spend your whole life fucking, you\nknow.”\n“No.” Rikke gave a smoky sigh. “Something to aim for, though.”\n“I’ve heard less noble goals, ’tis true.”\nThe silence stretched. The silence, and the nerves, and somewhere\nsomeone started up a song in a deep bass. That one about the Battle in the\nHigh Places, where her father laid Bethod low. Old battles. Old victories.\nShe wondered whether some time in the future, folk would sing songs about\nthe Battle of Red Hill, and if they did, who’d be the winners and who the\nlosers.\n“When will they get here?” she asked for the hundredth time.\nIsern leaned on her spear and frowned off to the east. The sun was rising\nthere, a brilliant crescent over the hills that set the edges of the clouds on\nfire. The valley bellow was dark still, here or there a glitter on the stream,\nmist hanging over the trees that marched off to the North. “Could be soon,”\nmused Isern. “Could be later. Might be they change their mind and don’t\ncome at all.”"

No doubt it was somehow in\nleague with his mother.\n“Patience is the parent of success,” murmured Jurand, with so gentle a\ntouch on Leo’s shoulder he only just felt it. “Stolicus.”\n“Huh.” Normally, as the sun rose, Leo would’ve been training. He’d\nheard Bremer dan Gorst, well into his fifties, still trained for three hours\nevery day, so he’d determined to do the same. But what’s the point of\ntraining if you end up stuck on your arse in a village miles from the fight?\nHe took a hard breath and let it smoke away. His thousandth of the morning\nso far.\n“Nothing to do but wait.” Whitewater Jin carefully pushed his sausages\naround the pan and made them sizzle. The fork looked tiny in his paw of a\nhand. “Wait, and eat.”\nThe smell was making Leo’s stomach rumble, but there was no way he\ncould think of eating. He was too nervous. Too impatient. Too frustrated.\n“By the dead!” He flung an arm towards the men scattered about the\nvillage, already in their armour. Angland’s cavalry. The best and the\nbrightest, sitting idle. “She should be letting us fight! What’s she thinking?”\n“I saw an army mishandled in Styria,” said Barniva. “This is not what it\nlooks like.”\n“If you ask me,” said Jurand, “the lady governor’s a hell of a general.”\n“No one did ask you,” snapped Leo, even though he just had.\nJurand heaved out a sigh, and Barniva drew his blanket tight about his\nshoulders, and they went back to watching the sausages sizzle.\nLeo frowned up at the sound of hooves. One rider trotting down the\nrutted track that led from the bridge. Antaup, loose in his saddle.\n“Morning!” he called, scraping that lock of dark hair back with his\nfingers.\n“Any news?” Leo couldn’t keep the eager little warble out of his voice,\nthough it was perfectly clear there was no news at all. He was needy as a\njilted lover, unable to stop pining no matter how often he was turned down.\n“No news,” said Antaup, swinging from his saddle. He peered over Jin’s"

He peered over Jin’s\nbig shoulder at the pan. “Don’t suppose you lads have a sausage spare?”\nBarniva grinned up. “For a boy with a smile as pretty as yours? I think\nwe can find a sausage.”\n“Do you have to?” snapped Leo, curling his lip with disgust. “What did\nmother say?” He right away regretted his choice of words, but how does a\nman make taking orders from his mother sound good?\n“She said sit tight.” Antaup leaned on Jin’s shoulder, made him turn,\nthen reached around his blind side and nimbly stole the fork from his plate.\n“She said she’d let you know if anything changed.” And he stretched over\nto fork one of the sausages from the pan.\n“Oy!” snapped Jin, elbowing him away.\nLeo frowned up towards the red-topped hill, a black lump against the\npinking sky, here and there the telltale glint of metal where the men were\ngetting ready for battle. Or for just another day of waiting.\nThe waiting, the waiting, the endless bloody waiting. He really was the\nworst man in the world at doing nothing.\n“I’m going up there!” And he grabbed his helmet and strode for his\nhorse.\n“And she said don’t go up there!” called Antaup with his mouth full.\nLeo froze for a moment, angrily clenching his jaw. Then he strode on.\n“I’m bloody going anyway!”\n“I’ll come with you,” said Jurand. “Keep a sausage for me!”\n“For a boy with such delicate features as yours,” said Barniva, laughter\nin his voice, “I’ll always have a sausage.”\n“By the dead,” grumbled Leo, hunching his shoulders.\n“I’ve got a feeling about today,” said Wonderful.\nClover was fully occupied trimming a blister on his big toe. “Good\nfeeling or bad?”\n“Just a feeling. Something’s going to happen.”\n“Well, something happens every day.”\n“Something big, you fool.”\n“Ah,” said Clover. “Well, I hope I’m left out of it. I like little things,\nmostly.”\n“You must be pleased wi’ your cock, then.” Magweer, sneering down\nfrom his horse with the sun behind.\nClover saw no pressing need to look away from his feet. “A cock’s not\nfor pleasing yourself, boy, it’s for pleasing others. Maybe that’s where\nyou’re going wrong.”\nMagweer bristled. Always the ones quickest to insults got the thinnest\nskin, for some reason. “You spend more time on your blisters than your\nweapons.”\n“My blisters are more important,” said Clover.\nMagweer’s ill-favoured face crunched up in a clueless scowl.\n“If you’re lucky, you might get through a whole campaign without\ndrawing your sword.” Clover gave his blister one last shave with the point\nof his little knife, then sat back to admire the results. “But you will, without\nquestion, be using your feet.”\n“The man has a point,” said Wonderful.\nMagweer spat. “No fucking idea why, but Stour wants the two o’ you up\nfront with him.”"

That boy seemed determined to butt\nheads with him. You let things go with most men, they let things go, too.\nBut some are just fixed on taking offence. “Wouldn’t dare, Magweer,” he\nsaid. “But wars are depressing things, whatever the songs say. We must\nlighten the mood where we can, eh, Wonderful?”\n“I smile whenever possible,” she said, stony-faced.\nMagweer looked from one of them to the other, then gave a sour hiss,\nspat once more for luck and wrenched his horse roughly around to the west.\n“Just get up there with the scouts soon as you can or there’ll be trouble.”\nAnd he rode off, mud flicking from his horse’s hooves, nearly riding down\nsome poor woman who’d been off fetching water and making her drop her\nbuckets in the mud.\n“I like that boy a lot. Reminds me of me as a young man.” Clover shook\nhis head. “If I’d been an absolute cunt.”\n“You were an absolute cunt,” said Wonderful. “And I’ve observed no\nsignificant changes in that regard.”\nClover started pulling his boot on. “Or, indeed, in any other.”\nWonderful scrubbed worriedly at the back of her shaved head as she\nfrowned off down the road to the west. “Damn it, though,” she said, “I’ve\ngot a feeling about today.”\n“No sign,” said Rikke’s father, offering her his battered eyeglass.\n“If you say there’s no sign,” she said, “I daresay there isn’t any. You’re\nthe War Chief. I’m… I don’t know, a seer, maybe?” Sounded like a bloody\npresumptuous title. “Just… a really shit one.”\n“Sooner or later, you’ll have to stop hiding your talents, girl. Your Long\nEye may be patchy but your short ones are still way sharper’n mine.”\nRikke sighed, and took the eyeglass, and peered over the weed-sprouting\nold battlements, keeping low just in case. Spots of gorse on the hillside.\nFast-flowing water in the stream. Sheep dotted about the yellow-green\ngrass. Sunlight and shadow chasing each other down the valley as the\ngusting wind dragged clouds across the sky. There were a couple of\nhundred Union men gathered around the bridge, where a wagon had been\ncarefully positioned to look like it had just that moment broke an axle and\nwas blocking things up halfway across.\nThe bait on their hook. Seemed a laughably obvious trick right then, but\ntricks always do when you know how they’re managed. Fish keep biting,\neven so.\n“No sign.” Rikke handed back the glass, and clapped her father on the\nshoulder, and slipped down the steps.\nThe yard of the ruin was crammed with Oxel’s and Red Hat’s Carls,\nchecking their gear, passing food, talking softly to one another.

Truth is, battles are\nmore often won with spades than blades. Roads, and ditches, and trenches,\nand proper shit-pits.

He had a sword in one hand and an axe in the\nother and he was frowning up the slope. Not at her, but at the tower beyond.\n“Who’s that?” she said.\n“Who’s who?”\nThe pale man beckoned with his axe, and Rikke’s jaw fell open as a\ncouple of dozen others slipped from the trees around him, all well armed.\nShe jumped up, near falling over that pretty weed, and pointing wildly\ndown towards them.\n“There’s men in the trees!” she screeched.\nA few Carls scrambled onto the crumbling wall, staring down. Oxel was\none. Rikke was waiting for him to roar out for more men, but all he did was\nturn his shifty sneer from the trees to her and spit.\n“What the hell you talking about, girl?” he growled. “There’s no one\nthere.”\n“Fucking mad bitch,” she heard one of the others mutter as they drifted\nback into the ruin, shaking their heads.\nRikke wondered if she was going mad. Or more mad, maybe. Men were\nflooding from the trees now. Hundreds of the bastards. “You see ’em, don’t\nyou?” she asked Isern in a small voice.\nThe hillwoman leaned on her spear, calmly chewing. “The men are rude,\nbut the men are right.

There’s no one there.” She gave Rikke a painful jab\nwith her sharp elbow. “But maybe someone will be.”\n“Oh, no.” And Rikke covered her eyes with a hand and the left one was\nhot. “Wanna be sick.” She bent over and coughed out an acrid little\nmouthful, but when she looked up, the men were still there, too brightly lit\nsince the sun was still low, a great standard in their midst, flapping hard\neven though the breeze had died. “They even got a flag.”\n“What flag?”\n“Black with a red circle.”\nIsern’s frown got harder. “That was Bethod’s standard. Now it’s Black\nCalder’s.”\nRikke was sick again. Just a little string of drool this time, and she spat\nand wiped her mouth. “Thought he… was way off north.”\n“You cannot force the Long Eye open,” murmured Isern. “But when it\nopens by itself, it’s a fool who doesn’t see.” She turned and limped quick\nacross the rubble-strewn yard of the fortress, making men grumble as she\nshouldered past. “Black Calder’s always had a bad habit of turning up\nwhere he shouldn’t.”\n“So what’re you doing?”\n“Warning your father.”\n“You sure?” muttered Rikke as she followed Isern up the crumbling\nsteps, still glimpsing those men out of the corner of her eye. An army of\n’em now. “I mean, what if they’re going to turn up next week? Or next\nmonth? What if they turned up years ago!”\n“Then we’ll look like a right pair o’ fools.” Isern grinned at her as she\nlimped up onto the roof of the tower. “But at least we won’t be two corpses\nin a big heap of corpses. Dogman!”\n“Isern-i-Phail,” muttered Rikke’s father with a sideways glance. “Make\nit good, I’ve got a battle to—”\n“Black Calder’s in those woods.” She nodded off to the North.\n“Planning to sneak men around you, I reckon.”\n“You seen ’em?”\n“I must confess, I did not. But your daughter did.” She slapped a heavy\nhand down on Rikke’s shoulder. “The moon has smiled upon us all and\nblessed her with the rare gift o’ the Long Eye. We should make ready for\nblood.”\n“You’re not joking.” Rikke’s father pointed in the opposite direction.\n“Stour Nightfall might be coming down that road any bloody minute and\nLady Brock’s counting on us to be one-half of a trap for him! We don’t\narrive, the whole plan’s in the shit.”\nIsern grinned like this was all quite the lark. “Not half as deep as if\nBlack Calder sidles up our arses while we’re facing t’other way, though,\nd’you see?”\nRikke’s father pressed at his temples. “By the dead. I can’t turn around\njust on your say-so, Rikke. I can’t.”\n“I know,” she said, shrugging her shoulders high as they’d go. “I\nwouldn’t.”\n“You seen ’em, though?” croaked Shivers."

The one at the\nfront’s smiling right at me.”\n“Describe him.”\n“A long, lean, pale bastard with an axe and a sword, sort of hunched\nover, all elbows. Ugh.” And she had to bend over herself, hands on her\nknees, head spinning.\n“Sounds a lot like the Nail,” said Shivers, frowning down towards the\nwoods. “If Black Calder sent a man around the back, the Nail’s the sort o’\nman he’d send.”\nRikke’s father gave a low grunt. “Maybe.”\n“Give me a few Carls,” said Shivers. “I’ll have a root around those\nwoods. I find nothing, nothing lost.”\nRikke’s father looked from Shivers, to Isern, to Rikke, and back. “Root\naround, then, but quick. If we’re called for, we can’t wait.”\nShivers nodded and slipped down the crumbling steps. The sun was\ngetting higher, and down in the valley on the brown strip of the road, men\nwere moving. A few, and coming carefully. “Oh, by the dead.” Rikke\ncovered her eye with her hand, felt it still throbbing hot against her palm.\n“Tell me you see them?”\n“Oh, aye. Stour Nightfall’s scouts, I reckon.” And Isern spat. “’Course I\nsee them.”\nMuddy grey dawn had become muddy grey morning by the time Leo rode\nup through the red bracken on the hillside. The men of Angland sat in\nmassed ranks where they were hidden from the valley, armed and ready.\nSome stood to salute, a few held up their swords. Others called out, “The\nYoung Lion!” against their orders to stay quiet. Seemed the soldiers\napproved of him a lot more than his mother did.\nShe was kneeling in the bracken just beyond the summit, an eyeglass\ntrained on the valley, a whispering group of scouts and officers around her.\nShe shook her head as he crept over, keeping low. “I thought I gave\nAntaup orders that you shouldn’t come up here?”\n“Yes, and I came anyway…” He trailed off. There were men in the\nvalley. Mounted men, spread out, watching their little show of\nincompetence down at the bridge. Northmen, without a doubt. “Nightfall’s\nscouts?” he asked in an eager whisper.\nShe handed him her eyeglass. “And his main body is following close\nbehind. Head of the column is there at the farm.”\nLeo trained the glass on a few pale farm buildings higher up the valley.\nMetal gleamed on the brown strip of road. Mail and spear points. A column\nof armed men, moving towards the bridge. Carls, from the little spots of\nbright colour which must be their shields. Like seeing one ant in the grass\nand suddenly seeing dozens, Leo became aware of another column, and\nanother."

There was something waving beside the farm. A tall\ngrey flag, and though he couldn’t be sure at this distance, he’d a feeling\nthere was a black wolf on it.\n“Nightfall’s standard,” he whispered.\n“Yes.” His mother pulled her eyeglass from his limp grip and set it to her\nown eye again. “And this time, I’ve no doubt, the Great Wolf is here in\nperson.”\n“What did these bastards do?” asked Clover, frowning up at the bodies.\n“They was on the Dogman’s side,” said Greenway, nodding like a family\ndangling from a tree was a job well done.\nCouple of Thralls had dragged a cupboard from the farmhouse, now they\nshoved it over in the dirt and started hacking at it with axes. Clover squinted\nat ’em, bemused.\n“What is it they think an axe will reveal that opening the doors won’t?”\n“Hidden stuff. Gold, maybe.”\n“Gold? You’re having a laugh.”\nGreenway frowned a pouty frown—aside from sneers, it was his one\nexpression. “Silver, then.”\n“Silver? If these bastards had silver, let alone gold, why the hell would\nthey be up here farming for a pittance? They’d be in town, drunk, which is\nwhere I should bloody be.”\n“Best to be sure,” said one of the men.\n“Oh, aye,” said Clover. “Daresay you’ll be burning the house once\nyou’ve found nothing, ’cause fire is pretty.”\nThe man glanced over at Greenway, somewhat sheepish, and scratched\nhis head. Seemed that was exactly what he’d been planning.\n“And if Stour wants somewhere to sleep tonight, he can curl up in the\nashes, can he?” Clover strolled past, shaking his head. What a waste. Waste\nof people, waste of things, waste of effort. But that was war for you.\nNothing he hadn’t seen a dozen times before. If the Great Wolf wanted to\ndecorate his new land with corpses and have creaking ropes for music, then\nwho was he to complain?\nThe king-in-waiting was a little further on with Wonderful, considering\nthe view while he chewed on a stolen apple.\n“Don’t like the looks of this,” said Clover, folding his arms tight. “Not\none bit.”\n“No,” said Wonderful. “It fucking stinks.”\nThe road dropped into a grassy valley ahead, a steep hill on either side.\nOne had some old ruin clinging to its rocky top, the other was bigger and\nshallower, red bracken giving the crown a dried-blood look Clover didn’t\nmuch care for.\nBetween the two fells, down in the valley’s bottom, a little bridge\ncrossed a stream. Looked like there might be a few Union men tangled up\non both sides of it. Clover’s eyes weren’t all they once had been, but he\nthought he could see a flag waving above them.\nStour’s eyes were sharper, and thoughtfully narrowed in its direction."

She had her lips pressed together tight\nlike she was trying not to shit herself. Stour frowned at her, then at Clover.\n“Are you making light o’ me, you old fucker?”\nClover looked dumbstruck. “Man like me, make light of a man like you?\nI wouldn’t dare. I’m agreeing the Young Lion is a stupid name for a man to\nhave. For one thing, he’s not a lion, is he? For another he’s, what, twenty-\nish?”\n“About that,” said Wonderful.\n“So… considering the lifespan of a lion…” Clover squinted up at the\ngrey sky, no idea how long a lion lived, “probably… maybe… he’d be quite\nan old lion, would he?”\nHe kept his face blank as fresh snow, counting on the short attention\nspan common to famous warriors and, indeed, soon enough, the Great Wolf\nforgot all about it, fully occupied glowering down the valley, towards that\nbridge. Towards that standard. He gave a great sniff. “Let’s have a poke at\nthose bastards.”\nAll of a sudden, Wonderful looked like shitting herself for very different\nreasons. “Don’t know about that, Chief. You sure?”\n“Ever known me to not be sure?”\nIn Clover’s experience, only idiots were ever sure about anything.

Bring up a couple of hundred\nCarls, Wonderful.” And Stour bunched his fists, white-knuckle tight, like he\ncouldn’t wait to start throwing punches. “Let’s give those bastards a poke.”\nShe pointed that brow of hers at Clover but he could only shrug, so she\nturned and bellowed at one of the scouts to bring up more men.

Strange sounds floated up, twisted by wind and distance.\n“That bloody fool’s stumbled right into it!” Rikke’s father was licking\nhis lips, but she couldn’t share his joy. Couldn’t twitch free of the feeling it\nwas them stumbling into something. She glanced towards the trees again.\nThe men she’d seen with the Long Eye had faded now. Maybe she caught\ntheir ghostly after-images. Maybe nothing.\n“We can’t wait any longer. Red Hat?”\n“Aye, Chief?”\n“Send Oxel and Hardbread the word—”\n“Wait!” hissed Rikke. There was something moving in the woods.\nBranches thrashing, a glimmer of metal through the leaves. “Tell me you\nsee that!”\nHer father’s face had turned grim. “I see that.”\nShivers burst from the trees, running full tilt for the fortress. Some of his\nscouts shot from the woods around him, one looking back as they started to\nscramble up the grassy hillside.\n“Man the walls!” roared Shivers. Arrows flitted from the trees, twittering\nabout him. One of his men took a shaft in the back and slipped, tottered up,\ncarried on running with the shaft sticking from his shoulder. “Woods are\nfull o’ the bastards!”\nRikke’s father stood up tall at the crumbling battlements, bellowing\ndown into the yard. “Man the walls! Black Calder’s coming from the\nNorth!”\nThen Rikke saw that pale man step out of the trees, right to the spot\nshe’d already seen him in. He beckoned with his axe, just the way she’d\nalready seen him do, and men started to spill from the woods around him.\n“It’s the Nail!” roared Red Hat, waving his sword, and warriors\nswarmed towards the ruined walls, falling over each other in their haste to\nshift from the south side of the fortress to the north.\nNow came the standard, black with the red circle. Bethod’s standard.\nBlack Calder’s standard. Suddenly the treeline was alive with men.\nIsern gave a sigh. “There’s the problem with looking for a fight.” And\nshe pulled the deerskin cover from the bright blade of her spear.\n“Sometimes you get more fight than you wanted.”\nSeemed the Nail was smiling right at Rikke now. Just the way she’d\nknown he would.\nWithout taking her eyes from the valley, Leo’s mother held up a finger. “Get\nthe troops on their feet.”\nLeo heard the calls of the officers spreading out across the back of the\nhill. The great scrape and rattle as the men stood, took up their weapons,\nbegan to form ranks.\nThe valley was flooded with Northmen now. Hundreds of them.\nThousands. An iron plague, spreading steadily down the road towards the\nbridge. Leo felt utterly useless.

Just a little longer.”\nThe time stretched, slow, silent, unbearably tense. A bird hovered, high\noverhead, feathers ruffling in the wind, poised and ready to swoop.\n“Knowing the right moment.” Her eyes flickered over the disorganised\nfighting at the bridge, across the columns of Northmen in the valley, up to\nthe farm, and back. “My father always told me that was half a general’s\njob.”\n“The other half?” asked Leo.\n“Looking like you know the right moment.” And she stood up tall and\nslapped the dirt from the knees of her skirt. “Ritter?” A freckled little boy\nstepped up with a bugle clenched tight in one fist.\n“Your Grace?”\n“Sound the advance.”\nIt rang out over the valley, piercingly loud, and there was an almighty\nclattering as several thousand armoured men began to march.\n“Shit,” said Wonderful, frowning at the red hill.\nClover felt that familiar sinking feeling as he followed her eyes. That\nfeeling he’d got at least once in every battle he’d ever fought in. Spear tips\nshowed over the brow, against the spitting sky, then helmets, then men.\nRanks and ranks of men. Union foot, well armed and organised and coming\ndown from the high ground on their flank.\nThey didn’t seem to trouble the Great Wolf any. Quite the reverse.\n“Lovely,” he purred, grinning like an eager groom watching his bride\nshown in. “Fucking beautiful. Form a shield wall facing that fell and we’ll\nget to grips with these Union bastards.”\n“Lovely? We don’t know where the Dogman is!” Clover pointed up\ntowards the ruined fortress with a stabbing finger. Even his old eyes could\npick out figures on the roof of that tower. “What if there’s men up there?\nWe’ll be showing ’em our bare arses!”\n“I guess.” Stour looked back to the bridge, in no hurry. It was a right\nmess down there now, corpses scattered, arrows flitting, spears tangled, men\nstruggling in the water, even. Stour tapped a finger against his pursed lips as\nhe watched, like a cook judging whether to toss a pinch more salt in the pot,\nrather’n a War Chief sending men to their deaths. But maybe that’s just the\nkind o’ carelessness with other men’s lives a general needs. “Bring\neveryone up. I think I’ll have that bridge.”\nWonderful looked stunned, and well she might’ve. “You’re playing their\nbloody game!” she said. “It’s a fucking trap!”\nStour’s wet eyes rolled towards her. “’Course it is, but who’s caught in\nit?”\n“We are,” snapped Clover, “and tripping over our cocks on the way.\nWhat’ll your father say to this?”\n“He’ll be fucking delighted.” The wolf-grin spread across Stour’s face.\n“The whole thing was his idea.”"

These fools think they’ll catch us with our trousers\ndown.” He leaned close to Clover. “But it’s us who’ll catch them. Come on,\nyou old bastards!” And he drew his sword, spun it around in his fingers\nlightly as an eating knife. “We’ve a fucking battle to win!”\nRikke never saw a battle before, and she hoped she never saw another.\nBlack Calder’s men pressed in on every side. The tumbledown wall had\nbecome a mass of straining men, a great tangle of shields and clattering,\nsliding, stabbing spears. One had a flag on it that had got all wrapped\naround a Carl’s arm, and he was shrieking with fury as he tried to drag it\nfree and only got himself more tangled. Rikke saw a spear blade poking\ninto his cheek and he twisted and shouted but couldn’t be heard, couldn’t be\nmoved, was eased onto that spear by the weight of men behind, the trickle\nof blood becoming a bubbling rush and Rikke looked away, the breath\ncrawling in her throat.\nShe saw her father on the steps of the tower, veins standing from his\nneck as he roared words she couldn’t hear over the screams of pain and\nscreams of rage. How could anyone bring order to this chaos? Might as well\ncommand a storm to stop blowing.\nShe saw a boy with curly hair just staring, taking a step one way, then\nthe other way, face white and pale and his jaw hanging open, not knowing\nwhat to do. Rikke wondered if he was going to die here. Wondered if she\nwas going to die here.\nThe rain was coming heavier now, on a chill wind, beading weapons and\narmour, sticking hair to snarling faces, turning ground churned by boots and\nbodies to sticky mud.\n“Heave!” The shield wall was no more than ten strides from her,\nbuckling and twisting, shields shrieking and scraping, boots sliding as men\ntried desperately to shove the attackers back. One stood tall to lash over the\ntop of the wall with his axe. Stood again and squealed as a spear caught him\nunder the rim of his helmet. He fell back, shrieking, thrashing, blood\nleaking between the fingers clapped to his face. “My eye! My eye!”\nArrows flitted down, clicked from the ground, bounced from a dead\ncampfire. A man sank to his knees, leaning on his mace, face all crumpled,\ndrooling, wheezing, a shaft in his back.\n“Careful,” said Isern, easing Rikke behind a broken pillar, mossy old\ndevil faces carved around the head. “Careful,” and Rikke felt something\ncold brush her palm, and saw that Isern had slipped a knife into her hand,\nand she stared at it as if she’d never seen such a thing before.\nShe saw a man sitting on the ground, cursing as he fiddled with his\nbloody sleeve, blood in his beard, axe dangling from one wrist.

Another man gibbered, mail pulled up to\nshow a little slit that welled blood and when the healer wiped it welled\nagain and she wiped it again but the blood came too fast to stop, too fast.\nThere was a kind of groan, and at the crumbling wall where that pretty\nweed had grown the shields buckled, gave, and Rikke stared as Black\nCalder’s men surged into the fortress.\nA knot of them, mail rain-glinting and mud-spattered. A wedge of them,\nbristling with sharpened steel. A dagger-thrust of them, screaming their war\ncries, and at their very front a man with gold on his helmet and a green tree\non a shield all scored and dented. He rushed right at Rikke with an axe held\nhigh.\nThat would’ve been a good moment to run, but maybe she’d run\nenough. Maybe the madness was catching. Without thinking, she dropped\ninto a crouch, and bared her teeth, and raised her knife to meet him.\nHe twisted at a mad screech and Isern sprang from the crumbling steps\non one leg, point of her spear darting over his shield-rim, catching him\nunder the jaw and ripping his throat wide. He wobbled another step or two,\nblood showering down that green tree and turning it red, then his knees\nwent and he fell on his face, gold-chased helmet bouncing off and rolling\nright between Rikke’s boots.\nShe saw Shivers snarling, hacking, snarling, metal eye shining. She saw\nRed Hat shooting arrows into the midst. She saw other men she knew, some\nof her father’s closest, good men, gentle men, screeching hate, shoving with\nshields, chopping with swords and axes.\nThat wedge of Black Calder’s men was choked off, and hemmed in, and\ncut down one by one, stabbed with spears, shoved over with shields,\nstomped on the ground. One huge warrior was left, wearing battered plates\nof armour, swinging a great axe around in heedless circles, rattling and\nclattering against the spears that stabbed at him.\nThen a snarling Thrall sprang onto his back, caught him around the\nthroat, hacking at him with a knife. Another darted in and chopped at his\nleg, brought him lurching onto one knee. Then they were all around him,\nOxel using his sword like a pick in both hands to chisel his helmet off,\nchisel his skull open.\nShe saw Isern, tongue pressed into the hole in her teeth as she stabbed\none stricken warrior after another with her spear.

Through waving\nspears she saw the Nail, up on the wall, shaking his axe, blood-dotted face\ntwisted with fury and laughter at once, screaming, “Kill the fuckers! Kill\nthe fuckers!”\nArrows flickered over, the noise of fighting like hail on a tin roof. Rikke\nsaw ghosts now, among the fighting, among the killing, among the dead.\nGhosts of men fighting, killing, dying. Battles long done, maybe, and\nbattles yet to come, and she slid down the pillar until her backside hit mud,\nknife dropping from her hand into the dirt, and sat there trembling with her\nsmarting eyes squeezed shut.\nLeo stood at the top of the hill, hands helplessly clenching and unclenching.\nIt was the greatest battle he’d ever seen. The greatest the North had seen\nsince the Battle of Osrung, where his mother loved to say he’d been\nconceived.\nNightfall’s shield wall had bent back when the Anglanders first charged.\nIt had buckled, looked ready to give under the strain, but it had held. More\nNorthmen had filtered down the road to shore it up and pushed the\nAnglanders back to the base of the red hill. Now there was a boiling\nengagement all the way along the valley bottom, the mad clamour echoing\nfrom the fells, the carnage at the bridge at one end.\nIf the Dogman swept down from the other side of the valley now, it\nwould all be over. Nightfall would be surrounded, shattered, they could take\nevery one of his men prisoner. Perhaps they could even capture the Great\nWolf himself and make the bastard kneel.\nBut the Dogman didn’t appear, and the glee of the officers on the hilltop\nturned to concern, then grim worry.\n“Where the hell is the Dogman?” muttered Leo’s mother. The ruin on\nthe far side of the valley was just a ghost through the thickening rain. “He\nshould be attacking.”\n“Yes,” said Leo. He couldn’t say more. His mouth was too dry.\n“Can’t see a thing in this damn rain,” she fretted.\n“No,” said Leo. He’d always been a doer. Sitting idle while other men\nfought was torture.\n“If he doesn’t come soon…”\nThey could all see it. Some of Nightfall’s Thralls were still dribbling\nonto the battlefield. If the Dogman didn’t come soon, they might get around\nthe flank and the Union line would crumble.\nA rider came lurching up the back of the hill, pushing his mount hard. A\nNorthman, rattled and dirt-spattered.\nLeo’s mother strode up as he slithered from the saddle. “What’s become\nof the Dogman?”\n“Black Calder came out o’ the woods,” he said, breathing hard. “We’re\nonly just hanging on at the ruin. No way we can help with the attack.”\nOne officer swallowed. Another stared down into the valley. A third\nseemed to deflate, like a punctured wineskin.\n“Black Calder was supposed to be a day away,” breathed Leo’s mother,\nher eyes wide."

They were caught in their own trap,\noutnumbered and facing destruction. He stared towards the bridge. That was\nwhere he belonged, where the names were made and tomorrow’s songs\nwritten. He could make the difference. He knew he could.\nStrategy had failed. It was time to fight.\n“We have to send in the reserves.” He stepped close to his mother. No\nwhining now, no wheedling. Just the simple truth. “There’s no choice.\nWe’re committed.”\nShe frowned down into the valley, a muscle on the side of her head\nconstantly working, and said nothing.\n“If we pull back, we leave the Dogman at Black Calder’s mercy. We\nhave to fight.”\nShe closed her eyes, her mouth a hard, flat line, and said nothing.\n“Mother.” He put one hand gently on her shoulder. “Wars may be won\nby the clever, but battles have to be fought by the brave. It’s time.”\nShe opened her eyes, and took a hard breath, and puffed it out. “Go,” she\nsaid.\nIt was as if that one soft word lit a fire in Leo’s belly and set his body\ntingling, from the roots of his hair to the tips of his toes. He felt a great\nsmile spread across his face as he turned. “Jurand!” he barked out, voice\nquivering with excitement. “We’re going in!”\nJurand sprang up. “Yes, sir!” And he hurried for his horse.\n“Leo?”\nHe turned back. His mother stood there against the grey sky, fists\nclenched tight.\n“Give those bastards hell,” she snarled.\n“Come on!” screamed Stour. He hadn’t bothered with a helmet, which\nseemed a prime slice of folly to Clover, but if men can’t see your face, how\ncan they tell everyone afterwards who did all the high deeds? “I want me\nthat bridge!” snarled the Great Wolf, wet hair plastered to his forehead and\nhis teeth bared as a wolf’s teeth should properly be. “That’s my fucking\nbridge!”\nIt was all quite the mess now. Stour’s Carls had only just held the Union\nat the foot of that red hill, their shield wall twisting back on itself and\nthreatening to burst. But they’d held them, and now there was a mad fight\nall along the valley, the bridge at one end the fiercest spot, Leo dan Brock’s\ngolden standard fluttering above the carnage. It was a temptation Stour\ncouldn’t ignore\n“Let me at that bastard!” He was near frothing at the mouth. “I’ll slit this\nYoung Lion from his fruits to his throat!”\nThat bridge really didn’t seem worth all the effort to Clover. If it hadn’t\nbeen for all the rain the last week, you could’ve just stepped around the\nbloody thing without getting your feet wet. He started to slow. Let Stour\nand his eager young stags charge on ahead. He’d fought enough battles. The\nfresh lads could claim their share of the action, and the costs, and the\nlessons."

He turned with a curse on his lips, but\ngrinned when he saw the culprit.\n“Magweer!” And with an even stormier look than usual. Like he’d\ncaught Clover fucking his mother rather than just snatching a breather.\n“Thought you’d be up front with the rest o’ the firebrands, pumping your\nname up with glory.”\n“Seems I’m needed here,” snarled Magweer, “making sure you fight,\nyou fucking old coward!”\n“A coward’s just a man with the proper respect for sharp metal,” said\nClover, waving him down. “A battle’s no place for a warrior.”\n“What the fuck?” spluttered Magweer, all his weapons rattling with\nupset.\n“No room to swing. More men killed by bad luck than good sword-\nwork. It’s all just shove and grunt, at the mercy of choices made miles away\nand hours before by men you’ll never meet. Your trouble is you’ve got\nyourself an idea about how life should be, but it’s just not how life is.”\nMagweer twisted his mouth open to spit some rejoinder, but Clover stopped\nhim by bending down to fish a spent flatbow bolt from the grass. Horrible-\nlooking thing, rain gleaming on its barbed head. “Let me show you what I\nmean. Imagine if one of these bastards fell on you.”\nMagweer’s voice had gone shrill with fury. “Wouldn’t be a battle\nwithout—” His eyes bulged as Clover caught his shoulder and rammed the\nbolt through his throat, so hard and so sudden the head punched right out of\nthe back of his neck.\nClover caught him as his knees went, lowering him gently. He glanced\nboth ways, but no one was looking. Man dying on a battlefield is hardly\nsuspicious, after all. Magweer fumbled for one of his many knives but\nClover caught his hand and held it tight. “I warned you.” He sadly shook\nhis head as Magweer stared up at him, blood bubbling from his nose. “A\nbattle’s a dangerous place.”\nClover grabbed a fistful of bloody mail and hauled Magweer over his\nshoulder, put on a look of shocked concern, then set off quick as he could\nfor the rear. Wasn’t all that quick, being honest. Been quite a while since he\nlast carried a man. After a few steps, he was puffing hard, specially with all\nMagweer’s weapons dangling about. Just goes to show, hardly matters how\nmany swords you carry if someone else strikes first.\nUp the muddy road he struggled, away from the bridge where the fight\nwas going harder than ever, away from the great shield wall that was\nstretching up the valley, past frowning Carls flooding the other way. More\nflatbow bolts flickered down from the high ground, peppered the grass.\nClover gritted his teeth and hefted Magweer up his shoulder, feeling the\nblood seeping warm through his shirt.

Kept on, past a pair of stretcher-bearers with\na wounded Thrall wailing between ’em. Kept on, like there was nothing\nmore important than saving this poor arrow-stuck lad on his back. By the\ndead, it was hard work, but he kept on, all the way up to that farm and its\ntree with the four bodies still swinging.\nThe wounded were laid out beside the house, groaning and mewling and\nsquealing for water, or mercy, or their mothers. All the things wounded folk\ntend to squeal for, they’re highly predictable in that regard. Songs about the\nglory of it all were thin on the ground right then and there. Clover wished\nhe could’ve shown this to Magweer while he was still alive. Maybe then\nhe’d have seen. But he doubted it. More often than not, men only see what\nthey want to.\nHe hefted Magweer off his shoulder and down onto the wet grass where\none of the healers was working, bloody to her elbows. She took a quick\nglance across. “He’s dead.”\nThat was no great revelation to Clover. When he chose to stab a man, he\naimed to do it in such a way that he’d never need another stabbing, and\npractice had made him very good at it. But he put on a show of sad surprise\neven so.\n“What a shame.” He planted hands on hips and shook his head at the\npointlessness of it all. “What a waste.”\nBut, you know. Nothing he hadn’t seen a hundred times before.\nHe stretched out his aching back, frowning at the way he’d come. Battle\nwas still going strong, misty through the falling rain, a great seething mass\nof bloodshed in the valley’s bottom.\n“Shit.” He wiped his sweaty forehead. “Daresay it’d all be over by the\ntime I got back down there.”\nThe healer didn’t answer. Busy tending to the next man in line, who’d a\nnasty-looking gash out of his shoulder, blood welling down his limp arm in\nstreaks.\nClover found a rock to sit on and set his sword beside it, still sheathed.\n“Probably best if I just stay up here.”\nSettle This Like Men\nL\neo wound the thong tight around his wrist, took a firm grip on the haft,\nthen turned to the riders behind him, rain pattering on their armour and the\nwet coats of their mounts. He lifted his axe high.\n“For the Union!” he bellowed, and there were nods and murmurs. “For\nthe king!” Not that anyone was too pleased with His August Majesty these\ndays. “For Angland!” Louder now, manly growls, angry calls, clenched\ngauntlets thumped on shields. “For your wives and your children!” He put a\nhand on Jurand’s shoulder and stood in his stirrups, trying to make them all\nfeel the same boiling anger, burning eagerness, seething joy he did. “For\nyour honour and your pride!” An answering cheer, smoking from helmets"

The men\nfound his name almost as inspiring as he did.\n“Forward!” And he slapped down his visor and dug in his heels.\nFirst at a walk, down the rutted track from the village, rain-pricked\npuddles shattered by his horse’s hooves. Barniva came level, and through\nthe open face of his helmet Leo could see his eager smile, that fashionable\nwar-weariness burned away in the fire of action. Leo smiled with him and\nurged his horse on. On, to the very point of the spear, where a leader\nbelonged.\nNow at a trot, Antaup bouncing up beside him couched low, Whitewater\nJin on the other side, red beard jutting. The valley came up grey through the\nrain ahead, the stream and the two hills, bouncing with the movement of\nLeo’s horse. Between them the bridge, men crowding onto it from both\nsides under a tangle of spears.\nHis smile grew wider. Jurand was beside him, and there was nothing he\ncouldn’t do. Finally, he was free of his shackles! He could take his fate in\nhis own hands. Carve out a place in the legends. The way Harod the Great\nhad done, or Casamir the Steadfast. The way the Bloody-Nine had done.\nNow at a jolting canter, the thunder of hooves as the best men in\nAngland followed, charging into battle. A battle ill-suited to horsemen,\nthough, it had to be admitted.\nThe Union forces were crumbling. They’d been forced back onto the\nnear bank of the stream and now they were starting to break, battle-weary\nmen running in panic, Carls screaming their war cries as they poured across\nthe bridge.\nLeo pounded heedless past the scattering Anglanders, fixed on one of the\npursuing Northmen. As he saw Leo bearing down, his yellow grin became a\ncircle of surprise. He turned, slipping and falling, hunter become prey. He\nwas still scrambling up when Leo’s axe caught him between the shoulders\nand flung him on his face.\nLeo gave a roar of triumph, heard Antaup’s shrill whoop over the\nhammering of hooves, over the wind through his visor. He swung at a Carl,\nmissed as the man threw himself aside, leaned over his saddle to chop down\nanother, sent him reeling into the mud.\nEverything simple. No grinding worry, no chafing frustration, no wasted\ndays slipping past. Only the beautiful, terrible now.\n“Forward!” he roared, pointlessly. Where else can charging cavalry go?\nSome Northern horsemen had forced their way across the bridge and he\nspurred his horse towards them, riding down a fleeing Carl who bounced\nfrom his horse’s flank and was crushed under the hooves of Barniva’s."

A lovely jolt up his arm as his axe glanced from a Northman’s helmet,\nmaking him reel in the saddle, thudded into his horse’s neck, spattering\nblood and making the beast totter sideways.\nLeo twisted the other way, his helmet hot with his own breath as he\nsnarled and spat and swore. He hacked at a shield, knocked it clear, hacked\nat the man who held it, ripped his shoulder open and hurled him from his\nsaddle, blood and mail rings flying, hacked at the leg left caught in the\nstirrups and chopped a great gash in it.\nA spear screeched down his shield and Leo caught the haft, wrestled\nwith it, slobbering meaningless curses. He reared up in his saddle, brought\nhis axe up and over in a great arc and smashed the spearman’s helmet right\nin with a hollow thud.\nHe swung sideways at a rider with silver rings in his beard, missed, got\ntangled with him, punched at him with his shield hand and snapped his head\nback. He lived for this! He lived for—\n“Gah!” His axe was stuck in something. “Bah!” Its bearded head caught\nin the straps of a saddle and it was pulling away, dragging him sideways.\n“Shit!” He struggled to twist his hand from the loop of the axe but he’d\nmade sure it was fast and he was dragged backwards, leg wrenched as his\nfoot was ripped from the stirrup. He tumbled down, the world reeling, took\na glancing blow on the helmet from a flailing hoof as a horse dropped\nbeside him.\nHe rolled, groggy, helmet full of drool. He crawled onto all fours, shook\nhis shield from his arm and fixed on the thong around his wrist, plucking at\nit, fingers clumsy in his gauntlets. Like trying to sew with mittens on.\nSomething made his ears ring—or were they ringing already?\nSuddenly his wrist tore free and he almost stumbled over backwards.\nThe rider with the silver in his beard was lying just next to him, mace in his\nhand, one leg caught under his horse.\n“Bastard!” he was snapping in Northern. “Bastard!” He swatted at Leo\nwith the mace but couldn’t hope to reach him. Leo stood, swaying. Mud\nshowered him as a horse thundered past. He realised his hands were empty.\nSword! Draw sword.\nHe pawed at the hilt, trying to shake the fuzz from his head. Faint scrape\nof steel as it slid from the scabbard. He stabbed at the rider, stumbled,\nmissed, point of the sword sliding into the mud beside him.\n“Bastard!” He hit Leo’s leg with his mace, but weakly. He hardly even\nfelt it.\nLeo was getting less dizzy. He aimed better this time, slid his sword\nthrough the man’s chest. He sat up and made a long fuffing sound. Fuff. All"

Damn thing must’ve got bent when the horse\nkicked him. His head was throbbing. Felt like he could hardly breathe. He\nfumbled the buckle open, dragged his helmet halfway around before he\ncould finally twist it off.\nThe chill wind hit his sweaty face like a slap and the world rushed at\nhim, the roar of battle furiously loud.\n“Leo!” Someone had him by the arm and he almost swung before he\nsaw it was Barniva, unhorsed and mud-smeared. Dead horses everywhere.\nDead men. Wounded men. Broken weapons. Leo wobbled down and clawed\nup a shield. A Carl’s round shield. Shoved his arm through the straps. A\nNorthman was crawling through the mud with a broken spear sticking from\nhis back. Leo chopped his head open.\n“Regroup!” he roared, hardly knowing who he was shouting at, hardly\nsure if there was anyone left to regroup except him and Barniva. It didn’t\nmatter. They could do it together. He could do it alone.\nThe rain was coming hard, fat drops pinging from his armour, soaking\ninto the padding beneath, turning it to cold lead. “To the bridge!” And he\nstarted to slog in the direction he thought it was, trusting that men were\nfollowing. He’d retreated for long enough.\nHe caught sight of his standard. The white field, the golden lion.\nHanging sodden at the near end of the bridge. And there was Stour\nNightfall’s. The slavering wolf on grey. Drooping in the rain at the far end.\nA lion fought a wolf in a circle of blood, and the lion won.\nLeo bared his teeth, squelching forward through mud battered and\nmashed by countless boots advancing and retreating, advancing and\nretreating. The fighting had been fiercest here. Bodies everywhere. Bodies\nfrom both sides. Men still and men still moving, crawling, crying, pawing at\nthe ground, pawing at themselves. Leo stepped between them, stepped over\nthem, teeth clenched, head throbbing, pushing on towards the bridge.\n“Leo!” Barniva grabbed him, dragged him down, shield across his face.\nSomething rattled from it. An arrow. Another bounced from Barniva’s\narmoured shoulder, more flickered into the grass. Someone fell, hands\nclapped to his throat. Leo peered over the rim of his shield, saw the archers,\nkneeling in a long row before the bridge, nocking arrows.\nBarniva sat down. “Lo,” he said, tongue strangely clumsy.\nThere was an arrow sticking out of his face. In the hollow between his\neye and the bridge of his nose. It looked ridiculous. Like a joke. Like a\nchild wedging his wooden sword between his arm and his ribs and standing\nsideways on. I’m stabbed! I’m stabbed!\nBut it was no joke. The white of Barniva’s eye had turned red.\nBloodstained."

Another rattled off\nLeo’s breastplate.\n“Fuckers!” he screeched, spraying spit. “Fuckers!” He caught his foot\nand went sliding on his face, took a mouthful of grass, near stabbing\nhimself with his own blade. He scrambled up and charged on, throwing his\nstolen shield away and lifting his sword in both hands.\nA glimpse of the stream, full of bobbing bodies. A glimpse of the archers\nas he clattered closer. Some old men. Some young men. One had a leather\nhood. One a shock of curly red hair. One’s face was bent sideways by some\nold wound. He saw Leo pounding towards him, faltered as he drew an\narrow from his quiver, let it fall, turning to run. The one with curly hair\nloosed a shaft from only a few strides away but he fumbled it in his panic\nand it went spinning high into the air.\nHe ducked gasping under Leo’s sword but Leo crashed into him with his\nshoulder, knocked him on his back, started hacking at the others, ears full of\ntheir squeals and gibbers and his own growls and the smashing and\ncracking of metal and flesh.\n“Die!” Glaward roared in his ear. “Die!”\nThe archers had no armour and Leo’s sword thudded into them like a\nbutcher’s cleaver into meat, opening great spitting and spurting wounds.\nOne man fell screaming with his side laid right open. Leo broke a man’s\nbow as he tried to block his sword with it and took his arm off, too, tottered\npast all off balance, bounced off Antaup as he stabbed a man on the ground\nwith his spear. He fell, rolled, saw an archer with a knife ready to spring on\nhim, lifted a clumsy arm to fend him off, then he was smashed out of the\nway by a great mace. Whitewater Jin, and he grabbed Leo’s wrist and\ndragged him up.\nThe archers were running, being hacked down, floundering into the\nstream, and Leo wobbled on towards the bridge.\nA man was stumbling away, clutching at his shoulder, blood bubbling\nbetween his fingers, and Leo hit him across the side of the head with his\nsword, caught him with the flat and knocked him sprawling, trampled over\nhim."

Every step was a\nmountain.\nOnto the bridge. He could feel the stones slippery with mud and blood,\nslick with the falling rain.\nThere were Carls here, desperately trying to organise a shield wall. A\nNamed Man with a fox-fur around his shoulders pointed with a thick finger.\nLeo didn’t so much charge at him as fall onto him, his weary swing\nclattering harmlessly off the Named Man’s shield. He caught his chin on the\nrim, mouth filling with the salt taste of blood.\nThe Northman lurched back a pace but didn’t fall, and they twisted into\nan awkward, exhausted embrace, shuffling, snarling, wrestling, shouldering\nand elbowing while armoured men clobbered away at each other around\nthem.\nLeo heard the Northman’s desperate, whistling breath in his ear, grunted\nand clawed at him, wet fur in his mouth. His sword was tangled with\nsomething, couldn’t move it. He managed to draw his dagger with his other\nhand, stabbed, but the blade only scraped uselessly on mail. No room. No\nbreath. No strength, the dagger twisted from his grip, fell in the mud.\nThey lumbered about in a pawing circle, bounced off the bridge’s\nparapet, enough room for Leo to force his free hand up under the man’s\nchin, push his gauntleted thumb into his mouth, shove it through so he\ncaught a fistful of his cheek, ripping his lip open, tearing his face open, and\nthe man screamed and grabbed Leo’s wrist, letting Leo’s sword loose. With\na last growling effort, Leo shoved him away, smashed him on the side of the\nhead, flinched as blood spotted his face, something bouncing off his cheek.\nA tooth, maybe. The man went reeling over the mossy parapet and splashed\ninto the stream with the other corpses. Bloody thing was more corpse than\nriver now. No corpses, no glory.\nLeo flopped down on all fours, clawed up his sword along with a fistful\nof mud. Up to one knee, with a groan to his feet and he stood swaying,\ngrasping at the slick stones, every muscle throbbing, dragging in air in great\nwheezing gasps, like a fish hooked and hauled helpless from the river.\n“Have… to pull back.” It was Jurand, with hardly the breath to talk.\nHelmet off and his face spotted with blood. He hugged Leo, half holding\nhim up, half leaning on him. “Get you to safety.”\n“No,” growled Leo, gripping him tight, their wet armour scraping, then\ntrying to struggle free, to press on. “We fight.”\nThe rain was hammering down, pinging and spattering.

And at the far end, beneath that wolf standard, more\nNorthmen were gathered.\nA group as muddy, bloody and sodden as Leo, teeth bared with hate but\nweapons drooping from weariness. They faced each other across the rain-\ndrenched bridge, Leo and his friends at one end, this knot of Named Men at\nthe other, and in their midst a tall man, long hair plastered to his snarling\nface by the rain.\n“Leo dan Brock!” he shrieked, wet eyes wild with battle-madness, and\nLeo knew from the gold on his sword and the gold on his belt and the gold\non his armour who he had to be.\n“Stour Nightfall!” Leo roared back, spit flying from his bared teeth. He\ntried to drag himself forward but Jurand held him back, or maybe held him\nup, it was only fury stopped Leo’s knees from buckling.\n“We won’t settle this on the field!” snarled Nightfall.\nThat was true enough. They were all fought out. Up on the red hill,\nvague through the rain, the Union were pulling back, but Stour’s men were\nin no shape to follow and the rain had turned the battlefield to glue.\nStour fought free of his warriors and stood tall, pointing across the\nbridge with his blood-slathered sword. “Let’s settle it like men! In the\nCircle! You and me!”\nLeo hardly even gave a shit about the terms. All he wanted was to fight\nthis bastard. To rip him apart with his bare hands. To bite him with his teeth.\nA lion fought a wolf in a circle of blood, and the lion won.\n“In the Circle!” he bellowed into the rain. “You and me!”\nPART III\n“Love turns, with a little indulgence, to indifference or disgust;\nhatred alone is immortal.”\nWilliam Hazlitt\nDemands\nF\norest stepped into the room wearing his hallmark fur hat and ruggedly\ngrave expression. The hat he removed. The grave expression he kept in\nplace. “The Breakers should be here soon, Your Highness.”\n“Good,” murmured Orso. “Good.” He expressed the exact opposite of\nhis feelings so often, one might have hoped he would be better at it. In fact,\nthe thought of the Breakers’ arrival left him desperately wanting a drink.\nBut dawn was probably considered too early at a peace negotiation, even\nfor a small beer or something. He puffed out a worried sigh.\nA local worthy had offered up his dining room as the venue, and though\nthe table was highly polished, Orso found the chairs exceedingly\nuncomfortable. Or perhaps he simply found himself uncomfortable in the\nrole of negotiator. Or any responsible role, really. He nervously straightened\nhis jacket for the thousandth time. It had fit him perfectly in the safety of\nAdua, but suddenly it was tight about the throat. He leaned towards\nSuperior Pike with an apologetic smile.\n“I think it might be useful if, when they arrive… you were to play the\nvillain?”\nPike subjected Orso to that withering stare. “Because of my hideous\nburns?”\n“That and all the black.”\nThe faint twisting of Pike’s face might almost have been a smile. “Don’t"

Feel free to slap\nme down if I become too dastardly. I look forward to seeing you as the hero\nof our little piece.”\n“I hope I can convince,” murmured Orso, tugging his jacket smooth yet\nagain. “I fear I missed all the rehearsals.”\nThe double doors swung open and the Breakers strode in. Orso’s ever-\nfertile imagination had built them up into red-handed zealots. In the flesh,\nthey were a slightly disappointingly, then perhaps a rather reassuringly,\nordinary group.\nIn the lead came a weighty old man: brawny shoulders, broad hands,\nheavy-lidded eyes that settled on Orso and stayed there, immovable. Next\ncame a fellow with a scarred face whose eyes settled on nothing, darting\ntwitchily around the room to windows, doors, the half-dozen guards about\nthe panelled walls, meeting no one’s eye. Finally, there was a woman with a\nstained coat and an unkempt shag of lank hair, one of the hardest frowns\nOrso ever saw showing beneath. The look of implacable scorn in her blue\neyes actually reminded him more than a little of his mother.\n“Welcome!” He aimed at a balance between warm indulgence and\neffortless authority, but no doubt ended up with prickly weakness. “I am\nCrown Prince Orso, this is Colonel Forest, commander of the four\nregiments currently encircling Valbeck, and this—”\n“We’ve all heard of Superior Pike,” said the old man, dropping heavily\ninto the middle chair and frowning across the table.\n“Only good things, I hope,” whispered Pike, oozing menace. Orso felt\nthe hairs on his neck bristling even though he sat on the same side. When it\ncame to playing the villain, he was clearly in the presence of a virtuoso.\n“My name is Malmer.” The old Breaker’s voice was as weighty as his\nframe, each word placed as carefully as a master mason fits his stones.\n“This is Brother Heron, fought a dozen years in your father’s armies.” He\nnodded towards the scar-faced man, then to the hard-faced woman, who\nappeared to be reaching greater heights of epic contempt with every breath\nOrso took. “This is Sister Teufel, spent a dozen years in your father’s prison\ncamps.”\n“Charmed?” ventured Orso, more in hope than expectation, but Pike was\nalready sitting forward, lips curling back.\n“You will address the Crown Prince of the Union as your—”\n“Please!” Orso held up a calming hand and made Pike sit back like a\nhound called off. “No one will die because of a defect of etiquette. It is my\nardent hope that no one will die at all. I understand… hostages have been\ntaken?”\n“Five hundred and forty-eight at the last count,” grated out the woman,\nTeufel, as if delivering a mortal insult to a lifelong enemy.\n“But we’d like nothing better than to see ’em released,” said Malmer."

He had to bite down on it. Had to stop following his cock from one\ndisaster to another and use his head for once. “In which case you could\nsimply release them?” he ventured.\nMalmer gave a sad smile, leathery skin creasing about his eyes. “I’m\nafraid we’ve got some demands first.”\n“The Crown does not negotiate with traitors,” grated out Pike.\n“Please, gentlemen, please.” Orso held up that calming hand again. “Let\nus set the blame aside and concentrate on a resolution that gives everyone\nsome of what they want.” He was surprised by how well that came out.\nPerhaps he wasn’t so bad at this after all. “By all means, present your\ndemands—”\nHis satisfaction was quickly cut off as Teufel flung a folded paper so it\nspun across the polished table and into his lap. He winced as he unfolded it,\nexpecting insults scrawled in blood.\nBut there was only small, neat writing in a tightly controlled hand.\nShow no surprise. Pretend you are looking at a list of demands. In\nspite of appearances, I am your friend.\nCaught off guard, Orso glanced up at the woman. She glared back at him\neven more angrily than before, hard lines forming between her brows.\n“You can read, can’t you, Your Highness?” she sneered.\n“I must have worn out a dozen tutors, but my mother was most insistent\nthat I learn.” Orso frowned down at the paper, trying to look like a man\nbaffled by what he saw there. It required no great effort of acting on his\npart.\nSuperior Risinau was the prime instigator of the uprising but fled the\ncity before you arrived, along with the Burners, who caused most of\nthe death and damage. Malmer is in charge now, if anyone is. He is\nnot a bad man. He does not wish to see the hostages hurt. His main\nconcern is for the safety of civilians, and for the Breakers and their\nfamilies. He has demands but he is becoming desperate. Food is\nscarce and order is collapsing.\nThis information was, to say the least, as useful as it was unexpected, but\nOrso kept his face carefully blank. He acted as if he had drawn a winning\nhand at the gaming table, and now had only to drag the biggest bets possible\nfrom the other players.\nMalmer knows he has little left to bargain with. Offer him too much\nand he will become suspicious. He feared you would attack at once.\nNow he fears you will surround the city and starve the Breakers out.\nHe expects you to be an arrogant liar. My advice is to treat him with\nhonesty and respect. To seek a peaceful solution and avoid bluster.\nBut to firmly refuse any demands and make him aware that you know\ntime is on your side. If you were to offer amnesty for the Breakers, I\nbelieve he could be persuaded to surrender. He knows that is more\nthan he could hope for."

He knows that is more\nthan he could hope for.\nThe Breakers’ demands were laid out next: changes to labour laws, controls\non wages and the price of bread, sanitation and housing, things Orso\nscarcely understood, let alone could grant.\nSuperior Pike held out his melted glove of a hand. “May I, Your—”\n“You may not.” Orso folded the paper, sharpened the crease in it with\nhis thumbnail and slipped it inside his jacket.\nThen he smiled—always begin with a smile—and he leaned towards\nMalmer as though sharing a confidence with an old friend. As though the\nfates of thousands in no way hinged on their coming to an agreement.\n“Master Malmer, I judge you to be an honest man, and I want to be\nhonest in return. It would be easy for me to offer you the world, but I do not\nwish to insult you. The truth is, the Closed Council is in no mood to\nnegotiate and, even if I agreed to all your demands…” He spread his hands\nin the same gesture of cavalier helplessness he used with jilted lovers,\nfrustrated creditors and outraged officers of the law. “I’m the crown prince.\nThere would be nothing to stop my father or his advisors refusing to honour\nmy promises. I suspect, frankly, that’s the very reason they sent me. And I\nsuspect, frankly… you’re well aware of that.”\n“Then why are we even here?” snapped Heron.\nForest had managed to crank his scarred face a notch graver. “Troops\nstand ready to move into the city at your order, Your Highness—”\n“The very last thing we want is further bloodshed, Colonel Forest,” said\nOrso, giving him the calming palm now. He had enough calming palm for\neveryone. “We are all citizens of the Union. We are all subjects of my\nfather. I refuse to believe we cannot find a peaceful solution.”\nHe might not have spent much time negotiating for hostages, but at\nconvincing people he could be trusted, whether in a gaming hall, a lady’s\nbedroom or a moneylender’s shop, he had almost bottomless experience to\ndraw on. He softened his voice, he softened his face, he softened\neverything. He held Malmer’s eye and made himself all syrupy sympathy.\n“I am aware that the author of this unfortunate situation… was Superior\nRisinau. I note that he has not come forward to negotiate, however. Perhaps\nas the danger grew, his commitment to his own cause shrivelled?” Did Orso\ndetect the slightest twitch on Malmer’s stony face? “I know that type of\nman. Let us be honest, I have often seen him in the mirror. A man who\nmakes a mess and leaves others to mop up.”\nNobody leaped to his defence, which was disappointing, but nor did they\nleap to Risinau’s.\n“I understand what it’s like…” he gave his three opponents each a\nsympathetic look, “to be left with the blame. I appreciate that those of you\nstill in the city are those who chose to stay and try to salvage the situation.\nThe authors of this disaster will be tracked down and punished, of that I\nassure you.”"

All of them, regardless of where their loyalties may\nhave lain. I can bring your demands to my father. I can relay your demands\nto the Closed Council. But, in the end, you and I both know I cannot\npromise to meet them.” Orso took a long breath and gave a long sigh. “I\ncan, however… promise you amnesty. A full pardon to every Breaker who\nsurrenders themselves and their weapons by sunset tomorrow, along with all\nyour hostages, unharmed. Supplies of food will then immediately be\nallowed into the city.”\n“Your Highness,” broke in Pike. “We cannot allow traitors to—”\nOrso silenced him with that raised hand, without taking his eyes from\nMalmer’s. “I fear the alternative is that I order Colonel Forest to surround\nthe city and let nothing in or out. I have quite cleared my calendar and can\nwait as long as it takes. When you surrender, which you surely must, it will\nnot be to me, but to Superior Pike.”\nIt hardly needed to be said that there was no comfort to be found in the\nSuperior’s melted face. Malmer slowly sat back and gave Orso weighty\nconsideration. “Why should we trust you?”\n“I can understand why you wouldn’t. But in light of the circumstances, I\nbelieve this to be a generous offer. I know it to be the very best you can\nhope for.”\nMalmer glanced at Heron. Then at Teufel. Neither gave anything away.\n“I’ll need to discuss it with my people.”\n“Of course,” said Orso, standing. He offered his hand as Malmer got to\nhis feet. The old Breaker frowned at it for a moment, then folded it in his\nbig paw.\nOrso held on firmly. “But I must insist on an answer by sundown today.”\n“You’ll have it.” Malmer considered him a moment longer. “Your\nHighness.” He strode weightily from the room, his twitchy friend at his\nback. Teufel’s chair screeched on the tiled floor as she stood, gave Orso one\nlast blast of scorn, then turned her back on the meeting. The door clicked\nshut.\n“That was well done, Your Highness.” There was the faintest suggestion\nof surprise about Superior Pike’s hairless brows, and who could blame him?\nOrso had been diligently fostering low expectations for the past decade.\n“Quite masterfully done.”\n“I must confess, I had considerable help.” Orso fished the list of\ndemands from his jacket. “From the woman with the face like a pickaxe.”\nPike blinked down at Orso’s entire negotiating strategy, arranged in\ncareful blocks of neat writing. “She must be the Arch Lector’s agent within\nthe city.”\n“I cannot see another explanation. It appears she has worked her way\ninto a position of some trust among the Breakers.”\n“Impressive.” Pike frowned towards the door. “A great deal now hangs\non her assessment.”"

Alone in the city. A hostage? A corpse? He grimaced. He had a\nbastard of a headache coming up behind the eyes.\nPerhaps it wasn’t too early for that drink after all.\nTaking the Reins\nR\nikke’s nose tingled with the chill before dawn, and the breath of the\nwounded men made plumes of smoke.\nShe wondered how many were laid out in that glade. Maybe a hundred.\nMaybe more. Hunched and bloodstained healers moved among them,\nstitching, bandaging, setting, giving food and water and what comfort they\ncould. It wasn’t much.\nThere was a low drone, like one of those flowering bushes the bees can’t\nleave alone, but made of murmurs, whimpers, groans and sobs. A chorus of\npain. Quite the downer, all told. Rikke shivered and pulled the fur tight\naround her neck with her free hand.\n“Hold it higher, I said.”\n“Sorry.” Her shoulder ached as she lifted the torch again so Isern could\nsee her business, tongue tip wedged into the gap in her teeth as she stitched\nthe red wound in a boy’s shoulder. He had a stick to bite on, eyes closed and\ntear-tracks gleaming on his pink cheeks.\n“Never really thought of you as a healer,” said Rikke, wincing as Isern\nsponged blood away with a rag.\n“No?”\n“Didn’t think you’d be gentle enough.”\n“Gentle? Ha! If you’re wounded, a gentle healer’s the last thing you\nwant.” Isern made the boy gurgle as she dug the needle back into his\nshoulder. “If you’re wounded, a gentle healer could be the last thing you\nget. A great healer needs to be tougher and more ruthless than a great\nwarrior. They’re taking on a far harder job with far less reward.”\nOne of the other healers grunted agreement around the little knife she\nwas holding in her teeth.\nIsern gave Rikke a significant look from under her brows. “A great\nhealer, like a great leader, must make of her heart a stone.”\nThe lad Isern was working on pulled the spit-slathered stick out of his\nmouth. “For the dead’s sake, don’t distract her.”\n“I can stitch you and talk to her at once, boy.” And Isern plucked the\nstick from his hand, shoved it back between his jaws and carried on\nstitching.\nRikke looked wide-eyed across the groaning glade. “So many\nwounded.”\n“And these are the best-looking ones. The ones who might yet get up.”\n“You wonder why they keep doing it.”\n“What, war?”\n“Aye, war.”\n“Maybe they wouldn’t if all the Named Men came down here to have\ntheir faces rubbed in what’s growed from what they’ve sowed, but they\ndon’t come down here, do they?

Not\nmuch shiny metal, except the bits we dig out o’ the dying men. Women’s\nwork, isn’t it, healing?”\nSounded a touch hypocritical in Isern’s case, since Rikke had seen her\nkill at least five men with that spear of hers, but as a general principle it was\nhard to disagree. “They break,” she murmured, “we make.”\nIsern shook her head, lips pressed into a hard line as she nimbly worked\nthat needle. “All the effort it takes to make a person but it’s the killers they\nsing about. When did you last hear a man sing a woman’s name? Unless he\nwas singing for his mummy when the Great Leveller had a hand on him.”\n“No doubt there’s many ways in which the world could be better,” said\nRikke, with a smoky sigh.\n“My heartfelt thanks for that revelation,” said Isern, rolling a scornful\neye towards her. “The one thing I’ve learned in thirty-six winters is the\nworld won’t change itself. You want some wounds mended, you’d better be\nready to stitch.”\nRikke felt even more than usually helpless in the midst of all this pain.\n“What can I do?”\n“You? Rikke, with the Long Eye? Saw Black Calder’s men coming,\ndidn’t you? Saved the army, maybe. Saved us all, maybe.”\n“Maybe.” It was true folk were looking at her different since the battle.\nLike they respected her, which was a pleasant change. Like they feared her,\nwhich was less so. Like they hated her, a couple of ’em, which oddly was\nunpleasant and pleasant both at once. She’d never thought she’d be\nimportant enough to hate.\n“You’re not nobody any more, Sticky Rikke.” Isern opened her eyes\nvery wide. “The legend grows.”\n“Legend.” Rikke snorted. “I’m nothing and no one.”\n“Ah, but isn’t that how all the best legends begin? I’d hazard you’re\nbetter equipped to lead us to a brighter tomorrow than most.”\n“I’m no bloody leader.”\n“How could you be, shuffling along at the back whining about how\nuseless y’are? Hold that torch higher.”\n“Sorry. You’ll have to find someone else to hold it soon. I’ve been called\nto a meeting at dawn.” Rikke puffed herself up. “By Lady Governor Brock,\nin fact.”\n“Wants to use your womanly wiles to convince her son not to fight, does\nshe?”\nRikke sagged back down. “If she’s counting on my womanly wiles, she\nmust be bloody desperate.”\n“Oh, I reckon you’ve more wiles than you realise. Talked the boy into\nfighting in the first place, didn’t you?” And Isern gave her this sidewise\nglance, like they were in on some cunning scheme together.\n“What?”\n“With your lions and wolves and circles of blood.”\n“That’s just what I saw, in the vision. You asked me what I saw!”\nIsern paused in her work. “You can’t choose what you see. But you can"

Moment ago, you were talking about changing the\nworld. Now you can’t even change one boy’s mind? Let’s face the facts, it’s\nnot the biggest mind around.” She tore the thread with her teeth and reached\nfor the bandages. “I know you like to think you’re jolting about helpless in\na runaway cart, carried off to who-knows-where with no say in the matter,\nbut if you look down, you might see you’re holding the reins.” She gave\nRikke another one of those looks. “Might be it’s time to use ’em. Now hold\nthat bloody torch up.”\nThe Young Lion never looked bad, but being angry suited him, and being\nbattle-scratched suited him, and even being a touch sulky seemed to suit\nhim. Overall, Rikke was having some trouble imagining a better-looking\nman.\nThe trouble is that duels to the death aren’t always won by the best-\nlooking. If anything, history favours ugly champions. Maybe they spend the\ntime training that the pretty ones spend preening in the mirror. Rikke kept\nthat thought to herself, though, since everyone was rattled enough already.\nLeo had staked all their futures on a duel with one of the most dangerous\nmen in the North, after all, and about the only person who didn’t reckon that\nthe worst idea since swords made of cake was Leo himself, known widely\nfor his poor judgement.\nRikke’s mood was by no means helped by the knight herald standing\nmotionless in the middle of the tent, a letter from His August Majesty held\nout in one gauntleted fist. When she’d slipped through the flap and seen him\nstanding there, she’d wondered where they found all these tall bastards.\nThen she’d wondered why everyone else was ignoring him. Then, during a\nparticularly impassioned rant, the lady governor had walked right through\nhim and back the other way, and Rikke had realised her left eye was hot and\nhe wasn’t actually there. Or wasn’t there yet, maybe.\nWhen she’d seen Black Calder coming, she’d started to reckon the Long\nEye a blessing. Now it was looking like a curse all over again.\n“I can’t back out,” Leo was saying, all sullen and scratched and\nbeautiful. “What’ll I look like?”\nHis mother stared in disbelief. She’d been doing that a lot. “There are\nbigger things at stake than what you look like!”\nRikke’s father took a turn, easing himself between the two of them,\nputting a calming hand on Leo’s shoulder. “Look, son, it’s an irony of life\nthat the older you get, and the less years there are ahead of you, the more\nyou fear the loss of ’em. When you’re young, it can feel like you’re\ninvincible, but…” He snapped his fingers under Leo’s nose. “Fast as that, it\ncan all be took away.”\n“I know that!” said Leo. “It was your stories of the Bloody-Nine that\nmade me fascinated by duels in the first place! All his great victories in the\nCircle. The fate of the North hanging on a single—”"

The fate of the North hanging on a single—”\nRikke’s father looked horrified. “Those were supposed to be warnings,\nboy, not encouragements!”\n“Has it occurred to either of you that I might bloody win?” Leo angrily\nbunched one scabbed fist. “We’re fought out! We’ve no help coming and\nScale Ironhand has fresh men ready! This might be our only chance to take\nback Uffrith. To keep the Protectorate alive!”\nRikke’s father folded his arms, and puffed up a slow sigh, and glanced at\nLeo’s mother from under his bushy brows. “Can’t deny he’s got a point.”\n“I can win!” Leo came to stand right next to the frozen knight herald, the\nbig seal on the scroll that wasn’t there almost touching his face. “I know I\ncan! Rikke saw it!”\nRikke’s father and Leo’s mother turned together to look at her. She stood\nfrozen, mouth and eyes wide open like a burglar caught with her hand in a\npurse.\nAnd it came to her then that Isern had been right. What she’d seen was\none thing but what she said another, and there needn’t be a straight road\nbetween the two, but any kind of maze she chose to put there. Sorry, Leo, I\nmade a mistake. Sorry, Leo, your mother’s right. Sorry, Leo, actually the\nlion lost, and got his fruits ripped off and stuck on a pike.\nMight be she was holding the reins after all. Might be she always had\nbeen. Might be she’d done this, and could undo it.\nBut somewhere at the back of her mind, in a dark corner she’d hardly\nknown she had, she found she wanted to see Leo fight Stour Nightfall. To\nsee him spill that evil bastard’s blood in front of the whole North. To take\nher share of vengeance, for her father, for those wounded in the glade, for\nthe dead already in the mud, for the shit she’d gone through out in the cold\nwoods.\nShe could’ve said anything. She chose to tell the truth.\n“I saw a lion and a wolf fight in a circle of blood, and the lion won.”\nLeo’s mother pressed her fingers to her temples. “So you are going to\nrisk your life, not to mention the future of the North, because this girl saw\nanimals fighting while she had a fit?”\n“She saw the Nail come from the woods before it happened,” said\nRikke’s father, forced against his better judgement into defending her.\n“Weren’t for that, we might all be in the mud already.”\n“For pity’s sake, Rikke!” shouted Finree. “You’re no fool! Tell him this\nis madness!”\n“Well…” Rikke frowned at jingling footsteps outside, spurs on\narmoured boots, and she rolled her eyes up to the tent’s ceiling. “Ahhhhh. I\nget it.”\n“Get what?”\n“Hardly matters what I think. Or you.”\n“Might I ask why?”\nRikke nodded towards the tent flap. “Because of him.”\nIt was swept open with a swirling of cloth and the knight herald stomped\ninto the tent.

He pulled the scroll from his satchel and stepped forward,\ncoming to stand just exactly where he’d been standing the whole time,\nscroll offered out to Leo, great seal dangling.\n“My Lord Brock,” he said. “A message from the king.”\nThere was a breathless stillness in the tent as Leo took the scroll and\nslowly unrolled it. He read the first few lines and looked up, eyes wide.\n“The king confirms me in my father’s place as Lord Governor of\nAngland.”\nRikke’s father let go a long, slow breath. Leo’s mother took a half-step\nforwards.\n“Leo—”\n“No,” he said. Not sharp, but very firm. “I know you want what’s best\nfor me, Mother. I’m grateful for all you’ve taught me. But I have to stand\non my own now. I’m fighting Stour Nightfall. Nothing anyone can say will\nchange my mind.”\nAnd he turned and pushed his way out of the tent.\nThe knight herald nodded, somewhat sheepishly, to Lady Finree, then\nfollowed the new Lord Governor of Angland, thankfully taking his ghost\nwith him.\nRikke’s father rubbed wearily at his stubbled jaw. “Well. We tried.” And\nhe patted Rikke on the shoulder and made his own way out.\nLady Finree was left staring towards the flap. A few moments ago, she’d\nbeen in total command. With a stroke of the king’s pen, she was cut down to\nsome warrior’s worried mother.\n“It feels like yesterday I was feeding him, and dressing him, and wiping\nhis arse.” She looked at Rikke, voice turning harsh. “He’s a bloody idiot\nwho knows nothing about anything, but he was born with a cock, so he gets\nto decide for all of us!”\nShe looked old, of a sudden, and weak, and helpless, and Rikke felt\nsorry for her, and sorry for what she’d done, but there was no undoing it.\nYou might see the past with the Long Eye. But you can never go there.\nShe shrugged so high her shoulders were tickling her ears, then let them\nflop helplessly down. “Maybe he’ll win?”\nA Fool’s Weapon\n“T\nhe bloody fool!” snarled Calder, stalking through the village.\n“Aye.” Clover sighed as he followed. “Bloody fool.”\nThe muddy place was crawling with Scale’s warriors, men armed and\nangry and used never to backing down. They soon scrambled aside, though,\nwhen they saw Black Calder coming with a face like thunder.\n“I loved my wife, Clover,” he growled. “Loved her more than my own\nlife.”\n“Well… that’s a good thing, I guess?”\n“That was my great weakness.”\n“Ah.”\n“I loved her, and she died, and all that was left of her was our son.”\n“Oh.”\nCalder strode on towards the chieftain’s hall the King of the Northmen\nhad made into his temporary tavern. “So I indulged him, and I spoiled him,\nand on the many occasions when I should’ve given the bloody fool the"

What else would he be doing? He was\ndrinking, and laughing lustily at stories of the battle, already bloating out\nwith lies like so much watered beer. His nephew, the mighty Stour\nNightfall, decorated with a few fresh cuts and bruises, grinned to hear of his\nown exploits, even more at the falsehoods than the facts. About these two\nheroes, old warriors and young basked in the sunny radiance of a victory\nthey hadn’t won yet.\nThey fell silent as Calder strode in, carrying no weapon but with his face\nsharp as a drawn sword. “Get. Out.”\nThe old cunts and the young bristled, grumbled, looked to their\nrespective masters, and Scale puffed his vein-threaded cheeks and gestured\nto the door. Up they got, out they filed, giving Clover his usual serving of\nscorn while he beamed back his usual good humour. The doors were shut on\ntheir performance, leaving only four in the room. King Scale Ironhand, his\nbrother Black Calder, his son Stour Nightfall. And Clover.\nQuite the party.\n“My loving family, all together!” sang Calder in a voice rich with scorn.\nStour was all preening dismissal. “Father—”\n“Don’t ‘Father’ me, boy! You approve of this madness, do you, Scale?”\n“We’re at war, brother.” The King of the Northmen looked calmly at\nCalder from under his grey-streaked brows. “And in war, yes, I approve of\nwarriors fighting.”\n“It’s how they fight and when that’s the issue! You’d put all our gains at\nrisk! All our work!” Meaning all Calder’s work, since Scale had done\nnothing but drink at the back and Stour nothing but strut at the front.\n“You’re our future, Stour! The future of the North! We can’t risk you—”\n“You said the same when I fought Stranger-Come-Knocking!” Stour\nwaved his father away like a cobweb. “He’s too dangerous, we can’t risk\nyou, you’re all our futures.” He put on a parroting whine which was, to be\nfair, not too bad a match for Calder’s prating. “But I beat him! Like the\nBloody-Nine beat Shama Heartless, when no one said he could!” And his\nchest puffed and his eyes twinkled, like a cock that spies another in his\nyard. “This Union child isn’t half the warrior Stranger-Come-Knocking\nwas! Not one quarter!”\n“The Young Lion, they call him, and my spies tell me he’s formidable.\nHow often have I said to you—never fear your enemy, but always respect\nhim?

Flatstone can come around on the\nflank and the ground is—”\n“Enough strategy.” Scale wrinkled his nose as if the word smelled.\n“Back in winter, you told me the war would be won in spring. In spring,\nyou told me it would be won in summer. In summer, by autumn. Last week,\nyou told me the war was won now. That you’d out-thought that Union bitch\nand outfought the Dogman. Seems the Union bitch is a sharper thinker and\nthe Dogman a tougher fighter than you reckoned. What if you misjudge ’em\nagain, and you can’t finish ’em before the weather turns, and the sluggardly\nKing of the Union wakes up and sends help? What then?”\nCalder angrily waved it away. “If help was coming from Midderland, it\nwould’ve come already. We can still finish them before winter.”\n“Don’t worry,” said Stour. “I can finish ’em before sunset tomorrow.”\nAnd he laughed, and Scale laughed, and Calder very decidedly didn’t, and\nClover watched ’em, thinking this was no great way to run a kingdom. “The\nBloody-Nine never backed out of a fight, nor Black Dow, nor Whirrun of\nBligh, and nor will I.”\n“You’ve made a list of dead fools,” hissed Calder, near tearing his hair.\n“Tell him, Clover, for the sake of the dead, tell him!”\nClover had been telling Stour for near half a year and made no mark,\nlike shooting a quiver full of daffodils at a man in full plate armour. But one\nmore daffodil could do no harm. He spread his hands as if he held out a\nplatter covered in fine advice. “There’s no bigger foolishness than to choose\nto face a dangerous man on equal terms. Look at me. Lost everything in the\nCircle.”\nStour’s lip curled. “Your fruits, too?”\n“They’re still there, my prince, if a little shrivelled. But I don’t think\nwith ’em any more.”\n“My nephew beat Stranger-Come-Knocking in the Circle,” said the\nking, blowing some froth from his ale. “He can beat some Union fool.”\n“Who was it took your hand, brother?” said Calder. “Some Union fool,\nas I recall?”\nScale didn’t anger, just smiled to show his missing front teeth. “You’re\nwise, brother. You’re cunning. Just like our father. What I have I owe to\nyour wits and your ruthlessness and your loyalty, I know that. There are\nmany things you understand far better than me. But you’re no fighter.”\nCalder’s lip curled with contempt. “You haven’t fought a man in twenty\nyears! You only want to watch him fight so you can relive your lost glories.\nYou’re fat as a—”\n“Yes, I’m fat as a hog and twenty years past my best and I daresay quite\nthe figure of fun for most. But there is one thing you’re forgetting, brother.”\nScale hooked his thumb under his golden chain and lifted it so the great\ndiamond dangled, sparkling with the flames in the firepit. “I am our father’s"

I am king!” He let the chain fall, and slapped\nhis good hand down on Stour’s shoulder. “I name Stour Nightfall not only\nas my heir but as my champion. He’ll stand for me in the Circle, and fight\nfor Uffrith and all the land between the Cusk and the Whiteflow. That’s the\nend of it.”\nStour broke out that wet-eyed grin of his. “Perhaps you should leave the\nwarriors to their talk, Father. We’ve the choice of weapons to discuss.”\nCalder stood quiet a moment longer, face a rigid mask. “Warriors,” he\nhissed, like it was the worst insult he could think of, then turned on his heel\nand stalked from the room.\nStour lifted his ale cup. “By the dead, when the mood’s on him, he can\nbleat like a fucking sheep—”\nThere was a sharp crack as Scale slapped him, knocking the cup from\nhis hand and sending it spinning across the floor. “You’d be wise to treat\nyour father with respect, boy!” snarled the king, his great finger shoved in\nStour’s shocked and pinking face. “Everything you have you owe to him!”\nThere was a long silence, then Scale gave the golden pommel of the heavy\nsword he wore a fond pat. “Call me old-fashioned, but I still favour a\nsword. What do you say, Clover?”\n“I say a sword’s a fool’s weapon.”\nStour was rubbing his face with his fingertips, looking at his uncle\nthrough narrowed eyes. Now he turned them on Clover. “You carry one.”\n“I do.” Clover picked at his own battered pommel with a fingernail. “But\nI try never to draw it.”\nScale threw up his hands, the iron and the flesh. “You make your living\nteaching other folk to use one!”\n“They pay me to learn. But I always start by telling ’em never to fight\nwith one. Come at a man with a sword, he’ll see you coming, and if a man\nyou mean to kill sees you coming then you’re going about it all wrong.”\n“There’s no hiding in the Circle.” Stour turned away from Clover in\ndisgust. “In the Circle, the other man’s always ready.”\n“That’s why I’d stay even further from the Circle than I would from the\nsword,” said Clover. “Money, land, fame, friends, even your name—lose\nthem but keep your life, with time and hard labour you can always win ’em\nback.” He’d lost his name, hadn’t he? And won a new? He could still smell\nthe sweet clover in his nose as he lay there in the Circle, waiting for the\nend. “But there’s no beating the Great Leveller. No man comes back from\nthe mud.”\nStour gave a hiss of disgust. “Fucking coward’s words.”\n“A live coward can find his courage another day. A dead hero…” Clover\nliked to talk, but sometimes silence says more. He let it stretch a moment\nlonger, then smiled. “Still. I daresay you’ll have it your way, Great Wolf.”\nAnd he followed Black Calder out of the hall."

To be sent back to his family.”\nWhitewater winced, prodding at a big bruise he’d picked up in the\nbattle. “I guess that’s what they do. With dead men.”\n“They packed him with salt, but I daresay he’ll be ripe by the time he\ngets there—”\n“Are you auditioning for his part as the war-weary one?” snapped Leo,\nnot enjoying this conversation at all. Not wanting to think about Barniva’s\ndeath. Not wanting to think about what part he might’ve had in it. “I’ve got\na bloody duel to win. They might be packing me in a box this time\ntomorrow!”\n“But they won’t need to send you anywhere,” said Whitewater, brow\ncrinkling with puzzlement. “Your mother’s in the camp.”\nLeo gritted his teeth. “My point is, I need to focus. It’s a shame about\nBarniva. He was a brave man. A good friend. Always there when you\nneeded him.” He felt his voice quavering a little. “If he hadn’t put his shield\nacross me…” Perhaps he’d still be alive. All his tedious warnings about the\nhorrors of war seemed wise words now. Leo never thought he might have\nmissed them. “It’s a damn shame about Barniva, but we’ll have to mourn\nhim later. Right now, we need to make his sacrifice worthwhile. Him, and\nRitter, and all the others…” His voice was quavering again, damn it. He felt\na surge of anger. “I need you all to bloody focus. I have to pick a weapon to\ntake to the Circle. My life might hang on the choice.”\nJurand straightened up. “I’m sorry. It’s just…” And he sagged back\ndown. “In a box.”\n“Spear,” said Antaup. “It has the reach, the speed, the finesse—”\n“Finesse.” Whitewater chuckled. “The Circle’s no place for finesse.”\nGlaward rolled his eyes like he never heard such folly. “And once Stour\nNightfall slips around your pig-sticker, what then?”\n“Your counterproposal?” asked Antaup with an urbane arched eyebrow.\n“A monstrous battleaxe, I daresay, heavier than he is, that he can swing\ntwice before he’s blown?”\nGlaward looked slightly affronted. “They make small axes, too.”\n“Spear’s too cumbersome for single combat in a small space.” Jin\ngrimaced as he rubbed at his bruised cheek again. “Axe is simple, sturdy,\ngood close up.”\n“If you want close up, a sword’s more versatile.” Antaup mimed the\nactions. “Thrust, slash, lunge, pommel strike.”\nGlaward rolled his eyes. “Always with the bloody pommel strike.

That’s why I’m asking you!”\n“Maybe you should ask someone clever.” Jin was wobbling a tooth now,\njust behind the bruise, checking if it was loose. “Like your mother.”\n“We’re not on the best of terms right now,” said Leo, grumpily. “She’s\nnot too keen on the whole duel idea.”\nThere was a brief silence. Antaup and Glaward exchanged a meaningful\nglance. Then Jurand sat forward, all open and earnest, flames reflected in\nthe corners of his eyes. Leo couldn’t deny it had an effect on him, when he\ndid that. “Do you think… maybe… you should listen to her?”\n“Really? Now?”\n“Well, she’s about the best tactician I know—”\n“So you don’t think I can do it?”\n“No one believes in you more than me!” Jurand cleared his throat,\nglanced at the others, sat back a little. “More than us. But single combat…\nit’s a gamble. Anything could happen. I don’t…we don’t want you to get…\nhurt.” His voice failed him on the last word and became a croak. As if he\ncouldn’t quite bring himself to say “killed.” They all knew it could only be\nvictory or the Great Leveller.\n“You any good with a whip?” asked Antaup.\nLeo stared at him. “Seriously?”\n“I once saw this Gurkish woman whip swords out of men’s hands. At a\nshow. They came up from the audience, and, well, it was quite something.\nShe whipped a girl’s dress half-off without cutting her, too.” And he grinned\nat the memory.\n“So I should whip Stour Nightfall’s clothes off?” asked Leo.\n“No, but, you know, I was thinking of something he couldn’t use, and\n—”\n“I should whip the bloody lot of you.” Rikke walked up, pushing chagga\naround her bottom lip with her tongue, as usual, and slowly shaking her\nshaggy head. Leo was glad to see her. Very glad. She always made him feel\ngood. Long Eye or not, she always saw past the nonsense, somehow, and\nright to the heart of things. She helped him see to the heart of things. The\ndead knew, he needed some clarity then.\n“We’re talking of weapons, woman,” grumbled Glaward.\n“I heard, man,” said Rikke, “and you’re talking with your arses. What\nyou take into the Circle in your hands matters far less than what you take in\nyour head.” And she tapped at the side of her skull. “Doubt you lot are\nmuch help with the former and you’re a bloody hindrance with the latter.”\n“And how many duels have you fought?” complained Jin.\n“As many as all you lot put together,” she answered smartly. “Now lose\nyourselves, I need to talk to my champion.”"

She’s used\nto taking charge, Leo, now she’s helpless. She’s scared, I reckon.”\n“She’s scared? I’m the one has to fight the Great Wolf!

All my life, I\nwanted to fight in the Circle.” He clutched at his head. “Bloody hell, Rikke,\nwhy did I ever want to fight in the Circle?”\nShe caught him by the wrists, pulled them down. “No one remembers\nhow the fight was won, only who won it. Fight hard.”\n“I will.”\n“Fight dirty.”\n“I will.”\n“The lion beat the wolf.”\n“I know.”\n“No. You don’t.” She took his face now, with both hands. “The lion beat\nthe wolf. I’ve seen it.” Her big, pale eyes were full of certainty, and he took\nheart from that. Started to feel braver. To feel himself again. The Young\nLion! She was just what he needed then. A spring of belief in a desert of\ndoubt. It’s like they say, every good man needs a good woman beside him.\nOr under him, anyway.\n“I bloody love you,” he said. Her brows shot up. Almost as high as his.\nWhy had he said that? Swept off by whatever emotion blew his way, like\nhis mother always said he was. “I mean… I don’t mean love love,” he\nstammered. What the hell did he mean? What did you call it, when a\nwoman was your lover and your friend? It had never happened to him\nbefore. “Or… maybe I do mean that—”\n“Then promise me one thing.” She put her hand around the back of his\nhead and dragged him close, so their noses were almost touching. “Promise\nme you’ll kill the bastard.”\nHe bared his teeth. “I promise. Killing the bastard is the whole point.\nFor you. For your father. For Ritter. For Barniva…” He smiled. “Barniva’s\nsword. That’s what I’ll take.”\n“Good choice, I reckon.”"

Seemed the rivers of\nblood spilled yesterday had only sharpened the thirst for more. Losing a\nduel himself had much diminished Clover’s taste for the business, but he’d\nbeen asked to hold a shield for the heir to the North and that was reckoned\nquite the honour. Felt prudent to at least arrive in good time.\nA patch of grass had been shaved to the roots not far from the bridge\nwhere the fighting had been hottest, the Circle marked out with pegs and\nrope, six good strides across. Carpenters had knocked up some seating on\nplatforms so the big folk would get a good view of everyone’s futures being\nsettled. So Black Calder and Scale Ironhand, and the Dogman and Lady\nBrock wouldn’t miss a drop of blood spilled. Be a shame for it to hit the dirt\nunnoticed, after all.\nGood weather for it. Blue washing out to pale on the horizon as the sun\nsank wearily towards the hills. A great arrow of geese was honking off\nsouthwards, high up, not caring much for the doings of men. Not caring\nmuch who won or lost, who lived or died. Good to know the geese’d still be\nflapping regardless, though it would likely be scant comfort to whichever\nhero got a sword up his arse.\nThe men who held the shields around the Circle, making sure no one left\ntill the business was settled, were meant to be the fiercest warriors either\nside could find and, to be fair, the younger ones were shooting some warlike\nglares across the shortened grass. The older ones had seen it all before,\nthough, and saved their snarls for when they mattered. For all they stood on\ndifferent sides, some of Scale’s and the Dogman’s Named Men were\nchatting like old friends. Clover knew most o’ the names. Red Hat and\nOxel, Flatstone and Brodd Silent, Lemun the Chalk from up near Yaws and\nGregun Hollowhead from the West Valleys. The Nail, too, pale hair stuck\nup like thistle-fluff, bound all over with bloody bandages from yesterday’s\nfighting.\nStrange, in a way, for men who’d been fixed on killing each other a few\nhours before to be happily mingling, stamping and blowing and polishing\ntheir shield-rims, mulling over fights long past, the fight just done and the\nfight to come. But then warriors on different sides always had more in\ncommon with each other than with anyone else.\n“Loneliest o’ professions,” murmured Clover to himself. Shepherds\nmight not make many friends, but they weren’t often called upon to kill the\nones they had made, either.\n“Jonas Steepfield.” Clover jerked around at the whispering voice, the"

A big man\nstood beside him with a battered shield on his arm, grey hair stirring in the\nwind about a grey stubbled face with a scar that put Clover’s to shame. And\nin the midst of that scar, a bright ball of dead metal where an eye should’ve\nbeen.\n“If it ain’t Caul Shivers. I don’t go by Steepfield any more. I learned a\nbig hard name makes men want to take a blade to you just so they can cut\noff a piece of it.”\nShivers gave the kind of weary nod that’s born of hard experience. “The\nworld’s full of eager fools, all right.”\n“No call for me to be swelling their number. It’s just Clover now.”\n“There was clover in that Circle, eh? Where you fought.”\n“There was. Whenever I smell it, I remember how being beaten feels.”\nShivers gave that weary nod again, looking off towards the hills. “We\nshould talk, sometime. One scarred old warhorse to another.”\n“You’re the warhorse, Shivers. I’m more a crow, picking at the\nleftovers.”\n“Not that I don’t like the act, it’s a good one.” Shivers glanced over\ntowards Greenway, prancing around like he was the one about to face the\nYoung Lion and was sure of winning, too. “Don’t doubt you’ve got a lot of\neager fools taking you for quite the figure of fun.” He leaned close to\nwhisper. Or maybe to whisper even more throatily. “But we both know\nwhat y’are.”\nClover had heard it said Caul Shivers could see your thoughts with that\nmetal eye. Horseshit, of course. But he’d seen plenty with the other. Few\nmen more. Might be the hardest name in the North still casting a shadow.\nHe didn’t need a magic eye to make some sharp guesses.\nClover took a breath. “Aye, well, we all play the cards we’re dealt.”\n“Some of us do. Some of us kill men with better cards and play theirs\ninstead. What’s this Stour Nightfall like as a fighter?”\n“I wouldn’t want to fight him.”\n“A sensible man does his best to avoid any fight.”\n“Any fair one.”\nA pause, and they watched the folk crowd in, from the Union side and\nthe North. Warriors, servants, women, more and more of them until there\nwas a gabbling crowd in every direction.\n“What’s he like as a man?” asked Shivers.\n“About what you’d expect from someone they call the Great Wolf.\nCertainly no better. What about Brock?”\nShivers shrugged. “About what you’d expect from someone they call the\nYoung Lion. Certainly no worse.”\n“Huh. Since we’ve got all the answers, I sometimes wonder why we\nfollow these bastards.”\nThe noise swelled up, cheers on one side and grumbles on the other, and\nBethod’s sons came through the press, as ill-matched a pair of brothers as\never there were.

Black Calder, lean as a spear and frowning like thunder.\n“I hear a lot of talk about loyalty,” said Shivers as the men who’d ruled\nthe North for the best part of twenty years took their high seats above the\nCircle.\nClover snorted. “Since we’ve a dozen dead masters between us, and\nboth had a hand in more’n one of the downfalls, I feel no shame in saying\nthat loyalty is overrated.”\n“Helps to have someone worth being loyal to.” The cheers and grumbles\nwere reversed as a lean old man with long hair and a pointed face\nclambered stiffly onto the seats opposite.\n“The Dogman?” He looked grey. Grey-clothed, grey-haired, grey-faced,\nlike the life had leaked out of him to leave a wispy husk a sudden gust\nmight whisk away. “The man looks a touch past his best.”\nShivers cast a lazy eye towards Scale, and back. He had a way of saying\na lot with a few words. “Least he had one.”\n“Aye.” Clover gave a weary sigh. “Got a lot o’ respect for the Dogman,\nas it goes. Only man won any kind of power in the North in my lifetime and\nstayed halfway decent. The rest—Bethod, the Bloody-Nine, Black Dow,\nBlack Calder, well… between you and me…” Clover scratched gently at his\nscar and dropped his voice very low. “It’s been quite the who’s-the-biggest-\ncunt contest, wouldn’t you say?”\nShivers slowly nodded. “A real arsehole’s parade.”\n“But then the arseholes tend to win, don’t they? Maybe I’m weak, but\nI’d rather be on the winning side, even if the losers smell sweeter.”\n“You should meet his daughter.”\n“Who, the Dogman’s?”\n“Aye. Rikke. I’ll make no promises for her odour but she’s worth talking\nto.” He nodded towards the platform, where a girl was clambering over the\nback, all knees and elbows, to wedge herself between the Dogman and a\npale, hard Union woman Clover reckoned to be the one-time Lady\nGovernor of Angland.\nShe pushed her tangle of red-brown hair out of her face to show those\nbig grey eyes and he’d no doubt it was her. The one who’d come tumbling\ndown the hill and fallen at his feet. The one he’d let scamper off into the\nwoods.\n“We met in passing. Struck me as two-thirds o’ nothing.”\n“Then you misjudged her.”\nNo doubt she was fine-looking, but more than a bit mad-looking, too,\nwild and twitchy with a cross painted over one eye, a fat gold ring through\nher nose and a mass of rattling chains around her neck like she was learning\nto be some hillwoman sorceress but hadn’t actually got to the spells yet.\n“You sure?” he asked.\n“Do I look like a man prone to fancy?”\nClover gave Shivers a quick glance up and down. “About as little as any\nliving. And I was long ago cured of the misapprehension that I’m right on\nevery score.”"

And I was long ago cured of the misapprehension that I’m right on\nevery score.”\n“The wiser a man is, the more he stands ready to be educated.” There\nwas a little curl at the corner of Shivers’ mouth as he watched Rikke\nflapping her hands around. A hint of pride, maybe. The most feeling he’d let\nshow the whole time they’d talked. Anyone who could coax some warmth\nfrom that face-shaped block of rock was someone worth watching, Clover\nreckoned.\nAround the edge of the Circle, the shield-carriers were starting to form\nup, folk pressing in behind them, eager for the best view of the murder. “Let\nme know when you want that chat, then, Shivers, you old bastard.” Clover\nhefted his shield and stepped away to find his own place. “My ears are\nalways open to a better way of doing things.”\nRikke had been hoping the hate would melt when she finally saw Stour\nNightfall’s face, because her hate for him was getting to feel like quite the\nweight to carry. She’d look in his eyes and see he wasn’t the monster who’d\nwhined his hopes for her horrible murder, who’d burned her father’s garden\nand killed good folk she knew, but just a man with loves and fears like any\nother, and her hate would melt.\nAs so often with hopes, and hatreds, it didn’t quite turn out that way.\nThe king-in-waiting strutted preening into the Circle to wild cheers from\nhis side, lauded and clapped and slapped on the back, and stood there with a\ndamp-eyed smirk like a wedding guest who’d pricked the bride the night\nbefore.\n“That’s Nightfall?” murmured Finree dan Brock, sitting pale and stiff\nbeside Rikke and quite clearly trying to put a brave face over her misery.\n“That’s him.” Rikke narrowed her eyes, wishing she could see through\nhim. See some clue to what he’d do. See some weakness Leo could use. See\nhis death coming.\nBut the Long Eye cannot be forced open, and all she saw was that\ninfuriating bloody smirk, like he was the one who could see the future and\nfor him it held nothing but victories. He glanced her way, and that wolf grin\ngrew a tooth wider each side, and he sauntered over to her half of the\nCircle.\n“You’re Rikke, then?” he called out, giving her a slow look up and down\nwith those wet eyes, his mouth open and his tongue showing. “You’re\nprettier’n I thought you’d be.”\nShe gave him the same sort of look, but with her mouth scorn-twisted.\n“You’re about as ugly as I was expecting.”\n“I hear you can see what’s coming. Did you see yourself sucking my\ncock yet?”\nJeering laughter at that, and Rikke clenched her fists. “Just you losing in\nthe Circle.”\nHe only grinned the wider. “I know you’re lying about that one. Might\nbe you’re lying about the other.” And he gave her a sly wink as he turned\naway. Winked at her, the bastard, and she felt the hate boil up hotter than\never."

Winked at her, the bastard, and she felt the hate boil up hotter than\never.\n“Don’t worry about it!” she screamed, jumping to her feet and jabbing\naway with one clawing finger. “Once Leo’s broke you in half, you can suck\nyour own!”\nGot some laughs at least from the folk on her side, and some ugly stares\nfrom Stour’s shield-carriers. She recognised the Nail in their midst, staring\nright at her with his pale brows thoughtfully wrinkled, and she curled her\ntongue into a tube and blew spit at him, and he grinned, and gave a little\nbow.\n“Easy,” muttered her father, pulling her back down by the elbow. “Hard\nwords are for fools and cowards. Stour might be both, but you’re neither.”\n“Winking wanker,” she growled. “I’ll see him fucked by a pig, the\nbastard. I’ll see him strung up with brambles and the bloody cross cut in\nhim. I’ll send his guts to his daddy in a box. With herbs. So they won’t\nsmell ’em till they open it.”\nShe saw her father staring at her, and looking quite worried, too.\n“What?” she grumbled, hunching her shoulders. “Didn’t think I had it in\nme to hate a man?”\n“Be careful, is all I’m saying. Hate a man that much, you give him\npower over you.”\n“Maybe. But it goes back to the mud with him.” Her voice sounded hard\nin her own ear. “The Great Leveller cancels all debts.”\nThe whoops and taunts from their side of the Circle became cheers as\nLeo pushed through the crowd, his friends at his back.\nHer father leaned close. “Have it in you to love a man, too?” She looked\nat him, caught by surprise. “I’m old, Rikke, not blind.”\nLeo flinched as the wall of shields clattered shut behind him, like a\nprisoner might at the turning of the jailer’s key. He’d said he loved her.\nWasn’t that she thought he was lying. Just that she doubted he’d ever love\nanyone more than himself.\n“There are things I love about him.” Best stomach she’d ever seen, for\ninstance. “There are things I don’t.” Biggest head she’d ever known, for\ninstance.\n“You can hate things about a person and still love ’em. Ain’t easy,\nwatching someone you love walk into the Circle.”\nRikke bunched her fists until the nails bit at her palms. “Helps if you\nhate the other bastard more.”\nThe noise started to fade as Isern-i-Phail stepped out onto the short-\nshaved grass, chewing slowly with her tall spear in her hand. When all that\nremained was a nervy silence, she wedged her chagga down behind her lip\nwith her tongue.\n“I’m Isern-i-Phail!

And being\na hillman, the closest thing to a neutral party anyone could find. I am as\nwell known as he.” And she lifted her chin and gestured at herself. “But for\nmy piercing wits and haunting beauty.” More laughter. “Seems it’s fallen to\nme as a hillwoman to judge this bout.” She grinned over at Stour. “Though I\nshould declare up front that I hate this cunt over here, and might yet be\nprevailed upon to kill him myself.”\nThe laughter only made Rikke more nervous.\n“Have to admire your honesty,” said Stour.\n“I couldn’t give a moth’s cock what you admire, but the judging of a\nduel is a sacred trust and so on and bloody so on, and you can trust me to\njudge this one fairly, I’m sure.”\n“Wouldn’t worry,” said Stour. “Me standing over his corpse won’t need\nmuch judging. You say start. I’ll handle the rest.”\n“Whoa there, boy!” shouted Isern. “The moon loves a proper order to\nthings, and there’s the introductions, stakes and choice o’ weapons to see to.\nDon’t worry, I’ll waste no time inflating your bloated names any more than\nI have to. Over here on my…” She thought for a moment, frowned at Leo,\nfrowned at her hands, frowned at the sky, then snapped her fingers. “Left!\nOn my left, we’ve got Leo dan Brock, son of Finree dan Brock, newly\nminted Lord Governor of Angland, who men call the Young Lion on\naccount of his youth and heroic opinion of himself. If he’s as skilful as he’s\npretty, we’ll have quite the fight.” She pointed her spear at Stour. “Which\nmeans this article must be on my right and it’s Stour Nightfall, d’you see,\nson of Black Calder and heir to the chain of Bethod, that men call the Great\nWolf ’cause of, who can say, the hairiest arse in the North, for all I know.\nHe beat Stranger-Come-Knocking in the Circle but we’re all aware the man\nwas way past his best.

She\nwas biting on her chagga pellet so hard, her whole face was aching, willing\nher guts to turn sickly, and her eye to turn hot, and some ghost of the future\nto show itself. But nothing came.\n“Your next question!” called Isern. “What are these two fools going to\nkill each other over? Mostly a matter of manly pride, as is proper in a duel,\nbut there’s also the rich, dark earth o’ the North.

All happy with the terms?”\nA quiet then. No one on Rikke’s side looked too happy about anything.\n“Dogman, Chieftain of Uffrith?” called Isern.\n“Aye,” said Rikke’s father, wearily.\n“Brock, Lord Governor of Angland?”\n“Aye,” snapped Leo.\n“Scale Ironhand, King of the Northmen?”\n“Aye,” rumbled Scale, jowls quivering as he smothered a burp, like this\nwas the third duel he’d watched that day. “Get to it, woman.”\n“Then I will, you hill of lard.” Isern thrust her spear into the ground with\na thud and snapped her fingers at Shivers. “Lend me your shield,\nhandsome.” He glanced over his shoulder like he thought she might be\ntalking to someone else, then tossed it to her. She snatched it from the air,\nset it down on its rim. “Straps or paint, Brock?” Though Shivers’ shield was\nso battered, only a few stubborn flakes of paint still clung to it.\n“Paint,” said Leo. Isern set the shield spinning, and men started shouting\nand whooping and calling, and beside her, Rikke felt Lady Finree give a\nkind of gasp, and she covered her eyes with her hands.\n“He’ll win,” said Rikke.\n“How can you know?”\nRikke took her cold, limp hand and squeezed it. “He’ll win,” she said,\nmaking it sound like a sure fact, for all her head was splitting with doubts.\nMaybe she could’ve talked him out of it. But it was too late now.\nThere was a rattle as the shield fell.\n“Straps down,” said Isern. “Your pick, Great Wolf.”\nStour caught Rikke’s eye and shrugged, more careless than ever, like the\nnotion of losing had never even occurred. “He can pick.”\n“Your pick, Young Lion.”\nLeo shook his head. “He can pick.”\n“Men!” And Isern rolled her eyes. “They never can commit. You’ll fight\nwith what you brought, then.” She tossed the shield back to Shivers,\nplucked her spear from the ground and pointed it at the men about the\nCircle, shields all facing inwards now, rims grating as they locked them\ntogether into a wall. “You lot, keep these two in here till it’s settled. And no\nmore interfering than is seemly.” She spat chagga juice, wiped her chin and\nnodded, like it was all set up to her satisfaction. “Let’s get to it.”\nWhere Names Are Made\nL\neo once heard someone say attack is the best defence.

He only just ducked\na wicked cut that could’ve taken his head right off, but Stour gave him no\nclumsy backswing to work with, stepped scornfully away from Leo’s\ncounter and pressed in again.\nSeemed Stour had heard that thing about attack and defence, too. But he\nwas better at it.\n“Kill him!” screeched Antaup.\n“Come on!” shouted Jurand.\n“Leo!” roared Glaward, shaking his shield. But Stour was already on\nhim again, three cuts so quick, Leo only dodged the first two by the barest\ninstinct. He reeled away from the third, fishing with his sword in a weak\neffort to keep his opponent back. Stour was the whirlwind. Leo was the leaf\nblown around the Circle.\nThe speed of him. He used a heavy Northman’s sword—broad blade,\nsolid crosspiece, weighty golden pommel—but he handled it nimbly as a\nStyrian rapier. Almost no backswing. Almost no recovery. Intentions\nmasterfully disguised.\nApart from Bremer dan Gorst, who’d a fair claim to being the greatest\nswordsman of the age, Leo never saw a blade handled with such savage\nskill. He felt the doubt creeping cold up his spine. He was used to being\nswaddled in a blanket of self-confidence, and the chill as it was stripped\naway was all the worse for being unfamiliar.\nBut Leo once heard someone say there are many ways to crack an egg.\nHadn’t been entirely sure of the meaning, but it struck him as a\nworkmanlike philosophy. Words to live by. Stour might have the speed, but\nLeo had the strength. He had to watch for his opening, pin the slippery\nbastard down and crush him like a walnut on an anvil.\nStour’s next thrust came deadly fast, but Leo was ready. He twisted,\nforced it away, pressed forward instead of falling back, caught a satisfying\nglimpse of surprise on Stour’s face. He cut and cut again, blows heavy with\nhis fear and frustration, jarring the sword in Nightfall’s hand.\nSteel scraped as Stour caught Leo’s blade on his, held it up short, the\nedge almost brushing the pointed tip of his nose.

He bared his teeth, growled, spat, but Stour forced him\nback, and back, until finally Leo was pushed off balance and had to stumble\naway, their swords ringing apart. He gasped as Stour’s blade came hissing\nat him, dodged desperately, slipped and nearly fell, reeled back into a little\nspace, breathing hard.\nThe crowd on the Northern side bellowed their approval. The crowd on\nthe Union’s murmured their disappointment. The Great Wolf gave a showy\nflourish of his sword and grinned. It was plain they were all coming to the\nsame conclusion.\nStour was the better swordsman.\nStill, Leo once heard someone say there’s always a way. He’d had his\ndoubts at the time, but now it struck him as a hopeful philosophy. Words to\nlive by? If he couldn’t beat the Great Wolf with speed or strength, he’d have\nto outlast him. Tire him with a dogged defence, a sullen determination, a\nstubborn endurance. He’d be the deep-rooted tree the hurricane can’t shift.\nHe had to wear the bastard down.\nStour thrust, but off-centre. It was easy for Leo to step around it, finally\nsensing an opening. But just as he pounced, Stour dipped his shoulder,\nwhipped his sword across in a flicking cut. Leo gasped as he felt the wind\nof the blade across his face. He slashed back but the Great Wolf was already\ndancing away, grinning, always grinning.\nThe crowd roared. For a moment, Leo thought it was for him. Then he\nfelt something tickling his cheek. Stour’s point had scratched his face, so\nquick and so sharp he’d hardly felt it. It was blood the crowd were cheering\nfor. His blood.\nAs Leo backed off, the cut began to tingle, then to throb. He wondered\nhow bad a scar it would leave. Wondered if it was a Naming Wound. But as\nthat cold doubt crept all the way up to his throat, he realised you had to live\nthrough the duel for that. The dead get no names.\nStour’s grin grew a tooth wider. A tooth crueller.\n“I’m going to bleed you, boy,” he said.\nClover jerked away as the point of Brock’s sword flashed past on the\nbackswing not a hand’s width from his nose. Stour darted in, all snarl and\nfury, thrust, thrust again. Brock gasped as he jumped back, knocking\nStour’s sword wide so it gouged into the shield just next to Clover’s.\nBy the dead, the noise. The grind of steel, the growls of the fighters, the\nmonstrous fury of the crowd.\nBy the dead, the crush.

A little piece of Jonas Steepfield,\nstuck in him like a splinter he could never quite dig out.\nThere wasn’t much in the world to get your heart pumping harder than\nwatching two men fight to the death. Only being one of ’em. He felt a guilty\nsurge of excitement as Stour dashed forward again. Felt the eager grin on\nhis own lips as Brock parried and fell back. No doubt he was a fine\nswordsman. But Stour was making him look ordinary. More so with every\nmoment. He used that big sword nimbly as a dressmaker might her needle,\nall wrist and flick and effortless mastery.\nAnother flurry of blows, high and low, point and edge. Brock shuffled,\nblocked, but Stour caught him with the last cut as he whipped by. A slice\nacross his left arm that sent a few spots of blood into the crowd. More than\nlikely he could’ve left Brock’s arm hanging off, but Stour hadn’t become\nthe Great Wolf by passing up a chance to pose, and he grinned as he showed\nthe red edge of his sword to the crowd. He wasn’t only a hell of a\nswordsman but a hell of a braggart. The two went together with depressing\nfrequency.\nBrock gritted his teeth, cheek red from the cut on his face, and came on\ndoggedly. You couldn’t fault his courage, but courage isn’t a warrior’s most\nvaluable virtue, whatever the songs say. It’s ruthlessness, and savagery, and\nquickness to strike that win fights, the very qualities in which Stour\nexcelled. He jumped in now, laughing as he swung his red sword in great\ncircles, sending Brock staggering into the wall of shields.\nClover caught the Young Lion on his as he stumbled, gave a little like a\ngood feather mattress, then nudged him back up so he could dodge, catch a\nblow of Stour’s and steer it wide with a screech of metal.\nHe doubted it’d change the result any. Looked like a black day for the\nUnion. A black day for Leo dan Brock and anyone who loved him. A fine\nthing for Jonas Clover, you’d have thought. He did stand on the other side,\nafter all, and winning was supposed to be meat and drink to a warrior.\nJust sometimes he wished he had the bones to pick the right side, even if\nit was the losing one.\nSomeone had taken to beating a drum, slow and heavy.

She clung to the\nbench as if it was the saddle of a horse she was trying to break, clung to\nFinree’s cold hand in her hot one so hard her wrist ached.\nShe knew with one twitch of a sword she might lose her lover, her home,\nher future.

One sharp piece of metal is all it takes to\nturn a man into mud. One little stroke of bad luck. One ill-judged whisper.\nHad she done this? Had she made this happen?\nShe gasped as Nightfall came forward, switched direction in a blink.\nSteel rang once, twice, Leo lashed back, but too slow and Stour slipped\naround it, his sword catching Leo’s leg and making him stagger.\n“No.” A kind of shudder went through Finree, and Rikke gripped her\nhand harder than ever. Tried to be strong for both of them though she wasn’t\nhalfway strong enough for herself. Tried to bare her teeth, and focus on\nStour’s smirk, and turn the sucking of fear and guilt into anger. Tried to\nmake something from it she could use.\nYou cannot force the Long Eye open, no more than you can order the\ntide to come in. But where was the harm in trying?\nShe planted her fists on her knees and sat forward. Refusing to blink.\nGlaring at the grass like she could glare through it to what might come.\nWilling that heat into her eye.\nMight be she saw what she wanted to. The dead knew there’d been\nplenty o’ that going on the past few days. But for the briefest moment, she\nthought she saw ghosts there, in the Circle. Faint, they were, and flickering.\nHints of figures. Stour and Leo, and their swords, torn apart like cobwebs\non the breeze as the real men passed through them."

Stour and Leo, and their swords, torn apart like cobwebs\non the breeze as the real men passed through them.\nRikke curled back her lips, and clenched her fists, and squeezed her jaw\nso hard it felt like her teeth might crack, and she stared at the Circle as if\nshe was staring into a gale.\nShe made herself see.\nStour was laughing now. Giggling as if every contact was a brilliant joke.\nLeo wasn’t finding it funny. He told himself he was the Young Lion. The\nLord Governor of Angland. The proud son of a proud line of warriors, with\nglory in his grasp. But in truth, he was scarcely even trying to hit back.\nBarniva’s sword was getting heavier every time he swung it. He was scared\nif he attacked, he’d give Stour a fatal opening. But he was scared if he\ndefended, things could only go one way.\nIt was getting to the point where he was just scared.\nStour jerked forward and Leo stumbled back. Just a mocking feint with\nthe foot, a twitch of the hand, and Leo was sent scampering. Stour wasn’t\nonly aiming to win now, but to make a show of it. To teach a lesson. To\nshow the whole North that the Great Wolf was a man to be feared. His\nsword flickered past Leo’s tired guard. Stour could’ve spitted him, but he\nchose just to prick his stomach. Prick him then whip away again, laughing.\nHe was the Young Lion, but he was bleeding. Blood on his face, blood\non his leg. Red streaks down his right hand, grip of Barniva’s sword sticky\nwith it. The idea of blood watering the Circle had thrilled him when he\nlistened to stories of the Bloody-Nine. Thrills you a lot less when it’s your\nown.\nHe was the Young Lion, but he was tiring. He panted, gasped, cold air\nraw in his throat, but he could never get enough breath. His knees were\ntrembling, the snap going out of his arm. No way he could outlast Stour\nnow. His only chance was to out-think him. Trouble was, he’d never been\nmuch of a thinker. If he had been, he might not have taken the challenge in\nthe first place.\nHis eyes darted about the Circle, searching for some clue.\nHis friends, their shields drooping. Glaward chewing his lip. Jin tearing\nhis beard. Antaup crestfallen. Jurand wincing as if he felt every wound\nhimself. He caught a glimpse of his mother, stricken, pale, staring. The\nDogman sat grim beside her, and Rikke, glaring into the Circle, fiddling\nwith the ring through her nose.\nFight dirty, she’d told him. No one remembers how the fight was won,\nonly who won it. A gritty philosophy. Words to die by.\nStour feinted and Leo fell back again, stumbled again, but this time he\nwent down harder than he had to. He put a hand out behind as if to steady\nhimself, tore up a handful of grass. Stour came on again, grinning, and Leo\ngrowled as he forced the snap into his legs, sprang up, throwing his grass in\nStour’s face, swinging his sword at Stour’s neck."

He\nsmashed his forehead into Stour’s mouth with a glorious crunch, making the\nGreat Wolf stagger back onto the shields of his men.\nFor a moment, his eyes were bleary, his bloody mouth wide with\nsurprise. Leo took a great whooping breath, brought his sword whistling up\nand over, but the blade hacked into the shields where Stour had been a\nmoment before, and Leo only just kept his grip on the buzzing hilt.\nStour danced back, spitting grass, showing red teeth as he grinned. “Oh,\nnow we got us a fight!”\nHe darted one way, switched in an instant and whipped past on the other\nside, quick as the wind and as hard to pin down. Leo was left stranded,\ngasped as the edge of Stour’s sword whipped across his thigh, left a cold\nline that soon turned burning hot. It was the most he could do to stay\nstanding as the blood soaked into his trouser leg.\nHe wasn’t a lion, he was a scared little boy who didn’t want to die.\nBut it was too late to listen to Mother now.\nBrock was cut bad. Red streaks down his face from the cut on his cheek,\ntrousers dark around the cut on his leg, hand red from the cut on his arm.\nWatering the Circle with his blood, as the skalds have it. Not a pleasant\nsight, but nothing Clover hadn’t seen before. Hadn’t lived before. If\npleasant sights are what you’re after, the Circle’s a bad place to come.\nStour was sure of victory. Grinning like a wolf, strutting like a cock. The\nkind that rules the farmyard rather’n the kind you piss with, but Clover\nreckoned both meanings fit the heir to the North pretty well. He laughed,\narms spread wide, urging the crowd to ever-louder shrieks of admiration\nand delight. Some men take to applause like other men take to drink. The\nmore they get, the more they need, until too much is never enough.\nScale was loving it almost as much as his nephew, shaking his iron hand\nat the Circle and roaring, “Play with him!” The admiration of one cock for\nanother. Seemed to sting an effort from Brock, who lumbered in, sluggish\nfrom the bleeding, took a clumsy swing you could see coming ten strides\noff. Stour flicked it away with a contemptuous sneer, could’ve chopped\nBrock across the back but chose to let him stumble by.\n“Finish him, damn it!” snarled Black Calder, as disgusted by his son’s\ndisplay as his brother was delighted by it.\nStour could’ve finished Brock five times now but he was enjoying\nhooking him so much, he kept letting him wriggle free so he could hook\nhim again. Clover thought that ill-advised, to say the least. You take no risks\nin the Circle and give no chances, not with all you’ve got and all you’ll ever\nhave in the balance.

Her left eye was hot, burning in her head. She forced it open\nwider, staring, staring.\nLeo bent, clumsy, hunched around the wound in his side, blood-streaked\ntop to toe. Stour looked quicker than ever, surer than ever, prancing,\ndancing, only a short step from blowing kisses to the audience.\nRikke saw ghosts of swords and spears above the crowd. Of flags\nshifting with a wind that wasn’t there. The battle yesterday? A battle yet to\ncome? By the dead, she wanted to be sick. Her head was pulsing. The cold\nsweat tickled at her scalp, trickled down her face, but she didn’t dare shift\nher eyes. Didn’t dare blink. Didn’t dare break the spell.\nThere were ghosts in the Circle, too. Shimmering and shifting. Ghosts of\nLeo and of Stour. Ghosts of hands and feet and faces. Ghosts of swords.\nLeo winced as Stour’s blade caught him across the belly. Not a killing\nblow. Just a kiss. A slash that spotted the shields beside him with blood. Leo\nstumbled, fell to his knees, sword slipping from his hand into the grass.\n“No,” whispered Leo’s mother, tears running down her cheeks as she\nclosed her eyes.\nNightfall turned slowly around in the middle of the Circle, stretching out\nthe victory, sucking up the glory, and he looked over his shoulder at Rikke,\nand he winked.\nBy the dead, her eye was on fire.

The rest is for fools to sing about.”\nShe saw it in the Great Wolf’s scabbard, whipped free as the duel began,\ncut and thrust, the Circle full of the bright ribbons of its passing.\nShe saw it swung in a shining blur at neck height, Stour’s teeth bared in\na triumphant snarl.

For beyond Stour’s bright sword she saw a crack in the sky, and\nbeyond that crack a black pit yawned, a pit with no bottom and no end and\nno beginning in which there was a knowing not of a sword or an arrow but\nof everything. A knowing so vast and terrible that the merest splinter of it\nmight rip her mind apart.\nLeo dragged himself to his knees, groggy, bloody, clawing his own blade\nfrom the grass.\nRikke tottered up with him, moaning, gasping, gripping her throbbing\nhead. The sky was opening, sucking her in.\nStour smiled. Began to turn. Rikke’s eye was a smouldering coal in her\nskull.\nLeo started to clamber up, head rising towards the shimmering ghost of\nStour’s sword.\nShe clapped her hands over her burning face and screamed out in the\nUnion tongue, screamed at the very top of her lungs.\n“Go low!”\nLeo couldn’t have said why, but it seemed important he die on his feet.\nHardly hurt any more. Just numb. Just weak. So heavy.\nTook everything he had to heave himself up.\nThe world wobbled like jelly, all dark earth and bright pink sky and a\nswimming mass of painted shields and snarling faces and smoking breath.\nHe could hardly hear for his own thudding heartbeat, hardly tell the\nroaring of the crowd from the roaring of his breath. He’d clutched up a\nhandful of grass along with his sword. Bloody grass. Bloody dirt.\nHis mouth tasted like metal. In battle, a man finds out who he truly is.\nHe forced his legs straight, swaying, trying to focus.\nHe caught a glimpse of Stour turning away, a flash of his bloody grin.\nThen, over the din of the crowd, he heard a scream.\n“Go low!”\nSo he dropped. Or just fell, maybe. Felt wind pluck at his hair and with a\nlast effort swung his sword low. Far from his best swing ever. Clumsy and\nweak, grip loose in his sore fingers.\nBut sometimes a bad swing can be good enough.\nThere was a smack as the blade chopped deep into Nightfall’s thigh.\nStour’s eyes bulged, and he opened his mouth very wide and made a\nstrange, high shriek. More shock than pain. He staggered a half-step, took a\ngreat whooping breath in the sudden silence and started screeching again.\nMore pain than shock, this time.\nLeo pulled his sword free and Nightfall tottered, spluttering bloody spit,\nrearing up on his good leg, raising his sword high so the blade glimmered\nred with the setting sun.\nA slap as Leo caught Stour’s fist in his and stepped forward, growling,\njerking his other arm out hard so the pommel of Barniva’s sword crunched\ninto Nightfall’s face, cutting his shriek off dead.

Leo stood\nover him, by some strange chance holding both the swords. How had that\nhappened?\nThe painted shields of the men around the Circle drifted down, limp,\ntheir mouths dropping open, and no one more shocked than Leo himself.\nAnd now the noise of the crowd on his side rose up, louder than ever.\nShock turned to stunned delight, and stunned delight to wild triumph.\n“Leo dan Brock!”\n“The Young Lion!”\nAnd, loudest of all, “Kill him!”\nNo doubt Nightfall would’ve killed Leo, if he’d been the one lying\nthere, helpless. Would’ve killed him in the slowest, most painful, most\nshameful way he could. Would’ve crowed his victory from the rooftops of\nUffrith and laughed as the skalds sang the story back to him for years to\ncome.\nStour tried to wriggle away, gave a bubbling moan as he moved his\nwounded leg, then cowered as the points of the two swords came to hover\nover his neck. He stared up, bloody hair stuck across his face, eyes wide\nand full of fear.\nNot invincible, after all.\nThe shouts found a rhythm and became a chant.\n“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!”\nLouder and louder, the smoke of the shouted words rising up into the\nchill evening all around.\n“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!”\nLouder and louder, joined by the rattle of weapons, the clash of fist on\nshield, the thud of stomped boots making the chill ground shake, matching\nLeo’s thudding heartbeat, echoing through him from his feet to his scalp.\n“Kill him!” he heard Glaward roaring over his shield.\n“Kill him!” he heard Antaup shriek, face twisted with fury.\n“Kill the fucker!” snarled Whitewater Jin.\nLeo saw his mother, tears in her eyes and a hand over her mouth. He saw\nthe Dogman, caught halfway between sitting and standing with a\ndisbelieving grin. He saw Rikke, stood up from the bench between them,\nher hands over her face, one eye gleaming between her fingers.\n“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!”\nLeo took a long, cold breath, lifted Barniva’s sword and Stour’s, the\ngrowl in his raw throat growing to a throbbing roar as he brought them both\nstabbing down with a single thud.\nRight into the turf on either side of the Great Wolf’s cringing face.\n“Stour Nightfall,” he mumbled. Even speaking was a mighty effort then,\neach word a great stone to lift. “I spare… your life.”\nDizzy as hell, and he dropped on one knee.

We all go free.”\nSilence, while everyone thought over what that meant. It was a lot more\nthan they’d expected that morning, maybe. But so much less than they’d\ndreamed of a few weeks before.\nIt was a sorry little meeting, in a looted warehouse with a chill breeze\nblowing through the broken doors. Fifteen Breakers, each in charge of a\ndifferent district of Valbeck. As far as anyone was in charge of the chaotic\nwarren of garbage the city had been reduced to. The gaunt and grim who’d\nstayed to the bitter end. They would’ve liked to call themselves the most\nloyal, but maybe they were just the ones with most to lose.\nBroad took a breath. He should never have got involved. He’d known it\nthen and he knew it now. But he’d told himself things might change.\nSmashed his face against the wall again, sure that this time it wouldn’t hurt.\nFor all his promises to be a new man, somehow he always made the same\nwrong choices.\n“Full pardons?” asked a woman with a pinched-in grey face.\nHeron nodded, though he didn’t look all that convinced. “So His\nHighness tells us.”\n“What did that bastard Pike have to say?” asked Sarlby.\n“He didn’t like it,” said Vick. “But he didn’t disagree.”\n“You trust Orso?” asked Broad.\n“Best never to make a decision based on trust,” said Vick, like trust was\nsome fantastic beast only children believed in. “Just on what’s best for\nmost.”\nMalmer gave a sigh that sounded like it rose from the very dregs of a\nwell of weariness. “Coming to something, when revolutionaries pin their\nhopes on the crown prince. He seems decent enough, though, considering.\nFar better than expected.”\n“Expectations could hardly have been lower,” said Vick, frowning, as\nalways. She’d some frown on her, that woman.\nMalmer gave a helpless shrug. “Guess I trust him more than most of the\nroyal family. But then, I trusted Risinau. Look where that got us.”\n“Truth is, we’ve no choice,” said Heron. “We’re out of food. We didn’t\ndo this to starve our own people.”\n“Sometimes I wonder why we did do it.”\nCouple of months ago at those big meetings, folk would’ve fallen over\nthemselves to list all the wrongs they’d die to put right. Now no one offered\nMalmer a reason. The causes had turned hazy, lately. Like far-off chimneys\nthrough the vapours, you could hardly tell if they were there or just a trick\nof your mind.\n“Then that’s it, I reckon,” said Malmer. “Send word to everyone who’s\nstill listening. We pull down the barricades. We open the city. We\nsurrender.”\nOne by one, the others nodded their agreement. Mournful, like that nod\ncost a little piece of themselves. But no one could see another way. The\nuprising was done.\n“Sticks in my gullet,” said Sarlby, “giving up.”"

The\nuprising was done.\n“Sticks in my gullet,” said Sarlby, “giving up.”\nBroad clapped him on the shoulder. “Be thankful you’ve got something\nin your gullet.”\nThere was still a tang of old burning on the air outside. Of old burning\nand new rot. Ashes blew down the street, settling on the rubbish like little\ndrifts of black snow. Not far off stood the shell of a gutted mill, blackened\nrafters sticking naked into the pale sky, blackened windows gaping empty.\n“And this was supposed to be our Great Change.” Malmer slowly shook\nhis white head. Broad could’ve sworn he’d turned whiter the last few days.\n“What a fucking disaster.”\n“I’m not crying for those owners lost their mills,” snapped Sarlby. “I can\ntell you that.”\n“What about the jobs in those mills?” asked Vick. “Daresay the rich folk\nwhose investments went up in smoke will muddle through. What about the\npoor folk lost their livings?”\n“Thought we were doing good,” said Malmer, worn face crunched up\nwith wrinkled disbelief. “Sure we were doing good.”\n“Good and bad aren’t as easy to tell apart as you’d think,” said Vick.\n“Mostly it’s a matter of where you look at ’em from.”\n“That’s the sorry truth,” grunted Broad.\nMalmer frowned towards that burned-out shell. “It’s the poor pay the\nprice, again.”\nBroad remembered Musselia after the sack. The slums looted and turned\ninto smouldering ruins, corpses scattered in the streets. But the palace\nuntouched on the high ground above the smoke. He worked his mouth and\nspat. “Always the poor pay the price.”\nFolk poured out of Valbeck that night. Columns of them snaking past the\nabandoned barricades and across the fields. A few were Breakers, going to\nsurrender their arms and take their chances at amnesty. Most were folk\nwho’d heard there might be food.\nThe first to meet the wary queue of the filthy, hungry and dispossessed\nwere smiling women, handing out loaves. You might’ve thought they had\nundiluted hope rather than bread in their barrows for the good humour they\nspread down the column. A few days before, folk couldn’t have found\nlanguage harsh enough to describe Crown Prince Orso. A bit of bread in\ntheir bellies and they were frothing over with praise for him. Broad was no\nbetter than the rest as he caught that heavenly smell of baking, mouth\nwatering up a rainstorm. Seeing May and Liddy’s smiles when they ate their\nshare was a better gift even than the bread itself. Ardee didn’t smile. Broad\ndidn’t think he’d ever seen her smile. Just chewed, staring at her shuffling\nfeet, eyes big and damp in her thin, thin face.\nWasn’t long after the taste of bread faded that Broad was back to the\nworried old killer he’d been that morning. The sun slunk down towards\ndistant woods and the cold came on and they reached a knot of blank-faced\nsoldiers collecting weapons.

On you go.”\nHanding in a weapon had felt too close to an admission of guilt to\nBroad. He’d thrown his down a well before they left and been glad to see\nthem go. Might be it’s people who kill people, but you can’t stab a man\nwith a blade you haven’t got.\n“I’ve got nothing,” he said to the officer in charge, shifting his lenses on\nhis nose as if to imply he was a man of learning. “Wouldn’t know what to\ndo with a blade.”\nThe officer looked him up and down as if that was a bit too rich for\neither one of them to swallow, but he jerked his head onwards.\nAnother hour of shuffling and the sky started to darken, the mood\ndarkening with it. Folk muttered that the Inquisition were up ahead, asking\nquestions. Pulling people from the column. Anyone who’d been tight with\nthe Breakers. Soldiers on horseback prowled the fields to either side of the\nroad, torches in gauntleted fists. Some wanted to think the best. Others were\nsure they’d all be hanged for treason on the spot. No one left, though. Like\nlambs queueing up for the slaughterman’s knife, they only huddled tighter\ntogether and kept plodding towards the bleak unknown.\n“Don’t like this,” whispered Liddy.\nBroad didn’t like it much, either. After what he’d done in Valbeck, and\nwhat he’d done on his farm, and what he’d done in Styria, could he really\nhope to wriggle free now? It’s coming to something when you reassure\nyourself with the thought that there’s no justice in the world.\nA good score of soldiers were gathered where the road passed through a\ngate in a tumbledown wall, a good score of masked Practicals with them.\nAll under the supervision of a black-coated Inquisitor, torchlight finding the\nhollows in his pale face and making him look quite the demon. While Broad\nwas watching, two men were led away to the side and a kind of nervous\nmoan spread through the column. He felt a sudden desire to run, glanced\nabout for his best route of escape.\n“Calm yourselves!” called the Inquisitor. “His Highness the crown\nprince has offered a full amnesty! There are some questions to be asked and\nsome questions to be answered, that is all. No one will be hurt, you have my\nword, the word of Superior Pike and the word of Crown Prince Orso\nhimself. There is soup for you all a little further on.”\nThat was what it came to. You might die, but you might get soup. Shame\nwas, it more or less worked on Broad.\n“Got to trust ’em,” he muttered. “We’ve come too far now.”\n“We could head back,” hissed Liddy, forehead creased with worry.\n“They’d see us, think we’ve something to hide.

But there was nothing Broad could do. Dive from the column to\ngrab her, he’d only make it worse.\nOne of the Practicals blocked her path, stick gripped tight in his fists.\n“Get back with the others, girl.”\n“I am Savine dan Glokta!” she called in a ringing voice that seemed to\ncarry for miles in the still evening. “Daughter of His Eminence the Arch\nLector! I demand to speak to Crown Prince Orso at once!”\nThere was a pause while the Inquisitor stared at her. While the Practicals\nstared at her. While everyone stared at her, Broad included. He couldn’t\nbelieve it. After all they’d done for her, she’d land them on the scaffold.\nBut there was something different about her voice. So pure, and smooth,\nand commanding. Something different about the way she held herself,\nstiffly upright with her shoulders back, her long, thin neck stretched out and\nher sharp jaw proudly raised. She looked half a head taller of a sudden.\n“At once!” she snarled at the Inquisitor.\nHe stared at her for a moment longer, then bowed his head. “Of course.”\nThe Practical looked as dumbstruck as a man could with a mask on.\n“We’re just going to—”\n“If this young lady is who she claims to be then she deserves our\nimmediate assistance. If she is not… we’ll soon find out. And the world\nfeels like a brighter place if you believe in people’s fundamental honesty.”\nHe offered his hand with extravagant politeness.\n“Thank you, Inquisitor,” she said. “These three are with me.”\nThe Inquisitor gave Broad a doubtful look up and down. “I cannot\nexempt everyone—”\n“Of course not,” said Ardee. Or Savine. Or whoever the hell she was.\n“Just these three. I must insist.”\n“Very well.” The Inquisitor beckoned them to follow. Broad looked at\nLiddy, but what could she do? What could any of them do?\n“Better hope that girl’s telling the truth,” the Practical growled in\nBroad’s ear as he followed them up the road through the gathering darkness.\n“I’m surprised as you are,” muttered Broad, then nearly bit his tongue as\nthe man shoved him and his boot caught in a rut. He was sorely tempted to\npunch him in the head, but it would only have got him killed and perhaps\nhis family, too. Fighting every fight you’re offered doesn’t make you a big\nman, it makes you a fool.\n“Did you know about this?” he hissed out of the corner of his mouth at\nMay.\n“’Course I did.

I arranged it.”\n“You bloody what?”\nLiddy was staring at her from the other side. “What did you do, May?”\n“What I had to.” May stared straight ahead, jaw muscles working on the\nside of her face. “It’s high time someone put this family first.”\nThe New Woman\nS\navine chewed at her cracked lips. She fussed at the frayed hems of the\nhorrible, over-starched dress they had given her. She picked at the peeling\nskin around her broken fingernails.\nShe used to take such particular care over her hands. Their elegance had\noften been commented upon. Now, however she tugged at her sleeves, there\nwas no hiding the scabs, cracks, callouses. All she had been through, cut\ninto her crooked fingers.\nShe was no longer Ardee, the little lost waif. But she certainly was not\nSavine dan Glokta, feared and fearless scorpion-queen of investors. She\nused to be drawn to her reflection like a bee to a bloom. Now she shunned\nthe mirror, dreading what she might see there. But then, she dreaded\neverything.\nShe knew she should have felt overwhelming relief to no longer be\nhungry. Joy to finally be clean. Blubbing gratitude for all the unlikely\nchances that had led to her salvation. She knew few who had been trapped\nin Valbeck were anywhere near so fortunate.\nBut all she felt was a constant, nagging terror. More like a hostage taken\nthan a prisoner freed. As bad as when she fled through the crazed streets of\nValbeck on the day of the uprising. Worse, because then fear had made\nsense. Now, she was supposed to be safe.\nShe heard voices outside and spun, heart suddenly pounding. On some\nsluggish instinct from long ago, she thought of arranging herself to best\nadvantage. A lady of taste should always be discovered in the midst of\nsomething more important. She reached up to adjust her wig, realised there\nwas nothing there but her own shapeless, graceless, colourless fuzz. She\nended up frozen, less a beauty arranged for a portrait, more a burglar\nsurprised in a darkened hallway, one scabbed hand twisting the other as\nsomeone ripped the flap aside and ducked into the tent.\nOrso.\nThe red and gold of his uniform looked impossibly vivid. In Valbeck,\ntowards the end, everything had been the colour of dirt. He looked\nweightier than he used to. Or perhaps she was so used to seeing everyone\nfamished that the merely well fed looked like members of another species.\nHe had the strangest expression when he saw her. Horror? Pity? Disgust?\nHe gave a kind of shudder and put a hand over his eyes, as though the sight\nof her was painful.\n“It is you,” he whispered. “Thank the Fates.” He took a step towards her\nbut stopped awkwardly mid-stride. “Are you… hurt?”\n“No.” They both knew she was lying, and not even with any conviction.\nShe was mauled inside and out. She was torn apart and badly stitched back\ntogether.\n“Good.” He forced a crooked smile. “You look well.”"

She was a wretched understudy,\nkicked from the wings onto the empty stage and gazing horrified towards\nthe crowd, not knowing her lines. Not even knowing the play.\nWhen she finally spoke, it was a shock how calm she sounded. “There\nwere some people with me. A family. I wouldn’t have—”\n“They are safe and cared for. You don’t have to worry about anything.”\n“Not worry,” she whispered. She was nothing more than a sheaf of\nworries, held together by a shitty dress. “I’m sorry… you had to come\nhere,” she managed to dredge up. “I know how much… you wanted to go\nNorth.”\n“When I heard you were in danger, I didn’t think twice. I didn’t think\nonce. Not that your father or mine were going to give me any choice.\nProbably best I leave the North to men’s men like Leo dan Brock. I think\nwe can all agree I’m not really cut out to be a soldier.”\n“The uniform suits you.”\n“I may be a sheep on the battlefield, but when it comes to wearing the\nuniforms, I’m an absolute tiger.”\nThere had been a time she could talk for hours and beautifully say\nnothing. Now it felt obscene. Swapping light-hearted pleasantries while one\nparty is shitting themselves all over the floor.\nShe felt an entirely unreasonable stab of fury. Why hadn’t he come\nsooner? Why had he sat out here waiting, the useless fucking coward? She\nwanted to tear at him with her nails. Instead, she vomited up compliments.\n“From where I stand, it seems you managed the whole business rather\nwell.”\n“More by luck than skill, I rather think.”\n“Everyone’s alive.” A flash of blood spattering that guard’s face as his\narm was dragged into the grinding gears. Savine had to cough, swallow\nacid. “Most. Most are.”\n“You are. That’s all that matters. I’m so sorry it took me so long. To get\nhere. To find you.” He looked into her eyes with an intensity she could not\nstand to meet. “To realise… what I feel for you. I don’t see how things can\ncarry on between us… the way they did before.”\nShe almost laughed at that. “Of course not.” How could anything be\nwhat it was before, ever again?\n“That’s why…” He looked ridiculously nervous. Crown Prince Orso,\nnotorious for caring about nothing. How many women had he disappointed?\nHundreds, most likely. He really should have learned to do it better.\n“That’s why…” He took a hard breath. As if readying himself for some\ngreat act of courage. Savine lifted her chin. As if to give the headsman an\neasier task. He looked up at her. Guilty. Haunted. Ashamed.\nHer patience snapped. “Just spit it out!”"

It took this to make me realise,\nbut… hear me out.”\nHonestly, she had no words to interrupt him with.\n“I’m shit without you! Utter shit, everyone knows it.

As his queen.\n“I…” she breathed, but her voice failed her utterly and it came out no\nmore than an acrid burp.\n“Shit.” He winced as he sharply stood. “You don’t have to answer. You\ndon’t even have to think about it.” He pulled one hand away, but clung on\nwith the fingertips of the other as if he could not quite bring himself to let\ngo. “I shouldn’t have asked.

But\nshe had never imagined she might be able to trust him. To rely on him. She\nhad been braced for rejection and disappointment. Sympathy and support\nshe had no idea what to do with.\n“Shit,” he said, finally letting go of her fingers, leaving them strangely\ntingling. “I’m terrible at this. Is there something you need? Is there\nanything I can… Do you want to be alone? Do you want me to go?” He\nturned towards the tent flap.\nShe caught his wrist. It was trembling.

Their chins knocked painfully.\nThen their noses. She tried to twist her head to one side and he went the\nsame way, then they both went the other.\nShe caught his head, gripped it with both hands, teeth scraping, ugly\ngrunting, undignified slurping. Awkward and fierce and urgent, as if they\nwere running out of time. Nothing like the neat routines they used to go\nthrough in Sworbreck’s office, with all the polite back and forth of a formal\ndance, a dignified game in which they both kept their cards close. Now\neverything was on the table and it felt deadly serious, her heart thudding in\nher ears just as it had the day of the uprising.\nShe saw his bed behind a curtain, brass gleaming in the shadows, and\nshe pushed him towards it. He blundered into a stove, still trying to kiss her,\nnearly fell right over it, then got tangled with the curtain until she tore it out\nof the way. How many people knew she was in here? How many might\nguess what was happening? She didn’t care.\nAll the elaborate precautions she used to follow. The carefully laid\nalibis, the changes of carriage, the blinds lowered in Sworbreck’s bloody\noffice. Against her father finding out. Against his parents finding out.\nAgainst her ending up carrying a bastard. She had been so formidably\norganised. So overpoweringly sensible. Romance totted up and tallied in\nZuri’s book like a manufactory’s accounts.\nNow all she could think of was how easily she could have died in\nValbeck. Beaten to death. Starved to death. Burned to death. Ripped apart\nby her own machines. Manners, and propriety, and reputation, and good\nsense… none of that seemed to matter beside the necessity to tear off this\nsack of a dress and have his skin against hers. Her face was wet. She might\nhave been crying. She didn’t care.\nShe twisted around so he could get at the fastenings. “Get this thing off\nme.”\n“Doing my best,” he muttered, fumbling at her collar. “Fucking… damn\nit!” A ripping of stitches, a tap and rattle as buttons bounced away and she\ntore her arms free of the sleeves, dragged it down, wriggled out of it like a\nsnake wriggling from its unwanted skin. She kicked it away, cheap\npetticoats and all, making the canvas wall of the tent flap and rustle.\nThere had been times, in Sworbreck’s office, when she had not got as far\nas taking her hat off before they were done. Now she stood stark naked.\nUncovered, unguarded. His hands were on her waist. Fingertips scarcely\nbrushing her skin. As if he hardly dared touch her. She could hear his\nbreath.

Savine had always felt nothing but contempt for\nreading that nonsense, and here she was actually doing it. She didn’t care.\nHe paused a moment, ragged breath tickling her ear. “Are you sure you\nwant to—”\n“Yes, I’m fucking sure.” She reached behind to twist her fingers in his\nhair, twist his head down so she could kiss him over her shoulder, suck at\nhis tongue. Clumsy, hungry, mouth-crushing kisses while her other hand\nstruggled with his belt buckle behind her back, digging at it, twisting at it,\nfinally dragging it clinking free. He gave a little gasp as she pulled his\ntrousers open, found his cock, started to rub it, wrist painfully twisted.\n“Damn it,” he gasped, fumbling with the buttons on his jacket.\n“Bloody… uniforms.”\nWhen he finally ripped his shirt off, she closed her eyes at the warmth of\nhis bare chest against her bare back, his arm slipping around her ribs,\nholding her tight against him, skin pressed to skin. His other hand slid back\ndown between her legs again and she rubbed herself against it, backwards\nand forwards. She slipped one knee up onto the bed, clumsy, off balance,\nalmost falling, had to grip the bedstead with one hand, the other still\nrubbing at his prick, feeling the end prod wetly against her backside.\nNo ambitions or manipulations. No fretting on what happened yesterday\nor what would come tomorrow. Just his breathless grunts and her whimpery\nmoans, eyes closed and mouth open. By the Fates, she sounded like a cat\ncrying to be let in. She didn’t care.\nShe let go of everything.\nLost Causes\n“Y\nou can go,” said Vick.\nThe Practical’s eyes slid over to the prisoner, sly and cruel and very\nnarrow. She wondered if they were trained to use their eyes that way, or if\nonly people with a naturally threatening glare wanted to work as Practicals\nin the first place. Bit of both, maybe.\n“I think I can handle him,” she said. The prisoner’s wrists were shackled\nbehind his back, after all, and chained to the chair for good measure, the\nbag over his head shifting as he breathed.\nThe door shut, and Vick took the bag by one corner and dragged it off.\nShe’d liked Malmer from the moment she met him. She’d never have\nadmitted it, because it could have become a weakness to exploit. But she\nliked him a lot. Respected him. Reckoned he was as close as men got to\nbeing good. So it hurt, his wounded look as he recognised her. But a look\nwas all it was. Vick had met kicks and sticks and knives with a smile, and\nsome of them from people she’d liked. A hurt look wouldn’t shift her\nresolve any more than a breeze would shift a mountain. Or so she told\nherself."

Would’ve picked\nyou last of all.”\n“That’s my job,” she said as she dropped into the chair opposite.\n“Well, you’re damn good at it. Hope you’re proud.”\n“I’m not ashamed. Folk who keep hold of baggage like shame and pride\ndon’t last a week in the camps.”\n“That much was true, then?”\n“My family died there.

After what you’ve\nbeen through?”\n“You’ve got it backwards.” Vick leaned towards him. “After what I’ve\nbeen through, how could I not work for these bastards now?”\nMalmer’s shoulders sagged. “We were promised amnesty. Is that true, at\nleast?”\n“That’s true. But you must’ve known there’d be questions.” She looked\nhim full in the face, so she could judge every twitch or tick or movement of\nhis eyes. So she could sense the truth. “Where’s Risinau?”\nHe gave a weary sigh. “I don’t know.”\n“Where’s Judge?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Just give me something I can give them. Help me help you.”\n“You think I wouldn’t hand over Judge if I could?” Malmer gave a sad\nchuckle. “I’d cheer at her bloody hanging, the mad witch.”\nThe answers she’d known she’d get. But the questions still had to be\nasked. “Who’s the Weaver?”\n“That’s what Risinau called himself, when we first met.”\n“When was that?”\n“I was arrested for agitating. Five years ago. Maybe six. All we did was\nband together to ask for a fair wage, but I got the blame. Seems I’ve a talent\nfor that. Risinau came to me. In a room like this one. Said he saw things our\nway. Said he wanted to help. Strike a blow for the common man, that’s what\nhe said. Bring a Great Change.” Malmer curled his lip. “Guess I believed\nwhat I wanted to. Guess I’ve a talent for that, too.”\n“Most of us do,” said Vick. “You know what I think?”\n“If I did, I might not be in this chair.”\n“Risinau was a fool. He might’ve presided over the chaos, but there’s no\nway he planned that uprising.” She eased a little closer, as if she was\nsharing her secrets rather than winkling his out. Nothing to make people\ntrust you like pretending you trust them. “He said the Weaver was a name\nhe borrowed from someone else. Someone who set him on this path.”\nIt was thin, she knew. Nothing that might convince His Eminence there\nwas some deeper conspiracy. But Vick had never been able to leave a loose\nthread dangling.\n“What do you owe Risinau?” she asked. “He used you all. A blow for\nthe common man? Don’t make me laugh. Who’s the Weaver?”\nMalmer was frowning down at the tabletop. As if she’d made him think."

As if she’d made him think.\nAs if he was picking through the past, trying things different ways. Then he\nblinked and sat back with a grunt, as if he’d suddenly made them fit.\n“There was a man, at the first big meeting I went to. Risinau was so…\nrespectful of him. Awestruck, almost. Like a priest who’d had God turn up\nto his service. Risinau pointed him out while he was talking. Called him the\nfounder of the feast. The reason we were all there. But he didn’t say a thing.\nJust watched.”\n“Who was it?” growled Vick. She could taste the answer, dangling right\nin front of her.\n“Never heard his name,” said Malmer. “Never really saw his face, but\n—”\nThere was a clatter as the doorknob turned and Vick twisted around,\nready to snap at the Practical to get out. The words never left her lips.\nSuperior Pike stood in the doorway, his burned face expressionless, two\nPracticals at his shoulders, even crueller glares than usual above their\nmasks.\n“Well, well,” he said in a papery whisper, stepping into the narrow\nroom. “This is cosy.”\nThe legs of Vick’s chair screeched as she stood. “Superior Pike. An\nhonour.”\n“The honour is very much mine. That was remarkable work in Valbeck,\nInquisitor. Both subtle and bold. Both cunning and courageous. Without\nyou, this uprising might have had a far bloodier ending. But I should not be\nsurprised. His Eminence has always had the trick of picking the right person\nfor a job.”\nVick humbly bowed. “You’re too kind, Superior.”\n“Not many people would agree with you on that score,” said Pike, his\neyes shifting to Malmer.\n“This man was one of the leaders of the uprising. I was asking him some\nquestions about its origins.”\n“I thought we had our wayward colleague Superior Risinau to blame for\nthat?”\n“Possibly.” Vick left it there. Never use more words when fewer will do\nthe trick.\n“I would love to watch you work. There are few people from whom I\ncould learn something about interrogation.” Pike gave a sorry sigh. “But\nHis Eminence wants you to return to Adua. He wishes to congratulate you\npersonally.”\n“It’s really no trouble to—”\n“Enjoy your rest.” Pike laid a hand on her shoulder. The very lightest of\ntouches, but it still made her skin tingle unpleasantly. “No one could say\nyou have not earned it. I will uncover all that can be uncovered.” And one\nof the Practicals placed a heavy box on the table, instruments rattling inside.\n“Trust me.”\nVick glanced back at Malmer. Once, in the camps, while they were\ndragging logs across a frozen lake, a convict had fallen through the ice.\nAnother two had slid on their bellies to the hole, hoping to drag them from\nthe water. They’d gone through, too.\nIf you want to survive, you’d better get a good sense for lost causes.\nThen you’d better let them go. Let them go before you go down with them."

And no bloody apologising for himself this time! Would Savine\napologise for herself? Never!\nThe tent flap was ripped rudely aside and Hildi came stomping in,\nleaving a trail of muddy bootprints across the groundsheet.\n“Morning, Hildi!”\nShe appeared to be a great deal less pleased with him than he was, not\neven glancing in his direction as she dragged a great basket of wood\nsullenly to the stove.\n“Wonderful day, isn’t it?”\nOrso’s mother had made him bloodhound sensitive to the particular\ncharacter of punishing silences, and Hildi’s was beginning to feel serious.\nShe threw back the door of the stove with a bang and started shoving logs\ninto it as though they were knives and the stove a despised enemy.\n“Something bothering you, by any chance?”\n“Oh no, Your Highness,” her high voice close to outright collapse under\nthe weight of sarcasm.\n“And yet I sense the slightest frisson of hostility. Grievances are like a\ndrunkard’s bed, Hildi. Always better aired.”\nAs she turned towards him, he was taken aback by her look of violent\nhostility. “I defended you! When folk laughed! I spoke up for you!”\n“I… appreciate your support?” ventured Orso, baffled.\n“You bloody knew this would happen!”\nHe swallowed, a sense of profound dread beginning to creep up his\nthroat. “What would happen?”\nShe raised a trembling hand to point towards the flap, beyond which the\nsound of hammering and raised voices seemed to have taken on a suddenly\nsinister air. “This!”\nOrso pulled his dressing gown about him and ducked into the chilly\nmorning.\nOnce his eyes had adjusted to the brightness, everything looked rather\nordinary. Officers enjoying their breakfast. Soldiers warming their hands at\na fire. Others striking a tent as they prepared for the journey back to Adua.\nA smith some way off was hammering away at some wrought iron. No\nmassacre, plague or famine that he was responsible for, as far as he could—\nHe froze. A tall pole, almost a mast, had been erected beside the road\ninto Valbeck, a gib sticking sideways from the top. From the gib hung a\ncylindrical cage. In the cage was a man. A dead man, clearly, his legs\ndangling. A few curious crows were already gathering in the branches of a\ntree nearby.\nAn officer saluted him with a hearty, “Your Highness!” and Orso could\nnot even bring himself to acknowledge it. He wanted very much not to\napproach the gibbet but he had no choice, the camp mud cold on his bare\nfeet as he picked his way closer.\nTwo Practicals held the base of the pole while another thumped down\nthe earth around it with a great mallet.

A large wagon was drawn up beside\nthem. On the wagon were more poles. Twenty? Thirty? Superior Pike stood\nbeside it, frowning at a large map, pointing something out to the driver.\n“Oh no.” Orso’s guts weighed heavier with every step, as though they\nmight suddenly tear free and drop out of his arse. “Oh no, no, no.”\nThe cage creaked as it turned slowly towards him, displaying its\noccupant, his face awfully slack behind tangled grey hair. Malmer. The man\nwho had led the Breakers. The man to whom Orso had promised amnesty.\n“What the fuck have you done?” he screeched, at no one in particular. A\nfool’s question. The answer could scarcely have been more obvious. Their\nwhole purpose was to make it as obvious as they possibly could.\n“We are gibbetting two hundred of the ringleaders at quarter-mile\nintervals along the road from Valbeck,” droned Pike, as though Orso’s\ndespairing shriek had been a straightforward request for information\nwithout the slightest emotional element. As though the issue was the precise\npositioning of the corpses, not that there were any.\n“Well…stop, damn it!” frothed Orso, his majesty somewhat dimmed by\nhaving to hold his dressing gown up like a lady’s skirts above the road\nmuck. “Fucking stop!”\nOne of the Practicals paused halfway through swinging his hammer, a\nquestioning brow raised at the Superior.\n“Your Highness, I fear I cannot.” And Pike nodded the man on, the\nhammer tap, tap, tapping at the nail. The Superior slid out a weighty-\nlooking document, several signatures scrawled at the bottom, a great red\nand gold seal attached which Orso recognised immediately as his father’s.\n“These are the express and specific orders of His Eminence the Arch Lector,\nbacked by all twelve chairs on the Closed Council. Stopping now would do\nno good in any case. The two hundred traitors have already confessed and\nbeen executed. All that remains is to display them.”\n“Without trial?” Orso’s voice had gone terribly shrill. Hysterical, almost.\nHe tried to bring it under control and failed entirely. “Without process?\nWithout—”\nNow Pike turned his lashless, loveless eyes on him. “Your father has\ngranted the Inquisition extraordinary powers to examine, try and execute\nthe perpetrators of this rebellion at once. His edict countermands your\nfeelings, Your Highness, or mine, or, indeed, anyone’s.”\n“But I fear there was never really an alternative.” Yoru Sulfur was lying\non the back of the wagon, perfectly at ease among the hanging posts with\none hand behind his head. His highly specific diet evidently allowed fruit,\nas he had a half-eaten apple in the other. He had different-coloured eyes,\nOrso noticed as he gazed up calmly at the gibbet, one blue, one green. “I\nhave seen many cases like this and, take my word for it, justice must fall\nlike lightning. Swift and merciless.”\n“Lightning rarely strikes those who deserve it,” grated Orso."

        "text": "have seen many cases like this and, take my word for it, justice must fall\nlike lightning. Swift and merciless.”\n“Lightning rarely strikes those who deserve it,” grated Orso.\n“Who among us is entirely innocent?” Sulfur bared his teeth to take a\nbite from his apple and thoughtfully chewed. “Could you really have let\nthese Breakers go? To scatter to the winds and spread chaos across the\nUnion? To foment further uprisings? To teach the lesson that murder, riot\nand treason are small matters, hardly to be remarked upon and certainly not\npunished?”\n“I promised them amnesty,” muttered Orso, his voice getting weaker\nwith every syllable.\n“You said what had to be said to bring this unfortunate episode to a\nclose. To ensure stability. A stable Union means a stable world, my master\nis always saying.”\n“You cannot be held to your word by traitors, Your Highness,” added\nPike.\nOrso winced at the mud. He realised his cock was still painfully trapped\nbehind his belt and hooked a surreptitious thumb through his dressing gown\nto let it flop loose, all trace of morning magnificence entirely wilted.\nSulfur’s arguments were proving hard to disagree with. Ruling a great\nnation seemed a much more complex business than it had a few moments\nago in the privacy of his tent. And what could he do about it anyway?\nUnhang the Breakers? His useless anger was already guttering out, replaced\nby equally useless guilt.\n“What will people think of me?” he whispered.\n“They will think that, like Harod and Casamir and the great kings of old,\nyou are a man who does what must be done!” Sulfur nibbled away at the\ncore of his apple and wagged a finger. “Mercy is an admirable quality in\nsmallfolk, but I fear it does not keep kings in power.”\n“Feel free to use me as the villain again,” added Pike. “I must accept\nthat I am somewhat typecast.” He bowed stiffly. “And now please excuse\nme, Your Highness, there is a great deal to be done. You should return to\nAdua with all speed. Your father will be keen to congratulate you.”\nSulfur stripped his apple to the stalk and flicked it away, lazing back in\nthe gibbet’s shadow with one hand behind his curly head. “I don’t doubt\nyou will have made him very proud. My master, too.”\nFather would be very proud. Not to mention this fool’s master. One of\nMalmer’s trouser legs had ridden up to show his calf, grey hairs on the pale\nskin stirring faintly with the wind. One eye was closed, but the other\nseemed to peer down in Orso’s direction. He had heard it said that dead men\nhave no opinions, but this one appeared to hold an exceptionally low one of\nOrso even so. Almost as low as he did himself.\n“Not quite the end to our adventure we were hoping for.” Tunny had\nwalked up, a steaming cup of tea in one hand. “But it’s an end, I suppose.”\nOrso was not sure he had ever liked the man less than at that moment.\n“Why didn’t you get me?” he grated out.\n“It was my impression that you were otherwise engaged.” Tunny cleared\nhis throat significantly. “And what good would it have done?”"

Above, the gibbet groaned and Malmer\nturned slowly away.\nOrso the Merciful, might the historians call him, looking back\nadmiringly on his achievements?\nIt did not seem likely.\nTwo of a Kind\n“H\now are you?”\nLeo winced as he stretched out his injured leg. “Still a bit sore.”\n“It could have been far worse.”\nHe winced again as he pressed at the cut in his side. “No doubt.”\nHis mother reached up and brushed his bandaged cheek gently with her\nthumb. “I fear you’ll have some scars, Leo.”\n“Warriors should, don’t you think? In the North they call them Naming\nWounds.”\n“I think we’ve had our fill of Northern customs over the last few days.”\n“A break wouldn’t hurt.” Leo took a long breath. “Rikke hasn’t been to\nsee me.”\n“The outcome of the duel did not please her.”\n“She’d rather I’d died?”\n“She’d rather Nightfall had. She was quite vocal on that point.”\n“She’s quite vocal on every bloody point,” grumbled Leo. Rikke might\nseem an ever-gushing spring of laughs but he was starting to see there was a\nwell of deep grudges beneath. “And what do you think?”\n“I think you spared Nightfall because you have a big heart.”\n“Meaning I have a little brain?”\n“Stolicus said to kill an enemy is cause for relief. To make a friend of\nhim is cause for celebration.” Her eyes met his. That look she had when she\nwanted him to learn a lesson. “If you could make a friend of the Great\nWolf… if you could build an alliance with the North…” She let it hang\nthere.\nLeo blinked at her. “Even now you’re thinking of the next step.”\n“A runner who does not think of the next step will fall flat.”\n“If Rikke’s sore at Nightfall being alive, how’s she going to feel about\nhim being a friend?”\n“If you want to be a great lord governor, her feelings cannot dictate your\npolicy any more than mine. Or even yours. You have to do the best for the\nmost. Do you want to be a great lord governor, Leo?”\n“You know I do.”\n“The Union has been at war with the North, on and off, ever since\nCasamir took Angland. We cannot beat the Northmen with swords, Leo.\nNot for good. We will always be fighting to keep them out.” She spoke very\nsoftly. “Unless we invite them in.”\n“So… I’m a peacemaker now?”\n“You’re a fighter, like your father was.

But what separates great soldiers\nfrom mere killers is that they know when to stop fighting.”\nWincing at the pain in his side, the pain in his stomach, the pain in his\nthigh, Leo slipped his feet from the bed and swung them down onto the cold\nfloor. “Got to admit, I don’t much fancy fighting right now.”\n“I doubt we’ll keep you away from the swords for long.” Leo’s mother\nhad a dry smile as she slipped a folded paper from her sleeve. “You\nreceived a letter. A message from the king. Or from his lord chamberlain,\nanyway.”\n“Don’t tell me, they’re finally sending reinforcements.”\n“They’ve heard they don’t need to. So, naturally, they overflow with\npraise for your martial prowess.”\n“Their praise will be quite the salve on my wounds, I’m sure.”\n“They offer more than that,” she said, looking back to the letter. “You\nare invited to Adua for a triumph. A grand parade, to celebrate your victory\nover the Northmen! I suspect the Closed Council want the king and his son\nto bask in your reflected glory.”\nLeo rubbed at his slit shoulder through the bandages. By the dead, that\nsmarted. “You’re the one who deserves the triumph.”\n“For what? Retreating?” She put her hand on his. “You fought. You won.\nYou deserve the rewards.” She paused a moment, looking into his eyes.\n“I’m proud of you.”\nIt was as if those words were another sword-cut, and he shut his eyes,\nand felt tears stinging at the lids.\nHe’d never realised how much he wanted to hear them.\nIt wasn’t easy.\nHe walked with a stick, every step an aching effort, the Northmen\nscattered about the vale competing over who could give him the most\nthreatening glare as he struggled past. One was sharpening a sword with a\nsteady scrape, scrape, scrape that seemed to be applied directly to his raw\nnerves.\n“I’m getting the feeling they don’t like us much,” murmured Jurand\nthrough tight lips.\n“I’m getting the feeling they don’t like anyone,” whispered Glaward.\n“They don’t have to like us, as long as they don’t kill us.” Leo was\nstarting to suspect this had been a very bad idea. But it would hardly have\nbeen his first. He put his head back and tried to walk as if he was looking\nfor another duel right now.\nIt wasn’t easy. But if changing the world was easy, everyone would be at\nit.\nThere was a house down by the sluggish stream in the valley’s bottom,\nsmoke smudging from its squat chimney. A man was just ducking from the\nlow doorway, with iron-grey hair and an iron-hard frown. Leo recognised\nhim from the Circle. Black Calder. Father of Stour Nightfall, brother of\nScale Ironhand. The man who really ruled the North.\n“You’re bold to come here, Leo dan Brock.” He narrowed his eyes as\nthough he was a cat and Leo an especially reckless mouse. “Very bold or\nvery foolish.”\nLeo ventured a winning smile. “Can’t a man be both?”\nIt won nothing from Black Calder. “The two often go together, in my\nexperience. Have you come to mock my son?”\n“I’ve come to make a friend of him.”"

Have you come to mock my son?”\n“I’ve come to make a friend of him.”\nBlack Calder raised his grey brows. “Even bolder. But if you want to\nstick your head in the wolf’s jaws, who am I to stop you?”\n“Which leaves only one thing.”\n“Yes?”\nLeo nodded towards the glowering warriors. “Your men have no\nbusiness squatting on the Dogman’s land, specially with such warlike looks.\nHigh time they went back to their families and remembered how to smile.”\nBlack Calder looked at him a moment longer, then gave a snort. “Defeat\nmakes them surly.” And he stalked off.\n“You two wait here,” said Leo to his friends. He’d have liked nothing\nmore than to take them with him. But some things you have to do alone.\nIt wasn’t much different from the room where he’d been lying the last\nfew days. The sharp smell of healer’s herbs and stale sweat. The smothering\nwarmth from the overbanked fire. The one bed, the one chair. The well-used\nwar gear heaped in the corner. A reminder that the man in here had been a\nwarrior. A stubborn insistence that he would be again.\n“Well, well. The Young Lion himself come a-calling.” Stour Nightfall\nlay back in a shadowed corner, bandaged leg raised on rolled blankets. His\nlip was twisted into an epic sneer, as if to make up for the bruises around\nboth eyes and the crusting of blood under his swollen nose. “The last\nbastard I expected to see at my sickbed is the bastard who put me here.”\nLeo hooked his walking stick over the back of the chair and sat down\nheavily. “A great warrior always tries to surprise.”\n“You speak good Northern.”\n“I lived a year in Uffrith, with the Dogman.”\nStour’s eyes gleamed in the half-light. Like a wolf’s eyes in the darkness\nof the forest. “And I hear you poke his scrag of a daughter.”\nLeo held his eye. “When I’m not stabbing Black Calder’s scrag of a\nson.”\nStour’s sneer grew more savage. “’Cause of your sword, they say I\nmight not walk again.”\nLeo was too sore himself to find much sympathy. It would win nothing\nhere anyway. “You’re mistaking me for someone who cares a shit,” he said.\n“I’m no nursemaid and no fucking diplomat, either. I’m a warrior. Like\nyou.”\n“You’re nothing like me.” Stour squirmed back on his mattress,\ngrimacing as he shifted his leg. “I could’ve put you in the mud a dozen\ntimes over.”\n“I daresay.”\n“I was the better swordsman, by far.”\n“I daresay.”\n“If I hadn’t made a show of it—”\n“But you did make a show of it, and you took me lightly, and you\nfucking lost.” And Leo had to admit he greatly enjoyed saying it. “Now you\nowe me your life.”\nStour clenched his fist as if he was about to strike.

Even if you do walk again. You’re not the\nonly one can learn a lesson.”\n“Then why did you come here?”\n“’Cause my mother says boys whine about what’s done. Men decide\nwhat will be.”\n“You always listen to your mother?”\n“I complain about it, but yes.” He was no diplomat, after all. Bluntness\nwould win the day, or nothing would. “She’s a very clever woman.”\n“Sounds like something my father would say.”\n“I hear he’s a very clever man.”\n“So he’s always telling me. Let’s look to the future, then,” said Stour.\n“What do you see there, Young Lion?”\nWhat indeed? Leo took a long breath. “The Bloody-Nine won ten duels\nin the Circle, but he let most of his opponents live. Rudd Threetrees. Black\nDow. Harding Grim.”\n“I know the names.”\n“He left them bound to serve.”\nStour curled his lip. “You want me to serve you?”\n“The Great Wolf for a pet?” He saw Stour’s face twist with anger, made\nhim wait a moment longer before going on. “I don’t need you for a servant.\nI want you for a friend.”\nStour gave a disbelieving snort, bursting with pride and scorn.\nEverything he did burst with pride and scorn, even though he lost. “For a\nwhat?”\n“I reckon we want the same thing, you and I.”\n“And what the fuck is that?”\n“Glory!” barked Leo, voice clapping off the narrow walls and making\nStour flinch. “You want men to whisper your name with fear. With awe.\nWith pride. You want to hear it in the songs, in the same breath as the\nBloody-Nine’s, and Whirrun of Bligh’s, and the great warriors of the age!\nYou want fame.” And Leo shook his clenched fist in Stour’s face. “Fame in\nthe Circle and fame on the battlefield! You want to strive against great\nenemies and put the bastards in the mud. You want to win!” He snapped that\nword out like a battle cry, and Stour’s face twitched at it, like a miser’s\nwho’s seen the glint of gold. “And you know how I know?” Leo smiled, or\nat any rate showed his teeth. “’Cause I do, too.”\nThe room was silent again. Just the rustle as a log shifted in the\nfireplace. Stour had turned thoughtful, eyes fixed on Leo. Two handsome\nyoung heroes at the height of their strength. A lord governor and a king-in-\nwaiting, ready to step out from the long shadows of their parents. A pair of\nchampions, men of action, already with great victories under their belts, set\nto inherit the world and reforge it the way they saw fit.\n“Maybe we understand each other after all,” Stour said softly.\n“We have to be neighbours,” said Leo, sitting forward. “We could waste"

No\nshortage of other enemies. Might do better if we fought the bastards\ntogether.”\n“It’s a pretty picture,” said the Great Wolf, eyes shining, and Leo\nwondered if he might trust the thoughtful Stour even less than the furious\none. “But do you really reckon a wolf and a lion can share the meat?”\n“If there’s enough meat to go around, why not?”\nStour slowly started to smile. “Then let’s shake on it, Young Lion.” And\nhe thrust his hand towards Leo.\nLeo wondered if he really was sticking his head in the wolf’s mouth, but\nhe’d come this far. There was no way back. So he winced as he stood,\nreaching out to take Stour’s hand.\nHe gave a gasp as the fingers snapped tight around his and he was jerked\nforward, pain lancing through his wounded side. He found himself bent\nover Stour with a dagger-blade tickling his neck.\n“Trot into the wolf’s lair talking of friendship?” Stour clicked his\ntongue. “Not very clever.”\n“No one’s ever accused me of being clever. But we’ve tried being\nenemies.” Leo reached around the blade of Stour’s knife to scratch gently at\nhis bandaged face. “Look where it’s got us.”\nThe Great Wolf bared his teeth and Leo felt the knife’s edge press\nagainst his throat, the tension in Stour’s arm as he gripped the handle tight.\n“I like you, Brock. Maybe we’re two of a kind after all.” Stour’s snarl\nbecame a grin, and he rammed the knife into the wattle wall, much to Leo’s\nrelief. “The Young Lion and the Great Wolf together.” The grin became a\nsmirk as he squeezed Leo’s hand even tighter. “There’s a partnership’ll\nmake the world tremble!”\nEmpty Chests\nT\nhe wind gusted up strong, whipping brown leaves from the trees and\nsending them chasing across the hillside, whipping Rikke’s hair in her face\nas she stood, watching Leo limp towards her with Jurand and Glaward in\ntow, silently seething.\nShe’d been seething ever since the duel, and not always silently, either.\nThree times she’d gone to the house where he was lying wounded. Three\ntimes she’d prowled around outside. Three times she’d stalked away\nwithout going in. Wanting to see him, refusing to see him. She’d been\nhoping her silence would speak in thunder, but some men are wilfully deaf.\nLeo bared his teeth as he walked, leaning hard on a stick. That sprinkled\nsome guilt on her anger.

In that, if nothing else, he was wise.\n“I’ll give you pained,” she muttered under her breath.\nDidn’t help her mood at all that, ever since the duel, she could still see\nghosts. Misty figures haunting the corners of her vision. Misty after-images\nthat followed faces. Folk preparing the Circle. Folk fighting and dying in\nthe battle. One time a fellow taking a shit in the bushes. No pattern to any\nof it that she could see. Her left eye still felt hot, her nerves raw and\nsmarting, her stomach squelching and bubbling.

The looks he gave her, anyone\nwould’ve thought it was him and Leo who were the couple. Rikke had\nmeant to be firm but fair, the way her father always told her to be, but well\nbefore Jurand was out of earshot she ended up scolding.\n“What did you and that murdering bastard have to talk about?”\nLeo sighed. “The future. Like it or not, he’ll be King of the Northmen.\nBetter we talk than fight—”\n“Is it?” snapped Rikke. “I’m surprised you didn’t stay there. Hold hands\nwhile he heals, share a few laughs over how he burned my father’s hall and\nchased me through the woods and killed my friends and yours!”\nLeo winced like he was stepping out into a storm. “I’m not changing\nsides, Rikke, I’m just trying to build a bridge from one side to the other.”\n“No doubt.

A bond. You wouldn’t understand!”\n“Because I’ve got a quim or because I’ve got a brain?”\n“My mother might treat me like a child but at least I bloody am her\nchild. I’m lord governor now!” Half-angry and half-wheedling, like he was\ntrying to convince himself as much as her. “I have to make the decisions.”\n“And your first one is to break your fucking word?”\nHe looked taken aback by how savage she sounded. Truthfully, she was\na little taken aback by it, too. “I’d no idea you could be so… ruthless.”\n“Oh, aye, Ruthless Rikke, terror of the North. Seems none of the men in\nmy life know me as well as they think. The fact is, being nice gets nothing\ndone. You have to make of your heart a stone, Leo. You should’ve killed\nhim.”\n“Maybe I should have.” Leo lifted his chin. “But I won. It was my\nchoice what to do with him.”\nBy the dead, how had it come to this between the two of them? From a\nlot of bliss and a few niggles to all niggle and no bliss at all. She guessed\nyou can only ride so far on a fine stomach. She felt a flurry of twitches\nchase up her cheek and the fact she couldn’t get her own face to obey only\nmade her angrier than ever.\n“You arrogant fuck!” she snarled. “You were reckless, and stupid, and by\nsome margin the second-best fighter out of two! You won because Stour\nwas even more of a puffed-up fool than you and couldn’t help showing off!\nYou won because my Long Eye saw what he’d do and I bloody screamed it\nat you!”\nLeo’s bruised, bandaged face barely moved while she spoke. Once she\nran out of things to hurt him with and petered off into silence, he took a\nsmall step towards her. Not angry. Not sad.\n“What did you say to me? No one remembers how the fight was won. I\nwon. No one cares how.”"

No one cares how.”\nHe brushed her shoulder as he stepped past, not quite barging her out of\nthe way, but nearly.\nWas only a day or two ago, he’d said he loved her. Seemed he shrugged\nhis loves off as easily as his promises.\nHe left her on the hillside, in the wind. Silently seething.\n“Leo dan bloody Brock,” she snarled, and in case someone had somehow\nmissed the point, added, “that preening dunce!”\nIsern thoughtfully fiddled with the finger bones on her necklace. “I sense\nsomething hath come betwixt the young lovers.”\n“You’ve an uncanny feeling for these things,” mused Rikke’s father.\n“He’s a bloody bladder o’ vanity!” snapped Rikke, rubbing at her eye.\nStill sore. Still hot.\n“You know your problem?” Her father had that calming look that was\nalways certain to enrage her more.\n“It’s Leo dan lying Brock, the faithless fucker!”\n“You’re prone to set folk up so high, all they can do is let you down…”\n“It’s a constant worry o’ mine,” said Isern, nodding away, “the way the\ngirl worships me.”\n“… and when they do, it’s a high peak to topple from.”\n“That’s not true!” snapped Rikke. Then she wondered if it was, and\nquickly lost all patience with the exercise. “That’s shit!”\n“You’ve said all along he’s prone to think of himself first, second, third\nand last,” said Isern.\n“And you’re saying that’s all right?”\n“I’m saying it’s a bastard of a shortcoming in a lover, but one your eyes\nwere wide open to. If you build your boat from cheese, d’you see, you can’t\nwail at the heavens when it sinks, for cheese is known to be a poor material\nfor boat-building.”\n“You should only ask for promises you know are going to be kept,” said\nher father. “And we’re talking of the Circle.” He gave a helpless shrug.\n“Things happen. You’ve got to try to look on the sunny side or you’ll spend\nyour life in darkness.”\nRikke ground her teeth. The two of them had, as usual, many fair points.\nBut it was unfair points she wanted right then. “So when someone kicks me\nup my arse, I need to thank ’em for not kicking me in the teeth, do I?”\n“We got our land back, Rikke. Our city. Our hall. Our garden…” His\nmouth curled up in a faraway smile. “No doubt it’ll all need some putting\nright, but—”\n“How long for, d’you think?” sneered Rikke, not much comforted by\nthoughts of training a rose or two. “Will Black Calder just toss his father’s\ndreams on the rubbish heap now, dump his ambitions with the fish skins?\nThat greedy fucker’s going nowhere. Moment we look away, he’ll be\nback!”\nHer father, as ever, refused to be goaded into anger and stuck with quiet\nresignation. “Nothing’s for ever, Rikke. No peace and no war. All you can"

All you can\ndo is the best you can in the time you’ve got.”\n“Well, there’s our answer then. Best you can! Wisdom to be proud of.”\nAll that dug from him was a wistful wince. “Wish I had some wisdom to\ngive you. Wish I had the answers.”\nRikke felt guilty, then. She seemed to lately, whenever she wasn’t angry.\nLurching from one to the other like a bloody children’s see-saw. The kind\nthat smacks you hard in the arse. “I’m sorry,” she grumbled. “You’ve given\nme plenty of wisdom. More answers than any child’s got a right to. Ignore\nme.” She couldn’t resist adding, “Everyone bloody does,” in a mumble at\nthe end.\n“Well, your faithless but finely proportioned lord governor problem is\nsolving itself.” Isern leaned back and put one boot up on the table, rolling a\nchagga pellet between finger and thumb. “Since he’s off to the Union where\nthe bloated fools who wouldn’t lift a finger to help will call him the greatest\nwarrior since Euz, and puff his head up with farts until he can’t fit through a\nbloody door sideways.”\n“Huh.” Rikke neatly swiped the chagga pellet as Isern lifted it to her\nmouth and stuck it up behind her own lip. “Some solution.”\n“Thought you hated him?”\n“I do.”\n“But you don’t want him to go anywhere?” asked Isern, rolling a new\npellet for herself.\nRikke planted her elbows on the table and her chin on her hands and\nsagged unhappily into them. “Exactly.”\nHer father swiped the second pellet from Isern’s fingers and stuck it\ndown behind his own lip. “Just as well you’re going with him, then.”\nRikke looked up. “I’m going where now?”\n“Adua.”\n“I need to go back to Uffrith, with you. Tend to the garden, and\nwhatever.” Though she’d never had much patience for it, and less than ever\nthese days.\n“Isern and Shivers’ll go with you, make sure you don’t get into\nmischief.”\n“Or that you do?” muttered Isern, eyeing them both carefully as she\nrolled a third pellet.\n“You can pour a drink on my old friend Grim’s grave.” He gave a little\nsmile. “No need for words over it. He never liked ’em. But there’ll be deals\ndone in Adua, and we need to be represented. After the battle at Osrung, we\nwere promised six chairs on the Open Council. Never happened.”\n“Promises are like flowers,” said Isern, stretching her arms wide. “Often\ngiven, rarely kept.”\n“Well, if Leo sticks by us, maybe it’ll be kept now.”\nRikke pushed her pellet sourly from one side of her lip to the other. “I\nhaven’t proved myself too good at making Leo stick to things.”\n“Try again. You might improve. And it’ll do you good to see the world."

A year in Ostenhorm had been hard\nenough work.\n“Just promise me one thing.”\n“Anything.”\n“Let go of it.”\n“Of what?”\n“The feuds,” said her father, and of a sudden, he looked so tired. “The\ngrudges. The enemies. Take it from a man with a wealth o’ bitter\nexperience. Vengeance is just an empty chest you choose to carry. One you\nhave to go bent under the weight of all your days. One score settled only\nplants the seeds of two more.”\n“So you’re telling me I should just forget what they said? Forget what\nthey did?”\n“There’s no forgetting. I’m hemmed in by the memories.” And he\nflapped an arm about as though the shadows were full of an invisible crowd.\n“Besieged by the bastards. The hurts and the regrets. The friends and the\nenemies and those who were a bit o’ both. Too long a lifetime of ’em. You\ncan’t choose what you remember. But you can choose what you do about it.\nTime comes… you got to let it all go.” He smiled sadly down at the\ntabletop. “So you can go back to the mud without the baggage.”\n“Don’t talk that way,” said Rikke, putting her hand down on the back of\nhis. She felt like she was on stormy seas and he was the one star she had to\nsail by. “You’re a long way from the mud.”\n“We’re all of us only a hair away, girl, all the time. At my age, you have\nto be ready.”\nRikke realised she’d got swept away in her bitterness then, and she\nleaned forward and hugged her father tight, and propped her chin on his\nbalding head.\n“I’ll let go of it. I promise.” But it was starting to seem like she was no\ngood at letting go.\nBehind his back, Isern tapped her fist against her heart and mouthed one\nword.\n“Stone.”\nLike Rain\n“H\nome,” said Savine as the carriage lurched to a halt. Broad never rode\nin one before and it had been a bone-shaking business. Like most luxuries,\nhe was starting to realise it was more about how it looked than how it felt.\nSavine’s home would’ve been daunting as a fortress, let alone a house.\nAn almighty box of pale stone, acres of dark windows frowning onto the\nKingsway across gardens on fire with autumn colour. It had a great porch\nwith great pillars like it was some temple of the Old Empire. It had a tower\nat one corner with slit windows and battlements. It had a pair of guardsmen\nholding ceremonial halberds, still as statues on either side of the sweeping\nmarble steps.\nBroad looked at Liddy, and swallowed, and she looked back, eyes wide,\nand neither one of them had a thing to say.

May stared at the man when he offered\nher his spotless white-gloved hand as if she was worried her fingers might\nstain it.\n“The bloody footmen look like lords,” muttered Broad.\n“One of them is a lord,” Savine threw over her shoulder.\n“Eh?”\n“I’m joking. Relax. This is your home now.” Which was easy for her to\nsay, she was stepping through her front door. Broad felt like he was sticking\nhis head into a dragon’s mouth. Though few dragons could’ve had a maw\nhalf the size of the towering front doors.\n“I don’t feel too relaxed,” he muttered to Liddy as he shuffled up the\nsteps.\n“Would sir prefer a cell in the House of Questions?” she forced through\nan unconvincing smile to one of the guards. “Or a gibbet over the road to\nValbeck?”\nBroad cleared his throat. “You’ve a point.”\n“Shut your mouth and be thankful, then.”\n“Always good advice…” The hall could’ve held a whole terrace of\nValbeck’s slum houses. A gleaming expanse of rare woods and coloured\nmarbles imported from places whose names Broad couldn’t even\npronounce, most likely, and he twitched down his worn cuffs and twitched\nup his worn collar in a pathetic effort to make himself more presentable.\nA fine-looking lady was waiting for them, dark-skinned, tall and elegant,\nwith hands clasped and jet-black hair knotted tight. “Lady Savine—”\nSavine stepped forward and caught her in a hug. “It’s so good to see\nyou, Zuri. I can’t tell you how good.”\nThe dark-skinned woman stood a moment, surprised, then lifted her\narms and hugged Savine back. “I am so very sorry I let you down. I kept\nthinking… if I could have been there—”\n“I’m glad you weren’t. There was nothing anyone could do. Let’s not\nspeak of it again. Let’s have everything… just as it was before.” And Savine\ngave a brittle, queasy smile, as if that might be easier said than done. Broad\nknew how that went. “Were you able to help your brothers?”\n“Thanks to you. They came back with me.” Zuri beckoned two men\nforward. Both dark-skinned like her, but otherwise they could hardly have\nbeen more different. “This is Haroon.”\nHaroon was wide as a door, bald and bearded. He touched two fingers to\nhis wide forehead, solemn as an undertaker, and spoke in about the deepest\nvoice Broad had ever heard. “We thank God for your safe return, Lady\nSavine.”\n“And this is Rabik.”\nRabik couldn’t have been much older than May, slight and bright-eyed,\nglossy black hair to his collar. He gave a quick little bow, lots of teeth in an\neasy smile. “And we thank you for this refuge from the chaos in the South.”\n“I am very glad to have you with us,” said Savine.\n“Your mother would like to see you, of course,” said Zuri, “and there is"

Bath, Mother, book, in that order.”\n“I will be up to help dress you as soon as your friends are settled. I…\ntook the liberty of hiring a new face-maid.”\nSavine swallowed. “Of course. And could you get me some pearl dust,\nZuri? I need… a little something.”\nZuri squeezed her hand. “Already waiting for you.”\nBroad watched Savine sweep away up the stairs. They were wide\nenough she could’ve been driven straight up them in the carriage. His eye\nwas caught by the chandelier. Nearly blinded by its glittering, in fact. An\nupside-down mountain of twinkling Visserine glass. Dozens of candles, and\neach a fine ten-bit wax candle, too. He wondered what it cost to make.\nWondered what it cost just to light each evening.\n“You must be the Broads.”\nZuri was studying him, no longer so welcoming, her black eyes hard and\ncautious. Broad couldn’t blame her. He and Liddy had lost the power of\nspeech altogether. Fell to May to speak up for the family. That seemed to\nhappen more and more.\n“I’m May, these are my parents Liddy and Gunnar.” She raised her chin\nin a little gesture of defiance which made Broad feel strangely proud. “We\nlooked after Lady Savine in Valbeck. Made sure she was safe.”\n“She and her parents will be extremely grateful. And no one ever did\nthis family a favour or a wrong without being repaid triple. I understand\nyou will be joining Lady Savine’s service?”\n“We’d like to,” said Liddy.\n“She will make you work. She makes everyone work.”\n“Never been afraid of work,” said May.\n“The Prophet says it is the best way into heaven, after all.” She said it\nwith a funny sort of smile, as if she wasn’t near so pious as the words\nimplied, and led them through into a seemingly endless corridor. No\ngleaming marble, just whitewashed plaster and bare boards, but all orderly\nand smelling of soap. Even back here, Broad still felt a bit out of his class.\nA pair of girls walked past with armfuls of laundry, looking nervously at\nthem as if they were animals got free of their cage. Maybe they were.\n“How many servants are there?” asked May.\n“Nineteen in this house, and twelve guardsmen.”\nLiddy’s eyes were nearly as wide as Broad’s must’ve been. “How many\nhouses does she have?”\n“This is the townhouse of Lady Savine’s father, His Eminence the Arch\nLector. Lady Savine spends much of her free time here, though she has very\nlittle.” Zuri glanced quickly at a watch she wore on a chain around her neck\nand slightly upped the pace. “But she owns five houses of her own also.\nOne in Adua which she uses for meetings of the Solar Society and other"

In her various business ventures, well… hundreds.\nThousands, maybe.”\n“What business is she in?” croaked Broad as they turned up a long\nstaircase.\n“It might be better to ask what business she isn’t in. What experience do\nyou have?”\n“I can stitch,” said Liddy. “Was assistant to a dressmaker once. I can\nwash, I can cook some.”\n“Lady Savine will always find work for someone who can use a needle.\nHer wardrobe provides labour for legions on its own.” She turned a key and\nled them into a room flooded with light. Trees whispered in the breeze\noutside the three big windows, yellow leaves gently falling. Through one\ndoorway, Broad could see a big old bed frame. He was wondering if they\nwere there to clean the place when she held the key out to him. “You can\nuse these rooms for now. Until we find you something better.”\n“Better?” muttered Broad, staring at a vase of fresh flowers on a fine old\ntable. He’d always thought himself unfortunate. Now he wondered what\nhe’d done to deserve all the luck. Why was he standing in these clean-\nsmelling rooms while crows pecked at the corpses of better men on the road\nto Valbeck? All he could think was that deserving’s got nothing to do with\nanything. Life just falls on you, like rain.\n“What role did you see yourself occupying, Master Broad?”\nBroad pushed his lenses up his nose and slowly shook his head. “Never\nsaw myself occupying anything in a house like this one. I was working in a\nbrewery, my lady—”\nZuri smiled. “No need to call me that. I am Lady Savine’s companion.”\n“I thought you were friends,” said May.\n“We are. But if I ever forgot that I am also her servant and she is also my\nmistress, we would not stay friends for very long.” She looked to Broad\nagain. “What else?”\n“My family were herders, going way back.” She didn’t care about that.\nHe hardly even cared about that any more, it felt like a thousand years ago.\n“And… I was in the army… for a while.”\nZuri’s eyes came to rest on the tattooed back of his hand. “You have\nseen action?”\nBroad swallowed. He was getting the feeling she didn’t miss much.\n“Some. In Styria.”\n“You didn’t learn anything on campaign?”\n“Nothing that’d be useful in a lady’s service.”\nZuri laughed as she turned towards the door.

Pig iron, melted to a slurry.\nValbeck was not behind her in the past, it was now, all around her.

While she powdered the freckles on her nose away to pale\nperfection, she felt as if her slit guts were unravelling across the floor. She\ncould hardly remember that easy confidence she used to have. She was an\nimpostor in her own clothes. A stranger in her own life.\n“Mother!”\n“Savine! Thank the Fates you’re safe!”\n“Thank the Broads. I’d never have made it without them.”\n“I thought you’d come straight to me when you arrived.” Her mother\nhad that familiar lecturing pout. As keen as Savine was to pretend\neverything was the same.\n“I wanted to get clean first. It seems like months since I was clean.” She\ndid not feel clean even now. However she scrubbed, the aimless dread still\nstuck to her like a clammy second skin.\n“We’ve all been so worried.” Her mother held Savine out at arm’s length\nso she could look her over. Like an owner examining the damage to a fire-\nravaged house. “Dear, dear, but you’re so thin.”\n“The food was… not good. Then the food ran out.” Savine gave a shrill\nlaugh, though nothing was at all funny. “We ate vegetable peelings. It’s\namazing how quickly you feel lucky to get them. There was a woman in the\nnext house who tried to make soup by boiling the paste off her wallpaper.\nIt… didn’t work.” She shook herself. “Could I get a drink, Mother? I\nneed… a little something.” She would much rather have been held but,\nsince they were who they were, she could be drunk instead.\n“You know I never turn down a drink before lunch.” Her mother flicked\nopen the cabinet and began to pour. “Lubricates the rough road through to\nafternoon.” She handed Savine a glass, and she knocked it off right away\nand handed it back.\nHer mother raised a brow. “You do need lubricating.”\n“It was…” Savine felt tears gathering in her eyes as she tried to put into\nwords what it had been. Crawling through the grinding engines. Running\nthrough a city gone insane.

So little resistance. The look on his\nface. So surprised. “Just a little time…” The grinding, ripping, screaming as\nthe guard’s arm was dragged into the gears of that machine. “To adjust.”\nShe drained her glass again. Shook herself free of Valbeck again. Forced\nthe smile back onto her face. Again. “Mother, I… have some news.”\n“Bigger news than that you’re alive?”\n“In some ways, yes.” Certainly Queen Terez would think so…\n“Is it bad?” asked her mother, wincing.\n“No, no. It’s good.” She thought. “It’s very good.” She hoped.\n“Mother… I’ve received a proposal of marriage.”\n“Another? How many is that now?”\n“This time I’m going to accept.” What man could suit her better, after\nall? What man could offer her more?\nHer mother’s eyes went very wide. “Bloody hell.” She finished her glass\nwith one long swallow. “Are you sure? Given what you’ve been through—”\n“I’m sure.” It was the one thing she was sure about. “What I’ve been\nthrough… only made me realise… how sure I am.” Orso was the one thing\nthat made sense, and the sooner she was back in his arms, the better.\n“But surely I’m not old enough to have a married daughter?” Savine’s\nmother snorted up a laugh as she went to the table and pulled the stopper\nfrom the decanter. “So… who’s the luckiest bastard in the Union?”\n“That’s the thing. It’s… well…”\n“Have you fallen for someone unsuitable, Savine?” Wine gurgled out\ninto the glass. “Marrying down isn’t the worst thing in the world, you know,\nyour father did it—”\n“It’s Crown Prince Orso!” Her mother’s head jerked up, her glass, for\nonce, forgotten in her hand. Savine had to admit it sounded absurd. The\nmost unlikely part of some unlikely fantasy. She cleared her throat and\nlooked at the floor, went halting on. “It seems that… in due course… I’m\ngoing to be Queen of the Union.”\nAnd she had to admit it felt fine to say it.

You just want his position. That’s no foundation for a\nmarriage, you must see that—”\nLectures on the proper foundation for a marriage? From her?

She gave a girlish giggle which\nwas quite unlike her. “We’re in love.” Fates help her, she wanted to sing it\nand dance around the room like a child. “We’re in love!”\nHer mother was not dancing. She had turned positively ghostly. Now she\nsank down in a chair, one hand to her mouth. “What have I done?” she\nwhispered.\n“Mother… you’re scaring me.”\n“You cannot marry Prince Orso.”\nSavine squatted in front of her. Caught her hands in hers. They were\ncold. Corpse hands. “Don’t worry. He will speak to the queen. He will\nspeak to the king. They’ve wanted him to marry for years, they’ll be\nrelieved he’s marrying a human! And if they’re not, he’ll convince them! I\nknow him. I trust him. He’ll—”\n“You cannot marry Prince Orso.”\n“I know his reputation’s bad, but he’s nothing like people think. We love\neach other. He has a good heart.” Good hearts? She was blathering but she\ncouldn’t stop herself, going nervously faster and faster. “And I have sense\nenough for both of us. We love each other. And think of all the good I can"

And think of all the good I can\ndo if—”\n“You’re not hearing me, Savine.” Her mother looked up. Her eyes were\nwet, but there was a hardness in them, too. A hardness Savine had not often\nseen. She pronounced each word with stern precision. “You cannot…\nmarry… Prince Orso.”\n“What aren’t you telling me?”\nSavine’s mother squeezed her eyes shut and a tear black with powder\nstreaked her cheek. “He’s your brother.”\n“He’s…” Savine stared, cold and prickling all over. “He’s what?”\nHer mother opened her pink-rimmed eyes. She looked calm, now. She\nslipped her hands from Savine’s, took Savine’s in hers, pressed them tightly.\n“Before the king… was the king. Before anyone guessed he’d ever be the\nking. We… he and I… were involved.”\n“What do you mean, involved?” breathed Savine. The king had always\nbehaved so strangely around her. So curious. So solicitous.\n“We were lovers.” Her mother gave a helpless shrug. “Then everyone\nfound out he was King Guslav’s bastard, and he was elected king himself\nand had to marry where politics dictated. But I… was already with child.”\nSavine was having trouble getting a proper breath. The way the king had\nlooked at her, at the last meeting of the Solar Society. That haunted look…\n“It was a dangerous time,” said her mother. “The Gurkish had just\ninvaded. Lord Brock had rebelled against the Crown. The monarchy was\nhanging by a thread. To protect me… to protect you… your father,” and she\nwinced, realising that the word could not quite fit the Arch Lector any more,\n“offered to marry me.” And she guiltily bit her lip. Like a little girl caught\nstealing biscuits.\n“I’m the king’s bastard?” Savine jerked her hands from her mother’s\ngrip.\n“Savine—”\n“I’m the king’s fucking bastard, and my father’s not my father?” She\nwobbled to her feet, stumbling back as though she’d been slapped.\n“Please, listen to me—”\nSavine pressed her fingers to her temples. Her head was throbbing. She\nripped her wig off and flung it into the corner. “I’m the king’s bastard, my\nfather’s not my father, and I’ve been sucking my brother’s cock?” she\nscreamed.\n“Keep your voice down,” hissed her mother, starting up from the settle.\n“My fucking voice?” Savine clutched at her neck. “I’m going to be\nsick.”\nShe was sick, just a little. An acrid, wine-tasting tickle that she managed\nto choke back down, hunched over.\n“I’m so sorry,” murmured her mother, patting her back as though that\nmight do the slightest good. “I’m so sorry.” She took Savine’s face in her\nhands and twisted it towards her. Twisted it with surprising firmness. “But\nyou cannot tell anyone. Not anyone. Especially not Orso.”\n“I have to tell him something,” whispered Savine."

His favourite expression. “Didn’t hear what?”\nForest let vent two perfect streams of curling smoke from his nostrils.\nHe was as accomplished a smoker as he was a hat-wearer and military\norganiser. “Our new Lord Governor of Angland, Leo dan Brock, won a duel\nagainst Stour Nightfall, son of Black Calder and heir to the throne of the\nNorth and by all accounts a most fearsome opponent.”\n“A manly duel, Northern style!” Orso thumped the table. “Man against\nman, in a Circle of men’s men! Blood on the snow and all that. Men’s\nblood, one presumes.”\n“Probably a bit far south for snow this time of year,” observed Tunny.\n“Though not for blood.”\n“Tell me he got his damn fool head split doing it,” said Yolk.\n“He was by all accounts picturesquely wounded,” grunted Orso, “but his\nskull remains intact.”\n“Truly, there’s no justice,” added Tunny.\n“This comes as a surprise?”\n“For some reason, I never stop hoping.”\n“War in the North is over,” said Forest. “Uffrith is back in the Dogman’s\nhands and the Protectorate just as it was before.”\n“Little singed, maybe.”\n“So the Young Lion stole all the glory?” moaned Yolk.\n“Glory just sticks to some men.” Orso glanced down at his hands and\nturned them thoughtfully over. “Others it slides right off.”\n“Like water off a duck,” threw in Hildi, from her place on the settle.\n“I’ve always been repellent to glory,” observed Tunny, “and have no\nregrets.”\n“No regrets?” said Orso. “What about the two hundred people we left\ngibbetted on the road to Valbeck?”\n“Not my fault.”\n“Not yours, either, Your Highness,” added Forest.\n“I suspect I will take much of the blame in some quarters.”\nTunny shrugged. “The rich folk seem to like you more than ever.” It was\ntrue that a polite crowd of well-dressed well-wishers had been gathered at\nthe gates of Adua to welcome him. “And they can express their love\nfinancially.”\n“True,” said Yolk, “I mean, what’s the love of the poor actually worth?”\n“Oh, indeed,” said Orso. “All the best kings had utter contempt for the\nmajority of their subjects.”\nHe had intended his sarcasm to be withering but Yolk managed to miss it\neven so. “Exactly,” he said. “That’s what I’m saying.”\nThe queen waited, perched with rigid discipline on one of her\nuncomfortable gilded chairs in the centre of her vast salon.

Four musicians\nsmiled radiantly as they sawed out soothing music in a distant corner.\n“Orso! The conquering hero!” She rose to greet him, which was an\nalmost unprecedented honour, gave him a chilly kiss on the cheek, then a\nchilly pat on the same spot for good measure. “I have never been prouder of\nyou.”\n“I fear I have not set a high standard in that regard.”\n“Even so.”\nOrso went straight to the decanter and pulled out the stopper. It was hard\nto think of a good reason for the stopper ever to be in, really. “I find I can\nhardly compete with the victories of the Young Lion, however.”\nQueen Terez flared her nostrils magnificently. “You won without\ndrawing your sword. Your grandfather always said that was the best kind of\nvictory. He would have been proud of you, too.”\nOrso’s grandfather and namesake, Grand Duke Orso of Talins, had by\nmost accounts been a tyrant despised the length of Styria. But then he had\nbeen defeated, deposed and assassinated, and such men generally receive\npoor reports from posterity. “I tricked some peasants into surrendering then\nhanged them,” he said as he poured. “That’s what the history books will\nsay.”\n“The history books will say whatever you order the historians to write.\nYou will be a king, Orso. You cannot think of the few, but must consider the\nwelfare of the many. I trust this little episode has quenched your thirst for\nglory for the time being, at least.”\n“I suspect it has quenched it for all time. In fact… I’ve been thinking\nabout my dynastic responsibilities. Marriage, you know.”\nThe queen’s head snapped towards him like that of a hawk that has\nspotted a vole in the bracken. “You mean it?”\n“I do.”\nShe snapped her fingers. “The eldest daughter of the Duke of Nicante is\ncoming of age and that family is almost indecently fertile. She is rumoured\nto have a wonderfully gentle temperament—”\nOrso chuckled. “I’m not sure gentle temperaments are my type.”\n“You have a type, now?”\n“Actually, I do.”\nActually, there was one woman for him and the rest were all dross. The\ninstant he had seen her in his tent, he had known he was hopelessly in love.\nThe dignity. The resilience. The sheer guts of the woman, unbowed by all\nhardship. She needed no jewels, no powder, no wigs. She was more\nbeautiful without them. He knew he didn’t deserve her, but he wanted to\ndeserve her, and in working to deserve her, he might come actually to\ndeserve her. Or something. The weather was dreary outside, rain pattering\non the great windows, gusts scattering brown leaves across the palace\ngardens, but as Orso thought about Savine, it was as if the sun came out and\npoured its warmth upon him.\nHis mother caught his blissful grin forming and narrowed her eyes.\n“Why do I feel you already have a lady in mind?”\n“Because I have nothing on my mind but one particular lady.” The"

But the time comes in every man’s life when he\nmust set his mother’s opinions to one side. He took a deep breath and sat\nforward. “Mother—”\nHe was interrupted by a knock at the door. It creaked open a crack and\nHildi’s head slid through. She fumbled off her cap to reveal blonde curls for\nsome reason cropped short. “I’ve got that message you’ve been waiting for,\nYour Highness.” And she showed the letter. Just a square of white paper\nwith a white seal. Such a small package to hold all his dreams.\n“Yes, yes!” snapped Orso, nearly jumping out of his seat with\nexcitement. “Come, come!”\nIt seemed to take her an age to shuffle nervously across the great\nexpanse of gleaming tiles, then to stop and give the queen a wobbling\ncurtsy. “Your Majesty—”\n“Never mind that!” snapped Orso, snatching the letter from her hand. He\ncould not remember ever being so eager for anything in his life. He fumbled\nwith the seal but his hands were clumsy as mittens and he ended up ripping\nit wide in his haste. His heart was pounding. His sight was swimming with\nnerves. But it was brief, so it could only be a yes. Surely a yes. What else\ncould it be?\nHe closed his eyes, letting the music soothe him, took a long breath,\ncomposed himself, and read.\nMy answer must be no. I would ask you not to contact me again.\nEver.\nSavine.\nThat was all.\nHis first feeling was stunned disbelief. Could she have turned him\ndown? How could she have turned him down? He had been so sure this was\nwhat they both wanted.\nHe read it again. And then a third time. My answer must be no.\nAnd now came a stab of hot fury. Did she have to do it so fucking\nrudely? So savagely? With a note? With a line? He had offered her\neverything he had, everything he was, and she had trodden on his cock\nwhile she kicked his guts out. He crushed the note up in his trembling fist.\n“Bad news?” asked his mother.\n“Nothing to worry about,” he somehow heard himself saying in the\nusual bored drawl.\nAnd now came a flood of cold loss. Like that, all his dreams were\nruined. It was a note that left no room for hope. No room for wheedling,\neven by a veteran wheedler like him. I would ask you not to contact me\nagain. Ever. There would never be another woman who understood him the\nway she did. There would never be another woman like her at all. She had\nnever felt so dazzlingly desirable as she did now he could never have her.\n“Is there a reply?” asked Hildi, frowning.\n“No,” he managed to say, “no reply.” What reply could there be to that?\nAnd now came the slow welling up of self-hatred, steadily becoming a\nflood of utter disgust.

What was the point? He had been so sure\nthis was what he wanted, he had hardly stopped to consider her desires.\nEveryone said he was epically self-centred, after all. It was no great surprise\nthat everyone turned out to be right. Why would a woman like her want a\nman like him? Why would any woman? Aside from a crown, some bad\njokes and a shitty reputation, what did he really have to offer?\n“We must plan a grand triumph for you!” His mother’s eyes sparkled at\nthe thought of how right she would finally be proved in the eyes of the\nworld. “The nation shall bear witness to the vindication of our family. I\nshall make sure of it.”\nAnd now he slid into a bog of depression. Savine had been the\napproaching dawn, and now the sun was snuffed out and he was plunged\ninto eternal gloom. He watched the rain thicken outside. It wasn’t only her\nthat he had lost, but the better man he could have been with her beside him,\nthe better Union they might have forged together. He felt himself wilting,\nmelting down his chair into a sagging slump. He scarcely had the energy to\nlift his head. Scarcely had the energy to breathe.\nHe had tried, too little and too late, to make something of himself. The\nresult was two hundred corpses gibbetted on the road to Valbeck and a\ndismissive note.\n“And then we have a wedding to plan. As soon as we can find someone\nof your type.”\nWhy did he bother? Why did he bother with anything?\nHe drained his glass. The best Osprian, but it was sawdust on his tongue.\nHe heaved up a sigh that actually hurt.\nHe wanted to cry.\n“Pour me another, would you?” he murmured.\nQuestions\n“I\nt’s me,” said Tallow, with his flair for stating the obvious. Vick had\nknown it would be him. Wasn’t as if she got a lot of visitors.\nShe took his shoulder and slipped him past into the narrow hall. Not\nmuch room but she was thinner even than usual after Valbeck and Tallow\nhad always been a scrap of nothing. She glanced around the ill-lit yard\noutside. A habit from the camps, kept ever since the camps. But there was\nno one watching. The only sound was the dripping from a broken gutter,\nhigh above.\n“You all right?” she asked Tallow as she shouldered the door shut and\nslid both the heavy bolts.\n“You were the one stuck in the city,” he said.\n“Don’t worry about me.”\n“’Course not,” he said, giving his shoes a sad grin. “You’re carved out o’\nwood. Nothing touches you.”\nHe was more like her brother every time she saw him. Or maybe it was\nher memory that was changing. Making her brother more like Tallow. So\nshe could save him this time around, maybe. How pathetic would that be?\nMemory could betray you, she’d seen it a hundred times. Chop things about\nuntil they suited you better. You have to be on guard all the time. Against\neveryone else. Against yourself."

Show them a weakness, they’ll find a way to use it.\n“You see your sister?” she asked as she led him from the cramped hall\ninto the cramped dining room.\n“I saw her.”\n“She’s well?”\nTallow nodded in a way that seemed to say no thanks to you. Or maybe\nshe just thought it did. She nudged a chair out with her boot and he slipped\ninto it, around the squares board. Wasn’t easy, even thin as he was.\n“What’s this?”\nShe realised, with an odd little stab of annoyance, that he was looking\ndown at Sibalt’s book. The Life of Dab Sweet. Open at that page. The one it\nfell open at. That etching of a lone rider, looking out across the endless\ngrass and the endless sky.\nFelt decidedly unpleasant, having someone else look at it. Like they\nwere looking inside her head, at her secret dreams. “It’s the Far Country,”\nshe said, softly.\n“Pretty.”\nShe should’ve thrown the damn thing away. She reached out and\nsnapped it shut. “It’s a made-up picture in a book full of lies.” And she\ntossed it on the dusty windowsill.\nTallow shrank down into his shoulders. “Guess so.”\nShe felt a little bad, then, for snapping. “Can I get you something?” she\ngrunted. That was what you were supposed to do, when you had a guest.\nHowever unwilling a guest.\n“What have you got?”\nShe thought about that for a moment. “Nothing.”\n“I’ll take a double serving o’ that, then.” Tallow glanced about her\nnarrow, bare apartment with those big eyes of his, the walls mottled with\ndamp around the dirty window. “So this is what you do it for?”\n“What?”\n“All this.” He raised his arms and let them hopelessly drop. Had to be\nadmitted, looking with his fresh eyes, it was less than impressive. Vick was\nonly here when she had nowhere else to be.\n“Would you feel happier if I was living like a queen?”\n“I’d understand it, at least.” He leaned towards her across the narrow\ntable. If she’d leaned towards him the same way, they’d have butted heads\nin the middle. “They hanged two hundred people, you know. ’Cause of\nwhat we did.”\n“Two hundred traitors.” She poked at the table under his face with her\npointing finger. “Because of what they did. How many died in their idiot\nuprising? Don’t fool yourself there was some right side to this. Don’t fool\nyourself there was a noble path we didn’t take. We took the only path there\nwas. Regret it if you please, but I won’t!” She realised he was sat back now,\nand she was sat forward, almost shouting. She lowered her voice with an\neffort. Less furious denial, more statement of fact. “I won’t. Here.” She\nslipped the coin from her pocket and put it down on the table between them\nwith a deliberate snap.

You took the\ninitiative.”\n“I just did what you told me.”\n“You did it well.”\nHe stared down at that golden coin. “Can’t say I feel too proud of\nmyself.”\n“I only care about what you do. How you feel about it is up to you. But\nleave the coin, if it bothers you that much.”\nHe swallowed, sharp knobble on the front of his throat shifting, then he\nreached out and swept the coin off the table. Just like she’d known he\nwould. She had to smile at that. Hell, but he was like her brother.\n“We’re not all carved out o’ wood,” he grunted.\n“Give it a while,” she said. “You’ll get there.”\n“Inquisitor Teufel!” Glokta grinned as though her visit was a delightful\nsurprise rather than a meeting he’d demanded and she couldn’t refuse. He\npatted the bench beside him. “Do sit.”\nSitting close to other people always made her uncomfortable. But then\nshe’d slept next to strangers in the camps. Packed together in the stinking\nstraw like piglets in a litter. Better that than freeze. Better this than offend\nHis Eminence.\nShe sat, looking out across the park, tugging her coat tight about her. It\nwas a clear, crisp day, the odd gust of wind sweeping ripples in the surface\nof the lake, bringing flurries of leaves down from the trees. Stirring them\nabout the black boots of the watchful Practicals.\n“I used to spend a great deal of time on this very bench.” Glokta\nsquinted into the autumn brightness. “Just watching the water. My\nphysicians say I should get into the sun more.”\n“It’s a very… restful spot,” said Vick. Small talk had never really been\nher strength.\n“As if either one of us will find rest this side of the grave.” Glokta gave\nher his hollow smile. “You did an excellent job in Valbeck. You showed\nquick thinking, courage and loyalty. Superior Pike was most impressed, and\nhe is a hard man to impress.”\nIt wasn’t lost on Vick that he was giving her the same compliments\nshe’d just given Tallow. Some people you reel in by making them think they\nneed you. More often, it’s making them think you need them. People want\nto feel good about themselves. Want to feel needed. Vick wondered if she’d\nbeen reeled in already. Long ago.\nShe left it at a simple, “Thank you, Your Eminence.”\n“I am coming to rely on you more and more. You really are the only\nperson I feel I can entirely trust.”\nVick wondered how many other people the Arch Lector had fed that\nsame lie to. The idea that he might entirely trust anyone was sugaring the\npudding too much, but she let it go. She let them both believe they both\nbelieved it.\n“You’ve earned a reward,” he went on. “Is there anything you need?”\nVick didn’t like rewards. Not even ones she’d earned. They felt too"

They felt too\nmuch like debts she might have to repay. She thought about saying, Only to\nserve, or some patriotic guff, but that would’ve been her sugaring the\npudding too much. She settled for, “No.”\n“Let me get you some better lodgings, at least.”\n“What’s wrong with the ones I have?”\n“I know exactly what’s wrong with them. I used to live in them. When I\nserved my predecessor, Arch Lector Sult.”\n“They serve my purposes.”\n“They served mine, but I didn’t mind getting better ones. There are\npeople who take far more for far less.”\n“That’s up to them.”\nHe smiled as though he knew exactly what she was thinking. Had\nexpected it, even. “Perhaps you somehow feel, if you do not take the\nrewards for your work, it is as if you have not done the work? Because we\nboth know you did the work.”\n“I’ll take new lodgings when the job’s done, Your Eminence.” She\nwatched a gardener rake leaves into a barrow. A thankless task, every breeze\nbringing more onto the narrow patch he’d already cleared. “Things could’ve\ngone much better in Valbeck. Risinau escaped. Judge as well. He may be\ndangerous. She most definitely is. Many more left the city before the crown\nprince arrived, and I don’t think the outcome will have made them any less\neager for their Great Change.”\n“Nor do I. The Breakers have been…broken… only for the time being.”\n“Risinau was a fat dreamer. I don’t believe he planned the uprising on\nhis own.”\n“I am inclined to agree.” The Arch Lector swept the park with his\nnarrowed eyes, lowered his voice a cautious fraction. “But I am beginning\nto suspect the roots of our problem may lie at the opposite end of the social\nscale.” And he shifted his glance significantly sideways. The gilded dome of\nthe new Lords’ Round peeped glinting over the trees.\n“The nobles?”\n“They were taxed heavily to pay for the king’s wars in Styria.” Glokta\nscarcely moved his thin lips as he spoke. “They demanded reforms to\ncompensate, acquired a great deal of common land. Many lined their\npockets handsomely. Nonetheless, most of the Open Council recently\nsigned a letter of complaint to the king.”\n“Complaining of what?”\n“The usual things. Not enough power. Not enough money.”\n“Demanding what?”\n“The usual things. More money. More power.”\n“You’re suspicious of the men who signed this letter?”\n“Absolutely.” Glokta reached up with his handkerchief to dab at his\nweepy eye. “But far less than I am of the ones who did not.”\n“Names, Your Eminence?”\n“The Brocks I can excuse, they have been rather busy in the North. But\nthe young Lords Heugen, Barezin and above all Isher smile entirely too\nmuch. They lost out when the king was elected, or at any rate their fathers\ndid.

A mass of walls, and bridges, and endless\nbuildings crusted together like barnacles at low tide, rivers and canals\nglinting dully among them. Towers stuck up above, and great chimneys tall\nas towers, their brown smoke smeared across the skies.\nShe’d heard it was big. Everyone had heard that. If anyone went to\nAdua, they’d come back scratching their heads and saying, “It’s big,” but\nshe’d never expected it to be this big. You might’ve fitted a hundred\nUffriths into it and still had room for a hundred Carleons. Her eye couldn’t\nmake sense of the scale. The number of buildings, the number of ships, the\nnumber of people, like ants in an anthill. A thousand anthills. The thought of\nit was making her head spin. Or spin more, maybe. She looked down at the\ndeck, rubbing her temples. She’d been feeling insignificant enough already.\n“By the dead,” she muttered again, puffing out her cheeks.\n“Adua,” said the man standing next to her. “The centre of the world.” He\nwas a thickset old fellow with heavy brows, a short grey beard and a bald\nhead looked like it had been beaten out of iron on an anvil, all planes and\nknobbles. “The poets call her the City of White Towers, though they tend\ntowards the grey-brown these days. Beautiful, isn’t she, from a distance?”\nHe leaned nearer. “Believe me, though, she stinks when you get close.”\n“Most things do,” muttered Rikke, frowning at Leo. The Young Lion,\ngrinning into the wind with his carefree friends, the bloody young lads\ntogether, the bloody young heroes, the bloody young pricks.

The truth was, she bloody missed him.\nBut she was damned if she was saying sorry. It should be him saying sorry\nto her, on bended knees. But how could you hate a man with an arse like—\nHe glanced towards her and she made sure she looked away. Him\ncatching her looking would be like he’d scored a point somehow. But\nlooking away from Leo meant looking back to this bald bastard, who was\nstill considering her as if he found her of quite some interest.\n“Who the hell are you, anyway?” she asked. Somewhat rude, but her\nfailed romance and her endlessly hot and smarting eye and a week or two of\nseasickness had worn down her patience.\nHis smile only grew wider. A hungry smile, like a fox at the henhouse.\n“My name is Bayaz.”\n“Like the First of the Magi?”\n“Exactly like. I am he.”\nRikke blinked. Perhaps she should’ve punched him for a liar. But there\nwas something in his glittering green eyes that made her believe it. “Well,\nthere’s a thing.”\n“And you are Rikke. The Dogman’s daughter.” She stared at him, and he\nsmiled back. “Knowledge is the root of power. In my business, you have to\nknow who’s who.”\n“What is your business?”\nHe leaned close, almost hissing the word. “Everything.”\n“That’s quite some area of responsibility.”\n“Sometimes, I admit, I think I should have aimed lower.”\n“Shouldn’t you have a staff?”\n“I left it at home. However big a chest you bring, it never quite fits in.\nAnd magic, you know, it’s all rather…” And he squinted thoughtfully\ntowards the city. “Out of fashion, these days.”\n“Speak for yourself,” she said, shifting her chagga pellet across her\nmouth and chomping it on the other side. “I’ve been blessed with the Long\nEye.” At that moment, she glimpsed the faintest phantom of a sinking ship,\nits mast tipping towards them as it foundered on a stormy sea. She cleared\nher throat, doing her best to ignore the ghostly sailors toppling into the\nbrine. “Or possibly cursed with it.”\n“Fascinating. And what have you seen?”\n“Frustrating glimpses, in the main. Ghosts and shadows. An arrow and a\nsword. A black pit in the sky with the knowing of everything inside. I saw a\nwolf eat the sun and a lion eat the wolf then a lamb eat the lion then an owl\neat the lamb.”\n“And what does that portend?”\n“I’m entirely fucked if I know.”\n“What do you see when you look at me?”\nShe frowned sideways. “A man who could tell more truth and eat fewer\npies.”\n“Ah.” And he rested one broad hand on his belly. “Profound revelations\nindeed.”\nRikke grinned.

Had to admit she was starting to like him, even if she had\nno idea whether to believe a word he said. “What brings the First of the\nMagi to Adua?”\n“I have been detained far too long in the ruined West of the world by the\ndemands of some most unreasonable siblings. They are mired in the past.\nBlinkered to the future. But I like to stop off in Adua whenever I can. Try to\nmake sure no one is destroying what I have built.” He narrowed his eyes\nacross the bay, crammed with vessels of every shape, size and design.\n“People’s capacity for self-harm never ceases to amaze me. They love to\nfind their own path, even if it clearly leads off a cliff. And the Union has\nmany enemies.”\nRikke raised her brows at the endless city. “Who’d be fool enough to\nmake war on this?”\n“The Gurkish, before their empire collapsed like an undercooked\nmeringue. And Bethod, against my advice. Then Black Dow, against my\nadvice. Then Black Calder. Against my advice.”\n“Seems your advice ain’t as popular as you’d like,” said Rikke, glancing\nsideways.\nBayaz gave a disappointed sigh, like the governess in Ostenhorm when\nshe tried to explain to Rikke what deportment was. “People must sometimes\nbe allowed to make their own mistakes.”\nShe shielded her eyes against the spray as they cut through the mad\nconfusion of shipping towards the swarming docks. She could hear the faint\ndin of voices bellowing and wagons rumbling and cargo hitting the\nwharves.\n“How many live here?” she whispered.\n“Thousands.” The First of the Magi shrugged. “Millions maybe, now,\nbuilding upwards and bloating outwards every day. Eclipsing even the great\ncities of old for scale, if not for splendour. People from every land within\nthe Circle of the World. Dark-skinned Kantics fleeing the chaos in Gurkhul,\npale Northmen seeking work and people of the Old Empire seeking new\nbeginnings. Adventurers from the new kingdom of Styria, traders from the\nThousand Isles, people of Suljuk, and Thond, where they worship the sun.\nMore than can be counted—living, dying, working, breeding, climbing one\nupon the other. Welcome,” and Bayaz spread his arms wide to encompass\nthe monstrous, the beautiful, the endless city, “to civilisation!”\nJurand stared towards Adua, eyes narrowed against the spray. “By the Fates,\nthe city’s grown.”\n“Hugely,” said Leo. Yet it somehow looked smaller than the last time he\nvisited. Then he’d been just the rural-mannered young son of a lord\ngovernor. Now he was a lord governor himself, who’d beaten a great\nwarrior in single combat, saved the Protectorate and won a famous victory\nfor the king single-handed.\nNo doubt Adua had grown. But Leo dan Brock had grown more.\nHe found himself glancing sideways. Where he was always glancing,\nagainst his better judgement. Towards Rikke.

The House of the Maker, the dome of the Lords’ Round. The\nThree Farms with the plumes of smoke from its new manufactories. They\ncould’ve been enjoying this together, if she hadn’t been such a sulky,\nstubborn bitch. He’d nearly died in the Circle for her. And she treated him\nlike a traitor.\nHe was cranking himself up to bitter outrage when he caught sight of\nher, waving her arms in that mad way she had while she talked to some bald\nold man, and all he felt was sad, and guilty, as if he’d wandered off the right\npath and couldn’t find his way back. The truth was, he bloody missed her.\nWasn’t long ago he’d said he loved her, and he’d at least half meant it. But\nhe was damned if he was apologising. It should be her begging forgiveness\n—\nShe glanced over and he only just looked away in time. If she saw him\nlooking, she’d treat it like a petty victory. Everything was so petty with her.\nWhy couldn’t she just forgive him so they could go back to how things\nwere?\n“Looks like they’ve sent a welcoming committee,” said Glaward,\npointing towards the thronging wharves.\nLeo perked up at that. A decent crowd had gathered on the quay under a\ngreat banner marked with the golden sun of the Union and another with the\ncrossed hammers of Angland. Armoured men sat on horseback in a perfect\nrow, wearing the purple cloaks of Knights of the Body. An honour guard\nfrom the king! At the front was a man with monstrous shoulders and an\neven more monstrous neck, his hair clipped to grey stubble.\nJurand was leaning dangerously far over the rail to see. “Is that…\nBremer dan Gorst?”\nLeo squinted towards him as the ship slid in closer to the harbour,\ncaptain squawking out commands and the sailors swarming to obey. “Do\nyou know,” he said, perking up further, “I think it is!”\nWhen the gangplank scraped to dry land, Leo made sure he was first\nacross, still walking with a stick, if only to remind everyone he’d been\nheroically wounded in a noble cause. A man with a balding pink head and a\nheavy chain of office started towards him. One weak chin had clearly not\nbeen weak enough, and he had opted for several spread across his fur-\ntrimmed collar.\n“Your Grace, I am Lord Chamberlain Hoff, son of Lord Chamberlain\nHoff.” He paused, as though expecting gales of laughter. None came. No\ndoubt bureaucrats were a regrettable necessity, like latrines, but Leo didn’t\nhave to like them. Especially when bureaucracy became a family business.\n“And this is—”\n“Bremer dan Gorst!” He would encounter important people now, of\ncourse, but there’s something special about meeting a boyhood hero.

How he turned the tide on the\nbridge single-handed and led the final assault on the Heroes, hacking\nthrough Northmen like a butcher through sheep. “I once saw you fight three\nmen in an exhibition!” Leo brushed the lord chamberlain aside to seize the\nbig man’s hand and got a nasty surprise. You can tell a lot about a man from\nhis grip, Leo’s father always said, and Gorst’s was shockingly limp and\nclammy.\n“Not something I would advise on the battlefield.” Gorst’s voice was\neven more shocking than his handshake. Leo wouldn’t have believed so\nmighty a neck could produce so womanly a tone.\n“I think I once heard we’re related?” he said as they began to mount up.\n“Fifth cousins or some such.” Leo tossed his stick to Jurand. He was\ndamned if he’d look like a cripple in front of a man he so much admired. He\ninsisted on dragging himself into the saddle in spite of the pain in his leg,\nstomach, side, shoulder.\n“How is… your mother?” came Gorst’s odd squeak.\n“She’s well,” said Leo, surprised. “Happy the war’s over. She was\nleading the fight when the Northmen first attacked.” He thought about the\nlight that put him in. “Giving me some excellent advice, at least.”\n“She was always highly perceptive.”\n“I knew you saved my father’s life at Osrung. He used to love to tell that\nstory. But I’d no idea you knew my mother.”\nGorst looked a little pained. “We were good friends… at one time.”\n“Huh.” Leo had spent more than enough of his life worrying about his\nmother’s feelings. He abruptly changed the subject. “I would’ve loved to\ntrain with you while I’m here, but… I fear I’m in no fit state. Maybe I could\nobserve?”\n“Alas, there will be so many demands on Your Grace’s time,” said the\nlord chamberlain, oozing uninvited into their conversation. “His Majesty is\nkeen to greet you.”\n“Well… I’m at His Majesty’s disposal, of course.” Leo gave his horse a\nnudge and set off at a walk after the two standard-bearers.\n“As are we all, Your Grace. But first His Eminence the Arch Lector\nwishes to discuss your triumph.”\n“Since when do Inquisitors arrange parades?”\nThe lord chamberlain delicately cleared his throat. “Your Grace will\ndiscover there is little that happens in Adua without Arch Lector Glokta’s\napproval.”\nOne of the banners at the front of the Young Lion’s grand column had got\ntangled with a washing line, so they all had to sit in their splendid saddles\nwaiting for it to get untangled. Leo himself could hardly be seen for the\nfawning gaggle of overpriced arse-lickers. Even Jurand and Glaward had\nbeen demoted to trailing after, eased further back with every turn. Seemed\nthe fake adoration of strangers mattered more to Leo than his friends, or his\nfamily, or his lover. If that’s what she still was to him. If that’s what she’d\never been."

If that’s what she’d\never been.\nRikke raised her brows as a whole column of dark-skinned soldiers\ntramped out of a side street, gilded standards flashing and spears lowered.\nWasn’t until a wagon rattled right through ’em she realised they weren’t\nthere.\n“By the dead.” She held a hand over her left eye, hot and itching and\naching right into her teeth.\n“Still seeing things?” murmured Isern, jaw chomp-chomping happily on\nchagga. “Take it as proof the moon has marked you special, and rejoice.”\nIt all made Rikke more than a bit nostalgic for a time when folk just\nthought she was mad. “If this is special, I reckon I’d rather be ordinary.”\n“Aye, well, we all want the things we haven’t got.”\n“That’s it? Thought you were here to help me with the Long Eye?”\n“I said I’d work out if you had it, then help you ease it open. Plain to\neveryone at that battle or that duel you’ve got it and it’s wide open.” Isern\ngrinned over. “Closing the bastard was never numbered among my\npromises.”\n“Fucking marvellous,” muttered Rikke, nudging her horse on so she\ncould find some space to get a breath. Wasn’t easy in this damn place,\nthough.\nBy the dead, the air. Close and sticky and full of odd smells. There was\na catch and a scratch in her throat, a sting at her eyes, like far-off burning.\nAnd the noise. The babbling in a dozen languages she didn’t know,\npleading, shouting, fighting, everyone shoving on to nowhere as if they\nwere all endlessly late for everything. Hammers clanging, wheels turning\nand fires burning, so many it became a low rumble that made the ground\nbuzz. As though the city itself were alive, and tortured, and angry, and\ndesperate to wriggle free of its infestation of human lice.\n“All this progress.” Bayaz again, glancing approvingly at vast building\nsites to either side, with their towering cranes and their cobwebs of rope and\nscaffold and their swarms of bellowing workmen. “You would not believe\nhow much it has changed in so short a time. This district, the Three Farms?\nI remember when it was three farms, and far outside the city walls! The city\nburst those walls and they threw up another set and it burst those, too, and\nthe Three Farms is so built over with manufactories, there’s barely a stride\nof grass left in the borough. All iron and stone, now.”\nRikke watched one of the horses in front lift its tail and drop a few turds.\nThere was still plenty of that in the streets. “All iron and stone? That a good\nthing?”\nBayaz snorted as if the whole idea of good was a waste of his valuable\ntime. “It is a thing as irresistible as the tide. A golden tide of industry and\ncommerce.

When you reach my age, you learn to swim with the current.”\n“Huh. Would’ve thought famous wizards would ride up front with the\nbig folk, rather than getting stuck at the back with the dross.”\nBayaz smiled. He was a hard bastard to rattle, the First of the Magi.\n“The figurehead goes at the front of the ship. Braves the terror of wind and\nwaves, takes the risks and reaps the glory. But it’s an unnoticed fellow\nhidden away near the back who does the steering.” He smiled up towards\nthe head of the column. “No leader worth a damn ever led from the front.”\n“Words to live by, I reckon,” murmured Rikke.\n“The last wisdom I can offer you for the moment, I fear.” And Bayaz\npulled his horse up at the grand front steps of a building. Vast, it was,\nsomewhere between fortress and temple with huge pillars at the front and\ncarved masonry all over but precious little in the way o’ windows.\n“What’s this place?” She didn’t much like its looks. Lots of serious\npeople going in and out, stepping around some well-dressed fellow with\npapers dangling from one limp hand, the strangest horrified look on his\nface. “A school for wizards?”\n“Not quite,” said the First of the Magi. “It is a bank.”\n“Master Bayaz?” An ordinary-looking man had come up to hold the\nwizard’s bridle.\n“Ah! This is Yoru Sulfur, a member of the Order of Magi.”\n“I’m Rikke,” said Rikke, “rhymes with—”\n“Yes,” said Sulfur, smiling up. “The Dogman’s daughter. The one\nblessed with the Long Eye.”\nRikke was caught between suspicion and satisfaction that her legend had\ncome ahead of her. “Or cursed with it, I guess.”\n“I hope we might speak more later,” said Bayaz. “Young women born\nwith the Long Eye are rare indeed in these latter days.”\n“Almost as rare as Magi,” she grunted.\nSulfur smiled wider, his eyes never leaving her face, and she realised\nthey were different colours, one blue, one green. “We relics of the Age of\nMagic really should stick together.”\n“Can’t see why not. I’m hardly besieged by admirers.”\n“Not yet, perhaps.” Bayaz gave her one last thoughtful glance. Like a\nbutcher assessing a shepherd’s flock and judging what to offer. “But who\ncan say what the future holds?”\n“Aye,” murmured Rikke as she watched him climb the steps with his\ncurly haired sidekick, “that’d be a fine bloody trick.”\nShivers was sitting in his saddle, turning that ring he wore on his little\nfinger around and around, glaring up at the bank with a frown hard even for\nhim.\n“What’s your problem?” asked Rikke.\nHe turned his head and spat. “Never trusted banks.”\nThe man they called Old Sticks, the king’s chief torturer, Arch Lector\nGlokta, hunched behind a giant desk loaded with papers, frowning as he"

Death sentences, Leo imagined, bloodlessly\nexecuted with a flick of the pen.\nHis Eminence made Leo wait an insultingly long time before he finally\nlooked up, winced as he leaned to drop his pen into its bottle of ink, and\nsmiled. On that gaunt, waxy, wasted face, etched by deep grimace-lines, a\nyawning gap where the four front teeth should’ve been, it was an expression\nas painfully unsettling as a leg bent the wrong way at the knee. If inward\ncorruption expressed itself as outward ugliness—and Leo had always been\nsure it did—the Arch Lector was even more vile than the vilest things they\nsaid about him. And that was saying something. He held out his hand.\n“Forgive me, Your Grace, I cannot easily rise.”\n“Of course.” Leo limped forward, leaning heavily on his cane. “Not too\nsprightly myself right now.”\n“You, I trust, will heal.” Glokta’s revolting grin grew wider. “I fear that\nship has sailed for me.”\nHe looked as if a stiff breeze would shred him, but his bony hand, its\nliver-spotted skin almost transparent, gripped far harder than Bremer dan\nGorst’s great paw. You can tell a lot about a man from his handshake, his\nfather had always said, and this old cripple’s was like a smith’s pincers.\n“I must congratulate you on your victory,” said Glokta, after studying\nLeo a moment longer. “You have done the Crown a great service.”\n“Thank you, Your Eminence.” Though who could’ve denied it? “But I\ndidn’t do it alone. Lot of good men dead. Good friends… dead. And the\ncost to Angland’s coffers was huge.” Leo pulled out the weighty scroll his\nmother had given him. “The ruling council of the province asked me to\npresent His Majesty’s advisors with this accounting for the campaign. In the\nabsence of any help from the Crown during the war, they expect—they\ndemand—financial support in the aftermath.” Leo had practised that speech\non the trip and was rather pleased with how it came out. He could manage\nthis bureaucracy business as well as anyone. But Glokta looked at the scroll\nas if he was being presented with a turd. His eyes moved up to Leo’s.\n“Your triumph will take place in three days’ time. A parade of some four\nthousand soldiers, as well as foreign dignitaries and members of the Closed\nand Open Councils. It will begin at the palace, chart a course through the\ncity around Arnault’s Wall, and return to the Square of Marshals. There His\nMajesty will give an address to the Union’s foremost citizens and present\nyou with a commemorative sword.”\nLeo couldn’t help smiling. “That all sounds… marvellous.” The stuff of\nboyhood dreams, indeed.\n“Crown Prince Orso will ride alongside you,” added Glokta.\n“Pardon me?” asked Leo, smile quickly vanishing.\nThe Arch Lector’s eyelid flickered and a tear rolled down his cheek.

Great generosity, on his part, to share the glory.”\nLeo’s face tingled as if he’d been slapped. He bloody had been slapped,\nand in his pride, which was far more sensitive than his face. “I beat Stour\nNightfall in a duel! I spared his life!”\n“In return for what?”\n“For his father and uncle quitting our land, keeping the Dogman’s\nProtectorate alive and safeguarding Angland!”\n“No further concessions?” asked Glokta, his eyes glittering in their deep,\nbruised sockets. “No ongoing assurances?”\nLeo blinked, wrong-footed. “Well… there’s a code of honour among\nNorthmen.”\n“Even supposing there was, you aren’t one.”\n“Among warriors! Wherever they were born. And I was raised with\nNorthmen!” Leo curled his lip as he looked the cripple up and down. “You\nwouldn’t understand.”\n“No? How do you think I got crippled? Codes of honour, I fear, aren’t\nworth the paper they’re not written on. You could have taken Stour hostage.\nCould have delivered him to the king to ensure Scale Ironhand’s future\ngood behaviour. Instead, you secured nothing but his word.”\nLeo wasn’t sure whether he was more furious because Glokta was\nobviously wrong or because he wondered whether he might have a point.\nPerhaps there was more to this bureaucracy business than he’d thought. “I\nwon.” His voice had a hint of that whine it had when he complained to his\nmother. “I beat the whole bloody North! And without one soldier from\nAdua. I risked my life—”\n“You risked not only your life, which is yours to lose, but Union\ninterests, too, which most definitely are not. I am prone to be more\ngenerous, but some might call that reckless.”\n“I…” Leo could hardly believe it. “I made a friend of the next King of\nthe Northmen! I’m a soldier, not a bloody diplomat!”\n“You must be both.” Glokta was implacable. “You are a lord governor\nnow. One of the greatest men in the Union. One of His August Majesty’s\nmost important servants. You cannot simply think with your sword any\nmore. Do you understand, Your Grace?”\nLeo sat and stared, stunned by the disrespect, the injustice, the rank\ningratitude. He’d been far from keen on the Closed Council when he arrived\nin Adua. One interview with this crooked desk-worm and he was utterly\ndisgusted by them.\n“By all the fucking dead,” he whispered, in Northern.\nThe Arch Lector either took that for agreement or simply acted as if he\ndid. “I believe the lord chancellor wished to talk to you next.

He had the livery, anyway.\nBright green jacket with brass buttons, better than most officers had got in\nStyria. Shiny new boots, too, though they were prone to pinch. He might’ve\nfelt quite the fool in all the finery, if it hadn’t been so clear that anyone\nwithin a hundred paces would be staring at Savine instead, and that\nincluded him.\nHe could still hardly believe this beautiful, masterful woman was the\nsame ragged, helpless girl who’d hidden in his daughter’s room. She\nseemed to come from a different species than the sorry rest of humanity\nnow. Her clothes were a masterpiece of engineering as much as tailoring,\ntwisting her into a shape no person ever was. She was graceful as a\ntightrope-walker, unstoppable as a warship’s figurehead. Folk stood gaping\nat her, like one of the Fates had dropped from the sky and was taking a\nstroll through their building site.\n“Should I stay here?” muttered Broad as he helped Zuri down, not that\nshe needed it, she was deft as a dancer. Probably she should’ve been\nhelping him.\n“No, no.” She had a smile that was hard to pin down. “It would be\nlovely if you came along.”\nThey’d made a huge breach in the old city walls, rubble showing\nthrough a teetering mass of scaffolding and two cranes towering overhead.\nThey’d knocked down a few rows of houses, too, and were digging a\nmighty trench through the midst of it all. Parties of men, some of them\nbare-chested even in the cold, thumped away with picks and shovels in time\nto a work song growled between gritted teeth. Women in filthy dresses, wet\nhair plastered to their faces, slipped and slid up the bank with yokes across\ntheir shoulders holding buckets full of mud. Further back, children swarmed\nin the bottom of the great diggings, smeared grey from head to toe,\nstamping clay down around the sides of the trench with their bare feet.\n“What is this?” muttered Broad.\n“It will be a canal,” said Zuri, “floating cargo into the heart of the city.\nAnd out again, of course.”\n“What’s Lady Savine’s interest?”\n“One-fifth of it.

He was getting the sense he\nhadn’t been brought there to smile. “Everyone has been… extremely\nworried.”\n“So moving,” said Savine, pulling off her gloves one finger at a time\nwhile Zuri whipped free a dagger of a hatpin. “But in business, we must set\nsentiment aside.” With the slightest twist, Zuri lifted Savine’s hat away\nfrom a wig that must’ve cost more than Broad used to earn in a year. “I am\ndelighted to see work on our canal progressing so well.”\nKort winced, hesitated, winced again and finally leaned forward,\nclasping his hands. “There is no easy way to say this—”\n“Take the hard way, then, I am not made of glass.”\n“Regrettably, Lady Savine, I was obliged… to come to a new\naccommodation.”\n“And who has been so accommodating?”\n“Lady Selest dan Heugen.” Savine’s expression didn’t seem to change,\nbut Broad had the feeling it took a struggle. “Her cousin was kind enough to\narrange for some permits—”\n“We had an agreement, Master Kort.”\n“We did, but… you were not here to fulfil it. Thankfully, Lady Selest\nwas able to step into the breach.”\nSavine smiled. “And you think you can just slip her into my breach\nwithout so much as a by-your-leave?”\nKort shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “The banking house of Valint\nand Balk was kind enough to act as her backer, and she was kind enough to\nact as mine. Lady Savine, I was really given no choice—”\n“I recently spent several weeks living like a dog.” Savine still smiled,\nbut there was something brittle in it now. Something jagged. “And I do not\nmean that figuratively. Starving. Filthy. Hiding in a corner, constantly afraid\nfor my life. It has changed my perspective. It has made me see how very\nfragile we all are. Then I have been involved in a… let us call it an affair of\nthe heart, which did not end to my satisfaction. It did not end to my\nsatisfaction at all.”\n“I have nothing but sympathy, Lady Savine—”\n“Your sympathy is not worth a speck of shit.” Savine fished an\ninfinitesimal mote of dust from her sleeve and rubbed it away between\nfinger and thumb. “It’s your canal I want. Just what was agreed. No more\nand no less.”\n“What can I say?” Kort spread his big hands. “My canal is no longer\navailable.”\nSavine’s smile had hardened to a skull’s grin. The fibres in her neck"

The fibres in her neck\nstood out as she bit off the words. “The thing is, so much of business is a\nshow. It is about the confidence people have in you. And confidence is so\nfragile. I am sure we have both seen it a hundred times. Cast from iron one\nmoment, crumbling like sand the next. Following my misadventures in\nValbeck, confidence in me has been profoundly shaken. People are\nwatching me. Judging me.”\n“Lady Savine, I assure you—”\n“Don’t bother. I am merely trying to make you understand that, whoever\nyour backers might be, I cannot afford the luxury of letting you and Selest\ndan Heugen fuck me on this occasion.” And she glanced over at Broad, and\ncaught his eye.\nAt least there’ll be no trouble, serving a fine lady, eh? Liddy had said.\nBroad had smiled. Aye. No trouble. He didn’t smile now.\nHe knew exactly what Savine wanted. He’d seen that look in her eye\nbefore, on some of the men he’d fought with. The ones you had to watch.\nThe ones you had to worry about. He knew he’d had the same look. A kind\nof mad delight that it had come to this.\nHe didn’t understand business, or deals, or canals. But he understood\nthat look. All too well.\nSo Broad took hold of the edge of Kort’s great desk and moved it out of\nhis way. There was no room to push it into, so he just lifted one end. Papers,\nornaments, a nice letter opener, all slid down the green leather as it tilted\nlike a sinking ship, clattering off onto the floor beside it. He hefted the great\nthing all the way upright, leaving Kort oddly exposed in his chair, eyes\nwide and plump knees pressed fearfully together.\nBroad took off his lenses, and folded them, and slipped them into his\njacket pocket. Then he stepped forwards across the suddenly blurry office, a\nloose board creaking under his new boot.\n“I lost many things in Valbeck, Master Kort,” came Savine’s voice, from\nwhat sounded like a long way off. “Several investments and several\npartners, a lovely sword-belt and an irritating but very capable face-maid. I\nalso lost my patience.”\nBroad stepped so close to Kort that their knees touched. He leaned down\nand put his hands on the arms of Kort’s chair, their noses just a few inches\napart, close enough that the blur of his face resolved into an expression of\nextreme fear.\n“You displease me,” said Savine. “And I am in a mood to see things\nwhich displease me broken. Broken in such a way that they will not go back\ntogether.”\nBroad gripped the chair so hard that every joint in it groaned, breathing\nthrough his nostrils, like a bull. Bull Broad, they used to call him. He acted\nlike he was only just keeping a grip on himself. Maybe he was.\n“Our agreement stands!” squealed Kort, face turned away and his eyes\nscrewed shut. “Of course it does, Lady Savine, how could it be otherwise?”"

Who knows what might happen?”\nBroad pulled shut the office door behind them with a gentle click. It was\nonly when he took his hand from the knob he realised it was shaking.\nZuri leaned towards one of the clerks. “Master Kort may need a little\nhelp righting his desk.”\nIt seemed too bright outside as he followed Savine through the noise and\nbustle back to the carriage. “I’m not a coachman, am I?” he muttered.\n“Much of what I do is to recognise talent,” said Savine as she watched\nthe workers struggle in the diggings. “I saw yours the moment you saved\nme from those men, on the barricade in Valbeck. Employing you as a\ncoachman would be like employing a great artist to whitewash cottages. But\ndon’t you feel better for it?” She leaned close to murmur, “I know I do.”\nAnd she glided off towards the carriage as if the whole world belonged to\nher.\n“You’re a natural at this, Master Broad.” Zuri pressed something into his\npalm. A gold coin. A twenty-mark piece. More than he’d been paid for a\nmonth’s work at the brewery in Valbeck. More than he’d been paid for the\nassault in Musselia.\nBroad looked up at her. “You believe in God, right?”\n“Oh, yes. Absolutely.”\n“Thought he was dead set against violence?”\n“If he was set that firmly against it…” And Zuri smiled as she closed his\naching fist around the coin and gave it a fond pat. “Why would he make\nmen like you?”\nGood Times\nL\neo felt a bit of an outsider at his own party.\nIt was staged in the Hall of Mirrors, the most amazing room in a palace\nfull of amazing rooms, silvered Visserine glass covering every wall so the\nrichest, noblest and most beautiful the Union had to offer stretched away in\nevery direction into the dim distance.\nCertainly the introductions went on for ever. Damp hands were shaken\nand powdered cheeks kissed until Leo’s lips were chapped and his fingers\nraw. It was a flood of congratulations, admirations, well-wishes. An\nonslaught of long names and weighty titles scarcely heard and straight away\nforgotten.\nThe Ambassador from Here or There. The Over-Secretary for Whatever.\nThe niece of Lord What’s-his-Face.

Some bald old smirker someone\nmight’ve called the First of the Magi, who blurted some magical nonsense\nabout defeating Eaters in a Circle of salted iron being just like fighting\nStour Nightfall in a Circle of grass. Leo assumed it was a joke, and not a\nvery funny one. His cheeks ached from returning all the beaming smiles,\nthe promises of never-ceasing friendship which ceased with the next breath.\nThis was what he’d wanted, wasn’t it? To be fawned over by the greatest\npeople in the realm? But close up, it all felt so false. He’d much rather have\nbeen in a barn with the Dogman, and his warriors, and his friends. He\ncaught a glimpse of Jurand, standing on his own across the room, and Leo\nfelt himself smile. He made it one step towards him before he was cut off.\n“It’s an outrage, if you ask me,” murmured a tall man maybe ten years\nolder than Leo, though his carefully swept hair was pure white.\n“What is?” asked Leo, never able to resist the bait.\n“That you must share your triumph with the crown prince. You bled for\nthe nation. What did our half-Styrian heir do? Hang some peasants?”\nIt was like this white-haired fellow had peered into Leo’s skull and read\nout the contents. “I suppose taking credit for other men’s work is why we\nhave royalty,” murmured Leo.\n“I am Fedor dan Isher.” If you could know a man by his handshake, then\nIsher was firm, cool and careful. “These are my colleagues from the Open\nCouncil—Lords Barezin,” a heavy man stuffed into a braid-wreathed\nuniform, with pinking cheeks and a boyish riot of blond hair, “and\nHeugen.” Small and handsome with bright little eyes and sculpted\nmoustaches around a pouty mouth.\n“Good to meet you all.” It was pleasing to finally hear names Leo had\nheard before. These were the heads of three of Midderland’s most powerful\nnoble families. Men with seats next to his on the front row of the Lords’\nRound.\n“My father knew your father well.” Barezin’s jowls shook with feeling.\n“Such a wonderful man, he was always telling me, such a man’s man, such\nan exemplar of the noble virtues! They were close friends.” As far as Leo\ncould remember, his father had always written the Open Council off as a\nnest of vipers. But this was a new generation, and he reckoned you can\nnever have too many friends.\n“We all wish to thank you for the great service you did the Union,”\ndroned Isher.\n“It was a disgrace that you had to manage the business alone,” frothed\nBarezin. “A shameful business, awful!”\n“New laws prevent us from keeping standing armies of our own.”\nHeugen spoke with great pace and precision while constantly shaking his\nhead, as though nothing ever met his high standards. “Or we would have\nsprung to your aid ourselves.”\n“Too kind,” said Leo. Though actual aid would’ve been even kinder.\n“Our ancient rights and privileges are under constant attack,” said Isher,\ndropping his voice. “From Old Sticks and his cronies.”"

Though actual aid would’ve been even kinder.\n“Our ancient rights and privileges are under constant attack,” said Isher,\ndropping his voice. “From Old Sticks and his cronies.”\nHeugen nodded away like a chicken pecking at seed. “The Closed\nCouncil are—”\n“A crowd of bureaucratic arseholes,” burst out Leo. He couldn’t hold it\nin. “The gall of that bastard Glokta! Then the chancellor! Grilling me about\nextra taxes after we bled ourselves white winning their war! Good men\ngave their lives. Folk in Angland’ll be…” He was about to say fucking\nincandescent, then realised how loud he was talking and settled for, “very\ndispleased.”\nIsher looked quite delighted, however. “The Open Council must present\na united front. Especially with all this unrest among the lower orders.”\n“Your place is with us,” said Barezin.\n“As the foremost of us,” said Heugen.\n“As our champion,” said Isher, languidly clenching a fist, “just as your\ngrandfather was.”\n“Really?” asked Leo, getting just a bit suspicious of their close-harmony\nflattery. “I heard he was a traitor.”\nIsher wasn’t put off at all. He leaned closer to murmur, “I heard he was a\npatriot. He simply refused to be cowed by Bayaz.” And he nodded towards\nthat bald man, deep in a murmured conversation with Lord Chancellor\nGorodets, who did, it had to be admitted, look thoroughly cowed.\n“That actually is Bayaz?” asked Leo, baffled.\nIsher’s lip curled. “During the last war, he promised my uncles that they\nwould be chamberlain and chancellor, then, when he had the crown in his\npocket, he snatched the rug from under them.”\n“Loyalty is an admirable quality,” said Barezin. “Admirable. But it must\ncut both ways.”\n“Loyalty to a corrupt regime,” added Heugen, “is foolishness. Worse.\nCowardice. Worse! It’s disloyalty!”\nLeo wasn’t sure he followed the logic. “It is?”\n“We leading lights of the Open Council really must meet,” said Barezin.\n“Discuss the advancement of our mutual interests,” said Heugen.\n“To have a genuine hero among us would make all the difference,” said\nIsher.\n“It would certainly make all the difference to me.” Leo looked around to\nfind a very striking red-haired woman at his shoulder. “Your lordships really\nmustn’t hog the man of the moment. Since you haven’t the manners to\nintroduce me…” Though she’d given them no chance and could clearly\nmanage it herself. “I am Selest dan Heugen.” And she held her hand out.\n“Charmed,” said Leo, bending to kiss it. And he really was charmed, as\nwell. “The quality of the company’s looking up,” he said, and she gave a\nsilvery laugh, and fanned herself, and he smiled, and she fanned him, and\nhe laughed, and Isher, Barezin and Heugen melted away with a few\ngrumbles about speaking later, but Leo wasn’t really paying much attention\nany more."

Had a nice ring to it. And she had this breathless way of acting as\nthough every word he said was a delightful surprise.\n“Have you been enjoying our city?” she asked.\n“A lot more since you came over.”\n“Why, Your Grace, I suspect you’re flattering me.” She brushed his wrist\nwith her fingertips in a way that couldn’t have been accidental. Could it?\nShe leaned towards him, voice slightly husky. “You really should take a\ntour of my new manufactory while you’re in Adua.” As if touring\nmanufactories was a forbidden thrill. The way her eyes met his over the\nfeathers of her fan made him wonder whether a tour of other things might\nbe on offer.\n“What do you—” His voice came as squeaky as Bremer dan Gorst’s, and\nhe had to clear his throat and try again. “What do you make there?”\n“Money.” She gave another giggle. “What else?”\nRiding through Adua in a grand procession, Rikke had thought she couldn’t\nfeel more out of place. Now she discovered her error.\nIt was like they’d had a contest to dream up the circumstances she’d feel\nmost horribly small, twitchy and ugly in, and this right here had been the\nwinning idea. All she needed to complete the horror was to have a fit and\nshit herself across the pristine tiled floor.\nEveryone was so clean. Everyone smelled so good. Everyone’s shoes\nwere so shiny. They all had these little smiles, worn like masks, so you’d no\nnotion what they were really thinking. They all spoke in whispers, like\neverything was a secret meant only for particular ears and those ears\ncertainly weren’t hers. At least the Long Eye was leaving her alone for now.\nThe only ghosts in attendance were her own awkward reflections, wincing\nat her, profoundly unimpressed, from the mirrored walls of the hall.\nShe felt as if her own skin didn’t fit her, let alone her clothes. She\nwished she had some chagga to chew but she hadn’t brought any ’cause it\nhadn’t seemed the kind of place where you chewed chagga, and indeed it\nwasn’t. Where would you spit? Down someone else’s back? There were\nonly a handful of people she knew in the whole vast room. Bayaz she could\nhardly call a friend, and the magus had as fine a suit of clothes as anyone,\nslipping through the crowds with bald pate gleaming, trading hushed secrets\nas though he belonged there. Jurand stood alone, apparently pining for Leo\neven worse than Rikke was, while the Young Lion himself was forever at\nthe centre of a gaggle of fine new friends who’d no doubt stab him in the\nback the moment he turned it.\nAs if to rub salt in her still smarting wounds, some woman had floated\nup to him. Some pale and unearthly beautiful woman with hair redder than\nhair had any right to be, all scraped up with golden combs then swirling\ndown her bare, freckled shoulders. Her tits looked on the point of popping\nout the whole time, but by some sorcery of tailoring never quite managed it."

You’d have thought she had\nthe secret of creation tucked in her cleavage, the way his eyes kept drifting\nback to it. She had a necklace of sparkling red stones, and a bracelet to\nmatch, and flashing crystals stitched into her bodice and by the dead, on her\nshoes, too.\nRikke had a ring through her nose, like a troublesome bull.\nSummed it up. She wished she could pull the bloody thing out but there\nwas no way to do it without ripping half her nose off. She doubted even that\nwould’ve got anyone’s attention. She hadn’t the slightest notion how to play\nthis intricate game of fans and eyelashes and hints dropped over the\nshoulder and not quite but oh-so-nearly out tits, let alone the tools to win.\nShe slurped down some more of the thin wine they’d given her. Didn’t\ntaste of much but it was already having an effect. Namely making the tips\nof her ears feel hot and sinking her ever deeper into jealous depression.\nThey tell you drink makes you happy, but what they mean is it makes happy\nfolk happier. They don’t tell you that it makes unhappy folk more fucking\nunhappy than ever.\nShe gave an unpleasantly sweet burp and scraped her tongue on her\nteeth. “Men,” she muttered, helplessly.\n“I know,” came a voice from beside her. “There’s no reasoning with\nthem.”\nBy the dead, this one was even more beautiful than the other. Her skin\nhad this sheen, like she wasn’t made of meat but some magic alloy of flesh\nand silver, every gesture finished off right to the tips of her long fingers like\nit was part of a dance, endlessly practised and utterly perfected.\n“Shit,” breathed Rikke, unable to stop herself looking this woman up\nand down. “You have made some effort.”\n“Honestly, my maids made most of it. I only had to stand there.”\n“Maids? How many do you need?”\n“Only four, if they know their business. I very much like your shirt. It\nlooks so comfortable. I wish I could wear one.”\n“Why don’t you?”\n“Because there are a million different rules a lady of taste must observe.\nNo one tells you what they are, but the penalties for breaking them can be\nmost severe.”\n“That sounds a pain in the arse.”\n“You have no idea.”\n“Must admit, I didn’t really know what to expect.” Rikke plucked at her\nshirt. It had stuck around her armpits with the heat of all these people lying\nto each other. “I got new boots, too. Even combed my hair.” She nervously\ntwisted a stray tangle behind her ear. “But I slept out in a forest for a few\nweeks and it’s refused to behave ever since. How d’you get yours to do…\nall that?”\nThe woman leaned close. “It’s a wig.”\n“Is it?” Rikke stared at those shining braids coiled and piled and swept\nup like a nest of spun gold. “Looks like hair, just… more so.”\n“It is hair. It just isn’t mine.”\n“Doesn’t yours grow?”"

Most of the women here are wearing wigs. It’s the\nfashion.”\nShe said that word, fashion, like it was an explanation for any kind of\nmadness. “Everyone knows that?”\n“Everyone.”\n“So why are we whispering?” whispered Rikke.\n“Well… because everyone knows it, but no one admits it.”\n“So… you shave your heads so you can wear a hat made of someone\nelse’s hair, then lie about it?” Rikke puffed out her cheeks. “Puts my\nworries in some fucking perspective.”\n“Not all of us have the courage for honesty.”\n“Not all of us have the wit to lie.”\nThe woman narrowed her eyes at Rikke. “I doubt you’re lacking wit.”\nRikke narrowed her eyes at the woman. “I doubt you’re lacking\ncourage.”\nShe flinched a little, as if that somehow touched a sore spot, and\nchanged the subject. “I very much like your necklaces, too.”\nRikke tucked her chin into her neck to peer down at the mass of charms\nshe’d collected over the years. Some Gurkish ones, some Northern ones,\nsome shaman’s teeth and this and that. She’d always felt you could never\nhave too much good luck. Seemed a right lot of old junk now. She hooked\nthe well-bitten dowel with her thumb and held it up. “This one’s to bite on\nif I have a fit. Hence the tooth marks.”\nThe woman raised her brows. “Beautiful and practical.”\n“These are runes. My friend Isern-i-Phail carved ’em. Supposed to keep\nme safe. Year I’ve had, though, I doubt they work.”\n“Well, they’re lovely, regardless. I never saw anything like them.”\nShe actually seemed to mean it, and she’d been kind, in a way. “Here.”\nRikke took the runes off and slipped them gently over the woman’s head.\n“Maybe they’ll work better for you.”\n“Thank you,” said Savine, and for once she meant it. It was such a simple,\nforthright gesture, she found herself disarmed. She could hardly remember\nthe last time someone gave her something without expecting double the\nvalue in return.\n“I can get another,” said the Northern girl, waving it away. “Looks much\nbetter on you. You’ve the shoulders for it.”\n“Fencing.”\n“What, sword-work?”\n“It’s fine exercise. Keeps me focused—” She was caught off guard by a\nsudden memory of her sword punching through that man’s ribs, in Valbeck,\nin the gutter. The noise he made as she struggled to pull the blade out of\nhim. She had to shake off an ugly shiver. “Though… perhaps playing with\nswords is a bad idea.”\n“Might be I’ll try an axe instead. Axes are always popular, where I come\nfrom.”\n“I had heard.” And they smiled at each other. Savine told herself she\nfound this girl’s artless ways endearing. The truth, as usual, was less\nsentimental. She did not trust herself to talk to anyone more important."

She’d been sniffing pearl dust\nall day. Just a pinch at sunup to chase off the nightmares. Then a pinch at\nbreakfast to keep her head above water. Maybe a couple more before lunch.\nOnly rather than keeping her sharp, the way it used to, it was making her\ntwitchy and savage and strangely reckless.\n“Here.” She undid the clasp of her necklace. Red Suljuk gold and the\nmost stunning dark emeralds from Thond, beautifully worked by her man in\nOspria at a cost that had raised even her eyebrows. She slipped it around the\ngirl’s neck and fastened it. “I’ll swap you.”\nThe girl stared at it, nestling among that mass of beads, charms and\ntalismans, big eyes bigger than ever. “I can’t take this.”\n“I can get another,” said Savine, waving it away. “It looks far better on\nyou. You have the chest for it.”\n“It looks like a gold ring around a turd.” The girl glanced down Savine’s\nfront. “And you’ve got twice what I’ve got.”\n“I have half what you have and some very expensive corsetry.” Savine\nreached out with both hands, pushed the girl’s unkempt mess of red-brown\nhair out of her face and studied it. Presumptuous, undoubtedly, but she was\nin that kind of mood. “Honestly, you have some remarkable natural\nadvantages.”\n“I’ve a what?” she said, looking slightly scared.\nSavine put a finger under her chin to tip her face into the light. “Fine\nstrong bones. Excellent teeth. And your eyes, of course.” Huge and pale and\nso very expressive. “I’ve never seen anything quite like them.”\nShe flinched a little, as if that somehow touched a sore spot. “Not sure\nwhether they’re a blessing or a curse…”\n“Well, I know women who’d kill for them. Literally. An hour with my\nmaids and I could have every person in here drooling over you.” Savine\ngave the girl’s face a parting pat and let her go, frowning out at the\noblivious gathering. “Just goes to show what a ridiculous lie it is. What a\nridiculous fucking lie everything is.” She realised she had spat that last\nphrase with sudden bitter fury. “Forgive me. I’m being terribly rude.”\n“You’re being amazing, far as I’m concerned.” The girl looked down at\nthe necklace, blushing now, which only made her look better. “My father\nsaw me wearing these, he’d shit himself.”\n“I don’t know what my father would think, but he shits himself\nroutinely.”\nThe girl grinned up. “You’re all right, you know that?”\nAnd Savine felt, of all things, a sudden need to cry. She looked out at the\nHall of Mirrors, blinking back the tears. There was some bald old man she\ncould not quite place, staring right at her like a butcher at a livestock sale."

It was as though there was a hook in\nher throat, and every glimpse of him was a painful tug on it. She was\nashamed to admit it, but she wanted him no less. She certainly wanted to be\nqueen no less. Her one desire was to go over to him and put her hand in his\nand say yes, and kiss him, and hold him, and watch the smile spread across\nhis face…\nAnd marry her brother.\nThe thought disgusted her. But hardly any more than everything\ndisgusted her now. She took a shuddering breath. He was lost to her for\never, and the person she had been with him was lost for ever, and she could\nnot even tell him why. How he must despise her. Almost as much as she\ndespised herself.\n“Lady Savine?”\nShe found, to her horror, that the king was standing right beside her with\nthat haunted, fascinated expression he always had in her presence.\n“Your Majesty.” Savine dropped into a curtsy on an instinct, her face\nsuddenly burning. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the Northern girl\nclumsily trying to imitate her but, in trousers, abjectly failing.\n“I so enjoyed my visit to the Solar Society,” the king was blathering. She\ncould hardly hear the words over the thudding of blood in her head. “So\nimpressed by what you and Master Curnsbick have achieved. The industry,\nthe innovation, the progress. So proud to have… subjects… like you. Young\nladies pointing the way to the future, and so forth—”\n“Please excuse me,” she managed to whisper, turning so fast she almost\nstumbled. She took a wobbling step or two, weak at the knees.\n“I’m Rikke,” she heard the Northern girl yammering behind her.\n“Rhymes with pricker.”\n“The Dogman’s daughter, of course! He was a good friend of my good\nfriend Logen Ninefingers, you know.”\n“Ah, you have to be realistic.”\n“Exactly!”\n“Talking o’ which, my father was saying we were promised six seats on\nthe Open Council…”\nSavine tugged at her corset in a futile attempt to let in some air. She felt\nburied. She was sure she was about to fountain vomit all over the pinnacle\nof society. It was only a sudden, sobering stab of cold rage that stopped her,\nfroze the guilt and fear and left her icy.\nSelest dan Heugen, that sly bitch. She was only twenty paces off, using\nevery weapon in her arsenal on Leo dan Brock, fanning herself as if she was\non fire.\nDid she think she could worm her way into Savine’s place? Steal her\ncanal, her connections, her profits? It was precisely what Savine would have\ndone in her tasteless shoes, of course, but that was only the more reason to\nmake her pay for it."

        "text": "canal, her connections, her profits? It was precisely what Savine would have\ndone in her tasteless shoes, of course, but that was only the more reason to\nmake her pay for it.\nSelest saw her coming, carried across the hall on a wave of poisonous\nfury, and darted to head her off. “Lady Savine! We are all so very glad you\nhave returned to us unhurt.”\n“Lady Selest, you’re such a treasure.”\n“It must have been a terrible ordeal, what you went through.”\nThe temptation to bite her was almost overwhelming. But Savine only\nshrugged. “I was far from the only one who suffered.”\nSelest was pretty, clever and rich, but she led with her chest and smiled\nfar too much. Smile all the time and you’ll make them sick, like a cook\nserving nothing but meringue. Make your smile a rare treat, you’ll leave\nthem desperate to taste another. Savine let Brock see the corner of hers, just\nfor a moment, almost hidden behind her fan.\n“I’m Leo,” he said, with that bluff, blunt Angland accent.\n“Of course you are,” said Savine.\nSelest’s voice dripped with tattletale venom. “Lady Savine was in\nValbeck.”\nAs if Valbeck was some awful secret. She thought to make Savine seem\nruined. But all she would do was make her seem fascinating. Savine would\nsee to it.\n“It’s true,” she said, turning away, biting her lip as though at horrible\nmemories.\nBrock blinked. “During the uprising?”\n“I was visiting a manufactory in which I am… in which I was a part\nowner… when it happened.” She let it hang there for a long time, finally\nmeeting Leo’s eye. As if she would not tell just anyone, but could not hide\nthe truth from him. “The workers turned on us. Several hundred of them. I\nam ashamed to say I locked myself in an office. I heard them overpower the\nguards, heard them set upon my business partner.”\nBrock stared, mouth slightly open. “By the dead…”\nSavine caught a delicious glimpse of doubt on Selest’s face. As she\nrealised that her banal drivel could not possibly compete with this. “I found\na loose board, broke my nails pulling it up. I had to crawl through the\nmachinery to get away, while they smashed down the door above.”\nBrock was spellbound. “That must’ve taken some courage.”\n“Or lucky cowardice, in my case. I saw one of the guards dragged into\nthe machinery. His arm was ripped off in the gears.”\nSelest preened and fluttered in an effort to recapture Brock’s attention,\nbut it was futile. Sometimes pretty lies win the day. But sometimes ugly\ntruths cut deeper. She spoke on, relentless, imagining each word was a slap\nin Selest’s face.\n“I crawled through the guts of the building to the river and squeezed\nbetween a wall and a waterwheel. I found a filthy old coat washed up on the\nriverbank, disguised myself as a beggar and ran. The city was… going mad.\nGangs on the rampage. Prisoners marched in columns. Owners hanged from\njibs. I wish I could say I helped but I was thinking only of myself. Honestly,\nI was hardly thinking at all.”"

Honestly,\nI was hardly thinking at all.”\n“No one could blame you,” said Brock.\n“I was chased through the slums. Through tenements where the husk-\nsmokers lay twelve to a room. Through the filth of the pig pens. Two men\ncornered me in a blind alley…” She remembered that moment.\nRemembered their faces. Now she would turn her terror to her advantage.\nEven Selest looked gripped now, her fan hanging limp.\n“What… happened?” muttered Brock, as if fearing the answer.\n“I had a sword with me. A decorative thing but… sharp.” Savine let the\nsilence stretch an almost uncomfortably long time. A blabbermouth like\nSelest would never understand that drama is not so much a question of\nwords, but of the silences between. “I killed them. Both of them, I think. I\nhardly even chose to do it, but suddenly… it was done.” She took a breath,\nand it caught in her throat, and she let it go, jagged. “They gave me no\nchoice, but… I still think about it. I think about it over and over.”\n“You did what you had to,” whispered Brock.\n“That makes it no easier to live with.”\nSelest’s voice sounded slightly cracked. “Well, you’re back with us now,\nand I for one—”\nBrock spoke over her as if she wasn’t there. “How did you get away?”\n“I stumbled upon some decent people and… they took me in. They kept\nme alive, until Prince Orso delivered the city.” Selest dan Heugen knew\nwhen she was beaten. She snapped her fan open and drifted off. The chill\nsatisfaction of victory was the closest Savine had come to pleasure in some\ntime. She might never be Queen of the Union, but she still reigned supreme\nover the ballroom. “And here I am.”\n“That’s… quite a story,” said Brock.\n“Not compared to facing fearsome warriors in a Circle of shields, I\ndaresay.”\n“Your ordeal went on for weeks. Mine was done in moments.” He\nleaned close, as if sharing his own secret. “Between the two of us, Stour\nNightfall’s the better swordsman.” He brushed the long scab under his eye\nwith a fingertip and Savine realised, with a guilty thrill, that it must be a\nsword-cut. “He could’ve killed me a dozen times. All I did was survive long\nenough for his own arrogance to beat him.”\nShe held up her glass. “To the survivors, then.”\n“I can drink to that.” He had a fine smile. Open, honest, full of excellent\nteeth. Even though the fight was won, Savine found she was still talking to\nhim. More surprising still, she found she was enjoying it. “Your name is\nSavine?”\n“Yes… Savine dan Glokta.” Say what you would for the name, you\ncould always be sure of a reaction. Brock gave an ungainly cough. He really\nhad no disguise at all. “You met my father, then?”\n“All I can say is you got your mother’s looks, and she must be quite the\nbeauty.”"

But with the fight won, the pearl dust\nand the drink closed back in on Savine and she found the prize was an\nextremely handsome man. There truly was something of the lion in his\nsandy hair worn long, his sandy beard cropped short, his confident,\ncomfortable, obvious strength. With that healing cut across his face, he\nlooked like the hero from an overblown storybook. So manly, and so\npopular, and so powerful. Indeed, the young Lord Governor of Angland was\nsurely the most eligible bachelor in the Union at that moment. If you\ndiscounted Crown Prince Orso. Which Savine feared she had to.\n“It must be difficult to be a celebrated hero,” she said. Everyone wants\nto be sympathised with, after all, however little they deserve it.\n“I’ll admit it takes some getting used to.”\n“It must be hard to tell the genuine admiration from the empty breath.\nSurrounded by people, but all alone.” She gave a theatrical sigh. “Everyone\ntrying to make use of you.”\n“Whereas you’ve got my best interests at heart?”\n“I wouldn’t insult your intelligence by pretending anything of the kind.\nBut we might be able to make use of each other.” And she gave Leo another\nsmile. Why not? His blunt, easy manners were the opposite of Orso’s. He\nbrought her no puzzles to solve. His words barely had single meanings, let\nalone double ones. And sometimes a beautiful fool is the very thing one\nneeds.\nSavine was tired of being clever. She wanted to be rash. She wanted to\nhurt someone. Hurt herself. “There is one place in the city you really ought\nto visit while you’re here.”\n“Really?”\n“The office of a friend of mine. A writer. Spillion Sworbreck.”\nBrock looked crestfallen. “I’m… not really much of a reader—”\n“Nor am I, honestly. Sworbreck’s away on a research trip in the Near\nCountry.” She touched Leo on the chest ever so gently with her fan, looking\nup at him from under her lashes. She needed… a little something. “I’ll be\nthere, though.”\nBrock cleared his throat. “Tomorrow?”\n“Now,” said Savine. “Tomorrow I might have changed my mind.” She\nwas probably making a fool of herself. She was probably causing a scandal.\nBut, safe to say, a smaller one than marrying one’s brother.\nOrso stood, and drank.\nWell, to be precise, he stood, and drank, and watched Savine.\nSurreptitiously, to begin with. But less surreptitiously with every drink. Just\nwatching her was torture. Watching her with that square-jawed oaf Leo dan\nBrock was triply so. A torture that for some reason he could not stop\ninflicting on himself.\nPeople were dancing between the two of them, he rather thought, a\nwhole floor full of sparkling, whirling figures, but they were just a drunken"

All he saw was Savine and the Young Lion, laughing. He had thought\nonly he was funny enough to make her laugh that way. It turned out she\ncould do it for entirely unfunny people, too.\nThat she had turned him down was hardly a surprise. But that she would,\nby all appearances, start trying to snare another man—and that one widely\nthought of as his rival—within a few days of turning him down? That hurt.\nHe finished his glass and snatched another from a passing tray. Who was he\nfooling? It all hurt. He was one tremendous wound. One that would never\nheal.\n“And this is my son! The heir to the throne, Crown Prince Orso.”\nOrso turned to find his father in the company of a solidly built old man,\nbald as an egg and with a short grey beard.\n“This is Bayaz,” said the king, with great ceremony. “First of the Magi!”\nHe bore only a passing resemblance to his magnificent statue on the\nKingsway. Rather than a staff, he held a polished cane shod in brass and\ncrystal. Rather than an air of mysterious wisdom, he had an expression of\nhungry self-satisfaction. Rather than arcane robes, he wore the clothes of a\nmodern man of business. One owed a great deal of money by an excellent\ntailor.\nOrso gave a sniff. “You look more like a banker than a wizard.”\n“One must trim one’s style to the times,” said Bayaz, holding up his\ncane and admiring the way the light shone through the crystal knob. “My\nmaster used to say that knowledge is the root of power, but I rather suspect\npower has a golden root these days. We have met before, in fact, Your\nHighness. Though you, I think, cannot have been more than four years old.”\n“He’s barely changed!” said the king, with a suffocatingly false chuckle.\n“I’m afraid I’ve a terrible memory for anything that happened more than\nan hour ago,” said Orso. “Bit of a blur.”\n“I wish I could have been here more,” said Bayaz, “but there are always\nproblems in need of solving. No sooner did I engineer a suspension of\nhostilities with a troublesome brother in the South than two siblings in the\nWest chose to become… difficult.”\n“Family, eh?” grunted Orso, waving his glass at his father, who was\nlooking less comfortable with every word exchanged.\n“The seeds of the past bear fruit in the present,” murmured Bayaz. “The\nwounds of the past, even more so. Then you can’t turn your back on the\nNorth for an hour without at least one war breaking out. Never the slightest\npeace. Still, I hope my erstwhile apprentice Yoru Sulfur was useful in my\nabsence.”\n“Hugely,” swooned the king. “Now if I could just—”\n“Hugely,” echoed Orso, anger stabbing at him through the fug of\ndrunkenness. “Indeed, he made himself useful in the hanging of two\nhundred innocent people. People I had promised amnesty!”\n“Manners, Orso,” murmured the king, through gritted teeth. He was"

People I had promised amnesty!”\n“Manners, Orso,” murmured the king, through gritted teeth. He was\nalways weighed down by cares, but Orso had never seen him look truly\nscared. What did the King of the Union have to fear in his own palace? And\nyet he looked scared now, his face had lost all colour and there was a sheen\nof sweat across his forehead.\n“Let the boy have his fun,” said Bayaz, mildly. “We all were young\nonce, eh? Even if, in my case, it was a very long time ago. In due course, he\nwill learn how the world really works. Just as you did.” And with a smile,\nthe First of the Magi turned away.\n“You shouldn’t indulge that old fool,” grumbled Orso.\n“You weren’t there.” The king’s fingers dug painfully into his wrist.\n“When the Eaters came. You didn’t see… what he is capable of.” His eyes\nhad the strangest, haunted look. “You must promise me never to defy him.”\nOrso tried to twist his arm free. “What are you talking about—”\n“You must promise me!”\n“A word, Your Majesty!” called Bayaz, and with one backward glance,\nthe king hurried after the magus like a dog called to heel. Orso took another\nswallow of wine, then turned back towards Savine, still laughing with the\nYoung Lion.\nHe would have been furious with her, but he could no more hate her than\na drunk can the bottle. He would have been furious with Leo dan Brock, but\nhe had done nothing wrong, the horribly but justifiably vain, magnificently\nmanly, utterly superficial bastard. He was doing exactly what Orso would\nhave done in his place, only looking like a hero while he did it.\nThe only person in this triangle of misery he could reasonably be furious\nwith was himself. He had ruined it all, somehow. By being too backward, or\ntoo forward, too slow or too fast or too something. He knew most people\nscorned him utterly, but for some reason, though she was the cleverest,\nbravest, most beautiful woman in the world, she had not. He had let himself\nbelieve that she loved him. But it was just another trick. A trick he had\nplayed on himself.\n“Women,” he muttered, helplessly.\n“I know,” came a voice beside him. “Fucking bitches.”\nIt was that Northern girl. The Dogman’s daughter, Rikke. He had seen\nher from a distance and thought she looked interesting, with the wild hair\nand the twitchy gestures and the total lack of usual propriety. Up close, she\nwas a great deal more interesting. She had, for some reason, a heavy gold\nring through her nose, and some streaks of dark paint on her freckled face,\nand a beguiling hint of cleavage showing among a rattling mass of\nnecklaces and talismans that included a rather wonderful and entirely\nincongruous set of emeralds. But most of all it was her eyes, big and pale\nand piercing. He felt as if she saw right into him, and wasn’t repulsed by\nwhat she found there. Which was welcome, because he certainly was.\nHell, he was drunk."

And here, as if by magic…\n“I sometimes think no one in this city can tell the truth for three breaths\ntogether.” He waved his glass at the room and slopped some wine onto the\ntiles. “But you seem…honest.”\n“And so funny.”\n“And so funny.”\n“Who the hell are all these bastards?”\n“Well…he’s the court clockmaker. And she’s a famous actress. That bald\nidiot is a legendary wizard, apparently. I’m told that woman there is a\nStyrian spy. One of the ones we pretend not to know about.”\nRikke sighed. “I’m like an angry chicken trying to pass myself off\namong swans.”\n“I’ve tried swan, as it happens. Thoroughly mediocre meat, once the\nfeathers are off.” She might not have worn lady’s clothes but without doubt\nthere was a woman’s shape underneath, and one he found not the slightest\nfault with. “A good chicken, on the other hand…”\n“A man of taste, eh?”\n“It has been remarked upon.”\n“I’m told you’re the heir to all this.”\n“A sad fact.”\nShe puffed out her cheeks as she glanced about the Hall of Mirrors. “All\nthis wealth and flattery must be… such a curse.”\n“It’s made me the useless cunt I am.”\n“You can’t argue with those results.”\n“I’m told you’re a witch who can see the future.”\n“Witch, no. Future, sometimes.” She winced, pressed a hand to her left\neye as though it hurt. “A bit too much, lately.”\n“What’s the ring for?” he asked.\n“Keeps me tethered to the earth.”\n“Or you’ll float off?”\n“I’m prone to fits.” She thought about that, then snorted laughter and\nblew some snot onto her top lip. “And shits,” she said as she wiped it away.\n“I’m told you’ve bedded five thousand whores.”\n“I’d be amazed if it’s more than four thousand nine hundred.”\n“Huh.” She gave him a long, lazy, utterly shameless look up and down.\nA look that no one within thirty paces could have doubted the meaning of.\nA look that made him feel at once slightly embarrassed and rather aroused.\n“They teach you anything?”\nHe realised he had not even glanced at Savine since they started talking.\nHe looked over now.

He’d seen the street sign. He’d seen the number.\n“This is the place,” he whispered, breath smoking in the chilly night.\nIt was a tall terraced house, a little smoke-blackened, just like a dozen\nothers in this street, which was just like a dozen other streets on the way\nfrom the Agriont. Not the most exciting building. But a chink of light shone\nbetween shutters in an upstairs window, and Leo felt almost as skittish\nlooking up at it as he had towards that bridge on the day of the battle, ready\nto order the charge.\n“Thanks for the directions,” he said. “You’re a good friend. The best. I’ll\nsee you tomorrow. At the parade.” When he turned, grinning, Jurand had the\nstrangest look on his face. Shocked. Dismayed.

Of course.”\n“Cheer up.” Leo hugged him roughly with one arm, looking back to the\nbuilding. The one lit window. “There are plenty of ladies for all of us.”\nThough he couldn’t think of any close to Savine dan Glokta’s class.\n“Plenty of ladies,” Jurand echoed, gloomily. “I hope you know what\nyou’re getting into.”\n“Sometimes it’s better if you don’t.” And Leo handed Jurand his cane,\ngave him a parting poke in the stomach, then strutted across the street,\ntrying not to let the pain show.

He knew a bit about courage, and the secret is to dismiss\nthe whole notion of choice and just do. He lifted his fist and gave four smart\nknocks, twisting his face into the kind of self-assured smoulder he imagined\nthe great lovers of history might’ve used.\nIt slipped straight off when the door opened. There was a dark-skinned\nwoman on the other side he’d never seen before.\n“Oh… I was expecting—”\n“You must be the Young Lion,” she said in common that probably had\nless accent than his.\n“Some people call me that—”\nShe snapped her teeth at him with a surprisingly lion-like growl and he\njerked back in surprise, winced as his weight went on his wounded leg and\ntried to pass it off with a false chuckle as she let him past, leaning back\nagainst the door until it clunked shut. “Lady Savine is upstairs.”\n“Upstairs. Of course.” He found he was blushing, which probably\nwasn’t something the great lovers of history would’ve done. “I mean, not\nthat, I just mean… I’m not much of a talker.”\n“No doubt God gave you other talents.” And she turned away with the\nslightest smile.\nIt seemed a long way up that darkened staircase, his heart beating so\nloud they could’ve heard it in the street, the chink of light below the black\ndoor getting steadily closer, promising so much. He’d no idea what to\nexpect. Wouldn’t have shocked him to find Savine waiting with a loaded\nflatbow. Or stretched out naked on a tiger skin. Or both, for that matter.\nHe paused outside the door, trying to catch his breath, but it refused to\nbe caught. Too cold outside, too warm in here. He thought about knocking,\nthen realised it might be more masterful if he just swept in. They didn’t call\nhim the Young Lion for nothing, after all. Reckless charges were his\ntrademark. He reached for the knob, paused at a rush of nerves, then\nbundled too eagerly through.\nSavine stood, pouring wine in the light of one lamp, as precisely posed\nas if she was standing for a portrait. She didn’t even flinch as the door\nopened, didn’t even turn to look at him, just held the glass up to the light,\nfrowning slightly as she checked the colour. “You made it, then?” she\nasked, finally turning towards him.\n“Yes.” He clutched for something witty to add but the cupboard was\nbare. She looked even more immaculate than he remembered. Her shape\nagainst the lamplight—almost impossibly—what? Where else would words\nfail you but in a bloody writer’s office?\nHe looked around, hoping to find some inspiration. Shelves burst with\nbooks, a leather-topped desk was strewn with papers. What might’ve been a\nprinting press stood in one corner, about the ugliest thing Leo had ever\nseen, all iron gears and handles, a blackened roller and one printed page\nlying in its open jaws.\n“Sworbreck’s latest tissue of fantasies,” said Savine. “But you didn’t\ncome to hear about other people’s adventures.”"

Some hint of\nhunger, or anger, or madness, even, that made him very excited and slightly\nafraid. Or maybe the other way around. He found himself shrinking back,\nended up pressed awkwardly against the desk, the moulded edge jabbing\nhim in the arse.\nBy the dead, even the most thick-headed man in Adua—and Leo\ncounted himself in the running—couldn’t have doubted what she was after.\nProbably there’d never been any doubt, but for some reason, he’d let\nhimself think she might really want to give him a tour of a writer’s office.\nHere the pens, there the ink, now we can all go back to our separate beds\nand have a lovely sleep, entirely untroubled by worries over one’s abilities\nas a lover.\nIf anyone asked, Leo would always say he adored the ladies. But there’d\nbeen times when he worried that women didn’t quite…excite him the way\nthey should. The way they did other men. Now it seemed his problem had\nsimply been finding the right one. Rikke had been such easy company. One\nof the boys. Savine could scarcely have been more the opposite. He’d never\nmet a woman who was more…woman.\n“Nervous?” she asked.\n“No,” he lied. His voice cracked a bit and she smiled. A hard little smile,\nas though she’d caught him out. Which she had, of course. He’d never been\nmuch of a liar.\nThe truth was, Leo had never been that comfortable around women. But\nperhaps comfortable is the last thing romance should be. Perhaps it should\nhave an edge. And every moment with Savine felt as thrilling and\ndangerous as stepping into the Circle with the Great Wolf.\n“I… don’t think I ever met a woman like you before,” he said.\n“Of course not.” She threw her wine back in one easy motion, thin\nmuscles in her neck fluttering as she swallowed. “I’m the only one.” And\nshe tossed the glass onto the leather top of the desk, where it rattled on its\nedge but by some sorcery stayed upright. She eased closer, pale chest rising\nand falling, soft skin gleaming with the lamplight and—\nShe was wearing a necklace that didn’t fit at all with her flawless\ntailoring. A twisted thong with bone tablets threaded onto it, jaggedly\ncarved. The kind of thing Rikke used to wear in a rattling mass. Even\nthrough the drink and the excitement, that gave him a twinge of guilt.\n“Where did you get the runes?”\n“From the North,” she said, vaguely, her eyes on his mouth.\n“What do they say?” He wasn’t doing anything wrong, was he? Rikke\nhad made it perfectly clear she wanted nothing more to—"

Rikke\nhad made it perfectly clear she wanted nothing more to—\nSavine took him by the chin with a force that wasn’t to be resisted.\n“Who cares?” Her thumbtip crept up his cheek, her narrowed eyes fixed on\nit, and the tip of her tongue showed between her lips as she found the fresh\nscar, stroked it gently, a little tickly, a little sore.\n“Did Stour Nightfall give you this?” she asked.\n“With a few other keepsakes.”\n“Does it hurt?”\n“Only if you press—ah!” She very deliberately pressed it, her teeth\nsavagely bared for an instant, and made him flinch away, twisted even more\nuncomfortably over the desk.\nHe could hardly believe how slight she was, how slender, the sinews\ntwitching in her bare shoulder. He hardly dared to touch her in case she\nsnapped in his hands. But she was stronger than he’d expected. Far stronger.\nFar warmer. He caught a waft of her scent, mostly summer meadow, but\nwith some harsh animal edge in it. He might’ve been more scared than\nexcited but without doubt his cock was the other way around.\nHis throat was so tight he could hardly speak. He found himself\nwondering how much older she was than him. Five years? Ten? How much\nmore experienced…“Are you sure this is a good idea—”\n“I’m sure it’s a terrible idea. That’s its appeal.” She flipped open a little\nbox, brought out a pinch of something between finger and thumb and lifted\nit to his face. She found a way to do even that gracefully. “Here.”\n“What is it?”\n“Pearl dust.”\n“The stuff artists use to make them more sensitive?”\n“What works for artists works just as well for the rest of us. They’re\nreally a great deal less special than they like to think. Just sniff it.”\n“I’m not sure I—”\n“I thought you came for an adventure?” And she pressed that pinch of\npowder to one of his nostrils while she squeezed the other shut with a\nfingertip. He really had no choice but to snort it up. The time for choices\nhad been in the street outside—.\n“Ah, by the dead!” Fire burned to the back of his throat, out into his\nears, down into his teeth, brought tears to his eyes. A horrible sensation.\n“Why the hell would anyone—”\n“Other side,” she hissed, twisting his head and near shoving her fingers\nup his other nostril. He hardly even knew she was undoing his sword-belt\nuntil he heard it clatter to the floor. Disarmed in every sense.\nBloody hell, he wanted to sneeze, stood for a moment with eyes closed,\ntrying to smother it. When the urge passed, he found she was kissing him,\ngentle little nips at his mouth, then she twisted his face side on to hers,\nstarted lapping, sucking, biting at him.\nHe squeezed at her ribs but couldn’t really feel her, just a fortress of\ncorsetry, stiff as armour. The burning in his face was fading, his head\npleasantly spinning. His mouth moved mechanically, numb and clumsy."

His mouth moved mechanically, numb and clumsy.\nLips all fizzy. He could taste wine on her tongue.\nWhether it was her, or the drink, or the stuff for artists up his nose, Leo\ncouldn’t say, but he’d started to feel bold. Wild. He was the bloody Young\nLion, wasn’t he? He’d come for a fucking adventure! He was one of\nhistory’s great lovers, damn it!\nHe gave a lion’s growl as he caught her face, thumb under her jaw,\ncaught the strap of her dress and gripped it, twisted it, his knuckles pressing\nhard into her shoulder, making her gasp, turning her, until he was the one\nshoving her up against the edge of the desk. He caught his foot on his\nsword, staggered, and she kicked it away with one pointed shoe, blade half\nfalling out of the scabbard as it clattered into the lion-carved feet of the\nprinting press.\nHis face didn’t hurt any more. Not one bit. He could hardly feel a thing\nfrom the neck up, but twice as much as usual from the waist down.\nShe grunted in her throat, lips curled back into something between a\nsmile and a snarl as she nipped at him with her teeth. He felt her fumbling\nwith his belt, dragging it open, felt his trousers sagging down until they\nwere tangled with his boots. The air was cool on his arse, then her hand\neven cooler.\nAny thought of saying no was long gone. Any thought at all, for that\nmatter.\nShe wriggled nimbly back onto the desk, almost as if she’d had a lot of\npractice, skirts rustling as she pulled them up, pulled them up, and she\ndragged him after her, hand twisted in his hair.\nAlmost painful, but not quite.\nSubstitutes\n“B\ny the dead,” groaned Rikke.\nShe propped herself up on her elbows, tried to blow free the hair tangled\nacross her face and failed. She had to drag it back with her fingers, squeeze\nher stinging eyes shut against the light then bit by tiny bit peel open just the\none.\nShe was lying with a sheet tangled around her hips, one leg sticking out,\nwhich she knew must be hers ’cause she could wriggle the toes. She was\nstark naked but for her shirt, the sleeve all rucked up around one wrist and\nthe rest spread out limp across the bed like a flag of surrender.\nShe frowned past the shirt, towards the window, then jerked up, staring\nabout.\nWhere the bloody hell was she?\nThe room was big as a chieftain’s hall, acres of rich-coloured drapery\nstirring about the great windows. The far-off ceiling was all crusted with\ngilded leaves, the furniture all polished to a blinding sheen, the door high\nenough to be used by giants with a knob shaped like the sun of the Union.\nIt turned, and the door shuddered open as if from a kick.\nSomeone came in with a silver tray teetering on one hand, things sliding\ndangerously about on top.

His crimson jacket, heavy with gold stitching,\nhung open to show a strip of pale and slightly hairy chest and belly. He\nturned slowly towards the bed, concentrating furiously on keeping his tray\nbalanced.\nIt was Crown Prince Orso.\n“Oh.” Rikke felt her eyebrows go very high then, as that last part of last\nnight suddenly came rushing back. “Oh…” She’d been about to cover up,\nbut now there didn’t seem much point, so she just flopped back, arms\noutstretched.\n“You’re awake,” he said, grinning.\n“So you say,” she croaked out. “How much did I drink?”\n“All of it, I think.” He put the tray down proudly on the bed beside her.\n“I brought you an egg.”\nShe lifted her chin a little to give it the eye. Her guts had felt far from\nsettled ever since Leo’s duel. They felt less settled than ever now. “Well\ndone. Lay it yourself, did you?”\n“There’s no point being a crown prince if you mean to do all the hard\nwork. But look, I carried it from the door to the bed.” And he gestured at the\npath he’d taken. “As you observed last night, fucking a crown prince is no\ngreat distinction, even if you did it rather bloody well—”\nShe gave a humble shrug. “I’ve a gift, what can I say?”\n“—but being brought breakfast by one, that is a rare honour.”\nShe had to admit to feeling a little bit honoured. She wasn’t sure anyone\nhad brought her breakfast before. Leo certainly never bothered. The thought\nwould never penetrate his thick skull that there were needs in the world\nother than his. She wondered where he was, now. With that hideously\nbeautiful woman, more than likely, who she couldn’t even hate on account\nof the absurdly generous gift of green jewels that were right now gleaming\non her chest.\n“What’s this?” she asked, fishing a crumpled sheaf of papers from the\ntray. She was no expert on printing but she reckoned this a poor example.\n“It’s a newsbill. They tell you what’s happening.” Orso thought about\nthat. “Or they tell you what to think about what’s happening.” He thought\nmore. “Or the really successful ones just confirm what you already think\nabout what’s happening.”\n“Huh.” There was a smudged etching on the front of Leo on horseback\nlooking even more pompous than usual. There must’ve been half a page\nabout exactly how he trimmed his beard. Then there was something about\nBreakers rampaging, trouble in the South, rivalries with Styria, how\nimmigrants had ruined the tone of a neighbourhood, how everything was\nbetter during the reign of King Casamir…\nShe gave a disbelieving snort. “Hear this shit. ‘His Highness was\nobserved leaving the function in the company of the beautiful and\nmysterious Witch of the North…’”\n“Now, that is poor writing.” Orso ever so gradually leaned towards her\nas he spoke, eyes fixed earnestly on her face. “It should say beautiful,\nmysterious, shapely, cunning, talented, highly entertaining—”"

A\nscuzzy and sour-tasting kiss, but if you hold off till everything’s perfect,\nthink of all the great kisses you’ll miss.\n“You’re not quite what I was expecting,” she said as they broke apart.\n“Even more handsome in the flesh, eh?”\n“Handsome, I expected. Kind, I didn’t.”\n“Kind?” He gave a her a strange look. “That might be the nicest thing\nanyone’s ever said about me.” He peered up at the ceiling. “Now I’m\nwondering if it’s the only nice thing anyone’s ever said about me. I could\nshow you the city!” He jumped up from the bed with an enthusiasm that\nmade her head hurt. “Adua! City of White Towers! It’s the centre of the\nworld, you know.”\n“So I hear.”\n“The theatre! I can get the place cleared. Arrange a private showing, just\nfor the two of us.”\n“Folk acting out silly stories? All magic and wars and romance? Don’t\nreckon that’s for me.”\n“Cards, then. Do you play cards?”\n“Not sure it’d be fair. I’ve got the Long Eye, remember?”\nHis eyes went wide, like a boy who’s found a fine new game. “Even\nbetter! I can finally wipe the smirk off that bastard Tunny’s face at the\ngaming table!”\n“Thought you had a parade to lead?”\nOrso’s mouth twisted. “I don’t deserve a parade. Unless it happened to\nbe stomping over me, I suppose.” And he flopped down on his back, staring\nup at the gilded leaves on the ceiling.\n“Thought you crushed some rebellion?”\n“Oh, yes, the heroic crown prince. I talked some labourers into\nsurrendering.”\n“Well, that’s something to celebrate. Saved some lives, didn’t you?”\n“I did.” He turned to look at her. “Then they all got hanged.”\nRikke stared up at the ceiling herself. “Ah.”\n“I didn’t make it happen. But I didn’t stop it, either. Some hero, eh?”\n“I’m told a leader has to make o’ their heart a stone.” Rikke sat up and\nplucked the egg out of its cup. “At least you know what y’are.” And she bit\nthe top off it.\n“I’m no Young Lion. I think we can agree on that.”\n“Thank the dead.” And she grinned, showing him a mouthful of egg\nmush. “Man’s a fucking arsehole.”\nHe grinned back. “Do you know, I don’t think I ever met a woman like\nyou before.”\n“And you’ve met so many.”\n“Honestly, my reputation in that regard is hugely inflated.”\n“Hugely inflated, eh? Perhaps you’re more like Leo dan Brock than you\nthink.” She leaned over to grab a slice of bread off the tray, and there was a\nrattle as the door was flung carelessly open."

Didn’t take long for Rikke to realise it was Orso’s mother. Her August\nMajesty the High Queen of the Union. She gave a kind of helpless squeak.\nMight’ve done better if she hadn’t just wedged a piece of bread in her wide-\nopen mouth, but she doubted it.\n“Who is this… person?” asked the queen.\n“Er… this is Rikke. The beautiful and mysterious Witch of the North!”\nOrso attempted an ornamental flourish, as though she was being presented\nto the throne rather than caught in his bed, and Rikke coughed and almost\nblew bread out of her nose. “She is an emissary from the Protectorate.”\nRikke wasn’t sure whether he’d made her look better or the Protectorate\nworse. She took the bread out of her mouth, shut it, then pinched the sheet\nbetween finger and thumb and ever so gradually pulled it up over her tits.\nThe queen made an arch of one perfect brow. “When it comes to\nbuilding close diplomatic ties with the future King of the Union, one cannot\nfault her commitment.”\nRikke cleared her throat. “Well, it’s a key alliance for us.” Orso\nsmothered a laugh. His mother didn’t. Rikke thought about just keeping on\npulling the sheet until it was all the way over her head.\n“Tell me this isn’t the girl you’re thinking of marrying, Orso?”\nRikke stared at him. “You’re getting—”\n“No!” Orso gave a pained wince. “That was… all a misunderstanding.”\nThe queen sighed heavily. “It says something for the scale of my\ndesperation that I was entirely prepared to welcome her into the family.”\nAnd she swept out, shutting the door behind her with a precise click.\nRikke puffed out her cheeks. “By the dead. Your mother’s got a stare\ncould curdle milk.”\n“I think she rather took to you,” said Orso. “And it’s a hell of a\ncompliment. When it comes to naked women, she’s quite the connoisseur.”\n“I’d best get dressed.” Rikke sat up, peering about for her trousers. “In\ncase your father comes wandering in next.”\n“I’m guessing it doesn’t take you too long?”\nRikke glanced down at herself. “Get my boots on and I’m pretty much\nthere.”\n“Wonderful.” Orso was looking down at her, too, the ghost of a smile\nabout his lips. He brushed her neck with a fingertip, then slid it down until it\ncaught the hem of the sheet, and started to drag that down, too. “We may be\nable to fit in a brief round of diplomacy before the parade.”\n“Well… I was sent to improve relations with the Union.” And she\nkicked the tray clattering off onto the floor, spat a bit of egg after it, grabbed"

The streets were canyons of humanity, the squares were seas of\nfaces. Just when Leo thought there couldn’t be any more in the world,\nthey’d turn a corner and another avenue would open up, smiles stretching\ninto the distance. His wounded side was sore from all the riding, his\nwounded arm from all the waving, his wounded face from all the grinning.\n“Are they taking them from the back and rushing them to the front down\nside streets, or something?”\n“Bearing in mind my mother organised this,” said Orso, “I wouldn’t be\nat all surprised.”\nThe parade itself must’ve been several thousand strong. At the front rode\nmagnates of the Open Council, garlanded with braid and medals. Leo got an\napproving nod from Lord Isher as he glanced over his shoulder. An\nenergetically shaken fist from Barezin. A self-satisfied salute from Heugen.\nFurther back were lesser aristocracy, officers of the army and fur-\ntrimmed bureaucrats. Wedged between them and the glittering ranks of\ntramping soldiers were a group of ambassadors, emissaries and foreign\nworthies with a daunting array of skin tones and national costumes.\nLeo realised with a twinge of guilt that Rikke was probably among\nthem. He wondered what she’d done after the ball last night. Probably sat\non her own in the darkness, plotting his doom. He turned his eyes hastily\nforward, towards the magnificent standard flying at the very head of the\ncolumn, its white horse rearing against a golden sun. Just the sight of it\nmade the embers of Leo’s patriotic fervour flare back into life. A relic of a\nbetter time, when the Union was ruled by righteous warriors, not copper-\ncounting cripples.\n“The Steadfast Standard,” he murmured, in a voice hushed with awe.\nOrso nodded. “The very piece of cloth that fluttered at the head of\nCasamir’s conquering armies.”\n“Without him there’d be no Angland at all. Now there was a great king.”\n“Indeed.” The crown prince sighed. “Makes one realise how terribly far\nthe monarchy has fallen.”\n“I didn’t mean—”\n“Don’t worry,” said Orso, with a sad little smile. He looked sad in\ngeneral, considering this was all partly in his honour. “No one has a lower\nopinion of the royal family than me, and that is with some savage\ncompetition. Makes you wonder, though, doesn’t it? Whether Casamir and\nHarod and the rest were really the great men history paints them as. Or were\nthey just yesterday’s mediocrities, bloated up with centuries of stolen credit\ninto today’s towering heroes?” He gestured to the crowds. “I mean, it’s you\nthey’re here for. You’re the one defeated Stour Nightfall. Men are wearing"

Wearing their swords like you. There’s a play about\nyour duel, I believe.”\n“Any good?”\n“I’m sure it’s less exhilarating than the original.”\nLeo had to admit he quite liked the crown prince. He’d expected him to\nbe a real wilting dandy and, yes, you wouldn’t have called him a man’s\nman, but there was no doubt he was a damn good-looking fellow, and he\nturned out to be really quite thoughtful and generous. A hard man to hate.\nLeo was learning that people and their reputations rarely had much in\ncommon. He found himself, ironically, joining the Arch Lector in trying to\ninflate Orso’s achievements.\n“You liberated Valbeck, Your Highness. Put down a bloody rebellion.”\n“I surrounded a city and had a very good breakfast, discussed terms and\nhad a very good lunch, accepted a surrender and had a very good dinner,\nthen found the majority of my prisoners already hanged when I got up the\nnext morning. My own fault for being a late riser, I suppose.”\n“But you’re the heir to the throne—”\n“My parents might agree on nothing else, but they do agree on that.\nBeing heir to the throne takes no effort, however. Believe me, I know. You,\non the other hand, have risked your life.” He waved a hand towards the scar\non Leo’s face. “Covered with the red marks of bravery! My most serious\nwound was sustained when I struck my head getting out of bed dead drunk.\nThe bleeding was quite spectacular, to be fair, but the glory was minimal.”\nLeo’s eye was caught by a knot of dark-skinned beggars in the crowd.\n“Lot of brown faces around,” he said, frowning.\n“Troubles in the South. Refugees are pouring across the Circle Sea,\nseeking new lives.”\n“Fought a war against the Gurkish thirty years ago, didn’t we? You sure\nthey can be trusted?”\n“Some can and some can’t, I would’ve thought. Just like Northmen. Just\nlike anyone. And they’re not all from Gurkhul.”\n“Where, then?”\n“All across the South,” said Orso. “Kadir, Taurish, Yashtavit, Dagoska.\nDozens of languages. Dozens of cultures. And they’ve chosen to come here.\nMakes you proud, doesn’t it?”\n“If you say so.” Leo knew nothing about those places except that he\ndidn’t want the Union to become one of them. He took no pride in the\nwatering down of his homeland’s character. “Don’t you worry there might\nbe…” Leo felt a need to lower his voice. “Eaters among them?”\n“I’m not sure cannibal sorcerers are one of our most pressing problems.”\n“Some of them can steal people’s faces. That’s what I heard.” Leo\ncraned around to frown at those Southerners again. “They can disguise\nthemselves as anyone.”\n“Then wouldn’t a pale face make a better disguise than a dark?”\nLeo frowned. He hadn’t actually thought of that. “Just… hardly feels\nlike the Union’s the Union any more.”"

He hadn’t actually thought of that. “Just… hardly feels\nlike the Union’s the Union any more.”\n“Surely the great strength of the Union has always been its variety.\nThat’s why they call it a Union.”\n“Huh,” grunted Leo. Orso would think that. He was a half-Styrian\nmongrel himself. Something landed in his lap. A flower. Looking towards\nan upstairs window, he saw a group of smiling girls, tossing down more. He\ngrinned and blew them a kiss. Seemed the only decent thing to do.\n“Adua appears to be enjoying you,” said Orso. “How have you been\nenjoying it?”\n“Can’t say I take to the vapours. And the politics is pretty murky, too.\nSince the Closed Council didn’t help fight the war, I’d hoped they’d at least\nhelp pay for it.”\n“Easier to open a gate to hell, in my experience, than the king’s purse.”\n“A royal waste of my time. But, on the other hand… I met a woman.\nNever met one quite like her before.”\nOrso gave a sharp little laugh. “Fancy that. So did I.”\n“Beautiful. Clever. Sharp as a dagger and fierce as a tiger.”\nAnother laugh. “Fancy that. So did I.”\n“But so poised, so elegant… every inch the lady.”\nOrso laughed louder than ever. “Well, there we differ. Does your\nparagon of womanhood have a name?”\nLeo cleared his throat. “Reckon I’d better not say.”\n“Went further than just a meeting, then?”\n“She took me to…” No, no, that sounded too weak. “I met her, I should\nsay, at the office of some writer.” The prince’s face gave an ugly twitch.\nEven less keen on books than Leo was, maybe. “But… she didn’t invite me\nto read, if you take my meaning.”\n“I think I can deduce it.” Orso’s voice sounded strangled, but Leo had\nnever been much good at finding the hidden meaning in things. He was a\nstraightforward fellow. So he carried on. Straightforwardly. Was that a\nword?\n“A night of passion… with a beautiful and mysterious older woman.”\n“Surely every young man’s dream,” grated Orso.\n“Yes, except…” Leo wasn’t sure if he should say more. But Orso was a\nman of the world. Infamously so. Maybe he could help make sense of it? “If\nthe story got out, people might think I made use of her, but… I’ve a feeling\nshe made use of me.”\n“We all want to be wanted,” growled Orso, eyes fixed ahead.\n“The way she looked at me.” As if he was her next meal. “The way she\ntouched me.” With no gentleness and no doubts. “The way she spoke to\nme.” Knowing just what she wanted and not caring a damn for what he\nmight.

Could it be… deep down… he liked being spoken to that way?\n“You know,” said Orso, checking his mount, “I really shouldn’t be\nhere.”\n“What?”\n“You deserve it. I don’t.” Orso clapped him on the arm and, without\nwaiting for a reply, pulled his horse to the side and began to drop back.\nTill then there’d been the odd false note in the applause. Boos, mocking\ncalls of, “Young lamb,” even outright screeches of, “Murderer!” But when\nOrso left, he took all criticism with him, and with Leo leading the parade\nalone, riding beneath the Steadfast Standard just as Casamir himself\nmight’ve, the cheering was twice as loud. The flower petals fell in\nfountains. Urchins pointed fingers, eyes wide in dirt-smudged faces. There\ngoes the Young Lion, saviour of the Union!\nLeo smiled. It wasn’t hard to do. Orso was right, after all. He did\ndeserve the glory.\nHow many people can say they won a war single-handed?\nEveryone had cheered for Leo dan Brock, up on his own at the front of the\nparade, a famous hero from head to toe. Things quietened down a lot as the\ngreat men of the Open Council followed.\n“That’s fucking Isher,” growled Broad as he rode past with his chin in\nthe air, great gilded cloak spread out across the hindquarters of his prancing\nhorse. “The one who stole our land. Looks like he’s done all right out of it,\nthe—”\n“Let it go.” Liddy’s hand was gentle on the back of his. Gentle but firm.\n“Your anger won’t hurt him any, but it could hurt us.”\n“Aye,” said Broad, taking a hard breath. “You’re right.” It had hurt them\nenough already.\nFur-trimmed worthies followed the lords, trying to steal a piece of glory\nthey’d had no part in winning. Next came the officers, and Broad turned his\nhead and spat. After what he’d been through in Styria, he liked those\nbastards no better than the lords.\n“There’s Orso!” called a child up on shoulders.\n“Why’s he back here?”\n“Shamed to show his face beside a real hero,” someone grumbled.\nBroad saw him, now. Sat on a fine grey in this loose, relaxed way like he\ndidn’t know what guilt was, an odd little smirk at the corner of his mouth as\nhe chatted to some old soldier in a fine fur hat.\n“Shame!” someone roared. “Down wi’ the crown prince!” A tall man\nwith a thick black beard, standing on tiptoe to shout over the heads of those\nin front. Folk frowned around at him but he’d the light of madness in his\neyes and didn’t back down a step. “Murderer!”\nLiddy shook her head. “Damn fool will only cause trouble.”\n“Got a point, though,” muttered Broad. “Orso is a bloody murderer.”\n“Didn’t Valbeck teach you any lessons at all, Gunnar? You can have a\npoint and still keep it to yourself.”"

Inquisition are\neverywhere.”\nThat bearded bastard didn’t seem to care. “Shit on the Young Lamb!” he\nbellowed through cupped hands, and Orso looked over with that faint, bored\nsmile, and gave a little bow, and there was some scattered laughter which\nBroad had to admit took a little venom out of the gathering.\nMoments later, someone barged his shoulder and three black-clothed\nmen shoved through the crowd. The bearded heckler saw them, spun about,\nbut another two were coming the other way. The crowd surged back as if\nfrom a plague victim as the Practicals caught him, shoved him down,\nstarted forcing a stained bag over his head.\n“No!” hissed Liddy. Was only then Broad noticed her hand on his arm.\nBoth hands, dragging him back as hard as she could. “No more trouble!”\nWas only then he noticed his every muscle was stiff and his fists clenched\ntrembling tight and his lips curled back in a snarl.\n“Don’t you dare fuck this up for us!” May had slipped in front of him,\nwas stabbing her pointed finger in his face. “Not when we just got right!”\nThere were tears glimmering in her eyes. “Don’t you dare!”\nBroad took a deep breath and let it shudder away. Watched as three\nPracticals manhandled that poor fool through the crowd. Could’ve been\nhim, dragged off to the House of Questions. Would’ve been him, gibbetted\nbeside the road to Valbeck, if it hadn’t been for May and the biggest slice of\nluck an undeserving man ever got.\n“I won’t, May.” He felt tears in his own eyes then, eased his lenses down\nhis nose to rub them dry. “I’m sorry.”\n“You promised us,” hissed Liddy, dragging him back towards the\ntramping men, and the high-stepping horses, and the flags and shiny metal.\n“No more trouble.”\n“No more trouble.” Broad put his arms around his wife and his daughter,\nand held them both close. “I promise.”\nBut his fists were still so tightly clenched, they ached.\nSavine had always loved grand events. The bigger the crowd, the more\nopportunities to turn strangers into acquaintances, acquaintances into\nfriends, and friends into money.

A mountain one must claw and strive\nand scramble always to keep one’s place upon, let alone to climb higher. A\nmountain made not of rock, but of everyone else’s writhing, struggling,\ngrasping bodies.\nEvents came no grander than this one. A holiday had been declared for\nthe working folk of Adua and the furnaces had been doused and the vapours\ncleared. It was warm for the start of winter, the sun shining crisp upon the\nrevelling crowds. Those of the great and good who had not joined the\nfamous victors on their parade were gathered here at the end of the route,\nalong with a multitude of the small and bad, in the Square of Marshals.\nSavine was at the heart of it, at one end of the purple-swagged royal\nbox, along with most of the Closed Council, a legion of toadying footmen\nand stern Knights of the Body, not to mention Their August Majesties the\nHigh King and Queen of the Union. Terez stood painfully erect at the very\npinnacle of power, honouring the crowd with the occasional scornful wave,\nunquestioned mistress of all she saw. For once, Savine did not need to make\nan effort to be jealous. That could have been her place. Should have been.\nAlmost had been.\nThe king glanced sideways and, just for an instant, caught Savine’s eye.\nThat same sad, needy look, and she stared down at her very fine shoes. She\nhad no idea why she should be embarrassed. She was not the one who had\nfucked her mother and abandoned the results. But still her face burned.\nShe had always loved grand events, but she hated everything and\neveryone today, and herself most of all. She missed Orso like an arm cut\noff. She would think of some observation only he would understand, and\nsmile, and turn to Zuri to arrange a meeting… and then that sappy pang of\nloss all over again.\nLeo dan Brock had been a pleasing diversion. From the neck down, he\nwas astonishing. When she opened his shirt, she had spent a moment just\nstaring. It was as if he was carved from flesh-coloured marble by a sculptor\nintent on exaggeration. There had been a moment when he lifted her clean\noff her feet so effortlessly, it felt as if she might never come down…\nBut in the end, what truly makes a man is above the neck. The instant\nshe made a joke, Orso would have pounced upon it, unfolded and\ndeveloped it, tossed it back delightfully changed. Leo scarcely realised a\njoke had been made. Like that new invention Curnsbick was always\nprattling about, he was a wagon on rails. Conversationally he went only one\nway, and that at no great speed.\nShe needed a little something. She bent as if to adjust her shoe and\nslipped the silver box from her sleeve. Just a pinch to settle the nerves. That\nfirst pinch, which was actually about the fifth that morning, did not quite do\nthe trick, so she took a bigger one.

A lady of taste never leaves a job half-\ndone, after all.\nShe straightened up sharply and nearly toppled right over, the rush of\nblood to her head so savage she thought her eyes might pop from her skull.\nWhen things came back into focus, she realised Zuri was holding her firmly\nby the elbow.\n“What?” snarled Savine, ripping her arm free. She felt guilty right away.\n“Sorry. I’m sorry. I’d be lost without you.”\n“Lady Savine…” Zuri glanced carefully about the royal box. Her\nstumble had evidently been noticed. They were always watching, the\nfucking vultures, hoping for fresh meat to rip at. “You do not seem\nyourself.”\n“Who am I now, exactly? Answer me that.” She was close to shrieking\nall of a sudden, the pulse throbbing behind her temples, and she wiped her\nsore nose, and closed her eyes. “I’m sorry, Zuri. No one deserves being\nshouted at less than you.”\n“Do you need to leave?”\n“And miss all this shit?” As she waved towards the thronging square,\nSavine noticed the finger and thumbtip of her glove were stained white with\npearl dust and tried unsuccessfully to slap it off against her other hand.\n“Sticky fingers?” murmured her father from the side of his mouth.\nAlthough, of course, he was not her father. Arch Lector Glokta, entirely\nunrelated by blood.\n“Nothing you need to concern yourself with,” she snapped.\n“But I am concerned.” He continued to gaze out at the crowd as the\ndistant cheering grew louder, the happy parade approaching through the\nstreets of the Agriont, but he crooked one finger to beckon her down beside\nhis chair. “Might I ask what you are doing with Brock?”\n“You know about that?”\n“I imagine half of Adua knows about it.”\n“The last thing I need is a fucking lecture,” she snarled, and suddenly,\nentirely unbidden, entirely inappropriate, a memory welled up. That dark-\nskinned little girl, wet eyes lit by flames, pleading with her in a filthy alley\nin Valbeck. Please, please, please, over and over, the crushing terror and the\nstink of burning.\nHer clothes were too tight, far too tight, she could hardly breathe. She\ntwisted and wriggled in a sweaty panic, fumbled pointlessly behind her\nwaist at laces she knew she could not loosen. No more than a prisoner could\npick their shackles off with their fingernails.\nHer father frowned up at her. “Whatever has got into you, Savine?”\n“Into me?” Fury bubbling up again as she caught the arm of his chair\nand bent to hiss in his ear. “Do you know what your wife told me?”\n“Of course I know. What kind of a fool do you take me for?”\nShe gave a snort of bitter, snotty laughter. “Not half as big a one as you\nand my mother took me for.”\nA flurry of twitches ran up the left side of his face and set his eyelid\nflickering. “Your mother was young, and alone, and she made a mistake.\nSince then, all she has thought of is what was best for you.”"

He forced\nthe words through tight lips. “Put aside your pique, this is serious.”\n“Pique?” she whispered. “Pique? I’m a lie, do you not understand?”\nSeveral people had evidently caught the anger of their exchange, curious\nfaces turned towards them. One in particular. The First of the Magi stood\nbeside the king, dressed in robes with a dash of the arcane now, for a public\nappearance. He smiled, a knowing little smile, and gave her a nod of\nacknowledgement.\nHer father did not miss it. He scarcely moved his thin lips, but she could\nsee a muscle working on the side of his head. “Has he approached you?”\n“Who?”\n“Bayaz,” he hissed, gripping her wrist almost painfully tight.\n“I’ve never spoken to him.” Savine frowned. “Though… there was a\nman, at the Solar Society, who claimed to be a magus. He didn’t look like\none.”\nThe cords in her father’s thin neck shifted as he swallowed. “Sulfur?”\n“He said some nonsense about changing the world. About seeking new\nfriends—”\n“Whatever they ask for, whatever they offer, refuse, do you\nunderstand?” He looked up at her now. She was not sure she had ever seen\nhim look scared before. “Refuse and come to me at once.”\n“What the hell has Bayaz to do with anything—”\n“Everything!” He gripped her even tighter, pulled her even closer. “I\nhardly think you have considered the danger of your position. Bastard or\nno, you are the king’s oldest child. That could make you very valuable. And\nvery vulnerable. Now pull yourself together. This sulking is beneath you.”\nHe let go of her, wiped a tear from his weeping left eye and began politely\nto applaud as Leo dan Brock rode into the square, smiling hugely, and the\ncheering was redoubled.\nSavine slowly straightened, rubbing at the livid marks her father’s\nfingers had left on her wrist. She wanted to punch him in his toothless\nmouth. She wanted to scream at the mad top of her voice, right in the king’s\nface. She wanted at least to storm furiously away.\nBut that would only draw attention. And no one could know. Her father\nwas right about that. Or he would have been, if he had been her father.\nBayaz was still smiling straight at her. Less majestic than the statue which\nstood not far off on the Kingsway, but a great deal more smug. All Savine\ncould do was turn her attention to the square, push her shoulders back, her\nchin up and her face into the blandest smile imaginable, and clap.\nAnd fume like a boiling kettle.\nOrso heard the cheering ahead as the parade reached the Square of\nMarshals. He heard the chanting of, “Leo! Leo!” The calls of, “The Young\nLion!” There could be no doubt the manly bastard filled the role of hero\nspectacularly well.

        "text": "Lion!” There could be no doubt the manly bastard filled the role of hero\nspectacularly well. Far better than Orso ever could.\nHe had to admit to being pleasantly surprised by the new Lord Governor\nof Angland. He had expected him to be a humourless thug and, yes, he had\nthe usual provincial prejudices, but he turned out to be rather winningly\nhonest and generous. A hard man to hate. The poor bastard had no idea he\nwas hammering nails into Orso’s skull when he talked about Savine. He had\nno idea about a lot of things. Probably she would squeeze the hapless fool\nuntil his pips squeaked and leave him a pining husk. It would hardly be the\nfirst time she’d done it. All it took was the thought of her with another man\nto leave Orso wanting to puke out his eyes.\nThen he caught sight of Rikke, and found he was smiling in spite of\nhimself.\nShe slouched in the saddle, squinting angrily up at the sun as though she\nwas taking its shining personally. He wasn’t sure she’d changed a thing\nsince getting out of his bed. Among that immaculately tailored, groomed\nand decorated company, he found her total lack of effort oddly attractive.\nHe had wanted to marry the best-dressed woman in the Circle of the\nWorld, after all, and look how that turned out.\n“Your Highness,” she grunted as he dropped back towards her.\n“Your…” Orso frowned. “What’s the term of address for an emissary\nfrom the Protectorate?”\n“Rikke?”\n“You don’t stand on ceremony up there, do you?”\n“We stomp all over it. What are you doing back here with the chaff? Not\nenough width on one street for two heads so swollen as yours and Leo dan\nBrock’s?”\n“I quite like him.” Orso shrugged. “A great deal better than I like\nmyself, at least. In which I think, for once, I am in tune with the public\nmood.” Those commoners who looked in Orso’s direction did so, in the\nmain, with hatred. “No doubt I deserve it, though.”\n“Unpopular at home, you came down here to work on overseas\nalliances. You’re not the self-obsessed rake I was expecting.”\n“I fear I’m even worse.” He leaned towards her, dropping his voice.\n“There’s only one alliance I want to work on, and it’s the one between my\nprick and your—”\nHe caught sight of the man riding just behind Rikke. A towering old\nNorthman with the most monstrous scar he had ever seen, a bright ball of\nmetal gleaming in the midst of it. His other eye was fixed on Orso with an\nexpression fit to freeze the blood. Though it must be hard to find warm\nexpressions when you have a face like a murderer’s nightmare.\nOrso swallowed. “Your friend has a metal eye.”\n“That’s Caul Shivers. Got a good claim to being the most feared man in\nthe North.”\n“And he’s… your bodyguard?”\nRikke shrugged her bony shoulders. “Just a friend. But I guess he’s\nfilling the role.”\n“And the woman?”\nShe watched Orso even more intently than Shivers, if anything, one"

But I guess he’s\nfilling the role.”\n“And the woman?”\nShe watched Orso even more intently than Shivers, if anything, one\nhand blue with tattoos, her stony-hard face shifting rhythmically as she\nchewed at something. Without breaking eye contact, she turned her head\nand savagely spat.\n“That’s Isern-i-Phail. Reckoned most wise among the hillwomen. She\nknows all the ways. Even better’n her daddy did. She’s been helping me\nopen the Long Eye. And to make of my heart a stone. With mixed results.”\n“So she’s… your tutor?”\nRikke shrugged again. “Just a friend. But I guess she’s filling the role.”\n“For an easy-going woman, you have some fearsome retainers.”\n“Don’t worry. You’re safe.” She leaned close. “Long as you don’t let me\ndown.”\n“Oh, I let everyone down.” He grinned at her, and she grinned back, all\nthe way across her wide mouth. It looked so wonderfully open and true,\nsomehow, that he felt pleased with himself for having some part in it. He\nhad proposed to the most manipulative woman in the Circle of the World,\nafter all.\nLook how that turned out.\nNo expense had been spared. They’d turned the Square of Marshals into an\narena, like they did for the Summer Contest, banks of seating bursting with\nhappy crowds. The buildings were decked with flags: the sun of the Union,\nthe crossed hammers of Angland. Everyone wore their best, though their\nbest varied depending on which end of the square you were at. Up at the\nother end it was jewels and silk, down here it was twice-turned jackets and\na ribbon or two for the lucky ones.\nStill, feeling is free, so there was no shortage of emotion as the glittering\nranks tramped past. There was jealous admiration: of beggars for\ncommoners, of commoners for gentry, of gentry for nobility, of nobility for\nroyalty, all twisting their necks looking always up to what they didn’t quite\nhave. There was warlike enthusiasm, mostly from those who’d never drawn\na sword in their lives, since those used to swinging them tend to know\nbetter. There was patriotic fervour enough to drown an island full of foreign\nscum, and righteous delight that the Union made the best young bastards in\nthe world. There was civic pride from the denizens of mighty Adua, City of\nWhite Towers, for no one breathed vapours so thick or drank water as dirty\nas they did, nor paid so much for rooms so small.\nWhen it came to feeding the people, or housing them better than dogs,\nthere were always harsh limits on what government could afford. But for a\nroyal triumph, the Closed Council would find a way. Someone who’d\nstarved in the camps, who’d lied her way into the hearts and beds of good\npeople, who’d tricked and tortured to betray a cause she halfway believed in\nfor the sake of one she didn’t at all, might’ve felt a little bitter at seeing all\nthis money wasted.\nBut Vick had a harder heart than that, and for damn sure a harder head.\nOr so she told herself.\n“Been looking all over for you.” Tallow was at her elbow.

No need for\nhim to shove through the crowds. He was that thin, he could just slip\nthrough the gaps like a breeze under a door. He’d brought a girl, wearing a\nbest bonnet that even Vick, who’d never worn a bonnet in her life, could tell\nhad been out of fashion a century ago. “This is my sister.”\nVick blinked. “The one who—”\n“I’ve only got the one.”\nThere was no telling how old she was. When children don’t get fed\nproperly, sometimes they look far younger than they are, sometimes far\nolder. Sometimes both at once. She had her brother’s big eyes but a face\neven thinner, so hers looked even bigger, like a tragic frog’s. Vick could see\nher own stern, distorted reflection in the damp corners of them, and didn’t\nmuch like the look of it, either.\n“Go on, then,” said Tallow, nudging his sister with his elbow.\nThe girl swallowed, as if she was dragging up the words from a long\nway down. “Just wanted… to thank you. It’s a good place, I been living.\nClean. And they feed me. Much as I can eat. Though I don’t eat much, I\nguess. Just… our parents died, you know. We never had anyone looking out\nfor us before.”\nVick was hard. Ask anyone who’d tried to cross her in the camps. Ask\nanyone she’d sent to the camps since. Ask anyone unlucky enough to run\nacross her. Vick was hard. But that stung. The girl was thanking her for\nbeing a hostage. Thanking her for using her as a tool to make her brother\nbetray his friends.\n“What did Tallow tell you?” muttered Vick.\n“Nothing really!” Worried she’d get him into trouble. “Just that he was\ndoing some work for you, and so you were looking after me while he was\ndoing it.” She glanced up, fearful. “Is the work done?”\n“The work’s never done,” said Vick, and the girl perked up right away.\nMaybe she should’ve been happy that someone was happy about more\nwork. But Vick had never been sure what being happy felt like. Maybe it\nhad happened and she hadn’t noticed.\nThere was an ear-splitting fanfare, hundreds of boot heels crashing down\ntogether as the soldiers found their final places and brought the parade to an\nend. For a moment, all was still. Then someone rose from among the great\nmen of the Closed Council, from beside the king, sunlight gleaming on the\narcane symbols stitched into his shimmering robes. Bayaz, the First of the\nMagi.\n“My noble lords and ladies! My stout yeomen and women! My proud\ncitizens of the Union! We stand at the site of a great victory!” And he\nsmiled out at the Square of Marshals. A place that was still being\npainstakingly rebuilt after he’d levelled it no more than thirty years ago.\nThey said it would be better than ever when they were done. But things are\nalways going to be better, or were better long ago. No politician ever got\nanywhere by telling people things are just right as they are."

No politician ever got\nanywhere by telling people things are just right as they are.\n“Here the best the Gurkish could send against us were utterly crushed!”\nAnd Bayaz shook one meaty fist, calling up a patriotic grumble as a\nconductor calls up the percussion. “Here their great emperor was utterly\nlaid low. Here the Prophet Khalul was utterly humbled, his cursed army of\nEaters sent back to hell where they belonged. We were told the emperor’s\nsoldiers were countless, the Prophet’s children indestructible. But the Union\nwas victorious! I was victorious. The forces of superstition and savagery\nwere defeated, and the gates opened to a new age of progress and\nprosperity.” Bayaz’s smile was huge enough to be seen all the way across\nthe arena. Clearly a magus could be as pleased with his own past glories as\nany other old man.\n“To me—for it needs hardly to be said that I am very old—it still feels\nlike yesterday. But the bright-eyed young heroes who fought the Gurkish\nhere are old greybeards now.” And he set a heavy hand down on the\nshoulder of King Jezal, who looked more queasy than pleased by the\nrecognition. “The pages of history turn, one generation gives way to\nanother, and today we have not one, but two new famous Union victories to\ncelebrate! In the North, on the barren borders of Angland, Lord Governor\nBrock defeated enemies without!” There was widespread cheering, and a\nchild on someone’s shoulders frantically waved a little Union flag. “While\nhere in Midderland, outside the walls of Valbeck, Crown Prince Orso put\npaid to rebellion within!”\nOrso’s applause was quieter, especially at this end of the square, and\nwhat there was had the overblown quality of coming from purse rather than\nheart. The prince had few friends among the nobility, even fewer among the\ncommon folk. From what Vick could see of his expression, he knew it, too.\n“I feel bad for Orso.” Tallow gave a maudlin little sigh. He’d a talent for\nmaudlin, that boy. “Wasn’t his fault those folk got hanged.”\n“Guess not,” said Vick. Less his fault than hers, anyway. “Fancy a\npauper having pity to spare for a crown prince.”\n“Pity costs nothing, does it?”\n“You might be surprised.”\n“I have seen many battles fought!” Bayaz called as the last of the\ncheering faded. “Many battles won. But I have never been prouder of the\nvictors. Never held higher hopes for their futures. We of older generations\nwill do what we can. To advise. To inform. To give the benefit of our hard-\nwon experience. But the future belongs to the young. With young people\nsuch as these…” He spread his arms wide, one towards the man they called\nthe Young Lion, the other towards the one they were starting to call the\nYoung Lamb. “I feel the future could not be in safer hands.”\nMore applause, and more cheering, but there was grumbling, too, among\nthe poor around Vick.

Trouble all over. Vick frowned\nat Prince Orso, then at that Northern girl with the hair like a bird’s nest\nblown from its tree. She was staring at her own hand with the oddest\nexpression. From what Vick could tell, it was shaking. She scrambled\ndrunkenly from her horse and took something on a thong around her neck\nand wedged it in her mouth.\n“What’s got into her?” asked Tallow.\n“Couldn’t say.”\nLike a tree chopped down, she toppled over backwards.\n“Rikke?”\nShe prised open one eye. A slit of sickening, stabbing brightness.\n“Are you all right?” Orso was cradling her head with one hand and\nlooking quite concerned.\nShe pushed the spit-wet dowel out of her mouth with her tongue and\ncroaked the one word she could think of. “Fuck.”\n“There’s my girl!” Isern squatted on her other side, necklace of runes\nand finger bones dangling, grinning that twisted grin that showed the hole in\nher teeth and offering no help at all. “What did you see?”\nRikke heaved one hand up to grip her head. Felt like if she didn’t hold\nher skull together it’d burst. Shapes still fizzed on the insides of her lids,\nlike the glowing smears when you’ve looked at a candle in a black room.\n“I saw a white horse prancing at the top of a broken tower.” Choking\nsmoke, the stink of burning. “I saw a great door open but on the other side\nthere was only an empty room.” Empty shelves, nothing but dust. “I saw…”\nShe felt a fear creeping up on her then. “I saw an old chieftain dead.” She\npressed her hand to her left eye. Felt hot still. Burning hot.\n“Who was it?”\n“An old chieftain, dead, in a high hall lit with candles. Men gathered\nabout the body, looking down. All of ’em wondering what they could get\nfrom it. Like they were dogs, and that dead old man was the meat.” That\nfear grew worse and worse and Rikke’s eyes got wider and wider. “I have to\ngo home.”\n“You think it was your da?” asked Isern.\n“Who else could it be?”\nShivers was frowning hard, sun gleaming on his metal eye. “If it is…\nthere’s no telling who’ll seize power in Uffrith.”\nRikke winced at the thumping in her head. “All shadows where their\nfaces should’ve been. But I saw what I saw!”\n“You’re sure?” asked Orso.\n“I’m sure.” Rikke groaned as she pushed herself up onto one elbow.\n“I’ve got to go back to the North. And the sooner the…” She realised\neveryone was looking at her. And everyone was a hell of a lot of people\nright then.

Clover would’ve thought a man who drank as much as he\ndid would’ve got better at it, but the bastard couldn’t seem to stop spilling.\n“The Young Lion could’ve killed you.”\n“Aye.” Stour frowned at the floor, still a trace of yellow bruises around\nhis eyes. “I’d have killed him, if things had gone the other way.”\n“Daresay you would’ve.” And Scale chuckled and beckoned for more\nale. His old bastards had something smug about them now, and Stour’s\nyoung ones something grudging. When their master lost, they’d all lost a\nlittle themselves. A little pride, anyway. It’d been a long time since Clover\nhad seen pride as aught but a handicap, yet some men still loved it more\nthan gold.\n“The king seems oddly pleased about his champion’s defeat,” muttered\nWonderful, almost without moving her lips.\n“Aye,” said Clover. “Maybe ’cause it gives him a chance to wag his\nfinger and harp on the hubris of youth and go over all he’s learned in a long\ncareer of draining ale cups.”\n“Even though he was every bit as keen on a duel as Stour.”\n“That’s kings for you. The shit ideas are always someone else’s.” Clover\nwatched Stour rubbing at his hurt leg. Seemed more tame puppy than Great\nWolf now. Thoughtful. Subdued, even. “Looks like defeat might’ve finally\ntaught our king-in-waiting some lessons, mind you.”\n“Like it did you?”\n“Failure’s the best schoolmaster, they say.”\nWonderful nodded, looking out at the room from under her grey-flecked\nbrows. “So the war’s over.”\n“Seems so,” said Clover. “A lot of men dead, and nothing much\nchanged.”\n“That’s war for you. Turns out best for the worst of us. No doubt we’ll\nhave another presently.”\n“I shouldn’t wonder.”\n“And in the meantime?

You?”\nWonderful frowned over at Stour and let a breath sigh through her nose.\n“Long as I’m done babysitting this bastard, I really don’t care.”\n“You could come join me.”\n“And teach boys sword-work?”\n“You’ve more wisdom to pass on than most, I reckon.”\nShe snorted. “More than you have, that’s for sure.”\n“There you go. Like all good partnerships, we make up for each other’s\ndeficiencies. You can do the passing of the wisdom, I’ll do the sitting in the\nshade.” And Clover took a sup from his own cup and grinned, thinking\nabout being propped up against his favourite tree. The rough bark against\nhis back. The sticks going clack clack down in the field.\n“You’re serious,” she said, eyes narrowed."

If I’ve ended up doing things alone, it’s\nmore through bad luck than preference.”\n“That and through killing your friends, anyway.”\n“This is the North,” muttered Clover. “Who hasn’t killed a friend or\ntwo?” And they grinned at one another, and tapped their cups together.\nA few chairs down, Stour was frowning into his ale as if there was a\nriddle at the bottom. “I never lost before. Not at anything.”\n“Would’ve won if it wasn’t for that fucking witch!” sneered Greenway,\nas bitter as if it was him who’d lost. “Fucking Long Eye, or whatever.\nFucking cheating, that’s what that was. They should all have the bloody\ncross cut in ’em.”\n“There’s no rule against shouting out, is there?” Stour spoke soft, and\nwith a musing sort of look Clover never saw him wear before. “And I\nreckon she did me a favour. Losing… it’s made me see things a new way.\nLike putting a coloured glass to your eye and seeing the world in new\ncolours, or… no! Like taking one away, and seeing the world as it is!”\nScale raised his brows at his nephew. He wasn’t the only one doing it.\nClover scarcely had room on his forehead for how high his had gone.\n“Might be you’re more like your father than I thought,” said the king. “I\nknew you were a fighter, but I never had you marked down for a thinker.”\n“Nor did I,” said Stour, his wet eyes bright. “But when you’re laid up\nwounded, what can you do but think? Made me realise. The Young Lion\ndidn’t put me in the mud. But we’re all heading there sooner or later.”\n“True, Nephew, the Great Leveller waits for us all.”\n“Made me realise.” And Stour stared at his hand as he curled the fingers\ninto a fist. “You only have a lifetime to make your name and a lifetime\nmight not be that long.”\n“True, Nephew. No one’ll hand you a place in the songs. You have to\nseize it.”\n“Made me realise.” And Stour thumped the table. “You can’t wait to\ntake what’s yours.”\nScale smiled as he lifted his cup. “True, Ne—”\nThe word was cut off in a kind of sickly squelch, and the king puked\nblood and ale and Clover saw to his great surprise that Stour had buried a\nknife in his uncle’s neck.\nThere was a click and something spattered Clover’s face, and he saw the\nold warrior beside him just got his head split down to the bridge of his nose\nwith an axe.\nAnother was shoved onto the table and had his head hacked off right\nthere.

He swore and\ndrooled blood into his beard then a mace stove in the back of his head.\nOne of the king’s serving girls had been knocked on the ground, the\nother was clutching her jug to her chest like she could hide behind it. Scale\nhimself had flopped face down on the table, eyes popping and his tongue\nhanging out, still weakly blowing red bubbles out of his nose while bloody\nale dripped from the edge of the table with a tap, tap, tap.\nOne of his old warriors was underneath it, crawling, snarling, crawling,\ntrying to reach a fallen sword with his one good arm. He stretched, and\nstretched, like working his fingers across that little space of stone to the\npommel was all that mattered. One of Stour’s boys hopped over the table\nand stomped down on the back of his neck once, twice, three times with a\ncrunching of bone.\nDidn’t take more than a few breaths for the old cunts to be sent back to\nthe mud, the young to stand over ’em with smiles on their red-speckled\nfaces.\nClover cleared his throat, and carefully set down his cup, and pushed\nback his chair and stood. Realised he still had a half-eaten meat bone in his\nhand and tossed it on the table, rubbing the grease from his fingers.\nHe felt strange. Calm. The axe made a sucking sound as it was dragged\nout of that old warrior’s head. Stour’s men turned towards him, red blades\nin their hands. Wonderful faced ’em, on her feet in a fighting crouch, sword\nlevelled and teeth bared.\n“Easy, everyone!” called Stour. “Everyone easy!” And he sat back, the\nwolf smile across his bruised face wider than ever. “See this coming,\nClover?”\n“We don’t all have the Long Eye.” For all his high opinions of his own\ncleverness, he’d been as blind to it as Scale. But he knew if Stour wanted\nhim dead, he’d have been stretched out with the others. So Clover stood\nthere, and waited to see which way the wind would blow.\n“You make out you’re a silly bastard.” Stour took a little sip from his\ncup and licked his lips. “But you’re a clever bastard, too. The wise fool, eh?\nAlways thought your lessons were coward’s nonsense but, looking back, I\nsee you had the right of it all along.” He wagged his bloody dagger at\nClover. “Like what you said about knives and swords. Spent twenty years\ntraining with a sword every morning and every dusk, but I won more with\none knife-thrust. I’d like you to stick with me. Might be you’ve more to\nteach. But… I’ll need a show o’ good faith.” He looked sideways, to\nWonderful. “Kill her.”\nShe turned, eyes wide. “Clo—”\nShe looked greatly surprised as he caught her in a hug, her sword arm\ntrapped under his left while he stabbed her in the heart with his right, and\nthe blood gushed hot over his fist and down his arm and spattered the floor."

He’d always said so. Told everyone\nwho’d listen. Have to recognise it when it comes, and seize it, with no care\nfor the past and no worries about the future.\nHe held her as she died. Didn’t take long. He told himself he’d want to\nbe held when he went back to the mud, but it was really that he wanted to\nhold her. Needed to. What she felt about it, there was no knowing. The\nfeelings of the dead weigh less than a feather.\nNo last words. Just a sort of grunt. And Clover lowered her to the\nground and laid her in the widening pool of her own blood, her\ndisappointed eyes fixed on some cobwebs high among the rafters.\n“Fuck,” said Stour. “You didn’t have to think about that for long.”\n“No.” Clover had seen a lot of corpses. Made a fair few himself. But he\nwas having trouble thinking of Wonderful as dead. Any moment, she’d\nlaugh it off. Make some joke about it. Cut him down to size with a raised\nbrow.\n“That was cold.” Greenway shook his head while another of the young\nwarriors gave a long whistle. “Cold.”\n“A man has to bend with the breeze.” The Great Wolf’s grin was wider\nthan ever. “You’re a bastard, Clover. But you’re my kind of bastard.”\nStour’s kind of bastard. That was where all his cleverness had got him.\nThere was a bang as the doors were flung open, armed men spilling into\nthe hall, painted shields up and swords and spears and axes ready. Black\nCalder strode in after them, eyes wide as he took in all the murder.\n“Father!” called Stour, pouring some ale and holding up the cup. “Fancy\na drink?” And he drained it, and set it down in the spreading puddle of the\nking’s blood.\n“What have you done?” whispered Calder.\n“Chosen not to wait.” Stour peeled Scale’s fat head from the table by\none ear and dragged the chain from around his shoulders, its dangling\ndiamond red with blood. Greenway giggled and the others grinned, all well\nsatisfied with the outcome.\nClover had never thought to see Black Calder at a loss for words. He\nlooked to Wonderful’s body, then to Clover, then back to his son, and\nbunched his fists. “We’ve got allies who won’t stand for this! There’ll be\nmen who won’t stay loyal!”\n“Didn’t you hear?” asked Stour. “I made a friend of the Young Lion!\nWon’t find a stronger ally than the Union. But if folk want to stick with my\nuncle, that’s fine.” And he showed his teeth, wet eyes bulging. “They can go\nback to the fucking mud with him!” And Stour tossed the chain over his\nown shoulders, the red links landing skewed and smearing blood across his\nwhite shirt. “They’re going to have to learn times change.

Always had been.\nAnd with all those old warriors lying slaughtered on the bloody floor of the\nhall, it seemed the future had come early. A man’s worst enemies are his\nown ambitions, Bethod used to say, and here was the red-spattered proof.\nBlack Calder had ruled for twenty years. With one thrust of the knife, his\ntime was done.\n“Your grandfather’s dream—” he whispered, like all his grand schemes\ncould be unfucked. Like King Scale could be unkilled.\nStour gave a hiss, somewhere between disgust and boredom. “Folk say a\nlot o’ things about my grandfather, Bethod this and Bethod that, but I never\neven met the bastard.” He winced as he lifted his wounded leg and propped\nit up on the murdered king’s fat back. “I got my own dreams to think\nabout.”\nClover just stood there, the blood soaking his sleeve turning cold.\nLong Live the King\nO\nrso woke in the darkness and reached out, but she was gone.\nHe sat up, not sure where he was. Not sure who he had been reaching\nfor. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose. Had he been dreaming?\nRikke had gone back to the North. Savine had gone for good. People\nstill clambered over each other to be noticed by him, of course, to embrace\nhim, to flatter him, to profit by him. But he was alone.\nHe could not remember ever feeling more so.\nHe was snatched from the comforting blanket of self-pity by a noise in\nthe hall. A distant shout, muffled. Then another, closer, and the thumping of\nquick footsteps, past and away. He flung back the covers, swinging his bare\nfeet to the cold floor. Shadows moved in a thin strip of light under his door,\nthen the knob turned and it creaked open.\n“Bloody hell, Mother, don’t you ever knock?”\nShe looked regal as ever, face emotionless as a mask by the light of the\ncandle she held. But she wore a dressing gown and her hair was down. Orso\nwas not sure he had ever seen her leave her chambers without it elaborately\npinned. It hung almost to her waist and seemed, somehow, a surer herald of\ndisaster than if some other person had charged in on fire.\n“What is it?” he whispered.\n“Come with me, Orso.”\nThere was a great deal of activity in the palace, considering it was the\nmiddle of the night. Everyone busy at nothing, running to nowhere, all with\nthe same oddly panicked expression. A fully armoured Knight of the Body\nclanked past, sweat beaded across his forehead, the lamp in his hand\nbringing a glitter to the gilded panelling.\n“What is it, Mother?” asked Orso, his mouth very dry.\nShe said nothing, only glided down the chilly hallway, decorated with\nberries for the new year festival, so quickly he had to take the odd running\nstep to keep up.\nThree more Knights of the Body stood at the towering door of his\nfather’s bedchamber.

One gave Orso the strangest haunted look before he turned his\neyes to the shining tiles.\nThere was a press of people about the bed, in nightshirts and dressing\ngowns, grey hair in wispy disarray. Men of the king’s household, lords of\nthe Closed Council, shocked faces strange in the shifting candlelight. They\nparted wordlessly to let him through and Orso was drawn into the gap\nwithout choosing to move his feet. As if he was rolled along on a trolley,\nnumb and dreamlike, his breath coming slow, slow, slow, until it hardly\nseemed to come at all.\nHe stopped beside the bed, looking down.\nKing Jezal the First lay flat on his back, eyes closed, mouth slightly\nopen. The covers had been pulled down to his ankles, feet still making two\nlittle peaks in the crimson cloth. His nightshirt had been dragged right up\nabove his chest, waxy pale body exposed, fuzzed here and there with grey\nhair, shrivelled prick flopped sideways and stuck flat to his hip. Orso’s\nfather had always said that dignity was a luxury kings could not afford.\nThe royal physician knelt by the bed, ear pressed to the king’s chest.\nSomeone pushed through the crowd to offer him a hand mirror and he held\nit to the king’s mouth, fumbled for his eye-lenses and perched them on his\nnose.\n“There was no sign he was ill,” came a disbelieving mutter.\n“I was talking to His Majesty just last night. He was in high spirits!”\n“What the hell does that matter?” someone snarled.\nThe silence stretched.\nThe physician carefully put down the mirror and slowly stood.\n“Well?” asked Lord Chamberlain Hoff, wringing his pale hands.\nThe physician blinked, then shook his head.\nBremer dan Gorst took a breath so sharp it made a strange squeak in his\nbroad nose.\nArch Lector Glokta slumped into his wheeled chair. “The king is dead,”\nhe murmured.\nA kind of groan went through the gathering. Or maybe it came from\nOrso’s own throat.\nSuddenly he felt that there had been so much he needed to say to his\nfather. He had always supposed they would discuss the important things\nlater. The profound things. But it would never happen. There had only been\na fixed time in his presence, and Orso had pissed it all away talking about\nthe weather, and there would be no more.\nHe felt a heavy hand on his shoulder, more grasping than comforting,\nand turned to see the First of the Magi standing beside him. He almost had\nthe ghost of a smile at the corner of his mouth.\n“Long live the king,” said Bayaz.\nAcknowledgments\nAs always, four people without whom:\nBren Abercrombie, whose eyes are sore from reading it.\nNick Abercrombie, whose ears are sore from hearing about it.\nRob Abercrombie, whose fingers are sore from turning the pages.\nLou Abercrombie, whose arms are sore from holding me up.\nThen, my heartfelt thanks:\nTo all the lovely and talented people in British publishing who have helped"
