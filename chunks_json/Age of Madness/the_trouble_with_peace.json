There was a metaphor there somewhere. The\nburden of power, the weight of a crown. But his Closed Council had no\ndoubt heard all that before.\nThe moment he sat they began to drag out their own chairs, wincing as\nold backs bent, grunting as old arses settled on hard wood, grumbling as old\nknees were eased under the tottering heaps of paper on the table.\n“Where’s the surveyor general?” someone asked, nodding at an empty\nchair.\n“Out with his bladder.” There was a chorus of groans.\n“One can win a thousand battles.” Lord Marshal Brint worried at that\nlady’s ring on his little finger, gazing into the middle distance as though at\nan opposing army. “But in the end, no man can defeat his own bladder.”\nAs the youngest in the room by some thirty years, Orso ranked his\nbladder among his least interesting organs. “One issue before we begin,” he\nsaid.\nAll eyes turned towards him. Apart from those of Bayaz, down at the\nfoot of the table. The legendary wizard continued to gaze out of the\nwindow, towards the palace gardens which were just beginning to bud.\n“I am set on making a grand tour of the Union.” Orso did his best to\nsound authoritative. Regal, even. “To visit every province. Every major city.\nWhen was the last time a monarch visited Starikland? Did my father ever\ngo?”\nArch Lector Glokta grimaced. Even more than usual. “Starikland was\nnot considered safe, Your Majesty.”\n“Starikland has always been afflicted with a restless temper.” Lord\nChancellor Gorodets was absently smoothing his long beard into a point,\nfluffing it up, then smoothing it again. “Now more than ever.”\n“But I have to connect with the people.” Orso thumped the table to give\nit emphasis. They needed some feeling in here. Everything in the White\nChamber was cold, dry, bloodless calculation. “Show them we’re all part of\nthe same great endeavour. The same family. It’s supposed to be a Union,\nisn’t it? We need to bloody unite.”\nOrso had never wanted to be king. He enjoyed it even less than being"

        "text": "the same great endeavour. The same family. It’s supposed to be a Union,\nisn’t it? We need to bloody unite.”\nOrso had never wanted to be king. He enjoyed it even less than being\ncrown prince, if that was possible. But now that he was king, he was\ndetermined to do some good with it.\nLord Chamberlain Hoff tapped at the table in limp applause. “A\nwonderful idea, Your Majesty.”\n“Wonderful,” echoed High Justice Bruckel, who had the conversational\nstyle of a woodpecker and a beak not dissimilar. “Idea.”\n“Noble sentiments, well expressed,” agreed Gorodets, though his\nappreciation did not quite reach his eyes.\nOne old man fussed with some papers. Another frowned into his wine as\nthough something had died in it. Gorodets was still stroking his beard, but\nnow looked as if he could taste piss.\n“But?” Orso was learning that in the Closed Council there was always at\nleast one but.\n“But…” Hoff glanced to Bayaz, who gave permission with the slightest\nnod. “It might be best to wait for a more auspicious moment. A more settled\ntime. There are so many challenges here which require Your Majesty’s\nattention.”\nThe high justice puffed out a heavy breath. “Many. Challenges.”\nOrso delivered something between a growl and a sigh. His father had\nalways despised the White Chamber and its hard, stark chairs. Despised the\nhard, stark men who sat on them. He had warned Orso that no good was\never done in the Closed Council. But if not here, where? This cramped,\nstuffy, featureless little room was where the power lay. “Are you suggesting\nthe machinery of government would grind to a halt without me?” he asked.\n“I think you over-sugar the pudding.”\n“There are issues the monarch must be seen to attend to,” said Glokta.\n“The Breakers were dealt a crippling blow in Valbeck.”\n“A hard task well done, Your Majesty,” Hoff drooled out, with cloying\nsycophancy.\n“But they are far from eradicated. And those that escaped have\nbecome… even more extreme in their opinions.”\n“Disruption among the workers.” High Justice Bruckel rapidly shook his\nbony head. “Strikes. Organising. Attacks on staff and property.”\n“And the damn pamphlets,” said Brint, to a collective groan.\n“Damn. Pamphlets.”\n“Used to think education was merely wasted on the commoners. Now I\nsay it’s a positive danger.”\n“This bloody Weaver can turn a phrase.”\n“Not to mention an obscene etching.”\n“They incite the populace to disobedience!”\n“To disaffection!”\n“They talk of a Great Change coming.”\nA flurry of twitches ran up the left side of Glokta’s wasted face. “They\nblame the Open Council.” And published caricatures of them as pigs\nfighting over the trough. “They blame the Closed Council.” And published\ncaricatures of them fucking each other. “They blame His Majesty.” And\npublished caricatures of him fucking anything. “They blame the banks.”\n“They promote the ridiculous rumour that the debt… to the Banking\nHouse of Valint and Balk… has crippled the state…” Gorodets trailed off,\nleaving the room in nervous silence."

        "text": "“They promote the ridiculous rumour that the debt… to the Banking\nHouse of Valint and Balk… has crippled the state…” Gorodets trailed off,\nleaving the room in nervous silence.\nBayaz finally tore his hard, green eyes from the window to glare down\nthe table. “This flood of disinformation must be stemmed.”\n“We have destroyed a dozen presses,” grated Glokta, “but they build\nnew ones, and smaller all the time. Now any fool can write, and print, and\nair their opinions.”\n“Progress,” lamented Bruckel, rolling his eyes to the ceiling.\n“The Breakers are like bloody moles in a garden,” growled Lord\nMarshal Rucksted, who had turned his chair slightly sideways-on to give an\nimpression of fearless dash. “You kill five, pour a celebratory glass, then in\nthe morning your lawn’s covered in new bloody molehills.”\n“More irritating than my bladder,” said Brint, to widespread chuckling.\nGlokta sucked at his empty gums with a faint squelch. “And then there\nare the Burners.”\n“Lunatics!” snapped Hoff. “This woman Judge.”\nShudders of distaste about the table. At the notion of such a thing as a\nwoman, or at the notion of this particular one, it was hard to say.\n“I hear a mill owner was found murdered on the road to Keln.” Gorodets\ngave his beard a particularly violent tug. “A pamphlet nailed to his face.”\nRucksted clasped his big fists on the table. “And there was that fellow\nchoked to death with a thousand copies of the rule-sheet he distributed to\nhis employees…”\n“One might almost say our approach has made matters worse,” observed\nOrso. A memory of Malmer drifted up, legs dangling from his cage as it\nswung with the breeze. “Perhaps we could make some gesture. A minimum\nwage? Improved working conditions? I heard a recent fire in a mill led to\nthe deaths of fifteen child workers—”\n“It would be folly,” said Bayaz, his attention already back on the\ngardens, “to obstruct the free operation of the market.”\n“The market serves the interests of all,” offered the lord chancellor.\n“Unprecedented,” agreed the high justice. “Prosperity.”\n“No doubt the child workers would applaud it,” said Orso.\n“No doubt,” agreed Lord Hoff.\n“Had they not been burned to death.”\n“A ladder is of no use if all the rungs are at the top,” said Bayaz.\nOrso opened his mouth to retort but High Consul Matstringer got in first.\n“And we face a veritable cornucopia of adversaries overseas.” The\ncoordinator of the Union’s foreign policy had never yet failed to confuse\ncomplexity with insight. “The Gurkish may still be embroiled in all-\nencompassing predicaments of their own—”\nBayaz gave a rare grunt of satisfaction at that.\n“But the Imperials endlessly rattle their swords on our western border,\nexhorting the populace of Starikland to continued disloyalty, and the\nStyrians are emboldened in the east.”\n“They are building up their navy.” Lord Admiral Krepskin roused\nhimself for a heavy-lidded interjection. “New ships. Armed with cannon.\nWhile ours rot in their docks for lack of investment.”"

        "text": "“They are building up their navy.” Lord Admiral Krepskin roused\nhimself for a heavy-lidded interjection. “New ships. Armed with cannon.\nWhile ours rot in their docks for lack of investment.”\nBayaz gave a familiar grunt of dissatisfaction at that.\n“And they are busy in the shadows,” went on Matstringer, “sowing\ndiscord in Westport, enticing the Aldermen to sedition. Why, they have\nsucceeded in scheduling a vote within the month which could see the city\nsecede from the Union!”\nThe old men competed to display the most patriotic outrage. It was\nenough to make Orso want to secede from the Union himself.\n“Disloyalty,” grumbled the high justice. “Discord.”\n“Bloody Styrians!” snarled Rucksted. “Love to work in the shadows.”\n“We can work there, too,” said Glokta softly, in a manner that made the\nhairs prickle beneath Orso’s braid-heavy uniform. “Some of my very best\npeople are even now ensuring Westport’s loyalty.”\n“At least our northern border is secure,” said Orso, desperate to inject\nsome optimism.\n“Well…” The high consul crushed his hopes with a prim pursing of the\nmouth. “The politics of the North are always something of a cauldron. The\nDogman is advanced in years. Infirm. No man can divine the fate of his\nProtectorate in the event of his death. Lord Governor Brock would appear\nto have forged a strong bond with the new King of the Northmen, Stour\nNightfall—”\n“That has to be a good thing,” said Orso.\nDoubtful glances were traded across the table.\n“Unless their bond becomes… too strong,” murmured Glokta.\n“The young Lord Governor is popular,” agreed Gorodets.\n“Damned,” pecked the high justice. “Popular.”\n“Handsome lad,” said Brint. “And he’s earned a warrior’s reputation.”\n“Angland behind him. Stour as an ally. Could be a threat.”\nRucksted raised his bushy brows very high. “His grandfather, lest we\nforget, was an infamous bloody traitor!”\n“I will not see a man condemned for the actions of his grandfather!”\nsnapped Orso, whose own grandfathers had enjoyed mixed reputations, to\nsay the least. “Leo dan Brock risked his life fighting a duel on my behalf!”\n“The job of your Closed Council,” said Glokta, “is to anticipate threats\nto Your Majesty before they become threats.”\n“After may be too late,” threw in Bayaz.\n“People are… discomfited by the death of your father,” said Gorodets.\n“So young. So unexpected.”\n“Young. Unexpected.”\n“And you, Your Majesty, are—”\n“Despised?” offered Orso.\nGorodets gave an indulgent smile. “Untried. At times like this, people\nyearn for stability.”\n“Indeed. It would without doubt be a very fine thing if Your Majesty\nwere…” Lord Hoff cleared his throat. “To marry?”\nOrso closed his eyes and pressed finger and thumb against them. “Must\nwe?” Marriage was the last thing he wanted to discuss.

        "text": "we?” Marriage was the last thing he wanted to discuss. He still had Savine’s\nnote in a drawer beside his bed. Still looked at that brutal little line every\nevening, as one might pick at a scab. My answer must be no. I would ask\nyou not to contact me again. Ever.\nHoff cleared his throat once more. “A new king always finds himself in\nan uncertain position.”\n“A king with no heir, doubly so,” said Glokta.\n“The absence of clear succession gives a troubling impression of\nimpermanence,” observed Matstringer.\n“Perhaps with the help of Her Majesty your mother, I might draw up a\nlist of eligible ladies, both at home and abroad?” Hoff cleared his throat yet\na third time. “A new list… that is.”\n“By all means,” growled Orso, pronouncing each word with cutting\nprecision.\n“Then there is Fedor dan Wetterlant,” murmured the high justice.\nGlokta’s permanent grimace became even further contorted. “I hoped we\nmight settle that matter without bothering His Majesty.”\n“I’m bothered now,” snapped Orso. “Fedor dan Wetterlant… didn’t I\nplay cards with him once?”\n“He lived in Adua before inheriting the family estate. His reputation\nhere was…”\n“Almost as bad as mine?” Orso remembered the man. Soft face but hard\neyes. Smiled too much. Just like Lord Hoff, who was even now breaking\nout a particularly unctuous example.\n“I was going to say abominable, Your Majesty. He stands accused of\nserious crimes.”\n“He raped a laundry woman,” said Glokta, “with the assistance of his\ngroundskeeper. When her husband demanded justice, Wetterlant murdered\nthe man, again with the groundskeeper’s assistance. In a tavern. In full view\nof seventeen witnesses.” The emotionless quality of the Arch Lector’s\ngrating voice only served to sicken Orso even more. “Then he had a drink.\nThe groundskeeper poured, I believe.”\n“Bloody hell,” whispered Orso.\n“Those are the accusations,” said Matstringer.\n“Even Wetterlant scarcely disputes them,” said Glokta.\n“His mother does,” observed Gorodets.\nThere was a chorus of groans. “Lady Wetterlant, by the Fates, what a\nbattleaxe.”\n“Absolute. Harridan.”\n“Well, I’m no admirer of hangings,” said Orso, “but I’ve seen men\nhanged for far less.”\n“The groundskeeper already has been,” said Glokta.\n“Shame,” grunted Brint with heavy irony, “he sounded like a real\ncharmer.”\n“But Wetterlant has asked for the king’s justice,” said Bruckel.\n“His mother has demanded it!”\n“And since he has a seat on the Open Council—”\n“Not that his arse has ever touched it.”\n“—he has the right to be tried before his peers. With Your Majesty as the\njudge. We cannot refuse.”\n“But we can delay,” said Glokta. “The Open Council may not excel at\nmuch, but in delay it leads the world.”\n“Postpone. Defer. Adjourn. I can wrap him up. In form and procedure.\nUntil he dies in prison.” And the high justice smiled as though that was the"

        "text": "much, but in delay it leads the world.”\n“Postpone. Defer. Adjourn. I can wrap him up. In form and procedure.\nUntil he dies in prison.” And the high justice smiled as though that was the\nideal solution.\n“We just deny him a hearing?” Orso was almost as disgusted by that\noption as by the crime itself.\n“Of course not,” said Bruckel.\n“No, no,” said Gorodets. “We would not deny him anything.”\n“We’d simply never give him anything,” said Glokta.\nRucksted nodded. “I hardly think Fedor dan bloody Wetterlant or his\nbloody mother should be allowed to hold a dagger to the throat of the state\nsimply because he can’t control himself.”\n“He could at least lose control of himself in the absence of seventeen\nwitnesses,” observed Gorodets, and there was some light laughter.\n“So it’s not the rape or the murder we object to,” asked Orso, “but his\nbeing caught doing it?”\nHoff peered at the other councillors, as though wondering whether\nanyone might disagree. “Well…”\n“Why should I not just hear the case, and judge it on its merits, and\nsettle it one way or another?”\nGlokta’s grimace twisted still further. “Your Majesty cannot judge the\ncase without being seen to take sides.” The old men nodded, grunted,\nshifted unhappily in their uncomfortable chairs. “Find Wetterlant innocent,\nit will be nepotism, and favouritism, and will strengthen the hand of those\ntraitors like the Breakers who would turn the common folk against you.”\n“But find Wetterlant guilty…” Gorodets tugged unhappily at his beard\nand the old men grumbled more dismay. “The nobles would see it as an\naffront, as an attack, as a betrayal. It would embolden those who oppose\nyou in the Open Council at a time when we are trying to ensure a smooth\nsuccession.”\n“It seems sometimes,” snapped Orso, rubbing at those sore spots above\nhis temples, “that every decision I make in this chamber is between two\nequally bad outcomes, with the best option to make no decision at all!”\nHoff glanced about the table again. “Well…”\n“It is always a bad idea,” said the First of the Magi, “for a king to\nchoose sides.”\nEveryone nodded as though they had been treated to the most profound\nstatement of all time. It was a wonder they did not rise and give a standing\novation. Orso was left in no doubt at which end of the table the power in the\nWhite Chamber truly lay. He remembered the look on his father’s face as\nBayaz spoke. The fear. He made one more effort to claw his way towards\nhis best guess at the right thing.\n“Justice should be done. Shouldn’t it? Justice must be seen to be done.\nSurely! Otherwise… well… it’s not justice at all. Is it?”\nHigh Justice Bruckel bared his teeth as if in physical pain. “At this level.\nYour Majesty. Such concepts become… fluid. Justice cannot be stiff like\niron, but… more of a jelly. It must mould itself. About the greater\nconcerns.”\n“But… surely at this level, at the highest level, is where justice must be"

There must be a moral bedrock! It cannot all be…\nexpediency?”\nExasperated, Hoff looked towards the foot of the table. “Lord Bayaz,\nperhaps you might…”\nThe First of the Magi gave a weary sigh as he sat forward, hands\nclasped, regarding Orso from beneath heavy lids. The sigh of a veteran\nschoolmaster, called on once again to explain the basics to this year’s\nharvest of dunces.\n“Your Majesty, we are not here to set right all the world’s wrongs.”\nOrso stared back at him. “What are we here for, then?”\nBayaz neither smiled nor frowned. “To ensure that we benefit from\nthem.”\nA Long Way from Adua\nS\nuperior Lorsen lowered the letter, frowning at Vick over the rims of his\neye-lenses. He looked like a man who had not smiled in some time. Perhaps\never.\n“His Eminence the Arch Lector writes you a glowing report. He tells me\nyou were instrumental in ending the uprising at Valbeck. He feels I might\nneed your help.” Lorsen turned his frown on Tallow, standing awkwardly in\nthe corner, as if the idea of his being helpful with anything was an affront to\nreason. Vick still wasn’t sure why she’d brought him. Perhaps because she\nhad no one else to bring.\n“Not need my help, Superior,” she said. No bear, badger or wasp was\nmore territorial than a Superior of the Inquisition, after all. “But I don’t\nhave to tell you how damaging it would be, financially, politically,\ndiplomatically… if Westport voted to leave the Union.”\n“No,” said Lorsen crisply. “You do not.” As Superior of Westport, he’d\nbe looking for a job.\n“Which is why His Eminence felt you could perhaps use my help.”\nLorsen set down the letter, adjusted its position on his desk and stood.\n“Forgive me if I am dubious, Inquisitor, but performing surgery upon the\npolitics of one of the world’s greatest cities is not quite the same as\nsmashing up a strike.” And he opened the door onto the high gallery.\n“The threats are worse and the bribes better,” said Vick as she followed\nhim through, Tallow shuffling behind, “but otherwise I imagine there are\nsimilarities.”\n“Then may I present to you our unruly workers: the Aldermen of\nWestport.” And Lorsen stepped to the balustrade and gestured down below.\nThere, on the floor of Westport’s cavernous Hall of Assembly, tiled with\nsemi-precious stones in geometric patterns, the leadership of the city was\ndebating the great question of leaving the Union. Some Aldermen stood,\nshaking fists or brandishing papers. Others sat, glumly watching or with\nheads in hands. Others bellowed over each other in at least five languages,\nthe ringing echoes making it impossible to tell who was speaking, let alone\nwhat was being said.

A group of five or six had paused for tea in a\ndistant corner. Men of every shape, size, colour and culture. A cross section\nthrough the madly diverse population of the city they called the Crossroads\nof the World, wedged onto a narrow scrap of thirsty land between Styria\nand the South, between the Union and the Thousand Isles.\n“Two hundred and thirteen of them, at the current count, and each with a\nvote.” Lorsen pronounced the word with evident distaste. “When it comes\nto arguing, the citizens of Westport are celebrated throughout the world, and\nthis is where their most dauntless arguers stage their most intractable\narguments.” The Superior peered towards a great clock on the far side of the\ngallery. “They’ve been at it for seven hours already today.”\nVick was not surprised. There was a stickiness to the air from all the\nbreath they’d wasted. The Fates knew she was finding Westport more than\nhot enough, even in spring, but she had been told that in summer, after\nparticularly intense sessions, it could sometimes rain inside the dome. A sort\nof spitty drizzling back of all their high-blown language onto the furious\nAldermen below.\n“Seems the opinions are somewhat entrenched down there.”\n“I wish they were more so,” said Lorsen. “Thirty years ago, after we\nbeat the Gurkish, you couldn’t have found five votes for leaving the Union.\nBut the Styrian faction has gained a great deal of ground lately. The wars.\nThe debts. The uprising in Valbeck. The death of King Jezal. And his son is,\nshall we say, not yet taken seriously on the international stage. Without\nmincing words—”\n“Our prestige is in the night pot,” Vick finished for him.\n“We joined the Union because of their military might!” A truly mighty\nvoice boomed out, finally cutting through the hubbub. The speaker was\nthickset, dark-skinned and shaven-headed with strangely gentle gestures.\n“Because the Empire of Gurkhul threatened us from the south and we\nneeded strong allies to deter them. But membership has cost us dear!\nMillions of scales in treasure and the price forever rises!”\nAgreement floated up to the gallery in an echoing murmur.\n“Who’s the man with all the voice?” asked Vick.\n“Solumeo Shudra,” said Lorsen, sourly. “The leader of the pro-Styrian\nfaction and a royal thorn in my arse. Half-Sipanese, half-Kadiri. A fitting\nemblem for this cultural melting pot.”\nVick knew all this, of course. She made a great deal of effort to go into\nevery job well informed. But she preferred to keep her knowledge to herself\nwhenever possible, and let others imagine themselves the great experts.\n“During the forty years since we joined the Union, the world has\nchanged beyond all recognition!” bellowed Shudra. “The Empire of\nGurkhul has crumbled, while Styria has turned from a patchwork of feuding\ncity-states into one strong nation under one strong king.

        "text": "Gurkhul has crumbled, while Styria has turned from a patchwork of feuding\ncity-states into one strong nation under one strong king. They have defeated\nthe Union in not one, not two, but three wars! Wars waged for the vanity\nand ambitions of Queen Terez. Wars we were dragged into at vast expense\nin silver and blood.”\n“He talks well,” said Tallow, softly.\n“Very well,” said Vick. “He almost has me wanting to join Styria.”\n“The Union is a waning power!” boomed Shudra. “While Styria is our\nnatural ally. The hand of the Grand Duchess Monzcarro Murcatto is\nextended to us in friendship. We should seize it while we still can. My\nfriends, I urge you all to vote with me to leave the Union!”\nLoud boos, but even louder cheers. Lorsen shook his head in disgust. “If\nthis were Adua, we could march in there, drag him from his seat, force a\nconfession and ship him off to Angland on the next tide.”\n“But we’re a long way from Adua,” murmured Vick.\n“Both sides worry that an open display of force might turn the majority\nagainst them, but things will change as we move towards the vote. The\npositions are hardening. The middle ground is shrinking. Murcatto’s\nMinister of Whispers, Shylo Vitari, is mounting an all-encompassing\ncampaign of bribery and threats, blackmail and coercion, while printed\nsheets are flung from the rooftops and painted slogans spring up faster than\nwe can scrub them off.”\n“I’m told Casamir dan Shenkt is in Westport,” said Vick. “That Murcatto\nhas paid him one hundred thousand scales to shift the balance. By any\nmeans necessary.”\n“I had heard… the rumours.”\nShe got the sense that Lorsen had heard the same rumours she had,\ndelivered in breathless whispers with a great deal of lurid detail. That\nShenkt’s skills went beyond the mortal and touched the magical. That he\nwas a sorcerer who had damned himself by eating the flesh of men. Here in\nWestport, where calls to prayer echoed hourly over the city and cut-price\nprophets declaimed on every corner, such ideas were somehow harder to\ndismiss.\n“Might I lend you a few Practicals?” Lorsen peered at Tallow. To be fair,\nthe lad didn’t look as if he could stand up to a stiff breeze, let alone a flesh-\neating magician. “If Styria’s most famous assassin is really on the prowl,\nwe need you well protected.”\n“An armed escort would send the wrong message.” And would do no\ngood anyway, if those rumours really were true. “I was sent to persuade, not\nintimidate.”\nLorsen was less than convinced. “Really?”\n“That’s how it has to look.”\n“Little would look worse than the untimely death of His Eminence’s\nrepresentative.”\n“I don’t intend to rush at the grave, believe me.”\n“Few do. The grave swallows us all regardless.”\n“What are your plans, Superior?”\nLorsen took a weary breath. “I have my hands full protecting our own\nAldermen. The ballots are cast in nineteen days, and we cannot afford to\nlose a single vote.”"

The ballots are cast in nineteen days, and we cannot afford to\nlose a single vote.”\n“Taking away some of theirs would help.”\n“Providing it is done subtly. If their people turn up dead, it is sure to\nharden feelings against us. Things are finely balanced.” Lorsen clenched his\nfists on the railing as Solumeo Shudra boomed out another speech lauding\nthe benefits of Styria’s welcoming embrace. “And Shudra has proved\npersuasive. He is well loved here. I am warning you, Inquisitor—don’t go\nafter him.”\n“With all due respect, the Arch Lector has sent me to do the things you\ncan’t. I only take orders from him.”\nLorsen gave her a long, cold stare. Probably it was a look that froze the\nblood in people used to Westport’s warm climate, but Vick had worked\ndown a half-flooded mine in an Angland winter. It took a lot to make her\nshiver. “Then I am asking you.” He pronounced each word precisely. “Don’t\ngo after him.”\nBelow them, Shudra had finished his latest thunderous contribution to\nnoisy applause from the men around him and even noisier booing from the\nother side. Fists were shaken, papers were flung, insults were grumbled.\nNineteen more days of this pantomime, with Shylo Vitari trying everything\nto twist the outcome. Who knew how that would turn out?\n“His Eminence wants me to keep Westport in the Union.” She headed\nfor the door with Tallow at her heels. “At any cost.”\nA Sea of Trouble\n“W\nelcome, one and all, to this fifteenth biannual meeting of Adua’s Solar\nSociety.”\nCurnsbick, resplendent in a waistcoat embroidered with silver flowers,\nheld up his broad hands for silence, though the applause was muted. The\nmembers used to raise the roof of the theatre. Savine remembered it well.\n“With thanks to our distinguished patrons—the Lady Ardee and her\ndaughter Lady Savine dan Glokta.” Curnsbick gave his usual showman’s\nflourish towards the box where Savine sat, but the clapping now was yet\nmore subdued. Did she even hear a few tattletale whispers below? She’s not\nall she was, you know. Not one half of what she was…\n“Ungrateful bastards,” she hissed through her fixed smile. Could it only\nhave been a few months since they were soiling their drawers at the\nmention of her name?\n“To say that it has been a difficult year…” Curnsbick frowned down at\nhis notes as though they made sad reading. “Hardly does justice to the\ntroubles we have faced.”\n“You’re fucking right there.” Savine dipped behind her fan to sniff up a\npinch of pearl dust. Just to lift her out of the bog. Just to keep some wind in\nthe sails.\n“A war in the North. Ongoing troubles in Styria. And the death of His\nAugust Majesty King Jezal the First. Too young. Far too young.”\nCurnsbick’s voice cracked a little. “The great family of our nation has lost"

        "text": "August Majesty King Jezal the First. Too young. Far too young.”\nCurnsbick’s voice cracked a little. “The great family of our nation has lost\nits great father.”\nSavine flinched at the word, had to give her own eye the slightest dab\nwith the tip of her little finger, though no doubt any tears were for her own\ntroubles rather than a father she had hardly known and certainly not\nrespected. All tears are for oneself, in the end.\n“Then the terrible events in Valbeck.” A kind of sorry grumble around\nthe theatre, a stirring below as every head was shaken. “Assets ruined.\nColleagues lost. Manufactories that were the wonder of the world left in\nruins.” Curnsbick struck his lectern a blow. “But already new industry rises\nfrom the ashes! Modern housing on the ruins of the slums! Greater mills\nwith more efficient machinery and more orderly workers!”\nSavine tried not to think of the children in her mill in Valbeck, before it\nwas destroyed. The bunk beds wedged in among the machines. The stifling\nheat. The deafening noise. The choking dust. But so awfully orderly. So\nterribly efficient.\n“Confidence has been struck,” lamented Curnsbick. “Markets are in\nturmoil. But from chaos, opportunity can come.” He gave his lectern\nanother blow. “Opportunity must be made to come. His August Majesty\nKing Orso will lead us into a new age. Progress cannot stop! Will not be\npermitted to stop! For the benefit of all, we of the Solar Society will fight\ntirelessly to drag the Union from the tomb of ignorance and into the sunny\nuplands of enlightenment!”\nLoud applause this time, and in the audience below, men struggled to\ntheir feet.\n“Hear! Hear!” someone brayed.\n“Progress!” blurted another.\n“As inspiring as any sermon in the Great Temple of Shaffa,” murmured\nZuri.\n“If I didn’t know better, I’d say Curnsbick has taken a stiffener himself,”\nsaid Savine, and she ducked behind her fan and sniffed up another pinch.\nJust one more, to get her ready for the fight.\nBattle was already joined beneath the great chandeliers in the foyer. A\nsparser melee than at recent meetings. Less buoyant. More bitter. Hungrier\ndogs, snapping over leaner pickings.\nThe press reminded her of the crowd in Valbeck when the Breakers\nbrought food around the slum. They wore silk rather than rags, they stank of\nperfume rather than stale sweat, the ever-present threat was of ruin rather\nthan violence, but the jostling and the hunger were very much the same.\nThere had been a time when Savine was as comfortable in this crawling\nactivity as a queen bee in her hive. Now her whole body tingled with chilly\npanic. She had to smother the urge to lash out with her elbows and run\nscreaming for the door.\n“Calm,” she mouthed to herself, trying to let her shoulders relax so her\nhands would stop shaking, instantly losing all patience and flexing every\nmuscle instead. “Calm, calm, calm.”\nShe squeezed her face into a smile, snapped out her fan and forced"

        "text": "hands would stop shaking, instantly losing all patience and flexing every\nmuscle instead. “Calm, calm, calm.”\nShe squeezed her face into a smile, snapped out her fan and forced\nherself into the midst of the press with Zuri at her shoulder. Eyes turned in\nher direction, expressions harder than she was used to. Assessing, rather\nthan admiring. Scornful, rather than envious. They used to crowd around\nher like pigs around the one trough in the farmyard. Now the most tempting\nmorsels went elsewhere. Savine could scarcely see Selest dan Heugen\nthrough the swarm of gentlemen competing for her attention. Only a flash\nof that garish red wig. A snatch of that hideous, brash, overdone laugh that\nother women were beginning to imitate.\n“By the Fates, I despise that woman,” muttered Savine.\n“The highest compliment you could pay her,” said Zuri, with a warning\nglance up from her book. “One cannot despise a thing without\nacknowledging its importance.”\nShe was right, as always. Selest had enjoyed success after success since\nshe invested in that scheme of Kaspar dan Arinhorm’s, the one that Savine\nhad so pointedly turned down. Her own interests in Angland’s mines had\ntaken quite the beating since he began to install his new pumps across the\nprovince.\nAnd those were far from her only disappointing investments of late.\nOnce she made businesses bloom just by smiling at them. Now every apple\nshe bit into turned out rotten. She was not left alone, that was sure. But her\nfan was busier beckoning the suitors in than waving them off.\nShe was obliged to talk to old Ricart dan Sleisholt, who had some mad\nfantasy of making power by damming the Whiteflow. You could tell at a\nglance he was one of life’s losers, the shoulders of his jacket liberally\ndusted with dandruff, but it was vital that she look busy. While he blathered\non, she sifted the flood of conversation around her for opportunities as a\nprospector sifts the Far Country’s icy streams for gold.\n“… cutlery and drapery and crockery and clocks. People have money\nand they want things…”\n“… heard Valint and Balk called in his loans. Magnate in the morning,\nbeggar by afternoon. Salutary lesson for all of us…”\n“… property in Valbeck. You wouldn’t believe the price I got on some\nvacant land. Well, I say vacant, but these scum are easily moved…”\n“… impossible to know which way the Closed Council is going to fall\non tax. There’s a hell of a hole in the finances. The entire treasury’s a\nhole…”\n“… told ’em if they wouldn’t do the work, I’d bring in a crowd of brown\nbastards who would, and they soon got back to their machines…”\n“… nobles furious, commoners furious, merchants furious, my wife isn’t\nfurious yet, but it never takes much…”\n“And so you see, Lady Savine,” Sleisholt was working up to a grand\nfinale, “the power of the Whiteflow is languishing unharnessed, like a\nstallion unbridled, and—”\n“If I may!” Curnsbick caught Savine’s elbow and steered her nimbly\naway."

No! I could scarcely be less so. You must have sunk thousands\ninto financing the Crown Prince’s Division.” It had been closer to millions.\n“Then I hear Kort’s canal is hampered by labour problems.” Utterly mired\nin them was closer to it. “And it’s no secret you lost heavily in Valbeck—”\n“You have no fucking idea what I lost in Valbeck!” He stepped back,\nstartled, and she realised she had her fist clenched tight around her folded\nfan and was shaking it in his face. “You… have no idea.” She was shocked\nto find the pain of tears at the back of her nose, had to snap her fan open\nagain so she could dab at her lids, struggling not to smudge her powder.\nNever mind her judgement, it was getting to the point where she could\nhardly trust her own eyes.\nBut when she glanced up, Curnsbick was not even looking at her. He\nwas staring across the busy foyer towards the door.\nThe eager chatter fell silent, the crowd split and through the midst came\na young man with a vast retinue of guards, officers, attendants and hangers-\non, sandy hair carefully arranged to give the impression of not having been\narranged at all, white uniform heavy with medals.\n“Bloody hell,” whispered Curnsbick, gripping Savine’s elbow, “it’s the\nbloody king!”\nWhatever the criticisms—and there were more than ever, regularly\ncirculated in pamphlets revelling in the tawdry details—no one could deny\nthat King Orso looked the part. He reminded Savine of his father. Of their\nfather, she realised, with an ugly twisting of disgust. He chuckled, slapped"

        "text": "that King Orso looked the part. He reminded Savine of his father. Of their\nfather, she realised, with an ugly twisting of disgust. He chuckled, slapped\narms, shook hands, traded jokes, the same beacon of slightly absent good\nhumour King Jezal had once been.\n“Your Majesty,” frothed Curnsbick, “the Solar Society is illuminated by\nyour presence. I fear we had to begin the addresses without you.”\n“Never fear, Master Curnsbick.” Orso clapped him on the shoulder like\nan old friend. “I can’t imagine I would have been much help with the\ntechnical details.”\nThe great machinist produced the most mechanical of laughs. “I am sure\nyou know our sponsor, Lady Savine dan Glokta.”\nTheir eyes met only for an instant. But an instant was enough.\nShe remembered how Orso used to look at her. That mischievous glint in\nhis eye, as if they were players in a delightful game no one else knew about.\nBefore she learned they had a father in common, when he was still a crown\nprince and her judgement was considered unimpeachable. Now his stare\nwas flat, and dead, and passionless. A mourner at the funeral of someone he\nhad hardly known.\nHe had asked her to marry him. To be his queen. And all she had wanted\nwas to say yes. He had loved her, and she had loved him.\nTheir eyes only met for an instant. But an instant was all she could\nstand.\nShe sank into the deepest curtsy she could manage, wishing she could\nkeep sinking until the tiled floor swallowed her. “Your Majesty…”\n“Lady Selest!” she heard Orso say, his heel clicking sharply as he turned\naway. “Perhaps you might show me around?”\n“I’d be honoured, Your Majesty.” And the bubbling of Selest dan\nHeugen’s victorious laughter was as painful as boiling water in Savine’s\nears.\nIt was a slight no one in the entire foyer could have missed. Had Orso\nknocked her down and trodden on her throat, he could scarcely have done\nmore damage. Everyone was whispering as she stood. Scorned, by the king,\nat her own function.\nShe walked to the doors through swimming faces, smile plastered to her\nburning cheeks, and stumbled down the steps into the twilit street. Her\nstomach roiled. She pulled at her collar, but she could sooner have torn\nthrough a prison wall with her fingernails than loosened that triple stitching.\n“Lady Savine?” came Zuri’s concerned voice.\nShe tottered around the corner of the theatre into the darkness of an\nalley, doubled up helpless and sprayed vomit down the wall. Puking made\nher think of Valbeck. Everything made her think of Valbeck.\nShe straightened, dashing the burning snot from her nose. “Even my\nown stomach is betraying me.”\nA strip of light down the side of Zuri’s dark face made one eye gleam.\n“When did your menses last come?” she asked, softly.\nSavine stood for a moment, her breath ragged. Then she gave a hopeless\nshrug. “Just before Leo dan Brock’s visit to Adua. Whoever would have\nthought I’d miss the monthly agonies?”\nProbably her ragged breaths should have turned to choking sobs, and she"

Whoever would have\nthought I’d miss the monthly agonies?”\nProbably her ragged breaths should have turned to choking sobs, and she\nshould have fallen into Zuri’s arms and wept at the colossal mess she had\nmade of herself. Curnsbick was right to worry, the old fool. Her judgement\nhad turned to shit and here was the result.\nBut instead of sobbing, she started to chuckle. “I’m puking,” she said,\n“in a piss-smelling alley, in a dress that cost five hundred marks, with a\nbastard on the way. I’m fucking ridiculous.”\nThe laughter faded, and she leaned against the wall, scraping her sour\ntongue clean on her teeth. “The higher you climb, the further you have to\nfall, and the greater the spectacle when you hit the ground. What wonderful\ndrama, eh? And they don’t even have to pay for a ticket.” She clenched her\nfists. “They all think I’m going down. But if they think I’m going down\nwithout a fight, they should—”\nShe doubled over and brought up more sick. Just an acrid trickle this\ntime. Retching and giggling at once. She spat it out and wiped her face on\nthe back of her glove. Her hand was shaking again.\n“Calm,” she muttered at herself, clenching her fists. “Calm, you absolute\nfucker.”\nZuri looked worried. And she never looked worried. “I will ask Rabik to\nbring the carriage around. We should get you home.”\n“Oh, come, come, the night is young.” Savine fished out her box for\nanother pinch of pearl dust. Just to get over the humps. Just to keep things\nmoving. She headed for the street. “I’ve a mind to watch Master Broad\nwork.”\nA Routine\n“S\no… you’re happy here, then?”\nLiddy laughed. There’d been weeks when Broad had hardly seen her\nsmile. These days, she laughed all the time. “Gunnar, we lived in a cellar.”\n“A stinking cellar,” said May, grinning, too. It was hard to imagine with\nthe sunset streaming into their dining room through the three big windows.\n“We ate peelings and drank from puddles,” said Liddy, forking another\nslice of meat onto Broad’s plate.\n“We queued to shit in a hole,” said May.\nLiddy winced. “Don’t say that.”\n“I did it, didn’t I? Why fuss over saying so?”\n“It’s the manner of expression I’m objecting to.” Liddy was getting to\nact like a proper lady and enjoying every moment. “But yes, we did it. Why\nwouldn’t we be happy now?” She pushed across the gravy jug. Broad had\nnever guessed there was such a thing as a special kind of jug for gravy, let\nalone imagined he might own one.\nHe smiled, too. Made himself smile. “’Course. Why wouldn’t we be\nhappy now?” He scooped up a forkful of peas, even managed to get a few\nin his mouth before they all fell off.\n“You’re not much good with a fork,” said May.\nBroad nudged his food around the plate with it.

Just holding the damn\nthing made his hand hurt. Felt too delicate for his aching fingers. “You\nreach an age it’s hard to learn new ways, I reckon.”\n“You’re too young to be stuck in the past.”\n“I don’t know.” Broad frowned as he prodded at that slice of meat, a\nlittle blood seeping. “The past has a way of holding on.”\nAn awkward pause at that. “Tell us you’re staying home tonight,” said\nLiddy.\n“Wish I could. Got to head over to the diggings.”\n“At this time?”\n“Won’t take long, I hope.” Broad set down his cutlery and stood. “Got to\nmake sure the work keeps going.”\n“Lady Savine can’t do without you, eh?”\nMay proudly puffed up her chest. “Told me she relies on him more and\nmore.”\n“Well, tell her she has to share you with your family.”\nBroad snorted as he came around the table. “You bloody tell her.”\nLiddy was still smiling as she tipped her face up, lips soft against his.\nShe’d put weight on. They all had, since the lean times in Valbeck. She had\nthat curve to her figure and that glow to her cheek she’d had when they first\ncourted. That same smell she’d had when they first kissed. All that time\npassed, and he loved her just the same.\n“Worked out all right,” she said, fingertips light on his cheek. “Didn’t\nit?”\n“No thanks to me.” He had to talk around a lump in his throat. “I’m\nsorry. For all the trouble I brought—”\n“That’s behind us,” said Liddy, firm. “We work for a fine lady now. No\ntrouble here.”\n“No,” said Broad. “No trouble.” And he trudged towards the door.\n“Don’t work too hard, Da!” called May. When he looked back, she was\nsmiling at him, and that smile caught at something. Like there was a hook\nin his chest and whatever she did tugged at it. He smiled back. Raised an\nawkward hand in farewell. Then he saw the tattoo on the back and jerked it\ndown. Worked it into the cuff of his fine new jacket.\nHe made sure he shut the door firmly behind him.\nBroad strode through a forest of flaking iron columns, across the darkened\nwarehouse floor towards an island of lamplight, footfalls echoing in all that\ninky emptiness.\nHalder stood with his arms folded and his face in shadow. He was one of\nthose men who liked his silence. Bannerman leaned against a pillar near\nhim, that cocky tilt to his hips. He was one of those men who always had\ntoo much to say.\nTheir guest sat in one of three battered old chairs, hands tied to the back,\nankles to the legs. Broad stopped in front of him, frowning down. “You’re\nGaunt?”\n“I’m Gaunt.” Didn’t try to deny it, at least. Sometimes they did.

Broad\ndidn’t blame them.\n“Funny name for him,” said Bannerman, looking at Gaunt like he was\nnaught but a lump of clay. “’Cause he’s quite sturdy, really. Wouldn’t call\nhim fat. But I wouldn’t call him gaunt.”\n“Have some respect, eh?” said Broad as he took his jacket off. “We can\ndo this without being disrespectful.”\n“What difference does it make?”\nBroad draped the jacket over the back of a chair and stroked the fine\ncloth flat with the side of his hand. “Makes some to me.”\n“We’re not here to make friends.”\n“I know why we’re here.” Broad met Bannerman’s eye, and held it till\nhe licked his lips and looked away. Then he shifted the chair around so it\nfaced Gaunt and sat. He pushed his lenses up his nose, then clasped his\nhands. He found it helped to have a routine. Like when he swept the\nbrewery in Valbeck. Just a job to get done, like any other.\nGaunt watched him all the while. Scared eyes, of course. Sweat on his\nforehead. Determined, though. Tough man to break, most likely. But\nanything breaks if you squeeze it hard enough.\n“My name’s Broad.” He saw Gaunt looking at the tattoo on the back of\nhis hand. He let it hang there. “Used to be in the army.”\n“We all did,” said Bannerman.\n“You know who we work for now?”\nGaunt swallowed. “For Kort?”\n“No.”\nGaunt swallowed again, harder. “For Savine dan Glokta.”\n“That’s right. We hear you’ve been organising, Master Gaunt. We hear\nyou’ve persuaded the workers to down tools.”\nBannerman made a disapproving tut, tut, tut noise with his tongue.\n“Way things are in the diggings,” said Gaunt, “the hours they work and\nthe pay they get, they didn’t need much persuading.”\nBroad nudged his lenses down to rub at the sore bridge of his nose, then\nnudged them back up. “Look. You seem a decent man so I’m giving you\nevery chance I can. But Lady Savine wants her canal finished. She’s paid\nfor it. And I can tell you for a fact… it’s a bad idea to get between her and\nwhat she’s paid for. A bad idea.”\nGaunt leaned forward. Far as he could tied to the chair. “A lad died the\nother day. Crushed by a beam. Fourteen years old.” He strained around to\nglance up at Bannerman. “You know that?”\n“I heard,” said Bannerman, and from the way he was looking at his\nnails, hadn’t cared a shit.\n“It’s a damn shame.” Broad snapped his aching fingers to bring Gaunt’s\neyes back to him. “The question is, how’s you getting crushed going to help\nhim?”\nGaunt stuck his chin up, still defiant. Broad liked him. They could’ve\nbeen on the same side. He supposed they had been, not that long ago. “I can\nhelp the others. The likes of you wouldn’t understand.”\n“I might surprise you. I was in Valbeck, brother, with the Breakers."

Before that, I was in\nStyria. Thought I fought the good fight there, too. Been fighting good fights\nall my life. You know what it’s got me?”\n“Nothing?” said Bannerman.\nBroad frowned up at him. “You love to spoil the punchline, don’t you?”\n“You need some new material.”\n“Daresay you’re right. Trouble with the good fight, I find… once the\nfight starts, the good stops.” Broad began rolling up his sleeves while he\nthought about what to say. Slowly. Carefully. Helped to have a routine. He\ntold himself this was for May, and for Liddy. Wondered what they’d say if\nthey knew about it and didn’t like the answer. That’s why they couldn’t\nknow. Not ever.\n“I’ve killed… I think… maybe fifty men. Maybe more. Prisoners, some\nof ’em. Just following orders, but… I did it, still. Kept a count at first, then I\ntried to lose count, but, well…” Broad looked down at the little patch of\nground between Gaunt’s boots. “I’ll be honest, I was drunk for a lot of it.\nDrunk as I could get. Bit of a blur. I remember this one fellow, in the wars.\nStyrian, I guess, kept gabbling at me, and I hadn’t a clue what he was\nsaying. I threw him off the wall. Wall of Musselia this was so, what, thirty\nstrides high?” He glanced up at Halder. “You were at Musselia, weren’t\nyou?”\nHalder nodded. “Closer to twenty.”\n“High enough, anyway. He hit this cart.” Broad stuck his hand into his\nribs, trying to show where. “And it folded him right in half, sideways. Left\nhim in a shape no living man should ever be. I mean, his feet were pointing\nbackwards. He started making this noise.” Broad slowly shook his head. “I\nswear, it was the noise hell makes. And he wouldn’t stop. You see some shit\nout there. Changes the way you look at things.”\n“It does,” said Halder.\nGaunt was staring at him. “You think that’s something to boast of?”\n“Boast of?” Broad stared back, over the rims of his lenses, so Gaunt was\njust a sparkly blur in the lamplight. “Fuck, no. I wake up with the sweats. I\ncry, sometimes. In the quiet times. Don’t mind admitting it.”\n“Me, too,” said Halder.\n“I’m just… trying to get you to see.” And Broad nudged his lenses back\nup his nose, back into that little groove. “To see where this is going before\nwe get there and find out… we really didn’t want to get there.” He winced.\nThat’d come out all wrong. Wished he was better with words, but, being\nhonest, words alone rarely got this kind of job done. Malmer had been a\ngood talker. Look where he’d ended up. “What I’m trying to say—”\n“Master Broad?”"

There was a single light burning in the office, built\nup on columns at the back of the warehouse. A figure stood by the steps\nleading up to it. A woman’s figure, tall and slight and graceful.\nBroad felt an ugly twist of fear in the pit of his stomach. Small women\ntroubled him a lot more than big men these days.\n“Just… hold on,” he said as he stood.\n“He’s not going anywhere.” And Bannerman patted Gaunt on the side of\nhis face and made him flinch.\n“Respect.” Broad strode across the warehouse floor, footsteps echoing.\n“Not like it costs anything.”\nIt was Zuri. She looked worried, and that made him worried. She was\nabout as hard to rattle as anyone Broad had ever met.\n“What’s wrong?” he asked.\nShe nodded up the steps towards the office. “Lady Savine is here.”\n“She’s here now?”\n“She wants to watch you work.” That sat there for a moment, between\nthem, in the darkness. Doing it was one thing. He could tell himself he had\nto. Choosing to watch it was another. “Perhaps you could… persuade her\nnot to?”\nBroad winced. “If I could persuade people just by talking I wouldn’t\nhave to persuade ’em the other way.”\n“My scripture teacher used to say that those who strive and fail are as\nblessed as those who succeed.”\n“That ain’t been my experience.”\n“Trying cannot hurt.”\n“That ain’t been my experience, either,” muttered Broad, following her\nup the steps.\nFrom the door, Savine looked her usual, perfectly controlled self. Close\nup in the lamplight, he could tell something was wrong. There was a sore\npinkness around the rims of her nostrils, an eager brightness to her eyes, a\nstrand of hair stray from her wig. Then he spotted the streak of faint stains\non her jacket, as shocking as no clothes at all might’ve been on someone\nelse.\n“Lady Savine,” he said. “Sure you want to be here for this?”\n“Your concern is ever so sweet, but I have a strong stomach.”\n“I don’t doubt it. I’m not thinking o’ you.” He dropped his voice. “Truth\nis, you bring out the worst in me.”\n“Your problem, Master Broad, is you confuse your best with your worst.\nI need work to continue on the canal first thing tomorrow. First thing. I\nneed it open and making me money.” She snarled the last word, teeth bared,\nher fury setting his heart thumping. She was a head shorter than him. He’d\nhave been shocked if she was half his weight. But she still scared him. Not\nbecause of what she might do. Because of what she might get him to do.\n“Now make it happen, there’s a darling.”\nBroad glanced over at Zuri, her black eyes gleaming in the darkness.\n“We all are fingers on God’s hand,” she murmured, with a sorry shrug.\nHe looked down at his own hand, knuckles aching as he slowly curled it\ninto a fist. “If you say so.”"

He told himself he was trying to look eager. To\nact the part. But he’d never been much of an actor. The truth was he\ncouldn’t wait to get there.\nGaunt saw something in Broad’s eye, maybe. He twisted in his chair,\nlike he could twist away from what was coming. But neither of them could.\n“Now wait a—”\nBroad’s tattooed fist thudded into his ribs. The chair rocked back and\nBannerman caught it, shoved it forward again. Broad’s other fist sank into\nGaunt’s other side and twisted him, eyes bulging. He stayed like that,\nquivering, face turning purple, for a moment. He got one little wheezing\nbreath in before he puked.\nIt spattered in his lap, spattered the warehouse floor, and Bannerman\nstepped back, frowning down at his shiny new boots. “Oh, we got a\ngusher.”\nTook an effort, not to keep punching. Took an effort, for Broad to keep\nsome kind of grip on himself and speak. When he did, it was strange how\ncalm his voice sounded. “Time’s up on the civilised approach. Bring him\nout.”\nHalder came from the darkness, dragging someone with him. A young\nlad, roped up, gurgling into a gag.\n“No,” croaked Gaunt as Halder shoved the lad down and Bannerman\nstarted tying him to a chair. “No, no,” a string of drool still hanging from\nthe corner of his mouth.\n“A man can take a lot, when he thinks he’s fighting the good fight. I\nknow that.” Broad rubbed gently at his knuckles. “But seeing it done to\nyour child? That’s something else.”\nThe lad stared around, tears tracking his face. Broad wished he could\nhave a drink. He could almost taste it, on his tongue. A drink made\neverything easier. Easier at the time, anyway. Harder afterwards. He pushed\nthe thought away.\n“Doubt I’ll be boasting ’bout this, either.” Broad checked his sleeves\nwere rolled up right. That seemed important, for some reason. “But when\nyou toss it into all the other shit I done, it hardly even shifts the level.”\nHe glanced up towards the office. Maybe he’d been hoping Savine\nwould be waving at him to stop. But there was no one there. Just the light,\nto say she was watching. A man has to be able to stop himself. Broad had\nnever been any good at that. He turned back.\n“I’d like to get home.”\nHe took his lenses off, tucked them into his shirt pocket and the lamplit\nfaces all turned to smudges.\n“But we’ve got all night if we need it.”\nThe lad’s fear, and Gaunt’s horror, and Bannerman’s carelessness, made\nmuddy blurs Broad could hardly tell one from another.\n“I need you to imagine… the state you two will be in by then.”\nThe lad’s chair squealed on the warehouse floor as Broad shifted it to"

Routine, routine, routine.\n“The one hell makes.”\nBroad knew how he’d have felt, if he’d been tied helpless in one chair\nand May in the other. That was why he was pretty sure it’d work.\n“There’ll be no strike!” gasped Gaunt. “There’ll be no strike!”\nBroad straightened up, blinking. “Oh, that’s good news.” Didn’t feel like\ngood news. Deep down inside it felt like quite the disappointment. It was an\neffort, to make his fists unclench. An effort, to take the lenses from his shirt\npocket, hook them back over his ears. Too delicate for his aching fingers.\n“Your son’ll stay with us, though, just to make sure you don’t have a\nchange of heart.”\nThe lad wriggled as Bannerman dragged him back across the warehouse\nfloor into the darkness.\n“Respect!” called Broad, carefully rolling his sleeves down.\nImportant to have a routine.\nThe Art of Compromise\n“P\nrecision, you dolts!” Filio leaped from his bench to yell at the two\nswordsmen, their steels drooping as they gaped at him. “Speed is nothing\nbut faff and bluster without precision.”\nHe was in his late fifties, but quick and handsome still. Vick might’ve\nhad more grey in her hair than he did. He dropped back beside her,\nmuttering a few more Styrian curses under his breath before switching to\ncommon. “Young men these days, eh? They expect the world served to\nthem with golden cutlery!”\nVick glanced over at Tallow. He looked like he might never have seen\ncutlery, let alone been served with the golden kind. Even dressed smartly in\nPracticals’ black, he reminded her of her brother. That apologetic hunching\nof the shoulders, as if he was always expecting a slap. “Some have to\nhandle hardship,” she said.\n“A little hardship would do my nephew no harm.” Filio shook his head\nas he watched the swordsmen shuffle about the training circle, boards\npolished smooth by generations of soft fencing shoes. “He has fast hands,\ngood instincts, but so much to learn.” He groaned at a wayward lunge. “I\nhope he might represent our city in the Contest in Adua one day, but talent\nis useless without discipline—” He leaped up again. “Come on, you\ndonkey, think about it!”\n“You competed in the Contest yourself.”\nFilio gave her a sly grin as he sank back down. “Have you been\nchecking up on me?”\n“You lost to the future King Jezal in the semi-final. Took him to a last\ntouch, as I recall.”\n“You were there? You can’t have been ten years old!”\n“Eight.” A good liar sticks to the truth whenever possible.

        "text": "“You were there? You can’t have been ten years old!”\n“Eight.” A good liar sticks to the truth whenever possible. She had been\neight when that bout took place, but she’d been huddled in the blackness of\na stinking ship’s hold, shackled to a great chain with her family and a few-\nscore other convicts. All on their way to the prison camps of Angland, from\nwhich only she would return. She doubted that memory would’ve brought\nquite the same delight from Filio, though, his eyes shining at the memory of\npast glories. People are rarely made happy by all the truth.\n“The cheering crowd, the scrape of steel, the Circle laid out before the\ngrandest buildings of the Agriont. The proudest day of my life!” He was a\nman who admired the pomp and structure of the Union. A man who\nappreciated precision and discipline. That was why Vick had worn the full\ndress uniform of an Inquisitor Exempt, boots buffed to a mirror gleam, hair\nparted with a ruler and ruthlessly bound back. Filio waved towards the\nflashing blades. “So, you are a devotee of the beautiful science?”\n“Who isn’t?” Though in fact she wasn’t.\n“And I suppose you have come to gather votes?”\n“His Majesty is extremely keen that Westport remain where it belongs,\nin the Union.”\n“Or His Eminence is?” murmured Filio, eyes never leaving the\nswordsmen as they jabbed and parried. “And who else have you spoken\nto?”\n“You are my first call.” He was the fourth, but in Vick’s experience, you\nhad to take care with the pride of moderately powerful men. They bruised\nmuch more easily than the truly mighty. “Superior Lorsen spoke of you in\nglowing terms. A senior Alderman, well respected on all sides. Someone\nwho could be a unifying voice.”\n“I’m flattered, of course, but the Superior is too kind. If unity was\nsimply a matter of the right voice… Westport might not be so terribly\ndisunited.”\n“Perhaps we can help bring your city together. I know you believe in the\nUnion.”\n“I do! I have, all my life. My grandfather was one of those who brought\nus in to begin with.” Filio’s smile faded. “But there are difficulties. King\nJezal was a known quantity but King Orso is young…” Filio winced as his\nnephew gave a showy flourish of his steels. “And has, by reputation, a\nsurfeit of all the young man’s faults. Your bungling in the wars against\nStyria was far from helpful. And then we have Solumeo Shudra!” Filio\nclicked his tongue. “Have you heard him speak?”\n“Briefly.”\n“So persuasive. So compelling. So very… what’s that word…\ncharismatic. Loved as only politicians free from power—and therefore\nfrom disappointment—ever can be. He’s brought a lot of people around to\nhis way of seeing things. The Union side have no one in his class. All rather\nstodgy. But then it’s difficult, isn’t it, to make a passionate argument for\nwhat you already have? So boring.

        "text": "what you already have? So boring. Whereas the delightful alternative? A\nbouquet of promises! A sackful of dreams! A glorious ship of fantasies,\nundamaged by collision with actually getting anything done.”\n“So His Majesty can count on you to vote the right way?”\n“I wish I could give you an uncompromising Union yes. But I fear, for\nnow…” Filio scrunched up his face with distaste. “I can only go so far as\nthe traditional Styrian perhaps. Here in Westport, at the Crossroads of the\nWorld, balanced between the Gurkish and the Styrians and the Union, we\nhave been obliged to make an art of compromise. I have not lasted so long\nin the politics of the city by sticking too closely to any one set of\nprinciples.”\n“Principles are like clothes,” said Vick, straightening her jacket. “You\nhave to change them to suit the audience.”\n“Precisely so. In due course, perhaps we can discuss my price for\nwearing one set of colours or the other? But it would be folly to pick a side\ntoo early. I might put myself on the losing one!”\nVick supposed she could hardly blame the man. If she’d learned one\nthing in the camps, after all, it was that you stand with the winners.\n“Then we should talk again. As the future takes shape.” Vick stood,\nignoring a sudden twinge through her bad hip, snapped her heels together\nand gave a stiff bow.\nFilio looked rather pleased with it. But not pleased enough to promise\nhis vote. “I hope so. But let us not waste each other’s time until we are sure\nof our arithmetic— Ah!” He sprang up as his nephew’s heel scuffed the\nedge of the Circle. “Watch your back foot, you fool! Precision!”\nA rare breeze washed through Westport’s public gardens, smelling of resin,\nflowers and spice from the market over the wall. It made a hundred varieties\nof foliage flap, rustle and whisper. It flung a cloud of spray from the\nfountain in which the bright spring sun made a short-lived rainbow. Then a\nshadow fell across Vick.\n“Might I sit?” A broad-shouldered woman stood over her, dressed in\nloose linens in the southern fashion. Dark-skinned, strong-featured, with a\nfuzz of clipped grey-black hair.\n“I’m afraid I don’t speak Styrian,” said Vick, in common. Half a lie. She\ncould make herself understood but might not catch every nuance, and in\nnegotiations as delicate as these, she couldn’t risk a mistake. That, and she\npreferred to be underestimated.\nThe woman sighed. “How typical of the Union authorities to send a\nnegotiator who cannot even speak the language.”\n“I thought this was the Crossroads of the World, where all tongues are\nspoken. You must be Dayep Mozolia.”\n“And you must be Victarine dan Teufel.”\n“I have that misfortune.” Vick had reckoned the aristocratic overtones of\nher full name, however awkwardly it fit her now, would suit this meeting\nbest. Mozolia was said to be a hard-headed woman of business, so Vick had\nchosen to present herself as a practical Aduan lady on a trip abroad. Hair\nneatly braided, coiled and pinned.

It had been a while since she wore a skirt, and she\nfelt no more comfortable in it than she did in her name. But then, feeling\ncomfortable is a luxury spies are better off without.\n“How do you like the public gardens?” asked Mozolia.\n“Beautiful. If a little thirsty.”\n“They were a gift to the city from a childless heiress to a vast merchant\nfortune.” Mozolia took her time arranging her long body on the bench. “She\ntravelled the Circle of the World hoping to gather one of every kind of tree\nthat God has made.” She waved towards a towering fur, its lower branches\nentirely bare, its upper ones still clinging to a few dry needles. “Sadly, not\neverything flourishes in our climate.” And she glanced at Tallow, wilting in\nservant’s livery, blotchy face beaded with sweat.\nIt had been a bad idea to bring him. Vick knew she was better off alone.\nA lesson learned fresh in the camps with every family member gone in the\nfrozen ground. Her father, shivering, lips turned blue, shortened fingers\nturned black. Her mother, always asking what she’d done to deserve this, as\nthough deserve had anything to do with it. All the sweat and pain it had\ntaken to get that medicine for her sister. Turning up with the bottle gripped\ntight to find her stiff and cold under the threadbare blankets, her brother still\nholding her hand. Only the two of them left. Vick and her brother. His big,\nsad eyes, just like Tallow’s.\nYou’ll never hold up someone who can’t swim for themselves. In the\nend, they’ll drag you down with them.\nMozolia sighed, stretching one arm across the back of the bench. “But I\ndaresay you have not crossed the Circle Sea to discuss trees.”\n“No. To discuss the forthcoming vote.”\n“People here talk of little else. A momentous decision. But not one that\nyou and I can take any part in. Women cannot be Aldermen, after all.”\nVick snorted. “Women might not sit in the Assembly, but they can still\ncontrol the men who do. You have at least five votes in your pocket.”\nMozolia shrugged her heavy shoulders. “Six. Possibly seven.”\n“I wonder if you might be persuaded to cast them for the Union.”\n“I might be. But not easily. I had one grandparent from Yashtavit, one\nfrom Sikkur, a third from Ospria and a fourth from the Old Empire. I am\nwelcome, or perhaps equally unwelcome, at five different temples in the\ncity. I sometimes forget which version of God I am supposed to be praying\nto. In other nations I would be called a mongrel. In this mongrel city I am\nthe norm.” She smiled out at the yellow lawns, where people of every shape\nand colour walked, sat, chatted in the shade of every strange and wonderful\ntree God had made. “A merchant in fabrics cannot afford to take a narrow\nview. My business stretches across the Circle of the World. Suljuk silks and\nGurkish linens, Imperial cottons and woollens from the North.”"

Suljuk silks and\nGurkish linens, Imperial cottons and woollens from the North.”\n“Not to mention all those fine new textiles spooling from the mills of the\nUnion.”\n“Not to mention those.”\n“It would be a shame, for a merchant in fabrics to be cut off from the\nlargest market in the world.”\n“There would be frustrations, of course, but, like water, commerce\nalways works through the cracks in time. And becoming a part of Styria\nwould offer its own opportunities.”\n“I understand the Serpent of Talins can be a domineering mistress.”\nMozolia’s turn to snort. “As several Union generals have discovered to\ntheir cost. But when people are willing to compromise, she can be\nreasonable. Look how the citizens of Talins have prospered under her rule!\nAnd I rather like the idea of a woman in charge, don’t you? Even a\ndomineering one. We women really should do everything we can to work\ntogether.”\n“Or should we do exactly what the men do, and put sentiment to the\nside, and follow the greatest profit?”\nMozolia smiled, ever so slightly. “Fancy that. You speak Styrian after\nall. I hope His Eminence sent an unsentimental sum of money along with\nyou.”\n“Something better.” Vick flicked open the letter and held it out between\ntwo fingers. The signature of Arch Lector Glokta lurked at the bottom, the\nlethal punchline. “Trade rights once controlled by the Guild of Mercers,\nmanaged by His Majesty’s Inquisition for these last thirty years. His\nEminence is prepared to cut you in, quite handsomely.”\nMozolia took the letter and weighed every word. Vick didn’t rush her.\nShe closed her eyes and tipped her face towards the sun, breathed in the\nperfumed air. So rare, she had a moment to just sit.\n“A nice, neat bribe.” Mozolia lowered the letter. “Well judged.”\n“I understand that here in Westport, you like to be honest about your\ncorruption.”\n“I take it all back, you are positively fluent.” Mozolia rocked her weight\nforward and stood, casting Vick into shadow again. “I shall consider your\noffer.”\n“Don’t take too long. We women really should do everything we can to\nwork together.”\nVick nudged the over-heavy drapes aside to peer into the street. The sun\nwas setting on a largely wasted day, a muddy flare above the maze of\nmismatched rooftops, the thirsty treetops, the puffing chimneys, the spires\nof a hundred temples to a dozen versions of the Almighty. She wondered if\nit helped, to believe in God. Whether it was reassuring or terrifying, to look\nat all this shit and know for sure it was part of some grand plan.\nVick pressed her thumb into her aching hip as she watched the candles\nbeing lit at some Thondish shrine, the lights twinkling in the windows, the\nbobbing torches of guides who led foreigners to Westport’s best hostelries,\nbest eateries, best back-alley muggings.

It was an idiot’s idea of how a palace\nmight be decorated, all velvet and peeling gilt. “What kind of arsehole\narranges to meet in a brothel?”\n“One who likes whores and making people uncomfortable,” said Vick.\nSanders Rosimiche, by all accounts, loved both. A strutting loudmouth, but\none who’d voiced support for the Union in the past, and a vote was a vote.\nPeople often say that bullies should be stood up to, but Vick usually found it\nmore productive to let them bully her. That was why she’d made a rare visit\nto a dressmaker, in the hope of looking as feminine and yielding as\npossible. Hair down and combed with oil in the Westport style. She’d even\nworn perfume, Fates help her. The one thing she’d refused was high shoes.\nIn her line of work, you never knew when you might have to run for your\nlife. Or kick someone in the face.\n“Fuck these things,” she grunted, hooking a finger into her corset and\ntrying vainly to wriggle into a comfortable position. Despite being made to\nmeasure, it fit her incredibly badly. Or perhaps it was cut to fit the woman\npeople would like her to be, not the one she was.\nShe wondered what Sibalt would’ve said if he’d seen her dressed like\nthis. I wish I’d met you sooner, maybe. Things might have been different.\nAnd she’d have said, You didn’t and they’re not. And he’d have given that\nweary smile of his and said, You’re a hard case, Vick, and he’d have been\nright. She caught herself missing him at the oddest times. Missing the\nwarmth of him, the weight of him in her arms, the weight of his arms\naround her. Missing having someone she could touch.\nBut Sibalt cut his own throat when she betrayed him. Thinking about\nwhat he might’ve done was a waste of time.\nShe let the drapes fall and turned back into the room, caught Tallow\nfrowning at her, as if at a puzzle he couldn’t quite find the answer to.\n“Do you have to keep staring?” she snapped.\n“Sorry.” And he shrank back like a puppy got a kick. “It’s just, you\nlook…”\n“Absurd?”\n“Different, I guess—”\n“Don’t forget it’s the same woman underneath. The one who’s got your\nsister for a hostage.”\n“Not likely to forget that, am I?” he snapped, a hint of sullen, useless\nanger showing. Even that reminded her of her brother. The look he used to\nhave when he told her they had to help people, and she told him they had to\nhelp themselves. That wounded righteousness. “Why are you even here?”\n“You know why. The Union’s weak. Enemies everywhere. If we can’t\nhold on to what we already have—”\n“I’m asking why you care a shit. Sent you to the camps, didn’t they?

Because you stand with the winners. She had half a dozen\nanswers to hand. It was just that none of them were any good. Truth was,\nshe could have done anything. Run off to the Far Country like she and\nSibalt had always joked about. But the moment His Eminence said,\n“Westport,” she’d started packing. She was still standing there, mouth half-\nopen but nothing quite coming out, when the door swung wide and\nRosimiche strode in.\nHe hadn’t made quite the effort that she had. He wore a dressing gown\nleft carelessly open to the waist and apparently nothing else, a slice of hairy\nbelly and chest on display.\n“Sorry to keep you waiting,” he blustered, not sounding sorry at all.\nShe forced out a smile. “No need to apologise. I know you are a busy\nman.”\n“You’re right. I was busy fucking.”\nKeeping that smile was an effort. “Congratulations.”\n“I would like to get back to it, so let us be brief. Westport will be joining\nStyria. We share a coastline and a culture. One cannot argue with geography\nand history. I intend no disrespect.” A phrase people only use when they\nintend as much as possible.\n“Disrespect doesn’t bother me,” she said, giving her voice the slightest\nedge. “But it might bother the Arch Lector.”\n“There was a time when men would soil themselves at the mere mention\nof the Cripple.” Rosimiche sneered over at her as he poured himself a glass\nof wine. “But the Serpent of Talins is the power in Styria now. Murcatto has\nbound Styria together while the Union splits at the seams. Nobility and\ngovernment at each other’s throats. And these Breakers…”\nDisrespect didn’t bother her. But that he’d rub her face in it with his\nbrothel and his dressing gown, knowing who she worked for? That was a\nconcern. Seemed he was convinced the Styrian faction would win. Was\ntrying to win their favour by humiliating the Union’s representative.\n“One cannot have great growth without a little pain,” said Vick. “The\nUnion’s industry is the envy of the world. Westport would be cutting herself\noff from her rightful place in the future. I’ve already spoken to several like-\nminded—”\n“That bitch Mozolia? Ha! I hear Shudra already brought her back to his\nside. Better bribes than yours, I daresay. That’s the thing about women, they\nthink with their cunts. Anything that doesn’t involve a cunt, they should\nhave no opinion on. Fucking and babies, that’s all.”\n“Don’t leave out the monthly bleed,” said Vick. “It’s a more versatile\norgan than men give it credit for.” She rarely allowed herself the luxury of\ndisliking a person, any more than liking one. Either could be a weakness.\nBut this bastard was testing her patience.\nRosimiche bristled, annoyed his ham-fisted coarseness hadn’t thrown\nher. He swaggered over, puffed up with scorn. “I hear Murcatto is sending\nCasamir dan Shenkt to the city.”"

Your liver, maybe?” He leered over at Tallow. “Perhaps he\nwould start by butchering your errand boy?”\nAnd suddenly, all she could think of was the look on her brother’s face,\nso hurt and so surprised, when the Practicals stepped from the shadows.\nRosimiche gave a little hoot of shock as Vick’s fist smashed into his\nface. She’d had her brass knuckles hidden behind her, but they were on her\nfist now. He clutched at the curtains as he stumbled back, blood flooding\nfrom his broken nose. She punched him in the side of the jaw with a sick\ncrunch and he fumbled his glass, spraying wine over both of them. Her\nknuckles caught him across the top of the head as he fell, tearing the\ncurtains down with him.\nHe hunched in a ball, gasping and spluttering, and she put her knee on\nhis shoulder and rained down punches on any part of him she could reach.\nShe lost count of the blows.\nSomeone caught her arm, nearly dragged her over. Tallow, wrestling her\nback. “You’ll fucking kill him!”\nVick tore free, breathing hard. Her dress was wine-stained. Her arm was\nblood-spotted. Her hair was tangled across her face and she dragged it back,\noil between her fingers. It wasn’t a style well suited to beating a man.\nRosimiche whimpered, still curled in a ball.\nTallow stared at him with those big, sad eyes. “What d’you do that for?”\nShe hadn’t even thought about it. Hadn’t weighed the risks or the\nconsequences. Hadn’t even considered where to hit him, or how to make\nsure he couldn’t hit back. If he’d been a tougher man, things could’ve gone\nvery badly wrong.\n“Before you brush off His Eminence, Master Rosimiche, you should\nconsider what you owe.” Her voice was harsh now. Slum debt collector\nrather than city lady. She tossed the paper Glokta had given her onto the\nfloor by his knees. “Seven thousand scales and change to the Banking\nHouse of Valint and Balk. They don’t take their friendship with the Union\nas lightly as you.” She nudged the paper towards him with one sensible\nboot and he cringed as it brushed his bare leg. “His Eminence has arranged\nfor them to call in the loan. They’ll take your houses. They’ll take your\nwhores. Never mind Shenkt, they’ll have your fucking liver before they’re\ndone.” Maybe some bullies need to be bullied, after all. She leaned down\nover him, hissing the words. “You’ll vote our way, you understand? Vote\nour way, or we crush you like a tick.”"

Vote\nour way, or we crush you like a tick.”\n“I’ll vode your way,” he blubbered, holding a trembling hand over his\nhead. The little finger was broken sideways. “I’ll vode your way…”\nVick stalked off up the darkened street in a manner not at all suitable for her\nwine-stained dress, the ache in her clenched fist settled to a cold throbbing,\nthe ache in her stiff hip getting steadily worse. Old injuries. A lifetime of\nthem.\nTallow hurried to catch her up. “Guess you can’t say he didn’t ask for\nit.”\nSilence.\n“If you’d left it much longer, I might’ve punched him myself.”\nSilence.\n“I mean, he might not have noticed, but I would’ve punched him, still.”\n“It was a mistake,” growled Vick. “You can’t change the fact the world’s\nfull of arseholes. You can only change how you deal with them.”\nHe gave her a weak grin. “So you’re not carved from wood after all.”\nShe winced as she worked her sore fingers. “For damn sure my hand\nisn’t.”\n“Could be worse. Now folk here’ll know what I’ve never doubted.” He\ngave her a stronger grin. “That you’re the wrong woman to mess with.”\nShe kept her face hard. It never ended well for the people she smiled at.\n“Truth is we’re making no progress. Two weeks left and we’ve lost more\nvotes than we’ve gained. Solumeo bloody Shudra’s too good at this.” She\nrubbed absently at her bruised knuckles. “We have to take him off the\nboard.”\n“Aye, but…” Tallow leaned close to whisper. “You kill him, everyone’ll\nturn against us. Lorsen said so.”\n“Whatever it costs,” said Vick. “That’s what His Eminence told me.”\nTallow had that worried look again. “Easy to say for him who won’t be\npaying.”\nSome Things Never Heal\n“I\n’m going to crush you like a tick,” growled Leo, snapping out a jab and\nforcing Jurand to parry. Just the sound of blades ringing made him feel\nbetter. By the dead, he’d missed the feeling of a sword in his hand.\n“Like you crushed Stour Nightfall?” Jurand jabbed back and steel\nscraped again.\n“That’s right.” Leo darted forward, almost cried out at a horribly\nfamiliar twinge in his wounded thigh, had to check and pretend it had been\na feint, the disappointment almost sharper than the pain.\nJurand came on, grinning. “So you’ll bleed half to death, plainly be the\nworse fighter and only win because I’m an arrogant fool?”\nAntaup, Glaward and Jin all chuckled, of course. Leo didn’t. The more\ntime passed, the less he liked the way his friends told the tale.

In that version, there’d been no mention of\nhis not being able to walk properly ever since.\nAfter actual fighting, sparring had always been Leo’s favourite thing in\nthe world. He tried to find the eager smile he used to wear when he was\ndoing it. Like a cat playing with a mouse. Maybe he wasn’t as good with a\nsword as Stour Nightfall, but he’d always been a damn sight better than\nJurand. He meant to prove it, however much it hurt.\n“Ha!” He snapped Jurand’s blade one way then the other with a pair of\nfierce cuts. That was more like it! He lined up a lunge that would hurt even\nwith a blunted blade, then gasped as his weight went onto his bad leg and it\nnearly folded under him.\nIt was shamefully easy for Jurand to step around his feeble thrust and\nslash at his exposed side. Leo twisted to parry, all off balance, gave a girlish\nscream as pain stabbed through his thigh, then his knee buckled and he\nwent sprawling on the rush matting, clutching at his leg.\n“Bloody hell! You all right?”\n“No!” snarled Leo, slapping Jurand’s hand away. “The leg’s fucking\nworse than ever!” He was sick of pain. He was sick of sympathy. He was\nsick of being angry. He was sick of saying sorry for being angry. Then he\nsaw the hurt on Jurand’s face and struggled to get a grip on himself. “I’m\nsorry. Always thought I could laugh off pain. But it’s all the time. I wake up\nwith it. I go to sleep with it. Getting across a room is a struggle. Leaving\nsomething upstairs is a bloody disaster.”\n“Let me help.” Glaward reached for him like a father for a crying\ntoddler.\n“Get your paws off me!” snapped Leo. “I’m not a bloody cripple!”\nJin and Antaup exchanged a worried glance. Nothing says, “I’m\ncrippled,” louder than the furious insistence that you’re not, after all.\nLeo caught Glaward’s big hand before he took it away and dragged\nhimself up, hopping on his good leg. He stood a moment, breathing hard,\nthen gritted his teeth and accepted the inevitable.\n“Bring me the cane,” he snapped at Jurand.\n“You know what’d make you feel better?” Glaward gave Leo’s\nshoulders a crushing squeeze which made him feel a good deal worse.\n“Getting back in the saddle.”\n“That’s where you belong.” Antaup shook a fist. “Leading the men!”\n“You need a battle to lead them into,” grumbled Leo. “Or should I lead\nthem round and round the Lord Governor’s residence?”\n“There’s always fighting in Starikland,” said Glaward. “Rebels are\ngiving Lord Governor Skald a hell of a time lately. Daresay he’d be glad of\nthe help.”\n“And people hate the Styrians more than ever,” said Antaup. “I hear\nWestport’s a real powder keg. One spark and… poof.” He grinned as he"

One spark and… poof.” He grinned as he\nmimed an explosion. “And the women over there…” He grinned wider as\nhe mimed a bigger one.\nWhitewater Jin combed worriedly at his ever-thickening beard. “Can’t\nsay I fancy fighting the Serpent of Talins. She beat King Jezal three times\nand the bitch is stronger’n ever.”\n“Hardly took Stolicus himself to beat King Jezal,” snapped Leo. But the\nman had a point. The history of reckless charges into Styria was not good.\nGlaward pushed out his bottom lip. “If it’s a weak enemy you’re after, I\nhear the Gurkish are obliging. The Empire’s broken into splinters. No\nProphet. Priests and princes and chiefs and governors all fighting each other\nfor control.”\n“Like the North in the bad old days,” said Jin.\nThe Dogman’s stirring stories had all happened in the North in the bad\nold days. That was when names like Bethod, and Black Dow, and the\nBloody-Nine were made. Names to stir the blood. “Is that so?” muttered\nLeo, clenching his fists.\nAntaup’s brows were very high. “The Union’s got every claim on\nDagoska.”\nLeo raised his to match. “That city should be ours.”\nThe four of them glanced at each other, teetering between joking and\nserious.\n“Can’t deny the weather’s good down there.” Jin patted Leo’s face with\none big paw. “Get some colour back in those cheeks!”\nLeo shoved the Northman’s hand away, but the idea had hold of him.\nJust the thought of being back on campaign was making his leg hurt less.\nReclaiming Dagoska for the Union? Imagine the pamphlets they’d print of\nthat story! They’d have to give him another triumph, and with a better\nreward than some gaudy sword this time around. “Jurand, how would we\nget soldiers down there, do you think…”\nHe was somewhat put out to find his oldest friend staring at him,\nhorrified. “Tell me you’re joking.”\n“What?”\nJurand glared at the others and, like mischievous schoolboys caught out\nby the headmaster, one by one they were forced into sheepish submission.\n“He hasn’t even healed from the last duel to the death and you’re falling\nover yourselves to talk him into another?”\n“You sound like my bloody mother,” snapped Leo.\n“Someone has to. It was bad enough when you were just the Young\nLion. You’re the Lord Governor of Angland now! You have a province full\nof people counting on you. You can’t go charging off to any fight that’ll\nhave you because you’re fucking bored!”\nLeo stood a moment, teeth bared, ready to fight. Then he sagged. He\ncouldn’t stay angry with Jurand for longer than a breath or two. “You’re\nright, you bastard.”\n“He’s always right,” said Glaward, sadly.\n“He is the clever one,” said Antaup, flicking back his dark forelock.\n“Sanity prevails.” Jurand slapped the cane into Leo’s hand and strode\noff, shaking his head."

They\nwere quite the pair of old grumblers, those two. They could’ve won\ngrumbling contests. Which was pretty much what these meetings came\ndown to.\nLeo’s mother cleared her throat. “They ask us to raise an extra hundred\nthousand marks in taxes—”\n“Again?” Leo’s voice went shrill with dismay, while the worthies around\nthe table shook their grey heads. The ones who weren’t entirely bald, at\nleast. They shook bald heads.\n“They say since we have peace in the North revenues should rise, and\nAngland will not need so large an army—”\n“We have peace because we have an army!” Leo tried to leap up, winced\nat a stab through his leg and had to sink back, clenching his teeth, clenching\nhis fists, clenching everything. “What about the cost of the war—are they\npaying that, at least?”\nLeo’s mother cleared her throat again. “They… do not mention it.”\n“Are we the king’s subjects or his bloody livestock?” snapped Mustred.\n“This is unacceptable!”\n“Disgraceful!” growled Clensher.\n“Outrageous!”\n“What the shit?” Leo smashed at the table with a fist and made the\npapers and most of the old men jump. “The bloody arrogance of the\nbastards! In war, all they sent were good wishes and in peace all they send\nare demands! I swear they’d ask for my fruits in a bag if they thought they\ncould get a good price for the damn things!”\n“My lords.” Leo’s mother turned smiling to the room. “Do you suppose\nyou could give us the chamber for a moment?”\nWith tired voices and tired legs, the old lords of Angland shuffled to the\ndoor. They could hardly have looked more tired than Leo felt. As Lord\nGovernor he was buried in responsibilities. If he didn’t spend four hours a\nday at his desk, he’d drown in paperwork. He hardly knew how his mother\nhad done it. No small part of him wished she was still doing it.\n“We support you, Lord Brock.” Mustred’s moustaches vibrated with\nloyalty as he paused in the doorway.\n“We support you whatever.” Clensher’s jowls trembled as he nodded\nagreement. “Damn those bastards on the Closed Council!” And he pulled\nthe doors shut.\nThe gloomy room was silent for a moment as Leo’s anger drained away\nand he worked up the courage to look at his mother. To see that slightly\ndisappointed, slightly exasperated, slightly resigned look she’d been\nperfecting ever since he could remember.\n“Another bloody lecture?”\n“Just an entreaty, Leo.” She took his hand, squeezed it in hers. “I share\nyour annoyance, really I do, but you’re Lord Governor now. You have to be\npatient.”"

You have to be\npatient.”\n“How can I?” He couldn’t bear to sit a moment longer. He twisted his\nhand free and struggled up, half-hopped to the narrow windows and\nwrestled one open, desperate to feel fresh air on his face. He looked out\nacross the rain-shiny roofs of Ostenhorm towards the grey sea, rubbing at\nhis sore leg. “Are you sure I’m cut out for this? Managing petty\ncomplaints? I’m happier at war than at peace.”\n“Your father was just the same. But being Lord Governor is about\nmanaging the peace. The Closed Council know Nightfall respects you—”\n“The Great Wolf only respects the boot across his neck! To disarm us?\nHow can they be so blind? It’s not half a year since we were fighting for our\nlives, without a shred of help from those bastards!”\n“I know. But if you’re furious whenever the Closed Council does\nsomething infuriating, you’ll be furious all the time. Rare anger can be\ninspiring. Frequent anger becomes contemptible.”\nLeo took a breath. Forced his shoulders down. By the dead, he was\nalways angry these days. “You’re right. I know you’re right.” The wind was\nchill outside. He dragged the window closed, gripped his thigh and took a\nfew hobbling steps back to his chair—his prison—and dropped down into\nit.\n“Perhaps you should stop training,” she said softly. “Rest the leg—”\n“I did rest it, and it hurt more. So I trained, and it got worse. So I rested\nit again, and that didn’t help. Nothing bloody helps! I’m trapped by the\nfucking thing!”\n“A change of scene might do you good. We’ve been invited to Lord\nIsher’s wedding. A trip to Adua would present many opportunities.”\n“To kiss the king’s arse?”\n“To make your case to him. You said he was a reasonable man.”\nLeo scowled. He hated when his mother talked sense. It made it damn\ndifficult to fight with her without talking nonsense himself. She and Jurand\nhad him in a relentless bloody pincer movement of rationality. “I suppose\nso,” he grumbled.\n“Then reason with him. Build some friendships on the Open Council.\nMake some allies among the Closed. Use their rivalries to your advantage.\nYou can be charming, Leo, when you want to be. Charm them.”\nHe couldn’t help smiling. “Could you just for once be wrong, Mother?”\n“I’ve tried it a couple of times. It really didn’t suit me.”\n“By the dead, it stinks,” said Leo, face crushed up with pain and disgust as\nthe bandages peeled sticky from his thigh.\n“An odour is entirely natural, Your Grace.” The surgeon nudged his eye-\nlenses back up his nose with his wrist. You’d have thought a man who had\nto wear lenses but use his hands would at least find a pair that weren’t\nconstantly sliding down his nose, but in this, as in so much else, it seemed\nLeo would be disappointed. “Some corruption has found its way into the\nwound.”\n“Corruption? How?”\n“Some injuries simply become corrupt.”"

How?”\n“Some injuries simply become corrupt.”\n“Like everything bloody else,” hissed Leo as the man probed at the\nwound with his thumbs and made it weep a thick yellow tear. It looked like\na red eye, lids stubbornly pressed shut in a refusal to see the truth.\n“I’ve seen men make complete recoveries from the most terrible\ninjuries,” mused the surgeon, as if they were discussing a scientific curiosity\nrather than Leo’s life. “But I’ve seen men die from a thorn-prick.”\n“Very reassuring.”\n“How long ago was it inflicted?”\n“Five months?” grunted Leo through gritted teeth. “No, six—ah!”\n“And from a sword?”\n“The same time and the same sword as these others.” Leo waved at the\nscar on his face, faded to a pale line. The one on his side. The one on his\nshoulder. “But they all healed. This one… seems to be getting worse.”\n“We’ll have to drain it. That should ease the pain.”\n“Whatever you have to do,” whispered Leo, wiping the tears from his\ncheek on the back of his arm.\n“You’re sure you wouldn’t like husk for the—”\n“No!” Leo remembered his father, at the end, raving and drooling. “No.\nI need… to stay sharp.” Though what for? So he could watch his friends\ntrain from a chair? Sit through endless meetings about tax? He should take\nhusk for the pain of that rubbish.\nThe surgeon offered a strip of leather to bite on. “You might want to\nlook away, Your Grace.”\n“I think I will.” Flashing steel used to delight him. Now the glint of the\nsun on the tiny blade was making him feel faint.\nHe was the Young Lion! No man braver! Riding into a line of spears had\nbeen nothing. Now even the idea of moving the leg, touching the leg, using\nthe leg, made him cringe. It was his first thought before he did anything—\nhow much would it hurt? You would’ve thought the more pain you suffered,\nthe more you’d get used to it, but it was the other way around. Hour after\nhour, day after day, it wore down your patience until everything was\nunbearable.\nSo rather than suffer in heroic silence, he trembled and whimpered his\nway through it, sobbing at every touch of the blade. At even the expectation\nof a touch. When it was over, he peeled the wad of leather from his teeth,\nstrings of spit hanging off it. “I swear it hurts more than when I took the\nwound in the first place.”\n“Pain dulls in the excitement of combat.” The surgeon wiped Leo’s thigh\nthen wrinkled his nose at the cloth. “The chronic is, in the end, far harder to\nstand than the acute.”\nLeo lay back, limp as a wrung-out rag. “When will it heal?”\n“Perhaps weeks. Perhaps months.”\n“Months?” He made a fist as though he might punch his own leg, but\nquickly thought better of it.\n“But you should be aware…” The surgeon frowned as he dried his\nhands. “Some things never heal.”\n“It could be like this for ever?”\n“It is a possibility.”"

Like that bastard Glokta, imprisoned behind his\ndesk, burrowing among his papers like a maggot in filth?\nTears made his sight swim. He wished Rikke was with him. She\nwould’ve turned it into a joke, played the fool, made him… feel good. It\nwas a long time since he’d felt good.\n“All done for now.” And the surgeon began to wind a fresh bandage\naround Leo’s thigh, hiding that puckered red eye.\nHe’d dreamed of leading armies and winning great victories, just like in\nthe stories. He’d dreamed of fighting in the Circle and being reckoned a\ngreat warrior, just like in the songs. He’d dreamed of stepping from his\nmother’s shadow into the sunlight of renown and being cheered as Lord\nGovernor of Angland. He’d done it all.\nAnd look where it had left him.\nThat’s the trouble with songs. They tend to stop before it all turns to shit.\nWith the Wind\nD\nownside frowned towards the burned-out shells of hovels and houses.\nCouple of chimney stacks still stood, couple of charred beams poked at the\npink morning sky. He cleared his throat, worked the results around his\nmouth like he was tasting ale, then spat ’em out. He loved a good spit, did\nDownside. Might’ve been his favourite pastime. After killing folk.\n“Just like the village I came from, this,” he said.\n“Aye,” said Clover, “well. Villages all look much the same when they’re\nburned.”\n“You say that like you’ve seen a few.”\n“There was a time back in the wars…” Clover thought about it and gave\na sorry grunt “…’fore you lot were born, I daresay, when burned villages\nwere a more common sight in the North than unburned ones. I’d hoped\nthose days were behind us but, you know. Hoping for a thing often seems\nthe best way o’ bringing on the opposite.” There was another gurgling retch\nbehind and Clover turned to look. “How can you have any puke left?”\n“It’s just…” Flick straightened up, wiping his mouth. “A sort o’ snot\ncoming out now.’ And he peeked at the display from the corner of his eye,\nas if looking sidelong might make it prettier.\nYou could tell it had been people once. A hand here. A face there. But\nmostly just bits of meat, nailed up high or dangling in the burned trees at\nthe centre of the village, where the rain had washed the ash into a black\nslurry. There was something coiled snake-like around a trunk which Clover\nhad an unpleasant sense might be someone’s guts. A scene from a\nnightmare, and no mistake.\n“Fucking flatheads,” muttered Flick, then he hunched over and coughed\nup another string of drool.\n“Chief?”\n“By the dead!” shouted Clover, near jumping in the air with fright."

I near shat myself!” He was worried he might’ve, just a streak.\n“Sorry.” She didn’t look sorry at all. She never looked much of\nanything. Deadpan as an actual pan, this girl.\n“I should hang a bell on you,” muttered Clover, bending over and trying\nto calm his racing heart. “What is it?”\n“The flatheads left tracks. Took some sheep with ’em. Wool tufted on the\ntrees. Tracks all over. Couldn’t have left bigger ones if they’d driven a\nwagon. I could track ’em easy. Want me to track ’em? I’ll track ’em, shall\nI?” Maybe she spent so much time on her own, only trees for company, that\nshe’d poor judgement now on quantity of words. It was either too few in\nlittle stabs or too many in a flurry. “Want to follow, Chief?”\nClover still didn’t much like being called chief. The tallest flower is oft\nthe first clipped, and no one he’d called chief down the years had lived to\nenjoy a pleasurable retirement. “No, I don’t much want to follow, as it\nhappens.” He held a hand out to the nailed-up offal. “Adding my own\ninnards to such a display in no way appeals.”\nThere was a pause. Sholla’s one visible eye, and the gleam of the one\nhidden, slid to Downside, and he shrugged his great shoulders. They slid to\nFlick, who groaned, and straightened, and wiped his mouth again. They slid\nto the display, which still sat there in the trees, of course. They slid back up\nto Clover. “Shall we follow, though?”\nClover puffed out his cheeks. They’d been puffed out ever since Stour\ngave him these scrapings from the pot and told him to hunt Shanka. But\nwhen your chief gives you a task, you get to it, don’t you? Even if it’s far\nfrom the task you’d have picked.\n“Aye,” he grunted. “We shall.”\n“Chief?”\n“Huh?”\nFlick knelt in the wet brush, twisting his spear nervously in his pale fists.\n“What you thinking about?”\nClover stood, trying to find a gap in the leaves so he could peer into the\nvalley, grunted as he stretched one aching leg, then the other, then squatted\ndown again. “The past. Choices made. Things done.”\n“Regrets, eh?” Flick nodded sagely, like he knew all about regrets,\nthough if he’d seen sixteen winters Clover would’ve been surprised.\n“Might be a parade o’ triumphs and successes, mightn’t it?”\n“Didn’t look that way.”\n“Aye, well.” Clover took a long breath through his nose. “You’ve got to"

She flung herself into the\nbushes and slid to a stop in the undergrowth beside Clover, breathing hard\nand her face shining with sweat but otherwise not looking much bothered\nby a deadly chase through the woods.\n“They coming?” asked Flick, voice shrill with fear.\n“Aye.”\n“All of ’em?” asked Downside, voice growly with excitement.\n“Pretty much.”\n“You sure?” asked Clover.\nShe glanced at him through her hair, which had a couple of bits of twig\nstuck in it. “I am irresistible.”\n“No doubt,” he said, with the ghost of a grin. It was the sort of thing\nWonderful might’ve said.\nThen Clover heard ’em, and the grin faded fast. A howling first, like a\npack of wolves far off, making the hairs on his neck prickle. Then a\nclattering and clanking, like armoured men coming on the rush, making his\nmouth turn dry. Then a mad snuffling and gibbering and hooting somewhere\nbetween a crowd of hungry hogs and a gaggle of angry geese, setting his\npalms to itch.\n“Ready!” he hissed, men shifting in the undergrowth all around him,\ngripping their weapons tight. “And as Rudd Threetrees used to say, let’s us\nget them killed, not the other way around!” He gave Sholla a nudge with the\nrim of his shield. “To the back, now.”\n“I can fight,” she whispered. He saw she’d pulled out a hatchet and a\nwicked-looking knife with a long, thin blade. “I can fight better than your\nchampion puker here.”\nFlick looked a little hurt, but he looked a little green, too.\n“I’ve got plenty o’ folk can fight,” said Clover, “but just the one who can\nsneak up on a squirrel. Get to the back.”\nHe saw a flicker of movement in the trees, then another, then they burst\nfrom the branches and into the open, swarming up the gulley, funnelled\nbetween the steep rocks and straight towards Clover. Exactly the way he’d\nplanned. Though the plan didn’t seem such a clever one right then.\nA vile mass they were, whooping and warbling, skittering and scuttling,"

Though the plan didn’t seem such a clever one right then.\nA vile mass they were, whooping and warbling, skittering and scuttling,\nlimping on legs of different lengths, all teeth and claws and mad fury. All\ntwisted and misshapen, mockeries of men, squashed from clay by children\nwith no knack for sculpting.\n“Fuck,” whimpered Flick.\nClover caught his shoulder and gripped it hard. “Steady.” At a moment\nlike that, everyone’s thinking about running, at least a bit, and it only takes\none doing it to convince ’em all it’s the best idea. Before you know it,\nyou’re being hunted through the woods instead of celebrating a victory. And\nClover’s knees were getting far too stiff for doing the hunting, let alone for\nbeing the prey.\n“Steady,” he hissed again as the Shanka scrambled closer, sun glinting\non the jagged edges of their crude weapons and the plates and rivets they’d\nbolted into their lumpen bodies.\n“Steady,” he mouthed, watching, waiting, feeling out the moment. He\ncould see their faces now, if you could call ’em faces. One at the front wore\na bloodstained woman’s bonnet and another waved a man’s rusted sword\nand a third had a horse’s skull over its own face and a fourth a helmet made\nof spoons bent in a fire or maybe they were nailed into its skull, the rough\nflesh swollen around the strips of metal.\nGrab the moment, ’fore it slips through your fingers.\n“Spears!” roared Clover, and men popped from the undergrowth, long\nspears all pointed down the gully so there was nowhere for the flatheads to\nrun to. They checked and clawed and skittered, surprised by that thicket of\nbright blades. One couldn’t stop and went tumbling onto the spears, took a\npoint right through the throat and hung there, spitting dark blood and trying\nto turn around and looking somewhat surprised that it couldn’t.\nClover almost felt sorry for it. But feeling sorry’s always a waste of\ntime, and specially in a battle.\n“Arrows!” he roared, and men leaned out over the rocks at the sides of\nthe gully. Bows sang and shafts fluttered down among the Shanka, bounced,\nrattled, stuck into flesh. He saw one flathead flailing, trying to reach with\none twisted arm to where an arrow was sticking from its neck. The archers\ndrew and strung and shot, easy as shooting lambs in a slaughter-pen. A\nspear went flying up the other way but bounced from a rock, harmless.\nThe flatheads were shook up, now. Seems Shanka and men don’t behave\nall that differently when they’re bottled in a gully with shafts showering\ndown on ’em. One tried to climb the rocks and caught three arrows,\ndropped off on top of another. A third charged at the spears and got stuck\nthrough the guts, ripped open all up its side and a metal plate torn from its\nshoulder, bloody bolts showing underneath.\nClover saw one flathead dragging another that had an arrow in its chest,\ntrying to get it to the back.

Almost like something a person might do. A\nbetter person than he was, anyway. Made him wonder if flatheads had\nfeelings like people, as well as blood and screams much the same. Then an\narrow stuck into the head of the one doing the dragging and it fell with the\nother one on top and that was that for the demonstration of human feelings.\nOn either side.\nClover got the sense they were ready to break.\n“Axes!” he bellowed, and the spearmen split apart, pretty neat. Not too\nfar from what they’d practised, which was quite the wonder under the\ncircumstances. The best fighters Stour had given him came pouring through\nthe gap, mail and shields and good axes smashing into the flatheads from\nuphill with a sound like hail on a tin roof.\nDownside was right at the front, of course. He was a bad bastard. Mad\nbastard. Fought with that total lack of concern for his own safety that men\nusually grow out of fast or die of even faster. Hell of a fighter, but no one\nwanted him ’cause he’d a habit of getting carried away and not really caring\nwho he smashed on the backswing. Or even the frontswing.\nStill, when you’re sent to fight monsters, it’s a good idea to have a\nmonster or two of your own. That, and the way he was never happier’n\nwhen he was charging at the Great Leveller reminded Clover of himself\ntwenty years past, when they still called him Jonas Steepfield and\nmisfortunes hadn’t taught him to tread lightly. He was just congratulating\nhimself on staying well clear of the action when a spearman gave a screech,\ndropped clutching at his shoulder, and a giant flathead came roaring out of\nthe pack, a great studded club in its fists.\nClover never saw a Shanka so big nor so covered in iron. They liked to\nrivet any metal they could find into their skin, but this one was covered all\nover with hammered plates. A mist sprayed from its mouth as it bellowed,\nand it sent a man reeling with its club. Others scrambled back, and Clover\nwas not ashamed to say he was with them, jaw well lowered and shield well\nraised.\nThe great Shanka took a step forward, lifting its club, then squawked\nand dropped wobbling on one knee. Sholla had slipped up behind, now set\nher knife between two of the plates on its head and smashed the pommel\nwith the back of her hatchet calm as hammering a nail. Made this hollow\nbonk and drove the knife into the Shanka’s skull to the grip, popped one of\nits eyes right out of its metal-cased head.\n“Fuck,” said Clover as it crashed down at his feet with a sound like a\nchest full of cooking pots.\n“Told you I could fight,” said Sholla.\nLooked like that was the end of it. The last few flatheads were running.\nClover saw one cut down in a shower of blood, another fall with an arrow\nin its back, a couple bounding away down the gully even quicker than they\ncame.\n“Let ’em go!” Clover roared up at the archers. “They can take the"

They stay north of the mountains, we’ll have no quarrel.\nThey come south, the Great Leveller’s waiting.”\nDownside watched ’em run, eyes wide and wild, spit in his beard and\nblood streaking his face. No one wanted to tell him to stop and honestly\nClover didn’t much, either. But that’s the thing about being chief. You can’t\njust throw your hands up at everything and say it’s someone else’s problem.\nSo Clover stepped towards him, one palm raised, the other just tickling\nthe grip of the knife in the back of his belt. There’s no bad time to have one\nhand on a knife, after all.\n“Easy, now,” like he was trying to calm a mean-tempered dog. “Calm.”\nDownside stared at him, quite mildly, if anything. “I am calm, Chief,” he\nsaid, and wiped blood out of his eyes. “Bleeding, though.”\n“Well, your own face is a poor choice of weapon.” Clover let go his\nknife and surveyed the axe-hacked, spear-stuck, arrow-pricked corpses\nclogging the gully. Fight won, and he hadn’t even needed to swing in anger.\n“By the dead,” muttered Flick. There was a flathead spitted on the end of\nhis spear, still twitching.\n“You got one,” said Downside, putting a boot on its neck and hacking its\nskull open.\n“By the dead,” muttered Flick again, then he dropped his spear and was\nsick.\n“Some things don’t change,” said Sholla, busy trying to prise her dagger\nout o’ the big Shanka’s skull.\n“Worked out just the way you said, Chief.” Downside rolled a dead\nflathead over with his boot and left it goggling at the sky.\n“You should never have doubted me,” said Clover. “The first weapon\nyou bring to any fight ain’t a spear or an arrow or an axe.”\nFlick blinked at him. “Sword?”\n“Surprise,” said Clover. “Surprise makes brave men cowards, strong\nmen weak, wise men fools.”\n“Ugly fuckers, ain’t they?” said Sholla, tugging, tugging, then nearly\nfalling over backwards as her dagger suddenly came free.\n“I find myself on shaky ground when it comes to criticising others’\nlooks. Weren’t you a butcher’s boy once, Downside?”\n“I was.”\n“Reckon you can take the lead on carving these bastards, then.”\n“What d’you want from ’em, sausages?”\nSome of the others laughed at that, ready to laugh at anything now the\nfight was done and they likely had a fat gild coming.\n“Trouble with sausages is you can’t tell what’s in ’em,” said Clover. “I\nwant no one to be in any doubt. Make us a display like they did with those\nfolk at the village. We might not speak the same tongue as Shanka, but\nheads in trees gets the point across in every language. Toss a few in that\nsack for Stour while you’re at it.”"

Toss a few in that\nsack for Stour while you’re at it.”\n“You want to impress a girl, take a bunch o’ flowers.” Flick gave a sad\nsigh. “You want to impress a King o’ the Northmen, bring a sack o’ heads.”\n“’Tis a sorry observation,” said Clover, “but only the truer for that.”\n“Don’t think much o’ flowers myself,” said Sholla.\n“No?”\n“Never saw the point of ’em.”\n“They’ve got no point. That’s the point.”\nShe tipped her head to the side, thinking that one through.\nDownside was frowning at the Shanka corpses, weighing his axe and\nwondering where to start. “Never thought o’ myself as a man who fills sacks\nwith heads.”\n“No one sets off in that direction,” said Clover, puffing out his cheeks\none more time. “But before you know it, there you bloody are.”\nVisions\n“S\nhe’s coming back.”\n“Thank the dead,” Rikke heard her father say in the fizzing blackness,\nand she groaned as she pushed the spit-wet dowel out of her mouth. “But\nthat’s four times this week.”\n“Fits are getting worse,” croaked Rikke. Her teeth ached. Her head was\nsplitting. She prised one eye open, then the other, saw Isern and her father\nlooking down at her. “Least I didn’t shit this time.”\n“To shit you have to eat,” said Isern, hard-faced as ever. “What did you\nsee?”\n“I saw a river full of corpses.” Bobbing and turning, face up and face\ndown. “I saw two old men fight a duel in the Circle, and two young women\nhold hands under a golden dome.” Applause echoing in the gilded spaces. “I\nsaw a flag with an eye upon it, standing behind a high chair.” And someone\nsitting in the chair… who had it been? “I saw an old woman…” Rikke\nwinced and pressed her hand against her left eye, burning hot, and\nshuddered at the memory, still faint on the inside of her lids. “And her face\nwas stitched together with golden wire. She spoke to me…”\nIsern sagged back on her haunches. “I know this woman.”\n“You sure?” asked Rikke’s father.\n“’Tis a distinctive look, d’you not think? She is a witch.” Isern took up\nthe dangling necklace of runes and fingerbones she wore, tattooed knuckles\nwhitening as she squeezed it tight. “She is a woman much loved by the\nmoon, or perhaps much hated.” Rikke never saw Isern-i-Phail look\nanywhere near scared before, and it made her feel scared. Even more scared\nthan usual. “She is a sorceress who returned from the land of the dead.”\n“None escape the Great Leveller,” muttered Rikke’s father.\n“None escape. But they say some few…” Isern’s voice faded to a\nscratchy whisper. “Are sent back.” She leaned close, hard hands gripping\nRikke’s shoulders. “What did she tell you?”"

There is a forbidden\ncave there, beside a forbidden lake. That’s where she lives. If you can use\nthe word about a dead woman.”\nRikke’s father stared. “Do we really want help from a corpse stitched\ntogether with golden wire?”\n“Help with strange problems comes from strange people.”\n“I guess.” Rikke’s father helped her up, the horribly familiar pain\npulsing away behind her eyes. “You should eat something.”\nHer gorge rose at the thought. “I’m not hungry.”\n“You’re skin and bones, girl.”\n“I just need some air. Just need to breathe.”\nIsern pushed the door creaking open and bright daggers glittered along\nits edge, stabbing, stabbing. Rikke closed one eye altogether and the other\nto a slit, groaning as they helped her through the doorway. She felt weak as\na newborn calf. Everything hurt. The soles of her feet. The tips of her\nfingers. The inside of her arse.\nThey helped her onto her father’s favourite bench in the overgrown\ngarden, with the view of Uffrith’s steep streets sloping down to the\nglittering sea. “Oh, the sun’s a bastard,” she muttered, but she managed to\nsmile as the salt breeze came up and kissed her clammy face. “But the\nwind’s a good friend.”\n“Other way around where we’re going,” said Isern, dumping a sheepskin\nabout Rikke’s shoulders. “Up into the hills.”\n“Everything’s a matter of where you stand.” Rikke’s father took both her\nhands in his. “I have to get back to this bloody moot. If I’m not there,\nthey’ll argue.”\n“They’ll argue more if you are there. They’re like bloody children.”\n“We’re all like children, Rikke. The older you get, the more you realise\nthe grown-ups won’t suddenly walk in and set things right. You want things\nright, you have to put ’em right yourself.”\n“With your bones and your brains, eh?”\n“And your heart, Rikke. And your heart.”\nShe squeezed her father’s hands, so thin and crooked. “I worry they’ll\nwear you down.”\n“Me?” He gave a smile that was convincing no one. “Never.”\n“They already have.”\nHe smiled again. Truer this time. “That’s what it is to be chief. You\nmake the hard choices so your people won’t have the trouble of ’em.” He\nglanced about at the weed-choked beds as he stood, brushing off his knees.\n“One day I’ll tame this bloody garden, you’ll see.

        "text": "“One day I’ll tame this bloody garden, you’ll see. You just sit in the breeze,\nnow. Sit and rest.”\nWasn’t like she had much choice. Didn’t have the strength to do much\nelse. She sat and listened to the gulls squawking on the rooftops and the\nbees busy at the garden’s first ramshackle hints of blossom. She watched the\nfishermen on the wharves, the women at the well, the carpenters still\nmending the wounds Stour Nightfall had cut into Uffrith. She wondered if\nher father would live to see it put right again, and the thought made her feel\nsad. Sad and lonely. Who’d she be when he was gone?\nShe closed her eyes again and felt tears prickling. She hardly dared look\nthese days in case she saw something that wasn’t there yet. Hardly dared\nbreathe in case she choked on years-old smoke. Isern had always told her\nthat you cannot force the Long Eye open, but she’d tried, when Leo fought\nhis duel against Stour Nightfall. She’d tried, and seen a crack in the sky.\nShe’d tried, and seen too much, and now she couldn’t force the Long Eye\nclosed again.\n“Hear tell you had a fit.”\nA shaggy shape loomed over her, a dull glint where one eye should be.\n“Hey, hey, Shivers,” she said.\nHe sat beside her, looking out towards the sea. “Hey, hey, stringy.”\n“That’s rude.”\n“I’m an infamous killer. What d’you expect?”\n“One can still kill politely.” It was then she noticed a building not far\naway was on fire. Going up like a torch, it was, flames gouting from the\nwindows and burning straws whirling from the thatch.\nRikke gently cleared her throat. Even that made her head pound. “That\nbuilding over there…” She watched a fire-wreathed figure stagger from the\ndoorway and flop down near the well, no one taking much notice.\n“What, the inn?”\n“Aye. Is it… would you say… on fire, at all?”\nShivers raised his brows at it. Or he raised the one that worked, at least.\n“Not that I can tell. Does it look on fire to you?”\nShe winced as the tottering chimney stack collapsed into the charred\nrafters in a gout of sparks. “Little bit. But I’ve a habit of seeing things that\naren’t there.”\n“Getting worse?”\n“Despite my efforts to look on the sunny side, it seems so.” Rikke felt\ntears in her eyes and had to wipe them away. The left one was hot again. It\nwas always hot, now. “Isern says there’s someone up in the mountains\nmight help. A dead witch whose face is stitched together with golden wire.”\n“That’s your help?”\n“Help with strange problems comes from strange people.”\n“I guess,” he said.\n“At this point, I’ll take any I can get. What’ve you been up to?”\n“I was sitting in this moot of your father’s. They’re talking of the\nfuture.”\n“And what’s in it?”\n“You’re the one with the Long Eye.”\nRikke stared at that burning building that wasn’t really burning. The one"

The one\nnext door had caught fire, too, now, just patches among the thatch. By the\ndead, she wanted to reach for a bucket, but how do you put out flames that\naren’t there yet? Or that burned out long ago? “Fire and discord,” she\nmuttered.\nShivers gave a grunt. “Takes no magic to see that coming. Red Hat\nthinks the Protectorate should be part o’ the Union, with seats on their\nbloody Open Council and everything, I daresay.”\n“Hard to imagine.”\n“Oxel thinks we should kneel to Stour Nightfall.”\nRikke curled her lip and spat, but weak as she was, she got most of it\ndown her front. “Give it all away before he tears it from us?”\n“Or bargain for something while we’ve still got something to bargain\nwith.”\n“What about Hardbread?”\n“He can’t decide one way or the other, so he agrees with whoever’s\ntalking. No one reckons we can stay as we are once your father’s gone. And\nno one reckons he’ll be around much longer.”\nRikke blinked at him. “That’s harsh.”\nShivers’ metal eye twinkled with the colours of fire. “I’m an infamous\nkiller. What d’you expect?”\nBy the dead but the whole of Uffrith was burning now, clouds lit orange\nand yellow and red and the air heavy with screams and clatters of war, and\nRikke gave a groaning sigh, right from her hollow belly, and closed her\nsmarting eyes, and clapped her sore hands over ’em, but even then she\ncould feel the heat pressing on her face, the smoke harsh in her nose.\nSomething was forced between her jaws and she gagged, tried to twist in\na sudden panic but couldn’t move, gripped tight as swelling ice might grip a\ndrowned corpse.\n“She’s coming back.”\n“Thank the dead,” Rikke heard her father say in the fizzing blackness.\n“But that’s four times this week.”\nShe jerked up, pain stabbing behind her eyelids, and spat out the dowel.\n“Fits are getting worse!”\nShe was in her room again. Her teeth ached. Her head was splitting. She\nstared up bleary at her father’s worried face, trying to make sense of it.\n“What did you see?” asked Isern. Again.\n“The river of corpses and the old men fighting and the young women\nholding hands and the flag with the eye and an old woman…” blathered\nRikke, pressing her hand against her left eye, burning hot. “And her face\nwas stitched together with golden wire.” The same words slobbering out.\nThe same words as before. “She said I had to choose.”\nIsern sagged back on her haunches, just like last time, and her jaw\nsquirmed as she worried at the hole in her teeth with her tongue. “What\ndoes that mean?”\n“You know what it means,” snapped Rikke, every word another stab\nthrough her head. “You already told me.”\n“What did I say?”\n“That she’s a witch who was sent back from the land of the dead.

Rikke never saw\nher look scared before. Except just before, in the vision. It made Rikke feel\neven more scared than the last time it happened.\n“Can’t very well disagree with myself, can I?” muttered Isern.\n“Do we really want help from a corpse stitched together with golden\nwire?” asked Rikke’s father, again.\nIsern shrugged. “Help with strange problems—”\n“—comes from strange people,” Rikke finished for her.\nMan of the People\n“S\nnake!” screamed a woman, and Vick recoiled, then realised it wasn’t a\nwarning but a sales pitch. “Best snake meat!”\nShe waved something like a length of red rope in Tallow’s horrified face\nand Vick barged past, shoving people out of the way. Politeness got you\nnowhere in Westport. It didn’t get you far anywhere.\n“Never been nowhere so busy in my life,” gasped Tallow, dodging a\nstringy Suljuk woman juggling gourds. Westport was always too hot but\nwith the ovens, braziers and cook-fires of a dozen different cultures burning\nall around them it was stifling.\nA bearded man loomed up with blades in his hands and Vick went for\nher pocket, but they were only skewers covered in singed lumps of meat.\n“You never tasted lamb so tender!” he roared in Tallow’s face.\n“Thanks, but—”\n“Don’t speak if silence will do,” grunted Vick, dragging him on. “To\nthese folk, ‘no’ is the start of a conversation. There he is.”\nShe caught a glimpse of Solumeo Shudra through the shimmering haze\nabove a great pan of rice, three guards sticking close to him. Two were\nStyrians, big men but none too skilled by Vick’s reckoning. The third was a\nSoutherner with busy eyes and a scarred sword through his belt. The most\ndangerous of the three. The most likely to move fast. But no one can be\nready all the time. Especially in a crowd like this. All it would take was a\nmoment to brush close. A quick movement of the blade. Then away into the\nchaos before anyone realised that the man who might’ve led Westport out of\nthe Union was dead.\n“You sure about this?” Tallow caught her by the elbow, hissing in her ear\nover the rattle of pans, spoons, knives, the calls of the hawkers. “Lorsen\ntold us to leave him be.”\n“If I always did what I was told I’d still be down a mine in Angland. Or\ndead.”\nTallow raised his brows. “Or both?”\n“Probably.” She jerked her arm free and battled through a crowded\narchway after Shudra and his guards, into a spice-market as blinding,\ndeafening and choking in its own way as a Valbeck mill.

Baskets and\nbarrels stood in teetering towers, shelves stacked with gleaming jars of oil.\nThe colours were vivid in the sunlight, powders bright red, orange, yellow,\nleaves every shade of green and brown. Weights and coins rattled and\nclinked, men and women haggling in a dozen languages, screaming out that\nthey had the best goods, the cheapest prices, the fairest measures.\nShudra was ahead, talking with one of the traders in Styrian, then with\nanother in some Kantic tongue, switching between the two and making\nthem both laugh, shaking their hands, clapping their shoulders. Vick\npretended to look at a stall covered in sticks of incense, hardly able to\nbreathe for their reek, keeping one eye on Shudra through the seething\ncrowd. He scooped up a handful of bright red buds from a basket and gave\nthem a deep sniff, beamed at the merchant as though he never smelled\nanything so fine.\n“Man of the people, eh?” muttered Tallow.\n“Very likeable,” said Vick. That’s what made him such a threat. She felt\nthe metal in her pocket knock against her stiff hip as she turned to follow\nhim. “But knives kill likeable men just as easily as unlikeable ones.”\n“Easier, if anything.” Tallow shrugged as she glanced around at him.\n“The likeable ones don’t tend to be watching for it.”\nA great sedan chair was heaved in front of them and Vick ducked under\nit, nearly knocking one of the carriers over and making the whole thing\nteeter, pushing on into a flood of people while the passenger screamed\nabuse after her.\nThere was a blood-curdling roar and Tallow jerked back from a cage,\nwould’ve fallen if Vick hadn’t caught him. There was a damn tiger inside.\nShe’d never seen one before, could hardly believe the size of it, the power\nof it, the weight of bright fur and muscle, twisting angrily with its huge\nteeth bared.\n“Bloody hell,” squeaked Tallow as Vick dragged him up by one wrist. It\nwas an animal market. A screeching, hooting, snarling menagerie.

She waved towards a rooftop. One of her hired men\nwas on a scaffold there, pretending to work at a crumbling chimney. He\ncaught her eye, nodded at an alley.\n“This way.” Vick swung towards it, making sure not to run.

Chanting echoed\nfrom up ahead, then a babble of raised voices, then they burst out onto an\nexpanse of worn paving.\nThe Great Temple of Westport rose up at one side, six tall turrets like the\nValbeck chimneys, but capped with golden spikes rather than plumes of\nsmoke.\nPlatforms were scattered in front. Stages where men and women stood\nin robes, in rags, festooned with talismans and beads or brandishing books\nand staffs. Wailing in broken voices to little crescents of curious onlookers,\ntearing at the air with their hands, pointing skywards with clawing fingers,\neyes popping with passion and certainty, promising salvation and\nthreatening damnation. Each insisting all the rest were frauds, and they\nalone were the one with all the answers.\nVick scorned them, pitied them, but underneath, well hidden, she envied\nthem, too. Wondered what it would be like, to believe in something that\nmuch. Enough to die for it. Like Sibalt had. Like Malmer had. Like her\nbrother had. How wonderful it must feel, to be certain. To know you stand\non the right side, instead of just the winning one. But you can’t just choose\nto believe, can you?\n“What the hell is this place?” muttered Tallow.\n“Another market,” said Vick, staring around for Shudra and his men.\n“What are they selling?”\n“God.”\nNow she saw him, gently nodding as he listened to one of the calmer\nprophets, his bodyguards distracted, unwary.\n“This is the place,” said Vick. Just crowded enough. Plenty of escape\nroutes. But so much confusion that a little more would hardly raise a brow.\nNot until it was far too late.\nShe started towards Shudra, not too fast, not too slow, not looking right\nat him, no one to remark upon, easing one hand into her pocket. She strode\npast a woman stripped to her waist on a platform, on her knees in front of a\ncrudely lettered sign, eyes brimming with ecstasy as she whipped herself,\nbare back a mass of new scratches and old scars.\n“Repent!” she was screeching with every crack of the whip. “Repent!”\nShe twisted around, raised a trembling finger. “Repent, sister!”\n“Later,” said Vick as she strode past.\nAnd now she saw the hooded figure. Just where she’d guessed he’d be.\nWalking towards Shudra, not too fast, not too slow, not looking right at him,\nno one to remark upon.\n“There,” she hissed.\n“He doesn’t look like much,” said Tallow.\n“He’d be a poor assassin if he stood out.” She cut sideways through the\ncrowd then around a platform where a blistered old man was yelling at the\nheavens.\nShe fell in behind the hooded figure, keeping pace as he slipped towards\nShudra. Hoods are good for hiding you from others, but they hide them\nfrom you, too. She eased her brass knuckles on, feeling the reassuring tickle\nof cold metal between her fingers."

She eased her brass knuckles on, feeling the reassuring tickle\nof cold metal between her fingers.\nShe saw the flash of steel as the hooded man pulled something from his\npocket, held it down beside his leg, half-hidden in the folds of his clothes.\nShe quickened her pace, closing on him as he closed on Shudra, heart\nthumping hard now and her breath coming fast as she thought out how\nshe’d do it.\nShudra clapped as the prophet finished his sermon, turned smiling to say\nsomething to one of his guards, caught sight of the hooded man coming,\nfrowned slightly.\nThe hooded man stepped towards him, lifting the blade.\nDoesn’t matter how skilled, or tough, or big a man is if he doesn’t see\nyou coming.\nVick caught his wrist as the knife went up and hauled it down, pulling\nhim backwards and punching him as hard as she could in the side of his\nknee.\nHe gave a shocked gasp as his leg went from under him. She twisted his\narm, knife clattering down, dragged him around as he fell and shoved him\non his face on the stones, her knee in the small of his back.\nShe hit him quick and hard, barking with each punch, in the kidney, in\nthe armpit, in the side of his neck, and he quivered, back arched, gave a\nbreathy wheeze then went limp.\n“Casamir dan Shenkt, I presume,” she forced through her gritted teeth.\nShe looked up at Shudra, who was staring down at her with wide eyes, his\nguards only now fumbling out their weapons. “No need to worry. You’re\nsafe.”\nHer hired men were shoving through the crowd, one of them snapping\nmanacles shut on the assassin’s wrists while the other dragged him groaning\nup under one arm.\n“But you might want to head home and bar the door,” she said as she\nstood, frowning into the crowd for any other threats. “Maybe stay off the\nstreets until the vote.”\n“You saved my life,” breathed Shudra. “Did the Styrians send you?”\nVick snorted. “The Union sent me.” She was pleased to see he looked\nmore shocked than ever as she nodded towards the assassin, swearing\nnoisily as her men dragged him away. “The Styrians sent him.”\nSafe Hands\n“Y\nour Majesty!” Wetterlant started forward, pressing his face to the bars.\nHe was a handsome man with a playful head of dark curls, but something\nmissing about the eyes. “Thank the Fates you’re here. They’ve been treating\nme like a dog!”\n“We’ve been treating you like a prisoner, Lord Wetterlant,” grated out\nGlokta as the Practical wheeled him to a halt and retreated into the\nshadows. Shadows were one thing of which there was no shortage down\nhere. “This is the House of Questions, not an inn. These are some of the\nbest quarters we have.”\n“You have a window.” High Justice Bruckel pointed through the bars at\nit. A tiny square of light, up near the ceiling. “He has a window!”\n“I barely get a window,” said Glokta."

A tiny square of light, up near the ceiling. “He has a window!”\n“I barely get a window,” said Glokta.\n“You dare to talk to me about windows, you crippled remnant?” snarled\nWetterlant. “Your Majesty, please, I know you are a reasonable man—”\n“I like to think so,” said Orso, stepping into the light. “I understand you\nhave requested the king’s justice. My justice,” he corrected. He would still\non occasion forget that he was the king, in spite of the phrase Your Majesty\nbeing flung at him five thousand times a day.\n“I have, Your Majesty! I fling myself upon your mercy! I am ill-used! I\nam falsely accused!”\n“Of the rape or the murder?”\nWetterlant blinked. “Well… of everything! I’m an innocent man.”\n“The murder, as I understand it, was witnessed by… how many,\nGlokta?”\n“Seventeen witnesses, Your Majesty. All sworn statements.”\n“Seventeen bloody peasants!” Wetterlant gripped the bars in a sudden\nfury. “You’d take their word over mine?”\n“Look at the number of them,” said Orso. “Your groundskeeper has\nalready been hanged on the strength of their testimony.”\n“It was all his idea, the bastard! I tried to talk him out of it. He\nthreatened me!”\nGlokta sucked air disgustedly through his empty gums. “We’ve only\nbeen here a minute and you’ve gone from innocent to coerced.”\n“Few moments more,” murmured the high justice, “he’ll be the victim.”\n“Can we speak alone?” Wetterlant’s voice was growing increasingly\nshrill. “Man to man, you know. Orso, please—”\n“We were never on first-name terms,” snapped Orso. “I can’t see us\ngetting there now, can you?”\nWetterlant looked from Glokta to Bruckel to Orso, and evidently found\nlittle cause for encouragement. “Things have got entirely out of hand. It was\nsimple high spirits.”\n“From innocence, to coercion, to high spirits,” said Glokta.\n“You understand, Your Majesty. You’ve embarrassed yourself often\nenough.”\nOrso stared at him. “Embarrassed myself, without doubt. But I never\nbloody raped anyone!” He found he had screamed the last words at the very\ntop of his voice. The high justice took a nervous step back. Glokta ever so\nslightly narrowed his eyes. Wetterlant blinked, and his lower lip began to\nwobble.\n“What will become of me?” he whispered, eyes suddenly brimming with\ntears. It was a strange about-face, from frothing outrage to melodramatic\nself-pity in a breath.\n“The traditional punishment,” pattered the high justice. “For such\ncrimes. Is hanging.”\n“I’m a member of the Open Council!”\n“You’ll find we all hang much the same,” said Glokta, softly.\n“You can’t hang a member of the Open Council!”\n“From innocence, to coercion, to high spirits, to immunity.” Orso leaned\ntowards the bars. “You demanded the king’s justice.

Orso gave the faintest shiver as he strode away, deeply\ngrateful to be on the right side of it.\n“Oh, hell,” hissed Bruckel. A formidable-looking woman, black hair\nstreaked with iron grey and her angular dress incorporating more than a hint\nof armoured steel, ploughed towards them with the determination of a\nwarship under full sail.\n“Who’s this?” muttered Orso.\n“The bastard’s mother,” grunted Glokta, from the corner of his mouth.\n“Oh, hell.”\n“Your Majesty.” Lady Wetterlant’s rigid curtsy bespoke barely contained\nfury.\n“Lady Wetterlant.” Orso had no idea of the right tone to strike and ended\nup trapped between a funeral guest and a boy caught stealing apples. “I…\ner… wish we were meeting under happier circumstances—”\n“You have the power to make them happier, Your Majesty. Do you plan\nto dismiss this ridiculous case?”\nHe was almost tempted, just to avoid this interview. “I… fear I cannot.\nThe evidence is compelling.”\n“The word of jealous commoners? My son is infamously used!\nSlandered by unscrupulous enemies. You would take their side?”\n“This is not a question of sides, madam, but of justice.”\n“You call this justice? He is imprisoned!”\n“He has,” said Bruckel, “a window.”\nLady Wetterlant turned a glare on the high justice that might have frozen\nmilk. “Mine is an old family, Your Majesty. We have many friends.”\nOrso winced as if into a gale. “A great comfort for you, and them, I am\nsure, but it does not bear upon the guilt or innocence of your son.”\n“It bears upon the consequences of the verdict. It bears upon them quite\nconsiderably. You have a child, Your Eminence.”\nGlokta’s left eye gave an ugly twitch. “Is that a threat?”\n“A humble entreaty,” though made in the very tone one might have used\nfor a threat. “I would ask you to look into your heart.”\n“Oh, mine’s a very small one. People who seek for anything of much\nsignificance in there are inevitably disappointed.”\nLady Wetterlant wrinkled her lip. “Be in no doubt, I will do everything\nin my considerable power to ensure my child goes free.”\n“Everything within the law,” squeaked Bruckel. “I trust.”\nLady Wetterlant eased towards him. “A mother’s love for her child\ntranscends the law.”\n“Don’t count on it.” Glokta jerked his head at the Practical wheeling his\nchair, who shoved it forward with sufficient violence to run Lady Wetterlant\ndown, had she not stumbled aside. Orso seized the opportunity to hurry past\nin his wake."

Orso seized the opportunity to hurry past\nin his wake.\n“Do the right thing, Your Majesty!” Lady Wetterlant shrieked after him,\nher voice so sharp it made him hunch his shoulders. “I beg you, for my\nsake. For your sake. Do the right thing!”\n“I intend to,” muttered Orso. But he doubted he and Lady Wetterlant\nmeant the same by that particular phrase. No one does. That’s the problem\nwith it.\nThe First of the Magi was standing in the gardens when Orso returned,\namong well-manicured beds in which the first blooms were just peeping\nfrom their buds, frowning towards the House of the Maker, its stark outline\nshowing over the battlements of the creeper-covered palace wall.\n“Lord Bayaz.” Orso’s greeting came out with more than a dash of\nresentment. “Still with us?”\n“Your Majesty.” The First of the Magi smiled as he bowed, but his green\neyes stayed hard. “I will soon be taking my leave, in fact.”\n“Oh? Oh.” Orso had been desperate to get rid of the old meddler, but\nnow it came to it, he found he was sorry to see him go. Perhaps he wanted\nsomeone to blame. Now, as usual, he would have to blame himself.\n“I had not intended to stay so long but, with your father’s death, I\nwanted to see the crown… smoothly transferred.”\n“Chaos in Westport, chaos in Valbeck, chaos among the commoners,\nchaos among the nobility?” Orso gave a sorry grunt. “Things could be\nsmoother.”\n“Your father and I passed through rougher seas together.” Bayaz took a\nlong breath through his nose, winced and cleared his throat. The air was\nalways bad when the wind blew from the west, sharp with smoke from the\nchimneys that towered ever higher over the Three Farms and the Arches.\n“Times change.” And Bayaz began to stroll through the gardens, giving\nOrso no choice but to scrape after him, the paths a shade too narrow to walk\nabreast, leaving him feeling more like a butler than a king. “I am pleased to\nhave played my part in ushering in the new age but… I confess I feel like\nsomething of a relic in Adua. And there are other issues that demand my\nattention. I judge the Union to be in safe hands.”\n“What, mine?”\nBayaz spared him a glance. “Let us say safe enough. What was your\nopinion of Fedor dan Wetterlant?”\nOrso gave an explosive snort. “Guilty as the plague and an utter shit to\nboot. I’m not sure I ever in my life met so loathsome a man.”\n“Your Majesty has been fortunate in his acquaintance,” said Bayaz, feet\ncrunching in the perfect gravel. “I have known many of his type.”\n“He’s like the villain in some tawdry play.”\n“I must confess I have always had some sympathy with villains.\nHeroism makes fine entertainment but sooner or later someone has to get\nthings done.”\n“Well-written villains, maybe. You wouldn’t believe Wetterlant in a\nbook! How the hell does a man end up like that?”"

How the hell does a man end up like that?”\n“Being given everything he wants all his life. Being asked for nothing in\nreturn.”\nOrso frowned. He could have said much the same about himself. “It\nstings me that we must waste so much effort on so worthless a man. The\nBreakers, in Valbeck—”\n“Traitors, Your Majesty.”\n“But at least they had reasons. At least they thought they were doing\nright. What the hell can Wetterlant’s excuse be? He doesn’t even bother to\nmake one. He doesn’t even see the need to make one. I bloody hate\nhangings, but a man like that presents a sore temptation. I just wish we\ncould find our way to some compromise.”\n“You are welcome to try, of course.”\n“Am I?”\n“Each generation must make its own choices.” Bayaz stopped, smiling\ndown at a perfect white flower, the first in the garden to fully show its face\nto the spring sun. “If all we do is stick to what we know, how can we make\nprogress?”\n“You couldn’t solve it all with…” Orso waved feebly towards the House\nof the Maker. “A spell, or something?”\n“Magic fades from the world. I destroyed the Prophet’s indestructible\nHundred Words. Those few of his Eaters that remain skulk about the South,\ntrying to hold together the shreds of their ruined empire. A man is measured\nby his enemies. Worthy ones can be more missed than friends.” Bayaz gave\na sigh, then a shrug. “Magic fades from the world but, in truth, most\nproblems have always been better solved with a few sharp words. Or a little\nsharp steel.”\n“So I must be a rock, eh?”\n“As your father always tried to be.”\nOrso felt a pang of sadness at that. “I used to think he could do whatever\nhe pleased, and chose to do nothing out of fear, or weakness, or\nincompetence. Now I see he was dragged in so many different directions at\nonce that it took all his energies to stand still.”\n“It is not an easy role to fill.” Bayaz reached out to touch that flower\nwith his fingertip, ever so gently brushing a few specks of glittering dew\nfrom its petals. “Living kings are always objects of derision. But people\ncannot wait to worship the dead ones. Someone must lead. Someone must\nmake the hard choices. For everyone’s benefit.”\n“I somehow doubt they’ll thank me for it,” muttered Orso.\nBayaz showed his teeth for an instant as he nipped that bloom off with\nhis thumbnail and slipped the stalk through his buttonhole. “Thanks would\nbe too much to ask.”\n“Lord Isher, thank you for coming.”\n“Of course, Your Majesty, the moment I received the message.”\nOrso had an urge to ask Isher what army his overblown uniform\nbelonged to, as he’d certainly never served with the Union one.

When it came to impostors, he\nwas surely the worst in the whole Circle of the World, so he smiled wide\nand resisted the temptation to make himself a hypocrite into the bargain. He\nwas getting better at resisting temptations, all in all. Or so he told himself.\n“An astonishing room,” murmured Isher, suitably awestruck as he gazed\nup at the ceiling, carved in the minutest detail as a forest canopy, gold and\nsilver clockwork birds dotted among the branches. They had sung, once,\nwhen fully wound, though the mechanism had failed long ago. It was,\nwithout a doubt, impressive, which was why Orso had picked it for this\ninterview. He could not escape the thought, however, that whatever\nmonarch constructed the place could simply have frolicked in one of the\ndozens of real forests he owned and put several hundred thousand marks\ninto paying off his debts.\n“They call it the Chamber of Leaves,” he said. “For obvious reasons.”\n“I had no idea it existed.”\n“There are probably a dozen rooms just as grand in the palace that I\nhave no idea exist, and I’m supposed to own the place.” Orso thought about\nhow that sounded as he gestured Isher to a chair. “Or… at least be its\ncustodian, for a generation. There’s a hall in the east wing so big my mother\nused to ride in there. She even had it turfed at one point.”\n“Your Majesty, might I extend my condolences on the death of your\nfather. I have not had the chance to do so personally and—though I confess\nwe had our differences—he was a man I always very much admired.”\n“Thank you, Lord Isher. And might I offer my congratulations on your\nforthcoming wedding. We have had too few happy events to look forward\nto, of late.”\n“Difficult times, Your Majesty. Nothing for me.” As a well-powdered\nfootman leaned towards him, silver tray expertly balanced on his fingertips.\n“Nor me.” Orso waved the man away and shuffled to the edge of his\nchair. “In my youth I loved to dance, but since taking the crown I prefer to\nget straight to the matter. I wish to speak to you, man to man, on the subject\nof Fedor dan Wetterlant.”\n“A terrible business.” Isher grimly shook his head. “And one that has the\nprospect of doing serious harm. Discord between the Closed Council and\nthe Open is like discord between a man and his wife—”\n“It has not been the happiest of marriages in recent years, then,”\nobserved Orso, thinking of his father’s grinding teeth during their fencing\nsessions.\nIsher only smiled. “The Open Council can be a somewhat shrewish\nbride, I confess.”\n“And the Closed Council a domineering and neglectful husband. No one\nknows that better than I, believe me.”\n“Older men on both sides have, perhaps, become entrenched in their\npositions. Sometimes it takes younger men to find new ways forward.”\nOrso nodded along. “Honestly, my advisors feel the nation’s interests\nwould be best served if a trial were never to happen.

If Wetterlant were to\nrot away in the empty ground between innocence and guilt.”\n“It is a solution that makes sense from their perspective, but… if I\nmay?” Orso waved him on. “It would satisfy no one. Wetterlant would\ncontinue to bleat for justice from his cell, and his friends in the Open\nCouncil would bleat on his behalf, and his mother would be a continual\nthorn in everyone’s side—”\n“Doubtless.”\n“—while the common folk would see no justice done and harbour\nfurther resentment. And then… I hope you will not think me naïve, but\nthere is a moral question. It would be a victory of expediency over\nprinciple.”\n“We have had far too many of those.” This was going better than Orso\nhad dared hope. “You speak my very thoughts!”\n“With your permission, Your Majesty, might I suggest a compromise?”\n“You think you can find one?” Orso had expected to coax or threaten or\nbarter his way to it, and here Isher was offering it up as a gift.\n“I took the liberty of speaking to Lords Heugen and Barezin. Influential\nold allies of mine. And my friend Leonault dan Brock will soon be arriving\nin the city. He is new to politics but tremendously popular.”\n“Mmm,” murmured Orso. The Young Lion’s tremendous popularity was\nsomething he could hear less about, overall.\n“I believe, with their help… I could get broad support in the Open\nCouncil for a lengthy prison sentence.”\n“Wetterlant committed rape and murder.”\n“That is the accusation.”\n“He scarcely even bloody denies it himself!”\n“When I say lengthy… I mean without end.”\nOrso raised his brows. “The Open Council would countenance a life\nsentence for one of their own?”\n“Most of them are every bit as disgusted at his behaviour as we are,\nYour Majesty. They are keen to see justice done.”\n“His mother most decidedly is not.”\n“I know Lady Wetterlant well, and this bluster is merely the tigress’s\ndesperate defence of her cub. She is fierce, but no fool. I believe when she\nrealises the alternative… she will help me secure an admission of guilt.”\n“A confession?”\n“A full and contrite confession with no need for the Arch Lector’s…\nintervention. The trial could be a formality. A demonstration of your justice\ndone, firmly but fairly. Of your power exercised, without delay or dispute.\nOf a new spirit of cooperation between the Open Council and the Closed.”\n“Well, that would be a fine thing.” It might have been the first time Orso\nhad enjoyed discussing official business. “It’s supposed to be a damn\nUnion, isn’t it? We should strive to find our way to common ground.\nPerhaps some good can come of this after all.” Orso sat back, grinning up at\nthe gilded birds as he considered it. “I certainly do hate hangings.”\nIsher smiled. “What kind of monster enjoys them, Your Majesty?”\nAn Ambush\nS\nqueak, squeak, squeak, went the wheel of her father’s chair.

Gritted her teeth at it. Struggled with every turn of\nthat wheel not to scream.\nShe had been walking her father to work, then wheeling him to work,\nonce a month since she was a girl. The same route down the Kingsway,\nbetween the statues of Harod and Bayaz that began the frowning parade of\nthe Union’s heroes. The same conversation, like a fencing match in which\nyou were never sure whether the steels were blunted. The same laughing at\nthe misfortunes of others. She saw no reason to change her habits simply\nbecause her life was falling apart around her, so she mimed the old routines.\nStill walking, like a ghost through the ruins of the house she died in. Still\nwriggling, like a snake with its head cut off. Not laughing at misfortunes so\nmuch, mind you. One’s own bad luck is so much less amusing than other\npeople’s.\n“Something on your mind?” asked her father. Though he wasn’t really\nher father, of course.\n“Nothing much,” she lied. Just a string of failing investments, a network\nof souring acquaintances, a calamitous love affair with her own brother, the\nruin of all her dearest ambitions, a constant feeling of nagging horror, an\naching chest, occasional waves of weariness, a near-constant need to spew,\nand the minor detail that she was a bastard carrying a bastard who had\nbecome a terrified impostor in her own life. Other than that, all good.\nSqueak, squeak, fucking squeak. Why the hell had she ever asked\nCurnsbick to build this shrieking contraption?\n“How’s business?”\nEver more disastrous. “Good,” she lied as she pushed the chair through\nthe giant shadow of Arnault the Just. “If they keep digging at this rate, the\ncanal will be completed within the month.”\n“You let Kort off with a warning? I thought you might have had him\nskinned as an example to your other partners.”\n“Skinned men generate no revenue. And Zuri says forgiveness is\nneighbour to the divine.”\n“She has you quoting scripture now? Is she your companion, or are you\nhers?”\n“She’s my friend,” said Savine. The only one she trusted. “Introducing\nus may be the best thing you have ever done for me.”\n“We all need someone we can rely on.”\n“Even you?”\n“Please. I can’t get out of bed without your mother’s help.”\nSavine ground her teeth. What she really wanted was to wheel her father\noff a bridge and stop somewhere for another sniff of pearl dust, even though\nher face was still numb from the last one. But the parapets on the bridges\nwere too high, and there was nowhere private to snort on the Kingsway, so\nfor the time being the torture would have to continue. It was what her father\nwas known for, after all. Truly, as he loved to say, life is the misery we\nendure between disappointments. She wheeled him on, between the\nmagnificent sculptures of Casamir the Steadfast and his Arch Lector, Zoller."

Neither of them lives anywhere near\nme.”\nThe scaffolding was coming down from the final statue before the\nshimmering greenery of the park. The king most recently deceased. Jezal\nthe First, that personification of vaguely well-meaning indecision, rendered\ngrimly commanding by the royal sculptors. The sight of his face made\nSavine more nauseous than ever. Her uncle, Lord Marshal West, stood\nopposite, with a hint of her mother in a mood about his frown as he glared\noff towards the sea, as though he saw the Gurkish fleet there and would sink\nthem with pure force of dislike. Beside him Bayaz towered again, a statue\nvery much like the one at the other end of the Kingsway. Seven hundred\nyears of Union history, topped and tailed by the same bald bastard.\n“A charming picture!” A sturdy man in a superbly tailored coat was\nblocking their path. Bayaz himself, Savine realised, sun gleaming from his\nhairless pate, looking less like a legendary wizard than a highly prosperous\nmerchant. “My own brothers and sisters are forever feuding. It warms my\nheart to see a father and daughter enjoying each other’s company.”\nOr, indeed, a torturer and an unrelated woman barely speaking to one\nanother.\n“Lord Bayaz.” Savine’s father sounded distinctly uncomfortable. “I\nthought you were returning to the North.”\n“Interrupted on my way to the docks by these new statues.” And he\nwaved up towards King Jezal. “I knew all the men in question and wished\nto make sure their likenesses were faithful to the facts. I am supposed to be\nretired, but as an owner of businesses, I am sure you know, Lady Savine, it\nis nigh impossible to find people who can manage things properly in one’s\nabsence.”\n“Good budgeting is key,” said Savine, stiffly. “When Angland needed\nhelp the treasury was empty. Yet we can afford statues.”\n“I need not lecture you on the importance of investing wisely. A bright\nfuture rests on a proper respect for the past. The seeds of the past bear fruit\nin the present, eh, Your Eminence?”\n“In my experience, they never stop blooming.” Her father reached\naround to put his hand on Savine’s. “We should not take up too much of\nyour time—”\n“I always have time to meet the leading lights of the new generation.\nThe future belongs to them, after all.”\n“Even if we must tear it from the grip of the old,” said Savine, twisting\nher wrist free of her father’s hand.\n“Very little worth anything is ever given away.

The one in the chair, not the one\nimmortalised in stone. “I have no doubt your father will stand here one day.\nWho has sacrificed more for the Union, after all? Except perhaps your\nuncle.” Bayaz turned to look up at the statue of Lord Marshal West. “Who\ngave his life defending it.”\n“I thought we were being faithful to the facts?” Savine was in no mood\nto flatter this old fool. “I understand he survived the Gurkish attack but died\nof the sickness you released when you destroyed half the Agriont.”\n“Well.” Bayaz’s good humour did not so much as flicker. “If this row of\nstatues tells us anything, it is that there are many ways to tell the same\nstory.”\n“Clearly,” said Savine, glancing from the real First of the Magi, shorter\nthan she was with her boots on, to his colossal statue.\n“Savine,” murmured her father, a warning note in his voice.\n“Such a spirited young woman.” Bayaz gave her the kind of look she\nmight have given the men of the Solar Society, wondering which was\nworthy of investment. “The Union will need someone with good sense and\na strong stomach to take charge one day. One day soon, perhaps. Someone\nwho does not flinch from what must be said. What must be done. The\nBreakers and Burners must be dealt with.” The first hint of real anger in his\nvoice, and for some reason it made Savine flinch. “You were in Valbeck. Do\nyou know the first thing they broke and burned there?”\nShe swallowed a wave of sickness. Calm, calm, calm. “I—”\n“The Banking House of Valint and Balk! An attack on enterprise. On\nprogress. On the very future! If the current administration cannot get a grip\non the situation… we must find someone who can.”\n“I hope to serve the Crown for many years to come,” grated her father.\n“King Orso will need just as much guidance as his father did.”\n“Guidance does not have to be given in the White Chamber. It can come\nin theatre foyers, or comfortable living rooms, or even, who knows, in\nwriters’ offices.” That choice of words could hardly be an accident. Savine\nfelt the heat spreading up her collar. Bayaz smiled at her, but it did not get\nas far as his eyes. “We should have a talk some day, you and I. About what I\nwant. And about what you want. Who knows? You might be the first\nwoman to be immortalised on the Kingsway! As the only person with two\nstatues here, you can take my word for it—when it’s you they’re sculpting,\nit all starts to seem like an excellent use of funds.”\nSavine was not often lost for words, but she hardly knew how to reply.\n“I had no idea you picked the leaders of the Union.”\nBayaz only smiled wider. “Recognising one’s own ignorance is the first\nstep towards enlightenment. Lady Savine. Your Eminence.” He gave them a\nbrief nod and strode off jauntily down the Kingsway, the tails of his\nexpensive coat flicking behind him."

        "text": "step towards enlightenment. Lady Savine. Your Eminence.” He gave them a\nbrief nod and strode off jauntily down the Kingsway, the tails of his\nexpensive coat flicking behind him.\nSavine’s heart pounded as she watched him go. As if she had parried a\nfew thrusts to the heart, rather than replied to a few strange remarks. She\nused to be razor-sensitive to the subtext of every conversation. The dangers\nlurking beneath the surface, like rocks to the unwary vessel. But she hardly\ntrusted her own instincts any more.\n“What exactly was he offering me?” she muttered.\nHer father gave a bitter snort. “The First of the Magi never gives, only\ntakes. That was not an offer to you, it was a threat to me.”\n“Threats, and blackmail, and banks?” It was one of those moments when\nyou realise the world may not be quite what you had thought it was. She\nhad been experiencing a lot of those lately. “What kind of wizard is he?”\nHer father frowned up at Bayaz’s towering statue. “The kind you obey.”\n“I’ve been made some outrageous proposals,” Savine threw over her\nshoulder to Zuri as she pulled off her gloves, “but that must be the first time\na statue on the Kingsway has been put on the table…”\nShe became aware of the muffled burble of conversation from the door\nto her mother’s parlour. Odd, that she should have a visitor so early. It\nusually took something special to get her out of her bedroom before lunch.\nZuri had her black brows significantly raised. “I believe Lady Ardee\nmight have an outrageous offer of her own to put to you.”\n“My mother and I are not on the best of terms at the moment.”\n“I realise. But the scriptures say those lost in the desert should take such\nwater as they are offered.” She gently swung open the door. “No matter\nwho it comes from.”\nHer mother’s voice spilled out as Savine stepped suspiciously into the\nroom. “… my husband might as well be dead, as far as that department\ngoes, and then— Savine, you’re here!” She smiled over from the cabinet\nwhere she was, it hardly needed to be said, pouring herself a glass of wine.\n“We’ve a visitor.” Another woman was rising from a chair, something of a\nmilitary cut to clothes mud-spotted about the hem from riding. “This is\nLady Finree dan Brock.”\nSavine prided herself on being hard to rattle, but Leo dan Brock’s\nmother in her own mother’s parlour was not an easy thing to write off as\ncoincidence. Especially when she was currently carrying the woman’s\ngrandchild.\n“Savine.” Lady Finree took her hand in both of hers, and a fearsomely\nfirm grip it was, too. “I’ve heard so much about you.”\n“All good, I hope.”\n“Mostly.” Finree dan Brock had an unflinching stare that even Savine\nfound slightly intimidating. “But a woman who produced only good reports\nwould not be fighting hard enough. I am a great admirer of your\nachievements as a lady of business.”\nSavine assumed her sweetest smile while she tried to work out what was\ngoing on. “As I am a great admirer of yours as a Lady Governor.”"

What brings you to Adua?”\n“An invitation to Lord Isher’s wedding.”\n“It’ll be the event of the season,” said Savine’s mother, “though if you’re\nasking me, the man’s a bloody viper. Wine, Savine?”\nThe conversation with Bayaz had felt somehow dangerous. This felt\neven more so. Savine had a sense she would need her wits intact. “Not for\nme.”\n“Lady Finree?”\n“No, but don’t let me stop you.”\n“You won’t stop mother drinking unless you brought a few fathoms of\nchain with you.”\nSavine’s mother plopped herself down on a chair, making a perfect\ntriangle of the three of them, wiped a streak of wine from the side of her\nglass and sucked her fingertip. “You’re salty this morning.”\n“I don’t care for the feeling of being ambushed,” said Savine, looking\nfrom one woman to the other, both formidable in their own ways and as a\npair positively daunting.\nThey exchanged a glance. “You go,” said her mother. “I’ll chime in if\nneeded.”\n“My son has inherited a weighty responsibility,” said Lady Finree. “One\nthat he is in some respects well suited for, but in others… less so.”\nSavine could well imagine. “He’s hotheaded, ignorant and reckless, you\nmean?”\n“Exactly.” Savine should not have been surprised. A woman who had\nfaced down an army of screaming Northmen was unlikely to be put off by a\nlittle plain-speaking. “You, meanwhile, are known to be cool-headed,\ncalculating and patient. It seems the two of you are complementary.”\n“Fire and ice!” threw in Savine’s mother between sips.\n“My son likes to think he can do it all but, like his father, he has always\nneeded someone beside him. Someone to give good advice and make sure\nhe takes it. Someone to guide him to the right decisions. There comes a time\nwhen a mother can no longer do that for a son.” She raised her brows\nexpectantly.\nSavine did not like the way this was going. “I’m not sure what I—”\nHer mother gave an explosive sigh. “Don’t be obtuse, Savine. Lady\nFinree and I have been discussing a match between you and Leo.”\nSavine blinked. “A marriage?”\n“Well, not a bloody fencing match.”\nSavine stared from her mother to her prospective mother-in-law. It was\nan ambush. An expertly prepared pincer movement, and she was outflanked\non both sides.\nShe lifted her chin and played for time. “I’m not sure the two of us are\nsuited. He is a good deal younger than—”\n“I understand you felt differently when he last visited Adua,” said Lady\nFinree, looking at her significantly from under her brows."

He is a good deal younger than—”\n“I understand you felt differently when he last visited Adua,” said Lady\nFinree, looking at her significantly from under her brows.\nIt took a moment for the implications to sink in. “He told you that?”\nSavine’s mother raised a hand. “I told her that.”\n“How the hell did you find out?”\n“Don’t be cross and don’t be coy. Neither suits you. Zuri is worried for\nyou, as a good servant should be. As a good friend should be. She is\nthinking of your best interests. We all are, believe it or not.” Her mother\nleaned forward, holding her eye, and put a reassuring hand on Savine’s\nknee. “She told us about your… situation.”\nSavine’s face burned. She found she had put a hand to her stomach and\nangrily snatched it away. She was used to stabbing other people with their\nsecrets. She did not at all enjoy being impaled on one of her own.\n“Forgive me if I am blunt,” said Lady Finree. “I have spent much of my\nlife around soldiers—”\n“Fancy that,” snapped Savine. “So did mother, in her youth.”\n“It’s a shame youth has to end,” sang Savine’s mother, fluttering her\neyelashes. Then she gave Savine’s knee a parting pat and sat back,\nmurmuring out of the corner of her mouth, “You see that bluntness won’t be\na problem.”\n“Then let us speak plainly,” said Lady Finree. “It will not be long before\nyour condition becomes difficult to hide.” Savine angrily set her jaw, but\nshe could hardly dispute the facts. The laces of her corsets already needed\neven more brutal handling than usual. “It could be a disaster for you. Or it\ncould be an opportunity. Turning disasters into opportunities is what an\ninvestor does, isn’t it?”\n“Wherever possible,” muttered Savine.\n“My son has title, fame, courage and loyalty.”\n“And is a damnably handsome fellow,” observed Savine’s mother.\n“You have wealth, connections, cunning and ruthlessness.”\n“And in the right light can look rather well yourself.”\n“I doubt there is a more eligible young man in the Union,” said Lady\nFinree. “Unless you were to marry the king, I suppose.”\nSavine’s mother coughed wine down her dress. “Damn it. Silly me.”\n“Your pride is well earned,” said Finree, “but the time has come to put it\naside.”\nHer mother was dabbing at herself with a handkerchief. “Really. You\ncould be the most envied couple in the Union! You’re far too clever not to\nsee the sense of this.”\n“And certainly far too clever to raise a bastard alone when you have\nsuch an advantageous alternative. By all means lead my son a little dance if\nyou please, no man values what he gets too easily. But there really is no\nneed to drag this charade out any further between the three of us.”\nSavine slowly sat back. There had been a golden moment when her\nfingertips had brushed the crown.

But, she had to admit, Her Grace the Lady Governor\nof Angland was not a bad second best. She had tried following her heart,\nand it had led her straight to shit. She and Leo dan Brock were an excellent\nmatch in every way that counted. He would need some moulding, some\nsteering, some discipline. But who could argue with the quality of the raw\nmaterials? A wedding to a famous hero might be the very thing to turn her\nfortunes around.\nSavine had spent her whole life scheming, plotting, striving to control\nevents. There was a certain relief in yielding to the inevitable. “No,” she\nsaid, almost a sigh. “I don’t suppose there is.”\nShe had been made many proposals of marriage, but this was the first\nshe had actually accepted. And the only one made not by the prospective\nhusband, but by his mother.\n“I think I’ll take that drink now,” she said.\n“I, too.” Lady Finree issued a neat little smile. “Since we’ve something\nto celebrate.”\nSavine’s mother grinned as she trotted to the cabinet.\nGentle Temperaments\nT\nhe Lords’ Round was an awe-inspiring space, all marble and gilding and\nfriezes of noble forebears. Heart of the Union and all that, light streaming\nfrom the stained-glass windows, through the echoing vastness, to splash the\ntiled floor where the great noblemen of the past once set the course of the\nfuture.\nBut all Leo saw were the steps down through the empty banks of\nseating.\nBefore his duel and the damn leg wound, he’d never noticed how many\nsteps there were in the world. He’d sprung up them three at a time and gone\nblithely on his way. No more. They were everywhere. And down was worse\nthan up, that was the thing people never realised. Going up, you couldn’t\nfall that far. He took the usual moment to curse the Circle, swords and Stour\nNightfall, then set off slightly sideways, grumbling with each lurching\nstride.\n“Leo!” Isher ignored the offered hand at the bottom of the steps and\ninstead folded him in a hug. “Wonderful to see you again!” A bit\noverfamiliar given they’d spoken no more than three times, but better too\nfriendly than the opposite.\n“Congratulations on your forthcoming marriage.” Leo winced at a\ntwinge in his leg as he broke free. “Haven’t seen my mother this excited in\nyears.” He turned slowly around, looking up towards the gilded dome high,\nhigh above. “Doubt you could find a grander venue.”\n“Nor a bride with better pedigree.” Isher stroked at the air as though\nthey were discussing a racehorse. “Isold dan Kaspa, do you know her?”\n“Don’t think I’ve had the pleasure.”\n“Excellent blood. Good old Midderland stock. Wonderfully gentle\ntemperament.”\n“Wonderful,” said Leo, without much joy. To him, a woman with a\ngentle temperament was like a sword without an edge.\nIsher frowned down at Leo’s cane. “How’s your leg?”"

Sword wounds.” As though Isher knew a damn thing about\nswords or wounds. He leaned close. “Things have not been going well since\nyour last visit.”\n“No?”\n“I hate to be unpatriotic,” he murmured, as if he could hardly wait, “but\nKing Orso proves to be every bit the empty vessel we were expecting.”\n“There’s nothing unpatriotic about the truth,” muttered Leo, wondering\nwhether there might be.\n“He offers not the slightest check to Old Sticks and the rest of those\nwithered bastards on the Closed Council. It’s all liars and swindlers in the\nWhite Chamber.”\n“Always has been,” muttered Leo, wondering if it had been.\n“They’re set on limiting the powers of the Open Council. Stripping us of\nancient rights. Clawing land back to the Crown. Taxing us to the bloody\nballs.”\n“Huh,” grunted Leo. “I feel your pain there. Angland’s being squeezed\nhardest of all.”\n“And if anyone’s earned some clemency, it’s you, who held back the\nsavages alone, with no help from the Crown!”\n“We fought the king’s war. We won the king’s war! We paid for the\nfucking…” Leo brought his voice back down, with some difficulty, “…\nking’s war. And what did we get back?” He slapped angrily at the lion-head\npommel of the commemorative sword he’d so proudly accepted from King\nJezal last year. “One sword. And it’s not even properly bloody balanced!”\n“It’s a scandal.”\n“It is a scandal.” Leo wondered whether he was saying too much but\ncouldn’t help himself. “A breach of the contract between the Crown and the\nprovinces. There are folk back home asking if we’re subjects or livestock.”\nJurand had told him to be careful what he said in Adua, but Jurand was a\nlong way away, sadly, and the truth was the truth. “There are folk on the\nverge of bloody rebellion,” he hissed, grinding the end of his cane into the\ntiles.\n“A bloody scandal,” lamented Isher. “Still. Nothing compared to what\nthey’re doing to poor Fedor dan Wetterlant.”\n“Who?”\n“You never met?”\n“Don’t think I’ve had the pleasure…”\n“One of us, Wetterlant. Seat on the Open Council, estates down near\nKeln. Good old Midderland stock, you know.”\n“Gentle temperament?”\n“Little wild, truth be told, but we’ve known each other for years. I\nbelieve he’s a fourth cousin of mine or some such. Once removed, maybe?”\n“Never really understood how all that once removed stuff works…”\n“Who does? The charges are trumped up, without a doubt.

He has no idea what’s done in his\nname and wouldn’t do a thing about it if he did. They’ve got Wetterlant\nlocked up in the bowels of the House of Questions, away from friends,\naway from family. Not even a window! His poor mother is beside herself.\nCousin of a cousin as well, it’s taken quite the toll.”\n“By the dead,” murmured Leo, then realised it was a Northern saying\nand meant nothing here.\n“He’s appealed for the king’s justice. Anyone with a seat on the Open\nCouncil has the right to a trial here with His Majesty as the judge but,\nwell… I doubt there’s any justice to be had in the Union these days.”\n“By the dead! I mean, bloody hell.”\n“Even members of the old families, even members of the Open Council,\neven patriots like you or I aren’t safe. It hardly feels like our country any\nmore.”\nLeo rubbed at his thigh, the simmering pain a spur to his simmering\nanger. “Someone should do something,” he growled.\n“Someone should.” Isher nodded sadly. “But… who has the courage?”\nLeo tried not to limp as he walked back down the Kingsway, past the\nstatues of the great men of history. Kings loomed on one side. Real kings.\nHarod the Great. Arnault the Just. Casamir the Steadfast. Great figures from\ntheir reigns loomed a little lower on the other.\nLeo wondered if a statue of him would stand here one day. Holding\nsword and shield in recognition of great victories, gazing sternly across the\nroadway to a taller and more impressive statue of King Orso. That thought\nhardly filled him with joy. He was paying for his glories with every step and\ndidn’t fancy sharing with a man he was losing all respect for.\nCrown Prince Orso had struck him as a good enough sort, but the throne\nonly amplifies a man’s bad qualities, and his Closed Council were the same\ncorrupt old worms who’d driven King Jezal’s reign into the ditch. What the\nUnion needed was men of courage, men of passion, men of action.\nMen like him.\nThe quarters he and his mother had been given were high up, blessed\nwith views but cursed with steps. When he finally got to the top, his leg was\non fire. He had to pause to settle his breath, mop away sweat and force his\ngrimace into a carefree smile. He told himself he didn’t want his mother to\nworry. In truth, he didn’t want to prove her right.\n“How was your meeting with Lord Isher?” she asked as he strode in.\n“Well enough. He’d a bastard of a story about this poor fellow\nWetterlant. There’s a rot in the Agriont, but no one’s got the courage to…”\nThere was someone behind him.

She struck me as a very\nattractive…” Terrible choice of word! “I mean… formidable woman.”\n“Please, you’re embarrassing me. And certainly yourself.” Lady Ardee\nlaid a familiar hand on his arm. Everyone in Adua was too familiar. “I’m\nsorry to put you in a corner but I know the two of you were intimate.” She\nnodded towards Leo’s mother. “We both do.”\n“You… do? Oh. Oh.” Damn, he sounded lame. He was a Lord\nGovernor, wasn’t he? Not some stuttering schoolboy. “I assure you I\ndidn’t… take advantage of her… in any sense—”\nLady Ardee laughed. “The man isn’t made who could take advantage of\nmy daughter. I’ve no doubt it was quite the other way around.”\n“What?” He wasn’t sure whether that was better or worse, only that he\nwanted this conversation to end, but his mother had blocked the doorway.\nThere was no escape.\n“You know how much I love you, Leo,” she said. “You’re a wonderful\nleader. Brave, honest, loyal to a fault. I could not be more proud. I have the\nYoung Lion for a son!”\n“Rawrrrr,” said Lady Ardee, grinning at him sidelong.\n“But lions are not suited to administration. I know you want to do it all,\nbut the last few months have proved to us both that you cannot govern\nAngland on your own.”\n“You are the head of a great family,” said Lady Ardee, “and great\nfamilies must be sustained. You may want to do it all, but I very much\ndoubt you’ll be bearing any heirs yourself. You need a wife.”\nHe struggled to put the parts of this conversation together but could only\nsee one way to do it. “You want me… to marry… your daughter?” The\nwhole thing had an air of unreality.\n“Whyever not? She’s a beautiful, wealthy, refined, intelligent,\nimpeccably connected and widely admired lady of taste.”\nLeo’s mother nodded along. “I was most impressed with her.”\n“You’ve met her?” asked Leo. “I feel a bit… ambushed.”\n“A famous warrior?

You are a great lord of the\nrealm. When did you expect to marry?”\n“Not next bloody week!”\n“We realise it’s a lot to take in,” said Lady Ardee, “but delay serves\nnobody’s interests. Regardless of who took advantage of whom, you have\nplaced my daughter in a difficult position.”\n“She is pregnant,” chimed in his mother, “with your bastard.”\nLeo opened his mouth but only a choked-off gurgle came out. “But…\nhow…”\nLady Ardee rolled her eyes. “I’d hoped you’d be versed in the basics\nbut, if we must. Have you ever noticed that girls and boys have different\nthings between their legs?”\n“I know where babies come from!”\n“Then you appreciate the responsibilities that emerge with them.” Lady\nArdee took a nip from a flask she’d produced as if by magic, then offered it\naround. “Drink?”\n“Reckon I’d better,” he said numbly, taking a little swig. It proved to be\na very good brandy. He stared off hopelessly into the corner as its warmth\nspread down his throat. He’d known real adulthood was advancing on him,\nbut he’d assumed it was still some way off. Now it had fallen from a great\nheight and squashed him flat. “Can I at least ask her myself?”\n“Of course.” His mother stepped aside and gestured towards the tall\nwindows.\n“Wait…” Leo felt a new stab of nerves. “She’s here?”\n“On the terrace,” said Lady Ardee. “Waiting for your proposal.”\n“I don’t even have a—”\nHis mother was holding a ring out, blue stone glinting in the sunlight.\n“The one your father gave me.” She took his wrist, turned his hand over and\ndropped it into his palm while Lady Ardee nudged the window open with\nher boot-heel, a cool breeze washing in from the terrace and stirring the\ncurtains."

He closed his fist tight around the ring, drained the flask and handed\nit to Lady Ardee. “My thanks.”\n“My honour.” She plucked a speck of dust from his jacket and gave his\nchest an approving pat. “We’ll be here if you get into trouble.”\n“What a comfort,” he murmured as he stepped out into the sunlight.\nSavine stood at the parapet, the Agriont spread out below her as if she\nowned it. Somehow, he’d expected her to have turned matronly, rosy-\ncheeked, bloated out with child. But she was every bit as sleek and dignified\nas the day they met. Not rattled by the long drop beyond the short parapet at\nher back, or their whirlwind courtship, or her delicate condition. Apparently\nimpossible to rattle at all. His first thought was what a portrait they’d make\ntogether.\nShe sank into a curtsy with a rustling of skirts. Very formal. Very clean.\nExcept, perhaps, for the slightest playful smirk at the corner of her mouth.\n“Your Grace.”\nHe’d thought about her often since that night in the writer’s office, but\nsomehow it didn’t prepare him for seeing her again in the flesh. “Call me\nLeo,” he said in the end. “I think we’re past titles.”\nShe put a hand on her stomach. “Well, Leo, we have made a child\ntogether.”\nIt wasn’t funny, on the face of it, but he had to smile. The polish of an\nempress with the candour of a sergeant-at-arms.\n“So our mothers tell me.”\n“They make quite the pair, don’t they? As complementary as a long and\na short steel.”\n“And just as deadly.” He put his fists on the lichen-spotted stonework\nbeside her, the ring digging at his palm. Was he really going to do this?\nCould he possibly do this? The whole thing felt like a dream. But far from a\nnightmare.\n“I can only apologise for the ambush,” she said, turning to look at the\nview. The statues standing proud on either side of the Kingsway, the wide\nexpanse of the Square of Marshals, the glinting dome of the Lords’ Round.\n“If it’s any consolation, they did the same to me. I was somewhat…\nsurprised at first.”\n“So was I, I’ll admit.”\nHer eyes came to rest on his, her chin raised in a challenge which he\nfound, for some reason, deeply attractive. He thought of what his friends\nwould say, when he presented a famous beauty as his wife. That’d wipe the\nsmile from Antaup’s face. “I enjoyed our moment together a great deal.”\n“So did I.” He had to clear his throat at the roughness in his voice. “I’ll\nadmit.”\n“But I had thought that would be all it was. A moment.”\n“So had I.” Leo found himself smiling. “I’ll admit.” He’d expected this"

A moment.”\n“So had I.” Leo found himself smiling. “I’ll admit.” He’d expected this\nto be a painful duty, but he was starting to enjoy it. It had the feel of a\ndance. A ritual. A duel.\n“Does my father worry you?”\nHis eyes widened. It hadn’t even occurred to him that he was getting Old\nSticks for a father-in-law. It occurred to him now, the way the slaughterman\noccurs to the pig. The most feared man in the Union, a master torturer with\nan army of Practicals, an enemy of all Leo stood for. “I get the sense he…\ndoesn’t like me very much.”\n“He doesn’t like anyone.”\n“But I get the sense I don’t like him very much—”\n“That would be terrible. If you were planning to marry him.” She raised\none brow. “Are you planning to marry him?”\n“I don’t think your mother would like it.”\n“My father doesn’t own me. Not even a percentage. If we marry, my\nloyalty will be to you. But you should know I am my own woman and do\nthings my own way. I do not plan for that to change.”\n“Wouldn’t want it to.” He admired her spirit. So independent. So\ndetermined. So fierce, even. Isher might like a gentle temperament but Leo\ncouldn’t think of anything worse.\n“It might help if you look at it as a business arrangement.”\n“Is that how you’re looking at it?”\n“Force of habit. And it does make excellent sense. A partnership,\nbetween your title and my wealth. Between your fame and my connections.\nBetween your leadership and my management.”\nPut that way, it did make excellent sense. He enjoyed listening to her\ntalk. So sharp. So confident. So commanding, even. He liked a woman who\ncould take charge. He imagined the admiration when she spoke on his\nbehalf.\n“I can share the burden,” she said. “Take the politics and the paperwork\noff your hands. You can focus on the military aspects. The things you enjoy.\nNo more dusty meetings.”\nHe thought of that stuffy room, those tottering heaps of papers, those\nendless grumbles with Mustred and Clensher and the rest. “Doubt I’ll miss\nthem.”\nShe didn’t seem to take anything so tasteless as steps, but still she drifted\ncloser. He enjoyed watching her move. So graceful. So precise. So regal,\neven. He liked a woman with pride, and Savine dripped with it. With her on\nhis arm, he’d be the envy of the world.\n“Look at it as… a political alliance,” she said. “You are popular. You are\ncelebrated. You are loved. In Midderland, in Angland, in the North, even.\nBut you do not know Adua.” She was looking at his mouth as she came\ncloser. Looking at it in a way he very much enjoyed.\n“It’s true,” he murmured. “I’m a lost little lamb here.”\n“Let me be your shepherdess. I can help you get your way.” By the dead,\nshe was close now. “With the Closed Council. With my father. With the\ngreat men of the realm.” He could smell her. That sweetness, that heady"

That sweetness, that heady\nsharpness. “I know everyone worth knowing. And how to use them.” Her\nscent brought all the excitement of that night rushing back.\nHe found he had held up his open palm, blue stone on the ring twinkling\nin the sun. “My mother gave me this.”\n“It’s beautiful,” said Savine softly.\n“Best I could do on the way from the room to the terrace, anyway— ah.”\nTo his surprise, but by no means disappointment, her hand was between\nhis legs. Already halfway hard, and it took no time for her to get him the\nrest of the way. It only made it more exciting that they were in full view of\nhalf the Agriont with their mothers not ten paces distant.\n“Look at it…” she whispered urgently in his ear, her breath tickling his\ncheek, “as a business arrangement… and a political alliance… that makes\nsuperb sense.” She kissed him, ever so gently, while her hand worked less\nthan gently down below. “Then anything… we can get from it… on a\npersonal level…” She bit his lip, pulled it and let it flap back. “Let’s call it a\nbonus.”\n“Let’s.” He caught Savine’s free hand and slid his mother’s ring onto her\nfinger. It proved too tight to go over the knuckle, but he didn’t care a shit.\nHe caught her in his arms and kissed her, the Agriont spread out below\nthem.\nTo anyone watching, they must have looked truly spectacular.\nMinister of Whispers\n“H\now was the vote?” asked Vick as Lorsen stepped into his office and\nshut the door to the gallery.\nApparently, the Superior had remembered how to smile. His thin lips\nhad a noticeable bend. “The vote was the most fun I have had in some time.\nThey’re already arguing over points of procedure down there, but that’s\nwhat they do when they know they’ve lost. One hundred and fifty-nine\nvotes to stay in the Union. Fifty-four to leave.”\nVick couldn’t keep the slightest curl of satisfaction from her own mouth.\n“Not even close.”\n“Never mind Shenkt, you must have some unnatural powers.” Lorsen\npulled a cork and poured an ungenerous measure of wine into two glasses.\n“Shutting that bastard Shudra up was more than I hoped for, but to bring\nhim over to our side? It could only be sorcery!”\nVick shrugged. “There’s no magic for changing your mind like a\nglimpse of the knife meant to kill you. The Styrians hoped to make him a\nmartyr for their cause. Vitari knew she could win far more votes by killing\nhim and blaming us than by killing any number of our Aldermen. I pointed\nout that Murcatto did much the same thing in Musselia. I mentioned the\npurges that came after, with some help from a couple of eyewitnesses. All I\ndid was show him what ruthless bastards the Styrians really are. Shudra was\nhappy to change his vote.”\n“And that was the start of a landslide! Credit where it’s due!” And\nLorsen wagged a finger at her. “It was clever thinking, to be watching over\nhim.”"

Credit where it’s due!” And\nLorsen wagged a finger at her. “It was clever thinking, to be watching over\nhim.”\nVick shrugged again. “I asked myself what I’d have tried, if I’d been in\nVitari’s place. Anyone could’ve done it.”\n“Not just anyone could have caught the famous Casamir dan Shenkt.”\nVick shrugged one more time. Shrugs cost nothing, after all. “Infamous\nkillers and nobodies, they all go down much the same when you punch\nthem in the knee.”\n“It seems the more far-fetched rumours about him were just that.\nRumours.”\n“Perhaps. The Arch Lector wants him taken back to Adua. His Eminence\nhas some questions.”\n“If we’d lost the vote, it might have been me going back to answer the\nArch Lector’s questions. I freely confess I much prefer it this way.”\nSuperior Lorsen raised his glass. “You have my thanks, Inquisitor, for what\nthey’re worth.”\nVick drank. Lorsen’s wine was as thin and sour as he was. But it was\nwine. She’d counted clean water an impossible luxury once. She never let\nherself forget it.\nSolumeo Shudra was waiting on the gallery, his thick fists propped on\nthe railing as he watched the Assembly at work below.\n“Sounds like they’re arguing as fiercely as ever,” said Vick, stepping up\nbeside him.\n“The swamps will run out of flies,” said Shudra, “before politicians run\nout of arguments. They are already splitting into new factions over the latest\nissue.”\n“Which is?”\n“Spending on sewers. I wanted to thank you once more, before you left.\nI have… never owed anyone my life before.”\n“You get used to it.” Shudra glanced at her, brows raised. More than she\nshould have said already, perhaps. But she felt as if she owed him some\nhonesty. “His Eminence the Arch Lector once gave me a chance.”\n“Not a man known for giving chances.”\n“No. But without that…” She remembered the sound of rushing water,\nin the darkness, the day the mine flooded. She thought of her brother’s face\nas they dragged him away, heels leaving two crooked trails through the\ndirty snow. “I hear the Aldermen voted to remain in the Union?”\n“They did. I never thought I would be happy to say so.” Shudra took a\nlong breath through his nose. “It is easy, perhaps, in the earnest desire to\nlook for something better, to dismiss the virtues of the allies one has and\noverlook the faults of the alternatives.”\n“The Union is far from perfect. We have our rivalries, our greed and our\nambition. That is why we need honest, upright, passionate people. People\nlike you.”\nShudra snorted. “I could almost believe you, Inquisitor. But I am not too\nproud to admit that I misjudged the situation. I misjudged the Union. I\nmisjudged you.”\nVick smiled. She couldn’t help a small one. The satisfaction of a loyal\nservant at a job well done. “It takes a strong man to admit his weakness,\nMaster Shudra.”"

The satisfaction of a loyal\nservant at a job well done. “It takes a strong man to admit his weakness,\nMaster Shudra.”\n“Did you have to hit me so bloody hard?” asked Murdine, rubbing at the\ngreat bruise on the side of his neck.\n“I told you to pad your knee.”\n“Three layers of saddle leather! I can still hardly walk!”\n“It had to look good. You can’t expect the infamous Casamir dan Shenkt\nto go down easily.”\n“I am the world’s most fearsome assassin.” Murdine twisted his mouth\nin a pouting sneer, narrowed his eyes and snarled the words. “Cower in fear,\nAldermen of Westport, for none are safe from my deadly blade! A shame I\nwill never be able to take credit for one of my finest performances.”\n“A little overacted, if you’re asking me.”\n“Pfffft. Everyone’s a bloody critic.”\n“Well, you convinced Shudra.” Vick slipped the purse from her pocket,\nweighed it in her hand, silver clinking. “He was the only audience that\ncounted.”\nMurdine grinned at her. “If you ever need someone to take a punch\nagain, you know my rates.”\n“Doubt I’ll be through here any time soon,” said Vick. “The climate\ndoesn’t suit me.”\n“You never know, I may see you in Adua. I’ve a feeling it might be wise\nto clear out of Westport for the time being. There will no doubt be\nrecriminations following the recent shift in power. Debts to be paid and\nscores to settle.” Murdine glanced nervously about the tavern and twitched\nhis hood further down. “I wouldn’t want to be mistaken for Shenkt a second\ntime.” He gave a little shiver. “Or, for that matter, to run into the real one.”\n“Very wise.”\n“They say Styria’s the home of culture, but when it comes to theatre, all\nthey want is flash and sparkle.” Murdine waved it away with flamboyant\ndisgust. “I want to get at the truth.”\n“The truth is overrated.” Vick let the purse drop into his hand. “An actor\nshould know that.”\nIt was early, the sun an angry clipping over the hills in the east, the rigging\nof the ships casting a cobweb of long shadows on the quay. It was early, but\nthe sooner they were at sea and she was out of this endlessly crowded,\nsuperstitious, suffocating city, the happier she’d be.\nOr the less unhappy, at least.\nTwo Practicals followed Vick and Tallow along the seafront, lugging her\ntrunk between them. They were big men, but they were sweating. There\nwas almost as great a weight of clothes, powders and props inside as Savine\ndan Glokta might have taken on a trip abroad. The many different Victarine\ndan Teufels she might need to slip into. Made her wonder who the real one\nwas. If there was such a thing any more.\n“He was an actor?” muttered Tallow, for about the fifth time, his one\nlittle bag slung over his shoulder.\n“An actor and acrobat. He’s very particular on that point.”"

Or\nsomething?”\n“Then there are always more actors.” She gave a sigh that tasted of salt\nand sea rot and the acrid smoke from the tanneries down the coast, just\nstarting up for the day. “Every idiot wants to be one.”\n“Was the real Shenkt even in the city?”\n“Who says there even is a real Shenkt? People like things that are\nsimple. Black and white. Good and evil. They want to make a choice and\ntell themselves they were right. But as His Eminence is fond of saying, the\nreal world is painted in greys. The truth is complicated, full of mixed\nemotions and blurred outcomes and each-way bets. The truth… is a hard\nsell.”\nThey’d reached the ship, now. An unappealing tub in need of a good\ncareening, but it was sailing the right way. The two Practicals set down\nVick’s trunk with a clatter. One unceremoniously planted his arse on it\nwhile he stretched out his back, the other pulled his mask aside to wipe his\nsweaty face.\n“It helps to give people a straightforward story, with villains to boo and\nheroes to root for.” Vick narrowed her eyes as she looked out to sea. “In my\nexperience, that means making them up.”\n“But who’s—”\nDoesn’t matter how sharp you are. No one can be ready all the time.\nSomething flashed past. One of the two Practicals. He didn’t make a\nsound. He didn’t have time. Just flew a dozen strides and crashed into the\nside of a boat, staving in the planking in a cloud of splinters.\nTallow shrank back, hands over his head. Vick whipped around to see\nthe other Practical tumbling across the quay, limbs bonelessly flopping. She\ncaught a glimpse of a black figure against the rising sun, coming impossibly\nfast. She was just raising her arm, she hardly even knew what to do, when it\nwas caught with irresistible strength. She was jerked off her feet, the world\nreeled, and the quayside smashed her in the chest and drove her breath out\nin a choking wheeze.\nShe saw boots through the blur. Well-worn old work boots. Then\nsomething was over her face. Darkness and her own booming breath. Hands\ntied behind her. Scrape of her toes as she was dragged along under the\narmpits. Hiss over the cobbles. Clack, clack, clack over the boards of a\nwharf.\nShe gathered herself, trying to think through the throbbing in her head,\nthe burning ache in her shoulder. She might only get one chance. She might\nnot even get one chance. She shoved a boot down, tried to twist free, but\nshe was gripped tight as barrel bands. Pain stabbed up her arm, made her\ngasp through gritted teeth.\n“Better not,” said a man’s voice in her ear. A soft, bland, bored-sounding\nvoice."

Boots clonked and rattled on a loose\nfloor. She felt herself dumped into a chair. A creak of wood and a hiss of\nrope as her hands were tied fast to the back, her ankles to the legs.\n“All right, take it off.”\nThe bag was pulled from her head.\nSome gloomy shed with a tar-and-fish stink. Shafts of light shone\nthrough the cracks between the timbers of its walls. Slimy lobster cages\nwere stacked to one side. Vick wondered if this was the place she’d die. She\nguessed she’d seen worse.\nA tall woman perched on a table with arms folded, looking down at Vick\nthrough narrowed eyes. Her grey hair was short and spiky, her sharp face\ndeeply lined. Late fifties, maybe. Calm and professional. Not trying to be\nmenacing. There was no need.\n“Know who I am?” she asked. A Styrian accent, but she spoke common\nwell. Like someone who’d spent a lot of time in the Union.\nVick’s head was thumping where it had hit the quay. Blood tickling her\nscalp. Her shoulder was throbbing worse and worse. But she made sure to\nshow as little pain as possible. Show hurt, you’re asking to be hurt. “I’ve a\nguess,” she said.\n“Well, don’t keep us in suspense.”\n“You’re Shylo Vitari, Minister of Whispers for the Serpent of Talins.” If\nOld Sticks had an opposite number on this side of the Circle Sea, here she\nsat.\n“Very good.” Hard wrinkles showed around Vitari’s eyes as she smiled.\n“I like her already. You like her?”\nThe bored man gave a non-committal grunt. As if liking or disliking\nthings wasn’t really his business. He finished tying Tallow to his chair the\nway he’d tied Vick to hers. Quick and practised, like he’d done it many\ntimes before.\n“Know who this is?” Vitari nodded towards him as he tested the knots\non Tallow’s bonds.\nVick hardly wanted to answer. “I’ve a guess.”\n“Let’s see if you can make it two of two.”\n“He’s Casamir dan Shenkt.”\n“The real one,” said Vitari. “Imagine that.”\nStyria’s most infamous killer, if it really was him, gave Vick a watery,\nslightly apologetic smile. Few men had ever looked so ordinary. Gaunt and\ncolourless, with dark rings around his eyes. But then awesome looks put\npeople on their guard, and that’s the last thing a killer wants. He leaned\nback against the wall and pulled something from a pocket. A piece of wood,\nroughly carved. He began to whittle it with a little curved knife, blade\nflashing, white shavings scattering about his worn boots.\n“Do you go by Victarine?” asked Vitari. “It’s quite the mouthful. Maybe\nyour friends call you Vick?”\n“Maybe they would. If I had any.”\n“You’ve got at least one.” She grinned down at Tallow and he stared"

If I had any.”\n“You’ve got at least one.” She grinned down at Tallow and he stared\nback at her with those big, sad eyes, and grunted something into his gag no\none could understand.\nVick didn’t like the thought that he’d ended up in that chair because of\nher. “No need to hurt him,” she wanted to say, and, “It’s me you want,” and\nall the bloody clichés, but that would’ve been good as telling them this\nstringy fool was a chink in her armour. So Vick didn’t even glance in his\ndirection. She treated him like he was nothing. It was all she could do for\nhim.\n“Do you know the irony, Vick?” Vitari slowly sat forward, wrists on her\nknees and her long hands dangling. “We were there. In the Temple Square,\nwaiting for Shudra, so we could kill him and pretend you’d done it.”\nWhen you’ve nothing to add, stay silent.\n“Then we saw you coming, and we thought, if you’re fool enough to kill\nhim yourself… why not let you save us the trouble?”\nMore silence.\n“But you weren’t there to kill him. You were there to pretend we’d tried,\nso you could pretend to save him. I watched the whole thing with a growing\nsense of annoyance, then a growing sense of admiration. It was very neat,\nwasn’t it?”\nShenkt’s only contribution was the soft scraping of his knife.\n“Who was he? Your fake assassin? An actor?”\n“And acrobat,” said Vick. “I found him in a circus.”\nVitari grinned. “Nice touch. Well, he can take a punch. You gave him\nquite the beating.”\n“He was a bit upset about it.”\n“So am I,” said Vitari, her grin vanishing. “The Grand Duchess\nMonzcarro is going to be quite irked. And believe me, you haven’t really\nseen irked until you’ve seen the Serpent of Talins irked. Do you think\nyou’re clever?”\nVick tried to shift her throbbing shoulder into a more comfortable\nposition, but there was none. “I’ve felt cleverer.”\n“I think you’re clever. I don’t often find people who can get the better of\nme. When I do, I’d rather have them work for me than work against. Or\ndead, I guess. But dead would be a waste, wouldn’t it?”\nShenkt gave that grunt again, as though it was the same to him either\nway.\n“So, how about it?” Vitari looked sideways at her. “After a new job? You\ncould tell me secrets. What the Union’s planning, where they’re weak,\nwhere they’re strong, that kind of thing.”\nThump, thump, thump went the pulse in Vick’s head and the blood\ntickled at her scalp and it occurred to her this might be one of those turning\npoints. Like in the mine, when she chose to run. Or in the camps, when she\nchose to tell. Or in Valbeck, when she chose to stay. Her mouth felt very dry\nall of a sudden.\n“I’ve already got a job,” she said.\nVitari’s brows drew in. Grey brows, with just a few orange flecks in"

Back before he was Old\nSticks. Young Sticks, would you say?”\nShenkt shrugged, as though he wouldn’t say much about anything, and\npursed his lips, and blew a puff of dust from his carving.\n“We were in Dagoska together, during the siege.” Vitari gave a faraway\nsigh. “So many happy memories. He’s a clever bastard. Fearless. And\nruthless. Understands pain like no one else I ever knew. Lots to admire. But\nit’s not as though he really pulls the strings himself, is it?”\nShe narrowed her eyes slightly, as if she was waiting for Vick to chime\nin. She’d a feeling there was some piece to this conversation she was\nmissing. But when you’ve nothing to add, stay silent.\n“Bayaz.” Shenkt pronounced both syllables crisply in Vick’s ear, and his\nbreath felt chill, like the draught through a window on a winter evening, and\nit made the hairs on her neck rise almost painfully.\n“The First of the Magi?” The idea of that self-satisfied old bastard\npulling anyone’s strings seemed hard to credit.\n“The Union has been his tool since he first brought it together in the\ndays of Harod the Great.”\n“You want ruthless?” Vitari gave a low whistle. “Should’ve seen Adua\nafter he was done with it. He already has you dancing to his tune, I reckon.”\n“I never even met the man.”\n“And yet you came to Westport with more than a trunk full of clothes.”\nVitari leaned closer, voice dropping to a breathy murmur. A voice for\nsecrets. A voice for threats. “You came with Valint and Balk’s debts. With\nValint and Balk’s trade rights. With Valint and Balk’s money.”\n“What have Valint and Balk got to do with Bayaz?”\n“They’re three names for the same thing,” murmured Shenkt.\nVitari slowly shook her head. “Dark company you keep.”\n“Really?” Vick jerked her head towards Stryia’s most infamous assassin.\n“I heard he eats people.”\n“As rarely as possible,” he said, without a trace of irony. “That bank\nchomps up dozens a day.”\n“So how about it?” Vitari stuck her lips out in a pout. “Come work for\nme. Stand with the righteous. Or as close as the likes of us will get.”\nVick looked down at the ground, the blood thump, thump, thumping in\nher skull louder than ever. “I owe Glokta.” It surprised her, that she said it.\nIt surprised her, how sure she sounded. “Reckon I’ll stick with him. Till the\ndebt’s paid.”\nTallow made a high-pitched squeak into his gag. Vitari gave a long sigh.\nShenkt issued that indifferent grunt one more time. Vick bared her teeth,\nback prickling, expecting the blade. Any moment now. The brittle silence\nstretched, almost unbearable.\n“That’s interesting,” said Vitari.\n“Mmm,” said Shenkt, slipping his carving away but keeping the knife\nout."

Or tried to work me somehow. Someone clever as you\nwould’ve seen that right off. So why not just tell me yes?”\nVick looked up at her. “Because I want you to believe me.”\n“Huh.” Vitari smiled wide. Good teeth she had, for a woman her age. “I\nlike that. Do you like that?”\n“I do,” said Shenkt.\nVitari pulled out a slip of paper, and folded it, and pressed the fold sharp\nwith her thumbnail, then she opened Vick’s shirt pocket, and slipped the\npaper inside, and gave it a pat. “Once you realise how things really are, go\nto this address. The barman there will have what you need.”\n“He has what everyone needs,” said Shenkt.\n“Until then, if I was you…” Vitari stood and strolled towards the door,\nwagging one long finger. “I wouldn’t come back to Styria.”\n“We’re in Westport,” said Vick. “This is the Union.”\n“For now.” Vitari drew the bolt and opened the door. Shenkt slipped\naway that little curved knife, pulled up his hood and walked out, humming\nfaintly to himself, leaving nothing but a scattering of pale shavings on the\nboards.\nIt looked like Vick would live out the day after all.\n“How do we get free?” she called, still trussed up tight.\nVitari paused, a long, black shape in the bright doorway. “You’re the\nclever one. You work it out.”\nLate\n“Y\nou are late, Rikke.”\nShe opened her eyes. Candle flames in the darkness. Hundreds of\nflames, like stars prickling a night sky. Or were they the ghosts where\ncandles once burned, long ago?\n“You might be too late.”\nA face swam at her. Lank grey hair, and shadows in the deep lines, and\ncandlelight glimmering on the golden wire.\n“There is no time left.”\nStrong fingers pressed at Rikke’s face, pressed at the sore flesh around\nher burning left eye, and she grunted, squirmed, but she was too weak to\nmove.\n“There must be a price.”\nA hand lifted her head, the rim of a cup pressed to her mouth. She\ncoughed on something bitter, shuddered as she swallowed.\n“You have to choose, Rikke.”\nShe felt afraid. Terrified. She tried to twist away but strong hands held\nher down, held her tight.\n“Which will it be?”\nThe woman reached for her. Something glittered in her hand. A cold\nneedle.\n“No,” whispered Rikke, closing her eyes. “This hasn’t happened yet.”\nShivers held her hand. Held so tight it hurt.\n“Can’t lose you, Rikke.” The grey stubble on his grey cheek shifted as\nhe clenched his jaw. “Can’t do it.”\n“Not planning to be lost.” Her tongue felt all thick and clumsy, she could\nhardly make the words. “But if I am you’ll get through it. Lost your eye,"

Lost your eye,\ndidn’t you, and you were a good deal closer to that.”\n“I’ve got another eye. There’s just one o’ you.”\nIt was dawn, she thought. Slap and suck of water on shingle. Cold light\non rocks streaked with damp. A cobweb fluttered in the breeze, glittering\ndewdrops dancing.\n“You don’t know what I was.” Shivers fussed at that ring with the red\nstone he wore on his little finger. “I cared for nothing. Hated everything.\nCame to serve your father ’cause of all the men I hated, he was the one I\nhated least. I walked in a nightmare.” He shut his eyes. Or the one that\ncould see. The other showed a slit of gleaming metal still.\n“You were so sick, then. No one thought you’d last another winter. Your\nmother dead and your father grieving. So sick, but so full of hope. You\ntrusted me. Me, with nothing in him to trust. You sucked goat’s milk from a\ncloth, in my arms. Your father said I was the least likely nursemaid he ever\nsaw. Said I brought you back from the brink.” He looked at her then, and a\ntear streaked from his good eye. “But it was you brought me back.”\n“You soft fool,” she croaked through her cracked lips. “You can’t cry.\nNot you.”\n“When I was a boy, my brother called me pig fat, I cried so easy. Then I\nforgot how. All I wanted was to be feared. But you never feared me.”\n“Well, you’re not so scary as they all make out.” Rikke tried to shift, but\nnothing was comfortable. She felt her eyes drifting closed, and Shivers\nsqueezed her hand so hard it made her gasp.\n“Hold on, Rikke. She’s coming.”\n“No,” she said, tears stinging her lids. “This hasn’t happened yet.”\nTwo great stones loomed into the evening, black fingers against the pink\nsky. Ancient, they were, splattered with moss and lichen, carved with\nsymbols that time had pitted and smudged all meaning from. There was a\nhint of drizzle in the air and the hair was stuck to Rikke’s face and\neverything had a watery sheen.\nA pair of guards stood by the stones, holding crude spears, so still Rikke\ntook them for statues. As Shivers carried her closer, she saw there was\nsomething wrong about them. Misshapen.\n“By the dead,” croaked Rikke. “They’re flatheads.”\n“That they are,” said Scenn. The hillman stood grinning next to one of\nthe Shanka and it narrowed its already narrow eyes at him while it used a\nsplinter of bone to pick at one huge tooth. “They guard the witch. She can\nspeak to ’em. Sings to ’em, some say. They’re tame. Long as we behave.”\n“I always behave,” said Isern, frowning at those two flatheads with her\ngrip tight on the dark haft of her spear.

Far as Shanka have expressions\nbeyond just a lot of teeth, these ones seemed to frown back. “Let’s go,\nthen.”\nScenn shook his head. “I go no further.”\n“I know you to be many things, Scenn, and most of ’em bad, but I never\ntook you for a coward.”\n“Take me for whatever you like, sister, but I know where I belong, and\nit’s on this side of the stones. My task was to bring you and my task is done.\nI don’t pretend to be—”\n“Shit on you, then, you hill of blubber,” and Isern elbowed him out of\ntheir way and strode on.\n“Just the three of us.” Shivers grunted as he shifted Rikke higher up his\nshoulders. Made her feel like a child again, being carried like this, his hands\naround her ankles. On between the stones and down a steep path through\ntrees. Old, old trees with whispers in their high, high branches and their\njealous roots delving deep, deep, knotted like misers’ fingers.\nAround a bend and Rikke saw the shore. Grey shingle stretching down\nto grey water, blurred reflections of the tall trees prickled by rain-ripples. A\nfew strides out, all was lost in a mist, and beyond that Rikke could see\nnothing, and somewhere a lonely owl hooted at the sunset.\n“The forbidden lake,” said Isern. “Not far to go now.”\n“Always has to be a mist, doesn’t there?” grunted Shivers.\nIsern set off, her boots crunching in the shingle. “I guess nothing looks\nso magical, d’you see, as what can’t be seen at all.”\n“No,” whispered Rikke, closing her eyes. “This hasn’t happened yet.”\nNight, and firelight danced on the gathered faces. Withered old faces and\nfresh young ones. Faces pricked with the swirling tattoos of the hillmen.\nFaces that weren’t there yet, maybe, or had been there long ago. Rikke\ncould hardly tell today from yesterday from tomorrow any longer. Meat\nspat and sizzled. The cold, crisp air of the hills on the back of Rikke’s head\nbut the warmth of the fire on her face and she grinned at the simple pleasure\nof it, snuggled into a smelly old fur.\n“I don’t like it,” said Scenn, shaking his great fat head.\n“You’ve confused me with someone who’d spare a turd on what you like\nor don’t,” said Isern.\nTwo siblings could hardly have been less alike. Isern, spear-hard and\ndagger-faced with her crow-black hair in a long tangle. Scenn, huge as a\nhouse with hands like hams and a face like a pudding, hair shaved back to a\nred fuzz on his creased scalp.\n“Don’t like going up there,” he said, frowning northwards, between the\nfirelit hovels to the archway of crooked branches. “It’s forbidden for a\nreason.”\n“I need you to take us, not voice your opinions. They’re as bloated with\nwind as you are.”"

They’re as bloated with\nwind as you are.”\n“You need not be so harsh about it,” said Scenn, kneading at his belly\nand looking a touch hurt. He frowned over at Shivers. “She’s harsh as a\nwhipping, ain’t she?”\nShivers raised his brows. Or the one he had, anyway. “You say that like\nit’s a bad thing.”\n“She has to go up there and that’s all there is to it,” snapped Isern,\nharshly. “This girl matters, Scenn. She’s beloved of the moon. I’ve always\nknown it.”\n“You’ve confused me with someone who’d spare a turd on what you\nknow or don’t,” said Scenn. “I’m not taking her just ’cause you say so.”\n“No, you’re taking her because she has to go.”\n“Because she has the Long Eye?”\n“Because she has the Long Eye so strong it’s killing her.”\nScenn looked over at Rikke, then. Small, dark eyes he had, but she saw\nthe sharpness in them. Beware of clever men, her father told her once. But\nbeware most of clever men who look like fools. “What do you say, girl?”\nAnd he spat a bit of gristle into the fire and pointed at her with the stripped-\nbare bone. “If you can see the future, tell me mine.”\nRikke leaned forward then, the fur slipping from her shoulders, and she\nturned her burning left eye on him and opened it wide. He flinched back as\nshe raised her left hand, pointing with her forefinger towards the glittering\nstars, and spoke in ringing tones her prophecy.\n“I… see… you’re going to get fatter!”\nLaughter around the fire at that. An old woman with just one tooth\nlaughed so hard she nearly fell over, and a young one had to slap her on the\nback till she coughed up a shred of meat.\nShivers tapped his ale cup against hers and Rikke took a swig and settled\nback into her fur. There weren’t a lot of things would bring someone to\nSlorfa, but they made good ale, the hillmen, her head was dizzy with it. Or\nmaybe that was the sickness of the Long Eye. Hard to tell the difference.\nScenn frowned, settling his bulk cross-legged.\n“She has a sense of humour, then. She’ll need that, up in the High\nPlaces. There are few laughs at the forbidden lake.” He frowned towards\nIsern again. “Do you really think this little shred of gristle, this little snot\nwith the ring through her nose, is beloved of the moon?”\nIsern spat ale in the fire and made it hiss. “What would you know about\nit, Scenn-i-Phail, who carries our father’s hammer?”\nScenn stuck his beard out at her. “I’d know as much as you, Isern-i-\nPhail, who carries our father’s spear. Just because he loved you best, don’t\nthink you learned the most from him.”\n“You’re joking, you sheep-fucker! Our father hated me.”"

He loathed the guts and face and arse of you, head to toe.”\nScenn paused a moment. “And you were his favourite.”\nAnd the two of them burst out laughing together. They might not have\nlooked much alike but their laughter was the same. Mad, cackling peels that\nsounded halfway to wolves howling while overhead the full moon hung fat\nand round, and they smashed their cups together and sent up a fountain of\nale and drained what was left and carried on laughing.\nShivers watched them, face in shadow. “This’ll be a long month, I\nreckon.”\n“No,” said Rikke, snuggling into that smelly fur and shutting her eyes.\n“This hasn’t happened yet.”\n“Always upwards,” gasped Rikke, shading her eyes against the sun and\nsquinting uphill.\n“That’s going into the hills for you.” Isern wasn’t even out of breath.\nNothing ever tired her.\n“Where are we headed, exactly?” asked Shivers, his boots crunching on\nthe dirt path.\n“To the forbidden lake.”\n“That much I know. I’m asking where it is.”\n“If they told everyone where it was, it wouldn’t be very forbidden,\nwould it?”\nShivers rolled his eyes. Or eye, at least. “Do you have any straight\nanswers, woman?”\n“What use are straight answers in a crooked world?”\nShivers gave Rikke a glance, but she was too out of breath to do much\nmore than shrug. “How… do we get there… then?” she asked between her\nwheezes.\n“My brother Scenn knows the way. He is a turd in the shape of a man,\nbut he’ll help. We’ll head to his village first, which is a turd in the shape of\na village. Slorfa, they call it, at the head of the valley four valleys on.”\n“Sounds… a long way,” muttered Rikke.\n“One foot in front of the other will get it done with time.”\n“How many brothers do you have?” asked Shivers.\n“Eleven of the bastards, and each more like a dog’s arse than the last.”\nRikke raised her brows. “You don’t… talk about ’em much.”\n“We all had different mothers,” said Isern, as though that explained the\nwhole business. “My upbringing was less than happy. An ordeal, d’you see?\nLiving through it once was bad enough but had to be done. Remembering it\nis a thing I aim to avoid.”\nIsern stopped on a heap of rocks, and pulled out a flask, and splashed\nwater over her head and some more in her mouth and offered it to Rikke.\nBy the dead, she was weary. She stood, swallowed water, wiped sweat\nfrom her forehead. It was springing out about as fast as she could drink it.\nHer vest was soaked through. She reeked like a haystack after the rains.

Back down the long miles walked towards\nUffrith. Into the past.\n“Let’s make some footprints,” grunted Isern, turning back to the steeply\nclimbing trail. “The forbidden lake won’t be coming to us, will it?”\nRikke blew out so hard she made her lips flap and wiped a fresh sheen of\nsweat from her forehead.\n“Need to ride on my shoulders?” asked Shivers. Most folk couldn’t even\nhave told he was smiling. But she knew how to tell.\n“Never, you old bastard,” she growled, setting off. “More likely I’ll be\ncarrying you.”\n“That I’d like to see,” Isern threw over her shoulder, and stones scattered\nfrom the heel of her scuffed boot and down the bald track.\n“No,” muttered Rikke, closing her eyes. “This hasn’t happened yet.”\n“Found you!” shouted Leo in that piping voice with the strange accent,\ncatching hold of Rikke’s foot and dragging her out of the hay.\nShe’d soon realised they’d be man and woman grown by the time he\nfound her if she’d stayed in her first hiding place, up among the rafters\nwhere the pigeons nested. She’d enjoyed looking down on him hunting\naround the barn, but when he wandered off to look elsewhere she got bored\nand dropped down, burrowed into the hay and left one boot sticking out\nwhere he could see it. Games are only fun if they’re close, after all.\n“Took you long enough,” she said.\nHe was pretty, Rikke thought, even if he wasn’t the cleverest. And he\nhad an odd manner and talked strange. But being brought up in the Union\nwould do that to a boy, maybe, and for pretty you could forgive a lot.\nShe was glad he was here, anyway. Nice to have someone her age to\nplay with. She liked to pretend she was happiest on her own, but no one is,\nreally. Her da was always busy having the long talks with the grey-bearded\nbastards where everyone frowned and shook their heads a lot.\nShivers would tell her stories sometimes, about his travels around the\nCircle of the World and all the different styles o’ strange folk he’d killed\nthere, but she felt there was something odd about a friendship between a\nlittle girl and one o’ the most feared warriors in the North. He said he didn’t\nmind but she didn’t want to push it.\nThere weren’t many children in Uffrith and those there were thought she\nwas cursed and wouldn’t come near her on account of the fits. Leo didn’t\nseem worried about the fits. Maybe he would be once he saw her having\none. Specially if she shat herself during, which was more often than not,\nsadly. But there wasn’t much she could do about that. About the fits or the\nshits."

Her father always said there\nwas nothing more important than your word, usually while frowning and\nshaking his head. It was a shame he frowned so much, ’cause when he\nsmiled it lit the world up.\n“My turn to hide!” shouted Leo, and he dashed off, slipped and fell,\nrolled in a shower of hay dust, then scrambled up and disappeared through\nthe barn door.

A battle’s\nno place for a self-respecting warrior. But if you must attend one, at least\nhave the good taste to be where the fighting isn’t.”\n“What if some bastard tries to kill you?”\n“Ideally, you’d have worked that out a while back and done ’em first,\npreferably while they’re asleep. That’s what knives are for.”\n“That and slicing cheese,” said Sholla, lifting her knife towards her\nmouth with furious concentration, a cheese-shaving so fine it was almost\nsee-through clinging to the flat. A spring gust came through the courtyard\njust as it was getting to her lips and blew it away like thistledown, left her\nclutching helpless at the air.\n“That’s the thing about knives,” said Clover. “Cheap to get and with\nendless applications. Swords are dear as all hell and they’ve got just the\none, and it’s one every man should avoid.”\nFlick crunched up his face. “You’re sort of talking yourself out of a job\nhere, far as the teaching of sword-work goes.”\n“Aye, but life being what it is, mistakes happen. That’s when an\nunderstanding of sword-work might save your worthless hide from an\nunsightly hole or two, as it’s saved mine on a couple of regrettable\noccasions.

Since Magweer’s\nuntimely demise, he’d taken on the role of Stour’s chief sneerer.\n“Who’s this?” he sneered.\n“This is Flick. I’m teaching him how to use the blade. Or how not to.”\n“He looks a bloody idiot,” said Greenway.\n“Aye, well, there’s a short supply of men clever as you. Have to make do\nwith what we’re given. Stour ready for me?”\n“The king, you mean.”\nClover stared back blankly. “Aye, the king I do mean. Stour is the king\nand the king is Stour. We were both there when he hung the chain round his\nneck, weren’t we?” They’d both been there and they’d both been bloody.\nGreenway shifted his thumbs in his sword-belt. “One o’ these days\nyou’ll say too much, Clover.”\n“Well, the mud’s waiting for us all. Worse ways to get there than\nexcessive conversation. Now, shall we take the news to the Great Wolf?”\nHe nodded at the sack, which had drawn the attention of at least half of\nCarleon’s flies. “Bring that along, eh, Flick?”\nThe lad wrinkled his nose. “You sure? It’s got quite the odour.”\n“That’s the way of things, lad, we all end up stinking. And yes, I’m sure.\nIt’s not for my benefit, I can tell you that.”\n“Stay out o’ trouble, eh, Chief?” grunted Sholla, eyes fixed on her knife\nand her cheese.\n“Believe it or not, I’ve spent fifteen years trying.”\n“What the bloody hell are you about, anyway?” Downside was asking as\nClover went to answer the king’s call.\n“If you get it right,” murmured Sholla, “it just melts on your tongue…”\nFlick looked like he was about to swing the sack over his shoulder, saw\nthe stains and decided against. He wasn’t strong enough to hold it at arm’s\nlength, though, so it ended up knocking against one knee as he walked with\na wet clumping. “Never met a king,” he said.\n“No?” said Clover. “I’d have thought you’d be in daily contact with\nroyalty.”\n“Eh?”\n“Just keep your mouth shut and smile.”\nFlick made a gurning rictus of the lower half of his face.\n“Smile, I said.

The big creaking doors with their great iron hinges, the high rafters,\nthe tall windows, the bright, cold sun beyond and the sound of rushing\nwater far below. Skarling’s Chair was the same one Bethod, and Black\nDow, and Scale Ironhand had sat in, hard and simple, paint worn off the\ntime-polished arms and flaking from the back.\nThe man sitting in it was new, though. Stour Nightfall, who men called\nthe Great Wolf, with his left leg hooked over one of the arms and the bare\nfoot gently swinging, a very fine wolfskin cloak about his shoulders and\ngrinning like a wolf indeed. Why wouldn’t he smile? Got everything he\nwanted, hadn’t he? No longer king-in-waiting but king all the way, and all\nhe’d had to do was stab his uncle in the throat.\nEverything boiled over with menace in there. The faces of the young\nwarriors, unsmiling, like life was a contest at having the least fun. The\nflames in the great fireplace stabbed angrily. Even the cups on the tables\nseemed to be nursing a slight. There was this horrible quiet, everyone\nholding their breath, expecting violence to strike like lightning any moment.\n“You should be kneeling,” growled Greenway as they stopped in the\nmidst of that wide stone floor in front of Stour.\nClover raised his brows. “Thought I’d at least walk in first. Guess I\ncould shuffle in on my knees but that’d wear quite considerably on my\ntrousers and everyone’s patience.” He twirled his finger around, turning\nback towards the door. “But I’ll happily head back out and start again if\nthere’s a better way to go about it—”\n“You don’t need to kneel, Clover,” said Stour, waving him closer. “Old\nfriend like you? Don’t be a cunt, Greenway.”\nGreenway gave an epic sneer which made him, in Clover’s opinion, look\nmore of a cunt than ever. Some men just can’t help themselves. All the ones\nin this room, certainly. It was then he noticed there was a new cage in the\ncorner, hanging from one of the high rafters, gently turning. Didn’t seem a\ngood sign. There was someone in it, too, naked and beaten bloody but with\neyes still open. That seemed an even worse sign.\n“Unless I’m mistook,” said Clover, “you’ve got Gregun Hollowhead in a\ncage.”\nStour narrowed his eyes. “I’ve a room full of bastards to tell me what I\nknow already.”\n“I could’ve sworn he was on our side.”\n“I had my doubts,” said Stour, curling his lip at the cage. “When I raised\nhis taxes, he didn’t want to pay. Felt quite angry about it. Made other folk\nangry.”\n“How’s he feeling now, d’you reckon?” asked Greenway.\nClover scratched gently at his scar. “Bit sore, by the look o’ things.”\n“My father was always for buying him off,” said Stour. “Him and men\nlike him.”\n“Black Calder’s a great one for compromise.”\n“I’m not.”\n“No,” said Clover. “I see that.”"

No gratitude. They don’t think about what\nthey’ve already got from you, only about what they can get next.”\n“There’s a lot of arseholes about, all right,” said Clover, letting his eyes\nsweep across Stour’s closest.\n“And Hollowhead and his sons and all those shits from the West Valleys,\nthey’re closer to Uffrith than Carleon. Don’t trust ’em.”\n“Do you trust ’em more now?”\n“At least we all know where we stand.”\n“The Nail’s one of his sons, no? Dangerous man, that.”\nThe warriors ranged about the walls competed to look more dangerous\nthemselves. “You scared?” asked Greenway.\n“Constantly,” said Clover, “but that’s probably just my age. What you\ngoing to do with Hollowhead?”\nStour glowered at the cage and gave a great sniff. “Still thinking. Let\nhim go so he can pay the taxes or cut the bloody cross in him as an\nexample.”\n“He’ll have taught folk a good lesson whichever you choose,” said\nGreenway.\nClover had his doubts as he watched that cage gently turn. Hollowhead\nwas a popular man. Lot of friends and family all over those valleys on the\nborder with Uffrith. Lot of hard fighters who’d be less than happy about that\nman being in a cage. Black Calder had spent years stitching the ripped-up\nNorth together with threats and whispers and debts and favours. Can’t do it\njust with fear alone. But it was hardly Clover’s job to say so.\nHe looked away from Hollowhead and smiled. “Well, I wish you joy of\nthe outcome, whatever you decide.”\n“Huh.” Stour’s wet, sly eyes slid back to Clover. “And how about you?\nGet some joy out o’ the Shanka?”\n“Joy is not the word I’d pick, my king, but when your chief gives you a\ntask, as old Threetrees used to say, you get on with it, so we bowed to the\ninevitable. You know me, I don’t mind bowing. Specially not to the\ninevitable.”\n“Got no pride, eh, Clover?”\n“Used to have, my king. Used to have a fucking surfeit. Like a field in\nspring can draw too many bees. But I found when you’re struggling, there’s\nnot a lot you can buy with the stuff. Pride, that is, not bees. So I shed mine.\nDon’t miss it in the least.”\nStour narrowed his eyes at Flick. “Who’s this?”\n“This is Flick.” And Clover clapped a hand down on the lad’s scrawny\nshoulder. “He’s my best man.”\n“He looks a good one,” said Stour, and his arseholes laughed. More\narseholes than there used to be. The North had an infinite supply.\n“Man should have friends, I reckon,” said Clover.\n“Definitely. Need someone to stab, don’t you?”\nMore laughter.

He\njerked his head sideways at Flick. “Need me to stab him, my king?”\n“Nah. Y’already proved what you are, Clover. I’d hate to take your best\nman away. What’s he got there?”\n“Little present for you.” Clover took the bag from Flick and upended it,\nand the Shanka heads bounced and rolled out across the floor. He wished\nthose had been the first scattered across Skarling’s Hall, but he’d a sorry\nsense severed heads had been quite a frequent decoration down the years.\nGreenway took a step back with his arm across his face. “They fucking\nstink!”\n“Don’t be a cunt, Greenway.” Stour sprang eagerly from his chair and\ntrotted over to look down at ’em, still a trace of a limp when he moved from\nthe Young Lion’s sword-cut. “So you taught the Shanka a lesson, eh?”\n“Not sure flatheads really learn lessons,” said Clover.\n“Not these ones, anyway.” Stour nudged the half-rotten heads around\nwith one bare foot so he could see their leering faces. “Ugly bastards, eh?”\n“I find myself on shaky ground when it comes to criticising others’\nlooks,” said Clover.\n“And we none of us look our best dead,” added Flick, then cleared his\nthroat and looked down at the ground. “My king.”\n“Oh, I don’t know,” said Stour, giving him that wet-eyed stare. “I can\nthink of quite a few folk I’d prefer as corpses. I’m heading down to Uffrith,\nClover. Like you to come along.”\n“To fight?”\n“No, no, no.” Which was something of a relief, as Clover couldn’t say\nhe’d much enjoyed their last war with the Union. “Gave my word in the\nCircle, didn’t I? Swore a solemn oath to the Young Lion! Think I’d break\nmy word?”\n“Honestly, my king, I haven’t a fucking clue what you’ll do one moment\nto the next.”\nStour grinned. “Well, wouldn’t life be dull if you could see everything\ncoming? You know a fellow called Oxel?”\n“One o’ the Dogman’s War Chiefs. Wouldn’t trust him to hold the bucket\nwhile I pissed.”\n“Sometimes a shifty bastard’s what you need, though, eh? Dogman’s on\nthe way out. Old. And sick, I hear. When he’s gone, Uffrith needs to go to\nsomeone. Oxel wants it to be me.”\n“And what about that solemn oath in the Circle?”\nStour shrugged. “Swore not to take it. Didn’t say a thing about it\ndropping in my lap. Uffrith wants to be part o’ the North, who am I to\nargue?”\n“And if there’s some don’t want to join?” asked Clover.\nStour nodded towards the cage. “I can get more o’ those. Off you go,\nnow.”\n“And take your stinking heads with you,” hissed Greenway.\n“Don’t be a cunt!” roared Stour, spraying spit, and all around the hall"

Greenway backed off, white and\ntrembling, no doubt thinking the Great Leveller had a hand on his shoulder.\nThen Stour grinned bigger’n ever. And he squatted down on his\nhaunches, that beautiful wolfskin cloak dragging in the mess the heads had\nleft. He took the biggest one in his hands and set it right-side up, its great\nspiked helmet still on and its great long bloated tongue hanging from its\noversized jaws.\n“I want to look at ’em.”\nThe Demon That Breaks All Chains\n“B\ny all the dead,” croaked Rikke as she lifted her head. Her mouth tasted\nlike graves, her empty stomach squelched and bubbled. Felt like there was a\nmace hanging behind her eyes, bashing painfully against the inside of her\nskull with every movement. But at least time was going all one way.\nShe’d been sleeping in a nest of furs but with hard rock underneath, and\nshe dragged a dusty old deerskin around her shoulders, stumbling from the\ndarkness, eyes almost closed against the stabbing light.\nIt wasn’t raining but there was a chilly damp in the air that turned\neverything dark. No wind. No sound. Everything still as the land of the\ndead. Tall trees, black wood and black needles. Jumbles of black rock\njutting on the slopes. Tall black mountains in the far-off distance, white-\nbearded and white-capped like grumpy old warriors. Dark shingle sloped\ndown from the cave-mouth to the dark water, and in its mirror the trees and\nthe rocks and the mountains all reflected, still and perfect and darker than\never. A woman stood there, tattered skirts tucked into her belt, up to her\nthin, pale, veiny calves in the lake. Stood so still she didn’t make a ripple.\nRikke puffed out her cheeks. When she bent to roll up her trouser legs,\nher head throbbed so hard she nearly fell. She hitched the bald hide up\naround her shoulders then tottered towards the water, crunching shingle\nsharp between her bare toes. It was that cold it surely should’ve frozen. But\nit’s better to do it than live with the fear of it, as her father occasionally told\nher, so she sloshed out, wincing and shivering, ripples catching the peaceful\ntrees, and the still mountains, and shattering them into dancing fragments.\n“Chilly as winter’s arse,” she gasped as she wobbled up next to the\nwoman. From the side she looked about normal. Old and deep-lined, cool\nblue eyes fixed on the horizon.\n“The cold has a wonderful way of clearing the mind.” Not the witchy\ncroak Rikke had expected. A young voice, smooth and full of music. “It\nfixes you on what counts. Draws your attention inwards.”\n“So… you do it to gather your magic… or something?”\n“I do it because fools rarely follow a woman into cold water with their\nproblems.” She turned, and Rikke could only stare, because her face was"

        "text": "“So… you do it to gather your magic… or something?”\n“I do it because fools rarely follow a woman into cold water with their\nproblems.” She turned, and Rikke could only stare, because her face was\njust the way she’d seen it in her vision.\nA great pink-grey scar ran down the centre of her buckled forehead,\nfrom hairline to mouth, one eye and one brow higher than the other, as\nthough her skull had been entirely split and set back together by a drunken\nsurgeon. There was a crazy zigzag of stitches through the puckered skin.\nStitches of golden wire that gleamed in the morning sun.\n“I am Caurib,” she said, in that soft, soft voice. “Or I was. A sorceress,\nfrom the utmost North. Or I was. Now I am the witch of the forbidden\nlake.” She turned back to the horizon. “I find that suits me better.”\nRikke had grown up in the North where a man with no scars was no man\nat all, but she never before saw a scar the like of this. She looked down at\nthe water, already settling around her own sharp shin bones and holding a\ndark reflection of herself. “What happened to you?”\n“An axe happened, as axes do.”\n“Didn’t see it coming, then?”\nCaurib slowly raised one brow. Looked like it took some effort, skin\nstretching around the stitches. “I do not need to tell you that the Long Eye\ncomes when it comes. If you are hoping it will keep you safe from all life’s\naxes, you will be disappointed. But then it is the fate of hope to end in\ndisappointment, as it is the fate of light to end in darkness and life in death.\nThey are still worth something while they last.”\nRikke wiggled her numb toes and watched the ripples spread. “Bit of a\nbleak message.”\n“If you sought optimism from a hermit whose head is stitched together\nwith golden wire then you are a bigger fool even than you look. Which\nwould be quite an achievement.”\nRikke stole a glance sideways, but Caurib was looking ahead again. “I\nthought what I saw in the visions, the golden wire, might be, you know…”\n“I do not know. Try saying the words.”\n“A metaphor?”\n“For what?”\n“I just see the visions, I don’t understand them.”\nThe witch gave a hiss of disgust. “It is not the seer’s task to understand\nher visions, girl, any more than it is the potter’s task to understand her\nclay.”\n“I’m guessing…” Rikke winced as she tried to shift her foot on the\nslippery lake bed and caught her toe on a pointed rock. “We’re not actually\ntalking about pots now? Or are we talking about pots now?”\nThe witch gave a hiss of disappointment. “It is the potter’s task to\nimpose her will upon the clay. To shape the clay into something useful. Or\nsomething beautiful.”\n“So… I have to impose my will upon my visions? Shape them into\nsomething beautiful?”\n“Ah! A ray of sunshine penetrates the long night of your ignorance.” The\nwitch gave a hiss of scorn. She could do a lot with a hiss. “And I only had\nto waste half my morning explaining it to you.”\n“But—”"

You want me to give you the rules, but there are no rules. You\nare like those old fools the magi, who want to chain the world with laws.\nYou are like those old fools the Eaters, who want to cage the world with\nprayers. You are like these new fools who want to bind the world with iron\nand make it obey. The Long Eye is magic, girl!” She raised her withered\narms, screaming it towards the mountains. “It is the devil that cannot be\ncaged! It is the demon that breaks all chains!” She let her arms drop. “If\nthere were rules it would not be magic.”\n“Guess I’ll have to find my own answers, then,” said Rikke, mournfully.\nCaurib looked down at her feet, hidden in the lake. “Fear is like cold\nwater. A little is a fine thing, it fixes you on what counts. But too much will\nfreeze you. You must make a box inside your mind, and put your fear\ninside, and lock it.”\n“That sounds a lot like something a mentor would say.”\n“No doubt I’d be a wonderful one. But I’m not yours.”\nRikke heard crunching footsteps behind, turned with a smile thinking to\nsee Shivers or Isern walking down the shore. Instead she saw a Shanka,\ncoming with a lurching gait as it had one leg longer than the other, clawed\nfoot sending a shower of shingle sideways with each step. It had fish\nthreaded onto a spear, one still twisting and flipping, scales glinting silvery\nin the morning sun.\n“Ah!” Caurib smiled, and the great scar through her top lip stretched\nabout the wire in a way Rikke found most unsettling. “Breakfast.”\n“How did you make the Shanka serve you?” asked Rikke as it shoved its\nfish-laden spear point-down near the water’s edge. Her father always talked\nof the flatheads as if they were animals. A plague that couldn’t be reasoned\nwith. And here was one snuffling around for sticks to build a fire like any\nfisherman on the beach. Well, any fisherman with spikes hammered into his\nhead.\n“The same way you make anyone serve you,” said Caurib. “By offering\nthem what they want.”\nRikke watched that flathead grunt and slurp to itself, tongue wedged in\nits great teeth as it carefully stacked twigs on a patch of shingle blackened\nby years of fires. “They’re like people, then?”\n“Oh no.” And Rikke felt Caurib’s hand on her shoulder, light but firm,\nand her soft voice in her ear. “They can be trusted. It is them I have to thank\nfor my life.”\n“What, the Shanka?”\n“Yes. If thanks are appropriate for what hardly seems a life.”\nRikke watched the flathead fumbling with a flint and tinder and juggling\nit all over the beach. “Wouldn’t think they had the fingers for pretty\nstitching.”\n“Does this look pretty to you?”\nRikke cleared her throat and thought it best to say nothing."

They learned that\nmuch from the Master Maker.” And the Shanka bent down, crooked lips\npursed, and coaxed a flame into life with its breath.\n“What happened to the others?” asked Rikke.\n“The man with the steel eye and the woman with the iron temper? They\nsat a while beside you, each pretending to be less worried than the other, but\nafter a few days they tired of fish. Neither would trust the other to hunt so\nthey went off together.”\n“Hold on,” said Rikke. “Days?”\n“Four days you slept. They are good companions. A woman who is to be\ntaken seriously as a seer should have some colourful folk about her.”\n“I didn’t pick ’em for their colour.”\n“No, they picked you, which speaks to your quality and theirs.”\n“Speaks of good quality, or poor?”\nCaurib didn’t answer. Just turned her bright blue eyes on Rikke and said\nnothing. Rikke didn’t much care for being looked at in that way, specially\nnot by a witch, and specially not one with wire through her face.\n“Reckon I’ll eat if you don’t mind sharing your breakfast.” The Shanka\nhad his fish over the fire now and was making quite the mouth-watering\nsmell. First time Rikke felt hungry in weeks, and she rubbed at her aching\nbelly. Not much to rub these days. Her clothes were hanging off her like\nrags off a scarecrow. “When my colourful friends get back we’d best start\nhome. Long way down to Uffrith.”\n“Going so soon?”\nGave Rikke a worried feeling, the way Caurib said it. Like there was an\nunpleasant surprise coming. Pleasant surprises seemed to get rarer as you\ngot older. “Aye, well… I feel better now.” Rikke put her palm a little\nnervously to her left eye. Cool and clammy, just like the other. Just like\nanyone’s. “Whatever you did worked.”\n“I have painted runes about your Long Eye. Runes to keep it caged.”\n“Caged, eh? Grand.” Since she woke, she’d seen no visions of things\npast and no ghosts of things to come. The world looked more ordinary than\nany time since the duel, when she’d forced the Long Eye open. Aside from\nstanding in a magic lake with a woman sent back from the land of the dead\nwhile flatheads cooked breakfast, that was. Rikke took a long breath, puffed\nup her chest and blew it out. “I’m all good.”\n“For now.”\nRikke felt her shoulders sag. “It’ll get worse again?”\n“The runes will fade, and it will get worse again, then worse still. We\nmust paint the runes so they will not fade. We must tattoo them into your\nskin with a crow-bone needle and chain the Long Eye for as long as you\nlive.”\nRikke stared at her. “I thought it was the demon that breaks all chains?”"

With eleven wards and eleven wards reversed,\nand eleven times eleven. A lock strong enough to hold shut the gates of hell\nthemselves.”\n“That… doesn’t sound like something you want on your face.”\n“You should eat. Then you should rest. You should drink plenty of\nwater.”\n“What’s the water for?”\n“One should always drink plenty of water. The tattooing will take\nseveral days. It will be draining for you and even more so for me.”\nRikke brushed her cheek with her fingertips as she watched the smoke\nfrom the cook-fire drift across the lake. She thought of the hillmen, and the\nhillwomen, and those bastards from past the Crinna she’d seen sometimes\nwith their blue painted faces. She gave one of those sorry sighs made her\nlips flap. “There’s just no going back from tattoos on your face, is there?”\n“There has never been any going back for you.” Caurib shrugged.\n“Though you could always leave it, and let the visions get madder and\nmadder until you are sucked into the darkness and your mind bursts apart\ninto a million screaming fragments. That would save me some work.”\n“Thanks for that option.” Rikke felt a bit teary, had to sniff back hard.\nBut it’s better to do it than live with the fear of it, and all that. “Reckon I’ll\ngo for the tattoos, then. If that’ll fix it.”\nThe witch gave a hiss of impatience. “Nothing is ever fixed. From the\nmoment it is born, from the moment it is built, everything is always dying,\ndecaying, drifting into chaos.”\n“I could stand a mite less philosophising and a couple of actual answers\nin the conversation, if it’s all the same to you.”\n“Look about you, girl. If I had all the answers, do you think I would be\nstanding in a freezing lake with my head stitched together?”\nAnd the witch held up her skirts and sloshed back towards the shore,\nleaving Rikke scared and shivering, up to her calves in the frosty water.\n“Oh!” Caurib had turned back to shout at her. “And if you need to shit,\nmake sure you do it well away from the cave!”\nThe King’s Justice\n“S\npoke to the king myself, at length.” Isher lounged on the front bench as\nif he was in his drawing room. “Orso’s every bit his father’s son.”\n“None too bright.” The Lords’ Round was full, but Barezin hardly\nseemed to care if they were overheard. “And ever so easily led.”\nOpen disdain for not one but two kings felt a mite disloyal to Leo,\nespecially here at the heart of government, attending a trial where a man’s\nlife would hang in the balance. His mother would’ve been most displeased\nto hear it. But then, sooner or later, a man has to stop making everything\nabout pleasing his mother.\n“Last year, outside Valbeck, Crown Prince Orso presided over the\nsummary hanging of two hundred supposed revolutionaries,” said Isher.\n“Without trial or process.”"

Orso set his shoulders in what he hoped was a regal\nbearing, plastered on a smile, realised that was utterly inappropriate to the\noccasion, swapped it for a solemn frown and stepped through.\nIt was far from his first visit to the Lords’ Round, of course. He\nremembered being mildly bored when his father had shown it to him as a\nbuilding site, rather impressed when his father had shown it to him largely\ncompleted, then exceedingly bored when his father had presided over the\nfirst meeting of the Open Council there.\nBut Orso had never seen it from this angle—the way an actor might a\ntheatre. An ill-prepared understudy, in his case, suddenly called on to face\nan audience of hostile critics. The curved benches brimmed with lords and\nproxies, all weighty furs and weighty frowns and weighty chains of office.\nThe original Lords’ Round, the one Bayaz destroyed, had boasted only the\none public gallery. The architects of the replacement had clearly felt a\nspeaker might not be sufficiently overawed, so they had added another\nabove. Both were now crammed to the rails with brightly dressed\nonlookers, frothing with anticipation at the delicious prospect of a\nstranger’s downfall.\nThere could easily have been a thousand in attendance. There could\neasily have been more. All kneeling or sunk into curtsies at his approach, of\ncourse. But the aristocracy of the Union could kneel and radiate contempt\nsimultaneously. They had centuries of practice at it.\n“Bloody hell,” he murmured under his breath. He could have sworn that\nby some acoustic sorcery, it was carried about the entire vast chamber and\nechoed back to his ear as he shuffled across that lonely expanse of tiles to\nthe High Table, dragging a mighty weight of cloth of gold cloak behind\nhim.\nBloody hell, bloody hell, bloody hell…\nHe flinched as he felt hands reaching around his neck, but it was only\nGorst, unfastening the golden clasp and whisking the royal vestment away,\nwhile one of his legion of footmen did the same with the crown. Orso\nwasn’t even sure he knew the man’s name. He wasn’t even sure he had a\nname.\nBloody hell, bloody hell, bloody hell…\nOrso cleared his throat as he sank into the great gilded chair, had a\nmomentary panic as he wondered whether he should have been sitting\nsomewhere else, then reminded himself that, however improbable it felt, he\nwas king. He always got the biggest chair.\n“All rise!” bellowed the announcer, making him startle.\nThere was a rustling wave through the crescents of benches as lords took\ntheir seats, a muttering and whispering and grumbling as they discussed the\nforthcoming business. Clerks dumped monstrous ledgers at either end of the\ntable and heaved them thumping open. High Justice Bruckel took his seat\non one side of Orso. Arch Lector Glokta was wheeled into place on the\nother and gave the great collection of lords and their proxies a suspicious\nglare.\n“What’s Isher doing over there?” he murmured.\nAs one of the foremost of Midderland’s old nobility, he should have"

Intimate\nfriends?”\n“Or close conspirators.” Glokta nodded to the announcer, who lifted his\nstaff and struck it on the tiles, filling the hall with crashing echoes.\n“I call this meeting of the Open Council of the Union…” The announcer\nlet it hang there as the noise gradually faded into weighty silence. “To\norder!”\n“Good morning, my lords and ladies!” Orso gave a smile that felt more\nlike the accused trying to ingratiate himself with the judge than the judge\nhimself. “It is my honour to preside over this meeting. We have only one\nitem of business today—”\n“Your Majesty, if I may?”\n“The Open Council recognises Fedor dan Isher!” thundered the\nannouncer.\nAn instant interruption was the last thing Orso wanted, but he had to\nstart as he meant to continue, generous and easy-tempered. Perhaps this was\nall part of Isher’s plan to bring monarch and nobility together, after all. “Of\ncourse, Lord Isher, proceed.”\nIsher pranced from his bench onto the tiled floor like a man stepping\nfrom his favourite chair to give his fire a poke, the echoes of his highly\npolished boots snapping in the vast domed space above.\n“Before we turn to today’s… sorry work, I hope my esteemed\ncolleagues of the Open Council can join me for a moment in some happier\nbusiness.”\nGlokta leaned towards Orso to mutter, “Here’s a bastard who loves the\nsound of his own voice.”\n“I wish to congratulate one of the most celebrated of our number, His\nGrace Leonault dan Brock, the Lord Governor—and, if I may say, the\nundoubted saviour—of Angland… on his forthcoming marriage!”\nAn excited muttering swept the Lords’ Round. There could be few more\neligible bachelors in the Circle of the World, after all. Perhaps King Jappo\nmon Rogont Murcatto of Styria, although rumour had it he preferred swords\nto sheaths, as it were. Perhaps Orso himself, though his romantic reputation,\nadmittedly, was less than glowing. But the dashing young Lord Governor of\nAngland would be right up there on the wishlist of any ambitious young\nheiress. It was a roster with which Orso, thanks to his mother’s constant\nquest for a bride, had more than a passing familiarity. He wondered\nabsently which one of them had staged the coup.\n“To none other…” Isher gestured towards the lower public gallery, lords\ntwisting around on their benches to peer upwards. And there she was, sitting\nat the rail. There was no mistaking that poise, that elegance, that offhand\npride. Orso could have sworn she was looking straight at him. But perhaps\nhe was only desperate that she would. “Than Lady Savine dan Glokta!”"

        "text": "pride. Orso could have sworn she was looking straight at him. But perhaps\nhe was only desperate that she would. “Than Lady Savine dan Glokta!”\nIt was not like being stabbed in the heart. It was much more gradual. An\nodd shock, first. Some mistake, surely? Then, as the clapping began, a\nspreading realisation, cold as the grave. It was like having one great stone\nafter another loaded upon his chest.\nHer refusal had left no room for doubt, but Orso had not realised until\nthat moment how hard he had been hoping. As a marooned sailor hopes for\nrescue. Now, even for a man as unrealistic as he was, hope was suddenly\nsnuffed out.\nThe whole chamber was filled with thunderous applause. The high\njustice was leaning across him to congratulate the Arch Lector. Orso\nbecame aware he was clapping himself. A limp-wristed flapping that made\nalmost no noise at all. Clapping at his own funeral. Down on the front row,\nlords had clustered around an awkward-looking Leo dan Brock to slap him\non the back.\nThere was no excuse for it, he knew. They had been involved, once, on a\ncasual basis. She had given him a great deal of money and he had come by\na roundabout route to her rescue. He had somehow convinced himself that\nthey loved each other and she had sharply disabused him of the notion. It\nreally should have come as no great surprise that she had chosen someone\nelse.\nSo why did he feel so utterly betrayed?\nIt was surely a triumph.\nWith one deft move, Savine had catapulted herself back to the very\nsummit of the endlessly subsiding slag heap that was Union society. Those\nwho had sneered at her with smug scorn, with self-righteous condescension,\neven with infuriating pity, those who had written her off as yesterday’s\nwoman, all gaped at her now in stunned envy. Perhaps they would never\nkneel to her and whisper, “Your August Majesty,” but they would have no\nchoice but to bow and say, “Your Grace.”\nIn the parlours of Adua, the ladies would wonder how Savine dan\nGlokta, well past her most marriageable age, had snared the Young Lion,\nand they would whisper the kind of unkind rumours one only whispers\nabout people too important to ignore.\nIt was a triumph, and after the misfortunes, the reverses, not to mention\nthe life-threatening horrors of the previous few months, it was one she\nsorely needed. She should have been revelling in the attention. Relishing\nthe jealousy of her many enemies. Letting the world see just a hint of her\nself-satisfied smirk over her fan.\nBut she did not care at all for the manner of the announcement. She had\nsupposed that her engagement would be a matter of supreme indifference to\nOrso, but the intensity of the look he had given her told a different story.\nShe wished she could somehow have let him know about it sooner. And she\ncould not have trusted the self-appointed announcer less. Lord Isher was\nentirely too pleased with himself, too friendly with her husband-to-be and\ntoo willing to share the glory of his wedding with them. As he smiled up\ntowards her and gave a flourishing bow, she did not reckon him a man to\ngive anything away."

As he smiled up\ntowards her and gave a flourishing bow, she did not reckon him a man to\ngive anything away.\nThat and, a few chairs further down the gallery, Lady Wetterlant was\nglaring at her with unconcealed hatred. Clearly, it was not a happy day for\neveryone.\nBut it was a triumph. Savine would be damned if she did not at least\nlook like she was enjoying it.\nSo she ignored Lady Wetterlant, simpered at the envious crowds with\ngirlish innocence, blew a kiss down to her embarrassed husband-to-be and\nwondered what the hell that snake Isher was up to.\n“Are you sure about this, Your Majesty?” murmured Glokta. “We could\npostpone.”\n“Delay,” offered Bruckel, from the other side. “Always popular.”\nAs the good wishes for the marriage of the year faded, Orso did his best\nto tear his thoughts away from Savine and back to the pressing business at\nhand—three hundred or so of the most powerful and privileged noblemen in\nthe land, accustomed to seeing the king and his Closed Council as their\nadversaries.\nIf Isher had filled the Lords’ Round with friends, they were hiding their\nwarm feelings towards him remarkably well. But if he postponed now, he\nwould look a coward and a ditherer. He would confirm all the worst things\nthey said about him. All the worst things he thought about himself.\n“It’s all arranged,” he grunted. Wetterlant would confess and beg for\nclemency, and Orso would offer a life sentence and look merciful as well as\nauthoritative. Old enmities would be put aside and the Union could take a\ncollective step towards a better politics, just as Isher had promised. “Let’s\nget this over with.”\n“Bring in the accused!” barked Glokta.\nA side door was flung open with an echoing bang. There was a rustling\nas lords and proxies twisted to see, people in both public galleries leaning\nout dangerously far in their eagerness to glimpse the prisoner. The hall fell\nquiet. There was a scraping, tapping, clinking sound, and Fedor dan\nWetterlant emerged from the darkness.\nAt first, Orso barely recognised the man. He had abandoned his fine\nclothes and dressed in penitent’s sackcloth. He had shaved off his curls and\nlooked wan and hungry. One side of his face was badly bruised, scattered\nwith fresh scabs. He wore only the lightest of chains, but he walked so as to\nmake them rattle as loudly as possible. The pampered fop Orso had met in\nthe House of Questions had transformed into an abused martyr. There was a\ncollective gasp at the sight of him, then a shriek of rage from the public\ngallery. Looking up, Orso saw Lady Wetterlant standing at the rail, white\nwith fury. There was a gradually increasing grumble from the lords and an\never-more-excited murmur from the onlookers as her son shuffled out\nbefore them.\n“What the shit?” hissed Orso through gritted teeth.\n“What did I tell you?” whispered Isher in Leo’s ear. “Next, one of the old\nleeches will offer a false confession as though that closes the case.

You’ll\nsee what passes for the king’s justice these days.”\n“Your Majesty!” someone shouted from near the back. “I most strongly\nprotest!”\n“This man has been tortured!”\n“To treat a member of the Open Council in this manner…”\nThe announcer struck his staff for order but couldn’t stem the mounting\nanger as Wetterlant was herded out onto the floor before the High Table.\nHeugen shook his fist towards Glokta. “Your Eminence, I am\ndisgusted!”\n“To disgusting people I readily confess,” drawled the Arch Lector, “but\nany fool can see I did not torture this man. He looks far too pleased with\nhimself.”\n“Why is no one doing anything?” muttered Leo, gripping his throbbing\nthigh as he sat forward.\n“Order, my lords! Order!” bellowed the announcer. If the atmosphere had\nbeen hostile when Orso arrived, it was rapidly swinging towards outright\nrebellion. He had an unpleasant sensation that the wheels were already\ncoming off his plan as it careered down a steep slope at high speed, and by\nno means towards a better politics. But he could hardly disembark now.\nHigh Justice Bruckel sat forward, clearing his throat. “Fedor dan\nWetterlant! You stand accused. Most serious crimes.” The wattle beneath\nhis chin wobbled as he fired off phrases, the clerks’ pens scratching\ndesperately as they struggled to record them for posterity. “As a member of\nthe Open Council. You have requested and now receive. In the sight of your\npeers. The king’s justice. How do you plead?”\nWetterlant swallowed. Orso caught him glance up towards his mother.\nShe gave him the faintest nod in return, her jaw clenched. A reassurance,\nperhaps. A nudge in the right direction. An urging to make the agreed-upon\nconfession and take his agreed-upon punishment and—\n“I am innocent!” shrieked Wetterlant in ringing tones. A collective gasp\nfrom the public gallery. “I have been dreadfully wronged! Fearfully abused!\nI am innocent of all charges!”\nThe hall erupted more angrily than ever.\n“That fucker,” hissed Orso as he stared at Wetterlant. “That fucker.” He\nlooked to his supposed new best friend in the Open Council, but Isher had\nbrows raised and palms helplessly spread, as if to say, I’m as astonished as\nanyone.\nIn one moment, Orso’s carefully laid plans went up in flames and his\nhopes for a better politics sank into the depths. Now he realised why his\nfather had always despised this place.\n“Oh. Dear,” murmured Bruckel. Uselessly.\nLeo had never seen so clear an injustice. He sat with his jaw hanging open.\n“Are we to hear no evidence?” called out Heugen.\n“Will there be no witnesses?” shouted Barezin, thumping a fat fist into a\nfat palm.\n“Witnesses have been presented. Exhaustively interviewed.” High\nJustice Bruckel struggled to make himself heard over the anger. “The\nClosed Council is satisfied!”"

Exhaustively interviewed.” High\nJustice Bruckel struggled to make himself heard over the anger. “The\nClosed Council is satisfied!”\nUnsurprisingly, that satisfied no one, and Wetterlant’s mother was the\nleast satisfied of all. “I demand justice for my son!” she screamed from the\nbalcony. “The king’s justice!”\nGlokta held up a sheet of parchment, an illegible scrawl at the bottom.\n“The accused has confessed! In full!”\n“I was forced!” wailed the accused.\n“Shut him up!” snapped Bruckel, and Wetterlant cringed as the two\nPracticals turned on him.\n“There is no need to waste more of the Open Council’s time!” shouted\nGlokta.\n“Waste our time?” whispered Leo. Isher had brows raised and palms\nhelplessly spread, as if to say, What did I tell you? Behind him, in one of the\ngreat stained-glass panels, the Open Council rose up united against the\ntyranny of Morlic the Mad, and all because Arnault had the courage to stand\nfirst, alone.\n“Waste our time?” said Leo. Everyone else on the Open Council might\nbe too craven to say what they could all see, but the Young Lion was no\ncoward.\n“Waste our time?” shouted Leo, lurching to his feet. Damn it, his leg\nhurt. It was as if he were being stabbed again and he almost fell, had to\nclutch the back of the bench to steady himself as the announcer struck his\nstaff on the floor for order.\n“The Open Council recognises—”\n“They know who I bloody am! This…” Leo floundered for words.\nEveryone was staring at him. Everyone in the whole great chamber. But this\nhad to be done. For his father. For his country. “This is a disgrace!”\n“What is he doing?” muttered Savine. Ladies were stuck to the rail all\naround her, staring down, eyes bright, fans fluttering like excited butterflies.\nBetter drama than the theatre and all free of charge.\n“I’m no lawyer!” called Leo, his Angland accent sounding particularly\npronounced. “But… even I can tell this is a travesty.”\nSavine watched with growing horror. A man who knows he is no lawyer\nshould also know to keep his bloody mouth shut during a trial. But the\nYoung Lion was not a man to keep his mouth shut.\n“My father,” he bellowed, in an ever angrier and more broken voice,\n“always told me Union justice was the envy of the world!”\nOrso frowned up towards the public gallery, looking angrier than Savine\nhad ever seen him. She shrank back from the rail, wondering whether her\nown history with the two men might be aggravating things. But the Young\nLion was aggravating enough without her help.\n“My friends, I’m horrified. In the Lords’ Round, of all places.\nConfessions got by torture? Is this Union justice or Gurkish tyranny?\nStyrian trickery? Northern savagery?”\n“Yes!” she heard Lady Wetterlant hiss with fierce delight. There were\nloud shouts of agreement from the lords.

Isher shrank silently into his seat, lips pressed carefully\ntogether, making sure there was as much empty bench between him and Leo\nas possible.\n“I would caution the Lord Governor to choose his next words carefully,”\ngrowled Savine’s father, and she found herself in total agreement. A\nrepresentative from the Angland delegation was plucking at the hem of\nLeo’s jacket in an effort to pull him down, but Leo angrily slapped his hand\naway.\n“Sit down, you bloody fool,” Savine forced through gritted teeth,\ngripping the rail of the gallery. But the Young Lion would not sit down.\n“Call yourself a high justice?” he roared at Bruckel, leaning on the back\nof his bench with one hand and gripping hard at his thigh with the other.\n“This isn’t justice!”\n“Your Grace,” growled Orso, “I would ask you to return to your seat—”\n“I refuse!” snarled Leo, spit flying. “It’s plain to everyone that you can’t\njudge this man fairly! You’re a puppet of the Closed Council!”\nYou could almost see the jaws drop. A lady clapped a hand over her\nmouth. Another gasped. Another gave a kind of disbelieving giggle.\n“Oh no,” whispered Savine.\nOrso had always thought himself the most easy-going man in the Union. He\nhad floated over the scornful glances, the frequent insults, the scurrilous\nrumours. Most of them had, after all, been more or less fair. He’d never\nimagined he even really had a temper.\nBut perhaps he’d never before had anything to be angry about.\nWhether it was the ongoing frustration of the throne, the entrenched\nhostility of everyone in the chamber, Wetterlant’s barefaced gall, Isher’s\ntwo-faced chicanery, Brock’s naïve impudence or Savine’s forthcoming\nnuptials that infuriated him most, the combination produced a feeling of\nutter rage such as he had never felt in his life.\n“Colonel Gorst,” he managed to choke out, his throat so tight he could\nhardly form the words. “Remove Lord Brock from the chamber.”\nGorst had no expression on his slab of a face as he pounded across the tiled\nfloor towards Leo.\nThe Open Council didn’t rise united, as they had to support Arnault in\nthe legend. Maybe he’d spoken better than Leo. Or Morlic had been madder\nthan Orso. Or men’s principles had become so greasy, they tended to slip\nfrom their grasp at the worst moments. Or maybe the legend was balls.\nEveryone stared, but not one arse left its seat.\nLeo took a shuffling step back and nearly fell onto his bench, grimacing\nat the stab of pain in his leg. “Now, hold on a—”\nGorst caught two fistfuls of Leo’s jacket.\nOnce, as a boy, he’d gone swimming in the sea near Uffrith and been\ntaken by a sudden swell and dragged off his feet. He’d thrashed with all his\nstrength, but the current had sucked him helpless over rocks, swept away by\na force of nature far greater than he would ever be."

It felt as if he could’ve flung Leo from the\nchamber with one throw. He marched him up the aisle of the Lords’ Round,\nthrough the coloured splashes of light, past gaping lords, Leo’s feet kicking\nuselessly at the steps, tangled with his badly balanced commemorative\nsword.\n“I’m going!” squawked Leo. “I’m going!”\nBut he might as well have complained to the tide. Gorst showed no\nemotion as he bundled Leo from the hall, across the antechamber, then out\nof the Lords’ Round into the daylight. He finally set Leo down with\nexaggerated care beside a statue of Casamir the Steadfast, feeling much the\nsame sense of awe and relief as he had when the sea finally washed him up\non that beach near Uffrith as a boy, but with an added helping of crippling\nembarrassment.\nGorst wasn’t even out of breath. “I hope you realise…” he squeaked,\n“that this was not personal, Your Grace.” He gave an awkward smile.\n“Please… pass my respects to your mother.”\n“What?” muttered Leo, but Gorst was already striding back up the steps.\nThe doors were were shut on the Young Lion with a crash, and silence\npressed in.\n“Enough of this pantomime!” snarled Orso. The legs of his gilded chair\ngave a tortured shriek as he stood, obliging everyone in the chamber to\nwobble uncertainly onto their knees. He turned towards Wetterlant.\n“I find you guilty of rape and murder,” he said, in the same icy tone his\nown mother might have used.\n“But…” Wetterlant stared over at Isher, as though this was not at all\nwhat he had been expecting, but Isher had folded his arms and was meeting\nno one’s eye. “I am a member of the Open Council—”\n“The members of this exalted body must be exemplars,” snapped Orso,\nglowering at the silent lords, “held to higher standards, not lower, and\nsubject to the same justice as any other man. The king’s justice. My justice.”\nAnd he stabbed at his chest with a finger. “There is no question in my mind\nof your guilt. I have given you every chance to show remorse and you have\nslapped my hand away. I therefore sentence you to death by hanging. Take\nhim down.”\n“No!” shrieked Lady Wetterlant from above.\n“You can’t do this!” her son wailed as he was dragged away. “I’m an\ninnocent man! I was compelled!” He screeched over his shoulder, bucking\nand twisting, “Isher! Mother! You can’t let them do this!”\n“Get rid of him,” hissed Glokta, and the Practicals bundled him through\nthe side door and flung it shut with an echoing bang.\n“You’ll pay for this!” Lady Wetterlant was screaming. “I’ll see you pay!\nEvery one of you!

That was—”\n“Don’t!” snapped Orso.\nThey walked in silence, one of the wheels of Glokta’s chair catching on\nevery turn with a regular squeak, squeak, squeak which might as well have\nbeen a saw applied directly to Orso’s nerves.\nHe wished he had some honest men beside him. He wished he could\nhave given Malmer a seat on the Closed Council. But he had hanged\nMalmer, and two hundred others, and fully earned the scorn and distrust of\nevery commoner in Midderland. Now, in trying to find a compromise, he\nhad somehow made enemies of the entire nobility, too, with the Union’s\nmost celebrated hero foremost among them.\nAnd that was without even touching on the man’s forthcoming marriage\nto the woman Orso quite evidently still loved.\n“What a fucking disaster!” he snarled.\nThe high justice tried to smile but it ended up a wince. “I suppose… It\ncould have been… worse?”\n“How, exactly?”\nThe Arch Lector raised one brow. “Well, nothing’s on fire.”\nSavine hurried down the steps as fast as her shoes would allow.\n“Leo!” she called.\nGorst had left him upright, at least, for all he was leaning against a\nstatue’s pedestal, face twisted with evident pain and his jacket in some\ndisarray.\n“What the hell were you thinking, you thick shit?” was what she was\nburning to ask, but instead she stuffed her voice with concern. “Are you\nhurt?”\n“Hurt?

She should have been parading the square\nlike a peacock.

His is the only side that counts!\nHe cannot allow himself to be defied before the foremost noblemen of the\nland. Men have ended up in the House of Questions for less.”\nHe stared at her, breathing hard. Then suddenly all the defiance drained\nout of him. “Shit. You’re right.”\n“Of course,” was what she wanted to say, but she kept her silence, and\ntidied a loose strand of hair behind his ear, and let him get there by himself.\n“Shit.” He closed his eyes, utterly dismayed. “I’ve made myself look a\nfool.”\nShe turned his face back towards her again. “You have made yourself\nlook passionate, and principled, and brave.” And an utter fool, it hardly\nneeded saying. “All the qualities people admire in you. All the qualities I\nadmire in you.”\n“I’ve offended the king.

He\nlooked around, a bit offended, a bit scared, but not half as scared as she was\nnow.\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. By the dead, her head was hurting, jabbing\nin her face, jab, jab, jab.\n“Keep it, and I see for you a great destiny. A great destiny. Or give it\naway. And be Rikke. Have a life. Push out children and teach them songs.”\nCaurib shrugged as she sucked fish off the bones, and the wind blew up and\nmade sparks shower from the fire, down the shingle and out over the black\nwater. “Cook porridge and spin and sit in your father’s garden and watch\nthe sun go down. Do whatever it is ordinary folk do these days.”\n“They do what they always do,” said Shivers. “They die.”\nIsern gripped her shoulder. “You must choose. You must choose now.”\nPain stabbed through her head and Rikke screamed, screamed so hard\nher voice cracked and became a breathy wheeze. A long-drawn rattle. A\nlaugh. Stour Nightfall’s laugh, wet eyes on her as he grinned at the\naudience, dancing, mocking, and a golden snake was coiled around him.\n“Break what they love!” And his sword left a bright smear. A thousand\nbright smears. She knew where it would be, always. She knew the sword\nand the arrow, too. She knew too much. The crack yawned wide in the sky\nand she squeezed her eyes shut. All she could hear was the clashing of steel."

All she could hear was the clashing of steel.\nA thunder of voices and hooves and metal and fury.\nShe opened her eyes and, by the dead, a battle. A battle at night, but lit\nby fires so bright it looked like day. Or was it smoke? Broken pillars like\nbroken teeth. A lion torn by the wind, ragged and stained. And a sun on a\nbroken tower.\nThere was a flash like lightning, a noise like thunder, and men were\nripped apart, horses flung like toys. She sank down in terror, sank among\nthe corpses and the stomping boots and spraying mud and squeezed her\neyes tight shut.\n“It’s already over,” said a strange, high voice. “It couldn’t be more\nover.”\nStrong arms forced her down into the dirt and she kicked and struggled\nand fought with everything she had but it wasn’t enough.\n“Hold her! By the dead, hold her still!”\nSomething pressed across her chest. Pressed so hard she could scarcely\nbreathe, iron fingers tight across her forehead, pinprick lights burning at her.\nBright lights like blazing stars in a midnight sky.\n“How much did I drink?” she croaked out.\n“All of it, I think,” said Orso, putting down the tray. Or was it Leo? “I\nbrought you an egg.”\nShe lifted her chin a little to give him the eye. But the left eye or the\nright, she wasn’t sure. “Lay it yourself, did you?”\nLeo smiled. Or Orso did.\n“I miss you,” said Rikke. Said it to both of them. But she wasn’t sure\nwhether she missed them, or she missed who she’d been when she was with\nthem. The Rikke who’d laughed and kissed and fucked and not had to\nchoose.\nHer face was burning. The left side of her head throbbing. Stink of herbs\non the brazier, sickly sweet, so strong she could hardly breathe for it. A\nlong, low crooning. A song in a tongue she didn’t know.\n“She’s no better, witch!”\n“I made no promises.”\n“She’s worse!”\n“Her Long Eye is stronger than I have ever seen. It fights to be free.\nHear me, girl.” Caurib’s voice boomed and echoed as if from a long way\noff. Something slapped at her and she grunted and grumbled. “Have you\never seen a thing entire? Through time? Have you known a thing\ncompletely?”\n“An arrow,” croaked Rikke, stirring her thick tongue in her thick lips.\n“From its making to its end. When it flew, I pushed it away with my finger.\nAnd a sword. And a crack in the sky.”\n“What was inside?”\n“Everything.”\nShe heard Caurib give a long, rustling sigh. “It’s worse than I feared. Or\nbetter than I hoped. The wards will not be enough. We must go further.”\n“Speak another riddle,” snarled Shivers, “and I will split your head in so\nmany pieces no stitching will hold the shreds together.”\nHard fingers gripped Rikke’s face, pulled her eyelids open, golden wire\nblurry in the tricking candlelight."

But she was not\nin a cave but her father’s hall. Burning thatch dropped from the burning\nrafters. Screams outside the doorway.\nShe saw people at the top of a high tower beneath a bloody sunset. A\nline of them. A queue of them. One by one they fell. One by one they hit the\nground beneath, tap, tap, tap.\nTap, tap of the needle dipped in the ink, the needle so white and the ink\nso black, white as snow, black as coal, and Caurib’s soft singing and the\nsmell of sweat and spice and sickly sweet herbs burning on the brazier. Tap,\ntap. Someone held her hand. Held her hand tight and Rikke squeezed it\nback.\n“I’m sorry,” came a whispering, choking voice, breath hot on her ear.\n“But it must be done.”\nA burning pain in her cheek and she snapped and snarled but could not\nmove even a hair’s breadth. Stabbing, stabbing in her face, around her\nburning eye, and men spilled over a snow-patched hill, an army, while\nshadows swarmed across the land from the racing clouds above.\n“Yes. Hold her tight. Calm, now, calm.”\nShe stood upon a wharf, rain falling, clothes clammy on her, and a ship\nrocked and tossed on the unquiet sea, shields on its top strake battle-scarred,\noars struggling like the legs of a woodlouse tipped over as it crawled closer.\n“Time to settle some scores,” said the Nail, all shoulders and elbows and\nfierce grin, and behind his back he held a knife.\n“Scores have to be settled,” said Shivers, grey hair plastered to his\nscarred face with the rain. “But don’t expect it to feel good.” And he\ncharged towards a gate, and men charged after him, their boots hammering\non a wooden bridge, tap, tap, tap.\nTap, tap. Like nails hammered into her forehead and she gasped and\ntwisted and spat.\n“I can’t stand it!” she whimpered. “Let me up, I can’t stand it!”\n“You can and you will.”\nThe bench had ropes around it. And on the polished-smooth cave floor\nsalt had been scattered. Circles and lines and symbols in salt. Candles\nburning in the darkness. A joke of a witch’s cave.\n“Here is your couch, girl,” said Caurib.\n“Looks like a joke,” whispered Rikke as she walked towards it, stone\ncold under her bare feet.\n“You will not be laughing.”\nClip, clip, and the hair scattered across her bare feet.\n“Fucking a crown prince is no great distinction,” Orso laughed. “But\nbeing brought breakfast by one…”\nShe closed her eyes, strained up towards him and he kissed her lids,\nkissed her forehead, kissed her cheek, and his kisses became a numb\npressing, then a sharp jabbing, then a brutal stabbing, and she growled and"

Steaming waves on the shore. Footprints,\nburning footprints in the shingle.\n“Hold her, then, she’s twisting like a salmon!”\n“I am bloody holding her.”\n“This is fine work. It must be fine work.”\nThe bench hard against her hard shoulder blades and her body rigid and\ntrembling and the jab, jab, jabbing at her face, and she could see a wagon\nmade of bones, rattling along behind skeleton horses. She heard Caurib\nclicking her tongue.\n“That one is done. That one will hold.”\nHiss of more herbs on the brazier and her face stung and sweated and\nstung and she was so thirsty, so thirsty, her eye burned. A wolf ate the sun\nand a lion ate the wolf and a lamb ate the lion and an owl ate the lamb.\n“By the dead, it hurts,” she croaked.\n“Did she speak?”\n“She said it hurts.”\n“You can tell that just by looking, d’you see?”\n“Shut up and light that candle.”\n“Why did I ever trust you?”\nOld men gathered around a bed. A deathbed. A dead king, and her eye\nburned.\n“Hang a hide in the mouth of the cave to keep the wind out. Now!”\nA woman stood on a high wall. A terrible woman holding a terrible\nknife. A man leaned beside her on the stones, and she smiled as she raised\nthe blade. “Break what they love,” she said, merciless, ruthless, and Rikke\nscreamed as the needle jabbed at her face, merciless, ruthless.\n“Send him down, then.”\n“I’ve changed my mind!” she screeched, slobbering, desperate, eyes\nfixed on the needle, trying to twist away.\n“Too late now, girl.”\nShe sat down beside Shivers, frowned across the fire at the Shanka,\ngathered in a half-circle, light dancing in their black eyes. One got up, and\nShivers reached for his sword, but all it did was sprinkle salt on the cooking\nfish. A little flick of salt, with a neat flick of its crooked wrist.\n“I can’t tell what’s real and what’s a vision,” Rikke heard herself say. “I\ncan’t tell what’s then and what’s to come. It all runs together like paints in\nthe water.”\nShe gasped at another stabbing twinge through her eye. Gasped, and\nretched, but there was nothing to come up. Felt like she’d puked out\neverything she’d ever eaten. Everything anyone had ever eaten. A great\nbuilding burned. A high dome crumbled inwards, sparks showering into the\nsky, showering down the shingle.\n“You must make of your heart a stone,” said Isern.\nCandle flames glinted in Shivers’ metal eye. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”\nSo cold around her feet. The lake to her calves. She saw her own\nreflection, a knobbly clipped head against the racing clouds. Turned her face\nthis way and that. Something written there. Eleven wards, and eleven wards\nreversed, and eleven times eleven."

Stillness for a moment. Rikke stared up at them,\nthe cold fear spreading through her.\n“Choose… an eye?”\nLet Ring the Bells\nS\navine studied her face in the mirrors from every angle, no fewer than nine\nmaids fluttering nervously about her: Freid with powder and brush, Metello\nwith comb and scissors, Liddy with a mouthful of pins, May with four\ndifferent colours of thread woven around her fingers. Aside from a wrinkle\nor two about the eyes—and unless great Euz could turn back time for her\nthere was no help for that—she saw no opportunity for improvement.\n“Perfection,” said Zuri, with the quiet pride of a painter placing the last\nbrushstroke on a masterpiece.\n“Hardly.” Savine took one last surreptitious sniff of pearl dust then\ncarefully brushed clean the rims of her nostrils. “But as close as we’ll get\nunder the circumstances.”\nShe had never worked so hard as she had in preparation for this event.\nThere were a great many things that fell short of her standards, but then she\nhad only been given a few days to prepare for seven hundred and fourteen\nguests, and at this particular wedding she was not the only bride.\nIndeed, the thing that fell furthest short of her standards was the other\none.\nIsold dan Kaspa, soon to be Isold dan Isher, was waiting at the vast,\ninlaid doors, breathing faster than an untried soldier about to meet a charge\nof horse. She was very young and rather chinless, with a scattering of\nfreckles across her nose and big, brown eyes that looked constantly on the\npoint of brimming with tears.\n“I… never saw such a dress,” she murmured as Liddy stooped to make\nsome tiny adjustment to Savine’s train.\n“My dear, you’re so kind. But it really was thrown together.” And it had\nbeen, in six days. By two corset-makers, a goldsmith, three dealers in\npearls, an expert in working with them, and nine seamstresses going\nthrough the night by candlelight. “You look magnificent, too.”\nIsold blinked down doubtfully at herself. “Do you think so?”\n“I do.” Savine did not. Isold’s dress was a triumph of optimism over\ntaste and accentuated all her worst features. But its inferiority to her own\nwould be so utterly obvious to anyone watching there was no point in\nsaying so.\n“That’s such an unusual necklace.”\n“Runes.” Savine stretched out her throat as Zuri gave an infinitesimal\ntweak to the way they sat. Everyone here had diamonds, after all, but these\ngave her a dash of the exotic. She was the least superstitious person alive,\nbut they felt like good luck, somehow. “They were a gift from…” An old"

She was the least superstitious person alive,\nbut they felt like good luck, somehow. “They were a gift from…” An old\nlover of my husband’s did not sound quite right, so she settled for, “A friend\nfrom the North.”\n“Will your parents be here?”\nA more complicated question than Isold probably realised, since one of\nSavine’s fathers was dead and the other not actually her father. She settled\nfor, “Both of them.”\n“You’re so lucky. I have hardly any family left. My uncle died before I\nwas born, on campaign in the North, then my father last year, and my\nmother a few months after. I never had any siblings.” Leaving her, no\ndoubt, with quite the inheritance. Savine began to divine what made her so\nirresistible to Lord Isher. “I only wish one of them had lived to see this…”\n“I am sure they would have been proud.” And somewhat relieved to be\nrid of her. Savine took her gently by the shoulders. “Today you will gain a\nwhole new family. I know your husband to be a good man.” She suspected\nhim of being a devious scorpion. “And from the way he talks, he is very\nmuch in love with you.”\nIsold blinked up at her. “Do you think so?”\nSavine did not. “How could it be otherwise?” she asked, chucking Isold\nunder the chin and making her smile. “Zuri, could one of the girls help Isold\nwith her powder?”\n“Blessed is she who gives succour to the needy, Lady Savine…”\n“I’m sorry…” croaked out Isold as May attended to her face, “I don’t\nmean to be a burden—”\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Savine. “I should be the one apologising, for\nstealing half of your big day. And with so little notice. It has been… quite\nthe whirlwind.”\n“It’s good to have someone to share it with.” Isold looked down at her\nshoes. “To take some of the attention.”\n“I understand entirely.” Though there had never been enough attention\nin the Circle of the World to satisfy Savine.\n“The Lords’ Round.” Isold stared at the huge doors. Beyond they could\nhear the vague murmur of the gathering witnesses. Almost as many as had\nwitnessed Wetterlant’s trial. “So many people watching.”\n“Everyone who’s anyone.” Savine had spent several hours poring over\nthe guest list with Zuri and her mother in order to make absolutely sure of\nit.\n“The king is here,” whispered Isold.\nSavine found her nonchalance slipping a little at that. “Yes.”\n“Do you know him?”\n“We… have met. He is a good man, regardless of what you hear.”\n“My husband-to-be doesn’t seem to think so.”\nFor some reason, that caused Savine a stab of anger. “Luckily, I am not\nobliged to agree with Lord Isher.”\n“I am,” said Isold, in a tiny voice.\nBy the Fates, her eyes were already brimming again, making her powder\nrun.

Savine was happy to play big sister but she drew the line at\nmotherhood. She would have her own child to worry about soon enough.\n“You are being married to the man,” she said, less gently now, “not sold\nto him.”\n“I suppose.” Isold took a heavy breath. “I wish I had your… grit.”\nSavine was far from sure that grittiness was the quality most sought for\nin a bride. She took Isold by her limp little hands. “Act as if everything is\ngoing exactly according to your plans. As if you are the most confident\nperson in the world. As if you never had a doubt in your life.” Savine forced\nher shoulders back, her chin up and faced the door. “It works for me.”\n“Does it?” asked Isold. “Really?”\nSavine paused a moment, mouth half-open. Then she slipped the box of\npearl dust from her sleeve and offered it out. “There’s always this.”\n“Ready, my friend?” asked Isher.\nLeo forced a watery smile towards High Justice Bruckel, standing by to\nofficiate, his robes trimmed with so much fur he looked like a giant,\ndisapproving badger. “Can’t wait.”\nLeo had always reckoned himself the bravest man in any company. They\ncalled him the Young Lion, after all. But standing here, on the marble floor\nof the Lords’ Round, well dressed, well fed, well attended and in no danger\nof violent death, he was terrified.\nThere are different kinds of courage, maybe, and the kind that lets you\nfling yourself into a thicket of spears has nothing to do with the kind that\nlets you stand smiling in front of a thousand people and give your life to a\nwoman you hardly know.\nHe wished his friends were there. His real friends. Antaup, with his\nendless chatter about women, and Glaward, with his endless chatter about\nweapons, and Whitewater Jin with his beard and his belly laugh, and good\nold Jurand, most of all. Jurand, with his caution and good sense. Jurand,\nwith his endless patience and support. Jurand, with the fine shape of his jaw,\nand his hair falling in that artless mess, and the perfect definition of his\nlips… Leo shook himself. He even wished he could hear Barniva wax on\nabout the horrors of war one more time but, as if to prove his own point, the\npoor bastard had got himself killed. In a war.\nAnd none of them were invited anyway. There had been no time to send\nfor them. Leo had come to Adua to attend Lord Isher’s wedding and make\nnew friends. Not to make an enemy of the king and get bloody married\nhimself.\nHe felt another surge of nerves. Could you call it cowardice? He found\nhe was glancing about for some route of escape, more little rabbit than\nYoung Lion. He caught sight of his mother, who gave him an encouraging\nnod.

Finally, King Orso, slouching on his cushions in the\nmiddle of the front row, jaw angrily clenched.\nLeo turned his back on them, mouthing the over-rehearsed apology\nSavine had arranged for him to give later. “Your Majesty, I’m a soldier, not\na courtier. A simple soldier. I can only apologise. I let my passions get the\nbetter of me. No excuse. Will never happen again—”\n“Please rise!” bellowed Bruckel.\nThere was a rustling as the hundreds of witnesses stood, an echoing\nfanfare from the gallery garlanded with spring flowers, and a mighty\ncreaking as the doors were heaved open and the two brides stepped into the\nlight.\nWhenever Leo saw Savine she was somehow more than he remembered,\nbut now, in ten thousand marks or more of Suljuk silk, Osprian lace and\npearls from the distant Thousand Isles, advancing so proudly, so gracefully,\nso dauntlessly down the aisle, he couldn’t take his eyes away.\nNo one could. The future Lady Isher was a simpering little girl by\ncomparison, the blushing maid beside the peerless empress. Savine was\ndoing her best not to outpace her, to hold her hand, to show her off to best\nadvantage, but poor Isold was utterly upstaged at her own wedding.\nIt didn’t help that she appeared to be constantly suppressing an urge to\nsneeze.\nIt was as if all these people were the setting of the ring in which Savine\nwas the jewel. As if the Lords’ Round had been built especially for this\nmoment. Perhaps you can borrow courage from someone else. As Savine\njoined him at the High Table, Leo’s doubts were wiped away. With her at\nhis side, there was nothing he couldn’t do. He was the Young Lion again.\nShe gave him a look up and down, nodded approvingly and raised one\nperfectly plucked brow. “You came, then?”\n“Are you joking?” Leo turned to the high justice and gave him a grin\nworthy of a famous hero. “I wouldn’t miss this for the world.”\nThe spring sun shone on the park, turning every dewdrop to a diamond.\nDappled shade danced on the manicured lawns under trees that had been\nancient in Casamir’s reign. A gentle breeze brought only the slightest\nscratch in the throat from the chimneys that towered over the Agriont on\nevery side. Everything crisp and bright and ready to burst forth with new\npossibilities.\nLady Finree dan Brock and Lady Ardee dan Glokta, mothers to one of\nthe happy couples, glided about the gathering arm in arm, an all-conquering\ndouble act, the one imposing military precision on the serving staff, the\nother administering risqué anecdotes to every guest. So many different\nstyles of laughter. Hearty guffaws and bubbling chuckles from the\ngentlemen. Silvery giggles and tinkling titters from the ladies.\nA truly wonderful time was being had by all.

The dungeons of the\nEmperor of Gurkhul held more appeal at that moment. It was hard to\nimagine greater torture, after all, than the glorious wedding of the woman\nhe loved to a man he decidedly didn’t, where the guests consisted of a range\nof sneering enemies, bowing and scraping to his face then spitting scorn as\nsoon as he was out of earshot.\nWith every day that passed, he was coming to understand, even to\nadmire, his father more. The man had played the eternally losing hand of\nbeing king about as well as was possible.\nHe lifted his glass, and glumly watched the way the sunlight sparkled\nthrough it. The oblivion of the bottle, then. Wine had never let him down.\nMore importantly, he had never let it down.\n“Your Majesty?”\nIt was one of the grooms. Not the one he hated. The one he utterly\ndespised. Lord fucking Isher, even more immaculately polished than usual.\n“I wished to give you my unreserved apology for the events in the Open\nCouncil. I am devastated. Who could have known that Lady Wetterlant\nwould renege on her commitments and turn on us both?”\nOrso had spent a great deal of time pointlessly rehearsing the events of\nthat day and, though he could prove nothing, he strongly suspected Isher\nhad orchestrated the whole thing. To Lady Wetterlant, he blamed Orso; to\nOrso, he blamed Lady Wetterlant; then he teased out Leo dan Brock’s little\nperformance and imagined he would come through greatly empowered and\nstill everybody’s friend.\nThe desire to punch him in the face was almost irresistible. But breaking\nhis treacherous nose in front of several hundred guests, though satisfying\nfor a moment, would only have played into Isher’s hands, and Orso had\ndone that quite enough already. Plainly, Isher thought him an utter fool.\nBetter he keep doing so.\n“You have nothing to apologise for!” Orso tossed his empty glass into\nthe bushes and folded Isher in a tight embrace. “I know you did everything\nyou could. Those bloody Wetterlants stabbed us both in the back.” He held\nIsher at arms’ length and smiled, smiled, smiled. “Some dogs are a danger\nto everyone. Have to be put down for the general good. And you can hardly\nbe blamed for Lord Brock’s outburst.” Although he most certainly could be\nand most certainly was.\n“The man has a soldier’s temperament,” said Isher. “I know how\ndesperately he wants to apologise for his behaviour.”\n“Not everyone is a politician, eh? Heart of a lion, and so forth. It’s a\nshame how things went, but— Ah!”\nAnd Orso snatched two glasses from a passing waiter’s tray and pressed\none into Isher’s hand. “There’s as much need for cooperation between the\nCrown and Open Council as ever. More! I hope we can work together again\nto bring it about. This time… with a happier outcome?” Such as Isher’s\nneck in the noose rather than Wetterlant’s, for example. “To your happiness,\nmy friend, and that of your charming bride, of course!”"

Imported from Gurkhul,\nBroad had been told, at a cost he hardly dared imagine.\nHalf had died on the way over. He’d watched them clean the cages out,\nheaping up the shiny little corpses.\nMay gave a delighted giggle as the survivors twittered sparkling into the\nsky. “Beautiful!”\nThe guests clapped politely, and straight away turned to other\nentertainments. No doubt the birds themselves were meant to loiter in the\ntrees and serenade the newly-weds, but they soon scattered to the wind.\nBroad doubted they’d last long in this climate. Only one was left on the\nlawn, weakly cheeping, looking almost as baffled as Broad felt.\n“How much did it all cost, do you reckon?”\nMay winked at him. She’d held the books, had one eye on the sums, but\nshe treated the number like a beautiful secret rather than a guilty one.\n“Better not to ask.”\nA lot better, probably. But he couldn’t help himself. For what Savine had\nspent on that one dress, which Liddy would help cut her out of in a few\nhours and she’d never wear again, she could’ve paid her workers on the\ncanal more’n they’d asked for, and got the thing dug without one bone\nbroken.\nFor what her father the Arch Lector had spent on the wine today, maybe\nhe could’ve built some better houses in Valbeck, and folk wouldn’t have\nbeen stuck in rotten cellars, and the Breakers wouldn’t have risen up, and\ntwo hundred good people wouldn’t have been hanged.\nFor what Lord fucking Isher had spent on this dinner for seven hundred,\nthe valley Broad grew up in could’ve been left as it was. He could’ve been\nherding now, the way his father had, along with all those others thrown off\ntheir land.\nWas he the only one saw it? Was he the only one worried about it?

They saw, and they worried, but they somehow\ndidn’t fucking do anything.\n“Doesn’t she look beautiful?” murmured Liddy, watching Savine dan\nBrock sweep past with her husband, envious lords and ladies swarming\nafter them like the tail to a comet.\n“Aye,” said Broad, pushing his lenses up his nose. She did look\nbeautiful. Everything looked beautiful. Even them. He’d never seen his wife\nand his daughter look so fine, so well fed, so happy. It’s easy to scream\nabout the fence when you’re on the wrong side of it.

Other\npeople’s sacrifices aren’t that hard to make.\n“All worth it, eh?” said Liddy. She was talking about the nights she’d\nspent stitching by candlelight, he reckoned, not the nights he’d spent\nbeating men by lamplight.\nHad that been worth it?\n“Aye,” he croaked out.\nHe forced the smile onto his face. He was doing that a lot lately.\nLeo sat, watching his wife dance, whirl, twist, smile, flitting effortlessly\nfrom one partner to another. His wife. Just thinking the words gave him a\nguilty thrill. She was an enchanting dancer, it hardly needed to be said.\nLeo would’ve liked to join her and soak up his share of the admiration.\nBut he’d never been much of a dancer, even without the leg wound. Few\nsoldiers are. Antaup, maybe. He wondered what his friends would say when\nhe presented his bride. Speechless, most likely. How could they be anything\nbut impressed? How could anyone?\n“Not dancing, Your Grace?” It was that woman with the red hair and all\nthe bosom he’d met last time he was in Adua.\n“The leg, you know. Still a bit sore.”\n“A shame. I can’t remember such a spectacular wedding.”\n“Thank you…” A moment of horror at not knowing her name, then a\nwash of relief as it came to him. “Selest! So glad you could come.”\n“Oh, Bayaz could have locked me in the House of the Maker and I’d\nstill have found a way to attend!” She tapped him on the chest with her fan.\n“That’s two wonderful shows you’ve put on in the Lords’ Round.”\nLeo winced. “You know about the other one?”\n“My dear, everyone knows about the other one.”\n“Well, I’m meeting the king later this evening. I’ll say sorry, and that’ll\nbe that.”\n“Of course. I suppose there was always going to be some… friction\nbetween you and His Majesty, given his history with your wife.”\nLeo felt a coldness creeping up his spine. “What?”\n“Rumour has it they were lovers,” she purred. “But I’m sure Savine told\nyou. It’s hardly the kind of secret one would want hanging over a marriage,\nafter all.”\nThe music struck a false note, suddenly. Was that why Savine had been\nso worried about the king’s feelings? So keen for Leo to apologise? He felt\na surge of fury, and the pain in his leg as he leaned towards Selest dan\nHeugen only made it worse. He forced the words hissing through his fixed\nsmile. “If I hear you’ve spread that rumour, I’ll break your fucking nose.”\nShe looked rather pleased with that. One of those people who count\nanything but being ignored as a victory. “There’s really no point getting\nangry with me, Your Grace. I didn’t fuck the king.”\nShe left him sitting, watching his wife dance, whirl, twist, smile, flitting\neffortlessly from one partner to another. The sight no longer filled him with\nquite the same delight.\nIt was done. It was done, and could not be undone."

It was done, and could not be undone.\nOrso drained yet another glass, wondering if there was some kind of\ndrinking record he could aim for. Something to give his life purpose.\nSomething more than staring at Savine and thinking about all he’d lost.\nHe glanced over to Brock, who for some reason appeared to be frowning\nangrily back, and raised his empty glass in a pointless toast. That bastard\nwas everything Orso wasn’t. Honest, decisive, likeable. Crushingly popular\nwith both nobles and commoners. A storybook hero with no crowd of\nmistakes at his back. Unless you counted the one he’d made in the Lords’\nRound, the one he was apparently so very keen to apologise for, and that\nonly appeared to have gilded his reputation. Hot-blooded and passionate,\ndon’t you know! Anyone would have thought the most admirable thing a\nman could do in Open Council these days was berate the monarch.\n“Blame sticks to some men,” he murmured, under his breath. “Others it\nslides right off.”\n“Dinner will be served shortly, Your Majesty.” A powdered footman\ngestured towards his chair—the largest chair, of course—in the very centre\nof the great polished horseshoe of table. He wondered how many trees had\ndied to make it possible. “If it please Your Majesty, you are to be seated\nbetween the two brides, the grooms just without, to either side.” And he\nmanaged to back away and bow simultaneously.\nBetween the two brides. As though to emphasise how alone he was. He\nwould rather have been seated between the Great Wolf and the Snake of\nTalins. Far rather. He did not have nearly so ugly a history with them as he\nhad with Savine dan Glokta.\nHe realised he had to correct himself.\nSavine dan Brock.\n“Fuck,” he snarled. He could stand it no longer. He could stand himself\nno longer. “Gorst?”\n“Your Majesty?”\n“Where might we find Corporal Tunny these days?” The Lord Governor\nof bloody Angland could apologise later, if he cared to. “I think I’ve had\nquite enough of other people’s happiness.”\nSavine shut the doors and leaned back against them, taking a moment to\nbreathe. Her cheeks burned from the dancing, and the compliments, and the\nendless smiling, and the ever-greater quantities of pearl dust. She could\nhardly feel her face any more. She simply had to get some air.\n“So. A married woman.” The sight of her father soon cleared her\nspinning head. He sat in his wheeled chair on the terrace, deep-lined face\ntipped back, gazing at the stars. “They say it’s the proudest day of a father’s\nlife.”\n“They say all sorts of nonsense.” His opinion had meant everything to\nher once, but she found right now she hardly cared. She was eager to shrug\noff the wreckage of her past life like a snake sheds its skin and sweep away\nsmiling towards her bright new future.\n“There is no guide to being a parent, Savine.” He turned his head slowly\nto look at her, eyes bright in the darkness. “Especially if your parents did as"

You reel from one mess to\nanother and chart the only course you can see at the time. We meant to tell\nyou the truth, but… when is the right moment to share a thing like that? We\npreferred the pretence. We did not… want to hurt you.”\nShe gave a bitter snort. “Then congratulations on your spectacular\nfailure.”\n“Hardly my first. One day, I hope you will see that we always tried to act\nin your best interests.”\n“You could have warned me.”\n“Not to bed the crown prince? Hardly advice someone of your talents\nshould need.” Perhaps he had a point there. “Besides, we agreed long ago\nthat I would give you some privacy. How was I to know you would become\ninvolved with the one man who was off limits?”\n“From what my mother tells me, it does rather run in the family.”\nA silence, and she saw the side of his face twitch in the warm light from\nthe party, and he reached up and wiped a streak of wet from his leaking left\neye. “Well. A life without regrets is not a life at all. It is in the past now. I\nknow I cast a long shadow, Savine. I am glad you are ready to step out from\nunder it. Just… be careful.”\n“Aren’t I always?”\n“You will move in different circles now. As the Lady Governor of\nAngland, no less.”\n“I’m used to hard decisions.” It felt as if her life had been one after\nanother.\n“You are used to business. This is politics. The way things are going…\nwell, take care. And promise me one thing.” He beckoned her close to\nwhisper. “Have nothing to do with Bayaz. Not with him, not with any\nmagus. Take no favours from him, owe no debts to him, make no deals with\nhim. Do not please him. Do not displease him. Do everything possible to\nescape his notice altogether. Promise me.”\n“All right,” she said, frowning. “I promise.” If she was to have a statue\non the Kingsway, she supposed she would have to win it for herself.\n“Good. Good.” Her father winced as he settled into his chair, drunken\napplause in the background as a dance came to its end. “The time may soon\ncome when I cannot protect you any more.”\n“Is that what you’ve been doing?”\n“Believe it or not, I’ve been trying.” He frowned over the rooftops\ntowards the dome of the Lords’ Round, the great black shape soaring high\ninto the night sky, a grand replacement for the one destroyed the year\nSavine was born. “Sometimes,” he murmured, “the only way to improve\nsomething is to destroy it, so it can be rebuilt better. Sometimes, to change\nthe world, we must first burn it down.”\nSavine raised one brow. “Valbeck may be better in the years to come.\nBut being there while it burned was far from pleasant.”\n“The emperor’s prisons were far from pleasant.” He licked at his empty"

Being your\nfather… is the thing I am proudest of. It’s the only thing I’m proud of.”\n“And you’re not even my father.”\nShe wanted to strike some spark of anger from him. But all he did was\nslowly nod, a trace of a smile as he looked up at the stars, bright in the clear\nsky. “That should tell you what I think of everything else I’ve done.”\nBeyond the windows, the band struck up a jaunty reel, one of her mother’s\nfavourites, people clapping and stamping and laughing in time. “Could you\nwheel me back in?”\nShe thought about wheeling him off into the flower beds. But in the end,\nshe took the handles of his chair and turned it about, that one wheel slightly\nsqueaking. “I can do that.”\nFuture Treasons, Past Affairs\nL\neo raised his fist to knock, and paused, clenching it so hard his knuckles\nclicked.\nIt was a bloody humiliation. He’d never had much respect for Orso as a\nman, and he’d been losing respect for the Crown as an institution for\nmonths. Now he had to spend part of his wedding night begging for\nforgiveness from his wife’s former lover. It was an utter bloody humiliation.\nBut it had to be done. He was a leader, and a husband, soon to be a\nfather. He had responsibilities. He was starting to see that humiliations\ncame with the territory.\nHe forced on a smile, seasoned it with just a sprinkle of shame, turned\nthe doorknob and stepped through. “Your Majesty, I…”\nYou could’ve said there were a lot of kings in that vast salon. Twenty, at\nthe least, of the Union’s best, in uniforms, hunting garb, full armour,\nperched on gilded chairs or astride mighty steeds, sneering, smirking,\npouting down at Leo from towering canvasses. But of the current throne-\nstuffer there was no sign.\nIn fact, the only living occupants of the room were Lords Isher, Barezin\nand Heugen, gathered around a table in one corner in a secretive huddle.\n“Leo!” called Isher, raising his glass. “It seems the king couldn’t stay.”\n“More important matters,” said Heugen, leaning to light his pipe at a\ncandle.\n“At the whorehouse, I understand,” added Barezin, sloshing amber spirit\nfrom the decanter and nudging the drink towards an empty chair.\nLeo felt angry colour rising to his cheeks as he limped over. “The\nwhorehouse?” All the effort he’d put into his apology and the arrogant\nbastard couldn’t even be bothered to hear it?\n“If you ask me…” Heugen puffed out sweet-smelling chagga smoke.\n“You’ve not a thing to apologise for.”\n“You told the truth,” said Barezin. “Everyone knows it. He’s the one\nshould apologise.”\n“Kings don’t,” grumbled Leo, dropping into the empty seat and\nsnatching up the drink.\n“Not this one, anyway.”"

We can’t let things carry on like\nthis!” He glared at a painting of Orso’s father King Jezal, handsome enough\nbut with a helpless set to his shoulders even as a young man. An ineffectual\nditherer who lost every war he’d fought and achieved nothing but\nunmatched debts, and his reign was starting to look like a golden age. “We\ncan’t let the Union just… slide into the fucking sewer!”\nIsher gave Barezin and Heugen a significant glance. “There comes a\npoint,” he said with great care, “when talking about a better world is simply\nnot enough. There comes a time… when men of conscience, principle and\ncourage must dare the unthinkable… and fight for a better world.”\nThere was a long, expectant silence. The hairs on Leo’s neck prickled. A\nclock on the marble mantel tick, tock, ticked. He looked the three lords in\nthe eye, one after another. Isher spoke far from plainly but, at the same\ntime, left no doubt what they were discussing.\n“Mightn’t some men call that…” Leo licked his lips and shuffled\nforward on his chair, hesitating to say the word in full view of all those\npainted monarchs, and finally forcing it out in a breathy murmur.\n“Treason?”\nHeugen gave a huff of upset. Barezin’s jowls wobbled in denial. Isher\nfirmly shook his white head. “We would be acting in the king’s best interest.\nIn the country’s best interest.”\n“We would be freeing His Majesty from the chains of his Closed\nCouncil,” said Heugen, his airy gestures making Leo think of liberty and\nhonesty, and most certainly not treason.\n“We need to replace those corrupt old bastards with patriots,” boomed\nBarezin, filling Leo’s glass again.\n“Men who can give the king the right advice.” Isher waved towards a\npainting of Harod the Great, who’d first forced the splintered kingdoms of\nMidderland together into a Union and looked exceedingly pleased about it,\ntoo. “Guide the Union back to its founding principles.”\n“Back to glory!” Barezin punched his palm as if it was nowhere near\nglorious enough. “Men of action! Men who can make the Union great\nagain!”\n“Men like us,” said Heugen, eyebrows raised as though the idea had\nonly just occurred.\n“The Closed Council are the same self-serving liars who lost us three\nwars against the Styrians!” hissed Isher, and Leo could hardly deny it.\n“Who nearly drove Westport out of the Union! Who turned the commoners\nagainst us to the point they burned one of our greatest cities! They’re the\nenemies of the state. Ousting them is the act of loyalists.”\n“Loyalists,” mused Leo, taking another drink and feeling its heat\nspreading. He’d always been fiercely loyal. No man more of a patriot.

A coven of greedy bureaucrats who’d sent him no\nhelp in war and only outrageous demands for tax in peace? A libertine king\nwho’d had him thrown from the Lords’ Round and, it seemed, fucked his\nwife?\nLeo frowned up at the painting of Casamir the Steadfast, who’d ripped\nAngland from the clutching hands of the Northmen—strong-jawed, fully\narmoured and pointing out something on a map. There was a king. There\nwas a man. He seemed to be challenging Leo with his piercing stare, as if to\nask him, What the hell are you going to do about all this?\nWhat would Casamir have done? What would any good man have done?\nLeo looked the three lords in the eye again, one after another, and drained\nhis glass. “Well,” he said, “you all know I’ve never backed down from a\nfight.”\nNow they huddled in close. United by a common enemy, and a shared\npurpose, and a righteous cause. Just talk, of course, fuelled by Leo’s\nfrustration, and jealousy, and the pain in his leg. Just talk, perhaps, but\ndangerous, still. Exciting, still. Just talk, wasn’t it? But with each word said\nit became more thrillingly real.\n“It might be a fight against friends,” murmured Barezin, glancing\ntowards the window. “Against neighbours. Against colleagues.”\n“Certainly against your father-in-law,” said Isher. “The king dances to\nhis tune. If we on the Open Council have one enemy, it’s the Arch Lector.”\n“He may be my father-in-law,” said Leo, “but I’m no friendlier with Old\nSticks than you are. Less, if anything.”\n“We would need a leader,” said Isher. “A military man.”\n“A latterday Stolicus!” frothed Barezin, filling Leo’s glass again.\n“A man whose name inspires respect on the battlefield.”\nLeo’s heart beat faster at the thought of strapping on his armour. He\nbelonged at the head of ranks of cheering soldiers, not harassed and\nhenpecked behind some dusty old desk. He smiled as he thought of the\nmarching boots, the wind taking the flags, the ring of drawn steel, the\ndrumming hooves of the charge…\n“How many men could we count on?” he asked, sipping steadily. It\nreally was a hell of a brandy.\n“We three are committed,” said Isher, “and many other members of the\nOpen Council are with us.”\n“Most,” said Heugen. “Almost all!”\n“You’re sure?” Leo got the vague sense they had been thinking about\nthis for a while.\n“They have been frustrated for years,” said Isher. “Chafing at the taxes,\nthe infringements, the insults. Wetterlant’s treatment, and yours—a genuine\nhero of the Union, mark you, in our own Lords’ Round—was the final\nstraw.”\n“You’re damn right there,” grunted Leo, clenching his fists. He couldn’t\ntell if all this was just talk or not, but he was starting to hope it wasn’t.\n“Could you count on the forces of Angland?” asked Barezin eagerly."

Mustred and Clensher’s\nfury. The soldiers cheering for the Young Lion. He drew himself up.\n“They’d follow me into hell.”\n“Good to hear.” Isher tapped at his glass with one well-shaped\nfingernail. “But we do not want it to come to that. Even with the Open\nCouncil and the army of Angland united, we could not be sure of victory.”\n“We must take them by surprise,” said Heugen. “Field a force no one\nwould dare to resist!”\n“We need outside help,” said Barezin.\nLeo frowned into his half-empty glass. “The Dogman has hundreds of\nhardened warriors.”\n“And he owes you,” said Heugen. “For your help against Ironhand.”\n“He’s an honourable man. A true straight edge. He might join us… if it\nwas put to him the right way.”\n“Who understands the Northmen better than you?” asked Isher. “Who\nhas been their neighbour, fought beside them, lived among them?”\nLeo gave an artless shrug. “I’ve got some friends in the North.”\n“Without doubt…” Isher glanced at Heugen, then at Barezin, and then\nback to Leo, “not least the King of the Northmen himself, Stour Nightfall.”\nLeo froze, glass halfway to his mouth. “Not sure I’d call him a friend.”\n“He owes you his life.”\n“But there’s a reason they call him the Great Wolf.” He thought of\nStour’s hungry smile. His wild, wet eyes. The legions of merciless\nNorthmen they’d faced at Red Hill. “He’s savage. Bloodthirsty.\nTreacherous.”\n“But you could keep him on the leash!” Barezin clapped Leo on the\nshoulder. “And how many warriors could he call upon?”\n“Thousands.” Leo tossed down the rest of his drink and pushed the glass\nback for a refill. “Many thousands.”\nShe was there in a vast living room when he opened the door, arranged on a\nchaise in a great flood of cream skirts with the usual care, as if a sculptor\nhad positioned her just so as his model.\n“Your Grace,” she said.\n“Your Grace,” returned Leo, sounding grumpy and drunk. “You’ve been\nwaiting.”\n“Traditionally, brides do wait for their husbands on a wedding night.”\n“I’m sorry,” he said, not sounding sorry at all. “I was held up.” He\nglanced towards a chandelier of Visserine crystal which must have carried a\nhundred candles. “These are… our rooms?”\n“You have a dressing room through there, and a bedroom beyond.” She\npointed out a distant doorway through which he caught a glimpse of manly\npanelling. “My rooms are that way.” Pale paint and tapestry in the other\ndirection, a dressing room big enough for ten, but then it probably took ten\nto dress her.\n“We’re not sharing a bed?” he grumbled.\nShe spread her arms across the back of the chaise. “I suppose that\ndepends on your mood.”\nHe frowned up at a vast canvas.

A masterful-looking military man in a\nneat black uniform frowned back. “Who’s this?”\n“Your grandfather.”\n“Lord Marshal Kroy?” He’d commanded the Union army at the Battle of\nOsrung, and died when Leo was small. He only remembered the man from\nstories, really. But there was undoubtedly a hint of Leo’s mother about his\nwithering frown. “Couldn’t find one of my other grandfather?”\n“They’re in short supply. He was a famous traitor.”\nLeo flinched at that. Maybe treason ran in the family. He wandered\nacross what felt like an acre of Gurkish carpet, between carefully arranged\ngroups of furniture, past a stuffed songbird in a glass case. This one room\nwas the size of the Dogman’s hall in Uffrith. He wondered if it had been\nbuilt from scratch in the week since he proposed. Or she proposed. Or their\nmothers proposed. It wouldn’t have surprised him. There didn’t seem to be\nanything Savine couldn’t organise. Or wouldn’t organise, given the chance.\n“I thought decorating might bore you,” she said. “If there’s something\nyou’d prefer, I can change it.”\n“It’s fine,” he grunted, frowning at two antique swords crossed over the\nmighty fireplace. It was about the finest room Leo ever saw, in fact, a\nperfect balance of money and taste, clearly done with his feelings in mind.\nHe should’ve thanked her. But he was drunk, and his leg was sore, and he\nwas in no mood to thank anyone. Particularly not her.\n“Did you speak to the king?”\nLeo ground his teeth. “He didn’t bother to turn up. Had to get to the\nwhorehouse, I hear.”\n“There’s kings for you. Another day.”\n“Fuck him,” snapped Leo, more harshly than he’d meant to. “I’ve been\nwith Isher. And Heugen and Barezin.”\n“Ah, the great minds of the Open Council.” Her total calmness was only\nmaking him angrier. It was how his mother would’ve behaved, but with\nmore of an edge. “What did they have to discuss?”\n“Nothing much.” Only civil war. “State of the government.” And its\nviolent overthrow. “Banter, you know.” It had been banter, hadn’t it? Or had\nthey been deadly serious? Had he been deadly serious? He turned away to\nfrown out of the window, through the darkened trees towards the lights on\nthe Middleway.\nHe heard the rustle as she stood. “Is something bothering you?”\n“No.” Only future treason. And past affairs.\n“Come now.” She came to stand beside him. “There should be no secrets\nbetween husband and wife. Not on the first day, anyway.”\n“You’re right.” He turned to look at her. “But we hardly know each\nother, do we? We spent one night together.”\n“Part of one night.”\n“Part of one night.

A woman\nmade from porcelain could have given more away. “And what did you\nsay?”\n“I told her if she repeated it, I’d break her fucking nose.”\n“That I’d rather like to see.”\n“Is it true?”\n“Had you imagined I was a virgin?”\n“Any doubts on that score were put to rest in Sworbreck’s office.”\nHer eyes narrowed ever so slightly. “As I recall, you were far from a\nreluctant visitor.”\n“Not the only one, by all accounts. Is it true?”\nA muscle worked in her jaw. She hid it well, but he could feel the anger\ncoming off her. He rather liked it. “The king and I have… some history.”\nShe was breathing hard, through her nose, chest rising and falling. “But that\nis what it is. History. It’s nothing for you to—”\n“Is the child mine?” he asked.\nHer eyes narrowed further, hard creases spreading around the bridge of\nher nose, chin angrily pointed up at him. “How can you ask me that?”\n“Is there even a child?”\nShe hit him.\nNot some theatrical little tickle. She hit him as hard as she could with an\nopen hand, and for someone of her size she hit shockingly hard.\nIt made a sharp smack, knocked his breath out in a sharp gasp, snapped\nhis face sharply sideways and made him stagger against the window frame.\nThere was a pause which felt very long, then he turned slowly back\ntowards her, and he stared at her, and she at him.\n“Leo,” she whispered, lifting a trembling hand. “I—”\nLeo caught it by the wrist. “Shush.” Shock had turned to excitement, and\nexcitement to a thrill that reached every part of him. Very slowly, very\ndeliberately, he lifted her hand up, and let go of it.\nHis breath came fast, almost painful in his throat. The blood had flooded\nto his face, making it burn and tingle, but you could’ve said just the same\nfor his cock.\nVery slowly, very deliberately, without taking his eyes from hers, he\nturned his unslapped cheek towards her. He thought he saw the slightest\nsmile at the corner of her mouth as he said the word.\n“Again.”\nThe next slap was no softer than the first.

Her other hand was already busy with his belt. He kissed\nher back, clumsily, angrily, tangled his fingers in her hair and it shifted in\nhis hands. A wig. It came loose, skewed, she twisted it off and flung it away.\nShe looked shockingly different without the softness of it, hair clipped to\ndark stubble, lips curled back in a snarl, paint smeared from one eye down\nher cheek in a black streak.\nShe shoved him. He didn’t even try to stay standing. Caught his head on\nan occasional table as he fell, bit his tongue and sprawled on his back,\nsurrounded by scattered ornaments. Marshal Kroy stared down at him from\nthe heavy frame. His feelings on the business were hard to judge.\n“You fucking worthless shit,” she hissed, ripping Leo’s trousers down\naround his ankles. He gave a dumb moan of excitement with every breath,\nshivering, trembling, wriggling up onto his elbows. He could see the whorl\nin her hair at the crown of her shaved head as it bobbed up and down,\nlapping, slurping.\n“Fuck…” he whimpered, dropping back. Almost painful, almost painful,\nthen definitely painful. By the dead, his leg was on fire, trapped under her at\nthe wrong angle. “Fuck…” His mouth tasted of blood. He reached out\ndesperately, caught the claw-carved leg of an armchair and gripped it like a\nman hanging from a cliff by a tree-root, carpet rucking up around his\nshoulders as he wriggled helplessly. “Fuck… ah… ah—”\nShe clambered over him, dragging her skirts up around her chest with a\nripping of gauzy fabric and a couple of pearls popped free and rolled\ntwinkling away. He reached for her, wanting to drag her down, wanting to\nkiss her, but she caught his wrist.\n“Don’t fucking touch me!” She forced his arm down above his head,\npinned it against the floor. She was strong, but not that strong. He could’ve\nflung her across the room if he’d wanted to.\nHe wanted nothing less.\nSkirts tickled him under the chin as she straddled him, muscles\ntwitching around her sharp collarbones as she reached down, and\nsomewhere in that mass of rustling fabric gripped hold of his cock.\n“Stay…” she breathed, lips twisted around gritted teeth, “there.” She\nworked her hips in circles, she giving a little growl and he a little sob each\ntime she pushed lower.

        "text": "don’t change.”\nThe same table in the same little place they’d always favoured. The\nsame overwrought furniture and the same threadbare drapery. The girls\nwere different, and looked even more nervous than they used to, but then\nthe girls were always different and always looked nervous. It all seemed a\nlittle sadder than he remembered. But maybe he was the sad one.\nOh, and six Knights of the Body stood about the walls, bristling with\nweaponry, trying to look as inconspicuous as half a dozen fully armoured\nmen can in a brothel, which proved to be not very. Corporal Tunny didn’t\nappear to notice. He was a man who could play cards through battle, flood\nor riot and, indeed, claimed to have done so on more than one occasion.\n“Oh, we’re still here.” And he carelessly nudged a few more coins into\nthe pot.\n“Can’t see that changing,” said Yolk, filling up everyone’s glasses again.\nOrso really should’ve told him not to, but he was too drunk to bother.\n“Unless the king were to go to war again, of course.” Tunny raised his\ngrey brows significantly at Orso. “In which case, my standard-bearing\nservices are always at Your Majesty’s disposal.”\n“Glad to know that my standard, if nothing else, would be competently\nhandled.” Orso tossed his awful hand away with a flourish. “But I think I’ve\nhad quite enough of war.”\n“You show more wisdom than your father, in that case.” Tunny started to\nrake in the pot. “I’ll have to stick to procuring whores for Your Majesty.”\n“How do you feel about being the king’s pimp?” Orso let go a burp. A\nroyal burp, he supposed. He’d been drinking all day. Hadn’t helped. Never\ndid.\n“Daresay there are worse jobs.” Tunny gripped his pipe between his\nyellowed teeth as he shuffled. “Less marching than in the standard-bearing\ngame, at least. More fighting, mind you, but at least there’s the chance of\nmaking people happy. Sure you won’t join us, Colonel Gorst?”\nGorst shook his head, eyes eternally roving around the dim room as\nthough a Styrian assassin might spring from the dresser at any moment. If\none had, Orso never doubted Gorst would have been ready with the utmost\nextremes of lethal force.\n“You two know each other?” Orso looked from the old bodyguard to the\nold standard-bearer. They were probably of an age, but otherwise could\nhardly have been less alike.\n“Fought together at the Battle of Osrung,” said Tunny, starting to deal.\n“Well, I say fought. He fought. I just sat there.”\nYolk raised a finger. “I sat there, too.”\n“So you did, boy, and you even managed to do that badly.”\nYolk grinned. “If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s doing things badly.”\n“I hear you sentenced Wetterlant to dangle,” said Tunny, still flicking out\ncards.\n“I did,” said Orso. “Terrible decision.”\n“Everyone says he’s guilty,” threw in Hildi, who was sitting cross-\nlegged on the dresser between two large candlesticks shaped like naked\nwomen."

Its usual expression.\n“So…”\n“I tried to manage a compromise in which he’d get life in prison,\nprobably to worm his way out when nobody was looking.”\n“Compromise is always a good idea,” threw in one of the whores.\nOrso raised his brows at her, and she blushed, and looked at the floor.\n“So I thought, but it turned out to be the worst option of all. I made the fatal\nmistake of trying to improve things. And of trusting Lord bloody Isher.” He\nscraped up his hand and started sorting through it. “A king can only select\nfrom a range of wrong choices and bad outcomes.” Another awful hand.\nEven worse than the last. “A lifetime of trying to ferret out the least worst in\na mist of lies, stupidity and imperfect information.”\n“Sounds like the army life,” muttered Tunny. “Wish you’d come to me\nfirst. I could’ve told you Isher’s a snake.”\n“I should put you on my Closed Council.” Orso paused a moment,\nlooking at his glass. “Actually, I’ve heard worse ideas.”\n“High Justice Tunny!” Hildi gave a giggle, and a couple of the girls\nlaughed, and Orso thought he even heard a snort from one of the Knights of\nthe Body.\n“Charmed by the offer, Your Majesty,” said Tunny drily, “but corporal’s\nas high as I go.”\n“Leo dan Brock would make a fine king, don’t you think?” asked Orso.\n“Don’t you think? With those shoulders?”\n“He’s pretty,” said Hildi, twisting her old soldier’s cap off so her blonde\ncurls popped out in a mop, then twisting it back on.\n“He’s very pretty,” said one of the girls, and the others nodded\nagreement.\n“Bold,” said Yolk, thoughtfully. “Very… manly.”\n“Reckless,” piped Gorst. Orso turned to him, surprised. It might have\nbeen the first time he’d ever heard the man volunteer a word of\nconversation. He shrugged, armour faintly rattling. “Kings needs cool\ntempers.” And he went back to frowning about the room.\nOrso turned to the table to find the madam leaning over him in an\nexplosion of heavily daubed perfume and lightly veined bosom. “Might one\ninterest… Your August Majesty…” She traced a wiggly line on the tabletop\nin a manner that was perhaps intended to be arousing. “In anything?”\nOrso sighed. “Fucking-wise?”\n“It is what we do here.”\nThe girl who had extolled the virtues of compromise gave Orso a\nslightly desperate smile.

He was in a mood only for bad news. “It’s a Union\nindeed. United in their dislike for their king.”\n“That’s what a king’s there for,” said Tunny. “High or low, we all need\nsomeone to blame.”\n“Who do I get to blame?” asked Orso.\n“Whoever you like,” murmured Yolk, frowning at his cards. “You’re\nking.”\n“My Closed Council, my Open Council, the boy who empties my\nbloody chamber pot, too, I shouldn’t wonder, they all think I’m a fucking\n—”\n“Who cares a shit what they think?” shouted Tunny, jerking forward and\nstabbing at Orso with the stem of his pipe. “Long as they bloody obey!\nYou’re king, boy! Not me, not Yolk and not Leo dan bloody Brock! You!\nNow, I daresay being king has its downsides but I can tell you there are\nworse jobs.”\n“Huh,” grunted one of the girls, adjusting her bodice.\n“All this bloody self-pity. It was fun when you were a crown prince, but\nfuck, it doesn’t suit a king.” Tunny took a pull on his pipe, but it was dead,\nand he angrily smacked the ashes out on the tabletop. “Get back to the\npalace and get on with it. We’ll miss you, but these lovely ladies need to\nmake some money and you’re scaring away the guests.”\nThere was a long silence. Orso glanced about the room. Everyone—the\ngirls, the knights, the madam, Hildi and Yolk, even Bremer dan Gorst, had\nthe same expression: mouth tight shut and eyes wide open, an expression\nthat seemed to say, I can’t believe he said it, but it definitely needed saying.\n“I see.” Orso tossed down his cards and stood, with only a small wobble.\n“Gorst, we’re going back to the palace. Hildi, could you see everyone paid\nfor their time, please?”\nShe frowned over at him. “You already owe me sixty—”\n“I think we know I’m good for it.”\n“We do?”\n“I’ll talk to the lord chancellor and have you written into the budget,\nhow’s that?” As the knights tramped down the stairs to leave, Orso leaned\nclose to Tunny. “Thank you for that, Corporal.”\nWithout looking up from his cards, Tunny gave a grudging nod. “Any\ntime, Your Majesty.”\nThe Darling of the Slums\n“M\norning, Your Grace,” said Leo, stepping out onto the balcony.\n“Morning, Your Grace,” said Savine as he sat opposite her at the\nbreakfast table and gingerly stretched out his leg.\nShe shifted subtly, trying not to let her own discomfort show.

Savine had been softening all over since she\ngave up fencing. Gripping a sword made her think too much of Valbeck.\nScrabbling with the hilt in a sweaty panic as she tried to pull up that loose\nboard, men screaming for her blood outside the door—\n“So…” Leo frowned out towards the Middleway, where the morning’s\ntraffic was already busy, then gave a helpless little laugh. “We’re married,\nthen.”\nSavine banished the ugly memories and held up the new ring she had\ncommissioned, its satisfyingly colossal stone flashing in the morning sun.\n“So it would appear.”\n“What happens now?”\n“I recommend the trout.”\n“And then?”\n“Give me and Zuri a week here to put my affairs in order, and then to\nAngland—”\n“Where you can put my affairs in order?”\n“Where I can help you put them in order.” And people might care less\nabout appearances and Zuri would not have to haul quite so savagely on the\nlaces. “Probably best that we leave before Wetterlant’s hanging.”\n“I might hold off on saying sorry to His Majesty as well.”\nSavine winced. “I hope my… history with the king will not—”\n“If he’s fool enough to let the most beautiful woman in the Union slip\nthrough his fingers, then I pity him.” And Leo gave her that big, boyish\nsmile, the one that made a faint groove from the scar on his cheek.\nShe found she was smiling back, and not even having to pretend.\n“That’s… a rather lovely thing to say.”\n“Don’t get used to it.” He scooped a piece of trout onto his plate then\nsucked the fork. “I’m not much of a flatterer.”\n“Oh, I think you could prosper at anything you put your mind to.”\nHe smiled even wider. “That’s a rather lovely thing to say.”\n“I’m one of the best flatterers in the Union, ask anyone.”\nHe laughed, and started eating, and she rather enjoyed watching him. So\nstrong and healthy and handsome. No sign of last night’s anger now. Except\nperhaps a faint pink graze her open hand had left on his cheek. The Young\nLion had his moods but it seemed they passed quickly, like stormclouds\nsweeping over the rugged Northern valleys and just as quickly letting the\nsun shine again. She could work with that. Who doesn’t have moods, after\nall? Savine had been in one ever since she got back from Valbeck.\nHaroon had to squeeze his great shoulders together to fit through the\ndoor onto the balcony. “Spillion Sworbreck is here, Lady Savine.” A few\nmonths in Adua and he had barely any accent at all.\n“Thank you, Haroon, you’re a treasure. Send him out.”\nLeo frowned after him. “Not sure how your servants will go down in\nAngland.”\n“Angland will just have to get used to them.

Haroon used to be an officer in the emperor’s\narmy, I believe, and Rabik’s an absolute magus with horses. As for Zuri…”\nShe was Savine’s closest friend, and the very thought of her being\nunwelcome somewhere made her want to grind that place under her heel.\n“She is indispensable. My business interests would suffer more without her\nthan without me. I would trust her with our lives.”\nLeo prodded at his fish. “Just feels like there are too many brown faces\naround in Adua these days.”\n“Too many for what? The people who come here are hard workers. They\nbring wealth and energy and new ideas. There are great thinkers among\nthem. Great engineers. And how would you stop them, anyway? Make us\nless prosperous?”\nLeo did not look convinced. He was not a man much moved by reason.\n“We fought a war against the Gurkish,” he grumbled.\n“You fought a war against the Northmen. Some of your best friends are\nstill Northmen.”\nHe actually looked slightly offended. “Not all Northmen are the same,\nyou know.”\nThere was a snapping of cloth and Sworbreck swept onto the balcony,\nbecame briefly entangled in the drapes but manfully fought his way free. He\nwas fresh from another trip to the Far Country and was affecting the facial\nhair of a fearless adventurer.\n“Your Grace,” he intoned, giving Savine a flourishing bow. “You look a\nveritable goddess, as always.”\n“Master Sworbreck, how was your latest escapade in the unsettled\nWest?”\n“Wild and packed with danger. I have tales to tell which the pampered\ncitizens of Adua will scarcely credit!” Savine certainly would not credit\nthem, for she had it on good authority that he rarely strayed far from the\nharbour at Rostod and paid a scout to wear his clothes while riding across\nthe plains so they would have an authentically adventured-in appearance on\nhis return.\n“And may I introduce my husband, Leo dan Brock?”\n“Your Grace.” Sworbreck gave an even more flourishing bow. “An\nabsolute honour to make the acquaintance of the hero of Red Hill and\nconqueror of the Great Wolf!”\n“I don’t like to talk about that,” said Leo sternly. Sworbreck blinked,\nmouth slightly open. Leo burst out laughing. “It’s all I’d bloody talk about\nif I had my way!” And he seized Sworbreck’s hand and nearly dragged the\nhapless writer off the balcony with the vigour of his shaking. “I think I\nvisited your office once.”\nSworbreck must have guessed what they had used his office for, but to\nhis credit he gave no sign of it. “My humble premises are forever at your\ndisposal, as is my humble pen.”\n“I have a use in mind for the latter.” And Savine nudged a chair out with\none shoe so Sworbreck could sit. “The name Glokta carries… something of\na stigma.”\n“A proud name, but I see Your Grace’s point.

There is a flavour of…”\n“Torture?”\nSworbreck gave an apologetic smile. “The name Brock has entirely\ndifferent connotations. Heroism, patriotism, derring-do! Have you\nconsidered a biography, by the way, Your Grace?”\nLeo paused with fork halfway to his mouth. “I’m twenty-two years old. I\nhope I’ve a few achievements still to come.”\n“Your famous victories thus far are, one cannot doubt, but a prelude, but\nthere would be great public interest even in a first volume or two—”\n“My name,” Savine reminded him.\n“Of course, my apologies, new ideas erupt and must be thrust aside! A\ncurse of the artistic temperament.”\nFar from the only one, in her opinion. “Savine dan Glokta was a woman\nof business,” she explained. “She needed a reputation for cunning,\nruthlessness and flinty resolve.”\n“She needed the confidence of investors, the respect of partners, the awe\nof debtors,” mused Sworbreck, “but… Savine dan Brock, Lady Governor of\nAngland, might be… a woman of the people? A woman who balances\nwisdom with warmth and generosity? A woman who struggles tirelessly for\nthe common good?”\nCurnsbick was always saying that he suspected Savine of hiding a\ngenerous heart. Perhaps the time had come to put it on public display.\n“What do you think about a series of pamphlets discussing my charitable\nwork in the Three Farms? Nothing too obvious, you understand.”\n“I am all in the subtext.” Sworbreck sat back, considering the trees in\nthe garden as though their branches were laden with weighty revelations. “It\nwould help if we could find our way to a place of honesty. I hope you will\nnot think me indelicate if I suggest we might… make use of your\nexperiences during the uprising in Valbeck?”\nSavine felt a sick surge of fear, then a sting of annoyance at her own\nweakness. All it took was a mention of the place to set her heart thumping\nand turn her mouth sour, to send that tickling shiver up her back.\nHer voice came strangled. “How do you mean?”\n“You lived among the common folk there.” The Broads’ cramped\napartment, her bed of rags, the cries echoing through the blistering walls.\n“Their daily trials were yours.” Up to her knees in the cold river, throat raw\nfrom smoke, endlessly filling buckets to put out fires that could not be put\nout. “The hunger.” Queueing for vegetable peelings, and grateful to get\nthem. “The danger.” The sound of the gangs outside, the screams in the\nnight. “The daily want.” Her wheezing breath as she dragged herself\nthrough the machinery, blood spattering the floor—\n“Of course!” she barked, knuckles white as she gripped at the edge of\nthe table. “A place of honesty.” If Sworbreck could spin diamonds out of\nshit, good luck to him. Where the hell had she put her pearl dust?\n“A story of personal growth,” the writer was musing. “Of dangers faced\nand trials braved.

Are you aware of Carmee Groom? She did\nsome sketches for my Life of Dab Sweet. One of the best artists in Adua, but\nshe is not in the greatest demand because she is…”\n“A she.”\n“Indeed. A few etchings can truly make a pamphlet sing. Words are\npowerful, but an image can shortcut the reason and speak directly in the\nlanguage of the heart.”\nSavine snapped her fingers. “Done. We can visit the Three Farms this\nafternoon.” Once she and Zuri had calculated the precise minimum a\nreputation for charity could be bought for.\n“Then I shall make the arrangements at once!” said Sworbreck,\nspringing up. “Your Grace. Your Grace. Do think about that biography.”\nAnd he ducked back through the window.\n“So… that’s the famous writer?” asked Leo. “He has some of the bravest\nfacial hair I’ve ever seen.”\n“Despite being one of the biggest cowards in the Union.”\n“I suppose if he was brave, he wouldn’t need such brave facial hair.”\n“And if everyone was brave, what would make you special?”\n“Well…” He gave her that grin again. “I am married to the cleverest\nwoman in the Union.”\n“Stop,” she said, smiling as she leaned towards him. “By which I mean,\ndon’t.”\n“I won’t. But… pamphlets?”\n“Absolutely.”\n“Etchings?”\n“The language of the heart.”\n“Do you really think people are that stupid?”\n“Darling.” She leaned closer, and kissed him gently, and touched him\nlightly on the tip of his nose with her fingertip. “People are far more stupid\nthan that.”\nThe city closed in around them and, like a rake falling into a life of\ndebauchery, turned mean, twisted, sick and dirty. High above, so high that it\nseemed no one could ever reach it, a narrow crack of sky showed between\nthe crumbling tenements.\n“And so we pass into the Three Farms.” Sworbreck spoke in an urgent\nwhisper, scribbling away in his notebook. “Perhaps the most infamous of\nAdua’s districts, once largely burned then brutally occupied by the savage\nGurkish, now rendered into an endless night… no, a perpetual dusk by the\nsmoke of the manufactories, and a moral murk even more complete in\nwhich… what? In which the light of hope is extinguished for its thousands\nof wretched inhabitants. Can I find a place for the word crepuscular, do you\nthink?”\n“I try to find a place for it in every sentence,” said Carmee Groom, her\nfair brows raised very high.\n“Not much of a reader myself,” said Leo, leaning close, “but he sounds a\nbit overwrought.”\nSavine shrugged. “That’s what people consider good writing these\ndays.”\nHe nodded towards a pair of ragged boys shovelling horse-dung onto a\nrotting wagon. “What’re they doing?”\n“Making a living.”\n“Out of shit?”\n“All you need is a shovel and a poor sense of smell.” Savine made an"

Shadows were one of the few things there was no\nshortage of in the Three Farms. In some of the narrower lanes, you would\nhardly have known it was day. “This is no place for wealthy folk to walk\nalone. Nor writers and artists neither.”\n“Never fear!” called out Sworbreck. “I learned well the value of a stout\nescort out in the wilds!”\n“Where did you find your man Broad?” murmured Leo.\n“In Valbeck. He and his family took me in. I’ve no doubt they saved my\nlife.”\n“So you took them in.” Leo was grinning at her. “You do have a heart.”\n“A generous one, according to my friend Curnsbick. But settling one’s\ndebts is simply good business. And the Broads are all useful people.”\n“No doubt. That’s a Ladderman’s tattoo on his hand, you know. First\nmen onto the walls in a siege. Most deadly duty in the whole army. And\nfour stars means he did it four times.” Leo glanced sideways at Broad.\n“That… is a dangerous man.”\nSavine remembered him facing down six Burners that first night in\nValbeck and stomping their leader’s head into the cobbles. The fear she had\nfelt. And the relief.\n“Calm,” Savine whispered, under her breath. “Calm, calm, calm.”\n“We live these days in a segregated society,” Sworbreck was burbling,\nnudging up his eye-lenses with the end of his pencil. “A stratified world\nwhere rich and poor rarely mingle! No, wait, mingle is weak…”\nThey passed under the great chimney of a salt works, walls black with\ncrusted soot. Flies buzzed around a dead horse. Three ragged children\nplayed in the gutter. Every other building here was a jerry shop, everyone at\nleast halfway drunk, or so ill they looked drunk. Most of the rest were pawn\nshops, sad little fragments of broken lives priced low in their grubby\nwindows.\n“The gap between rich and poor has never been wider. The chasm has\nnever yawned so deep! But one woman dares to bridge the divide!”\nSworbreck gave a delighted cackle. “Bridge the divide, that’s lovely. She,\nlike few others among the wealthy and noble, goes forth among the people.\nShe, like few others, understands their plight!”\nSavine did understand it. But if she truly went to a place of honesty, all\nshe really felt was glad she was no longer one of these wretched ghosts. All\nshe really wanted was to get back to her palatial rooms and her\nconscientious servants as soon as possible.

The houses fall apart with the families\ninside.” Who would know better than Savine? She owned dozens of similar\nbuildings herself.\n“Why no window frames?”\n“The tenants tear them out in the cold months and burn them for\nfirewood.”\n“By the dead…”\nBehind them, Sworbreck scratched on in his notebook. “We speak, of\ncourse, of none other than Her Grace—and grace is the right word, dear\nfriends—Savine dan Brock!

A strange building stood at one side, an ancient low\nhouse with a sagging, moss-covered roof.\n“What is that?” asked Leo.\n“One of the three farms,” said Savine, “that stood here before the city\nswallowed them.”\n“Hard to imagine anything ever grew here…”\nOne pig screamed at another as they fought in a mound of filth.\nSomeone shouted drunken abuse in a tongue she did not recognise. A cheap\nflute tooted hopelessly, blending with the mindless music of steam hammers\nin a foundry across the way.\nZuri waited with Haroon and Rabik and two of Broad’s men. She had\ngathered a queue of the most wretched, a lot of dark faces among them.\nRefugees from the collapse of the Empire of Gurkhul, seeking safety and\nsanity and finding little of either.\n“Thank you, Zuri.” Savine swallowed her nausea. “You’ve done a\nmiraculous job, as always.”\n“I fear there are no miracles down here.” Zuri frowned towards the\nprocession of the desperate. It reminded Savine of the queues she had stood\nin for one of the few working pumps in Valbeck. The long walk back with\nthe heavy buckets bruising her calves, water slopping at her legs, the\nunbearable aching in her shoulders with every step.\n“Calm, calm, fucking calm…”\nRabik watchfully held her purse while she took coins from it and\npressed them into filthy, calloused, broken hands.

Hands of beggars, children, whores\nand thieves.\nWith Haroon’s help, Leo was handing out loaves from a cart, clapping\npeople on the back, shaking his head at their thanks, throwing open his\nbrimming heart and spraying well-wishes. Savine said nothing. She was\nworried if she opened her mouth she might drown the neighbourhood in\nspew.\n“As Lady Brock moves through those darkened streets, it is as if a lamp\nshines. No, a beacon! Lighting the way to a better life for these neglected\nunfortunates. As if the sun breaks through the smoke of the manufactories.\nShe gives out bread, yes, she gives out comfort, surely, she gives out silver\nwith an open hand, but more valuable than all, she gives out hope.”\n“Very nice,” murmured Carmee Groom, eyes flickering over the scene\nas she pinned her hair back up with a clip from her drawing board and\nbegan to sketch.\n“Isn’t it!” said Sworbreck. “All shrouded in secrecy, though, we must\nmake that point. We have stumbled upon her anonymous generosity! She\nwould blush to hear it spoken of. For she is the personification of\nhumility… or modesty? Modesty or humility?”\n“Why not both?”\n“Is this what Valbeck was like?” Leo muttered at Savine.\n“Before the uprising, maybe. Then it got worse. We picked through the\ndung heaps for something we could eat.”\n“What can we do for them? I should’ve brought my purse. Never use the\nbloody thing.”\nHe really did have a big heart. It made her strangely glad to know that\nsomeone did. A big heart, but not the biggest brain. Help to these people\nwas a coin tossed in a pool. It might make a few ripples, but they would\nquickly vanish as though they had never been. The bread would be gone in\none swallow. The money would be wasted on drink and husk, a moment of\nsweet oblivion. Perhaps, at best, some tatty heirloom temporarily reclaimed\nfrom the pawn shop.\n“Who, on account of her charity… no, selflessness… on account of her\nremarkable charity and selflessness, has become known among the common\nfolk of Adua, as, hmmmm…”\nA little urchin with a scabby rash across her face gazed up as Savine\npressed a coin into her palm. She felt crushed, like a swineherd being\nsmothered by hungry pigs. “Do you need much more?” she snapped.\n“Almost there,” said Carmee Groom, freckled face wrinkled with\nconcentration as she drew.\n“Benefactor?” mused Sworbreck. “The benefactor of the Three Farms?”\n“Too cold.”\nSavine flinched at a shower of sparks from an open shed door. She felt\ntrapped in this stinking gloom. She felt almost as trapped as she had in\nValbeck. She had to get out.\n“The… saint?” Sworbreck raised his brows high. “Of the hovels?”\n“Too religious. We’re not in Gurkhul.”\n“No, we are very much in the slums of Adua…”\nThat girl with the rashy face had caught Savine’s skirts. Clutching at the"

Clutching at the\nonly kindness that had ever been shown her, perhaps, no matter how much\nof a sham it was. Leo was watching with tears in his eyes. If they stayed\nmuch longer, he would probably adopt the little limpet. Savine’s greasy skin\nwas crawling. She wanted nothing more than to kick the girl off into the\ngutter. Forced herself by a towering effort of will to keep the smile nailed to\nher face as Rabik tried to gently peel her dirty hands away.\n“How about…” Carmee Groom narrowed her eyes at the scene,\nscratching thoughtfully at the side of her nose with her pencil. “The\ndarling… of the slums.”\n“Oh, my dear.” Sworbreck looked up wide-eyed from Carmee’s paper to\nSavine, holding up his hands as though framing a painting with her as its\nsubject, that desperate orphan clinging to her feet. “You should be a writer!”\nDead Wood, New Shoots\nI\nt was a sunny spring morning when Rikke walked back into Uffrith.\nShe used to feel a rush of warmth passing through those weather-pitted\ngates, hearing the gulls and the chatter, smelling the sea. She used to reap a\nhappy harvest of smiles and waves on the way to her father’s hall. There\ngoes Rikke—she’s mad as a shield made of bread, but we like her. Coming\nhome. By the dead, she needed that feeling then.\nBut things had changed since she went to the forbidden lake, and not\njust ’cause she kept getting surprised on her right-hand side. The left was\nfull of sad shocks, too. Folk she’d have called friends stared as she passed\nlike they saw the dead walk, slunk off and wouldn’t meet her one good eye.\nFolk who used to smile looked scared, shocked, disgusted even. One\nwoman Rikke had never been able to shut up about the weather herded her\nthree children inside at the sight of her and slammed the door.\nTill that moment, she’d been tricking herself that everything would drift\nback to normal, or as close to it as her life got. Five steps into town, it was\nclear no one would ever look at her the same again.\nStung somewhat, but she wasn’t about to let it show. She buried her\nhurts, like grown-ups were meant to, and tried to walk the way she’d seen\nSavine dan Glokta walk. Shoulders back, chin up, making no apologies.\nLike Uffrith was hers and these bastards only got to live here ’cause she\nwas in a good mood.\nShe leaned close to Shivers without letting the knowing half-smile slip.\n“I look that bad?”\n“You look better’n me,” he said, which was scant encouragement.\n“They’ll get used to it,” said Isern.\nA scruffy little girl with a scruffy little dog gawped as she passed. The\ndog couldn’t take its shocked eyes off her, either. “People can get used to\npretty much anything,” said Rikke.\n“That’s why they’ll get used to it.”\n“Rikke?”"

She squatted down to ruffle his scruffy\nhair.\n“You’ve changed some,” he said, still staring.\n“Aye.”\n“You used to be all twitchy.”\nShe lifted her hand up and held it still. It was steady as the line between\nsea and sky. “Seems I’m cured of that,” she said.\n“You cured o’ smiling, too?”\n“I can still smile, you cheeky shrimp.” Though when she forced a grin\nout it felt strange on her face, the skin still raw where the tattoos were\ndrawn.\n“Can you see all right?”\n“Can’t see at all with this eye.” She winked at him with the right, and it\nmade no difference. She took a hard breath as she stood, watched the grey\nsea shifting. “But the other sees better than ever.”\nThere were a lot of people gathered in front of her father’s hall. There\nwere always folk wanting something from him. Always wanting more than\nhe had to give, whether it was silver, or men, or reassurance, or favour.\nThey’d drained him dry of all of them, down the years.\nHardbread hastened up the cobbled road, his white hair wild. When he\ngot close enough for his weak old eyes to get her measure he froze.\n“Hardbread,” she said, giving him a nod.\n“Rikke…” He sounded more’n a little sick. “That you?”\n“Aye. I cut my hair.”\nHe stared at her some more. “Rikke, I have to tell you something.”\n“It’ll have to wait. Need to talk to my da.”\n“That’s the thing.”\n“What’s the thing?” she asked as she shoved the doors of the hall wide,\nand stopped, her weight all on one wobbling foot.\n“Oh, no.” And she sagged like a scarecrow had its pole ripped out.\nCaurib had warned her the Long Eye wouldn’t keep her safe from all life’s\naxes. “Oh, no.”\nHer father lay on the table, his old, notched sword on his chest. His hair\nand his beard were white. His face and his hands were white. His eyes were\nclosed.\n“Oh, no.” Everyone watching her, silent, slipping out of her way as she\nwalked up, like you might from someone had the plague. She stopped by\nthe table, looking down at her father. Seemed he had the ghost of a smile\nabout his mouth.\n“He never smiled enough,” she whispered.\n“Aye,” said Shivers, soft and low. “Those were the times he lived\nthrough.”\n“He done the best he could with ’em.”\n“None better,” said Isern, and she took a long breath and puffed it out,\nragged. “Back to the mud.”\nRikke put her fingertips on her father’s cheek. “Peace at last, eh, Da?”\nshe whispered, and her right eye tickled and stung and leaked. Might not\nsee any more, but it could cry, still.\nHer left stayed dry, though."

Silence, while everyone wondered how Stour would take the news\nso they could take it the same way.\nThen the young king tipped back his head and roared with laughter, and\nas if that was permission given, they all set to chuckling, too. All of ’em\nexcept Clover. He weren’t really in the mood.\n“What was it Shama Heartless said?” asked Stour, wiping his wet eyes.\n“There’s only one kind of good news, and that’s dead enemies. Reckon\nthose sorry bastards’ll be joining the North sooner than we hoped, eh,\nClover?”\n“Prefer to eat the eggs I’ve got, my king, rather’n the ones still up in the\ntree.”\n“Good point, Clover, good point.” Stour grinned his wolf grin and with a\nsnapping of cloth pulled his wolf cloak around his shoulders. “Let’s take\nnothing for granted. We’ll head straight into Uffrith, pay our respects. Or\nthe lack of ’em. Then we can talk to Oxel. See how things stand.”\n“Oxel’s there,” said Greenway. “I seen him.”\n“Lovely.” Stour rubbed his palms together with a faint hissing. “That’s\nhappy timing. Auspicious timing. Auspicious is the word, eh, Clover?”\n“It’s a word,” said Clover, under his breath.\n“How about Red Hat and Hardbread?”\n“Aye, they were there, with their long, grey faces, and I hear the\nDogman’s daughter, too—”\n“Ha! You hear that, Clover? We’ve caught up to that fucking little bitch\nat last. This’ll be fun. Ain’t nothing prettier than a pretty girl crying, eh?”\nThere really was nothing to be said to that.\nThe sun was shining in Uffrith, but the place had a sullen feel. The\nDogman had been loved, few men more, and it looked like his daughter\nweren’t the only one felt they’d lost a father. Mourners gathered in a long\nqueue, grave gifts in their hands, but Stour strode grinning past ’em, lapping\nup their scowls and their curses. He was one of those men loves to be\ndespised. That treats loathing like gold, to be clawed for and hoarded up. He\nhadn’t learned yet that hate’s the one thing never runs out.\nThere was quite the gathering inside the hall. Named Men, fussed up in\ntheir best, gold and jewels glittering in the gloom on helms and hilts. Oxel\nwas there, as expected, and Red Hat and Hardbread, glaring at each other\nalmost as much as at Stour.

Isern-i-Phail sat on a step, slowly chewing, long spear across her\nknees, and as Stour strode in she made a long sucking through the hole in\nher teeth that spoke her scorn louder than any words.\nLots of weapons in that hall, lots of sorrow and lots of anger, and Clover\nmade sure he knew where all the doors were. When a great man dies, those\nleft over always take a moment working out where their loyalties are most\nfruitfully laid, and there’s a high risk of bloodshed in the meantime. He’d\nseen one funeral turn into several often enough.\nThe Dogman himself lay pale on the long table, scarred shield under his\nfeet, a hint of drama from a shaft of light falling on him through the smoke-\nhole. A woman stood over him in the shadows, back to the door. Her red-\nbrown hair was clipped short and it made her neck look very long and very\nthin, blue veins standing stark up the side.\nStour strode into the silent hall, steel toes on his boots scraping. “I just\nhad to pay my respects!” Voice dripping contempt, not caring a shit, as\nusual, for anyone’s feelings but his own.\nThen the woman turned, and that shaft of light caught her smile, and\nStour shuffled to an uncertain halt. So did his men. A dozen warriors always\nkeen to advertise their courage, but they all checked at the sight of her, and\nClover hardly blamed ’em.\n“By the dead,” muttered Greenway, taking a nervy step back and near\ntripping over his own sword.\n“The King of the Northmen!” she raised her arms in delight. “What a\njoy! The gates of Uffrith stand open to you, even though last time you\nvisited you burned the place, eh? Eh? Eh?” The last eh? hissed through her\ngritted teeth, spit spraying.\nRumour was the Dogman’s daughter was a witch. That she had the Long\nEye. Clover hadn’t taken it too seriously. Now it was hard to doubt. She’d\nturned so lean her face was like a skull, skin so stretched you fancied you\ncould see through it, scabbed and angry around her left eye, across her\nforehead, her cheek, the bridge of her nose. Clover wondered if, of the two\nof ’em, her father looked the healthier.\n“What the hell happened to you?” muttered Stour, giving voice to the\nthoughts of everyone in the hall, most likely.\n“A sorceress said she could make me more ordinary,” said Rikke. “Or\nshe could make me less. Guess which I chose?”\nShe strutted closer, bony shoulders tipped back, bony chin tipped up,\nand the mingling of that battered face and that snake-like swagger and that\nfriendly grin and those mad, mad eyes was really most off-putting.\n“I’ve been in the High Places. Up in the mountains, beside a lake.” And\nshe waved a hand, runes on thongs around her thin wrist clicking and\nclattering. “Fine views, but the water was a little chilly on the toes, eh,\nIsern?”"

The kind of cold that burns all your doubts away.\nWhole business was…” And Rikke opened her eyes wide, so wide it\nseemed they might pop out of her pinched-in face. “Eye-opening. I see right\nthrough you, now. Right through all of you.” And she laughed, a jagged\nlaugh, like she’d left her senses far behind her, and it didn’t help at all that\nshe was laughing at her father’s funeral.\nStour twisted his face sideways as she came close, like he was looking\ninto a wind. Her right eye was all swollen, many-coloured bruises on the\nbloated lids and a great red stain all across the white of it, pupil shrivelled\nto a milky pinprick. The pupil of the other yawned huge and black, and\nClover saw the scabbed and angry skin around it was pricked with designs.\nA cobweb of black lines and letters, circles and symbols, so fine it seemed it\ncouldn’t have been drawn by men at all. Clover never saw a thing looked so\nmuch like witch’s work, and the warriors muttered and shifted, a dozen big\nmen edging back fearful from one girl thin as a birch sapling.\n“Fucking witch,” muttered one who came from over the Crinna, making\na holy sign across his chest. “Should be burned.”\nRikke smiled at him, pointing with one thin finger. “But it’s you who’ll\ndie by fire!” She smiled at Greenway. “You on the water! And ’cause I’ve\ntold you so, all the days you have left, you’ll go in fear of streams and boats\nand wells and cups and every drop of dew shall be a terror.” She wagged\nthat finger at him. “But the water will find you out. It will leak in through\nthe cracks in your life no matter how you try to caulk ’em up. I see the\nGreat Leveller coming, and there are no bargains made with him.” She\nstared at Stour, and took a necklace of green stones she wore and dragged\nthem back until they made a noose, cutting into her thin neck. “But it’s steel\nfor most of you. It takes no Long Eye to see that.” She dropped the necklace\nand laughed again. “Stay! You’re all welcome. Stay, and I can tell you\nmore.”\n“Not me,” muttered Greenway, who should’ve been called Whiteway\nhe’d turned so pale. He blundered to the door, and saw a bucket there put\nunder a leak, and he shrank away from it, then scrambled out into the\ndaylight. The rest of Stour’s big men weren’t far behind him. Seemed this\nhadn’t turned out quite the fun he’d promised.\nThe Great Wolf himself stayed to give the room a wet-eyed scowl.\n“We’ll be back,” he barked out. “See that, witch!” And he shoved past"

She’d come a long,\nhard way by a crooked road, he reckoned.\n“I remember,” she said. “Do you want to hear what’s coming, Jonas\nClover?”\n“Reckon I’d rather not.” Wasn’t easy to meet those strange eyes, one\nseeming too shallow and one too deep. But he made himself do it. “Just\nwanted to say I’m sorry about your father. Didn’t know him well, but I wish\nI’d known him better. Ain’t many left in the North you could say that much\nfor.”\n“Why don’t you stay?” she asked, raising one brow. Seemed the other\ngot shaved off when the tattooing was done. “We can talk about what’s\ncoming.”\n“D’you know? I wish I could.” And it was true. He’d rather have stayed\nwith the witches and the dead than gone back out to Stour and his bastards.\n“But I am what I am.” Nightfall had the power. More even than before, with\nthe Dogman back to the mud. And Clover was done with losing sides. So he\nnodded to Isern-i-Phail, and nodded to Rikke, too. Then he turned for the\ndoor.\nShivers stood in his path, that metal eye glinting in the shadows. “We\nstill need to have that talk.”\n“We do.” Clover thought about giving Shivers a clap on the arm or\nsomething, but he didn’t really seem the arm-clapping type. “More’n ever.”\nThen he left.\nIt was raining when they put him in the mud. Thin rain, making the whole\nworld damp. Soft as a maiden’s kiss, as he used to say. Seemed right,\nsomehow, for the occasion. The gulls and the sea and the sad voices\ndeadened. Everything deadened, like the world was wrapped in a shroud.\nUsually, when a man goes in the ground, there are a few words said.\nWords from his chief or his family. How good they were, how strong, how\nbrave. How much missed they’ll be by those staggering on. But today, it\nseemed everyone in Uffrith had words. The little garden beside the hall was\npacked shoulder to shoulder, mourners spilling out into the wet lanes\naround.\nOne by one they took their turn at the head of the fresh-turned earth,\nshuffling up to speak their piece till the whole plot was boot-mashed. Till\nthe whole plot looked like a grave. Everyone had a story. Some kindness\ndone. Some wisdom offered. Some little piece of courage that’d given them\ncourage. Soft words spoke with smoking breath. Tears lost in the drizzle.\nThey said he’d been the best of his kind. The last straight edge.

Closest\nfriend to the Bloody-Nine, worst enemy to Black Dow, who’d fought for\nBethod and fought against him, across the North and back.

Hardbread talked of the Battle of Osrung, folk murmuring\nwith every famous name—Curnden Craw and Whirrun of Bligh and Cairm\nIronhead and Glama Golden. He started at a creaky murmur, white hair\nplastered to his liver-spotted pate, but by the end he was glaring lightning\nand bellowing thunder as he told of the high deeds done in the valleys of the\npast. Old men made young again in the fire of those memories, just for a\nmoment.\nThen Shivers stepped up, one hand on the grey pommel of his grey\nsword, and with the other he pushed the hair back from his scarred face, and\nspoke in that broken whisper. “Some o’ you have had the misfortune o’\nknowing me a long time. I used to be…” He ran out of words a moment,\nstood there silent with teeth clenched. “I was everyone’s enemy, and my\nown most of all. A man who’d used up all his chances and didn’t deserve\nanother. But the Dogman gave me one. In hard times, it’s easy to become\nhard. But here was a man who always looked for the best in folk. Didn’t\nalways find it, but never gave up looking. Wasted no time polishing his own\nname. Singing his own songs. Didn’t have to. Every man and woman in the\nNorth knew his quality. Back to the mud, Dogman.” And he gave the earth a\nslow nod. “Feels like the best of us goes in the ground with you.”\nQuiet, then. That heavy quiet, and Isern set a hand on Rikke’s shoulder.\nA gentle hand, for once, soft as the rain. “You want to speak? You don’t\nhave to.”\n“Aye,” said Rikke. “I do.” And she slipped through the damp-eyed\ncrowd to the head of the grave. It was a good spot for him. In the garden he\nwished he’d tended better. Looking down over the city he’d fought for so\nmany years. Looking down towards the sea. He’d have liked friends beside\nhim, she reckoned. But their lonely graves were scattered across the North,\nwherever they’d died. That’s a warrior’s life. A warrior’s death.\nShe looked up, saw all those sad faces turned towards her, all waiting for\nher to say something worth hearing.\n“Shit,” she croaked, shaking her head at that heap of ground. She’d\nhelped to pile it on him. There it was, dark in the grain of her hands, black\nunder her fingernails. Still she couldn’t believe he was under there, and\nwouldn’t step smiling from the crowd to give the last, best word. “Fucking\nshit.” She took a long, salty sniff, and rubbed the wet from the blind side of\nher face.\n“Been a fine thing listening to you all.” She tried to smile but it came out"

So many burdens he took a little\npiece of onto his own shoulders. No wonder he was crooked at the end. No\nwonder. Guess we’ll have to carry our own burdens now. Or maybe all\nshare a little o’ the load between us.”\nFolk held each other. Squeezed each other’s hands. She wondered how\nlong that good fellowship would last. Not long, was her guess.\n“All them battles.” Her voice had faded to a croak, she had to clear her\nthroat to get it going again. “All those great names he stood beside. Fought\nagainst. His story was the story of the North, for sixty years and more.\nYou’d think he was the last o’ some race of giants to hear talk of his\nvictories but…” And she grinned, despite herself. “He was a small giant,\nmy da. He’d rather have been growing things than killing ’em. Didn’t get\nmuch of a chance at it, as this garden’ll testify. He was always going to tend\nto it tomorrow. But he loved to sit here, with the sun on his face. He could\nspend hours here, looking to the sea. Hoping better times might roll in on\nthe tide.”\nShe wished she had better words. Ones that somehow bound up all he’d\nbeen to her. All the things felt but never said. All the holes he’d leave\nbehind. But how can you fit all that in a bit of breath?\n“By the dead, I was proud to be his daughter,” she said. “Folk can talk a\nlot of shit at a funeral, but even his enemies thought he was the best man in\nthe North.” She took a damp breath and blew it out hard, her lip trembling.\n“That’s all I got.”\nShivers put a hand on her shoulder. “Good words, Rikke.”\nBit by bit, with shuffling feet and hanging heads, folk started to drift\nback to their lives. Bit by bit, the garden emptied. Rikke stood looking at\nthe ground, wishing she could see through it. Wishing she could force the\nLong Eye open and see her father’s face again. But her eye stayed cold as\nthe rain, and the sea, and the cold ground.\n“You really see their deaths?” Hardbread’s brow was creased with\nworry. “The Great Wolf and his arseholes. You really see all that…” And he\nwaved nervously towards her tattooed face. “With the Long Eye.”\n“I saw enough,” she said.\n“You surely made ’em run, all right. You made ’em scamper.”\n“I did, didn’t I?” Caurib had been right. The power of the Long Eye\nwasn’t so much in what you saw, but in what you made folk believe. Rikke\nhad never felt powerful in her life till she made Stour and his men turn tail\nwith just her eye and her words. “But they’ll be back,” she said. “Like\nwolves prowling just beyond the firelight.”\n“Aye.” Hardbread scrubbed unhappily at his wet wisps of hair. “Do you\nsee what we should do now, then?”"

At least he’s a warrior.”\n“You don’t know who his enemies’ll be from one moment to the next.\nNot even he does! And you want us to go lick his arse?”\n“Better his than some Union fool who’s never drawn a sword, a\nthousand miles away across the sea.”\n“Can’t say I like the taste of anyone’s arse too much,” muttered Rikke,\nsqueezing at the bridge of her nose with finger and thumb.\n“You’re a woman,” said Oxel, with a sneer.\n“True,” said Rikke. “I realised that the first time I tried to piss standing\nup. Most disappointing day of my life.”\n“My point is, you can’t lead. But there’s some who’ll listen to you, still.\nOut o’ respect for your father—”\n“And my pretty smile? What about my pretty smile? I’ve a pretty smile,\nhaven’t I, Isern?”\n“Like the sun peeping from behind a stormcloud.” And Isern picked at\nthat hole in her teeth with a fingernail, rooted some scrap of food out of it,\nheld it thoughtfully to the light, then ate it.\nOxel ground his teeth. “There’s a reckoning coming and it can’t be put\noff. You all want to make sure you’re on the right side of it!” And he stalked\naway, his warriors shooting glares about as they followed, to let everyone\nknow they meant business.\n“Stour wants Uffrith,” growled Red Hat, before they were even gone.\n“He wants everything we’ve got and Oxel’s planning how to hand it over.\nWe have to—”\n“Give it all away to the Union first?” asked Rikke.\nRed Hat held his hands up. “I’m old, Rikke. You get old, and you get to\nthinking—what kind o’ world will I leave to my grandchildren? Do I want\n’em to have to fight all the same bloody wars I fought? You were close with\nBrock. He’s Lord Governor now. You could talk to him.”\nRikke snorted. “I’d rather bloody talk to Stour.”\n“No, you wouldn’t,” said Isern.\n“No, I wouldn’t,” admitted Rikke. “But neither much appeals.”\n“I’m sorry about your father,” said Red Hat. “I stood second to him most\nof my life. I couldn’t be sorrier. But tears’ll wash no one clean, my ma used\nto say. The Protectorate was never going to outlive him. Oxel’s right about\none thing. Folk’ll listen to you. You’d best decide which side o’ this you’re\non.”"

You’d best decide which side o’ this you’re\non.”\nHe jerked his head to his men, and they tramped off after Oxel.\nHardbread was doing some head-shaking of his own as he watched them\ngo. “Put three Northmen together, you’ll get three different ideas.”\n“Unless you’re one of ’em,” said Isern. “Then you’ll get two ideas and\none old bastard tearing his hair out trying to choose between ’em.”\n“Or trying not to,” said Rikke.\nHardbread sighed. “Aye, well, I got my mouth smashed by Whirrun o’\nBligh one time and ever since I’ve been trying my best to keep things\npeaceful.”\n“Shame you can’t side with everyone when everyone’s on a different\nside,” said Shivers, arms folded. “You have to pick one.”\nHardbread looked over at Rikke. “So which’ll you be picking?”\n“Picky Rikke, eh? Ain’t long since I was choosing an eye, and now I’ve\ngot to choose a side?” She squinted up at the sky, where the rain was\nslacking off. “I’ll let the earth settle on my father, then I’ll get the garden\ntidied, then I’ll have a little think. The moment I’ve made my choice, I’ll let\nyou know, how’s that?”\n“Fine with me. ’Course it is. Just don’t think too long. This is apt to get\nbloody.” And Hardbread and his warriors took their own share of the\nstriding off, leaving Rikke, and Isern, and Shivers alone in the dripping\ngarden.\n“I’ve heard it said you can tell how great a man was by how quick folk\nstart to argue once he’s dead.” Isern thoughtfully narrowed her eyes.\n“Seems your father was an even greater man than I supposed.”\nRikke gently shook her head. “Never noticed I had a pillar propping me\nup till it was gone. Feels like I’d give the eye I’ve got left for one more talk\nwith him.”\n“That deal’s not on offer,” said Isern.\n“Probably just as well. I’ll need all the eyes I can get to see a path\nthrough what’s coming.” She set one hand on Shivers’ shoulder, and one on\nIsern’s. “Reckon I’ll need the two of you, too.”\n“I’ll be here,” said Shivers.\n“Whatever you want,” said Isern, licking finger and thumb then rolling\nchagga between them into a pellet. “But… what do you want?”\nA good question. Rikke pressed at the raw skin around her eye with her\ndirty fingertips. Things would be different now. Everything would be\ndifferent, and her especially. She was nowhere near getting used to losing\nher face, and now she’d lost her father, and it looked like her home might\nget took away as well. “My da said you have to be realistic. My da said you\nwant things right, you have to put ’em right yourself. My da said Uffrith\nwould need my bones and my brains when he was gone.”"

Old men, I swear. They get weak and stubborn both\nat once, so they make no good ideas but won’t be shifted from the bad\nones.” She offered the pellet to Rikke. “Trouble snaps ’em straight to\nsplinters.”\n“My da said they’d need my heart, too,” said Rikke, slipping it up\nbehind her lip.\n“Mmmmm,” hummed Isern, rolling another pellet for herself. “It’s a\npretty notion. But you don’t have your da’s name, or his fame, or—let’s not\ndress it up—a cock.”\n“So if you’ve no cock, you can’t afford a heart?”\n“Not if you want to get shit done. I tell you this, Black Calder didn’t get\nhis way through kindness.” She popped the chagga in her mouth and started\nto chomp on it. “You have to make of your heart a stone, d’you see?”\nRikke heaved up another sigh. “I do. Half the eyes these days, maybe,\nbut I see twice as clear.” She squatted down to set her hand on the fresh-\nturned earth one more time and gave it a pat. “You rest now, Da.” The sun\nwas coming out, at least, and she looked to the sea, and watched it glitter.\n“I’ll take care of things from here.”\nPART V\n“Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.”\nBenjamin Franklin\nThe Favourite Son\nT\nhe ship’s timbers grated against the wharf and Leo took a deep breath of\nthat good Angland air. Felt pure after the smogs of Adua. Felt honest.\nThere was quite a crowd on the docks to welcome him and his bride to\nOstenhorm, and the weather might’ve been grey but their smiles were\nsunny. Someone was waving a battle flag. The crossed hammers of\nAngland, ragged from action. It made him think of Red Hill, of the fight on\nthe bridge, of the men marching to victory. It made him impatient to march\nagain.\n“They love you,” said Savine, staring at the cheering people.\n“Well, you know how it is. They love men who win fights.”\n“Leo, they really love you.”\n“Not sure I’ve ever seen you surprised before.”\n“I have seen angry mobs and needy throngs, but I cannot say I was ever\nactually liked.”\n“I bet they’ll like you now.”\nShe hesitantly raised a gloved hand and waved. The cheers grew louder.\nA little boy jumped up and down on the quayside so wildly, Leo worried he\nmight fall in the sea.

Short of diving into the brine, there was no escape.\n“We need to talk, Your Grace!” snarled Mustred.\n“More troubles over taxes,” growled Clensher.\n“The damned Closed Council have no shame!”\n“Nor pity! Someone has to draw a bloody line!”\nLeo winced. He’d hoped at least to make it to the Lord Governor’s\nresidence before the bureaucratic bog closed over his head again. “We’ll get\nto that, my lords, but could I first present my wife, Lady Savine dan\nBrock?”\n“You must be Lord Clensher.” She slipped gracefully forward to offer\nher hand. “I do like your boots, are those new?”\n“Well… as it happens, Your Grace…” grumbled Clensher as he bent to\nkiss it. He’d clearly been aiming to disapprove of Leo’s choice of wife but\nwas already finding it difficult. “I know your father, of course.”\nSavine laughed as though he was being hugely charming. “I can only\napologise for that. But I am not my father. I am your Lady Governor, and I\nam here to do everything I can to help. How is Lady Lizet?”\nClensher’s bushy brows shot up. “You know my wife?”\n“Only by reputation, but I am keen to put that right. My friend Tilde dan\nRucksted is her niece, of course, and speaks so very highly of her. I\nunderstood she was having troubles with her back?”\n“Well… she—”\n“I took the liberty of bringing some salts that I am told can work\nwonders.” And Zuri produced a jar of coloured powder from her bag.\n“That’s immensely thoughtful,” breathed Clensher, utterly disarmed.\n“And Lord Mustred—what a magnificent moustache—I brought you a\nnewly printed volume on the heraldry of Angland and Starikland, do you\nhave that one?”\nMustred stroked the binding as Zuri passed it to him. “Why… no, but\nit’s always been a particular interest of mine!”\n“Such a happy chance!” As if anything Savine did was by accident. She\nsmiled even more sweetly, holding out both hands. “And you must be\nJurand, Leo’s old friend and comrade.”\n“Er…” Jurand had been giving her quite the frown, for some reason, but\nnow he started to soften. “Yes—”\n“I heard you had all the brains around here but Leo, why didn’t you tell\nme how very handsome he is?”\n“Well…” Leo cleared his throat. “I suppose that’s not the sort of thing a\nman notices…”\nHe watched as Zuri magicked one packet after another from her\nbottomless bag. Savine had brought gifts for everyone. And not just any old\nrubbish. The kind a dear friend would bring on a special occasion. In a\nmoment, she changed the mood from angry suspicion to baffled delight.\n“It took me years to tame the old dogs,” murmured Leo’s mother from\nthe corner of her mouth. “She has them eating out of her hand the moment\nshe steps off the boat.”"

Perhaps one of you two magnates\nmight be kind enough to show me the way?”\n“It would be my honour!” shouted Mustred, offering his elbow.\n“My particular pleasure, Your Grace!” shouted Clensher, offering his,\nand she glided off with an old lord on either side, both gormlessly grinning\nas they competed for her attention. For maybe the first time since he took\nhis mother’s place as Lord Governor, Leo was free of their demands. Free\nto limp over to his cheering people and press hands, slap shoulders, return\ntheir beaming smiles. Free to actually be a leader.\n“Bloody hell, Leo.” Antaup stared down at a shining pair of new spurs\nwith his family crest on the buckle. “I think I’m in love.”\n“I know,” said Leo, smiling at Savine. Everyone was smiling at her right\nthen. “I think I am, too.”\nSteel on steel. By the dead, how Leo loved that sound. Sweeter than\nbirdsong. He caught Jurand’s sword on his, blades grinding then ringing as\nhe flung his friend away, pressed in with a couple of cuts and made him\nstumble back, only just keeping his balance on the wet grass.\n“Better.” Jurand was grinning as he found his stance again. “Much\nbetter.”\n“Oh, that’s nothing,” said Leo, grinning, too. It was good to be back\nwith him. Very good. And the rest of the boys, of course.\nThe leg was still sore, but he was learning how to manage it. He’d\nstrapped a belt around it under his trousers, just above the knee. Made it\nstiffer, but a lot more solid. Jurand tried to circle but Leo watched, waited,\nforced him to circle back the other way. He’d had to change his style. Far\nless aggression. Much more patience.\nJurand darted in but Leo was ready, parried once, twice, a careful shuffle\nto shift his weight then a pinpoint jab, and another, and he sent Jurand\nstumbling back the way he’d come.\nSavine had told him to look at his leg as simply a new challenge.\nOvercoming challenges was what he did, after all. And she was right. When\nwasn’t she?\nJurand came on again, but he was tired from all that dancing. Leo\nparried the first thrust, sidestepped the second to let it slip past him, then\ntwisted, swung, flicked the back of Jurand’s leg as he blundered past and\nsent him rolling across the lawn with a despairing squawk.\nAntaup punched the air. “A touch to the Young Lion!”\n“Damn it!” Jurand propped himself on one elbow and spat grass. “I take\nit the leg’s feeling better?”\n“Far from healed.” Leo bared his teeth at the pain as he pulled Jurand to\nhis feet. “But I have to be ready.”\n“For what?” asked Antaup, waggling his eyebrows. “You’re a married"

Leo thought\nSavine might’ve loosened one of his teeth last night.\n“How are the men?” he asked.\nJurand was trying to scrub the grassy stain from his fencing jacket. “I\nwas going to disband two regiments, now we’re on a peacetime footing—”\n“Don’t.”\nAntaup narrowed his eyes. “Expecting trouble?”\n“It’s possible.”\n“From who?” asked Glaward, always spoiling for a fight. “Not the\nbloody Northmen again? Or are you thinking about Dagoska—”\n“A good deal closer to home.” They all looked at him, curious, excited.\nLeo knew there was nowhere safer than the gardens of the Lord Governor’s\nresidence, no one he trusted more than these four, but even so he felt the\nneed to draw his friends in close. Every time he whispered the words, every\ntime he told someone new, it became that little bit more real, that little bit\nmore dangerous. “From the Closed Council.”\nJurand’s eyes went wide. “You can’t be serious.”\n“It’s chaos in Adua! Far worse than I dreamed it could be. Trouble with\nthe Breakers. Trouble with the nobles. The Closed Council is out of control.\nKing Orso is out of his depth. They’re throwing away all our principles.\nEverything we fought for. Everything my father fought for!” He was\nmaking himself angrier and angrier, and his friends’ faces were getting\nangrier with him. “They’re dragging the country into the fucking sewer!\nDid you hear what happened to Fedor dan Wetterlant? Did you hear what\nhappened to me?”\nJurand exchanged a worried glance with Glaward. “We heard…\nsomething about it.”\n“Thrown out of the Lords’ Round!” snapped Leo. “For telling the truth!”\nJin ground one big fist into his palm. “Wish I’d been there.”\n“Next time you will be,” said Leo, putting a hand on his shoulder. “We\ncan’t let the bastards get away with it. There comes a point when talking\nabout a better world just isn’t enough. When good men have to bloody\nstand up and fight for it!”\n“Damn right,” growled Glaward. “Damn right.”\n“Fight the Closed Council, though…” Jurand had that disapproving\nlook. The one he had when Leo suggested a reckless charge, but worse.\n“Fight the king—”\n“Fight for the king!” Jurand’s doubt was making Leo doubt, and that\nonly made him insist the harder. “To free him from these bloody leeches,\nthese bloody bureaucrats. To put the Union back the way it should be.”\nEveryone looked convinced. Except Jurand. He looked less convinced\nthan ever. “But you’re talking about…” He dropped his voice to an urgent\nwhisper. “You’re talking about civil war, Leo.

A very great deal\nneeds to change around here.”\nNowhere was that more obvious than in the so-called governing council.\nIt might better have been called the grumbling council, since the old men\naround the monstrous table in the cavernous hall treated every point of\nbusiness as a problem to be avoided in the most tedious way imaginable.\nThe old bores tolerated Savine and Lady Finree’s presence provided\nthey sat at a rickety side table and busied themselves with something\nfeminine. Occasionally, when some particularly dated opinion or provincial\nattitude was expressed, their eyes would meet and Leo’s mother would roll\nhers to the heavens.

I didn’t ask for your advice, Mother.”\nThere was an awkward silence. Leo turned angrily away, rubbing at his\nleg. Lady Finree coloured as she retreated to her chair. Savine felt for her,\nshe really did, but she was yesterday’s woman. Her son might act like a\nchild on occasion but treating him like one was a blunder. If he had to have\nhis toy soldiers, Savine would find a way to give them to him.

They were made successful through my hard work and my investors’\nrisk.”\n“I understand the principle, I have done a little investing myself. Of\ncourse you own the mines. Apart from the ones I own, which are failing for\nlack of your new pumps. You own the mines, you own the ore mined from\nthem, no one would deny it.”\n“We are not pirates!” threw out Zuri, with a grin that might have sat\nquite well on a pirate.\n“But you do not own the rivers and roads that carry that ore to the sea,\nnor the docks on which that ore is loaded for transport to Midderland. Those\nbelong to my husband.” Savine opened her eyes very wide, as though the\nrealisation had but that moment dawned. “Why—I suppose that means they\nbelong to me?”\nZuri fluttered her lashes, all innocence. “So much to take care of.”\nArinhorm was looking more and more uncomfortable. “We pay towards\ntheir upkeep.”\n“Token amounts, as we both know,” said Savine. “We have gone over\nthe books, Master Arinhorm. I get the feeling that the worthy old gentlemen\nwho have been in charge of Angland’s government do not fully understand\nthe books. But we do. And we see all kinds of ways to make things more…\nequitable. Ways for the industries of the province to contribute to the\ncommon good.”\n“And if I refuse?”\nSavine shrugged. “I suppose you can always fly your ore across the\nCircle Sea.”\nArinhorm was moving from discomfort to anger. Savine rather enjoyed\nseeing it. “We will simply cut off supply! In no time, the foundries of\nMidderland will be clamouring at you to turn the tap back on.”\n“By all means let your ore rot in your warehouses, but then of course the\nprice of ore will rocket, and I imagine my failing mines will not be failing\nvery much longer.” Savine spread her arms comfortably across the back of\nthe chaise. “So you see, whichever door you open, Savine’s in first. In\nbusiness, Master Arinhorm, you must be realistic.”\nZuri pressed one hand to her breast. “You have to be realistic.”\n“Here is our suggestion. You will pay duties for every ton of ore moved\nover every mile of my husband’s province. You will also sign over to him a\none-tenth interest in all your concerns.”\n“But… you acknowledged they’re our mines!”\n“Of course.” Zuri nodded earnestly. “And, by my calculations, nine-\ntenths of them still will be.”\n“This is robbery!” he spluttered at her.\n“I said we are not pirates. Robbery is a much broader category. But the\nheading in my book is for…” She ran her finger down the page and tapped"

But the\nheading in my book is for…” She ran her finger down the page and tapped\nneatly at an entry. “Patriotic contributions.”\n“There,” said Savine. “Doesn’t that sound better? Something we can all\ntake pride in. You will also fit your pumps to my mines at your own\nexpense. Then we can allow you to operate.”\n“Allow…?” Arinhorm stared at her, open-mouthed.\n“Allow, Your Grace,” corrected Zuri, with impeccable timing. Savine\nhad heard it said that it is best to beat opponents fairly, but she much\npreferred beating them with the deck stacked wildly in her favour.\n“It has been a great regret,” she said, “that I let your scheme slip through\nmy fingers simply because I find you personally detestable. I am so pleased\nwe got the opportunity to do business together in the end.”\n“I will go to your husband!” snarled Arinhorm.\n“You will go to the Young Lion… to complain about his wife?” Savine\ngave Zuri a pitying look.\nZuri gave one back. “I imagine a man would be lucky to come away\nfrom that interview with his teeth.”\n“I have friends on the Open Council!” snapped Arinhorm.\n“I have dozens of them,” said Savine with a sigh. “That’s how I know\nhow little good they do.”\n“I will go to the Closed—”\n“Let me spare you the wasted effort. The Closed Council want revenue,\nand they have asked my husband to find it, so he has asked me to find it. I\nam doing so, with the enthusiastic endorsement of everyone who counts.\nSpeak to your investors, by all means, but my honest advice is to pay up\nbefore you make me squeeze harder. You’d be amazed at how powerful my\ngrip has become since I married the Lord Governor. I would hate to\naccidently crush someone completely but…”\n“It could happen,” murmured Zuri.\nArinhorm wobbled to his feet, but he had nothing to say. Savine had\nmade sure of that. All he could do was turn on his heel and stalk from the\nroom.\n“Oh, and Arinhorm?”\nHe looked back in the doorway, fists, teeth and no doubt arsehole\nclenched. “Your Grace?” he managed to hiss.\n“When you see her, do pass on my regards to Selest dan Heugen.”\nThe door clicked shut and Savine settled comfortably back again. She\nrealised she had not thought about Valbeck all day.\n“Is it wrong of me to have enjoyed that one?” asked Zuri, checking the\nwatch then marking another tick down in her ledger.\n“We must take our pleasures where we can. Who’s next?”\nA Little Public Hanging\n“I\nhate bloody hangings,” grunted Orso.\n“Distasteful but necessary.” His mother spoke in Styrian, of course,\ntesting the limits of the human skeleton for regal bearing and surveying the\nswarming humanity in front of the gibbet like a swan forced to preside over\ncrows. “Like so much of life.”\nOrso watched the hooded executioners test their machinery, oil the lever,"

Be Orso the Clement.”\n“Technically possible. Politically unthinkable.” Orso looked towards the\nbanks of seating reserved for the nobles and found more than a few of the\nsparse attendees glaring angrily back. At least Lady Wetterlant had stayed\naway. No doubt entirely consumed with plotting her revenge. “The nobles\nwould hate me no less,” he observed. In the great pen where the commoners\nwere crowded, by contrast, there was a carnival atmosphere: drinking,\nwhooping, happy children up on their fathers’ shoulders. They loved seeing\nanyone killed, of course, but the public execution of a member of the Open\nCouncil was a dream come true. “The commoners would hate me far more.\nAnd I’d look a wavering weakling to boot.”\n“If it cannot be helped then stop complaining. Be Orso the Stoic.”\nHe slumped ever more sourly into his gilded chair. “I doomed us to this\nwhen I looked for a compromise. When I tried to do the right thing.”\nThe Queen Dowager issued a frustrated tutting of her tongue. “Please,\nOrso, you are not the tragic lead in some overwrought play. You are a king.\nYou have no business talking about the right thing.”\n“Orso the Pragmatist is beginning to see that very clearly.”\nThere was a ripple of noise. Hooting, booing, insults. A wave went\nthrough the crowd as they pressed towards the barriers, grim-faced soldiers\nof the King’s Own holding them back.\nWetterlant was led up the steps to the scaffold, hands tied behind him.\nHe had changed again. His hair had grown back to an ugly fuzz, face\ngaunt and eyes sunken in dark rings. No trace of arrogance. The reality of\nhis situation must finally have impressed itself upon him. Orso had trusted\nIsher and ended up looking a fool. Wetterlant had trusted Isher and it would\ncost him his life. The crowd jeered louder as he was dragged into the\nshadow of the gibbet, his wide eyes rolling up towards it.\n“I almost feel sorry for the poor bastard,” muttered Orso.\nHis mother displayed no more emotion at the spectacle than a marble\nbust might have. “If you hate hangings so much, why even attend?”\n“It’s the king’s justice. How would it look if the king couldn’t be\nbothered to see it done?”\n“Your father was just the same. Never so happy as when he was\nmiserable.”\nOrso slumped further yet. “I never doubted I’d be a terrible king, but I\nnever thought I’d be my father’s son so— ah!”\nShe gripped his wrist with a sudden strength, immaculately manicured\nnails digging into him. “You are my son, too! So smile. And contemplate\nyour revenge.”\n“Fedor dan Wetterlant!” bellowed the Inquisitor in charge. The noise\ndropped back to an ugly murmur, peppered with yells and jokes. “You have"

The noise\ndropped back to an ugly murmur, peppered with yells and jokes. “You have\nbeen found guilty of rape and murder and sentenced to death by hanging.\nHave you anything to say?”\nWetterlant blinked stupidly at the nobles. At the commoners. At Orso\nand his mother. He took a shuffling step forward. “I…” He swallowed. “I\n—”\nSomething spattered against his shoulder. A thrown egg, maybe. As if\nthat was a signal there was another surge through the crowd. Soldiers\nshoved people angrily away from the barrier. The noise was redoubled.\nMore thrown rubbish bounced across the scaffold. Wetterlant tried to shout\nsomething but his voice was lost.\nThe Inquisitor gave a grimace of distaste, then nodded to one of the\nexecutioners and he thrust the hood over Wetterlant’s head from behind. His\nshrieks were quickly cut off as the noose was dragged tight.\n“Let him speak!” roared someone from the nobles’ enclosure. “Let him\n—”\nSomething hit one of the executioners in the face and he stumbled back,\ncatching the lever with his elbow. The trapdoor fell open but Wetterlant\nwasn’t quite in position. He gave a muffled cry as one of his legs dropped,\nbut his other foot stayed on the scaffold and he ended up halfway through,\ntwisting and jerking with his knee trapped under his chin and the rope\nalmost but not quite taut.\nThe crowd gave half a great cheer to see him drop, then half a great boo\nto see he hadn’t quite dropped, then laughter and taunts and more food flung\nwhile the Inquisitor bellowed at the executioners to no effect.\nOrso’s mother closed her eyes, delicately pressed her middle finger to\nher forehead and swore softly in Styrian. Orso could only stare. This was\nhis reign so far. When he finally decided to hang a man he hadn’t wanted to\nhang in the first place, he couldn’t even manage it without the whole\nbusiness descending into farce. He jumped to his feet in a sudden rage. “For\nthe Fates’ sakes, just get it done!”\nBut Wetterlant was wedged in the trapdoor and the executioners had no\nsolution. One of them wrestled pointlessly with the lever, the other had the\nprisoner under the arms, trying to drag him out, another was kicking at the\none leg still wedged above the trapdoor, trying to shove it through.\nMeanwhile, he was making a high-pitched squealing, the rope not quite\ntight around his neck and the front of his hood wildly flapping with his\ndesperate breath.\nOne of the nobles from the Open Council—Barezin, maybe—was on his\nfeet and roaring his outrage but was entirely inaudible over the screeching\ncommoners, who were pelting the scaffold with rotten food. There was a\nshriek, followed by another surge through the crowd but wilder, arms\nflailing. A fight breaking out and quickly spreading.\nPeople were throwing things at the nobles’ enclosure now. Not only fruit\nbut coins. Stones. Orso heard a bottle shatter. He saw someone stumbling\nfrom their seat with blood on their face."

He saw someone stumbling\nfrom their seat with blood on their face.\nWith a final vicious kick, one of the executioners managed to free\nWetterlant’s leg and he vanished beneath the platform, the rope snapping\ntaut. There was a half-hearted whoop in some quarters, but it hardly\nregistered above the mounting chaos in the square. One could almost have\ndescribed it as a riot now, a seething mass of flailing bodies with soldiers\nstraining at the periphery, people scrambling for safety in every direction.\nHe thought he heard someone shout, “The Breakers!”\nA missile thudded against the sun-stitched cloth of gold that hung behind\nOrso. He felt wet in his hair and jerked away, shocked. A bleeding head\nwound might have offered some romance, but he rather suspected it was\nrotten fruit.\nOrso’s mother pushed her chin even higher, as though daring them with\na bigger target. “Are they throwing things at us?”\nHe distinctly heard a shout of, “Down with King Orso!” but had no idea\nwhere it came from. It could have been commoner or noble. He would\nhardly have blamed his mother if she had chosen that moment to come out\nagainst him.\nHe definitely heard a scream of, “Fuck the Young Lamb!” Black-clothed\nPracticals were shoving through the press, laying about them with sticks\nand fists, dragging struggling figures from the chaos. Orso saw a group of\nmen break through the line of soldiers and go sprawling at the foot of the\nscaffold, punching and wrestling. Gorst loomed up, shielding Orso and his\nmother with his armoured body.\n“Your Majesties,” he squeaked. “Time to depart.”\nOrso wearily nodded. “Damn it, but I hate hangings.”\nOld Ways, Proper Ways\nR\nikke sat with her boots off on her father’s bench as the War Chiefs came\nin, trimming her toenails. Isern sat on the floor to her left with her spear\nacross her knees, Shivers stood on her right with his thumbs in his sword-\nbelt. By the dead, she was glad they were there. No better pair in the Circle\nof the World to have on your flanks, and both good and ready for their part\nin what was coming.\nFirst came Red Hat, then Oxel, then Hardbread. Rikke beckoned ’em\nforward, friendly as she could. Men used to smile at her a lot. But the old\nwarriors had that nervous air folk tended to have around her since she lost\none eye and had the runes pricked around the other. Like if they turned their\nback on her she might bite their arses.\n“Sorry to keep you boys waiting,” she said, though few men had ever\nlooked less like boys, there was scarcely one dark hair on the three.\n“Well,” grunted Oxel as their Named Men crowded silent and suspicious\ninto the hall behind, “join the Union or join the North. It’s a big choice to\nmake.”\n“And up till now it’s been little choices for me.” Rikke tossed her\nscissors down and crossed her legs. “What song to sing or how short to trim\nmy toenails or which eye to have pricked out o’ my head.”"

Then she slumped back on her bench.\n“Trouble with visions, though, they’re like those little goats the hillmen\nkeep. Stubborn shits, they are. There’s just no rushing ’em.”\nOxel frowned over at Red Hat and Red Hat frowned back, and behind\nthem their warriors copied their chiefs, as warriors are prone to do. It was\nan awful lot of frowns for that one room to hold.\n“But then I realised!” Rikke sprang up on her bare feet on the bench,\nmaking ’em all jump. “This is the North! Who needs the Long Eye? We’ve\ngot ways of settling questions up here.”\n“Proper ways,” croaked Shivers, red stone glinting on his finger as he\nshifted his thumbs around the worn buckle of his sword-belt.\n“Old ways,” sang Isern-i-Phail, and she spat chagga juice and wiped her\nlip.\n“Time-tested traditions!” Rikke wagged a finger at the old men like\nthey’d strayed from the pasture and she was there to play shepherd. “My\nfather always used to say, you want things right, you have to put ’em right\nyourself. No better way to settle a difference of opinion…” And she made a\nring with her finger and thumb and peered at ’em through it with the one\neye that still could. “Than in the Circle!”\nThere was no instant enthusiasm from the three old War Chiefs.\nHardbread was light on enthusiasm, instant or otherwise, and for the other\ntwo, a fight to the death is a notion that usually takes some working up to.\n“The Circle?” Red Hat rested a hand on the pommel of his sword, and\nthe Named Men filled the hall to the rafters with a nervy murmur.\n“It’s a bit like a square, but with no corners,” said Rikke. “You can step\ninside and settle this man to man. Ideas can contend! Then rather’n a war\nand all our strength wasted, we can march into the future arm in arm. For\nwhatever my say’s worth, I’ll throw it behind the winner. Hardbread? You\nhappy to do the same?”\nHardbread looked the opposite of happy. “I’d rather find some path that\ndon’t need any more blood spilled—”\n“So’d we all. But up here in the North, most paths worth taking turn out\nat least a little bloody.”\nNo one disagreed with that. How could they? Hardbread wearily sagged.\n“I reckon. If neither o’ you twain back down.”\nNeither of the two old warriors looked like backing down a hair. A grey\nhair, obviously. Red Hat puffed up his chest and shifted his fist from his\nsword’s pommel to its grip with a warlike rattle. “Guess we’d better pick a\ntime and a place—”\nIsern whipped back a big canvas sheet and sent straw scattering.\nUnderneath was the Circle she’d marked out that morning, five strides"

Or can we get straight to the bloodshed?”\nOxel stretched up his chin and scratched at the white beard on his neck.\nPlain he wasn’t much enjoying this sudden rush into death’s cold embrace\nbut could see no way to stop it, either. A War Chief’s fame is all built on\nfighting, after all. Backing down from a fight could be the end of him. “We\ncan get straight to it,” he growled, and drew his sword.\nRed Hat drew his at about the same moment. “Aye. Let’s settle it here\nand now.”\n“Shields for the rest o’ you, then!” cried Isern, clapping her hands. “And\ninto the Circle with our two grey champions!”\nThere was none of the usual trading of insults as Oxel’s men and Red\nHat’s slid their shields onto their arms and made a wall around the Circle’s\nedge. All shocked into quiet at how quick this had come about.\nOxel worked his head around with a click of neck bones. Red Hat undid\nthe golden buckle on his cloak and tossed it over his shoulder to one of his\nmen. Both of ’em bristled like they were still as brimming with vinegar at\nsixty as they’d been at twenty, and both of ’em quite clearly weren’t. Maybe\nif they had been they wouldn’t have got so easily prodded into fighting each\nother. But then getting warriors to fight has always been easy. It’s stopping\nthe bastards that’s the tougher trick.\n“Well, here is a business the moon can smile upon!” called Isern. “We\nall know what the matter is and we all know what hangs on the result. Get\nto it!” She slipped from the Circle giving no one any time for second\nthoughts, and the shields were locked together behind her, metal rims\nscraping, painted faces pointing in.\nWith some reluctance, the two old War Chiefs began to circle, Red Hat\nwith his sword point up, Oxel with his out to the side. They circled closer,\nOxel with his teeth bared and Red Hat’s tongue working at his lower lip.\nThey circled, closer yet, then Red Hat stabbed and Oxel parried, chopped\nback and Red Hat ducked away. Shield-carriers gasped, and shields scraped\nas the circle flexed and shifted, then the noise mounted, men behind\npressing in, and calling out, and shaking their fists, then grunting and\nshouting and bellowing encouragement till there was a roaring in the hall"

Still smelled\nlike him, somehow. She wished for a moment he could be woken, and\nthought of him striding in to see what all the fuss was about. Thought of\nhim smiling at her the way he used to, like she was the most precious thing\nhe had. The most precious thing there was. Then she wondered if he would\nsmile, when he saw her blinded eye and the runes on her face. Wondered if\nhe’d have stared, fearful and queasy like everyone else. The thought made a\ntear gather in her blind eye that she had to dab away.\nBy then, she wasn’t the only one leaking. Blood was trickling from Red\nHat’s sleeve and tip-tapping from his fingertips, and Oxel had a red mouth\nfrom an elbow and was carrying a bit of a limp. Almost made Rikke feel\nbad, setting two old men to kill each other, but she had to make of her heart\na stone. Someone had to steer Uffrith now her father was gone.\nSteel clanged and the two old War Chiefs groaned, tottered and wrestled,\ntired and clumsy. Bit of an unedifying spectacle, all in all. There’s a reason\nfighting mostly gets left to the young. Oxel’s chest heaved, his sword\ndrooped. Red Hat’s twisted face glimmered with sweat as he gathered\nhimself for one more effort, but it was clear where it’d fall. He swung\noverhand and Oxel stumbled out of the way. He barely even thrust, really, it\nwas more that Red Hat slipped, and as luck would have it, he fell right onto\nOxel’s sword. Luck can be quite the dodgy bitch, after all.\nThe blade slid right through him, and Red Hat’s jacket stuck out to a\nglinting point behind his back, then the whole thing started turning red, not\njust his hood. His face went pink, veins bulging from his neck, and he tried\nto speak, but just spluttered blood onto the ground.\nOxel ripped his blade back and Red Hat tottered, sword hanging from\nhis hand and the point scraping the floor. He coughed and retched, like he\ncouldn’t get a breath. He gave a hissing groan as he lifted his sword one\nmore time, and Oxel took a cautious step back, but all Red Hat did was fish\nat the air with it, then turn all the way around and crash onto his side. Blood\ntrickled out of his mouth and spread down the cracks between the stones\naround him, and his eyes goggled at nothing.\n“Reckon Uffrith won’t be joining the Union, anyway,” said Isern,\nleaning on her spear.\nOxel’s men sent up a great cheer. Red Hat’s drooped, sullen and silent.\nRikke had always liked Red Hat. He’d laughed at her jokes when she was a\ngirl. He’d talked with her father into the night, firelight on their lined faces."

But someone had to steer Uffrith now, and it\ncouldn’t be him.\n“I win!” roared Oxel, holding up his bloody sword. “I fucking win! Send\nword to the Great Wolf that we’re joining the North and—”\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” called Rikke, holding her palms high and\nbringing every face towards her. “Let’s not dash off ahead of ourselves. I\nnever agreed to that.”\n“You said you’d fall behind the winner!”\n“I said ideas should contend. I didn’t say there were only two.”\nOxel’s face twisted. “What the fuck do you mean, girl?”\n“Red Hat said join the Union. You said join the North. Spat it at me over\nmy father’s grave, as I recall.” She gave it a moment, feeling her own heart\nthumping hard in her chest, then shrugged as if she hadn’t a care. “I say we\nstay as we are. As my father wanted us. Independent.”\n“Who fights for that?” sneered Oxel. “You?”\n“A woman, in the Circle? Wouldn’t dream o’ polluting the proud\ninstitution by sticking my tits in it. First step in getting anything done is\nknowing what you can’t do, and I wouldn’t last two breaths in there wi’\nyou. Reckon I’ll leave it to my champion.” And Shivers brushed one of Red\nHat’s shield-carriers out of his way and stepped past, grey sword drawn and\nhanging by his side. “I mean, why even have a champion if he doesn’t fight\nyour duels?”\nA mutter went through the watching men. Oxel’s men, and Red Hat’s,\nand Hardbread’s, and the rest. Fear, and anger, and excitement, too. The\nBloody-Nine was the worst man in the world to find yourself in the Circle\nwith. But Caul Shivers came a close second.\n“You tricky bitch!” snarled Oxel.\nRikke laughed. “Aye, Tricky Rikke. But this is the North! Tricks are a\ntradition even older and more proper than duels.” She let her smile fade.\n“My father fought all his life so we could be free. Fought his friends and his\nenemies. Fought Black Dow, and Black Calder, and Scale Ironhand, and\nStour Nightfall, and never lost. Gave everything for it. Gave till he was a\nhusk. Think I’m going to give up what he gave me just ’cause you ask?”\nShe curled back her lips and screamed it, spraying spit. “You didn’t even\nfucking ask nicely!”\nOxel worked his mouth. “We’ll see, you little cunt.”\n“I do the seeing.” Rikke nodded at Shivers. “The dead are blind.”\nTo be fair, Oxel gave her a shock of his own by springing forward\nwithout even waiting for Red Hat’s corpse to get dragged out, lashing at\nShivers’ blind side with everything he had.

No\ndoubt he was right.\nIt was a good effort, but Shivers was fresher, and stronger, and quicker,\nand Rikke never yet saw him surprised. He caught Oxel’s sword with his\nown, metal squealing as he steered it wide to hack a long scar in one of the\nshields at the edge of the Circle.\nOxel righted himself as Shivers stepped back into space, weighing his\nsword, the bright rune near the hilt glinting on the dull blade. “Come on,\nyou bastard!” he snarled. “Come on, you half-blind maggot! I’ll cut a new\narse in you!”\nShivers wasted no breath on hard words. Just watched. Calm as a\nfisherman waiting for the tide.\nOxel came on, feinted low but swung high. Rikke gasped, sure he’d\ncaught Shivers in the face, knowing the future of Uffrith, not to mention her\nown, was hanging by a thread. But Shivers whipped back from the waist at\nthe last moment, let the blade whistle past his nose, let Oxel stumble after it.\nCaul Shivers wasn’t Stour Nightfall. If he’d ever had a mind to show\noff, he’d left it far in the past with his other eye.\nHis sword chopped deep into Oxel’s side, under his ribs, specks of blood\nspattering the gawping faces of his shield-carriers.\nOxel staggered sideways, giving a bubbling wheeze, clutching at his\nside and the blood leaking dark between his fingers. He tried a despairing\nlunge, all off balance, but Shivers stepped around it, pinned Oxel’s right\narm under his left, lifted his sword high and clubbed Oxel on the crown of\nhis head with the pommel.\nSounded like someone hitting a pot with a hammer. Oxel’s sword\nclattered to the ground and he dropped to his knees, blood bubbling through\nhis hair and running down his face in red streaks. He gave a funny slurp and\nlooked up at Rikke.\n“You—”\nShivers’ sword pinged as it took Oxel’s head off and sent it bouncing\nacross the circle. One of Red Hat’s shield-carriers jumped out of the way to\nlet it roll past. Shivers turned to Oxel’s men as their chief’s body flopped\nsideways. He didn’t roar in triumph or throw his arms up in victory or\nbellow insults. Just looked at ’em, like he was making an offer, and wasn’t\nmuch bothered either way whether anyone took him up on it.\nNo one did a thing. No one said a thing. Just a long silence as the wash\nof blood from Oxel’s corpse became a stream, then a trickle, a great slick of\nit joining with Red Hat’s and slowly spreading.\nRikke put her hand on Shivers’ shoulder and slipped past him, padding\ninto the centre of the Circle.\n“Any more ideas need testing?” she asked, turning all the way around so\neveryone got the chance to speak."

But no one\ndid a thing. No one said a thing.\n“Anyone else want to go their own way?”\nHer mouth was dry and her pulse thumped in her skull. But there was\nsilence like winter. Silence like death.\n“No more opinions? No one?”\nThe Named Men shuffled meek out of her path, shields limp on their\narms, as Rikke wandered back to her bench, bare feet leaving a trail of\nbloody footprints across the floor of her father’s hall.\n“What happens now?” muttered Hardbread, staring at the two corpses\nand clutching at his sparse white hair.\n“I know exactly what’ll happen,” said Rikke, even if a lot of it was a sea\nof doubts, and she sat back down and dragged that sheepskin around her\nshoulders. “I’ve seen it.”\n“What have you seen?” asked one of Red Hat’s men. Angry at what had\nhappened, maybe, but with a touch of curiosity in his voice, too. A needy\nlittle whine. In the end, no matter what they say, most folk want a path to\nfollow. Someone to tell ’em it’ll all be fine. Someone to tell ’em what to do.\n“I know you lot love to worry, but you can stop now.” Rikke tipped her\nhead on one side and smiled. She didn’t have to put any threat in it. The\nrunes on her face did that for her. Well, the runes and the two corpses and\nShivers standing speckled with their blood. “All you have to do is what I\ntell you. You can do that, can’t you?”\nLike Rikke’s father used to say, you want things right, you have to put\n’em right yourself. She took up her scissors, and brought her knee up to her\nchin, and set to trimming her toenails again. The big one on her left foot had\nthis funny little spike of skin at the corner. Always took a while to shape it\nnicely.\nFire with Fire\n“Y\nou’re a magus, then?” asked Stour.\n“The Magus Radierus, at your service!” No doubt he sounded the part,\nmaking quite the meal from every “r” passed through his mouth, and he\nlooked the part, too. Robe with all sorts of gold thread in it, and a big long\nbeard forked and streaked with white, and a twisted staff with a sort of\ncrystal on the end.\n“So you can do magic?” Stour had his sword drawn. He loved to keep it\ndrawn, which seemed folly to Clover. The big advantage of a sword over an\naxe, after all, is that you can sheathe the bastard thing and not make\neveryone nervous. But making everyone nervous was one o’ the Great\nWolf’s favourite pastimes, sword’s point resting on the flagstones beside\nSkarling’s chair, toying with the pommel, turning it so the blade flashed and\nflickered. Sometimes when the sun hit the windows right, he’d catch it on\nhis sword and shine it in people’s eyes, just because.\n“Not only magic.” The old man sounded pretty confident as he wafted"

Sometimes when the sun hit the windows right, he’d catch it on\nhis sword and shine it in people’s eyes, just because.\n“Not only magic.” The old man sounded pretty confident as he wafted\nhis staff about. “But the High Art of Juvens!” There was quite the sheen of\nsweat across his forehead, though.\n“Show me,” said Stour. Clover didn’t much like the way this was going.\nThe old man closed his eyes, muttering some words Clover couldn’t\nunderstand, waved his free hand with much to-do, then flung something into\nthe air in a puff of glittering dust. It was a little bird, which flapped about a\nbit and ended up sitting puzzled on one of the rafters.\n“That’s nice,” said Clover.\nBeside him, Black Calder took another swig of ale and disgustedly\nshook his head. “By all the fucking dead.”\n“I thought it was nice.”\nStour, it seemed, did not agree. He narrowed his eyes the way he did\nwhen someone was about to get hurt, which wasn’t rarely. “I heard tell you\ncould disappear.”\n“Well… er…” The eyes of the magus darted nervously about. “Only\nunder certain conditions, my king. Auspicious moments in the moon’s\ncycle, you understand, when the stars align, and—”\n“Hit him,” said Stour.\nGreenway’s fist smacked into the old man’s cheek and knocked him flat\non his back, robes flapping and his staff clattering down, the crystal on the\nend jolting loose and skittering away into a corner.\n“I just do tricks!” he squealed as Greenway dragged him up again, his\nmagnificence somewhat spoiled by a bloody mouth. “In a travelling show!\nIt’s not magic. Not really.” His “r” sounds weren’t too clever any more.\nNone of his sounds were. “I’m not a magus! I can disappear, but… it’s a\nbox with a fake bottom—”\nStour’s lip curled. “Get this old halfhead out o’ my sight.”\nGreenway caught the would-be magus around the neck and hauled him\ntowards the door, heels helplessly kicking. Turned out he could disappear\nafter all. Clover felt the twitch of a smile, almost turned around to toss the\njoke at Wonderful. Then he remembered he’d killed her.\nBlack Calder gave a great scornful snort as Radierus was dragged out,\nmaking Stour frown over. “Something tickling you, Father?”\n“Aye, rounding up magicians.” Calder snorted again. “Quite the bloody\njoke.”\n“You could skip to the punchline right now. Head to the Great Northern\nLibrary and bring your friend the First of the Magi to see me.”\nThe scorn slipped from Calder’s face and left him grim. “Bayaz is no\nfriend of mine. No friend of anyone’s. His help’ll cost far more than it’s\nworth. Cost you everything. Better off shaking hands with the plague.”\n“The Dogman’s daughter has the Long Eye,” said Stour, and a few of his\nwarriors muttered and grumbled unhappily. “I have to fight fire with fire.”\n“That’ll win you naught but ashes,” said Calder. “There’s not much"

You’d best\nhope all you find is tricks and liars.” And he sank further into his seat and\ntook another swig of ale. Seemed with his brother back to the mud, he was\nset on keeping the breweries in business himself.\nGreenway was marching the next magician in, and she looked a lot less\npromising than the last. A sturdy woman with a ragged dress and dirty bare\nfeet who couldn’t tear her big round eyes away from the cage in the corner.\nGregun Hollowhead wasn’t in it any more. His head was rotting on a spike\nover the gates of Carleon. But one of his Named Men had come to complain\nabout it so the cage had a new guest, starved and battered, one scabbed leg\ndangling from the bottom and nearly scraping the sticky stones underneath.\n“Who’s this one?” asked Stour, rubbing at his chin. He’d grown himself\na little bit of beard, just under his mouth, while he shaved the rest. Clover\ncouldn’t understand it. Grow it or don’t, but why leave bits? It was like\nleaving your wife half-fucked. But then, Clover had given up on trying to\nwork out why anyone did anything, especially Stour.\n“She’s from a village up near Yaws,” said Greenway.\n“That so?” asked the Great Wolf, considering her with his bright, wet\neyes.\n“Her name’s Seff.”\nCalder sat up, looking sharply over. “Huh,” grunted Stour. “That was my\nmother’s name.”\n“Good sign, I guess,” said Greenway.\n“It’s just a fucking name, fool. I’ve heard tell you can see things, Seff\nfrom up near Yaws.”\nShe glanced around the hard faces in the room. No one could’ve looked\nmore terrified, and Clover didn’t blame her. “Well… sometimes I do… I\nreckon…”\nCalder sank back with another great snort of contempt, made his son\nbare his teeth in frustration. “What do you see?”\n“One time, I saw the village burning,” said Seff from up near Yaws,\n“and the next day men came, and… well, they burned the village.”\n“Saved everyone, then?”\nShe swallowed. “Well, no, ’cause no one believed me.”\n“Guess that’s their fault, eh?”\n“I reckon…”\nStour sat forward. “You heard there’s a witch down in Uffrith?”\n“The Dogman’s daughter?” Seff from up near Yaws nervously licked her\nlips. “I heard she’s got the Long Eye. Got it real and true, like back in the\nOld Time. Heard she can see what a man’s thinking. Heard she can stay dry\nin the rain ’cause she knows where all the drops’ll fall. Heard she’s got\neverything that’ll happen written in a golden book and all she has to do is\nlook it up so—”\n“That’s all shit!” barked Stour, straining forward with the veins bulging\nfrom his neck, making everyone in the hall jump. “But she can see things."

Only reason I lost that duel.” He got\nup, pulling that fine wolfskin cloak about him, the point of his sword\nscraping on the old stones as he stepped down from the dais. “If she can see\nthings… I need to see things, you understand? So tell me…” Stour stopped\nin front of Seff, the hall all quiet. “What do you see?”\n“Nothing,” she whispered, shifting from one bare foot to the other,\nstaring down at them all the while like she was hoping if she couldn’t see\nStour he wasn’t actually there. “I mean… you can’t force the Long Eye to\nopen.”\n“You can’t?” hissed Stour, leaning close and making her shrink away.\n“Or you won’t?”\n“I’d help if I could, but I don’t know how.” Her face crushed up and her\nvoice got higher and higher. “It comes when it comes. I just want… to go\nback to my children.” She closed her eyes and squeezed tears down her\ncheeks, and Clover winced and turned his face away. “Please don’t kill me.”\nStour frowned then, and he put a finger under the woman’s chin and\ntipped her face up, so she had no choice but to look into his eyes. “Is that\nwhat you think o’ me?”\nShe stared at him, gooseflesh on her arms and her shuddering breath\nechoing around the hall.\n“Look, I’ll confess I kill folk,” and Stour nudged at the bloody straw on\nthe floor like he was trying to hide the stain. “But only when there’s\nsomething to gain by it. I kill folk who wrong me. Who stand against me,\nlike that shit in the cage over there and his fool of a chief. I don’t kill folk\nwho do what they’re told. I’m not the Bloody-Nine!” And he gave that great\nhungry grin of his, which was anything but a reassurance. “Greenway?”\n“My king?”\n“Give this girl a coin and send her back to her children, eh?” Stour\npatted her face and wiped some of the tears away with his thumb. “You\ntried, didn’t you? That’s all I can ask. You see anything, you let me know,\neh?”\nShe closed her eyes, and wiped her runny nose, and nodded, and\nGreenway led her shuffling out, and all the way, Clover was wincing, half-\nexpecting Stour to run up and stab her in the back out of pure meanness.\nMaybe he would’ve, too, if someone coming in hadn’t caught his eye.\nThey called him Dancer on account of his slick way of moving, but\nthere was naught graceful about him then, edging around the doorway,\ntrying and failing to be one with the shadows. There was a certain look\nmessengers got when they had news the Great Wolf wouldn’t want to hear.\n“Dancer!” called Stour. “You’re back, then.”\n“Aye… just got here…”\n“And? What did Oxel say?”"

What did Oxel say?”\nDancer crept out to that bloody spot on the floor of Skarling’s Hall, no\nmore eager than Seff from Yaws had been. “Oxel’s dead.”\nThere was a silence. Clover heard his own breath as he sucked it in. The\nwind sighed cold through the high windows. The river whispered at the\nbase of the cliff beyond. Then the Great Wolf showed his teeth, and caught\na fistful of Dancer’s shirt, and dragged him close.\n“He’s fucking what?”\n“Caul Shivers killed him! Cut his head off in the Circle!”\n“How’d that old idiot get himself in the Circle with Caul fucking\nShivers?”\n“Rikke tricked him into it!” squealed Dancer. Before Clover saw her\nwith the runes on her face, he would’ve laughed at that. But he wasn’t\nlaughing now. No one was. Specially not Dancer. “Well, she tricked him\nand Red Hat into it, then Oxel killed Red Hat, then Shivers killed—”\n“Red Hat’s dead as well?”\n“She’s took her father’s hall. She’s took her father’s land. She’s said\nUffrith’s going its own way—”\n“She’s fucking what?” snarled Stour.\nAnd Black Calder burst out laughing. Started with a snort on his ale,\nthen became a giggle, then a chuckle, and soon enough was a full head-back\nbelly laugh. Wasn’t a sound you heard too often in Skarling’s Hall these\ndays. Unless it was Stour laughing at something dead.\n“What’s funny?” he snapped at his father.\n“Far as the Long Eye goes, I’ve got my doubts,” said Calder, sighing as\nhe stood. “But that girl’s got a sharp mind and a hard heart.” He waved over\nhis shoulder as he headed for the door. “Let me know when you’re bored of\nruining things. I’ll do my best to stitch ’em back together.”\nHalf-Treason\n“I\nhave been so looking forward to seeing you again!” said Isold.\nSavine leaned close to touch the back of her hand. “I have been ticking\noff the moments.”\n“I feel, since we were married together… we have a special bond.”\n“Like the sister I never had.” The bland, talentless, uninspiring sister she\nnever had and did not particularly want.\nIsold gave Savine a shy smile, all freckly blush and eyelash. “Fedor was\ndesperate to visit Ostenhorm. He thinks of you and Leo as our closest\nfriends.”\nSnakes have no friends. It made Savine wonder what Isher was really up\nto. Most of Angland’s serious business was done here in the Lady’s\nChamber these days, between Savine and a few chosen people, on its\ncarefully curated furniture in the light of its new, thoroughly modern\nwindows. But just this once she would much rather have been on the other\nside of the connecting door, in the panelled gloom of the Lord’s Chamber,\npuzzling out how exactly Isold’s husband meant to take advantage of hers."

It had made\nSavine feel oddly excited herself, wondering if a splash of real politics was\nabout to upset the placid little pond of Angland.\n“I hope you don’t think me too forward but… might I be right in\nthinking…” Isold glanced down significantly at Savine’s stomach.\n“I am.” There was simply no hiding it any more, and Savine was rather\nenjoying letting it show. She had expected to be thoroughly annoyed,\nwatching her body stolen more each day by a selfish little parasite. But\nthere was something oddly comforting about her bulging belly. She was\neven finding herself singing to it, from time to time. The other day, she had\nfelt it move. Savine raised her brows as she gently stroked it. “Who knew\nthe key to happiness was looser clothes? How are things in Midderland?”\nshe asked, trying not to sound eager. “Sometimes I feel as if I am stranded\non the island of Shabulyan! I understand Wetterlant’s hanging was a fiasco.”\n“A disaster.” Isold leaned across to give a shrill whisper. “Queen Terez\nwas pelted with rubbish. Breakers in the crowd, is the rumour.”\n“Are they sure it wasn’t members of the Open Council?”\nIsold gave a guilty titter. “Arch Lector Glokta—that is, your father—has\nbeen granted more powers, and the King’s Own have been split up and sent\ninto Keln, and Valbeck, and out on the streets of Adua. There are curfews\nand searches and roundings-up. It’s, well… it’s a nervous atmosphere. I’m\ntrying to persuade Fedor to spend more time at our estates in the country,\nbut he insists on doing everything he can to help.”\nTo help himself, no doubt. “Your husband is a true patriot.”\n“As is yours, of course. I should retire.”\n“Really?” Isold was tepid but Savine had hoped to pick up some more\ngossip. She had relished the challenge of taking charge in Ostenhorm, but\nnow she was undisputed mistress here she was teetering on the edge of\nboredom. She missed being at the heart of things. She missed the rush of\nthe gamble and the thrill of the win. She missed her friends, her\nacquaintances, even her enemies. Her enemies most of all, perhaps. “It’s\nbarely even dusk.”\n“I know, but I hope that I might be in… a delicate condition myself.”\nIsold was turning pink at the thought, poor thing. “My husband wants me to\nhave plenty of rest.”\n“Of course.” Though no one had ever fallen pregnant as a result of rest,\nas far as Savine was aware.\n“Perhaps we might celebrate the births of our first children together, as\nwell as our marriage?”\n“We can hope.” Though since Savine had been with child several\nmonths before her wedding it did not seem terribly likely.

She kept the\nsmile clamped to her face until Isold was gone, then she stood, pushed the\nheels of her hands into her aching back, and went straight to the connecting\ndoor. She had planned to sweep through and take her share of the\nconversation by force, but there was something secretive to Leo and Isher’s\nhushed tones that made her hold back. She ever so gently eased the door\nopen a crack instead.\n“… The Dogman’s gone back to the mud.” Leo spoke in an urgent\nmurmur. “His daughter Rikke’s in charge in Uffrith.”\n“Could you get her support?” asked Isher.\nSavine frowned. Was Leo planning some move against the Northmen?\nAs he was always saying, he was the worst man in the world at doing\nnothing.\n“I think so. We were close once.”\n“And Uffrith still needs your protection. What about Stour?”\n“He owes me his life. And he’s a man who loves war.”\n“We need him, Leo. Find a way to bring him onto our side. Whatever it\ncosts.”\nSavine’s eyes widened. They were building an alliance, but with the\nNorthmen.\n“What about the Open Council?” asked Leo.\n“Fifteen of us committed now,” came Isher’s voice, “but we must move\nwith the utmost care. There are laws restricting the raising of private armies,\nand we cannot risk making Old Sticks suspicious.”\nSavine felt the hairs prickling on the back of her neck.\nShe had known ever since Wetterlant’s trial that Isher was planning\nsomething. She had thought it strange Leo was so reluctant to disband\nAngland’s regiments. She had guessed they were about some secret\nbusiness. But she had never dreamed it might be something so audacious.\nSo enormous. So incredibly dangerous. This was not a splash of politics, it\nwas a great wave that might sweep everything away!\n“We need to move now,” growled Leo. “Every day we could be\ndiscovered.”\n“Patience, my friend. Your enthusiasm is infectious, but we must not be\nrash. We have to gather every possible ally, wait for the clearest summer\nweather, then move on Adua without a backward glance.”\nSavine’s eyes widened. By the Fates, they were talking of revolt. Open\nrebellion against the Crown. Leo would be turning on Orso. He would be\nturning on her father. He would be gambling everything on one mad throw\nof the dice. Did he have any idea what he was contemplating? It was\nnothing less than treason!\nAn investor must know an opportunity when she sees it, must judge the\nrisks and rewards in an instant. Fast now, with her breath coming sharp in\nher tight throat, the choices flashed through Savine’s mind.\nDo nothing? Retire to bed like Isold and pretend she never heard? Sit\nback like the good wife and let Leo manage their affairs?\nNo.\nReason with him, then? Enlist Lady Finree’s help and persuade him to\nabandon this madness?

Dragged herself back to the top.\nBecause of her husband’s folly, was she to lose that, too?\nNo.\nWhich left one choice only.\nShe slipped the box from her sleeve with trembling fingers, dug out a\nhuge pinch of pearl dust and turned from the door to snort it up. An investor\nmust know an opportunity when she sees it, must judge the risks and\nrewards in an instant, and if one outweighs the other pounce upon it,\ncommit without delay, without regret, without sentiment.\nRevolt.

Or was it an almost\nunbearable thrill?\n“Calm,” she whispered. “Calm, calm, calm.”\nIt was a risk. An awful risk. Yet she could not help but think of all there\nmight be to gain. No less than everything, if she played her hand well…\nThe Closed Council had made many enemies, within the Union’s borders\nand without. Had her father not often listed them, discussed with her their\nfears and desires, their strengths and weaknesses? If they all could be\nbrought together, pushed in the same direction at the same moment… It\nwould take a delicate touch. Something Leo by no means had.\nBut that was why he had her.\nShe set her shoulders, swung the door wide and stepped through.\nSavine had not changed this room. Probably no one had changed it in\ntwo centuries. Some dark oils of dead Lord Governors, some gruesome-\nlooking Northern swords and shields looted from some old battlefield, some\ninexpertly stuffed hunting trophies, peering disapprovingly down with their\nbland glass eyes. An upset deer, an astonished stag, a baffled bear, a leering\nwolf. Leo had told her it was the way his father had liked it, and so it was\nthe way he liked it, and she respected his decision. Or at least pretended to.\n“My lords.” She calmly shut the door and walked smiling over, keeping\na mask of dignified composure clamped over her feverish anxiety, to perch\non an ancient chair that had by no means been designed for the clothes of a\nmodern lady.

A look men often had when she opened\nnegotiations with them. A look she always enjoyed wiping from the faces of\npeople who supposed themselves powerful. “Lady Savine, I hardly think—”\n“The two of you plan to risk everything you have. Therefore, you plan to\nrisk everything I have. My future. The future of my child. It is clear you\nhave already taken several steps along this path. Too far to turn back\nwithout considerable danger. Perhaps too far to turn back at all. So. It seems\nyou have left me no choice but to commit myself to this project and do\neverything possible to make sure it succeeds.” She raised her chin. “But if\nyou think I would ever do so without voicing my opinion, you are\nprofoundly mistaken.”\nIsher narrowed his eyes. “You would have to turn against your father—”\n“That is between me and him.” Her father, if she even considered him\nher father, could hardly complain. He had been lecturing her about the value\nof ruthlessness since she was knee-high. “Now tell me your plans.”\nLeo sat forward with the eagerness of a boy keen to show off a new\ngame. “We have the Open Council. We have the army of Angland, the best\nsoldiers in the Union. We’ll bring Rikke and Stour and all their Northmen\nonto our side. We’ll land on the north coast of Midderland, gather our\nfriends as we march on Adua and take the Closed Council by surprise,\nforcing Orso to concede to our demands without a drop of blood spilled!”\nSavine took a sip of her drink, worked it around her mouth and\nswallowed. “That sounds… optimistic.” She had managed to take her father\nby surprise perhaps four or five times in her life. The idea of Leo achieving\nit bordered on absurd. “You rather assume that experienced politicians and\nsoldiers will play into your hands.”\n“We have a secret weapon!” Leo thumped the table. “Lord Isher has a\nfriend on the Closed Council.”\nIsher sourly worked his mouth. Plainly he trusted her no further than she\ntrusted him, but that hardly mattered. There were few of her many business\npartners she would have trusted to hold her hat, and they still made money\nfor each other. “A good friend,” he said, reluctantly. “We know everything\nthey do.”\n“Orso is no soldier,” said Leo, scornfully.\n“He’s no politician, either. Only see what happened at Wetterlant’s trial.”\nIsher gave a disgusted sneer. “The man’s a fool.”\n“A coward.”\n“He is neither,” snapped Savine. “Indecisive, perhaps, but he is clever,\nand he has iron in him. The tougher things get, the tougher he will become.”"

The tougher things get, the tougher he will become.”\n“Thought you were done taking his side?” grumbled Leo.\n“Never fear your enemy,” said Savine, “but always respect him.\nStolicus, I believe? If we mean to risk everything, we cannot simply assume\nour enemies will fail. We must stack the deck so heavily in our favour that\nwe can only win.” She considered the collection of battered weaponry on\nthe walls, already working the problem through from every angle. “The\nUnion is flooded with idle veterans. Men who have returned from war to\nfind a changed world in which they have no place. I suggest the Open\nCouncil asks leave to raise troops to protect their interests from the\nBreakers. To quash riots and root out dissent. A pretext for arming\nyourselves which will make the Closed Council trust you more rather than\nless.”\nLeo raised his brows at Isher, who was moving from scornful to\nthoughtful. “Neat,” he conceded.\n“I will arrange for a concerted campaign of pamphlets and newsbills that\ncan keep the embers of resentment hot. Blame the Closed Council for the\nstate of the nation. Blame the debt to Valint and Balk. Remind the people of\nthe hanged outside Valbeck. Remind the nobles of the injustice against\nWetterlant. Queen Terez is always a popular target. King Orso, too.” It gave\nher a twinge of regret. But she told herself they would be fighting for their\nlives. No weapon could be beneath them.\nLeo grinned. “I hear that etchings speak directly to the heart.”\n“The filthier the better,” said Savine. “King Jezal was a bastard, we can\ndig up doubts about the line of succession.” Who would know better than\nshe did how destructive such doubts could become, after all? “I will write to\nMaster Sworbreck and keep his presses hot. But even so, Lord Isher, you\nare right that we will need every ally. From what I heard, there are two\npotential ones you have left out. The Styrians. And the Breakers\nthemselves.”\n“The Breakers?” Leo looked almost as astonished as the stuffed stag’s\nhead over his shoulder. “They’re traitors!”\nSavine did not make the obvious point that they were not the only ones.\nShe rested her hand lightly on his. Not steering. Supporting. “Leo, you are a\nhero to the people. We could easily persuade them to see you as a champion\nof the common man. You could commit to limits on the working day,\nprotections against exploitation, representation on governing bodies. We\ncould curb some of the most hated practices here in Angland as a\ndemonstration.”\n“I don’t know anything about labour laws!”\n“But I do.” She had helped develop half those hated practices, after all.\n“And we need only convince them that you do. Lord Isher, I hear the king’s\nforces have been spread out among the principal cities of Midderland to\ndeter any uprisings?”\n“That’s true.”\n“Action by the Breakers, carefully coordinated, might pin the King’s\nOwn down and prevent them from reacting to… other threats.”"

At least for now. I have long-standing business connections in\nStyria, too.”\nIsher looked less sure about that. “You really think you can bargain with\nthe Snake of Talins?”\n“No. But I understand King Jappo is keen to step from his mother’s\nshadow… I might be able to arrange a meeting with him directly.”\nLeo was more dismayed by every word. “Jappo’s a notorious bloody\ndegenerate!”\n“Let us overlook his taste in lovers and focus on his soldiers and his\nmoney. His help could tip the balance well into our favour. It could save\nlives. It could save our lives.”\n“The idea makes me feel dirty.” Leo squirmed in his seat. “What would\nit cost us?”\nSavine would have liked to slap him but she settled for calm argument.\n“The root of the dispute between Styria and the Union is King Orso’s claim\non the dukedom of Talins. We could promise to give it up. We could stop\nsupporting Sipani’s independence.” She paused a moment, considering\nwhether to take the next step. But once you decide to rebel against the\nCrown, there really are no lines left to cross. “We could offer them\nWestport.”\nCurnsbick would have been pleased. He was forever urging her to be\nmore charitable, and here she was giving whole cities away. “Surrender\nWestport?” Leo gasped in outrage. But Savine noted that Lord Isher stayed\nsilent.\n“A paltry price to pay in return for Midderland, Angland and\nStarikland,” she said. “Have you ever even been there?”\n“Well, no, but—”\n“A dusty slum clogged with superstitious fools. I for one will not miss\nit.”\n“We fought three wars against the Styrians. Nasty ones. I mean…” Leo\nlooked to Isher for support, but Isher was too busy looking at Savine, his\npatronising smile long gone. “It’s not very patriotic.”\n“If looking unpatriotic worries you, then consider how being hanged for\ntreason looks.” Savine put some iron into her voice. “This is not a game. We\nmust be utterly committed. Fail and we are doomed.”\nThere was a long, uncomfortable silence. A log shifted in the sooty old\nfireplace and sent a shower of sparks up the chimney. “Her Grace is right,”\nsaid Isher. “We are risking everything. We must play every card.”\n“But we have to be above reproach!” Leo glanced up at the paintings of\nprevious Lord Governors as if at a disapproving jury. “Pure and principled.\nIf we’re willing to do anything, then how are we any better than them?” He\nhad the wounded whine of a boy who finds the grown-ups have stolen his\ngame and are playing it in a way he by no means approves of. “We have to\ndo the right thing!”"

That there could be no right side, only their side. But why\nbreak down a door when you could just slip through a window? “Leo—\nah!” And she hunched over, clutching her belly.\nLeo sprang to his feet. “By the dead, are you—”\n“It’s nothing.” She grabbed his hand, bared her teeth. “Ah! But could\nyou fetch Zuri, get her to bring that tonic—”\n“Of course!” And he rushed from the room as fast as his limp would\nallow.\nIsher had half-risen, too. “Lady Savine, can I—”\n“Who do you imagine will be king when this is over?” Savine arranged\nherself again in her chair and coolly met his eye.\nHe gave a disbelieving little laugh and slowly sat himself. “King Orso,\nof course. We plan to remove a corrupt Closed Council. To depose the king\nwould be treason.”\n“So you plan to stop at half-treason? Come, come. Meat half-cooked\nagrees with no one. Humiliate the king but leave him on the throne and you\nwill be storing up your own destruction. Not to mention mine.” She had\nlearned a hard lesson in Valbeck. She would never allow herself to be weak,\nor vulnerable, or terrified again. It gave her a surprisingly sharp pang, but\nher merciless logic could only lead her to one place. Perhaps she had loved\nOrso once, but he hated her now. Her father had lied to her all her life. And\nloyalty? A trick those with power played on those without to make them act\nagainst their own interests.\nShe met Isher’s eye. “King Orso has to go.”\nHe ran his tongue about the inside of his mouth, moving now from\nadmiration to suspicion. “I see that we are speaking plainly—”\n“When speaking of treason, anything else would be ridiculous. What do\nyou really have without us? Lord Barezin, I understand, laughs himself to\nthe point of incontinence staging pornographic plays about Queen Terez in\nhis private theatre. Lord Heugen, I hear, insists on steeping in a copper bath\nevery morning to replenish his magnetic energies. Should we discuss the\nshortcomings of Lady Wetterlant?”\n“You are well informed.”\n“Knowledge is the root of power, Juvens said.”\n“And what have you found out about me?”\nSavine’s turn to pause. “On you, I must confess, my book has a blank\npage.”\n“I am a careful man, Your Grace. And that unfortunate business with\nWetterlant has given me great authority in the Open Council. A unity they\nhave never had before. I will keep the lords in line, I promise you that.”\n“Even so. In the army of Angland, we supply the best and most\nexperienced soldiers you could hope for. In Stour Nightfall, we bring a\ndecisive ally. Would you agree?”\n“You leave me little choice but to agree.”\nShe laughed as though he had made an excellent joke. “My aim in every"

        "text": "decisive ally. Would you agree?”\n“You leave me little choice but to agree.”\nShe laughed as though he had made an excellent joke. “My aim in every\nconversation. My husband has fewer enemies and far more popular support\nthan any other candidate. And he has some vestige of a legitimate claim\nthrough his grandfather. A better claim than the current occupant of the\nthrone, some might say. He will be king, Lord Isher.” And she would be\nqueen, and the ashes of that most treasured ambition blazed up suddenly\nagain. “If you want us to gamble everything, that is my price.”\n“And when the mighty Brocks take the crown, what will remain for the\nrest of us?”\n“Everything else. I think you would make an excellent Arch Lector and\nFirst Lord of the Open Council, Your Eminence.” Isher was good at hiding\nhis feelings, but she caught his flicker of satisfaction at the title. “Which\nwould leave your magnetic and pornographic colleagues to decide who will\nbe lord chamberlain and lord chancellor. I imagine Leo would like to\nchoose his own lord marshals, but you could fill the other seats with\nfriends.”\n“And does all this come from your husband or from you?”\n“What comes from me comes from him.”\n“And yet you send him upstairs while we discuss it.”\n“So that when the crown falls in his lap, he can honestly say he never\nsought it, but accepts it reluctantly for the benefit of all. You know he has\nno taste for deceit.”\n“Not a problem his wife shares,” observed Isher.\n“Nor his very particular friend. I daresay you would agree with me that\nthe strongest horses often need blinkers. They are best led one step at a\ntime.”\nLord Isher narrowed his eyes at his glass, swirled the spirit around in it,\nthen looked up at her. She had taken him on quite a journey that evening.\nFrom scornful, to thoughtful, to impressed, through admiration, suspicion\nand, finally, to acceptance. An acquaintance, romance and estrangement all\nin one sitting. “Your terms are acceptable.”\n“Good.” Savine felt satisfied with the outcome. For now, at least. “I look\nforward to working with you.”\nThe door burst open and Leo hurried over. Zuri was behind him, but\nafter a glance at the way Savine and Isher were sitting, she hung back.\n“Are you all right?” Leo lurched down on one knee beside her.\n“No need to worry.” She took his hand, and pressed it to her belly, and\nsmiled. “Lord Isher has made me feel so much better.”\nA Private Language\n“I\nhad a quick word,” said Broad.\nIt seemed, without ever agreeing it, that him and Savine had worked out\na kind of private language, where the words didn’t mean what they\nnormally meant. What Broad meant by “having a quick word” was that he’d\nknocked half the teeth out of the mouthiest worker they could find, as an\nexample to the others. “Everyone’s back to work, night shifts, too. Don’t\nreckon you’ll have any more problems at the armoury.”\n“Master Broad,” said Savine, “you are an absolute magus when it comes\nto labour relations.”\nBroad absently rubbed his sore hands together.

He wondered who it helped, giving ugly things\npretty names. Didn’t really make it any prettier. The opposite, if anything.\n“Might we talk for a moment?” she asked, like they were two old friends\nwho never got the chance to catch up. She had that glow about her, now,\nthat women can get when they’re expecting. Broad remembered that glow\non Liddy, when she was pregnant with May. Long time ago, when he had\nall his hopes intact.\n“Of course, Lady Savine. I mean, Your Grace. Sorry.”\n“Don’t be ridiculous, Gunnar, you never have to apologise to me. I know\nhow much I owe you. No less than my life. Had I not happened upon you in\nValbeck…” Her smile slipped for just a moment, then she took a breath and\nwhipped out a new one, wider than ever. “And you have been an absolute\ntreasure since. I hardly know how I used to manage without you. You, and\nLiddy, and May. Your daughter is a wonder with the books. Such a credit to\nyou.”\n“Thank you, Your Grace.”\n“I hope you are happy working for me. You and them.”\n“We are, Your Grace.” They were, anyway, and that was what counted.\n“Couldn’t be happier.”\n“It feels almost as if—and I hope you will not think me presumptuous—\nbut it feels as if I am a part of your family, and you a part of mine. I would\nhate for us to be… split up.” She had that glow, no doubt. A healthy\nsoftness to her face, and a lively colour to her cheeks, and her hands\ncupping the slight swell of her belly. But that flinty gleam in her eye was\nthe same as ever. Broad gave threats for a living. He knew how to spot one.\nHe cleared his throat and looked down at his boots. Fine new pair of boots\nhe had, all shiny.\n“There is… one small favour I need you to do for me,” she said.\n“Something very important. It needs someone strong. Someone brave. But\nalso someone subtle. There is no one else I trust to do it.”\nBroad swallowed. “Anything I can do, you know that.”\n“You were with the Breakers in Valbeck. You were one of them.”\n“I… was,” he said, frowning. He didn’t know where she was taking him\nbut didn’t much like the direction of travel. “Thought I was doing right. I\nguess.” Hard to remember what he’d thought. Seemed like a different man\nwho’d thought it.\n“Of course you did. Is there any possibility, do you think…” And she\nlooked up at him from under her eyelashes. “That you could get in touch\nwith them again?”\n“The Breakers?”\n“Yes. The Burners, too, even?”\nShe said it as though it wasn’t much to ask for. Not much effort, and\ncertainly no risk. There was that language again, where they both said one\nthing but meant another. They both knew it’d be a lot of effort. They both\nknew it’d be a hell of a risk.\n“Maybe.” Broad pushed his lenses gently up his nose. Most of the"

Most of the\nBreakers he’d known in Valbeck had been left hanging from gibbets after\nthe uprising, and the rest would be nursing deep grudges. Most of the\nBurners had been halfway mad to begin with. What he’d been doing for a\nliving would not be at all popular in those quarters. Calling it labour\nrelations wouldn’t fool anyone who’d lived in a cellar. “Maybe there’s still\nsome folk in Valbeck who could put me on the right track…”\n“All I ask is that you try.”\n“My best, like always.” Meaning his worst, like always. It was his turn\nto look her in the eye. “Just promise me you’ll look after Liddy and May,\nwhile I’m gone.” And he offered her his hand.\nHer grip was surprisingly strong. Brought a twinge to his aching\nknuckles. “As if they were my family.”\n“You’re not even staying for dinner?” asked Liddy. She looked worried.\nThey both did.\n“Got to leave tonight,” said Broad, tossing a few things in a bag. “It’s\nurgent.”\n“Where are you going?”\n“Midderland.” He was getting a lot better at lying than he used to be.\nYou have to come at it sideways. Just enough truth to answer the question.\nNot enough to actually tell ’em anything. If he’d said Valbeck, they’d\nprobably have set to crying. Maybe he would’ve himself.\nMay watched him from the doorway, one hand fiddling with the silver\nnecklace she wore these days. “It’s nothing dangerous, is it?”\n“Working for a fine lady, like you always say. How dangerous could it\nbe?” And he smiled at May, and she smiled back. Either he was getting a lot\nbetter at lying, or they just wanted to believe him. He hid it with a joke.\n“And don’t spend too much time with Zuri’s brother Rabik, I’ve seen how\nthe two o’ you grin at each other.”\n“Shut up, Da!” Giving him a shove and blushing at the same time.\nHe held them both close near the doorway. When he’d gone away to\nStyria, he’d barely even said goodbye. So keen to leave. Now he clung on\ntight. Too tight, maybe.\nLiddy looked up at him as they broke apart. “You won’t be long, will\nyou, Gunnar?”\n“No, I won’t be long.” And he threw the bag over his shoulder. He’d\nalways thought of himself as honest to a fault. Blunt as a hammer, ask\nanyone. But it occurred to him then he’d started speaking that private\nlanguage with everyone. Saying one thing and meaning another. Only\nLiddy and May weren’t in on it. “Be back before you know it,” he said, and\nshut the door.\nBut he wondered if he would be. He wondered if he’d ever be back.\nOld Friends\n“Y\nou know you’re more beautiful than ever.”\nSavine looked sideways at him, one long-lashed eye showing under the\nbrim of her hat, rocking gently with the movement of her horse. “Are you\nflattering me, Your Grace?”"

She rode well. What didn’t she do\nwell? Perched elegantly side-saddle with her whip-hand resting on the\nslight swell of her belly, steering her horse with the same effortless\nconfidence she steered everything else. But he still worried. “Sure you don’t\nwant to go in the carriage, though?”\n“In the jungles of Yashtavit, women hunt while eight months pregnant.\nUp in the North, they work in the fields until they give birth. Honestly, it’s\nmuch the same these days for the factory girls in Adua. A little ride will do\nno harm.”\n“I reckon if a factory girl, a Northern peasant or a dusky huntress was\noffered a break in a carriage, they’d likely take it.”\n“By all means, you can sit in it, then.” And she tapped her horse’s flank\nwith her crop and moved ahead.\nPerhaps there’d been a part of him that had hoped the rebellion would\nnever happen. That it would come to nothing more than after-dinner bluster\nwith the fellows from the Open Council. A part that had looked forward to\nSavine finding out, so she could give an indulgent sigh, and pat the back of\nhis hand, and put a sensible stop to the whole business.\nBut to his amazement, she’d pounced on the scheme with the total lack\nof doubt she brought to everything and applied all her formidable powers to\nmaking it not only a reality, but a success.\nHe felt hugely excited, of course. They were on a grand adventure, of\ncourse. And doing the right thing, of course. It was just that he also,\nsometimes, in quiet moments, felt strangely horrified. But there was no way\nback now. He’d look an utter fool. And once Savine got her teeth into a\nthing, it was happening, and that was all there was to it.\nHe caught her up, leaving their guards and servants behind. “By the\ndead, I’m glad you came.”\n“I’ve always wanted to see the North.”\n“So you’ve come for the sights? Not to make sure I don’t do something\nreckless?”\n“I can do two things at once.” That one eye slipped across to him, and\nshe nudged her mount closer to speak softly. “This is important. We need\nallies.”\n“I know how Northmen think,” said Leo. “I grew up with them.”\n“Of course. These are your friends. I am only here to help. Haven’t I\nbeen a help to you in Ostenhorm?”\n“You’ve been a bloody marvel in Ostenhorm.” In fact, she’d proved so\ngood at running the governing meetings that he’d stopped attending\naltogether. He was still lord and master and had the last word, as she was\nalways telling him. But why use it when her words sounded so damn good?\n“I do worry about my mother, though—”\n“There’s no need.”\n“She’ll see Jurand drilling the men, raising more, she’s no fool—”\n“Clever people are prone to believe what they want to, Leo, just like\neveryone else.

You are\nraising more soldiers because Northmen only respect force. Our talks with\nStour will go that much better if he knows we are well armed. She was full\nof praise for your strategy.”\n“Oh,” said Leo again. That was a first.\n“And then I begged for her help and loaded her down with enough work\non the new tax system to keep five clever people busy. What your mother\nwants second most in the world is to feel useful.”\nLeo felt that witless smile on his face. The one he usually ended up with\nwhen he came to Savine with a problem, then found she’d solved it weeks\nago. With her on his side, how could he fail? “What the hell would I do\nwithout you?” he murmured.\n“Luckily for you…” And she touched him firmly on the thigh with her\nriding crop and caused a pleasurable stirring in his trousers. “It is not a\nproblem you will ever have to face.”\nAnd they rode from the trees into the open.\nHe gave a delighted laugh to see the gates of Uffrith, dappled sunlight\nshifting on its lichen-spattered walls. He remembered how it had felt the\nfirst time he came here, as a boy—the excitement, the romance, the freedom\n—to be in the North, the land of heroes!\nHe spurred on, through a cluster of new huts and houses, leaving Antaup\nand Jin and the rest behind with the carriage and the wagons. Savine kept\npace with him, through the gates and clattering down the cobbled way\nbeyond, the dirty-faced people in their colourless clothes gazing up in\nwonder as they passed. A lot had changed. New buildings where Stour\nNightfall burned the old ones, maybe. Grander buildings, stone and slate\nrather than wood and wattle.\n“Good old Uffrith!” He took a long breath of that familiar air. Sheep,\ndung, woodsmoke and sea salt, but sweet with happy memories for him. “I\nspent the best years of my childhood here. I know every alley of the place!”\n“That wouldn’t be too difficult.” Savine gave a scornful little laugh. “I\nthought you said this was one of the North’s greatest cities?”\n“It is.”\nHe had to admit, seeing it fresh through her eyes, used to the scale of\nAdua and the pomp of the Agriont, it looked a mean, poor, primitive place.\nFor some reason, that nettled him. “Things might not be so grand here as in\nMidderland, but they’re honest,” he snapped. “They’re good people. They\nhave a code and they stick to it. They’re great fighters. Brought up with\nswords in their hands. Rikke will be a staunch ally. She’s one of the\nwarmest, truest, most straightforward people I know!”\nSavine looked calmly away from him. “Perhaps you should have\nmarried her.”\nThey rode on in silence.\nLeo knew the pattern of the crooked rafters in the Dogman’s hall by heart."

The firepit still glowed, ripples of red and orange rustling through\nthe embers, the heat pressing on Leo’s face as he came close.\nBut there’d been changes. The hall had always bustled with life in the\nDogman’s day. Now there was a brittle silence which made Leo feel guilty\nover his every footstep. At this time, in this season, the shutters should’ve\nbeen wide open and the sea breeze washing in. Now hides were hung in the\nwindows, painted with circles of runes, sinking the hall into gloom. There\nwas a new smell, sweet and strange and sharp, like burned cakes. There\nwere skulls on the wall in a shadowy herd. Horned and antlered skulls of\nram and bull and stag and great animals he didn’t know. Animals of the\nutmost North, maybe, where the sun doesn’t shine and the world blurs into\nmyth.\n“Leo! Savine! I’ve missed you.” And Rikke swaggered from the\nshadows, arms spread wide, dangling with bracelets and thongs and charms,\ninto the shaft of light from the smoke-hole.\nLeo almost shrank back in shock. There was a great dark stain across her\nface. A tattoo, black runes, black lines, black arrows in a crescent from her\ncheek, covering one side of her forehead, to the bridge of her nose. Her\nright eye was turned white with just a milky pinprick in the centre, while\nthe hungry pupil of the left had swallowed the whole iris, yawning like a\ngrave-pit.\n“Ah.” She waved a hand in front of her face. It used to be round, soft.\nNow it was all sharp ridges and shadowy hollows. “All this? I forget.” She\ntapped at her skull with one long finger, the hair on the left all clipped back\nshort while on the right it was grown to wild tufts and tangles. “Can’t see it\nfrom in here, but I’ve heard it said the tattoos and the eyes and all can be…\noff-putting.”\n“Not at all,” croaked Leo. “Just… unexpected.”\nThe gold ring through her nose shifted as she smiled. He didn’t know the\nwords for that smile, but warm, true and straightforward weren’t the ones.\n“You remember I used to have fits? Leo remembers, I reckon.” And she\nwinked at him. She’d had one the first time they’d lain together, after all,\nboth stark naked in a hay pile. “This is the cure.”\n“The cure?”\nRikke stuck her fingertip in her milky right eye. “This eye fought the\nother, so it had to go.

Best thing about you, I reckon!\nYou kept the runes, I see.”\n“They feel like good luck.” Savine touched the little wooden tablets she\nwore around her neck. “And you kept the emeralds.”\n“They feel like high value,” said Rikke, pulling them up with her\ncrooked little finger so they cut white into her long, lean throat.\n“I have another gift for you,” and Savine waved Zuri from the shadows,\na length of cloth over her arm, a vivid red that seemed almost to shine in the\nmuddy grey hall, golden stitching gleaming in the hem. “This is Zuri, my\ncompanion.”\n“Is it?” Rikke narrowed her eyes, then slid them, sly as a cat, towards\nSavine. “Sure you aren’t hers?”\n“I have heard it said God puts us all where we are meant to be,” said\nZuri.\n“Wouldn’t know,” said Rikke. “We don’t see much of Him up here.” She\ntook the cloth and shook it out with a snap, holding it up to the light.\n“Oooooooh, you give the best presents!”\n“Suljuk silk,” said Savine, “from beyond the Thousand Isles. I thought\nperhaps you could make a dress from it, or a hanging, or…”\nRikke was already wrapping it around herself, ending up with something\nbetween a scarf, a cloak and a hood.\nZuri cocked her head on one side. “That works.”\n“I love it.” Rikke smiled as she rubbed her cheek against the shining\nfabric. “And I see you’ve got a gift for Leo, too.” She dropped down on her\nknees, staring at Savine’s belly. “Can I feel?”\n“Well, I suppose—”\nRikke slid her arms around Savine and pressed her tattooed cheek into\nher stomach, making her gasp.\nSavine stared at Leo, but all he could do was shrug.\n“Oh,” crooned Rikke, eyes closed as she snuggled in tight. “I’d expect\nsomething special from the two of you but this… this will change the\nworld.”\n“Where’s your friend Isern-i-Phail?” asked Leo. “And Caul Shivers? I\nswear you’re the only person in the world he likes.”\n“I sent ’em off to make new friends. The Protectorate’s small. We need\nevery friend we can get.”"

We need\nevery friend we can get.”\n“You should’ve come to us.”\n“I knew you’d be coming to me.”\nLeo tried to smile, but it wasn’t easy. Every time he saw a hint of that\ngangly girl he’d played hide and seek with in this very hall, she’d flash that\nsly smile, and turn that strange left eye on him, and he’d feel as if she was\nlooking right into him. Right through him. The woman he’d known was\nvanished, sure as her father, and he was shocked at how much he missed\nthem.\nSavine, meanwhile, gnawed at her meat, lips and fingers shiny with\ngrease, a pile of stripped bones on the table in front of her. “She might look\nlike a doll,” murmured Rikke in Northern, “but she eats like a warrior.”\nLeo laughed. “Something I should know about?” asked Savine.\n“She… wonders if you want a fork.”\n“When I was in Valbeck I ate with my fingers.” Savine ripped some\ngristle from her meat with her teeth and spat it into the firepit as neatly as\nany Named Man. “When I ate at all. I came to the North to see how things\nare done here. Not to do things my way regardless.”\n“Very open-minded,” said Rikke. “But you didn’t come here to improve\nyour table manners. The two o’ you are after something or my name’s not\nSticky Rikke.”\nSavine’s raised brow told Leo it was time to get to business. “You’re\nright. I wanted to see Uffrith, and I wanted to see you, but you’re right. I\nneed your help, Rikke.”\n“Naught my father wouldn’t have done for an old friend. And we go way\nback, eh? Used to wrestle on this very floor, didn’t we? What do you need?”\n“Your father’s warriors. Your warriors, I mean.”\n“Who are we fighting?”\n“I hope they won’t have to fight.”\n“But we both know hopes can turn out barren. You wouldn’t be asking\nfor warriors if you didn’t have a fight in mind.”\nLeo glanced towards Savine one last time, almost hoping she might give\nthe faintest shake of her head, and they could forget the whole business. But\nshe narrowed her eyes and gave the faintest nod instead.\n“We’re fighting the Closed Council,” said Leo.\nRikke slowly eased back on her father’s bench, puffing out her hollow\ncheeks. “I know you like a scrap, Leo, but did you think of picking a\nsmaller one?”\n“Few of us get to pick our battles,” said Savine. “The battles pick us.”\n“Maybe you should let this one pick someone else.”\n“You saw what they were like in the war!” Leo sat forward angrily.\n“Promising everything. Giving nothing. The Union abandoned Uffrith.\nAbandoned your father. Abandoned you! But Angland never did. I never\ndid.” He realised as he said it, sitting beside his new wife, that Rikke might\nsee it differently, and he cleared his throat, and frowned down at the table."

She could always see right through him.\nAnd honesty can be a kind of weapon, too. “Carleon,” he said. “As you’ve\nno doubt guessed.”\n“To beg for the Great Wolf’s help.” Rikke bared her teeth and snarled at\nhim with sudden, shocking fury. “The man who burned half this city on a\nwhim? Who promised to send my guts to my father in a box? Who killed\nmy friends and yours? Who’d have killed you, if my Long Eye hadn’t seen\nit coming? Break what they love, he said. You’d have me link arms with my\nworst enemy?”\n“Sometimes we must use one enemy to fight another,” said Savine.\nRikke curled back her lip and sucked a shred of meat from between her\nteeth. “Oh, you’re a clever one, Lady Brock. You could crawl through a\nkeyhole, I reckon, even with a swollen belly. But last time we met it was on\nyour ground. Up here, enemies aren’t so easily spun into friends.”\n“Oh, I doubt the rules are so very different,” said Savine. “Uffrith needs\nprotection. That is why it became a Protectorate. King Orso and his Closed\nCouncil have shown they will not help. Side with us, we can keep the\nbalance between you and Nightfall. Turn us down, your time is already\nrunning out. It really is as simple as that.”\n“So I risk everything, and in return I get what I’ve already got?” Rikke\nsnorted. “And a scrap of red cloth, of course. You like making deals. If you\nwere sat on my bench, what would you say to that one?”\n“I would say it’s the best you’ll get,” said Savine. Leo winced. He’d\ncome to ask for help from an old friend, but now his wife was turning the\nwhole thing into a hard-headed bargain. One with more than a whiff of\nblackmail about it.\nHe held up his hands before things got any worse. “We’re friends! I\nrisked my life for you. For Uffrith.” He grimaced as he shifted his leg. “I’ve\ngot the scars. But I’d do the same again. I helped you against your enemies.\nI’m asking you to help me against mine.”\nSavine sat back, sour, wiping her fingers on a cloth. Rikke sat back,\nsulky, hands on the bench behind her and her bony shoulders up around her\nears. “You’re asking a lot, Leo. Of me and of my men. Don’t pretend you’re\nnot. I need to think on it. Maybe the Long Eye’ll open in the night. Show\nme the answer.”\n“I understand. It’s a big decision.” The uncomfortable silence stretched,\nand Leo looked down awkwardly at the floor.

The kind men of the\nNorth had been fighting in since before words were written. “What’s the\nCircle for?”\nRikke’s face slid into shadow, the gleam of one eye in the darkness.\n“Folk who don’t agree with me.”\nNew Friends\nR\nikke woke with a lurch, flinging off the furs like they were throttling her,\nthoughts chasing each other around her sweaty head. Took her a moment to\nremember where she was. Who she was.\nShe still wasn’t used to sleeping in her father’s bed. But it was likely the\nbest bed in the North. Huge, even though he’d been small. Always said he\nwanted to keep rolling and never fall out. He’d had the frame carved by the\nbest shipbuilder in Uffrith, monsters prowling over the wood, and bought\nthe goose-feather mattress for its weight in silver off some Styrian\nmerchant. Other than Rikke, it was probably the thing he was proudest of in\nthe world. Broke his heart to leave it when Black Calder took the city, filled\nhim with joy to find it in one piece when he came back. Always said he’d\nspent half his life sleeping on the dirt, so he’d sleep the other half in\ncomfort’s pillowy embrace and make no apologies.\nShe still wasn’t used to sleeping in her father’s bed, but it made her feel\nclose to him, even though he was gone. And when you’re left the best bed\nin the North, what should you do, sleep on the floor?\nShe swung her feet down and wriggled her bare toes into the cold\nboards, nodding to herself as all the pieces dropped into place in her mind.\nMight be she’d had a vision, might be she’d had a dream, might be she’d\njust had an idea, but whether you put it down to magic, luck or wits, she\nsaw now what had to be done. Someone had to pick the course, after all.\nWouldn’t be pleasant. Wouldn’t be easy.\n“But easy is for the dead,” she whispered, and stood.\nThat morning had a feel of summer, chilly but bright, curved streaks of\ncloud high up against the blue like dragon’s ribs. Rikke shifted her chagga\npellet from one side of her mouth to the other and drew that bright red cloth\nabout her shoulders. It was quite a thing for some woven thread, so\nbeautiful it made her feel beautiful, which was a rare feat these days. And\nwho should be sitting on the bench in her father’s unkempt garden,\nwatching the sunrise sparkle on the sea, but the one who gave it to her?\n“Savine dan Brock herself!” said Rikke. “You’re up early.”\nShe seemed a different woman without all the powder and paint and\ncostume. Younger and softer. More ordinary and more honest. Like a\nwarrior without his mail, maybe. “No choice,” she said, laying her hands on\nher belly. “He, she or it seems intent on kicking me this morning.”\nRikke sat beside her. Watched the fishing boats rock on the waves while\nshe gathered the courage to ask. “Can I feel?”"

Watched the fishing boats rock on the waves while\nshe gathered the courage to ask. “Can I feel?”\nSavine considered her, eyes narrowed against the low sun, then she took\nRikke’s hand and guided it to her stomach.\nRikke frowned. Waited. Frowned. A little knobbly pressure shifted under\nSavine’s gown, then was gone. Just that, but Rikke found she was grinning\nlike she’d seen High Art. “It moved!”\n“That’s what it does.” Savine winced as she shifted on the bench. “That,\nand the moment I piss I need to piss again.”\n“Sorry I was a sour host last night,” said Rikke. That came out a little\nsour itself. Her pride had been hard fought for and she didn’t like\nswallowing it, even if her father had always said pride buys nothing. “In\nUffrith, we’re used to getting pushed from both sides. Being pushed brings\nout the worst in me.”\n“Sorry I was a sour guest,” said Savine. “I am used to fixing on what I\nwant then treading on whoever I must to get there. Where I come from, nice\nwins no prizes.”\nRikke slowly nodded. “Honestly, it’s much the same here.”\n“I should have told you how sorry I am about your father. Leo has\nspoken of him so often I almost feel I knew him. He was distraught… when\nthe news came.”\n“Aye.” And Rikke frowned towards her father’s grave, half-hidden by\nthe overgrown bushes. She was making even less progress on the gardening\nthan he had. “He’s always had a big heart, Leo.”\nSavine leaned close to murmur, “He could use his heart less, I\nsometimes think, and his head more.”\n“Why would he need his head when he’s got you? I mean, he might\ncome up with an idea you don’t like.”\n“Fair point.”\n“And your father? What’ll he feel about what you’re planning?”\n“My father.” Savine’s face turned stony. “You suppose he has feelings.\nHe always told me that to change the world you must first burn it down.”\n“He’d get on with my friend Isern, I reckon. She always says you must\nmake of your heart a stone.”\n“Sound advice. I very much admire what you have achieved here, you\nknow. It cannot be easy for a woman to take charge.”\n“Someone had to. The old men were making quite the fuck-up.”\n“Honestly, it is much the same in Angland.”\n“You should get a couple of the most troublesome ones to kill each\nother,” said Rikke. “You wouldn’t believe how thinning the pack brings the\nother old dogs into line.”\n“You haven’t killed each other, then?” Leo had stepped out into the sun,\na worried look on his face. There was no disguise in him at all. He couldn’t\nhave hidden a tree in a forest.\nHis wife was craftier. Far, far craftier. “We’re better friends than ever,”\nshe said, with a smile could’ve sweetened seawater.\nRikke did her best to match it, wondering whether Savine had friends, or"

Then she wondered if she was any better\nherself. Then she wondered whether it even mattered. Long as everyone\nmade sure they stayed useful, of course.\n“I had a vision in the night!” she said, throwing up her hands then\nslapping them down on her thighs. “I asked for a vision and I got one. Have\nto tell you that’s not usually how it works. It started off with me climbing a\nhill of bones.”\n“That… doesn’t sound great,” said Leo.\n“That was my thought! Dusty under the fingernails. But when I got to\nthe top, the sun rose over green uplands, and there was a lion, and it wore a\ncrown.”\nLeo frowned at Savine. “I don’t want the crown. A new Closed Council\nand an honest government and I’ll be satisfied.”\n“’Course,” said Rikke. “But it’s a promising sign. And when signs are\nsent, you’ve got to attend. What’s the point of the Long Eye if you’re not\ngoing to listen?” She thought about that. “Or look? Anyway, my point is…\nI’m with you. The men of Uffrith will be with you. Just make sure you put\nus on the other wing from the Great Wolf, eh? Wouldn’t want to kill that\nfucker at a bad time.”\nSavine’s smile held just a trace of suspicion. “You don’t… want\nanything?”\n“Just a share in your bright future.” Rikke watched a pair of little white\nbutterflies chase each other upwards in a spiral. “You two are going\nsomewhere. Not sure where, but I’m keen to find out. You helped us.”\nRikke pulled Leo down onto the bench beside her, one arm about his\nshoulders and one about Savine’s. “You risked your life for us. You saved\nus, Leo, and my father always paid his debts. I mean to pay mine.”\n“I knew you wouldn’t let me down.” Leo looked her right in the eye. The\none that couldn’t see, but still. “I can’t tell you what it means… to know\nI’ve still got your friendship.”\nThere was the Leo she knew. Part winning honesty, part naïve\nrecklessness. “Well, you know me.” She had to swallow the slightest lump\nin her throat. “I’m all about the friendship.”\nThey packed to leave soon after, which was quite the operation as\nSavine needed six big boxes with brass corners just to get out the door. The\ndead knew what she had in ’em. Secrets and lies, maybe.\nRikke gave her a hug, which was like hugging cut glass, then she gave\nLeo a hug, which felt very strange. She held him tight, and smelled that\nsmell he still had, and remembered how she used to feel, snuggling into the\nwarmth of blankets with his arms around her. Safe. She never felt safe any\nmore, and it came to her that if things had been a bit different, maybe she’d\nbe the one carrying his child.\nMost of her knew they’d never been well matched.

But she smells\ntoo good, d’you see? Not like a person. Like a cake. Like the best cake you\never tasted.”\n“We’re siding with her, not eating her. Unless you got some plans I don’t\nknow about.”\n“We’re siding with her husband. And if he is a lion, she is a golden\nserpent twisted all about him. If she told him down was up, he’d laugh at\nhis mistake and stand on his head.”\n“Probably. He’s never been the sharpest. And she’s cunning, and\nruthless, and ambitious as the plague.” Rikke shrugged and gave that sigh\nthat made her lips flap. “But stupid friends won’t take you far, will they?”\nIsern thought about that and opened her mouth. “Don’t say it!” snapped\nRikke, and she slowly closed it again. “Bring Hardbread on up here, tell\nhim we’ve got to gather the warriors. Every Named Man or Carl. Every\nThrall can hold a spear. And spears for ’em to hold, too.”\n“And shields?”\n“Aye, be nice if some of ’em came back.” Leo turned in his saddle to\nsmile and wave, and Rikke went up on tiptoe to smile and wave back.\nLooked like there were some men coming the other way. At least a dozen,\nsun glinting on their gear, and on the metal eye of the one in the lead.\n“Here’s Shivers.”\n“That or it’s some other metal-eyed bastard. Who’s that with him?”\nRikke shaded her good eye with her hand. He was very tall. Taller than\nShivers, even, but with a stoop, elbows stuck out and chin stuck forward,\nwhite-blond hair sprouting in tufts. “Unless I’m much mistook, I believe\nthat’s the Nail.”\n“I believe you’re right.”"

He looks angry as ever.”\n“Well, his da’s still killed,” said Isern, “so I’m guessing he will be.”\n“Good.” Rikke gave that fine red cloth a tweak about her shoulders and\nset off up the road to greet him. “An angry man is a useful man.”\nHe was taller than ever when you got close, not just his beard and his\nbrows pale but even his eyelashes. He’d a thoughtful look, but there was\nsomething in that easy slouch made Rikke think he might explode in\nviolence any moment. She’d seen it before, after all, when he was fighting\nwith the other side at the Battle of Red Hill. He’d seemed a terror then,\nblood-dotted face twisted with fury and laughter at once. But Rikke didn’t\nscare so easily these days.\nShivers jerked a thumb sideways. “This is—”\n“I know who this is.” Rikke took the Nail’s calloused hand. By the dead,\nit was a size, hers weren’t small but they looked like a child’s hands holding\nit. “No less a man than the Nail, famed champion of the West Valleys and\nson of the great Gregun Hollowhead.”\n“A sweeter introduction than I’d have dared give myself,” he said.\n“Oh, don’t be coy.” Rikke patted his scarred knuckles and let his hand\ndrop. “I saw you in the battle at Red Hill. You’re a bad enemy to have.”\n“Can’t think o’ higher praise. Saw you in the battle, too, and at the duel\nafter. Before all this, though.” And he waved towards the left side of his\nface, his pale eyes still on her, taking it all in.\n“Better to get looks for the wrong reason than draw no looks at all.” She\nturned the tattoos towards him. A little challenge. A habit she was getting,\nwhen folk stared. “And I haven’t shit myself once since it was done, which\nis a bonus.”\n“Saves on the laundry, I expect.”\n“I thought to myself, if you’re going to be hideous, why stop halfway?”\n“Why did you think that?” His pale brows drew in a little. “All I see are\npower and wisdom. Ask me, there’s naught more beautiful.”\nRikke blinked. She liked to think she was canny enough these days that\nflattery didn’t shift her far, but she had to admit that one found the mark.\nIsern leaned towards her, one hand shielding her mouth. “I’m thinking\nhe might be quite the find.”\n“I’m thinking the same,” muttered Rikke, tidying a bit of hair behind her\near that the salt breeze had whipped free. “What brings you down here,\nNail?”\n“Vengeance.”\nRikke held her hands up. “What have I done now?”\n“Ain’t you a jester?” said the Nail, giving a little snort. “Stour Nightfall\nkilled my father.

Like a spark might jump between them and\nsend her up in flames.\n“I heard tell you’d let it go,” she murmured.\n“That’s what I told Black Calder. I love to fight, but I hate to lose, and\nthe odds are long against me.”\n“So you haven’t let it go?”\n“I have not.”\n“And you’ve come to Uffrith looking for my help.”\n“I heard you’re a bad enemy to have. I know Stour fears you. Thought\nmaybe, with my sword and your eye, the odds would be shorter. Uffrith and\nthe West Valleys together. That’d be a thing no one could dismiss.”\nShe looked thoughtfully up at him. Quite a long way up, since she was\nstanding downhill. “My da told me vengeance was an empty chest you have\nto go bent under the weight of. He told me to let it go.”\n“Your da was a tough man and a crafty man and a man to be admired.”\n“No doubt,” said Shivers, quietly.\n“But you don’t agree?”\n“I do not,” said the Nail. “I’ll have Stour’s head or die trying. I saw you\nand him swap barbs before the duel. Thought you might feel the same.”\n“Oh, I feel just the same!” she snarled, showing him a glimpse of the\nfury she kept burning. “My father swore to see Black Calder dead, and I\nswore to see Stour Nightfall dead, and I mean to keep both of our words,\nhow’s that?” It brought a little smile from him. A little brightening of his\neye. “But I’ve folk to look after now.” She softened up, holding her hand\nout to Uffrith, looking quite pretty in the sunlight as it sloped down to the\nsea. “Can’t be sprinkling vengeance about willy-nilly. You see those Union\nguests of mine just leaving?”\n“The woman wrapped up like a feast-day gift? Aye, there was no\nmissing her.”\n“Well, that was the Lady Governor of Angland. I made a deal with her\nand her husband.” Rikke worked her mouth like there was a bad taste in it.\n“And it puts me on the same side as the King of the Northmen.”\nThe Nail shook his head. “Ah, that’s a shame.”\n“I tend somewhat to agree. No reason you and I can’t be good\nneighbours, though. Why don’t you come inside? I’ll toss a fresh log on the\nfirepit and crack a keg of my father’s ale.”\n“I’d sooner have vengeance.”\n“Were you going to run off to Carleon and grab it ’fore sundown?”\nasked Shivers.\n“My da used to say only the dead can’t spare time for a cup,” said\nRikke. “Let’s drink and talk about the future. What might happen. What\nI’ve seen will happen. Uffrith and the West Valleys together, after all.\nThat’d be a thing no one could dismiss.”"

It felt\ngood to be out of the city. The vapours seemed to get worse and the\ndemands of kingship more suffocating every day. Lord Hoff and his\nwearisome timetable, the pointless functions, the tedious rituals, every\nmoment scrupulously wasted far in advance with never an opportunity to\nactually do anything. Even Orso’s toilet habits were precisely\ncircumscribed, catalogued, overseen. He would not have been surprised to\nfind there were a bevy of highly lucrative offices for the purpose. Lord High\nWarden of the Royal Stool. Chief Custodian of His Majesty’s Passage. Piss-\nSmeller General.\nHe twisted the circlet gently from his head and held it up, looking\nthrough it towards the gleaming track. Towards the expectant crowd. He\ngave a little giggle.\n“Something amusing?” asked his mother, for whom nothing was ever\namusing.\n“I never realised before. The thing about crowns… there’s nothing in\nthem, is there?”\nOrso flinched at a sudden blast of steam from the machinery, a ripple of\n“oohs” and “aahs,” followed by polite applause. A band played something\nbrassy and optimistic. Smiling children waved little Union flags. The\nfamous device itself was a madman’s nightmare of cogs, rods and rivets, a\nbeast of brass and iron gleaming with grease, vapour puffing from its valves\nlike smoke from a dragon’s nostrils. It was mounted on a pair of polished\nrails that stretched across two fields to a bridge fluttering with coloured\nbunting. On top of it, a noted actress wore a headdress and flimsy robe that\npresumably marked her out as inspiration or some such abstract virtue. The\nsun kept going in, though, and despite her beaming smile she looked mostly\nrather cold.\n“However does it work?” mused Orso, jamming his circlet back on. The\nengine might as well have been a sorcerer’s wand for all he understood its\nworkings.\n“I believe a coal-fired furnace heats water in the vessel to boiling,” said\nDietam dan Kort, his waistcoat straining dangerously about the buttons as\nhe leaned across Curnsbick’s empty chair. “The formation of steam within\ncreates pressure which drives a reciprocating piston converting expansive to\nrotational force, then transmitting it through a sequence of gears to the\nwheels. Would Your Majesty like more detail?”\nOrso raised his brows. “If anything… less.”\n“The fire makes steam,” pronounced Queen Terez, deigning to speak a\nfew words in the common tongue but insisting on doing so with an\noverpowering Styrian accent. “The steam makes it go.”\n“That,” admitted Kort, “is the essence.”\nHonrig Curnsbick, the great machinist himself, stood near his creation"

One of\nthem shovelled coal furiously into the glowing maw of the machine.\nAnother weighed a giant wrench while frowning towards the royal box with\nan intensity bordering on hatred. Sadly, there was nothing remarkable in\nthat. Orso regarded anything warmer than strong dislike from one of his\nsubjects as a delightful surprise.\n“You really should have a queen beside you,” observed his mother.\nHe grinned sideways at her. “I do.”\n“I mean a wife, as you well know. Help me, High Justice.”\n“Her Majesty. As always. Makes a fine point.” Bruckel leaned past\nOrso’s mother to jab out a few phrases. “See what marriage has done. For\nthe Lord Governor of Angland.” Orso winced. He would rather have been\nsquirted with poison than with more news of Leo dan Brock’s happy union.\n“The government there was paralysed. Antiquated. Incompetent. Since his\nwedding? Turned. Around.”\n“Lady Savine is an immensely talented woman, though!” Kort leaned in\nfrom the other side to unwittingly make matters even worse. “I must\nconfess, I was reluctant to embrace her as a partner but, well, I couldn’t\nhave completed my canal without her. Stupendously talented.” Kort shook\nhis head, chin vanishing into the roll of fat beneath. “Not many like her\naround, Your Majesty.”\n“That settles it, then,” said Orso. “Lady Savine will simply have to\nmarry me and her husband.” The real tragedy was that he would likely have\nclutched at that arrangement with both hands.\nHis mother was less taken with it. “Don’t be facetious, Orso, it’s beneath\nyour majesty.”\n“I’m starting to think there’s nothing beneath my majesty.”\n“Your sisters both did their dynastic duty. Do you suppose Cathil wanted\nto move to Starikland?”\nHow often had they gone over this same conversation? “She’s an\ninspiration.”\n“Do you think Carlot wanted to marry the Chancellor of Sipani?”\n“She always seems rather pleased about it—”\n“You cannot delay any longer. You are not only damaging yourself, but\nthe whole Union.”\nShe detested the Union but believed hypocrisy was a thing that only\nhappened to other people. Orso gritted his teeth. “I’ll look at the latest list\nagain. But I want to organise this grand tour first. Get out into the country\nand introduce myself to the people!”\n“Far better to tour with a wife, then you could introduce her to the\npeople and get started on producing an heir at the same time.”\n“What? Actually simultaneously?”\nShe glanced at him down her nose. “At least they would see you were\nfinally taking your responsibilities seriously.”\n“Now who’s being facetious?”\n“My master would be delighted if you were to wed.”\nOrso recoiled at the voice in his ear.

Bayaz’s stooge, Yoru Sulfur, had\nleaned grinning forward from the chairs behind. He was one of those people\nwith an ugly habit of popping up at the worst moments.\n“Oh really?” snapped Orso. “Keen to buy a new dress, is he?”\nSulfur’s sharp smile showed no sign of slipping. “Anything that bears on\nthe stability of the realm is of interest to Lord Bayaz.”\n“How fortunate we are to have such a guardian. But what brings a\nmagus to a scientific demonstration? Haven’t you got…” Orso waved a\nhand. “Something magical to be about?”\n“There is not so wide a gulf between science and magic as some\nsuppose.” Sulfur nodded towards the city, where the House of the Maker\nwas still the tallest spike on the horizon. “Was not Kanedias himself the first\nand greatest of engineers? And did not Juvens say that knowledge is the\nroot of power? Lord Bayaz delights in nothing more than ideas,\ninnovations, new ways of thinking.” He turned his bright eyes towards\nCurnsbick’s steam-wreathed engine. “Imagine a network of these track-\nroads. Iron bands binding the Union ever more tightly together, carrying a\nnever-ceasing flood of goods and people. A wonder to rank alongside the\ngreat achievements of the Old Time!”\n“It sounds a marvellous project, Master Sulfur, but… an expensive one.”\nOrso began to turn away. “I fear my treasury is not up to the challenge.”\n“The Banking House of Valint and Balk has already offered to advance\nthe capital.”\nOrso frowned. It was largely due to the crippling interest on Valint and\nBalk’s loans that the treasury was in such a lamentable state. “That is…\nuncharacteristically generous of them.”\n“The bank would take the necessary land in trust and own the tracks,\ncharging a trifling stipend for their use. I was hoping you would consent to\nmy making the arrangements with the lord chancellor.”\n“That sounds rather like the first step in selling you my kingdom piece\nby piece.”\nSufur smiled wider yet. “Hardly the first step.”\n“Your Majesties!” Curnsbick hurried up to the royal box, whisking off\nhis hat and dabbing his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief. “I hope we\nhaven’t kept you waiting.”\n“Not at all,” said Orso. “Converting expansive force to rotational is… no\neasy business… I suppose—”\nThe Queen Dowager issued a thunderous snort of contempt, but\nCurnsbick was already facing the crowds, thumping his broad fists down on\nthe rail. The band sputtered out. The eager conversation died away. The\naudience turned from the engine to its creator. The great machinist began to\nspeak.\n“We have made astonishing progress in a few brief years, my friends!”\nDepending on who you asked, of course, Orso still heard plenty of\ncomplaints. “With the right techniques and machinery, one man can now do\nthe work that once took ten! Took twenty!” Though what became of the\nother nineteen was not made clear.\n“I firmly believe that this, my latest invention…” And Curnsbick wafted"

Took twenty!” Though what became of the\nother nineteen was not made clear.\n“I firmly believe that this, my latest invention…” And Curnsbick wafted\na hand towards the engine with the flourish of a pimp introducing his\nprostitutes. “Our latest invention, for it belongs to posterity, will not simply\ncarry a few of us from Adua to Valbeck in more comfort and less time than\never before. It will carry all of us… into the future!”\n“The one undeniable thing about the future,” murmured Orso’s mother\nin Styrian, “is that it comes to you, ready or not, without need for a\nconveyance.”\nIt certainly seemed a rather overcomplicated way of crossing two fields.\nBut Orso could only shrug and smile, which, after all, were his main\ncontributions to any of the many events he attended. If he’d had all the\nanswers then he supposed he could have been the great machinist, instead\nof merely a king.\n“There are those at both ends of the social scale who would have us\nchange direction!” Curnsbick was shouting. “Those who would not only try\nto dam the river of progress but have it flow uphill! Who would break, burn\nand murder in the name of dragging us back into a glorious past that never\ntruly was. A place of ignorance, superstition, squalor and fear. A place of\ndarkness! But there will be no going back! I promise you that!” He raised\nhis arm and turned to Orso. “Your Majesty, with your kind permission?”\nIt always worried Orso when someone wanted to involve him in a\ndecision, however superficially. But decisions still had to be made.\nHowever superficially. “Carry us into the future, Master Curnsbick!” he\ncalled, grinning to the crowd.\nCurnsbick turned to the engine and portentously chopped down his arm.\nThe engineer, his smile a curve of white in his oil-smeared face, hauled\nupon one of the levers, and the entire world exploded.\n“We have made astonishing progress in a few brief years, my friends!”\nbellowed Curnsbick.\n“Hear, hear!” Verunice piped, and was at once rather embarrassed. One\nwanted to stand out from the crowd, especially after so many years in the\nmost distant background, but one did not want to make an exhibition of\noneself. Only look at Savine dan Glokta, now Brock, of course. Everyone\ndid, after all. So audacious. Yet so feminine. The spirit of the new age!\nVerunice had joined all the forward-looking societies. The Fellowship for\nCivic Advancement, the Association for Improving the Condition of the\nWorking Classes, the Solar Society, of course. She had already made what\nshe considered an excellent investment with that young man Arinhorm. So\npolite. So attentive. He had looked at her in a way no young man had for\nyears. Verunice felt a flush and wished she had brought her fan. But though\nit was summer, it was not quite fanning weather.\n“With the right techniques and machinery,” Curnsbick was explaining,\n“one man can now do the work that once took ten!

Took twenty!”\nVerunice nodded eagerly, then realised she might nod her wig loose, put\na nervous hand to it and nearly knocked off her hat. She was not at all used\nto the headgear yet. Nor the dress. If she had been removed from it, the\ndamn thing would probably have stood up by itself, but the dressmaker had\ntold her this was what all the forward-looking ladies were wearing. She now\nfound herself scarcely able to breathe, turn or move her arms, but she had\nacquired, as if by magic, quite an impressive bust. Her mother had always\ninsisted that a bust was half the battle. Verunice had always wondered what\nthe rest of the battle might be but never had the nerve to ask.\n“I firmly believe that this, my latest invention…” And Curnsbick\ngestured towards his smouldering engine with the presence of a great actor\nupon the stage. Such a powerful man, those strong hands. Such a generous\nman, those impressive side whiskers. Such a visionary, piercing eyes behind\nhis flashing lenses. The spirit of the age! “Will carry all of us… into the\nfuture!”\nVerunice applauded as eagerly as her corsetry allowed. One could see\nthe future coming on the carriage ride out of Adua. The chimneys, the\ncranes, the endless building, endless creation, endless opportunity.\n“There will be no going back!” shouted Curnsbick. “I promise you\nthat!”\nVerunice applauded again, painfully this time but she didn’t care. There\nwould be no going back. Not to her smothering marriage or the suffocating\nhouse in the country or the stifling conversation at the village meetings. Her\nhusband was dead and she had the money now and she’d buy herself a\nfucking life. She blushed, then realised she hadn’t said the word, only\nthought it, so where was the crime? It was a new world. She could think\nwhat she liked. Could she even say what she liked?\n“Fuck,” she whispered, and felt herself blushing even more deeply. She\nwished she had brought her fan.\nThe young king smiled, so carefree, so debonair, such lovely glossy hair,\nhis golden circlet glittering in the sun. The spirit of the age! “Carry us into\nthe future, Master Curnsbick!”\nCurnsbick chopped one broad hand down and Verunice closed her eyes,\nfeeling the wind of freedom on her cheeks. Now she would be—\n“We have made astonishing progress in a few brief years, my friends!” It\nwas true the Union was much changed in the two decades since Muslan\narrived but mostly, in his opinion, for the worse. He felt the stares when he\nwalked the streets in his own neighbourhood. He felt the stares now. Less\ncuriosity than there once had been, and more fear. More dislike. Insults\nwere sometimes thrown. Objects, too, on occasion. A very pleasant young\nman of his acquaintance had been hit by a slate thrown from a roof and\nnearly killed. And he had been born in Adua! To Kadiri parents!

He would not hide from these\ndamn fool pinks, either.\n“With the right techniques and machinery,” Curnsbick blathered on,\n“one man can now do the work that once took ten! Took twenty!”\nMuslan gave a curt nod at that. There was much to detest about the\nUnion. They prated on freedom but the women who toiled in the fields and\nthe kitchens, the men who toiled in the mills and the mines, were as trapped\nin their lives of drudgery as any slave. A man was at least free to think here,\nthough. To have ideas. To change things.\nIn Ul-Suffayn the priests had declared him a heretic. His wife had\nbegged him to stop, but to Muslan his work was a holy duty. Others saw\ntheir holy duties differently. His workshop had been burned by people he\nhad once called friends and neighbours, the fires of belief in their eyes.\nThey say belief is righteous, but to Muslan only doubt was divine. From\ndoubt flows curiosity, and knowledge, and progress. From belief flows only\nignorance and decay.\n“I firmly believe that this, my latest invention…” And Curnsbick wafted\na hand towards the engine in the manner of a carpet-seller hoping to palm\noff substandard wares. “Will carry all of us… into the future!”\nWe all are carried into the future, always. What greets us when we\narrive, that is the pressing question. When the Prophet vanished, Muslan\nand those of his mind—the thinkers, philosophers, engineers—had hoped\nfor a new age of reason. Instead had come an age of madness. The priests\nhad said his work was against the laws of God. Ignorant cowards. Who\nmade the minds of men, if not God? What was the desire to create, if not a\nhumble imitation of His example? What was the grand idea, the great\nvision, the profound revelation, if not a glimpse of the divine?\n“There are those at both ends of the social scale who would have us\nchange direction!” Muslan had heard from those few friends in Ul-Saffayn\nwho still dared write to him that the Eaters had come. They had taken his\napprentices and his assistants and had burned his prototypes in the town\nsquare. He shuddered to think of it. The Eaters were belief distilled, belief\nwithout reason, mercy, compromise or regret. What could you call that, but\nevil?\n“But there will be no going back!” roared Curnsbick. “I promise you\nthat!”\n“No going back,” whispered Muslan, in his own tongue. He closed his\neyes, feeling tears prickling at the lids, and spoke the words to his wife, or\nat least to her ashes, wishing she could hear them. “I promise you that.”\n“Carry us into the future, Master Curnsbick!” brayed their dunce of a\nking.\nThe priests supposed scriptural and scientific truth were opposed\nbecause their tightly strapped little minds had only room for one or the\nother.

Overrun by brown bastards, not even with the decency to come with\ndrum and flag and sword so they could be properly fought and beaten, but\njust welcomed in at the back door by treacherous fucks wanting to sell their\ncountry for a few marks.\nThirty years ago, when this was all woods she’d come to for picnics\nwith her grandad, King Jezal had told the people to rise up for their country.\nMorilee had got her father’s old pike out of the shed, and put a new staff on\nit ’cause the old one was rotten, and she’d risen up, damn it, like the\nwomenfolk always did when they had to. She’d fought those Gurkish\nbastards in the fire-blasted ruins of the streets she’d grown up in. She\nrubbed at the stump of her arm. Thirty years on and it still ached. But\nmaybe the ache weren’t in her arm really, but in her heart. She frowned\nagain at that Gurkish bastard, standing proud with his little black beard like\nthis was his country. Had she fought for this? Lost her arm for this? Lost\nher fucking home for this?\n“There are those at both ends of the social scale who would have us\nchange direction!” Morilee knew how the ones at the bottom o’ the scale\nfelt, that was sure, with their houses knocked down to make way for the\nmills and their gardens built over to make way for the temples and their\nfamilies crowded into smaller and smaller rooms to make way for all the\nbastards flooding in from outside, the Gurkish and the Styrians and the\nNorthmen and who knew what, all babbling in their own dirty tongues and\nforcing down the wages and forcing up the rents and choking the air with\ntheir horrible cook-smells, filth you wouldn’t feed a dog, the gutters\nswarming with their mongrel brats.\n“A place of ignorance, superstition, squalor and fear. A place of\ndarkness!” She snorted. Curnsbick should come to the place she’d been\nliving the past year, she’d show him squalor and darkness. She turned her\nhead and spat. Tried to spit as far as that Gurkish bastard, but it fell short\nand spattered on some woman’s hat. Curnsbick raised his arm and turned to\nOrso. “Your Majesty, with your kind permission?”\nMorilee put the one hand she still had on her heart. Maybe this new king\nwas a clueless fucker but he was king still, and when she saw the golden\nsun flashing on the flags above, it still tickled the tears out.

All the hatred flung\nat her. Simply bounced off, like arrows off a gatehouse. But so lonely. Like\na single white tower on a blasted heath. Few truly realised how… difficult\nher position had been.

Even now, Terez felt the pain of tears at the\nthought of her face, her smile, her warmth, the way she sang, danced,\nkissed. Terez kept a bottle of her scent still. Among all the gaudy trash they\nheap upon a queen, the one thing that was truly precious to her. Just the\nfaintest whiff of that perfume brought it all tumbling back. That mad,\nromantic girl who would have fought the world for love was still trapped\nsomewhere in this stern old body. Terez felt the pain of tears, but she had\ntrained her eyes not to weep. She had sent her true love to safety. One must\ntake consolation in the small things, when one has nothing else. A nearly\nempty scent bottle, and a few sweet memories.\nShe took a deep breath, used it to force herself straighter. She lived now\nto hold up Orso’s hopes. To be his unflinching pillar. His dauntless shield\nagainst the barbs of the leering public. She had remade herself from stone\nand steel, an unbending, unsmiling, unfeeling sculpture of a woman, for his\nsake.\nShe could have played the game. She could have smiled, and lied, and\nstruck deals. But her father had taught her that compromise was weakness,\nand weakness, death. Only far too late had she begun to wonder whether her\nfather might not have been a giant, but a fool. Strange, how long a shadow\none’s parents cast. All she wanted now was to see Orso married to some\nfearsomely sensible woman. A woman with a strong enough grip to squeeze\nhim into the great man she knew he could be.

Like a man watching a tragic play that, to his surprise, had\nstruck some deep-buried nerve. As though he somehow guessed at the\nendless spring of sadness that welled inside her.

She did her best to hold his broken skull together\nbut pieces of it slid between her red fingers.\nShe tried to stand, but the over-bright world tipped crazily and slapped\nher in the side. Dust and splinters. Boots shuffled. She saw someone staring\nat her.

The railing of the royal box, its gaudy decorations now red-spotted.\nCurnsbick stood swaying beside her. His hat had been blown off and his\ngrey hair stuck out at all angles.\nTerez clutched at his bloody jacket. “What happened?” Couldn’t hear\nherself speak. Couldn’t hear anything. Curnsbick clasped his hands to his\nface. Stared between his fingers.\nTerez stuck her thumb in her ear and waggled it. It made nothing but a\nmuffled squelching. She squinted into the sunlight. Towards the engine. Or\ntowards where the engine had been.\nThere was nothing of it left now but a great claw of burning wreckage,\nsending up a thick plume of brown smoke. Papers fluttered down. Like the\nflower petals at her wedding, so long ago. Bodies were fanned out from the\nengine in rows. Mangled, tangled. Bodies still and bodies vaguely moving,\ntwisting, crawling. A man wandered drunkenly. His shirt appeared to have\nbeen torn off.\nThere were people coming through the bodies. Not helping. Stepping\nover the corpses. People in dark clothes, with dark masks over their faces.\nOne held a hatchet. One a long knife. One pointed towards the royal box\nwith a sword. Where was Orso? By the Fates, where was Orso?\nBeside her! He was beside her, staring, blood on his face. He had drawn\nhis sword. A king should never have to touch his sword, let alone draw it.\nShe tried to put herself between him and the assassins, but he brushed her\naway, pushed her back. He was so much stronger than she had expected."

He was so much stronger than she had expected.\nHad some part of her thought he was a snivelling toddler, still helpless in\nher arms?\nFaint through the burbling in her ears she heard him speak: “Get behind\nme, Mother.”\nSofee came blundering through the murk, gripping her sword so tight her\nhand ached, hardly able to breathe even with the cloth over her face, and\nstumbled to an uncertain stop.\nBodies everywhere. Bodies and parts of bodies. More and more revealed\nas the breeze snatched the smoke away. Things dropped. A walking stick. A\nhat. A broken picnic hamper, spilling broken crockery. A glove.\nNo. It was a hand.\nThe pamphlets they’d made fluttered down. The explanations, the\nexcuses, the justifications. One fell near Sofee’s boot, and began to soak up\nblood at one corner, and turn red. She’d been a governess for a year, before\nshe was married, so she’d been very particular about the wording of that\npamphlet. She’d wanted to convince people. To show them the truth.\nSomeone shoved her, near knocked her over. One of the other Burners,\ndesperate to begin the killing. Wasn’t that what she came for? All she’d\nwanted, for so long. To kill them. Tear them with her bare hands. Bite them\nwith her teeth. Now she wondered who “them” was. Whose enemy was the\nlittle boy with a fluttering pamphlet stuck across his face and his guts\nhanging out? She felt sick.\nBrevan had been the kind of man everyone liked the moment they met\nhim. The day they were married had been the happiest of her life. Suddenly\nspecial, when she’d been nothing since the day she was born. After they\nhanged him, left the crows picking at him above the road to Valbeck, it was\nlike the sun went out for her. Such a gloom she couldn’t even lift a finger.\nJudge had given her purpose. Lit a fire in the ashes. But now that\nhelplessness came flooding back.\n“Come on!” screeched Gus, dragging at her, and he half-pulled her over,\nleft her kneeling in the dirt as he charged on. Charged on with the rest of\nthem, all with a thirst for blood that would never be satisfied.\nJudge had promised her she’d feel better, after this. Cleansed by\nrighteous fire. But she saw now there was no feeling better, and for damn\nsure no cleansing. All she’d done was what was done to her.\nSofee had dropped her sword. She left it where it was. All those bodies.\nAll those injured. Even if she’d wanted to help them, where would you\nstart?\nBrevan had been such a good man. Everyone loved him the moment\nthey met him. Would he have wanted this?\nShe put a hand over her mouth.\nWhat had she done?\nCurnsbick’s terror, when he struggled up with his hat blown off, was not for\nhis own safety, but that he might be responsible.

        "text": "his own safety, but that he might be responsible. Or, at any rate, that he\nmight be blamed.\n“Oh, my,” he whispered. Carnage where the cheering onlookers had\nstood. Bodies strewn everywhere. It was as bad as that day in Crease.\nWorse, because then he had not been responsible. Could not possibly have\nbeen blamed.\nAmong engineers and investors there were many embittered failures,\nand he knew they must gaze enviously at him and think how wonderful it\nmust be, to be Curnsbick. They had no idea of the pressure. Ever since his\npatent portable forge, with every success the weight of expectation grew\nheavier. For every world-changing idea there were a million duds, and until\nthey were thoroughly tested and explored, the two could be surprisingly\nhard to tell apart. That was why he had founded the Solar Society, really. As\na great sounding board for his worse notions. That, and he simply could not\nsay no to Savine dan Glokta.\nSomeone clutched hold of him. Queen Terez? He wanted to blubber\nsome ridiculous apology, but his voice utterly failed him. All he could do\nwas put his hands over his face, stare between his fingers like a child at\nsome horror and murmur, “Oh, my.”\nSo when he saw the Burners coming, his first feeling was an improbable\nflood of relief. Someone to blame! The villains of the piece, custom made\nfor the purpose! Then came the sickening concern for his own safety. There\nwere a great number of black-clothed assassins down there. They had\ndispatched the disorganised guards, were converging on the royal box. They\nhad a Knight of the Body on his knees! Were smashing at him with\nhammers!\n“Oh, my.” Men can be brave in some ways, not in others. Curnsbick\ncould face the unknown and summon new things into being. Could stand\nbefore a crowd of hundreds and make them believe. Could take\nresponsibility for millions of marks and never falter. But when it came to\nphysical danger, he had always been a hopeless coward. He missed Majud\nterribly, then. Brave, stingy Majud. Missed him as he had every day these\npast ten years. But Curnsbick had made his choices. All that remained was\nto live with them. Or perhaps die with them.\n“If I may, Your Majesty?” That man Sulfur. He was brushing the king\naside. Went smiling towards a dozen well-armed fanatics as they mounted\nthe steps. What the hell was he about?\nA Knight of the Body came stumbling from the direction of the royal box.\nHe was stunned by the explosion, tangled with his purple cloak, and the\nBurners had come prepared. Judge had loved the notion of pouring Gurkish\nsugar through their visors and setting a match to it, but Gus had a more\npractical solution.\nBriar threw a net and pinned his sword-arm, then Rollow and Laws, two\nbeefy ex-diggers, went at him with hammers, aiming for knees and elbows.\nOnce they brought him down, Gus stepped up, swung his pick high and\nneatly punched it right through the top of his helmet. It was some time since\nhe had thought of himself as an engineer, but he could still take pleasure in\na well-executed design."

        "text": "neatly punched it right through the top of his helmet. It was some time since\nhe had thought of himself as an engineer, but he could still take pleasure in\na well-executed design.\nHe had been a wheelman once. A specialist in the design of\nwaterwheels, that was. A surveyor of slopes and flows. A connoisseur of\ndams and sluices. His scheme for the river-driven mill at Sharnlost had been\nmuch admired. But for the important work, one had to go to Adua. So he\nhad set out to study at the University, hoping to wear the robes of an\nAdeptus Mechanical himself one day, perhaps. What petty ambitions.\nGus charged through the scattering mass of panicked humanity, people\nrunning, begging, blubbing, bleeding, towards the royal box, waving his\ncomrades forward. “For the people!” he roared. “For the Great Change!”\nThe lecture theatres of the University’s grand new buildings had\ncontained only dry whispers and dated ideas. The inspiring speeches were\ngiven in the teahouses and jerry shops on the borders of the poor districts,\nwhere the intellectuals would spring onto the tables to hold forth on the\ninjustice of the current system, lay out bold fantasies for what could replace\nit, compete with each other to make the most outrageous pronouncements\non behalf of the noble and oppressed commoner. The commoners\nthemselves, it hardly needed to be said, could scarcely get a word in. Gus\nstill remembered the excitement of those heady days. It was the first time he\nhad ever believed in something greater than himself. Belonged to something\ngreater than himself.\nHis pick thudded into the back of a crawling city watchman, and as he\ndragged the bloody weapon free, he knew he had never done such important\nwork.\nIt was not until he went to Valbeck, and saw the great chimneys, the\ngreat smogs, the great slums, and heard the Weaver speak, that he began to\nglimpse the truth. That the Union was itself a wheel, designed not by a\nsingle engineer but by a web of mutual interest, hidden influence and\ncollective greed, to raise up the rich and drag the poor down into the\nchurning waters. Well, now the wheel would turn, as wheels are made to do,\nand drive down the privileged, and lift up the downtrodden, and there\nwould be justice. There would be justice, and equality, and plenty for all.\nHe had cut the “dan” from his name. Guslav dan Turmric had become\nsimple Gus Turmer. Arguments with his family had borne no fruit so he had\ncut them off, too. He had been a stack of kindling waiting desperately for a\nspark. Then he met Judge, and his eyes were opened. There was no dry\ntheory with her, no sentimental compromises, no having to be patient, no\nconvincing the doubters. What some called madness he recognised as\ndiamond-edged clarity. The time for arguments in the teahouse, for pretty\nwords and fancy theories, was over. The grasping hands of the owners, the\nnoblemen, the king and his venal henchmen could only be opened by force.\nFire and steel would be the last words in their argument.\nAnother knight had killed two of his brothers, but they had him cornered"

Gus\nleft the pick stuck in his helmet, kicked the knight over with a clatter of\nfalling steel, pulled out his sword and charged for the royal box, its steps\nunguarded. He caught a glimpse of the king, mouth and eyes wide open, his\nStyrian mother, too, her face spattered with blood. If he could get to them…\nwhat a blow for the common man! A blow that would resound across the\nCircle Sea and around the world as if his clenched fist were the clapper of a\ngreat bell. The history books would record this as the day of the Great\nChange, and Gus Turmer as the man who ushered it in!\nExcept someone stepped in front of the king as Gus laboured to the top\nof the steps. No armoured Knight of the Body, just a nondescript, curly\nhaired fellow in plain clothes, with a strange, bland smile which did not\nquite touch his eyes. If this fool thought he could stop the changing of an\nepoch, rob the people, steal this moment, he was mistaken! Gus was the\ninstrument of history! He was a torrent that could not be dammed!\nHe raised his sword, shouting, “The Great Change!” The man seemed to\nshimmer, to blur. There was a blast of wind, and—\n“Oh dear,” said Orso. Mouth all numb. Could hardly make the words.\nHe’d been thinking when he let the footman buckle his sword on that\nmorning how pointless it was. How he’d never draw the bloody thing. Now\nhe fumbled it from the sheath. He got the blade caught on the back of his\nchair. Realised there was a piece of metal lodged in the split wood. Must’ve\nmissed his head by no more than a hand’s width.\n“Get behind me, Mother,” he said, pawing at her shoulder, but his voice\nwas an echoing burble. Like water sloshing at the bottom of a very deep\ndrain. His head hurt. His jacket felt all sticky inside. Bloody hell, was he\nwounded? Or was it someone else’s blood? That’s the thing about blood.\nKing’s or commoner’s, everyone’s looks much the same.\nWhere were the Knights of the Body? Weren’t they supposed to handle\nthis type of thing? The absolute point of the bastards, wasn’t it? He saw one\ndead with a piece of metal through his breastplate. So he could hardly be\nblamed. Where was Bremer dan Gorst? Had given him the day off. Insisted\non it. Terrible decision. Did Orso make any good ones? Couldn’t think of\nany. Probably the blame was his. It usually was. A king was just a kind of\nbin for all the blame to go in.\nNo one up here would be much use in a fight. Curnsbick had his hands\npressed to his horrified face. Kort had scrambled for the rear. Funny, when\ndeath’s on the table, how vitally important it seems that one be killed last."

As if he’d run a mile. Papers were fluttering down.\nScorched pamphlets. Whole thing was like a nightmare. One was still\nburning as it fell beside him. He scrubbed it out under his boot. Could’ve\nbeen dangerous. Almost wanted to laugh at that. But not for long.\nSomeone was coming up the steps to the royal box. A big man wearing a\ndark coat. Thin yellow hair stirred by the smoky wind. A cloth wrapped\naround his face so Orso could only see his eyes. Hard eyes. Furious about\nsomething. There was a sword in his hand. An old, cheap sword, but cheap\nswords can still kill you.\nAll seemed so unlikely. Orso was a pleasant fellow, wasn’t he? Always\ntried to see other people’s points of view. To be polite. He could hardly\nbelieve this man had come here to murder him. There might have been a\ndozen killers crowding towards the steps, and none looked likely to be\nmoved by politeness.\n“Oh dear,” said Orso again. Probably the best chance was if he met them\nat the top of the stair. But he was worried if he took a step he might fall\nover. Then a hand caught his shoulder.\n“If I may, Your Majesty?” It was Sulfur, brushing past and carefully,\nalmost daintily, stepping over High Justice Bruckel’s corpse. Orso had\nforgotten the magus was even there.\nThe big Burner raised his sword, the cloth over his mouth fluttering\nfaintly as he shouted something. “A great shame!” Orso thought it might\nhave been, a sentiment with which he could readily agree. He narrowed his\neyes, expecting that blade to swing down and split the humble\nrepresentative of the Order of Magi in half.\nBut Sulfur had already moved. With breathtaking, impossible speed.\nOrso’s eyes could barely follow him. His fist sank into the Burner’s gut with\na wet-sounding thud, so hard it folded him in half, lifted him right off his\nfeet then dropped him on the floor of the royal box like a heap of rags, his\ncheap sword clattering from his hand and bouncing harmlessly from\nCurnsbick’s leg.\nThe next Burner raised his shield. Sulfur’s fist was a blur that turned it\ninto flying splinters, folded the man’s arm back on itself, ripped his head\nhalf-off in a spray of blood and sent him flopping like a rag doll among the\nbenches below. Sulfur had already caught a woman by her hair, ripped her\nhead down and smashed his knee into her face with a bang so loud it set\nOrso’s ears ringing again.\nHe flinched as blood spotted the royal box, stared in horror as a man was\nsmashed into a shape no man should ever be with one chop of an open\nhand. Sulfur caught another under the jaw, a board cracking beneath his\nheel as he flung the man high into the sky, his echoing shriek fading as if he\nhad been shot from a cannon.

Sulfur backhanded a third man and sent him\ntumbling bonelessly end-over-end, tangled up with fluttering festoons of the\nbunting that had decorated the royal box.\nOrso was not sure whether he was trying to shield his mother or cling to\nher for support. In the space of a breath, maybe two, Sulfur reduced half a\ndozen assassins to flying meat. Corpses turned inside out, twisted into\ncorkscrews, popped open or crushed in on themselves. Worse than anything\nthe exploding engine had done to the people down near the tracks.\nA man screamed through the cloth around his face as Sulfur caught the\nwrist of his sword-arm, the joint popping apart in his grip, and dragged him\nclose. The scream turned to a bubbling groan, and there was a crunching,\ncracking, slurping, the back of Sulfur’s head jolting like a famished dog’s at\nits dinner.\n“An Eater,” breathed Queen Terez. Orso made a point of never arguing\nwith his mother. While watching a man rip into another with his teeth was\nno time to start. Orso’s father had fought Eaters at the Battle of Adua. When\nOrso asked him what it was like, he had turned pale, and said nothing. Now,\nas the man Sulfur had thrown into the sky plummeted down and crashed\ninto the ground thirty strides away, he finally understood why.\nThe last of the Burners was running. Orso caught a glimpse of her\nterrified eyes as she dropped her axe and bolted. Sulfur let the limp corpse\nfall, its throat one single glistening black wound. The air about his\nshoulders shimmered, like the horizon on a hot day. Orso flinched as the\nwoman burst into flames, fell to the ground on fire, thrashing and squealing.\nPerhaps they were living in the age of reason, but anyone proclaiming\nthe death of magic had done so, it seemed, a little prematurely.\nSulfur turned towards Orso with the very same smile he had worn before\nthe explosion. But what had been a bland salesman’s grin was become a\nmonster’s leer, dotted with shreds of flesh, his mouth daubed red, different-\ncoloured eyes twinkling with the reflected flames of the woman he had\nsomehow set on fire.\n“So, might I speak to the lord chancellor?” Sulfur asked.\nOrso was not sure what word he wanted to make, but what came from\nhis mouth was a breathy, “Uh?”\n“Regarding the funding for new track-roads, Your Majesty. Under the\nauspices of the Banking House of Valint and Balk.”\nOrso stood staring for what felt like a very long time, one hand weakly\nholding his mother’s limp arm, his sword dangling uselessly from the other.\nHe would have dropped it had his fingers not been stuck in the elaborate\nbasketwork. The first of the attackers lay on his side at their feet, the cloth\ntwisted from his stubbly face, a steadily widening pool of blood bubbling\nfrom his nose and mouth.\n“Yes,” muttered Orso. “Yes… of course.”\nSulfur looked down at himself and frowned, as if he had only just now\nrealised he was spattered red from head to toe.

He dragged a hank of bloody\nhair from between his fingers and flicked it away.\n“I should probably change first.”\nThrough the steady hiss in his ears, Orso could hear shouting. Sobbing\nof wounded. Cries for help. A breeze came up and kissed his sweaty face.\nPerhaps the future they were heading for was not quite the one that\nCurnsbick was selling. His knees felt very weak.\n“Sorry, Mother,” he muttered, flopping back into his chair. “Need to sit\ndown.”\nA Fitting Welcome\n“W\nhat the hell are we all here for anyway?” grumbled Downside,\nuncomfortable in his finery, though his finery came down to a new cloak\nover his scarred mail and having cleaned his boots for the first time in six\nmonths. He hadn’t even done a good job of that.\n“To give the Young Lion a fitting welcome,” said Clover.\n“Weren’t we fighting that Union bastard a few months back? Fitting\nwelcome for him would be an axe in the head.”\n“Axe in the head is your answer to everything,” muttered Sholla, who’d\nborrowed some mail for the occasion she could only make fit by tightening\nfive belts about her scrawny person.\n“All too true.” Clover nodded sadly. “And an inadequate response in\naffairs of state, I think it’s fair to say.”\n“In whats o’ what?” mumbled Downside, baffled.\n“This is all about presentation.” Clover nodded towards Stour’s War\nChiefs and Named Men, lining both sides of Skarling’s Hall. The best of the\nbest, and in their best gear, so many jewels and gildings being flaunted,\nClover was half-blinded by all the glitter whenever the sun came out.\n“Show o’ strength. Display o’ power. We don’t need a fire, ’cause the day is\nwarm, but they’ve banked the fire high just to show they can.” And indeed,\nthose unlucky enough to be standing close to the blaze were sweating\nthrough their mail from it. “It’s not so much what the welcome says about\nthe guest as what it tells the guest about the host.”\nDownside looked more baffled than ever. “What?”\n“Stour wants all these bastards here because it makes him look big,” said\nSholla.\n“Ah. Why didn’t you just say that?”\nClover sighed. “Because I have this girl to translate into halfhead for\nme.”\n“What the hell is this?” Greenway was pacing the room, making sure\neverything met his standards, as if he had any. Now he’d come up to Sholla,\nsneering so hard it was a wonder his skull wasn’t showing. “Why the shit\ndid you bring her?”\nClover heard Downside give a disgusted grunt and shot an arm out in\nfront of him ’fore he exposed Greenway’s skull for real.\n“You told me bring two o’ my best,” said Clover, with his usual calming\ngrin. Felt like a keeper in a menagerie, sometimes, always struggling to stop\nthe animals killing each other. “You didn’t want her here, you should’ve\ngiven more thought to what best meant.”\nGreenway made great spectacle of sucking his teeth as he turned away."

Sholla took it well. If you could say a rock takes a rain\nshower well. Downside, on the other hand, was a man who made a point of\ntaking everything badly.\n“Going to let that fucking arsehole sneer at one of our own?” he growled\nin Clover’s ear.\n“You sneer at her often enough.”\n“She knows it’s in fun.”\nSholla raised her brows. “How would I know that?”\nDownside ignored her. He ignored anything that might stop a fight from\nhappening. “She’s three times the man that fool is. He looks over here\nagain, I’ll break his fucking head open, Skarling’s Hall or no.”\n“By the dead.” Clover rubbed at the bridge of his nose. Great in a fight if\nyou kept him pointed the right way, but here was why they called him\nDownside. “What do you think you’ll find in his head worth having? Boy’s\nan idiot. He’ll trip over his own cock soon enough, then you can laugh at\nthe outcome without getting your hands dirty. If I’ve learned one thing, it’s\nthat there’s rarely any need to wade into the bitter ocean for your\nvengeance. It’ll wash up on the shore soon enough.”\n“I never been much for waiting,” grunted Downside, glaring daggers\nacross at Greenway, who was complaining at some Named Man whose\ncloak-buckle wasn’t to his liking. “Time comes you have to stand up,\nChief.”\n“Maybe, but I’ll tell you one thing for damn sure, the time’s not now.”\nAnd Clover grinned about the crowded hall like they weren’t dancing on the\nedge o’ murder. “Got to pick your moment, Downside. Can’t solve every\nproblem with your fist. Sometimes brain and mouth are better weapons.”\n“Those the weapons you been using, the last few days?” asked Sholla.\n“As a matter of fact. Went to meet old friends and neighbours, talk\nthings through.”\n“What friends and neighbours you got that aren’t here?”\n“Believe it or not, there was a time before I was nursemaid to you\nsquabbling geese. I’ve had a long and varied career. Many famous chiefs\ndown the years—”\n“Didn’t you kill most of ’em?” asked Sholla.\nClover’s smile slipped a little. “A few.”\nDownside was busy glowering. He was every bit as deadly with a\nglower as Greenway was with a sneer, a great fold jutting between his\nbrows and his little lips pressed tight together in his bush of beard. “Say\nwhat you like. I never had a problem I couldn’t solve with a big enough\nblade.”\n“Then thank the dead you’ve had simple problems. You get those on the\nbattlefield, but there’s none in Skarling’s Hall.”\nThe doors were swung open, and there was a rustle and a jingle as men\nshifted to see the Young Lion make his entrance.

He looked quite the hero\n—breastplate, boots and teeth all buffed to a pretty sheen—but it was the\nwoman beside him that really drew the eyes. She seemed to Clover to be an\nexception to the rule that men get more excited about a woman the less\nclothes she’s got on. Her dress might’ve been spun from sunlight, glittering\nas she moved. Jewels on her long fingers, and jewels at her long neck, and a\nlittle jewelled sword at her hip, too. You could hardly tell what she really\nlooked like under all that flash and flutter and dancing, prancing strut, but\nno one seemed to care. There was a jealous stirring among the warriors, an\nawestruck murmur as if some priceless gemstone had been lifted from its\ncase rather than a woman walked in through the door.\nThe soldiers and servants in her wake looked somewhat concerned by\nStour’s fighters bearing in on every side, festooned with steel. Even the\nYoung Lion himself, walking with a trace of a limp, for all he tried to hide\nit. But his wife glided down the middle like a swan down a river with roses\non both banks. She’d smile at one man or another as if at a particularly\nhandsome bloom, and he’d blink, or blush, or look down at his boots, hoary\nold warriors who’d laughed at red wounds humbled with a red smile.\nShe stopped beside Clover, and murmured something to her husband,\nand Clover wondered how her lips could be so pink and her eyes so dark\nand her skin so pale and perfect. Had to be painted on, like a face onto a\nCarl’s shield, but done with so much craft you could hardly tell. It was the\nclosest thing to magic he’d seen in Skarling’s Hall, for all Stour’s magi and\nseers and wise women.\nBrock took a step towards them, glanced at Sholla and said in very good\nNorthern, “My wife is asking whether women fight here.”\nClover shook himself like he was waking from a dream. “Well, now and\nagain in the North we run out o’ men. But we never run out o’ fights.” He\nglanced sideways at Sholla and leaned forward to murmur under his breath,\n“Then, between you and me, there are times you tell ’em not to fight and\nthey bloody do it anyway.”\nBrock rendered it into the Union tongue for his wife, and she gave a\nlaugh as glittering as her dress. Clover wondered how long she’d practised\nto get it just right but still felt greatly pleased with himself that he’d been\nthe cause of it, then greatly disappointed when she walked on. Downside\nstared after her like a fox at an open chicken coop.\n“Watch out,” muttered Sholla. “You might both die o’ thirst from all that\ndrooling.”\n“The Great Wolf!” called Leo dan Brock, spreading his arms as he came\ntowards the dais. “Greater than ever! King of the Northmen, no less!” And\nhe offered Stour his hand.\n“The Young Lion!” Stour rose from Skarling’s Chair. “Not as young as\nyou were, but no worse for that.” He caught Brock’s hand, and pulled him"

Then the two of ’em had one of those\nhugs which is halfway to a wrestling match, making out they were best of\nfriends while each tried to drag the other off his feet.\n“This is my wife, Lady Savine,” said Brock, once they’d finally fought\nthe hugging to an ungainly draw.\nAnd she sank down, rustling skirts spreading across the flags like a pool\nof gold, so smoothly it seemed she couldn’t have any legs at all under there\nbut was mounted on a well-oiled platform. “My king. It is my honour to\nmeet so great a warrior.”\n“Oh, I know a bit about honour.” Stour grinned down at her from the\ndais. “And it’s all mine.” Her Northern might be poor, and have a heavy\naccent, but she’d already worked out where to tickle the Great Wolf.

Patriots.”\n“Oh, aye?” grunted Stour, tossing a bone onto the floor.\nThe Great Wolf made no effort to hide his boredom at all this talk of tax\nand injustice and patriotism, and Leo hardly blamed him. When Isher spoke\nabout this stuff it made sense right off, but Leo was always tripping on the\ndetails. And here, at a feast in Skarling’s Hall, surrounded by red-handed\nwarriors, the arguments all sounded so flimsy and ridiculous. By the dead,\nhe was boring himself. There’d been enough bloody talk. What he needed\nto do was do. But one thing he’d learned over the last year—before you\ndraw your sword, you need to know how you’ll win.\nTo win, he needed the King of the Northmen.\nFlattery always did the trick for Savine. Leo puffed out his cheeks,\nlooking at the crowd of Named Men down the great horseshoe of tables.\n“You’ve summoned quite the host,” he said. “The North seems stronger\nthan ever. More united than ever.”\n“Why wouldn’t it be?” Black Calder leaned past his son to point a frown\nat Leo as hostile as a drawn dagger.\n“Now, now, Father.” Stour wagged a greasy finger. “I said be polite.”\nWhen it came to flattery, Leo was more used to taking than giving. He\nwished he was down there with the warriors, drinking and singing and\nslapping backs, with no worries but a sore head in the morning.

By the\ndead, diplomacy was hard work.\nHe felt Savine’s gentle touch on his arm. “You fought the man and\nwon,” she murmured in his ear. “Surely you can talk to him?”\nThe thing about killing a man—you could do it in a moment. Bringing\nhim around to your way of thinking took so much patience. And how could\nyou even tell when it was done? Kill a man, he stayed dead. Change his\nmind, he always had the bloody chance to change it back.\n“Reckon I’d rather fight him again.” He glanced over, and caught Black\nCalder glaring back. “Specially with his father judging every word.”\n“If I had known we were bringing overbearing parents, we could have\npacked some of our own.” Savine sat forward. “I must say that you speak\nthe common tongue wonderfully well, Lord Calder!”\nShe could usually slit a man right open with one compliment, but Black\nCalder was better armoured than most. “My own father always said it\nserves a man well to learn the ways of his enemies,” he grunted.\n“And even better to learn the ways of his friends. I have been trying to\ngarner some words of Northern, but I fear I am a poor study.”\n“Oh, no doubt.” Calder snorted. “The first thing I think when I look at\nyou is—there’s a woman who’s not crafty enough.”\nLeo clenched his fist around his eating knife. He was damned if he’d let\nthis old prick insult his wife, but before he could speak, Savine’s hand\nclamped tight on his sore thigh and cut him off in a pained squeak. “You, I\nthink, are a man with craft to spare.” The ruder Calder got, the wider she\nsmiled. “Perhaps you might tell me something of the history of Skarling’s\nHall.”\n“What am I, some bloody storyteller—”\n“Father!” growled Stour. “There isn’t a man in this hall wouldn’t kill for\nthe chance to teach the Lady Governor a few words of Northern. Stop\ninsulting my guests and make yourself useful.”\nWith bad grace, which seemed the only grace he had, Black Calder\nstood, leaned close to his son’s ear and whispered loud enough for everyone\nto hear. “They want something. Don’t say yes because you feel you should,\nor because you feel you’re bored, or because of anything you feel, you\nunderstand? Make sure they pay.”\n“I know what to do,” snapped Stour.\nSavine gave Leo a wink as she took Black Calder’s bony hand and let\nthe old man lead her from the dais. “Black Dow fought the Bloody-Nine\nright there,” he was saying.\n“You saw it yourself?” breathed Savine, as if she’d never been so\nthrilled.\nStour worked his tongue around his sharp teeth as he watched them go.\n“Whatever my father says, it’s quite the honour to host you, Young Lion.\nAnd your wife, who’s clearly as clever as she is beautiful and I daresay\nknows a lot more Northern than she’s letting on.

But I don’t reckon you\nsuffered our roads all the way up to Carleon for my ale and my father’s\nstories.” He licked his fingers while he looked sidelong at Leo. “What are\nyou after?”\nNow was the moment, then. Courage, courage. He was the Young Lion,\nwasn’t he? He leaned in, speaking in an urgent whisper. “The Closed\nCouncil have to be stopped.”\n“And you’re the man who’ll do it?”\n“We’re the men who’ll do it.”\nStour raised one brow, as if he had his doubts.\n“I want you with me on a grand adventure!” Leo tried to elbow through\nthe detail and summon up some passion. “To win glory, and set the world\nright, and make friends of every decent man in the Union!”\nSad to say, Stour didn’t slit his hand and swear a blood oath to their\nalliance on the spot. Instead, he sat back, toying with his ale cup.\n“So… you’re asking for warriors of the North… to sail to Midderland in\ntheir thousands… and fight against the big king in Adua?”\n“Yes!” Leo thumped his knife point-down into the table and left it\nwobbling there. “You see it!”\n“Who’s with you?”\n“The great lords of the Open Council. Isher, Heugen, Barezin and more.\nFamous names.” Leo paused. But he’d been honest with Rikke. Honesty\nwould serve him best with Stour. “And Uffrith.”\nNightfall showed his teeth. You couldn’t deny he was a handsome\nbastard, especially when he was angry. “Paid that Long-Eyed little witch a\nvisit, did you? The two o’ you used to be proper close, if I remember.” Stour\nstuck his greasy thumb in his mouth and made a little popping sound. “You\ngot a way with the women, Young Lion, that I can’t deny.”\nLeo glanced towards Savine, who was draining an ale horn while a\ngroup of warriors watched in rapt admiration. Even Black Calder had a look\nof some respect as she wiped her mouth and held it out for more. “Please,”\nshe said, “my mother drinks more on a workday morning.”\nThose men who could speak common laughed, and the ones who\ncouldn’t pretended they could and laughed even louder.\n“But I’m not a woman,” said Stour, “and my father might be quite the\ncarper, but he knows a thing or two. So the question keeps drifting past—\nwhat’s in it for me? You offering a piece of Midderland?”\nLeo laughed. “No one in the Union would ever stand for that.”\n“A slice of Angland?”\nLeo frowned. “I’d never stand for that.”\n“Uffrith, then?”\n“I think we settled that question in the Circle,” said Leo stiffly.\n“Daresay you want me on my best behaviour, too.” Stour stuck out his\nbottom lip. “Not even a little pillage on the way to battle.”\n“We have to get the people of Midderland on our side,” said Leo. “We’re\ncoming to free them, not rob them.”\n“So, the way you’re telling it, your grand adventure’s going to cost me"

I’m a real loveable bastard.”\n“Think of it, though! The Young Lion and the Great Wolf, side by side!\nOur banners flying together!” Leo shook his fist between them, trying to\nlight the fire in Stour he always felt at the thought of armoured men\ntramping, horses prancing, cheers of triumph. “Think of the songs sung of\nour victory!”\nBut all Stour gave Leo was another dose of the side-eye. “Once you’ve\nheard one song of victory you’ve heard ’em all. Swap the names out and it’s\nthe same spears shaken and horns blown and bodies carpeting the glen and\nall that shit. You see my friend Clover down there?” And he pointed out that\nbalding bastard, the one who’d had the girl beside him with all the belts.\n“That fat fool used to be Jonas Steepfield.”\n“Steepfield?” Leo frowned. “The one who held the pass at Grey Breaks?\nThe one who killed Cairm Ironhead?”\n“Aye. That one. He had all the glory a man could ask for. Now look at\nthe fucker.”\n“I thought you and I were the same!

Ain’t just a question of winning, it’s what you win.”\n“I’d rather not bring up your debt—”\n“Don’t, then.”\nLeo carried on through gritted teeth. “But there is one.”\n“My life, you mean?” Stour grinned. “The men the Bloody-Nine beat in\nthe Circle were bound to serve him all their days, but we live in different\ntimes. And even if I was willing to clean your boots, no one else here owes\nyou a fucking thing. You’ll find no one better with a sword than me, Young\nLion. You know that.

But virtues she was starting to appreciate. Even to admire. He was a\ndecent man, in several ways that actually counted. Enough to make her feel\nalmost decent when she was beside him. And that was a pleasant feeling.\nCertainly a refreshing one.\nHe shifted in his sleep, drawing the furs up around his chin. For such a\nstrong man, such a bold fighter, he could be strangely childlike. So trusting,\nso optimistic, so vain. He treated the world like an implausible storybook\nand, though it had thus far played along, she doubted it would do so for\never. Their mothers had been right, they were well matched. The impetuous\noptimist and the calculating cynic. He was not weighed down with\nexcessive cleverness, but a clever husband would only have got in her way.\nShe was glad she had married him. The world needs heroes.\nBut it also needs people who will actually get things done.\nShe stood, and smoothed her skirts, and checked her face one more time\nin the distorting square of old mirror. Then she slipped out of the door and,\nso as not to wake her husband, ever so gently pulled it shut.\nThe one called Greenway was skulking in the corridor outside. It\nseemed when it came to Northmen, the more picturesque the name, the\nmore of a self-regarding thug it belonged to.\nHe gave her a leering look up and down. “Can’t give you long.”\nGold flashed in the shaft of light from the narrow window and she\npressed the coin into his palm. “Best not waste our time, then.”\nShe heard the blades before she saw them. That familiar scrape of steel,\nshuffle of feet, grunting of snatched breath.\nShe stepped out into a narrow yard beside Skarling’s Hall, a circle of\npatchy lawn hemmed in by grey stone walls, a training dummy in old mail\nand battered helm leaning against a rack of swords and spears.\nTwo men prowled the edge of the grass with shields and long sticks,\nbulky with straw matting. Stour stood between them, sword in hand,\nstripped to the waist, lean and muscular and shining with sweat, steaming\nfaintly in the dawn chill. Savine wondered if this display of raw manliness\nwas for her benefit. More than likely. Who understood the importance of\nappearances better than she did, after all?\nThe so-called Great Wolf sprang hissing at one of his training partners,\nso suddenly and so savagely Savine put a protective hand over her belly on\nan instinct. She had to force herself not to jerk back as Stour chopped at the\nshield and sent splinters flying, ducked the stick and darted under it,\nshoving the man against the wall with his shoulder and making him grunt.\nStour caught the rim of the shield, kneed the man in the gut, then dealt his\nleg a vicious blow with the flat of his sword and dropped him mewling on\nthe ground.\nAll done in a couple of breaths’ worth of focused violence, so that as his\nother training partner lumbered up, the King of the Northmen was already\nprancing away on the balls of his feet.

Through sweat-dark hair, his eyes\nslid over to Savine.\n“Like what you see?” He spoke the common tongue after all. But she\nhad guessed that at the feast, from the way he had listened to her and Leo\ntalking.\n“Who wouldn’t?” She made herself step forward, around the fallen man,\ngroaning as he clutched at his straw-padded leg. “The Great Wolf!\nGrandson of Bethod and rightful King of the Northmen! The greatest\nwarrior in the Circle of the World, they say, and I can well believe it.”\n“You’re almost as quick with a compliment as I am with a sword.” Stour\nloosed a flurry of lightning jabs at the man still standing, point gouging at\nhis shield fast as a woodpecker and making him shuffle nervously back.\n“No more than the truth.” It was a while since she’d stepped into a\nfencing circle herself, but she knew enough about swordsmanship to see his\nskill. He was even better than Leo. But even more vain, too. She wondered\nwhether that preening arrogance would make an effective shield if Bremer\ndan Gorst came for him meaning business. It was something she would\nrather like to see.\n“Can’t say I don’t enjoy your flattery,” he said, grinning, “but if you\nwant my warriors, you’ll need to offer me more.”\n“Of course. I will need a gift fit for a king. I was thinking, maybe…\nUffrith?”\nStour froze, sword back for another jab. “Eh?”\n“A city by the sea. One of the North’s greatest, I am told, though in truth\nit seemed a little… primitive to me.”\n“Well,” he whispered, narrowing those horrible wet eyes at her. “We’re\nknown more for our swords than our cities up here.” He dodged a swing of\nthe stick without even looking, caught it with his free hand, slipped around\nthe shield and clubbed the straw-strapped warrior in the face with the\npommel of his sword.\nThe man gave a sharp cry as he fell to his knees with his hands to his\nbloody mouth. Stour gave a sneer of disgust as he planted his boot on the\nman’s chest and shoved him onto his back. “Didn’t realise Uffrith was\nyours to give.”\n“It is mine to let you take.” Savine walked closer, shrugging as if they\ntalked of the weather. “What’s a Protectorate without anyone protecting it,\nafter all?”\n“Available.” And Stour nudged his fallen sparring partner towards the\narchway with a lazy kick. “You got some bones, woman, stepping into the\nwolf’s jaws this way. Got to admire that. But I do worry.” He rolled the man\nover with another kick and made him squeal. “I worry you might be one o’\nthose folk likes to promise everything to everyone and somehow thinks\nshe’ll never be called on to pay.”\nHe stepped closer, raising his sword, point towards her, and it took all\nher courage to stand her ground. She could tell from the murderous glint on\nits edge that this was no practice blade. “I worry you can’t be trusted.” And\nhe brushed her neck gently with the point."

She could tell from the murderous glint on\nits edge that this was no practice blade. “I worry you can’t be trusted.” And\nhe brushed her neck gently with the point.\nThey called him the Great Wolf and Savine did not doubt he was well\nnamed. She could hear his growling breath. Smell his sour sweat. A wild\ndog indeed. And you cannot show a dog your fear. Her skin crawled, her\nheart thudded, but she forced herself to stand still, forced herself to meet his\neye as the cold point tickled at her throat, then along her shoulder, caught\nsomething just inside her collar and eased it out.\n“After all…” Dangling from the end of his sword was the necklace of\nrunes Rikke had given her. “Aren’t you and your husband best of friends\nwith that fucking witch?”\nIt was an apt word for Rikke these days. Savine had almost flinched at\nthe sight of the tattoos inked into her bony face, one of the pale eyes she\nhad once so admired seeing nothing, the other far too much. She thought of\nRikke’s hand resting on her stomach. Her delighted laugh as the baby\nshifted. The truest person he knew, Leo had said, and Savine felt a pang of\nguilt. A rare thing for her. Rarer than ever, since Valbeck. But she had\nchosen her path, and it led to the throne, whoever she had to step over on\nthe way. Conscience would have been even worse to show than fear.\n“Trust is a poor foundation for an alliance. Almost as poor as\nfriendship.” Savine stared at Stour down the blade of his sword. “Both can\nshake loose in a storm, and there is a storm coming. Self-interest, on the\nother hand, has deeper roots. We need you. And you need us. Today, and\ntomorrow. Rikke is useful to us today. But afterwards…?”\nShe stepped forwards. Stepped forward so suddenly she gave Stour no\nchoice but to stab her through the throat or pull his sword away. Close as\nthey were he had no room, caught his arm against his body, twisted his\nwrist clumsily and had to let his sword drop, clattering down between the\ntwo of them.\n“Afterwards, you will be lord from the Whiteflow to the Crinna and\nbeyond. A true King of the Northmen.” She sank down, and took his sword\ngently by the blade, and offered the hilt to him as she stood. “All of them.\nSomething I understand your father could never quite manage.”\n“Well, in that case…” He wrapped his fingers around the grip, his eyes\nflicking about all over her face and his teeth bared in a hungry grin. “You’ve\ngot yourself a deal.”\n“Of course.” She smiled as she stepped away. As if she never had any\nfear, or any conscience, or any doubts at all. If you think it often enough,\nperhaps it makes it so. “I never offer deals until I know they will be taken.”\n“Reckon I’d better gather my warriors.”\n“The best you have, and plenty of them. If we lose, you get nothing.”\n“I’ll empty the North o’ men!” growled Stour. “A host that hasn’t been"

Towards\nher husband. Towards safety.\n“I’m guessing the Young Lion doesn’t know about this?” called Stour.\n“There are things decent men will not do, but some of them must be\ndone. That’s why he has me.”\n“And when he finds out?”\n“I daresay he will be upset, but… by then the North will be yours.”\n“And the Union yours.”\nAnd its new king and queen would have bigger concerns.\nStour grinned. “I like your husband. He’s got a lot of heart. But do you\nknow the thing I’m getting to admire most about him?” He turned and\nswung in one slick motion, sword flashing in the sunlight, and struck the\ndummy’s head from its straw-stuffed shoulders, battered helmet clattering\naway into a corner. “His taste in women.”\nQuestions\nT\nhey’d worked on his hand.\nThe bruises on his face and the cut above his eye were faded. Probably\nhappened when they blew up Curnsbick’s engine. But the hand was more\nrecent.\nThere was nothing artful about it. Smashed with a hammer, maybe. One\nof those hammers with teeth that butchers use to make meat tender. It\nlooked like he was wearing a big, red, floppy glove. It looked like\nmincemeat moulded into the shape of a hand by a bored butcher. It certainly\ndidn’t look like a hand that would be attempting to kill any kings again\nsoon. Or doing anything much ever.\n“You know they’ve barely started,” said Vick.\nHis red-stained eyes crept across to her.\n“What they’ve done there…” She glanced down at that mess on the end\nof his arm. “Is just to show you they mean business. That’s a handshake. If\nI’m not happy with your answers, well…” She leaned forward to whisper,\n“I hear Old Sticks has taken a personal interest in your interrogation.”\nHe swallowed, the lump on his throat shifting.\n“And once Old Sticks gets out the instruments…” She gave a long, soft\nwhistle. “You’ll be begging for them to shake the other hand.”\n“I told ’em everything I know,” he croaked out.\n“Everyone does. But they might’ve missed something. You might’ve\nmissed something. Something you didn’t even realise mattered.”\n“Will it make any difference?”\n“It might.” To her, at least. For him, there was no help. His Majesty’s\nInquisition tended away from leniency when it came to attempted regicide.\n“Who planned it?”\n“The Weaver…” he croaked.\nVick narrowed her eyes. “Risinau?”\n“Never met him.” He shrugged as if lifting his shoulders took all the\nstrength he had. “That’s what they told me.”\n“Who told you?” His head was slipping sideways, eyelids fluttering.\nVick snapped her fingers in front of his face. “Who told you?”"

Foreman would make\nher work late some days. Asleep on her feet, but we needed that job. One\nday she stumbled, and the buckle on the drive belt caught her. They said it\nsnatched her off her feet like the hand of Euz. Flung her twenty strides into\nthe ceiling so hard she broke one of the beams. Hardly had a bone in her\nbody wasn’t shattered. Her head then looked worse’n my hand now.” He\nspat the words, tears starting to gather in his eyes. “So I got no regrets! The\nWeaver gave me the chance. Strike a blow for the common man! Our blow\nmight’ve missed the mark, but it won’t be the last.”\n“Oh, don’t be too hard on yourself,” said Vick. “Your blow didn’t miss\neveryone. It killed dozens of honest folk who’d come to watch an engine\ntoddle across some fields on a summer morning! What about those poor\nbastards, eh? What about their wives and husbands and fathers and\nchildren? We’ve all got sad stories, arsehole!”\n“Sacrifices have to be made! Would’ve been worth it, if His fucking\nMajesty didn’t have that Eater watching him.”\nVick frowned. She’d had a sense something had been cut from the\nreports. “Eater?”\n“We had the knights beaten! Then that little nothing-looking bastard…\nhe killed Turmer. Killed ’em all. Flung ’em about like they were straw.”\nShe remembered what Shenkt had done to those two Practicals, on the\nquay in Westport. Big men, tossed like dolls.\n“But it don’t matter what devil deals you strike.” The prisoner nodded to\nhimself, a strange little smile quivering on his lips. “Don’t matter how many\nEaters you bring, or how many soldiers you hire, or how many folk have to\ndie. There’s a Great Change coming.”\nVick gave a weary sigh. “Where’s Judge?”\n“A Great Change.” His bloodshot eyes had drifted beyond her, gazing\ninto the bright future, maybe. “And all the owners, and the bankers, and the\nkings, and the magi shall be swep” away!\nShe remembered what Vitari had told her, in that shack on the Westport\nwaterfront. That the Union was Bayaz’s tool, the banks and the Inquisition\nhis puppets, that she was already dancing to his tune.

Or\nat least for some questions.\n“Your Eminence, I have some questions about—” She stopped with\nBayaz’s name on the tip of her tongue as Glokta’s guest turned in his chair,\nraising an urbane eyebrow.\n“Inquisitor Teufel!” It was only the bloody king. “I never got the chance\nto thank you for your help in Valbeck. You made me look good, and that\ntakes some damn doing. That note of yours saved my arse, not to mention\nseveral thousand others.” His smile faded somewhat. “Shame it couldn’t\nsave everyone’s, really.

But as the silence\nstretched, she began to consider that bit about the lifeboat and cleared her\nthroat again. “Is… the ship sinking, then?”\n“There might be some bailing to be done,” came a voice from behind.\nVick turned, surprised. A man was leaning against the wall beside the door.\nA man she somehow had no inkling was there until he spoke. An\nunexceptional man with curly hair. Average height, average build, average\neverything. The very look Vick aimed for herself, when she wanted to blend\ninto anonymity. The exceptional ordinariness of the expert spy. Or the\nmaster assassin. It put her instantly on guard.\n“Do you know Yoru Sulfur?” asked Glokta.\n“We have never met,” said Sulfur, “though I, too, am a great admirer of\nyour work in Valbeck.” He gave her a neat little bow. “I was once\napprentice to the First of the Magi.”\nVick kept her face carefully neutral, but it was a struggle. Shenkt had\nsaid the Union was Bayaz’s tool, and now she found his agent at his\ngrinning ease with the nation’s two most powerful men. “And now?” she\nasked.\n“His watchful eye, his sympathetic ear—”\n“His punishing fist?” asked Orso.\n“Let us say his guiding palm,” said Sulfur. “By all means, pretend I am\nnot here.”\n“Not easily done,” murmured the king, holding out a folded paper to\nVick between two fingers. “I received another eye-opening note this\nmorning. One that may give us more bailing to do than in Valbeck and\nWestport combined.”\nVick took it, unfolded it and began to read.\nYour Majesty,\nThere is a plot against you.\nYour Open Council plans to steal your throne.\nThey have powerful allies in the North. They look for more in Styria.\nThey will land their troops on the northern coast of Midderland on\nthe last day of summer, declare themselves patriots and march on\nAdua.\nYou should prepare. But you should have care how you prepare.\nThere is a traitor in your Closed Council, too.\nWith Best Wishes,\nA Friend\nVick swallowed, her skin unpleasantly prickling. A plot. The Open\nCouncil. Allies in the North and Styria. A traitor in the Closed Council. This\ncould be a threat to make the uprising in Valbeck look like a village dance.\n“A Friend?” The writing was odd. Carefully formed. Almost a little\nchildlike. Vick turned the letter over, studied the ink, felt the paper, smelled\nit, even. But there were no clues to who wrote it. “Any idea who this friend\nmight be?”\n“None,” said Glokta. “But people keen to declare themselves a friend\nare usually anything but.”\n“Even enemies can tell you the truth,” said Orso. “Relations between the\nCrown and the Open Council haven’t been this bad since… well, the last\ncivil war, I suppose. Probably best not to dwell on how that ended…”\nWidespread murder and destruction culminating in the violent overthrow"

Probably best not to dwell on how that ended…”\nWidespread murder and destruction culminating in the violent overthrow\nand execution of a king. She placed the letter carefully on the Arch Lector’s\ndesk. “Who on the Open Council might have the audacity, the grievance\nand the resources for treason?”\n“Just about any of them.” Glokta licked at his empty gums. “Just about\nall of them.”\n“But if I had to pick a man to declare himself a patriot while doing it,\nIsher would be the one.” Orso disgustedly adjusted his cuffs. “He tricked\nme into that mistake with Wetterlant, and I’ve no doubt he manoeuvred Leo\ndan Brock into his little display of petulance at the trial.”\nThe Arch Lector was looking even more pale than usual. “Isher and\nBrock were married together…” One of them to his own daughter, as they\nwere no doubt all well aware.\n“Enemies on the Open Council are one thing,” said Vick. “Their military\nresources are limited. The Lord Governor of Angland is another. He\ncommands an army of thousands. Well equipped, experienced, loyal.” That\nprickling sensation was spreading. “Could Brock be a part of this?”\nThe king took a long breath through his nose and let it sigh away.\n“Powerful allies in the North…”\n“Your Majesty.” Glokta winced as he tried to straighten in his wheeled\nchair. “If suspicion falls on my son-in-law, it must also fall on my own\ndaughter. As your Arch Lector, I must be above reproach. I should tender\nmy resignation, or at least recuse myself from this—”\nOrso waved it away. “I won’t hear of it, Your Eminence. You’re the one\nman on the Closed Council I entirely trust. You’re simply far too widely\nhated to make a good conspirator.”\nGlokta gave a weary snort. “Immensely kind of you to say so, Your\nMajesty.”\n“Besides, we have no evidence. The one thing I’m sure Leo dan Brock is\nguilty of is finding me contemptible. If that’s a crime, I’ll have to hang\nthree-quarters of the country. Have you seen the latest pamphlets? About\nme? About my mother? About the debt?”\n“Outrageous lies, of course,” threw in Sulfur.\n“Yet people can’t get enough of them.”\n“We could arrest Isher,” offered Vick. “I daresay we could pry the truth\nout of him.”\n“Tempting.” Glokta shook his head. “But after that business with\nWetterlant, no one on the Open Council trusts us. We cannot afford to hand\nthem more martyrs. We must tread carefully and bring plenty of proof\nwherever we go.”\n“In the meantime, we take the advice of our anonymous friend and\nprepare,” said Orso. “We raise our own forces, we gather every ally we can\nfind.”\n“We are spread thin, Your Majesty.” Glokta spread his thin hands. “The\nKing’s Own are scattered across the Union keeping down the Breakers.”\n“Colonel Forest helped me raise several thousand soldiers to fight in the"

The Crown Prince’s Division.” Orso smiled, as if at a happy\nmemory. “It might be re-formed.”\n“At a cost.”\n“In such dark times as these,” said Sulfur, “I have no doubt that the\nBanking House of Valint and Balk would prove generous.”\nAgain, Vick kept her face expressionless, but she nearly shivered at the\nmemory of Shenkt’s chill breath on her cheek. He had spoken of Valint and\nBalk, too.\n“By generous,” said Glokta, wiping a long tear from his cheek as his\neyelid flickered, “I assume you mean further loans at even more crippling\nrates of interest?”\nSulfur gave a good-natured shrug. “They are a bank, not a charity.”\n“Better to put my crown in hock than have it stolen, I suppose,”\nmurmured Orso, though Vick wondered if there was much difference.\n“I will go to the North on the next tide,” said Sulfur. “My master has\npowerful friends there. If this rebellion is real, it may be that I can nip it in\nthe bud.”\n“As you nipped the Burners at the demonstration of Curnsbick’s\nengine?” asked Orso.\nWas Sulfur the Eater, then? Another like Shenkt? From the white-\ntoothed smile he gave the king, it was not that hard to imagine. “I would\nhope more subtly,” he said, “but no less decisively in defence of Your\nMajesty’s interests.”\n“As long as my interests coincide with your master’s, I presume.”\n“I dare not imagine where they could diverge.” And Sulfur slipped out,\npulling the door shut with that final click.\nGlokta sat forward, hands clasped. “Inquisitor Teufel, I would like you\nto observe the other members of the Closed Council. Subtly, of course. If\none of them is disloyal, we have to know. Employ only people you trust.\nOutsiders, if possible.”\n“I serve and obey, Your Eminence. Your Majesty.” She stood, then\npaused with a hand on the back of her chair, thinking.\n“Something else?” asked the Arch Lector.\n“The note said they are looking for allies in Styria.”\nOrso raised one brow. “And?”\n“I may know some people who could help us there.”\nThe address Shylo Vitari had given her belonged to a basement near the\ndocks, odd lights glowing beyond the coloured glass in the windows, like\nthe lights they say lure sailors into the deep. A man with a battered sea\ncaptain’s hat and an even more battered moustache slumped against the\ncrooked railings outside with hands wedged in pockets, a sign creaking\nabove him, a woman with a spear and a bottle, a fish’s tail instead of legs\nand a smile that said she’d seen things you couldn’t dream of.\nThe place looked like a child’s picture of a nest of Styrian spies.

That or their contempt for the\nUnion was so great they weren’t even bothering to hide.\nThe steps led to a warren of gloomy cellars and low vaults that reminded\nher far too much of the mines in the camps of Angland. The coloured\ncandles were the flickering lamps as they shuffled into the dark, bent\ndouble. The clinking of glasses were the clinking of picks as they lay on\ntheir sides to nibble at the seam. The shadows writhing on the stained stone\nwalls were her own shadow as she shoved the coal tub on with her scabbed\nforehead, squirming down shafts too tight to sit up in, icy water lapping at\nher raw knees, knowing that if the ceiling fell, if a flame caught gas, if\nwater broke through—\nShe shook herself, trying to shake free of the fear. That was all long ago.\nThat girl was gone, not trapped inside her, screaming to get out.\nA man lay rocking in a hammock, tattooed arms folded behind his head,\nsleepy eyes following her down the tunnel. A couple swayed together to the\nmusic of a plaintive violin. It wasn’t clear whether they were dancing or\nfucking or both, but Vick ruled nothing out. A woman shuffling cards on a\nruined chaise winked, then pointed on towards a bright space where the\nceiling was a little higher and Vick could stand straight.\nShe’d seen plenty of drinking holes, but never one so well stocked.\nShelves were crowded with bottles of gleaming crystal and bland pottery,\nutterly plain and absurdly ornate. One filled with floating worms. One with\na dagger for a stopper. One shaped like a grinning face with stones for eyes.\n“At last!” The barman’s accent was a strange cocktail—a slosh of\nStyrian and a dash of the Union with a few more ingredients which were\nharder to place. Tall and pale, with spiky red hair and a spiky red beard. He\nhad a white cloth over one shoulder and a little monkey squatting on the\nother and he smiled a wide smile full of good teeth. “Victarine dan Teufel\ngraces my humble establishment.”\n“Have we met?”\n“We’re meeting now. My mother calls me Cas.” He spread his arms to\ntake in the vast array of bottles. “But to everyone else I’m just the barman.\nYou don’t look like my mother.”\n“I think I’d remember. Who’s this?”\n“My monkey. What can I get you?”\n“What’ve you got?”\n“What haven’t I got?”\n“Has it ever occurred to you that the more choice there is, the harder it\nbecomes to choose?”\n“It has been mentioned. But fear is a poor reason to limit your options.”\nHe looked her discerningly up and down, like a tailor guessing a client’s\nmeasurements. “Tough day?”\n“Is there another kind?”\n“Have you ever tried Sworfene?” And he plucked an unassuming bottle\nof bubbled glass from the top shelf behind him. “It’s only made in one\nvillage near Jacra.

Don’t let the revolting smell put you off.”\n“I don’t generally.” Vick took a sip and swilled it thoughtfully around\nher mouth. Up in the camps, they’d distilled every rotten vegetable they\ncould get their hands on, but she’d still never tasted anything worse.\nSwallowing was against her every instinct. Afterwards, she could hardly\nbreathe. “What the hell’s it made from?” she croaked.\n“A secret more closely guarded than the colour of Queen Terez’s\nunderclothes. It’s an acquired taste.”\n“Why would anyone want to acquire that taste?” Vick found she was\ntaking another sip, shuddering as she swilled it around her mouth.\n“Strange, isn’t it? You keep having to check how disgusting it is. Then,\none day, you check and you find you actually like it. Soon after, no other\ndrink will quite scratch that itch. I’ve often felt that people are the same.”\nHe dipped the tip of his tongue into his glass and thoughtfully smacked his\nlips. “The ones you like straight away rarely turn out to be your favourites.\nI’ve a feeling you might be an acquired taste, Victarine dan Teufel.”\n“Are you flattering me?”\nHe held up his finger and thumb and peered at her through the tiny space\nbetween. “A little. But with a subtlety and class you don’t often get in Adua.\nShylo Vitari doesn’t like being embarrassed, but she likes people who can\nmanage to do it. She works on the principle that it’s your worst enemies that\nmake the best friends. Have you come to take up her offer of employment?”\n“No,” said Vick. “I’m happy where I am.”\n“Even though all the days are tough days?”\n“Adequately unhappy.”\n“So what brings you to my little patch of Styria-in-Midderland?” And\nthe barman raised his red brows as he took a sip of that disgusting spirit.\n“Or did you really just stop in for a drink?”\n“My employer… wants to meet with yours.”\nHe raised his brows even higher. “Old Sticks? Wants to meet with\nVitari?”\n“Let’s cut out the middlemen.” She tossed back the last of the spirit.\n“King Orso wants to meet with King Jappo.” Even the monkey looked\nshocked as she slid her empty glass back across the bar. “Pour us another,\neh?”\nTomorrow Came\nT\nhe thing Broad couldn’t believe about Valbeck was how much it hadn’t\nchanged.\nNot a year ago, smoke poured from the mills as they burned to black\nshells.

The river\nin its rotten banks was stained again from the dye-works upstream, choked\nwith boats and churned to particoloured froth by bigger waterwheels than\never.\nThe destruction of the uprising hadn’t put off the investors one bit, only\nopened up new opportunities. Scaffolds teetered everywhere, as if giant\nspiders were spinning webs over the city. There were barricades about, still,\nbut made from sharpened stakes rather than broken furniture, manned not\nby shabby Breakers but by King’s Own in bright uniforms, ready to crush\nany sign of disobedience with the full force of His Majesty’s heavily armed\ndispleasure. The queues of the broken and needy clogged the streets around\nthe manufactories, rain spitting down on ’em black from soot. Only\ndifference from the sorry processions Broad begged for work in a year\nbefore was that they were even longer.\n“Any o’ you know a man called Sarlby?” he asked, holding up his fist.\nWasn’t bothering to hide it any more. “He’d have a tattoo like this one.”\nSome flinched away. Some shook their heads. Some barely even seemed\nto hear him, lost in their own misery.\nThey’d nearly finished rebuilding the bank, and swabbed away the\nBurners’ slogans, and cleaned up the square before the courthouse. From\nthe three gibbets in front, though, they were doing nearly as brisk a business\nin hangings as when Judge was in charge. Round the corner, the whores\nwere doing brisk business, too, a clutch of ’em in bedraggled finery, hair\ngathered up to show bruised necks and skirts gathered up to show pale legs\nand paint smudged by the summer shower.\n“Any o’ you girls know a fellow called Sarlby?” Broad asked, holding\nup a silver mark.\n“You talk to those girls, it’ll cost you,” said a rat-faced pimp, skulking\nover from an alleyway.\nBroad gave him a look. “You sure?”\nThe man frowned, and twitched, and skulked back into the shadows.\nBroad turned his hand around to show the back. “He’d have a tattoo like\nthis one.”\nThe nearest girl shook her head. He gave her the coin anyway.\n“What do you want for it?” she asked, and Broad wondered how young\nshe was under that smeared paint. Young as May. Younger, probably.\n“Just take it.”\nHe trudged down a slum street not far from where he’d once lived, the\nway just rutted dirt and ashes and rubbish flung out from the houses, dark\nfrom the buildings leaning together and the washing flapping in the gritty\nbreeze. There were no drains, only pools of flyblown filth, fenced off in\nplaces to make pens for the squealing hogs, their run-off leaking through\nthe slit windows into the cellars where the poorest eked out some kind of a\nliving.\nFour men came past with a coffin up on their shoulders and a sad crowd\nat their backs.

Best\nclothes round here were the funeral clothes. They were worn often enough,\nafter all. Undertakers were great ones for persuading grieving folk to spend\nmoney they didn’t have. That way, debt could follow you even into the\nLand of the Dead.\nBroad stood aside to watch the mourners pass. Wanted to give ’em\nsomething. The way they’d all chipped in when he lived on a street like this,\neven when they had next to nothing to give. He wanted to give ’em\nsomething but he set his jaw against it. You can’t make every problem your\nproblem, Liddy was always telling him. And she was right.\nHe caught an old man limping along at the back in ragged black. “You\nknow a fellow called Sarlby?”\n“I don’t know no one no more.” And he limped on.\nThe warehouse the Breakers once met in was a shell of blackened\ntimbers. This was where they’d listened to Risinau, all huddling around his\nlies like a poor family around a one-coal fire, all staring off bright-eyed\ntowards that better tomorrow.\nAnd here it was. Tomorrow came, and it was much like yesterday. Just\nmore so.\nA couple of ragged boys were playing in an ash-black gutter, racing\nwoodlice or some such. Broad squatted down beside them.\n“You boys know a fellow called Sarlby?” They stared at him, big, round\neyes in their thin, dirty faces, like enough to be twins. But then the starving\nall look the same. “He’d have a tattoo a bit like this one,” said Broad,\nholding out his fist, then he turned it over, and opened it, and showed them\nthe silver coin glinting there.\n“I’ve a tattoo like that.”\nBroad smiled, but it was hard to keep smiling once he’d turned around.\n“Sarlby?” He hardly recognised the man he’d fought beside in Styria, stood\nbeside in Valbeck. His back looked bent somehow, and his hair was clipped\nshort and scattered with bald patches, and his face so lean you could almost\nsee the little fibres shift in his cheeks.\n“Gunnar Broad, back from the dead.” Sarlby’s voice had a throaty\ncrackle to it. Seemed he’d aged ten years in the ten months since they last\nspoke. “Heard you were looking for me.”\n“That I am.” Broad caught his hand and shook it, and thought how weak\nit felt. Like squeezing a glove full of dust.\n“I thought maybe you was one of the ones they hanged,” said Sarlby.\n“I thought maybe you was, too. Glad to see you’re not.”\nSarlby didn’t return the well-wishes. Didn’t look like he had much room\nfor ’em. “I see you’ve prospered,” he said, giving Broad a long look up and\ndown.\nSad thing was he’d picked the most threadbare clothes he could find.\nMaybe because he didn’t want to stand out. Maybe because he was shamed\nabout why he did. Even so, he looked like a rich man among these ghosts\nand beggars. He’d forgotten how bad it could get. Strange, how quick you\nforget."

The work, and the smoke, and the dust, and the sickness, and\nthe rank water and the rotten food and the bad living and the never enough\nof anything.\n“So where you living now?” asked Sarlby, out the side of his mouth as\nhe chewed.\n“In Ostenhorm.”\n“Angland, eh? Got work up there, then?”\n“Some.”\n“Not mill work, I reckon.”\n“No.” Broad thought about lying. But he owed Sarlby the truth, didn’t\nhe? Owed him that much. “Been working for Savine dan Brock.”\nSarlby gave an ugly snort. “Savine dan Glokta, you mean. The Darling\no’ the Slums! You ever see that pamphlet of hers?” He laughed, dry and\nchoking, and it turned into a cough, and he had to wash it down with the\nthin ale they served here. “How fucking stupid does she think we are?”\n“From what I’ve seen she’s a pretty good judge,” said Broad. “Of that\nand most everything else.”\n“And what does the likes o’ you do for the likes o’ her? Turn your hand\nto millinery, did you? Or have you gone from poacher to gamekeeper?”\n“I’ve done what I had to,” growled Broad, feeling the anger coming up\nhot. “I’ve got a wife and daughter to take care of. They’re happy for the first\ntime in years. You think I’m saying sorry for that?”\nSarlby held his eye. “Didn’t ask you to. Just want to know where you\nstand, is all.”\nBroad realised he’d got out of his chair and was bent over the table,\nclenched fists trembling on the wood and his lips curled back. Realised\neveryone in the wretched little place was looking at him. He blinked, and\nslowly lowered himself again, and made his fists unclench. Seemed an\neffort. Like there were barrel-bands around his hands, holding ’em shut.\n“I tried it your way.” He settled his lenses back on his sweaty nose,\nmade himself breathe slow. “Look where it got us.”\n“All we done was take a first step. There’ll be many more, on the road to\nfreedom. And much more lost along the way, I don’t doubt. Might be I’ll\nnever see the end of it.” Sarlby had the light of belief in his eyes. Or maybe\nthe light of madness. Maybe there was no difference. “But the day’ll come\nwhen my kind will. Depend on that, Bull Broad. There’s a Great Change\ncoming.”\n“So… you’re still with the Breakers?”\nSarlby slowly forked up the last of his food, and slowly chewed it, and\nlooked at Broad with narrowed eyes. “What’s it to you whether I’m with\n’em or not?”"

With the boys?”\nHe barked a disbelieving laugh at the painted ceiling.\n“Well, the wedding all happened in such a rush—”\n“A reckless charge, might you say?” asked Jurand, raising one brow.\n“They’re what I’m known for,” said Leo. “No time to give you bastards\nthe send-off you deserve.” He rubbed nervously at his sweaty throat. “And\nit won’t be all fun.”\nThat caused an awkward silence, glass clinking in the background.\n“When are you meeting the great King Jappo?” asked Glaward.\n“After sundown.”\nAntaup sat up. “Rubs me the wrong way, making nice with one of the\nUnion’s worst enemies.” And he punched a pillow as if it was King Jappo’s\nface.\n“You know what Stolicus said about enemies, don’t you?” said Jurand.\n“To kill an enemy is cause for relief,” intoned Leo, in that pompous way\nJurand trotted out the quotes. “To make a friend of him is cause for\ncelebration.”\n“You actually read it?”\n“Not a bloody page.”\n“Can you read?” asked Glaward, slinging a heavy arm around Leo’s\nshoulders.\n“I can’t,” said Jin, pulling a cork with a thwop and sniffing at the\ncontents. “And I’m fucking proud of it.”\nJurand rolled his eyes. “Can we even find our way to Cardotti’s? This\nbloody city’s a warren.”\n“A baking warren,” said Glaward, sniffing at the damp circle under one\narmpit.\n“Never fear.” Antaup slipped a dog-eared book from inside his jacket.\n“I’ve got Glanhorm’s famous guide to Sipani. And I can read. When I’ve\nnothing better to do.” He unfolded a cumbersome map from the inside\ncover and squinted at it in some confusion.\n“Does it show the landmarks, and so on?” asked Glaward.\n“Points of historical interest?” Jurand leaned over Antaup’s shoulder to\nturn the map all the way around. “I have to see the ruins of the aqueduct\nwhile I’m here—”\n“Glanhorm doesn’t cover any of that shit.” Antaup set his brows\nwaggling. “Just the brothels. And Cardotti’s House of Leisure is first on the\nfuck list.”\nJurand rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “That I have lived to hear the\nwords ‘fuck’ and ‘list’ spoken in sequence.” And he walked to the window\nand out onto the balcony.\n“Haven’t you bloody poured anything yet?” grunted Glaward, trying to\nshoulder Jin out of the way.

They jostled each other, then Jin caught\nGlaward’s head in a lock and they started to wrestle, barging into the\ncabinet and making the bottles rattle. With sorry inevitability, they worked\ntheir way down onto the carpet and started to roll about, snapping and\ngrunting.\n“D’you yield?” snarled Glaward.\n“Fuck yourself!” groaned Jin.\nAntaup stepped over them and plucked down a bottle, peering at the\nlabel. Leo’s leg ruled out wrestling, sadly. He followed Jurand through the\nstirring drapes.\nThe sun was sinking towards the hazy maze of roofs, glinting on the\nwater, sending pink and purple and orange flares through the heavens,\nbringing a hint of silver to the edges of the clouds. Below, outside some tea\nshop, or winery, or husk-house, or whatever it was they had here, a ragged\nviolinist was wending between the tables, trying to saw a few coppers from\nthe masked revellers with some sad little melody. It was sticky-hot, but\nthere was a breeze that tasted mostly of spice and adventure and just a little\ncanal rot, stirring the hair about Jurand’s face. The man simply didn’t get\nany less handsome. That proud, sad, thoughtful expression belonged on\nsome statue from the Old Empire.\n“Beautiful,” murmured Leo.\n“I know you don’t think much of Styria, but even you can’t deny…”\nAnd Jurand planted his hands on the pitted parapet and looked out at the\nsunset. “It’s a hell of a romantic setting.”\n“The very place for one last revel before a marriage.”\n“The marriage happened already, remember?”\nLeo frowned as he turned his wedding ring gently around on his finger.\n“Hard to forget.”\nThings hadn’t been quite the same between him and Jurand since he\ncame back from Adua. Since he came back with Savine. Some… spark\nmissing. He’d done nothing wrong, but he felt he’d let Jurand down\nsomehow. Broken some unspoken promise between them. He looked at Leo\nnow, that earnest, open look that always seemed to catch him right in the\nheart.\n“Are you sure about all this?” He dropped his voice to a whisper.\n“Rebellion?”\nLeo gave an impatient twitch. “We’ve been over it.” A thousand times,\nhe’d been over it. He was tired of the arguments. “I know you’re a thinker,\nbut sooner or later a man has to get on and do.”\n“Can we trust Isher and the rest? They’re not soldiers. They’ve never\nfought a battle—”\n“That’s why they made me the leader.”\n“I wish we weren’t keeping it from your mother. She could be a hell of\nan asset—”\n“The time comes for a man to leave his mother at home, Jurand. Along\nwith his doubts.”\n“I suppose…”\nLeo stepped up to lean on the parapet beside him. Close, so their\nshoulders were almost touching. Almost, but with a warm chink of Styrian\nsky between them. “Look, King Orso’s no soldier, either. We’ll be taking"

And when it comes to advice on strategy, I’ve got you!”\nAnd he gave Jurand’s shoulder a nudge with his and brought a flicker of a\nsmile to his face. “Couldn’t ask for a better man beside me! And lots of\nallies. Rikke. Stour. Who knows, maybe the Styrians, too.” He turned to\nlook out across the city. “If I don’t make a bloody mess of it tonight…”\n“Come on.” Jurand’s turn to give Leo a nudge. “You know you can be\ncharm itself when you want to be. Just flash that smile of yours and King\nJappo will be putty in your hands.” Leo grinned in spite of himself and\nJurand grinned back. “That’s the one.”\nA silence, then, while the violin played on, and a pleasure-barge drifted\ndown the grey-green canal below them, masked merrymakers lazing in each\nother’s arms on the upper deck. One of those moments you hope might last\nfor ever.\n“I need… to thank you,” said Leo. The words were hard to find, but he\nhad to try. “For being such a good friend. So patient and so loyal and… I\nknow I can be a little… self-absorbed.” Jurand gave a wry snort at that. “I\njust hope you know how much I love—” That word felt oddly dangerous, of\na sudden. But he couldn’t think of another that fitted. “All of you,” he added\nquickly, waving an arm towards the doorway, Jin and Glaward’s growling\ncoming faint from beyond. “Glaward’s my conscience, and Jin’s my\ncourage, and Antaup’s my charm, and you’re my—”\n“Awkwardness?”\n“I was going to say brains. I know how many disasters you’ve steered\nme clear of. Maybe you think I don’t notice, or I’m not grateful but, well…\nI do, and I am. I’m just… a lot better at taking credit than giving it, I\nreckon. You’ve always been there.” He winced. “I’m not sure… I can say\nthe same.”\n“’Course you can.” Jurand’s eyelashes fluttered as he looked away. As if\nhe was blinking back tears. “Life has leaders and followers, we all know\nthat. I’d follow you into hell, Leo.” And he looked back, and reached up,\nnot that far, and put his hand on Leo’s shoulder.\nThey’d touched each other a thousand times. They’d wrestled and\nsparred and hugged. But there was something different about that touch.\nMore than one old friend supporting another. Far more. Jurand’s hand didn’t\njust rest there. It squeezed, ever so lightly, and Leo felt a strange need to tilt\nhis head and press his cheek against it. Take that hand and hold it to his\nface, to his heart, to his mouth.\nJurand was looking him right in the eyes, lips slightly parted. “I want to\nsay…”\nLeo’s throat felt suddenly very tight. “Yes?”\n“I… need… to say—”"

Typical\nStyrians, all swagger and no action.\n“Well,” said Jurand, lifting his glass. “To the married man, eh?” And he\nslugged back his wine, the knobble on his long, slender throat bobbing.\n“Time comes we all have to grow up.” He sounded rather bitter about it as\nhe wiped his mouth. “Put our silly dreams aside.”\n“Aye.” Leo took a mouthful himself. “Reckon we should get ready. If I\nmake a mess of this, Savine’ll bloody kill me.”\nThe spell was broken. The strange moment was gone. Leo had to admit\nhe was relieved.\nRelieved and crushed, both at once.\nGrown Up\n“M\ny big brother!” And she held her arms out to Orso. “Come all the way\nto Sipani just to visit me!”\n“Carlot. Bloody hell, it’s good to see you.” And it was. She was a grown\nwoman, of course, with a definite hint of their father about her strong cleft\nchin, but all he could see was the girl who used to chase him around the\npalace gardens in happier times. He hugged her tight, and held her head\nagainst his shoulder, and had to manfully fight down a sudden urge to cry.\nShe frowned as she held him out at arm’s length. “You look a little…\npale.”\n“Rough seas on the way over,” he lied. “Being king suits me.”\nShe saw right through him, as always. “It never suited father. It ground\nall the fun out of him.”\n“Well, I’m not him.” Though he feared in fact he might be. “It’s brought\nout the responsible servant of the people in me.”\n“Who would have thought you were hiding one of those?” She lowered\nher voice. “You must tell me what urgent business has dragged the King of\nthe Union across the Circle Sea.”\n“I would if I could.”\n“Let me help, Orso. I do nothing here but choose wallpaper.”\n“And you’ve done a simply marvellous job of it,” he said, glancing\nadmiringly about the room. “You must choose some for me.”\nShe punched him on the arm. “Come on! I never get any bloody\nexcitement.”\nHe wanted to tell her how much trouble he was in. To moan that his\nsubjects were united only in contempt for their king. To blurt out that a\nconspiracy was building against him.\nTo say how lonely he was."

What could she do about any of it?\nHe made himself smile. “It’s all very boring. Nothing you need to worry\nabout.”\n“Not there with the boxes, over there!” The familiar sound of their\nmother scolding the servants echoed from the hallway. “And for the Fates’\nsakes, have a care!”\nCarlot puffed out her cheeks. “You’ve brought me plenty to worry about\nalready.”\n“Couldn’t you have got pregnant or something?” murmured Orso from\nthe corner of his mouth. “That would have been a perfect diversion.”\n“My womb does not exist so you can distract our mother. A sentence I\nhad hoped I would never have to utter.” She grinned as she nudged Orso in\nthe ribs. “It isn’t for lack of trying, I can tell you. Sotty’s quite exhausted\nwith his nightly efforts. For a big man, he’s surprisingly agile.”\nSotty was Carlot’s name for her husband, Chancellor Sotorius,\nsomething like the fifteenth ruler of Sipani to bear the name, only a few\nyears younger than Orso’s mother and probably twice the weight. He could\nbe something of a bore, but he doted on Carlot and had one of the best\ncellars in the world, so he was all right as far as Orso was concerned. The\nimage of the chancellor’s nightly efforts with his sister was not one he\nwanted to be haunted by, however, agile or otherwise.\n“That is… somewhat more detail than I required.”\n“You’re the one who brought my pregnancy into this. Prudery really\ndoesn’t suit you, Orso— Mother!”\nAs the Queen Dowager swept into the room, Carlot rushed over and\nadministered a loving embrace. Her technique, which Orso had long\nadmired, was to treat their mother as if she was being a tender and obliging\nparent regardless of her actual behaviour. “I’m so glad you came!”\n“Your husband is not here?”\n“Sadly, no.” Carlot flung herself down like a tragic heroine, shrugging\noff her mother’s displeasure with a flounce, like a duck flicking off rain.\n“Sotty’s got trouble with the assembly again. Sotty’s always got trouble. If\nwe eat together two nights a week we’re lucky. If it isn’t the assembly it’s\nthe merchants, and if the merchants are happy it’s the criminals, and if the\ncriminals take a week off it’s the pimps.”\n“I know just how he feels,” murmured Orso.\nHis mother raised a brow. “About the pimps?”\n“Not that.” He thought about it. “Well, yes, that, but I was referring\nmore to the demands of power.”\n“Indeed?” said his mother with withering sarcasm. “Still, I suppose we\nthree can dine together. Apart from Cathil it will be like having the family\nback together.”\nThere was an awkward silence. “Well, and Father,” said Carlot.\nAnother awkward silence. “And him,” said their mother. In all honesty,\nthe only times Orso could remember them dining as a family had been the\nweddings of his two sisters, and even then his parents had only come within"

In all honesty,\nthe only times Orso could remember them dining as a family had been the\nweddings of his two sisters, and even then his parents had only come within\narm’s length of each other when etiquette strictly demanded.\n“Unfortunately, I won’t be able to attend, either,” said Orso. “I have an\nengagement this evening. But we can dine together tomorrow. With Sotty,\ntoo, one can only hope. Then, sadly, I have to go back to Adua. Trouble\nwith the lords of the Open Council, you know. If it’s not the Open Council\nit’s the Closed, and if the Closed are happy—”\n“We can’t stay longer?” snapped his mother. “I wanted to spend some\ntime with my daughter!”\nThe silence went beyond awkward and into ugly. Orso glanced at Carlot,\nhoping vainly that she might do the hard work for him. She gave a helpless\nlittle shrug, batting the responsibility back his way.\n“What have the two of you arranged?” demanded his mother.\nHe gathered his courage, then puffed out his chest and met her raised\nchin with his own. “Mother. For the time being, I want you to stay in\nSipani.”\n“Absolutely not!” Her tone was so icy, it was a surprise her breath did\nnot smoke. “My place is in Adua.”\n“You’re always telling me how much you despise Adua.”\n“I despise Sipani just as much.”\n“You love Sipani.”\n“Did you bring me here just to get rid of me?”\n“No.” Even if he had. “Mother, listen to me—”\n“I always do!”\n“You never do!” He brought his voice back under control. “But this time\nyou must. At the demonstration of Curnsbick’s engine, you were nearly\nkilled.”\n“Come now, don’t exaggerate—”\n“High Justice Bruckel was sitting beside you and had his head cut in half\nby a piece of flying metal. He fell dead in your lap!”\n“Is that true?” asked Carlot, wide-eyed.\n“It will take more than flying metal to keep me from my son.”\n“Things have got no better,” said Orso. “If anything, they’ve got worse.\nWe have enemies everywhere.”\n“Then you need me. You need my advice. You need—”\n“What I need is to know that you’re safe. And Carlot deserves some\ntime with you.” Over his mother’s shoulder, Carlot theatrically rolled her\neyes. Orso ignored her. “I’ve been monopolising your attention ever since I\nwas born.”\nHe noticed there were grey streaks in her hair. Wrinkles around her eyes,\nat the corners of her mouth. When had she started to look old? It made him\nfeel deeply uneasy. He had always supposed she was indestructible.\n“Are you sure?” she asked.\n“I have made my decision, Mother. I hope you will accept it.”\nHe had expected a ferocious dressing-down. A furious Styrian tirade. Or,\nworse yet, the deadly gliding off followed by days of icy silence. But all the\nQueen Dowager of the Union did was cock her head on one side and calmly\nconsider him.\n“You have grown up, Orso. A bittersweet moment for a mother.”"

The best you can do is pass it on to your children.” She\ntouched him very gently on the cheek. “You understand why I was always\nso demanding, don’t you? Because I know you have it in you to make a\ngreat king.”\n“Your approval means… everything to me. It always has. And there is\none thing I need you to do while you are here. One thing with which I trust\nno one else. Certainly not myself.”\n“Name it.”\n“Find me a wife.” He counted the points off on his fingers. “I only ask\nthat she be beautiful, tasteful, passionate, cunning and superbly bred. And\nCarlot, make sure she has a sense of humour.”\nCarlot waved it away. “That would only be wasted on you.”\nA flicker of interest had crossed his mother’s face. “A Styrian bride?”\n“You know as well as I do that they make the best women in the world\nhere. Speaking of which, has our guest arrived?”\n“She has.” And Carlot gave a loud clap.\nThe door was swung open to reveal a tall woman in extremely\nimpressive middle age. Orso had not seen her in ten years, but she looked\nevery bit as elegant as the day she left Adua. If there was anyone in the\nworld who rivalled his mother for deportment, after all, it was her oldest\nfriend, and far more than a friend, Countess Shalere.\n“Orso, you beautiful creature!” she said. “It has been far too long.”\n“Countess.” Orso snapped his heels together and gave an extravagant\nbow. “Or should I say sorceress, since you have not aged a day.”\n“And people say you have no talents!” She clasped his head and kissed\nhim on both cheeks in a waft of perfume that took him straight back to\nbeing a boy. “I swear there are no better liars in the Circle of the World.”\nOrso’s mother had not taken her eyes from Shalere since she came into\nthe room. “This is… a surprise.”\n“A pleasant one, I hope.” Shalere raised one brow. “I have been waiting\nfor you for a long time.”\n“I… told you not to do that.”\n“Everyone must be disobeyed occasionally.”\nA naïve observer might have thought it an insignificant meeting. But\nOrso knew his mother far better than that. He saw the slight parting of her\nlips, the slight glimmer at the corners of her eyes, the slight movement of\nher collarbones with her quick breath.\nFor her, that was a whirlwind of passion.\n“Well,” said Carlot, making for the door and jerking her head\nsignificantly towards it. “I have some… things to do.”\n“As do I.” Orso felt suddenly as if he was intruding on something\npainfully intimate. “Immensely important… things.”\nNo one acknowledged him.

Long enough to see Shalere had taken both of his\nmother’s hands, their eyes fixed on each other, unwavering. His mother was\nsmiling. Her face lit up with it. He wondered how long it had been since he\nsaw her smile like that. Since he saw her smile at all.\nHe had been desperate to escape her smothering influence for years.\nNow that he had finally done it, he had to push the door shut before anyone\nnoticed the melodramatic quivering of his lip.\nAll Tastes, No Judgements\nI\nf there was one thing Leo valued, it was honesty, and Cardotti’s House of\nLeisure might’ve been the most dishonest place in the world. A place where\neverything was pretending to be something else.\nIt was decorated like the palace of some dissolute emperor, all fake\nmarble columns and false velvet, lulling music and forced laughter, clinking\nglass and whispered secrets. There were bronzes of naked people, paintings\nof naked people, colossal urns decorated with naked people. If it was\npossible to make nakedness boring, the decorators of Cardotti’s had\nmanaged it.\nWomen glided about the hallway with high shoes and hungry smiles,\nwith hair piled and twisted, with clinging clothes of shimmering pearl-white\nand glistening oil-black. Clothes that gave tricking glimpses of thigh and\nshoulder through slits and slashes, showed the laces and buckles of\nelaborate underwear.\n“By the dead,” muttered Glaward.\n“Very much so,” croaked Antaup, staring around with eyes wide in his\nmask.\nEverybody wore one. A Sipanese tradition, like fog, deceit and the cock-\nrot. Masks of crushed crystal and lace, leering devils and porcelain dolls.\nGlaward’s was a whale, appropriately enough, and Jurand’s a bird, Jin’s a\ngatehouse and Antaup’s a unicorn complete with crystal prong. Leo had, of\ncourse, a lion. What else? It had felt foolish when he put it on but now,\namong so many others, it started to feel dangerous. No one knowing who\nanyone was. No one having to take responsibility for what they did. No one\nbound by the usual rules, or by any rules at all. The thought made him\nexcited and worried both at once. His palms itched from it.\nA woman swayed towards them across the mosaic floor, snake-hipped,\nfeathers fluttering at her shoulders, holding long arms out in a showman’s\nflourish. “Welcome to Cardotti’s House of Leisure, my lords!” she crooned\nin a voice overripe with Styrian song.\n“Who says we’re lords?” asked Glaward, grinning.\n“We treat every visitor as if they are.” She brushed him under the chin\nwith a gloved fingertip, then looked at Leo. “You are the Young Lion?”\n“Some people call me that.”\n“It is our honour to entertain so famous a hero.”\nHe would’ve enjoyed the compliment more if he’d felt she was telling\nthe truth. If he’d felt she was capable of it. “Well, thank you—”\n“King Jappo is most keen to speak with you but… otherwise engaged"

The entertainments of Cardotti’s stand entirely at your disposal in\nthe meantime.”\n“I like the sound o’ that,” said Jin, giving Leo a punch on the arm that\nsent his weight onto his bad side and caused him a twinge of pain. It had\nbeen a mistake to walk here. Antaup’s map had led them wrong three times\nand the damn leg was hurting worse than ever.\n“Here at Cardotti’s, we cater for all tastes and make no judgements.”\nThe greeter led them past a half-open door, three figures lurking by\nlamplight beyond. They were dressed, or perhaps undressed, in much the\nsame way as the women, but they were decidedly not women. Stubbled\njaws. Chiselled bodies. By the dead, did he glimpse a muscular pair of\nbuttocks in the shadows? “We stand ready to indulge every whim.”\n“Perhaps we’ll just gamble to begin with,” snapped Leo, disgusted. And\nstrangely hot around the ears.\nShe led them into a panelled room noisy with the flutter of cards, the\nclick of dice, the whirr of the lucky wheel, surely the unluckiest invention\nof all history for its players. A band with masks like leering faces stroked\nand tickled and kissed out music which managed to sound somehow dirty.\nMasked guards lurked. Masked men pushed gambling chips wearily\nthrough pools of light stained by coloured Visserine glass. Masked women\nhung upon them, giggled at tiresome comments, swayed with the music and\ncaressed old grotesques as if they never saw such beautiful gallants.\nThe place looked like bribery, smelled like lust and sounded like\nblackmail.\nThe greeter spirited a box of chips into Leo’s hand. “Enjoy yourselves,\nmy lords.”\n“This place is vile,” he muttered as she glided off. He reached up to\nwipe his sweaty forehead, realised he couldn’t because of the mask.\n“You need to live a little!” Glaward swept two drinks from the tray of a\nwaitress with a mask like a golden octopus and started to swill one back\nwhile holding out the other.\n“I’d best stay sober. I’ve a deal to strike with one of the most powerful\nmen in the world.”\n“I haven’t.” Antaup plucked the drink from Glaward’s hand, took a\nmouthful, then bared his teeth. “Bit sweet.”\n“Like everything here—” Leo gasped at a touch on his shoulder and\nspun about. No assassin at his back, but a willowy blonde in a mask like a\nbutterfly.\n“No need to startle, my lord,” she pouted at him.\n“I’m not startled!” Though he obviously had been.\nShe giggled as if anxious bad temper was her favourite quality in a man.\n“I just wondered if I could be of any—”\n“No,” he snapped, turning away.\n“Yes,” said Jin, nipping in front of Antaup with surprising agility and\nslipping his arm through hers.\n“Aren’t you a strong one,” Leo heard her cooing as they headed for the\ndoor.\n“Glad someone’s enjoying themselves,” he grumbled, under his breath."

He was coming to\nrely on her more and more. To admire her taste, and her judgement, and…\nwell, everything really. But she trusted him to do this. He couldn’t let her\ndown.\n“Don’t worry.” Jurand, slipping up close to speak softly. Knowing Leo’s\nfeelings without a word said, like always. He guided Leo over to the dice\ntable. It was the right height to lean on, at least, and take the weight off his\nthrobbing leg without showing any weakness. “You’re the Young Lion! You\nconvinced Rikke and Stour to join you. United two bitter enemies under\nyour banner! Just be honest, and strong, and generous. Just be you.” Jurand\nleaned closer, grinning. “Only a bit more ruthless.

His eyes flicked to Leo, as blank as double ones. “Care to\nthrow?”\n“Why not?” Leo tossed a few chips onto the baize and flung the dice.\n“Two fives,” droned the dealer. “Player wins.”\nAnd he shuffled some chips towards Leo. As easily as that, he was the\nwinner. Leo wanted to grab Jurand and kiss him on the forehead but, given\nthat odd moment earlier, he threw a rough arm around him instead and put\nhim in a manly headlock. “What the hell would I do without you?”\nHe shoved a larger stack of chips out onto the table and snapped his\nfingers at Antaup. “Pass me those dice!”\nThe greeter at Cardotti’s House of Leisure was a work of art in herself, a\nmoving sculpture of black silk, paint and feathers, the very personification\nof Sipani’s succulent corruption. Or corrupt succulence. Whichever, really.\n“Your Majesty,” she said, dropping into a deep and graceful curtsy.\nAlmost as deep and graceful as the ones Savine used to perform, though her\nskirts had never split all the way to her hips in quite so mesmerising a way.\n“Probably best you don’t call me that,” murmured Orso, tapping the side\nof his nose. “Incognito, you know.”\n“Everyone is incognito here.” Her accent reminded him rather of his\nmother’s, which most certainly shouldn’t have been an arousing thought,\nbut somehow rather was. “At Cardotti’s, we are notorious for our\ndiscretion.” She leaned close. Even masked she managed to look\nmagnificently sly. “Among many other things.”\n“Indeed, I believe you once hosted my father?”\nThe greeter looked somewhat pained. “The night of the great fire.

A sad\nmoment in a proud history.” Gorst, for some reason, gave a kind of\nstrangled cough. The greeter took Orso by the elbow, resting against him as\nlightly as a fur sits on a lady’s shoulder, purring in his ear. “But the building\nhas been completely rebuilt since and our security is second to none.” She\ngestured to six armed guards, standing still as suits of armour against the\nwalls. “You could not be safer locked in a vault, I assure you.”\n“And we’d have a lot less fun there, eh, Gorst?”\nGorst followed in brooding silence, glaring about with fists clenched.\n“King Jappo is most keen to speak with you but… otherwise engaged\njust at the moment. The entertainments of Cardotti’s stand entirely at your\ndisposal in the meantime.”\n“What entertainments have you got, exactly?” asked Tunny, adjusting\nthe fit of a mask shaped like a silver star.\n“All of them.” The greeter led them into a dark-panelled hall where\ngames of skill, chance and ruination were being played. Groups of men sat\ntalking, laughing, smoking, drinking. Girls cooed and crooned and fluttered\nfans between them. Coloured light gleamed on fine glassware and soft skin,\nfiltered through amber drinks and curling smoke. Rarely if ever had such a\ntableau of high-class debauchery been assembled in one place, and Orso\nhad arranged quite a few himself, in his misspent youth. And his misspent\nadulthood, for that matter.\n“Despite all my protestations to the contrary,” he said, sucking in a\nbreath heavy with husk, musk and perfume, “I think at least half my heart\nbelongs to Styria.”\n“Reckon I’ve died and gone to heaven,” said Tunny, grinning hugely, “as\nthe Gurkish might say.”\n“To hell,” squeaked Gorst, heavy jaw firmly clenched beneath his mask\nof a crescent moon.\nOrso had attended quite a few masked balls and learned how to handle\nthem through pleasurable trial and error. The main rule was not to get\ncarried away and make an utter arse of yourself. A good rule under all\ncircumstances, in truth, but one that not everyone followed.\nFour men were gathered at the dice table. One in a unicorn mask\nslouched against it, shirt open to show a patch of sweaty chest, waving one\nfloppy hand in time to the band. Or, in fact, entirely out of time. “Lovely\nmusic,” he droned, “wonderful music.”\n“I told you not to smoke that pipe,” snapped a broad-shouldered one in a\nlion mask as he flung the dice down the table. They were from the Union,\nclearly. Angland accents, maybe? Four friends, but the lion appeared to be\nthe leader.

And my sister lives in the city.” Orso lowered his voice.\n“Took the opportunity to palm my mother off on her. I love the old bird but\nshe won’t stop going on at me to marry.”\n“You should.” The lion tossed the dice and brought up four and six, to\nfalse delight from the girls about the table. “Married myself not long ago.\nHad my doubts but it’s been the best decision of my life.” The bird winced\nand turned away. “Haven’t looked back.”\n“She’s licked you into shape!” The unicorn blew a little bubble of snot\nas he laughed.\n“I suppose it all depends on finding the right woman.” Orso gave a long\nsigh. “Thought I had her. But she slipped through my fingers somehow.”\n“You should work on your grip.” The lion tossed the dice one more time.\n“Pair of sixes,” droned the dealer, and swept an armload of chips over\nwhile the girls cooed as though throwing one number rather than another\nwas quite the achievement.\nNow the greeter whispered something in the lion’s ear and he stepped\naway from the table, straightening his jacket. “Best of luck with your\nbusiness. And with your mother.” He frowned over at his friends. “I’m sure\nyou three will keep busy while I’m gone.”\nThe whale grinned over at the bird. “I daresay we can think of\nsomething.”\n“Lovely,” muttered Tunny, out of the corner of his mouth, as he watched\nthe man stride away with the slightest limp.\n“Real charmer.” Orso scooped up the dice and tossed them bouncing\nacross the table.\n“One and three,” said the old dealer. “Player loses.” In much the same\nemotionless tone as he might have announced a win.\nOrso sighed as he watched the chips gathered up. “Why is it always the\nbastards who get all the luck?”\n“Winning teaches you nothing,” said Tunny. “You see what a man really\nis when he loses.”\nJappo mon Rogont Murcatto—Grand Duke of Ospria and Visserine,\nProtector of Puranti, Nicante, Borletta and Affoia, not to mention King of\nStyria—sprawled on a velvet chaise in front of a mural of winged women\nfloating naked from a sunset sky and looked very pleased about it.

His\nSuljuk silk gown trailed open to show his muscular stomach, complete with\na streak of thick black hair.\nA young man dressed in the style of a Gurkish slave-boy had been\nleaning close to light the king’s pipe. Now he swaggered over to Leo,\nsinewy body dusted with glitter. “Can I get you anything? Anything at all?”\n“No!” snapped Leo. King Jappo’s preferences were well known, but\nhe’d never dreamed they’d be so proudly displayed. Leo had always\npreferred the company of men, but not in this way. Not at all in this way.\nHe certainly wouldn’t have boasted about it, if he’d been a pervert. Which\nhe wasn’t, of course. He just… found it hard to get excited unless his wife\nslapped him.\n“Thank you for seeing me,” he managed to grate out.\n“I was here anyway.” Jappo sprawled back and puffed brown smoke\nrings. “You’re the one who’s crossed a sea.”\nNot the best start. “It was my wife’s idea. Like most of my good ones.”\nYes, keep it light. Charm the bastard, like Jurand had said.\n“Alas, I have not met your wife, but by all accounts she’s a very shrewd\nwoman.” Jappo shook his fist. “Very tough.” He stroked his shining gown.\n“Very beautiful. I love to surround myself with beautiful things. But\nwomen?” He held up a wobbling hand and made a sound like nyeh. “Mixed\nfeelings. Hope you’re enjoying Cardotti’s.”\n“Well—”\n“No doubt you prefer the battlefield!” Jappo swung his bare feet down\nand sat eagerly forward, hacking at the air with his still-smoking pipe. “You\nwant to mount a horse rather than a lover, grip an axe instead of a bottle and\nhave the screams of the dying for music! Am I right, Young Lion? Eh? Eh?”\n“Well—”\n“Chagga?”\n“I like to keep a clear head.”\n“I like mine stuffed with delicious dreams.” And Jappo stuck the pipe\nback between his teeth and puffed away. “Come sit.” And he patted the\nchaise beside him.\nLeo pointedly took a chair opposite. By the dead, he wished he hadn’t\nturned down those drinks now. He couldn’t have been less comfortable. But\na man shows his quality when circumstances are against him, his father\nalways used to say. Where was the glory in easy victories?\n“So tell me, Young Lion, why did your wife send you here?”\n“She didn’t send me…” Had she, though? “I mean—”\n“Your wife told her friends who told my friends who told me that you’re\nbuilding a grand alliance! That if I were to hop aboard we could drag\nrelations between Styria and the Union out of the bog. That after so many\nunprofitable wars we could forge a peace that would be the envy of the\nworld.” Jappo grinned over. “Anything to it?”\n“Well…” Leo struggled to force his mind back onto the script. “The\nonly real dispute we have is King Orso’s claim on Talins. His false claim,\nthat is—”\n“I think it’s quite a solid claim.”\n“What?”"

His false claim,\nthat is—”\n“I think it’s quite a solid claim.”\n“What?”\n“His grandfather was Grand Duke of Talins, then my mother murdered\nhim and his sons and stole the city. My lawyers would no doubt differ, but if\nyou’re asking me, Orso has a much better claim to the city than I do. But\nthen I have it, and I’m not handing it over, and every time the Union tries to\ntake it from me, my mother gives you quite the spanking. So when it comes\nto claims…” And he twisted his face and made that nyeh sound again.\n“Well… yes. I’m saying we wouldn’t try again. We’d give up the claim.\nI’m not interested in Talins. Only the Union.”\n“Indeed.” Jappo’s expression was hard to gauge because of the mask.\n“The Union interests you so much, you want to steal it.”\nLeo worked his mouth. “I want to free it.”\n“I once heard a pickpocket use that defence about some purses he’d\nliberated. They still cut his hands off.”\n“Our quarrel’s not with King Orso, but with his Closed Council. Their\narrogance. Their corruption. They’re dragging the nation into the sewer!”\n“And who is involved in this noble scheme to free the Union from its\nking’s chosen councillors?”\nLeo paused a moment, mouth half-open.\n“Come, come, Young Lion. You can’t expect me to join a club without\nknowing the quality of the other members.”\nProbably Leo should have kept his cards close, but the man’s constant\nlook of slight scorn was beginning to grate on him.\n“Myself and all the Lords of Angland. Lord Isher, Lord Heugen, Lord\nBarezin and fifteen other chairs of the Open Council, though I’m sure more\nwill join us, they’re all chafing under the Closed Council’s yoke—”\n“A little olive oil can help.”\n“What?”\n“With chafing.”\nLeo soldiered on. “Then we have friends among the commoners, and the\nsworn oath of the King of the Northmen himself, Stour Nightfall.”\n“A far-reaching brotherhood! Can King Orso really know nothing about\nit?”\nThere was no point holding back now. It was all or nothing. And\nboldness had always been Leo’s way.\n“He doesn’t suspect a thing.” Leo was trying so hard not to look at\nJappo’s bare stomach, he ended up constantly glancing at it. “A member of\nhis Closed Council is in our pocket, warning us of every move he makes.”\n“And expecting a reward, I’m sure. No doubt every one of your allies\nhas something to gain?” If he could’ve seen Jappo’s eyebrows, Leo\nexpected they would’ve been raised expectantly.\n“I can offer you Sipani.” Dismal negotiating. He was tossing away cities\nwithout even a hint of barter. Savine would’ve been disgusted.\n“That’s generous.”\n“I’m a soldier, not a salesman.”\n“I meant I was unaware it was yours to give. Here I am, after all, in\nSipani, enjoying the best the city has to offer without your permission.\nDoing what I want. Smoking what I want. Fucking who I want.”"

Fucking who I want.”\n“Your bed, your business,” snapped Leo, but the Styrian proverb came\nout strangled.\n“If it helps, I don’t only fuck men.” As far as could be told through his\nmask, King Jappo looked faintly amused. “Sometimes I’m fucked by them.\nLook at it this way—if you needed advice on horses, you wouldn’t go to\nsomeone who never rode a horse.”\n“What?”\n“How could someone who never had a cock really know what’s best to\ndo with a cock? I’ve debated scholars the world over and no one’s been able\nto give me a satisfactory answer on that point.”\n“Some might say there’s a natural order to things,” Leo forced through\ngritted teeth.\n“If we were constrained by the natural order we would still be wriggling\nnaked in the filth.”\n“Some of us still are,” said Leo, before he could stop himself.\nJappo only gave a little snort of laughter. “So Sipani is your final offer?”\nLeo paused. They’d all agreed to offer Westport, if they had to. A\nsuperstitious slum, Savine had said. A paltry price to pay for Angland,\nStarikland and Midderland. He’d reluctantly agreed at the time, but now his\nleg was aching, and perhaps it was the chagga smoke, but he was feeling\nout of sorts, hot in the face and slightly dizzy. He hated Styria, hated Sipani,\nhated Cardotti’s, hated this degenerate excuse for a king most of all. He\nraised his chin, trying to look haughtily down his nose, but his eyes kept\nbeing drawn to that trail of dark hair from Jappo’s navel into the not entirely\nconcealing shadows of his gown…\n“My last offer!” he snapped, angrily.\nJappo gave a wounded pout. “Your shrewd, tough, beautiful wife gave\nyou nothing else to bargain with?”\n“You’re dealing with me!” growled Leo, further nettled. He wasn’t\ngiving up Union territory to one of the Union’s enemies, especially not this\none. Savine might be upset but he was the husband, the leader, the lord and\nmaster. He was the Young Lion. He’d beaten Stour Nightfall. He’d beaten\nBlack Calder. He could beat the likes of bloody Orso without the help of\nsome grinning Styrian pervert.\n“Shame,” murmured Jappo, though whether he was talking about the\noffer, or who was making it, was hard to tell. “You’ve given me a lot to\nthink about.” He lay back, one arm behind his head, forcing Leo to\nscrupulously keep his eyes away as that bloody gown fell even further open.\n“Less than I was hoping, but even so. I’ll let you know my answer in due\ncourse.”\n“Sooner rather than later,” said Leo stiffly. “We move on the last day of\nsummer.”\n“Stay a while, Young Lion. Enjoy the hospitality. You seem tense.

He would’ve liked to\nfling the bastard thing closed and snarl some ugly curses after it, but the\ngreeter was in the hallway, guiding someone else towards Jappo’s door. It\nwas that smug idiot from downstairs with a gilded sun for a mask.\n“Mind out,” he snarled, barging past.\n“By all means,” said Orso as the man in the lion mask shoved between him\nand the greeter and stomped away. “Rather rude.”\n“It was,” said the greeter.\n“But being an arsehole is crime and punishment both.”\n“It is.” And she eased the door open and offered him the way.\n“King Orso!” Jappo Murcatto reclined on a velvet daybed in a mask\nsculpted like spread eagle’s wings and a Gurkish robe that left nothing to\nthe imagination. “It is a great pleasure to make your acquaintance!”\n“The pleasure is mine,” said Orso, in Styrian, giving the kind of\nsweeping bow his mother had always told him was popular in Talins. “How\noften, after all, do two kings get to chat? It’s rather refreshing, being able to\nspeak to someone on an equal footing.” And he took his mask off and\ntossed it on a side table, then dropped down in a chair and poured himself a\nglass of wine.\nJappo frowned at the mask. “That’s really not the done thing in\nCardotti’s.”\n“We’re kings. The done thing is whatever we do. I came here for a frank\ndiscussion. By all means leave yours on, if you prefer.”\n“You speak excellent Styrian.”\n“I have my mother to thank. She won’t bully me in any other tongue.”\n“We both owe our mothers a debt, then. Mine gave me a whole\nkingdom.” And Jappo plucked his mask off and dropped it beside Orso’s.\nHis face was not at all what Orso had imagined. Handsome, but in a strong-\nboned, broad-jawed sort of way. Surprisingly pale, too, in spite of his dark\ncurls. He looked more like a Northman than a Styrian.\n“Chagga?” he asked, holding up a pipe.\n“Whyever not?”\nWhile the King of Styria charged the pipe, the King of the Union\nfrowned up at the towering mural behind him. “A copy of Aropella’s\nFates?”\n“Well recognised!” Jappo turned to look it over. “Worse brushwork than\nthe great man’s version but far more bare flesh, so I consider it a draw. The\noriginal’s in my mother’s palace at Fontezarmo.”\n“I am aware. My mother would say it’s her palace, though.”\n“Really?”\n“And that Aropella’s Fates is one of the few treasures your mother\ndidn’t destroy when she stole the place. Mostly because, as it’s on the\nceiling, it was out of easy reach of the criminal scum she’d employed to\nhelp her.”\n“And do you share your mother’s opinion?”\n“Very rarely,” said Orso. “She tends towards the vengeful. I sometimes\nthink she named me purely with the intention of annoying your mother. My\nnamesake Grand Duke Orso did kill your uncle, after all, and very nearly"

We do have a\nrather… complicated family situation.”\n“Most kings do, I suppose.”\n“Honestly, I’d rather put it all behind me. What’s the point in having\nnew generations if all we do is pick up the feuds of the old one?”\n“I’m very glad to hear you say that.” Jappo discerningly pursed his lips\nas he plucked the hood off a lamp and held it to his pipe, puffing up a smog\nof brown smoke. “Enemies are like furniture, aren’t they? Better chosen for\noneself than inherited.”\n“And made to be sat on.”\n“My mother would agree with you there. She is a soldier.” Jappo tossed\nhis head with a kind of fierce pride when he said it. Perhaps the first truly\nhonest-seeming thing he’d done since Orso arrived. He handed the pipe\nover. “A most formidable one.”\n“Perhaps the most formidable alive,” said Orso, puffing some smoke of\nhis own. “Only an idiot would deny it.”\n“But great soldiers become prisoners of their own success. All she thinks\nof is her next victory. Beating her enemies. Winning the war. She pays no\nmind to making friends. She has no time to win the peace.”\n“And is that what you want? To win the peace?”\nJappo shrugged. “Here in Styria we had the Years of Blood, then the\nYears of Fire. There in the Union you had two wars with the Gurkish and\ntwo wars against the North. Then, to cap it off, we fought three wars against\neach other. Half a century of destruction. No one is asking me, but if they\nwere, I would say that we could probably take a breath. Build something!\nMake the world better!” He seemed to remember himself and sat back.\n“And, you know, fuck. Make music.”\n“Mmmm.” Orso blew a couple of ragged smoke rings. “This dissolute\nhedonist business suits you, but I’ve played the role myself.”\n“Really?”\n“My own preference tilts towards women—”\n“As does your mother’s, I understand?”\n“As does my mother’s—she has sublime taste in that as in so much else\n—but otherwise all this is rather like looking in the mirror. I think I even\nhad that same gown.” He pointed at it with the stem of the pipe. “Though\nsadly not that stomach. So I am well aware—fun though it is—this\nperformance is just another kind of mask.”\nJappo raised his brows. “You’d like me to take that one off, too, would\nyou?”\n“I wouldn’t ask you to strip too far for your comfort, but I think we have\nthe best chance of a mutually beneficial discussion without it.”\nA little smile curled the corner of Jappo’s mouth, and he jerked his gown\nclosed, swung his long legs from the chaise and sat forward. “Then let’s talk\nhonestly!”"

He\nwasn’t even sure how he’d ended up backstairs. Took a wrong turn\nsomewhere. When he left Angland to ask for Styrian support, in his opinion.\nThere was nothing you could trust in the whole damn country.\nBehind the veneer, Cardotti’s House of Leisure was a very different\nplace. A warren of low-ceilinged little cells, mouldy, cheap and seething\nwith frantic action. It reminded Leo of the preparations for a battle. The\nchaos and barely contained panic, the pulling on of gear and tightening of\nstraps, the expressions of grim determination.\nHe glimpsed two women through a doorway, one with teeth gritted and\nchin raised, mask dangling from her hand. “He fucking bit me, the bastard!”\nshe snarled in common. “He fucking bit me! Is it bleeding?”\n“A little,” said the other as she dabbed at red marks on her neck with a\ncloth. “You shouldn’t be back here!” she snarled at Leo, kicking the door\nclosed.\nHis meeting with Jappo had gone badly, he knew. Worse the more he\nthought about it. He wondered whether he might’ve made a serious mistake\nby not offering more. Then he felt disgusted with himself for offering as\nmuch as he had, annoyed with Savine for making him try, irritated at the\nworld and everything in it. He’d made a grubby compromise too far by\neven talking to that greasy bastard and hadn’t gained a thing. What use\ncould a man like that be in a battle anyway? If you could even call him a\nman. Once Leo had dealt with the Closed Council, he’d have to lead an\narmy to Styria so Union arms could finally wipe the smirk from King\nJappo’s face.\nThe thought gave him some fleeting satisfaction, but it was soon driven\noff by the pain in his thigh. He leaned against the wall to grip it, knead it,\nbreathing hard through clenched teeth. He wished he’d brought his cane\nnow, but he refused to look like a cripple. A band was tuning up\nsomewhere, a flurry of screeching notes.\nHe saw a woman up on her elbows on a bench, skirts around her hips\nwhile an old man in cracked eye-lenses peered between her legs. “You’ve\ncaught the rot,” he explained to her in Northern. “You’ll need to use a\npowder twice a day. Don’t eat it!”\n“Why the hell would I eat it?” she snapped.\nLeo recoiled from a blast of steam.

Or, well… the King of the Northmen hurt it. Hasn’t healed. Don’t\nknow if it ever will.”\nShe looked up at him with that awfully solemn look children sometimes\nhave. “Do you know where my mother is?”\n“I’m afraid… I expect she’s probably working.” Leo cleared his throat,\nnot knowing what the hell to do with her and deciding nothing was his best\nbet. Somewhere a female voice screeched furiously in Styrian, an endless\nflow of sing-song curses. “Do you know where the gaming hall is?”\nThe girl raised her skinny arm to point at a narrow door further down the\nhallway. “Up the stairs.”\nWhen Leo finally found the place, Antaup was lolling against the dice\ntable looking even more drunk than before. “You’re back!” he called, tried\nto let go of the table and nearly fell.\nLeo caught him by the elbow. “Where the hell is everyone?”\n“Think Glaward an’ Jurand went back to the rooms… maybe… said we\nshould stay. Enjoy selves. Jin, is he with that woman still? Shall we get a\ndrink?”\n“I think you’ve had enough,” said Leo, giving Antaup a shake. “Jin can\nfind his own way back.” He couldn’t stand to spend another moment in this\nplace. He needed to talk to someone clear-headed. Someone clever, who\ncould work out how big a mistake he’d made. He needed Jurand. “Let’s\ngo.”\nKing Jappo filled Orso’s glass, then tapped a loose drop from the edge of\nthe decanter. “So what has brought you all the way across the Circle Sea?”\n“Treason,” said Orso, simply. “I may be facing a rather serious rebellion,\nand these rebels may be seeking your help. I want to convince you not to\ngive it.”\n“You are frank.”\n“I expect your position, like mine, gives you limited time to relax. I\nwould not presume to take up more of it than necessary.”\n“How thoughtful.”\n“Good manners are a gift that costs nothing.”\n“If only the Young Lion saw things that way.”\nOrso paused. Plainly that had been no slip of the tongue. “You have…\nmet with Lord Brock, then?” It was a heavy blow, but hardly a surprising\none. Orso wondered whether Savine knew of it. Whether she had helped\nplan it. Even now, the thought gave him a stab of pain so sharp he could\nbarely hide it.\n“Perhaps I have been approached about joining a… let us call it a\nconfederation. Conspiracy strikes an ugly note, doesn’t it?”\n“Awfully tasteless,” said Orso, sucking thoughtfully on the pipe and\nletting the smoke curl away.\n“A confederation based on freedom, patriotism and high principles.”\n“Awfully tasteful.”\n“Aimed at… let us say… altering the priorities and personnel of the\nUnion government.”"

How could anyone? I could lie and\nsay yes, then later renege, but I think we’ve all had enough of that sort of\nbehaviour. I would rather be honest and say the best you’ll get from me is\nthat things stay comfortably familiar. I will give up my claims on Talins.\nI’ve only ever seen the place in paintings. Take it with my blessing. Perhaps\nin time we can even join hands across the Circle Sea and win the peace\ntogether.” He looked up at Jappo and let his smile fade. “But if you try to\ntake Sipani, I will fight you. I may well lose. But I will fight you. With\neverything I have.”\nThere was a lengthy silence. Then Jappo raised one long forefinger and\nwagged it at him. “I thought I’d love the Young Lion and find you\ndetestable.”\n“You would hardly be alone with that opinion.”\nJappo slapped his thigh. “That’s what I mean! You’re excellent value,\nand he’s a fucking idiot! Warriors, I swear.”\n“I know. They’re so ridiculous, and yet they have no sense of humour.”\n“Fuck him.” And Jappo handed back the pipe. “Sipani isn’t worth\nanother meeting with that arrogant arsehole. And from what I’ve heard,\nStour Nightfall wouldn’t know the difference between Aropella’s Fates and\na smacked arse. I very much doubt he and I would get on.”\n“He was one of these patriots, then?”\n“Along, I believe, with at least a dozen members of your Open Council\nand at least one of your Closed.”\n“I don’t suppose you’d fancy sharing some names?”\n“I wouldn’t want to spoil the game. You’ve played so well so far.”\nOrso sat back, smiling. It was bad. It was as bad as he had feared. But\nthere was a strange relief in knowing exactly how bad. “You know, King\nJappo, I think we should make this a regular thing.”\n“I’m amenable, King Orso. Once you’ve beaten your rebels. If you beat\nthem.”\n“So I can rely on you to stay out of this?”\n“My mother would want me to promise you yes.” Jappo grinned very\nwide. “Then stab you in the back at the first opportunity.”"

Sounds of the city outside. Music and laughter.\nGilt mouldings gleamed in the darkness, drapes stirred about the open\nwindow. That made him frown. Surely they’d shut it? Could someone have\nbroken in? Be waiting for them? It only came to him then how dangerous\nthis business might be. How many enemies he’d made. They should never\nhave split up! He put a hand on the hilt of his sword.\n“Glaward!” he hissed, wincing as he stepped into the room. After the\nwalk back, his leg was burning all the way from his foot to his hip, he could\nhardly bend the knee.\nAntaup started giggling, which didn’t help. He’d been giggling all the\nway from bloody Cardotti’s. “Pour me a drink, eh—”\n“Shush!” Leo caught him by the elbow and half-steered, half-threw him\ninto a chair.\nHe sat there, shaking with suppressed laughter which, within a few\nbreaths, turned to gentle snoring.\n“By the dead,” muttered Leo. Then he saw a chink of light at the\nkeyhole of one of the connecting doors. Jurand’s and Glaward’s masks\ndangled on the knob beside it. Whale and bird. A flood of relief. He let go of\nhis sword, went to the door and shoved it wide. “There you are—”\nHe thought at first that they were wrestling, and nearly laughed at the\nmismatch.\nThey were kneeling on the Gurkish carpet, Glaward gripping two fistfuls\nof the covers which he’d half-dragged from the bed, eyes squeezed shut and\nhis mouth open. Jurand was pressed against his back with his teeth bared,\none hand down between Glaward’s legs, the other tangled in his hair and\ntwisting his head around so he could bite at his ear.\nThen Leo realised Jurand had his trousers down around his ankles and\nGlaward had his off completely, flung rumpled into a corner, their hairy\nthighs pressed together, and suddenly it was entirely clear what they were\ndoing, and it wasn’t wrestling.\n“But…” he breathed, clapping a hand over his face, but somehow still\nlooking through the gap between his fingers. “Fuck!”\nHe reeled away, nearly tripped over Antaup’s outstretched boot and\nstumbled from the room, out into the corridor, leg burning, face burning. He\nwas sickened, shamed, disgusted. Wasn’t he?\n“Leo!” Jurand’s voice echoed at him from behind and Leo flinched, kept\nlurching on, didn’t look back."

Gunnar Broad, in my back parlour.”\nHe knew that voice right off, and what he thought was, Fuck. What he\nsaid was, “Hello, Judge.”\n“Told you he’d be back, eh, Sarlby?” One of those blurs drifted towards\nhim. “Some men just can’t help ’emselves.” Someone perched his lenses on\nhis nose, nudged them into that familiar groove and, like magic, everything\nbecame clear. Might’ve been better if it hadn’t.\nJudge grinned down at him, Sarlby and a few others of his ilk standing\naround the stained walls of a cellar with not a friendly eye among ’em.\nTime hadn’t improved her. She still wore that rusted breastplate over a\nragged ballgown looked like it belonged to a baroness chased through a\nbriar patch. Her red hair was an even madder tangle, gathered up like some\nparrot’s crest on top and clipped to patchy stubble at the sides. She still was\ndecked with jewels, chains of office and strings of pearls ripped from the\nrich of Valbeck in the uprising. But, as if she needed to look more like\nbloodshed personified, she’d strapped herself up with belts and bandoliers,\ntoo, knives dangling from them, hatchets tucked into them, blades enough\nto run a chain of butchers.\nShe’d made him nervous the first time he laid eyes on her, and being\nchained to a chair in her presence helped not one bit. Made him think of all\nthe dead folk she’d left hanged in the yard behind the ruined courthouse. He\ncould still hear the sound of it, like a ship’s rigging, creaking with the\nbreeze.\nHe’d been hoping for Risinau. That would’ve been worrying enough.\nJudge was ten times worse. Worse ’cause she was far more clever and far\nmore dangerous. Worse ’cause if she was in charge, reason was out the\nwindow and running for the hills. Worse ’cause the moment he saw her, he\nfelt that guilty tickle, deep inside. The same one he got when he felt\nviolence coming.\nShe leaned down over him, reached out and smoothed his hair with one\nring-encrusted hand like a mother might smooth a wayward son’s. It was\nthe best he could do not to twist away. Twist away, or maybe twist closer.\n“You know how sometimes…” she purred, “you see an old lover you\nhaven’t seen in years… and you get that tingle in the crotch.” He knew\nwhat a tingle in the crotch felt like, all right, he had one now. “And you\nthink to yourself… why aren’t we still together? How could something so\nsweet have turned so sour?”\n“Might be all the hangin’s,” tossed out Sarlby from the corner of the\nroom."

That’s\nmy tragedy.” She snapped her fingers and one of the men slapped a bottle of\nspirits into her hand. “But you do, don’t you, Bull Broad? I knew it when\nyou flung that man o’ mine across my courtroom and smashed his head\nthrough a witness box. You see what needs to be done.”\nAnd she curled her tongue around the neck of the bottle and drank,\nblotchy throat shifting with each hard swallow. She caught Broad watching\nand grinned as she smacked her lips. Gave the bottle a shake, that lovely\ntinkle of spirits sloshing inside.\n“Want a drink?”\n“No,” he said, wanting one worse than just about anything and not\nhiding it well.\n“You sure? ’Cause I’m getting the feeling there’s something over here\nyou like the look of.”\nBroad watched, caught somewhere between terrified and fascinated as\nshe reached down, took the hem of her tattered skirts and pulled it up, up to\nshow the writing tattooed around and around her thigh, long-winded quotes\nfrom some political treatise or other, and she slipped that leg over his and\nstraddled him, knives and chains scraping against her breastplate as she\nperched herself on his lap.\n“Sarlby tells me you want to talk to the Breakers,” she said.\nBroad tried to tell himself Judge on top of him was the last thing in the\nworld he’d want. That he was in more danger here than he’d been climbing\na ladder onto the walls of Musselia, crowded with enemies. That she\ndisgusted him.\nHe wasn’t sure who he was fooling.\n“Shame is, the Breakers melted away like snow in spring,” said Judge.\n“Those they didn’t hang, like your friend Sarlby here…” and she tossed him\nthe bottle, “have seen the light of the fire. Seen the folly of half-measures.\nRisinau’s off down in Keln or some such fancy place, preaching his blather\nto the wide-eyed and wishful. But those of us still in Valbeck.” She leaned\nclose, breath hot on his face. “We’re all Burners now.”\nBroad tried to keep Liddy and May in his mind. It was them he was\ndoing this for. Had to keep a grip on himself. But it wasn’t easy with\nJudge’s crotch pressing up against his half-hard prick and the reek of spirits\nso strong on her breath it was making his head spin.\n“Breakers or Burners,” croaked Broad, “makes no difference.”\n“Suppose it wouldn’t to you.” She gave a long sniff. “I hear you’ve\ncrossed the lines.”\n“Gone to serve the owners,” grunted Sarlby.\n“And not just any owner, but the queen bee herself! The fruit of Old\nSticks’ own withered loins, Savine dan fucking Glokta!”\n“Dan Brock,” muttered Broad.\nJudge smiled. Or at any rate showed her teeth. “Don’t try and trick a\ntrickster.

The owners chisel our pay every unjust\nway they can and call it an honest wage. The Closed Council drafts a set of\nrules that make the rich richer and drive the poor to starve and call it an\nequality law. You know what they named the most low-lying, smog-\nchoking, shit-stinking alley of rotten cellars in all of Valbeck?” She leaned a\nlittle closer to whisper it. “Primrose Heights. Calling a thing a different\nthing don’t make it a different thing, now does it?”\n“Wouldn’t know,” croaked Broad, who beat men for a living and called\nit labour relations, “I’m no philosopher.”\n“Just a traitor.” She barked the word, and suddenly she was standing\nover him with her black eyes blazing, a handful of his shirt clutched in one\ntrembling fist and a cleaver drawn in the other. She pressed that cold metal\ninto his neck, twisting him back in the chair, and the men around the cellar\nshifted and nodded and grunted their anger.\n“I’m one o’ you,” growled Broad, trying to scrape together as much\ndignity as he could with his life hanging from a thread and a badly spun one\nat that. “I fought the good fight here. Stood on the barricades. Stayed to the\nbitter end. Chance might’ve landed us in different places, but we want the\nsame thing. Food for our families. A safe place for ’em to sleep. An honest\nwage for honest work.” All the old slogans, puked up like he still believed\nthem. “Malmer was my friend. I was angry as anyone when they hanged\nhim. But the Young Lion had no part o’ that. He wants to fight the Closed\nCouncil like he fought the Northmen—”\nHe winced as Judge pressed that cleaver harder into his neck, right on\nthe point of drawing blood, chair legs grinding as she started to tip him\nbackwards. “Is that a fact?”\n“It is.” Broad’s voice had a scared squeak to it. Or was it an excited one?\nHe had to keep a grip on himself. “The whole army of Angland. On the last\nday of summer, they’ll land on the coast of Midderland. Thousands of Stour\nNightfall’s warriors, too. They’ll join up with the noblemen and they’ll\nmarch on Adua.”\n“Rebellion against Old Sticks and his Closed Council. Against His\nfucking Majesty?” The cold metal was of a sudden whipped away and\nJudge stood, letting Broad’s chair lurch forward onto its front legs. She\ngave a shiver all over, chains and knives rattling. “I got chills, Sarlby. You\ngot chills?”\n“I got lice,” said Sarlby.\n“Who hasn’t? Well, apart from Savine dan fucking Brock. Daresay that\nbitch shits soap and pisses perfume.” Judge narrowed her eyes to black slits,\nwith a gleam of flame at the corners. It was hard to look into them. Hard to\nlook away. “So she wants us to rise up, does she? Keep the king’s soldiers"

Am I close to it?”\nBroad glanced around at the men. “You’re Burners, no? I thought rising\nup was what you’re all about. You’ll get no better chance than this.”\nCouple of them looked like they were buying it, but Judge only sneered.\n“Let’s say it all goes your way, and the Young Lion tears the Closed\nCouncil down and buries his wife’s father and all the other vultures, what\nthen?” She poked him in the gut with her cleaver, made him wince. “It’s the\nnobles backing him. The owners still. We’ll have done nothing but swapped\none set of users for another!”\n“You’ll get a say in how things are done. Might not be a Great Change,\nbut it’ll be a change for the better. The Brocks have done some good up in\nAngland. Limits on workers’ hours. Rules to keep gears and driveshafts\nsafe. Controls on truck shops and overseers’ penalties. All sorts o’ things the\nBreakers been after for years.”\n“That’s true,” said Sarlby. “I heard about that.”\nSome of the others mumbled agreement. “Aye, my cousin’s got a place\nin a mine, he’s working three hours less a day.”\nOne even went so far as to mutter, “They call her the Darling o’ the\nSlums—”\n“Do me a fucking favour!” Judge leaned down snarling over Broad\nagain, lamplight gleaming on the edge of her raised cleaver. “You must take\nme for some new kind o’ fool.”\n“No one’s saying they’re your friends!” Trying to stay calm in spite of\nhis thudding heart. “But they’re the next best thing. Your enemies’\nenemies.” Broad tried to smile. The way Savine smiled, like she held all the\ncards however bad things looked. Probably didn’t work too well chained to\na chair, but he tried. “Come to the docks. See what I brought with me. Then\nyou can be… the judge.”\n“Oh, I like that.” She smiled, switched back in an instant from fury to\noily desire, and she settled herself in Broad’s lap again, closer than ever,\nmaking him grunt through gritted teeth. “I expected fisticuffs from you, but\nnever wordplay.” He could hardly think for the horrible, beautiful reek of\nspirits on her breath. “Did you bring me a present?” Had to keep a grip on\nhimself. Had to. “How romantic.”\nThere was a squeal of complaining wood as Bannerman wrenched the crate\nopen. The Burners clustered close, staring down eager as winter tramps\naround a brazier.\nSwords glittered inside. A neat row of brand-new swords, all the same,\nwith a long, straight, single-edged blade and a dull steel grip, fresh oiled\nfrom the foundry.\n“Two-score infantry swords.” Bannerman pulled one from the crate with\na practised flourish and displayed it to Judge. “Latest pattern.

Two-score breastplates and two-score helms. All best\nAngland steel.”\nAnother crate screeched as Halder ripped the lid off. He pulled out a\nflatbow, sleek and deadly looking, even the frame made of metal, bored\nthrough with slots to make it lighter.\n“Latest design with the new Wearing crank,” said Halder. “A dressmaker\ncould draw it and it’ll still pierce the heaviest armour.” He tossed the bow\nacross to Sarlby and he snatched it from the air, twisted it over, rattled the\ntrigger, seeming to stand a little straighter with a weapon in his hand.\n“Good?” asked Judge.\n“Good,” said Sarlby, holding the flatbow to his eye and sighting down it,\nthen slowly starting to smile. “Very good.”\n“Then there’s this.” Broad ripped the top from the biggest case, dragging\na fistful of wood-shavings out of the way. Dull metal shone underneath. A\ngreat dark, tapering tube three strides long, and stamped into it: Armoury of\nOstenhorm, 606.\n“What’s this?” whispered Judge. “You’ve got a fucking thunder pipe?”\n“No. You’ve got one. The newest kind. Can throw a solid ball a mile or\nturn a few handfuls of ironware into a rain of death. They’ve taken to\ncalling ’em cannons,” said Broad. “From some Styrian word, I hear. But\nwhatever you call it, it comes to the same thing.” He leaned close to\nwhisper in her ear. “Lightning in your pocket.”\n“Never saw such a beautiful thing.” Judge stroked that metal with her\nfingertips, up and down with a steady swish, swish, and Broad felt that sick\ntickle stronger than ever, not sure whether it was Judge or the weapons or\nsome combination of the two that dried his mouth out so.\nMade him wonder, for a moment, what she might do with all this\nmachine-sharpened steel. She who’d killed dozens in Valbeck with just a bit\nof rope? He told himself all he was doing was taking a thing from here to\nthere on the orders of his mistress. Wasn’t his concern what folk chose to do\nwith it after. A tale traders in weapons been telling themselves since\nweapons first were made, no doubt.\nJudge’s black eyes rolled across to him, gleaming wetly in the echoing\ngloom of the warehouse. “Well, I don’t think I was ever brought nicer\npresents, Gunnar Broad. I thought nothing could warm me to Savine dan\nBrock, but she’s managed to light a fire in my quim even so. Perhaps she\nreally will be the Darling of the Slums in the end.”\n“And this is just a taste,” said Broad.\n“Just slipping me the tip, eh, you fucking tease?”\n“I tell the Brocks we’ve got a deal, there’s a full shipload waiting on the"

They’re\nbeing brought into Valbeck for a show trial and summary execution.\nTomorrow night, is it, Sarlby?”\n“Tomorrow night,” said Sarlby, holding a vicious-looking flatbow bolt\nup to the light.\n“We’re going to free those good people.”\n“And you want me to help?”\n“You want you to help. Admit it. You can’t wait to get your hands\nbloody.”\nBroad swallowed. He should’ve known words weren’t going to get this\ndone. “They’ll be guarded.”\n“Heavily,” said Judge, the axe whistling faintly as she swung it back and\nforth.\n“And the guards’ll be expecting trouble.”\nJudge nodded towards the cannon. “Not this much.”\n“Men’ll die.”\n“Ain’t much worth doing don’t involve a few dead men.” She tossed the\naxe over to him and he caught it by its metal shaft. “That a point against the\nplan, in your mind, or in favour?”\nBroad frowned as he weighed the axe in his hand. Truth was he wasn’t\nsure.\nChanges at the Top\n“I\nt seems our letter-writer may have been a friend after all,” said Orso.\n“Or at least an honest enemy.

Crushing news, especially for him, but\nOrso could have sworn he saw a wry smile at the corner of the old\nInquisitor’s mouth. “Body found floating by the docks,” he murmured.\n“Sorry?”\nGlokta took a sharp breath and snapped his eyes open. “I must resign at\nonce.”\n“Your Eminence, I need your advice more than ever—”\n“But we both know you cannot have it.” Glokta looked down at his\nwhite-gloved fist, clenched on the desktop. “When you have clung to power\nas tightly as I have, it can be difficult to let go.” He spread his fingers out\nflat, the purple stone on his ring of office glittering. “But the time has come.\nMy son-in-law may very well be a traitor.” He curled his lips back from his\nruined teeth. “Even… my daughter.”\n“But—”\n“Superior Pike!” shrieked Glokta, so piercingly Orso was obliged to\nnarrow his eyes as Pike walked in, black coat flapping.\n“For twenty-five years, Superior Pike has been my right hand,” said\nGlokta. “No one has more experience or better judgement. No one\nunderstands so well what must be done. I suggest he serves as head of the\nInquisition until you appoint a new Arch Lector.”\nOrso glanced up at Pike’s melted mask of a face. He would have liked to\nchoose someone else. Someone softer, gentler, more just. He remembered\nthe hanging of the prisoners at Valbeck. Remembered Pike gazing up\nunfeelingly at Malmer’s gibbet. He had proved himself ruthless and\nremorseless. A man feared and hated by all the Crown’s enemies, and most\nof its friends.\nThe very qualities a king needs in an Arch Lector.\n“I see no reason not to make the appointment permanent,” said Orso.\nPerhaps Bayaz would have other ideas when he next visited, but for now\nthe little people would have to make their own mistakes.\nPike solemnly inclined his head. “I serve and obey, Your Majesty.”\nOrso had never liked Glokta. He was not really a man it was possible to\nlike. But he had come to respect him. To rely upon him, even. And now,\nwhen Orso most needed support, he would be gone. “What will you do?”\nGlokta’s brows went up, as though the question had never occurred\nbefore. “Move to the country? Pin butterflies to a board? Argue with my\nwife? I always wanted to write a book about fencing.”\n“I… will look forward to reading it.” Though, in honesty, Orso had\nnever been much of a reader. “I, and the Union, thank you for your\ndistinguished service.”\nGlokta gave a little snort of laughter. “Only promise me one thing.\nShould you think me worthy of a statue on the Kingsway… have it stand\nup.” He waved a finger towards the Practical lurking behind him, and the\nman turned his wheeled chair towards the door.\nPike lowered his head. “Your Eminence.”"

The bare walls. The stark furniture. The heaps of unfinished\npaperwork. “I wish you both the very best of luck.”\nAnd as simply as that, it was done. No ceremony, no medals, no grand\nspeech and no cheering crowds. From the pinnacle of power to a toothless\nold cripple in one brief conversation. The chair squeaked from the room and\nthe doors were shut upon Sand dan Glokta. The era of Old Sticks was at an\nend.\nArch Lector Pike stepped behind the desk. There was no chair now, of\ncourse, and so he stood, spreading his burned hands out on the leather top\nand frowning down at the ring on his finger. It seemed Glokta had found the\none man even more monstrous than he as his replacement. But these were\ndesperate times. And in desperate times, one must sometimes call upon the\nservices of monsters.\n“How shall we proceed, Your Majesty?” asked Pike. “Softly, or…\notherwise?”\nOrso took a breath through his nose. “Could you send for Inquisitor\nTeufel? I have some ideas.”\nColonel Forest and Corporal Tunny were waiting outside the House of\nQuestions. Forest, typically, standing to attention in a modest uniform.\nTunny, typically, sprawling on a bench with a newsbill over his face.\n“Gentlemen,” said Orso. “Would you walk with me?” He felt an\nirrepressible need to stay busy, and the two old soldiers fell in on either side\nas he strode towards the palace, his retinue of Knights of the Body\nclattering after.\nFor twenty years, he could have done anything he wanted, and he had\ndone nothing. With his future blindingly bright, surrounded by comfort and\nbuoyed up by every privilege, getting out of bed had sometimes felt\nimpossible. Now, beset by enemies and with the gloomiest of outlooks, he\nfizzed with energy.\n“How many men do we have now?”\nForest kept his voice low. “Over four thousand, Your Majesty. Lot of\n’em served with the Crown Prince’s Division, keen to follow you again.”\n“Really?” Orso found that hard to believe.\n“You never pretended to be a general yourself, but you gave ’em pride.”\n“That’s… rather moving. Thank you.”\n“Their gear was gathering dust in the Agriont’s cellars in any case. It\nonly needed passing out again.”\nThere was an irony. Savine had paid for the weapons they would fight\nher husband with. “Where are you keeping them?”\n“Some in disused barracks outside the city. Some camped in woods and\nvalleys. Some still at their old jobs, waiting for the call. But they can be\ngathered quickly.”\nOrso smiled. Finally, a sunny spot in the darkness. “I knew you wouldn’t\nlet me down, General Forest.”\n“I’m a colonel, Your Majesty.”\n“If the High King of the Union says a man’s a general, who’s to deny it?"

        "text": "let me down, General Forest.”\n“I’m a colonel, Your Majesty.”\n“If the High King of the Union says a man’s a general, who’s to deny it?\nConsider yourself promoted.”\n“Look at that!” Tunny gave Forest a slovenly salute. “From enlisted man\nto general and it only took you forty years. You should get yourself a bigger\nhat.”\nForest pulled off his worn fur hat, revealing his sizeable bald patch, and\nfrowned down at it. “What’s wrong with my hat?”\n“It’s a fine, rugged, manly hat,” said Orso. “Don’t listen to him.”\n“Only looks a little bit like a quim,” said Tunny.\nOrso sternly shook his head. “Now, now, Corporal. Any more\ninsubordination and I’ll promote you.”\n“I’d sooner face the hangman.”\n“Oh, I daresay we’ll all be doing that.” And Orso found he had actually\ndelivered a carefree chuckle. They came out into the park, crunching down\na gravel path, shadows stretching across the dew-glittering lawns from the\nearly morning sun. Bloody hell, had he ever been up this early before?\nEverything was so crisp and clean and beautiful at this time of day. “It’s\nlooking likely that we’ll have to fight in the not too distant future.” And he\nslapped a hand down on Forest’s shoulder. “Can you gather more men?”\nThe newly minted general glanced cautiously about, but there were few\nprying ears. Those without rebellions to crush were still in bed. “I can, Your\nMajesty, if you can gather more money.”\n“Valint and Balk put no limit on my credit. Recruit as many as we can\narm, pick officers you trust and get them drilling. And secure whatever\nhorses you can lay your hands on, too, we may have to move quickly.”\n“Your Majesty.” Forest made to put his hat on, then stopped. “Bloody\nthing does look like a quim.” And he strode away.\n“Valint and Balk.” Tunny slowly shook his head. “They’ve got a ruthless\nreputation.”\n“A bank with a reputation for mercy is like a whore with a reputation for\nchastity—one fears they won’t get the job done. No doubt our conspirators\nare watching me, though. Too many visits to my financiers might arouse\nsuspicion. Which is why you’ll be my representative to the bank.”\nTunny was not an easy man to surprise. Orso found it rather gratifying\nwhen his jaw dropped. “I’ll be bloody what?”\n“The only real skill a king needs is to pick the best men to serve him.\nYou may like to paint yourself as the least dependable man in the Union,\nbut… I rather suspect it’s all a front. When it comes to it, I’m not sure\nthere’s a man in the Circle of the World I trust more.”\nTunny stared at him. “We’re all doomed.”\nThe old bureaucrats of the Closed Council looked wild-haired and flustered,\nand who could blame them? They had been dragged from their beds to an\nunscheduled meeting in which a fully armoured Knight of the Body loomed\nbehind each chair, even the empty chair of Bayaz, down at the foot of the\ntable. The White Chamber felt positively cramped by so much polished\nsteel."

The White Chamber felt positively cramped by so much polished\nsteel.\nOrso grimly steepled his fingers and frowned at each old face in turn.\nNone of them gave any immediate sign of being a conspirator. But then\nconspirators rarely do. Not the good ones, anyway. “My lords, I am sorry to\ncall upon you so early,” he said, “but we have grave issues to discuss.”\n“Where is Arch Lector Glokta?” asked Gorodets, glancing nervously up\nat Gorst, who towered implacably at Orso’s shoulder.\n“I accepted his resignation just after dawn.” There was a collective gasp.\nOrso held out a hand to Pike, whose spotless white garments made his face\nlook, if anything, more blighted and expressionless than his black ones had.\n“Arch Lector Pike has taken charge of the Inquisition.”\n“Resigned?” whispered Hoff. “But why?”\n“Because his son-in-law, Leonault dan Brock, Lord Governor of\nAngland, plans to rebel against the Crown.”\nBrock’s treachery left the room even more stunned than Glokta’s\nresignation. Gorodets was tugging so hard at his beard Orso worried he\nmight tear his lower jaw off. “Can we be sure?”\n“I was informed anonymously. But on my trip to Sipani I met with King\nJappo of Styria.”\n“You…” Matstringer looked like he might swallow his tongue. “This is\nan unprecedented breach of protocol—”\n“Treason takes precedence,” grated out Pike.\n“It had to be an informal meeting,” said Orso. “Off the books.” Most of\nthe old men were looking thunderstruck. Whether at the news of imminent\nrebellion, or the discovery that Orso was capable of arranging something on\nhis own, it was unclear. “Jappo confirmed my worst fears. The Young Lion\nhas gathered a considerable following of disaffected noblemen and means\nto invade Midderland.”\n“By the Fates,” croaked Hoff.\n“Worse still… he has enlisted the help of the King of the Northmen,\nStour Nightfall.”\n“He plans to bring those savages onto Union soil?” The surveyor\ngeneral’s voice reached so high a pitch, it was a wonder the windows did\nnot shatter.\n“Unthinkable,” whispered Hoff, slumping back in his chair.\n“Outrageous!” frothed Gorodets. “Send to the Superior in Angland!\nHave Brock arrested! Have him bloody hanged!”\n“Brock is loved in Angland,” said Pike, in his emotionless drone. “We\nare despised. As long as he makes no move against us, he is beyond our\nreach.”\n“Your Majesty.” Brint leaned forward with his one fist clenched, the\nyellow stone on his ring glinting. “The King’s Own are scattered to counter\nthe threat of the Breakers. Lord Marshal Rucksted is in Keln with most of\nthe cavalry. We must concentrate our forces at once so we are ready to meet\nany rebel threat and decisively crush it.” And he thumped the table and\nmade several of the other old men jump.\n“Agreed,” said Orso.

The first useful contribution. “Please send out the\norders, Marshal Brint, to Rucksted and the rest. In the meantime, we must\ndo everything possible to pull the noblemen’s teeth.”\n“The Open Council stands in summer recess,” said Hoff. “Some\nmembers are in the city still, but most will have repaired to their estates.”\nGorodets swallowed. “Several sought dispensation to raise extra soldiers\nbecause of fears over the Breakers. Very many extra soldiers… in some\ncases…”\nAn uneasy muttering swept the table. Brint clenched his fist even tighter.\nThe high consul glanced furtively at Gorst. Hoff dabbed at his sweaty\nforehead with the fur-trimmed sleeve of his gown. The whole stuffy little\nroom reeked of panic and suspicion. By the Fates, any one of the old\nbastards could have been the traitor.\n“Go to your departments,” said Orso, “and make preparations. I want\nour defences shored up. I want forces on high alert. I want anything disloyal\nrooted out.” He stood, planting his hands on the table. “You are the only\nones I can trust. My father’s faithful advisors. My loyal Closed Council. If\nwe stay together, we will yet weather this storm.”\nOrso strode from the room, and with a screeching of chair legs the old\nmen struggled up after him.\nInto the Light\n“Y\nou got them?” asked Vick.\n“We got them,” said the Practical, voice muffled through his mask.\nHis black-clothed colleagues swarmed over the white-tiled bathhouse\nlike an infestation of beetle, necks and foreheads beaded with sweat, sticks\nin their hands or blades wetly glinting. Men naked or wrapped in towels\ncringed against the walls. One lay on his side, sobbing, bloody hands\nclapped to his mouth. Another was sprawled face down in a dark slick, a\ndagger lying nearby, a pink bloom spreading into a pool beside him.\nVick stepped over the corpse and into the steamy little chamber beyond,\na mosaic of intertwined snakes just visible on the floor. Appropriate. Two\nmen sat on a bench, naked except for cloths around their waists. One was\nblond-haired and handsome, with moustaches he’d clearly put a lot of effort\ninto cultivating.\n“Lord Heugen,” she said.\nAs the steam thinned, she saw the other man more clearly. Older, grey-\nhaired, the whole left side of his body oddly withered. His left arm was\ngone above the elbow, a long-healed stump.\n“And Lord Marshal Brint.” Vick allowed herself the thinnest smile.\n“There’s one riddle solved.”\n“And who the bloody hell are you?” sneered Heugen.\n“Vick dan Teufel, Inquisitor Exempt.”\nBrint gave a resigned sigh and ever so slowly sagged back. Heugen kept\nbristling. “One of Old Sticks’ cronies, eh? Well, he’s gone too far this time\n—”\n“He’s gone altogether,” said Vick. “Retired. Didn’t the lord marshal tell"

I’m here on the king’s personal orders. So you can forget about\nappealing to a higher authority. There isn’t one.”\nHeugen’s voice had gone shrill. “There’s no law against visiting a\nbathhouse!”\n“No, but judges take a dim view of planning treason in one.”\n“How dare you! The marshal and I are old friends. We’ve been talking\nof surprising our families with a joint garden party—”\n“Hope I get an invite,” said Vick. “I love an outdoor function.” She\nglanced over at Tallow, lurking in a steamy corner, dressed like an attendant\nin sandals and loincloth, almost as skinny as the mop he leaned on. “Well?\nDid they talk about surprising the relatives? Or maybe giving someone else\na shock?”\n“Lord Marshal Brint discussed a meeting of the Closed Council this\nmorning,” said Tallow, calmly. He was actually getting good at this. “Said\nthe king had discovered their plans. Then Lord Heugen talked of sending\nwarnings to their friends, and of moving up the schedule. He also\nmentioned leaving the city at once and gathering his troops.”\nVick raised one brow. “Sounds like a hell of a party.”\n“You led them straight to us!” Heugen bared his teeth at Brint. “You\none-armed dunce!”\n“The king’s idea, in fact,” said Vick. “The man’s not half the fool you’ve\ntaken him for. He knew someone on the Closed Council was betraying him,\njust wasn’t sure who, so he rattled the cage and I caught what dropped\nloose. And here we are.” Damn, it was hot in there. Her jacket was already\nclinging wet from the steam. She started unbuttoning it. “So tell me. Who\nelse is on the guest list for your garden party? Your little conspiracy against\nthe Crown?” She peeled her jacket off and tossed it to Tallow, leaned down\nover Heugen in her vest, hands on her knees. “I want names. Now.”\n“Don’t tell her a bloody thing,” said Brint.\n“Don’t worry about that,” sneered Heugen. “My lips are—”\nVick slapped him across the face, and not gently. He gasped as his head\nsnapped sideways, turned slowly back to stare at her in stunned disbelief,\none trembling hand raised to his pinking cheek. She wondered if it was the\nfirst time someone ever hit him hard. A life of luxury is poor preparation for\na beating. Who’d know better than her, the pampered daughter of the\nMaster of the Royal Mints, suddenly snatched away to the mines of\nAngland?\nMaybe that thought put a bit more venom in her next slap, hard enough\nto get his mouth bleeding. “You’ve given me no time to be subtle,” she\nhissed at him, “so this is going to get very painful very fast.” She slapped\nhim again, even harder, her fingers stinging and blood speckling the wall\nbeside his face. “Give me names.”\nTears glimmered in the corners of Heugen’s eyes.

The sudden pain, and\nthe confusion, and the terrible, terrible shock of finding the world was not at\nall what you had thought. She knew how it felt. “I… demand—”\nHer fist thudded into his ribs and he gave a breathy grunt, eyes bulging.\nNo doubt, safe in the armour of his wealth and status, he’d always thought\nhimself a strong man. Now, surrounded by Practicals and with all his\narmour stripped away, he learned how strong he really was. Her other fist\nsank into his side and he twisted over, groaning, his loincloth slipping off,\nleaving him stark naked and helpless on the bench.\n“Names!” She climbed on top of him, knee in his back, the smacks and\nthuds of her punches falling dead on the steamy air.\n“Names!” He gasped and gurgled, tried to curl up into a ball, and she\nleaned over and punched him in the arse, caught his fruits and made him\nhowl.\n“Names, fucker!”\n“Isher!” he squealed, sobbing. “It was all Isher’s idea!” He talked so fast\nhe was almost sick, the names tumbling over each other. “Isher and\nBarezin! They brought Brock in! And Brock brought Stour Nightfall, and\nthat woman Rikke, the Dogman’s daughter! Lots of others on the Open\nCouncil. There’s Lady Wetterlant, and… and…”\n“What’s happened to the world?” whispered Brint as he watched\nHeugen spill his guts with a look of disbelieving contempt.\n“Far as I can tell, it’s always been like this.” Vick jerked her head\ntowards the Practical. “Get him to the House of Questions. See what else he\nknows.”\n“Wait!” slobbered Heugen as he was dragged out by the wrist, trying to\ncover his prick with his other hand. “I can be useful!” He clutched at the\narchway. “Please! No!” With an annoyed grunt, the Practical ripped him\nfree and he was gone.\n“Have to say I’m surprised it was you.” Vick frowned over at Lord\nMarshal Brint. “Always took you for an honourable man.”\n“Why do you think I did it? We’re supposed to be a Union!” He roared\nthe last word with sudden anger, clenching his one fist, and Vick stepped\nback, watchful. She reckoned him far more dangerous than Heugen,\nhowever many limbs he was missing.\nBut all he did was sag back against the tiles. “I fought the Northmen in\nthe High Places, you know. Held my best friend while he died. Then again\nat Osrung. Lost my arm there. Lost my wife there.” And he looked down at\nthe ring on his little finger. A woman’s ring with a yellow stone. “I gave my\nwhole life for the Union. For the idea that we stand together. Then they\nattacked our Protectorate. Land the king had sworn to defend. And what did\nwe do? Nothing.” He said the word as if he couldn’t believe it. “We left"

Nothing.” He said the word as if he couldn’t believe it. “We left\nLady Finree and our brothers in Angland to fend for themselves. And why?\nSo we could make a few more payments to the Banking House of Valint and\nBalk? The Closed Council sold our principles for a few marks. And they\ndare talk of treason?”\nHe looked up at her with weary eyes. “None of this will make any\ndifference. The noblemen are already out of your reach, gathering their\nforces. The Young Lion is on his way. He’ll put things right again.”\nVick gave a snort. “You should tell the folk I saw die in the camps how\nright things used to be. You’re going to shed a sea of blood, and the best\nyou’ll manage is to swap one set of bastards for another. Principles? I’d\nlaugh if I had the stomach.” She frowned down at his hand. “Now give me\nthat ring.”\n“Inquisitor Teufel.” Glokta smiled up, showing the yawning gap in his front\nteeth. “Thank you for coming.”\nIt only occurred to her then that she could’ve stayed away. Could’ve\nignored him. But obedience can be a hard habit to break. Ask any dog.\n“Of course.” She sat stiffly on the bench where they had met before,\nmore than once. It took an effort not to add Your Eminence.\nShe had never seen him without his white robes, his ring of office, his\nblack-clad entourage. The awe-inspiring Arch Lector had become,\novernight, a withered old man, heavily wrapped up even in the summer\nwarmth, attended by just the one huge Practical who used to push his chair,\nawkward in simple footman’s clothes and with a rash about his mouth from\nthe mask he no longer wore. Glokta had been her saviour, her mentor, her\nmaster, her jailer. She wondered what they were now, without the office and\nthe great desk and the vast difference in power? Friends? She had to\nsuppress a splutter of entirely inappropriate laughter at the thought of the\nword.\n“I hear congratulations are in order once again. Lord Heugen’s\nfaithlessness is far from surprising but it shocks me that Lord Marshal Brint\nwould betray the Crown.” Glokta slowly shook his head. “Ten years we sat\ntogether on the Closed Council.”\n“You think you know someone…” murmured Vick, rubbing absently at\nher bruised knuckles as she frowned out at the sunlight glittering on the\nlake. People were boating, laughing, lounging on the banks. You would\nnever have thought a civil war was coming. But then the worst betrayals\noften happen in good weather. When there’s a blizzard blowing, people are\ntoo busy huddling together.\n“I am leaving Adua today,” said Glokta. “My wife thinks the country air\nmay be good for my health. That is… what she tells me she thinks, anyway.\nI suspect she does not want us to become sad ghosts haunting the halls\nwhere we were once powerful. I suspect she is wise in this, as in so much\nelse.” He cleared his throat. “Before I left, I wanted to thank you.”\nShe looked sharply across at him. She should have been pleased to get"

She should have been pleased to get\nthe thanks of the man she’d served faithfully for so many years. But\npleasure was not her first feeling.\n“For all you have done for me,” he went on, not meeting her eye. “Done\nfor the Union. Especially given… what the Union has done for you. Or\nwhat it has failed to do. By my judgement, our new king has had few more\nvaluable servants. So. Thank you. For your courage. Your diligence. Your…\npatriotism.”\n“Diligence and patriotism.” She gave a bitter snort, slowly clenching her\naching fist. “That or lack of choices. That or being too much of a coward to\nfind another way. That or sticking to the habits of the camps, and grabbing\nthe chance to stand with the winners, and making the only move up the\nconvict can see—from taking the beating to giving it.”\nShe wasn’t sure why she was suddenly angry. Because of the things he’d\nmade her do? Or because he wouldn’t be there to make her do more?\n“Well.” Glokta looked towards the summer revellers. So near to them,\nyet somehow in a different world. “I have often said that life is the misery\nwe endure between disappointments. Whatever the reasons, you have never\nonce disappointed me. I wish I had been so reliable in return, but I fear I\nhave let you down. I know how much you want to be… need to be…\nloyal.”\n“Loyal.” She thought of all the people she’d lied to, deceived, sold out\nover the last eight years. It was quite the list. Malmer dangling above the\nroad to Valbeck. Sibalt and his pathetic little dreams of the Far Country.\nMoor and Grise. Tallow and his sister. She could still smell the rebels’ camp\nin Starikland, after she told the soldiers where to find them. “I betray people\nfor a living.”\n“Yes.” He gave her a knowing glance. “Perhaps that’s why you need to\nbe loyal. I always imagined there would be time to give you your proper\nreward, but… at the pinnacle of power, as you see… time runs out\nsuddenly. Might I at least give you one piece of advice, before I go?”\nShe could have said no. She could have punched him in the face. But\nshe did nothing.\nHe reached up to gently wipe some wet from under his leaking left eye.\n“Forgive yourself.”\nShe sat there, on that bench, jaw clenched, breath hissing fast in her\nnose, while down on the banks of the lake someone gave a braying peel of\nlaughter at some joke.\n“There is no way out of the camps without His Majesty’s approval.”\nShe could have stuck her fingers in her ears. She could have got up and\nstalked away. Instead she sat there, her skin turned cold and every muscle\nrigid.\n“Your brother’s little prisoners’ revolution was doomed from the start.”\nShe remembered that last glimpse of his face. The shock and the hurt as\nthey dragged him away. She remembered it as if it was happening now.\n“It would have been easy to give in to sentimentality,” said Glokta. “But"

When she turned back, his eyes\nwere fixed on her, fever-bright.\n“Everyone should forgive themselves, Vick.” He gave her wrist another\nsqueeze then let her go, looking out towards the lake again. “After all… no\none else will.”\nSome Men Can’t Help Themselves\nB\nroad knelt there, in the dirt, in the darkness, axe in his fist, frowning\nacross bare mud studded with tree stumps.

If there was such a\nthing as no more trouble, he’d got himself about as far from it as a man\ncould get.\nHe’d promised Liddy no more trouble. But he’d promised her a good\nlife, too. What do you do when one promise runs head first into another?\nHe’d no choice. Had to do this. For Savine, for his family.\nThat, and the thing he didn’t really want to think about—how the axe\nfelt so right in his fist as he gripped it tighter than ever.\n“They’re late,” grunted Sarlby.\nBroad turned to look at him, the glint of moonlight in the corners of his\nsunken eyes and on the edges of his loaded flatbow. “Coming to something\nwhen you can’t rely on folk to come timely to their own ambush.”\n“Shhhh,” hissed Judge.\nBroad shifted back into the shadows as he heard the faint sound of\nhoofs, rattling harness, grind of carriage wheels.\nThe fear sharpened, and the excitement underneath it, creeping up his\nthroat as lamplight glimmered on the rotten tree stumps, gleamed on the\npuddles in the road, caught the sharpened logs of the collapsing fence and\nthe long shed with its fallen-in roof.\nThe pulse thudded in his head as the first riders came through the trees\ninto the open. Soldiers with lanterns, hint of red uniforms, helmets and\nbreastplates gleaming. A dozen, maybe. Then a wagon of some sort. A big,\nblack, weighty shape pulled by a team of six.\nThe beam of a lantern came stabbing towards the trees as one of the\nriders turned, Judge’s tattered silhouette frozen before they all shrank into\nthe bushes.

A crashing explosion clapped off the trees, a\nwhizzing like angry wasps, flicking and pinging in the undergrowth.\nSomething thudded into the trunk beside them in a spray of splinters.\nSarlby ducked down.\n“Fuck!” someone hissed.\n“Yes!” screamed Judge, standing up and throwing her fists into the sky.\nBroad was already running. Towards the lamplight, the plunging horses,\nthe swelling cloud of smoke. Pounding across the clearing for the road and\nthe sawmill, the black world bouncing, the quick breath hissing through his\ngritted teeth, the eagerness boiling up his throat, setting him on fire.\nHis boot hit something in the darkness. Stump or root or rut. It spun him\naround, he fell and went sliding on his face in the mud. Near cut himself on\nhis axe. Maybe he did cut himself. He was up again, running again, towards\nthe flickering, smearing lights. Towards the great wagon. One of its six\nhorses looked to be dead, the others had dragged it from the road, plunging\nin the traces, left it leaning against a stump with one wheel uselessly\nspinning, driver slumped in his seat.\nBroad dashed around it, axe raised, ready to strike, then ducked back\nfrom flailing hooves, spraying mud. A horse was rearing and screaming and\nbiting, maddened, flanks wet with blood, a dead man bouncing after it, one\nboot caught in the stirrup and his breastplate all riddled with holes.\nSomeone was screaming, rolling, wreathed in fire.

His lantern must’ve\ngot shattered in the blast, sprayed him with burning oil. A soldier dragged\nhimself up, helmet all skewed, twisted face sticky red, trying to draw his\nsword. Broad’s axe smashed the side of his head in.\n“What happened?” someone shouted, stumbling from the smoke. Red\njacket. Gold braid. An officer. “You!” he shouted at Broad. Outraged. Not\nunderstanding. “What is all—”\nBroad’s axe caught him right between the eyes, knocked his hat off and\nsnapped his head back, arms flung wide as if he was offering a hug. He\nflopped into a puddle, blood flooding from the slice out of his forehead.\n“Ambush!” someone screeched. “Ambush!”\nA rider came at him, sword raised. Broad reeled away, caught his horse\nin the face with his axe. It lurched sideways, toppled. The rider fell under it,\nyelling something. Broad hacked at him, missed and chopped deep into the\nhorse’s flank. The man tried to swing but trapped under the horse there was\nno venom in it, his sword just bounced off Broad’s leg. Broad stepped on\nthe soldier’s sword arm, raised the axe high and stove his breastplate in with\na hollow clonk.\nHe heard something behind him. Coughed. Groaned. Head hurt. He was\nlying on his face. Someone hit him? Tried to shake it off. Closed his hand\naround the cold shaft of the axe. Staggered up.\nEverything was a sparkling blur. Writhing shadows. Smears of light.\nLenses must’ve got knocked off. Only then he realised he’d even had ’em\non. Shadows flickered and stabbed. He could hear Judge’s voice. A\ndemented shriek. “Kill ’em! Kill ’em!”\nA horse thundered past. He heard its hooves, felt the wind of it. He\nlashed with his axe, hit nothing and spun right around, nearly fell.\nSomeone was screaming. “No! No! Please!” And then they were just\nscreaming. Was it him? No, he had his teeth clenched, moaning and snarling\nthrough them, not even words, just heaved breath and sprayed spit. Couldn’t\nthink. Couldn’t see. Prickling with sweat under his new breastplate.\nHad a feeling two writhing shadows was one man stabbing another but\nhe’d no idea who was who. There were no sides. Only those doing the\nkilling and those getting killed.\nHe saw a man-shaped shadow against flames, stepped towards it, raising\nthe axe high.\n“Woah!” Hard to tell, but looked like the man was cringing back,\nholding up a hand. “Woah, there, Bull!”\nBannerman’s voice. Broad could just about recognise it through the\nringing in his ears. Took an effort to lower the axe. Far more than to swing\nit. Felt heavy now. Hard to breathe, chest aching.\nHe squinted into the darkness. Started casting about for his lenses, bent\nover. Near tripped on something. A corpse, maybe.

Judge’s voice as well, dripping\nmenace. “Open this fucking carriage or we’ll crack it open!”\n“Here you go.” Halder pressed something into Broad’s palm. His fingers\nwere hurting now. A bunch of numb sausages. He was scared he’d crush his\ndelicate little lenses in his hands. Held them to the light, squinting, almost\nright up against his face. Wiped them, wincing, finally fumbled them back\nonto his nose.\nDead men. Dead horses. Mud and blood, black in the light of fires from\nspilled lamp oil. That acrid smell of Gurkish sugar and charred meat he\nremembered from the sieges. He’d thought he never wanted to smell that\nagain. Now he dragged it into his nostrils like a connoisseur might nose a\nglass of wine. Burners stood about, with their bright new arms and armour.\nSarlby, grinning, empty flatbow over his shoulder.\nBroad’s head was throbbing. He touched his fingers to the side of it, tips\ncame away red. Good thing you’ve a thick skull, Liddy would’ve said, and\nMay would’ve laughed. But Broad couldn’t see their faces. As blurred as if\nthe lenses had slipped from his memory.\n“Your men are dead!” Judge was screaming at the wagon. Broad saw\nnow it was more like an armoured carriage, slit-windowed and covered in\niron plates. “Might be one or two rode off, but they don’t want any more of\nwhat we gave ’em. Help’s hours away. So I’m going to count to three,\nfucker, and if this carriage isn’t open, I’ll bring my cannon up here and\nopen it the hard way. One!”\n“All right!” came a muffled voice from inside. “I’m coming out.” There\nwas the squeaking of bolts being drawn and the carriage’s iron door\nclattered open. Judge’s men started forward, dragged someone out. A small\nman in neat clothes, balding hair all messed-up and a bleeding cut on his\nscalp, some sort of case in his hand. Or no, chained to his wrist with heavy\nmanacles.\n“Thought it was prisoners,” grunted Broad, frowning at him. “Off to\nValbeck to be hanged, you said.”\nJudge shrugged. “I say all kinds o’ things.”\n“You bloody fools!” the man spluttered, staring wide-eyed at the\nwreckage. Like all this was as unbelievable as things falling upwards or the\nsun not rising in the morning. “Don’t you know who this belongs to? Don’t\nyou know who I work for?”\nJudge only grinned. “You’re the new manager of the new Valbeck\nbranch of the Banking House of Valint and Balk.” The man’s face slowly\nfell, outrage turning to fear, and fear to disbelieving horror. “You’ve come\nto take up your position after I sentenced the last manager to hang and\nburned the last bank down. Unless I’m much mistook, you’ve brought funds\nfor the building work, and look here…”\nTwo Burners clambered from the carriage, dragging a weighty chest\nwith them, the sound of money jingling inside as they threw it on the"

Maybe he always had trouble thinking. He\nwatched one of the Burners rooting through the pockets of a soldier’s\nmangled corpse. Must’ve been close to the cannon when it went off. He\nhardly had anything left you could even call a head. “What’s the bank got to\ndo with anything?”\nJudge stuck her lips out in mocking pity. “You really don’t see too good,\ndo you? Valint and Balk are the fucking enemy! Just as much as the king, or\nthe owners, or the Closed Council, or the Open. The worst o’ the lot, ’cause\nthey hold the purse strings. Why d’you think the very first thing we did in\nthe uprising was torch the bank?” Judge scooped coins out of the chest and\nlet them drop jingling back. “Every one o’ these is a soldier for the cause,\nBull Broad. Every single one.” Her eyes rolled towards that case the\nmanager had chained to his wrist. “What’s this?”\n“Nothing you’d want,” he said, hugging it to his chest.\nJudge raised her chin so she could scratch at her rashy neck. “I long ago\ntired o’ men explaining to me what I want.”\n“It’s of no value!” he whined, voice getting higher and higher, making\nBroad’s head ache worse and worse.\n“If it’s of no value, why’s it locked to your wrist in an armoured\ncarriage? Where’s the key?”\nHe stared back. “The whole point is I don’t have one.”\nJudge patted him on the cheek. “Don’t worry. I do.” And she slid her\ncleaver out. “Little help here?”\nTwo Burners seized hold of the manager from behind and dragged him\ndown beside a tree stump while Sarlby caught the case and the wrist it was\nchained to, started wrestling it towards him.\n“No!” squawked the manager, struggling desperately to keep it hugged\nto his chest. “You don’t know what they’ll do! Wait!”\n“For what?” said Judge, laughter in her voice. “The House o’ the Maker\nto open and great Euz to spring forth wreathed in fire? ’Cause that’s what\nit’ll take to stop this.” Sarlby finally tore the case free, braced his feet\nagainst the stump and dragged the manager’s arm across it by the chain\nwhile two other Burners held him, the bracelet cutting white into his wrist.\nA third raised a lamp high so no one missed anything, his eager grin lit from\nabove.\n“I find you guilty of offences against the people,” said Judge. “Of usury,\nfalse dealing and profiting from misery. Of delaying the Great Change. And\nmost of all, of selling your arse to those twin plagues Valint and Balk.”\n“No!” whimpered the manager, eyes bulging. “Please!”\nJudge weighed the cleaver. “Where’s the best spot, you reckon?”\nSarlby shrugged. “Between his hand and his elbow?”"

There was a sick thwack. The\nmanager gave a sobbing wail. But the blade didn’t even cut through his\nsleeve, let alone his arm. It just bounced off.\n“Shit,” said Judge. She took the cleaver in both hands, arched all the\nway back and swung it down with all her strength. Another thud, another\nhowl, and it bounced off again, gouging the stump a little. Broad rubbed at\nthe sore bridge of his nose. His head was pulsing.\n“Who’s in charge of keeping this sharp?” Judge held her cleaver up to\nthe flickering firelight while the manager of the Valbeck branch of Valint\nand Balk sobbed and whimpered. You could see the bones in his wrist were\nbroken. His arm was crooked as an old twig. But decidedly still attached.\n“Sarlby? My cleaver’s blunt.”\nSarlby watched the whole business with an expression of weary\nboredom. The kind they’d all had in Styria, by the end, after bearing witness\nto a procession of horrors. “What am I? A knife-grinder?” The manager\nstarted howling again.\n“Fuck!” snarled Broad, and his axe took the man’s arm off just above the\nwrist with a meaty thunk, spattering everyone around the stump with blood.\nSarlby fell back, the case tumbling free, the manager’s severed hand\nflopping loose in his lap.\n“That’s got it!” called Judge as Broad’s axe smashed the case wide open\nwith three more savage blows.\nThe manager took a great whooping breath as he stared at the blood\nwelling from the stump of his arm, then the axe split his skull and cut his\nshriek off dead. Broad dragged it free of his ruined head, stood there with\nteeth bared, looking for something else to hit.\nOne of the two men who’d been holding the manager scrambled away.\nThe other shrank back, eyes wide. Broad stood a moment longer, every\nmuscle flexed tight, then with a roar that made them all flinch again, he\nflung the axe down and it bounced away across the road.\nThere was a pause, everyone staring. Then Judge gave a little giggle.\n“Ouch,” she said, her eyes wide and her pale face dotted with blood, black\nin the lamplight. “Always knew you belonged with us. With me. To me.”\nSarlby tossed the hand away and shook the contents of the case onto the\nmuddy ground. “Just papers,” he grunted, holding up a sheaf of documents.\nJudge started leafing through them by the flickering light of one of the fires.\n“Deeds and contracts and legal whatever-the-fuck.” She started to drop\nthem into the flames, paper covered in swirling calligraphy blackening and\ncurling as it caught light. “Won’t be worth shit when the Great Change\ncomes, eh?” And she grinned up at Broad, letting the rest slide from her"

Felt like\nsomething he’d seen happen. Not something he’d done himself. He put a\nhand to his head again. It was hurting worse than ever. Damn, he needed a\ndrink. But he knew it never helped. Quite the opposite.\n“Look at you, you poor thing.” He felt Judge catch his face, drag it\ntowards her so he had no choice but to stare into her gleaming eyes. “Is it\nright, is it wrong, what have I done, and blah, blah, fucking blah. You done\nworse to better men, I’ve no doubt, but the truth is, there’s no answers to\nthose questions that mean a thing. Sooner you stop pretending and let go of\nall that shit for good, the better for you, the better for me, the better for\neveryone.”\n“I have to go,” whispered Broad. He’d sworn no more trouble. “I have\nto tell Lady Savine… to send more weapons.” Like that could ever change\nthings for the better. “I owe her.” Not even sure who he was talking to. “She\nsaved my family.”\n“Nice story. She could put it in her next fucking pamphlet.” Judge\npicked up the fallen officer’s hat and knocked out the dent Broad’s axe had\nmade. “But don’t try to trick a trickster. I don’t think you care a shit about\nyour debts. Or even about your family. I think you know there’s a fight\ncoming, and you can’t stand the thought o’ being left out. I think you’re like\nme.” She perched the hat on her riot of red hair, back to front, and opened\nher eyes very wide. “Only happy when you’re bloody.”\nBroad stood staring. The best judge of character, she’d said. Knew men\nbetter than they knew themselves.\n“What about this lot?” Sarlby was asking, hands on hips as he frowned\nat all the dead men.\n“We’re Burners, ain’t we? If in doubt, burn it.” Judge waved Broad\naway with a queenly waft of one red-stained hand. “Have it your way. Tell\nyour precious Lady Savine she’s got a deal. I’ll speak to the Weaver.\nMessengers’ll wriggle out to every crew of Breakers in the Union. On the\nlast day of summer, the king’ll have an uprising to make Valbeck look like a\nbirthday party.” She stuck her lips out in a pout. “I almost feel sorry for the\npoor bastard. He’ll have no friends left to fight the Young Lion. Now off\nyou pop.”\n“Just like that?” whispered Broad.\n“If I’m about one thing, it’s freedom. Why have a fucking bull if you\nkeep it chained? We both know you’ll be back.” She turned away, giving a\nsly grin over her shoulder, and tipped that dead man’s hat at him. “Some\nmen just can’t help ’emselves.”"

We both know you’ll be back.” She turned away, giving a\nsly grin over her shoulder, and tipped that dead man’s hat at him. “Some\nmen just can’t help ’emselves.”\nA Meeting with Destiny\nS\navine had attended several parades with her parents and never much\nenjoyed them. They had always struck her as a lot of pompous guff, and her\nfather’s grumbling about the waste of time and money had hardly helped.\nBut she had to admit she was enjoying this one.\nAs dawn broke, the army of Angland filed through Ostenhorm towards\nthe quay, where just about every vessel in the province had been pressed\ninto service as a transport, the harbour made a shifting thicket by their\nmasts. Drums thumped, pipes tooted, sergeants bellowed, boots tramp,\ntramp, tramped. The salt breeze caught flags stitched with old victories, the\nrising sun gleamed on gear newly forged in Savine’s own armouries.\nAnd then there was Leo, the magnificent centrepiece to all this\npageantry. He was utterly in his element, magnificent in dark grey uniform\nand gilded breastplate, roaring lions stitched into his cloak. Like a candle\nflame in a dark room, every eye was drawn towards him, every cheer and\nsalute sent in his direction. He rode constantly up and down on his snorting,\npawing warhorse as though a moment still was a moment wasted, trading\njokes with the men, urging them on, standing in his stirrups to wave each\ncompany aboard.\n“They look good, don’t they?” he asked, reining in beside her, gazing at\nthe passing columns like a girl at her intended. “They look damn good.”\n“Almost as good as their general,” she said, glancing at him sidelong.\nHe reached out and put a gentle hand on her belly. “I love you.”\nSavine blinked at him. The truth was she had only loved one man, and\nhe was the one they were going to war with. Love was unlucky. An\nencumbrance. She smiled, and pressed her hand against his, and felt their\nbaby shift underneath it. “I love you, too,” she said, and shut him up with a\nkiss. There was plenty to like about Leo, after all. Especially at the head of\nan army. But there were some tasks he was not suited for.\n“Wherever is Jurand?” she asked as they broke apart. “He organised\nmost of this.” Antaup was laughing with a crowd of officers, and\nWhitewater Jin had stripped off his armour to help heft barrels aboard one\nof the transports. But she saw none of Leo’s other friends. Normally it took\na heroic effort to prise them from his side. “And Glaward? He was meant to\n—”\n“They won’t be coming,” said Leo, jaw muscles working.\nSavine sighed. “Did you have some falling out in Sipani?” They could\nbe like a gaggle of schoolgirls with their bickering. “Honestly, Leo, we can\nuse every man, and Jurand more than anyone, you need someone beside\nyou who—”\n“Has a brain?” he forced through gritted teeth.\nWon’t shit the bed in a crisis was what she wanted to say, but with Leo in"

You\ncan’t let some petty—”\nLeo growled each word with furious precision. “They will not be\ncoming.”\n“Leo!” It was almost a shriek, and Savine’s heart sank. Lady Finree was\nforcing her way through the baffled onlookers who had gathered beside the\nroad.\nThe young lieutenant who’d been given the job of watching her hurried\nafter, pink with embarrassment. “I tried to keep her out of the way, Your\nGrace, but—”\n“What’s happening, Leo?” She looked pale, and scared, and much older\nthan she had when Savine first met her, especially with her son sitting so far\nabove her on his tall, tall horse. “This must be half of Angland’s army—”\n“All of it.”\n“But… going where?”\n“To war, Mother. Where else would an army go?”\n“Leo, I’ve heard a rumour…” She said the words in a horrified whisper.\n“That you mean to move against the Closed Council.” She gave a desperate,\nquivery smile. “Tell me it’s not true!”\nThere was a pause. “They’ve gone too bloody far!” snapped Leo.\n“Someone needs to stand up to the bastards.”\nLady Finree glanced over at Savine, and Savine studiously did not meet\nher eye, feeling just the slightest bit guilty for the elaborate deception she\nhad worked on the woman. “Leo, you can’t mean…” She plucked weakly at\nhis knee, at his saddle. “This is armed revolt. This is treason!”\nSavine felt a chill creeping up her back, then. As though, in spite of all\nher long preparations, because no one had actually said the words, she had\nnot realised quite what they were about. That chill became colder yet as she\nrecognised another familiar face. Yoru Sulfur, that humble representative of\nthe Order of Magi, slipping through the crowds towards Lady Finree’s side.\n“This is patriotism!” snapped Leo.\n“By the Fates, listen to yourself. You don’t understand!” Finree dropped\nher voice, eyes darting nervously over to Sulfur and back. “Undertakings\nwere made, to get us where we are. To get you where you are.” She dropped\nher voice further. “I made promises to Bayaz—”\n“Bayaz? What the bloody hell does he have to do with anything?”\n“Everything,” said Sulfur, looking very directly up at Savine. She\nremembered the First of the Magi offering her a statue on the Kingsway.\nMentioning profitable partnerships and healthy competition. Telling her that\nknowing one’s own ignorance was the first step towards enlightenment. And\nshe remembered promising her father she would have nothing to do with\nthe man.\n“It’s not too late!” Finree was pleading. “I can write to the king, we can\nappeal for his mercy—”\nLeo gave a disgusted hiss and turned his horse, making his mother\nscramble back almost into Sulfur’s arms. “I’ve grovelled enough to that\nfool.

Of course you are, but…”\n“But what, Mother?”\n“You’re not a general!”\n“I seem to remember a battle at Red Hill!” he snapped, cheeks flushed\nred with anger. “I turned the tide there when no one else could!”\n“You led a charge!” She caught hold of his horse’s reins near the bit.\n“Managing an army is a very different thing! Let me come with you, at\nleast. Let me—”\n“No!” He tore his reins from her hand. “You’ve kept me in your shadow\nlong enough. It’s my time now!” And he spurred his horse savagely away.\n“I wonder how long his time will last,” murmured Sulfur, gently shaking\nhis head.\nFinree stared from him to Savine. She looked so utterly distraught that it\nwas hard to meet her eye. “Have you thought about what you’re risking?\nHave you thought about what happens if you lose?”\n“There is nothing I have thought about more,” said Savine. Except what\nwould happen if she won, of course. She already had most of the details of\nher coronation planned.\n“People will be hurt.” Savine was disappointed to see there were tears in\nFinree’s eyes. She really was throwing away all the respect anyone used to\nhave for her. “People will die!”\n“And my master,” added Sulfur, “will be seriously displeased.”\nSavine looked down her nose at him. “As my father once said, if you\nwant to change the world, sometimes you have to burn it down.”\n“But Bayaz,” pleaded Finree, “our arrangement—”\n“Shit on Bayaz. I did not reach my place in life by paying the interest on\nother people’s debts.” Savine snapped her fingers at one of Leo’s aides.\n“Escort Lady Finree and her friend back to the Lord Governor’s residence.\nAnd see that they do not interfere.”\n“Your Grace.”\n“Leo, please!” Finree shrieked as she was hustled away. “Savine!”\nBut Savine had already turned her horse towards the ships and clicked\nher tongue to move him on.\nShe couldn’t have been much over sixteen, this girl, but she strode up bold\nas you like. She had broad, solid shoulders and broad, solid hips and a\nbroad, solid jaw she was intent on aiming at Shivers however far he\ntowered above her, which was quite the distance as she wasn’t tall. She\nplanted the butt of an old spear on the ground in front of him, her broad,\nsolid knuckles white about the time-darkened haft.\nHe looked down mildly at her. “Hello?”\n“I want to talk to Rikke,” she growled.\nShivers held out his hand. “There she is.”\n“What, her?”\n“No,” said Isern-i-Phail. “Rikke is the other one-eyed woman with runes"

Reminded Rikke of one o’ those mean little dogs\nthat’ll take on anything, no matter how big.\n“Then fight you shall. We can use every spear. Get this girl a shield!”\nshe called to one of the smiths, and Corleth strutted off with her broad jaw\nin the air, much pleased to be a warrior.\n“Don’t like her looks,” said Isern, eyes narrowed.\n“You don’t like anyone’s looks,” said Rikke. “You’re just jealous of her\nyouth and strong hips.”\nIsern propped her hands on her own hips, such as they were. “I’m the\nway the moon wants me and naught wrong about it from where I stand.”\nRikke snorted. “You’re straight down like a sausage, and a gristly one at\nthat.”\n“You’re a fine one to talk, Skinny Rikke.

        "text": "smiths and fletchers of Uffrith had worked their hands raw the past few\nweeks arming folk, then they’d stuck on helmets themselves and joined the\nthrong. Some of the town’s women had even took a break from nattering at\nthe well to stitch Rikke a standard of her own. A big eye, with runes around\nit like the ones tattooed into her face. The Long Eye, on a red field, looking\ninto what comes. It slapped and flapped against its pole behind her now,\nlooking down on the greatest weapontake Uffrith ever saw.\n“You sure about this?” murmured Shivers. “Not too late to turn back.”\nRikke frowned at him. “Never marked you as a turner-backer.”\nShivers only shrugged. He was a tough man to offend. Maybe living\nwith a wound like his made harsh words seem harmless. “I’m for whatever\nworks.”\n“Well, you’re a big man, so you wouldn’t understand. When you’re\nsmall, you have to take chances. We might not get another chance like this.”\nShivers frowned at the warriors gathered, and slowly nodded. “Aye, I\nreckon.”\n“Besides.” And Rikke leaned close, and nudged him in the ribs with her\nelbow, which was something like nudging a tree trunk. “It’ll turn out\nsweet.” She pulled down her cheek so her left eye popped at him. “I’ve seen\nit. Now get ’em ready, I’ve a mind to speechify.”\n“You really seen it?” murmured Isern in her ear.\n“All you know is what I say I’ve seen. And I say I’ve seen it.”\nIsern winked. “There’s the Long Eye for you.”\n“Listen!” Shivers was calling, but his whispery voice didn’t have much\npoke to it and no one heard. “Listen!” But it was quieter than last time if\nanything. He took another breath.\n“Open your ears, you fucking maggots!” screamed Isern-i-Phail, so loud\nRikke flinched at it. But silence fell, and everyone turned towards her. So\nmany faces, choking the square and the streets about it. More of her people\nthan she’d ever seen gathered in one place. More than she’d known she had.\nMade her heart swell, to see them come out on her say-so. She thought of\nhow proud her father would’ve been as she clambered up on the wall beside\nIsern, and it gave her a lump in her throat. She pushed back the hood she’d\nmade from Savine’s red cloth and tried to scrub some life into her flattened\nhair with her fingernails.\n“You know I’m one of you!” she screeched, voice a bit broken. “I’ll\nconfess I look a touch odd these days, and maybe I am a touch odd, but you\nknow I’m one of you. Born in Uffrith. Raised in Uffrith. Hope to die in\nUffrith. Hope that last’ll be some ways off still.” A bit of laughter at that, a\nwhoop or two and some light drinking. Rikke waved ’em down. “My father\ndid all he could to keep this place free!”\n“The Dogman!” someone roared, and there was a respectful mumble and\ngrumble of his name repeated."

But here we are,\nstill stuck ’twixt the Union and the North. It’s like we’ve a foot on either\nboat, but now the two are going different ways on the current, and if we\ndon’t jump to one or the other we’re apt to get torn in two.” She grimaced\nand grabbed her crotch. “And in the most sensitive spot!” More laughter at\nthat. Make ’em laugh, you’re halfway there, her father always told her.\n“But now we’ve got a chance to win our freedom for good!” She\nreached out, like there was something in the air she could nearly grasp. “It’s\nthere! Right in front of us! All we need is the bones to take it! And we will.\nI know we will!” She made a ring out of her finger and thumb, and held it to\nher left eye, and peered at them hard through the centre. “I’ve seen it!”\nShe flung up her arms and all those folk thrust their spears in the air and\nroared with one voice, all bound together in this grand adventure. All ready\nto risk everything to grab this chance. They were still cheering when she\nhopped down from the wall.\n“Nice speech,” croaked Shivers, stroking his sore throat.\n“Aye,” muttered Rikke, “but no one ever died from talking a good\nfight.” She rubbed at her own neck like she could rub away the nerves that\nhad gathered there. “Fighting one’s another matter.”\nThe rain had started coming not long after dawn, spitting down on the\nmilling crowds of warriors. Warriors from every part o’ the North where\nthey called Stour Nightfall king. Which was pretty much all of it.\nThere were tough Thralls in studded leather with spear or bow. There\nwere stout Carls in bright mail with axe and shield. There were Named Men\nwhose helm and hilt and harness glinted with jewels. There were wild men\nfrom the distant North with furs and warpaint. There were tattooed savages\nfrom out past the Crinna with their crooked standards of bone and hide.\nThere were thousands of the bastards.\nThey’d been flooding into the fields around Carleon for weeks. From up\nhere on the roof of the gatehouse, Clover could see the muddy stain of their\ncamps spread all the way up the far side of the valley. But the last day of\nsummer was coming fast and the camps were emptying now, little trickles\nof men joining to become streams, flowing down towards the road south\nwhere they became a marching river. Steel gleamed with wet as the drizzle\nfell, here and there the standards of one War Chief or another flapping over\nthe throng.\nStour watched this almighty mess with his arms folded, nodding like a\nbaker seeing the bread rise just the way he wanted. “Ever see a weapontake\nlike this, did you?”\nClover shrugged. “I’ve seen a few, and by and large they were about like\nthis one. Lots of men turning up with weapons. Sort of the point of the\nthing.”"

Sort of the point of the\nthing.”\nStour gave him a withering glance. “I meant, have you ever seen one so\nbig.”\n“I admit this is the biggest.” Apart from the one when Bethod went to\nwar against the Union. Or the one when the Union went to war against\nBlack Dow. But he doubted Stour wanted to hear that, and once you’ve seen\na man starve one poor bastard after another in a cage, you get quite\nsensitive to what he wants to hear. Which Clover imagined was the point o’\nthe exercise.\n“We’re going to show those Union bastards something,” snarled Stour.\n“On their own ground, this time. Never fought ’em in Midderland, eh?”\n“No.” Clover didn’t bother to say that men usually fight harder on their\nown ground. He doubted Stour wanted to hear that, either.\nBeing honest, he wasn’t sure why the young King of the Northmen kept\nhim close. He liked to think he was looked on as some noble mixture of\nbodyguard, advisor and mentor. In truth, the role probably tended more\ntowards jester. But what can you do but play the role you’re given?\n“You’re set on this, then?” Black Calder stepped from the staircase and\nout onto the gatehouse roof, grey-streaked hair plastered to his pale frown\nby the rain. He looked sourer by the day. Like milk left out in the sun.\nStour spread his arms to gather up that whole vast host. “Send ’em home\nnow, they’ll be so disappointed!”\n“I had a visit from Master Sulfur.” Calder rubbed worriedly at his grey\nstubble. He’d been pouring worry, doubt and scorn on the whole business\never since the first man turned up. “He’s not happy with this. And that\nmeans his master won’t be happy, either.”\nStour gave a snort. “Just as well my business ain’t making wizards\nhappy. Be a frustrating bloody line o’ work, eh, Clover?”\n“I guess,” murmured Clover, who found making kings happy frustrating\nenough.\n“Daresay you can look after things while I’m gone,” said Stour, clapping\na hand on his father’s back.\n“Managed well enough before you arrived,” growled Calder, shaking\nhim off. “Though you haven’t left me much to look after things with.” And\nhe glanced about the damp roof at the smattering of greybeards, bald-\nchinned boys and battle-maimed cripples who’d be guarding Skarling’s Hall\nwhile their king was off polishing his legend.\n“Need the men. Fighting the Union’s never been easy.”\nTrue enough. Bethod, Black Dow, Scale Ironhand, they’d all found it out\nthe hard way. The Union had been getting the better of better men than\nStour Nightfall for years.\nStour seemed to guess the way Clover was thinking and gave one of\nthose sly sideways winks of his, like they were all caught up together in the\nsame funny secret. “But we never had Angland on our side before.”\n“We had the First of the Magi on our side,” grunted Calder, getting even"

Loading all the dice.”\n“When I wanted his help, you said it wasn’t worth the price.”\n“I said don’t land yourself in his debt. I didn’t say spit in his eye.”\nCalder shook his head grimly. “You don’t understand what he is.”\nUnderstanding things was a problem for other folk, far as the Great Wolf\nwas concerned. He gave a hiss, half-boredom, half-disgust. “When did you\nturn so bloody sour, Father? To hear you carping, no one would ever guess\nyou won the North!”\nCalder spoke soft. “With Bayaz’s help, I won it. Like the Bloody-Nine.\nLike my father. If Bayaz starts helping someone else—”\n“Then I’ll fight ’em and I’ll win!” snarled Stour, showing his teeth. The\nsun came out then, peeping through a patch in the cloud, and brought a\nsparkle from the marching men. “Look at that!” There was a rainbow over\nthe road south towards Ollensand. “A good omen, I reckon. An archway\nwe’ll march through to victory!”\nCheers at that from some of the Named Men on the roof, and weapons\nshook, and calls of the Great Wolf. No one mentioned the one thing about\nrainbows that came at once to Clover—you can march at ’em for ever but\nyou’ll never actually reach the bastards.\nCalder gave a disgusted sigh as he watched the King of the Northmen\nswagger towards the steps. “The dead save me from the fucking young.”\n“No getting away from ’em, sadly,” muttered Clover. “The older you\nget, the more of ’em there are.”\nAs so often, his wit was wasted. Calder was frowning down at his fists,\nbunched on the grey stones of the parapet. “This was the spot where the\nBloody-Nine killed my father.”\n“Mmmm.” Clover remembered it well enough. He’d held a shield in that\nduel, between the Bloody-Nine and the Feared, before his name was even\nSteepfield, let alone Clover, a mad young bastard full of fire.\n“And his dream of the North united died with him.”\n“Mmmm.” Clover remembered the crunching as Bethod’s skull was\nsmashed to mush. The thud as his body dropped in the Circle.\n“For thirty years I’ve been trying to coax it back to life. Tending to it\nwith my every breath. We’re nearly there, Clover. One victory more.”\nClover had his doubts on that score. He’d seen victories enough, and\nthey were like the false summits of a great fell. You struggle towards ’em,\nsure you’ve made the top, then the moment you get there you see another\njust beyond. No fight was ever the last. No victory was ever for good. But\nBlack Calder was getting old. He wanted to see his great legacy secured\nbefore he went back to the mud. Then he could trick himself into believing\nit wouldn’t crumble a few moments after.\nHe gripped Clover by the arm. He had quite the grip, for a thin man."

He might not deserve it.”\n“Mmmm.”\n“But he’s the future, and the future has to be protected.”\nClover thought of that cage in Skarling’s Hall. “How do you protect a\nman from himself?”\n“He’ll learn better, in time.”\nClover had his doubts about that, too. Sooner or later, you have to stop\nexpecting folk to bend around your plans and fit your plans to the folk\nyou’ve got. But he reckoned Calder had laboured on his plans so long\nthey’d turned hard, and brittle, and apt to shatter. So he stuck to, “Mmmm.”\nIt was a contribution that worked for any circumstance. A listener could\nhear whatever they wanted in it.\n“If things turn sour over there, do whatever you have to, you\nunderstand? Bring him back alive. Do that, I’ll see you rewarded.”\n“Mmmm,” said Clover, one more time. “Well, I’ve always liked to be\nrewarded.”\nAnd he set off towards the steps to join the great army of the North.\nOrso’s command tent was, being generous, a shambles. In fact, since Hildi\nand a group of baffled soldiers were still scratching their heads over how to\nput half of it up, and Orso had known nothing about leading soldiers at\nValbeck a year before and learned nothing since, one could have said it was\na command tent featuring neither tent nor command.\nMessengers, scouts and adjutants blundered through in confusion,\ntrampling mud, tripping over guy-ropes and tearing down canvas. Orso\nhardly even knew what an adjutant was, yet he had about a dozen of the\nbastards. The babble reminded him of a wedding party held in too small a\nroom, except the guests were panicking and almost all men.\nGeneral Forest barked out orders, trying to impose some sanity. Arch\nLector Pike fingered his melted chin, trying to sift truth from conflicting\nreports. Corporal Tunny watched it all from a folding field chair, the\nSteadfast Standard propped beside him, with an air of knowing amusement\nwhich Orso found particularly aggravating.\n“Your Majesty,” Hoff was wheedling, with his trademark wringing of\nthe hands, “I wish you would consider returning to the Agriont where you\ncan be protected—”\n“Out of the question,” said Orso. “Believe me, Lord Chamberlain, I\nwould much prefer to be in my bed than my saddle, but this rebellion is like\na fire in a distillery. If it is not stamped out at once it will spread. And I have\nto be seen to stamp it out.”\n“So this is all about appearances?” murmured Vick.\n“Being king is all about appearances,” said Orso. “An endless\nperformance with no chance for an encore and for damn sure no applause.\nHildi, you do have my armour, don’t you?”\n“’Course I do,” she grunted, without looking up from the confusion of"

But I plan to damn well look like I might.”\nThere was a crash as a messenger tripped, reeled into a table and sent\nrolled-up maps bouncing about the tent.\n“That is enough!” shouted Orso. “Forest, Pike, Tunny, Teufel and Hoff,\nstay. The rest of you out.” He would not have minded ejecting a couple of\nthose named, but he supposed he needed all the help he could get. “Gorst,\nmake sure we are not disturbed.”\n“Buth—” muttered Hildi around a cord she was gripping in her teeth\nwhile she tried to tie two others together.\n“You, too. Out!”\nHildi shrugged, let go of the ropes, and with a gentle flutter one wall of\nthe tent billowed out and slowly collapsed to the ground. A fitting metaphor\nfor Orso’s campaign so far, he rather thought. He spoke through gritted\nteeth.\n“Let us take one thing at a time. Your Eminence, is there any sign of the\nrebels?”\n“No reliable sightings so far, Your Majesty,” said Pike, “but we have\neyes on every beach, bay and wharf. If Lord Heugen told us the truth, we\nexpect them to land tomorrow.”\n“Any trouble from the Breakers? Move now and they catch us with our\ntrousers well and truly down.”\nPike glanced over at Vick, standing with arms tightly folded. She shook\nher head. “All quiet, Your Majesty,” said Pike. “We struck them a blow at\nValbeck from which they have yet to recover.”\n“I wish I believed it,” said Orso, “but I have a feeling that blow only\nmade them angrier. What about our own forces, Forest?”\n“We have about nine thousand, including the resurrected Crown Prince’s\nDivision.”\n“An excellent decision to raise troops in secret, Your Majesty,” broke in\nHoff. “It may have saved the Union!”\n“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” said Orso.\n“There will be members of the Open Council who have stayed loyal, I’m\nsure of it! I have sent letters demanding their support.”\n“I doubt they’ll be falling over each other to help.”\n“I may have implied that the rebels’ estates would be redistributed to\nloyalists…”\nOrso raised his brows. “Maybe they’ll fall over each other after all.”\n“The King’s Own are converging from all across Midderland.” Forest\nretrieved one of the maps and spread it out upon the righted table. “We\nshould link up with two regiments of foot tomorrow. Then Lord Marshal\nRucksted is bringing four of horse from Keln, but there’s no saying whether\nthey’ll reach us in time.”\n“That cavalry could make all the difference…”\n“We need to prepare, Your Majesty,” said Hoff. “Tread carefully. Play\nfor time. Gather all the troops we can.”\n“But the best moment to strike would be soonest,” growled Forest,\ntracing the wiggly line that was Midderland’s north coast with a thick"

Gather all the troops we can.”\n“But the best moment to strike would be soonest,” growled Forest,\ntracing the wiggly line that was Midderland’s north coast with a thick\nfingertip. “Before they get a foothold. Best we can tell, they’ll be picking up\nallies of their own.”\n“So we need to delay,” said Tunny, “but also move at once.”\nThere was a pause while they all considered that. Orso snorted.\n“Anything else?”\n“The erstwhile Lord Marshal Brint,” said Pike in an emotionless drone.\n“He refuses to corporate.”\nOrso shook his head. “It’s always the last one you expect. I thought the\nman was a rock! Imaginative as a rock, but reliable as one, too. He and my\nfather were old friends.”\n“Nonetheless, he is a traitor. It might be useful to demonstrate our\nresolve—”\n“I bloody hate hangings,” snapped Orso. “Maybe we should demonstrate\nmercy for once.”\n“He has been passing secrets to your enemies for months—”\n“Then he should carry on,” said Vick.\nOrso frowned at her. “He’s under lock and key in the House of\nQuestions. Isn’t he?”\n“Awaiting the king’s justice,” grated out Pike.\nVick shrugged. “Brock doesn’t know that. I could take him a message.”\n“A message saying what?” asked Hoff.\n“Saying the Closed Council have turned against each other. Saying the\nKing’s Own are scattered and distracted and there’ll be no opposition.\nSaying His Majesty has fled for Gurkhul with only his standard bearer for\ncompany.”\n“His standard bearer’s got better sense,” muttered Tunny.\n“Saying whatever you please.”\nOrso considered that idea, and a rare smile began to spread across his\nface. “You know, Inquisitor, I’m beginning to like you a great deal.”\nForest cleared his throat. “Your Majesty, if that’s all, we really\nshould…” And he nodded towards the theoretical entrance to the tent,\nwhere Gorst was holding back a sweaty, panicky, impatient crush of\nmessengers.\nOrso sighed. “Very well. Open the floodgates.”\nAs the boat’s keel ground against gravel, Leo leaped into the surf. Sloshing\nthrough a few dozen strides of icy water probably wasn’t the best thing for\nhis leg, but he was burning to be first ashore. He’d been kept a prisoner\nbehind a desk far too long, caged in ballrooms and council chambers,\nchained by manners and rules. Now was the time for action. And what was\nthe point of a leader, after all, if he didn’t actually lead? Directing things\nfrom a chair at the back was for King Orso and his like, not the Young Lion.\nLeo’s headquarters would be in the saddle. At the tip of the spear. Where the\nblood was shed and the glory won!\nIt wasn’t the most glorious stretch of shore, he had to admit, as his\nflooded boots finally crunched up onto the beach and he stood to rest his\naching leg.

He took a step one way, froze, then turned back\nthe other and hurried off up the beach.\nJin was grinning at Leo, red beard tugged by the wind. “By the dead, it’d\nbe a shame to go home without a battle, though.”\nLeo grinned back and clapped him on his mailed shoulder. “Maybe just\na little one.”\nOrders were being called now, boots splashing in the surf and scraping\nin the shingle, a reassuring clamour of activity as the men of Angland began\nto pour from the boats and onto the beach.\nLeo’s standard was unfurled above him, the crossed hammers and the\nlion, holed and torn from victories in the North but never taken by an\nenemy.

Riding\nwhile heavily pregnant at the head of a military campaign mired by foul\nweather proved to be in that latter category.\nHer thighs burned with the effort. Her clothes were soaked through and\nchafing. Her hands were so swollen, she had split one riding glove and\ncould hardly feel the reins. Her stomach was sending painful washes of acid\nup her throat with every jolt of her horse. If she hunched over against the\nrain, her great beer keg of a belly felt like it would make her aching ribs\nspring open. If she sat up, she got the storm full in her face and every step\nher horse took stabbed her in the spine. And then, in any and every position\ninto which a heavily pregnant human body could be twisted, there was the\nendlessly throbbing focus of misery that was her bladder. Probably no one\nwould have noticed had she pissed herself, she could hardly have been\nwetter. Probably she was pissing herself, an agonising slow leak with every\nin-breath. When she first became pregnant, she had been pathetically\ngrateful to be free of the menses for a few months. Now it seemed she had\ntraded the monthly agonies for constant ones.\nAs if to add insult to injury, her husband grinned into the elements, rain\ncoursing down his face, never happier than when he had a simple physical\nobstacle to manfully wrestle with and heroically overcome. “Can’t let a bit\nof weather stop us!” he roared over the wind as he slapped a baffled\nmessenger on the back and sent him to find formations that for all they\nknew had been washed away into the sea. “Used to Northern storms, aren’t\nwe?” he called to a column of bedraggled Anglanders, raising a limp cheer.\n“We can manage a Midderland drizzle!”\n“A drizzle,” snarled Savine over her shoulder at Zuri, wishing she had\ntaken the carriage when it was offered.\n“God punished old Sippot’s arrogance with a flood,” called Zuri, soaked\nto the perfect skin herself but facing the weather with her usual equanimity.\n“Perhaps He means to do the same to us.”\nThere was a flash on the horizon, claws of trees caught black against the\nbrightness.

Savine’s own mount\ntrembled, shuffled fearfully sideways, and she shushed in its ear, patted its\nneck, stroked her belly, trying to calm her struggling horse and her kicking\nbaby and the rampaging storm all at once and wondering who the hell\nwould calm her.\nShe flinched as Antaup spurred his horse up from behind in a shower of\nmud.\n“No sign of Rikke?” snapped Leo.\n“No sign!”\n“What the hell’s happened to her?”\n“If her boats were caught in weather like this she could be anywhere.”\n“At the bottom of the sea, maybe,” grunted Jin, peering up grimly at the\nstreaming skies.\n“If this rain gets any heavier,” growled Savine, trying to unstick her\nclammy dress from her shoulders under the weight of her waterlogged\ncloak, “the bottom of the sea will come to us.”\nThey picked their way around the boggy margins of a vast puddle in the\nroad. One could have described it as a lake without fear of contradiction,\nmen squatting on an upended cart at one side like shipwrecked mariners, all\nmanner of gear floating on the rain-pricked water while others waded past,\nweapons over their heads, or tried to force their way through the hedges to\neither side.\n“This way!” They were led past a miserable huddle of men under a tarp\nand out across a darkened field. It felt good for a moment to move faster\nthan a crawl, even if Savine had no idea where they were moving to. Then\nshe saw flickering lights up ahead, dark shapes moving in the twilight.\n“Riders!” hissed Antaup, ripping his spear from its case. Panic rippled\nthrough the knot of officers. Steel scraped as swords were drawn, shields\nunslung. Savine’s horse was barged by another and she only just clung on to\nthe saddle, wrenching her arm. She stared, heart in her mouth, one hand\ngripping the reins like death, the other wrapped protectively around her\nbelly.\n“Who goes there?” Jin roared into the night, standing in his stirrups with\nhis great mace ready.\n“Lord Isher!” came a strangled shout. “And you?”\nThere was a collective gasp as men sagged in their saddles. “It’s the\nYoung Lion!” called Leo, reassuring laughter in his voice. “No need to piss\nyourselves!”\n“So you say,” grunted Savine, squirming in her saddle.\n“Thank the Fates!” Riders came smiling into the flickering light cast by\nthe torches of Leo’s guards. “We thought you might be the king’s men.”\n“Likewise.” Leo grinned hugely as he leaned from his saddle to clasp\nIsher’s hand.\nThe sight of their ally gave Savine far less comfort than she might have\nhoped. He had none of the self-assurance he radiated while stirring trouble\nin the Open Council, or discussing how they would divide the spoils in\nOstenhorm. He looked gaunt and jumpy, his uniform a poor fit under his\nsoaked oilskin, his white hair rain-flattened to a dirty grey but for one\nabsurd tweak which stuck up like a peacock’s crest."

Savine didn’t recognise him and no one seemed in\nthe mood for introductions, least of all her.\n“Lady Wetterlant’s with us,” said Isher, eyes narrowed against a sudden\ngust, “but her troops are strung out along five miles of boggy track and their\nsupplies five miles behind that! Have the Northmen landed?”\n“Most of ’em,” called Jin. “Stour’s somewhere to the east but half his\nboats drifted. In this weather, who knows where they’ll wash up?”\n“Bloody beaches are a bloody shambles, too,” grunted Antaup.\n“Is Heugen with you?” asked Leo.\nIsher’s unhappy horse kept trying to turn around. Savine sympathised.\nHe bad-temperedly jerked it back. “You haven’t heard from him?”\n“No, but we can’t wait. We have to push on, whatever the weather. We\ncan’t give Orso any time to gather his forces!”\nThey clattered through the gate of a low farmhouse, mean wooden\nbuildings around a yard of rain-hammered mud, wind thrashing at the trees.\nA dog ran wild, barking at the horses, and a soldier hissed curses as he\nkicked it away. Savine peeled herself from the saddle and Jin helped her\ndown. A family watched from under the dripping eaves of a barn,\npresumably the unfortunate owners of the place, as dozens of soldiers,\nwagons and one heavily pregnant woman crowded into their churned-up\nfarmyard. Probably Savine should have felt sorry for them, but her pity was\nsoluble in heavy rain, apparently, and what she had left she needed for\nherself.\nThe low-ceilinged front parlour of the house swarmed with men in\nmismatched uniforms, all gabbling at once, the windows misty with their\nbreath. Antaup had dragged a table into the middle of the room and upended\na case of damp maps onto it, rooting through them with the expression of a\nman trying to solve a riddle in a language he did not speak.\n“Damn it!” Leo held one up to the inadequate lamplight, set flickering as\nsomeone shoved the door wide and wind whipped through the room. “Can\nwe get a decent light in here? Is this map accurate?”\n“None of them are bloody accurate—”\n“Do we know where the king’s forces are?” grumbled Lord Mustred,\nrain dripping from his bedraggled eyebrows.\n“I heard two days’ march away.”\n“What? We were told he was fleeing south!”\nSavine winced. In business, few things went entirely to plan. In war,\nplans and reality barely noticed each other in passing.

Oceans of misinformation hiding infinitesimal grains of\ntruth. Savine was used to taking charge, but how could anyone take charge\nof this? Especially someone who could scarcely control her own bladder.\nNot for the first time, Savine wished Jurand was with them. He was the\nonly one of Leo’s friends who could really organise, who had an eye for the\ndetails, who thought less about what he wanted to do and more about what\nhad to be done. The man was like a wagon’s axle. You paid little mind to it\nwhen it was there, but take it away and things plunged rapidly off the road.\nThe door banged open and another cold draught swept in. A man shook\nwater from a fur-trimmed cloak, huffing and blowing. An old white-haired\nNorthman, with gold on his mail and rain in his beard and broken veins on\nhis bulbous nose.\nHe looked about, realising all the soldiers had stopped their business to\nlook at him, and nervously cleared his throat. “Nice evening for it.”\n“Hardbread!” said Leo, grabbing the old warrior by the hand and giving\nit a shake fit to tear his arm off. “At last! Where’s Rikke?”\n“Still in Uffrith.”\n“What?”\n“Well, she was when I left. She should’ve left herself by now. Be here\nsoon, I guess. There was a storm. Boats couldn’t leave the harbour. Good\nthing it didn’t come an hour later or we might’ve all drowned.”\nLeo had lurched from the heights of relief to the depths of\ndisappointment without taking a breath. “How many men did you bring?”\n“For now, just the ones rowed me here. ’Bout thirty?”\n“Thirty?” A shocked mutter ran around the room. An officer from\nAngland and one of the noblemen’s retainers had begun shouting at one\nanother. A punch was thrown, they wrestled, barged the table, bellowing\ninsults. Jin grabbed them around their necks and bundled the pair of them\nout into the night. The clamour and the panic and the wild eyes reminded\nSavine too much of Valbeck. She felt that horribly familiar sour taste, the\ngorge rising in her throat, her heart thudding and her head spinning as she\nbacked into the shadows, wondering if among all these half-glimpsed faces\nshe could see the men who had chased her through the streets—\n“Are you all right?” asked Zuri, taking her gently by the elbow.\n“Never mind Rikke,” Savine forced through her gritted teeth. “Just find\nme a fucking bucket.”\n“This way,” said Zuri, slipping through the madness to a side door.\nSavine shuffled after her, one hand pressed into her back and the other\nunder her swollen belly, into a little kitchen on the side of the building with\na time-blackened fireplace and a smell of bad cooking. She pushed the door\nshut and leaned back on it, tried to ignore the mad babble of raised voices\nfrom beyond, fix on the rattling of the ill-fitting window, the steady drip-\ndrip of water from a leak."

When\nshe heard the metallic spattering, she almost cried with relief. She\nshuddered at the last trickle, tried to bend down to fish up her drawers\nbetween two fingers, but could not quite reach.\n“Hell,” she gasped, legs trembling with the effort. In the end, she had to\nstand before she fell, let Zuri drag her rain-sodden skirts out of the way and\npull them up for her.\nShe flopped back exhausted onto a stool with a flapping of muddy cloth,\nshoulders against the damp plaster, boots stretched out wide in front of her.\n“So much for leading an army. I can hardly get my drawers up without\nhelp.”\n“A good thing for your reputation as a general that I am here,” said Zuri.\n“Rabik and Haroon should be along soon with dry clothes and dinner.”\nSavine shut her eyes, tears of gratitude prickling the lids. “What the hell\nwould I do without your family? I’ve no idea how you can stay so calm.”\n“I was not always a lady’s companion. I have seen my share of storms.”\nZuri frowned off into the corner of the room, as though bad memories\nlurked there. “They pass, in time.”\n“If the lightning doesn’t find you out,” muttered Savine, giving Zuri’s\nhand a squeeze.\nThe door rattled at a thudding knock, and she gritted her teeth and\nworked her way into a slightly more presentable position, bladder aching\nagain already. “Yes?”\nThe door wobbled open and someone dipped his head under the low\nlintel.\n“Broad!” The name almost came as a gasp of relief. Here was a man she\nhad seen deal with a crisis. A rock to cling to in a storm.\n“Lady Savine.” He frowned down at her, eye-lenses dotted with beads of\nrain and an ugly scab on one side of his head. “Are you all right—”\n“I should not have ridden and it should not have rained. Tell me you\nhave some good news!”\nHe did not look like a man with good news, it had to be said. Even in\nValbeck, during the uprising, even when things got bad, he had always\nseemed hopeful, at least. Now he looked grim. Brows wrinkled, fists\nclenched. For a moment, the sight of him, scabbed head nearly brushing the\nlow ceiling, gave Savine the slightest twinge of fear. An echo of the terror\nwhen she first saw his great silhouette on the barricade in Valbeck.\n“The Breakers’ll join us,” he said, after a pause. “And the Burners."

Aiming for uprisings all across the\nUnion on the last day of summer.”\n“They should already be underway,” murmured Zuri.\n“That could make all the difference.” Savine closed her eyes and\nbreathed a long sigh. “If they can pin down the King’s Own, stop\nreinforcements arriving, we might not need to fight at all.” She hoped, she\nprayed, they did not need to fight at all. “Who did you deal with? Risinau?”\n“No.” Broad took off his lenses to wipe them on a corner of his shirt.\nSavine got the feeling it was definitely bad news this time. “Judge.”\n“The woman who hanged all those people in Valbeck?”\nBroad winced, mouth open, as though wondering how much to say. In\nthe end, all he said was, “That’s her.”\nSavine felt another surge of panic, slipped the box out of her sleeve and\ninto her trembling hand, snapped it open. Water had got inside, the pearl\ndust made useless paste. “Damn it!” she snarled, flinging it against the wall.\nRight away she felt foolish. “Sorry. Not very graceful.”\n“These aren’t very graceful times.”\n“Can this woman Judge be trusted?”\n“I’d sooner trust a scorpion,” said Broad, hooking his lenses around his\nears again.\n“We’ll just have to hope for the best.” Savine gave a little gasp as her\nbaby shifted, put a calming hand on her stomach. “Is war always like this?”\n“It’s when the enemy arrives things really turn to shit, begging your\npardon.”\n“Let’s hope they never arrive, then,” said Savine.\n“Hope can’t hurt.” But Broad gave the strong impression that he did not\nthink it would help much, either.\n“Could you tell His Grace what you’ve told me?”\n“Aye. If I can get a word in.”\nSavine waved Zuri over. “I fear I need my bucket again.”\nLiar, Liar\n“L\nord Governor Brock’s headquarters?” asked Vick, sitting easy in her\nsaddle but with an expression that said she’d no time for nonsense.\nThe corporal barely looked up from his sizzling pan, just waved her on.\nOne of the soldiers gave her a weak smile, then went back to scraping mud\nfrom a boot. None of them challenged her as she nudged her horse past, but\nthat was no surprise.\nShe’d always been the best liar she knew.\nFrom as early as she could remember, little Victarine dan Teufel, doted-\nupon youngest daughter of the Master of the Mints, had known she didn’t\nfeel things quite the way other people did.

How animated she is! Her feelings are written on her face, poor\nthing.\nThen one day she broke a treasured vase, and blamed her brother, and\nmaintained a perfect air of baffled innocence while he turned red and angry.\nHer mother punished him for her crime, and made him apologise to her for\nlying into the bargain, and gave her a slice of fruit tart as a reward. So little\nVictarine learned early what the truth is worth. Good lying isn’t so much\nabout what you say as how you say it. Amazing how far you can get if you\nstick to a straight line and look like you’ve got every reason to be there.\nSo Vick crossed muddy fields choked with rebels and ruined tents, not\nskulking on the margins, but trotting through the midst of the slimy chaos,\neyes ahead. She tutted in disgust as two soldiers argued over a canteen. She\nhissed impatiently at a crowd trying to shift a mired wagon. She ordered a\nwhole queue of bedraggled men outside a slumping soup-tent to get out of\nher way and made them grumpily shuffle aside.\nShe’d always been the best liar she knew. But like anyone who wants to\ntruly master a skill, young Victarine dan Teufel had built on natural talent\nwith painstaking practice.\nShe’d made herself a student of behaviour. Noted giveaway twitches of\nthe eyes, telltale movements of the hands, observed them in others,\nsuppressed them in herself. She’d practised on the servants, then on her\nfamily, then on the powerful men her father met with. She’d learned to keep\nalways as close as she could to the truth. To shape her lies to her audience\nlike a key to a lock. To shape herself. Not only to tell them what they\nwanted to hear, but to be who they wanted to hear it from.\nShe would be dealing with nobility today, so she became nobility,\nshoulders confidently back, chin proudly raised. She was Victarine, with the\nbig “dan” in her name and disinterested scorn for anyone without it. She’d\npinned her hair up. A plain dealer, hiding nothing. On reflection, she pulled\na few strands free for a softening touch. Simple clothes, but not cheap.\nShe’d decided a skirt was pushing it, but she’d opened one more button of\nher shirt than usual, rolled the sleeves once to show her wrists. Unguarded.\nEven a little vulnerable. Finally, she’d made Tallow flick her with road\nmuck. She had been riding hard on a vital mission, after all.\n“Who goes there?” snapped a sergeant, pointing a polearm and a\nbelligerent expression.\nHe was guarding the gates of a fine old manor house which, judging by\nthe lion-and-hammers standard planted in the churned-up ornamental\ngardens, Brock had commandeered for his headquarters. She sized the man\nup at a glance. Moustache waxed and breastplate polished even in the midst\nof this mess.

A self-important stickler who took himself far too seriously.\n“My name is Victarine dan Teufel.” In the smooth, clear noblewoman’s\naccent her mother used to have. “I need to speak to Lord Governor Brock.”\nHe frowned up, looking for something to distrust, but she gave him\nnothing.\n“You could be a spy,” he said, grudgingly.\n“I am a spy.”\nHe stared at her, caught off guard.\n“On your side.” She leaned down, glancing left and right, using an\nurgent whisper, as if she’d picked him and only him to trust with a secret.\n“And I have a message from Lord Marshal Brint that could change\neverything.”\nImportant news, for the important man. He puffed himself up, turned\nfrowning to the busy yard. “Clear a path there! This woman needs to see the\nLord Governor!”\nShe’d always been the best liar she knew. Then the Practicals dragged\nher from her bed in the night, and her family was sent to the camps in\nAngland. Young Victarine dan Teufel had buried her fancy name in a\nshallow grave and become just Vick, and lying had gone from a game to a\nmeans of survival. In the years she’d spent in that freezing hell, as her\nfamily died one by one, she’d only told the whole truth once, and that was\nthe day she got out. She’d hammered her face into a vizor of blank\nindifference that no shock, no pain, no terror could dent.\nWhich proved to be a very good thing as she was shown into Leo dan\nBrock’s borrowed dining room. From what she’d heard, he was one of those\nvain men of action who can’t wait to believe what they want to. But he\nwasn’t eating breakfast alone. Standing nearby, big hands clasped, looking\nmightily surprised to see her wander in out of the muddy morning, was her\nold comrade from the Breakers, Gunnar Broad. Worse yet, sitting on the\nother side of the table was the heavily pregnant daughter of Vick’s previous\nemployer, Savine dan Brock.\nWhat Vick thought was, Shit. What her expression said was, Good,\nyou’re all here.\n“Victarine dan Teufel.” Savine’s face might have been softened by her\ncondition but her smile had a harder, hungrier edge than ever. “Unless I’m\nmuch mistaken.”\nBroad’s heavy brows knitted with suspicion. “The two o’ you know each\nother?”\nWhile Vick tried to plot a safe path through the swamp of truths and\nfalsehoods these three knew about her, she met one question with another.\n“The two of you know each other?”\n“Master Broad saved my life during the uprising in Valbeck,” said\nSavine. “And I shared the carriage there with Inquisitor Teufel.”\n“Inquisitor?” Broad’s wide eyes looked strangely small through his\nlenses. “Thought you grew up in the camps?”\n“I did. But Arch Lector Glokta offered me a way out.” Vick met Broad’s\neye and told all the truth she could. “Bringing the Breakers to justice.”\n“You were working for Old Sticks all that time?”\n“My father once described Inquisitor Teufel as his most loyal servant.”\nSavine sipped delicately from a teacup, but the stare she gave Vick over the"

She knew it was one of those moments when her life\nhung by a thread. But it was hardly her first.\n“Everyone’s loyalties are a touch tangled these days.” She hooked out\nthe chair at the head of the table with her foot and dropped into it, meeting\nSavine’s eye. “I like to think I never let your father down. He got me out of\nthe camps. I owed him. But he’s gone now.”\nA flicker of doubt crossed Savine’s well-powdered face. “Gone?”\nShe didn’t know. That was useful. A surprise might put her off balance.\n“Your father had to resign. Once news got out of this little… escapade.\nRetired to his country estates to write a book about fencing. Your mother\nthought the air would be good for his health. Or that’s what she said she\nthought.” It rang true because it was true, and Vick took a fork and leaned\nacross to spear a sausage from a dish. “It’s Arch Lector Pike, now.”\nShe noticed the muscles squirm in Broad’s jaw. Saw his big fists tighten\nfurther. That was useful, too. His anger and Savine’s guilt could keep them\ndistracted, while Vick swaggered past in plain sight.\n“I owed your father,” she said, “but I don’t owe Pike a thing. Lord\nMarshal Brint needed someone to carry a message. Someone who could slip\nthrough the lines. Someone comfortable with a lie or two.” She waved\ntowards the window with her fork. “Judging by all the men I passed on the\nway here, we may have a change in government soon enough.” She bit into\nthe sausage and smiled as she chewed. “If I learned one thing in the camps,\nit’s always eat when food’s on offer. But if I learned another, it’s that you\nstand with the winners.”\nShe was bringing them round, she could feel it. And once you’ve got\nsomeone to believe, it takes a jolt to shift them. Accepting you swallowed a\nlie means accepting you’re a fool, after all. Who wants to think that?\n“You’re right to be suspicious, though,” she said. “There’s a hell of a lot\nat stake. That’s why the lord marshal gave me this.” And she twisted Brint’s\nring from her finger and tossed it into the dish with the sausages.\nSavine held it frowning to the light, with the air of a woman who’s\nassessed a lot of jewellery. “It’s a lady’s ring.”\n“He said it belonged to his wife. The one lost at the Battle of Osrung.”\nThere’s nothing like a prop to shore up a lie. Something you can touch.\nSomething with a story. Even if, when you really thought about it, she\ncould’ve stolen it from a one-armed man in a bathhouse."

Lies they could build all their plans out of. Lies that’d\ncrumble as soon as any weight was put on them. “Orso is marching against\nyou with every man he can find, but he can’t find many. He’s sent for the\nKing’s Own, but they’re scattered across the Union, and Brint stopped most\nof the orders going out. The Closed Council were taken by surprise, are off\nbalance and all looking to save themselves. There’s no help coming to the\nking. No friends and no reinforcements.” As she spoke, the smile spread\nacross Brock’s face, and she knew she had him. “What are your numbers?”\n“Perhaps twenty thousand,” he breathed. “There are still men coming\nin.”\nWorse than she’d feared. The rebels might outnumber the loyalists two\nto one. She smiled as though it was better than she’d hoped. “You might\noutnumber him four to one.”\nLeo dan Brock eagerly clenched his fist. “We have him.”\n“Take nothing for granted,” said Savine, but Vick caught the relief in her\nvoice, the flush of triumph on her cheek. The look of a gambler who has\ngone all in, then been dealt the final card of a winning hand. Lady Brock\nwas a formidable liar herself, of course. Used to flipping investors about her\nknuckles like a magician flips a coin. But she was nowhere near as good as\nshe thought she was.\nVick had been staking her life on her lies for years. She’d tricked\nRisinau and his people, tricked Sibalt and his people, tricked Solumeo\nShudra in Westport, even tricked the Minister of Whispers herself, for a few\ndays, all while death breathed on her neck. She popped the last bit of\nsausage in her mouth.\n“Lord Marshal Brint asked me to bring a message back. He needs to\nknow your plans.” And she held out her hand for his ring. “What shall I tell\nhim?”\nYou Asked for Killers\n“W\nell, here’s a mess,” said Clover, wearily puffing out his cheeks.\n“Just went wrong, is all.” Dancer knelt in the muddy yard with wrists\ntied behind him to his ankles. Not the most comfortable position, but he’d\nno one else to blame. His fat friend was similarly tied but he’d got knocked\nover when Downside slapped him and couldn’t find a way to wriggle back\nto his knees, or maybe he’d thought better of trying. Now he was sobbing\naway softly on his side, one pink cheek caked in muck and the other\nstreaked with tears. Flick, meanwhile, was being sick behind the shed.

Wrong?”\n“We just wanted the sheep!” One of ’em bleated from the pen, as if to\nlend support to that part of Dancer’s story if no other. “We even asked\nnicely.”\nClover rubbed at his temples. Had a bit of a headache. Thinking about it,\nhe’d had a headache for weeks. “If those sheep were all you had in the\nworld, would asking nicely get you to hand ’em over?”\n“Would if this was the alternative,” said Sholla softly, squatting beside\nthe old man. He was sat against the tumbledown wall with his head back\nlike he was sleeping. Except for the arrow in his ribs and his shirt below it\nsoggy black with blood, of course.\n“We asked nicely,” whined Dancer. “Then we asked less nicely. Think\nwe did, anyway, you know, the language ain’t my strong point.”\n“Remind me what your strong point is, again?” asked Clover.\n“Then the old man comes out with an axe so Prettyboy shot him.”\nPrettyboy must’ve been named by a real wag since he was, by any\nstandard, a thoroughly ugly man. “Just pointed the bow,” he said, shifting\nawkwardly on his knees. Everything’s awkward when your hands are tied to\nyour ankles, to be fair. The bow in question lay in the mud not far away, and\nhe gave it a filthy look like it was to blame for the whole business. “But I\nfumbled the string, you know, and shot him.”\n“Then the woman set to screaming and, well…” Dancer winced down at\nthe mud. “It went wrong, is all. You never had anything go wrong, Clover?”\nClover wearily puffed out his cheeks again. “I’ve barely had anything go\nright.” A scene like this didn’t make him feel sick any more, or angry, or\neven sad. Just tired. Maybe that’s when you know you’ve been in the\nbloody business too long, when tragedies start to feel like chores. When\nsome poor bastard’s end of everything becomes your minor pain in the arse.\n“Could you shut up?” he asked the fat one, and the man cut his sobbing\nback to snivelling, which if anything was worse.\nClover pronounced every word with care. “It’s ’cause it can all go wrong\nso easily that you make every effort to be sure it goes right. Like not being\ndrunk. And not drawing your bloody bow till you want to shoot. And\nknowing who you’re dealing with and where they are, so an old man with\nan axe comes as no surprise. That type o’ thing!” He’d ended up shouting,\nand he winced and rubbed at his head, and forced his voice soft again. “The\nway you came blundering at this, it’s a wonder you didn’t kill each other\ninto the bargain.”\n“Shame they didn’t,” grunted Downside. “Would’ve saved us some\nfucking trouble.”"

Even Dancer couldn’t disagree. “Aye, you’re\nright,” he said, “I know you’re right, Clover. But you bring warriors to a\nplace like this, it’s the type o’ thing that happens.”\n“Shit warriors, maybe,” said Sholla, picking her nose.\nDancer shuffled closer on his knees. Not dancing much with his hands\ntied to his feet, of course. He looked up, big eyes, little voice, wheedle,\nwheedle. “No chance we could let it go?”\nIf there had been a time when Clover was impressed by wheedling, it\nwas far in the past. “Not up to me, is it? If Stour lets it go, I guess it’s\ngone.”\nDancer’s smile withered like blooms in late summer, and he gave a\nswallow that made a glug, and the fat one let his face drop in the muck and\nset to sobbing again. Everyone knew by now. Stour Nightfall’s mercy was a\nthin thread to hang all your hopes on.\n“Just went wrong, is all,” muttered Dancer, and Prettyboy struggled to\nscratch his ear with his shoulder, and failed.\nBy then they could hear hooves, and the King of the Northmen\nwrenched his horse around the side of the barn, Greenway and a dozen of\nhis bastards in a jostling crowd behind. Stour reined in savagely, of course,\nsince there’s no finer sport than mistreating the beast who carries you. He\npropped his arms crosswise on the saddle horn so his great chain with its\ngreat diamond brushed his wrists, and glowered at the burned-out house,\nand the yard strewn with rubbish, and the corpses, and the prisoners with\nwrists and ankles closely attached, and Clover and his people stood around\nthem with weapons out. He slowly licked the inside of his mouth until he’d\ngathered what he wanted, then spat it spinning into the mud.\n“Well, here’s a mess.”\nDancer kept his eyes on the ground. “Just went wrong.”\n“You fucking think?” snarled the Great Wolf, as Greenway and the rest\nof his men spread out, looking down their noses at the scene with varying\nmeasures of contempt. “Is he crying? Is he fucking simple or something?\nGet this cleared up, Clover, before… Oh, that’s perfect.”\nAnd who should burst from the trees but the Young Lion and a crowd of\nhis bastards. They reined in so Stour and his lot were sneering bitter scorn\nfrom one side of the yard, Brock and his lot scowling righteous outrage on\nthe other. Seemed the Young Lion hadn’t reached the point where tragedies\nbecame chores. If anything, he tended towards too much feeling.\n“What the hell happened?” he growled.\nThere was an awkward silence, which Clover for some reason felt the\nneed to fill. What he really wanted to say was that if you don’t like dead\nfolk you shouldn’t start wars, but the best he could think of was, “I’m told it\nwent wrong.” He’d thought when Dancer said it nothing could’ve sounded"

        "text": "folk you shouldn’t start wars, but the best he could think of was, “I’m told it\nwent wrong.” He’d thought when Dancer said it nothing could’ve sounded\nworse, but somehow he managed it.\n“So I see!” The Young Lion spurred his snorting warhorse across the\nfarmyard till it loomed over Clover and his kneeling prisoners. “Is this your\nidea of best behaviour?” he snapped at Stour, pointing to the face-down\ncorpse with the yawning sword-cut across his back.\nThe Great Wolf was not to be outdone on the bristling, threatening or\nnursing of offence. “You’re taking a high hand with me, Young Lion!” And\nhe nudged his own horse forward till Clover had to squint up at him. “You\nasked for killers. As many as I could find. You wanted dogs off the leash in\nyour own backyard. I warned you they might run after rabbits.”\n“Rabbits would be one thing.” Brock kicked his horse even closer to\nStour and Clover had to duck away lest he be squashed between the two\nheroes. “Red-handed murder of Union citizens is another! Was it these\nbastards who did it?” he snarled at the trussed-up men, and they cringed, or\nwriggled, and the fat one blubbed into the mud, and Prettyboy moved his\nlips as he offered up some prayer to the dead which Clover very much\ndoubted would help.\n“Last I checked, I was King o’ the Northmen.” Stour leaned towards\nBrock with that mad gleam in his wet eyes, catching hold of his chain and\ngiving it a shake so the diamond he’d torn from his uncle’s cut throat\ndanced. “These fuckers are Northmen. So I’ll say what’s done with ’em.”\nFor a moment, it looked like the Young Lion might grab the Great Wolf\nand they’d wrestle their way down from their saddles and set to an ugly\nrematch of their duel right there in the corpse-scattered farmyard. Then,\nlooking like it took quite the effort, Brock got a grip on himself. He\nbreathed in through manfully clenched teeth and leaned back. “You’re King\nof the Northmen.” With a jerk on his reins, he pulled his horse away from\nStour’s. “But this is the Union. I expect to see justice done.”\n“Trust me, Young Lion,” snarled Stour, looking as untrustworthy as any\nman ever. “I’m all about the justice.”\nBrock wrenched his mount around and led his glaring bastards back into\nthe trees at a brisk trot. Clover slowly breathed out. Sholla, who’d had a\ncautious hand wrapped around the grip of a knife in the back of her belt,\nleaned to his ear to whisper, “Seems the lion and the wolf ain’t getting on.”\n“’Twas always a doomed romance,” said Clover, under his breath.\n“Dogs and cats, you know…”\n“Thanks, my king,” croaked out Dancer. “You saved our—”\nStour gave him a little smile. “You’re fucking joking, aren’t you? I came\nhere to fight, not stand judge over your folly. Get these idiots killed,\nClover.”\n“Me?”\n“I’m giving orders. It’s what kings do.”"

It’s what kings do.”\nHis turn to wrench his horse around and ride off, showering everyone\nwith dirt. Dancer stared at the ground. Prettyboy frowned bitterly at his\nbow. The fat one set to sobbing again. The corpses, naturally, were\nunmoved.\n“That was a lot o’ bluster,” grumbled Downside, “just to end where we\nstarted.”\n“Aye, well, that’s life,” said Clover. “From mud we come, to mud we\nshall return. Every one of us.”\nSholla raised a brow. “Message o’ hope, then?”\n“Messages o’ hope would be inappropriate at an execution. Downside,\nget these idiots killed.”\n“Me?” grunted Downside, looking somewhat put out.\n“I’m giving orders,” said Clover, turning away. “You can get Flick to\nhelp you with the burying. And best take those sheep with us, Sholla. Folk\nneed to eat.”\nDancer was still staring at the mud as Downside pulled his axe out. “Just\nwent wrong,” he said, shaking his head. “That’s all.”\nGood Ground\n“G\nood ground,” said Forest approvingly as they rode down the gentle\nslope.\nStoffenbeck nestled in a valley beside a sparkling river, a re-assuringly\nold and solid little town of seasoned Midderland stone. Sheep lazily\ncropped grass in the pastures, the waterwheel of an ancient mill gently\nturned, soothing smoke drifted from the ornamental chimneys which were\nsuch a feature of the local architecture. It would have made a fine study for\none of those nostalgic painters who turned out the good old days in bulk.\n“The best ground.” Orso took a satisfied noseful of the sweet country air.\n“Absolutely charming.”\n“I… meant for a battle, Your Majesty.”\n“Oh.” The thought of red-toothed war descending on the sleepy scene\nwas far from pleasant. But then war never is pleasant to contemplate, once\nit comes to specific homes to be ruined, specific people to be slaughtered.\nNot to mention specific kings to be toppled. “Yes, of course. Good ground.”\nA gentle green hill with a few trees at the crown overlooked the town on\nthe right. Perhaps it would have been more military to say east. Or was it\nwest? For some reason north and south were instinctive, but the other points\nof the compass always took a moment for Orso to work through. On the left\nof the town, across the river, there was a steeper hill studded with rocky\noutcrops. A bluff, might a surveyor have called it?\n“Good ground,” said Forest again, his scar puckering as he allowed\nhimself the smallest smile. As if smiles were being strictly rationed and that\nwas all they could spare.\n“Hills.” Orso did his best to copy Forest’s discerning expression. “Hills\nare good.”\n“Hills are bloody marvellous, Your Majesty. If you get up ’em first.\n’Course, to hold them, we could use more men…”\n“Reinforcements are on the way.” Orso tried to make sure his voice\nbetrayed no quaverings of doubt."

        "text": "’Course, to hold them, we could use more men…”\n“Reinforcements are on the way.” Orso tried to make sure his voice\nbetrayed no quaverings of doubt.\n“The question is,” murmured Tunny, from behind, “will they get here\nbefore we’re all killed?”\nA small crowd in feast-day clothes was arranged in the square at\nStoffenbeck’s heart. Bunting fluttered about a singularly ugly old building\nwith an absurdly tall clock tower, presumably the town hall.\n“Go, then!” snapped a portly man with a chain of office, and a boy\nraised a polished trumpet and blew a salute, lacking tune but compensating\nwith sheer volume.\n“Oh dear,” muttered Orso. “You don’t suppose they’ve turned out for\nme?”\nTunny raised one brow. “Well, I don’t suppose they’ve turned out for\nme.”\n“Your August Majesty!” gushed the mayor as Orso’s party approached,\ncollapsing in a bow so low his chain of office feathered the cobbles. “I\ncannot find the words to describe the privilege of hosting you! The honour\nfor me and the entire town of Stoffenbeck is quite indescribable.”\n“Not at all, my dear sir, yours is a delightful burg.” Orso gestured\ntowards the buildings about the square. Several fine old houses, a guildhall\nwith a marble façade, a tavern with a half-timbered upper floor, a covered\nmarketplace with its sagging roof held up on squat pillars. Progress had\nlargely left this corner of the Union alone, it could barely have changed in\ntwo centuries. “The very quintessence of rural Midderland! In happier times\nI would delight in a tour, but I hope you will forgive me…” Orso tipped his\ncirclet towards the ladies and gentlemen and kept his horse moving ever so\ngently northwards. Stop for one moment, and they have you. “Rebellions\ndon’t crush themselves, you know!”\n“Of course, Your Majesty!” The mayor took a few shuffling steps after\nhim. “If there is anything you need, you have only to ask. Anything at all!”\n“Ten thousand soldiers and an accurate weather forecast?” muttered\nOrso, under his breath.\n“The honour is quite indescribable.” Tunny mimicked the mayor’s\ndelivery with uncanny accuracy.\n“Believe it or not, there are still people in the world not yet sick of the\nsight of me.”\n“I wonder if he’ll reckon it such a privilege when his town hosts one of\nthe largest battles ever fought on Union soil.”\n“My dear Corporal Tunny, you underestimate the sycophancy of the\nstout Midderland burgher. My guess is he will still be happily genuflecting\nwhen arrows darken the sky…”\nJokes made him feel a little better, especially ones in poor taste, but they\nseemed rather foolish in light of the spectacle as they emerged from the\ntown. There must have been thousands of men working furiously in the\nfields to the north. Men of the Crown Prince’s Division, fortifying a great\ncrescent between the gentle hill and the steep bluff, sharpening stakes,\nshoring up walls, throwing up barricades, digging trenches and pits.\nOverseeing the work with the same total lack of emotion with which he"

I find men rarely work with such tireless\ndedication as when their lives depend on the results.”\nOn their left, the river drained into boggy shallows and was met by\nanother stream with orchards planted on both banks. Over to the right, fields\nthick with ripe spring wheat sloped gently away towards woodland. In the\ncentre, straight ahead, the crops had just been harvested, a patchwork of\nstubbled fields turned rich brown by the recent rains. A great cloud of\nstarlings twisted in the sky, pouring down into the trees around a farm a\nmile or two away, then whirling up into the haze again.\nOrso swallowed. There seemed to be something of a lump in his throat.\n“So this will be our battlefield.”\n“I doubt we’ll find a better,” said Forest.\nOrso shaded his eyes, peering north towards a single hill on the far side\nof the fields, a building jutting from its summit.\n“What’s that tower there?”\n“An old fortified manor house,” said Pike. “Belongs to a Lord Steebling.\nMinor nobility.”\n“Bad luck for him,” murmured Orso. He thought he caught the twinkle\nof steel. “We have men there? Watching for the enemy, I suppose.”\n“Those are the enemy, Your Majesty.”\n“What?”\n“Their first scouts.” Forest rubbed at his grizzled jaw. “Even with the\nroads in the state they are, their main body should be with us before\nsunset.”\n“Bloody hell…” breathed Orso. That brought it all home, somehow.\nThere they were, rebels fixed on his destruction, with only a few miles of\nflat Midderland earth between them. “When can we expect\nreinforcements?”\n“A detachment just arrived from the Siege School in Ratshoff,” said\nTunny. “They brought twenty-four cannon with them.”\n“Don’t those things have a nasty habit of blowing up?” The flash as\nCurnsbick’s engine exploded was unpleasantly fresh in Orso’s mind.\n“I’m assured these new ones are more reliable…” Though Forest looked\nless than convinced. There had not been much to rely on of late.\n“Three loyal members of the Open Council are a few miles away to the\nwest.” Pike pointed off beyond the orchards. “Lords Stenner, Crant and\nIngenbeck, with perhaps a thousand men between them.”\n“And we expect two regiments of King’s Own from the east.” Forest\nstood in his stirrups and frowned towards the gentle hill, the wind making\nwaves in the long grass on its flanks. “Might get here during the night,\nmaybe the morning. Lord Marshal Rucksted is bringing four more in from\nthe south, mostly cavalry. Forced march from Keln and they’ve a lot of\nground to cover. If we’re lucky and the weather holds, they might get here\nlate tomorrow, but… well…”"

If we’re lucky and the weather holds, they might get here\nlate tomorrow, but… well…”\n“You wouldn’t want to bet a kingdom on it?” ventured Orso, turning at\nthe sound of hooves behind. “Ah, Inquisitor Teufel! So glad you could join\nus.” She did not look very glad to be joining them, but then Orso had never\nseen her look glad about anything. He even found it rather reassuring.\nNegotiation, planning or collapse of a nation, she faced them all with the\nsame flinty resolve. “Did you speak to the Young Lion?”\n“I did,” she said. “And to his wife, Lady Savine.”\n“She’s with him?” He had to cough back a ridiculous desire to ask\nwhether she had looked well.\n“Heavily pregnant but still sharp as a dagger.”\n“What are we calling her?” asked Pike, with a twisting of his burned\nfeatures that might have been a smile. “The Young Lioness?”\nOrso gave an unhappy grunt. An apt name, as it turned out. From what\nhe understood of the species, the males had the big reputations but the\nfemales did all the killing.\n“I told them a tale,” said Vick. “That you’re disorganised and short on\nmen. That Brint has prevented any chance of reinforcements. The Lioness\nhad her doubts, but her husband swallowed it whole, I think.”\n“Excellent work!” said Orso. If they could have been reinforced with\nanother dozen Vick dan Teufels they might have avoided fighting altogether.\n“But… you look less than delighted.”\n“Our rebels have struck a deal with the Breakers. They’re planning\nuprisings across Midderland.”\nAn ugly pause. Orso took it with remarkable fortitude, he thought. Or\nperhaps he had no room to hold any more bad news. Like pouring wine into\na glass already full, it simply flooded over the sides. “Have we heard of any\nuprisings? Any more, I should say…”\n“None,” said Pike, “but…”\nIt was left to Tunny to say what everyone was undoubtedly thinking.\n“The first warning would be when our reinforcements don’t arrive.”\nOrso could not help himself. He burst out in a carefree chuckle. “Well,\nwe can only fight one war at a time, my friends. The Breakers can be\ntomorrow’s problem. Right now, several thousand rebellious noblemen,\ndisgruntled Anglanders and slavering Northmen demand all my attention.”\n“Twenty thousand, according to Brock’s own estimate,” said Vick.\nAnother ugly pause. From the concerned looks on the faces about him,\nOrso gathered that was more than they had hoped. “How many are we?” he\nasked, unable to keep a wheedling note from his voice.\n“As it stands,” said Forest, grimly, “no more than twelve thousand. But\nwe’ve got the ground.”\nA great deal of faith to put in earth. Orso gave a long sigh as he\nconsidered the grassy hill, the gently rising, gently waving fields of wheat\nbefore it. “Lord Marshal Forest, I would like you to command the right\nwing.”\nForest raised his bushy brows. “I’m a general, Your Majesty.”"

Brint’s early retirement has left a seat empty on the Closed\nCouncil, and I can’t think of a better man to sit there. Consider yourself\npromoted.” The way things were going, it might be his last official act.\nForest stared at him, mouth slightly open. “Closed Council…”\n“Congratulations,” said Tunny, punching Forest on the arm. “You should\nget a baton, or something.”\n“Only just got me a general’s jacket.”\n“Well, you’re on your own there,” said Orso. “I can pluck new lord\nmarshals from the air, but jackets cost money.” He frowned over at the\nrocky hill on their left, a few more steep bluffs beyond it. The ground in\nfront of those was more difficult, planted with overgrown orchards and cut\nin half by that swampy tributary of the river. “Our left might be held by a\nsmaller force, I think.”\n“Especially if we place our cannon there,” came Gorst’s piping voice.\nHe coloured faintly as everyone turned towards him. “I… saw them used at\nOsrung.”\n“You’d want a ruthless commander,” said Tunny, considering the hills.\n“Someone who scares our men more than the enemy.”\nAs luck would have it, the perfect man appeared to be within arm’s\nreach. “Arch Lector Pike?” asked Orso. “I believe you have experience on\nthe battlefield?”\n“In my younger days, in Gurkhul and the North,” said Pike. “I also\noversaw the first experiments with cannon in the Far Country.”\n“Then I can think of no one more qualified to take charge of my left\nwing. Could you ensure morale there stays high?” Or at least that the\ndemoralised troops were too scared to run.\nPike inclined his head. “Morale is a speciality of mine, Your Majesty.\nWith your permission, I will begin fortifying the position.”\n“The sooner the better,” said Orso. Forest gave a sharp salute and\nspurred away towards the gentle hill. Pike turned his horse towards the\nsteeper bluffs. Vick caught Orso’s eye, gave him a firmly committed nod\nwhich he rather appreciated, then followed His Eminence.\nA breeze came up, and took the Steadfast Standard, and made the white\nhorse against the gilded sun flap and ripple. The very flag under which\nCasamir had conquered Angland. Witness to so many military glories down\nthe centuries. Orso wondered if there was any chance of it presiding over\nanother.\n“You’ve seen a fair amount of action, Tunny.”\n“I’ve tended more towards inaction, Your Majesty. But yes.”\n“How bad is it? And bear in mind I’m a king. You should be honest.”\n“Begging your pardon, but I try never to be honest with a superior, and\nthe higher up the chain of command I go, the less honest I try to be. One\ncould hardly be higher up than a king. Unless you’ve got great Euz hiding\nsomewhere.”\n“If only,” said Orso. “An all-powerful demigod would be the very thing"

How bad is it?”\nTunny ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth, glanced about at\nthe hills, and the fields, and the men digging. “It’s bad.”\n“But we have a chance?”\n“If Rucksted arrives in time, and the enemy can’t stay together, and\nwe’re lucky with the weather…” Tunny broke out that radiant grin of his,\nthe deep lines crinkling around his eyes. “There’s always a chance. But any\ndelay works in our favour.”\n“Hmmm.” Orso narrowed his eyes towards that tower house on the hill,\nwondering if the Young Lion was at that very moment considering the\nposition through his eyeglass. “Colonel Gorst?”\n“Your Majesty?”\n“I would like you to conduct Corporal Tunny and his Steadfast Standard\nacross those fields. Seek out the intrepid Lord Governor of Angland! Seek\nhim out with the most pomp, ceremony and military bluster possible.\nTunny, I want your bloody salute to take an hour minimum.”\n“And once I’ve saluted?”\n“Then you invite the Young Lion to dinner. I may not be his equal with a\nsword, but I flatter myself to believe that I’m more than a match for him\nwith a fork. My father used to say a good king should attend always to the\nopinions of his subjects. My mother would add that he should then entirely\nignore ’em. Let’s hear the bastard out.” And Orso winked. “At great\nlength.”\nThe men kept digging. Out across the fields, the starlings swarmed back\nup into the afternoon sky.\nBad Ground\n“B\nad ground,” said Antaup, thumping a fist worriedly on the ancient\nparapet.\nFrom the roof of the tower-house, Leo could see the whole valley.\nStoffenbeck nestled between two hills—a rocky bluff overlooking the river\nto the west, a gentle ridge above ripe wheatfields to the east.\n“Ground we’ve got to cross to reach Adua,” said Jin.\nThat would’ve been easy in peacetime. Two paved roads converged on\nthe town from either side of the hill the tower-house stood on, met in\nStoffenbeck’s pretty market square and became one, then headed due south\ntowards the capital. Trouble was, the country between swarmed with King\nOrso’s forces. They’d fortified a wide crescent in the freshly reaped fields\nnorth of the town, bristling with stakes and gleaming spear points. There\nwas more metal, along with a few fluttering standards, spread out across the\nsummit of the grassy ridge. Squinting through his eyeglass, Leo could see\nsome men on top of the bluff as well. Wagons, too, maybe. He handed the\neyeglass to Antaup. “How many men, do you reckon?”\n“Hard to say. In the centre, they look well dug in, but the hills are\nweaker held. I see some King’s Own standards. Some others I don’t\nrecognise.”\n“More than we were expecting,” murmured Leo. Far more than they’d"

Looked like there might be a fight after all.\n“We’ve still got the numbers,” growled Jin, all Northern bravado. “Two\nto one, maybe.”\n“Maybe.” But a good chunk of them Leo didn’t trust. Isher’s men were\nwell drilled, but most of the Open Council’s forces had lovely uniforms but\nno discipline at all. Barezin had put together what he proudly called a\nGurkish Legion, but he’d taken anyone with an exotic look regardless of\nwhether they could even speak to each other, let alone had worn armour\nbefore. A good portion of Lady Wetterlant’s beggarly troops had most likely\njoined for a set of clothes then stolen away during the storm, taking their\nsupplies with them. Then there was the Great Wolf, who every day seemed\nmore likely to fight against Leo than for him.\n“Might be we should attack now,” said Jin, squinting up at the sun.\n“There’s still a few hours o’ daylight.”\nAntaup handed Leo the eyeglass. “Our men are nearly ready to go.”\n“Good old Anglanders,” said Leo, watching their orderly columns tramp\nfrom the road and form neat battle lines at the base of the hill, the flags\nthey’d fought under across the North and back flying overhead. Made him\nproud to see them. Made him proud to lead them. He scanned the fields they\nmight soon be advancing across and caught sight of another flag, coming\nfast towards them. A white horse on a golden sun, flashing and twinkling at\nthe head of two dozen armoured men.\n“The Steadfast Standard,” murmured Leo.\nAntaup raised his brows. “Looks like His Majesty wants to talk.”\nLeo couldn’t have asked for a more splendid group around him: Lords Isher\nand Barezin and a good twenty other members of the Open Council, Lord\nMustred and a dozen other noblemen of Angland, as well as Stour’s man\nGreenway and Rikke’s man Hardbread. And yet he felt very much alone as\nthe king’s standard-bearer reined in his snorting mount on the hillside, the\nSteadfast Standard snapping majestically with the breeze and two dozen\nKnights of the Body in full battle armour clattering to a halt behind. He was\na grizzled old veteran with a glint in his eye and a relaxed style in the\nsaddle, but he produced the most impeccable salute Leo ever saw. Crisp,\nelegant, no self-regarding flourish. The lords of the Open Council,\nfestooned with enough braid between them to rig a fleet, could’ve learned a\nthing or two about what a real soldier looked like.\n“Your Grace! My lords of the Open Council! Representatives of the\nNorth! I’m Corporal Tunny, standard-bearer to the High King of the Union,\nHis August Majesty King Orso the First. Colonel Gorst, Commander of the\nKnights of the Body, I believe you all know.”\nBeing dragged from the Lords’ Round by his boyhood hero had taken\naway none of Leo’s admiration for the man. Had increased it, if anything.\nHe was slightly hurt that Gorst sat frowning into the distance without even"

        "text": "Being dragged from the Lords’ Round by his boyhood hero had taken\naway none of Leo’s admiration for the man. Had increased it, if anything.\nHe was slightly hurt that Gorst sat frowning into the distance without even\nglancing in his direction.\n“Corporal… Tunny?” Barezin’s jowls trembled as he scornfully raised\nhis chin. “They’re wasting our time!”\n“It’s his message that matters,” grumbled Mustred, “not his rank.” Leo\nwould happily have swapped a few armchair generals for corporals of long\nexperience.\n“I’ve dabbled with higher, my lords,” said Tunny, grinning, “but it never\nsuited me. Carrying His Majesty’s standard is as much honour as I can\nmanage.”\n“The Steadfast Standard,” Leo found he’d murmured, with not a little\nawe.\nTunny grinned up fondly at it. “The very one King Casamir rode under\nwhen he delivered Angland from the savages. Makes you think about the\nUnion’s proud history. All that the provinces owe to the Crown.”\nLeo frowned. “If men like Casamir still wore the crown, I daresay we’d\nhave no quarrel.”\n“Fancy that. No quarrel is exactly what His Majesty wants. In the hopes\nof getting there, he’s invited you to dinner.” Tunny gave Leo’s sprawling\ncollection of allies a faintly amused glance. “Just the two of you, though, he\nwouldn’t want the conversation to wander too far from the matter.”\n“Which would be?” asked Isher.\n“Your demands and his possible concessions to those demands. The king\nknows men of your quality wouldn’t lead soldiers against him without\nlegitimate grievances. His Majesty is fully prepared to fight, but he wishes\nat all costs to avoid shedding Union blood on Union soil.”\n“He’s playing for time,” burst out Barezin. “I’ve a mind to order my\nmen across those bloody fields and take my dinner in bloody Stoffenbeck\nwithout his bloody invitation!”\nSteebling, the old lord who owned the ruinous tower-house, sitting\nnearby with a gouty leg up on a stool, threw in an unhelpful snort of\ncontempt.\n“I’ll give the orders,” growled Leo, and Barezin sank grumpily into the\nroll of fat under his chin. “Please convey my thanks to His Majesty. He’ll\nhave my answer within the hour.”\nTunny drew himself up in the saddle to deliver that exhibition of a salute\nagain, then whisked his horse masterfully about and bore the king’s radiant\nstandard back towards Stoffenbeck. You couldn’t deny it was a hell of a\nflag. Perhaps when this was over it would have to go back to Angland,\nwhere it belonged.\n“We should attack at once,” growled Barezin, with a warlike flourish of\nhis fist. “Eh, Isher? We should attack!” Some of the more aggressive lords\nmanfully grumbled their agreement. Easy for them to say, they’d attacked\nnothing more dangerous than a pork chop in their lives.\nIsher fidgeted with his gloves but said nothing. He’d a lot less to say on\na battlefield than in a drawing room, on the whole.\n“Are Stour’s men ready?” asked Leo, in Northern."

He’d a lot less to say on\na battlefield than in a drawing room, on the whole.\n“Are Stour’s men ready?” asked Leo, in Northern.\nGreenway’s grin was almost a leer. “Oh, we’re always up for a fight.”\nJin frowned sideways at him. “He didn’t ask you to measure your cock.\nHe asked if Stour’s men are ready.”\n“They’re working through the woods. An hour and they’ll be at the\ntreeline. Maybe two.”\nLeo winced. Maybe two could easily mean three. It wouldn’t be enough\nto push Orso back, he had to crush him. Could they do it in the lag end of\nan afternoon? He shaded his eyes, trying to work through the distances, the\ntimes, but there was so much to consider, his sight danced and his head\nbuzzed with it all. He turned to ask Jurand’s opinion, then remembered, and\nfelt the sting of disappointment and betrayal all over again. He was the only\none of Leo’s friends who’d ever really had an opinion worth listening to.\nSuch a clear thinker. Such a cool head in a crisis. Why did the best man Leo\nknew have to be a bloody pervert? He clenched his fist.\n“Isher, Barezin, what about you?”\n“My men are up,” fretted Isher, sounding less than delighted about it.\n“Already deploying on the right.”\n“And mine are coming up!” boomed Barezin. He couldn’t say a word\nwithout trying to make a threat out of it. “My Gurkish Legion will be ready\nto advance within the hour!”\nSteebling gave another contemptuous cackle. Leo gritted his teeth and\ndid his best to ignore it.\n“What about the rest of the Open Council?”\nBarezin thumped his fat fist into his fat palm. “Mostly up!”\n“Partly up,” said Isher. “Some are still bogged down on the bad\nroads…”\nThe roads were dried out now. It was damp command and soggy\ndiscipline that were slowing them down. They’d need more time to deploy,\nespecially with those orchards and that river ahead. But then the bluff\nbeyond looked only lightly held. It might be better to try to grab it now than\nwait…\n“Damn it,” Leo muttered. As a captain, the right things to do were never\nin doubt. Follow orders. Care for your men. Lead by example. As a general,\nthe right things were shrouded in fog. Everything was a best guess, a fine\njudgement, an each-way bet with thousands of lives staked on the outcome.\nThe decisions he’d taken in the past had always been in the heat of the\nmoment. He’d never had time to weigh the consequences.\nHad his mother been right? Was he no general? He caught himself\nwishing she was with him and forced the thought away. By the dead, he was\nthe Young Lion! But courage and a loud roar wouldn’t be enough. Antaup\nwas right, it was bad ground. Men would die taking those positions. Good\nmen. Friends like Ritter and Barniva, killed by his recklessness.\n“We have the numbers,” he mused to himself, rubbing at his aching leg.\n“They have no help coming.”"

Friends like Ritter and Barniva, killed by his recklessness.\n“We have the numbers,” he mused to himself, rubbing at his aching leg.\n“They have no help coming.”\n“Bunch o’ bloody traitors,” said Steebling, more than loud enough to be\nheard, swigging from a bottle and giving them a scornful stare over it. Leo\nwould’ve liked to kick him off his chair and roll him down the hill, but they\nwere here to free the Union’s people from the tyranny of the Closed\nCouncil, not kick them off their chairs, however much they deserved it.\nMustred gave him a nod of encouragement. “The men of Angland are\nwith you, Your Grace, whatever you decide.”\nThat should’ve been a comfort. But it only brought home to Leo that the\ndecision was entirely his. He’d always prided himself on being the\ndefinition of a man of action. Now, in command, on a battlefield with the\nenemy before him, the very place he’d always dreamed of being, he felt\nparalysed.\nHe found himself wishing that Rikke was there. He loved Savine, but\nshe’d a habit of forcing her opinions on people. A subtle, velvety kind of\nforcing, but her opinions still. Rikke had a way of cutting through the tangle\nto the simple heart of things. She’d helped him see what he wanted.\nHe rounded angrily on Hardbread. “Where the bloody hell is Rikke?”\nThe old warrior swallowed and gave a helpless shrug.\nHigh Ground\nR\nikke squatted in the wet woods, fretting at the old dowel around her\nneck, going over and over her own tooth marks with her thumbtip.\nHer father had spent half his life squatting in wet woods, and it was nice\nto feel that she was following in his footsteps, but that was poor\ncompensation for the clingy cold spreading across her back as the pines\nsteadily drip, drip, dripped upon her.\n“There’s a lot to be said for roofs,” she murmured, under her breath.\nShe glanced to the right. Armed men knelt among the trees, keeping low.\nThe best men Uffrith had, scarred and war-wise, weapons ready and faces\ntense. Isern-i-Phail sat with her back to a tree and her spear across her\nknees, slowly chewing. She leaned to one side, spat and raised her brows at\nRikke as if to say, Well?\nShe glanced to the left. More men. The Nail and the rest of Gregun\nHollowhead’s considerable family to the fore, teeth bared like wolves seen\na sheep. Hundreds more in the woods behind them, she knew. All tensed\nlike clenched fists, waiting on her say-so. Shivers was on one knee, grey\nhair plastered about his face with the morning dew, twisting that ring with\nthe red stone around and around on his little finger. He raised the one brow\nhe had at her as if to say, Well?\nRikke narrowed her eyes. Not that narrowing the right one made any\ndifference.

But the gate was naught but a gloomy\nrumour.\nShe fiddled at her dowel, fiddled, fiddled. Truth was she hadn’t needed it\nfor months. Let alone a fit, she’d barely had a quiver since she came down\nfrom the forbidden lake with the runes on her face. She’d always hated\nhaving to wear the damn thing, but here she was hanging on to it. Some last\nshred of childhood. Some hint of a past where she didn’t have to make the\nhard choices.\nShe twitched at a clonking sound, craned up at a creaking over the\nchatter of the river and squinted towards the archway at a bobbing light. A\nbreeze stirred the branches, and the mist shifted, and she saw two men. One\nhad a fine crested helmet, mail gleaming under a long cloak. The other had\na bald head, lamp held high in one hand as he pushed the other door wide.\nAnd the gates of Carleon stood invitingly open.\nRikke snapped the thong with a jerk of her wrist and tossed the dowel\naway into the bushes.\n“Go,” she hissed, and Shivers sprang up, quick and quiet with the Nail\nright at his heels. With a metal whisper, the first dozen were up and after\nthem, then the next dozen, then the next.\n“Come on,” Rikke whispered, nails cutting at her palms she was\nclenching her fists so tight. “Come on…”\nShe winced at the clattering footfalls as Shivers and the rest ran out onto\nthe wooden bridge. A moment she’d seen before, she was almost sure. Seen\nwith the Long Eye. The cloaked man in the gateway fumbled for his sword.\nHis shout became a gurgle as the bald man stabbed him in the throat and\nshoved him back into the shadows of the tunnel. Proof once again that a\nlittle gold can succeed where a lot of steel might fail. He raised his lamp\nand stood politely out of the way as Shivers rushed past, leading a steady\nflood of armed men into Carleon.\nRikke slowly stood, wincing at the ache in her knees from all that\nsquatting, and let her held breath sigh away. “So that’s it, then?”\n“A good first step, anyway.” Isern planted one boot on a rock, grinning\nas a tide of warriors streamed through the misty woods around them and\ninto the city, quiet as ghosts.\n“Don’t kill anyone you don’t have to!” called Rikke as she set out\ntowards the gates. She was far from the only one in the North with a taste\nfor revenge, after all.\nThings were surprisingly quiet inside the walls, for a city that just got taken.\nKnots of Uffrith’s Carls stood on the corners, weapons drawn and\nshields in hand, one or two painted with the design of the Long Eye. Some\nprisoners sat about, weapons down and hands bound. A few townsfolk\npeered scared from windows and doors as Rikke walked past.\n“Don’t worry!” She gave what she hoped was a reassuring grin, though"

But at least she was trying. Trying a deal harder than when\nBlack Calder took Uffrith, she reckoned.\nThe Nail was leaning against a wall, using a dagger to carefully drill a\nhole in the pointy end of an egg. He’d a way of standing very still, nothing\nmoving until it had to.\n“Worked, then,” he said as she walked up.\n“Told you it would.”\n“Not sure we’ve lost one dead.”\n“Good news. On their side?”\n“A couple. Weren’t a tenth o’ the men guarding the place there’d usually\nbe.”\n“Aye,” said Rikke. “They’re all off in Midderland, fighting King Orso.”\n“Where you told ’em you’d be.”\n“That’s why I told ’em so. Reckoned we’d have a lot more fun here.”\nThe Nail shook his head, blade flashing as he worked that dagger back\nand forth. “I knew you were a bad enemy to have.” He looked up at her\nfrom under his pale brows, his pale lashes. A long, slow look, just taking it\nall in. “Now I’m wondering if you might be a bad friend to have and all.”\n“I’m a bad friend to betray, I can tell you that. Savine dan Brock\nwould’ve sold me out soon enough.” Rikke realised she’d put her hand to\nthe chain of emeralds she wore and took it away again. “She’s a woman\nwho sells everything.” The two of them smiling together, on the bench in\nher father’s garden. Her hand on Savine’s belly. The baby shifting under her\nfingers. “As for her husband…” She thought of Leo’s boyish grin, all\ntrusting, all heart, thought of him laughing with her father, thought of the\nboy he’d been, playing in the barn. She wondered what’d become of him\nnow, in Midderland, without the help she’d promised. She felt a twinge of\nguilt, then was annoyed with herself for feeling it. You have to make of\nyour heart a stone.\n“Have I done what I said I’d do?” she asked.\n“You have,” said the Nail.\n“Has it worked out the way I said it would?”\n“Thus far.”\n“So what’s your complaint?”\n“I’m not saying I’ve got one.”\n“What are you saying?”\nHe blew a little dust from the top of his egg and his pale eyes rolled up\nto hers. “I’m saying don’t give me one.”\n“I’ll bear that in mind.” She nodded towards the big wall up ahead.

Some men were easing towards the gate\nwith their shields up, and a couple of arrows looped down and skittered\nfrom the cobbles, made them shuffle back. “In the meantime, we’ve still got\nwork.”\n“There’s always work.” The Nail kept on drilling at that egg with his\ndagger, patient as tree-roots. “The gates were shut when we got here.\nWhoever’s inside don’t feel like opening ’em. Keeps shooting arrows at\nus.”\n“Not very neighbourly.”\n“No. Come night-time, I was thinking I might climb over there and\nteach ’em better manners.”\nRikke considered the walls. Damned high, they were, and stark, and\ngrey. “Let’s give ’em a while to consider their predicament. Meantime keep\nthe peace, eh? Make sure no more blood gets spilled in town.”\n“You’re forgiving.”\n“A minute ago, I was too ruthless for you. Now forgiving’s a bad thing?”\n“Depends who you forgive.” He squinted up towards the walls. “In war,\nyou seize all the high ground you can.” He lifted the egg to his lips, looking\nsmall between his big finger and thumb. “Except the moral kind.” And he\nsucked the insides out through the hole. “That ain’t worth shit.”\nIsern-i-Phail was in a square not far away, a row of disarmed warriors on\ntheir knees in front of her. Corleth stood nearby, proudly holding the\nstandard of the Long Eye. Rikke walked over and planted her hands on her\nhips.\n“I expect kneeling in the street wasn’t what you were hoping for when\nyou got out of bed this morning,” she said. “I can only say I’m sorry for\nthat.”\n“Are you, though?” asked Isern. “Really?”\nRikke grinned all across her face. “Not one bit. The thought of Stour\nNightfall’s face when he finds we stole his city is what’s been keeping me\ncheery these last few weeks.”\n“Reckon he’ll shit his britches and cry for his mummy.”\n“Wouldn’t be surprised,” said Rikke.\n“But his mummy won’t come,” said Isern, cackling away to herself, “on\naccount of being long years dead, d’you see, and he’ll be gnashing his teeth\nand kicking himself, and his mouth’ll pucker up like a little arsehole, and\n—”\n“You are straying from the point, Isern.”\nIsern cleared her throat. “’Tis a failing common in my family. Return us\nto the matter.”\n“It’s not Stour’s mother I’m after, but his father.” Rikke turned back to\nthe kneeling men. “You fellows help me out, you’ll find me reasonable.\nMore reasonable than Stour fucking Shitefall, leastways.”\n“Shitefall,” chuckled Isern, shaking her head.\n“Now, where’s Black Calder?”\nThe one on the left, a sour-looking old bastard with a scar through his\nshort grey hair, lifted his head to sneer up at her. “Fuck yourselves, you mad\nbitches.”"

But right now, I’m a little busy stealing your\ncity. Where’s Black Calder?”\n“Didn’t you fucking hear me?” He bared his teeth. “I said—” Isern\ngrabbed him by the hair and stabbed him in the side of the neck, chopped\nhis throat out with an easy flick of the wrist and sent black blood squirting,\nshoved him down into the gutter with her boot on his back.\nIt was good to be forgiving, but this was the North still. Rikke’s father\nnever liked killing. Hadn’t stopped him doing it when he had to. It wouldn’t\nstop her, either.\n“Might be there was a lot to like about him, once you broke through the\ngritty crust.” Rikke gave a sigh as she watched him squirm under Isern’s\nboot. “Might be he had a collection of interesting bird skulls, or an excellent\nsinging voice, or a lot of love for his sadly passed sister that caused him to\nweep at the quiet times.” Rikke looked at the rest of the men, all of them\nstaring over with wide eyes. “But there’s so much to feel sorry for in the\nworld. Can’t waste too much on folk who act like pricks.”\nThe sour-looking bastard had stopped moving and Isern reached down,\nwiped her dagger on the arse of his trousers, got distracted by her reflection\nin the bright blade, frowned as she rubbed at a smudge of something on her\ncheek.\nRikke stepped sideways, before the spreading pool of blood reached her\nfeet, to stand in front of the next man. She’d always thought of herself as a\nfigure of fun. Giggling Rikke, fountain o’ laughs. Still seemed strange\npeople might be scared of her. But she had to admit there was something\nsatisfying about the fear in his eyes. Beat contempt, anyway.\n“I like your look better,” she said, wagging her finger at him.\n“Pleasant-seeming personage, this one,” said Isern, tapping him on the\nshoulder with her dagger. “Family man, if I might take a guess?”\n“Two daughters,” he croaked out.\n“Aw,” said Rikke. “How old?”\n“Six and two.”\n“Aw,” said Corleth.\n“Those girls need their daddy,” said Rikke. “I’m hopeful you’ll be\nhelpful.”\n“Hopeful you’ll be helpful.” Isern gave a little chuckle. “That’s got a\nnice balance.”\n“Always had a feel for the poetry of language,” said Rikke. “Now,\nwhere’s Black Calder?”\nThe eyes of the father of two daughters flickered sideways, straining\ntowards Isern’s dagger, just out of sight. “Not here,” he croaked.\n“Well, don’t worry, we’re making progress.

He sets new standards.”\nRikke nodded towards the gates of the inner wall. The gates with\nSkarling’s Hall beyond, still tight shut. “So who’s in charge in there?”\n“Brodd Silent.”\nName meant nothing to Rikke. She shrugged at Isern, and the hillwoman\nshrugged back.\n“My guess would be he don’t say much,” said Corleth, which seemed a\nreasonable assumption.\n“He ain’t got many men, though,” said the father of two. “No more’n a\ncouple of dozen.”\n“Maybe three dozen,” offered one of the others, shuffling forward on his\nknees. Here was a sad lesson. You can talk fine words till your tongue\nbleeds and never get a favour. Cut one throat and everyone’s falling over\nthemselves to be helpful.\n“Three dozen’s not many,” said Isern.\n“No.” Rikke scratched her head as she frowned up at the black\nbattlements against the white sky. “But he don’t need many to hold that.”\nCommon Ground\n“S\no sorry I’m late,” said Orso, striding into the room. The table was set\nfor a royal dinner, silverwear gleaming. “So much to do, you understand.\nWell, of course you understand, you’ve an army of your own to manage.\nAnd bigger even than mine! Don’t get up!” Hildi struck a match and began\nto light the tall candles as Orso trotted over to offer his hand, smiling\nhugely. His mother had always told him it was important to smile.\nEspecially at your enemies.\nBrock was not much changed. Every bit the chunkily handsome\nstorybook hero that Orso remembered. He had grown something of a beard,\nbut then he probably grew a beard between breakfast and lunch, even those\nbits at the corners of the mouth that Orso could never quite get to come\nthrough. Frozen uncomfortably between rising and staying seated, Brock\nlooked at the proffered hand with an air of puzzled disgust. Like a man who\nhad rolled over to find a turd in his bed. Then he reluctantly reached for it.\n“Not too firmly!” said Orso. “Remember I’m no warrior!” When\nBrock’s hand gingerly gripped his, he gave it as bone-crushing a squeeze as\nhe could manage and was mildly gratified to see him wince. Small victories,\nperhaps, but Orso’s father had always said one must take all the victories\none can get.\nBrock gestured to the two men he had brought with him, standing grimly\nagainst the wall. “These are my aides—Antaup…” Lean and handsome,\nwith that slicked-back black hair which somehow always let a rakish lock\nor two drop over the forehead. “And Whitewater Jin.” A rugged, red-\nbearded Northman who looked to have been opening doors with his face"

Couldn’t you have\nsimply… stayed loyal?” And Orso took a noisy slurp from his glass,\nregarding the Lord Governor of Angland over the rim.\n“Loyal?” Brock stared back at him, ever so slightly pale. “No man was\nmore loyal than me when Scale Ironhand attacked the Protectorate. We\nleaped to the Dogman’s defence. Never considered anything else. We were\noutnumbered but we fought even so. We knew we had the Union behind us.\nWe knew help would come.

This story was making his wine taste\nsomewhat sour.\n“But all we got from Midderland was well-wishes,” said Brock, nobly\ndisappointed, “and empty promises, and endless demands for taxes. Do you\nwonder why there wasn’t a man in Angland who wouldn’t follow me here?”\nHis voice was growing louder and louder. Self-righteousness suited him.\n“We fought your war. Men died.

It was a shame it had come to this.\n“You make a very good point,” said Orso. “No doubt it will mean\nnothing to you now, but I find it hard to describe my utter shame and\ndisgust that you were sent no help. I did try, in my own rather useless\nway… something of an irony that most of the men I field against you now\nare the ones I raised to help you then. But the Breakers rose up in Valbeck,\nand I had to fight that fire first. And then… well. You know what happened\nat Red Hill and afterwards better than anyone. Suffice to say you managed\nwithout us. The Closed Council let you down. My father let you down.” He\ntook a hard breath. “I let you down. But… is this really the remedy?\nInsurrection? Treason? Civil war?”\nBrock glared across the table. “You left us no choice.”\n“Really? Because I don’t remember anyone trying to talk to me about it.\nI know we have our differences, but we both, I think, believe in the Union?\nWhile there is still time—can we not find a way to satisfaction without the\ndeaths of so many of our countrymen? Can we not find some common\nground?”\n“Perhaps,” said Brock coldly, “if you were to dismiss your entire Closed\nCouncil and replace them with men of our choosing.”\n“And taking a wild guess… you would choose yourselves?”\n“We’d choose patriots!” shouted Brock, thumping the table again but\nwith less conviction. “Men of quality.” Moving away from the sun-\ndrenched uplands of anger and into the shadowy thickets of politics, he was\nrather less impressive. “Men who can… well… take the Union back to its\nfounding principles.”\n“But whether a man is a patriot, or for that matter of quality, all depends\non who you ask, doesn’t it? Our current predicament makes that abundantly\nclear, if nothing else. As for principles, it was Bayaz who founded the"

As for principles, it was Bayaz who founded the\nUnion, and he’s still on the Closed Council when it pleases him, in spite of\nmy best efforts. You should spend some time in there. You’ll find your most\nproudly rigid principles turn shockingly flaccid. The First of the Magi can\nstretch them until they fit around any outrage, believe me.”\nLeo dan Brock’s impressive jaw muscles worked, but to little result. He\nreally was no philosopher. “We have the numbers,” he grumbled. “You have\nto surrender.”\n“Well, I’m no general, but I believe… technically speaking… I could\nfight and lose? Put yourself in my place. Would you surrender?”\nOrso could almost see the wheels turning behind Brock’s eyes. Plainly,\nputting himself in someone else’s place was not something he did often.\nWas not something he had the equipment for. Perhaps it was fortunate that\nHildi barged in at that moment with a gilded tray in her hands, two bowls of\nSuljuk porcelain steaming on top.\n“Aha!” Orso whisked up his spoon. “My cook is called Bernille, and I\nknow they say nothing good ever comes from Talins, but I swear her soup\nwill change your mind.”\nBrock frowned down at his bowl, then over at his friend Antaup.\n“Oh, come on, I’m not going to poison you.” Orso leaned across, dipped\nhis spoon in Brock’s soup and sucked it dry. “Now eat up, there’s a good\nfellow. There are excuses for High Treason but letting Bernille’s soup go\ncold is bloody unforgivable.”\nProbably it was great soup. If kings don’t have great soup, who does, after\nall? But Leo was in no mood to enjoy it. He felt angry, and worried, and\nwith the sky almost dark outside the narrow windows, like he’d missed his\nchance. He’d been sure Orso would be out of his depth with soldiers in the\nfield. That he’d be weak, and cowardly, and desperate to concede to\nanything. But the man couldn’t have looked more relaxed. You had to\nadmire his nerve. Anyone would’ve thought he was the one with the\nnumbers.\n“So…” and Orso tossed his spoon into his empty bowl. “If I replace my\nClosed Council with your chosen men, I get to stay king? I honestly don’t\nenjoy it, but all my crockery has little crowns on, and so forth. Changing\neverything would be…” He glanced at his strange little waiter.\nShe puffed out her cheeks as she filled his glass again. “Bloody\nnightmare.”\n“We’re not usurpers,” grumbled Leo, “we’re—”\n“Patriots, yes, of course,” said Orso, “but I’m not sure you’ve thought\nthis all the way through. Once the troops go home… what’s to stop me\nchanging my mind?”\nLeo had tended to leave the thinking through to Jurand, and Savine, and\nhis mother, and none of them was there. He frowned and said nothing.\n“I am sure your friend Lord Isher has thought it through. He’s not a man\nto under-plan, eh? We both know all that nonsense with Wetterlant was"

We both know all that nonsense with Wetterlant was\nentirely his design.”\n“How d’you mean?” muttered Leo, feeling as if he was blundering into a\ntrap but unable to stop himself.\n“He came to me. Isher. Offering to heal the wounds between the Closed\nand Open Councils. To orchestrate a deal that would see Wetterlant\nimprisoned, the commoners satisfied, the noblemen mollified and me\nlooking like a masterful statesman.” Orso snorted. “I should have known.\nAny plan intended to make me look good has to be doomed. Ah! Fish!”\nOrso’s blonde-haired girl came out of nowhere and whisked a steaming\nplate in front of Leo. “Bernille really does work magic with seafood.” Orso\ntwirled a fork around between his fingers. “She’s more sorceress than cook,\neven in a farmhouse kitchen. No, no, it’s the small cutlery, Leo. What was I\nsaying?”\n“Wetterlant and Isher,” said Corporal Tunny.\n“Ah, yes. I went into the Lords’ Round that day expecting to emerge just\nyet merciful. Imagine my dismay when I ended up the epitome of an idiotic\ntyrant. But then, spare a thought for Wetterlant.” He forked up a chunk of\nfish and chewed with great relish. “He was left dangling. Literally. I\ncouldn’t even make a clean job of that. Quite the ugly scene. I bloody hate\nhangings. Still, I’ll confess I don’t miss the man. An utterly loathsome\nspecimen and guilty as the plague. So much for the good graces of Lord\nIsher, eh? He loves to play the peacemaker, but he’s been sowing discord\nthis whole time. I daresay he’s the one who sold this little package to you\nfirst? Told you Wetterlant was wronged and I was a monster? Men of\nquality.” And he shook his head and chuckled.\nLeo frowned, fork frozen halfway to his mouth. He’d been rather\npleased with how he’d done the righteous anger, but now he wasn’t\nenjoying himself at all. Talking to Orso was like talking to Jappo Murcatto,\nbut with higher stakes and lower hopes of success. All his firm reasons, his\nnoble certainties, his staunch alliances, seemed to be crumbling like castles\nmade of sand.\n“I don’t know what story you’ve been told about reform, and freeing me\nfrom my chains and blah, blah, blah, but I’m quite certain Isher means to\nreplace me entirely. Probably with you. Not sufficiently glorious to make a\ngood puppet, is he? But I daresay he imagines he could pull the strings\nskilfully enough. And then, of course… there is your wife.”\nLeo forced the words through gritted teeth. “Leave her out of this.”\n“Please, no one has a higher opinion of Savine than I do.” Orso gave a\nsad little sigh, staring off into the middle distance. “I’ve been in love with\nthe woman for years, in spite of my best efforts.

But I don’t think it’s unfair\nto say she’s just…” And he held up finger and thumb with a hair’s breadth\nbetween them. “A teensy bit ambitious. I wouldn’t put money on great\nJuvens if he came between her and what she wanted. I never imagined she\nwould be able to resist being queen. That’s why I was so surprised that she\nturned me down.”\n“That she what?”\n“When I proposed to her.”\nLeo just managed to stop himself giving a strangled squawk. If he’d\nbeen floundering in the conversation before, he was drowning in it now.\nClearly his wife hadn’t shared the whole truth when it came to her\nrelationship with the king. What else might she have kept from him?\n“A bolt of lightning could have struck me no more forcefully than when\nshe said no,” mused Orso, chopping at his fish with the side of his fork.\n“But… perhaps she found another way to make herself queen? I hear she is\nwith you on campaign. She always did like to keep a close eye on her\ninvestments.”\n“You’ve got it all wrong!” growled Leo, wondering if he actually had it\nall right. His chair shrieked on the stone-flagged floor as he stood, and he\nhad to smother a gasp at the stab of pain in his leg. “We’ve nothing more to\ndiscuss!”\n“But we’ve still got the main course!”\n“It’s liver,” said Hildi.\n“Ah! Bernille does it so it just…” and Orso closed his eyes, touched his\nlips and let his fingers flutter gently off, “melts away to nothing. You\nknow.” He opened his eyes and smiled. “Like excuses for rebellion.”\n“You mind if I…?” Hildi was already poised over Leo’s half-eaten fish\nwith a fork in her hand.\n“Have at it,” he snarled as he turned for the door. “I’ll see you on the\nbattlefield.”\nOrso almost choked on his wine. “Bloody hell, I hope not.”\nDoubts and Desires\n“A\nre you awake?” whispered Leo.\nOf course she was. How could she sleep with the endless kicking of her\nbaby, the endless noise of soldiers on the move outside the window, the\nendless doubts, fears, hopes chasing each other around her mind like stray\ndogs after the butcher’s cart?\nSavine had to slide her arm under her belly and half-lift it so she could\nwriggle over to face him. The first light was touching the sky outside, a\nfaint gleam in the corners of his eyes, a glow on his cheek, shifting as his\njaw nervously worked.\n“You should go back to Ostenhorm,” he said. “It’s not safe here—”\n“We’re together in this, Leo.” She tried to make her voice the essence of\ncalm. Like a mother soothing her child. Like a lion tamer trying to keep his\nbeast on the stool. “We have to be together in this.” She took his hand and\nslid it onto her belly. She wasn’t sure which of them the trembling came\nfrom. “All our futures are at stake.”"

She wasn’t sure which of them the trembling came\nfrom. “All our futures are at stake.”\n“By the dead, Savine…” His voice was the essence of panic. “Have I\nmade a terrible mistake?”\nShe felt a stab of anger, then. Everyone has doubts. The Fates knew she\ndid. But leaders have to crush their doubts down deep inside where they\ncannot leak out and stain the entire enterprise. It was far too late for second\nthoughts. The dice were out of their hands and already rolling.\nShe felt a stab of anger, but losing her temper was a luxury she could not\nafford. “You’ve done the right thing.” She made herself meet his eye, made\nherself sound sure. “You’ve done what you had to.”\n“Can I trust Isher?”\nSavine would not have trusted him to carry her night-pot. “Of course\nyou can, he’s bound to us, Leo, he has no—”\n“Can I trust Stour?”\nTo call Stour a wild dog was unfair. Wild dogs were at least capable of\nloyalty. “He respects you. And it’s a little late to be—”\n“Can I trust you?”\nSilence. Faint cries and clatters outside as they moved up supplies by\ntorchlight. “How can you ask me that?” she snarled. She wanted to slap\nhim. “You’re the one who chose this! All I’ve done is everything I can to\nmake sure it succeeds!” And promised Uffrith to Stour, and promised the\nClosed Council to Isher, and promised the throne to herself. “Orso stuffed\nyour head with doubts, didn’t he? Damn it, I told you not to underestimate\nhim!”\nAnother silence. She could hear his quick breathing. She could hear her\nown. “You’re right,” he said grudgingly. “You’re always bloody right.” He\neven managed to make that sound like an accusation. “I just don’t even\nknow where half my friends are, let alone my enemies. Rikke, and Jurand\n—”\n“Leo—”\n“What if my mother was right? What if I’m a warrior but no general?\nWhat if—”\nShe wished she did not always have to be the strong one. The Fates\nknew, she could have used some comfort. But some people need to be held\nup. Which means some people need to do the holding.\nShe clapped a hand to his head, twisted her fingers in his hair and\ndragged his face towards her. “Stop. You’re not just a warrior, or a leader, or\na general, you’re a hero.” Heroes are defined not by what they do, after all,\nor why, but by what people think they have done. “The cause is just.” She\nwould be a wonderful queen. “We have strong allies beside us.” A circle of\nself-serving snakes. “We are going to win.” They had fucking better. “And\nthe people of the Union will win with us. They need us. They need you.” It\ndid not matter whether she believed it, only that she made him believe. She\nhad to blow him up with hot air until he towered over the battlefield. “I"

She\nhad to blow him up with hot air until he towered over the battlefield. “I\nneed you,” and she pulled him close, and gave him the softest kiss.\nIt had been meant just to shut him up, but it lasted longer than she had\nexpected. When she broke away, they stared at each other in the darkness,\nquick breath hissing between them.\nShe licked her lips and went back for another. Hungrier now, and deeper,\nwriggling half on top of him. The constant ache between her legs had\nalready sharpened to a pleasurable throbbing. It wasn’t just her hands that\nwere endlessly swollen. She slipped one leg over his and started to rub\nherself against it. Subtly at first. Then not subtly at all. Humping him like an\novereager puppy.\n“Are you sure?” he whispered.\n“We’re all awake now.” And she caught his head and pushed her tongue\ninto his mouth.\nThis was one thing she had not expected about carrying a child. She had\nnever felt less capable of coupling. Never wanted to more. Even now, with\neverything she had at stake. Especially now, maybe.\nHe was half-hard by the time she got his nightshirt up. She kept kissing\nhim, one hand between her legs, one hand between his. Someone has to do\nthe work, after all.\nWhen she gave birth to this bloody thing it would be heir to the throne\nof the Union. That decision was made already. She would never be caught\ndefenceless again, as she had been in Valbeck. Never be scared, never be\nvulnerable. If Orso had to lose, and her father, and Rikke, so be it. She\nwould be safe. She would be powerful. If the world had to lose so she could\nwin, so be it. The dice were already rolling.\nShe grunted as she heaved herself over onto her hands and knees,\nsquirmed as she dragged her nightdress clumsily up over her hips. He knelt\nthere, staring at her bare arse, nightshirt draped over his cock like a theatre\ncurtain caught on a rogue piece of the set.\nRidiculous. But there it was.\nShe slid her elbows forward so the mattress could give some support to\nher over-heavy chest and pushed the side of her face into the pillow.\n“Get it done, then,” she hissed.\nTallow stood with his hands wedged in his armpits as the wind bent the tall\ngrass, shivering. He never seemed to have the right clothes for the weather.\nExactly like her brother in that regard. The thought made Vick feel\ndecidedly uncomfortable, and she drew her coat tight about her. A black\nInquisitor’s coat. Not something she wore often. She spent most of her time\ntrying to look as little like a member of the Inquisition as possible. But if\nyou didn’t wear your uniform to a battle, when would you?\nFrom up here on the bluff, the dark valley was dusted with thousands of\npinprick lights. Campfires, wagon lamps, sentries’ torches. You could pick\nout the roads, the cluster of Stoffenbeck’s windows, the long battle lines\ncutting crooked across the hills and fields in dots of fire, a gulf of darkness\nlying between the two sides."

Spend it wisely, you might avoid the fight in the first place.”\n“There’s something wrong with the world all right,” said Vick, watching\nArch Lector Pike step over to the closest cannon and sight down its barrel\ninto the darkened valley.\nHe’d positioned them with the care of an emperor’s butler setting table\nfor a state dinner. Eighteen darkly gleaming, tapering tubes, set on heavy\nwooden trestles in a long row just below the brow of the hill. Leather-\naproned engineers from the Siege School followed His Eminence down the\nline, cranking, adjusting, checking instruments, pointing excitedly towards\nthe river where water glimmered faintly in the darkness.\n“This one a little to the left, I think,” said Pike, then walked up to the\nsummit of the hill to stand beside Vick, staring out at the valley. “We have\nbeen experimenting in the Far Country for several years now.” He watched\nthe crews drag brush around the maws of the great iron tubes to hide them\nfrom sight. “And have found that cannons are like birthday presents. Best\nkept as a surprise.”\n“I’ve never liked surprises,” said Vick.\n“I suspect the enemy will feel the same.”\n“Your Eminence!”\nTwo dark figures came across the hillside. One had a torch and a mask.\nThe other was a boy, stumbling along with hands tied behind him. A\nPractical and a prisoner.\n“Caught him trying to run.” The Practical shoved the lad down on his\nknees in front of Pike, the wind ruffling his curly hair. Couldn’t have been\nmore than fourteen. Looked younger. Tallow swallowed and slowly shrank\nback into the darkness.\n“Dear, dear.” Pike took a long breath and squatted beside the boy,\ntorchlight glistening on the shiny burned skin on the side of his face. “Do\nyou know who I am?”\nThe lad nodded, mouth hanging dumbly open. He looked up at Vick, and\ntook a long sniff, then looked down at the ground between his knees. He\nmust’ve known what was coming. And yet he just sat there.\n“Which unit are you with?”\n“Lord Crant’s regiment,” he croaked out. “I’m a loader. I load flatbows.\nWell, I just crank ’em.” Once he’d started talking he couldn’t seem to stop.\n“My friend Gert puts the bolts in, then hands ’em back to—”\n“Shush,” said Pike, softly. There was silence then, and the wind stirred\nthe grass, and Vick found she was wincing. The boy would make a good\nexample, to keep the others at their posts. There was a tree near the summit\nwith a low bough that would be just right. If they’ll hang a boy for running,\nwho won’t they hang?"

If they’ll hang a boy for running,\nwho won’t they hang?\n“Gert stayed,” whispered the boy, “but I… I don’t want to die.”\nPike turned towards those thousands of pinprick lights, twinkling in the\nvalley. “Faced with something on this scale, there could be no more rational\nresponse than to run away. But sometimes… we must do things that are not\nrational. Sometimes we must act on faith.” Pike stared at the lad and the lad\nstared back, the Practical looming dark over both. “Sometimes… even as\nthe world goes mad… we must crouch next to Gert and load flatbows.”\nAnother silence. Then the lad’s knobbly throat shifted as he swallowed.\n“I’d like to do that.”\n“Good.” Pike set his hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Go back to Lord\nCrant’s regiment, then.” He nodded to the Practical, and the Practical cut\nthe ropes on the boy’s wrists.\n“What do I tell them?”\n“That you got lost, but I guided you back to the right path. Isn’t that the\ntruth?”\nThe boy wiped tears on his sleeve. “That’s the truth.”\n“This time, for both our sakes, you should stay at your post.”\nThe boy jumped up like an eager puppy. “I’ll stay there if hell comes up\nthe hill in the morning!”\n“I suppose it very well might,” murmured Pike as he watched him scurry\naway. “You look surprised, Inquisitor.”\n“I was expecting something… harsher,” said Vick. “From your\nreputation.”\n“I find reputations rarely fit people all that well. What are they, after all,\nbut costumes we put on to disguise ourselves?” The mottled skin above his\nhairless brows twitched as he gave her uniform a glance. “Costumes we are\nforced to put on. If men are to be productive, they must have something to\nfear. That is why we have an Inquisition. I like to tell myself that every life I\nhave taken has saved five more. Fifty more, perhaps. Not everyone has the\nstomach for that kind of arithmetic.” His eyes gleamed with the Practical’s\ntorch. “It is one thing I admire about you, Inquisitor Teufel. One cannot\ncome through the camps without developing a very strong stomach.”\nVick said nothing as the boy vanished over the crest of the hill, a black\nfigure against the dark sky.\n“I understand cowards,” said Pike softly. “I used to be one. Who among\nus never had a weak moment, after all? It cannot all be darkness. We must\nhave a little mercy.” He leaned sideways to whisper it. “As long as no one\nsees.”\nBroad sat and polished his armour. Didn’t need polishing. Brand new from\nthe armoury at Ostenhorm. But it helps to have a routine. He used to do it\nout in Styria, the long nights before the long dawns. Kept him calm. That\nand the drink, anyway. And who was going to sleep now?\nScattered in every direction were other fires, other little knots of\nsleepless men, scraping the time away as the light leaked into the sky."

And who was going to sleep now?\nScattered in every direction were other fires, other little knots of\nsleepless men, scraping the time away as the light leaked into the sky.\nTalking solemnly about the ground, or brashly about deeds they’d do\ntomorrow, or mournfully about families waiting back at home.\nMaybe Broad should’ve been thinking of his family. Of May’s quick\nlook sideways when she spoke. The lines around Liddy’s eyes when she\nsmiled. But he knew what was coming with the dawn, and he didn’t want it\nto touch them. Not even in his memory.\n“That all the armour you’ll wear?” asked Bannerman, firelight shifting\nacross that little smile he liked to wear.\n“Aye,” said Broad. Breastplate and steel cap. Nothing clever.\n“Laddermen prefer to go light.” Halder rubbed at the tattoo on the back\nof his hand. Same as Broad’s, but with just the one star. Some would say\nthat was one too many. “Quicker you get to the top, the better your\nchances.”\n“The best armour’s quick feet and high hopes,” Broad murmured. That\nwas what they used to say to each other, while they waited for an assault.\nUsually while getting good and drunk.\n“Defence won’t save you in the press at the top o’ those walls,” said\nHalder. “Only attack. Only fury.” Broad kept his eyes on the steel, but his\nheart was thudding. “No room to think.” He remembered what happened\nwhen you got to the top of the ladder. “No room to breathe.” The cauldron\nof violence. Men made animals. Men made meat. “Pressed in so close\nyou’ll never reach a weapon at your hip, let alone swing it.” Halder was\nwhispering it, now. “You need something you can use to kill a man who’s\nclose enough to kiss.”\nThat’s why Broad wore a stabbing dagger across his chest. More a long\nspike than a knife, its three edges barely even sharpened. It was the point\ndid the work, overhand, up under a helmet or into the joints in armour, or\nthe pommel, or the heavy knuckleguard in a pinch. He remembered the feel\nof a cheekbone crunching, the sticky trickle of blood down the grip. Broad\nwinced as he made his aching fist unclench. He wondered if Judge had been\nright. Only happy when he was bloody.\n“Well, we’ve got no walls to climb,” said Bannerman, “so I’ll take a\nsword, thanks all the same.” And he drew a few inches of his own blade,\nthen slapped it back into its sheath.\n“Sword’s a fine thing for riding down archers. Fighting armoured men\nface-to-face you can do better.” Halder nodded at Broad’s warhammer, laid\nout on an oilcloth, waiting for its own turn to be polished. “Hit a helmet\nhard with that, you can crack the skull inside without breaking the steel.”\nTrue enough. But Broad had got more use from the bladed pick on the\nback. Fine thing for hooking a man who was leaning over a parapet and\ndragging him off.

No doubt an observer would have thought him immensely vain, but\nthe truth was Orso saw no fine features in a mirror, only faults and failures.\n“More reinforcements.” Hildi stood at one of the windows of the grand\nroom the mayor had insisted Orso slept in, watching soldiers tramp past\nStoffenbeck’s town hall towards the front. Where they would soon be\nfighting. Where they would soon be dying. That was the theme of Orso’s\nreign. The conversion of brave men into corpses.\n“Three regiments came in last night,” he said, “as well as a hugely\nenthusiastic group of farmers from the next valley, demanding to fight for\ntheir king.”\n“Inspiring.”\n“If you find stupidity inspiring.” Orso did, in fact. But he had ordered\nthem back home regardless.\n“Position’s stronger, though?” asked Hildi, hopefully.\n“Stronger than it was. Lord Marshal Forest still considers us well\noutnumbered.”\n“Battles aren’t always won by the biggest numbers.”\n“No,” said Orso. “Just usually.”\nHe placed an unhappy hand on his belly and tried his best to suck it in.\nOne cannot suck in one’s hips, though. It was reaching the point where he\nwas considering some form of corset. Savine always looked spectacular in\nthem, after all, and exercise was out of the bloody question. He let it all sag\nagain with horrifying results.\n“I daresay Leo dan Brock never has to hold in his belly,” he murmured.\n“Wouldn’t have thought so. All hard and grooved like a cobbled street, I\nreckon.” Hildi was gazing into the corner of the room with a dreamy\nexpression. “Combining the best of dancer and docker.”\n“While I combine the worst of idler and innkeeper?” Orso pulled his\nshirt on with bad grace. “Maybe you can get a job oiling the Young Lion’s\nstomach once he’s replaced me.”\n“A girl can dream.”\n“There’s more to a man than his gut.”\n“No doubt. You’ve put some weight on under the chin as well.”\nOrso sighed. “Thank you very much for that, Hildi, I’m never at risk of\ngetting too self-satisfied with you around.”\nHe twitched a curtain back to watch those men marching past. Probably\nhe should have been moved by their loyalty. His father would have flapped\na half-clenched fist around and trotted out some patriotic platitude. But\nOrso found himself wondering what strange combination of doubts and\ndesires compelled each individual to subsume themselves into this metal\nmass, plodding towards their own destruction rather than making the\neminently sensible choice to run like hell the other way."

Such petty concerns are for the little people, my dear.” From the\nwindow he could see the low ridge to the east of town, the spindly trees on\ntop, a faint hint of dawn showing in the clouds behind. “I don’t think I can\nput it off any longer. When the sun comes up… I’m going to have to bloody\nfight.”\n“Shall I get your armour?”\n“I think you’d better. And tell Bernille I’m ready for breakfast.”\n“Diet tomorrow, eh?”\nOrso patted at his stomach. “If I’m still alive.”\nStour Nightfall was having quite the sulk.\nFlick had built a good fire for breakfast, near to the treeline where they\ncould get news if aught happened on the hills ahead. Flick wasn’t bad at\nbuilding fires, and he’d built an especially pleasing one that morning.\nBut as Stour’s mood blackened, everyone had slowly shuffled back,\nsidling around the trees and skulking through the bushes to get out of his\neyeline, loitering at the edge of the firelight and leaving a widening empty\ncircle about the King of the Northmen.\nIt seemed the only man who dared stay close was Clover himself, and\nthat was mostly ’cause he was enjoying having his feet near the warmth.\nThe Union was meant to be so very bloody civilised, but so far, the place\nwas a sea of mud. His boots had got soaked yesterday and the cold had\nworked right into his feet. Being on campaign was far from comfortable at\nthe best of times. He was damned if he was going to let Stour’s sulking\nmake him even less comfortable. And Clover reckoned you took more of a\nrisk backing away from a slavering wolf than you did calmly standing your\nground. So he sat there and slowly picked a leg of cold mutton down to the\nbone.\n“We could’ve gone last night!” snarled Stour, and he kicked a\nsmouldering branch from the fire and sent it spinning away, showering\nsparks. “Why didn’t we go last night?”\n“Couldn’t say, my king,” said Clover. “Big army to manage, I reckon.”\n“Big army to manage?” sneered the king, and he kicked out at a cookpot\nand sent it bouncing between the trees where it hit a Carl on the side of his\nknee and made him squeak with pain, though he kept smiling all the while,\nwhich was quite a feat.\nIf Stour had been an eight-year-old, he’d have got a slap from his\nmummy. Instead, he got every bastard bowing and grinning and pandering\nto him, even those he kicked cookpots at. That, of course, only made him\nrage the worse.\n“We’ve joined up with a pack o’ fools!” Stour said. The rest of ’em had"

The rest of ’em had\nbeen given no choice but to follow. “You see that fat idiot Barezin? He\ncame in gleeman’s feast-day clothes, didn’t he? You see that skinny idiot\nIsher? Looks like a fucking wilting cock. As for the bunch o’ jesters they’re\nleading.” He gave a snort that sent snot shooting out of his nose and angrily\ndashed it away. “Fucking Southerners. What was I thinking?”\nMostly that he was bored and he wanted to fight someone, Clover\nimagined, and there’d been no one big enough within arm’s reach.\n“That cunt Rikke had the right idea! Says yes then stays home in Uffrith\nfrigging herself. Thinks she can laugh at me, does she?”\nClover nibbled a few more shreds of meat from the bone. “Couldn’t\nsay.”\n“My king?” A wincing Carl was edging up, an eyeglass offered out to\nStour like he was sticking his arm in a fire.\n“What now?”\n“Reckon… you ought to see this.”\nStour snatched the eyeglass, stomped to the treeline and trained it on the\nlow hill beyond that long slope of darkened wheat, its shape clear now\nagainst the brightening sky.\n“What the fuck?” he hissed.\n“They were reinforced in the night,” said Jin. “Two regiments of King’s\nOwn. Maybe three.”\nThe sun was peeping over the valley, long shadows stretching across the\nfields. Through the round window of his eyeglass, quivering slightly with\nthe trembling of his hand, Leo could see the flags, the spears, the lines of\nmen on top of the two hills. The rocky bluff crawled with activity now, like\na distant ant heap. The long, low hill had at least twice as many soldiers on\nit as the night before. One flag in particular, black with a golden sun, flew\nabove the rest. A lord marshal’s personal standard.\n“He took me for a bloody fool,” breathed Leo. “He played me for time,\nknowing he had men on the way.”\nHe felt a sudden cold shock. Had that woman Teufel tricked them? Had\nshe been loyal to the king all along, lied about his strength then taken the\nsecrets they’d merrily blabbed to her straight back to him? Had Orso been\nwell aware of that as he smirked across the table and tried to drive a wedge\nbetween Leo and his allies? Between Leo and his own wife?\n“Fuck!” He flung the eyeglass across the hillside and it bounced once\nand clattered from one of the wagons with a tinkle of broken glass.\nShock turned to a reassuring fury that burned all the night’s doubts\naway. He was the Young Lion, damn it! He’d no business dithering when\nthere was an enemy ahead.\n“What should we do?” asked Isher, plucking at a loose thread on his\nembroidered cuff as he stared towards those suddenly well-held hills.\n“Attack!” snarled Leo. “Now!”\n“Finally!” Barezin mashed his fist into his palm. “My Gurkish Legion"

You can depend on it!”\n“I am bloody depending on it,” Leo forced through his gritted teeth.\nBarezin gave a cavalier salute, caught hold of his saddle horn, bounced a\ncouple of times and then, with some subtle shoving from one of his aides,\nhauled himself up and turned his mount towards the west.\nLeo took Isher by the shoulder. “I don’t care whether it’s a Gurkish\nlegion or a phalanx of Sipanese whores,” he hissed into his pale face, “I\nneed men up on that bluff in force and ready to attack Stoffenbeck from the\nwest as soon as possible. Do you understand?”\nIsher wiped sweat from his forehead and gave a stiff salute. “I do.” And\nhe strode somewhat unsteadily to his horse.\nLeo pulled Antaup close, pointed over the orchards towards the rocky\nhill, one flank bright with the dawn, the other cast into shadow. “First the\nOpen Council drive them back on the right and take that bluff.” He shoved\nforward with his fist, from the neat battle lines of Angland and across the\nopen fields towards Stoffenbeck. “By the time we attack Orso in the centre,\nthey’ll be in a position to outflank him.” He stabbed his finger towards the\nwheatfields, the gentle green hill beyond with those new banners at its\nsummit. “Before they shore up the centre, Stour will hit them on the left.”\nAntaup grinned as he flicked that loose lock of hair out of his face and it\ndropped straight back. “Yes, Your Grace!”\n“Let the Anglanders know!” And Leo sent Antaup charging down the\nhill with a slap on the back. “Greenway?”\nHe slouched over, giving a mockery of a Union salute. “Young Lion.”\n“Tell Stour we’re attacking from right across to left. He goes last.”\n“Last?” sneered Greenway.\n“It’s a battle plan, not a race.”\n“Don’t reckon Stour’ll like going—”\nLeo grabbed a fistful of Greenway’s cloak and snarled the words in his\nface. “He doesn’t have to like it. He just has to do it.” And he shoved the\nman away and made him slither on the dewy grass. He only just righted\nhimself before he fell, and slunk off with bad grace.\n“Might not be wise to treat him with so little respect,” murmured Jin.\n“I had a go at being wise,” snapped Leo. “It doesn’t fucking suit me.”\nJin laughed and thumped him on the shoulder. “That’s the spirit!”\nLeo looked towards the low ridge, the high bluff, the town with the\ncrescent of diggings in front, a fierce smile on his face. He liked this plan.\nSimple. Aggressive. It played to his strengths. He wished he’d done it last\nnight, but last night wasn’t coming back. They were ready now and had the\nwhole day ahead of them.

He felt like a new man.\n“We could’ve beaten him last night.” He curled his fingers into a\ntrembling fist. “But we’ll crush him today instead. Someone get my horse!”\nFools’ Errands\nO\nrso stood at the parapet of Stoffenbeck’s clock tower, trying to frown out\nmanfully to the north while feeling like an utter impostor in his gilded\narmour.\nThe mist clinging to the fields was clearing, the sun rising bright into a\nsky holding only a few lonely puffs of cloud. A rather lovely day might\nhave been in the offing. Had it not been for the thousands of heavily armed\nmen poised to murder each other within the next few hours, of course.\nThe forces of the Open Council were gathered on the far left. Yellow\nblocks, red blobs, blue wedges, bright flags streaming overhead. Their\nwondrous variety suggested a lack of coordination, but also spoke strongly\nto the breadth of the coalition against him.\nThe army of Angland was deployed below the hill on which Steebling’s\ntower-house stood. Dark, business-like blocks so ominously neat they might\nhave been drawn with a ruler. Men who last year had been heroes,\nstruggling against the Union’s enemies. Men Orso had done his best to help.\nMen he had utterly failed to help, driven now to open rebellion against him.\nOf Stour Nightfall’s Northmen there was no sign. Lurking in the woods,\nno doubt, waiting to pounce, as Northmen so loved to do. The Young Lion\nand the Great Wolf had been bitter enemies, fighting each other to the death\nbut a few months before. Now Orso had achieved the apparently impossible\nand united them in mutual hatred for him.\nBy the Fates, when did he get so many enemies?\n“I tried to do the right thing,” he murmured, striving to make sense of it.\n“Broadly. The best I could, under the circumstances. Tried to find…\nreasonable compromises?” It would have made a feeble battle cry. Forth,\nmen, to reasonable compromises!\nHe tried again. “I mean to say… I realise that I’m hesitant, occasionally\noblivious, running to fat, certainly not the most inspiring king a subject\ncould ask for but… I’m hardly despicable, am I? I’m no Glustrod. No\nMorlic the Mad.”\nGrunts and grumbles of firm denial as he glanced around the roof. But\nwhat could a king expect from his courtiers except bland agreement on\nevery point? Tunny, he noted, stayed silent.\n“If I may, Your Majesty?” offered Lord Hoff, rubbing his hands like a\nhorse-trader spying a simpleton upon whom to palm off his lamest nag.\n“The roots of this particular rebellion dig back into history. To your father’s\ntime. To his father’s time.” Mutters of agreement. “You, I fear, have been\nunfortunate enough to reap the harvest. Discontent has been swelling for\nmany years.” Heads bobbed as men nodded. “The seeds were sown in the\nwar against Black Dow. The wars against the Snake of Talins. The war\nagainst Uthman-ul-Dosht, even.”\n“Now that was a war,” came a voice."

The war\nagainst Uthman-ul-Dosht, even.”\n“Now that was a war,” came a voice.\n“Master Sulfur.” Orso was less than entirely delighted to see the magus\nstep out onto the roof of the clock tower. “You always seem to arrive at\nmoments of high drama.”\n“Never the slightest peace, Your Majesty. I have been in the North,\ndoing my best to put an end to this rebellion before it began.”\nOrso raised a brow at the thousands of armed men facing them. “With\nlimited success, it would appear.”\n“Alas, the younger generation refuses to honour the debts of the older.\nThe debts that put them where they are. My master will ensure there is a\nreckoning, depend on that.”\n“A huge comfort,” said Orso. By that point, there was every chance they\nwould all be dead. “I don’t suppose you could do to Leo dan Brock’s army\nwhat you did to the Burners at the demonstration of Curnsbick’s engine, is\nthere?”\nSulfur turned those strangely empty, different-coloured eyes upon him.\n“The magic leaks from the world, Your Majesty, and there are limits to what\neven I can achieve. An army is far beyond my powers.”\n“Just the Young Lion himself, maybe?”\n“A great risk with an uncertain outcome. My master prefers safe bets.”\nOrso puffed out his cheeks. “Why he got into banking, no doubt.”\n“That and so he could furnish you with the means to settle your\nproblems by… more traditional methods.”\n“For which I am immensely grateful, of course.” Orso had seen Sulfur\nrip a man apart with his teeth. He knew Bayaz had made a wreck of half the\nAgriont and killed thousands. He was sure Valint and Balk had done even\nmore damage in the years since, with far less spectacle. Truly, he had made\na pact with devils. But a man lost in the desert, as the Gurkish say, must\ntake such water as he is offered.\nSulfur was surveying the battlefield. “We are expecting reinforcements, I\ntake it?”\n“Imminently,” said Orso, wondering whether Lord Marshal Rucksted\nwould reach the field before they were utterly overwhelmed. Fortunately, or\nperhaps unfortunately, he was spared from having to qualify the statement\nby a discordant mishmash of bugles, horns and shouted orders floating on\nthe chill dawn.\n“They’re advancing on the left,” said Tunny.\nAt this distance, the Open Council’s varied formations appeared to move\nwith dreamlike slowness, inexorably southwards, through the patchwork of\nfields towards the tangled orchards around the river. It was hard to believe\nthat all those tiny coloured dots were men. They seemed to flow like a fluid.\nLurid shades of paint, perhaps, running together on the easel of a careless\nartist.\n“They’re attacking,” said Hoff.\nOrso gave him a withering sideways glance. “Oh, I don’t know, Lord\nChamberlain. Perhaps they’re rushing forward to surrender.”\nNo one laughed, of course, not even Orso. It did not look as though it\nwould be a day for laughs.\n“Your Majesty?” A footman had appeared in purple finery, tray balanced"

It did not look as though it\nwould be a day for laughs.\n“Your Majesty?” A footman had appeared in purple finery, tray balanced\non outstretched fingers, a selection of Visserine glassware gleaming with\nthe morning sun. “A drink?”\nThere was something faintly horrifying about a tipple while men\nmarched to their deaths. Epic disaster as light entertainment. “At a time like\nthis?” asked Orso.\nOfficers glanced at one another, raised their brows, shrugged as if to say,\nWhat better time could there be?\nOrso sighed. “I’ll take a sherry. Sherry, Master Sulfur?”\n“Not for me, Your Majesty.”\n“Of course, I forgot. Your highly specific diet…” And Orso winced as he\nlooked back towards the battlefield.\nSome of the better-disciplined formations had reached the orchards and\napparently vanished. Others had scarcely moved at all, or were stuck at\nsome hedgerow, some house, some stand of trees. Still others appeared to\nhave twisted, drifted apart, become tangled with each other. Orso and his\nroyal entourage watched in silence, sipping their drinks, while the\nmovement of the great clock marked the passage of time with its steady\ntick, tick, tick beneath their feet.\n“The forces of the Open Council appear to be in some confusion,”\nsomeone said.\nOrso laughed so hard he snorted sherry out of his nose, had to submit to\na dabbing down by his footman while he continued to helplessly giggle.\nHoff looked at him as though he had lost his reason. Perhaps he had.\n“Your Majesty?”\n“Oh, you know. Good old Open Council. You can always count on them\nto act with total disunity, disloyalty and incompetence.”\n“What are they doing?” muttered Savine, clenching her swollen fists so\ntight they trembled. “What the hell are they doing?”\nShe was no soldier, but it hardly took Stolicus himself to tell things had\nnot started well. From the chaos over there, anyone would have thought the\nOpen Council were fully engaged with the enemy rather than with some\norchards and a slow-flowing tributary of the river.\n“Seems your rebellion’s coming apart already.” Lord Steebling lifted his\ngouty leg onto a stool then sat back, grinning up at her with smug\nsatisfaction.\n“I wouldn’t count us out just yet,” she said, turning her back on him and\nstepping away.\nThe man was an utter shit, but Leo had insisted he be treated with every\ncourtesy. They were here to uphold the rights of Union citizens, after all,\nand it was Steebling’s land they were fighting on, Steebling’s house they\nwere using as their headquarters, Steebling’s bed they had been clumsily\ncoupling in last night. The memory made her feel faintly and entirely\ninappropriately aroused. Faintly aroused and badly in need of a piss both at\nonce.\nThe great wagons carrying the cannon had been held up on the clogged\nroads and were only now arriving.

Savine grimly shook her head at the thought of what\neach of those had cost to make.

She wanted desperately to be down there with him.\nBeing a powerless observer by no means suited her. But she knew no one\nwould listen to her. No one was listening to anyone. Leo caught one man in\nthe deep blue uniform of Isher’s soldiers and near dragged him from his\nsaddle.\n“What the hell is going on over there?”\n“Your Grace, it seems someone tampered with the bridges—”\n“Tampered?”\n“When the first units tried to cross the river, they collapsed—”\n“No one thought to check?” Leo grabbed Antaup by the shoulder,\nstabbing towards the orchards with a finger. “Get over there! I don’t care if\nthey have to raft men across. I don’t care if they have to build new bloody\nbridges! Get over there and make sure those bastards move!”\n“Best stay back, Lady Savine.” Broad stepped carefully in front of her as\nAntaup thundered past, teeth gritted. Zuri slipped a hand around her elbow\nand guided her ever so gently away from the milling horses, to a clear spot\non the hillside.\n“Shall I have Haroon bring you a chair?” she asked.\n“How could I sit through this?” snapped Savine, standing with jaw, fists\nand bladder clenched in a paralysis of helpless fury.\nIsher, Barezin and the rest were making an utter turd of it. She had been\nso worried about their loyalty she had not given nearly enough attention to\ntheir competence. She tore open the button at her collar. She could not get a\nproper breath.\n“Calm,” she whispered. “Calm, calm—”\nShe jumped at an almighty crash. Someone dived aside with a\ndespairing cry as a cannon slid from its wagon and thudded to the turf,\nrolling down the hill and leaving a trail of wreckage, a tangle of ropes and\npulleys dragged through a campfire after it.\nSomewhere behind her, over the madness, she could hear Lord\nSteebling’s laughter.\n“Now, Arch Lector?” asked the chief engineer, breathless.\nPike gazed down towards the orchards. He couldn’t have been calmer if\nhe’d been timing an egg. “A little longer.” He leaned over to murmur to\nVick, “I sent a few men down to the river last night to chisel the keystones\nfrom the bridges. I do admire a skilled mason, don’t you?”\nVick had nothing to say. Her appreciation for stonework felt rather\nbeside the point.\n“I doubt they’ll take the weight of more than a few men,” said Pike. “A\ncompany of soldiers trying to cross will soon find themselves swimming.

The wind picked up, whipping\nstreams of smoke from the slow-burning match-cords in the hands of the\nnervous boys beside each cannon. “Not quite yet.”\n“How long’ll he wait?” whispered Tallow, voice squeaky with fear.\nVick silently shook her head. From where they stood, she could just see\nthe top of the clock tower. Hard to believe how little time had passed since\nthe Open Council’s troops began to move. The trees on the far bank were\nswarming with soldiers now, their order entirely gone, columns crowding\nhaphazardly in from behind to add their weight to the confusion. But the\nnear bank still looked as peaceful as it had at dawn.\n“Now, Arch Lector?” begged the engineer. Not so much that he wanted\nto do it, as that he couldn’t stand the tension of waiting.\nPike paused, considering the chaos around the river, hands clasped\nbehind his back. “Now,” he said.\nThe man looked taken aback, as though he’d only just realised what he’d\nbeen asking for the last half-hour. He licked his lips, then turned unsteadily\ntowards the north.\n“Cannon will fire in order from my right,” he roared, holding up his fist,\n“and continue firing until the order is given to cease!”\nThe aproned engineers, the burly men who handled the shot and powder,\nthe boys who held the poles and sponges, all started to screw pellets of rag\ninto their ears. Pike was doing the same.\nStiffly, cautiously, the engineer at the first cannon took match-cord from\npowder boy and gingerly touched the flame to the pan. The crew all turned\naway, hunching down, covering their heads. Vick winced. There was a\npathetic little splutter and a puff of sparks.\n“That’s it?” said Tallow, looking up.\nThe cannon jolted on its trestles, fire spurting from its mouth. There was\na thunderous, barking explosion, as painfully loud as anything Vick ever\nheard. A moment later, the next cannon fired, and the next.\nShe shrank down against the hillside, clapping her hands against the\nsides of her head, and felt her skull buzz, and her palms tremble, and the\nvery ground shake.\nFelt like the end of the world.\n“He wants you to hold,” growled out the Young Lion’s pet Northman,\nWhitewater whatever, “until he gives the—”\nAnd everyone turned at a great low rumble.

There was a flap and flutter\nas birds took off from the trees, then another rumble, and another, like\nthunder close at hand, loud enough Clover could feel the earth quiver\nthrough the soles of his boots. But then, they were a little worn.\n“What’s this?” snarled Stour, striding to the treeline and staring off\nacross the wheatfields. Far away, on the big bluff over on the other side of\nthe town, puffs of smoke were going up and floating out across the valley.\n“Fire engines, I reckon,” murmured Clover. A few of the older fellows\nlooked as unhappy about it as he was. They’d seen ’em used at Osrung,\nmaybe, and hadn’t much enjoyed the experience.\nBut Stour had slept through Osrung in his mother’s belly. His eyes shone\nas he watched the smoke puff out. “They call ’em cannons now,” he\nmurmured, then turned about. “Get the men ready.”\n“Eh?” said Greenway.\n“You heard me.” Stour grinned out across that sea of windswept wheat\ntowards that sloping green ridge with the flags at the top. “I want that hill.”\nClover winced. What the hell Stour planned to do with a hill in the\nmiddle of Midderland was anyone’s guess. Graze sheep on it? But the Great\nWolf wanted it. So that was that.\nWhitewater was staring at ’em all like they’d parted from their senses.\nWhich they probably had, some months before, when they all consented to\nStour being king. “Didn’t you hear me? The Young Lion wants you to—”\n“I fucking heard you, boy.” Stour’s eyes slid across to him. “But I’ve\nhad quite enough o’ the Young Lion’s pleasure.” It was almost a surprise\nthat menacing slaver didn’t drip from his teeth. “He wants me to stop, he\ncan come over here and stop me himself. No? Didn’t fucking think so.” He\nturned to roar into the trees. “Weapons, lads! War cries, you bastards! Time\nfor you fuckers to fight!”\nAnd there was a great clattering and hissing as swords were drawn and\nshields raised and spears hefted. A great growl and murmur of war curses\nand prayers to the dead, shouted orders echoing from further off as the call\nto arms spread down the long line. A great jingle and rustle as mailed\nwarriors crunched through the brush to the very edge of the trees. Stour\nbrushed Brock’s man out of his way and strode forward himself into the\ngolden wheat, drawing his sword, and his gilded bastards crowded after, all\nfalling over themselves to show how thirsty they were for blood.\n“By all the fucking dead,” whispered Whitewater, staring after Stour and\ndragging at his red beard so hard he looked fit to tear it out of his jaw.\n“Look at the sunny side.” And Clover slapped a sympathetic hand down\non his shoulder. “After today, one way or another, I doubt you’ll have to\ndeal with the idiot again.” He puffed out his cheeks as he drew his sword."

But surely not the last.\nA stone whizzed over the orchards and into the dirt, sending up a spray\nof mud. Another struck a tree and Leo flinched at the great cloud of\nsplintered wood that rained down on the cowering men, now pinned more\nhopelessly than ever. A moment later, the great crack of the impact echoed\nacross the fields.\n“Damn it,” hissed Leo. If they waited for the Open Council to get across\nthat river they’d be waiting till nightfall.\n“What the hell?” he heard Mustred say, gazing over to their left. Leo\nfollowed his eyes.\nA great mass of Northmen had emerged from the trees and was wading\nsteadily through the ripe wheat towards the low ridge. Carls, with their\nround shields, and bright mail, and the sunlight glinting on the blades of axe\nand sword and spear.\nLeo stared in mute amazement. He couldn’t even find the words to\nswear.\nThe plan had been so simple. How could it have come apart so badly?\nConfusion in combat was one thing, but he’d lost control of his army before\nthey’d made the slightest contact with the enemy. He stared over at the\nOpen Council’s self-inflicted chaos on the right, then at Stour’s self-\ninflicted chaos on the left, then at the earthworks straight ahead. He took a\nlong breath.\n“Everyone!” His voice sounded surprisingly calm. He’d always been at\nhis best when there was only one thing to do. “Sound the advance!”\nMustred leaned closer, waving doubtfully towards Stoffenbeck.\n“They’re well dug in, Your Grace. They’re ready for us. Without the Open\nCouncil flanking them—”\nLeo clapped the old lord on the shoulder. “We’ll have to outfight the\nbastards.” He turned in his saddle to roar at the men around him. “Lift the\nstandard, lads! Beat the drums! It’s time!”\nHe saw Savine standing on the hillside. He smiled, and raised his arm,\nand gave her a last wave.\nThen he wrenched his horse around towards the enemy.\nBugles blared, and with a mighty tramp that shook the troubled ground, the\narmy of Angland began to move south.\nEven back here the noise never stopped now. Jolting wagons, bellowed\norders, thumping hooves, the throbbing fury of the cannons. Someone kept\nscreaming, high and thin and broken. Behind them, far from the fighting.\nAccident among the supplies, maybe.\nOver on the left, the great mass of Northmen were forging ahead\nthrough the golden wheat, leaving it brown and flattened behind them. Over\non the right, fires were burning in the orchards, black smoke from the trees\nmeeting white smoke from the cannons and throwing a grey shroud over the\nwhole battlefield."

A tang of Gurkish Fire, and metal, and fear,\nand shit. Someone had dug a latrine pit way too close to camp and a couple\nof slumping wattle screens weren’t doing much to hide the sight of men’s\nwaste, let alone the smell of it.\n“Bloody traitors!” roared that old bastard with the gouty leg. “The\nKing’s Own’ll cut you to pieces!”\nBroad frowned up the hill. “He’s a charmer.”\n“Lord Steebling owns most of this land,” said Savine through gritted\nteeth. “Leo says we’re here to support his rights, not to take them away.”\n“That’s not why I’m here.”\n“Why are you here?” asked Zuri.\nSame question Broad asked himself when he climbed the ladder, time\nafter time, and men looked at him like he was mad. He’d given up on\ncauses in Styria. He’d given Savine all he owed and more when he risked\nhis life speaking to Judge. He’d never promised to fight. Promised not to, in\nfact. And yet here he was.\n“Gunnar,” said Savine. “Could you do something for me?”\n“I can try.”\n“Follow my husband.” She stared off to the south. Towards where the\nfighting would soon be hottest, sliding her hands around her belly. She\nlooked strangely helpless, suddenly, in the midst of all this. “Try… to make\nsure…”\n“I understand.” Trying to keep a man alive in a battle was the very\ndefinition of a fool’s errand, but it would hardly be his first. “Just one thing\nI’ve got to do first. Think you could look after these for me?” He unhooked\nhis lenses from his ears, gently folded them and handed them to Zuri. She’d\nalways struck him as a woman you could trust with something delicate.\nThen he strode up the blurred hillside towards the dark smudge of the\ntower, carefully rolling up his sleeves. Helps to have a routine.\nSteebling squinted as Broad’s shadow cast him into darkness. “We\nSteeblings aren’t easily intimidated, you— Ah!” He squawked as Broad\ncaught him by the ear and dragged him from his chair.\nThe old nobleman hopped and slithered as he was marched back down\nthe hill, whimpering whenever his weight went onto his gouty leg. Broad\nstrode to those wicker screens and kicked one out of the way. He was glad\nfor once that he couldn’t really see, so he didn’t have to look at the\noverflowing latrine pit in all its glory. But he could certainly smell it.\nTo Steebling, plainly, it was a new experience. He shrank away, one arm\nacross his face. “What’re you—”\nBroad shoved him in.\nHe vanished below the surface for a moment then bobbed up, his velvet\ncap lost somewhere under there and his grey hair plastered to his face with"

Told himself a good man has to fight.\nSame things he’d told himself when he headed off to Styria. But he knew a\nbattle was no place for good men.\nHe took a long breath through his nose and snorted it out with a growl.\nSnorted it out like a bull.\nWhen he wept at his own front door, back in the loving embrace of his\nfamily, he’d thought he was done with blood. Thought nothing could ever\nget him back onto a battlefield. But it seemed Judge knew him better than\nhe knew himself. Trouble was like hunger to him. Stuffing your face till\nyou’re sick one day doesn’t mean you won’t want lunch the next. All you\ndo is sharpen your appetite. And here he was, in spite of all his empty\npromises, back at the table again with his cutlery ready, clamouring to be\nserved.\nHe slid the warhammer from his belt and felt the steel haft tight in his\ngrip. Fit there, like a key in a lock. He bared his teeth and walked faster.\nThe Little People\nP\neck felt a slap on his shoulder and he worked his eyes open, peeled his\nhands from his ears and—once he’d worked out which way was up, which\ntook longer than you’d think—looked up.\nSergeant Meyer stared back, white lines through the black soot around\nhis eyes where he’d been squeezing ’em shut and one side of his beard a\nlittle singed, mouth moving like he was shouting at the top of his lungs.\nThrough the rag-buds in Peck’s ears and the whomp and burble of the other\ncannons and the rush of his own breath and the thudding of his heart and the\nconstant high whine which seemed to be everywhere now, he heard a hint\nof Meyer’s voice.\n“Sponge ’er, Peck!”\n“Oh.” He stumbled up and nearly fell and only kept his balance\nclutching on to one of the trestles. “Yes.” Where’d he put the sponge? He\nsnatched it up, tearing some grass up with it. “Sir.” Where’d he put the\nbucket? He nearly tripped over it twisting around looking for it. Why was\nhe even saying yes? He couldn’t hear himself. How could anyone else?\nThe air was thick with the stink of Gurkish Fire, his mouth sticky with\nthe tang of powder, his throat raw and his eyes smarting. At times, he could\nhardly see the next cannon along. Their crews were ghosts, crawling around\ntheir pieces, swabbing ’em, towelling ’em, loading ’em, feeding ’em\npowder, tending to their every screaming whim like a bunch of filth-"

Thick smoke curled from its mouth and he slopped\nwater out of the bucket, dashed the crust of smouldering powder away from\nthe maw, hefted his pole then flinched as a cannon a couple down the row\nfired, flame spouting, ground shaking.\nIt had all been such good fun at the Siege School. Good luck to end up\nthere. Better’n working in a mill. Damn sight safer, too. Didn’t seem safer\nnow, needless to say.\nSomething better not thought about.\n“Sponge ’er, Peck!”\nHe didn’t like calling the cannons “her.” Like they were women. Added\na hint of the disgusting to the already unpleasant. Naught motherly about\nthe bastard things that he could see. Murder’s men’s work mostly, after all.\nThe sponge streamed black water as he shoved it into the cannon’s\nsmoking barrel and gave it a ramming, spraying himself each time. He was\nsoaked with sponge-water and smeared head to toe with soot and his\nshirtsleeves torn and flapping wet at his chafing wrists, but you leave even a\nsmear of burning powder behind and when they put the new charge in, the\nlot of you will be blown to hell.\nSomething else better not thought about.\nHe could see soldiers below them, through the drifting smoke. Lord\nCrant’s men, he thought. A ragged-looking regiment, stretched out crooked\nacross the hillside. They’d tried to dig in but had about three good shovels\nbetween ’em and the rocky ground wasn’t offering much help. No one was.\nThey were cowering now, at the thunder of the cannons behind them and\nthe masses of enemy somewhere in front. Trapped betwixt hell and hail, as\nPeck’s granny used to say. They’d flung their weapons down to cover their\nears, faces twisted with pain and terror. Peck had seen a couple try to run\nand be dragged back to their posts. Seemed a feeble sort of defence, if those\nrebels ever got across that river and up the rocky hillside.\nOne more thing best not thought about. Awful lot of those in a battle.\nLike the Arch Lector, standing in his pure white coat on the summit of\nthe hill. That hard-faced woman, too. Most frightening pair o’ bastards he\never saw.

Streaks\nthrough the soot on his face. Wasn’t clear if it was the smoke in his eyes or\nhe was hurt or he was crying ’cause this was so horrible.

But the poor bastards their piece was pointing at were\nanother o’ those things it was better not to think about.\nAt a time like this, best not to think at all.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut.\nThere was a sound like a whip cracking in Suval’s ear, there was a great\nshower of stinging splinters and he cringed as something bounced off his\nback. A branch fell from a tree nearby and crashed down among the\nwreckage.\n“God help us,” he whispered, lifting his head. Someone was crying.\nSomeone was shouting. Someone was burning. He saw him totter writhing\ndown to the water’s edge and flop in. Someone was trying to drag a limp\nman back by his armpits. Suval saw him fall with the wounded man on top\nof him, and struggle up, and struggle on. Desperate to save his friend’s life.\nOr desperate for an excuse to save his own.\nSuval picked up his dented helmet with trembling hands, put it on,\ndumping dirt on his head and hardly noticing. He spent a moment trying to\nfasten the buckle on the chinstrap before he realised it was broken. He\nstared about, no idea where his spear had fallen. But there was a sword\nnearby, so he picked that up instead. He had no idea how to use a sword.\nHe’d never even held one before.\nMurezin had said they would never have to fight, only dress up for some\nvain man who wanted to say he had a Gurkish Legion, and they had\nlaughed about it while they drank bad tea together. You could not find good\ntea anywhere in this damned country. Murezin had been wrong about the\nfighting. But Murezin had also fallen in the river when the bridge collapsed,\nalong with several others. A couple had washed up drowned on the bank,\nbut of Murezin there was no sign.\nSuval had said it was just as well the Gurkish Legion would not have to\nfight because he had never fought in his life and was not Gurkish and,\nindeed, barely even spoke their language. But it could not be worse than\nliving in the slums in Adua where no one would hire you if you had a dark\nface. He had been a scribe in Tazlik, where the sea breeze had cooled his\nclean little office. He had copied religious texts, mostly, with some\naccountancy work, which was all very boring but paid well. How he prayed\nnow that he might live to be bored again. He hunched down at another ear-\nsplitting crack somewhere over on the left.

One sat silent, in the dappled\nshade of the trees, looking exceedingly surprised, blood streaming down his\nface. Suval knew him a little. He had been a tailor in Ul-Khatif. No sense of\nhumour. But senses of humour were not at a premium here.\nHe turned over and shuffled through a slurry of fallen fruit to a twisted\ntree trunk where several other Kantics were sheltering, along with a Union\nman in the oddest uniform, half-green, half-brown. He realised as he got\nclose that the man was dead, and the brown half was blood from his arm,\nwhich was utterly mangled. He pushed the corpse away with his shoe and\nwriggled into the place it had occupied, and did not even feel ashamed at\nhis mistreatment of the dead.\nHe could ask God for forgiveness later.\nSomeone offered him a flask and he drank gratefully, handed it back.\nSmoke wafted across the river. Some men had rafted over and now they\nwere huddled trembling on the far bank with one spear between them, one\nof them pale and bleeding, the raft come apart and its timbers drifting away.\nNow and again a body would float past, face up or face down, turning\ngently with the current.\nFurious shouting behind them, the sound of terrified horses. They were\ndriving wagons through the carnage. They had rolled one into the river\nalready. Trying to make a bridge, so they could get across. And what?\nFight? Madness. All madness. A man they had all thought dead gave a\ngurgling scream as a wagon’s wheel crunched over his leg.\n“God help us,” whispered Suval, but God was not listening. No more\nthan He had been when the riots started in Tazlik and his office was robbed\nand set on fire and he and his family spent all they had on passage to the\nUnion. Another crash, and he wriggled back against the tree as bits of leaf\nand twig rained down.\nSomething spattered his face. Was it blood? Was he wounded? Oh, God,\nwas this the end? He held his trembling fingertips up before his eyes.\nJust plum pulp. Just rotten fruit. He wanted to laugh. But he also wanted\nto cry. His helmet fell off and he jammed it on again, back to front.\nThere was a big fat man in a big red uniform heavy with golden ropes.\nThe one who had smiled from horseback as they set off a week before. A\nthin man with combed-back black hair was shouting something at him,\nstabbing a finger at the broken bridge, at the wagons. He wanted them to\ncross. But how could they cross with the world on fire? How could they\neven think of moving? He might as well have demanded they fly to the\nmoon.\nSuval was no soldier. He copied texts.

Never liked any of these Open Council\nbastards. Never trusted them. Flatterers and blowhards. But somehow, he’d\nbought into the big talk. And it was too late now. No choice but to work\nwith what they had.\nHe grabbed Barezin by a fistful of braid and hissed the words one at a\ntime. “Just… get… them… across!” He pulled his horse around. “Now!”\nHe had to head back to Leo. Tell him he couldn’t rely on these fools.\nHe shoved a low branch aside and was out from among the trees. Things\nwere no less confused in the open. Dead and wounded everywhere. One\ndissolving unit was half moving forward, half back, breaking open in the\nmiddle and scattering yellow-jacketed men in every direction. A riderless\nhorse frisked maddened through the chaos, empty stirrups bouncing at its\nflanks.\nAntaup saw a flicker at the corner of his eye then dirt showered up in the\nmidst of a column. Dirt and weapons and bits of people in a flailing cloud.\nMen were flung down like dolls, flung themselves down, covering their\nheads.\nAntaup only just kept his seat as his horse swerved around the shattered\ncolumn, soil showering down on him, pinging from his saddle, screams of\ninjured men fading under the drumming of hooves.\nThat had been close.\nOff to the west, through the haze of smoke, he caught a glimpse of more\norganised lines. Blue-uniformed troops. Isher’s regiments, maybe, spared\nthe worst of the cannon fire, still keeping some shape. But as he galloped\nacross the fields, he saw nothing but an exhibition of cowardice. Every tree\nhad a little clump of men huddled behind it, fighting each other for more\ncover. Men without weapons. Men without purpose. Wounded crawling for\nthe rear.\nA nervous company had gathered at the side of a farmhouse. You could\nsee their terror as they gazed across the body-speckled fields towards the\nburning orchards and the fuming hill beyond. An officer rode up and down\nin front of them, waving his sword, screaming himself hoarse. “Forward!\nFor pity’s sake, forward!” But like a stubborn herd of goats refusing the\nshepherd’s commands, they wouldn’t be moved.\nAntaup gritted his teeth and dug in his heels. All bloody amateurs. And\ngood men would be paying for it.\nHe jumped a hedge, jolting down, saw a set of men hiding on the other\nside in the midst of pulling off their brightly coloured jackets.

He’d always known what\nthey were. Nothing to be proud of but they were good men still. Leo could\nbe so bloody stubborn. Once he had an idea in his head, there was no\nshaking it free.\n“Out of the way!” he roared, men flattening themselves against the\nrailings of the wooden bridge as he clattered across. One messenger\nscarcely flung himself aside in time, a flash of his wide eyes, a snatch of his\nshocked whoop as Antaup whipped past him and on towards Steebling’s\ntower-house.\nHe was working up a new story. Something to really gild his reputation.\nA nobleman’s wife, this time. Lady something or other. Probably better not\nto think up a name, that could get him in trouble later. I’ll take it to my\ngrave and all that. Mysterious older woman. Terribly wealthy. Frisson of\ndanger. Husband couldn’t get it hard any more. They’d swallow it whole.\nAntaup, you dog!

He could see the\ndust from the formations as they crossed the stubbled fields to the south.\n“Damn it,” he whispered, giving his horse a moment to rest and easing\nhis helmet back to wipe his sweaty forehead.\nHad Leo got impatient? Hardly the first time. Or had something forced\nhis hand? He felt a guilty pricking of nostalgia for the days when Lady\nFinree had been in command. That sense of calm control as she considered\nthe maps, the men, the terrain. No place for a woman, maybe, but no one\never doubted that she knew exactly what she was doing. That she knew\nexactly what everyone else should be doing. Now no one seemed to have\nthe faintest idea.\nHe pushed down an unfamiliar feeling of panic. Get to Leo. Tell him\nwhat was happening. Do his duty. Like Ritter and good old Barniva had, if\nthat was what it took. He pushed on south, towards the dust clouds, the\nrows of glinting steel. The buildings of Stoffenbeck grew closer through the\ngloom. The tall clock tower. He tore on past clusters of wounded men, past\nstretcher-bearers, past wagons laden with supplies.\nHe noticed bolts poking from the stubbled fields to either side now. All\npointing at the same angle. Within flatbow range, then. Leo would be where\nthe danger was, of course.

He took a whooping breath, clutching at nothing,\ndriven out in a great groan as he hit the ground. The world tumbled and\njolted as he rolled, bounced, tumbled and slid to a stop.\nHe lay there, looking at the sky for a moment.\nThe sun a bright smudge against the clouds. Peaceful.\nHe came back to himself with a jolt. He moved his arms and legs,\nwriggled his fingers. A couple of bruises perhaps, but otherwise uninjured.\nThe ladies of the Union and, indeed, the world, could breathe again. That\nhad been an exceedingly close thing.\nHis horse lay on its side, kicking weakly, a flatbow bolt buried in its\nflank.\n“You absolute bastards!” he roared at no one in particular.\nCanlan pulled the trigger and sent another bolt flying towards the neat\nblocks of Anglanders.\nHe didn’t wait to see where it came down. That wasn’t his business.\n“Load!” shouted that arsehole of a lieutenant, barely old enough for a\nbeard.\n“Arsehole,” mouthed Canlan as he lowered his bow and started to crank.\nDrum gave a little snigger, but he was easily amused. “Let’s have some\nmore bolts over here!” he roared over his shoulder.\n“They’ll come when we need ’em.” In Canlan’s experience, it didn’t\nreally help thinking about where the bolts came from and certainly not\nwhere they were going. And Canlan had a lot of experience. Been a soldier\nall his life, more or less. He’d shot flatbow bolts in every significant war the\nUnion had been involved in. He’d shot ’em at Gurkish and Northmen and\nStyrians and Stariklanders. He’d shot ’em at Ghosts on the barren plains, at\npirates on the rolling sea, even at some Imperials, once, in a desultory\nexchange of arrows outside of arrow range somewhere near the border of\nthe Near Country. Now he was shooting ’em at Anglanders, who in every\nway that counted should’ve been on his side.\nThe string was cranked all the way now and he hefted the bow, plucked\nup a bolt, slotted it home, all smooth and practised. He paused a moment,\nwondering how many bolts he’d shot in his life. But his job wasn’t to count\n’em, just to put ’em in the air, calmly and carefully and quickly as possible.\nHe lifted the bow to his shoulder, knocked the dowel out of the trigger,\nlined up on the ranks of marching pikemen, their armour gleaming dully in\nthe sun as they came on. Gave him a worried feeling, for a moment, seeing\n’em like that. Weren’t quite close enough to make out their faces. Weren’t\nquite close enough to tell who they were. But they soon would be. He\nfrowned as he lifted the bow to adjust for distance. So he was looking\ntowards the sky, rather than towards the men. That was better. Who they\nwere wasn’t his business.\n“Shoot!” said that arsehole of a lieutenant, and Canlan pulled the trigger,"

Armour was a good thing. Armour was a very good\nthing.\n“Come on,” someone was growling, just beside him. “Come on.”\nBloody hell, they were getting close now. Over the shoulders of the\nthree ranks in front, he caught a glimpse of the enemy’s lines. A drystone\nwall, he thought. Some tree trunks with stakes hammered into them, poking\nout in all directions. Some trenches, maybe. Glitter of steel as a gap in the\nclouds passed overhead.\nA man fell, screaming. As he looked around, Starling saw he had a bolt\nin his face. A horrible red flash of it before he went down under the\nstumbling men, and someone near tripped over his pike as he dropped it,\neveryone wobbling and clanking into each other.\n“Close up!” roared Longridge. “Close up the ranks there!”\nStarling found he was marching with his eyes slightly narrowed. A\nshield would’ve been a very good thing, too, but damn, the pike was so\nheavy, there was no way he could’ve managed both.\n“Forward, men!” Starling glanced over his shoulder. The Young Lion\nhimself! On his great warhorse with his officers around him and his sword\ndrawn. A bloody hero, like in the storybooks. Starling joined up ’cause of\nwhat that man had done at Red Hill. And beating Stour Nightfall in the\nCircle, and all. He’d seen the way the girls gasped when they heard the tale\ntold and thought, Bloody hell, that’s the job for me.\nStarling puffed his chest and lifted his pike a little higher as the Young\nLion rode past, but he was soon lost in the dust, and Starling’s pike drooped\nagain. Shit, the thing was heavy. You were surprised how light it was at\nfirst, but once you’d been carrying it a while, damn thing got heavier every\nstep. He coughed. So much dust. Spat, accidently spat down himself, spit all\ndown his breastplate, but what difference did that make? Wasn’t as if he\ncould stop to wipe it off. He was wearing gauntlets. And they weren’t on\nparade any more.\n“Come on, come on, come on,” came that voice. Couldn’t tell who it\nwas but he wished they’d shut up.\nBloody hell, they were getting close now. From the shouting over on the\nleft, he reckoned the fighting had already started there. He flinched as a\ncouple more bolts pinged down, rattled from helmets. He’d never fought in\na battle before.

Had a\ncouple of brawls, one where he threw the Widow Smiler’s son in the\nmillpond, but they’d been done so fast. Some harsh words and some\njostling and all over in a few silly angry moments. This was nothing like it.\nSo big, you were carried along, helpless, like a twig by a river. And so slow.\nSo gradual. So impersonal. All that time to think about it. More like a\nformal dance than a brawl. He’d much rather have been at a dance, all in\nall. Didn’t know how to dance, but then he didn’t know how to do this,\neither.\nWished he was in the front rank, so he could see where he was going.\nThen he caught sight of where they were going. That drystone wall, and\nmen standing there, lowering their own pikes, and bloody hell was he glad\nhe wasn’t in the front rank. Everyone packed in so tight. No room, no room\nat all. Sort of a comfort, sort of a fear. Men protecting you, brothers at your\nshoulder, but how could you get out? You couldn’t. That was the whole\npoint.\n“Lower pikes!” roared Longridge. “Ready!” Grunting and scraping as\nmen towards the front levelled their weapons, a gleaming forest of points.\nBloody hell, they were getting close now. He caught a glimpse of the\nenemy. Pikes and full armour. Open helmets so he could see their faces.\nYoung faces and old. Scared faces and bared teeth. A fellow with a big\nmoustache. Another smiling—smiling at a time like this. Another with tears\non his face. Looked a lot like they did, really. Like they were advancing at a\nbloody mirror. It was mad, wasn’t it? It was mad. He had nothing against\nthese fools, that he had to try to kill them, and for damn sure he’d done\nnothing to them that they should want to kill him. Unless the Widow\nSmiler’s son happened to be over there.\n“Come on! Come on!” snapped that bastard beside him. Everyone had\nstarted growling, snarling, grunting, steeling themselves for the slow\ncontact, and the tips of their pikes clicked against the tips of the enemy’s,\nand the shafts met, and scraped, and slid, closer and closer. A thicket of\nthem, slipping and knocking against each other, and deadly metal on the\nend.\nSomeone screamed on the other side. Someone gave a wail on theirs.\nNow they stopped walking. Boots mashing at the dirt. Starling pressed up\ntight against the backplate of the man in front, felt someone press up tight\nagainst him from behind. His pike had met something, he thought, but he\ncouldn’t tell what. No idea what the hell he was pushing at. He tried to look\nover the shoulder of the man in front. Tried to lift his pike high and push it\ndownwards, but bloody hell, the weight of it, his shoulders were burning,\nhaft knocking against all the others.\n“Push!” roared Captain Longridge. “Push! Kill the bastards!”\nBloody hell, the noise. The growling and spitting and swearing, the"

The growling and spitting and swearing, the\nsqueal and grind of tortured metal and wood, now and again a scream or a\nwhimper or a begging gurgle.\n“No!” someone shouted. “No! No! No! No!” Getting higher and higher\neach time until it became a mad shriek.\nBloody hell, it was hard work, harder work than anything he’d ever done\nand for no reward but dead men. He snarled and shoved and strained and\nfelt the sweat springing out of his forehead.\n“Heave!” roared Longridge. “Heave, damn it!”\nStarling saw the blade coming. The man in front pulled his head out of\nthe way and it slid past his face while he stared at it cross-eyed. He tried to\ntwist away but he was stuck fast. Packed in like sticks in a bundle. If he’d\npicked his feet up off the ground, he’d have been held there by the pressure\nof the men all around him. The blade kept coming, or maybe he was carried\ntowards it, and the point touched his breastplate and scraped against it.\nThere was a squealing and it made a long, jagged scratch on the metal, right\nthrough the embossed hammers of Angland.\n“Come on! Come on!”\nHe strained and struggled and rammed desperately with his own pike,\nbut he couldn’t even see who this one belonged to. Could hardly move his\nhead, let alone anything else. All crushed in so tight.\n“Fuck!” he snarled. “Shit! Fuck!” He twisted and kicked ever more\ndesperately, and the bright point of the blade scraped sideways across his\nbreastplate, caught on the metal lip near his armpit. He stared down at it,\nhardly daring to breathe, begging it to somehow hold there. He let go of his\npike, tried desperately to twist around but couldn’t even pull his right hand\nfree, could only get the faintest, useless grip on the shaft between finger and\nthumb of his left.\n“Come on!”\nThen with a groan the man beside him shifted, and the point jerked free,\nand it slid under Starling’s shoulderplate and ever so gradually pierced the\npadded jacket he wore underneath.\n“Push!” yelled Longridge, and the men behind pushed at him, and\npushed at him, and pushed him onto the blade.\nHe gave a snarl through his gritted teeth when it pricked him. Just a cold\npinch, and then a biting, and a worse, and his snarl got higher and higher\nuntil it was a desperate, slobbering shriek, an impossible, unbearable pain\ncutting through his chest.\nLake just shoved. Didn’t know what he was shoving at, he just shoved.\nHow could anyone know anything?\nBe a man, his father had told him as he saw him off.\nDamn it, his pike was stuck. He couldn’t even tell on what. Lodged in\nsome Anglander or stuck in the mud or tangled with the wall. He gritted his\nteeth and wrenched and twisted but it wouldn’t come free.\n“Come on!” someone was shrieking. “Come on!” But he couldn’t even\ntell which side it came from."

He shoved at\nhis pike again, shoved at it, but it was shoving back at him now. Far as he\ncould tell, beyond the ranks in front the enemy were crowding in closer. No\nend to them. Clouds had come across the sun and their armour had a dull\nsheen to it now instead of a glitter. The glitter was off the whole business.\n“Get off!” The man on his right kept shouldering him. He shoved with\nhis elbow, shoved the best he could, tried to look round, and realised the\nfellow was dead. Or as near dead as made no difference, head flopping\nsideways with his helmet skewed across his face and his eyes rolled back\nand his tongue hanging out and a great crimson drool of blood down his\nchin.\nBe a man.\nThen everything jolted. Lake never saw why. There was a terrible pain\nin the side of his face. So terrible and so sudden he vomited. Spat sick.\nSomething in his eye. Coughed and spluttered and groaned. His helmet had\nfallen off. He was on the ground. How’d that happen? The pain in his face.\nBoots kicking at him.\nHe started crawling through a forest of shuffling and stomping legs, light\nflickering, sound muffled. He pulled his glove off with his teeth, felt at his\nface with trembling fingers. Sticky. Was he wounded? Cries and snarls and\nyells. He clutched at a leg. Dead men down here. The pain of it. Was he\nwounded? Was it bad? He couldn’t see. Tried to open his eye but he\ncouldn’t see.\n“Help,” he whimpered. No one could hear him. Be a man.\nHe clutched at the mud, dragged himself back. Through the boots,\nthrough the legs. Something thudded into his ribs, rolled him over, a boot\ncaught the side of his face as it came down and he shoved at it, punched at\nit, dragged himself on through the feet and the mud and the corpses.\nBe a man. What did that even mean?\n“Help!” he squealed, hands clutched to his bloody face, and he felt\nhimself caught by the wrists and dragged back.\nIt took all her strength to pull him out from there. Grown men are heavy, let\nalone armoured ones. Ariss gritted her teeth and heaved on his wrists as\nhard as she could. This was no time to be gentle. Then her foot slipped and\nshe went down in the mud with him half on top of her. Hardly mattered, she\nwas filthy as a miner already, her apron spattered with dirt, spotted with\nblood."

She’d almost complained when she first\nsaw how rough he was with them. Like he was hefting sacks of coal. She’d\nsoon learned that delicacy did no one any good. She stumbled to the foot of\nthe stretcher, caught hold of the handles. Scalla had undone the buckle on\nthe wounded man’s helmet and tossed it bouncing away, turned around to\ngrab his handles and looked over his shoulder to meet her eye. “One,\ntwo…”\nShe growled as she lifted the foot end and off they went, bones jolting,\nteeth rattling, shoulders burning with the effort as they jogged towards the\noutskirts of town. Chaos here, messengers dashing, other stretcher-bearers\nstumbling back and forth, boys scrambling with armfuls of flatbow bolts.\nAriss had wanted to do something before she married. Wanted to do\nsomething real. Something to be proud of. Her uncle had fought in\nGurkhul, long ago. He’d tried to warn her.\n“So a battle’s no place for a woman?” she’d snapped at him.\n“A battle’s no place for anyone,” he’d said, and she’d walked out.\nNow she forced herself to look at the man on the stretcher. There was a\ngreat long slash down his face to his throat. She couldn’t really see how bad\nit was for all the blood. She didn’t really want to see how bad it was. But\nthe blood was not a good sign. It was pouring out of him. Pooling in the\nstretcher around his head. Soaking through the canvas. Dripping to the dirt\nwhere her feet mashed it into the mud. So much blood. You’d be amazed\nhow much a man holds.\nHe made this long, dull groan with every outbreath. Not even pained.\nHalf-witted. Mindless.\n“Shush,” she crooned, but it came out panicked and jolting with her\nfootfalls.\nShe’d fondly imagined a woman’s voice might help calm them, the way\nit had in Spillion Sworbreck’s book about that dauntless frontier girl that\nshe’d found so inspiring. But nothing calmed them. Nothing but death,\nanyway. She’d pictured dabbing sweaty brows, and water gratefully\nreceived, and binding the odd wound. Discreet wounds. Neat wounds.\nNicks and scratches. Instead she saw bodies peeled open, hacked into, bent\nbackwards, leaking their contents. Bodies that could never heal. Bodies that\nhardly looked like bodies any more.\nHer uncle had been right. She’d made a terrible mistake.\nThey came to the garden where the wounded were laid out, sending up\nan awful chorus of pain and despair. Better than the wet screams coming\nfrom the tent where they did the surgery, though.\nShe set the stretcher down and sagged on her knees beside it, utterly\nspent. Her legs were trembling. Her arms were trembling. Her eyelids\nfluttered. She knelt there in the mud, just breathing.\nThe wounded man had stopped his groans, at least. The surgeon’s"

Like an irresistible tide\ncoming in.\n“He’s dead.”\nAriss wiped her forehead on the back of her wrist, realised she’d\nsmeared blood all over her face.\nScalla dragged the corpse off the blood-soaked stretcher. “Let’s get\nanother.”\nAriss wearily nodded. “I suppose.” She lurched up, stumbled as\nsomeone crashed into her. A boy who went sprawling next to the corpses,\ncap falling off to show a shock of blonde curls.\n“Sorry! I’m sorry.” A girl, then, snatching her cap up and, with one last\nlook back, running on.\nHildi limped for a few strides, rubbing at her bruised leg until the pain\nfaded then upping the pace, ducking through an alley where a couple of\nmen were getting wounds dressed by nurses. She upset a basket full of\nbandages as she plunged past but couldn’t stop, whipping some washing out\nof her way and leaving it flapping behind her.\nOut of the town and she ran faster, breath cutting at her chest as she hit\nthe grassy slope up the side of the hill. Kept her eyes on her feet. Kept her\nmind on the few strides in front of her. Orso was relying on her. She\nclenched her fist tighter around the message. Volunteered to carry it, hadn’t\nshe? More or less insisted on carrying it.\nWanting to prove she was useful. Wanting to prove she was brave. She\nwas the one always carried messages for Orso, so she’d carry this one.\nRealised her mistake soon as she ran from the town hall and into the\nmadness in the street. She’d hated carrying Orso’s messages to that bitch\nSavine dan Glokta. Her affected elegance and her gaudy taste and her\nsuperior little smirks. But Hildi’s chances of getting killed carrying love\nletters had been very small.\n“Hildi, you damn fool,” she hissed.\nThe sad fact was, if she was honest with herself… she loved Orso. Not\nloved loved. Not in love. She loved him like an older brother. Like a\nhelpless, hopeless, hesitant older brother who just happened to be King of\nthe Union. He was good to her. No one else ever had been. No one else had\never thought she was worth being good to. He was above everyone, but\nsomehow he treated her, who was lower than dirt, like an equal. It would’ve\nbeen strange if she hadn’t loved him.\nBut she could’ve let someone else carry the bloody message.\nShe paused on the hillside to catch her breath. Paused, and prised her\neyes away from the grass. Made herself turn to stare out across the valley.\n“Oh, fuck,” she breathed.\nFrom here she could see the whole battlefield. The whole grand insanity\nof it. Over beyond the town, the steep bluff was wreathed in smoke, little\nplumes and puffs stabbing out. There were fires in the orchards below it,"

There were fires in the orchards below it,\ndark columns drifting into the heavy sky. Fires in Stoffenbeck, too. The air\nwas sharp with their smoke.\nCurving away from her, the great crescent of the king’s lines.\nGlimmering metal where the fighting was. Flags limp over the press.\nThickets of pikes. Blocks of dark-clothed Anglanders still crawled forward\nacross the open fields. Horsemen moved and wheeled behind.\nThe lines had shifted, even she could see that, bowing back in the centre\nwhere the fighting was hottest, the massed Anglanders grinding ever so\ngradually in toward Stoffenbeck, weight of numbers starting to tell. Time\nwas running out.\nShe turned back to the hill, forced her tired legs on. She ran past a dead\nhorse with two arrows sticking from its side, flies already busy at the blood\nin the grass. Northman’s arrows, long and slender, flights fluttering in the\nwind.\nShe ran past a man snarling, “Damn it!” again and again as he fiddled\nwith the jammed crank of his flatbow, fussing with the bolt, trying to turn\nthe handle, fussing with the bolt, trying to turn the handle, fussing with the\nbolt, over and over. “Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!”\nSomeone clutched at her ankle, nearly dragged her over. “Help…” A\nman on a stretcher, blond hair turned brown with sweat stuck to his clammy\npale face. “Help…” She kicked free and hurried on, half-running, half-\nclawing at the grass with one hand while the other stayed white-knuckle\ntight around Orso’s message.\nShe ran on. Up onto the brow of the hill. Breath wheezing. Legs aching.\nA big corporal got in her way, shoved her back so hard she bit her tongue\nand nearly fell. “Where the hell are you going?”\n“I have to speak to Lord Marshal Forest!” she gasped out. “Message…\nfrom His Majesty.”\n“That’s the king’s girl!” someone shouted. “Let her through!”\nShe gave the corporal almost as hard a shove as he’d given her, then\nnearly tripped over a corpse just behind him. A Northman’s corpse, fur\naround his shoulders matted with blood. He wasn’t alone. Lots of bodies,\nleft where they fell.\nIt was plain things were as much of a mess up here as they were down in\nStoffenbeck. Forest’s own staff had seen action. One officer’s arm was in a\nsling. Another stood with sword drawn, staring at the edge as if he could\nhardly believe there was blood on it. The lord marshal himself stood with\nfists clenched, frowning down towards the valley, an oasis of good-natured\ncalm, snapping out orders, clapping men’s backs. Just seeing him was a\nreassurance. At last, someone in charge. Someone who could help.\nShe stumbled up, holding the message out to him, realised it was\ncrumpled to a smudged mess in her sweaty fist. “The Anglanders… are\npushing us back… towards Stoffenbeck.” She was breathing so hard, she"

Can’t fail!”\nThey’d been mauled when the Northmen first came. Only just pushed\nthem back. Wounded everywhere. Morale in tatters. They needed something\nto believe in. Someone to give ’em courage. Forest had no idea how it had\nhappened, but it looked like that someone would have to be him.\n“The king’s counting on us, boys!”\nYears back, when they first made him a sergeant, he’d imagined the\nofficers must have all the answers. When he was given his commission,\nhe’d imagined the generals must have all the answers. When King Orso\nmade him a general, he’d imagined the Closed Council must have all the\nanswers. Now, as a lord marshal, he finally knew it for an absolute fact. No\none had the answers.\nWorse. There weren’t any.\nThe best you could do was play a long con and act as if you had them.\nNever show fear. Never show doubt. Command was a trick. You had to\nspread the illusion that you knew what you were doing as deep and as wide\nthrough your men as you could. Spread the illusion and hope for the best.\n“Steady, lads!” he roared. ’Course he was scared. Any sane man would\nbe. But you push it down. You make yourself a rock. The king was counting\non him. The king! Counting on him! He couldn’t fail.\n“We need the reserves!” squeaked a panicky major.\n“There are no reserves,” said Forest calmly, even if his stomach was\ntrying to climb out of his mouth and run for the rear. “Everyone’s fighting. I\nsuggest you join ’em.”\nAnd he drew his sword. Felt like the moment to do it. He’d had it forty\nyears. Ever since they made him a sergeant. Never swung it in anger. Never\nhad to. A good soldier needs to march. Needs to keep discipline. Needs to\nstay cheerful. Needs, sometimes, to stand where he is. Actual fighting was\ndown near the bottom of the list somewhere.\nBut rarely, very rarely, it has to be done.\n“The king’s counting on us!” he roared. “We can’t fail!”\nA young lieutenant stumbled past and Forest caught him by the collar\nwith his free hand, near dragged him off his feet.\n“Lord Marshal!” he stared with wide, wet eyes. “I was… I was…”\nRunning for it, obviously. Forest hardly blamed him. But he had to stop\nhim."

Men fixed on his death. Men made of murder. Animals. Savages.\nNo game. No story. They meant to kill him. They meant to rip him open\nand spill his guts down the hillside. They meant to dash his brains out like\nthey’d dashed out Corporal Bland’s brains, and him a very nice man with a\nsister in Holsthorm who’d just had a daughter.\nStillman made no decision.\nJust those bloody legs of his again. He turned to run, tripped over a\nfallen spear and went sprawling on his face.

Then something\nsmashed him in the back and the ground hit him in the face again and\neverything was cold. His mouth was full of blood, and grass, and he\ncoughed and gurgled and squirmed, clutching, clutching.\nDownside snarled as he hacked at the man in the red jacket again, drove a\ngreat dent into the back of his helmet and knocked him limp.

He squealed something\nbefore Downside drove the rim of his shield into his throat, and again.\nA sword scraped off his mailed shoulder. Downside spun about, caught\nthe man who’d swung it in the hip with his axe, bent him sideways, lifted\nhis shield high and smashed the rim down on the back of his helmet, reared\nup and smashed his axe down in the same place so the metal was caved\nright in.\nThe fight was a mess. Lines long gone. Melted into tangles of murder.\nHe stomped on a crawling man. Flying blood and flying dirt and flying\nmetal. Stomped him again. Men killing each other. A Union officer with\nteeth bared was using his sword like a shovel, squatting on a Northman’s\nchest and digging at his caved-in head. Downside roared as he stepped up\nand hacked his back wide open, blood spraying. His shield had got tangled\nwith a dead Northman’s cloak, Downside tried to tear it loose, couldn’t,\ntwisted his arm free of the straps, left it behind.\nSomeone came at him with a spear and Downside sidestepped, caught it\nbelow the blade, tugging on it with one hand, and was dragged around\nwhile the man who held it tried to jerk it free. He swung with his axe and\nhit the man in the shoulder, split him open and he gave a strange hoot,\nmouth a round O of surprise, and suddenly Downside was stumbling around\nholding the spear. Nearly stabbed himself with it. Hacked at someone and\nblood spattered him, eyes full of it, mouth full of it, flung the spear away,\ntrying to wipe his face.\nSomeone barrelled into him and they rolled on the ground. He’d lost his\naxe. Or tangled on the loop around his wrist, knocking at his side.\nDownside came out on top, punched, kneed, snarled at the man while the\nman snarled back, struggling and straining. Downside punched him again,\nand again, smashed his nose to red pulp, got a hand around the haft of his\naxe and started chopping. Chopped a dent in his breastplate, chopped a\ngreat wound out of his face. Hacked at him with his axe, hacked at him,\nhacked at him, snorting and spitting, breath ripping at his chest, muscles on\nfire, blood surging so hard in his skull he thought it’d pop his eyes out.\n“Die!

He fumbled a dagger from his belt\nwith numb fingers and straight away dropped it as a man blundered into\nhim, caught him, wrestled with him, the two of them staggering about,\nslipping on the wet grass, over the wet corpses, the fallen weapons, the\nfallen shields, the bits of men.\nDownside growled and snarled and spat into his beard as he grabbed the\nman’s head and twisted it, wrenched it around, twisted it, and he fumbled at\nDownside’s clawing fingers but couldn’t stop him, made a great shrill\nsqueal, cut off as his neck bones crunched apart.\nSomething smashed into the side of Downside’s face and the world\nreeled. He rolled on the ground, clawed his way up, fell back onto his hands\nand knees. Where was he? Clutched at someone and brought him down,\nclambered on top of him, punching, snapping, punching, started throttling\nhim and his face was all twisted and his eyes bulging as he stared up at\nDownside, trying to push a finger up his nose. Downside twisted his head\naway and gave a broken howl like a mad dog slaughtered and dragged the\nman up and smashed him down, choking him, throttling him, crushing his\nthroat with his hands.\nCrush him till there was nothing left.\nCrush ’em all.\nCold Blood\nT\nhere was a sharp crack and several tons of masonry crashed into the town\nsquare, throwing out chunks of ornamental carving and a cloud of choking\ndust. One of Orso’s guards hurled himself down. Lord Hoff shrank into a\ncorner. One might have expected Corporal Tunny to dive for cover, or,\nindeed, to never have left cover, but instead he was doing his best to shield\nthe Steadfast Standard with his body. Even Gorst flinched. But Orso found\nhimself entirely unmoved.\n“A cannon-stone must have clipped one of those lovely chimneys. A sad\nloss to posterity…” He brushed a few specks of plaster from his shoulder\nplate. Pauldron, was that the word? Or vambrace? He got them mixed up.\n“Your Majesty!” piped Gorst. “You should withdraw!”\n“Nonsense, Colonel, things are just getting interesting.”\nA ridiculous affectation, of course, things had gone beyond horrifying\nsome time ago and did not look like coming back. But why attend a battle at\nall if you’re not going to say at least one heroically imperturbable thing?\nHe held Lord Hoff out of the way to allow a stretcher to pass, hauled by\na heavyset man in a blood-spattered apron and a gasping woman with hair\nsweat-stuck across her face. “Well done!” he called after them. “Well\ndone!”\nContrary to all logic, Orso felt no fear at all. A great deal less than usual,\nin fact. He sometimes could hardly face breakfast, was alarmed by the\nnotion of choosing a shirt, but epic disaster appeared to have finally brought\nout the best in him.\nEven as the Northmen came pouring through the wheat to the east, then"

Even as the army of\nAngland advanced across the fields and engaged the Crown Prince’s\nDivision in a vicious melee, then drove them back. Even as the rebels’\ncannons started firing on Stoffenbeck. Even as the wounded crawled back\nthrough the streets, and the fires sprang up across the town, and the smoke\nbillowed around the clock tower, his mood had continued to lift. As if he\nwas somehow balanced on a set of scales against everybody else, and as\ntheir doubt and terror grew his own spirits soared.\nHe hoped that it looked like immense bravery, but it felt like nothing to\nbe proud of. Immense stupidity, maybe. Immense arrogance. Perhaps that\nwas all courage really was. Being so convinced of one’s own importance\none came to believe death was something only other people need worry\nabout.\n“Your Majesty!” squeaked Hoff, his voice even higher than Gorst’s now.\n“You really must withdraw!”\n“You can, by all means,” said Orso. “I’ll catch you up.”\nHe squatted beside a cowering boy, not an easy operation in full armour.\n“Up you get, now.” The lad’s eyes went from wide with fear to even wider\nwith astonishment as he realised who was helping him to his feet. “You\nhave my permission to head for the rear.” He ruffled the lad’s hair, sending\ndown a shower of broken plaster. “Consider it a royal edict!”\nQuite possibly his last, the way things were going. The thought almost\nbrought up a snort of laughter. The Fates help him, he was enjoying himself.\nWas he mad?\n“At least put your helmet on, Your Majesty,” whined an officer, holding\nout the plumed royal headpiece.\nOrso waved it away. “A king needs to be seen. And to be seen to be\nseen.” A woman was cringing in a doorway with her tangled blonde hair\nfull of dust, gripping a drawing board tightly with one fist while she\ndesperately sketched the carnage before her with the other. “Make sure you\nget my good side!” Orso called to her. “Can’t actually remember which it is,\nmind you…”\nHis father had once told him that a king’s job was generally just to stand\nthere, but it was still a job one could do badly. At that moment, he felt he\nwas doing it rather damn well. He gave his best salute as a column of\nspearmen clattered past, heading, he was pleased to see, towards the\nfighting rather than away.\n“Heroes!” he called to them. “Every one of you!”\nThey looked amazed to see him there but pleased, too. Proud, even.\nThey trotted past the faster, soon lost in the rolling smoke. It appeared the\nrebels were using some new kind of cannon-stone which not only smashed\nbuildings to pieces but set those pieces on fire.

He was astonished to see Tunny flinging himself into the path of\ndanger on the other side, Steadfast Standard in one hand and sword in the\nother. Horsemen were indeed moving through the murk. Orso inflated his\nchest indignantly, exactly the way his mother might have when faced with\nan impudent maid.\n“Friendlies!” squeaked Gorst.\nSeveral officers from one of the Crown Prince’s regiments, in fact, red\njackets so soot-smeared they were hard to tell from dark Angland uniforms.\n“Your Majesty! We’re being driven back in the centre. The Anglanders\nwon’t stop coming!”\n“Very well, Major. Give ground. Withdraw into Stoffenbeck and form\nanother perimeter. Fight them in the streets if you must. Any chance of help\nfrom Lord Marshal Forest?” he asked as the officers clattered off to their\nlikely dooms.\n“He sent a messenger asking for help from us,” said Tunny, sheathing\nhis sword.\n“Damn it.” Orso would never forgive himself if anything happened to\nHildi. “What about Lord Marshal Rucksted? Any sign?”\nGorst grimly shook his head. Perhaps Vick dan Teufel had been right,\nthe Breakers had risen up in Keln and their last hope had never even left.\n“My leg! My leg!” A man was carried past, arms over the shoulders of\ntwo others, his leg most clearly missing below the knee. A cannon-stone\nstruck a roof on the other side of the square and sent an avalanche of broken\nslates raining down, people diving for cover in all directions.\nA soft touch on Orso’s arm, a soft voice in his ear. “Your Majesty.”\nSulfur, leaning close. “You really must withdraw.”\n“Protecting your master’s investment?” asked Orso.\n“It will do no one any good if the king is killed by falling masonry.”\nOrso took a breath and nodded. “Especially not me.” And, he had to\nadmit, things were starting to take on a subtle, but very distinct, flavour of\ndefeat. “We’ll fall back a few hundred strides! No more.”\n“Very good, Your Majesty,” said Tunny, hoisting the Steadfast Standard\nonto his shoulder.\n“One moment.” Orso looked up at it. The white horse of Casamir still\npranced as proudly as ever, and the golden sun of the Union still shone as\nradiantly. More so, if anything, in the midst of all this blood, grime and\nchaos. Leo dan Brock had been so very taken with it when they led that\nparade through Adua together, had looked so admiringly upon it at dinner. A\nman who placed a lot of faith in flags, one way or another. Orso slowly\nbegan to smile. “I think my standard should probably remain.”\n“But, Your Majesty…” A captain cleared his throat, as though to explain\nthe obvious to a dullard. “It must be wherever you are. How else will you be\nfound on the battlefield?”\n“Well, exactly,” said Orso. “We have a few cannon left over, don’t we?”\nThat footman was still following him, his purple livery thoroughly"

Even without\nthem, everything was muffled. One of the cannons had burst, killing half its\ncrew. Three others were cracked and useless. Three more had warped so\nbadly they couldn’t be fired. Another had jumped from its trestles and rolled\ndown the hill, crushing two men before they could get out of the way. The\nrest had run out of stones and powder, their soot-blackened crews sprawled\nspent on the hillside like escapees from hell.\nGurkish Fire had left a stinking black scar through the grass, shrouding\nthe summit in smoke as the rain started to spit down. Below, she could see\nthe troops of the Open Council slogging steadily up the hillside under\ndrooping flags. They were battered by cannon fire, sodden from the river,\nexhausted from the climb. But they were coming, and in numbers.\n“What do we do?” asked Vick.\nPike surveyed the scene with the disappointed air of a cook come home\nto find his kitchen in a terrible mess. “Prepare to pull back.”\nVick looked down towards Stoffenbeck, fires burning in the rubble-\nstrewn streets, wounded trickling towards the rear. “The king will be left\nwith his arse in the breeze.”\n“Would you rather fight?”\nTo her, fighting was a knee in the balls, a thumb in the eye, a punch in\nthe throat. It was a nail hidden in a heel of bread, brass knuckles and fistfuls\nof soil, a sock with a rock in it. It was hurting someone as quickly and as\nbadly as you could with whatever was to hand. None of that was any use in\na battle, against armoured men and ranks of pikes. Against flatbow volleys\nand cannon-stones.\nWhat would she even be fighting for? She hardly knew any more.\nMaybe she never had. Desperately searching for something to be loyal to,\nas Glokta had once told her.\n“Your Eminence!” A Practical was stumbling across the grass, pointing\nwildly behind him. A rider was coming over the brow of the hill.\nHe was a beefy man with a mud-stained uniform and a great wedge of\nbrown beard, and a lot of other riders were appearing behind him. The\nenemy, Vick supposed. Some lord of the Open Council, got around their\nflank and climbed the back of the hill, ready to finish them off.\n“Good timing, Lord Marshal Rucksted!” called Pike. Vick wasn’t\nusually slow on the uptake, but it took her a moment to make sense of\nthings.\n“Glad we didn’t miss the party, Your Eminence.” Rucksted reined in"

He beckoned an aide\nover with one finger. “Arrange a charge and get rid of this rabble, eh?\nThere’s a good fellow.”\nAnd Vick realised that what she’d taken for a phantom of her battered\nhearing was the very real drumming of approaching hooves. A very great\nnumber of hooves. It seemed reinforcements had arrived after all.\nShe stumbled to one of the broken trestles, her stiff hip aching.\nHad to sit on her hands to stop them shaking.\nSavine stared, mouth open in disbelief as, with awful, nerve-shredding\nslowness, all her ambitions came apart at the seams.\nIt felt as if it had taken days for the Open Council’s cannon-mauled\nranks to emerge from the smouldering orchards, then edge in multicoloured\ntatters across the broken ground towards the bluff. Isher’s blue lines had\nbuckled as they reached the hill, wavered, re-formed and gradually begun to\nclimb.\nThe enemy’s cannon had fallen silent, while their own were finally\nmounted on the hill below her and began to pound steadily at Stoffenbeck,\npuffs of dust among the roofs marking the impacts of their stones, columns\nof smoke marking the fires they had set. Orso’s lines bowed backwards in\nthe centre, Stour’s Northmen attacking furiously on the left.\nThe fierce smile had spread across her face. With that bluff in their\nhands, the town could not be held. The centre would give, Stour would\nbreak through on the left, the day would be theirs.\nAnd the throne would be hers.\nThen, as the veils of smoke from the cannon below her shifted, she\nnoticed something. A glint of steel in the saddle between the rocky bluff and\nthe one beside it. A thin rain was falling now, turning the battlefield hazy,\nbut as she stepped forward, squinting through her eyeglass, there could be\nno doubt.\nMore steel, and more. A flood of it, spilling down from the high ground.\nHorsemen. A vast, dully glinting wave of them.\n“No,” she whispered. They tore into the flank of Isher’s ragged units,\ntook them by surprise and broke them like blue dust, surging on towards the\norchards. The red blob of Barezin’s re-formed legion came apart long\nbefore they hit, scattering back towards the river.\n“No,” whispered Savine again. As if the word was a prayer. But how\noften had she boasted to Zuri that she believed in nothing that could not be\ntouched, and counted, and totted up in a ledger? They had been sure Orso\nwould get no reinforcements. They had counted on it. And yet here they\nwere, armed and eager, ripping all her plans to bits.\n“No,” whispered Savine. A moment ago, she had tasted victory. Now\nnothing was certain. She wanted to sink to her knees. She wanted to lie\ndown in the grass. But someone had to do something.\nAn engineer at the nearest cannon was just touching smouldering match-"

But someone had to do something.\nAn engineer at the nearest cannon was just touching smouldering match-\ncord to powder-pan as the rest of the crew hunched away, hands over their\nears. Savine started striding towards them, one hand under her belly. “We\nhave to get—”\nThere was a blinding flash. She was turning her face away, raising one\nhand, starting to gasp, when she was snatched off her feet and flung into the\nground.\nHeroics\n“T\nhe bastards are running!” snarled Antaup.\n“I noticed,” said Leo, watching in helpless fury as the Open Council’s\nforces crumbled and fled for the river.\nA moment ago, they’d been close to flanking the enemy on the right.\nNow they were in danger of being flanked themselves.\n“By the dead,” he growled. The army of Angland had done their part.\nFought for every inch of ground, forced Orso’s men from their positions,\nbent their crescent in the centre until it touched the outskirts of Stoffenbeck.\nThey were still fighting, through the smoke and spitting rain, the melee\nbroken up into a dozen ugly little struggles among the buildings.\n“Shit!” He smashed at his armoured leg with his armoured fist. Another\nhour and the day would’ve been theirs. But they didn’t have another hour.\nThey didn’t have another moment.\n“We could still pull back!” roared Antaup over the noise.\n“To where?” snapped Leo. “To what?” They’d leave Orso with the field,\nwith the initiative, with every chance of reinforcement, while their own\nalliance would fall apart. He’d go from liberator to laughing stock. History\nwould record him as a treacherous loser.\n“You know what?” Jin leaned in with that huge grin of his. “I reckon\nanother tap might shatter the bastards!”\n“The cavalry are fresh!” As if Jin’s smile was catching, Antaup had one,\ntoo. “One more throw of the dice?”\nNow Leo was smiling. How could he help it when his friends were\nlaughing at death? He had to stop himself turning to ask Jurand what he\nthought. He wished him and Glaward were there now. He looked up\ntowards the king’s standard. The Steadfast Standard, flapping free above the\nsmoke and ruin on the high clock tower, the golden sun glinting as the real\nthing slipped through the spitting clouds overhead.\nThere was still time. If he could shatter Orso’s centre… seize that flag…\ntake the king himself prisoner… none of the mistakes would matter. Victory\nsponges all crimes away, Verturio said. Or was it Bialoveld? What did it\nmatter? The day would be won with swords, not words. This was the\nmoment he’d been waiting for. There wouldn’t be a better. There wouldn’t\nbe another. It was a moment for heroes.\nIn battle, his father had always told him, a man finds out who he truly is.\nHe was the Young Lion. And a lion doesn’t slink away with his tail between\nhis legs.

A lion fights to the last.\nHe slid his arm through the straps of his shield. “Tell the cavalry we\ncharge!” he bellowed.\n“Ha!” Antaup wrenched his borrowed horse around and thundered away\nto give the orders.\nLeo could see exhausted men floundering from the river on the near\nbank. Across the water, the King’s Own cavalry surged and whirled like the\nstarlings above the field the day before, harrying the panicked remnants of\nthe Open Council’s forces. Corpses floated downstream, clogged into a\ngreat bobbing tangle in the boggy shallows.\nBut no corpses, no glory. Leo drew his sword with that faint hiss of steel\nthat always sent a tingle across his skin, then turned his horse towards the\ngreat wedge of cavalry that was quickly forming. The men who’d ridden\nbeside him in the North, and never let him down. The best of the best.\nOrdered, disciplined, fearless, their armour beaded with wet as the rain\nthickened.\n“Men of Angland!” he roared, raising his sword high. “Are you with\nme?”\nFew of them could’ve heard the words but they got the gist, shoving\ntheir lances at the spitting heavens, letting go a rousing cheer.\n“For Leo dan Brock!” roared Antaup.\n“For the Young Lion!” bellowed Jin.\nLeo took his place between them at the sharp end of the wedge. Where\nhe’d longed to be ever since Isher first mentioned rebellion. Ever since\nSavine made it a reality. Ever since he was last here. Where he belonged.\nThe very point of the spear.\nHe lifted the rim of his shield and used it to snap down his visor.\n“Forward!” he roared, though it couldn’t have been more than a metallic\nburble outside his helmet, and he gave his horse the spurs.\nFirst at a walk, down the rutted road towards Stoffenbeck, surface turned\nto sticky glue by the drizzle, churned by the hooves of his horse as he urged\nit forward to battle.\nHe looked to his left. Jin never wore a visor. Leo could see his teeth in\nhis red beard, eyes furiously narrowed, heavy mace raised. He looked to his\nright. Antaup, spear couched under his arm, a grin across his handsome face\nthat made Leo grin, too.\nNow at a trot, the buildings ahead growing clearer through the rain and\nthe smoke, bodies scattered where they’d fallen as the fighting ground\ntowards Stoffenbeck, the tangle of weapons and limp banners where the\nbattle was still hot, all jolting with the movement of Leo’s horse.\nNot the first charge he’d led, but the thrill was fresh every time. The dry\nmouth, the aching muscles, the snatched breath. The ground sped past\nbeneath, as if he flew. The delicious vibration, from earth to hooves to\nsaddle and up into his very guts. The fear and the excitement building to a\njoy that made him want to scream. He flourished his sword, raising it high.\nThe ranks of Angland parted before them, officers screaming as they\nforced the men to wheel back, lines opening so the horses could stream\nthrough."

A battle ill-suited to horsemen, though, it\nhad to be admitted. Leo never seemed to learn where that was concerned.\nThere were strong barricades across the narrower alleys: tree trunks with\nstakes hammered through them, heaped-up doors and rubble, bristling with\npikes. But across the widest street, dead ahead, the barricades were weak,\nno more than scattered furniture and a few spears.\nLeo pointed his sword towards them, tried to roar a command which\nbecame nothing more than echoing breath behind his visor.\nEverything was pounding hooves, flying mud and billowing smoke,\nrushing noise and rushing wind, thudding along with his own thumping\nheartbeat, rattling teeth, booming breath, all seen through a slot you could\nhardly get a letter through.\nThe enemy melted before them, scattering, scurrying between the\nbuildings. Leo whooped, cut a man down as he turned to run, sword\nclattering from his backplate and knocking him under the milling hooves.\nThey were through! Through into the square at the heart of Stoffenbeck.\nThey’d cut the king’s lines in half! A building burned on one side, smoke\ndrawing a veil across the scattered rubbish, broken masonry, twisted\ncorpses, a ruined fountain leaning at an angle, spilling water. He saw the\ntown hall with its tall clock tower, one of its faces shattered, bent hands\nfrozen at the moment its guts were torn out by a stray cannon-stone.\n“Forward!” roared Leo, waving his men furiously on, but at the same\ntime he was having to rein back. There was nothing to charge at. He caught\na glimpse of the Steadfast Standard at the top of the clock tower. But no\nsign of the King’s Own, let alone the Knights of the Body. The whole place\nwas oddly deserted. Riders spread out around him, all momentum lost,\nmilling, rearing, clattering into one another like sheep in a pen.\nHe heard a shout from across the square. “Ready!”\nA breeze whipped up, brought a sudden shower into the faces of the\nriders, tugging the curtain of smoke aside. Long enough for Leo to see\nbarricades across the roads that led out. No weak ones, these. Bristling with\nsharpened stakes, spears firmly set in a glittering tangle. The spears of men\nready and waiting.\nAnd dull metal rings, with darkness inside. The maws of cannon, Leo\nrealised, pointed right at them.\nHe tried to turn his horse, ripping up his visor so he could warn his men,\nbut it was far too late.\n“Fire!”\nBroad heard the crash of the volley. So loud it made his teeth buzz.\nHe froze, crouching in a trampled flower bed by the wreckage of a\nfence. Any man with half his sense would’ve run the other way.

There was no resisting its pull any more than a\nfloating cork resists a wave.\nMess came at him blurred from the murk, sharpened under his feet,\ndrifted into the smears behind him. Broken weapons, broken armour,\nbroken bodies. Even the earth was wounded. Muddy ground so ripped and\nscarred it looked fresh-ploughed. Injured men clawed through their clothes\nto see how bad their wounds were. Clawed at the ground. Clawed for the\nrear. One was so coated in filth that even close up Broad couldn’t tell which\nside he was on. Without his lenses there were hardly sides at all.\nThe cavalry had thundered through and torn the lines apart. Ripped them\ninto shreds of bitter fighting, tattered struggles to the death, writhing in the\nsmoke. Broad saw the blobbed shapes of three men shaken loose. King’s\nmen, he thought. Deserters, maybe. That was his best guess. In a battle, a\nguess is all you can afford. Time to let go, finally, and he felt the smile twist\nhis face.\nThe first never saw him coming. Got his helmet staved in from the side\nwith the warhammer.\nThe second turned to look. A flash of his scared eyes in his blurred face\nbefore Broad’s dagger thudded into the side of his neck.\nThe third turned to run, got one step when Broad hooked his legs out\nfrom under him with the pick-end and brought him down. He rolled over,\ntrembling arms held up. Before he got a word out, Broad smashed him three\ntimes with the hammer, broke his arm, caved his ribs in, caught him in the\nside of his face and sent teeth flying, jaw half-ripped from his head.\nHe squirmed in the dirt, back arched, and Broad stepped over him,\nlooking for more, snorting breath steam-hot, teeth locked vice-tight,\nmuscles coiled-spring tense.\nShapes rushed from the gloom and he raised his hammer. Horses,\nclattering past. Riderless, maddened, reins flapping, eyes rolling. One with\nblood streaking its flanks, another with a loose boot still caught bouncing in\na stirrup.\nA weak barricade across the street. Left weak on purpose. An invitation.\nOne Brock hadn’t been able to refuse. Broad was no better. He slunk\nthrough, keeping low, lips curled back, the low growl sawing at his throat.\nA soldier knelt, pointing a broken spear.\n“Get back!” he shouted.\nBroad took one step and smashed his head open with the hammer. He’d\nseen men keep fighting with wounds in the body you wouldn’t believe.\nMake the skull a very different shape, that’s the best way to be sure. Flatten\nit, shatter it, punch holes right through it.\nA window cracked, flames licking up the outside of a building. Broad\ncoughed on smoke, prickled with sweat. Eyebrows slick with it. Blurred\nshapes loomed up. Pillars. What had been a covered market, its roof ripped\naway, slates and scorched timbers and chunks of masonry scattered."

Broad could hardly move without\nstepping on ’em. Dead men and dead horses, tangled and torn apart. Even\nthe stonework was scarred and pockmarked. Cannons’ work, he reckoned.\nCannons filled with smiths’ oddments. A storm of hot metal no armour, no\nshield and for damn sure no courage could stop. The place stank of smoke\nand blood, of broken men and smashed-open horses and everything they\nhold.\nMad fighting here. He saw a man laying about him from horseback.\nAnother dragged from his saddle, hacked on the ground. Two men wrestled\nover a knife. Black figures against the fires. Devils in hell.\nBroad charged into the very midst of it, caught a man full in the side\nwith his shoulder and dumped him sprawling, sword bouncing from his\nhand. He reeled into someone else, spear clattering against Broad’s back as\nhe swung, too close for the hammer and Broad stabbed with his knife,\noverhand. It scraped on a breastplate, scratched down an armplate, found\nthe joint between the two and punched deep into flesh. The man tried to\ntwist away, fumbling at Broad’s shoulder, and Broad rammed the dagger\nthrough the slot in his helmet, left it stuck there to the hilt as he toppled\nback.\nThe first man was scrambling for his fallen sword and Broad caught his\nclutching hand with a swing of the hammer. Turned it to a shapeless red\nglove. The man took a breath to scream, bent over and Broad kicked him so\nhard under the jaw his helmet flew right off and went skittering across the\ngouged cobbles. Kicked him again, and again. Couldn’t stop kicking him.\nThere was a cracking sound above. A great mass of stone fell crumbling,\nburst apart in a gout of fire. One man was flattened, others threw themselves\ndown, reeled burning, trying to slap the flaming embers free. Broad hit\nanother with the hammer so hard, he turned him over in the air and sent his\ncorpse bouncing from a wall upside down.\nHe caught a flicker of movement, lurched back as a blade hissed past his\nnose. Lurched back again as the sword came at him the other way, caught it\nclumsily on the steel haft of his hammer.\nThey blundered into each other, wrestling, hints of a bearded face, teeth\nlocked in a snarl. He butted at Broad, made him bite his tongue and filled\nhis mouth with blood, but Broad had the wrist of his sword arm, set his\nweight and drove the bearded bastard back against a wall, and again,\nmashed his hand against the broken stonework till his sword clattered\ndown.\nHe freed his hammer, snarled as he swung it at the man’s face, but he\nslid free, the head catching the wall, twisting the haft from Broad’s buzzing\ngrip.

They crashed over, rolling through burning\nwreckage.\nBroad came out on top, all four of their fists clamped tight around the\ngrip of the knife, the fire-gleaming blade quivering as they strained at it.\nBroad twisted it, straining, straining, clenched his jaw and put all his weight\non it. The man tried to knee him, snorted as he tried to roll him, but Broad\nwas too strong. He took a hand from the knife to claw at Broad’s face,\nturned his head to snap desperately at Broad’s hand with his teeth but it was\ntoo late.\nBroad growled as he forced the blade’s point up under the man’s ear.\nForced it up, blood turning his fist sticky, and he wrenched one hand free to\npeel the man’s clutching fingers away from his face, then made a clumsy\nfist and beat at the pommel like a hammer on a nail, hammered the blade\ninto this bastard’s head till the crosspiece met his jaw.\nBroad staggered up, spitting, gasping for breath. Battle was done here\nfor now, but it’d be back, like waves up a beach. Waves of blood that left\nbodies as flotsam. He could hear it coming. Screams and clashes. Mad\nhonking, squealing, like pigs rutting.\nHe saw a tattered standard sticking up above a heap of dead. As he got\nclose, he could make out the lion, the hammers of Angland. One of Brock’s\nmen still held it, with one arm. Sitting propped against a dead horse. The\nhandsome one. Antaup? He was breathing hard, a couple of little holes\nthrough his breastplate, blood leaking out to soak his trousers.\nLast stand wasn’t a phrase you ever wanted to use about your own side,\nbut that was the look of it. Wounded men. Twisted faces. Desperate\nshouting. Someone coughed, leaning on a broken spear, coughing blood,\nand drooling blood, coughing again. The Northman, Jin, had a flatbow bolt\nin his thigh. He had Brock under the armpits even so, swearing in Northern\nas he struggled to drag him out from under his dead mount.\n“Here,” slobbered Broad. His mouth wouldn’t fit round the human word.\nAll it wanted to do was snarl and bite like an animal. He hooked his arms\nunder the horse’s side and with a growl managed to heave its dead weight\nup enough for Jin to haul the Young Lion free and sag back, spent.\n“Master Broad,” croaked Brock. He looked baffled. Like all this had\ncome as quite the shock.\n“Your wife sent me.” Broad frowned into the murk. Everything beyond\narm’s reach was blurred. Everything more than a few paces off was just\nwriggling smears. Crackle of flames to one side. Air full of smoke and\nsettling dust and dying men’s groans. Brock’s leg was a mangled mess,\narmour crushed and slathered with his blood, his horse’s blood, the knee-\nplate twisted almost flat.\n“Good of you… to come.” Brock lifted his left arm, baring pink teeth as\nhe dragged the battered remnant of his shield from it. “But you can see…”"

He could see that very clearly. He looked up at Jin,\nand the Northman looked back, and no words were any use.\n“Go back… to Savine.” Brock was panting between each phrase. “Make\nsure she gets away.” Like every word was a hero’s effort. “Make sure my\nchild… gets away.”\nBroad stood. There were shapes in the smoke. The king’s men, he\nguessed, moving in to finish it.\nHe took a fallen sword and pressed the hilt into Leo dan Brock’s hand.\nThe Young Lion nodded to him, and Broad nodded back.\nHe could do no good here. But then he hadn’t come to do good. He\nturned away from the killing. Slipped down a ruined side street, and away.\n“Shit,” growled Clover, lowering his eyeglass and frowning down towards\nthe smouldering wreck that used to be a town.\n“What is it?” asked Flick, over the endless racket of the fighting.\n“Best I can tell, the Young Lion’s glorious charge came to grief. Let that\nbe a lesson for you in the value of glorious charges.”\n“What does that mean?”\n“That there’s naught left to fight for. We need to save what we can while\nthere’s still something to save. Stay close and stay low.” And Clover tucked\nthe eyeglass away and drew his sword. Not so much from any desire to\nswing it, but because having it drawn was the done thing in a battle. Then\nhe clenched his jaw, squared his shoulders and headed exactly the wrong\nway. Which was to say towards the fighting.\nIt was bad now. It was always bad, but it was real bad now. Everyone on\nthe arrow-prickled, blood-smeared, mud-churned way was hurt. A Carl\nspluttered blood and bits of teeth into his hands. Another stared stupidly,\nhair clotted with blood. A Thrall clutched at the leaking stumps of two\nfingers, snarling curses. A Named Man sat, pale as milk, staring down at his\nhands as he tried to poke his guts back in through a great slit in his side.\nClover caught his eye and gave him a nod. He was back to the mud, and\nthey both knew it. A nod was all Clover could do for him.\n“By the dead,” croaked Flick, wincing as if he was walking into a wind,\nthe terrible, mindless din of it getting louder and louder.\nClover shook his head. Gripped tight to his sword. Could there have\nbeen a time he enjoyed this? Looked forward to it? Strained every muscle to\nget back to it as soon as he could?\n“Must’ve been mad,” he whispered.\nSome arrows fell fluttering and Clover dropped down, hunching his\nshoulders.

In all this, there was just as much chance of killing your\nside as theirs. Maybe it got so you didn’t care any more. So any killing\nseemed a sensible notion. Everyone else was at it, why be the one fool left\nout?\nBeen a long time since Clover felt that way. The mud’s cold embrace\nwaits for everyone. Getting some poor bastard there faster just ’cause he\nwas facing the other way hardly struck him as a thing worth risking your\nown life for. When there’s a flood, do you waste time raging at the water?\nBy the dead, no, you just try not to drown. Battle’s no different. A natural\ndisaster.\n“Fuck,” someone was snarling, down on one knee, staring at the arrow\nshaft sticking from his shoulder. “Fuck!” Like he never saw a thing so\nunbelievable, so unfair. Should’ve thought about it. Nothing more natural in\na battle than getting shot with an arrow.\nLeast Clover had managed to keep Sholla out of it this time. Told her\nsomeone needed to bring a boat upriver, in case things turned ugly. Hadn’t\nneeded much persuading, in the end. She’d a good head on her, that girl.\nHe’d have liked to leave Flick out, too, but there was one valuable lesson\nfor a boy to learn here. Namely that swords do no good for the men at either\nend of ’em.\n“Chief,” said Flick, tugging on his sleeve.\nDownside knelt there on the hill, corpses all about him, leaning on a\ngreat axe he must’ve prised from some dead man’s fingers, as if he was\nabout to push himself up but couldn’t find the strength.\nHe’d taken the approach to battle Clover might’ve when his name was\nstill Steepfield, which was to say running for wherever the fight was\nwildest, raging and flailing and spilling every drop of blood he could\nwithout a thought for shield or helm or consequences. He was so red-\nspattered, he might as well have gone swimming in a sea of corpses, doing\nhis best imitation of the Bloody-Nine, the mad fucker.\nStill, no man can rage for ever, and he was drooping now, bloody hair\nhanging, mail torn and the cloth beneath ripped, jaw dangling and knuckles\nraw, two of the fingers on his free hand snapped crooked in opposite\ndirections\n“Had your fill, have you?” asked Clover.\nDownside’s eyes rolled slowly up, as if even that was too much effort,\none turned bright red by a blow to the face and his cheek cut and his\nforehead scuffed raw and his brow opened up and weeping a dark streak.\n“Aye,” he croaked out, voice raw from screaming curses. “And more.”\n“The Anglanders are finished. Reckon the day’s done.”\n“Aye,” croaked Downside, blowing a bloody bubble from his nose, and\nhe held that broken hand out to Flick so the lad could help him up. “The\nday’s done.”\n“Where’s Stour?”\nDownside waved a lazy hand towards the crest of the hill.\nClover saw the King of the Northman’s black wolf standard bobbing"

Stour had flung himself\ninto the midst, o’ course. Up front where tomorrow’s songs were made,\ncarving himself a legend. The Great Wolf was brave, no doubt. But bravery\nand folly never had too big a gulf between ’em.\nClover bent down to one of the corpses, some Union man huddled on his\nside like a child on a cold night. He took a quick peek about but everyone\nwas bent to their own tragedies, so he stuck his hand in the man’s ripped-\nopen jacket and flicked blood on his face, smeared it down his mail, rubbed\nhis sword along the corpse’s side to get a bit of red on it.\nHe realised the man was looking at him. Cheek twitched a little. Not\ndead, then. Clover gave him a sad little smile, a sad little shrug.\n“Thanks for the gore.” Then he stood and hurried towards the madness.\nPiece of luck, he didn’t have to go far. He found Stour sat on a rock\nlooking mightily disgruntled. A woman was trying to bind his bleeding leg,\nbut he kept jumping up to shout orders, or at any rate insults, jerking the\nbandages out of her hands.\n“Clover!” he snarled, blood on his teeth. “Where the fuck have you\nbeen?”\n“Trying to keep Downside from killing himself.” True enough, in its\nway. “The Young Lion’s all done. We have to pull back before they get\naround us.”\n“You fucking what?”\nStour cast about him at his various young bastards, but none looked like\nthey fancied another helping of what the Union had served ’em. They’d\nbeen a great deal more warlike leading up than in the thick, it had to be\nsaid. Greenway was gripping Stour’s standard like a man who can’t swim\nclinging to the rail of a sinking ship, flinching wild-eyed at every noise. A\ntough job, as the noise was constant.\n“There’s nothing more to prove up here, my king,” Clover shouted over\nthe racket. “Time to bend with the breeze. Save what we can.”\nSaving things wasn’t on the menu far as Stour was concerned. He was a\nman liked to smash things at any cost. “The Great Wolf doesn’t run,” he\nspat, then gave a pained grunt as the woman pulled the bandage tight.\n“’Course not,” said Clover. “But he might back off when it suits him,\nspecially from another man’s fight. Wouldn’t be our victory. Won’t be our\ndefeat.” He leaned close. “The Young Lion dug this fucking hole. He can be\nthe one buried in it.”\n“The ships are back at the coast,” muttered Greenway, eyes wide.\n“Told my girl Sholla to bring ours up the river. Should be no more than\nten miles off. I got horses waiting. Enough to whisk a few of us safe back\nhome.”\nStour narrowed his eyes. “Always thinking, eh, Clover?”"

There’ll always be more o’ that for the taking. Uffrith? Without\nBrock to defend it, we can snatch it the old-fashioned way!”\nStour worked his red mouth a moment, frowning up towards the summit\nof the hill. Then he bared his teeth, and spat red, and turned away. “We\nfucking pull back.”\n“They’re coming,” gasped Leo. Every breath was a moan through teeth\ngritted against the pain.\nGhosts in the smoke. Shadows in the dust. Among the corpses of man\nand horse, the heaps of rubble and broken spears.\n“You have to go,” he hissed at Jin.\nWhitewater tried to grin. There was a great wound on his head, a bit of\nhis scalp flapping loose. “We’ve come this far together. Reckon I’ll finish\nthe journey with you.” He growled as he snapped off the flatbow bolt buried\nin his leg. “And I’ll be running nowhere anyway.”\nHe dragged himself to one knee, facing the oncoming figures, holding\nhis broken shield up, mace ready in his fist.\nThere was nothing Leo could do. He couldn’t even stand. He twisted\naround, dragging himself with his one good arm, ruined leg scraping after\nhim, fist still clinging to his sword. That commemorative sword with the\nlion’s head pommel. The one King Jezal had presented to him. The proudest\nday of his life.\n“Antaup!” he croaked.\nThe standard was upright, somehow, in the crook of his limp arm. But\nAntaup sat staring at nothing, blood streaked from the holes in his\nbreastplate, that loose lock of hair still stuck to his pale forehead.\nLeo dragged himself up to sit beside him, breathing hard, blowing\nbloody spit. “Sorry,” he muttered. “I’m sorry.”\n“Come on, you bastards!” roared Jin in Northern.\nLeo heard the rattle of flatbows and Jin tottered back, lurched down on\none knee.\n“No,” hissed Leo, forcing the one leg that worked underneath him,\nhooking his elbow around the saddle horn of a dead horse and hauling\nhimself to a wobbling crouch.\nJin toppled over, three bolts sticking from his body.\nHeavy boots crunched across the square. A big man in full armour,\ngolden sun of the Union on his breastplate, heavy battle steels in his hands.\nHe pushed his visor up with the back of one gauntlet. Bremer dan Gorst,\ngreat jaw clenched tight.\nJin lifted an arm to paw weakly at his ankle. Gorst frowned and kicked it\naway.\nLeo used his sword like a crutch, weight all on his good leg, which an\nhour ago had been his bad leg. It hardly seemed to hurt at all now.

He\nscreamed as he lurched forward, lifting his sword for a clumsy thrust.\nGorst took a step back out of reach, Leo’s ruined leg crumpled and he\ncrashed down on his side in the blood-spattered, cannon-scarred, rubbish-\nstrewn square.\nHe whimpered as he wedged his good arm under him, stretched his hand\nout for the hilt of his fallen sword.\nHis fingers crawled across the flags, clutching for the lion-head pommel,\nhalf its gilding scraped away.\nGorst stepped forward and flicked it aside with his armoured boot.\nIt was over.\nJust Talk\n“A\nnother step and you’ll be arrow-pricked, all four o’ you!”\nRikke stopped where she was and showed both her open hands and all\nher teeth.\nHer father used to tell her your best shield is a smile. She’d been\nsceptical then. Looking up at the black battlements, with here or there a\nglimpse of a bow or arrow, she was sceptical now.\nNo one else was smiling. Shivers was a man who subscribed to the\nnotion that your best shield is a shield. The Nail was a man who scorned the\nwhole notion of shields, and if offered one would no doubt have gone for an\nextra axe instead. Corleth, meanwhile, was still working at her angry-little-\ndog act, fists clenched tight around the staff of the banner with the Long\nEye stitched into it.\nStill, good teeth were one of Rikke’s few natural blessings that hadn’t\nbeen covered with tattoos or blinded with a needle, so she made the best use\nof ’em and smiled up wide enough to compensate for all the funereal faces.\n“Wouldn’t want to be arrow-pricked!” she called. “I mean, who does?\nYou know who I am?”\nA pause, and then, very sour, “Rikke.

As luck would have\nit, the sun slipped out right then and lent the whole heap a pretty glitter.\n“I’ve got… quite a lot of silver. Two thousand pieces, maybe?” She rooted\nthrough it with that merry clinking that somehow only money makes.\n“There’s some Carleon coins here, and some Union, and some Styrian\nscales, and… what’s this?” She held a big coin up to the light. Had a head\non both sides.\n“Gurkish,” grunted Shivers. “Emperor on one side, Prophet on t’other.”\n“A Gurkish coin, how about that? All the way from the sunny South!”\nShe stood, brushing her knees off. “Anyway, this is for whoever opens the\ngates. How you split it is up to you. If Master Silent wants to open ’em, he\ncan share it out, I guess.” She left a meaningful pause. “Or the rest of you\ncould. Have yourselves a wrestling match over the Gurkish one. Your\nbusiness. Long as someone lets us in.”\n“You ain’t buying your way in here!” shouted Silent from up on the\nwall, but he sounded a little shrill over the possibility.\n“Well,” she said, all innocence. “You’ve got another choice…”\nThe Nail did that trick of curling his lip and whistling with just his teeth,\nso loud it was almost painful, and armed men showed themselves between\nevery building, at every door and window around the walls. Battle-\nhardened, well-armed men of Uffrith and the West Valleys. Dozens of ’em,\nand adding not one smile to the tally.\n“Which is I give these bastards the money to come over the walls and\ndraw the bolts from that side.” Rikke pressed a hand to her chest. “Now,\nI’ve naught but pride for how peaceful we’ve been so far, and when it\ncomes to bloodshed I’d rather have a trickle than a flood.

Those three she and\nIsern ran into in the woods the day Uffrith burned. Was it really only a year\nor two back? The cold shock as she let go the bowstring. The hurt look in\nthat boy’s eyes. Still gave her a shiver. Then she thought of all the death\nshe’d seen since. The murders and the battles and the duels. The last\nexpressions, the last words, the last breaths, all blurred into one. The blood\nrolled off her now, like milk off a greased pan. Isern always said you have\nto make of your heart a stone.\nShe took a breath, and kicked the casket closed.\nRikke’s father had been less than complimentary on the subject of\nSkarling’s Hall. A cold, hard, rock-carved room for cold, hard, rock-carved\nmen. The place Bethod had seized the North. The place Black Dow\nbetrayed the Bloody-Nine. The place Black Calder had ordered a hundred\nkillings and thievings and petty backstabbings.\nBut Rikke was a firm believer that dark pasts don’t have to mean dark\nfutures, and she was pleasantly surprised by the mood in there. She felt\nhonesty in the light streaming through the high windows. She saw strength\nin its bare stone walls. She heard truth in the sound of the rushing river far\nbelow. The cold, though, she could not deny. Summer was well and truly\ngone.\n“Someone get a fire lit, eh?” she called out as the Named Men tramped\ninto the hall. “Before I shiver my tits off.”\n“Such as they are,” said Isern, frowning down. “A clean floor is a thing\nthe moon despises. A clean floor bespeaks a small mind.”\n“Better’n a dirty one, isn’t it? Bespeaks an orderly mind, I reckon.”\n“Same thing.” Isern curled her lip back, spat a long chagga stain across\nthe stones and gave a nod of satisfaction, like she’d made a small\nimprovement to the world. “You never know, that might be the spot where\nmy daddy near killed the Bloody-Nine for killing my brother.”\nShivers gave a snort. “Ain’t far from the spot where I near killed the\nBloody-Nine for killing my brother.”\n“Maybe you should’ve done it,” said Isern.\n“Maybe’s a game with no winners.” Shivers turned that ring on his little"

The Nail had\nstalked up to the iron cage hanging in the back corner and now his knuckles\nwere white at the bars like he’d rip it apart with his big bare hands.\n“Doubt you’ll pull it down without some tongs or something,” said\nRikke, strolling up.\n“I’ll pull it down one way or another,” he snarled as he wrenched it\nabout, chains jingling.\n“I say leave it up.”\nThe Nail turned on her, holding one fist up under her nose, close enough\nshe had to look at it a little cross-eyed. “My father died in this fucking\ncage!”\n“Aye.” She soaked his rage up with a smile, like a bundle of fresh-shorn\nfleece might soak up punches. “And we might need it to hold the folk who\nkilled him.” And she put her forefinger on that great scarred mass of fist and\ngently pushed it down.\nThe Nail blinked, like he was puzzling that through. Then he started to\nsmile. “I could get to like you.”\n“I’m likeable. Known for it. Likeable Rikke, they call me.”\n“Who’s they?”\n“Just, you know, they.”\n“Would My Lady of the Long Eye care to bring her vision to pass?”\nIsern flicked dust from the seat of Skarling’s chair, standing on its dais in\nthe light of the great windows, polished by the arses of the great men of\nyesteryear.\n“Guess someone’s got to sit in it,” said Rikke. “And I did come all this\nway, and in mixed weather, too.” And she spun about and dumped herself\ndown. She shifted one way. She shifted the other.\n“Well?” asked Shivers.\n“Bit hard on the arse.”\n“Was there a cushion in your vision?” asked Isern. “You might think of\nfinding one if you plan to perch there long.”\nThe Nail stretched his chin a long way forward to scratch at his throat.\n“Do you plan to perch there long?”\nRikke looked up at Shivers. He raised his brow. She looked up at Isern.\nShe raised hers. “Well,” she said, and noisily spat again, “I daresay none o’\nCrummock-i-Phail’s children would disagree with my considered opinion\nthat…” She left an unnaturally long pause before finishing. “We could do\nworse.”\n“My thanks for that ringing endorsement,” said Rikke.\n“They’ll be back, you know,” said the Nail. “Stour and all his warriors.”\nAnd he jerked his thumb towards the door as if he expected ’em to troop in\nany moment.\n“Some will be,” said Rikke. “But if King Orso took any notice of the\nletter I sent him, they’ll have a much harder fight than they were expecting.\nSo Stour’ll come back with a lot fewer warriors than you were expecting.

If\nhe comes back at all.”\nThe Nail stared at her, mouth slightly open.\n“Spent a year in Ostenhorm,” she explained, “with what they call a\ngoverness.”\n“What’s that? Some kind o’ witch?”\n“A particularly boring kind o’ one. But to be fair, it turns out learning to\nwrite has its uses.”\n“So…” The Nail narrowed his eyes, counting off the points on his\nfingers. “You promised the Young Lion you were going with him, then not\nonly did you not go, you stole his ally’s land while he was gone, and\nwarned his enemies he was coming.”\nRikke stretched her chin a long way forward to scratch at her throat, the\nway he’d done a moment ago. “Sounds somewhat underhand put that way.\nBut once you’ve stabbed a man in the back, you’re best off stabbing him a\nfew more times, don’t you reckon? Make sure of the job.”\n“There’s my girl,” grunted Shivers.\n“She was listening after all,” said Isern, stretching up on her tiptoes.\nThe Nail gave a disbelieving little titter, staring at her with something\nclose to admiration. “I could really get to like you,” he said, and he\nwhipped the black fur he wore off his shoulders. “You said something about\na cushion?”\n“What fine manners,” said Rikke, sitting up long enough for him to slip\nit behind her then wriggling back into it.\n“Best not get carried away with yourself,” said Shivers, nudging at the\ndrooping lid of his metal eye with a knuckle. “Black Calder’s still out\nthere.”\nIsern nodded. “He spent a lot of effort winkling his son onto that chair,\nd’you see? Won’t be overjoyed to hear you’ve wedged your skinny arse into\nhis place.”\n“He’ll be ready, the moment you trip up.”\n“And he’s got friends all over,” said the Nail, “and debts owed, and\nfavours to call on. King Orso won’t be ridding us of him, no matter what\nletters you write.”\n“No,” said Rikke. “Black Calder we’ll have to deal with ourselves. And\nunlike his son, he’s a man who earned his name.”\n“Earned it with cleverness and treachery and ruthlessness,” said Isern.\n“All qualities much loved by the moon.”\nShivers had his eye on Skarling’s Chair. “Trouble with being a strong\nman or a clever man with a big, bad name,” he said, and he ought to know,\nafter all, “is that folk always have their best fight ready for you.”\nThe Nail nodded along in sympathy. “There are times I wish folk had\nnever heard o’ me. Look small, look foolish, got no name, well… that’s\nwhen you’re given chances.”\n“Mmmm.” Rikke tapped at the arm of Skarling’s Chair with her\nfingernail.

That Skarling Hoodless himself picked at,\nfor all she knew. “No strength like looking weak, eh?”\n“What you thinking?” asked Shivers.\n“What my father would’ve said, once he got over the shock of seeing me\nhere.” And Rikke looked up. “Sitting in it’s nothing special. It’s staying in it\nthat’s the trick.”\nThe New Harvest\nI\nt was a surprise, in a way, to hear that birds still sang.\nTo see the sun still rose and the wind still blew. But things go on. Orso\ntook a long breath that had a faint, sickening tang of battle about it. “Things\nalways go on,” he murmured.\nNot for everyone, mind you. The dead were everywhere. Sparsely\ndotted, away to the north, then more liberally sprinkled where the fighting\nhad been fiercest, clogged up in knots. Heaps, almost. Perhaps men had felt\nthe need to crawl towards other men while they still had the breath. Perhaps\neven the dead love company.\nThe corpse-gatherers had been labouring from before first light. Whole\ncompanies of them, dragging cadavers by hand, by stretcher and by cart\ninto orderly piles at the corners of fields. There prisoners made unwilling\ngravediggers chopped away with pick and shovel in an effort to make holes\nbig enough to hold them all. Flies, crows and human scavengers had\nmeanwhile appeared from nowhere, flitting busily among the bumper crop\nof bodies while there were still pickings to be had.\nThe disposal of men made an industry, on the impersonal scale of the\nnew age.\n“All that work,” said Orso. “All that effort. All that ingenuity, and\ncourage, and struggle, to make what? Corpses.”\n“Few things indeed,” mused Pike, “seem to have so much appeal before,\nand so little after, as a battle.”\nThe fires in Stoffenbeck were out but smoke still crept from the embers\nto smudge the chalky sky. The picturesque town square was a ruin, several\nof its fine old houses blackened shells, its covered marketplace ripped open\nto the sky, the clock tower mangled beyond repair by cannon-stones. No\nbunting now in honour of Orso’s visit.\nRucksted frowned towards the rocky bluff, where yesterday’s cannons\nstill poked from the hill like the prongs of an iron crown. “The world’s\nchanging, that’s for damn sure. Now a man can put a spark to some powder\nand a thousand strides away another man’s blown limb from limb. There\nwas a time you had to look in his eyes, at least.”\n“That was better?” asked Vick.\n“Victories always come with a cost,” said Sulfur, calmly. “When my\nmaster returns from his business in the West, I do not doubt he will be\nsatisfied with the outcome.”\n“Marvellous,” murmured Orso. “I have engineered a quantity of death to\nsatisfy even the First of the Magi.” His eyes could hardly comprehend the\ncarnage. He kept looking to one side, then scanning across, in an effort to\ntake it all in. “How many people do you think died here?”"

He kept looking to one side, then scanning across, in an effort to\ntake it all in. “How many people do you think died here?”\n“Hundreds,” murmured Hoff, eyes wide.\n“Perhaps thousands,” said Pike, listlessly. “But mostly on the rebel\nside.”\nOrso took scant comfort from that. Most on the rebel side had been\ncitizens of the Union, too. His subjects. They had fought bravely, loyally,\nfor good reasons. But being right is of little value in war. A great deal less\nthan being lucky, certainly. If the cavalry had not arrived when they did, it\nmight have been Leo dan Brock shaking his head over the carnage. Except\nOrso doubted the Young Lion had the imagination for it.\n“Can it really have been worth it?” he found he had said.\n“Can what, Your Majesty?” asked Pike.\n“Anything.” Orso waved a limp hand at the spectacle. “Can anything be\nworth this?”\n“They gave us no choice,” grumbled Rucksted. “You were hardly the\naggressor, Your Majesty.”\n“I played my part,” muttered Orso, gloomily. “If they wanted the crown\nso bloody badly, I could just have given it away. It’s not as if I enjoy\nwearing the damn thing…” He glanced across the unhappy faces of his\nretainers. Probably not the victory speech they had been hoping for. Sulfur,\nin particular, was frowning thoughtfully. “But I suppose your master takes a\ndim view of unauthorised abdications.”\nThe magus bowed his head. “Were he to lose Your Majesty, I can only\nimagine his regret.”\nThey would have to imagine it, since Orso rather doubted Bayaz was\ncapable of displaying any.\n“There are many practical considerations,” said Hoff, hurrying to change\nthe subject. “Large numbers of prisoners to consider.”\n“Many from the Open Council’s forces.” Rucksted gave a disdainful\nsniff. “I hesitate to call them soldiers. Anglanders, too.”\n“When it comes to the rank and file, I tend towards mercy,” said Orso.\n“We have enough Union men to bury.”\nPike inclined his head. “Fines, parole and forced labour may be of more\nvalue than mass executions.”\n“Provided mercy does not extend to the ringleaders,” said Sulfur.\n“Justice must fall on the guilty like lightning. As it did at Valbeck.”\nOrso gave a grimace at that memory, but he did not disagree. “What\nabout the Northmen?”\n“Pulling back towards their ships in disarray,” said Rucksted. “Harried\nby our cavalry.”\n“Let them go. I don’t want to waste one more Union life on the\nbastards.” In truth, Orso had no appetite for any further waste of life at all:\nUnion, Northman, dog or flea.\n“We’ll see every one of those swine herded from our land or buried in\nit.”\n“Stour Nightfall himself is unaccounted for,” said Pike. “I fear we may\nnot have heard his name for the last time.”\n“We can put down the Great Wolf another day.” Orso paused a moment,\nfrowning. “There was no trouble from the Breakers in Keln?”"

If there are Breakers\ndown there, they were quiet as mice while my men were in the city.”\n“We should take no chances,” said Pike. “Inquisitor Teufel and I will set\nout for Valbeck this afternoon. Ensure that the city is… pure.”\nThat word might have given Orso a cold shiver once, but perhaps the\nbattle had washed away all his father’s good-natured indecision and\nexposed a flinty core of his mother’s cold-blooded scorn. The Union had to\nbe brought together now. Whatever it took.\n“Very good.” He drew his fur-trimmed cloak tight about his shoulders\nagainst the chilly autumn breeze and watched the corpse-gatherers at their\nwork.\nThe door squealed open to reveal a dim chamber, walls glistening with\ndamp, cut in half by rust-speckled gratings. Beyond, the wretched\noccupants of cells stuffed to bursting squinted into the light, shrank into the\nshadows, pressed themselves against the bars.\n“Former members of the Open Council,” said the Arch Lector, with\nperhaps the slightest hint of satisfaction in his voice, if not his face.\n“Awaiting the king’s justice.”\nHere they were, then. Some of the proud peacocks responsible for this\nepic disaster. There was little pride on display now. One listless young man\nhad a bloody bandage wrapped around one eye. Another had hands over his\nface, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. The extravagant uniforms were\ntorn and tattered, gold braid made muddy strings, glittering insignia of\nlegions that no longer existed turned to so much trash.\n“I must apologise for these quarters,” said Orso, stepping through the\ndoorway and wrinkling his nose at the stink. “I know they are not quite\nwhat you are used to.”\n“This is all a misunderstanding, Your Majesty!” one young lordling\nspluttered, face pressed so hard against the bars they left livid marks in the\nflesh to either side. “All a terrible misunderstanding!”\n“Shut up,” snarled one of the guards, bashing the bars with a stick and\nmaking him recoil.\nOrso had hoped to feel some satisfaction at the sight of his sneering\nadversaries from the benches of the Open Council ruined. But he felt mostly\nhollow, irritable and slightly disappointed that he felt nothing more. As if all\nmeaningful emotion for the year had been used up during the battle in one\nprofligate splurge.\n“Most of those lords who rebelled are dead or captured.” Pike’s burned\nlip wrinkled. “Lord Isher escaped, but we will hunt him down, along with\nall the rest.” He gestured towards a fat man whose blond hair stuck out at\nall angles, his uniform so ripped it was scarcely decent, large patches of\nscratched and hairy skin showing. “Lord Barezin was found tangled in a\nbriar patch. He fell from his horse while trying to flee.”\nEven having heard the name, Orso could scarcely recognise the man.\nBarezin drew himself up with the most dignity a man stripped of all dignity"

He fell from his horse while trying to flee.”\nEven having heard the name, Orso could scarcely recognise the man.\nBarezin drew himself up with the most dignity a man stripped of all dignity\ncould muster. “Your Majesty, I was hoping I might discuss with you—”\nOrso had no stomach for his excuses, still less his bargaining. “I think\neverything of importance was said yesterday, on the field.”\nLady Wetterlant glared from behind the bars of the cell next door. There\nwas an angry graze up one side of her face, but she did no pleading. “You\nmay have won,” she snapped, “but I have no regrets!”\nOrso gave a weary shrug. “Who cares?” he said.\n“Your Majesty.” Pike leaned close to murmur. “I suggest they all be\nhanged as soon as is practicable.”\nHell, Orso hated hangings. But making the things you hate come to pass\nseemed to be the main duty of a king.\n“See it done.” He shook his head. “What a bloody waste.”\nIt had been a morning of ugly shocks, but the sight of Leo dan Brock was\nsomehow the worst of all.\nA sheet was drawn up to his waist, but from its shape it was awfully\nclear that the surgeons had taken his left leg off above the knee. His left arm\nhardly looked better, wrapped in bandages to the shoulder, the dangling\nfingers swollen up like purple sausages. His chest, and his face, and his\nright arm were speckled with a hundred little nicks and scabs, stained with\nblue bruises. His mouth was bloated on one side, the gap of missing teeth\nshowing through his twisted lip. He looked to have aged twenty years. All\nthat indestructible bravado smashed out to leave him a shrivelled husk.\nOrso’s great rival, in more ways than one, lying hopeless and humbled at\nhis mercy. It should have been a proud moment. But all Orso felt was\nsadness. To see a man who’d been so enviably handsome, so ruined. To see\na man so representative of the warrior’s virtues, so crushed. To see a man\nwho’d stood so tall no room had seemed big enough, brought so horribly\nlow.\nHe had been a hero to many. The Young Lion!\nBy the Fates, look at him now.\n“Your Majesty,” he croaked out, in evident agony, his left arm useless as\nhe tried to wriggle up his pillow to a more seemly position. As if any\nposition was seemly for a man who had just lost half his limbs in one of the\nmost infamous defeats in Union history.\n“Your Grace.” The title was probably inappropriate now, but Orso hardly\nknew what else to say. He glanced up at Gorst, looming watchfully by the\ndoor. “You can leave us, Colonel.”\n“Your Majesty?”\n“What will he do?” snapped Orso. “Hop from his bed and bite me to\ndeath?”\nGorst lowered his eyes and trudged from the room, pulling the door\nshut. When Orso turned back, Brock had a pained grimace on his face.\n“Don’t you dare take exception to my fucking tone!” snapped Orso.\n“Among all this suffering, you’re one of the few who can truly say they"

You had everything. Wealth and status and admiration. Even\nyour bloody enemies liked you! Do you really believe your cronies would\nhave done so much better a job than mine?”\nBrock opened his mouth. Then he gave a wincing shrug, and a grunt of\npain, and his shoulders sagged. “Does it matter now?”\nThere was a silence, then Orso slumped even lower. “Very little.”\n“My wife…”\nOrso felt an ugly spasm through his face. The mere thought of Savine’s\nname was still painful. A splinter he could never work free. “Missing,” he\ngrowled. “But Arch Lector Pike has men searching for her. She will not get\nfar.”\n“She had no part in this—”\nOrso barked out a joyless laugh. “Please. As if she ever went into\nanything without her eyes wide open. I’ve no doubt she’s every bit as guilty\nas you are, if not more so. She doesn’t even have youth, stupidity and a\nmassively bloated sense of her own importance as excuses.”\nCruelty to a man so utterly broken in body and spirit did not help Orso\nin the least. It just made him feel cruel. He could be generous in victory,\ncouldn’t he? He had won, hadn’t he?\nSo why did he feel like he lost?\n“My friends…” croaked out Brock. His eyes looked a little wet. But\nperhaps that was from the agony.\n“Dead,” said Orso.\nBrock bared his teeth as he tried to shift back on his bed. They were pink\nwith blood still. “Can I ask… that they get a decent burial, at least?”\n“In a pit with the rest. I have hundreds of loyal men to bury. I can waste\nno effort on traitors.” Bloody hell, he hated this. He stood, shoving back his\nchair, and turned towards the door.\n“They were good men,” he heard Brock whisper. For some reason, it\nmade Orso feel exceptionally angry.\n“Good men and bad, they’re all meat now. If it’s any consolation, you\nwon’t need to worry about it long. Your hanging’s within the week.”\nAnd he strode for the door with his fists clenched.\nThe Truth\n“A\nh!”\n“My scripture teacher used to tell me…” murmured Zuri, eyes narrowed\nwith concentration as she stitched, “that pain is a blessing.”\n“I like the man less and less.” Savine managed a watery grin. “Not the\nfirst time your needle’s come to my rescue. Usually it’s been sewing on a\nloose button… rather than stitching my head together…” She noticed that\nZuri had a rip down one side of her dress, tightly wound bandages showing\nbeneath, and the brown dirt smeared around that rip was not dirt at all, but\ndry blood.\n“Zuri—”\n“No need to worry about me.” She did not take her eyes from her work."

That same\ndirt was caked all down the front. “It’s mine?”\n“My scripture teacher also told me…” still sewing as carefully and\nprecisely as ever, “that scalp wounds bleed a great deal.”\n“A man of varied interests.”\n“You have no idea.”\nWitty back and forth, as if they were discussing business on an ordinary\nday rather than hiding in a muddy hollow under the roots of a fallen tree,\nwith everything in utter ruins. Savine wrapped her arms around herself,\nwrapped her arms around her baby and felt it move, thank the Fates. Her\nshoulder, her side, her neck were one great stiff throb where she must have\nhit the ground. She could easily have been dead.\nA cannon had burst, that’s what Zuri told her. A splinter of metal had\ngrazed her head, ripped her wig off and knocked her flat. A little lower and\nit would have sprayed her brains across the hillside. She had missed the\nchaos of the rout, bouncing unconscious in the back of a wagon. A lady of\ntaste should appear to make no effort. The right things simply happen\naround her. She woke here in the woods, with the worst headache she’d\never had.\nShe could very easily have been dead.\nBut you know things are bad when you cling to that for comfort.\n“Ah!” she grunted as Zuri’s needle bit again.\n“Best stay quiet,” murmured Broad, squatting low beside the rotten\ncarcass of the tree trunk, light flashing on his lenses as he peered off into the\nwoods. His voice had a rough, hollow quality. “They’ll be hunting for us.”\nMeaning they would be hunting for her. “Of course. I’m sorry.” Savine\nclosed her eyes. How often had she said sorry before? Not often. And never\nreally felt it. But this was a different world.\n“How bad is it?” Her voice came very small. As if she hardly wanted an\nanswer.\n“Just a scratch.” There was no sign in Zuri’s face that she was lying. It\nwas Broad’s face that gave it away.\n“You’ve been stitching a long time for a scratch,” she croaked out.\n“You know me, I will not stand for sloppy needlework.” Zuri leaned\nclose to bite off the thread and sat back, frowning. “There might be a little\nscar. Something to add a dash of danger.”\nAs if they needed any extra danger. A scar was the least of Savine’s\nworries.\n“Done?” asked Broad, standing over them. He offered one big hand. The\none with the tattoo on its back. Savine noticed the knuckles were all\nscratched and scabbed. “Lady Savine?”\nShe stayed sitting. Watched the woodlice squirm among the rotten roots.\nHonestly, she was not sure she could get up. “Is my husband alive?”\n“When I last saw him.”\nShe got the feeling there was more to that story, but she hardly dared\nask. “He was hurt?”\nBroad added no sugar to it. “Badly.”"

Have to keep off the\nroads, make for the coast, then to Angland. We have to go now.”\n“Yes.” Savine took a long breath. “But not towards Angland. I’m going\nback to Stoffenbeck.”\n“What?” asked Zuri.\n“I have to surrender. It’s my best chance to save Leo.”\nMuscles squirmed on the side of Broad’s head. “Lady Savine, from what\nI saw, there might be no saving him—”\n“It’s my only chance to save myself. We have no supplies. The king’s\nforces are everywhere. My entourage is down to two and it’s two more than\nI deserve. We’ll never make it to the coast. Not with me the size of a\nhouse.”\n“You could go to your father,” murmured Zuri.\n“There’s nothing he could do. He resigned. Difficult to shield the king\nfrom treason when you have a traitor for a daughter. I did this to myself.”\nShe said it rather bitterly, for someone who had no one else to blame. “No\none can undo it. Even if I could get back to Angland, do we really think the\nInquisition would not reach me there?”\n“We can try,” said Broad.\n“You can.” Savine took his hand and gave it an awkward pat. “You\nshould. Go back to May and Liddy.” She smiled up at Zuri. A queasy,\nhopeless smile, since she honestly had no idea how she would make it to the\nedge of the woods by herself, let alone back to the battlefield. “You, too,\nZuri, you have your brothers to think about. The time has come for us to—”\n“I will come with you.”\nSavine stared at her. She had always liked to think of Zuri as a friend,\nbut she knew she was a paid one. Knew someone of her taste and talents\nmust once have had far higher ambitions than being a glorified maid.\nAmbitions that had been destroyed by whatever horrors she had fled from in\nGurkhul.

But loyalty was somehow more than she could bear. There\nwas no helping it. Savine put her hands over her face and started to cry.\nShe heard Broad give a weary sigh. “Reckon we’re all going back.”\nNo one challenged them on the way to Stoffenbeck.\nPerhaps those searching for her were far to the North, watching the coast\nfor her escape.

One to hold her bloated belly, one to hold\nher aching back, one to hold her throbbing head. She had no choice but to\nalternate between them, her shoulder aching with every step, breathing hard\nthrough her gritted teeth, while her baby quite literally kicked the piss out\nof her.\nShe cocooned herself in misery so she would not have to look right or\nleft. So she would not have to see the scorched orchard, the trampled\nwheatfields, the smoke still crawling up from Stoffenbeck, pounded to ruins\nby cannon so meticulously cast in her own foundry.\nAll the while, she told herself she could not be blamed.\nShe had not wanted any of this, after all. She had wanted to marry Orso.\nMore than anything. But she lost him because her mother once fucked a\nking. Curnsbick had been right, after Valbeck her judgement was no good.\nWhen Leo was served up to her, so handsome and celebrated and bursting\nwith potential, just the delightful pastry her jaded palate needed, what\nchoice did she have but to get her knife and fork out? And then, pregnant\nand puking and judgement even worse, what choice did she have but to\nmarry him? And then, finding he was already balls-deep in conspiracy with\nIsher, what choice did she have but to join them and do everything to make\na success of their preposterous scheme?\nMaking successes from men’s preposterous schemes was what she did,\nafter all.\nIt was terribly unfair on her, when you thought about it, that she had lost\neverything because of who her mother fucked, by definition some time\nbefore she was born.\nAnd then she thought of her father. Not King Jezal, the other one. The\nreal one, blood or no blood. Sitting in his wheeled chair, tongue touching\nhis empty gums and a brow critically raised. Perhaps after one of her\narrogant overreaches in the fencing circle. Really, Savine?\n“What have I done?” she whispered, and she sank down to one knee in\nthe road.\nIf she had really tried, if she had truly wanted to, she could have found a\nway to stop this. There were a thousand moments when she could have\nfound a way to stop this.\nInstead, she had fanned the flames. Instead, she had rolled the dice. And\nwhat for? Ambition. That snake twisted tight about her innards whose\nhunger grew sharper the more it was fed. Whose hunger could never be\nsatisfied.\nThe truth was, like all gamblers who suddenly lose big, she had only\nthought about what there was to win. Now she saw the scale of her loss, and\nit was no less than everything. And she had not only lost on her own behalf,\nbut for thousands of others. What would it mean for Zuri? What would it"

For Haroon and Rabik? For Liddy and May? By the Fates,\nwhat would it mean for her unborn child?\n“What have I done?”\nShe felt Zuri’s light hand on one shoulder. “My scripture teacher would\nno doubt have said…” She was frowning doubtfully out across the battered\nbattlefield. “That regret is the gateway to salvation…”\nSavine gave a disbelieving snort. “Can you really still believe in God?\nThat this is all part of some grand plan? That it means something?”\n“What is the alternative?” Zuri looked at her, eyes wide. “To believe that\nit means nothing?”\nSavine felt Broad’s heavy hand on her other shoulder. “No one makes a\nthing like this happen alone. We all had our hand in it.”\nShe slowly nodded. It would have been yet more appalling arrogance to\nsuppose it was all her fault. She winced as she struggled to her feet, took a\nhard breath and, with one hand under her belly and one pressed into her\nback, struggled on across the wounded fields towards Stoffenbeck.\nShe had played her part in this.\nAll that remained was to pay for it.\nShe was not sure how long she sat there, waiting, in an agony of guilt,\napprehension and, well, agony.\nThe pain in her head was getting no better. The pain in her bladder was\nmost certainly getting worse. Her baby was endlessly shifting. Perhaps it\nwas cursed with Leo’s impatience. Perhaps it was infected by her panic.\nPerhaps, like a rat scurrying from a foundering ship, it sensed she was going\ndown and desperately struggled to wriggle free of her.\nIt must have had its mother’s instinct for self-preservation. Savine would\nhave wriggled free of her own skin if she could.\nFrom time to time, she heard guards outside the door. Muffled voices.\nEven laughter. She was a prisoner, then. Something she had better get used\nto, she supposed. Along with being universally reviled, all she had built\nruined, her name used as a cheap joke or a warning lecture—\nThe door clattered open and she jerked up so suddenly she put a spasm\nthrough her back, nearly vomited and was trapped halfway to her feet,\nleaning on the chair with one trembling arm.\nOrso stared at her, frozen. As if he had arranged an expression of\nrighteous fury but on seeing her could not quite disguise his shock. Her\nbelly, and her head wound, and her ripped and bloody clothes took some\nadjusting to, she supposed. The righteous fury soon returned, though.\n“Don’t get up,” he snapped, though it was obvious she couldn’t have\nwithout block and tackle. She flopped back into the chair with all the grace\nof an ale keg with arms. Any trace of dignity she counted one of her least\npainful losses, at this point.\nHe shut the door, carefully not looking at her. He had changed, too.\nHarder. More purposeful. There was no hint of his old languid flourish as he\nstalked into the room with his fists clenched."

There was no hint of his old languid flourish as he\nstalked into the room with his fists clenched.\n“I was surprised to hear you had given yourself up. I felt sure you’d be\nslithering away somewhere to hatch some new scheme.” The room was\nwarm, but his voice was cold enough to make the hairs on her arms bristle.\n“I knew that surrendering…” Her voice sounded pathetically weak.\n“Was the best thing I could do…” She was used to holding all the cards.\nEven with Orso, she was used to holding some. Now he had the entire deck.\n“For my child—”\n“It’s a little late,” he barked at her, “to be thinking about that, don’t you\nthink? Now the dead are stacked five high in the fields?”\nSavine had not supposed they would trade quips like they used to. But\nshe had never really seen him angry before. She began to wonder if this had\nbeen a terrible mistake. If she should have run while she had the chance,\nand never stopped.\n“Were you a part of this?” He still refused to look at her, jaw muscles\nsquirming on the side of his face. It came to her forcefully that with a word\nhe could have her hanged beside all the rest. She would never have dreamed\nhe would do it until that moment. Now she was not so sure.\nLies would not help her. It had to be the truth. “Yes,” she whispered. “I\nhad a full part in it.”\n“I would’ve been amazed if you hadn’t. But somehow I kept hoping.”\nOrso bared his teeth. “I received a letter, some time ago, warning me of a\nconspiracy to steal my throne. A plot by members of the Open Council.\nWith friends in the North.”\nSavine closed her eyes. Rikke. It could only have been Rikke. She had\nnot merely let them down but betrayed them. Perhaps she really had seen\nthe future. Savine might almost have admired her tactics, had she any\nemotion to spare. It was very much the sort of thing she might have done\nherself. Not that it mattered now. When she opened her eyes, Orso was\nstaring at her with the strangest look.\n“Why?” he asked.\nSavine swallowed. She had planned the best way to frame it, how to\nsubtly shift the blame, each word picked out as carefully as an ensemble for\nthe theatre, but now the excuses burbled out in a half-baked rush. “They\nwere already planning it. Isher, and the rest. I had no choice. I could only\n—”\n“No.” Orso bit off every word. “I mean… why choose him… over me?”\nShe should have known he would ask. But she had told herself he no\nlonger cared. That it was buried and would never need to be dug up. Now\nshe realised her error, and she stared down at the carpet, her face burning,\nthe breath crawling in her throat.\n“What did I do? To make you turn on me?” He stepped closer, lips\ncurling back from his teeth. “Have you even got a heart?”\nShe did, and it was pounding now. She felt as if her battered skull was"

He gripped the arms of her chair with white knuckles and she\nshrank back, turning her face away as he leaned down over her, snarling,\nspitting, stabbing at his chest with a finger.\n“I loved you. I still fucking love you! How pathetic is that? After what\nyou’ve done!”\n“I’m sorry,” she whispered, “I’m so sorry—”\n“I don’t want your sorry, I want to know why!” He snarled the word over\nand over. “Why? Why? Why—”\n“Because I’m your sister!” she screamed in his face. She was revolted.\nShe was ashamed. She was terrified.\nShe was relieved.\nShe only realised then how the secret had eaten at her. She met his eye\nand gave a helpless shrug. “I’m your sister.”\nNever had she seen a man’s face so contorted with different extremes of\nemotion within a few moments. From fury, to bafflement, to disgust, to\ndisbelief. “What do you mean?” He flinched back. Jerked his hand from the\narm of her chair and held it up as if to ward off a blow. “What do you\nmean?”\n“I meant to say yes to you!” Her confession welled up, sickening as shit\nflooding from a broken sewer. “After Valbeck. That’s the truth. I wanted to.\nThat’s all I wanted. You were the one good thing… the only good thing… I\nwent to my mother…” She closed her eyes, felt tears burning at the lids. A\nlittle sadness. A lot of fear. “She told me… I couldn’t marry you. She told\nme… she, and your father…” She squeezed her eyes tighter shut, had to\nforce out the words. “They were lovers! Before he became king. And I was\nthe result. I’m your sister! Half-sister. That’s the truth. I didn’t—”\n“That’s a lie.” Orso’s face crushed up in disbelief. “That can’t be true.”\n“You know it is. I know it is. My father—” she gave a kind of cough,\n“Arch Lector Glokta, that is, he offered to marry my mother. So she would\nbe safe. He raised me as his own. I didn’t know. Not until she told me.\nThat’s the truth. And then… I didn’t know what I could do! I couldn’t\nmarry you. I couldn’t tell you why. Then seeing how you hated me for it…\nit was torture!” She found she was leaning towards him, reaching out for\nhim. “It still is torture.”\nHe stumbled back, clattering into a chair and sending it over backwards.\n“I lost my way after that!” She struggled up somehow, took a wobbling\nstep towards him. “I lost all my judgement. I was just… pretending… to be\nme. I was still trapped in Valbeck, somehow! I couldn’t see… past my own\nambitions… I didn’t have anything else!” Pathetic excuses, mangled in her\ndry mouth. “Leo… he’s a good man. He could be… but he’s so easily led."

I wanted… I don’t even\nknow what I wanted any more!”\nShe could hardly stand. She sank down on her knees. “I’m begging you\nfor mercy. For my husband. For myself. For our child.” Hands clasped, face\nwet with tears, nose clicking with snot. What a fucking cliché. “I know I\ndon’t deserve it, but it’s all I can do now. Please, Orso.”\nHe stared down at her, that hand still up as though to push her away. To\npush away what she was saying.\n“Gorst!” he shrieked.\n“No. Orso, please.” She almost clutched at his ankles. “I didn’t know.\nIt’s the truth—”\nThe door burst open and Bremer dan Gorst strode in. Huge. Merciless.\n“Get her out of here!”\nGorst took her under one arm. Oddly gentle. But utterly irresistible.\n“Please!” she blubbed as he half-marched her, half-carried her out.\n“Orso!” She clutched at a table in desperation and dragged it over, a pile of\nbooks scattering. “Please!”\nThe door slammed shut.\nThose Names\n“T\nhere’s the beacon fire!” squeaked Greenway, pointing off through the\nmist. “It’s Ollensand!”\n“Finally!” Stour stalked to the prow, shouldering Greenway aside for a\nbetter look. There was no missing the wriggling pinprick of light now, and\nthere were smiles all around at the thought of land, and food, and warmth,\nClover’s big as anyone’s. It had been quite the wearying voyage.\nThey’d scratched together a crew half his men, half Stour’s young\nbastards who’d lived through the battle. One had a wound in his back and\ndied after a night of groaning on the water. They’d rolled him over the side,\nthe only ceremony Clover’s observation that not everyone goes back to the\nmud after all. Some get the big drink instead. Greenway had looked green\nthe whole way, and especially green at that, Rikke’s prediction that he’d die\non water no doubt weighing on his mind.\n“Home again.” Clover shook some of the salt dew from the old blanket\naround his shoulders. He glanced at Sholla, sitting beside him with her arm\nover the tiller. “Quite a feat o’ navigation.”\n“Nothing to comment on,” she said modestly, though he knew she’d\nspent most of the nights awake, frowning at the stars and fretting over the\ncourse. Last thing they wanted was to land in the wrong place, after all, and\none bit of sea looks much like another.\nAll the way, Stour snapped and whined like a wounded wolf indeed.\nAnyone hoping a glimpse of the North would sweeten his mood was sorely\ndisappointed. All it did was remind him that he’d left with big ambitions\nand a few thousand men, and was coming back with neither."

All it did was remind him that he’d left with big ambitions\nand a few thousand men, and was coming back with neither.\n“Get the oars out and row us in, you bastards!” he snarled, that fine\nwolfskin cloak of his snapping as he stalked between the benches. He\nleaned against the mast to rub at the wound on his leg. “Fucking thing! It’s\nright on top o’ the one the Young Lion gave me!”\n“Seems a bonus,” Sholla murmured through tight lips. “You end up with\none wound not two.”\n“In my experience o’ the Great Wolf,” mused Clover, “and I have about\nas much these days as any man alive, he’s not prone to look on the sunny\nside. I’d best try and calm the bastard, eh?” He heaved out a sigh as he\nstood. “Doubt anyone else will.” And he pulled the damp blanket off and\ntossed it over Sholla’s head.\nMen scurried about the ship as that distant light grew brighter and was\njoined to either side by the grey rumour of the coast. Wood clonked, rope\nhissed and salt spray flew as they brought in the sailcloth and leaned to the\noars.\n“Ready for the shore?” Clover asked Downside as he passed, and the big\nman gave him a wink with that bloodshot eye, red from a blow to the head\nin the battle. Stour was still raging, o’ course, as he walked up. What else\nwould he be doing?\n“Not a moment too fucking soon! Fucking Union. Fucking disaster.” As\nthough failure had fallen out of the sky, rather than his having any hand in\nit.\nClover folded his arms and looked off towards the coast. “If no one lost,\nmy king, where’d be the pleasure in winning?”\nStour glared at him. Seemed he found that a touch too philosophical\nwhen he was still licking his wounds in the shadow of disappointment.\nClover gave it another try. “Aye, the Young Lion’s done, and you had a\ngood deal in common with him, a sympathetic ear in Angland and so on. No\ndoubt his loss is a terrible shame, but… did you really like him all that\nmuch?”\nStour frowned as Sholla slipped around him. “Sorry, my king, just have\nto get to the prow…”\nShe nodded at Clover, and he pulled Stour’s attention back by stepping\nclose, speaking soft, everyone’s friend. “Maybe he can’t help you take\nUffrith now, but, well… he can’t stop you taking it, either.” Clover stepped\ncloser yet, closer than men usually dared step to the Great Wolf. “Aye, we\nlost good men back there. But we lost good men before. In your father’s\nwars, and your grandfather’s wars. There’ll be more men. There’ll be more\nwars. You got to think of any battle you come out of alive as a victory and\nlook ahead to what comes next.”\nStour considered him.

        "text": "look ahead to what comes next.”\nStour considered him. A salt wind swept chill across the deck and stirred\nhis hair, ruffled the fine wolf’s pelt about his shoulders. Ollensand was\nslipping from the grey up ahead, ghosts of tall masts in the harbour and low\nhouses on the hillside, the beacon-fire burning brighter, joined by some\nfirefly dots of torches held by a little welcoming party on the longest wharf.\nThe oars creaked and rattled, somewhere on the high air a gull gave a\nlonely call, and Clover swallowed as the King of the Northmen turned that\nwet-eyed stare on him. Always an uncomfortable moment.\nThen, quick as the weather shifts in autumn, he grinned. “You’ve been\nloyal to me, Clover. I know I’m not always the easiest. No, no, don’t deny\nit.” No one had thought about denying it. “But if any man can talk me into\nlooking on the sunny side, it’s you.” He reached out and gave Clover a slap\non the shoulder. “You’ll get your reward, don’t worry about that.”\nClover matched him, grin for grin. “I know I will. And sooner’n you\nthink.”\nAnd Sholla slipped up from behind Stour, took the hilt of his sword and\nwhipped it from the scabbard.\nInstant later, Clover had him around the throat, butted him full in the\nmouth and snapped his head back. Clover snarled as he butted him again\nand felt Stour’s cheekbone crunch under his forehead. Stour gave a shocked\nlittle hoot as Clover butted him a third time. He’d had few sweeter feelings\nin his life than when he watched the King of the Northmen go sprawling on\nhis back beside the mast.\nGreenway’s jaw hung open. “What—” And Downside’s axe split his\nhead in half, spraying blood. Seemed Rikke had been right about him dying\non the water, and not just him. All over the boat, Clover’s boys stabbed the\nmen beside them, cut throats, smashed skulls, stuck blades in backs and\nfronts and sides. All done too close and too quiet and too sudden for\nswords. Just the way Clover always said it should be done. Far faster than\nwhen Stour killed Scale and his men. Far neater.\nBy the time the Great Wolf shook his head, spitting blood, Clover’s boys\nwere already rooting through the corpses of his bastards for anything worth\nthe taking. Stour blinked, like he hadn’t quite caught up yet, and found\nGreenway staring back at him. Well, one side of his head was, the other it\nwas hard to tell. Stour’s bloody lip twisted as he tried to sit up, but Clover\nput a boot on his chest and shoved him back down.\n“Best stay there, I reckon.”\n“You futhing traithor!” He spluttered red through his broken mouth, the\nchain Bethod once wore all tangled up around his neck.\n“Traitor, did he say?” Clover raised a brow at Downside. Downside\nshrugged and set to wiping Greenway’s brains off his axe. “Traitor, did you\nsay?” Clover shoved Stour down again and smiled. After so long under this\nlittle shit’s boot, felt awfully nice to have their positions swapped about."

After so long under this\nlittle shit’s boot, felt awfully nice to have their positions swapped about.\n“You got some bones, calling me traitor,” he said. “You, who murdered\nyour own uncle. All I’ve done is what I always told you to do. Wait for your\nmoment. Then go all the way.” He leaned down closer. “It’s just you\nweren’t fucking listening.”\nThere were raised voices up near the prow. One of Stour’s men left\nalive. Couple of the boys were arguing ’cause it seemed he was someone’s\ncousin and a good enough fellow by all accounts and letting him live would\nbe a fine thing for his old mother.\nClover gave Downside an impatient flick of the head, and Downside\nstepped up and ended the argument with his axe in much the same way he’d\nended Greenway. Once you’ve chosen your moment, holding back is folly.\nHolding back is cowardice.\nStour opened his mouth again but Sholla shut him up by brushing his\ncheek with the point of his own sword, and Clover leaned down and undid\nthe buckle on his cloak, and dragged it free of him, and swept it around his\nown shoulders.\n“Always liked this,” he said, rubbing his cheek against that fine fur.\n“Suits you,” said Sholla.\nThe men finished up their robbing of the dead and set to the oars. A\nskeleton crew, maybe, but enough to bring the ship in. One grey Northern\ncity on the grey Northern coast looks much like another, but as the oars kept\ndipping, they could all see it wasn’t Ollensand coming up out of the mist at\nall, but Uffrith. The light they’d seen wasn’t a beacon on a hill, but a bonfire\nin a cage up on a high pole beside the wharf.\n“Quite a piece of navigating,” said Clover.\nSholla allowed herself a grin rare as the Northern sun. “Nothing to\ncomment on.”\nThere were men waiting in the light of the fake beacon, just as they’d\narranged. Hard-bitten men with weapons, scars and scowls in abundance.\nClover knew a few faces. Named Men of Uffrith and the West Valleys, the\nNail standing among ’em in that crookback slouch of his with thumbs in his\nsword-belt. At their front, arms folded, metal eye glinting through his long\nhair, stood Caul Shivers.\n“You brought him, then,” he said as Clover clambered somewhat\nungainly from the ship, wood of the wharf feeling unsteady under his sea\nlegs.\n“I said I would. Did you think I wouldn’t?”\n“I gave you about a one in three. You know the Nail?”\n“By reputation,” said Clover.\nThe Nail grinned, all teeth and menace. “It’s a good one, ain’t it?”\n“It’s a peach. Must say I’m sorry about your father.”\n“Not as sorry as he’s going to be.” The Nail grinned even wider as\nDownside hauled Stour from the boat, hands trussed tight behind him.\n“Well, well, well!” And he gave a flourishing bow fine as any Union\ncourtier might have managed. “The King o’ the Northmen comes home!”"

You remember? The one in\nSkarling’s Hall? The one you kept my da in?”\n“Aye, I remember,” spat Stour. “Remember how he pissed himself and\ncried like—”\nHe was an odd-looking bastard, the Nail, all stringy and loose, all\nshoulders and elbows. But Clover never saw a man hit so fast. From\nnowhere, his fist crunched into Stour’s ribs and the King of the Northmen\ndoubled up, wheezing out a long string of drool, the diamond on his chain\ndangling.\n“Ow,” said Sholla, deadpan.\n“Funny,” said the Nail, back in his floppy slouch already. “Barbs don’t\nsting so much from a man you can slap whenever you please.”\nSeemed that punch knocked out all Stour’s bluster. It can get that way,\nwith men who’re always giving blows but never called upon to take ’em.\n“Look…” Gulping and glugging as he struggled for his breath. “I’ll give…\ntwice what… she’s giving!”\nClover grinned. “All I’m getting is the chance to butt you in the face.\nWell, that and the cloak.”\n“Fight me, you bastards!” Stour struggled at the ropes round his wrists,\nprovoking nothing but another round o’ chuckles.\n“We already fought,” said Clover. “And you lost. You lost everything.”\n“I’m the greatest swordsman in the Circle of the World!”\nThe Nail gave a high little titter. “Can’t see it. To be a swordsman you\nhave to be able to stand up.” And he bent down, grabbed hold of two fistfuls\nof Stour’s trouser legs and yanked them down hard. Yanked them right\ndown to his ankles.\n“What’re you doing?” he squealed, twisting and struggling, but\nDownside had him under one arm now and the Nail under the other and he\nwasn’t going far with them two holding on.\nShivers took out a knife. A small knife, it was, with a bright little blade.\nBut a knife don’t have to be big to change things. Stour stared at it, over his\nshoulder, his eyes wet now, all right, but with fear rather’n threat.\n“What’re you doing?”\nClover caught him by the jaw and hissed the words in his face. “Giving\nyou your last lesson.

Sholla\nwinced and looked the other way. Downside frowned, and held Stour tight,\ncareless as a shepherd holding a sheep for shearing. The Nail grinned like\nhe’d never heard such a joke.\n“Come on,” he called over Stour’s squealing. “Ain’t fair to leave a man\nlopsided!”\nShivers shrugged, good eye showing no more feeling than his metal one,\nand he did the same to Stour’s other knee.\nClover tucked the king’s chain into a pocket in his new cloak and\nwatched, arms folded. He didn’t think much of vengeance, in the main, and\nit had been a long time since he took much pleasure in other men’s pain, but\nhe had to admit this felt good. Not so good as having Wonderful still around\nmight have. But it was something.\n“Best get him bandaged.” Shivers carefully wiped his little knife clean\non a rag. “Don’t want him bleeding out.” He glanced sideways at Clover\nand gave him a nod. “Glad you came to see things our way.”\n“I always did.” Clover watched as the Nail dragged the King of the\nNorthmen away, squealing and crying, his blood-streaked bare legs\ndragging and the jewelled buckle on his belt bouncing and clattering after.\n“Just waiting for my moment.”\nA Footnote to History\nC\nlimbing the steps to the platform might’ve been the hardest thing Leo\nhad ever done, but he was determined to get there on his own.

No longer a warrior. No longer a leader. No\nlonger a Lord Governor. He’d be a footnote to history. A man who turned\nhimself from hero to villain with his own arrogance, and recklessness, and\n—\nHe gave a whoop as his crutch slipped on the top step and spun from his\nhand. He clutched at nothing, then the side of his face banged hard into the\nplatform. He heard a few gasps, a whimper from somewhere. Maybe him.\nHis left arm was close to useless. With an agonising effort he could lift\nthe hand, produce the slightest trembling twitch in the first finger, but the\nrest dangled limp. He barely felt a pin stuck into them. The surgeon said\nmetal blasted from a cannon, along with bits of his shield, had riddled his\narm and ruined the nerves. They’d stitched the wounds but there was\nnothing more to do. And the irony was, they were healing a man they were\nabout to hang.\nHe worked himself up with his good arm, teeth gritted, managed to ease\nhis right leg under him, groaning as his weight went onto the stump of his\nleft. But once he’d made it to hands and knees—or hand and knee, at any\nrate—how to get further? He couldn’t reach for the crutch without falling,\nand even if he could, how would he push himself up? There’d been a time\nwhen achieving the impossible for Leo dan Brock had meant besting the\ngreatest swordsman of the age, or breaking an enemy’s line single-handed,\nor turning the tide of war against the odds. Now achieving the impossible\nmeant standing up.\nHe felt a firm hand under his elbow and was lifted carefully to his feet.\nOr foot. “There we go.” The crutch was wedged into his armpit again. He\nglanced sideways to see one of the executioners. Kind brown eyes through\nthe holes in his black mask as he helped Leo forward.\n“I’m fine,” said Leo, weakly shaking the man off.\nFine. Broken, defeated, in constant agony, with a useless arm and an\namputated leg, convicted of treason and already on the gallows. Fine.\nHe blinked about at the ruined town square of Stoffenbeck. The scene of\nhis crime, and now of his punishment. The corpses had been hauled away\nbut there were still heaps of rubble in every corner, only blackened pillars\nleft of the ruined market hall where his last charge foundered. The shattered\nclock tower loomed above, its one remaining face with hands frozen at the\nmoment of his downfall. The place still smelled faintly of burning.\nEleven of his fellow conspirators stood in a row on the platform, all with\nhands tied behind them, all watching him. Some he didn’t even recognise.\nLord Mustred was at the far end, bloody bandages wrapped around one eye.\nLady Wetterlant, even now keeping her pointed chin high. Lord Barezin,\nclosest to Leo, blinking about as though he could hardly believe what had\nhappened. What was happening. At the feet of each one of them was a\ntrapdoor. Beside each one of them was a lever. Above each one of them was\na noose."

Strangely banal. He’d hardly known what to\nexpect. Yet another irony. The first hanging he’d ever attended would be his\nown.\nWith jaw clenched, he hopped to the trapdoor and stood swaying, each\nbreath a smothered groan. There was a taste in his mouth. Blood from the\nfall, maybe. Or a lingering sweetness from his breakfast. He licked at the\ngrooves between his teeth, trying to root out more. Tiny pleasures seem\nhuge when you know there’s no time left. All the wonderful things he used\nto have, used to do, that he’d hardly noticed, let alone appreciated. Now a\nsweet taste on his gums was a bounty to feel thankful for.\nHe glanced up. The sun bright in the sky. The long beam black\noverhead. The nooses dangling down. His noose, right above him. He\nwondered how many necks had already been stretched by it. After what\nhe’d done, there were a lot of traitors to hang. They might’ve done ten\nbatches already today. From the cellars where they’d been keeping the\nprisoners, you could just hear the clatter as the trapdoors dropped open. The\nthud as the ropes stretched taut. The faint gasp of the onlookers, each and\nevery time.\nWas there dried blood on the rope? He felt vaguely affronted by that. For\nsomething so intimate, each person should surely get their own. Felt like\ndying in another man’s underwear. Though the underwear of those who’d\ngone ahead was no doubt in a far worse state. People pissed and shat and\nleaked every fluid when they were hanged, he knew. It had seemed quite a\nlaugh when Antaup told them all about it over drinks. Didn’t seem much of\na laugh now, needless to say.\n“Havel dan Mustred!”\nLeo looked down, blinking. It was only now that he noticed the\naudience. Not a large one, and most of them strangers, seated on an\nassortment of battered chairs dragged from the wrecked buildings about the\nsquare. It was Lord Chamberlain Hoff who spoke, droning the name from\nan ink-spotted list. “You are found guilty of High Treason and open\nrebellion against the Crown and sentenced to death.” King Orso sat beside\nhim, scarcely looking like he was enjoying this any more than the convicts.\n“Have you anything to say?”\n“I did not fight against my king,” growled out Mustred, “I fought for\nAngland. That’s all.”\nOn the king’s other side, Lord Marshal Rucksted gave a great snort of\ncontempt. The worms of the Closed Council. But Leo could summon up no\nhatred. He saw now that their tyranny had only been an excuse, and a flimsy\none too. All he’d wanted was an enemy to fight. Jurand had been right about\nthat. Jurand had been right about everything. The one consolation was that\nhis best friend could remember him as he had been. Would never have to\nsee him… like this.\nIt was better to imagine that Leo dan Brock died on the battlefield. It"

It\nwas true, in every way that mattered. He’d been a great fire, burning\nbrightly. Why cry at the snuffing out of the feeble ember that remained?\nOne of the executioners offered Mustred a hood. He shook his head. He\nwas guided onto his trapdoor, and as the noose was pulled tight, Hoff was\nalready naming the next in the line of the doomed.\nLeo’s bleary eyes wandered across the faces in the audience. Not far\nfrom the king sat a gaunt woman with close-clipped hair and a bandaged\nforehead. He wondered for a moment why she was looking at him with\nsuch desperate intensity. Then he let out a gasp, and the one knee he still\nhad began to tremble so badly he nearly fell again.\nIt was his wife.\nHe’d never seen her stripped of all artifice before. Without her paint, her\nwig, her jewels, her dozen attendants, her hundred carefully calibrated\nsmiles. He realised now that even her appearances at breakfast had been\ncarefully staged. Even her appearances in bed. Especially those, maybe. It\nseemed she’d emerged from the Battle of Stoffenbeck almost as broken as\nhe was.\nBut it was her.\nWhat should he have felt, to see her in the audience at his execution?\nUseless guilt, at what had become of her? Impotent anger, that she’d urged\nhim on? Sappy sorrow, that he wouldn’t see his child born? You’d have\nthought a man with only a few breaths left would have no time to waste on\nshame, but shame was what won. A crushing weight of it. At how pitiful he\nmust look. At how badly he’d let her down. At how little was left of the\nman she’d married.\nHe could hardly bear to look at her. Even though hers was the only\nsympathetic face in the whole ruined square. Because hers was the only\nsympathetic face. At the sight of her, he might realise all he was about to\nlose.\nHoff was still naming the convicted. Each faced death their own way.\nSome raged against the world. Some tearfully begged forgiveness. Lady\nWetterlant barked insults at every witness until the king ordered her gagged.\nOne young man with broken eye-lenses started to make a speech on the\ndeficiencies of monarchy, maybe hoping to bore a pardon from the king.\nOrso cut him off after a minute or two with a curt, “If you wanted to change\nthe world you should have won.”\nThere were even different kinds of silence. An obstinate refusal to speak.\nA baffled inability to understand what was happening. A lip-trembling,\nstuttering, quivering fear.\n“Stevan dan Barezin, you are found guilty of High Treason and open\nrebellion against the Crown and sentenced to death. Have you anything to\nsay?”\n“I have,” croaked out Barezin, jowls wobbling as he turned to stare at\nLeo. “It was Leo dan Brock that brought us to this! He was the instigator!\nHe was the perpetrator! It was you that brought us to this, you bloody fool!”"

It was you that brought us to this, you bloody fool!”\nThere were a dozen other people who’d brought them to this. A hundred.\nIsher, nowhere now to be seen, had sown the seed. Heugen and Barezin\nhimself had eagerly watered the sprouts. Savine and Stour had their parts in\ntending the crop. Even Rikke and the Breakers, by going back on their\nword, had helped bring in this harvest of hangings.\nBut Leo didn’t have the strength to defend himself. He hardly had the\nstrength to look up. Without him, it could never have happened. Why not\nshoulder the blame? He wouldn’t have to carry it for long.\n“I throw myself on your mercy, Your Majesty!” Barezin was almost\nsobbing. “It was all Brock!”\n“You damn coward!” snarled Mustred from the far end of the line.\nThe blubbing brought nothing but contempt from His Majesty in any\ncase. “Stick a hood on him,” he snapped, and Barezin squawked as the hood\nwas shoved over his head and the noose pulled tight.\nLeo saw now that his father had been wrong. It’s after the battle. That’s\nwhen a man finds out who he truly is.\nHe was no hero. He never had been. He was a fool. A great bloated\ntower of vanity. It had got his friends, his allies and hundreds who’d\nfollowed him killed. Now it would get him killed, too. He wondered for a\nmoment if he might’ve become a better man for the lessons he’d learned\nhere. He stared down at that endlessly throbbing leg that wasn’t there. It\nhardly mattered now, did it? He’d go back to the mud, as the Northmen say,\nand all the hard-learned lessons with him.\n“Leonault dan Brock, you are found guilty of High Treason and open\nrebellion against the Crown and sentenced to death. Have you anything to\nsay?”\nThe whole while, as he listened to the others rage, blurt, weep, reason,\nall to no purpose, he’d wondered what he’d say. Now the moment came, the\nlast moment, he found he had nothing.\nHe looked up at Orso and shrugged. “I’m sorry.” He hardly even\nrecognised his own voice any more, throaty and weak. He looked over at\nSavine. “I’m sorry, that’s all.” If he stood much longer, he’d fall. If he\nlooked at her much longer, he’d weep. He shook his head as he was offered\nthe hood. “Let’s get on with it.” And he did his best to lift his chin so it was\neasy to tighten the noose about his throat.\n“Most kind,” murmured the executioner.\nHoff rolled up his list of names and tucked it in the pocket of his robes.\nRucksted brushed dust from his shoulder. An ordinary-looking, curly haired\nfellow leaned forward to murmur something in the king’s ear. Something\nfamiliar about him.

King Orso gave the executioners a quick nod and they\npulled the first lever.\nLeo flinched as Mustred dropped with a clatter and a thud, and a set of\ncrows that had gathered on the bare beams of a fallen roof flapped outraged\ninto the sky.\nOnce they’d started it went shockingly fast. Bang, and the second man\nwas gone, rope trembling. Bang, and the third vanished. The young lecturer\nin governmental theory was next. He squeezed his face tight before he\ndropped, like a boy jumping into a cold millpond. By some freak chance,\nhis eye-lenses must’ve bounced off at the bottom, spun back up through the\ntrapdoor to rest on the platform. One of the executioners bent and slipped\nthem into his pocket.\nLeo’s life was measured in moments now. In breaths. In heartbeats. He\ndidn’t want to look, couldn’t look away, winced as the executioner pulled\nLady Wetterlant’s lever—\nShe didn’t drop.\nHe pulled the lever again, and again. The trapdoor refused to open.\n“Damn it,” came muffled from behind his mask. Orso squirmed in his\nchair. Hoff rubbed at his temples.\nAnother executioner stepped forward to mutter with the first, pointing\nangrily at the trapdoor. Lady Wetterlant growled into her gag. Four ropes\nstretched taut. Seven prisoners still stood, waiting helplessly for the end.\nOne of the executioners started kicking at the trapdoor while another\ndragged pointlessly at the lever again. A third had ducked under the\nplatform and could be heard scrabbling with the mechanism below.\nLeo bared his teeth. An agony of waiting. Each moment a horror, but\nstill a moment he was grateful for. The onlookers coughed and narrowed\ntheir eyes as a gust of wind swept grit across the ruined square. A few\nnooses down, one of the conspirators sobbed inside his hood.\n“Fuck yourselves, you bastards!” Lady Wetterlant had worked free of\nher gag and now started screaming insults again. “Damn you all, you\nvultures! You worms!”\nKing Orso jumped up. “For pity’s sake, just—”\nHer trapdoor sprang suddenly open. She had been turning, fell\nawkwardly, scream suddenly cut off as she caught her arm on the edge of\nthe platform and slithered through. It soon became clear that the drop hadn’t\nkilled her. The rope twitched wildly. A kind of spluttering groan came from\nbelow. Everyone stared as it became a spitty gurgle.\nLeo saw piss run from the trouser leg of the man who’d been sobbing to\npool on the platform around his boot.\n“Proceed,” said Hoff, angrily.\nThe next man swooned, knees giving and dropping to the platform. One\nof the executioners dragged him up, slapped his hooded face, stood him\nstraight on his trapdoor. Clatter and thud as he dropped.\nAs if making up for lost time, they rushed from one lever to the next."

The executioner grasped his lever. “Wait!” came muffled\nfrom under the hood. “I—”\nHe dropped under the platform and with a snap his rope jerked tight. So\nit seemed great lords of the Open Council meet the long drop just like other\nmen.\nLeo looked up at Savine. She gave a desperate smile, tears in her eyes.\nMeant to give him strength, maybe. He’d never loved her like he did at that\nmoment. Perhaps he’d never really loved her until that moment. He tried to\nsmile back. To leave her with something good. Some glimpse of who he\nused to be.\nHe felt the executioner step up beside him. Heard him grip the lever that\nworked the trapdoor under his feet. Under his foot. Still wasn’t used to\nhaving just the one. He closed his eyes.\nTime stretched. A breeze came up and kissed his sweaty face. He took a\nlong breath out, and held it. His last breath, he realised.

One of the crows, gathered again on the naked beams, flapped\nits wings. Barezin’s taut rope still hummed faintly. The executioner’s hand\nshifted on the lever.\nThen Orso slumped back in his chair and gave a sharp wave of his hand.\n“Leo dan Brock, I commute your sentence to life imprisonment.”\nThere was a collective gasp.

The place\nlooked nothing like the last time she was there, in the final chaotic days of\nthe uprising. No rubbish choking the streets, no burned-out shells of\nbuildings, no sounds of distant violence, no unattended corpses. Only a few\npink smears showing through the hastily applied whitewash, reminding the\ncareful observer that these buildings were once daubed with Burners’\nslogans. There was even a pleasant breeze, carrying the smog of the rebuilt\nmanufactories away inland and leaving the air halfway clean.\nAll quiet and orderly. Almost too quiet, the few people in the streets\nscurrying off to stare from alleys and doorways. But then cheering crowds\nmight be too much to ask for when the Arch Lector of the Inquisition\narrives in your city with thirty armed Practicals. Pike’s last visit, after all,\nhad left the road out of town decorated with hanged men.\n“No sign of revolution,” murmured Vick.\n“No,” said Pike. “You sound… almost disappointed.”\nShe looked sharply sideways. His Eminence stared straight back at her,\neyes bright in his burned mask of a face. No way to tell what he was\nthinking. There never was. But she saw the danger hidden in the\nobservation. Like a cake full of nails.\n“No one’s fought harder to stop the Breakers than I have,” she said.\n“I am well aware! You scotched their schemes in Adua with impressive\nruthlessness. And we could not have dealt so smoothly with the uprising\nhere without your efforts. Nobody doubts your loyalty.”\n“Good,” said Vick. She had become acutely aware how many Practicals\nwere surrounding her.\n“To Arch Lector Glokta.” And she felt the hairs stand on the back of her\nneck. “He was the one who helped you escape the camps, after all. Who\ngave you a new life. Who moulded you into such a formidable spy. But\nGlokta is gone.” Pike gave the sigh of a mourner at a funeral, if not the\ntears. “And your loyalty to me is quite another question. I, after all, have\ndone nothing to earn it. To count upon it so lightly would be awfully\npresumptuous.”\n“The Breakers are traitors,” said Vick. Stick to the official line. He could\nonly judge her on what she said, not what she thought. “Enemies of the\nking. There’s nothing to sympathise with.”\n“Nothing?” They rode beneath the towering crane at the edge of a\ndeserted building site, Pike’s eyes hidden in the sudden darkness of its\nshadow. “Do you really think so? Can you really think so? A good soldier\nfights in a world of black and white. He must make monsters of his\nenemies. The devious Southerner, the degenerate Styrian, the barbaric\nNorthman, the treacherous Breaker. But a good spy must swim in an ocean\nof grey, swept by unpredictable currents, far out of sight of land.

Despite your efforts\nto prove the contrary, you are not made of stone, Inquisitor. None of us are.\nProud men like Sibalt. Noble men like Malmer. How could you not\nsympathise? Given where you come from?”\n“Adua?” Vick kept her face neutral, but behind the mask her mind was\nracing. Was he trying to trap her? Say she had no sympathy with the\nBreakers, and he’d call her a liar. Say she had sympathy, he’d call her a\ntraitor.\n“I meant the prison camps of Angland. I have come to believe… that the\nheart of a society… is revealed in its prisons.” Pike rocked gently with the\nmovement of his horse, eyes fixed up the empty street ahead. “I was not\nthere nearly as long as you, but long enough to lose my face. Honestly, I\nwas never a handsome man. I daresay I turn more heads now. Your scars\nmay not show quite so clearly, but I never doubt you have them. So I\nbelieve I understand you.”\n“Really?” In spite of all her efforts, her voice sounded strangled.\n“Oh, yes. I believe I understand you better than you understand\nyourself.”\nIt worried her that Pike was suddenly so talkative. It made her think that\nhe was working his way to something, and she would not like it at all when\nthey got there. She had the feeling, yet again, that this was one of those\nmoments when her life hung by a thread. But when she faced Sibalt,\nRisinau, Vitari, Savine dan Brock, she had gone in with her eyes open, had\nknown the line she must walk. What Pike wanted was a mystery.\n“It was Colonel West who pulled me from the camps,” he mused,\n“without the slightest idea that we had known each other years before. In\nhis company I even held a shield in a duel, if you can believe that. When the\nBloody-Nine beat the Feared and made himself King of the Northmen! Life\nis… such a cobweb of coincidences, isn’t it? West was a man one could\nadmire.” He gave a sorry sigh. “But the truly good men never seem to last.\nHe died, and I began to work with Arch Lector Glokta. Even though I knew\nhe was far from a good man. Even though he was the very man who had\nsent me to the camps in the first place. Does any of this sound familiar?”\nIt did. Not the part about holding a shield in a duel, but otherwise quite\nuncomfortably so.\nPike watched a nervous-looking set of labourers clear out of their way to\nhuddle against the houses as they clattered past. “In the name of justice, I\ntortured dissenters in Adua. In the name of freedom, I imprisoned rebels in\nStarikland. In the name of order, I spread chaos across the Far Country. I\nwas as loyal a servant as the Crown ever had.”\nVick couldn’t help but frown at that choice of words. “Was?”\n“Then the manufactories started to spring up, and the unrest began"

It was deserted now, except for well-armed guards\nposted at the corners and clustered on the steps of the courthouse where\nJudge had tossed out death sentences. Men with fine new breastplates, fine\nnew halberds, fine new swords, everything twinkling in the autumn sun.\nA double row of them was drawn up in front of the rebuilt Valbeck\nbranch of Valint and Balk, a temple to debt more magnificent than ever,\nscaffolding clinging to its pillared façade so sculptors could finish a frieze\nof history’s richest merchants upon its giant pediment.\n“Who are these?” muttered Vick. Some private militia, hired to keep the\npeace with the king’s soldiers gone? But something didn’t fit. Rough-\nlooking men, all standing their own way. Clean armour, maybe, but\nunshaven faces.\nPike didn’t look concerned. You might almost have called him jaunty as\nhe led them across the empty square at a trot, past the vacant pedestals of\nstatues torn down during the uprising to the bank’s front steps. That double\nrow of armed men parted and two figures came from the midst. Two\nawfully familiar figures. One was a fat man in a well-cut suit, the other a\ntall, lean woman in a dress stitched from many-coloured rags, a rust-eaten\nbreastplate over the top, her red hair pinned into a bonfire tangle.\n“Fuck,” breathed Vick. Not often she was at a loss for words, but right\nthen she had nothing better.\n“Victarine dan Teufel!” called Risinau, the light of pious belief burning\nas brightly in his eyes as ever.\n“Unless I’m much mistook,” sneered Judge, the light of angry madness\nburning even brighter in hers, “which I’m not often.”\nFirst thing Vick thought was that they’d fallen into a trap. Then Pike\nspread his arms wide. “My friends!” he called as he swung down from his\nsaddle to meet them. “My children!” And he kissed Risinau on the\nforehead, and did the same to Judge, all smiling as if this was a family\nreunion long put off, while the armed men thumped the butts of their\nhalberds against the steps and sent up an approving rattle.\nLike every puzzle, once Vick knew the answer, she couldn’t understand\nhow she hadn’t seen it right away. She was the one who’d fallen into the\ntrap. She alone.\n“You’re the Weaver,” she said.\n“A name I have used, at times.” Pike gestured to the soot-stained old\nbuildings around the square, the new chimneys looming beyond their roofs.\n“So much has changed since I was the Superior here.

She swung her leg\nover the saddle and stepped down to the square.\n“I called the like-minded people I gathered the Breakers,” said Pike,\nwatching Judge set her torch to oil-soaked wood at the bank’s doors. “Not\nbecause we would break machines, though we have, but because we would\nbreak the Union. Break it, and rebuild it in a new way. A better way.” Pike\nwatched the flames lick at Valint and Balk’s fine new stonework and the\narmed Breakers gathered in the square gave a great cheer. “The banks have\ntwisted about the nation like ivy about a tree, choking all life from it,\ncorrupting everything. So it is fitting that the destruction begins with this\nmonument to exploitation. But it will not stop there.” He turned towards\nVick. “The uprising the Closed Council so feared… has already happened.”\n“Three days ago,” said Risinau, rubbing his hands delightedly, “while\nKing Orso was winning his great victory against the rebels. They wanted us\nto distract the king’s men for them. Instead, they distracted the king’s men\nfor us!”\n“And not just here in Valbeck,” said Pike. “By now, Keln and Holsthorm\nand many of the smaller cities of the Union will be in the hands of the\nBreakers, too.”\n“In the hands of their people!” frothed Risinau, wagging a fat finger.\n“And Adua will be next. Our day is finally come!” And the men cheered\nlouder than ever.\nVick had smugly thought she knew how things really were. Simple as\nthat, everything was turned upside down. “What the hell do you want from\nme?” she asked.\n“You served Glokta faithfully,” said Pike. “Admirably, even. Because he\nwas the one man who ever gave you anything. Even if it was only the\nchance to wear the boot, rather than having it ground into your face.” He\ndid understand her, damn it. Maybe not better than she understood herself,"

Maybe not better than she understood herself,\nbut well enough. “I would like to offer you something more.”\nThe silence stretched out, broken by the laughter and whoops of the\narmed Breakers, the crackle of flames, the tinkle of shattering glass.\n“Well, don’t keep me in suspense,” said Vick. Seemed to her she’d get\nnothing with meekness. She never had before. “What are you offering?”\n“Join us,” said Pike. “Become a Breaker. Give the Union back to its\npeople and shape the future. Commit yourself to a cause worthy of your\nloyalty.”\n“I gave up on causes when I left the camps.”\n“All the better.” Pike glanced at Judge, who was tossing her torch\nthrough the bank’s doors and backing down the steps, a thin, black figure\nagainst the rising flames with her fists thrust up in triumph. “A movement\nneeds passionate believers. But it needs calculating sceptics, too.”\nVick glanced across the smiles of the armoured men on the steps, lit by\nthe flickering fires above. No shortage of belief there. “And my other\noption?”\n“Leave. Go back to King Orso. Serve his corrupt regime in its dying\ndays. Or run to distant Thond, for that matter, where they worship the sun.\nGo with our blessing.”\nVick thought of the long line of hanged men Pike had left outside the\ncity, a few months before. She’d thought him ruthless then. Now it turned\nout they’d been his own people. A man who’ll waste no time hanging two\nhundred of his friends… what might he do to his enemies? Smoke was\nalready pouring from the windows of the bank, giving every breath the\nfamiliar char and fury stink of Valbeck she so well remembered.\nMaybe he was telling the truth, and if she chose to stick with Orso\nthey’d let her swan out of the city and off on her merry way. But she wasn’t\nabout to bet her life on it.\nIf she’d learned one thing in the camps, it’s that you stand with the\nwinners.\n“I’m with you,” she said, simply. Why say any more?\nPike held out one burned hand towards her while behind him the\nValbeck branch of Valint and Balk went up in towering flames for a second\ntime. “Then come, Sister Teufel! There is much to be done if we are to give\nthe people what they need.”\n“Which is?”\n“Change.” Pike put that hand on her shoulder and guided her away\nacross the square. “A Great Change.”\nAcknowledgments\nAs always, four people without whom:\nBren Abercrombie, whose eyes are sore from reading it.\nNick Abercrombie, whose ears are sore from hearing about it.\nRob Abercrombie, whose fingers are sore from turning the pages.\nLou Abercrombie, whose arms are sore from holding me up.\nThen, my heartfelt thanks:\nTo all the lovely and talented people in British publishing who have helped\nbring the First Law books to readers down the years, including but by no\nmeans limited to Simon Spanton, Jon Weir, Jen McMenemy, Mark Stay, Jon\nWood, Malcolm Edwards, David Shelley, Katie Espiner and Sarah Benton."
