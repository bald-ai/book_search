Let us rise\nup!”\nElysée Loustallot\nLike a King\n“Y\nou know something, Tunny?”\nThe corporal’s lightly bloodshot eyes slid towards Orso. “Your\nMajesty?”\n“I must confess to feeling rather pleased with myself.”\nThe Steadfast Standard rippled on the breeze, its white horse rampant\nand its golden sun aglitter, the name of Stoffenbeck already stitched among\nthe famous victories it had witnessed. How many High Kings had ridden\ntriumphant beneath that gleaming scrap of cloth? And now—despite being\noutnumbered, derided and widely written off—Orso had joined their ranks.\nThe man the pamphlets once dubbed the Prince of Prostitutes had emerged,\nlike a splendid butterfly from a putrid chrysalis, as the new Casamir! Life\ntakes strange turns, all right. The lives of kings especially.\n“You damn well should feel pleased with yourself, Your Majesty,”\nfrothed Lord Marshal Rucksted, and few men knew more about feeling\npleased with themselves than he. “You out-thought your enemies off the\nbattlefield, out-fought ’em on it and took the worst traitor of the lot\nprisoner!” And he stole a self-satisfied glance over his shoulder.\nLeo dan Brock, that hero who a few days ago had seemed too big a man\nfor the world to hold, was now contained in a miserable wagon with barred\nwindows, bumping along in Orso’s wake. But then there was less of him to\ncontain than there used to be. His ruined leg had been buried on the\nbattlefield alongside his ruined reputation.\n“You won, Your Majesty,” piped up Bremer dan Gorst, then snapped his\nmouth shut, frowning off towards the approaching towers and chimneys of\nAdua.\n“I did, didn’t I.” An unforced smile was creeping across Orso’s face, all\nby itself. He could hardly remember the last time that happened. “The\nYoung Lion, beaten bloody by the Young Lamb.” His clothes just seemed to\nfit him better than they had before the battle. He rubbed at his jaw, left\nunshaven for a few days in all the excitement. “Should I grow a beard?”\nHildi pushed back her oversized cap to doubtfully assess his stubble.\n“Can you grow a beard?”\n“It’s true I’ve often failed in the past. But one could say that about a\ngreat many things, Hildi. The future looks a different sort of place!”\nFor perhaps the first time in his life he was eager to find out what the\nfuture might hold—even to grapple with the bastard and force it into the\nshapes he desired—so he had left Lord Marshal Forest bellowing the battle-\nmauled Crown Prince’s Division back into order and ridden ahead for Adua"

        "text": "shapes he desired—so he had left Lord Marshal Forest bellowing the battle-\nmauled Crown Prince’s Division back into order and ridden ahead for Adua\nwith a hundred mounted men. He needed to get to the capital and set the\nship of state on course. With the rebels crushed, he could finally embark on\nhis grand tour of the Union and greet his subjects as a royal winner. He\ncould find out what he could do for them, how he could make things better.\nHe wondered fondly what name the adoring crowds would roar at him.\nOrso the Steadfast? Orso the Resolute? Orso the Dauntless, the Stone Wall\nof Stoffenbeck?\nHe sat back, rocked gently by the saddle, and took a deep breath of the\ncrisp autumn air. Since a northerly breeze was carrying the vapours of Adua\nout to sea, he didn’t even need to cough afterwards.\n“I finally understand what people mean when they say they feel like a\nking.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t worry,” said Tunny. “I’m sure you’ll feel baffled and\nhelpless again before you know it.”\n“Doubtless.” Orso could not help glancing towards the rear of the\ncolumn yet again. The wounded Lord Governor of Angland was not their\nonly significant captive. Behind the Young Lion’s prison wagon rattled the\nheavily guarded carriage containing his heavily pregnant wife. Was that\nSavine’s pale hand gripping the windowsill? The mere thought of her name\nmade Orso wince. When the only woman he had ever loved married another\nman, then betrayed him, he had fondly imagined he could feel no worse.\nThen he learned she was his half-sister.\nThe smell of the haphazard slums outside the walls of Adua hardly\nreduced his sudden nausea. He had pictured smiling commoners, little\nUnion flags waved by freckled children, showers of perfumed petals from\nbeauties on the balconies. He had always turned his nose up at such\npatriotic guff when it was directed at other victors, but he had been rather\nlooking forward to its being directed at him. Instead, ragged figures\nfrowned from the shadows. A harlot chewing a chicken leg laughed from a\nmisshapen window. One ill-favoured beggar very noticeably spat into the\nroad as Orso trotted past.\n“There will always be malcontents, Your Majesty,” murmured Yoru\nSulfur. “Only ask my master. No one ever thanks him for his pains.”\n“Mmmm.” Though as far as Orso could recall, Bayaz was always treated\nwith the heights of servile respect. “What’s his solution?”\n“To ignore them.” Sulfur considered the slum-dwellers without emotion.\n“Like ants.”\n“Right. Don’t let them spoil the mood.” But it was a little late for that.\nThe wind seemed to have turned chilly, and Orso was developing that\nfamiliar worried prickling at the back of his neck.\nThe wagon grew even gloomier. Its clattering wheels began to echo.\nBeyond the barred window Leo saw cut stone rush past, knew they must be\nriding through one of Adua’s gates. He’d dreamed of entering the capital at\nthe head of a triumphant parade. Instead he came locked in a prison wagon\nstinking of stale straw, wounds and shame."

Instead he came locked in a prison wagon\nstinking of stale straw, wounds and shame.\nThe floor jolted, sent a throb of agony through the stump of his leg,\nsqueezed tears from his raw eyes. What a fucking fool he’d been. The\nadvantages he’d tossed away. The chances he’d let slip past. The traps he’d\nblundered into.\nHe should’ve told that treacherous coward Isher to fuck himself the\nmoment his prattle tilted towards rebellion. Or better yet, gone straight to\nSavine’s father and spilled the whole story to Old Sticks. Then he’d still\nhave been the Union’s most celebrated hero. The champion who beat the\nGreat Wolf! Not the dunce who lost to the Young Lamb.\nHe should’ve swallowed his pride with King Jappo. Flattered and flirted\nand played the diplomat, offered Westport with a giggle, swapped that\nworthless offcut of Union territory for all the rest and landed in Midderland\nwith Styrian troops behind him.\nHe should’ve brought his mother. The thought of her begging on the\ndocks made him want to rip his hair out. She’d have pressed that shambles\non the beach into order, taken one calm glance at the maps and set the men\nflowing southwards, got to Stoffenbeck first and forced the enemy into a\nlosing battle.\nHe should’ve sent his reply to Orso’s dinner invitation on the end of a\nlance, attacked with every man before sunset and swept the lying bastard\nfrom the high ground, torn up his reinforcements as they arrived.\nEven as Leo’s left wing misfired and his right wing crumbled, he\ncould’ve called off that final charge. At least he’d still have Antaup and Jin.\nAt least he’d still have his leg and his arm. Perhaps Savine could’ve teased\nout some deal. She was the king’s ex-lover, after all. From what Leo had\nseen at his own execution, likely his current one, too. He couldn’t even\nblame her. She’d saved his life, hadn’t she? Whatever his life was worth\nnow.\nHe was a prisoner. A traitor. A cripple.\nThe wagon had slowed to a juddering crawl. He heard voices up ahead,\nchanting, ranting. King Orso’s loyal subjects, come out to cheer his victory?\nBut it sounded nothing like a celebration.\nThe training circle had been Leo’s dance floor. Now it was an ordeal just\nto straighten the leg he still had, so he could grasp the bars of the window\nwith his good hand and drag himself up. By the time he felt the chill breeze\non his face and squinted out into a street murky with foundry smoke, the\nwagon had shuddered to a halt.\nStrange details jumped at him. Shop shutters smashed, broken doors\nhanging from hinges, rubbish scattered across the road. He thought a heap\nof rags in a doorway might be a sleeping tramp. Then, with a creeping\nworry that made him forget his own pain for a moment, he started to think it\nmight be a corpse.\n“By the dead,” he whispered. A warehouse had been burned out, its"

A warehouse had been burned out, its\ncharred rafters like the ribs of a picked-over carcass. A slogan was daubed\nacross its blackened front in letters three strides high.\nThe Time is Now.\nHe pressed his face to the bars, straining to see further up the street.\nBeyond the officers, retainers and Knights of the Body on their nervous\nhorses, figures were crowded outside a spike-topped wall, banners bobbing\nover the mob like standards over a regiment. Fair pay for fair work and\nDown with the Closed Council and Rise up! They were already drifting\ntowards the king’s column, droning with sullen anger, booing and jeering.\nWere these… Breakers?\n“By the dead,” he whispered again. He saw people down a side street,\ntoo. Men with labourer’s clothes and clenched fists. Running figures,\nchasing someone. Falling on them, kicking and punching.\nA bellow came from up ahead. Rucksted, maybe. “Clear the way, in the\nname of His Majesty!”\n“You clear the fucking way!” snarled a man with a thick beard and no\nneck at all. People were filtering in from the alleys, creating a troubling\nsense of the column being surrounded.\n“It’s the Young Lion!” someone barked, and Leo heard half-hearted\ncheers. His good leg, which a few days ago had been his bad leg, was on\nfire, but he clung to the bars as people crowded towards the wagon, hands\nreaching for him.\n“The Young Lion!”\nSavine watched from the carriage window, utterly helpless, one hand\nclutching her bloated mass of belly, the other gripping Zuri’s, while ruffians\ncrowded around Leo’s prison wagon like pigs around a trough. She hardly\nknew whether they were trying to rescue or murder him. Probably they had\nno idea, either.\nShe realised she could not remember how it felt, not to be scared.\nIt had probably begun as a strike. Savine knew every manufactory in\nAdua, and this was Foss dan Harber’s paper mill, a concern she had twice\ndeclined to invest in. The profits were tempting, but Harber’s reputation\nstank. He was the kind of brutal, exploitative owner who made it hard for\neveryone else to properly exploit their workers. It had probably begun as a\nstrike then turned, as strikes quickly can, into something altogether uglier.\n“Get back!” snapped a young officer, lashing at the crowd with his\nriding crop. A mounted guard dragged one man away by the shoulder, then\nclubbed another across the scalp with his shield. Blood showed bright as he\nfell.\n“Oh,” said Savine, her eyes going wide.\nSomeone hit the officer with a stick and rocked him in his saddle.\n“Wait!” She thought it might have been Orso’s voice. “Wait!” But it\nmade no difference. The High King of the Union was suddenly as\npowerless as she was. People pressed in on every side, a sea of furious\nfaces, shaken placards and clenched fists. The clamour made her think of\nValbeck, of the uprising, but the terrible present was bad enough without\nreaching for the terrible past."

The clamour made her think of\nValbeck, of the uprising, but the terrible present was bad enough without\nreaching for the terrible past.\nMore soldiers rode in. A cry cut off as someone was trampled.\n“Bastards!”\nA faint ring as a blade was drawn.\n“Protect the king!” came Gorst’s shriek.\nA soldier struck out with the pommel of his sword, then with the flat,\nknocking a man’s cap off and sending him tumbling to the cobbles. One of\nthe other Knights of the Body was less forbearing. A flicker of steel, a high-\npitched scream. This time, Savine saw the sword fall and open a yawning\nwound in a man’s shoulder. Something smashed against the side of the\ncarriage and she flinched.\n“God help us,” muttered Zuri.\nSavine stared at her. “Does He ever?”\n“I keep hoping.” Zuri slid a protective arm around Savine’s shoulders.\n“Come away from the window—”\n“And go where?” whispered Savine, shrinking back against her.\nBeyond the glass it was utter chaos. A mounted soldier and a red-faced\nwoman wrestled over one end of a banner that read All Equal, the other\ntangled up in a mass of arms and faces. A Knight of the Body was dragged\nfrom his horse, lost in the crowd like a sailor in a stormy sea. They were\neverywhere, forcing their way between the horses, shoving, clutching,\nscreeching.\nA crash as the window shattered and Savine jerked back, broken glass\nshowering in.\n“Traitor!” someone screamed. At her? At Leo? An arm hooked through,\na dirty hand fishing for the catch. Savine smashed at it clumsily with the\nside of her fist, not sure whether it would be worse to be dragged from the\ncarriage by the mob or dragged to the House of Questions by the\nInquisition.\nZuri was just getting up when there was a flicker outside. Something\npattered Savine’s cheek. Red spots on her dress. The arm slithered away.\nFire bloomed suddenly beyond the window and she hunched over, both\narms around her belly as pain stabbed through her guts.\n“God help us,” she mouthed. Would she give birth there, on the glass-\nlittered floor of a carriage in the middle of a riot?\n“You fuckers!” A big man in an apron had caught the reins of that\nblonde girl Orso kept as a servant, the one who used to carry messages\nbetween him and Savine, a thousand years ago. He clutched at her leg while\nshe kicked back, spitting and snarling. Savine saw Orso wrench his horse\naround and start punching the man about his balding scalp. He grabbed at\nOrso, trying to pull him down from his saddle. “You—”\nHis skull burst open, spraying red. Savine stared. She could have sworn\nthat man Sulfur had slapped him with an open hand and torn his head half-\noff.\nGorst spurred past, teeth bared as he hacked savagely on one side then\nthe other, bodies dropping. “The king!” he squealed. “The king!”\n“The Agriont!” someone bellowed. “Stop for nothing!”"

Savine would have been thrown from her\nseat had Zuri not shot out an arm. She clung desperately to the empty\nwindow frame, bit her lip at another flash of pain in her swollen stomach.\nShe saw people scatter. Heard shrieks of terror. A body was knocked\nreeling by the corner of the carriage, clattered against the door and went\ndown under the milling hooves of a knight herald. There were strands of\nblonde hair caught in the broken window.\nWheels bounced over a trampled sign, whirred over pamphlets stuck\nflapping to the damp road. The prison wagon clattered ahead, striking\nsparks from the cobbles, maddened horses all around, whipping manes and\nflapping harness. Something clonked against the other side of the carriage,\nthen they were past, leaving Harber’s mill and its rioting workers behind.\nCold wind rushed through the broken window, Savine’s heart\nhammering, her hand frozen on the sill but her face burning as if she’d been\nslapped. How could Zuri be so calm beside her? Her face fixed, her arm so\nfirm around Savine. The baby squirmed as the carriage rocked and jolted. It\nwas alive, at least. It was alive.\nOutside the window she saw Lord Chamberlain Hoff clinging to his\nreins, chain of office tangled tight around his red throat. She saw the king’s\nold, grey-haired standard-bearer gripping his flagstaff, the sun of the Union\nstreaming overhead, an oily smear across the cloth of gold.\nStreets whipped by, so familiar, so unfamiliar. This city had been hers.\nNo one more admired. No one more envied. No one more hated, which she\nhad always taken as the only honest compliment. Buildings flashed past.\nBuildings she knew. Buildings she owned, even. Or had owned.\nIt would all be forfeit now.\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. She could not remember how it felt, not to\nbe scared.\nShe remembered taking Leo’s ring, with the Agriont and all its little\npeople spread out beneath them. The future had been theirs. How could they\nhave so totally destroyed themselves? His recklessness or her ambition\nalone could not have done it. But like two chemicals which, apart, are\nmerely mildly poisonous, combined they had produced an unstable\nexplosive which had blown both their lives and thousands of others to hell.\nThe cut beneath the bandages on her shaved head itched endlessly.\nPerhaps it would have been kinder if the chunk of metal that scarred her had\nflown just a little lower and split her skull instead of just her scalp.\n“Slow!” Gorst’s squealing voice. “Slow!” They were crossing one of the\nbridges into the Agriont, the great walls looming ahead. Once they had\nmade her feel safe as a parent’s embrace. Now they looked like prison\nwalls. Now they were prison walls. Her neck was not out of the noose yet,\nand nor was Leo’s.\nAfter they brought him down from the gallows, she had changed the\ndressing on his leg.

        "text": "After they brought him down from the gallows, she had changed the\ndressing on his leg. It seemed the sort of thing a wife should do for her\nwounded husband. Especially when his wounds were in large part her\ndoing. She had thought she could be strong. She was notorious for cool\nruthlessness, after all. But as she unwound the bandages in an obscene\nstriptease they had gone from spotted brown, to pink, to black. The stump\nrevealed. The dressmaker’s nightmare of clumsy stitching. The weeping\npurple-redness of the jagged seams. The terrible, bizarre, fake-looking\nabsence of the limb. The cheap spirits and butcher-shop stench of it. She\nhad covered her mouth. Not a word said, but she had looked into his face\nand seen her own horror reflected, then the guards had come to take her\naway, and she had been grateful. The memory made her sick. Sick with\nguilt. Sick with disgust. Sick with guilt at her disgust.\nShe realised she was shivering, and Zuri squeezed her hand. “It will be\nall right,” she said.\nSavine stared into her dark eyes and whispered, “How?”\nThe carriage juddered to a halt. When an officer opened the door, glass\ntinkled from the broken window. It took a moment to make her fingers\nunclench. She had to peel them away, like the death grip of a corpse. She\nwobbled down in a daze, thinking she would piss herself with every\nmovement. Had she pissed herself already?\nThe Square of Marshals. She had wheeled her father across this expanse\nof flagstones once a month, laughing at the misfortunes of others. She had\nattended Open Council at the Lords’ Round, sifting the blather for\nopportunities. She had discussed business with associates, who to raise up,\nwho to grind down, who to pay off and who would pay the price. She knew\nthe landmarks above the soot-streaked rooftops—the slender finger of the\nTower of Chains, the looming outline of the House of the Maker. But they\nbelonged to a different world. A different life. All around her men goggled\nin disbelief. Men with faces grazed, fine uniforms torn, drawn swords\nstained red.\n“Your hand,” said Zuri.\nIt was smeared with blood. Savine turned it stupidly over and saw a\nshard of glass stuck into her palm, where she had been gripping the window\nframe. She hardly even felt it.\nShe glanced up, and her eyes met Orso’s. He looked pale and rattled, his\ngolden circlet skewed, his mouth slightly open as if to speak, hers slightly\nopen as if to reply. But for a while they said nothing.\n“Find Lady Savine and her husband some quarters,” he croaked,\neventually. “In the House of Questions.”\nSavine swallowed as she watched him walk away.\nShe could not remember how it felt, not to be terrified.\nOrso strode across the Square of Marshals in the rough direction of the\npalace, fists clenched. The sight of her still somehow took his breath away.\nBut there were more pressing concerns than the smouldering ruins of his\nlove life.\nThat his homecoming triumph had degenerated from anticlimax into\nbloodbath, for instance."

        "text": "But there were more pressing concerns than the smouldering ruins of his\nlove life.\nThat his homecoming triumph had degenerated from anticlimax into\nbloodbath, for instance.\n“They hate me,” he muttered. He was used to being despised, of course.\nScurrilous pamphlets, slanderous rumours, sneers in the Open Council. But\nfor a king to be politely loathed behind his back was the normal state of\nsociety. For a king to be physically manhandled by a crowd was a short step\nfrom outright revolt. The second in a month. Adua—the centre of the world,\nthe zenith of civilisation, that beacon of progress and prosperity—was\nplunged into lawless chaos.\nIt was quite the shocking disappointment. Like popping some delightful\nsweetmeat into one’s mouth and, upon chewing, discovering it was actually\na piece of shit. But that was the experience of being a monarch. One\nshocking mouthful of shit after another.\nLord Hoff was wheezing away as he struggled to keep up. “There are\nalways… complaints—”\n“They fucking hate me! Did you hear them cheering for the Young\nLion? When did that entitled bastard become some man of the people?”\nBefore Orso’s victory, everyone had considered him a contemptible coward\nand Brock a magnificent hero. By rights, surely, their positions should have\nbeen reversed. Yet now he was considered a contemptible tyrant, while they\ncheered the Young Lion as a pitiable underdog. If Brock had wanked in the\nstreet it would have been to thunderous approval from the public.\n“Bloody traitors!” snarled Rucksted, grinding gloved fist into gloved\npalm. “We should hang the bloody lot of them!”\n“You can’t hang everyone,” said Orso.\n“With your permission, I’ll head back into the city and make a damn\ngood start at it.”\n“I fear our mistake has been too many hangings rather than too few—”\n“Your Majesty!” A knight herald of horrifying height was waiting on the\nKingsway beneath the statue of Harod the Great, winged helmet under one\narm. “Your Closed Council has urgently requested your attendance in the\nWhite Chamber.” He fell in step beside Orso, having to shorten his stride\nconsiderably. “Might I congratulate you on your famous victory at\nStoffenbeck?”\n“That feels a very long time ago,” said Orso, stalking on. He was\nconcerned that if he did not keep moving, he might collapse like a child’s\ntower of bricks. “I have already received the congratulations of a\nconsiderable crowd of rioters on the Kingsway.” And he frowned up at the\nlooming statue of Casamir the Steadfast, wondering whether he had ever\nbeen obliged to flee from his own people through the streets of his own\ncapital. The history books made no mention of it.\n“Things have been… unsettled in your absence, Your Majesty.” Orso did\nnot care for the way he said unsettled. It felt like a euphemism for\nsomething much worse. “There was a disturbance shortly after you left.\nOver the rising price of bread. With the rebellion, and the poor weather, not\nenough flour has been getting into the city. A crowd of women forced their\nway into some bakers’ shops. They beat the owners. One they declared a\nspeculator, and… murdered.”"

One they declared a\nspeculator, and… murdered.”\n“This is troubling,” said Sulfur, with towering understatement. Orso\nnoticed he was carefully wiping blood from the side of his hand with a\nhandkerchief. Of the slight smirk he had managed to maintain through the\nexecution of two hundred people outside Valbeck, there was no sign at all.\n“The next day there was a strike at the Hill Street Foundry. The day after\nthere were three more. Some guardsmen refused to patrol. Others clashed\nwith the rioters.” The knight herald worked his mouth unhappily. “Several\ndeaths.”\nOrso’s father was last in the procession of immortalised monarchs,\ngazing out over the deserted park with an expression of decisive command\nhe had never worn in life. Opposite him, on a slightly less monumental\nscale, loomed that famous war hero Lord Marshal West, that noted torturer\nArch Lector Glokta, and the First of the Magi himself, glaring down with\nwrinkled lip as though all men were complaining ants to him indeed. Orso\nhad often wondered which retainers would end up opposite his own statue,\nin future years. This was the first time he had ever wondered if he would get\na statue at all.\n“There’ll be order now!” Hoff struggled to lift the funereal mood.\n“You’ll see!”\n“I hope so, Your Grace,” said the knight herald. “Groups of Breakers\nhave taken over some of the manufactories. They march openly in the Three\nFarms, calling for… well, the resignation of His Majesty’s Closed\nCouncil.” Orso did not care for the way he said resignation. It felt like a\neuphemism for something considerably more final. “People are stirred up,\nYour Majesty. People want blood.”\n“My blood?” muttered Orso, trying and failing to loosen his collar.\n“Well…” The knight herald gave a rather limp parting salute. “Blood,\nanyway. I’m not sure they care whose.”\nIt was a sadly reduced Closed Council that struggled to its aged feet as\nOrso clattered into the White Chamber. Lord Marshal Forest had been left\nbehind in Stoffenbeck with the shattered remnants of the army. Arch Lector\nPike was terrifying the ever-restless denizens of Valbeck into renewed\nsubmission. A replacement had yet to be found for High Justice Bruckel\nafter his head was split in half during a previous attempt on Orso’s life.\nBayaz’s chair at the foot of the table was—as it had been for the great\nmajority of the last few centuries—empty. And the surveyor general, one\ncould only assume, was once again out with his bladder.\nLord Chancellor Gorodets’ voice was rather shrill. “Might I congratulate\nYour Majesty on your famous victory at Stoffenbeck—”\n“Put it out of your mind.” Orso flung himself into his uncomfortable\nchair. “I have.”\n“We were set upon!” Rucksted stormed to his seat with spurs jingling.\n“The royal party!”\n“Rioters in the bloody streets of Adua!” wheezed Hoff as he sagged\ndown and began to dab his sweat-beaded forehead with the sleeve of his\nrobe."

Gorst’s\nhandiwork had left him speckled all over. “Any news from Arch Lector\nPike?”\n“You haven’t heard?” Gorodets had graduated from his usual habit of\nfluffing and combing his long beard to wringing it between clawing fingers.\n“Valbeck has fallen to an uprising!”\nThe glug of Orso swallowing echoed audibly from the stark white walls.\n“Fallen?”\n“Again?” squealed Hoff.\n“No word from His Eminence,” said Gorodets. “We fear he may be a\ncaptive of the Breakers.”\n“Captive?” muttered Orso. The room was feeling even more intolerably\ncramped than usual.\n“News of turmoil pours in from all across Midderland!” blurted the high\nconsul, warbling on the edge of panic. “We have lost contact with the\nauthorities in Keln. Troubling news from Holsthorm. Robbings. Lynchings.\nPurges.”\n“Purges?” breathed Orso. It appeared he was doomed to endlessly repeat\nsingle words in a tone of horrified upset.\n“There are rumours of bands of Breakers ravaging the countryside!”\n“Huge bands,” said Lord Admiral Krepskin. “Converging on the capital!\nBastards have taken to calling ’emselves the People’s Army.”\n“A bloody plague of treason,” breathed Hoff, eyes fixed on the empty\nchair at the bottom of the table. “Can we get a message to Lord Bayaz?”\nOrso dumbly shook his head. “Not soon enough to make a difference.”\nHe imagined the First of the Magi would choose to keep a discreet distance\nin any case, while calculating how he could profit from the aftermath.\n“We have done all we can to keep the news from becoming public—”\n“To prevent panic, you understand, Your Majesty, but—”\n“They may be at our gates within days!”\nThere was a long silence. The sense of triumph as Orso approached the\ncity was a dimly remembered dream.\nIf there was a polar opposite to feeling like a king, he had discovered it.\nChange\n“Y\nou must confess,” said Pike. “It’s impressive.”\n“I must,” said Vick. And she wasn’t easily impressed.\nThe People’s Army might have lacked discipline, equipment and\nsupplies, but there was no arguing with its scale. It stretched off, clogging\nthe road in the valley bottom and straggling up the soggy slopes on both\nsides, until it was lost in the drizzly distance.\nThere might’ve been ten thousand when they set out from Valbeck.

A largely good-natured riot.\nVick had half-expected, half-hoped that they’d melt away as they\nslogged across the muddy country in worsening weather, but their numbers\nhad quickly swelled. In came labourers, smallholders and farmers with\nscythes and pitchforks—which caused some concern—and with flour and\nhams—which caused some celebration. In came gangs of beggars and\ngangs of orphans. In came soldiers, deserted from who knew what lost\nbattalions. In came dealers, whores and demagogues, dishing up husk, fucks\nand political theory in tents by roadways trampled into bogs.\nThere was no arguing with its enthusiasm, either. At night, the fires went\non for miles, folk drawing dew-dusted blankets tight against the autumn\nchill, blurting out their smoking dreams and desires, talking bright-eyed of\nchange. The Great Change, come at last.\nVick had no idea how far back that sodden column went now. No idea\nhow many Breakers and Burners were part of it. Miles of men, women and\nchildren, slogging through the mud towards Adua. Towards a better\ntomorrow. Vick had her doubts, of course. But all that hope. A flood of the\ndamn stuff. No matter how jaded you were, you couldn’t help but be moved\nby it. Or maybe she wasn’t quite so jaded as she’d always told herself.\nVick had learned in the camps that you stand with the winners. It had\nbeen her golden rule ever since. But in the camps, and in all the years since\nshe left them, she’d never doubted who the winners were. The men in\ncharge. The Inquisition, the Closed Council, the Arch Lector. Looking down\non that unruly mass of humanity, fixed on changing the world, she wasn’t so\nsure who the winners would be. She wasn’t sure what the sides were, even.\nIf Leo dan Brock had beaten Orso, there might have been a new king, new\nfaces in the Closed Council, new arses in the big chairs, but things\nwould’ve stayed much the same. If this lot beat Orso, who knew what came\nnext? All the old certainties were crumbling, and she was left wondering\nwhether they’d ever been certainties at all, or just fools’ assumptions.\nIn Starikland, during the rebellion, Vick had felt an earthquake. The\nground had trembled, books had dropped from shelves, a chimney had\nfallen into the street outside. Not for long, but for long enough, she’d felt\nthe terror of knowing all she’d counted on as solid could in a moment shake\nitself apart.\nNow she had that feeling again, but she knew the quake had only just\nbegun. How long would the world shiver? What would still be standing\nwhen it stopped?\n“I notice you are still with us, Sister Victarine.” Pike clicked his tongue\nand nudged his mount down the slope, towards the head of the bedraggled\ncolumn.\nVick had a strong instinct not to follow. But she did. “I’m still with\nyou.”\n“So you are a convert to our cause?”"

But she did. “I’m still with\nyou.”\n“So you are a convert to our cause?”\nThere was a hopeful piece of her that wanted to believe this could be\nSibalt’s dreams of a better world coming true and was desperate to see it\nhappen. There was a nervous piece of her that smelled blood coming and\nwanted to cut out that night and run for the Far Country. There was a\ncalculating piece that reckoned the only way to control a mad horse is from\nthe saddle, and the danger of keeping your grip might be less than the\ndanger of letting go.\nShe looked sideways at Pike. In truth, she was still trying to work out\nwhat their cause really was. In truth, she reckoned there was a different\ncause for every one of those little dots in the People’s Army. But this was\nno time for the truth. When is? “I’d be a fool to say I’m not at all\nconvinced.”\n“And if you said you were entirely convinced, I would be a fool to\nbelieve you.”\n“Since neither of us is a fool… let’s just say maybe.”\n“Oh, we are all fools. But I enjoy a good maybe.” Pike showed no sign\nof enjoyment or of anything else. “Absolutes are never to be trusted.”\nVick doubted the two leaders of the Great Change riding towards them\nacross the grassy slope would have agreed.\n“Brother Pike!” called Risinau, with a cheery wave of one plump hand.\n“Sister Victarine!”\nRisinau worried Vick. The one-time Superior of Valbeck was considered\na deep thinker, but far as she could tell he was an idiot’s notion of a genius,\nhis ideas a maze with nothing at the centre, heavy on the righteous society\nto come but light as air on the route they’d take to get there. The pockets of\nhis jacket bulged with papers. Scrawled theories, manifestos,\nproclamations. Speeches he whined out to eager throngs whenever the\nPeople’s Army halted. Vick didn’t like the way the crowd greeted his\nflowery appeals for reason with shaken weapons and howls of approving\nfury. She never saw more damage done than by folk acting on high\nprinciple.\nBut Judge worried Vick a lot more. She wore a rusty old breastplate\nrattling with stolen chains over a ball gown crusted with chips of cracked\ncrystal, but she sat her saddle astride not aside so the flounce of tattered\npetticoats was gathered up around her thighs, her muddy bare feet shoved\ninto battered cavalry stirrups. Her face was like a bag of daggers, lean jaw\nangrily clenched, black eyes angrily narrowed, her usually flaming crest of\nhair turned brown by the rain and plastered wetly down one side of her\nskull. Principles only interested her as an excuse for mayhem. When her\nBurners had taken the courthouse in Valbeck, her jury had found no one\ninnocent and the one sentence she’d given was death.\nIf Risinau was forever gazing up, no thought for the wreckage he was\nstepping through, Judge was glaring down, trying to trample everything she\ncould. And Pike? There were no clues on the ex-Arch Lector’s burned mask\nof a face. Who could say what Brother Pike was after?"

Who could say what Brother Pike was after?\nVick nodded towards grime-streaked Adua, its pall of smoke inching\nirresistibly closer. “What happens when we get there?”\n“Change,” said Risinau, smug as a rooster. “The Great Change.”\n“From what, to what?”\n“I am not blessed with the Long Eye, Sister Victarine.” Risinau giggled\nat the thought. “From the pupa alone it is hard to know what kind of\nbutterfly might emerge to greet the dawn. But change.” He wagged a thick\nfinger at her. “Of that you can be sure! A new Union, built from high\nideals!”\n“The world doesn’t need changing,” grunted Judge, black eyes fixed on\nthe capital. “It needs burning.”\nVick wouldn’t have trusted either one of them to herd pigs, let alone to\nherd the dreams of millions into a new future. She kept her face blank, of\ncourse, but Pike must have caught some hint of her feelings. “You appear to\nhave doubts.”\n“I’ve never seen the world change quickly,” said Vick. “If I’ve seen it\nchange at all.”\n“I begin to think Sibalt liked you so because you were his opposite.”\nRisinau laid a playful hand on her shoulder. “You are such a cynic, Sister!”\nVick shrugged him off. “I think I’ve earned it.”\n“After a childhood stolen in the camps,” said Pike, “and a career of\nmaking friends to betray for Arch Lector Glokta, how could you be\notherwise? But one can be too cynical. You will see.”\nVick had to admit she’d been expecting the Great Change to collapse\nlong before now. For Judge and Risinau to move past bickering to tearing\neach other apart, for the fragile coalition of Breakers and Burners,\nmoderates and extremists, to shred into factions, for the resolve of the\nPeople’s Army to dissolve in the wet weather. Or, for that matter, for Lord\nMarshal Rucksted’s cavalry to crest every hill she saw and carve the ragged\nmultitude to pieces.\nBut Risinau and Judge continued to tolerate each other and the King’s\nOwn made no appearance. Even now, as the rain slacked off and they\nmarched into the ill-planned, ill-drained, ill-smelling maze of shacks\noutside the walls of the capital, water spattering from the broken gutters and\ninto the muddy lanes below. Maybe Orso’s forces had been fought out\nagainst Leo dan Brock. Maybe there were other uprisings to deal with.\nMaybe these strange times had stretched their loyalties in so many\ndirections they hardly knew who to fight for any more. Vick knew how they\nfelt as the sun showed through, and she caught her first glimpse of the gates\nof Adua.\nFor a moment, she wondered whether Tallow was in the city. Fretted that\nhe might be in danger. Then she realised how foolish it was to worry over\none person in the midst of all this. What could she do for him, anyway?\nWhat could anyone do for anyone?"

Deploy our cannon and, er—”\nJudge gave a great snort of disgust, dug her bare heels into her horse’s\nflanks and rode forwards.\n“One cannot fault her courage,” said Pike.\n“Just her sanity.” Vick was rather hoping for a shower of arrows, but it\nnever came. Judge trotted on towards the walls, chin scornfully raised, in\neerie silence.\n“You inside!” she screamed, reining in before the gate. “Soldiers of the\nUnion! Men of Adua!” She stood in her stirrups, pointing back at the horde\ncrawling up the soggy road towards the capital. “This is the People’s Army,\nand it’s come to set the people free! We only need to know one thing from\nyou lot!” She held high one clawing finger. “Are you with the people… or\nagainst ’em?”\nHer horse shied, and she ripped at the reins and dragged it around in a\ntight circle, that finger still extended, while the thunder of thousands upon\nthousands of tramping feet grew steadily louder.\nVick flinched at an echoing clatter from behind the gates, then a slit of\nlight showed between the two doors and, with a creaking of hinges in need\nof oil, they swung slowly open.\nA soldier leaned from the parapet, grinning madly and waving his hat.\n“We’re with ’em!” he bellowed. “The Great Change!”\nJudge tossed her head, and dragged her horse from the road, and with an\nimpatient flick of her arm beckoned the People’s Army forwards.\n“Fuck the king!” screeched that lone soldier, to a wave of laughter from\nthe oncoming Breakers, and he took his life in his hands by shinning up the\nwet flagpole to tear down the standard above the gatehouse.\nThe High King’s banner, which had flown over the walls of Adua for\ncenturies. The golden sun of the Union, given to Harod the Great as his\nemblem by Bayaz himself. The flag folk had knelt to, prayed to, sworn their\nloyalty to… came fluttering down to lie in the puddle-pocked road before\nthe gate.\n“The world can change, Sister Victarine.” Pike raised one hairless brow\nat Vick. “Just watch.” And he clicked his tongue and rode on towards the\nopen gates.\nSo it was with almost over-heavy symbolism that the People’s Army\nmarched into Adua, trampling the flag of the past into the mud.\nThe Little People\n“T\nhey’re here!” Jakib was so choked with excitement his voice cracked\nand went all warbly. “The Breakers are bloody here!” All the days and\nweeks and months waiting and now he stared wildly around their little\nparlour with his hands opening and closing, hardly knowing what to do\nfirst.\nPetree didn’t look excited.

The lads had\nwarned him he was marrying a sour woman, but he hadn’t seen it then.\nHe’d always been a hoper. “You’re a hoper,” they’d said. Now every day\nshe seemed more sour. But this was hardly the time to be fretting about his\nmarriage. “They’re bloody here!”\nWhen he grabbed his coat he sent pamphlets scattering off the table.\nWasn’t as if he’d read them. Wasn’t as if he could read, really. But having\n’em felt like a fine step towards freedom. And who needed pamphlets, when\nthe Breakers were come in person?\nHe went to fetch his grandfather’s sword from the hook above the fire.\nHissed a curse that Petree had made him hang it out of reach. Had to go up\non tiptoes to get the damn thing down and near dropped it on his head.\nHe felt bad when he saw her face. Maybe she wasn’t sour so much as\nscared. That’s what the bastards wanted, the Inquisition and the Closed\nCouncil. Everyone scared. He caught her by the shoulder. Tried to shake\nsome of his hope into her. “Price o’ bread’ll go down now,” he said, “you’ll\nsee. Bread for everyone!”\n“You think so?”\n“I know so.”\nShe put her fingertips on the battered scabbard. “Don’t take the sword.\nHaving it might make you try to use it. You don’t know how.”\n“I know how,” he snapped, though they both knew he didn’t, not really,\nand he wrenched it from her hand, twisted it the wrong way up and the rust-\nspotted blade slithered halfway out of the scabbard before he caught it and\nslapped it back in. “A man should be armed, on the day of the Great\nChange! Enough of us have ’em, we won’t need to use ’em.” And before\nshe could voice any more doubts he dashed out, letting the door clatter\nagainst the frame.\nThe streets were bright outside, everything glossy and gleaming and\nseeming new-made after the rain just fallen. People everywhere, somewhere\nbetween a riot and a carnival. People running, people shouting. Some faces\nhe knew. Most were strangers. A woman grabbed him around the neck,\nkissed him on the cheek. A whore stood on some railings, clinging to the\nside of a building with one hand, pulling her dress up with the other to give\nthe crowd an eyeful. “Half price all day!” she screeched.\nHe’d been ready to fight. Ready to charge ranks of royalist spears,\nfreedom and equality as his armour. Petree had not cared for that idea, and\nhonestly, he’d been having some doubts of his own as the day grew closer.\nBut he only saw a few soldiers, and they had smiles on their faces and\njackets hanging open, cheering and jumping and celebrating like everyone\nelse.\nSomeone was singing. Someone was crying. Someone was dancing in\npuddles, spraying everyone. Someone lay in a doorway. Drunk, maybe, then\nJakib saw blood on their face. Maybe he should help? But he was swept\nalong by people running. Couldn’t tell why. Couldn’t tell anything."

Couldn’t tell anything.\nOut onto the Sparway that cut wide through the mills of the Three Farms\ntowards the centre of the city. He saw armed men there—polished armour,\nbrand new and glittering. He froze at the corner, heart in his mouth, sword\nhalf-hidden behind his back, thinking they must be King’s Own. Then he\nsaw their bearded faces, and their swaggering gait, and the banners they\ncarried, roughly stitched with broken chains, and he knew this was the\nPeople’s Army, marching to freedom.\nWorkers were pouring from the manufactories to join the throng and he\npushed through them, laughing and shouting himself hoarse. He clambered\naround a cannon. A bloody cannon wheeled along by grinning dye-women,\ntheir forearms stained strange colours. Folk sang, and embraced, and wept,\nand Jakib wasn’t a shoemaker any more but a fighter for justice, a proud\nbrother of the Breakers, struggling in the great endeavour of the age.\nHe saw a woman at the head of the crowd, on a white horse, wearing a\nsoldier’s breastplate. Judge! Had to be Judge. More beautiful and furious\nand righteous through the blurring tears in his eyes than he’d dared to hope.\nA spirit, she was, an idea made into flesh. A goddess, leading the people to\ntheir destiny.\n“Brothers! Sisters! To the Agriont!” And she pointed up the road\ntowards freedom. “I’ve a fancy to greet His August fucking Majesty!”\nAnd there was another raucous wave of laughter and delight, and down\nan alley Jakib thought he saw some men kicking someone on the ground,\nover and over, and he drew his grandfather’s rusty sword, and lifted it high\nin the air, and joined in with the singing.\n“They’re here,” whispered Grey.\nCaptain Leeb drew his sword. Felt like the right thing to do. “I am\naware, Corporal.” He tried to project an air of confidence. Confidence\ndefines an officer. He remembered his brother telling him so. “I can hear\nthem.”\nJudging by the noise, there was a considerable number of them. A\nconsiderable number, and steadily approaching. It put Leeb in mind of the\ncrowd’s clamour at the Contest. Hundreds of voices raised in delighted\nexcitement. Thousands of voices. But there was a definite edge of madness\nto it. A touch of fury. An occasional punctuation of shattering glass,\nsplintering wood.\nLeeb would have very much liked to run away. He didn’t want anyone’s\nblood on his hands, especially not his own. And he wasn’t without\nsympathy for their cause, up to a point. Freedom and justice and so on, who\ndoesn’t like that stuff, in principle? But he had sworn an oath to the king.\nNot to the king directly, of course, but, you know, he’d sworn it even so.\nHe’d been happy to swear it when things were going well and supposed he\ncouldn’t just unswear it the moment things turned dicey. What kind of an\noath would it be then?\nHis colonel had assured him help was coming. From the King’s Own."

From the King’s Own.\nThen from Westport. Then from Starikland. From ever less likely directions.\nBut no help appeared to have arrived at all.\nLeeb glanced at his men, spread out across the width of the Sparway.\nWhat a flimsy little red line they looked. Perhaps forty flatbowmen, eighty\nspearmen. Half of his company hadn’t come out. Somewhat looser in their\noaths than he was. He’d always thought there was no more admirable\nquality than being a man of your word. Loyalty defines an officer. His father\nhad often told him so. But it was starting to look as if a certain elasticity\ncould be a useful thing.\n“They’re here,” whispered Grey again.\n“I am aware, Corporal.” Leeb’s mouth turned very dry as the murk from\nthe foundry down the street was thinned out by the breeze. “I can see\nthem.”\nMore of them, indeed, and more. Many looked like ordinary citizens,\nwomen and children among them, brandishing chair-legs and hammers and\nknives and spears made from mops. Others looked like professionals,\narmour and bright weapons glinting as the sun peeped through. Leeb’s jaw\nslowly dropped as he began to appreciate the sheer number of them.\nPlainly the Closed Council’s increasingly shrill proclamations, curfews,\nthreats, examples had not achieved the desired effect. Quite the reverse.\n“By the Fates,” someone muttered.\n“Steady,” said Leeb, but it came out a squeak that couldn’t have steadied\nanyone. It might have unsteadied those already steady, indeed. It was\npainfully obvious that his brittle little line had no chance of stopping that\nboiling tide. No chance at all.\nWhen they saw Leeb and his soldiers they wobbled to a halt, bunching\nup uncertainly, chants and cheers dying on their lips. There was an intensely\nawkward silence, and an inappropriate memory floated up from the depths\nof Leeb’s mind. The intensely awkward silence after he, drunk, had tried to\nkiss his cousin Sithrin at that dance and she jerked away in horror so he\nended up sort of kissing her ear. This silence was like that one. But a great\ndeal more terrifying.\nWhat to do? By the Fates, what to do? Let them through? Join them?\nFight them? Run and never stop? There were no good ideas. Leeb’s lower\nlip twitched stupidly, but no sound emerged. Even a least-bad idea was\nbeyond him. Decisiveness defines an officer, but he hadn’t been trained for\nthis. They don’t train you for the world suddenly coming unravelled.\nAnd now a rider pushed through to the front of the throng. A woman,\nwith a tangle of damp red hair and a furious sneer. It was as if her rage was\nan infection, spreading instantly through the crowd. Faces twisted, weapons\nlifted, screams and cries and taunts burst forth, and suddenly Leeb had no\nchoice at all.\n“Raise bows!” he spluttered. Almost as if, running out of time to think of"

Almost as if, running out of time to think of\na better idea, he was left only with this self-evidently terrible one. His men\nglanced at each other, stirred uncomfortably.\n“Raise bows!” roared Corporal Grey, veins bulging from his thick neck.\nAt the same time, he looked at Leeb with a vaguely desperate expression.\nThe pilot of a foundering vessel, perhaps, looking to his captain, silently\nasking if they really did intend to go down with the ship. Perhaps that’s why\ncaptains do go down with their ships. No better ideas.\n“Shoot!” squeaked Leeb, chopping downwards with his sword.\nHe wasn’t sure how many actually shot. Less than half. Afraid to shoot\nat so many? Unwilling to shoot at men who might have been their fathers,\nbrothers, sons? Women who might have been their mothers, sisters,\ndaughters? A couple shot high, on purpose or in haste. There was a scream.\nDid two or three fall in the front rank of that seething mob? It made not the\nslightest difference. How could it?\nThe terrifying she-devil at the front stabbed towards Leeb with a\nclawing finger.\n“Kill those fuckers!”\nAnd they charged in their hundreds.\nLeeb was a reasonably brave man, a reasonably honourable man, a\nreasonable monarchist who took his oath to his king very seriously. But\nLeeb was not a fool. He turned and ran with his men. It was not a company\nany more, but a squealing, jostling, whimpering herd of pigs.\nSomeone shoved him and he fell, rolled. He thought it might’ve been\nCorporal Grey, damn him. They all were scattering now, tossing their\nweapons, and he scrambled towards an alleyway, barging past a surprised-\nlooking beggar and nearly falling again. How could one man keep his oath\nwhen everyone else was breaking theirs, after all? An army very much\nrelied on unity of purpose.\nRun for the Agriont, that was all he could think of. He plunged through\nthe crooked backstreets, his neck prickling with fear, his breath sawing at\nhis chest. Damn weak lungs, he’d been cursed with them all his life. Can\nyou name a lord marshal with weak lungs? his brother used to ask. Lungs\ndefine an officer! Adua’s foul vapours hardly helped. He sagged into a\ndoorway, trying to suppress his cough. He’d dropped his sword somewhere.\nOr had he thrown it away?\n“Bloody hell.” He stared down at his officer’s jacket. Bright red. How\ncould it be redder? The whole purpose was to make him stand out. Like a\nbullseye on a target.\nHe stumbled from the doorway, struggling with the brass buttons, and\nalmost straight into a group of heavyset men. Workers, maybe, from one of\nthe foundries in the neighbourhood. But there was a wildness in their eyes,\nwhites showing stark in their grease-smeared faces.\nThey stared at him, and he at them.\n“Now listen,” he said, raising one weak hand. “I was just doing—”"

Not in his duty, or his oath, or his sympathy\nfor their cause, or his reasonable monarchism. It was not a day for the\nreasonable, let alone for whatever defines an officer. One of them put his\nhead down and charged. Leeb managed to throw a single punch as he came.\nA harmless one, which missed the mark and bounced off the man’s\nforehead.\nHis brother had once told him how to punch, but he hadn’t really been\nlistening. He wished he’d listened now. But then his brother hadn’t really\nknown anything about punching, either.\nThe man caught Leeb in the side with his shoulder, knocked his wind\nout, lifted him bodily and brought him down on the wet cobbles with a\nstunning crash.\nThen they were all on him, kicking, swearing. Slavering madmen.\nFurious animals. Leeb curled up as best he could, whimpering at each blow.\nSomething hit him so hard in the back he was sick. To his horror, he saw\none of them take out a knife.\nIt was a shock when Cal pulled the blade. Maybe it shouldn’t have been.\nDoors knew he carried one. He stopped kicking the officer to stare at it.\nThought about shouting at him not to do it. But by then Cal was stabbing.\n“Shit,” whispered Doors. Hadn’t planned on killing anyone when he left\nhis spot in the mill and ran out to join the Breakers flooding down the\nSparway. Not sure what he had been planning. Setting things right, maybe.\nGetting a fair deal for once. Not this, anyway. They all looked shocked. Cal\nmost of all.\n“Had to be done,” he said, staring down at the poor bastard wheezing\nand spitting blood and leaking red all over the street. “Had to be done.”\nDoors didn’t see why. Wasn’t like this fool had set their wages. They\ncould’ve given him a kicking. Taught him a lesson. Left it at that. But\nwhether it had to be done or not, it was done now. No undoing it.\n“Come on.” Doors turned. Left the dying officer behind. Started\nhurrying back towards the Sparway. Towards the Agriont. Didn’t know\nwhat’d happen when they got there, just like they hadn’t known what’d\nhappen when they started kicking that officer.\nRegrets were for tomorrow.\n“They’re here.” Shawley watched a set run down the alley below, footsteps\nclapping from the fronts of the narrow buildings, and he tossed back the last\nof his wine and swung his legs from the window seat.\n“Who’s here?” slurred Rill, her eyes all unfocused from the husk.\n“The Breakers, you fucking dunce,” and he planted his hand on her face\nand shoved her back onto the bed. She caught her head on the headboard as\nshe fell, and put fingers to her scalp, and the tips came away bloody, and\nShawley had to burst out laughing.

        "text": "Shawley had to burst out laughing. He’d always been quite the joker.\nHe took his hatchet from the table and slid the haft up his sleeve. “Good\ntime to settle some scores, I reckon.” And he perched his hat on his head at\njust the right angle, straightened his collar in the mirror, took one last pinch\nof pearl dust, then trotted jauntily down the stairs and out into the street.\nThere was an explosive feel to the air. A feel of things ripped up so they\ncould be put back together a new way. A woman ran past him, screaming, or\nmaybe laughing, and Shawley tipped his hat to her. He was known for his\ngood manners. Then he stood out of the way so some men could dash by,\ngripping his axe all the while. Just in case, you understand. He wasn’t the\nonly one with scores to settle, and Shawley had a lot of enemies. Always\nhad a talent for making ’em.\nHe passed a ragged old couple stripping a dead officer lying in a slick of\nblood and swaggered on, keeping his head down, sticking to the back\nstreets and the shortcuts. Always had a knack for finding his way. He’d been\nworried that getting through Arnault’s Wall might be a problem. Been\nthinking about slipping through the sewers, though it would’ve ruined the\nnice boots he’d stolen off that merchant. But the Sable Gate stood wide\nopen. Must’ve been a fight there, a crowd dragging the bloody corpses of\nsome King’s Own up onto the walls. The guts were hanging out of one. The\nhead was off another. Shawley had no clue where it might’ve ended up.\nSeemed impolite to ask. He tipped his hat to a hideous woman with no more\nthan four teeth in her head and slipped through the gate.\nHe could hear the violence, further on. The mad noise, spreading\nthrough the richer districts inside Arnault’s Wall. They might call it the\nPeople’s Army, and there might be a few high principles tossed about, but if\nyou wanted his opinion, there were plenty of thugs with pretty excuses\nmixed in, and no small number who weren’t even bothering with the\nexcuses, just turning a quick profit from the chaos. Evidence of their\nhandiwork all over. Shawley stopped to filch a nice ring off a corpse that\nsomeone had left begging. Always been blessed with sharp eyes.\nHe saw the house. How often had he stood outside, in the shadows,\nplanning his revenge? Now, thanks to happy circumstances, it dropped in\nhis lap and he just had to catch it. The gate was locked but he slipped off his\ncoat and tossed it over the railings on top of the wall while no one was\nlooking. He took a run up and jumped over, slipped through the wet garden\nwhere the bushes were clipped to look like birds or some such. Bloody\nwaste of money if you wanted his opinion. Money that should’ve been his.\nThe dining-room window still didn’t lock properly and Shawley eased it\nopen, slipped over the sill and dropped down silent in the darkened room on\nthe other side. Always had a knack for treading softly. Place hadn’t changed\nmuch. Dark table and chairs, dark dresser with the silver plate gleaming.\nSilver plate that should’ve been his.\nHe heard laughter, talking, more laughter. A woman’s voice, he thought,"

A woman’s voice, he thought,\na young woman, an older man. They’d no idea what was happening in the\ncity yet, by the sound of it. Strange, that fifty strides from the madness it\ncould be just an ordinary day. He padded down the corridor and peered\naround a door frame.\nIt was an odd scene given the carnage in the streets. A girl of twenty\nwith a mass of blonde hair stood admiring herself in a mirror of Visserine\nglass which must’ve cost more’n Shawley’s house. She wore a half-made\ndress of shining fabric, two seamstresses attending to her—a young one\nwith a mouthful of pins and an old one on her knees busy stitching at a hem.\nFurnevelt sat in a corner, wine glass in his hand. He had his back to\nShawley, but you could see him smiling in the mirror as he watched it all\ndone.\nAnd Shawley realised the girl must be Furnevelt’s daughter. That was\nhow long he’d been waiting. Should’ve just killed the old bastard where he\nsat, but Shawley wanted him to know. So he stepped around the door frame\nand tipped his hat.\n“Ladies,” he said, smirking into the mirror, and they turned to look,\npuzzled. Not scared yet. That’d come. Shawley couldn’t remember her\nname, Furnevelt’s daughter, but she’d turned out so pretty. That’s what\nhappens when you grow up with all these advantages. These advantages\nthat should’ve been his.\n“Shawley?” Furnevelt jumped from his chair, a delicious shock across\nhis face. “I thought I told you never to come back here!”\n“You told me a lot of things.” Shawley let the axe slide from his sleeve\nso he was gripping the haft. “You self-righteous old shit.” And he hit him on\nthe side of the head.\nFurnevelt got his hand up and knocked it wide, but the blade still caught\nhis scalp, blood flying across the room.\nHe made a funny little gasp, stumbled, dropped his wine glass and it\nbroke across the floor.\nOne of the dressmakers screamed, pins falling from her open mouth.\nFurnevelt’s daughter stared, the tendons starting from her pale bare feet.\nSecond time, Shawley caught Furnevelt right between the eyes, axe\nsinking into his skull with a bang.\nThe dressmaker screamed again. Bloody irritating scream she had.\nFurnevelt’s daughter sprinted out, fast as a ferret given she had all that\nhalf-stitched cloth about her. “Damn it!” Shawley had to get her, too, to\nmake it fair, but the axe was stuck fast in Furnevelt’s skull and however he\ntugged it wouldn’t come free. “Get back here, bitch!”\nLilott ran. There was no thought involved. She fled in terror down the hall,\nspurred on by the shrieks of her dressmakers. She fumbled with the locks,\nplunged across the gardens, crashed through the gate. She ran, clutching up\nthe gauzy skirts of her unfinished wedding dress, her bare feet slapping at\nthe wet cobbles."

She ran, clutching up\nthe gauzy skirts of her unfinished wedding dress, her bare feet slapping at\nthe wet cobbles.\nShe burst into the square. People everywhere. People shocked, joyous,\ncurious, furious. Strange people with strange intensities of emotion twisting\ntheir pale faces into animal masks. Where had they come from?\nA man stood on a packing crate, screaming something about votes.\nLeering labourers bellowed back at him. A woman with wild hair bounced\non a big man’s shoulders, shaking a sword and swearing at the sky. Lilott\nhad been about to scream for help, but some instinct made her bite her lip\nand shrink against the wall, trying to catch her breath. She hardly knew\nwhat had happened. The Breakers, she supposed. It must be the Breakers.\nShe once listened to one of them give a speech. Hidden at the back of a\nmeeting in a shawl she borrowed from her maid. She had thought it such a\ndaring thing to do, had been expecting fire and fury and, well… danger. But\nit had all sounded so reasonable. Fair pay. Equitable hours. Decent\ntreatment. She had hardly been able to understand why everyone was so\nafraid of them. Later, flushed and eager, she had repeated all the arguments\nto her father. He had told her she had no notion of the complexities of\nmanaging a labour market, that what seemed to her eminent good sense\nmight sound to some ears like treason, and that this was not the kind of\nthing the lady of taste he was raising her to be would ever need to worry\nabout.\nIn that much, at least, he had been horribly mistaken.\nShe limped down a crowded street. The sun had gone in and a chilly\ngust brought a new sprinkle of rain. Someone was playing a fiddle far too\nfast and they danced, and whooped, and clapped, like guests at a\nparticularly wild party, and not far away a well-dressed corpse was draped\nover a railing, blood dripping from its broken skull and trickling in the\ngutter. Was her father dead? She gave a kind of moan, had to bite her\nknuckle to keep from screaming.\nThere had been warning signs. The price of bread and meat, she heard\nfrom the cook, kept going up. Loyalty in the army, she heard from Harbin,\nkept going down. There had been that uprising in Valbeck. Vague worries\nthat there might be more when the rebels landed in Midderland. News of\nthe king’s victory had brought relief. But then came the rumours of\nBreakers approaching Adua. Then came the curfew, then the arrests by the\nInquisition, then the hangings by the Closed Council.\nShe had suggested they postpone the wedding, but her father was as deaf\nto that as he had been to the Breakers’ arguments. He refused to put off his\nonly child’s happiness on account of a crowd of ruffians. Harbin laughed at\nthe notion that the capital could fall to an army of peasants, so Lilott forced\nout laughter, too, since agreeing with your husband-to-be was expected of a\nyoung lady. At least before the marriage.

They had convinced themselves it\nwould not happen.\nThey had been horribly mistaken on that score, too.\nShe hardly recognised the streets she had grown up in, flooded with\ncrazed humanity, surging on invisible currents of joy and fury. She was so\ncold. Not exactly crying but her eyes and her nose constantly leaking, her\nbare shoulders clammy from the drizzle and her bare feet bruised from the\nunforgiving cobblestones. Her breath came in terrified whoops, her skin\ncrawling under her half-finished, pearl-stitched bodice.\nOnly that morning it had felt so important that all the right guests should\naccept their invitations. That the words of their vows be perfect. That the\nhem of her dress was stitched just so. Now the hem of her dress was black\nwith road-filth and, Fates help her, speckled brown with her father’s blood,\nand all the world was turned upside down and inside out.\nShe hobbled on. Not knowing where she was or where she was heading.\nSome unsewn flap of her dress caught on a broken fence as she ran past and\nnearly jerked her off her bare feet. Someone laughed at her. Another\nclapped. On any other day, a desperate, barefooted girl in a blood-spattered\nwedding dress would have excited some attention. Today it was nothing to\nremark upon. The whole city had gone mad. The whole world.\nOver the roofs she glimpsed the parapet of the Tower of Chains, the\ntallest tower of the Agriont, and she gave a moan of relief. But when she\nburst gasping onto the paving stones beside the moat it became a groan of\nhorror.\nShe had wandered lazily across this bridge on happy summer days,\namong the wealthy revellers, on her way to the Agriont’s park to see and be\nseen, to applaud the fencers at the Summer Contest. She remembered\nsmiling at floating ducklings following their mother in dignified single file,\nremembered counting the green and red and purple lily pads with Harbin,\non the day he proposed. So picturesque.\nThe gates were sealed now. People were crushed against them, waving\nfrantically, wailing at the towering gatehouse to be let in. An old woman in\na very fine dress was scratching at the wood with her fingernails. Lilott\nadded her voice to the rest as she staggered across the bridge. She hardly\nknew what else to do. “Help!” she screeched. “Help!”\nShe saw a pale man with a red scarf staring past her and spun about to\nfollow his eyes. A crowd was coming up the wide Middleway, banners\nbobbing over it, steel of pikes and armour glinting.\n“Oh no,” she whispered. She could not run any more. There was\nnowhere left to run to. A house was on fire, smoke rolling from the upstairs\nwindows into the spitting sky.\nPeople began to scatter, knocking each other down, trampling each other\nin their mindless haste. Lilott took an elbow in the face and tottered back,\ntasting blood. Her foot caught in her torn dress, the parapet hit her in the\nknees and, with a despairing gasp, she tumbled over.\nIt was not that far to the moat, but even so the water hit her hard,"

The\nfloating glory of her dress became an instant dead weight, fabric clutching\nat her, dragging her down. She was beyond exhaustion. Beyond terror. Part\nof her wanted just to sink, but another would not let go, made her thrash,\nkick, struggle.\nShe came up coughing dirty water, wriggled through the clutching,\nslapping lily pads, far less picturesque at close quarters, and into the\ndarkness under the bridge. She pressed herself to the slimy stones, hair\nplastered across her face, her head full of the smell of vegetable rot.\nNot far away a corpse floated, face down. A hint of sodden cloth, of\ntangled hair. She watched it turn slowly, bump against the moss-covered\nwall of the moat, drift away. She wondered who it had been. She wondered\nwho she was now. She wondered if she would live out the hour. Everything\nwas changed.\nThe People’s Army was coming. Wasn’t she the people, too? When had\nshe become their enemy? She squeezed her eyes shut, shivering in the icy\nwater, and gave up trying to smother her own sobs. No one could have\nheard them over the deafening noise of the mob above. Tramping boots,\nclashing metal, breaking glass, rumbling wagon wheels. A demon with\nmany voices.\n“Bread! Give us bread!”\n“Send out the Closed Council!”\n“The Great Change is come!”\n“Let us in, you fuckers.”\n“Let us in or we break in!”\nAnd, louder than all, a sawing, maddened shriek. “Bring out His fucking\nMajesty!”\n“Bring him out!” screamed Mother Mostly, shoving forward.\nThey’d made it to the Agriont. Ready to seize their own justice for once,\nrather’n be crushed by the king’s. But now folk held up. From some shred\nof respect for their old masters, or fear of ’em, at least. They loitered at the\nhead of the bridge.\n“There’s men up there!” someone said. “King’s men, with bows!”\nMother Mostly’s eyesight weren’t near good enough to see any king’s\nmen that far off. The whole gatehouse was a looming blur over the heads of\nthe folk packed in front. The king’s men couldn’t kill this whole crowd, but\nno doubt they could kill a few, and no one was eager to be first.\nBut Mother Mostly wouldn’t be fucking bullied. Her father had tried it,\nwhen she was a girl, and she’d stabbed him with a knitting needle and run\naway from home. Her first husband had tried it, and she’d stabbed him with\na butcher’s knife and rolled his body into the canal. The Styrians had tried\nit, when they came to put their boot across the Arches. They’d come asking\nfor money and she’d told ’em to go back where they fucking came from.\nThey’d beaten her, but she healed. They’d cut two of her fingers off, and\nshe got her hands back in the soap the same day. They’d smashed her doors,"

They’d smashed her doors,\nsmashed her shutters, smashed her tubs, but she got new ones. In the end\ntheir boss turned up, and she was sure he’d kill her, but he gave her a nod of\nrespect instead. She needn’t pay, he’d said. She alone.\nIt was just a fact. Everyone in the Arches knew it. Mother Mostly won’t\nbe fucking bullied. Not by Styrians. Not by king’s men. Not by anyone.\nSo she shouldered through the crowd, skirts gathered up and tucked into\nher belt the way she did when there was work to do. She jostled her way to\nthe front, which one way or another she’d been doing all her life, using her\nelbows and her fixed jaw and her great loud voice. “Out o’ my way!”\nForced a path through the big men, the armed men, the armoured men, still\nloitering. They might be hard on the outside, but they were soft where it\ncounted. Mother Mostly hadn’t been born with much softness in her, and a\nlife in the laundries had pared away what there was and left her as yielding\nas a length of wire.\nShe shoved onto the empty bridge, giving the towering gatehouse, and\nits notched battlements, and its slitted windows the kind of baleful frown\nshe gave to folk owed her money.\n“I’m a woman of the Union!” she roared. “Fifty years, and I’ve worked\nevery one of ’em! I won’t be bullied, you hear?”\nCheers and jeers behind her, whoops and hoots, like folk watching\nfreaks dance at a sideshow.\n“Bring out that Styrian cunt!” she screamed at the battlements, shaking\nher knife. “The king’s mother!”\n“She ain’t there!” someone called from behind. “Scurried back to Styria\nmonths ago!”\nMother Mostly glowered up at the gatehouse, still a blur, more or less,\nbut she knew there must be men up there, and she wasn’t about to be bullied\nby the bastards.\nShe took another step forward. “Then bring out her cunt of a son, the\nking!”\nRithinghorm pressed his mouth to the arrow-loop and bellowed at the very\ntop of his voice. “Halt! In the name of His Majesty!”\nHe leaned back to survey the results. Those words had always worked\nmagic before, conjuring obedience from thin air. But now, suddenly, the\nspell had no effect. “I order you to bloody halt!” He doubted the crowd\ncould even hear him over their own clamour. He could hardly hear himself\nover his own thudding heart.\nEarlier that week, Lord Marshal Rucksted had addressed their regiment.\nTold them they were the last line of defence. Told them failure was\nunthinkable, retreat impossible. Rithinghorm had always admired Rucksted.\nExcellent beard. Lot of dash. The very style of officer he wanted to be.

Now\nRithinghorm knew why.\nPeople continued to flood from the buildings on the other side of the\nmoat and into an ever-thicker press at the end of the bridge. Breakers!\nTraitors! Here, at the very gates of the Agriont! And so many. He could\nscarcely credit it. They were starting to move out onto the bridge itself. One\nin particular, leading the way, some dirty bloody peasant woman with her\nskirt tucked into her belt so her pale, sinewy legs showed, waving a knife,\nscreeching words he could scarcely hear. Something about someone’s son.\n“Inconceivable,” whispered Rithinghorm. If he had read it in one of his\nsister’s storybooks he would have dismissed it as a fantasy.\nThey had to be kept away from the gate. They had to be cleared from the\nbridge. They had to be taught a damn lesson.\nHe pointed towards that shrieking woman.\n“Shoot her!”\n“Sir?” said Parry, blinking. Damn, his mouth was dry. Kept having to lick\nhis lips.\nCaptain Rithinghorm came close to point through the arrow-loop. Close\nenough that Parry could hear his breath echoing in the narrow chain room.\nClose enough that he could smell him. He must wear some kind of perfume.\nHint of lavender. He pointed down, white with anger. Down towards that\nlaundry-woman.\n“I said shoot her!”\nParry licked his lips again. Bow was ready. He’d made sure of that. Or\nhis hands had done it for him, following the old routine. He sighted up, nice\nand careful. Strangest thing. She reminded Parry of his mother. She used to\ntuck her skirts in like that, when she was mopping floors.\n“Shoot, then!”\nParry wanted to follow orders. Always followed ’em before. But his\nhand wouldn’t let go the string. The woman was coming closer, screeching\naway. That reminded him of his mother, too. Folk were starting to follow\nher example, edging out onto the bridge, towards the gate.\nHe licked his lips. Again. Just didn’t seem right, to shoot that woman.\nSlowly, Parry lowered his bow.\n“What are you doing?”\nParry took the arrow from the string and, not sure what to do with it, put\nit behind his back. “Doesn’t seem right,” he said.\nRithinghorm seized him by the jacket. “I gave you an order!”\n“I know.” Everyone was looking at them now. “I’m very sorry, sir.”\nRithinghorm started to shake him. “Are you a damn traitor?”\nParry could only swallow, and blink, and grip that arrow tight behind his\nback, and shake his head. “I… don’t think so.” He honestly wasn’t sure.\n“Just… doesn’t seem right.”\nRithinghorm threw him back against the wall, jaw muscles squirming on\nthe sides of his taut face. “Sergeant Hope!”\n“Sir?” said the sergeant.\nRithinghorm pointed a stabbing finger at Parry. “Kill this man!”\nSergeant Hope stared down at his drawn short-sword, a long slit of light"

He had done, out in Styria. But\nnot this little fucker. This little bastard with his fine accent and his pale face\nand his thin fingers and his bloody perfume, ordering good men killed.\nOrdering the citizens of Adua shot at. It came to him that he had more in\ncommon with those Breakers chanting outside on the bridge than he did\nwith Rithinghorm. They were just people. People who wanted to be heard.\nPeople who wanted enough to get by, while others had so much more’n\nthey could ever need.\nTwenty years, he’d been doing as he was told. Never seen another way.\nBut just like that, sharp as fingers snapped under his nose, he decided to\nstop.\n“No,” he said.\nRithinghorm gave a strange sort of hoot, mouth and eyes wide with\nsurprise, when the short-sword slid into his well-pressed uniform jacket.\nHope dragged the blade back and Rithinghorm plucked weakly at his\nshoulder, cheeks puffed right out. Hope shoved him away, lifted the sword\nand hacked it into Rithinghorm’s skull. Blood spattered. It’s always a\nsurprise, how much a man holds.\nHe blinked at his captain’s corpse for a moment. He felt light-headed.\nHe felt light all over. As if a fully laden pack had been snatched from his\nshoulders.\nThrough the slitted windows he could see the bridge was a solid press of\npeople. He could hear the gates creaking below under the pressure.\nHe turned to the men. They were staring at him. Parry and all the rest.\nSo young, they were. Good lads. Could he ever have looked that young,\nwhen he first joined? They didn’t know what to say. What to do. Hope\ndidn’t know, either, but they had to do something.\nHe pointed towards the stair. “Guess we’d better open the gates.”\nSmiler heard the clonk of the bar, the rattle of bolts, then the gates gave\nunder the pressure and people surged forwards like a river in spate through\na burst dam. Folk pressed against him so tight, he struggled not to prick ’em\nby accident with the spike on the back of his war hammer.\nThere was a maid there, bonnet skewed across her face. There was a\nman might’ve been a wheelwright, or a cooper. There was a fellow looked\nno better’n a beggar. Citizens of Adua picked up that day, citizens of the\nUnion picked up in their march across Midderland, all mixed in with the\nFirst Breakers’ Regiment, men like Smiler who’d fought in the wars in\nStyria, then in the bread riots in Keln, then struggled in the mills in Valbeck,\nthen been armed with Angland steel and marched to free ’emselves from\ntyranny. Now all that sacrifice and struggle were finally bearing fruit—the\nGreat Change, come at last.\nThey tumbled eagerly up the tunnel into the rotten heart of the old order."

But Smiler didn’t want to stop. He wanted to smash this whole\ncorrupt place. These grasping bastards who’d sent his friends to die in\nStyria, to die in the mills, to die in the cellars. He wanted to burn away the\nrot and make a country for its people.\nSmiler picked out a man to charge at, peeking over the top of his shield\nwith desperate eyes. He let go a roar of hate, of joy, of triumph, the\nflagstones flying under his feet, the brothers surging to freedom all around\nhim.\nTheir shields crashed together. They struggled and strained, and Smiler\ngot a glimpse of the man’s bared teeth and his wide eyes then suddenly the\npressure was gone and he was stumbling forwards, and he saw Roys had\nswung his halberd and staved the man’s helmet in.\nIt was a slaughter, really. The royalists were already breaking, and they\nscurried away towards the great statues at the far end of the square, and men\ncharged after them, whooping and screaming, leaving Smiler to stare down\nat the dead soldier with the dented helmet.\nCame to him then how easily he could’ve been in that line, if things had\nworked out just a little different. If he’d stayed in the army when they came\nback from Styria, instead of walking away in disgust. There was only a\ncoin-toss between him and these corpses.\n“You’re a hero!” And a woman with a strong chin and her hair bound in\na red scarf craned up to plant a great soft kiss on his jaw. “You’re all bloody\nheroes!”\nThe soldier blinked down at her, his helmet skewed, surprised, she thought,\nbut not disappointed. So long since Adnes last kissed a man she didn’t\nknow how to tell. But it wasn’t a romantic thing so much as joy at having\nhope again. Or maybe it was a romantic thing, ’cause he grabbed her around\nthe back of the head and kissed her on the mouth, and she clung on to him,\nwhich was uncomfortable on account of the hardness of his breastplate, and\nthere was a great warmth right through her and she was sucking greedily at\nhis tongue which tasted of onions, and a fine taste it was, too.\nShe never would’ve dreamed she might kiss a stranger like that, but it\nwas a new day and the king’s men were beaten and all the old rules were\ngone, and the sun showed through again and made the soldiers’ armour"

Was this freedom?\nThey were dragged apart by the flood of cheering people then shoved\nback together, carried across the Square of Marshals and up the grand steps\nof the Lords’ Round, through the inlaid doors. Adnes stared up to the dome,\nhigh, high above, and around her, in the vast and heavy silence, hundreds of\npeople who never thought in their lives to pass through those doors did the\nsame.\nShe looked at the gilding, and the different-coloured marbles, and the\nrare woods, and the suns stitched into the cushions on the benches, and the\nstained-glass windows that showed scenes she didn’t understand. A bald\nman holding out a crown. A bearded man with a sword standing over two\nothers. A young man lit by a ray of sun as he stood up alone from a crowd.\nThe spotless grandeur of the place. Nothing could be further from the farm\nshe’d left when the People’s Army came through, where they’d slept on\nstraw on the floor of a shack, and worn their hands to the meat, and been\ntreated by the local lordling like they were less than dirt.\nWell, they were the masters now.\nThey carried Risinau in on a gilded chair they must’ve torn from some\nchamber, some office, some hall. Adnes grabbed at a leg of it, one in a\nforest of hands, helping it pass, and Risinau laughed, and they laughed, and\nthe joyous crowd cheered as they carried him bobbing down the aisle\nbetween the curved benches, and set him on the great table.\nFolk had got up to the public gallery and were singing and clapping, the\nechoes of their joy bouncing about the great space and bringing it alive like\nit couldn’t have been since that dome was raised. There was a flower girl up\nthere and she had a sack of petals and was throwing handfuls down,\nfluttering like butterflies through the shafts of coloured light to carpet the\ntiles below, and Adnes had never seen so beautiful a thing. Made her think\nof her husband’s grave, and her sons’ graves, down in the wood where the\nwildflowers grew, and that brought a blur of tears to her eyes. So much joy\nand so much pain together she thought her chest would split with it.\n“You have brought the dream to life, my friends!” roared Risinau, and\nthere was a cheer so loud it made Adnes’s teeth rattle and her ears ring and\nher heart throb.\n“Risinau!” people squealed. “Risinau!” And Adnes made a great\nsobbing, meaningless wail, reaching out towards him.\n“Equality, my brothers! Unity, my sisters! A new beginning! A country\ngoverned by all, in the interests of all. You will say on your deathbeds, with\na smile, that you were here! The day the Lords’ Round was made the\nCommons’ Round! The day of the Great Change!”\nShe was crying, and all about her men and women were crying and\nlaughing, all at once."

        "text": "Commons’ Round! The day of the Great Change!”\nShe was crying, and all about her men and women were crying and\nlaughing, all at once.\nIt was the day their dreams came true. The day their new Union was\nborn.\nThe soldier caught her hand, and there were tears on his face, too, but he\nwas smiling. He’d a fine smile, she thought. “I don’t know your name.”\n“Who cares a shit?” And she dragged his helmet off so she could push\nher fingers through his sweaty hair, and started kissing him again.\nEttenbeck slipped from a side door of the Lords’ Round and into a narrow\nstreet behind the building. He had thought he would be safe in there. Where\ncould be safer than the very heart of the Union? But now the Breakers were\ninside. He could hear them cheering. He could hear them crashing through\nthe buildings all about him!\nPerhaps this was how it had been when the Gurkish invaded, and the\nEaters broke into the Agriont. He remembered his uncle telling him the\nstory, his watery eyes fixed on the far distance, as though at horrors beyond\nimagining. But these were not cannibal sorcerers, not inhuman and\nunknowable demons, not the wielders of forbidden powers. Just ordinary\npeople.\nA window shattered in the Commission for Land and Agriculture and a\ndesk came flying through, crashing to the ground not far away. Ettenbeck\ncould feel the sweat running down his scalp. Leaking out of him as if he\nwas a squeezed sponge. It took every vestige of self-control he had not to\nbreak into a desperate sprint. The walls of the palace compound might still\nhold firm. Perhaps if he could make it there—\n“There’s one!” He heard footsteps clapping from the buildings. “Stop\nhim!” Now he ran, but not far. Someone caught him under the arm and\nthrew him down. A flash of a bearded face, armour that looked new-forged.\nHe was dragged up again by the elbow. A strange gang. Like the people you\nmight see at one of the cheap markets. Only furious.\nAnd Ettenbeck realised that ordinary people can be utterly terrifying.\n“Where you going, fucker?” growled a man with a scar on his chin.\n“There’s no escaping the people’s justice!” squealed a woman and\nslapped him across the face.\n“We’re in charge now!”\nHe could hardly understand their grinding accents. He did not know\nwhat they wanted. Did not know what he could possibly give them. “My\nname is Ettenbeck,” he said, for no reason that made any sense. They\nshoved him onwards. His cheek was burning.\nThere were other prisoners caught up in the crowd. Administrators.\nBureaucrats. Clerks. A couple of soldiers. Herded like animals. Prodded\nalong with spears. A grinning coachman was flicking at them with his\ncarriage whip, making them howl and whimper. Ettenbeck knew one man’s\nbloody face, but his name had gone. All their names had gone.\n“Profiteers!” someone was screaming in a broken voice. “Speculators!”\nA dark-skinned fellow was being kicked along the street, and he would\nstumble up, and be kicked down again, up, and down.

Kadir, maybe? A charming, cultured\nman. Ettenbeck had heard him speak very movingly to the Solar Society\nabout closer cooperation across the Circle Sea. Now they had knocked his\nhat off and were spitting on him.\n“Bastard!” snarled a man in soldier’s clothes who had stripped his jacket\noff, his shirt spotted with blood. “Bastard!” And he stamped on the\nambassador’s head.\nSomething hit Ettenbeck on the side of his face and he fell. The ground\ncracked him hard. He wobbled up to his hands and knees. His jaw was\nthrobbing. “Oh,” he muttered, blood pattering on the cobbles. “Oh dear.” A\ntooth fell out of his numb mouth.\nHe was caught by the elbow again, dragged up again, pain shooting\nthrough his armpit, and sent stumbling on.\n“Profiteers!” a woman shrieked, spit spraying, eyes bulging, pointing at\nhim with a rolling pin. “Speculators!”\n“He’s one o’ those Closed Council bastards!”\n“I’m just a clerk!” Ettenbeck’s voice was a desperate squeal. It was a lie.\nHe was one of the senior under-secretaries for Agricultural Taxation. How\nproudly he had murmured the title to himself when he received the\npromotion. His sister would finally have to take him seriously. How he\nwished now he had never even come to Adua, let alone to the Agriont. But\nyou’ll buy nothing with wishes, as his mother always loved to say.\nHe kicked and twisted as they dragged him across the little square in\nfront of the Land Registry Building towards the fountain. An ugly thing, a\nwide, waist-high stone bowl of water with a twisting mass of spouting stone\nfish rising from the centre. It was by no means improved by a corpse draped\nover the rim, arse in the air and the pointed toes of fashionable shoes\nscraping the flagstones.\nEttenbeck realised they were dragging him up next to the body. “Wait!”\nhe squealed, and he caught the stone basin, spray splashing in his face,\nthrashing desperately, but there were hands all around him, one of his legs\nwas lifted, the other shoe falling off as it scuffed on the ground. Someone\ncaught the back of his head.\n“One last drink at the people’s expense, Councillor!”\nAnd they shoved his face into the water. Through the gurgle of the\nfountain he heard shouting. Singing. Laughing. He fought his way up, just\nfor a moment, gasped in a breath, saw the mad crowd surging on towards\nthe House of Questions. They shook swords and spears in the air. One had a\nsevered head spiked on it, bobbing obscenely over the mob. Absurd. Like a\ncheap prop in a badly produced play. Except it was real.\nHe was shoved down again, into the fountain, bubbles rushing.\nNo More Trouble\nB\nroad did what he’d been doing ever since they locked him in this cell.

It was only five steps\nfrom one side to the other and those were small ones, but he paced anyway,\nand while he paced he chewed over and over all the stupid things he’d done\nto land himself here. Sometimes he kicked the wall, or dug his aching fist\ninto his sore hand, or slapped himself hard enough to hurt. Seemed he\ncouldn’t help hurting people. With no one else to hand, he hurt himself.\nHe’d promised no more trouble, then let himself get sucked in yet again.\nHigh Treason would be the charge, he was guilty as hell and there was only\none punishment. Savine wouldn’t be saving him this time. She was locked\nup, too, somewhere in this buried warren of a place. She couldn’t even save\nherself.\nHe made a promise, then. If, by some undeserved twist of fate, he\nwriggled free of this, he’d live for Liddy and May. “No more trouble,” he\nwhispered, and he ground his forehead against the rough stone wall. “No\nmore.” He swore it. One more time.\nThen he heard footsteps beyond the heavy door. They were coming. To\nask their questions? Or just drag him straight to the scaffold? He clenched\nhis fists, but he knew fighting would do no good. It was fighting landed him\nhere in the first place. The key scraped in the lock, his breath coming fast\nthrough his clenched teeth as he watched the door creak open.\nA face showed at the gap. Not the black-masked Practical he’d expected.\nA small woman, cheeks full of broken veins. She looked nervous, like she\nhadn’t known what to expect, then when she saw him standing there, she\nbroke into a beaming smile. “Brother! You’re free!”\nBroad couldn’t do much but stare. “I’m what?”\n“Free!” She shook a ring of keys at him. “We all are!” And she vanished,\nleaving the door wide open.\nHe heard laughter out there now. Cheering and singing. Was that a high\nlittle flute playing somewhere? Like a rowdy market day in the village\nwhen he was a boy. He nudged his lenses up his nose, scraped his courage\ntogether and went to the door.\n“Brother!” A man wearing bright new armour spotted with blood hauled\nBroad out into the mould-stained corridor, but the way you’d greet a long-\nlost comrade rather than the way you’d drag a convict to their death.\n“You’re free!”\nThey were unlocking the cells, and with each door flung open they’d\ngive a cheer, and at each prisoner pulled out they’d give another. Armoured\nmen hugged a woman must’ve spent months in the darkness, pale and\nshrivelled, squinting at the light like it hurt her. “What’s your name, Sister?”\nShe just sat against the wall, floppy as a rag doll. “Is it… Grise?” she\nwhispered. Broad saw one of her hands was all smashed, crooked fingers\nbloated like sausages.\nSomeone clutched at his shirt. “Have you seen my son?” An old man"

Broad saw one of her hands was all smashed, crooked fingers\nbloated like sausages.\nSomeone clutched at his shirt. “Have you seen my son?” An old man\nwith wild, weepy eyes. “Do you know where my son is?”\nBroad brushed him off. “I don’t know anything.”\nSomeone threw their arms around him from behind and he had to\nsmother an instinct to lash out with an elbow. “Ain’t it wonderful?” A girl\nno older than sixteen with a patchy shawl about her shoulders, crying and\nsmiling at once. “Ain’t it wonderful?” And she grabbed someone else, and\nthey danced a floppy jig together and barged over an old woman who’d\nbeen brandishing a mop with a knife tied to the end. She nearly stabbed\nBroad with it as she fell.\nMaybe he should’ve felt a caper coming on himself at his unexpected\ntaste of freedom, but Broad had seen this mix of mad joy and mad anger\nbefore, during the uprising in Valbeck. Knowing how that turned out didn’t\nmake him want to dance. Made him want to slip back to his cell and lock\nhimself in.\nThere were Breakers among the crowd. Veterans with shiny new gear\nBroad well recognised. The arms and armour he’d brought from Ostenhorm\non Savine’s orders and handed over to Judge in return for the Breakers’\nsupport. Looked like they’d risen up after all. Just on their own timetable.\nBroad had to push against a joyful current of people to get up the steps,\ninto a wider, brighter hallway. A man in a leather apron ran past laughing, a\nwedge of documents clutched to his chest, papers slipping out and flapping\nto the floor. Another man bashed at a lock with a heavy ale flagon. This was\nwhere the music was coming from, a woman sitting cross-legged with some\nclerk’s tall hat jammed down to her eyebrows, eyes closed as she tooted\njauntily on her flute.\nAnd shuffling through the madness, freed as unexpectedly as Broad\nhimself, came his old employers, the Lord and Lady Governor of Angland.\nEven with his lenses on, it took him a moment to recognise them. The\nYoung Lion had his right arm around his wife’s shoulders, his gaunt face\nscattered with scabs and twisted with pain, moving in lurching hops with\nhis left arm uselessly dangling and one trouser leg rolled up to the stump.\nSavine had one arm around her husband, the other under her swollen belly,\nstruggling along with back bent and teeth bared, tufts of dark hair sticking\nfrom the bandages around her head.\nThey’d owned the world, these two. Now look.\n“Broad!” Savine clung to his arm painfully tight, a sheen of sweat on her\nblotchy face. “Thank the Fates you’re here!” The warble in her voice made\nhim think of that terrified waif who’d begged for his help on the barricades\nof Valbeck.\nBrock was clinging to the wall with his fingernails to stay upright.\n“What the hell’s happening?”\n“Not sure. But their gear…” Broad nodded at one of the armed men,\nlowering his voice. “It’s from your armoury in Ostenhorm.”\nSavine worked out in a blink what Broad had been slowly putting"

He held out his other hand to Brock. The one with\nthe tattoo on the back. You could see how much it hurt him, to need the\nhelp. But this was no time for pride. Wasn’t easy, steering a pregnant\nwoman and a one-legged man through that jostling crowd of rescuers and\nlooters. Beyond a set of broken double doors men smashed and laughed,\nturned over furniture, flinging armfuls of fluttering papers in the air.\n“That was my father’s office,” whispered Savine as they hobbled past.\nInside that room, the all-powerful Arch Lector Glokta had ordered life and\ndeath with a flick of his pen. Times had changed, all right.\n“Lord Marshal Brint!” called Brock. “You’re alive.”\n“Just barely.” A grey-haired man was pressed against one wall. He’d a\ntrace of military bearing, if you squinted, underneath a filthy officer’s jacket\nwith all markings of rank ripped off. Brock reached out to shake his hand.\nNot the easiest thing to do, since Brint had only one and Brock only one\nthat worked. “They took me prisoner before you landed. Lord bloody\nHeugen spilled his guts the moment we were caught.”\nBrock shook his head. “What a crowd of useless bastards the Open\nCouncil turned out to be.”\n“Who…” Savine forced through clenched teeth, “could have guessed?”\nThey struggled out blinking into bright daylight, down the steps at the\nfront of the House of Questions, the wind chill on Broad’s face. Should’ve\nbeen a relief, but the crowds outside were madder than ever, cheering and\nchanting, brandishing lit torches and swords and broken furniture.\nPapers scattered everywhere. Drifts like snow, ankle deep. Folk were\nflinging heaps of ’em from the windows, blowing about on the wind,\nyesterday’s secrets suddenly worthless. Place stank of smoke. A laughing\nman had blood all over his hands. Broad felt cold as he realised a smug-\nlooking bastard not far away had a head spiked on his spear. Its back was to\nBroad so he couldn’t see the face. Put him in mind of Musselia. A bag of\nfoul memories he tried never to open.\n“It’s the Young Lion!” someone called, and suddenly folk were\ncrowding around them, reaching out for Leo. “Look, it’s Leo dan Brock!”\n“Can’t be him!”\n“I saw him at his triumph!”\n“Where’s his leg?”\n“Lost it in the cause o’ freedom.”\n“The Young Lion!”\n“Please.” Leo struggled to hold them back with his one good arm. “Let\nme—”\n“He’s a bloody hero!” A big man dropped down behind Brock, and\nbefore anyone could do a thing about it he’d stood, hoisting the Young Lion\nhigh into the air on his shoulders."

One that Broad had\nmarched to out in Styria. Folk danced, and saluted, and patted the stump of\nthe Young Lion’s leg like he was some bloody mascot. Whether it made any\nreal sense or not, seemed they’d got their own successful rebellion and\nBrock’s failed one mixed up into one thing.\n“Still bowing to the nobles?” A fellow with heavy brows that met in the\nmiddle had come up with quite the scowl. “Where’s your fucking dignity?”\nhe snarled at the man who had Brock on his shoulders. “Carried these\nbastards on our backs all our lives, haven’t we? Ain’t we all equal now?”\nBroad could feel the mood shifting. There were doubting looks pointed\nhis way, and Savine’s way, too. If they realised she was the daughter of the\nman who’d tortured thousands in the building right behind…\n“Hold these.” Broad handed his lenses to Brint. Then he realised the ex-\nlord marshal couldn’t hold Savine and the lenses at once, so he tucked ’em\nin Brint’s jacket pocket and turned back to the crowd, which had become a\nmass of smeared colour.\n“I was at Stoffenbeck!” the fellow with the brows was snarling. “And he\ndidn’t fight for the fucking people, all he did—”\nBroad’s fist smashed into his blurred face. Before he fell Broad caught\nhis collar and punched him again.\n“I was there, too, and I say you’re a liar.” And Broad punched him one\nmore time. “The Young Lion’s a fucking hero!” It’d been a while since he\nbelieved in heroes, but plainly some folk still liked the notion. “Gave his leg\nand his arm for the people!” Broad flung the man against the wall of the\nHouse of Questions so he bounced off and rolled on the cobbles, hands\nclasped to his broken face.\n“A cheer for the Young Lion!” bellowed Brint, stepping forwards with\nhis one fist raised.\nLike that, the mood was changed back and they were cheering again,\nLeo dan Brock jolting about on that dancing man’s shoulders with his\nstump in the air and his limp arm flopping.\n“Wish I could get him down,” said Broad.\nSavine shook her head. “I’ve a feeling it will be safer for us all if he\nstays up there.”\n“That was… quick and decisive action,” murmured Brint, pressing the\nlenses back into Broad’s aching hand. “You were a Ladderman?”\nBroad frowned down at his tattoo. He realised there was a little piece of\ntooth stuck between two of his scarred knuckles.\n“I was,” he said, wincing as he picked it out and flicked it away.\nBrint watched the crowd cheer as they bounced Brock on their\nshoulders. “The Union will need men like you in the days to come.\nSomeone will have to restore order.”\n“My family needs me. That’s what matters.”\n“Of course,” said Brint. “But… you may serve them best by serving\nhere.”"

That’s what matters.”\n“Of course,” said Brint. “But… you may serve them best by serving\nhere.”\nBroad slowly hooked his lenses over his ears, carefully settled them into\nthat familiar groove on the bridge of his nose and gave a heavy sigh. He’d\nsworn to keep away from trouble, but here was the problem.\nTrouble wouldn’t keep away from him.\nBring Out the King\nO\nrso stared down from the palace gatehouse, hardly able to believe the\nevidence of his own senses.\nWhat could only be described as a horde of people had boiled from the\nKingsway and into the park, past the commanding statues of his father, of\nthe First of the Magi, and of a still-unfinished Arch Lector Glokta, surging\ntowards the palace gates in an apparently endless flood.\n“Where did they come from?” he muttered. A fool’s question to which\nhe already knew the answer. They came from Valbeck, from Keln, from\nAdua, from every corner of Midderland. They were the Union’s citizens.\nThey were his subjects. Or they had been, at any rate. It appeared his grand\ntour of the country was no longer necessary.\nIt had come to him.\nHe watched in stunned horror as Union flags were torn down, vandals\ndancing in triumph on the roofs. A few buildings remained in loyal hands,\nbut they were islands in a stormy sea, hopelessly besieged. Here and there,\nbloody little dramas unfolded. Tiny figures chased down a street. Tiny\nfigures tumbling from a window. Tiny figures hanged from trees.\nThe palace was its own well-guarded fortress within the fortress of the\nAgriont, but the Breakers were crowding in against its gates, swarming\nmore thickly with Orso’s every faintly wheezing breath.\n“Master Sulfur, would it be possible…?” He was sure the magus had\nbeen right beside him, but when Orso turned, Sulfur was nowhere to be\nseen. It appeared there would be no spectacular magical rescue today.\nSaving the king from a dozen Breakers was one thing. From countless\nthousands was clearly quite another. There comes a time, Orso supposed,\nwhen even such mighty creditors as the Banking House of Valint and Balk\nmust cut their losses.\n“Bring out the king!” someone screeched, their voice somehow rising\nabove the sullen murmur. There was a surge through the crowd, a shriek as\nsomeone fell in the midst, crushed underfoot. Did he hear the heavy gates\ncreak under the pressure? Something shattered against the parapet, not far\naway, and Orso ducked back on an instinct.\n“Your Majesty?” asked one of the officers. His face looked very pale\nabove his crimson collar. “Should we shoot?”\n“No!” Orso struggled to put some authority into his voice. “No one\nshoots! I won’t kill my own people. No more… of my own people,” he\nadded lamely, memories of the mass graves at Stoffenbeck floating up\nunbidden.\nLord Chancellor Gorodets drew himself up to his full height. Not a very\nimpressive height, but Orso appreciated the effort. “Every man here would\ndie for you, Your Majesty.”"

        "text": "unbidden.\nLord Chancellor Gorodets drew himself up to his full height. Not a very\nimpressive height, but Orso appreciated the effort. “Every man here would\ndie for you, Your Majesty.”\nCertainly there were plenty of square jaws firmly set on the palace\nbattlements. Knights of the Body and Knights Herald, the elite of the elite.\nBut one could discern a stiffening undercurrent of doubt behind the heroic\nfaçade. Laying down one’s life for one’s king sounds very fine in principle,\nbut when it comes to actually doing it, and one realises one has just the\nsingle life to give, enthusiasm understandably wanes.\n“I’d rather they didn’t have to,” said Orso. “Besides, there are plenty of\nladies about the palace, too.” He glanced at Hildi, doing her very best to\nlook fearless, and forced out a grin. “It would be most ungallant to ask them\nto sacrifice themselves. Further violence will achieve nothing anyway.” He\nthought again of the charming stretch of countryside he had transformed\ninto a mass grave and shook himself. “I’m not sure it ever does.”\n“You must not despair, Your Majesty!” Lord Hoff wrung his hands.\n“Thirty years ago, when your father was newly crowned, the city fell to the\nGurkish.”\n“A far more fearsome enemy than this rabble!” croaked Lord Marshal\nRucksted, whose appearance had degraded far past artfully rugged and into\nthe realm of total disarray.\n“Eaters, Your Majesty! Inside the Agriont. Inside the very palace.”\n“I remember my father telling me the story,” said Orso. He remembered\nhis mother looking enormously bored during it, too.\n“He never gave up!” Rucksted slapped fist into palm. “The Gurkish\nwere driven out! The Eaters vanquished! We can still—”\n“The Gurkish were driven out by my grandfather, Grand Duke Orso, and\nby Lord Marshal West and his loyal troops, freshly embarked from\nAngland.” Orso raised one brow. “My grandfather was killed long ago by\nthe Serpent of Talins, the Anglanders have rebelled against us already, and\nLord Marshal Forest is retreating eastwards, hard-pressed, with the few\nloyal troops that remain. We beat the Gurkish, but…” Orso waved a\nhelpless hand towards the crowds beyond the wall. “How can the Union\nbeat itself?”\nHoff stared about, mouth open, as if searching for a counterargument.\nOrso patted his fur-trimmed arm. He had never really liked the man, but he\nfelt sorry for him now. He, after all, loved the monarchy more than\nanything. Orso had never much cared for it.\n“As for the Eaters,” he went on, “it was the First of the Magi who dealt\nwith them, and he destroyed half the Agriont doing it. Bayaz is noticeable\nby his absence today. Even Master Sulfur appears to have pressing business\nelsewhere.” Orso looked towards the House of the Maker, rising stark and\nblack and decidedly unhelpful beyond the Agriont’s walls. “I fear the age of\nwizards is truly over. And one does wonder, after all, whether their price\nwas ever really worth paying.”\n“Then…” Lord Chancellor Gorodets hesitantly licked his lips. “What?”"

        "text": "wizards is truly over. And one does wonder, after all, whether their price\nwas ever really worth paying.”\n“Then…” Lord Chancellor Gorodets hesitantly licked his lips. “What?”\nThen what had been the question ever since Orso re-entered his capital\nand learned that the Breakers were converging upon it in countless\nmultitudes.\nThen what indeed.\nHe wormed a finger into his collar. Tried to loosen it without actually\nundoing the hook at his neck. It didn’t work, of course. That’s what the\nbloody hook’s there for.\nHe would have liked to ask Tunny for his opinion. No one had better\ninstincts for self-preservation, after all. But Tunny had, of course, followed\nthose very instincts and slipped away as the riots worsened. No tearful\ngoodbyes, he had simply not been there one morning. King who? Never\nheard of him. Orso had to smother an inappropriate snort of laughter at the\nthought. The corporal had never pretended that his first loyalty was to\nanyone other than himself.\nAnd the truth was, Orso knew very well what he had to do. It would just\nhave been nice to hear someone try to talk him out of it.\n“Bring out the king!” floating belligerently from below was the wisest\ncounsel on offer.\nOrso sighed. “Lord Hoff, I fear I must surrender myself to the\nBreakers.”\n“Your Majesty…” The lord chamberlain looked as pale as his own\nparticularly horrified ghost. “You cannot be serious—”\n“I can, and for once I am.” He glanced at the mayhem beyond the walls.\n“The time has come for someone to nobly sacrifice themselves. In the\nabsence of anyone better qualified… it will have to be me.”\nThe remaining worthies of the Closed Council shuffled down the steps\nafter him. Seven old men bent under the weight of their over-heavy robes,\nchains, responsibilities. They suddenly looked like a set of senile retirees\nbeing taken for a brief walk by their nurse.\n“Bring out the king!” A shrill shriek, then a bass growl. “Bring out the\nking!”\n“I’m bloody coming,” muttered Orso.\nThe palace gardens were crowded with memories. He had played hide\nand seek among those statues with his sisters. Playful little Carlot and\nserious little Cathil. Over there his father had taught him how to grip a steel.\nOver there his mother had taught him how to express intense displeasure\nwhile still smiling. They had never been the happiest of families but, by the\nFates, he missed them now he was the only one left.\n“Hildi,” he said, leaning towards her, “when the gates open, I need you\nto vanish.”\nThat sharp look of hers was exactly the same as when he first met her,\nten years old and tough as nails. “Thought you said the age of wizards was\nover?”\nHe smiled. Good to see she still wasn’t letting him get away with a\nthing. “I mean smear some dirt on those freckles, pull that cap down to your\neyes and melt into the crowd. You used to clean floors in a whorehouse, you\ncan fit in with this lot.”\n“I’m not leaving you.”\n“Of course not! You’re making a tactical withdrawal. If I come through"

        "text": "can fit in with this lot.”\n“I’m not leaving you.”\n“Of course not! You’re making a tactical withdrawal. If I come through\nthis, I’ll be a prisoner. I’m going to need someone loyal to help me escape.\nBake lockpicks into a cake or something.”\n“I’m not much of a baker.”\n“But I bet you know how to find one.”\n“I guess.” And she wiped her cheek on the back of her hand. He\nwondered whether she knew he was lying. Probably. Only the most\ncommitted optimist could imagine he would live out the hour, and neither\nof them qualified. “You still owe me money,” she grunted.\n“I’ll have to pay you back later,” said Orso, giving her shoulder a parting\npat. “Left my purse inside.”\nIf he lingered any longer he might think better of the whole thing, and\nright now they all needed to see some kingly composure. This would likely\nbe his last chance to show any, after all. It would be a shame to waste it. So\nhe straightened his jacket and crunched on across the gravel paths, so\nperfectly raked you would think no one had ever stepped on them before.\nNice to see that standards were still being maintained. He felt strangely\ncalm, now. As he had in Stoffenbeck, when the cannon-stones were raining\ndown around him.\nThe shouts outside the gate had resolved into a kind of chant. “Bring…\nout… the king! Bring… out… the king!” The rhythm was marked with\ncrashes of metal, with screams and laughter, with a stomping of boots, so\nmany and so hard they seemed to make the ground shake. “Bring… out…\nthe king!”\nHe wondered if there had been some choice he made, or didn’t. Some\nway to avoid this. If there had, it had passed without his even noticing.\nProbably he had been worrying about his mother, or the hook at his collar,\nor what people thought of him. He wished he had been a touch more\npurposeful. But people are what they are.\nHe puffed out his cheeks. “Open the gates, please, Colonel Gorst.”\nGorst only stared.\n“I understand,” said Orso gently. “And I release you from any and all\noaths. You are no longer my First Guard.”\nGorst’s eyes had a strangely lost expression. “What am I, then?”\n“I suppose… that’s up to you.” In the last few moments before they\nwere torn to pieces by the mob, anyway. “It’s time.”\nGorst swallowed, then turned and screeched, “Open the gates!”\nHowever often you heard that voice, you never quite got used to it.\nThe bars were lifted, the bolts were pulled and a slit of light showed\nbetween the great doors. The chanting fell silent as they swung open to\nreveal a row of staring faces. People stumbled, off balance, at the pressure\nfrom those behind. Orso faced them alone, head held high. King’s circlet on\nhis brow. Jewelled sword at his side. Cloak stitched with the golden sun of\nthe Union about his shoulders.

        "text": "the Union about his shoulders. A vision of majesty.\nThe rioters’ weapons drooped as he strode towards them. A couple went\nso far as to slip them behind their backs, as though vaguely embarrassed by\ntheir presence. In eerie silence Orso walked forward, his heart thudding but\nhis face kept carefully nonchalant, until he stood in the very archway. Close\nenough that if he, and they, had reached out, their fingers might have\ntouched.\n“Well?” he said, firmly and plainly. A little sternly, even. The voice of a\ndisappointed father. A tone his own father had often been called on to use.\n“Here I am.” His eyes came to rest on an elderly woman in a patched dress\nand stained apron, sleeves rolled up even in the cold to show heavy pink\nforearms. “Might I ask your business, madam?”\nShe snapped her open mouth shut and eased back, saying nothing.\nOrso raised one brow at a balding man with a faceful of broken veins\nand an old hatchet. “Might I enquire as to your purpose, sir?”\nHe glanced left and right, and his lower lip wobbled, and perhaps the\nfaintest croak emerged from his grizzled throat, but no more.\nOrso took a step forwards and the crowd shuffled away. Once, at a\nmeeting of the Solar Society Savine had persuaded him to attend, he had\nseen iron filings moved by magnetic repulsion. The effect was similar.\nThat tension in his throat was only getting worse. He worked his\nshoulders, suddenly annoyed at, of all things, the delay. “Come, come, let’s\nget to it!”\nBut rather than falling on him like hungry wolves, the silent mob parted,\nrevealing a man in a simple, dark suit of clothes. A hairless man, his face\nhideously burned, and at his side a hard-looking woman with a hard-\nlooking frown.\nOrso could only stare in amazement. “Arch Lector Pike?” he whispered.\n“I think we should consider this my formal resignation, Your Majesty.\nThough you see that, in truth, I have never been your servant.”\nPike was no captive of the crowd. By the way they treated him, he had\ntheir respect. Their obedience, even. By the Fates, he was their leader. The\nrealisation was almost a comfort. It seemed plain now that there was\nnothing he could have done. There had been a traitor beside him all along.\n“You’re the Weaver?” whispered Orso.\n“I have used the name at times.”\n“I never had an inkling.” Orso raised a brow at Teufel. “Did you have an\ninkling? You always struck me as the woman with all the inklings, if there’s\never been one.”\nTeufel’s eyes slid to Pike. “No,” she said, simply. Her feelings on the\nwhole business were, as ever, impossible to judge.\n“Well. I surrender the palace, I suppose. I ask that you show mercy to\nmy guards and retainers. They have only tried to serve me.”\n“There has been enough bloodshed,” said Pike, but added rather\nominously, “for today.”\nThere was a pause.

        "text": "ominously, “for today.”\nThere was a pause. Faint cheering was still coming from the direction of\nthe Square of Marshals. Angrier noises from the direction of the House of\nQuestions. But no one appeared to be hacking him to pieces on the spot.\n“So…” Orso rather awkwardly cleared his throat. “What happens now?”\n“The people will decide,” said Pike.\nOrso glanced about him. At the people. “Really?” He gave a puzzled\nsmile. “Are they equipped for that?”\nAll the Cards\nA\nwind blew through the tall windows of Skarling’s Hall, chilly with mist\nfrom the river. It shook the trees across the valley, made the hanging over\nthe great fireplace, stitched with the design of the Long Eye, flap and rustle.\nRikke drew her cloak tight around her, and huddled into her hood, and\nwatched the grey water churning, far below, and thought about what had to\nbe done.\nYou have to be hard to sit in Skarling’s Chair. Have to be. Whether you\nwant to be or not.\n“Thinking o’ jumping?” asked Isern.\n“It’s where the Bloody-Nine fell. Or so I hear.”\n“So what’s the lesson? Folk who scramble to power up a hill of corpses\nwill always take the long drop down?”\nRikke peered down that long drop, then took a cautious step away from\nthe window. “Not sure I like that lesson.”\nIsern grinned, tongue wedged into the hole in her teeth. “If you only\nlisten to lessons you like you’ll learn nothing. Nice fur you got there.”\n“Ain’t it?” And Rikke rubbed her hand against it, fine and white and so\nvery soft, stitched onto that red cloth Savine dan Brock gave her, to make a\ncloak fit for a queen of legend. “A gift from the people of Carleon.”\n“Warming to you, are they?”\n“I’ve always been very lovable.”\n“Specially with a few hundred armed men at your command.”\n“I find the better armed they are the more lovable I get. Reckon the\ntownsfolk are grateful I haven’t burned the city yet. Seems mercy can work\nafter all.”\n“No doubt it has its season,” said Isern. “And no doubt folk have a yen\nfor it, after Stour’s dark moods and mean spirit. But don’t get cocky, girl.\nGratitude is like spring blooms, fine-smelling but short-lived. I’d keep a\ntorch burning, d’you see, somewhere it brings to mind cities aflame. Make\nsure they stay grateful.”\n“Maybe they’ll get you a fur, too.”\n“I’ve no use for one.” Isern gave a haughty sniff and whipped a shred of\nher ragged shawl over one shoulder. “Perfection cannot be improved upon.”\nOne of the great doors clattered open and Corleth burst in, got the haft of\nthe axe at her belt tangled with her knees and near fell over, took a couple\nmore slapping steps then stood, hands on her thighs, panting for breath.\n“Interesting.” Isern pointed a tattooed finger at her. “This woman is\nusually quite calm in her manner.”\nCorleth waved towards the door. “They’re coming!”\n“Who’s coming?” asked Isern.\n“All of ’em.”"

        "text": "usually quite calm in her manner.”\nCorleth waved towards the door. “They’re coming!”\n“Who’s coming?” asked Isern.\n“All of ’em.”\nRikke could hear the commotion now. A crowd of gabbling voices,\nhappy and angry at once. The warrior’s favourite mood. She shoved her\nhood back and scrubbed some life into her flattened hair with her\nfingernails, heart suddenly pounding. “They’ve got him?”\nCorleth nodded. “They’ve got him.”\nSomeone sent the other door shuddering open with a kick and a pack of\nwarriors tramped into Skarling’s Hall, laughing and jostling and glowing\nwith triumph. Shivers led the way, with a bottle of spirits that’d seen some\naction, and Jonas Clover, with a shifty lad and a blank-faced woman at his\nback. The Nail and some big bearded bastard were dragging a filthy, half-\nnaked prisoner by his arms, head hanging and legs trailing limp behind him.\n“By the dead,” muttered Rikke. The last time she’d seen the King of the\nNorthmen outside of her dreams of vengeance had been at her father’s\nfuneral, sleek as a snake and every bit as vicious. “Time has not been kind\nto him.”\n“Time’s kind to no one,” said Shivers, pressing the bottle into her limp\nhand.\nThey flung him down in front of the dais Skarling’s Chair was set on. So\nRikke stood over him. Stood in judgement, where he’d stood over so many\nothers, the stones he lay on stained with the blood he’d ordered spilled.\n“Welcome back to your throne room, Great Wolf,” she said, and took a\nlong pull at the bottle, and winced as it burned right down her gullet, while\nher warriors strove manfully to out-gloat each other.\nStour tried to push himself up, arms trembling, making a blubbing\nwhimper all the way. Then Hardbread stepped up and kicked him in the\nguts, and knocked him flat again.\n“Grovel, you fucker!” he spat. Harsher than Rikke was used to from her\nfather’s old white-haired War Chief, but men’s mercy often runs out the\nvery moment they’re called upon to use it.\n“What’s wrong with his legs?” she asked.\n“Didn’t want him running off.” Shivers shrugged. “Slit the tendons\nbehind his knees.”\nIsern stuck her bottom lip out approvingly. “That’ll do it. Here’s where\ncocky gets you.” And she gave Rikke a meaningful glance from under her\nbrows.\nStour managed to get as far as his knees this time but looking like he\nmight fall any moment. Rikke hardly knew him, his nose was so broke and\nhis mouth so bloated and his cheeks so scabbed and swollen. Kept licking at\nhis bloody top lip with this little slurp. He stared about like he didn’t\nrecognise the place, one of his eyes near swollen shut and the other with a\ngreat red stain on the white. Rikke found she was rubbing gently at her own\nblind eye and had to force her hand away from it.\n“You took Carleon,” croaked Stour. Even his voice sounded broken.\nGloating felt like something of an effort, but folk were expecting it."

Even his voice sounded broken.\nGloating felt like something of an effort, but folk were expecting it.\n“Aye, well,” said Rikke, “Leo’s little jaunt to the Union seemed like more\nof a boy’s trip. Thought I’d invite King Orso to join you while I stayed here.\nMake better use o’ my time. Got me a new chair out of it.” Her warriors\nlaughed, but Stour was in no state to appreciate a joke.\n“My father alive?” he whispered.\n“For now,” said Isern. “Hiding away in the High Valleys.”\nStour hung his head. “He’d give anything… to get me back.” Something\ndripped on the floor. Bastard was crying. To suffer bravely takes practice,\nand he’d never had any. “I’m the future o’ the North,” he mumbled, like\neven he could hardly believe it might ever have been true. No matter how\nmuch pride a man has, it don’t take much, in the end, to beat it all out of\nhim. To make him want nothing but for the beating to stop. “Please.”\nRikke had a real bruiser of a speech all worked out, about the wrongs\nhe’d done the North and the price he’d have to pay and how we all build\nour own gallows and he was about to hang from his and blah, blah, fucking\nblah. She’d been polishing it up for days like a champion might his feast-\nday helmet. But she felt no joy in crowing over such a broken thing as this.\nShe took another pull on the bottle and nearly gagged on it.\n“Please.” Stour’s scabbed fingers crept across the floor and plucked at\nthe gold-embroidered hem of her new cloak. “Please.”\nBy the dead, he stank. When he fought Leo in the Circle she’d felt her\nhatred for him had no bottom. Now the well ran suddenly dry and all she\nhad left was disgust for the whole business. But she knew what the lads\nwanted to see. You have to make of your heart a stone, if you want to sit in\nSkarling’s Chair.\n“You dare touch me?” she barked and kicked him in the face. Since he\nwas on his knees she caught him right under the jaw, snapped his head up\nand sent him sprawling over backwards.\n“I’m sorry,” he whispered, curling up on his side, broken hand trembling\nover his bloody face. “Don’t hurt me.”\nThis hadn’t been the plan. In the plan he’d stood up, for one thing, and\nsneered and spat insults, and she’d burned bright with righteous fury and\ncut him down with the cleverest stuff you ever heard. But how can you cut\ndown what already can’t stand?\nShe curled her lip and looked over at the Nail. “You want to put him in\nthe cage?”\n“The one he put my father in?”\n“Have I got another?”\nHe grinned, and a fine grin he had. She was quite pleased to have it\naimed at her. Then he caught Stour by the hair and dragged him whimpering\nover towards the cage, his ruined legs flopping after.\n“Not killing him?” asked Clover, the slightest frown about his grey-"

My father once said that if he ever needed a dependable\nman… it wouldn’t be you.”\n“Your father was a straight edge and a fine judge of character.” Clover\ngave a little shrug. “In my humble opinion, it’d be a mistake to trust anyone\ntoo much.”\n“Specially someone already betrayed one master,” said Isern, cutting\nanother little piece of chagga from the lump and rolling it into a pellet.\n“Don’t be too generous to me, Isern-i-Phail, I’ve betrayed about five o’\nthe bastards.” And Clover nabbed the pellet from Isern’s fingers with\nsurprising dexterity and squinted to the rafters as he stuck it behind his lip,\nas though bringing to mind the full catalogue of his faithlessness was quite\nthe challenge. “There was Bethod, and Glama Golden, and Cairm Ironhead,\nand I reckon I betrayed Black Calder at the same time as I betrayed his son.\nWouldn’t be surprised if there’s one or two I’ve forgotten about besides.”\nAnd he patted thoughtfully at his belly. “I don’t think I flatter myself to say\nI’ve betrayed some o’ the greatest names in the North. But the thing they\nhad in common?”\n“Do tell,” said Rikke, offering him the bottle.\n“They made it stupid for me not to betray ’em. I’m hoping you’ll be\ncraftier.” And he slid something from an inside pocket. A golden chain of\nweighty links, its dangling diamond sparkling in the light from the tall\nwindows. The one she’d seen Scale Ironhand wear at the duel. The one\nshe’d seen Stour Nightfall wear at her father’s funeral. The chain Bethod\nhad forged, before she was born, when he forced the North together with\nfire and sword. “Guess this should come to you now.”\n“You keep it,” said Rikke.\nClover’s brows shot up. “Me?”\nIsern’s shot up, too. “Him?”\n“Bethod wore it, and Scale, and Stour. Look how things turned out for\nthem. Look how they turned out for the North. Don’t think it’ll suit me.”\nRikke hooked a thumb into her necklace of green stones and dragged them\ngently around her neck. “Reckon we’ve had enough kings for now.”"

Set the stone in your eating knife.\nConsider it a fair price for bringing me its owner.”\n“Then I will.” Clover tucked the chain back into his pocket. “You are as\nwise as you are generous, Chief.”\n“I wouldn’t count too much on either one,” she said, narrowing her eyes.\n“What happened over in the Union?”\n“I didn’t hang around for the outcome.” Clover took a swig from the\nbottle, daintily wiped the neck, then handed it to Isern. “There was quite the\nbattle going on and I do my best to avoid ’em. From what I could tell, Orso\nwon.”\nRikke found she was rather pleased about that. And not only ’cause\nshe’d betrayed the other side and victory for the Young Lion could’ve put\nher in quite the awkward spot. Never took much to make her thoughts\nwander back to the palace in Adua, morning sun streaming through the\nwindows. Time had softened the smashing headache she’d been nursing.\nShe remembered Orso coming through the door, grin on his face, tray in his\nhand. I brought you an egg. He hadn’t struck her as a winner of battles, it\nhad to be said. But then neither had she, and here she was with Skarling’s\nHall for her living room.\nThere was a clang as the Nail flung the cage door shut on Stour and left\nhim huddled, filthy back pressed against the bars and one hand dangling\nbetween them. “Looks like we hold all the cards.”\n“You’ve still got to play ’em right,” said Clover, frowning over at the\nremnants of the Great Wolf.\n“Carleon’s ours,” said Shivers.\n“And half the North besides,” crowed Hardbread, “and Nightfall’s men\nare trickling back wounded and ruined and Black Calder hasn’t much left to\nfight with, I reckon.”\n“We should hit him now,” said the Nail. “Hit him hard.”\n“Calder’s weak!” growled the big man with all the beard.\n“Calder’s canny,” said Isern. “No doubt he’ll have spies here.”\nStour was one kind of enemy. He’d come right at you. Black Calder was\nanother. “Doubt he’s halfway as weak as he seems,” said Rikke. “He’s still\ngot friends, and he’ll already be gathering ’em.”\n“And the year’s getting late,” said Shivers, nodding towards the white\nsky outside the windows.\n“We need to bring him to us.” Rikke dropped into Skarling’s Chair and\nslung her leg over one of the arms, trying to look right at home, though the\ndead knew there was no getting comfortable in that bloody thing. “Fight\nhim on the ground we choose at the time we choose.”\n“How you figuring to do that?” asked Hardbread.\n“I already know how.” Rikke put a fingertip to her tattooed cheek and\ngave Shivers a big wink with her Long Eye. “I’ve seen it.”\nNo one laughed at that these days.

Fearful glances and\nnervous shiftings from one foot to another. These Named Men, killers all,\nstanding in awe of Skinny Rikke and her Long Eye. A year ago she’d\nhidden from Stour Nightfall in a freezing stream. Now she had him locked\nin his own cage. She who used to have fits and shit herself in the streets of\nUffrith had stolen half the North. Was enough to make her burst out\nlaughing, almost. But that would’ve spoiled the mood.\n“Patience,” she said, softly, tapping at the peeled paint on the arm of\nSkarling’s Chair with her fingernail. “We need to chew what we’ve bit\nbefore we bite off more. While you boys were having fun on the way from\nUffrith there’s been work to do up here.”\n“I’m always ready to work,” said Shivers.\n“We’ve been laying in food for the winter, and I’ve a sense folk in the\nnext valley are holding out on us. Might be…” She glanced sideways at\nIsern. “I’ve been too soft-hearted with ’em.

And take Hardbread with you, since he’s in\nsuch a bloodthirsty mood.”\n“Right y’are.” And Shivers beckoned Hardbread and a few others after\nhim as he headed for the door.\n“Clover?”\n“Rikke?”\n“Take your people up to the Redwater Valley. Calder’s boys’ve been\nbusy over there. Burned a few farms. Make it clear this side of the river’s\nmine.”\n“Right back into the cold.” Clover aimed a wistful sigh at the fire. “We’d\nbe honoured, wouldn’t we, Sholla?”\nThe blank-faced girl looked blank as ever. “Inexpressibly.”\nRikke beckoned Corleth over as Clover and his people tramped out.\n“Get some water boiled and clean that bastard in the cage, eh?”\n“Kindness?” she asked.\n“On my nose. He fucking stinks.”\n“I still reckon the moon would smile upon him face down in the mud.”\nIsern prodded at the bars with one blue finger, making the cage turn gently,\nthe Great Wolf limp as a heap of filthy rags inside. “Remember when he\nchased us through the woods, all cold and hungry and gnat-nibbled?\nRemember how bitter your feelings then?”\n“I’m not forgetting,” said Rikke.\n“He said he’d send your guts to your father in a box. Break what they\nlove, he said.”\n“I’m not forgetting. But we might yet find a use for him.”\n“I’ll admit he makes a fine adornment. Caged in the very cage he had"

I want to hit once, and that so hard I never have to\nhit again.”\n“Thought your father swore to see Black Calder back to the mud?”\n“So they say, but my father didn’t think much o’ vengeance, and since\nhe’s dead into the bargain I feel sure he can wait a spell.”\nThe Nail gave a little grin, tip of his tongue stuck between his teeth.\n“You’re a clever one, ain’t you?”\n“I do my humble best.” And Rikke realised she was threading her chain\nof emeralds through her fingers, feeling the cool stones tickle at the webs\nbetween them.\nShe gave the Nail a considering look. You could not have called him\npretty, slouched long and loose against the wall with his thumbs in his belt\nand his elbows stuck out and his chin stuck forward. But then Rikke\ndoubted pretty was the first word anyone would’ve picked for her these\ndays. And there was something about him. All calm, and confident, and in\nno hurry. Like he was happy in his own skin, the very thing she’d never\nbeen. We’re always drawn to our opposites. Drawn to them and scared by\nthem at once. And where’s the fun in someone who don’t scare you just a\ntouch?\nShe got up and walked over, taking one more swallow from the bottle.\nTasted worse than ever, mixed with chagga bitterness, but it wasn’t burning\nany more. Just glowing nicely, like the embers in the great fireplace.\n“What do your friends call you?” asked Rikke, handing him the bottle.\nHe frowned at the little dribble in the bottom, more spit than spirits.\n“The Nail.”\n“Aye, but folk who are close.”\nHe took a swig of his own, watching her all the way. “Don’t have\nanyone that close. Not now my da’s dead.”\n“What did he call you?”\nA pause. “The Nail.”\n“Can I borrow that cloak o’ yours?”\nHe raised those pale blond brows, and undid the buckle, and tossed it"

She wandered to the corner of the hall, taking her time. Felt\ntense in there, like there was something about to happen, and she enjoyed it.\nShe reckoned she’d earned just a streak of cockiness, whatever Isern said.\nShe went up on her tiptoes to hang the cloak over Stour’s cage.\n“Don’t really want him looking.” And she bent down and pulled one of\nher boots off, left it lying. Kicked the other off into the corner, and it\nbounced from the wall and fell on its side.\nThe Nail frowned over at it. “Why you taking your boots off?”\nShe undid her belt buckle. “’Cause I can’t get my trousers off over ’em.”\nThat was when she realised, skirts have many downsides but you can\nstep right out of the bastards. Or pull ’em up in a pinch. But there’s no slick\nway out of trousers. She got ’em down past her knees all right, then nearly\nfell over pulling her right foot free, and had to hop along dragging the other\nleg off.\nNot quite the sultry swagger she’d planned. Maybe she’d got too cocky\nafter all. But there was nothing for it now but to see it through. She\nwriggled into Skarling’s Chair, trying to arrange her fine new cloak in a\nmanner that preserved the delicate balance between too much mystery and\nnot enough.\nThe Nail considered this performance, then Stour’s covered cage, then\nscratched the back of his head. “Fair to say the afternoon has took an\nunexpected turn.”\nA brief silence. Outside, the river thundered. Bad idea, this. One of her\nworst. She wondered where her trousers ended up, and how far the\nshameful shuffle would be to squirm back into ’em so she could pretend it\nnever happened. “Not planning on turning me down, are you? ’Cause that’d\nbe quite an embarrassment.”\n“Fuck, no.” And he cracked out a grin. “Just thought I’d fix the scene in\nmy mind, while I’ve got the chance.” He tapped the side of his head with\nthe bottle. “It’s a good one.” Then he sucked the last drops from it and\nwalked over, undoing his sword-belt on the way and kicking it off. Which\nwas a hell of a relief, ’cause apart from anything else the chill breeze\nthrough the window was spreading gooseflesh up her thighs.\n“It don’t bother you?” He planted one big boot between her bare feet,\nthen glanced over towards the cage in the corner, creaking slightly, with his\ncloak over it. “Knowing he’s under there?”\n“It’s half the point. He once said he’d see me fucked by dogs.”\nThe Nail planted his other boot beside the first. “That was rude.”\n“Now he’ll learn I decide who gets fucked and how.”\n“So… you’re using me to teach him a lesson?”\nShe turned her head and spat out the chagga pellet. “I guess.”\nHe gave a little giggle. “Grand.” And he tossed the empty bottle out of"

A delicate, polite little kiss, it was, catching her top lip\nbetween both of his, and then her bottom lip. So delicate and polite she\nalmost laughed.\nKissing’s a simple thing in a way, but everyone’s got their own style at\nit, like talking, like walking, like fighting, like writing. He kept on kissing\nher, one lip, then the other, and she had to stretch up to kiss him back, to\nmake the kisses a little deeper, to get the point of her tongue involved, and\nnow she didn’t feel like laughing any more, not at all. She slid her hands\nalong the scarred arms of Skarling’s Chair till they slid onto his, till she was\ngripping his wrists, till his knees were rubbing against the insides of her\nbare thighs, just gently, like there was nothing much in it, but to her mind\nthere was quite a lot in it, actually.\nHe had his eyes open all the time, looking at her, and she had hers open\nall the time, looking at him—well, the one that worked—and that felt\ndangerous, somehow, like each little kiss was a risk. She craned up to kiss\nhim harder but he moved his face away so she couldn’t quite get there, and\nshe found she’d made an excited little gasp and he’d made a satisfied little\ngrunt and the breath between them was hot and smelled of spirits. Good\nidea, this. One of her best.\nShe’d got his belt undone with one hand, rather pleased about her\nnimble fingers, and now she slipped them inside and dug around till she\nbrought his cock out, halfway hard and definitely going in the right\ndirection. She wouldn’t say she was drunk but she was on the road there,\nrubbing at him with one hand, fingers of the other around the back of his\nneck, scratching at his red-blond beard with her thumbnail.\n“I’m going to need your help with something,” she whispered.\n“Not sure… how I can show more willing—”\n“Not that. Well, yes, that. But something else, too. Doubt you’ll like it.”\n“You pick a hell—ah—of a time to ask for—ah—a favour,” he\nwhispered, nudging at her lips with his.\n“They say you should always bargain from a position of strength.”\n“That so?”\nHer turn to gasp as he pushed his hands under her arse, knelt down and\npulled her towards him so her head slid down the chair back and her back\nslid down the chair seat and she was left lying half on it and half off it, her\nbare toes on the cold stone and her knees spread around his head and her\nhips pushed up towards him, the warmth of the fire on the side of her bare\nleg and the cold breeze from the window tickling her bare belly. She\nsquirmed this way and that, couldn’t find anything close to comfortable\namong the unforgiving angles. You have to be hard, after all, to sit in\nSkarling’s Chair.

Felt\nlike all she’d done since the People’s Army arrived in Adua was shout. Her\nthroat was raw from it. In the new Union, you got nothing done talking\nquietly.\nA faint voice echoed from beyond the monstrous, studded doors in the\ntowering, spike-topped wall of that fortress of a bank. “I can hear you.”\n“I’m Inquisitor—” She ground her teeth. “I’m Chief Inspector Teufel! I\nhave a warrant signed by Commissioner Pike to search any and all branches\nof the Banking House of Valint and Balk.” She held the document high,\nthough how the hell anyone was supposed to tell whether it was genuine or\nnot, she’d no idea. Everything had to be printed now, but they’d smashed all\nthe good presses the day the Agriont fell so the warrant was all smudged,\nthe seal was a blob and the signature a blur. “It’d be a lot easier to have this\nconversation if you opened the door!” And her voice died away entirely on\nthe last word.\n“I don’t have the authority to open the door, Inspector.”\nA curious crowd was gathering in front of the bank. These days, crowds\nbuilt up at the slightest provocation. Risinau insisted they be allowed to.\nThey had to promote the national conversation, he said. They had to\npoliticise the masses, he said. Risinau said a lot, but as far as Vick could tell\nnone of it ever meant anything. The masses were far too politicised for her\ntaste already.\n“Who does have the authority?” she barked. A question people were\noften asking, in the new Union.\nShe had to strain to hear the reply. “The manager.”\n“So where’s he?”\nA pause. “Not here.”\nVick was out of patience. She’d a lot less patience than she used to, one\nway or another. “Get the cannon,” she snapped.\nThere was an excited murmur from the onlookers as the Practicals\ngathered around the wagon. They were calling them Constables now, but\nyou could still see the tan lines on their faces where their masks used to sit.\nVick planted her hands on her hips and tapped one finger impatiently as she\nwatched them strain at the spokes of its wheels, spit flying from their\nclenched teeth as it ground ever so slowly over the cobbles. When she\nwasn’t shouting, she was tapping her finger impatiently.\nTallow watched the whole business while blowing into his cupped hands\nwith his usual air of hangdog resignation. “So… we’re not the Inquisition\nany more?”\nShe was damn glad he was alive but she didn’t let a trace of it show.\nOnly growled back as impatiently as ever. “Commissioner Pike felt the\nname gave the wrong signals.”\n“Six centuries of torture, exile and hangings, you mean?”"

But someone still needs to keep folk in line.” One of the\nConstables slipped and fell, the wagon rocking back alarmingly. “Even if\nthe line’s turned blurry as hell.”\n“Who better’n the folk who used to do it, I guess?”\n“You can’t say we don’t have the relevant experience.”\n“So… the same people, doing the same job, but called something else?”\n“You may have hit closer to the essence of the Great Change than\nChairman Risinau has in a hundred hours of speeches. Welcome to the new\nUnion and its People’s Inspectorate, headquarters at the House of Truth. It’s\nthe big building in the Agriont with the little windows, in case you were\nwondering.”\n“They’re not asking questions there any more?”\n“Oh, they’re asking questions.”\n“Just… nicely?”\n“I doubt it.”\n“But truth is more important than it used to be?”\n“Time will tell.” Though Vick had her doubts about that, too.\n“I hear the People’s Army let out all the prisoners.”\n“Some of whom I worked hard to put in there. Most of whom weren’t\neven Breakers. Thieves, smugglers, more than one murderer and an idiot\nwho liked to set fires. Not to mention the Young Lion and his co-\nconspirators. You’re all free, Brothers! Did they let your sister out?”\n“They did.”\n“Good.” She regretted saying it right away. New Union or old, letting a\nfeeling show was like pointing out a chink in your armour. An invitation to\nstick the knife in. She frowned sideways at Tallow. With his sister released,\nhe’d no real reason to work with her. Still less to be loyal to her. “You’re\nstill here, though, I notice.”\n“I’m standing with the winners.” He gave her a weak grin. “And where\nelse would I go?”\n“Fair point.” What with all the folk who’d flooded into Adua with the\nPeople’s Armies, and the mills and manufactories that were shut up or\nbroken down, and the shambles on the roads, canals and docks, work was\nhard to come by and prices were higher than ever. And who knew where\nanyone’s loyalties sat these days? Old friends were set at odds and old\nenemies made allies. In the new Union, everything was ripped up and spun\naround, and who was to say it wouldn’t be ripped up fresh tomorrow?\n“You got a uniform, at least,” said Tallow.\nVick frowned down at herself. Bloody thing was too tight under the\narmpits and the boots pinched. “Seems black never goes out of fashion.”\n“Looks good on you. Very fearsome.”\n“I guess this has all been worthwhile, then.” It was hard to point out\nmuch else the Great Change had achieved so far. No doubt some folk had\ngained and some folk lost, but that better world she’d let herself hope was\ncoming felt as far away as ever.\nThe Constables had finally heaved the wagon into position, maw of the\ncannon pointing at the bank’s doors.

She leaned towards their leader, a big-\nshouldered bastard so acne-scarred he’d probably looked less frightening\nwhen they still wore masks. “This bloody thing loaded?”\n“I’ve got shot,” he said, “but there’s no powder to be had.”\nAll shot and no powder summed it right up. She’d just have to blow the\ndoor down with lies, like usual. “Get the match-cord lit at least, make it\nlook like we think the damn thing works.” She cleared her sore throat and\nturned back to the bank. “Can you hear me in there?”\n“I can hear you.”\n“Can you see me?”\nA pause. A tiny slot slid open in one of the doors. “I can see you,” came\nconsiderably louder from the opening.\nVick ground her teeth again. They were going to be down to the gums\nby the time this door was open. “Then why didn’t you open the bloody slot\nbefore?”\nNo answer.\n“You see we’ve got a cannon pointed at you.”\nNo answer.\n“I’ll take that as a yes.” There was a puff of sparks as one of the\nConstables finally got the match-cord to splutter into life, and some of their\ngrowing audience took nervous steps away. “I’m going to count down from\nten. If this door isn’t open when I get to nothing, I’m going to open it the\nhard way.”\nNo answer, but she thought she saw a pair of eyes behind the slot blink.\n“Anything within twenty strides of that door’ll get opened the hard way,\ntoo.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“You,” said Vick. “You’ll be open. You’ll all be wide fucking open.”\n“Perhaps we could—”\n“Ten.”\nThere was a clattering of keys, a rattling of bolts, one half of the double\ndoors opened and a balding head stuck around it into the chill autumn air.\n“We surrender,” it said.\nVick looked over at the lead Constable. Something she would rather\nhave done as little as possible. “Well, then?”\n“Oh. Right.” And he pulled out his stick and stomped forwards,\nbeckoning the others after him.\n“Why’s the Commissioner so interested in banks, anyway?” muttered\nTallow. “Why not, I don’t know, the armouries, or the barracks, or the\ngranaries?”\n“Daresay we’ll get to those.”\n“But why banks first?”\nWhen Arch Lector Glokta was in charge, Vick had found it helped not to\nwaste too much thought on the whys. She guessed the same applied to\nCommissioner Pike. Probably it applied double. So she just shrugged.\n“Better raiding bankers than Breakers, I guess,” said Tallow.\n“Is it?”\n“On the right side of history, maybe.”\nVick snorted. “The thing about history is you don’t know what the right\nside is till long afterwards, and by then it hardly matters.”\n“That’s the sort o’ thing you hear from folk who know they’re on the\nwrong side.”\nVick conceded the point with a weary grunt. “I daresay.”\n“Safe!” bellowed the Constable from inside and, with care, Vick stepped"

They looked like a set of very scared clerks with a cannon pointing\nat them. Vick picked out the best dressed. A balding man trying to hide\nbehind the others.\n“You’re in charge?” she asked.\n“Well…” He glanced about nervously, but no one fell over themselves to\ntake responsibility. “I suppose I am the longest serving member of staff on\nsite. I am Ario Matterno, senior over-clerk for loans—”\n“Styrian?”\n“Is that…” he swallowed. “A problem?”\n“Not for me.” Vick was keenly aware that most of the considerable harm\ndone to her in her life had been by her own countrymen, but foreigners were\nnot popular with the mobs. A few days before, a dozen Gurkish immigrants\nhad been burned as spies in the Three Farms. Being too dark or too fair or\ntoo rich or too poor or too mad or too sane was a bad idea in the new Union.\nFreedom did not seem to have made anyone any less angry. But then the\nprice of bread kept going up, and Chairman Risinau’s oratory wasn’t edible.\n“The vault’s this way?” Vick started walking. Matterno managed to keep\npace with her while hurrying along sideways, rubbing his hands. “Inquisitor\n—”\n“Inspector,” corrected Tallow.\n“Sorry, yes, so many changes to keep track of… are you really sure you\nwant to do this?”\n“It’s not a question of what I want to do.” Vick wasn’t sure it had ever in\nher life been a question of that. “Commissioner Pike has ordered every\nbranch of Valint and Balk shut down. At once.”\nThe man looked baffled. As though Commissioner Pike had ordered\nwater to flow upwards. “But… it’s Valint and Balk. You can’t do that.”\n“You didn’t see the cannon?”\nHe tried to explain it again. “The Banking House is owed money\neverywhere. Everywhere. So many, many friends, here in the Union and\nabroad. It would be very unwise… it would be utter madness—”\n“Have you been outside lately? Wisdom is not at a premium, madness is\nthe fashion, the balance sheets are all torn up and the friends that were\nassets have become liabilities.” Vick kept walking. “Threats for tomorrow\ndon’t cut very deep when today is so damn threatening. You might want to\nkeep ’em to yourself.”\nIt felt cold in the banking hall. Colder than outside, almost. Vick had to\nresist the urge to put her feet down softly on account of the volley of echoes\nproduced by every step. The place was high as a Gurkish temple, carved\nfrom dark marble and dark wood, gilt glittering in shafts of dusty light from\nthe high windows. There were little islands of expensive chairs where\nsupplicants would wait to receive the bank’s blessing, or to hear their\nschemes ripped to tatters, but no business was being done today.

The only\nmerchants in attendance were marble busts of history’s richest men,\nfrowning greedily at them from the past.\n“Now that is a door,” said Tallow.\nIt was the door to end all doors, taking up most of the far wall and\ntowering over the room, an expanse of black iron with the weighty names\nValint and Balk etched in gold in the centre. Down near the bottom was a\nbrass wheel like the wheel of a ship, a tiny-looking lock to either side.\nTallow gazed up at it, open-mouthed. “I’m guessing that’s the vault?”\n“It’d be a fancy door for the kitchen.” Vick waved some of the\nConstables out into the room and they began to drag drawers from desks,\nroot through papers, throw things around in that slightly disinterested way\nthey had.\n“Shouldn’t it be hidden?” asked Tallow. “Underground or something?”\n“The whole point is that no one who comes in can miss it. They all have\nto imagine how much money sits behind a door as big as that. How much\npower.” She nodded Matterno towards the brass wheel. “Open it.”\nThe senior over-clerk for loans spoke in a very small voice. “I don’t\nhave the authority, Inspector.”\nVick planted her hands on her hips again. “Don’t make me wheel that\nbloody cannon in here.”\n“It’s a two-foot thickness of Angland steel. You’ll barely scratch it with\na cannon.”\nVick looked him right in the eye. “It’s you I was going to point it at.”\nMatterno swallowed, and slipped a key from his pocket, and offered it\nout. A very long, thin, delicate key for such an immensity of door, wards so\ncomplex they looked like a tiny maze. “I only have one. You need the\nother.”\n“Don’t tell me. The manager has it.”\nEver so slowly, Matterno spread his palms. “I… think?”\n“Arrest him,” said Vick. “And the others. Seal this place up.”\n“But… Inspector!” Two Constables caught the disbelieving senior over-\nclerk for loans under the armpits and started manhandling him away. “It’s\nValint and Balk!”\n“You can explain it to Commissioner Pike!” Vick called after him. “Get\nthem all to the House of Questions.”\n“House of Truth,” corrected Tallow.\n“Whatever.” She winced as she rubbed at her stiff hip. Damn thing\nalways started niggling as the weather turned colder. “Lots of empty cells\nup there these days.”\n“Aye.” Tallow gave a faraway sigh. “I suppose it’s high time we filled\n’em up again.”\nCitizens\n“T\nhe deeper question…” Risinau sank back, the ornate chair that was\nonce Orso’s creaking under his bulk, to consider the gilded dome above. “Is\nwhat are we now?”\nOrso considered that one of the best questions of recent times.

They called it the Commons’ Round now, though.\nThey’d turned the cushions over so the embroidered suns of the Union\ndidn’t show, and the unruly gathering who sat upon them was no longer the\nOpen Council, but the Assembly of Representatives.\nThere had been votes in the districts of Adua, apparently. Votes from\nevery Midderland-born man, no matter how mean and ignorant, resulting in\na body of representatives, as far as Orso could tell, every bit as mean and\nignorant as they were. Votes. He could only imagine his mother’s reaction\nto that. The tyranny of the majority. Representatives would be elected in\nother cities of the Union in due course, but those benches were still empty\nwhile the Assembly argued over the rules. They argued even more than the\nOpen Council had, if that was possible. They argued every point. They\nargued the order of the points. They argued the method of argument.\n“What are we?” one of Risinau’s cronies pronounced, with great\nemphasis. “Or… what should we be?” Everything was said with great\nemphasis. The most banal observations became profound revelations, tear-\ntracked protestations, chest-thumping declarations.\n“A republic?”\n“How?” Someone frowned towards Orso. He looked vaguely familiar.\nImpressive whiskers. “We still have a king.”\n“A regrettable state of affairs.” Orso could not tell who had said that.\nProbably everyone thought it. He had long been thinking it himself, after\nall. He was not at all sure why the Breakers had not done away with him on\nthe day of the Great Change. Perhaps they could not quite shrug off some\nvestige of deference to the monarch. Perhaps they thought his presence\nmight lend proceedings a patina of legitimacy. Perhaps they preferred him\nas a contemptible prop than a martyr to be avenged. More likely they feared\nto smash the past all in one go, and were holding him back for a spectacular\nfinale.\nWhatever the reasons, they had built an absurd little enclosure to contain\nthe royal person, halfway between a theatre box and a dock for the accused,\nsplattered in cheap gilt, already peeling. He felt like the ridiculous peacock\nsome Southern ambassador had once given his mother. She had kept it in a\nsilver cage as a curio for visitors. It had looked deeply unhappy, produced\nan astonishing quantity of dung and not lived very long.\nIt would have helped at least a little if all the old denizens of the Open\nCouncil had lost their places in the Great Change, but a smattering of\nOrso’s worst enemies had managed to cling to their seats. Lord Isher had\nslithered from hiding, Lord Heugen had slipped out of prison and the Young\nLion sat in the front row along with several other surviving aristocratic\nrebels. Those few noblemen who had stayed loyal to the Crown were\nlanguishing in cells beneath the House of Truth. The world was turned\nupside down, indeed.

Traitors were patriots, turncoats were loyalists,\ncorruption was purity and the truth a lie.\nAside from the reduced Lord Brock there were no delegates from\nAngland. Lady Finree was back in charge there, carefully considering her\noptions. Starikland was not represented, either. Lord Governor Skald had\ndenounced the Great Change and, if Orso knew his brother-in-law at all,\nwould even now be wondering how he could twist it to his advantage. The\nonly representatives from beyond the shores of Midderland were a few\nalarmed Aldermen of Westport, no doubt regretting their decision to remain\ninside the Union more with every passing day. Orso wondered absently if\nhe might get a message via them to his mother and sister in Sipani. Just to\nlet them know he was well. Reassuring lies had always been the glue that\nheld his family together, after all.\n“The Union is and has always been a monarchy,” came Risinau’s\nendlessly overemphasising voice. Chairman Risinau, he was calling\nhimself. Appropriate, for a man forever sitting down. “We must\nacknowledge the past even as we shape the future. But we are a new variety\nof monarchy and must devise new terminology!” Nothing pleased him more\nthan to tinker with terminology. The man was a positive manufactory of\nverbiage. “You might call it a representative, or perhaps a constitutional\nmonarchy…”\nAmong the newly elected there were labourers, merchants, printers,\nlens-makers, clock-makers, candle-makers, even a couple of maids and a\nbelligerent laundress, but also a disproportionate number of artists, poets\nand that most nebulous of designations: intellectuals. Risinau clearly\nconsidered himself to be artist, poet and intellectual combined, though in\nhis labyrinthine speeches Orso perceived little artistry, only the cheapest\nkind of poetry and no intellect whatsoever.\n“I have been considering a written constitution!” Whiskers, again,\nleaning over the parchments on the High Table, pen in inky hand. It finally\ncame to Orso who he was: Spillion Sworbreck, that bloody writer in whose\noffice he used to meet Savine. In spite of everything, the memory brought a\nrare smile to his face. “I was thinking something along the lines of… we\nconsider these facts to be self-evident—”\nThere was instant opposition from among the great thinkers. “What?\nNothing is self-evident!”\n“Pretentious! Presumptuous!”\n“Asking for trouble.”\n“Terrible first line.”\nThere was the scrape of a nib crossing out. “Thorny, isn’t it, once you\nstart drafting? Not at all like fiction.”\nJudge delivered one of her explosive snorts of scorn. She was draped\nover a chair with one bare foot up on the High Table, its dirty sole directed\nat the Chairman, her lip permanently twisted and her eyes forever narrowed.\nHer followers, the Burners, had taken to dyeing parts of their clothes red.\nYou could see a few of them on the benches. Red hats. Red sleeves. Red\ntrouser legs. As if they had been dipped in blood. Perhaps they had.\n“Let us skip over the first line for now.”\n“The first line? And already we’re skipping over?”"

And already we’re skipping over?”\n“Don’t writers always say you should write the first line last?”\n“Just the sort of bloody rubbish writers would say…”\nThis was the way of it. Business was steered by Risinau’s whims, or\nwhoever could shout loudest. Halfway through discussing one thing they’d\nbe dragged onto another. It was the most dispiriting display of\nmismanagement Orso had witnessed, indeed, since the last time he sat in\nthis room, before the Great Change. He leaned sideways, holding out his\ngoblet. “Don’t suppose you could fill me up again, Hildi?”\nThe day the Agriont fell she had melted into the crowd as ordered, then\nmelted straight back when he was not immediately torn to pieces. He had\nadmonished her sternly for her disobedience, but in truth was pathetically\ngrateful for this one undeserved shred of loyalty. They had confiscated her\nold cap—leading to a flood of swearing which had still not quite dried up—\nbut otherwise allowed her to stay in post, wearing an absurd livery. This\nwas typical of the new regime. Some things they furiously tore down.\nOthers they let stand, even tearfully celebrated. All without apparent pattern\nor purpose.\n“You sure?” she muttered through tight lips.\n“Worried they’ll take a dislike to my drinking? They took enough of a\ndislike to me already to overthrow the monarchy. They’ve given me wine.\nBad wine, but still. Might as well make use of it.”\nHis eyes met Corporal Tunny’s for a moment, slumped upon a bench\ntowards the back. It hurt Orso more than it should have, to see his old\nstandard-bearer seated among his enemies. But one can hardly expect paid\nhangers-on to keep hanging on after the pay dries up, and it could not be\ndenied that no one better represented the faithlessness, degradation and low\ncharacter of the commons than Corporal Tunny.\nSworbreck droned on. “If we accept, just for the time being, temporarily\nand reversibly, that we do consider these facts to be self-evident…” There\nwas an expectant pause. “Which facts should they be?”\n“Ah.” Risinau placed a finger on his lips and considered the dome once\nagain. “Well, that would be the deeper question.”\nOrso sank into his chair with a groan, letting his gaze wander lazily\nalong the front row. Only one man there met his eye. The Young Lion\nlooked neither young nor particularly leonine any more, his face hollowed\nout and lined with pain, beard scattered with still-healing scars on the left\nside, one of them dragging his mouth into a permanent half-frown.\nOrso raised his goblet in a silent toast. Why waste energy on hatred,\nafter all? The world in which they had been rivals had dropped into oblivion\nbeneath them like a sunken ship.

The tormenting itch in the butchered stump.\n“By the dead,” he mouthed, squirming in his seat.\nHe wanted to rip open his sewn-shut trouser leg and tear at the red\nwounds with his nails. Gnaw at the stitches like a wolf might at a leg caught\nin a trap. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to breathe, trying to listen, but\nhe could hardly follow a word. The crowd bellowed and warbled along with\nthe blood rushing in his ears, no more meaning in it than in a stormy sea.\nHe was a crippled shell. A tortured ghost. He’d never be himself again.\n“You all right?” asked Heugen.\nLeo got as near a smile as he could. A skull’s rictus. “Fine.” He’d never\nbeen much of a liar, but this must’ve been one of his very worst.\n“If I was in your position,” drawled Isher, “I’d be straight out of this\nmadhouse and back to Angland as fast as my legs could carry me.” He\nrealised his dire choice of words. “On the next tide, I mean to say.”\n“Savine’s due any day,” grunted Leo. “Be a while till she can make the\nvoyage.” Even speaking was painful. “But Commissioner Pike’s invited us\nto stay. Meaning we’re still prisoners. I think he’s got people watching us.”\n“He has people watching everyone with a ‘dan’ in their name,”\nmurmured Isher.\n“He has us watching each other.” Heugen glanced suspiciously about the\nsurrounding benches. “Better value for money.”\n“Gentlemen, if I may?” someone shouted.\n“Citizens!” someone roared back.\n“Citizens, of course, my profuse apologies!” The man looked terrified.\nThere was a feeling that little mistakes were being noted down and would\nsoon enough be counted against you. “I wished to speak of the walls! The\ncity walls, the walls of the Agriont. They are, practically speaking, an\nimpediment to the growth of the city. They are, symbolically, a reminder of\nmonarchist oppression.”\nIsher sprang up. The man could move fast, when he wanted to.\nScurrying from the Battle of Stoffenbeck, for instance. Or scurrying back,\nonce he saw something to gain.\n“They’re damn useful for the defence of the city, though!” Leo thought\nhe might be roughing up the clipped accent of the Midderland nobleman to\nsound more like a commoner. “There’ll be foreign enemies, jealous of our\nfreedoms. There’ll be enemies in the provinces, keen to take us back into\nthe past.” Isher pointed across at Orso, watching this performance with\nweary scorn. “There’ll be enemies among us, wanting to raise a king above\nour heads again.”\nThose who’ve snatched power always fear it’ll be snatched away. There\nwere murmurs of agreement, nods rippling through the benches. The public\ngallery was less enthusiastic, though. Not so much the message, Leo\nreckoned, as the messenger."

Not so much the message, Leo\nreckoned, as the messenger.\n“Aristocrats!” someone bellowed from above. “Clinging to aristocratic\nsymbols!” Insults were thrown down, and scraps of food, and crumpled\npamphlets, and the king acknowledged them by raising his goblet and\ntaking a lazy swallow.\n“What does the Young Lion say?”\n“Let’s hear from Brock!”\nRisinau banged on the table for order and Leo flinched. The sound made\nhim think of the cannon blast in Stoffenbeck. The shattered Guildhall. His\nhorse falling across him. Antaup with bloody hands in his lap. Jin riddled\nwith flatbow bolts.\nHe tried to wipe his face, greasy with cold sweat.\n“You should say something,” muttered Isher, frowning up towards the\njeering gallery.\nThe thought of standing terrified him, but there must still have been\nsome stubborn remnant of the Young Lion, hidden deep inside. Better to do\nit, than live with the fear of it, the Dogman used to say. Leo might have lost\na leg and an arm, but he’d show these bastards he still had his heart.\nHeugen hauled him up while Isher wedged his crutch under his arm.\nThen they sat back, applauding his pluck. Not the man he was—he’ll never\nbe the man he was—but the crippled curiosity can still raise a cheer or two.\nLeg trembling, stump burning, Leo drew himself up, raised his chin,\nbellowed at the echoing hall they way he’d once bellowed at the cavalry of\nAngland, working them up to a charge.\n“Citizens! We’ve changed the world! A Great Change!” For the\nmassively worse, in his case. But he heard applause. Or he hoped it was\napplause, and not just the blood rushing in his splitting head. “But there’s\nstill so much to do!”\nSweat tickled his scalp, trickled down his forehead. He paused to catch\nhis breath, to think through the pain. All his life he’d been fixed on what he\nwanted to say. Never given a thought to what they wanted to hear before.\n“Walls… won’t protect us now, only unity!” By the dead, the hall was\nswimming. “Those who’ve enjoyed great privileges must make great\nsacrifices.” They needed some noble gesture. He bared his teeth. “So I give\nup the ‘dan’ in my name! I renounce it! I cut it out! We must all… be\nequal.”\nNo doubt it was clapping now, and lots of it. Folk were standing.\nSomeone was shouting, “The Young Lion!” over and over. It took Leo an\nage to turn around, good leg quivering, aching hand sticky with sweat on\nhis crutch. Isher, Heugen and the rest of the lords looked more than a bit\nqueasy.\n“I’m sure my comrades… who once sat on the Open Council… will all\nhappily do the same. I for one…” He gathered himself for a final effort,\nroared it at the dome in a broken voice. “Cannot think of a title that makes\nme prouder than Citizen!”"

He could hardly make out Risinau’s words.\n“The Assembly no doubt wishes to thank the Young Lion for his\nsacrifices on behalf of the Great Change! It is an inspiration to us all, that he\nhas so soon overcome his wounds and returned to the service of the nation!\nLet the walls of the Agriont be demolished! There is no need for we in\npower to separate ourselves from the people.” Risinau thumped the table\nwith his chubby fist. “We are the people!”\nMore cheering. One more hopping, lurching step and Leo collapsed onto\nthe front bench. Isher caught him under the arm, clapped him on the back,\nwaving to the public gallery.\nThrough his fixed smile he hissed furiously, “We did not agree to this!”\n“You will.” Leo didn’t care a shit about that coward’s discomfort. He’d\ntoo much of his own to deal with. “When you’ve lost an arm and a leg,” he\nsnarled, gripping at his throbbing stump, “a piece of your name doesn’t\nseem such a sacrifice.”\nBroad stood there, where he swore he’d never be again—in uniform.\nThey called him Captain Broad now, if you could bloody believe it. He\nwondered what Liddy would’ve made of that. Asked him what the hell he\nthought he was doing, most likely. He wished he’d got an answer. He hadn’t\nasked for it. Hadn’t even agreed to it. But he hadn’t stopped it, either.\n“Symbols have power!” It was that bloody writer, Sworbreck, near\nfoaming at the mouth with passion. “And the statues on the Kingsway are\nthe most powerful symbols of all! Must the Representatives of the people\npass every day below the very feet of such oppressors as Harod the Great or\nthe Magus Bayaz? Why, I would sooner lay down my life! Lay it down on\nthe gallows where so many martyrs were slain by the Inquisition, than see it\ncontinue for another day!”\n“Citizen Sworbreck wants to set the people free,” murmured Brint, who\nby some magic had gone, within weeks, from lord marshal in the old\nregime, to imprisoned traitor, to general in the People’s Army. Those kinds\nof wild falls and rises were everywhere in Adua these days.\nBroad thought of Valbeck. The streets strewn with rubbish. The mobs\nand the fires. Wallpaper being boiled for soup. “Folk want bread,” he said.\n“Then safety. Then shelter. Freedom’s far down the list, and principles far\nbehind that.”\n“Perhaps you should be a Representative.”\nBroad raised his brows at the benches. There were some good folk on\nthem. Honest folk with good ideas and good intentions. Shame they could\nhardly get a word in. The first day the Assembly sat there’d been this\nmoment, when they all swore an oath to serve the people, then applauded"

The first day the Assembly sat there’d been this\nmoment, when they all swore an oath to serve the people, then applauded\nloud enough to shake the dome and threw their hats in the air. Some\nbastard’s cap was still snagged on a bit of carving, just below the gallery.\nBroad had been sure then that things would get better. Better for everyone.\nBut before the end of the session things were turning sour. Even when they\ncould agree on what the people wanted, they couldn’t agree on how to get\nthere. Ever since, they’d been mired like a wagon with a horse at each\ncorner.\nBroad folded his arms over the breastplate they’d given him. “I’ve a\nshitty enough job as it is, General, thanks all the same.”\n“Good men must stick together,” said Brint. “Try to contain this\nmadness.”\nIf that was the aim, it looked to Broad like they’d already failed. “Can’t\nmake you any promises.”\n“Best you don’t. No one’s keeping the damn things anyway.”\n“We should dismantle the House of the Maker!” a man with a huge\nbeard was squawking out, shaking a great sheaf of papers. His plans for the\nfuture, maybe. There was no shortage of those. “It’s a regressive symbol!”\n“The House o’ the Maker ain’t our problem,” roared a great big fellow\nwith an anchor tattooed on his cheek, “or the statues, or the bloody walls.”\nHe took a great breath, nostrils flaring. “It’s the fucking foreigners!”\nBroad winced. Everyone was furious all the time. Everyone looking for\nsomeone to blame. Everything teetering on the brink of violence. He felt\nlike he had in Styria, in the war. A clenched fist, itching to strike. And the\nworst thing about it—he wasn’t sure he didn’t like the feeling.\n“Citizens, please, we must stand together!” A bony fellow with a shock\nof wild white hair had jumped up, something desperate in his voice that\nmade everyone fall silent. “I have been administering charity in the Three\nFarms for these past twelve years, and I swear to you things have never\nbeen worse. Never.”\nSome nods from the more ragged members of the commons. Some\nrolled eyes among the noblemen.\n“We have wrested the reins of power from the Closed Council. I applaud\nit! They dragged our nation towards the abyss. But the granaries are emptier\nthan they have ever been. Coal is in scarce supply. The injustices that led to\nthis upheaval—the want, the scarcity, the degradation, the disease—they\nwill not simply vanish because we remodel some statues. All the signs point\nto a harsh winter on the way. We must prepare, Citizens, we must be ready!”\nBroad found he was nodding along, but the noise in the hall was\nmounting again. Jeers and cheers together. The old man’s voice was failing,\nand Sworbreck sprang up to thunder over him.\n“Prepare, of course, but we must not indulge in defeatism. We must not\nencourage a dangerous nostalgia for happier times that never were! I would\nrather lay down my life than see this proud assembly cavil, nag and nay-say.\nWe must not talk the nation down!”"

I would\nrather lay down my life than see this proud assembly cavil, nag and nay-say.\nWe must not talk the nation down!”\n“Before we can feed the people’s bellies,” agreed Risinau, “we must\nfeed the people’s minds. Only with a government founded on sound\nprinciples of fairness and justice can they prosper!”\nAs the old man dropped spent into his seat, the rest of the\nRepresentatives were rising to applaud their Chairman. They did that a lot.\nBroad clenched his fists tighter and glanced towards Judge, flopped loose in\nher chair with her head resting on the back, scratching gently at her\nstretched-out throat. With something stuck between horror and excitement,\nhe realised she was looking right back at him.\nHe remembered being chained to a chair with her in his lap, crotch\ngrinding against his, and he felt that guilty tickle, deep inside. He\nremembered her grinning face spotted with blood when he split that\nbanker’s skull, and he felt that tickle even worse. Even better.\nA little smile quivered at the corner of her mouth. As if she guessed\neverything he was thinking. Some men can’t help ’emselves…\n“I have a point to raise!” As the Representatives sat back down, one man\nwas left standing in the aisle. Ordinary-looking, in travel-stained clothes, a\nwalking staff in one hand.\nRisinau peered up at him. “I do not recognise you, Citizen. What district\ndo you represent?”\n“Oh, this is Master Sulfur!” The king tried to swig from his goblet,\nfrowned, upended it and shook a couple of drips into his lap. Then he turned\nhis lazy eyes towards the benches. “He represents the First of the Magi.”\nThat got a murmur from the Assembly, and from the gallery, too. Broad\nraised a brow at Brint. The general could only shrug. Not much would’ve\nsurprised any of them now. If a dragon had risen from the benches, it would\nlikely have been calmly dismissed on a point of order.\n“My master, Bayaz, is gravely concerned by recent events!” called\nSulfur. “In the Union he founded. In the city he built.” He gestured towards\nOrso, who was sitting back and holding out his goblet for a refill. “To the\nking he crowned.”\n“Do thank your master for his concern,” replied Risinau, “but tell him he\nshould keep it for himself!” Laughter at that, and an approving banging of\nfists on benches. “The free people of the Union have no further need of his\nmeddling!”\nSulfur’s eyes narrowed. “How soon you all forget. It was within your\nlifetimes that he saved Adua from the terrors of the Eaters!”\n“By destroying half the city and causing the deaths of thousands!” called\nRisinau. “Bayaz saved us from the Eaters, perhaps, but one wonders…\nwho will save us from Bayaz?” More laughter, and more anger, and\nRisinau flashed that prim little smile. “General Brint, could you see our\nvisitor out? The age of wizards is over, Master Sulfur. An age of reason has\ndawned!”"

I would like to propose Colloquium—”\nA chorus of groans. “Again?”\nMiracles\nS\navine’s throat was raw from screaming.\nDark outside. No chink of light between the shutters. It had been hours,\nthen. It felt like for ever. That same question chased itself around and\naround her mind.\nHow many women had she known who died giving birth?\n“My lady—” began the surgeon.\n“Don’t fucking… call me that,” she snarled over her shoulder between\nwhooping breaths, nearly swallowing her own tongue with fury. “No one…\ncalls anyone that… any more.”\n“Of course not, I apologise. The times take some adjusting to.” He spoke\nin the blandest of drones. As if they were discussing the weather and he by\nno means had his fingers in her quim. “You can push if you feel the need—”\n“Oh, fucking can I?” she screamed at him. The idea that she might be\nable to stop herself was absurd. The one thing she wanted in the world was\nto push.\nThe ridiculous shift they’d given her was tangled around her neck,\nchoking her, and she dragged it up, got it stuck, tore at it, spitting, stitches\npopping, finally ripped it off and it dropped on the bed around her wrists. It\nwas spotted red. Zuri’s hand slipped in and whisked it away, folding it so\nthe blood did not show.\nHow many women had she known who died giving birth?\nShe grunted, and the pain tightened in her belly, and the grunt became a\ngroan, and the groan a moan, and the moan a wail, and the wail a howl, and\nthe howl a grinding scream. She clutched up fistfuls of the sheets, tried to\nclimb the headboard, but that was worse, and she flopped back, and that\nwas worse, and she twisted desperately this way and that on her hands and\nknees, but it was all worse.\n“Fuck,” she gasped. “Shit. Cunt.” She wished she knew worse words.\nWished Zuri had taught her Kantic. They had some savage-sounding curses\nin the South. The room was so bloody hot. Sweat tickled her scalp. But her\narms were so locked and trembling she couldn’t lift a hand to scratch.\nPeople came and went. Barged in with water, with cloths, with muttered\nmessages. Naked on her hands and knees with her arse in the air, honking\nlike a sow, she barely even cared. If anything she was grateful for the waft\nof breeze when the door opened.\n“I do apologise,” murmured the surgeon, “for all the coming and going.”"

Savine’s mother had held the pain of childbirth over her like\na debt that could never possibly be paid, but then Savine’s mother was one\nof the most overdramatic people in the world. Now it seemed she had been\nunderstating the case all along. By the Fates, Savine wished her mother was\nthere. No doubt she would have been at least half-drunk, but she always\nkept her head in a crisis.\nSavine felt Zuri’s hand firm on her shoulder, rubbing at her aching back,\nand was pathetically grateful for it. She wanted to cry, but she was crying\nalready.\n“It might be easier if you were to lie on your back—” murmured the\nsurgeon.\n“Easier for fucking who?”\n“That’s the spirit.”\nShe gave another ripping growl, panted and shuddered and twisted\ndesperately but there was no wriggling free of it. She had wanted so many\nthings. Beating everyone, and winning everything, and having it all, and\nbeing seen to have it all. Now all she cared about was getting this over.\nHow many women had she known who died giving birth?\nShe wondered if dying might be preferable to much more of this.\n“One more push should do the trick—”\n“Fuck yourself!”\n“Good, good.”\nShe screamed again. She screamed her face off. She screamed her guts\nout. She screamed as if she was being murdered. She felt as if she was\nbeing murdered. A stinging, burning, ripping to add to all the rest and she\nran out of breath, her scream dying off into a wheezing groan as she felt\nsomething slither out.\nZuri cradled her head. “Done,” she whispered. “Done.”\nThe best words Savine ever heard. She slumped onto her face, breath\ncoming in shivering gasps.\nSomeone helped her to roll. Someone was wiping her thighs. Someone\npulled a sheet over her. Cool linen, up to her chin.\nThe bed was wet. Wet and sticky and she didn’t care. She lay, eyes\nclosed, breathing. The agony had faded. Just a dull after-ache in her back.\nShe was floating. Drifting on a cloud. Someone was dabbing her face\nwith a flannel. She doubted it would help much but if it made them happy\nshe let them get on with it.\nShe could hear singing in the distance.

Food and fuel might be in short supply, but of opinion there was a\nglut.\nShe could hear crying. High and wild and desperate. Like a wounded\ncat. Very loud. Was it in the room? Was it her? There were a lot of people\ncrying lately. Making an exhibition of your emotions was in fashion.\nRanting them at a crowd, even more so. But she supposed people had a lot\nto cry over. Some more than others.\nThere was the odd absence, of course, among her circle. Those with\nparticularly bad relations with their workers, or those with particularly bad\nluck. She heard the most appalling stories. Such-and-such was found\ndrowned in the canal, by the way. And what’s-his-face knifed and stripped\nin a sewer, did you hear? She pretended they were nothing more than\nstories. She pretended she could not recall the faces of those people,\nlaughing at some function before the Great Change.\nThere was chaos, of course, in the Agriont. The Closed Council\nsuddenly snuffed out, the bureaucracy wobbling on like a chicken with its\nhead cut off. The Breakers had ripped out most of the machinery of\ngovernment; now Risinau and his stooges waggled the levers around,\napparently never realising they were no longer connected to anything. She\nasked Leo how things were in the Assembly of Representatives. He said he\nhad lost battles and never seen a mess like that.\nBut, at the same time, things carried on. Over in the Arches and across\nthe Three Farms, the furnaces still burned. Most of them. The wheels still\nturned. Most of them. Goods were still made and prices still paid and\nbusiness still done. In hushed tones, perhaps, with heads shaken over the\nstate of things. Actors still strutted on the stages of Adua, though they had\nrushed out new pieces in praise of the common man, and asked for applause\nfor Chairman Risinau when the curtain went up, rather than for His\nMajesty.\nSo Savine heard. She had not been out of doors recently herself. She was\nnot sure how she would be received. With boos and jeers, like the villain in\na street play? With the cheers her husband always enjoyed, for doing\nnothing more than whatever he pleased? Or with fists and sticks and nooses\nfrom a warehouse jib, like some of her more unpopular business partners\nduring those bloody first days?\nShe had spent her life making an exhibition of herself. But there are\ntimes when it is only good sense to take a tasteful absence from the public\nstage.\n“It is a boy,” said Zuri.\nSavine had been drifting on the edge of sleep. Lamplight sparkled in her\nwet eyes as she opened them. Zuri stood over her, offering something out. A\nclean white bundle, carefully wrapped, like a present. A white bundle with a\ntiny, squashed-in face.\nSavine gave a kind of sob, right from her guts.\nShe reached for it. She hardly had the strength to lift her arms, but she\nwanted to hold it so badly. She hardly even knew why. She was blubbing,"

She was blubbing,\nsnot clicking in her nose and her sore mouth hopelessly twisted. She\npressed the little bundle to her chest and made noises at it.\n“I’m a mother,” she muttered.\nZuri raised her black brows. “I can see no other conclusion.”\nShe heard the sound of trickling water. The surgeon, washing his bloody\nhands in a basin.\n“Well done,” he said, a neat smile on his face. “Very well done. Tell\nLord Brock he might meet his son.”\nSavine was vaguely tempted to swear at the surgeon again, but it would\nprobably have been in bad taste now. And she was too busy staring at her\nbaby’s face and smiling. Smiling in a weepy, trembly, utterly unguarded\nway that was quite unlike her.\nA person. A tiny, helpless person, that had emerged from her body.\nSavine had always scorned babies even more than pets. When other\nwomen cooed over them she used to smile indulgently, and say the things\nshe was meant to say, and think to herself what ugly, wrinkly, pointless\nthings these little shrieking people were, that needed help for everything\nand shat themselves once an hour.\nThey all say, Yours will seem beautiful, of course. In a smugly knowing\nway, as if shitting out a child comes with secret knowledge, like joining the\nOrder of Magi. They all say it, but you tell yourself the poor things are just\ntrying to wring some shred of advantage from the curse of parenthood and\nlet them have their self-delusion.\nNow it appeared they had been understating the case all along. Her own\nbaby was astonishingly, breathtakingly beautiful, its every twitch a miracle.\nWhat a cliché.\n“A boy,” whispered Savine. She vaguely remembered preferring a\ndaughter. But now somehow a son was exactly the thing she had always\nwanted.\nShe could hear talking near the door. Men’s voices. Warm words.\nCongratulations. As though they had done any of the work. She heard the\nuneven thumping of crutch on boards. She looked up through her\nswimming eyes to see Leo standing over the bed. He had this odd slant to\nhis shoulders, these days. One dropped, where his useless arm was tucked\ninto his jacket, one high, with the effort of leaning on his crutch.\n“There’s a lot of blood,” he croaked, eyes wide.\n“Entirely normal,” said the surgeon. “No need to worry.”\n“It’s a boy,” said Savine, smiling and crying at once.\nHis brow furrowed as he stared down at the baby’s tiny features. As\nthough the whole business was coming as a total shock to him. “I have a\nson.”\n“We have a son— Ah!” She gritted her teeth at a sudden, stabbing pain\nthrough her stomach, down into her legs. “Ah!” And another, even worse,\nthat made her jerk up.\n“What is it?”\n“Take him,” she grunted, offering the baby out with trembling arms.\nLeo tried to rest his crutch against the side of the bed, got his wrist\ntangled with it, was nearly knocked over as Zuri slipped around him.\n“Damn it!”"

Another spasm of pain, much\nlonger, much stronger, and she had to twist onto her side, kicking,\nwhimpering, wriggling in her bloody sheets back onto her hands and knees,\ngroaning for breath, shaking with weariness, trembling with fear.\nHow many women had she known who died giving birth?\n“What’s wrong?” stammered Leo, leaning against the wall beside the\nbed.\nThe surgeon was behind her now, frowning, his cold hand pressing at\nher belly. “Lord— I mean Citizen Brock, you might be happier waiting\noutside—”\n“Who cares a shit whether he’s happy!” hissed Savine through her\ngritted teeth. “What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing.” The surgeon looked up at her over his glinting lenses. “But I\nfear you still have some work to do.”\nShe felt a kind of cold horror, then, along with the pain. “What is it?”\nZuri had the baby in the crook of one arm, but she slid her free hand\nunder one of Savine’s and squeezed it. “Twins.”\nA Little Public Hanging\nA\ns a child, Orso had delighted in the sound of distant crowds. Crowds\nmeant spectacles, festivals, excitement: the thrill of the Summer Contest,\nthe pomp of a parade. As a young man, he had begun to find that noise\ntiresome. Crowds meant functions, rituals, responsibilities: the\ndisappointment of grand banquets, the tedium of state visits. Now the sound\nof a crowd filled him with horror. In the new Union, crowds meant riots,\nterror, random violence. The baying of the mob.\nLost in the anonymity of a crowd, people would commit horrors that\nwould have sickened them alone. That no doubt sickened them afterwards.\nBut their regret was scant consolation for the victims.\n“What’s going on, Hildi?” he murmured.\n“Don’t know.” And Hildi bit her lip, as if steeling herself for bad news.\nShe always looked that way, these days.\nAs soon as they stepped out into the Square of Marshals the nature of\nthe occasion became clear.\n“Oh, damn,” said Orso, his shoulders slumping. “I bloody hate\nhangings.”\nIt was a new kind of gallows. Progress, he supposed. Instead of a cross-\nbeam with ropes, five tall spars stuck up at an angle behind the platform,\nlike the fingers of a clawing hand. There were pulleys at the tips, a\ncounterweight of iron plates behind each one. Instead of rope, steel cables\nhad been looped into five nooses. Orso noticed, as he was herded by his\nguards towards an enclosure where, as usual, he could be made an exhibit\nfor the curious, that there was a life-sized dummy hanging from one of\nthem.\nChairman Risinau sat at the very front of the crowd, Judge on one side\nand Pike on the other. The leaders of the Great Change. That bloody writer,\nSworbreck, was leaning towards them, waving up at the towering gallows."

Justice was done, but justice was not seen to be done. Now, with a\ncounterweight released…” He gave a showman’s flourish. Nothing\nhappened. “Go on, then!”\nThere was a clatter of machinery, weights dropped, cable whizzed and\nthe dummy was jerked up by the neck to flop about in the wind some five\nstrides above the platform. The crowd gasped, then began to applaud, to\ncheer, to hurl good-natured abuse. A carnival atmosphere. Orso winced and\ntried to loosen his collar with a finger.\n“Ingenious.” Risinau nodded sagely, as though at a demonstration of a\nmachine to peel fruit. He might not have been much of an administrator, but\nhe knew the power of a good show. “You should be immensely proud.”\n“A happy combination of my flare for theatre and Citizen Curnsbick’s\ntechnical know-how.” And Sworbreck put an arm around the Great\nMachinist and gave him a friendly squeeze. Curnsbick, who had abandoned\nhis spectacular waistcoats and was now modelling the inconspicuous tones\nof mud, looked more than a little nauseous.\n“Ain’t it a bit bloodless?” said Judge, with her usual deadly sneer.\nRisinau rolled his eyes. “I do declare, Citizeness Judge, you would see\nthe condemned torn apart by wild dogs if you thought it could be\nmanaged.”\nShe sat back, rubbing thoughtfully at her rashy throat, as if weighing up\nthe benefits of public execution by canines. “Let’s see how this works first.\nBring out the prisoners!”\n“Oh no,” muttered Orso.\nLord Chamberlain Hoff came first. Orso remembered him ushering\nportraits of potential brides into his mother’s salon in tedious procession.\nWhat happy times those seemed, now. Lord Chancellor Gorodets was next.\nThen High Consul Matstringer. Then the surveyor general—by the Fates,\nhe’d been kept away from the Closed Council by his bladder so often that\nOrso couldn’t remember the man’s name.

Chains clanked as they were led up onto the\nplatform, into the shadows of those five tall beams. The great lords of the\nClosed Council. The men who had ruled the Union in Orso’s name. They\nmade a sorry sight now, in sackcloth rather than fur and braid, in fetters\nrather than chains of office, their grey hair and beards in greasy tangles.\n“Fellow Citizens!” Risinau never missed a chance to address a crowd.\n“We are gathered to see five enemies of the people receive their just deserts.\nTo see righteous retribution on behalf of the Union’s oppressed. To wave\nfarewell to the age of tyranny.” He spread his arms wide. “And to welcome\nthe age of equality with open arms!”\nCheers. Boos. Laughter.

        "text": "the age of equality with open arms!”\nCheers. Boos. Laughter. A few bits of rubbish flung at the scaffold as\nnooses were tightened around necks. The Great Change had made little\ndifference to the behaviour of the mob at an execution. A rotten orange\nspattered against the side of Gorodets’ head.\n“We’ve danced for their benefit the last few centuries!” screeched Judge,\ntwisting to face the crowd. “Now they can dance for ours!”\nOrso had never harboured much affection for his Closed Council. He\nhad thought of its members as a man thinks of his creditors, his landlords,\nhis jailers. But seeing them like this, he had to hold back tears.\nHoff shuffled forwards as far as the cable would allow, which was not\nfar. “Your Majesty!” he cried over the noise. “I’m sorry!”\n“It’s me who should be sorry!” Orso rounded on Judge, Risinau and\nPike. “Please! What crime are they accused of?”\n“Corruption, profiteering and exploitation,” said Risinau.\n“Treason against the People of the Union!” hissed Judge.\n“Is there evidence?” asked Orso.\nJudge glared back at him. “They sat on the Closed Council. What more\nevidence do you need?”\n“Were they allowed a defence?”\n“They sat on the Closed Council. What defence could there be?”\n“We sat there, too, Your Majesty,” said Pike softly. “You know each man\nof them was a willing cog in the monstrous machine, a callous accomplice\nin the purges and injustice. Can you truly pretend that these are better men\nthan the ones they ordered hanged outside Valbeck?”\nOrso swallowed. “The ones you ordered hanged.”\n“A better world comes with a bill to pay. We all must make sacrifices.\nAnd look around you.” Pike calmly scanned the baying crowd. “The people\nhave given their verdict.”\n“Get on and hang the bastards!” someone roared, and other voices\njoined him. Plainly, there was no appetite for clemency. When was there\never?\n“Whatever they did, they did in my name,” said Orso, his voice\ncracking. “At least put me up there with them.”\n“All in good time, Your Majesty,” he heard Judge murmur.\nRisinau held up a hand to quiet her, his hard little eyes fixed on Orso. “If\nthe king cannot remain silent while the People’s Justice is administered, he\nwill have to be restrained. Captain Broad?”\nA monster of a man stepped up to the royal enclosure. The royal pigpen.\nA neckless bull made to look even more savage by a pair of wire-framed\neye-lenses perched on the flat bridge of his nose. He planted one great hand\non the rail before Orso, a tattoo on the back. An axe and a bolt of lighting,\nwith stars on the scarred knuckles. Hildi took a step towards him, bunching\nher fists, like a kitten raising its hackles at a bear. The big man just gave her\na sad smile and took off those little lenses to show tired, weak eyes.\n“It’s a brave show, Your Majesty.” No threat in his soft voice, just a\nweary pragmatism, and he breathed ever so gently on his lenses and gave"

You don’t want to get hurt,\nand I damn sure don’t want to hurt you.” He perched them back in their\nplace and raised his brows at Orso. “Things are bad enough. Why make ’em\nworse?”\nHe was right. Thousands of people had crammed into the Square of\nMarshals to see these men hang. Orso was powerless. More so than ever.\nHe let Hildi drag him back into his chair and sat mute, hands limp in his\nlap.\nLord Hoff noisily cleared his throat. “If I might say… a few words\nbefore—”\n“No.” And Judge snapped her fingers.\nA clank from beneath the platform. With a whirring of gears, the\ncounterweight dropped and Hoff was snatched up, just like the dummy. He\nbounced wildly at the top, his head caught the beam and he flopped,\nswinging, blood bubbling down his face, his neck grotesquely stretched.\nOrso clung to the rail of his enclosure, his white hands either side of\nBroad’s.\nJudge snapped her fingers again. Gorodets gave a whoop as he was\nwhisked into the air. Pike watched his one-time colleagues dangle,\nemotionless, eyes glittering.\n“Wait!” Matstringer left one shoe behind as he was plucked from the\nplatform by the throat. The surveyor general squeezed his eyes shut, then\nhis counterweight dropped and he was flung up, too.\nHoff swung, his distended neck turning black. The surveyor general did\nnot appear to have been killed instantly. He was still kicking. Perhaps just\nsome nervous impulse. Orso hoped so. Something ran from the leg of his\nsackcloth trousers and spattered to the platform below.\nCurnsbick put his head in his hands.\nRucksted bared his teeth. “Fuck the lot of you.”\nSnap. The last counterweight dropped. Rucksted flew up, but something\nmust have gone wrong with the mechanism. Instead of being left hanging\nhigh, the noose was jerked all the way into the pulley. His head flew off one\nway. His body dropped the other, crashing onto the platform, showering\nblood.\n“Ha!” screeched Judge, leaping to her feet in delight.\nThe crowd gave an almighty roar of approval. A woman danced, pulling\noff her apron to wave it over her head like a flag.\n“Oh,” said Hildi, in a high little voice. Because she was so clever and so\ntough, Orso forgot, sometimes, how young she was. He wanted to put his\nhand over her eyes. He wanted to put his hand over his own. But it was far\ntoo late.\nHe had sat horrified through those meetings in the White Chamber\nwhere, beneath the blandly monstrous oversight of the First of the Magi,\nprinciples were squashed beneath profits, corruption was raised to an art\nform and justice was reduced to a jelly.

Now he had failed to protect his councillors from his people.\n“I have failed at everything,” he whispered.\nThe four corpses hung limp. Gorodets dangled a little lower than the\nothers, for some reason, twisting slowly one way, then the other. The crowd\nhad turned quiet. Towards the back, people were already drifting away.\nThere was a sense of disappointment. Perhaps they had discovered that\nwhen enemies fall, they leave a hole. No doubt they would find new ones to\nfill it with soon enough.\n“Well.” Risinau stood, hands on his paunch. “I for one am glad to have\nthat behind us. Now we can focus on putting things right.”\n“Behind us?” Judge growled as she glared up at the dangling bodies.\n“We’ve barely begun.”\nOrso closed his eyes. He realised that, somewhere deep inside, he had\nbeen supposing this was all temporary. A passing fad. A nightmare from\nwhich they would all soon wake.\nBut perhaps this was simply how the world was, now.\nPerhaps this was how it had always been.\nNest of Vipers\n“I\ncan feel it in my liver,” whispered Isern, “the little bitch is up to\nsomething.”\nCorleth strode through the crowd ahead, down the rain-slick cobbled\nstreets that led from Skarling’s Hall into the chilly city, a canvas bag over\none shoulder.\n“I see it,” said Isern, “and the moon sees it, and the only one can’t see it\nis you.”\n“Not the only one,” said Rikke. “Aside from the moon and your liver,\neveryone likes her well enough.”\n“So you’re saying there’s a lot of fools about, a thing I well knew\nalready. Did she tell you she was going?”\n“She did not,” said Rikke, “but why should she?”\n“Did she ask leave to go?”\n“She did not, but why should she?”\n“What’s she got in the bag?”\n“Folk sometimes have bags, that’s no proof of anything.”\n“Didn’t I tell you not to get cocky?”\n“Only a thousand times.”\n“If you’d listened to one of ’em I could hold my tongue now.” Isern\nbared her teeth, showing that missing one, eyes still fixed on Corleth. “I’m\ntelling you she smells wrong.”\n“You’re a fine one to complain of odours.”\n“Sneaking out o’ Skarling’s Hall.”\n“You’d no objection to us sneaking into it.”\n“When we were sneaking around our enemies.”\n“We did somewhat leave the Brocks with their arses in the breeze, and\nwe’d been welcoming them with a smile not long before.”\n“You had, but you smile far too easily.” Isern slipped around a corner,\npulling Rikke through a knot of people and behind a cart where they could\nwatch Corleth walk on. “Bloody Brocks. They’d have stabbed you in the\nback if you hadn’t stabbed ’em first.

They\nweren’t tight. They weren’t heavy. But they seemed to chafe at her these\ndays, since she started sitting in Skarling’s Chair. “Guess we’ll never know\nfor sure now, will we…”\nIsern shook her shaggy head in disgust. “We’re not here to prod at the\nsoft underbelly o’ your guilt, which is a thing a leader needs to toss into the\nshit-pit along with her mercy, but to find out what your friend Corleth is\ndoing creeping through Carleon, all flighty and furtive.”\n“She don’t look all that furtive.” Wasn’t like she was padding on tiptoe,\nor sliding around corners, or checking behind her, the way Rikke would\nsurely have done if she was about some shifty business. “She’s just walking\nthrough town.”\n“Aye, but where’s she walking?” Isern pressed herself to a wall and\npeered around its corner, and Rikke found herself doing the same. Corleth\nwas ahead still, trotting up the steps towards a little house like a hundred\nothers in the city, rain drip-dripping from the eaves of its mossy thatch.\n“She comes to this house every other day, d’you see. Regular as the moon.”\nRikke frowned. That did sound a little troubling. “Maybe she’s found a\nman to keep her warm in the winter.” She blew into her cupped hands,\nthinking of the Nail, and what they’d got up to that morning, and had to\ngrin. “They can be worth the effort.”\n“A lover would be nothing to hide.”\nRikke shrugged. “A really ugly lover?”\n“Shush.” Isern swept Rikke into a doorway with the back of her arm.\nWhat with the clammy cold it reminded her of their times out in the woods,\nhiding from Stour Nightfall’s men, and that brought back a stab of the fear\nshe’d felt then, followed by a warm wash of satisfaction that she currently\nhad the bastard hobbled in a cage.\nThe door opened. Corleth grinned, which seemed strange, as she wasn’t\nmuch of a grinner. She went in and the door shut.\n“Right,” growled Isern, striding towards the house. “Now we’ll plumb\nthe bottom of her schemes.”\n“Who’s cocky now?” hissed Rikke, hurrying after. “What if she is hiding\nsomething?” She pictured a room crammed with Black Calder’s cut-throats,\nall turning as Isern kicked the door open. “We should get Shivers and a few\nof his lads…”\nBut Isern was already thumping at the rickety door hard enough to rattle\nit in the frame. It whipped open and Corleth frowned out, somewhat\nsuspicious to see the two of them crowded onto the doorstep. “What are you\ntwo doing here?”\n“What’re you doing here?” roared Isern, triumphant, and she caught\nCorleth around the neck and shoved her into the house, pulling a dagger\nwith the other hand."

One room lit by one little window, a fine cook-smell\nwafting from a pot on the fire. The canvas sack lay open beside it, but\ninstead of secrets it held carrots and a couple of bones. There was no gang\nof cut-throats. Just a bent old woman with weak eyes and a generous wart\non her cheek, highly surprised by the blade-wielding hillwoman just burst\ninto her house.\n“What the fuck?” croaked Corleth, flattened against the wall with Isern’s\nhand clamping off her windpipe.\nThe old woman snatched up a broom. “Let go o’ my granddaughter!”\nRikke sighed, feeling more’n a little guilty over her part in this farce.\n“Reckon you can stow the dagger, Isern. Less you plan to chop carrots with\nit.”\n“My grandma lives here,” muttered Corleth, rubbing at her pink neck as\nIsern let her go. “I come see her when I can. Make sure she’s got wood for\nher fire. Bring her scraps for soup.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me?” asked Rikke.\n“Got enough weighing on your shoulders.” By the dead, Rikke felt\nworse’n ever. “D’you think you could put the blade up now?”\nWith a level of sourness few indeed could match, Isern secreted the\nknife in the ragged depths of her clothing.\n“You understand we’ve got to be watchful,” said Rikke. “Black Calder’s\na crafty one. Could have spies anywhere.”\n“You thought my Corleth was spying?” The old woman lowered her\nbroom, lip all a-wobble, poor thing. “All she talks about is how clever you\nare. How proud she is to be serving you. How you’ll change the North. Folk\ncome to me for advice and I’m always telling ’em what a good thing—”\n“All right, Granny,” said Corleth, waving her down. “We have to be\nwatchful, it’s true. Just a misunderstanding, is all.”\n“Aye,” said Rikke, giving Isern a hard side-eye. “It’s easy to stuff the\nblame in the wrong places.”\n“And it’s true Black Calder’s crafty.” The old woman took a step\ntowards Rikke, lowering her voice. “Between you and me, there’s this old\nbitch lives two doors down I’ve never trusted. You should keep an eye on\nher.”\n“Might be we’ll do that.”\n“Now.” Corleth’s granny stared sternly around. “Who’s for soup?”\nThe cold rain was flitting down harder when they made it back into the\nstreet, and Rikke pulled her hood up again and twitched it tight against the\ncold. “Thank the dead we smoked out that nest o’ vipers,” she said.\nIsern was not amused. “You can’t let your guard down.

Clover counted ten, but he kept sitting\non his stump all the while so he wouldn’t spook ’em, only moving to give\nthe carcass over the fire a prod, and that very slowly. The sun was getting\nlow beyond the hills and the valley full of shadows, so he couldn’t really\ntell the faces, but there was one old-timer with a grey beard, one with a\nleather hood, one who wore a dented helmet, one young lad. Friends,\nenemies, the longer Clover lasted, the more they all looked the same. The\nmore they bloody were the same.\nFinally, one strolled up to the fire and held his palms out to it. Clover\nknew his face as it came into the light. Trapper. One of Black Calder’s boys.\n“Hey, Trapper,” he said, friendly as he could. Always keep it friendly, if\nyou can.\n“Clover? That you?”\n“I believe it is, though these days I’m sure o’ nothing.”\n“Where the bloody hell have you been?”\n“That there is quite a story.” Trapper’s men were poking around, but not\ntoo carefully. It was chilly, and they were drifting over to the warmth, and\nthat homely smell of cooking meat. “Sailed to Midderland with the Great\nWolf and the Young Lion, felt seasick on the way over, got caught in a\nstorm, fought a battle, lost, felt seasick on the way back.” They’d gathered\nabout the other side of the fire, now, off guard. “Then Tricky Rikke sent me\ndown here to have a word with you lot. Some doubts over where the\nborder’s at, apparently.”\nTook ’em a moment to catch up.

Unless you want to come back later?”\nTrapper shifted one hand to sit on the pommel of his sword and slowly\nshook his head. “Don’t think we can.”\n“Then I guess we’ll have to do this hungry.” Clover gave a sharp whistle\nand an arrow flitted from nowhere and stuck quivering into the carcass.\nHis hope had been they’d stay calm, realise they were surrounded, do\nthe sensible thing. But thinking about it now, the sensible thing’s a lot to ask\nonce arrows start flying, even into things that are already dead.\n“Fuck!” someone shouted. The old boy with the grey beard whirled\nabout, axe all over the place. One of the others had to dodge it, nearly fell,\nstumbled back and kicked a shower of sparks from the fire.

He twisted around,\nreaching over his shoulder, then under, trying to get to the arrow, but his\nfingertips couldn’t quite touch it.\n“I’m shot!” he hissed between his gritted teeth. “They fucking shot me!”\n“We see,” said Clover, pointing around the farm. “I’ve got men in the\nbarn there, and over there. And in those trees, and those. All around you,\nshafts nocked and strings drawn.” There was only Sholla and a few others,\nreally, but Clover had no problem with a lie that saved lives. Or any other\nkind, for that matter. “Unless you all want an arrow you can’t reach, my\nstrongly worded advice would be to stack your weapons neatly over there\nand come join me at the fire, so we can all have a little chat without the\ndistraction of the Great Leveller breathing on our necks.”\n“How do we know you won’t just kill us?” asked a scratty-haired young\nlad beside Trapper. His version of Flick, it appeared, both in age and sense,\nor lack thereof.\n“’Cause if the purpose was to kill you, I’d have ordered ’em to shoot\nwhile you were still blundering up the road. Believe me—and Trapper’ll\nconfirm it—I’m not one for taking unnecessary risks with my person. All I\nwant is a chat. No call for further bloodshed.”\nNow Downside came striding from the trees, dragging the one with the\nlambskin cloak along with one big hand, heavy axe gripped in the other.\n“Chief,” he grunted, and threw the man down next to the one with the\narrow in his shoulder."

With bad grace the others swung bows from backs, pulled out axes\nand knives, set down spears, till there was quite a little armoury heaped up\nin front of the farmhouse.\nClover gave a satisfied nod. “Don’t that feel better?”\n“Not really,” said Trapper, frowning at Downside’s axe.\n“Well, it does for me, I can tell you that.” Clover whistled again, and\nSholla, Flick and a couple of others slipped from the hedgerows, from the\nbarn, from their hiding places and padded over, arrows still nocked to their\nbows, while Trapper and his men dropped in a reluctant half-circle around\nthe far side of the fire, like children about to listen to a story.\n“Now then,” said Clover. “Why don’t we start with what Black Calder’s\nabout? What’s his mood, what’s his strength, what’s his thinking, you know.\nAnd naught but the truth, if you please.”\n“Truth?” said one of Trapper’s men, the one with the big grey beard.\n“Truth is there’ll be a price to pay for this, Jonas Clover.” And he curled his\nlip and spat in the fire, and might have caught the carcass, too, which was\nsomewhat of an annoyance. “Man can’t just flip sides whenever the wind\nchanges.”\nClover rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “There’s always one.”\n“Black Calder’s going to win back the North!” the old man growled.\nQuite the voice he had, rough as a throat full of gravel. “No fucking painted\nwitch and no fucking Long Eye’ll change it.” He glanced up at Downside,\nstanding over him. “When he does, the lot of you will—”\nThere was a sharp crack as Downside buried his axe in the man’s head\nand dragged him over backwards. His leg kicked so hard he kicked his boot\noff and it went flying high in the air, onto the roof of the barn, and that was\nthe last move he made.\nDownside leaned over, working his axe free. “That boy had a big\nmouth,” he grunted, by way of explanation.\n“He did rather,” Clover had to admit. He spread his hands at the men on\nthe other side of the fire, all staring at their dead comrade’s one bare foot.\n“But could we all work at making that the last corpse we leave here?\nReckon we can all agree if there’s one thing we got too much of in the\nNorth, it’s corpses.”\n“You killed my uncle, you bastard!” hissed the scratty lad. “You better\nbe looking over your shoulder, ’cause one o’ these days I’ll—” There was a\ncrack as Downside split his skull and blood spattered right in Clover’s face.\n“Gah!” he squawked, flinching back and nearly falling off his stump,"

A\nred pool quickly spread, hissing faintly as its edge touched the embers of\nthe fire. Downside frowned at his stained axe-blade, started wiping it on the\nboy’s back.\n“Could you bloody not?” Clover shouted at him.\nDownside shrugged. “Sorry, Chief. Had the feel of a feud brewing, and\nit’s always best to settle a feud at the outset, rather’n let it fester.”\nClover took a hard breath, still wiping spots of blood from his face.\n“I can see your point, I suppose.”\n“I’m shot,” whimpered the one with the arrow.\n“We see. Where was I?”\n“Black Calder,” said Flick.\n“Right, yes. Black Calder. How’s his mood?”\nSholla slipped her arm around Trapper’s head and eased the point of her\nknife up his nose. “And like the man said, naught but the truth.”\n“Never seen him this angry,” squeaked Trapper, staring cross-eyed at\nSholla’s knife. “But cold, too. Cold and careful.”\n“I was worried that might be the way of it,” muttered Clover. “How\nmany men does he have?”\nTrapper winced as Sholla’s knife tickled his nostril. “More coming in\nevery day. Fresh men, and strays got back from the Union, and he’s made a\ndeal with this new bastard from beyond the Crinna. What do they call him?”\n“Stand-i’-the-Barrows,” said one of the others. “They say he sleeps in a\nnest of bones.”\n“That don’t sound good,” said Flick.\n“Sounds bloody uncomfortable,” said Sholla.\nSounded bloody uncomfortable for the whole North. When Black Dow\nbrought Stranger-Come-Knocking and his savages over the Crinna to help\nhim fight the Union, the trouble had lasted years. It was plain Calder was\ngoing to make a real fight of it. And that was a fight Clover didn’t want to\nbe on either side of.\nWhen he turned on Stour, he’d had no doubt it was the right choice. For\nhis own sake, for Wonderful’s sake, for everyone’s sake. But he’d been sure\nRikke would kill the bastard. Then she hadn’t, and he started to worry she\nmight be too soft for the job. Siding with the winner is forever sensible, of\ncourse. The trouble starts when you’re not sure who the winner might be.\nQuite the pickle.\n“All right, Trapper, I’m letting you and your lads go.” Clover winced at\nthe dead old man’s bare foot, dirt under the big toenail. “Well, the ones still\ncapable o’ going. Tell Black Calder you ran into us. Tell him I tried to be\nreasonable.”\n“This what you call reasonable?” squealed the one with the arrow in his\nshoulder.\n“Reasonably reasonable, anyway. Tell him I’d like a word, in due\ncourse, explain how things stand. Information to our mutual advantage and\nso on.”\nTrapper slowly nodded. Didn’t say what he thought of the idea. He knew"

He knew\nbetter’n that. “Reckon we’ll head off, then. Can we take our weapons?”\nClover cocked an eyebrow at that heap of ironware. “Can’t say the\nnotion delights me.”\n“Come on, Clover. Don’t make me head back disarmed. It’s fucking\nembarrassing.”\n“Aye, but if you’re anything like me, you’d rather be embarrassed than\ndead. I really don’t want you chasing after us.”\nThe one with the leather hood looked quite put out. “I need my sword,\nthough. Let me get my sword.”\n“I’m saying no,” said Clover, firmly as he could without raising his\nvoice. “It’s not a negotiation. No exceptions. It’s a no.”\nThe one in the hood looked to be getting a bit upset about it.\n“That was my father’s sword, you—”\nThere was a crack and Clover blinked as blood spattered in his face\nagain. Downside had split this bastard’s head, too.\n“What the—”\n“Sounding a bit feudy to me, Chief,” said Downside, wiping his axe.\n“Me and you need to have a talk,” growled Clover at him. “The rest o’\nyou, get moving.” And he waved Trapper and the others off into the night.\nThe one with the lambskin cloak groaned as his friends helped him up, and\nthey hurried off towards the darkening trees, leaving their three dead\nbehind, the one with the arrow-stuck shoulder still whining that he was\nshot.\nClover prodded at the meat. “Well, this is no bloody good now.” Spat on\nby that dead old-timer, bled on by a couple of others and not cooked\nanyway. “Feels like all I’m ever doing is trying to convince new masters I\ncan be trusted.”\n“Maybe if you didn’t betray the old ones…” muttered Sholla, poking\nthrough the weapons.\n“You think we should’ve stuck to Stour?”\n“I do not.” She took a knife she liked from the pile and pushed it\nthrough her belt. “Just saying there are consequences.”\n“Don’t much care for that word.”\n“Which one?” asked Flick.\n“Consequences. Which one do you think? There?” Clover shook his\nhead. “By the dead, boy, you are dense as a stump.”\n“If they’ve crossed the river…” Flick was still catching up with where\nthey’d been when Trapper and the rest arrived. “Weren’t we supposed to kill\n’em?”\n“You may not yet have realised this, but I prefer, in general, to kill as\nfew people as possible.” And Clover gave Downside a significant glance,\nwhich had all the impact of an arrow on a rockface. “If we kill ’em all, they\ncan’t take a message back to Calder, and it seems wise to keep the lines o’\ncommunication open.”\n“Lines o’ what now?”\nClover sighed. “To keep talking. Downside, since you made the corpses,\nreckon it’s only fair you bury ’em, too.”\n“Fuck,” he grunted, sliding his axe away. “Tell you what, it’s thankless\nwork, killing folk.”"

But if I can\nstand on my own two feet in the Assembly, it’ll be worth it.” He frowned in\nthe mirror at the steel rod sticking from his rolled-up trouser leg, the springs\naround the socket that served as an ankle, the curving metal plate that\npassed for a foot. “Stand on my own one foot, anyway.”\n“So… you mean to keep going there?”\n“I won’t just sit crying over lost glories. The future of the Union will be\ndecided in the Assembly.” He looked at Savine in the mirror, propped up on\nthe chaise in a mass of pale skirts with one of the babies to her breast and\nthe other asleep beside her. He still couldn’t tell which of them was which.\n“Are you sure it’s wise…” She had a nervous tone he wasn’t used to\nhearing. “To make an exhibition of yourself?”\n“I never thought I’d live to hear you arguing against making an\nexhibition.”\n“You almost didn’t live to hear it,” she said, softly.\nHe frowned at that. “I don’t need reminding. It was my neck in the\nnoose. But I’ve been given a say, and I mean to use it.” It’d be a different\nkind of fight than he was used to. Words instead of swords, ideas instead of\narmour, speeches instead of charges. He’d be standing alone, with no\nfaithful brothers-in-arms to watch his back. But he was as hungry for\nvictory as ever. More, maybe. Every twinge in his leg, every throb in his\narm, every shocked glance at his stump or his scars was a spur in him.\nPain is the price of doing the right thing, Leo’s father used to say.\nStrange. He felt he hadn’t really understood that till now. Maybe he hadn’t\nreally understood anything till now. He grimaced as he tried out a step and\nhis weight went through his aching stump.\n“Curnsbick said he could make you one that looks more…”\n“Like a leg?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“This is better. I want them to see what I’ve sacrificed. I want to shove it\nin their faces. I suppose I could get a prettier one to wear around the house\n—”\n“Not on my account. I married you, not your leg.”\n“Regretting it?”\n“We made mistakes.” He saw her swallow, and frown down at the floor.\n“We made terrible mistakes. But our marriage makes more sense than ever.”"

        "text": "“Regretting it?”\n“We made mistakes.” He saw her swallow, and frown down at the floor.\n“We made terrible mistakes. But our marriage makes more sense than ever.”\nShe didn’t mention love. Leo wasn’t sure when they’d last used the\nword. Before Stoffenbeck, certainly. He remembered what she told him, the\nday he proposed. Or the day their mothers did. Their marriage was a\nbusiness arrangement. A political alliance. And that was what he needed\nnow—partners and allies. Love was a luxury he couldn’t afford.\nSavine was gazing down at her sleeping baby. Their baby. There was\nlove in her eyes then, he noticed. “Given all that’s happened,” she\nmurmured, “we are lucky to be where we are.”\nCrossing a room was an ordeal, pissing hard labour and dressing himself\nnear impossible, but it was true things could’ve been worse. They’d been\nconfessed traitors, after all, rotting in the cells at King Orso’s pleasure. Now\nOrso was a prisoner in his own palace and they were back in Savine’s\ncavernous house just off the Middleway. Most of it was shut up for lack of\nservants, but even so.\n“We know people living far worse,” he said.\n“We know people not living at all. We have to protect ourselves.” She\ngently stroked the dark fuzz on her baby’s head. Their baby’s head. “Protect\nour family.”\n“The people still admire me. We can use that.” Being bounced on the\nshoulders of that mob outside the House of Questions hadn’t been pleasant.\nBut a lot better than being torn to pieces by them. “That and my place on\nthe Assembly.” Leo tried to force his scarred mouth into the easy-going\nsmile he used to have, the one he’d worn when King Jezal handed him that\nbadly balanced commemorative sword, but that felt like a thousand years\nago. There was still a trace of the Young Lion there, if he tried. “No\nrecklessness this time. No vanity. No sentiment.”\n“No overambition,” said Savine. “No gambles. We have to stay safe.\nTake care who we trust.”\nLeo snorted. “We could hardly have picked worse friends.”\n“Isher, Heugen and Barezin.”\n“Cowards and fools,” grunted Leo. “Though they might still have their\nuses.”\n“That savage Stour Nightfall.”\n“I should’ve kept him on a tighter leash.”\n“That weasel Vick dan Teufel.”\n“Quite the liar.” He’d have been outraged by that once. Now he almost\nadmired it. Things he’d taken for failings looked like strengths these days,\ncrowning virtues like fatal flaws.\n“Your old friend Rikke.”\nLeo frowned. “She was held up by bad weather.”\n“Please.” Savine curled her lip. “She sent a letter to King Orso, months\nin advance, warning him about the whole plan. He knew we were coming.”\nLeo’s nails bit at his palm as he clenched his fist. “That fucking\ntreacherous bitch,” he snarled, dotting the mirror with spit. “I risked my life\nfor her! Why the hell would she—”\n“We cannot waste time on what is done,” said Savine. “We have to learn"

Why the hell would she—”\n“We cannot waste time on what is done,” said Savine. “We have to learn\nthe lessons and find better friends for the future.”\n“You’re right.” Leo took a long breath and pressed the anger down. He\ncouldn’t let himself be swept off by whatever emotion blew his way. “What\nabout your man Broad? He’s close with the Breakers. A captain in the\nPeople’s Army.”\nSavine thoughtfully pursed her lips. “Too close with the Breakers,\nperhaps.”\n“Aren’t his family still in Angland?”\n“You’re suggesting we squeeze them?” She looked surprised. Shocked,\neven. “You’ve changed.”\n“To regret the methods, you have to win.” He couldn’t stay on his feet\nany longer, and he grunted as he took one lurching step and the padded\nsocket squeezed at his stump. “Once you’ve won… who cares about the\nmethods?”\n“Have you been taking lessons from my father?”\nNot long ago he would’ve thought of Sand dan Glokta as his utter\nopposite. Now he hissed with pain as he dropped down on a chair facing\nher. “The man ruled the Union for thirty years. He’s the aspiring cripple’s\nhero. He must still know useful people. Useful things. Where is he?”\n“Out of sight and staying there, would be my guess. As for Master\nBroad, I owe him and his family. They saved my life in Valbeck.”\n“Now who’s changed?” He worked himself forwards to fumble with the\nbuckles that held the iron leg on. “I thought you had no use for sentiment.”\n“I’ve always paid my debts. That’s just good business.” She frowned at\nhim, the scar on her forehead puckering, and held her baby tight. Their\nbaby. Whichever one it was. “Since we are being unsentimental, the Broads\nare not the only useful people left in Angland. What about your old friends\nGlaward and Jurand?”\nLeo froze. That image of the two of them kneeling on a Sipanese carpet\nthrust itself into his mind, and not for the first time. Glaward gripping two\nfistfuls of the covers, eyes squeezed shut. Jurand pressed against his back,\nfingers tangled in his hair, biting at his ear. The blissful look on their faces\n—\n“Think I need a nursemaid?” he snapped, forcing the thought away.\n“Someone to keep me out of trouble?”\n“I think we need people around us we can trust,” said Savine. “You\nnever told me what happened between the three of you.”\nLeo curled his lip and carried on undoing the buckles. He pretended to\nbe disgusted. He was disgusted. Of course he was.\n“I caught them fucking,” he said, trying to sound like he hardly cared,\neven if his heart was pounding. “In Sipani.”\n“Isn’t that what one does in Sipani? Fucking who?”\nHe cleared his throat. “Each other.”\n“Ahhh.” She closed her eyes for a moment then gave the slightest nod,\nas if at a puzzle she had just realised the obvious solution to. “That explains\na great deal.”\nHe frowned.

Explained their falling out, or explained something…\nmore? “You’re not surprised?”\n“In business one encounters every kind of person.” She was busy trying\nto work her nipple back into the baby’s mouth. “You have to separate their\npreferences from their value. Imagine how much poorer I’d be had I never\ngone into partnership with Curnsbick.”\nLeo looked up from the buckles. “The Great Machinist? The father of\nthe new age? He…” Fucks men? The words lurked in Leo’s dry mouth, but\nhe couldn’t quite seem to force them out.\nSavine raised her brows. “Have you not seen those waistcoats of his?”\n“I thought he was married.”\n“So was Queen Terez, and by all accounts she’s been through more\nquims than her son. Jurand is clever. A great organiser. And Glaward is\nfaithful and diligent. If they had been with us at Stoffenbeck—”\n“We might have won?” snapped Leo.\nShe shrugged it off. “They have the kind of loyalty one cannot buy.”\n“I thought you could buy anything.”\n“I thought so, too, once.” She frowned towards the floor again. “It turns\nout I was wrong.”\n“I never thought I’d live to hear you admit that. You have changed.”\n“I’ve had to.” He caught a glimpse of the old iron as her eyes flicked up\nto his in the mirror. “Can you get past it?”\nThat memory bubbled to the surface again, but it was Leo’s hair Jurand’s\nlong fingers were tangled in, and Leo’s ear he was biting at, whispering at,\nand Leo’s legs he was reaching down between…\n“Leo?”\nHe turned his shoulder towards his wife, so she wouldn’t see the blood\nhad rushed to his face. And not only his face.\n“I suppose… I’ll just have to separate… their preferences from their\nvalue.” Certainly it would feel good to have someone beside him he could\nrely on. Someone who could make him smile again, even. With a grunt of\nrelief, he finally pulled open the last buckle and the iron leg clattered to the\nfloor. “I’ll write to Jurand.”\n“Good. You’ve changed, too.” Savine lifted the baby from her breast, its\ntiny eyes flickering with ecstasy, and plumped it down next to the other. She\nwas doing her dress back up when that one stirred, began to squeak. She\ngritted her teeth and started to unbutton again.\nLeo winced, and looked away, and was able to sit up without\nembarrassing himself. Luckily, perhaps, there was nothing he found less\narousing than his wife’s swollen, veiny, leaking tits. “You should get a\nnurse,” he said. Or at least she should do that somewhere he didn’t have to\nsee it.\n“I want to do it myself.”\n“Well, you’re in tune with the times.” Leo rubbed ever so gently at his\naching stump. “The Assembly never stops blathering about the proper\nresponsibilities of a Citizeness. The sublime duty of motherhood, Risinau\ncalls it.”\nSavine snorted. “Fuck that fool.”\nThere was a green space outside the Agriont where they’d taken to dumping\nthe old statues.

Noseless, handless, legless lords and ladies who’d once\npresided over palaces now ruled over a stretch of patchy grass that smelled\nof the rotting water-weed in the bottom of the drained moat. Here or there\nsome monstrous remnant from the famous statues on the Kingsway loomed\nover the rest. A towering hand. A mighty boot. Half a majestic sneer.\nLeo had pushed himself too hard, as usual. He sat on the fist of Harod\nthe Great, his iron leg stretched out in front of him. He was desperate to\nunbuckle the bloody instrument of torture but doubted he’d get it back on\nwithout help. He watched the workmen on their teetering scaffold chiselling\naway at the battlements of the Agriont—an endless, pointless, impossible\ntask of demolition. The mornings were turning chilly and he huddled into\nhis coat, blew smoke into his good hand. Even up in the North, he never\nused to feel the cold. Now it was in his bones all the time.\nHe heard footsteps crunching in the frost-stiff grass and caught hold of\nhis cane to rise. “Chairman Risinau—”\n“Don’t get up, Citizen, don’t get up!”\nLeo sagged back with some relief. Getting up was no simple matter\nthese days. He watched the Chairman’s frowning guards take up their\npositions, still as the broken statues. “Thank you for seeing me.”\n“We are honoured to have a hero of your calibre among us!” Did a true\nword ever leave this bastard’s fat mouth? He’d no respect for Leo at all, and\ntheir causes had never been a bit alike, but there were still people who’d\ncheer for the Young Lion, and Risinau wanted their support. His own was\nstarting to crumble.\n“I’m the one who’s honoured,” said Leo, matching lie for lie. “To be\ngiven a seat on the Assembly. A place in your great endeavour.”\n“I did not bring all this about simply to see oppressors and oppressed\ntrade places. It is equality I want! True equality.” And Risinau happily\nfingered the rich fur he wore. “All must be represented in the Assembly.\nEven those we might once have considered rivals. Even those we might\nonce have considered enemies. Look around us, after all.” And he pointed\nout the great bald head of Bayaz, on its side in the grass, an optimistic little\ngrowth of ivy already making its way up his stony top lip. “A graveyard of\nideas. The lies of the past swept away, to make way for all our futures!”\n“You have the nation’s gratitude for that,” said Leo. “I’m not what you’d\ncall eloquent—”\n“You do yourself a disservice!” Risinau wagged a fat finger at him. “I\nhave been most impressed with your contributions in the Assembly thus\nfar.”\n“I’m just a blunt soldier. Or… I was.”\n“And now?”\n“And now…” Leo paused. Plainly he was no soldier.

A double blessing! You must congratulate your\nwife for me. There is no higher contribution a woman can make to the\nnation than the fruit of her womb, would you not agree?”\n“She certainly would.” Leo smiled as he imagined her kicking him in the\nface for his fucking cheek. “Fatherhood has made me think about the world\nI’ll leave to my children. The truth is… I’m worried about Angland.”\n“I, too,” said Risinau. “I, too.”\n“A gulf has opened between Midderland and the provinces. I blame\nmyself, in part. But it goes back a long way. I don’t want to see it widen. I\nhate to think the province of my birth might… break away from the Union.”\n“Unthinkable,” said Risinau, the slightest dangerous gleam in his eye.\n“You’re so right. When I was Governor there…” Leo didn’t think the\nword “Lord” would help his case. “I tried to move Angland forward.” Or\nSavine had persuaded him to look like he was trying. “New labour laws,\nfairer taxes.”\n“I am aware and admire your efforts.”\n“Small steps beside all you’ve achieved. But I want to help bring them\nthe rest of the way. To bury the past.” He gestured towards Bayaz’s fallen\nhead, just the way Risinau had. “To lead them into the future you’re\nbuilding.”\nThe Chairman put the tip of one finger to his thoughtfully pursed lips.\n“You think you can coax your erstwhile countrymen back into the fold?”\n“I have to try. Let me write to my mother. Assure her of your good\nintentions. Assure her that I, and my wife, and her grandchildren, are here\nas willing believers in your cause.” Leo winced as he leaned hard on his\ncane and stood, so he could speak as one friend to another. “Let me bring\nlike-minded men to represent the province in the Assembly.

Chisels tapped in the\nbackground. Leo used to be always restless. Following an argument had\nbeen painful. Sitting still had been torture. Now he knew what torture really\nwas, and he was happy to wait. When every movement hurts, you come to\nappreciate a little stillness.\nThen Risinau smiled. “Young Lion, I feared you would be an obstacle to\nour Great Change. I knew we needed you, because of your popularity with\nthe people and the nobles, because of your value to your mother, but I was\nsure I would have to drag you bodily with us into the future!” He seized\nLeo by the shoulders, sending a stab of pain through his leg. “Now I see I\nhave in you a kindred spirit!” And he dragged Leo close, into his smell of"

I’ve brought two new children into the world, but you’ve\nbrought a whole new nation.”\n“An apt metaphor, Young Lion! No birth happens without pain. Without\nblood. Without risk. They are joyous occasions even so!”\n“But newborns are so fragile,” said Leo. “They must be protected.”\n“Such insight.” Risinau looked at him with something close to\nadmiration. “Such insight! Write your letters, Citizen Brock! I will see them\ndelivered. We will stride into the new future together!” He slapped Leo on\nthe shoulder as he turned away and strode off with his guards following.\n“We’ll hop into it, at least,” muttered Leo. Looking down, he saw his\nuseless arm had dropped loose without him even noticing, the pale hand\ndangling. He had to lurch to Bayaz’s head and lean awkwardly against the\nmagus’s nose, breathing hard, before he could stuff his hand back between\nthe buttons of his coat.\nAnger\n“I\nf it isn’t Inspector Teufel.” Gunnar Broad hadn’t got any smaller. And he\nstill had the lenses and the Ladderman’s tattoo. But he looked harder,\nsomehow. Or maybe hard times had ground the softness off and revealed\nthe man beneath.\n“If it isn’t Captain Broad.”\nHe peered unhappily at the badges of rank on his sleeve. “No notion\nhow that particular folly came about.”\n“You could say the same for most things these days.” She planted her\nhands on her hips, pressed her thumb-tip into the stiff one and frowned out\nacross the bridge. She couldn’t see them yet, but she could hear them. That\nfamiliar sound of anger on its way. “Seems we keep meeting. And in shitty\ncircumstances.”\n“They’re the only kind I get.” Broad wiped his lenses, then hooked them\ncarefully back over his ears. “But no worse’n I deserve, I guess.”\n“Well, I’m glad you’re not holding a grudge.” Vick thought of the last\ntime she saw him, with the Brocks, before the Battle of Stoffenbeck.\nNoblemen fighting against a king. Seemed a different world. “Last time we\nmet, you called me a traitor.”\n“Aye, well, I’ve said a lot of shit in my time that didn’t add up to much.”\nShe could see the people now, tramping out of the murk on the other\nside of the bridge. Protest, strike or riot, it was hard to say. Harder than\never. They were armed, in a way. Tools and planks and bars. One had a pick\nwith a string of sausages hanging from it. Not weapons of war, exactly, but\ntell that to someone who gets clubbed over the head with a shaping\nhammer. Looked like a lot of them were drunk, but then a lot of folk were\nthese days.

Drink was the one thing still cheap.\n“Let’s remember they’re just people, eh?” Vick called over her shoulder.\n“Try not to kill anyone.”\n“You reckon they’ve had the same orders?” muttered Broad, sliding his\nshield onto his arm and gripping the handle. Vick doubted it. Lot of them\nwore red. Red hats, red sleeves, coats spattered with red paint. Burners,\nthen. Or at any rate expressing preferences in the Burning direction. You\nsaw more and more of it. People’s patience was wearing thin. Who could\nblame them?\n“There’s a lot o’ the bastards,” muttered Tallow, peering around Vick’s\nshoulder. He’d got a Constable’s uniform and a Constable’s stick, but it was\nhard to imagine him doing much good with either one as he gazed across\nthe bridge with those big, sad eyes.\n“Stay behind Captain Broad,” she snapped at him. Honestly, behind\nCaptain Broad was looking a pretty appealing place to her right then.\n“They look bloody angry,” squeaked Tallow.\nHard to say exactly what they were angry about. No doubt they all had\ntheir own recipe. Price of bread. Price of housing. Price of fuel as the\nweather got colder. Wages too low, hours too high, too many laws or too\nfew. Pike had taught them a lesson—if enough people got angry enough,\nthey could change things. Now anger was the answer to everything.\nThe Great Change had been a basket of dreams. A bouquet of promises.\nAll things to all men. Which was grand until, against all expectations, the\nBreakers won. Then, all of a sudden, it wasn’t enough just to have a change,\nit had to be a change into something. Trouble was, soon as you tried to\nactually deliver the bastard, to mould it into policies, with costs as well as\nbenefits, and losers as well as winners, well, nine-tenths of folk found the\nGreat Change wasn’t the change they’d wanted after all and wouldn’t\nfucking have it.\n“I could tire of the wisdom of crowds,” Vick whispered to herself.\nTallow was right, there were a lot of them and they all looked angry. She\nfelt an urge to glance over her shoulder and count Broad’s men, but she\nfixed her eyes ahead, feet planted wide. She told herself this was her bridge.\n“Hit ’em now?” she heard Broad grunt.\nThere was a big part of Vick that wanted to say yes, but she forced it\ndown. Someone had to. “Let’s try talking first.”\n“I’ve a feeling words won’t solve this.”\n“They’ll leave no one crippled, either,” she murmured, then roared as\nloud as she could, spraying spit. “That’s far enough!”\nThey gathered uncertainly at the far end of the bridge, frowning across\nthe damp stones at her as the first drops of a chilly rain sprinkled the\ncobbles. There were all sorts mixed in there. A crook-back old man with no\nshoes. A scrawny boy with his hollow cheeks blotched from the cold. A\npregnant girl wearing a damp newsbill as a bonnet."

Vick clenched her teeth and took a hard breath. “Look, I\nget it! You’re disappointed! You’re frustrated! Let’s face it, you’re fucking\nfurious! Believe me, so am I.”\nA woman shouldered through the press ahead. Big pink fists clutching a\nwooden paddle. A laundress. Hard women, those. Vick reckoned if she\nspent all day with her hands in hot water she’d be angry, too. “We don’t\nneed talk!” she howled. “We need bread!”\nThere was an answering growl of approval from the crowd, and an old\nman shook a placard, and a little girl up on someone’s shoulders screeched,\n“Fuck the Closed Council!” which somewhat missed the boat since all the\nones they could catch had been hanged a few weeks before.\nVick showed one palm and let the noise die down, then she fixed that\nlaundry-woman with her eye and searched hard for the right words. The\nones Malmer might’ve picked. The ones Sibalt might’ve found.\n“I understand,” she said, and she did, for what that was worth. “You\nwere promised a better world, and all you’ve got so far is the same old shit.\nYou can’t fill your belly with promises. You can’t warm your house with\nhopes. You’re tired of being told lies! Believe me, so am I.” Or she was\ntired of telling lies, at least. So bloody tired of it. “But we’ve got a chance\nhere!” Ridiculous, that it fell to her, who never let herself hope for anything,\nto try to kindle some hope in these bastards, but she gave it all she had, her\nvoice cracking. “A chance to build something better. We just have to be\npatient. Have to—”\nSomething came spinning from the crowd, missed her by a stride and\nclonked from the shield of one of Broad’s men. They almost charged then.\nShe could feel their fury, harder to hold in than to release, like dogs\nstraining at the leash, but Vick held up a trembling hand, giving it one last\ngo, preaching patience while she fast ran out of it.\n“Go home!” Her voice came out a warning growl, and she took one step\nforwards, soles of her boots grinding against the stones, while behind her\nback she slipped her fingers into her brass knuckles. “Because I tell you\nwhat—anyone tries to cross this bridge will regret it.”\n“Maybe you’ll be the one with the regrets!” called a sly-looking bastard,\nwearing a tall hat with half the felt worn off and gripping an old piece of\niron railing. “Thought o’ that?”\n“I’ll file ’em with the others,” snarled Vick.\nSomething else came flying at her.

As if it had been a signal, the two sides\ncharged screaming at each other, meeting in the middle of the bridge with a\nclattering and shattering, a thudding of sticks and chair-legs and workmen’s\ntools.\nThat laundress came right at Vick, lifting her paddle high. “Fuck you!”\n“Fuck you.” Vick slipped around the paddle and punched the woman in\nthe throat with her brass knuckles, left her clutching at her neck, eyes\nbulging. The safe thing would’ve been to go for her knee and bring her\ndown, but when it came to anger, Vick was not immune.\nWhen the mob broke into the Agriont, they’d ransacked her mean little\nset of rooms. They’d taken what there was to take, which wasn’t much,\nsmashed what there was to smash, which wasn’t much more, and left that\nridiculous book Sibalt used to love torn on the floor. It had made her oddly\nfurious.\nSo Vick punched this bitch in the face, snapped her head back, punched\nher again, and she tripped over someone’s outstretched leg and went down\nhard. She tried to get up, blood streaming from her nose, and Vick planted a\nboot on her chest and shoved her back down. “Stick to laundry,” she said.\nThere might’ve been a lot of them, and they might’ve been angry, but on\nthe bridge there was no way the rioters could make their numbers tell.\nBroad’s men were all veterans and they formed an armoured line, shoving\nwith shields, beating with sticks, trampling the fallen, making no distinction\nbetween perpetrators and bystanders, between rioters and demonstrators,\ntrampling the lot just the same.\nVick heard cries further back, the Constables she’d sent around spilling\nfrom a side street and straight into the rioters’ flank. They came apart like a\nflock of starlings, taunts turned to whimpers, tossing down weapons and\npamphlets and stolen food, crushing each other in their panic, one man\nknocked over the parapet, shrieking as he splashed into the canal. Here was\nthe wisdom of crowds, and the courage of crowds, too.\n“All right!” bellowed Vick, hopping up on the parapet and waving her\narms. “That’s enough.” One of the Constables had a look of glee plastered\nacross his face as he kicked the snot out of a scrawny boy. “I said enough!”\nShe dragged him clear, near got an elbow in the face for her pains.\nThe anger could whip up in no time. But it could leak away just as fast.\nThose who weren’t running were a sorry sight now. All hanging heads and\nwobbly lips, like children caught talking after bedtime.\nVick grabbed Tallow by the shoulder. “Pick out some ringleaders. And\nsomeone fish that idiot out of the canal!”\nHe blinked at her. “How do I tell who the ringleaders are?”\n“They’ll be the ones you’re pointing at.”\nBroad dragged the sly one up by his jacket, hat knocked off and blood\nrunning from a cut on his scalp. “You fucking bitch—” he snarled at Vick."

If they were still calling it that. “Get this arsehole to the House of\nTruth.”\nBroad plucked a pamphlet from the man’s pocket, then shoved him\ntowards the Constables so they could clap the irons on him. “One o’\nSworbreck’s, I reckon.”\n“Don’t tell me,” said Vick as he peered at the ill-printed pages through\nhis lenses. “The Great Change didn’t solve every problem, so the answer\nmust be more of it.”\n“That’s about the gist,” said Broad, crumpling the pamphlet in his big\nfist and tossing it away. “That was a nice speech you gave, by the way.”\nVick worked the brass knuckles from her aching fingers and frowned\naround at the mess. “Didn’t do much good.”\n“Did a little for me. You can’t fill your belly with promises.” Broad\nnudged his lenses up his nose, slowly nodding. “Reminded me o’ Malmer.”\nVick took a long breath. “Look where he ended up.”\n“It’s chaos out there,” snapped Vick. She still felt angry. Like she’d been\ntricked. Tricked into believing things could be different. When the truth was\nshe’d only tricked herself.\nCommissioner Pike looked calmly back at her from across his desk. The\nsame bare, stark room from which Arch Lector Glokta had ruled the Union,\nsome of its furniture still bearing the scars of the day the Agriont fell.\nBehind the mirrored halls, and the velvet curtains, and the gilt façades, the\nreal decisions always seemed to be made in bare, stark rooms.\n“I understand there have been some disturbances,” he droned, with his\nusual flare for understatement.\n“A mob hanged two coal merchants the other day. They were already\nselling as cheap as they could. Prices are higher than before the Great\nChange. Higher than they’ve ever been. Folk broke into a shop, paid what\nthey thought was fair. Then someone said they were profiteers. So they\nhanged ’em. Then they marched up the street to the flour merchant.”\n“And committed outrages against his person?”\n“Luckily for him, I got in the way.”\n“You, as far as I can tell, remain unhanged.”\n“Luckily for me, there were some Breakers there who knew how to\nbreak heads as well as chains.”\n“Then make sure you take some with you next time.”\n“That’s your solution? Armed men on the streets? Wasn’t that the\nproblem with the old regime?”\n“We cannot blame everything on the old regime. Some problems, and\nsome solutions, are simply… the way people are. We can have no illusions,\nafter what we have seen, you and I, about the way people are.”"

We must not be distracted. There is still\nso much work to do. In the bureaucracy. In the banks.”\n“Really?”\n“Corruption has eaten into every part of Union society. No one can be\ntruly free until it is burned away. Replaced with… pure institutions.”\n“Is there any such thing?”\nPike gave that twitch of his mouth that passed for a smile. “So cynical,\nInspector. It is what makes you such a fine investigator. But we are\nchanging the world. There were bound to be… teething pains.”\n“We’re talking about dead shopkeepers. Not teeth. There are parts of the\ncity we don’t go into at night. There are parts of the city we have to ask the\nBurners’ permission to go into at all.”\nPike let a breath sigh away, as though dead shopkeepers were an\ninconvenient by-product, like the slag from a foundry. “You never struck\nme as a worrier, Inspector Teufel.”\n“Then when I worry you should take me seriously.”\n“I would take your solutions more seriously still.”\nThat gave Vick pause. In all those years she’d worked for Glokta, she’d\nnever once been asked for a solution.\nPike stared back at her, eyes flinty hard. “You should feel free to speak\nyour mind.”\n“Without consequences?”\n“Without consequences, a solution is merely an opinion.” He curled his\nlip in the direction of the Commons’ Round. “Of those, we have a surfeit.”\n“Risinau has to go!” Vick blurted out, smashing Pike’s desk with her\nsore hand. Breaking all her rules, maybe, but there was no going back now.\n“He’s got no grip. He blathers on about making people free like that’s the\nanswer to every problem. But all he’s done is give them the chance to kill\nwhoever they blame.”\n“Someone must lead, Inspector. Who would you put in the chair\ninstead?”\nShe knew she couldn’t say what she was starting to think—that the\nGreat Change was in danger of becoming a change for the greatly worse\nand that King Orso was beginning to look a paragon of leadership. She\nsettled for second best. Or for second least worst, maybe. “You’re the\nWeaver. You started this.”\n“So I could give power to the people. Not so I could seize it for myself. I\nnever wanted to be in charge.”\n“Can I ask what you did want?”\n“The same as you. The same as all of us.” He did not smile. He did not\nfrown. “A better world.”\nOpportunities\nS\navine used to flit from one engagement to the next.

She had hunted through every box and drawer, rationed\nher dwindling supplies as best she could, but now she had run entirely dry,\nand without it she was twitchy and sluggish at once and had a constant\nheadache.\nShe told herself it had nothing to do with fear. There was no tide of sick\ndread when she considered stepping over the threshold. No swallowing the\nmemories of the uprising in Valbeck, or the battlefield at Stoffenbeck, or the\nfall of the Agriont.\nShe told herself she could leave whenever she pleased. But what for?\nShe had everything she needed here.\nShe smiled down at Ardee, fast asleep in her cot. She could watch them\nsleep for hours. Sit holding them for hours. Kiss the dark fuzz on their\nheads, over and over, and be delighted by the feeling every time. The smell\nof them. The softness of them. The unformed innocence of—\nThe bell tinkled downstairs and she felt a stab of panic, whipping\naround, hand at her throat, mouth sour with terror. She hardly even knew\nwhat enemies to expect. She crept to the window, brushing back the curtain\nwith a finger, peering towards the road that used to be the Middleway. She\nunderstood they were still arguing over its new name, in the Assembly.\nIt was better not to mention things unless you were sure of the right\nlanguage. Every day brought new wrong words to avoid. New ideas at odds\nwith the Great Change. Everyone was free to say what they wanted now, of\ncourse. You just had to be careful in case it got you hanged.\nThere was a heavy quiet, out there. Her hearing was constantly\nsharpened for that first hint of an angry crowd. That first warning of riot and\nviolence. She had not been sleeping, that was all. The twins were so\ndemanding. And not a sniff of pearl dust anywhere in the city. She let the\ncurtain drop, then jerked around at Zuri’s voice.\n“I found two beggars wandering the streets,” she said, with the trace of a\nplayful smile, “and my scripture teacher always told me that charity is the\nfirst of virtues, so I thought I would show them in…”\nSavine felt a flood of relief as Zuri pushed the door wide to reveal her\ntwo brothers. The Great Change did not appear to have changed them, at\nleast. Haroon was as solid and serious, and Rabik as smooth-faced and\nsmiling, as ever.\nHer first instinct was to rush over and hug them. She even took a step to\ndo it before she remembered herself. “No one could be more welcome,” she\nsaid, and she meant it.\nHaroon bowed his head. “We are glad to be back with you.”\n“And to see you so blessed.” Rabik leaned over Harod’s cot, making\nlittle kisses, then peered beaming into Ardee’s. “So doubly blessed.”\n“I am sorry it took us so long to come.

With no beliefs of\nher own, she wanted at least to believe in someone else’s.\n“I used to think my faith was unshakeable. When I was a soldier…”\nHaroon gave the slightest wince, as though at an unpleasant taste. “I did\nthings in the name of God and never doubted. Things… I have come to very\nmuch regret.”\n“We all have regrets,” murmured Savine. Haroon at least could blame\nGod for his. She could only blame herself.\n“Faith must be shaken from time to time, or it becomes rigid. An excuse\nfor any outrage. I have come to believe that the righteous… should always\nhave doubts.”\nRabik took Savine’s hand in both of his and smiled. Such an open,\nhonest, beautiful smile. “We must have faith in each other,” he said simply.\nIt was enough to make her smile herself.\n“Citizen Kort is here,” said Zuri, from the door.\n“Kort?” The name floated up from the distant past. As if a visit from\ngreat Juvens had been announced. Savine prodded ineffectually at her wig,\ntrying to scrape together some shreds of her old self-assurance as Zuri’s\nbrothers left the room. “Show him in… I suppose.”\n“Lady Savine!” Kort had prospered, that was clear. His clothes were\nsimply cut, of course, since simplicity was the fashion, but she knew\nexpensive cloth when she saw it, and the broken-chain pin he wore to show\nallegiance with the common man was set with little diamonds.\n“Citizeness Savine.” She used to be able to calibrate her smile with all\nthe accuracy of a gunner ranging his cannon. Now it felt clumsy on her\nface, like a once-favourite pair of boots that no longer quite fit.\nHis eyes flickered only briefly to the scar on her forehead, and his own\nsmile did not slip at all. “Whichever it is, you are as beautiful as ever.”\nNimbly done, since she wore a shapeless bag of a nursing dress, was bleary\nfrom lack of sleep and not painted or powdered at all.

He\nproves to be a fine speaker.” Kort smiled beneficently down. “And this is?”\n“My daughter, Ardee.” Savine felt absurdly proud of her children and\ndelighted in showing them off, even to people whose opinions she could not\nhave cared less about. “Named after my mother. And almost as\ndemanding.”\n“I am an engineer, and don’t always see the appeal in babies, but this…”\nAnd he poked one thick finger at her. “This is a well-favoured infant!”\nLittle Ardee had only just begun to focus her eyes, but she focused hers\non Kort’s ruddy face now with her mouth suspiciously pursed. Evidently an\nexcellent judge of character already.\n“And this is my son, Harod.” Savine led Kort to the other cot. “Named\nfor Leo’s father.”\n“Not for the first King of the Union, then?”\n“I doubt that would be in keeping with the times.”\n“Certainly our most recent monarch finds himself short of support. Aside\nfrom a few die-hards in the east of Midderland, no one even bows to him\nany more, let alone kneels.”\n“We are all equal now…” Though it had not been long ago that Savine\nhad knelt before the king to beg for her husband’s life, and not long before\nthat she had knelt before him in Sworbreck’s office for… other reasons.\n“I hear they have him shut up in six rooms of the palace, under constant\nguard,” Kort was crowing. “He has to ask permission to use the latrine.\nImagine that!”\nSavine did not care to. Orso had shown mercy to her and her husband,\nhowever little they deserved it. More mercy than she would have shown, in\nhis place. She wondered what the future held for him, as the Breakers\ntightened their grip. As people forgot the past. As they needed him less and\nless as a reassuring figurehead.

If they\nlearned her children were the grandchildren of King Jezal…\nKort flicked out the tails of his coat to sit. “It seems that motherhood\nvery much agrees with you.”\n“Somewhat to my surprise.”\n“Not to mine.

She waited a moment, but there was\nnothing. “We must change, too.”\n“I could not agree more.” Kort’s bulk had subsided into his chair, but\nnow he eased it earnestly towards her. “And the greater the change, the\ngreater the opportunities. Commissioner Pike seems fixed on crushing the\nbanks. Between the lack of credit, the price of bread, the interruption in coal\nsupplies from Angland… through nothing but buying and selling shrewdly,\nfortunes can be made in a day! And for those who know the right people,\nsee the right openings, those who can actually bring goods into Adua…\nSelest dan Heugen—”\n“There are no ‘dans’ any more, remember?”\n“Whatever her name is, she’s adjusted to the new reality like lightning.\nShe’s dispensed with the wigs, it’s all about honesty now, apparently, and\nshe’s not even a redhead, would you believe?”\n“I am astonishment itself.”\n“But she wears a red sash! In sympathy with the bloody Burners, and\ntalks as though she’s been arguing for the Great Change for years while\nshe’s making an absolute fortune buying flour in the provinces. They say\nthe weather will only get colder, and the royalists are about in the east,\nburning crops. Lord Marshal Forest and his men, refusing to lay down their\narms. Everything will get scarcer. With our canal, we—”\n“No.”\n“No? Motherhood has changed you.”\n“On the contrary, I have always been extremely careful about which\nopportunities I take, and which I turn down.” She lowered her voice,\nglancing towards the window again. “When they have hanged all their\nenemies, do you think they will stop? Things will unravel and they will\nneed people to blame. Do you read the pamphlets? They print more than\never! Attacking aristocrats, and foreign agents, and speculators and hoarders\nand profiteers. Attacking everyone!” She thought of the mob, the clawing\narm slithering through her broken carriage window. “I will not be making\nmyself conspicuous. I strongly advise you to do the same.”\nKort stared at her, his mouth ajar. “I never supposed that you, of all\npeople, would lack the nerve to seize what is right in front of you. Lady\nSavine—”\n“Citizeness Savine.”\n“There are such opportunities—”\n“Haroon will see you out.”\nZuri’s older brother had eased silently into the room. His head was\nrespectfully bowed, his smile almost apologetic, but there was something in\nthe set of his broad shoulders, in the way one strong hand clasped the other,\nthat made it clear it was time to go. He was almost as good as his sister at\nsaying it all without saying a word.\nKort blinked at him, then gave a sigh, and heaved himself to his feet. “I\nfear you will regret this.”"

She frowned as she\nsank down, unbuttoning the flap of her dress so she could scoop out one\nsore, sticky breast.\n“Damn it,” she growled as he chewed at her. You would never imagine\nthey had no teeth for the pain they could thoughtlessly inflict.\nShe had been the most envied woman in the Union. Now here she was,\ntrapped in a few rooms like the prisoner-king, milking herself like a farmer\nmilks a cow. For the benefit of these two thankless little monsters, she had\nmade herself a supporting character in her own life. Had the room always\nbeen this hot? She felt suffocated.\nThere was a crash outside and she gasped, nearly jumped up, staring\ntowards the window, half-straightened legs trembling. Voices out there.\nShouts. Then laughter, dying away. Disturbed in his feeding, Harod had\nstarted to cry. She settled herself, put him back to her breast, his head\nfishing desperately for what was right in front of him.\nSavine found herself wondering what her parents would have said, if\nthey could have seen her now. Making no plans. Taking no steps. Exerting\nno grip. Kort was hardly the shrewdest social operator, but even he had\nseen it at once. She had lost her nerve. Inevitable, perhaps, given all she had\nbeen through. But headaches or not, pearl dust or not, fears or not, she\ncould not afford to hide away here, smiling wanly at her sleeping babies.\nFretting over what would happen to Orso. Living in a drowsy, deadened,\nmilk-smelling fug while the world collapsed around her. Then wetting\nherself with fright at every noise.\nThat was not protecting herself. That was not protecting her children.\nThat was not caution, it was cowardice. It was surrender.\nSavine forced her shoulders down. Her chin up. The posture she used to\nhave, when she ruled the Solar Society. Or as close as she could get to it.\n“Zuri?” she called, and her voice was harsh. Not the tone in which she\ncooed at her babies. The tone in which she once blackmailed her rivals.\nIt only took a moment for Zuri to appear, opening the book and sliding\nher pencil from behind her ear. “What can I do?”\n“Could Rabik find out what dressmakers are still alive and in business?\nThis…” and she looked down at the milk-stained flap of her dress, hanging\nopen like torn sacking, “will not do. I need a proper face-maid, too. A clever\none.”\n“One who can make the paint look like there is no paint.” And Zuri\nturned towards the door, scribbling a note.

Have Haroon see if we can buy some bakeries. I\nunderstand it is dangerous work these days. Lots of them selling up.” She\nwas standing now, pacing up and down, rocking Harod and feeding him and\nthinking all at once. “Then I will talk to Leo about coal. See if he can bridge\nhis mother and the Assembly, open up the supply from Angland again.”\nThere was that little silence Zuri left to register her concern, pencil\nhovering over paper. “Playing the markets would be quite the risk in the\ncurrent climate. Hoarders are being lynched, and I understand the Assembly\nplans to outlaw speculation—”\n“I am not going to sell it.”\n“Then—”\n“My scripture teacher tells me that charity is the first of virtues.”\nZuri’s black brows were raised very high. “She sounds exceedingly\nwise.”\n“She is. And my very good friend Honrig Curnsbick always tells me I\nhave a generous heart. So I have decided to give it away. I want to go out\ninto the poorest districts, and… give it away.”\nSavine had always thought that people who were liked were simply not\ntrying hard enough to be envied. But it had not been her money that saved\nthem, when the People’s Army stormed the Agriont. It had been Leo’s\npopularity. It was high time she had some of her own. Perhaps she could\neven do some good, for whatever that was worth.\nZuri gently shook her head. “If you had told me a year ago we would be\ngiving anything away…”\n“There has been a Great Change, Zuri. We must change— Ah!” She\ngasped as Harod chewed at her nipple again, pulled him angrily away and\nhe started to cry. That helpless, desperate cry that felt like nails hammered\ndirectly into her red-rimmed eyes.\n“Fuck,” she snapped, pushing her sore breast back inside her dress and\nfumbling with the buttons on the other side, “and for the Fates’ sakes, find\nme a reliable nurse. I can’t manage them both alone.”\nAn Exhibit\n“R\neally?” asked Orso as the plate was flung violently down in front of\nhim. A piece of rancorous matter he did not dare describe as meat, some\ncarrots virtually raw and some peas boiled to mush, all thoroughly cooled\non the labyrinthine voyage from the kitchens to the remote corner of the\npalace which had become his prison.\nThe cook leaned down over him, her jaw jutting. “Do I look like I’m\njoking?”\n“Rarely if ever,” squeaked Orso, shrinking back.\nOf all the things he missed about before, it was his cook Bernille that\ngave him the sharpest pangs of loss. Those delicate soups. Those miniature\npastries. The things she had done with shellfish! Positively indecent. He\nwondered what had become of her and her extensive staff.

Orso frowned. Might they even be happier\ncooking for someone else? Might they have had no choice but to put on\nthose sweaty smiles? Might that kitchen have been a prison to them?\n“Enjoying your dinner, Your Majesty?”\nOrso tried to ignore his audience entirely but, as usual, he couldn’t help\nglancing up. A few days before, they had opened the palace to tours. The\npeople had paid for the place, Risinau had told the Assembly, with their\nblood and tears, so it belonged to the people, and they should be allowed to\nenjoy it. Even the miserable set of attics in which Orso was now confined,\nwith its split floorboards, peeling wallpaper and rich festoons of cobweb,\nrestlessly stirring in the constant chill draft. The Assembly evidently\nbelieved that the monarch was public property, too, and had determined to\nmake an exhibit of him. Now a constant queue filed in through one door,\ngawped at him from behind a railing and filed out through another.\nThey laughed, and pointed, and Orso acknowledged them with a weary\nsmile. “One humiliation after another,” he murmured, flicking open his\nnapkin, tucking it ever so delicately into his collar, and letting Hildi nudge\nthe little table towards him. She had to slip a dog-eared political pamphlet\nunder a loose leg to stop it wobbling.\n“Thank you, Hildi. Everyone else might have forgotten themselves, but\nthere’s really no need to let one’s own standards slide.”\n“Couldn’t agree more.” Hildi leaned close to whisper, “Managed to get\nyou some of the good bread today.” And she slipped a slice onto his plate.\n“Hildi, you absolute treasure.”\n“Don’t flatter me too much, you owe me two marks for the loaf.”\n“Bloody hell!” Orso had rarely indeed been called upon to spare much\nthought for the price of things, but that struck even him as steep. “Our tab\nmust be soaring.”\n“Everything’s dear these days.”\n“Especially to kings,” he murmured, forking over that slice of bread and\nstarting to carve it up. Somehow it tasted better if he treated it with the\nsame ceremony as one of Bernille’s wonderful cuts of beef.\n“He should fucking dance for us.”\nOrso couldn’t help glancing up, yet again. A man with a tall hat perched\nat a ridiculous angle leaned on the railing to leer at him, an overpainted\nwoman giggling as she clung to his elbow.\n“Good one, Shawley!”\nOrso gave that weary smile again. Or at any rate it was still clinging to\nhis face from last time. “A very good one,” he said. “But I only dance with\ncountesses and above, I’m afraid.”\n“We don’t have lords or ladies here no more,” said Shawley.\n“Then unless you’re foreign nobility I fear you’re out of luck.” And\nOrso raised his glass to them. “Cheers.”\nSome of the onlookers chuckled. Shawley decidedly did not. “We’ll see\nwho’s out of luck, I reckon, in the end.”"

A man called\nHalder, blessed with even less sense of humour than the cook. No one\nseemed to have much sense of humour these days. Or perhaps they were\nsimply no longer obliged to be merry in his presence.\nShawley looked even more put out. “I’ll move when I’m ready—”\n“You’ll move when I say,” said Halder. One of the other guards pulled\nout his heavy stick. “Or we’ll move you to the House o’ Truth.”\nShawley tipped his hat so far, the brim was virtually touching his sneer\nand slouched away with bad grace, the woman glaring balefully back over\nher shoulder.\n“Thank you so much for visiting!” called Orso, waving his fork at them.\n“Watch you don’t catch your cock in the door on your way out!”\nBiting into his meat cured him of any sense of triumph. It was like biting\ninto a boot sole. “I’m a bloody sideshow curiosity,” he murmured as he\nstruggled to chew and retain his teeth at once. “The heir to the throne of\nHarod the Great, with a clear bloodline from Arnault himself, made into a\nzoo animal.”\nHildi was too busy frowning towards the door. “Don’t look up,” she\nsaid, which had precisely the opposite effect, of course.\n“Oh, damn,” muttered Orso around a mouthful of carrot with the\nconsistency of firewood. Who should be leading the next batch of gawkers\nbut that noted member of the Assembly of Representatives, Corporal\nTunny?\n“He looks prosperous,” grumbled Hildi.\n“Debauchery is profitable under any government,” said Orso, trying and\nentirely failing to look as if he was relishing his vile meal.\n“Well, well, Your Majesty!” Tunny flashed his yellowed teeth. “It is\nalways a pleasure.”\n“You really didn’t have to visit me at home. We see more than enough of\neach other in the Assembly.”\n“Must say your quarters look rather humble for a monarch.” Tunny\nglanced up at a mouldy stain that spread out from one corner of the ceiling.\n“You should complain to Chairman Risinau.”\n“Ignore him,” said Orso, but Hildi could never stop leaping to his\ndefence. A singularly thankless task these days. She stalked towards the\nrailing, bristling.\n“Your entourage seems diminished.” Tunny peered down at her. “Never\ncould make up my mind whether she was one of your bastards or one of\nyour whores.”\n“Whereas I was always sure you were a cunt!” Hildi went for him, tried\nto claw at his face, but Tunny caught her arm and they tussled over the\nbarrier. Orso sprang up, making his plate rattle.\n“Step back from the railing,” grunted Halder.\nTunny shoved Hildi roughly away and she stumbled and fell, cracking\nher head.\n“You bastard!” snarled Orso, knife and fork clenched as though they\nwere long and short steels."

If there had\nbeen a fight, he honestly could not have said on whose side they would have\nintervened.\n“He’s not worth it.” Hildi scrambled up, guiding Orso back towards his\nchair. “I’m fine.”\n“I always knew he was a bastard, but that bastard.” Orso glowered\ntowards Tunny as he swanned out through the far door. “Betraying me is\none thing, everyone’s at it, but taunting you—that bastard. How could I\never have trusted him—”\nOut of sight below the tablecloth, he felt her hand slide into his lap.\nHe blinked at her, shocked. “Hildi, I think of you more like a little sister\n— Oh.”\nThere was something in her hand. A scrap of paper. Tunny must have\nslipped it to her in the scuffle. She gave him a significant glance from under\nher blonde lashes. “More wine, Your Majesty?”\n“I think I will. And pour a little for yourself as well, eh? We’ve both had\nquite the shock.”\nAs the vinegary vintage slopped into his glass, he hacked away at his\nchop, plate rattling, and peered down at the note on his leg, pencilled in a\nbold hand.\nApologies for the scorn. Apologies for anything said in the Assembly.\nApologies to Hildi for the shove. Sorry Hildi! They have to think I am\nagainst you.\nI am in touch with Forest.

When the time is right, I will\nhave your standard ready.\nWith best wishes,\n(always) Your Friend and Servant, (always) Corporal Tunny\n“By the Fates.” Orso wondered for a moment if it could be some\nelaborate ruse, but to what end? No. He knew the truth. The notoriously\nfaithless Corporal Tunny was the one truly loyal man in Adua.\n“How the hell could I ever have doubted him?” he whispered, tears\nbrimming in his eyes. Halder was frowning over, and Orso took a long sniff\nand waved at his plate with his fork.\n“It’s these peas,” he said, in a quavering voice. “They’ve been\nabsolutely murdered.”\nThe man gave a snort.

And thanks to Corporal Tunny, not to mention Lord Marshal\nForest, his sister Carlot and Bremer dan Gorst, it seemed there was the\nglimmer of a chance that it might happen. Not today, perhaps, and not\ntomorrow, but the weather was turning cold. Soon enough, people would\nturn against Risinau. The man had simply promised too much and delivered\ntoo little.\nAs far as Orso could tell, he was incapable of delivering anything.\nHe laid down his cutlery, and carefully tore the note up into strips, and\nslipped them into his mouth, and chewed with relish. Without doubt, the\nmost enjoyable part of the meal.\n“Good news,” murmured Hildi, under her breath.\n“Very good news,” said Orso, around his papery mouthful, and he\nchinked his glass against hers.\nHe was not rescued and the world was not set to rights. Not by any\nmeans. But he could see a path to it. He was not alone. He was not\nforgotten.\nAnd he remembered how it felt, to have hope.\nDifferent This Time\nL\neo sat, fussing at a loose thread in the sleeve on his useless arm. A year\nago, he would’ve been pacing up and down. But pacing was another thing\nthat wasn’t worth the pain these days.\n“Are you sure about this house?” he grumbled. A fire crackled in the\ngrate, and it was warm and welcoming, and Savine would never have\npermitted a detail that wasn’t in the best taste, but you couldn’t have called\nit a grand room.\n“If I was not sure we would not be here. It sends the right message.”\n“That we’re of no account?”\n“That we are humble, responsible Citizens who have put the excess of\nthe past behind us and accepted that we are all equal.”\nLeo snorted. “Have you seen that bloody palace Selest dan Heugen’s\nhaving built? Or that town house of Isher’s? There are plenty of people still\nliving well.”\n“They may come to regret it,” said Savine. “How things look used to be\nthe difference between success and failure. In these times it might be the\ndifference between life and death.”\nLeo frowned at that painting of his grandfather, Lord Marshal Kroy,\ncramped now under a far lower ceiling. “You always loved fine things.”\nMeaning he’d realised now they were gone how much he’d liked them.\n“I loved fine things when they said the right things about me. Fine things\nsay the wrong thing now. And we are that much closer to the Agriont. It’s a\nshorter trip to the Assembly.”\nHe knew he should’ve been grateful. Instead, he felt faintly nettled. “I\ncan walk.”\n“I know. But it hurts you. Why walk further than you have to?”\n“To prove that I can,” he grunted, gripping the handle of his crutch.\nShe floated over his annoyance, as usual, which, as usual, only annoyed\nhim more. “In any case, the other house is filled.”\n“Tenants?”\n“Children.”\n“What?”\n“Have you seen how many of them are homeless in the city?” Honestly,"

Orphaned, abandoned, lacking the most basic necessities.\nForced to prey upon each other, to thieve, to sell themselves. Children\nstarving on our streets.”\nLeo frowned over at her. She’d shed her shapeless nursing clothes now\nand, despite a lack of jewels, looked mostly her sleek, sharp, ruthless old\nself. But then she’d serve up something like this. “So… the Darling of the\nSlums has opened an orphanage?”\nNow she looked nettled. As if she hated thinking of herself as a\nphilanthropist as much as he hated thinking of himself as a cripple. “They\njust need a chance. And we can give them one.”\n“Or at least appear to.”\n“Exactly.”\n“Well, I suppose you’re right.”\n“I usually am,” she said, which was where these conversations generally\nended up.\nThe chair seemed to buzz under him and a moment later there was a\nthrobbing boom, ornaments rattling on the mantle. They’d made pathetic\nprogress at demolishing the Agriont’s mighty walls with hammer and pick,\nso the Assembly had voted to move into the modern age and try blowing\nthem up with Gurkish Fire. Gravel was routinely raining out of the sky for\nstreets around as a result.\n“Fucking idiots,” he snarled at the window, grinding his crutch into the\ncarpet.\nHe felt Savine’s hand on his shoulder. That calming touch, just the\nfingertips. “All you need to do is apologise.”\n“I’m no bloody good at apologies,” wanting to shake her hand off but\nsomehow wanting it to stay both at once.\n“Apologise badly, then.”\n“Why should I be the one saying sorry?” Though he knew exactly why.\n“Because we need him.” Which was exactly why. “And you were a fool\nto push him away in the first place. If it helps, tell yourself you’re not\napologising for what you did, but for being a fool.”\n“I’m not sure that does help.”\n“Be charming. You can be charming, when you want to be. You charmed\nme.”\n“Really? The way I remember it, you seduced me, fell pregnant, then\ntalked me into a match.”\nA hint of an exasperated sigh, and Savine took her hand away. “Talk him\ninto a match, then.”\nThat felt like a dangerous choice of words somehow. Out in the hall, Leo\nheard an echoing knock on the door, felt an absurd surge of nerves. “Help\nme up.”\nSavine dragged him out of his chair, none too gently, and he winced as\nhe put his weight on his iron leg. He was right, he could walk. And she was\nright, it hurt.\n“I will be in the next room,” said Savine. “If you get into difficulty.”\n“What can you do?”\n“I’ll think of something.” And she shut the door behind her, leaving him\nalone.\nLeo stood, stump throbbing, blood thumping in his head.

He could hear\nvoices in the hall.\nHe wondered what pose to strike, but when you’ve only one leg, and\nthat’s a poor one, and one arm, and that has to grip a crutch, you haven’t\nmany options. So when the door clattered open and Haroon showed in\nLeo’s oldest friend, he was still standing lopsided in the middle of the\ncarpet with a quivery smile on his face.\n“Jurand!”\nLeo hadn’t been ready for the rush of feeling. He could hardly breathe\nfor it. He’d been stuck for months among traitors, thugs and cowards, and\nthe sight of that familiar, trustworthy face, as handsome as ever, was like a\nlamp in a pitch-black room. It felt as if a part of him that died at\nStoffenbeck—the best part of him, even—came suddenly to life again.\nWhat he wanted to do more than anything was lurch into Jurand’s arms\nand never let go of him. He was poised to do it. Then he saw the shock on\nhis friend’s face. His wide eyes flickered over the scars, the useless arm, the\niron leg, and it dropped on Leo with the weight of the Agriont’s falling\nwalls how ruined he was since the last time they saw each other. How\nbroken and disfigured. How utterly crippled.\nLeo turned away. Might’ve hidden his scarred face behind his left hand,\nif he could’ve pulled it from his jacket without help.\nHis words crept out in a nervous croak. “I can’t tell you… how glad I\nam you’re here—”\nThe shock had passed and Jurand’s jaw was angrily set. “I’m here\nbecause Lady Finree ordered me to come. Not because you asked me.”\nThat sank into the silence between them. Leo swallowed. Not long ago\nhis pride would’ve made him stomp from the room. But his pride must’ve\nbeen in his leg, as it hardly seemed to bother him these days. “How is she?”\n“Worried. Desperately worried, about you, but she doesn’t let it show.\nShe has to put Angland back together. I don’t know what would have\nhappened without her. She’s a great leader.”\nLeo flinched. “Far better than her son.”\n“You’d have a hard time arguing otherwise.”\nHe knew he couldn’t deny it. Being in his mother’s shadow used to feel\nunbearable. Now he saw how lucky he’d been to have her. He took a hard\nbreath and drew himself up. “I’m sorry, Jurand. I’m… I’m very sorry. For\nthe way it all turned out. If you’d been with me, at Stoffenbeck, things\nwould’ve been… well.” He frowned down at his leg. At his crutch. “I was a\nfool.”\nJurand didn’t break out the long-suffering smile he always used to find\nat Leo’s latest recklessness. The only hint of warmth in his face were the\nspots of colour from the heat of the fire after the chill outside.\n“You’re right for once,” he snapped. “You were a fool. A selfish fool,"

Honestly, I always thought…” He trailed\noff, hands opening and closing, frowning hard at the floor.\nLeo’s mouth was very dry. “Thought what?”\n“Who cares what I thought. I’m as big a fool as you are, in my own\nway.”\nLeo took an awkward step towards him, his metal ankle squeaking.\nWanted to reach out, comfort him, but he didn’t have the limbs for it.\n“You’re about the cleverest man I know—”\n“At least my stupidity didn’t get anyone killed.” Now Jurand looked up\nagain, and so bitterly Leo had to take that awkward step back. “Remember\nwhen there were seven of us?”\nLeo was left frozen, his mouth slightly open. It was a long time since\nhe’d thought of the happy brotherhood who’d gone to war with him. Risked\ntheir lives for him. Most of his energy went into finding ways to do what\nused to be easy, the rest into twisting the future into a shape he could live\nwith.\n“Ritter,” said Jurand, “Barniva, Jin, Antaup, Glaward, me and you.”\nEach name was like a slap. Leo took another wobbling step back, and\nhis stump twisted in the socket of his false leg, and the stab of pain made\nhis knee buckle. His crutch clattered down, but he caught the arm of a chair,\nmanaged to sag into it.\n“They chose to fight,” he whispered.\n“They chose to follow you, and you led them to their deaths.”\n“I miss them,” said Leo. “I miss them like my leg and my arm.” He\nmissed them almost as much as he’d missed Jurand. Now that he thought\nabout them. “But I can’t bring them back… any more than you can take\nback what you did… in Sipani.”\nAnd that familiar image came up, of Jurand and Glaward, pressed\nagainst each other, half-naked on their knees, and Leo winced at the rush of\npainful excitement that always came with it, worse than ever with his old\nfriend right in front of him.\nHe looked even angrier, now. “Who says I want to take it back?” he\nsnarled. “You wouldn’t understand! You’ve never had to hide a thing in\nyour life. You’ve always said and done whatever you pleased. However\nhurtful. However ignorant. You’ve been celebrated for it! How blunt! How\nmanly! Well, it’s a new world now, I hear. We all have to live with things\nwe don’t like.”\n“Oh, there’s been a Great Change, it’s true.” Leo felt his own anger\nbubbling up, never far from the surface, and he slapped at his aching stump.\n“I’m fucked, and the world’s fucked, but there are still some things that—”\nA rattle as the door opened and Savine swept in, smiling radiantly with a"

Thank the Fates you’re here. It’s so\ngood to see you again!”\n“Lady Savine…”\n“Citizeness Savine!” She leaned close, to speak out of the side of her\nmouth. “We are all equal, apparently.” Jurand was staring at the two\nbundles. “Ah, yes. These. This is Harod, and this is Ardee. At least, I think\nthat’s the right way round.” She laughed, just as if there was no icy tension\nin the room at all. “This is your father’s dearest friend, Jurand,” she cooed\nat the babies. “Yes it is, he’s the brains of the business, and everything will\nbe all right now, you’ll see. Two of the little monsters, would you believe\nit?”\n“I… wouldn’t,” said Jurand, still staring.\n“And they’re almost as unreasonable as their father. Shush, shush, come\nnow.” One of them had started to wriggle and squeak. Leo couldn’t be sure,\nbut he wondered if Savine might’ve pinched it. “Could you hold him, just\nfor a moment?” Without waiting for an answer, she dumped the other in\nJurand’s arms.\n“He’s beautiful,” whispered Jurand, and as he stared down at little\nHarod, a hint of that familiar smile touched his face.\n“He takes after his mother in that regard,” murmured Savine.\nAll she’d done was walk in with the children. Put aside the past, those\nlittle bundles of innocent potential seemed to say. Look to the future. As\nsimply as that, the mood was changed.\nLeo had sworn never to let another chance slip by. He dragged himself\nup, set himself as best he could, hesitantly reached out and laid his hand on\nJurand’s shoulder. He didn’t shake it off.\n“I’m sorry,” said Leo. “I’m so sorry.” And he was. For the mistakes he’d\nmade. “I was a fool. I need you.”\n“We need you,” murmured Savine, gripping Jurand’s other shoulder.\n“The Union needs you. Risinau’s position gets weaker and weaker.”\n“No one loves him, no one fears him, no one respects him.”\n“I read a newsbill more savage about him than they used to be about the\nking,” said Leo.\n“One of Sworbreck’s, no doubt,” said Savine. “Even he’s turning on the\nChairman.”\n“Things are coming apart. Riots every day. Someone has to step into the\ngap.”\nJurand glanced at Leo’s hand on his shoulder, then up into his face. “Or\nlimp into it?”\nThe time was Leo might’ve punched him for that, but now he smiled. “I\nwas actually hoping you might carry me into it.”\nJurand looked back to Leo’s son, sound asleep in his arms. “Things will\nhave to be different this time.”\n“Of course,” said Leo.\n“No hotheaded folly.”\n“I’m with you there,” said Savine.\n“And I want something for myself.”\nLeo squeezed Jurand’s shoulder. “You deserve it.”"

A moment later came the echoing rumble of\nanother explosion.\nQuarrels\nS\nhe slapped him as hard as she could. It made her hand sing with pain, so\nshe was pretty sure his face must’ve felt worse.\n“You fucking arsehole!” she screamed.\n“You mad bitch!” he roared back, spraying spit in her face. “That’s it!\nI’m done!” And he kicked the door wide and stomped from the bedchamber\nwhich had once been Bethod’s, once been Scale Ironhand’s, once been\nStour Nightfall’s, and now was Sticky Rikke’s.\nCorleth, who’d been waiting outside, flattened herself against the wall as\nthe Nail stormed past.\n“You’re mad as a bootful o’ bees!” he snarled over his shoulder, trying\nto do his sword-belt up at the same time and making a mess of both.\nRikke’s bare feet slapped at the steps as she chased after him. “Better\nbloody mad than bloody stupid, say I!”\n“No need to pick! You’ve managed the pair!” He stalked out into grey\ndaylight, raindrops prickling the chill puddles scattered about the yard, and\nshe followed.\n“Running away, are you?”\n“Aye,” he growled, “’fore I wring your twig of a neck.”\nFolk all about had perked up at the shouting. A girl with an armload of\nfirewood was gawping at them from under a dripping oilcloth.\n“Back to the West Valleys!” The Nail jerked his arm at his men and they\nfell in with him, tramping in a sullen crowd out of Bethod’s fortress and\ninto the city, dark stone turned darker with wet, dark roofs glistening with\nrain. “You can fight Black Calder on your own.”\n“I’ll do that, and I’ll bloody beat him, too!”\n“You’ll bloody lose and piss away all you took.”\n“My da always said the West Valleys were a fucking sty!” she shrieked\nat his back. “And you don’t need the Long Eye to see they’ve birthed a litter\nof swine wi’ you lot!”\n“Long fucking Eye?” The Nail spun about, looming over her, face so\ntwisted with rage she stumbled back and almost slipped on her arse. “Don’t\nmake me laugh!” And he stuck his great scarred forefinger in her face so\nhard it near went up her nostril. “You can’t see what’s right under your\nnose, you half-blind witch!”\n“Well, at least one of us has something long.” She started forwards and\njabbed her little finger in his face. “Guess we know why they call you the\nNail now!”"

Not one decent set o’ bones in the lot of you! We’re\nwell rid o’ you bloody chicken-fuckers! I never saw such a stack o’ fishy\ncunts! You bloody… bloody…” She’d run out of insults. Even bad ones.\nAnd the Nail and his boys had already made it to the gate of Carleon and\nvanished down the entrance tunnel. She was shouting herself raw at the wet\nair.\nShe realised she’d wandered halfway through the city, bare feet cold on\nthe damp cobbles, bare legs covered in gooseflesh under her cloak, damp\nhair plastered to her head by the chill rain. Reckoned she must have trod in\nsomething on the way, one foot was smeared brown down the side.\n“By the dead,” she muttered, hopping about while she tried to wipe it on\na slippery doorstep. That was when she saw a curious crowd had built up.\nTownsfolk. Carls and Thralls. A couple of dirty children with a big,\nbedraggled dog.\n“Haven’t you shits got aught better to do?” she snapped, pulling that red\ncloth tight about her along with such shreds of dignity as she had left. She\nturned back towards Skarling’s Hall with her chin in the air, doing her best\nto look like a screaming row half-naked in the pissing rain was just one\nmore step in her grand plan.\nCorleth, Isern and Shivers stood in the street behind her, and did not\nlook convinced.\n“I’ve heard it said a clever woman can turn enemies into allies with her\nquim,” mused Isern, eyes thoughtfully narrowed. “Yours seems to work the\nother way around.”\n“Very funny.” Rikke pushed past her and strode back up the hill. “The\nNail had his mind set on going after Calder now. If you can call it a mind.\nBastard wouldn’t be argued down. Now, mark you! With winter coming\non!”\n“I warned her about getting cocky,” muttered Isern from the side of her\nmouth. “Maybe I should’ve warned her about getting cock.”\n“We’ll make do fine without him!” Rikke roared it at the town in\ngeneral. “A fucking carrot can do the same job!”\nShivers raised his one good brow. “Doubt we’ll beat Black Calder with a\ncarrot,” he said.\n“We will not beat him with vegetables of any kind,” said Isern as they\nstepped back through the gate in Bethod’s great wall. “For that we will need\nmen, and my guess is the Nail will be taking his cousins and his uncles and"

But we managed before he turned up, eh, Isern?”\nIsern considered her, jaw muscles squirming as she chewed a chagga\npellet. “When we were running for our lives through a freezing forest,\nd’you mean?”\n“I was thinking of a bit after that.”\n“When we dragged you half-dead and all mad up into the hills to be\npaint-pricked by a witch with her head stitched together?”\n“You’re in one o’ those moods,” snapped Rikke.\n“No,” said Isern. “You are. Sitting in Skarling’s Chair don’t make you\nSkarling, and wearing Savine dan what’s-her-face’s necklace don’t make\nyou Savine dan what’s-her-face.

Head on along this path, you’ll end\nup taking the drop from the windows sooner’n I thought.” She gave a long\nsigh and put her chin in the air. “And all my efforts wasted.”\nRikke stood in the thickening rain, watching her swagger away. She\nbadly wanted to take a parting shot but found the quiver was empty. She\nglanced up at Shivers, who was frowning back at her, his grey hair turned\ndark by the rain.\n“Am I to take it you agree?”\nShivers’ real eye gave away no more than his metal one. “Well, I don’t\ndisagree.”\nRikke hissed in disgust as she ducked back inside, wet feet slapping on\nthe flagstones.\n“Here,” said Corleth, handing her a chagga pellet.\n“Nice to see some folk can yet be relied upon.” And Rikke pushed the\npellet up behind her lip and shoved open the doors to Skarling’s Hall.\nStour was clean now, bruises mostly healed even if his legs never would\nbe. He’d stopped begging. Stopped talking at all. Just sat there, one white\nhand up on the black bars, waiting.

Either it was softening or her arse was hardening, it didn’t\nfeel so uncomfortable as it used to.\n“Ran into a dozen, led by a fellow called Trapper.”\n“Put ’em back in the mud, did you?”\nA brief pause, and Rikke got the feeling he was considering how to cast\nsomething in the best light. He did that a lot. “Some of ’em.”\n“The rest?”\n“Sent ’em back to Black Calder with my cordial greetings and hopes for\na mutually beneficial future.”\n“Kept your options open, in other words.”\nAnd from his cage, she heard Stour Nightfall give the faintest hiss of\ncontempt.\n“Kept the lines o’ communication open, I’d say,” said Clover. “Thought\nthe time might come when that could be useful.”\n“Useful to me, or useful to you?”\n“Our fates are wove together, Chief! I see no difference ’twixt the two.”\n“Huh.” She shifted her chagga pellet from one side of her mouth to the\nother and leaned forwards, turning her left eye towards him. “I’ve seen your\nfuture, Clover.”\nHe winced. “At least tell me I get to sit down.”\n“Not yet, anyway. You’re going to go pay Black Calder a visit.”\nThat wince became a full grimace. “That doesn’t sound like something\nI’d do.”\n“Think better of where you’re at and decide you’d rather be somewhere\nelse? Sounds like the sort of thing you’re famous for.”\n“Knew that’d land me in trouble sooner or later. So if Calder doesn’t kill\nme for betraying him in the first place, what then?”\nRikke considered him a moment. Considered the position. Turned in the\nchair to consider Stour Nightfall, sitting calm in his cage, hungry eyes\ngleaming in the shadows. She weighed the words carefully. “Tell him I’m\nwilling to deal. Peace in the North. In return for his son.”\nClover glanced over at the cage. Rikke heard the chain creak as Stour\nshifted inside, pressing himself to the bars. Heard him make that hiss again.\n“You sure?” asked Clover.\n“I’m sure about asking the question.”\n“As you wish, then.” He dragged his wet cloak from the bench and over\nhis shoulder, slapping dew from the wolf-pelt collar. “If your answer is my\nhead in a jar, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”\n“I’ll weep a river. And Clover?”\n“Aye?”\n“Probably best you don’t mention this business with the Nail. Wouldn’t\nwant Calder thinking we’re weak.”\n“Goes without saying.” And he gave a little bow, and walked out.\nCorleth put one hand on the arm of Skarling’s Chair and leaned down\ntowards her. “Reckon we can trust him?”"

Sometimes you need a man\nno wind can shift.” Rikke turned towards that patch of floor that was getting\nsomewhat stained from her chagga spit and spat on it. “Sometimes you need\none who bends with the breeze.”\nToo Many Principles\n“T\nhis is the Lords’ Round?” asked Glaward, dumbfounded.\n“It was,” said Leo. The place his father had talked of as the cradle of\nnoble ideals. Where the great lords of the Union had engaged in dignified\ndebate. Where Arnault stood alone to challenge Morlic the Mad and\nchanged the course of history. It was easy to forget. “They call it the\nCommons’ Round now.”\nThe stained-glass windows, with their scenes from centuries of the\nUnion’s proud history, had been declared symbols of repression and\nreplaced with free, equal, ideologically sound clear glass from a new\nmanufactory in the Three Farms. Harsh daylight wasn’t kind to the place.\nThe public galleries had been the playground of Adua’s highest society.\nNow, if they hadn’t died or fled the country, the highest society were\nstaying well out of sight. The lowest had crowded into their place, rowdier\nevery day. Sometimes bands would strike up bawdy songs above the\nAssembly, the Union’s government creaking to a halt like a mired cart till\nthey could be clumsily evicted.\nThe days were getting shorter and the endless sessions dragged into the\ndarkness, haggard faces lit by flickering candlelight. The place was chill as\na tomb in the mornings, overhot by lunch, stinking of stale sweat and bad\nbreath and chagga smoke. Representatives ate at their seats, remnants of\nmeals rotting under the greasy benches. Gunnar Broad and his men\nregularly broke up fights. A week before, a drunk had fallen from the upper\ngallery during a scuffle and been smashed to pulp on the floor before the\nHigh Table. They’d paused long enough to scrape the corpse out, then\ncarried on arguing while the mess was being mopped up.\n“We need to be bloody civil!” Ramnard, an old tailor with a face pitted\nby some childhood sickness, was making one of his rude demands for\npoliteness. “I damn well insist that Citizen Sworbreck reduce the number,\nnot to mention the savagery, of his attacks upon members of this Assembly\nin his newsbills and pamphlets—”\nSworbreck leaped up as if he was mounted on a spring. “Nothing would\ndelight me more than to do so! The very instant we reduce the number, not\nto mention the corruption, of the traitors, profiteers and simple\nincompetents in this Assembly!”\nLaughter, applause. The public gallery were as hungry for pain, tears\nand passion as any audience at the theatre. Leo’s clapping days were over,\nbut he slapped the bench beside him one-handed in fake approval.\n“Friends, please!” Risinau whined from his gilded chair. “We still have\nso much work to do on our constitution.

So easily\nroused to anger.” As if he hadn’t ridden a wave of it to power. “Citizen\nSworbreck, we merely ask for a little moderation in the frenzy of your\ndenouncements.”\n“Moderation sells no pamphlets,” muttered Leo.\nSworbreck was well aware of that. “Sully the high principles of this\naugust body with dishonesty? I would rather die!” He tore his shirt open to\nexpose a wedge of pale chest. “Plunge in your dagger there, Citizen! I will\nhappily wash the benches of this Assembly with my heart’s blood in the\ncause of the Great Change, I have said so often!”\n“Washing them with something would be a step forward,” Jurand\nmuttered in Leo’s ear. Sitting between him and Glaward was far from\ncomfortable, given the history. What happened in Sipani. What might still\nbe happening… But it felt better than letting them sit together.\nIn the clamour produced by Sworbreck’s latest offer of martyrdom,\nRepresentatives shouted over each other to be heard. It was noisy as a\nbattle, and Leo watched the back and forth with the care of a general feeling\nout his moment to advance. A white-haired old merchant had kidnapped the\nfloor now, his bass voice so powerful the benches seemed to vibrate.\n“If the attention of the Assembly might be steered to other matters?” Far\ntoo easily, if anything. “I move that Commissioner Pike presents himself to\nexplain his recent actions!”\n“Hear, hear!” blustered that heavyset oaf who used to be one of Savine’s\npartners. Kort, was it? “The Commissioner’s private war against the banks\nis bad for business. We’re losing our advantage to the Styrians! It’s a war\nout there in the markets!”\nA foreman from the Three Farms shook a great fist. He was called,\nappropriately enough, Hefty, though Leo wasn’t sure whether it was a\nnickname or a surname. “There’s a real fucking war going on!” Whoops in\nthe gallery. He turned red in the face. “Begging your pardon.” Laughter in\nthe gallery. He turned redder. “But there’s royalist rebels to worry about in\nthe east!”\n“Treacherous bastards set on raising the king up above us again!”\n“We couldn’t possibly have that,” drawled the king himself, whose\ngilded enclosure had become a wooden one, then a high dais, then a low\ndais, and finally a nursing chair with a rail around it.\nThe usual rage, meanwhile, from above. Crumpled pamphlets were\nflung down. An apple core bounced from the shoulder of an ex-lord a few\nseats away and Jurand flinched.\n“Don’t worry,” said Leo. “They rarely throw anything hard.”\n“What’s the People’s Army doing?” someone howled.\n“I have men, but no leaders.” General Brint frowned from his chair\nbeside Risinau’s. “I beg you, Citizens, allow me to bring in officers from\nthe old King’s Own—”\n“How can we trust men who served the old regime?”\n“Who else were they supposed to serve?

Brint was a good enough man, but he didn’t understand the\nrules of this engagement.\n“Is it like this all the time?” murmured Glaward.\n“Most of it.”\n“How do they get anything done?”\n“They don’t.” Leo sensed the slightest lull in the melee, and he settled\nhis stump in the socket of his iron leg, his crutch in his aching armpit.\n“Could you help me up?”\n“The Young Lion!” someone screeched as Glaward guided him to\nstanding, and the hall fell silent. As close as it ever got, anyway.\n“Citizens!” Leo limped a few steps onto the tiled floor so that he stood\nalone. “Friends! Good men and women of the Union!” He aimed that at the\npublic galleries and got a reassuring murmur of support. He’d found if he\ncould bring the scum up there onto his side, the scum down here wouldn’t\ndare disagree. “We can’t afford to bicker! We’ve got enemies everywhere,\nkeen to divide us!”\nLeo was careful not to name the enemies, of course. He let everyone fill\nin their own.\n“Bastard Styrians!” someone snarled.\n“Bloody Southerners!”\n“Aristocrats!”\n“We’ve won a great victory against tyranny,” he called. “We’ve won the\nchance to forge a Union that’s the envy of the world.” And he set himself so\nhe could strike his crutch on the tiles with an echoing bang. “But we have to\nbuild bridges. We have to bring good men in. Like my old friends from\nAngland. Discord won’t help us. We need equality. We need loyalty. We\nneed unity!”\nHe hobbled to his seat with the applause ringing in his ears and dropped\ndown wincing, shaking his leg to loosen it on his sore stump.\nGlaward looked more dumbfounded than ever. “You didn’t… say\nanything.” Perhaps he was faithful and diligent, like Savine said, but Leo\nhad forgotten how slow he could be.\n“Only an idiot stands in front of this rabble to say something,” muttered\nLeo, wiping the fresh sheen of sweat from his forehead. “You shuffle a few\nof the right words together and make sure you look ’em in the eye.” He\nflashed the humble smile he’d been working on. Waved away the\ncongratulations as men leaned from the benches behind to slap him on the\nshoulder. “You’re going for a feeling. Make them think you’re one of them.\nProve the mob’s behind you.

A happy hint of the way he used to look\nat Leo before… all this. “I thought you were a blunt soldier?”\n“I’m still a soldier.” Leo shifted his useless arm in his jacket and saluted\nthe gallery. “It’s just a different battlefield.”\n“When did that fucker get eloquent?” grumbled Orso, slumping into his\nridiculous little chair. He had half a mind to applaud himself. “Equality? He\nmust be the most privileged bastard in here.”\n“Other than you,” murmured Hildi.\n“Other than me, yes, thanks for that, Hildi. His family’s had a seat in this\nbloody chamber for centuries. His grandfather was almost elected king\nhimself and betrayed the Union when he lost the vote. Like grandfather like\ngrandson, eh?”\n“You can’t deny folk warm to him, though.”\n“Oh, yes. People have always loved the Young Lion.” He still seemed to\nbe the same honest Anglander, none of Sworbreck’s flowery style, but these\ndays he was playing the mob like his own personal orchestra and leading\nthe nervous ex-lords wherever he pleased. Now he had a dozen virile young\nheroes of Angland on the front benches ready to nod along at his every\nutterance as though it fell from the mouth of Euz himself. Orso was starting\nto think he was far more dangerous now than he had been with all his limbs.\n“An appeal for loyalty, can you imagine? A few months ago he was\nleading his own rebellion!”\nThe hypocrisy was breathtaking. But the public appetite for hypocrisy\nappeared insatiable. Isher, who not long ago had enriched himself beyond\nthe dreams of avarice by evicting impoverished tenants from common land,\nhad risen to preach thrift in the most conspicuously humble, dirt-coloured\nclothes one could imagine.\n“Citizens, please!” Risinau was struggling vainly, as he had been for\nweeks, to impose order on this shambles. “Our constitution!”\nAnd Orso started to laugh. A little snigger at first. He tried to hold it in,\nbut it burst out again. An explosive giggle. Every face he noticed made it\nworse. The monstrously wealthy traitor Isher, hiding in an honest man’s\nfeast-day clothes. The turncoat loser Brock, cheered to the rafters for his\npatriotism and prowess. The cowardly fantasist Sworbreck, posing as the\ncommon man’s fearless champion. The onslaught of overblown preaching,\nsentimental one-upmanship, angry stands on shifting principles, tearful\ndeclarations of shifting loyalty. The worst of mankind jammed into the\nsockets where the best should have been. A crown of turds.\n“You all right?” muttered Hildi, looking worried.\nOrso was shuddering with mirth now, laughter echoing about the\nchamber. No one else looked amused. The Chairman especially.\n“Perhaps His Majesty might explain what he finds so amusing?”\n“What don’t I?” Orso’s eyes swam with tears. “Your grand experiment?\nYour wondrous new system?

Believe me, no one liked the old way of doing\nthings less than I, but my forebears ran the Union for six centuries. You’ll\nbe lucky if you make it six months.”\n“Captain Broad! We cannot have this cavalier disrespect for our\nAssembly!”\nBroad wearily nudged his lenses up his nose and began to trudge\ntowards the royal enclosure.\nOrso jumped up. “Are we not all equal here?” He addressed the public\ngallery in a wailing mockery of Sworbreck’s overwrought delivery. “Does\nnot every Citizen deserve an equal chance to speak? Even so base a creature\nas a king?”\n“Let him talk!” someone shouted.\n“Let him talk himself into a noose!”\n“I begin to wish you’d follow through on your threats!” called Orso.\nBravery had descended inexplicably upon him, as it had at Stoffenbeck.\nBravery born of fear, boredom, frustration and at least a little drunkenness.\nFar from heroic ingredients, to be sure, but no one asks what went into the\npie so long as the results taste well. “You’ve hanged a good many decent\npeople already! I’d rather join them than suffer this chorus of flatterers,\nthugs and hypocrites.”\n“How dare you?” But Risinau’s voice was more plaintive whine than\noutraged roar. “We are shaping the future!”\nOrso almost sympathised. “Take it from a man who’s been there, you’re\nthe figurehead on a ship of fools. I daresay there are good people here, and\ngood intentions. You had a chance to make things better and, believe it or\nnot, no one looked forward to seeing it more than I did. But you haven’t\nachieved a damn thing. I know this is rich coming from me, but… you’re\nsimply poor quality. You’re a worthless bag of bluster. A spent match.”\n“Never thought I’d agree with His fucking Majesty.”\nThere was a rustling as the Representatives turned to stare towards the\ntop of the aisle. One could make many criticisms of Judge, but never that\nshe didn’t make an entrance. She came stalking down the steps between the\nbenches with all the swagger of a champion to the fencing circle, her stolen\nchains scraping her breastplate, her red hair greased into a flaming crest, the\nflinty point to a spearhead of grim-faced, hard-handed, red-clothed men.\nHer black eyes swept the benches with the kind of burning purpose the\nAssembly had been sorely lacking, but Orso felt far from relieved as her\ngaze fell upon him.\n“Sit down, Citizen Orso,” she said.\nOrso sat.\nJudge stopped before the High Table, hands on hips and her bare feet\nplanted wide. “I have watched the fucking pantomime in this ill-behaved\nnursery with growing disgust,” she said.\n“Aye!” growled the Burners, in echoing unison.\n“You were meant to put things right, but all you’ve done is spill a sea of\ntalk.

A skull grin that got nowhere near her eyes. “Oh, I’m\nhere to arrest the perpetrators.”\nOne of the secretaries set down her pen to hurry around the High Table,\none ink-stained finger wagging. “With respect, you have no warrant here—”\n“You sure? Brother Sarlby, could you produce our credentials?”\n“With pleasure.” A rat-faced Burner with a red-spattered cap stepped\nforward, sliding his hand into his jacket pocket. He brought it out in front of\nthe secretary. There was nothing there but his fist. He smashed it into her\nface and knocked her down, her head bouncing on the tiles. She was left\ngazing up in amazement with blood running from her broken nose.\nThere was a stunned silence in the Commons’ Round. Orso had the\nsense that, in that moment, all the rules had changed. Again.\nThen Judge burst out laughing. “You fools have got as coddled as His\nMajesty used to be. As useless as the Open Council used to be. What is it\nabout some folk, that power makes ’em weak?”\nRisinau had turned very pale. “I am still Chairman of this Assembly!”\nHe gripped the gilded arms of his chair as though to prove it to himself, but\nthe echoes of his voice had become scared squeaks in the high space of the\ndome above. “Captain Broad! See this woman removed forthwith!”\nBroad frowned towards the doors. He’d been doing it ever since Judge\nstrutted in. She hadn’t been the last person through. Dozens of folk wearing\nred had slipped into the chamber. Red caps, red sleeves, red rags tied\naround their heads. Some with their hands behind their backs, or hidden by\ntheir sides, or wedged in their jackets. One grinning little girl carried a great\ndripping pot of paint, scattering red dots across the dirty marble.\nBurners.\nThere were splashes of red everywhere. Broad lifted his head so he\ncould peer through his lenses and saw red flatbows at the rail of the public\ngallery.\n“Captain Broad?” Brint had an odd tone, suddenly. Less of an order than\na wheedle.\n“No, no, no,” purred Judge, the ragged train of her dress hissing across\nthe dirty tiles towards Broad, those black eyes fixed on him all the way, and\nshe reached up, and touched his face with her fingertips. The gentlest touch,\njust under his ear, sliding down his jaw till she held his chin, and it made his\nflesh crawl and his heart pound both at once.\nHe could’ve shoved her away.

Helpless as he’d\nbeen tied to a chair in a Valbeck cellar with her sitting astride him. “Captain\nBroad and I understand each other,” she said, softly.\nAnd she was right, Fates help him. Judge was trouble made flesh. The\nmonster off the leash. She was madness, and fire, and violence, and all the\nthings he’d told himself he didn’t want.\nBut here’s the sorry truth—if you really don’t want a thing, you don’t\nhave to keep telling yourself so.\nThe little girl held up the paint pot and Judge stuck her hand into it.\nDrops spattered the tiles as she smeared four streaks across Broad’s\nbreastplate with her red fingers. “You’re one of us now.” She went up on\nher tiptoes to whisper, “But we know you always were.”\nNo one did a thing as the Burners brought out chains and started to\nshackle the men and women gathered around Risinau. Not the king, sitting\nmeekly on his little chair. Not the Young Lion, watching warily from among\nhis Anglanders. Not the artists and the thinkers Risinau had brought to the\nAssembly. Even the rowdies in the public galleries had swallowed their\ntongues.\nAnd Broad was quietest of the lot. He knew a lost cause when he saw\none.\n“You can’t do this!” Risinau clung to his chair as Sarlby caught him\nunder the arm, dragging it squealing over the tiles. “I will go to the Weaver\n—”\nJudge’s red-rimmed eyes slid sideways to him. “Who d’you think gave\nme the keys to the chamber, you fat fool?”\nRisinau gaped at her as he was finally bundled from his chair and Sarlby\nsnapped manacles shut around his wrists. “But… we need a new\nconstitution—”\n“What we need is purpose,” sneered Judge. “What we need is purity.\nWhat we need is a fresh start.”\n“Shall we hang ’em?” asked Sarlby.\n“Hang ’em? No. Wouldn’t send at all the right message.” Judge dropped\ninto Risinau’s chair and swept some of his papers off onto the floor to clear\na space. “The bright future’s come at last.” And she propped one bare foot\nup on the polished table and crossed the other one on top of it, their soles\ngrey with dirt. “Don’t want to usher it in with a hanging, do we?” Broad\ntook a sharp breath. Only realised then that he’d been holding it the whole\ntime. Mercy was the last thing he’d expected from Judge.\n“We need to kill these bastards with more guts,” she said. “We need\nsomething spectacular. Anyone got any ideas?”\nNot mercy, then. Its very opposite. There was a brittle silence. The\nRepresentatives glanced at each other, at Risinau and his underlings being\nchained, at all the well-armed Burners, no one wanting to stand out from the\ncrowd.\nThen Ramnard cleared his throat. “I suppose… there’s always\nbeheading?”\nAnd now those very same bastards who’d competed for Risinau’s notice"

Something\nthat will serve as lesson and deterrent. Something representative of the\ncrime.”\nJudge narrowed her eyes at him. “Yes.”\n“Might I suggest that those who have fallen short of the principles of the\nGreat Change… should themselves fall! In full view of the Citizens they\nhave failed. From the top of the Tower of Chains, perhaps?”\nA murmur ran around the hall. Fear? Awe? Excitement? All three mixed\nup? “By the Fates,” whispered Brint. A Burner had closed a cuff on the one\nwrist the general had but was scratching his head over what to do with the\nother one.\n“Huh.” Judge tipped her head back so she could gaze up towards the\ngilded dome, scratching gently at her rashy neck with the backs of her\nbroken fingernails. Slowly, the smile spread across her face. “My thanks,\nCitizen Sworbreck, and the nation’s thanks.” She jerked her head towards\nthe door. “Take ’em up the Tower of Chains. And push ’em off.”\nOne of the arrested gave a little whimper. Another sagged against the\nHigh Table.\n“No trial?” It was the king, and he wasn’t laughing now. His throat\nshifted as he nervously swallowed.\nJudge grinned back at him. “The trial can be on the way down. The\nground can give the verdict. You go with ’em, Broad. Make sure they all\ntake the drop. Sarlby?”\n“Judge?”\n“Make sure he makes sure.”\nBroad nudged his lenses down to rub at the sore bridge of his nose, then\nnudged them back into place and started rolling up his sleeves.

They organised the dozen prisoners who’d been\nbehind the table into a line, Brint near the front, Risinau near the back,\nBurners around ’em with weapons drawn. Then they shuffled across the\ntiled floor to the aisle, and up it, between the silent benches. Everyone\nwatched. No one spoke.\n“First things first,” Judge was saying as Broad trudged dumbly from the\nRound behind the prisoners. “This ain’t so much an Assembly now as a\ncourtroom.

Across the Square of\nMarshals, Square of Equality, Square of Murder, whatever they were calling\nit now, curious eyes following them all the way. He narrowed his own eyes\nas a chilly gust swept up, brown leaves chasing each other across the\nflagstones.\n“You cannot do this!” gurgled Risinau. “You cannot do this!”\n“Shut up, fat man,” said Sarlby.\n“I will see you all punished—”\nSarlby slapped him, and again, and again. Slapped him till his face was\npink. “Understand yet?”\nRisinau blew a bloody bubble from his nose, breath coming fast and his\neyes a little crossed. “Yes,” he squeaked.\nBroad stepped through an archway and the Tower of Chains reared up\nahead, slim as a lady’s finger, white stone streaked with sooty dirt. He’d\nheard it toppled the day Bayaz destroyed the Eaters, and he’d had it rebuilt\neven taller.\nA woman near the front must’ve fainted when she saw it, suddenly\ncollapsed, skirt billowing. Broad picked her up under the arm. Not rough,\nbut firm. They could do this without being disrespectful. Guided her back\ninto the queue.\nCloser came the tower, and closer. It was like he stood outside himself.\nCouldn’t change a thing. If he didn’t do this, someone else would, and he’d\ntake the drop with the rest and never go home to Liddy and May.\n“Captain Broad,” hissed Brint, from the side of his mouth. “You have to\nstop this now. You have a chance to stop this.” Broad didn’t speak. Wasn’t\nsure he could speak.\nOne of the prisoners was crying. Another tried desperately to wedge\nhimself in the doorway to the tower, pressing his face to the stone. “No!\nNo! No—”\nA Burner clubbed him across the skull and he fell senseless, blood from\nhis cut head pattering across the threshold.\n“Oh, that’s just brilliant,” said Sarlby, hands on hips.\nThe man looked a bit put out. “I couldn’t just leave him there, could I?”\n“Give him a kick, then! Now we’ll have to carry the bastard. Or you\nwill, anyway.”\n“Fuck,” said the man, bending down to heave him over one shoulder.\nOnto an endless stair of neatly cut stone, shoving the prisoners ahead.\nEchoing of footsteps. Echoing of breath, of cries, of whimpers, of words.\nThe tone changed the higher they got. Bluster, at the bottom.\n“How dare you!”\n“I have friends, you know!”\n“You’ll pay for this!”\nA glimpse of the rooftops outside the Agriont, through a narrow window.\nThen came the bartering.\n“I can give you a thousand marks. Two thousand!”\n“Only let me reach my pocket!”\n“I have friends, rich friends!”\nScrape, scrape, scrape of boots on stone. Then came the begging.\n“Please!”\n“I have three children!

No one’s more loyal to the Great Change\nthan I am!”\n“Please!”\nAll wasted breath. All herded on up the endless stairs.\n“Be strong,” someone was whispering, “be strong.” Broad didn’t know\nif they were talking to themselves or someone else. What difference could\nbeing strong make? Strong or weak, the fall was still the fall.\nHow many steps? Hundreds, it felt like. Risinau’s wheezing getting\nworse and worse behind him. Not a man built for steps.\n“Get up there, you fat bastard.”\n“Can’t we just roll him out here?”\n“Ain’t a window big enough.” Laughter.\nBroad kept climbing. His legs burned. The breath cut at his chest. But he\nhardly felt it. Someone else’s legs. Someone else’s breath.\nOut from the darkness and onto the roof and he blinked at a clear, crisp\nday. Adua spread out below them, the chimneys jutting, plumes of smoke\ncarried off by the chill wind, tiny ships at tiny wharves in the bay. Toy\npeople swarming in a toy city.\n“Damn, that’s high!” Sarlby took his red cap off to wipe his forehead,\nthin hair whipping around a smile full of yellow teeth. He’d found an empty\ncrate somewhere, and he dragged it up next to the parapet. A little step to\nstand on.\nThe prisoners were dragged from the stair, breathing hard from the\nclimb, whooping sobs, puffs of smoke on the chill air. The Burners watched\nin their red hats and their red sashes and their clothes dashed and spattered\nwith red paint, their weapons drawn and their eyes bright and righteous.\nBroad noticed a bird perched on the roof of the little turret above the\nstairwell. Watching the whole business, unblinking.\n“Right, then.”\nSarlby and one of the other Burners took the nearest prisoner under the\narms and marched him across the rooftop. Tall fellow, he was, with a\nbirthmark under his ear. He went meekly enough, till he got to the box, then\nhe snarled and twisted, his shoes scraping on the stones.\n“Help us out, Bull!”\nBroad caught a fistful of the man’s jacket from behind, kicked his foot\naway and helped shove him up onto the box. He stood there, breathing hard,\nstaring down in disbelief at the city below, feet level with the embrasure in\nfront of him.\nBroad saw the lump on his neck bob as he swallowed. “Tell my wife that\nI— Oh!”\nSarlby shoved him off. He turned in the air, surprised. Then he was\ngone. Broad felt like he should flinch, look away, cover his face with his\nhands. But he just watched. Sweat from the climb tickled under his red-\ndaubed breastplate. He scratched at his sticky armpit.\nSarlby peered eagerly over the battlements, like a boy who’d tossed\nsomething off a bridge into a river and was waiting for it to show up on the\nother side.\nThere was a sharp smack far below. Like a whip-crack. Sarlby"

Sarlby\nstraightened up, puffing out his cheeks. “Well, that’s the end o’ that, eh?”\nSarlby had been a good man. In Styria, and in Valbeck. One of the better\nones. Better than Broad had been. A good man. What kind of good was this,\nthough? What would Liddy have said to it? What would May? Broad felt\nlike he should be crying. Should be screaming. But all he did was check his\nsleeves were rolled right, then guide another one over from the stairs. A\nclerk, he thought, used to sit at the far end of the table with a ledger. The\nman had rolled his eyes at Broad when Risinau was spouting off one time,\nand Broad had stopped himself smiling. Across the roof he went now,\ntowards the box, stumbled on the way, but one of the Burners caught him\nbefore he fell, helped him back up. Wouldn’t want him falling before time.\n“Sorry,” he muttered, trying to get his foot up on the box but it was\ntrembling so bad he couldn’t manage it. “So sorry.”\n“Here you go.” Sarlby gave him a shove and he tumbled straight over,\nthen beckoned for the next one.\n“I’m just a sculptor! I’m just a sculptor!” She was saying it over and\nover, in a Styrian accent, which wasn’t helping. No one liked a foreigner\nany more. “I’m just a sculptor!” Like a prayer. Higher and higher, faster and\nfaster, more and more desperate. “I’m just a sculptor!” She’d pissed herself.\nA trail of spatters across the roof, hem of her dress dragging through it.\n“I’m just a sculptor!”\n“You’re a sculptor found guilty o’ treason,” said Sarlby, and he pricked\nher up onto the box with the point of his knife.\n“No! I am only here to help carve new statues! I’m just a—”\nAnd over she went. It was the way he didn’t even let ’em finish a\nsentence. Like nothing they could say would matter. Like they were rubbish\ntossed in a ditch. And those behind just stared. Like it was nothing to do\nwith them. Even as they were herded closer to the parapet. Even as Broad\nhelped.\nBrint was next. They never had found anything to put that other cuff\naround, on account of his one arm, so when one of the Burners caught hold\nof him he shook the man off, waved the others away, walked without a\nword towards the box. He took a breath, stepped up himself, and stepped off\nhimself, and made no sound on the way down.\nBroad blinked. Brint had been a good man. He was reasonably sure of\nthat. He’d tried to do the right thing, when everything fell apart. But good\nor bad, right or wrong, the fall is still the fall.\nSome went off flailing, like they were trying to find something to catch\nhold of. Some dropped, limp. Some made no sound.

You could hear them whooping and cheering\nand gasping down there in the city, beyond the dry moat. You didn’t see a\nthing like this every day.\nBroad looked at the smear of red paint across his breastplate. Had he\nbeen forced to do this? Had he chosen to do it? Had he wanted to do it? Was\nhe one of them, like Judge said? Had he always been? He took off his\nlenses, rubbed his eyes.\n“You all right, Bull?” asked Sarlby.\nBroad swallowed as he hooked his lenses back on, nudged them into that\ngroove where they belonged. Helped to have a routine. “Aye,” he lied.\n“Fine.”\nRisinau looked near dead already from the climb. Face pale and beaded\nwith sweat and tears, mouth hanging open, gasping for breath. “I wish…\nto say—”\n“You’ve fucking said enough,” said Sarlby, and jabbed his knife into the\nChairman’s arse, herding him up onto the box.\nVick watched another little speck fall from the Tower of Chains.

The faint scream, carried on the wind,\nsuddenly cut off. Felt like the last shreds of hope for Sibalt’s better world\nwere cut off with it.\nVick had borne witness to some horrors in her life. In the camps. In the\nmines. In the rebellion in Starikland, the uprising in Valbeck, the battle at\nStoffenbeck. But she’d never seen anything like this.\n“What have you done?” she whispered.\nPike raised one hairless brow at her. “What have we done, you mean? It\nwas you who told me Risinau had to go.

Now she wondered whether there were any\nunderneath. “Sometimes, to change the world, we must first burn it down.”\nAnother little speck tumbled from the top of the Tower of Chains.\nBeyond the ruined walls of the Agriont, the crowd applauded.\nPART VIII\n“In crowds it is stupidity and not mother wit that is accumulated.”"

Somewhat delayed, I regret to say, by…\nevents.”\nCurnsbick, understated in a rough-spun waistcoat with a flavour of\nworkman’s apron, held up his broad hands for silence, though more from\nhabit than necessity. The members used to raise the roof. Now they sat in\nanxious silence.\n“With thanks to our distinguished patron, Citizeness Brock.” Curnsbick\ngestured in the vague direction of the box where Savine sat. She forced an\nawkward smile and eased deeper into the shadows. She had spent half her\nlife trying to stand out from the crowd, but only fools made themselves\nconspicuous these days.\n“I come before you full of optimism!” called Curnsbick, with the sweaty\ndemeanour of a pedlar who would never buy what he was being forced to\nsell. “The Great Change offers us brave new opportunities! Workers flock to\nthe cities.” Or were driven there by cold, hunger and war to freeze on the\nroads or starve in the doorways. “Regulations are relaxed.” Because no one\nknew who was in charge or whether anything would be enforced. “Land\nlong occupied becomes available.” Chiefly through the mechanism of\nuncontrolled fire.\nHe neglected to mention the worsening shortages of food, coal and raw\nmaterials, the dangers of riot and summary arrest, or the never-ending trials\nfor profiteering, speculation and usury. The many empty seats in the\naudience testified to them more eloquently than even the Great Machinist\never could.\n“Our friends in Starikland, Angland and Westport are… a little wary.”\nOn the verge of declaring their secession from the Union, indeed.\n“Traditional markets may, for now, have been closed off. But a world of\npossibilities opens up for the enterprising innovator!” Those not rendered\ninto pulp at the foot of the Tower of Chains. “There is a grand harvest to be\nreaped, not merely material but, far more importantly, moral, social and\ncultural.” If one could overlook the Burners’ slogans daubed on every mill\nand manufactory. “With liberty and equality added to our traditional virtues\nof imagination and endeavour, the Great Change will surely bring\nprosperity to all its children!” Those it did not eat alive. Curnsbick spread\nhis arms wide as he built to a crescendo of insincerity. “No man can stop,\nnor would any man want to stop, progress!”\nNobody dared stand out by being first to clap, and so an agonising\nsilence stretched, huge and heavy.\nIt struck Savine as profoundly strange that, out in the foyer, beneath the\ntwo great chandeliers and the broken plaster where the third had once hung,\nno one was screaming. No one wept, vomited or tore at their faces with\ntheir fingernails. Life simply went on. The knots of conversation, the babble\nof business, the offers, the promises, the investments of a lifetime."

Cheeks were painted slapped-arse pink while\nfans had become a loathed aristocratic affectation. Some women had\nstopped wearing wigs altogether, proudly displaying their conspicuously\nlifeless actual hair as if it was a badge of revolutionary pride. Exotic curios\nhad been all the rage; now anything foreign was scorned with a patriotic\nside-eye. Jewels had plunged in popularity, but fortunes were spent on dried\nflowers and woven grasses. It was a wonder no one had brought a herd of\ngoats as an accessory. Nurturing bosoms were thrust up so high they\npresented a danger of suffocation to bystanders. The Great Change had\nbrought freedom to all, of course, but the corsetry of the Citizeness was, if\nanything, even more constricting than that endured by a lady of King Jezal’s\nreign.\n“Equality never quite comes in equal shares,” murmured Savine.\n“I am from Gurkhul,” said Zuri, checking the watch. “I am well aware.”\n“Nothing sells but coupling and pratfalls,” the theatre’s owner was\nlamenting to an acquaintance in a quavering bass. “Once great Juvens’\nexhortation to the senators echoed from the rafters! Now we watch a fat\nman trip over the night pot and pretty people pretend to fuck.”\n“Can we not admit that fucking has always been popular?”\n“I suppose. These days I hardly know whether I’m hiring actors or\nwhores.”\n“There’s a difference?” Followed by stutters of forced laughter.\nThey all were skaters on thin ice, their smiles stretched tight over their\nterror, gliding on as the cracks shot out beneath them. People startled at\nevery noise in the street, expecting Burners to burst into the theatre and\ndrag away the membership of the Solar Society wholesale. The workmen of\nAdua had lived in constant fear of the people in this room. Now it was their\nturn. But life went on, even as the world simultaneously froze and burned\naround them. What was the alternative?\n“Credit!” a man with immense side-whiskers frothed. “There’s no\nbloody credit anywhere. All the banks are shuttered!”\n“Most of the bankers are in the House of Truth. Sorry, House of Purity.\nThe ones who haven’t taken the long drop yet, anyway. Usury. Is that even\na crime?”\n“If it is, aren’t we all guilty?”\n“If Pike wanted to strangle business he’s gone about it the right way…”\nSavine had once felt nowhere more at home than here, flitting from one"

        "text": "a crime?”\n“If it is, aren’t we all guilty?”\n“If Pike wanted to strangle business he’s gone about it the right way…”\nSavine had once felt nowhere more at home than here, flitting from one\nopportunity to another, hopes and dreams left wrecked in her wake. Now all\nshe wanted was to slit the laces of her corset and sag down with her\nchildren, slap the stopper from the decanter and never put it back.\n“By the Fates,” she muttered. “I have become my mother.”\n“There are worse things one could become,” said Zuri.\nIt had all been so much more fun with a ready supply of pearl dust and\nno ever-present threat of death. But there was no pearl dust to be had, and\nlife had never been cheaper.\n“I hear old Marnavent took the long drop,” someone brayed carelessly.\n“So who’s running things at the patent office now?”\n“You assume there is still a patent office. Last I heard they were keeping\npigs in the place.”\n“Count yourself lucky if it’s just your ideas that are stolen. Yoslund lost\nevery stick of furniture in the uprising. They made off with his damn\ndoors!”\n“At least during King Jezal’s reign one knew who to bloody bribe…”\n“Citizeness Savine!”\n“Citizeness Selest.”\nIf simplicity was the fashion, Selest Heugen bucked the trend. Her look\nwas bread-rioting grand duchess. Militant millionaire with a dash of top-end\nprostitute. Dark rubies spilled down her neck like blood from a slit throat\nand her black dress was artfully slashed to show Burner’s scarlet. Most\nwomen had stopped wearing swords. Having Leo’s wounds in her face had\nentirely killed Savine’s appetite for tools of death. Selest had gone the other\nway, with a genuine horseman’s axe dangling from her crimson sash.\n“You look… wonderful.” Savine had been aiming at earnest, but had not\nthe history to pull it off, and Selest’s bosom heaved with offence. Probably\nthere was nothing Savine could have said that would not have caused\noffence, and certainly nothing that would have stopped that bosom heaving.\nSelest gave Savine a sneering look up and down. “You look…\nmotherly.”\nThat would once have been an insult punishable by a slow social death,\nmeticulously engineered. Now it hardly drew a shrug.\n“After the year I’ve had…” The aftermath of Valbeck, her marriage to\nLeo, their treason against the king, the mass violence of the battle at\nStoffenbeck, the almost-hanging of her husband, the even greater violence\nof the Great Change, the birth of her children, the coming of Judge and the\nwhole world slowly, painfully ripping apart. Savine realised she had put a\nhand to the well-powdered scar on her forehead and forced it back down.\n“I’m only surprised I look alive.”\n“I spend much of my time at the Court of the People these days. You\nreally should see your husband address the Representatives. He still makes\nthe ladies gasp, up in the balcony. Quite the man. Even if he is half a man\nnow.”\nSavine smiled. “As tired as I am, half is more than I can manage.”"

And you used to have such an appetite.” Selest spun away, that\nridiculous axe bouncing against her leg.\n“Haven’t you heard?” Savine muttered wearily at her back. “Everything\nis changed.”\n“Citizeness Brock!” A young man she did not know, with cheap clothes\nand the light of ambition in his eyes. “Would you have a moment to hear\nabout a new type of mirror? Tougher, clearer, cheaper. We’ll put those swine\nin Visserine out of business—”\n“I fear you must do it without me.” She used to swoop on every hint of\nopportunity, hawk-eyed, eagle-taloned, every mark clawed up a point\ntriumphantly scored against the world. Now the thought of profits made her\nsick. With a little guilt, when she thought of the bread queues, the homeless\nin the doorways, the dead in the frozen graveyards. With a lot of fear, when\nshe thought of them rendered into accusations in the Court of the People,\nscreamed from the benches, flung down from the public galleries.\nIt was coming. She knew it was coming. They all would have their\nmoment in the dock. She pressed a smile down on top of her dread like the\nlid on a box of snakes.\n“But, Citizeness—”\n“I wish you every success, but I am not seeking to make money. I am\nlooking for opportunities to give it away.”\nA flicker of incomprehension, and the man drifted on.\n“All that effort to acquire it.” Curnsbick stood, shaking his head. “And\nnow you’re simply giving it away. Do you really suppose charity will help,\nSavine?”\n“We can hope,” she said, pressing his hand.\n“We can.” He had lost weight. He looked a shadow of himself. “But,\ngiven where we are, it might be better if we didn’t.”\n“It was a very… carefully judged address this year.”\n“It was all shit. But what should I say? The truth? I’m no keener on\nclimbing the Tower of Chains than anyone else. Though no one will need to\nclimb soon.” He dabbed at his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief. “I’ve\nbeen commissioned to install a hoist.”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“The Burners can’t march the prisoners up the stairway fast enough.\nThey cry, they faint, they beg for mercy. Judge wants me to build a steam-\npowered platform that can haul two dozen at a time.”\nSavine’s skin prickled under her dress. “Oh.” What else could be said to\nthat?\n“When I was a boy,” muttered Curnsbick, “patriotism was kissing the\nflag and pretending to love the king. Now, suddenly, it’s spitting on the king\nand having poor furniture. One must keep a close eye on the current\ndefinitions. To be unpatriotic would be terrible.

I feel I can admit to you, as an old friend, that since the\nGreat Change… I am constantly terrified.” He gave a little laugh, but she\ncould see tears on his cheeks. He removed his lenses and wiped them on the\nback of his sleeve.\nSavine put a gentle hand on his arm. “I hardly think you are alone in\nthat.”\n“I freely admit that I have never been a brave man. Once, out in the Far\nCountry, I met a fellow called Lamb, who had travelled hundreds of miles,\nfacing down Ghosts and mercenaries and Dragon People and every danger\nsearching for his children. Whatever the odds, he simply… would not be\ncowed. I think about him often. I wish I was more like him, but every day\nout there, I was scared. I am—”\n“You are an inventor.” She took his hot, limp, sticky hand between hers.\n“You have done more good in the world than a thousand warriors. Show me\nsomeone who denies it and I’ll spit in their eye.”\nHe gave a brittle smile. “I believe you would.”\n“Citizeness Brock.” The speaker had curly hair and was unremarkable\napart from his different-coloured eyes. “I was hoping I might see you here.”\n“Citizen Sulfur… is that the right term of address for a magus?”\n“I hardly know the right terms for anything these days. Even if I did, I\nfear they would be the wrong ones by tomorrow morning.”\n“What brings you back to the Solar Society?”\n“I have a great deal of money to invest, in fact.”\n“Then you will not be short of friends here. Commissioner Pike’s\ntireless crusade against the banks has made investment hard to come by.”\n“I understand you are providing bread and coal to the poor. Perhaps we\nmight do some good together? Would you consider accepting a loan…?”\nSavine felt a coldness on the back of her neck. She remembered her\nfather’s words. About magi. About Bayaz. About Valint and Balk. She made\nsure she kept smiling, but she made sure she was firm. “I am afraid I cannot\nhelp you.”\n“Ah, what a shame. I remember the last time we met, on the docks of\nOstenhorm, before your rebellion against the Crown. You could not help me\nthen, either. That proved a rather notable mistake.”\nHolding on to her smile took some effort. “Far from the only one I have\nmade. Even so. You understand a woman must not put herself in too much\ndebt.”\n“She must take care over the partners she chooses.”\n“Precisely.”\n“But even more over those she turns down.” The softer he talked, the\nmore worried she became. “A woman with secrets, especially.”\nShe wished she had a fan now, so she could brush him off with it. “We\nall have secrets, Master Sulfur.”\n“We are not all bastard offspring of a king.”\nHer smile crumpled. Time seemed to slow. She felt cold and burning hot\nat once. The foyer was an overbright whirl of faces. Keen ears.

The boy, or the—”\n“I’ll fucking kill you!” she snarled in his face, catching his jacket in her\ntrembling fist. “Threaten my children? I’ll see you dead!”\nHe looked far less surprised than she was. And only for a moment. Then\nhe let his head drop on one side. “You really would have been my master’s\nfirst choice. But in my experience, and yours, too, I daresay, one never has\nto go far to find someone who will take your money. Or your secrets.\nCitizeness Heugen!” He brushed off her limp hand and stepped away into\nthe crowd. “A moment of your time!”\nSavine saw Selest’s eyes dart over, as keen for any trace of opportunity\nas her own had once been. She tried to smile, but the muscles in her face\nwould not work the way they used to. She could not see Zuri. The blood\nwas pulsing behind her eyes.\nHer instinct was to run. To the docks. Then Angland. Styria. Distant\nThond, for that matter. But she knew she was watched. She would not get\nfar with two babies. And to run would be to admit her guilt. Of what, she\nhardly knew.\nThey would think of something.\nConspiracies\n“A\nconspiracy typical of those that riddle Adua!” thundered Sworbreck.\n“Just as maggots will riddle a harvest if left unchecked!”\nOrso did not doubt it was typical. In that it was a total fantasy.\nSworbreck stalked past the dock, pointing out the accused one by one,\nfinger vibrating with righteous rage. “A banker… a miller… a baker… and\na Styrian agent!”\nIt sounded like the start of a bad joke, but there had been little to laugh\nat since Judge had her predecessor tossed from the Tower of Chains.\nRisinau had swapped the old liars on the benches for new ones, ripped out\nthe stained glass and turned the Lords’ Round into the Commons’ Round.\nJudge had installed clumsy boxes, docks, rails of rough-sawn wood,\nsplattered the marble walls with slogans and turned it into the Court of the\nPeople. In the morning, Representatives wrestled over the details of\ngovernment every bit as ineffectually as they had before. From the moment\nJudge flung herself into the chair where Risinau used to sit, her dirty feet\npropped on the High Table, court was in session and the people’s enemies\nshould tremble.\n“The banker lent the money,” bellowed Sworbreck, “so the miller could\nadulterate his flour, so the baker could sell bread at inflated prices, causing\nhunger and discord in the service of a Styrian plot to manipulate the\nmarkets and undermine the Great Change!”\nShrieks of horror from the overflowing public galleries.

Orso wondered how the accused\nhad been picked. What terrible roll of the dice had nudged them over the\ninvisible line from being the people to being enemies of the people? Citizen\nBrock was carefully silent, Orso noted. He had developed a fine sense for\nwhen to speak and when not to. What to say and what not to. It was coming\nto something when one wished one could have the Young Lion’s good\njudgement, as well as his wife. Orso frowned. Had he really just thought\nthat?\n“I never met them!” the Styrian woman was wailing, wringing her\nhands. “I never even met them before now!”\nOrso winced at her strong accent, which drew instant jeers from above.\nAny hint of difference aroused suspicion. Be watchful! screamed one slogan\nhacked into the wall in letters twice the height of a man. Freedom means\nPunishment, roared another in streaky red. Conspiracies are everywhere!\nGurkish Eaters sent by the Prophet Khalul to debase the coinage. Imperial\nruses to weaken the People’s Army and annex the Near Country. Styrian\nplots to spread the rot through infected whores. Even Angland, Starikland\nand Westport were filthy with regression, royalism and treachery against the\nGreat Change.\nOrso had intimate personal experience of government and felt petty\nselfishness, incompetence and bad luck were far more likely explanations\nfor its shortcomings than intricate webs of malice spanning the Circle of the\nWorld. But then they were far less satisfying explanations, too. He rather\nwished the wilder theories were true. Had there been half as many secret\nmonarchists as people claimed he would never have been deposed. Then he\nmight have been sitting in that gilded chair presiding over his own, more\npolite brand of rank injustice. The crowned puppet for Bayaz to dangle\nbefore the nation with one hand while he picked its pocket with the other.\nThe grinning figurehead of a ship crewed by ruthless torturers like Old\nSticks, self-serving embezzlers like Lord Isher, brutal users like Lord\nWetterlant.\nOrso winced and rubbed at the bridge of his nose.\nSworbreck was dealing with the baker first. He was a chubby man,\nwhich made him look guilty of eating well, and he was sweating profusely,\nwhich made him look guilty of being warm, both of them capital crimes in\nthis lean winter of the Great Change.\n“I been a baker twenty years,” he was saying. “My father was a baker.”\n“Hoarders!” someone screamed.\n“Take ’em to the Tower!”\n“Take ’em all!”\nThe Styrian woman clutched her face with her hands as if she wanted to\ncrush it between them. “Mercy!” she blubbed. “Mercy!”\nThe court was not without it. Judge was the voice of the mob. She was\ntheir bitter rage, their envy and their greed, but she was also their\nsentimental forgiveness.

When the mood turned for some well-spoken old\nman, some innocent-looking young woman, first Judge’s chin would\ncrinkle, then her lower lip would tremble, then her black eyes would well\nwith tears. Sometimes she would vault from behind the High Table, kiss the\naccused, clasp their head to her rusted breastplate. Then they would be\nembraced by weeping guards, applauded on their way out of the hall while\nsongs were sung and slogans chanted, free Citizens and Citizenesses,\nenemies no more!\nPerhaps Judge liked seeing the hope in the eyes of the accused, so she\ncould see it crushed. Perhaps she truly believed she was doing the good\nwork and rejoiced in those righteously acquitted as much as those rightfully\nconvicted. Perhaps—surely the most terrible possibility of all—she was\ndoing the good work, and somehow he could not see it.\nThe baker was trying to defend himself, but how to prove false what was\nself-evidently absurd? “I charged the lowest prices I could and still stay in\nbusiness! But flour’s gone up so high—”\n“And so we come to you!” roared Sworbreck at the miller. He was bony\nand severe, with a habit of peering up shiftily from under his brows that did\nhim no favours.\n“There was a poor harvest!” he barked out. “Now the cold weather’s\nfrozen the canals, snarled up the roads. It’s hard to get goods into the city.”\n“Ah, so the government is to blame?” Sworbreck spread his arms\ntowards the benches behind the dock, where the Representatives gravely\nshook their heads at such a slander. “And since the government consists of\nthose chosen by the people…” Sworbreck leaned back, raised his arms to\nthe balconies. “The people are to blame?”\n“It’s not a question of blame!” shouted the miller, hardly heard over the\ninsults pouring from above. “It’s about facts!”\nBut it was not about facts at all and was very much a question of blame\nas far as the public galleries were concerned. Someone threw something. A\ncoin? It missed the miller and hit the Styrian woman on the forehead. She\ngave a shriek, slumping in the dock.\n“Who fucking threw that?” screamed Judge, veins bulging from her\nrashy neck. Captain Broad, who’d been lurking behind the High Table\nsipping from a hip flask, now burst forth, flinging a chair out of his way and\nsending it bouncing across the tiled floor, making everyone within twenty\nstrides, including Orso, shrink back.\n“Who fucking threw that?” he roared, the tendons starting from his great\nfists, made furious by Judge’s fury as surely as a dog by its master’s. In the\nguilty silence that followed, the banker’s efforts at a defence could finally\nbe heard.\n“I merely worked for the Banking House of Valint and Balk, I never\nprofited personally from any—”\n“Usurer!” someone screeched. No doubt there were profiteers and\nspeculators everywhere. Before the Great Change they had simply called\nthat business, and the worst offenders had been celebrated as society’s\ngreatest successes.\nThe banker’s cracked lenses flashed as he glanced nervously upwards."

Before the Great Change they had simply called\nthat business, and the worst offenders had been celebrated as society’s\ngreatest successes.\nThe banker’s cracked lenses flashed as he glanced nervously upwards.\n“As you see…” He balanced a heavy ledger on the rail so the densely\nwritten numbers were angled towards Sworbreck. “The loans I handled\nwere mostly to mining interests, mineral exploration, some foundries.”\nRepresentatives craned forwards to squint at the figures. Judge wrinkled\nher nose. Evidence in general was of little interest to her, but paperwork she\ntreated with particular disdain.\n“This one typical, you see, six thousand marks—”\n“The court has not the time to indulge in this trivia,” grumbled\nSworbreck, waving it away.\nThe man began to look alarmed. He had clearly considered this a cast-\niron defence. “But… these ledgers prove my innocence—”\n“Bastard!” someone shouted. “Liar!”\n“Enough numbers,” snarled Judge. “Get rid of the bloody books!”\nThe thin Burner, Sarlby, seized the ledger. He and the banker wrestled\nover it, paper ripping.\n“But the numbers prove— Ah!”\nSarlby finally tore the book free and started to beat the banker over the\nhead with it. His co-defendants stared in horror, but the public gallery was\nthoroughly entertained.\n“Make him eat it!” Someone screeched with laughter. “Make him eat\nit!”\n“Order in the fucking court!” roared Judge.\nSarlby flung the ledger away, pages flapping, and it spun across the tiled\nfloor. The banker stood gasping, eye-lenses skewed, collar torn, blood\nrunning from a gash on his scalp. “The numbers…” he breathed,\nastonished, “prove…”\nOrso put his hands over his face and watched from between his fingers.\nThe poor man had it backwards. Whatever the question, the Great Change\nwas the answer. That was a fact none dared challenge. So the scarcity, the\nfailures, the defeats, must be caused by profiteering, betrayal and\nconspiracy. If you could only purge all the disloyal, all the unfaithful, all the\nforeign agents, then there would be victory. Then there would be plenty.\nThat the prescription was killing the patient could only mean that not\nenough had been administered. It was not a rational argument. Facts were\nuseless against it. It was an argument based on faith. It belonged in a\ntemple, not a court. The irony, of course, was that the Burners had burned\nthe temples. So they had turned the Lords’ Round into a temple and called it\na court.\nAnd none are more fanatical in their faith than the convert. Sworbreck\nstrutted across the tiled floor until he stood before the weeping Styrian.\n“And you!” he screeched. “You were the mastermind!”\nThe woman stared, her lip wobbling, her bloody hand clapped to the\ncoin wound. Rarely had Orso seen anyone look less like the mastermind of\nanything. The pink point of her tongue darted over her pale lips, breath\ncoming fast. Blind panic, and who could blame her? Orso felt his shoulders\nsag. Everyone in the court knew what came next."

The only outcomes here\nwere acquittal or the Tower of Chains. Hildi stared at Judge, and Broad, and\nSarlby, and the red-smeared Burners jeering from the public gallery.\n“They’re monsters,” Orso heard her whisper.\n“I almost wish they were,” he muttered. “That would be easier. But\nthey’re just people.”\n“They’re the worst people I ever saw.”\n“Of course they are. We hanged all the best ones. The ones who might\nhave helped, might have compromised, might have built bridges, we left\ndangling over the road to Valbeck. Of course they are cruel, and greedy, and\nbrutal.

It\nwas too late the moment they were put in the dock. There was only one real\nconspiracy here. To find people to blame, and they were all complicit.\nJudge tossed down her hammer and sat back, picking her teeth. “What’s\nfor lunch?” she asked.\nWorse Than Murder\n“D\namn,” whispered Tallow, steam puffing about his face, “it’s cold.” And\nhe wrapped his thin arms tight around his thin ribs, and worked his chin into\nhis scarf.\nVick’s brother used to do the selfsame thing, in the camps. Bundled up\nin every scrap of cloth they had, huddled together for warmth under a\nblanket she’d got a bloody nose stealing. Gave her a sudden urge to hug\nTallow, rub his back, clamp her gloved hands over the red tips of his ears.\nBut Sibalt was the last man she hugged, and he ended up slitting his own\nthroat. So she hawked up cold snot and sent it spinning into the frozen dirt\nbeside the cart instead.\n“Why do you never have enough clothes?”\n“No one’s got enough clothes now.”\n“Scarf on a Constable. Not exactly fearsome, is it?”\n“More fearsome than froze to death, I daresay.”\nVick conceded that with a smoky grunt. He’d hardly be the first one\nfroze to death, they were finding them every morning. In alleyways. In\ndoorways. In cellars. Frost in their eyebrows. Ground was frozen too hard\nto bury the poor bastards.\n“Don’t you ever get cold?” he asked."

Letting it show is the same as asking for more. “Got colder\nthan this, in the camps.

Curtains\nembroidered with the devices of great families. Cutlery stamped with\npatriotic mottos. Flags. Uniforms. Wigs. Fans. Anything that could be\nconsidered aristocratic. A Burner stomped from a house and flung a full set\nof crockery splintering into the blaze.

This cellar\nwas a branch of the Banking House of Valint and Balk, as much as the\ngrand building on the Four Corners.” The one in which that vast vault door\nwas still frustrating every effort of locksmiths, engineers and Gurkish Fire.\n“The roots of these vile institutions have dug into every part of Union\nsociety.” Pike’s lip curled as he watched more paperwork flung into the cart.\n“A web of debts and corruption that stretches from the lowest to the highest.\nTheir rot must be hacked away.” Two Constables had dragged a squealing\nclerk into the street. “Without doubt.” Sticks rose and fell, black against the\nfire. “Without hesitation.” A limp body was hauled away, head hanging."

Lot of desperate people. They’re\ncoming in from all over. Looking for work, when there’s less work than\never. Mills closing. Manufactories shuttered. No coal. No food.” Vick\nlicked her sore lips as she watched the shackled employees of Valint and\nBalk hauled from their cellar. “No money.”\n“We must focus on the grand crimes. Let the Burners worry about the\npetty ones.”\nVick winced down the street towards the bonfire. They weren’t burning\npeople on it, as far as she could tell, but only because Judge wanted the\nproper show of pushing them off the Tower of Chains later.\nShe should’ve kept her mouth shut. She always kept her mouth shut.\nBut somehow it was getting harder and harder to keep her mouth\nshut. “With respect, Commissioner, the Burners are as likely to punish\nthe innocent as the guilty.”\nPike hardly seemed to hear her. “The banks remain our focus. Usury is\nthe worst of crimes.”\n“Worse than murder?”\n“Murder leaves one Citizen dead. The banks infect us all with greed.”\nThe flames down the street glimmered in the corners of Pike’s eyes. “Are\nwe any closer to finding the manager of the Adua headquarters of Valint and\nBalk? I would very much like to see the inside of their vault.”\n“We’re closing in. Questioning the employees. But there are hundreds,\nand most only know their little splinter of the business. The bank owns\nproperty all across the city. No one would ever have believed how much.”\n“We will take it all back,” said Pike, “and give it to the people.”\nVick glanced towards the fire. “What’ll they do with it?”\n“Sometimes, to change the world we must first—”\n“Burn it down,” she finished, softly. But it was sounding more and more\nlike something a madman says to justify all the fires he loves to start. “If the\nmanager’s in the city, we’ll find him.”\nPike gave her a stiff nod. “Keep me informed.” And he strode away, a\ndozen Constables in tow, past someone standing in the shadows of a\ndoorway on the far side of the street. A woman with a board propped\nagainst her hip, bright eyes darting over Pike and his retinue, towards the\ncellar and the cart, away to the firelit crowd.\n“Make sure this all gets to the House of Truth,” Vick grunted at Tallow.\n“We call it the House of Purity now, remember?”"

Best to approach everyone as if they\nwere a threat, though this woman didn’t look too formidable. Her lips had a\nbluish tinge, nostrils pink at the rims, an old quilt around her shoulders with\na hole cut for her head to go through.\n“Your name, Citizeness?”\n“Groom, Inspector. Carmee Groom.” She lowered the board. There was\na sheet of paper clipped to it, a stub of charcoal in the blackened fingers of\nher other hand. “I’m an artist.”\nVick relaxed a little. About as much as she ever did. “So I see.”\n“I am sketching. For a painting.”\nVick frowned towards the bonfire, the ragged figures warming their\nhands, the Burners dragging people from the buildings, the Constables\nemptying out the cellar that had been a bank. “You want to paint this?”\n“Future generations might never believe that it happened.” She blew\nsome yellow hair out of her face with a smoky breath and went back to\nsketching, charcoal hissing on paper. “Then it might happen again.”\nLessons\n“T\nhere was a hell of a battle fought here,” said Shivers, pausing on the\nside of the hill to frown across the snow-covered valley, all silent in that\nbrittle way only winter countryside can be.\nIsern gave a smoky snort. “You could say that of all the North. Is there a\nstride of sod, anywhere ’twixt the Crinna and the Whiteflow, hasn’t been\nwatered with blood at one time or another?”\n“Not like it was here,” said Shivers. “Greatest battle the North ever saw.\nBlack Dow had his standard on this very hill.” He pointed to the white\nfields below them on their right, slashed by black walls, studded with black\ntrees. “Scale down there, still wi’ both hands, and Brodd Tenways, and\nCairm Ironhead, Glama Golden, Caul Reachey over on the left, in Osrung.”\nAs Rikke struggled up level with him he turned around and carried on\nclimbing. “Every one of ’em back to the mud.”\n“Well,” said Isern, using her spear like a walking stick, “being a War\nChief is a business heaped high with both risks and rewards.”\n“Lord Marshal Kroy stood on the other side,” said Shivers, “and\nthousands o’ Union soldiers, and your father, too. Three red days we had of\nit. Men struggled here with all they had for each step of ground. Died and\nkilled for every handful of soil.” He frowned out at the crisp, quiet white,\nstretching away to the hazy fells all around, and shook his head like he\ncouldn’t make it fit. “Now you’d never know. Few years passed and… it’s\njust fields.”\n“You’ve turned talkative,” said Rikke. She couldn’t remember the last\ntime he’d said this much in one afternoon."

She couldn’t remember the last\ntime he’d said this much in one afternoon.\n“Brings it all back, I guess, being here.” Shivers stepped over the crest\nof the hill and onto its flat top, frowning towards the great ring of stones\nthey called the Heroes, black against the white sky, like the prongs on a\ngiant’s crown. “The good and the bad.”\n“No trouble planting your flag here now.” And Corleth stuck Rikke’s\nrolled-up standard of the Long-Eye into the snow, her face all blotched pink\nfrom the cold.\nOne of the stones was broken halfway up, a couple more had toppled\ndown the centuries, another sheared off and cloven by a crack, like it was\ndealt a blow with a mighty hammer. Rikke stepped over to the nearest and\nkicked the snow from her boots against its side. By the dead, it was a size.\nFour times a man’s height or more, topped with snow, streaked with wet,\nspattered with lichen, crusted with moss.\n“How did they get the bastard things up here?” Her face was pinched\nand her chest raw from the winter but her body all sticky-hot from the climb\nunder her cloak, so she couldn’t decide whether to draw it tight or fling it\noff. “Just getting myself up here was a struggle.”\n“This is where Black Dow fought Calder.” Shivers was standing at the\nedge of the ring of stones, looking in at the snow-covered circle of tangled\ngrass and thistle inside. “A duel to the death.”\n“Aye, and you cheated,” said Isern, “and dinged Black Dow in the back\nof the head with that sword you’re wearing, and so Calder became Black\nCalder, and stole the North, and gave Skarling’s Chair to his brother to sit\nin, who gave it to his nephew to sit in.” She stuck her bottom lip out and\nscratched at her throat. “Come to think of it, all this is your fault.”\nShivers frowned down at the grey hilt of his sword, then over at Isern.\n“Calder seemed the better choice, then.”\n“And now?”\n“And now,” said Rikke, “there’s no unpicking the warp and weft of all\nthe things said and done since that day. It’s not a right choice or a wrong,\nany more than wind blown or snow fallen.” And gingerly, as if she was\nlaying her hand on a sleeping dog, she put her palm to one of the stones.\nMaybe she’d hoped for her Long Eye to pop open and show her hidden\ntruths, but if there’d been high magic here it was long faded, or at any rate\nshe hadn’t the key to unlock it. It was just a stone.\nCorleth pulled out a flask, took a little nip and offered it around. “Seems\nyour friend’s not here yet.”\n“He’s no friend,” said Rikke, taking a nip of her own.\n“Then we can trot off ’fore he arrives,” said Isern. “You took Uffrith\nwithout his help, and you took Carleon without his help, and you’ve took\nhalf the North without his help, and now he slinks up, sniffing about like a"

You don’t need his help getting your hands on the\nother half.”\n“Might need his help keeping the half I’ve got, the way things are\ngoing.”\n“’Twas your own cockiness set things going that way, d’you see. Did I\nnot say cockiness was the grave you’d trip into if you didn’t mind your\nstep?”\n“Only about a thousand times. Can’t hurt to hear the man out.”\nIsern turned her head, spat chagga juice and left a brown streak down\nher chin. “You’ll be telling me next it can’t hurt putting a crab down your\ntrousers.”\n“Aye, well,” grunted Rikke, handing the flask to Shivers, “my trousers,\nmy choice to make.”\n“No doubt, ’tis only that the choice you’re making is a very poor one, as\nmost of your choices have been since your skinny arse touched Skarling’s\nChair.”\nRikke ground her teeth. “I could tire of your slighting references to my\narse.”\n“And I could tire of your way of managing the North.”\n“Oh, you’ve made that very clear. I think what first gave it away is how\nyou keep saying it, straight to my face, in front of anyone who’ll listen.”\n“A wise leader sups well upon the wisdom of their advisors.”\n“It’s a shame my advisors don’t have any, then, isn’t it?”\n“Oy,” said Shivers, lowering the flask. “I’ve a lifetime o’ defeats to draw\non.” Rikke ignored him.\n“There was a time your lessons smacked of wisdom, Isern-i-Phail. Now\nthey smack of mad witterings summoned on the spot. Or worse yet, the\nmaddest bits picked out from your father’s mad witterings, like a drunk\nsquirrel picking nuts from a turd. I could do without the constant whittling\ndown of my authority.”\n“One cannot much whittle what is hardly there,” snapped Isern. “First\nyou shat yourself with the Nail, now you think Jonas Clover’s the jug to\nhold all our hopes?”\n“There are some tasks trustworthy men aren’t suited to,” growled Rikke.\n“You catch rabbits with weasels, not with bulls.”\n“That’s one weasel might end up down your trousers.”\n“What is this obsession with animals down my trousers?”\n“I don’t get it, either,” muttered Corleth.\n“You can shut your face, girl!” snarled Isern, rounding on her and\nshaking her spear in her face. “’Fore I give it a shutting from which it will\nnot soon open.”\n“Don’t carp at her!” Rikke stepped between the two of them. “You’ve\nhad it in for her from the start and all she’s tried to do is help. By the dead,\nyour bloody carping! Have you ever heard of a woman with such a tongue\nfor carping as this one, Corleth?”\nCorleth blinked at Isern, then at Rikke, and swallowed. “Honestly, I’d\nrather not get stuck between the two o’ you.”"

See how\ngenerous she is? You couldn’t carp any more if you were a carp.”\nIsern’s knuckles were white on the haft of her spear. “Saved you, didn’t\nI? In the woods? In the winter? Not bad for a fish.”\n“You did save me, and my ears are sore from being reminded, and my\nthroat’s raw from thanking you for it. If I was planning to get lost in the\nwoods again you’d be my first pick for a companion. But since I’m\nplanning to sit in Skarling’s Chair, I’m beginning to doubt you’re fitted for\nthe role.” She waved her hand towards Corleth. “There are folk with\nleveller heads and sweeter tempers one could have at one’s elbow.”\nIsern narrowed her eyes. “That a fact?”\n“It is! And if it’s a hard one to swallow, you can take yourself back into\nthe hills whence you came and make houses out o’ shit or whatever it is\nyour lot do up there. You made a promise to my father, but my father’s back\nto the mud and as far as I’m concerned your promise went with him, d’you\nsee.” And Rikke made a mocking imitation of Isern’s hillwoman accent on\nthe d’you see which she was rather pleased with.\nIsern was less pleased. Indeed, she’d had a look of gathering fury during\nthat last speech which was slightly troubling and made Rikke wonder\nwhether she might’ve taken at least one step too far. “Well, have a shit,\nthen, you little ingrate maggot!” she snarled, spraying chagga juice and\nmaking Rikke flinch back. “You little painted piss-smear! You fucking one-\neyed wanker!”\n“There’s some very pleasant one-eyed folk,” grunted Shivers.\n“My arse to you!” hissed Isern in Rikke’s face. “And the moon’s curse\nto you and the dead drip on your Long Eye. You can roll your own chagga!”\nAnd she stalked off in high dudgeon, the very highest, indeed, shouldering\nCorleth aside, between the stones and away to the north the way they’d\ncome.\n“I’ve a fear…” said Shivers, his scarred brow furrowed in a frown.\n“That was a mistake.”\n“Wasn’t my first,” snapped Rikke, well aware of what she’d done, “and I\ndoubt it’ll be my last.”\n“Surely. But you might want to spread ’em out a bit.”\n“Daresay she’ll be back,” muttered Corleth, though she looked less than\nconvinced and in fact slightly scared.\n“Don’t care a monthly bleed whether she is or isn’t,” snapped Rikke.\n“Away to fuck with you!” she roared after Isern, whose shaggy head was\ndisappearing behind the frozen grass on the hilltop. She didn’t answer."

She didn’t answer.\n“A bad time?” came a voice, from behind.\nAnd there he stood. No arcane robes or golden wands. Just a worn old\ncoat and a time-polished stick, the winter sun gleaming on his bald head. He\nwasn’t breathing hard, though the dead knew there was no way to get to the\nHeroes without climbing the hill it stood on. It was as if he’d been there the\nwhole time, but they’d only just now noticed him.\n“Bayaz!” Rikke stowed her mood away and strolled towards him with a\nsmile, boots crunching in that circle of fresh snow, the Heroes a ring of\ndisapproving giants frowning on their meeting. “First of the Magi! First\napprentice of great Juvens! Don’t I feel special to get an audience?”\n“Rikke of the Long Eye!” He walked towards her, not seeming quite so\nsmart and smug as he had in the Hall of Mirrors in Adua. He had a hungry\nlook now. Sunken around the eyes. Scratty about the beard. “Daughter of\nthe Dogman, mistress of Uffrith, Carleon and half the North besides. You\nhave grown a great deal since we last saw one another.”\n“That’ll be the hood,” said Rikke, “gives me an inch at least.” And as\nthey came together in the centre of the circle she pushed her hood back, and\ndragged her hair over to the side, and turned her left eye towards him.\nFor an instant, she saw the flicker of shock. “Grown not so much in\nstature,” he breathed, eyes flickering over her face with keen curiosity, “as\nin power. Who tattooed the runes around your Long Eye?”\n“A friend. Up in the hills.”\n“A friend of rare talent, in these latter days. Eleven wards, and eleven\nwards reversed. Truly a most potent enchantment! I feel more blessed than\never that you consented to a meeting.”\nRikke wasn’t above being pleased by flattery. But she was above letting\nit show. “Man o’ your age, outdoors in such bitter weather, figured it must\nbe important.” And she grinned wide. Your best shield is a smile, her father\nused to say, and she’d a feeling she might need a shield or two in this\nconversation. “Besides, I was in the neighbourhood. Business in Osrung.”\nAnd she waved towards the thin smoke rising from the town’s chimneys,\noff down the river. “Been taking a little tour of the North. Or the bits I’m in\ncharge of.”\n“And how have you found it?”\n“Seems I’m more in charge of some bits than others,” she said, casting a\nfrown after Isern. “No easy business, keeping a crowd of Northmen all\nfacing one way.”\n“I have been trying for centuries and it never seems to stick. When we\nmet in Adua, I told you we should speak later.”\n“So later has arrived,” said Rikke.\n“It’s got a habit of doing that,” murmured Shivers, whose watchful\npresence a pace or two behind her she was rather grateful for."

For better or worse it is done, and set, and littered with\ndisappointments as a battlefield is littered with the dead. But the future is a\nploughed field, full of potential. The future we can twist into wonderful\nshapes. With my help, the North could be yours. All of it, and not only for\ntoday. Imagine all the good we could do together.”\n“Who says I want to do good?”\n“Isn’t that what we all want?” Bayaz gave a sigh through his nose.\n“History is not the story of battles between right and wrong, but between\none man’s right and another’s. Evil is not the opposite of good. It is what\nwe call another man’s notion of good when it differs from ours.”\nRikke had her doubts on that score. “So you want to help me stamp my\nnotions on the North?”\n“Why not? We all need help, from time to time.”\n“Oh, we do. All I’ve got was got with help.” She’d come a full circle\nnow, and she patted Shivers fondly on the shoulder as she passed, then\nturned to Bayaz with a thoughtful frown, still walking, slowly, crunch,\ncrunch, crunch. She’d never liked standing still. “Bethod had your help, if I\nheard the story right. How’s he getting along?”\n“I made him king. But he grew arrogant, and fell.”\n“The Bloody-Nine, I think, had your help next. How’s he faring?”\n“I made him king, too. But he grew wrathful, and fell.”\n“Then it was Black Calder who had your help. He must’ve prospered!”\n“I made him the man who made kings,” said Bayaz as she passed behind\nhis back, then he turned his head and caught her from the corner of his eye.\n“But he grew lazy, and let you in the back door. My help is not the word of\nEuz. It cannot protect a man from his own faults.”\n“So if I have your help, who’ll protect me from all my faults?”\nBayaz took an impatient breath, like the teacher of a pupil who can’t get\ntheir sums straight. “I know things have not gone smoothly for you lately. I\nknow some of your friends are friends no more. The Nail, and his people in\nthe West Valleys. Even the hillwoman Isern-i-Phail loses patience. I know,\non your little tour of the North, you are thought of as too soft, too wild, too\nstrange. But then, as your list of names shows, sitting in Skarling’s Chair is\none thing. Staying there is another.”\nShe’d finished another circle now, leaving him in the centre of a ring of\nher snowy footprints, and she looked him in the eye. “You know a lot.”"

I could share mine with you.”\nRikke doubted Bayaz became Bayaz by sharing more than he had to. “I\nsee things, too,” she said, turning her left eye towards him and opening it\nvery wide. “Who knows? Maybe even a thing or two you don’t. I know\nthings haven’t gone smoothly for you lately. You left the North in Black\nCalder’s care and he pissed his trousers. His brother’s dead and his son’s in\na cage and now you have to listen to me flap my lips. And then there’s your\nUnion, where I saw you give such a fine address, the countless little people\nlaid out before you like a carpet before an emperor. I doubt you’d be so\nwelcome since their Great Change, eh? Not so many statues of you in the\nAgriont as there were. And who can blame ’em? Wasn’t long ago you gave\nthem your help, and it laid waste to their proud city and killed them by the\ncartload. Or did my father tell the story wrong?”\n“Talking to you is quite the adventure.” The weather might’ve been\nbitter, but the edge on Bayaz’s voice was chillier yet. “You wander off in\nevery direction.”\n“I’m a constant surprise even to myself!”\nOne more impatient puff of smoke, this time through gritted teeth, like a\nshepherd whose flock won’t obey. “Do you see these stones, child?”\n“I do.” And she set off wandering again, over towards the cloven one.\n“They’re hard to miss, old man.”\n“This is where Black Dow died. This very spot. He ruled the North, after\nthe Bloody-Nine fell. A mighty warrior. A fearsome leader. He held off the\nUnion here. But he thought he could manage without me.” Bayaz narrowed\nhis eyes towards the flat, white country spread out to the north. “He lies in a\npit out there, unmarked and unconsidered.”\n“The Great Leveller catches us all,” said Shivers, softly.\n“And he has no favourites and makes no exceptions.” Rikke reached up\nto run her fingertips down the great split in the stone, already a little\nsmoothed, a little weathered in the years since the battle. “Where did the\nstones come from?” she asked.\nThe First of the Magi frowned. “The Heroes?”\n“Aye. Who put them here? And how? And why?”\n“None alive know that.” Bayaz glared over at Corleth, and she\nswallowed, and blinked down at the ground. “They come from an age\nbefore the Old Time. They were ancient even when my master Juvens was\nborn.”\n“So old as that? A good thing stones don’t wrinkle, eh, or run to flab, or\nlose their hair, or have all their little schemes fall apart around ’em? I\ndaresay they mostly look as fine as the day they were raised. Though how\ndid this one get so bruised? Magus Art?”\nBayaz frowned harder. “No.”\n“A cannon,” said Shivers.\n“A cannon!” It was hard to walk back towards the magus. Like walking"

Like walking\ninto a great wind. But Rikke made herself swan carefree across the snow,\nleaving a new track of footprints in the white. “Like the ones my good\nfriend Savine dan Brock, who gave me these lovely emeralds, turns out by\nthe dozen in her new foundry in Ostenhorm. So I know not whence the\nstones came, either, but I know what broke that one. In this matter, at least,\nit looks like I’m as wise as you. There was a time of stones before you. And\nthere will be a time of cannons after. And the time before was, and the time\nafter will be, so vasty and so deep that the age of your mastery will seem\nlike the snapping of a child’s fingers.” And she snapped hers in Bayaz’s\nface. Click.\nHis eye gave the slightest twitch of annoyance. “It appears that Tricky\nRikke is a name well earned.”\n“And Sticky Rikke, too,” she muttered from the side of her mouth, “I\npromise you.”\n“No doubt there will be a time after me.” Bayaz’s eyes were fixed on\nhers, hard and glittering green. “But that time is not yet. For a girl blessed\nwith the Long Eye, you have made some short-sighted blunders.”\nShe got as close to a carefree shrug as she could, no easy thing, with the\nweight of his displeasure on her shoulders. “You told me once that people\nmust be allowed to make their own mistakes.”\nHis eyes narrowed, and he closed the gap between them with one step.\nShe felt Shivers shift behind her, the faint rattle as he gripped his sword,\nand she had just the presence of mind to raise one finger to still him.\n“You are very brave,” said the First of the Magi, and his voice was\nalmost painful on her ear. “Or very rash. To cavil with a man who has\ncalled up storms and snatched down lightning. Who scattered the mighty\nHundred Words like chaff on the wind.” He leaned forwards, baring his\nteeth, and it was the most she could do to stop herself cringing, stumbling\nback, dropping to her knees. “Why, you must know, that with a thought I\ncould make ash of you.”\nNow that was a hard moment. Worse than hiding in an icy stream while\nshe heard her death plotted on the bank. Worse than when she watched the\nYoung Lion losing to the Great Wolf. Worse than when\nshe had to choose which eye to have pricked out. It took all she had to\nmeet Bayaz’s gaze. All she’d learned and all she’d lost. As if his anger was\na crushing grip, squeezing the breath from her chest. But she did it. Then\nshe pushed her lips out in a thoughtful pout, then she pressed her finger\nagainst them for a moment, then she shrugged.\n“No,” she said brightly. “I don’t see it. If everyone knew you chose the\nkings, and you had all the power, they might get it in their heads to take it\nfrom you. I reckon you’d sooner stay behind the curtain, where it’s safe,\nand have others do the burning.”"

        "text": "kings, and you had all the power, they might get it in their heads to take it\nfrom you. I reckon you’d sooner stay behind the curtain, where it’s safe,\nand have others do the burning.”\nThere was a chilly silence, then, as the cold wind cut between the stones\nand across the snow-heavy grass. A hard and chilly silence, stretching long,\nwhile Rikke wondered if she might’ve made her last mistake. Then the first\nof the Magi gave a sigh, and stepped back, and the awful pressure was\nreleased.\n“Then you have made your choice. Perhaps I will go to Currahome.\nBlack Calder, I think, will be grateful for my support.”\n“I expect so,” she said, trying to stop her voice quavering with relief.\n“He needs it. Perhaps, when I’ve settled with him, we should talk again. By\nthat time, you might want to buy secrets from me! Fare you well, First of\nthe Magi.”\n“I would say fare you well, Rikke of the Long Eye.” He gave her the\nhint of a smile, even as he turned away. “But I fear you will fare badly.”\nAnd he walked swiftly between the stones, and was soon gone down the\nside of the hill.\nCorleth puffed out her cheeks and rubbed sweat from her forehead on\nthe back of her hand. “Don’t much care for that old bastard,” she muttered.\n“Nor I,” murmured Rikke, folding her arms and hoping her thumping\nheart would soon settle.\nShivers was frowning towards the white fells on the south side of the\nvalley. “He was here, after the battle.”\n“I guess there were a lot o’ crows, picking at the leftovers.”\n“Him in particular. When Black Calder and the Union and your father\nstruck a deal.”\n“And my father spat in Calder’s hand and swore to kill him if he ever\ncrossed the Cusk again.”\n“That’s right. Bayaz was the one pulling all the strings.”\n“Well, he won’t be plucking ours.”\nShivers’ good eye turned towards her. “Better to have ’em plucked than\ncut, maybe.”\n“Maybe.” But her father fought all his life so they could be free. She\ngave a shiver, and pulled her fur collar tight and her hood low, and headed\nback the way they’d come. Northwards, leaving the Heroes behind. “Till\nthen, we’ll dance to our own tune.”\nFar from Finished\nC\nlover nudged some wet bushes out of the way and peered across the\nriver. His eyes weren’t all they once were, but he’d an unpleasant sense\nthere were some familiar faces at the far end of the bridge.\n“By the dead, my luck,” he muttered, trying to catch any warmth his\nbreath might hold in his cupped hands. “Is that Trapper and his boys?”\n“Aye,” said Sholla. “The ones Downside didn’t kill, leastways.”\n“Better that than leave scores at your back,” said Downside.\nSholla rolled her eyes. “And what about the score Trapper has against us\n’cause you killed three of his people?”\nDownside scratched his thick beard as he pondered that. “So you’re\nsaying… I should’ve killed the rest, too?”"

        "text": "’cause you killed three of his people?”\nDownside scratched his thick beard as he pondered that. “So you’re\nsaying… I should’ve killed the rest, too?”\nClover sighed. “Life surely has a way of bringing old offences back to\nhaunt you.”\n“Was only a few weeks back,” said Flick.\n“New offences, then.” Clover had arrived with small expectations of\nliving out the day and his odds just took another tumble. “You lot better stay\nout here.”\n“I’d no idea you cared, Chief.”\n“I don’t.” He raised a brow at Flick. “But you’re so dumb you’d make\nthings worse.” He pointed it at Sholla. “And you’re far too skinny to hide\nbehind.” He pointed it at Downside. “And let’s not even start on you.”\n“Sure you want to wear that?” asked Sholla. “For this?”\nClover frowned down at the fine wolfskin cloak Stour used to wear. She\nhad a point. Turning up to talk to Black Calder in his stolen son’s stolen\nfinery would be less than wise. “Shit,” he said, undoing the buckle with\nsome reluctance, since it was by no means the weather for disrobing, and\ntossed it over to Sholla. “If my luck’s a lot better’n usual, I’ll see you back\nhere soon.”\n“And if your luck’s about like usual?” Sholla hissed after him, grinning\nas she pulled the cloak about her own bony shoulders.\n“Then I reckon you got a good cloak out of it.” And Clover stepped from\nthe trees, wedged his hands under his armpits and trudged towards the\nbridge.\nTrapper stood at the far end with his thumbs in his sword-belt and a\nwrinkle to his lip. “If it isn’t Jonas fucking Clover.”\n“It’s the longer version of my name,” said Clover, already shivering,\n“but used often enough that I’m obliged to answer to it.”\n“Funny.” It was the one with the lambskin coat, the one Downside\ncoshed on the head last time they met. “I’d find the sight of your guts\nfunnier yet.”\n“You don’t seem to be killing me, mind you.”\nTrapper turned his head and sourly spat. “No.”\n“A better result than I’d expected, if I’m honest.”\n“Aye. Black Calder told us you’d be along.”\n“How did he know?”\n“He’s Black Calder, ain’t he? Knowing things is what he’s known for.”\nHe held out his hand and snapped his fingers.\n“Right y’are.” Clover unbuckled his sword-belt and handed it over.\nCould scarcely remember the last time he drew the damn thing except to oil\nit anyway. “You should know I regret what happened last time we met,” he\nsaid, following Trapper up the muddy road. “Didn’t want anyone dead, but\nbloody Downside, he’s one o’ those bastards leaves a trail o’ wreckage with\nevery stride.”\n“You choose to have a man like that in your crew, you could do a better\njob o’ reining him in.” Trapper shook his head in disgust. “You could hardly\nhave done a worse.”\n“Not entirely fair,” said Clover. “You’re still casting a shadow.”"

        "text": "job o’ reining him in.” Trapper shook his head in disgust. “You could hardly\nhave done a worse.”\n“Not entirely fair,” said Clover. “You’re still casting a shadow.”\nNo surprise that they walked the rest of the way in moody silence. There\nwas snow on the sloping fields, and the low stone walls, and the bare trees\non the valley side, and on the steep roofs of the houses scattered towards the\ntop. There were tents about, too, and campfires, and fighting men huddled\nclose around their warmth. Fewer than Clover had been expecting, though.\nThralls and Carls, a few grizzled old faces he recognised. Not enough to\npose any threat to Rikke, even now the Nail and his West Valley boys had\ncleared off.\nMaybe Black Calder had lost his edge. Happens to everyone, in the end.\nFolk get comfortable. Get so stuck on thinking they’re the best, the\nstrongest, the most cunning, that when someone better, stronger, more\ncunning comes along they don’t even realise they’re yesterday’s bread. Not\ntill it’s too late.\nHe was waiting, under the ice-fringed eaves of the hall at the top of the\nhill. The man who’d ruled the North for twenty years. A little greyer,\nmaybe, than last time Clover saw him. A little more lined. But wasn’t\neveryone? He looked relaxed, for a man whose dreams had all come\ncrashing down.\n“Jonas Clover!” He spread his arms like he was greeting an old friend, a\ngesture which Clover found anything but reassuring. “Welcome to\nCurrahome. What d’you think of the place?”\n“A charming winter scene,” said Clover as he looked back down the\nvalley, catching his breath and trying to rub the chill from his pink\nfingertips. “I’m climbing a lot more hills than I’d like to be at my time o’\nlife, mind you.”\nCalder waved towards the smattering of men camped on the hillside.\n“You think mustering warriors was what I’d been planning for my dotage,\nyou lazy bastard? I much preferred Carleon but my fool of a son lost it.\nGive him his sword back, Trapper, what are you doing?”\nTrapper frowned sideways at Clover. “I thought, you know, he might try\nsomething.”\n“It’s Jonas Clover, what would he try? Bad jokes? There’s probably not\neven a blade in the scabbard. Just a spare sausage or something.”\nClover felt a touch offended about that as he buckled his sword back on.\nProbably he shouldn’t have. Offence did no one any good, after all, and\nCalder was right. Trying anything here was the style o’ manly madness\nJonas Steepfield might’ve contemplated. And look what happened to that\nidiot.\n“Let’s get in out of the cold.” Calder turned towards the hall. “You’re a\nconnoisseur of sword-work, you’ll enjoy this.”\nAs the doors were opened, the unmistakable clanging of steel on steel\nrang out. Blade-music, as the skalds have it, making their living setting\npoetic terms to the world’s horrors.

        "text": "poetic terms to the world’s horrors. Shadows danced among the carved\nrafters of the firelit hall, hot as a forge after the chill outside, bringing a\nprickle to Clover’s frost-numbed extremities. Men sat on benches, drinking,\neating, oohing and ahhing at the sight of two men fighting. Or maybe\ntraining. Or one big man and a stringy lad. Seemed quite the mismatch at\nfirst, but as Clover got closer he saw it wasn’t going the way you’d expect.\nDuring his long and undistinguished career teaching sword-work, he’d\nwatched hundreds of boys practise with a blade, usually while wearing a\nlook of pained disappointment. He’d seen no more’n a dozen with any high\ntalent for the business. It wasn’t so much bravery that it took, which was\nreasonably common, as a lack of fear. Lack of fear that you’d get hurt,\nwhich was rare. Lack of fear that you’d hurt someone else which, strange to\nsay, was rarer yet.\nThick black hair was stuck to the lad’s face with sweat, and every time\nhe outfoxed the big man, or slipped around one of his efforts, or brought a\ngasp from the onlookers, he noticeably didn’t smile, or shout, or throw his\narms up in triumph. It was like his face was sculpted from pale clay and\ncould make no expression at all. Wasn’t so much a lack of fear as a hole\nwhere his fear should’ve been. There was a scar between his mouth and his\nnose. A cleft lip.\n“I know this lad,” said Clover, fumbling off his hat and scrubbing at the\nsweaty wisps stuck to his pate. “He was with you that day I offered you an\napple.”\n“He was.”\nThe boy darted around a lunge, flicked his sword out and nicked the big\nman’s hand. He gasped through clenched teeth, blade dropping to the straw.\nThe lad stepped in, sword raised.\n“Stop!” called Calder. “I don’t have so many warriors you can go\ncarving ’em up for your amusement. You remember Jonas Clover? Used to\nbe Steepfield? Won some duels?”\n“And lost one,” muttered Clover, under his breath.\n“I remember,” said the lad, watching from behind that curtain of black\nhair. Showed no sign of respect. Showed no sign of scorn. Just took it all in.\n“Don’t say much, does he?” said Clover.\n“No, but he can make a sword sing.” A thickset old bald bastard with a\nshort grey beard had stepped up beside them. Clover didn’t know his face,\nwhich was odd, since he thought he knew everyone in the North with a big\nenough name to start spilling his thoughts to Black Calder. “He reminds me\nof a young Skarling, in that regard.”\n“Really?” asked Clover, brows high, since Skarling Hoodless was back\nin the mud lifetimes ago.\n“This is Bayaz.” Calder had acquired the grin of a man keen to please,\nwhich by no means fit him well. “The First of the Magi.”\nClover raised his brows even higher. That explained a few things. His\nbeing on intimate terms with long-dead heroes for one. The way Black\nCalder scraped around him for another. He hadn’t the look of a legendary"

He hadn’t the look of a legendary\nwizard, truth be told. Thicker in the neck and quicker to smile. But there\nwas something in Bayaz’s eyes as he took Clover’s measure. Something\nthat made him think this would be a bad enemy to have.\n“Steepfield was the name?” he asked.\nClover had a policy of never setting magi right. “It was.”\n“Come to Currahome as I have, no doubt, to make sure the proper\nperson sits in Skarling’s Chair.”\nSince opinions might differ on the best arse to fill that uncomfortable\npiece of furniture, it was easy for Clover to give a hearty, “That’s right.”\n“We cannot have our plans for the North wrecked by some over-clever\ngirl with a magic eye.”\nClover cleared his throat. “Without wishing offence, seems she’s\nknocked ’em a bit crooked already.”\nBayaz’s eyes glittered in the light of the fire-pit. “Nothing that cannot be\nstraightened out again, with the right knowledge and the right friends.” All\nin good fun, it seemed, but there was a threat in there somewhere.\n“You can never have too many friends,” said Clover, while thinking that\nthere were a few a man was better off without.\nCalder was twisting one hand with the other, like a serving girl hoping\nsome lord didn’t take against the ale she’d poured him. “You know how\ngrateful I’ve always been for your help.”\n“You lacked somewhat of manners when you first came to visit me, as I\nrecall.” Bayaz peered down his nose at Calder as if he was still a prideful\npup. “But in all the years since the battle at the Heroes, my support for you\nhas never wavered.”\n“Nor mine for you.” Calder swallowed, a little queasily. “Manners\nshould be answered with like manners, I’ve always felt.”\n“Well said. If only the younger generation had your hard-won wisdom.”\nAnd Bayaz gave Clover a nod and made for the door, sparing a sideways\nsmile at that black-haired lad, already making a fool of another grown\nwarrior.\nClover frowned after him. “Haven’t I heard you say the help of magi is\nnever worth the cost?”\n“He only shows up when he knows you’ve got no choice.” Calder’s face\nhad snapped back into its frown like a bent willow switch snaps back into\nthe shape it grew in. “But there comes a time you have to play every card,\nno matter the price.” He led Clover past the fire-pit to the high chair at its\nend, leaving the clash of steel and the appreciation of the warriors behind.\n“This was my father’s hall. Before he took Carleon. This was where his\ndream of a North united was born.”\n“Like most births,” said Clover, “I hear there was a lot of blood.”\n“Couldn’t get anything done without a lot of blood in those days.”\n“And now?”\nCalder conceded the point with a little shrug of his shoulders and\ndropped into the chair Bethod must once have sat in. “You want some ale,\nClover?”"

The hard hands near\nthe hard weapons. He decided if Calder had wanted him dead he wouldn’t\nhave wasted poison, and took a sup. “But then I turned on you and your\nson.” Might’ve seemed madness to bring it up, but he judged it better to\nface it now than find it stabbing him in the arse later.\nCalder narrowed his eyes. “I’d assumed you must’ve come to tell me\nhow sorry you are for that.”\nLies would get him nowhere with Black Calder. The truth might not,\neither, but he liked the odds better. “For turning on you, I’m sorry. For\nturning on your son, I’m not.”\n“You’re saying he deserved it?”\n“I’m saying he fucking demanded it.”\nCalder sat back, tendons standing from the backs of his thin hands as he\ngripped the arms of his chair. “I heard Caul Shivers hobbled him.”\nClover wiped sweat from his forehead and tried to flap some air in\naround his collar. By the dead, it was hot in here. He was doubly glad he’d\nleft that cloak behind now. “He did. And the Nail beat the snot out of him\nand Tricky Rikke’s keeping him in the cage he had forged for his own\namusement. You can’t say she don’t have a sense of humour.”\nFury wouldn’t have surprised him, but all Calder did was stare into the\nglowing embers and slowly nod. “Might be he’ll finally learn the lessons I\ncould never bring myself to teach him. Love can be a weakness. I blame\nmyself.”\n“I’ve done a bit of that, down the years.” Clover took another swallow\nfrom his cup. “Didn’t help.”\n“Huh.” And Calder grinned at him, teeth shining in the light of the fire-\npit. “I still like you, Clover. I never can bring myself to trust loyal men.\nCan’t understand the bastards.”\n“I’m with you there.”\n“Man who’ll be loyal to someone might one day up and decide he’d\nrather be loyal to someone else.” He wagged a finger at Clover. “But a man\nwho’s first loyalty is to himself? It always will be. You don’t pretend to be\nwhat you’re not. You’re reliable.”\n“I am?”\n“Let’s say reliably unreliable. Which makes you an interesting choice of\nmessenger.”\n“She didn’t say so in so many words, but I’ve a feeling Rikke thought\nyou might not listen to someone less flexible. Might send their head back in\na bag, in fact.”\n“But I won’t send yours?”\nClover scratched gently at his sweaty neck. “Honestly, I doubt she cares\nmuch on that score either way.”\n“Clever, isn’t she?”\n“She is.”"

Towards Calder. Towards the warmth of the\nfire-pit. “She sent me with an offer. Split the North. Leave it as it is now.\nShe’ll keep Uffrith and Carleon. You’ll keep what you’ve got. And you get\nyour son back.”\nCalder watched him, in silence calm as a mountain lake. There was\nsome laughter and clapping down where the sword-work was happening.\nThere was a crunch and a whirl of sparks as a glowing log shifted in the\nfire-pit. Clover glanced around. Still the hard faces, the hard weapons. Still\nthe ever-present threat of a quick trip back to the mud.\nHe cleared his throat. “So…”\n“Truth is I’m tired, Clover.” Calder sagged back with a weary grunt.\n“Lots of folk gone back to the mud. My father, my wife, my brother.\nFriends beyond counting. I’m tired and I’m lonely and I can’t remember\nwhen I last laughed. Maybe that’s what she’s counting on. Ruthlessness\nbelongs to the young.” And he frowned into the fire like it was full o’\ndisappointments. “To those who don’t know where it gets you.”\n“So… you’ll make a deal?”\nBlack Calder’s eyes slid across to Clover’s. “Make a deal, with that\nscrag?”\n“So… you won’t make a deal?”\n“I’m tired. I’m not dead.” And he stood up. “Come with me.”\nClover drained his cup, put his hat back on, and followed Black Calder\nout the back of the hall.\nThere was a valley behind the hill, too. That’s how hills and valleys\nwork, after all. Snow on the fields, and the low stone walls, and the gorse\nand sedge on the slopes, and the roofs of the huts and the hovels. This\nvalley wasn’t scattered with men, though. It was crawling with the bastards.\nTents everywhere, dotted all the way down to the half-frozen stream in its\nbottom and up the far side again. Fires and torches like stars in a night sky.\nHe heard laughter, and snatches of song, and the constant clang of hammers\nfrom the many smithies, smoke drifting up in thin streams from their\nchimneys and into the pink evening.\n“By the fucking dead,” whispered Clover, slapped in the face by the\nsight and the cold both at once.\n“Were you thinking that dusting out front was all I could gather?” asked\nCalder. “My son’s mean temper might’ve bruised some feelings but I’ve got\na few friends yet. In the south, down near Ollensand. In the High Valleys,\nup towards Yaws. A fair few men still wandering back from that fucking\ndisaster in Midderland.” He pointed towards the top of the ridge ahead,\nwhere the fires were brightest, and as far as Clover could tell there were\nragged standards poking up against the chilly dusk. “And, thanks to the"

You’re worried over the mess they’ll make, I’d take\nit up with your friend Rikke.”\n“I’ll get the chance?”\n“When we march on Carleon.”\nClover gave a smoky sigh. “I was worried you’d say that.”\n“I was thinking my work was done. Time to put my feet up, leave the\nplotting to the next generation. But you know what? I find I’m rather\npleased to be called on to save the North once more.”\n“Ah. So you’re the hero here, are you?”\n“As a man who’s been cast as both hero and villain, you should know\nbetter’n anyone, Jonas Steepfield—the hero’s whoever wins.” And Calder\nsmiled out at all those fires, the deep lines spreading around the corners of\nhis eyes. “Reckon I’ve a trick or two to teach Tricky Rikke yet. No doubt\nshe’s crafty, but I heard she’s making mistakes. Heard she had a little falling\nout with the Nail.”\n“Aye, well, he’s one o’ those bastards folk start falling out with the\nmoment they meet him. You hear a lot.”\n“It’s just a question of listening.” Calder took a satisfied breath of the\nchill evening air, and let it sigh away. “This was where my father’s dream\nwas born. One North. One nation with one king. My idiot brother’s folly\ncouldn’t stop that dream. My idiot son’s folly won’t, either. The Dogman\ncouldn’t stop it, even with the whole Union at his back. His daughter damn\nsure won’t, Long Eye, Short Eye, or whatever bloody eye.”\n“I should bring my people into the warm,” said Clover. “They’re down\nin the woods at the—”\n“They’re rounded up and disarmed.”\n“Really?”\n“Really.”\n“Huh.” Clover scratched thoughtfully at his scar and resisted the urge to\nask whether they’d live out the day. Calder knew what he was thinking\nanyway.\n“Don’t worry, I’m treating ’em as guests. I’m not my brother or my son.\nI don’t break things I can use. There’s only one question you need to worry\nabout.”\n“Where I go to piss?”\n“Which side you’re on.”\nClover puffed out his cheeks. In all the strutting and waste when Stour\nwas in charge, he’d forgotten what a formidable bastard Black Calder could\nbe. They’re like that, thinkers.

Recklessness, arrogance, trickery, hesitation, bad\nweather, bad allies, bad luck. Or, for instance, that when money was finally\nfound to send the army new boots, Risinau had ordered them supplied with\na collection of his essays instead. Sworbreck had written the foreword. But\ntreason was the only explanation the Court of the People wanted to hear.\n“I did everything I could to win, sir!” bellowed General Bell. “I mean,\nCitizen. You won’t find a more loyal man than me!”\n“Precisely what a traitor would say!” screeched Sworbreck, while\ndrunks in the gallery jeered like the crowd at a slum prizefight.\nLeo had watched them turn Sergeant Bell into General Bell after Judge\nseized power, standing red-faced on the very spot where he now stood trial.\nMade commander of the People’s Army without a day’s experience as an\nofficer. Brint’s jacket had fitted him badly. Brint’s responsibilities fitted him\neven worse. But the Representatives had filled the dome with sentimental\napplause even so.

But since the Great Change, appearances were\nmore important than realities.

His face turned even\nredder than it had at his promotion. “No one had a reason to disrespect him.\nNo one had a bad word for the man!”\n“Admiration!” shrieked Sworbreck. “For one of the most implacable and\nperfidious enemies of the Great Change!

His army was ill-provisioned,\nill-equipped and stuffed with Purity Officers who bastardised every military\ndecision with politics. The surprise was that disaster hadn’t struck sooner.\n“There was no bloody accommodation with the enemy!” shouted Bell.\n“They caught us strung out on the roads, in the rain. My men were\nexhausted. The Purity Officers insisted we march double time!”\n“Always someone else to blame! The Purity Officers now, Burners of\nunimpeachable pedigree, keen to get to grips with the hated enemy!”\n“But the People’s Army have been in the field for weeks. They’ve barely\nbeen paid. Now they’re hardly being fed—”\n“And whose responsibility is it that the army should be prepared, might I\nask, if not the general in charge? Ours, I suppose?” The benches bristled.\nEven Leo grunted denials. You couldn’t give seeds of accusation the chance\nto take root. Before you knew it, suspicion would be sprouting everywhere.\nDisgust rained down on Bell from the public gallery.\n“Poor bastard,” muttered Glaward, with the sympathy of one big,\nlacklustre man for another.\n“I’ve always been loyal.” Bell had tears in his eyes. “Ask anyone I’ve\nserved with.”\nThe chamber fell silent as Judge shifted forwards from her chair, long\nfingers sliding across the table like a cat stretching out to sharpen its claws.\nSworbreck might blather up a hurricane, but everyone knew it was Judge’s\nfew words that counted.\n“It’s true I hear some fine reports o’ your conduct, Bell. It’s how you got\nthe job in the first place. Put yourself in danger to save wounded soldiers.\nGave up meals so others could eat. Walked while sick men rode on your\nhorse. Noble stuff. It’d make me weep in a storybook.” Judge stretched\nfurther, her black eyes fixed on the accused. “But I weep very easily. You\ntold us you did everything you could to win.”\n“I did, Citizeness Judge, please believe—”\n“But you didn’t win.”\nBell blinked, mouth half-open.\n“Can’t say for sure you’re a traitor,” said Judge, “but I know for a fact\nyou’re a loser. And for a general that’s just as bad. Dare I say it’s fucking"

Dare I say it’s fucking\nworse?” She lifted her hammer and smacked the battered table. “Guilty. Get\nhim to the Tower o’ Chains.” Broad caught Bell under the arm and hauled\nhim from the dock.\nLeo dimly remembered a time—a few weeks ago—when there had been\na middle ground. Room for compromises, on some things, some of the time.\nNow everyone was an extremist or a traitor to the cause and any trace of\ndoubt was a betrayal.\n“We need a new general!” someone roared from the back of the benches,\nwhile the old one was still being dragged to his doom.\n“These damned royalists have to be stopped!”\nJurand leaned close. “Now?”\nLeo had to smother a smile. Their thinking was more in step than ever.\n“Let’s test the ground, at least,” he murmured.\n“Citizens!” Jurand sprang to his feet. “Representatives! Officers of the\ncourt! Thanks to foreign intrigues and royalist conspiracies, we have faced\nfrequent defeat in the field.” He’d always been one of the quickest thinkers\nLeo knew, and it had taken him no time at all to learn the language of the\nGreat Change. He made a fine speaker, earnest and believable, with a little\nflush of passionate colour in his cheeks. “Lord Marshal Forest and his\ntraitors should never have been allowed to get the better of the People’s\nArmy. But now our patriots are in disarray. Low on morale. Paralysed by\ncorruption, conspiracy and criminal incompetence.”\nLeo glanced over at Kort and gave him the slightest nod. He rose to roar\nthe piece they’d agreed on. “Only five days ago, a group of farmers on the\ncoast near Keln, banding together against Gurkish invaders, were mistaken\nfor Gurkish invaders themselves and attacked by a group of armed\nfishermen. Twelve men died!” It had actually been one, but nobody got\nexcited over a single corpse any more.\n“What we desperately need is organisation!” called that leader of\nfashion Lord Heugen, now the soberly dressed Citizen Heugen, right on\ncue. “What we must have is tried and tested leadership.”\n“Might I put forward a name known to us all?” asked Jurand, with a\nzealous shake of his fist. “A name already at the tip of many right-thinking\nmen’s tongues when it comes to the defence of the Union. A name\nsynonymous with courage, loyalty and fighting spirit. None other than\nCitizen Brock, the Young Lion!”\nLeo had expected a mixed reaction. The ex-lords and the Anglanders\ncheered, along with Kort and some other representatives Savine had bribed\nhis way. There was scattered applause in the public gallery. He hadn’t lost\nall his charm along with his leg. But there was a low murmur of suspicion,\ntoo. There were shaken heads and sullen glances.\nAnd then there was Judge, considering Leo with the same narrowed eyes\nthat had just considered the ill-fated Bell.

Against the odds. Against countless royalist forces.\nEvery Citizen can see the sacrifices he made on their behalf!”\nThe king’s snort of scorn could’ve been heard in the upper gallery. No\ndoubt he remembered Stoffenbeck differently, and no doubt he wasn’t\nalone, but if these trials were teaching Leo anything, it’s that what really\nhappened doesn’t matter half so much as what people want to hear. He\ncaught Glaward’s shoulder and dragged himself to his feet, took his cane\nfrom Jurand and lurched out onto the tiles as the hall fell silent.\n“Citizens!” he called. “Citizenesses! I gave up the ‘dan’ in my name.\nGave it up happily, right on this spot. I gave up my Lord Governorship, my\nbirthright, because I believe in what we’re doing here. Because I believe in\nthe Great Change!”\nHe waved down shouts of support from those Representatives he’d\npersuaded to shout support. “Still! It’s true I was a nobleman. And the Army\nof the People should be led by a man of the people.” Just as Sergeant Bell\nhad been, when they buttoned him into General Brint’s ill-fitting uniform\nand sent him off, armed with essays, to lose to the royalists. “I regret I\ncannot take up this honour.”\nKing Orso gave another great snort, but it was soon lost in the applause\nat his selflessness and sacrifice. Perhaps he’d convinced some of the\ndoubters to cheer. Even Judge gave him a cool nod as he dropped back onto\nthe benches.\n“You turn it down?” whispered Glaward.\n“Better to turn it down before they refuse to offer it,” murmured Jurand,\nlips carefully pursed as he gauged the feeling in the galleries. “Then we can\ntake it up later.”\n“We need a patriot!” someone was shouting.\n“Enough bloody generals! Enough bloody experts!”\n“We need someone who truly believes!”\nLeo adjusted his useless arm in his jacket. Belief won’t stop a cannon-\nstone. He could’ve told them that.\nCharity\nS\nnow fell weighty on the slums. Wisps and flutters, dirty from the smoke\nof the furnaces, drifting grey into the corners of the windows, the doorways,\nthe alleys.\nThe Burners’ slogans were everywhere, daubed in red paint across the\nhouses. All Equal and Death to the Royalists and Sacrifice Everything. The\nfury of Sworbreck and his ilk at the world and everything in it had spread\nlike a sickness from books, to newsbills, to pamphlets, until the poorly\nprinted tantrums were pasted everywhere directly onto the sooty walls,\ntoday’s rant against those who would drag the Union back into the past\nsplattered on top of yesterday’s, torn paper fluttering.\nA snatch of song floated across the frozen street.

A man staggered by,\nsucking at a bottle. Someone screamed with laughter from an upstairs\nwindow and Savine flinched. Laughing in Adua these days felt as grimly\ninappropriate as laughing at a funeral. At an execution.\n“I hope you are well, Citizen Vallimir.”\n“I am alive, Citizeness Brock, and my wife is alive, which, after the\nevents we endured in Valbeck, I consider to be remarkable good fortune.”\n“Your fortunes otherwise?” She could see those at a glance. Vallimir had\nalways been lean, but he looked positively skeletal now, frayed clothes\ncarefully darned. “I still fondly remember that jelly you served at your\nhouse in Valbeck.”\nVallimir snorted. “There have been no jellies lately. I was employed as a\nforeman in a textile mill for a while, but following the Great Change… the\nprice of coal… the place shut down. My wife takes in laundry. I have been\ncarving toys. Soldiers are always popular.” He leaned close to murmur,\n“Providing they sport no royalist symbols.”\n“These are difficult times for everyone.”\nThere were hawkers everywhere, struggling to turn a few bits from\nmatches, ribbons, apples, shoestrings. Beggars, too, offering up their\nwounds, their diseases, their misery for inspection, knowing that despite the\npoverty, people here were more generous than in the richer parts of town.\nPeople here understood what it was to have nothing. Most of them were\nonly one payday away from it.\nProstitutes stood shivering on a corner in the same tall shoes and slit\nskirts they had worn when King Jezal was on the throne. The Great Change\nhad not changed much for them. It took a brave woman now to show a bare\nleg to the freezing winter, but they tried their best, pale gooseflesh and\npinched faces chapped pink from the cold, breath smoking as they whined\nhopeless come-ons to the uncaring chill. Then there were the footpads and\ntricksters, circling anyone who looked as if they might have a coin. There\nhad been a time when Savine counted on her father’s name to keep her safe\non these streets. Now she never stepped out of doors without Haroon and a\nfew well-armed men.\n“You know I have the highest regard for you as a woman of business.”\nVallimir cleared his throat. His voice had an ill crackle to it. “But prominent\nconnections are not the safest thing these days. Might I ask why you sent\nfor me?”\n“In Valbeck you helped me make money. Now… I want you to help me\ngive it away.”\nThey had reached the back of the queue. Dozens of lumpen figures\ncrowded along one side of the street, bound up into shapeless bundles of\ntorn clothes, blankets, rags. They stamped at the snow to keep warm,\nhugged themselves, hugged each other. Further on, someone sawed at a\nviolin while a woman danced. Danced well. Children pelted each other with\nsnowballs. Caught bystanders. There was laughter. Clapping. A cheerful\nfeeling all too rare in the city now."

A cheerful\nfeeling all too rare in the city now.\n“What are they queueing for?”\nSavine sighed. She still was faintly embarrassed to utter the words. “My\ncharity, Citizen Vallimir.” She gestured towards a tin chimney peering over\nthe roofline, dark smoke billowing up as the pale specks swirled down. “I\nown six bakeries now in the borough and have agents scouring Midderland\nfor flour. Soup is made from whatever we can find. Thread is brought from\nValbeck and the blankets woven just up the street. Coal comes in from my\nmines in Angland through an agreement with Lady Governor Finree. I was\nusing the canal I own with Dietam Kort to move goods, until it froze.”\nEverything in the city had frozen. The water in the fountains. The river\naround the boats. Festoons of ice hung from broken gutters. In some of the\ncheaper taverns, she understood, the wine was known to freeze in the cups.\n“When I first tried to give bread away it turned into a riot. One of the\nwagons was upended. People wrestled in the mud for crumbs. People who\ngot away with what I had given them were robbed in the next street. I\nobserved the whole sorry business pressed into a doorway while my\ncompanion’s brothers shielded me with their bodies.”\n“It is not like you to show too much faith in people’s good nature.”\nWho knew generosity could be more dangerous than greed? “A mistake\nI will not make again. Ever since then I have been applying the same rigour\nto giving my money away as I did to making it.” They crunched through the\nboot-mashed snow to the front of the queue, where it passed through the\niron gates into the warehouse. “Real estate in these parts has plummeted. I\nbought this place for a price you would not believe.” She had bought half\nthe decaying buildings in the neighbourhood, in fact, and slashed the rents.\n“I saw the roof mended and invested in guards and gates. I hired locals to\ndrive wagons, handle goods, stoke ovens, knead dough. I distributed some\ncarefully judged bribes among the local Burners, secured some help from\nan old contact in the criminal fraternity and made sure she kept order on the\nstreets.”\nShe waved towards one of the braziers, a matching pair of Majir’s\nfrowning thugs in attendance. “The people queue, hopefully without\nfreezing. They receive a bag of coal, two loaves of bread, a blanket. There\nmight be meat or milk for children, on a good day. Names and addresses are\ntaken, marks and signatures given to discourage fraud. But sometimes\nexamples have to be made even so.”\nVallimir raised a brow at her, and she shrugged. “It is not like me to\nshow too much faith in people’s good nature. These days we have fewer\ndisruptions.”\n“Charity on an industrial scale,” murmured Vallimir. “You were never\none for half-measures.”\n“No. I mean to set up a similar operation across the river and need to\nleave the management of this one in capable hands.”\n“Mine?”"

I have no doubt I could\nmake use of your wife’s talents as well. My parents’ house is currently filled\nwith orphaned children. The work has no end…” She trailed off into\nawkward silence.\nVallimir was studying her with a healthy degree of suspicion. “I read\nthat pamphlet, you know.”\nThe pamphlets that circulated under the old regime had been bad\nenough. Some of the ones that circulated now went far beyond slander into\nthe realm of sordid fantasy.\n“I hardly dare to ask which one,” said Savine, already feeling pinched\nby the cold.\nVallimir took out a paper, creased and faded. The Darling of the Slums.\nAnd there was that etching of a radiantly smiling Savine dan Brock\ndispensing coins to the starving while orphans clutched at her skirts. The\nsight of it made Savine feel faintly nauseous.\n“What did you think?”\n“I could not avoid the conclusion that you were a damned liar.”\nSavine gave a brittle smile. “I would not dream of denying it.”\n“So I am forced to ask… what is the angle?” Understandable, of course,\ngiven he had known her before Stoffenbeck. Before Valbeck. Hard to\nbelieve it was only a year and a half ago. Savine dan Glokta seemed a faint\nacquaintance, dimly remembered, and not with much affection. “Is there\nsome profit hidden in all this?”\nSavine thought of Zuri shaking her head over the numbers in the book.\n“Not of the financial kind, certainly.”\n“Goodwill, then? Popularity?”\n“We could all use a little goodwill in these troubled times, but I daresay\nI could polish my image for a fraction of what I am spending here.”\n“So why…” Vallimir waved towards a woman waddling from the\nwarehouse gates with a bag of coal, the bulge of pregnancy showing even\nthrough her mass of clothes, three children of decreasing height waddling\nafter her like ducklings after their mother, the one at the back with a loaf in\nhis pink hand and two glistening streaks of snot down his face. “All this?”\nWhy indeed? Savine took a deep breath, the cold of it almost painful,\nand gazed into the flames in the brazier. “It is, as you have no doubt\nguessed, entirely selfish. The truth is… the past seems to be a scab I cannot\nstop picking. I often think about Valbeck. About the uprising, and what I did\nthere… and what I did before. About the children we used in our mill. The\nchildren… I made you use.” The fire, the queue, the snowy street, it had all\nbecome a sparkling blur, her eyes focused beyond. “I think about the\nbattlefield at Stoffenbeck, too. The graves there. You would hardly\nbelieve… the size of the graves. The truth is… I wonder if the Great\nChange has really made things worse, or if it simply made them worse for\nme. Are there more beggars now, or do I simply see them for the first time?"

Are there more beggars now, or do I simply see them for the first time?\nWas I any better than Judge, when I held the power? Was I worse? The truth\nis… I jerk awake, in the night, sure the Burners have come for me at last,\nand I know… that I deserve it.”\nSavine cleared her throat and wiped her stinging lower eyelids carefully\nwith one gloved fingertip. “I have started thinking it might be a fine thing…\nif the world was a better place for my existence.” Curnsbick had always\ntold her she had a generous heart, and she had thought him a sentimental\nfool. Perhaps it had simply been hidden under all the pearl dust and\nambition. Hidden even from her. “I find… I feel a little lighter for every\nmark I give away. That… is the angle.”\nShe tore her eyes from the queue and found her one-time business\npartner staring at her, pamphlet still in his hand, almost as surprised by that\nunguarded moment as she was.\n“By all means you can give me the lecture now,” she snapped. “You will\ntell me nothing I have not told myself. That this is a feeble sponge to soak\nup the rivers of misery I spilled for my own profit. That this is the pinnacle\nof soppy hypocrisy. A woman who made slaves of children, handing out a\nfew lumps of coal as though it makes her a heroine.”\nVallimir paused, mouth slightly open, perhaps trapped between denying\nit out of politeness or agreeing with the obvious truth. Then he turned to the\nqueue, tucking The Darling of the Slums back in his coat pocket, and blew\nout a smoky sigh. “I suppose… it’s better to give it away than to keep it.”\nAnd they stood together as the snow came down, and watched the loaves\nbeing given away.\n“They tossed General Bell from the Tower of Chains,” called Leo. A\nmoment later, Savine heard the clonk of his leg tossed onto the floor as he\ndropped back against his pillows.\nShe winced. Not just at the thought of the execution, but at the offhand\nway he spoke of it. “I heard.”\n“Jurand told the court they should give me his position.”\nShe stepped into the bedroom, staring over at him, sprawled on the bed\nin the light of one candle. “You want it?”\n“Not yet. When the time’s right.” He looked surprised that she was\nsurprised, even though they had been throwing generals off the Tower of\nChains almost as fast as they had bankers. “Command of the People’s\nArmy, Savine. I could sway them my way. They’re in a wretched state,\nthough, I hear. No food, no equipment, no morale.”\n“We could send them blankets. Winter coats for the officers. Bread,\nmaybe.” She still was not used to the shape his body made, under the\ncovers. The one leg, the strange absence of the other. Like some fairground\ntrick. It was a struggle not to stare. “Make sure they know it all comes from\nthe Young Lion. To one set of heroes from another.”\nThe gap in Leo’s teeth showed as he grinned. “You always know the\nright gloss to put on things.”"

She looked at the floor, wondering how she could possibly put\nany gloss on what she had to say. “There is something… I need to share\nwith you. Something I found out shortly before we were married.”\nHe narrowed his eyes slightly. “Why didn’t you tell me then?” He had\nchanged. Before Stoffenbeck it would never have occurred to him to ask.\n“I should have. But I never thought you would find out. I never thought\nanyone would.”\nHe narrowed his eyes further. The look of a wary customer who suspects\nhe is being palmed off with inferior goods. “But someone has?”\n“It seems so. And they might make it known to others.” She swallowed.\nEvery word felt like a weight to lift. “Secrets, in my experience, rarely stay\nburied.”\n“So you judged it was better to tell me now than risk me finding out for\nmyself. Excellent strategy. I’d expect nothing less.”\n“Please, Leo.”\n“What kind of secret worries you?”\nThe disgusting and potentially lethal kind. She clenched her fists. Forced\nout the words. “King Orso… and I…”\nLeo waved her away. “Selest dan bloody Heugen told me you were\nlovers, remember?”\n“Not that.” Well, yes, that, but so much more than that. It still shocked\nher to say it. Still repelled her to think it. She squeezed her eyes shut, her\nears full of the sound of blood surging, and blurted it in a rush. “We have\nthe same father!”\nSilence. When she opened her eyes, Leo was frowning at her. Puzzled.\nAs though he must have misheard. “Wait…”\n“King Jezal and my mother were lovers! Long ago. Before he was king,\neven. And I was the result.”\n“Orso’s your brother?” whispered Leo.\nShe grimaced. “Yes.”\n“That’s why he didn’t hang me.”\n“Maybe. Part of it.”\nLeo sat back, frowning at the ceiling. “So… my wife…”\nShe closed her eyes again, face burning. “Yes.”\n“Is King Jezal’s oldest child?”\n“What?” That she had enthusiastically practised incest did not seem to\nhave occurred to him. Or, if it did, there were aspects of the case that\ninterested him far more.\n“Our children… are King Jezal’s grandchildren. By the dead, Savine,\nour children might be next in line to the throne!”\nIt was not fear in his voice, or disgust. It was excitement. Somehow that\nworried her even more.\n“But, don’t you see…” She sat on the bed, nervously clutching up a\nhandful of the quilt. “The danger this puts us in, puts them in—”\n“Of course.” He clasped her hand, eyes gleaming in the candlelight.\n“But danger and opportunity often walk hand in hand.”\nSavine stared. “My father used to say that.”\n“Which one?

That mixture of cunning, ruthlessness, burning ambition and\nconstant pain was far from unfamiliar.\nShe had heard it said that every woman ends up marrying her father.\nUntil that moment, she had always imagined herself the exception.\nThe Good Work\nT\nhe setting sun was a great fiery smear around the Tower of Chains,\nthrough the wintry haze and the furnace smoke, over the broken teeth of the\nAgriont’s part-ruined walls. They’d given up on taking ’em down, more or\nless. Another job left quarter-done, like most things since the Great Change.\nMost things but murder, anyway.\nThe Square of Marshals had become the Square of Martyrs—the sea of\nflagstones chiselled with the names of Breakers and Burners killed in\ntwenty years of Old Sticks’ purges. Hammers tap, tap, tapped away all day\nas they added more. Hundreds of them. Thousands.\nThere were fewer folk come out to watch the executions than when\nJudge first took charge. Maybe they were tiring of the blood. No doubt they\nwere tiring of the cold. Bitter chill out here. Clouds of smoky breath as the\nangriest ones screeched insults at the accused.\nBroad could hardly see the point of screaming at folk already good as\ndead. But he was what you’d have to call blind drunk. Spent most of his\nwaking hours blind drunk, now. Like he had in Styria. The only way he\ncould see to get through it.\nIt was society in miniature, in the Square of Martyrs. Every type of\nperson and every type who preyed on ’em. You’d have thought the\naristocrats and the bureaucrats would’ve stayed well away, but they were\nhere, too, with red ribbons in the ex-ladies’ hair and red stains on the ex-\nlords’ clothes, howling their hate at the convicted louder’n anyone, as if that\nmight save them from being next.\nThey’d brought carts into the Agriont and opened ’em up to make\nimprovised souvenir shops, jerry tents, food stalls. Some enterprising\nbastard had turned a guardhouse into a pawn shop, so you could sell your\nwatch for a quarter of what it was worth and go straight upstairs to where\nthey’d turned some administrator’s office into a brothel, the bookcases\npushed over to make bawdy stages, the desks made into beds, the easy\nchairs into husk-dens. Enterprise always finds a way.\nBroad gave the closest prisoner a little nudge in the back, just to keep\nhim moving. Didn’t say anything.

Here’s a triple! Sarlby would say. He was leading\nthe way, flatbow under his arm. Jaunty, almost, how he strutted across the\nsquare, across those dead men’s names. Used to be a good man, Sarlby.\nThere was a piece of him missing, these days. He had no doubts.\nSometimes felt like all Broad had was doubts. But they changed nothing.\nHe took another nip. The more he drank, the harder it was to keep count.\nThe more he drank, the less he cared about innocence or guilt. The more he\ndrank, the less their crying bothered him. Their arguing. Their endless\nfucking reasoning. A cuff across the head would shut ’em up, when it got\ntoo much. It’d been the same with the prisoners in Styria. No food to spare\nfor the enemy, so… get Gunnar Broad. He’ll do what needs doing.\nAnd he did. The families gathered here, in the cold shadow of the Tower\nof Chains, to say their last goodbyes. To hope for some nick-of-time\nreprieve that would never come. There was a woman bundled up in a\nblanket, her face all pink and raw from cold, eyes shining with tears. She\nblundered out and caught the prisoner closest to Broad.\nThey clasped each other. Whispered something to each other, foreheads\npressed together. Broad wondered what he’d have done, if that was him and\nLiddy. Him and May. Maybe he’d find out, one day soon. If there was any\njustice.\nHe drank again, spirits burning his sore gullet. It was like taking the\nlenses off his mind. Made everything a blur. So he didn’t have to see\nLiddy’s face, or May’s. Didn’t have to think of what they’d say. Didn’t have\nto put ’em next to what he was now. Didn’t have to fear what he might do to\n’em. Made it easier, being drunk. Or did it make it easier to have something\nto blame? I was drunk, so I wasn’t thinking straight. I was drunk, so I\ncouldn’t help myself. I was drunk, so it wasn’t really me, even though,\nwhen he was drunk, it was really him even more than when he was sober. It\nwas never really him until he was drunk.\nTruth be told, he was a man who broke everything. He’d been running\nfrom it ever since Styria, and all he’d done was run straight into it again.\nTold himself it was the safest thing for Liddy and May to stay in Angland,\nand for him to stay here. Told himself he was doing it for their sakes."

That he was doing it for his own.\nThey clung to each other with desperate strength, these two, trying\nsomehow to put off that final parting. Broad had the pain of sentimental\ntears at the back of his nose as he prised them apart, hands numb from the\ncold, numb from the drink. But he still did it.\n“I love you!” the woman called as one of the other Burners pulled her\naway and Broad pushed her man on towards the Tower of Chains. I love\nyou. Like her love might be a cushion he could bounce on when he hit the\nfrozen ground.\nOver the anger of the crowd, faint from beyond the Agriont’s broken\nwalls, he could hear the dogs. A different kind of bloodthirsty. There were\npacks of ’em in the streets now. Turned almost as feral as the people.\nWolves and foxes, too, drawn out of the cold countryside and into the city\nby some glimpse of fire, some whiff of blood. They slipped through the\ncrowds outside the Agriont, darted up to lap at the half-frozen spatter at the\nbase of the tower.\nBroad pulled his lenses off to rub at the bridge of his nose with a shaky\nhand, but even without them he could smell it. Even in the cold you could\nsmell it from streets away now, the place of execution. The place where the\nfall passed its final judgement.\nDidn’t even shock him any more. Part of his workday, like scrubbing out\nthe tubs at the brewery in Valbeck. The unspeakable made commonplace.\nThey handed the prisoners over to the Burners at the foot of the tower.\nHerded them onto Curnsbick’s new lift. A wonder of the modern age. The\nsignal was given, the machinery clattered into life and the platform lurched\nupwards. The climb had almost been kinder.\nThe families sobbed and wailed, blew kisses and streamed with tears, a\nforest of reaching hands. Wives and husbands, parents and children. The\ncondemned tried to stay strong. The same wearying pattern as ever.\nBroad turned his back on it. Trudged across the frosty stones towards the\nCourt of the People. Sarlby was whistling a tune. All the faces they passed\nwere tilted up now, the light of torches flickering on their expectant grins,\nthe sunset glimmering in their eager eyes as they waited for the little specks\nto start falling and knew, for certain, the joy of being the ones still alive.\nHe took another nip. Easier when you were drunk, so he kept drinking.\nHelps to have a routine. Innocence and guilt had made no difference in\nStyria and they made none here. No one was guiltier’n him, were they? But\nhe wasn’t the one falling, he was the one doing the pushing.\nAll that mattered was what Judge said. That was all the folk on the\nbenches cared about, the folk in the galleries cared about. Guilty, guilty,\nguilty. How could Broad say different? He wasn’t special. Since the Great\nChange, being special was not a good idea."

That he did want to do it, ’cause there was a pit\nof rage in him there was never any filling. He’d rather tell himself he hated\nJudge than admit he was just like her.\nHe looked up the trash-scattered steps to the Court of the People. “I’ll\ngive Judge the report,” he said.\n“Oh, aye, you wouldn’t want to miss that.” Sparks was grinning at him.\nThe man liked to taunt him. Maybe ’cause of the beating Broad had given\nhim in Valbeck that time. Some men never learn their lesson.\n“Meaning?” he asked.\n“Meaning she’s got quite an itch for you, and what Judge likes she tends\nto get.”\n“Leave it be,” grunted Sarlby. “Broad’s a good family man.”\n“Perfect!” Sparks’s grin had become a leer, and he did a few thrusts of\nhis hips in case anyone was still struggling to find the point. “While one\nfamily’s up in Angland you can start another here—”\nBroad caught Sparks by the collar and smashed his fist into his face.\nThen he hauled him over a plinth some statue had been broken off from, so\nhis neck was over the edge of the block, stuck the heel of his hand on the\nside of his jaw and started to push.\nSparks plucked helplessly at Broad’s wrists, clawed at his red-smeared\nbreastplate with his fingernails, made this hissing, squealing groan, eyes\nbulging as his skull was twisted further and further around.\n“I should pop your fucking head off,” said Broad. Not some wild,\nhissing threat. Just a dull observation. Bored, almost.\n“Come on, Bull,” said Sarlby. “He’s a fucking idiot, aye, but if that’s a\ncrime we’ll all be for the drop, eh?”\nBroad let go, and Sparks tumbled off the plinth and knelt, blowing\nbloody bubbles from his nose, clutching at his neck.\n“We are all for the drop,” said Broad, and he stomped up the steps of the\ncourt. Told himself he’d lost control a moment. Stopped himself before he\ndid something he’d regret. That was better’n the alternative. That he’d\nloved every moment of it and would’ve regretted nothing if he’d snapped\nSparks’s neck apart.\nCourt was over, the galleries emptied, the last few Representatives\nmaking their way through the foyer, where the marble walls were smeared\nwith streaked slogans, red paint turned black by candlelight. Broad\nshouldered through ’em, glaring. He was in a fighting mood. He always\nwas.\nBannerman was standing guard in the anteroom, sneer on his face and\nred paint all up his sleeves.

Why\nhold a thug to a higher standard?\nBroad thought about punching him in the face. But then he thought\nabout that with everyone now, more or less. They didn’t speak to each other.\nDidn’t acknowledge each other. What was there to say?\n“Bastard,” Broad muttered to himself, then nearly tripped over his own\nfeet. Damn, he was drunk, but damn, he wasn’t drunk enough. It was sixty-\nfive since dawn. In case anyone was asking. They’d done twenty just after\nsunup who’d been convicted last night, in the dark. He pulled his lenses off,\nsqueezed at the bridge of his nose. Squeezed it so hard it hurt. At least in\nStyria there’d been an enemy. Now the enemy was all around. The enemy\nwas everyone. The enemy was yourself.\n“Hard day.” Judge sat in her chair, the chair Risinau once sat in, the\nchair the king once sat in, the chair she gave the judgements from, passed\nthe sentences from, one bare foot up on the hammer-battered table. She’d a\nhusk-pipe in her hand, and she took a long pull from it and blew out a great\nplume of sweet-smelling smoke that tickled at the back of Broad’s throat,\nmade him want to cough, made him want to puke, made him want to rip at\nhis face with his nails. She let her head drop back, long, thin throat\nstretched out, and he could swear he saw the thick veins pulsing.\n“You’re hurting,” she said, looking at him sidelong.\n“I’m all right.” Had he said that? Didn’t sound like something he’d say.\nHe was about as far from all right as could be. Even further from it than\nhe’d been in Styria. He’d promised no more trouble. But if life had taught\nhim one thing, it was that he was shit at keeping promises.\n“Sixty-five today,” his mouth burbled out.\n“We’ll do better tomorrow.”\nWhen she said better, did she mean they’d kill fewer? He’d a horrible\nfeeling she meant they’d kill more.\nHe had the pipe. Hardly remembered taking it, but he had it. Sucked on\nit hard as he could, deep as he could, till it filled his lungs and his head, and\nwhen he blew out, everything turned numb.\n“It’s not easy.” said Judge. “Believe me, I know it’s not easy.” She was\nacross the table. Had she slid under it like a snake? Or had he climbed over\nit? “But if the good work was easy, it would’ve been done long ago.”\nSeemed like her black eyes saw right through him. Saw his guilt and his\nhorror and his black memories. No doubt in her eyes. Just the fire. Just the\ncertainty, brighter’n ever.

Someone has to\nbury their feelings and sentence the past to death.” He felt her hand, pressed\nlight against his breastplate. “And someone has to carry out the sentence.\nNot ’cause we want to. But ’cause it has to be done, and we’re fitted for the\ntask…”\nThey were alone in that vast space, alone with the empty benches, and\nthe empty galleries, and the empty slogans, echoes of their whispers\nwhispering back at them from the darkness.\n“We won’t be thanked. We won’t be forgiven. Not by anyone. Least of\nall ourselves…”\nHe could kill her now. Catch her thin, rash-speckled throat and choke\nthe life from it. Smash her head against the table, spray her blood across the\ntiles, easy as crushing a beetle. He could put an end to this madness.\nBut all he did was stand there. He told himself he was a coward. That\nwas better’n the alternative. That there was something in her he couldn’t\nresist. Something he wanted like a drunk wants the bottle, knowing it’s bad\nfor him, bad for everyone, but knowing he can’t stop himself.\n“We have to bear the weight of it,” she whispered. “For those whose\nnames are carved in the stone outside. For those who gave everything they\nhad. For those who’ll come after us…”\nShe narrowed her eyes, and reached up for him, and he stood there dumb\nand drunk as she pulled the lenses off his nose, so the Court of the People\nbecame nothing but dots of haloed light in a great blurred, husk-smelling\ndarkness.\n“Can’t see a fucking thing,” he muttered.\n“Maybe it’s better that way,” she whispered, breath hot on his face and\nsmelling like spirits. “Maybe it’s time to let go.”\nShe grabbed him. Or did he grab her? They were kissing, anyway, if you\ncould even call it kissing. Too hard, too violent, too painful for that.\nGrowling and biting. Like they were eating each other.\nHe tried to fling her away. Or did he pull her closer? Clutching at her.\nTearing at her already-torn clothes, his fists tangled in the tatters of her\nruined old dress and his nose full of the sour smoke smell of her. Wanted\nher more than he’d ever wanted anyone. Hated her more than he’d ever\nhated anyone. Except himself, maybe.\nHe had her by the dozen chains around her neck, and she had him by his\nbelt with one hand, dragging it open, the other clawing at his face, hard, at\nhis jaw, merciless, her thumb was inside his cheek, pulling his head down\ntowards her, pulling him down on top of her. He wanted her to hurt him.\nHer bare feet around the back of his bare arse, stuck tight to him, and he\nripped her torn skirts up over the tattooed treatise on her thigh, dragging his\nface close to hers, close enough that he could see the fire reflected in her\neyes."

At least to begin with.\nBut that doesn’t mean you’re not doing it.\nThe World a Camp\nT\nhe procession wended from the gloom of falling snow. The Burners\nwalked ten abreast in their paint-spattered clothes, their red-speckled\narmour, each of them holding high a torch, light falling hard on their hollow\nfaces. Everyone else had to scrape out of their way, press themselves to the\nbuildings and the doorways. Even Vick and her Constables and their\nprisoners.\nNow came the coffin, borne on the shoulders of eight women looking\nmighty cold in white dresses slush-stained around the hems. There was an\nantique feel to it all, as if the funeral procession of great Juvens had\nmarched from the pages of the storybooks for this one moment.\n“Who’s in the casket?” grunted Vick.\n“Some Burner. Led the revolt in Keln, I heard.” Tallow glanced about,\nthen leaned close to whisper, “They say he was killed by royalists, but he\nwas a moderate.”\n“Meaning what?” Extreme last week was moderate now. By next week\nit would have become collaboration.\n“The rumour is Judge done away with him. They say she’s drunk on\nblood. Gone mad with it.”\n“To go mad you have to be sane to begin with.” Vick watched the\nshuffling column fade into the snow, off towards the Mausoleum of\nthe Great Change, not even half-built beside the Four Corners, where the\nheroes of the Breakers and Burners were being laid to rest. “Let’s move!”\nshe called, trudging on through the slush and the crowds and the frosty cold,\npast a great heap of burning books, pages occasionally floating on fire into\nthe night, and down the echoing entrance tunnel of the Agriont.\nOn the street that was once the Kingsway the statues had been replaced.\nOr, at least, their faces, their hands, their clothes had. Clumsy alterations\nhad turned them from centuries of kings and their advisors into miners,\nbuilders, farmers, nursing mothers. Heroes of the common folk. Risinau’s\nplans, cheaply realised, awkwardly posed, something pained and accusatory\nin their clumsily carved expressions.\n“Bloody hell it’s cold.” Tallow hugged himself, blathering steam into the\nearly darkness. “My sister’s got ice on the inside of her window. She spends\nhalf her time queueing. For coal, for bread, for meat. When she gets to the\nend, often as not they’ve run out.

They were trying groups of a dozen now, till dusk and beyond,\nthose with evidence against them and those with none mixed together as if\ntheir cases were all connected, so the guilt of one would splatter the rest and\nthey all could be dragged down, like swimmers chained together. The only\nfolk who got acquitted these days were those who denounced freely. Those\nwho denounced anyone and everyone. Denounced their lovers, their\nparents, their children.\nThe House of Purity was overflowing with bankers and clerks. Traitors\nagainst the Great Change, suspected of aristocratic plots, foreign\nconspiracies, royalist schemes, arrested by the Burners and awaiting trial,\nhad to be squeezed in elsewhere. They’d made the Fortress of the Knights\nHerald into a prison, then the walled treasury buildings. Families traipsed\nthe courtyards, begging to know where their loved ones were being held,\ngathered in the snow outside the windows with children on their shoulders\nfor a glimpse of daddy.\n“I hear they’re setting up new courts,” said Tallow.\n“I guess Judge can’t pronounce the death sentences fast enough on her\nown.”\n“Aiming at one in each district of Adua.”\n“In each district?”\n“And each town in Midderland. Three in Keln. Two in Valbeck. They\nsay they’ll have to set up more when Forest and his royalists are finally\nbrought to justice. They’re appointing new magistrates to hear all the cases.\nI hear they’re paid by the conviction.”\n“Fuck,” whispered Vick.\n“New places of execution, too.”\n“I guess they’ll need them.”\n“They tried to use the bell tower on the old Spicers’ guildhall, but, well,\nit wasn’t high enough.”\nVick winced. “Fuck.”\n“They didn’t all die right off. Had to have a Burner at the bottom with a\npickaxe to finish the poor bastards—”\n“All right, Tallow, I get the picture.” It was coming to something when a\nchild of the prison camps was finding life in the capital too dark for\ncomfort.\nHer mind wandered back there. To the camps. To her own father,\ncoughing blood in that cold winter. She’d tried to trade for a blanket, work\nfor an empty sack, steal a little knuckle of coal, but it was never enough.\nHer mother, wasted away to nothing. So thin at the end you could see her\nbones. Her sister’s screams behind her in the mine as the floodwater rushed\ninto the tunnel.\nVick came to a stop in the snow, watching the Constables herding her\nlatest batch of prisoners across the Square of Martyrs.\n“I’d hoped it might get better,” she muttered. “But it’s getting worse.”\nTallow hopped from one foot to the other for warmth. “You could’ve\nsaid that any time since I met you.”\n“That’s your comfort?

Judge answers to no one but the fire. She won’t be happy till she’s\nburned it all to the ground.”\n“Not even then, I daresay.” Tallow glanced towards another sorry set of\nthe accused being driven hunched through the snow. “But you might want\nto keep your voice down.”\n“This was meant to set us all free. Instead we’ve turned the whole\nAgriont into a prison.” Vick frowned at the names cut into the stones under\nher feet, half-seen through the slush. She wondered if Sibalt’s was there,\nsomewhere. She remembered lying in his narrow bed, talking about how\nthey’d change the world. She’d known they were dreams. But they’d been\npretty dreams, at least. Was this the better world he’d died for? “We’ve\nmade the whole city into a camp. The whole Union.”\n“You always say we should stand with the winners…”\nOne of the prisoners broke from the line, chains on her ankles clanking,\nrag-wrapped hands clutching. Vick was ready to punch her. Almost did it.\nBut all she wanted was to push something into Vick’s hands. A folded\npaper.\n“You’ve a kind face! Take this to my daughter, please.”\n“Come here,” grunted one of the Burners, grabbing her under the arm\nwithout malice, without gentleness. The way a shepherd grabs a sheep.\n“Sorry ’bout that, Inspector.”\n“Please!” the woman blubbed as he dragged her away.\nVick knew she had nothing close to a kind face. A bag of chisels was\nhow she’d always thought of what she saw in the mirror. She’d been given\nthe letter, not Tallow or someone softer, because she looked like someone\nwho got things done. She unfolded it, fingers cold and sluggish even in her\ngloves.\n“What does it say?” asked Tallow.\nThere was no poetry to it. Scrawled on a scrap of candle-wrapper with a\nstub of charcoal from a dead fire. Just love, and best wishes, and keep\ngoing, and don’t forget me. She realised she’d no idea who to take it to. No\nidea who the woman had been. Could’ve been anyone. Could almost have\nbeen Vick herself. Except she had no one to write a letter to.\n“It says goodbye.” She crumpled the paper in her fist. “Get the prisoners\nwhere they’re going.” And she turned and strode off, back the way they’d\ncome, boots crunching in her own footprints, already turning dirty white\nwith new snow.\nSeemed the Great Change had been almost as tough on Styrian spies as on\neveryone else. The warren of gloomy cellars under the sign of the fish-\nwoman reminded Vick more of the mines of Angland than ever. Not only\nwas it underground but freezing, too, puddles of icy meltwater from the\nstreets above gathered in the corners.\nThere was no music. No dancers. Few patrons of any kind. The barman\nstood where he had on her last visit, the same magnificent array of\nglassware behind him, but a lot of the bottles were down to dribbles."

Sometimes we need comfort.”\n“Do I look that bad?”\n“You look far better than most in Adua.”\nShe drank again. “That bad. I don’t suppose our mutual friend in Talins,\nthe woman with all the whispers, might be tempted to intercede in affairs on\nthis side of the Circle Sea? Help put an end to this… chaos? Get the liquor\nflowing again?”\nThe barman gave a sad smile. “I wouldn’t demean us both by making\nsuch a suggestion to our mutual friend. Her mistress, lest we forget, is far\nfrom the most open-handed of rulers at the best of times, and positively\ndelights in chaos on this side of the Circle Sea. I hear the news makes her\ngiggle daily over breakfast.”\n“Didn’t have the Serpent of Talins down as a giggler.”\n“No one did till now.”\nVick pushed her empty glass at him. Like most drinks, it got better with\ntime. “A little optimistic of me, I’ll admit. If not to say desperate.”\nHe poured her another. “There is no place for either optimism or\ndesperation in our business.”\nVick raised her glass. “To pessimism and hard heads.”\n“I can drink to that.” And he slipped another glass onto the bar. “The\nUnion, I fear, is beyond help. This Great Change is a fever that has to burn\nitself out. But you always struck me as a woman who’d save herself.” She\nstopped sipping to watch him over the rim of her glass. “If you decided\nAdua no longer held any charms…” He glanced up and down the vaulted\ncellar. “Which would be thoroughly understandable… I expect our mutual\nfriend would still welcome you with open arms.”\n“Spring in Talins, eh?”\n“The weather alone would be worth the trip. The time comes…” And he\nswallowed his shot in one and slapped the empty glass down on the bar.\n“You have to get out.”\nShe slowly nodded. Wouldn’t be the first time she’d got out. Saved"

But then it was cold everywhere. He\ntook perverse pleasure in tolerating the same conditions his least fortunate\nsubjects must be enduring.

In cold water, of course,\nsince that was all that could be had. Now she was pegging it up to dry near\nthe bars.

I have your welfare in mind.”\n“No one laughs where you’re going.”\n“What does that mean?” asked Hildi, frowning at him.\n“His Majesty has been sent for.” And Halder pulled the barred door\nopen.\n“Oh, damn.” Orso draped himself as nonchalantly as he could against\nthe damp pillar in the middle of the cellar. “Must I really leave my suite?”\n“’Fraid so.”\n“Have the chef prepare my morning repast for my return, Hildi.” And he\nflounced from the cell. He knew how much his attendants hated it when he\ndid that. He much preferred the word “attendants” to “jailers.”\nHe hadn’t realised how warm it was beneath the palace until he stepped\ninto the open air.\n“It’s like winter’s tits out here!” he gasped. The gardens were all frozen,\nevery branch on every tree picked out with a line of snow, the drainpipes\ndangling with glinting icicles, the heaps of fallen leaves from the creeper\nthat covered the palace walls glittering with frost. It might’ve been beautiful\nhad he been better dressed, but even wearing every stitch he still possessed\nthe air had a bitter bite. He was not sure whether to blow on his hands or\nwedge them under his armpits. He settled for blowing on the left one while\nwedging the right and swapping them every few strides. “Where are we\ngoing, anyway?”\n“Oh, you’ll love it,” said Halder, with a glance over his shoulder that\nimplied he wouldn’t. Not that Orso had liked anything for some weeks now.\nBefore the Great Change, he’d often joked that being High King of the\nUnion was the worst job in the world. After the Great Change, it wasn’t\neven a joke. He’d heard they were selling night pots with his face on the\ninside of the bowl. Once, the ladies of Adua had scrambled into his bed.\nNow they queued up to shit on him. He could hardly say he didn’t deserve\nit.\nSnow was falling on the park. Just dirty spots and specks against the\nHouse of the Maker, silhouetted in the winter haze. The place was almost\nempty. Lonely figures wobbled on the icy pathways, smoke pluming from\ntheir faces. A pair of children, ridiculously underdressed for the season,\nwere chasing each other around leaving spirals of footprints, hands and\nfaces chapped pink, scraping up snow and flinging it. Not so much\nsnowballs as pointless showers of glittering powder. Their giggles rang out\nas they flopped down together in the white.\n“Good to see someone’s having fun,” muttered Orso. He rather wished\nhe could join them. Especially once his destination became clear. They were\ncalling it the House of Purity now, of course, but its aspect was no more\ncomforting. The same lowering, near-windowless façade. The same guards,\nprisoners, questions. Even the crimes were mostly the same. Only the\ndirection of the treason had changed.\nHe had visited several times in the past, for unpleasant interviews with\nArch Lector Glokta, but he had never before had cause to go below ground\nlevel.

He worried that the interviews conducted down here were a great deal\nmore unpleasant yet. It was dim and chill as an ice house. No romance to\nthe place. A cheap, workmanlike feel, and it smelled of damp.\nHalder knocked on a heavy door, bound with iron. Orso wondered how\nhe would respond to torture. Badly, he suspected. Who responds well? And\nwhat possible preparation could a life of cosseted indulgence be, after all,\nfor expertly and ruthlessly applied pain? He closed his eyes, trying to find\nthat breezy courage that had somehow welled up in him at Stoffenbeck.\n“Come in.”\nThe room was a sparse white box, plaster speckled with mould in one\ncorner. There was something that looked like a badly scrubbed bloodstain\non one badly whitewashed wall.\nThere was a battered table with two battered chairs. One was empty. In\nthe other, regarding him coolly with those hard eyes that never gave\nanything away, was Inquisitor Teufel. Or Chief Inspector Teufel now, he\nsupposed. Everything had a different title than before the Great Change.\nWell, not quite everything. He had the same title, but it meant the opposite.\nTeufel looked up at Halder. “You can go.”\n“Reckon I’d better stay.”\nHer forehead showed a beautifully regular set of creases as she frowned.\n“What’s your name?”\nOrso only wished he had been able to so easily unsettle the man. “Why\nd’you want to know that?”\n“So I can tell Commissioner Pike who’s putting themselves in his way.”\nHalder swallowed noisily, lump on his throat bobbing. “I’ll wait\noutside.” And he shut the door ever so politely behind him.\n“Chief Inspector Teufel!” called Orso. “What a lovely surprise, and what\na fetching uniform. This has been a delightful outing so far, I must say. Are\nwe touring all the cellars of the Agriont? There must be miles of—”\n“I found a letter, Your Majesty. In your bread.”\nThere was a brief and highly uncomfortable silence. Orso struggled to\nstay upbeat, in spite of the yawning pit of panic that had just opened\nbeneath his chair. “You must be in desperate straits if you’re stealing my\nbread, Inspector, it’s positively horrible.”\n“We’re all in desperate straits.” Teufel slid out a stained slip of paper,\nvery like the ones Hildi had been bringing him since Tunny’s visit to his\nattic. “Royalist traitors are pressing the People’s Army hard, out there in the\neast of Midderland. And from what I read, it looks like you’re in contact\nwith Lord Marshal Forest.”\nSo, there it was. He had been very much looking forward to seeing the\nmurderous smile wiped from Judge’s face, preferably by a fall from the\nTower of Chains, but he supposed the chances of discovery had always\nbeen high. “I’ve told him to desist but you know how hard it is to stop an\nadmirer once they have the bit between their teeth.”\n“No doubt.

Bloody hell, those eyes.\nWhen it came to hiding secrets, and to digging them out, he could scarcely\nhave been further out of his league, and well knew it. “Seems Forest and his\nroyalists want to put you back on the throne. Seems they’re in touch with\nyour mother and sister, out in Sipani. Seems they’ve been sending you\nmessages via your servant—”\n“I take full responsibility!” he said, far too eagerly, and probably very\nill-advisedly, but when Hildi’s safety was at stake the time for jokes was\nover. “My servant knew nothing about… any plot…”\nTeufel was holding up a hand to stop him. She glared down, teeth bared,\nas if working herself up to some distasteful task. Orso did not care to\nimagine what kind of threats, blackmail or torture might give her pause. She\ntapped a chewed fingernail on the scarred tabletop, witness to who knew\nwhat horrors under the old regime and the new, then finally looked up at\nhim.\nWhen she spoke, her voice had turned oddly soft. “Forest isn’t the only\none who’d like to see the monarchy restored.”\nOrso had steeled himself for almost anything but that. “He isn’t?”\n“No.” She considered him a moment longer. “This madness has gone on\nlong enough. Far too long. Judge has to be stopped.” She gave a shrug of\nresignation, shoulders slumping. “And since no one else is doing it…”\nOrso felt a wave of relief that came close to loosening his bowels. “You\nmean… to help me?”\n“Against my much better judgement. The truth is, far as I can tell…\nyou’re the Union’s best chance.”\n“You… think I…” And Orso felt the smile spread right across his face. A\nsensation he had not experienced in quite some time.\n“Don’t get carried away, Your Majesty. I’m saying you’re better than\ncarnage, famine and chaos.”\n“Honestly, that’s the closest thing to praise I’ve heard in months.” And\nnot from a source prone to compliments. Orso shuffled eagerly forwards.\n“What’s your plan?” She struck him as a woman who did not get out of bed\nwithout three or four strong plans in place. “I mean to say… do you have a\nplan?”\n“Not one I like the odds on. But I can think of a few people who might\nbe brought around to your cause. With the right encouragement. The right\nthreats. The right bribes.”\nOrso patted his trousers. “I seem to be a little light at the moment. In\nfact, I’ve a hell of a debt to my valet, you’d never guess what a shirt costs\nthese days—”\n“Four chairs on the Closed Council.”\nOrso raised his brows. “Do you plan to drape yourself across them?”\n“I plan to sell them.”\n“Four chairs are a high price.”\n“I’d say it’s a pretty low price, given right now you don’t have any\nchairs at all.”\nHe pushed out his lips in a pout. “I have an old box to sit on, actually."

When I am feeling beneficent, she gets the\ncorner. I was thinking once I am restored I might have it installed in the\nactual throne room. To keep me humble.”\nHe wondered if he might have coaxed the hint of a smile from the corner\nof Teufel’s unbendable mouth. “You could do with some help in that\nregard.”\n“And, let us be honest, in every other.”\n“So I have your permission? To make offers?”\n“Might I ask to whom?”\n“Might be better if you didn’t.”\n“You’ll be talking to my enemies?”\n“If it works, you’ll have fewer enemies and more friends. Isn’t that what\neveryone wants?”\nOrso sat there for a moment. He was cold. He was drained. And he\nsuspected it would not be much longer until Judge removed him from his\ncage in the Court of the People and put him in the dock. He needed to trust\nsomeone and, honestly, if Victarine dan Teufel wanted to betray him, there\nhad been golden opportunities when she had far more to gain.\n“You have my permission, for this and anything else. You can speak\nwith my full authority, such as it is. And can I say, honestly, for once, that\nthere is no one I would rather have on my side. From the first moment I met\nyou, I have always felt safe in your hands, Inquisitor Teufel. Or…\nInspector Teufel? Or—”\n“Vick.” She pressed her fist on the tabletop, took a long breath through\nher nose, and let it sigh away. “If we’re going down in flames together, it\nmight as well be on first-name terms.”\n“Well, Vick. I have no doubt there is a healthy dose of self-interest in\nthis, and an even healthier dose of common good, but on a personal note…”\nHe leaned forwards and put his hand on hers. “I would like to thank you\nfrom the bottom of my heart for your loyalty.”\nHer face gave a strange twitch at that, and she stared down at his hand\non hers, jaw muscles clenched almost angrily. For the briefest moment, he\nhad the bizarre feeling that she was about to cry. Or perhaps punch him in\nthe face. Strange reactions, in a way, to the heartfelt thanks of one’s\nmonarch. But in the end, all she did was give him a stiff nod and ease her\nhand from under his, rubbing the back of it with the other as if his touch had\nburned her. “We’re done here!” she yelled at the door.\nBy the time it swung open and Halder stomped back in, Vick did not\nlook like a woman who had ever shed one tear. She curled her lip at Orso\nwith immaculately acted contempt. He hoped it was acted, anyway.\n“Fucking idiot doesn’t know anything,” she said.\nA Matter of Time\n“M\nove over… there.” She straddled his good leg, rubbing herself against\nit, kissing him softly, catching his hand and sliding it up her side while at\nthe same time she slipped her fingers under his nightshirt, started stroking"

And he would have gasped at the sting of it, and with\nhis eyes he would have asked to be slapped again. When he had been\nwhole, and strong as a lion, and could have flung her across the room with a\nflick of his wrist, hurting him had felt daring, thrilling, an exhilarating\ngamble.\nNow, so crippled and so vulnerable, the thought of hitting him made her\nsick. Now, looking in his eyes, she thought she saw a kind of hate for her. A\nwounded envy. She guessed that he blamed her for how things had turned\nout almost as much as she blamed herself. And she imagined he would very\nmuch have liked to fling her across the room, just to prove he still could.\nThere had been a time, not so very long ago, when he had been almost\ntoo gentle with her. Now his one hand clutched her, gripped her, yanked and\ncrushed and twisted, as if to make a point of how strong it still was. There\nhad been a time, fucking her husband, she had occasionally teetered on the\nbrink of boredom. Now she occasionally teetered on the brink of fear.\nIt was not like it had been. But what was? You have to make the best of\nit.\nShe kept rubbing at him. “What I had in mind… is a fair trade…\nfor both parties.”\n“Ah, the business arrangement. I can agree to that.” And he caught her\nunder the arm and heaved her onto her back. Probably his hope had been to\nflip her effortlessly, but with only one leg and one arm he had to rock one\nway then the other and ended up with his stump tangled in the blankets.\nOne of her hands was busy between her legs, guiding him, the other\naround the back of his head, pulling him close while at the same time she\ncould prop his shoulder up with her forearm and stop his useless hand\nflopping into the way.\nHis teeth were gritted with pain and effort, growling more with anger\nthan pleasure. She wanted to stroke his face, whisper calming noises. Fates\nhelp her, the same shushing she would have given her crying children.\nCould he not have let her ride him? It would have been far more enjoyable\nfor them both. But one works with what one has. She strained up to kiss\nhim—\nThere was a sharp cry from next door and they both froze.\nShe dropped back against the pillows. “Fuck.”\n“Let them cry,” he hissed.\n“No.” She made him grunt as she wriggled out from under him, slid\nfrom the bed and into the cold.\n“You don’t have to be at their mercy.”\nAfter all the damage she had done, motherhood was a chance to do one\nthing right. She pulled her nightgown on. “We’re all at someone’s mercy,\nLeo.”\nThrough their dressing room, dimly lit by the glow of the dying fire, and\ninto the nursery.

        "text": "Leo.”\nThrough their dressing room, dimly lit by the glow of the dying fire, and\ninto the nursery. She could tell them apart by their cries. Ardee’s howls\nwere thuggish demands. Harod’s whines were pleas for mercy. Three\nmonths old and already they were so different. Ardee fed with a purpose,\nand once she was asleep nothing would rouse her. Harod pecked and fussed\nand shook awake at the slightest sound.\nShe lifted him from his cot, quivering he was crying so hard. She held\nhim close, shushing and cooing desperately. She pulled the door to and\nwent to sit in one of the chairs beside the fire, the one with the shawl over\nthe back that still smelled like her mother—\nShe froze with a strangled gasp.\nSomeone was already sitting there. Someone in the black uniform of the\nPeople’s Inspectorate, firelight picking out the bones and hollows of a hard\nfrown. Vick dan Teufel.\n“Have I been denounced?” asked Savine. Surprising, how cool her voice\nsounded. Perhaps it was a kind of relief, if it had come, to know she need\nnot worry any more about when it would come.\n“Not yet,” said Teufel. “But we both know it’s a matter of time. Judge\nhates you.”\nNow Savine had her hammering heart under control she was damned if\nshe would give any hint of being rattled. She sank into the other chair,\npulling her nightgown open as though her breast was a hidden weapon she\nwas showing off.\nHarod wriggled about, mouth searching desperately for her nipple\neverywhere but where it was. She finally managed to get him settled and sat\nback, frowning. “Judge hates everyone.”\n“Oh, but she has some favourites.”\n“If all you have is threats you can make them during business hours.”\n“I’ve an offer, too. For you and your husband.”\n“An offer it’s better you aren’t seen making?”\n“I’m not really the front-door type.”\n“No. Thoroughly underhanded in my experience.”\n“While the Darling of the Slums never flirted with a falsehood?”\nSilence stretched while they carefully considered one another, as they\nhad a long time ago, when they shared a carriage on the way to Valbeck. “I\nsuppose you have me there,” Savine admitted. Her trouble with Teufel was\nnot that she was a liar, after all, but that she had proved herself a better liar\nthan Savine. “Do you know where my father is?” she found she had asked.\n“No. I wish I did.”\n“He hasn’t even met his grandchildren.” A ridiculous, sentimental thing\nto say to a professional torturer. She half-expected Teufel to burst out\nlaughing, but all she did was thoughtfully narrow her eyes. Savine looked\ndown at Harod. “I daresay I’m the only one who misses him.”\n“Oh, I don’t know. His tenure’s starting to look like a golden age.\nWhere’s your husband? I need both of you.”\n“I daresay he’ll be along—”\nThe door crashed open and Leo took a clanking step through on his iron\nleg, shoulder of his useless arm against the door frame, drawn sword in his\nother hand, stark naked and still halfway hard."

You might\nhave someone’s eye out with that.”\nHe lowered the sword. “If you break into people’s houses you can’t\ncomplain about what you see.”\n“Oh, I’m delighted someone in the city’s still having fun.” Teufel\nwatched him limp to the settle, toss his sword down and drop onto the\ncushions. He winced as he twisted his iron leg off then sat back, his stump\nthrust forwards. When he’d been a perfect specimen of manhood he’d\nalways been oddly modest. Now he loved to put his many scars on display\nand see how people reacted. To no one’s surprise, the inspector was\nunmoved.\n“I appreciate the visit,” said Leo, “but knowing how much you value\nhonesty—I don’t like you.”\n“Good. Mutual suspicion is the best basis for an alliance. Everyone\nknows where they stand.”\nLeo frowned. “An alliance?”\n“Forgive me for saying so,” said Savine, “but the last time you came\noffering help it turned out rather badly for us.”\n“You were betraying King Orso then.”\n“And now?”\n“You’d be helping me put him back on the throne.”\nThere was a pause one could only have called pregnant. Savine spent it\nthinking of the old Union, her old life, her old self, and trying not to let her\ndesperate yearning show. “I somehow doubt… that Judge would simply\ngive the power back.”\n“No.” Vick leaned forwards, the firelight bright on one side of her face,\nthe other lost in shadow. “We’d have to take it.”\nSavine held Harod a little tighter. More blood. More death. She glanced\nover at Leo. No sign of doubt in his eyes. Quite the reverse.\n“What do we get?” he asked.\n“Four chairs on the Closed Council, when it’s reconvened.”\nSavine could not help taking a sharp breath. Four chairs would once\nhave been a dazzling prize. In the old days, Arch Lector Sult and High\nJustice Marovia had ruined lives by the hundred over a single one.\n“What if I want more?” asked Leo.\n“I’m not here to bargain. Four’s what I’ve got and four’s what I’m\noffering. It’s fair.”\n“Fair might look different from where I sit,” said Leo. “With what I’ve\nlost.”\n“You could always ask Judge for more.”\n“She might listen if I offered her a treacherous chief inspector in return.”\nLeo’s threats moved Teufel no more than his scars or his cock. “Go\nahead. But don’t be surprised if I say the whole thing was your idea, but\nyou got greedy and wanted more than I could offer. As you both know, I can\nbe quite convincing. I expect we’d all end up in the dock together, probably\nwith a tailor, and an engraver, and a couple of dark-skinned strangers,\naccused of a conspiracy to make the river freeze.”\nIt all sounded depressingly plausible. “What exactly do you expect us to"

For four chairs, she imagined it would be quite a\nlot.\n“Your friends from Angland, your friends from the Open Council.” She\npaused a moment. “And the People’s Army.”\n“I don’t have it,” snapped Leo.\n“If you stretched, I reckon you could get your fingers around it.”\n“And what do you deliver?”\n“Lord Marshal Forest and his rebels, well-organised royalists inside the\ncity, information from inside the Inspectorate, Styrian contacts and Styrian\nmoney. Not to mention the king’s blessing. And the king’s forgiveness.”\n“You’ve spoken to Orso?” asked Savine.\nTeufel gazed levelly back. “I have.”\nShe resisted the urge to ask how he was. “And you have his agreement?”\n“I do.”\n“And we’re supposed to take your word for it?” sneered Leo. “Forgive\nme if I—”\nSavine cut him off. “Judge has to be stopped.” She had dreamed, last\nnight, of falling from a high place, and woken in a cold sweat. “At any\nprice.”\nLeo gave an unhappy grunt. “Well. On that we can all agree.”\n“Four chairs on the Closed Council is fair.” After everything that had\nhappened, it was far more than they could have hoped for. “We will provide\nthe Anglanders, and the ex-lords of the Open Council, and the People’s\nArmy.”\nLeo took a breath and sighed noisily through flared nostrils. “Great\ntempests wash up strange companions, Farans said.”\n“Never had you down for a philosopher,” said Teufel.\n“I’ve been catching up on my classics.”\nThe inspector gave a sharp little nod. “Then we all have lots of work to\ndo. I’ll see myself out.”\nThe door clicked shut. Harod had stopped feeding, his head rolled back,\nmouth open, a dribble of milk on his chin. Savine lifted him, carried him to\nthe nursery, softly lowered him into his cot, chewing her lip with\nconcentration as she slid her hands out from under him and left him beside\nhis sister.\nShe looked down at them, both sleeping. Ardee on her side, one long-\nlashed eye closed and her mouth wide open. Harod on his back, tiny hands\npalm-up as if he was surrendering. So small. So perfect. So vulnerable. She\nremembered something her father once told her. Being a parent means\nalways being afraid. Afraid for your children. Afraid of your children.\nWhen she turned from pulling the nursery door ever-so-gently closed,\nLeo was watching her.\n“So we’re in bed with King Orso now, are we?”\nSavine winced. Did he really have to use that phrase? “We are taking the\nbest chance to bring this nightmare to an end.” And perhaps to repair a\nfraction of the damage they had done. “We can’t trust Judge, Leo, you know\nthat.”\n“She likes me well enough.”\nShe winced even more at that. He could only be saying it to annoy her."

That bitter, jealous look. “Do you still love\nhim?”\nAgain, the urge to slap him. “I never loved him,” she lied.\n“Not even as a brother?”\nThis time she wanted to punch him. She realised her fist was clenched to\ndo it. But she made it open. The satisfaction would not have lasted long.\nAnd she could let him be angry. She had all her limbs, after all.\nShe slipped one knee down beside him. “What can I do… to prove it?”\nAnd she worked her other knee onto the settle so she was straddling him.\nShe pulled her nightgown up with her right hand, down with her left,\ncool of the night on one bare shoulder, warmth of the fire on the other. She\ndid not look in his eyes. She was not sure she would like what was in them.\nThere had been a time, not so very long ago, when he had claimed to love\nher and, if she squinted, she had almost been able to convince herself that\nshe loved him. But you have to make the best of it.\nShe took his hand, guided it, slid it up her chest. She took his face,\nkissing him, working her hips against his stomach. It was not like it had\nbeen. But what was? She reached behind her, found his prick, rubbed\nherself against it, looking for the right spot—\nThe cry echoed from the other room. Ardee, this time, hard and insistent.\nA moment later Harod joined her, higher, faster, weaker. She closed her\neyes and sagged.\n“Fuck.”\nTaking and Keeping\nS\nhe’d never thought so when it was happening, but Rikke had to admit\nthat she quite liked being bullied. She’d heaps of practice, and it brought\nout the stubborn best in her. Plucky Rikke. Everyone loved that girl. Sharp\nthinking, sharp talking, with the odds against her but right on her side.\nIt was the opposite that landed her in trouble. Folk begging, wheedling,\npleading, it made her all weak and nervy.

There was a whole queue of hat-twisters outside\nSkarling’s Hall ready to fling themselves onto their knees at the least\nprovocation. If she was soft on one, she’d have to be soft on ’em all. And\nsoft might feel good for a day, but it can hurt in the long run. Hurt everyone.\n“Hmmm,” she grunted. “Hmmm.”\nAll the while, from inside his cage, the watery eyes of that born bully\nStour bloody Nightfall were on her, as if to say, You wouldn’t have caught\nme showing too much mercy.\nRikke’s father had worn being a leader so lightly no one realised they\nwere being led. Listening far more’n he spoke. Folk nodding at his every\nword like they never heard such wisdom, even if all he was doing was\nexcusing himself for a piss. Sitting on his bench with the old sheepskin\naround his shoulders, chin propped on his fist. She tried to sit that way, too,\nbut it didn’t work in Skarling’s Chair, she ended up squirming around like\nshe didn’t belong there. Her father had earned everyone’s respect, over\nyears. Rikke didn’t have years. And it sometimes seemed folk would\nindulge a man’s mistakes, while they held a woman’s against her.\nIf Isern had been there, she’d have told her to make of her heart a stone.\nTo bury her doubts in a shallow grave. A sprinkle of blood now might save\na flood later. Viciousness is a quality much loved o’ the moon. But Isern\nwasn’t there. Rikke realised she was fussing at the ring through her nose,\nand forced her hand away, and ended up picking at the arm of Skarling’s\nChair with her fingernail instead, which was no better.\n“What do you think, Corleth?”\nThe girl blinked. “Me?”\n“Far as I know, you’re the only Corleth I’ve got.”\nShe stared at the farmer, then back at Rikke. “I guess it was a tough\nharvest. And it’s been a tough winter.”"

A tough winter for everyone.” Rikke slumped down unhappily.\n“You can pay half now. But you’ll make it up after the next harvest, you\nhear?”\nFrom her father it would’ve sounded patient and level-headed. From her\nit sounded like a thin-beer compromise. She saw it on the faces. Hardbread\nscratching his wispy pate. The warriors about the hall sighing away like\nbellows. Now every farmer in the North would be trying every trick to\ntickle out her mercy.\n“You’ll be making it up to me!” she screeched as the man hurried out,\nmaking herself sound weaker’n ever. There was another fellow shoving in\nat the same moment. A warrior from Uffrith, used to be one of Red Hat’s\nCarls.\n“I’ve got news!” he called, and from the look on his face it wasn’t good.\nGood news felt like a thing she’d heard about but never actually seen, like\ndragons or deserts.\n“Don’t keep it to yourself,” she grumbled.\n“It’s the Nail! He came wi’ four hundred Carls. He took Buddlehay, on\nthe river. Killed three men and said the village was his. He said Uffrith’ll be\nhis as well.”\n“That treacherous fucking arsehole!” snarled Rikke, jumping out of\nSkarling’s Chair. “Thinks he can stab us in the back while we’re tied up wi’\nCalder! I’ll see the bloody cross cut in him!”\nHardbread looked even more worried than usual. “We send men to fight\nthe Nail, we’ll scarcely have enough to keep Carleon, let alone to hold the\nwalls if Calder comes.”\nShivers rubbed at his jaw. “Folk here still aren’t sure about you—”\n“You think they like Black Calder better?” snapped Rikke.\n“No one likes Black Calder. They worry what’ll happen if he wins.”\nA silence. “And they think he will,” Rikke finished for him.\nHardbread spread his hands. “Isern-i-Phail’s gone, the Nail’s turned\nagainst us…”\nJust went to show, people say they want fair rulers but, in the end, they’d\nrather have a bastard in charge. Case of what they’re used to, maybe. She\nhopped down from the dais so she could talk to the two old Named Men at\ncloser quarters. “So what? We give up Skarling’s Chair? After all the work\nwe’ve put in taking it?”\nHardbread shrugged. “In the end… it’s just a chair.”\n“It bloody isn’t!” Rikke snapped, making him turn his wrinkled old face\naway, as if from a chilly wind. “It’s a sign o’ who’s in charge. I let Black\nCalder take it back and he’ll take back the North, bit by bit, and we’ll be\nstuck where we started, but without Angland to help us. Have we heard\naught from Clover?”\n“Nothing,” said Shivers. “But we know Calder’s gathering men.”\nHardbread was nodding away. “He’s never done things by halves. Might\nhave an army ready to march by now.”"

Everyone turned to look at\nher, and she went a bit pink in the cheeks, but she kept talking. “Not so cold\nas it was, but there’s snow thick on the roads towards Currahome. No way\nCalder comes till the weather warms. Should be time for men to make it to\nthe West Valleys and back ’fore spring.”\nShivers looked unhappy. Even more than usual. “It’s a risk.”\nRikke wished she had a chagga pellet to push around her mouth, but\nIsern wasn’t there to roll ’em, so she was going without. “Have to take\nsome risks if you’re going to win. Hardbread? Gather every man we can\nspare.”\nHe gave Shivers a worried glance. “All right.”\nRikke drew him close, lowering her voice. “As we discussed, now,\nHardbread. You remember what we discussed?”\n“I do,” he said. “You can rely on me.”\nRikke frowned. “Don’t like it when folk say they can be relied on.\nImplies a strong possibility they can’t be. My father had three War Chiefs.\nRed Hat, Oxel and you. I remember ’em fondly. Well, apart from Oxel, he\nwas a cunt. But you’re the last of that whole crowd.” She reached out and\ngently adjusted his mail coat. “Wouldn’t want you to go the same way.”\n“They both got murdered in the Circle,” said Hardbread.\nRikke gave him a significant look from under her brows. “I know. I’m\nthe one made it happen.”\nThere was a pause. Hardbread swallowed. “I remember what we\ndiscussed.”\n“Get to it, then, y’old bastard! I want to see the Nail strung up by his\nfucking fruits!”\n“Won’t they just… I don’t know… tear off?”\n“I didn’t mean it literally.” Rikke scratched her head. “But I guess if\nthey did, that’d get the point across.” Certainly no one would be\ncomplaining that she was too soft afterwards.\nHardbread gave a weary nod, and beckoned the warriors of Uffrith after\nhim, and tramped towards the doors.\n“The two o’ you had a lot to talk about,” muttered Corleth.\n“You know how these bloody old men are.” Rikke threw an arm around\nthe girl’s solid shoulders. “That was some wise counsel you gave.”\n“Just… what felt right.”\n“Don’t be afraid to speak your mind. I need some good advice, with\nIsern gone. In fact, I could’ve used some while she was still here. Heart a\nstone and beloved o’ the moon and blah, blah fucking blah. I want you to\nstay close to me.”\nCorleth blinked. “’Course, Chief.”\n“I know it’s a weight, having responsibility dropped on you from a\nheight, all unexpected, believe me I know, but you’ve got the shoulders for\na burden, eh?” And Rikke hugged her tighter, walking her towards the"

But I daresay you want to check in on your grandmother. Make\nsure her fire stays banked in this weather.” Though it wasn’t near as cold as\nit had been, thaw water dripping from the archway above.\n“Aye,” said Corleth. “Reckon I’ll do that.”\n“Bring me back a bowl o’ that soup, eh?” And Rikke watched her pick\nher way across the yard towards the gate. The snow was mostly gone now,\nmelted down to slushy patches at the corners of the walls. “Best soup in\nCarleon, I swear!”\nRikke gave a cheery wave. Then as Corleth disappeared she let her hand\ndrop, her smile fading, her shoulders slumping, the worry gnawing at her.\n“By the dead,” she muttered. “It ain’t easy, being chief.”\nShivers stepped up beside her. “Might be why everyone told you it’d be\nhard,” he said, in that breathy whisper of his.\n“Aye, well, I’ve a habit of not listening to things I don’t want to hear.”\n“You don’t say.”\n“You’ve got to always look like you know the way.” Rikke found she\nwas fussing with her necklace yet again and had to pull her hand away. Bad\nhabit, the fussing and fiddling, it made her look weak. “Like you’re always\nsure, even if you’re farting doubts with every step.” She glanced about,\nmaking certain no one was watching, then looked up at him. “Am I doing\nthe right thing, Shivers? Tell me I’m doing the right thing.”\n“Take a breath,” he said, looking sideways at her. “It’s just soup.”\n“Don’t toy with me, you old fucker, you know what I mean. Am I doing\nthe right thing with Isern, with the Nail, with Black bloody Calder.” She\nwaved a floppy hand at Skarling’s Chair and took the cage with Stour\nNightfall in, too. “With all of it.”\n“You’re the one wi’ the Long Eye,” he said.\n“More curse than blessing, that’s the truth of it.” She pressed her hand\nagainst the tattooed side of her face, cold and clammy now, and gave it an\nimpatient rub. “I can pretend I know what’s coming, but all it really gives\nyou is more questions.”\n“Wish I had some answers. Truth is, though…” He leaned close to\nwhisper in her ear. “I spent most o’ my life stumbling from one fuck-up to\nanother.”\nShe glanced at his ruined face. “You’d never know to look at you.” And\nshe found she was fussing with her necklace and forced her hand away from\nit with a grunt of frustration. “Just sometimes… I wish I was still someone\nof no importance.”\n“You’ve always been of importance to me.” She felt the weight of\nShivers’ hand on her shoulder and was grateful for it. “There’s only one\nthing I can tell you for sure.

Whatever comes, I’ll be here.”\nShe put her own hand on top of his, and took a deep breath, and puffed it\nout in a smoky sigh. They stood together in the entrance of Skarling’s Hall,\nwatching the meltwater drip, drip, drip from the archway.\nThaw\nD\nrip, drip, drip. Cold water, onto Clover’s head, his shoulders, his back,\nworking its way through every seam, trickling, tickling against his sore and\nclammy skin.\n“Bloody dripping,” he muttered, frowning up at the branches, but rain\nwas just one more of life’s buffets he was powerless to prevent.\n“Guess we could move out from under the trees,” muttered Flick.\n“Aye, but then we’d have the mud to deal with.” Clover shook his head\nand scraped a smear of dirt from his trousers with his thumbnail. Wasted\neffort, since they’d be spattered afresh before you knew it. “Bloody mud.\nWorst thing about war.”\n“Worse’n the death?” asked Sholla, who’d been busy for the past hour at\nleast with her endless quest to cut the thinnest slice of cheese imaginable.\n“Death is but an occasional hazard. Mud is a constant.” And Clover\nrubbed that bit of dirt thoughtfully between thumb and forefinger. “Strange,\nisn’t it? Soil and water are both good things. Things you can’t live without.\nBut mix the two and add an army, you’ve got a nightmare.”\nIt’d been a cold winter, snow banked up man tall in the High Places.\nWith the weather tilting warmer, seemed the world was melting. Water\ndripped from the trees. Dripped from the eaves of Currahome’s sodden\nhouses. Seeped through the boggy grass and gathered in the streams and\nswole ’em to dirty rivers. Downside came squelching over, knocking\nmelting snow from the brambles.\n“Where have you been?” asked Clover.\n“There’s two things I enjoy, fucking and killing. I can’t do the one, so\nI’ve been at the other.”\nSholla didn’t look up from her cheese-cutting. “And did your hand enjoy\nit as much as you did?”\nClover chuckled. Flick chuckled. Downside frowned as he worked it\nthrough, then he worked it out, and frowned more. Didn’t say anything,\nthough. No doubt he could’ve twisted Sholla’s head off in a wrestling\nmatch, but he knew that in a battle of wits she was much the better armed.\n“By the dead, boy,” grunted Clover as Flick nudged him in the ribs,\n“you’ve got the sharpest damn elbows in the North—” Then he saw the\nworry. Black Calder, stalking over with a grim crowd of Named Men, all\nstriving to look mighty while they tiptoed through the winter muck.\n“Chief!” Clover jumped up, slapping dirt from the seat of his trousers.\nHe knew he was on thin ice with Calder, so he was being specially\naccommodating. “Good to see you!”\nCalder frowned up from under wrinkled brows. “Don’t spoon it on too"

Every river’ll be swollen,\nevery ford neck high, every road a bloody mire. That’s ’fore we even set\nfoot on it. We’ll be drowning in mud by the time we get to Carleon!”\nCalder narrowed his eyes. “Might be we’ll lose a couple of the weak\nones, but I’ll see the rest there. Aren’t you always carping on how a man\nhas to seize his moment? The moment’s come, whatever the weather.\nRikke’s weak. The Nail’s swinging his prick down south and she’s had to\nsend Hardbread to deal with him.” He gave a snort. “When bloody\nHardbread’s your answer you know you’re short on choices.” And some of\nhis Named Men dug out a chuckle. “She’s hardly got enough warriors to\nhold on to Carleon, let alone to hold it against us. I mean to get there before\nshe can find any more. And Stand-i’-the-Barrows is growing restless. If we\ndon’t find him some folk to kill, he’ll find ’em here.”\nClover frowned up towards the bone and hide standards planted on the\nhigh ground. “You can tell the best allies ’cause they’re so fixed on taking\nmen’s bones they’ll skin friends if they run out of enemies.”\n“Allies all have their shortcomings.”\n“Some more’n others.”\n“Like lazy fucks whose first preference is sitting under a tree and whose\nsecond is betraying you? Don’t try my patience, Clover, I’ve none to spare\nthese days. We march today.”\nClover took a long breath, then forced the smile onto his face.\n“Whatever you say, Chief.” He made sure he kept grinning as Calder and\nhis men strode off towards the hall, spreading the bad news to each fire they\npassed.\nFlick doused theirs with a hiss and Clover turned about to stare at him.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Well… we’re marching, ain’t we? Don’t want to leave it burning.”\n“What? You’re afraid this fucking morass will catch fire? There’s a\nwhole valley to empty and only one road. We’ll be lucky if we’re off the\nspot by nightfall.

Calder, meanwhile, knew Clover\nhad betrayed him once already and handed his beloved son over for rough\nhandling by his enemies. Putting it nicely. He might be telling the truth\nwhen he said he liked Clover. But Black Calder had killed men he liked\nmore for lesser offences. And that was without considering the outcome if\nthe Great Wolf ever did get his freedom.\nClover winced. Something he did whenever he considered the current\nsituation. “Seems we might be trapped ’twixt the mountains and the sea, so\nto speak.”\n“You are,” said Sholla. “Doubt anyone much cares about the rest of us.”\n“Oh, you’d be surprised how vengeance, falling from a great height, can\nspatter the most innocent o’ bystanders. And you, my cheese-shaving\nbeauty, by no means qualify.”\n“Hmmm.” She glanced over at Trapper, who was happening past with\nthe remnants of his dozen, and pushed her tangled hair off her dirty\nface so she could try out a smile. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it won nothing\nfrom him. “Running away might be an option,” she murmured through her\nfixed grin.\n“By all means take to your heels, but running’s for the young. I need to\nsit down. Somewhere dry. And I reckon my best chance of that is to stay\nclose to the action and try to nudge things my way.” Clover scratched\ngently at his scar. “Close to the action, by the dead. You make every effort\nto steer clear o’ something, and all you do is end up mired to your fucking\nneck in it.”\n“We’ll all be mired soon enough.” Flick stared at the bog in the valley\nbottom and gave a gloomy sniff.\nSholla leaned close. “D’you reckon there comes a time when you’ve\nbetrayed folk so often that there’s no one left to betray?”\nClover gave a weary sigh. “We may find out.”\nLove, Hate, Fear\nT"

The winners are those who change with\nthem.\nThe gilded hallways echoed with strange sounds, something between a\ndemented carnival and a riot. Jagged music came from somewhere. Or\nmaybe someone was smashing a harp. There was an odd smell, like a cheap\nbrothel. Slashed paintings of smug monarchs had been hung upside down.\nA neatly dressed, dark-skinned man sat in a chair, fussing nervously with\nhis hat and jumping at every sound. Some ambassador, maybe. A pair of\nwomen in red dresses scarcely fastened stumbled giggling past, one holding\na wine bottle, the other a pot of slopping paint, leaving a snaking trail of red\nfootprints behind them.\n“They used to say the heart of the state was rotten,” muttered Glaward,\nwith one glance back over his shoulder. “Now look at it.”\n“It’s hell,” whispered Jurand. “They’ve turned it into bloody hell.”\nSnow swirled in through a broken window, bang, bang, banging a\nshutter against the frame and leaving a chilly puddle in the hallway.\nOverstoked blazes in every fireplace made it greasy-hot even so, and if that\nwasn’t enough to get the sweat springing from Leo’s forehead there were\narmed Burners everywhere, armour dotted with red paint. Some of them\neven had their faces smeared with crimson lady’s blusher, stuck somewhere\nbetween war-daubed savages from beyond the Crinna and murderous\nclowns.\n“Please! He’s innocent. I swear!”\nA cultured voice, weeping and begging at once, coming from a door ajar,\nits lock hacked away with an axe.\n“They’re taking him to the tower today!”\n“Maybe I could talk to Judge on your behalf, Lilott…” A man’s voice.\nHe sounded like he was enjoying himself.\n“Just tell me what I can do!”\n“Get your clothes off, for a start.”\nGlaward faltered, jaw clenched as the strip of light from that slightly\nopen door fell across his face. “Should we do something?” he whispered.\nLeo didn’t even slow down. “Don’t be fucking ridiculous.”\nBefore the Great Change it would’ve been him asking whether they\nshould do something. Bursting through that door in some self-indulgent,\nself-defeating puke of gallantry. But then he used to be a reckless, soft-\nhearted fool.

Leo\nclenched his jaw and upped the pace, his face twitching with each scrape of\nhis metal foot.\nHe was finding a way to live with this shit, wasn’t he? So could she.\nEverywhere the walls were hacked and scored, carvings scarred where\nthe sun of the monarchy had been torn down, chiselled out, scraped away.\nSlogans had been sloshed in their place in red paint. Rise up. Equality.\nMidderland for its People. And finally, across the tiled floor at the foot of a\nstairway crusted with gilded leaves, Fuck yourselves.\nJurand raised his brows. “I never yet saw the Burners’ philosophy so\nsuccinctly expressed.”\n“That gets to the heart of it,” muttered Leo as he struggled up the steps.\nFlat, he could almost manage now without a cane. Stairs were still an\nembarrassment. He had to take them one at a time, slightly sideways. Cane\nfirst, then the false leg, then the good one. There was always a moment,\nwhen the weight went through his stump, through the socket, through his\niron foot, when he’d feel like he was about to fall. Always a moment when\nhe gritted his teeth against the pain and simply refused to go down.\nHe realised Glaward was lurking at his elbow, as if to catch him. “Don’t\nhover,” he grunted.\n“He’d rather you didn’t brain yourself,” said Jurand, trotting past.\nLeo paused at the top of the steps to catch his breath, let the pain in his\nthrobbing stump subside, mop away sweat with the back of his good sleeve,\nwedge the other more firmly into his jacket. He became aware of a regular\ncreaking of furniture through the closed door beside him. A noisy grunting,\ngroaning, moaning. At least four different voices. One might’ve been\ncrying.\n“They’re either fucking or killing each other,” muttered Jurand.\n“Or both,” said Leo, setting himself as proudly as he could for the last\nfew steps to Judge’s door.\nHer office was a huge domed chamber choked with rubbish. Empty\nbottles. Full bottles. Bent cutlery. Axes and flatbows. Stained and ripped-up\nbundles of documents. A half-picked chicken carcass. Antique vases used as\nashtrays. An ornate bed the size of a small warship had half its silk curtains\nhanging in tatters, one of its pillows split and spilling feathers across the\nfloor, dancing in a draft. Jurand was staring at something with a vaguely\nhorrified expression. Leo followed his gaze. He hoped he was mistaken. He\nvery much hoped.

A woman bound up in bandoliers of little knives squatted\nagainst the wall, rolling dice. A pair of scarred men watched the snow fall\noutside one of the narrow windows. An ill-favoured bastard with a badly\nbroken face sneered at them, arms folded.\nGunnar Broad stood in towering silence, sipping from a bottle as he\nwatched Leo limp in. He’d changed as much as the palace, and in much the\nsame direction. No trace of the careful guardian who’d watched over Leo\nand Savine that day in the slums. His eyes, tiny behind those thick lenses,\nhad an awful blankness Leo didn’t want to meet. As if the only reason he\nhadn’t exploded into violence was that he couldn’t decide whose head to\ncrush first.\nJudge sprawled beside him on a monstrous couch in front of a\nmonstrous fire. She wore a tattered robe of bright Suljuk silk that showed a\nslice of pale, knobbly breastbone and an angry dotting of rash all the way\nup her neck. Her hair hung in a tangled orange curtain over one eye, the\nother narrowed, red-rimmed, fixed on Leo.\n“If it ain’t Citizen Brock himself.” That black eye darted to Jurand and\nGlaward. “And the survivors o’ the Young Lion’s Angland boys’ club.\nWelcome to my parlour.”\nAn ancient mural covered the walls, or its battered remains, at least.\nAbove Judge’s head, an old man lay bleeding in a forest, five figures\nwalking away from him on one side, six on the other. Leo hadn’t taken\nmuch notice of his tutors, so he’d only the vaguest idea what it represented.\nThe death of Juvens, bleeding his last while his apprentices, the magi,\nmarched off to avenge him. He supposed the balding one at the front was\nBayaz, but someone had scraped his face off and daubed a red cock in its\nplace.\nProbably it had been quite the masterpiece a few months ago, but the\nBurners had set to work on it like everything else, hacked and hammered at\nit, daubed bold slogans and crabby treatises and crude horns and tails and\nchildish obscenities over it, adding to Juvens’ wounds until he was bleeding\na great dripping flood around the fireplace.\nJudge grinned. “Fire, death and vengeance. And my favourite wizard.”\nShe waved at the wall behind Leo and he twisted to frown over his\nshoulder. Looming above the door he’d come in by, grim, forbidding and\nuntouched by red paint, was Juvens’ brother, and his murderer, the Master\nMaker Kanedias, spreading his arms wide with a sea of flames behind him.\n“Now there’s a bastard who knew how to set fires.”\nLeo forced a smile over his disgust and limped into the room, feeling\nlike a cockerel strutting into a fox’s den. “Citizeness Judge! I believe you\nsent for me.”\n“You believe correctly. Why don’t you all sit down?” Judge waved to"

Why don’t you all sit down?” Judge waved to\nbattered chairs. “Just shove that shit on the floor.”\n“I’d rather stand.”\nShe looked down at his leg and wrinkled her nose in a disbelieving little\ngrin. “That’s a funny thing for a one-legged man to rather do. Come on.\nTake the weight off your foot. Have some fucking tea.” She nudged a teapot\nacross the table through a rattling mass of junk, knocking a stack of books\nflapping to the floor. “Not a fan of Southern habits myself but a little tea can\npoke the right hole.”\nGlaward righted a toppled nursing chair and perched nervously on its\nedge. One of the men at the window bared his teeth and gave a strange hiss.\nLeo winced as he tried to sit with a measure of dignity. Judge had fished a\nhusk-pipe from the rubbish, was sucking on it hard enough to make her\ncheeks go hollow.\n“You all reckon I’m mad, don’t you?” she said, letting smoke spill from\nher nose in brown plumes like a dragon.\nThere was a nervous silence. Jurand cleared his throat. “I wouldn’t say\n—”\n“Being mad has its uses. Or having people think you’re mad does. They\ndon’t see you coming. King Orso saw you coming at Stoffenbeck, didn’t he,\nYoung Lion?”\n“He did,” said Leo. “From a thousand miles away. A painful lesson. One\nI’ll never need to learn again.”\n“They’re the best kind. Risinau thought I was mad. Still a few bits of\nhim spattered about the moat, I expect. So much for madness. So much for\nsanity.” She offered out the pipe. “Smoke?”\n“I should keep a clear head.”\n“Good idea.” She spun the pipe across the floor, leaving a trail of\nsmoking ash. “Very… sane.”\nThe dead help him, Leo thought he could still hear those people fucking.\nOr killing each other. Maybe it was a different set.\nJurand cleared his throat again. “I understand… there has been another\ndefeat. In the east.”\n“Mmm,” grunted Judge. “Forest got the better of the People’s Army yet\nagain. General Cutler and a few of his losing officers are being dragged\nback to Adua to be tried for treason. Seems giving little men big men’s\nshoes doesn’t make ’em big. Just makes ’em trip over.” She let her head\ndrop to one side. “Now Forest and his traitors are marching for Adua to put\nour dunce of a king back on the throne, would you believe. Quite the\nmilitary muddle. Seems the Great Change is in need of a hero to save it.”\nHer brows went up as though the idea had only now occurred. “How’re you\nfixed, Young Lion? Keen to get back in the saddle?”\nFor some months now, in fact, and especially since Vick dan Teufel’s\nrecent visit, but Leo tried not to let his desires lead him about by the nose\nany more. “If I’m called on to defend the Great Change,” he said calmly,\n“I’ll do my duty.”"

It’s quite the story. Have some fucking tea, really.” And she\nsettled back into her cushions and propped one bare foot up onto the table,\nstaring thoughtfully up at the Master Maker.\nAnd Leo realised with a cold start that her gown had fallen open and\ngiven half the room a full view of her ginger quim. He couldn’t tell if she’d\ndone it on purpose, but something about the way she stuck it so carelessly\nin his face faintly terrified him. There was nothing he wanted to see less, but\nsomehow he had to keep steering his eyes away.\n“I don’t know who my parents were,” she mused, wriggling her toes.\n“Settlers in the Far Country, maybe. But they were killed when I was a\nchild, and I was stolen by the Ghosts. Raised by the Ghosts. In the clan of\nGreat Sangeed, the Emperor of the Plains.”\nThe woman with the knives looked up from her dice and chuckled.\nJudge frowned over at her. “Do I fucking amuse you?”\nShe shook her head and went back to her dice.\n“They treated me lower’n dirt, the Ghosts. Lower’n a slave. But on\naccount of my being an outsider, they made me judge o’ the disputes\nbetween their clans. Wasn’t about justice, or innocence, or guilt. It was\nabout what had to be done. Keeping the balance between the groups on the\nplain, so no one got too much power over the others.” She rubbed at the\npatchy stubble on the side of her head. “’Course, the settlers came more and\nmore, in their fellowships, and they picked the Ghosts off one by one, and\ndrove away the hunting and poisoned the water. One day they came to the\nvillage and killed everyone I knew and told me I was rescued. And they\nasked me what my name was, and do you know what I said?”\n“Judge.”\nShe snapped her fingers. “You’re no fool. Maybe that’s why I play judge\nnow. They gave me a passion for keeping the balance.”\n“That sounds more like an excuse than a reason,” murmured Jurand.\nLeo frowned sideways at him. “They’re the same thing seen from\ndifferent sides.”\n“Ha!” Judge jabbed at Leo with a finger. “I was going to say the very\nsame thing! He’s not just a pretty face, eh, Broad?”\nBroad stared at Leo, jaw muscles squirming, and took a sip from his\nbottle. Leo wondered whether he was so angry he couldn’t speak, or so\ndrunk he’d forgotten how. Maybe both.\n“You know the trouble with a pretty face?” Judge was saying. “People\nget used to its advantages, and when it’s took away, they lack the\nwherewithal to make a success of themselves. Nothing sadder’n a person\nwho used to be beautiful. They have this desperate smile. Like me, it says.\nLike me, even though there’s nothing left to like.”\nShe sat forwards—putting her groin back in shadow, thank the dead—"

Like me, it says.\nLike me, even though there’s nothing left to like.”\nShe sat forwards—putting her groin back in shadow, thank the dead—\nand slid a hatchet from the table. Glaward stirred nervously as she lifted it,\nbut all she did was hack a leg from the chicken carcass with a couple of\nechoing bangs that caused a sleepy mew of upset from the room next door.\nShe tossed the axe down, started gnawing hungrily at the bone then paused.\n“What were we talking about?”\n“The leadership of the People’s Army,” said Leo, as though it was a\nmatter of total indifference. He’d hardly spoken, but he felt as if her eyes\nwere sizing him up and slitting him open and probing at his guts like a\nphysician at a cadaver even so.\n“Right!” She stabbed at him with the chicken bone and a piece of meat\nflew off and stuck to the floor behind him. “A lot’s changed this past year or\ntwo, but you’re still popular. That military business is in your bones and\nfighting men respect you. Beat Stour Nightfall in a circle of blood and all. I\nhear you used to be reckless, but I reckon you’ve been cured o’ that. Can’t\nsay I trust you, but then I never trust anyone I trust, if you see what I mean?\nYou’re a risk, but nothing’s safe these days, and nothing safe’s worthwhile\nanyway.”\n“So…”\n“So you’re the perfect choice.” And she sat and gnawed away at that\nbone.\n“But…?”\n“But you’re not the only one who wants something.” Judge tossed the\nstripped bone down, licked her fingers, then dried them off by dragging her\nhair out of her face. “Do you know the person I’d most like to put on trial?”\nLeo didn’t want to draw this out. A conversation with Judge was a game\nthat could turn fatal at any moment. He wondered who he’d most like to see\non trial. “King Orso?”\nShe wrinkled her nose. “That walking cock? No. Have you ever read\none o’ Sworbreck’s books?”\nLeo would rather have drunk Sworbreck’s piss. “I’m… not much of\na reader.”\n“You should. They got me through some hard times. The last chapter is\nthe sentimental fairwell. But the climax of the story is a little bit before. The\ndanger. The excitement. The triumph. You see? Putting King Orso on trial,”\nshe shrugged her bony shoulders high. “That’s the last chapter. It has to be\ndone, but it’ll get no one’s juices flowing, eh, Broad?”\nBroad stayed silent.\n“No, the person I’d most like to put on trial is Old Sticks himself. Sand\ndan fucking Glokta. He was the one who set the policies. The one who did\nthe torturing and raised the gibbets and made all the examples. The one who\nracked up most o’ the names we’ve carved into the Square of Martyrs.”\nJudge curled back her lips in disgust. “But like the cunning old louse he is,\nhe’s wriggled away into the woodwork. I need someone in the dock who\ncan help me winkle out the cripple.” She raised her red brows expectantly."

I need someone in the dock who\ncan help me winkle out the cripple.” She raised her red brows expectantly.\n“Well, we never wasted much warmth on each other, I promise you. I’ve\nno idea where—”\n“I want to put your wife on trial.”\nJudge was smiling, so Leo took it for a joke, and managed a sour grin\nhimself. “You’re joking.”\n“I’m fucking not,” she hissed, showing her teeth. “I want your word—if\nI put your wife on trial, you’ll do nothing to stop me. She denounces her\nfather, tells us where he can be found, I daresay the court could find its way\nto clemency. Eh? Eh? Eh?”\nLeo swallowed. His heart was beating very loud. He glanced up at\nBroad, but the man’s eye-lenses had caught the light from a window and\nwere bright white, so Leo couldn’t see his eyes. There was something dead\nabout his thickly stubbled face. Scabs on his tattooed knuckles. A welt of\nbruises on one side of his neck. He lifted his bottle, and took a sip.\n“Leo…” he heard Glaward whisper, and Leo held up a hand to silence\nhim.\nIt was less than a year ago, if you could believe it, that he had introduced\nSavine to the people of Angland, cheering on the dockside, full of pride and\nadmiration. He remembered using the word love, even though he wasn’t\nsure now what he’d meant by it. If someone had threatened a hair on his\nwife’s head then, they would’ve faced his rash and righteous fury. But there\nhad been a Great Change since. A change in so many things. He couldn’t\nafford rashness or righteousness, and fury even less.\n“If there is evidence against my wife…” Leo spoke the words slowly\nand precisely. “The nation must judge her. I agree to your terms.”\nThere was a long, nervous silence. Then Judge started to laugh. “Oh,\nYoung Lion, that’s beautiful.” She slapped her tattooed thigh. “Love can\nbring folk together in fair weather, but it won’t bind ’em when the chill sets\nin. Hate’s better, in my experience. A common enemy gets folk moving\ntogether. But enemies get beaten, and put behind you, like the Breakers beat\nthe king, like the magi beat Kanedias, and then what happens? Folk get\nused to enemies. They always need more. They turn on each other.”\nSomeone had wandered in from the room next door. A short, heavyset\nman wearing a vest and nothing else. “Wha’ fuck?” he muttered, squinting\ninto the daylight.\n“Put some bloody clothes on, you animal.” Judge’s eyes flickered back\nto Leo. “Love and hate, they’re luxuries. Poets might say they’re from the\nheart, but I say no. They’re lies we tell ourselves. They’re choices made.\nBut fear,” and she lifted her trembling fist, “that’s an instinct. Fear and lust\nand hunger, they’re universal. The lowest insects have ’em. Fear is in the\ngut. It’s in the bones. It’s in the balls and the arse and the cunt.

The\npeople don’t need love or hate, Young Lion, but they always have to fear.\nBear that in mind.”\nLeo thought it over, and nodded. “Sage advice,” he said, and he didn’t\neven have to lie. “So…” With an effort he lifted his good foot, used the heel\nto slide some rubbish out of the way and propped it on the stained table\nbeside Judge’s. “Shall I put my riding boot on?”\n“At once if not sooner, General Brock! The Young Lion, back in the\nsaddle!” And she threw her arms up, and one of the two men at the window\ngave a brief round of applause. “Here’s the irony! On behalf of\nthe king we’ve got a commoner who was made a lord marshal, and on\nbehalf of the people we’ve got a lord governor who made himself a\ncommoner. Life can be horrible,” she said, jabbing her thumb at dead\nJuvens. “But life can be delightful, too,” pointing up at Kanedias and his\nsea of fire. “There’s its real beauty, eh? In its range. Daresay you’ve an old\nuniform lying about somewhere. Might need to take it in around the knee, I\nsuppose.”\n“The Representatives will agree to it?”\n“Well, I haven’t noticed anyone disagreeing with me lately. Have you?”\nJudge jerked her head towards the man with the broken nose. “Sparks?\nYou’ll be going along.”\nHe looked as unhappy about it as Leo felt, but he hid it a lot less well.\n“Me?”\n“Are you fucking disagreeing?”\nBroad shifted, his free fist clenching, and Sparks took a cautious step\nback. “’Course not, Judge. ’Course not.”\n“He’ll be, what d’you call it? A conduit, between you and the Purity\nOfficers. Keep everyone nice and loyal and pointed the same way.”\n“No doubt he’ll be a huge help.” Leo gritted his teeth as he rocked his\nweight back, then shoved himself to his feet, the ache in his stump turning\nsharp again.\n“I’ll send him along after. Once we’ve had a little word. Burners’\nbusiness, you know.”\n“I’m sure he can catch me up.” Leo tapped his false leg with his cane. “I\ndon’t walk too quickly these days.”\n“I wouldn’t want to intrude into the manly business o’ war, but one word\nof advice, General, before you ride to glory.” Judge let her head drop back,\nlooking at him down her nose. “Don’t lose. Now someone rub my fucking\nfeet! Or start there, at any rate, and work upwards!”\nThe horrible voices seemed to have stopped, at least, as Leo limped back\ntowards the steps. Except for the crying one. That softly went on.\nGlaward hurried up beside him, hissing, “She wants to put Savine on\ntrial—”\nLeo tossed down his cane and caught the big man by the jacket, lurching\ninto him and pinning him against the wall. “Do you think I fucking missed\nthat?”\n“I can warn her—”"

As though he’d never quite seen Leo\nuntil that moment and didn’t like the look of him now he did. “But…\nyour children—”\nLeo shoved him back again, hissing through gritted teeth. “If Savine\nruns, Judge will know we broke the deal and it will all be over. She has to\ntrust me. Trust me enough, anyway. That’s the only way this has a chance\nof working.”\n“He’s right,” said Jurand, softly, pushing Leo’s cane against his chest\nand using it to lever him away from Glaward. “There’s no choice.” He saw\nit right off, of course. He’d never been sentimental.\n“Savine wanted this,” snapped Leo. “She should’ve known where it\nmight lead.” He snatched his cane from Jurand’s hand and lurched off down\nthe stairway again, the scraping of his iron foot on the marble echoing from\nthe gilded ceiling. “Should I have said no?” He jerked his chin towards the\nslogan at the bottom of the steps. “Should I have told Judge fuck yourself?\nWe’d all have been in the dock together before sundown.”\nBehind him, Jurand took a long breath. “We all might end up there yet.”\nThis Half-Arsed Conspiracy\nV\nick picked her way down the street, a mass of slushy footprints, black-\nstained snow gathered in the gutters and against the doorsteps. She went\nagainst the crowd, as always, and thought about everything that could go\nwrong.\nShe’d flung a wide net when she scraped this half-arsed conspiracy\ntogether. She’d had to, to give it any chance of working. It had closed\naround some of the last people she’d have trusted. Savine Brock—as\nruthless a schemer as you could hope never to be in business with. Her\nhusband Leo—whose recklessness had already wrecked one attempt at\ntreachery. Corporal Tunny—a legend in the husk-dens and gambling houses\nfor his big mouth and small courage. His sidekick Yolk—who from her\nbrief acquaintance appeared to be one of the stupidest men in\ncreation. Then there was the lynchpin of the whole business, King Orso\n—born with a silver spoon so far up his arse you could see the end when he\nyawned. Vick’s best hope was that his valet could stop him making a fatal\nblunder—a fourteen-year-old he’d hired while she was working as a\nlaundry girl in a brothel.\nThe one person she actually trusted was Tallow, and he was the one\nperson she’d made sure to keep entirely out of it.\nAll those hard-learned lessons from the camps. All the painstaking risks\nand calculations. All the lies she’d told to make sure she stayed on the\nwinning side.

She’d been worried\nhe was following. Now she was sure. There was something in the way he\nstood that she didn’t like at all. Slightly hunched around his left side. As if\nhe was trying to hide a weapon that was too big to conceal.\nTempers were short in the market. Stocks were low and dwindling,\nprices high and climbing. A beefy labourer was arguing with the\nfishmonger, feet planted wide and finger stabbing. Vick slipped up through\nthe crowd and, in passing, slid her hand between the labourer’s legs from\nbehind and gently cupped his balls. He spun around, but by then she was\nconsidering the second-hand cutlery on the next stall.\n“What the—”\nThe labourer grabbed the nearest man, started snarling in his face. Vick\ndropped and slithered under a wagon, darting through the press bent double,\ngripping her bad hip tight to stop it aching, folk all straining up on tiptoe to\nsee the blazing row behind. She slipped through the doorway of a pawnshop\nshe knew, which had another door at the far side onto the Middleway. She\nnodded to the clerk as he frowned at her over his cracked eye-lenses, pulled\nher collar up against the cold and joined the hunched crowds shuffling\nsouth.\nIt was busy in the tavern. Noisy with idle chatter and hot with wasted\nbreath, the windows misted so the street outside became a sparkling blur.\nOne of those places where rich young men gather to pretend to be poor\nyoung men, and vomit up whatever point of view they last heard. One of\nthose places where rich young men once brayed for a Great Change, and\nnow drank hard and hoped desperately it would go away again.\nShe’d made sure she was early but her contact was there ahead of her. A\nnondescript fellow with a sprig of holly on his lapel, an empty glass and a\nplate of unappetising sausages in front of him.\n“Inspector Teufel.”\n“And you are?”\n“An employee of Chancellor Sotorius of Sipani.” Though he spoke with\nno accent at all.\nShe slid into the chair opposite. “Were you followed?”\n“No. Were you?”\nShe glanced about the room without seeming to, but there was no sign of\nthe big man who’d been following her. Just a plump woman in an expensive\nhat splashed red, reading a poem about the horrors of watching one’s\nchildren starve. “No.”\n“Good. You should try these.” And he slid his plate across towards her,\nbreathing the words. “A gift from Princess Carlot.”\n“Looks good,” she lied, and drew the plate close so the packet\nunderneath it dropped into her lap. She took a bite from one of the sausages.\n“And it tastes as good as it looks.” That, at least, was no lie. But those\neating were the lucky ones. Food that tasted good was a true extravagance\nthese days."

Now the houses\nyawned empty—blackened rafters, scorched windows, glimpses\nof charred wreckage through the broken doorways.\nQuiet here. That soft, muffled silence that comes with snow. A few sets\nof tracks, from people taking refuge in the ruins, or doing dark business of\none kind or another, but they’d partly filled up with the most recent fall. She\nstomped a dozen clear bootprints into the white then backed up quick,\nplanting her feet in the tracks so she made no more. She gathered herself,\nthen sprang sideways into a dripping doorway, pressing her back against the\nscorched plaster. She made herself silent, made herself small, and waited.\nShe could’ve slipped away.

The\nwaiting for a man in the shadows with a stick and a clenched jaw. She heard\nhim coming. Heavy footsteps, crunching in the snow. He saw the prints. A\nmuttered curse. Then he strode past the doorway, head down, following the\ntrail. His hand was in his coat, she thought. On the hilt of a weapon, maybe,\nand she gripped her stick tighter, and slipped from the doorway.\nHis back was still to her, but he was even bigger than she’d thought. A\nterribly sturdy look to his shoulders. No way she could risk giving him any\nchances. Hit first, hard as you can. Chances after.\nHer heart was thudding in her ears as she crept up behind him. He’d\nreached the end of the trail, was casting about, trying to work out what had\nhappened. She took one more careful step towards him, then winced at a\ntwinge in that bloody hip of hers. Snow crunched faintly under her boot as\nshe raised the stick.\nHis head whipped around, a glimpse of his grey-bearded face, the corner\nof an eye.\nShe bared her teeth as she swung for the side of his knee, but at the last\nmoment he lifted his leg and it caught the meat of his calf with a dull\nsmack. He didn’t go down. He didn’t even cry out. A little grunt, maybe,\nand a stumble sideways. As he turned, she’d set herself and was already\nbringing the stick down, overhand, with all the strength she had.\nHe jerked his head to the side and the stick thudded into his shoulder. He\ndidn’t even grunt this time. Just took a half-step back. She swung again but\nhe caught it on one forearm, brushed it off and came at her so fast she\nbarely even saw it, let alone got out of the way.\nVick had been hit plenty. But she’d never been hit so hard.\nShe folded up like a paper bag, stick tumbling from her numb fingers,\nand she was on her knees in the snow with her jaw hanging open and a\nstring of spit dangling from her lip, making a kind of helpless wheeze with\nher arms clutched around her and great jolting waves of pain throbbing\nfrom the side of her stomach.\nShe’d a knife in her boot. But she couldn’t move. She couldn’t even\nbreathe.\nHe squatted down in front of her, but she couldn’t see anything higher\nthan his knees.\n“Inspector Teufel? The king’s servant told me to find you.”\nThere was no mistaking that high little voice. It was Bremer dan Gorst.\n“There’s no one else here?” he asked as she shouldered the door open.\nShe almost laughed, but even that sent a flash of pain through her side.\n“No. There’s no one else here.” Her last guest had been Tallow. When she\npaid him for betraying his friends. She glanced at Gorst. “Ever feel like you\nmade some bad choices?”\nHe didn’t answer. Somehow, she took that for a yes. She limped down\nthe hall, so narrow he had to turn his great shoulders slightly sideways to fit."

She limped down\nthe hall, so narrow he had to turn his great shoulders slightly sideways to fit.\nDamn, the place was cold. Felt colder inside than out. She eased herself\ndown beside the little table in the little dining room, fumbled out those\nmatches she’d bought and lit the stub of candle. She sat back gripping her\nside.\nGorst stood in the doorway, faint light chiselling shadows into his slab\nof a face. “Does it hurt?”\n“Only when I breathe.” She’d a suspicion he’d cracked a rib or two.\n“Didn’t hurt you, did I?”\nHe put her stick down carefully on the table and shook his head.\n“You could pretend, couldn’t you, for the sake of my pride?”\n“You’re joking?” He said it as an honest question. As if he couldn’t\nreally have told the difference.\n“I’m trying. Guess we all like to think we’re tougher than we are.\nHaving the illusion shattered is never pleasant.” She waved a hand towards\nthe empty cupboards, a couple of the doors still broken from when the\nBreakers first stormed the Agriont. “I’d offer you something, but… I don’t\nhave anything.”\nShe looked around the room as if seeing it through new eyes. If the place\nwhere you lived was a glimpse into your life, then hers could hardly have\nbeen emptier. The dusty squares board that was never played with. The\ndusty books that were never read. Apart from Sibalt’s well-thumbed copy of\nThe Life of Dab Sweet, maybe. But looking at one picture over and over\nwhile you think about everything you’ve thrown away hardly counts.\n“Not really used to having guests,” she muttered.\n“Nor I to being one.” Gorst pushed back his hood. Vick remembered\nhim with his whole head rigorously shaved. Now he had grey thatch around\nthe sides and a wispy tuft on top. He looked more like an oversized lawyer\nthan a swordsman. “Corporal Tunny was hiding me in his…”\n“Knocking shop?”\n“The Burners visited. I was obliged to climb out of the window.”\n“Must have bigger windows than I’d have expected.”\n“It was a squeeze.” Gorst gave a puzzled frown. “I stand accused of\nbeing a royalist.”\n“Well, you did lead the Knights of the Body for two kings. Don’t get\nmuch more royalist than that.”\n“And you?”\n“I did dirty work for two Arch Lectors, I suppose. I grew up in the\ncamps…” She sat with her mouth open a moment, wondering where to go\nwith that. “You learn to stand with the winners.”\n“Then what brings you to the losing side?”\nIt was a good question. A woman who’d suffered more than most under\nthe old regime. Who’d had her childhood and her youth and her family\nstolen by it. No one should’ve rejoiced in its fall more than her. But here\nshe was, risking her life to restore it.\n“I’ve seen enough folk thrown off the Tower of Chains. And I quite like\nKing Orso.” A strange thing for her to say.

And his hand on hers, in a room under the House of Questions.\nWas that all it took, to win her devotion? Maybe Glokta had been right. She\nreally was desperate for something to be loyal to. “You can stay here for\nnow. Doubt they’ll be looking for you a few hundred strides from the Court\nof the People. And they’ve plenty of others to chase. Seems to me they\ndon’t care much who they execute as long as there’s a queue.”\n“What were you doing,” he asked, “in that tavern?”\n“Don’t trust me?”\nHe said nothing. She supposed where the king’s safety was concerned, a\nFirst Guard trusts no one.\n“I was getting these.” She winced as she pulled the packet out from\nbehind her belt and slipped it onto the table. “Jewels. From the king’s sister,\nin Sipani. We’re going to use them to buy the city gates.”\n“Greed still works?”\nShe snorted. “People are still people—”\nThere was a heavy knock at the door.\nVick met Gorst’s eye and put a finger to her lips. A pointless gesture,\nsince he barely spoke anyway. He pressed himself to the wall and silently\nslid out his short steel, a forearm’s length of immaculately polished metal\ncatching the candlelight.\nSo those dozen Burners she’d been expecting had done the clever thing\nand waited for her to get home before paying a visit. She grimaced as she\nbent down and slid the knife from her boot, holding it out of sight behind\nher arm.\n“Coming!” she called breezily as she strolled down the hall, while her\nheart thudded in her ears. She tried to pull the door open as if she was guilty\nof nothing and had no broken ribs, then felt a giddy rush of relief, then a\ngiddy rush of pain as she breathed in too hard. “What is it, Tallow? I’ve got\ncompany.”\nHe stood there in the chilly dusk, staring up at her. “Hadn’t heard from\nyou in a day or two. I was worried. Then, you know, I heard voices—”\n“And the only reason a man would darken my door is to kill me, is it?”\nShe shifted to block the doorway. Not hard to do. It wasn’t a big doorway.\n“We’ve all got needs, Tallow.”\nHe looked first surprised, then slightly disturbed, by the idea that she\nmight have needs. “Oh. Right.”\n“I appreciate your concern.”\nHe stood staring at her.\nShe wafted her fingers off into the night. “You can go.” And she\nshouldered the door shut.\nShe leaned against the wall for a moment, holding her side and breathing\ncarefully, not too shallow, not too deep. Then she walked back down the\nhall, slipped around Gorst and over to the window, twitched the shutter\nback a chink to make sure Tallow was on his way.\n“You don’t trust him?” muttered Gorst.\n“I don’t trust anyone.”\nIt was easier to tell herself that, somehow, than to admit she didn’t want\nto put him in danger.

She watched him trudge off hunched through the\nsnow, until he was lost around the corner. Damn, he was like her brother.\nShe glanced at Gorst, a slit of faint light down his lined face, a slice of\nscraggy beard and a wisp of greasy hair over his forehead.\n“So the two of us are the great hope?” She held her side as she lowered\nherself gingerly back into her chair. “Fates help the Union.”\nA Spicy Denunciation\n“T\nhe state of these,” murmured Orso as he was herded past the new\nstatues on what used to be the Kingsway. The freezing weather, and now the\nsoggy thaw, had not been kind to them. The nose of one of the giant nursing\nmothers had already dropped off, broken lumps of it scattered about her\npedestal. There were some troubling cracks in her bust besides. Probably\nthat would drop off next, braining some unfortunate passer-by. Crushed by\ngiant tits. It was the way Tunny had always wanted to go.\n“Risinau brought some sculptor over from Styria to remake them,” said\nHildi, frowning up, “but she was tossed off the Tower of Chains along with\nhim. So they got some masons to do it.”\n“Oh. Yes.” He vaguely remembered that being discussed by the\nRepresentatives before court one day. Some young firebrand from the\nprovinces frothing up a fury. “An actual sculptor would have been an\naristocratic indulgence. There is no task beyond the skill of a proud working\nman of the Union!” He puffed out his cheeks. “By the Fates, they can’t even\ndestroy things well.”\n“You’re saying you miss the old ones?” asked Hildi.\nOrso opened his mouth to answer, then paused. As with so many things\nthese days, he had hopelessly mixed feelings. Lord Hoff had once referred\nto the statues on the Kingsway as the Union’s greatest treasure. A\ncelebration of all that was most noble. A true wonder of the world, if\npatriotic swagger was your fetish.\nExcept they had also, of course, been a total pack of lies. A parade of\nself-serving arrogance in which Orso would one day have taken his place,\nwhere rapacious torturers were celebrated for their compassion, vengeful\nwarmongers praised for their forbearance, heedless do-nothings eulogised\nfor their painstaking care. As if to set the tone for this shameless distortion\nof history, Bayaz, the world’s most shameless thief, had been literally raised\nup on a pedestal at both ends for all that he had given the Union.\n“Which do you prefer?” asked Orso, with a shrug. “Grand lies or ugly\ntruths?”\n“Reckon we might be better off with neither,” muttered Hildi.\nOrso had even more mixed feelings about the changes to the Square of\nMarshals. He tried to keep his chin up and walk with that careless swagger\nthat so annoyed his many guards, but could not seem to prevent his eyes\nfrom drifting down. Could not help reading the names carved into the\nflagstones where a parade in his honour once ended. Here and there, melted"

Could not help reading the names carved into the\nflagstones where a parade in his honour once ended. Here and there, melted\nmounds of candle stubs, and decaying wreaths, and sodden letters of\ngratitude had built up, impromptu shrines around the names of the most\nadmired martyrs. So many names. Thousands upon thousands, and each one\na person dead so that he could sit on a golden chair and seem to be in\npower.\nPerhaps fortunately, perhaps not, his attention was soon claimed by the\njeering. Winter had drastically reduced the size of the crowds before the\nCourt of the People, but the fanatics that remained made up for it by sheer\nweight of anger, pressing in around the guards, shaking pamphlets and\nyelling insults.\nOrso smiled, waved, blew kisses, as he always did. “Too kind, my\nsubjects! To turn out in the cold, for me? Too kind!” A sneering woman spat\non him, and he clutched it to his stained jacket like a bouquet. “I shall\ntreasure it!”\n“Long live the king!” came a scream.\n“Oh no,” said Hildi.\nSomeone had clambered up on one of the broken pedestals near the\nsteps of the court. A flash of the golden sun of the Union on a piece of cloth,\nfrantically waved. Rage flashed through the mob. “Long live the—” Cut off\nin a squawk as he was dragged down. A surge as people struggled to get\nclose enough to participate in the beating.\nThis kind of thing was becoming more and more common. Were these\nspur-of-the-moment royalists lunatics? Simpletons? Suicidal? Or had the\ndisappointments of the Great Change simply piled on them so heavily it\ninduced a kind of mania? Orso was grateful for any support, but could they\nnot support him silently? Open demonstrations of monarchism did no one\nany good. Least of all the monarch himself.\nIn her last message, Teufel had told him that plans were in place. That he\nshould be ready. That it might be a matter of days. He had to smother a\nsurge of nerves at the thought. He leaned close to Hildi to whisper, “I think\nJudge is going to put me on trial soon.”\n“You’ve been saying that for weeks.”\n“It’s getting dangerous.”\n“You’ve been saying that for weeks.”\n“And I’ve been right. Hildi, I mean it, this would be an excellent\nmoment for you to abandon me.”\nShe dropped her voice even further, murmuring through tight lips. “Your\nfriends will come through.”\nOrso caught a glimpse of his latest supporter dragged past insensible,\nblood in his hair. One of the guards aimed a lazy kick at him. The crowd\nhad fallen on the old flag like wolves on a carcass and were trampling each\nother in their eagerness to trample it. Corporal Halder surveyed the scene\nwith an air of bored detachment, hands on hips.\n“I still hope they will,” muttered Orso, “but, being realistic—”\n“When have you ever done that?”\n“—the chances of failure are very high.” The closer the day came,\nindeed, the higher the chances of failure seemed. “The consequences of"

        "text": "“When have you ever done that?”\n“—the chances of failure are very high.” The closer the day came,\nindeed, the higher the chances of failure seemed. “The consequences of\nfailure…” It was hardly worth spelling them out. He spent every waking\nmoment powerlessly turning them over, after all, and every sleeping\nmoment\ndreaming about them. “If they don’t come through—”\n“You’ll know about it when you hear me denouncing you to the Court of\nthe People.”\nOrso smiled. “That’s my girl. Make it a spicy denunciation, though,\nwon’t you? None of these droning lists of names we get these days. I want it\noverflowing with scandal, shocks and low moral character.”\n“Oh, it’ll be a real firecracker,” said Hildi. “I’ll make ’em shit in the\ngalleries.”\n“Maybe stop short of that. The place smells bad enough as it is.”\n“Let’s go,” grunted Halder, nudging Orso up the steps to the Court of the\nPeople. There had been a time when access to the royal person was\ngoverned by a book of rules four fingers thick. Now any fool could poke\nhim with impunity.\nJudge was getting comfortable in the high chair as Orso was\nmanhandled into the sovereign’s cage, but there was a gap on the front\nbenches where Citizen Brock and his Anglanders would usually have been\npreening themselves. Orso rather hoped they might have been spicily\ndenounced and dragged off to the House of Purity themselves, but that was\nprobably too much luck to hope for. Luck had really not been falling his\nway the past couple of decades.\n“Silence in the court!” And the murmur of voices dropped away as\nSworbreck strode forwards. He had acquired a blood-red suit of clothes\nnow, having been appointed Chief Prosecutor for the Great Change. Since\nthe proceedings were less about law than consolatory fantasy and cheap\nmelodrama, no doubt the writer was uniquely qualified.\n“After weeks of painstaking investigation,” he shrieked, meaning a night\nspent hauling the latest crop of unfortunates from their beds at random, “the\nloyal servants of the Great Change,” meaning the drunken, drugged and\nmurder-addicted Burners, “have ripped a most sinister conspiracy up by the\nroots and into the light of justice!”\nAlways new conspiracies. Always the most sinister. Ever more\nelaborate, fiendish, impossible to disprove. Intrigues that somehow involved\nStyrians, Gurkish and Northmen all at once. Schemes that required the\nenemies of the Great Change to be inscrutable puppet masters and utter\nidiots simultaneously. Orso wondered what would happen when they had\nkilled everyone. Would Judge try herself last of all in the empty Court of the\nPeople, sentence herself to death and fling herself from the Tower of\nChains? He gave an entirely inappropriate splutter of laughter at the\nthought. The shame was he would not live to see it, having been pulped in\nthe dry moat years before. Unless his friend at the House of Purity came\nthrough sooner rather than later…\nHis eyes flickered to the latest wretched group being herded to the dock\nby Captain Broad, and he sat bolt upright.\nMost prisoners strove to appear humble.

It was hard not to after a few\ndays with meagre food and no bath, in some chilly corner of the Agriont\nhastily converted into cells. But the woman at the back of this trio had done\nthe exact opposite, costumed as if for the Summer Contest at the height of\nthe old regime, all piled red wig, dramatic black silk and bosomy flounce.\n“Selest dan Heugen,” murmured Orso. He knew the woman was\nnobody’s fool. So why had she dressed as the villain of this particular\npantomime? She stood proudly in the dock, in defiance of the boos, catcalls\nand obscene suggestions from the public galleries, but there was a waxy\npallor of fear under her over-heavy blush. She glanced at Judge, and the\nringleader of this demented circus grinned back as she propped her dirty\nfeet on the High Table and nodded at her prosecutor to get the righteous\nwork underway.\n“Henrik Jost!” Sworbreck roared at the first prisoner, a portly man with a\ndouble chin and a patched waistcoat. “You stand accused of grand usury\nand conspiracy! Have you anything to say?”\nThe man struggled up, looking punch-drunk, a large bruise above his\neye. “I admit to serving for a dozen years as a senior lending clerk at the\nBanking House of Valint and Balk—” Hisses from above. “But it was\nconsidered a respectable trade, entirely respectable! I arranged loans for\nworthy enterprises. Mills and manufactories the breadth of Midderland.\nEstablishments that gave employment to many—”\n“Including businesses and establishments,” hissed Sworbreck, as though\nthey were the worst excesses of witchcraft, “owned by this woman, Selest\nHeugen?”\nA chorus of boos. Some rotten piece of vegetable matter tumbled from\nabove and sprayed juice across the tiles. The banker stared at Selest. She\nstared back, breathing hard through flared nostrils. “Well… yes, but in those\ndays, no one thought of it as a crime—”\n“Time’s no shield from punishment,” growled Judge. “Guilty!”\nJost was about to protest, but Sarlby leaned over the dock to cuff him\nacross the head and knock him back into his seat. Sworbreck had already\nswaggered to the next prisoner, a trembly man with a nimbus of wild hair,\nhis eyes bloodshot behind cracked lenses.\n“Piater Norlhorm, you stand accused of disloyal pronouncements,\nroyalist sympathies and conspiracy to incite riot! Have you anything to\nsay?”\n“Absolutely!” He sprang up, waving a fistful of flapping papers,\nscrawled on both sides. “I have established a watertight defence!” Grumbles\nfrom the galleries as he perched his lenses on his wispy pate and began\nrummaging through his mismatched pages. “I fear there was some damage\ncaused by damp during the last search of my cell…”\n“I thought it was watertight?” some wag called from the upper gallery.\nLaughter.\n“Ah, yes!” The old man cleared his throat, puffing up his chest to read"

He\nmissed his seat and sprawled on the floor, paper bags, candle-wrappers and\nscribbled-on sheet music drifting about him.\n“Selest dan Heugen!” snapped Sworbreck. She rose, an ill-looking\nblotchiness across her collarbones, but her fists clenched like those of a\nprizefighter about to enter the ring. “You stand accused of profiteering,\nspeculation, exploitation and conspiracy.” Charges vague enough to be\nimpossible to prove or disprove, as they always were. “Have you anything\nto—”\n“I wish to make denunciations!” she blurted, as though desperate to get\nin before she missed her chance. She did not even bother to protest her\ninnocence. In that, she was probably wise. Innocence was wasted on the\ncourt these days.\nJudge hungrily licked her lips. “By all means.”\nSelest spilled names like a broken cask spills wine. Her entire\nacquaintance came out in a burbling rush. Several Orso knew had already\nbeen executed. Tears began to trickle down her face, leaving black powder\ntracks all the way to her spit-flecked lips. She denounced friends, partners,\nfamily members. Boras Heugen, her cousin, shrivelled into his seat with\ncharacteristic cowardice. It came as no surprise these days, of course. Orso\nhad seen courage in that dock, and inspiring camaraderie, and towering\ndignity. He had also seen brothers denounce their sisters, wives denounce\ntheir husbands, parents denounce their children.\nJudge started to frown. She shifted impatiently in her chair. She curled\nher lip and reached for her hammer.\n“I denounce Savine Brock!” screeched Selest.\nOrso felt as if his guts had suddenly fallen out of his arse. And he was\nnot the only one on whom the name fell heavily. There was no cheer. Only a\ndisbelieving mutter. The ex-noblemen looked grim. This was an attack on\ntheir leader. An attack on them. And Savine had made herself popular,\nrecently, at the other end of the social scale. She had fed people, clothed\npeople, brought them fuel in the bleak winter when the Burners had brought\nthem nothing but corpses.\nSworbreck glanced worriedly over at Judge, but Judge waved him\neagerly on. “Of what do you accuse her?”"

That she conspired with her father, Arch Lector Glokta!\nThat she conspired with bankers, Gurkish agents and Styrian spies!” Selest\nlifted a trembling finger to point straight at Orso. “It is a fact that she\nconspired with the king!”\nHe stared back in shocked upset. “Everyone knows she bloody\nconspired against me!”\n“Then why did you spare her and her husband the noose?” shrieked\nSelest. It was a good question. One to which Orso had himself struggled to\nfind a satisfactory answer. Selest was less circumspect. “Because it is a fact\nthat Savine Brock was for years the king’s lover!”\nOrso sat back frowning on his stool as the whispers fluttered about the\npublic galleries. That one was harder to deny with much conviction. They\nwere memories he still often guiltily caught himself enjoying, after all.\n“Not only that! It is a fact!” Selest spat the word with a kind of savage\ntriumph. “That Savine Brock is the king’s sister!”\nOrso felt the colour drain from his face. Probably he should have lied his\nhead off. That was what everybody else did in here. But he was taken too\nmuch by surprise. Everyone was.\n“It is a fact!” Selest was screaming now, spit flying, broken voice\nechoing. “That Savine Brock is the bastard daughter of King Jezal the\nFirst!”\nThere was a breathless silence in the court as people struggled to make\nsense of what they were hearing. The Representatives sat gawping on their\nbenches. The public galleries gave a collective gasp. Captain Broad stood,\nflask frozen just short of his mouth. Judge sat bolt upright in her chair,\nmouth twisted into a delighted grin.\nIn her last message, Teufel had told him that it might be a matter of\ndays.\nIt looked as if days might be too long.\n“Now that,” breathed Hildi, “is a spicy denunciation.”\nPurity\n“P\nurity Officers of the People’s Army!” called Leo.\nA hundred of the bastards, their clothes and armour spattered with red.\nTwo from each company.

I fought\nthe king at Stoffenbeck—”\n“And fucking lost,” someone growled. Murmurs of agreement. Leo felt\nGlaward shifting unhappily at his shoulder.\n“Aye, I lost!” he called. “I was rash. I was reckless. I was vain. It cost\nme two of my best friends, not to mention an arm and a leg.” He tapped at\nthe metal one with his cane. “But I learned my lesson. I learn it fresh every\ntime I try to hold one of my babies, climb the stairs or pull my prick out to\npiss.” Some grudging nods there. Most of them were veterans. They might\nnot respect much, but they respected wounds, and they respected swearing.\n“I used to be quite the hero! And quite the fucking fool.

He always knew\njust what Leo needed. Leaving him in Angland had been the worst mistake\nof all. One he’d never make again.\nLeo puffed out his chest like he used to, when he gave his speeches\nto the Army of Angland. “With me in charge, there’ll be no more\ncompromises. No more half-measures. No more defeats.” Some of the arms\nwere coming unfolded. Some of the frowns were fading. “I know you’ve\nbeen short of food and supplies, gone without pay for weeks. I’ll put that\nright first.” The grunts had turned appreciative. Even fanatics like being\npaid. “But I understand why you might not accept me! I was a nobleman.\nNow I’m a fucking cripple.” He grinned and dug out a couple of grim\nlaughs. “I won’t force myself on you, whether Judge picked me or not. But\nI won’t fight you over every decision, either. I mean to lead. So I need your\nconsent, now, to be led. I’ll give you some time to discuss it, but when I\ncome back I want a straight answer.”\nA big man with a beard stained red spoke up. “Young Lion, I think I\nspeak for us all when I say—”\nLeo held up his hand. “Discuss it! Take a vote if you need to. I don’t\nwant to hear later you weren’t given the chance.” He tapped Sparks’s\nshoulder with the handle of his cane. “Citizen Sparks will make sure you’re\nall heard.” And before anyone could disagree, he turned and limped out of\nthe barn into the morning chill, hearing the doors creak as they were swung\nshut behind him."

It felt better than he’d ever expected, to be back in\nuniform and in charge of soldiers again, even if the uniform scarcely fit him\nand the soldiers were a pack of scum.\nWhen he left Angland his mother had warned him he was no general. He\nsaw now how right she’d been. Rash and indecisive at once, and so horribly\nsentimental. Losing everything, and seeing his friends dead before his eyes,\nand months of pain ever since had cured him of all that. Perhaps he had half\nthe limbs, but he reckoned he was twice the man he used to be. He’d a\nharder head, a harder heart and, most important of all, a far stronger\nstomach.\n“Generals are forged in the fires of defeat,” he murmured to himself.\nStolicus, maybe? He wondered what his mother would say now.\n“Not having second thoughts, are you?” asked Jurand, stepping up\nbeside him.\n“You know me.” Leo gave a grunt as he shifted his weight on his iron\nleg. “I barely even have first thoughts.”\n“Once, maybe. Not any more.” And Jurand grinned at him. By the dead,\nthat smile. Leo could’ve looked at it all day.\nHe could hear the raised voices from the barn. The Burners and the\nBreakers always loved a debate. An argument. A vote. The noisier and more\ntedious the better. How much of that nonsense had he endured in the ruined\nLords’ Round?\n“Which side do you think they’ll come down on?” he asked.\nJurand looked almost puzzled. “What does it matter?”\n“Just curious, I suppose. I mean, we all want to be liked.” Leo winced as\nhe turned and waved to the dark-uniformed Anglanders gathered about the\nbarn. Quietly, carefully, men slipped forward. They slid a beam into the\nbrackets, barring the doors from outside. Others sloshed oil over the lower\ntimbers of the barn. More came forwards with torches, touched them to the\nwood and fire bloomed. In a few moments the flames were licking high, all\naround, right to the eaves of the roof. Leo heard shouting inside, over the\ncrackle and roar. The doors wobbled, clattered.\nLeo’s men had dropped their torches, now they drew swords and readied\nflatbows. “Surround the barn!” he called. “Kill anyone who makes it out.”\n“Yes, Your Grace.”\n“Glaward, put loyal Anglanders wherever there were Purity Officers\nbefore. Jurand, see the People’s Army fed and paid with what Savine gave\nyou. When the time comes, I want them loyal. Loyal enough, anyway.”\nOver the roar of flames, Leo could just hear the wails of horror.\nAlongside the stink of burning, it reminded him more than a little of"

He’d been conceived on a battlefield. He’d been reborn on\nanother. He took a wary step back, narrowing his eyes against the heat, and\nwatched the smoke pour up into the dawn sky.\n“I guess it had to be done,” said Glaward, wide eyes flickering with\nreflected flames.\n“They love the fire,” said Leo, tugging his jacket smooth, then turning\naway. “They can have the fire.”\nNone of the Cards\n“C\nalder’s coming!” roared the messenger, skittering to a halt in the\nmiddle of Skarling’s Hall and nearly going over on his arse.\n“By the dead,” someone breathed.\nRikke felt a flutter in her stomach. Fear and doubt, of course, those\nfamiliar friends of hers, but excitement, too. So strong she couldn’t quite\nkeep the smile off her face. She glanced over at Corleth. “Looks like the\nweather didn’t put him off after all.”\nThe messenger was halfway sick from running and he coughed, spat,\nthen blurted out more in gulping rushes. “He’s no more’n… a day or two\ndistant. Strung out on the bad roads, but… lot o’ men. Mighty host.\nThousands! And a swarm o’ bastards from past the Crinna, too. Some\nfucker rides on a wagon of bones. Stand-i’-the-Barrows, they call him.”\nThere was a murmur in Skarling’s Hall. Fear and doubt, of course, but…\nactually just fear and doubt. From a set of bastards who’d been tigers every\nman not a few months back, when they dragged Stour Nightfall into the hall\non his ruined knees. She remembered her father telling her, All warriors are\nbrave when they’re sure of victory. Amazing how few stay brave when the\nnumbers are against ’em and the hopes look thin.\n“They’re burning every farm they find,” blathered the messenger, “and\nskinning the folk there, and taking their bones!”\n“Their bones?” someone muttered, face all twisted with sick shock.\n“They’re the things that keep you standing,” growled Rikke. “We could\ndo with a few more in here, I reckon. Shivers, send scouts into the hills,\nkeep a watch on Calder and his men. Make sure we get no more surprises.\nAnd spread word in the valleys round about. Don’t want this Barrows\nbastard killing anyone we can save with a warning. Tell any friends Black\nCalder’s on his way, and they should be ready.”\n“Aye,” said Shivers, simply. No hint of fear on his scarred face as he\npicked a few men out and sent ’em scampering for the doors. He didn’t\nknow what fear was. Or if he did, he’d buried his so deep no one would\never catch a glimpse of it. Rikke took courage from that, though her heart\nwas thumping so hard she worried Black Calder might hear it, even a day or\ntwo away.\nCorleth leaned close to Skarling’s Chair. “They’re still a ways off.

Had to keep grinning,\nhowever her stomach bubbled and her skin prickled and her hands wanted\nto shake. “I ran from Black Calder once and it was no fun at all. Promised\nmyself I’d never do it again.”\n“We’re staying, then?” grunted one of the warriors, looking like that\nwouldn’t have been his first choice.\nShivers raised his one brow at Rikke.\n“We’re staying,” she said to Shivers.\n“We’re staying,” Shivers pronounced to the room.\n“But we got none o’ the cards!” someone called. Meaning, Rikke\ngathered, that she’d thrown ’em all away. “The Nail’s gone, and\nHardbread’s gone, and Isern-i-Phail’s gone—”\n“Calder’s got the numbers,” growled a fellow with a gravelly voice but a\nfearful pallor. “Might have the numbers ten to one.”\n“He might have the numbers,” said Rikke, “but we’ve got the walls.”\n“But if those Crinna bastards get inside ’em there’ll be no mercy—”\n“Hoping for mercy from your enemies is a piss-weak way to start a\nfight!” She jumped up from Skarling’s Chair and sneered at ’em down her\nnose. “I shouldn’t have to explain that to you lot. You’re meant to make ’em\nhope for mercy from you! Look at you, clucking and fussing while the\nwomen can’t wait to fight!” And she waved a hand at Corleth, who looked,\nin fact, like she had some sizeable doubts about the whole notion. “Tell you\nwhat, Corleth, bring your granny up here to the hall, where it’s safe. Safer,\nanyway!” And she hacked out a laugh. A bit of fearlessness was what they\nneeded to see from her now. Maybe it’d be catching.\nCorleth stared. “Reckon she’d be happier in her house—”\n“Better sad and alive, though. Shivers’ll help you.” Rikke was already\nstrolling over to Stour’s cage. “And we’ve still got a card or two left to\nplay.” There sat the used-to-be terror of the North, his eyes gleaming in the\nshadows, one limp leg hanging through the bars so his toes near brushed the\nstone.\n“Your daddy loves you, eh?” she sang. “Ain’t a thing he wouldn’t give\nfor you. Even Carleon.”\nThat pallid warrior’s colour had only got worse. “Maybe Black Calder’ll\nmake a deal. But d’you really think he’ll stick to it once you give this\nbastard over?”\nStour put a thin hand on the bars and pulled himself into the light,\nmaking the chain creak. First time she’d seen that sharp-toothed, wet-eyed\nsmile in a while and it gave her a most unpleasant feeling to add to her\nnerves. Folk are rarely made better by suffering, after all.

Once he got free\nof that cage, chances were he’d be a worse terror than ever. “You should\nrun,” he whispered. “You should run now, and never stop.”\nRikke felt a shiver through her shoulders, but she turned it into a\ncareless shrug. “I’m minded to stay. We’re all back to the mud one way or\nanother. Only a question of how. And when. Far as that goes…” And she\ngrinned as she tapped at her cheek, where the runes were. “Maybe I know\nsomething you don’t.”\nHorror on Horror\n“F\ninally, you show yourself,” Clover grunted at the sun, “you coy\nbastard.”\nIt was good to feel its warmth on his face, finally. Like an old friend,\nmuch missed. Like Wonderful, in that regard. He couldn’t help wincing at\nthe thought. She wouldn’t be back. His knife had made sure of that. As for\nthe sun, it had turned up too late to help much.\nA couple of weeks of marching and Black Calder’s carefully stitched-\ntogether host was coming apart at the seams. Men sick. Men hungry. Men\nfrozen and frostbitten. Men sleepless and exhausted. Men so filth-caked\nthey looked like devils, white eyes staring haunted from dirt-grey faces.\nPlenty more chosen to turn their backs on this boggy nightmare and run, in\nspite of the deserters strung from trees by the road and carved with the\nbloody cross, flyblown guts dangling. Scouts stared into their fires rather\nthan at the far hills. Carls fretted more on warmth than weapons. The only\nenemy on anyone’s mind was the mud, against whom no victory could be\nwon, a great trail of discarded gear, mired wagons, dead horses, not to\nmention dead men left abandoned across the boot-mashed country behind\nthem.\nNot far from the jealously guarded patch of grass on which Clover and\nhis people had got a lick of fire going, a column cursed through the swampy\nmorass in the valley’s bottom, spears wobbling at all angles like the prickles\nof a hedgehog, a filthy standard slumping from a filthy pole. There’d been a\nroad under that slop once, Clover thought, a thing now dimly remembered,\na fantastical story once heard, like dry boots, warmth and unchafed fruits.\n“I’m starting to think…” murmured Flick as he added a couple of damp\nsticks to the fire with wincing care, “that war ain’t half the fun it’s made out\nto be.”\n“It’s worth all the effort,” grunted Downside, “when you get a good\nbattle.”\n“Good… battle.” Sholla held her hands so close to the flames it was only\nthe stubborn damp in their rag-wrappings stopped ’em catching fire. “Not\nsure those two words belong next to one another.”\n“A bit like saying it’s worth the weeks of slow death to enjoy an hour or\ntwo’s furious murder.” Clover tried to pull his bedraggled wolfskin collar\nup higher, but there was no hiding from the keen wind knifing down the\nvalley sides, still with the odd patch of melting snow splattered on ’em."

But the new Chief of a Hundred Tribes was a\ncolourless man, with whirls of grey scar cut into his hollow cheeks, thick\nveins showing in the skull-like rings under his eyes in which you almost\nthought you could see the blood pulse.\nHe sat swaying in the wagon’s seat as its wheels ground through the\nrutted mud, calm and easy as a farmer on his turnip cart. Trouble was, his\ncargo wasn’t turnips but bones. Heaps of ’em, boiled bare, white and\nyellow. The four horses that drew it were covered head to hoof in bones,\nmade devil-steeds, their eyes showing wild through split horse skulls, bones\ndangling from their tattered manes, woven into their tails. The man himself\nhad tiny bones stitched to his armour in strange designs. Finger bones.\nChildren’s finger bones, maybe.\n“Bones is the theme, I reckon,” muttered Sholla.\n“One to which he has committed,” said Flick, wider-eyed than ever.\nA wretched group were dragged after, chained to the wagon’s seat by\ncollars around their necks. Boys and girls, men and women, half-naked and\nspattered with filth to their hair, beaten and bloody, stumbling and slipping.\nThey sent up a miserable music of moans to which the clunking of the\nwagon’s soiled axles was the percussion.\n“Will you look at this fucking pantomime,” muttered Clover, as if\nanyone could’ve looked away. He was a hard man to disgust, but this\nspectacle had managed it.\nA crowd of spiked and scarred and war-painted savages trotted behind,\nwith their jagged weapons and their strange standards and their pierced\nfaces, eyes rolling in ecstasy at the thought of the blood to be spilled. There\nwere dogs with them, great dogs straining at iron-toothed leads, cruel dogs\ntreated cruelly, big as wolves and far meaner, teeth filed to points, snarling\nand snapping at whoever was fool enough to stray near.\nCarls and Thralls scrambled from the path of this visitation from hell—\nor beyond the Crinna, which was about the same thing—with various\nexpressions of grim hate, shock, fear, outrage and disgust.\nDownside noisily hawked up phlegm and spat roughly in the savages’\ndirection. “It’s arseholes like this give the North a bad name.”\n“For once we agree,” said Sholla.\nStand-i’-the-Barrows reined in his bone-covered horses, not moved one\nbit by the disgust of his supposed allies, and Clover saw Black Calder\nnudge his own black mount up beside the wagon. You expected a jagged\nhowl to rip from that ghost-pale corpse face. It was almost worse to hear an\nordinary sort of voice, saying ordinary sorts of things."

It was almost worse to hear an\nordinary sort of voice, saying ordinary sorts of things.\n“Black Calder, my friend. Good to see the sun. It may dry things up.”\n“We can hope,” said Calder, voice a little tight. “The scouts are looking\ndown on Carleon, just over those hills.” He squinted up at the clouds\nshifting. “Reckon there’ll be a battle tomorrow.”\n“Lovely.” Stand-i’-the-Barrows’ colourless eyes were fixed on the\nhorizon. “I still have empty wagons and Bayaz told me you would help me\nfill them. Should we stop for dinner soon?” He turned around to talk to one\nof his slaves. “What do we have for dinner?”\nHer split lips moved. She whispered something.\nStand-i’-the-Barrows caught her chain from the bunch and dragged her\ntowards him so sharply, the corner of the cart dug into her shoulder and she\nwas knocked down in the mud. He wound the chain around his fist, hauling\nher bruised face up towards his, her bare toes scraping at the ground. “Did\nyou not hear me? I asked what’s for dinner.”\nShe had her fingers squeezed into her collar, skin all white around it\nfrom the pressure. “Mutton,” she gasped out.\nStand-i’-the-Barrows let her drop and she knelt in the mud, spitting and\ngasping. “I like mutton. We will have a nice gravy with it, too.” He\nsmacked his lips. “I insist always on a good gravy.”\n“It makes the meat,” muttered Calder, watching the girl scramble back to\nthe rest of the slaves.\n“Do you like mutton, Black Calder? Will you join me for mutton and\ngravy later?”\n“Other business, sadly. Have to get the men ready.”\n“You’re all work! A man must make time for fun. But still.” Stand-i’-\nthe-\nBarrows laughed a high, good-humoured laugh. “More mutton for me!”\nAnd he snapped his reins, and sent his wagon o’ nightmares rattling on.\n“Y’ever feel,” murmured Flick as he watched the slaves dragged after,\nbouncing off each other, clutching at their collars, sending up a chorus of\nsobs, “that you’re on the wrong side o’ the question?”\n“Increasingly.” Clover scratched gently at his scar. “Whichever side I\npick.”\n“I mean…” Flick was looking down at himself, patting his chest as if\npicturing a costume like Stand-i’-the-Barrows wore. “Why cover yourself\nwith bones?”\n“’Cause being feared is a heady brew,” muttered Downside, who was\nbringing out his whetstone for his favourite hobby of sharpening his axe.\n“Men get drunk on it.”\n“First fear’s their weapon.” Clover remembered winning a few fights\nbefore they began, using just a hard stare and the weight of his name. “Then\nit becomes their shield.

An early grave.”\n“Enough to make you miss the Bloody-Nine. He might’ve killed more\nmen than winter, but he never made some fucking travelling show out of\nit.”\n“The sad truth is, men love to follow a man other men fear,” said Clover.\n“Makes them feel fearsome, too.

By\nthe dead, had he once been that way?\n“Why hasn’t she run?” he muttered, frowning towards the hills. He\nthought of Rikke, perched in Skarling’s Chair with that knowing smile. That\nbig black eye with the runes around it, the pupil yawning like a pit full of\nsecrets. “What’s she seen, with that Long Eye of hers?”\nHe gave a shiver. A cloud had come across the sun again and cast the\nmuddy valley into shadow.\nThe Dragon’s Hoard\nI\nt was cold, but the lethal sting was off the air. The snow was melting fast,\nchill water dripping from the eaves, filthy tracks of stomped-up slush down\nthe pavements, dirty slop gurgling in the gutters. The queues were already\nlong outside the bakery and the coal merchant, bundled-up Citizens ready to\nfight to the death for whatever had leaked into the city overnight. At the\nstreet corner a district crier cheerfully called out the names of yesterday’s\ndenounced. Most likely he’d be at it a while.\n“They found the manager, then?” Tallow gave a long sniff as he looked\nup at the bank. Before the Great Change, Valint and Balk had towered over\nevery scrap of business done in the Union, an untouchable colossus. Now\nthe marble skin had been stripped from the pillars of its headquarters to\nshow the cheap bricks beneath, the word Usurers slopped in red paint a\nthousand thousand times, all over the ruined façade.\nThe banking hall had been picked clean. Chill and empty but for broken\nfurniture, torn papers, two or three dozen frowning Constables and dust."

Chill and empty but for broken\nfurniture, torn papers, two or three dozen frowning Constables and dust.\nCommissioner Pike stood gazing up at the giant vault door, its brass wheel,\nits two tiny keyholes, no more than a few bright scratches on its black\nsurface for all the efforts of the People’s Inspectorate to get inside.\n“You found the manager, then?” asked Vick.\nPike glanced over as she strode up. “Thanks to your efforts, in fact.\nOnce that cellar in the Three Farms was shut down there was no one to\nbring him food. An old woman heard him singing and alerted the\nauthorities.”\n“Singing?”\n“He had bricked himself into a secret space between two slum tenements\nowned by the bank. He had been hiding there for weeks.” Almost as\nuncomfortable as having Bremer dan Gorst wedged into her tiny apartment,\nshe imagined. “He appears to have gone quite mad.”\nVick resisted the urge to ask who hadn’t.\n“But he did have this.” Pike held up a long steel key and offered her\nanother. The one the senior over-clerk for loans had given her the day she\nbroke into the bank with an unloaded cannon. “Perhaps you might help me\ndo the honours?”\nShe looked up at the towering door, feeling the need for something more\nmomentous than the turning of a little rod of metal. But that’s how locks\nopen. She slid the key into one of the keyholes and looked across at Pike as\nhe did the same.\n“On three,” she said, “I suppose.”\n“Whyever not? One, two, three.” They turned the keys together with a\ngentle click. “Constable?”\nThe biggest man to hand gripped the wheel, dipped his shoulder and\nbegan to turn it. There was a whirring of well-oiled gears, then an\nanswering clatter, faint, from within, and the door began to edge smoothly\nopen.\nVick had never been that interested in money. But even she couldn’t\nhelp a shiver at the thought of what might be beyond that mighty thickness\nof steel. Her imagination spun out heaps of gleaming coins, chests of\ngemstones, jewelled swords, ivory drinking horns. Incense and pearls, silks\nand resins, too, why not? Sculpted relics of the Old Empire, lost works by\nAropella, deeds to whole countries, the Master Maker’s private diaries. The\nplunder of a barbarian army and the profits of a city of merchant princes\ncombined.\nOnce the gap was wide enough to slip through it became an effort not to\nstart forward. But Pike waited, with epic patience, as the vast weight of\nsteel inched towards them, and past, and the vault of the Adua headquarters\nof Valint and Balk finally stood open.\nIt wasn’t that big. A room slightly wider than the great door itself, lined\nfloor to ceiling with shelves. And on the shelves, as Vick stepped after Pike,\nthrough the vast doorway and into the heavy silence beyond, eyes gradually\nadjusting to the gloom…\nNothing.\nIt was entirely bare.\nVick had faced some disappointments, but she wasn’t sure she’d ever\nexperienced so intense an anticlimax."

Sealed up in here, it might’ve taken\nyears to form. Decades. “If there was ever any here.”\n“The power of Valint and Balk comes down to an empty vault.” Pike\nsounded almost impressed. “Just promises, just lies, just…”\n“Nothing,” said Vick.\nPike had started making a sort of gurgling wheeze. At first, she thought\nhe might be choking. She was on the point of calling for help when she\nrealised it was laughter. Of all the unexpected things she had seen since the\nGreat Change, its chief instigator laughing his arse out in Valint and Balk’s\nempty vault might’ve been the strangest.\nHe straightened, with a final shiver of mirth, dabbing his running eyes.\n“Ah, dear me. A vast fortune in gold would certainly have been helpful.”\n“It usually is,” said Vick, her mind on the bribes she’d already arranged\nwith Princess Cathil’s jewels, and the ones she still had to engineer.\n“But… all this really changes is the timing,” Pike was saying. “How is\nyour conspiracy coming along, by the way?”\nFor a giddy moment, it didn’t quite register. Vick stood there with the\npuzzled frown of someone who sees blood squirting but hasn’t yet realised\nit’s their own throat that’s slit.\nHer first instinct, once she picked back through his words and gathered\ntheir meaning, was to run. Her second to fight. A habit from the camps. Her\neyes darted to the vault door. Her fingers twitched to her weapons. But the\nplace was crawling with Constables. She wouldn’t make it five strides. And\nwith that certainty came an odd calm. She’d always expected to be found\nout. Every moment she wasn’t had been coming as a surprise. She closed\nher eyes and took a breath.\nWould they kill her here, on the spot, her body found floating by the\ndocks as her old master Arch Lector Glokta had been so fond of saying?\nWould they drag her off to the House of Purity for questioning, then the\nCourt of the People for judgement, then the Tower of Chains for the long\ndrop? Or would Pike make an exception in her case, for irony’s sake, and\nsend her back to the camps in Angland?\n“Tallow had nothing to do with it,” she said. A mistake, of course.\nBreaking all her own rules yet again. She might as well have torn her shirt\nopen and pointed out the exact position of her heart. But it was a mistake\nshe couldn’t help making. As if she wanted, at the end, to have done one\nthing worth doing.\n“You like the boy, don’t you?” Pike’s face was a mask again. “There’s\nno shame in liking someone. I like you, in fact. Far more than most. To put\nboth Brocks and King Orso together in one scheme? Ambitious, to combine\nsuch volatile ingredients. Reckless, even. Not at all what I expected. You"

That sad little\nsmile, in the half-light of the foundry, before the end. “But the time\ncomes…” She supposed she could allow herself a little flourish. “You have\nto stand up.”\n“Yes.” Pike’s burned lips curled back from his teeth. “There is the lesson\nthe camps taught me.” He turned from the empty shelves to consider her,\nand took a long breath through his nose, and let it sigh away. Then he gave\na neat little nod. “Proceed.”\nThere was a heavy silence in the vault. A muffled banging from\nsomewhere behind, where the Constables must have found something still\nworth smashing. Again, it took a moment for Vick to catch up. Then she\ngently cleared her throat. “What?”\n“The Great Change has done its work.”\n“Its work?”\n“A wise man once told me that sometimes… to change the world…\nwe must first burn it down. But Judge is a fire out of control. The time\nhas come to douse the flames and restore order, before everything is\nreduced to ashes.”\n“So…” The silence stretched between them. “Proceed?”\n“Exactly. I wish I could offer you help beyond turning a blind eye, but I\nfear, under the present circumstances, there is no one in the Inspectorate\nthat I fully trust. No one but you, of course, Inspector.” Pike turned back to\nconsider the empty shelves, clasping his hands behind him. “It really has\nbecome almost impossible, these days, to tell where people stand.”\nVick stood and stared at him for a long moment. “You don’t fucking\nsay,” she muttered.\nOutside in the chilly street the snow was still melting. The queues still\nstretching. The crier still busy with his list of doomed names.\n“You look pleased,” said Tallow, still hugging himself. “Must’ve been a\nlot o’ money in that vault.”\nA rare smile was forming on Vick’s face. “It was empty.”\nShe wasn’t sure how it had happened, but she was starting to think they\nhad a chance. If Pike was with them, or at least not against them. If Lord\nMarshal Forest and the Young Lion could do their part without killing each\nother. If Bremer dan Gorst could stay out of sight. If King Orso could keep\nhis mouth shut. If they could avoid disasters for only a few more days, they\nhad a chance.\n“And finally!” roared the crier with a parting flourish. “Accused of\nprofiteering and speculation, exploitation and grand usury, betrayal of the\nGreat Change, royalism and incest… Citizeness Savine Brock!”\nVick’s smile was gone as quickly as it had come.\n“Fuck,” she whispered.\nNone Saved\n“I\nshould caution you,” said Citizeness Vallimir, pausing at the front door,\n“it can be rather… overwhelming.” She wore a sober black dress and\nstained apron. Hardly recognisable as the fussy hostess Savine had dined\nwith in Valbeck. But who had come through the Great Change quite the\nsame?"

But who had come through the Great Change quite the\nsame?\n“Believe me, it could be rather overwhelming when my parents were…\nstill in residence…” Savine trailed off as she crossed the threshold.\nJokes did not feel appropriate.\nThe hallway was full of children. Crowded with them, down both sides.\nRagged. Scabbed. Filthy. Five or six haggard nurses stood among them,\nlooking hardly better. Savine’s mother had insisted on fresh flowers here,\nevery day. There were no flowers now. Someone had taken away the\nchandelier, and the place smelled stale. Savine forced a queasy smile onto\nher face. Nodded a greeting at no one in particular. She heard Zuri take a\nsharp breath, as unsettling from her as a scream of horror might have been\nfrom someone else.\n“Children, this is Citizeness Brock! This is her house. It is thanks to her\ngenerosity that you have food and shelter—”\n“That’s all right,” said Savine. “Really.” She realised the strange carpet\nof rags the children were standing on were their blankets, wedged in left\nand right to leave a narrow path of scuffed floor to walk down. “Do they\nsleep here?” she muttered, flinching away from the great dark eyes of a girl\nwho would not, could not, stop staring. They were like a bird’s eyes,\nunblinking.\n“We need the space.” Citizeness Vallimir pushed open the door to the\nroom where Savine had once drunk with her mother, laughed with her\nmother, been sick with horror at the secret her mother had told her. The\nwindows were mostly boarded up, and it took a moment for her eyes to\nadjust to the gloom.\nShe had allowed herself to imagine neat files of clean, grateful, pretty\norphans. Saved orphans. The sight of those in the hall had shocked her.\nNow she realised they had been the presentable ones.\nThe children crowded into the bare room were like some other species.\nTwisted, stunted, wounded, strange. Shafts of dusty light fell on ugly\ndetails. A great bloom of scabs on a hollow ribcage. A hunched shape,\nendlessly rocking. Mouths gaped and dribbled. Flies buzzed about leaking\neyes. Some of them slumped, insensible. Some of them crouched, baring\nblackened teeth. They were thin as stray cats. They were mad as mean dogs.\nOne girl had puke in her hair. One boy’s face was a mass of sores. Another\nstared at the peeling wallpaper, slapping the side of his own half-bald head\nover and over. They made strange noises. Not words, exactly. Warbles and\nwheezes and snarls. Like an abandoned menagerie in which the animals had\nall gone mad.\nWhen Savine looked into those ranks of hungry faces, it was no sappy\ndesire to hold them and stroke their hair that rose up but a trapped panic. An\nurge to run, barging children out of her way. The challenge of each of her\nown two babies was almost more than she could manage. How could\nanyone satisfy the scale of the need in this room, let alone this house?"

How could\nanyone satisfy the scale of the need in this room, let alone this house?\n“By the Fates,” she whispered, unable to stop herself putting a hand over\nher mouth at the overpowering stink.\n“You forget, once you’re used to it,” said Citizeness Vallimir. “We do\nour best to keep them clean, to contain the sickness and the lice, but there\nare too few of us, no soap to be had, no spare fuel to heat water. We keep\nthe younger children downstairs, the older ones upstairs.” She glanced\ntowards the great staircase in the hall—down which Savine used to sweep,\nin the giddy height of fashion—as if she was a general frowning into no\nman’s land. “They are more… malevolent. They form gangs. They prey on\neach other. At night… well. One must be careful here at night.”\n“How many do you have?” whispered Savine, staring about her\nmother’s old salon. It made her think of the mill in Valbeck, where children\nonce toiled for her profit.\n“Honestly… I couldn’t say. We kept records to begin with, where we\ncould. Names, birthplaces, ages, but… once we realised what was\nhappening in the city…” She gave a helpless sigh. “The children band\ntogether and huddle anywhere warm. Then they are in terrible danger. They\nare hunted, rounded up like sheep. They are bought and sold. Traded into\nslavery in the mills. Pressed into… worse kinds of slavery. They started to\ncome here by themselves. Soon there were dozens of them crowding about\nthe gate every morning. We were less interested in counting them than in\ngetting them out of the cold, feeding them, and then…” She hopelessly\nraised her hands, hopelessly let them fall, eloquently conveying the size of\nthe challenge.\nSavine felt Zuri’s reassuring touch on her shoulder. “You have done\ngood here. All the good you could. Never forget that.”\nIt was hard for Savine to imagine, at that moment, that she had done\nanything more than concentrate the most intense misery into one place. She\nforced the hand away from her mouth, forced down her panic and tried to\nthink through it, like any other problem. She had been expecting challenges\nof education, occupation, betterment. Having taken a few steps over the\nthreshold, it was clear no one was looking past survival. “You need money,\nfor food, fuel, clothing.” She had given the last of what she had to Leo so he\ncould bribe the People’s Army. “If I am to go to the government…” If there\nwas anything left still worthy of the title. “Or find some wealthy\nbenefactor…” Though those who had money were hoarding it to hide\nbehind. “I need at least some idea of how many we have.”\n“I will try to make a count.” Zuri slipped her pencil from behind her ear,\nwagging it at each child as she made a quick circuit of the room, each flick\nof its point a whole life to be rebuilt, from the ground up. Even counting\nthem was no easy task. There were some wretched bunks, three high, but\ntheir blankets were crammed onto every available patch of floor as well,\nstuffed into every corner."

There were some wretched bunks, three high, but\ntheir blankets were crammed onto every available patch of floor as well,\nstuffed into every corner.\n“It gets worse each day,” said Citizeness Vallimir as Zuri slipped from\nthe room to continue the tally. Savine felt faint at the thought of the whole\nhouse like this, from cellars to attic. “Those orphaned, abandoned, those\nwho have found their way to the city from hopeless conditions in the\ncountry. The stories they tell… things no child should have to hear of, let\nalone suffer.” She lowered her voice to a whisper, eyes darting sideways\nas though worried she might be overheard. “And with the executions…\nthere are no provisions made for the children of those who fall from the\nTower of Chains—”\nThere was a crash in the hall and Savine jerked around. Another crash,\nsplintering, raised voices.\n“Whatever is that?” asked Citizeness Vallimir.\nSavine closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She already knew.\nBurners were tramping through the shattered front door, their armour\nspattered with red paint, pushing children out of their way, squeals of fear\nspreading through the house. They were already stomping up the stairs,\ngetting their pikes hopelessly tangled with the banisters. They were\neverywhere.\nSo it seemed Judge would finally have a genuine conspiracy to expose\nbefore the Court of the People. Teufel had been caught, or Orso had talked,\nor Leo had failed. While Savine was thinking that all was lost, she was also\nthinking that pikes were an absurd weapon for a confined space, and she felt\ntears in her eyes and almost giggled at once.\nCitizeness Vallimir drew herself up. “What is the meaning of—”\n“It’s all right,” said Savine, easing her aside. She appreciated the\ngesture, but it could not do the slightest good. “I expect they are here for\nme.”\n“Got it in one,” said a sinewy Burner with a red handprint on his\nbreastplate and a broad grin on his face. The grin of a polite tradesman, here\nwith a much-anticipated delivery. “My name’s Sarlby.”\n“I remember. From the barricades in Valbeck.”\nHe gave a disbelieving laugh, then. “You’re the girl who lived with the\nBroads! Well I never. Hey, Bull, it’s—”\n“I know who it is.” The floor creaked as Broad stepped into the hall. He\nhad grown a scruffy beard and there was something crusted at the corners of\nhis mouth. Savine remembered his first visit to this house, with Liddy and\nMay, hunched and overawed. He stood tall now, bridge of his nose creased\nin permanent rage, the menace that he had once tried to hide, that she had\ncoaxed out to use against her striking workers, put on savage display. The\nchildren inside the door frame shrank away into the corners. It was the most\nSavine could do not to shrink away, too.\nSarlby held up a smudged document. “Citizeness Brock, you’ve been\ndenounced—quite fucking spectacularly, as it happens—and are summoned\nto the House o’ Purity to await trial.”"

All bosoms. Didn’t catch her name—”\n“Heugen,” grunted Broad.\nSelest. Not Teufel, then. Not Orso. Had she simply been caught up in the\nordinary, merciless grind of the Court of the People? What a bitter joke it\nwould be, if she was brought down not by a wide-ranging plot to betray the\nGreat Change, but by an old feud with a jealous rival. Savine swallowed,\nher mind racing. Then Leo might still be free. Their schemes might still be\nmoving forward.\n“Citizeness Vallimir,” she murmured, “I would be very grateful if you\ncould get a message to my husband—”\n“Oh, the Young Lion knows all about it,” said Sarlby, pulling out a set of\nheavy chains, polished bright about the bracelets with use. “Done a deal wi’\nJudge, I understand. Bull was there, weren’t you? What was the phrase he\nused?”\nThe light flashed on Broad’s eye-lenses. “The nation must judge her.”\nSavine could only stand, staring, as Sarlby snapped the manacles shut\naround her limp wrists. As quickly as it had flared up, hope was smothered.\nHad her own husband turned on her? Or had he done what he had to, to gain\ncontrol of the People’s Army? She hardly recognised him any more. Hardly\nknew what he might do from one moment to the next.\n“Don’t worry,” said Sarlby, giving her shoulder a reassuring pat. “You\nwon’t have to wait long. You’ve been bumped right up the schedule.\nFriends in high places, eh?”\nOr enemies. The weight of the chains, the coldness of them, had\nsomehow taken Savine’s breath away. She wondered how many others had\nworn this very set. She wondered if any of them were still alive. The\nreasons for your conviction in the Court of the People made little difference\nto the sentence, after all. The fall was still the fall.\n“Citizeness Vallimir,” she managed to say, “might I beg a favour? Bring\nmy children to me at the House of Purity. They are in danger, do you\nunderstand?” Her voice was getting higher and higher as she thought of\nthem, helpless in their cots with only a nurse. “They have to stay with me.”\n“Doubt that’ll work,” said Sarlby, rattling the bracelets on her wrists to\nmake sure they were locked tight.\n“She wants to bring her children.” Broad took off his lenses, and\nbreathed on them, and started to polish them with his shirt-cuff. His eyes\nrolled up to Savine’s, red-rimmed and bloodshot. He looked as if he hardly\nknew her. “She can bring her children.”\nThere was a clattering above, the Burners bundling someone down the\nstairs. “We’ve got her!” one shouted in triumph.

Savine realised with a\nlurch of horror that their prisoner was Zuri, wrists and ankles shackled with\ngreat black fetters, links a finger thick. She could hardly move for their\nweight.\n“For pity’s sake!” called Savine. “Do you need those chains?”\n“Can’t take chances,” said Sarlby as they dragged Zuri roughly to her\nfeet at the bottom of the stairs. “Could be an Eater.”\nHer hair had come loose, and she gave Savine the briefest look through\nthe black tangle across her face. “Do not worry about me, it—”\n“Shut your mouth, you brown bitch.” One of the Burners tore the silver\nwatch from around Zuri’s neck, the chain catching her ear and making her\ngasp, gave an approving grunt and slipped it into his pocket. Another pulled\nher head back and started to strap some contraption of buckles and wire\nover her face. By the Fates, they were muzzling her.\n“Are you mad?” shrieked Savine. She regretted it at once. Quite\nobviously they were all mad. “She’s a lady’s companion, not a sorceress!\nYou know her, Gunnar.”\nBroad winced, as if the sound of his first name was painful. “Not up to\nme,” he grunted, and he lifted a flask and took a little sip. “Up to the court.”\n“How many suspected Eaters have you arrested?” asked Savine as they\ndragged Zuri towards the door, kicking through the children’s bedding.\n“Dozens,” said Sarlby.\nShe clasped her hands, her own chain rattling. “And how many have\nactually been Eaters?”\n“Once they’re chained and muzzled, what difference does it make? She\nhas brothers, does she?”\n“But they’re… good people,” whispered Savine. What a pointless thing\nto say. She stared at the orphans, cringing against the peeling walls. How\nfoolish she had been, to think she could save anyone. She could not even\nsave herself.\nSarlby took her under the arm and walked her towards the door. “It’s a\nshame, but there’s not so many turning up for the executions any more,” he\nwas saying, as if they were discussing the weather. “Bored of ’em, I guess.\nIf there’s one human ability I’ve always been amazed by, it’s the capacity to\nget bored. Saw it in Styria. Saw it in Valbeck. Don’t matter how mad,\nstrange or outrageous, folk’ll get bored of anything. Don’t worry, though.\nGiven who your father is… or your fathers were… I’m sure there’ll be no\nshortage of interest.” He gave her a wink as he brought her through the door\nof the house where she had dreamed of being queen and out into the chill\nair. “And we still get a good turnout for the pretty ones.”\nThe Same Side\nL\neo had a trick for putting a shirt on. He needed a trick for most things\nthese days. First, he gathered the sleeve and twisted it over his useless hand.\nThe arm had withered. Thin, soft, pale apart from the scattered pink\nscars.

His left hand looked strange, now.\nThe nails had a purplish tint. Old skin flaking from the numb fingertips.\nLike the hand of a corpse, and about as useful.\nHe clenched his jaw, worked the sleeve up his numb arm to his shoulder,\nthen whipped his right hand around behind his head—collar sliding\nbetween finger and thumb—and into the other armhole with a snapping of\ncloth, smooth as a step in a dance.\nHe had a trick for it. But these days Leo needed a trick for anything\nmore complicated than turning a doorknob.\nJurand ducked through the tent-flap. “They’re here. The royalists.”\nLeo raised his brows as he shoved the tails of his shirt down behind his\nbelt. “Inspector Teufel has made us all royalists.”\n“They’re deploying on the other side of the valley.” Jurand pulled the\ngeneral’s jacket from the back of a folding chair and stepped over. He didn’t\nembarrass Leo by asking if he wanted help. He knew what was needed\nbefore he was told, just as he always had. “If you can call it deploying.”\nLeo let himself be handled like a mannequin by a tailor. Or a dead body\nby an undertaker. Perhaps the most important trick he had learned was\nswallowing his pride and taking whatever help he could get.\nJurand frowned down as he did up the buttons of Leo’s jacket, quick and\npractised as any valet. “Their men look almost as much of a mess as ours.\nAlmost. There were more desertions in the night.”\n“Not such a bad thing,” murmured Leo. “Weed out anyone with\ndoubts… about the new leadership…”\nJurand was so close Leo could smell him, leather and polish and\nhorsehair and soap. He could hear his slow breath. Could see each hair of\nhis long eyelashes, a tiny blemish on his cheek, his lips pressed together\nwith concentration, but that little curl at the corner that he always used to\nhave when they were together, before… everything that had happened.\nIt would’ve taken no effort at all to lean forwards and kiss him. It was\nalmost more effort not to do it. Leo wondered what the roughness of his\nfresh-shaved jaw would feel like against Leo’s cheek. What his hair would\nfeel like between Leo’s fingers. What his mouth would taste like—\nJurand looked up and their eyes met, and Leo froze, his breath held, his\nface tingling. “I… should have been there,” murmured Jurand. “At\nStoffenbeck. If I’d been there—”\n“I’m glad you weren’t. Glad you… weren’t hurt.” Leo thought of\nAntaup then, and Jin, and Bremer dan Gorst’s boots crunching across the\nruined square. “I can’t afford… to lose you.” And he tore his prickling eyes\naway, lifting his chin so Jurand could fasten his top button. “You’ll be there\nthis time,” he managed to say, his voice rough.\n“I’ll always be there.” Did Jurand reach gently for Leo’s useless hand, as"

Leo took it first and awkwardly stuffed it into\nthe gap in his jacket, turning to the mirror with a forced smile. “How do I\nlook?”\nJurand picked a speck of fluff from the braid on Leo’s chest and flicked\nit away. “As handsome as ever,” he said, softly.\n“Lord Marshal Forest!” called Leo as he rode up. He could still ride well, at\nleast, since the horse did most of the work. Gripping to the saddle made the\nstump of his leg ache, but he was damned if he’d let them strap him onto it.\nHe considered wedging the reins in his teeth, decided that might be a bit\ninformal, and tossed them over his saddle instead so he could hold out his\nhand, hoping his horse behaved.\nThe lord marshal, his uniform battle-stained, his scarred face weather-\nworn, his beard a grey riot, considered that hand with little enthusiasm and\nfinally reached out to take it in a strong grip. “Young Lion.”\n“It’s an honour to meet you. Really. Nothing teaches respect for a man\nlike losing a battle to him. I only saw you from a distance, holding that\nridge against Stour Nightfall. You just refused to be shifted. Quite a sight.”\n“So was that charge of yours,” said Forest, grudgingly. “However it\nended.”\n“I’m hoping for a happier outcome this time around,” said Leo.\n“Between you and me, I’m running out of limbs at quite a rate.”\nOne of Forest’s frowning aides had a Union battle flag, and Leo was\nsurprised at the bittersweet sting of nostalgia he felt at the sight of it, even\ndangling limp as a hanged man in the morning’s dewy chill. The blazing\nsun had been torn from the flagpoles of Adua, chiselled from the stonework,\nburned on cloth and paper a million times over. He wondered how many\nsolar dinner sets had been destroyed since the Great Change.\n“Corporal Tunny tells me we’re on the same side now,” said Forest.\n“Thanks to the good graces of Victarine dan Teufel.” Or at any rate her\nlow cunning.\n“Wasn’t long ago you fought against the king,” grunted Forest. “Now\nyou’re fighting for him?”\nLeo puffed out his cheeks as he looked up at that flag. “Honestly, I can\nhardly remember what the world was like, before.” He shifted his left arm\nin his jacket, tried to work the fingers, winced at the numb aches\nin his elbow. “I can hardly remember what it felt like not to be in pain.\nThe reasons I fought against you… if there even were any good ones…\nare burned off like morning mist.” He didn’t mention the chairs on the\nClosed Council he’d been offered. He’d got a lot better at judging what to\nsay. And what to leave out. “The Great Change has to be changed back, at\nleast some of the way, before the Union eats itself.

Your men look in pretty poor shape, though.”\nLeo twisted around to look up the long rise, to where the People’s Army\nwere drawn up across the road to Adua. They’d been an ill-disciplined mob\nwhen they descended on the capital and freed him from the House of\nQuestions. They were far worse now. It would’ve been flattery to call their\nlines ragged. There were scarcely any lines at all.\n“Terrible shape, poor bastards,” said Leo. “Hungry, tired, cold, poor.\nAbove all, they’re sick. Sick of fighting, sick of Judge, sick of the whole\nbloody business.” He turned back to Forest, grinning. “All in all, I’d say\nthey’re ready for the restoration of the monarchy.”\n“And they’ll follow you?” asked one of Forest’s aides.\n“They’ll follow anyone who feeds them,” said Jurand. “Especially if he\npoints them in the direction of home.”\n“We’ve weeded out the worst of the Burners,” said Leo, “and put loyal\nmen in their place. But the truth is they don’t want to fight any more.” He\nnodded towards Forest’s tattered companies, drawn up on the rise ahead, no\ntwo the same size. “By the look of things, your men feel much the same.”\nForest’s turn to twist in his saddle and frown towards his crooked lines.\nWhen he turned back, he suddenly looked his age, weary and grey. “Reckon\nthey might only have one more fight left in ’em.”\n“Then let’s make it a good one,” said Leo, turning his horse. “Glaward,\ngive the order! We’re marching for Adua!”\nBreak What They Love\nT\nhe sun shone bright on the gatehouse roof, but Rikke felt an edge on the\nwind as Black Calder’s army spread out around the walls of Carleon. Most\nlikely anyone feels a bit of a chill, though, watching thousands of men get\nready to kill you.\n“So here they are,” she murmured, lowering her eyeglass. “Looks like\nthey’ve had a muddy old time on the way. State o’ these bastards.”\nShivers slowly nodded. “But the number of ’em, too.” He’d made quite\nan effort for the battle, with his mail gleaming and his war-horn at his belt,\nhis grey hair bound back neat as a bride’s and his shield fresh-painted red\nwith the sign of the Long Eye, the black boss its yawning pupil.\n“Aye.” Rikke fumbled for a joke but couldn’t find one in easy reach.\nSpecially with her stomach trying to climb up out of her mouth and make a\nrun for it. More men and more kept spilling over the hills to the north,\nthrough the shadows crawling across the land from the fast-moving clouds\nabove, forming slovenly lines in the fields around the city where the last\npatches of snow clung pale and dirty in the hollows.\nNo doubt there were a lot of the bastards.

Her own men looked sparse on the walkways atop Carleon’s\nwalls. Nervous and lonely. Carls of Uffrith who’d served her father, far\nfrom home and with a leader who looked shakier every day.\nRikke had even less faith in her judgement than they did. She’d seen\nthings, up in the hills, when the witch tattooed the runes around her eye.\nSplinters and fragments. Enough to take a guess at what was coming. But\nnowhere near enough to be sure.\n“They’ve got ladders,” said Corleth, hair whipping about her clenched\njaw, standard of the Long Eye whipping above her.\n“Lot o’ ladders,” said Shivers.\n“Lot of everything,” said Rikke. “Let’s hope they don’t have cannons!”\nShe barked a laugh but nearly puked on it, had to awkwardly swallow an\nacrid little tickle in her throat. “They don’t have cannons, do they? What’re\nthose wagons?” She squinted through her eyeglass. “Are those… bones?”\n“That’ll be Stand-i’-the-Barrows. Those boys from past the Crinna\nalways had some funny notions. Stranger-Come-Knocking was wild for\nplumbing, as I recall.”\n“Well, who wants to die at the hands of a man with no hobbies?” Rikke\ntook a hard, cold breath and blew it out. One way or another, it’d get\nfinished today. The scores that began when Scale Ironhand invaded the\nProtectorate, all those months ago. Scores way older than that, even. When\nher father told Black Calder he’d cut the bloody cross in him at the Battle of\nOsrung. When Black Calder killed Forley the Weakest years before. When\nher father and the Bloody-Nine fought for Bethod, and then against him, all\nacross the North and back and left a trail of corpses both ways. One feud\ngrowing from another, blood flowing from blood, all settled today. Or\nmaybe it was folly to think so. Maybe it’d just be new feuds started.\n“I’m excited!” called Rikke, stretching up on tiptoes and forcing out a\ngrin, like she knew just what was coming even if she was bubbling over\nwith doubts. She clapped Corleth on the shoulder. She liked doing it. Her\nshoulders had a meaty, reassuring feel. “You excited?”\nCorleth swallowed. “Honestly, I’m shitting myself.”\n“Two ways of saying the same thing.” Rikke rubbed at her belly, tried to\nkick the aches out of her legs. “By the dead, that’s sore.”\n“You all right?”\n“Just the moon pains. Blood came last night.”\n“Huh. Me, too.”\n“Fancy that, our wombs have found a rhythm! Same thing happened\nwith Isern.” And Rikke gave a wistful sigh. “Reckon it’s time to get Stour\nout of his cage.”\n“Aye,” said Corleth, and she trotted to the steps.\nShivers was frowning out into the fields, sunlight glinting on his metal"

The city he’d ruled\nthe North from for twenty years. Had to hurt, having it stolen by a girl with\na magic eye. Had to hurt, having to beg for the life of his only son.\nBut then, you reach a certain age, everything hurts.\n“Clover,” he grunted, “I want you next to me.”\n“’Course, Chief. Though battlefields do give me a rash.”\n“We’ll all have to tolerate some discomforts today. Got a horse for you.”\n“Grand,” said Clover, with heavy sarcasm.\nHe’d owned a horse once, long time ago, but only ’cause it was the type\no’ thing folk expect a famous warrior to own. Didn’t think he’d ever ridden\nit. Except once, when he bought it, pretending he wasn’t scared witless he’d\nfall off, and only ’cause it was the type o’ thing folk expect someone to do\nwhen buying a horse. Rest of the time it just stood in a stable, looking sad,\neating his hay and costing him money. Strange, how much of his time he’d\nspent worrying about what people expect. You’d have thought the one\nupside of being a famous warrior was doing whatever you pleased.\n“We should attack,” said Stand-i’-the-Barrows, sitting in his bone-\ncovered armour on his bone-covered horse. “Attack, attack, sweep over\nthem, a black wave. Drive them into nothingness. Into hell.” That was\npretty much the full range of his strategy. “Let’s not faff with the talk\nbefore. The talk before is always lies and boasting. Waste of your time.\nWaste of my time. Some day I will die. I wish to gather as many bones as I\ncan first. They say the cities of the South go on for ever, people flooding\nthrough them like rivers. And all those people are full of bones. Every one\nof them.” He gave a dreamy smile. “I wish to visit those places.”\n“They have my son,” said Calder, still glaring at the city. “Once I have\nhim, you can have Carleon, and all the bones inside.”\nStand-i’-the-Barrows smiled wider. “That is acceptable.”\nClover glanced over at Sholla and found her staring back, unable to hide\nher horror. “You stay here wi’ Flick,” he muttered.\n“Chief, I—”\n“Stay here,” he said, looking her in the eye.\n“Don’t worry,” said Downside. “I’ll look after ’em.”\n“What a comfort.” Clover clambered up onto the horse he was\nborrowing. He found he liked it even less than he remembered. You forget\nhow bloody high horses are. And it turned all the way around while he was\nleaning down to grab the reins.\nBlack Calder was having his own troubles getting mounted.

He\nlooked weak when he got there, and grey, and grim. Not much left of the\nhandsome joker who nicked the North from under everyone’s noses. A man\nwho’d lasted past his time. A man dragged back for one fight too many.\nBut then, one is one too many.\nClover had a low feeling as he rode out towards Carleon. As he frowned\nto the left, towards the great mass of Crinna bastards working themselves\nup for the bone harvest. As he frowned to the right, watching Calder’s Carls\nbring their many-coloured shield-wall forward across the sun-splashed\nfields. As he frowned straight ahead, towards the black battlements above\nthe city’s gate. A feeling this’d all end badly.\nBut then, if you leave it long enough, what doesn’t end badly?\nRikke took a deep breath. By the dead, she needed to piss. She’d gone not\nlong ago, but now she felt like she was bursting. Wouldn’t look too clever,\nthat fearsome witch with the Long Eye, pissing herself on the battlements in\nfull view of her two worst enemies and a hostile army. Still, her da had\nalways said he near pissed himself in every fight. Hadn’t stopped him\nwinning most of his.\n“Here we go, then.” And she twisted her face into that knowing smile\nand swaggered up to the parapet. The very spot where the Bloody-Nine\nkilled Bethod. Might be the stones she propped her hands on were the ones\nthe first King of the Northmen got his brains smashed out on. She hoped the\nsignificance wasn’t lost on anyone as she leaned over, grinning down at the\ntwo-dozen riders before the gates.\nCalder’s sign was there, red circle on black, and other famous standards,\ntoo. She spotted Jonas Clover loitering near the back. He looked troubled,\nand Rikke hardly blamed him. He was in some troubling company. No\nmissing the bastards from beyond the Crinna. They were the ones with the\npaint and the bones. One in particular, grey-haired, grey-faced, grey eyes\nfixed on her, covered with bones head to toe, his helmet with the skull of\nsome great horned animal on it. And in front of him, on a black horse, a\nlean man with a sharp face and a fine black fur about his shoulders.\n“Black Calder!” she called. “Welcome back to Carleon!”\nHis mount was restless and he reined it savagely around, keeping his\nfrown fixed on her all the while. “Rikke o’ the Long Eye!”\nShe tapped at her face. “The only one I’ve got. Who’s your clown?”\n“Clown?”\n“The joker with all the bones.”\n“I am Stand-i’-the-Barrows, girl! Chieftain of a Hundred Tribes, lord of\nall the fen country from the Crinna to the sea, master of ten thousand\nspears! I am here to gather bones for my great barrow.

It is\na favoured pastime of mine.”\nThere was a silence, a cold wind blowing up, shaking the budding trees\nin the distance and sighing across the walls of Carleon. Rikke stuck her\nlittle finger in her ear, twisted it, pulled it out, examined the results and\nflicked them away. “Not very funny, is he?” she said.\n“I’m funnier,” said Shivers.\n“You’re funny ’cause no one expects laughs from a man with a metal\neye, though.” She waved down at Stand-i’-the-Barrows. “If you’re going to\nwear the motley you’d better be ready for fun! But let’s not drag this out,\nI’ve got my monthly bleed on and could do with changing my cloth. If\ngore’s your thing I can toss you down the old one.”\nStand-i’-the-Barrows curled back his lips to spit some answer but Calder\ngot in first. “Our mutual friend, Jonas Clover—”\n“I’m not sure Jonas Clover’s anyone’s friend but his own,” said Rikke.\nThe man in question gave a sheepish grin. “Just trying to get through the\nday is all.”\n“He tells me you’re willing to make a trade,” called Calder. “My son for\nhalf the North. That true?”\n“Could be.” Rikke leaned on the parapet, arms crossed, hands flopping,\nnecklace dangling, and cast an eye over all those men spreading out around\nCarleon. “But you brought an awful lot of friends through an awful lot of\nmud just so we could strike a bargain.”\n“My father always said, ‘Speak by all means, but the words of an armed\nman ring that much sweeter.’ Thought I’d make my words ring as sweetly\nas I could.”\n“They do say you were known for charming the ladies once. Bring the\nGreat Wolf where his da can see him!”\nShivers had Stour under one arm, holding him up and dragging him\nforwards at once, his hands tied behind him and his bare feet scuffing\nuselessly. He’d lost half his weight and all his pride, lips cracked, eyes\nsunken, squinting up at the sun like he’d never seen it before. Hadn’t been\nout of that cage in Skarling’s Hall for months, so the sky was coming as\nquite the shock to him.\n“Here he is!” called Rikke as Shivers hauled Stour up to the parapet\nwhere the whole valley could get a good look. “The grandson of Bethod!\nThe bane of Scale Ironhand! The King of the Northmen in all his glory!\nStour Nightfall!”\nAnd she thrust out an arm towards the ill-smelling cripple who was once\nthe terror of the North. There was a pause while those below took in the\nstate of him and wondered if it could truly be the same man.\nSeemed like there might be some damp glinting in Calder’s eyes, but\nmaybe it was the wind. “You all right, son?” he croaked out.\n“They cut my legs.” And there was a tearful whine in Stour’s voice that\nmade Rikke think of a child complaining over getting the smallest slice of"

I reckon he’s got off lightly.”\nEven at this distance she could see Calder grinding his teeth. “Carleon’s\nyours,” he growled. “Now cut him free and send him down.”\n“Well, I’ve got no more use for him.” Rikke snapped her fingers at\nShivers. “Daresay you’ve a knife, don’t you?”\n“You can never have too many.” He pulled one out, the work-polished\nhandle towards her. Not a big one. But a small blade can do the job, more\noften than not. “Sure you don’t want me to do it?” he asked, in that husky\nwhisper.\nRikke had seen this moment. Knew how it’d go. What came after was\nthe question. She gently shook her head. “My father would’ve said there are\nsome things a leader has to do themselves.”\n“Just one o’ you get on and do it,” snarled Stour over his shoulder,\njerking his tied hands towards her.\n“Patience, Great Wolf.” And she plucked the knife from Shivers’ hand.\nShe’d seen this come, knew it had to come, but even so, it wasn’t easy. Had\nto make of her heart a stone, like Isern always told her, even if her mouth\nwas dry as dust and there was chill sweat on her back and the knife weighed\nlike an anvil. She reached out, and took one of Stour’s wrists, and carefully\nsawed through the ropes that bound him.\nHe grinned a twisted grin. “Been waiting for this a while.”\nShe forced herself to grin back. “Oh, me, too.” And she stabbed him in\nthe throat. The blade hardly made a sound as it punched into the crosspiece\nwhere his neck met his shoulder, and straight out again along with a spurt of\nblood that soaked her hand. Shocked her, how hot it was.\nHe flinched, first, with a little gasp, like he’d been bee-stung. He stared\nat her, wet eyes wide, slack face all red-speckled from the bubbling wound.\n“Blith,” he said, drooling blood down his dirty shirt.\nRikke looked up at Shivers, and her hand was shaking but her voice was\nsteady. “Send him down, then.”\n“Right y’are.” And Shivers took one step and shoved the Great Wolf\nover the parapet.\nClover had been there, when the Bloody-Nine fought the Feared. Before he\nwon the name Steepfield, even. Long before he lost it. He’d held a shield at\nthe duel. He’d watched Bethod flung from the walls. Now he watched\nBethod’s grandson flung from about the same place, and crash down in\nabout the same place, crumpled in the wet grass where the Circle had been\nmarked out that day."

Stour lay with his arms spread wide\nas if greeting his father, but with his head twisted all the way around, his\nruined legs buckled under him and his blood spilling black into the green\ngrass. Till a few moments ago he’d been the future of the North. Now he\nwas mud. A stern lesson for anyone harbouring high ambitions.\nCalder stared down, mouth hanging open, then up at the gatehouse,\nwhere Rikke and Shivers were black figures against the bright sky.\n“Kill them!” he screamed, face twisting. “Kill them all!”\nIf anyone had asked him, Clover would’ve said there was less than no\nchance this’d be settled with talk. But you never realise how much hope\nyou’re holding till it gets knifed and thrown off a roof.\n“See you soon!” Rikke shrieked after them, stabbing at the sky with her\nbloody dagger. So maybe she wasn’t clever, and had seen nothing with her\nLong Eye at all, but was just the maddest of the whole crowd, and had\ndoomed herself and everyone who followed her. Probably Clover, too,\nwho’d done nothing but try to steer a safe course through a tempest of other\nmen’s making.\nHe’d had trouble controlling his horse at a walk. At a bone-rattling\ngallop away from the walls in the midst of a couple of dozen other barging,\nscraping, eye-rolling beasts he was helpless. He barely clung on, gripping\nwith his aching legs, reins flapping everywhere. There were arrows falling\naround them, flickering down into the grass. His shoulders were itching,\nsure he was about to get a shaft right in the back. One of Stand-i’-the-\nBarrows’ savages did, long hair tangled around his painted face as he\ntoppled screaming from his horse. There’s the big problem with bones as\narmour. They don’t bloody work.\nClover had never been more grateful to reach a treeline in his life,\nmanaged to slow his horse by dragging on the reins, then nearly set it\ntrotting back towards the walls, probably would’ve if Sholla hadn’t grabbed\nthe bridle. He slithered from the saddle and stood there with his hands on\nhis trembling knees, just breathing.\n“You all right?” Sholla asked him.\n“By the dead,” he croaked, holding on to her arm as he straightened up.\nStill felt dizzy. “I think I nearly shit myself.”\n“What the hell happened?”\n“What happened is…” Clover narrowed his eyes towards the walls of\nCarleon, like a man wincing into a storm. “I was hoping I’d never have to\nfight in another battle.” Black Calder’s men had started forwards. Not the\nmost eager of charges, after all the shit they’d waded through to get here.\nBut they’d started forwards even so.

Couldn’t have known better if she’d seen it with\nthe Long Eye herself.\nThen Rikke stabbed Stour in the neck and pushed him off the gatehouse.\nSo now there’d be a battle, then there’d be a sack, and who could say how\nthe hell that’d end? Of a sudden, everyone’s life was balanced on the brink,\nincluding hers. Hard to see how anything could’ve been less tied up than\nthis.\nAll around the city, Calder’s men were surging towards the walls.\nThousands of ’em. Tattered mobs, muddy and messy with metal glinting in\nthe midst, torn standards snatched by the wind, dozens of ladders among\n’em, their bloodthirsty cries echoing across the valley. Men on the walls\nbent their bows, sent arrows flickering out into the oncoming crowd. From\nwhere she stood, clinging to the pole of Rikke’s standard, Corleth saw a\ncouple fall. Far too few to make any difference.\nShe’d been sure she had everything tied up neat. Could pick Rikke’s\nevery move. Knew she was too soft, too trusting. But there was naught soft\nabout her now, her grin dotted with Stour’s blood, that one eye starting from\nher tattooed face and fixed on Corleth. Staring at her, and\nsmiling, that bloody knife loose in her hand and Caul Shivers huge\nand craggy beside her. And Corleth got this bad feeling in her stomach,\nand not the moon pains.\nShafts were flying the other way now, some on fire. Dropping in the\ntown, clattering from the slate roofs. Corleth hunched down, not too keen\non being arrow-pricked. She thought she could smell smoke. Shouting\neverywhere. Panic everywhere. Except here on the gatehouse roof. Except\nin Rikke’s face.\n“Your granny gets a lot o’ visitors,” she said.\n“What?”\n“Isern-i-Phail’s a suspicious sort. Maybe that’s what happens when\nyou’ve a madman for a father and no mother but the moon. She took against\nyou right off. So she set some folk to watch your granny and, phew.” Rikke\npuffed out her cheeks. “They’re in and out of her house like it’s a brothel.”\n“Folk come for advice.” Corleth tried to keep her voice level, no mean\nfeat in the midst of a battle. “They hold her in high regard—”\n“Three brothers in particular. They get lots of advice.”\n“Once a week,” said Shivers, frowning down at Corleth. With his hair\nbound back to show the full scale of his scar he looked a monster, that metal\neye flashing as the sun peeped through the clouds. How had she ever got\nhalfway used to it? She couldn’t stop her eyes flitting about. Lot of hard\nfaces up on that roof now and, given there was a battle unfolding in the\nother direction, a lot of ’em pointed at her."

There’s one place their ale is very much\nappreciated.”\n“Currahome,” grunted Shivers.\n“Hold on, though.” Rikke frowned. “Who do I know lives in\nCurrahome? It’s someone whose son I just killed. Name’s on the tip o’ my\ntongue…”\n“Black Calder?”\nRikke’s tattooed face lit up. “That is the bastard.”\nCorleth’s body was tensed to run, but there was nowhere to go. They\nwere setting ladders, outside the walls. She could see a couple swung up\nagainst the parapet, men struggling to shove ’em back down.\nRikke was blathering away like there was no danger at all. “Last time\none o’ those brothers headed up to Currahome, we stopped him ’fore he got\nthere, and the strangest thing… his kegs were all empty.”\n“Very disappointing,” said Shivers. “If you like ale.”\n“And who doesn’t? Must’ve been some other cargo he was taking up\nthere. He didn’t want to say what. But men tell Caul Shivers things they\nwouldn’t tell their own mothers.” Rikke clapped him fondly on the arm.\n“It’s that pretty metal eye of his, maybe.”\nShivers shrugged. “That or I just won’t stop cutting ’em.”\n“Aye, maybe it’s that. Do you know what his cargo was?”\nCorleth licked her lips. This wasn’t tied up neat at all. This was all\ncoming unravelled. “How would I know?” she whispered.\n“’Cause you gave it to him, silly!”\nAnd Corleth felt herself caught from behind. Caught and held, the\nstandard clattering on the stones. She struggled, more of an instinct than\nany real effort to get free, but one man had her left arm and another her\nright and a third caught her around the neck and held a dagger to her throat,\nand the cold brush of steel against her skin made her go slack as rags.\n“Secrets,” said Rikke, walking closer, the pupil of her Long Eye\nyawning huge, the other just a blind pinprick. “That was the cargo. What\nwe’re doing up here. How many men there are. Who’s fallen out with who.\nWhat I’m saying. What I’m thinking. Or what you think I’m thinking,\nanyway, which might not be quite the same thing. You told granny, and\ngranny told the brothers, and the brothers toddled up to Currahome on their\nfucking empty ale cart and told Black Calder all about it.”\nBy the dead, not far away down the wall some of Calder’s men had\nmade it to the top, blades twinkling as they struggled. Couldn’t be long,\nnow, till the city fell. Too long for Corleth, though, maybe.\nThere was no point clinging to the lie. They’d found her out long before."

After it’s done, Calder’ll be\nbegging to talk to me.”\nCorleth blinked at her. “You can’t win!”\n“I’ve heard that before.”\n“You’re way outnumbered! You chased all your friends away!”\n“Did I?” Rikke tapped the tattoo on her cheek. “Or did I see all this\ncoming, and it’s just the way I wanted it?”\nCorleth had thought she had everything tied up neat. Now it looked like\nshe was the one who’d been tied up all along. “You’re mad,” she whispered.\n“I’ve heard that before, too! But mad’s just a different way of seeing\nthings. Shivers, you reckon it’s time for a toot on that horn o’ yours?”\nShivers looked out at the fighting like Corleth’s granny looking at the\nsoup, judging whether it was the right moment to toss in the carrots. “Aye,”\nhe said, one loose strand of grey hair flicking around his frown with the\nwind, “rude to keep everyone waiting.” And he raised his horn to his lips\nand gave a great blast.\n“What’s happening?” muttered Hardbread, trying to get a look through the\ntrees. But all he could see was more trees. Distant twinkle of daylight,\nmaybe, between the trunks, through the leaves. But the whole idea was\nbeing far enough into the woods they wouldn’t be seen. And that meant,\npretty much by definition, not seeing much themselves.\n“Calder’s attacking, I reckon,” muttered Brandal, chewing at his\nthumbnail.\n“Yes, that, I know that, I can bloody hear it!” A distant clamour of\nvoices, echoing lazily from far off. Like a fair in the next valley. “But other\nthan that, I mean.”\nDamn, he was nervous. Aside from a couple of Calder’s scouts they’d\ncaptured and another one they’d shot as he rode away, they’d seen no\naction. It seemed a mad plan. It had seemed a mad plan all along. No way a\nman sharp as Black Calder would fall for it. But Rikke had just nodded and\ntapped her cheek in that knowing way and said, I’ve seen it. It couldn’t be\ndenied that she’d seen her way to her father’s bench in Uffrith. It couldn’t\nbe denied that she’d seen her way to Skarling’s Chair in Carleon. That had\nall seemed mad, too. Who knew what was sane any more? Certainly not\nHardbread. And, frankly, it would’ve taken a braver man than him to tell\nher no.\nBut that didn’t mean he wasn’t nervous. Stomach churning away.

That’d be just his luck, to get the call while he was squatting in the\nbrush, trousers down.\n“What the fuck’s—”\nAnd he heard the horn. A long, low, throbbing blast, echoing about the\nvalley. Hardbread had been waiting for it for hours. Thinking of it for days.\nHe’d dreamed of it in his fitful sleep the night before. But somehow when it\ncame it caught him by total surprise.\n“By the dead!” He scrambled to his feet, winced at a sharp twinge\nthrough his stiff ankle, near fell over and half-swallowed his tongue as he\nbellowed the order. “That’s it!” And he fumbled his sword out and held it\nhigh. “Charge!”\nThere was a great rattle, a great clatter, a great cry as all around him men\njumped to their feet and started rushing through the woods.\nHardbread hobbled along for a moment. Bloody hell, his knees, his hips,\nhe was creaking like a wooden man from squatting in the cold damp for\nhours. He had to stop, hold on to Brandal’s shoulder while he tried to shake\nsome life into his legs and men surged past him towards the daylight.\n“There we go!” And he set to running again. More of a jog, being\nhonest, it was tough through the trees. Broken ground and fallen branches\nand tree roots ready to trip you. He was wheezing as he burst from the\nwoods and heard the noise, far louder, far closer, far harsher.\nHis eyes were weaker than they once were and had tears in ’em from the\nwind of running, and he had to squint into the brightness, down towards\nCarleon. Calder’s men, crawling in the fields around the city. Swarms of the\nbastards. They were at the walls already, ladders up, arrows flitting this way\nand that.\n“By the dead,” he muttered.\nIt had seemed a mad plan, but it looked very much as if Calder had\nfallen for it, and fallen hard. The enemy had their arses stuck right out,\ntrapped between Hardbread’s men and the walls.\n“Charge!” he roared, though his voice was weak from the effort and the\nwind soon snatched it away and everyone was charging anyway, men\nbounding from the trees and into the open, pouring down the hillside. He set\noff again, Brandal beside him with the standard held high. More of an\namble than a run, being honest, it was tough outside the trees. Tough on the\nknees, the uneven ground on the ploughed field jolting him, making his\nteeth rattle, the sun flashing and flickering at him as the clouds rushed\noverhead. Couldn’t they have found a nice smooth stretch o’ road to charge\ndown?\nHe tottered to a halt, one hand propped on his thigh and his sword\ndangling from the other. Damn it, he was blown. There’d been a time he\ncould run for hours. Fastest runner in Uffrith. Used to be sent running over\nthe fells with messages. Thinking on it, though, that had been forty years\nago."

Spent so many years scared of losing he’d forgot how fine it felt to\nwin. “All right, Brandal, hoist that standard up, lad, we can’t dawdle.\nThere’s a battle to fight!”\n“Up you go, you fucker!” roared Flatstone, slapping one man on the back\nand sending him up the ladder. “Get up there, you bastard!” Thumping the\nnext man on the shoulder soon as there were a few rungs free. “Climb, you\nshit, climb!” Slapping the next man across his arse.

The men below, the\nmen above. “Go!”\nMore cries. Couldn’t stop himself glancing sideways. Saw a ladder\ntipping back. Saw the man at the top clutching at nothing, eyes wide with\nhorror. Saw another dropping, arms flailing, giving a great breathy squeal.\nFlatstone stuck to the stones in front of his face. Kept climbing. Nice and\nsteady.\nAnd suddenly he was up. Hauled himself over the parapet and dropped\ndown on the other side, Carleon spread out ahead, a hill of crooked streets\nand grey roofs with Skarling’s Hall at the top. He pulled his axe from his\nbelt, swung his shield from his back. Not a moment too soon. Arrows\nflickered from the windows of a building twenty strides away. One clattered\nagainst his shield. Another bounced from a man’s helmet just beside him.\nAnother found its mark and someone fell, screaming, barged into someone\nelse, knocked him from the walkway to topple into the town, wriggling in\nthe air.\nFires were burning. He could smell it. Smoke smudging the sky. Scratch\nof it in his throat as he struggled to catch his breath. Burning arrows shot\noverhead. There were men fighting everywhere. Metal clashed as his Carls\nflooded up the ladders and over the parapet. A grim strain as men struggled\nto shove back the defenders, shields scraping on shields, boots slipping and\nsliding in blood, tripping on bodies.\n“Yes!” bellowed Flatstone, pointing north with his axe. Above the\nwrithing men he could see the gatehouse Stour had fallen from. The\ngatehouse where that witch must be. They’d captured a good thirty strides\nof wall, were pushing the defenders back. “Push on! Drive ’em! Kill ’em!”\nThere was a Thrall sitting against the parapet, dead no doubt, but Flatstone\nsplit his head with his axe. No way he could make it through the press to the\nfighting, not yet, but it helped to get your weapon red, get your face red, get\nyour hands red, set the tone for what would come later. “Kill the—”\n“Chief!” someone roared in his ear, plucking at his shoulder. “Chief!”\n“Fucking what?” Flatstone bellowed, spinning about, and saw straight\naway what. A great mass of men were pouring down the long slope to the\nsouth of town. Towards the walls Flatstone and his men had just climbed. A\ntide of coloured shields and twinkling mail. Reinforcements! Come to help\nhim storm the city! He felt a rare smile crack his lips.\nThen he saw the standards streaming with the wind. Then he recognised\n’em. “What the…”\nHe’d fought some o’ those bastards at Red Hill. Seen those signs\nbobbing on the broken wall of the ruined fort there, where the Dogman"

Now here they were, charging right at his rear.\n“Where’d those bastards come from?” he gasped.\n“The south, I reckon—”\n“I can see that, you fool!”\n“They must’ve had men hanging back.”\n“You fucking think?”\nFlatstone stared wildly about, but now there was trouble ahead as well.\nCarls spilling from buildings in the town, surging up the steps to bolster the\nmen fighting on the walkways.\n“Fuck,” he whispered.\nThey had to push north, link up with the rest o’ Calder’s men, make a\nfight of it on the walls and in the fields outside the city. They’d been caught\noff balance, maybe, but they still had the numbers.\nHe leaned over the parapet. “Get up here!” he bellowed at the men on\nthe ladders, at the men at the foot of the ladders, at the men rushing to join\n’em, some of ’em realising what was coming up behind and already\nscattering. “Push north!” he roared at the men already up, pointing towards\nthe gatehouse. He thought he could see that witch on the roof, the bright red\nof her cloak, which meant the tall bastard beside her was Caul Shivers, sun\nglinting an instant on his metal eye. “The man who brings me that witch’s\nhead gets its weight in silver!” he roared.\nHe’d been thinking about gold, but even at a time like this you have to\nget value for money.\nThey were fighting, up on the wall. Ignet could see ’em, peeking around the\ncorner of her house. Something was burning. She could smell it. Like\nburned cakes.\nShe stared wi’ wide eyes, heart thumping. She saw a man kill another,\nup there on the walkway. Stab him with a spear. He fell, and tumbled onto a\nroof not far away, and slid down, his leg dangling from the thatched eaves.\n“Get inside, Ignet!” screeched her mother, catching her wrist and\ndragging her in. Her da flung the door shut. Shut it and double-bolted it.\nIgnet had always thought how strong those bolts looked, how heavy.\nNow they seemed spindly little sticks of iron to keep all those furious\nwarriors out o’ the house.\nShe shrank into the corner. She could still hear the fighting. The walls\nhad always looked so huge, but they didn’t any more. Would they come\nover? Would they get into the town? Would they start beating on the door?\nShe stared at the bolts, her shoulders up around her ears, waiting for\nthem to jump and rattle in the brackets.\n“What happens if Rikke wins?” asked her ma.\nHer da just stared.\n“What happens if she loses?” asked her ma.\nHer da numbly shook his head.\n“What do we do?” her ma screamed, clutching her da by his wrists.\n“What can we do?” he muttered at her.\nIgnet crawled under the table and put her hands over her head. Outside,\ndeep and throbbing, she heard that horn blow again."

Burning to fight. He could feel the eagerness of\nthe men around him, the men behind him, tensed like drawn bows, straining\nlike dogs at the leash. He could hear the battle joined, the joyous steel and\nlaughter music of it beyond the little rise. He couldn’t hold back, and he\nwriggled up to the crest, up to the waving grass, and peeked over, tongue-\ntip wedged between his bared teeth, down into the valley.\nOver on the left—Crinna bastards, bones-and-hides men, up at the walls\nof Carleon. Straight ahead—Black Calder’s Carls, with ladders to the\nstones. Over on his right—Hardbread’s men had made it down to the city,\nfighting in the fields, fighting up on the walls, and he couldn’t help a little\ngiggle.\nSo Rikke’s plan had worked. Seemed a mad plan, when she whispered it\nto him, her eyes in the darkness, the one that saw nothing and the one that\nsaw too much, her breath hot on his face and smelling pleasantly of ale.\nSeemed a mad plan, but such a bold one he couldn’t say no. Never even\nthought of saying no. Didn’t know how he’d ever say no to her.\nShe was honest and wise and beautiful and strange and knew things no\none else knew and said things no one else would’ve dared to and made him\nlaugh when no one else could. He’d never met a woman like her. There\nweren’t any others.\n“Come on, come on,” he whispered. “Come on.”\nHe’d heard of love but never thought it was anything for him to worry\nabout. But maybe this was love, this having of a woman always at the back\nof your mind. This feeling that any time not with her was time wasted. This\naching in him to get back into her bed.\nThe memory of her kicking her trousers off, sitting in Skarling’s Chair\nwith her eyes on him and her legs open, would get him hard at all the wrong\ntimes. By the dead, he was getting hard right now, lying on the damp hilltop\nlooking down at a battle.\nBut this was no day for lovers’ thoughts. This was a red day for red\nthoughts and red deeds. Rikke needed him, and the Great Leveller would\npay a red visit to any man who put himself between them.\n“Come on, come on, come on, come—”\nHe was up and sprinting before the echoes of Shivers’ second blast even\nfaded, flying down the sedge-patched hillside.\nHe’d never been one for war cries. Why tell your enemy where you are?\nThey’ll learn soon enough.\nSurprise, that’s the key. Whether you’re fighting one man or a thousand\nor ten thousand.

He knew the others\nwere with him. His brothers, his cousins, every man he could gather,\ntrekked the long, cold road back from the West Valleys in secret darkness to\nbe here.\nThe baggage was ahead. Calder’s soft underbelly. The dirty horses and\nthe mud-caked wagons that held the supplies. The smiths and the cooks.\nThe women and the children who slogged after the men. Killing the fighters\nwas cutting off the fingers, but hitting the baggage was cutting out the guts.\nAnd the Nail felt the fierce smile spread across his face, the fierce fire\nburning through his limbs, stronger and stronger with every stride.\nMight be he loved Rikke, but battle was his oldest love, his first love.\nThat was who he was and who he’d always be.\nThere were a few guards, but most were already running. He could hear\ntheir desperate cries, tugging him on. Women, too, shrieking and wailing.\nThere was a fighter at the front, in bright mail with a bright spear, trying to\nturn his men, to form a wobbly shield-wall, but they weren’t halfway there.\nFar too late and far too few. The Nail ran right for him, faster’n ever, wind\nin his face. He always went at the hardest-looking bastard he could find.\nBring down their toughest, break the rest.\nThe Nail was on him. Hit his shield with his axe, staggered him with the\nforce of it, chopped with his sword and it caught the rim, struck a spark,\njolted in his hand, a lovely jolt. The breath sawed at his chest, ripped up his\nthroat, hissed through his fixed smile, his clenched teeth. He hacked away,\ndrove the man back into a crouch then caught his leg with his sword and\nmade him howl. Blood spattered.\nThe Nail dodged his desperate spear-thrust, hooked his wobbling shield\ndown with his axe, stabbed with his sword, stabbed in the open face of his\nhelmet. He fell back, blood pouring from his split mouth. He was trying to\nsay something but all he could say was blood and that was eloquence\nenough, in its way. The eloquence o’ the battlefield.\n“Kill ’em all!” screamed the Nail, since there was no need for surprise\nany longer, just for fury, and he stomped on that warrior’s head as he ran\non, trampled him into the mud. Others around him, swinging, hacking,\nshrieking, laughing, dodging between the wagons, springing around the\nsnorting, tramping horses. Flowing through the baggage like a red flood. All\ndrunk on battle. All mad on it.\nHe slipped past a cart up on blocks to have its wheel changed and a\nmud-covered man came slithering out from under it, sobbing and\nwhimpering. Must’ve been hiding there, flushed out by someone else.\n“Hello,” said the Nail, already swinging as the man twisted about, wet\neyes staring.

Caught his neck just right and took his head spinning off and it\nclonked against the side of the cart. Blood sprayed the horse half-harnessed\nin the traces and it bucked, kicked out and set off at a wild, straining canter,\ndragging the cart jolting after on one wheel, barrels and boxes bouncing\nfrom the back, catching a tent and ripping it up, dragging it after like the\ntrain on a bride’s dress, torn clothes and dented pots and bent spoons\ntumbling out and scattered in its wake through the ripped-up grass.\nGood plunder here, good takings. A tent went up in flames as it fell in a\nfire. Stink of smoke and fear. The Nail watched a boy run a few steps, off\nbalance, fall, scramble up and totter a few steps, fall again, get up, fall\nagain. Calder’s men had been lazy, foolish, weary from their march and\nfixed on the city ahead. Now they scattered like a flock of crows and he was\nthe hawk among ’em.\nThe Nail hacked someone in an apron in the back with his axe, made\nhim scream, knocked him on his face, one of his boots flying off. Someone\nsmiled as he smashed a man’s head against the corner of a cart. He slashed\nanother across the backs of the legs and brought him down, rolling over and\nover. Someone was bashing a wooden chest open with a hammer, joyful\nsplinters flying. He hacked his axe into the back of a man’s head and left\nhim staggering around with a big piece of his skull hanging off, and\nbounded on with a delighted whoop, past some woman sat limp and staring\nin the grass, shocked tears tracking her blood-streaked face. Someone\nlaughed as they stomped another’s face into the mud. He could hear his\nbrothers, his cousins, his men, whooping and hacking and cheering. He\ndodged a desperate swing of a sword, hacked at the arm that held it, blood\nflying, hacked again, barged the man out of his way, hacked at him again as\nhe fell, missed and stumbled on, not caring.\nThe Nail clenched his jaw, fixing his eyes on the city. More men ahead,\nand not running so easily. Starting to gather into something like a line,\nfacing away from Carleon. Facing him. He took a ripping breath, and blew\nout blood, and smiled wider than ever. The easy killing was done.\nNow came the hard killing.\n“Make a line!” roared Trapper.\nHe’d been heading for the walls, steeling himself for the climb, when\nhe’d seen the men sweep down from the south. Now men were pouring into\ntheir rear from the west as well. Black Calder had been caught with his\nfucking trousers down and no mistake, and they all had their arses out with\nhim.\n“Make a fucking line!” he snarled, catching a running man by the\nshoulder.\n“You make a line!” A fist caught him on the side of the jaw, knocked him\nstumbling.\nHe couldn’t even tell who’d thrown it.

Trapper wasn’t sure who they were.\nWhere they’d come from. That witch Rikke must’ve witched ’em up out o’\nhell. They’d laughed at the Long Eye, back in Currahome. No one was\nlaughing now.\n“Shields, you fucks!”\nThey stared at him with wet, wide, terrified eyes. A horse charged past,\ndragging the shattered remains of a wagon. A man gave a great squeal, an\narrow in his side. Another was on his knees, clutching, clutching, hands\nclamped to his bloody face. “I can’t see, I can’t see!”\n“Shields!” roared Trapper, not knowing what more he could do than\nshout. But his men were already running. Even the ones he’d gathered. The\nlittle knot flying apart in every direction, tossing down their weapons.\nTrapper would’ve run, too, if he could’ve seen anywhere to run to.\nMen were charging at him. Cutting, hacking, driving running figures\nahead of them. At the front was a tall, lean bastard with an axe and a sword\nand a shock of pale hair, his snarling devil’s face all dashed with red.\nBy the dead, the Nail. That mad bastard was supposed to be miles away.\nTrapper dropped his shield.\nThere was nowhere to run to.\nHe ran anyway.\nSholla had thought they’d be far from the fighting on this little hillock in the\neaves of the woods. A nice tump with a big flat rock sunk into the lush\ngreen on top, a perfect spot to sit and shave some cheese on a happier day.\nHere they’d be safe, and could get a good view of the carnage, and a sound\nlesson in why battles are things best avoided.\nShe’d watched Calder’s men and the Crinna bastards move forwards, set\ntheir ladders, start to climb. Then everything had fallen apart. First what\nlooked like men of Uffrith had come pouring down from the far hills to the\nsouth, then what looked like men of the West Valleys had swept in from the\nwest, ripping through the baggage, splitting Calder’s forces in half. Some of\n’em were pressing in not too far from where Sholla and Flick were\nstanding.\nThere’s the trouble with avoiding battles. Sometimes they reach out and\nfind you anyway.\nCalder’s guards had made a ring of shields about the top of the hillock,\nand on the crest beside the flat stone where Calder’s standard was set—the\nsame sign Bethod used to fight under. The great man himself stood in its\nshadow, arms grimly folded, watching his army and all his hopes crumble.\nClover lurked not far off in that hunched way of his, like he was trying\nto fade out o’ sight.

You?”\n“Apart from… all this.” And she waved the arrow towards the furious\nfight not a hundred strides off now. “Where did they come from?”\n“The West Valleys, I reckon. The Nail and his boys. Seems he didn’t fall\nout with Rikke after all.” Clover rubbed his jaw with something close to\nadmiration. “Reckon she laid a smart trap and we’ve all blundered into it.\nKnew I should’ve stuck with her.” He put a hand on Sholla’s shoulder,\nleaning close. “Might be a good move for you and Flick to head into the\nwoods.” There were a lot of other folk heading into the woods. Heading as\nfast as their legs’d carry ’em. Most of Clover’s boys had already melted\naway. It was about what their chief would’ve done, after all.\n“What about you?” muttered Sholla.\nClover glanced sideways at Calder. “I’ve a sense our chief would rather\nI remained.”\n“I want to stay,” said Flick, weighing his sword in his hand.\n“No, you don’t,” said Clover, simply. “Here’s your last lesson. Winning\nbattles is bad enough. Never hang around to see one lost.”\nSholla liked Clover. But nowhere near enough to die for him. She gave\nhim a nod, shrugged her bow over her shoulder, then caught Flick by the\nshirt and dragged him off towards the trees, arrow still clutched in her\nsweaty hand.\nDownside was watching it all with his teeth angrily bared as they\npassed, turning the haft of his axe around and around in his hand.

Not that you could miss the battle, if you\nhad your eyes open.\n’Twas a vast battle. Ten battles put together. Biggest he ever saw by far.\nBigger’n any his father saw, in spite of all his bloated boasting, which had\nbeen one o’ the man’s many failings. His father once claimed he killed two\nhundred men at Yarnvost and Scenn later learned there’d only been a\nhundred with both sides put together. Thinking of his father made him\nsmile. He’d hated that fat bastard, but he’d been quite the laugh in the right\nmood. Beloved of the moon, he’d been. Beloved of the moon, and laughing\nwith the moon now, no doubt, as they smiled down fondly on the slaughter.\nHis sister Isern did not smile fondly. But then she never did.

Which, he\nhad to confess, was one of his many failings. “There’s good work being\ndone and I itch for my part in it.” He held up the hammer and spun it about\nin his fist, smiling upon the many scars on its heavy head. “Our father’s\nhammer is hungry.”\n“It’s a bloody hammer,” said Isern, flicking the results of her nose-\npicking away among the leaf-rot. “It feels no hunger.”\n“Well, his axe is hungry, then,” said Scofen, holding up the axe, no less\nbattle-weathered.\n“Likewise the axe. Might as well say his spear’s sleepy.” And Isern gave\nit a shake. “Load o’ nonsense. They’re wood and metal and have no\nfeelings.”\n“But I want to get at these painted bastards!” snarled Scofen, rubbing\nimpatiently at the tattoos on his face. To start on his failings would’ve kept\nthe lot of them busy all day.\n“You’ll get your chance,” said Isern.\nAnd there was the horn, throbbing through the roots o’ the trees and\ngiving Scenn a tickle in his toes.\n“There it is!” called Scofen. “It’s time!”\nScenn grinned wide at his sister. “Da would’ve fucking loved this!”\n“Like I care what that bastard loved.” She leaped atop a rock, holding\nhigh their father’s spear, her skirts bound right up and the knotty sinews\nbulging from her bare legs. “Let’s give these Crinna sheepfuckers a fucking\nthey’ll not forget!”\nWith those rousing words still ringing, she sprang away and off they\ntumbled after, bursting from the trees and down the slope towards the grey\ncity, the good wind rushing about them and their war-songs echoing around\nthe valley.\n“For the moon!” someone wailed.\n“For the hills!” someone else.\n“For Crummock-i-Phail!” roared Scenn.\nAt his back were any of the hillfolk who’d fancied a battle—which, o’\ncourse, was pretty much the full tally, scoured from every cranny in the\nmountains. They’d been offered a chance to fight, which they loved, and to\nfight Black Calder, who they hated almost as much as they’d hated Bethod,\nand also Rikke had offered two rich valleys to those who fought, and\nthough some might think the hillmen lived simple lives, in truth they were\nas greedy as anyone, if not a little more so.\nThe Crinna bastards were spread out ahead in a spiked and painted line.\nHorrible savages, they were, all pierced and puckered and covered in\nbloody bones.

A great maddened dog ran past with an arrow in its side. Another\ncame at Scenn but Scofen caught it in the belly with a great sweep of his\naxe and sent it tumbling away to roll and mewl and wriggle.\nThere was death smeared all over and the good grass watered with good\nblood and the moon could not but smile on this day’s work. Rikke-o’-the-\nLong-Eye in particular, who’d looked but a pale and stringy streak when\nshe was carried into the hills but had seen this come, made this come, laid\nout the good gifts so they could all take their fill.\nScenn laughed as he kicked a limping savage in the back and smashed\nhis arse in with the hammer, smashed his head in as he crawled. Swung for\nanother as he ran and missed, and stumbled around in a circle and was\nnearly dragged right over.\nIt was a fearsome weapon, the hammer, but heavy as mountains.

Mind\nyou, he hadn’t the belly for that slippery business, nor honestly the wits, nor\nhonestly the puff.\nHe set the hammer head-down and leaned on it, catching his breath,\nwatching Scofen hack at the dead and Isern stand on a man’s back and stab\nhim through the throat and the rest of the hillmen stream into the back of\nthe Crinna bastards and send them scattering like starlings.\nMade him proud to see the hillfolk fighting as one. Hadn’t happened in\nmany a long year. Not since the Battle in the High Places, maybe, where the\nBloody-Nine had killed his brother Rond. Thanks to his father’s endless\nappetite for wives, though, he had brothers and sisters in plenty, so not too\nmuch lost. It’s a poor life ploughed that hasn’t left a few dead siblings in its\nfurrow. The weak are winnowed out to leave the strong. The chaff is taken\nby the wind, so the seed beloved of the moon can flourish.\nHe frowned over at a set of great pots, man high, fires banked\nunderneath ’em, steam pouring from inside.\n“What the bloody hell are the pots for?” asked Scenn. “Soup or\nsomething?”\n“They’re for rendering down the corpses, d’you see.” Isern frowned at\nher spear’s bloody head. “So they can get at the bones.”\nScenn shook his head in disbelief. “What a pack of arseholes.”\nRance held his axe tight and tried to work up the anger. They’d come to\nburn his city, hadn’t they? Come to kill his people. Time to be a man.\nAt a fourth blast from Shivers’ horn, ear-splitting from being so close,\ntwo big Carls hefted the bar from its brackets, and two others shoved the\ndoors wide, and they sallied from the gates of Carleon and out into the\nfields in front.\nBy the dead, the noise. At the last moment, Rance’s feet seemed stuck to\nthe cobbles but he was carried along anyway, among the warriors spilling\nfrom the city like a cork in a flood.\nCalder’s men weren’t ready. Panicked by the attacks from behind, now\npanicked by an attack from in front. They wavered, spears wobbling, but\nRance didn’t fancy running at ’em. Didn’t fancy it at all. It came to him, of\na sudden, how hard and unforgiving is a spearhead, and how soft and easily\ntorn is a man’s belly.\nHe stumbled from the flow of howling, screaming, charging men. He\nflinched as someone toppled from the walls a few strides away, a ladder\nflung down in ruin on top of him. The world smelled of blood and smoke.\nBodies everywhere. Wounded crawling, moaning, clutching.\nHis uncle had warned him it was no business for a boy o’ twelve. Now\nhe saw it wasn’t only man’s work, but madman’s work.

A young man, his helmet fallen off to\nshow blond hair matted with blood. One eye open, staring at nothing much.\nHe saw Caul Shivers cutting his way through the enemy, grey sword\ngoing up and whipping down with such terrible speed, with such horrible\nforce, and it came to him how razor-sharp and ruthless is a sword-blade,\nand how fragile a man’s skull. Calder’s men were falling back. Falling\napart. Hardly seemed like he was needed, really. Most likely there’d be time\nto be a man later.\nHe slipped along the wall and back through the gate, into the shadows.\n“Run!” roared Stand-i’-the-Barrows, and he broke for the trees, and\nScunlich loped along after. A great fighter must not only know when to\nfight, but when not to, and Scunlich was as proud of the few bad fights\nthey’d got away from as the many good ones they’d won. This was a bad\none, very bad, the worst.\nThe hillmen chased after them a way, but fell to picking over the dead\nfor trinkets and were left behind. They sent arrows flitting after, whistling\nfarewells, twittering into the greenwood, clicking into the trunks with their\nfeathers fluttering. Stand-i’-the-Barrows kept up a fast pace on his long\nshanks and the sound of battle soon faded.\nThey stopped to catch their breath and listen. Gromma had an arrow in\nhis back and sat down beside a tree, wheezing red, and did not get up.\n“We were fools to trust in Black Calder!” shouted Yort. “The cunning of\ncunning men always runs out, and usually at the worst moment. I said so\nback in—”\nStand-i’-the-Barrows caught him around the neck and bore him down\nonto the ground and squatted over him, throttling him, beating his skull\nagainst a tree root until the blood flowed, then catching his head and\ntwisting it right around until his neck came apart with a thick crunching.\n“That was well done,” said Scunlich.\n“Aye,” he said, standing up. “I wish I could take his bones.” And the\nothers grunted their agreement. It was a worthy thought. Then Stand-\ni’-the-Barrows ran on, his axe in his hand, and Scunlich ran on with him,\nbut it seemed the further they went into the wood and the darker and\ndimmer and greener it grew, the fewer of them were left.\nThere was a chill among the trees. A damp chill and a mist clinging to\nthe scrub so the twigs came lashing from nowhere and the brambles\nclutched out from the grey to snag foot and ankle and bring men down\nsquealing in the undergrowth.\n“Whence comes this mist?” hissed Stand-i’-the-Barrows, creeping\nforwards slowly, and it was true it seemed a thing alive, twisting between\nthe black trunks, sticking to men in tatters.\nThey blundered into a clearing, Scunlich stumbling forwards with his\nhands stretched out like a blind man searching.

A stunted tree loomed from\nthe murk. Or no, a stump, and on the stump a figure. An old woman, bent,\nbut something gleamed on her forehead as she looked up, and Scunlich\ntottered back amazed, for he saw that her face was split by a great scar, and\nthe two halves were stitched together with golden wire.\n“A devil,” he whispered. “A devil!”\nThe bone-pickers had gathered into a knot, no more than a dozen left\nwhere there’d been hundreds, thousands. Now they crowded close about\nStand-i’-the-Barrows, back to back, drawing strength from his strength.\n“Did you make this mist?” he snarled at the woman.\n“I did,” she said, “and reckon it a good one.” And though she was old\nher voice was young, as beautiful to listen to as she was dreadful to look\nupon.\n“I do not, witch.” Stand-i’-the-Barrows took a step forwards, feet falling\nheavy in the silence. “Remove it.”\n“As you wish.”\nLike water from a broken bowl, the mist drained from the clearing, but\nScunlich felt no joy at its passing. He saw figures among the trees at its\nedge. Ghosts at first, all around, but turning more horribly real with every\nmoment, and Scunlich found he was wishing that the mist would come\nagain.\n“Gods,” he whispered, his blood turning cold.\nThey were twisted things. Unholy things. Things of flesh and metal. Of\ntusks and teeth and rivets. Of rusted plates and criss-crossed scars. Things\nwith flattened heads and bent limbs, cut apart and stitched together.\nClutched in their claws they had cruel spears, cruel bows, cruel knives and\naxes and daggers.\n“These I made, too,” sang the witch, stroking the hairless head of one of\nthem. They slipped forwards, a tightening ring, dozens of them, hundreds,\neyes gleaming in the gloom of the greenwood.\n“What do you want?” And Scunlich heard a thing he had never heard\nbefore in the voice of Stand-i’-the-Barrows and had never thought to hear.\nThe quaver of fear.\nThe witch smiled, skin twisting and puckering around the golden\nstitches.\n“Your bones,” she said.\nSatisfaction and Regret\n“I\nt’s all done,” said Calder.\nHe sounded puzzled. But, for a man watching all his dreams dissolve,\nvery calm. Handled defeat a lot better than most great warriors Clover had\nknown. He looked almost amused by the sudden turn towards disaster. “My\nson’s dead. The North’s lost. It’s all done.”\nNo one was disagreeing, and Clover least of all.\nCalder’s guards had made a crescent-shaped wall around that little green\nhill with the one flat rock on top, their shields locked and their weapons\nready. Might well have been the only order left in the whole army. The right\nwing crumbled when the men of Uffrith came pouring down.

The hillmen had come howling from the trees and taught\nthose Crinna bastards who the real savages were. Then the gates opened and\nCaul Shivers caught the last resistance between hammer and anvil. All\nmanaged with a few blasts of his horn as neatly as a spring dance. But with\na lot more corpses.\nNot far off one of those great dogs bounced and rolled and barked, its\nside somehow on fire, frisking madly across the grass, trying to escape from\nitself. Something Clover had been trying to do for years, with as little\nsuccess.\n“We’ve got to run,” he muttered, giving the trees a wistful glance. “Run,\nor give up.”\n“Run or give up.” Calder gave him a withering look. “Ever the counsel\nof Jonas Clover. I’m surprised you’re not advising me to switch sides.”\nClover winced. “Fear it’s a bit late for that.”\n“Aye. Just one thing I have to do first. Meant to do it after I won.” He\nbreathed in, and sighed out. “But I guess it’ll have to be now.”\nMaybe the years hadn’t dulled Clover’s instinct as much as he’d always\nthought, because somehow he felt it coming. He threw himself sideways,\nthe wind of the axe kissing his scalp. He rolled clumsily, scrambled back\nfast enough that Downside’s second swing thudded into the turf right\nbetween his legs. He stumbled to his feet, nearly fell again as he tottered\nbackwards up the hill, then dodged behind the big stone at the top,\nbreathing hard.\nNot very dignified, but then Clover long ago decided he’d rather have\nhis life than his dignity. The dead help him, he drew his sword. Always the\nfirst lesson whenever he taught sword-work—never draw the bastard thing.\nBut he drew it now, and he weighed it, and he saw the gleam run down the\npolished metal.\n“What the fuck are you doing, Downside?” he shouted over the noise of\nbattle.\n“Killing you. Ain’t that obvious?”\n“’Cause Calder paid you to?”\nDownside looked confused. “’Course.”\n“But he’s done!” Clover waved with his free hand towards the battle,\nwhich was hard not to wave at, since it was all around ’em, pressing in\ncloser on Calder’s guards with every breath they took. “Anyone can see\nhe’s fucking done! He’s saying he’s done himself!”\n“I’ll tell you the truth, Clover.” Downside stepped towards him, probing\nfor an opening, his heavy boot working its way into the turf. “I’m not clever\nenough to keep track of all the twisting and turning. Makes my head hurt.\nAll that cunning, just to end up where you started? No. I say a thing, I\nfollow through.”\nAnd he sprang forward. He was fast for such a big man. Best Clover\ncould do was dodge back, stumble and near trip over his own feet before he\nfound his balance again. They circled each other, that flat stone between\nthem.

They\nwere too busy fighting for their own lives, enemies pressing in tighter with\nevery breath.\nSeemed most unfair, after he gave Downside a place when no one\nwanted the mad bastard. But Clover supposed a man who’d let down as\nmany people as he had couldn’t get too upset at being let down himself.\nHe’d lost count o’ those he’d failed. Those he’d turned on. Cairm\nIronhead, and Glama Golden, and Stour Nightfall. Magweer with the\nflatbow bolt in his throat. Wonderful, too, pointing that beautiful raised\neyebrow. An accusing crowd of disappointed friends, comrades, leaders,\nshaking their heads at him from the land of the dead. Clover shook the\nthought off. Hardly the kind you want weighing on you in a fight. He felt\nheavy enough already as he backed away, glancing about for anything that\nmight help him and not finding it.\nDownside looked big when he was on your side. He looked a lot bigger\non the other, with his scarred shield up, heavy mail from neck to knees and\na steel cap on. A hard bastard to put down with a sword. Faster than Clover\nwas, and stronger, and better armed. But it’s a man’s wits that set him apart\nfrom the beasts. Or so he told himself. Downside stepped forwards again\nand Clover slipped sideways, trying to keep the flat rock between them and\nhoping some opportunity might present itself. The fighting crouch he used\nto use didn’t feel too comfortable. Stiffer joints and a lot more belly than\nthe last time he tried it, maybe.\nCalder’s standard-bearer stood a few strides off, a young lad with eyes\nbig as cartwheels at all the battle and death, not to mention the duel that had\nbroken out right under his nose.\n“You!” shouted Calder. “Kill him.”\nThe standard-bearer numbly drew his sword. He looked at Clover. He\nlooked at Calder. He looked at one of Calder’s guards, crawling through the\ngrass with an arrow in his shoulder while the others shuffled to plug the\ngap. Then he let go of the standard and sprinted for the trees. Calder stared\nafter him. A little wistful, almost, as his standard toppled over and slid\ndown the hill. For twenty years, his authority had been iron-forged. Now it\nwas cobwebs in a storm. All it takes is one lost fight. Clover could’ve told\nhim that, but he was a little busy.\nHe gasped as Downside rushed at him, managed to dodge the first\nwhipping axe swing. Clover looked for an opening he could stab at but the\nbig shield came at him fast, the rim crunching into his mouth, snapping his\nhead up. He got his bearings just in time to see the axe flashing at him the\nother way and staggered clear, heavy blade hissing past and knocking a\ngreat chunk from the stone. Clover stumbled away, trying to shake the\nthrobbing from his head, from his jaw, nearly blundered into one of\nCalder’s guards as he ran wild-eyed for the trees. Downside grinned over\nthe bright rim of his shield. Clover stuck his tongue into the sore hole where\na tooth used to be and spat blood."

Clover stuck his tongue into the sore hole where\na tooth used to be and spat blood.\nThe truth was, a stubborn splinter of Jonas Steepfield was still buried in\nhim. Buried so deep it could never be worked free. Buried so deep that it\nstung at him whenever he backed down, whenever he ran away, whenever\nhe changed sides. And now it worked its way up to the surface. Worked its\nway up and came out in a long, low growl.\n“All right, fucker,” he snarled, fist tightening around the grip of his\nsword. “Let’s have you.”\n“Have me?” sneered Downside. “Can you even—”\nAn arrow came looping from the trees and stuck into Downside’s\nshoulder. It didn’t stick deep. Just lodged in his mail. Probably didn’t even\ndraw blood. But it was enough to make him turn his head, for an instant.\nIn the end, the only thing a man can really do is pick his moment. Watch\nfor the opening, and recognise it when it comes, and seize it.\nClover feinted left, switched right, heard the grunt of surprise as\nDownside’s axe thudded into the turf where he might’ve been. Clover was\nalready rolling across the flat stone, came up turning, edge of his sword\nflicking out and catching the back of Downside’s boot, below the hem of his\nmail coat.\nDownside hardly even noticed, growled as he turned, lifting his axe,\nstepping forwards. Then he lurched sideways with a surprised hoot,\nclutching the edge of the stone with his shield hand. Clover reckoned that\nwas the tendon snapping at the back of his ankle.\nDownside hopped once on his good leg, giving a great spitty roar,\nswinging wildly. Clover whipped back, let the heavy blade sail pass his\nnose. As Downside spun, he stepped forwards, thrusting under the rim of\nthe shield.\nMetal scraped as the point slid through Downside’s mail and into his\nbelly. Clover might never draw the thing in anger, but he kept it sharp even\nso.\nDownside’s eyes went very wide. He tottered forwards as Clover pulled\nhis sword back, his ruined ankle gave under him and he slumped onto one\nknee. He took a gasping breath. “I think—”\n“No one cares.” Clover took his head off with one whipping swing. It\nbounced once, then rolled down the slope, towards where Calder’s last\nguards were tossing away their weapons. The body dropped sideways,\nblood spilling out in a great wash that Jonas Steepfield would no doubt have\ntaken great pleasure in.\nCalder raised his brows at it. “You can still swing that sword, then.”\n“I try not to advertise the fact.” Clover turned his head and spat blood\nagain. “I find it makes folk want to try to kill you.”\nRikke stood outside the gates of Carleon, rubbing gently at her red-stained\nhand and frowning down at Stour Nightfall’s broken corpse. No one else\nwas paying it much mind. Nothing on it worth stealing, after all.\nShe’d often heard it said that there’s no sweeter sight than dead enemies."

The\ntruth was she felt no satisfaction, seeing the Great Wolf back to the mud.\nBut she felt no regret, either. It had needed doing. For her father. For her\npeople. For herself. It had been long overdue.\nThe battle was done with, more or less. A few men still fighting, in little\nknots against the walls, and a lot running, dotting the valley sides, but\nmostly Calder’s warriors were tossing their weapons down, holding their\nhands up, kneeling on the wheel-rutted, boot-smashed, arrow-prickled\nground. Those that weren’t lying down already, of course, never to rise, of\nwhich there were many.\nShe felt no satisfaction at the sight. But no regret, either.\n“There’s my girl!” Isern came swaggering through the carnage, blood\nstreaking her face from a cut on her forehead but her missing tooth showing\nin a great smile even so.\n“Isern-i-Phail.” And Rikke hugged her tight, and kissed her on the\ncheek, and her sour sweat and chagga smell was a surprising comfort.\n“Knew you wouldn’t let me down.”\nIsern licked her fingers and rolled a chagga pellet. “Always said you’d\ncome to something, didn’t I? Never once doubted it.”\n“You said how much you doubted it every morning, noon and night,”\nsaid Rikke, making a grab for the chagga.\nWith marvellous dexterity, Isern flicked it into her mouth before Rikke’s\nfingers could close on it. “If your faults aren’t spread clearly before you,\nhow can you improve on the bastards?”\nMen shuffled back as she passed, heads lowered. Men stood out of her\nway, respectful. Men cleared an open pathway for her, and stomped their\nboots, and rattled their swords, and tapped their axes against their shields\ntill they sent up a great clatter of approval as she strode by. The same one\nthey might’ve made for the Bloody-Nine, or Skarling Hoodless, or any of\nthe great War Chiefs of the past. The truth was she could hardly believe the\nplan had worked. But it wouldn’t do to let anyone else know that. So she\nwalked head high, shoulders back, the way she’d seen Savine dan Brock\nwalk, as if she’d never known what doubt was, to the foot of a green\ntummock under the eaves of the forest where the dead were thickly\nscattered.\nShivers nodded at her, his shield pecked and scored in the fighting and\nhis hair unbound again and hanging across his face. “All good?”\n“All good.” No need for more between the two of them.\nBlack Calder was at the top.

It’s the winners that change things.\nClover gave her a nod. “I got him, Chief.”\n“That a fact?” Rikke nudged a big corpse lying in a slick of blood with\nher foot. “And did you get him, too?”\n“My man Downside. He always did suffer from too much fight and not\nenough judgement.”\n“So you’ve chosen a side, finally?”\n“I’ve always been on the same one,” said Clover. “Whichever wins.”\nAll the while, Calder was frowning up at her. “You found my spy.”\n“Isern-i-Phail had her picked the moment she arrived.”\n“I can smell a lie,” said Isern, spear across her shoulders with her blue\nhand and her pale dangling over the haft. “And that bitch reeked.”\n“I thought it all felt too easy,” mused Calder, frowning off towards\nCarleon, across the corpse-scattered fields where even now the last of his\narmy were being driven off or taken prisoner.\n“Aye, well,” said Rikke, “we’re all prone to believe what we want to. It\nwas Shivers handed me the notion, to begin with.”\nShivers gave a modest shrug. “No strength like looking weak.”\n“All I did was…” Rikke fluttered her fingers. “Sprinkle some glitter on\nit.”\n“It was well done.” Calder narrowed his eyes thoughtfully at her. “Tell\nme one thing, between us… does it really work? The Long Eye? Did you\nknow how it would turn out all along?”\nShe looked down at him, thumb inside the chain of emeralds she wore.\n“I know how it’ll turn out now. Years ago, my father swore to kill you if\nyou crossed the Cusk again.”\n“I remember.” Calder nodded slowly, his eyes fixed far off. “It all has to\nbe paid for, in the end.”\n“Took a while for me to keep his word,” said Rikke. “But we got there.\nShivers?”\n“Aye,” he said, and drew his sword.\nCalder looked up as its shadow fell across him. “Been a long time.”\n“Aye,” said Shivers.\n“I remember when you saved my life. In the Circle at the Heroes.”\n“Aye.”\n“Quite the irony. That it should be you who ends it.”\n“Aye.”\n“Well. I can hardly say I don’t deserve it.”\n“Seems your father’s dream came true after all,” said Rikke. “The North\nunited.” She put her hands behind her head and stretched up tall. “It just\nwon’t be his blood that leads it. Scale’s back to the mud. Stour’s back to the\nmud. Bethod’s line ends with you.”\n“Ah.” For some reason, Calder had the ghost of a smile at the last.

There was a sharp crack, blood sprayed up in dark streaks\nand Calder flopped face down on the dirty grass.\nThere was a long silence, after the great noise of the battle. Every eye\nfixed on the bubbling wound in the back of Black Calder’s head. Shivers\nstood frowning down in the midst of those staring faces, the sword that had\nbeen the Bloody-Nine’s in his fist, that dull, grey blade with the one silver\nletter dashed and speckled with blood.\nThen Scenn-i-Phail lifted high his hammer, which looked to have some\nhair stuck to the scarred head. “This was well done!” he roared.\n“Truly the girl is beloved o’ the moon!” said his brother Scofen,\nlaughing and waving his axe.\n“Black Calder ruled the North.” Isern slapped a hard hand down on\nRikke’s shoulder. “She who beat him should do the same. The children of\nCrummock-i-Phail stand with Black Rikke!”\n“And I!” roared the Nail, before Rikke could get a word in, stepping up\nout of the crowd, so spattered head to toe with blood it looked like he’d\ngone swimming in it. “I stand with Black Rikke!”\n“And I,” grunted Hardbread, clambering with some effort onto the little\nknoll. He gave a burp and thumped at his breastbone, peering down at\nCalder’s corpse. “Your father would’ve been proud.”\nRikke blinked at them. Calder had stolen the name from Black Dow, that\nday on the Heroes. Seemed now she’d stolen it from him.\n“Black Rikke!” men were shouting all around, even some who’d been\nCalder’s men until the sword fell. They had to be someone else’s men now,\nafter all. “Black Rikke!” All competing to shout it loudest, as though having\na girl with a tattooed face in charge who used to shit herself in the streets of\nUffrith was their fondest dream. “Black Rikke!” As though this had been\nwhat everyone wanted all along. What they’d expected.\nShivers carefully wiped his sword with a rag, sunlight glinting on his\nmetal eye. “Looks like you win,” he said.\nRikke looked from that little hill across the churned-up battlefield, then\ndown at Calder’s corpse.

A room in the palace where\nsome minor visiting dignitary could have gently aged as they waited on His\nMajesty’s pleasure.

Except for the crooked bars bodged into the\nwindow frames and the sense of barely contained mortal terror.\nThey had given her good food and clean linen. They had given her\nmatching cribs in which Harod and Ardee snored, blissfully unaware of the\ndanger they were in. They had supplied her with all the soaps and scents,\npowders and paints, wigs and dresses the most exacting socialite might\nneed for a grand public appearance. They had even sent for her old maids\nFreid and Metello to help her prepare. It reminded Savine a little of happier\ntimes, before she was a Lady Governor, before she betrayed the king, before\nthe Great Change came. Except that Lisbit was dead and Zuri was in prison.\nShe winced at that thought. They tortured people suspected of hoarding\nflour. What might they do to someone accused of being a flesh-eating\nsorcerer in the service of the Prophet? Haroon and Rabik, too, who had\nfollowed her so faithfully. Had their loyalty landed them in fathoms of\nchain? It was insane. It was laughable. But in the current climate, the insane\nand laughable could quickly turn fatal.\nSavine closed her eyes and took a shuddering breath. She had charges of\nher own to answer. Some almost as insane and laughable as those against\nZuri and her brothers. Others all too horribly true. She had to fight for\nherself first. If they found her guilty, she could help no one.\n“This one?” asked Metello, in her thick Styrian accent.\nShe had a dress over one arm, a great swag of bright blue Suljuk silk\nwith Osprian lace at the cuffs and embroidered flowers all around the hem.\nIt had been made for an appearance at the theatre, she thought, but never\nworn. That colour had always seemed to be trying too hard.\nSavine waved it away. “By the Fates, no.”\nJudge hoped to swindle her with good treatment. To put her off guard\nwith familiar luxuries. To coax her into appearing at the trial as her old self.\nThe personification of the ruthless, exploitative, privileged elite that the\nGreat Change had set out to destroy.\nShe had even furnished Savine with jewels. Some excellent earrings and\na very fine ruby necklace, no doubt taken as bribes from some ex-lord’s\nwife in return for a pardon that never came. Judge did not really do pardons,\nnot even for rubies as fine as these. Savine put a finger under them and held\nthem to the light, admiring their bloody sparkle. Then she slid the stand\nfirmly away.\nJudge might very well be sending her to the Tower of Chains, but she\nwas a damn fool if she thought Savine would be helping. “Let’s keep it very\nsimple, ladies. Very clean and very humble. No jewels and no wig.” Metello\ngave an upset cluck, frowning at Savine’s own fuzz of clipped brown hair.\n“No silk and no—”\nThere was a crash outside and Savine spun towards the door, took a\nlurching step for the children, one hand pressed to her churning stomach,\nthe other reaching for the cribs."

Nipple-chewing, dung-leaking, sleep-\nkilling monsters with no conversation at all. But she was even more terrified\nfor them than for herself.\nLaughter beyond the door. Another crash, then cheery voices burbling\noff into silence. Just the Burners, doing what Burners do. Savine forced the\npanic away. Forced her clutching hand down, then turned in surprise at a\ngreat sob. Freid stood with her face screwed up, shoulders shaking.\n“Whatever is it?” demanded Savine. If anyone should have been\nweeping, she rather thought she had the best claim. She had scarcely slept\nsince they arrested her. It felt as if only the savagely laced corsetry was\nkeeping her standing.\n“When all this happened… the Great Change, I mean…” Freid’s bottom\nlip trembled, then she blurted it out. “I thought it might be a good thing! It\nseemed to be, for a while, freedom and all, and folk so happy, but then…”\nShe stared into the corner, eyes brimming. “But then… by the Fates, my\nlady, forgive me!”\nSavine’s first impulse was to slap her. She knew she would be lucky to\nsee sunset and did not particularly want to spend the hours she had left\nsoothing a wardrobe maid’s regrets. How she missed Zuri. She had never\ncried. Even when they dragged her away in a muzzle. But we must work\nwith the tools we have, as Savine’s father had been so fond of saying. She\nforced down her anger and put a gentle hand on Freid’s shoulder.\n“There is nothing to forgive,” she said, with an effort. “Perhaps it could\nhave been a good thing. Should have been. And I am not a lady any more.\nJust plain Citizeness. That is what I need people to see.”\nFreid sniffed back her tears and picked up the powder. “I’ll cover up\nyour scar—”\n“No,” said Savine, looking at it in the mirror, running pink and crooked\nup her forehead and into her clipped hair. “Get the blusher. Bring it out a\nlittle. Let them see that I know what pain is. We never met Savine dan\nGlokta, terror of the salons, you understand? Have them put the Darling of\nthe Slums on trial.”\n“So?” asked Metello, holding up one of her nursing dresses, plain white.\n“Perfect.”\nA clonking knock on the door brought another surge of sick terror.\n“It’s Gunnar Broad,” came the rough voice from outside.\n“Should I tell him you’re dressing?” whispered Freid.\nSavine pressed on her stomach again. Smothered the fear, again. One\nadvantage of facing your death was that modesty did not seem so heavy a\nconsideration. She raised her voice so it could be well understood beyond\nthe door. “Gunnar Broad saved my life in Valbeck after I was chased half-"

I doubt the sight of my petticoat will scandalise him.\nAnd he’s got the key, after all!”\nThe doorknob turned and the door swung open, leaving Broad framed in\nthe doorway, huge, armoured, red-eyed. He took a heavy step into the room.\nHe frowned towards the children. He frowned towards Freid and she shrank\nbehind the dressing table. He frowned towards Savine.\nHe looked ill, drunk, furious and sentimental all at once. The definitive\nBurner, in fact. As if he couldn’t decide whether to beg her forgiveness or\nsmash her face in.\n“You’ve got one hour,” he said, turning back towards the door.\n“I appreciate the reminder. And I have something for you.” Savine held\nthe folded paper out to him. “From Liddy.”\nHis slack face twitched at the name. “Liddy can’t write.”\n“I suppose May must have written it. It came with some dispatches from\nLeo’s mother.”\nBroad’s jaw worked, his bloodshot eyes fixed on the letter, his hand\nhalfway towards it. “What does it say?”\n“Don’t be ridiculous, Gunnar, I don’t read letters that aren’t addressed to\nme. Honestly. You’ll be telling me Zuri eats people next.”\nShe pressed the letter carelessly into his hand and turned back to her\npowder, but she studied him in the mirror. He stared down at that paper for\na long moment, then walked very slowly to the door, and pulled it very\nslowly shut. Savine clenched her jaw and made a trembling fist. She might\nbe going off the Tower of Chains—the Fates knew, the odds were against\nher—but she would not be going without a fight.\nFreid was over one of the cribs, cooing gently to Harod. “Do you want\nme to take the children?” Her eyes were getting moist again. “I mean…\nwhen they put you in the dock—”\n“I may need you to take them…” Savine lost her voice for a moment,\nhad to clear her throat. “When I am condemned.” It was better to say when\nthan if. She did not dare to say if. “Until that moment, in the court, in the\ndock… they come with me.”\nThis was not a trial. It was a show. And Savine knew how to put on a\nshow. No one better.\nAdua was hidden behind a rise, but you could see the great shadow of its\nsmoke from miles around.\n“The furnaces are still lit,” said Jurand.\n“No matter how you try,” murmured Leo, “you can’t stop progress.”\nLord Marshal Forest squinted up at the sun, providing some actual\nwarmth for what felt like the first time in months. “Don’t like marching in\nthe open like this.”\n“If you can call it marching.” The drums were beating double time but\nthe demoralised remains of the People’s Army and the exhausted remnants\nof the Crown Prince’s Division moved at a trudge, their ranks dissolved into\na shambling mass, flags limp and polearms drooping, a trail of mud and"

A giant military slug, squirming spent across the\ndamp country. “They hardly look ready for a fight.”\n“They’re not,” said Glaward. “We’ve lost more deserters without\nfighting than we’d ever have lost casualties if we had.”\nLeo looked to the few well-drilled blocks of dark-uniformed cavalry\ntowards the front. “At least we can rely on the Anglanders.”\n“They’re with you to the death,” said Jurand.\nGlaward clapped a heavy hand on Leo’s shoulder. “And so are we.” For\na fond moment, it felt almost like old times.\nForest was fretting at his frayed cuffs as he stared towards that smear on\nthe sky. “They must know we’re coming.”\n“They believe we’re killing each other miles away,” said Leo. “And\nInspector Teufel is making sure the People’s Inspectorate won’t be putting\nanyone straight on that score.”\n“You trust her?” asked Forest.\n“No,” said Leo. “But trust is a poor foundation for an alliance. I’ve\nfound to my cost the woman’s damned effective.”\n“Even so. You can’t keep thousands of soldiers secret for long.”\n“Who’s this?” Glaward spurred in front of Leo, hand on his sword. A\ncouple of Forest’s scouts were leading a dishevelled horse by the bridle, a\ndishevelled prisoner in the saddle with hands tied behind him.\n“Caught this article on the road ahead, Lord Marshal!” one of them\ncalled out.\n“Caught me?” squawked the prisoner. “I was bloody trying to find you!\nI’ve a message from Corporal Tunny!”\nForest grinned. “That article’s called Yolk, and I’m sorry to say he’s on\nour side. Let him free.”\nOnce he had his hands back the man gave a slovenly salute. “It’s Lord\nBrock I need to speak to. I mean to say… are you lords again, now? It’s all\n—”\n“Out with it,” snapped Leo.\n“It’s your wife. She’s… well, there’s no easy way to say it…”\n“Take the hard way, then.”\n“They’ve arrested her. Judge is putting her on trial for profiteering and\ntreason and… er…” Yolk swallowed. “Well, incest got a mention.”\nSilence. Behind them the drums, and the tramping boots, and the clatter\nof gear went on. Leo wondered how he ought to feel. Would be expected to\nfeel. He bunched his good hand into a fist. “When?”\n“Today. The king’ll be there. Hell, half the city’ll be there, it’s set to be\nthe biggest execution since Risinau went off the Tower… that is to say…”\n“We’ll get there in time,” said Jurand. “Don’t worry. We’ll get there.”\n“I know,” muttered Leo. It was terrible news, of course. His wife was in\ndanger. His children. He made sure everyone could see how deeply he felt\nit. Terrible news. But he couldn’t help seeing an upside. The Burners would\nbe distracted. It might give them an opening."

His Majesty’s safety has to come first.”\n“They’ll both be at the Court of the People,” said Leo. “Save one, we\nsave the other.”\nJurand frowned back towards the sleepwalking soldiers. “We’ll save no\none limping along like this.”\n“Agreed,” said Forest.\n“If I learned one thing at Stoffenbeck,” said Leo, “it’s that you’ll do no\ngood with bad men. Lord Marshal, I suggest you pick out two hundred men\nyou fully trust, the best armed and mounted. Your most loyal. When we\nmake it through Arnault’s Wall—”\n“If we make it.”\n“When we make it, Glaward and your officers can spread the rest out\nthrough Adua. Secure the gates, the docks, the bridges, the squares and\ncrossroads, hold down the city for its own safety. We’ll rush my best men\nand yours straight for the Agriont and take the south gate. Free the king\nbefore they know we’re coming.”\nForest grimly nodded. “And you wife, too.”\nLeo frowned towards the great pall of smoke on the horizon. Could he\nsee the pinpricks of Adua’s tallest towers, peeking over the grassy rise? The\nHouse of the Maker? The highest chimneys? Perhaps even the roof of the\nTower of Chains… “And my wife, too.”\nSavine would understand. She used to love a gamble, after all.\n“Tight enough,” squeaked Gorst, and Vick pulled the strap through the\nbuckle and gave his backplate a thump with her fist. Felt like the right thing\nto do when helping a man on with his armour. Not that she’d know. Helping\nmen in and out of their clothes was something she’d done less than she’d\nhave liked, down the years.\n“Brock and Forest are on their way,” she said.\n“Will they get here in time?”\nVick could only shrug. No idea how long they’d take to get to the city.\nNo idea what resistance they’d face once they got in. No idea how long the\ntrial might last. Far too many variables, all way outside her control. While\nGorst slid his mirror-polished steels into their sheaths, she pushed the\nsquares board aside and spread out the map, staring at it as if some answer\nmight suddenly reveal itself in invisible ink.\n“I bought off the guards at the gates in Casamir’s Wall, and Arnault’s.\nWith any luck our friends can march straight through. The gate of the\nAgriont is the problem.” And she tapped at the citadel’s south gate. Always\nthe weakest point in a weak plan. “They blew up some bits of the wall but\nnot enough to make a difference, and Judge has her most loyal men\nguarding it. Too risky to bribe.

I spin the guards a story about worries over their loyalty,\ntry to get at least a couple out, then… we deal with the rest. We bar the\ndoor. We hold it till the Young Lion’s cavalry arrives.”\nGorst nodded slowly. He didn’t say whether he thought it was a good\nplan or a bad. He didn’t have to. Vick already knew it was a terrible plan.\nShe just hadn’t been able to think of a better one.\n“Timing’ll be tight,” she murmured, taking the neat row of weapons\nfrom the table one by one and sliding them into their various sheaths,\npockets, hiding places. “Go too late, they’ll be ready, no way we’ll capture\nthe room. Go too early, even if we capture the room, we might’ve lost it by\nthe time Brock gets there.” She thought about that a moment. “And we’ll\nprobably be dead.”\nGorst had shaved his head again, and he ran a hand over the silvery\nstubble on his scalp with a faint hissing. “How many men?”\n“The usual detail…” Vick licked her lips. “Is eight.”\nGorst made no comment. She doubted he’d have flinched if she’d said a\nthousand.\n“That seem a lot to you?” she asked.\n“It is what it is. Are you willing to kill?”\nHearing it like that, so blunt and brutal, made her wonder. “I understand\nthe stakes,” she said, slapping her dagger into her boot-sheath. “I’ll do what\nneeds doing. If you can handle the other seven.”\nShe’d meant it as a joke, but he didn’t smile. “Fewer would be better.”\nThe fact was, with only the two of them, this wouldn’t be easy. She\ncould’ve asked Tallow along, but she told herself he’d only get in the way.\nShe could’ve hired men, but there was no one she trusted.\n“Story of my life,” she muttered, under her breath. Too much trust could\nkill you in a heartbeat. She’d learned that lesson in the camps. Learned it\ntoo well, maybe, because now it seemed too little trust could kill you just as\ndead. Only it happened slowly, during years spent alone and looking over\nyour shoulder.\nStill, if you could only bring one man to a fight with the future of the\nUnion hanging on the outcome, she reckoned Bremer dan Gorst a good\npick. He pulled the Constable’s greatcoat on with some difficulty. The\nbiggest one she’d been able to find, and still he was close to ripping it at the\nshoulders, breastplate glinting above the top button, lumps of his many\nweapons clearly showing.\n“I have never been subtle,” he said, sheepishly.\n“With any luck, folk will be looking elsewhere.” Vick shoved the mace\nthrough her belt, and she was ready. “I hear Judge means to make a show of\nthis one.”\nWe Know Who You Are\nO\nrso sat on his stool in his cage in the Court of the People and sweated,"

        "text": "this one.”\nWe Know Who You Are\nO\nrso sat on his stool in his cage in the Court of the People and sweated,\nand waited, and worried. It had been a while since he’d done much else.\nOver the past few weeks, the audiences had thinned out and grown ever\nmore jaded. He had seen trials in which the observers were outnumbered by\nthe accused. He had seen crumbs shower down from people enjoying a\nquick pastry in the gallery while blood-curdling accusations were made. He\nhad seen elderly Representatives nod off on their benches as young mothers\npleaded for their lives.\nBut today was different. The galleries were crammed, the benches\noverflowing. For the first time in a long time the sun shone outside, slashing\nthe Court of the People and its squinting occupants with long strips of\nbrightness. An eager babble filled the chamber to the highest point of its\nslogan-splattered dome with an air of breathless expectation. This was\ngoing to be an event.\nOrso worked his stool over to the corner of his cage. As close as he\ncould get to Hildi, sitting cross-legged on the tiled floor outside with her\nback against the bars.\n“Where the hell’s the Young Lion?” he whispered through fixed lips. Not\nso very long ago, before the battle at Stoffenbeck, he had spent several\nsleepless nights hoping Brock never arrived. Now he was desperate for the\nleast hint of the bastard.\nHildi glanced towards Corporal Halder, but he and the rest of Orso’s\nguards had long ago given up any pretence of guarding and had slunk into\none of the patches of sunlight to bask like lizards, not paying the slightest\nattention. “They’re on their way,” she hissed from the corner of her mouth.\n“What if they don’t get here in time?” He was all too keenly aware how\nquickly the Court of the People could produce a verdict. “What if\nSavine’s… convicted?”\n“Then I’ve seen it happen to better people.”\nOrso could hardly deny that, despite for some reason desperately\nwanting to. “My worry is it’ll happen to a worse next,” he whispered.\n“Namely me.”\nHildi was showing depressingly little sign of disagreeing when Judge\nswept into the hall, chains on her breastplate twinkling, hem of her ripped\nballgown hissing across the tiles and sending washes of dust motes through\nthe bars of sunlight. Sworbreck, Broad, Sarlby and a few dozen of the most\ncommitted Burners stalked up in her wake. The hubbub dropped away into\nthe usual awful quiet as the Union’s vengeful nightmare lowered herself\ninto the chair once reserved for Orso, picked up her smith’s hammer and\ngave the already ruined High Table a brutal beating.\n“Court is in fucking session!” she snarled.\nOrso tried to flap some air into his collar. For months he had hardly been\nable to remember what warmth felt like. Now the Court of the People was\nsmotheringly hot. Hot with the spring sun flashing and twinkling through\nthe distorting windows. Hot with the excited breath of the crowd. Hot with\nrumour, gossip, scandal, fear. The only cool thing in the whole place, as the\ngreat doors were swung open, was the defendant."

The only cool thing in the whole place, as the\ngreat doors were swung open, was the defendant.\nSavine wore a plain nursing dress, pure white. No jewels. No wig. Her\ndark hair was clipped close to her skull so she looked shorn of all pretence,\nthe scar up her forehead showing red. Orso had never seen her look so\nbeautiful. But then he thought that every time he saw her, with tiresome\npredictability. He gripped the bars of his cage, face all but pressed to the\nmetal as she passed.\nHe wanted to call out some encouragement. Be strong! or You’ll beat the\nbastards! or I love you! but she did not meet his eye. She glided across the\ntiled floor with her hands clasped and her head high, a member of some\nmore virtuous species than the sweaty mass gathered on the benches and in\nthe galleries. Two maids followed, each carrying what looked like a little\nbundle of blankets.\n“Are those her children?” muttered Hildi, sitting up. One of the bundles\ntwisted, made a little mew, and Orso caught a glimpse of its tiny baffled\nface as it was whisked past.\n“Bloody hell,” he breathed as a murmur went through the crowd. Were\nthey… his niece and nephew, then? The thought made him feel vaguely\nnauseous.\nSworbreck, in his blood-red prosecutor’s suit, gazed at them with open\ndisdain. “Babies are not permitted in the Court of the People!”\n“My innocence may stand in question,” Savine’s voice rang out with no\ntrace of fear, “but what crime have my children committed that they should\nbe separated from their mother?”\nUsually insults would shower on the accused, sometimes bits of food,\ncoins and broken glass, on one memorable occasion a bucket of piss, but the\nmood was different today. The murmur from above was of approval.\nSupport, even. It seemed there was almost as much admiration for Savine’s\nquiet dignity in the public galleries as there was in Orso’s cage. He could\nnot suppress the slightest smile, the slightest shake of his fist. In the Court\nof the People, one had to celebrate small victories.\nBut Judge lazily waved it away. “They’re Citizens, too, ain’t they? All\nare equal and everyone’s welcome.” She slumped back in her chair, lifted\nher legs and let her bare feet drop on the table with a final-sounding thud.\n“It’s not as if it’ll change the result.”\nThat was painfully clear to someone who had watched the court send\nhundreds to their deaths, heedless of proof or process. Savine might bring\nthe cunning of Glustrod, the dignity of Juvens, the will of Euz himself and\nperch on a mountain of babies in an ocean of sympathy. Orso could not see\nhow it might make the slightest difference. Only the timely arrival of\nseveral thousand armed men could do that.\nSavine gave her children a final touch then swept into the dock as calmly\nas she might have her box at the theatre.

He had to find some way to buy time.\nJudge bashed away for order, then tossed her hammer rattling down.\n“Bar all the doors!” she shrieked. “I want no fucking distractions!”\nAnd a breathless silence closed in.\n“Citizeness Brock!” Sworbreck swaggered towards Savine in his absurd\nscarlet coat, a sheaf of papers flapping in one hand. It appeared the\npompous dolt had duped himself with his own play-acting and come to\nbelieve he really was the great legal mind of the age.\n“You stand accused of epic profiteering, grand usury, consorting with\nenemies of the Union and conspiracy against the Great Change!” He\ndelivered the charges like the famous final lines of a much-loved play, and\nwith the same expectation of applause. But Savine’s old partner Citizen\nVallimir must have carried out her instructions to the letter: stuffing the\ngalleries with people who had benefitted from her charity and paying\neveryone else to act as if they had. Now, as the echoes of Sworbreck’s\naccusations faded into sullen silence, her final investment paid dividends\nand the faces of the public squashed in at the balconies glared down on the\nprosecutor with chilly hostility.\nShe had practised her pose in the mirror. Calibrated it with minute care.\nDefiant, but not arrogant. Dignified, but not proud. Now that the waiting\nwas over and the battle was joined her fear had vanished. In spite of the\nfeverish heat she felt icy calm. She did not respond to the charges. She\nimplied the charges were beneath a response.\nSworbreck cleared his throat, worked his mouth, then gathered himself\nfor another sally, jabbing at her with an accusing finger. “You look a picture\nof modesty today, I note! Those of us familiar with your public displays are\nused to seeing you swathed in silks and dripping diamonds. Your name is\nsynonymous with exhibitions of ostentation! It seems you are a mistress of\ndisguise.

You pretend to be a humble\nCitizeness of the Union like any other. You hide your infamous history\nbehind your husband’s celebrated name.” He appealed again to the\ngalleries. “But we know who you are! You are none other than Savine dan\nGlokta, the notorious… the notorious… whatever are you doing?”\nShe was, in fact, unbuttoning the front of her dress. “Quite obviously,\nCitizen Sworbreck, I am tending to the needs of my children.”\nA murmur spread around the court as she undid her nursing corset and"

        "text": "Citizen Sworbreck, I am tending to the needs of my children.”\nA murmur spread around the court as she undid her nursing corset and\nworked one breast out. Sworbreck glanced quickly away, colour spreading\nacross his cheeks. Knowing him for a fool and coward, it was no surprise to\ndiscover he was also a prude. “I hardly think… this is the place—”\n“What better place?” She snapped her fingers for Freid to pass Ardee up\nto her. “The Great Change freed us all!” She settled her daughter on her\nbreast and, heroic little thing, she set to feeding right away. “And yet ever\nsince, I have received many lectures on the proper responsibilities of a\nCitizeness. Motherhood is always chief among them. Outside these very\nwindows there is a statue several storeys high of Nature nourishing the\nyoung of the world. Should I reject her lesson? Should I abandon my\nresponsibilities to my children simply because my life hangs in the balance?\nShould I reject the tenets of the Great Change, here at its very heart, in the\nCourt of the People? No, Citizen Sworbreck, I refuse! I will nurture them\nuntil my dying breath.”\nThere was actual applause. Scattered, but applause. Perhaps she had\nstruck a nerve with some of the mothers in attendance. Judge brought it to a\nhalt with a few blows of her hammer, though, glowering towards the\ngalleries. “Nurture away,” she growled. “It’s your own guilt that concerns\nus here today. Fucking proceed!”\n“Of course, Citizeness Judge, of course.” Sworbreck rifled through his\npapers, which Savine would not have been surprised to find were blank,\ntrying to recover his lost rhythm. “To the, er… to the specific charges, then!\nYou were a leading light and founding member of that coven of profiteers,\nthe Solar Society!”\n“I am proud to say so,” said Savine. “A beacon of progress intended to\nbring prosperity to all.”\n“Hear, hear,” she heard Curnsbick grunt from the benches behind her.\nNot loud, but loud enough.\n“You have conspired with others to claw profits from the common man!”\nshrieked Sworbreck.\n“I have partnered with others to build things where there was nothing\nbefore.”\n“Indeed,” she heard Kort say from among the Representatives.\n“You have long plotted against the Union with foreign agents!”\nSworbreck’s voice cracked, went suddenly shrill, and he had to clear his\nthroat. “With savage Northmen and degenerate Styrians! You have\nharboured Gurkish spies in your own house!”\n“I have done business across the Circle of the World and cultivated\nfriendships wherever I could find them. My only plots were alongside men\nof good conscience, to bring down the Union’s callous government.”\n“True, true,” called Isher, always reliable in his own defence.\nThere was a steady grumble from the galleries now. Sworbreck dabbed a\ngreasy sheen from his forehead. “Workers were exploited in your mills,\nmutilated in your manufactories, all but enslaved in service of your\ninsatiable greed!”\n“Workers were given jobs, fair wages and a chance to better themselves.\nNo one was forced into anything.” She eased her breast back into her corset"

        "text": "insatiable greed!”\n“Workers were given jobs, fair wages and a chance to better themselves.\nNo one was forced into anything.” She eased her breast back into her corset\nand scooped out the other.\nSworbreck gave an ungainly cough, staring down at his notes as she\nsettled Ardee again. The girl could have fed through an earthquake. “You\nhave participated in usury on a grand scale! Squeezed outrageous rents from\nthe desperate! Lived like an empress while your tenants squatted in filth!\nYou have conspired with the Banking House of Valint and Balk—”\n“No!” she barked. “I have never taken money from Valint and Balk. Not\none mark. Not one bit. Accuracy is important in a court of law, don’t you\nthink?”\nSworbreck was wrongfooted. He had clearly never had to deal with a\ndefendant who was actually given the chance to defend themselves. He\nsquinted into the sunlight, was obliged to shade his eyes awkwardly with\nhis papers. “Then… well… how would you prove it?”\n“I have not your legal expertise, Citizen Sworbreck, but I believe the\nburden of proof lies with the prosecution.” Some light laughter from the\npublic gallery. She shifted Ardee against her breast. “I could easily furnish\nevidence, however…” She knew she had to stay calm but could not quite\nkeep the edge of contempt off her voice. “Had you not locked up my\nbookkeeper on charges of being a sorceress.”\nThe laughter was louder this time.\n“Bitch is making fucking fools of us,” snarled Sarlby. “And with her tits.\nShe pay these bastards off or something?”\nBroad would’ve been shocked if she hadn’t. He’d warned Judge it was a\nmistake to give Savine a chance to speak. But she’d been fixed on a big\ndisplay. On humbling her as well as punishing her. Wasn’t quite turning out\nthat way. But all he cared about was the letter. It felt heavy in his sweaty\nhand. Like a square of hot iron.\nHe couldn’t stop thinking about Liddy and May. All the things he’d done\nsince he last saw them. How they might look at him now. Their\ndisappointment. Their downright horror. He wasn’t even drunk. His flask\nsat untouched in his pocket but his head was still spinning.\nSworbreck was getting booed. Properly booed, like an old show that had\nstarted boring its audience. The Burners were looking uneasy. Bannerman\nstood near the dock, arms folded, frowning worried towards the galleries.\nBroad ripped the letter open. He could hardly remember what May’s\nwriting looked like. Wasn’t as if he was the best reader, even with his\nlenses. His eyes were swimming. The Court of the People faded. The nervy\nburble of Sworbreck’s questions, the cool snap of Savine’s answers,\nSarlby’s grumbling and the swelling gabble of the public galleries, it all\nfaded.\nHe heard Liddy’s voice when he read it. He heard May’s.\nGunnar. Father.\nWe hear you are in trouble. We hear you have lost yourself. We miss\nyou. Every day we miss you.\nWe know who you are. Our husband. Our father. A good man. You"

You\njust have to remember.\nWe hope every day that we see you again soon.\nYour family,\nLiddy and May.\nA good man. Something pattered on the paper and made the ink run. A\ndrop of sweat off his forehead, surely. He crumpled the letter in his fist,\npulled off his lenses and wiped his face on the tattooed back of his hand. It\nwas trembling.\n“And now,” Sworbreck was screeching, “you would have us believe that\nyou have turned all your undoubted cunning towards charitable projects?\nThat the great exploiter has become a great philanthropist!”\n“I opened my house to orphans,” answered Savine, her voice turning\nsharper, “and in the slums I try to give bread and coal to the needy. The\nFates know there are enough of them.”\n“Are there indeed?” Sworbreck had a sly smile. He thought he’d hooked\nher, like an angler with a record-breaking fish, and was pulling her in.\n“There are many for whom the Great Change has changed little,” said\nSavine. “People without work, without food, without fuel. The chasm\nbetween rich and poor yawns as wide as ever. I simply try my best to bridge\nthe divide.”\nSworbreck was triumphant. “Do you presume to say so?”\n“No,” said Savine. “You do.”\n“What?”\nShe reached under her nursing baby to slip something out. Stained,\nworn, cheap paper tattered at the edges. But the name of its author had been\nprinted in very large type. Large enough for all the court to see.\n“The Darling of the Slums,” said Savine, “by Spillion Sworbreck.”\nBroad remembered the day that pamphlet was written, out in the Three\nFarms, and he gave a disbelieving snort. You had to admire the gall of it.\n“I… well…” Sworbreck had turned almost as red as his suit. “I’m not…\nsure I recall—”\n“Let me refresh your memory by reading a typical passage.” Savine\nflipped the pamphlet open, and while rocking her baby began to read. “‘As\nLady Brock moves through those darkened streets, it is as if a beacon\nshines. Lighting the way to a better life for these neglected unfortunates. As\nif the sun breaks through the smoke of the manufactories. She gives out\nbread, yes, she gives out wisdom, surely, she gives out silver with an open\nhand, but more valuable than all, she gives out hope.’ You praised my\ncharity and selflessness.” She glanced back at the pamphlet. “My apologies.\nMy remarkable charity and selflessness.” She lifted her brows. “Are you\ncalling yourself a liar?”\nThere was a cheer from the public gallery. Folk were on their feet up\nthere. Even some of the Representatives clapped. King Orso thumped the\nbars of his cage in glee and made the door rattle.\n“Long live the Darling o’ the Slums!” someone roared from the highest\nbalcony.\nBroad had never seen Judge look more furious, and fury was what she"

Seeing her prosecutor hated was one thing. Seeing him\nmocked was something else.\n“Bitch is making fucking fools of us!” snarled Sarlby.\nThe letter was half-crushed in Broad’s fist, a few words of May’s writing\nshowing.\nWe know who you are.\nLeo couldn’t swing a sword like he used to, but a trained warhorse is a hell\nof a weapon. He spurred through the open gate, face fixed in that mad\nmixture of smile and snarl he used to wear charging into battle. He caught a\nglimpse of wide eyes, gripped saddle and reins as a man was trampled\nunder his horse’s hooves, another flung against the wall leaving a dash of\nred on the stones.\nLeo wasn’t sure whether they’d been armed or not. Only that they’d be\nwielding the most terrifying weapons you ever saw in the painting he’d\nhave made of this moment.\nOther riders were bursting through the archway, surging around him and\ninto the city. Teufel’s gold had done most of the job, but there was still work\nto do with steel. Still some Breakers and Burners fixed on fighting.\n“Shoot those bastards!” he roared, pointing up the street towards two\nrunning figures. Jurand took aim from the saddle, brought one down at a\nrange of twenty paces.\n“Shot!” snapped Leo, wishing he had a hand free so he could clap him\non the shoulder. More flatbows rattled. The other man staggered on a few\nsteps then sank moaning to his knees in the street.\n“Move!” Forest was bellowing, hooves clattering on cobbles as he\nwaved mounted men through the gate. “Move!” Leo wondered whether\nthere’d be room for him in the painting. A strong leader and an honourable\nman. Somewhere in the back, maybe. “On to the Agriont!”\nLeo leaned from his saddle to shout at Glaward. “Move south towards\nthe docks. Spread out, take charge of the city. Anyone who resists, arrest\nthem.”\n“If they won’t be arrested?”\n“We can’t afford to let anyone get in the way. Do you understand?”\nGlaward swallowed. “I understand.” He was a good man, too, in his\nway, but too soft-hearted to ever really be in the foreground.\nA threadbare battle flag was already being hoisted over the gatehouse,\nthe golden sun catching the breeze and flying boldly for the first time since\nthe Great Change. Leo grinned up at it. Certainly there’d be room for that\non the canvas.\n“What shall we do with these?” Jurand nodded towards a row of men\nbeing dragged from the gatehouse and shoved sullen onto their knees.\n“Keep them prisoner,” said Leo. “We’ll deal with them when this is\nsettled.”\n“Might be safer to hang them now.” Jurand had become less sentimental\nthan ever, recently. As though Leo’s new ruthlessness had given him\npermission. “We don’t want to send the wrong message.”\n“Exactly.” Leo nodded towards scared faces at the windows. “Folk have\nseen enough executions. We have to show them we’ve come to stop all"

We have to show them we’ve come to stop all\nthat.” He smiled up at a little girl. A glimpse of that Young Lion charm. “We\ncan hang the bastards later. In private.”\n“Think we’ll have trouble at the Agriont?” Forest frowned towards the\nfar\nend of the square, where the outline of the House of the Maker showed\nabove the rooftops. “If they don’t know we’re coming already, they soon\nwill.”\n“We’ll have to trust Inspector Teufel to open the gates.”\n“We bet everything on a woman who lies for a living?”\n“It’s an upside-down world, all right.” And Leo bared his teeth as he\nspurred across the square. His stump was on fire from the hard riding, but\nhe couldn’t stop, not now. The future of the Union would be settled in the\nnext few hours. He’d made himself a promise that he’d never again be on a\nlosing side.\n“Ready?” asked Vick.\nGorst’s eyes gleamed in the shadows. “Ready.”\nShe fixed her face in the frown of a People’s Chief Inspector in a hell of\na mood and shoved open the door of the chain room.\nIt was a cluttered, confusing place. Light shone inwards from slit\nwindows at either end but upwards, too, from slots in the floor that looked\nonto the entrance passage below. The hanging chains, gears and\nmechanisms, racks of spears and armour, the wrist-thick gratings of the\nthree raised portcullises, all cast tricking shadows. But it soon became clear\nthere weren’t the eight men in there Vick had expected. There were only\nfour.\nIt seemed there might be such a thing as good luck after all.\n“You!” snapped Vick at the most dangerous-looking of them—a big,\ncrop-haired bastard with cauliflower ears and a red smear across his jerkin.\n“What’s your name?”\nHe glanced at the others, nervously licking his lips, but found no way\nout. “Corporal Smiler?” he muttered, as if he wasn’t completely sure.\n“Smiler?” she growled. “Is that a joke?”\n“No! They started calling me that in Styria, ’cause I never smiled, and I\nguess it stuck, and…” He tried a weak smile on her and, indeed, was very\nbad at it. He cleared his throat and stood to attention. “I’m eager to help,\nInspector!”\n“Someone had better. Commissioner Pike has concerns about the loyalty\nof the men stationed here.”\n“You’ll find no one more dedicated!” spluttered one with an oddly\nlopsided face.\n“The Great Change!” shouted another, holding up his fist. As Vick\nturned to glare at him, he cleared his throat and hid it behind his back.\n“Aren’t there meant to be eight of you?” she asked, frowning around as\nif she was looking for weaknesses to put right, rather than ones she could\nexploit.\nCorporal Smiler cleared his throat again, his thick neck shifting. “Well,\nnormally—”\n“So where are the rest?”\n“I guess… watching the trial…”\nVick gave him a few breaths to stew in his worry.

His fellows were\neasing away from him, like you might from a man infected. One was trying\nto hide behind a portcullis, failing to realise the essence of a portcullis is\nthat you can see right through it. “Who’s in charge here?” Vick snapped at\nhim.\n“Sergeant Hambeck!” No doubts now he was naming someone else. If\nthere was one thing everybody knew how to do these days, it was denounce.\n“Don’t tell me. He’s watching the trial.”\n“They say this one’ll likely be a real zinger, so we drew lots and—”\n“You two, go and fetch him. Now.”\n“Right away!” squeaked Smiler, grabbing his friend from behind the\nportcullis and hurrying for the door, Gorst pressing himself against the wall\nto let them past.\nAnd as easily as that, the odds were even. Only two guards: the lopsided\none and an older one with a beard, frowning at Gorst as if he couldn’t quite\nplace him.\n“You!” she snapped, bringing his head snapping towards her. “Show me\nthe windlasses.”\n“The windlasses, Inspector?”\n“I need to check they haven’t been sabotaged,” she said, while\nwondering what the best way to sabotage them would be.\n“Sabotaged, Inspector?”\nShe took a step towards him. “Is there an echo in here?”\n“It’s just… that’s silly.”\n“Really? Maybe you want to stand in the dock and tell Judge how silly it\nis?”\nIt was plain from his face that he didn’t. “The first one’s here,” he\ncroaked, ducking under a couple of low-hanging chains to lead her over.\n“Ain’t that complicated. This thing with the handles like a ship’s wheel, you\nturn that to raise it, those are gears for the weight, but it still takes three\nstrong men to lift one o’ these bastards, believe me…” Vick could hardly\nhear him over the thudding of her own heart as she slid the mace from her\nbelt. She tried not to look at the scarf he was wearing. A nice patterned one,\nthe kind a wife knits for a husband or a daughter for a father. She focused\non his bald spot instead. Few grey hairs there. Didn’t want to kill him, but\nin her experience it was far better to hit a man too hard than not hard\nenough. “Push this here lever to drop it in an attack—”\nThe mace made a meaty crunch as Vick smashed him across the back of\nthe head. He crumpled over the windlass, blood squirting from a ragged\ngash across his scalp, sprinkling across the chains, the gears, the floor.\nShe heard a muffled cry from the other end of the room. Saw vague\nshapes shifting in the shadows. Then one dropped and Gorst stood there,\nshort steel gleaming red.\n“Oh.” The bearded one was pushing himself up from the windlass, blood\nrunning down his face in regular spurts and soaking into his scarf. “My\nhead’s all—”\nShe smashed him across the side of the skull, even harder.

So hard she\nknocked him back upright, spinning on one heel, tumbling into the\nportcullis and crashing down on his back, thrashing like a landed fish,\nfoaming at the mouth in some kind of wild fit. His kicking leg lashed out\nand knocked a rack of spears clattering across the floor.\nShe tossed her mace as she dropped on top of him, struggling to pin him\ndown. “Help me hold the bastard—”\nThere was a sharp crack as Gorst nailed him through the top of his\nbroken head with his short steel. The man flopped down, suddenly still.\nVick rocked back on her haunches. “Shit,” she whispered. She should’ve\nknown limiting the violence would be a forlorn hope. But it looked like\ntheir luck had held. They had the chain room, and that was the part that had\nworried her most. The place was designed to be held even if the walls\naround it were taken. Now they just had to lock themselves in—\nThere was a boy standing in the doorway, staring wide-eyed at Gorst and\nVick, both of them covered in blood and kneeling over a dead Burner.\nShe struggled up. “Wait there!”\nThe boy bolted like a ferret. By the time she’d made it to the corridor,\nthe only sign of him was the fading echoes of his slapping feet.\n“Shit!” she hissed again, but a good deal louder. She caught the edge of\nthe door, a good thickness of solid oak, and heaved it shut with a reassuring\nclunk. She reached for the bar to drop it into the thick brackets and froze.\nThere was no bar.\nThere was a hinge against the frame with a couple of dangling screws,\nbut the bar itself was gone. She cast wildly about in the shadows, but there\nwas no sign of it. Might be it got smashed when the Breakers took the\nAgriont. Or the Burners ripped it off along with the gates downstairs. It\nhardly mattered why it was gone. That boy would be bringing guards. Lots\nof guards. And soon.\n“There’s no bar!” she snarled.\n“Huh,” said Gorst, without emotion.\nIf there really was such a thing as good luck, it seemed there was a\nlimited supply.\nThe Side of the Saints\n“T\nhat’s it!” screamed Judge, springing up and smashing at the wounded\ntable so savagely she put a great split in it. “Fucking stop!”\nSavine had not paid enough for all the support that was coming from the\ngalleries. Some of it must have actually been heartfelt. People taking no\nsmall risk to show their honest feelings. She had worked all her life to be\nenvied. She had never imagined she might truly be liked.\n“Broad!” Judge showered spit, tendons starting from her hand as she\nshook her hammer towards the galleries. “Next bastard makes a sound, get\nup there and show ’em the quick way down!”\nBroad glared up, then towards Judge, then towards Savine.

The hall had fallen\nquiet as the grave. Being liked was very pleasant. But its limitations as a\nshield against terror were starkly revealed.\n“Any other cunt wants to lend support to our defendant can come down\nand join her in the dock.” Judge’s black eyes swept the balconies, the\nbenches. “No? No one?” A silence so complete it was a pressure on the ear.\n“Didn’t fucking think so.”\nSworbreck wrung his hands. “Citizeness Judge—”\n“Sit the shit down, you posturing dunce!” she snarled back at him.\n“’Fore I send you to the Tower ahead!”\nSworbreck sat.\nJudge turned her glare on Savine. “Let’s stop tickling the rim and come\nto the point. You’ve dressed like a nursemaid, and you’ve smiled at some\norphans, and you’ve handed out a blanket or two, congratulations. But you\nare Savine dan Glokta. You are the daughter of not one tyrant, but two, not\nto mention the sister of a third.”\n“Should I be punished for my birth?” she asked, but her voice was\ngiving out. It sounded thin.\n“I’ve seen folk convicted for less.” Judge nodded towards Orso’s cage.\n“But if you want weightier crimes, I understand you and the king knew\neach other a little better’n a brother and sister should.”\nIn spite of everything, she could not help looking at him. Could not help\nmeeting his eye. Could not help feeling the same as she always had.\nJudge followed the look between them, red brows high. “I mean to say,\nyou’ll find no broader minds than mine, but even I get itchy around incest.”\nSavine felt her face burning and knew she must look guilty as the\nplague. Knew she was guilty as the plague.\n“I never knew… he was…” She could not even finish the sentence.\n“Spare your blushes.” Judge waved a generous hand. “Put the brother-\nfucking to one side. Put all the rest in the best baby-nurturing, orphan-\nhousing, loaf-giving light you’ve got. Truth is you are a profiteer. You did\nexploit the working man, and woman, and child. You have built your\npalaces from their bones. You’re the worst o’ the old regime, squeezed into\nthe shape of a woman. You’re fucking guilty, girl, guilty as Glustrod, and I\nknow it, and you know it, and we all damn well know it.”\nSavine did know it. The list of people she had used unrolled pitilessly\nbefore her. The desperate supplicants at the Solar Society. The partners she\nhad bullied and blackmailed. The workers she had beaten and tortured. The\nchildren slaving in her mill in Valbeck. The soldiers buried in shallow\ngraves at Stoffenbeck.

What a waste it all seemed now. There is\nnothing at the summit, in the end, but a long drop.\nA different kind of murmur was coming from the galleries, and not\nnearly so friendly.\n“But this court is not without mercy!” called Judge, holding up a hand\nfor silence. “We see you’ve tried to make amends. We see you’ve done\nsome good. The same hands that clawed profits from the people have given\n’em back to the needy. You’ve put a toe on righteous earth, even if you left\nthe other foot on evil! So we’ll give you a chance. To come down on the\nside o’ the saints, as your Gurkish friends might say.”\nJudge leaned forwards and pointed with her long forefinger. “Accept\nyour guilt and denounce. Denounce both your fathers. Tell us where we can\nfind Old Sticks. Put him in the dock in your place and live. Refuse?” She\ndraped herself back into her chair, black eyes fixed on Savine like a wolf’s\non dinner. “The Tower o’ Chains is waiting.”\nNo one called out in Savine’s defence now, paid or not, and who could\nblame them? There was only accusation in the rings of tight-packed faces at\nthe balconies above. She leaned over the dock to lay Ardee in the crook of\nFreid’s arm, next to her brother. The blanket had come loose and she tucked\nit gently around her again, laid one hand upon her, the other on Harod. He\nsquirmed and snivelled. She wanted to hold him so badly, one last time. But\nthat would only put them in danger. She had to do the brave thing, for once.\nPut someone else above herself and let them go.\n“Try to keep them safe,” she whispered.\nFreid nodded dumbly, tears on her cheeks. Tears more of fear than\nsorrow, Savine rather thought, and who could blame her?\nShe adjusted her dress as she turned back to Judge. Foolishness, of\ncourse, but the habit was impossible to break. Her mother had always\nwarned her a man is judged by his best moment, a woman by her worst.\nOne had to make the effort, even for an informal event. Savine forced back\nher shoulders, raised her chin into that position of eternal slight discomfort\nher governess always used to call deportment.\n“I have no idea where my father is,” she said.\nJudge narrowed her eyes. “Come, come, Citizeness Brock. That won’t\nsave your life.”\nShort of Arch Lector Glokta throwing off a cloak and revealing himself\nin the public gallery, Savine did not see that anything could. But she refused\nto let them beat her. Dignity is not worth much, in the end, but she was\ndetermined to keep it even so.\n“You picked apt names for yourselves.” Savine looked around the ruined\nhall that was once the Lords’ Round. Its scarred marble, smashed furniture,\nempty slogans, red-daubed thugs. “You are Burners. You build nothing, you\nmake nothing. All you can do is destroy. The old regime was rotten. The"

And may I say that in my long career there’s no ruling\nI’ve enjoyed pronouncing more.” And she raised her hammer.\n“Wait!” screeched Orso, his sweaty face pressed to the bars of his cage.\nJudge turned ever so slowly to regard him through narrowed eyes. “For\nwhat, Citizen Orso?”\n“If she won’t make denouncements, I will!” A swell of whispers went\nup, in spite of Judge’s threats. “I’ll denounce anyone! I’ll denounce\neveryone! I’ll give you the best damn denouncing you ever heard!”\nJudge stared at him for a long, tense moment, while a bead of sweat\ntickled ever so slowly down his scalp.

Corporal Halder, let His Excuse for a\nFucking Majesty address the court.”\nHalder strode to the cage’s door and unlocked it as the eager babble\nspread around the hall.\n“What are you doing?” hissed Hildi as Orso stepped from captivity.\n“Buying time.” He was no mighty warrior. He was no learned sage. But\nwhen it came to talking rubbish he acknowledged no equal.\n“Representatives!” he thundered, advancing across the tiled floor where\nhe had once sentenced Lord Wetterlant to death. “Ex-lords and ladies, ex-\nsubjects of myself and my father, good Citizens and Citizenesses of the\nUnion! I, Orso the First, King of Angland, Starikland and Midderland,\nProtector of Westport and High King of the Union, lately resident in a\nfreezing cellar beneath the palace, come before you now in this sweltering\nruin to make denouncements!”\n“Do it, then,” said Judge.\n“I will, Citizeness, I will.” Orso cleared his throat, gave the court an\napologetic smile, dragged out the expectant silence. “I fear I cannot divulge\nto you the hiding place of Old Sticks. Not by any means because I refuse to\ndo so! Because I do not know. Honestly, what kind of fool would trust me\nwith important information? Would you trust me? I’m not sure I would!”\nHe shook his head as a few chuckles echoed from the galleries. “I’m not\nsure I would.” He was happy to be their clown, if it bought Savine a few\nmoments. “But I’ll happily denounce the bastard! He was Arch Lector of\nthe Inquisition, for the Fates’ sakes—he more or less denounces himself!”\nHearty shouts of agreement. “He was the rotten heart of the Closed Council"

        "text": "the Inquisition, for the Fates’ sakes—he more or less denounces himself!”\nHearty shouts of agreement. “He was the rotten heart of the Closed Council\nfor thirty years! A hoarder of power. A prolific torturer. An implacable\nenemy to noblemen and common men alike. Worst of all, he has let his\ndaughter…” He looked over at Savine, who was staring at him from the\ndock, hands gripping its rail. “His adopted daughter, pay for his crimes in\nhis absence. What a withered shit! What a crippled coward! What a two-bit\ntyrant!”\nCheers and laughter at each insult, and Orso glanced at Tunny, just in\npassing. The ex-standard-bearer had the ghost of a smile, still turning that\none finger around and around. Drag it out. Drag it out. Orso took a huge\nbreath.\n“Yes, good Citizens and Citizenesses, His Eminence Arch Lector Glokta\nwas a specimen as morally as he was physically repugnant. But he did not\nruin the Union alone! He did not bring us to the dire pass in which we now\nfind ourselves without a willing patsy to warm the throne while he worked.\nPray allow me to make an introduction to my noble father, King Jezal the\nFirst!”\nA few bits of thrown food accompanied the name and some light\nheckling which Judge was obliged to wave into silence. “Interrupt the\ndefence, people, by all means, but not the fucking denunciations!”\n“My thanks, Your Honour.” Orso bowed extravagantly, exactly the way\nhis mother had taught him. “I like to think my father had good instincts,\nburied deep. He would often discuss them, when we fenced together.\nProjects for the relief of the poor. For the fair distribution of medicine and\neducation. For peace on our borders. But that he had good instincts only\nmakes his total failure to follow them all the worse. You can pardon a man\nwho knows no better. One who ignores the best parts of himself you can\nonly condemn. What a waste of flesh he turned out to be! What a worthless\nfart! What an empty vessel!”\n“Hear, hear!” Judge hammered lazily at the table. “I find the bastard\nguilty in his absence!”\nFar from the worst injustice witnessed in the Court of the People. In\nspite of his many faults, Orso’s father had been a generous sort. He would\nnot have minded being lightly slandered in a good cause. Especially when\nthat good cause was the life of his first-born natural child.\n“Thank you, friends, for your patience,” bellowed Orso, “but my roll of\nignominy is by no means finished. You might suppose the blame would stop\nat the throne, but you could not be more wrong! There has always been a\nman behind the throne of the Union…” He let the moment stretch, the\nanticipation build. “I would like next to denounce none other than Bayaz,\nthe First of the Magi, whose statue until recently stood in the Kingsway!\nTwo statues of the bastard, in fact, such was his monstrous vanity. The top\nand tail to centuries of exploitation! He was the man who gave my father\nand Old Sticks their orders. He was the painstaking watchmaker who pieced\ntogether the corrupt system that ground every Citizen of the Union down."

He was the painstaking watchmaker who pieced\ntogether the corrupt system that ground every Citizen of the Union down.\nHe was the one who returned when it suited him, to ensure it was still\ngrinding people down as efficiently as ever. He was the one who carelessly\nlaid waste to the Agriont, who killed thousands in the name of his\nambitions, then forced the survivors to celebrate him as their saviour! The\nvery personification of ruthlessness, a puppeteer who used kings as his\nmarionettes!”\nAll eyes were fixed on him as he paraded across the grubby tiles. He\ncaught a glimpse of Savine whispering to her maid and the woman edged\naway with the children in her arms. Orso redoubled his efforts.\n“All this is common—if horrible—knowledge, but do you know how he\nprofited from it all? Profited beyond the dreams of avarice? You want\nusurers? Hoarders? Speculators? Bayaz is the grandfather of them all. A\nmagus more taken with money than magic!” Secrets did not seem so very\nimportant now, nor immortal wizards so very frightening. “He is both Valint\nand Balk! The loans that broke the state were all taken from him, the\ninterest all paid to him. He was the one who made a Great Change\ninevitable. Made it necessary, even! He is the one who should be standing\nin that dock, to receive the People’s Justice!”\n“I’ll keep a warrant warm for him,” said Judge, her black eyes gleaming,\n“but sad to say the First o’ the Magi’s beyond our reach. You done?”\n“I beg the court’s patience for just one more! The worst of the pack. The\nlowest of the low. Lastly, and most fiercely, I denounce… myself.” And he\nspread his arms wide as though inviting the crowd to shoot him full of\narrows. There was laughter. There was applause, of a mocking variety. “I\nhave been lazy. I have been vain. I have been as petty as my mother and as\nindecisive as my father. I could have done good, but I could not be\nbothered. I could have made peace, but I was too busy making love. I could\nhave made the Union a better place! If only I hadn’t been so very, very\ndrunk. I have no doubt that history will judge me to have been not only the\nlast High King of the Union, but the worst, and my brief reign the most\ndisastrous on—”\nThere was a boom as the doors at the top of the aisle were flung open\nand a Burner in red-smeared armour staggered breathless to the steps.\nJudge leaped up, raising her hammer as if she was about to fling it at\nhim. “I said we weren’t to be disturbed!”\n“But there’s royalists approaching the Agriont!” he squealed, cringing.\n“There’s what?”\n“Inside the city! Lord Marshal Forest is leading ’em!”\nThere was no stopping the noise now. Gasps of “Royalists?” Screams of\n“Treachery?” Shrieks of “Forest?”\n“Where’s the fucking Young Lion?” demanded Judge.\n“He’s with ’em!”"

And as Orso\nlooked across the staring faces on the Representatives’ benches, from\nCitizens Heugen and Isher to a surprisingly popular beggar elected from the\nThree Farms, he knew they were all working desperately at this strange new\nsum, trying to tally up where their best interests lay, and therefore what\nmixture of emotion to put on display. He suspected loyalties shifted quicker\nin that moment than at any time since his father was unexpectedly voted to\nthe throne.\nThose most loyal to the Great Change shook fists and roared their\ndismay. Several of the ex-lords did not look surprised, let alone displeased.\nMost chose, perhaps wisely, to hedge their bets and stay quiet. But up in the\npublic gallery they were more vocal.\n“The Young Lion!” someone called, in what sounded very much like\nfull-throated support.\n“The Darling o’ the Slums!” came a woman’s voice. “You saved my—”\nCut off in a squeal.\n“Freedom! Freedom!” Though for who and from what was not\nexplained.\nA kind of fever had broken out. A madness of hope, fear and fury. Like\nthe one on the day the Breakers first took the city, maybe. People scrambled\nfor the doors. Ran for safety, for their families. Others fought their way to\nthe railings of the gallery to bellow their disgust or their encouragement.\n“Death to Aristocrats!”\n“Enough bloodshed! Enough bloodshed!”\n“Down with the Great Change!”\n“Hang ’em all!”\n“Bastards!”\nThere was even a plaintive cry of, “Long live the king!” Over-earnest,\nentirely mad or simply an early bet on a new reality, it was impossible to\nsay.\n“I fucking doubt it,” snarled Judge. She pointed at Orso with a finger\nsporting at least four stolen wedding rings. “Since you’re so keen to\ndenounce yourself on her behalf, you can take the long drop with her.\nCorporal Halder, bind this fool!”\nHalder looked like he’d much rather have slipped out of a side door, but\nthe habit of obedience was hard to break. He and one of his fellows pulled\nOrso’s arms behind him and the cord painfully tight about his wrists, while\nBroad brought Savine down from the dock and bound her hands, his heavy\njaw fixed, his red eyes staring.\n“Burners, to me!” screeched Judge, and they began to converge from\nevery part of the court. From the benches, from the galleries, from their\nplaces on guard around the walls. Men and women with red-daubed clothes,\nred-spattered armour, the fire of fanaticism still hot in their eyes. Men and\nwomen who would rather go down in flames than see any hint of the old\nUnion return.\nHalder grabbed Orso under the arm and started to march him towards\nthe aisle, a good four-score Burners gathering around them in a grim knot,\nweapons drawn, with Judge their furious spear-point.\nThe door shuddered against Vick’s shoulder with a sound of splintering\nwood.\nThey’d brought an axe, then, and from the feel of it a big one.

She\nwondered how long she and Gorst could hold the door shut. She wondered\nhow many Burners were out there. She wondered what would happen when\nthey got in. She didn’t like any of her answers.\nThe axe blows stopped and there was a sudden shove on the door, harder\nthan ever, so hard it nearly flung Vick to the ground.\nShe’d wedged pieces of a broken spear into the brackets where the bar\nwould’ve gone, but they didn’t fit, jumping and flexing. She could hear\nthem outside, one voice calling the rhythm. “Shove! Shove! Shove!”\nThere was a faint squealing, and with a chill horror Vick saw one of the\nbrackets was working loose, rusted nails easing from splintering wood at\nthe pressure outside.\n“The frame’s rotten!” she hissed through her gritted teeth. The door had\neased open a chink, and then wider, the grunts and growls coming louder\nthan ever from beyond.\nGorst’s eyes met hers, and she got the feeling they’d come to the same\nconclusion: they weren’t going to be able to hold that door shut much\nlonger.\n“On three,” he hissed, keeping one shoulder braced against the wood,\nbut sliding out his short steel with the other hand, “we open it.”\n“We fucking what?” Vick snarled back at him.\n“And fight.”\nThe door jerked open another finger’s breadth. Something slid through,\nso close to Vick she had to twist her face away, staring at it cross-eyed. The\nblade of a spear. Someone was using it as a lever, working the door open.\n“One,” squeaked Gorst.\nVick gave the door a last parting shove then scrambled back, clawing\nher bloody mace up from the floor.\n“Two.”\nThe bracket dropped free of the frame and bounced away, the pieces of\nbroken spear tumbling, Gorst’s boots sliding as he was forced back.\n“Three!”\nAnd he jumped clear, sweeping out his long steel. Between the half-light\nand the panic, Vick wasn’t sure how many burst through into the chain\nroom. Too many. They were shouting. She’d no idea what, over her own\nquick breath. Just swearing, maybe. Just mindless shrieking, maybe. She\nmight’ve been shrieking herself.\nOne came tottering bent over, almost falling from the pressure behind.\nGorst’s long steel hacked into the back of his head in a spray of blood.\nAnother got the short steel through his guts and floundered about,\nscreeching, tangled up with his own halberd. Another came with a shield\nup, barrelled into Gorst and managed to shove him away from the door.\nWhich is how one could come straight at Vick, screaming at the top of\nhis voice. She caught a glimpse of him as he pounded through a shaft of\nlight, lips curled back, a smear of Burner’s red paint across his cheek.\nThen her mace crunched into his mouth, bits of tooth flying. His head\nsnapped up, his roar turned to a squawk. She tried to swing again but he\nblundered into her, so the mace missed his head and thumped weakly"

She stumbled, caught her heel on a fallen body and went\nover on her arse. With a kind of wounded bellow, the Burner she’d hit in the\nmouth flopped towards the nearest windlass, drooling blood.\n“Fuck!” Vick scrambled up, rearing over him, swinging the mace with\nboth hands. She smashed in the back of his head, but his hands were already\naround the lever. Now he sagged onto it, a dead weight.\nThere was a heavy clunk. Gears whirred as the portcullis began to drop\nin its frame, its cross-hatched shadow shifting on the wall.\nThere was a clatter as Gorst dropped his steels and caught the windlass.\nIt dragged him along for a moment, but he twisted, teeth clenched, got his\nshoulder against one handle and braced himself, trembling, growling,\nhaving to strain with all his strength to hold it up. For an instant, everything\nwas oddly still.\nThen someone stepped through the door behind him. Corporal Smiler,\nand by no means smiling. He saw Gorst, he saw all the dead Burners, plus\none still screaming, crawling, screaming as he tried to hold his guts in. He\nheaved up an outsized axe, the one he must’ve been using on the door, its\nblade near scraping the ceiling, ready to split Gorst’s skull in half.\nHe gave a surprised ooof as Vick charged into him, drove him crashing\ninto the wall, the axe bouncing off her back and onto the floor. She went at\nhim with everything she had. Tried for his balls with a clumsy jab of the\nmace but only hit his hip, dug her other fist into his stomach but barely got a\nwheeze from him. She straightened up so she could swing at his throat.\nShe caught a flash of movement in the darkness, then a sick crunch.\nShe gave a snorting gurgle. Mouth full of blood. Her face felt weird.\nSomeone was screaming. Choking, horrible screams. Was that her?\nThere’d been something important she had to do. Couldn’t think what.\nCouldn’t think at all.\nSomething about a tunnel. Ah, portcullis! She groggily shook her head.\nShe could see Gorst, still straining at the windlass, jaw squirming, but he\nlooked a long way off. Everything dim.\nThere was something tight around her neck. Tried to slap it away but her\nhands were so weak. It squeezed tighter, and tighter. Couldn’t breathe.\nSmiler had her around the throat, pressed up against the wall, her feet\nbarely touching the floor. He was snarling in her throbbing face. She tore at\nhis hands with her nails, her mouth blowing breathless, bloody squelches in\nhis face. She wriggled, struggled, but he was too strong.

Couldn’t breathe.\nHe kept holding her with one hand, made a big fist with the other,\nbringing it back to smash her face again, and she pulled the knife and lashed\nat him, overhand. Her arm was numb, tangled with his elbow on the way,\nbut the blade still caught something.\nHe let go and she flopped down on hands and knees. She could just hear\nhis wail over the sudden roaring of blood in her ears. She saw him lurch\naway, one hand clapped to the side of his head, and he tripped in the\ndarkness and went over backwards.\nFuck, she wanted to lie down. The bastard with the guts was curled up\non his side now, sobbing. She wanted to join him. Instead she struggled to\nher feet, clinging to the corner of a crate full of flatbow bolts, knees bent\nlike a sailor on the slick deck of a storm-tossed ship. She gasped for air,\nwheezing, braying, wanting to puke with each breath. Her face was one\npulsing mass of pain.\nGorst was still straining at the handles of the windlass, veins bulging\nfrom his neck, sweat beaded on his forehead, the mechanism grinding. His\neyes flickered to his steels, on the floor beside his boot, then to the other\nside of the room. Over there, in the shadows, Smiler clambered up,\ngrowling through gritted teeth. He had a great ragged wound down the side\nof his head, blood pattering his shoulder and streaking his armour, his ear\nhanging off by a shred of gristle. A wound bad enough to make him very\nangry. But not bad enough to put him down.\nVick could certainly have used Gorst’s help. But if he let go and that\nportcullis dropped, all their plans were fucked.\n“Thtay!” she snarled at him, her battered throat hardly able to get the air,\nher battered mouth hardly able to make the words. “I’ll handle thith.”\nShe caught the haft of the big axe and dragged it towards her, blade\nscraping against the stones. Bloody hell, it was a weight, thick haft riveted\nwith strips of steel, she could scarcely even lift it.\nSmiler was on his feet, facing her from the other side of the chain room,\nnear the open door, one of his dead comrades’ fallen swords in one hand,\nthe other clapped to the gash Vick had dug into the side of his head. His\nleather jerkin was splattered all over, no way of telling what was red paint,\nor his blood, or hers. His face twisted into a snarl.\n“Come here, bitch!” he roared at her.\nVick charged. Or at any rate she half-stumbled, half-fell. But not straight\nat him. Sideways at the portcullis. She dropped, which wasn’t hard to do,\nand slid the axe along the floor, ramming the haft straight through the\ngrating until the blade caught against it."

He bent\ndown, narrowed eyes fixed on Smiler. He came up with his bloody steels in\nhis fists. He worked his shoulders, then stretched his neck one way, then the\nother.\n“Come here, bitch,” he said in that piping voice.\nSmiler glanced at Vick. She stayed on her knees and gave a little shrug.\nHe tossed away the sword and bolted through the open doorway. Gorst\nstepped over one of the corpses, put his shoulder to the door and heaved it\nshut again, ended up sitting on the floor with his back to the wood. The\nBurner who’d been stuck in the guts had stopped screaming. Just lay there\non his side in a great slick of blood, each breath a shallow squeak.\n“You hurt?” asked Gorst.\nVick put her fingers gingerly to her nose. A barely recognisable sticky\nmass on the front of her throbbing face.\n“I’ve had worth,” she mumbled. Would’ve sounded more dauntless if\nshe could’ve made the “s” sound, maybe. She thought she could hear\nsomething. The blood rushing in her skull, or hooves at a distance? She\nstumbled on wobbling legs, gripping hard at her aching hip, over to the slit\nwindows facing the dry moat. She squinted into the brightness outside, face\npressed to the stone.\nShe saw the bridge. The slogan-daubed buildings beyond. The wide\nstreet that led into the city. And coming up it, at a clattering canter, a great\nmass of horsemen. Armed and armoured, bristling with steel. Leo dan\nBrock’s lion standard flew at the head, the sun of the Union beside it.\n“They’re here,” she croaked. Would’ve felt more relief if her neck hurt\nless, maybe. She tried to sniff and failed, then worked her tongue around\nher mouth and spat more blood. “So… that’s good.”\nThe scarred walls of the Agriont rushed up to meet them.\nLeo’s eyes were narrowed against the wind, his horse jolting wildly on\nthe cobbled street, riders shouting and jostling all around him, but he saw\nnow that the portcullises were still raised, their iron teeth gleaming in the\nceiling of the entrance tunnel.\nTeufel had come through. The woman made herself hard to like, but Leo\nmuch preferred competence to charm these days. The archway of white\nlight beckoned at the far end. The way into the Agriont was open.\nLeo grinned sideways at Jurand, and Jurand smiled back. By the dead,\nhe’d forgotten the feeling of riding at the enemy with good men beside him.\nPeople scattered from the gateway. Shocked faces as they dived aside."

A few dozen Burners, all daubed with red, trying to throw\nup a barricade around an upturned cart.\nLeo couldn’t have stopped even if he’d wanted to, and he didn’t. “For\nthe Union!” he roared, aching from the effort of clinging to his horse.\n“Charge!”\nHe picked his spot, hunched low as he jumped a few tangled chairs and\ncrashed down among the shrieking Burners on the other side, scattering\nbodies.\nHe had to drop his reins to free his sword. You’d think with one arm you\ncould still swing a blade well enough, but without his leg to grip his horse\nor his other arm to give him balance, he wobbled in the saddle, flailed\nuselessly, struck someone with the flat and nearly fumbled the grip. His\nown clumsiness filled him with fury and he clenched his teeth, hacking\nabout him, finally landing a decent blow on the other side, blood spattering\nyellow hair.\nHe wasn’t the man he used to be, that was plain. He was streaming with\nsweat under his armour, gasping for breath, useless arm throbbing numbly.\nRiders kept smashing into the remnants of the barricade. Jumping over\nit, blades flashing in the sunlight. Jurand had his teeth bared, swinging\naway. A couple of horses lay dying, one of Leo’s officers was on his knees,\ncoughing blood, but the Burners were shattered, already running.\nSome of Forest’s men tore after them on horseback, the lord marshal\nhimself close behind, couched over his saddle as his horse jumped the half-\nbuilt barricade. “Save the king!” he roared over his shoulder and Leo\nspurred after, clinging to sword and reins at once.\nThe park opened up before them, a muddy, overgrown mockery of the\nshimmering greenery he’d swaggered through when he first visited Adua.\nThere were running figures everywhere. Running towards him, running\naway. Almost as much chaos as the day of the Great Change.

The\nYoung Lion might not be swept away by every feeling any more, but he still\ntook his duty very seriously.\n“Forward!” he roared over his shoulder. “To the Lords’ Round!” He’d be\ndamned if anyone would call it the Court of the People ever again.\nThe Sentence\nS\navine had become something of a connoisseur of mayhem. She had been\ncaught up in the vicious uprising in Valbeck, been a prisoner in the Agriont\non the day of the Great Change, borne personal witness to the terror that\nfollowed. But the chaos in the Square of Martyrs now was not the\npurposeful kind that the Breakers, then the Burners, had chosen to impose\nupon the Union. This reminded her more of the rout after Stoffenbeck. The\noutright panic of the losing side in a battle. The vicious frenzy of every\nperson for themselves.\nQuite a crowd must have gathered for her execution, but now, with news\nof the approaching royalist army, it was their own imminent deaths that\nwere commanding all their attention. Mobs had formed around the\narchways leading off the square, people screaming and shoving and\ntrampling one another, tangled with riders and hawkers’ carts. Here is how\nthings end: not with some grand drama, but a shameful scuffle in a gate.\nOver the slaughterhouse squealing of mortal terror, Savine thought she\ncould hear the faint sounds of fighting. The same distant clamour of men\nand metal she had heard at Stoffenbeck, and it sparked that same mixture of\nhope and fear, though with an even more desperate edge now.\nJudge glowered back up the rubbish-strewn steps towards the Lords’\nRound. The Commons’ Round. The Court of the People. The heart of the\nUnion, whichever version of the Union you subscribed to, rebuilt even more\ngrandly on the grand ruins of the one Bayaz had laid waste to, its stonework\npocked and scarred and daubed with the slogans of the Great Change.\n“Burn it,” she said.\nThe way they set to the task it must have been a plan long arranged.\nBurners trotted off with torches and a few moments later Savine was\nshocked to see flames flicker up the sides of the building. Wood stacked in\nreadiness, she supposed, and buttresses painted with pitch.\nJudge took a long breath and blew it out in a sour grunt, like a woman\nlooking back on the dream home from which she has just been evicted.\n“Court stands in recess,” she muttered. “Let’s go.”\n“Let’s go,” said Broad, steering Savine by the shoulder. There was no\nviolence in it, but there was no resisting it, either.\nThe Burners pressed in close as they set off across the square. She could\nsee nothing between their bodies but running figures, the odd flash of a\nterrified face. She could not even tell where Orso was. Somewhere else in\nthis jostling, stinking, red-spattered knot of fanatics. She wished he was\nbeside her. This one last time.\nShe stumbled, would have fallen if Broad hadn’t caught her arm."

This one last time.\nShe stumbled, would have fallen if Broad hadn’t caught her arm.\nCandles sent skittering. Set up as a little shrine beside one of the names\ncarved in the flagstones. The names of those killed to keep the old regime in\npower, half-glimpsed under her shuffling feet, blurred through the wet in\nher eyes. The names of those her father had beaten, tortured, hanged so that\nshe could be rich.\nBroad had tied her hands in front of her rather than behind. They had no\nfear she would make some mad bid for freedom. She had sometimes\nwatched the arrested taken away, mute and tame, and wondered why they\ndid not fight, however long the odds. But now she let herself be herded to\nher death without even—\nThe children! A sudden pang of dread. She cast about wildly, clutching\nat her dress, straining at the cords around her wrists. Freid had them. She\nsucked in a shuddering breath. Freid would keep them safe. And if she did\nnot, what could Savine do? Not a thing.\nShe had been fixed on becoming a better person for them. Better than\nher parents had been for her. Their best friend, faithful protector, wise\nteacher, honest confidante. Now they would grow up without ever knowing\nher. Not even remembering her. Ever since she was arrested she had been\ntelling herself she was doomed. But it was only now that she really started\nto believe it.\nThere was a crash as something hit one of the Burners on the helmet.\n“This is madness,” someone was hissing, “fucking madness,” his nervous\neyes darting, clearly less of a true believer than the rest.\n“Keep moving,” came Judge’s snarl.\nThe sounds of fighting were growing louder. Closer. Leo might be just\nbeyond the edge of the square. Might be cutting his way through to her,\neven now. A surge went through the Burners and she was shouldered\nsideways, caught her shoe on something, bit her tongue as she nearly fell.\nThe outstretched arm of a limp body, bloody hair spread across the cracked\nflagstones.\n“Keep moving,” Broad growled, nudging her on.\nIt had been easy to be brave, in the Court of the People. To play the part\nof the noble martyr. Now the Tower of Chains loomed up ahead, Savine’s\nneck tilting further and further back as she stared towards its roof, and the\nfear began to grip her. The way it had in Valbeck, when she crawled through\nher own whirring machinery, when she ran through the ruined streets. Her\nmouth grew dry. Her knees grew weak. Her breath came faster and faster.\nShe was so fixed on the tower’s top she did not see Curnsbick’s lift until\nthey were almost upon it. But then it had few of the flourishes of the\ninventor’s best work. A dizzying column of rickety scaffolding, a wooden\nplatform at the bottom with a rail around the edge and chains at each corner.\nAt the sight of it she could not seem to stop her chest heaving, and yet she\ncould not seem to get a proper breath. Suddenly, stupidly, she desperately\nwanted her mother."

Suddenly, stupidly, she desperately\nwanted her mother.\n“It’s not too late to talk!” she blurted out.\n“It’s always been too late.” Judge thoughtfully raised one brow at her.\n“Do you know why they call me Judge?”\nSavine stared back dumbly.\n“Honestly? Neither do I.” She jerked her head towards the lift. “Get her\non there.”\nBroad half-ushered, half-lifted her onto the platform. She felt so weak\nshe thought she might fall as he stepped up himself, his great boot making\nthe whole thing shudder.\n“You have the king,” said Savine. “You could make a deal.”\nA few more Burners were finally showing some doubts, but not Judge.\n“That’s your thing, not mine. No one’ll be deal-making their way out o’\nthis. You lot, hold the line here! Nobody comes through, you understand?\nSarlby, Halder, let’s go.”\nThey manhandled Orso onto the lift beside her. He still had that mocking\nsmile at the corner of his mouth. The one everyone thought was contempt\nfor the world, but she knew was really contempt for himself. He was as\ncalm as a man on his way to a card game.\nHe leaned towards her as more Burners crowded onto the lift around\nthem. “Have you ever been up before?”\n“What?” she croaked. It was the first time they had spoken in months.\nSince she begged him for Leo’s life. Since she told him she was his sister.\nAnd he talked as if they were polite acquaintances running across one\nanother in the park.\n“The view’s astonishing. The perfect spot to watch the Lords’ Round\nburn. You’re going to love it.”\nShe stared at him, mouth slightly open. “Are you… joking?”\n“I rather think it might be my last opportunity.”\nShe found she’d given a disbelieving laugh. Laughed and sobbed at the\nsame time, perhaps.\nHe nudged her with his shoulder. “It’s probably not much comfort, but\nI’m glad I’m with you.”\n“So am I.” She felt stronger for it. Managed to work up the kind of arch\nglance she might have given him in Sworbreck’s office, long ago. “My\nmother always told me it’s very important who a girl is seen with.”\n“Aw,” said Judge. “This is sweet. Think I might cry, Sarlby.”\n“Think I am crying,” said Sarlby, “but maybe it’s the smoke.” There was\na tickle of it on the air now, as the flames licked ever higher up the Court of\nthe People. Or was it the Lords’ Round again, just while it burned?\nBroad did not look as if he would cry. He looked like a wooden man,\nmoved by Judge’s words like a machine by levers. Another Burner stepped\nstiffly onto the platform beside them. As if he would much rather have\nstayed but could not see how to avoid the trip. Savine realised she knew\nhim. One of the men Broad had hired, for labour relations. Bannerman, was\nit? She had seen him smiling, at the trial. He was not smiling any more."

He was not smiling any more.\nTheir eyes met, and he swallowed, the knobble in his throat bobbing.\nThe sounds of fighting were louder yet. The people trapped in the square\neven more desperate. The rest of the Burners made a crescent about the base\nof the tower, weapons pointing outwards.\nJudge jerked her thumb towards the heavens. “Take us up!” There was a\nsqueal of gears and the hoist lurched, then began to rattle upwards.\n“At least we don’t have to climb the damn steps,” said Orso, tipping his\nhead back to follow the chains straight up the well of scaffolding to the\nsquare of sky at its top. “Thanks to Master Curnsbick’s excellent lift.”\n“There’s progress,” whispered Savine.\n“Save the king!” squealed Gorst, ploughing through the panicking crowds.\nThe badly carved virtues of the Great Change squinted down on havoc,\npeople running, wailing, cringing, blundering into each other. Hard to say\nwhat side anyone was on, if there was such a thing as sides any more. Most\nwere just trying to live through it.\n“Save the king!” Gorst hacked someone down with his long steel, sent\nthem bouncing from a pedestal, smearing blood across the stained marble.\nHe kicked, shoved, screeched his way through the mob and Vick limped\nafter him, her face one enormous throb, a watchful eye on his steels in case\nhe took her head off with a backswing, wondering what her chances were of\nfinding someone out here who could set a broken nose.\nThey burst onto the Square of Martyrs and she hobbled to a stop, nearly\nslipping over backwards, her free hand up to shield her battered face. The\nCourt of the People was on fire. A giant torch, angry flames roaring. One of\nits great windows shattered, sparks showering, throwing garish light across\nthe chaos.\nSomething hit Vick on the back of the head and she stumbled. Didn’t\neven know what it was. Where it had come from. Touched fingers to her\nhair and they came away bloody. But then she was covered in blood\nalready. Her nose was blocked with it, her chin crusted with it, her mouth\nsalty with it.\n“Save the king!” Gorst pounded on, people scattering in front of him.\nHorsemen spilled from the slogan-daubed buildings on the right, clattering\nacross the square, chopping people down, indiscriminate. A horse fell right\nin front of Vick, rolled, crushed its rider. She nearly fell herself as she\nstaggered around it, barged into a woman clutching an armful of\ncandlesticks.\n“Save the king!” shrieked Gorst, pounding on towards the Tower of\nChains. Through the tears the smoke had stung from her eyes, Vick thought\nshe could see Curnsbick’s lift crawling up the scaffold on its side.\nThere were Burners there. A curved line of them, weapons ready,\nsharpened steel gleaming with the colours of fire. A last line of defence\naround their place of execution.\nHorsemen crashed into them. Anglanders maybe, in dark uniforms."

Something crunched into Vick’s side\nand sent her rolling over and over, into a fallen wagon with one wheel\nsqueaking around in the air. She squirmed onto her back, clutching at her\njacket. Just dirt. She wasn’t hurt. No worse than she’d been before, anyway.\nMace still flapping around her wrist on its thong and she caught it by the\nhandle and scrambled up.\nThe Burners’ line was coming apart. She shrank back as horsemen\nthundered past. She saw one catch a spear in the throat, tumble from the\nsaddle. She saw a man drop with his helmet dented right in. She saw Gorst,\nface locked in a snarl, savagely swinging.\nA Burner stared straight at Vick. She stepped up, caught him by the\npaint-smeared breastplate. Before she could even lift her mace, Gorst’s long\nsteel whipped past and took his head off, left Vick staring in shock at the\nsquirting stump. Her hand was tangled with his armour and she was\ndragged down on top of him, fresh blood in her eyes, in her face.\nShe twisted free, spitting and coughing. A bearded man sat, very\nsurprised, a shattered spear shaft sticking from his groin. A woman knelt\nblubbing, great strings of snot hanging from her nose. A rider with a soot-\nstreaked face stared down at his stricken mount, lying on its side, hooves\nscraping weakly at the bloody flagstones.\n“Where is she?” someone roared. “Where is she?”\n“Help! Some help here!”\n“For the king!”\n“My shoulder! Please, my shoulder!”\nVick stood staring, breathing hard through her sore mouth, still gripping\nthe mace so tight her hand ached.\nGorst held his bloody steels in clenched fists, staring up towards that\ngreat scaffold, the platform inching its way upwards. “Not again,” he\ngrowled. “Not again.”\nThe Burners were finished. Most of them dead or wounded, the rest\nthrowing down their weapons. For better or worse, it looked as if the Great\nChange was done. Or maybe there was a new Great Change, but what it\nwas a change into no one could yet say.\nBrock sat above the whole mess on his high horse amid a cluster of\ndark-uniformed Anglanders, pointing towards the Tower of Chains with his\nsword.\n“How does that bloody lift work? We have to get it down!”\nVick stared up towards the roof. The platform had stopped moving.\nThey were already at the top.\nShe licked her split lip and spat yet again, then untangled the thong from\nher wrist with clumsy fingers and tossed the mace on the ground.

Crisp and sunny, with a cool breeze carrying off the vapours so you\ncould see across the city. That same mad view he’d witnessed a hundred\ntimes, but every time it somehow took him by surprise.\nHe caught Bannerman’s eye. The man had lost all his swagger. He\nlooked scared and confused at once. Like he couldn’t see how they’d ended\nup here. Broad knew how. Some men can’t help themselves.\nHe wasn’t drunk. Hadn’t touched a drop all day. But he felt drunk. Head\nspinning. He wondered how many people he’d thrown down now. How\nmany he’d seen thrown down. Never someone he knew well, though. Never\nsomeone who’d saved his life. His family’s lives.\nHe felt the letter, crushed to a sweaty ball in his fist.\nWe hear you are in trouble.\nDidn’t think he could hear fighting any more. Just the sounds of the\nwounded now, thin on the wind. Had the Young Lion won? Was the Great\nChange done? The thought brought up no real feeling. He was playing dead,\nmaybe. He’d done that in Styria. Told himself he was dead so nothing that\nwas done to him could matter. Nothing that he did could matter.\nPeaceful up here, so high above the city. As high as the highest smoking\nchimneys. He watched Bannerman nudge Savine up the three steps to the\nplatform. He watched Orso shake off Halder’s hand and take the three steps\nhimself to stand beside her. Facing the city. Facing the sea.\nWe hear you have lost yourself.\n“Don’t worry,” said Judge, her wild red hair whipped and slashed by the\nwind, and behind her flames flickered, smoke rolling into the sky from the\nburning Court of the People. She put a hand on Broad’s cheek. “I know this\nisn’t easy. Sarlby?”\n“No,” said Broad. He tossed the letter over the parapet, watched it drop\nout of sight. “It should be me.”\nWe know who you are.\nHe stepped forward. Shouldered past Sarlby, and Bannerman, and\nHalder. Comrades from the battlefields of Styria, the barricades in Valbeck,\nthe midnight beatings of striking workers. Everything took an effort. Like\nhe was wading through a bog.\nOur husband.\nMore of the city showed as he stepped up onto the platform. The grimy\nwhite towers, the dark mill chimneys, the maze of roofs leading all the way\nto the sparkling sea. Everything smelled of burning, so strong it was hard to\nbreathe.\nOur father.\nSavine stared towards the long drop, muscles working on the side of her\nface. Slightly bent over, like she wanted to huddle to the roof. Orso stood\nwith hands tied behind him and the fixed smile of a man attending an event\nhe found insufferably dull.\nA good man.\n“Ready, Your Majesty?” Broad stepped up close, cutting the cord\nbetween his wrists with a sharp jerk of his knife, then pressing it into his\npalm."

Wasn’t braced for it. A firm shove with one hand\nwas all it took. His head snapped sideways, he dropped his sword and he\ntripped one foot with the other.\nHe gave a surprised grunt as he tumbled over, like a man who’d sat\ndown only to have his chair whisked away by some joker.\n“Wha?” said one of the other Burners. Broad punched him in the face so\nhard his helmet flew off. He reeled back, hit the parapet, caught it with one\nwild hand.\nBroad bent, grabbed his ankle and yanked it up. He screamed as he went\nover, flailing at the air.\n“No!” shrieked Judge. Half fury, half wounded disbelief.\nOrso had stabbed Halder, knife buried under his jaw, blood squirting\nover the king’s clenched fist and soaking his dirty lace cuff. Savine stood\nbeside him, framed by the blue sky, eyes huge in her pale face, a dotting of\nblood on her white dress.\nOne of the other Burners was coming at Broad with a mace. Luvonte\nwas his name. A Styrian. Strange, that he’d be a Burner. But then who’d\nhave thought Broad would ever be one, either?\nHe swung as Broad ducked and the mace caught him a glancing blow,\nbounced from the top of his head. Broad came up, caught Luvonte by the\nbreastplate, lifted him off his feet and rammed him into the roof head first.\nHe felt a jolt, a pricking in his back. Hardly any pain. Surprising, to see\na dagger sticking out of his shoulder, Sarlby’s fist around the grip.\nBroad gave a great roar, twisting around. Sarlby punched him. It\nbounced off his cheek but his knuckle caught Broad’s lenses and knocked\nthem skewed, hanging from one ear. Suddenly the world was all fog. A\nsparkly blur.\nBroad tried to catch Sarlby’s throat but he was slippery as a fish. He\nlashed blindly with both fists but Sarlby dodged. Broad tripped over\nsomething. Luvonte, groaning as he rolled onto his back, face a red smear.\nBroad shook his head, squinted, managed to catch his lenses and pull them\nback on. One was cracked. A crack in the world.\nHe saw Halder sat against the parapet, hand clutched to his throat, blood\nsquirting between his fingers, black as tar.\nThen he saw Sarlby, with Bannerman’s sword in his hand and his teeth\nbared. He swung and Broad dodged back. The blade clanged into the\nparapet and sent up a puff of stone dust. Sarlby lifted it to swing again but"

Sarlby dropped the sword and it fell twinkling, tumbling, spinning\ntowards the bloodstained moat far below. Tiny figures down there, looking\nup.\nBroad could hear Orso swearing at the top of his voice.\nHe punched again, spitting, snarling, grunting, the strange and beautiful\nview spread out beyond, snapped Sarlby’s head back so it smacked into the\nparapet, left blood on the stone. How many times had they fought side by\nside?\nHe’d been a good man, Sarlby. Better than Broad. Maybe he still was.\nBroad did his best to smash his face in even so.\nIt all happened so fast.\nSavine turned from the long drop to see that two Burners had gone off\nthe tower. A third sat staring with his throat slit. A fourth lay groaning, face\ncovered in blood. Broad had Sarlby half-pinned over the parapet, one arm\ngoing up and down like a piston as he punched him. Orso spat curses while\nhe struggled with the last.\nThey staggered to one side, wrestling over an axe, leaving Savine and\nJudge to stare at each other across the flat roof of the Tower of Chains.\nCold calculation had been the root of Savine’s many victories. But there\nare times only blind fury will do.\nShe threw herself screaming from the platform. If her hands had been\nfree she’d have flailed away with both fists. Since they were tied she\nclenched them together to make one.\nShe didn’t think of her children, or the Union, or herself. She didn’t\nthink of anything but smashing Judge’s head with her hands.\n“Die, you mad cunt!” she snarled, and clubbed Judge right across the\nface, sending her stumbling towards the lift. Savine caught her around the\nrashy throat, rammed her back into the railing and started choking her,\nmaking the platform jerk and wobble, chains thrashing, the whole scaffold\ntrembling.\nJudge bared bloody teeth, almost a smile, shot out a hand. Nails sank\ninto Savine’s neck, ripping at her. She gave a shriek, cut off in a gulp as\nJudge kneed her in the gut, shoved her staggering off the lift and back\nacross the tower’s roof.\nSomeone careered into her and knocked her flying. Orso, still reeling\naround in his ungainly dance with one of the Burners. Savine’s head hit\nstone, ears ringing. Her hands were in a pool of blood. She wasn’t sure\nwhose.\n“You fucking die!” growled Judge. A foot thudded into Savine’s ribs and\nrolled her over, the back of her skull cracking on the steps up to the\nplatform.

Sarlby\nlifted an axe, ready to chop into the back of Broad’s skull. Savine grabbed it\nbelow the head and ripped it from his fist.\nShe spun about, axe held clumsily in her tied hands, just as Judge\nrammed her into the parapet with a shoulder, driving her breath out in an\nagonised rasp. They wrestled, tangled, clawed, elbowed. Savine got the axe\nin the way, snarling as she pressed it into the side of Judge’s face, but there\nwasn’t enough force behind it to stop her, only to slowly peel a flap of flesh\nfrom her cheek.\nJudge punched Savine in the stomach. And again. And again. Punched\nthe breath out of her. Punched the strength out of her. Puke scalded the back\nof her throat. The axe wrenched from her tied hands, tumbled past her\nshoulder and was gone off the tower. Savine struggled, twisted, snapped\nwith her teeth but Judge had her, bending her back over the parapet. Blood\nran from the ragged wound on her cheek in crooked streaks, dripped from\nher chin, pit-pattered in Savine’s face.\n“You’re tougher’n you look,” she said, showing a red smile. And she\ncaught Savine around the throat, pushing, pushing. “But you’re still taking\nthe long drop.”\nIt was true. Savine was slipping. Her toes were off the roof, the parapet\ngrinding into the small of her back. She could feel herself teetering, her\nbalance almost shifted over the void.\nShe heaved in one last breath and kneed Judge between the legs,\nloosened her grip just enough to catch her around the back of the neck with\nboth hands, so the cord between her wrists cut into Judge’s rash-splattered\nthroat. “So are you.”\nAnd she went over backwards.\nTime slowed to a crawl.\nA blur of clouds and sky.

Just a glimpse of her bloody snarl before she was\ngone in a mass of clawing limbs and flapping cloth.\nThen Savine crashed into something, hard.\nBut not the ground. Cut stones.\nThe side of the tower.\nShe heard Broad growling with effort.\nEverything white.

He actually might have. A sentimental streak or\ntwo.\nThere were lots of soldiers at the bottom. Lots of Anglanders in dark\nuniforms. There were Burners, too, but on their knees, or having their wrists\nbound, or lying still, daubed with red, and not just paint. Figures of terror\nno more.\n“Some help here!” he called out.\nBroad was propped against the rail, breathing hard through gritted teeth,\nhis sleeve soaked with blood and the knife still stuck deep in his shoulder.\nOrso had not dared to try to pull it out.

Everything’s taken care\nof.”\nTeufel’s weary eyes rolled towards the giant torch that had once been the\nLords’ Round, smoke pouring up from it more thickly than from all the\ncity’s chimneys combined. “You sure?”\n“We’ve got men trying to contain the blaze,” said Forest. “Say what you\nlike about the Burners, they knew how to set a fire.”\nThe consequences of recent events were only now starting to dawn on\nOrso. “So… am I king again?”\nHildi watched the last Burners being dragged away. “Looks like it,” she\nsaid.\n“Whoever would have thought?” When Orso denounced himself, he had\nmeant every word of it.

He gazed across the corpse-strewn Square\nof Marshals. More and more people were gathering, staring, blinking in\nsurprise. As if they were emerging into the sunlight after a long time in the\ndark. Veterans of his Crown Prince’s Division, in worn-out uniforms. Men\nof Angland, in sombre black. Ex-lords of the Open Council, armed with\nflatbows.\n“Things will be different this time, Hildi,” he said. “I promise.”\n“You’ve never been much at keeping those.”\n“But things will be different this time!” He did not say it only to her. He\npromised it to himself. He shouted it to everyone in that triumphant\ngathering at the foot of the Tower of Chains. “We have a chance now! For a\nfresh start. For a new Union.” One of Forest’s men was holding an old\nbattle flag, and Orso felt a surge of pride as the breeze took it and the\nblazing sun gleamed in the Agriont once again. “A chance… to do things\nright.”\nHe looked across those eager faces. Some of them were even starting to\nsmile. “No more riots,” he called, “no more trials, no more executions. No\nvengeance and no settling of scores. No Court of the People!” He caught\nSavine’s eye, her chin up, her eyes shining. If she believed in him, he knew\nit could be done. “But there can be no more Closed Council, either. No\ncorruption and injustice. No dead grip of Valint and Balk around the throat\nof the nation. This time… I mean to govern for the many, not\nthe few. To be a king for everyone.”\n“You really think you can do all that?” asked Vick, and it seemed,"

To be a king for everyone.”\n“You really think you can do all that?” asked Vick, and it seemed,\nbehind her customary mask of scorn, she couldn’t entirely hide a glimpse of\nhope.\nAt that moment, Orso felt as if he could do anything. “I can try. We can\ntry. Together. I owe you all my thanks. You especially, Vick.” He seized her\nscabbed hand and pressed it to his lips. “You gambled everything. You\ndidn’t have to.”\n“Seems I’ve a sentimental streak of loyalty,” she grunted, licking her\nbloody top lip and awkwardly working her hand free.\n“I am heartily glad of it.” He clapped Corporal Tunny on the shoulder,\ndragged Forest into a crushing hug. “Where would I have been without\nyou?”\n“Just doing my duty,” growled Forest, his cheeks colouring above his\novergrown beard.\nOrso turned to the Young Lion—pale, gaunt and ungainly on his false\nleg, blond hair darkened with sweat and that sickly smile still on his face.\nFor various reasons, several of them good ones, Orso had grown to dislike\nthe ex-Lord Governor of Angland quite intensely. But his father once said\nyou can measure a man by how he treats those he dislikes. He had said he\nwould be a king for everyone, and he meant it. The lowest as well as the\nhighest, his enemies as well as his friends. And Brock had come through for\nhim today. There was no denying that.\n“I owe you, too, Lord Brock,” said Orso, since it seemed they were all\ngoing back to their old titles. “We have had our differences. We could\nhardly have had bigger ones. But if men like us can march into the future\ntogether, there is hope for anyone.” He offered his hand. “There is hope for\neveryone.”\nBrock winced down at Orso’s open palm, taking a deep breath. As if\ncomposing himself for some distasteful task. “Not everyone,” he said, then\nproduced a dagger from behind his back and stabbed Forest in the chest.\nAt the same moment Orso felt himself gripped from behind, a blade\npressed into his throat.\nBrock’s man Jurand. “Still!” he hissed in Orso’s ear. “Everybody still!”\nSuddenly, there were raised flatbows everywhere, the points of the\nloaded bolts gleaming. Lord Isher had one, and several of his friends who\nhad once sat on the Open Council, and some of the Anglanders, too. Forest\ntook a wobbling step and dropped to his knees, blood spreading through his\njacket in a dark circle.\n“What are you doing?” Savine nearly shrieked, staring at the drawn\nswords and levelled spears.\n“I am putting an end to the Great Change,” said her husband, “and\ntaking back the Agriont in the name of the king.” Anglanders were already\ndisarming the stunned members of the King’s Own, forcing them onto their\nknees along with the Burners.\n“You fucking bathtard,” breathed Vick, but with an air of wounded\nresignation.

He\nshould have known, the moment things started looking up, that something\nlike this would happen.\n“Actually, my wife’s the bastard,” said Brock. “Which makes my son\nHarod the oldest child of King Jezal’s oldest child. A strong claim to the\nthrone.”\n“That’s not how succession works,” snarled Tunny as he was shoved\nonto his knees.\n“Are you sure?” asked Brock. “I have three-score flatbows with a\ndifferent opinion.”\nGorst still had his steels in his hands, bloody metal glinting, eyes\nnarrowed. Now he shifted his weight a fraction.\n“No!” shouted Orso, Jurand’s knife pressing hard into his neck. Best\nswordsman in the world or not, he would be dead before he could reach\nBrock, and the rest of them soon after. “Lay down your weapons. That’s a\nroyal decree!” His first in some time and, by the look of things, his last.\nGorst breathed in hard, then gave a bull’s snort and tossed his steels\nclattering down. Two Anglanders stepped forward to bind his wrists. They\nwere already doing the same to Teufel, to Hildi, to anyone who might still\nhave been loyal.\n“What have you done?” whispered Savine, back of one hand to her\nmouth. “Let them go, Leo, please, let them go!”\n“You have been through quite the ordeal,” droned Brock. “Someone take\nmy wife to our children. They need their mother.”\nThe blood was spreading out around Forest’s body. “He was a good\nman,” whispered Orso numbly. “A loyal man.”\n“Too loyal.” Brock snapped his fingers. “Secure the gates of the\nAgriont.”\n“Already done,” said Isher, smartly. A coward on the battlefield but as\nproficient a traitor as ever.\n“There’ll be a price for this!” said Orso as his wrists were tied for the\nthird time that day. He felt the need to register some resistance, however\npointless.\nBrock regarded him without the slightest trace of guilt or shame. “I’ve\nalready paid. See all members of the King’s Own taken prisoner until we\ncan make sure of each man’s obedience. Conduct Citizen Orso and his\nservants to locked quarters in the House of Questions. Glaward should\nalready have every gate and bridge in the city under guard. I want\nproclamations printed and pasted at every corner. The Great Change is\nover.”\nIsher grinned as he lowered his flatbow. “Long live King Harod the\nSecond,” he said.\nForging the Future\n“R\night, then,” said Rikke, arranging herself in Skarling’s Chair in a\nmanner that aimed for carefree and commanding at once and probably\nmissed both by an equal margin. “Time to hand out the rewards.”\nIsern’s jaw worked as she chewed. “And the punishments.”\n“Aye.” Rikke tweaked that fine fur about her shoulders and wriggled her\nback as straight as she could. “Those, too.” Shivers gave the guards a nod,\nand there was a mighty creaking as the doors of Skarling’s Hall were swung"

Hardbread swaggered at their\nhead like a man a third of his age. The Nail, who really was a third of his\nage, loped along beside him with that round-shouldered hunch, hand slack\non the battered pommel of his sword, a few new scabs and scuffs on him\nfrom the battle, but none the worse for that. None the worse at all.\n“Well, didn’t you boys do me proud?” called Rikke. “I’d offer you gifts\nbut I reckon the dead already did.”\n“A bauble or two!” And Hardbread whirled a golden chain around on his\npointed finger to widespread cheers.\n“Hardbread,” said Rikke, “you stood by my father through good times\nand bad. Now you’ve done the same for me. I’m naming you my Second.”\nHis grey brows shot up. “Y’are?”\n“Aye, and I’ll need you to start by keeping my chair warm a while.”\nThose brows rose even higher. “What, Skarling’s Chair?”\n“He may not have been a hero in quite your league, but I daresay you\ncan lower yourself to his level for a week or two.”\n“And I can think o’ few men indeed,” said Isern, “more practised than\nyou at sitting down.”\nHardbread eyed the chair as if he had some doubts. “Where will you\nbe?”\n“I’ve a little trip to take before I can sit here secure.” Rikke found she\nwas fussing with the emeralds around her neck and let them drop. “I hear\ntell my old friends the Young Lion and his wife—”\n“Fanciest bitch I ever saw,” threw in Isern.\n“—have seized power in the Union.”\n“Quite the power seizers, them twain. However you push ’em down they\nkeep floating back to the top, d’you see, like a pair o’ goat turds in the\nwell.”\nShivers was turning that ring with the red stone around and around his\nlittle finger. “I hear little Leo’s taken a turn towards the vengeful.”\n“Something wounded warriors are prone to do,” said the Nail, looking\nthoughtfully towards the corner where Stour’s cage used to hang.\n“And most warriors end up wounded, one way or another,” lamented\nHardbread, rubbing at his lip. “Why, I still remember the day Whirrun o’\nBligh caught me in the mouth with—”\n“I need to go down to Adua,” said Rikke. “See if I can patch up the\ncracks in our friendship.”\nThe Nail gave a snort. “Cracks? You stabbed ’em in the back. More’n\nonce.”\n“Patch up the knife holes, then, before Leo gets it in his head to put a\nfew in us. The North never does well out of wars with the Union. What we\nneed is peace, and smiles, and trade—”\n“And jokes,” said Shivers, stony-faced. “I’ve always liked a laugh.”"

He gave his backside a thoughtful\nsqueeze. “My arse is a fair bit broader’n yours, I reckon.”\n“So the seat’ll be toasty upon my return,” said Rikke, to some laughter\nfrom the room. “And now the Nail. Wasn’t long ago you were an enemy to\nbe feared. I’d thank Stour Nightfall for being fool enough to turn you into a\nfriend, but thanks are wasted on the dead. The West Valleys are yours\nalready. I’d like to add two more to your land on the eastern side.”\n“You’re generous as well as beautiful,” said the Nail, with the hint of a\ngrin.\n“I’ll live with one of two. But I need something from you in return.”\n“Name it.”\n“I have heard tell you like a fight.”\nHe grinned wider. “I can stand a scuffle in the right cause.”\n“Seems folk in Ollensand have come over sour about me taking charge.\nThey’ve shut up their gates. Say they’re doing things their own way from\nnow on.”\n“Can’t have that,” whispered Shivers.\n“You let one sheep pick its own path,” said Isern, “and ’fore you know it\nthe whole herd’s got opinions.”\nThe Nail slowly nodded. “I’ll make ’em aware o’ their error.”\n“Gently, eh? No need to whistle up the dogs to begin with. I’d rather\nthey came willing.”\n“And if they won’t?”\n“Bring ’em unwilling.”\n“Right y’are.” The Nail loitered a moment, like he had something more\nto say. She could guess what was on his mind. What happened between the\ntwo of them before he went away. It was on her mind, too. She’d have liked\nto say stay. Even if it was just for a night. Even if it was just for a quick\nfumble behind the kitchen. But a leader has to be careful who she lets in.\nWho she’s seen to let in. Specially a she.\nThe Nail scratched at his pale beard, looking at her sidelong, mouth\nopen like he was about to speak. When he paused, Rikke didn’t help him.\nShe couldn’t afford to.\n“Right y’are,” he said again and strode out, waving his men after. No\nsooner had they quit the place than Isern’s brothers were strolling in, a pack\nof tattooed hillmen and hillwomen at their backs.\n“Scofen and Scenn-i-Phail!” called Rikke. “Were two fat bastards ever\nmore beloved of the moon than you twain?”\n“My father always said a man should have some meat upon him,” said\nScofen, laying a great hand on his great belly.\n“His worth is his girth,” said Scenn, combing his fingers through his riot\nof red beard.\n“There’s been bad blood between the clans of the North and the people"

        "text": "“His worth is his girth,” said Scenn, combing his fingers through his riot\nof red beard.\n“There’s been bad blood between the clans of the North and the people\nof the hills for far too long,” said Rikke. “Since the time of Crummock-i-\nPhail and Bethod and since times long before. But that’s all washed away.\nYou were there when I needed you, and I’ll be there if you need me, that’s\nmy promise. But since promises are cheap, you can take the land we\ndiscussed as well.”\n“Truth is, you’ve already done us a service beyond reckoning by taking\nour sister off our hands,” said Scenn.\n“Every moment her tongue is stabbing at you is a moment it’s not\nstabbing at us,” said Scofen.\nIsern blew some chagga spit which spattered on Scofen’s shirt and made\nhim grin. “Mind you don’t get stabbed with something sharper,” she said.\n“I think of her as a sister myself,” said Rikke. “An older, tougher, wiser\nsister, at that. Reckon that makes you my brothers. And family should keep\nin touch.” Rikke sat forward. “I say we open up the ways into the hills.\nBuild better roads and set to trading more than wounds. I’ve fond memories\nof that ale I sampled last time I was with you. Coal in the hills, too, I hear,\nand copper. No doubt we’ve got things of iron and steel and cloth you might\nfind useful.”\n“No doubt,” said Scenn, reaching out to rub thoughtfully at the sleeve of\nHardbread’s mail coat between big finger and thumb.\n“A couple of you should take the voyage to Adua with me. See the\nworld. Sample the pleasures of civilisation. Take some ideas with you and\nbring a few back. Show folk down there the North’s united. Together we’ll\nmake worse enemies, and better friends, and it’ll be a thing we can all profit\nfrom.”\n“Ah, enemies and profits.” Scofen’s eyes lit up. “Things our father loved\nalmost as much as the moon.” And there was laughter, and back-slapping,\nand trading of well-meaning insults and overblown tales of the battle.\nBut being a leader can’t all be grinning at friends. Sooner or later you’ll\nhave to frown on your foes. Calder’s man Flatstone was marched in next,\nbattered and bandaged. His hands were bound, but he stood as if he meant\nto die with his pride intact, which was a thing Rikke supposed she could\nadmire.\nLurking at his shoulder, Shivers pulled out that bright little knife. Might\nbe he didn’t catch the light on the blade on purpose and flash it in\nFlatstone’s face. But Rikke wouldn’t have bet on it.\n“You’re Brodd Flatstone,” she said.\n“I am.”\n“One of Black Calder’s War Chiefs.”\n“I was.”\n“How many of my folk did you kill in the battle?”\nFlatstone gave Shivers’ blade a glance, then set his jaw and lifted his\nchin. “Many as I could.”\n“Huh. How long did you serve Black Calder?”\n“More’n twenty years. Since I won my name at the battle on the Heroes."

A lot o’ folk were doing it.” Flatstone took a breath\nthrough his broad nose, and let it puff away. “And I’d do the same again. He\nwas a great leader, in his time.”\n“But his time’s done.”\n“No arguing with that.” Flatstone lowered his head. “His time’s done,\nand yours has come, and that’s the way of things.”\n“The question on my mind is—could you be as loyal to me as you were\nto him?”\nHe looked up sharply and blinked about the room. Then he squared his\nshoulders. “I believe I could.”\n“A big man like you could kneel to a little woman like me?”\n“I’d say you were over middle height,” muttered Isern.\n“Aye, but that spoils the balance o’ the phrase.”\n“No shame kneeling to a woman who’s proved herself the way you\nhave,” said Flatstone.\nRikke raised her brows. “So…?”\n“Oh. Right.” And with a pained grunt, hands still bound behind him,\nFlatstone wobbled down to one knee.\n“My father always said, why waste what can be used? Reckon that goes\nfor men as much as aught else. More, since so much effort goes into making\nthe bastards.” Some mutters of agreement from the warriors about the hall.\nThey didn’t mind mercy for a fighter who’d fought his hardest. They knew\nthey might end up kneeling where he was one day, if luck tipped the wrong\nway. “I want you to gather any of your Carls who lived through the battle\nand are willing to serve me and take the bones o’ these Crinna fucks back\nthe way they came. While you’re out there, teach any that’ve wandered\nacross the water since a hard lesson. You understand?”\nFlatstone nodded. “I do.”\n“I do…?”\n“I do, Chief.”\nShivers cut the rope on Flatstone’s wrists and, as he stood, handed him\nback the axe he’d given up on the day of the battle, bright gold swirling on\nthe blade. He looked up at Rikke as he took it. “I appreciate the chance.\nWon’t let you down.”\n“Oh, I know.” Rikke turned her Long Eye towards him. “I’ve seen it.”\nHe swallowed and strode for the door.\n“Soft,” grunted Isern, sourly.\n“It’s worth giving your enemies a chance. They know they can’t expect\none and might be thankful for it.” Rikke frowned sideways. “Friends are\nmuch harder to please.”\nAnd indeed, Isern’s scowl got deeper than ever as the next pair were\ndragged in. Corleth and her granny, dirty from the cells and with their hands\nbound tight.\n“Easy,” said Rikke. “We won, remember? We can afford to be\ngenerous.”\n“Just ’cause you can afford it,” grunted Isern as the young woman and\nthe old were shoved down before the dais and left squinting in the sunlight,\n“doesn’t mean you should buy it.

As much\nfight in her as when she first came to Uffrith.\n“Got anything to say for yourself?” asked Rikke.\n“I could kneel here and spew excuses but you all know me for a liar.\nWhere’d be the point?”\n“We done what was asked of us,” croaked out the old woman.\n“Shame you didn’t do it better,” sneered Isern, “you might not be\nkneeling there.”\nRikke held up a hand for silence. “I reckon a lot of folk would like to see\nyou cut with the bloody cross as traitors and spies.”\nShe let the silence stretch, heavy with the weight of lives in the balance.\n“But I’m minded to be merciful. We wouldn’t have hooked Black Calder\nwithout you offering the bait, after all. You wandered into Uffrith so\nyou could tell him what we were about. Now you can wander down to\nOstenhorm. Tell me what the Union are up to.”\nThis helping of mercy wasn’t at all to the menfolk’s taste. They could\nsee past a man trying to kill ’em, but a woman tricking ’em was too much to\nstand.\n“Thought you wanted peace with the Union?” grunted Hardbread. “And\ntrade, and smiles.”\n“I’ll smile easier knowing what they’re up to,” said Rikke.\n“I don’t know no one down there,” said Corleth.\n“Good a liar as you are, I’m sure you’ll soon make new friends.”\n“What about my granny?”\n“She really your granny?”\n“She is.”\n“I’m half-tempted to keep her here so she can make me soup.” Rikke sat\nback, considering. “But it seems a shame to split up a winning act. Cut ’em\nfree, Shivers.” And he did, showing no sign of whether he thought it a good\nidea or a bad.\n“Thank you, Black Rikke,” said Corleth’s granny, near kissing the floor.\n“You won’t regret this.”\n“True.” And Rikke tapped her cheek. “I’ve seen that, too.”\n“Soft,” hissed Isern, shaking her head, and she wasn’t alone in her\nopinion. Lots of grumbling. Some outright scowls. One man spat at\nCorleth’s feet as she walked out. It was a wearying business. Proving\nyourself once as a leader is never enough. You have to do it fresh with every\nchoice.\nA miserable crowd came next, kicked and bundled into Skarling’s Hall,\nforced down on the pitiless stones before her, chains rattling. Stand-\ni’-the-Barrows’ men. Stripped of their armour of bones and with their\npaint all smeared off, they looked a lot less fearsome. One was trembling.\nOne might’ve been weeping. Don’t matter how savage a face you show the\nworld, few men dare look the Great Leveller in the eye once he comes\ncalling.

Maybe that’ll teach their kind to stay on their side of the water.”\nShe watched ’em dragged out, gibbering and weeping, and had a sense\nthe faces of the warriors in the hall were changed. No scornful glances now.\nEyes mostly to the floor, indeed. Her father would’ve said it’s a good thing,\nto show mercy.

The day wore on and the\nstrips of sunlight from the tall windows crept across the stone floor, from\none side of Skarling’s Hall to the other, till the room was mostly empty, and\nthe flood became a trickle, and the trickle dried up to naught.\n“That everyone?” asked Rikke, sitting back.\n“Just one more,” said Shivers.\nA Half-Baked Loaf\nC\nlover sat in the yard outside Skarling’s Hall and watched the nervous\nfolk called in to receive their deservings. He watched some strut out\nbeaming over their rewards. He watched some dragged out crestfallen over\ntheir punishments.

The leaders, the chiefs, the kings.\nHe’d taken a hand in a few of those ups and downs himself, indeed. Bethod,\nand the Bloody-Nine, and Black Dow, and Scale Ironhand, and Stour\nNightfall, an ever-lengthening list o’ glory and disaster.

He glanced over at Sholla and Flick. Hoped they wouldn’t end up\nstranded, on account of tethering their fortunes to his.\nMaybe, having spent half his life too reckless, he’d ended up playing it\ntoo safe. He’d clung to those who’d risen and could only come down, rather\nthan had the courage to seek out those whose tide was surging in. To seek\nout those he actually liked, maybe. But he was still casting a shadow, at\nleast. More’n you could say for Wonderful, or Magweer, or Downside, or\nall those others he’d put in the mud down the years.

No more feeling showed in his\nliving eye than his dead one. No sign of what the judgement would be. But\nfrom those coming and going, Black Rikke was proving a tougher judge\nthan folk had guessed. Girl had iron in her, that was plain, and sharpened,\ntoo.\n“Can I bring my people?” asked Clover.\nShivers looked at Flick and Sholla. “Why not?” And he stood aside to\noffer them all the way. So he’d be at their backs, o’ course. A bad man to\nhave behind you with a sword, Caul Shivers. Just ask Black Dow. But if\nClover wasn’t used to having bad men with swords about, he never would\nbe.\nRikke sat in Skarling’s Chair, an old sheepskin draped over the back and\nonto the seat, red cloak around her shoulders and green stones around her\nneck, the tattoos black on her pale face. She looked comfortable, in that\nuncomfortable-looking chair, one leg crossed over the other with the worn\nboot gently swinging. There were some big names in the room, but\neveryone faced a bit towards her, like flowers turning their petals towards\nthe sun. No doubt who had the say in that room.\n“Jonas Clover,” she said, tapping a thoughtful fingernail against the arm\nof Skarling’s Chair as he traipsed up nervously to stand before her. “Here’s\na riddle.”\n“Well.” He gave an apologetic little grin. “No one wants to be thought of\nas simple.”"

        "text": "a riddle.”\n“Well.” He gave an apologetic little grin. “No one wants to be thought of\nas simple.”\n“There are folk who’ve done me favours and folk who’ve done me\nwrongs.” She sat forwards, those troubling eyes full upon him as if she\ncould see into his head, see into his heart. “But there’s none I can think of\nthat are such a half-baked loaf as you.”\nClover scratched at the back of his head. “I’ll admit I’ve been called\nworse and deserved it.”\n“You were one of Calder’s men. One of Nightfall’s. One of those that\ninvaded the Protectorate all those months ago.”\n“I mostly ambled along at the back, to be fair.” He squinted up towards\nthe shadowy rafters, a cobweb fluttering in the breeze through the windows.\n“In that war, if I recall, I killed more men on my side than on yours.”\n“That’s naught to be proud of,” grunted Hardbread.\n“No.” Clover gave a sorry shrug. “You’ll find few men less proud o’\nthemselves than me.”\n“And once I had Skarling’s Chair,” said Rikke, “you gave every sign of\ngoing back over to Calder’s side soon as the chance was offered.”\n“When you let Stour live, then tossed all your friends away, I started\nworrying you might not have the bones for the task. In my defence, you did\nact the part o’ someone shitting themselves very nicely.”\n“Plenty o’ practice,” grunted Rikke. “And after all, I could only spare\nStour ’cause you handed him to me in the first place.”\n“That was less a service to you, though, and more about settling a score\nbetween me and him.”\nRikke looked at him baffled. “When I count something against you, you\nwant to disagree. When I count something for you, you want to disagree\nwith that, too.”\n“In my experience… things are rarely all one way or the other.”\n“You’re right there,” said Rikke, sitting back. “And you did let me go,\nthat day in the woods.”\n“That’s one good deed I’ll fully confess to,” admitted Clover.\n“A man who does good, you can predict. A man who does bad, the same.\nBut what do you do with a man who can’t make up his mind?”\n“I’ve often wondered.”\n“I like you. But I can’t have you around. Shivers?”\nClover shut his eyes then, expecting the sword in the back of his head.\nLike Black Dow. Like Black Calder. But when he gathered the courage to\nsquint around, he saw Shivers was offering him a bag. He took it and\nlooked inside. The gleam of silver, and a decent amount, by all appearances.\n“That’s… more’n generous,” he said. “If I was you I wouldn’t have me\naround, either. Hell, I’m me, and I often tire of my company.” He put his\nhand on Sholla’s shoulder and drew her forwards. “But if you’ll entertain\nme with a brief hearing, I’d like to recommend this article. Her name’s\nSholla, and I’ve never yet had cause to doubt her loyalty. A fine hand with\nan arrow, the softest footstep I never heard and an undisputed master at the"

A fine hand with\nan arrow, the softest footstep I never heard and an undisputed master at the\nnoble art of cheese-shaving. She can get ’em like a sheet of paper. I swear\nyou can see through the bastards.”\nRikke raised the brow over her blind eye at Sholla. “If I’ve one regret\nit’s that my cheese never quite carves thin enough.”\n“And then there’s this, which is called Flick. I have yet to discover any\ntalents but I’ve no doubt there’s one lurking beneath the unpromising\nexterior, and even if there ain’t he has a pleasant manner, which is too rare a\nthing in the North, I think you’ll agree.”\nRikke glanced about her closest. Caul Shivers. Isern-i-Phail. She puffed\nout her cheeks. “Well, I won’t disagree.”\n“Good. Good.” Clover gave Flick’s shoulder a parting squeeze, then let\nhis hand fall. He gave the room a smile. “Watch yourself, in Adua. I hear\nfolk down there can’t all be trusted the way they can up here.”\nRikke gave a snort. “Fine advice.”\n“And if anyone should want to learn sword-work, I am available.” And\nwith a gesture caught on awkward ground between a nod and a bow, Clover\ntook his leave.\n“Don’t we get a say?” muttered Sholla, following him out with Flick.\nThe sun was getting low now, and the yard was half in bright light, half in\ndeep shadow. Rarely all one way or the other, like he’d told Rikke.\n“I’m sparing you the pain of it,” said Clover. “You’re both better off\nhere, and I know it, and you know it, and once you thought about it you’d\nsee you had to tell me so, and it’d be an awkward scene all around. Afford\nme the dignity o’ this one last call as chief on your behalf.” He gathered ’em\nin an awkward hug. Mostly so he didn’t have to listen to ’em argue with\nhim. “Thanks for your support through hard times. And thanks especially\nfor that arrow in Downside’s shoulder.”\n“Aye, well,” said Sholla, and Clover flattered himself that she might be\nstruggling to hold back a tear or two. “Didn’t want to give the bastard the\nsatisfaction o’ killing you.”\n“You’re joking! I had that bloody half-head just where I wanted him.\nWaiting for my moment was all.”\n“What’ll you do?” asked Flick, who wasn’t trying to stop himself crying\nat all and had dirty tear tracks all over his cheeks.\nClover grinned. “Something usually comes up.” And he turned and\nstarted walking, sword over his shoulder.\nSunrise\n“Y\nou don’t like the palace,” said Leo.\nSavine didn’t seem to like anything lately, and her husband least of all.\n“I find it hard to sleep here,” she said, with a sullen glance at one of the\nAnglanders who were guarding every landing and doorway.\nHe wanted to say she was lucky to be alive but was trying hard to be\nsympathetic.

He could afford to be. “After what you’ve\nbeen through it’s a wonder you can sleep at all.”\n“The place is a ruin,” said Savine, sweeping past a mural of some grand\ncoronation with all the faces chiselled out. “It still smells.” She watched a\nman in blazing-sun livery teetering on a stepladder so he could scrub at\nslogans up near the ceiling. “There is evidence of the Burners’ tenancy\neverywhere. Of… Judge’s tenancy.” She gave an ugly shiver of disgust and\nheld baby Ardee closer. “It feels like a prison.”\nLeo clenched his jaw. How grateful most people would’ve been to be\nkept in a cage like this one. “The children are safest here, in the Agriont.”\nHe winced as he shifted Harod’s weight in the crook of his arm. “We’re\nalready patching up the walls. A king belongs in a palace, and Harod will be\nking now.”\n“Harod is a baby.”\n“That’s why he’ll need guidance.”\nSavine looked sideways at him, and hardly with the proper affection a\nwife should have for her husband. “From you, I suppose?”\n“From both of us.” But it was only right that a father should have the\nfinal word when it came to his son. By the dead, his stump was throbbing,\nhis bad arm tingling, his shoulder aching from the effort of holding the child\nas he lurched along. “We’re together in this.”\n“Are we? When we discussed bringing back the monarchy we never\nmentioned changing the monarch.”\n“Plans have to bend with circumstance,” grunted Leo. The sort of thing\nhe’d always hated hearing his mother tell him. “I would’ve warned you if I\ncould. Of course I would. But how could I? I was scrambling to save your\nlife. To save the bloody Union!”\nHe had to stop. He’d wanted to sweep into the Hall of Mirrors carrying\nhis son. To be seen as a father, head of the ideal family. The shining\nexample to be copied across the reborn nation. But dropping the tiny king\non his head then tripping over him would have won him few admirers. To\nbe a cripple well, you have to accept what you can’t do.\n“Jurand?” he forced through gritted teeth. “Could you help?” And he\ndumped the future monarch into his arms and turned away, leaving him\nblinking with elbows everywhere. No doubt he was handsome and clever\nand loyal as they come, but he made a poor nursemaid.\nStill, the only alternative was Zuri, and Leo trusted her less than ever\nthese days. Even though Savine loved her so much. Because Savine loved\nher so much, maybe. It was a bad message to send, having brown faces\naround the royal children.\nSavine frowned towards the tall windows as she walked, rocking Ardee\ngently, criss-cross shadows of the lead between the panes sliding across her\nface.

Nothing in Savine’s appearance ever happened by accident,\nafter all.\nServants were busy in the unkempt gardens outside, clipping suns of the\nUnion back into the bushes, weeding it back into the flower beds, chiselling\nit back into the scarred stonework. They must’ve ripped off those royal\nliveries when the Great Change made them fatal. Now they rushed to\nwriggle back into them. People adjust. They adjust more quickly and more\ncompletely than you’d ever imagine.\nLeo winced as he hurried to catch up. “What can I do?” he asked. “To\nmake things easier?”\n“I want no more executions.”\nAn uncomfortable pause. Jurand gave Leo one of those oh-so-expressive\nglances from under his brows. Leo took his meaning at once, as always, and\nagreed at once, as always—there would need to be at least one more. King\nOrso was a problem with only one solution.\n“I understand your feelings,” he murmured. As if fucking feelings\nshould set policy. “I understand, but—”\n“No more, Leo.”\n“Savine, the guilty have to be punished. Quietly, privately, yes, but…\nwe have to be made safe.”\n“We have to be better than Judge. Otherwise what is the point?”\n“The point is that we win.” That was so obvious he was amazed he had\nto explain it, and to her of all people, who had been happy to trample over\nher own father, mother and brother if she could use them as a ladder to her\nown ambitions. “And some people will always be a threat. Orso’s girl Hildi\nis too naive, and Bremer dan Gorst is too stubborn, and I wouldn’t trust that\nbastard Tunny to carry my chamber pot. Honestly, I’m a long way from\ntrusting Teufel. The woman’s proved herself quite the plotter. I worry she’s\nnot loyal—”\n“You worry she’s too loyal, you mean, but not to you.”\n“What’s the difference?”\n“She has proved herself effective. My father is gone and Pike was never\napprehended. We must have someone competent in charge of the\nInquisition. There are hundreds of Breakers and Burners still at large.\nThousands, maybe. We have to root them out.” Her grazed cheek tightened\nas she clenched her jaw. “We have to make sure nothing like the Great\nChange can ever happen again.”\n“It didn’t turn out too badly.” He caught her staring at him, shocked.\n“All right, if it makes you happy, I’ll give Teufel a chance to prove herself.”\n“It will make me less unhappy, at least.”\n“Anything for you, my love,” he said, sulkily. “Don’t you trust me?”\n“It can be hard to trust men who stab their allies in the back.”\n“I don’t plan to do it once a week!” he snapped. “Or ever again,” he\nadded, hurriedly.

And as a point of fact, he’d\nstabbed him in the front. “At Stoffenbeck I bloody dithered, and we bloody\nlost, and I swore I’d never let a moment slip past again. So I saw an\nopportunity and I grabbed it. For us. I thought you’d be pleased!”\nThe truth was she’d changed, and not for the better. He’d said his vows\nto someone who let no scruple get in her way. But then she’d said hers to a\nman who could fasten his own belt without help. That’s marriage. People\nchange, and not always in the way you want, and you’re chained together\nanyway.\nLeo took a breath as they reached the great doors, fabulously carved\nwith food and drink and celebration, only slightly spoiled by a burned patch\nand a few axe marks. “We have to be united,” he said, wondering who he\nwas trying to convince. “For the sake of the children. For the sake of the\nnation. Our marriage made sense. It still makes sense. It makes more sense\nthan ever.”\nApplause rang out as Savine swept into the Hall of Mirrors, wearing a\nradiant smile.\n“Lord and Lady Brock!” bellowed Glaward, smashing his big hands\ntogether.\nThere were perhaps two hundred Representatives gathered there,\nstanding up to clap from a mismatched array of seating scavenged from\nacross the Agriont. Battered armchairs spilling stuffing, royal dining chairs\nand children’s schooling chairs, even a milking stool and one great curved\nbench somehow salvaged from the ruins of the Lords’ Round, scorched at\none end.\nSavine had not set foot in that building during Risinau’s reign, but even\nshe could tell the balance of the Representatives had greatly changed since\nthen. Less than half this crowd had been voted for, and those were mostly\nfrom the richer towns and districts. Landowners, merchants, men of\nbusiness. The rest had all once been nobles. Members of the Open Council\nlucky and unprincipled enough to slip from one body to another. Now Leo\nhad made them nobles again. There were even a few women, taking the\nplaces of fathers, brothers, husbands who had met their ends in the Great\nChange. On the front row, Lords Isher and Heugen gave their own\ncontinuing survival a standing ovation, heavy with the furs and chains of\naristocracy they had so eagerly cast off.\nThousands of reflections applauded, too, of course. In places a broken\nmirror split a face into mismatched halves, or a shattered one smashed the\nworld into a thousand distorted fragments. Smears of paint still clung in the\ncorners where the slogans had been hastily scrubbed away. But then the\nHall of Mirrors was a vast room. Putting it right would be the work of\nweeks. The palace? Years. The Agriont? Decades. The city of Adua? The\nUnion as a whole? Could any of it really go back together?\nSavine remembered Judge falling. That flash of her sneer as she dropped\naway.

And yet she could not stop thinking of it. The\nhand at her throat. The parapet grinding into her back. The hollow sucking\nin her stomach as she tumbled over.\nShe clenched her fist as she sat facing those ranks of false smiles, nails\ncutting sharp into her palm. She told herself she was safe. The\nRepresentatives might well have been outnumbered by Leo’s heavily armed\nAnglanders, standing watchful at every door and window. She could not\nhave been safer. She had to focus on what could be changed, and change it\nfor the better. She glanced down at her infant daughter, nudged the blanket\nfrom her sleeping face. She had to turn her back on the past and focus on\nthe future.\n“Are you all right?” Zuri murmured in her ear.\nSavine forced out a smile. “I should be asking you that.”\nZuri looked as composed as ever. She had not breathed a word of\nwhatever tortures she had endured beneath the House of Questions and\nSavine had not the courage to ask. That way she could almost pretend it had\nnever happened. Except there were some strange marks on the backs of\nZuri’s hands now. Pinpricks. Dimples. Not exactly scars. But not quite\nnormal, either.\nZuri saw her looking and worked the sleeves of her dress down over\nthem.\n“My friends!” called Leo as the clapping faded. “My peers! Noblemen\nand commoners! Representatives of the people of the Union! The Great\nChange… is behind us!”\nThe applause at that was even louder. Few indeed mourned its passing,\nand Leo had made sure any that did occupied cells in the House of\nQuestions rather than seats in this chamber.\n“Thanks to the courage of my wife, Lady Brock—” He was interrupted\nby cheers, mostly from the commoners’ side of the room.\n“The Darling of the Slums!” someone shouted.\n“The Mother of the Nation!” roared another, smashing his hands\ntogether.\nSavine had to force out another smile. Kindly meant, she was sure, but\ntheir clamour reminded her too much of the crowd at her trial. Of the mobs\non the day of the Great Change. She was safe. All those guards. But it was\nas if her body had not quite realised it. Sweat prickled under her clothes.\nLeo, looking slightly put out at the admiration for his wife, held up his\nhand for silence. “Thanks to Lady Brock, Judge has been thrown down. The\nBurners and the Breakers are routed, their ringleaders dead, captured or\neven now being hunted down. They’ll find there’s nowhere to hide! They\nwon’t scrub the blood of innocents from their clawing hands. Justice will\nfind them out, whatever hole they wriggle into!”\nMore applause. Savine had to admit she was impressed. She had always\nbeen more comfortable with small rooms, intimate groups, hushed\nwhispers. But Leo knew how to fill a hall. “He speaks well,” she murmured.\n“Vanity, a loud voice and a loose relationship with the truth,” whispered\nZuri. “All the qualities of a successful politician.”"

Was there something horrible in that?\nGiven the price? A hundred reflections of Savine looked on in adoring\ntriumph, but she could see the pale worry hidden in those copies of her own\nbruised face. She was not sure she had ever really loved him, but there had\nbeen plenty to admire, once. He had been generous, honest and brave. She\nhad wanted him to be more ruthless. More ambitious. More calculating. She\nhad moulded him into her image. Now she found she had much preferred\nhim before.\n“We must bring back the best of the past!” he was calling. “Families\nonce honoured by a ‘dan’ in their name will be honoured again. Our\nrestored Open Council will be made up of commoners and noblemen in\nequal numbers, united in their purpose, with respect given by every\nmember, to every member. A grand declaration has been prepared to that\neffect. I trust everyone here will sign their names to it and join us in this\nbrave new dawn. This new sunrise!”\nZuri laid the great book open on the table and turned it around to face\nthe Representatives. Neat blocks of her perfect calligraphy on one side.\nSpaces for two hundred signatures on the other. Savine had brought her\nlawyer Temple over from the Near Country to help draw it up, the keenest\neye she knew for both the art and science of a contract. Leo might like to\nharp on the past, but this paved the way for a new government, a new\nmonarch, a new Union.\nIsher sprang up from his chair. “I will be honoured to be the first to\nsign!” Though no one had asked him to be.\n“And I the second!” shouted Heugen, not to be outdone.\n“We must institute a new government!”\n“One based on justice and fairness!”\n“We must return to our principles,” said Leo, sternly. “And as the first\nstep, we must elect a new king.”\nThe lords, clearly prepared for this development, applauded again, but\nSavine saw worried faces on the other side of the room. The Burners might\nhave humiliated the king, after all, but even they had not presumed to\nreplace him. An old man with wispy hair was finally urged to his feet,\nclasping his hands, more like a supplicant approaching the throne than a\nproud Representative of the people.\n“My Lord Brock, if I may… no one here, I am sure, doubts your\nmotives…” He glanced nervously towards Leo’s many loyal soldiers. “Or\ndreams of denying your contribution, or disagrees with a word of your\nadmirable speech…”\n“I sense a but coming,” said Isher, one white eyebrow raised.\n“But when it comes to electing a new king… do we not still have…\nwell… an old one to worry about?”\nThe silence was total. Then Leo shrugged. “I’ve always been more of a\ndoer than a worrier.”\nMocking laughter from the noblemen’s benches.\n“But, Lord Brock, Orso is the anointed High King of the Union.

He cannot be simply dismissed—”\n“Oh, I find he can,” said Leo, “like that.” He snapped his fingers with an\nechoing crack. “He’s put right out of my mind.” Some of the lords crowed.\nOthers mockingly snapped their fingers in the old man’s face. Others\nsneered their contempt for the entire commoner’s side of the chamber, their\nscorn reflected in the mirrors over and over, into the far distance. Unity and\nrespect, it seemed, were only for those who did as they were told.\nFor once, everything was going just the way Leo hoped.\n“I’d like a show of hands!” he told the Hall of Mirrors. “Nothing hidden.\nNothing suspect. Each man makes his loyalty clear. Now. An open vote for\nour new king.” A vote observed by him, who had all the armed men in the\ncity, not to mention at least a hundred in this room, firmly under his\ncommand. Only a fool calls for a vote when he hasn’t made sure of the\noutcome, after all.\nIsher stood, precisely on cue. “I propose that the new monarch picks up\nthe bloodline of the old! I propose that our new king should be the natural\ngrandson of our much-missed King Jezal.” A man he’d showered with scorn\nwhen it suited him. “I propose, as our next ruler, the infant Harod dan\nBrock!”\nLeo watched the Representatives. Reading their expressions. Guessing\ntheir intentions. Many weren’t happy. But none had the stomach for a fight.\nThey’d have voted for a cart of dung if it meant things went back to some\nkind of normal, and business could be done, and jokes made, and strolls\ntaken in the sun, without the nagging fear of the long drop from the Tower\nof Chains.\nLeo gave Glaward the nod. “All those Representatives who wish to vote\nfor the infant Harod dan Brock as the next High King of the Union,” he\nroared, “raise your hands!”\nOn the noblemen’s side of the hall, arms shot up so fast it was a wonder\nthey didn’t fly off. On the commoners’ side they were slower. But they soon\nsaw which way the wind was blowing. With varying expressions of worry,\ndismay and disgust they raised their hands. Only a few stubborn holdouts\nsat glaring at the prospective monarch, arms folded, and Leo took careful\nnote of their names. They could be tastefully weeded out later.\nHe didn’t look much like a king, as Leo glanced around. He looked like\na white bundle in the arms of his mother, who with her unerring instinct for\nthe centre of attention appeared to have swapped babies while the voting\nwas underway. But King Harod the Second was raised to the throne, as his\ngrandfather King Jezal the First had been, by near-unanimous accord.\nThe ringing applause jerked the infant monarch from his sleep and\ncaused him to start bleating. But he’d done his work for today. Savine\ncaught Zuri’s eye and nodded towards the door, and the cries of the latest\nHigh King of the Union faded from the room.\nHeugen was already on his feet. “His Majesty is, quite clearly, too young"

The commoners were less happy than ever, but\nJurand gave a subtle signal and the guards began thumping the butts of\nwell-sharpened polearms on the tiles to send up a menacing rattle, and it\nquickly spurred the loiterers to their feet. Judge had taught them well.\nNobody wanted to be the last one sitting. They’d let the sluice open a crack\nand the flood had forced it wide. Now there was no closing it, and they all\nwere swept away into the future.\nLeo gritted his teeth, rocked his weight forwards and stood. Ignoring the\npain was easy. He’d been through the fire but, seeing his reflection in the\nmany mirrors, it wasn’t flattery to say he was still a fine-looking figure.\n“My thanks! I humbly accept this great honour, this great responsibility.\nI’m a soldier first, but now is the time for healing wounds. For reforging\nwhat’s been broken, stronger than ever. For making us a Union again!” He\nthumped his fist on the table. “We’ll have a new age, my friends! Not the\ncorruption of the old regime. Not the folly of the Breakers or the madness\nof the Burners. The best of both worlds! Justice and good government for\nall!”\nNow there was wholehearted support. The Representatives were already\nrushing forwards. Queueing up to sign. Noblemen first, as was only right,\nIsher smiling at their head.\nThe sun rose on a new age. One that Leo would shape as he saw fit.\nSavine might not like how he’d done it, but it was done, and all their\nambitions realised. How could she not be pleased? How could she not be\ngrateful?\nLeo lurched around on his false leg to grin at her.\nBut she was sitting up tall to look towards the grand declaration,\nwatching intently as the first signatures were scratched beside it.\nWe Must Have Enemies\nV\nick was so tired that when she sat, she nearly missed the chair. She’d\nbeen tired for months. For years. She couldn’t remember not being tired.\nAnd the broken nose by no means helped.\nBut prisoners won’t interrogate themselves.\n“So…” she said, the word a slightly painful sigh. “Master Sarlby.”\nThe sight of his face made her feel a bit better about her own. Gunnar\nBroad had smashed it to barely recognisable mush. You could’ve said he\nwas lucky to be alive, after the beating he’d taken.

It just made her tired, now.\n“Where’s the Weaver?” she asked, without much hope of an answer.\n“Where’s Pike?”\n“I don’t know,” he growled. “But if I did, you think I’d tell you?”\nShe glanced, heavy-lidded, at the box of instruments. “We could try it\nand see.”\n“You’re a traitor. To your kind. To yourself.” He worked his tongue\naround his broken teeth and spat on the table. “You’re a liar and a thief and\na traitor to everything.”\nVick shrugged. “And?”\n“And you’ll never beat us! We’ll be back! More of us than ever! More’n\nyou can count!”\nIt wasn’t the least bit funny, but Vick couldn’t help herself, she snorted\nout a chuckle, then had to wince at the flash of pain across her face. “Folk\ncan’t wait to be rid of you. Breakers and Burners, they’re cheering the end\nof you. You said you’d strike a blow for the common man. All you did was\nstarve them, freeze them and kill them.”\nShe sat forwards with a grunt. Damn, she was aching. “Truth is—and\ntake it from someone who spent a dozen years in prison—in the end, people\ndon’t really care much about being free. They want to be warm and well fed\nand to not have to worry. In particular, they want to not have to worry about\nbeing thrown off a tower for wearing the wrong shoes.”\nSarlby frowned down at the table. She thought it was a frown, anyway.\nHard to tell exactly where the corners of his mouth were. “We were in the\nright,” he muttered, though it sounded like he was trying to convince\nhimself, rather than her. “You’ll see.”\n“I doubt I will. But I know you won’t.” Vick pressed a thumb into her\nstiff hip as she worked her way up from the table. “They’re hanging you\ntomorrow.”\nTallow was waiting outside in the damp-smelling corridor, a book\nclutched in his hands and his big, sad eyes on her, as if he still hoped, even\nnow, that she might somehow have the answers. Damn, he was more like\nher brother than ever. That made her tired, too.\n“Another one for the list?” he asked, falling in beside her, their footsteps\nechoing dully from the damp walls.\nShe gave a grunt, eyeing the doors as they passed.\nTallow shook his head as he made a little mark in his book. “Feels like\nthe Lord Regent’s lists are even longer than Judge’s were. At least they’re\nbeing dealt with quietly. Not splattered across the moat.”"

Not splattered across the moat.”\n“That’s better, is it?”\n“I guess once these are cleared that’ll be it. Back to normal.”\n“That’s what the Breakers said. And the Arch Lector before them, for\nthat matter. A couple of enemies to cross out. Just get to the bottom of the\nlist. Except the list kept getting longer.” She ventured a little sniff, a squeak\nof barely moving air in her swollen face, a hint of salty snot at the back of\nher throat which she could never quite manage to swallow. “We must have\nenemies, Tallow. Always.”\n“You’re a ray of sunshine.”\n“Sunshine’s not really appropriate for an executioner. Specially one with\na broken nose.”\nThey rounded the corner and Vick stopped dead.\n“Oh, bloody hell,” squeaked Tallow.\nThey’d been expecting her, but the sight of Savine dan Brock under the\nHouse of Questions was still as shocking as suddenly spying a diamond in\nthe gutter. She looked a different woman from the one Vick first met in that\nbouncing carriage on the way to Valbeck, with the glassy perfection of an\nexpensive doll. The same immaculate poise, perhaps, the same assessing\neye, but more honest. More human. Fewer jewels, less ornament, lots of\nvirtuous white. The Mother of the Nation, they were calling her. She’d even\nsomehow turned the clipped hair and the scar into advantages. She looked\nbeautiful and like she didn’t care a shit about anyone else’s opinion.\n“Lady Regent.” Vick gave an awkward bow. “I apologise, but my\ncurtsy’s a thing no one of your refined tastes should be forced to see.”\n“I have braved worse horrors, Inquisitor Teufel. Are you Inquisitors\nagain?”\n“I’m not sure anyone really knows at this point.”\n“We are all finding a course through uncharted waters.” Though she\nlooked to Vick as if she knew exactly where she was headed. “Are you well,\nMaster Tallow?”\n“Tolerably so…” he managed to gurgle out. “My lady.”\n“Tolerably well is as well as can be hoped for these days. I understand\nyou swore an oath of loyalty to my son.”\nVick raised her brows. Even that felt like an effort. “I spent years\nworking for your father—your adopted father, not the other one—so I\nlearned how to take a hint. I got the strong feeling your husband’s offer was\nto swear the oath and stay in the Inquisitor’s chair or refuse and go in the\nprisoner’s one. But then I’ve always been a traitor and a liar so… wasn’t\ndifficult to do.” She gave a hopeless shrug. “Far be it from me to stand in\nthe way of the new Union. Or the new new Union, is it?”\nThe Lady Regent had the good grace to show a touch of guilt about the\nway it had all turned out. She even managed to make that look good.\n“Please believe me when I say that things are not the way I wanted them.”\nYou can never let them see your feelings. Never let them think you’ve\ngot any.

All she could think of, for some reason, was Sibalt’s\nlast sad smile. Malmer and the rest dangling over the road out of Valbeck.\nAll those names carved into the Square of Martyrs. All those people who\nfell from the Tower of Chains.\nShe found she’d stepped close to Savine, found she was looking her\nright in the eye, found that, for once, she was being honest. “Just… tell me\nit’ll be better.” Her throat felt tight, like she still had Corporal Smiler’s\nhands around her bruised neck. “It doesn’t have to be some paradise.” She\nhad to force the words through gritted teeth. “But it can’t all be for nothing,\nyou understand? It can’t.”\nIt was quiet, in that shabby corridor, for a moment. The Lady Regent\nblinked at Vick as if she saw her for the first time. Then she gently nodded.\n“I understand. And I will do my best.”\n“Good.” Vick cleared her throat. “Good.” She turned away, trying to\nswallow that lump in her throat, wiping her eyelids with a knuckle. Tallow\nstood against the wall, staring at her like he’d seen Euz rise from the grave.\n“What?” Vick snarled at him.\n“Nothing,” he squeaked.\nShe set her jaw and gripped the door-handle. “Let’s get on with it, then.”\nShe’d never had much dislike for the prisoners. Even disapproval was an\neffort these days. But for this one she could make an exception.\n“There are still some men it’s a pleasure to hang,” she said, planting her\nfists on the scarred tabletop.\nSpillion Sworbreck cringed in his chair, stripped naked, cheeks tracked\nwith the tears he’d notably failed to cry on behalf of all those he’d sent to\nthe long drop.\n“Inquisitor, please,” he babbled, “you are a woman of the world. You\nunderstand the position I was in, the compromises that had to be made. I\nam, I freely admit, a weak man. I have always been so easily led! Swept up\nby great passions and powerful personalities like a leaf on the wind! I am\npleading with you. I am begging you—”\n“No point asking my forgiveness,” said Vick. “I’m not allowed any. You\nmight have more luck with her.” She nodded towards the door. “But I\nwouldn’t bet on it.”\n“Oh,” he said, in a very small voice, as the Lady Regent swept in with\nchill majesty. “Oh dear.” She arranged herself on the Inquisitor’s chair with\na rustling of expensive silk while Sworbreck shrank further and further into\nhis seat, chains faintly clinking. If he could’ve sucked his head into his\nshoulders like a turtle, Vick imagined he would’ve.\n“He was caught at the docks,” she said. “Trying to get out of the city\ndisguised as a woman. One of the few people in the Circle of the World\nwho can safely say they look worse than me in a dress.”"

One of the few people in the Circle of the World\nwho can safely say they look worse than me in a dress.”\n“Lady Savine…” His eyelids fluttered and fresh tears ran down his face.\n“Lady Regent, I beg of you—”\n“Shut,” hissed Savine furiously through her gritted teeth, “your fucking\nmouth.” She closed her eyes, composing herself, took a breath, then opened\nthem, flinty hard. “Understand… the restraint it takes on my part not to see\nyou dragged up the Tower of Chains and flung to your death.”\n“I do understand, Your Highness, I do, I do, please, you must see, I… I\nlost perspective.”\n“Perspective? Is that what you lost?”\n“I got carried away… and not for the first time. When I was in the Far\nCountry, Fates help me… I am so easily dragged off course! I never learn!\nIt was the times… it was Judge… I didn’t know what I was doing!”\n“Please! All you got carried away with, Sworbreck, was your own\npower, and cruelty, and self-importance.”\n“I am a worm,” he whispered, head hanging, tears dripping. “An utter\nworm!”\n“Oh, no. Worms do some good.” Savine slowly sat back, lip wrinkled\nwith disgust, the angry flush fading from her cheek. “Cowardly liar you\nmay be, ridiculous fantasist you may be, disloyal scum you certainly are,\nbut for reasons I cannot divine… people listen to you.”\n“They do, Lady Savine!” A sudden hope lit his face. “Your Highness,\nLady Regent, I am ever so keen to be of service, in whatever humble and\nlowly way—”\n“You will write of me again,” said Savine.\n“I will?”\n“Just like you did in The Darling of the Slums. Your best work.”\nThe flicker of a smile on Sworbreck’s lips. “You think so?”\n“The best turd in the sewer,” growled Vick, making him cringe again.\n“You will rain praise upon me,” said Savine.\n“I will lavish you with compliments, Your Highness! I will burnish your\nlegend! I will raise you up on a cushion of eulogy. The deliverer of the\npeople! The Mother of the Nation! You and your children,” blubbered\nSworbreck. “And your noble husband—”\n“My children, yes. My husband can extol his own virtues.”\n“Sure you don’t want to hang this bastard?” asked Vick. Seemed there\nwas no more justice in the world than there had been when Judge sat in the\nCourt of the People. But then justice had always been in short supply.\nWho’d know better than her, who’d had years of her life stolen for someone\nelse’s crimes?\nThe Lady Regent considered her carefully. “You spent years working for\nmy father. You should have learned not to hang what you can use.” She\nnarrowed her eyes at Sworbreck. “I suggest you get to your press and keep\nit hot. You live now to make me loved. And you will live precisely as long\nas you are useful to me.” Savine stood, looking down her nose at the\nsobbing ex-prosecutor. “Not an instant longer.”"

The applause was\npositively thunderous. All the pent-up terror and frustration of the last few\nmonths released in an outpouring of joy and relief.\n“With thanks to our most radiant patron, Her Highness the Lady Regent\nand Mother of the King, Savine dan Brock!” Curnsbick humbly bowed his\nhead towards Savine’s box and she lowered her fan to give a nod and smile\nof her own. There was a kind of ripple through the audience as every face\nturned towards her. The ovation grew, if anything, even louder. Her smile\ngrew, if anything, even wider. Joyous screeches, admiring coos. Someone\nshouted, “The Mother of the Nation!”\nSavine liked to think she had changed. She was by no means the same\nwoman who had sat in this box two years ago, jealously hoarding up the\nadulation. But who dislikes being applauded? She blew Curnsbick a kiss.\nSentimental folly, perhaps. But that seemed to be in fashion.\n“So much has been wantonly destroyed!” called Curnsbick as the\nclapping tailed off. “Everyone here has lost friends! Colleagues. Partners.\nFamily.” His voice faded to a croak and he had to pause. The crowd\nmurmured encouragement, wiped eyes, urged the Great Machinist on. He\nmade a fist and shook it at no one in particular. “But we who remain must\nnot allow ourselves to be buried in the past! We cannot afford to wallow in\nregrets and recriminations. We must look to the future. Our departed friends\nwould not want their seats here to sit empty. Already we have new\nmembers, young investors, dynamic inventors boiling over with ideas and\nenthusiasm, keen to push the great work forward!”\nRowdy cheering. While attention was elsewhere, Savine slipped behind\nher fan and took the tiniest pinch of pearl dust, eyelashes fluttering at that\ndelicious, invigorating burning in her face. Thank the Fates, trade of all\nkinds was flowing once again, at least for those with the money. She liked\nto think she had changed, but the Mother of the King, like any mother,\nneeds a little something from time to time.\n“A new age dawns, my friends! A new beginning!” There were tears on\nCurnsbick’s cheeks. “The Great Change is at our backs and before us lies a\nvista of prosperity such as mankind has never looked upon before!” They\nwere already on their feet. Whooping, clapping, weeping. An almost\nreligious rapture. Curnsbick struggled to scream his final words. “Progress,\nmy friends! Progress!”\nSavine stood to clap herself. “Well said!” Zuri was already offering a\nhandkerchief so she could dab a tear from the corner of her eye without\ncompromising her powder. “Well said.”\nA considerable crowd had gathered beneath the two great chandeliers"

Knots of brightly dressed gentlemen split and merged, sucked\ninto dizzying currents and whirlpools, the ladies pale dots on the flood.\nHer own white nursing dress was everywhere, her own modest lack of\njewels, her own wigless, clipped hair and, mercy, did she even see a woman\nwith a scar like hers painted on? Savine had taken pride in being at the\nforefront of fashion, but this slavish imitation was something new.\nSomething at once gratifying and slightly troubling.\n“The Lady Regent!” someone almost screamed.\nThe talk stopped instantly. Every eye turned to her.\nFor a moment, Savine felt a sucking of terror. As if they might see\nthrough her, to all the secrets, and the guilt, and the things she wished she\nhad not done. As if they might denounce her on the spot and drag her to the\nTower of Chains.\nThen Curnsbick stepped forwards. “Your Highness,” he murmured,\nlowering himself to one knee. As if it was arranged, every man and woman,\nseveral hundred of the richest and most talented in the Union, sank down\nwith him, bowing, curtsying, competing viciously to get closest to the floor.\nSavine liked to think she had changed. She had taken a beating in\nValbeck. Reeled through the year afterwards, finally put herself back\ntogether, then taken another beating at Stoffenbeck. Everyone had taken a\nbeating in the Great Change. Then she had spent six months hiding, giving\nherself up to her babies, to her husband, to her charity, and finally taken yet\nanother beating in the Court of the People and on the roof of the Tower of\nChains. Though there, it had to be said, she had given far worse than she\ngot.\nSavine liked to think she had changed. Come through her ordeals a\nbetter woman. But perhaps she was like a leaf of steel, bent by great\npressure into new shapes but, given the chance, springing all too quickly\nback. In the warm draft of the foyer the embers of ambition flared up again\nas hot as ever. There was no denying the satisfaction she felt to see every\nman and woman not only seeking her money, not only seeking her\napproval, not only envying her, but kneeling before her.\nSavine liked to think she had changed. But who dislikes being knelt to?\nShe left them kneeling long enough to know she could have left them\nkneeling all night. Then she smiled her sweetest smile. “Don’t be\nridiculous, everyone. Please rise.”\nShe swallowed that horrible, lovely pearl dust bitterness and swept down\nthe steps into the foyer. Her foyer. Once she had fought battles here. Now\nshe reigned over the place as the unquestioned victor.

There was a wave of bowing heads, a rustle\nof curtsying skirts, a wake of awestruck respect wherever Savine passed.\n“One could get used to this,” murmured Zuri, sliding her pencil from\nbehind her ear, and she was right, as always. All Savine had to do was smile\nto bring them rushing forwards like pigs at feeding time.\n“My surveys show there is room for three thousand thoroughly modern\nhouses in the burned areas of the Three Farms alone. Thoroughly modern,\nYour Highness! Running water!”\n“New ships, Lady Regent. Towering ships. Cities on the salt, bristling\nwith cannon. Blow anything those Styrian bastards have out of the water.\nThe Union will rule the seas again!”\n“Have you had the opportunity to consider my designs, Lady Regent?\nBetter statues on the Kingsway that celebrate the new while harking back to\nthe glory of the old!”\n“A new and improved patent office must be the priority, Your Highness,\neverything is in turmoil, new standards for the new age…”\nZuri was, if anything, more skilful than ever, her pencil moving with\nalmost inhuman dexterity, noting anything worthwhile in the book\nshorthand, scoring in the appointments, chopping the coming days into\nslices of opportunity, assigning a worth to every sliver of Savine’s attention\nand not allowing a crumb to be wasted. It was very much like old times,\nonly better. Savine had missed the fan, like a wounded warrior might his\nsword, and back on the battlefield, she wielded it with twice the savagery.\n“Cannons are the thing, now, Lady Regent! With my new casting\ntechniques they fire at twice the speed, thrice the range, ten times the\nreliability!”\n“Rails are the thing! The potential, Your Highness, a woman of your\nvision cannot be blind to the potential…”\n“Roads on top of roads, can you imagine?”\n“Just a moment of your time, Your Highness! Just an instant!”\nOne by one, she brought them forwards with their schemes, their\ndreams, the light of certainty burning bright in their eyes. Her slightest\nsmile lit their faces with delight. The hint of a frown doused them with\nhorror. When she ended each interview with a snap of her fan she thought\nof cringing through the streets of Valbeck, hiding in the woods after\nStoffenbeck, standing helpless in the dock before Judge, and revelled in her\npower.\n“The one thing I need is the support of the state!”\n“A word from you would make all the difference!”\n“A moment with the Lord Regent!”\n“The one thing I need!”\n“Curnsbick!” droned Savine, offering her hand.\n“Your Highness,” said the Great Machinist, leaning down to kiss it.\n“And Zuri, as radiant as ever. When the hell are you coming to work for\nme?”\n“One minute past never,” she said, quickly checking the golden watch\nthat had replaced the silver one around her neck."

Perhaps\nthinking of his hoist up the Tower of Chains. Or his automatic hanging\nmachine. “But many did not. Sometimes I think… I should have done more.\nBut my old partner Majud always told me a man of business stays neutral.”\nHe cleared his throat, shook off the sombre mood, looked to the future. “I\nam planning to lay a rail route up to Valbeck, you know! With a bridge by\nyour friend Master Kort. I expect excellent returns for my investors.”\n“You have never disappointed your investors, but I have other business\nto attend to.”\n“Doubtless. The ground is already broken on your grand new orphanage,\nI hear.” He leaned close to murmur, “And I understand you bought up half\nthe Three Farms for next to nothing. That might yet turn out your best\ninvestment of all.”\nSavine would not have been surprised if it turned out one of the best in\nhistory, especially since she’d bought up half the Arches, too. “For the sake\nof the tenants, you understand. Most of them are paying less than half rent.”\nFor the time being, at least…\n“I always knew you had a generous heart.”\n“I remember you saying something of the sort. I may have a gift for you,\nin fact.”\nCurnsbick peered at her over his eye-lenses. “Why do I imagine you will\nwant something in return?”\n“Because you know my generous heart pumps blood to a calculating\nbrain. It is a chair.”\n“I am not quite ready for retirement, Your Highness.”\n“No fear of that. The chair is a decidedly uncomfortable one.” Her turn\nto murmur, shielding her mouth with her fan. “On the Closed Council.”\nHe tried to stay calm, but she noted the eager twitch of his fingers. “Who\nelse have you asked?”\n“You are my first choice, of course.”\n“Then you would want to approach me with some friends already in\nplace.”\nSavine smiled. “Perhaps you know me too well. I have approached\nVallimir and Kort.”\n“And they said yes?”\n“Can you imagine either of them refusing me before I was Mother of the\nKing? Now?” She glanced across the foyer stuffed with breathless\nsycophants desperately trying to catch her eye and laughed. “Please.”\nCurnsbick glanced towards her heavy-handed bodyguard, lowering his\nvoice. “And… your husband has given his permission?”\nSavine did not like the word “permission.” It galled her that people\nmight think she had to ask for it. “He will not object.”"

Her eye had been caught by\nsomeone loitering near the wall.\nSelest dan Heugen was, for once, not trying to make an exhibit of\nherself. In her efforts to fade into the background, indeed, she had done\neverything short of wear a dress that matched the wallpaper. But Savine was\nnot about to let her slip away so easily.\n“Selest!” she called. “I hope you aren’t trying to avoid me.”\nHer curtsy had something of the cornered animal about it as Savine bore\ndown with her phalanx of guards. “Only… because I’m afraid to face you,”\nshe said, which was honest, at least. “Your Highness, I have to apologise—”\n“It might be a good idea.”\n“I… always liked to think of myself as fearless.” Selest looked down\nat the floor as though she was blinking back tears. “But the truth is…\nfaced with real danger… I was an utter coward. It is… a hard thing to\nlearn about oneself.”\n“If the Great Change taught us anything, it is that the vast majority of us\nare cowards the vast majority of the time.”\n“Not you.”\nSavine smiled. Is there anything finer than seeing an enemy humbled? “I\nhave my moments. But we are all offered a new beginning, now. A chance\nto make ourselves afresh. You may not have covered yourself in glory in the\nCourt of the People, but you emerged alive. You are ruthless, ambitious,\nclever and persistent. Qualities I could make use of, if you were willing to\nserve His August Majesty.”\nSelest swallowed. “I am eager to serve him, of course.” She looked up\nnervously from under her lashes. “Or Your Highness.” Which was getting\ncloser to it. “Only… tell me how.”\nProbably she feared she would be sent as emissary to distant Thond or\nput into service in the palace as a carpet. Savine was somewhat tempted.\nBut one must work with the tools one has, as her father had once been fond\nof saying.\nShe made Selest’s distress last just a little longer, then tossed it out as if\nit was nothing to remark upon. “On the Closed Council.”\n“But I…” Selest looked as if a fan’s waft could have knocked her over.\n“Women, surely, are not permitted—”\n“I was very careful over the language in the Grand Declaration.

For the rest, no amount of seeking will make the slightest\ndifference.”\nShe flicked out her fan to bring the conversation to a close, but Sulfur\ndid not take the hint. “Do you imagine that you have won?” he asked.\nShe smiled at the foyer full of smiles, queen in all but name. “It looks\nrather like it.”\n“Looks can lie.”\n“Almost as proficiently as magi.”\nHe did not like that at all, different-coloured eyes angrily narrowed. “My\nmaster will be satisfied,” he said, an edge of menace on his voice. “There is\nno hiding from him.”\n“Who’s hiding?” asked Savine, lifting her chin. “The Breakers did their\nworst in Valbeck, and here I am.

You tried your very best to destroy me, too, as I\nrecall, blabbing my ugliest secrets around town, and it only made me more\npowerful.”\n“Your power is borrowed.” He pronounced each word with furious care.\n“And as any banker will tell you, what is borrowed must be repaid. With\ninterest.”\nAs he leaned forwards to hiss the last word, one of Savine’s bodyguards\nstepped smoothly in front of him. “Is this man bothering you, Your\nHighness?”\n“Not really,” said Savine. “But throw him out anyway.”\nTwo guards seized Sulfur under the arms and marched him towards the\ndoor, his feet scarcely brushing the ground. The constant presence of armed\nmen can be a little harsh on the nerves, but they certainly have their uses.\n“You will hear from us!” he called as he was dragged through the crowd.\n“My master will be satisfied!”\n“Your master wants something from me?” Savine turned away with a\nsnort. “He can get in line.” And the mocking laughter of the crowd followed\nthe magus to the door.\nSavine had not made society a snake pit.

The ranks of\ndark-uniformed soldiers stood to stiff attention. The buglers blew an\nawkward fanfare. The threadbare crowd gave scattered cheers as Lady\nFinree stepped to the quay, a few dozen seasick worthies of Angland in her\nwake.\nLeo limped forward, his one working arm out to embrace her. “Mother!”\nYou couldn’t have said he was used to his wounds. The pain, the shame,\nthe seething frustration. But they’d become familiar. Routine. Seeing the ill-\ndisguised horror on his mother’s face was like looking at himself in the\nmirror, mutilated, for the first time.\n“It looks worse than it is,” he said. “Curnsbick made the leg for me. So\ngood I’m thinking of having him replace the other one! And I’m getting\nsome movement back in the arm now, too.” He waved his left elbow about\nas much as he could, trying not to let the pain show and hoping his limp\nhand didn’t flop from his jacket.\n“Leo.” She brushed a speck of fluff from his uniform, and held him\ntight, very clearly trying to fight back tears. “I thought I might never see\nyou again.” And she pressed her head against his chest. Her hair had much\nmore grey in it than the last time he saw her. By the dead, could it really be\nless than a year ago?\n“I’m… glad you were wrong.” He could’ve stayed there all day, holding\nher. But people were watching. A sentimental attachment to his mother\nmight look well. A desperate need for her support would not. He cleared his\nthroat, and stepped away, and gave her a moment to dab her damp eyes.\n“Your carriage awaits.”\nHe did his best to walk smoothly, open the door, help his mother up. But\nhis iron foot slid on the step as he followed and the heel got caught. “Damn\nit,” he snarled, twisting it, pulling it, getting worse tangled in his frustration.\n“Leo, let me—”\n“No need!” he snapped, finally heaving himself free and twisting back\ninto his seat, teeth gritted against the pain.\nHe thumped at the door and the carriage lurched off towards the Agriont.\nHe didn’t like the dismay in his mother’s eyes, so he frowned out of the\nwindow at the honour guards riding to either side, harness polished to\ngleaming mirror-brightness, and wished he was riding with them. He\nlistened to the hooves pounding the cobbles and thought of the charge at\nRed Hill. The Young Lion, riding to glory.\n“I always thought you hated carriages,” said his mother.\n“I do, but…” But it hurt him to ride, he was in more pain than he could\nstand and the thought of more made him sick. “Anything for you. Did you\nbring more soldiers?”\n“Another regiment should arrive tomorrow. I swear there’s hardly a man\nunder thirty left in Ostenhorm.”\n“I need every loyal Anglander,” said Leo. “To keep the peace. To keep\norder. To keep the people… safe.”\nHis mother looked even more dismayed at that. “I remember what your"

To keep the people… safe.”\nHis mother looked even more dismayed at that. “I remember what your\nfather used to say… about the founding principles of the Union.” She had\nalways thought Leo’s father was a fool, and he was starting to think she had\nbeen right. “You can have too much order, Leo. People need liberty.”\n“Tell that to those splattered to mincemeat at the bottom of the Tower of\nChains,” he snapped. “Liberty is a luxury we can’t afford right now.”\n“Of course,” she said, looking down at the floor. “We have to take things\nat the right pace. Have to be cautious.” She looked up at him again, and she\nlooked pale. “Have you heard from… the First of the Magi?”\nLeo frowned. “That old fool? Why would I have?”\n“In the past, he held… a great deal of influence.”\n“In the past, maybe.”\n“It was partly through his patronage that your father became Lord\nGovernor.”\n“What?”\nHis mother leaned forwards. A woman who’d fought an army of\nNorthmen to a draw, and she looked positively scared. “Undertakings were\nmade to him. He is not a man to simply let a debt go.”\n“Sadly, the banks all burned in the Great Change. I rather think the debts\nburned with them.”\n“I very much doubt he will see it that way.”\n“What do I care how he sees it?”\nHis mother blinked. “Leo, you don’t understand—”\n“I have bigger problems than making wizards happy! Have you seen the\nstate of things here?” And he waved towards the window. A burned-out\nstretch of the city was rolling into view, scorched windows and doorways\nyawning empty.\n“By the Fates,” breathed his mother, eyes wide at the sight. Leo had got\nused to the city’s scars, perhaps, the way he had to his own, but now he saw\nthose fresh, too.\n“The bastards ruined everything,” he said, clenching his fist. “It can’t\never happen again. We need a strong army. A vigilant Inquisition. The\nBreakers and Burners are still there, in the provinces. Like bloody maggots\nin the guts of the nation! We need to ferret them out. Teach our enemies to\nfear us. The bloody Styrians, the bloody Gurkish, the bloody Old Empire.\nWe have to get a grip.”\nIt seemed obvious good sense to him, but his mother looked more\ndismayed than ever. “We have to show strength, but… surely we need\nfriends before we look for more enemies—”\n“You know I never looked for enemies!” He turned sourly back to the\nwindow. “I just beat the ones who looked for me.”\nHe did some watery smiling, some half-hearted waving, but there\nweren’t many people on the Middleway. If the Lady Regent had been in the\ncarriage no doubt they’d have packed in a dozen deep. They pissed\nthemselves for the so-called Mother of the Nation and barely spared a\nthought for the man who’d actually got the job done. But there it was.\nBeing a hero had always been a thankless task. You did it because it was\nright, not for the prizes."

You did it because it was\nright, not for the prizes.\n“How is Savine?” asked his mother.\n“Very popular,” he said, grudgingly. “Have you had the bloody\npamphlets up in Angland? Savine, bare-breasted in the Court of the People,\nshielding her babies from the spears of the Burners. Savine, duelling with\nJudge on the roof of the Tower of Chains and throwing her down like your\nbloody friend Bayaz threw down the Master Maker. Savine, bringing shelter\nto the orphans, bread to the starving, hope to the hopeless. The Darling of\nthe Slums! The Mother of the Nation!” He gave a snort. “Anyone would\nthink she ended the Great Change single-handed.”\nHis mother raised one brow. “I seem to remember a few mildly\nexaggerated songs sung of your victories, up in the North. She has been\nthrough a lot.”\nIf that was meant to make him less annoyed, it failed. “We both have,”\nhe grunted.\n“It can be difficult, when children appear. Your father and I didn’t couple\nfor months after you were born.”\n“Must you?”\n“Well, it’s true. You cried all the time. You’d only sleep in bed with me.\nIt can change things, in a marriage, that’s all I’m saying.”\n“She blames me,” he said, slumping in his seat. He’d never been able to\nhide anything from his mother for long. “She blames me for everything. For\nmaking our son a king. For making her wildest ambitions come true. For\nbringing order back to the Union. For everything.”\nHis mother raised the other brow. “And is it your fault?”\n“Ten breaths off the boat and you’re taking her side?”\n“It’s a marriage, Leo. There shouldn’t be sides.”\n“Feels like there are, though.” He frowned out of the window at the\nlonely well-wishers. “And everyone’s on hers.”\nSavine had wasted no time making herself at home in the palace she so\nresented Leo for providing. She’d worked her usual magic on a set of rooms\neven more cavernous than the ones they’d lived in before the Great Change.\nRooms on the ground floor, since Leo was scarcely friendlier with stairs\nthese days than Arch Lector Glokta used to be.\n“Your grandfather!” said Leo’s mother, one hand to her chest as she\ngazed up at the huge canvas of Lord Marshal Kroy glaring towards victory.\n“Where he can stand guard over his family,” said Savine, gliding\nforwards with her best smile. One Leo rarely saw these days.\n“Savine! You look breathtaking, as always.” They embraced while Leo\nstood by, grimacing at the ache in his stump. His mother held Savine out at\narm’s length, taking in her clipped hair, her clothes, her scar. “And\nthoroughly modern, of course.”\n“I could say the same of you.”\n“But you wouldn’t dare, because it would be rank flattery.” Already they\nwere wandering off, arm-in-arm, leaving Leo to lurch painfully across the\nacres of floor to a side table so he could pour himself a drink."

He bit\nhis tongue, loitering in the doorway while the ladies advanced on the cribs.\n“This is Ardee,” Savine was cooing, lifting one of the babies. “She’s just\nbeen fed, so this is the ten breaths in which she’s happy.”\n“She has your eyes,” Leo’s mother flung over her shoulder at him.\n“I hope not,” he muttered. “They’re about the only things I have that still\nwork.”\nAll his mother’s attention was on the bundle in her arms, that gormless\ngrin on her face women get around babies, as if making a sucking sound is\na heroic achievement. “Oh, she’s a weight! You forget. Can I ask…\nhave your parents…?”\n“No,” said Savine. “No sign.”\n“I’m so sorry.” Leo’s mother put a hand on Savine’s arm. A touch of\nsimple support and sympathy. A touch she never gave him. “I was very\nmuch looking forward to seeing your mother again. I always enjoyed our\nchats.”\n“It would be nice… to know what became of them.” Savine put her hand\non top of Leo’s mother’s. Squeezed it. As if they were parent and child, and\nLeo was a pushy visitor getting in the way of their reunion. “But there are\nso many people who lost family in the Great Change. I suppose… one\nlearns to live with the doubts. And I have a new family now.” She beamed\ndown at the children. Leo didn’t get so much as a glance, of course. That\nwould’ve been far too much to ask.\n“So you do.” Leo’s mother handed Ardee back and leaned over Harod’s\ncot. “I suppose this must be His Majesty.” He gave a panicky clutch at the\nair as he was picked up. It always annoyed Leo, seeing his softness. Made\nhim want to shake the boy, tell him to be a man. The way his own father\nhad always done.\n“You shouldn’t coddle him,” grunted Leo.\n“Surely that’s exactly what a grandmother should do,” she said, fussing\nand rocking and squeaking.\nLeo had always imagined he’d be a wonderful father. To a boy, of\ncourse. A little copy of himself he could give a little sword to. They’d ride\nand wrestle and fence together. He took a sip of his wine, but it tasted bitter.\nHow could he do any of that now? Holding them was hard enough, with his\none good arm, his one good hand. All he could do by way of playing was\ndangle the useless fingers of the other in their faces.\nLeo’s mother put her wrinkled nose close to Harod’s blankets. “His\nAugust Majesty has soiled himself.”\n“I understand his great-grandfather King Guslav was prone to do the\nsame,” said Savine, and she scooped him into her arms and swept from the\nroom."

Always saying how proud he was of his son.”\nThat was the story they always told, but Leo remembered it differently.\nHis father had never been there, and when he had been he was stiff and\ndistant, and when Leo needed love he’d got empty sayings about being a\nman, and dry rot about the principles of the Union.\nHe remembered waking scared in the night, and he couldn’t find the pot,\nso he’d pissed in the cupboard. When his father found out he had refused to\nspeak to him for a week. As soon as he could he’d sent Leo off to Adua,\nthen to Uffrith, where the Dogman had been more of a father to him than\nhis own ever was.\nHe wanted to say it all. To puke up his resentments. He had his mouth\nopen to do it. But why bother? The past isn’t made of facts, not really, just\nstories people tell to make themselves feel better. To make themselves look\nbetter. Everyone was at it. Savine was the bloody queen of it, the Darling of\nthe Slums herself. He wondered what myths that worm Sworbreck was\nalready spinning about the past vile and bloody year. He took another heavy\nswig from his glass.\n“What is it, Leo? You seem… sulky.”\nIt was only then he realised how much he’d wanted her approval. A man\nwho’d made himself one of the most powerful in the Circle of the World,\nstill endlessly trying and failing to impress his mother. The Lord Regent of\nthe Union, jealous of his own babies.\n“Isn’t this what you were always telling me to do?” he demanded. “To\nbe shrewd? To be prudent? Isn’t this what Savine was always telling me to\ndo? To be ruthless? To be ambitious? Then I do it and somehow I’ve let you\nall down!”\n“Leo, don’t be ridiculous—”\n“I saved the fucking Union!” he snarled, lifting his glass to fling it\nagainst the wall, stopping himself at the last moment so all he managed was\nto pour wine down his sleeve. “Isn’t this what you wanted for me? To be a\nhero?” He took a step towards her, twisted his iron leg and tottered\nsideways, gasping with pain.\n“Leo, please.” She caught him. Held him. Laid her firm hand on his\nface. “I know I pushed you. I know I lectured you. I know I was too hard.\nI’m sorry for all of that. Perhaps you’ll see now you have children of your\nown… being a parent… there is no plan. It’s just a set of mistakes you\nhardly notice making. Please believe me…” She winced at his iron leg, as if\nshe felt the pain of it. “All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.”\nHe swallowed, tears burning at the back of his nose. He found his\nbalance again, pulled free of her, tugged his uniform straight. “I wish you’d\nfucking said so.”"

He’d sparred earlier, if you could call it\nsparring when he lumbered squeakily about the circle while Jurand lied that\nhe was getting better. He’d got frustrated, as usual, then he’d got angry, as\nusual, then he’d pushed himself far too hard, as usual. Now his back was\nthrobbing, too, sending stings all the way up into his neck. He wasn’t\ngetting better, he was getting worse.\nHe frowned down at the meat on his plate the way he’d once frowned\nacross the Circle at Stour Nightfall. An enemy he wasn’t sure he could beat.\nHe picked up his knife, tried to cut, but pressing gently it only slithered\naround in the widening pool of bloody gravy. He gritted his teeth, pressed\nharder, but now the whole plate slid about, slopping juice onto the polished\ntabletop.\n“Fuck,” he hissed. “Fuck it!” He wanted to snatch his meat up and rip\ninto the thing with his teeth. He could feel Savine’s impatience on his right.\nHis mother’s concern on his left. He was master of the Union, and the\nwomen in his life were having to stop themselves reaching across to cut up\nhis dinner.\n“My Lord and Lady Regent…” Solumeo Shudra leaned forwards with\nan oily smile. “We are most honoured by your invitation.” He was the\nleader of the Westport delegation, a big, dark-skinned, shaven-headed man\nwho looked more like a priest of Gurkhul than an honest fellow of the\nUnion. The other five were of every shape and colour. It faintly disgusted\nLeo that he was obliged to lap up the flattery of mongrels. But Savine said\nthey needed Westport’s money. So much to be rebuilt.\nHe’d always imagined absolute power meant doing whatever you\npleased, but it was starting to look like one sordid compromise after\nanother. He wished he was back in Uffrith, among the Northmen, where\nyou could say what you meant and eat any way you fucking pleased and a\nmissing limb or two won you admiration rather than pity.\n“And we are most honoured by your attendance,” said Savine, touching\nLeo gently on the shoulder as if they were one person, with one set of\nfeelings. “We are all here to reaffirm our commitment to the Union. To\nreaffirm our commitment to each other.” And she smiled at Leo so warmly,\nso fondly, she almost had him believing it. As if love was a machine she\ncould turn on with a lever.\n“It grieves me that leaders of the same great nation should never before\nhave met,” said Leo’s mother. “I so look forward to getting to know you all\nbetter.”\n“As do we, Lady Governor Finree,” said the greasiest of the\nWestporters.

The falseness was strangling.\n“It is well that we have a king again,” said Filio.\n“It is well that we look towards a stable future,” said Rosimiche.\n“It is well that Angland is once more inseparable from Midderland,” said\nShudra.\n“Anything else would be unthinkable,” said Savine.\n“But…” And Shudra raised his brows towards the empty chairs on the\nopposite side of the table. “It is most regrettable that Lord Governor Skald\nand the other representatives of Starikland have not attended.”\n“It is,” snapped Leo, pressing his fist into the tabletop and smearing it\nthrough spilled gravy. “He was given every opportunity, and I take it as a\npersonal affront that he—”\n“I am mediating between my son and Lord Governor Skald.” Leo’s\nmother laid her fingertips gently on the elbow of his ruined arm. That\ncalming touch she always used to use on him, the one you might use on a\npeevish horse, though these days he felt little but a numb prickling. “The\nposition is delicate, of course.

And the thought of getting back in the saddle,\nleading men in the field, being the Young Lion again, whoever the enemy,\nbrought on a surge of excitement. He glared across the table at Shudra and\nhis god-bothering stooges. “Anyone who threatens the stability of the Union\nwill regret it. Anyone. From outside. Or from inside. Do you take my\nmeaning?”\nShudra bowed his head. “Your Highness makes his meaning most\nplain.”\n“I’m a blunt soldier,” grunted Leo, shifting his grip on his knife, “and I\nlike blunt dealing.”\n“As do I.” It was the woman who spoke. Mozolia, was she called? Tall\nand heavy-shouldered, frowning at Leo from under her thick black and grey\nbrows. “Bluntly, then, it seems to us that the greatest threat to the stability\nof the Union currently comes from its last monarch.” Leo stiffened. He felt\nSavine stiffen beside him. “There are many who still feel loyalty to King\nOrso. He will always be a focus for discontent.”\nLeo slowly swallowed, slowly set down his knife, slowly sat forward,\nlooking this brazen bitch right in the eye. “I’m a blunt soldier. I like blunt\nsolutions.”\nThere was an utter silence in the room. For a long moment, it seemed no\none even breathed. Shudra winced slightly. Filio peered down at his meal."

It is\nmost regrettable, but, after all we have been through, after all the nation has\nbeen through…” Finally, she met Leo’s eye. That flinty look she used to\nhave, when trying to convince him to be more ruthless. “I would far rather\nhave another regret than another rebellion.”\nIt was more of a relief than Leo had expected to find the old Savine\nbeside him again. He turned his hand over and gripped hers tight. He\nneeded her guile. He needed her popularity with the masses. The dead\nknew, he couldn’t do bloody everything himself.\n“What a woman,” he said, treating the delegates from Westport to a\nbeaming smile. “I swear I’m the luckiest man in the world.” And he shoved\nhis plate away. “Now could someone bring me something I can fucking\neat?”\nRedemption\nH\nis Highness Crown Prince Orso would, no doubt, have considered these\nconditions intolerable.

It had a bed, a\ntable, a chair. The window was more of a barred slot, but at least it let him\nfeel the sun on his face in the mornings. The food was passable, the\ntemperature comfortable, the odour not oppressive. The guards, clad in the\ndark uniform of Angland, did not speak to him with scorn. They did not\nspeak to him at all. In most respects, it was very much preferable to the\ndamp cellar in which Judge had kept him. When it came to ways out,\nhowever, it was much the same.\nThere weren’t any.\nOrso issued a heavy sigh. Sighing was one of his few remaining hobbies\nand, with all the recent practice, he flattered himself to think he had become\nquite accomplished.

If the\nGreat Change had proved anything, it was that—with enough force, with\nenough fear—one could bend them into whatever knots one pleased.\nBrock had the men and the weapons. He had anyone loyal to Orso\nlocked up along with him. He had the lords firmly on his side, and had no\ndoubt gathered a pliant rump of Representatives around them. Anyone\nlikely to oppose him was weeded out as a traitor, the rest falling over\nthemselves to disinherit Orso and bow down before their new infant king,\nson of a bastard or no.\nOrso served up another sigh.

He came weighed down with compromises, enmities,\ndisappointments. Baby Harod carried no baggage. He was all rosy cheeks,\nfresh starts and limitless potential.\nOrso shuffled a couple of dead flies across his windowsill with the side\nof his hand. It would be done discreetly, he imagined. A midnight garotte?\nA quiet three-man knifing? Poison, perhaps, in his water? When Brock had\ntightened his grip sufficiently. When he had done the deals, arranged the\nbribes, won over everyone he could and silenced the rest, and brought some\nsemblance of longed-for peace back to Adua. With Savine to help him it\nwould not take long. No one drove a harder bargain than she, after all.\nHe heard bolts rattle and turned to face the opening door with as much\ndignity as he could muster.\nAnd there she was, in the doorway.\nShe had given up on wigs. Her dark hair was clipped short, the way it\nhad been at the trial, showing the scar on her forehead, the fading marks of\nher fight with Judge. It made her look both oddly vulnerable and oddly\npowerful at once. White was her colour now, but today’s dress was a very\ndifferent affair from the one she had worn at her trial, pearls and silver\nthread glittering as she moved with even more than her usual poise.\nShe looked like a queen. As much as Orso’s mother ever had."

I fumble for the proper\nterm of address…”\n“Your Highness,” she said, simply.\n“Most becoming. I’m not sure how one refers to a deposed king. Am I\ndeposed? Or retired? Or simply… unmentionable?”\n“They have been discussing that question. In the Hall of Mirrors.”\n“I suppose the Lords’ Round is a little burned to the ground. But where\nare my manners?” He pulled out the one chair, rubbed the flaking seat with\nhis cuff. “Might I enquire as to the purpose of your visit? A last word,\nperhaps, with the condemned?”\n“That…” She held his eye. “And to let you go.”\nIt took a moment for Orso to work that one through. “That and to…\nwhat now?”\n“We haven’t much time. My husband means to have you killed.”\n“The surprise is not so much that he might… as that you might not.”\n“You came to help me in Valbeck, when I scarcely deserved it. Then you\nhad mercy on me after Stoffenbeck, when I definitely did not. Then, to rub\nit in, you saved my life on the Tower of Chains. Without you, I would be\ndead three times over.”\nOrso waved it away. “I rather wish I had hanged your husband now, but\nin your case, I have no regrets. I would have felt awful about killing a lover\nor a sister, so killing both at once would have been impossible to live with.”\n“Selfish decisions, then.”\n“Ask any of my enemies. I’m the most selfish man in the Circle of the\nWorld.”\n“I suppose we can do good things for bad reasons.”\n“Or bad things for good ones,” he answered.\n“Or bad things for good ones.” She stepped out of the way of the door\nand someone slipped around the frame. A ragged man with bright eyes and\na moustache.\n“Tunny?” breathed Orso. He was followed by a girl in a soldier’s cap, a\nbig man at her back, sliding heavy swords into his belt. “Hildi? Gorst, by\nthe Fates!” Orso used to be thoroughly dismayed at the sight of his father’s\nbodyguard. Now he seized his hand and pumped it like an old friend’s,\nmuch missed.\nVick dan Teufel peered in from the corridor outside, her nose more bent\nthan it used to be and a few multicoloured bruises still lingering around her\neyes. “You have to go,” she said. “Now.”\n“A daring escape?” Orso raised his hands at the barren cell and let them\nfall. “I am packed.”\n“There’s a way ready through the sewers.” Teufel tossed a ring of keys\nto Tunny and he plucked them rattling out of the air. “But the city’s\ncrawling with the Lord Regent’s men. Won’t be easy getting out.”"

Ask any of my creditors. I pay my\ndebts.”\nHe wanted to take her in his arms. Fates help him, he wanted to kiss her,\nand not stop there. He knew she was his sister. Half-sister, anyway. He had\nnever doubted it was true. But it did not feel true. He was as much in love\nwith her as he had ever been. More, if anything.\nBut love is not always a solution. In this case, it was very much a\nproblem.\n“Goodbye,” he said. What else was there to say?\nIt was Jurand who appeared in the doorway first, staring into the cell with\nits bed, chair, table and instantly obvious lack of an imprisoned king.\nHe gave Savine a pained look. “What did you do?”\n“What did you do, Your Highness,” corrected Savine, slipping the little\nbox from her sleeve and taking a pinch of pearl dust up each nostril, feeling\nthat invigorating burn, then that reassuring numbness spreading through her\nface to the back of her throat.\nOne generally heard Leo coming before one saw him. The click of his\ncane, the scrape of his metal foot, the slight squeak of the mechanism at the\nankle. He really needed to get Curnsbick to apply a little oil. Jurand faded\nback to make room, started speaking softly to one of the other Anglanders.\n“You let him go.” Leo stared into the cell in disbelief. “You let him go?”\n“He let us go.” Savine calmly smoothed the front of her dress. “He let\nyou go.”\n“He let you go!” snarled Leo as he took one lurching step towards her.\n“He left me to rot with half my limbs in a stinking wagon!” He had lifted\nhis cane as if he might strike her with the handle. She resisted the urge to\nflinch, instead turned her cheek towards him as if inviting him to do it. The\nway he used to do to her. It felt like a long time ago.\n“He’ll be a thorn in our side for ever!” Leo got a grip, lowering his stick.\n“Where is he?”\n“Judge couldn’t get a thing out of me,” said Savine. “Do you really think\nyou will?”\n“Don’t be so bloody dramatic! You’re my wife. You’re the mother of my\nchildren. Of the real king, in fact! We’re on the same side.”\n“Really? I’m not so sure!”\nShe had raised her fist to shake it in his face and Leo noticed the rolled-\nup paper she was gripping. “What’s this?”\n“Nothing.”"

She tried to\ntwist free, dragging him off balance. He only stayed standing by clinging on\nto her, his dead weight almost pulling her over. He growled with effort as he\ntook another lurching step, iron ankle squeaking, pressing her against the\nwall, elbow of his useless arm jabbing into her corset as he made another\ngrab at her hand.\nWhat would people have thought, if they could have seen their new Lord\nand Lady Regent, the pilots of the nation, staggering about a prison cell,\nwrestling over a scrap of paper?\nShe felt a powerful urge to kick his iron leg away, bring him down, pin\nhis good arm and start punching. But that would have solved nothing. She\nlet him twist the document from her fist and leave her standing, flushed and\nbreathing hard. She let him think he had won. That was what he wanted,\nafter all. More than ever.\nHe pulled the paper open, eyes flickering over the writing. “What the\nhell’s this?”\n“A letter of charter,” said Jurand, plucking it from his fingers and\nhanding him his cane, every bit the faithful valet. The two of them were\nalways together these days. Hard to believe that Savine had needed to beg\nLeo to bring him back. “The Duke Rogont. A Styrian vessel.”\n“You’d hand him to the Styrians?” Leo looked at her in shocked\ndisappointment. “You’d make a weapon of him, for our enemies to use\nagainst us?”\nSavine drew herself up again. “I am starting to think your enemies and\nmine are not at all the same.”\n“We’ll discuss this later,” snapped Leo, turning his back on her. “Get\nmen to the docks!” And he limped out, tap, scrape, squeak.\nJurand gave Savine that pained look again. “What have you done, Your\nHighness?” And he followed Leo.\n“That’s it!” Glaward reined his horse in hard and swung from the saddle\nwith an ease that made Leo deeply jealous. “The Duke Rogont!”\nIt was an ugly tub, low in the water, a few scraps of gilt still clinging to\nthe unlikely bosom of its figurehead but her face reduced to a pitted mass\nby years of sea wind. She was about to get underway, men crawling in the\nrigging, a shabby-looking sailor dragging at the knots of a mooring line.\n“This ship is forbidden to leave the harbour!” roared Leo, gritting his\nteeth as he slithered from his saddle.\nThe sailor squeaked out a lot of scared-sounding Styrian as Glaward\nwrestled him down onto his face. More well-armed Anglanders were\nclattering up, dismounting, pulling out weapons.\nLeo limped down the long wharf, iron foot clonking on the boards,"

Find Orso! Bring him to me!”\nThey clattered towards the Duke Rogont’s gangplank, half-hidden\namong a mass of boxes and barrels. The leading man looked sideways, took\na whooping breath, then flew from the wharf and tumbled flailing into the\nsea. Leo winced as he skittered to an ungainly halt.\nSomeone had burst from among the crates and rammed the man with his\nshoulder. Now he turned towards Leo, blocking the narrow jetty with his\nbody. A very big body, with a noticeable lack of neck.\nBremer dan Gorst.\nThe king’s bodyguard pulled a final buckle tight on his unmarked\nbreastplate and stood, swords at his sides, a bright buckler on his left arm.\n“I am afraid I cannot allow it,” he said in that ridiculous squeak.\nLeo’s men crowded forward. At least a dozen of them, but there was no\nway around. Just that narrow path of crooked wood, and the sea on either\nside. Was there anyone in the Circle of the World you’d want to face less on\na wharf than Bremer dan Gorst?\n“What do we do?” muttered Glaward, licking his lips.\nLeo gave a frustrated growl. “I’ve nothing but respect for you as a\nswordsman! But we’re boarding that ship. In the name of King Harod, step\naside!”\nHe’d never seen Gorst smile before. He’d seemed a man incapable of\nexpressions. But he smiled now as he raised his steels, metal flashing in the\nsun. Like a man who feels a wonderful relief. “In the name of King Orso,”\nhe piped, his boots grinding into the weathered wood as he lowered himself\ninto a ready crouch, “no.”\n“So be it,” snarled Leo. “Kill—”\nGorst moved before he even said the him. One Anglander toppled into\nthe sea with his brains flying from his neatly split skull. Another sank to his\nknees, dropping his sword, trying to hold his guts in as Gorst ripped the\nshort steel back out of his stomach. The man began to scream. Desperate,\nwhooping screams.\n“Damn it,” muttered Leo.\nGorst was already back in his fighting crouch, eyes shifting calmly\nbetween the Anglanders.\nOne jumped forward, swinging, but Gorst slipped aside and let his\nsword thud into the wharf. Something gleamed on the back of the man’s\ndark uniform for an instant. The point of Gorst’s long steel as it ran him\nthrough. A moment later he folded up, keeled forwards like a tent that’s\nsuddenly had its guy-ropes cut. Gorst sprang at another Anglander with\nblinding speed. The man managed to parry the short steel but an instant\nlater the long chopped into his neck, beneath the rim of his helmet, and sent\nhim crashing into a pile of boxes, head flopping.\nGlaward swallowed. “Bloody hell.”"

You with the spears!” he shouted down the wharf. “Put him\nin the sea or in the ground!”\nTwo spearmen rushed forwards, points levelled. Gorst caught one on his\nbuckler and it scraped past. He smashed the face of the man who held it\nwith the pommel of his short steel and knocked him wailing into the water.\nHe growled as the other spear grated against his breastplate, opening a cut\nup the side of his head, but his heavy long steel was already swinging in a\ngreat overhead arc that caught the spearman in the shoulder and split him\nopen down to the chest with a meaty thud.\nBlood sprayed over Gorst, speckled his face, flooded across the wharf.\nMen stepped back in shock, opening a path. Flatbows clicked and rattled.\nOne man cried out as he was nailed in the back by a stray bolt. Another\nsank into Gorst’s meaty shoulder. A third bounced from his breastplate. A\nfourth caught him in the right arm, dangling from his sleeve. He whipped\nout of the way, behind some crates, as a fifth buried itself in the wood.\nThe man who’d been carved almost in half flopped down, legs still\nkicking weakly at the timbers.\n“You’re shot, Gorst!” yelled Leo. “You can’t stop all of us! And the\ndamn boat’s not leaving anyway. Give up now!”\n“Tell your mother…” came that high warble. “That I always held her…\nin high esteem.”\nLeo ground his teeth. “As if she’d care a shit. Load your bows. You lot,\nget down there and finish him!”\nNo one seemed very keen. The wharf looked like a busy day at the\nslaughterhouse. They edged forwards through the mess of blood and broken\nbodies.\n“Help me,” the one with a handful of his own guts was whimpering.\n“Help me.”\n“Throw down your arms!” shouted one of the Anglanders.\nIt seemed Gorst preferred to go down fighting.\nHe burst from behind the crates in spite of the bolts stuck in him. He\nslashed one man’s throat with his short steel in a spray of blood, left his\nlong steel rammed through another’s chest, kicked a third tumbling into the\nwater, shouldered a fourth out of his way and, with a high bellow, came\npounding down the wharf, head lowered, arms pumping, short steel held\noverhand like a dagger.\n“By the dead,” muttered Leo, dropping his cane and fumbling for his\nsword.\nPlanks rattled under Gorst’s boots. A flatbow bolt pinged off his\nbreastplate. Another sank into the same shoulder he was already stuck in.\nHe barely noticed, coming on faster and faster, twisted face speckled red,\neyes fixed on Leo under his furiously wrinkled brows, short steel going up\nhigh.\nLeo took one lurching step back, raising his sword, no idea how he’d\nhave met that charge even with all his limbs."

He lost all momentum.\nHe took one more wobbly step forward, but with no venom. His eyes\nhad gone soft, slightly crossed.\nAnother flatbow bolt nailed him through the thigh. As his foot came\ndown, the knee buckled and he toppled sideways, crashed drunkenly into a\nbarrel and came to rest with his bolt-stuck right arm over it, one leg out in\nfront, the other bent underneath him, his bloody short steel wedged\nharmlessly between two boards of the wharf beside his limp left hand.\nLeo let out a long breath and slowly lowered his sword. “Get aboard,”\nhe grunted at Glaward. “Find Orso.”\nThere was a red stain across Gorst’s eye above the flatbow bolt. But the\nother one rolled up towards Leo. It seemed, somehow, he still had that\nsmile.\n“Do you believe…” His voice sounded much like anyone else’s,\nwhispering. “In redemption?”\n“I don’t fucking care.”\n“You’re young. Give it time.”\nLeo groped for a cutting reply, but banter had never really been his\nthing, and certainly it had never been Gorst’s. Besides, the old swordsman\nwasn’t moving. His eyes were glassy. Words would’ve been wasted breath.\nThey usually were.\n“Fucking pointless,” hissed Leo, kicking Gorst’s short steel skittering\ninto the sea with a swing of his iron leg. There’d been a time when he’d\nadmired that man more than anyone. When he’d wanted to be just like him.\n“Goes to show,” he grunted, “you have to be your own hero.” He limped on\ntowards the gangplank, past the corpses and the sobbing man still trying to\nhold his guts in.\n“Well?” he shouted as Glaward stuck his head over the ship’s rail.\n“The captain says he’s got no passengers and his ship hasn’t been\nchartered. Not by the Lady Regent. Not by anyone. A cargo of cloth and\nbuttons bound for Westport, that’s all.”\n“By the dead. Rip this fucking boat apart!

If\nhe’d thought for a moment, he’d have realised it was very unlike Savine to\nwave so obvious a clue right under his nose. It seemed he could still be\nreckless, offered the right bait.\n“The charter was a fake. This was a distraction.” It took Leo an\nembarrassingly long time to sheathe his sword with only one hand, fishing\naround with the point for the mouth of the scabbard and near stabbing\nhimself in the hip. “Savine bloody tricked us!” He finally slapped it back"

I want every ship, cart and person\nin or out of the city searched and—”\n“I gave the orders as soon as we found Orso wasn’t in his cell,” said\nJurand. “There’s a company at every gate, Arnault’s Wall and Casamir’s.\nOthers out combing the streets. A rat won’t leave Adua without us\nknowing.”\nLeo closed his eyes and gave a sigh of relief. He would’ve hugged\nJurand if he’d had the limbs to do it. What madness had made him send\naway his best friend? “What the bloody hell would I do without you?” he\nasked.\nThe hooves of the blinkered old boathorse clopped sleepily on the towpath.\nThe water slapped gently against the sides of the barge. A breeze sighed\npeacefully down the canal, wafting away the worst of the vapours. From\ntime to time, the bargemen would make some growling utterance to\nlabourers, or washerwomen, or ragged children on the banks. Orso could\nnot understand a word. His own subjects, in theory, and it seemed they\nspoke a different tongue.\nTunny had lit a pipe, shoved it among his unkempt grey whiskers and\nwas calmly puffing away. Hildi had pulled her cap down low and set her\nmouth hard, glancing inconspicuously about and looking every bit a river\nrat born at the prow of a barge.\n“Can’t we go any faster?” murmured Orso. When he’d fantasised about\nescape it had been thundering from the city among fluttering flatbow bolts\non the back of a black charger, hair ripped by the wind of his daring. Not\nhiding in a greasy coal-heap and floating to safety at a snail’s pace. But\nthere was the difference between fantasy and reality, he supposed. A gulf he\nshould have been familiar with by now.\n“Slow and steady, Your Majesty” said Tunny around his pipe, very\nsoftly.\n“You rather assume I am still a king.”\n“It’ll take more than a room full of arseholes dropping a crown on a\nbaby to change my mind on that score.”\n“Or mine,” added Hildi, clambering to the edge of the hold and\nswinging her legs down.\n“What would I do without you?” Orso watched the stained sheds of\nwarehouses and manufactories slide by. “I hope Gorst got away.”\n“He wasn’t planning to,” said Tunny.\n“What?”\n“All he wanted was to hold Brock and his bastards up long enough for\nyou to get away.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“That he hoped to trade his life for yours, and considering his skills with\na sword, I expect he’ll have succeeded.”\nOrso stared off at nothing. “I never did a thing to deserve loyalty like\nthat.”\n“Sometimes loyalty’s an excuse for something else,” said Tunny, eyes\nfixed far off. “This is the way he always wanted it, I reckon.”"

You can honour his sacrifice by making sure it doesn’t go to waste.”\n“When the hell did you get so profound?” asked Orso.\n“I’ve always been a fount of wisdom.” And she hopped back up on the\nbarge’s roof, tucking a stray yellow curl out of sight inside her cap. “But\nyou’ve been too self-absorbed to notice.”\n“Sounds like me,” murmured Orso.\nTunny slipped out a battered flask and took a nip. “So where now?”\nOrso had never expected to leave the Agriont again. Not alive, anyway.\nNow he started to see that escape might be far from the end of his problems.\nIndeed, it might scarcely be the beginning. He had to find somewhere he\ncould hide, he supposed. Somewhere he could rebuild, gather his forces.\nSomewhere he could set about a plan to reclaim his throne. That was what\ndeposed kings were supposed to do, wasn’t it? Even if they never wanted\nthe damn thing to begin with? Even if it meant they’d bring trouble\nwherever they went? Trouble for themselves, trouble for their subjects,\ntrouble for anyone who helped them…\nOrso retreated into his tarp, working his back against the coal. He could\nnot help wondering about a world in which he simply… let it go. Folded his\nhand and let the Young Lion have it all. Found some unregarded corner in\nwhich to live in harmless obscurity. No more fighting. No more deaths on\nhis account. No more crushing responsibilities.\nHe was starting to smile. “You know, I think—”\nBut Tunny was frowning up at Hildi. “What is it?”\nShe had stood tall to get a better view. “Boats up ahead,” she muttered, a\nwarning note in her voice.\n“It is a canal.”\n“But they’re not moving.”\nOrso felt that familiar sinking as he peeked over the prow. He could see\nCasamir’s Wall ahead, through the furnace murk. Boats and barges, backed\nup in a queue, horses idle on the towpath. Were there men up near the black\nopening of the tunnel that led out of the city? Dark-uniformed men on both\nsides of the water and crawling over the frontmost boat?\nThe handler was already pulling up his horse, one of the boatmen\njumping to the bank with a rope and looping it around a strapping post,\nleaning back hard to bring them to a creaking stop.\n“What’s to do?” called Tunny at an old coal-smudged fellow in the barge\nahead.\n“They’re searching every boat out o’ the city.”\n“For what?”\n“Damned if I know.” The man spat over the side into the water. “Bloody\nAnglanders, they’re worse’n the bloody Burners were.”\n“And a lot more organised.” Tunny hopped from the barge onto the"

Something to take\nthe hard edges off the world. To blur the memories of the things done. But\nhe’d promised no trouble.

But\nwhen she smiled, it still lit the gloomy world, the way it always had.\n“Gunnar?” she said.\nAnd he just started crying. A jolting sob first, that came all the way from\nhis stomach. Then there was no stopping it. He fumbled his lenses off and\nall the tears he hadn’t shed the last six months came burning down his\ncrushed-up face.\nLiddy stepped forwards and he shrank away, hunched and hurting, arms\nup as if to fend her off. Like she was made of paper and might crumple in\nhis hands. She caught him even so. Thin arms but a hold he couldn’t break,\nand though she was a head shorter than him, she held his face against her\nchest, and kissed his head, and whispered, “Shhhh, now. Shhhhh.”\nAfter a while, when his sobs started to calm, she put her hands on his\ncheeks and lifted his head so she was looking straight up at him, calm and\nserious. She wiped the tears from his face and traced the healing scratches\nwith her thumbtip.\n“It was bad, then, was it?” she asked him.\n“Aye,” he croaked out. “It was bad.”\nShe smiled. That smile that lit up the world. Close enough that even\nwithout his lenses he could actually see it. “But I’m home now.”\n“Aye. You’re home now.” And he set to crying again.\nThe thump of May’s ledger opening made Broad flinch. Made him think of\nJudge’s hammer as she passed the sentence. He told himself she was dead.\nTold himself she’d be the last one ever thrown from the Tower of Chains.\nThey were filling the moat again, the water risen higher and the stains in the\nbottom covered deeper every day. The Court of the People was burned\ndown to charred rubble. He’d seen it. Wasn’t sure he really believed it,\nthough. Kept expecting to hear Judge bark at him to drag some fool out,\nbeat some fool down, make some bloody example. Kept expecting to hear\nher say, You’re mine.\nHe tried to hide it under a joke, peered over May’s shoulder at the neat\ncolumns of numbers he was nowhere near understanding.\n“I still say adding up debts is no way to make a living.”\nShe looked up from her book and smiled, and he smiled that he could\nmake her smile, and wondered that someone who’d done all the bad he’d\ndone could’ve had a hand in making something as good as she was. When\nhe left them in Angland she’d been sharp, gangly, all shoulders and elbows.\nHer hair had grown now, and her face fleshed out. She looked like a\nwoman, old enough to have children of her own.\n“Money’s where the money is, Da. Well… that and labour relations.”"

Well… that and labour relations.”\nShe said the words with this knowing twist to her grin that made Broad go\ncold.\nHis voice came out a croak. “How d’you mean?”\n“Da. I’m not a child any more. Ma might have a blind spot when it\ncomes to you, always wanting to believe the best, but I know where your\ntalents lie.” She put her hand over his, sitting limp now, on her shoulder,\nand patted the tattoo on the back of it. “I know how much Lady Savine’s\npaid you. I can make a guess what you do for it.”\nHe pulled his hand away, worked it up into his cuff as far as he could.\nFine cloth, it was made of, but he could still see the stars on his scarred\nknuckles.\nMay licked her pencil and turned back to her book, all matter-of-fact, as\nif beatings, threats and blackmail were just a trade like any other. “And why\nshouldn’t you be paid what you’re worth? Everyone else takes what they\ncan get. Someone has to put this family first.”\n“What are you two talking about?” asked Liddy, coming out of the\nbedroom.\n“Just my parents’ quaint notions,” murmured May.\n“Well, there’s no shortage of work to be done. We’re servants to the\nLady Regent o’ the Union, now.” Liddy brushed down the front of the fine\ndress she was wearing, though it was spotless anyway. “Black Rikke’s on\nher way to Adua, and Lady Savine wants us looking after her while she’s\nhere.”\n“Just the circles we move in now,” said May.\n“Remember when we were living in a cellar?” Liddy smiled around their\nairy rooms. “It came out all right, Gunnar.”\nIt came out all right. Broad’s mouth felt dry. Wanted a drink so bad.\nHe’d been fixed on not saying anything, but now he felt he had to be honest,\nblurt it all out. Burn it down like the Lords’ Round so they could somehow\nstart fresh.\n“You might hear… some things. About… what I did.” He pulled his\nlenses off and pressed at the sore bridge of his nose. His hand was shaking.\n“I was in the Court of the People. And I wasn’t on the right side of it.” Their\nfaces were blurs. He could hardly see them. “You might hear some things…\nabout Judge. She—”\nLiddy gripped his hand. “I don’t want to know! Understand? You did\nwhat you had to, to get through it. That’s all you did. It’s in the past. Like\nValbeck. Like Styria. We’re together now. And all on the right side.” A blind\nspot, like May said. Wanting to believe the best. He owed her that much.\nBroad wiped his weak eyes on the back of his hand. “You’re right.”\nHooked his lenses back on. “You’re always right.” He forced out a teary\nsmile. “It was that letter the two of you wrote made all the difference.\nThat’s what saved me. That letter.”"

That letter.”\nLiddy frowned puzzled at May, and May looked back at her, and\nshrugged. “We didn’t write a letter. Wish we could’ve, but we’d no way to\nget one to you. And you know Ma, she’s not much of a writer.” She was\nalready busy in her book again, scratching out the numbers.\nA thumping knock at the door made Broad jump. He wanted to tell\nLiddy not to answer it. To leave them as they were, for a little longer. But\nshe was already on the way.\n“Your Highness,” she said as the door opened and Savine swept in. Zuri\nwas with her, watching Broad carefully with her black eyes, calm as\never, the familiar book under one arm, the familiar watch around her neck,\nthough she had a gold one now, rather than silver. Everyone moving\nupwards, it seemed. Those who hadn’t taken the long drop, anyway.\nSavine took Liddy by the hands like an old friend. “Whenever I see your\nface I am reminded afresh how very glad I am that you are here, Liddy.\nAlmost as glad as your husband is. There is no one left in Adua who knows\nwhat to do with a hem.”\nNo doubt because most of ’em were paste under the slowly filling moat\nof the Agriont. Liddy blushed, curtsied clumsily. “We can’t wait to serve\nYour Highness, of course. To be in the palace, it’s, well…”\n“Not what any of us were expecting. What are you about, May?”\n“Some of the accounts for your mines in Angland, Lady Savine.”\n“I swear you’ll own them yourself one day! Might I have a quick word\nwith Gunnar?”\n“’Course.” May took her ledger and went out. Liddy gave Broad an\nexcited glance in the doorway. Wondering what new reward they were\nabout to get, maybe. Then she was gone, too, pulling the door shut.\n“So.” Savine raised one brow at him as she lowered herself, gracefully\nas ever, into one of his new leather-covered chairs. “It must be lovely to\nhave the family back together—”\n“The letter you gave me,” he said. “Before the trial.”\n“Yes?”\n“The one you said May wrote.”\nShe looked almost impatient. “Yes?”\n“She didn’t.”\nSavine frowned over at Zuri, who had her big book open, as though to\nmake notes. Zuri gave the smallest shrug. “Gunnar,” said Savine, “if you\nthink I would balk at copying someone’s handwriting to save my own life,\nyou really don’t know me very well.”\nBroad had hoped she might say sorry. Had expected her to at least look\nguilty. But she shrugged it off like it was nothing. “Guess I thought you’d\nchanged.”\n“I like to think so. But I am still me. You needed a nudge in the right\ndirection. I gave you one. Now you are a hero.” Her eyes were very hard.\n“You could just as easily have ended up the villain.”"

Wasn’t as if he could deny it.\n“How is your shoulder?” she asked.\nHe winced as he worked his arm in a circle. “Mending, I reckon.”\n“Good. My husband refuses to move any soldiers out of Adua, whether\nthey throttle the life from the city or not. Especially since the… king’s\nescape.” She took a long breath through her nose, and let it sigh away. “But\nwe cannot simply ignore the rest of the country. It grieves me to say that\nthere are still Breakers out there. They are determined to get in the way of\nthe reconstruction. Determined… to cause trouble.”\nBroad blinked at her. “I’m done with trouble,” he whispered. “I\npromised Liddy. I promised May—”\n“Must you? Really? I need you to gather some useful men and go to\nValbeck.”\n“To Valbeck?”\n“Yes.”\n“To the Breakers.”\n“Yes.” Savine’s eyes grew harder yet. “Break them.”\nBroad swallowed. “But… Liddy and May, they just got here.” A pathetic\nwhine of an excuse. Like saying he couldn’t murder anyone today ’cause he\nhad to trim his fingernails.\nZuri checked her watch. “It does not have to be now.” And she gave\nSavine the hint of a nod.\nSavine stood. “Tomorrow will be fine.”\n“Tomorrow,” croaked Broad.\n“Tomorrow early. I am still me, Gunnar. And you are still you. Go to\nValbeck and do what you do. If it helps, you can say I made you go. You\ncan pretend you would be happier here.” She leaned close to murmur. “But\nwe both know you wouldn’t be.”\nZuri made a note in her book, then raised her brows, slipped her pencil\nbehind her ear and followed the Lady Regent from the room.\nBroad stood a moment longer, skin prickling with horror. Or was it\nexcitement? Judge had the truth of it all along, maybe. Some men can’t help\nthemselves.\n“What did Her Highness want?” asked Liddy, slipping in.\n“To send me to Valbeck,” muttered Broad. “She says there’s trouble\nthere.”\nLiddy didn’t say anything. Neither did he.\nWhat was there to say?\nSo Many Changes\nR\nikke had to admit to feeling a bit unsteady as she shuffled from the ship\nto the quay. The Circle Sea had thrown a tantrum on the way and she’d\nspent the first day or two heaving over the side. Now solid ground was\nmaking her queasy. But she kept the smile on her face. That’s what being\nchief’s all about, her father would’ve said. Smiling while you want to puke.\n“Jurand!” She ignored his hand and gave him a hug instead. “Still…”\nShe waved a hand at him, trying to find the right words. “Juranding, then?”\nHe respectfully bowed his head. “I wouldn’t know how to do anything\nelse.”\n“But with more of…” And she flicked at the swags of gold braid\nfestooning his uniform. “All this.”"

Should it be\nLord Jurand, then?”\n“Not to an old friend. I’m hardly the only one advanced in the world,\nafter all.” Jurand looked towards the strange and varied peoples of the\nNorth clambering from the ship to stand gawping at the vast scale, crawling\nactivity and choking smokiness of everything. Quite the entourage. Which\nwas, of course, the idea. Merchants of Uffrith and Carleon, dressed in their\nbest dyed cloth and keen to talk business. Named Men in feast-day cloaks.\nChieftains of the High Valleys and the West Valleys and all the valleys in\nbetween. Hillmen and hillwomen, too, faces blue with tattoos. “Should it be\nQueen Rikke?”\n“By the dead, no! Black Rikke will do.” She glanced at the soldiers on\nthe quay, stiff and polished in big, dark uniforms on big, dark horses under\nbig, dark banners. Must’ve been a hundred of ’em at the least. “Quite the\nwelcome you’ve laid on.”\n“The Lord Regent insisted we take no chances with your safety,” said\nJurand, leading them across to a set of spare horses.\n“Touched,” said Rikke. “I never feel so safe as when I’m surrounded by\nheavily armed strangers.” Took her a moment to mount up, as she wasn’t\nmuch happier on a horse than a ship. “Must confess I was a smidge worried\nLeo and Savine might not be all that pleased to see me.” Rikke nudged her\nmount close to Jurand and murmured out of the corner of her mouth. “I did\nbetray ’em, after all. Just a bit.”\n“Lady Savine has always had a cool head.”\n“She could freeze milk with a whisper, that one.”\n“And you’ll find Leo’s not so easily carried away as he used to be.”\n“So all’s forgiven?”\nJurand’s smile didn’t totally convince. “They both want to look to the\nfuture.”\nIt wasn’t lost on Rikke that he’d come nowhere near answering the\nquestion.\nThe chimneys still puffed away, leaving a great grey stain across the sky.\nThe streets still thronged with folk of every shape and size, cut and colour.\nThat tower they called the House of the Maker still stuck up into the fog\nlike a giant’s finger. The stones still throbbed with that endless unquiet, the\nsnore of some slumbering demon, the rumble of unhappy men and\nmachines.\nBut not everything was the same. They’d always liked a flag in the\nUnion but since her last visit they’d gone mad with them. Buildings with\ngreat banners down the front. Suns painted twenty strides high on the sides\nof warehouses. Crossed hammers of Angland, too, with Leo’s golden lion."

Crossed hammers of Angland, too, with Leo’s golden lion.\nThere were armed men at every gate and corner. King’s Own in red, but\nalways shadowed by dark-clothed Anglanders. Rikke saw barricades down\nside streets, folk queueing up to be searched, soldiers rooting through\nwagons, flatbowmen frowning down from roofs.\n“Reckon there’s more soldiers of Angland here than there were in the\narmy of Angland,” murmured Rikke.\nShivers rubbed thoughtfully at his grey stubble. “Feels more like a city\nfallen to a siege than one delivered.”\n“Don’t trust a one o’ these bastards,” whispered Isern-i-Phail, in\nNorthern, frowning over her shoulder at their escort.\n“Aye, but you hate everyone,” said Rikke.\nIsern looked shocked to her roots. “Lies! I am all yielding fellowship\nand good humour! I like Shivers.”\n“Everyone likes me,” droned the most feared man in the North, swaying\nin his saddle.\n“And I’m fond of old Hardbread. And the Nail is a man I could be\npersuaded to hammer, d’you take my meaning?”\n“Despite the many layers of cunning I believe I’ve dug it out,” said\nRikke.\n“I’m taking to that girl Sholla. She surely can slice cheese fine.”\n“Like cobwebs.”\n“Just melts on your tongue. I’ve been thinking about all the other things\nshe might be able to slice and coming on all aquiver at the prospect.”\n“High praise.”\n“Hmmm.” Isern stuck out her lips, clearly sorting through the rest of her\nacquaintance and finding no treasure. “Hardly an army of friends, now I\nreckon ’em up.”\nRikke cleared her throat, pointing a hopeful thumb towards herself.\n“Meh.” Isern scrunched up her face like she’d taken a sup of old ale and\nhad a fear it was off. “On you I remain to be convinced.”\n“You said that two bloody years ago!”\n“And you’re shifting me in the right direction. Love easily given isn’t\nworth a thing, d’you see. Another few years and I might like you as much as\nmy brothers.” She twisted in her saddle to look at Scofen and Scenn, gazing\nabout at the great soot-streaked buildings in amazement.\n“So… you’ll ignore me most o’ the time, and the rest treat me with open\nscorn?”\n“That’s it!” And Isern clapped Rikke on the shoulder hard enough she\nhad to clutch at her saddle to stay in it.\nThey passed blackened scars through the city. Whole streets in ruins.\nBurned-out shells being torn down but some carcasses still standing, too,\ndoors and windows gaping like corpse mouths, breeze whipping stinging\nash from inside. There were more beggars on the streets even than there\nused to be. More homeless and helpless, slinking away as their great\ncompany clattered past.\n“By the dead,” breathed Rikke, staring at a great set of marble steps with\nnothing on top but the stumps of huge pillars, workmen battering away at"

Seemed even that could be laid low.\n“What’re they putting in its place?” asked Rikke.\n“I understand there is an urgent need for loans and investment. For new\nbusiness and construction. The Lady Regent has plans… to build the\nworld’s largest bank.”\nThey finally reined in outside a huge house among other huge houses, in\na part of the city where the air was cleaner and the sun shone brighter.\nRikke had to admit she was a little relieved. Wouldn’t have surprised her if\nthey’d been led in state all the way to the House of Questions and straight\ninto a cell.\n“Savine’s house,” she said, looking up at all those windows. “Looks like\nevery leaf in the garden got polished by hand.”\n“I wouldn’t be surprised,” said Jurand. “She used to live here. Then it\nwas an orphanage for a while, but it became too full, and the children have\nbeen moved to new lodgings. Now it’s yours.”\n“What?”\n“As long as you’re in the city.” He swung down easily from the saddle.\n“Black Rikke must have rooms fit for her station.”\nThe hall alone was big as a chieftan’s audience chamber and a lot finer\nfurnished. Two well-turned-out women were waiting there, one older, one\nyounger, with a dark-skinned fellow wide as a door. They looked a bit\nshocked at Rikke’s face, for which she hardly blamed them; she still jumped\nherself whenever she passed a mirror. They looked more shocked as Shivers\nloomed up behind her, then very shocked indeed as the fur- and mail-clad\nNamed Men and the tattooed hillfolk and some great tall woman who ran\nYaws these days crowded into the hallway tramping muck across the\nspotless tiles.\nThe older woman gave a doubtful curtsy. “Your, er—”\n“Just Black Rikke will do,” said Rikke.\n“I’m Liddy, this is May and this is Haroon.”\n“An honour,” said the dark-skinned man in the deepest voice you ever\nheard, bowing low.\n“Likewise,” said Rikke, bowing back. Since half of her people couldn’t\neven speak the language, that set everyone off bowing to everyone else.\nQuite the sea of bobbing heads.\n“The Lady Regent sent us in case there was anything you wanted,” said\nLiddy. “There’s a function planned at the Agriont tomorrow evening—”\n“Function?” Isern bit at the unfamiliar word. “Isn’t that, like, having a\nshit?”\nShivers rolled the eye he still had. “It’s folk drinking and dancing and\nlying to each other. They pretend it’s for fun but really it’s for whoever’s\ngot the power to show how much power they’ve got.”"

Last time I went to the Agriont I looked a fucking dunce.”\nRikke shrugged the red cloak from her shoulders and ran that fine cloth\nhissing through her fingers. “Reckon we’ve got some work ahead of us.”\nGood Times\nS\nince the weather was finally warming after the bitter freeze and the\nbloody thaw, Savine had been keen to throw open the doors of the palace\nand hold a reception in the budding gardens. Spring, and a new beginning,\nand a sorely needed opportunity to heal wounds: wounds of the Great\nChange still far from scarred over, and wounds inflicted since still bleeding.\nBut the evening was not so balmy as she had hoped, and the gooseflesh\non her bare arms made her think of the brutal winter just past. The braying\nlaughter of someone drunk too soon brought back the rioters’ clamour in the\nSquare of Marshals. The glint of torches on the armour of the many guards\nreminded her of the flames towering into the sky above the Court of the\nPeople. She wanted to run for her chambers, lock every door and hold her\nchildren close, but she had hidden too long. So she squared her shoulders,\nsnapped her fingers at Zuri to pass the box and took another pinch of pearl\ndust instead.\nSavine was far from the only one on edge. Her guests were those lucky,\nclever or treacherous enough to have lived through the fury of the mobs, the\nchaos of Risinau, the massacres of Judge. Now, after the briefest period of\nheady relief, they were starting to wonder if they might end up purged by\ntheir new Lord Regent.\nLeo was in no mood to heal wounds. He stood grim and aloof, as usual,\nsurrounded by armed Anglanders, as usual, refusing to sit down, as usual.\nHe had taken Adua in a vice-like grip the day Judge fell, but since Orso’s\nescape, and with Jurand to help, he had instigated a crackdown far harsher\nthan any the Burners had dreamed of.\nThe endless restrictions and searches, curfews and tests of loyalty were\nbad for morale and terrible for business.

Leo insisted\nhe was infusing Adua with common purpose, oblivious to the fact that\nnothing proclaims disunity like shrill proclamations of unity on every\ncorner.\n“My lords and ladies!” The panicky chatter subsided, every eye turning\ntowards the gateway in the palace wall, flanked by two giant sun banners.\nThe announcer puffed himself up with a mighty breath. “Might I present…”\nHe glanced nervously towards Leo then, as if embarrassed by the lack of a\nsuitably magnificent string of titles, deflated. “Black Rikke.”\nSavine knew how to make an entrance. She had engineered some\nclassics in her time. Starting new trends at the Solar Society. Radiantly\nhappy at her wedding. Proudly defiant at her trial. But she was not sure that\nshe ever made an entrance like Rikke did that day.\n“Someone has been to the tailor,” murmured Zuri.\nThe new mistress of the North was a heady concoction of high fashion,\nblack magic and barbaric splendour with a weird twist all her own. Her\ndress was of fine red Suljuk silk, long and lean like a streak of blood with a\ncloud of white fur about the shoulders. Her hair was bound up into a\nridiculously tall, impossibly shiny black gentleman’s hat, cocked right over\nin the manner of a backstreet pimp. She showed every one of those fine\nteeth in a knowing smile, the emeralds that Savine once gave her shining at\nher throat but her eyes shining brighter, one all white, the other all gaping\npupil in the centre of those tattooed witch’s rings. She raised her sinewy\narms and spread them wide, Sipanese lace gloves on her hands but chains,\nrunes and bone bangles dangling from her wrists.\n“Greetings from the North!” she screeched, and a strange entourage\nspilled through the gate and into the heart of the Union. At Rikke’s right\nshoulder came Isern-i-Phail, dressed like a duchess but walking like a\ndocker, necklace of fingerbones around her neck and the toes of her heavy\nboots peeping under the lace hem of her skirt. Caul Shivers was on her left,\noddly at ease in a braid-heavy general’s uniform paired with a savage-\nlooking broadsword, metal eye glinting behind his hanging grey hair. There\nwere hillwomen whose faces were stained with swirling tattoos. There were\nwarriors whose faces were criss-crossed with scars. There were craftsmen\nof Carleon and ships’ captains of Uffrith, and all with odd specks and\nspatters of Union fashion: a crystal-knobbed cane, a machine-patterned\nshawl, a jewelled pocket watch. One hillman peered suavely through a\nmonocle as though he’d been born wearing one.\n“Savine!” And Rikke slipped between her outstretched hands and folded\nher in a hug. Savine could hardly remember the last time anyone held her\nthat way, and she found herself squeezing Rikke back, as if they truly were\nold friends, with no jealousies or rivalries or backstabbings behind them."

Magic was not a\nthing one could sensibly invest in, of course. But looking into the black\ndepths of the Long Eye she could not help wondering what Rikke might\nhave seen with it. What she might know that Savine could not guess.\n“Rikke. You are… a vision.”\n“Ha! Vision. Saying you look good would be like calling snow cold, but\nI swear you look better’n ever. Motherhood must agree with you. Mother of\nthe Nation, no less!”\n“None of us came through the Great Change quite the same.” Savine\nglanced over at Leo, his hard face a pale spot among all those splendid\nuniforms.\n“All both more and less than we were.” And Rikke swept a glass of wine\nfrom a passing tray, swallowed half at one gulp. “You remember my last\nvisit here?”\n“Chiselled into my memory.” Savine wondered how many people who\nhad laughed, and drunk, and danced in the Hall of Mirrors that night were\ndead now. Half? More? A chilly gust swept across the gardens and it was\nthe most she could do not to shiver.\n“Not my proudest moment,” Rikke was saying. “Played a pigeon at a\npeacock contest, got caught by the queen in her son’s bed, then shat myself\nat a parade. What’s become of Orso?”\nSavine tried not to sound strangled but did not entirely succeed. “No one\nknows.”\n“Careless, for a country to lose its king. But I hear you found another, so\nno harm done, eh?”\nApart from that to the stability of the Union, the prospects of Savine’s\nchildren, her own position and the state of her marriage, all of which she\nhad thrown into jeopardy by setting Orso free against all good judgement.\n“None that cannot be mended, I hope.”\n“You were kind to me, that evening. You give the best gifts.” Rikke\nhooked the emeralds around her neck and held them up to the light, then\npeered down at the runes Savine was wearing. The ones Rikke had given\nher in return. “And you even kept mine to you.”\n“Nothing else would have suited the occasion.”\n“Well, I won’t be swapping back, if that’s what you’re hoping.” And\nRikke flicked open a fan with a snap, started wafting herself as gracefully\nas any regular at the theatre. “Am I doing it right?” And she peered down\nher nose, setting a few strands of hair no doubt left loose for the purpose\nfluttering about her tattooed face.\n“I may have to come to you for lessons.”\n“Ha again! You were kind to me that night and you’re being kind now.\nYou’re a lot kinder than folk make out.”\n“I doubt everyone would say so.” Savine lowered her voice. “I did\nbetray you to Stour Nightfall, after all.”\n“I did betray you to King Orso. No doubt we both had our reasons."

No doubt we both had our reasons.\nDoesn’t mean we’re not friends.” And she grinned sideways. A grin with a\nhint of danger. “I mean, what’s the use of stabbing your enemies in the\nback?”\n“Those bastards you can stab in the front,” murmured Savine, taking a\nquick pinch of pearl dust. There was a time she would have hidden it, but\nwho would dare disapprove now? She offered the box to Rikke.\n“My governess in Ostenhorm once said that, when abroad, one should\nobserve the local customs.” Rikke drained her glass, then whipped off one\nof her gloves to take a hefty pinch, nudged the gold ring through her nose to\nthe side and noisily snorted it up. “By the dead.” She stuck her tongue out,\nblinking back tears. “That burns.”\n“It grows on you, believe me.”\nRikke held on to Savine’s arm as she stifled a sneeze, then pulled a little\nbrown pellet from her glove and held it out. “We can swap gifts this time,\ntoo.”\n“Chagga?” Savine took it from Rikke’s fingers and tucked it down\nbehind her lip, then could not help a shudder. “That tastes…” She could\nhardly find the words to describe its earthy bitterness.\nRikke chomped on a pellet of her own and winked. “It grows on you,\nbelieve me.”\nAll about the gardens people were swapping gifts and stories, forming\nstrange partnerships and embracing the unknown. Curnsbick was talking in\na mixture of broken Northern, shouted common and flamboyant gestures to\na set of merchant women swamped in furs. Something about chimneys,\nSavine thought. Probably they understood the details as well as she ever\nhad.\nSelest dan Heugen, meanwhile, giggled as she worked her own brand of\nmagic on the monocled hillman. “There’s copper in these mountains of\nyours?” Her nose twitching as if she could smell the profits, while his gaze\nstrayed so far it was a wonder his eye-lens didn’t drop down the front of her\ndress.\n“We have thousands counting on us now.” Savine watched Lord Isher\nand some long-bearded chieftain shake hands with immense dignity. “We\nmust look to the future.”\n“That’s what I’m all about. But what could we savages have to offer\ncivilisation?”\n“Civilisation just finished a round of slaughter to make the Bloody-Nine\nblush. The North has some remarkable natural advantages—”\n“You said the same about me, when I last came to Adua.”\n“And time has proved me more right even than I knew. When Leo and I\ntravelled across the North last year—”\n“To betray me to Stour.”\n“Exactly—before you betrayed us both—I saw vast forests ready to be\ngiven over to the saw. Great marshes ready to be drained and brought under\nthe plough. Hills rich with coal and iron scarcely mined. River after river\nsurging swiftly to the sea, begging to be channelled, dammed and harnessed\nby waterwheels.”\n“You saw opportunities.”"

The one she had always used to seal\ndeals. “For our mutual benefit. I do give the best gifts.” And she slid a\ngentle fingertip under the emeralds Rikke wore, weighed them a moment,\nthen laid them gently back against her skin. “But not only out of kindness. I\nfreely admit I greatly underestimated you.”\n“Oh, you didn’t come out of it too badly. Stour Nightfall did the same\nand he’s hosting no garden parties, I promise you.” From a few strides off\none would have taken it all for good-natured blather. But there was an edge\non Rikke’s every word. A conversation with her was a cake full of razors.\n“You proved yourself a cunning and resourceful enemy,” said Savine.\n“When I am lucky enough to find one of those, I do everything I can to turn\nthem into a friend.”\n“That’s nice to hear, from someone as cunning and resourceful as you.\nNothing would warm my heart more than your friendship, but… it’s not my\nheart that brought me here.” Rikke tipped up her chin, looking down her\nnose at Savine, then reached behind her head and nudged her hat forwards\nso the brim cast her eyes into shadow. “My head holds a worry… when it\ncomes to looking to the future…” That twinkling left eye slid over to Leo,\nfrowning at the festivities with grim detachment. “I’m talking to the wrong\nhalf of the marriage.”\nWhen Savine offered a gift, she was used to it being accepted. She never\noffered one until she was sure it would be. But she kept smiling in spite of\nher annoyance. “I and my husband have always had an equal partnership,”\nshe said.\n“Please.” And Rikke nudged Savine with a sharp elbow. “When you\ncame to visit me in Uffrith you had him saddled like a pony.” She beamed\naround at the gathering, showing every one of those fine teeth again. “Now\neveryone admires you. Envies you. Loves you. The Darling of the Slums!\nWhen they talk o’ you, your girls May and Liddy can’t find praise high\nenough.”\n“You are all far too kind,” said Savine.\n“But it’s not your soldiers on every street corner, is it?”\nAnd Rikke snapped her fan out between them and glided away, taking\nthe last word with her.\nFor now, at least.\nLeo felt a bit of an outsider at his own party."

It\nwas his home now, after all. He’d earned it. He’d won it. And it was full of\nNorthmen. The feel of the gardens was closer to the Dogman’s old hall in\nUffrith than the stuffy receptions of King Jezal’s reign.\nBut the blunt Northern accents and the bluff Northern laughter only\nmade him think of how he used to be. That fearless, generous, reckless\nyoung fool who could run all day and never tire, who could beat all his\nfriends with their choice of weapons, who stood not far from this spot after\nhe won a duel against Stour Nightfall, loved and admired by all. The Young\nLion! A hero with the world at his two good feet! By the dead, he missed\nthat man. He made the one hand that worked into a fist so tight the knuckles\nclicked. Felt the unpleasant tingling in the other as the fingers twitched in\nsympathy inside his jacket.\nHe watched Rikke strut away from Savine, both of them smiling like\nwarmer words were never said. His old lover and his new. Or two old\nlovers, maybe. Wasn’t much affection between him and the Lady Regent\nthese days. Since she helped Orso escape, any warm feelings were strictly\nfor the benefit of observers.\nIt reminded him of his parents’ marriage, towards the end. A lie it suited\neveryone to pretend was true, even years later. Maybe everyone follows in\ntheir parents’ footsteps, doomed to blunder into the same mistakes like a\nblind man into furniture. All our paths set before birth, inevitable, like\nCurnsbick’s useless fucking cart, only running on the rails it’s given. The\nonly choice you have is how fast you’ll roll to the end of the line. A\ndepressing thought. Leo was having a lot of those, lately.\nIt wasn’t as if he was left alone. The maggots kept coming, to smile,\nbow, flatter, always with that needy nervousness in their eyes, that oily fear\nin their voices, always trying to winkle something from him. It made him\nsick, their petty selfishness, their blinkered greed. He was covered from\nmorning till night in a grease of lies there was no scrubbing off. But that’s\nwhat you’re left with once you’ve led your real friends to their deaths.\nHe watched Jurand and Glaward talking to Rikke. The few survivors of\nthose carefree times, laughing together, without him, and he ground his\nfalse foot into the lawn until the stump of his leg ached. He’d been thinking\nabout sending Glaward away. Some foreign posting. So Leo wouldn’t have\nto look at his stupid face. So he’d have Jurand to himself. He’d won\neverything, and still he was endlessly angry, endlessly jealous. But then\nhe’d lost everything, too.\nHe took a sour slurp of wine, watching Rikke plough through the throng.\nShe didn’t work the crowd with Savine’s silky subtlety. She did it in a way\nall her own, with her big smile and her crazy eyes and that easy laughter"

She did it in a way\nall her own, with her big smile and her crazy eyes and that easy laughter\nand those wild gestures, wine sloshing from her glass as she threw up an\narm.\nHe could’ve limped over. It would’ve felt good to meet her halfway, to\nfind the honest smile he used to have around her. His face could still make\nthat shape, couldn’t it? But she’d betrayed him, so it would’ve been a kind\nof surrender. The Young Lion might’ve suffered defeats, but he’d never\nsurrendered. Never. Whatever it cost him.\nSo he stood there, patience wearing down, while Rikke chatted to Lord\nIsher. While she compared necklaces with Selest dan Heugen. While she\nfanned the hair combed over Dietam dan Kort’s head into fly-away wisps. It\nseemed as if she’d given every guest a compliment before she finally\nreached him, grinning as if there was no chasm full of broken promises\nyawning between them.\n“If it isn’t Black Rikke.” The Northern words felt good in his mouth, he\nhad to admit. “The beautiful and mysterious Witch of the North! You look\nwell.” She looked better than ever, in her own mad way. No doubt Antaup\nwould’ve been nudging and oohing and phwoaring at the sight of her even\nmore eagerly than he used to. Had Leo not got him killed.\n“If it isn’t little Leo, the biggest man in the Union.” Behind the regal\nbearing and the costume and the tattoos, did he catch a glimpse of that\nawkward girl he used to know? Used to love, even? The thought seemed to\nhurt, right in his chest. “We’ve come a long way, haven’t we?” She leaned\nclose, the smell of chagga on her warm breath bringing all those times\nthey’d lain together rushing back. “Since fucking in a stable.”\nHe felt himself blushing, the way his mother always made him blush\nwhen a conversation didn’t go her way. “Everyone had fun that night,” he\nsaid, stiff and unconvincing, “and everyone’s having fun now,” managing to\nsound bitter, too.\n“Not you,” said Rikke, watching him over the rim of her glass.\nThat flash of honesty might’ve shaken him from his gloom once. Now it\npushed him deeper. “Fun is for people with all their limbs,” he grunted.\nThe sun had fully set and the party was turning wild. The pent-up terror\nof the Great Change released, maybe. Isern-i-Phail had pulled her purple\nskirts right up to her crotch and was showing a scar on her muscular thigh\nto Zuri, who considered it with her black brows high. Shivers, general’s\njacket opened to his grizzled chest, was offering his drawn sword to\nGlaward, who looked like he might have cut his thumb on the edge as he\nstudied the silver mark near the hilt. By the dead, a hillman had\ncommandeered a violin and was sawing out a barely passable jig to gales of\nshrill laughter from a tipsy Isold dan Isher.\n“I’m sorry,” said Rikke softly. She wasn’t smiling any more. “Sorry I"

It hurts me, to see you hurt.\nCan’t blame you if you don’t believe it. Can’t blame you if you don’t care.\nBut I’m sorry.”\nLeo felt the sting of tears in his eyes. He hadn’t realised how badly he’d\nwanted to hear it. He wanted to say he was sorry, too. Take her hand. Kiss\nher cheek. Be her friend. The dead knew he needed one. The way they had\nbeen long ago, sitting up in the rafters of her father’s hall.\nBut those children were long gone. Leo hadn’t chosen to make himself\nfearsome, but that was what the times demanded. For the sake of the\ncountry, his family, his wife. Whether they thanked him or not. Softness\nnow was weakness. Weakness now was death. He could see no way back.\nA chill breeze whipped the feathers on the ladies’ hats, made the torch\nflames flash and flicker.\n“Sorry won’t bring my leg back, will it?” he snapped. “It won’t bring Jin\nback, or Antaup, or all the others who died that day.”\nShe glanced at him sharply from under the brim of her hat. “Really? All\nTricky Rikke’s fault? I didn’t make you turn rebel. I didn’t talk you into\nfighting a battle. I didn’t put the spur to your horse on the day.”\n“You sent a bloody letter to Orso, though!” He saw Jurand look over,\ntried to bring his voice down and failed. “I fought for you, I risked my life\nfor you, and you betrayed me!”\nHe’d been hoping for more guilt. Instead he got an angry snort. “What\nwas I supposed to do, laugh along while you sold Uffrith to Stour? See\neverything my father worked for—”\n“What?” snapped Leo.\nRikke narrowed her eyes, the tattoos on her forehead twisting as she\nfrowned. Somewhere in the distance there was a soft rumble of thunder.\n“Your wife stabbed me in the back the first chance she got. Bought the\nGreat Wolf’s help with my home.” Here was a part of the story Savine had\nconveniently left out. Leo stared over at his wife, standing beside the Great\nMachinist in her usual dazzling white, and found her looking back.\nStudying them. Trying to gauge what they might be saying, and how to turn\nit to her advantage. “You didn’t know that?” asked Rikke.\nLeo shut his eyes. By the dead, had he learned nothing? Of course he\nhadn’t persuaded Stour to follow him to the Union out of brotherly feeling.\nOf course Savine struck a deal. And of course she’d done it behind his back.\nRain had started spitting down, white streaks frozen in the torchlight.\nServants struggled with portable awnings as the wind picked up. A woman\nchased after a lost hat as it tumbled across the lawns.\n“No.” He bit off every word. “I did not know that.” He glowered over at\nSavine again, but she wasn’t even looking now.

Laughing gracefully at\nsome joke of Curnsbick’s, as if Leo’s pain didn’t matter a shit to her either\nway.\nSo she was as much to blame as anyone for Stoffenbeck. For everything\nhe’d lost there. More. Finding that Rikke had good reasons for turning on\nhim should’ve been the perfect chance to forgive her. But news of one more\nwounding betrayal by his wife didn’t sweeten Leo’s mood. They’d both\nstabbed him in the back while they stabbed each other in the face, yet\nsomehow they could glide away friends, ruling the gardens, loved by all,\nwhile he was left nursing unhealable wounds, hated and feared and alone.\n“Why did you come here, Rikke?” he snarled. “Dressed up like the\nfucking fortune-teller at an overpriced carnival?”\nHer jaw worked. “My father always said we should set our feuds aside,\nif we could. Told me one score settled only plants the seeds of two more. I\nwas hoping to put the past behind us and look to the future. Please, Leo.\nThere’s been enough blood shed between the North and the Union.”\nHe gave a joyless snort. “Oh, I could stand more bleeding from the right\nbodies.”\n“Your wife seemed minded to forgive, and I always reckoned her the\nruthless one.”\n“So did I. But apparently I’ve been wrong about a great many things.”\nBy the dead, what Leo really wanted was for her to put her arms around\nhim and hold him the way she’d held Savine. But somehow, without\nmeaning to, he’d made himself into a man no one wanted to touch. “It’s\ngood to see you again, Rikke. Really it is. I miss what we had. Really I do.”\n“You miss what you had,” she said, softly. “You miss what you were.”\n“If you like.” Another crackle of thunder, louder, nearer. The way the\ndamp banners rustled put Leo in mind of Red Hill, of Stour Nightfall’s\nstandard and his own, two young gods facing each other across the bridge.\nBut memories of past glories only made his fury cut deeper. “The truth is\nI’m a lot less forgiving than I was. The way I see it, you owe me.”\n“Owe you what? An arm and a leg?”\n“Something!” he hissed in her face. Glaward glanced worriedly over.\nCaul Shivers, too. Leo ignored them. “You owe me something, and I’ll\ncollect. If I have to march to Carleon and rip it from your hands!”\nShe didn’t back off. Not a step. There was a lot of her father in the\nstubborn set to her face, glittering specks of rain across the fur on her\nshoulders. “If you want war, the North’ll fight you. Fight you as one, you\ncan count on that.”\nAnger was safe. He knew where he stood with it. “Oh, Rikke.” It\nmight’ve been the first time he’d smiled that night. A hard smile, half a\nsnarl, lips curled back from his teeth. “You know how much I love a fight.”"

The\nonly sound they made, though, was the faint chattering of Hildi’s teeth.\nBrock had the city sealed as tightly as Valint and Balk’s famous vault.\nThey were hungry, cold, exhausted and entirely out of friends. A likely\nreward of thousands of marks for your capture really was a heavy load to\nplace on anyone’s loyalty. It was getting to the point where Orso was\nconsidering turning himself in if it meant he could afford a decent meal.\nThey all shrank back at the sound of clattering hooves, a gilded carriage\nwhirring through the wet night beyond the bushes in its own pool of light.\nOrso was sure he heard a drunken titter echoing from its open window.\n“Guests leaving the royal function,” he murmured, wistfully.\n“Wonder which of the perennial arse-lickers is in there,” grunted Hildi,\nwith a sour sniff. “That lying slime Heugen. That treacherous bastard\nIsher.”\n“Tongues neatly extracted from my rear and slipped between the Young\nLion’s scarred buttocks without so much as a blush, no doubt. They used to\nhuddle around me at those bloody events like geese at the trough.”\n“You miss it?” asked Tunny.\n“I don’t miss the sycophancy,” mused Orso, putting a hand to his\ngrowling stomach. “I do miss the food.”\n“And the clothes,” said Tunny.\n“And the roofs,” said Hildi, squinting up at the steadily pissing heavens.\n“And the not being hounded by bitter enemies with unlimited resources\nwho control every gate, wharf and corner.” Orso cringed into the shadows\nagain at the sound of tramping feet. Beyond the bushes, wet armour\ngleamed as yet another patrol came past. “Those were good times,” he\nwhispered.\nThere was a brief pause.\n“Admit it,” said Tunny, “you miss the sycophancy, too.”\n“Little bit, but, honestly? I was in a wretched state back then. I actually\nfeel much more cheerful starving out here in the rain.” Orso gave a\ndisbelieving chuckle.

He suspected they\nboth guessed the real reason he had to leave them. That their loyalty to him\nhad cost them enough already and it was time for him to repay the favour\nand take his own risks. He prised her fingers gently free. “What’s our tally\nat now?”\n“Two hundred and sixteen marks…” Hildi was pretending her eyes were\nwet from the rain and fooling no one. “And thirty bits.”\n“Sounds a touch high.”\n“I’m never wrong about numbers.”\n“She’s never wrong about numbers,” said Tunny.\n“No.” Orso wrapped his hands gently around her fist. “I am so, so sorry,\nHildi, but I think… for now… I’ll have to owe you.”\n“If they hurt you I’ll be revenged on the bastards!” she snarled at him,\nwet eyes suddenly blazing. “I swear!”\nOrso smiled, then. It was an effort, considering everything, but he\nmanaged it. “I appreciate the thought more than you can know, but… if\nanything happens to me… I’d really rather you let it go.” He laid a hand\ngently on Hildi’s wet cheek. “Have a life instead.

Quite an arm, far as\nshe could tell. Then she teetered across the slick cobbles towards the steps.\nBloody things wouldn’t stay still, wobbling about all over the place. Or was\nthat her?

Besides, a man who’s moved by grovelling\nwill never get enough grovelling for his taste. Let him once set his foot on\nyour back and you’ll have a fucking bootprint ’twixt your shoulder blades\ntill the day you’re buried.

His hair was a damp tangle, his face\nsmudged with dirt, his clothes stained and torn, but his grin was the same as\nwhen he’d brought her an egg in bed, and it looked better than ever.\n“Bloody fuck, Your Majesty,” said Orso.\n“Everyone’s calling ’emselves that these days,” muttered Rikke. “I hear\neven babies are doing it.”\n“Much to my dismay.”\n“You look…” She took a step or two into the room. Felt like she\ncouldn’t help it. “A touch less prosperous than last time we met.”\n“I can only apologise for my wretched appearance. I have been slightly\non the run the last few days.”\n“I’d have thought you’d be used to being pursued.”\n“Of course.

You look…”\n“Like the fucking fortune-teller at an overpriced carnival?”\nHis eyes moved over her dress, which was clinging somewhat from the\nrain, then up to her face. Her blind eye and her Long Eye. The black rings\npricked into the skin around it. “I was going to say beautiful and\nmysterious.”\n“Oh.” Rikke found she was tidying a damp strand of hair behind her ear\nand made herself stop. “Well. In that case, proceed.”\n“Don’t like this at all,” came Isern’s voice, in Northern. She was right at\nRikke’s shoulder, her tattooed arm and her pale tightly folded across her\npurple ball-dress and her narrowed eyes fixed suspiciously on Orso. “This is\ndangerous.”\n“Never mind that!” said Rikke, herding her towards the door. She was\nkeenly aware of how dangerous it was. Maybe that was the appeal. Maybe\nshe was a moth drawn to the flame and would very soon go up in a fireball.\n“You need to think about this, Rikke.” Isern caught the door frame,\nleaning close to growl under her breath, “Just don’t be thinking with your\nquim.”\n“Yes, yes, make of your quim a stone.” Rikke managed to bundle her out\ninto the hall, wrestled the door shut and leaned back against it with an over-\nwide grin.\nOrso was looking approvingly around the room, which was almost as\nbig as Skarling’s Hall and a damn sight more expensively furnished, with\nglittering vases and polished wood and candles twinkling in gilded holders.\n“So… you won.”\n“I did,” said Rikke, enjoying a little swagger about the tiles herself.\nNothing had been easily won, after all. Might as well enjoy it.\n“I lost,” said Orso, but without much rancour.\n“So I hear.”\nHe stood, took the stopper from the decanter with a pleasant clinking of\nglass. “The Queen of the Northmen!”\n“Just Black Rikke. If you’ve got the power you don’t need the title.”\n“I was always the other way around. So many titles. No power at all.”\nAnd Orso snapped out a little laugh and started pouring two glasses of\nwine. He looked even more carelessly at ease as the Union’s most wanted\noutlaw than he had as its crown prince. “Your friend Isern isn’t wrong. I’m\nafraid I’m…” And he looked up from under his brows with that smile that\nseemed to give her a sharper tickle every time. “Trouble.”\n“And you’re happy to tread trouble across my carpet?”\n“My old standard-bearer thought it was a bad idea but… no one would\nexpect me to come to you.”\n“I’ll confess I’m fucking astonished.” But the truth was Rikke was glad\nto see him, and not just because of the pearl dust and the drink.

And partly because he was\nhandsome, and funny, and charming, and the certain knowledge that he was\na very excellent lover was kissing constantly at the back of her pearl-dusted\nmind. She had to keep herself hidden, these days. Behind the tattoos and the\nknowing smiles and the stony heart. With him, she could let herself show.\n“I need someone to get me out of Adua,” he said. “Someone powerful.\nSomeone brave. Someone with a large entourage, in which an extra face,\nsuitably obscured, might go unnoticed. And you did write me that letter,\nafter all, so I wondered if you might still have some trifling attachment to\nmy lost cause?”\n“Mostly suited my own needs, if I’m honest. But it’s true I’ve always\nliked lost causes.”\n“There was… something else.” He paused, his grin curling wider, as if\nhe was casting his mind back to a happy memory. “That night we spent\ntogether. And that morning after. I’ve thought about it often.”\nShe couldn’t help smiling herself. “So have I.” In fact, she was thinking\nabout it right now, and she pulled one of those ridiculous lace gloves off\nwith her teeth. It was all out of shape from the damp anyway.\n“I’ve wondered, now and again, what might have happened… had we\nbeen different people.”\nShe licked her finger and thumb and started snuffing out candles, each\none dying with a little fizz and a curl of smoke. “So have I.” The room\ngradually grew dimmer, gradually felt hotter, in spite of the clammy fabric\nclinging to her, till there was only the gleam on the gold thread in the\ncurtains, on the silverware and the glassware, at the corners of Orso’s\nsmiling eyes.\n“And… well… we’re different people now,” he said.\n“No doubt. We’re all of us changed.” All the things seen since then. The\nthings done. The people gone back to the mud. He’d lost his throne, she’d\ngained one. But as she came close and took the glass from his hand, he had\nthat same look in his eyes he’d had that night. That look of unguarded\ndesire. And being looked at that way felt just as good. Better’n ever, maybe.\nShe knocked the wine off in one throw, then had to stand there wincing,\none hand pressed to her chest, fighting the urge to puke it back up. That\nwould’ve been quite the mood-killer.\n“Need a bucket?” he asked.\n“No, I think I’ve got it—” Fighting down an acrid little tickle at the back\nof her throat with a shudder. “Under control.” And she took her wet hat off\nand started to slide the pins from her hair, toss them on the table beside her\nso they bounced and clicked and tumbled twinkling on the floor.\nShe was a leader. She had responsibilities. Hard choices to make.\nBut they could wait till tomorrow.\n“Sometimes feels like life’s just a long preparation for something,” she\nsaid, and she put a finger on his chest and pushed him, so he had no choice\nbut to sit down, hard, wine slopping from his glass. “Hard work getting\neverything right for a perfect future.” And she scrubbed her damp hair with"

Nothing’s ever right. Not\nreally.”\n“Certainly not in my experience,” he whispered, slightly throaty, as she\nreached out and perched the hat slanted on his head.\n“And if it is, it turns wrong soon enough.” She took two fistfuls of her\ndamp dress and gathered it up. “It rots. It rusts. It dies.” Gathered it up all\nthe way to her thighs, goosefleshed from the cold outside and the warm\ninside. “Life’s naught but a set of moments.” And she slipped one knee onto\nthe cushions to either side of him, lowered herself gently into his lap.\n“You’ve got to live each one.”\n“I’ve always thought so,” he murmured, eyes fixed on hers.\n“All that time spent tending the garden,” she whispered. Seemed fine\nluck now she hadn’t bothered with all that mass of underwear they trussed\nthemselves up in down here. “You forget to sit back in the garden and enjoy\nit.” And she pushed her hands into his hair, cool and damp from the rain,\nand twisted his face up towards hers, and started to kiss him.\nOf Your Heart a Stone\nW\nhen Orso woke in a comfortable bed for the first time in months he\nwondered, for a blissful moment, whether it might all have been a dream.\nThe rebellion. The Great Change. The Court of the People. The baying\ncrowds and the prison cells. The figures dropping from the Tower of\nChains.\nThen he saw the sunlight glimmer from between the heavy drapes, the\nfaint glint on the gilded wallpaper, and it came back in a pleasurable rush\nwhose bed he was in. The smile spread across his face and he stretched,\nrolled, thinking he might politely offer Rikke the chance to make use of his\nmorning wood, the way she had so enthusiastically made use of the\nmidnight variety—\nBut the bed was empty.\nSomeone had left fresh clothes on a chair and he slipped from the covers\nand pulled the trousers on. He crept to the window, nudged the curtains\nback with a cautious finger to peer across gardens glistening with last\nnight’s rain towards the Middleway.\nHe caught a glimpse of flags through the budding branches. The crossed\nhammers of Angland, maybe. He heard the familiar tramp of armoured feet\nand let the curtains fall. No doubt they were still searching for him. Plainly,\nhe was far from free. But with Rikke on his side he had a chance. In Adua,\nself-styled zenith of civilisation, they liked to think of anything beyond the\nCircle Sea as primitive. But they could have learned a lot from the\nNorthmen. About courage, about endurance, about loyalty. About the\nenthusiastic use of wood, for that matter. He found he was smiling again.\nHe had no idea what would happen now. But for the first time in a long\ntime, he was eager to find out.\nHe padded down the stairs into the empty hallway.

Far from the first\ntime he had stolen from a lady’s bed, but the stakes had rarely been so high.\nHe heard soft voices, talking in Northern, and slipped across to the open\ndoor of the dining room.\nRikke sat at the head of a table set for breakfast. Isern-i-Phail had one\nhand on the back of her chair, leaning down to mutter in her ear. Orso had\nthe impression he had interrupted a difficult conversation, and more than\nlikely he had been its subject. By the frown on Isern’s face, his way with the\nladies did not extend to hillwomen. But then, since he lost the crown, his\nway with the ladies probably did not extend very far at all. It was something\nof a surprise that it still reached Rikke. Looking at her troubled expression\nnow, he wondered whether, in the cold light of morning, it might not fall\nshort of her, too.\nBut Orso’s father had insisted the best way to brighten the mood was to\nact as if it was already incandescent. An approach he had applied to Orso’s\nmother for thirty years with a total lack of success. So Orso plastered on a\nsmile, strutted into the room and called out, “Morning!” with almost\noffensive enthusiasm.\n“Barely,” said Isern as she stalked past him to the door, endlessly\nchewing. From the short patch of sunlight in front of the windows it could\nnot have been far short of midday.\n“My mother would have counted it quite the victory to get me up at this\nhour.” Orso licked his lips as he pulled out a chair. Last night’s exertions\nhad left him with an appetite. Well, that and barely eating for a few days.\n“Do you mind if I…?”\n“Dig in,” said Rikke.\nHe started to fork sausages onto a plate, mouth thoroughly watering. “Is\nthere anything better than a good meal after lean times?”\n“There’s a few in the North who’d swear by a good revenge after a long\nfeud.”\nHe closed his eyes in simple pleasure as he chewed. “Revenge won’t fill\nyour belly.”\n“You sound like my father.”\n“By all accounts a shrewd man.”\n“He was all heart,” said Rikke, nudging some crumbs about her plate.\nOrso felt that need to lift the mood again. “Have an egg,” he said,\nplucking one from a dish and holding it out. Not much of a gift, especially\nwhen it had been hers in the first place. But then the whole North was hers\nnow. She was the one with the power, while he had nothing to\nrecommend him but his winning sense of humour. “You don’t look…\nentirely happy,” he said.\nShe plucked the egg from his fingers and started tapping it against the\nedge of the table, gently breaking the shell. “Lots to think about.”\n“Regrets, eh?”\nShe looked up sharply. Looking into the gaping pupil of that Long Eye\nstill scared him and excited him at once. As though she might see some\nsecret truth in him that he had never guessed at. “Why d’you say that?”"

I recognise a fellow sufferer. It can’t be easy. To\nknow what’s coming.”\n“No.” She started to pick away the broken shell with her fingernails.\n“I’ve often argued with Isern over whether it’s a blessing or a curse. I swing\nback and forth.”\n“Don’t we all? Just flags, tugged wherever the breeze pleases.”\n“Even when it does open, the Long Eye never gives you all the answers.\nIt’s mist and whispers. You have to find your own way to the truth.” She\nlooked up at him again, and again he felt that excitement. And that fear.\n“You want the painful truth? A secret I haven’t dared tell anyone?”\n“Well… as long as it doesn’t hurt too much.”\nShe leaned towards him, dropping her voice. “The truth is… I used to\nsee things. Before my father died. Before I stole the North. Before I killed\nStour and Calder. Before I was Black Rikke and I was… a girl you gave an\negg to.” She waved a hand at her tattooed face. “But since the runes were\nwritten, nothing.” She bit into the egg and sat back, speaking around a\nmouthful. “Reckon my Long Eye’s closed for good.”\n“So… you pretend?”\n“I do what my father tried to. Give his people at least a bit of what they\nwant. Folk like the notion of someone who knows what’s coming. That way\nthey don’t have to worry about it.”\nOrso puffed out his cheeks. “I’d never know you had doubts. You seem\nso sure of yourself.” He gave a snort of laughter. Perhaps he had a type,\nafter all. “You remind me of Savine, in a way.”\nShe did not take it altogether as a compliment. “I’ve changed, that’s true.\nI’ve had to grow… harder.”\n“As an expert in disappointing their parents… I’m sure your father\nwould be very proud.”\nHe had meant that to be kind, but she winced as if the words hurt. “I\nwish I thought so. I had a vision. Just a year or two past, though it feels an\nage ago. It’s all come true, one way or another.” She looked out of the\nwindows, their bright squares reflected in her eye. “I saw a wolf eat the\nsun.”\nOrso pondered that. “Well, I’m no magus, learned in the interpretation of\nvisions… but I’d say that was Stour Nightfall making war on the Union.”\n“I saw a lion eat the wolf.”\nHe sat back, rather enjoying the game. “The Young Lion, beating the\nGreat Wolf in the Circle.”\n“I saw a lamb eat the lion.”\nOrso could not help but grin. “That was me, giving Brock a richly\ndeserved kick up the arse at Stoffenbeck.”\n“I saw an owl eat the lamb.”\nOrso’s grin faded. “Who’s the owl?”\n“No idea.” Now she looked at him, and with the strangest, saddest\nexpression. “Till now.”\nHe was starting to feel worried. “What is it?”\n“I’m the owl,” she said."

Caul Shivers was the first in,\nmetal eye glinting. Next came those two Anglanders Orso had often seen on\nthe front benches of the Court of the People, the big one and the lean one,\nGlaward and Jurand. The final guest was announced before his appearance\nby the squeaking of the bearings in his artificial leg, accompanied by that\nfamiliar sinking sensation of dashed hopes.\n“Leo dan Brock.” Orso forked up another piece of sausage but it seemed\nto have lost all its taste. “Do you never tire of killing my mood?”\nBrock looked even more gaunt, pale and furious than the last time Orso\nsaw him, the day the Lords Round burned and he stabbed Lord Marshal\nForest in the chest. All those high qualities everyone had once so envied—\nthe honesty, the bravery, the blunt good nature—seemed to have been\ncrushed out of him like the pulp out of a lemon, leaving just the bitter seeds\nof pride, anger and an insatiable need to conquer. That and a truly\nunforgivable lack of any sense of humour.\n“You’ve led me quite a dance the last couple of weeks,” he growled, as\nif Orso’s desperate attempts to stay alive were a personal affront.\n“Hardly my fault that you have such poor footwork,” said Orso.\nLeaning back against the doorway, Isern-i-Phail managed a titter.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, no one else was in the mood. Orso glanced about\nthe room, wondering if it would have been the done thing to try to make a\nbreak for it, but he very much doubted he could fight off Caul Shivers with\na fork.\nRikke spoke slowly, softly. As if she was trying to convince herself.\n“The North has been through the fire, Orso. I put it through the fire. If it was\njust about me…” She grimaced, then snapped the words angrily. “But I’ve\nall those people to think about now! They need peace.”\n“And I’m the price, I suppose.” Orso glanced from Glaward, to Brock,\nto Jurand, to Isern, to Shivers, and back to Rikke. “You promised to fight\nwith him against me. Then you broke your word. I’m what it costs you to\nget back in his good graces. If he even has any, these days.”\n“Constant pain can wear down your patience,” said Brock.\n“In Adua, we like to think of anything beyond the Circle Sea as\nprimitive.” Orso gave a sigh and placed his knife and fork neatly together\nwith a final sounding clink. He was finished. And not just with breakfast.\n“But it turns out you Northmen can teach us a thing or two about\ntreachery.”\nIsern might have given the tiniest careless shrug. Shivers did not move\neven that much. Rikke had, at least, the good grace to wince. “A leader\nneeds to be hard,” she said, frowning down at the table, “so others needn’t\nbe. She must make of her heart a stone.”"

She must make of her heart a stone.”\n“Or get rid of it altogether,” said Brock.\n“Finally we agree.” Isern-i-Phail scratched at the hollow above her\ncollarbone and winked. “Ruthlessness is a quality much loved o’ the moon.”\nOrso was tempted to scream and rage, but it would have ruined an\notherwise charming morning. He had acted for so many years, in the full\nand glaring view of the public, with an utter lack of dignity. Now, in private,\nhe insisted on keeping hold of every shred.\nHe slid his chair back, stood and gave Rikke his best formal bow.\n“Please allow me to say that I do not blame you for this in the least. Terrible\nmanners to just drop in. Entirely my own fault. I’m actually…” He gave a\ndisbelieving grin as he realised it was true. “I’m actually rather glad we had\nthis time together.”\nRikke winced again, even harder, as Glaward walked over with a set of\nheavy manacles. “Believe it or not, so am I.”\n“An unlikely romance, this,” sneered Brock, pale lip curled with evident\ndisgust. Or was it jealousy?\nRikke’s glance towards him was satisfyingly furious. “We’re even,” she\nforced through gritted teeth.\nBrock’s nostrils flared. The Young Lion might have had fewer limbs\nthan in his glory days, but he yet possessed a full set of heroic nostrils.\n“Take him somewhere he won’t bloody escape from,” he snapped at Jurand.\n“And the Lady Regent won’t find out about. Not until it’s time.” He looked\nback to Rikke. “We’re even. But we’ll be keeping our swords well\nsharpened, just in case.”\n“The Master Maker forged mine,” said Caul Shivers, in that broken\nwhisper of his. “It never gets blunt.” He made no effort to be threatening.\nThe one advantage of a giant scar and a metal eye, perhaps, is that being\nthreatening takes no effort whatsoever.\n“Huh.” And Brock’s mechanical leg squeaked faintly as he limped for\nthe door.\nThe bracelets snapped shut around Orso’s wrists. One could almost hear\nthe discomfort in Glaward’s voice. “Hope that’s not too tight, Your…”\n“No, no,” said Orso. “Most comfortable fetters I’ve worn, and I’ve tried\non quite a few lately.” He took one last look at Rikke, sitting there in the\nsunlight, at the head of the table. He would have liked more time with\nher. But he supposed it had never been very realistic. “Peace between\nthe North and the Union.” He gave a little chuckle. “Honestly, it’s a far\nbetter legacy than anyone expected from me.” And he strolled jauntily out\ninto the hall.\nWell, as jauntily as you can in chains.\nWhich isn’t very.\nAnswers\nV\nick threw the door shut and it banged from the frame, wobbled back\nopen a crack.

I thought we were supposed to\nstand with the winners—”\n“I’m in danger, Tallow, and that means all my friends are in danger.\nLuckily, I don’t have any friends.”\n“I’m probably the closest thing.”\n“Exactly.” She flicked the shabby curtains closed. “Which is why you\nhave to come with me.”\n“I what? Where?”\n“Still working out the details. The main thing is, not here. Believe me,\nI’m less than delighted about it myself.”\n“What about my sister?”\nVick winced. The question she’d always known was coming.\n“I can’t leave her,” he said, voice getting higher and higher, more and\nmore panicked. “I mean, she won’t get by on her own, I can’t go without\nher, I—”\n“Fine!” snapped Vick. “We’ll get her next. But we travel light, you\nunderstand?”\n“Be gentle,” muttered Tallow, stepping up to the door. “She scares easily.”\nHe knocked. Three slow, steady knocks. “It’s me,” he hissed at the lock.\nNothing. He knocked again. Three slow, steady knocks. “It’s me!”\n“Let’s go,” hissed Vick. This broke all her rules, and she had a bad\nfeeling.

It might be she’d only get more questions. It might be she’d get a\nfinal, crushing blow to the back of the skull, and darkness. But she wanted\nanswers.\nShe pushed the door open with a fingertip. Her face was sweaty from the\ninside of the bag, the air cool on her skin. A lamp was lit in the dining room.\nAn accusing finger of light stretched out across the boards towards her. She\nfollowed it down the hall, her knees a little weak, her mouth a little dry, her\nheart beating hard.\nVick’s guest sat at the dining table in the light of a single lamp,\nbrightness splashed across the sharp bones of his face, darkness gathered in\nthe deep lines. The squares board was set before him, the pieces Vick had\nknocked over returned to their places, casting long shadows across the\nchequered wood.\n“Inquisitor Teufel. I have been waiting for you.”\nNow it all made sense. And like every illusion, once Vick knew how it\nworked, she couldn’t understand how she hadn’t seen it right away.\n“You’re the Weaver,” she said.\nSand dan Glokta bared his ruined teeth as he sat back in his wheeled\nchair and considered her calmly. “Yes.”\n“Not Pike. Not Risinau. You.”\n“Me.”\n“You made the Breakers.”\n“Made? No, no.” Glokta let one thin finger trail across the pieces on the\nsquares board, as though considering his next move. “Society is a\ncompetition, and one cannot have winners without creating losers. People\nwho lose once tend to lose more, and people who lose too often become\ndiscontented. I merely… gathered them into a group. Gave them a name.\nPointed them in the right direction.”\n“You… were the architect of the Great Change?”\n“Architect sounds so grand. There was dry straw everywhere, I simply\nstruck the match.”\nShe thought of the bank in flames in Valbeck, the ash fluttering down.\nShe thought of the fires leaving their black scars through Adua. She thought\nof the Court of the People, burning up like a great torch to leave a blasted\nshell. “Why?”\n“Ah, why do I do this? Why?” Glokta gazed down at the squares board.\n“Because sometimes… to change the world… we must burn it down. Bayaz\ncontrolled everything. We all were pieces in his game.” He nudged one of\nthe smallest pieces forwards into empty space. “He owned the banks, and\nthe banks owned the merchants, owned the nobles, owned the treasury,"

The king himself danced to Bayaz’s music. The Closed Council, too.\nEven me, though I’m not much of a dancer these days. The Great Change\nwas the only way I could see to cut all the puppet strings at once. The only\nway I could see to make us…” Glokta shrugged his bony shoulders,\nwincing as though even that much movement gave him pain. “Free.”\n“Free?” Vick stared at him. “Is that what we are now?”\n“Within reason. People love the idea of freedom but, in my experience,\nthere is only so much they can be trusted with. You saw what Judge did\nwith it. Take it far enough, freedom becomes chaos. The voice of the\npeople… is just noise. It is the blather of the lunatics in the madhouse. It is\nthe squeal of the pigs in the slaughterhouse. It is a choir of morons. Most of\nthem don’t even know what they want, let alone how to get it. They need\nsomeone to tell them what to do.”\n“Someone like you, I suppose?”\n“Or you.” He waved towards the bench on the other side of the table.\n“Have a seat, Inquisitor. Towering over me like that, you’re making me\nnervous.”\nShe dropped down opposite him, numb. “If the Breakers were your tool,\nwhy send me to watch them?”\n“I needed to know what they were about. You may have noticed that\npeople have a habit of doing stupid, unpredictable things. And I could\nhardly show up to meetings.” He gently turned the squares board around,\nconsidering the position from the other side. “The Breakers would have\nbeen most upset, I imagine, to find they were taking orders from the man\nthey considered their worst enemy.”\n“Taking orders? A moment ago you were merely pointing them in the\nright direction.”\nLamplight glistened on his empty gums as he grinned. “You always\nwere a sharp interrogator. Sometimes I had to give a little more than\nguidance, I confess. Otherwise they might all have run off their own way,\nlike woodlice from a lifted log.”\n“Is that what happened in Valbeck?”\n“People are not machines that one can move with a lever. This business\nis more art than science.” Glokta licked unhappily at one of the teeth he still\nhad. “I had planned a dress rehearsal, you might say, but Risinau shit the\nbed on the timing, just as he shit the bed on everything. I am an inveterate\nbed-shitter myself, so I recognise the tendency in others. Sadly, as an old\ncolleague of mine was fond of saying, we must work with the tools we\nhave.”\n“What about Tallow? Is that even his name?”\n“Do you know, I forget his original name. I’d be surprised if even he\nremembers it.” Glokta let his forefinger rest on top of one of the smallest\npieces, as though considering a move. “I needed to know what you were\nabout. You may have noticed that people have a habit of doing stupid,"

Which you\ndid, admirably.”\n“He was your plant from the beginning?” she whispered.\n“Don’t be upset at him, Vick, it’s beneath you. I found him in the camps,\nlike you. I offered him the same deal and he made the same choice. The\nonly choice. To stand with the winners.”\nSo she’d finally found a better liar than herself. Or perhaps she’d just\nfound one she wanted desperately to believe. Strange, that the deaths of\nthousands left her cold, while the betrayal of one boy made her furious.\n“How did you know that I’d… how could you know—”\n“Don’t be too hard on yourself. We all have sore spots.” He grimaced as\nhe shifted in his chair. “I myself am one enormous one. And finding other\npeople’s has been my business for a very long time.” He nudged another\npiece forwards across the board. “I know you like to think there are no\nchinks in your armour but, really, you’re not too deep a mystery to fathom.\nTo me your guilt has always been plain as a sign around your neck. About\nthe Breakers in Valbeck. About Collem Sibalt and his friends. About the\nrebels in Starikland. About your mother and father. About your sisters and\nyour brother—”\n“That was all you!” she snarled in his face. “You made me do all that!\nSibalt, and the Breakers, and the rebels, and all the rest!” She stabbed at her\nchest with a finger and her voice warbled, cracked. “Why should I be\nguilty? What fucking choice did I have?” It had already become a plaintive\nwhine. Fates help her, almost a tearful one. “You’re the one… you’re the\none sent my family to the camps… in the first place…”\n“I am aware,” said Glokta calmly. He hadn’t even flinched. “Where they\ndied, and you survived. I told you to forgive yourself, remember? Your\nfamily simply weren’t tough enough. You are.”\nVick blinked down at the squares board, the anger already drained away\nto leave her hollow and helpless. Risinau, Judge, Orso, Leo dan Brock, they\nwere all small pieces in the game Glokta had been playing. So small they\nnever even guessed how vast the board truly was. Which made her what? A\nspeck of dust between the squares, at best.\n“Where were you rushing off to, anyway?” asked Glokta. “Talins? To\nwork for Shylo Vitari? Please, the woman’s a hack. We both know how\nbadly you want a cause worthy of your loyalty.” He winced as he twisted to\nreach into a pocket. “Arch Lector. Commissioner. It doesn’t matter what\nyou call it.

Practical Dole?”\nOne of the Practicals lumbered in, winced as he manoeuvred Glokta’s\nchair from behind the table. It caught one of the legs on the way and sent a\nfew squares pieces clicking over to roll around in helpless circles on their\nsides.\n“Feel free to refuse. I will understand.” Vick’s old master leaned to\nmurmur as he was wheeled past. “But we both know that ring will fit you\nperfectly.”\nShe heard the door shut and was left alone in a heavy silence. Just her\nand all the lies. Some she’d told, some she’d been told, some she’d told\nherself, until she’d no idea what was true any more. Until she’d no idea if\nthere was such a thing.\nVick picked up the ring, turning it around in her fingers. Who could’ve\ndreamed she’d one day wear it? The great stone shone in the lamplight, full\nof purple sparks. From the prison camps of Angland to the pinnacle of\npower.\nThen she caught sight of something in her bag. The worn gilt on the\nspine of The Life of Dab Sweet. She pulled it out, and it fell open on\nthe table at that favourite page. That favourite picture. The great plains,\ngrass going on for ever. A place where you can make yourself anew. Where\nyou can go as far as your dreams can take you.\nRubbish, most likely. A made-up drawing in a book full of lies. But there\ncomes a time you have to say no to what you’re given and reach for what\nyou want.\nThe truth was Vick had always wanted to be loyal. But not to nations, or\nideas, or causes. To people. Orso was gone. Sibalt was dead. Tallow had\nnever even existed. If she’d ever had a debt to Glokta it had only been in\nher own mind. One she chose to keep because she had nothing else. So she\npronounced it long since paid.\nShe tossed the ring spinning across the squares board, threw the bag\nover her shoulder and walked out without a backward glance.\nShe flung the door shut and it banged from the frame, wobbled back\nopen a crack.

She\ncould never have beaten him in a fair bout. But who wants to fight those?\nHis long steel was not even up when she caught it with hers, blade\nflickering, metal scraping, jerking it from his unready hand. She stepped\nsharply around him as he stumbled, planting her heel behind his where it\ncould trip him. He made a soft oof as her shoulder thudded into his\nbreastbone and sent him crashing onto his back, his short steel bouncing\naway across the well-tended grass.\nHis expression of total shock as the blunted point of her long steel\ntickled him under the chin was positively delightful.\n“Would that be a touch to me?” she asked, all innocence.\nHe slowly lifted his head. “I have a strange sense you’ve fenced before.”\n“I never said otherwise.” She stabbed her long steel into the turf and\noffered him her hand. “That was your assumption.”\n“You could’ve corrected me,” he said as she helped him up.\n“I just did. I’ve been fencing since I was a girl. My father taught me.”\nHe bent to collect his steels. “So… not only have you fenced before, but\nyou were trained by one of the best swordsmen the Union ever produced?”\nShe gave an artless shrug. “It’s fine exercise.” The moment he was up\nshe came at him again, but this time he was ready, parried and stepped\nwatchfully back towards the edge of the circle.\n“I expected to be giving a lesson,” he muttered. “I should have realised\nI’d be taking one.”\n“Not at all. I gave up playing with knives, after Valbeck…” The well-\nworn memory of her sword sliding through that man’s back. The faint\npressure of the grip in her palm. The look of shock on his face. But she\nfound she could dismiss it much more easily now. She had warned him,\nafter all. If he had not wanted to be stabbed he should have fucking left her\nalone. “Pregnancy and motherhood are hardly compatible with the fencing\ncircle. I am awfully out of practice.”\n“That was my first thought just now as I lay on my back with your\nsword at my throat. How awfully out of practice you seem.”\nHe jabbed warily at her and she flicked it away. Her legs felt heavier\nthan they once had, her breath came harder, but it felt good to be back in the\ncircle. She had spent too long curled up with her babies, growing soft and\nmotherly. It was high time that she exerted some discipline. That she\ncompeted. That she won. And not just with a sword.\n“I confess I was not looking only for a fencing partner,” she said.\n“An ulterior motive?” Jurand eyed her steels warily as they circled.\n“You shock me again.”\n“I wanted to talk to you about the future.”\n“To me?”\n“To you first of all.” She danced in, their blades rang together prettily\nenough but with no real fire, and they broke again. “The new Closed\nCouncil must represent the new Union, and you will be its heart. You\nshould be confirmed as Lord Chamberlain.”"

I need you at that table every bit as much as Leo does. You are a\nclever man, Jurand. Subtle and loyal. You have a gift for organisation. I\nwish you had been at Stoffenbeck with us. I begged Leo to bring you, but…\nwell.” She jabbed again, and again, left her wrist limp and let him parry\neasily. Nowhere near as sharply as she could have done. Nowhere near as\nsharply as her father once made her, again and again until her whole body\nwas on fire. “Glaward must have a seat, too, of course. As lord marshal,\nmaybe?”\n“I think that is what Leo had in mind.”\n“And perhaps he was thinking of, say, Isher as lord chancellor and\nHeugen as lord admiral?”\nJurand’s forehead wrinkled in surprise. “That’s exactly what he was\nthinking.”\n“Then it seems sensible to fill the Arch Lector’s and High Consul’s\nchairs with seasoned bureaucrats. People who understand the challenges of\nreform and can bring a weight of experience with them.”\n“That does seem sensible— Uh!” She made him twist away from a\nquick cut and trot back into space, shaking his head.\n“I am of the firm opinion, however…” Cut, cut, jab. “That it would be a\nmissed opportunity to return to the way things were in King Jezal’s reign.”\nJab, jab, cut. “A regime that ensured its own downfall with its waste, and\nexploitation, and callous disregard for its subjects.” Steel rang with each\nword. “We need a new kind of person on the Closed Council. Engineers and\narchitects. Investors and inventors.” Jurand came back at her and she\nparried once, twice, thrice. “People who understand the tools of the new\nage.” Jab, jab, jab. “Who can help us build a better Union.”\n“I don’t know, Leo can be quite traditional in his—”\n“We must move on, Jurand, and we must bring the people with us.

That oddly moving moment of\nunexpected honesty, beneath the House of Questions. She lowered her\nsteels and looked Jurand in the eye. “It can’t all be for nothing, you\nunderstand?”\nHe blinked, then swallowed, and his own steels slowly drifted down. “I\ndo.”\nSavine shook herself. “Shall we break?” Jurand was starting to get her\nmeasure, and that would never do. “There was a time I could keep fencing\nfor hours, but motherhood changes you in so many ways.”\n“Oh, of course.”\n“You are Leo’s oldest friend,” she said, with a wrong-footing change of\nsubject. “His best friend.” One should never let an opponent get\ncomfortable in a conversation, after all, any more than in fencing, or"

You must know that\nhe and I… are not entirely getting along.” She let him see her pain at that.\nHer regret. “But we simply must remain friends, for the sake of our\nchildren, for the sake of the nation. I have always felt one cannot have too\nmany friends.” She came closer, looking up shyly from under her lashes.\n“Are…\nwe friends, Jurand?”\nHe was caught between sympathy and mistrust. “I would like us to be. I\nmean, I like to think we are.”\n“I cannot tell you what a comfort that is.” She rested a gentle hand on\nhis forearm. A little human contact, carefully administered, can have such a\npowerful effect. “To know that even if I have made a mess of things with\nLeo, we will always have a good friend in common.”\n“I don’t want to deceive you, I have to be Leo’s friend first.”\n“Of course! I should have been a better friend to him myself. I know it\nwas a fool’s mistake to let Orso go, but I allowed my heart to overcome my\nhead, for once. He is my brother, after all, I have…” She had to swallow,\nthe emotion not entirely feigned. “Complicated feelings about him.”\nShe had thought this might be where Jurand grew suspicious, but for\nsome reason he looked nervous instead. Was there even pity in his eyes? As\nif he had some secret on the tip of his tongue… but in the end he swallowed\nit. “Perhaps… you should tell Leo that. I’m sure he’d like to hear it.”\nSavine would sooner have set herself on fire than apologise for saving\nOrso’s life. She passed it off with an emotional sniff. “I fear Leo will not\nlisten to me any more. For good reasons, I know. But he will listen to you.”\n“I agree with you about the Closed Council. And about changing the\nUnion for the better. I agree with you about a lot of things. But Leo—”\n“Please, Jurand.” She did not let her lower lip actually wobble, or her\neyes fill with tears. That would have been sugaring the pudding too much.\nBut she let her voice crack, ever so slightly. Jurand was a caretaker. A fixer\nof problems, happiest when he was needed. So she let herself be needy. “I\nneed your help. We all do.” She gave his forearm a gentle squeeze. “For my\nsake and his.” She looked up earnestly into his face. “For the sake of our\nchildren.” She left herself defenceless. “For the sake of the nation. Can I be\nentirely honest with you? Can I lay myself bare?”\nHe hardly knew what to say to that. “I, er—”\n“I think we are alike, in many ways. I can be quite perceptive, too.” She\neased even closer, squeezed his arm tighter, made her voice softer so he had\nto lean down towards her. “I have started to believe that Leo…” She fixed\nhim with her eye and whispered the words. “Is in love with someone else."

Until she was satisfied that neither\none of them could have any doubts exactly what she meant. Then, with a\nfinal squeeze, she let him go and took up her steels again, all business. “I\ncan only apologise, I have wandered so far from the subject. Women!

Forward-\nlooking people, each with fine qualities. Properly led, with Leo’s charisma\nand your prudent oversight, they will be invaluable servants of the Crown.”\n“Well…” His mind was clearly elsewhere as he took his mark. “I\nsuppose I can talk to Leo.”\n“That’s all I ask.

Jurand\nmanaged to stumble back from the first, just about parried the second, but\nthe last three thudded into his padded jacket in about the same spot, rocking\nhim back on his heels then sending him stumbling from the circle.\n“Oh,” said Savine. “I suppose that would be another touch to me?”\nJurand winced as he rubbed at the dent in his jacket. “Is there anything\nyou do badly?”\n“Lose.” She gave her sweetest smile. “I swear I’m the worst loser in the\nworld.”\nWhen Savine walked into the gilded immensity of the Lord and Lady\nRegents’ great chamber, Zuri was sitting in a pool of lamplight, working at\nthe book."

We could have a triangular Lords’ Round, apparently. Or one that\nlooks like a wedding cake.” She slipped the box from her sleeve and took a\nlittle pinch of pearl dust. Just to keep things afloat. “But there were some\ngood ideas.” She stifled a sneeze. “And they’re already clearing the site.\nWithin ten years the Union will have a new heart, bigger and better than\never.”\n“Progress, then.” Zuri permitted herself a little smile. “Whoever would\nhave thought the Union would have a big heart.”\n“How are the children?” asked Savine, stepping towards the tall door to\nthe nursery, decorated with the sun of the Union in gold leaf.\n“They are well, but…” Zuri put a gentle hand on Savine’s arm. “You\nshould know they have a visitor.” And she eased the door open.\nSavine’s mother stood beside the cots, rocking her tiny namesake with\npractised carelessness, pulling faces while the baby gurgled happily.\n“Savine!” she said, prancing over. “It’s so good to see you!” Quite as if\nthey were an ordinary mother and daughter and it had been an ordinary few\ndays since they last spoke, rather than six terrifying months in which Savine\nhad nearly died, given birth, nearly died again, then taken control of a\nnation.\nShe leaned forwards to kiss Savine’s cheek and gave her a noseful of\nthat familiar, heady mix of perfume and alcohol. The smell of her\nchildhood. The smell of being cared for, in an offhand, slightly lazy way.\nSavine felt herself caught on uncertain ground between fury at being\nabandoned and sappy relief that her mother was alive and had danced into\nher life again.\n“You look… well,” she managed to say.

It’s certainly beneath\nyou now you’re the Lady Regent of the Union.”\nShe was right, of course, but that did not help, of course. “You can’t\njust… turn up, Mother.”\n“Isn’t that what grandmothers do? Avoid all the work then whisk in for\nthe glory? It’s safe, now, isn’t it?”\n“Of course, but—”\n“It wasn’t safe before.”\n“I am aware. I was thinking very much the same thing while I sat in the\nmidst of at least two different riots, then in prison, then in the dock.”\n“Your father and I sitting there with you would only have made things\nworse.” Harod gave an annoyed burble, and Savine’s mother softened her\nexasperated tone. “I wanted to be there, to help you through it all. When\nthe babies were born, of course I wanted nothing more. But I knew all I\ncould do was to put you in more danger. And I knew you’d make it through.\nYou’ve always been such a fighter. Such a modern, can-do woman. You\nreally are so like your father. The pair of you simply refuse to be beaten.”\n“He isn’t my father,” grumbled Savine, but it sounded churlish. How the\nhell could she have come out of this as the unreasonable one?\n“Whether you like it or not, he’s your father in every way that counts.”\n“Then where was he?”"

Break the ice. You know how\nit is, Savine, married couples tend to specialise, and I’ve always done the\nsmall talk, while he was more interested in—”\n“The torture?”\n“I was going to say the long-term planning, but no doubt you’ll have it\nyour way. You always have.”\nSavine pronounced every word with angry precision. “Believe me when\nI say that I have not. Where is he?”\nHer mother nodded towards an unused door. “Can I stay with them? For\na while?”\nSavine wanted to say no. But she had never known how to say no to her\nmother. And Harod was clinging to her finger so tightly, the bloody little\ntraitor. It would only have been punishing the children, and everything was\nsupposed to be about them, now. Having a child limits one’s choices. Two\nat once is an even worse constriction. Make one of them a king and you\nlose all say in anything.\nSavine gave a hopeless shrug. “Since you’re here.”\nShe turned the key in the door and stepped through.\nShe had never found out why they called it the Sighing Room. Perhaps\nsome royal widow had worn her life away in endless mourning there. It had\nthree doors, one to the nursery, one to their great chamber and one out into\nthe hallway. The walls had been scrubbed clean of the Breakers’ slogans\nand freshly whitewashed, but Savine had not got as far as decorating. In any\nreasonable house it would have been a grand salon. In the palace it was one\nstep above a cupboard. But it had a fine, high vaulted ceiling, and a stone\nfloor polished by the passage of centuries of servants’ feet, and a beautiful\nwindow. There was excellent light in the mornings, so Leo had\nrequisitioned the place for Carmee Groom to paint his portrait. In the\nevenings, though, it was quiet, and dim, and full of shadows.\nSavine’s father—in every way that counted—sat in that wheeled chair\nCurnsbick had designed for him, knees making two knobbles in the blanket\nacross his withered legs, frowning at the unfinished canvas. The Young Lion\nbursting through the city gates astride a sable charger to deliver the nation\nfrom chaos, sending as yet roughly sketched traitors routing for their\ncowardly lives.\nSavine walked to him, skirts hissing on stone in the heavy silence. All\nthe way her mouth was open to speak, but when she got to the chair she still\nhad not found the words. In the end, she simply put her hand on her father’s\nbony shoulder, the way she might have years ago. He laid his hand on top\nof hers. They looked up at the half-finished painting of Leo embodying the\nmanly virtues, his iron leg hidden by horseflesh and his ruined arm by gold\nbraid, pointing his sword towards a better tomorrow.\n“I think it will be a fine portrait,” said her father. “Somewhat"

It’s also an absolute pack\nof lies.” He gave a sigh. “But if people wanted the truth they could look at\nthe real world. In my experience they much prefer paintings.”\n“Paintings are less likely to kill you.”\n“There is that. Where is the Lord Regent himself? Delivering the nation\nfrom peril once again?”\n“Overseeing the organisation of his new army.”\n“Someone’s compensating for something. But I suppose a warrior must\nhave a sword.”\n“I understand they’re calling it the Regent’s Own.”\n“That could apply as much to the Lady Regent as the Lord.” Savine’s\nfather glanced up at her. “I always thought armour would suit you rather\nwell.”\n“Difficult to nurse in a breastplate. And toy soldiers were never my\nplaythings, as a girl.”\n“Neither were dolls. As I recall it was fencing, money and power from\nthe time you could talk, which was precociously early.”\n“Did it ever occur to you that those things interested me because they\ninterested you?”\n“Who cares where they came from? They’re fine interests to have.” His\ngrin became a grimace as he clawed at one of the wheels of his chair,\nturning it towards her. “I have to tell you how impressed I am, Savine. You\nnot only plotted a safe path through this madness but made yourself\nexceedingly popular in the process. Quite the feat, for a woman who once\nput so much effort into making herself unpopular.”\n“I can do without your flattery,” she lied. Honestly, his approval was still\na headier drug than pearl dust to her. No one knew her better than he did.\nNo one understood her so well. Except Orso, perhaps, and he was gone.\nHe took her hand in both of his, frowning down at it. “You have no\nidea how hard it has been, to know you were in danger. But with your\nmarriage… and the choices you made afterwards… you put yourself\nbeyond my reach. I hope you can understand that I was always doing my\nbest to help you, in my own way. Someone had to have an eye on the\nbigger picture. I was working with Superior Pike to bring this madness to\nan end.”\nA cold sliver of doubt pierced the warm fuzz of their reunion and began\nto stab deeper. “Working with Pike? Wasn’t he behind all this?”\n“No, Savine. The time has come for me… at long last… to confess.” His\neyes slid up to hers, bright in their bruised sockets. There was no remorse in\nthem. If anything, he had a kind of stubborn pride as he said the words. “I\nwas.”\nHer hand was prickling where he held it. “What do you mean?”\n“When I was a young man, and widely admired—there actually was a\ntime, if you can believe it—I always imagined the power was in the Closed\nCouncil.

He controlled the banks, and their roots ate into everything. A web of\ndebts, and secrets, and favours, deeper than you can imagine. Valint and\nBalk.” His eyelid flickered, and he dabbed a streak of wet from his weepy\neye with a knuckle. “They were like ivy choking the garden. King Jezal and\nI… you might not believe it, but we tried to do some good. As long as\nBayaz was there… we were helpless.” He paused, shadows black in the\ndeep lines of his frowning face. “I had to bring a Great Change.”\nSavine could only stare at him, while the floor seemed to shift under her\nfeet. Seemed to shift so savagely it was hard, almost, to keep her balance.\n“You… brought the Great Change?”\n“I had to burn out the corruption. Rip Bayaz and his bank up by the\nroots! Dig it all over, so we could plant something new, something good.”\nHe sat forward, gripping her hand tight, lips curling back from his ruined\nteeth. “And now we have that chance!”\n“Don’t talk to me about fucking gardening!” she screamed, tearing her\nhand from his. “People died! Thousands of them!” She felt dizzy. She felt\nsick. “I nearly died, more than once!”\nHe gave a frustrated twitch, as if the problem was not his epic\nruthlessness but her poor temper. “Progress does not come without\nsacrifices—you have always seen that more clearly than anyone. The Court\nof the People was not at all what we had in mind, but once it became clear\nwhat a disaster Risinau would be, Judge was the only option. Who could\nhave known Judge would be even worse?”\n“Anyone! Anyone who saw what she did in Valbeck! Anyone with eyes\nor ears in their head! The woman was fucking insane!”\n“A period of insanity was necessary so that sanity could prevail,”\ngrumbled her father, as if she was complaining about footprints on a rug. “I\nwould have liked a more… orderly transition, but Bayaz began to show an\ninterest in you, and I could not risk that. Honestly, Savine, a little gratitude\nwould not kill you.”\n“Gratitude?” she whispered.\n“I did it all for you. So you could truly rule. All your life, we’ve been\npreparing you for this.”\n“My mother knew what you were planning?”\n“It was her idea in the first place. One of her best.”\nSavine did not often find herself at a loss for words. She slowly stepped\nback, pointing at her father with a trembling hand. “Because… I was King\nJezal’s bastard. You knew all along… if Orso could be removed, I could be\nput in his place!”\n“Your parentage was not a choice we made.”\n“Only something you turned to your advantage!”\n“To everyone’s advantage!” he barked, wheeling himself towards her.\n“Put aside your pique, Savine, this was war.

We will finally\nhave a free hand!”\n“We?” she whispered.\n“Your son will be king, but he will need your guidance.” He gripped her\narm, and there was strength in those thin fingers. A grasping strength. “And\nyou will need mine.”\nSavine stared at him, cold all over. “You freed us from Bayaz…”\n“Yes!”\n“So you could become Bayaz.”\nHe narrowed his eyes. “That is unfair.”\n“You’re right.” She twisted her arm free, taking another step back. “He\nonly destroyed half the Agriont for his own ambitions. You destroyed half\nthe Union!”\n“You were willing to destroy a sizeable chunk of it for the sake of your\nambitions, as I recall. You and your husband’s revolt against the crown\nnearly ruined everything.”\nShe gave a disbelieving gasp. “Was my mistake that I spoiled your\nefforts to burn down the world? Or that I didn’t burn down enough of it?”\n“Both,” he said.\n“I should have denounced you, in the Court of the People,” whispered\nSavine. “I should have denounced you to hell.”\n“You should have. It might have improved your situation and could not\npossibly have done me any harm. That is the kind of sentimental mistake I\ncan help you avoid in future. You have a struggle ahead of you, Savine.” He\ngave the painting a significant glance. “Your husband may prove more\ndifficult to control than anyone imagined. We cripples have a habit of\nsurprising people. And freeing Orso was a blunder you may well regret.\nThen there are the nobles, and the commoners, and the Styrians, and the\nImperials, and the Gurkish will not stay down for ever…” Enemies\nstretching off ahead of her, enough to fill a lifetime. “The time will come,\nsooner than you think, when you will need my support.”\nShe would have loved to tell him to fuck himself. At that moment, she\nwould have loved to punch him out of his chair. But although her eyes were\nnarrowed, and her fist clenched to do it, she did not indulge herself. Savine\nhad taken many roles over the momentous past year or two, or had them\nforced upon her. A helpless fugitive, a desperate killer, a disappointed lover,\na wife and a partner, a rebel and a traitor, a forger of alliances, a mother to\ntwins, a benefactor to orphans, the wretched accused, the terrified\nconvicted, the Darling of the Slums and the Mother of the Nation. A journey\nof giddy rises, horrifying falls and wild reverses that could leave no one the\nsame. But, above all, Savine had always been a woman of business.

Outside, in the gardens. Savine’s father frowned\ntowards the window. An angry cry, cut off in another crash, even louder, as\nif something heavy had fallen from a height.\n“What was that?” For some reason, Savine felt the need to whisper.\nHer father held up a hand, eyes still narrowed at the window. “Stay\ncalm.”\n“Calm? What have you done?”\n“Freed us from Bayaz.” His eyes flickered sideways towards a muffled\nyell. “But the First of the Magi was never going to simply let us steal the\nUnion from under his nose.”\nSavine heard shouting in the corridor, then a long, thin scream. She took\nan unsteady step away. She had been on a battlefield and knew what\ngenuine agony sounded like. It ended in a sickening metallic crash, and\nanother, closer, then a crunching thud so near and so hard that Savine felt\nthe floor vibrate. The painting rattled on its stand. Dust filtered gently down\nfrom the vaults above.\nHer father slowly, effortfully swivelled his chair towards the door to the\nhallway. “Get behind me,” he said.\nThe knob turned and the door swung open. A face appeared around the\nedge. An unremarkable face, with different-coloured eyes.\n“Knock, knock.” Yoru Sulfur stepped into the room. He was neatly\npresented, as he had always been at meetings of the Solar Society. That\nsame polite manner, that same unassuming smile. The only difference that\nhe was spattered from head to toe with blood.\nSavine took a quivering step back. These rooms were the best guarded in\nthe Union. He must have come through several well-armed men. She\npresumed it was their screams she had heard, their gore with which he was\nshowered.\nHe called himself a magus, but she had thought of it as a hollow title,\nleft over from a distant age of ignorance and superstition. She knew that\nBayaz had ruined the Agriont, but that had been before she was born. She\nhad heard people whisper about Eaters, but written it off as small-minded\nfearmongering. Every day she had seen the dark outline of the House of the\nMaker, looming over even the city’s tallest chimneys, but she had somehow\nallowed herself to believe that actual magic would never play a role in her\nthoroughly structured, ruthlessly rational, entirely modern life.\nIt was with a feeling of chill horror that she discovered her error.\nSulfur smiled at her father. The smile of a disappointed tutor, finally\ntracking down a wayward pupil. “Sand dan Glokta.

A piece of\nbone. Perhaps a tooth. He flicked it away and it bounced clicking across the\nfloor. “I warned my master you could not be trusted.”\n“What useful people can be?”\nSulfur smiled wider, showing a full set of clean, sharp teeth. “Do you\nknow? Those were his very words.” He glanced towards Savine, who was\nclinging to one of the handles of her father’s chair, no idea whether to stand\nher ground, run for the children or scream for help. “Did you really think\nyou could stuff King Jezal’s bastard onto the throne without even a by-your-\nleave?”\n“I did. I have.”\n“Doing it is one thing. Getting away with it is quite another. For a man\nwho complains so much about pain you have been happy to inflict it\nwholesale.” Sulfur gently wagged one finger as he padded across the room\ntowards them. “All this destruction, just to end up trapped by your own\ncleverness.”\n“No doubt this is a trap.” Glokta looked up mildly at Sulfur. “But not for\nme.”\n“What will you do, cripple? Wheel your chair over me?”\n“You forget, I have some experience with your kind. The best weapon\nagainst an Eater… is another.”\nA latch dropped with a soft scrape and Sulfur froze in the middle of the\nfloor.\nZuri had slipped in through the nursery door. Savine was about to\nscream at her to get out, to get help, but something stole her voice, so all\nthat came out was a reedy squeak. Zuri’s head hung over on one side, her\nteeth showing very white as she smiled too wide, her eyes gleaming black\nin the shadows.\n“Someone has been a very bad boy,” she said.\nSulfur spun towards the door he had come in through, but Haroon had\nentered from the hallway and now pushed it firmly shut. Rabik dropped\nfrom the shadows among the vaults above, spun in the air as neatly as an\nacrobat and landed silently on all fours. Savine had no idea how she could\nhave failed to notice him, clinging to the ceiling. But she saw him now.\n“It has been a long time, Sulfur,” he sang, rocking back on his haunches.\n“So much to answer for,” said Haroon.\nThe shock on Sulfur’s face only lasted for an instant. Then the air above\nhis shoulders shimmered and Rabik was flung across the room as if by a\nslap from a giant’s hand. Savine gasped as he crashed into the window in a\nspray of glass, bounced from the stone frame leaving a great crack. He\nshould have been dead, every bone shattered. Instead he fell in a ready\ncrouch like a cat dropped from a high place, dust showering from a great\ndry split in his cheek but his mouth still fixed in a smile.\nSulfur and Haroon were fighting, too fast for Savine’s darting eyes to\nfollow, a tangle of flailing limbs, blows landing with thuds and smacks so\nloud they were painful on the ear.

Sulfur was turning, mouth twisted, arm\nraised, when she dropped on him with a crash like a thunderclap, buckling\nthe polished floor, shattering the polished stones, chips of rock and spots of\nblood flying, sending out a wash of wind that rocked the painting on its\neasel.\nThere was a brilliant flash. Savine squeezed her eyes shut but still saw\nthe bloom of fire through her lids, felt the heat of it stinging her face. She\nfell on her side, a roar all about her like a great furnace catching light. She\ncoughed, retched, throat full of the acid tang of burning. Haroon was bent\nover her father’s chair, shielding them both with his body, hair on fire, beard\non fire, shirt turning black as it burned, hanging off his arms in flaming\nstrips.\nSavine tried to shield her face but her sleeve was on fire. She dragged\nherself up by the arm of her father’s chair, saw the blanket across his knees\nwas burning, too, ripped it from his legs, dragging him around a squealing\nquarter turn, beating at her sleeve with it, trying to smother the flames.\nLittle fires were scattered across the floor, blurred and sparkling through\nthe tears stung from her eyes. Leo’s ruined painting was scorching, canvas\ncurling, the room crazily lit by flickering flames, cast into dancing shadow.\nSulfur reeled and thrashed while Rabik clawed at him, bit at him, his hair\nturned to a burning torch. Sulfur flung him away but Rabik tore a mouthful\nof meat from his face as he went, ripping one of his ears half off, tumbling\nacross the floor, spinning, sliding, fingernails squealing as they scored long\nscratches in the stones.\nSulfur crouched, breath coming in hisses, blood coursing from the bite-\nmarks on his face, blood dripping from his fingertips and pattering on the\nbroken flags.\nHe looked towards the window but Rabik was there, his bloody tongue\nhanging out. He looked towards the nursery but Haroon was there, giving a\nrumbling growl as he slapped ash from his body. He looked towards the\nhallway but Zuri was there. Her charred clothes dangled from her in tatters,\nand underneath her long limbs were bound in white bandages. She neatly\nblew out a flame still burning on her shoulder and clicked her tongue in\nannoyance.\n“This was my favourite dress,” she said.\nSulfur rounded on Savine and her father. She caught a glimpse of his\nbared teeth shining, his different-coloured eyes turned black in the dying\nfirelight. The air about his shoulders shimmered once more and Savine took\na whooping breath to scream."

The children are safe.”\n“Safe?” whispered Savine. Her hand was burned. The sleeve of her dress\nwas scorched. The skin beneath tingled. Faint through the door, she could\nstill hear them, eating. “Zuri is… Zuri is…”\n“Yes. Did you think we picked her as your companion by accident?”\n“You had to be protected,” said Savine’s father, baring the teeth he still\nhad as he wheeled his chair towards her. “I made an arrangement with the\nonly ones who could do it.”\nSavine stared from one parent to another. “You used me as bait. Me and\nmy children—”\n“We used ourselves as bait,” said her mother.\n“It had to be done, Savine,” said her father.\n“God smiles on results, my scripture teacher would have said.”\nZuri shut the door behind her.

When the solid foundations were\nrevealed to be shifting sands, and all her certainties no more than guesses.\nShe wanted to back away. Wanted to run out into the hall and keep running.\nBut she stood her ground. “Who was your scripture teacher?” she croaked.\n“The Prophet Khalul,” said Zuri, stepping into the room. “As you have\nno doubt guessed.” Her hair had come unpinned on one side, hanging\nacross her bloody face, her bloody chin, her bloody throat in a black\ncurtain. “I wish I could have told you sooner.”\n“Is your name even Zuri?”\n“I have had others, but I am Zuri now. I will be Zuri for as long as you\nneed me.”\n“You were my friend,” whispered Savine.

Zuri already had her hand in hers, so\ngentle but so strong, the black hair softly settling across her bloody face.\n“But soon I came to respect you, then to admire you, then… to love you.”\nShe reached up and delicately wiped a tear from Savine’s cheek with her\ncool thumbtip.\n“I am very old,” she said. “I did not think I had anything to learn. But\nwe have learned so much from you. Imagine a South and a Union not\nopposed but bound together by trade, and industry, and common interest.\nNot looking always into an ignorant and superstitious past but fixed on\nprogress.” Her black eyes shone at the thought. “A South and a Union\nwhere the people are governed not by the selfish whims of priests or\nwizards, but by the righteous engineering of the watch and the book.”\n“What would your scripture teacher think of that?” whispered Savine.\n“It has been many years since I cared a shit for his opinions.” And Zuri\ngave a little smile. Like a lover, venturing a joke so they could see if they\nwere forgiven for some petty misdemeanour. By the Fates, could Savine\nstill hear the faint cracking of bone from the room next door?\nHer father, who had burned half the world so he could control the other\nhalf, put a hand on her wrist. “You need our advice.”\nHer mother, who had helped hatch the colossal scheme, put a hand on\nher shoulder. “You need our support.”"

The world might not have been quite what she\nthought but, above all, Savine had always been a woman of business. And a\nwoman of business must adapt quickly to new circumstances and recognise\na bargain when she sees it. She had handled difficult partners before, after\nall, and come out ahead.\nShe slid the box from her sleeve and took a healthy pinch of pearl dust\nup each nostril. Then another. Just to stop her hands from shaking. She\nwiped her nose carefully, dabbed her eyes on her unburned sleeve, pushed\nher chin up and her shoulders back, and managed something like a smile.\n“Well,” she said. “No one ever achieved anything alone.”\nGreat Men’s Footsteps\nW\nasn’t till Rikke was walking up the steep cobbled way from the harbour\nthat she realised how much she’d missed Uffrith. Missed the sea’s smell and\nthe gulls’ clamour. Missed knowing every street and face. Missed her father.\nHis memory had been getting hazy, in the echoing space of Skarling’s Hall,\nin the grand salons of Adua. Here it rushed back so sharp she wanted to cry.\nFor the first time in a long time, she felt like she was home.\nShe wandered beneath the carved rafters where she and Leo had sat\ntogether as children. Her fingertip left a snaking trail through the dust on the\nseat where her father had given his judgements. She stepped from the\nshadows and into the sunny garden, and dropped down on the time-greyed\nbench, frowning off towards the sea.\nSpring had been busy. The garden was overgrown again, just like it\nalways used to be, the stuff her father planted all erupted in a messy riot,\nnothing like his plans. A creeper had slipped free from the crumbling wall\nand spilled white flowers across his grave. He’d have laughed to see it, most\nlikely, and said time makes fools of us all.\nShe thought of the girl she’d been, when Isern took her up into the hills\nto prove she had the Long Eye. Foolish and twitchy and soft. Ignorant about\nso many things. No bones and no brains, maybe, but a good heart. She\ntouched her fingertips to the tattoos on her face. So much changed. She\nwondered if it was really for the better.\n“Your father loved this plot.” Shivers stood in the doorway, arms folded.\n“Naught he liked more than sitting back and watching things grow,” she\nsaid.\n“It’s grown, all right.”\n“Aye, well, he never had much time for weeding, what with all the wars\nhe got dragged into.”\n“True enough. But you’ve made the whole North your garden now.”\nShivers shook his head like he could hardly believe it. “Reckon he’d be\nproud.”\n“Would he? After all I’ve done? Black Rikke, they call me.”\n“A proud name.”\n“A name they hung on a killer ’cause he was the worst man in the\nNorth.”"

It’ll be what you make of it.”\n“Aye, I guess.” And Rikke slumped with her elbows on her knees and\nher chin propped in her hands. “Did I do the right thing, Shivers?”\n“You’re asking the wrong man, I reckon.”\n“I’m asking the only one I trust.”\n“’Cause I done so much o’ the wrong thing?”\n“Shows you know the difference, don’t it?”\n“Not sure there is one.” He sank down on the bench beside her. “It’s a\ncomfort, telling yourself there’s some big right thing out there. That you\ncould seek some wise old bastard in the mountains who’s got the answer.\nThen there’d be no need for doubts and regrets.” He looked sideways,\nsunlight glinting off his metal eye. “But far as I can tell it ain’t that simple.\nRight things, wrong things, well… it’s all a matter of where you stand.\nEvery choice is good for some, bad for others. And once you’re chief, you\ncan’t just do what’s good for you, or those you love. You have to find\nwhat’s best for most. Worst for fewest. Like your father tried to, and with no\nmagic eye to see the outcome.” He sat back, one leg stretched out, and\nlooked towards the sea, breeze stirring the grey hair about his craggy face.\n“Doubts and regrets, they’re the cost of casting a shadow. The only folk\nwithout ’em are the dead. For what it’s worth, I’d say you did the best you\ncould.”\nRikke looked towards her father’s grave and winced. “Then why does it\nhurt so much?”\n“Said you did your best. Didn’t say it wouldn’t hurt. One thing I can tell\nyou…” And he frowned down at that ring on his little finger. “Doing your\nworst feels no better.”\n“By all the fucking dead, don’t tell me you’re sitting here pining.” Isern\nstrutted into the garden, chagga squelch, squelching as she worked her jaw.\nRikke ground her own teeth. She was tiring of the sound of Isern-i-Phail\nbeing right. “Doubts and regrets, Isern. They’re the cost of casting a\nshadow.”\n“Surely, but you’ve no time to indulge yours. You’ve the whole North to\nlead from the darkness and into the moon’s silvery favour. Tell me this—\nwhat else could you have done?”\n“Nothing,” grunted Rikke, slumping further into her hands, flicking the\nring through her nose with a fingertip so it knocked against her lip.\n“Nothing at all.” Hadn’t stopped her turning it over every spare moment\nsince they set off from Adua. Didn’t stop her turning it over now.\n“Brought him back here?” sang Isern, in a voice leaking mockery. “Put a\nstring on him like a puppy? How d’you keep a king o’ the Union secret?"

And folk\nhere would’ve blamed you for that trouble and called you a selfish bitch\nthinking with her quim and said this is what you get when you’re fool\nenough to put a woman in charge, and they’d have been right. Selfishness\nand folly. All we’ve worked for would’ve done like cake in a hailstorm and\nturned to soggy shit. This way you’ve got peace. And not just for you.\nPeace for all.”\nThe same arguments Isern had whispered in her ear that morning, while\nOrso lay sleeping in her bed, helpless, all his trust put in her. She’d been\nright then, and she was right now, and Rikke knew it, and it only made her\ngrind her teeth harder.\n“I know that,” she snapped. “Said there was nothing else I could’ve\ndone, didn’t I?”\n“Then why d’you look like you ate a thistle?”\n“I know it with my head.”\n“But what? Your heart hurts? Told you to make a stone of it, didn’t I?”\n“You might’ve uttered the phrase a time or two,” growled Rikke.\nIsern didn’t notice her bubbling anger or, more likely, didn’t care. “We\nneed to get back to Skarling’s Hall.” And she planted her hands on her hips\nand frowned at the garden like it was a midden. “That’s where the big\nchoices are made. That’s where Skarling turned down a crown and Bethod\ntook one up. Where Black Dow stole the North from the Bloody-Nine.\nWhere you stole it from Stour Nightfall. Every corner of the place, covered\nin great men’s footsteps.”\n“No.”\nRikke was shocked, almost, that she said it. But the moment she made\nthe choice, she was sure of it. “The only place those great men’s footsteps\nlead is round and round in circles of blood,” she said. “The only history\nthere is violence and betrayal. Send to Hardbread and the rest. Tell ’em I’m\nstaying here.”\n“The North is ruled from Skarling’s Chair.”\n“Same thing goes for great men’s arses as great men’s feet. It’s just a\nchair.”\n“The North is ruled from Carleon,” grumbled Isern, jutting her lip out in\na mighty frown.\n“It was. Now it’ll be ruled from Uffrith. Close to the sea where we can\nreach out to other lands and I can take a paddle when I’m in the mood.”\n“Paddle, by the dead. Shivers, tell her.”\nBut all Shivers did was shrug. “Great folk are great ’cause they plant\nnew footsteps. Not ’cause they blunder through the same mistakes some\nother bastards made.”\nIsern made a long hiss of disgust. “Folk won’t like it. Won’t understand\nit.”\n“That’s their lookout,” said Rikke, waving it angrily away.\n“It’s a mistake.”\n“It’s mine to make.”\n“You don’t know what you—”"

I’m the\none killed Stour Nightfall. I’m the one beat Black Calder. I make the\nchoices. Not you. Me!” She snarled it in Isern’s face and stabbed at her\nchest with a finger. “If I choose to rule the North from a midden sitting on a\npiss-bucket, that’s how it’ll be. If I choose to follow the footsteps my father\nleft in this garden, that’s how it’ll be. If I choose to make o’ my heart a\nbleeding fucking sponge, then, by all the dead, Isern-i-Phail, that,” and she\nspat the word like a curse, “is how it will be!”\nThere was a long silence, then. Just the gulls calling, and the sea rolling\nin, and the faint pulse of angry blood in Rikke’s head. The smile started as a\ncrinkle at the corners of Isern’s eyes, then it spread to her mouth, to her\ncheeks, till it was right across her face. “Finally! I’d a worry you’d never\nget there.”\nRikke closed her eyes. “So that was a bloody lesson, too, was it?”\n“Aye, a little bit.” Isern grinned as she offered out a chagga pellet. “With\nany luck the last you’ll need.”\nShivers slapped his thighs and stood with a grunt. “You really going to\nrule sitting on a piss-bucket?”\n“Maybe I will,” said Rikke, taking a breath and looking out to sea. “But\ntell Hardbread to bring Skarling’s Chair down here, just in case.”\nThe Moment\nC\nlover took a deep breath and thumped on the damp green copper with his\nfist. He waited. He knocked again. He became wetter and wetter in the mist\nfrom the river. He raised his arm to knock again. A narrow hatch snapped\nopen, and a pair of rheumy eyes stared at him coldly from between thick\nbars.\n“Who’s this now?”\n“Jonas Clover’s my name.”\n“Jona-you-what?”\n“Clover!” called Clover over the noise of rushing water. “I was sent for.”\n“Why?”\nClover wondered if he might’ve somehow come to the wrong place. “To\nteach sword-work, I was told. That’s what I do. Teach sword-work.” Well,\nthat and betray employers, but that probably wasn’t something a potential\nemployer needed to hear.\n“And what was the name again?”\n“Jonas Clover!” he bellowed at the slot. Then added, quieter, “Used to\nbe Steepfield.”\n“Steepfield, is it? You should have said.”\nBolts clanked and the door creaked slowly open. An old man, bent under\nan old-fashioned suit of armour, frowned at him from the other side. He had\na long sword far too heavy for him, point wobbling wildly as he strained to\nkeep it level."

He had\na long sword far too heavy for him, point wobbling wildly as he strained to\nkeep it level.\nClover held up his hands. “I surrender.”\nThe ancient gatekeeper was not amused as he wrestled the door shut and\nfumbled with the bolts. “Like I haven’t heard that before.”\nHe made quite the performance of sheathing his sword then led Clover\npast a set of strange houses half-dug into the steep rocks, up a narrow valley\nand out into a wide yard. Three great, tapering towers were built into the\nmountainside ahead, joined at their bases but separating higher up, covered\nin dark ivy. They looked old. So old you might’ve thought the mountain had\nbeen built about them, rather’n the other way around.\n“Quite a building to find all the way up here,” said Clover.\n“It’s the Great Northern Library,” grunted the gatekeeper. “Never seen a\nlibrary before?”\n“Honestly… no.”\nFolk were busy with everyday chores in the yard. A thin woman was\nwashing clothes in a tub. A thickset old man was splitting logs with\npractised swings of an axe. A mass of books were heaped and spread on a\ntable where a girl with a mop of blonde curls flicked at an abacus with\nquick fingers. No one really looked like they had a pressing need for\ninstruction with the blade.\n“Anyone ask for a sword teacher?” called Clover, hopefully.\n“I did.” The woodcutter neatly split one more log and left his axe buried\nin the block. He turned towards Clover, slapping dust from his hands. He\nlooked maybe sixty but heavily built, with a strong face, deeply lined, and a\nclose-cropped grey beard.\n“By the dead,” said Clover, finally placing him. “It’s the First o’ the\nMagi.”\n“None other.” The afternoon sun shone brightly off Bayaz’s tanned pate\nas he stepped forwards, took Clover’s right hand in both of his and pressed\nit warmly. “Welcome to the Great Northern Library, Jonas Steepfield. I\nunderstand there is no man alive who knows more about sword-work.”\nClover raised his brows. “That was a long time ago. Call myself Clover\nthese days.”\n“Ah. I fear I am out of date in all manner of ways.” And Bayaz smiled.\nA broad, white, beaming smile. His face lit up with friendly creases, but a\nhardness lingered around his eyes, deep-set and glistening green. Clover\ngrinned back, but the conclusion he’d come to in Currahome—that Bayaz\nwould be a bad enemy to have—was only reinforced. “The world moves\nalong so quickly one can scarcely keep up.”\n“That why you keep the young folk around?” asked Clover, watching\nthe blonde girl lick a finger and leaf frowning through one of the books.\n“What is the point of gathering knowledge if one does not pass it on?\nWhat is the point of growing old if one does not try to shape the future?”\n“That what you’re doing here? Shaping the future?”\n“Struggling to do so.” The wizard sighed. “I confess it has not been easy\nlately. People, Master Clover, make wretched building material.

        "text": "lately. People, Master Clover, make wretched building material. People and\ntheir restless whims, and their wilful intransigence, and their petty\nambitions.” Bayaz bared his teeth, and Clover had to fight a strange desire\nto back away. “They simply refuse to see what is best for them. Imagine\nbricks that pounce on every opportunity to defy the architect and run off\ntheir own way.”\n“Frustrating,” murmured Clover.\n“But I never stop trying. Doing better next time, after all, that’s what life\nis.”\n“I reckon.” Honestly, Clover was somewhat troubled by the tone, along\nwith the memory of Black Calder’s nervous hand-wringing around the man.\nBut then he’d been serving dangerous bastards all his life. A master no one\nfears won’t take you far, and men who make the worst enemies, after all,\ncan make the best friends. “I… er, have something for you.”\n“For me?” asked Bayaz.\n“Black Rikke didn’t want it, and I wouldn’t know what to do with it, but\nI thought…” And Clover drew out the chain that Stour Nightfall once wore,\nthat Scale Ironhand once wore, that Bethod once wore, gold gleaming in the\nafternoon sun. “Maybe you would.”\n“Why, Master Clover,” breathed Bayaz as he took it, eyes fixed on the\ndangling jewel. “A gift fit for a king indeed! I know just the place for it, in\ngood time.”\nClover humbly shrugged. He was out of friends. If this bought him a\nsafe place to sit, he’d consider it well worth the price. “Would’ve been poor\nmanners to turn up empty-handed.”\n“Oh, we are of one mind!” said Bayaz, clapping a palm down on his\nshoulder and leading him across the yard towards the library. “Manners\nmight be out of fashion in the North, but I want you to know that I\nappreciate them. Aided by people with good manners and good judgement,\nthere is nothing that cannot be achieved. This promising young lady, for\nexample, has but recently joined me.” Gesturing towards the blonde girl as\nthey passed. “She proves to have a humbling work ethic and a marvellous\nfacility with numbers, so I am teaching her the mysteries of finance.”\n“What’s that? A kind of magic?”\n“A very powerful kind. The magic of money. Which do you think rings\nbetter—Hildi dan Valint or Hildi dan Balk?”\n“What?”\n“Magic and money are two things I know a little about,” Bayaz was\nsaying as he slipped Bethod’s chain into a pocket. “Kings, also, are an area\nof some expertise. But I must confess that when it comes to sword-work, I\nhave always relied on others.”\n“Lucky for me, I guess. Who’s the student?”\nBayaz led him down a set of steps worn almost to a ramp by time,\nthrough a low archway and out onto a paved shelf on the mountainside. It\nhad only a crumbling wall for a parapet and a grand valley was spread out\nbeyond it, the lake stretching away like a grey mirror, forest and mountains\nreflected in its still surface.\nA black-haired boy stood at the brink, framed by the view, scarred"

He didn’t move a hair. Not a quiver. Like a boy carved\nfrom wood. Clover got the sense he’d been there, still, for a very long time.\n“I know this lad,” he murmured, though you might’ve called him a\nyoung man, now. “Black Calder had him around. Who is he?”\n“It is not so much who he is that interests me,” said Bayaz, “as who he\nmight become.”\n“Shaping the future, eh?”\n“Precisely so.” There were a few training posts set up about the little\nyard, and Bayaz rubbed thoughtfully at the deep blade-gnawing on the\nnearest one. “To my unpractised eye, he seems a more than passing\nswordsman already.”\n“I’ve seen him spar and never saw more promise at the business. The\ndead know I could use the work, but I’m not sure how much I’ve got to\nteach him.”\n“Oh, I think you know far more than you pretend to. I need him to learn\nnot only how to use the sword, but when. I want you to teach him the\nwarrior’s lessons that his half-brother refused to learn. This is Jonas\nClover!”\nThe lad slowly lowered the sword, and shook out his shoulders, and\nwiped sweat from his brow, and flicked it away, and finally looked over. “I\nremember.”\n“I have brought him here to teach you sword-work.”\nThe lad didn’t laugh, at least. Just gave Clover a long look with those\npale eyes, like he was the master and Clover the pupil he was thinking of\ntaking on.\n“I will leave the two of you to get acquainted.” Bayaz leaned close and\ngave Clover’s shoulder a parting pat. “Dinner in an hour.”\nThey stood there, in silence, for a while, and the wind came up from the\nvalley and stirred the grass in the cracks between the stones. Then Clover\nplanted his hands on his hips and grinned out towards the lake. “Quite the\nview. I could look at that all day.”\nThe lad didn’t speak.\nClover wandered to the wall of the library, so ancient and lichen-covered\nthat it looked to be one with the mountainside, put his back to it and slid\ndown till his arse hit the ground. “What should I call you?”\nThe lad shrugged.\n“You’ve got a scarred lip,” said Clover, settling himself back against the\nold stones, warm from a day in the sun. “I could call you shit-mouth. How\nabout that?”\nThe lad shrugged again.\n“I’m not really going to call you shit-mouth. That was a test.”\n“Did I pass?”\n“You did.”\n“I didn’t do anything.”\n“That’s why.”\nThe lad frowned down at him, sword hanging from his hand.\n“You look puzzled,” said Clover.\n“A warrior hits first,” said the lad, like they were words he’d learned by\nheart. “Hits hardest. A warrior has his sword always in his hand.”"

The swordsman’s greatest ambition, if you’re asking me, should be\nnot to join those heroes in the mud.”\n“We all meet the Great Leveller.”\n“’Course we do.” Clover sat forwards to shrug his cloak off, the\nwolfskin cloak Stour used to wear, a touch bedraggled now from hard use,\nand started rolling it up. “But I’d favour putting him off as long as possible.\nHow about you? Planning to rush at him, trousers down?”\nThe lad’s black brows drew in slightly as he thought about it.\n“In the end… the only thing a man can really do… is pick his moment.\nWatch for the opening, and recognise it when it comes, and seize it.” And\nClover snatched at a handful o’ nothing and shook his fist. “Picking your\nmoment. That’s the secret. You understand?”\nThe boy nodded, solemn as a grave-guest, and it seemed like all the\nwisdom Stour wouldn’t take in a hundred tellings this lad sucked straight up\nlike a sponge. “I think so.”\n“I think so, too. Now why don’t you show me your fearsome skills on\none o’ them posts?”\nClover shoved the roll he’d made of his cloak behind his head as a\npillow, and he crossed one boot over the other. He watched the lad’s sword\ndarting. He watched the blade flash and flicker. He watched the evening sun\ngleam on the lake.\n“That’s good!” he called. “That’s damn good. Pick your moment.” And\nClover gave a contented sigh, and closed his eyes. Listened to that bird\ntooting high above. Listened to the wind whispering in the grass. Listened\nto the click and scrape of steel on wood.\nCould’ve worked out worse, he supposed.\nA Little Private Hanging\nI\nt was a highly exclusive affair.\nNo carnival atmosphere.

They were gone the way of Risinau, and Judge, and the\nCommons’ Round, and the People’s Inspectorate, and the Great Change as a\nwhole. Just the gallows, and a rope, and a trapdoor, and a lever to open it.\nAnd a prisoner to hang, of course. It would be a hell of a poor occasion\nwithout one of those.\nA gentle breeze washed through the yard, hardly any smoke on the air,\nand it tasted sweet. Perhaps your last breaths always do. Orso wasn’t afraid.\nNot even watching the noose gently swing. But then he’d always had a\nhabit of being brave at the least appropriate times. He had blundered blindly\nfrom one mistake to another, buffeted by forces he had barely perceived, let\nalone understood, like a blind man in a prizefight. There was so much he\nhad failed at. So often he had disappointed. This, at least, he was\ndetermined to do well.\n“No point hanging around, is there?” he said, and he left the guards\nbehind him and trotted jauntily up the steps.\nHe had tried to do the right thing, he thought, in his own rather\nineffectual way, but it was strange how circumstances would rarely let one\nbe the hero, however much one might want to be. However much one might\ndeserve to be. Still, no doubt everyone thinks they are entitled to the prizes.\nThe Young Lion had no doubts about it, that was clear.\nHe still looked somewhat leonine, if you squinted, but young had\nbecome a hell of a stretch. There was a premature greying to that golden\nhair and beard. A leaching out of all his colour. He had an expression of\nwell-earned satisfaction as he watched Orso climb the scaffold. One might\nhave liked to blame it on a total lack of empathy or imagination, but the\ntruth, as everyone knew, was that Leo dan Brock knew exactly how it felt to\nface the noose.\nSome people, Orso supposed, can never forgive being forgiven.\nThe Lord Regent glanced sideways at his wife, like a winning squares\nplayer at their beaten opponent.\nBut Savine did not meet his eye. Most observers might have thought she\nwas relaxed, a wealthy patron in her box at the theatre. But Orso knew her\nbetter than that. Better than anyone, maybe. He saw the muscles of her jaw\nclenching. Her knuckles white with pressure on the rail. He knew at a\nglance this was as much of a shock to her as to anyone.\nHe smiled at her, and she smiled back. A small smile, at the corner of her\nmouth, but he saw it. He knew what it meant. Perhaps every person is\nalone, in the end. But in that moment, it seemed they understood each other.\nForgave each other. Loved each other still, perhaps, even now. He did not\nthink he had ever let her down.

Probably no better than the Closed\nCouncils of his father, of King Guslav, King Casamir, King Arnault, and all\nthe way back to the first Harod, namesake of the new.\n“I must admit it’s a rather disappointing turnout,” called Orso. “Still, I\nunderstand. I’ve always hated hangings myself. And here’s one I’m\nparticularly reluctant to attend!” He barked a laugh. No one joined him.\n“Dear me. Who would’ve thought I’d be the only one to keep my sense of\nhumour?”\nTricky, with his hands tied, but he managed to nudge the executioner in\nthe ribs with his elbow. “Lovely day for it, at least.” He squinted up at the\nblue sky. The few shreds of cloud, slowly shifting. “Looks like it’ll be a fine\nsummer.” It made him terribly sad, suddenly, to think he wouldn’t see it. He\ncovered it up with a chuckle. “For you, at least.”\nThe executioner, somewhat apologetically, offered him a hood.\n“Thank you, but no. I’ve attended a few of these things. Let’s not\npretend that’s for my benefit.” Damn, he wanted to scratch his nose, but his\nhands were tied behind his back. He wriggled it a little, but that only made\nit worse. Ridiculous, to die with an itchy nose. He raised his brows\nsignificantly. “I don’t suppose you could just—”\nThe executioner squinted through his eyeholes as he gently scratched the\nrim of Orso’s nostril.\n“Ah, that’s good. A little to the right… perfect.”\nThe man reached up, pulled down the noose, secured it around Orso’s\nneck.\n“Nice and tight, there’s a good fellow.” Orso winked at him. “So hard to\nfind a good valet these days.”\nThe Young Lion looked somewhat nettled. “Have you anything to say?”\nhe snapped."

No one? The truth is, at my best, I’ve been a barely adequate king.\nMy father’s son, I daresay. Though allow me to take just a little pride in my\nvictory against the odds at Stoffenbeck. Unfortunate timing, to take the\nthrone with not one but two bloody revolts on the way, but that’s no excuse,\nreally. There’s always something horrible on the way, after all. You’ll see.\nNot that I bear any of you ill will, you understand. Ill will is too heavy a\nthing to carry through life, let alone up onto a scaffold, and it’s useless in a\nfight in any case.”\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw the executioner wrap his hands\naround the lever.\n“Well! I think I’m being given the signal to finish up. To my sister,\nSavine…” He grinned over at her. The way he used to, when they were\ntogether, in Sworbreck’s office. When he had just thought of the best joke.\nOne he knew she would love. That was how he wanted her to think of him.\nAs he had been. As they had been. “I take some comfort in knowing you’ll\nbe a far better ruler than I ever was. We have had our differences, but you\nremain the woman I most admire. And, let’s be honest, the only one I’ve\never loved.” He was gratified to see a tear slide down her cheek. It was not\nas if it had all been worth it, for one tear, but it was something. He grinned\nat the Lord Regent. “To her husband, Leo dan Brock, I can only say…\nhow’s your leg?”\nHe gave one last chuckle, and it became a sigh. “Let’s get on with it,” he\nsaid.\nThere was a clatter as the trap dropped open.\nThe Villain\nL\neo had won.\nHe’d faced crushing defeats. He’d suffered terrible losses. But he’d won\na victory bigger than anyone could’ve believed. He sat at the head of the\nClosed Council. The most powerful man in the Union. In the Circle of the\nWorld, maybe. Who’d dare deny it?\nThe Burners had used the White Chamber as a stable. A little fuck\nyourself from Judge to the old regime which had left the place smelling\nfaintly of horse however thoroughly it was scrubbed. The table and chairs\nwere the same ones King Jezal’s Closed Council had used—as battered and\nscarred as Leo was—but he’d ordered them left in their places. A timely\nreminder to anyone he let sit in here that they could always be replaced.\nThe chosen few filed in respectfully.

Until he remembered everything he’d\nsacrificed to win. Everyone he’d sacrificed. He wished Antaup, and Jin, and\nBarniva, and Ritter were there, too. But wishing does no good.\nLord Admiral Heugen and Lord Chancellor Isher were the next to enter,\nsporting more gold thread between them than a set of palace curtains,\nuniforms as splendid as their military records were wretched. The best men\non the Open Council. Or at any rate the best runners.\nTwo bureaucrats followed. Victarine dan Teufel’s sudden disappearance\n—\nto the bottom of the canal, he hoped—had left the Arch Lector’s chair\nopen for Lorsen, Superior of Westport, who seemed a man untroubled by\nconscience. High Consul Flassenbeck was one of the few officials of the old\ngovernment lucky and cunning enough to tiptoe alive through the purges.\nThey were hardly the sort of men that Leo admired, but he supposed\nsomeone had to take care of the details, and luck, cunning and lack of\nconscience were certainly qualities his new Union would need.\nFinally came the four freshly minted Ministers. People who understood\nthe modern world, supposedly. Jurand had pleaded with Leo to give Savine\nthat much, and pointed out the magic she’d worked on the government of\nAngland, and in the end he’d grudgingly admitted it made sense. Inventors\nand industrialists in shiny civilian clothing and, at the back, having toned\ndown the bosom somewhat but still smelling strongly of roses, none other\nthan Selest dan Heugen. A woman in the White Chamber would’ve caused\nuproar a few years ago, but progress and all that. Leo saw no harm in\nhaving something ornamental to look at as long as she remembered her\nplace.\nHe winced as they grovelled their greetings and slipped into their seats.\nHe’d won. There was no denying it. But the stump of his leg hurt no less.\nHis metal-riddled arm felt no more. There was that same bitter tang in the\ngap in his teeth. His temper, if anything, was shorter than ever.\nHe’d won, but it was nothing like his victory over Stour Nightfall in the\nCircle. No adoration from the crowds, only fear and suspicion. No surge of\njoy, only a nagging dissatisfaction. No hugs from his friends. He’d led most\nof them to their deaths.\nHe was surprised when he heard the door shut and the Lady Regent\nglided in. She could barely stand to look at him these days, let alone spend\ntime in the same room. The way things were, he’d have been shocked if\nthey ever fucked again, but he didn’t miss it. Since he lost his leg it had\ngone from what felt like work to what felt like humiliation. She could keep\nher quim to herself, and he’d take everything else, and consider it a fair\ndivision of the assets.\n“Joining us, Your Highness?” he asked.\n“Since there is a seat free.” She calmly met his eye as she arranged\nherself with even more than usually regal bearing in the tall chair at the foot"

The one that for centuries had sat empty for the First of the\nMagi. “Not expecting Bayaz, are we?”\nThose might’ve been the first words they’d exchanged since the\nhanging. The slightest thaw in the winter of their marriage? Or more likely\nher ruthless, realistic self was worming its way back to the surface, and she\nwas making the best of what she couldn’t change. She’d always been a\nwoman who liked to win. But if she intended to fight him now, she’d better\nget used to the taste of dirt.\n“I think we’re all here.” Leo sat forwards, setting his clenched fist on the\ntable. “We have a new Closed Council. Young. Hungry. A dozen men—and\nwomen—ready to reforge the Union for a new age.”\nThere was polite applause. From everyone except Savine. She sat with\nthat icy dignity she specialised in, glaring down the long table at Leo as\nthough she could taste piss. But he wasn’t about to let her wounded fucking\nfeelings spoil his moment.\n“It grieves me to say that the nation is weak,” he growled, grinding his\nfist into the wood. “The rot was already setting in long before the Great\nChange. The army is in demoralised tatters. We have to give the men back\ntheir pride! Their purpose!”\nGlaward clapped his hands. “Well said, Your Highness.”\n“We could start by returning the Square of Marshals to its former glory.\nThose names underfoot are… an ugly reminder of things better forgotten.\nThe ruined flagstones must be replaced so we can have drills, parades,\nmanoeuvres, demonstrations of the Union’s strength—”\n“I feel that would be a mistake,” said Savine.\nLeo licked sourly at the hole in his teeth. “You shock me.”\n“It should remain the Square of Martyrs,” she said, holding his eye in a\nchallenge he did not at all appreciate. “If we sponge away the evidence of\nour failures, how are we ever to learn from them? We should leave the\nnames of those who died for the Great Change and add the names of those\nwho died in it. Let us commemorate the horrors of the old regime and the\nnew, in the hope that we shall never repeat them. We must have a better\nUnion.” Her knuckles were white as she clenched her own fist on the\ntabletop. “It cannot all be for nothing. It cannot.”\nThere was a thoughtful silence, then Curnsbick slowly nodded. “Very\nwell said, Your Highness.”\nLeo frowned sideways at Jurand. He was looking back earnestly, his\nbrow lightly wrinkled, like a puppy begging for a treat. The look he always\nused to have, when Leo’s mother voiced some guff that he agreed with.\n“Well.” Leo worked his mouth, then with an effort forced his lips into\nthe thinnest of smiles. “Far be it from me to deny the Darling of the Slums a\nsentimental gesture or two. Call the place whatever you like. The larger\npoint remains. We face threats on every border. Our fortresses are neglected"

The first order of business must be the\nreinforcement and renewal of the king’s military—”\n“The Lord Regent makes an excellent point,” interrupted Savine, “which\nis why our first order of business must be money. King Jezal’s\nadministration made many blunders, but their worst was spending what they\ndid not have.”\nEveryone turned to look at Leo. “We all know that,” he grunted. He\nneeded no lecture on not making the same mistake twice.\n“As a solid financial foundation we need a new system of taxation,” said\nSavine. “Minister for Revenue Vallimir?”\n“Sweeping reform, root and branch.” Vallimir began to hand out neatly\nbound sheaves of printed paper. Down at that end of the table, it seemed\nthey’d come armed. “You will see various proposals here. Increased levies\non land and wealth, abolition of privileged categories and venal offices,\ntariffs on mercantile and industrial activity, strong measures against\ncorruption.”\n“We cannot look back,” said Curnsbick, peering over his eye-lenses.\n“We must avoid the ruinous debts which poisoned King Jezal’s reign.”\n“The Great Change freed us from the tyranny of the banks, at least,”\nobserved Kort.\nIsher leafed through the papers with an ever-deeper frown. “Only to\nchain us all under the yoke of the tax collector?”\nThey began to argue, and tediously. Proportions, allowances,\nexemptions. Leo scarcely understood the issues. It almost made him wish\nhe’d paid closer attention to his mother during those boring meetings of his\ncouncil back in Angland. But not quite.\nHe sank into his chair, wishing he’d brought wine. He belonged in the\nsaddle. Or perhaps some kind of open carriage would be less painful? He\nbelonged near other men in the saddle, anyway. His eyes drifted sideways\nto Jurand. On campaign, with the wind behind them and an enemy in front,\ncalling for the charge with a sword in his hand!\n“We need money to rebuild,” Kort was saying.\n“To modernise,” said Curnsbick.\n“To mount a summer fencing Contest this year?” offered Selest. “A\nbeloved tradition to give the people inspiration, reassurance and common\npurpose.”\n“An excellent idea,” and Savine tapped the table approvingly with her\nfingertips.\nLeo smashed it with his fist, jerking the faces back towards him where\nthey belonged.\n“We need money for our forces! Cannons. Ships. What use is progress if\nit can’t be made into a weapon? Union arms must be respected again. We\nhave to strangle our enemies at sea and crush them on land. We need to be\nfeared.” Smashing the table had worked once so he did it again, even\nharder, making a heap of papers slump over in front of Kort. “We should\npress a claim on the city of Sipani.”\nThere was a nervous silence. The High Consul cleared his throat. “On\nwhat basis, Your Highness?”\n“You’ll think of something.”\nLoaded glances crossed the table. “But… Sipani has long been\nconsidered neutral.”"

        "text": "what basis, Your Highness?”\n“You’ll think of something.”\nLoaded glances crossed the table. “But… Sipani has long been\nconsidered neutral.”\n“The Snake of Talins once captured the city,” grumbled Lorsen, “but\neven\nshe did not presume to keep it. We would provoke a furious response\nfrom the Styrians—”\n“I’m bloody counting on it,” said Leo.\nGlaward and Heugen nodded along, but even Jurand didn’t look\nconvinced. He’d gone from the bloody begging look to the bloody pained\nlook. Next he’d be quoting Stolicus on the virtues of patience.\nSavine looked evenly at him down the table. “King Jezal fought three\nwars against the Styrians. All he achieved was to waste millions, kill\nthousands and pour the Union’s prestige down the sewer. We must\nmodernise our military, undoubtedly. We must protect our interests, of\ncourse. But we have far more to gain through trade with Styria than war. I\nsuggest we invite King Jappo on a state visit to Adua to discuss areas of\nmutual interest—”\n“What mutual interest could we have with that fucking degenerate?”\nsneered Leo.\n“Styria is a growing market,” observed Kort, jowls wobbling.\n“Tremendous opportunities,” burbled Curnsbick.\n“It could be… a pragmatic solution,” grated Arch Lector Lorsen.\nSavine shrugged. “Sometimes there are better ways to get what you\nwant than through force.”\nPerhaps there were, but Leo wasn’t interested in them, and he certainly\nwasn’t interested in wasting more breath on the subject. “Let’s put it to a\nvote,” he snapped. “Those in favour of laying claim to Sipani?”\nHe threw up a careless hand and arms shot up along with it. Jurand’s,\nGlaward’s, Lord Heugen’s… but that was all. Further down the table, no\none moved. Leo stared at them, unable to believe it. It was like Stoffenbeck\nall over again, looking out as the sun came up, sure of victory, and finding\nto his cold dismay the enemy had been reinforced.\nAs if to rub it in, Savine let the silence stretch a few more awkward\nmoments before she calmly spoke. “Those in favour of a state visit?”\nHands went up more slowly, but no less decisively, and there were a lot\nmore of them. It was no surprise that Savine’s four stooges might want to\nvote her way, but it was a shock they had the guts to do it. It was an even\nbigger one that Flassenbeck and Lorsen might dare to defy him, but Leo\nsupposed you should never trust bureaucrats, especially those who’ve\nsurvived purges. It was the final betrayal that truly beggared belief, though.\nLord Chancellor Isher, in the seat Leo had just given him, politely raised his\nbraid-heavy arm.\n“What do you think you’re doing?” whispered Leo.\nIsher cleared his throat. “Agreeing with Her Highness the Lady Regent,”\nhe droned, careful not to meet Leo’s eye. “We have far more to gain through\ntrade with Styria than war.”\nMeaning he had more to gain. Leo wanted to call him a backstabbing"

Leo wanted to call him a backstabbing\ncoward to his face, then demand to know what Savine had bribed him with,\nbut he was so flabbergasted he couldn’t find the breath. He looked across at\nJurand, and Jurand stared back, pale with shock. Evidently this was one\noutflanking that a careful study of Stolicus hadn’t prepared him for.\n“Eight to four in favour of a state visit,” said Savine, making a neat little\nnote. “High Consul Flassenbeck, would you summon the Styrian\nambassador so we can advance a formal invitation to King Jappo? Then\nLady Selest, could you liaise with my private secretary Zuri on an agenda\nfor the talks—”\n“What the fuck?” snarled Leo, spraying spit.\nAnother silence, even more awkward than the last. Savine went on\nwriting for a moment, then looked up from her papers. “Perhaps the Closed\nCouncil might give His Highness and I a moment to confer?”\nBy the speed they scrambled from their seats, they were desperate to do\nexactly that.\nWith one nervous backward glance, Selest dan Heugen pulled the door to\nthe White Chamber shut, leaving Savine alone with her husband.\nShe could not help shifting in that uncomfortable bloody chair at a\nsudden pang. With impeccable timing, her menses had come for the first\ntime since she fell pregnant and just as painfully as ever, the familiar dull\nache through her belly and down the backs of her thighs with an occasional\nsharp twinge into her arse by way of light relief. As she always used to, she\nstruggled with every muscle to look perfectly relaxed, and forced her\ngrimace into an expression of quiet dignity.\n“Do you think I’ll let you steal this from me?” whispered Leo, white\nwith fury.\nSavine had no doubt that he had become a very dangerous man. She\nremembered seeing him stab Lord Marshal Forest in the chest without a\nhint of hesitation. But she had faced dangerous men before. Preparation was\nthe key. That and never backing down.\n“Steal this? The Union, you mean?” Savine spoke slowly, precisely, like\na schoolteacher explaining arithmetic to a pupil prone to tantrums. Perhaps\nthat would only enrage him further. She rather hoped so. “It is not yours,\nLeo. It belongs to our son, the king. We are merely the caretakers. The joint\ncaretakers.”\nHe clawed at the table, catching some papers and crushing them in his\ntrembling fist. He might only have the one that worked, but she knew how\nstrong it still was. “Get out,” he snarled through gritted teeth.\nSavine set her jaw. “Let me be blunt. You will beat me in a foot race\nbefore you remove me from this chamber.”\n“I am in command here—”\n“Are you sure? I begin to think you did not read the Open Council’s\nGrand Declaration very carefully. I wrote it carefully, I promise you that. It\ngives me exactly the same rights, privileges and powers as you. Matters of\npolicy are decided by votes in this council and, as you see, the strong\nmajority are on my side.”"

The skull-like rings around his eyes reminded her more than was\ncomfortable of her father. But while her father had done awful things, he\nhad stopped short of having heroic paintings made of them. “We’ll see\nwhich way these bastards vote with drawn swords at their necks.”\nSavine narrowed her eyes. “You will beat me at left-handed darts before\nyou do that. You should know that I have made comprehensive\narrangements. Try to seize power and the coal will stop coming, and the\nbread will stop coming, and the money will stop coming. I’ll chain you up\nin strikes and riots. I’ll bury you in a blizzard of pamphlets. Have you seen\nhow popular I am these days? Threaten the Mother of the Nation? Depose\nthe Darling of the Slums? You’d have another Great Change on your hands,\nsupposing the army fought for you. But bear in mind, their oath isn’t to you,\nit’s to the king. And you are not king, Leo. You’re less king than I am.”\nThere was a brooding silence as they glared at one another down the\nlength of that battered table, in the dingy, stuffy, faintly horse-smelling\nroom that was the very pinnacle of power.\n“So you’ve stabbed me in the fucking back.” His voice had a wounded\nwhine to it. “My own wife. I should have left you to the Burners.”\nIt was his bad luck that this reinvention of the past coincided with a\nparticularly savage cramp, as if there was a fist clenching around her guts.\nShe jerked forwards, showing him her teeth. “You fucking did, you\ntreacherous shit! And then you seized the throne against my wishes, and\nthen you killed my brother, and now I’ll make you pay the fucking bill!”\nAs she snarled the words his expression changed from fury, to\namazement, and ended in a joyless bark of laughter. “Oh, so I’m the villain?\nFunny what we forget, isn’t it? Remember our rebellion? I wanted to\nchange the Closed Council but leave Orso on the throne! That’s what you\ntold me you wanted. And the Darling of the Slums wouldn’t lie to her own\nhusband, would she?”\nSavine swallowed, and said nothing.\nLeo stabbed with a finger at Isher’s empty chair. “Because the flexible\nLord Isher told me a different story. That you agreed with him Orso would\nbe quietly shuffled off, so you could be queen. And that wasn’t the only deal\nyou made behind my back, was it? I thought it was strange how Stour\njust…” And he snapped his fingers. “Changed his mind about helping\nus! No wonder, since you offered him Uffrith!”\nSavine had to stop herself grimacing.

Play the saint of Adua out there if you please,\nSavine,” he sneered at her, “but in here let’s not embarrass ourselves. You\ncan call me treacherous. Call me ruthless. But ask who I learned it from.”\nAnother brooding silence as they glowered at each other from the hard\nchairs to which their ambitions had swept them. Then, for once, Savine let\nher shoulders drop.\n“You’re right,” she said, wincing as she tried to press at her aching belly\nthrough her corset. He was right, after all. “Maybe… I came to regret the\nthings I had done, and so I hated to see you do the same. The truth is I\nplayed my part in it all. The lead role, even. I schemed and lied and\nbetrayed. And you are the one who has paid the price.

Every victory turns out to be just another kind\nof defeat?”\nHe looked so withered, so ruined, she was caught between disgust and\npity. She could not forgive him, but she knew she had helped make him\nwhat he was. For better or worse, they were shackled together. She put\naside her anger and gave a weary sigh.\n“This is not a victory or a defeat, Leo, it is a marriage.” Now she slipped\nthe box from her sleeve and took a pinch up one nostril. “I suggested to\nyou, before our wedding, that you should look on it as a business\nrelationship.” She smothered a sneeze. “I suggest you continue to do so.\nPartners need not see eye to eye on every point.

You might not be the villain but you’re for damn sure\nnot the hero.” She forced her shoulders back, and her smile back on.\n“Selest!”\nThe door opened a crack to show the well-powdered face of the new\nMinister for Commerce. “Your Highness?”\n“Bring the Closed Council back in.

But he was stitching it back together,\npatience, patience, and smiling as he worked. He put out his hands, and one\nfell on the head of a black-haired boy, and the other on the head of a\nblonde-haired girl.\nShe saw the girl become a laughing woman, flashing lenses on her eyes,\na tall hat perched on her golden curls, and the hat belched smoke, spat ash,\nblotted out the bleeding sun and cast the world into twilight. She blew a\nkiss, and the kiss became a coin, a thousand coins, a million golden chains.\nShe offered her hand, and the fingers became iron rails, and the rails\nreached across the sea and made a cage, the cage that Stour had forged, and\nthe whole North was inside.\nShe saw the black-haired boy became a black-haired man, and he sat on\na hill of bones in a circle of fire with a grey sword across his knees, a grey\nsword never sheathed, a grey sword marked with one silver letter. His\nscarred mouth spoke, but his words were drops of blood that made a stream,\nthat became a river, that became a sea that broke upon the beaches of the\nNorth. A tide of blood. A flood whose red waters would not recede.\nShe saw the Crinna boil. She saw Uffrith burn again. She saw the graves\nopen and spew up the dead. She saw Skarling’s Chair split in two and the\nbroken wood bleeding. She saw a plague of worms writhe in the poisoned\nfields. She saw a plague of crows shower from the bare trees and blot out\nthe moon, sink the world in darkness.\nAnd in the darkness she saw a bald weaver, and in his eye she saw a\nburning stone, and in the burning stone she saw a circle of runes, and in the"

        "text": "the moon, sink the world in darkness.\nAnd in the darkness she saw a bald weaver, and in his eye she saw a\nburning stone, and in the burning stone she saw a circle of runes, and in the\ncircle of runes she saw a black door, and beyond the door a figure rose from\nthe seething sea, a figure made of blinding light, and his feet left\nsmouldering footsteps in the shingle, and he spoke in thunder.\n“I am returned.”\nRikke tore free of the furs on her father’s bed and crouched in the\ndarkness, trembling, gasping, the sweat of her vision clinging cold to her\nand her left eye burning hot as a coal in her tattooed face.\nShe couldn’t say whether the Long Eye was a blessing for giving her\nthis warning, or a curse that she would wake every day in terror of what\nshe’d seen.\nMaybe the truth was it was both. It had always been both.\n“You look like you saw the dead,” said Isern-i-Phail, frowning at her as she\ndropped into Skarling’s Chair.\n“I did,” whispered Rikke. The light from the great new windows she’d\nhad built, with their fine view of the ocean, stabbed at her eyes. The sounds\nof Uffrith beyond hammered at her ears. Flashes of what she’d seen the\nnight before lurked at the edges of her sight. Seen as if they were already\ndone. She closed her eyes, the one that saw nothing and the one that saw too\nmuch, and wiped the greasy sheen from her forehead.\nHer father’s hall was busy. Folk from every corner of the North, come to\npay their respects.\n“People,” she said, but her voice died in her throat and became a croak.\n“People!” And they stopped their chatter and looked around, shifting\neagerly towards her. “In the night, I had a vision!”\nThere was a hushed murmur at that. An awestruck murmur, like she\nspoke with the voice of Euz.\nShivers frowned at her, his metal eye twinkling. “What did you see?”\nRikke hardly knew how to start. Her heart was thumping at the\nsplintered memories of it. She opened her mouth to speak—\nThen the doors to the hall shuddered open and the Nail stomped in out\nof the brightness, with a new cut down his cheek which rather suited him\nand a great smile on his face which suited him even better. “Ollensand\nsurrendered!”\n“You beat ’em?” asked Hardbread.\n“Didn’t have to,” said the Nail, slapping him on the shoulder with one\nbig hand and near knocking him down. “They opened their gates to us. And\nwe were gentle with ’em, don’t worry! All we took was their promise to\nkneel and pay their tithes to Black Rikke.” He gave a shrug. “Well, that and\none other thing freely given…” And he waved towards the door, and a set of\nCarls came in, each rolling a great cask ahead of him. “A dozen barrels of\ntheir best ale so we could toast the new North!”\nAnd they hefted one of the barrels onto the table while folk whooped\nand cheered and one of ’em banged the peg out with his axe and sent a jet"

Reckon it’ll be a good few years ’fore\nthose bones-and-hides bastards dare to stick a toe on our side o’ the river.”\nMore cheers, and more ale, and more good news. “The North’s ours!”\nroared the Nail. “Well, yours.” And he grinned at Rikke, then it seemed as if\nhe might be blushing, and he scratched his sandy beard, and looked down at\nthe floor. No one much noticed, though, all too busy slapping each other on\nthe back, and marvelling at how everything had come out right.\nThey all looked so happy. Faces Rikke was used to seeing stamped with\nfear or sadness. One old bird who’d lost two sons in the last war had tears\non her cheeks. Even Caul Shivers was smiling.\n“The North’s united,” he whispered, like it was a puzzle he couldn’t\nsolve. “From the Crinna to the Whiteflow. By the dead, your father would\nbe proud.”\nRikke thought of her father, then, sitting on his bench, rubbing his\ngrizzled jaw. Making the hard choices so his people wouldn’t have the\ntrouble of ’em. Bent under a load of other folk’s fears so they wouldn’t have\nto carry their weight.\nIsern-i-Phail was showing her missing tooth in a girlish grin. “Always\nknew we’d get great things from you, Rikke. But I’ll confess I never\nexpected half o’ this. Not a quarter. Now then.” And she offered out a\nchagga pellet. “What was this vision o’ yours?”\nRikke blinked at her, and at the happy room. Then she took the pellet,\nand stuck it up behind her lip. She forced a queasy smile onto her face.\n“Nothing,” she said. “All good.”\nAcknowledgments\nAs always, four people without whom:\nBren Abercrombie, whose eyes are sore from reading it.\nNick Abercrombie, whose ears are sore from hearing about it.\nRob Abercrombie, whose fingers are sore from turning the pages.\nLou Abercrombie, whose arms are sore from holding me up.\nThen, my heartfelt thanks:\nTo all the lovely and talented people in British publishing who have helped\nbring the First Law books to readers down the years, including but by no\nmeans limited to Simon Spanton, Jon Weir, Jen McMenemy, Mark Stay, Jon\nWood, Malcolm Edwards, David Shelley, Katie Espiner and Sarah Benton.\nThen, of course, all those who’ve helped make, publish, publicise, translate\nand above all sell my books wherever they may be around the world.\nTo the artists responsible for somehow continuing to make me look classy:"
