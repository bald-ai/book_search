The windows were open in the dining room, and the onset of\nevening brought a breeze off the waterfront to cool the diners, but in the\nkitchen, there were only the two ceiling fans that had been spinning all day to\nlittle effect. Summer had barely begun and already the city of Janloon was\nlike a spent lover—sticky and fragrant.\nBero and Sampa were sixteen years old, and after three weeks of\nplanning, they had decided that tonight would change their lives. Bero wore a\nwaiter’s dark pants and a white shirt that clung uncomfortably to his back.\nHis sallow face and chapped lips were stiff from holding in his thoughts. He\ncarried a tray of dirty drink glasses over to the kitchen sink and set it down,\nthen wiped his hands on a dish towel and leaned toward his coconspirator,\nwho was rinsing dishes with the spray hose before stacking them in the\ndrying racks.\n“He’s alone now.” Bero kept his voice low.\nSampa glanced up. He was an Abukei teenager—copper-skinned with\nthick, wiry hair and slightly pudgy cheeks that gave him a faintly cherubic\nappearance. He blinked rapidly, then turned back to the sink. “I get off my\nshift in five minutes.”\n“We gotta do it now, keke,” said Bero. “Hand it over.”\nSampa dried a hand on the front of his shirt and pulled a small paper\nenvelope from his pocket. He slipped it quickly into Bero’s palm. Bero\ntucked his hand under his apron, picked up his empty tray, and walked out of\nthe kitchen.\nAt the bar, he asked the bartender for rum with chili and lime on the rocks"

Bero carried the drink away, then put\ndown his tray and bent over an empty table by the wall, his back to the dining\nroom floor. As he pretended to wipe down the table with his towel, he\nemptied the contents of the paper packet into the glass. They fizzed quickly\nand dissolved in the amber liquid.\nHe straightened and made his way over to the bar table in the corner. Shon\nJu was still sitting by himself, his bulk squeezed onto a small chair. Earlier in\nthe evening, Maik Kehn had been at the table as well, but to Bero’s great\nrelief, he’d left to rejoin his brother in a booth on the other side of the room.\nBero set the glass down in front of Shon. “On the house, Shon-jen.”\nShon took the drink, nodding sleepily without looking up. He was a\nregular at the Twice Lucky and drank heavily. The bald spot in the center of\nhis head was pink under the dining room lights. Bero’s eyes were drawn,\nirresistibly, farther down, to the three green studs in the man’s left ear.\nHe walked away before he could be caught staring. It was ridiculous that\nsuch a corpulent, aging drunk was a Green Bone. True, Shon had only a little\njade on him, but unimpressive as he was, sooner or later someone would take\nit, along with his life perhaps. And why not me? Bero thought. Why not,\nindeed. He might only be a dockworker’s bastard who would never have a\nmartial education at Wie Lon Temple School or Kaul Dushuron Academy,\nbut at least he was Kekonese all the way through. He had guts and nerve; he\nhad what it took to be somebody. Jade made you somebody.\nHe passed the Maik brothers sitting together in a booth with a third young\nman. Bero slowed a little, just to get a closer look at them. Maik Kehn and\nMaik Tar—now they were real Green Bones. Sinewy men, their fingers\nheavy with jade rings, fighting talon knives with jade-inlaid hilts strapped to\ntheir waists. They were dressed well: dark, collared shirts and tailored tan\njackets, shiny black shoes, billed hats. The Maiks were well-known members\nof the No Peak clan, which controlled most of the neighborhoods on this side\nof the city. One of them glanced in Bero’s direction.\nBero turned away quickly, busying himself with clearing dishes. The last\nthing he wanted was for the Maik brothers to pay any attention to him\ntonight. He resisted the urge to reach down to check the small-caliber pistol\ntucked in the pocket of his pants and concealed by his apron. Patience. After\ntonight, he wouldn’t be in this waiter’s uniform anymore. He wouldn’t have\nto serve anyone anymore.\nBack in the kitchen, Sampa had finished his shift for the evening and was\nsigning out. He looked questioningly at Bero, who nodded that the deed was\ndone. Sampa’s small, white upper teeth popped into view and crushed down"

        "text": "signing out. He looked questioningly at Bero, who nodded that the deed was\ndone. Sampa’s small, white upper teeth popped into view and crushed down\non his lower lip. “You really think we can do this?” he whispered.\nBero brought his face near the other boy’s. “Stay cut, keke,” he hissed.\n“We’re already doing it. No turning back. You’ve got to do your part!”\n“I know, keke, I know. I will.” Sampa gave him a hurt and sour look.\n“Think of the money,” Bero suggested, and gave him a shove. “Now get\ngoing.”\nSampa cast a final nervous glance backward, then pushed out the kitchen\ndoor. Bero glared after him, wishing for the hundredth time that he didn’t\nneed such a doughy and insipid partner. But there was no getting around it—\nonly a full-blooded Abukei native, immune to jade, could palm a gem and\nwalk out of a crowded restaurant without giving himself away.\nIt had taken some convincing to bring Sampa on board. Like many in his\ntribe, the boy gambled on the river, spending his weekends diving for jade\nrunoff that escaped the mines far upstream. It was dangerous—when glutted\nwith rainfall, the torrent carried away more than a few unfortunate divers, and\neven if you were lucky and found jade (Sampa had bragged that he’d once\nfound a piece the size of a fist), you might get caught. Spend time in jail if\nyou were lucky, time in the hospital if you weren’t.\nIt was a loser’s game, Bero had insisted to him. Why fish for raw jade just\nto sell it to the black market middlemen who carved it up and smuggled it off\nisland, paying you only a fraction of what they sold it for later? A couple of\nclever, daring fellows like them—they could do better. If you were going to\ngamble for jade, Bero said, then gamble big. Aftermarket gems, cut and set—\nthat was worth real money.\nBero returned to the dining room and busied himself clearing and setting\ntables, glancing at the clock every few minutes. He could ditch Sampa later,\nafter he’d gotten what he needed.\n“Shon Ju says there’s been trouble in the Armpit,” said Maik Kehn, leaning\nin to speak discreetly under the blanket of background noise. “A bunch of\nkids shaking down businesses.”\nHis younger brother, Maik Tar, reached across the table with his\nchopsticks to pluck at the plate of crispy squid balls. “What kind of kids are\nwe talking about?”\n“Low-level Fingers. Young toughs with no more than a piece or two of\njade.”\nThe third man at the table wore an uncharacteristically pensive frown.\n“Even the littlest Fingers are clan soldiers. They take orders from their Fists,\nand Fists from their Horn.” The Armpit district had always been disputed\nterritory, but directly threatening establishments affiliated with the No Peak\nclan was too bold to be the work of careless hoodlums. “It smells like\nsomeone’s pissing on us.”\nThe Maiks glanced at him, then at each other. “What’s going on, Hilo-\njen?” asked Kehn. “You seem out of sorts tonight.”"

The pallid\nteenager kept his eyes down as he served them. He glanced up at Hilo for a\nsecond but didn’t seem to recognize him; few people who hadn’t met Kaul\nHiloshudon in person expected him to look as young as he did. The Horn of\nthe No Peak clan, second only in authority to his elder brother, often went\ninitially unnoticed in public. Sometimes this galled Hilo; sometimes he found\nit useful.\n“Another strange thing,” said Kehn when the waiter had left. “No one’s\nseen or heard from Three-Fingered Gee.”\n“How’s it possible to lose track of Three-Fingered Gee?” Tar wondered.\nThe black market jade carver was as recognizable for his girth as he was for\nhis deformity.\n“Maybe he got out of the business.”\nTar snickered. “Only one way anyone gets out of the jade business.”\nA voice spoke up near Hilo’s ear. “Kaul-jen, how are you this evening? Is\neverything to your satisfaction tonight?” Mr. Une had appeared beside their\ntable and was smiling the anxious, solicitous smile he always reserved for\nthem.\n“It’s all excellent, as usual,” Hilo said, arranging his face into the relaxed,\nlopsided smile that was his more typical expression.\nThe owner of the Twice Lucky clasped his kitchen-scarred hands together,\nnodding and smiling his humble thanks. Mr. Une was a man in his sixties,\nbald and well-padded, and a third-generation restaurateur. His grandfather\nhad founded the venerable old establishment, and his father had kept it\nrunning all through the wartime years, and afterward. Like his predecessors,\nMr. Une was a loyal Lantern Man in the No Peak clan. Every time Hilo was\nin, he came around personally to pay his respects. “Please let me know if\nthere is anything else I can have brought out to you,” he insisted.\nWhen the reassured Mr. Une had departed, Hilo grew serious again. “Ask\naround some more. Find out what happened to Gee.”\n“Why do we care about Gee?” Kehn asked, not in an impertinent way, just\ncurious. “Good riddance to him. One less carver sneaking our jade out to\nweaklings and foreigners.”\n“It bothers me, is all.” Hilo sat forward, helping himself to the last crispy\nsquid ball. “Nothing good’s coming, when the dogs start disappearing from\nthe streets.”\nBero’s nerves were beginning to fray. Shon Ju had nearly drained his tainted\ndrink. The drug was supposedly tasteless and odorless, but what if Shon, with\nthe enhanced senses of a Green Bone, could detect it somehow?

What if Sampa lost his nerve after all? The spoon in Bero’s\nhands trembled as he set it down on the table. Stay cut, now. Be a man.\nA phonograph in the corner wheezed out a slow, romantic opera tune,\nbarely audible through the unceasing chatter of people. Cigarette smoke and\nspicy food aromas hung languid over red tablecloths.\nShon Ju swayed hastily to his feet. He staggered toward the back of the\nrestaurant and pushed through the door to the men’s room.\nBero counted ten slow seconds in his head, then put the tray down and\nfollowed casually. As he slipped into the restroom, he slid his hand into his\npocket and closed it around the grip of the tiny pistol. He shut and locked the\ndoor behind him and pressed against the far wall.\nThe sound of sustained retching issued from one of the stalls, and Bero\nnearly gagged on the nauseating odor of booze-soaked vomit. The toilet\nflushed, and the heaving noises ceased. There was a muffled thud, like the\nsound of something heavy hitting the tile floor, then a sickly silence. Bero\ntook several steps forward. His heartbeat thundered in his ears. He raised the\nsmall gun to chest level.\nThe stall door was open. Shon Ju’s large bulk was slumped inside, limbs\nsprawled. His chest rose and fell in soft, snuffling snores. A thin line of drool\nran from the corner of his mouth.\nA pair of grimy canvas shoes moved in the far stall, and Sampa stuck his\nhead around the corner where he’d been lying in wait. His eyes grew round at\nthe sight of the pistol, but he sidled over next to Bero and the two of them\nstared down at the unconscious man.\nHoly shit, it worked.\n“What’re you waiting for?” Bero waved the small gun in Shon’s direction.\n“Go on! Get it!”\nSampa squeezed hesitantly through the half-open stall door. Shon Ju’s\nhead was leaning to the left, his jade-studded ear trapped against the wall of\nthe toilet cubicle. With the screwed-up face of someone about to touch a live\npower line, the boy placed his hands on either side of Shon’s head. He\npaused; the man didn’t stir. Sampa turned the slack-jowled face to the other\nside. With shaking fingers, he pinched the first jade earring and worked the\nbacking free.\n“Here, use this.” Bero handed him the empty paper packet. Sampa\ndropped the jade stud into it and got to work removing the second earring.\nBero’s eyes danced between the jade, Shon Ju, the gun, Sampa, again the\njade. He took a step forward and held the barrel of the pistol a few inches\nfrom the prone man’s temple. It looked distressingly compact and ineffective\n—a commoner’s weapon. No matter. Shon Ju wasn’t going to be able to Steel\nor Deflect anything in his state. Sampa would palm the jade and walk out the\nback door with no one the wiser. Bero would finish his shift and meet up with"

No one would disturb old Shon Ju for hours; it wasn’t the\nfirst time the man had passed out drunk in a restroom.\n“Hurry it up,” Bero said.\nSampa had two of the jade stones off and was working on the third. His\nfingers dug around in the fold of the man’s fleshy ear. “I can’t get this one\noff.”\n“Pull it off, just pull it off!”\nSampa gave the last stubborn earring a swift yank. It tore free from the\nflesh that had grown around it. Shon Ju jerked. His eyes flew open.\n“Oh shit,” said Sampa.\nWith an almighty howl, Shon’s arms shot out, flailing around his head and\nknocking Bero’s arm upward just as Bero pulled the trigger of the gun. The\nshot deafened all of them but went wide, punching into the plaster ceiling.\nSampa scrambled to get away, nearly tripping over Shon as he lunged for\nthe stall door. Shon flung his arms around one of the boy’s legs. His\nbloodshot eyes rolled in disorientation and rage. Sampa tumbled to the\nground and put his hands out to break his fall; the paper packet jumped from\nhis grasp and skittered across the tile floor between Bero’s legs.\n“Thieves!” Shon Ju’s snarling mouth formed the word, but Bero did not\nhear it. His head was ringing from the gunshot, and everything was\nhappening as if in a soundless chamber. He stared as the red-faced Green\nBone dragged at the terrified Abukei boy like a grasping demon from a pit.\nBero bent, snatched the crumpled paper envelope, and ran for the door.\nHe forgot he’d locked it. For a second he pushed and pulled in stupid\npanic, before turning the bolt and pounding out of the room. The diners had\nheard the gunshot, and dozens of shocked faces were turned toward him.\nBero had just enough presence of mind left to jam the gun into his pocket and\npoint a finger back toward the restroom. “There’s a jade thief in there!” he\nshouted.\nThen he ran across the dining room floor, weaving between tables, the\ntwo small stones digging through the paper and against the palm of his tightly\nfisted left hand. People leapt away from him. Faces blurred past. Bero\nknocked over a chair, fell, picked himself up again, and kept running.\nHis face was burning. A sudden surge of heat and energy unlike anything\nhe had ever felt before ripped through him like an electric current. He reached\nthe wide, curving staircase that led to the second floor, where diners were\ngetting up and peering over the balcony railing to see what the commotion\nwas. Bero rushed up the stairs, clearing the entire expanse in a few bounds,\nhis feet barely touching the floor. A gasp ran through the crowd. Bero’s\nsurprise burst into ecstasy.

The scrape of chair legs, the\ncrash of a plate, the taste of the air on his tongue—everything was razor\nsharp. Someone reached out to grab him, but he was so slow, and Bero was\nso fast. He swerved with ease and leapt off the surface of a table, scattering\ndishes and eliciting screams. There was a sliding screen door ahead of him\nthat led out onto the patio overlooking the harbor. Without thinking, without\npausing, he crashed through the barrier like a charging bull. The wooden\nlatticework shattered, and Bero stumbled through the body-sized hole he had\nmade with a mad shout of exultation. He felt no pain at all, only a wild, fierce\ninvincibility.\nThis was the power of jade.\nThe night air blasted him, tingling against his skin. Below, the expanse of\ngleaming water beckoned irresistibly. Waves of delicious heat seemed to be\ncoursing through Bero’s veins. The ocean looked so cool, so refreshing. It\nwould feel so good. He flew toward the patio railing.\nHands clamped onto his shoulders and pulled him to a hard stop. Bero\nwas yanked back as if he’d reached the end of a chain and spun around to\nface Maik Tar.\nCHAPTER\n2\nThe Horn of No Peak\nT\nhe muffled gunshot went off on the other side of the dining room. A\nsecond or two later, Hilo felt it: the sudden shriek in his mind of an\nuncontrolled jade aura, as grating as a fork being dragged across glass. Kehn\nand Tar turned in their seats as the teenage waiter burst from the restroom and\nran for the stairs.\n“Tar,” said Hilo, but there was no need; both the Maiks were already\nmoving. Kehn went into the restroom; Tar leapt to the top of the stairs,\ncaught the thief on the patio, and threw him bodily back through the broken\nscreen door. A collective gasp and a number of screams broke out from the\ndiners as the boy came flying back inside, hit the ground, and skidded to the\ntop of the staircase.\nTar stepped into the building after him, stooping to clear the wreckage of\nthe entryway. Before the boy could scramble to his feet, Tar palmed his head\nand forced it to the floor. The thief reached for a weapon, a small gun, but\nTar tore it from him and flung it through the broken patio door and into the\nharbor. The boy gave a carpet-muffled cry as the Green Bone’s knee ground\ndown on his forearm and the paper packet was ripped from his white-\nknuckled grip. All this occurred so fast most of the onlookers did not see it.\nTar stood up, the teenager at his feet spasming and moaning as the\njangling jade energy crashed out of his body, taking with it the angry buzz in\nHilo’s skull. The younger Maik hauled the thief to his feet by the back of his\nwaiter’s shirt and dragged him back down the staircase to the main floor.

He pushed the boy to his knees, and Tar deposited the thief next to\nhim.\nShon Judonrhu wobbled forward after Kehn, steadying himself on the\nbacks of the chairs he passed. He didn’t look entirely sure of where he was or\nhow he had gotten there, but he was lucid enough to be enraged. His\nunfocused eyes bugged out from his skull. One hand was clapped to his ear.\n“Thieves,” he slurred. Shon reached for the hilt of the talon knife sheathed in\na shoulder holster under his jacket. “I’m going to gut them both.”\nMr. Une ran up, waving his arms in protest. “Shon-jen, I beg you, please,\nnot in the dining room!” He held his shaking hands out in front of him, his\njowly face white with disbelief. It was terrible enough that the Twice Lucky\nhad been shamed, that the restaurant’s kitchen had harbored jade thieves, but\nfor the two boys to be publicly slain right next to the buffet dessert table—no\nbusiness could survive the stain of such bad luck. The restaurant owner cast a\nfearful glance at Shon Ju’s weapon, then at the Maik brothers and the\nsurrounding stares of frozen customers. His mouth worked. “This is a terrible\noutrage, but, gentlemen, please—”\n“Mr. Une!” Hilo got up from his table. “I didn’t realize you’d added live\nentertainment.” All eyes turned as Hilo crossed the room. He felt a stir of\nunderstanding go through the crowd. The nearest diners noticed what Bero, in\nhis initial cursory glance, had not: Underneath Kaul Hilo’s smoke-colored\nsport jacket and the unfastened top two buttons of his baby-blue shirt, a long\nline of small jade stones was embedded in the skin of his collarbone like a\nnecklace fused into his flesh.\nMr. Une rushed over and walked alongside Hilo, wringing his hands.\n“Kaul-jen, I couldn’t be more embarrassed that your evening was disturbed. I\ndon’t know how these two worthless little thieving shits wormed their way\ninto my kitchen. Is there anything I could do to make it up to you? Anything\nat all. As much food and drink as you could want, of course …”\n“These things happen.” Hilo offered up a disarming smile, but the\nrestaurateur did not relax. If anything, he looked even more nervous as he\nnodded and wiped at his damp brow.\nHilo said, “Put away your talon knife, Uncle Ju. Mr. Une has enough to\nclean up already without blood in the carpet. And I’m sure all these people\nwho are paying for a nice dinner don’t want their appetites ruined.”\nShon Ju hesitated. Hilo had called him uncle, shown him respect despite\nhis obvious public humiliation. That was not, apparently, enough to mollify\nhim. He jabbed the blade in Bero and Sampa’s direction. “They’re jade\nthieves!

I like it when Kehn and Tar have a reason to stay on their\ntoes.” He winked at the two brothers as if sharing a schoolyard joke, but\nwhen he turned back to Shon Ju, his face was devoid of humor. “Perhaps,\nUncle,” he said, “it’s time to be drinking a little less and watching your jade a\nlittle more.”\nShon Ju clutched the returned gemstones, bringing his fist close to his\nchest in a spasm of relief. His thick neck flushed red with indignity, but he\nsaid nothing further. Even in his bleary, half-drugged state, the man wasn’t\nstupid; he understood he’d been given a warning, and after his pitiful lapse\ntonight, he remained a Green Bone only on account of Kaul Hilo’s say-so. He\nbacked away in a cowed stoop.\nHilo turned and waved his arms to the transfixed crowd. “Show’s over,\neveryone. No charge for the entertainment tonight. Let’s order some more of\nMr. Une’s delicious food, and another round of drinks!”\nA nervous ripple of laughter traveled through the dining room as people\nobeyed, turning back to their meals and companions, though they kept\nstealing glances at Kaul Hilo, the Maiks, and the two sorry teens on the floor.\nIt wasn’t especially often that ordinary, jadeless citizens were witness to such\na dramatic display of Green Bone abilities. They would go home and tell\ntheir friends about what they’d seen: how the thief had moved faster than any\nnormal human being and plowed through a wooden door, how much faster\nand stronger still the Maik brothers were in comparison, and how even they\ndeferred to the young Horn.\nKehn and Tar lifted the thieves and carried them out of the building.\nHilo began to follow, Mr. Une still scurrying along beside him,\nstammering quietly, “Once again, I beg your forgiveness. I screen all my\nwaitstaff carefully; I had no idea …”\nHilo put a hand on the man’s shoulder. “It’s not your fault; you can’t\nalways tell which ones will catch jade fever and go bad. We’ll take care of it"

We’ll take care of it\noutside.”\nMr. Une nodded in vigorous relief. He wore the expression of someone\nwho’d nearly been hit by a bus only to have it swerve out of the way and drop\na suitcase of money at his feet. If Hilo and the Maiks had not been present\ntonight, he would have had two dead boys and one very angry, drunken\nGreen Bone on his hands. With the Horn’s public endorsement, however, the\nTwice Lucky had escaped being disastrously tainted and instead gained\nrespect. Word of tonight’s events would spread, and the publicity would keep\nthe restaurant busy for some time.\nThe thought made Hilo feel better. The Twice Lucky wasn’t the only No\nPeak business in the neighborhood, but it was one of the largest and most\nprofitable; the clan needed its tribute money. Even more importantly, No\nPeak couldn’t afford the loss of face if the place failed or was taken over. If a\nloyal Lantern Man like Mr. Une lost his livelihood or his life, the\nresponsibility would fall on Hilo.\nHe trusted Mr. Une, but people were people. They sided with the\npowerful. The Twice Lucky might be a No Peak establishment today, but if\nthe worst came to pass and the owner was forced to switch allegiance in\nexchange for keeping his family business and his head on his shoulders, Hilo\nheld little illusion as to what choice he would make. Lantern Men were\njadeless civilians after all; they were part of the clan and crucial to its\nworkings, but they would not die for it. They were not Green Bones.\nHilo paused and pointed up at the destroyed screen door. “Send me the\nbill for the damage. I’ll take care of it.”\nMr. Une blinked, then clasped his hands together and touched them to his\nforehead several times in respectful gratitude. “You are too generous, Kaul-\njen. That’s not necessary …”\n“Don’t be silly,” said Hilo. He faced the man. “Tell me, my friend. Have\nyou had any other trouble around here lately?”\nThe restaurant owner’s eyes jumped around before landing nervously\nback on Hilo’s face. “What sort of trouble, Kaul-jen?”\n“Green Bones from other clans,” Hilo said. “That sort of trouble.”\nMr. Une hesitated, then drew Hilo aside and lowered his voice. “Not here\nin the Docks, not yet. But a friend of my nephew, he works as a bartender at\nthe Dancing Girl, over in the Armpit district. He says he’s seen men from the\nMountain clan coming in almost every night, sitting down where they please\nand expecting their drinks to be free. They’re saying it’s part of their tribute,\nand that the Armpit is Mountain territory.” Mr. Une took a sudden step back,\nunnerved by the expression on Hilo’s face. “It might be nothing more than\ntalk, but since you asked …”\nHilo patted the man’s arm. “Talk is never just talk. Let us know if you\nhear anything else, won’t you? You call if you ever need to.”\n“Of course. Of course I will, Kaul-jen,” said Mr. Une, touching his hands"

Of course I will, Kaul-jen,” said Mr. Une, touching his hands\nto his forehead once more.\nHilo gave the man a final, firm pat on the shoulder and left the restaurant.\nOutside, Hilo paused to pull a packet of cigarettes from his pocket. They\nwere expensive Espenian cigarettes; he had a weakness for them. He put one\nin his mouth and looked around. “How about over there,” he suggested.\nThe Maik brothers hauled the teenagers away from the Twice Lucky and\npushed them down the gravel slope to the edge of the water, out of sight from\nthe road. The pudgy Abukei boy cried and struggled the whole way; the other\none was limp and silent. The Maiks threw the thieves to the ground and\nbegan to beat them. Heavy, rhythmic blows to the torso, pounding the ribs,\nstomach, and back. Smacks to the face until the boys’ features were swollen\nalmost beyond recognition. No strikes to the vital organs, the throat, or the\nback of the skull. Kehn and Tar were good Fists; they were not careless and\nwould not be carried away by bloodlust.\nHilo smoked a cigarette and watched.\nNight had fallen completely now, but it was not dark. Streetlights blazed\nall along the waterfront, and the headlights of cars driving by bathed the road\nin pulses of white. Far out on the water, the slowly traveling lights of\nshipping vessels were smeared into blotches by sea fog and the haze of\npollution from the city. The air was warm and heavy with fumes, the\nsweetness of overripe fruit, and the stink of nine hundred thousand perspiring\ninhabitants.\nHilo was twenty-seven years old, but even he remembered a time when\ncars and televisions were a new thing in Janloon. Now they were everywhere,\nalong with more people, new factories, foreign-influenced street foods like\ntempura meatballs and spicy cheese curd. The metropolis strained at its seams\nand it felt as if all the people, Green Bones as well, strained with it. There\nwas an undercurrent, Hilo thought, of everything running a bit too\ndangerously fast all the time, as if the city were an oily new machine cranked\nto its highest setting, teetering just on the edge of out of control, disrupting\nthe natural order of things. What was the world coming to, that a couple of\nclumsy, untrained dock brats could figure on stealing jade off a Green Bone\n—and nearly succeed?\nIn truth, it would serve Shon Judonrhu right to lose his jade. Hilo could\nhave claimed the three studs for himself as justifiable punishment for Shon’s\nineptitude. He’d been tempted, certainly, by the energy that had radiated like\nliquid warmth through his veins when he’d rolled the stones in his hand.\nBut there was no respect in taking a few gems from a sorry old man. That\nwas what these thieves didn’t understand—jade alone didn’t make you a\nGreen Bone. Blood and training and clan made you a jade warrior; that’s how\nit had always been.

        "text": "it had always been. Hilo had both personal and clan reputation to uphold at\nall times. Shon Judonrhu was a drunkard, an old fool, a comical has-been of a\nGreen Bone, but he was still a Finger in the employ of No Peak, and that\nmade an offense against him Hilo’s concern.\nHe dropped his cigarette and ground it out. “That’s good,” he said.\nKehn stepped back at once. Tar, always the more industrious of the two,\ngave each boy a final kick before following suit. Hilo studied the teenagers\nmore closely. The one in the waiter’s shirt had the classic Kekonese islander\nlook—the leanness, the long arms, the dark hair and dark eyes. He lay half-\ndead, though it was hard to say if the jade fallout or the beating had done\nmore to make him that way. The round-faced Abukei boy sobbed quietly\nthrough a constant stream of pleading: “It wasn’t my idea, it wasn’t, I didn’t\nwant to, please let me go, please, I promise I won’t, I won’t …”\nHilo considered the possibility that the boys were not the imbeciles they\nseemed, but spies or hired criminals working for the Mountain or perhaps one\nof the smaller clans. He decided the odds of it were low. He squatted down\nand pushed the hair off the Abukei boy’s wet brow, causing him to flinch\nback in terror. Hilo shook his head and sighed. “What were you thinking?”\n“He promised me we could make a lot of money,” the teen wept, sounding\nmore than a little wronged. “He said the old man was so drunk he wouldn’t\neven notice. He said he knew a buyer, a reliable one, someone who would\npay the highest rates for cut jade without asking questions.”\n“And you believed him? No one crazy enough to steal jade off a Green\nBone means to sell it.” Hilo stood up. There was nothing to be done for the\nKekonese boy. Angry young men were prone to jade fever; Hilo had seen it\nplenty of times. Poor and naive, full of feral energy and ambition, they were\ndrawn to jade like ants to honey. They romanticized the legendary hero-\nbandit Green Bones that filled comic books and movies with their exploits.\nThey noticed how people said jen with respect and a little fear, and they\nwanted that for themselves. Never mind that without the years of strict\nmartial training, they weren’t capable of controlling the powers jade\nconferred. They flamed out, went mad, destroyed themselves and others.\nNo, that one was a hopeless case.\nThe Abukei boy, though, was merely stupid. Fatally so? You could\nforgive someone like him for playing the lottery by river diving; you couldn’t\nforgive a gross offense against the clan.\nAs if sensing Hilo’s thoughts, the teenager sped up his verbal torrent.\n“Please, Kaul-jen, it was stupid, I know it was stupid, I’ll never do it again, I\nswear. I’ve only ever taken jade from the river. If it wasn’t for the new carver\ntaking out Gee, I wouldn’t have even thought about doing anything else.

I’ve\nlearned my lesson, I swear on my grandmother’s grave, I won’t touch jade\nagain, I promise—”\n“What did you just say?” Hilo crouched back down and leaned in, eyes\nsquinted.\nThe teenager raised his eyes in fearful confusion. “I— What did I—”\n“About a new carver,” Hilo said.\nUnder Hilo’s insistent gaze, the boy quailed. “I-I used to sell whatever I\nfound in the river to Three-Fingered Gee. For raw jade, he paid on the spot in\ncash. Not a lot, but still pretty good. Gee was the carver on this side of town\nthat most of us—”\n“I know who he is,” said Hilo impatiently. “What happened to him?”\nSlow, shrewd hope crawled into the boy’s eyes with the realization that he\nhad information the Horn of the No Peak clan did not. “Gee’s gone. The new\ncarver showed up last month, said he would buy as much jade as we could\nbring him, raw or cut, no questions asked. He offered to join up with Three-\nFingered Gee, but Gee didn’t see the point of splitting his business with a\nnewcomer. So the new guy killed him.” The boy wiped snot and blood from\nhis nose onto his sleeve. “They say he strangled Gee with a telephone cord,\nthen cut off the rest of his fingers and sent them to the other carvers in the\ncity as a warning. Now anything we find in the river goes to him, and he only\npays half of what Gee used to pay. That’s why I tried to get out of diving—”\n“Have you seen this man?” Hilo asked.\nThe teenager hesitated, trying to decide which answer would save him and\nwhich would get him killed. “Y-yes. Just once.”\nHilo exchanged a glance with his Fists. The Abukei boy had solved one\nvexing mystery for them but raised another. Three-Fingered Gee might be a\nblack market jade carver, but he was a familiar one, a known entity, the stray\ndog in Hilo’s yard that stole from garbage cans but was not troublesome\nenough to be worth killing. So long as he confined himself to buying raw jade\nfrom the Abukei, the clans left his little smuggling business alone in\nexchange for occasional tip-offs on bigger fish. Who would flout No Peak\nauthority by killing him?\nHe turned back to the boy. “Could you describe him—this new carver?”\nAgain the hesitation. “Yes. I … I think so.”\nWhen the boy had stuttered through a description, Hilo stood up. “Bring\nthe car around,” he said to Kehn. “We’re taking these boys to see the Pillar.”\nCHAPTER\n3\nThe Sleepless Pillar\nK\naul Lanshinwan could not sleep. He had once been a reliable sleeper, but\nat least once a week for the past three months he’d found himself unable to\ndrift off.

He tried meditating to calm\nhimself before bed. He drank herbal tea and soaked in a salt bath. He\nsupposed he ought to consult a doctor. Perhaps a Green Bone physician could\ndetermine what energy imbalance he had, unclog whatever flow was blocked,\nprescribe the right foods to restore equilibrium.\nHe resisted. At the age of thirty-five he was supposed to be in the prime of\nhis health and at the peak of his power. It was why his grandfather had finally\nconsented to cede leadership to him, why the rest of No Peak accepted that\nthe mantle had passed from the legendary but old and ailing Kaul Seningtun\nto his grandson. If word got out that the Pillar of the clan was suffering health\nproblems, it would not reflect well on him. Even something as mundane as\ninsomnia might arouse speculation. Was he mentally unstable? Unable to\ncarry his jade? Being perceived as weak could be fatal.\nLan got up, put on a shirt, and went downstairs. He slipped on his shoes\nand went into the garden. Being outside made him feel better at once. The\nfamily estate sat near the heart of Janloon—one could see the red roof of the\nRoyal Council building and the tiered conical top of the Triumphal Palace\nfrom the upstairs windows of the house—but the buildings and landscaped\ngrounds of the Kaul property sprawled across five acres and were enclosed\nby high brick walls that sheltered it from the surrounding urban bustle. To a\nGreen Bone, it was not quiet—Lan could hear the rustle of a mouse in the\ngrass, the whir of a small insect over the pond, the crunch of his own shoes\nalong the smoothed pebble path—but the ever-present hum of the city was\nfaint. The garden was an oasis of peace. Alone in this small patch of nature,\naway from the heady swirl of other jade auras, he could relax.\nHe sat down on a stone bench and closed his eyes. Settling into his own\nheartbeat and breath, into the steady churn of blood through his veins, he\nexplored unhurriedly. He followed the wingbeats of a bat overhead as it\ndarted this way, then that, snatching insects out of the air. From the breeze\nskimming across the small pond, he picked out the scent of blooms: orange,\nmagnolia, honeysuckle. He searched along the ground for the mouse he’d\nsensed earlier and found it—a hot spot of thrumming life, stark and bright in\nthe darkness of the lawn.\nWhen he’d been a student at Kaul Dushuron Academy, he’d spent a night\nlocked in a cavernous, pitch-black underground chamber with three rats. It\nwas one of the tests of Perception administered to initiates at the age of\nfourteen. He’d groped blindly along the cold stone walls, listening for the\ninaudible scritch of tiny claws, questing for blood heat like a snake, keenly\naware that the exam ended if—and only if—he caught and killed all three of\nthe sharp-toothed rats with his bare hands.

        "text": "the sharp-toothed rats with his bare hands. Lan’s back tensed at the memory.\nA sharp nudge in the periphery of his awareness: Doru was approaching,\ncrossing the garden, the invisible but distinctive jade aura that surrounded\nhim parting the night like thin red light cutting through smoke.\nLan let out his breath and opened his eyes, a grimace of a smile tilting his\nmouth. If Doru found him catching mice in the garden at night, it would be a\nfar greater symptom of instability than mere insomnia. He was irritated,\nthough, at having his solitude interrupted and did not get up to greet the man.\nYun Dorupon’s voice was soft and raspy. It smelled medicinal and\nsounded like gravel being sloshed in a pan. “Sitting out here alone?\nSomething the matter, Lan-se?”\nLan frowned at the man’s use of the familial endearment; it was a suffix to\nbe used with children and the elderly, not one’s superior. For a Weather Man\nto use the term with his Pillar suggested a subtle insubordination. Lan knew\nthat Doru meant no disrespect; old habits were simply hard to break. Doru\nhad known him since he was a boy, had been a fixture in the clan and in the\nKaul household for as long as Lan could remember. Now, however, the man\nwas supposed to be his strategist and trusted advisor, not his minder and\nuncle figure.\n“Nothing,” Lan said, finally standing up and turning to face the man. “I\nlike it out here in the garden at night. It’s important to be alone with your\nthoughts sometimes.” A mild rebuke for the intrusion.\nDoru did not seem to notice. “I’m sure you have a lot on your mind.” The\nWeather Man was a rail-thin figure with an egg-shaped head and tapered\nchin, who wore wool sweaters and dark blazers that padded him up even in\nthe oppressive heat of summer. His stiff manner gave him the air of an\nacademic, but that was grossly misleading. Decades ago, Doru had been a\nMountain Man—one of the indomitable rebels led by Kaul Seningtun and\nAyt Yugontin, who resisted and ultimately ended foreign occupation of the\nisland of Kekon. Doru had spent the final year of the Many Nations War in a\nShotarian prison, and rumor had it that underneath his dowdy clothes he was\nmissing plugs of flesh from his legs and arms, along with both his testicles.\nDoru said, “The KJA is due to decide on the latest round of proposed\nexports by the end of the month. Have you considered whether you’ll be\nlending your approval in the final vote?” The debate within the Kekon Jade\nAlliance over whether to increase the national sale of jade to foreign powers\n—namely Espenia and her allies—had been going on all spring.\n“You know what I think,” Lan said.\n“Have you spoken about it to Kaul-jen?” Doru meant Kaul Seningtun of\ncourse. No matter the three younger Green Bones in the family—for Doru\nthere was only one Kaul-jen.\nLan hid his annoyance. “There’s no need to bother him when it’s not\nnecessary.” Perhaps Doru wasn’t the only member of No Peak who expected\nLan to consult his grandfather on all major decisions, but that could not go"

        "text": "necessary.” Perhaps Doru wasn’t the only member of No Peak who expected\nLan to consult his grandfather on all major decisions, but that could not go\non. It was past time to start sending the message that he was the one who held\nsole responsibility as Pillar. “The Espenians ask too much. If we give in to\nthem every time they want something of us, it won’t be long before every last\npebble of jade on the island finds itself into an Espenian military vault.”\nThe Weather Man was silent for a moment, then inclined his head. “As\nyou say.”\nThe thought came to Lan unbidden: Doru’s getting old, too old to change.\nHe was grandfather’s Weather Man and will always think of himself that\nway. I’ll have to replace him soon. He cut off his unkind train of thought. A\ngood sense of Perception didn’t enable a Green Bone to read minds, but those\nwith a honed ability could pick up on the subtle physical changes that laid\nbare emotion and intent. The only visible green on Doru were the understated\nrings on his thumbs, but Lan knew the man wore most of his jade out of sight\nand was more skilled than he appeared; he might Perceive the sudden turn in\nLan’s mind even if there was no sign of it on his face.\nHe masked any possible slip as impatience. “You didn’t come out here\njust to badger me about KJA business. What else is it?”\nThe floodlights at the gate switched on, bathing the front of the house and\nthe long driveway with yellow light. Doru said, “Hilo just arrived. He’s\nasking to see you right away.”\nLan crossed the garden and walked quickly toward the shape of Hilo’s\nunmistakable, oversized white sedan. One of his brother’s lieutenants, Maik\nKehn, was leaning against the driver side door of the Duchesse Priza,\nchecking his watch. Maik Tar stood off to the side with Hilo. At their feet\nwere two lumps. As Lan drew near, he saw the lumps were a pair of teenage\nboys, slumped forward over their knees, foreheads to the asphalt.\n“Glad I caught you before you went to sleep,” Hilo teased. The younger\nKaul often prowled the streets until dawn; he claimed it was all part of being\na good Horn, the threat of his nocturnal presence tempering the agents of vice\nthat plied their trade in clan territory when darkness fell. No one could say\nKaul Hilo was not dedicated to his job, particularly when it involved food\nand drink, pretty girls and loud music, bars and gambling dens, the occasional\nincident of explosive violence.\nLan ignored the jibe. He looked down at the two boys. They had been\nbadly beaten before being driven here in the car and deposited on the\npavement. “What is this about?”\n“That old boozehound Shon Ju nearly lost his measly bit of jade to these\nclowns,” Hilo said. “But it turns out this one”—he nudged the heavier-set\nboy with his foot—“has some interesting news I thought you ought to hear in\nperson.

        "text": "person. Go on, kid, tell the Pillar what you know.”\nThe teenager lifted his face. Both of his eyes were black, and his lip was\nsplit. His blood-plugged nose made his voice nasal as he told Lan about the\nsudden takeover of Three-Fingered Gee’s raw jade business. “I don’t know\nthe new guy’s name. We just call him the Carver.”\n“He’s Abukei?” Lan asked.\n“No,” slurred the boy through puffy lips. “A foreign stone-eye. He wears\nan Ygutan-style coat and one of those square hats.” He glanced over\nnervously as his companion stirred and moaned.\n“Tell him what the Carver looks like,” Hilo demanded.\n“I only saw him for a few minutes this one time,” the boy hedged,\nfrightened anew by Hilo’s sharp tone. “He’s short, a little heavy. He has a\nmustache, and spots on his face. He dresses like an Ygutanian and carries a\ngun, but he speaks Kekonese with no accent.”\n“What territory does he work?”\nThe Abukei teen was sweating under the interrogation. He lifted his\nbruised eyes to Lan, begging. “I-I’m not sure. Most of the Forge. Parts of\nPaw-Paw and the Docks. Maybe up into Coinwash and Fishtown.” He\ndropped his forehead to the ground and his voice became muffled. “Kaul-jen.\nPillar. I’m nothing to you, nothing at all, just a stupid kid who made a stupid\nmistake. I’ve told you everything I know.”\nThe other boy was conscious now, though he remained silent except for\nhis labored breathing. Lan said, “Look at me.” The teenager raised his head.\nThe whites of his eyes were red from burst capillaries. His expression was\nsunken and haunted—not the face of a boy at all, not anymore, but the face of\nsomeone who’d tasted jade the wrong way and was ruined because of it. He\nmust be in terrible pain, but he still radiated an inner rage that burned like a\ngaslight.\nLan felt a small knot of pity for him. The boy was a victim of confusing\ntimes. The laws of nature used to be clear. The Abukei were immune to jade.\nMost foreigners were too sensitive to it; even if a Shotarian or an Espenian\nlearned to control the physical and mental powers, he would almost certainly\nfall victim to the Itches. Only the Kekonese, an isolated race descended over\ncenturies from the hybridized bloodline of the Abukei and the ancient Tuni\nsettlers to the island, possessed a natural ability to harness jade, and even\nthen, only after years of extensive preparation.\nUnfortunately, these days, exaggerated stories of supposedly self-taught\nforeigners wearing jade gave impoverished Kekonese kids the wrong idea. It\nmade them think that all they needed were some street-fighting lessons and\nmaybe the right chemical aids. Lan said, “Jade is death for people like you.\nYou steal it, you smuggle it, you wear it—it all ends the same way: with you\nfeeding the worms.” He fixed the boy with a deadly stern gaze. “Get off my\nproperty, both of you, and don’t let my brother see you again.”"

        "text": "feeding the worms.” He fixed the boy with a deadly stern gaze. “Get off my\nproperty, both of you, and don’t let my brother see you again.”\nThe Abukei boy clambered to his feet; even the other one got up faster\nthan Lan would have thought him capable of. Together they limped hurriedly\ntoward escape without looking back.\nLan said to Maik Kehn, “Tell the guard to open the gate.” Kehn glanced at\nHilo for his approval before doing as Lan ordered. The tiny gesture annoyed\nLan. The two Maiks were slavishly loyal to Hilo. They eyed the two fleeing\nboys carefully, remembering their faces.\nHilo’s smile was gone. Without it, he looked his real age, instead of\nbarely older than the teenagers he’d brutalized. “I would have let the Abukei\nboy live,” he said, “but the other one—you made the wrong call. He’ll be\nback; he has that look. I’ll only have to kill him later.”\nHilo might be right. There were two types of jade thieves. Most wanted\nwhat they believed jade could give them—status, profit, power over others—\nbut for some, the desire for jade itself was a rot in the brain, an obsession that\nwould only grow. Hilo might be comfortable judging and executing for a first\noffense, but Lan was not ready to say there was no hope for the boy to find\nsome other outlet for his ill-conceived ambition. “You taught them their\nlesson,” he said. “You have to give people a chance to learn. They’re just\nkids after all—stupid kids.”\n“I don’t remember stupidity being an excuse around here when I was a\nkid.”\nLan regarded his brother. Hilo’s hands were stuffed into his pockets, his\nelbows jutted out and his shoulders curled slightly forward with casual\ninsolence. You’re still a kid, Lan thought ungenerously. The Horn was second\nin the clan and of equal rank to the Weather Man; he was supposed to be a\nseasoned warrior. Hilo was the youngest Horn anyone could remember, but\ndespite this, no one seemed to question his position. Either because he was a\nKaul and carried his jade well, or perhaps because, when the old Horn had\nretired a year and a half ago, grandfather had approved Hilo’s appointment\nwith no more than a shrug. “What else would he be any good for?” Kaul Sen\nhad said.\nLan changed the subject. “You think the new carver is Tem Ben.” A\nstatement, not a question.\n“Who else could it be?” said Hilo.\nThe Tems were part of the powerful and sprawling Mountain clan. They\nwere a proud family of Green Bones, but Tem Ben was a stone-eye. It\nhappened sometimes—recessive genetics combined to produce a Kekonese\nchild as unresponsive to jade as any Abukei native. Being an embarrassment\nto the bloodline as well as a brutal lout, Tem Ben had been shipped off by the\nfamily years ago to study and work in desolate northern Ygutan. His sudden\nreturn to Kekon and his savage entry into the unpolished jade-dealing\nbusiness made a certain degree of sense. Only a jade-immune stone-eye could\nbuy, hoard, cut, and sell street jade.

As for what his activities implied—that\nwas more disturbing.\n“He wouldn’t be back here without family say-so,” Hilo concluded. “And\nthe Tems wouldn’t do anything without approval from Ayt.” Hilo made a\nnoise in his throat, then spat into the bushes. Clearly, he referred to Ayt\nMada, adopted daughter of the great Ayt Yugontin, and now the Pillar of the\nMountain clan. “I’ll wager my jade that grasping bitch not only knows about\nthis but had a hand in arranging it.”\nDoru had been hovering in the background the entire time and now glided\nforward like a wraith to join the conversation. “The Pillar of the Mountain\nclan concerning herself with carvers of black market jade scrap?” He did not\nhide his skepticism. “That’s quite a leap to make based on the word of a\nfrightened Abukei boy.”\nHilo turned a thinly veiled look of disdain on the older man. “He might be\na drunken fool, but Shon Ju keeps his ear to the ground. He says our Lantern\nMen in the Armpit are getting their businesses squeezed. The owner of the\nTwice Lucky told me the same story and said it’s Mountain Fingers doing the\nsqueezing. If the Mountain’s trying to muscle us out of the Armpit, is it so\nhard to believe they’d want someone they control working inside our\ndistricts, feeding them information? They’re gambling we’ll leave the new\ncarver alone and not risk antagonizing the Tems over a little smuggling.”\n“You’re jumping to a number of conclusions, Hilo-se.” Doru’s voice was\na calm counterpoint to Hilo’s. “The names Ayt and Kaul go back a long way\ntogether. The Mountain would not move against your grandfather while he\nstill lives.”\n“I’m telling you what I know.” Hilo paced in front of the two older men.\nLan could sense the agitation running off him freely. Hilo’s jade aura was\nlike bright liquid next to Doru’s thick smoke. “Grandda and Ayt Yugontin\nrespected each other even when they were rivals, but that’s all in the past. Old\nYu is dead now, and Ayt Mada is making her own moves.”\nLan looked up at the grand, sprawling Kaul house as he considered his\nbrother’s words. “No Peak has been growing faster than the Mountain for\nyears,” he conceded. “They know we’re the only clan that’s a threat to them.”\nHilo stopped his pacing and took his brother by the arm. “Let me take five\nof my Fists into the Armpit. Ayt is testing us, sending her littlest Fingers to\ncause trouble and see what we’ll do. So we cut a few of them off and return\nthem to her in body bags. Send the signal that we won’t be messed with.”\nDoru’s thin lips pulled back as if he’d bitten into a lime. His wedged head\nswung around to pin the younger Kaul with disbelieving scorn. “Have they\nkilled any of ours, either Green Bones or Lantern Men? Are you saying we\nshould be the first ones to spill blood? To break the peace? A certain amount"

A certain amount\nof savagery is to be expected in a Horn, but such childish overreaction is a\ndisservice to your Pillar.”\nHilo’s aura flared like a wind-licked flame. Lan felt it buffet him like heat\na second before Hilo said, in an incongruously chilled voice, “The Pillar can\ndecide for himself when he’s being badly served.”\n“That’s enough,” Lan growled at both of them. “We’re here to make\ndecisions together, not get into cock-waving contests.”\nDoru said, “Lan-se, this sounds like a case of a few overeager and\nquarrelsome youths in the Armpit, which has always been a troublesome part\nof town.” The Weather Man’s jade aura glowed evenly like smoldering old\ncoals, the slow-burning residual energy of a man who’d survived many fires\nand was not eager to start them. “Surely a peaceful solution can be found, one\nthat preserves the old respect between our clans.”\nLan looked between his Horn and his Weather Man. The two roles existed\nto be the right and left hand of the Pillar, responsible for the military and\nbusiness arms of the clan, respectively. The Horn was visible, tactical, the\nclan’s most formidable warrior, leader of the Fists and the Fingers who\npatrolled and defended clan territory and the residents within from rivals and\nstreet criminals. The Weather Man was strategic, operational, the brain\nworking behind the scenes through an office full of capable Luckbringers,\nmanaging the clan’s substantial flow of tribute money, patronage, and\ninvestments. A certain amount of conflict between these two critical roles\nwas hardly surprising—expected, even. But Hilo and Doru were starkly\nopposed in nature as well as position. Looking at the two men, Lan\nquestioned what to rely on: Hilo’s strength and street instincts, or Doru’s\nexperience and caution.\n“See if you can find out whether the Ayts are backing Tem Ben,” Lan said\nto Hilo. “In the meantime, send some of your Fists into the Armpit, but\nonly”—he shook his head at his brother’s expectant look—“to reassure our\nLantern Men and protect their businesses. No attacks, no retaliations, no\nwhispering of names. No one sheds blood without family approval, not even\nif they’re offered a clean blade.”\n“A prudent decision,” Doru said, nodding.\nHilo grimaced but seemed partially appeased. “Fine,” he said. “But I’m\ntelling you, this will only get worse, not better. We won’t be able to ride on\nGrandda’s reputation much longer.” He tugged his right earlobe in the\ncustomary gesture to ward off bad luck. “May he live three hundred years,”\nhe grumbled dutifully but without feeling. “The fact is, Ayt is making a point\nof parading her power as Pillar, and if No Peak is going to hold our own,\nyou’re going to have to do the same.”\nSharply, Lan said, “I don’t need my little brother to lecture me like an old\nman.”"

        "text": "you’re going to have to do the same.”\nSharply, Lan said, “I don’t need my little brother to lecture me like an old\nman.”\nHilo tilted his head at the reprimand. Then he smiled broadly, his face\ntransforming, regaining its open boyishness. “True; you have enough of that\naround here already, don’t you?” He turned away with an affable shrug and\nstrolled back to the monstrous white Duchesse, where Maik Kehn and Maik\nTar stood sharing a smoke and waiting patiently for their captain to return.\nHis warm jade aura receded with the smoothness of a summer river; Hilo was\nnot one to stew in a grudge after a confrontation. Lan marveled that a\nchildhood of ruthless training at Kaul Dushuron Academy had not dented the\nyounger Kaul grandson’s relentlessly cheerful ego, the way he sauntered\nthrough the world as if it were a set piece built around him.\nDoru said quietly, “You must excuse my rudeness to him tonight, Lan-se.\nHilo is a fearsome Horn—he just needs to be kept on a short leash.” His\npinched mouth curled up, as if he knew Lan had been thinking the same\nthing. “Do you need me for anything else tonight?”\n“No. Good night, Doru.”\nThe old advisor inclined his head and retreated silently down the side path\nthat led to the Weather Man’s residence.\nLan watched Doru’s figure recede, then walked up the driveway to the\nKaul house. It was the largest structure on the estate and the most impressive\n—clean, modern symmetry, classic Kekonese wood paneling and green tile\nroof, concrete pavers glinting with crushed seashells. The white columns\nwere a bit of an ostentatious foreign accent that lent grandeur but that Lan\nwould probably not have included if the decision had been up to him, which\nit had not. Grandfather had spent a good part of his fortune designing and\nbuilding the family home. He was vain about its symbolism too, saying it was\na sign of how far Green Bones had come that they now lived in open wealth\nwhen only a generation ago they had been hunted fugitives hiding in secret\njungle camps in the mountains, surviving only on their wits and stealth and\nthe help of civilian Lantern Men.\nLan raised his eyes to the upper, leftmost window of the house. It was lit\nbehind the silhouette of a man sitting in a chair. Grandfather was still awake,\neven at this time of night.\nLan let himself into the house and hesitated in the foyer. As much as he\ndisliked to admit it, Hilo was right—he needed to more firmly wield his\npower as Pillar. It was his responsibility to make the hard decisions, and\nseeing as he wasn’t able to sleep tonight, he might as well handle one of them\nnow. With more than a little misgiving, he climbed the stairs.\nCHAPTER\n4\nThe Torch of Kekon\nL\nan walked into his grandfather’s room, which was furnished with beautiful\nfurniture and art: rosewood tables from Stepenland, hanging silks from the\nFive Monarchs period of the Tun Empire, glass lamps from southern Ygutan.\nMost of the available wall space was covered with photographs and\nmementos.

        "text": "Most of the available wall space was covered with photographs and\nmementos. Kaul Seningtun was a national hero, one of the leaders of the\nfierce Green Bone–led uprising that had, more than a quarter of a century\nago, finally ended the Empire of Shotar’s control over the island of Kekon.\nAfter the war, humbly expressing that he had no appetite for politics nor\ndesire to rule, Kaul Sen had become a prosperous businessman and towering\ncivic figure; photos of him shaking hands and posing at various official state\nfunctions and charitable events vied with certificates of honor on the wall.\nThe old man who had once been called the Torch of Kekon did not appear\nto dwell on the evidence of his accomplishments or the luxurious things he\nhad acquired. Instead he spent most of his time gazing out past the city\nskyline to the distant green mountains covered in jungle and shrouded by\nclouds of mist. Lan wondered if, in the twilight of his life, that was where his\ngrandfather’s heart lay: not in the city he had helped to build up from the\nashes of war to the swarming metropolis it was now, but deep in the interior\nof the island, a place the ancient Kekonese had considered sacred and\nforeigners had believed to be cursed, where young Kaul Sen had spent his\nglory days with comrades as a rebel and a warrior.\nLan stopped warily a short distance from his grandfather’s chair. It was\nhard to predict the old man’s moods these days. Kaul Sen had always been an\nunrelentingly energetic and formidable man—quick to praise, equally quick\nto criticize, effusive with both. He never minced words, never settled for the\nsmall gain when more could be risked for outright victory. Now, even at the\nage of eighty-one, he still radiated a dense and powerful jade aura.\nHe was not as he had been, though. His wife—let the gods recognize her\n—had passed away three years ago, and four months later Ayt Yugontin had\ndied from a sudden stroke at the age of sixty-five. Some vital aspect of the\nTorch’s indomitable will had slowly drained away since then. He’d handed\nclan leadership over to Lan with little ceremony and was now often pensive\nand withdrawn, or volatile and cruel. He sat without moving; a blanket was\ndraped over his thin shoulders despite the summer heat.\n“Grandda,” Lan said, though he knew announcing his presence was\nunnecessary. Age had not dulled the patriarch’s senses; he could still\nPerceive another Green Bone from across a city block.\nKaul Sen’s gaze was fixed on some middle distance; it was difficult to tell\nwhether he was paying any attention to the program playing on the color\ntelevision that had recently been installed in the corner of his room. The\nvolume was turned down on the set, but at a glance, Lan saw that it was a\ndocumentary on the Many Nations War, in which Kekon’s fight for\nindependence had been but an ancillary part. A burst of light from an on-\nscreen explosion flickered off the many squares of framed glass around the\nwalls.\n“The Shotarians, they used to drop bombs on the mountains,” Kaul Sen\nsaid, his voice slow but still resonant, as if he were addressing a rapt\nassembly of people instead of the dark windowpane. “But they were afraid of"

They would advance through the jungle in a\nline, those Shottie soldiers. They all looked the same, like ants. Clumsy. We\nwere like panthers. We’d pick them off, one at a time.” Kaul Sen jabbed the\nair with his finger as if marking invisible Shotarian soldiers around the room.\n“Their guns and grenades against our moon blades and talon knives. Ten of\nthem to one of us, and still they couldn’t crush us, no matter how they tried.\nAh, how they tried.”\nThis again. The same old war stories. Lan steeled himself to be patient.\n“So they went after the Lantern Men, the ordinary people who hung green\nlanterns in their windows for us night after night. Man, woman, old, young,\nrich, poor—it didn’t matter. If the Shotties suspected you of being in the One\nMountain Society, there wouldn’t be any warning. You would just\ndisappear.” Kaul Sen shifted back in his chair. His voice took on a grave,\nmusing quality. “There was a family that hid me and Yu in their shed for\nthree nights. A man, his wife, and their daughter. Because of them, we made\nit back to camp alive. A few weeks later, I returned to check on them, but\nthey were gone. All the dishes and furniture still in place, the pot still on the\nstove, but they were gone.”\nLan cleared his throat. “That was a long time ago.”\n“That was when I showed you what to do if you needed to—how to cut\ninto your neck with your talon knife. Quick, like—” Kaul Sen mimed a\nvicious motion against his own jugular. “You were maybe twelve years old at\nthe time, but you understood perfectly. Do you remember, Du?”\n“Grandda.” Lan winced. “I’m not Du. It’s me—your grandson Lan.”\nKaul Sen turned to look over his shoulder. He seemed confused for a\nmoment; it was not the first time Lan had caught him speaking aloud to the\nson he’d lost twenty-six years ago. Then his eyes cleared of their fog. His\nmouth flattened in disappointment, and he sighed. “Even your aura feels like\nhis,” he grumbled. He turned back to the window. “Only his was stronger.”\nLan closed his hands behind his back and looked away to hide his\nirritation. It rankled enough to come in here and see the photographs of his\nfather rivaling the number of honors on the wall, without also having to\nendure his grandfather’s increasingly frequent and offhanded insults.\nAs a child, Lan had treasured the photographs of his father. He’d spent\nhours looking at them. In the largest of the black-and-white images, Kaul Du\nwas standing between Kaul Sen and Ayt Yugontin inside a military tent. The\nthree of them were examining a spread-out map. They had talon knives at\ntheir waists and moon blades slung over their shoulders. Dressed in the loose\ngreen tunic of a One Mountain Society general, and looking straight into the\ncamera, Kaul Du radiated revolutionary zeal and confidence."

Dressed in the loose\ngreen tunic of a One Mountain Society general, and looking straight into the\ncamera, Kaul Du radiated revolutionary zeal and confidence.\nNow, though, Lan saw the mounted photos as frustrating relics. Looking\nat them was like looking at an impossible photograph of himself trapped in a\nbygone time and place. He was the spitting image of his father—the same\njawline and nose, even the same expression of concentration, left eye\nnarrowed. Comments on their likeness had filled him with pride as a boy.\n“He looks just like his father! He’s destined be a great Green Bone warrior,”\npeople would exclaim. “The gods are returning the hero to us through his\nson.”\nNow, both the photographs and the comparisons were merely galling. He\nturned back to his grandfather, determined to steer both of them back to the\npresent. “Shae’s coming home this week. She’s arriving on Fourthday\nevening to pay her respects.”\nKaul Sen swiveled around in his chair fast. “Respect?” He drew himself\nup in fierce indignation. “Where was her respect two years ago? Where was\nher respect when she turned her back on her clan and country and sold herself\nto the Espenians like a whore? Is she still with that man, that Shotarian man?”\n“Shotarian-Espenian,” Lan corrected.\n“Whatever,” said his grandfather.\n“She and Jerald aren’t together anymore.”\nKaul Sen settled back into his chair a little. “Good news, at least,” he\ngrumbled. “It would never have worked. Too much bad blood between our\npeoples. And her children would’ve been weak.”\nLan bit back a reply in Shae’s defense; it was better to let the old man\nvoice his grievances and be done with them. He wouldn’t be so angry if Shae\nhad not always been his favorite as a child. “She’s coming back to stay, at\nleast for a while,” Lan said. “Be kind to her, Grandda. She wrote to me,\nsending you her love, and prayers for your long life and health.”\n“Huh,” grunted the elder Kaul, but he seemed somewhat placated. “My\nlong life and health, she says. My son is dead. My wife is dead. Ayt Yu is\ndead too. They were all younger than me.” On the television screen, lines of\nrunning soldiers were falling under silent gunfire. “How am I still alive when\nthey’re all dead?”\nLan smiled thinly. “The gods love you, Grandda.”\nKaul Sen snorted. “We didn’t end it right, me and Ayt Yu. We fought side\nby side in the war, but in peacetime we let business come between us.\nBusiness.” Kaul Sen spat the word. He waved one gnarled hand at the room,\nindicating all he had built with an air of scorn and resignation. “The Shotties\ncouldn’t break the One Mountain Society, but we did. We split our clans. I\ndidn’t even get a chance to speak to Yu before he died. We were both so\nstubborn. Curse him. There will never be anyone like him.

Lan glanced back at the door,\ndebating how best to excuse himself. Grandfather was too caught up\nreminiscing about the days when Green Bones had been united in\nnationalistic purpose; he wasn’t going to want to hear about how, if Hilo was\nto be believed, his old comrade’s clan and successor were now the enemy.\n“It’s late, Grandda,” he said. “I’ll see you in the morning.”\nHe started to go, but Kaul Sen raised his voice. “What did you come for at\nthis hour, anyway? Spit it out.”\nLan paused with a hand on the door. “It can wait.”\n“You came to talk, so talk,” his grandfather ordered. “You’re the Pillar!\nYou don’t wait.”\nLan blew out sharply, then turned around. He strode to the television and\nshut it off, then faced his grandfather. “It’s about Doru.”\n“What about him?”\n“I think it’s time he retired. Time I appointed a new Weather Man.”\nKaul Sen leaned forward, fully present now, his eyes tight. “Is he failing\nyou somehow?”\n“No, it’s not that. I want someone else in the role. Someone who could\nbring a fresh perspective.”\n“Who would that be?”\n“Woon perhaps. Or Hami.”\nThe senior Kaul frowned, the map of wrinkles on his face shifting into a\nnew constellation of displeasure. “You think either of them would be as\ncapable and loyal a Weather Man as Yun Dorupon? Who has done as much\nfor this clan as he has? He’s never led me astray, never failed me in war or\nbusiness.”\n“I don’t doubt that.”\n“Doru stuck with me. He could have gone over to the Mountain. Ayt\nwould have welcomed him in a heartbeat. But he agreed with me that we\nneeded to open ourselves up to the world. We fell to the Shotties in the first\nplace because we’d been closed for too long. Doru stuck with me and he\nnever wavered. Smart man. Smart and farsighted. Calculating.”\nAnd still your man through and through. Lan said, “He served you well\nfor more than twenty years. It’s time he retired. I’d like him to step down\ngracefully, with all respect. No hard feelings at all. I’m asking you as his\nfriend to talk to him.”\nHis grandfather stabbed a finger in his direction. “You need Doru. You\nneed his experience. Don’t push change just for the sake of change! Doru’s\nsteady, reliable—not like that Hilo. You’ll have enough on your hands with\nthat loose screw for a Horn. While Du was off fighting for his country, who\nknows what swamp demon snuck into your mother’s bedroom to spawn that\nboy.”\nLan knew his grandfather was being cruel to throw him off, distract him\nfrom his original purpose. Misdirecting opponents was something he’d\nalways excelled at, on the battlefield and later in the boardroom. Still Lan\nwas unable to help himself. “You’ve outdone yourself, managing to\ndisparage half of your own family in one go,” he said harshly. “If you think"

I’ll give\nhim that. A Weather Man should be respected, but a Horn has to be feared.\nThat boy should have been born fifty years ago; he would have struck terror\ninto Shotarian hearts. He would’ve been a fearsome warrior, just like Du.”\nThe patriarch’s eyes narrowed and his stare turned scrutinizing. “Du was\nthirty years old when he died. He was a battle-hardened leader of men. He\nhad a wife and two sons and a third child cooking in the womb. Carried his\njade light as a god. You might look like him, but you’ll never be half the man\nhe was. That’s why the other clans think they can disrespect you. That’s why\nEyni left you.”\nLan was speechless for a second. Then a dull rage broke and pounded\nbehind his eyes. “Eyni,” he said, “is not part of this conversation.”\n“You should have killed that man!” Kaul Sen threw his arms up into the\nair and shook them in disbelief of his grandson’s stupidity. “You let a\njadeless foreigner walk off with your wife. You lost face with the clan!”\nA fleeting and horrible desire to shove his grandfather out of the second-\nstory window crossed Lan’s mind. That was what the old man wanted after\nall, wasn’t it? Flagrant egotistical violence. Yes, Lan thought, he could have\nchallenged Eyni’s lover—fought and killed him in the way any self-\nrespecting Kekonese man would feel entitled. Perhaps it would have been a\nmore fitting way for a Pillar to act. But it would have been pointless. An\nempty gesture. He wouldn’t have kept Eyni; she was already determined to\ngo. All he could have done was trample out her happiness and make her hate\nhim. And if you loved someone, truly loved them, shouldn’t their happiness\nmatter, even more than your honor?\n“How does not killing a man in a romantic dispute make me an unworthy\nPillar?” Lan demanded, his voice clipped. “You named me your successor,\nbut you’ve yet to show me support or respect. I came only to ask for your\nhelp with Doru, and instead I get ramblings and insults.”\nKaul Sen stood up. The move was sudden and unexpectedly fluid. The\nblanket around his shoulders slid to the ground. “If you’re a worthy Pillar,\nthen prove it.” The old man’s eyes were like obsidian, and his face was a dry,\nharsh desert. “Show me how green you are.”\nLan stared at his grandfather. “Don’t be ridiculous.”\nKaul Sen crossed the short space between them in a heartbeat. His body\nrippled like a serpent’s spine as he slammed both hands into Lan’s chest. The\nwhip-like blow sent Lan stumbling backward. He barely managed to Steel\nhimself; the shock reverberated through his frame with concussive jade-\nfueled power. Lan dropped to one knee and gasped. “What was that for?”"

Lan dropped to one knee and gasped. “What was that for?”\nHis grandfather’s reply was to launch a bony fist at his face.\nLan rose and deflected the strike easily this time, as well as the three\nothers that followed in quick succession. Lan felt the air hum with the clash\nof their jade energies.\n“Grandda,” Lan snapped. “Stop it.” He backed away until he bumped into\na table, still fending off a volley of blows. Lan grimaced at the old man’s\nnearly out-of-control speed. It’s really time he stopped wearing so much jade.\nLike automobiles and firearms, jade was not something that deteriorating\nelderly folks ought to possess. Not that Kaul Sen would ever willingly\nrelinquish even the smallest pebble from the bracelets or heavy belt he wore\nat all times.\n“You can’t even beat an old man.” The elder Kaul was like a badger, all\nsinew and bone and oversized bad temper. His lips were pulled back in a\ntaunting leer as he jabbed and weaved. Lan moved to avoid him and knocked\nover an antique clay bowl; it landed on the hardwood floor with a heavy thud\nand rolled. “Come on, boy,” his grandfather wheezed, “where’s your pride?”\nHe slipped a strike under Lan’s arm and drove his middle knuckle between\nhis grandson’s smallest ribs.\nLan grunted with surprise and pain. Reacting without thinking, he cuffed\nhis grandfather across the head with a cupped hand.\nKaul Sen staggered. His eyes rolled; he folded to the ground with a look\nof childlike bewilderment.\nLan was mortified. He caught his grandfather around the shoulders. “Are\nyou all right? Grandda, I’m sorry—”\nHis grandfather drove two extended fingers, stiff as nails, into a pressure\npoint at the center of Lan’s chest. Lan collapsed, coughing violently as Kaul\nSen rolled over, got to his feet, and stood over him.\n“To be Pillar, you have to act with full intention.” For a moment Kaul\nSen’s age fell away and he was once again the towering Torch of Kekon. His\nback was straight, his face was hard. Every piece of jade on his body bespoke\nstrength and demanded respect. Briefly, Lan saw through a haze of anger and\nhumiliation the war hero his grandfather had once been.\n“Only full intention!” Kaul Sen barked. “Jade amplifies what you have\ninside you. What you intend.” He tapped his own chest. It made a hollow\nsound, like a gourd. “Without intention, no amount of jade will make you\npowerful.” He walked back to his chair and sat down. “Doru stays.”\nLan got to his feet without a word. He picked up the fallen bowl and\nplaced it back on the table, then leaned a hand heavily on the wall in a\nmoment of epiphanic sorrow. Only in this, just now, had his grandfather truly\nmade him Pillar—by proving to him beyond a doubt that he was alone.\nSilently, Lan left the room and closed the door behind him.\nCHAPTER\n5\nThe Horn’s Kitten\nW\nhen Kaul Hilo got behind the wheel of the Duchesse, Tar leaned his"

Our Lantern Men, our businesses.”\n“And if they challenge us? You okay with holding back?” Tar asked in a\nskeptical tone that implied he knew his boss better than that. Hilo suppressed\na sigh; Kehn rarely questioned him, but Tar had been his classmate at Kaul\nDu Academy and talked back sometimes. The younger Maik never made it\nany secret that he thought Lan was too conservative, that Hilo was the\nstronger of the two Kaul brothers. Of course, it was self-serving of him, and\nHilo did not appreciate it as much as he suspected Tar thought he did.\n“No killing,” he said firmly. “I’ll talk to you both tomorrow.” He started\nthe Duchesse, circled the roundabout in front of the house, and rolled back\ndown the long driveway.\nHe did not turn before the gates, up the narrower drive toward the house\nbehind his brother’s, the one appointed for the Horn of the clan. The previous\nHorn had been a grizzled general of his grandfather’s, and his taste in decor\nleft much to be desired. When Hilo had moved in, the house had smelled of\ndogs and fish stew. The carpet was green and the wallpaper was checkered. A\nyear and a half had passed, and he had still not renovated the place. He meant\nto but could not be bothered. It was not as if he spent much time there. He\nwas not the sort of Horn to issue orders from behind high walls and closed\ndoors and leave the work to his Fists. So the house was a place to sleep, that\nwas all.\nAs he drove away from the Kaul estate, Hilo rested an arm out of the open\nwindow and drummed his fingers in time to the beat from the radio.\nShotarian club music. When it wasn’t Espenian jiggy—or worse, Kekonese\nclassical—it was Shotarian club. Many people of an older generation still\nrefused to buy Shotarian-made products, listen to Shotarian music, or watch\nShotarian television shows, but Hilo had been less than a year old when the\nwar had ended and he was not one of them.\nHe was in a better mood now. He hadn’t been granted all the leeway he’d\nasked for, but he’d spoken his mind and knew what he had to do next. The\nthing Tar didn’t understand was that Hilo did not envy his brother’s position\nin the least. Handling bitter old Grandda, that freak Doru, KJA politics, and\nthe Royal Council … perhaps Lan had the patience for all that, but he, Hilo,\ncertainly didn’t. Life was short. He understood and embraced the simplicity\nof his role: lead and manage his Fists, protect his family’s territory, defend\nNo Peak from its enemies.

        "text": "No Peak from its enemies. Enjoy himself along the way.\nHe drove for thirty minutes, leaving behind the moneyed outskirts of the\nPalace Hill area around the Kaul home, speeding first down the wide\nboulevard of the General’s Ride, then turning onto a two-lane avenue, and\nfinally navigating increasingly narrow streets as he entered Paw-Paw, an old,\nworking-class neighborhood crammed full of small shops, questionable\nstreet-food vendors, and twisty alleyways that trapped careless rickshaw\ndrivers, mopeds, and stray dogs. Paw-Paw had stood nearly untouched during\nthe war and changed little in the time since, largely ignored by both questing\nforeigners and the pace of progress. At night, the streets were particularly\nlabyrinthine; the Duchesse’s side mirrors barely cleared the space between\nthe far smaller and rustier parked vehicles on either side of a street of brick\napartment buildings, built so close together a person could lean out the\nwindow and nearly touch his neighbor’s wall.\nHilo parked his car five blocks away from his intended destination. He\nwas not worried; he was deep inside Kaul territory. But he did not want his\nrecognizable car to be noticed in the same place every night. It made his\nmovements appear too routine, and it was important for his presence to be\nunpredictable. Besides, he liked to walk. The temperature had finally come\ndown, and it was a fine night. He left his jacket in the car and ambled\nleisurely, enjoying the peace found in that space between hours considered\nlate and those considered early.\nHe ignored the front door and climbed the rickety fire escape to the fifth\nfloor. There was a light on in the apartment. The window was unlatched and\ncracked wide open because of the heat. Hilo let himself in, swinging his legs\nacross the chipped sill and treading silently across the carpeted floor toward\nthe light in the bedroom.\nShe was asleep, an open book on her lap. The bedside lamp cast a veil of\norange light across the side of her face. Hilo stood in the doorway, watching\nher chest rise and fall in gentle, undisturbed breaths. The bedcovers came up\nto her knees but no farther. She was wearing a sleeveless cotton top with thin\nstraps and blue panties with white lace trim. Her dark hair was spread against\nthe whiteness of the pillow, tendrils of it curving across the paleness of her\nsmooth, unblemished bare shoulders.\nHilo admired her until the waiting became too much to bear. He crossed\nthe room and took the book from her fingers, marked the page, and set it on\nthe bedside table. She didn’t stir; he marveled at this: at her utter deafness to\npossible danger. She was so unlike a Green Bone she might as well have been\nanother sort of creature from him entirely.\nHe switched off the light, plunging the room into darkness. Then he\nclimbed on top of her, pinning her body and covering her mouth with his\nhand. She came awake in a start; her eyes flew open as her body jerked under\nhis weight. She let out a muffled scream before he laughed softly and\nwhispered into her ear, “You should be more careful, Wen. If you leave the\nwindow open at night, men with bad intentions might come through it.”\nShe stopped struggling. Her heart still pattered against his chest, exciting"

        "text": "window open at night, men with bad intentions might come through it.”\nShe stopped struggling. Her heart still pattered against his chest, exciting\nhim, but her body relaxed. She pulled his hand from her mouth. “It’s your\nfault,” she snapped. “I fell asleep waiting up for you, and in return you scare\nthe shit out of me. Where were you?”\nHe was pleased that she’d stayed up for him. “I was at the Twice Lucky,\ndealing with some trouble.”\nShe raised her eyebrows. “Trouble involving gambling or strippers?”\n“Not anything so fun,” he promised. “Ask your brothers if you don’t\nbelieve me.”\nWen squirmed provocatively underneath him, her bare shoulders and\nthighs rubbing against his clothes. “Kehn and Tar wouldn’t tell me a thing.\nThey’re too devoted to you.”\n“Give them some credit.” Hilo pulled her earlobe into his mouth and\nsucked as he worked his belt and pants off. “I’m sure they conspired to kill\nme. When they saw how I looked at you? They knew right away I was\nplanning to pop their little sister.” He pulled her panties down and stroked\nbetween her legs, then slid his first two fingers inside her. “I had to make\nthem my closest Fists or they would’ve gutted me.”\n“You can’t blame them,” she said, moving her hips encouragingly. His\nfingers glided in and out, slippery and warm. She undid the next three buttons\nof his shirt and pulled it over his head. “What could a son of the great Kaul\nfamily want with a stone-eye—especially from a disgraced family like mine\n—besides an easy lay?”\n“Many easy lays?” He kissed her hard, impatiently, attacking her mouth\nwith his lips and tongue. His cock was excruciatingly stiff against the inside\nof her thigh. Wen reached up to bury her hands in his hair. She ran her\nfingertips down his neck and chest, mapping the jade pieces studded all along\nhis collarbone and through his nipples. She touched and licked them utterly\nwithout fear, envy, or want, appreciating them only as a beautiful part of him,\nnothing more. He’d never let any other woman touch his jade, and it made\nhim wildly aroused, this fearless intimacy he had with her.\nHe pushed inside her, all at once. She was delicious—a riot of sensation.\nSunlight and ocean, summer fruit and musk. Hilo growled with pleasure and\nseized the headboard of the bed, wanting even more. His jade-sharp senses\nroared with blinding intensity: the crash of her heartbeat, the thunder of her\nbreath, the fire of her skin on his own. He regretted turning off the light; he\nwished he could see her better, drink in every detail of her body.\nWen lifted her hips off the mattress, clenching him, her eyes fixed on his,\ntwo tiny motes of reflected streetlight like candles floating in a pool. Her\nintense adoration pushed him higher. He sucked her cherry nipples. He dove\ninto the valley of her breasts and drowned in her incomparable perfume. Wen\ngrabbed his hips and drove him relentlessly, and he came, careening\ndelightedly out of control.\nHe lay on top of her, consciousness dancing away from him, breathing"

The sun was forcing its way into the\ncrevices between the buildings, seeping into the windows. It would be\nanother hot day.\nHilo gazed at the beautiful creature lying asleep beside him, and an\nintense urge rose and took hold of him: He wanted to seize and envelop her,\nand through some magic, pull her into himself, so he could hold her nestled\nsafe inside him wherever he went. Before Wen, he’d enjoyed women and\nexperienced warm, even tender, feelings for them. But that was nothing\ncompared to what he felt for Wen. The desire to make her happy was like a\nphysical ache. The thought of anyone harming her or taking her from him\nfilled him with feverish rage. She could ask anything of him and he would do\nit.\nTrue love, Hilo mused, was sensual and euphoric, but also painful and\ntyrannical, demanding obedience. It was clearly altogether different from the\nrebellious infatuation Shae had had for that Espenian, or the sensible\naffection that had existed between Lan and Eyni.\nBeing reminded of Eyni deflated him a little. It had taken a few weeks, but\nhe’d finally tracked down that whore and the man who’d so grievously\ninsulted his brother. They were living in Lybon, in Stepenland. He considered\nhiring someone to do the job, but a clan insult ought to be handled directly by\nthe clan. So he asked Tar to book an airplane ticket using a fake name and\npassport, but when he told Lan his plans, the Pillar had been ungrateful,\nangry even.\n“I never told you to do that,” Lan had snapped. “If I wanted their names\nwhispered, I would’ve done it myself, so it should’ve been obvious to you\nthat I don’t. Leave them alone, and from now on stay out of my personal\nlife.”\nHilo had been greatly irritated at the wasted effort. That’s what he got, for\ntrying to do his brother a favor. Lan always played his feelings so close to the\nchest, so how was Hilo supposed to know?\nWen stirred and made a delightful sleepy sound. Hilo forgot his\nrumination and crawled under the sheets to wake her with his mouth and\nfingers. He worked on her patiently, was gratified when he brought her to a\nshuddering climax, then made love to her again, more slowly and leisurely\nthis time.\nAfterward, as they lay in a sticky tangle, he said, “What you said last\nnight—about your family—you shouldn’t think that. What happened with\nyour parents was years ago, and no one doubts Kehn and Tar. The Maik\nname is good with the clan now.”\nWen was silent for a moment. “Not with all the clan. What about your\nfamily?”\n“What about them?”\nShe rested her head on his shoulder. “Shae has never trusted me.”\nHilo laughed. “Shae ran away with an Espenian naval brat, and now she’s"

She’s hardly\nin a position to judge. Why would you worry about what she thinks?” From\nthe unkind tone of his own voice, he realized with some surprise and\ndisappointment that he still hadn’t entirely forgiven her.\n“She’s always had your grandfather’s ear. I don’t think he’d approve of\nme even if I wasn’t a stone-eye.”\n“He’s a senile old man,” Hilo said. “Lan is Pillar now.” He gave her a\nreassuring kiss on the temple, but his demeanor changed; he rolled over and\nlay staring pensively at the yellow ceiling fan as it spun around and around.\nWen rolled to her side and looked at him with concern. “What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing,” he said.\n“Tell me.”\nWhen he told her about the previous evening’s events at the Twice Lucky\nand the conversation in the driveway of the Kaul estate, Wen propped herself\nup on one elbow and pursed her lips in concern. “Why did Lan let the boy\ngo? A jade thief at such a young age; he’s incurable. He’ll only be more\ntrouble for you later.”\nHilo shrugged. “I know; what can I say? Lan is an optimist. How did he\nbecome so softhearted, my tough big brother who always used to put me in\nmy place? He’s green enough, but he doesn’t think like a killer, and Ayt is a\nkiller all right. It’s obvious war with the Mountain is coming—can’t he see\nthat? That self-important old ferret Doru isn’t steering him right.”\n“Surely Lan ought to listen to you over Doru.”\n“Doru is like an old vine in the clan; there’s no getting around him.”\nWen sat up. Her glossy black hair tumbled over her back, and the morning\nlight illuminated the flawless curve of her cheek. She said to him, “You have\nto start preparing to defend No Peak on your own, then. Doru has his\nconnections, his informers, his sneaky ways. But all the Fists, and the Fingers\nunder them, are yours. Green Bones are warriors first, businessmen second. If\nthere’s a war to come, it’ll go to the streets—and the streets belong to the\nHorn.”\n“My kitten.” Hilo wrapped his arms around Wen’s shoulders and kissed\nher neck from behind. She put some of his Fists to shame. “You have the\nheart of a jade warrior.”\n“In the body of a stone-eye.” Her sigh was lovely even though her voice\nwas bitter. “If only I was a Green Bone, I could help you. I would be your\nmost dedicated Fist.”\n“I don’t need another Fist,” he said. “You’re perfect the way you are.\nLeave the Green Bone worries to me.” He cupped her breasts, holding their\npleasant weight in his hands, and craned in for another kiss.\nShe pulled her face back, refusing to be diverted. “How many Fists do you\nhave—good ones you can count on? Kehn tells me some of them are soft;"

Kehn tells me some of them are soft;\nthey’re used to peace, to policing and taxing, not fighting. How many of them\nhave won duels? How many of them carry more than a few pebbles?”\nHilo sighed. “We’ve got our most green, and we’ve got some dead\nweight, same as them.”\nShe turned to face him. Wen possessed features that were not\nconventionally beautiful but that Hilo found endlessly interesting—wide\nfeline eyes and dark slanted eyebrows, a slyly lascivious mouth and almost\nmasculine jawline. When she was particularly serious, as she was now, he\nthought she ought to be the subject of an art photography portrait—her\nstraight gaze so coolly intense and enigmatic it defied a viewer to guess if she\nwas thinking about sex or murder or grocery shopping.\n“Have you stopped in to the Academy lately?” she asked him. “You could\ngo see your cousin, take a look at the year-eights. Get a feel for which ones\nyou can use when they graduate next year.”\nHilo brightened. “You’re right—it’s been a while since I’ve paid Anden a\nvisit. I’ll do that.” He pinched her nipples gently, gave her a final kiss, then\nstood up and reached for his clothes. He hummed as he pulled on his pants\nand adjusted the sheath of his talon knife. “That boy is really going to be\nsomething,” he declared, buttoning his shirt in front of the closet mirror.\n“Once he gets his jade, he’ll be like a Green Bone out of a legend.”\nWen smiled as she pinned up her hair. “Just like his Horn.”\nHilo winked at her flattery.\nCHAPTER\n6\nHomecoming\nK\naul Shaelinsan arrived in Janloon International Airport with the vaguely\nhungover cotton-headed feeling symptomatic of all thirteen-hour flights.\nCrossing the ocean, staring out the window at the passing expanse of blue,\nshe’d felt as if she were turning back time—leaving behind the person she’d\nbecome in a foreign land and returning to her childhood. She was confused\nby the combination of emotions this aroused in her: a poignant, bittersweet\nmixture of elation and defeat.\nShae collected her baggage from the carousel; there wasn’t much. Two\nyears in Espenia, an unaccountably expensive university degree, and all her\nworldly possessions fit into a single red leather suitcase. She was too tired to\nsmile at this pathetic irony.\nShe picked up the receiver of a pay phone and began to deposit a coin into\nthe slot, then stopped, remembering the bargain she’d made with herself. Yes,\nshe was returning to Janloon, but she would do so on her own terms. She\nwould live as an ordinary citizen of the city, not like the granddaughter of the\nTorch of Kekon. Which meant not calling her brother to send a chauffeured\ncar to pick her up from the airport.\nShae replaced the phone receiver in its cradle, caught off guard by how\neasy it had been to slip into old behaviors within minutes of setting foot on\nKekon.

        "text": "easy it had been to slip into old behaviors within minutes of setting foot on\nKekon. She sat down on a bench in the baggage claim area for a few minutes,\nsuddenly reluctant to take the final steps through the revolving exit doors.\nSomething told her that when they spun her around and pushed her out, the\njourney would be irrevocable.\nFinally, though, she could delay no longer. She stood up and followed the\nstream of other passengers out to the taxi line.\nWhen she’d left two years ago, Shae had never intended to move back.\nShe’d been full of anger and optimism, determined to forge a new life and\nidentity for herself in the great wide, modern world beyond Kekon, away\nfrom anachronistic clans and the outsized male egos of her family. Once in\nEspenia, she found it harder than she’d expected to escape the stigma of\nbeing from a small island country known mostly for one thing: jade. Indeed,\nShae learned that the name Janloon often provoked blank looks. The\nforeigners called it something else: Jade City.\nWhen people abroad learned she was Kekonese, their reactions were\ncomically predictable. Initially, surprise. Kekon was an exotic, make-believe\nplace in the minds of most Espenians. The postwar boom in global trade was\nreversing its centuries of isolation, but not yet entirely. She might as well\nhave said she was from outer space.\nThe second response: eager jesting. “So can you fly? Can you punch\nthrough this wall? Show us something amazing. Here, break this table!”\nShe’d learned to take it with grace. At first, she tried to explain. She’d left\nall her jade back on Kekon. She was no different from them now. Whatever\nadvantages in strength, speed, and reflexes she possessed were accounted for\nby the fact that she still woke early and trained on her apartment patio every\nmorning. Lifelong habits persisted, after all.\nThe first two weeks had been almost unbearable, the feeling of being in a\ndeprivation chamber of her own making. Everything so much less than it\nused to be—less color, less sound, less feeling—a washed-out dreamscape.\nHer body slow, heavy, achy. A nagging suspicion of having lost something\nvital, like looking down and noticing you were missing a limb. The nighttime\npanic and the sensation of being adrift, of the world not being real.\nIt would all be bad enough even if she wasn’t surrounded by boisterous\nyoung Espenians who had the attention span of monkeys and were always\ntalking about clothes, cars, popular music, and the vagaries of their shallow,\nconvoluted relationships. She almost relented; she even booked a flight back\nto Kekon after the first term. But pride overcame even the near-debilitating\nhorror of jade withdrawal. Fortunately, the flight had been refundable.\nIt was far too complicated to explain to her few college friends what it\nmeant to be jaded, to come from a Green Bone family, and why she’d given it\nup—so she just smiled innocently and waited until their curiosity waned.\nJerald always teased her. “You walk around acting all normal, but one day\nyou’re going to bust out doing some crazy shit, aren’t you?”\nNo, she’d already done that. He was the crazy shit."

He was the crazy shit.\nThe sky was that odd mixture of haze and waning light. The concrete was\ndamp with Northern Sweat—the incessant drizzle and mist that pervaded the\ncoastal plain around Janloon during monsoon season. It was late, past\ndinnertime. Shae stood in line and waited for a taxi. The other people in line\ndid not pay her any attention. She was dressed in a colorful, short summer\ndress that was fashionable in Espenia but felt too clingy and garish in her\nhome country, but excepting that, she blended in, looked just like any other\ntraveler. Jadeless. It was with relief and a twinge of self-pity that she realized\nthere was little chance anyone would recognize her.\nThe next taxi arrived. The driver put her suitcase in the trunk as Shae\nclimbed into the back seat and rolled down the window. “Where to, miss?” he\nasked.\nShae considered going to a hotel. She wanted to shower, to decompress\nfrom the long flight, to be by herself for a little while. She decided against\nshowing such disrespect. “Home,” she said. She gave the driver the address.\nHe pulled away from the curb and into the streaming jostle of cars and buses.\nAs the taxi crossed the Way Away Bridge and the steel and concrete\nskyline of the city came into view, Shae was struck by a sense of nostalgia so\nprofound she found it difficult to breathe. The humid air through the open\nwindow, the sound of her native language being spoken on the radio, even the\nterrible traffic … She swallowed, close to tears; she had only the vaguest idea\nof what she was going to do in Janloon now, but she was undeniably home.\nWhen they entered the Palace Hill neighborhood, the taxi driver started\nglancing back at her in the rearview mirror, eyes flicking up every few\nseconds. When the taxi arrived in front of the tall iron gates of the Kaul\nestate, Shae rolled down the window and leaned out to speak to the waiting\nsentry.\n“Welcome home, Shae-jen,” said the guard, surprising her with the now-\ninaccurate suffix as well as the sense of familiarity in attaching it to her given\nname. The guard was one of Hilo’s Fingers. Shae recognized his face but\ncould not remember his name, so she merely nodded in greeting.\nThe taxi drove through the gates to the roundabout in front of the main\nhouse. Shae reached for her purse to pay the driver, but he said, “There’s no\nfee, Kaul-jen. I’m so sorry I didn’t recognize you at first in those foreign\nclothes.” He turned around to smile at her with earnest hopefulness. “My\nfather-in-law is a loyal Lantern Man. Lately, he’s having a little business\ntrouble. If there was a way you—”\nShae pressed the money into the driver’s hands. “Take your fee,” she\ninsisted. “I’m only Miss Kaul now.

Tell your\nfather-in-law to send word up the proper channels to the Weather Man.” She\nsuppressed her guilt at the man’s disappointed expression, got out of the taxi,\nand hefted her suitcase up the steps to the entrance.\nKyanla, the Abukei housekeeper, met her at the door. “Oh, Shae-se, you\nlook so different!” She hugged Shae and held her out at arm’s length. “And\nyou smell Espenian.” She laughed gaily. “But I shouldn’t be surprised, now\nthat you’re a big-shot Espenian businesswoman.”\nShae smiled weakly. “Don’t be silly, Kyanla.”\nThrough sheer workaholic grit, she’d graduated in the top third of her\nclass despite the fact that she’d been studying in her second language and,\nhaving been schooled at Kaul Du Academy, found the Espenian classroom\nenvironment utterly bewildering. So much sitting around in large rooms and\ntalking, as if every student wanted to be the instructor. In the spring, she’d\ninterviewed with some of the big companies that recruited on campus. She’d\neven received an offer for an entry position at one of them. But she’d seen\nhow the interviewers looked at her.\nWhen she walked into the room, the men around the table—they were\nalways men—assumed she was Tuni, or Shotarian, and the first glimmer of\nprejudice would come into their eyes. When they looked at her résumé and\nsaw she was from Kekon, that she’d been raised to be a Green Bone, their\nexpressions would cloud with outright skepticism. The Espenians might be\nproud of their military might, but they had little regard for her martial\neducation. What use would it be in a civilized, professional place like an\nEspenian corporation? This wasn’t Kekon, where the name Kaul was golden;\nthe right word from grandfather wouldn’t get her anything. In those moments,\nher romantic notions of making it on her own felt foolish. Foolish and lonely.\nNow, here she was: back in the house she hadn’t been able to leave fast\nenough a couple of years ago.\nLan was standing at the bottom of the staircase. He smiled. “Welcome\nhome.”\nShae went to him and embraced him tightly. She hadn’t seen her older\nbrother in two years and was overwhelmed by the rush of affection she felt\nfor him. Lan was nine years older than she; they had never been playmates,\nbut he had always been kind to her. He’d defended her from Hilo, had not\njudged her when she’d left, and had been the only member of the family to\nwrite to her while she was studying in Espenia. Sometimes, his letters, in\ntheir precise, even handwriting, had felt like the only link she had to Kekon,\nthe only evidence that she had a family and a past.\nGrandda is not doing so well, he’d ended simply at the end of his last\nletter.

With the sting of splitting from Jerald still as fresh as an oozing\nburn, she’d reread her brother’s letter, turned down the lone job offer, and\nbooked a flight back to Janloon.\nLan hugged her back and kissed the center of her forehead. Shae said,\n“How’s Grandda?” at the same time he said, “Your hair.” They both laughed,\nand Shae suddenly felt as if she’d let out a breath she’d been holding for two\nyears.\nLan said, “He’s waiting for you. Do you want to go up?”\nShae took a deep breath, then nodded. “I don’t suppose it’ll get any easier\nif I wait.” They climbed the stairs together, his hand on her shoulder. So close\nto him, she could feel the tugging hum of his jade, a barely perceptible\ntexture in the air that her body responded to with a yearning squeeze of the\nstomach as she leaned in closer to him. It had been such a long time since\nshe’d been affected by jade that she felt light-headed. She forced herself to\nstraighten away from Lan and face the double doors before her.\n“He’s gotten worse lately,” Lan said. “Today’s a good day, though.”\nShae knocked. Kaul Sen’s voice came back with surprising vigor through\nthe door. “I could Perceive you, you know, even without your jade, coming\nthrough the door and dawdling your way up here. Come in, then.”\nShae opened the door and stood in front of her grandfather. She should\nhave changed her clothes and showered first. Kaul Sen’s piercing gaze took\nin her bright, foreign attire, and the corners of his eyes tightened in a mess of\nwrinkles. His nostrils pinched, and he leaned back in his chair as if offended\nby the smell of her. “Gods,” he muttered, “the last couple of years have been\nas unkind to you as they have been to me.”\nShae reminded herself that despite his tyrannical faults, her grandfather\nhad been one of the most heroic and respected men in the country, that he\nwas now old and lonely and deteriorating, and that two years ago, she had\nbroken his heart. “I came straight from the airport, Grandda.” Shae touched\nher clasped hands to her forehead in the traditional sign of respect, then knelt\nin front of his chair, eyes downcast. “I’ve come home. Will you please accept\nme as your granddaughter again?”\nWhen she looked up, she saw that the old man’s eyes had softened. The\nstiffness of his mouth melted and his lips trembled slightly. “Ah, Shae-se, of\ncourse I forgive you,” he said, even though she hadn’t actually asked for\nforgiveness. Kaul Sen held out his gnarled hands, and she took them as she\nstood. She felt his touch like an electrical jolt; even at his advanced age, his\njade aura was intense, and the bones of her arms prickled in memory and\nlonging.\n“The family hasn’t been right without you,” Kaul Sen said. “You belong\nhere.”\n“Yes, Grandda.”\n“It’s all well and good to do business with foreigners. I said it so many"

I said it so many\ntimes, the gods know it’s true, I said it to everyone: We must open up Kekon\nand accept outside influence. I broke my brotherhood with Ayt Yugontin\nover it. But”—Kaul Sen stabbed a finger into the air—“we’ll never be like\nthem. We’re different. We’re Kekonese. We’re Green Bones. Never forget\nthat.”\nHer grandfather turned her hands over in his own, shaking his head sadly\nand disapprovingly at the sight of her bare arms. “Even if you take off your\njade, you won’t be like them. They’ll never accept you, because they’ll sense\nyou’re different, the way dogs know they’re less than wolves. Jade is our\ninheritance; our blood isn’t meant to mix with others.” He squeezed her\nhands in a papery gesture meant as comfort.\nShae bowed her head in silent acquiescence, concealing resentment of her\ngrandfather’s obvious pleasure that Jerald was now a fixture of the past.\nShe’d met Jerald on Kekon. At the time, he was stationed on Euman Island\nwith fifteen months left in his deployment and plans to go to graduate school\nafterward. The instant Kaul Sen learned of Shae’s relationship with a foreign\nsailor, he furiously proclaimed it doomed. Even though his reasons had been\nmostly racist—Jerald was Shotarian (even though he was born in Espenia),\nhe was a water-blooded weakling who was beneath her, he was a shallow\nbastard—it galled Shae that the old man’s prediction had proven true. Come\nto think about it, the shallow bastard part had been correct as well. “I’m glad\nto see you looking so healthy, Grandda,” Shae said mildly, trying to derail his\nmonologue.\nHe waved away her attempt at redirection. “I haven’t touched a thing in\nyour old room,” he said. “I knew you’d come home once you’d gone through\nthis phase. It’s still yours.”\nShae thought quickly. “Grandda, I’ve been such a disappointment to you.\nI couldn’t presume I’d have a place in the house. So I rented an apartment not\nfar from here and sent my things there already.” It wasn’t true; she’d made no\nliving arrangements and had no things to send. But she certainly didn’t relish\nthe idea of moving back into her childhood bedroom in the Kaul house, as if\nnothing had been gained or changed by two years and an ocean of distance.\nLiving here, she would have to endure the jade auras of Green Bones coming\nand going, and her grandfather’s condescending forgiveness. She added,\n“Besides, I could use a little time by myself to get settled. To decide what to\ndo next.”\n“What is there to decide? I will talk to Doru about which businesses will\nbe yours.”\n“Grandda,” Lan interrupted. He’d been standing at the entrance of the\nroom, watching the exchange. “Shae’s come off a long flight. Let her unpack\nand rest. There’ll be time to talk business later.”"

There’ll be time to talk business later.”\n“Huh,” said Kaul Sen, but he let go of Shae’s hands. “I suppose you’re\nright.”\n“I’ll come back to see you soon.” She leaned in to kiss his forehead. “I\nlove you, Grandda.”\nThe old man grunted, but his face glowed with a fondness she realized she\nhad desperately missed. Unlike Lan, she had never known their father; Kaul\nSen had been everything to her when she was a little girl. He had doted on\nher, and she on him. As she left the room, he mumbled after her, “For the\nlove of all the gods, put your jade on. It hurts me to look at you like that.”\nShe walked outside with Lan. They were alone. The sun had set, leaving a\nsmoggy afterglow that outlined the roofs of the buildings positioned around\nthe central courtyard. Shae sank onto a stone bench next to the draping maple\ntree and heaved a deep sigh. Lan sat down next to her. For a second they\ndidn’t speak. Then they glanced at each other and both laughed weakly.\n“That could have gone worse,” she said.\n“Like I said, he was in a good mood today. The doctor says he needs to\nstart wearing less jade, but that’s a battle I’ve been putting off.” Lan looked\naway for a second, but Shae caught the wince that flashed across his face.\n“How’s Ma?” Shae asked.\n“She’s doing well. She likes it out there. It’s very peaceful.”\nLong ago, their mother had resigned herself to a life of single parenthood\nand catering to her demanding father-in-law in exchange for a secure and\ncomfortable life as the respected widow of the No Peak clan’s ruling family.\nAs soon as Shae had turned eighteen, Kaul Wan Ria had retired to the\nfamily’s coastal cottage home in Marenia, a three-hour drive south from\nJanloon. To Shae’s knowledge, she’d not been back to the city since.\nLan said, “You should make the trip out to visit her. No rush—once\nyou’re settled.”\n“And you?” Shae asked. “How’re you doing?”\nLan turned his face toward her, his left eye narrowed. Everyone said that\nhe looked like their father, but Shae didn’t see it. Her brother had a steadfast\nand soulful manner, not like the ferocious-looking guerrilla in the old\nphotographs on her grandfather’s wall. He seemed about to say something to\nher, then appeared to change his mind and said something else. “I’m fine,\nShae. Clan business keeps me busy.”\nGuilt washed in. She hadn’t been reliable about responding to Lan’s\nletters when she’d been in Espenia; she could hardly expect him to confide in\nher now. She was not even sure she wanted his confidence, not if it meant\nhearing about territorial disputes, or misbehaving Lantern Men, or Fists that\nhad been killed in duels—clan things she’d told herself she would keep out of\nfrom now on. Nevertheless, she thought about how her brother had been"

Nevertheless, she thought about how her brother had been\nshouldering the position of Pillar while coping with Eyni leaving him and\ntheir grandfather’s dramatic decline, with only Hilo and nasty old Doru to\nhelp him. “I haven’t been here for you,” she said. “I’m sorry.”\n“You have to live your own life, Shae.”\nThere was no reprimand in his voice, and Shae gave thanks to the gods\nthat Lan was the first member of the family she’d met upon returning. He\ndidn’t make her feel ashamed for leaving, nor ashamed for returning. That\nwas more than she deserved—and more than she could expect from the rest\nof her family.\nThe jet lag was catching up, and she was exhausted now. The lights went\non in the house and then dimmed; Kyanla’s shape moved in the upper\nwindows, drawing shut the blinds. In the dark, the motionless outlines of the\nbenches and trees Shae had played around as a child seemed coolly\nremonstrative, like aloof relatives. She realized that Kekon had a special\nsmell, a certain indescribable, spicy, sweaty fragrance. Was that what she’d\nsmelled like to all her Espenian classmates? She imagined the odor seeping\nback into her pores. She put a hand on Lan’s arm. His jade aura coursed\naround her like a low bass vibration, and she leaned in closer, but not too\nclose.\nShae checked into a hotel room in the city and spent the next three days\nsearching for an apartment. Though she didn’t want to be too near the Kaul\nhome, it wasn’t as if she could live wherever she wanted. She could take off\nher jade but not her face or her name; there were parts of the city it would be\nbest for her to avoid. Even confining the search to districts firmly in No Peak\ncontrol, she spent from dawn until past dusk taking the malodorously\ncrowded subway from stop to stop, sweating ferociously in the summer heat,\nvisiting one building after another.\nThis could be a whole lot easier, she griped to herself more than a few\ntimes. The right word from Lan to a Lantern Man landlord would’ve yielded\nher a well-appointed apartment in no time. The rent would be half what it\nreally was, if that, and the landlord would rest assured that some building\npermit or construction contract he’d been waiting on would be approved right\naway. She held fast to her pledge to do without family help. She’d lived\nfrugally as a student, and when converted, the Espenian money she’d saved\nfrom her summer internship last year would be more than enough to cover six\nmonths of rent in Janloon if she was judicious. By the end of the third day of\nsearching, she was sore-footed and weary but had signed for a modest though\nconvenient one-bedroom loft in North Sotto and was pleased with herself.\nHilo was waiting in the lobby of the hotel when she returned. He was\nslouched in one of the overstuffed leather armchairs, but when he saw Shae\ncome in, he sat up, and the Fist that was with him—one of the Maik brothers,\nShae couldn’t remember which one—got up from the chair next to him and"

Hilo was her senior by a mere eleven months; when she’d left,\nthey’d been equals, of a sort. Now she was unemployed, single, and jadeless.\nHe was one of the most powerful men in Janloon, with hundreds of Green\nBones at his command.\nShe’d known she couldn’t avoid this moment but had told herself it could\nwait a little longer. Had Lan told him where to find her, or had the hotel staff\ntipped off his Fingers? As he rose to greet her, Shae braced herself. A hotel\nlobby was really not the place she’d pictured doing this. “Hilo,” she said.\nHe embraced her with great affection. “What are you doing here in a\nhotel? Are you avoiding me?” He sounded genuinely hurt; Shae had forgotten\nhow sensitive he could be sometimes. He put his hands on either side of her\nface and kissed both her cheeks and her forehead. “I’ve forgotten the past,”\nhe said. “Everything’s forgiven, now that you’re back. You’re my little sister,\nhow could I not forgive you?”\nHe sounded like Grandda, she thought, with his forgiveness. No\nforgiveness on his part, of course, for calling her a whore and a clan traitor,\nand volunteering, in front of her, Lan, and grandfather, to kill Jerald if given\nthe word. If Jerald hadn’t been an Espenian military officer, and Lan hadn’t\nbeen in the room to talk everyone down, Kaul Sen might very well have\ngiven it, too.\nPart of her was determined to stay angry at Hilo. It would’ve been easy if\nhe was still furious at her. But Hilo’s magnanimity was like his jade aura—\nfierce and unequivocal. She felt its warmth gathering her in, thawing the\ntension she was carrying like armor plating in her back and shoulders. “I\nwasn’t avoiding you,” she said. “I just got in and needed some time to get\nsettled, that’s all.”\nHe took a step back from her, still holding on to her elbows. “Where’s\nyour jade?”\n“I’m not wearing it,” she said.\nA frown marred Hilo’s face. He leaned in and lowered his voice. “We\nneed you, Shae.” He brought his eyes level with hers, fixing her with an\ninsistent gaze. “The Mountain is going to come after us. All the signs point to\nit. They think we’re weak. Grandda just sits there and never leaves the house.\nI don’t trust Doru far enough to spit on him. With you back, though, things\nwill be different. Grandda always liked you best, and with the two of us\ntogether behind Lan—”\n“Hilo,” she said. “I’m not getting involved. Just because I’m back in\nJanloon doesn’t mean I’m in the clan business.”"

Just because I’m back in\nJanloon doesn’t mean I’m in the clan business.”\nHe tilted his head. “But we need you,” he said simply.\nA few cruel words at this moment would drive him away. She itched to do\nit—to hurt him, to reject him, to provoke him—but she was tired of their old\nrivalry. Fighting Hilo was a crutch, an addictive bad habit she’d had all her\nlife, one she’d tried to leave behind along with her jade, and did not want to\nreturn to. They were both adults. She had to remind herself that he was now\nthe Horn of No Peak. If she was going to live on Kekon for any length of\ntime, it wouldn’t do to be on his bad side.\nShae quelled her defensiveness. “I’m not ready,” she said. “I need to\nfigure things out for myself for a while. You can try to respect that, can’t\nyou?”\nA few expressions battled openly on Hilo’s face; he appeared to be\nholding his disappointment in check as he attempted to judge her sincerity.\nHe had come to her, all smiles and brotherly warmth, and when Hilo put\nhimself forward freely, he expected the same of others. Meeting him less than\nhalfway was risky. When he spoke again, his voice was more measured.\n“All right. Take the time you need, like you said. But there’s nothing to\nfigure out, Shae. If you don’t want to be a Kaul, you shouldn’t have come\nback.” He raised a finger before she could reply. “Don’t argue; I don’t want\nto forget that I’ve forgiven you. You want me to leave you alone for now, I\nwill. But I’m not as patient as Lan.”\nHe walked away, his jade aura rapidly receding from her like a strong\nwave sweeping back out to sea. “Hilo,” she called after him. “Say hello to\nAnden for me.”\nHer brother half turned his head to speak over his shoulder. “Go say hello\nto him yourself.” His lieutenant slid her a remonstrative look as the two of\nthem disappeared into the warm night beyond the doors of the hotel.\nCHAPTER\n7\nKaul Dushuron Academy\nE\nven in the shade, sweat trickled down the backs and faces of the year-eight\nstudents. Ten of them stood nervously, each behind a short tower of hot\nbricks. “One more,” said the master, and the assistant year-threes hurried to\nthe fire pit with tongs, carefully but quickly removing bricks from the flames\nand placing another on top of each of the ten smoldering stacks. One of the\nwaiting year-eights, named Ton, muttered quietly, “Ah, what to choose, pain\nor failure?”\nTon had undoubtedly intended the question for his classmates and not\nmeant for it to be overheard, but Master Sain’s senses were sharp.\n“Considering that if you fail to pass the Trials at the end of the year, you’ll\nnever wear another pebble of jade again in your life, I would venture to say\npain,” he answered drily. The schoolmaster glared down the row of hesitating\npupils. “Well? Are you hoping for the bricks to cool?”"

        "text": "pain,” he answered drily. The schoolmaster glared down the row of hesitating\npupils. “Well? Are you hoping for the bricks to cool?”\nEmery Anden rubbed the training band around his left wrist, more out of\nhabit than any real need for additional contact with the jade stones studded\ninto the leather. He closed his eyes, trying to grasp and focus the uncommon\nenergy only a small percentage of Kekonese ever learned to manipulate. A\nchoice between pain or failure, indeed, as Ton had put it. Unleashing proper\nStrength would break the bricks, but exerting Steel would prevent him from\nbeing burned by the blistering hot clay. Unless, as this exercise was meant to\ninstruct, a person could do both: use Strength and Steel in conjunction. A\ntruly skilled Green Bone, of the kind Anden and all his classmates desired to\nbe, could call upon any of the six disciplines—Strength, Steel, Perception,\nLightness, Deflection, and Channeling—at any time.\nNext to Anden, there was a resounding crack and a muffled yelp of pain\nfrom Ton. This isn’t as hard as algebra, Anden reassured himself, then\nslammed the heel of his hand into the center of the top brick. It crumpled into\nthe one underneath it, and that one into the one beneath it, in a cascading\nwave of force that lasted only a second but that Anden felt clearly like a line\nof slowly toppling playing cards, the impact shuddering back up in the other\ndirection as well, dispersing into his arm, shoulder, and body. He pulled his\nhand away at once, snapping eyes open and examining his hands.\n“Hold them out,” said Sain, sounding nearly bored. He paced down the\nrow of students, rubbing the back of his pebbly skinned neck with\ndisappointment. “I see some of you will be spending your break time this\nafternoon visiting the infirmary,” he said, wrinkling his nose at the blistered\nhands. He kicked an unbroken brick on the ground. “Others will be bruising\nyourselves in remedial Strength training.” He came to the end of the row,\nlooked down at Anden’s six broken bricks and unburnt hands, and grunted—\nthe closest thing to praise the deputy headmaster ever offered.\nAnden kept his eyes humbly on the cracked bricks in front of him.\nSmiling or relishing personal success would be an uncouth thing to do, and\neven though Anden had been born on Kekon and never been off it, he was\nalways on guard against giving the impression of being foreign in some way;\nit was an old and unconscious impulse he’d had all his life.\nSain clapped his hands together. “Put your bands away. I’ll see you next\nweek, when we’ll do this again until you improve or are too crippled to\ngraduate.”\nThe trainees touched clasped hands to their foreheads, stifling groans and\nshuffling aside for the year-threes who came forward to clean up the rubble.\nAnden turned away, unbuckled the training band from his wrist, and stowed\nit in its case. Then he squatted down, steadied himself against a wall, and\nsqueezed his eyes shut as the crash hit. Higher jade sensitivity meant worse\njade withdrawal, even from short exposure.

Sometimes it took Anden twice\nas long as other students to recover, but he was practiced now. He breathed\nand forced himself to relax through the disorienting sensation of the world\nbeing torn out from under his feet, everything going dim and fractured around\nthe edges, before finally righting and settling into a duller normalcy. In under\na minute he had it under control and stood back up, shouldering his bag.\n“I heard a grunt from Sain over there,” said Ton, submerging his hand in\nthe basin of cool water a pair of the year-threes had dutifully brought over to\ntheir seniors. “Nicely done, Emery.” The name came out sounding Kekonese:\nEm-Ri.\n“My bricks were thinner,” Anden replied politely. “How’s your hand?”\nTon winced, wrapping his palm in a towel and holding his arm stiffly\nacross his stomach. He was a scrawny boy, shorter than Anden, but his\nStrength was excellent. Jade was strange that way; sometimes it was a skinny\nwoman who could bend a metal bar, or a big, heavy man with the Lightness\nto run up a wall or leap from a roof—more evidence if there needed to be any\nthat the abilities jade unlocked were something other than physical. “I wish\nmedical Channeling worked better on skin wounds,” Ton said, glum. “Had to\nhappen right before Boat Day, too.” He paused, glancing up at Anden. “Hey,\nkeke, a few of us are planning to hit up the bars in the Docks before the ship\nsinking next week. You want to come, if you don’t have other plans?”\nAnden had the distinct feeling he was being invited as an afterthought—\nthat was often the case—but of course he did not have other plans, and he\nthought that perhaps Lott Jin would be part of the group going, so he said,\n“Sure, that sounds good.”\n“Great,” said Ton, “see you then.” He cradled his burn and started across\nthe field toward the infirmary. Anden began to walk in the opposite direction,\ntoward the dormitories, musing as he went. After more than seven years at\nthe Academy, he’d grown accustomed to existing in a respectable but\nsomewhat lonely social borderland that only he inhabited, one in which he\nwas never actually excluded, but never actively included either. His\nclassmates were all cordial to him (they had to be), and he could count Ton\nand a few others as real friends, but Anden knew he made many of his peers\nfaintly uncomfortable in more ways than one and didn’t expect complete\nacceptance.\nPau Noni, one of the other year-eights, jogged up to him from across the\nfield, her face flushed from the humid midday heat. “Anden! You have a\nvisitor waiting for you out front.” She pointed down the path toward the\nAcademy’s entry pavilion.\nA visitor?

Anden’s\nschoolbag bounced against his shoulders as he loped across the training field.\nThe small east field was one of several on the sixty-acre campus. Kaul\nDushuron Academy was built on a hill in Widow’s Park. Although the\nbustling city of Janloon and its suburbs extended on all sides, the Academy’s\nhigh walls, and the old elm and camphor trees that shaded the long, single-\nlevel buildings, separated the grounds from the metropolis and preserved the\nfeel of a traditional Green Bone training sanctuary. The Academy was Kaul\nSen’s legacy, a tribute to his son, but even more profoundly, it was one of the\nmost visible pieces of evidence that Green Bone culture had cemented itself\ninto a central position in Kekonese society. When he stopped to consider it,\nAnden could appreciate that the Academy was as much a symbol as it was a\nschool.\nAs he came to the small rock garden behind the main entrance, Anden\nslowed. A man was sitting on one of the low retaining walls, slouched in a\nposture of boredom. He wore tailored beige pants and his shirt sleeves were\nrolled halfway up his forearms; his jacket was draped on the wall next to him.\nAt Anden’s approach, the man rose to his feet with languid grace, and Anden\nsaw that it was Kaul Hilo.\nA nervous sensation crept around Anden’s chest.\n“You look surprised to see me, cousin,” said Hilo. “You didn’t think I’d\nforget to come wish you a happy birthday, did you?”\nAnden had turned eighteen a few days prior. The day had gone\nunacknowledged, as personal celebrations were considered gauche and\nfrowned upon by the Academy’s instructors. Anden recovered and touched\nclasped hands to his forehead in respectful greeting. “No, Kaul-jen, it’s just\nthat I know you’re busy these days. I’m honored you’d pay me a visit.”\n“I’m honored, Kaul-jen,” Hilo mimicked, his voice exaggeratedly stiff.\nThe left side of his mouth curled into a teasing smile. “What’s with all the\nformality, Andy? This place isn’t sanding you flat, is it?” Hilo spread his\narms wide. “It didn’t work on me.”\nYou’re a Kaul. The whole school is named after your father. There was\nprivilege even among jadeless initiates; anyone with a different lineage or\nless talent would have been expelled for the number of misdemeanors Hilo\nhad accumulated as a trainee. Now he was the Horn of No Peak. Go figure.\nAnden tried to relax in his cousin’s presence. Hilo was nine years older\nbut appeared not to have aged at all since graduating, so passersby might\nhave guessed them to be of similar age. “How’s Grandfather?” Anden called\nKaul Sen his grandfather, just as he called the younger Kauls his cousins.\n“How’s Lan-jen?”\n“Ah, they’re their usual Pillar-like selves.” Hilo sauntered toward him.\nAnden slung the pack off his shoulders, hastily removed his glasses, and\nstuffed them into a side pocket. They were new frames and he didn’t want—"

They were new frames and he didn’t want—\nHe barely had time to toss the bag behind him; Hilo grabbed him quick as\na monkey snatching fruit, hands closing and rotating like metal vises on\nAnden’s wrist and elbow. In a single violent twisting movement, he\nwrenched the younger man toward the ground.\nAnden went with the momentum, dropping and sinking his weight to\nslacken the arm lock; he pulled his cousin close as they staggered together.\nHilo kneed him in the side, twice, energetically, and Anden wheezed, folding\nup, clutching at Hilo’s arms with the limp-limbed sway of a religious\nsupplicant. His forehead bounced off the other man’s shoulder.\nThe sharp taste of jade energy filled his mouth. Hilo’s jade. Clinched this\nclose, its resonance washed over Anden—humming, throbbing, pulsing with\nHilo’s every heartbeat, breath, movement. Blood pounded into Anden’s\nbrain; it wasn’t a true jade rush, but it was something like it. He grasped for it\nurgently, trying to hang on to the rippling edges of his cousin’s aura, like\nclinging to steam. When Hilo moved to knee him again, he used the second\nof imbalance and drove a straight palm strike into Hilo’s sternum with\nenough Strength to make him let go and stumble back several paces.\nHilo’s smile stayed in place; he danced a couple of steps to the side, then\ncame back at Anden with light-footed menace. Anden braced himself. He\ncouldn’t run from Hilo; that was not an option. No matter how badly he\nexpected to be beaten. Hilo struck him in the body with blindingly fast,\nplayful blows that left Anden reeling and biting back whimpers. Anden\nsmacked the next punch out of the way, shuffled in on an angle, just inside\nHilo’s range, and sheared his arm across his cousin’s bicep, driving past his\nguard and smacking him under the chin with the ridge of his open hand.\nHilo’s head snapped back; he stumbled and coughed. Anden didn’t\nhesitate—he punched his cousin in the mouth. Hilo said, “Wow.” He spun\nand buried a solid kick in Anden’s stomach with enough Strength that the\nyounger man was thrown from his feet and landed on his back in the gravel.\nAnden groaned. Why are we doing this? He was only a student, prohibited\nfrom wearing jade outside of supervised training sessions. Hilo was a\npowerful Green Bone. The odds were not even remotely even. Of course, that\nwas hardly the point. He scrambled unsteadily back to his feet and kept\nfighting; he had no choice, not if he wanted to avoid being beaten to a smear.\nThey’d attracted spectators. A number of nearby younger initiates had\nmigrated over to get a better view of the Academy’s top senior student being\nknocked around by the Horn of No Peak. Hilo seemed to enjoy the audience,\nglancing at the students occasionally with tolerant amusement. Anden was\nsuddenly, absurdly concerned that the bystanders who did not know Hilo\nmight assume he was angry or cruel. They might not notice the way he"

They might not notice the way he\nmoved with a relaxed air, a friendly attentiveness on his face, as if he and\nAnden were having a conversation over lunch instead of beating on each\nother.\nAnden took Hilo’s punishment and gave back all he had; he attacked the\nribs and kidneys, he bloodied his cousin’s face again, he even stooped to\ngoing for the knees and groin. Finally, though, Hilo swept him to the ground\nand pinned him with a knee between the shoulders, and Anden lay staring\nsideways at the world and breathing dirt, unable to move, wishing it had been\nanyone in the family besides Kaul Hilo that had shown up this afternoon.\nHilo rolled off Anden and sat on the ground beside him, legs extended,\nleaning back on his arms. “Whew,” he said. He lifted the front of his\nexpensive-looking shirt and wiped his face, leaving sweat and blood stains.\n“Less than a year before you graduate, Andy. I have to take advantage of this\ntime while I can. Lan used to beat the shit out of me when he was jaded and I\nwasn’t yet, did you know?”\nLan, Anden did not say out loud, thought you were crazy. Lan had told\nAnden before that Hilo would attack his older brother, insist on fighting him\neven though Lan was eight years his senior, larger, and jaded. Lan had no\nchoice but to beat him near senseless on more than one occasion.\n“Once you have your jade, you’ll get me back. Look at you now. I’m a\nGreen Bone. I’m the fucking Horn of the clan. And you gave me this”—he\npointed to his bloody lip—“and this”—he touched a swollen lump on his\nhead—“and this.” He lifted his shirt and showed Anden the dark bruise on his\ntorso. He dropped the shirt back down and grinned so cheerfully it made\nAnden stare. “I always knew you were something special. You could feel the\njade on me, couldn’t you? Could use it, even. You know how rare that is? At\nyour age? Just think what you’ll be like when you get your own green.”\nAnden appreciated his cousin’s praise but did not feel nearly so proud of\nhis performance. He hurt. He felt like a mouse that had been batted around by\na bored tiger for several hours. He wondered: Was it because he was not full-\nblooded Kekonese that he didn’t find this remotely as fun as his cousin did?\nThe Kekonese, so the gross ethnic stereotype went, couldn’t say no to any\ncontest of prowess. One could not go to any sizable social gathering without\nsome physical duel breaking out—anything from spitting seeds into cups, to a\nheated game of relayball, to actual fights. It was customary politeness after\nsuch matches (which were usually benign but sometimes deadly serious) for\nthe victor to voice a self-deprecating comment (“The wind was in my favor,”\n“I had more to eat today”) or to extend some praise that allowed his opponent\nto save face (“You would be unbeatable with better shoes,” “Lucky for me"

        "text": "“I had more to eat today”) or to extend some praise that allowed his opponent\nto save face (“You would be unbeatable with better shoes,” “Lucky for me\nyour arms were sore”), no matter how minor or unlikely the explanation.\nSo it was possible Hilo was just being polite in his approval. Anden didn’t\nthink that was the case, though. No, this had been Hilo’s way of relating to\nhim, measuring what he was made of, whether he was the sort of person who,\noutmatched and with no hope of winning, gave in or fought until he was no\nlonger able.\nHilo got to his feet and brushed off his pants. “Take a walk with me.”\nAnden wanted to explain that he really ought to go to the infirmary.\nInstead, he struggled to his feet, picked up his dusty schoolbag, and limped\nsilently along beside his cousin as the man strolled down the rock garden\npath. Now, apparently, they could talk.\nHilo pulled out two cigarettes and offered one to Anden. He lit Anden’s\nfirst, then his own. “You’ll have to start out as a Finger like everyone else;\nthat’s just the way we do it. But if all goes well, you’ll be a Fist in six\nmonths. I’ll give you your own territory, your own people.” Their spectators\nhad dispersed. Hilo looked across to the far end of the field where some older\nstudents were lining up for training exercises. “You have to pay attention this\nyear and start thinking about which of your classmates you’ll want as your\nFingers. Skill is important, but not everything. You want the ones who are\nloyal and disciplined. Who won’t start shit but won’t take any either.”\nThe combination of the adrenaline crash and Hilo’s words made Anden’s\nfingers shake. He took a drag on the cigarette. “Kaul-jen,” he started.\n“Godsdamnit, Andy. Do I have to beat you up some more? Stop talking to\nme like that.” He threw his arm around Anden’s shoulders. Anden flinched,\nbut Hilo pulled him in and gave him a fierce kiss on the cheek. “You’re as\nmuch my brother as Lan is. You know that.”\nAnden felt a rush of embarrassed warmth. He couldn’t help glancing\naround to see if anyone had witnessed Hilo’s outburst of affection.\nHilo noticed, and teased, “What, are you worried about them getting the\nwrong idea? ’Cause they know you like boys?” When Anden stared at him,\nstunned, Hilo laughed. “I’m not stupid, cousin. Some of the most powerful\nGreen Bones in history were queers. You think it matters to me? Just don’t\nforget: Soon you’ll have to be careful about who you’re with, who might be\neying you for your green.”\nAnden sat down heavily on the stone retaining wall. He fished the glasses\nfrom the pocket of his bag and tried to wipe some of the sweat-muddied dirt\noff his face before putting them back on. His cousin’s advice seemed silly; he\nwas not in any romantic relationship and there were times he was resignedly\nconvinced he might never be.

        "text": "convinced he might never be. He wasn’t inclined to share that sentiment with\nthe Horn, though, and besides, he had more pressing anxieties related to his\nfinal year before graduation. “Hilo,” he said slowly, “what if I can’t handle\njade after all? What if it’s not in me? I’m only half Kekonese.”\n“The half you have is plenty,” Hilo assured him. “Some foreign blood\nmight even make you that much better.”\nJade sensitivity was a tricky thing. Only the Kekonese had the right\namount of it to be Green Bones. Anden’s mixed-race parentage made him a\nborderline case. More sensitive, no doubt, which with the proper training\nmight mean stronger ability—or might mean a lethal propensity to the Itches.\n“You know my family history,” Anden said quietly.\nA group of children carrying buckets and shovels was being led across the\nfield by an instructor. They staggered with fatigue under the hot sun but knew\nbetter than to complain. The first two years at the Academy consisted of\nconstant studying and demanding physical labor mingled with consistent,\ngradual jade exposure; these children wouldn’t even begin studying the six\ndisciplines until they were year-threes. Jade tolerance was built up through\nrigorous mental and physical conditioning, just like a muscle in the body, but\nbeyond that there was an element of luck and genetics. There was no telling\nwhy some Green Bones could naturally carry a heavier load of jade without\never suffering the terrible side effects, while others could not.\nHilo scratched an eyebrow with his thumb, his other hand still on Anden’s\nshoulder. “Your family history? Your grandda was a war legend; your uncles\nwere famous Fists. They say your mother could Perceive a bird flying\noverhead and Channel from such a distance that she’d stop its heart in\nmidair.”\nAnden stared at the tip of his burning cigarette. That was not what he’d\nbeen thinking of. “They called her the Mad Witch.”\nOne night when he was seven years old, Anden had found his mother\nsitting naked in the bathtub in the middle of the night. It had happened after a\nhot day in the middle of summer, he remembered that—one of those\nscorchers when people iced their bedsheets in the evening and hung wet\ntowels in front of fans. He’d gotten up to pee. The light in the bathroom was\non, and when he walked in, he saw her sitting there. Her hair was hanging in\nlimp, wet strands over her face, and her shoulders and cheeks were shiny\nunder the yellow glow. The only thing she was wearing was the three-layered\njade choker she never took off. The bath was half full, the water pink with\nblood. Anden’s ma looked up at him, her expression blank and confused, and\nhe saw that she held a cheese grater in her hand. The skin of her forearms was\nshredded, the flesh exposed like ground beef.\nAfter a moment that felt as if it would never end, she offered him a small,\nsheepish smile. “I couldn’t sleep; I was too itchy. Go back to bed, my little.”\nAnden ran from the room and called the only person he could think of:\nKaul Lanshinwan, the young man who was often at their house, his uncle’s"

Lan and his grandfather\ncame and took Anden’s mother to the hospital.\nIt was too late for her. Even after they sedated her and removed all the\njade on and near her, she could not be saved. When she awoke, she thrashed\nin her restraints, screamed and cursed them, called them dogs and thieves,\ndemanded they give her back her jade. Anden sat in the hallway outside of\nhis mother’s hospital room, his hands clapped to his ears, tears running down\nhis face.\nShe died a few days later, screaming until the end.\nEleven years later, the memory still crept into Anden’s nightmares. When\nhe was anxious or doubtful, it resurfaced. Waking unsettled in his dorm\nroom, he couldn’t bring himself to get up and go to the bathroom. At such\ntimes, he would lie staring into the darkness with his bladder aching and his\nthroat dry, his skin prickling with a psychosomatic, insidious fear that his\nblood carried a curse that meant he, too, was fated to die young and deranged.\nPower ran in his family; so did madness. It was why, even though the Kauls\nhad encouraged him to, he had never changed his name, preferring to keep\nthe foreign name of Emery, which meant nothing to anyone, over his\nmaternal family name, Aun, which came loaded with expectations of\ngreatness and insanity, neither of which Anden desired for himself.\nAfter the death of Anden’s mother, Lan had spoken to his grandfather.\nWithout any ceremony, the Kauls took Anden in, made him part of the\nfamily, fed and housed him until he was ten years old and of age to be sent to\nKaul Dushuron Academy with Kaul Sen’s money and blessing. So it came to\nbe, remarkably, that the ruling family of No Peak was all the family Anden\nhad. His mother’s side had flamed out in tragedy. His father was nothing\nmore than a distant memory: a uniformed blue-eyed man who had fled back\nto his faraway country, to pale-haired women and fast cars.\n“Your ma, she had a bad life—it started bad and it ended bad,” Hilo said.\n“You won’t be like her. You’re better trained. You have all of us watching\nout for you.” He stubbed out his cigarette. “And if you really need it, there’s\nSN1 now.”\n“Shine,” Anden said, calling it by its street name. “Drugs.”\nHilo wrinkled his nose in contempt. “I’m not talking about the stuff that\njade-fevered wannabes brew up in dirty labs to sell to weaklings and\nforeigners on the streets. Military-grade SN1, what the Espenians parse out to\ntheir own special ops guys. It’ll take the edge off the sensitivity, give you a\nbit of a buffer, if you need it.”\n“They say it’s poisonous and easy to overdose, that it’ll take years off\nyour life.”\n“If you’re an untrained, water-blooded foreigner shooting it up all the"

Everyone’s different,\nyou don’t know what wearing jade will be like for you yet. I’m not saying\nyou’ll need help, I’m just saying it’s there. We can get it for you no problem,\nif you need it. You’re a special case. There’s no shame in that, Andy.”\nOnly Hilo was partial to calling him by that foreign-sounding nickname.\nAt first it had annoyed Anden, but he didn’t mind it now; he’d grown to\nappreciate that Hilo thought of it as something special between the two of\nthem. Anden noticed that his cigarette had burned down. He ground it out and\nput the stub in his pocket so as not to litter the rock garden and earn any\nreprimands. “I wonder if shine would’ve saved my ma.”\nHilo shrugged. “Maybe, if it had been available back then. But your ma\nhad a lot of other problems—your da leaving, your uncle offing himself—\nthat might’ve pushed her over the edge anyway.” He studied Anden with\nconcern. “Hey—why are you so worried all of a sudden? You’re going to be\na Green Bone soon, don’t look so fucking glum. I’d never let anything\nhappen to my little cousin.”\nAnden hugged his bruised torso. “I know.”\n“And don’t forget it,” said Hilo, leaning against the wall. “By the way,\nShae says hello.”\n“You talked to her?” Anden was surprised. “Is she back now?”\nBut Hilo was unsmiling now and gave no indication he’d heard the\nquestion. Instead of answering, he muttered, “We’re going to need you soon,\nAndy.” He scanned the grounds, as if noting the number of students. Most of\nthem were already affiliated in some way with the clan—the children of\nGreen Bones and Lantern Men. The Academy was largely a feeder into No\nPeak the same way its rival, Wie Lon School, was a feeder into the Mountain.\n“Soon, we’re going to need every loyal initiate we can get,” Hilo went on.\n“Lan wouldn’t want me saying this to you, but you ought to know. The truth\nis Grandda’s got more than one screw loose and a few toes in the grave. Ayt\nYu is dead, and that tough bitch Mada is coming after us. There’s trouble on\nthe way with the Mountain.”\nAnden regarded his cousin with concern but didn’t know what to say. All\nsummer there’d been rumors around campus that tensions were growing\nbetween the clans. So-and-so’s older brother was a Finger who’d been\ninsulted by someone in the Mountain and a duel was sure to follow. Someone\nelse’s aunt had been evicted after her building was taken over by a real estate\ndeveloper affiliated with the rival clan. And so on. But it wasn’t anything that\nAnden hadn’t heard before, off and on over the years. There were always\nminor clan disputes going on.

Closed off as he was in the Academy, the\nimpending trouble Hilo spoke of seemed distant to Anden, something that\nconcerned his cousins but was not anything that would affect him personally\nuntil he graduated next spring.\nHe was wrong. It came for him the next week.\nCHAPTER\n8\nBoat Day Encounter\nI\nt came as a result of going to piss alone.\nThe beginning of Kekon’s typhoon season was always marked by Boat\nDay, and the conclusion of it, three months later, with the Autumn Festival.\nBoat Day is a holiday centered on bribing the petulant typhoon god, Yofo,\nwith enough destruction to satisfy him for the coming year and forestall any\nEarth Scourers—the fiercest types of storms, capable of ripping up trees,\nleveling villages, and triggering landslides. Children and adults build paper\nboats (as well as matchstick houses and model cars), and destroy them with\nmuch fanfare—lighting them on fire and blasting them with hoses being a\ncommon method, but throwing them from high places and crushing them\nwith bucketfuls of rocks and mud also being practiced. On Boat Day evening,\nJanloon harbor became the site of a staged naval battle, complete with flames,\nbooming cannons, and sailors leaping overboard, ending with the ceremonial\nsinking of one or two old ships.\nAnden had seen the harbor spectacle enough times during childhood that\nhe didn’t feel the need to see it again, but he took up Ton’s offer to go down\nto the waterfront with several classmates to take in the general revelry. In\norder to instill a spirit of austerity and discipline, the Academy served\nmodest, bland meals, prohibited alcohol, and gave the students few days off,\nso on special holidays the year-sevens and year-eights, who were allowed to\nleave campus unsupervised, tended to overindulge, eating and drinking\nthemselves sick before, in time-honored tradition, being browbeaten and\npunished by unsympathetic masters the next day. Anden, Ton, and three\nothers, Lott, Heike, and Dudo, visited four bars in the Docks, ate half a dozen\nvarieties of street food from the boardwalk vendors, and by midafternoon\nwere debating whether to stay put and watch the boat sinking or fight their\nway upstream against the current of arriving spectators.\nAnden’s bladder was full to bursting with no toilet facilities in sight. It\nwas hot and humid, as usual, and over the last half hour he’d been consuming\na great deal of soda while blaming his weak Espenian blood for the fact that it\ndidn’t take much hoji—Kekonese date liquor—to make him light-headed.\n“Let’s go back up there. I need to piss,” he said, before realizing that he was\nspeaking to no one in particular. Dudo was vomiting into a public garbage\nbin. Ton was standing next to him, offering moral support. Heike and Lott\nwere having a heated argument about relayball.\nAnden waited and watched them for a minute. Heike was taller, had nicer\narms, and was arguably the better-looking of the two, but there was\nsomething about Lott Jin that always drew Anden’s attention.

        "text": "something about Lott Jin that always drew Anden’s attention. A sulky but\nsensual curve to his bow-shaped mouth, slightly wavy hair that hung over\nunsmiling eyes hooded with long lashes. A sort of animal idleness in the\nmovements of his well-proportioned body that made it seem as if he held\neverything in faint disdain.\nSince the relayball argument was not reaching a conclusion and none of\nthe others appeared ready to move anytime soon, Anden decided he had\nbetter see to his own needs. Rather than fight the crowds jostling for the best\nharbor view, he went farther down the boardwalk until it ended in the ferry\ndock that ran boats to the outlying islands of Euman and Little Button. One\nwould think there ought to be a restroom at the dock, but such was not the\ncase. Anden crossed the street and jogged three more blocks before spotting a\nfried bread joint on the corner. Mumbling apologies as he pushed past the\nqueue of people at the counter, he rushed into the restroom and shut the door,\nsighing with relief as he mumbled a quick prayer to Tewan, god of\ncommerce, to bless the owners of the Hot Hut fried bread eatery.\nTo exit the small establishment, he again jostled through a crowd of\nteenagers loitering by the door. A young man near Anden’s own age jostled\nhim back roughly and said, “You’re not going to buy something?”\n“Excuse me?”\nThe teen jerked his head toward the Hot Hut, his eyes not moving from\nAnden. “You take a piss in there and don’t buy anything? You don’t like\nfried bread? It’s the best in town. You should be more respectful, keke.”\n“He’s not really a keke,” said another of the teens lazily, swallowing a\nbite of his own piping hot stick of fried bread and sizing Anden up with an\noutthrust jaw. “He’s a mongrel, and he’s in the wrong part of town.”\nAnden glanced at the window of the Hot Hut and understood his mistake\nat once. In his haste, he’d crossed from the Docks into the Summer Park\ndistrict. There was a paper lantern hanging over the cashier’s counter, but it\nwas pale green, not white. He was in Mountain territory, and he was wearing\na shirt in Kaul Du Academy colors.\nHe had almost no money left on him, and the last thing his overstretched\nstomach wanted was fried bread. “You’re right,” Anden said. “I’ll go in and\nbuy some bread.” He took a step back toward the queue of customers.\nThe first teen gave Anden’s shoulder a shove and squared his body in\nchallenge. “Not in that ugly shirt, you’re not.” A smirk crept over his acne-\nscarred face. “Give it over. We’ll accept it as your tribute to Wie Lon School\nand hang it over the urinals.”\n“I’m not giving you my shirt,” Anden said, but he was uneasy now.\nAlthough he was eighteen, he was still a student with no jade of his own, not\nyet a man by the custom of his kind. Green Bones, governed by the honor\ncode of aisho, were forbidden from killing any family members of their\nenemies who did not wear jade. Unfortunately, the code did not constrain the"

Unfortunately, the code did not constrain the\njadeless members of rival clans and schools. They were free to do what they\nwanted to him. Anden had been taught from a young age to never leave No\nPeak territory alone. Silently, he cursed his drunken classmates, his fifth shot\nof hoji, and his own carelessness.\nThere were three of them: the acne-pocked leader, his skinny friend, and\nthe third thus far silent teen who was younger, perhaps fifteen or sixteen, but\nalready bigger and heavier than the others. They closed in on Anden together,\nfalling into natural positions that made Anden certain they’d skirmished\ntogether before. The leader in the center hung slightly back; the skinny friend\nand the larger boy circled to either side. “Touch your head to the ground and\ngive us your shirt, mongrel,” said the leader. “And then say that Kaul Du\nAcademy is a school of thin-blooded shit eaters and bastards.”\nThe other boys giggled. Returning with a bloodied Academy shirt and a\ngood story of a beating well-delivered would earn the boys considerable\nstatus among their peers at Wie Lon. Anden did not back away, but others did\n—the entire line of waiting customers shifted to the right like a snake,\nwrapping around the Hot Hut and giving the four of them a great deal more\nspace on the sidewalk. The woman taking orders at the front of the counter\nrose up on her tiptoes and shouted at them, “Shoo! Shoo! Not in front of the\nglass doors!” She waved her arms to gesture them away.\nAnden used the momentary distraction to attack first. He feinted right,\nthen stepped left and clocked the skinny one across the face in a three-beat—\nleft fist, folded left elbow, back across the jaw with the right heel of the palm\n—dropping him quickly.\nIt was better this way. He couldn’t run without shaming his school,\nshaming Hilo, and he couldn’t win—not without jade against three\nopponents, two of them larger than him. They wouldn’t do more than beat\nhim, though—not in public, not on Boat Day, not if he fought well enough to\nbe respected.\nAnden seized his falling opponent by the shoulders and pivoted, spinning\nhim around and sending him sprawling into the path of the charging leader.\nThe biggest boy came up fast from behind, grabbing Anden in a powerful\nbear hug, pinning his arms to his sides while the acne-faced teen leapt over\nhis fallen friend and began burying punches in Anden’s sides and stomach.\nAnden grunted at the bursts of pain; he sank his weight down sharply,\nkicking back at the large boy’s shin and stomping his heel down on the top of\nhis canvas shoe. The teen let out a curse and lifted his foot out of the way just\nas Anden drew up his own legs and thrust both his feet hard into the leader’s\nchest.\nHis opponent stumbled backward toward the door of the Hot Hut, tripping\nover his fallen classmate’s legs, but was caught and shoved back by the\npeople he crashed into.

He rolled away fast, but\nbefore he could scramble back onto his feet, the boy’s meaty arms encircled\nhis waist and dragged him to the ground like an anchor, while the recovered\nleader fell upon Anden, raining blows.\nHe felt only two of the punches connect with his cheek and ear when the\nattack stopped and the weight of his assailants was abruptly lifted off him.\n“What do you think you’re doing?” demanded a man’s voice. Anden looked\nup to see a dark-complexioned Mountain Green Bone hauling all three Wie\nLon boys to their feet. They winced, cowed, no match for his Strength as he\ndragged them together like misbehaving puppies. “You little shits,” he said.\n“It’s Boat Day. Look at that park over there full of people. There are tourists\nhere, and Wie Lon School students are rolling on the ground scuffling like\ndogs. What the fuck.”\n“We were teaching him a lesson, Gam-jen,” whined the leader. “He’s a\nKaul Du brat, and mixed blood to boot. Besides, he hit us first.”\nA different voice, slow but deep, like a bear roused to displeasure, said,\n“Is that how future Fingers address Fists?” Anden looked up at the approach\nof a man he had never seen but recognized at once from reputation alone.\nThe teenagers became contrite. “No, Gont-jen,” they murmured, eyes\ndowncast. The leader said, a little sulkily, “Forgive us if we’ve overstepped.”\nGont Aschentu, Horn of the Mountain, dispersed the crowd with his sheer\nsize and air of dangerous authority. He turned his square chin to look down at\nAnden, then turned it fractionally toward the Wie Lon teenagers. “Leave\nnow.”\nThe three young men hastily touched clasped hands to foreheads as they\nbacked away and fled, glancing over their shoulders as they went. Anden got\nto his feet, trying to adjust his bent glasses frames to sit straight. Faced with\nthe Horn of the Mountain, he almost wished his three attackers would come\nback. Anden clasped his hands and raised them in a wary, deeply respectful\nsalute. “Gont-jen.”\n“You’re Anden Emery,” said Gont, his use of the foreign naming\nconvention making Anden wince inwardly. “The son of Aun Uremayada.\nAdopted by the Kauls.”\nAnden hesitated. “Yes, Gont-jen.”\nGont Asch had a distinctive appearance. He was bald, with thick limbs\nand a thick neck, and thick jade-encrusted armguards. He possessed the\nappearance of a powerful thug, the kind of Horn who would bark orders and\nprofanities, who would maim first and ask questions later. In truth, he was\nsoft-spoken, and it was said that his brutish appearance concealed a keen and\npatient cunning. “I’m told you’re one of the best students at the Academy,”\nhe rumbled, still looking at Anden.

He could try\nto run, but it was ridiculous to think he could move faster than a Green Bone\nlike Gont Asch. “There’s no need to be afraid,” said the Horn with an\nundercurrent of amusement in his low voice. “I know you’re not a man yet.”\nHeat rose into Anden’s face and blotted out his mounting alarm. He\nturned his head slowly to stare at the arm Gont had placed on his shoulder.\nEach piece of jade on the man’s armguard had been carefully arranged to\nform the abstracted but recognizable design of a river. The river was sacred;\nit brought down water for life, and jade for power. It was mild and\nharmonious, but glutted with monsoon rain it was unstoppable and deadly.\nAnden could feel Gont’s many gemstones tugging at his blood like a\ngravitational force. He raised his eyes to the man’s face. “I’m not afraid. My\ncousins, however, might not trust your intentions.”\nGont laughed, an oddly soft chuckle, as a gleaming ZT Valor pulled up to\nthe curb. “Get in,” said the Horn, opening the back door. Anden suddenly felt\nweak in the knees, but Gont’s arm was steering him unerringly into the\nvehicle. “Don’t worry about the Kaul brothers. We’ll be sure to let them\nknow you’re in our company.”\nWith a great deal of misgiving, Anden got into the back seat of the boxy\nblack sedan. Gont got in after him and shut the door. They began moving.\nThe driver of the ZT Valor—a ferrety man with a thatch of white hair and\nflakes of dandruff on his dark silk shirt—pulled the car through a number of\nside roads out of Summer Park.

        "text": "flakes of dandruff on his dark silk shirt—pulled the car through a number of\nside roads out of Summer Park. The car turned onto Patriot Street and began\nspeeding west. Despite his situation, Anden stared out the window with great\ncuriosity. He’d been raised to think of certain parts of Janloon as enemy\nterritory and was a little disappointed to see that they did not look any\ndifferent from the rest of the city: bustling streets and shops, construction\ncranes, shiny new buildings and muddy old shacks, dogs sleeping in the\nshade, foreign cars gliding past people balancing packages on bicycles. The\nordinary people, the ones who were not Green Bones, moved freely around\nJanloon, so why would he have expected it to look like a different country?\nHe edged surreptitiously down the seat, trying to put more space between\nhimself and Gont Asch’s bare shoulders, which were massive and densely\ncrisscrossed with raised white scars. The lore of how Gont had received his\nscars was well known, and the man clearly found it in his interest to wear\nsleeveless shirts that reminded people of it frequently. In the chaos of the\nearly postwar days, a number of criminal gangs arose in Janloon, causing\ntrouble in the streets and challenging the surviving, war-weary Green Bones.\nA few of these gangs acquired jade, which was not as strictly controlled back\nthen as it was currently, and thus grew reasonably powerful even as the Itches\nswept through their ranks like an epidemic. A young Gont Asch found\nhimself on the wrong side of such a gang and was one night ambushed and\ndragged before its leader.\nGont demanded a clean-bladed duel but was refused. He raised his bare\nknuckles and insisted on a “death of consequence”—a Green Bone’s right to\ngo down fighting instead of submitting to execution. Gont had been disarmed\nand the gang members were carrying knives, machetes, and hatchets. The\ngang leader smiled at the young man’s bravado, but stopped smiling once the\nfighting began. Gont’s talent in Steeling was unparalleled. He resisted a\nstorm of cuts and took an opponent’s weapon, then went on to kill all eight of\nthe gang leader’s men. It was said that the gang leader fell to his knees,\nclasped his hands to his head in salute, and swore an oath of allegiance to\nGont Asch and the Mountain clan. Gont remained, to anyone’s knowledge,\nthe only living man to have walked away from a death of consequence.\n“Turn that off,” the Horn said. From the front passenger seat, Gam\nreached over and switched off the opera song playing on the radio, causing\nsilence to suddenly fill the interior of the car and settle uncomfortably into\nthe summer heat that the open front windows did little to dispel. Gont shifted\nhis bull-like frame and looked at Anden with steady interest. At last he said,\n“I met your grandfather once, and your mother. It was about twenty years\nago. The Auns were exceptional warriors, so gifted I think the gods didn’t\napprove of such power in mortals and later sent bad luck to stalk them. I was\na boy at the time, younger than you, though already a Finger—we didn’t have\nthe luxury of much schooling back in those days.”\nAnden blinked and said nothing, taken aback by the turn of conversation."

        "text": "a boy at the time, younger than you, though already a Finger—we didn’t have\nthe luxury of much schooling back in those days.”\nAnden blinked and said nothing, taken aback by the turn of conversation.\nIt was hard not to be drawn in by the Horn’s even and articulate baritone\nvoice, which was quite amicable and relaxed, like that of a very good radio\ndrama narrator. A counterpoint to the unnerving scale of the man’s physical\npresence.\nGont went on. “The country was disorderly in those days. Growing and\nrebuilding like mad, but a stinking mess. The Green Bones kept the peace,\nmade sure criminals and the foreigners didn’t take over, but in the middle of\nall that, Ayt Yu and Kaul Sen had a falling out and divided the great One\nMountain Society. I remember the Auns were among the most vocal in\nwanting Ayt and Kaul to reconcile their differences and keep Green Bones\nunited under one clan.\n“In the end, your grandfather sided with the Kauls, but the Aun family\nwas divided in its loyalty. Your uncle went to the Academy and became the\nclosest friend of Kaul Lan, but your mother went to Wie Lon Temple School.\nIf she’d lived and had her say, you would be swearing oaths to the Mountain\nthis year.”\nAnden kept his eyes forward; his jaw was firmly clenched. What was\nGont playing at? “My mother didn’t have a say,” he replied stiffly. “Kaul Sen\ntook me in after she died. I owe him for my education, for the jade I’ll wear\nwhen I graduate.”\nGont shrugged, a motion that rippled his shoulders. “The Torch of Kekon\nis an old man now. You ought to consider whether your debt to him\nconstrains you to being an underling of Kaul Hilo.” Up until now, Gont’s\neven voice had given away very little, but now it slipped, leaving no doubt of\nhis disdain for the other Horn.\nThe car had turned onto a road that was winding its way up into the hills.\nLush greenery rolled past on both sides, occasionally broken by roadside\nstands with weathered paint, and private lanes barred by rusty metal gates.\nAnden tried to keep his growing anxiety out of his voice. “Where are you\ntaking me?”\nGont settled back, depressing the seat. “To the top of the Mountain.”\nCHAPTER\n9\nSkirting Aisho\nL\nan was in a meeting with Doru and two prominent Lantern Men when\nDoru’s secretary interrupted them, knocking apologetically and squeaking,\n“I’m so sorry, but, Kaul-jen? There’s a man on the phone asking for you. He\nsays it’s urgent.”\nThe Pillar frowned; perhaps it was someone from the Espenian\nambassador’s office again, expecting to sweet-talk or bribe him into shifting\nhis stance on the jade export quotas. He excused himself and stepped out of\nthe door that Doru’s secretary held open for him. She smiled shyly at him.\nLan did not know her name. The Weather Man seemed to go through\nsecretaries quickly. This one was especially girlish, wearing an almost\ntransparent pink blouse through which Lan could see her black bra. She\nhurried ahead of him to her desk and transferred the waiting call to his office."

        "text": "secretaries quickly. This one was especially girlish, wearing an almost\ntransparent pink blouse through which Lan could see her black bra. She\nhurried ahead of him to her desk and transferred the waiting call to his office.\nLan did not really think of it as his office, though it was reserved for his\nuse whenever he wished to conduct business out of it. It sat unoccupied the\nrest of the time. The top floor of the No Peak–owned office tower on Ship\nStreet in Janloon’s Financial District boasted an incomparable view, but it\nwas the Weather Man’s domain. Lan preferred his study in the Kaul house.\nHe picked up the phone and took the call off hold. “Kaul-jen,” said a deep\nand unhurried man’s voice. “We have your young friend, Anden. We crossed\npaths with him at the Boat Day festivities. No rules have been broken. We’re\njust having a talk with him, a very cordial and civilized talk. In three hours,\nhe’ll be released in the Temple District, near the traffic roundabout. You have\nno need to be concerned for his safety … so long as no one in No Peak\noverreacts. I am referring to your Horn.”\nLan said, “I understand.” He knew he was speaking to a member of the\nMountain clan; no one else would dare this. He suspected the man on the line\nwas Gont Asch, though he could not be certain. Lan steadied himself against\nthe desk and made his voice iron in its calm. “Trust me on this: I will hold\nyou to your assurances.”\n“Don’t worry about Anden. He’s been most respectful and polite. Worry\nabout your brother turning this into a bad situation.” The caller hung up.\nLan depressed the receiver cradle on the phone and looked at his jade-\nbacked wristwatch, making a note of the exact time. Then he released the\nphone switch and immediately dialed his brother’s house, knowing it was\nhighly unlikely he would find Hilo there. As expected, he received no\nanswer. He phoned the main house and told Kyanla to have Hilo call him at\nonce in his Ship Street office if she heard from him. Lan hung up and\npermitted himself a few seconds to calm down.\nThe Mountain’s sheer nerve astounded and angered him. If Ayt Madashi\nhad a message for No Peak, she could have arranged a meeting with Lan\nthrough the clans’ Weather Men. Or she could have shown respect by\nsending a member of her own clan to deliver a proposal. Either would have\nbeen proper. Abducting Anden, the only jadeless member of the immediate\nKaul family, and using him as a go-between skirted disturbingly close to\nbreaking aisho. It put the onus unfairly on Lan to prevent violence. The caller\nwas right; now he had to worry about his Horn. If Hilo found out Anden had\nbeen taken by the Mountain, his rage would be unpredictable.\nLan took out his address book and found the number for Maik Wen’s\napartment. Receiving no answer there either, he phoned both of the Maik\nbrothers without success until he remembered that it was Boat Day and\nHilo’s people were bound to be patrolling the waterfront and its\nestablishments.

He called the Twice Lucky and asked the owner, Mr. Une, to\nput him on the phone with the highest-ranked Green Bone he could find in or\naround his restaurant. A few minutes later, a man’s voice came on the line.\n“Who is this?” Lan asked.\n“Juen Nu.” One of Maik Kehn’s men.\n“Juen-jen,” said Lan, “this is the Pillar. I need to find the Horn\nimmediately. Call either of the Maiks if you know where they are and send\nany Fingers you have with you out running. Have my brother phone me at the\nWeather Man’s office as soon as he gets the message. Don’t start a panic, but\ndo it at once.”\n“Right away, Kaul-jen,” said Juen, sounding worried, then hung up.\nLan walked back to Doru’s office. He apologized to the two Lantern Men\n—real estate developers seeking clan approval, financial support, and help\nwith expediting permits for a new condominium complex—and sat back\ndown, no longer paying much attention to the meeting. He was worried about\nAnden. The young man was like a true nephew to him, and Lan felt a great\ndeal of responsibility for him. He still remembered holding Anden’s hand,\ncomforting the grieving boy, bringing him into the Kaul house and telling\nhim that this was his home now. Lan believed Gont had been sincere about\nnot harming Anden, but things might change. The Mountain might hold him\nhostage if something went wrong. Where the hell was Hilo?\nDoru would have to lack all sense of Perception to not notice the\naggravation that had come into Lan’s jade aura. Sure enough, the Weather\nMan wrapped up the meeting as quickly as possible without appearing openly\nrude. He promised the petitioners that the clan would take care of their\nbusiness needs with, naturally, an expectation that the Lantern Men’s tributes\nto No Peak in the future would reflect such patronage. The Lantern Men\ngathered their papers, saluted to Lan while gratefully reiterating their\nallegiance, and left the room.\n“What has happened, Lan-se?” Doru asked.\n“The Mountain has Anden,” Lan said. When he explained the situation,\nDoru blinked and made a skeptical smacking noise with his lips. “They can’t\nhave planned this. The boy is always in the Academy, out of reach. This is an\naggressive and opportunistic move on Gont’s part, but if they meant insult or\nharm, they wouldn’t have phoned to alert you. They must be sincere in\nwanting you to hold back Hilo.”\n“Are they truly?” Lan said, remembering something else. Last year,\nbusiness dealings between the Mountain and a minor clan called Three Run\nhad gone sour and turned violent, resulting in the Mountain annexing the\nsmaller clan. The story was that two Mountain men had picked up the fiancée\nof the Three Run Pillar’s son, driven her two hours outside of Janloon, and\nleft her by the side of the road to walk back in the dark without shoes. The\nenraged heir of Three Run had led his clan in an attack against Gont. It had\nended badly for him and his family."

It had\nended badly for him and his family.\nHilo often complained vociferously about things the Mountain was doing\n—skirmishes and territorial disputes that Lan left mostly to his brother’s\nattention—but now Lan considered the possibility that Gont snatching Anden\nmight be just like what the Mountain had done to Three Run. Not breaking\naisho explicitly but baiting their rivals into violence, then sweeping down in\nretaliation while claiming grievance.\nThe phone rang and Lan picked it up at once. Hilo said, “It’s me.”\n“Where are you?” Lan asked.\n“I’m in a phone booth outside of Gont’s nephew’s apartment building in\nLittle Hammer, and I’ve got twenty guys with me.” Hilo’s voice was low, but\nLan could hear the barely contained fury. “Gont’s got Andy. An informer in\nSummer Park saw a scuffle break out and said that dogfucking bastard drove\noff with my kid cousin in his car.”\n“Calm down,” Lan said. “I know about it. Gont called me. They’ll release\nAnden on the Temple District side of the traffic circle in about two hours.”\nHe was almost afraid to ask. “Have you done anything that might change\nthat?”\nA pause before Hilo said, “No. I have this godsdamned building\nsurrounded though and it’s going to stay fucking surrounded until I get Andy\nback without so much as one of his hairs out of place. Gont’s gone too\nfucking far. My own little cousin!”\nLan breathed out in silent relief. “He’s my cousin too, Hilo, and whatever\ngame the Mountain’s playing, we can’t give them any excuse to break aisho.\nKeep our guys under control and get over to the place they’re supposed to\ndrop him. The important thing now is that we get Anden back.”\nHilo breathed into the receiver harshly. “I know that,” he snapped, and\nhung up.\nDoru laced his thin fingers around one bony knee and said with a stiff-\nlipped smile, “I take it our Horn has not yet started a war, gods be thanked. If\nthe Mountain is indeed trying to provoke us, Hilo would play directly into\ntheir intentions. You’re quite right to keep a cool head.”\nThe Pillar did not reply; although he agreed with Doru’s words, he found\nthe man’s tone faintly condescending. Cold, careful judgment was the mark\nof a good Weather Man, but perhaps Doru’s commitment to peace between\nthe clans was blinding him. Hilo might be impetuous, but at least Lan could\ntrust that his first concern was also for Anden’s safety. Doru on the other\nhand had never formed any meaningful relationship with the adopted boy and\nseemed to be treating today’s events like a very interesting business\nnegotiation, instead of what Lan knew it to be: flagrant intimidation. The\nMountain showing that it could reach into the Kaul family.\nLan considered going over to the Temple District to join Hilo but decided\nit was more important to stay put in case the Mountain attempted to make\ncontact again. “Cancel the rest of the day’s meetings.

I’ll be in my office,” he\ntold Doru, then left to wait alone for news from the Horn.\nCHAPTER\n10\nThe Mountain House\nT\nhey took him to the Ayt mansion.\nAyt Yugontin, when he was Pillar of the Mountain, had fittingly chosen\nthe highest point of elevation in the city to build his residence and had\nendeavored to recreate the feel of a Green Bone training sanctuary like Wie\nLon Temple School in his own estate. The approach into the property looked\nlike the entrance to a forest fortress, but when Gont rolled down the car\nwindow and nodded to the two guards—his own Fingers, no doubt—the thick\ndoors swung open on silent automatic controls.\nAnden had never seen a house more impressive than the Kaul residence,\nbut the Ayt mansion was just as splendid in an entirely different manner.\nWhile the Kaul home was grand and modern, with both Kekonese and\nforeign-influenced architectural touches, the Ayt residence was classically\nKekonese—a sprawling single-story structure with stone facade and dark\nwooden timbers, swooping rooflines, green tiles, and wide walkways. It\nmight have been the home of a Kekonese landlord hundreds of years ago, if it\nwasn’t for the security cameras, motion sensors, and expensive imported cars\nin the driveway.\nThe ZT Valor pulled up to the front. Gont got out of the car. When the\ndriver opened the other rear door, Anden stepped out nervously and followed\nGont through the entrance of the house. Two Fingers stood to the side. They\nsaluted their Horn but gave Anden no more than a cursory glance; they could\nPerceive that he was not wearing jade.\nGont pointed to a padded bench standing against the wall near the front\ndoor. “Wait here and don’t move until you’re called,” he ordered Anden.\nWith no further explanation, he strode down the wood-floored foyer and\ndisappeared down a hallway.\nAnden sat down as he’d been told. Gazing around, he found it hard not to\nadmire the landscape artwork and the antique blades mounted on the walls,\neven as his palms kept sweating and his insides twisted themselves into\nknots.\nSurely he had been brought here as a hostage, to be held against the Kauls\nbecause of something that was going on between No Peak and the Mountain\n—the trouble that Hilo had spoken of last week. Should he have resisted, or\ntried to get away? He doubted it would have made any difference. What\nwould Lan do when he found out what had happened? What would Hilo do?\nThe threat of the Mountain hurting Anden or keeping him prisoner might\nprovoke violence between the clans. Was that what the Mountain wanted? He\nglanced around, wondering if he could escape this place, and noticed Gam\nstanding by the door with the guards, keeping a close eye on him. He didn’t\nknow all the key people in the Mountain, but he knew Gam was Gont’s\nSecond Fist and had a reputation as a formidable fighter. Anden remained\nwhere he was.\nA good deal of time passed, perhaps an hour. Long enough that Anden’s\nanxiety turned to boredom and then to impatience. Finally, Gont returned."

Finally, Gont returned.\n“Come with me,” he said, again with no explanation, and led the way back\ndown the hall. Anden hurried to keep up with his long, purposeful strides.\nAlong the way, they passed two men in suits walking in the opposite\ndirection. Glancing at them, Anden suspected one was Ree Turahuo, the\nWeather Man of the Mountain, as he’d heard that Ree was a short man. The\nother was probably one of his subordinates, or a highly regarded Lantern\nMan. Gont and Ree did not acknowledge each other. Interesting. Apparently\nNo Peak wasn’t the only clan in which the Weather Man and the Horn\nmaintained a frosty relationship.\nGont stopped outside a thick, closed door and paused, turning his broad\nshoulders toward Anden. “Don’t look so nervous,” he advised. “She doesn’t\nlike nervous men.” He pushed open the door and motioned Anden through.\nAyt Yugontin had perished without an heir. His wife and infant son had died\nin the war, buried under merciless tons of mud and earth when Shotarian\nbombs started a landslide that destroyed the small village that had been Ayt’s\nbirthplace.\nDuring the war, the people called Ayt the Spear of Kekon. He was the\ndaring, vengeful, ferocious Green Bone warrior that the Shotarians feared and\nhated, a man who spoke little but wreaked deadly havoc on the occupiers,\nonly to always escape into the shadows and up into the mountains.\nHis closest comrade, Kaul Sen, was the elder, more seasoned rebel, a\nshrewd and masterful tactician who, along with his son, Du, distributed secret\npamphlets and broadcast subversive radio messages that inspired and\norganized the network of Lantern Men that became the key to the One\nMountain Society’s success.\nThe Spear and the Torch.\nA year after the end of the war, Ayt Yugontin adopted three children,\norphans from his former village. Advocating that Green Bone abilities and\ntraditions needed to be preserved and passed on to future generations of\nKekonese, he gave all three adoptees—a teenage girl and two younger boys\n—a martial education at Wie Lon Temple School. The girl had undeniable\nnatural talent, despite beginning training late. The elder of the boys, Ayt Im,\nhad an ego greater than his skill and was killed in a duel of clean blades at the\nage of twenty-three. The younger, Ayt Eodo, had enough ability, but grew up\nto be vain, more interested in becoming a playboy and art collector than a\nclan warrior. His sister, Ayt Madashi, became the Weather Man of the\nMountain.\nAn hour after her father’s death, Mada killed the longtime Horn of the\nclan. This was followed immediately by the murder of three other rivals, all\nof them among the Spear’s closest friends and advisors. The Green Bone\ncommunity was stunned—not by the fact that she’d done it, but that she’d\ndone it so quickly and publicly, before her own father’s funeral.

Her opponents within\nthe clan clamored to Ayt Eodo, hoping he would return from his vacation\nhome in the picturesque south of the island and stand up to his sister’s\nrampage.\nThe Kekonese term “to whisper a man’s name” originates from the\noccupation period when the identities of foreign officials targeted for\nassassination were passed secretly through the rebel network. Ayt Mada\nwhispered the name of her adoptive brother, and a day later, Eodo’s mistress\nemerged from the shower to find him lying on the bed with his throat slit and\nhis jade gone.\nWhen the bloodshed was over, Ayt Mada sent a message to her father’s\nestranged comrade, Kaul Sen, expressing her deepest respect, her\ncondolences over the recent loss of his wife, her sadness over the\nunavoidably violent internal transition of power within the Mountain, and her\nutmost desire for the continuation of peace between the clans. Kaul Sen\ninstructed Doru to send a generous delivery of white heart blossom and\ndancing star lilies, symbolizing sympathy and friendship, respectively, to the\nfuneral of his old friend, addressed to his daughter, the Pillar.\nIn the two and a half years following, two minor clans threw in their lot\nwith the Mountain. The Green Winds clan did so willingly; its patriarch\nretired to the south of Kekon and its remaining leaders took positions within\nthe Mountain. The other was the Three Run clan, which was made to see\nreason when Gont Asch cut off the head of its Pillar.\nThe office of Ayt Mada was spacious, bright, and cluttered. Books and papers\nwere piled on the wall shelves, the desk, and the floor. Sunlight flooded in\nfrom the large windows. The space was divided in two: the office proper, and\na reception area with a sofa and brown leather armchairs. Ayt was sitting in\none of the armchairs, a short stack of file folders balanced in her lap. She was\na woman nearing forty years, in loose linen pants, a sleeveless green top, and\nsandals. She looked as if she had just come straight from a workout or\nbrunch. She wore no makeup, and her long hair was pulled back into a single\nfunctional ponytail.\nAnden wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting. He’d imagined that perhaps\nthe Pillar of the Mountain would be a glamorous and deadly femme fatale. Or\nperhaps a hard-bitten she-man who exuded toughness and iron authority.\nInstead, she appeared ordinary, except for the spectacular amount of jade\nrunning up both her arms. Mounted in coiling silver bracelets that twined up\nher forearms and biceps like snakes, there must have been at least a dozen\nstones on each arm. So much jade, worn so unpretentiously—Green Bones\nhad no need for any other symbols of status.\nWithout looking up, the Pillar said, “You made the call?”\nGont made an affirmative noise. “He understood. A reasonable man, as\nyou say. His brother has massed a small army in Little Hammer, but so far\nthey’re waiting.”\nAyt closed the file she was perusing and tossed the stack onto the polished"

His brother has massed a small army in Little Hammer, but so far\nthey’re waiting.”\nAyt closed the file she was perusing and tossed the stack onto the polished\nwooden coffee table. She motioned Anden to the sofa across from her\nwithout ceremony. Even with a short distance between them, Anden could\nfeel the woman’s jade aura—a steady, focused red intensity. In the center of\nthe coffee table was a bowl of oranges and a cast-iron teapot. “Tea?” Ayt\ninquired.\nCaught off guard, Anden didn’t answer immediately. Only when Ayt\nraised a gaze as formidable as her aura did he manage to say, “Yes, thank\nyou. Ayt-jen.”\nAyt opened a cabinet under the coffee table and brought out two small\nclay cups. She set one in front of Anden and one in front of herself. “It’s a\nfresh pot,” she explained, as if it were important that hostages were served\nhot tea and not stale, oversteeped dregs. She poured for herself first, then for\nhim. An honored guest, particularly a fellow Green Bone, would be served\nbefore the host, but Anden did not qualify as either. Anden glanced at Gont,\nwho settled his large frame into an armchair near Ayt’s. She did not offer to\npour him a cup, nor did he help himself; apparently he was not a party in this\nconversation and remained present only as a silent, disquieting observer.\n“I’m sure you’re wondering why you’ve been brought here.” Ayt did not\nwaste additional time with pleasantries. “We’ve taken a large risk in seizing\nthis opportunity to speak with you. After all, there’s a chance your adopted\nfamily might attribute dishonorable motives to our actions, when in truth they\nare entirely to your benefit.”\nAnden sipped just enough tea to wet his dry mouth. He was more\nperplexed than ever but sensed with trepidation that what was happening now\nwas different from what he’d initially suspected, a more complicated ploy\nthan merely holding him prisoner to provoke violence or to gain a concession\nfrom No Peak over some dispute.\n“I’m told you’re the best student at Kaul Du Academy,” Ayt went on.\n“When I was young, my father never allowed anyone with foreign blood to\ntrain at Wie Lon, but times are different now. I’m not like my father. I break\nfrom tradition when I see that there is cause to do so and when there is gain to\nbe had. I believe differences can be overcome; disagreements in the past can\nbe set aside. Your lineage is impressive, and even without the Kaul blood or\nname, you are a representative of the family.\n“I’m making you an offer to join the Mountain.”\nAnden’s heart began to pound. He knew both Ayt and Gont could\nPerceive his fear, though neither of their expressions changed. His reaction\nwas a sign that he understood what was happening, what was truly being said.\nBetraying his patron and his adoptive family by crossing over to the\nMountain would be suicide; he could never accept such an offer and they\nknew it. No, this was a thinly veiled proposition not to him, but to the Kauls\nthemselves, to the clan of No Peak. An opening position.\nThe realization that he’d been brought here to be a messenger at the"

An opening position.\nThe realization that he’d been brought here to be a messenger at the\nhighest level, that Ayt expected him to infer the import of her words and take\nthem directly back to Lan, filled Anden with a certain amount of relief. He\nwas not going to be harmed or imprisoned. Then, on the heels of that relief\ncame a burst of bewilderment and anger at the excessiveness of it all. Why\nforce him into a car instead of conversing somewhere neutral? Why provoke\nLan and Hilo to the brink of attack? Why include him at all?\nAnden imagined standing up, tossing his cup of tea into Ayt Mada’s face,\nand saying in a voice cold with disgust, “Kaul Lan would never kidnap a\njadeless student from Wie Lon School. The Pillar of No Peak would have the\ndecency not to play mind games like this.”\nOf course, Lan would not want him to do anything so stupid. He’d want\nhim to stay composed, pay attention, and return safely. Anden remained still,\nkeeping both his face and his voice calm as he responded, carefully, “I’m\nflattered, Ayt-jen.”\nAyt smiled at his discomfort. “I’m glad you understand the significance of\nsuch an unprecedented offer. You would be a Fist with many Fingers, in a\nposition of considerable status and responsibility. But not here in Kekon. In\nYgutan.”\nAnden blinked. “Ygutan?”\n“We’ve established vital new operations there. I need enterprising and\ntalented Green Bones to be in charge of our expansion in that country. You\nwould work under the Horn, but you would report directly to me.”\nYgutan was cold and desolate, the food was awful, and there wasn’t a\npebble of jade in the whole vast country. Why on earth would the Mountain\nwant to expand into Ygutan? Perhaps Perceiving his bafflement, Ayt lifted\nher lips in a thin smile. “The world is opening up. International trade is\nflourishing. Why should we Green Bones concern ourselves only with the bit\nof land that is Kekon when vast opportunity exists abroad?”\n“But … what’s in Ygutan?”\nAyt paused with the teacup below her mouth. “SN1 production.” She\nsipped and put the cup down. “We’re going to sell shine to the Ygutanians.”\nAnden was speechless. Shine was both illegal and reviled on Kekon. It\nwas a drug engineered by foreigners, a shortcut to allow jade to be worn by\nnon-Kekonese, by people without the hard-won tolerance that Green Bones\nproudly possessed. An entire civilization and culture was built around the\ninviolable truth that jade destroyed any wearer except the most worthy\nKekonese warriors.\nThe Espenians, arrogant and inventive beyond compare in the world, had\ncircumvented that. As soon as they’d established military bases on Kekon,\nostensibly to help their allies defend and rebuild after the Many Nations War,\nthey’d gone to work in secret labs to determine how their own soldiers could\nacquire the same legendary jade ability as Green Bones.

        "text": "acquire the same legendary jade ability as Green Bones. Ten years ago,\nthey’d succeeded, albeit imperfectly, by creating SN1.\nThe formula of the experimental serum had leaked from Espenian military\nbases on Kekon, and the illegal shine trade ballooned. Apparently a lot of\npeople, here and overseas, were willing to trade years of life for a dangerous\ndrug that allowed them to wear jade without being Kekonese, without putting\nin the years of hard training, and without dying horrible deaths from the\nItches. Less acknowledged, and universally scorned, was the fact that there\nwere some Green Bones who secretly used it, too, to artificially enhance their\nown natural jade tolerance.\nSN1 was a contentious topic among Green Bones. Anden had heard\narguments at school on occaison and even a debate in the Kaul house once,\nwith some firmly of the opinion that the drug was an unmitigated social ill\nand others contending that limited use was acceptable so long as it was by\nsanctioned, highly trained individuals such as Green Bones who might, due to\nillness or injury, for example, benefit from medicinal use to temporarily\nbolster tolerance.\nAnden wasn’t sure which side of the issue he fell on, especially given his\nown family history. Nevertheless, in his experience, the one thing everyone\nagreed upon was that the illegal spread of shine violated Green Bone interests\nand values and had to be eradicated. The fact that Ayt Mada, the Pillar of the\nlargest Green Bone clan in Kekon, was planning to sell shine was so\nastounding to Anden that when he was able to speak again, he forgot his role\nand his caution, and blurted, “You’re going to give more foreigners the\nability to wear jade? Isn’t that exactly what we don’t want?”\nHe realized his outburst had probably come across as disrespectful, but\nAyt seemed amused. “What we don’t want is to lose control. The Espenians\nalready use SN1 on their own soldiers. Other countries will aspire to follow\nsuit. Soon there will be an expanding population of foreigners wearing jade.”\nAyt leaned forward. Anden didn’t mean to, but he leaned away; the woman’s\njade aura and her straightforward gaze felt like solid surfaces pushing\nimplacably outward. “This could be the greatest threat we’ve ever faced, or\nan unparalleled opportunity. The faster Kekon speeds toward modernization,\nthe more vital it is that Green Bones take strict control of our own resources.\nWe can be driven out of our rightful place, or we can stand to profit greatly.\n“My father strived to keep the foreigners out, but let’s accept reality:\nThey’re here to stay. Kekon is no longer a mysterious backwater of\ncivilization. People around the world know about jade, and thanks to the\ninvention of SN1, now they can have it. Rather than try to fight the\ninevitable, let’s give them what they want. At a price we control, under\nconditions we control. The shine trade on Kekon has given us better\nknowledge of SN1 production than anyone besides the Espenians, and we can\nensure the security of the facilities we establish. If we develop the SN1\nsupply, then we decide the extent to which jade can be used by outsiders.”\nAnden felt entirely out of his depth. He made himself sit forward, reach"

If we develop the SN1\nsupply, then we decide the extent to which jade can be used by outsiders.”\nAnden felt entirely out of his depth. He made himself sit forward, reach\nfor his teacup, and swallow down the now lukewarm liquid. In doing so, the\nproximity of Ayt’s jade prickled his Perception for an instant. The Pillar’s\ntone was pleasant but firm. She didn’t sound threatening. But he sensed\nmenace. A dogged avariciousness.\n“Green Bones were once united against foreign threats. It’s time we were\nthat way again. Time that the clans came together in a new alliance. That’s\nwhy I’m proposing that you join us. The rewards would be great for you.”\nAyt sat back, and her expression shifted, became flat and chilling. “If you\nspurn the hand we’re holding out to you, well, that is your choice of course.\nJust remember that we’re extending this offer in good faith and complete\nhonesty. I strongly urge you to reciprocate that respect by not taking some\nposition in the future that might place us at odds with each other.”\nAnden’s pulse was racing and he shifted uneasily in his seat, his neck hot.\nAyt was making the proposal as clear as if she were sitting here speaking\ndirectly to another Pillar. “Ayt-jen.” He cleared his throat. The near certainty\nthat he would be returned in one piece to deliver Ayt’s pronouncements to No\nPeak gave him the courage to speak up with more force than he had before.\n“May I … ask a candid question?”\nAyt raised her eyebrows. “Please do.”\n“I’m only a student, so forgive me if I don’t understand, but … why go to\nthe trouble and risk of bringing me here and involving me in this\nconversation? If you want to propose an alliance with No Peak, why don’t\nyou do so directly?”\nAyt smiled a satisfied, enigmatic smile that held no real warmth. “You sell\nyourself short. My offer to you personally, is quite real. You have an\nimportant future role to play in ensuring peace between our clans, if your\nPillar recognizes so. As for conversing with the Kauls …” She opened her\nhands in a gesture of helpless disappointment. “I would welcome a discussion\nwith Kaul Lan, but how is that possible when his Horn keeps giving offense\nagainst us? He never passes up an opportunity to harass us over territorial\nlines. His Fingers spy on us; his Fists pick battles over minor disputes. How\nare we supposed to expect a reasonable dialogue with No Peak?” For the first\ntime during the entire conversation, Ayt Mada glanced at her Horn. She and\nGont shared a brief, silent exchange before she turned back to Anden. “If the\nPillar gave us some sign that he was serious about peace, then that would be a\ndifferent matter.”\nAyt stood up, smoothly and casually. Gont rose as well, and Anden\nfollowed suit at once. Ayt was taller than he’d expected. Anden was taller\nthan most Kekonese, and her eyes were on a level with his. The sunlight\nstruck the coils of jade on her arms and lit the steel settings with motes of\nlight. “We’ve taken enough of your time this afternoon; let’s get you home"

You know what\nto do next. I’ll wait for an answer, but not for long.”\nAnden clasped his hands and touched them to his forehead. “Ayt-jen.”\nCHAPTER\n11\nWhere the Pillar Stands\nT\nhe ZT Valor pulled over to the side of the curving boulevard and let Anden\nout in front of the wide green space next to the handicraft market plaza in the\nTemple District. As soon as Anden stepped out of the car, he saw his cousin\nHilo waiting for him, a posse of men behind him. Hilo’s face was flushed\nwith relief and murderous intent, and for one ridiculous second, Anden was\nafraid for Gont’s driver. He shut the back door of the vehicle quickly and the\nZT Valor took off at once, losing itself in traffic as it sped back across\nterritorial lines.\nHilo strode up, seized Anden by the back of the neck, and shook him\nroughly. “I ought to give you another beating. What the fuck were you doing\nin Summer Park? You’re going to be green in less than a year; you have to\npay attention every fucking second because I can’t always be there if there’s\ntrouble, understand?” Anden nodded, shamefaced. Hilo grasped the younger\nman’s chin in his hand, eyes narrowing dangerously at the swollen bruise on\nAnden’s cheek that the trio of Wie Lon boys had given him as a souvenir of\nhis careless wandering. “They do this to you?” he asked. “Gont or his men\nknock you around at all?”\n“No, no, it wasn’t them,” Anden said hastily. “That was just a stupid thing\nthat happened with some Wie Lon guys earlier. Gont’s people didn’t touch\nme.”\nHilo searched the teenager’s face for sincerity, then, finally relaxing,\nembraced Anden with a warmth that melted the last of the tension. “Am I\never glad to see you, cousin.” With one hand resting protectively between\nAnden’s shoulder blades, he walked them over to the Duchesse, which was\nparked quite prominently in the plaza’s loading zone along with two other No\nPeak vehicles. Maik Tar was leaning restlessly against the trunk, but\nstraightened up to open the car door for them. “I need to talk to Lan,” Anden\nsaid a bit weakly as they got in. Now that he was safe, the low level of\nadrenaline that had been flowing through him for the past few hours was\ndraining out like gutter runoff after a heavy rain, leaving him shaky.\n“Lan’s in the Weather Man’s office,” Hilo said.\nIt took only ten minutes to get to Ship Street. When they arrived, Hilo\ngave some brief instructions to his men: “Go tell the guys in Little Hammer\nto clear off.” Then he and Tar walked with Anden straight through the lobby\nwithout bothering to check in at the reception desk.\nAnden had never been in the Weather Man’s building before.

This was a\nside of the clan he knew little about, and he was intimidated by all the\nLuckbringers in pressed suits, carrying briefcases and file folders. Hilo and\nTar, with their sleeves and collars loose and sweaty from waiting in the sun,\nmoon blades still slung over their shoulders and talon knives sheathed at their\nwaists, seemed out of place here. People paused and looked over as they\npassed, some saluting shallowly.\nThey took the elevator up to the top floor. Lan was waiting for them, his\nexpression no less calm than Anden was accustomed to, but he too embraced\nAnden joyfully. “Come in here and sit down,” he said, leading Anden to his\nown office.\n“They brought me to meet with Ayt Mada,” Anden said. “Lan-jen … she\nwanted me to talk to you right away.” He placed slightly heavier emphasis on\nyou.\nLan understood. When they got to his office, the Pillar turned to Hilo and\nsaid, “I want to talk to Anden alone first. Find Doru and wait out here for\nme.” Hilo looked piqued but not surprised, and quirking his mouth at Anden\nto show that he was not really sour about it, he jerked his head at Tar and the\ntwo of them moved off as Lan shut his office door.\nAnden sat down in the nearest chair, gratefully accepting the bottle of\nlemon soda water that the Pillar took from the mini-fridge and handed to him.\n“I won’t lie; you had us all a little worried today,” Lan said. Watching Anden\ngulp the soda, he said, “Take your time. Then tell me what the Mountain\nwants.”\nWhen his cousin was done, Lan was quiet at first. Then he said, “You did\nwell, Anden. You kept your cool and did exactly what you were supposed to.\nI’m sorry it ruined your Boat Day, and you ought to be more careful in the\nfuture. I’m sure Hilo’s already told you that. But you ended up doing a brave\nthing for the clan.”\n“I’m sorry to have caused trouble, Lan-jen.”\nLan smiled. The boy—the young man, Lan reminded himself—was\nalways like this: a little anxious, a bit overly formal. When he was in the Kaul\nhome, he still acted like a guest, waiting for subtle permission to sit or eat or\nvoice opinions, even though he’d lived in the house since he was a child and\nresided there still during the Academy’s holiday breaks. “You’re never any\ntrouble, Anden,” Lan told him. “I think the Mountain has been planning to\ngive us a shake like this. You just happened to give Gont a way to do it.” He\nstood up, and Anden stood with him.\n“What are you going to do?” Anden asked. “About Ayt’s proposal?”\n“I’ll discuss it with the Horn and the Weather Man,” Lan said. “That’s not\nsomething you need to worry about. You just focus on school and preparing\nfor Trials this year. Are you still on track to graduate Rank One?”"

I’ll try my best,” Anden promised, and Lan felt a surge of\npride. Anden was a good kid; he’d come from a tragic family situation, but\nhe’d grown up well. Not a day went by that Lan didn’t feel thankful he’d\nconvinced his grandfather to take Anden in and make him a Kaul.\nLan took his cousin out to the chairs in the elevator lobby where Doru,\nHilo, and Maik Tar were waiting. Tar took Anden back to the Academy while\nLan returned to his office with the Horn and the Weather Man. He poured all\nthree of them a generous splash of hoji over ice and said, “Take these; we’re\ngoing to need them.” He swallowed his own drink and regarded the two other\nmen: Doru sitting in one of the chairs with his long legs crossed, patient\ncuriosity on his face; Hilo leaning against the wall, his gaze sharp and\nexpectant. Their jade auras hummed steadily in Lan’s awareness: cool and\nmurky on one side, smooth and hot on the other.\nLan said, “The Mountain has a plan to produce and sell SN1 in Ygutan. It\ncould make them a lot of money, and Ayt proposes we join in with them on\nit.”\nAfter Lan had explained what he’d learned from Anden, Hilo straightened\nup from the wall. “What does Ayt take us for?” His expression was angry,\nbut his voice was more perplexed than anything else. “The Mountain’s been\ndigging at us for months, and today Gont grabs Andy off the street. Just about\nstarts the war right there. And they think we’re going to get into bed with\nthem after that? If Ayt really wanted to talk business, she would’ve come to\nyou properly, with respect. This proposal isn’t serious. It’s an insult.”\nHilo was right; the Mountain sending a message to No Peak in such a\nvaguely threatening way was a blatant slight, but at least Lan knew from\nAnden what Ayt’s purported reason was. I would welcome a discussion with\nKaul Lan, but how is that possible, when his Horn keeps giving offense\nagainst us? The other Pillar was letting it be known that she would not deign\nto negotiate directly with Kaul Lan until he reined in or removed his brother\nfrom his position as Horn.\nIt was an outrageous demand. Was it even possible to attempt any\ndiscussion under such flagrantly disrespectful terms as one Pillar stipulating\nthe other’s choice of his Horn? Lan had no doubt Hilo and his men made life\ndifficult for the Mountain, but his brother maintained that it was all in\nresponse to the Mountain’s escalating overreach. Was Hilo truly the\naggressor standing in the way of peace, or was he simply too good at his job,\nsomeone Ayt wanted out of the way so she could more easily dominate No\nPeak, or even seize it outright?\nCeding the clan’s military position was out of the question, but perhaps\nthe Horn did need to be reminded that he was not blameless for bad relations\nbetween the clans.

Lan kept his eyes on his brother and said, “Ayt says she’ll\ntalk in person if we put an end to street skirmishing and show we’re\ninterested in getting in on the business side.” He caught a glimpse of Doru\nnodding and suspected the old advisor had inferred the more specific demand\nprecisely.\n“So she’ll talk if we lie down and let the Mountain walk over us?” Hilo’s\nnostrils flared. “I know you think I’m touchy about things sometimes, that I\nget angry and take things personal, but trust me Lan, I know what’s going on\nout there. Gont looks like a meathead, but he’s crafty. Every time I’m not\nlooking, he takes a bit more from us. Little by little but never enough to\nprovoke an outright war. I’ll find out two of our Lantern Men are now paying\ntribute to his Fists. Or that somehow the lease on a building that housed our\nbusinesses went sour, and the landlord sold it to a cousin in the Mountain.\nThey can’t swallow us whole like they did the Three Run clan, so they’re\npicking and picking at us instead.”\nLan turned to his Weather Man. “What do you think, Doru?”\nDoru took his time responding. A little too much time, Lan thought, as if\nhe was deliberately trying not to come off as being too ready with an answer.\n“I think Ayt-jen’s proposal has merit. The Fists of both clans can only see as\nfar as they can swing their blades; whatever petty disagreements they have\nover territory are not terribly important in the larger scheme of things and\nshouldn’t influence our decision when it comes to big business.” A criticism\nof the Horn’s side of the clan, discernible in his gravelly voice. “Ayt-jen is\nright about how the foreigners all want SN1, how there’s a great deal of\nmoney to be made in establishing a reliable supply that we Green Bones\ncontrol. Since the operations would be offshore in Ygutan, there’s no danger\nof it polluting our own country. Green Bones have always been strongest\nwhen united; instead of trying to divide Kekon between us, we could strike\nan alliance with the Mountain to increase the gain for us all.”\nHilo’s lips were drawn back. “There’s no such thing as an alliance with\nthe Mountain. Three Run found that out the hard way. At the end, we’ll be\ntwo clans with two Pillars, or one clan with one Pillar.” Hilo tipped back an\nice cube from his glass and crunched it, his face set in a sure scowl. “If we\nshow interest in this, if we agree to work with them, they’ll only use the\nopportunity to control us. I don’t believe for a second that Ayt is serious\nabout sharing power. She’s not the type. She hasn’t even made it clear what\nshe wants from us. Financing? Manpower?”\n“For a start, it seems she wants our assurance that if nothing else, we\nwon’t stand against them,” Doru said. “It makes perfect sense; why else make\na play for Anden? When the boy graduates, we can send him to work for the\nMountain in their new Ygutanian operations. It’s a good job, like Ayt-jen"

Through him, we would know everything about\nthe Mountain’s operations there, and for their part, they would be certain we\nwere invested in keeping the peace, not undermining them or going to the\nEspenians. So there’d be trust on both sides.”\n“Send Andy over to the enemy?” Hilo’s eyes bulged with disbelief; his\naura was becoming uncomfortable to Perceive.\nDoru said, “During the Three Crowns era, royal houses often exchanged\nchildren so both sides were motivated to maintain good relations.”\n“You mean offer Andy as a hostage.” Hilo spun toward Lan with a snarl.\n“Never. Not a fucking chance!”\nDoru sniffed. “Sometimes, the old ways are not without wisdom.”\nLan held up a hand to forestall Doru saying anything more, and looking\ninto Hilo’s flushed face, he said quietly, “Calm down. Anden’s not a pawn,\nand we’re not sending him anywhere he doesn’t want to go.” Lan had been\nswirling the melting ice cubes in his glass as he listened and pondered, and\nnow he set his glass down on the table, having come to an inescapable\nconclusion about what his response to the Mountain had to be. Hilo had a\ntendency to react personally, while Doru evaluated options with cold-\nblooded, strategic pragmatism, but there was a third angle that neither of\nthem had voiced, that was, for Lan, the deciding factor.\nLan turned to Doru. “I’m going to prepare a reply to the Mountain, and I\nwant you to send it through their Weather Man’s office, the way it ought to\nbe done in business matters like this. We don’t have to act improperly just\nbecause they do. I’m going to decline any alliance or partnership with the\nMountain when it comes to the production of shine. However, we won’t\nstand in their way either. They’re free to pursue their venture, so long as it\ndoesn’t threaten any of No Peak’s businesses or territories.” He paused, then\nadded, “Make no mention of Anden; he’s not part of this. If Ayt wants\nassurance of our neutrality, she’ll have to take our word for it.”\nDoru inclined his head, but it was easy to see from both his tight\nexpression and the prickly change in his aura the disappointment he felt in the\nmatter. “If I might ask, what is your rationale for deciding on this important\nmatter so quickly?”\nLan didn’t really want to hear whatever counterarguments he knew Doru\nwas sure to provide but he owed his highest advisors an explanation. “It takes\nus down a dangerous path. If more foreigners have access to shine, demand\nfor jade will rise as well. There’ll be pressure on the Kekon Jade Alliance to\nincrease mining and to reform export quotas to sell not just to the Espenians,\nbut to the Ygutanians and others as well, or risk the black market filling that\ndemand with smuggled jade.”\nLan could not condone that; he had just voted against an increase in jade\nexports at the last KJA meeting.

        "text": "demand with smuggled jade.”\nLan could not condone that; he had just voted against an increase in jade\nexports at the last KJA meeting. Jade was Kekon’s most precious natural\nresource. It was the birthright of the Kekonese people and lay at the center of\nthe Green Bone culture and way of life. Selling it as a militarily useful\nsubstance to foreigners, to people who had no jade warrior training or\nupbringing, who did not understand aisho and could not appreciate what it\nmeant to be green … it sat uneasily with him. Yes, the export of jade\nmaintained the alliance with the Espenians and enriched the national coffers,\nbut it had to be strictly limited. That was why the Green Bone clans held\nauthority over the Kekon Jade Alliance in the first place. Now one of the\nmajor clans was proposing something that was sure to undermine the power\nof the KJA in the long run, and that disturbed him greatly.\n“Forgive me, Lan-se,” Doru argued with more forcefulness than usual,\n“but surely the KJA is an example that our two clans are capable of existing\nin partnership. Any future mining and export decisions will have to be made\njointly between us and the Mountain. It seems premature to worry about them\nnow.”\nLan glanced at the Weather Man in mild surprise. He would not\npersonally have held up the Kekon Jade Alliance as a shining example of clan\npartnership. The tiers of accountability and stakeholder voting requirements\nseemed to ensure that no KJA decisions were ever made in less than six\nmonths. “You obviously have a more optimistic view of the KJA than I do,”\nLan replied. “But there are other reasons not to get involved.”\n“Such as the fact that Ayt’s whole proposal is a setup,” Hilo insisted. “A\nway for the Mountain to appear reasonable while gaining an advantage over\nus.”\nLan was inclined to agree with Hilo’s suspicions but did not voice this out\nloud. “Shine is a poison,” he said firmly. “It erodes the natural order of\nsociety. It encourages people who shouldn’t have anything to do with jade.\nLike those boys, the thieves that Hilo caught at the Twice Lucky last month.”\nLan set his jaw. “If we get involved in producing shine in any way, we’ll be\ncontributing to the trafficking and unsanctioned use of jade. I won’t judge\nanother Pillar’s opinions, but to my thinking, doing this would be a violation\nof aisho.”\n“Is it not the highest level of aisho that Green Bones protect the country?”\nDoru asked. “Working together to control SN1 will make the clans stronger.\nThat will make Kekon stronger, less vulnerable to foreigners.”\n“And what if the Espenians find out that Green Bone clans are selling\ndrugs to the Ygutanians for military use? Ygutan will blame the SN1\nfactories on Kekon and deny any official involvement. The Mountain is\ncourting conflict, and I don’t want No Peak involved.” Lan cut off Doru’s\nattempt to say anything further. “Doru-jen, my decision on this is final. Are\nyou going to fulfill your responsibilities as Weather Man and handle this the\nway I’ve asked?”\nThe old advisor’s tapered chin dipped in unenthusiastic acknowledgment."

Now that the hard talk was\nover, Lan spoke in a more conciliatory tone. “I think our nerves are a little\nfrayed. You should know, both of you, that I value your opinions.”\n“So now what?” Hilo asked. “We wait to see how Ayt responds?”\n“Not quite. I said we won’t interfere with the Mountain, but knowing\nwhat they’re up to, we need to be more careful. Doru, I want you to set up a\nmeeting for me with Chancellor Son.” Having been so strongly put in his\nplace a minute earlier, the Weather Man nodded without complaint.\nLan turned to his brother. “Hilo, what I told you about the Armpit now\napplies to Sogen and all our border territories as well. Bolster defenses where\nyou have to, but no bloodshed without family approval. No retaliation for\nthem taking Anden either. Maybe they spat in our eye, but he’s back with no\nharm done, and we’re denying them the alliance they want, so best not to\ncreate more hard feelings for a while.”\nHilo crossed his arms and shrugged. “If you say so.”\n“One other thing,” Lan said. “I want to make sure Shae is protected. Her\napartment is in North Sotto, so there shouldn’t be any trouble, but I’m talking\nabout when she’s going around in Janloon. Have one or two of your people\nkeep an eye on her.”\nNow Hilo looked displeased; he made a face that Lan thought was\nchildish, as if he were eight years old and being upbraided to be nice to his\nsister. “Shae’s plenty able to look after herself.”\nLan said, exasperated, “You know she’s not wearing jade. She’s not part\nof the clan business, but maybe the Mountain doesn’t know that. After what\nhappened to Anden today, we should take precautions.”\n“If she wore her jade, she’d be plenty able to look after herself,” Hilo\namended, clearly still grumpy about it, but not disagreeing. Lan let it go. He\nwas glad to have Shae back, with or without her jade, but saying so would\nonly make Hilo sulk. Lan had concluded long ago that there was little he\ncould say or do if his younger siblings were determined to be cruel to each\nother.\nCHAPTER\n12\nA Man Named Mudt\nB"

Lan had concluded long ago that there was little he\ncould say or do if his younger siblings were determined to be cruel to each\nother.\nCHAPTER\n12\nA Man Named Mudt\nB\nero’s face healed crooked, and when he looked in the mirror, he mused\nthat he was ugly now. Also, he limped a little when he ran. These things did\nnot matter so much to him, but when he noticed them, which was often, he\nremembered the disaster of the night at the Twice Lucky. He remembered the\nMaik brothers’ heavy fists, the Horn’s casual disdain, and the Pillar’s look of\nundisguised pity, as if Bero were a three-legged dog, not even worth killing.\nBut most of all, Bero remembered jade. What it had been like to have it,\nand what it had been like to lose it.\nSampa, that Abukei pussy, had gone straight as a rod. With the fear of\nanything green beaten into him, he’d taken a job as a bike courier. Bero saw\nhim huffing and puffing down the streets of their poor dockworkers\nneighborhood at the edge of the Forge, his doughy body straining on the\npedals as he hauled boxes and bundles on a squeaking, rusted bike trailer.\nWhen Bero called out to him, Sampa ignored him. In retaliation, Bero slashed\nSampa’s tires and the boy missed his deliveries one day and lost his job.\nBero’s aunt worked twelve hours a day as a seamstress in a garment\nfactory, and Bero slept on the floor of her apartment when she was not there.\nThe aunt’s boyfriend worked in a warehouse at the docks and knew how to\nskim a little for himself. Not enough to get caught and fired but enough to\nsustain his drinking habit. Though the bastard never did Bero any favors, it\nwas through him that Bero caught wind of a man named Mudt, who fenced\nstolen merchandise out of the back of a discount goods store in Junko.\nThat in itself was not so interesting to Bero, but the other rumors he heard\nwere. He found the man in the back room of his store, counting boxes. Mudt\nwas a tawny-looking man with crinkly hair and small eyes; he might have\nhad a bit of Abukei blood in him. “What do you want?” asked Mudt.\nBero said, “I heard you’ve got work, for people who want it.”\n“Maybe.” The man coughed into his elbow and turned toward Bero with\nwatery, pinprick bright eyes. Even in the muggy heat, he wore a gray shirt\nwith sleeves down to his wrists; the armpits and collar were dark with sweat.\n“It’s not work for pussies, though. Can you drive? Can you handle a gun?”\n“I can do both.” Bero studied the man. “Is it true? That you’re green?”\nMudt smirked. Then he stuck out his tongue, showing off the jade stud\npierced through the center of it. “Oh, it’s real,” he assured Bero. “I don’t\nmind telling you because I know you’re cut, keke. You’re hungry.” He\ntapped the center of his own forehead with an index finger and grinned with\ncrooked teeth. “Perception, you see.”"

You’re hungry.” He\ntapped the center of his own forehead with an index finger and grinned with\ncrooked teeth. “Perception, you see.”\nIf it was true that Mudt had jade, then the rest of what Bero had heard was\nprobably true as well: that Mudt had false papers and a reliable source of\nshine, that as a small business owner in No Peak territory, he paid nominal\ntribute to the clan, but made his real wealth as an informer for the Mountain.\nMudt was a self-made man. Proof that you didn’t need to be born into the\nright family or go to the right school to have what the Green Bones had, to\ntake power when it wasn’t given to you.\n“I want to work for you,” said Bero.\nCHAPTER\n13\nA Favor Asked\nS\nhae was beginning to quite like her new home in North Sotto. Tackling the\ntasks of settling into an apartment made her feel productive and, even if she\nwasn’t sure what she was going to do next as far as work was concerned, it\ngave her confidence that she could do this—she could live in Janloon and be\nnear her family but still maintain her independence. She purchased attractive\nbut basic furniture, stocked the apartment with necessities, and got used to\ncooking for one person again. She began exploring the neighborhood around\nher building and was pleased to find it contained an assortment of shops\nselling everything from brand-name handbags to malodorous herbal powders,\nand a range of eateries from oyster bars to nighttime noodle stands. More\nupscale than the crowded, unkempt Sotto Village, North Sotto was a\ngentrifying, trendy district populated by young professionals, artists, and a\ndecent smattering of foreign expats. Shae could wear bold prints and bright\nskirts from her Espenian wardrobe, and far from looking out of place, appear\ntrendsetting and stylish. This was Janloon at its most cosmopolitan and\nworldly.\nHowever, even though an innocent visitor to the city might not notice it, it\nwas apparent to Shae that the clan ruled here as strongly as it did anywhere\nelse. She saw white lanterns—real ones or cheap paper cutouts—hanging in\nwindows wherever she went. More than once she passed one or two,\noccasionally three, of Hilo’s people. Without her jade, she could not Perceive\ntheir auras, but they were easy to spot: tough, hard-bodied young men and\nsometimes women, well dressed, casually armed with knives or blades, jade\nalmost always on prominent display. Most people hurried past them, not\nwanting to draw any undue attention. Shae did the same, though for different\nreasons.\nHer neighbors consisted of a twentysomething couple who looked as if\nthey worked in the Financial District (the woman owned a tiny dog with the\nsize and charm of an overfed rat), a single middle-aged woman who was\nalways having her other single middle-aged woman friends over to drink\nwine and play loud card games, and a college-age young man who moved\ninto the apartment down the hall from Shae’s about two weeks after she\narrived. He seemed to come and go frequently, and after they’d nodded to\neach other several times when passing in the hallways or on the stairs, Shae"

He seemed to come and go frequently, and after they’d nodded to\neach other several times when passing in the hallways or on the stairs, Shae\nthought she ought to introduce herself. She was hesitant to do so. Once she\nsaid the name Kaul, her pleasant anonymity here would end.\nShe told herself it was ridiculous to let such a thing prevent her from ever\nmeeting anyone new. When she next saw her neighbor, they happened to be\nleaving the building at the same time. “I keep seeing you, but I don’t know\nyour name,” she said to him, smiling.\n“Ah,” he said, looking slightly abashed. He tipped his shoulders forward\nand touched his forehead in informal greeting. “I’m Caun Yudenru.”\nShae returned the gesture. “I’m Shae.”\nCaun Yu raised his eyebrows. Heat rushed into Shae’s cheeks. She’d\nmeant to give her full name, but somehow only the diminutive personal had\nescaped her mouth. Gods. He must be thinking her a shameless flirt. Caun\nwas attractive—though he was younger than she and always wore the same\nblack skullcap hat that made him look like a delinquent—but that wasn’t the\npoint. She wasn’t interested in a rebound relationship. “It’s nice to meet you,\nMr. Caun.” Shae backpedaled into formality, secretly cringing at what an odd\nmess she was making out of a simple encounter. “I will … see you soon,\nthen.”\nSomehow, she kept her poise, smiled benignly, and strode down the street\nwithout hurrying, as if she’d meant to make a fool of herself all along.\nDetermined to start making some headway on finding employment, she\nwent to the city library and perused business directories of Janloon, jotting\ndown the names and addresses of companies that interested her into a coil-\nbound notebook. After a couple of hours of this, she was struck again, as she\nhad been with the apartment hunt, by how needlessly slow and ineffective the\nprocess was. No Peak controlled businesses in many sectors, some through\ndirect ownership but far more through patronage relationships with tribute-\npaying Lantern Men. A few well-placed phone calls and she could bypass all\nthis legwork. She wondered if adhering to her policy of no help from the\nfamily was truly a worthy principle, or if she was just being prideful to the\npoint of idiocy.\nShe knew what Hilo’s opinion on that would be. Stubbornly, she persisted\nfor another half an hour before closing the books and leaving the library, still\nnot sure if she’d wasted her time or spent it well. On the way home, she\nbought a typewriter to update her resume. She’d been back in her apartment\nnot more than twenty minutes when there was a knock on her door.\nShe opened it to find Lan standing in the hallway. “May I come in?” he\nasked pleasantly.\nShe was so nonplussed that she didn’t say anything, merely held the door\nopen for him to enter. He stepped into her apartment, leaving his two\nbodyguards waiting outside, and closed the door behind him. For a moment,\nhe glanced curiously around the main room.

How meager this place must appear to him, how cheap and\nunworthy a residence for a member of the Kaul family. She crossed her arms\nand sat down on her stiff new sofa, feeling defensive even though he hadn’t\nyet said a word. If Hilo were here instead of Lan, he would be walking\naround, touching things. “It’s nice,” Hilo would say, shrugging and smiling\nlike someone amused by a child who has thrown a fit and was now insisting\non sleeping outside. “You like this place, Shae? So long as you like it, I\nguess.”\nLan said, “Do you have anything to drink? It’s still hot outside.” He\nstarted toward the small kitchen, but Shae jumped up and said, “I’m sorry, let\nme get it. I should’ve offered, but you … surprised me.” She hurried past him\ninto the kitchen, which really only fit one person comfortably anyway, and\ntook a pitcher of chilled spiced tea from the fridge. She poured him a full\nglass, hastily arranged some sesame crackers and roasted nuts onto a plate,\nand brought them back out to the front room.\nLan took the glass from her with a smile that seemed almost apologetic, as\nif he had not meant to put her to any trouble, then motioned her back to the\nsofa and sat down next to her, shifting on the overly firm new cushions.\n“Is … everything all right?” Shae asked. She could not understand why\nLan would come to her instead of summoning her to the Kaul house.\nLan said sternly, “Do I need an excuse to come see my little sister?”\nWhen she froze at the apparent rebuke, he winked at her to show he was\nteasing, and the gesture was both so much like Lan at his most relaxed, and\nalso so at odds with the earnest air of command he possessed as Pillar that\nShae laughed.\nLan drained half his glass, then turned to her with a more serious\nexpression. “I am here for a reason, Shae.” He chose his words before\nspeaking. “I’ve been having doubts about whether Doru is telling me\neverything I need to know. You can’t find a more seasoned Weather Man,\nand you know how close he is to Grandda. But there are things he’s said,\nsmall things, that make me think that I can’t count on him completely.”\nShae made a face; she despised Doru. “You should replace him.”\nHe turned his characteristically straight gaze on her. “I respect your\ndecision not to be a part of the clan business. I don’t like the idea of you\nwalking around the city without jade, but I’m not going to stop you either.\nWhatever it is you decide to do, I’ll support you. I’ve told you that before,\nand it hasn’t changed.”\n“But,” Shae added. Her shoulders sagged. It was only a matter of time …\n“I need someone I trust, someone who knows the business, to go up to the\nmines and take a look around. Go through their books, check to see that\neverything’s in order, and make sure it matches official KJA records. As a\nfavor to me.”\nShae didn’t answer right away.

        "text": "everything’s in order, and make sure it matches official KJA records. As a\nfavor to me.”\nShae didn’t answer right away. Now she understood why he’d come to her\napartment on the pretense of a visit instead of having this conversation in the\nhouse where Doru might notice and wonder. “Is that all?” she asked.\nHe furrowed his brow, as if suspecting sarcasm. “It’s weeks of work.”\n“I know, but this is all you’re asking for, nothing else after that?”\n“No,” he said. “This is all. I won’t pull you into the clan business by\nstealthy degrees, Shae, if that’s what you’re suspecting of me.” There was a\nslight harshness in his voice that made Shae drop her eyes in guilt. By\nsuspecting Lan’s intentions, she’d affronted his pride after he’d already\nstooped to coming here and asking his younger sister for help.\nYears ago, her involvement with the Espenians had begun with a few\nsmall, simple requests, that had led to slightly larger requests, that had led to\na file folder with her name on it and nearly ruined her relationship with her\ngrandfather. Shae had not forgotten that a single step in one direction might\nportend an irrevocable change in one’s path.\nBut this was her brother asking, not Jerald or any of his smiling superiors.\nAs Pillar, Lan could demand her allegiance; he could ask her to kneel and\nreaffirm her oaths, and could cut her out of the family if she refused. He had\nnot done that. She did not think he would consider it even if she said no to his\nrequest. She’d always taken Lan for granted, and she was reminded of that\nnow.\nA sudden trip south into the interior of the island would delay her\nadmittedly vague job-hunting plans, but it wasn’t as if she was under any\ndeadline. “I’ll go, Lan,” she said. “As a favor to you.”\nCHAPTER\n14\nGold and Jade\nA\ns the Pillar, Lan had a handful of personal staff headed by his longtime\nAcademy friend, Woon Papidonwa, who were part of neither the military nor\nbusiness halves of No Peak, and did not answer to either the Horn or the\nWeather Man. They managed Lan’s schedule in addition to administrative\nand household tasks such as the maintenance and security of the Kaul estate\nand other clan properties, including the beach house in Marenia. Although\nthey held little formal authority in the clan, these individuals were not to be\ndisregarded; the lead Pillarman was often a confidant of the Pillar and\noftentimes went on to hold more influential positions.\nHis grandfather’s stubborn lack of cooperation notwithstanding, Lan was\nmore intent than ever to transition Yun Doru into retirement and appoint his\nown Weather Man within the year. Given recent events and the tension\nbetween the clans, however, it would be unwise to lose the current Weather\nMan until Lan had a new one that he had complete confidence in, ready to\ntake over. Woon was secretly one of his leading candidates to replace Doru,\nbut Lan had doubts as to whether his ever-stalwart aide was clever enough to\nstep into such an important role in the clan. He resolved to include Woon in\nmore substantive tasks over the next few months to see how he handled them."

        "text": "step into such an important role in the clan. He resolved to include Woon in\nmore substantive tasks over the next few months to see how he handled them.\nIn the meantime, perhaps Kaul Sen would soften his stance.\nSo he took Woon along with him to Wisdom Hall to meet with Chancellor\nSon. A wide and imposing structure of dark brick and red tile, Wisdom Hall\nhoused the legislative chambers of the Royal Council of Kekon, the official\ngoverning body of the nation. It sat a stone’s throw away from the Triumphal\nPalace, where Prince Ioan III and his family lived in state-funded ceremonial\nleisure. Both buildings were in the Monument District, which, despite being\nless than fifteen minutes away from the Kaul estate, was the most clan-\nneutral territory in Janloon aside from the Temple District. The driver pulled\nLan’s silver Roewolfe roadster right up to the long reflecting pool in front of\nthe imposing tiers of marble steps. Lan and his Pillarman got out and crossed\nthe stone pathway that bisected the still, glass-like water, both of them\nstopping, as was tradition when one reached the end of the walk, to salute the\nWarrior’s Memorial.\nThe Warrior’s Memorial was a pair of large bronze statues. The smaller\none was of a boy holding up a lantern, presumably illuminating the face of\nthe other statue, a nameless Green Bone warrior who knelt in front of the\nchild. It looked as if the man had come across the child alone and was\nkneeling down to bring him to safety. Or it might have been that the child had\ncome across the warrior, bereft in the darkness, and was holding out the\nlantern to light his way. Either interpretation would be suitably nationalistic.\nThe inscription on the base of the monument read:\nOUT OF DARKNESS\nIN MEMORY OF THE MOUNTAIN MEN WHO FOUGHT\nFOR KEKON’S FREEDOM\nAND THE BRAVE CITIZENS WHO AIDED THEM\nLan tried to picture his irascible old grandfather as the young warrior\ncaptured in bronze, one of the patriotic freedom fighters who opposed fifty\nyears of Shotarian rule and eventually forced a powerful empire, weakened\nby the Many Nations War but still possessing far superior numbers and\nweaponry, to relinquish Kekon to its people. It struck Lan as remarkable that\nit had been only a generation ago that Green Bones were persecuted as\nbandits and criminals, secretly abetted by a populace that celebrated their\nsuperhuman exploits. Now here he was, walking into Wisdom Hall to meet\nwith the highest-ranking politician in the country. In some ways, Lan\nthought, it must have been simpler—dangerous but more heroic—to be a\nGreen Bone back in his grandfather’s days, when the enemy had been a cruel\nforeign power.\nThe statue of the kneeling fighter was depicted with a moon blade carried\nat his waist, and the armbands he wore had settings for many small gems.\nWalking past the memorial, Lan noticed that the settings were empty; vandals\nhad stolen the memorialized warrior’s jade, even though they were nothing\nmore than inert decorative green rocks.\nThe foyer of Wisdom Hall was a splendidly wide space with pale marble\ntiling and thick green columns stretching up to the elaborately painted\nceiling. Lan and Woon were met by a young aide, who saluted them\nrespectfully and escorted them to the chancellor’s office. “Son is bound to"

Lan and Woon were met by a young aide, who saluted them\nrespectfully and escorted them to the chancellor’s office. “Son is bound to\nask for something,” Lan said to Woon in a quiet aside as they walked. “Think\non what that might be and what we ought to grant him.”\nThey were shown through a set of double wooden doors. As they entered,\nthe chancellor came around his massive desk to salute and greet them. Son\nTomarho was a powerfully built man of about fifty with a dimpled chin and\nbushy eyebrows. He must have been a physically formidable man in his\nyouth, but years of good living in middle age had melted the cords of muscle\ninto rolls of fat. The chancellor beamed a broad politician’s smile at Lan.\n“Kaul-jen, come in, come in. How are the gods favoring you?”\n“Well enough, Chancellor,” Lan replied, exchanging a few minutes of\npleasantry before settling himself into the seat in front of Son’s desk. Woon\npositioned the other chair properly behind and to the left of Lan’s before\nseating himself.\nThe chancellor sank into his high-backed leather chair, which gave a\nprotesting sigh. Lacing his hands over the curve of his generous paunch, he\nregarded Lan with nodding attentiveness. “What troubles the Pillar of the clan\nthat I can help with?”\nLan gathered his thoughts. “Chancellor Son, I’m afraid I’m paying you\nthis visit out of a sense of great concern.”\nUnlike his siblings, Lan remembered his father. In the last year of the Many\nNations War, some months before Kaul Dushuron fell in one of the final\nbattles against the beleaguered Shotarian army, Lan asked his father, “Who\nwill be in charge of Kekon when the Shotties are gone? Will it be you?”\n“No,” said Kaul Du indulgently. “It won’t be me.”\n“Will it be Grandda? Or Ayt-jen?”\n“It won’t be any of us. We’re Green Bones.” His father was copying a list\nof names, a train schedule, and a map onto three separate sets of paper and\nsealing them in unmarked envelopes. “Gold and jade, never together.”\n“Why do people say that?” Lan had often heard the phrase in casual\nconversation. “Gold and jade” was a Kekonese idiom that referred to greed\nand excess. An inappropriate level of overreach. A person hoping for too\nmuch good fortune might be warned, “Don’t ask for gold and jade.” A child\nwho demanded a custard tart after already having had a sweet bun was, Lan\nknew from personal experience, likely to be scolded, “You want gold and\njade together!”\nLan’s father glanced up at him with a squint. For a moment, Lan was\nafraid that his persistent questions had annoyed his father and he would be\nsent out of the room so the man could finish his task in peace. Kaul Du was\nnot a regular presence in the house; he and Lan’s grandfather were gone for\nlong periods of time on secretive missions, and when they were back, Lan’s\ngrandmother and mother treated the occasion like a personal visit from the\ngods—a great honor, an unnatural disruption, something to be celebrated but"

Kaul Du kissed his children but did not know\nhow to relate to them. He spoke to Lan as he would an adult. In the other\nroom, Lan’s infant brother Hilo wailed as their mother tried to comfort him.\n“A long time ago, many hundreds of years before the Shotarians came,\nthere were three kingdoms on Kekon.” Kaul Du spoke while directing half of\nhis attention back to his lists and maps. “The kingdom of Jan along the\nnorthern coast where we are now, Hunto in the central basin, and Tiedo on\nthe southern peninsula. Hunto was the strongest, but the Hunto king was thin-\nblooded and obsessed with jade. One night, he went horribly insane from the\nItches and swept through the palace murdering his family, including his own\nchildren.”\nLan’s eyes shifted to the ample jade his father wore around his neck and\nwrists. Noticing this, Kaul Du grinned and snatched Lan by the arm, pulling\nhim close with rough affection. “Does that worry you, son?” Kaul Du yanked\nhis talon knife from the sheath on his belt and held it up between them. Lan\ncould see how fine the edge was, how the hilt was weathered to his father’s\nhand. “Are you worried about your da? What might happen to him?” Kaul\nDu asked.\n“No,” Lan said, his voice calm. At the age of eight, he knew that all the\nmen of his family were Green Bones, and this meant they wore jade and\nswore oaths to a secret clan that fought against the injustice of the foreigners.\n“Good,” said his father, his arm still tight around Lan’s shoulders. “You\nneedn’t be. Some people are meant to carry jade, and some aren’t. You are,\nand so is your little brother, same as your da and grandda. Here, hold the\ntalon knife—don’t you have one of your own yet? Gods, you should, I ought\nto have seen to that already. Go on, it’s only a few stones; it won’t hurt you.”\nLan held the weapon and spun it in his grip the way he’d practiced with a\ntoy knife. The jade pieces in the hilt were smooth to the touch and made his\nchest buzz in a warm and pleasant way, as if he’d taken a great gasp of air\nafter holding his breath for a long time. His father looked on approvingly.\nLan said, “So what happened, after the king killed his family?”\nKaul Du took his talon knife and returned it to its sheath. “With the Hunto\nroyal family all dead, the kingdoms of Jan and Tiedo invaded and carved it\nup between them, then went to war with each other. Eventually, Kekon was\nunited. From then on it was decreed for the safety of the country that those\nwho govern would not wear jade, and those who wear jade would not\ngovern.”\nIn the other room, Hilo’s colicky screams, which had blissfully abated,\nstarted up again with renewed vigor. “Curse that howler demon of a baby,”"

The oft-\nquoted Kekonese old wives’ tale was that the more unmanageable the infant,\nthe better fighter he was destined to become. In the distance, a new sound\npierced the night: air-raid sirens over Janloon, shrieking atop Hilo’s bawling.\nLan’s father ignored the noise and continued in a calm undertone. “A man\nwho wears the crown of a king can’t wear the jade of a warrior. Gold and\njade, never together. We Green Bones live by aisho. We defend the country\nfrom its enemies and the weak from the strong.” Kaul Du held his son out at\narm’s length. His left eye narrowed and his expression grew thoughtful.\n“After this war is over, after the Shotties are defeated, the clan will have to\nrebuild the country and protect the people from disorder. Ah, I don’t think I’ll\nbe alive to see it, Lan-se, but you’ll have to be a different kind of Green Bone\nthan me.”\n“I want you to pass a law,” Lan said to Chancellor Son. “One that prevents\nany one clan from gaining majority shareholder status of the Kekon Jade\nAlliance.”\nThe chancellor pursed his thick lips. “Interesting,” he said slowly,\n“considering that ownership structure of the KJA has remained largely\nunchanged for the past fifteen years, with the two largest clans in the country\neach holding roughly equal ownership.”\n“Thirty-nine percent held by the Mountain, thirty-five percent by No\nPeak, with the rest divided among the minor clans,” Lan clarified. “And if I\nmight correct you, Chancellor, the most recent shift occurred last year, when\nthe Mountain increased their ownership by two and half percent after\nannexing the Three Run clan. Which they accomplished by killing all the\njaded members of the Run family.” Chancellor Son grimaced, and Lan\nsuppressed a wry quirk of the mouth. It never hurt to remind politicians that\nGreen Bones operated on a different standard of speed and violence.\n“Is this law you’re proposing a … defensive move, Kaul-jen?” Son’s\nvoice was coolly probing now. An indent formed between his thick gray\neyebrows as they drew together. Lan could guess at what the man was\nthinking: Did he have reason to fear that the Mountain might conquer the\nsmaller clans, or gods forbid, take No Peak itself?\n“It’s a defensive move for the country,” Lan said firmly. “The KJA was\nformed after the war under the reasonable assumption that Green Bones\nshould be in charge of managing the country’s jade supply. The thinking was\nthat naturally all the clans would have a vested interest in cooperating to\nrestrict and protect the supply of jade. But that was before the invention of\nSN1, before money from foreign exports started rolling in, and before …\ncertain changes of leadership in the major clans.”\nSon was blunt. “Do you think the Mountain is seeking to control the\nKJA?”\n“I think it’s in the national interest to remove that temptation.”\n“The national interest, or No Peak’s interest?”"

Any law the council passes regarding the KJA would\napply equally to my clan as it would to Ayt Madashi’s.” He leaned forward\nso his elbows rested on Son’s desk. The motion tugged up his shirt sleeves,\nand for a second the chancellor’s eyes flicked down to the glimpse of the\njade-studded cuffs on Lan’s forearms. “Jade is our national resource; it\nshould never be controlled by any one person or group. There needs to be a\nbalance of power.”\nChancellor Son scratched the side of his face and said thoughtfully, “It\nwould be difficult to word such a law to prevent circumvention. A\ndetermined party could work through subsidiaries or intermediaries to gain a\ncontrolling interest.”\n“I’m sure the government has clever people who could figure it out.” Lan\nrelaxed his tone, realizing with satisfaction that they were moving from the if\ninto the how. “Trigger an automatic redistribution of ownership among the\nother shareholders if any one clan and its affiliates reaches a forty-five\npercent ownership threshold. Or create a provision that nationalizes the KJA\nif it falls under single-clan control. I don’t think there would ever be need to\ntake such an extreme measure,” Lan added, upon seeing the chancellor’s\nincredulous expression, “but it would dissuade any clan from thinking it can\ncontrol the country’s jade by eliminating rivals.”\nSon breathed out heavily through his nose and drummed his sausage\nfingers on the desk. “A law isn’t made and enacted by magic or by my will\nalone, of course,” he said with a smile. “It would need to pass the Royal\nCouncil; for that, we would need the support of every No Peak–affiliated\nmember and nearly all the independents.”\n“It’s a good thing, then,” said Lan with an equally meaningful smile, “that\nI came directly to someone whose friendship to the clan is so old and strong.\nA man who has the influence to make these things happen.”\nThe chancellor grunted and gave a little wave of his hand but looked\npleased. Before entering political life, Son Tomarho had been a reasonably\nwealthy Lantern Man in the No Peak clan. His daughters now ran the family\ntextile business and still paid their clan tributes in the proper amounts and on\ntime. Son was the highest No Peak man in government; everyone knew that.\nNearly all the councilmen and their staff in Wisdom Hall were affiliated with\none of the Green Bone clans; the council treasurer, in the office down the hall\nfrom Son, was a well-known Mountain loyalist.\nGold and jade, never together, Lan’s father had told him more than\ntwenty-five years ago. The axiom had not turned out to be as simple as that.\nAfter the war, the Green Bones, led by the examples of Kaul Sen and Ayt Yu,\nhad indeed faithfully acted in accordance with aisho, eschewing political\npower and retiring to private life.

But they were out of the shadows for good.\nThey no longer hid and trained in the mountains, but lived openly in the cities\nthey’d fought to liberate. In the years of postwar chaos and rapid growth, the\ncommon people continued to look to them for protection and favors just as\nthey had under decades of oppressive foreign rule, and they provided it. Their\nsecret network of affiliates—the Lantern Men—became a vehicle for\nbusiness instead of war. They wielded influence and granted appointments\nand contracts to comrades and loyal allies from the occupation days. Those\nthat the Shotarians had branded as criminals had become the ruling class of\nthe island. And while not formally a part of the Kekonese government, the\nclans were so enmeshed in its workings that the two had become, in many\nways, indistinguishable.\nIt was why, coming to this meeting, Lan had had no doubt of its eventual\noutcome—Son Tomarho would do as Lan had asked. It was only a matter of\nhow quickly, how enthusiastically, and at what price. Now the chancellor sat\nback and said, with the practiced friendliness of a senior statesmen, “Kaul-\njen, you know me. I want what’s best for the country, and I agree with you\none hundred percent. We are in full accord on this issue. But I anticipate that\nit might be difficult to get all the votes we need. Loyal to the clan as they may\nbe, some of the councilmen would be wary of publicly supporting something\nthat appears to deliberately single out the Mountain’s behavior. It would be\nmuch easier to garner support for your proposal if the clan gave some sign\nthat it was eager to take other substantial steps in the public interest.”\n“Didn’t we agree that creating this law is itself a large step in the public\ninterest?” Of course, Lan had anticipated that Son would push for more, but\nsecretly, he was annoyed all the same. The chancellor ought to realize that\nprotecting the KJA from one-clan rule was within his civic duty to pursue\nregardless of whether No Peak granted him other patronage requests. But\nLantern Man habits died hard.\n“We did, we did,” Son conceded amiably, “but the common citizens also\nhave more immediate, more tangible concerns. The smooth functioning of\nour city port, for example. As you surely know, there was a workers’ strike in\nthe Docks some months ago that dragged on to the city’s detriment. My\nfamily and several others asked for assistance from the Horn of No Peak but\nwere, unfortunately, not granted it.”\n“I leave the Horn’s decisions to the Horn,” Lan said, “and in this specific\ncase, I agree with his judgment.” The Son family and other Lantern Man\npetitioners had wanted Hilo to send his men to intimidate the union bosses\nand break up their gatherings, rough folks up if needed, force them back to\nwork. Hilo had snorted. “What do they think we are? Hired thugs?” The\nworkers in the Docks were No Peak constituents, too. The union bosses paid\ntribute. Lan had been impressed by his brother that time. Hilo was never\nhesitant to show force, but at least he was calculating about it, and he knew\nnot to let Lantern Men think they could get away with asking for too much.\nNow, though, Lan needed Son’s cooperation, so he said, “I appreciate"

I’m sure there’s something we can do to ease the strain. The\nWeather Man is especially busy these days, so I’ll ask Woon-jen to make\nsure this is prioritized.”\nIn saying this, Lan communicated that he was giving Woon permission to\nspeak. As was expected of any subordinate member of the clan in this\nsituation, he had remained entirely silent as the Pillar alone did the talking,\nbetraying no emotion but carefully observing the opposing party so he could\nlater corroborate or dispel his boss’s impressions. Now, though, the Pillarman\nleaned forward and Lan waited, with some nervousness, to see how his test\nwould go.\nWoon said, “Chancellor, I understand that some industries, textile and\ngarments for example, are facing stiff competition from foreign imports.\nPerhaps a clan-enforced tariff at point of entry would help level the playing\nfield for our Kekonese producers?”\nLan was pleased. It was a good thing to offer: Increasing dock taxes on\nimported foreign textiles would bring in revenue for the clan, would be fairly\neasy to implement and enforce, and would benefit the Son family’s business\nhandsomely without granting too much for nothing to other Lantern Men.\nThe chancellor was pretending to ponder Woon’s words, but Lan could see\nthe satisfied smile he was holding in check. “Yes, that would indeed be\nbeneficial.”\nLan stood up, straightening his cuffs. “We’re agreed, then.”\nThe chancellor heaved himself to his feet and walked them to the door of\nhis office. “Your grandfather—may he live three hundred years—how is he\nthese days, Kaul-jen?”\n“Sadly, age steals from all of us eventually, even Green Bones,” Lan said\nmildly, recognizing the seemingly considerate question for what it was: a\nprying into how much Kaul Sen still ran No Peak from behind his grandson.\nSon wanted to know if he could count on the agreements he’d made with Lan\nto be the final word from the clan. “My grandfather is not his old self, but he\nis still well, and enjoying his much-deserved retirement.”\nSon touched his soft, meaty hands to his forehead in salute.\nCHAPTER\n15\nA Bargain with Demons\nO\nutside the warehouse stood a dozen souped-up Torroyo motorcycles in the\ngarish neon shades preferred by Janloon’s northside bikers: violent red, lime\ngreen, electric blue. Hilo paused to admire a couple of them, patting the\ncontoured leather seat of a particularly striking vehicle, bending to examine\nthe gleaming engine and peering briefly over the dash before continuing on to\nthe aluminum door of the repurposed building, which vibrated with the\npounding bass of loud music.\nWith him were Maik Tar and two senior Fingers that Hilo hoped to soon\npromote to Fists: The clever but slightly pudgy and unassuming Obu had\nbetter Deflection than anyone Hilo had ever met, but needed to learn how to\ncommand if he was to advance; the other Finger, Iyn, had no especially\nsuperlative jade talent, but like many female Green Bones, particularly on the"

Iyn Ro and Maik Tar had an on-again,\noff-again relationship, which was currently off; they were too similar, and as\nlovers, they fought like cats.\nThe four Green Bones strode into the motorcycle gang’s headquarters.\nRoughly twenty bikers, almost all between the ages of sixteen and twenty-\nfive, were sprawled on battered old sofas, drinking and smoking, some\nshooting pool, a few watching television. Three men were openly counting a\npile of money in one corner. Hilo looked around with interest. As far as\ngangs in the Coinwash district went, the Chrome Demons maintained one of\nthe better equipped and appointed abodes, with relatively less filth, vermin,\nand drugged indolence.\nAll eyes turned to the intruders. A second later, every member of the\nChrome Demons was on his feet, hands going for guns and knives and\nwhatever other weapons were on hand: bottles, pool cues. The trio of men in\nthe corner jumped up and tried, amusingly, to hide the large stack of money\nbehind them.\nTar shouted, “Listen up, curs!” Someone shut off the music.\n“Who owns the beautiful fire-red Torroyo RP550 out front?” Hilo asked.\n“I do,” came a reply from the back of the room. A surly man stepped\nforward. He was heavily built and, typical for his gang, wore a leather jacket\nwith the sleeves sliced into tatters. His thick hair was styled into two stiff and\nvaguely phallic humps on his head. He appeared a few years older than most\nof the youths around him, and Hilo deduced from his superior vehicle and his\nauthoritative swagger that he was the leader of this cell of Demons.\n“What do you value more, your face or your bike?” Hilo asked him.\n“What?” growled the man uncomprehendingly.\n“Your face or your bike,” Hilo repeated. “Which would you choose?”\nThe man’s eyes flicked down to the jade studs visible across Hilo’s\ncollarbone, and then over at Maik, Obu, and Iyn. “My face,” he said\nhesitantly.\nInstantly, Hilo struck him, breaking his nose. The man fell back, eyes\nstreaming, stunned with pain; he hadn’t even had time to raise his hands in\ndefense. A few of the younger Demons, who were less wise to the world,\nmade sudden moves to unload their pistols, but before a single shot could be\nfired, Obu flung a Deflection that hurled every member of the gang back\nagainst the walls and caused the sofas and heavy pool table to skid out of\nplace.\nAs the Chrome Demons staggered back to their feet, Hilo said reasonably,\n“We’ve heard many complaints about the noise and disorderliness of street\nracing in this neighborhood. Also the number of robberies is getting out of\nhand. It’s obvious from such fine rides parked outside that the Chrome\nDemons are not short on money. So it’s only fair you criminals should pay"

So it’s only fair you criminals should pay\ntribute to the clan that takes care of the law-abiding people you so carelessly\ninconvenience.”\nAs Hilo spoke, Iyn walked the warehouse floor with a large canvas bag,\ncollecting the ample pile of cash from the back table and confiscating guns\nwith businesslike efficiency. With Maik and Obu watching every move, no\none dared to put up an additional fight. The Chrome Demons were a rough\nlot, with street-hardened, tattooed, glowering killers among them, but many\nof them rapidly handed over their weapons and money in resignation; they’d\nobviously been fined by Green Bones before and understood that they were\nguaranteed to get out alive if they cooperated and guaranteed not to if they\ndidn’t. Clan oversight over every aspect of society, including crime, was\nlargely accepted as part of life in Janloon. One foolish man leered at Iyn, but\nshe turned such an eagerly murderous look on him that he stopped contritely\nand emptied his pockets before she could break any of his bones. Hilo was\npleased with both of his Fingers; so far they had taken their cues from him\nand applied the proper amount of force. Neither had overreacted, yet no one\nin the room questioned they would shed blood without hesitation. It was a\ntricky balance that a Green Bone had to strike.\nIyn came back and set the bag of weapons and money on the ground at\nHilo’s feet. “Normally,” he said, “I would take your ill-acquired gains and\nleave you with the warning that if I heard more complaints I would send you\nand your bikes to the bottom of the harbor. But that’s something I could’ve\nsent any of my Fists to do. It’s not why I’m here.”\n“Why the fuck are you here?” slurred the leader, holding his face.\n“Good of you to ask,” said Hilo. “You know of Three-Fingered Gee?”\n“Gee’s dead,” someone in the room called out.\n“Feeding the worms,” Hilo agreed. “The man who killed him works for\nthe Mountain. I’m sure of it, but I want to know how. I want to know what\nhe’s doing and who he’s working with. A lot of this”—Hilo nudged the sack\nof money and guns with his foot—“comes from the brewing and selling of\nstreet shine to jade thieves and smugglers. The sort of folks that buy and trade\nwith black market carvers like Tem Ben. So here’s my offer: Follow your\ncontacts. Your thieves and pickpockets, your shine dealers and pimps. Do it\nquietly. Find me Tem Ben and as many of those who work with him as you\ncan, and I’ll walk out, leaving this bag on the floor.” Hilo turned his hands up\nand gestured magnanimously around the disordered warehouse. “Obu, Iyn,\nand Maik Tar will come back expecting news, but you won’t see me again so\nlong as you don’t cause any more trouble in No Peak territory. What you do\nor take from across the border, however—in Fishtown or the Stump—that,\nI’m willing to overlook.”"

        "text": "long as you don’t cause any more trouble in No Peak territory. What you do\nor take from across the border, however—in Fishtown or the Stump—that,\nI’m willing to overlook.”\nThere was a pregnant silence punctuated by murmuring shuffles. The\nHorn of No Peak had, with certain caveats, essentially given the Chrome\nDemons a free pass. A reprieve from clan repression and taxation in\nexchange for information, and he’d all but encouraged them to wreak havoc\nin Mountain territory and steal back across to Coinwash without repercussion\nif they could get away with it. The men in the warehouse shifted with dubious\nexcitement; the Horn must be angry indeed. Clan war might spell\nopportunity.\n“We should agree, Okan,” one of the younger bikers said in an eager\nwhisper to the leader, who was staunching his bleeding nose with his shirt.\n“I’ll decide what we do,” Okan snarled at the youth, evidently trying to\nreassert his severely diminished authority. He turned back around and\nfrowned fearsomely at the intrusive Green Bones but did not quite meet their\neyes, staring instead at the bag between the Horn’s feet. The man had no jade\naura, of course, but Hilo could still Perceive the tension in him clearly:\nhumiliation and pain, warring with the growing sullen awareness that he was\nbeing offered something he would be deeply foolish to refuse. At last he said,\n“So do we get a cut when you take out Tem Ben and the Mountain’s people?”\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” Hilo said sharply, and the easy manner that he’d\ndisplayed thus far vanished so quickly that everyone in the warehouse, even\nHilo’s own people, flinched at the change. “That’s clan business. You find\nme Tem and tell me about his activities and connections, but what happens\nafter that is between Green Bones. I’m putting you in a better spot than the\nReds or the Seven Ones or any of the other gangs. You abuse my generous\nnature on No Peak ground and I’ll find out, and gods help you. Now tell me\nyour answer.”\nOkan mumbled, “All right; we understand each other. We agree.”\n“That’s ‘Yes, Kaul-jen,’ and kneel when you pledge your word to the\nHorn, you dog,” said Maik Tar angrily. Hilo thought that last bit was\nunnecessary; the gang leader was already resentful and cowed enough, and as\nmuch as Hilo appreciated the younger Maik’s fervent nature, Tar’s excitable\ncruelty detracted rather than added to the impact of the Horn’s words.\nHilo said nothing, making a mental note to himself to correct Tar later.\nInstead, he picked up the canvas bag at his feet and held it back out to Okan\nwith an air of mild ceremony, symbolically restoring enough of the man’s\nlost respect that he was reasonably confident the rest of the gang would abide\nby the agreement reached tonight.\nThe leader of the Chrome Demons, still seething, knelt in front of Hilo on\nthe concrete floor of the warehouse and raised his hands in a salute.\nCHAPTER\n16\nThe Jade Mine\nS\nhae paused to wipe the sweat from her forehead.

        "text": "CHAPTER\n16\nThe Jade Mine\nS\nhae paused to wipe the sweat from her forehead. The Espenian city of\nWindton where she’d attended business school had been an arid, high-altitude\nplace surrounded by prairie farmland and heavy manufacturing. She’d hated\nthe bitterly cold, howling foreign winters, but now she found the oppressive\nhumidity of Kekon’s mountainous interior difficult to adjust to. Despite the\nbrief downpour the night before, here on the southern side of the island, this\nwas already considered dry season. At the height of the spring blossom rains,\ntorrential downpours washed out the roads and shut down the area entirely.\nThe mine site office was a short but steep walk up a muddy path from\nwhere the driver had parked the coughing, rusted truck on a gravel lot next to\ntwo dirt-encrusted excavators. Each step in Shae’s two-day journey had been\ntaken by progressively slower means: first, the city subway to Grand Island\nStation, then the long bus ride out of Janloon to the predominantly Abukei\ntown of Pula, then the hired truck, and now the last bit covered on foot, each\nsquelching step taking her a little closer to the source of jade itself.\nThe canopy of green overhead filtered the sunlight that cut through the\nhigh branches in bright shafts. The chittering of birds and the occasional hoot\nof a monkey reminded her of how vibrant and alive the forest was, and\ndespite the fact that her shirt clung unpleasantly to her skin and beads of\nsweat ran down between her breasts and made her itch, Shae felt happy to\nhave agreed to Lan’s request after all. Janloon was a study in contradictions\nthat could befuddle even someone born there: a bubbling, dirty stew and a\nmodern, glamorous metropolis at the same time, a place overly conscious of\ntrying to be a world-class city, despite being at its core a system of clan\nfiefdoms.\nOutside the city, though, Kekon was a lovely island. Shae could see why\nin ancient times foreign sailors had called it the “cursed beauty.” Being up\nhere on the mountain was just the thing she’d needed to remind herself\nviscerally why she’d returned. There was something special about her home,\nabout being Kekonese, that ran deeper than the unavoidable difficulties of\nbeing a Kaul.\nThe mine supervisor’s office was a small shack that looked as if it had\nsurvived a few landslides and still clung precariously to the mountain by dint\nof the logs roughly driven into the ground on its downslope side to prop up its\ntilting walls. Shae knocked on the door. She could hear the rumble of\nmachinery and activity down in the mine pit, so someone must be on duty.\nShe waited, but when no one answered, she opened the door and went\nstraight in.\nShe found the supervisor engrossed in watching a relayball game on the\nsmall black-and-white television in the back room. He jumped when she\nwalked in. “Who are you?” He shut the television off hastily and looked her\nup and down in surprise. She guessed he did not get young city women\ncoming up here often, even ones in dirt-caked boots and trousers rolled\nhalfway up their calves.\n“I knocked, but you must not have heard me,” Shae said."

I’m half deaf,” he said. “What do you want? Are you\nwith anyone?” He squinted at her suspiciously. It wasn’t unheard of for\nspectacularly unwise thieves to try to steal from the mine site itself. The\nsupervisor glanced at his desk, where, Shae guessed, he kept his gun.\n“I’m here to inspect the operations and your records,” Shae explained.\n“I wasn’t told anything about an inspection. Under whose authority are\nyou here?”\n“Under the authority of my brother, Kaul Lanshinwan, the Pillar of No\nPeak.” Shae pulled out an envelope and handed it over. The supervisor broke\nthe seal and scanned the letter, frowning. It was written in Lan’s hand, signed\nwith his name and his title as a director on the board of the Kekon Jade\nAlliance, and stamped with the clan’s circular insignia in red ink.\nThe supervisor folded the letter and looked up at Shae with grudging\npoliteness. “Very well. What would you like to see, Kaul-jen? Miss Kaul?”\nHe studied her uncomfortably again, clearly confused that she did not appear\nto be wearing any jade.\n“Miss Kaul is fine,” she said. “If you wouldn’t mind taking me out to see\nthe work site?”\nThe supervisor grumbled a little to himself but ushered her out of the back\nroom into the office proper. He put on a brimmed straw hat and led the way\nout of the sagging building and down the path that followed the ridge. The\nnoise of machinery grew louder, drowning out the sounds of the forest. As\nthey walked, Shae felt a flutter of sensation that prickled her skin like a shift\nin the damp air. It grew stronger with each step she took, until it became an\nunmistakable tug in the gut, pulling her like a cord through the navel as they\nemerged from the trees onto a ledge that overlooked the entire stadium-sized\npit. Shae let out a soft breath of awe.\nIn the old Abukei myths Shae remembered Kyanla telling her as a child,\nthe First Mother goddess, Nimuma, fell into the ocean and perished from\nexertion after creating the world. Her body became the island of Kekon, and\nthe veins of jade that ran under these mountains were her bones. Her green\nbones. If she imagined it like that, Shae thought, then the scene below was\nthe largest grave-digging operation imaginable. Here, the most valuable and\ncoveted gemstone in the world was exposed to the air and pulled from the\nearth. From where Shae stood on the ledge, the huge rock-breaking machines\nand rickety aluminum-roofed buildings were the size of toy models and the\nAbukei workers were small figures moving industriously around hills of\ndebris. The air smelled of diesel exhaust and vibrated with the shrill whine of\nwater-cooled diamond saws cutting into rock. Among the boulders on the\nground, and in the beds of the enormous flatbed trucks where the muddy gray\nrocks had been cut apart, she saw the green gleam of raw jade."

She put a\nhand out to grip the railing as the soles of her muddy boots clanged down the\nlatticed steel walk. The supervisor followed after her. “Stop at the sign,\nplease!” he shouted over the rumbling noise of trucks and heavy equipment.\nAt the bottom of the second-to-last ramp was a small observation deck\nand a large mounted sign. ATTENTION. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY BEYOND\nTHIS POINT. THIS AREA IS HAZARDOUS TO THOSE WITH JADE SENSITIVITY. PROCEED\nAT YOUR OWN RISK!\nShae stopped. There was more raw jade here than was properly safe for\nanyone without immunity to be exposed to. Shae watched the Abukei\nworkers walking on the ground below. They wore hard hats, thick gloves, and\nmuddy canvas pants but worked bare-chested in the heat. Like their\nancestors, only they could safely live deep in the interior of Kekon. In the\nmodern world, the Abukei had carved out their second-class place in society\nbased on their immunity. The scrawny workers down there worked all day,\nevery day, leaning up casually against the huge boulders and touching all that\nlustrous green without feeling what Shae felt now—the woozy craving in the\nbottom of her stomach, even deeper and more gnawing than hunger.\nDeep-seated Kekonese prejudice maintained that the Abukei were an\ninferior race, but Shae had studied history and science at an Espenian\nuniversity and knew that belief was erroneous. The Abukei had inhabited\nKekon centuries before the first arrival of settlers from Tun, so in truth they\nwere the survivors. They lived unaffected by the substance that drove later\nexplorers to murder each other or throw themselves into the sea. Ironic then,\nthat now the more fortunate Abukei such as these ones worked for the Kekon\nJade Alliance, performing back-breaking labor in order to drink and gamble\nand whore away their earnings during the idle three-month height of the rainy\nseason, while the less fortunate of their kin squatted in ramshackle huts by\nthe river and dove for runoff.\nShae took a few more steps down the catwalk. If she’d been wearing any\njade at all, the thrum of energy vibrating through her body would have been\ntoo much, overwhelming. The supervisor called, “Miss Kaul, did you read the\nsign?”\n“I’m not going far,” she shouted back. What would happen if she ignored\nhim and went up to one of those boulders and placed the flat of her hand on\nthe raw jade? She wondered if it would knock her unconscious or stop her\nheart. Would she, for an instant, experience a moment of unsurpassed power\nand clarity that would make her feel like a moth burning in ecstasy in a\nflame? Or would it have no immediate effect, but tomorrow, or a week or\nmonth from now, would she lose her mind in stages, and start cutting herself\nwhen the Itches came?\nPay attention.

Shae pulled\na pad of paper and a pen from her canvas rucksack and leaned over the\nrailing, counting the trucks and workers. She made note of how many\nbulldozers and excavators were on-site. Everything seemed to be in working\norder, nothing unusual or out of place. The men were dark and ropy from\nhard labor, but they seemed to be healthy, efficient.

When they\nreached the tilting office again, Shae said, “I’d like to see the last two years’\nworth of financial records.”\n“The KJA has it all in their files,” the supervisor said. “You could get\ncopies from the Weather Man’s staff in Janloon. All we have are original\nexpense reports—”\n“I’d like to see them, please,” Shae said.\nReluctantly, the man led her back into the room with the television. He\nopened a closet and turned on a single naked bulb. The closet was packed\nwith cardboard filing boxes, stacked on top of each other and organized by\nthe dates written on them in thick black marker. He cleared the television off\nthe folding table and wiped the layer of dust off its surface with his bare\nforearm. It left damp streaks. “You can use this table,” he offered, clearly\nresentful that she would make it impossible for him to sit back down in front\nof his relayball game for some time.\n“Thank you,” Shae said. “Would you please tell the driver of the truck I\nhired to wait. I may be a few hours. Do you have a copy machine?”\nThe man pointed it out to her, then left her alone. Shae could hear him\nclomping around, then turning on the radio in the other room. She found the\nmost recently dated cardboard box, hefted it out of the closet and onto the\nsmall table, and opened it. She pulled out the first thick file folder and sat\ndown. Daily production reports. She flipped to an empty page on her pad of\npaper, then sat down and started to read. This was going to take a while.\nIt felt a little strange to examine the mining of jade with such analytical\ndetachment. Scanning the dull files, jade mining came off like any other\nbusiness, one with inputs and outputs, revenue and expenses. There were\naccounting statements, and invoices, and purchase orders. No different really\nthan anything else that people manufactured and sold. Traditional Abukei\nfolklore connected jade to the First Mother and the creation of the world. The\nDeitists believed it was a divine gift from the gods—the path to human\nsalvation. Some foreign religions said it was an evil substance from the devil,\na belief the Shotarians had forcibly espoused during their decades of rule.\nJade was imbued with so much myth and emotion, so much mystery and\npower, and yet, here it was—boring. Something to be dug up, cut up, moved,\ncarved, polished, sold for profit.\nShe made copies of the pages she thought were of importance, then\nmoved on to the next folder. Personnel manifests. She flipped through them."

She flipped through them.\nShe wondered what exactly she was looking for. Lan had told her to audit the\noperations, but he hadn’t told her precisely what he thought might be out of\nplace. The personnel lists corroborated the rising salary costs. There had been\nlittle turnover, but a couple of injuries and a number of new hires. It all\nseemed very ordinary. Some of the reports used technical terms, acronyms,\nand abbreviations she wasn’t familiar with, but she possessed a solid enough\ngrasp of the Kekonese mining sector to understand most of it. During her last\ntwo years at the Academy, she’d been tutored by Yun Doru, back when the\nclan had aspirations for her to hold a high post on the business side of No\nPeak—perhaps, even, to one day succeed Doru as Weather Man.\nUnlike her brothers, Shae had not had a lot of friends at Kaul Du\nAcademy. Of the other female students, the one she was closest to was Wan\nPayadeshan, the talented but shy daughter of a middling Lantern Man. Paya’s\nmother had died from illness some years ago, and Shae often brought her\nfriend over to the Kaul house. One day Shae was searching for something,\nshe could not even remember what, when she stumbled upon a manila\nenvelope full of photographs in Doru’s desk. Pretty Paya, in her underwear,\nPaya on her hands and knees, wearing a dog collar, Paya naked, legs spread,\npale and awkward looking, eyes moist.\nHer friend had cried in shame and abject relief when Shae told her never\nto come back to the house. She begged Shae to understand: She wasn’t that\nkind of girl, she’d never wanted to do it, but Doru-jen was being so good to\nher father’s business, what could she have said or done?\nShae told her grandfather that she would not be tutored by Doru anymore.\nShe’d learn whatever else she needed to about the clan business from the\nsenior Luckbringers such as Hami Tumashon, but she would not have\nanything more to do with the Weather Man. Be reasonable, Shae-se, Kaul\nSen had said. Every man has weaknesses; you don’t know what they did to\nDoru-jen during the war; he has never treated you with any disrespect.\nYears away had not dimmed Shae’s loathing of Yun Dorupon. He’d cost\nher not just a friend, but the once matchless admiration she’d had for her\ngrandfather.\nShae rummaged in her sack for a lunch tin—onion buns, shredded\nvegetables, and a marinated egg from the kitchen of last night’s inn—along\nwith a bottle of water. She ate as she continued to peruse documents. The\nmine supervisor poked his head into the room to ask how she was doing;\nShae said she was fine. She’d figured out the filing system now and was\nefficiently pulling and copying the monthly financial summaries so she could\nread them in greater detail later and compare them with annual KJA\nstatements.

Her plan was to rent a room in Pula; that way she could come\nback up the mountain if she needed to. Even if she didn’t find anything\nparticularly interesting to report back to Lan, she would treat it as a working\nholiday of sorts, doing something useful while taking the time to relax in the\nmountains before having to begin her job hunt in earnest. At the very least,\nshe would familiarize herself with the mining operations, and if she could\ngive Lan some advice on how to make improvements, she’d be putting her\nbusiness degree to some immediate use. She lifted the lid on a new box and\nopened the next file. Equipment purchase orders.\nThe mine had made several significant capital investments in the past year\n—diamond-tipped core drills, heavy hydraulic spreaders, larger capacity\ntrucks—most of it going to new and expanded mine sites. It struck Shae as\npoor planning to absorb all the cost in a single year; she wondered if the\nWeather Man’s office applied any pressure on the KJA to do proper\ninvestment appraisals. She wrote Capital budgeting?! in her notebook, then\npulled another folder she’d marked and checked the financial statements; first\nyear depreciation on new equipment was indeed driving most of the rise in\noperating expenses. Mine production was up fifteen percent over last year,\nthough the increase hadn’t been realized as revenue yet; perhaps the KJA was\nholding all that extra jade in inventory? The cartel kept strict control over\nhow much jade was allotted to Green Bone schools, Deitist temples, and\nother licensed users in the military or healthcare fields, and how much was\nsold—primarily to the Espenian government. The rest was kept locked away\nin a massive national vault underneath the Kekon Treasury building.\nShae’s eyes skipped over the equipment purchase order pages one more\ntime. Her gaze landed on the signature at the bottom. It was not one that she\nhad seen anywhere else in the files. She studied it for a second before she\nrealized whose name it was: Gont Aschentu. The Horn of the Mountain.\nWhy would the leader of the military arm of the Ayt clan be signing\nmining equipment purchase orders? Although the Green Bone clans were\ncontrolling stakeholders of the KJA, the mines themselves were state-\noperated, not managed by the clans directly. The annual budget for the\nmine’s operations was approved by the KJA board, so any signature on this\nform ought to be from a representative that sat on or answered to the board—\neither Doru, or Ree Tura, the Weather Man of the Mountain, or one of their\ndirect subordinates. What could it mean that Gont’s signature was on this\npage, and several others?\nShae copied all the pages and tucked them carefully into her bag. She\nreplaced the files, put the box back into the closet, and left the room. She\nwouldn’t be staying in Pula tonight after all. She had a long trip back to the\ncity and needed to get on the road as quickly as possible.\nCHAPTER\n17\nNight at the Lilac Divine\nT\nhe charm girl’s voice was exquisite, by turns operatically high and pure,\nthen sultry and suggestive.

        "text": "CHAPTER\n17\nNight at the Lilac Divine\nT\nhe charm girl’s voice was exquisite, by turns operatically high and pure,\nthen sultry and suggestive. She played the Tuni harp and sang with eyes\nclosed, her dainty head and waves of dark hair swaying to the melody.\nResting on the plush cushions, Lan let the tension drop out of his shoulders,\nand his mind fall quietly into the music. He was the only one in the opulent\nroom; this was a private performance. The song was about a lost traveler\nmissing his island home. No one here would have the poor tact to sing him\nlyrics about love or heartbreak.\nLan was accustomed to traveling with one or two bodyguards, but he\ncame to the Lilac Divine Gentleman’s Club alone. He wanted to enjoy\nhimself without being tailed by anyone else in the clan. While he was here,\nhe didn’t want to think about being the Pillar. Mrs. Sugo, the Lantern Man\nowner of the Lilac Divine, was appreciative of that fact, and could be counted\non for her discretion as well as her excellent taste. There was never any\ntrouble at this place either; everyone knew it was a No Peak–frequented\nestablishment, and a person would have to be suicidal to cause problems,\neven if the gambling downstairs got out of hand.\nGreen Bones could take credit for certain things, Lan figured. On the\nwhole, Janloon was one of the safest cities in the world. The clans kept out\nforeign criminals and gangsters, stamped down street crime, and taxed and\ncontrolled vice at a level acceptable to the politicians and the public. If some\nof Mrs. Sugo’s late-night offerings were not entirely legal, she had the good\nsense to make her clan tribute payments timely and generous, and to spare no\neffort in making Lan’s visits enjoyable.\nYunni, the charm girl, stretched out the last melancholy note of the song,\nher throat vibrating as her fingers danced lightly across the harp strings. Lan\nset down his wineglass and applauded. Yunni ducked her chin with false\nshyness, looking up at him through dusted eyelashes. “Did you enjoy that\none, Lan-jen?”\n“Very much so. It was beautiful.”\nShe started to stand and let the silk scarf fall from her shoulders, but Lan\nsaid, “Do you have another song?”\nShe sat back down gracefully. “Something a little more cheerful,\nperhaps?” She plucked at the strings and launched into a lighthearted ballad.\nLan rested his eyes on the curve of her neck and the plump red gloss of\nher moving lips. He admired the way her gauzy dress hung off the slopes of\nher breasts and pale thighs. It was getting easier to work himself up to being\nwith her. As Pillar, he could have any of the girls here, more than one at a\ntime if he wanted, but the first few times he’d come, after he’d accepted that\nEyni was gone for good, all he’d asked for was to sit and listen to Yunni sing.\nHe’d told himself he didn’t want sex—just an escape, just company.

She was neither overly deferential nor too eager to please; she\nconversed with him about music and foreign films but never asked him to say\nanything about the clan or its affairs. When he did finally take her to bed, he\nfound her pleasing and energetic.\nTonight, though, he found it harder than usual to forget his worries. There\nhad been no further communication between the clans for over two months,\nbut Lan knew that Ayt could read his actions clearly enough. He’d declined\nthe Mountain’s proposal to join forces in producing SN1, he’d set Chancellor\nSon to proposing KJA reforms, and instead of removing Hilo, he’d allowed\nhis brother to bolster clan presence along all territorial borders. He believed\nhe’d acted correctly in each case, but Lan knew he was walking a perilous\nline, particularly with the latter decision.\nJust last week, there’d been a spate of motorcycle gang violence between\nCoinwash and Fishtown—enough to garner a short mention in the news,\nwhich was saying something, as both neighborhoods were such crowded,\ndestitute slums that a few killings there would normally never merit attention.\nGreen Bones were not directly involved, so neither clan could claim offense,\nbut everyone knew the Horns on both sides of the border not only kept the\ncriminal class in line but manipulated it as well. Lan worried that it would\ntake only one Green Bone or Lantern Man being caught or implicated in a\nviolent incident for it to escalate to something that openly involved the clans\nthemselves.\nLan knew his brother well. Subtlety was not in Hilo’s nature. He\nrespected clan hierarchy too much to ever disobey the Pillar on important\nmatters, but he had complete day-to-day authority over the clan’s activities on\nthe streets, and his personal code was to leave no doubt that he would go\nfurther than his enemies if wronged. A look would be returned with a word, a\nword with a blow, a blow with a beating, a beating with an execution.\nPerhaps it would be better to have a Horn that was more prudent and\nrestrained, who wouldn’t raise overflowing tensions even further.\nHowever, alienating his brother might be the worst possible decision.\nThere was no one who could, or would, step in to fill Hilo’s role. The Fists of\nNo Peak, and by extension the Fingers, weren’t just loyal to the clan, or to the\noffice of the Horn—they were loyal to Kaul Hilo. It disturbed Lan far more\nthan he cared to admit that, if forced to choose between him and Hilo, many\nof the Green Bone warriors in the clan might side with his younger brother.\nBy demanding that he replace his Horn as a condition for future negotiation,\nAyt was asking him to knowingly weaken and sow dissent within his own\nclan. She was placing him in a dilemma that held all the makings of a trap.\n“You look as if you could use a massage.” Yunni had finished playing her\nsong and come to sit beside him. Lan had barely noticed.\n“I’m sorry,” he said. “I know I seem distracted.”\n“You have a lot on your mind,” she said kindly. He appreciated her\npatient acceptance; it was something Eyni had not been willing to give. He"

He appreciated her\npatient acceptance; it was something Eyni had not been willing to give. He\nran a hand down her long, sleek hair and brought some of it to his face,\nenjoying the feel and smell of it as she unbuttoned his shirt and drew it over\nhis shoulders.\n“Wait,” he said. He stood up and went to the dresser in the corner of the\nroom. In the mirror, under the dim red lighting, he saw himself, bare-chested,\nand wondered if he really could live up to being the person he appeared to be\n—a strong, assured man, a hard-bodied Green Bone warrior, a leader adorned\nin jade. A man like his father.\nLan took off his jade-studded belt and the cuffs on his forearms, leaving\non only the beads he wore on a chain around his neck. He shut his belt and\ncuffs in the safe below the dresser and turned the combination lock. Yunni\nclaimed she was half Abukei, nearly a stone-eye, but he removed most of his\njade out of consideration for her anyway, just to be safe.\nIn truth, after the initial disorienting few minutes of withdrawal, he found\nit strangely relaxing to be without all his jade. His surroundings became a\nlittle foggy and soft around the edges. With his senses dimmed, he felt as if\nhe was making love in a dark room, in a pleasant dream perhaps, and could\njust let himself act without seeing too clearly, without thinking too much. He\nfelt more detached, more serene. He wondered if this made him unusual\namong Green Bones. Hilo, after all, studded jade into his body so it could\nnever be removed. Shae had gone too far in the other direction. Lan\nwondered how she could stand it, being jadeless.\nThat was another thing troubling him tonight. Last month, Shae had gone\nto the mines as he’d asked and phoned from Pula to tell him that Gont Asch\nwas ordering equipment purchases at the mines. Neither of them knew what\nto make of it; did it mean Gont was usurping Ree Tura’s authority? Three\nweeks had passed before she’d phoned him again. It was as Lan had feared.\n“I’ve gone through the numbers over and over, and it looks as though the\nequipment purchases Gont approved aren’t being reflected in the KJA’s\nfinancial statements,” Shae told him. “The Mountain has been getting\ninvolved in the mines directly without consulting the board of the KJA.” Shae\nsaid she was going to the Kekon Treasury to examine its records. She’d get\nback to him soon.\nHe’d been highly reluctant to pull Shae into the clan business, but now he\nknew it had been worthwhile. Shae had verified his mounting suspicions that\nAyt Mada had been a step ahead of his meeting with Chancellor Son and had\nalready begun to try to wrest greater control over the country’s jade supply.\nIn addition, Lan was now convinced he could not rely on Doru. There was no\nexcuse for the Weather Man to not be aware of such information, or to keep it\nfrom him. If he confronted the old advisor, he was sure Doru would deny any\nsubterfuge or negligence, give him some reasonable explanation, and go to"

No, he needed solid evidence to justify not just\nremoving the man from his post but from the inner circle. Woon would have\nto be ready to take over immediately and completely, with no transition.\nThat was another reason he couldn’t demote Hilo—the clan couldn’t be\nwithout a veteran Weather Man and a Horn at the same time. So many\nproblems.\nYunni led him to the bed, undressed him completely, and guided him\ndown onto his stomach. He closed his eyes as she rubbed his back with\nscented oil. “You’re tense,” she said soothingly, working her thumbs into the\nmuscles of his neck. “Perhaps from carrying so much jade.” The pillow under\nLan’s face hid the twist of his lips. The charm girls here knew a few things\nabout Green Bones and how to flatter them. Even the ones who wore the\nmost jade were insecure about their power.\nEveryone’s tolerance was different, though. Lan carried a considerable\namount of jade by the standards of any respectable Green Bone, but he felt no\ndesire to press his limits. Beyond a certain point, additional jade made him\nfeel off-kilter, wired, moody. The problem was, although the role of Pillar\nwas about far more than how much green a man displayed, people were\nsuperficial. According to old timers, the great Kaul Du had carried more jade\nthan any other warrior in his day. When his son’s rival, a woman Pillar,\nshowed off conspicuously more green, it was talked about. It was whispered\nas if it was a personal failing.\nYunni massaged down to his waist. She spread warm oil on her hands and\nforearms and slid them up and down his body. She reached and stroked\nbetween his legs. He wasn’t sure at what point her dress came off, but he felt\nher bare breasts rubbing against his back, her long hair trailing against his\nskin as she glided herself up and down slowly and sensually against him.\nWhen she turned him over and straddled him upside down, her bare\nstomach and crotch over his face, every troubled thought finally exited Lan’s\nmind. He lifted his head to drink in her odor as she worked her elegant\nharpist’s hands over his chest, stomach, pelvis, and inner thighs. He was truly\nimpressed by how many skills she possessed. For a few seconds, he thought\nof Eyni and missed her bitterly, but the emotion was fleeting, made dull by\nfamiliarity. His arousal flagged only briefly, returning once Yunni’s hands\nand mouth began their masterful and exciting ministrations, and when he felt\nclose to climax, he asked her to lie down. Yunni moaned and sighed, and\nwhispered, “Ah, yes, this is what I want,” grabbing his hips as he took her.\nHe came faster than he’d expected, then sagged, everything leaving him as he\nrolled off her and sank into the soft mattress.\nYunni brought a warm, moist towel and rubbed his face and neck and\nchest. “You can stay as long as you like,” she cooed.

Even if it was a skillful artifice, he appreciated it. Out of\nhabit, he closed one hand over his jade beads as the room dissolved and he\nbegan to drift off.\nThere was a knock at the door. Lan wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly; no\none ever interrupted him here. Yunni frowned in disapproval and sat up,\nreaching for a robe to cover herself. She started to get up and go to the door,\nbut Lan stopped her.\n“Who is it?” he called.\n“Kaul-jen,” came Mrs. Sugo’s voice, sounding high and apprehensive\nthrough the door. “Please forgive me for disturbing you. I would normally\nnever … but there is someone from the clan here for you. It’s very urgent.”\nLan pushed off the bed and put on his pants. “Stay here,” he said to\nYunni, then went to the safe and tried the combination twice before the lock\npopped open. He put on his belt and jade cuffs, then clutched the edge of the\ndresser with both hands as the energy surge hit him, flooding into his system.\nEverything swam, then sharpened; noise and vision and feeling blasted into\nhis skull. He breathed deeply through the adjustment, then straightened. He\nglanced at himself in the mirror again—shirtless, but with every pebble of\njade in place. He walked to the door and opened it.\nMrs. Sugo backed out of his way, white-faced. Behind her stood Maik\nKehn, breathing hard, enraged, his tan jacket splattered with blood that was\nnot his own. “The Mountain did it,” he gasped. “They whispered Hilo’s\nname.”\nFIRST INTERLUDE\nHeaven and Earth\nL\nong ago in Heaven, according to Deitist teachings, the great extended\nfamily of gods lived in dazzling palaces of jade. Like any large family, the\ngods had their share of quarrels, but for the most part they went about their\nimmortal lives happily, although once they had children and those children\nhad children, residential space in Heaven grew too tight for comfort. So the\ngods constructed a second home, which they modeled after the first and\ncalled Earth.\nEarth was, at first, in every way as beautiful as Heaven, with vast seas,\nhigh mountains, lush forests, and countless wondrous plants and animals.\nUnfortunately, the numerous children of the gods, having grown up spoiled,\nfell to squabbling over Earth even before it was completed. Several wanted\nthe same ocean, others bickered over who would take the highest mountain\nrange or the biggest continent.\nAt last, the fighting grew so constant and unbearable that the god parents\ngrew enraged. “We built a perfect home for you, and this is how you repay us\n—by spoiling it with pettiness, greed, and jealousy, turning brother against\nbrother, sister against sister.

Some, like Thana the Moon, or Poya, the\ngoddess of agriculture, took pity on their descendants and hovered close,\nhelping to light their way at night, or ensuring they had food to eat. Others,\nlike Yofo, the typhoon god, or Sagi the Pestilence, refused to give up their\ngrudges, and unless placated, would descend on occasion to remind humanity\nof its long-standing offenses.\nAll earthly conflict, so the Deitist philosophers say, stems from the\noriginal offense of the children against their parents and of siblings against\none another. All human progress and virtuous striving is likewise an attempt\nto achieve familial forgiveness and a return to the spiritually and physically\ndivine state, which lies latent but distantly remembered.\nCHAPTER\n18\nThe Whispered Name\nA\nfrantic call had come earlier in the evening from Mr. Pak, who, along\nwith his wife, had run a grocery in the Armpit for twelve years.\n“I have to go,” Hilo said to Wen after he hung up the phone.\nHe was frustrated because she refused to move out of her cramped\napartment in Paw-Paw and live with him in the Horn’s residence on the Kaul\nestate unless they were married. “I have to ask Lan properly, and then we’ll\nplan the wedding, and it’ll take months,” he’d argued. “Things are getting\nworse between the clans. I visit here too often; it’s not safe for you.”\nWen’s apartment building was only a street over from Coinwash, which\nhad seen a recent surge in violent crime. Even within No Peak territory, Hilo\nwas not willing to take any chances with Wen’s safety. He would not put it\npast the Mountain to circumvent aisho and engineer some unfortunate\naccident if they knew they could further provoke him. “If you won’t be\nreasonable, I’ll have to post Fingers to watch over you, which means Fingers\nthat I won’t have elsewhere. The house is secure. Bigger, too. You could fix\nit up, you’re good at that. You’d like it.”\nWen folded her arms and gazed at him with immovability. “I’m not going\nto give your family any additional reasons to look down on me. We’ll live\ntogether when we’re married, and not before. In the meantime, I have a gun,\nand I know how to use it. I won’t be a burden. I can take care of myself.”\n“A gun.” Hilo gave an ugly laugh. “Is that supposed to reassure me? My\nenemies are Green Bones. You’re a stone-eye.”\n“Thank you for the reminder,” she said coolly.\nOn the street outside, Kehn honked the horn of the Duchesse and Hilo\ngrowled. “We’ll talk about this later.”"

Two young men with jade studs in their eyebrows had\nsmashed the windows, broken the neon sign over the door, and knocked over\nseveral shelves of merchandise as punishment for the couple’s failure to pay\ntribute to the Mountain clan. Hilo scowled as he surveyed the wreckage, his\nmood worsening. Nothing was stolen, but incidents like these were costing\nNo Peak dearly, not just in money to take care of the damages, but in\ngoodwill from the Lantern Men in the district.\n“I can’t pay tribute to two clans,” Mr. Pak moaned.\n“We’ll take care of it,” said Hilo. “It won’t happen again.”\nLater, there was some question as to whether the Paks had been turned by\nthe Mountain and were in on the plot. When Mr. Pak learned of what\nhappened, he cut off his own ear to proclaim his innocence and threw himself\non the mercy of Kaul Lan. The couple’s home and store were searched and\nthey were cleared of suspicion, but two months later, the Paks shut down\ntheir store and moved out of the Armpit for good.\nOn that night, however, Hilo had his Fingers ask questions until he\nlearned that the two men who’d vandalized the grocery were Yen Io and\nChon Daal, and they could be found at an all-night arcade on a busy\ncommercial strip of the Armpit. For smaller transgressions, Hilo would have\nsent one of his Fists and a couple of Fingers, but he was sick and tired of\nLan’s restraint and the bullshit situation in the Armpit. People needed to\nknow No Peak was strong here and would not be trifled with. Vibrant, noisy,\ncolorful, and seedy, the Armpit was one of Janloon’s most valuable districts.\nBy day it attracted tourists and shoppers; after dark, both stockbrokers and\ndockworkers mingled in its streets, entertaining themselves with the myriad\nof restaurants, gambling dens, bars, strip clubs, and theaters. No Peak could\nnot afford to lose ground here. Hilo decided it was necessary that he handle\nthis offense personally. The Pillar had ordered him not to take lives, but that\ndidn’t mean he couldn’t make a public statement.\nThey parked in a pay lot down the street from the Super Joy arcade. Kehn\nwas suffering from a sinus headache and was blowing his nose into a soggy\nhandkerchief. The elder Maik brother had had his cheekbone fractured in his\nteens and ever since then had a difficult time on days when the pollution and\nhumidity in Janloon were high.\n“Stay in the car,” Hilo told him. “Tar and I won’t be long.”\nKehn agreed readily, turning on the radio and lighting a smoke as Hilo\nand Tar got out and walked down the sidewalk toward the Super Joy.

As Hilo and Tar\ncrossed the street, two men raced up on motorcycles. As they roared past the\nDuchesse, Kehn understood in an instant what was happening. He shouted\nout in warning and laid hard on the Duchesse’s horn. It was not the blare of\nnoise, however, but the surge of Kehn’s visceral alarm that reached Hilo first,\na fraction of a second before he Perceived the murderous intent of the\nassassins as they opened fire with handguns.\nOne bullet tore the shoulder of Hilo’s jacket and another whined past his\near as he fell to a crouch and threw up a wall of Deflection that veered the\nshots to either side around him. They punched into car doors and the walls of\nnearby buildings. Screams erupted as people ran from the scene, pushing and\nshoving each other to get away. The salvo of gunfire was just an opening,\nmeant to stun. Both the attackers leapt, Light, from the backs of their\nmotorcycles, as Yen Io and Chon Daal appeared from the parked car where\nthey had been lying in ambush.\nHilo rose, talon knife in a fighting grip. Jade energy surged alongside\nadrenaline. The two men flew straight at him, moon blades cutting down in\nvicious arcs. Hilo slid aside and slammed his crossed wrists into one man’s\nupraised arm, cleaving into it with his talon knife. Redirecting the momentum\nof his opponent’s moon blade, he pivoted out of the way and sent the man\nstumbling forward as he jerked the talon knife across the elbow, severing\ntendons.\nThe second man’s moon blade slashed across Hilo’s midsection. He\nbarely had time to focus his Steel; as he curved his torso away from the cut,\nthe length of white metal flexed from the enormous tension, opening a bloody\ngash across Hilo’s stomach with grisly slowness as the attacker’s Strength\nmet and strained against his defenses. Hilo’s eyes met the assassin’s. He\nrecognized him: Gam Oben. Second Fist to Gont Asch.\nOnly narrowly did Hilo escape disembowelment. With a snarl of effort, he\nleapt backward, Light, onto the top of a parked car. Gam released a powerful\nwave of Deflection, and Hilo’s feet were knocked out from under him as he\nlanded; he slammed chest first onto the roof. His chin smacked metal and his\nvision wavered. He heard Maik Tar howling in pain and rage.\nThe Duchesse Priza, with Kehn at the wheel, barreled onto the street like a\nrhino. It clipped one of the motorcycles, sending it spinning, then plowed into\nChon Daal. Gam barely leapt out of the way as the boy flipped over the silver\ngrille and bounced off the hood of the car. Chon’s Steeled body shattered the\nwindshield, then flew through the air onto the sidewalk as Kehn slammed on\nthe brakes.

He lunged at Gam, but\nbefore he could reach him, the other Mountain fighter, the one whose elbow\nhe’d rended with the knife, careened into Hilo with a determined roar and\ndragged him down. As they both crashed to the asphalt, Hilo struggled,\nmanaging to wrap his arms around the man’s torso. The Green Bone’s aura\nspiked wild as he twisted in Hilo’s grip, and Hilo took all of it, all the jade\npower he could gather, and with a sharp thrust of his palm, Channeled into\nhis opponent’s heart. The assassin’s Steel buckled like balsa wood and his\nheart spasmed and burst.\nThe blowback of energy from the Green Bone’s death rocked Hilo hard.\nWith explosive force, the man’s life lit out of the confines of his body. The\nresulting jade-amplified rush was worse than a physical battering against\nHilo’s skull. He reeled; for a second he could barely breathe, and his mouth\nfilled with a bitterly sharp metallic taste. Only because he knew what was\nhappening was he able to keep his wits intact. He tore himself off the body\nbefore he could become addled. Talon knife still firmly clutched, he\nclambered to his feet and looked for the next man to kill. Instead, he saw that\nYen Io lay dead on the road by the Maiks’ hands. Gam, and Chon, who’d\nsomehow survived being thrown from the hood of the Duchesse, had fled.\nLess than two minutes had passed from the start of the attack.\nTar was leaning against the twisted grille of the car, bent over with a hand\nto his side. He’d taken bullets from the diverted gunshots meant for Hilo. His\nshirt was soaked with blood. Kehn pulled his younger brother into the back\nseat of the car. Hilo could see him pressing on the wound with both hands,\nChanneling his own energy into Tar, but he was no doctor, and could only\nslow the bleeding, not stop it.\nIcy fury rose and spread like a white mist across Hilo’s vision. It steadied\nhis body and his voice as he pointed into the throng of frightened bystanders\nthat pressed like packed fish into doorways and behind cars. “You,” he said,\npicking out a newsstand owner. “You. And you.” He pointed at two others, a\nwoman clutching her handbag to her chest, and the doorman of a club.\n“Come here!” They turned pale and looked as if they wanted to run, but did\nnot dare disobey the command in Hilo’s voice. The doorman took several\nsteps forward nervously, and the other two had no choice but to follow. Hilo\nlooked at each of them in turn, making sure they knew who he was, knew that\nhe had seen and remembered them, that he was speaking directly to them.\n“Spread the word up and down this street, and tell everyone you speak\nwith to tell others.” Hilo raised his voice so all nearby would hear. “Anyone\nwho gives me the whereabouts of the two men who fled here tonight is a\nfriend of No Peak and a friend of mine. Anyone who helps them or hides\nthem is an enemy of mine and my clan.” He pointed to one of the dead men"

Anyone who helps them or hides\nthem is an enemy of mine and my clan.” He pointed to one of the dead men\nin the street, then the other. “This is what happens to my enemies.”\nHe set to work quickly. They needed to get Tar to a hospital right away,\nbut a Green Bone was entitled to the jade of slain foes and never left it behind\nfor thieves. From the body of one man, he pulled three jade rings, a bracelet,\nand a circular pendant. From the other, he collected a belt, two eyebrow\nstuds, and a jade-backed watch. He had to hack at flesh inelegantly to get the\nrings and studs. He gathered up the jade-hilted weapons that had fallen: two\nmoon blades and a talon knife. Hilo ran back to the Duchesse. He threw open\nthe door and tossed the talon knives and moon blades onto the floor of the\npassenger side seat. “Keys,” he demanded.\nKehn fumbled in his pocket and passed them over. Hilo wiped the bloody\nfingerprints off the metal teeth with the sleeve of his shirt and started the\nengine. In the back, Tar gave a low moan. The car lurched forward, sending\nbroken windshield glass across the dash; Hilo spun the wheel around and\nslammed on the gas.\nCHAPTER\n19\nCouncil of War\nI\nt was past midnight and there was no one left in the Kekon Treasury except\nfor a couple of night security guards in the lobby and two women janitors\nwho moved from cubicle to cubicle in the records department, emptying trash\nbins and vacuuming the floors, chatting to each other in the lilting, long-\nvoweled Abukei dialect, though they kept their voices down around Shae and\ndid not disturb her at her work. The building had closed hours ago, and it was\nonly because of her identity as a Kaul and the letter in Shae’s pocket—the\none written in Lan’s hand and bearing the clan’s insignia—that she’d been\nallowed to remain at this spare desk for as long as she needed, which, for the\nlast several days, had been late into the night.\nShae put down her pen and calculator and leaned back, rubbing her eyes,\nwhich were sore from hours studying numbers underneath the unfriendly\nfluorescent lights. It occurred to her that she was nearly alone with the largest\namount of jade stored in one place in the world. Several floors below her,\nunder immense layers of concrete, were lead-lined vaults of processed jade,\ncut into various sizes from single-gram gems to one-tonne slabs. Considering\nthat it housed in its bowels a stockpile that comprised a considerable portion\nof the nation’s fortune, the Kekon Treasury was less heavily guarded than\none might expect, not only because anyone who attempted to steal from it\nwould be marked for certain death by every Green Bone clan, but because\nstate-of-the-art security systems ensured that if any vault was breached, the\nintruder would be sealed inside. Unless the thieves possessed complete\nimmunity, being locked in a vault full of jade meant a slow, agonizing\ndescent into insanity before death.\nAnd yet, someone was indeed stealing from the Kekon Treasury.

Shae had\ngone through the calculations multiple times, cross-referencing records from\nthe mines, from the Kekon Jade Alliance’s official financial statements, and\nnow, from the Treasury itself. She’d forgotten that she was good at this—\ndoggedly following hunches and crumbs of information until they arranged\nthemselves into a clear picture. Staring at the figures that covered pages of\nher notebook, even fatigue at this late hour did not blunt the astonishment and\nanger Shae felt as she saw with finality her suspicions borne out in cold, hard\nmath. The mines were producing jade that was neither being officially\naccounted for by the Kekon Jade Alliance, nor being taken in and stored in\nTreasury vaults. There was jade missing from the national reserves.\nDespite the fact that she had never intended to get involved in the clan’s\naffairs, Shae was shaky with triumph and outrage as she packed up her\nfindings and left the building. Her steps echoed down the empty halls as she\ntook the stairs down to the ground floor and asked one of the security guards\nto let her out of the locked doors. The guard was a bored, middle-aged Green\nBone wearing the ceremonial flat green cap and distinctive sash that marked\nhim as a member of Haedo Shield, a minor clan dedicated to the sole purpose\nof providing security for Prince Ioan III and the royal family, as well as\ngovernment buildings including Wisdom Hall and the Kekon Treasury.\nKnowing that she would not be returning the following evening, Shae\nthanked the night guard as she left. She was not worried about the man\ntipping off anyone about her activities. The members of Haedo Shield swore\nironclad oaths of neutrality with respect to the other clans; they did not even\nhold votes in the Kekon Jade Alliance.\nIt was a short subway ride from the Monument District to North Sotto, but\nas the trains ran less frequently at this hour, it was forty minutes later by the\ntime Shae was walking the few blocks from the subway station to her\napartment building. She was so engrossed in her thoughts, in what she would\nsay to Lan in the morning, that she was only a hundred meters from home\nbefore she realized she was being followed.\nShe was so stunned and mortified with herself that she simply stopped in\nher tracks and turned around. If she’d been wearing jade, she would’ve\nPerceived the man behind her long ago. Even jadeless, if she’d been paying\nattention, she ought to have sensed his footsteps trailing hers.\nShae dropped her bag unceremoniously to the sidewalk and drew the talon\nknife from the sheath strapped to the small of her back. It was not a jade-\nhilted knife like the one she’d carried for years but had stored away. This was\njust a plain, everyday sort of street weapon, but of good quality and certainly\nlethal enough in trained hands. She’d been raised in a culture that deemed it\nunthinkable not to respond to a challenge; it did not occur to Shae that she\ncould run less than thirty seconds to the safety of her apartment building.\nThe man coming up behind her did not stop, nor did he rush at her. He\nkept pace but took his hands out of his pockets and opened them to show that\nhe meant no harm. In another instant, Shae saw it was Caun Yu, her"

He nodded toward her respectfully, amiably, his eyes dropping to\nher weapon and noting that she held it in a steady, practiced grip, her stance\ninstinctive, coiled and evenly weighted across the soles of her feet. “You look\nlike a Green Bone,” he said with a crooked smile.\n“You were following me,” Shae said, defensive.\n“I live in the same building.”\n“What are you doing coming back so late?”\nCaun looked incredulous. “I work in the evenings. What about you?”\nShae’s toes curled inside her shoes. Of course, it was none of her business\nwhat hours Caun kept. She’d been disappointed in herself and was taking it\nout on someone who didn’t deserve her ire. She stowed her talon knife and\npicked up her fallen bag. “I apologize, that was rude of me. You caught me\noff guard. Shall we walk back, then?”\nHe nodded and walked alongside her, keeping some distance between\nthem. “You seem very much on guard to me, Miss Shae. If I’d actually been\na man with bad intentions, I wouldn’t have wanted to face you with that talon\nknife.”\nShae wanted to change the subject. “So what do you do for work, Mr.\nCaun?”\n“I’m a security guard,” he said. “It’s nothing very dangerous. Rather\nboring, to be honest. I’m hoping I’ll get a new job soon, something more\ninteresting.” He opened the door for her, and they climbed the stairs to their\napartments on the third floor. He did not ask her a question in return, but\nwhen they reached Shae’s apartment door, Caun paused and said, with a flash\nof teasing in his eyes, “Good night. From now on, I’ll be sure to call out hello\nto you when I’m still well out of knife range.” As Caun continued down the\nhall to his apartment, Shae sorely missed having the sense of Perception that\nmight’ve given her a hint as to what the man was thinking.\nShae put Caun out of her mind, went to sleep, and called the Kaul house\nas soon as she awoke in the morning, when the sun was barely up yet. Doru\nanswered the phone. “Shae-se,” he said, with false, mincing surprise. “Why\nhaven’t I seen you? I thought you would be at home more often.”\nShae grimaced. “I’ve been busy, Doru-jen. Getting settled. Lots of little\nthings to take care of, you know.”\n“You should have come to me,” he said. “Why are you living in that\nplace, anyway? I could have gotten you somewhere nicer, much nicer.”\n“I didn’t want to trouble you.” The fact that he knew where she lived\nmade her grimace stretch further. Hastily, she asked, “Is Lan home?”\n“Ah,” said Doru. A long pause followed, one that began to ring alarm\nbells in her head. “There’s been trouble, I’m afraid. Perhaps you ought to\ncome over.”\nShae hailed a taxi to take her straight to the Kaul home. It crawled"

It crawled\ninfuriatingly slowly through morning traffic, fighting the crush of honking\ncars, motorcycles, and parcel-laden bicycles, all of which employed a\nsurvival-of-the-fittest approach to intersections and road sign compliance.\nThe whole way there, Shae stared unseeing out the window. She felt sick at\nheart. Not because men had tried to kill her brother Hilo. That was hardly\nshocking to her; if anything she was surprised it didn’t happen more often.\nYet no one had phoned to tell her. Not even Lan. Had she not called the\nhouse this morning, she would still be oblivious. Perhaps in all the\ncommotion last night it simply hadn’t occurred to them to contact her. She’d\nbeen out of the country and out of touch for years. Perhaps she shouldn’t be\nso upset that she hadn’t been informed right away.\nShe arrived to find her brothers in a council of war. Armed and severe-\nlooking Fists were everywhere, guarding the gate and the entrance to the\nhouse, prowling the property, and standing in the hallways. In the Pillar’s\nstudy, Lan and Hilo were smoking grimly and plotting. Doru was with them.\nWhen Shae walked in, their postures told her everything: Lan leaned against\nhis desk, tapping ashes into a tray, his face stiff and drawn. Hilo was sitting\nforward on the edge of one armchair, elbows on knees, staring at nothing,\ncigarette dangling from the fingers of one hand. Doru rested back in the other\nchair, legs crossed, subtly apart, watching. The tension in the room was such\nthat Shae’s indignation failed her, driven out by an implacable sense of\napprehension.\nHilo raised his eyes when she came into the study. There were lines on his\nface that made him look like a different person, not his usual insouciant self.\nShae noticed dried blood under his nails, and beneath a white shirt that she\nsuspected was actually Lan’s, gauze bandages encircled his midsection. “Tar\nis in the hospital,” he said, as if she’d been standing there the whole time.\nShae was not even sure which one Tar was, whether he was the man she’d\nseen with Hilo in the hotel. “Will he be all right?” she asked, because that\nseemed to be the appropriate thing to say.\n“He’ll live. Wen is over there with him.” Hilo got up and circled\nrestlessly, like a dog unable to lie down. The door opened and Maik Kehn\nthrust his head into the room. He wasn’t the one she’d seen at the hotel; that\nmust’ve been Tar, then, the one now in the hospital. “Everyone’s here,” Kehn\nsaid. “We’re ready to go.”\n“Lan-se,” Doru spoke up. “I’ll ask you again to reconsider. This could go\nbadly for us. We can still negotiate a truce in the Armpit.”\n“No, Doru,” Lan said, stubbing out his cigarette in the ashtray and\nwalking to the door with Hilo. “Not anymore.” From the angle of the men’s"

Lan no longer trusted\nhim. The attempted murder of Hilo had pushed the Pillar too far, sided him\nwith his brother. Doru must have known it as well because there was a\ndeceptive impassiveness to his face, and he did not move from his spot in the\nchair as the other two men left.\nShae followed her brothers. The foyer of the house was filled with Hilo’s\nmen, armed to the teeth with moon blades, talon knives, and pistols. As Hilo\nwalked into their midst, they coalesced around him. He did not speak, but\nseemed, somehow, to acknowledge each of them, with a held glance, a nod, a\ntouch on the shoulder or arm.\nShae went to Lan. “Where are you going?”\n“To the Factory.” He shrugged on a leather vest and tightened it. Someone\nbrought him his best moon blade—a thirty-four-inch Da Tanori with a\ntwenty-two-inch tempered white carbon steel blade and five jade stones in the\nhilt. He strapped it to his waist. It had been some time since Shae had seen\nhim look so military, so much like their father, that the effect was\ndisorienting. Lan said, “That’s where they are, the men who tried to kill Hilo.\nGont is there as well, and Ayt too, perhaps.”\nThe realization hit her squarely: They were leaving to do battle. Shae\ngripped her brother by the arm. “What can I do to help?”\nLan looked at her and she realized how ridiculous her question was. She\ncouldn’t help, not in this, not now, not jadeless as she was. “Nothing,” Lan\nsaid. “Don’t let Doru take over the clan.” If he was killed.\n“I found out more,” she said, almost desperate to delay his departure. “At\nthe Treasury. I didn’t want to say anything in the room with Doru there, but I\nneed to talk to you.”\n“When I get back.” He gave her a quick kiss on the forehead.\n“Why didn’t you phone me last night?”\n“There was no need. You don’t have to be part of this,” he said. “I\npromised not to pull you in any further beyond what I’ve asked of you so far,\nwhich I know is already more than you wanted.” He looked over her shoulder\nand his face tightened.\nShae turned. Kaul Sen stood on the stairs like a baleful mummy, wearing\na white robe that hung off his scrawny frame. His fierce gaze roamed the\nassembled fighters and alighted with blistering disdain on Hilo. He pointed at\nhis youngest grandson, leaning into the gesture as if his bony finger were a\nweapon. “Your fault,” the old man snapped. “What’ve you done now? You\nwere always nothing but an impulsive hooligan. You’re going to ruin this\nfamily!”\n“Grandda,” Lan said warningly.\nHilo stepped forward through his pack of warriors. “They tried to kill me,\nGrandda.” His voice was soft, but Shae knew that Hilo spoke softly when he"

It’s war now.”\n“Ayt would not go to war with me!” Kaul Sen’s arms shook as he gripped\nthe banister. “We were like brothers. We had our differences, but war, war\nbetween Green Bones! No, never. If anyone tried to kill you, you deserved\nit!”\nHilo’s eyes flashed fire and hurt. Then he turned away, scorn flowing\nfrom him like a cape. “Let’s go.” His fighters flanked him as he stalked\nthrough the door and out of the house. They piled into the line of cars parked\nin the roundabout.\nKaul Sen sagged and sat down on the stairs, his limbs folding like a\nrickety chair frame, his robe draping over his bony shoulders and knees like a\nsheet.\n“Kyanla,” Lan called. “Help Grandda back to his room.” He put a hand on\nShae’s back and said in a low voice, “Stay with him.”\nShae nodded, trying to think of something more to say, such as, “Be\ncareful,” or “Good luck,” or “Please come back,” but none of them seemed to\nbe right, and Lan was already leaving, going down the steps of the front walk,\nclimbing into an open car door that one of the clan’s Fists held open for him.\nCHAPTER\n20\nClean Blades at the Factory\nT\nhe Factory was an old manufacturing facility just across the territorial\nborder, in the Mountain-controlled Spearpoint district. The building still read\nKEKON SPECIAL TEXTILE CO. in large faded paint on the outside wall, but it had\nbeen converted years ago into a gathering place and training hall for\nMountain Green Bones. According to the No Peak Fingers and Lantern Men\nwho’d called in overnight and early this morning, the two surviving assassins,\nGam Oben and Chon Daal, had been seen fleeing the Armpit on foot and\ncoming here.\nThey arrived in a convoy just before noon, six cars packed with No Peak\nfighters. They parked in front of the Factory and piled out in a storm of\nslamming doors and glinting weapons. Lan and Hilo stood together at the\nfront, conferring. The brick building was tall and the windows were covered;\nit was impossible to tell how many Mountain Green Bones were waiting\ninside. Hilo pointed out the sentries watching them from the roof. So far, no\none had come out of the building.\n“Send in a message,” Lan said.\nHilo motioned forward one of the Fingers, a young man with hair hanging\nlonger on one side and two jade piercings in his lower lip. The fighter\ndropped to his knees and touched his head to the ground. “I am ready to die\nfor the clan, Kaul-jens.”\nHilo gave him his instructions, and the Finger was sent, unarmed, up to\nthe front door of the Factory. The demand was simple: hand over the heads of\nthe two men responsible for the attack on Hilo and cede control of the Armpit\ndistrict, or No Peak would come down from the forest. “Coming down from"

The Kauls\nwatched as the messenger was met by two guards. Words were exchanged,\nand the man was admitted into the building.\nHilo sat down on the hood of the Duchesse to wait. Lan leaned against the\ndoor of his Roewolfe roadster and watched the front of the building with taut\nnerves and a parched feeling in his mouth. It was one of those days when sun\nand cloud grappled with each other in the sky, and the waiting men were\nbathed in alternating patches of heat and shadow, as if the weather itself was\nunsure of how the day would proceed. Since the moment Mrs. Sugo had\ninterrupted him in the Lilac Divine the night before, it was as if he’d been\nswept along by a tsunami. He felt as if he had little control over its direction\nand was battling merely to ride near the surface of it.\nLan did not want a clan war. It would be bad for everyone—for Green\nBones, for business, for the people, for the country itself. All this time, he’d\nbelieved that so long as he treaded carefully, he could avoid outright conflict\nwith the Mountain. He’d ignored Ayt’s disrespect, politely rejected her\nforceful overtures to form an alliance, and taken reasonable steps to secure\nthe KJA and safeguard his own clan’s position. Now he saw that his actions\nwere the defensive maneuverings of a dumb bull being set upon by a leopard.\nThey had only emboldened the enemy, sent the impression that the Pillar of\nNo Peak was soft, not someone to be feared.\nHe’d been a fool. He’d known that the Mountain wanted Hilo out of the\nway, but he hadn’t anticipated that the enemy Pillar would act so quickly and\nwith such violence. Was it because his rival was a woman that he’d assumed\nshe would hesitate to shed blood first? If so, it had been a near fatal oversight\non his part. Now Ayt had whispered the name of the second son of No Peak.\nNo matter any other business or territorial considerations between the clans,\nthat was not something that could be negotiated away. The Kaul family name\ncould not command any authority or respect unless it answered such an\noffense unequivocally.\nA mile-long freight train passed a short distance away, blaring its\napproach and rumbling on and on over the rails, hauling goods from across\nthe island into the port stations in Summer Park and the Docks. A breeze\nskimmed westward off the water. Half an hour passed. The Factory remained\nsilent and inscrutable. The No Peak men grumbled and paced and smoked.\nMaik Kehn came up. “They’re not answering. They’ve probably killed him\nby now.” Maik’s face was creased with impatience and murderous drive.\n“What are we going to do if they don’t answer?”\nHilo said, “We’re going to storm the fucking place and drag Gont Asch\nout by his tiny balls.” This satisfied his lieutenant, who grunted in agreement,"

He spread his arms wide and turned in an arrogant circle. “I’m still\nalive! Don’t send your puppies to kill me. Come out and do it yourself, you\ndogfucking coward!”\nBehind him, the Fists roared their assent and pounded on the cars.\nAt that moment, an understanding struck Lan clearly and heavily: The\nMountain had sent men to kill Hilo, not him—not Lan, the firstborn, the\nPillar. It was Hilo that the enemy viewed as a threat, Hilo who was ferocious\nand violent and could lead Fists in war. Now he’d survived an assassination\nattempt and gained for it.\nLan knew what that said about him in turn: He was Pillar on account of\nbirth, and Kaul Sen’s decree, and a face that reminded people of his father.\nHe strived at all times to be a strong and prudent leader, to maintain peace, to\nrespect the legacy of his grandfather, and while those things gave him respect\nand credibility within the clan, they did not intimidate or dissuade rivals. The\nenemy had struck first, not at the clan’s political head but at its top warrior,\nand in so doing, dispelled any doubt that the Mountain intended to move in\non No Peak and conquer it by force.\nHe was, by nature, a man slow to anger, but Kaul Lan’s hands curled into\nfists, and a churning pool of shame and rage rose in him like a cloudy tide.\nThe door of the Factory opened and three men emerged. Lan and Maik\nKehn walked up together to join Hilo, who stood his ground and faced the\napproaching men. First came the young No Peak messenger. He hurried\nforward and dropped to his knees once again, looking almost apologetic to\nstill be very much alive. “Kaul-jens, I regret the dogs didn’t give me a chance\nto die for No Peak. But they sent me back out with these two.”\nBehind him came two Mountain Green Bones. “That’s them,” Hilo said to\nLan. “The limping one is Chon. The dark one’s Gam.”\nThe two sides regarded each other with hesitant mutual hatred. Chon, a\nmidrank Finger, was injured and scared. Sweat slicked his bruised face, and\nhe could only glance at the No Peak fighters for a few seconds before shifting\nhis eyes. Gam was greener in both body and spirit; jade hung around his\nneck, studded his nose, encircled his wrists. He looked directly at Lan and\nspoke first.\n“My Pillar agrees to your demands,” Gam said. “She approved the attack\non your Horn out of a sense of great insult for his many transgressions\nagainst our clan, but realizes she may have acted in anger and haste. So, to\nshow her willingness to negotiate, we will withdraw from the Armpit except\nfor the small section south of Patriot Street that we have always controlled.”\n“How generous,” Hilo scoffed, “but that’s not all we demanded.”"

This one here,” he jerked his head at\nChon, “isn’t worthy of a warrior’s end, but my clan and my honor demand\nthat I die befitting my rank, like a proper Fist of the Mountain. Kaul\nLanshinwan, Pillar of No Peak, I offer you a clean blade.”\nLan was honestly stunned. Then his eyes narrowed. “I accept.”\nThe No Peak men had gathered around to hear the conversation, and now\nall of them stepped back at once, clearing a large circle of space. All except\nHilo. He angled his body in front of Lan and lowered his voice. “Gam\ndeserves an execution, not a duel,” the Horn said. “This is some kind of\ntrick.”\n“You’ll be here watching to see if it is,” Lan said. “But I don’t think so.”\nHe didn’t elaborate on how he was certain this was Ayt’s belated way of\nmeasuring him. She already knew something of Hilo. She’d tried to have him\nkilled, and failed. Now she wanted to know if Lan was as weak as she’d\ntaken him for. The knowledge would determine her next move; it was\napparently worth surrendering most of the Armpit. If the Pillar of No Peak\nbacked down, he would lose face in front of the enemy and his own Green\nBones.\n“A death of consequence, then,” Hilo suggested. “Kehn and I would do\nit.”\nLan answered him with a scalding look, and the Horn fell silent. What sort\nof Green Bone would Lan be, to send his injured younger brother to fight\nGam a second time instead of answering a direct challenge himself? He\nunderstood without a doubt that, like it or not, he was to be a wartime Pillar\nnow, and the most unwise thing he could do was to continue elevating Hilo’s\nbattle prowess over his own in front of the clan’s Fists and the enemy’s eyes.\nSo it had to be this way, the Green Bone way. If force was the only\nlanguage Ayt understood, then he would have to speak clearly.\nGam retreated several paces. “Knife or blade?”\nIt was the prerogative of the one who’d been challenged to choose the\nweapon. Hilo favored the talon knife—compact, vicious, always within reach\n—but Lan was not a street fighter, and the formality and elegance of the\nmoon blade seemed more appropriate. “Blade,” he said.\nHilo was still skeptical. “You expect me to honor this?”\nThe offer of a clean blade was an ironclad pledge. The victor took the\nloser’s life and jade without consequence—no relative or ally would seek\nretribution. Hilo’s question was rhetorical, and Lan looked at him askance.\n“You’re worried I might lose?”\nHilo turned his chin slightly to glance at Gam. He brought his eyes back\nand spoke in an undertone. “He’s not trivial.”\n“Neither am I.” Lan said it more sharply than he’d intended."

He brought his eyes back\nand spoke in an undertone. “He’s not trivial.”\n“Neither am I.” Lan said it more sharply than he’d intended.\n“I have a dozen Fists here who’d fight Gam in your name. You’re the\nPillar.”\n“If I can’t do this, I can’t be Pillar.” Lan’s reply was curt, pitched low so\nthat only Hilo could hear, but nevertheless, he’d admitted out loud what\nothers surely believed but left unsaid: that the son of the great Kaul Du\nneeded to prove how green he truly was.\nLan drew his Da Tanori moon blade from its sheath and held it out to his\nbrother, who spat on the white metal for good luck, though he didn’t smile.\n“He has good offensive Deflection,” Hilo said. “Better to fight him from\nclose in.” He squeezed Lan between his shoulder and neck, then retreated to\nstand beside Kehn. A nameless pang touched Lan in the chest; he ought to\nsay something else to Hilo, just in case, but doing so seemed as if it would be\nbad luck.\nLan was not devoutly religious, but he sent up a silent prayer to Jenshu the\nMonk, the One Who Returned, the patron of jade warriors. Old Uncle in\nHeaven, judge me the greener of your kin today, if it be so. Then he turned\nand faced Gam and touched the flat of his blade to his forehead in salute. The\nother man returned the gesture. They circled each other. The sky had abruptly\ncleared and the sunlight beat stark on the pavement. The embedded stones\nseemed to pulse under Lan’s palm, layering jade energy into him, stretching\nhis clarity, changing the way space and time moved. Seconds lengthened,\ndistances shortened. Gam’s heartbeat throbbed in the center of his Perception.\nHe sensed the man’s jade aura shifting, testing, expanding and contracting,\nsubtly judging when and how to attack.\nFor a terrible second, doubt rushed in. Lan had once been at the top of the\nAcademy and won his fair share of violent contests, but it had been years\nsince he had dueled. Gam Oben had been groomed by Gont Asch and had\ngreater and more recent experience as a fighter. Perhaps Ayt was gambling\nintelligently. He might lose to this man, might doom his clan.\nPerceiving Lan’s instant of uncertainty, Gam chose that moment to attack.\nHe stepped into a classic opening high sweep cut, then changed his direction\ndeftly and sliced low. Lan caught the misdirection in time and deflected the\nblade; he circled his own weapon around in an upward piercing strike. Gam\ntwisted away, throwing his arm up against the side of his head; Lan’s blade\nsheared against his Steeled arm.\nLan launched into an offensive flurry of quick cuts. Their blades sang\ntogether in a lethal duet. Blocking and deflecting, Gam gave ground, then\npivoted sharply and slammed a kick into the Pillar’s side. Lan felt his ribs\ncompress and heave under the man’s Strength. He pulled himself Light and\nflew back, landing on his feet.

The watching men hurried backward to make\nmore space.\nOut of range now to reach his opponent with the blade, Lan remembered\nHilo’s warning just as Gam flung his left arm forward with a shout and a\nheaving burst of jade energy, ripping a wave of Deflection through the air\nstrong enough to hurl a grown man to the ground. Lan rooted into a forward\nstance and threw up his own Deflection in a vertical shield that parted the\nother Green Bone’s attack like the prow of a boat. He felt the clash of energy\nreverberate through his frame, clattering his clenched teeth as he skidded\nbackward into his planted heel.\nLike the suck of a receding tide, he felt Gam pull his aura in, readying\nanother spear of Deflection. Lan rushed his opponent, Lightness and Strength\nturning him into a blur of speed. His moon blade carved a deadly path toward\nthe side of Gam’s neck. The other Green Bone whirled under the slice and\nslammed a palm strike to Lan’s sternum.\nAll the energy the Fist had gathered for the Deflection, he Channeled into\nthe blow. Lan gave every fiber of his being into Steel, knowing in that instant\nhe would live or die based on whether the other man’s force could break him.\nEverything dimmed; he felt Gam’s energy batter and buckle him. It\npierced his rib cage and seized his heart. Lan felt death tickle the edge of his\nmind. His Steel splintered, but it did not break. It held in a moment of\nstalemate, and then it roared outward, scattering the force of the killing blow.\nHe was, after all, a Kaul.\nGam had given all of himself to the attempt. He swayed on his feet for an\ninstant, his jade aura wafting pale and flimsy. Lan sunk his blade into the\nman’s side like it was a block of soft bean curd. He had almost nothing left\neither, but he pulled across, parting tissue and arteries. His Perception\nclamored white as if drowning in psychic noise—the final spike of pain and\nfear from Gam, the backwash of energy as the man’s life fled him, the\nmultitudinous rush of triumph and elation from the watching warriors of No\nPeak—and then the Second Fist of the Mountain slumped to the ground.\nLan fell to his knees, gasping. “Thank you, Old Uncle Jenshu, for your\nfavor,” he whispered. Then, raising his voice so all could hear, he spoke to\nhis opponent’s body. “You carried your jade well, and you died a Fist’s\ndeath. You were a worthy opponent, Gam, a loss to your Horn.” He wiped\nboth sides of his moon blade down the inside sleeve of his left arm, and\nraising it high, rose to his feet. “My blade is clean.”\nFrom the sidelines, Kaul Hilo gave a curt nod to Maik Kehn. The Fist\nstepped around Chon Daal, who knelt in resignation of his fate. Maik pulled\nthe man’s head back and opened his throat from ear to ear with a deep, swift\nstroke of a talon knife, then pushed him face forward onto the asphalt.\n“No Peak! No Peak!” the Green Bones erupted in chorus. “Kaul Lan-jen!"

No Peak!” the Green Bones erupted in chorus. “Kaul Lan-jen!\nOur blood for the Pillar!” They dropped to their knees and beat their fists on\nthe ground in a drumbeat of applause, their exuberant, pent-up Strength\ndenting the pavement. Lan cut off his enemy’s jade chokers and bracelets and\ntore the studs from his face. So much jade in his hand made his throat feel dry\nwith heat and his scalp tingle as if the roots of his hair were charged with\nelectricity. He was moving as if in a dream, dizzy with relief.\nHe stood. “We’re leaving,” he shouted. “But let our enemies know this:\nNo Peak defends and avenges our own. You wrong any one of us, you wrong\nus all. You seek to war with us, and we will return it a hundredfold. No one\nwill take from us what is ours!” Lan thrust the fistful of jade he’d won above\nhis head and the din increased. He saw Hilo cross his arms and rock back on\nhis heels, smiling.\nThe Green Bones piled back into the cars. Their bloodthirst, if not fully\nquenched, had been sated by the outcome of the duel. Lan allowed himself\nthe grim satisfaction of seeing the clan’s warriors hailing him, as he knew\nthey hailed Hilo. To anyone watching, the fight had seemed quick and\ndecisive. The Mountain would not retaliate over the kills. No Peak had not\nlost any lives, and the Armpit was now almost entirely theirs. It was a\nvictory. Wasn’t it?\nLan walked past his own silver roadster and pulled open the back door of\nthe Duchesse instead. Sitting alone in the wide back seat, he let the jade he’d\ntaken drop next to him. He unstrapped his moon blade and rested it on the\nfloor across his feet. He ached. The jade around his arms and waist seemed\nunusually heavy, and he felt injured, somewhere deep inside. He wondered if\nanyone else had noticed how close the fight had been.\nHilo got into the front passenger seat. Once Maik Kehn had pulled the car\nonto the freeway and they were speeding back through the city, Hilo twisted\naround and offered his brother a cigarette, then lit it for him. He turned to\nface the front again and rolled the window down halfway. “Must hurt like a\nbitch,” he said quietly. “Lie down, Lan.

No longer the Torch of Kekon.\nKyanla brought Kaul Sen a bowl of cut-up fruit on a tray and fussed over\nhis blanket and cushions, making him more comfortable in his chair by the\nwindow. He swatted her away and turned clear but weary eyes on Shae.\n“Why don’t you come live at home? What have you been doing all this\ntime?” Shae tensed, but her grandfather’s questions were less angry than\nperplexed. Sad. “You want to live in Janloon but not be with your family?\nAre you seeing another man? Another foreigner you don’t want to bring\nhome?”\n“No, Grandda,” Shae said, irked now.\n“Your brother needs you,” he insisted. “You should help him.”\n“They don’t need my help,” Shae told him.\n“What is wrong with you? You don’t know who you are anymore,” Kaul\nSen declared. “I used to say you were my best grandson. You remember\nthat?”\nShae did not answer him.\nShe tried not to keep watching the front drive the way one might watch a\npot of water on the stove. She realized with dull despair that she’d become\nwhat she’d sworn she’d never be—a woman like her mother, sitting at home\nworrying while the men went off to meet danger and mete out violence. Her\nyounger self would be disgusted. She was a daughter of Kaul Du, a\ngrandchild of Kaul Sen—indeed, his favorite. Growing up, the idea of being\nany less than her brothers had been anathema.\nSomewhere at the bottom of a drawer in her childhood bedroom, there\nwas a journal she’d kept as a teenager at the Academy. If she were to set it on\nits spine, it would fall open to a page with a vertical line drawn down the\ncenter, dividing it into two columns. On the top of one column was her name;\non the other was Hilo’s. For years she’d recorded every score and rank she\nreceived as an initiate. Without his knowledge, she did the same for Hilo. He\nwas more talented in some areas, but she practiced more consistently, studied\nharder, wanted it more. She graduated at the top of their class, despite being\nthe youngest in their cohort. Hilo came in sixth.\nShe’d been a more highly ranked Green Bone than her brother, and proud\nof it. It had taken her a few more years to realize how little it meant. The\ndemerits that had pulled down Hilo’s scores—reprimands for skipping class,\nsneaking off campus, instigating street fights—had won him the admiration\nand following of peers. The countless hours Shae had spent alone,\nobsessively studying or practicing, had isolated her from the other students,\nespecially the other women. Hilo had spent that time idling with the wide\nposse of friends who would become his most loyal Fingers and Fists.\nLooking back on it now, Shae could almost laugh at her teenage naïveté, her\nhopeless earnestness, her inevitable disappointment.\nOne day, Hilo had discovered her journal and the two-column page"

He’d laughed so hard tears came to his\neyes. He’d told his friends, and they’d teased her about it mercilessly. Shae\nhad been furious and humiliated by how amused he was, how utterly\nnonchalant he felt about her mission to best him. Her anger only baffled and\nentertained him further.\n“What’re you saving this for?” He’d waved it in front of her. “So you’re\nbetter than me at school, sure. Are you planning to lord it over me ten years\nfrom now?” He tossed it back to her, smiling, and this infuriated her further\n—how he didn’t even bother to take it away or rip it up. “What do you need\nto try so hard for all the time, Shae? Lan will be Pillar someday; I’ll be the\nHorn, and you’ll be Weather Man. Who’s going to care about our grades\nthen?”\nIt had almost turned out that way. Lan was Pillar now; Hilo was the Horn.\nShe was the one who’d ruined the triumvirate. She was the broken piece. Hilo\nhad been so furious when she’d left, not because he hated Espenians, or\nJerald, or even the things she’d done and the secrets she’d kept. It was her\nrefusal to fall into proper place in his vision of the world that had enraged\nhim. In the hotel, he claimed he’d forgiven her, but she found that difficult to\nbelieve.\nShe tried to interest her grandfather in the bowl of fruit, but he wouldn’t\nhave it, so she ate it herself. “The war was an easier time,” Kaul Sen muttered\nall of a sudden. “The Shotarians were cruel, but we could resist them. These\ndays? Espenians buy everything—our jade, our grandchildren. Green Bones\nfight each other in the streets like dogs!” His face twisted as if in pain. “I\ndon’t want to live in this world anymore.”\nShae squeezed her grandfather’s hand. He might be an old tyrant, but it\ndisturbed her to hear him talk like this. She tugged on her right earlobe,\nremembering that Jerald had always teased her for the superstitious Kekonese\nhabit. “Don’t say that, Grandda.” She glanced back out the window and stood\nup so quickly she nearly knocked over her grandfather’s tray. The gates were\nopening. Cars were driving through and parking in the roundabout.\nShae called for Kyanla and hurried down the stairs. Her brothers were\nwalking through the front door together. Relief swept over her, weakened her\nknees; she put a hand on the banister to steady herself. Lan gave her a smile\nthat looked thin around the edges. “Don’t look like that. I told you we’d be\nback, didn’t I?”\nHilo said, “You missed all the fun, Shae.” He threw a proud arm over\nLan’s shoulders and called back to his First Fist. “Kehn, get these guys\nsorted. I need some time for family talk. Don’t let anyone else in.”\nThey went back into Lan’s study and shut the door. “What about"

Don’t let anyone else in.”\nThey went back into Lan’s study and shut the door. “What about\nGrandda?” Shae asked. “And Doru?”\n“They can wait,” Lan said.\nShae was astounded; to her recollection, Lan had always included Kaul\nSen and Doru in the clan decisions. Shutting out the patriarch and the\nWeather Man was an affront. It sent the unmistakable message that the winds\nin the clan had shifted dramatically.\nMore disturbing—she was in here. Her brothers had included her, even\nthough she wasn’t wearing jade. People might begin to think she was\nreplacing Doru. She didn’t want that at all, but she couldn’t leave now. Even\nas she told herself she ought not to be in here, she sat down in one of the\nleather armchairs. Lan lowered himself gingerly into the one across from her,\nand she realized he was hurt. He wasn’t bleeding, but he looked pale and\ndrained, fragile in a way she’d never imagined her older brother could appear.\n“Lan,” she said, “you need a doctor.”\n“Later,” he said. Shae noticed his left hand moving, rolling beads of jade\nin his palm—new jade, she realized. Jade he’d won.\n“What happened?” she asked.\n“We sent two of theirs to the grave.” Hilo remained standing. He was still\narmed to the teeth and hadn’t relaxed. “Lan took one of their best Fists with a\nclean blade, and we executed the other. The Armpit’s ours.”\nShae said, “You’re not smiling.” Walking through the door ahead of his\nmen, Hilo had been grinning and triumphant. Alone with Lan and Shae, he\nwore a scowl.\n“This is just the opening move,” Lan said. “They’ll try again.”\nHilo paced a short line in front of Lan’s neatly ordered bookshelves. “Ayt\nhad men ambush me last night. Gont sent out his Fist to challenge Lan today.\nThe Mountain’s shown they can hit us hard at the top and not even show their\nfaces. We might look like we’re ahead for now, but they came too close.\nThey hurt us. People will talk, and it’ll be bad for us.”\nShae said, “You killed four of their men.”\n“Ten Fists don’t matter next to the Pillar,” Hilo said.\nLan shifted his attention to Shae. He seemed to be trying to move as little\nas necessary. “Tell us what you found out. From the Treasury.”\nInvoluntarily, Shae glanced around the room, almost expecting to see\nDoru hovering in the corner. “I told you about the new equipment that Gont\nAsch signed for. Well, it’s being put to use. Production at the mines is up\nfifteen percent this year, the biggest increase in a decade,” she said. “So I\nwondered, where is the extra jade going? I examined KJA financial\nstatements and there’s no accounting for the increase. Foreign sales haven’t\nincreased; you told me yourself the vote to raise the export quota didn’t pass.\nAllocation to the martial schools, temples, and licensed users is only up six\npercent. That leaves an awful lot of jade that’s been mined but not\ndistributed.”"

There’s no increase in jade inventory that matches\nthe growth in production. Somewhere between the mines and the vault, jade\nis going missing.”\n“How’s that possible?” Lan asked. “The Weather Man’s office audits—”\nHe stopped himself. His back teeth came together, flexing his jawline.\n“Doru.” Hilo spat the Weather Man’s name. His head swung toward the\nclosed door. “He’s in on it. The Mountain is producing extra jade and\nsmuggling it away under our noses, hoodwinking all the other clans in the\nKJA and the Royal Council too. That ball-less old ferret has been covering\nfor Ayt and keeping us in the dark.”\nA shadow fell heavily across Lan’s face. “Doru has always been loyal to\nthe family. He’s been like an uncle to us since we were children. I can’t\nbelieve he would betray us to the Mountain.”\n“It’s possible he doesn’t know about the discrepancies,” Shae suggested.\n“Someone under him could be tampering with the reports that he sees.”\n“You believe that?” Hilo asked.\nShae hesitated to answer. As repulsive as she found Doru, she had to\nagree with Lan that it was difficult to imagine the veteran Weather Man ever\nundermining the clan. When it came to war and business, her grandfather had\ntrusted him absolutely for decades. How could the Torch himself have been\nsuch a poor judge of character? “I don’t know,” Shae said. “But he has to go.\nIf he’s not a traitor, then he’s a negligent Weather Man.”\nLan exchanged a glance with Hilo. “We’ll find out which it is. We keep\nthis to ourselves for now.” He turned back to Shae. “You’re certain you have\nproof of everything you’ve said?”\n“Yes,” Shae said.\n“Document all of it and send three copies of your findings to Woon\nPapidonwa by tomorrow. Woon and no one else.” Lan paused. “Thank you,\nShae. I appreciate what you’ve done, finding this out for us. I hope it didn’t\ninconvenience you too much. I’m sorry if it did.”\nThat was it. As quickly as they’d brought her in, she was being shown out.\n“It wasn’t a burden,” she managed to reply. Weeks of traveling, sitting in the\nTreasury’s records room, combing through files, studying ledgers and reports\nuntil her eyes ached and it was dark outside. She could feel the weight of\nHilo’s stare following her as she stood up and went to the door.\n“Shae,” Lan said. She paused with a hand on the door, and he said in a\ngentler voice, “Come for dinner at the house sometimes. Whenever you want.\nNo need to call ahead.”\nShae nodded without turning, then let herself out. The heavy door clicked\nshut behind her.

Someone with little enough jade that he won’t notice. You\nhave a nose in the Weather Man’s office?” When Hilo nodded, Lan said, “I\nwant to know if he’s had any contact with the Mountain. If he’s really a\ntraitor.”\n“Seems we could bring him in here and find out pretty quick right now.”\nLan shook his head. “What if we’re wrong? Then again, what if we’re\nright? Doru is like a brother to Grandda. He’s the only one Grandda has left\nfrom his glory days. You haven’t seen them together every morning, those\ntwo. I have; they still drink their tea and play circle chess under the cherry\ntree in the courtyard, like an old married couple. It would kill the old man to\nsee Doru accused of treason.” Lan closed his eyes for a moment, then opened\nthem again. “No,” he said. “We have to know for sure, and if it’s true, we\nhave to handle it quietly, so Grandda never knows.”\n“Doru will suspect we’re on to him,” Hilo said, “and everyone else will\nask questions. How are you going to explain the fact that we shut him out just\nnow?”\n“I’ll smooth it over,” Lan said. “I’ll say we were talking privately with\nShae, brother to sister, trying to convince her to come back into the clan.”\nHilo sat down finally, in the seat Shae had vacated. Lan had to edge back\nin his own chair slightly. With new jade in his hand and in his pocket, Hilo’s\naura seemed too bright in his mind.\n“What about Shae?” Hilo asked.\n“What about her?”\n“You told me not to push her. You said we’re to leave her alone and let\nher walk around embarrassing herself with no jade on, if that’s what she\nwants to do.”\n“That’s right,” said Lan.\n“Then you send her to dig into clan business. You didn’t even tell me. If\nI’d known she was working for you, I would’ve been nicer to her.” Hilo tilted\nhis head. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m not disagreeing. But which is it? You\nwant her in or out?”\nLan exhaled slowly through his nose. “I wouldn’t have asked her to do\nanything for the clan, but I needed someone with a brain for numbers,\nsomeone not in Doru’s control, to follow my suspicions. Considering what\nshe found, I don’t regret it, but it doesn’t mean I’ve changed my mind.”\n“You’re going to need a new Weather Man soon,” Hilo pointed out."

I’m not going to guilt, order, or threaten her back into the clan. She\nespecially doesn’t need any pressure from you. She gets enough from\nGrandda as it is. Shae has an Espenian education now—something neither of\nus has—so she has other options in life that we don’t. Janloon’s not just for\nGreen Bones. You can choose to live without jade, an ordinary citizen with\nan ordinary life, like millions of other people.”\nHilo held his hands up. “All right.”\n“You’re not kids anymore. The two of you can make your own choices. I\ndon’t need to wipe bloody noses and tell you to show some respect to each\nother.”\n“I said all right.” A moment of silence passed before Hilo said, “Lan. I\ndidn’t notice until I was sitting closer to you, but your aura doesn’t seem\nright. It’s …” He squeezed his eyes shut and turned his face aside,\nconcentrating his Perception. “It’s flaring, pulsing, kind of. It feels off. Not\nlike you.”\n“It’s all the new jade,” Lan said. “It’s taking a little getting used to. You\nknow how it is.” He was sitting still, but his heart was beating fast.\nHilo opened his eyes. “I don’t think you should wear it.”\n“I won this jade.” Lan was startled by his sudden defensiveness. “It’s\nmine by right. You wear all the jade you’ve won, don’t you?”\nHis brother shrugged. “Sure.”\n“What did you take last night?”\nHilo leaned back and shifted his hip off the chair so he could reach into\nhis pockets and pull out his spoils. “The rings, bracelet, and pendant. I’ll get\nthem reset, obviously.” He held them out for Lan’s inspection. “The watch\nand these studs belong to the Maiks. There’s a belt in my car that’s theirs by\nright too.” He returned them to his pockets and sat back. “It’s not as much as\nGam’s.”\n“You still have more overall.” Lan blinked; had he just said that?\nHilo’s eyes widened, surprised as well. “Is that what this is about?” He\nran his tongue over his lips. “I’m the Horn, brother. People don’t expect me\nto be smart. They do expect me to carry a shitload of jade. Everyone’s\ndifferent.”\n“Some people are better. Thicker-blooded.” Lan wondered what was\nwrong with him, that he was sounding so bitter and testy. The fatigue from\nstaying up for more than thirty-six hours straight, the fight in front of the\nFactory, and now the jade—it was all getting to him. Too much, too quickly.\n“It’s been years since I’ve dueled, Hilo,” he said. “Ayt killed her father’s own\nHorn, and two of his Fists. Today I had to fight in front of our men, and I had\nto win. Tomorrow people will be paying attention, to see if I’m wearing the\nproof that I’m thick-blooded enough for No Peak to stand up to the Mountain"

You know better than anyone that it’s true.”\nHilo’s gaze was straight. “You’re right. It’s true.” He glanced down at the\ncarpet, lips pursed, then back up again. “You don’t have to do it right now,\nthough. After what Gam hit you with? You’re hurt. Put it down, Lan. Give\nyourself a break.” He got up and held his hand out, offering to take it.\nIn a surge of possessiveness, Lan’s fist tightened around the jade. His\njade; how dare his little brother think to take it from him? Hilo’s aura was too\nharsh and close, mentally blinding. He kept standing there, though, hand\nextended, and Lan Perceived no greed, only concern.\nIn a burst of clarity, he knew the jade was doing this: setting him on edge,\nskewing his emotions. He’d been taught the early warning signs of jade\noverexposure since he was a child—every Green Bone had. Severe mood\nswings, sensory distortion, shaking, sweating, fever, a racing heart, anxiety\nand paranoia. The appearance of symptoms could be sudden or gradual. They\nmight come and go for months or years, but were exacerbated by stress, poor\nhealth, or injury. If left unaddressed, they could progress into the Itches,\nwhich were almost always fatal.\nHilo was looking at him intently now. Lan forced himself to open his\nhand and set the jade studs on the side table. He removed the chokers from\nhis breast pocket and pushed all of Gam’s jade away from himself.\nA few seconds passed before the change kicked in, and then it was\ndramatic, as if a high fever had suddenly broken. His heart rate came down,\nthe painful sharpness of the room receded. Hilo’s aura returned to its usual\nsmooth hum. Lan took a slow, deep breath and let it out again, trying not to\nlet his relief appear too palpable. “Better?”\nHilo nodded and sat back down, but there was an uncertainty in his eyes\nthat Lan did not like. So even Hilo doubted his ability. Kaul Sen was a\ndecrepit old man, Doru might be a traitor, and Shae refused to even wear\njade. It was only him and Hilo now. What was happening to the great Kaul\nfamily?\n“You should go, Hilo,” he said. “We both have things we need to do.”\nHis brother did not move from the chair. “I have something else to ask\nyou,” he said. Lan had almost never seen his brother look nervous, but now\nHilo rubbed his hands together and cleared his throat. “I want to marry Wen.”\nLan tried not to sigh out loud. “Do we have to talk about this right now?”\n“Yes.” Hilo’s voice took on sudden urgency. “After last night, I don’t\nwant to waste time, Lan. I don’t want to be lying on the pavement bleeding\nout the last seconds of my life thinking I didn’t do everything I meant to.\nThat I didn’t give her this one thing when I had the chance.”\nLan’s head ached and he felt dehydrated.

        "text": "That I didn’t give her this one thing when I had the chance.”\nLan’s head ached and he felt dehydrated. The dramatic addition and then\nwithdrawal of jade made him feel as if his skull had been pulled out too far\nand then squeezed back down too tightly. He rubbed his brow. “You really\nlove her.”\nTo his surprise, Hilo looked insulted. “Why would I be asking\notherwise?”\nLan felt like telling him that love wasn’t enough, not when it came to\nmarriage. There was a time when he’d thought it would be enough. Eyni had\nthought so too. She’d known he would one day be Pillar; she’d assured him\nshe understood what that meant, that everything would work out fine in the\nend because they loved each other. He’d convinced her, and himself, that\ntaking on the leadership of No Peak wouldn’t change him, wouldn’t change\nthings between them. They’d been wrong, of course. Looking back, Lan\ncould see now that there’d been cracks beforehand, but the demands of the\nclan had shaken those cracks into impassable fissures.\nWarnings about the impermanence of love would not work on Hilo,\nthough. He was not the sort of person who would ever view something so\nimportant to him in such an abstracted fashion. “You know how I feel about\nWen,” Lan said. “She’s a lovely girl. She’s always been respectful to the\nclan, and I’d gladly treat her like my sister. But her family is beneath you.\nEveryone knows the Maiks were disgraced. A lot of people in No Peak still\nthink they can’t be trusted, and even if they don’t say it out loud, they assume\nWen is illegitimate.”\nHilo’s neck flushed and his face grew stiff. “All that happened years ago.\nYou shouldn’t blame the Maiks for their parents. I made Kehn and Tar my\nFirst and Second Fists—I wouldn’t have done that if I didn’t trust them with\nmy life. And I don’t care who Wen’s father really is. She’s of the No Peak\nclan as far as anyone is concerned, and she’s a good person—caring and\nloyal.”\n“I’m sure she is,” Lan said. “She’s also a stone-eye. There are always\ngoing to be people who see her as bad luck, or whisper she was born that way\nbecause she’s a bastard and a punishment to her parents. Don’t look so angry\nat me. I’m only telling you that the clan can have long and superstitious\nmemories. You’re the Horn; you have to think about that.”\n“I don’t care what anyone else in the clan thinks, it’s you I’m asking.”\nHilo sounded almost desperate. “You’re willing to forgive Shae completely\nand welcome her back, but you balk at accepting the Maiks?”\n“That’s different,” Lan said. “Shae is a Kaul no matter what. You’re\nmaking the decision to bind our family to a disreputable name, and to father\nchildren with a stone-eye wife.”\nHilo’s aura roiled with tension. “What can I say to convince you?” His\neyes fastened to Lan’s. “I swear I’ll never ask you for anything else.”\nSometimes it astounded Lan that his younger brother could be so different"

Shortsighted, yes, but fully committed. Passionate in a way that\nleft so little room for doubt. Lan said, “You’ve already made up your mind.\nI’ve said my concerns, but it’s your decision, Hilo. You don’t need my\npermission.”\n“Don’t say that,” Hilo snapped. “That’s a bullshit excuse.” He leaned so\nfar forward in his chair that he half rose from it. “You’re my older brother.\nYou’re the Pillar! When Grandda was Pillar, he didn’t let a leaf drop in the\ncourtyard without his permission. People came to him to approve their\nmarriages, their new businesses, the names of their kids and dogs, the color\nof their fucking wallpaper for all I know. Give me your blessing, or condemn\nme, but don’t wash your hands of me. It wouldn’t mean anything for me to\nmarry Wen without the approval of the Pillar. No one would take it\nseriously.”\nOn the other hand, if Lan endorsed the union, he would be publicly\nforgiving the Maik family. He would be sending the message that their past\nbetrayal had been wiped clean. The Maiks would be elevated to the right\nhand of the Kauls. Other families would be jealous and angry. If he did not\ngive his permission, however, he would hurt Hilo—and Hilo could be\ndramatically hurt. He would damage the relationship with his brother and his\nHorn at a time when the clan could not afford any further weakness in the\nfamily.\nLan’s arms and legs felt heavy enough to sink him straight through the\ncushioned chair. It seemed everything in the clan required a decision from\nhim that would invariably hurt or offend others and cause further problems.\nLooking at Hilo’s face, though, he realized he couldn’t find it in himself\nto refuse his brother’s request. Even if he’d known how things would turn out\nwith Eyni, would he never have taken a gamble on overcoming the odds? He\ndidn’t think he could say so. As for Hilo and Wen, all the objections Lan had\nvoiced—past sins, clan politics, superstition—they didn’t touch those few\nseconds last night in the Lilac Divine when Maik Kehn had answered the\nPillar’s unspoken panic with, “He’s alive. He’s fine,” and Lan had\nunderstood, as he gripped the door frame, that he wasn’t ready to be a\nwartime Pillar. He wasn’t equipped to handle that kind of violent loss in his\nown family.\n“You’re right, Hilo. It’s better to think about today when tomorrow might\nnot happen. I give you my blessing to marry Maik Wen,” Lan said. He did his\nbest to sound as sincere and positive as such a statement warranted. “Set a\ndate. As soon as you want.”\nHilo left the chair and knelt on the carpet. He raised clasped hands to his\nforehead. “The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master,” Hilo said,\nreciting the ceremonial Green Bone clan oaths they’d both taken years ago.\n“Should I ever be disloyal to my brother, may I die by the blade.

Should I\never fail to come to the aid of my brother, may I die by the blade.

He didn’t look like someone who’d been through the same day as\nLan had.\nHilo got off the floor, gathered his weapons off the desk, and rested a\nhand on Lan’s shoulder as he left the room. He pointed at the pile of Gam’s\njade. “Get some sleep before you try putting it back on.”\nCHAPTER\n23\nAutumn Festival Gifts\nT\nhe wind howled and needles of rain hit the back of Bero’s neck as he\nhefted the last of the boxes into the van and clambered in after it. The other\nboy, who they called Cheeky, yanked the back doors shut. “Go! GO!” Bero\nshouted at the driver.\nThe van squealed into motion, throwing Bero against the wall of the\nvehicle. He crawled up and around the containers packed with cartons of\nexpensive brand-name wallets, shoes, handbags, and belts—and squeezed\nthrough the middle of the van into the passenger side seat. He stuck his head\nout the window to look behind them—the truck driver was still lying on his\nstomach under his semitrailer with his hands over his head. There was no\nsign of pursuit.\nPulling his head back into the van, Bero rolled up the window and relaxed\na little, then more so once the van hit the KI-1 freeway, speeding southward\naway from the Docks. The rain picked up, splattering the windshield as fast\nas the noisy wipers could handle. Through the shimmery glare of water, the\nlights of the other cars on the road were bright red splotches, like Autumn\nFestival lamps. Bero shoved the pistol more securely into the waistband of\nhis pants and whooped as he punched the van’s ceiling. “That was cut,\nkekes.”\nThe entire operation had taken less than five minutes. Speed and planning\nwere the key to a successful lift. Security was tight, and mistakes were\ndeadly; armed guards protected the ships, and Green Bones patrolled the\nDocks. The best approach was to hijack trailer trucks once they had been\nloaded but before they entered the motorway. Bero was new at this game, but\nhe was a quick study and hungry for work. This was his third successful lift\nin as many weeks. That pleased Mudt, which in turn, pleased the people\nbehind Mudt, people Bero very much wanted to meet.\nThe driver of the van, an untalkative man named Tas, who had bad skin\nand only ever wore black T-shirts, pulled the van off the freeway into the\nsouth part of Junko.

He drove into the alley behind the Goody Too discount\nstore and backed up to the open garage door. Mudt came out to inspect the\ngoods. He grunted in satisfaction and counted out payment on the top of a\nsecondhand pool table while Cheeky unloaded the merchandise with the help\nof Mudt’s teenage son. “You have to be more careful now,” Mudt said,\nthrowing in an extra bit of cash for each of them. “The clans are going at each\nother.”\nClan war was both opportunity and danger. Green Bones busy fighting\neach other were less vigilant against thieves and smugglers, but they made up\nfor the lapse by being more merciless to those they caught, especially any\nwith possible ties to enemy clans. “You got more tips for us?” Bero asked,\nzipping the money into the inside pocket of his jacket. A gust of strong wind\nrattled the half-open garage door.\nMudt pulled a folded manila envelope from his back pocket and held it\nout to Tas. The man shook his head. “I’m out.”\n“You’re out?” Bero exclaimed. “After that kind of a lift?”\nTas grumbled, “Not ready to die yet. Gonna quit while I’m ahead.” He\njerked his chin at Bero. “Give it to him.” Tas walked back to the van.\nMudt didn’t even watch Tas go. He passed the envelope to Bero, who\nopened it and glanced inside quickly: several sheets of paper stapled together.\nA list of JK Trucking company’s schedule in and out of Summer Harbor for\nthe next sixty days. He smiled, impressed at Mudt’s access to such useful\ninformation. He stowed it inside his jacket next to the cash.\nA blast of rain blew into the garage, drenching the concrete floor, shaking\nbox flaps and loose items. “Hey!” Mudt shouted at his son. “Close that door\nbefore we drown here. Then go back out front and start taping up the\nwindows. Yofo’s in a fucking mood. Typhoon’s coming, tomorrow or the\nday after, for sure.” He ran a hand through his damp, wiry hair. His sleeve\nfell a few inches down his forearm and Bero glimpsed needle track marks on\nthe inside of the man’s wrists. Mudt motioned Cheeky over, then said to both\nhim and Bero, in a conspiratorial voice, “You boys have been doing good. So\ngood that someone wants to meet you. Maybe move you up, give you some\nmore work. You cut with that?”\n“Yeah, I’m cut,” Bero said. Cheeky gave a nervous sniff but nodded.\n“I thought so.” Mudt turned toward the store. “Let’s go, then.”\n“He’s here right now?” Bero asked.\n“Right here, right now,” Mudt sang out, jovial, gesturing for them to\nfollow him. “Today’s your lucky night, kekes.”\nThey walked through the inside garage door into the front of the store. It\nwas long past closing time and the place was locked up. One strip of\nfluorescent lighting was turned on near the back, illuminating racks of\nsunglasses and bins of plastic sandals near the entrance to the restrooms."

One strip of\nfluorescent lighting was turned on near the back, illuminating racks of\nsunglasses and bins of plastic sandals near the entrance to the restrooms.\nShadowy aisles stretched away into the rest of the building. The only other\ntwo people inside were Mudt’s son, who was unrolling blue masking tape in\nlarge Xs across the windows, and a man, sitting in the dark on the cash\nregister counter, a duffel bag on the ground below his feet.\nMudt walked Bero and Cheeky over to the man and brought his hands up\nto his forehead in salute. “These are the guys I told you about,” Mudt said.\n“One of them wasn’t hungry enough and bailed out, so it’s just the two of\nthem now.”\nThe man hopped off the table. He was a Green Bone, with a short goatee,\njade bolts through his ears, and a jade ring in his nose. He wore a long forest\ngreen rain slicker over dark clothes and boots. He looked Bero and Cheeky\nover with mild interest, the hollows of his eyes shadowed. “What’re your\nnames?”\nBero told him, then raised clasped hands. “And what do we call you, jen?”\n“You don’t call me anything,” said the Green Bone. “I don’t know you\nand you don’t know me. This is No Peak territory. So if you’re caught by any\nof Kaul’s men, and they torture the shit out of you, you won’t be screaming\nmy name.” At the boys’ silence, a smile curved the man’s mouth. “Does that\nfrighten you? If it does, you might want to consider stepping back out that\ndoor the way you came.”\n“We’re not frightened,” said Cheeky, not altogether convincingly.\n“I want what Mudt has,” Bero said. “Just tell me how to get it.”\nThe Green Bone gave a knowing nod. “Jade fever’s a bitch, isn’t it? If you\ngot your hands on a piece of green right now, without any training or some\nquality shine, you’d give off an aura like a fucking fire alarm. The first Green\nBone to come anywhere near you would know you for a thief and kill you in\nthree seconds flat.” The man paused, tugging lightly on his goatee. “Now\nMudt here is a special case. See, he’s a friend of the clan: He tells us things\nwe need to know, he does work for us in places we can’t be. We appreciate\nthat, so we take care of him. He has, let’s call it … associate status. You\ncould have that too, if you prove yourself to the clan.”\nThe boys nodded.\n“Good. Green Bones take jade from the bodies of their enemies. So if\nyou’re going to be a warrior, you’ll need weapons.” The goateed Green Bone\nknelt and unzipped the duffel bag at his feet. He withdrew a Fullerton C55\nsubmachine gun. He handed it to Bero, then pulled out a second one and gave\nit to Cheeky. Bero felt the weight of the thing in his hands and sucked in a\nbreath.

You’re giving these to us?”\n“Happy Autumn Festival,” said the man. “You better practice a whole lot\nbefore I send you to use them. Mudt will show you how.” The Green Bone\nrose deadly fast and wrapped a hand around each of the boys’ throats. With\nno time to move or gasp, they froze. With his Strength he could tear out their\nwindpipes. “If I hear that you held up a gas station or shot any bystanders, I’ll\nbreak all your bones, and then your necks. You work for me now, you\nunderstand?”\nThe boys nodded and he released them, giving them each a reassuring pat.\n“For the time being, learn to use those things.

Mudt’s son had finished taping the windows and disappeared into\nthe back room.\nThe goateed Green Bone slung his duffel bag over his shoulder. “Best be\ngoing. The neighborhood and the weather aren’t so friendly. Mudt, good\ndoing business with you, as usual.” He extended to Mudt the final item he’d\nbrought out from the bag, an unmarked white cardboard container the size of\na small shoebox, sealed with packing tape. Mudt reached for it eagerly, but\nthe Green Bone pulled it back at the last second, holding it just out of reach.\nHis voice lowered, treading a line between friendly concern and unmistakable\nthreat. “Are you following the rules, Mudt? Same dose every day, no\nhoarding or reselling?” When Mudt nodded vehemently, the Green Bone\nhanded him the box and smiled. “Always important to have safety\nreminders.”\n“Thank you, jen,” Mudt murmured, his relief palpable.\nThe Green Bone lifted the hood of his rain slicker over his head. His boots\nclomped down the dark center aisle of the Goody Too. He turned the lock,\nopened the door, and walked out into the approaching typhoon.\nCHAPTER\n24\nAfter the Typhoon\nT\nyphoon Lokko hit Kekon two days before the Autumn Festival, as if Yofo\nthe Unforgiving had awoken in time to meet the end-of-season deadline.

No Peak\nhad paid for all the supplies. Academy students divided and packed them into\nsmaller boxes for distribution to people who would need them in the\ntyphoon’s aftermath. Green Bones protected and came to the aid of the\ncommon people in times of need; it had been that way for as long as there\nhad been Green Bones.\nAnden cut the plastic wrapping off flats of canned vegetables as the lights\nshook and water sluiced the dark windows like the inside of a car wash. The\ncampus had a backup generator in case of power outage, but if that failed,\nthey would have to work with headlamps and flashlights. Despite the raging\nof the elements outside, the conversation inside the hall was animated.\n“My folks have two shops in Sogen,” said Heike heatedly, “which will be\na godsdamned war zone. If the Mountain can’t have the Armpit, they’ll go\nafter Sogen. I already told them, if things get any worse, it’s not worth the\nrisk; you either close up those locations or you eat the cost of double tribute\nuntil things sort themselves out.”\n“Going to war with the Mountain,” muttered Lott, breaking apart jumbo\nblister packs of batteries. “The Kauls are out of their minds.” His hands\nstilled in midmotion and he glanced over at Anden, so quickly no one else\nnoticed it. Quick defiance flashed across Lott’s features. He shifted his gaze\naway and pushed the hair from his eyes. “Green Bones are always\nbloodthirsty, though. How would we prove who’s greener if we didn’t look\nfor excuses to fight each other? That’s what we’re here for after all, isn’t it?\nTo become warriors.”\nThere was a moment of uncomfortable silence from the others. If Lott had\nspoken in a casual or self-deprecating manner, they might’ve brushed it off or\ngrumbled some mildly cynical agreement, but his delivery had been too\nresentful and acidic. Anden dropped his own eyes, his face warming.\n“That’s a narrow way of looking at it,” replied Pau Noni, with some heat\nof her own. Pau came from a family wealthy and modern enough to have sent\nnot just sons but daughters to the Academy—a more common occurrence on\nKekon these days than back in the time when Ayt Yu had sent his adopted\ndaughter to be trained in the same manner as her brothers. “Being educated as\na Green Bone opens up opportunities,” Pau pointed out. “We’re part of an\nhonorable tradition. Even if you never fight in a duel, once you’re a graduate\nof the Academy, you’ve proven something. No one can take that away from\nyou.”\n“Unless they kill you,” Lott replied. “If there’s a clan war, we’ll be\nexpected to fight. We’ll be fresh meat for the Mountain as soon as we get our\njade.”"

We’ll be fresh meat for the Mountain as soon as we get our\njade.”\nPau said with challenge in her voice, “You could also say there’re bound\nto be more chances to move up in the clan. If you’re the right sort.”\n“And what if you don’t want to be the right sort?” Lott countered.\n“Go into medicine or teaching, then,” Heike said. “Or become a penitent.”\nLott let out a loud, derisive snort and shook his head, yanking apart a\nplastic package so that heavy batteries clattered out and rolled across the\ntable.\nDudo threw up his hands. “What’s left to do, be a Year-Eight Yomo?”\nThat made everyone chuckle uncomfortably and diffused some of the\ntension that had been building. A few students dropped out of the Academy\neach year—much to the everlasting shame of their families—but typically\nsuch occurrences happened early in training. Only one person, over a decade\nago, had left the Academy in his final year and not graduated as a Green\nBone. His name was still invoked by the instructors, with near mythological\novertones, in harsh cautionary reference to the possibility of spectacular\nfailure and disgrace at the eleventh hour.\nColor rose into Lott’s face and he gathered the fallen batteries with quick,\nstiff movements. “Of course not,” he muttered, eyes downcast, though scorn\nremained in his voice.\nTon coughed deliberately and returned the conversation to the situation\nbetween the clans. “Personally, I think it’s the Horn that wants war. Kaul Lan\ndoesn’t seem the type.”\n“See, that sort of talk is exactly why the Pillar had to take a stand,” Dudo\nexclaimed. “About fucking time, too. The Mountain came after his brother;\nwhat did they expect? Good for him, showing everyone that he’s as thick-\nblooded as the old Kaul.” Dudo was a typical Academy student. The second\nson of a prominent Lantern Man family, his elder brother would inherit the\nfamily business while Dudo would wear jade and swear oaths to serve the\nclan, thus ensuring the family’s continued favor and prominence within No\nPeak. This seemed to suit Dudo fine, as he had no interest in component\nmanufacturing, or tact. “Ever since the Torch got old and retired, the other\nclans assume No Peak’s in decline. They won’t pay us respect unless some\nblood gets spilled once in a while.”\nThe assassination attempt on Kaul Hilo and the ensuing showdown in\nfront of the Factory had been the subject of constant conversation at the\nAcademy for the past two weeks. Everyone, it seemed, had a relative, or\nfriend, or relative of a friend, who was a Finger in No Peak and had been\nthere and seen Kaul Lan kill Gam Oben. It gave Anden a strange feeling to\nknow that Gam—the dark, athletic-looking Second Fist who’d saved him\nfrom the Wie Lon boys outside the Hot Hut, a man with no small amount of\njade—was now dead by Lan’s hand.\nAnden stacked cans of wax beans in boxes and stayed out of the\ndiscussion.

        "text": "Anden stacked cans of wax beans in boxes and stayed out of the\ndiscussion. Perhaps because he was unlucky enough to have inherited his\nfather’s light coloring and foreign eyes, when he remained quiet about clan\nissues, the other students tended to speak freely around him, forgetting who\nhe was. He was already a mixed-race bastard, the prodigious son of an\ninfamous mother, and, they all suspected, queer (though how that had,\nmortifyingly, gotten back to Hilo, Anden still had no idea). At any rate, he\nwasn’t keen to openly advertise the Kaul family’s patronage and give his\nclassmates more reason to keep him at a wary distance.\nListening now, however, he had to bite back frustration. For once, he\nwanted to flaunt his status in the clan and speak up, to tell his classmates that\nthey didn’t really know the Kauls. Lan and Hilo were human beings with\nworries and flaws like everyone else, and they were doing the best they could\nfor the clan—no jadeless student had a right to judge them. Certainly not Lott\nJin—what did he know?\nAnden clamped his jaw and moved away from the group to unload\nanother box. Why hadn’t he said something to rebuke Lott before Pau and\nDudo had? It was his family involved in the war, his cousins—more like his\nbrothers—that Lott had openly disparaged. If Anden had been a Kaul in\nblood and name, those might’ve been fighting words. He ought to have\ndemanded an apology, but now it was too late. His lifelong habit of being\nunassuming, and his feelings for Lott Jin, had stuck his tongue and now the\nmoment had passed.\nThe wind outside of the Gathering Hall roared like an animal in pain.\nAnden tried to tell himself it was better that he’d kept quiet. There was no\ncall to take any of the talk personally. To most people in Janloon, clan war\nwas like the typhoon outside: a force of nature, something to hide from,\nendure, bemoan, and remark upon, the deadly toll inevitable and later to be\ntallied. Out of all the students in the room discussing the war, to Anden alone\nwas it so personal.\nHe’d heard the news of what happened no sooner than anyone else, passed\ninitially as rumors in the dining hall at breakfast: “Did you hear? The Horn’s\nbeen shot dead.” Anden had nearly dropped the bowl he’d been carrying. A\nhorrible icy shock and disbelief had flooded him from head to toe. Before he\ncould even turn around to locate the speaker, someone else spoke up: “That’s\nnot true. They tried to kill him, but it was one of his Fists that was shot. The\nHorn’s still alive, but some of the assassins escaped and now the Kauls are\ngoing to go after the Mountain.”\n“Where did you hear this?” Anden demanded, his hands shaking.\nThe table of year-sixes looked up at him with startled expressions. “My\nbrother’s a Finger who patrols the Armpit,” said the boy who’d just spoken.\n“I talked to him an hour ago. He said they’ve been up all night and have just\nbeen called to the Kaul house.”\nThe news continued to build into wild speculation and conflicting reports"

        "text": "“I talked to him an hour ago. He said they’ve been up all night and have just\nbeen called to the Kaul house.”\nThe news continued to build into wild speculation and conflicting reports\nby midday. The Pillar and the Horn had gone to the Factory. Blood had been\nshed. The residents of the Academy had no personal phones in their rooms; it\nwas evening by the time Anden, in a frenzy that everyone seemed to know\nmore about what was going on than he did, managed to get on the phone in\nthe dormitory hallway and call the Kaul house. Kyanla gave him the number\nto reach Hilo at his girlfriend’s apartment.\n“Don’t worry, Andy.” Hilo sounded to be in remarkably good spirits.\n“Is there anything I can do?” he asked.\n“Can you graduate by tomorrow? No? Then like I said, don’t worry.”\n“How about Lan-jen?” Anden was still having a hard time imagining Lan\nkilling a man in a duel to the death. Not that the Pillar wasn’t one of the most\npowerful Green Bones he knew, but he’d never seemed in need of violence.\nLan rarely even raised his voice. “Kyanla said he was out of the house seeing\na doctor. Is he all right?”\nThere was a brief pause on the line before Hilo said, “He’s the Pillar,\nAndy. He can handle whatever the Mountain throws at us, like he did today.\nDidn’t I say to you there’d be trouble like this? So don’t be surprised. Pass\nyour Trials, is all.”\n“I will,” Anden promised. “Six more months, and I’ll be able to help.”\n“I know, Andy, relax. I’m counting on it.”\nWhen he hung up, he was still edgy and troubled and had a hard time\nfalling asleep that night. All his life, Anden had thought of the Kauls as near\ninvincible. He could muster nothing but resentment and contempt for his\nforeign father (Espenians were all the same: shallow, arrogant, and faithless)\nand his mother had been a tragedy of poor judgment and insanity that\ninspired in him a combination of grief, disdain, and horror. The Kauls were\nthe family he wished he’d been born into.\nNow, as Anden busied himself in a corner of the Gathering Hall, stacking\nfinished boxes and not returning to the conversation with Lott and the others,\nhe thought about what had happened to him on Boat Day. When he’d been\ntaken into Gont’s car and driven to meet with Ayt, he’d been viewed as a\nKaul, had been anxiously aware of being a Kaul—and yet also treated like a\nchild and powerless to help in any meaningful way. He felt the same way\nnow.\nWhen the typhoon was over, Janloon looked as if it had been power washed\nby a horde of clumsy giants. Trees and electrical poles were knocked down,\ncars overturned, and some parts of Fishtown, the Forge, and the Temple\nDistrict were flooded. Anden and his Academy classmates spent several days\nmanning relief centers and distributing supplies to people without electricity,\nrunning water, or enough food. At times like this, there was peace on the\nstreets. The clans tended to the people of their own territories and helped their\nLantern Men to clean up and rebuild.

In disputed or neutral areas, the clans\nworked alongside each other in unspoken temporary truce.\nOn the afternoon of Autumn Festival itself, Anden found himself clearing\ndebris from the roads in the Temple District. The typhoon had broken the last\nof the summer heat and cleared the skies into startling, smog-free blue.\n“Happy Autumn Festival!” people shouted to each other, with some sarcasm,\nas they threw rubble into industrial garbage bins and swept sidewalks. The\ncrowds milling in and out of the district’s many houses of worship were\nsmaller than usual, but there were still plenty of chanting and firecrackers to\nbe heard echoing up and down the neighborhood.\n“Let’s wheel that bin over there to the curb,” Lott said, pointing to a dense\ntangle of fallen tree branches in the street. Anden followed Lott, hauling the\ntrash bin behind him. They set it down and worked together, gathering and\nbreaking the splintered wood, filling the container. They did not speak at\nfirst; Anden was trying to decide whether to still be angry at Lott for his\ncomments in the Gathering Hall two days ago. If Lott noticed Anden’s\nfrequent, involuntary glances at him, he did not acknowledge or return them.\nHe seemed absorbed in the current task and distant in his thoughts, his sulky\nmouth set in a slight frown as his ropy arms tensed, snapping branch after\nbranch.\nAnden turned away, exasperated with himself, and bent to pick up\nscattered roof shingles. He did not personally know anyone else who was\nqueer besides Master Teoh, the senior Perception instructor. Lott, he was not\nsure about. They were in the same circle of friends, but Anden could not call\nLott a friend in a personal sense—they were always together with other\npeople, and Lott had closer companions such as Dudo and Heike, with whom\nhe spent his free time. Anden had never tried to interject himself into their\nclose circle or to be so presumptuous as to seek his classmate out alone. He’d\nheard Lott express interest in women in the typical casual way, although as\nfar as Anden knew, those had never turned into anything particularly serious.\nSerious relationships were not easy for anyone to accomplish at the\nAcademy, which maintained a traditionally monastic attitude regarding\nromantic relationships between students—which was to say, it was officially\nforbidden.\nStill, there were times when Anden thought he caught something from the\nother young man—a gaze held overlong, a quickness to be on the same side\nin a game of pick-up relayball, an interest glimpsed in an act as mundane as\nsharing the task of breaking up and clearing debris from a street.\nThe Kekonese viewed queerness as a natural occurrence in the population,\nmuch like stone-eyes, and did not blame the person in question any more than\none would blame a child for being born deaf. Like stone-eyes, though, they\nwere considered unfortunate and unlucky, a sign that a family had fallen into\ndisfavor with the gods, who saw fit to prune the offending lineage as\npunishment.

Anden was not surprised or particularly troubled by this view.\nHe already knew his family was cursed. In general, however, people were\nuncomfortable around misfortune and reluctant to admit to their own. He was\ncertain that some people at the Academy tugged their right earlobes behind\nhis back—but glancing at Lott again, watching him pause to draw a forearm\nover his sweaty brow and stretch his long spine before reaching for another\nbranch, he felt a hurtful pang in his chest to imagine that Lott might be one of\nthem.\nAbruptly, Lott said, “I heard about what happened to you on Boat Day.”\nAnden was startled. He paused before tossing a chunk of rubble into the\nbin and wiping his dusty hands on his pants. He hadn’t told anyone at the\nAcademy about what had happened on Boat Day, not because he meant to\nkeep it a secret, but because it was not in his nature to draw attention to\nhimself. The conversations he’d had with Gont and Ayt seemed like clan\nbusiness that Lan and Hilo might not want spread around, so he’d told his\nclassmates he’d gotten lost in the crowd and made his way back to the\nAcademy alone.\nLott said, “I heard it from my da.”\nAnden nodded slowly. It had slipped his mind that Lott’s father was a\nhigh-ranking Fist. It was strange to think he probably answered directly to\nHilo. “He was there?” Anden couldn’t remember all the men who’d been\nflanking the Horn that day.\n“He was disappointed the Mountain let you go.” Lott’s sulky mouth\ntwisted with black amusement. “The Horn would’ve gone to war for you, he\nsaid. He would’ve gotten to storm Little Hammer, win more jade for himself,\nmy da. Had a building surrounded already and everything.”\nAnden looked away, pulling off his glasses and wiping specks of grit from\nthe lenses to hide his confusion. Whenever he felt he and Lott shared some\nmoment of possible friendship, some connection, no matter how minor, there\nwould be, not long after, something to suggest the complete opposite. This\nseemed to be one of those instances. Why would Lott tell him such a thing?\n“Then I guess your da is happy now, with the war looking so likely,”\nAnden said, his voice a monotone that did not hide the fact he thought Lott’s\ncomment had been in poor taste. “I didn’t even have to die to start it.”\nLott smirked. “Don’t take it personal, keke. I don’t care what my da\nthinks.” He tossed another branch into the trash bin, then leaned against it, his\ndark eyes climbing over Anden with interest. Anden’s pulse gave a skip.\nLott said, “You’ve got a lot more going on than you let show, don’t you?\nYou’re more clan than the rest of us, but you stay quiet about it. I can’t quite\nfigure out if that’s who you really are.” His tone was idly curious, but there\nwas a perplexed intensity to his gaze, perhaps even a touch of anger.\nUncomfortably, Anden tried to think of how to answer.\nFrom the other side of the intersection, Ton called out, “Look at that.”"

A shiny black ZT\nValor was driving slowly down the street, towing a flatbed trailer with two\nMountain Green Bones, a man and a woman, sitting perched on the end of it.\nThe car stopped on a street corner and honked. The two Green Bones hopped\noff and began handing out yellow cakes from long aluminum trays crammed\nwith the traditional festive treat. A crowd quickly formed, pressing eagerly\nbut respectfully up to the vehicle. “Happy Autumn Festival,” the Green\nBones said. “One each, please. Happy Autumn Festival.”\nThe door of the Valor opened and Gont Asch stepped out. Even dressed\nfor the holiday in a white shirt and dark suit, with most of his jade out of\nsight, his physical presence was such that the throng made room for him at\nonce. “Thank you, Gont-jen,” they called, saluting him. “May the gods shine\nfavor on the Mountain.” The Horn of the Mountain nodded amiably, spoke to\nsome of the crowd, remarked upon the cleanup efforts, and handed out\nyellow cakes. Anden went back to his work, studiously ignoring the scene,\nbut his jaw was clenched as he broke discarded tree branches over his knee\nwith greater and greater force.\n“You four. Academy boys,” Gont’s deep voice called. “Come here.”\nThey hesitated, looking at each other, but it would be blatantly impolite\nnot to obey. Ton and Dudo approached, and after another moment of\nhesitation, Lott and Anden followed. Gont handed each of them a yellow\ncake—warm and soft, freshly baked, smelling of butter and fruit paste. “For\nyour hard work,” said the Horn.\nTon, Dudo, and Lott looked down at the cakes in their hands with nervous\nsurprise. “Thank you, Gont-jen,” Ton murmured, and the other two echoed\nhim, saluting one-handed as they retreated judiciously. Before Anden could\ndo the same, Gont wrapped an arm around his shoulders with the slow weight\nof a python’s coils. He spoke in a low rumble, too near Anden’s ear for the\nothers to overhear. “I’m disappointed you didn’t accept our offer.”\nThe first time he’d met Gont in front of the Hot Hut in Summer Park,\nAnden had been intimidated, impressed by the man’s powerful and eloquent\npresence. Now he thought, Gont Asch tried to kill my cousins. He wants to\nsee everyone in the Kaul family dead. He could feel all the jade on the man’s\narm, the weight of its dense energy resting across the back of his neck. Anden\nforced himself to raise his eyes to meet the Horn’s. “I may look Espenian on\nthe outside, Gont-jen,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean I can be bribed like a\ndog.”\nWith no surprise or hint of affront in his voice, Gont said, “Today is the\nAutumn Festival and the gods expect us to show generosity.

It would be a shame for us to be enemies.” Gont\nreleased Anden and returned to the Valor and its towed cargo of cakes.\nAnden rejoined his classmates, who were standing on the other side of the\nstreet, wiping cake crumbs from their mouths. “What did he say to you?” Lott\nasked, looking at Anden with even more curious uncertainty than before.\n“He wished me a Happy Autumn Festival.” Anden stared down at the\nwarm pastry in his hand but did not feel like eating it. He watched Gont’s car\nmove down the street. “And he wanted to make it clear that if I become a Fist\nin No Peak, the Mountain will make a point of killing me.”\nCHAPTER\n25\nLines Drawn\nA\nlthough the Mountain stopped terrorizing No Peak’s properties in the\nArmpit, Kaul Hilo was well aware that his clan had otherwise gained little\nfrom the agreement. Their rivals had surrendered the parts of the district that\nwere rightfully No Peak’s to begin with and shrewdly kept control of their\nstrongholds south of Patriot Street, which included Janloon’s most profitable\nbetting houses.\nHe could spare neither the time nor the manpower to further bolster their\nposition in the Armpit, on account of being diverted by trouble in the Docks.\nThe Docks! Of all places. Undisputed No Peak turf, home to long-standing\nbusinesses like the Twice Lucky and the Lilac Divine. A crime spree had\nerupted—thieves were raiding transport trailers carrying imported luxury\ngoods and reselling them on the black market. The culprits, as far as anyone\ncould tell, were common street gangs, but the scale and timing of the\noutbreak were cause for suspicion. Hilo’s intuition was confirmed when\nKehn and his Fingers caught three of the thieves who, under persuasion,\nadmitted that a man whose name they didn’t know—a man with jade—had\nprovided them with trucking schedules and cargo manifests out of Summer\nHarbor.\n“What do we do with them, Hilo-jen?” Kehn asked over the phone.\nHilo pulled the metal phone cord as far as it would go, stepping around\nthe corner and turning his back to the nurse wheeling an empty bed down the\nhospital corridor. He put a hand over the other ear to block out the clatter of\nwheels on linoleum. In the background of wherever Kehn was calling from,\nhe heard cursing, sobbing, and incoherent muffled noises. Thieves were the\nmost despised kind of criminal on Kekon. Lifting shipments of watches and\nhandbags normally merited a beating and a branding, but this was different.\nThis had Gont Asch’s fingerprints on it. The Mountain was not above\nrecruiting jadeless criminals to harass No Peak on their behalf.\n“Kill two of them, let the most talkative one go,” Hilo said.\nHe hung up and went in to see Tar. “Good news,” he said. “They’re\ntelling me you’ll be out of here in a couple of days.”\nTar was sitting up in bed.

        "text": "telling me you’ll be out of here in a couple of days.”\nTar was sitting up in bed. Bullets had lacerated his spleen and perforated\nhis bowel; he’d been through surgeries and transfusions. Some of his jade had\nbeen removed before he’d gone into the operating room, and he was only\nnow strong enough to be wearing it again, but his aura was as thin and\nprickly as his mood. “About time. The doctors here don’t know shit, and the\nfood is terrible.”\n“I’ll have someone bring you something you like. What do you want?\nYou want some takeout noodles? Something spicy?”\n“Anything. I feel a lot better. That green doctor you sent did a good job.”\n“Prized family resource,” Hilo said. Green Bone physicians, technically\nbeholden to no clan but skilled at Channeling therapeutically, were rare and\nin high demand. Hilo had had Dr. Truw, the staff physician at Kaul Du\nAcademy, pay a few visits to Tar. Technically, that wasn’t allowed by the\nhospital, but no one was going to argue.\n“I’m going to marry your little sister,” Hilo told him. “Lan agreed, so it’s\nofficial in the clan. I’ll take good care of her, I promise.”\nTar said, “You know I’d follow you anywhere, whether you married Wen\nor not, right? Just get me out of this hospital already.”\n“I know,” Hilo said. “Relax while you can. I’ll be needing you plenty, as\nsoon as you’re out.” It was plain that Tar was bitter about being wounded and\naway from the action, but Hilo didn’t feel like assuaging his Fist’s ego, or\ntalking business. “You have a good suit?” he asked. “You’ll need to look\ngood for the wedding.”\nHilo was, at least, pleased and relieved that after the attempt on his life,\nWen had quickly acquiesced to living on the Kaul estate. “I’ll move into the\nmain house,” he’d reassured her, though the thought of rooming down the\nhall from his grandfather made him grimace. “You’ll be in the Horn’s house.\nYou can do whatever you like to it. New carpet, new paint, whatever. Spend\nwhat you like, the money doesn’t matter.”\n“Yes,” she said, her lips pale and firm, her face weary from nights spent at\nthe hospital by Tar’s bedside. She glanced around her small but tidy and\nwell-decorated apartment with detachment, as if she was ready to leave at\nonce. “You’re right. Now I know how badly our enemies want you dead. My\npride isn’t worth the risk of them using me to hurt you.”\nHaving gotten his way, he felt grateful and affectionate. He gathered Wen\ninto his arms and kissed her face many times. “There’s nothing for you to be\nashamed of,” he said. “We’re engaged now. I asked Lan. He gave us his\nblessing. Kaul Maik Wen—don’t you like the sound of that? We can plan a\nwedding, a big one. Pick a date.

She said, with little expression, “Lan is a good\npeacetime Pillar, but he’s not a commander of Fists. There’s no one else with\nenough jade and respect in the clan to be a strong wartime Horn in your\nplace. The Mountain knows that without you, Lan will have no choice but to\ngive in to them. That’s why they’re clever to want to kill you first, and why\nthey’ll try again.”\nHilo frowned. This wasn’t the discussion he’d hoped to elicit after sharing\nthe news that they were to be married. “Let the fuckers try.” He cupped\nWen’s chin to look into her eyes. “Are you worried about being a young\nwidow, like my ma? Is that why you’re not excited about the wedding? I’m\nexcited. I thought you’d be excited.”\n“Should I be? Womanishly thrilled about dress shopping and banquet\nplanning, while others plan the murder of my fiancé and my brothers?”\n“You don’t have to talk down to me like that,” Hilo said, irritated. “I’ll\nalways have enemies, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be happy. You\nhave to trust me, Wen. If anything happens to me, or to Kehn and Tar, you’ll\nbe taken care of, I promise you that. I’ll make sure everything I leave is in\nyour name. You won’t even be tied to the clan like my ma was, if you don’t\nwant to be.”\nWen was silent for a moment. “Now that I’m going to be part of the\nfamily, there’s no reason why I shouldn’t work in the clan. Kehn and Tar are\nyour First and Second Fists. You could use me too, put me somewhere in No\nPeak where I’ll be of help in the war when it comes.”\nHilo shook his head. “This war’s not for you to worry about.”\n“Because I’m a woman?”\n“Because you’re a stone-eye,” he said. “This is between Green Bones.”\nWen let her arms fall to her sides and stepped back, opening space\nbetween them. “I come from a Green Bone family. You said yourself I have\nthe heart and mind of a jade warrior.”\n“That doesn’t make you one.” Hilo was disturbed by the direction this\nconversation had taken. “You know I don’t believe the bullshit about jade\nbringing people closer to the gods, or stone-eyes being bad luck, none of that.\nBut if you’re not a Green Bone, then there’s a different life for you. Not\nbetter or worse, but not a Green Bone’s life. You can do anything else you\nwant, but not this.”\n“Other clans have made use of their stone-eyes. Stone-eyes can move\nfreely through the city. We can handle jade without giving off an aura. You\ntold me that Tem Ben the Carver is a stone-eye from the Mountain and does\ntheir bidding still.”\nA sense of terror and rage rose and coated the inside of Hilo’s nose and\nmouth. “You’re not anything like Tem Ben,” he said in a low voice. “Tem"

He’s a dead man. You will never be like him.”\nHe seized Wen by the arms, so quickly that she didn’t even have time to\nflinch. He was aware at all times of how slow and soft she was, how\nvulnerable, how easily he could hurt or break her—and the thought of her in\nperil from his enemies, other Green Bones, filled him with a fear he did not\nhave for his own life. “The Mountain will do anything. They’ll recruit\ncommon thieves, they’ll send a stone-eye to smuggle inside No Peak territory\n—I suppose next they’ll send children against us. I won’t do that. I won’t\nsend a stone-eye into a Green Bone war. I won’t ever use you like that.\nNothing will change my mind on this. Understand?” He shook her.\n“Yes,” she said meekly.\nHe softened and enfolded her again with a sigh. “I think maybe you’re\nbored at your job.” Wen worked as a secretary at a legal office. “You’re too\nsmart for that kind of work. After we’re married, you can quit and do what\nyou want. You want to go back to school? You could do that. Or you want to\nstart your own business, doing interior design type of stuff? You’re good at\nthat for sure. We can think about it.”\n“Yes,” Wen said. “We can think about it more. Later.”\nSurely a talk with the Weather Man’s office would provide Wen with a\nnumber of good options. The clan had Lantern Men with connections in\nalmost any field one could think of. He was not about to approach Doru,\nthough. He would wait until Lan had the old pervert ousted, then he’d speak\nto someone like Hami Tumashon.\nHe needed to speak to Shae again as well. He hadn’t seen or spoken to her\nin weeks. As someone who was open and expressive with his emotions, Hilo\nhad long harbored the vaguely resentful suspicion that he loved his family\nmore than they loved him back, and with no one was this feeling more\npronounced than with his sister. How could Shae be so cold? It bothered Hilo\nmore than he let on. Had she come back to Kekon merely to make the rest of\nthem feel sorry for her? To punish them with rejection? Clearly, she was\nsuffering self-esteem issues, what with the way she continued to inflict jade\ndeprivation on herself as some abnormal form of penance. He thought that\nperhaps he’d been too hard on her, said hurtful things at one time (as if she\nhadn’t done the same), and that was one reason she’d run off to Espenia. But\nhe was ready to forget all that. They were both adults now. They were Kauls;\nthey had responsibilities. The three of them had to stand together if they were\ngoing to keep No Peak strong. Sometimes he felt as if he was the only one\nwho could see that clearly. If he talked to Shae again, and if Lan would stop\nhandling their sister with kid gloves and back him up, he thought he might"

If he talked to Shae again, and if Lan would stop\nhandling their sister with kid gloves and back him up, he thought he might\nconvince her of his sincerity and get her to ease off her aloof and intransigent\nposition.\nNot that he had seen much of Lan lately either. Their conversations on the\nphone were frequent, but brief and tactical—what was happening, what\nneeded to be done. Hilo instructed his Fists to kill any other gangsters caught\nthieving in the Docks. Elsewhere, he shored up his clan’s defenses. He\npromoted Iyn, Obu, and a few other senior Fingers to Fists and reassigned\nterritories to more effectively protect No Peak’s most valuable areas and\nholdings. He went around the city, personally visiting and reassuring all the\nLantern Men. “Keep your moon blades sharp,” he told his warriors. Mountain\njade was theirs for the taking if they came across the opportunity. His spies\ncompiled as accurate a report as they could of Gont’s organization: how\nmany Fists and Fingers he commanded, where they could be found, which\nones carried the most jade and were most formidable.\nStudying the list, it was apparent to Hilo that while strength of numbers\nwas roughly comparable between the two clans, No Peak was at a\ndisadvantage. The core swath of the clan’s territories bordered enemy-\ncontrolled districts to both the north and south. The Mountain had eliminated\ntwo smaller rivals in the past couple of years, and their Green Bones were on\naverage more experienced fighters. Hilo needed more warriors. Next spring,\nan especially large cohort of new Green Bones, including his cousin Anden,\nwould graduate from Kaul Du Academy, but until then, Hilo mused\nunhappily, he would have to make do.\nTheoretically, the clean-bladed duel at the Factory between Lan and Gam\nOben had preserved the peace, but in truth, it had merely given both sides an\nopportunity to regroup and consider their next moves. Even though the clans\nwere not officially at war, Hilo was certain it would not be long before the\ncurrent skirmishing and harassing escalated into outright bloodshed. Hilo also\nhad no doubt that the Mountain would not be discouraged after only one\nfailed attempt on his life. He was rarely at home anymore and thus had to\nremain constantly on guard. Sometimes after a long night, he parked in a\nshady spot he felt was safe, and stretched out in the back seat of the Duchesse\nand napped while Kehn sat watch.\nBeing the Horn had become entirely too much work and stress.\nCHAPTER\n26\nWar Maneuvers\nE\nvery seat in the long boardroom of the Ship Street office was taken. A\ndozen Lantern Men of No Peak—the presidents and executives of some of\nthe country’s largest companies—had come to hear directly from the Pillar\nand to question him about defensive measures and security for their\noperations. While disputes over territory and business were not uncommon,\nthe prospect of outright war between the two largest clans in the country was\nunprecedented, and it had the crowd of businessmen in a state of considerable\nconsternation.\n“Will projects that have already been granted the clan’s patronage be\nallowed to continue on schedule and as planned?” asked a real estate\ndeveloper Lan recognized as one of the Lantern Men he’d met on Boat Day."

Priority will be given to districts where the threat is greatest.”\n“What about the possibility of the Mountain disrupting commerce? They\ncontrol much of the trucking sector. Might they not attempt to lock us out and\nmake it difficult for us to deliver goods?” asked a man with a furniture import\nbusiness.\n“And what of sectors that will be hurt by the drop in tourism?” interrupted\na hotel owner. “Does the clan plan to do anything to support the hospitality\nindustry?”\nLan stood up; the murmurs running around the table ceased. “I cannot\nguarantee there will not be any impact on your businesses,” he said. “We are\nbeing threatened by another clan and have to be prepared for difficult times.\nWhat I can promise is that we will defend ourselves—every part of the clan,\nevery sector, every business.”\nThis seemed to make an impression on those gathered. The Pillar noticed\ntheir gazes lingering on all the new jade he was wearing, the irrefutable proof\nthat he’d recently been victorious, that he could back up words with force.\nLan cast an assessing look down the table. “I’m afraid we can’t address every\nquestion at this time. If you have additional specific concerns, make an\nappointment to discuss them with the Weather Man and myself. Enjoy your\nafternoon, gentlemen.”\n“May the gods shine favor on No Peak,” some of the Lantern Men\nmurmured, saluting as they exited. When they were all gone, Lan turned to\nDoru.\n“I would like you to go to Ygutan,” he said.\nDoru adeptly masked any surprise he felt. “Is that necessary, Lan-se?\nSurely, it’s important that I remain in Janloon at this time to help you deal\nwith the Lantern Men.”\n“We can put off additional meetings with the Lantern Men for a few\nweeks. I want you to find out what you can about the Mountain’s shine-\nproducing operations in Ygutan. Where are their facilities, who are their\nsuppliers and distributors, how much business they’re already doing. Pull\nevery string we have in that country and do it quietly. We need to know\nwhere our enemy is investing. It might be information that we can use against\nthem in the future if we need to.”\nDoru pursed his thin lips. Perhaps he sensed an ulterior motive; ever since\nthe duel at the Factory, Lan had been guarded around the Weather Man, and\nDoru surely understood that he was out of favor, but Lan did not want him to\nsuspect anything beyond that. Allowing some of his true anger to show, the\nPillar said harshly, “I need someone I trust to do this, Doru-jen. I wouldn’t\nsend anyone less capable or discreet.

We’ve had our differences lately, but\nwe can’t afford to have any doubts come between us right now. Will you do\nas I say from now on or not? If not, I’ll accept your resignation as Weather\nMan. You can keep the house; I wouldn’t make you move.”\nHe saw that he’d gambled correctly; the old advisor relaxed a little. Surely\nif the Pillar suspected Doru of treachery or meant to harm him, he wouldn’t\nshow his emotions like this. He would be careful to pretend to reconcile and\nkeep him close. Doru was reassured; he said quickly, “You wound me, Lan-\nse. I’ve disagreed with you only out of concern for the clan and for your\nsafety. You’re right, of course; we must find out more about the Mountain’s\noperations in Ygutan. I’ll leave tomorrow.”\nLan nodded and said, sounding mollified, “I appreciate your concerns,\nUncle Doru. I need you now more than ever. I’m sending two of the Horn’s\nmen with you to Ygutan. It’s not a very safe country, and gods forbid\nanything should happen.”\nThe faint smile that had begun to crawl over Doru’s mouth dissolved at\nthis news. He guessed at the truth: Lan did indeed want information about the\nMountain’s operations in Ygutan, but more importantly, he wanted Doru out\nof the way, watched constantly by Hilo’s men, something he could not\naccomplish here where Doru held sway on Ship Street, surrounded by his\nown people. He wasn’t worried about Doru’s activities in Ygutan. Hilo’s men\nwould report back regularly and would corroborate everything Doru\ndiscovered. There was nothing the man could do against the clan.\nLan’s outburst of pique had disguised any other negative intent Doru\nmight have Perceived, and having already agreed to go, the Weather Man\ncould not disagree with the Pillar’s security measures. “Whatever you think\nnecessary, Lan-se,” he said.\nAs soon as Doru was on a plane, Lan asked Woon to arrange an urgent\nmeeting on short notice with Chancellor Son Tomarho and twenty-five other\nmembers of the Royal Council of Kekon over an invited lunch at the Grand\nIsland Grill & Lounge.\nThe Grand Island was on the penthouse floor of the twenty-eight-story\nEight Skies Hotel in upscale North Sotto. The Lantern Man who owned the\nEight Skies closed it to other customers at Lan’s request. The Pillar arrived\nearly with Woon and greeted each of the councilmen as they arrived. News of\nthe duel at the Factory had been all over Janloon, and everyone Lan met these\ndays noticed and remarked on the new jade he’d added to his belt, the cuffs\non his wrists, the cord of beads around his neck. If it weren’t for the immense\nimportance of public perception right now, Lan would’ve resisted wearing all\nthe acquired jade. The injury he’d sustained from absorbing and repulsing\nGam’s Channeling attack lingered and made it hard to bear the heavy load.\nHe’d been to Dr. Truw for healing sessions and wasn’t feeling as ill as he’d\nbeen immediately after the duel, but he wasn’t feeling well either.

Sometimes\nhis heart would begin to race or he would break into a dizzy sweat. Anxiety\nflared without warning. His sleeplessness worsened and he was often edgy,\noff-kilter.\n“Far do your enemies flee, Kaul-jen,” the councilmen said as they arrived,\nvoicing the traditional expression of congratulations given to a recently\nvictorious Green Bone.\n“By the luck of Jenshu’s favor,” Lan replied, thanking them before\ninquiring, “How’s your wife’s health, Mr. Loyi?” or “Mrs. Nurh, did your\nhouse fare all right in the typhoon?” These twenty-one men and four women\nwere the most senior politicians loyal to No Peak. They came from longtime\nLantern Men or Green Bone families and owed their political and financial\nsuccess to the clan. Together, they held significant sway over the three-\nhundred-member Royal Council of Kekon.\nAfter a two-hour-long, no-expenses-spared lunch of mango coleslaw, fire-\nbreathing soup, and grilled octopus, during which no business was discussed,\nLan motioned for the table to be cleared. He began by commending\nChancellor Son at length for his farsightedness in proposing the recent bill to\nreform KJA ownership laws. “The No Peak clan completely supports the\ngovernment’s wish to ensure that the stewardship of Kekon’s jade is balanced\nand transparent. I’m grateful to be able to count on the clan’s friends in the\nRoyal Council to do what is right for the country.” Chancellor Son beamed\nand waved a fat hand modestly as the other council members tapped the table\nin applause. It was all in politeness, as everyone in the room was surely\naware it had been Lan himself who’d instructed Son to take such steps.\nLan let the applause fade, then said, somberly, “Unfortunately, I must\nmake you aware that these efforts come too late to rectify wrongs that have\nalready occurred.” He explained that he had brought them here so they would\nhear it from him first and directly: He would be exercising his codirectorship\npowers to suspend the activities of the Kekon Jade Alliance, bringing all\nmining operations to an immediate and indefinite halt. The clan had\ndiscovered significant financial discrepancies between mine production and\nTreasury records, he said, and given the importance of jade to the nation’s\neconomy, security, and identity, mining could not be allowed to continue\nuntil an independent audit was conducted. He strongly urged the Royal\nCouncil to call for and administer one as soon as possible. Operations would\nnot recommence until the problems had been identified and the KJA reform\nbills passed to ensure future oversight.\nSon Tomarho was the first to break the stunned hush that followed the\nPillar’s statement. The chancellor leaned his heavy elbows on the table and\ncleared his throat loudly, in a way that Lan could tell was meant to express\nthe man’s disappointment that he had not been personally consulted before\nsuch a drastic decision. “With all respect, Kaul-jen, why is this the first time\nwe are hearing about these accounting discrepancies? And why then is the\nWeather Man not here to explain them?”\n“The Weather Man is away on other important clan business,” Lan said,"

        "text": "we are hearing about these accounting discrepancies? And why then is the\nWeather Man not here to explain them?”\n“The Weather Man is away on other important clan business,” Lan said,\nanswering the second question and ignoring the first. Lan could not have\ndiscussed his intentions with Son earlier without risking Doru getting wind of\nthem—unless he’d revealed to the chancellor his unproven suspicions of\ntreachery within the leadership of the clan, something he would absolutely\nnot do with any Lantern Man, no matter how senior. If Doru was indeed a\nMountain collaborator and complicit or responsible for the discrepancies\nShae had discovered, by the time he returned from Ygutan, it would be too\nlate for him to halt an official investigation into the KJA’s books.\nThe long-faced councilwoman Nurh Uma asked the question on\neveryone’s minds. “Are we correct to assume you believe the Mountain clan\nis behind this?”\nLan gestured for the servers to refill the guests’ teacups. He didn’t drink\nfrom his own steaming cup; he’d been running a slight fever since last night\nand hot liquids made him sweat too profusely in public. “Yes,” he said,\n“that’s exactly what I believe.”\n“I find it difficult to believe that the Mountain is unilaterally manipulating\nthe jade supply so egregiously behind the backs of the council and the other\nclans,” said white-haired councilman Loyi Tuchada with obvious skepticism\nin his voice.\n“I would believe it,” said Nurh, who had family members on both the\nbusiness and military sides of the clan. “But Ayt Mada’s representatives will\nsurely deny any wrongdoing. What do you hope to accomplish with this\naudit, Kaul-jen?”\n“The clans depend on the support of the people as much as the people\ndepend on the protection of the clans; it has always been this way,” Lan said.\n“The nation will not want one clan to become too powerful, to control more\njade than all the others. If it comes to light that the Mountain has acted\nagainst the good of the country, public and political opinion will turn against\nthem. The results of the audit will lend urgency and credence to the council’s\ngoals of passing stricter oversight over KJA activities.”\nLan stopped to take a surreptitious, focusing breath. He’d abstained from\neating much lunch, but nevertheless he felt tired and mildly woozy. It was an\neffort to keep his attention entirely on controlling this important conversation.\nFortunately, it was relatively easy to fool jadeless councilmen. They mistook\nhis moments of weakness for authoritative pauses. “For years, Kekon has\nbeen fortunate to enjoy stability and economic growth,” Lan continued. “We\nhave foreign investment, people drive nice cars, our cities are booming—all\nthings that my grandfather’s generation couldn’t have imagined. At the heart\nof this wealth and security is jade. Which means that the clans who control\njade must be held accountable.”\nThe councilmen nodded; this was a point on which they could all agree.\nOne of them, Vang Hajuda, began to say something, but Lan’s Perception\nbegan playing tricks on him—it turned abruptly white with background noise.\nThe individual energies of the people in the room, combined with hundreds\nmore on all the floors beneath them, all the way down to the thousands more\nwalking on the busy street and driving past in the cars outside, all crowded"

He felt, for a second, as if he were\ndangling high in the air atop a column of nothing but meaningless energy\nbabble. Under the table, he gripped one of his chair’s armrests, hanging on to\nits reassuring solidity. Lan turned away and brought a hand up to shield his\nlips as he leaned over to Woon, sitting directly on his left. “Pretend to be\ntelling me something,” he whispered.\nHis Pillarman bent next to his ear worriedly. “Is it really bad this time,\nLan-jen? Do we need to make an excuse to leave?”\n“No,” said Lan. Sweat had broken out on his brow, but the moment was\nalready passing. The feverish confusion of his jade senses receded. His\nPerception settled and grew focused again. “Just tell me what he said.”\n“He wants assurances there won’t be more bloodshed.”\nLan straightened to face the table just as Vang finished asking a question.\n“I apologize for the interruption,” Lan said.\nThere was a minor ripple of consternation down the table; they were\nwatching him closely. Vang repeated himself with a touch of pique. “If we\nbring these issues you’ve placed before us to the Royal Council, can we\ncount on you, Kaul-jen, to try to reestablish the peace between the clans? No\none wants violence on the streets, frightening people and driving away\nforeign business.”\n“We all want peace,” Lan said. He let his words hang as he wetted his\nmouth with a bit of tea. “Unless our families are attacked. Then we do what\nwe must.”\nA number of the councilmen murmured in agreement. They were a\nstrange breed, these politicians. As representatives of their districts, they\npressured the Pillar for peace, but as clan loyalists and true Kekonese, they\nwould never respect a leader unskilled or hesitant in dispensing violence. Lan\nkilling Gam and wearing his jade gave them confidence in him as a leader\nand confidence in No Peak’s assertions. They would return to Wisdom Hall\nand work toward the purpose he’d set them.\n“We understand perfectly where you’re coming from, Kaul-jen,” Vang\npersisted. He represented an area of Janloon that included the contested\nterritory of Sogen. “You’ve always come across as a reasonable man. But\nwhat about your Horn? Does he also want peace? Can we count on him to\nalso be reasonable?”\nLan laid a flat stare on Vang. “The Horn answers to me.”\nAdmonished, Vang fell silent. The Pillar drew his gaze slowly up and\ndown the long table of faces. When no one questioned him further, he rose\nfrom his seat. “Stay as long as you like, my friends. Enjoy the tea, and the\nview.” He nodded toward the expansive windows looking out over the\ndowntown skyline before turning back to the table. “Chancellor. Councilmen."

Councilmen.\nYour friendship to the clan, and your service to the country are, as always,\ndeeply appreciated.”\nOnce in the elevator, Lan mopped his brow and leaned against the wall,\nexhausted. He’d kept it together, but just barely. Dr. Truw had told him that\nhis kie—the essential aura-producing energy of each individual that could be\namplified and manipulated by contact with jade—was damaged, like an\noverstrained muscle. It might be weeks, even months until it fully recovered.\nLan did not have the luxury of months. He couldn’t afford to continue like\nthis, with his jade tolerance and abilities handicapped, not with so much at\nstake. “Woon,” he said, putting a hand on the Pillarman’s arm. “I’ve always\nbeen grateful I can trust you. I have to ask something of you now that you\nmust keep to yourself. You can’t let it slip even within the family.”\nWoon regarded him with concern. “Lan-jen, I’ll do whatever you require\nof me.”\nLan nodded. “I need you to make a phone call.”\nCHAPTER\n27\nMistakes Revealed\nS\nhae sat quietly in the back row of the slow bus to Marenia, staring out the\nwindow and avoiding conversation while the tourists chatted and took photos\nout the open windows all along the scenic coastal highway. When she arrived\nin town, she found her mother walking on the beach behind the family’s\ncottage. Her mother seemed neither surprised nor especially excited to see\nher. Perhaps Lan had called her already to tell her to expect Shae’s visit. Kaul\nWan Ria embraced her daughter warmly but briefly, as if she’d last seen Shae\na month ago, instead of more than two years ago.\n“We can stroll the beach and then have some tea,” Shae’s mother\nsuggested. “If we walk an hour that way, there is a very nice teahouse. The\nowners are very nice.” These days, she told Shae, she took long walks,\ngardened, watched television, and attended a class in watercolor landscape\npainting at the community recreation center. Shae ought to try it sometime. It\nwas very restful.\nThe seaside town of Marenia held ten thousand inhabitants and was a far\ncry from the ceaseless activity of the city. Shae found that it was just what\nshe needed to set herself at ease again, to escape the confusion she’d felt after\nbeing around her brothers, who were, she knew, now engaged in a clan war\nwithout her.\nIn the evenings, Shae practiced alone with the moon blade behind the\ncottage, the long expanse of wet sand a spongy black sheet under her bare\nfeet, the roar of the ocean replacing the hum of traffic from her balcony in\nJanloon. In the morning, fresh-fish stands sold the dawn’s catch, surfers rode\nthe warm swells, and people said hello to each other in the streets. No one\nwas a Green Bone.\nIt was like when she’d been in Espenia. What a disquieting revelation it\nhad been to live in a place that functioned perfectly fine without jade and\nwithout clans.

The two things that all the men in Shae’s family worshipped,\nthat she’d been taught her whole life to hold above all else—other places did\nwithout them. Clan patronage and settling disputes through duels were seen\nas backward things. Green Bones were thought of as something exotic and\nmagical, but ultimately archaic and savage. It was Jerald, really, who’d\nopened her eyes to the wider world; sometimes Shae was not sure whether to\nthank or blame him for it. Two years abroad had given her a perspective on\nher home country that she doubted most Green Bones possessed. Her college\nfriends in Espenia could never understand Kekon; they would be bewildered\nby its apparent contradictions, by the seamless blend of modernity and casual\nbrutality.\nShae found Marenia charming but her mother’s company depressing.\nKaul Wan Ria was like a piece of artwork or furniture that blended in with\nthe rest of a house and went unnoticed. Before she’d been married off, she’d\nreceived a basic education and enough martial training to be able to tolerate\njade contact but not enough to actually wear or use it. After her husband’s\ndeath, she deferred to her father-in-law, and later to her eldest son. If she\nbegrudged her place, it never showed. If she found her life now to be dull or\nlonely, that didn’t show either. Shae watched her stirring a pot of soup on the\nstove; her mother had put on some weight and her hair was graying.\n“The boys are always very busy,” Ria said over her shoulder. “Lan comes\nto visit me sometimes. Hilo—only once. To show me his girlfriend. A very\nnice, polite girl, but a stone-eye.” Shae’s mother tugged on her right earlobe.\n“Still, it’s his choice, so long as he’s happy and his brother agrees.” She\nturned the stove off and moved the pot to the table. “They’ve been in fights,\ndid you know that? Both of them! Hilo of course—always fighting—but Lan\nsaid he had to duel as well because of the disrespect to the family. So\nunfortunate.” She clucked her tongue, as if the Pillar and the Horn of No\nPeak were small boys who’d been implicated in a schoolyard brawl. No\ndoubt Lan sanitized the things he told her, but still, Shae wondered if her\nmother preferred to be willfully ignorant about what was going on in the clan,\nor if, growing up during wartime, she’d long ago accepted such violence as\nthe casual norm for all men.\n“I made it extra spicy, the way you like it,” said her mother, ladling out\nthe soup. “I’ve heard the food in Espenia is not very good. What did you eat\nthere?”\nHer mother listened as Shae told her about Espenia. They discussed\nsuperficial things like the food, weather, and clothes. Kaul Wan Ria didn’t\nask about Jerald. She didn’t inquire as to why Shae had returned, or what she\nwas doing now. She did not even remark on Shae not wearing her jade, other\nthan to sigh, “Ah, you worked so hard for it before.

As long as your brother doesn’t think it’ll look\nbad for the family.” As a general rule, she avoided asking prying questions or\nexpressing strong opinions. As a child, Shae had gone to her mother for\ncomfort, but never for advice. Indeed, she could think of little she had in\ncommon with her mother besides their eyes and somewhat mannish hands.\n“Do you like it here, Ma?” Shae asked. “Are you happy?”\n“Oh, yes,” said her mother. “You and your brothers are grown up. There’s\nno need for me to be around Green Bone troubles anymore. Men cannot\nescape it, of course, it’s in their nature—but you took off your jade and went\nto live far away, so you understand.”\nShe was not sure she did; even now, she couldn’t say if she’d run toward\nJerald and the enticing modern world beyond Janloon simply to escape the\nsting of her grandfather’s displeasure—the humiliation of seeing him, for the\nfirst time, openly side with Hilo against her.\nOn top of his extreme ire over Jerald, Kaul Sen had been furious to learn\nof her involvement with the Espenians. “At least whores only sell what\nbelongs to them!” he’d raged. He’d never spoken to her in such a way, had\nalways been kind and approving toward her even when he was stern. Only a\nfew years out of the Academy, she’d been young, arrogant, and disaffected,\nand not thought her actions to be harmful. Jerald, when he came to\nunderstand her family’s position, had introduced her to some other Espenian\nmilitary personnel who were eager to ask her questions.\nAt first, they were simple questions that Shae knew the answers to or\ncould discover easily through the clan’s connections. The Espenians were\nkeen to expand their political and economic influence, but they were\nuninformed about how things worked on Kekon. They wanted to know:\nWhich clan leaders comprised the board of the KJA? When did they meet and\nwho held sway over the jade export decisions? Who on the Royal Council\nwas responsible for military spending? How could they secure a meeting with\nthis person and what sort of gift would be appropriate to send?\nWhat they were most interested in, however, were their enemies. Ygutan\n—less advanced, but with vast land and population and growing military\nstrength—was the one rival the Espenians seemed to fear. Even here, on a\nsmall island so far away, they were on the watch. They wanted to know what\ninvestments Ygutanian companies were making on Kekon. How much jade\nthe clans believed was being smuggled to Ygutan through the black market.\nCould Shae ask around and find out why a certain supposed Ygutanian\nbusinessman was on Kekon?

Shae was more impressed by the student visa\nthey agreed to arrange for her so that she might study abroad. An Espenian\neducation was something few people on Kekon had; it would be even more\nimpressive than graduating at the top of the Academy, would set her above\nand apart from her brothers. In the meantime, she was helping ignorant\nforeigners do business in Kekon, and in truth, she took a secret pride in it. It\nwas something outside of the clan that was hers entirely. Information and\nrelationships that belonged to her, not her grandfather, or her brothers, or\nDoru.\n“How can you call yourself a Kaul, you selfish idiot girl?” her grandfather\nhad demanded. “Anything you tell the foreigners might be used against the\nclan.” The Torch had wielded all his considerable influence, had made angry\nphone calls to the Espenian ambassador, who gave apologetic assurances to\nKaul Sen that his granddaughter would not be approached by anyone from\nthe Republic of Espenia’s military or intelligence services again. Jerald was\nshipped back to Espenia, and Shae, burning with the indignity of Grandda\nswooping in to set her right, had followed him. She’d been a fool, but sadly,\neven fools were entitled to their pride.\nShae returned to Janloon feeling calmer and more rested, but also determined\nto rededicate herself to the job search and find meaningful employment as\nsoon as possible. There was really nothing, she mused, that motivated her\nquite so much as the abiding fear of becoming like her mother. If she had her\nown work to occupy her, she wouldn’t spend time the way she spent it on the\nbus ride back to the city, speculating on what Lan and Woon would do with\nthe damning financial information she had furnished them, or wondering\nwhen the Mountain would try to kill Hilo again.\nShe got back to her apartment and groaned aloud to discover that she’d\nleft her keys on the kitchen counter at her mother’s cottage. She was locked\nout of her place.\nShae left her bag sitting in the hallway by her door and went over to her\nneighbor Caun Yu’s, hoping to use his phone to call the landlord. No one\nanswered when she knocked. There was a pile of flyers in front of the door\nthat suggested Caun had been absent for several days. She went back outside\nand climbed the metal fire escape stairs, intending to force a way back into\nher own apartment, but upon passing her neighbor’s window, she stopped and\nstared.\nCaun’s apartment was almost empty. It was clear that no one lived in it.\nThere was a small television on the floor and a telephone sitting on top of the\ntelevision. There was a sleeping bag and a couple of cushions on the floor,\nbut nothing else—no furniture, no clothes, nothing on the walls, no sign of\nCaun himself.\nShae began to tremble with suspicion and outrage. She pushed open the\nwindow and clambered into her neighbor’s apartment. It was laid out almost\nexactly like hers.

The fridge\ncontained only a few bottles of soda. Caun had supposedly been living here\nfor as long as she had—nearly four months—but he had never moved in.\nShae went into the bare living room and sat down on one of the cushions\nto wait. She suspected it would not be long before Caun made an appearance,\nand sure enough, perhaps an hour later, the front door opened and the young\nman walked in, his accumulated junk mail gathered under one arm. He\nstopped in astonishment when he saw Shae sitting inside his apartment.\nBefore Caun could recover his wits, Shae got up and moved past him,\nshutting and locking the door. Turning around, she drew her talon knife and\nadvanced. The young man backed up, licking his lips nervously, his eyes on\nthe knife. His back touched the wall. Shae reached up with her free hand and\npulled off the black skullcap Caun always wore. The man’s short hair was\nmessy and flattened, and the tops of both ears were pierced through with jade\nstuds. Not much jade, not enough for her to notice an aura unless she was\ntouching him.\nShae took a step back and pointed to the phone. “Call him,” she said.\n“Tell him to come over here right now.”\nCaun picked up the receiver and dialed, his eyes darting fearfully. Shae\ndoubted it was her or her knife that made him anxious; it was his boss’s\nreaction he was worried about. “Hilo-jen,” Caun said after some minutes of\nbeing passed around on the other end of the line, “it’s Caun Yu. Your sister\n… she, er, told me to phone you. She’s holding a talon knife on me and wants\nyou to come over here.”\nThere was a moment of silence, and then Shae caught a snatch of her\nbrother’s laughter coming from the other end of the phone line. More words\nwere exchanged, and then Caun hung up. “He says he’s finishing up\nsomething, but he’ll come soon.”\n“Security, was it, Caun-jen?” Shae said. “You work in security. In a rather\nboring job, if I recall. One you’ve been hoping to get out of soon.”\n“I didn’t mean it in that way,” Caun explained, reddening. “It’s not that I\nthink you’re boring. It’s just that keeping watch over you isn’t all that\nexciting, you know.”\n“No, I don’t suppose it would be.” Her sudden odd sense of hurt and\namusement came out as a cold smirk. “And here I was, starting to think all\nour meetings were because you were working up to hitting on me.”\n“Touch the Horn’s little sister?” Caun let out a nervous bark of laughter.\n“Come on, put the talon knife away. Don’t you think you’ve pulled it on me\nenough lately? It doesn’t seem very charitable, considering that I’m supposed\nto be protecting you.” Caun seemed to be in a surprisingly good mood.

Shae suspected that Hilo’s reaction on\nthe phone had reassured Caun that he was not in as much trouble as he’d\nfeared, and now he was looking forward to the end of this undesirable\nassignment.\nShae sheathed her knife. “So you’ve been camped here, following me\naround.”\n“I’m supposed to watch you when you’re out and about.” He nudged the\nsleeping bag on the floor with his foot. “I used to slip out the window in the\nevening and be back in the morning before you left, but now the Horn says I\nhave to be here whenever you are.” Caun backed into the kitchen and came\nout with the sleeve of crackers and two bottles of mango soda. “Do you want\nsome? It’s all I have, I’m afraid. Or we could go wait in your place instead.”\nShae gave him a dirty look and Caun shrugged, opening his soda.\nHilo arrived perhaps twenty minutes later. He knocked on the door and\ncalled, cheerily, “Shae, you haven’t hurt poor Caun Yu, have you? I told him\nthere were risks involved with this job.”\nWhen Shae flung open the door, her brother stepped inside, smiling, and\nmade to give her a hug. She shoved him back violently. “You’ve had me\nwatched and followed all this time,” she hissed.\nInstead of answering, the Horn straightened the shirt Shae had rumpled\nand turned to Caun, shaking his head. His voice turned harsh. “Gods in\nHeaven, this was the easiest job a Finger could get, Caun. Where and how did\nyou fuck up?”\nCaun’s smile vanished at once. “I … I don’t know, Hilo-jen,” he\nstammered. “The doorman called to say she’d returned from Marenia. I came\nstraight here, but she got into the apartment and was waiting for me when I\narrived. I’m sorry I failed you.” The young man bent into an apologetic\nsalute.\nHilo sighed deeply, looking around the bare apartment. “It’s hard to fool\nmy sister for long, but you should’ve done a better job of it. Go report to\nMaik Kehn—I’m sure he could use you in the Docks. You might even get a\nchance to earn some green over there, if you concentrate harder on not\nfucking up from now on.” He opened the door in dismissal and Caun exited\nquickly with his eyes lowered. Hilo did not lose his stern expression, but he\ngave the Finger a single pat on the back as he passed, and the young man\nglanced up with a nervously grateful expression. In one unfortunate instant,\nShae’s perception of Caun transformed. Her friendly, attractive next-door\nneighbor was just another one of her brother’s many underlings. She was\nbothered by how much it aggravated her that Caun did not even spare her a\nparting glance as he left the room.\nShae wheeled back on Hilo. “Stay out of my life.”\n“You’re flattering yourself, Shae.

Don’t blame me.”\n“Lan told you to set a guard over me?” Shae was taken aback. Hilo having\nher watched made her nearly speechless with ire, but she had never known\nLan to be anything but prudent and well-intentioned. Some of her anger\ndiffused into uncertainty. “What happened to Anden?”\n“Gont Asch snatched Andy out of Summer Park on Boat Day, took him to\nAyt, and made a show of trying to turn him while offering us a sham alliance\nto make and sell shine in Ygutan with them. They gave Andy back, but they\nmade their point. They shook us up, and they insulted Lan. He turned them\ndown flat. So they tried to take me out of the picture, and here we are.”\nShae shook her head. She didn’t want to admit to being unfair to either of\nher brothers, particularly Hilo. “I didn’t know about Anden. No one told me.”\nHilo gave an incredulous and condescending snort. “What do you expect,\nShae? You came back to Janloon, but you’re living out here jadeless like you\nwant nothing to do with us. You made me search you out in a hotel and then\ntreated me like a stranger. You haven’t gone to visit Andy, you haven’t seen\nany friends from the Academy. You didn’t even go out of your way to come\nover and pay a bit of respect to Tar when he was in the hospital. You’ve\nnever once invited me into your place, not even now when we’re standing in\nthe apartment next door. What’s that supposed to mean, huh?” There was true\nbewilderment and hurt in his voice. “What are you even doing these days,\nanyhow?”\nShae felt her temper rising anew. “I spent weeks doing that work for Lan,\nremember? And I’ve been applying for jobs. I have interviews coming up.”\n“Interviews,” Hilo repeated with dripping disdain. “For what? You’re\ngoing to work as a suit in a bank? Why? I don’t understand you, Shae.”\nShae’s face burned. “I don’t need your advice, Hilo. Or your protection.”\n“No, you didn’t, never before. But now we’re at war with the Mountain,\nand you’re still acting like you’ve nothing to do with any of it. You’re\nignoring that you’re a Kaul.” Hilo advanced, his face tight, his voice edged\nwith a vexed desperation. “I’ve got news for my tough little sister who thinks\nshe’s too good for her family. Lan won’t come out and say it, but I will: You\ncan’t be an ordinary person, Shae. Not in this city. Not in this country.

        "text": "don’t like being kept in the dark, secretly guarded and treated like some\nhelpless woman? Well, you put yourself there.”\nThere had been a day, almost ten years ago, Shae remembered, when she\nand Hilo had squared off, spitting fire as they’d done many times before, and\nrealized at the same moment that they were both wearing jade now and could\nfatally harm each other. They had stayed themselves on that day, and it was\nperhaps only this memory, and the knowledge that Hilo was wearing a great\ndeal of jade and she carried none, that kept Shae from launching herself at her\nbrother now.\n“Say whatever you want to Lan,” she said, her voice cold to hide all\nemotion, “but I don’t want to see any of your men around my apartment or\nfollowing me, ever again. Risk your own life how you like, Hilo—but leave\nme alone to live mine.”\nShe caught a glimpse of her brother’s stricken expression as she pushed\npast him out the door. She remembered, only at the last minute, that she was\nstill locked outside of her apartment, but too proud to be seen struggling to\nget inside, she left the building and sat in misery at a tea shop down the street\nuntil it was dark.\nWhen she returned, Hilo was gone, but the landlord was waiting for her,\nholding her bag and a spare key. “Kaul-jen said to make sure you returned\nhome safely, miss,” he said, saluting her solicitously. “I must apologize\nprofusely for not realizing who you are. Please, from now on, if there is\nanything you need, you should call me directly.” As he unlocked Shae’s door,\nhe turned over his shoulder and inquired, “Are you sure you’re quite\ncomfortable here? I have another property, a new one, only ten minutes away,\nrun by my son-in-law, where the units are much larger. The rent would be the\nsame for you, of course. No? Well, don’t hesitate to let me know if you\nchange your mind. My family and I have always been friends of the clan.”\nCHAPTER\n28\nDeliveries and Secrets\nA\nnden had a bad feeling about the errand the Pillar had sent him on. It was\nsimple enough; Lan had phoned him to inquire when his next free afternoon\nfrom the Academy would be. He wanted Anden to come see him. Could he\nplease stop by a certain address on the way over and pick up a package and\nbring it to his cousin?\nAnden agreed, of course, but this was now the second time Lan had asked\nhim for the same favor, and that seemed odd. The Pillar had any number of\nsubordinates he could send to pick up parcels. For him to ask Anden once\nmight have been random convenience. Twice made Anden suspect he’d been\nsingled out for the task.\nThe address was for a walk-up apartment just down the hill from the\nAcademy at the edge of the Crossyards district. When Anden rang the\ndoorbell, a man in baggy camouflage pants and a yellowed muscle shirt\nopened the door. “You again?” He had green eyes and might have been\nEspenian, though he spoke Kekonese without an accent. Anden couldn’t\ndecipher either the graffiti-style tattoos on his arms or the jangling music"

Anden couldn’t\ndecipher either the graffiti-style tattoos on his arms or the jangling music\ncoming from the interior of the apartment. It was not particularly uncommon\nto see foreigners in Janloon, and becoming less so all the time, but\nencountering them always caused Anden some discomfort; he knew that must\nbe how he looked to those around him. So he did not greet this man with\nanything beyond a polite nod.\n“Wait here.” The stranger closed the door, leaving Anden standing\nawkwardly on the landing. A few minutes later, the door reopened and the\nman handed Anden an unmarked white padded envelope. Anden took it and\nzipped it up inside his schoolbag. Lan had told him to keep it out of sight, not\nto open it, and not to tell anyone about it.\nHe rode his bike to the transit station where he caught the bus to the Kaul\nhome. That was another thing—there were faster methods of delivery than a\nstudent with no car. Anden could only conclude that the Pillar was trusting\nhim with a confidential task he didn’t want anyone else in the clan to know\nabout. He would’ve been flattered, but instead he was worried. Lan had never\nasked him for anything before, other than to do well at the Academy. He\ndidn’t think the Pillar would involve him in a secret errand for the clan unless\nhe had no one else he could trust to do it.\nOn the bus, he reached into his schoolbag and felt the envelope, trying to\nguess at what was in it. It was well cushioned, but when he pushed on the\nbubble wrap, he could tell there were small, hard objects inside.\nHe got off the bus and walked ten minutes to the gates of the Kaul estate.\nThe guard waved to him as he went straight through and into the house.\n“Hello?” he called in the foyer. Kyanla called back from the kitchen,\nclattering dishes. “Anden-se, is that you? Lan-jen is in the training hall.”\nAnden wandered past the Pillar’s study, through the tidy courtyard, and\nrapped on the door to the training hall. Lan slid the door open. He was in a\nloose black tunic shirt, trousers, and bare feet. It was strange to see him\nlooking so casual. It made him seem younger, the way Anden remembered\nhim from before he’d become the Pillar. “Anden.” Lan stepped aside,\nsmiling. “Come in.” Anden slipped off his shoes and entered the long, wood-\nfloored room. Lan slid the door closed. “Do you have what I asked you to\npick up?”\nAnden swung his schoolbag off his shoulder and took out the padded\nenvelope. As he handed it over, his fingers passed close to Lan’s and he\nflinched. He still wasn’t used to the difference in his cousin’s aura. He knew\nhe was more sensitive than the average person—most people could not sense\njade auras unless they were trained Green Bones wearing jade themselves. To\nAnden, the new jade Lan had won in the duel made his aura seem\nincongruously sharp and shrill, as if it had been taken up several psychic\noctaves. It didn’t suit him.\n“I appreciate you going out of your way,” Lan said."

Lan took a towel from a\nhook on the wall and wiped the sheen of sweat from his face. “How’s\nschool?”\n“Fine. Only a few months left.”\n“Do you feel ready for the Trials?”\n“I think so.”\nLan turned away and tossed the towel into a bin by the door. “What’s your\nstrongest discipline?”\n“Channeling, probably.”\nLan nodded. “Your weakest?”\n“Um. Deflection, I suppose.”\n“How are your academics? Math, and languages, and so on?”\n“I’m passing all of them.” Anden skirted barely above average in the book\nstudy aspects of a Green Bone education. “Don’t worry, Lan-jen, they won’t\npull my final rank down much.”\nLan said, a touch sternly, “I’m not worried about your rank, Anden. I’m\nasking about school because I’m sure there’s a lot of talk on campus these\ndays about the clans. You’re bound to hear a lot of rumors and opinions, if\nyou haven’t already. I don’t want you to feel upset or distracted by it; just\nfocus on your own studies.”\n“I will,” Anden promised.\nLan gave Anden an approving pat on the shoulder and gestured at the\nempty training hall. “Well, since we’re in here, how about some Deflection\npractice?”\nAnden tried to think of a good excuse to decline. He didn’t relish the idea\nof being put on the spot with the Pillar of No Peak watching him, but Lan\nwas already crossing to the other side of the room and taking a set of darts\nfrom the shelf.\n“You have your training band with you?” Lan asked.\nAnden laid his schoolbag next to the wall. It’s just Lan. He wants to be\nhelpful; he’s not going to make me feel bad. Hilo and Shae were like true\ncousins to him, but Lan was much older and had always been more like an\nuncle. Anden dug around in the front compartment of his bag and pulled out\nthe plastic case containing his training band. As a year-eight, he was allowed\nto carry it at all times and to use it under the supervision of an adult Green\nBone. It was a simple leather band with a snap closure and three jade stones.\nIf he kept his scores up, he could expect to get four in the spring.\nAnden fastened it around his left wrist, closed his eyes, and took a deep\nbreath. Every time he put on jade, he felt, just for a second, the moment of\nresistance that one feels before jumping off a high diving board or ripping off\na sticky bandage. An instant of ah, this is going to hurt—and then it was\ndone. He rode out the initial rush of adjustment, opened his eyes, and went to\nstand across the room, facing Lan.\nLan finished loading the darts into a dart gun. “Easy warm up,” he said."

Anden Deflected each one, and\nthey sunk into the corkboard-covered wall behind him. Darts were light and\nmoved slowly. Deflection became exponentially more difficult with faster\nspeeds, heavier items, and multiple objects. Lan moved on to the pellet gun,\nwhich Anden didn’t find too hard—throwing up faster, wider Deflections was\nnot a problem for him—but he labored with throwing knives, especially two\nor more from different directions.\n“Maintain control of them,” Lan said. “Slingshot them around and make\nthem your weapons.”\nAnden nodded, though he’d heard the same advice from his Deflection\ninstructor a hundred times and was still not anywhere near as capable as he\nwished he was. When he Deflected the knives, they lost momentum and\nsailed into the ground behind him. Ideally, he could whip them accurately\nanywhere into the wall, or even, as Lan said, around his own body like a\nboomerang and back out with even greater speed. Anden rocked on the balls\nof his feet, shaking out his limbs, trying to stay relaxed and focused and not\nthink about how he was disappointing his cousin.\n“Ready?” Lan whipped another knife at him—nice and straight—and\nAnden swept his arm out in a tight, arcing Deflection. He felt it catch the\nknife and veer the weapon off course. Straining, he kept the momentum of\nthe Deflection going as he pivoted tightly, and with a surge of effort, he\ncircled it around himself and flung the knife back out toward Lan.\nIt didn’t go far before it curved toward the ground, but Lan raised a\nDeflection of his own and straightened it out. He lunged and caught the knife\nout of the air. “Nicely done!” His face lit with a pride that made Anden\nwarm. “Most new Green Bones aren’t able to do that. Keep practicing and\nyou’ll ace the Trials.”\n“I hope so,” Anden said weakly. He put his hands on his knees and bent\nover to catch his breath. Lan filled a paper cup with water from the cooler in\nthe corner and brought it to him. Anden took it gratefully, but was struck\nagain by the harsh texture of the Pillar’s aura. The jade fastened around his\nwrist made it worse, much louder. He nearly pulled away.\nThankfully, his cousin crossed the room again and opened a storage\ncabinet. He rolled out half a dozen large plastic pop bottles filled with sand,\nthe lids sealed with silver duct tape. Lan set them up like an array of bowling\npins. “We shouldn’t neglect offense,” he said. Anden’s stomach sank a little.\nOffensive Deflection was his weakest area, and Lan was watching him from\nthe side of the room with an expression that seemed unusually expectant.\nHe’d always taken an interest in Anden’s progress, but he’d never been pushy\nor demanding.

He reset the bottles. “Try again.”\nThe bottles were heavy, the training hall was long, and Anden was losing\nsteam. His second try toppled three bottles in a row, but that took the rest of\nthe wind out of him. His third Deflection barely tipped over one bottle, and\nhis fourth merely nudged it out of place.\nLan said, “Come on, Anden, you’re not really trying now.”\n“I’m sorry,” Anden said. “I’m just tired.” He’d already been to advanced\nStrength training in the morning, which was always exhausting. He hadn’t\nknown his visit to the Kaul house would result in an impromptu exam.\nLan snapped, “Do you expect to use that excuse in a life-or-death\nsituation? Do it again.”\nAnden tried to muster the energy. He rooted more firmly into his stance\nand raised both hands, feeling them tingle and quiver with tension, then thrust\nthem down and forward with as powerful an expulsion of breath and energy\nas he could summon. His Deflection tore across the room but went wide,\nrattling the cabinet doors as if they were in an earthquake. The bottles did not\nbudge.\nLan rubbed a hand over his eyes. “If you can’t knock over a bottle full of\nsand, how are you going to throw a man off his feet? Or defend yourself if\nsomeone tries to do it to you?”\n“I’m not a Green Bone yet,” Anden protested, slumping apologetically.\n“I’ll practice harder; I’ve still got some time.”\n“You’ll only be a student for a few more months.” Lan’s face hardened\nand his voice rose abruptly. “The Mountain’s already shown that they’re\npaying attention to you, Anden. They’ve tried to kill both Hilo and me, and\nwhen you’re no longer protected by the code of aisho, your life will be up for\nthe taking as well, by enemies with far more jade and experience. You can’t\nbe too tired or weak to defend yourself, ever!”\nWith one arm, Lan hurled a funnel of Deflection across the room,\nthrowing the bottles into the air. They crashed into the back wall and thudded\nto the ground, rolling on the floor. Lan didn’t even look at them. He strode\nover and seized Anden by the arm, hauling him up straight. The Pillar’s voice\nwas a low growl. “You’re graduating into a war, Anden. You have to be\nready for what it means to be a Kaul, or you won’t survive. Understand?”\nAnden gasped. The Pillar’s fingers dug into his bicep, but the pain came\nfrom elsewhere, right through the center of Anden’s skull. So much jade\nbehind Lan’s unfamiliar anger—it startled the breath from Anden’s chest.\n“Kaul-jen,” he pleaded. He stared into eyes he barely recognized.

The web of thin red blood vessels surrounding them stood out. Anden\nswallowed. “Lan?”\nThe Pillar let go, abruptly, almost shoving Anden back. Lan stared for a\nsecond, then shook his head as if to clear it. His jade aura churned, and\nAnden, without even trying, Perceived the Pillar’s stark anger crash into a\nmuddy jumble of indecipherable emotions. Lan pressed the heels of his hands\nto his eyes, then lowered them and said, more calmly, “I’m sorry, Anden.\nYou didn’t deserve that.”\n“It’s okay.” Anden’s voice was a dull, stunned whisper.\n“I’ve been short-tempered lately.” Lan turned away. “There’s been a lot to\ndeal with, and so much teetering on the edge. We need to keep the Royal\nCouncil and the Lantern Men on our side, and we have to consider the\npossibility that the Espenians might get involved …” He glanced,\ninexplicably, at Anden for understanding. He still seemed not quite himself,\nthough he was trying hard to be. “No matter. I was too hard on you just now.”\n“No.” Anden was confused, still reeling. “What you said is true.”\n“I am proud of you, Anden; I haven’t said it enough.” Lan came back\ntoward him. “Hilo has you pegged for a Fist. With your talent, you’d be an\nasset to him. But I want you to know it’s your choice. With things as they are\nnow, you might consider other roles in No Peak, or even choosing a path\noutside of the clan.”\nAnden had no response at first. Then his bewilderment flared into\ndefensiveness, and his face turned hot. “I’m not a coward.” He knew he\ndidn’t have the book smarts to be a Luckbringer. There were Green Bones\noutside of the clan—teachers, doctors, penitents—but how could he consider\nprofessions like that in a time like this? “Hilo-jen told me you need as many\nGreen Bones coming out of the Academy as you can get. I owe everything to\nthe clan, to you and Grandda. What kind of person would I be if I didn’t take\nmy oaths?”\nBefore Lan could answer, there was a sharp knock at the training room\ndoor. Woon’s voice came through. “Lan-jen, it’s the mayor of Janloon on the\nphone.”\nLan glanced toward his Pillarman’s voice, then back at Anden. He stepped\naway, his expression unreadable. For a second, Anden’s mind prickled\nuncomfortably with the Perception of some urgent desperation. “I’m sorry,\nAnden, we’ll talk about this more later.” He began to turn toward the door.\n“If you wait in the courtyard for a few minutes, I’ll have someone drive you\nback to the Academy.”\n“No, it’s fine,” Anden said. “I can see myself out. I have to go back to the\ntransit station for my bike, and I don’t mind the bus ride.”\nLan paused with his hand on the door and spoke somberly over his"

        "text": "transit station for my bike, and I don’t mind the bus ride.”\nLan paused with his hand on the door and spoke somberly over his\nshoulder. “I would never suggest you’re a coward, Anden. I only wanted to\nmake it clear that you do have a choice. And no matter what you chose,\nyou’ll always be a Kaul, same as Shae.” The Pillar slid the door open and\nfollowed Woon back toward the main house, his overly sharp aura receding\nalong with the shape of his stiff back.\nAnden let out a shaky breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. What\nhad happened? He had never seen Lan’s mood swing in such a way before,\nfrom warmth to anger to doubt and remorse. Was it the recent stress and new\njade that was making him so volatile? Did Lan really think Anden wasn’t\nready to join the clan? It was one thing for Anden to doubt himself privately,\nor to speculate idly on what he might do if he wasn’t already pegged to\nbecome a Fist; it was quite another to have the Pillar of the clan suggest such\nunhelpful thoughts to his face. Was it simply due to his poor performance in\nDeflection today, or something else?\nTurning aside, Anden took off his training band and leaned his forehead\nagainst the wall. The jade crash made his anxious stomach flip worse than\nusual. He sucked in a steadying breath and forced down the sensation as he\nshut the band back in its plastic case and pushed it into his bag.\nBefore leaving the training room, Anden collected the scattered bottles\nfull of sand and stored them back in the cabinet. He gathered the throwing\nknives and pulled the darts out of the wall and returned them to their proper\nplace as well. The Academy was military in its insistence on orderliness. The\nDeflections he and Lan had thrown had shaken cabinet doors ajar; Anden\nshut them carefully and was about to push a loose drawer back into place\nwhen he paused, his fingers hovering over the slim crack that showed him the\nwhite padded envelope he’d brought with him, the one Lan had taken and\nshut away without explanation.\nAnden opened the drawer and took out the package. As he stared at it, an\nawful temptation ballooned into an even more awful suspicion. Anden’s heart\nbegan to pound. He glanced around the empty, tidy training room. If he\nopened the package, Lan would know he’d done so. There was a small space,\nhowever, between the envelope seal and the corner of the flap. Anden pulled\nit open a little larger. He turned the envelope upside down and shook it,\nworking two fingers under the flap until he touched something smooth and\nhard, like glass. His hands trembling now, he wriggled out a tiny cylindrical\nvial of cloudy white liquid.\nHe knew what it was. What else could it be? Anden’s heart dropped into\nhis feet. He tore open the hole in the envelope, recklessly pulling out vial\nafter vial of the stuff.\nHis mind spun. It was as he’d feared, and still he couldn’t believe it.\nThe door of the room opened. Lan stood in the doorway. Anden’s hands\nfell open; he dropped the envelope and its contents into the open drawer, but\nhis guilt was clear. So was Lan’s; angry shame flooded the Pillar’s face."

So was Lan’s; angry shame flooded the Pillar’s face.\nAnden was sure that if he’d still been wearing his training band, he wouldn’t\nhave been able to stand the furious blaze of his cousin’s aura.\nLan stepped inside and closed the door behind him. It scraped shut with a\nnoise like a blade on a whetstone. “What are you doing, Anden?” Lan’s voice\nwas deceptively monotone.\n“You had me pick this up for you. It’s SN1.” Anden’s words sounded\nchoked. He felt the need to hold on to something to steady himself. “How …\nhow could you need shine?”\nLan advanced and Anden, without meaning to, backed away until his\nshoulders touched the wall. “You had no right to open that package.” Lan had\nnever beaten him before, had never so much as struck him, but now he\nlooked murderous, and Anden felt, for the first time in his life, a flash of fear\nin his cousin’s presence. He would rather be smacked around a dozen times\nby Hilo than know he’d infuriated Lan enough to hit him once. Of course, he\ndeserved to be beaten now, and not even thinking to say anything in his own\ndefense, Anden could only blurt, “You’re not sick, are you? With … with the\nItches?”\nThe despair on his face must have been so plain—for in that moment, he\nimagined Lan dying the sort of death his mother had died, cutting his own\nflesh and screaming with insanity—that it dispelled the Pillar’s rage. Lan’s\nface changed, twisted with internal strain. He raised a hand and kept it there,\nas if to say, Hold on now. “Keep your voice down,” he said, harshly but more\ncalmly than Anden expected, the undercurrent of anger held in check this\ntime. “No, I don’t have the Itches. By the time a person has a full-blown case\nof the Itches, it’s usually too late for SN1 to save them.” Sympathy rose in his\neyes as he realized what Anden had been thinking, but his voice remained\nhard. “I ought to throw you out of the house for what you just did. I wouldn’t\nhave believed it of you, Anden. But I don’t want you to get the wrong idea,\nso I’ll explain. This isn’t something you can breathe to anyone, not even in\nthe family, do you understand?” Anden was still too distressed to reply, but\nLan smacked a hand hard to the wall next to his face. “Do you?” Anden\nnodded.\nLan said quietly, “Shine is a plague on society. It’s used by people with\nno natural jade tolerance or training whatsoever—foreigners, criminals, jade-\nfevered addicts. That’s why the illegal shine trade has to be stamped out. But\nSN1 isn’t all bad. As a drug that blunts the detrimental side effects of jade\nexposure, it can be useful. There are times when a Green Bone’s natural\ntolerance needs a boost.” He paused. “You can understand that, can’t you?”\nAnden’s mind flashed back to the conversation he’d had with Hilo on the"

        "text": "tolerance needs a boost.” He paused. “You can understand that, can’t you?”\nAnden’s mind flashed back to the conversation he’d had with Hilo on the\ngrounds of the Academy, then unwittingly to the memory of his mother in the\nbathtub. Yes, he understood what Lan was saying. But the Kauls were\ndifferent—the epitome of impeccable Green Bone blood and schooling. If\nKaul Lan, the Pillar of the No Peak clan, needed SN1, what did that mean?\nEspecially for someone like Anden—what hope did he have? His thoughts\nchurned in denial. “It’s all that new jade you’re wearing, isn’t it?” Anden’s\nvoice was an agitated whisper. “Is there something wrong with it? Is it\ndangerous because it used to belong to Gam?”\nLan managed a humorless smile. “No. Jade is an amplifier; it doesn’t\nretain energy from its previous owners, no matter what old superstitions\nyou’ve heard.” He turned his face away slightly and his voice fell. “I didn’t\nget out of the duel unscathed, Anden.” He tapped his chest above his heart.\n“Gam disrupted something when he Channeled into me. I haven’t been\nfeeling quite right since then. It’s made carrying new jade harder than it\nshould be.”\nWorry crowded in. “Have you seen a doctor? The one at the Academy is\n—”\n“I’ve seen Dr. Truw. The healing sessions help, but there’s nothing else to\nbe done for it besides time and rest.” He grimaced, acknowledging that he\nwas in short supply of both those things. Anden understood now why his\ncousin was so edgy, volatile. He’d been carrying a secret injury along with\nnew green and the pressures of being a wartime Pillar. And now the shame of\nneeding SN1 to be able to bear the jade he’d won in a public duel.\n“Don’t wear it, then,” Anden insisted. “Not until you’re better. It’s too\nmuch.”\nLan shook his head. “I can’t disappear from sight right now. Every day, I\nmeet with people—councilmen, Lantern Men, Luckbringers, Fists and\nFingers—all of them looking for assurances and evidence that No Peak can\nstand up to the Mountain. Meanwhile, our enemies are searching for any sign\nof weakness on our part, waiting for another chance to strike. I can’t give that\nto them.” His expression was weary as he backed off from Anden. “This isn’t\nyour concern. When you leave this room, I want you to forget about it.”\n“But the shine, isn’t it bad for you? It’s addictive, right? And—”\n“It’s temporary,” Lan snapped, eyes lighting up again in a way that made\nAnden shrink back and shut his mouth. “I’m not going to get addicted. And I\ncan’t have anyone else in the clan even thinking that might happen. I had\nWoon arrange for a private supply of SN1 because it would be suspicious for\nme to be visiting Dr. Truw too often. It’s even too much of a risk to have my\nPillarman seen picking up unusual packages. People are watching closely.\nI’m trusting you, Anden, despite what you just did. Your uncle was one of"

Your uncle was one of\nmy best friends, and I’ve always thought of you as my littlest brother. You’re\nmore like me than Hilo ever was. I’ve never asked you for anything, but I’m\nasking you now, to keep this secret.”\nAnden swallowed, then nodded. As soon as he did so, he thought, I should\nbreak this promise. I should tell Hilo. He wasn’t even sure how to reach Hilo\nthese days; the Horn was out patrolling No Peak territory with his Fists at all\nhours. And what would Hilo say?\nHilo would say Lan was the Pillar and that it wasn’t Anden’s place to\nsecond-guess him. That there were special cases when using shine was\nacceptable; Hilo had suggested Anden himself might be one of those cases.\nNo Peak depended on the Pillar staying strong and in control of the clan.\nTaking minor doses of SN1 to help him adjust to the new jade load was far\nbetter than risking madness and the Itches. That was true for certain.\nLan’s watching eyes were narrowed. “Can I still count on you, Anden?”\nThe censure in the Pillar’s voice was like a slap. Before today, Anden had\nnever given Lan reason to distrust him, and seeing the disappointment in his\ncousin’s face now was enough to make Anden gulp with remorse. “I know\nwhat I did was wrong. I’m sorry, Lan-jen. I won’t break your trust again; I\nswear it on all the jade I’ll ever wear, but please …” Anden’s fists clenched at\nhis sides and he blurted, “There has to be a better solution than taking that\nstuff!”\nThe margins of the Pillar’s grim stare softened. He seemed like himself\nagain—steady, collected—but his expression was uncertain, almost forlorn,\nas if he’d expected something else, something Anden thought it was his fault\nhe couldn’t give. “It’s my place to deal with this Anden, not yours.” He\nlooked at Anden sadly for another long moment, then went to the door and\nslid it open again. “You ought to get back to the Academy before it gets late.”\nFor a second, Anden didn’t move. Then he touched his hands to his\nforehead in a salute that hid his face. “I know. You’re right, Kaul-jen.” He\nwalked quickly out of the training room. Once he was across the courtyard,\nhe wanted to turn around to see if his cousin was still standing where he’d left\nhim. Instead he set his gaze in front of his feet and hurried through the house.\n“Anden-se?” Kyanla queried from the entrance of the kitchen as he\nrounded the staircase in the foyer and rushed for the door. “Everything all\nright?”\n“Fine. I’ve got to go. I’ll see you later, Kyanla.” Anden burst from the\nfront doors and down the steps of the walk. He slowed down enough to avoid\nany curious looks as he passed the Fingers posted at the gates, but once he\nwas off the Kaul property and out of sight, he broke into a run.

When the bus came a few minutes later, Anden got on in a daze. He\nfell into a seat at the back and leaned his head against the window. The\ntightness in his chest hadn’t gone away even after he’d stopped running. He\nwished he could make himself cry to release some of the pressure, like lifting\nthe top off a boiling kettle.\nCHAPTER\n29\nYou’ll Probably Die\nS\ntealing from the Docks had become an even more dangerous proposition\never since Maik Kehn had picked up that one crew and No Peak had gotten\nwise to the scheme. Bero did not want to end up like those other poor\nbastards—the two with broken necks, or even the one who got off easy with\njust the broken arms. He still shuddered when he thought of the Maik\nbrothers. So he was relieved and excited when Mudt asked him if he’d been\npracticing with the Fullerton and could shoot straight yet. He assured Mudt\nthat he and Cheeky had been going out to the empty fields by the reservoir\nand firing off rounds three times a week.\n“Come over to the store tomorrow night then,” said Mudt.\nThe Green Bone with the goatee was shooting pool on Mudt’s old pool\ntable in the garage of the Goody Too when they arrived. Instead of a rain\nslicker, he was wearing a gray trench coat and the same combat boots as\nbefore. He was friendlier this time. “It’s been more than a month and you\nboys are still alive and doing good work for us, so that means you’re either\nsmart or godsdamned lucky, I don’t care which.”\n“I can do more than lift boxes of fancy purses and shit,” said Bero.\n“That’s what I figured. Now you’ll have a chance to prove it,” said the\ngoateed man. He put a hand on each boy’s shoulder. “Mudt tells me you can\nhandle the Fully guns I gave you. That’s good. So now I’ve got a job for you.\nThis job’s not coming from me, it’s coming from above the people who are\nabove me, so listen carefully and don’t fuck it up. If you do, you’ll probably\ndie, but if you don’t, you’ll be cut with the clan, as cut as can be, which\nmeans—” He looked significantly at Bero and winked, giving the jade bolt in\nhis left ear a little tug.\n“What do you want us to do?” asked Bero.\n“The Lilac Divine Gentleman’s Club, you know it?” The Green Bone\nsmirked. Every teenage boy who lived on this side of town knew of the Lilac\nDivine, but it was a high-class establishment; Mrs. Sugo’s muscled bouncers\nglared with contempt and cracked their knuckles threateningly if anyone the\nlikes of Bero and Cheeky loitered nearby in futile curiosity.

A driver\nwill pick you up and take you to the Lilac Divine; Mudt will arrange that.\nWhen you get there, I want you to put those Fullys to good use. Shoot up the\nplace, break the windows, send every customer in there diving under the bed\nwith his limp dick in his hands. You see some nice cars, especially a real nice\nsilver Roewolfe, you fill it with lead. Spray and pray, kekes, got it?”\n“Th-the Lilac Divine’s a No Peak place.” Cheeky stammered a little.\n“There’ll be big-shot Lantern Men and Green Bones inside. They say even\nthe Pillar of the clan goes there.”\n“Oh, you figured it out just now, did you, genius?” The Green Bone\nsmirked even more broadly. “You’ll have to be quicker than that if you’re\ngoing to get out of No Peak territory alive afterward. That part’s not my\nproblem. But you do this and come back and no one’s going to question that\nyou’re cut, that you’ve got what it takes.”\n“We’ll do it, if you promise this’ll get us in.” The words left Bero’s mouth\nbefore Cheeky could do more than twitch. Mudt and his son were sorting\nboxes of stolen vinyl records, pretending not to be part of the discussion, but\nthey paused and looked up at Bero’s sudden vehemence. He didn’t care what\nthe Green Bone sent him to do, but he was getting impatient and didn’t want\nto be jerked around. “There’s not going to be some other test after this,\nright?”\n“I don’t promise you a godsdamned thing,” the Green Bone snapped.\n“You do a good job, you make a big impression, show just how valuable you\ncan be to the clan—that’s when we talk for real.”\nCheeky swallowed and nodded quickly. Bero shoved his hands into his\npockets and kept his crooked face stiff.\nYears ago, in the part of the Forge where Bero grew up, there had been an\nolder boy called Fishhook, who used to terrorize the smaller boys, who would\nchase and beat Bero every chance he got. One day, Fishhook got his hands on\na pretty girl whose father was a union boss and No Peak Lantern Man, and\nshortly afterward, a couple of Green Bone Fingers arrived in their corner of\nthe neighborhood and calmly broke Fishhook’s shins. Fishhook was never\nable to catch Bero after that.\nAll Green Bones reminded Bero of those Fingers. They walked into his\nworld carelessly to break a person’s bones or deliver them to a better life.\nThey stirred in Bero not merely a boyhood awe and fear, but a deeply\nconsuming resentment and envy.\nThe goateed Green Bone was no different. He smiled as if amused, but his\neyes remained cold and knowing. “Wait for the call,” he said over his\nshoulder as he left the garage. “It’ll come soon.”\nCHAPTER\n30\nThe Temple of Divine Return\nT\nhe odor of cut grass and sweet roasted figs permeated the thuds and grunts\nof the relayball game and the occasional gasped exclamation or murmur of"

        "text": "CHAPTER\n30\nThe Temple of Divine Return\nT\nhe odor of cut grass and sweet roasted figs permeated the thuds and grunts\nof the relayball game and the occasional gasped exclamation or murmur of\nappreciation from the crowd. Shae picked her way into a section of the low\nbleachers populated by Kaul Du Academy fans and settled into an empty\nseat. Glancing over at the scoreboard, she saw that the game was close. The\nAcademy was a martial school where physical prowess was revered, but the\nwearing of jade was not permitted in professional sports. The opposing team\nwas from a large city school that regularly turned out national league players;\nthey were surely eager to show up future Green Bones.\nShae searched for her cousin and barely recognized him at first. He was\nno longer the awkward kid she remembered. Anden had filled out with an\nadult Green Bone’s physique. He was wearing dark shorts and playing first\nguard, sticking tight to his opponent as the ball sailed into their zone. The\nother player leapt to kick it to a teammate, but Anden, both taller and faster,\nsmacked it out of the air. The two teens collided and went down in a tangle as\nthe ball bounced into the net. The whistle blew for the ball to be rethrown.\nA relayball field consists of seven zones separated by waist-high nets—\nfive rectangular pass zones and two triangular end zones. Each zone is\noccupied by two players, one from each side, who are not permitted to leave\ntheir enclosed space as they attempt to throw, hit, kick, or bounce the ball off\ntheir body to their teammates down the field, zone to zone, over the nets to\nthe opposing team’s end zone, where it is the job of the finisher to put the ball\nbetween the guardian’s point posts. As the game is essentially a series of\nviolent one-on-one skirmishes, ample opportunity exists for personal as well\nas team enmity. As Anden got to his feet, the opponent in his zone glared at\nhim and spat some insult at his back. Anden did not deign to turn around and\nreact. He bent his knees, ready, squinting into the horizontal orange light of\nthe setting sun.\nThe ball flew straight up from the referee’s hands. Anden jumped to\nshoulder check the other player, reaching with one arm to seize the ball and\nhurl it over the net to his teammate in the instant before he was tackled to the\nground. Shae stomped her feet appreciatively along with the crowd. She was\nimpressed by her cousin’s grace and aggression on the field, his workmanlike\nathleticism. He seemed to approach relayball as a duty, not a game—he took\nlittle outward satisfaction in a good play and grimaced only faintly after bad\nones. Already, she could picture him as a Green Bone, one of No Peak’s\nFists.\nShe was not alone in this. In the row behind her, someone said, “The\nAcademy first guard there—that’s the Mad Witch’s boy, the one the Kauls\ntook in. You can bet the Horn is counting down the days until that one gets\nhis jade.”\n“Him and the whole crop of year-eights,” someone else added.\nA point was scored by the Academy finisher, and the spectators stomped\ntheir feet on the bleachers in approval.

The applause was brief and faded\nquickly back to silence. Sporting events on Kekon were different from how\nthey were in Espenia. Shae had been astounded by how rowdy and jovial the\ncrowds were over there. The Espenians sang and chanted constantly; they\ncheered and booed, waved flags, and shouted nonsensical instructions at the\nplayers and coaches. The Kekonese were no less passionate in their team\nloyalties, but no one would think to yell at the field or distract the\nparticipants. The Espenians, Shae had concluded, believed the athletes were\nthere to entertain the audience; the energy of the crowd was part of the game.\nThe Kekonese considered themselves separate from the conflict, mere\nwitnesses to a feud waged on their behalf.\nKaul Du Academy won the game narrowly by a single point. Afterward,\nthe players saluted their opponents, then milled by the bench, gathering their\nequipment. Shae went down and stood at the edge of the small field until\nAnden noticed her. He squinted in her direction. Breaking into a broad smile\nof recognition, he slung his bag over his shoulder and loped toward her.\n“Shae-jen,” he said, then flushed, embarrassed at the understandable but\nawkward mistake. He gave her a brief hug, warm but respectful, then took his\nglasses out of their case and pushed them onto the sweaty bridge of his nose.\n“Sorry. It’ll take me a while to get used to just calling you Shae.”\n“You were fantastic out there tonight,” she told him. “They would’ve tied\nit up if it hadn’t been for that intercept of yours in the last quarter.”\n“The sun was in the other fellow’s eyes,” he said, polite as always.\n“Do you want to get something to eat? We can do it another time if you’d\nrather go out with your friends tonight.” The other Academy players were\ndeparting. She’d noticed that, even as a member of the team, Anden seemed\nslightly apart from his classmates. It had been that way for her as well at the\nAcademy, and she didn’t want to deprive him of the chance to be part of the\ngroup tonight.\n“No, I’d rather talk to you,” said Anden quickly, glancing back at his\nteammates for only a second. “If you have the time, that is. Do you?”\nShe assured him that she did, and they walked together from the field. The\nevenings were cool now, by Janloon standards, and Shae drew a sweater\naround herself as they wandered Old Town to a somewhat sleepy night\nmarket where hawkers sold colorful kites and wooden spinning tops\nalongside fake gold watches and music tapes, and the smell of spicy fried\nnuts and sugared beets rose up from the food stalls. They talked about the\ngame, and when they’d exhausted that topic, Shae asked her cousin about\nschool, and he asked her about studying abroad and how she liked her new\napartment in North Sotto.

        "text": "apartment in North Sotto. Anden was not reticent, but he was not a\nparticularly talkative sort, no more than Shae, so their conversation remained\njust shy of awkward, both of them trying to think of questions to draw out the\nother person, both hesitating to fill in the lapses.\nA white paper lantern hung over the door of the barbecue restaurant on the\nstreet corner, but they waited in line with everyone else. Once seated at a\nsmall, yellow, vinyl-covered table on a lamplit patio covered by a sagging\ntarp, they ate sweet glazed pork and vinegary cabbage from greasy paper\nbaskets. Anden dug in eagerly but couldn’t finish the hefty portions of\nroasted meat; too much rich restaurant fare didn’t sit well with a stomach\naccustomed to the modest portions and simple food of the Academy.\n“Anden, I’m sorry it took me so long to come see you,” Shae said at last.\n“I don’t have a good excuse; I intended to do it sooner but couldn’t get over\nhow awkward it would be to visit the Academy. I’ve been busy job hunting,\nand before that I was traveling and doing something for Lan. It took me\nlonger than I expected to get settled into a routine.” She stopped offering\nfurther rationalizations. The things Hilo had said to her, accusing her of\nneglecting to show kindness to her family since her return to Janloon—they\nwere true, and some had cut deep.\nAnden stared at his hands, fastidiously wiping the sauce from under his\nnails with one of the moist square towelettes torn from a tiny paper packet.\nHis brow was drawn down and creased. “Have you seen Lan lately?”\nHe appeared not to have heard anything she’d just said. “A few weeks\nago. He’s busy, I’m sure.” She’d made no recent effort to go to the house.\n“When are you going to see him next?”\nShae was surprised. She’d always known her cousin to be courteous, but\nthe tone of Anden’s voice now was almost demanding. “I’m going to the\nhouse for dinner in a few days. I’ll likely see him then,” she said. “Why?”\nAnden was tearing the remains of his paper towelette into shreds and not\nlooking directly at her. “I thought maybe you could talk to him. See how he’s\ndoing, whether he needs help with anything. Ever since the duel at the\nFactory, he seems … different. Stressed. You might … I don’t know. Get him\nto relax a little, maybe.”\nShae raised her eyebrows. She remembered that Anden had always\nidolized Lan, had always enjoyed a special attention from him. “Lan is the\nPillar; it’s not his job to relax,” she said. “If he seems troubled or distant to\nyou, it’s because there are a lot of problems that he has to deal with right\nnow.” Anden was listening but still shredding the towelette, so she said in\nwhat she hoped was a more reassuring voice, “Don’t worry too much.”\nAnden crumpled the torn towelette and dropped it onto the remaining\nscraps of his dinner. He spoke hesitantly, “Shae, I think … I think Lan might\nnot be making the right decisions about some things. I know I’m not a Green"

I know I’m not a Green\nBone yet and it’s not my place to say that. But I’ll be getting my jade soon,\nand I want to help.” His words sped into a low torrent. “I was thinking I\nought to talk to Hilo, but he’s got a lot to worry about too, and he’ll just tell\nme to sit back and focus on school and not second-guess the Pillar. I thought\nmaybe you could—”\nShae broke in. “As much as I hate to admit it, Hilo’s right.” It was a little\npainful to see Anden already so emotionally invested in the clan and its\ntroubles. “When I was a year-eight, I was like you—I couldn’t wait to\ngraduate and get my jade and be a proper member of the clan. I shouldn’t\nhave been in such a rush. You’re only a student for four more months—so\njust be a student. Don’t get sucked into clan business so early on when you\ndon’t have to be.” She tried to catch her cousin’s eye. “In fact, you don’t ever\nhave to be, if you don’t want to. Being a Green Bone is only one way of life.\nYou don’t have to choose it.”\n“What else would I choose?” the teen asked, with a surprising amount of\nsullenness and heat. “I’m not naive. Why would Grandda have brought me\ninto the family, why would he have sent me to the Academy, if it wasn’t so I\nwould be part of the clan someday? And that someday is now.”\n“Grandda doesn’t always know best.” Once, she would never have\nadmitted this out loud to anyone. “Lan’s the one who brought you in, and he\ndid it because it was the right thing to do, not because he thought you’d\nbecome a useful Fist.” She sighed. “I can tell you’re worried about the war,\nbut—”\n“Aren’t you worried?” Anden exclaimed. He flushed at his outburst but\nseemed beyond caring if he was being rude.\nShae reminded herself that the Mountain had snatched Anden off the\nstreet on Boat Day. No wonder he was still furious and scared. She had to\nadmit that the near breach of aisho disturbed her as well; since sending Caun\naway, she’d become more careful about staying within No Peak territory. She\nforced the defensiveness out of her voice. “Of course I’m worried. But I’m\nnot involved. I’m not a Green Bone anymore. I made the choice not to be.”\n“Why?” A quiet question. It was the first time he’d ever asked her.\nShe realized she didn’t know Anden very well. When she spoke to her\ngrandfather or her brothers, she fell into old cadences that sometimes made\nher feel as if she’d never left the island. She didn’t have that familiarity with\nAnden. They’d gotten along well enough when they were young, but she’d\nmissed out entirely on the last few years of his life, when he’d grown from a\nsolemn, somewhat haunted-looking boy to this young man, the protégé of her\nbrothers.\n“The clan is all or nothing, Anden.

And I learned pretty quick that wasn’t allowed.” A\nhumorless smile crept over her lips. “It was a bit more complicated, but you\nget the gist.”\nAnden did not look satisfied, but he didn’t press. His eyes followed the\nnight flies buzzing around one of the dim lamps, then returned to her. “So\nwhat do you plan to do now?”\n“I have a job offer I’m thinking of taking.” Shae straightened in her seat,\nglad to share her recent news with someone, though she doubted anyone in\nthe family would appreciate what it meant to her. “It’s a regional business\ndevelopment position at an Espenian electronics company. I’ll be going back\nto Espenia for company training for a few months, and afterward working\npart of the time there and part of the time here, and traveling to other places\nin the world, too. I think it’ll be interesting.”\nDismay rose on Anden’s face. Only with a visible effort did he force it\nback into a barely neutral expression. “You’re leaving again?”\nShae was nonplussed. “Only temporarily. Like I said, the training is only\nfor a few months. After that, I’ll be in Kekon at least half of the time. I\nwouldn’t want to live in Espenia year-round, so I think this job will …” She\ntrailed off, guilt and resentment stopping her throat. Anden had just asked her\nif she would prevail upon Lan on his behalf. He’d hoped that even if she held\nno official role in the clan and was no longer a Green Bone, that she would\nstill be present and influential, a member of the family war effort that perhaps\nhe could count on.\nHadn’t she just told him that the clan was all or nothing?\n“I’m sorry, that was rude of me.” Anden seemed to suddenly rouse\nhimself, to realize that his response had been selfish and inappropriate.\nQuickly, “It’s only that I was glad you’d come back and thought I’d get to\nsee you more before you jetted off again. I’m happy for you, though. The job\nsounds like a really good one, an international businesswoman’s kind of job.\nCongratulations, Shae. I mean it.” And even though his disappointment was\nstill palpable, he smiled with such an earnest desire to put things right\nbetween them that Shae could not help but soften and wish that she could\nrecover as gracefully.\n“It’s fine, Anden,” she assured him. “And I do think we’ll get to spend\nsome more time together. It’s my fault we didn’t do this earlier; I didn’t hear\nabout what happened to you on Boat Day, not until just recently. If I’d known\nabout that, I would’ve—”\nAnden shook his head sharply, almost angrily. “That was nothing,” he\nsaid. “They didn’t threaten or hurt me. I’m not a Green Bone yet.”\nShae was silent for a minute. Behind them, the counter staff shouted out\norders to the cramped kitchen, people chatted and laughed as they stood in\nline, moths fluttered, trapped, under the green canvas tarp over the patio."

Don’t worry about it.” With deliberate\njoviality, he pushed back his chair and said, “This place was really good; the\nbest meal I’ve had in months. You remember Academy food, don’t you?”\n“Unfortunately, yes.” Whatever was gnawing at him, whatever he’d\nwanted to say, Shae could no longer press him for it. She let him lead their\nconversation back to lighter topics as they stood up and gathered their things.\nThey walked to the nearest subway station with meager talk; Anden had gone\na little quiet. When they got to the platform and the westbound train arrived,\nhe gave her a brief embrace. “It was good to see you, Shae. Another time\nsoon?” And then the doors were closing behind him and the long screeching\ncars were carrying him away. Shae watched the lights disappear down the\nyawning tunnel with the unshakable suspicion that she’d let her cousin down,\nmissed some vital opportunity between them.\nInstead of going home, she took the eastbound line and got off at the station\nthat let out almost directly in front of the Janloon Temple of Divine Return.\nThe street she ascended onto had recently been widened; she certainly\ncouldn’t recall ever seeing so many lanes of traffic in front of the entrance. A\nsix-story office building now butted up against the nearby public square; the\nside of its new parking structure displayed a billboard for Ygutanian ale. The\nTemple itself, however, looked exactly the same as Shae remembered, even\nmore ancient and solemn at night than during the day, the carved stone pillars\nand massive clay roof flickering with deep shadows in the headlights of\npassing cars. Shae hadn’t been inside the Temple since she was a teenager,\nbut tonight, feeling unsettled, she felt compelled to walk through its peaked\ngreen doors.\nThe Temple District contained not only the Temple of Divine Return, the\noldest Deitist temple in the city, but also, two blocks away, the folk Shrine of\nNimuma, and not much farther west, the Janloon First Church of One Truth.\nIt was heartening to think of Kekonese, Abukei, and foreigners all\nworshipping within sight of one another, praying on common footing. The\ncharter of the KJA allocated jade to the Deitist temples before any other\ngroup, and the clans gave charitably to the upkeep of religious buildings, but\npenitent oaths eschewed all worldly allegiances and gave sanctuary to all\nworshippers. Like the area around Wisdom Hall and the Triumphal Palace,\nthe Temple District was neutral ground.

        "text": "worshippers. Like the area around Wisdom Hall and the Triumphal Palace,\nthe Temple District was neutral ground. Here the clans did not rule.\nShae passed through the quiet courtyard with its rows of devotional trees\nlimned with the soft glow of moonlight, and into the dimly lit inner sanctum\nwhere the resident penitents sat in continuous three-hour shifts of meditative\nprayer. When she saw the circle of green-robed, motionless figures on the\nlow platform at the front of the room, Shae’s step slowed. She wondered how\ndeeply the penitents could Perceive her. Was it possible, with enough jade\npower, to go beyond sensing a person’s presence and the subtleties of their\nphysical state, to see into their thoughts, into their very souls?\nShae chose one of the kneeling cushions and lowered herself onto it. She\ntouched her head to the ground three times as was custom, then straightened\nup, her hands on her thighs, her eyes drawn again to the three men and three\nwomen penitents, their heads and eyebrows shaved, their eyes closed. Each\nsat cross-legged with hands resting on the top of a mounted jade orb the size\nof a small bowling ball. To be in contact with so much jade … Shae was\nreminded of the boulders she’d seen at the mine pit, the mad temptation to\nput her hand on one of them. The penitents must possess exceptional training\nand control. They could probably hear a fly landing on a cushion in the back\nof the room, or Perceive the people on the street outside, yet they were\nmotionless, breathing slowly and steadily, their faces relaxed. At the end of\nthe three hours, they would lift their hands from their stations, then stand up\nand glide away as others took their place. Each time, they were battered by\njade rush and withdrawal. Shae knew what withdrawal was like and it made\nher cringe to imagine going through it in shifts, day and night, over and over\nagain. The penitents believed it would bring them, and humanity, closer to\ngodliness.\nShae let her eyes roam. Above the meditating circle hung the famous\nmural of Banishment and Return. The original artwork, painted hundreds of\nyears ago, had been destroyed during the Shotarian occupation; what\nworshippers saw now was a skillful reconstruction based on memory and old\nphotographs. Along the stone walls of the sanctum, fragrant incense candles\nburned in alcoves devoted to each of the major deities. The gentle trickle of\nwater from the two wall fountains wound into the ambient road noise that\nintruded through the high open windows. At this late hour, the sanctum was\nnearly empty; there were only three other visitors kneeling on the green\ncongregational cushions—an elderly man in the back corner, and three rows\nin front of Shae, a middle-aged woman with her grown daughter, both of\nthem weeping and leaning on each other for support. Shae dropped her gaze\nto the floor in front of her own cushion, embarrassed to be witnessing their\nprivate family anguish. She felt awkward and hypocritical to have come to\nthis holy place at all. She had not practiced the faith in years. She wasn’t even\nsure she could call herself a Deitist anymore.\nThe Kauls were nominally religious, of course. There was a sparsely used"

        "text": "sure she could call herself a Deitist anymore.\nThe Kauls were nominally religious, of course. There was a sparsely used\nprayer room in the house, and on the major holidays during Shae’s childhood,\nthe family had dressed in their best clothes and gone to the Temple. Members\nof their vast and powerful clan would mill about outside until the family car\npulled up in front. Then there would be a flurry of saluting and respect-\npaying. At such times, Kaul Sen was at his best, greeting everyone with the\nsame consideration and magnanimity whether they were the most prosperous\nLantern Man or the most junior Finger. After an appropriate time, Shae’s\ngrandfather would lead Shae’s mother, her brothers, her, (and later, Anden)\ninside, and the crowd of people would follow them in, and the whole sanctum\nwould hum with their hushed voices and the throb of jade energy.\nKaul Sen was always front and center in the first row. His wife knelt on\nhis left. To his right was Lan, then Hilo, then Shae, (then Anden, once he was\na Kaul), then their mother. The service would drone on for hours. Learned\nOnes, the most senior lifelong penitents, would lead the assembled\nworshippers in the recitations of exaltation for the deities, and then guide the\nmeditation prayers concerning the attainment of the Divine Virtues. During\nthe chanting, Hilo would fidget and make faces, and Kaul Sen would glower\nat him. Shae’s legs would go numb. She concentrated on ignoring Hilo.\nWhen she was older, she grew to find the services tolerable. Eventually,\nshe realized the recitations were hopeful and calming. Deitism was a deeply\nKekonese faith. There were different sects, from the nationalistic to the\npacifistic, but one thing they all agreed upon was that jade was a link to\nHeaven, a divine but dangerous gift meant to be used piously and for good.\nGreen Bones had to strive to be worthy people. Virtuous people. People, Shae\nbelieved, like her grandfather.\nAs a child, however, she didn’t ponder spirituality; she thought about how\nmuch longer the ordeal would go on. When she slumped or leaned or\ngroaned, her mother prodded her upright. “Sit straight and be quiet,” she\nadmonished. “Everyone is watching you.”\nThat had been her mother’s entire philosophy of life: Sit straight and be\nquiet. Everyone is watching you. Well, no one was watching Shae now.\nWithout a jade aura, she might pass any of her old Academy classmates in the\nstreet and not even be recognized. When she’d gotten the phone call from the\nregional director of Standard & Croft Appliance, it had pleased her to know\nthe job offer had been made in ignorance about her family. Yet she’d felt\nonly a vaguely satisfied relief. Not happiness, not enthusiasm. She had a\ngraduate degree, her own apartment, and a job offer from an international\ncompany, one that any of her business school classmates in Espenia would’ve\ncongratulated her on.

She was supposed to feel free and unencumbered,\nnot lonely and uncertain.\nShae bent her head. She wasn’t sure if she believed in the ancestor gods,\nor in the Banishment and Return, or even in the idea that jade came from\nHeaven. But every Green Bone knew that invisible energy could be felt,\ntapped, and harnessed. The world worked at a deeper level, and maybe if she\nconcentrated hard enough, even without jade, she could communicate with it.\nGuide me, she prayed. Give me a sign.\nCHAPTER\n31\nNot According to Plan\nL\nan was in his study when the phone call came in from Hilo. It was on a\nline that was separate from the others. Only Hilo was aware of the number,\nand he knew to use it only for urgent matters that required an absolutely\nsecure connection.\n“I found the proof you wanted,” the Horn said, without preamble. “Doru’s\nbeen in regular contact with the Mountain. He’s been taking payment from\nthem through secret accounts.”\nLan felt a heaviness descend. “You’re sure?”\n“I’m sure.”\nReluctance kept the Pillar silent for a second. “We’ll handle this tonight,\nthen.” He looked at the clock. The workday was almost over; Doru would\nsoon be leaving his office on Ship Street. There was no point in delaying—\nthat would only spook the traitor and make the whole affair more painful for\neveryone.\nHe made the necessary arrangements with Hilo, then hung up and sat\nquietly and gloomily for a few minutes. The Weather Man had recently\nreturned from Ygutan with information on the Mountain’s activities in that\ncountry, including details on its shine-producing facilities and business\ndealings. The Fist and the Finger that had been sent as Doru’s bodyguards\nhad watched him closely and reported no suspicious behavior on the part of\nthe Weather Man during the trip.\nDoru was not stupid; he knew he was on weak footing in the clan, and\nwith Kaul Sen’s lucidity growing more unreliable by the day, it appeared\nhe’d decided to hunker down and behave. He’d even gamely swallowed the\ninsult of Lan suspending the KJA in his absence without consulting him.\nEven though Lan had mentally prepared himself for Hilo’s call, the pleasant\nchange in Doru’s behavior had made him think, for a short while, that\nperhaps he’d been wrong about the man’s compromised loyalties.\nHe called Woon into his office. When the Pillarman arrived, Lan stood up\nto greet him. “You’ve been a friend to me for many years, and a good\nPillarman for the last three,” Lan said. “Starting tomorrow morning, you’ll be\nWeather Man of No Peak.”\nWoon could not have been entirely shocked by the appointment, but he\nwas still overcome with gratitude. “The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its\nmaster,” he said, saluting deeply. “Thank you for this honor, Lan-jen. I won’t\nfail you.”\nLan embraced him and said, “I’ve given you more responsibility for the"

I won’t\nfail you.”\nLan embraced him and said, “I’ve given you more responsibility for the\npast several months, and you’ve done well. You’re ready.” In truth, he was\nnot entirely confident in his statement; he still felt Woon was not quite up to\nthe caliber of a superior Weather Man, but he was capable enough and Lan\nheld no doubt of the man’s loyalty. In any case, there was no choice now;\nWoon had to step up to the task. “Not a word of this news to anyone, until\nafter I give you permission tomorrow.”\n“I understand, Lan-jen,” Woon said, with a proper somberness that\nshowed he was perfectly aware he was coming into the role on account of\nanother’s misfortune.\n“These are difficult times for the clan; you’ll have to be prepared to take\ncontrol of the Weather Man’s office quickly. Go home early tonight and get a\ngood night’s rest, but let’s have a drink together first.” Lan took a bottle from\nhis cabinet and poured them each a glass of hoji, which they enjoyed in\nmuted celebration.\nAfter Woon had reiterated his thanks and departed, Lan went through\npapers at his desk without truly paying attention to them. These days, he\nnever felt as if he was at his best, either physically or mentally. The lingering\nweakness in his body heightened his constant anxiety over the threats to the\nclan, and now knowing that the next twenty-four hours would be particularly\ndifficult made it hard to concentrate.\nAn envelope sitting in an untouched stack of mail caught Lan’s attention.\nWhen he extracted it, he saw that the return address was a postbox in\nStepenland. A letter from Eyni. Lan fingered the edges of the seal, eager and\ndeeply reluctant to break it open. Since the divorce, they’d exchanged only a\nfew letters—cordial and businesslike, settling affairs, her telling him where to\nmail belongings, that sort of thing. But seeing her handwriting, hearing her\nvoice in his head—it never failed to bring down his mood. With what he\nalready had to deal with today, he sighed aloud.\nShe’d confessed the affair to him. One of Hilo’s men had seen her\nentering an apartment building with her lover, and knowing her secret was\nlost, Eyni had gone straight back to the house before the news could make its\nway through the Horn back to Lan. “Please don’t kill him,” she’d begged in a\nwhisper, sitting on the edge of their bed with her hands squeezed between her\nknees. “He’s not Kekonese; he doesn’t understand our ways. I’ll stop seeing\nhim and stay with you here, or I’ll leave and you’ll never have to see me\nagain—whatever you tell me to do. But please don’t kill him. And don’t let\nHilo kill him. That’s all I ask.” And it was this heartfelt plea, driven by her\nobviously genuine fear, that saddened Lan the most, because even after five\nyears of marriage she obviously didn’t really know him at all.\n“Is he really such a better person than I am?” Lan asked dully.\nEyni looked up, eyebrows raised in surprise.

Even distraught, her heart-\nshaped face had a genuine and unpretentious prettiness. “Of course not. But\nhe’s not the Pillar of the great No Peak clan. He doesn’t cancel dinner plans,\nhe doesn’t travel with bodyguards, no one recognizes him or salutes him in\npublic or stops him to ask for favors for their relatives. He can act silly, and\nsleep late, and go away on vacation at a moment’s notice, and do all the\nthings we once did together.”\n“You always knew I would be Pillar someday,” Lan reminded her\naccusingly. “You understood it would be this way. There are plenty of\nwomen who’d be thankful, grateful, to be the wife of the Pillar. You\npromised me that you were one of them.”\nEyni’s eyes filled with tears of remorse. “I was once.”\nI should make her stay, Lan had thought with classic Kekonese\nvindictiveness. In exchange for this foreigner’s life, she has to stay and give\nme an heir, for the clan.\nIn the end, he couldn’t bring himself to be so cruel to either her or\nhimself.\nThe envelope in Lan’s hand now was square and stiff, like a greeting card.\nIt looked thicker, like it contained a longer and more substantial message than\nprevious mailings. He imagined opening it to find a letter in which Eyni\nrepented and begged him to take her back. Far more likely, with well-\nmeaning heartlessness, she’d written to reassure him that she was fine, to\nwish him well, and to tell him about her new home overseas and all the things\nshe was seeing and doing with her boyfriend.\nLan shut the letter in his desk drawer. In either case, this was not the right\ntime to be distracted by melancholy thoughts of his ex-wife. He would open\nit later. And because it still taunted from inside the closed drawer, Lan got up\nand left the house. It was a Fifthday evening and there would still be plenty\nof time to get back and await Hilo’s phone call.\nHours later, Lan did not, even after a meal and a lay at the Lilac Divine, feel\nconsiderably better. He sat on the end of the bed, finishing a cigarette and\nwringing a final few minutes of peace from the evening before he had to\nleave.\n“Is something wrong?” Yunni crawled up behind him and looped her bare\narms around his neck, but he disentangled himself and stood up. He pulled on\nhis pants, then walked into the bathroom with its scented candles and red\nlighting. He splashed his face with cold water, then took a hand towel from\nthe rack and wiped down his neck and bare chest. From the bed, Yunni\ncoaxed, “Must you leave so soon? Come back to bed. Stay the night.”\nShe’d like that. She’d make more money if he stayed; it would make up\nfor the fact he’d been coming here less. “I’d like to be alone for a while\nnow,” he said, and because he couldn’t bring himself to be unkind to her,\n“please.”\nThe charm girl’s artfully polished facade faltered for a second.

She\ncrossed her arms over her breasts. He could sense her indignation at the\ndismissal: Who did he think she was? A street whore? Where was the\nsophisticated client she used to have, the one who enjoyed singing and harp\nmusic, conversation and wine?\nShe recomposed herself admirably and stood up with unhurried grace. “As\nyou like, Kaul-jen.” Yunni gathered her robe around herself, slid her feet into\nslippers, and padded out the door, shutting it behind her firmly to announce\nher irritation. Lan didn’t watch her go. He put on his watch and looked at the\ntime. Right now, three Fists were waiting to seize Yun Dorupon from the\ndoor of his favorite brothel in the sleazy Coinwash district. The irony of how\nhe and Doru were both spending the evening before their reckoning was not\nlost on Lan.\nAfter the Fists picked up Doru, they would drive him to an undisclosed\nlocation. When they arrived, Hilo would call Lan at home. The Fists were\nunder orders not to hurt or kill Doru, not yet, not until Lan arrived. He’d been\nclear about this. He wanted to face the man he considered an uncle, and ask\nhim why, after so many years of faithful service, he’d betrayed the clan. Then\nLan would have to decide how to handle the Weather Man’s fate so Kaul Sen\nwas never the wiser.\nAs the inevitable hour drew closer, he felt unsure of his ability to do the\nright thing. Even now, knowing Doru was a traitor, he did not want to have\nthe old man killed. He could still remember Doru returning from business\ntrips with sweets for the Kaul grandchildren. He was guilted by the image of\nDoru and Kaul Sen playing chess in the courtyard. But betrayal so close, and\nat such a high level of the clan—it could not be forgiven. Was it possible,\nLan wondered, to be both a strong leader and a compassionate person, or\nwere those two things opposing forces, pushing each other away?\nWith the door closed and Yunni gone, Lan opened the combination safe\nand took out the rest of his jade. Another reason he’d stopped coming here as\noften: taking off and putting on so much jade was painful now—like being\ndunked in ice and then coals, or physically shaken as if he were a bug in a jar.\nLan fingered the beads around his neck, touching each one as if accounting\nfor them, then put on the belt and cuffs, heavy and further encrusted with the\njade he had won from Gam. He braced himself.\nA few seconds of delay, then the rush hit him hard, much harder than\nusual. The world tilted and folded. Lan’s body screamed in protest, his chest\nseizing. He fell to the floor and clutched the carpet with curled fingers.\nBreathe, breathe. Get yourself under control. He fought back a moan. This\nwas supposed to get better. The doctor had said that the damage Gam had\ninflicted was not permanent. But he still hadn’t healed, and on-and-off\nsymptoms of jade overexposure plagued him. The lingering injury from the"

But he still hadn’t healed, and on-and-off\nsymptoms of jade overexposure plagued him. The lingering injury from the\nduel, the increased jade load, general stress and sleep deprivation—they were\naggravating each other in a vicious cycle. Lan crawled onto the bed, reaching\nfor his jacket hanging from the post of the headboard. He felt around until he\nfound the rubber strip, vial, and syringe he’d tucked into the inside pocket\nand drew them out.\nThe room seemed to be attacking him, the walls pressing in too close. His\nsenses were wild, snapping in and out of focus. He caught a snippet of some\nangry conversation on the street outside as clear as if it were next to him. The\nnext second it was gone, but the texture of the bedsheets was so prickly it\nstung his skin. Lan pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes and grasped for\nthe control techniques he’d first learned in the Academy, ones he hadn’t\nneeded since he was a teenager. He tensed then relaxed every muscle in his\nbody, slowly counting out the rhythm of his breaths, until he’d pushed every\nfeeling back to a tolerable distance and his hands no longer shook. Sitting on\nthe pillow with his back against the headboard, he tied off his arm, uncapped\nthe needle, drew the contents of the vial into the syringe, and hesitated.\nThe shock and disbelief he’d seen on Anden’s face filled his memory. So\ndid the shame Lan had felt that day, knowing he’d profoundly damaged the\nyoung man’s admiration and trust in him. Lan shared his cousin’s disgust; he\nhated needles, and he despised SN1. He loathed resorting to it for the jade\ntolerance he’d always taken for granted. He was doing all he could to combat\nthe manufacture and spread of the poison, and yet here he was, carrying a vial\nof it around with him, nestled against his chest like a tiny explosive. The\nagony of having to justify himself to Anden had caused Lan to go without an\ninjection for days. He knew that wasn’t how you were supposed to use the\ndrug, but each time he waited as long as he could, thinking that finally he was\ngetting better and no longer needed to resort to its use—and then the\nedginess, the perceptual distortions, the sweats and racing heart would start\nup once more.\nTomorrow he’d go back to Dr. Truw, get checked over again, see if there\nwasn’t something else he could do to hasten natural healing and build his\ntolerance back up to where he could carry his jade without chemical help.\nPerhaps he ought to take the risk of leaving Hilo in charge for a little while—\na worrisome idea, but one that would allow him to get away to Marenia for a\nweek, where he could wear a little less jade and recover his health. Tonight,\nthough, he couldn’t be weak. He needed to be at his most clearheaded and\ndecisive. There was no room to be mentally addled or emotionally volatile\nwhen you were sending a man to his death.\nLan slid the needle into his vein and emptied the contents of the syringe\ninto his arm.

He untied the rubber tourniquet and closed his eyes. The drug\ncirculated up into his brain and in minutes cleared it like a television antenna\nfinally finding a signal and resolving flickering static into a clear image.\nCopious jade energy hummed through him, but it was steady and under\ncontrol, waiting to be manipulated by his will. His senses were sharp as glass\nbut consistent and coordinated, no longer blasting in and out of focus. He felt\ngood. Powerful. He could leap to a second-story balcony or raise a Deflection\nthat would move a car. Lan allowed himself a moment of amazement.\nDespite his moral objections to SN1 and all it stood for, it truly was a\nremarkable drug. No wonder the foreigners wanted it so badly. No wonder\nAyt Mada wanted the fortune that could be made from selling it to them.\nLan stowed the items back into his pocket, then finished dressing and let\nhimself out of the room. In the lobby downstairs, he waved aside Mrs. Sugo’s\nsugary inquiries as to whether he was satisfied with his visit, reassuring her\nthat he was, but unfortunately could not stay to enjoy himself further. He had\nto get back to the house before Hilo called and someone else picked up the\nphone.\nHaving sent Woon home and knowing the Horn was occupied following\nhis instructions, Lan had not bothered telling anyone he was going out for a\nfew hours. He’d opted to take a cab and leave his car in the garage to avoid\nany attention. The drive to and from the Lilac Divine passed only through\nundisputed No Peak territories so there was little danger. Outside, he flagged\ndown another taxi and asked the driver to take him back to the house.\nBero’s heart was hammering in his chest, but his hands were steady as he\nbrought the Fullerton gun from the passenger side floor onto his lap and\nreadied himself to fling open the door. The call had come from Mudt half an\nhour ago, and the driver and car had appeared in front of his aunt’s apartment\nbuilding fifteen minutes after that. “It has to be tonight,” Mudt had said.\nEverything was happening very quickly, but Bero was fine with that. The\nsooner the better. There were two bouncers and several expensive cars parked\nin front of the elegant, dusky red facade of the Lilac Divine but no silver\nRoewolfe. Bero spoke over his shoulder. “You ready, keke?” From the seat\nbehind him, Cheeky made a nervous noise of assent.\nA man emerged from the Lilac Divine, a man Bero would recognize\nanywhere. As he watched in astonishment, one hand on the door handle, Kaul\nLan, the Pillar of the No Peak clan, got into the back of a taxi. The taxi pulled\ninto the street almost directly in front of them.\nBero was frozen for a second. Then everything fell into place for him. He\nspun forward in his seat to yell at the driver. “Follow that cab. Come on, go!\nDrive!”\n“What are you doing?” Cheeky shouted, pulling his partly open door shut\nas the vehicle began moving. “We’re supposed to be shooting up the club!\nThat’s what they told us to do!”"

Because the fucking Pillar of No Peak was\nthere, that’s why! And now he’s in that taxi. He’s who the Mountain wants.\nThere’s no point hitting the Lilac Divine if he’s not there!” Bero was not only\ncertain of this, he was convinced that fate was shining on him at this instant,\noffering him the opportunity he’d been waiting for, something even better\nthan what he’d been promised. “This is it, keke,” he said. “Our big chance.”\nDo a good job, make a big impression, show just how valuable you can be\nto the clan—those had been the goateed Green Bone’s words. What could\npossibly make a bigger impression, what could be of greater value, than\ntaking out Kaul Lan himself?\nBero grinned, a little madly. It was not hard for him to call to mind the\nmemory of Kaul Lan’s dismissive, compassionate disdain. Tonight, the Pillar\nof No Peak would realize how badly he’d underestimated Bero. Fate worked\nin mysterious and beautiful ways.\n“Okay,” Bero hissed. “At the next stoplight, pull up beside the cab.”\nThe driver was a lumpy-faced, heavyset fellow who hadn’t said a word all\nnight. Either he was too dumb to be perturbed, or considered drive-by\nmachine gun shootings to be unremarkable in his line of work. Who knew\nwhere Mudt had found him. He didn’t even respond now, merely shrugged at\nBero’s direction and sped up to close the gap to the taxi.\n“You’re out of your mind. The fucking Pillar of the No Peak clan.”\nCheeky’s voice wavered on panic. He muttered, “We’re worm food, keke,”\nbut still he cranked down his window. They readied themselves to thrust the\nbarrels of the Fullertons out the right-hand side of the car and open fire. It\nwould be fast, and very loud, and very messy.\nLan noticed the black car following him. It wasn’t the car itself he noticed\nfirst; from the distance of a city block, his heightened Perception sensed the\nunmistakable hostility and fear directed squarely at him. Lan glanced over his\nshoulder and watched the vehicle take a turn after them, maintaining a two-\ncar-length distance behind the taxi. He turned back around to face forward,\nthen stretched out and focused his Perception.\nThree men. The driver’s energy was cool and dull; the other two were\nburning flares of excitable aggression and fear. No jade auras. Not Green\nBones, then. Common criminals, or hired grunts. Lan’s mouth twisted. He\nremoved cash from his wallet—enough to cover the cab bill and then some—\nand leaned forward, handing it to the driver. “This is far enough,” he said.\n“Take a U-turn at the next light and drop me off at the corner. Then keep\nyour head down and get out of here.”\nThe taxi suddenly shot ahead and spun into a U-turn."

He’s getting out of the\ncab.”\n“Turn around!” Bero yelled at the driver. “Turn around before he gets\naway.” There was already traffic blocking line of sight between the two cars.\nThe driver lost several seconds before taking a sharp turn up to the curb\nwhere Kaul had gotten out. The taxi was already driving down the street and\nthe Green Bone was nowhere in sight. Fuck! Bero opened the door and\njumped out onto the sidewalk, swinging his head back and forth, trying to see\nwhere their target had gone.\n“What do you think you’re doing now?” Cheeky hissed at him from the\nopen car window. “Kaul’s gone. We’re not going to chase after him on foot.\nGet back in, before someone sees you standing there holding a fucking Fully\ngun. We can still go back to the club, do the job they told us to do.”\nHe couldn’t see Kaul in either direction on the sidewalk. The street\nbordered a steeply descending embankment. Bero ran to the railing and\nlooked over, remembering in despair how fast Green Bones could move. The\nclumpy grass and dirt sloped down into darkness, all the way to the unlit pier\nwhere the silhouettes of small moored sailboats lined the edge of the harbor.\nFrustration welled behind Bero’s straining eyes. This was going all wrong,\nnot according to plan at all.\nThen, miraculously, as if destiny had turned his face and made his eyes\nland on just the right spot, he saw a figure walking along the boardwalk by\nthe water. It was too dark to tell for certain that it was Kaul, but Bero knew it\nwas him. The set of his body, the way he walked—Bero shouted in triumph.\n“I see him!”\nCheeky cursed and scrambled from the car. He leaned over the railing and\nstared at where Bero was pointing. “Forget it, keke. He’s too far away now,\nand he already knows we’re on to him. We’ll get him another time.”\n“There won’t be another time!” Kaul would get wise. He’d travel with his\nbodyguards or change his routine. In any case, after this failure, the goateed\nGreen Bone would brush Bero aside as unworthy, just another disappointing\nwannabe—and take away his chance at jade.\nBero slung the strap of the Fully gun over his shoulder and clambered\nover the railing. “Stay here if you like,” he said. “When I come back with\nKaul’s head, I’ll tell them what a thin-blooded coward you were. You better\nget out of town.”\nCheeky was a pussy, just like Sampa, but the difference was that he\ncouldn’t stand to be called out on it; Bero had figured that out early on. Bero\ndropped to the other side of the railing and started sliding and scrambling\ndown the hill as fast as he was able to with a heavy weapon weighing him"

He was sure Cheeky would swear a bit and\nfollow him, and even if he didn’t, Bero didn’t care—he wasn’t going to give\nup and let his one golden chance slip away.\nThe goateed Green Bone had promised him a pebble of jade for gunning\nthe Lilac Divine, but if he killed Kaul Lan—the Pillar of the No Peak clan!—\nhell, Kaul’s jade was his by right. Green Bones took jade from the bodies of\ntheir enemies, everyone knew that.\nLan had vaulted the railing and leapt Lightly down the steep embankment to\nthe empty wooden walkway that ran along the harbor. He straightened his\njacket and walked, leaving his pursuers behind. He wasn’t worried about\nthem following. His Perception was incredible, the strongest and clearest it\nhad ever been. He could sense the confusion and disarray he’d left behind\nand was sure the goons were not even professionals. They’d been hired to\ntake a run at him. Lan was almost insulted.\nHe was also aggravated by the idea that he and his family might not be as\nsafe inside No Peak territory as he’d assumed. During foreign occupation a\ngeneration ago, Kekonese rebels had been masters of guerrilla fighting, sneak\nattacks, and constant low-level harassment. Hilo had told him about the\norganized thieving in the Docks; the Mountain clan was almost certainly\nbehind it, and Lan was sure this was part of the same thing—an ongoing\neffort to wear No Peak down, to distract and overwhelm its leaders. Their\nenemies were feigning peaceableness, refusing to show themselves while\nhiding behind the activities of common criminals who were reckless and\nstupid enough to do their bidding. It had the makings of a patient war based\non tactics that Ayt Yu and Kaul Sen would have approved of against\nShotarians, but it was entirely counter to the tradition of open duel between\nGreen Bones in dispute with each other. It was offensive and disrespectful. It\nangered Lan, and he could see why it infuriated Hilo.\nPerhaps he ought to go back and kill these men. He didn’t have time for\nthat, though, and he didn’t want to create a scene that would slow him down\nright now. There were bigger problems to deal with tonight, and he was\nsupposed to be in his study awaiting Hilo’s call. Lan walked faster. The\nboardwalk stretched all the way down near where the General’s Ride passed\nunder the KI-1 freeway. There, he could climb back up to street level and hail\nanother taxi to take him home unmolested.\nHe was nearly there when his chest began to hurt. It was a sudden,\nconstricting pain, as if his diaphragm had been seized in a huge fist. Lan\nslowed, alarmed, as he put a hand to his sternum. Nothing moved in the near\ndarkness. The streetlight from the road above illuminated only the flat shapes\nof sampans and the masts of junks bobbing ever so slightly, the water\nslapping gently against their hulls.\nLan felt abruptly confused, as if he’d stepped from one place into an"

He shook his head, trying to\nget his bearings back. What was going on? What was he doing here? His\nbreaths were growing short and shallow, and he wondered why his heart was\npattering irregularly.\nHe was at the docks. Trying to get home. He’d left the Lilac Divine,\ngotten into a taxi, been followed … that’s why he’d left the cab and was\ndown here. Why had it all escaped him so completely for a second back\nthere? He took several more steps forward and staggered, unsteady on his\nfeet. Something was wrong. A fog was descending over him, siphoning the\nclarity from his mind, the strength from his body. He felt warm and flushed,\nbut when he put a hand to his brow he found he was not sweating; his skin\nwas fever hot and dry.\nThese weren’t jade-related symptoms; they weren’t anything he’d\nexperienced before. It occurred to him that perhaps he was having a stroke or\na heart attack. Then the more obvious explanation struck him: the injection of\nSN1 he’d taken a few minutes ago. How many days had it been since his\nprevious injection? Eight? Nine? After that long an abstention, he should’ve\ntaken a half dose. He must’ve been distracted and rushed and taken a full\ndose instead.\nLan tried to focus. He had to get to the street and find a phone right away.\nHe’d taken the precaution of keeping SN1 counteractant in the house; he\nsimply needed to get back there. He put one foot in front of the other,\nmisjudging the distance to the ground and stumbling. His fists clenched. He\ncould do this; he willed himself to. The street was not far, and he was a Kaul\n—his father had once spent three days crawling through the jungle with a\nbullet in his back. Lan fixed his eyes ahead. He forced steadiness into his\nbreath and took another step, then another. His mind cleared, his gait\nsteadied.\nA noise behind him made him turn. Lan was astounded, not just by the\nfact that the two men—no, teenagers—from the black car had followed him,\nbut that, in his state, they’d been able to sneak up to within fifty meters\nwithout him noticing. When he turned, the boys stopped and a second of\nsilent immobility passed. The taller youth on the right fumbled with the bolt\nof his Fullerton machine gun, but it was the sallow, crooked-faced teen on the\nleft that made Lan stare in incredulity. “You?”\nThey opened fire.\nA detonation of bewilderment and rage burst in Lan’s skull. Enough.\nEnough with this. He brought his arms up—unleashing Steel and Deflection\ntogether in a massive expulsion of jade energy. The teenagers were not very\ngood shots; adrenaline and fear made them worse. Bullets tore up the wooden\nplanks around Lan’s feet, zinged into the air above, chopped into the hulls of\nboats, and even sent up rows of tiny splashes in the water. The ones that"

Just\nas he’d taught Anden, Lan gathered them into the sucking wake of his\nDeflection, whipped them around and hurled them back out like a fistful of\nthrown marbles.\nThey did not have the deadly speed and accuracy of bullets fired from a\ngun, but they were still dangerous. One of his attackers dropped the Fully\ngun, clutching his arm, the other took lead to the knees and went down with a\ncry, his weapon clattering to the boardwalk. Lan was already moving, faster\nthan shadow. Blazing with Strength, he struck one gunman in the throat,\ncrushing his windpipe before he hit the ground. He turned to the other youth,\nthe one whose life he’d spared six months ago. The wounded teenager was\ntrying to bring his weapon back up with his left arm. Lan tore the gun away,\nbent the barrel in his hands, and flung it aside. The boy scrambled backward,\nhis face an openmouthed white oval as fear finally overtook reckless greed.\n“You want this, do you?” Lan held up the jade beads around his neck.\n“You think it’s worth dying for. You think it’ll make you someone you’re\nnot.” He reached to grab the fool by his hair and pull him forward, to break\nhis neck like a duck’s, as Hilo had intended before. “You’re stupid, then. Too\nstupid to live.”\nHis hand closed on air as his legs suddenly buckled beneath him. Lan\ncollapsed, his body engulfed in an agony of heat raging under the surface of\nhis skin. The pain in his chest returned, redoubled, emptied his mind of\nthought.\nThe teenager backpedaled, staring with wide, confused eyes. Then he\nturned and ran. His footsteps reverberated like cymbal crashes in Lan’s\nhollow chamber of a skull. Lan didn’t notice. He couldn’t breathe. His mouth\nwas dry; his throat was burning up. He needed to make it stop. Put out the\nfire. Fire was like jade, and greed, and war, and unfulfilled expectations—\nconsuming what it touched. Water. Get to the water.\nThe world was dulling. He was crashing out rapidly now, as if his jade\nwas being ripped away from him all at once. He felt frantically for the beads\naround his neck, the cuffs around his arms—he still had every stone. Get up,\nhe urged himself. Keep going. He heaved himself back up and took a few\nmore steps. Lan had once run lightly on thin beams across the Academy’s\ntraining grounds, but now he lost his balance and put a foot down too close to\nthe edge of the pier. He pitched over, and when he hit the water, it was such\nan instant cold and silent relief that he didn’t struggle when the silence closed\nover his head.\nSECOND INTERLUDE\nThe One Who Returned\nT\nhe most well-known scripture of the Deitist religion, the Pact of the\nReturn, is the story of a pious man named Jenshu, who, a very long time ago,\nspoke out against the evils of a despotic king and was forced to leave his"

He packed his large family, including his younger brothers and sisters\nand their families, on a great ship and went in search of the fabled ruins of the\noriginal jade palace on earth.\nAfter forty years of sailing the earth, stopping but never settling, aided by\nsome gods and hampered by others, surviving adventures that would form the\nbasis for many myths in Kekonese culture, Jenshu and his clan arrived on a\nlush and unspoiled island. Impressed by his dedication and piousness, Yatto,\nthe Father of All, spoke to Jenshu, who was by now an old man, and led him\ninto the mountains where he found stones of jade: the remains of the divine\nhome once meant for humankind. A gift from the gods.\nWhile his family constructed a village by the shore, Jenshu retired to a\nhermit’s life of meditation in the mountains. Surrounded by jade, Jenshu\ndeveloped and mastered godlike wisdom and abilities, growing ever closer to\na state of divine virtue. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren would\nseek him out to ask for his help, and he would emerge briefly from his\nisolation to settle disputes, quell earthquakes, beat back storms, and repel\nbarbarian invaders. When he was three hundred years old, the gods agreed\nthat Jenshu alone, of all their human descendants, deserved to be brought\nhome to Heaven.\nDevout Kekonese Deitists consider themselves the descendants of Jenshu\nand closest in favor to the gods. Green Bones who practice the religion today\ntrace their way of life to Jenshu’s favorite nephew, Baijen, who went into the\nmountains to learn from his uncle and, after Jenshu’s departure from the\nearth, became the protector of the island’s people, the first and fiercest jade\nwarrior in island legend. While all Kekonese revere Jenshu as the One Who\nReturned, only Green Bones consider themselves close enough to his legacy\nto refer to him simply as “Old Uncle.”\nUpon Jenshu’s ascendance, the gods further proclaimed that when the rest\nof humankind followed Jenshu’s example and achieved the four Divine\nVirtues of humility, compassion, courage, and goodness, then they, too,\nwould be welcomed back to godliness. All Deitists believe in this final\npromised occurrence, which they call the Return.\nCHAPTER\n32\nThe Other One Who Returned\nT\nhe phone call came before dawn, waking Shae on the morning of the day\nshe’d expected to go to the family house for dinner with her grandfather and\nbrothers. When she picked up the phone, she was astounded to hear Hilo’s\nvoice.\n“Stay where you are,” he said. “I’m sending a car to pick you up.”\n“Hilo?” For a second, she was not sure it was him.\n“You have to come to the house, Shae.”\n“Why?

She\nsqueezed the phone receiver. “Hilo? If you won’t talk to me, hand the phone\nto Lan.”\nSomething in the pause that followed filled her with the truth a split\nsecond before she heard the words. “Lan’s dead.”\nShae sat down. The phone cord pulled taut and Hilo’s words stretched thin\nas thread, barely reaching her from the other side of a vast gulf.\n“They got him last night at the Docks. Workers found his body in the\nwater. Drowned.”\nShe was staggered by the depth of her grief, the suddenness with which it\narrived. “Send the car. I’ll be ready,” she said. She hung up and waited.\nWhen Hilo’s large white Duchesse Priza pulled up in front of the apartment\nbuilding, she walked out without locking the door or turning out the light.\nShe got into the back seat.\nMaik Kehn turned over his shoulder, sliding her a look of compassion so\nsincere she would have wept, if it had not been too early for that yet.\n“I need to stop by the bank,” she said.\nMaik said, “I’m supposed to take you straight home.”\n“It’s important. Hilo will understand.”\nMaik nodded and pulled the car away from the curb. She gave him\ndirections to the bank, and when they arrived, he parked and got out of the\ncar with her. He was loaded with weaponry—moon blade, talon knife, two\nhandguns. “You can’t come into the bank like that,” she said.\n“I’ll wait outside the door.”\nThe bank had just opened. Shae went in and requested access to her safe\ndeposit box. The manager said, “Of course, Miss Kaul, come with me,” and\nshowed Shae into the back room with its wall of small steel doors, then left\nher alone.\nShae had not unlocked her safe in two and a half years. When she turned\nthe key and opened the box, irrational fear gripped her for an instant. What if\nit was not there? But it was—her jade. All of it. Even before she reached\ninside, she felt the tug of its power setting off a tide in her blood like the\nmoon’s gravity pulling on the ocean. She counted every stone as she put on\nthe earrings, the bracelets up both her forearms, anklets, choker. Then she\nclosed the safe deposit box door and sat down on the ground, her back to the\nwall, and hugged her knees to her chest.\nIt had been so long since she’d worn jade that she felt the rush coming\nlike the wave of a tsunami looming before it engulfs the beach. She did not\ntense or cringe from it. She raced alongside and let it sweep her up in its\ninexorable path. She rode it high, let it carry her simultaneously above her\nown body and more deeply inside it. She was inside the storm; she was the\nstorm.

Her mind spun in elated disorientation—the kind that comes from\nreturning to an old house and opening the drawers, touching the walls, sitting\nin the furniture—remembering what was once forgotten. Guilt and doubt rose\nin opposition, then fell, carried swiftly away by the flood.\nShae got up. She walked out of the bank and back to the Duchesse with\nMaik Kehn. She got into the passenger side front seat, and Maik asked, “You\nwant me to take you to the house now, Kaul-jen?” Shae nodded.\nThey did not speak during the drive. Shae’s mind was being torn asunder\nso that her face and body did not know how to react. Someone observing her,\nsuch as Maik Kehn, who occasionally slid a glance in her direction, would\nthink that she was frozen, that she felt nothing at all.\nLan being dead opened a chasm of desolation in Shae so vast she could\nnot see the other side. Her eldest brother was the rock in the family, the one\nshe felt she could always count on no matter what. He had never been unkind\nor judging toward her, had always given his attention to her and respected her\neven though she was much younger than he was. She wanted to be alone with\nthe pain of her loss but also could not help reveling in the rediscovery of her\njade senses. The sense of euphoria in her own reclaimed power was\ninescapable—and it suffused her with terrible remorse. And all the while,\nanother part of her was thinking clearly, if feverishly, toward vengeance.\nWhen they arrived at the house, she walked past the sentries and found\nHilo standing in the kitchen, his hands leaning heavily on the table so his\nshoulder blades jutted up and his head seemed to hang between them. Like\nMaik, he dripped with weaponry. He appeared in control of himself, almost\nthoughtful, but his jade aura heaved and roiled with the fiery consistency of\nexplosive lava. Fists flanked him left and right, so the family kitchen was\ncrowded with ferocious, waiting men, the collective aura clamor of their jade-\nadorned bodies assaulting Shae’s reawakened sense of Perception so much so\nthat she paused to brace herself before entering.\nElsewhere in the house, she heard Kyanla quietly sobbing.\nHilo raised his head to look at her but didn’t move.\n“I’m going with you,” she said. “I know where we should go.”\nHilo straightened and came around the table toward her. She tried to see\ninto his eyes, but they were as black and distant as she felt. The Horn placed\nhis hands on her shoulders, and pulled her close, and laid his cheek against\nhers. “Heaven help me, Shae,” he whispered into her ear. “I’m going to kill\nthem all.”\nCHAPTER\n33\nDown from the Forest\nG\nont Asch spent most Sixthdays at the Silver Spur Cockfight Pit & Bar,\nwhich was owned by his cousin, a Lantern Man in the Mountain clan.

Excited shouts and disappointed groans rose from the\nbettors ringing the arena. Money exchanged hands as the referee lifted both\nbirds, depositing the twitching loser in a blue plastic bucket and handing the\nvictor back to his smiling trainer.\nThe arena and seating took up the main level of the Silver Spur. The open\nsecond floor contained the restaurant and bar where half the tables\noverlooked the action on the floor below and those without a direct view\ncould see the fights on the hanging closed-circuit televisions. In between\nwatching the matches, Gont was having a late lunch and talking business with\nthree of his Fists when a messenger barged through the door and ran straight\nup the stairs to his table with the news: Kaul Lan was dead, and Kaul Hilo\nwas coming here now to kill Gont himself.\nThe Horn was taken aback, but it didn’t show on his face. Gont was an\nexpert at keeping his thoughts and emotions to himself. Only his First Fist,\nWaun Balu, noticed the small shift in his expression—a flaring of the\nnostrils, the tightening of his mouth into a skeptical scowl. Gont looked\naround himself. He was in a building in the south Wallows, deep inside\nMountain territory, in broad daylight, surrounded by several of his Green\nBone warriors. Was Kaul really so insane as to try to attack him here?\nGont decided he was.\n“Call every Finger you have nearby,” he demanded of his Fists. “Clear the\npeople out of here. Send lookouts to either end of the street and guard the\ndoors.” His men scrambled to obey. Gont found his nephew and told him to\ntake their valuable birds out the back door and far away. The owner of the\nSilver Spur refused to flee with the customers, so Gont made him and his\nstaff lock themselves in the kitchen with a pair of shotguns pointed at the\ndoor.\nThe battle to come would be bloody. The second Kaul son was a heavily\njaded and ferocious fighter, and for all the Mountain’s internal assertions that\nNo Peak was in decline, Gont knew that it was still a formidable clan with\ncommitted young warriors. After the failed assassination attempt and the duel\nat the Factory, Ayt-jen had instructed everyone to be more careful, more\nfocused on the Mountain’s eventual goal. So Gont had not expected a violent\nshowdown so soon. As much as he looked forward to separating Kaul Hilo’s\nhead from his body, he wondered what had gone wrong, why their plans had\nfailed. No time for speculation now.\nGreen Bones filled the Silver Spur and its surrounding streets. In a few\nminutes, Gont had a total of fourteen men in and around the building—three\nFists and eleven Fingers. They took up positions near the door and in the\nupstairs windows. Half a dozen more jade warriors were gathering down the\nstreet in the Mountain-owned Brass Arms Hotel, where they would close in\nbehind the No Peak fighters and attack from the rear. Gont expected No Peak\nwould outnumber them, but this was Mountain turf and he held the advantage\nof ground.\nHe considered phoning his Pillar but decided against it. Reinforcements"

Reinforcements\nwould not arrive in time, and besides, he intended to meet and kill Kaul Hilo\nhimself.\nThe ruse was Shae’s idea.\nBefore she’d arrived at the house, Hilo had been ready to head straight\ninto the heart of Mountain territory to kill Gont and as many of his men as he\ncould. He’d already drunk a shot of hoji and cut his tongue on a knife with\nhis Fists—the traditional Green Bone ritual before undertaking a mission one\nexpected not to return from.\nShe faced him down from across the kitchen table the way she used to\nwhen they were children. “We have to be smarter than that. If we die today,\nthe Mountain wins.” They had to think ahead, even in this terrible time.\n“Gont will be ready and waiting for us. Even if we kill him, we won’t defeat\nthe Mountain. Won’t destroy it.”\nPerhaps this unfettered outburst of emotion, surging Shae’s jade aura with\na vehemence that Hilo could not ignore, forced the Horn back into thinking\nclearly. He looked at his most trusted senior Fists and saw some of them\nnodding at what Shae had said. He turned to her. “I wish to the gods it hadn’t\ntaken this to bring you back,” he said. “But you’re green, and one of us again,\nso tell me what you have in mind.”\nOnce she explained her idea, he smiled with a cold, satisfied\ndetermination and seized upon it with as much conviction as if it had been his\nown. He gave quick orders to his men, who sprang to carry them out. While\nthe Maik brothers organized the attack parties, Shae went to the armory room\nbehind the training hall to find herself some weapons. When she returned,\nHilo was sitting on the stairs with Wen, saying goodbye. Their heads were\nbent close together, and they were speaking quietly. Wen’s eyes were dry, but\nher fingers trembled as she smoothed Hilo’s hair behind one of his ears with\na tenderness that made Shae turn away, feeling like an intruder witnessing a\nprivate moment. She went to stand outside and watch as the Duchesse and\nfive other cars departed the estate.\nThe convoy of vehicles would be sighted entering the Lo Low Street\ntunnel, and word would reach Gont Asch that Kaul Hilo was on his way to\nseek a showdown at the Silver Spur. The Mountain would rush to mount a\ndefense while the Duchesse-led convoy took its time circling the Wallows\ndistrict before returning to No Peak territory.\nSeconds after the decoy cars exited the roundabout of the Kaul house, the\nMaiks and three other Fists pulled up in nondescript vehicles hastily\nborrowed from a nearby Lantern Man’s car dealership. Hilo came out. Gone\nwas the gentleness Shae had glimpsed earlier—he strode down the front\nsteps, then turned to face the house. There he fell to his knees and touched his\nhead to the concrete. The Horn rocked back and raised his face to the sky.\n“Can you hear me?” he bellowed, and Shae was not sure who he was\nscreaming at: his troops, the window of their grandfather’s room, the"

I’m ready to die. The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master.”\nShae had always strongly disliked Hilo’s penchant for dramatic gestures,\nbut she bowed her head and swallowed thickly at the sight of the assembled\nGreen Bones falling to their knees and crying out in a fervor, “Our blood for\nthe Horn!”\nThe three largest and most profitable betting houses in the city were the\nPalace of Fortune, the Cong Lady, and the Double Double. They were located\nside by side on the same strip of Poor Man’s Road in the south part of the\nArmpit still belonging to the Mountain. Ranking among the Mountain’s most\nwell-known holdings, they were where high-rolling Lantern Men conducted\nafter-hours deals and where the clan’s business and political associates were\nrewarded or bribed with luxury and entertainment. A fitting place for an\nunprecedented retribution.\nHilo had nodded in admiration of Shae’s choice: “Lan fought for the\nArmpit, and it’s ours by right—all of it.” They crossed Patriot Street with a\ndozen of No Peak’s strongest Fists. Shae took the Cong Lady with the four\nother fighters Hilo sent with her, while the Maiks stormed the Double Double\nwith another crew, and Hilo went with his team to destroy the Palace of\nFortune.\nThe whole thing felt like a violent fever dream to Shae. The car pulled up\nright in front of the casino; Shae got out and strode past the shocked valet\nattendant who shrank aside at the sight of them, past the lighted fountain with\nthe statue of the dancing lady in the center, up the marble steps to the\nrevolving glass doors. No hiding in the crowd now; the waning sunlight\nflashed on her jade bracelets, and fearfully expectant eyes followed her every\nmove. She felt sick with eagerness, and powerful in a way she hadn’t felt for\nyears. The foreigners were right: The Kekonese were savages. Lan had not\nbeen savage, not at heart, but he was dead now.\nThe senior Fist next to her, a gray-eyed man named Eiten, seemed unsure\nof how to deal with her presence. He was one of Hilo’s higher-ranked\nlieutenants, but she was a Kaul; he couldn’t decide whether to order her\naround or defer to her. “What’s the plan, Kaul-jen?” he asked just before they\nreached the doors.\nShe drew her moon blade and held it out to him; he spat on it for luck.\n“Kill anyone wearing jade,” she said.\nThat was simple enough to agree upon. Screams erupted when they came\nthrough the doors. Shae picked out the four other jade auras in the room like\na cobra sensing body heat. They stood out like beacons amid the rest of the\nirrelevant motion and noise. A couple of them had already Perceived the\nmurderous approach and were ready; they leapt upon the intruders at once\nwith drawn moon blades.\nIt had been years since Shae had last fought to kill.

For a few minutes on\nthe drive over here, she’d wondered if she still had the skills, the reflexes, the\ninstinct for it, or if two and a half years of jadelessness and peaceable\nEspenian life had ruined her.\nSo she was almost surprised when she cut the first man down in a few\nseconds. She deflected his first attack, white metal singing against white\nmetal, then made an obvious swing for his abdomen. The man Steeled and\ncurved his spine away from her attack. His head tilted forward with the\nmotion and Shae’s left hand whipped up to thrust her talon knife into his\nunprotected throat. She bounded Light over his body, yanking out the knife\nand already moving on to the next target.\nIt felt like an exercise at the Academy, another timed trial. Training and\nexperience took over. She became focused and efficient, and the jade energy\nplaying through her blood was like a song she hadn’t heard for a while but\nstill knew by heart. She fought another man on the first floor until Eiten cut\nhis throat from behind. Shae leapt Lightly onto the balcony of the second\nfloor.\nA woman Fist guarded the room where the staff had taken refuge. She\ngreeted Shae with a battery of hurled Deflections that overturned chairs, sent\ncards and betting chips into the air like confetti, and rattled the walls. Shae\nweaved through the barrage, scattering the attacks with her own Deflections,\nuntil she closed in and they matched talon knives in the narrow hallway. The\nwoman’s Steel could not be broken by the knife. In the end Shae landed a\ncrushing stomp kick to the woman’s kneecap. As her opponent buckled\nforward in agony, Shae dropped her elbow down on the back of the Fist’s\nhead with all the Strength she could summon, caving in the skull.\nWhen every Green Bone in the building was dead—six in all—they tore\nthe door to the back room off by its hinges, and Shae addressed the huddled,\ncowering staff members of the Cong Lady. “All the businesses on Poor\nMan’s Road are now the property of the No Peak clan,” she said. “You can\nleave now with your lives. Or you can swear allegiance and tribute and keep\nyour jobs with equal terms and pay under new management. Make your\nchoice quickly.”\nA quarter of the employees left—the ones too senior or too well\nconnected in the Mountain clan, who were truly loyal, or too frightened of the\nrepercussions if they turned. The rest stayed and recovered from the\ndisruption remarkably quickly; the Kekonese are accustomed to local changes\nof administration and treat them like natural disasters—incidents of sudden\nand unpreventable violence, the damage calmly dealt with afterward so\nbusiness can return to normal. Soon the remaining casino staff were busy\nrighting furniture, sweeping up broken glass, and blotting bloodstains before\nthey set into the expensive carpet or upholstery.\nShae gathered the jade from the enemy fighters she’d killed, then walked\noutside, leaving Eiten and the rest of Hilo’s men in charge.

She found her\nbrother on the street, shouting orders, pointing here and there with the tip of\nhis bloody talon knife, his face and aura bright with battle mania. The Double\nDouble was on fire—whether it had been set accidentally or deliberately, by\nthe Mountain as it fled or by an overzealous No Peak fighter, no one seemed\nable to tell. The smoke curled out of the upper-story windows, mingling with\nthe washed-out hues of the sky.\nHilo glanced at her as she approached, at the handful of jade she clutched,\nand his mouth moved in something that was not quite a smile. He turned his\nface back toward the melee—the fire, the running people, the intermittent\nsounds of continued fighting. Not just from Green Bones; people from the No\nPeak side of the Armpit were pouring across Patriot Street. There was\nshouting and clashing in the streets between civilians rallying in support of\none clan or another.\n“It’s not enough,” Hilo muttered. Shae was not sure what he was referring\nto—the amount of jade in her hands, the betting houses themselves, or the\nnumber of Mountain Green Bones killed that evening. She was too rattled to\nrespond.\nIt took another thirty minutes for the fire in the Double Double to be put\nout and for the chaos to fade into the silence of an eerie aftermath. At some\npoint, when the sun sank out of the smoky sky, Hilo organized his people to\ncarry on through the night, and Shae ended up in the rear seat of a car headed\nback to the Kaul house. It was all a blur to her by that point, a surreal art\nhouse film of revenge and brutality.\nGont Asch took the phone call in silence, but every one of his men with any\nskill in Perception shifted away from him. Gont felt cold with astonishment.\nThen his neck flushed red with rage.\nTwenty-one members of the Mountain clan were dead in the surprise\nattack, Fingers and junior Fists who’d hastened to defend the trio of betting\nhouses on Poor Man’s Road but were no match for the killers Kaul Hilo had\nassembled from No Peak. A couple of foolish Lantern Men who had fired on\nthe attackers were in the hospital. Every square inch of the Armpit was under\nNo Peak control. It was an outbreak of clan-on-clan violence such as Janloon\nhad never seen.\nGont hung up. For several seconds he was motionless. Then he tore the\nphone and its casing off the wall and hurled it across the room with such\nforce that it embedded into the far wall on the other side of the Silver Spur.\nHis men froze, shocked by the uncharacteristic outburst.\n“Kaul Lan is dead,” Gont said. “His family has come down from the\nforest. We are now at open war with No Peak. Their lives and livelihoods are\nfor the taking, and jade goes to the victor.”\nCHAPTER\n34\nYou Owe the Dead\nS\nhae was confused when she woke up.

When she opened her eyes, the\nmoonlight dimly illuminating her room revealed a pile of bloodstained\nclothing and weapons on the floor next to her old globe lamp and a stack of\npaperback novels. She realized she’d crawled under the covers in nothing but\nher underwear—and her jade.\nEverything came back to her then. Lan’s death, putting on her jade and\nweapons, going with Hilo to wreak brutal vengeance on Poor Man’s Road.\nFrom deep inside a pressure built and expanded like a balloon inside a box,\nuntil a great sob ripped itself from her chest. She curled tightly onto her side,\nsqueezing the pillow to her face, and wept, long and hard, until she ran out of\ntears and energy. Then she lay still, breathing raggedly, and took stock of her\nnew and terrible reality.\nShe’d been possessed. It was the only explanation—or perhaps merely an\nexcuse. A dam that had been straining under hairline fractures had burst\ninside her yesterday, and instead of feeling appalled, she’d welcomed the\nfinal destruction, had reveled in it, in the sweet power of jade and the frenzy\nof violent retribution.\nIn the cold clarity of the aftermath, however, she felt numb. She’d done\nsomething irreversible last night, equally cowardly and brave, and she\nwondered if this mixture of sadness, strange elation, and calm acceptance was\nwhat one would feel in the moments of free fall after jumping off a high\nbridge. One could not change fate after such a decision, only own the choice\nand anticipate its inevitable outcome. This thought, somehow, calmed her,\nand slowly her body unclenched.\nPerception told her she was not the only one awake. Now that she could\nonce again sense jade auras as automatically as she discerned color, it seemed\nunthinkable that she would never again feel the cool, heavy texture of Lan’s\npresence. Yet there it was—a truth more immutable and unforgiving than\ngravity on a falling body.\nShae got out of bed and turned on a lamp. In her closet, she found an old\nT-shirt and a pair of sweatpants—clothes she hadn’t bothered to move out.\nSlowly, she dressed herself. Her body and mind were sore. Regular training\nwas still not the same as carrying and fighting with jade. She had dark bruises\nand shallow cuts she hadn’t noticed at all last night, and she suspected it\nwould be more than a week before she could move or extend any jade\nabilities without pain. In the mirror over the dresser, she saw that she looked\nbattered and weary, more like a victim of domestic abuse than a Green Bone\nwarrior, except for the jade on her arms, her ears, her neck.\nShe walked out of the room and down the unlit hall toward the glow of a\nsingle light emanating from downstairs. It was still dark out. The only sounds\nin the eerily quiet house were the ticking of the clock, and the clinking of a\nspoon against ceramic. They seemed deafening.

His sheathed\nmoon blade was propped against one of the other chairs, and his stained talon\nknife lay on the granite kitchen counter. He had not shaved, nor slept by the\nlooks of it, but he was eating breakfast so calmly one might have been fooled\ninto thinking nothing at all was out of the ordinary.\nShae sat down silently in the seat opposite him.\n“There’s a pot on the stove if you want some,” he said after some time.\n“Kyanla made it yesterday, but no one ate it. It’s still good, just add a little\nwater.”\n“Where is everyone?” Shae’s voice sounded dry. “Where’s Grandda?”\nHilo pointed the handle of his spoon up to the ceiling. “In his room.\nProbably still sedated. Kyanla had to call the doctor yesterday while we were\ngone. Sounds like he gave the old man some strong stuff to calm him down.”\nShae croaked, “What’s wrong with him?”\n“He’s old and crazy.” Hilo turned darkened eyes on her. “He had a\nbreakdown when he heard about Lan. He thought he was back in the war, and\nit was Du that had been killed—he’s been ranting and raving about the\nShotarians. Doesn’t recognize me. When he does, he blames me—says I’m\nthe reason Lan’s dead.”\nHilo said it with a flat affect to his voice, but Shae was not fooled. She\nwanted to rush up to see her grandfather, but if she got up now, Hilo would\nbe hurt and it seemed dangerous to hurt him right now. Their grandfather had\nalways been kinder to Shae than to her brothers, and he had always been the\nleast kind to Hilo.\nHilo went back to eating, and she wondered, How can he even eat right\nnow? She hadn’t eaten in over a day but had no appetite at all; she wasn’t\nsure she ever would again. “What about everyone else?”\n“They’re busy, Shae,” he said. “We’re stretched thin. I left Kehn in charge\nof the mess. I sent Tar running around the city to make sure we’re defended\nelsewhere.”\nShae sat up as something else occurred to her. “Where’s Doru?”\nHilo’s lips went crooked. “The traitor? We picked him up that night, you\nknow; Lan was supposed to meet us, to handle it himself. I called but\ncouldn’t reach him; no one knew where he was. That’s when I knew\nsomething was wrong.”\n“Did you kill Doru?”\nHilo shook his head. “That was going to be Lan’s call. So what was I\nsupposed to do with the old ferret? Anyway, I stripped him of his jade and\nlocked him in his house under guard. He’s been there ever since. No phones,\nno visitors.”\nStripped of jade. What abject humiliation for an elderly Green Bone\nwho’d once been the trusted confidant of the Torch of Kekon. Despite her\nhatred for the man, Shae imagined him in the advanced throes of jade\nwithdrawal, watched over by Hilo’s unsympathetic men in his own house,"

But he’s no longer Weather Man; I’ve made that clear to\nthe clan.”\nOnly then did the realization truly strike her. Hilo was the Pillar.\nShe stared at her brother. There had never been a Pillar under the age of\nthirty. Hilo was barely older than she; he’d been the youngest Horn in\nmemory. There he sat, blood-spattered and reeking of fire smoke, eating a\nbowl of cereal after having led a massacre. His aura had the sharp edge of\nnew jade he’d taken. Shae reeled. This will be the end, she thought. This will\nbe the end of the No Peak clan.\nHilo’s spoon clattered into his empty bowl. The chair scraped back loudly\nas he got up from the table. He probably didn’t even need to Perceive her\nemotional reaction—it was on her face—but he said nothing. The new Pillar\nplaced his dishes in the kitchen sink, then washed and dried his hands. He\ngrabbed a chair and pulled it up in front of Shae’s, then sat back down and\ntook her by the elbows, their knees touching.\n“They’ll come after us now,” he said. “With everything they have.”\n“Yes,” she agreed. Ayt Mada might have bargained with Lan. After last\nnight, after what Shae and Hilo had done, there would be no mercy. The\nMountain would come down from the forest and would not rest until the\nremaining Kauls were dead. Their closest allies would be executed; this\nhouse would be burned to the ground. The remnants of the clan would be\nabsorbed into the Mountain.\n“I need you, Shae.” The strain on Hilo was showing at last; every line of\nhis face looked sharper than before. “I know we haven’t always agreed. I\nknow I’ve said things, gone too far at times—only ever because you’re my\nsister, and I love you. Even if you’re still angry with me, I know you care\nabout the clan. Grandda built it, and Lan died for it, and now I need your\nhelp. I can’t do this without you.” His grip on her tightened; he bent forward\nand tilted his head to look up into her downcast face, his unwavering gaze a\nsolemn plea. “Shae. I need you to be my Weather Man.”\nOnly a few days ago, she’d insisted to Anden that she’d put clan issues\nand the life of a Green Bone behind her.

Who else in the clan could stand up to Hilo? Who else could\nmoderate him, could keep him from getting himself killed and taking the clan\ndown with him? Lan’s spirit would never be at peace if that happened. It’s\nnot true that the dead don’t care, Shae thought. You owe the dead.\nShae slid slowly from the chair and knelt on the cold kitchen tile. She\nraised clasped hands to her forehead. “The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is\nits master. On my honor, my life, and my jade.”\nCHAPTER\n35\nAn Unexpected Reception\nT\nhe one thing Bero was not short on was cash. There was an all-night clinic\nin the Forge, one of a few in the city where doctors of questionable training\npatched up wounds with no questions asked so long as one could pay for the\nservice. In the early morning after the events at the pier, at roughly the same\ntime that Kaul Lan’s body was being found, Bero sat on a steel table under a\nbuzzing strip of fluorescent light while a wrinkled man with watery eyes and\nstrings of hair like dirty floss pulled two shallowly embedded bullets from his\narm and bandaged him up, unrolling the gauze with such slow deliberation\nBero wanted to smack him. He’d spent hours huddled in the bushes under a\nfreeway overpass and felt quite mad by now.\nBy the time he got out of the clinic, the news was raging through the city.\nBero overheard it while standing in line to buy a meat bun and soda from the\nfirst convenience store he found. Kaul Lan, Pillar of No Peak, was dead—\nsuspected to have been assassinated by the Mountain.\nBero’s pulse pounded wildly; he was confused, but a grin rapidly began to\nspread across his face and he had to force it down. It was only luck—the\nsweet, merciful luck of the gods—that he was alive at all while that dumb\nturd Cheeky was dead, but now Bero was certain that even more luck was\nshowering down on him. It had been dark and he’d run in a panic. He hadn’t\nnoticed it, but Kaul must have been hit by the barrage of gunfire after all;\nhe’d just taken longer than usual to die. Which meant he—Bero—had killed\nthe Pillar of No Peak! He began to grin again. No one else, not a single Green\nBone in the city, could say that. He kicked himself for running, for not\nreturning to the pier to check.\nIt took him the better part of the day to get all the way back to the Goody\nToo at the far south end of Junko. He bought new clothes and a hat and threw\nthe old ones in a trash bin; then he walked, not trusting anyone, including cab\nor bus drivers, in case any witnesses had seen him last night and the clan was\nsearching for him. This was loyal No Peak territory and many people were\nupset.

The sight warmed Bero more, put a spring into his weary\nsteps. These people on the street, they’d lynch him if they knew what he’d\ndone. They’d string him up, cut him to pieces, light his remains on fire.\nOn his third attempt at knocking, Mudt opened the back door of the\nGoody Too. He stared aghast at Bero as if he were a ghost, then yanked him\ninside by the arm and shut the door. “Go out front and keep watch; shout if\nyou see anyone coming,” Mudt yelled over his shoulder at his son, who put\ndown the box he was carrying and hurried to do as he was told. Mudt turned\nback to Bero. “What the fuck happened?”\n“I did it,” Bero said. “I killed Kaul.”\nTo his surprise, Mudt looked horrified. “Where’s Cheeky?”\n“Cheeky’s dead.”\nMudt’s mouth moved like an airless carp’s. Finally, he said, “Fuck the\ngods. Fuck.” He paced back and forth a few times, shaky fingers pulling at\nhis wiry mop of hair. He spun on Bero with suddenness. “You have to get out\nof here now.”\nBero grew angry. This was not the reception he’d expected. “What for? I\nspent the whole godsdamned day walking here. You don’t know what kind of\nnight I’ve had. I did it; I killed Kaul. So pick up the phone and call him—that\nGreen Bone. I did what he asked, and I want in now. I want my jade; I\ndeserve it, no question now.”\n“You dumb fuck,” Mudt spat. “No one told you to kill Kaul. You were\nsupposed to shoot up the Lilac Divine and drive away. Give Kaul a scare in\nhis own territory, ruin his car and one of his favorite businesses, piss him off,\nnot kill him. The idea that you two half-wits could kill a Green Bone like\nKaul Lan …” Mudt gave a derisive snorting laugh. Soberly, “We’re fucked.”\n“The Mountain wants Kaul dead, don’t it?” Bero demanded, refusing to\nbelieve what he was hearing. “Make a big statement, that’s what the Green\nBone said we were supposed to do. You telling me you never thought we\ncould do it?”\n“A man with as much jade as the Pillar? You’re not going to take him out\nwith a Fully gun spray from two kids who can barely shoot straight! We\nfigured you’d cause a panic, maybe hit a few bystanders, and be lucky to get\naway alive. I don’t even know how it’s possible that you did it, how you’re\neven here …” Mudt trailed off in disbelief, then seized Bero by the upper arm\nand began pulling him across the back room cluttered with boxes, papers, and\ncleaning supplies.\nBero yanked his arm away. “What’re you doing?”\nMudt opened a closet door. He pushed aside a wheeled filing cabinet and\nrolled aside a flap of carpet to reveal a trapdoor in the floor. “He already"

He pushed aside a wheeled filing cabinet and\nrolled aside a flap of carpet to reveal a trapdoor in the floor. “He already\nphoned once, asking if you’d come back here,” Mudt said, tugging on a big\nbrass ring to pull the door open. “He’ll come back around here today, any\nminute now. If he finds you, you’re a dead man, keke. If you’re lucky, they’ll\njust kill you for screwing things up. If you’re not, they’ll hand you over to No\nPeak as an offering. Though it’s probably too late for any of that; they say No\nPeak’s Horn is already on the warpath …”\n“So you’re saying I should run?”\n“Gods, you really are missing some lights upstairs, aren’t you?” Mudt\nmuttered. He pointed down into the opening in the floor. “I don’t think\nanyone saw you come in, and better not to take any chances on them seeing\nyou leave. The tunnel goes all the way down under Summer Park and lets out\nnear the water. Dead useful for smuggling, and it’ll be dry this time of year.\nIf you’re lucky enough to have lived this long, maybe you’ll be lucky enough\nto get the hell out of Janloon.”\n“Out of Janloon?” Bero exclaimed. “How?”\n“I’m not helping you there, keke,” Mudt said. “This is as much as I’m\ndoing. If the Mountain finds out I’m even doing this, they’d cut my tongue\nout for starters.” He paled. “Goodbye jade, goodbye shine, goodbye eating\nsolid food.”\nBero squinted at Mudt. “Then why’re you doing it?”\nThe man paused and looked at Bero as if he was seriously asking himself\nthe same question. Then he grimaced as if he didn’t like his own answer.\n“You made me a shitload of money and never got caught even though most\nof the others got caught, and then somehow, by some dumb kind of miracle I\ncan’t even fathom, you killed Kaul Lan and show up with nothing but a\nbandage on your arm. I don’t know what it is with you, keke, but you got\nsome strange luck of the gods on you, and I’m not messing with that. No\nway.” He pointed at the set of stairs leading underground. “Don’t touch a\nthing down there. Now get—before I change my mind.”\nBero couldn’t believe this was happening. He’d done everything right,\ntaken every opportunity presented to him, been daring where others had been\nmeek—and this was what he got for it? Earlier, he’d felt near invincible,\nconvinced his rewards were finally coming to him. Now he saw that it was\nnothing more than a horrible joke. He thought about refusing to leave. He’d\nwait right here in the back of the Goody Too until that goateed Green Bone\nbastard showed up and then he’d demand his due.\nMudt was right, though. There was some strange luck on him and it was\nbest not to question it. Just as it had told him to chase after Kaul last night, it\ntold him now that if he stayed, he wouldn’t live long enough for his fortune\nto turn again.\nHe started down the tunnel. “It’s dark down there,” he protested.

Mudt\nhanded him a flashlight and he switched it on. When he got to the last of the\nsteps, Mudt slammed the trapdoor shut and Bero jumped. He heard Mudt\nrolling the filing cabinet back into place overhead and a sudden sick panic\ngripped him by the throat. What if this wasn’t an escape route after all, but a\ntrick? What if Mudt had trapped him down here, to hand over to either one of\nthe clans later, or simply to die?\nBero swung the flashlight around. The beam shook with his fear, dancing\nover unlabeled crates and boxes. This must be where Mudt kept his most\nvaluable contraband. Under other circumstances, Bero would’ve been eager\nto open them up and take a look, but when the yellow circle of his flashlight\npassed over the nearby items and disappeared down a long, beckoning tunnel,\nrelief opened into Bero’s veins and he hurried toward it, away from the hated\nsting of being wronged yet again.\nCHAPTER\n36\nLet the Gods Recognize Him\nA\nt least, Hilo thought, it was not raining.\nLan’s funeral procession wound its long, slow way through the streets to\nthe family’s ancestral burial grounds on a hillside cemetery in Widow’s Park,\nnot far from Kaul Dushuron Academy. There was no threat of violence—it\nwould be unthinkable bad luck to interrupt a Green Bone’s final death parade\n—but the tension was palpable, hanging as low over the ceremony as the\nthick late autumn clouds. Four days of illusory calm had descended over\nJanloon while the clans buried their dead. No Peak had returned the bodies of\nthe Green Bones slain in the betting houses so the Mountain could hold rites\nfor them. In the No Peak parts of the city, ceremonial spirit guiding lamps\nhad gone up in the windows of homes and businesses to honor Kaul Lan,\ngrandson of the Torch, Pillar of the clan—let the gods recognize him.\nHilo had been walking directly behind the hearse for hours. Shae and\nMaik Kehn, the newly appointed Horn, walked side by side behind him. After\nthem came the heads of the other prominent families in the clan—all of them\nFists, Luckbringers, or Lantern Men—and behind them, a long trailing crowd\nof other clan loyalists who’d joined the march to pay their respects. Wen was\nback there somewhere with Tar. Hilo would have liked to have her up here\nwith him, but they were not yet married; the nuptials had been indefinitely\npostponed. Instead of planning his wedding, he was walking in his brother’s\nfuneral.\nIt was customary for family members to hold two days and nights of silent\nvigil over the white cloth-draped coffin before the funeral, and Hilo had slept\nno more than four hours a stretch in the days before that, so his exhaustion\nhad taken on a kind of hellish quality. Every few minutes, the funeral gongs\nand drums would raise an awful din from the front of the hearse, calling\ndown the attention of the gods to observe Lan’s passage into the spirit world,\nand jolting Hilo to continue putting one foot in front of the other.

It was said\nthat one must not speak or sleep during the vigil because if the spirit of the\ndeceased had any final messages to pass on, it would do so during that time.\nIf nothing happened, that meant the loved one had moved on from the earthly\nrealm and was at peace.\nThat was further evidence, in Hilo’s opinion, that spiritual sayings were\nfull of shit. Lan’s ghost, if it was out there, was not at peace, and Hilo was\ncertain it would have things to say to him if it could. You’re no Pillar, it\nwould say. I was born for it, trained for it, and look at how it killed me. You\nthink you can do any better? Grandda always said you were good for nothing\nbut thuggery.\n“Shut up,” Hilo murmured, though he knew it wasn’t really Lan he was\nspeaking to, only his own fears speaking in his brother’s voice. Last night, in\na moment of sleep-deprived, superstitious weakness, he’d laid his hands on\nthe hilt of Lan’s moon blade and strained his Perception out so far that\ndozens of auras and hundreds of heartbeats chorused in his mind like white\nnoise. He hadn’t felt the barest hint of Lan’s presence. No spirit had appeared\nor spoken to him during the vigil, not even to say, Don’t worry, brother,\nyou’ll be joining me soon enough.\nThey reached the cemetery at last. The hearse climbed slowly up to the\nburial ground where a new plot had been dug next to the green marble family\nmonument where Hilo’s father and other forebears were buried. Three Deitist\npenitents wearing white funerary robes were waiting to perform the final\nrituals. Hilo’s mother was standing by Kaul Sen, who sat in a wheelchair by\nthe gravesite, Kyanla holding a shade over him even though it was overcast.\nThey had been driven here ahead of the procession. Kaul Wan Ria, fetched\nfrom the cottage in Marenia, had the bent posture of someone who had long\nago stopped questioning or fighting the world; her grieving eyes were as dull\nas those of an old doll. The patriarch was motionless, his gnarled hands\ngripping the arms of the chair like tree roots sunken into clay.\nHilo embraced his mother, though she returned the gesture with limp arms\nand barely seemed to see him. Lan had been the most dutiful of her children,\nmore than her other two put together. “I love you, Ma,” Hilo said. She didn’t\nreply. The gray in her hair stood out more starkly than ever, and she looked\nlumpy in shapeless white funeral clothes. Out of the entire family, the shock\nwas perhaps greatest for her. Hilo doubted Lan had conveyed much to their\nmother about the situation between the clans in the city. Complicit in her\nignorance, she was now enduring the greater part of pain, and Hilo was\nforced to make a mental note to himself that she ought to be moved closer to\nthe family, or help hired in Marenia to better care for her.\nHe went next to his grandfather and knelt respectfully, clasping his hands"

As he leaned over, he half expected his\ngrandfather to shoot out a clawlike hand and crush his windpipe in front of all\nthe onlookers. Kaul Sen’s fingers twitched, but he merely glowered at his\nremaining grandson with vague disdain. Hilo moved aside, letting Shae step\nin to stand beside the chair and take their grandfather’s hand. “Where’s\nDoru?” he heard the old man grumble to her.\nHilo had been worried about his grandfather being here. Kaul Sen was\neven more unpredictable now. What might he say? Would he loudly\ndenounce Hilo in public, or start ranting about how wonderful his son Du had\nbeen? Now, though, Hilo relaxed a little. It was good that Grandda was here;\nin the wheelchair he looked frail and confused. Clearly, just a broken old man\n—no longer the Torch of Kekon. There were those in the clan, Hilo knew, the\nold guard, who might’ve agitated for Kaul Sen to step back into the clan’s\nleadership position. Now they would see that it wasn’t possible.\nHilo took up a spot next to the coffin. As the other members of the clan\narrived, he observed whether they came first to him to pay their respect to the\nnew Pillar, or whether they went to offer whispered condolences to Kaul Sen.\nMost came to him, as custom dictated. Some did not. Enough for Hilo to\nknow his position as Pillar was far from universally accepted.\nHe kissed Wen chastely on the cheeks when she came up with Tar. She\nwas lovely even in the white face powder that signified mourning and washed\nout the normal glow of her complexion. She slid her hand into his briefly as\nhis lips touched her face. “Don’t mind those old men,” she whispered, as if\nreading his mind, or more simply, noticing how he glanced at the cluster of\nguests who had not yet come and addressed him as Pillar. “They haven’t\naccepted reality yet.”\n“Some of them are powerful,” Hilo replied quietly. “Some are\ncouncilmen.”\n“Councilmen are useless in a war,” Wen said. “The Lantern Men don’t\nneed regulations or tax breaks right now; they need protection. They need the\nclan’s strength. Look at all the Fists here, how they rally to you. Everyone\nelse in the clan sees that too.” She squeezed his fingers, then went to stand by\nher brothers.\nHilo scanned the crowd until he spotted Anden standing off to the side.\nHe caught his cousin’s eye and motioned for him to join the rest of the\nfamily. Anden hesitated, then walked over. He looked wracked with grief, the\npoor kid, his eyes rimmed and his face almost as drawn and pale as Lan’s\ndrowned corpse when Hilo had first laid eyes on it.\nHilo said gently, “What are you doing alone over there, Andy? You\nbelong over here with us.” Anden’s face twitched like it was being barely"

You\nbelong over here with us.” Anden’s face twitched like it was being barely\nheld together, but he nodded mutely and took up his place next to Shae.\nThe gongs and drums sustained a final crash of noise that made Hilo’s\nhead hurt, and then fell silent, as did the crowd. The senior penitent, a\nLearned One, glided forward and began to lead the long, low chanting\nrecitations that would usher Lan’s spirit to the afterlife, where it would reside\npeacefully until the long-awaited Return, when all of humanity would be\nadmitted back into the fold of Heaven to reclaim their lost kinship with the\ngods.\nHilo tuned out after a few minutes. He moved his lips to echo the chants\nin all the appropriate places, but he had never had faith in things he could not\nsee or feel with his own formidable senses. Deitism, indeed all religion, made\na complicated story out of truths that were simple but hard for people to\naccept.\nJade was a mysterious but natural substance, not a divine gift or the\nremnants of some heavenly palace. The Kekonese were genetically fortunate,\nlike the first monkeys with opposable thumbs, but that was all; people\nweren’t descended from the gods, and they wouldn’t return to being gods.\nPeople were people. The power of jade didn’t make them better or closer to\ngodliness; it just made them more powerful.\nHilo studied the somber crowd. It was populated with influential Lantern\nMen—business owners, corporate executives, judges, politicians. They were\nhere with white envelopes of special tribute money to defray the cost of Lan’s\nfuneral and to publicly proclaim their continued allegiance to the clan. At this\npoint it was a gesture, not a promise. The true strength of their commitment\nwould be revealed over the coming weeks and months. It depended on what\nhappened next, on which way the clan war turned.\nHilo glanced left and right, at his family arrayed around him at the front of\nthe gathered mourners. Today he was putting on a display for the clan—Shae\nas Weather Man, the fearsome Maik brothers as Horn and First Fist, his\nfiancée, and his talented teenage cousin, all standing together. A confident\npublic declaration that the younger generation of No Peak was still strong,\nthat it would ensure the clan had a future. He hoped that, for now, it would be\nenough.\nThe sermon ended with several more murmured refrains of let the gods\nrecognize him and then everyone faced the coffin and watched as it was\nlowered into the earth. Hilo would have to stand and accept the condolences\nof lingering well-wishers for some time. He wished he could lie down on the\nground and pass out instead. Shae, who’d kept vigil with him, stood erect,\nstaring ahead, one hand supporting their mother’s arm. Kaul Sen looked\nslumped and lost in his chair. People began to mingle and converse in hushed\ntones. It was all extremely depressing.\n“Here comes Chancellor Son,” Shae whispered at him.\nThe ruddy, overweight politician approached and placed his white\nenvelope tactfully in the collection dish by the grave. “Kaul-jen,” he said\ngravely, turning and raising his hands in a salute but not, Hilo noticed,"

He was a\nreasonable and wise leader who always thought of the needs of the country\nand never forgot a friendship shown to the clan. I never had anything less\nthan the greatest respect for Kaul Lan. He will be greatly missed.”\n“He will,” Hilo agreed, making the effort to keep his face neutral, for it\ncould not be clearer that the chancellor was pressing a message upon him and\nwas already, with his shrewd gaze, making unfavorable comparisons between\nthe old Pillar and the new. Son conveyed himself with the smooth words of a\ndiplomat, but Hilo didn’t need Perception to sense that the man’s wariness\nand ambivalence emanated all down the line of Lantern Men here today.\nThey relied on the clan for protection and patronage, and when they looked at\nHilo, they saw his obvious youth and violent reputation.\nAfter today, Shae would tally the monetary contributions and then he’d\nhave a better idea of where he stood, how much he needed to worry. As much\nas he wanted to take comfort in what Wen had said, Hilo knew that it didn’t\nmatter how many loyal Fists he had; if he lost the support of the Lantern\nMen, if they began to defect to the Mountain, then he would lose the clan. He\nturned, with reluctance, to politely greet the next one who followed on Son’s\nheels to deposit his envelope and pay respect.\nWhen at last the line of guests had finally thinned and the crowd began to\ndisperse, Anden came up. “Hilo-jen,” he said tentatively, “I have to talk to\nyou.” The teen’s face was contorted, as if he were in physical pain. When he\nspoke, his words were rushed, his expression that of a man pleading\nforgiveness for some terrible crime. “There’s something I didn’t tell you\nwhen I should have. If only—if only I’d—”\nHilo drew his distressed cousin aside. “What is it, Andy?”\n“Lan had me run errands for him before he died. He had me go to this\nplace and pick up packages and bring them to him without telling anyone.”\nAnden’s agonized whisper was wound as tight as a wire. “Lan was acting\nstrange when I saw him last. Angry, not like himself, and his aura was\ndifferent, too sharp. The packages—they were vials, Hilo. Vials of—”\nHilo seized the lapel of Anden’s suit and pulled him forward. He gave a\nsingle, sharp shake of his head. “Don’t say it.” His voice was low and angry.\nAnden fell silent and stared at him, frozen.\nHilo’s expression was chiseled from stone. He leaned in and spoke near\nAnden’s ear. “Lan was the first of this family, the Pillar of our clan. The\nMountain killed him, and I’m going to make sure they pay for it. And no"

Ever.” His grip on Anden’s lapel\ntightened as he drew back enough to lock gazes. “What you just said to me\nnow—have you said it to anyone else, at school?”\n“No,” Anden said, eyes wide. “No one.”\n“Don’t ever mention it again.”\nAnden throat moved but no sound emerged. He nodded.\nHilo’s fingers loosened and his fierce expression melted. He straightened\nout the front of Anden’s suit jacket and put his hands on the teen’s shoulders.\n“It eats at me too, Andy—what else I could’ve done. I should’ve paid more\nattention. I should’ve had guards following him that night. It doesn’t matter\nnow; what happened has happened, and we can’t change it. It wasn’t your\nfault, not in the slightest.”\nAnden did not look at him; he swiped his eyes with the back of his hand.\nHilo hated seeing him riddled with sorrow and guilt like this. He asked softly,\n“Do you need some time off? Do you want me to talk to the Academy?”\nAnden shook his head at once. “No, I want to graduate on time.”\n“That’s good. Lan would’ve wanted that.” Hilo tried to give his cousin a\ncomforting smile, but Anden still wouldn’t look up. The teen nodded and\npulled away, retreating toward some Academy classmates standing with their\nfamilies a short distance away. Hilo let out a tired breath as he watched his\ncousin go. He hadn’t meant to speak so harshly, but Anden would be taking\noaths soon, coming into the clan at a time of war—it was important that he\nunderstand. In a Green Bone clan, legacy was crucial. Lan’s authority had\nrested on the legacy of his grandfather and father, and Hilo’s would rest also\non his brother’s. The clan was like a body: The Lantern Men were skin and\nmuscles, the Fists and Luckbringers like heart and lungs, but the Pillar was\nthe spine. There could be no weakness in the spine, or the body could not\nstand, it could not fight. Lan had been ambushed by their enemies and had\nfallen as a warrior—there must never be any doubt of that.\nHilo said to Tar, “Get the rest of these people out of here. I want to be\nalone.”\nTar and Kehn ushered the remaining guests gently but firmly back down\nto the cemetery gates. Shae bowed her head for a long moment. Her lips\nmoved as if she was saying something silently to Lan’s coffin. Then she\nturned and walked away, guiding their mother’s slow steps. Wen came up to\nHilo and put a questioning hand on his arm. “Go with your brothers,” he told\nher. “I’ll follow.” She did as he asked.\nKaul Sen remained by the open grave with Kyanla standing patiently\nbehind his wheelchair. “He was a good boy,” the old man said finally. “A\ngood son.”"

He cried with the silent, ugly face of\nsomeone who was embarrassed to do so, who thought tears were for the\nfeeble. Kyanla tried to comfort him, handing him tissues from her purse. “Ah\nthere, there, Kaul-jen, it’s okay to cry. We’re all human, we all need to cry to\nfeel better, even the Pillar.” Kaul Sen took no notice of her.\nHilo looked away. Seeing the old man weep made his chest heavy, as\nheavy as lead. His grandfather was an insufferable tyrant, but his life had\nbeen more tragic than anyone deserved. All his military and civic\nachievements, public accolades, and decades of rule over the family and the\nclan could not compensate for the fact that he’d buried his only son, and now\nhis eldest grandson.\nWhen his grandfather had broken down in dementia and been sedated\ndays ago, Hilo had instructed Dr. Truw to remove and lock away some of the\nold man’s jade. A few stones from his belt to start. The doctor said it would\nhelp; it would make Grandda less likely to hurt himself or others, it would\ndull his senses, slow his metabolism, make him calmer. When he awoke,\nKaul Sen did not seem to even notice his missing jade—a sad sign in itself—\nbut Hilo did. The Torch’s once indomitable aura was already a shadow of\nwhat it used to be; loss of jade only made that more apparent. Seeing him like\nthis now, Hilo knew with abrupt certainty that his grandfather did not have\nlong to live. There would be another Kaul family funeral soon—though he\nwasn’t going to wager on whose it would be.\nHilo knew he was the least loved of all his grandfather’s progeny, but he\nmade himself go to Kaul Sen’s side. “It’s all right, Grandda,” he said quietly.\n“You made the clan stronger than any one of us.” He crouched next to the\nwheelchair. “Don’t worry, I’m going to take care of things. I’m not Du or\nLan, but I’m still a Kaul. I’ll make things right, I promise.”\nHe didn’t know if his grandfather heard him or cared, but the old man\nstopped weeping and dropped his chin to his chest, closing his eyes. Hilo had\nKyanla push him back to the car.\nHilo stood alone by Lan’s grave at last. And even though he didn’t believe\nin Heaven or ghosts, there were things that needed to be said.\n“Your jade, brother. I had it sewn under the lining of the coffin. No one\ntook it from you, and no one else will ever wear it. It’s yours.” He was silent\nfor a minute. “I know you don’t think I can do this, but you didn’t leave me\nany choice, did you? So I’m going to prove you wrong. I won’t let it happen;\nI won’t let No Peak fall. If there is an afterlife, when you see me again, you\ntell me if I kept the oaths I made to you.”\nCHAPTER\n37\nThe Weather Man’s Pardon"

If there is an afterlife, when you see me again, you\ntell me if I kept the oaths I made to you.”\nCHAPTER\n37\nThe Weather Man’s Pardon\nS\nhae went to the Weather Man’s house, where two men kept Yun Dorupon\nunder constant guard. The two men were junior Fingers who would be no\nmatch for a senior Green Bone, but they did not need to be, not when their\ncaptive no longer possessed any jade. One man stayed by the front door to\nkeep people away, and one stayed inside to keep Doru from getting out. They\ncarried handguns only, not even their talon knives, so their prisoner had no\nchance of getting his hands on a jade-hilted weapon.\nWhen Shae approached, the sentry said, “Hilo-jen said no one’s to go in.”\nEven these junior Fingers referred to Hilo in the familiar, as if they were his\npersonal friends.\n“This is the Weather Man’s house,” Shae said. “I’m the Weather Man, so\nthis is my residence. The man in there is a temporary guest, and I intend to\nspeak to him.” When the Finger still hesitated, Shae said, “It’d be better if\nyou were to simply report me to my brother rather than get in my way.”\nThe Finger considered his position relative to hers and let her in. The\ninside of the house was dark even in the middle of the morning. All the blinds\nwere shut, and the ceiling fan circulated warm, stuffy air that smelled of\ncloves and musty sweaters. Doru did not throw anything away; the house was\nfilled with uncoordinated furniture, houseplants, and all manner of random\ngifts accumulated from decades as Weather Man—statuettes and little ornate\nboxes, colorful vases and carved paperweights, throw rugs and ebony\ncoasters. In one corner of the living room, by the window, the other guard sat\nin a chair, looking bored. Doru was lying stretched out lengthwise on the\nsofa, a wet, folded towel over his eyes. “Is that you, Shae-se?”\n“Doru-je—” Shae caught herself. “Hello, Uncle Doru.” The former\nWeather Man was no longer entitled to the suffix he’d held most of his life.\nDoru lifted the towel from his eyes and shifted his lanky limbs, sitting up\nslowly and gingerly, as if he was unfamiliar with his body and suspicious it\nmight break. Without his jade, he looked gaunt and creaky. The former\nWeather Man licked dry, thin lips and squinted at Shae, as if making sure it\nwas her. “Ah,” he breathed, leaning his head back and closing his eyes as if\nalready exhausted merely from moving. “How did you manage, Shae-se?\nGoing through this by yourself, so far from home?”\nShe had been young and healthy, better able to endure the headaches,\ncrushing fatigue, and panic attacks of jade withdrawal. Doru was nearly as\nelderly as her grandfather. She couldn’t help wondering if a quick death\nwouldn’t have been a kinder fate for him than this humiliating ordeal. “It gets\neasier, after the first two weeks,” she told him.\n“I know, Shae-se.” Doru sighed. “This isn’t the first time I’ve been jade-"

At least this time I’m in the comfort of my home\ninstead of a Shotarian torture cell.” He moved his fingers in a no matter\ngesture. “I don’t expect it to last as long, though. Come closer; I can’t hear\nyou that well anymore. Sit down and do tell me why I’m still alive.”\nShae picked her way over to the armchair and sat down across from the\nman. “Lan’s funeral, Uncle,” she said. “It was yesterday.”\nWater gathered under Doru’s papery eyelids and slipped out the corners of\nhis eyes, tracing thin tracks down the sides of his face, like estuaries seeking\na route through a landscape of wrinkles. “Why him? He was always such a\ngood, thoughtful man, a dutiful son. Ah, Lan-se, why were you so foolish? So\ngood, and so foolish?” Accusingly, “You could have let me come to the\nfuneral. Hilo could have given me that one courtesy.”\n“You know he couldn’t have.”\n“How did it happen? Poor Lan-se, how did he die?”\n“He was ambushed on his way home from the Lilac Divine. Drowned in\nthe harbor.” Shae was surprised she could say the words.\nDoru shook his head emphatically. “That can’t be. It must have been a\nterrible mistake. That was never the plan, no, never.”\nA chill anger pumped through Shae’s veins. “Why did you betray us,\nDoru? After so many years, why?”\n“I only ever did what I thought was best. What Kaul-jen himself would\nwant. I would never betray him, for anything or anyone.” His face sagged\nwith regret. “Not even his own grandchildren.”\n“You’re not making any sense. Are you saying Grandda wanted you to\nconspire with the Mountain against us?”\n“A good Weather Man,” Doru said, “can read his Pillar like his own mind.\nKaul-jen never had to ask me to do this thing or that, he never had to say,\n‘Doru-jen, what should I do?’ I always knew what aim he was moving\ntoward, even before he saw it clearly himself. If he said, ‘We must capture\nthis town,’ I knew he meant to disrupt the shipping lines. If he said, ‘We\nshould talk to so-and-so,’ I knew he meant to buy them out, and I should\nbegin to make the preparations. I saw and did the things Kaul-jen did not ask.\nDo you understand, Shae-se?”\n“No,” she said.\n“Kaul-jen only ever made a few mistakes in his life that he regretted.\nWhen he and Ayt were partners, the One Mountain Society was strong—\nstrong enough to liberate a nation! You were born after the end of the war,\nShae-se; you cannot appreciate or understand what that means. It was peace,\nnot war, that divided us into clans, turned us into rivals for territory and\nbusiness and jade. Your grandfather, I can tell he is heartbroken that he and\nAyt would leave such a legacy of strife. I tried to fix what he wished he could"

I tried to bring the clans together again.”\n“By covering for the Mountain while they mined jade behind our backs?\nBy colluding with their Weather Man to sell us out? I examined the KJA and\nTreasury records. You were lining your own pockets.”\n“What do I need more money for, at my age?” His long face wrinkled in\ndisdain. “Ayt’s daughter means to combine the clans. She will do it\npeacefully, or she will do it by force. She is a stronger, more ambitious, more\ncunning Pillar than Lan ever was—Heaven forgive me for saying so. Many\ntimes, I tried to convince him to negotiate for a merger, but he refused to\nconsider it. He had pride riding on one shoulder and the voice of that wolf\nHilo on the other.”\nDoru’s voice was fading, as if his energy was leaving him. “I agreed to\nobscure the Mountain’s mining activities in exchange for money—money I\nput back into the clan. I strengthened our position in businesses where we’re\nstrong—real estate, construction, hospitality—and began to divest out of\nareas where the Mountain held the advantage—gambling, manufacturing,\nretail, and so on. They would grow wealthier and more powerful, but we\nwould be stronger as well, a better fit, two pieces of a broken puzzle—Lan\nwould see reason and realize a merger was the only peaceful, sensible\nsolution.”\nShae closed her eyes for a long moment. “Did you know they would try to\nkill Hilo? That they would murder Lan?”\nDoru’s head moved back and forth on the sofa cushions. “Not Lan, no—\nlet the gods recognize him. Hilo, I could do nothing about him. He was\nworking at cross-purposes, stealing back the businesses I surrendered to the\nMountain, stalking the borders and escalating fights. Fists are like sharks, you\nknow, it takes only a little blood in the water to stir them to a frenzy. The\nfeud on the streets grew like fire; the Mountain became impatient. I knew\nthey would decide Hilo had to die. I knew this, but I said and did nothing. So\nit doesn’t trouble me that it’s Hilo who will put me to death soon.”\nWhen Shae looked at Doru, at the mottled, vellum-like skin of his hands\nand neck, she thought of her friend Paya, who she hadn’t spoken to in years.\nIt wasn’t Paya’s love of music, her skill with numbers, or her talent in\nLightness that Shae remembered. It was the shock of a dozen filthy\nphotographs spilling from a manila envelope that wormed into her mind.\nShae could not bring herself to speculate on what else she’d find if she\nsearched this cluttered house. Doru had been a presence in the Kaul family\nfor all of Shae’s life, he’d been like an uncle to the Torch’s grandchildren, but\nhe’d abused his position as Weather Man in so many ways even before he’d\nbegun secretly undermining Lan.

A Weather Man doesn’t go against the Pillar. He has to die; there’s\nnothing to be done about it.”\nExcept that Hilo had not yet given the order to have Doru executed. He\nmight be merciless to enemies, but Hilo was softhearted within the family.\nShae suspected he was putting it off, not eager for it to be one of his first acts\nas Pillar. With Lan’s funeral behind them, however, it would be soon.\nPerhaps even today or tomorrow.\nShae made up her mind. She gathered the words she’d wanted to spit for\nsome time and shifted forward to the edge of the chair. “You disgust me,\nUncle Doru. I don’t need to tell you why. In my opinion, you’ve lived too\nlong already, protected by Grandda’s friendship no matter what you did. I\nwouldn’t shed a tear for you myself, but I’ll keep you from execution, if\nyou’ll help Grandda.” Her words thickened, and she paused. “All he does is\nsit in his room. He was so frail at the funeral, and he’s barely spoken since\nthen. When he does speak, he asks for you.”\nDoru’s head had rolled back against the sofa, but he was listening. She\ncould see his eyes moving under his thin eyelids, and his throat bobbed as he\nswallowed.\n“His mind is going,” Shae said. “The doctor says he needs familiar people\nand routines. If you would play chess and have tea with him in the mornings,\nlike you always used to, I know it would be of comfort to him. If you swear\nto take no further part in the clan business, I’ll talk to Hilo. I’ll convince him\nto let you keep your life, if you’ll agree to help Grandda now, near the end,\nwhen he needs you.”\nShe suspected she would have to fight Hilo hard for this, and so early on\nin their partnership, no less. But she was willing to do it. She was losing her\ngrandfather, so soon after losing Lan. To all the solicitous clan members\nwho’d crowded up to acknowledge Hilo as Pillar at the funeral yesterday, it\nhad been obvious that Kaul Sen’s will to live was fading fast, even faster than\nhis jade aura as he was slowly weaned off the stones he’d won and worn over\nthe decades.\nIt was heartbreaking irony that she’d spent the last few good years of her\ngrandfather’s life in a faraway country, and all she would get from now on\nwere fleeting occasions of lucidity that came and went like flashes of tropical\nrain. He’d loved her most of all his grandchildren and wanted so badly for her\nto return to the clan, but now that she had, he didn’t even know it. She could\naccept that, but she wasn’t ready to let him go, to watch his body wither into\na shell and his mind blow away like dust. “I want what’s best for Grandda,”\nshe said to Doru. “That’s even more important than clan justice. Do you\nagree, Uncle?”\nDoru lifted his head from the sofa. His skull swayed as if it was too heavy"

The man’s eyes were sunken but still shiny and dark as marbles.\n“I will always do what Kaul-jen needs of me.”\n“We’ll tell Grandda you’ve had health problems—early symptoms of the\nItches. That’s why you’re without jade. There’ll be a guard present, and\nyou’re forbidden to speak of any clan business. That’s the only way this can\nhappen, and if you break the rules, I won’t protect you from Hilo a second\ntime.”\n“I can’t swear on my jade any longer,” Doru said with bitter humor, “but\nyou have my word. I know my position, Shae-se. I did my best to steer\ntoward a better outcome for us all, but I failed. Lan is dead, and Hilo is Pillar.\nI live only on his mercy, and yours I see, and if I can be of simple company\nto Kaul-jen for the short time we both have left, that is more than enough.\nYou’ve nothing to worry about from me.”\nShae nodded and stood up. It seemed inappropriate to thank him when she\nwas the one promising to spare his life, and also inappropriate to apologize\nfor his situation, so she merely said, “Good, then.”\nDoru laid his thin, fragile body back down on the sofa. “I get tired so\neasily now. I can’t tell if it’s this old jadeless body or the ache in my heart.”\nHe pressed the damp towel back over his eyes and went still, though his voice\nstill rasped. “You may hate me for my weaknesses, as I know you do, but I\ncould never wish any ill on you, Shae-se, and I never will. The only thing that\nmakes me glad for my fate is seeing you—so strong, so clever and beautiful,\nwith your jade on. It took murder and war to bring you back, but do you\nremember? I always said to your grandfather that someday you would replace\nme as Weather Man.”\nCHAPTER\n38\nThe Lantern Man’s Dilemma\nT\nhe Twice Lucky had been doing excellent business for months, and as it\nwas located near a freeway entrance not far from a territorial border, Mr. Une\nwas alarmed but not entirely surprised when two heavily armed Green Bones\nfrom the No Peak clan showed up in the morning and sat at the closed bar,\nplaying cards on the countertop and watching the front door. The restaurateur\nwent to see if he could offer them anything to eat or drink. “Are you\nexpecting trouble, jen?” he asked.\n“Maybe,” said one of the Green Bones, a man with a short beard, whose\nname was Satto. The other was a much younger man named Caun. “The Horn\nthinks there will be. We need a phone, to call him if there is.” It took Mr. Une\na moment to remember that the men were no longer referring to Kaul Hilo,\nbut to Maik Kehn.\nMr. Une brought out the phone from his office and plugged it in behind\nthe bar. “Should I close for the day?” he asked, growing more nervous by the\nminute."

No need right now.”\nThere was, indeed, barely any need, as business was very slow. Normally,\nlunch hour on a Fifthday was packed, but yesterday had been the funeral\nprocession of the murdered Pillar, Kaul Lan, let the gods recognize him.\nEveryone expected that today the clans would be back at war with a\nvengeance, and Janlooners were wisely deciding to stay home whenever\npossible. Mr. Une had heard that some businesses in disputed neighborhoods\nhad reduced their hours, or like the Dancing Girl in the Armpit, closed for the\nday altogether. Mr. Une’s father, however, had kept the Twice Lucky open\nalmost every day, even during the Many Nations War when both Shotarian\nsoldiers and Espenian bombs threatened to shut it down permanently, so the\nrestaurateur was on principle disinclined to let any threat disrupt business.\nHe began to reevaluate his stance shortly after midday, when a phone call\ncame in and the voice on the other end asked to speak to Satto. By this time,\nthe two Green Bones had availed themselves of the lunch buffet and were\nlooking bored. The few other diners in the Twice Lucky had seated\nthemselves far away, and kept glancing at the two men nervously. When\nSatto hung up the phone, he said to Mr. Une, “Tell the customers to leave.\nThe Mountain’s attacked the Docks. They’re on their way here.” Caun was\ntaking the liberty of shutting and latching the wooden blinds.\n“Wh-when will they arrive?” stammered Mr. Une.\nSatto shrugged. “Fifteen minutes perhaps.”\nMr. Une went around personally to all the tables. None of the customers\nobjected; they cleared out of the Twice Lucky at once, some taking their\nunfinished meals in takeout containers, many of them leaving generous tips\non the assumption that Mr. Une would soon be needing the money for\nrepairs. Mr. Une sent the most junior employees away as well. The rest of the\nstaff shut away all the pots and pans, dishes, glasses—anything breakable that\nthey could secure. They waited until all the patrons were out, as was the\nexpectation in these sorts of circumstances, then they went into the break\nroom or kitchen and sat on the floor. Mr. Une remained out front, alternately\npatting his brow with a cloth and wringing his hands. “Is it only the two of\nyou?” he asked. “Not that I doubt either of your abilities, jen, but surely—”\nAt that moment, three other Green Bones from the clan—two men and a\nwoman—came through the door, breathing hard and sweating, as if they’d\nrun here from another location. Mr. Une’s relief at the arrival of\nreinforcements was quickly shattered when the woman panted, “They’ve\ntaken almost everything south of the General’s Ride. Gont’s leading the\nattack himself.” The moon blade in her hand was wet.

He dove\nbehind the bar just as the sound of squealing tires, slamming doors, and\ngunfire erupted in front of the restaurant.\nThe initial spray of bullets peppered the entrance facade and broke three\nof the Twice Lucky’s front windows—Mr. Une groaned thinking about the\ndamage—but after that the gunfire ceased. In a contest for territory, it was to\nno one’s advantage—either the attacking or defending clan—to badly ruin\npotential tribute property or kill bystanders. There was shouting outside,\nsounds of steel on steel, a scream of pain, the screech of another car arriving\nand additional muffled noises of fighting. Mr. Une thought he might have\nheard someone yelling, “Fall back!” but it was obscured by two more\ngunshots.\nAfter that, there was silence. Mr. Une didn’t dare to breathe.\nJust when he’d mustered the courage to stand up to try to see what was\nhappening, the front doors burst open and a huge Green Bone who could only\nbe Gont Asch, Horn of the Mountain, strode in. Three of his warriors\nfollowed close behind, their eyes bright and wild, their faces and clothes\nspeckled with blood. Gont stood in the foyer, surveying the empty dining\nroom floor. “A very nice place,” he said. He turned his head toward the bar.\nMr. Une had ducked back down and was stifling whimpers with his sleeve.\n“Come out, my friend,” Gont called.\nHesitantly, Mr. Une stood up. Gont motioned him forward. Swallowing,\nthe restaurant owner forced himself to put on his most professional, solicitous\nmanner and approach the posse of men. As he neared them, he glanced\ntoward the front door and was horrified to see blood on the glass and the\nlower half of Caun’s body lying in his field of view. He jumped like a\nsquirrel when Gont said, “Where is your staff?”\nMr. Une tried to speak but found it difficult, so he pointed toward the\nkitchen and back room. “Bring them out,” Gont said to one of his men. Mr.\nUne gave another start when the front door opened and two other Mountain\nGreen Bones entered, dragging a mostly limp Satto between them. They\ndeposited him in front of Gont like cats offering up a slain rat. “Jade for our\nHorn,” said one of the Mountain warriors, saluting Gont. “A worthy victory,\nthis. The Twice Lucky is one of No Peak’s jewels.”\nSatto struggled to his knees and spat on Gont’s shoes. “My blood for my\nclan. Hilo-jen will tear the jade from your cold, dead—”\nGont brought his moon blade down with such swiftness and force that Mr.\nUne did not have time to let out a sound before Satto’s head rolled across the\ncarpet and came to a stop at the foot of the hostess podium. “All of you"

He eyed the board with the day’s specials written in\nchalk. “Is the lunch buffet still open?” he asked.\nThe question snapped Mr. Une out of his shock. “Y-yes, Gont-jen.\nThough it’s been put away and might not be as hot and fresh as it would be if\nyou’d come two hours ago …” He trailed off in awareness of how ridiculous\nthat sounded.\n“I am told that this is a favorite dinner spot of my enemy Kaul Hilo,”\nGont said. “And that the crispy squid served here is particularly excellent.\nRegretfully, I have never had the opportunity to dine here. Such is the\nunfortunate reality of being a Green Bone in this city.” Two of his men\npassed by, carrying Satto’s headless body.\n“I’m flattered that the Twice Lucky’s reputation has reached you, jen,”\nMr. Une said hastily, sweating profusely. “Please, allow me to bring you a\nplate of crispy squid so that you can finally taste it for yourself.”\n“I would like nothing more,” Gont said. “Also, bring me your ledgers.”\nMr. Une hurried to do both. Ten minutes later, the Horn of the Mountain\nput a piece of squid into his mouth and chewed. His subordinates watched\ncuriously. The remaining staff of the Twice Lucky had been collected from\nthe back and gathered around as well. They stood in a silent, fearful\nsemicircle behind Mr. Une. Gont’s heavy brow furrowed; he swallowed, then\nraised a hand and smacked the table several times in applause. “Truly, the\nreputation of the Twice Lucky is well deserved,” he said. “The crunchiness is\nperfect, the flavoring is so unique … and there is just the right amount of\nspiciness. I would gladly eat this every day.” Despite himself, Mr. Une\nbeamed at the praise. Behind him, the kitchen staff let out sighs of relief.\nGont continued eating as he turned to the black ledger book Mr. Une had\nset before him and opened it. “How much tribute do you pay to No Peak?” he\nasked.\nMr. Une told him, and Gont nodded slowly as he examined the books.\n“Your business has been doing better than that lately, and we’re in a time of\nwar. You’ll pay one and half times that amount to the Mountain clan.” He\ngestured to his Fists to take chopsticks and help themselves to the squid as\nwell, which they eagerly did. “Now, my friend, swear your allegiance and\ntribute, and you’ll be open as usual tomorrow.”\nMr. Une’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times before he mopped\nhis brow and said, “Gont-jen, I’ve been a Lantern Man in No Peak for more\nthan twenty years.

My brother and my nephew are also Lantern Men loyal to\nthe Kauls, my sister-in-law is a Luckbringer, my cousin is a Finger in the\nclan. Would you not allow me to leave here honorably?” It was a well-\nengrained custom that if one clan took over another’s territory, jadeless\nbusiness owners and workers would be allowed to switch allegiance or leave\nwithout consequence; that’s what had happened at the betting houses on Poor\nMan’s Road that the Kauls had conquered just a few days ago.\n“That would not be acceptable in this case,” Gont said. “The Une family\nhas run the Twice Lucky for as long as it’s existed. It would be a travesty for\nit to continue without your able management and culinary vision at the\nhelm.”\nAgain, Mr. Une found himself flattered. The Horn of the Mountain had a\nrumbling, well-enunciated baritone voice that made him seem most\nreasonable. Perhaps it would not be so bad to be a Lantern Man in the\nMountain; how different would it be, really, paying tribute to one clan versus\nanother? Yet, never in all his years had Mr. Une seriously contemplated the\nTwice Lucky being taken by another clan. No Peak had always been so\npowerful here, Kaul Hilo’s patronage so ironclad. The war might yet turn\nagain and the restaurant revert to No Peak. It was safer not to betray anyone.\n“Please, Gont-jen,” Mr. Une said, clasping his hands together and saluting\nrepeatedly, “the Twice Lucky is my family’s legacy, but I must refuse.”\nGont considered this. He wiped his mouth with the cloth napkin and\nstood. “Very well. I understand your position.” He turned to his men; two of\nthem had already departed, presumably to push on further into the Docks or\nwage battle elsewhere in the city, but three remained. “See to it that all the\nstaff members are brought out of the building,” he said. “Then burn it to the\nground.”\nMr. Une’s face froze in horror. As Gont’s Green Bones moved to obey,\nthe restaurant owner cried, “No, Gont-jen, I beg you!” The old man stumbled\nto his knees in front of the Horn. “I-I pledge allegiance and tribute to the\nMountain clan.

Being in this room made her skin\ncrawl. It exuded Doru’s presence. Everything from the old brown leather\nchair imprinted with his body shape, to the ivory fountain pen on the desk, to\nthe open bag of betel nuts in the desk drawer reminded Shae that she was in\nthe old man’s domain, one he’d occupied for nearly as long as she’d been\nalive.\nHer stomach was a mess of hard knots. She could not recall ever being\nmore nervous in her life, not even on the first day she’d walked into a large\nclassroom full of Espenians. When she’d knelt before Hilo swearing to be his\nWeather Man, she’d understood intellectually how difficult that would be,\nbut grief and guilt had carried her through the days of the vigil and funeral\nand it was only now that she truly felt with full force the seeming\nimpossibility of what lay before her. Whatever misgivings the clan might\nharbor about Hilo as Pillar, they were surely even more doubtful of her as\nWeather Man. Doru had been an accomplished war veteran and businessman\nwith decades of experience; she was a twenty-seven-year-old woman who’d\nbeen away from Kekon for the prior two years and never held a position of\nhigh authority in the clan. If she couldn’t command respect and begin capably\nrunning the Weather Man’s office immediately, investments would quickly\ngo south and Lantern Men would defect in droves like rats off a sinking ship.\nShe could lose this war for No Peak faster than anything her brother did or\ndid not do.\nShae rarely smoked except on social occasions, but now she lit a cigarette\nto calm her nerves. What she most needed was the public support of the two\nmen Lan had pegged as the logical potential successors to the Weather Man’s\npost: Woon Papidonwa and Hami Tumashon. The clan had to see that these\ncredible men were behind her. Woon would be arriving any minute now.\nShae remained standing by the window and did not turn around even when\nshe Perceived Woon’s aura exiting the elevator, escorted by Maik Tar.\nTar knocked on the office door, then opened it and said formally, “Kaul-\njen, I’ve brought Woon Papi to you like you asked.” Shae felt an approving\ntwinge of gratitude toward her brother’s lieutenant—clearly Hilo had briefed\nhim well. She took her time stubbing out her cigarette and turning around.\n“Thank you, Tar,” she said, and the Fist departed with a salute, closing the\ndoor firmly behind him, leaving Woon standing just inside.\n“Woon-jen,” Shae said, coming around the desk and motioning the former\nPillarman toward the ugly dark green sofa in the sitting area of the office.\nWoon sat without a word. Shae casually filled two glasses of water from a\npitcher on the side table and placed one of them on the coffee table in front of\nWoon. She noticed that his hand shook slightly as he took it. She lowered\nherself into the armchair opposite him."

She lowered\nherself into the armchair opposite him.\n“My brother spoke well of you,” she said. “He trusted you and considered\nyou a good friend, an old friend all the way back to the Academy.”\nWoon didn’t answer, but in that instant Shae saw written plain on his face\nthe depth of sorrow and shame he felt, and also the legitimate fear for his\nown life. Woon had failed Lan. He hadn’t known his Pillar had gone out that\nfateful night, hadn’t been there to protect him personally nor taken the\nprecaution of ensuring that his bodyguards stayed with him. After Maik Tar\nhad ordered Woon to get into the car this morning, the man would’ve spent\nthe next twenty minutes believing that Kaul Hilo had ordered his exile or\nexecution.\nFinding himself in the Weather Man’s office instead of kneeling on the\nside of a forested stretch of road seemed to have confused Woon, but after\ndrinking the glass of water Shae gave him, he recovered enough to look up\nwith a self-loathing hope in his eyes. “I don’t deserve to live, Kaul-jen.”\nShae said gently, “Lan would’ve forgiven you.” She felt, as much from\nthe involuntary pulse of emotion behind the man’s aura as the look on his\nface, the effect her words had on him. She went on in a soft but firm tone, “If\nthe clan is to win this war and avenge Lan, we can’t afford to lose anyone\nneedlessly. Neither Hilo nor I can take Lan’s place, we know that. Together\nwe stand a chance, but you were Lan’s Pillarman. You knew him well, and\nyou know the business and the politics side of the clan better than either of\nus. Failures must have consequences, it’s true, but there are other ways to\natone.”\nWoon’s face was flushed with remorse over his own relief. “What do you\nwant me to do, Kaul-jen?” he asked in a whisper, and Shae knew that she had\nhandled this correctly. Woon now believed she had plucked him from Hilo’s\njustice for some more noble purpose that Lan would have wanted.\n“I know Lan had plans for you to take on more responsibility in the clan,\nperhaps to become his Weather Man after Doru. Hilo has named me to his\nside, but I can’t do it alone. Help me run the Weather Man’s office, as my\nChief of Staff. That’s a term I picked up in Espenia, for a role much like\nPillarman but with more visibility, more decision-making power. Hilo will\nunderstand. Be my right hand, as you were my brother’s. Will you do this,\nWoon-jen?”\nWoon’s eyes brimmed, and he nodded with his face lowered. “Yes. It’s\nwhat Lan-jen would’ve wanted me to do,” he said simply.\n“Good,” Shae said, relieved that this first conversation had gone as\nplanned. “We have a lot to do, but we’ll start tomorrow. Go home today, but\nstart thinking about what steps we’ll need to take to insulate our businesses.\nBefore you go: Who do you think should be made Master Luckbringer?”"

Even if Woon had given\nanother name, it would’ve been good to demonstrate that she was already\nleaning on his counsel. Still, she was glad he had pointed to Hami.\nWhen Woon had left, Shae drained the rest of her water and leaned her\nhead back against the armchair, preparing herself for what she expected\nwould be the more difficult second conversation. The door opened and a\nwoman who looked as young as Anden edged her head inside tentatively.\n“Kaul-jen?” she ventured in a high, girlish voice. “Is there anything you\nneed?”\nThrough the half-open door, Shae could hear the normal chatter of muted\nconversation in the halls and the ringing of telephones. The Financial District\nwas not technically neutral, but the banks and professional services\nheadquartered in the skyscrapers of Ship Street were less susceptible to being\ntaken over and controlled at the point of a blade. Those clan members who\nworked here—lawyers, accountants, and other Luckbringers of similar\nschooling—waged war in an entirely different way from Fists and Fingers, so\nbusiness continued in spite of the violence raging just across the freeway.\n“Yes,” Shae said, eyeing the girl and making a note to herself to move the\nunfortunate creature to a new job, one in which she would not have to dress\nin such a way and remind Shae of her uncle Doru’s predilections. “Call\nfacilities management. I want this entire office cleared out and new furniture\nbrought in. And send in Hami Tumashon when he arrives.”\nShe seated herself at Doru’s expansive desk and was looking through the\npapers in his inbox when Hami knocked and came in, saluting her shallowly.\n“You asked to see me.” The man’s voice was carefully neutral, but his eyes\nwere faintly narrowed with skepticism.\nShae put down the document she was studying. “Come in, Hami-jen,” she\nsaid, gesturing to the chair in front of the desk. When he sat, she offered him\na cigarette, which he declined. Hami was a brusque man in his late thirties.\nHe’d been a respected Fist before a relayball injury gave him a permanent\nlimp and turned his career path toward corporate law. He wore more jade\nthan the average man on Ship Street and there was a certain proud and solid\nquality to his aura.\nHilo had assured Shae that Hami was a clan loyalist who could be trusted,\nthough perhaps her brother’s assessment was a reflection on the fact that in\nrecent years Hami had clashed with Doru and his career had stalled as a\nresult. Shae suspected Hami might have played a key role in helping Hilo\nfind evidence of Doru’s betrayal. She did not, however, delude herself into\nthinking that this meant the man held any desire to answer to a woman a\ndozen years his junior, regardless of whether she was a Kaul.\nShae said straight away, “I’m in a difficult position, and the Pillar has told\nme that you’re the one I need to talk to, because you always speak honestly"

A strange quality for a lawyer, I\nmight add.” She saw Hami’s eyes widen slightly at this. She’d gotten his\nattention. He might be honest, but he also knew how to reserve judgment and\nhe appeared to be doing so now, waiting for her to continue.\nShae settled back in Doru’s padded chair and spoke as if she were\nreluctantly bringing the Luckbringer into her deepest confidence. “Hami-jen,\nI didn’t expect to have to sit in this office for at least another fifteen years. I\nreturned from studying in Espenia not long ago. I was supposed to run some\nof the clan’s companies to get operational experience. Some of the easier,\nstable businesses that still have room to grow—in real estate or tourism,\nperhaps. Along the way, I could live life, travel, maybe meet someone and\nget married. I’m the youngest Kaul, so my grandfather always gave me more\nfreedom.”\n“And now you’re the Weather Man.” It was said matter-of-factly, but the\nupward twitch of Hami’s mouth betrayed that he found this ironic and\namusing.\n“And now I’m the Weather Man.” Shae’s voice hardened and she knew\nHami would Perceive the true resentment and vexation crackling through her\naura. “Betrayal, murder, and war have a way of ruining one’s plans.”\nShe sensed the man’s wariness. Perhaps the senior Luckbringer had\nexpected her to be an entitled girl playing at being an executive, someone he\ncould begin to undermine or manipulate as soon as she began to order him\naround with insufferably false confidence. He was not as certain now.\nShae said, “If I thought it would serve the clan, I would ask the Pillar to\nput someone else behind this desk. But my brother is no fool. He knows how\ndeeply Green Bones value lineage. In a time of war, having another Kaul in\nthe leadership reminds everyone of the Torch and the victories of the past,\nand that reminds people that the clan is strong—that Kekon is strong. With\nthe clan under attack, my personal preferences mean nothing.”\nHami spoke a touch impatiently. “Why have you asked me here?”\nShae laid an expectant gaze on him. “Because I need you to tell me the\ntruth. How difficult will this be? What must I do right away to secure the\nconfidence of the staff and Lantern Men so this place doesn’t fall apart and\nthe Mountain doesn’t sweep in and swallow us? Because if I fail, it will be\nthe end of the No Peak clan.”\nHami regarded her with what Shae sensed was tentative respect. She’d\nreminded him that she was and always had been the Weather Man in waiting\n—trained by Doru, educated at one of the best schools in Espenia, favored by\nthe Torch—merely prematurely installed. And now she was being entirely\nhonest about her credibility challenges. She was astute to have sought his\nadvice at once, a fact that could not help but flatter him. Shae waited for his\nresponse.\nAfter a moment, Hami cleared his throat and said roughly, “You’ll need"

Shae waited for his\nresponse.\nAfter a moment, Hami cleared his throat and said roughly, “You’ll need\nthe senior Luckbringers on your side, the ones who really hold the\nrelationships with the Lantern Men. You should hold a staff meeting as soon\nas possible. If you’re going to make major changes, make them quickly while\nyou’re in this grace period when people are waiting to see what happens in\nthe street war.”\nShae nodded in agreement. “I do intend to make changes. I’ve learned\nenough to know that some of Doru’s actions weakened the clan. Too many\ninvestment decisions were made by him alone; we’ve been cautious and\nreactive, waiting for Lantern Men to come to us instead of seeking out\nopportunities. It’s put us on weak footing against the Mountain.” She knew\nthis was what Hami believed as well, but she treaded carefully now, not\nwanting to press the point and appear to be mining his discontent. “How\nmany people in the office would you say are loyal to Doru and might be a\nproblem if they remained in their current roles?”\n“Fewer than you would think,” Hami said, and Shae saw the gleam in his\neye that told her she’d touched upon their shared dislike for Yun Dorupon\nwith just the right amount of force. “Yun-jen has not been popular recently;\nmany people thought he should’ve retired five years ago. Most of his\nstaunchest allies are old enough that they can be made to retire gracefully\nwith a clan stipend. We’ll find stronger support among the divisions that he\nunderfunded or gutted—Luckbringers that saw good businesses go to the\nMountain. They’ll be eager for change.”\nShae noted Hami’s encouraging use of the word we and asked with\nabsolute bluntness, “Who was the leading candidate to be the next Weather\nMan before Lan-jen was killed and the Pillar appointed me?”\nHami’s jaw tensed, but his honesty prevailed. “Woon Papidonwa.”\n“My brother’s Pillarman,” Shae said thoughtfully, as if considering Woon\nfor the first time. “A good man, respected throughout the clan, though\nperhaps a bit staid. I’ll make him my Chief of Staff.” Let both men believe\nshe had taken their counsel in appointing the other. “The current Master\nLuckbringer, Pado Soreeto—is he loyal to Doru?”\n“Yes. He’s been Master Luckbringer for twelve years.”\n“He’s fired,” Shae declared. “You’re Master Luckbringer now, Hami-jen.\nAssuming that you’re willing to take on the challenge of leading the clan in a\ntime of difficulty, with the same clear-sightedness you’ve shown me today.”\nHami did not look surprised by the sudden promotion, but he hesitated.\nShae waited for his reply without betraying her anxiety. Her worry was that\nHami would resign; not from the clan itself, of course, that was nearly\nimpossible for a Green Bone of his level, but he was certainly free to seek a\nlivelihood outside of the Weather Man’s office, operating one of the clan’s\nbusinesses, or going to work for a prominent Lantern Man.

She had played her cards well, however; after\nanother moment’s thought, Hami said, “I would be honored, Kaul-jen.”\n“The honor is mine,” she said, and offered him the first smile she’d given\nthat day. “As you’ve already advised me, we have to move quickly,\nbeginning with an announcement to the entire senior staff tomorrow. Can we\nmeet again later this afternoon? We need to go into that meeting with a\nstrategy.”\nHami nodded and stood up. The dubiousness he’d so obviously carried\ninto the room with him had been replaced with a mildly bemused sense of\neagerness to get to work. “We’ll be ready.” He saluted her more deeply than\nhe had upon entering, then strode out of the room. When he was gone, Shae\nclosed her eyes and let out a long breath. Two down, several thousand to go.\nThe next afternoon, while workers were tearing apart her office, carrying out\nDoru’s desk and chairs and bringing in new furniture, Shae walked into a\nlong boardroom crowded with the senior Luckbringers of the Weather Man’s\noffice. She’d done her makeup to look older and pulled her hair back into a\ntight knot at the back of her head. She wore a conservative navy skirt suit, but\nthe neckline of her blouse accentuated her two-tier jade choker, and her\nloosened jade bracelets hung at her wrists. Not all Luckbringers wore jade,\nand those that did usually wore less than military members of the clan, but a\nstrong display of green meant status and respect everywhere on Kekon, and\nthe top floor of a tower on Ship Street was no exception.\nShae took stock of the people staring at her. Most of them were men, and\nall of them were older than she was. Woon sat on her right-hand side, Hami\non her left. Shae placed her hands firmly flat on the polished wooden table. “I\nwish I could begin by saying how excited and pleased I am to be here, but\nthat would be a lie. I’m here because my brother, let the gods recognize him,\nwas murdered.” An uncomfortable stillness fell over the room. “Our\nterritories are being taken, our tributes stolen, our businesses are under attack.\nThe Royal Council has called for an audit of the Kekon Jade Alliance, which\nwill show that we are being robbed of our fair share of jade. We’re educated\npeople here. We work in offices and make phone calls and balance books.\nBut at the end of the day, we’re clan.”\nSilence from around the table, though some people nodded.\n“Yun Dorupon served the Torch faithfully for a long time. I respect him\nfor that. But the truth is that we’ve fallen behind, and as a result, have\nbecome prey to our enemies. For the clan to endure, we have to make No\nPeak strong again, stronger than even my grandfather envisioned, because\nthis war against the Mountain threatens not just our clan but our country.”\nShae nodded toward the windows that looked out over the city. “The clans\ncontrol the economy of Kekon.

If the Lantern Men, the Royal Council, the\nEspenians, or the public lose confidence in No Peak’s survival, they’ll lose\nconfidence in the stability of the whole nation. Two and half decades of\nexponential growth could come crashing down. We can’t let that happen.\nThat’s why I ask for your commitment in no less a way than the Horn asks\nhis Fists for their blood.”\nShae inclined her head toward Woon and Hami in turn. “These two men,\nwho I don’t need to introduce to you, have given me that commitment. I’m\nprivileged to have their loyalty and experience on my side. Woon is my right\nhand, he will be the Weather Man’s Shadow. Hami will be Master\nLuckbringer, effective immediately. He has a few words to say about what\nwill happen next.”\nHami said, “We’ll be evaluating all the senior positions over the next two\nweeks. Part of that will involve a detailed accounting of the past activities of\nthe Weather Man’s office. Over the coming weeks and months, we’ll be\nmaking personnel changes as well as reaching out to Lantern Men to recruit\nnew Luckbringers. If you don’t feel you can continue in your role under these\nnew circumstances, the clan will accept your resignation and provide you\nwith a retirement stipend for your service. Decide by the end of the day.”\nShae could sense consternation and disgruntlement from some around the\ntable, but as Hami had predicted, it was less than might be expected. People\nwere used to showing respect to, or at least not challenging, the Pillarman,\nand Hami, whose prior criticisms of Doru were secretly supported by many,\ncapably commanded attention with his Fist-like intensity. With two of the\nmost respected men on this side of the clan flanking her, Shae could feel the\nLuckbringers’ reservations about her slightly tempered. At the very least,\nthere was no open disagreement as Hami and Woon outlined the rest of\nShae’s immediate agenda.\nAt the end of the day, Shae slumped in a stiff new chair in her\ndisassembled office, which smelled of new upholstery and wallpaper. Her\npredecessor’s dark, thickly padded leather furniture and heavily fringed\ndrapery had been replaced by cushioned bench seating, open shelving, and\ncopper globe lamps, some of them still wrapped in plastic and not yet placed\nin their final positions. Most people had gone home and the building had\nfallen largely silent.\nShe felt as if she’d pulled off a minor miracle. She hadn’t lost the Weather\nMan’s office in the first forty-eight hours. Word of her initial success would\nget around to the Lantern Men, and they would give her the benefit of the\ndoubt. For a while. It was the best she could’ve asked for.\nThe phone sitting on the floor rang. Shae picked it up and answered it.\nThe agitated male voice on the other end demanded to talk to Yun Dorupon.\n“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” Shae said.\n“Don’t give me that,” the man on the other end snapped. “You tell him\nthis is the Minister of Tourism calling from the Royal Council.

I need to talk to him.”\n“Yun Dorupon is confined at home due to health issues that have\nunfortunately forced his resignation,” Shae said. That was the story she and\nHilo had concocted to prevent rumors of treason within the clan from getting\nout beyond the top levels of No Peak.\n“His resignation?” the minister fairly shouted. “Who’s the acting Weather\nMan, then? Put me through to him at once.”\n“You’re speaking to her,” Shae said. “I’m the Weather Man. My name is\nKaul Shaelinsan, and if there’s anything further you wish to say, say it to\nme.”\nA stunned silence emanated from the phone receiver—then a mumbled\ncurse, a click, and the hollow drone of the dial tone.\nShae set the receiver back into its cradle and swiveled the chair around to\nstare out the darkening windows. She’d had Doru’s locked filing cabinets\nopened before they were moved out, and on her shiny new desk were tall\nstacks of folders detailing all of No Peak’s operations. She turned back\naround, pulled off one of the top folders, and opened it on her lap. The\nevening was young and she had hours of work ahead of her.\nCHAPTER\n40\nBeing the Pillar\nH\nilo did not like to use Lan’s study; it didn’t suit him. So formal, and with\nso many books—did Lan really read all of those books? But he couldn’t bring\nhimself to change the room either, so he held his meetings at the patio table\nin the courtyard.\nThe Maik brothers looked as tired and unwashed as infantrymen who’d\njust trekked in from the front line—stubbled faces, clothes bloodied and dirty,\nweapons stained. Hilo had managed to shower and change, but he suspected\nhe didn’t look much better. He’d spent all night in the Armpit. After winning\nPoor Man’s Road, he was not about to let any of that district be retaken. The\nfighting had spilled into Spearpoint and Junko, but at dawn, No Peak still\nheld the whole of its previous territory. That wasn’t the case elsewhere in the\ncity.\nHilo tore apart a bread roll and ate it as he regarded the silent Maiks. At\nlast he said, “Neither of you wants to talk first, so it must be bad.”\nKehn said, “We’ve lost the southern part of the Docks. Three of our Fists\nand eleven of our Fingers were killed yesterday and last night. We took some\nMountain jade too, but not enough. Gont and his men are camped out in the\nTwice Lucky.”\nHilo said, “Which of our Fists?”\n“Asei, Ronu, and Satto.”\nThe Pillar’s face twisted. The Maiks felt his aura flare like a flame.

He suspected Gont had given the poor man\na choice between switching allegiance and something far worse, but the\nunwelcome truth was that if the Twice Lucky could be taken and a long-\nstanding No Peak man like Mr. Une turned, none of the clan’s holdings were\nsafe. He scowled as he voiced his gloomy thought to the Maiks: “Even the\nbest Lantern Man is like a squid that’ll change into any color to save itself.”\n“We have to take it back,” Tar insisted. “Gont is taunting us by sitting in\nthere. From where he is now, he can push further into the Docks, or attack\nJunko or the Forge. The men who took Satto’s jade are in there; we can take\nit back for him.”\n“And where would you pull from, to mount an assault on the Twice\nLucky?” Hilo demanded. “We’d need the best of our remaining Fists and a\nsmall army of Fingers to face Gont head on. I know the Armpit can’t spare\nany. What about Sogen? I sent you to win that district; is it done?”\n“No,” Tar said, chastised.\nWen came out and set a plate of cubed watermelon and a jug of mint\nwater on the table for them. “Thank you, love,” Hilo said. He cupped a hand\non the back of her thigh as she poured them glasses of water. Wen was\nwearing a soft lime-green dress and heeled sandals that accentuated her\nshapely calves. It was one of the only good things in Hilo’s life these days, to\nhave Wen in the Horn’s house. It was Kehn’s house now, so everything was\nstill proper, but she was only a short walk from the main residence, and most\nimportantly, safe behind estate gates. She smiled down at him, a little wanly,\nthen drew away to let her fiancé and brothers continue to talk.\n“We’ll take back the Twice Lucky,” Hilo said, changing his tone to let Tar\nknow he was not truly angry with him. “But not now. Gont will be expecting\nan immediate counterattack. Even if we drive them out of the Docks, the cost\nwill be too high.” He shook his head. “We’ll strike back at a better time.”\n“And when is that?” Kehn picked a mint leaf from his glass and chewed\non it.\n“You’re the Horn now, Kehn,” Hilo said, eyes narrowing. “You tell me.\nYou figure it out, then you tell me, and I give you permission to act or not.\nThat’s how it was between me and Lan. I never went against him, but I didn’t\nwait to be told what to do either. I made the calls that were mine to make;\neverything else I went to him to speak my mind and ask for what I wanted.”"

I wouldn’t be\ntreating you like family if I wasn’t honest with you.” Hilo drained his water\nin a long swallow and pressed the cool glass to his forehead for a minute\nbefore setting it back down. “I’m making some changes. You know Woon\nhas moved into the Weather Man’s office to help Shae. It’s the best place for\nhim, where he can be the most useful. Tar, I’m making you my Pillarman\nnow.”\nTar blinked. Then he blurted, “Have I failed you that badly, Hilo-jen?” He\npushed back in his chair as if to stand up. His jade aura roiled with confusion.\n“I’m not a … secretary! I’m a Horn’s man; I belong here on the greener side\nof the clan, you know that. You want me to make phone calls and maintain\nthe gardens?”\n“You won’t be doing any of that shit.” Hilo pinned the younger Maik to\nhis chair with a glare of renewed impatience. “You’ll have staff to do that\nsort of thing. I need you to do other work for me. It’ll be important work, and\nyou’ll answer only to me. It’s not something I can have the Horn handling,\nnot when he has his hands full as it is, fighting the war. You’ll pick two of\nyour men to help you—choose first-rank Fingers who you trust to never let\nout a word in carelessness, the ones who’re most hungry to wet their blades.\nThat should give you an idea that I’m making some changes to the\nPillarman’s role.”\nTar sat back, still confused, but mollified into temporary silence.\nHilo turned to Kehn. “Who will you make your new First Fist?”\nKehn scratched his jaw. “Juen, or Vuay.”\n“Which one?” Hilo demanded.\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, “Juen.”\nHilo nodded. “Good.” He looked about to say more, but all three men\npaused at the Perception of Shae’s jade aura, crackling with frustration, as it\nbore down toward them from inside the main house. Hilo said, “I believe the\nWeather Man would like to talk to me.” His mouth curved in a faintly\nsardonic smile.\n“The joys of being the Pillar,” Tar said, as he and Kehn stood up.\nHilo’s smile vanished at once. “I never wanted to be Pillar. There are\npeople who’re going to pay for the fact that I’m in Lan’s place. Don’t ever\nforget that.”\nThe Maik brothers glanced at each other, then obviously deciding they’d\nspent enough time on their captain’s bad side today, they saluted him and\nwithdrew.\nHilo felt his pockets for a pack of cigarettes, and finding them empty,\npicked at the bowl of watermelon until Shae’s shadow fell over him and she"

Hilo couldn’t help smiling as he\nlooked at her. Besides Wen living next door in the Horn’s house, the only\nother thing he was thankful for was Shae’s return. His sister had been like a\nshadow of herself, embarrassing for Hilo to even look upon; she’d made him\nfeel guilty and angry every time he saw her, as if she were deliberately trying\nto shame him and the family with her every decision. The confrontation in\nher apartment building over Caun had irked him for days. Now the icy burn\nof her aura, its familiar strength and ferocity directed at him, was a\nbittersweet comfort to Hilo. If only, if only, it had come sooner.\n“Did you hear me?” Shae asked.\n“I have a favor to ask you, first,” Hilo said. “I’d like you to find a job for\nWen. Something in the clan, in a safe part of the city, where she can feel\nuseful. Her job now, it’s not good enough for her. She can type and do\nsecretary things, but she can do more than that. It would make her a lot\nhappier.”\n“This is what you want me to spend my time doing?” Shae asked.\n“It won’t take much time. Have Woon ask around; there are always\nLantern Men needing good help. It’s not urgent, but I know it’s hard on her\nnow, with me and her brothers gone all the time, and it not being safe to go\nout much.” He glanced at the Horn’s house, caught a brief glimpse of Wen’s\nfigure in the kitchen window.\n“Fine,” Shae said. “I’ll ask around. Can we talk about the council?”\nHilo felt suddenly tired. “What do I need to meet with the council for?”\nThe Weather Man dropped her chin in incredulity. “The Royal Council is\nthe governing body of the country. It’s shitting itself over all the violence and\nthe disruption to business, foreign affairs, jade income, everything.\nCouncilmen are calling the Weather Man’s office nonstop. Chancellor Son is\nbeside himself that you haven’t gone to consult with him once yet. They\nexpect to hear from the Pillar. Lan used to meet with them regularly; they\nhaven’t been able to reach you at all.”\n“I’ve been busy,” he said drily.\n“Leading your troops,” she said. “You’re still acting like the Horn. You\ndon’t belong on the front lines anymore. That’s Maik Kehn’s job now.”\n“He needs my help.”\n“Then maybe you shouldn’t have made him Horn.”"

That’s Maik Kehn’s job now.”\n“He needs my help.”\n“Then maybe you shouldn’t have made him Horn.”\nHilo himself had been harsh on Kehn earlier, but he hated to hear anyone\nhe cared about criticized in their absence. He shot a warning glower at his\nsister. “Kehn is one of my best Green Bones; he’d die a hundred times over\nfor this clan.”\nShae sat unmoved. “He’s an unimaginative soldier, you know that.”\n“I was Horn until last week, and it’s my place to manage the Horn now,\nnot yours.” Coldly, “I’m really not in the mood to be lectured by my little\nsister. I didn’t appoint you as Weather Man so you could question all my\ndecisions.”\nShae sneered a little. “You want my resignation?”\nHilo sneered back. “Damnit, Shae, why do you have to bait me all the\ntime?” He put a foot on the edge of the empty chair next to him and kicked it\nover. Its metal frame clattered loudly on the patio tile. Hilo slumped in his\nseat. She’d always been like this, always taken some cruel satisfaction in\ngoading him, knowing that she could count on their grandfather to take her\nside. The angrier and more violent he became, the more she seemed to gain in\nfavor—always the more clever and disciplined grandchild. Really, the way\nthe two of them had fought as children, it was a good thing Lan had been\nthere or they might have actually killed each other.\nNeither of them spoke for a minute. Their jade auras grappled warily,\nprickling against each other like static charges. Finally, Hilo said, “We can’t\nbe going against each other, Shae, not anymore. I asked for your oath and you\ngave it, and that means you don’t show me disrespect, and you don’t do\nthings like that.” He stabbed a finger in the direction of the Weather Man’s\nhouse. “Pardoning Doru without even asking me.” He spat a watermelon seed\nin disgust. “Doru! He was supposed to be feeding worms months ago, but\nLan was too soft when it came to Grandda’s feelings. You’re the same way\nnow, letting that snake live just to keep the old man company.”\n“You agreed to give it a chance,” Shae retorted. “I hate Doru even more\nthan you do, but Grandda left his room for the first time in days this morning.\nI saw them from the window, Hilo. I was working all night, same as you. I\nsaw Doru pushing Grandda’s wheelchair into the courtyard to have their tea\nand chess at this very table, like they always do. He was smiling. Even\nwithout all his jade, he was smiling. He still has life in him. This is worth it,\nfor Grandda’s sake.”\n“Worth having a traitor living with us? Worth sparing two of my Fingers\nto guard him day and night? Doru’s got nothing to lose. He’s dangerous to\nus.”\n“He’s an old man whom you’ve stripped of jade,” Shae replied. “He went\nentirely against what Lan wanted, and that makes him a traitor and a bad"

It would be easier for all\nconcerned if Grandda was too far gone for Doru to make a difference. “The\npoint is,” he ground out, “you did it without coming to me. You did what you\nfelt like, without doing it properly, just like—” He caught himself, but Shae’s\nface had already stiffened.\n“Like what?” she asked coolly. “Like moving to Espenia? Like dating\nJerald? Like taking off my jade without permission?” There was, to Hilo’s\ngreat surprise, a sliver of hurt in her voice. “That’s what you were going to\nsay, isn’t it?”\nThis whole conversation was leaving a bad taste in Hilo’s mouth. Three of\nhis Fists were dead—good men, worthy Green Bones, all of them. He should\nbe bringing funerary envelopes to their families. He should be out in the city\nwhere he was needed, where the war was being fought and decided, not\nsitting here, bickering with his sister. “I told you,” he said quietly, mustering\nall his remaining patience, “I’ve forgotten the past. When you push me like\nyou do, sometimes I forget that I’ve forgotten it. I won’t bring it up again. It’s\nover. What matters now is that it’s the two of us. You’re my Weather Man,\nand I’m grateful. So say what you came to tell me.”\nShae studied him silently for a minute, as if trying to decide whether to\naccept his words at face value. So cynical, his sister. Finally, she seemed to\ngive in; her jade aura drew in a pace and settled into a grudging hum. “The\ncouncil is calling for a negotiated truce between the clans.”\nHilo’s lips curled over his teeth. “Truce? There won’t be any truce. Who\nagrees to a truce when his brother lies in the ground? Besides, what say does\nthe Royal Council of jadeless puppets have over clan affairs? This is a matter\nbetween Green Bones, not politicians.”\n“The Royal Council is concerned with national issues. A war between the\ntwo largest clans counts as a national issue, hence the Royal Council is\nconcerned.”\nHilo frowned. “The chancellor is a No Peak man. Shouldn’t the council be\nin our pocket? Don’t we have enough Lantern Men who sit on it?”\n“Yes, and they’re not happy about being ignored. They’re not Fists and\nFingers who’ll do as you tell them to, Hilo. They’re loyal to the clan because\nof money and influence, not because of jade and brotherhood. If you don’t\naddress their concerns, their opinions will spread to the other Lantern Men in\nthe clan.

If it gets bad enough, our businesses will\nturn en masse, without Gont even having to shed another drop of blood. On\ntop of that, there are those on the council who aren’t clan affiliated, who will\ngain political power if the war drags on and public opinion starts turning\nagainst all Green Bones.”\nHilo tilted his head back and stared gloomily into the branches of the\ncherry tree. Shae leaned forward and tapped hard on the back of his hand to\nforce his attention back to her. “And here’s the most important thing to\nconsider. The council is the political body that deals with the Espenians, and\nall other foreign states and companies. If you ignore the council, if you make\nit appear toothless and incapable of maintaining order, what’s to stop the\nforeigners from deciding that they no longer have to deal openly with the\ngovernment either? What’s to prevent them from going directly to the one\nclan that’s been accumulating jade and producing shine behind the backs of\nthe others? That’s not us, by the way.”\n“You’ve made your point,” Hilo grumbled. “I’ll meet with Chancellor\nSon and the Royal Council. What am I supposed to say to them?”\n“That depends,” Shae said. “What will it take for us to win the war?”\nHilo drew in a pensive breath and let it out again. He wouldn’t consider\nanything a true victory unless Ayt and Gont were feeding worms and their\nclan in ruins, but he had to concede that a more attainable goal in the near\nterm would be to win all the battleground districts and force enough crippling\nbusiness concessions on the Mountain that it could no longer hope to conquer\nNo Peak. “If our Lantern Men stay with us, and we hold our remaining\nterritories until the end of the year, we’ll be in a better position,” he mused.\n“The class coming out of the Academy is bigger and stronger than what the\nMountain will get out of Wie Lon this year. We’ll have enough Fingers to fill\nin our gaps by spring.” He sucked the inside of his cheek, then added in a less\noptimistic tone, “Things could go badly for us, though, between now and\nthen. The Mountain knows our situation. They’ll spill a lot of blood trying to\nend this quickly.”\nShae nodded. “They also won’t want the war to go on long enough for the\nKJA audit results to be publicized and the reform bills to be enacted. Even if\nthere’s nothing to be done about the jade they’ve already stolen, if the public\nturns against them, it will be harder for them to keep hold of disputed and\nconquered territories.” The Weather Man took a swallow of water, staring\nthoughtfully across the courtyard as she spoke. “The council wants to bring\nyou and Ayt into a room to begin negotiations. Let them do it. Show them\nthat we’re willing to talk. It’ll mollify the Lantern Men, keep them on our\nside, and it’ll prevent the Espenians from taking any action so long as they\nthink we might come to a peaceful resolution. The longer we hold out, the\nbetter our negotiating position will become. We can use the council to stall\nuntil spring.”\nThe Pillar sighed. “These sorts of things—the council, the KJA, the"

We can use the council to stall\nuntil spring.”\nThe Pillar sighed. “These sorts of things—the council, the KJA, the\nEspenians, these political things. They’re not for me. I never paid attention to\nthem.”\n“You have to now,” Shae said firmly, though her eyes held an unexpected\nhint of sympathy. “There’s only so much I can do as Weather Man. You’re\nthe Pillar. We can win every battle on the streets and still lose the clan if you\ndon’t realize that the war is bigger than you think. Right now, Ayt is on a\ndifferent level than we are. She’s been working for months or years to gain\nadvantage over us beyond city territory—producing shine offshore,\ncircumventing the KJA and seizing jade … things that no Green Bone clan\nhas thought to do before. Unless we can rise to that level and beat her on it,\nwe can’t survive, much less destroy the Mountain.” A matter-of-fact\nvindictiveness flattened her voice. “Not just defeat it, but destroy it.”\nHilo tapped his fingers thoughtfully on the metal arm of the chair as he\nregarded his sister. At last he said, “I’m not bringing up the past against you,\nI promised just now I wouldn’t, but tell me: Who broke it off, you or Jerald?”\nShae sat up and stared. “What does that have to do with anything?”\nHe smiled, with an ease he hadn’t felt for days. “I’m just curious.”\n“It was mostly mutual.” She frowned, then quietly amended, “He did.”\nHilo stood from his chair. A dozen aches and pains made themselves\nknown throughout his body, but he didn’t lose his smile. “Figures,” he said.\nShae slid him a dangerous sideways look as he came around the table and\ncircled behind her chair. “What is that supposed to mean?”\n“When we were little kids, I used to beat you up, but you’d never give in.\nNever. You’d spit in my face and only come after me later when I wasn’t\nlooking. You didn’t let things go. Nearly bashed in my skull that one time, do\nyou remember? Then in the Academy, you were like some kind of machine;\nyou never let anyone see you sweat, least of all me. You scared the shit out of\nboys. You were always too smart, too dangerous, for some foreign water–\nblooded pretty face in a uniform, don’t you know that? For his own sake, he\nfigured it out before you did, is all.” Hilo draped his arms over Shae’s\nshoulders and hugged her, then spoke into her ear. “I could still kill him for\nyou.”\n“Screw you, Hilo,” she snapped. “I can kill my ex-boyfriends myself.”\nHe laughed, half expecting her to break one of his wrists just to make a\npoint. When she didn’t, he kissed her brow, then let go of her and walked\nback to the house.\nCHAPTER\n41\nFirst of Class\nA\nt Kaul Dushuron Academy, Pre-Trials are held two months prior to the\nfinal Trials, which occur at the end of the year before the arrival of the rainy\nspring season.

Unlike the Trials, which span two weeks and are closed,\nsecretive examinations administered by the Academy’s schoolmasters, the\nPre-Trials are a one-day, public affair resembling a sports meet. Though the\nsix jade disciplines are the focus of the event, in true Kekonese fashion,\ncompetitive matches in poetry recital, speed math, and logic games, among\nothers, are also held, attracting their own ardent followers and bettors.\nA month ago, Anden had been excited about Pre-Trials, but now he saw it\nonly as an obstacle before graduation, and appreciated it only insofar as it\ngave him something to focus on. He’d eaten his breakfast silently and\nmechanically in the dining hall that morning, unable to share in the nervous\nbanter of the other year-eights around him. He’d consulted the posted\nschedule and given his morning events his best effort, but didn’t linger after\neach one to find out his scores, nor did he join the crowd of classmates who\ncongregated around the bulletin board in the hall to see the updated rankings\nafter each event. Ostensibly, the Pre-Trials were a condensed, low-pressure\nway for graduating students to prepare for the more arduous exams to come,\nbut most year-eights—at least, those angling for a position in the clan, which\nwas a majority of them—were as anxious about it as they were about the real\ntests at the end of the year. Family members came to watch Pre-Trials—so\ndid clan leadership. It was typical for the Horn and his top Fists to be there,\nscouting which graduates they would take as Fingers. Senior Luckbringers\nwould be observing the academic competitions. Schoolmasters would be\neither reasonably harsh, or sadistically draconian for the next two months\ndepending on how their pupils performed today.\nAnden could not muster the will to care. He barely spoke to anyone at\nlunch and left the hall as soon as he’d eaten, arriving early to wait his turn at\nthe tower event. It was overcast and cool enough that the participants wore T-\nshirts under their uniform tunics and their breaths fogged in the air. There\nwas a slight wind, but it wasn’t strong enough that Anden was worried about\nit. He craned his neck to see up to the highest platform crowning the several\nthat ringed the thick fifty-foot-tall wooden pole. When he was called up, he\nrubbed the training band around his wrist out of habit, running his thumb\nover the jade stones. A bell sounded.\nHe ran to build momentum, then leapt, Lightly, platform to platform,\nusing both arms and legs to catch and propel himself upward with each\ngathering and heaving of jade energy that it took to send his body up into the\nair against gravity. The ground receded rapidly; the seconds elongated so that\nas he sprang from one narrow foothold to the next, it felt as if he dangled in\nspace for so long that he might lose his grasp on Lightness and fall to a bone-\nshattering finale. His heart raced, but his deep breaths were steady and he felt\nno anxiety. He didn’t care if he won or lost. He didn’t even care if he fell. He\nkept his eyes focused on the top platform, and when he reached it, he heard"

He\nkept his eyes focused on the top platform, and when he reached it, he heard\nthe bell sound from far below and then a round of stomping applause loud\nenough for him to know that he’d gotten the best time of the day so far.\nUp here the wind was stronger; it whistled in his ears. He could see so far\nout: not only the rest of the Academy grounds and Widow’s Park, but all the\nway to the flat gleam of the reservoir and forested Palace Hill with the Kaul\nhouse in the north, and the quilt of downtown Janloon to the east—a\npatchwork of clay roofs and concrete buildings and steel skyscrapers. He\nwished he could sit, dangle his legs for a minute, imagine that the city was as\npeaceful as it looked from up here.\nHe came back down; it took only a little Lightness to descend. Dudo was\nbouncing on the balls of his feet near the base of the tower, ready to take the\nnext run. “You won that handily,” he said to Anden. “None of the rest of us\ncan beat that time.”\n“I haven’t been eating much,” Anden replied, to be polite, though it was\nalso true. Not that it would make any difference, and not that the Pre-Trials\nwere the reason for his lack of appetite. He passed Dudo, took a towel from\none of the volunteer year-sixes and wiped the sweat from his face. When he\nlooked up, he saw Maik Kehn in the front row of the audience, and he began\nto look around, thinking for a moment that must mean Hilo was here too.\nThen he remembered that Maik Kehn was now the Horn, and no one\nexpected the new Pillar to have the time to make an appearance here this\nyear. Maik caught Anden’s eye and nodded to him.\nAt this time last year, Anden had been one of the year-sevens watching\nfrom the back of the crowd. It had been a damp, cold day; Anden\nremembered rubbing and blowing into his hands, and stamping his feet to\nkeep warm. Hilo had been here; he’d sat right at the front with Maik Tar.\nAnden had caught glimpses of his cousin chatting with Maik, remarking on\none student or another, smiling and applauding and apparently enjoying\nhimself a great deal. During the breaks, he stood up and stretched and\nwandered onto the field to speak with the year-eights. They treated him like a\ngod in their midst, saluting him deeply, hanging on to his every word, but the\nHorn put them at ease. He clapped them on the backs and complimented their\nefforts; he joked about the schoolmasters and told stories of when he’d been\nat the Academy and the trouble he’d gotten into as a student. Anden had hung\nback, watching.\n“You’ll be up there next year.” Lan had come up behind Anden, startling\nhim.\n“Lan-jen,” Anden said. “I didn’t know the Pillar came to Pre-Trials.”\n“I like to come if I can,” Lan said. “At least to hand out the awards and"

I’ll come for the whole day, when it’s your turn.”\nAnden had looked away, embarrassed that the Pillar would make any special\neffort for him.\n“Did they have Pre-Trials when you were here?” Anden had asked.\nLan shook his head. “I was in the very first graduating class. Grandda and\ntwo of his teachers founded the Academy the year after the Many Nations\nWar ended. I suppose it existed before that, but not as a real school, just\nGreen Bones training students in basements and secret camps. There were\nonly fifty of us that first year. We had the one building and that training\nfield.” He gestured around the Academy grounds. “When I come here now,\nall this seems new. Though I guess it has been sixteen years since I left. Time\ngoes by quickly, and things change.”\nThe Pillar’s voice held a tint of regret, and Anden wondered if he was\nthinking about something in particular. He never found out; Lan’s presence\nhad been noticed and some Academy faculty members had come over to pay\ntheir respects. Anden had sidled away, to watch the year-eights enviously and\nwonder how, since he possessed neither Hilo’s magnetism nor Lan’s gravity,\nhe’d ever live up to being a Kaul himself.\nLan was not here today, as he’d promised he’d be. For Anden, that one\nsimple fact drained all meaning from the spectacle. Pre-Trials seemed a\nhollow, shallow thing now, a pantomime he had to go through to get to the\nreal goal: graduation, jade, a place in the clan, vengeance for what had been\ndone to his family.\nAnden’s next event was knife throwing, in which he placed second to\nLott, who everyone knew was unbeatable. His final event was Channeling, or\nas all the Academy students called it, the Massacre of the Mice. Life can only\nChannel into life, but offensive Channeling was too dangerous for students to\nperform on each other in this kind of competitive public setting. So at Pre-\nTrials the year-eights stood behind a table in the packed Gathering Hall and\neach was given a cage of five white lab mice. They were not allowed to touch\nthe mice with anything but one finger, and the judges disqualified anyone\ntrying to cheat by using Strength or Deflection on the small creatures.\nVarious attempts had been made over the years to try to upgrade the popular\nevent to be more exciting—who didn’t want to see a man try to Channel into\na bull? For practical and budgetary reasons, the proposals were always\noverruled.\nChanneling was Anden’s strongest discipline, and he tried not to think\nabout how it was well known to have been his mother’s as well. When the\nbell went off, he didn’t bother to try to touch the mice with his fingers. They\nwere too nimble for that. He hovered both hands over the cage, quickly\nPerceiving all five tiny throbbing lives burning like tea lights.

A brief, electric warmth tingled up his arm as the animal’s life\nescaped. Four more quick, strong pops of Channeled energy and Anden\nstepped back, hands behind his back to indicate he was done. When the bell\nwent off, two other students in the round of eight had killed all their mice, but\nAnden had the winning time of the day.\nHe felt a little sad as the judge held up his cage to the applause of the\nspectators. The five tiny bodies had been alive minutes ago and now they\nwere gone, so easily snuffed out. It was the way of all things, to live and die\nat the whim of more powerful creatures, but he didn’t care enough about the\nPre-Trials to feel as if he’d had to kill them. It was a foolish guilt; he’d surely\nwon the First of Class award today—why couldn’t he try to be happy, even\nfor a little while?\n“Congratulations,” Ton said, as they walked out of the Hall.\n“You looked as if you weren’t even really trying,” Heike added.\nOther fellow students came up to offer him praise as the entire exhausted\nbut elated group lined up in the central field behind the Gathering Hall,\nwaiting for the presentation of awards and the final closing words from\nGrandmaster Le. With the weeks ticking down to graduation, they’d become\nmore interested in Anden all of a sudden, more aware of the fact that he\nwould soon be the highest-ranked Green Bone among them, likely their\nleader, and clearly favored by the fierce young Pillar.\nAnden tried to nod and smile and say a few words of thanks here and\nthere, but he felt strange and detached, almost apart from his own body. He’d\nbeen wearing jade and expending jade energy all day, and after his recent\nsolitude, the clamor of so many other auras was overwhelming. Ever since\nthe funeral, he’d kept to himself, stuck to the routine motions of training and\nschoolwork. The other students were tentative around him, uncertain of what\nto say to someone who grieved Kaul Lan as a real person rather than as the\nPillar whose death had ignited the revenge killings on Poor Man’s Road and\nsent Janloon spiraling into a storm of clan violence. It was just as well they\ndidn’t try; he wouldn’t have known how to accept their sympathy. All he\nknew now was that remorse had a natural limit. After a certain amount of\ntime, it finished eating a person hollow and had to alchemize into anger that\ncould be turned outward lest it consume its host entirely.\nAnden knew he was to blame for Lan’s death. He did not believe Hilo’s\nreassurances to the contrary. But Lan himself was to blame as well. So too\nwere Shae, and Hilo. He couldn’t hate his own family for their failings, but\nhe could hate those who’d made those failings fatal. He could hate Gam\nOben, whose final blow had done its deadly work after all. He could hate Ayt\nMada, and Gont Asch, and the entire Mountain clan. And shine, that\nEspenian-brewed poison. He hated it."

He hated it.\nLan had been ambushed, they said, by Mountain clan members armed\nwith machine guns, who, when they failed to shoot him, drowned him in the\nharbor. That’s all Anden knew—all anyone knew, it seemed. Even the\nidentity of Lan’s killers was unknown. Whoever they were, and whatever had\nhappened that night, Anden was certain they wouldn’t have succeeded if Lan\nhad been himself. If he hadn’t been injured, unstable, drug-addled, as Anden\nhad seen him. If Anden had gone to Hilo like he should have, or if he’d told\nShae everything he knew that evening after the relayball game, maybe they\nwould have convinced Lan to wear less of his jade until he was better, taken\naway the shine so he couldn’t use it as a crutch, or at least known enough to\nmake sure he wasn’t alone that night …\n“Emery.” Someone nudged him. “Go on.”\nAnden looked up. Grandmaster Le had apparently already made his\nspeech and announced the winners of the individual events, then called\nAnden’s name. The grandmaster was now waiting expectantly to present\nAnden with the First of Class award, his thin mouth slowly turning down in a\nscowl with each second of delay.\nAnden hurried up to the front and touched his hands to his forehead while\nbending deeply and apologetically. The First of Class award was coveted\nbecause the reward was great—a single jade stud presented in a ceremonial\ngreen velvet box. It would be affixed to his training band and guarantee that\nso long as he received passing grades in the final Trials, he would graduate\nwith four jade stones—the maximum anyone could receive at the Academy.\nAnden accepted the box, saluted again, and returned to his place. He felt no\ngreat triumph, just a sense of grim relief.\nGrandmaster Le said a few other things about the upcoming Trials and the\nneed for graduating Green Bones to be especially well prepared in this time\nof strife and uncertainty, then wished all the graduates luck and called the\nPre-Trials to a close. The crowd began to break up. Families and groups of\nfriends gathered for photographs. Anden turned to go back to his dormitory\nroom, but his classmates were milling together nearby and he caught the\nsound of Lott Jin’s voice in the conversation.\n“The Kauls are fooling themselves if they think they’ll get many Fingers\nout of the Academy this year,” Lott was saying. “Not when following the\nHorn means ending up as worm food.”\n“Well, no one thinks Maik’s the Horn that Kaul was,” Pau conceded.\nHeike agreed. “Patrolling and collecting tribute is one thing. Even clean-\nbladed duels don’t always end in death, not if someone concedes. But\nfighting enemy Green Bones with more experience and more jade, who want\nto pick the stones off your dead body? That’s different.”\n“In good times, everyone wants to be a Finger, at least for a couple of\nyears. You get respect for it, even if you don’t win jade or make Fist. But in a\nreal war?” Lott’s voice rose in scorn. “They’re going to find out that not\neveryone’s as foolish and jade-hungry as—”"

He couldn’t say why he did so now—he’d heard talk\nlike this before and kept quiet, but now his jaw and fists were clenched, the\nprecious green box he’d just won was gripped tightly in one hand. The others\nstudents stood astonished as Anden rounded on Lott. “I’m sick of listening to\nyou talk shit all the time.” He was more stunned than anyone by the disgust\nin his voice. “Any coward more concerned with saving his own skin than\ndefending the clan in a time of war doesn’t deserve jade.”\nThey were entirely taken aback. They’d never seen him this angry before,\nnot in eight whole years. But Lan was dead, and things were different now.\nDifferent from how they’d been in the Gathering Hall on the night of the\ntyphoon, back when Anden had still believed that his cousins had everything\nunder control and there was no need for him to speak up.\nEven in grief Anden had dwelled on the fact that Lott Jin had said barely a\nword to him in weeks, had seemed to outright avoid him. Seeing Lott’s\nmouth hang open in amazement now gave Anden a burning rush of cruel\nsatisfaction. Why was Lott always so selfish? Did he think that he was the\nonly one who ever feared for his life, or who wished things were not the way\nthey were? How dare he speak so arrogantly, as if he could simply give up on\nthe clan and walk away?\nLott’s mouth snapped shut. “Have I offended you, Emery?” He drew out\nthe syllables of Anden’s name in an exaggerated Espenian accent,\nemphasizing their foreign sound. “I didn’t realize it bothered you so much to\nhear anyone question the clan or say a single word against the great Kaul\nfamily.” Lott’s eyes glittered. “You might be First of Class, but none of us\nhave taken oaths or been given rank yet. You can’t tell us what to do or how\nwe can talk.”\n“We’re year-eights,” Anden shot back. “No Peak is depending on us. The\nlower years will be watching to see what we do. That kind of talk is bad for\nthe clan, and you were having it out here in the middle of the field, where\nanyone could hear you.” He flung his rebuke at the other student in a\nmounting fury; doubts were like viruses, easily spread from mouth to mouth.\n“Your father’s a Fist; you should know better.”\n“Don’t tell me what I ought to know, and don’t talk to me about my da,”\nLott snarled, and suddenly there was a dangerous charge in the air. They were\nboth wearing jade today, and Anden felt the other young man’s aura flare like\na grease fire. The huddle of year-eights shifted nervously. Dueling was\nforbidden on Academy grounds and there were instructors nearby. Already,\nsome of the other milling students and their relatives on the field were\npausing to glance over at their group.\n“Come on, now,” said Ton, stepping partway between Anden and Lott."

Maybe we were talking a little too\nfreely. I don’t think there was insult meant from anyone here, was there?” He\nlooked pointedly at both Lott and Anden.\n“I suspect there was,” Lott said angrily, but then his gaze slid abruptly\nbehind Anden’s shoulder and he stopped. In the same instant, Anden felt the\nunmistakable liquid heat of Kaul Hilo’s jade aura wash over him.\n“Andy.” Hilo put a hand on Anden’s shoulder and joined their circle as if\nhe did it every day. “Kehn told me everything—said you were incredible\ntoday. All I caught was the awards. Had to come see you up there as First of\nClass, at least. Sorry I couldn’t make it earlier.” Hilo’s lips rose in the\nlopsided insouciant smile he’d always possessed, but Anden could see that\nhe’d changed. His youthful appearance was shot through with darker\nshadows that played around his eyes and mouth. There were angles to his\nface and fresh scars on his hands. The Pillar’s presence quieted the group at\nonce, disrupted its direction like a boulder landing in the center of a small\nstream.\n“I … I’m glad you could come at all, Hilo-jen,” Anden managed.\nHilo said, “Introduce me to your friends, Andy.”\nAnden went around the circle. When they reached Lott, Hilo said, with\ngreat interest, “The son of Lott Penshugon? I’m sorry your father couldn’t be\nhere to watch you in Pre-Trials. I’m sure he wanted to come, but I’m\ncounting on him to hold the Sogen district for No Peak.” The Pillar appeared\nnot to notice Lott’s tense shoulders and rigid face, and said even more\namiably, “I’ll tell him how well you did. He says you can throw a knife even\nbetter than he does, and you’re the sort that can carry his jade, I can see that\nalready. You should talk to Maik-jen. Anytime; no need to wait until the\ngraduation ceremony to do it.”\nLott’s face and neck flushed. “Thank you, Kaul-jen.” His jaw twitched as\nhe saluted Hilo, his eyes jumping sideways to Anden for a suspicious instant.\n“That goes for all of you,” the Pillar went on, his eyes sweeping around\nthe small circle of year-eights. “I’ve been telling Andy you’re the biggest,\nstrongest class to come out of the Academy in years. I’m already old\ncompared to you. You’re the future of the clan and a credit to your families.”\n“Thank you, Kaul-jen,” Ton said, and the others echoed him.\n“Our blood for the clan,” Dudo added fervently, dipping deeply in salute.\n“Soon, my friend, but not yet,” said Hilo lightly, tugging Dudo up by the\nback of his collar. “You’ve got two more months to be an Academy student.\nNot just a student, but a year-eight.

It’s practically your duty to make the\nlives of the lower years miserable and to get the masters to declare you the\nworst class ever by the time you leave. Every class does it. I’d tell you some\nstories from my year, but it’s the night after Pre-Trials—why aren’t you all\nracing off campus to get drunk by now?”\nSeveral of them laughed, then thanked the Pillar again and hurried away\nwith backward glances. Lott cast one final unconvinced look at both Anden\nand Hilo, then followed the others.\nHilo walked with Anden across the mostly empty field. His voice\nchanged, lost its lightness. “You and Lott’s son were ready to have it out\nback there. What were you having words with him about when I arrived?”\n“It wasn’t important,” Anden mumbled. As angry as he was at Lott Jin, he\nwas hesitant to speak badly of him in front of the Pillar. But Hilo continued\nto wait expectantly for an answer, until Anden felt he had to respond. “He\nwas saying the clan won’t get as many Fingers as you think it will. That those\nwho have a choice won’t want to take such a risk during wartime.”\n“We won’t get oaths from all of them, that’s true. Maybe not even as\nmany as we’re hoping for. Is that why you were so angry?”\n“It was the way Lott was talking, Hilo-jen. He was being disrespectful.”\nHilo nodded in understanding. “You were putting him in his place, then?”\n“I …” Anden wasn’t sure. There was the faintest teasing suggestion in\nHilo’s voice and in the curve of his eyebrow. Anden was appalled to think\nthat his cousin might suspect some other reason for his emotional outburst at\nLott. “I had to say something.”\n“Andy,” said Hilo sternly, “a lot of those boys who’re your classmates\nnow will be your Fingers later. You’ve got to learn: There’s a way to\ndiscipline a man so he hates you forever, and another way to do it so he loves\nyou all the more for it. To know what it is, you have to know the man. What\ndo you know about your friend back there?”\nAnden hesitated. What did he know about Lott Jin?\nHilo said, “I’ll tell you what I know: His old man’s a boor. As loyal and\ngreen as they come, lucky for us, but Lott Pen walks through life like he’s\nbegging for someone to start something with him. Always glaring, never a\nkind word to anyone. The sort of person who kicks dogs. No wonder his son\nmouths off and has such a gloomy face. Not sure how to be his own man,\nwith a father like that. Not sure what to think of the clan.”\nThey were walking in the opposite direction of the dormitories, but Anden\nfollowed without a word.

He’d have taken any\nscolding or beating from you so long as it made him seem better than his old\nman.”\nNo one could deny that Kaul Hilo had a way with his people. It came\nfrom a genuine concern, and was a talent more mysterious to Anden than any\njade ability. They passed through the entry gates and walked down to the\nparking lot where the Duchesse was parked. “People are like horses, Andy.\nFingers and Fists too—everyone. Any old horse will run when it’s whipped,\nbut only fast enough to avoid the whipping,” Hilo said. “Racehorses, though,\nthey run because they look at the horse on their left, they look at the one on\ntheir right, and they think, No way am I second to these fuckers.”\nIt began to rain, lightly, a cold winter drizzle. Anden glanced anxiously at\nthe sky and rubbed the outside of his arms, but Hilo stood with his hands in\nhis pockets, elbows jutting loosely forward as he leaned against the\nDuchesse. “Sometimes, Andy, the people you think you can count on, they\nlet you down in a bad way, and that’s hard to take. But for the most part, you\ngive a man something to live up to, you tell him he can be more than he is\nnow, more than other people think he’ll ever be, and he’ll try his godsdamned\nbest to make it true.”\nAnden had the sudden and distinct impression that he was being gently\nchastised for failing today, in his reaction to Lott and the other year-eights. If\nit hadn’t been for his cousin’s appearance, he’d have antagonized the very\nstudents Hilo was depending on to join the ranks of No Peak in the spring.\nAnden dropped his eyes; he understood that he, too, had been given\nsomething to live up to. “You’re right, Hilo-jen.” It wasn’t enough to be a\nGreen Bone, even to be First of Class—he had to be a Kaul.\n“Don’t look like that,” Hilo said. “Like you think I’m disappointed in you\nwhen I’m not. We all have to learn. You stood up to another man and\ndemanded respect for the clan. That shows your heart was in the right place,\nand that’s what matters. Now, let me see the new green you got for being\nFirst of Class.”\nAnden handed his cousin the small green box. Hilo opened it and removed\nthe single round stone, the size of a shirt button and twice as thick, mounted\nwith a simple metal clasp. He held the piece up and studied it. The jade was a\nflawless, vivid, translucent green, edging nearly into blue. Even in the low\nlight at the end of a cloudy day, it seemed almost to glow in Hilo’s fingers.\nThe Pillar made an appreciative noise in his throat, and for an instant, Anden\nfelt an insensible anxiety, a wild, irrational possessiveness, the sudden desire\nto seize back his prize.\nHis cousin smiled as if he could read this instinct in Anden’s face or in his"

He reached out and took Anden’s left wrist. With a deliberateness that\nwas almost tender, he loosened the leather training band and set the fourth\njade stone into a vacant grommet next to the three others. He closed the clasp\nover the leather so it sat snugly against Anden’s skin, then adjusted the\nband’s buckle to fit. “There,” he said, giving his cousin a playful tap across\nthe cheek. “That’s better, isn’t it?”\nAnden closed his eyes for a minute, reveling in the new energy that\nstreamed like light through his tired muscles and frayed nerves. Even with his\neyes closed, he felt as if everything was deliciously clear and heartbreakingly\nbeautiful—the rain striking his skin felt as if it sizzled with sensation, there\nwere a hundred thousand different notes of sound and smell and taste in the\nbreeze, and his cousin’s aura—the shape and place and quality of it—was\nclearer to him than sight. Anden laughed, a little self-conscious at grinning so\nstupidly. He could do Pre-Trials all over again, right now, and do better than\nhe had before, he was sure of it. Every piece of jade gained was like an\nimprovement on the realness of the world, the power he had over his own\nbody and everything around it. He opened his eyes to see Hilo watching him\nwith pride, but also envy. “Do you feel this way every time you get new\njade?” Anden asked.\n“No.” Hilo glanced away. He put an unconscious hand to his chest. “You\nnever forget your first stones—the first six or so. You remember the day you\ngot each one, how you got it, what it felt like, everything. The ones after that\nadd less and less. Every Green Bone levels off at some point. When you’re\ncarrying all the jade you’re meant to carry, adding more doesn’t make a\ndifference. With some people, it goes the other way—it starts ruining them.”\nAnden’s euphoria slid away at Hilo’s words. Ruined. His mother, his\nuncle, now Lan—it seemed wrong, disrespectful, to think of them in that\nway, but what other way was there? Even the wondrous rush of new jade\ncould not suppress the apprehension that rose in Anden—for himself, for\nothers. He could see just a few of Hilo’s jade studs in the space under the\ncollar of his shirt and between the first two buttons, always left undone. But\nhe knew that there was more adorning his cousin’s torso, many dangerous\ntrophies added in the last month alone. “That won’t happen to you, Hilo-jen,\nwill it?” he asked, unable to hide his worry.\nHilo shook his head a little sadly. “I don’t feel anything anymore.”\nCHAPTER\n42\nOld White Rat\nT\nhe back of the Paw-Paw Pawnshop was one of a few places that Tem Ben\ncould be found conducting business with those daring and foolhardy enough\nto be on the bottom rung of the black market jade trade.

It was, Tem thought\nwith satisfaction, a robust industry these days. The Green Bones were busy\nkilling each other with enthusiasm, so criminals of all kinds were enjoying a\nreprieve. There was still the Janloon police to keep an eye out for, but really,\nall they did was fine petty crime, manage traffic, and clean up after the clans.\nThey were civil servants, not fighters. Most possessed no jade at all. Nothing\nlike the beautiful specimen Tem was currently examining under a 10X loupe.\nUnder magnification, it displayed the characteristic uniform interlocking\ngrain pattern that distinguished true Kekonese jade, the rarest, most valuable\ngem in the world, from all other inert green decorative rocks.\nTem frowned to keep his delight hidden from the twitchy Abukei man\nstanding in front of his desk, chewing his bottom lip with crooked teeth\nstained red with betel nut juice. Tem waved a hand to gesture him back from\nblocking the light of the single overhead lamp. The Abukei man had good\nreason to be nervous; the jade he’d brought in was embedded in the hilt of a\nwell-worn talon knife. Lifting a Green Bone’s weapon was a far greater\noffense than river diving—almost certainly fatal if one was caught. This\nshifty, ropy man didn’t look like an experienced or cunning thief. Tem\nsuspected that, like the other cut jade specimens he’d seen lately, this\nparticular piece had been taken from a corpse. Green Bones were diligent\nabout collecting the jade from their fallen enemies, but in a chaotic street war,\nsometimes things were overlooked in haste, weapons were lost, fast\nscavengers could get lucky.\nTem was curious, but his stated policy was no questions asked, and he\nstuck to it. He moved the loupe away and blew out sharply into his thick\nmustache. “There are some imperfections,” he lied. “Forty thousand dien.”\nThe stone was worth twice that much, but the man was eager to get rid of the\nknife, Tem could tell.\n“Is that all?” the man wheedled, clearly suspecting that he was being\ncheated. “I’ve made nearly as much as that for river rocks before. This is a\nreal talon knife.”\n“Jade is more plentiful these days,” Tem said. “Forty thousand.”\nIt was still more money than the man had ever seen. He took the stack of\nbills Tem counted out for him and left, looking unhappy. It wasn’t as if he\nhad much of a choice. With Three-Fingered Gee feeding the worms, and\nLittle Mr. Oh having seen the excellent wisdom of retiring from the business,\na jade thief in these parts would have to trek clear across the city to find\nanother reliable buyer.\nAlone in the pawnshop’s back room, behind the glass cases of watches\nand jewelry and the wall of secondhand televisions and speakers, Tem Ben\ncaressed the hilt of the wickedly sharp talon knife and grinned at his\npurchase. He unwrapped an Ygutanian toffee in celebration.

It was fortunate that Ayt Mada understood the value of stone-eyes\nand rewarded him accordingly. Another year or two of this and he could live\nlike a king in Ygutan. The Pillar had even promised there would be clan work\nand good money for him there once he returned. Of course, his family still\nconsidered him an unspeakable embarrassment, but being filthy rich was the\nbest sort of revenge.\nThe bell over the front door rang as someone entered. The shop was\nclosed to regular business; another jade seller perhaps? Tem leaned over to\nthe peephole in the wall, which gave him clear line of sight to the front of the\nshop. A man in a short tan coat and billed hat stood at the front, barely\nmoving, as if he were listening for something. Casually, he turned around and\nlocked the door with gloved hands.\nIn an instant Tem knew the man was here to kill him. The jade carver slid\nopen his desk drawer and extracted a loaded pistol—a Ankev semiautomatic\nwith enough stopping power to take out an Ygutanian steppe bear—and\npointed it at the entrance of the back room as he dropped the talon knife into\na satchel of rolled money. Quietly, with the bag in one hand and the gun in\nthe other, Tem backed away toward the pawnshop’s back door. He turned the\nknob and pushed. The door held firm. Tem shoved it hard with his shoulder.\nIt budged slightly but stopped again; there was a metallic clanging sound\nfrom some obstacle barring the door from opening.\nFear swept over Tem. He dropped the bag and put his back to the door,\nthe Ankev hefted and ready, waiting for the man to round the corner. If he’s a\nGreen Bone, wait to shoot. Wait until he’s too close to Deflect. Empty the\nwhole magazine. If he avoids the first shot, the others will get him. Steel\nwon’t stop an Ankev. Nothing stops an Ankev, not one man, no matter who he\nis. And Tem was an excellent shot.\nHe couldn’t hear the man’s footsteps. Indeed, the pawnshop was\ndisturbingly quiet. Sweat trickled down the side of Tem’s face, but he didn’t\nmove. He waited. Still, nothing happened. Then suddenly, loud crashing\nerupted from the front of the shop as several heavy things hit the floor. Glass\nshattered. Tem stood rooted; was the man searching for something?\nSearching for jade? Was it his talon knife Tem had in his satchel? The carver\ntook a sideways step toward the peephole and leaned down—\nThe wall next to him exploded in a spray of splinters and plaster. A man’s\nfist punched straight through the thin interior drywall and seized Tem’s wrist\nin a crushing grip of immovable Strength. Too late, Tem realized all the noise\nhad been the sound of the Green Bone clearing the stacks of televisions and\nelectronics from in front of the wall separating them.

The seemingly\ndisembodied arm protruding from the wall gave a violent twist and broke\nTem’s wrist the way one might dislocate a chicken wing joint. The stone-eye\nhowled as the Ankev pistol clattered to the floor.\nThe hand released him. Tem fell back against the desk, holding his limp\nwrist against his chest and scrambling to pick up the fallen pistol with his left\nhand. The wall came apart in a cloud of white dust as the Green Bone\nsmashed a hole large enough to step through. Tem raised the pistol; it shook\nas he tried to steady it with his broken hand. Whimpering with pain, he pulled\nthe trigger. The enormous handgun kicked violently in his weaker grip and\npunched a hole above the back door.\nThe Ankev was yanked from Tem’s hands. The man now holding it\nsquatted down in the small space and brought the butt of the heavy metal\nweapon down twice like a hammer, shattering Tem’s kneecaps. The carver\nscreamed and rolled on the ground in agony. “You shit-licking pig fucker! I’ll\nkill you! I’ll fucking kill you!” he shrieked in Ygut.\nHis tormentor pulled over the desk chair Tem had been in minutes before\nand sat down. He put the Ankev down on the table and took off his cap,\nbeating the plaster flakes from the felt. He brushed at the shoulders of his\njacket, and finding that ineffective, he took the jacket off. After shaking off\nmost of the debris, he laid the jacket over the desk on top of the gun. Then he\nrolled up his sleeves and waited until the stone-eye stopped screaming and\nlay gasping, eyes rolling with hate.\n“You know who I am?”\n“You’re one of those whoreson Maiks,” Tem said.\n“That’s right,” said Maik Tar. “And you’re Tem Ben, better known these\ndays as the Carver.” He pulled a rectangular black object from his jacket\npocket. Tem saw that it was a portable cassette tape recorder, like the sort that\na journalist might carry. Maik wound the tape to the beginning. “You’ve had\na good run,” he said. “Taking out the two other buyers on this side of town—\nthat took some thick blood and style.”\n“I’m a stone-eye,” Tem protested. “The clan let Gee and Mr. Oh run their\nbusinesses for years, and now you’re going to kill a stone-eye over a little\nriver runoff? Where’s your precious Green Bone code of aisho, you cur, you\nfucking louse.”\n“Hey, if you’d stuck to buying river stones, it would’ve been different.\nKaul Lan wouldn’t have sent anyone after you, not a stone-eye, not when it\nmight piss off the Tem family for no real gain. You take a carver off the\nstreets, someone else fills his spot anyway, right?” Maik set the tape recorder\non the corner of the desk. “But now that Lan-jen is dead and we’re at war, it’s\ntime for an overdue chat.

Green Bone code against\nmurdering enemy clan members with no jade didn’t apply to White Rats.\n“My family’s cut me off; I’m not part of the Mountain. You can’t break aisho\non a hunch!” Tem poured sweat.\n“Oh, it’s no hunch, so don’t waste your breath on denials. We’ve had eyes\non you for months. Did you really think you could piss inside No Peak\nterritory and that we wouldn’t smell the stink?” Maik peered inside Tem’s\nsatchel, rummaging through the cash and pulling out the wrapped talon knife\nas if unerringly questing out the nearby jade. He unfolded the cloth and\nwhistled. “Wartime is good for carrion eaters, obviously.” He took the knife\nand tested the edge with his finger, then laid it next to the tape recorder. “This\ncan go the fast way, or the slow way, but in any case, you’re going to tell us\neverything about the Mountain’s activities in No Peak territory, starting with\nwhere you send all the jade you get your hands on. I’ve already got a pretty\ngood inkling, but I want you to tell it for posterity. So be sure to speak\nclearly.” He picked up the tape machine and pressed the record button.\nTem Ben spat. “Tell your master Kaul Hilo to go fuck himself.”\nMaik’s eyes narrowed into slits. He hit pause on the recorder, set it back\ndown on the table, and picked up the talon knife instead. “The slow way it\nis.”\nCHAPTER\n43\nNew White Rat\nA\ns usual, it was past midnight when Shae returned to the Kaul house from\nthe Weather Man’s office. Woon dropped her off at the front, then drove the\ncar around to the garage. He truly was the Weather Man’s Shadow—never\nleaving the tower on Ship Street any earlier than she did, acting as her near-\nconstant bodyguard as well as her Chief of Staff. She’d manipulated him in a\ntime of grief to secure his loyalty but could not regret it, being too grateful\nfor his expertise and the unflagging ethic he now displayed. She wouldn’t\nhave made it through a week as Weather Man without him.\nShae took the front steps slowly and tiredly, feeling, as she had before, a\nmixture of strangeness and homecoming. She’d broken the lease on her one-\nbedroom place and moved into the Kaul house before Hilo even asked her to.\nIt was the only sensible thing to do given the war and her position as Weather\nMan. The Horn could no longer spare the manpower to give special\nprotection to her apartment in North Sotto. The Kaul estate was secure, and\nliving here was the only reliable way of finding the Pillar when she needed\nto.\nSo she’d packed her belongings, told her landlord to keep the furniture for\nthe next tenant, then taken a last walk around the neighborhood. She’d\nbought a meat bun from the corner bakery and lingered to enjoy the smell.\nShe’d admired attractive window displays along the street.

She’d noticed the\nsubtle tension and slightly faster stride of pedestrians as they passed the\nnewspaper stand with headlines about the clan war.\nThen she’d gone back to her apartment one final time and called the\nregional director at Standard & Croft Appliance to explain that, due to family\ncircumstances that would no longer allow her to travel abroad for work, she\nwas regretfully declining his offer of employment.\nShe’d found that apartment herself. She’d gotten that job offer herself.\nThey had been small but deeply personal victories. She hadn’t lived in her\napartment for long, nor had she mustered much excitement for the job, but\nshe felt the loss of both.\nShe couldn’t move into the Weather Man’s house; Doru was still\nimprisoned inside when he wasn’t spending time under guard with her\ngrandfather. She didn’t think she could ever live in that place, unless it was\ntorn down and rebuilt to eliminate any lingering presence of the man. So,\nironically, she was back in her old bedroom. Not that she spent much time in\nit.\nShae paused with her hand on the front door. Stretching out her sense of\nPerception, she could tell that her brother was not home. He had also moved\ninto the main house so the Maiks could live in the Horn’s residence. It felt to\nShae sometimes, when she and Hilo were both present, that they were\nchildren again, sleeping down the hall from each other, passing each other in\nthe kitchen, their auras buzzing up against each other like live wires. Neither\nof them touched Lan’s room.\n“Shae-jen.”\nShae turned to see Maik Wen standing on the driveway behind her. Wen\nwas wearing a fleece robe over a loose shirt and lounge pants, and beach\nsandals on her bare feet. She must’ve hurried down the connecting path when\nshe’d seen Shae’s arrival from the window of the Horn’s house.\n“Wen,” Shae said. “Is something wrong?”\n“No.” The other woman came up to Shae with swift, graceful steps. “I\ncouldn’t sleep and wondered if you’d be kind enough to join me for a cup of\ntea.”\nShae said, “Another time maybe. It’s been a long day, and I don’t think\nI’d be very good company right now.” She turned back to the house.\nWen put a hand on her arm. “Not even for a few minutes? I always see\nyou come home late, then sit in the kitchen with a stack of papers for another\nhour before going to bed. Wouldn’t you like a change of scene, for once? I’ve\nbeen redoing the house and have been desperately wanting to show it to\nanother woman.”\nShae had seen Wen come to the main house. Sometimes she was there\nwaiting for Hilo, sometimes she seemed to be leaving when Shae was\narriving or arriving when Shae was leaving. The two women exchanged nods\nor niceties in the kitchen or the hallway, but hadn’t yet had a conversation of\nmore than twenty words.

She’d squirmed while trying to fall asleep at night,\nstruggling to block out Perception of the blazing energy spill from her\nbrother’s lovemaking down the hall.\nThe idea that Wen paid any attention to Shae’s habits at all surprised her\nenough that she hesitated and turned toward the other woman. Wen took this\nas acquiescence; she gave Shae a warm, enigmatic smile and looped a hand\naround her arm. She seemed a physical sort, just like Hilo—always\nconnecting through touch.\n“Our brothers aren’t home yet. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re having a\ndrink together right now. Why shouldn’t we do the same?” Wen asked.\nShae told herself to be polite. “All right, since you insist.” She let Wen\nwalk her over to the Horn’s residence. They looked odd together: Wen in her\nrobe, feet slapping in her sandals, Shae in conservative business attire, black\npumps crunching on the pebble path through the garden between the houses.\nWen said, conversationally, “This garden’s my favorite part of the entire\ngrounds. It’s so well designed—full of variety but not at all cluttered—and\nthere’s always something blooming no matter the time of year. At night, it\nsmells heavenly. Of course, the houses are impressive, but the garden is\nparticularly beautiful.”\nShae, who’d never paid much attention to the garden, nodded and said,\n“Yes, it’s nice.” Lan had enjoyed it, she knew. She kept walking, allowed the\nthought of her brother to run its familiar, brief course through grief and anger,\nbefore she urged it to dissipate.\nWen glanced at Shae. “I didn’t want to move here at first either. Hilo and\nI had arguments over it. My apartment in Paw-Paw wasn’t much, but I’d set\nit up the way I liked it and I was paying the rent myself every month. To be\nhonest, it was romantic to have Hilo coming to me in my place. I was afraid\nof feeling like an intruder here, worried that the family would look down on\nme.” She straightened slightly, lifted her chin. “But what’s the value of silly\npride compared to doing what’s best for the people one loves? Moving here\nwas the right thing to do. I don’t regret it at all. Though it’d be nice to have\ncompany—everyone is out most of the time.”\nIt was the most Wen had ever said to her, and Shae was surprised by how\npersonal the woman was being, and how perceptively she’d picked up on\nShae’s own reluctance to live on the family estate. She wasn’t sure if Wen\nwas trying to empathize with her or advise her. She decided to respond\nsimply. “I know Hilo appreciates having you here.”\nThey reached the lit front stoop of the Horn’s house. As Wen opened the\ndoor and stepped inside, Shae couldn’t help tugging her right earlobe behind\nthe woman’s back. Stone-eyes weren’t really bad luck, she scolded herself.\nThey were merely genetic recessives, like albinos.

        "text": "They were merely genetic recessives, like albinos. Jade immunity wasn’t a\nkarmic punishment, even if Wen was a bastard, like everyone assumed she\nwas. Nevertheless, the stigma persisted. Shae believed there was a more\nlogical explanation for why Green Bones shunned stone-eyes: No one liked\nto be reminded that jade ability, like life itself, was a crapshoot. It was\npossible to have a Kekonese Green Bone bloodline behind you and still be\nborn no better than an Abukei.\nWen had indeed transformed the house. Shae remembered it had been a\nsour-smelling place with green shag and outdated wallpaper. Hilo’s fiancée\nhad put in bamboo flooring and bright lighting, woven rugs, and new\nfurniture and appliances. The walls had been redone in light colors that made\nthe space seem much larger. Shae could still smell the lingering odor of fresh\npaint mingling with rose oil fragrance. The throw pillows and drapes were\ncolor coordinated in rich burgundy and cream tones. There were decorative\nblack rocks and white silk flowers in a glass dish on the kitchen table. Wen\nwent into the kitchen and started the kettle boiling.\n“I can’t believe it’s the same place.” Shae was genuinely impressed.\n“I can’t believe Hilo lived in it for so long, with it as hideous as it was,”\nWen said. “Now that it’s presentable, he doesn’t even come over because he\nsays it’s Kehn’s house and he doesn’t want to disrespect my older brother.”\nShe measured rolled tea leaves into a pot, then glanced around with a shrug.\n“Kehn and Tar are barely here anyway, and they wouldn’t care if it was a\ncave with straw on the floor.”\nClearly, Wen had put a great deal of time and effort into renovating this\nhouse for no one’s enjoyment but her own, even though she’d be moving out\nof it as soon as she and Hilo were married. Shae’s first, snidely envious\nthought was, She must have a great deal of time on her hands. And then, with\nchagrin, she remembered she’d promised Hilo that she’d find a new, more\nchallenging job for Wen somewhere in the clan. She hadn’t done that. Not\nbeing a high priority, the task had slipped her mind.\nNo doubt Hilo had promised his fiancée it would happen. That must\nexplain Wen’s eagerness to talk to her this evening. Shae sighed inwardly as\nshe took off her shoes and slid onto a bar stool at the kitchen counter. “Hilo\ntold me you’re hoping for a job change. I’ve been meaning to ask around the\nclan to see what’s available. Things have been chaotic, as you know, but I’ll\nget to it this week. Is there anything in particular that you’re looking for? A\nsecretarial position in a different company?”\nTo her surprise, Wen appeared indifferent. “My mother told me that a\nstone-eye needs to have practical, useful skills, like typing. That way, I’ll\nalways be employable.” She warmed the teapot and cups with boiling water,\npoured off the first infusion, then poured again and steeped the tea. “Most\npeople aren’t terribly concerned about bad luck when it comes to low\npositions in the office that don’t involve customers or large sums of money.

I\ncan type a hundred words a minute, you know.” A droll smile lifted the\ncorners of her mouth. She turned to search in the pantry.\n“I take it that’s not what you want to do,” Shae said.\nWen turned back around with a bottle in hand. “Espenian cinnamon\nwhiskey,” she declared. She poured tea into two cups and added a splash of\nliquor into each. “It goes remarkably well with the smoky flavor of this\ngunpowder tea. I wondered if you’d developed a taste for Espenian drinks\nwhile you were there.”\nDirt-cheap keg beer was more the speed with the student population in\nWindton, but Shae nodded her thanks as she took the cup and sipped, finding\nthat Wen had been right about the flavors. What does this woman want from\nme? It was clear Wen had something on her mind; she’d thought about Shae\na lot more than Shae had thought about her. Or was Wen this perspicacious\nwith everyone?\nShe’d never been comfortable with Maik Wen. She could put aside the\nfact that Wen was a stone-eye. More difficult was admitting that she harbored\nlingering resentment that it was acceptable for Hilo to be with a stone-eye\nwoman but intolerable for her to date a foreign man. If anyone had bothered\nto see past Jerald’s Shotarian blood and Espenian uniform, they’d have\nlearned he came from an honorable family. The Maiks, though, had a bad\nreputation.\nThe way Shae had heard it back at the Academy, years ago Wen’s mother\nhad caused a scandal by getting pregnant and running away from her No Peak\nfamily to join her boyfriend in the Mountain clan. Some years later, Maik\nBacu was accused of a grievous offense against the clan and executed. No\none in No Peak was certain what had happened over there, but rumor was that\nhe’d murdered an influential Lantern Man he’d suspected of sleeping with his\nwife. The widow took her two young sons and the daughter in her womb, and\nfled back to her relatives in No Peak, begging them to take her back in. They\ndid so with Kaul Sen’s grudging permission, but the Maik sons were pitied\nand fatherless, and when Wen proved to be a stone-eye, the family’s\ndisrepute was cemented. You can’t trust the Maiks, Shae had overheard her\ngrandfather say. Impulsive and faithless on both sides of the bloodline.\nHilo dismissed all that: “Fatalistic bullshit. No one’s destined to become\ntheir parents.” Befriending and trusting the Maiks when others wouldn’t had\nturned out to be a great boon for Hilo. It frustrated Shae that she could never\ntell if her brother was calculating about these things. Did he think that\nmarrying Wen would cement Kehn’s and Tar’s loyalty? Or had he fallen for\nher without considering any of that?\nShae regarded the other woman. Wen was not exactly beautiful, but Shae\ncould see why Hilo found her alluring.

In conversation, she had a gentle intensity, and\napparently few things escaped her notice.\nWen came around the counter to sit on the bar stool next to Shae.\nTouching Shae’s knee, she asked solemnly, “Shae-jen, you’re the Weather\nMan. What job can you give me that would be the most helpful to the clan\nright now?”\nShae had not been expecting the reversal. She pressed her lips together;\nshe didn’t like being caught by a question she thought she probably ought to\nknow the answer to. “Helpful in what way?” she asked.\n“Helpful to you and Hilo,” Wen said. “Helpful in winning the war.”\nShae swirled the tea in her cup. “The war is between Green Bones.”\n“That’s what Hilo says,” Wen replied. “Though it makes no sense to\nshield me by saying that. If the Mountain wins, they’ll kill my fiancé. My\nbrothers are his Horn and his Pillarman, not to mention the sons of a\nMountain traitor—they’ll die as well. I may be a stone-eye, but I have\neverything to lose in this war, everyone I love.\n“Should I waste the Weather Man’s valuable time by asking her to find\nme an inconsequential job photocopying and typing memos in some minor\nLantern Man’s office?” Wen raised her eyebrows. “Should I take such a job\nhappily?”\nShae thought of other women who’d inhabited the Kaul house—her\ngrandmother, her mother, Lan’s wife Eyni. “You’re going to be the wife of\nthe Pillar,” she said to Wen. “No one expects you to work, much less be part\nof the clan business, especially since you’re a stone-eye.”\n“Expectations are a funny thing,” Wen said. “When you’re born with\nthem, you resent them, fight against them. When you’ve never been given\nany, you feel the lack of them your whole life.” Wen had finished her tea.\nShe took the bottle of whiskey, poured a straight shot into her cup, and tipped\nit back. Shae glimpsed in the single, swift motion a hidden sharpness to Maik\nWen. She realized she did not know the woman at all.\nThe Pillar’s future wife said, “Let me work for you, Shae-jen. On\nsomething that’ll help us win this war.”\n“There are positions in the Weather Man’s office,” Shae said slowly.\n“However, I don’t think you have the educational background I’d need for\nthem …”\n“What’s the most useful role a stone-eye can play in the clan?”\nShae knew the answer; indeed the disquieting thought had already\noccurred to her, but it was a long moment before she met Wen’s eyes and\nreplied. “White Rat.”\nWen said, “Could you use a White Rat, Shae-jen?”\nThe woman was leading her into dangerous territory, Shae could see that\nnow.

Stone-eyes could\nsafely and discreetly handle and transport any amount of jade without\nexuding an aura. Unlike the Abukei, who were suspect and discriminated\nagainst, stone-eyes blended in as ordinary Kekonese civilians. As a White\nRat, a stone-eye could be very useful indeed, as a spy, a smuggler, a\nmessenger, or a thief. Another reason to distrust them.\n“You’re too well known,” Shae said.\n“Only by my name, and only in No Peak. No one in the Mountain knows\nwho I am or would recognize me. They know my brothers, but I don’t look\nlike my brothers.” She was unflinching about her uncertain parentage.\n“Hilo would never allow it.”\n“Never,” Wen agreed. “He couldn’t know. I’d have to have another job as\nwell, a simple one, as cover. I’m sure you could come up with something.”\n“You’re willing to lie to your future husband,” Shae said, not able to mask\nher astonishment. “And you’re asking me, as Weather Man, to go against the\nwishes of the Pillar. I’d be putting you in danger if I did this. Aisho would no\nlonger protect you.”\nRemorse gathered in Wen’s full lips and dark eyes. “Shae-jen, did you\nbecome Weather Man to please the Pillar, or to save the clan?” She smiled\nsadly to say she knew the answer and turned her face away, her voice falling\nslightly. “Hilo’s brilliant as Horn. He’s honest and fierce, and his men revere\nhim. If heart alone could win the war, we’d already be victorious. But he was\nnever meant to be Pillar. He’s not farsighted or politically shrewd, and all the\njade in the world won’t change that.”\nShe turned back to Shae, who sat nonplussed by Wen’s flat assessment.\n“He knows he needs your help. If I can be of use to you as a White Rat, I’ll\nbe doing everything I can to help the family survive. He insists he loves me\ntoo much to let me get involved in the war in any way … and I love him too\nmuch to obey.”\nIt must’ve been at least one o’clock in the morning, but Shae was wide\nawake and her mind had begun chewing at fearful possibilities. She looked\naround the renovated surroundings again, slowly. It had taken Wen a few\nweeks to completely change the house, to put together a skillful artifice of\nsights, smells, and textures, all working together to create a pleasing, polished\nappearance for the formerly ugly but honest residence of No Peak’s most\nsavage men. She realized now that she had misjudged Maik Wen, had seen\nher warm, pliable, sensual demeanor and overlooked the Green Bone core\nbeneath the stone-eye stigma, forgotten that she was sister to the ferocious\nMaik brothers. She’d resented Wen before; now she was uneasy.\nShe thought, Two strong-minded women in a man’s world, if they do not\nquickly become allies, are destined to be incurable rivals.

We’ll talk again\nsoon.” She made her way to the door and put on her shoes. The delicate\nfragrance of winter-flowering plum blossom swept in from the garden when\nshe opened the door. She paused in the doorway, turning back for a second as\nthe light in the hall elongated her shadow across the stoop of the Horn’s\nhouse. “I think,” she ventured, “that it’s possible my brother has better taste\nthan I’ve given him credit for.”\nWen smiled. “Good night, sister.”\nCHAPTER\n44\nReturn to the Goody Too\nB\nero thought about the tunnel beneath the Goody Too. He thought about it a\nlot, and whenever he thought about it, he was filled with bitter rage. Janloon\nwas at war over the death of Kaul Lan—his doing!—and there was jade being\nwon and lost on the streets every day, but Bero was nowhere nearer to a\nsingle pebble of it for himself. Instead, he’d been forced to flee and hide, like\na roach before a bright light.\nHe hadn’t fled far. After stumbling through the darkness for what felt like\nan eternity, wondering with each step when his flashlight batteries would run\nout and leave him to wander blind until he collapsed and died, Bero had felt a\nbreeze on his face. A faint air current pungent with the smell of the harbor—\nsea salt and boat fumes, fish and wet garbage. The breeze preceded a distant\ncircle of evening light, which Bero ran toward as if running toward his own\ndead mother. As Mudt had promised, the tunnel let out under an escarpment\nnear the wharfs of Summer Park. In heavy spring rains or a summer typhoon,\nthe tunnel would flood, but in the dry winter season it was an excellent\nsmugglers passage. Dirty and exhausted, Bero paid for passage on a small\nprivate ferry, but he did not take Mudt’s advice to flee far from Janloon.\nFor weeks, he’d laid low on Little Button. The island was only forty-five\nminutes away by ferry boat, and it wasn’t officially part of Janloon, though\non a clear day Bero could see the city from across the strait. Little Button was\nits own municipality. For centuries, there’d been a Deitist monastery here,\nbefore the Shotarians had turned it into a labor camp, and now it was a\ntouristy sort of place with a restored Deitist temple, a nature preserve, and a\nquaint town full of little shops selling overpriced knickknacks and handmade\nitems.

Full of Janloon day-\ntrippers and foreign visitors, it was easy enough to get a motel room and\nnurse the injuries to his body and his pride in glum solitude, watching\ntelevision, eating takeout food, and plotting his return to the city. Little\nButton was run by a minor family clan that was a tributary of the Mountain,\nbut from what Bero gathered, it was largely left alone by the Janloon clans.\nJust to be safe, he moved to a new motel every week, so no one would start\nnoticing him.\nFrom the news, Bero knew that the city was a patchwork of street\nviolence and there were parts of Janloon where it wasn’t clear which clan was\nin charge, if any. The Mountain had taken a good chunk of the Docks, but No\nPeak still held the Armpit and had conquered much of Sogen. Fishtown was\nanyone’s guess. Bero had been gone for more than a month. In all this chaos,\nsurely no one was still looking for him. On a clear morning, he went down to\nthe marina and took the ferry back across the strait.\nBero blamed Mudt and the goateed Green Bone for his situation. They’d\nset him up. They’d promised him jade and then reneged on him. They’d\nnever intended to bring him in. The more Bero thought about it, the angrier\nhe grew. Also, he thought about the tunnel under Mudt’s store and the hidden\nboxes he’d been too hurried and panicked to inspect or steal. Again, he\nkicked himself. All his misfortunes came from haste. What was in those\nboxes?\nHe knew where to get the jade that was rightfully his: from Mudt himself.\nHe didn’t have the Fullerton anymore, which was a shame, but he had plenty\nof money, and although civilian ownership of handguns was technically\nillegal in Janloon, conditions of disorder in a clan war ensured that the street\nsale of them was common. It took Bero one afternoon in the Mountain-\ncontrolled side of the Docks to get his hands on a decent revolver. His plan\nwas to hold Mudt’s son hostage at gunpoint until Mudt paid with his jade. If\nthat didn’t work, he would kill Mudt and take the jade.\nAn unexpected sight met his eyes when he got to the Goody Too that\nevening. The store was dark and the building was boarded up. The store’s\nlarge banner had been torn down, and there was no sign of anyone in or\naround the place. Bero wandered up to the window suspiciously and peered\nthrough. It was a mess inside. The place had been ransacked. Shelves were\nempty and fixtures were tipped over. Most of the merchandise was gone, but\nwhat remained was scattered on the ground and already picked through—\nuseless stuff like old magazines and sun hats.\nBero kicked the front door and jiggled the padlock angrily. He looked\naround. The street was empty. This part of town was so close to the border\nbetween Junko and Spearpoint that apparently no one in their right mind\nwanted to be loitering in it.

A homeless man on the corner, the only other person in\nsight on what was typically a busy intersection, called out, “Haven’t you\nheard? Mudt’s dead, keke!”\nBero turned around. “Dead? Who killed him?”\nThe man grinned a toothless grin from under his blankets. He shrugged\nand giggled. “He did! Walking around with jade, you’re killing yourself!”\nBero found a heavy rock and broke one of the Goody Too’s windows. It\nmade a gods-awful amount of racket, but there was no one but the hobo\nnearby to take notice. As Bero kicked in the glass and climbed gingerly into\nthe ruined store, he was fuming with a peculiar mixture of disappointment\nand hope. So Mudt was gone, and his jade with him. Someone had beaten\nBero to it. That was just to be expected, wasn’t it? Always, something would\nhappen; fate would shine on him, it would dangle what he desired, then it\nwould snatch it away. Lucky and unlucky, that was him. And now, maybe\nbad luck would turn to good again. Maybe. Maybe.\nThe closet in the back of the store was open. The drawers of the wheeled\nfiling cabinet were open and the contents pulled out and dumped in the mad\nsearch for cash and valuables, but the thing itself hadn’t been moved. His\nheart in his throat, Bero leaned his weight against it and pushed it out of the\nway. He felt around in the dark to find the break in the carpet. When he rolled\nit back, he found the trapdoor he’d escaped through five weeks ago.\nBero closed the door of the closet and blocked it with the filing cabinet.\nHe pulled the chain of the single bulb overhead, flooding the small space\nwith yellowish light. Bero tugged at the metal ring of the trapdoor; it lifted\nwith a heavy scraping sound and a small cloud of dust. Queasy with\nanticipation, he descended warily down the steps into the tunnel.\nIt was still there, boxes and crates, untouched by the scavengers who’d\ntorn through the rest of the store. Bero took one of the top boxes and set it on\nthe steps. He cut the packing tape with a pocketknife and gaped at what he’d\nfound.\nThen he stared back at the small tower of containers. How had Mudt\nhoarded all this? Surely it hadn’t all come from the goateed Green Bone,\nwho’d only brought him the one small box that first night Bero had seen him.\nMudt must’ve been a dealer. A grin spread across Bero’s face as he pulled\none of the small sealed bottles out of the open carton in front of him.\nShine. A lifetime supply of shine. All of it, now his.\nHis hands shaking with eagerness, Bero scooped up as many vials as he\ncould fit into his pockets. Then he replaced the half-empty box on top of the\nothers, and with an avaricious backward glance, climbed back out of the\ntunnel into the store. He dropped the trapdoor into place, rolled the carpet\nover it, and moved the filing cabinet back to exactly where it had been over\nthe entrance to the secret tunnel.

Bero turned out the closet light and stepped\nback out into the demolished store, his pockets laden and his mind galloping.\nThis building would probably be taken over by someone else soon. He would\nhave to move his treasure trove to somewhere safe that he could more easily\naccess …\nA noise behind him and a flashlight beam falling across his shoulders\nmade Bero jump and whirl in the dark. He scrabbled for his revolver and\nbrought it up into the face of a boy, thirteen or fourteen years old. Mudt’s\nson.\n“What are you doing here?” Bero shouted.\n“I thought you might be him, coming back for me.” The boy’s voice was\nhigh and strained. He held a cheap, folding talon knife in his fist; his\nknuckles were white on the handle. The flashlight beam stayed on Bero as the\ntwo of them stared at each other.\n“Who’s coming back for you?” Bero’s finger hugged the trigger of the\nrevolver. He didn’t want this kid telling anyone he was back in the city, or\ngetting the idea that his dead father’s store of shine belonged to him instead\nof Bero.\nThe junior Mudt trembled, shaking the weak flashlight beam, but there\nwas wild hatred in his voice as he spat, “Maik. He killed my da. Maik Tar\nkilled my da, and if it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to kill him!” Tears\nsprang into his eyes.\nBero’s finger was still curled, but now he hesitated. Slowly, he lowered\nthe revolver. “It’s hard to kill a really powerful Green Bone,” he said.\n“I don’t care; I’ll do whatever it takes!” Both the flashlight and the talon\nknife dropped to the teenager’s side and he stood nearly panting, glaring at\nBero with flushed cheeks and maddened eyes, as if daring him to say\notherwise.\n“I’ve done it before,” Bero told him with a thrill of pride. “I’ve killed a\nGreen Bone. No one figured I could do it, but they were wrong, all of them.”\nThe other teen’s eyes widened with greedy curiosity. Whenever he’d seen\nthe younger Mudt before, Bero had paid him little attention. He’d always\nseemed obedient and unremarkable. He was skinny and his hair was greasy\nand his face had a ratlike quality. But he wasn’t as much of a pussy as either\nSampa or Cheeky had been.\nIt wasn’t good to do things alone, Bero decided. Fate was like a tiger\nencountered on the road; best to divide its attention. When things had gone\nmost wrong for Bero, someone smaller and weaker had always been there to\ndraw the bad luck to themselves.\n“I’m not scared of Green Bones,” Bero said. “They’re the ones who are\nscared of us, you know. They killed your da because they’re afraid of people\noutside the clan having jade. What we need is some jade of our own, keke.”\n“Yeah,” said Mudt fiercely. “Yeah, that’s right.”\n“And I know where to get it.”\nMudt’s flashlight beam came back up. “You do?”\nCHAPTER\n45\nA Shared Joke\nH"

The guard was a young woman\nwhose jade aura hummed with intense concentration as Hilo approached. The\nmembers of Haedo Shield were purportedly trained to an especially high\nlevel of Perception to detect signs of murderous intent. She would have to\nrelax her standards for Perceived hostility if she was going to let anyone into\nthe building today, Hilo thought, smiling to himself as he unstrapped his\nmoon blade, unbuckled his talon knife, and unholstered his gun, placing them\nside by side on the table in front of the metal detector. It wasn’t that he\ndoubted the guard’s abilities or didn’t understand the sentiment behind\nleaving weapons outside the negotiating chamber, but both were pointless\nmeasures. There was plenty of jade being collectively carried into the room\non people’s bodies. The Green Bones in attendance could easily kill each\nother bare-handed if negotiations broke down.\nThey would not, though, not with a penitent in the room, and there were\nthree of them present in the meeting chamber where the mediation between\nthe clan leaders was scheduled to take place. Apparently the council thought\nit wise to arrange triple the spiritual insurance. The penitents stood quietly in\nthe corners of the room, one man and two women, their shaved heads bowed\nand hands folded in the sleeves of their long green robes. Acts of violence\nwere forbidden not just in any Deitist temple but anywhere a penitent was\npresent. They were in direct communication with Heaven, so the belief went;\nthe gods would know who had gone against the Divine Virtues and struck\nfirst. Heaven’s spies, as it were. Not only would the sinner’s soul be damned,\nbut on the day of the Return, his entire family line—ancestors, parents,\nchildren, and descendants—would be refused entry into Heaven and be\nforced to wander the empty earth in exile for all eternity.\nYesterday, Hilo had suggested to Shae that it would be worth risking\nwhatever theoretical metaphysical reckoning would befall them in the\nafterlife, if the two of them could kill Ayt Mada right where she sat across the\ntable from them.\nShae had turned a stunningly cold look on him. “The gods are cruel,\nHilo,” she said, as if she knew them personally. “Don’t tempt them with\narrogance.”\nThere were two doors in the chamber, so he and Ayt did not even enter\nthrough the same hallway. Hilo went into the room and sat down in the end\nchair, nodding to the dozen members of the Royal Council who lined either\nside of the table and comprised the official mediation committee. They\nlooked officious in dark suits and held expensive pens over yellow legal pads\nin leather folios.\nFour of the committee members belonged to No Peak—stern-looking Mr.\nVang, white-haired Mr. Loyi, horse-faced Mrs. Nurh, and smiley Mr. Kowi\nwho had a head shaped like a turnip. Hilo recognized each of them on\naccount of Woon’s briefing the previous evening. The diligent former\nPillarman was proving to be a great asset in the Weather Man’s office. Hilo"

        "text": "account of Woon’s briefing the previous evening. The diligent former\nPillarman was proving to be a great asset in the Weather Man’s office. Hilo\nwas glad to have spared his life. He did not blame Woon for Lan’s death, no\nmore than he blamed himself, but it was good to see the man turn his remorse\ninto effort for the clan.\nOf the other politicians in the room, four were loyal to the Mountain. The\nremaining four were not clan affiliated. Hilo hadn’t even known there were\ncouncilmen who had no clan allegiance, ones who might be bought. “There\nare fourteen independents, plus two beholden to minor clans, out of three\nhundred,” Shae had enlightened him. “Try to remember these things.”\nThe seat at the other end of the table was empty. Ayt had not arrived yet.\nHilo checked his watch. He leaned back in his chair and smiled at those\nassembled, apparently at ease as he waited. “Ayt-jen must’ve stopped to key\nmy car.”\nA nervous chuckling from some around the table. Mr. Loyi half smiled\nand Mr. Kowi laughed out loud, but Vang and Nurh looked unimpressed.\nMost of the people in the room, regardless of clan, regarded Hilo with a\nmixture of nervous respect and cloaked disdain; they didn’t know what to\nmake of the wolfish young Pillar. Hilo didn’t particularly care for them\neither. Puppets behind puppets.\nIn the seat slightly behind and to the left of him, Shae’s aura grew a little\nlouder in his mind, and she rapped a pen on the arm of her chair, as if in a\nwarning reminder that they were here to improve their standing with the\ncouncil, not worsen it.\nSilence descended abruptly over the room. The politicians that had been\nchatting quietly noticed and straightened back to the table expectantly. It took\nHilo a second to realize that the change was in reaction to him. He had gone\nentirely still, his gaze resting unfocused on some middle distance as his\nPerception stretched beyond the walls. Ayt Mada and her Weather Man had\nentered the building and were making their way toward the room. His\nenemy’s jade aura was dark, dense, and molten, like lava flowing inexorably\ncloser, building in heat. It exuded a calm, unrelenting malice directed\nunmistakably at him, and as she could no doubt Perceive him where he sat,\nthe intensity of their long psychic stare was such that Hilo felt there was\nalmost nothing left to say by the time Ayt entered the room a minute later.\nEverything that was going to happen today had already happened. The rest\nwould be meaningless talk.\nAs he had expected, Ayt’s physical appearance was of little note in\ncomparison to the impression left by her aura. She was dressed in black, with\na cream-colored blazer, and wore no handbag, jewelry, or makeup. She strode\nin, appeared faintly amused by the waiting crowd, and settled into the chair\nopposite Hilo at the other end of the table. Short, slick-haired Ree Tura took\nthe seat behind her left shoulder.\n“Good afternoon, councilmen,” Ayt said.\n“Ayt-jen.” The politicians beholden to the Mountain nodded in her"

They paid her respect, that much was clear, more than the No Peak\ncouncilmen paid to Hilo, whose lips twitched slightly, his eyes still fixed on\nthe other Pillar. With Ayt’s entry, the room changed. Where there had been\nbusinesslike anticipation, now there was a tension preceding something\ninevitable. The air held the quality of a taut bowstring, of the blade before it\nfalls, of the space between hammer and pin. Even the suits in the room with\nno ability in Perception sensed it easily enough.\nThe chair of the committee, a woman named Onde Pattanya who was one\nof the few independent council members, was brave enough to stand up and\nstart the meeting. She cleared her throat. “Respected Green Bones and fellow\nmembers of the Royal Council, we meet in Wisdom Hall today, in good faith\nand in the spirit of the Divine Virtues, under the watchful eye of the gods”—\nshe glanced meaningfully at the penitents in the corners—“and under the\nauspices of His Heavenship, Prince Ioan III.” She inclined herself toward the\nportrait of the sovereign on the wall.\n“May he live three hundred years,” the room murmured in dutiful chorus.\nHilo quelled a smirk as he glanced at the oil painting on the wall. It\ndepicted a stately, heavy-browed young man in the traditional long-robed\ngarb of Kekonese nobility, sitting on a wide, cushioned chair with one hand\nresting on the sheathed moon blade across his lap and the other holding a fan\nof palm fronds, representing the monarch’s role as warrior and peacemaker.\nIt was an archaic symbolism. The moon blade was traditionally a Green\nBone weapon; Hilo was quite certain the prince had never drawn a real one.\nMembers of the Kekonese royal family were forbidden from wearing jade, an\nedict codified in the national constitution after the throne was reestablished\nfollowing the Many Nations War and independence from the Empire of\nShotar. Hilo had seen the prince, who was considerably less majestic in real\nlife, during public festivities at New Year’s and other major holidays, and\nthere was a large, framed photograph in the Kaul house of the monarch\nbestowing Hilo’s grandfather with some royal honor for national service.\nPrince Ioan III was popular as a symbol of Kekon’s unity and history, but he\nwas a figurehead, a man who lived a comfortable, state-funded life of\nceremonial duties. His splendid portrait was in the room, but he was not. He\nmerely gave his blessing to the Royal Council, which represented the people\nand passed the laws. Ninety-five percent of the council members held clan\naffiliation and were funded by powerful Lantern Men, who were themselves\ntributaries of the clans. Real power in Janloon, and by extension the entire\ncountry, rested in the clans, in the two Pillars whose hatred for each other\npervaded the length of the room like a pungent odor.\n“Let me begin,” said Councilwoman Onde, “by applauding Ayt-jen and\nKaul-jen and their Weather Men for taking the important step of being here,"

        "text": "“Let me begin,” said Councilwoman Onde, “by applauding Ayt-jen and\nKaul-jen and their Weather Men for taking the important step of being here,\nand signaling their willingness to resolve differences through negotiation\ninstead of violence. I speak on behalf of the entire Royal Council in\nexpressing my sincere hope that we will soon reach an agreement that will\nreturn our city to a state of peace. We are scheduled to meet here for five\ndays, but all of us on the committee are committed to staying as long as\nnecessary to assist in reaching an agreeable outcome. Of course,” Onde put in\nwith an optimistic smile, “if we conclude early, all’s the better.”\nHilo thought glumly about all the time that would be wasted—time in\nwhich he was kept away from the critical battles that were being fought\nthroughout the city. While he was in here, Kehn was in sole command of the\nwar, and while Hilo had faith in his Horn, he would be deluding himself not\nto admit that Gont outclassed the Maiks as a strategist and fighter. Ayt could\nafford to sit here; Hilo could not.\n“We’ll begin with an opening statement from each side,” said Onde. “By\ncoin toss, the Mountain will proceed first. Ayt-jen.” She sat down and picked\nup her pen.\nAyt let a pause settle, just short of uncomfortable, before she said, in a\nclear, even voice that reminded Hilo of an Academy lecturer, “I’m deeply\nsaddened that the rift between the two great clans of this country has led to\nbloodshed. However, my father—let the gods recognize him—impressed\nupon me the responsibility that Green Bones hold, to protect and defend the\ncommon people. When those who depend on us for protection are threatened,\nwe have no choice but to respond.”\nShe held a hand out to her Weather Man, who immediately placed a sheet\nof paper in it. “For some time now, No Peak’s overly aggressive tactics have\nharmed respectable citizens and businesses. For the enlightenment of the\ncommittee, Ree-jen has listed merely a few examples.” Ayt glanced at the\npaper in her hand. “Construction on the Reign of Luck Casino was delayed\nfor three months due to sabotage, which was explicitly ordered by the Horn\nof No Peak at the time …”\nHilo listened silently to Ayt’s extended list of grievances. He kept his\nexpression mild and unchanged, but impatience and anger built inside him.\nHe could reply to every single one of the accusations. Yes, he’d ordered his\nFists to disrupt the construction of the Reign of Luck Casino, but only\nbecause the building contract had been outright stolen from No Peak. Yes,\nhe’d allowed his men to cripple those three Mountain Fingers—because\nthey’d vandalized and terrorized a string of No Peak properties. Ayt went on\nwith an accounting of old sore spots, some stretching back two years or more,\nnone of them material to the war now.\nWhen Ayt finished, Councilwoman Onde thanked her and reminded\neveryone there ought to be no discussion until No Peak had had a chance to\nrespond. Onde turned to Hilo and asked if he was ready to make his opening\nstatement. For a moment, Hilo considered declining the invitation and\nleaving the circus before it could continue, but Shae loudly rustled the paper"

        "text": "statement. For a moment, Hilo considered declining the invitation and\nleaving the circus before it could continue, but Shae loudly rustled the paper\nshe reached forward to place on the table beside him. Hilo glanced down at it.\nThe Weather Man and her Shadow had prepared different speeches\ndepending on what strategy Ayt employed—whether she began with grand\nstatements, specific demands, or vague accusations. Hilo picked up the paper.\n“I’d like to applaud and thank the Royal Council for recognizing the need\nfor this meeting. As active citizens and members of the community, we\nGreen Bones want peace and prosperity for Janloon as much as anyone else.”\nThe words sounded stilted and unnatural in his mouth, and he skipped over\nsome of the speech. Does Shae really expect me to say all this? He continued\nreading, reciting a list of No Peak’s opening demands of the Mountain:\nwithdrawal from the Docks, surrender of the Armpit, cessation of SN1\nproduction, and consent to being subject to an outside inspection of financial\nrecords and jade inventories. The last one was so outrageous that Hilo had to\nfight a smile at Ree Tura’s look of outrage, though Ayt herself seemed\nunsurprised and didn’t react.\n“Thank you, Kaul-jen,” said Councilwoman Onde. “I am encouraged by\nthe clarity and forthrightness expressed by both Pillars in their opening\nstatements. A solid basis upon which to build our discussion.” Onde was\nlikely one of the only individuals in the room to think this could be true. The\nclan-affiliated politicians on both sides of the table appeared more nervous\nafter hearing the superficiality of the speeches, sensing it to be a sign that\ntheir Pillars had already come to an understanding without words. “As the\nissue of territorial jurisdiction is the most pressing in terms of contributing to\nthe ongoing street violence, I suggest we begin there,” Onde said brightly.\nAfter several hours, Ayt made a show of conceding that the Mountain\nwould hold its position south of the General’s Ride and not press further into\nthe Docks or the Junko district. In exchange, Hilo stated to the council that\nthere would be no further attacks on Fishtown or Spearpoint. Meaningless\nagreements. The Mountain couldn’t push further into the Docks; Hilo knew\nthey didn’t have the manpower. Just like he knew No Peak couldn’t hold\nFishtown or Spearpoint, even if he went after them. Neither district was\nparticularly valuable anyway. The Armpit and Sogen were the worst\nbattlegrounds, and there’d been no movement toward agreement in either.\nKehn was installed with eighty warriors in Sogen right now.\nTellingly, no mention had been made by either side of the assassination\nattempt on Hilo, the murder of Lan, or the massacre of twenty-one Mountain\nGreen Bones on Poor Man’s Road. A room in Wisdom Hall was not where\nthose grievances would be accounted for. Hilo stared across at Ayt as they\nboth stood up to leave. This is a joke. A joke we’re sharing.\nThe second day of negotiations did not progress much further than the first.\nDuring one of the fifteen-minute breaks, Hilo took his Weather Man aside.\n“This is an orgy of pigs in shit,” he said. “A complete fucking waste of time.”\n“If we walk out now, it’ll look like we broke off negotiations and No Peak"

In their minds, that settles the blood score between the clans and we\nought to talk the rest of it out and get back to life as normal.” She cut him off\nbefore he could reply with any derisive exclamations. “Remember why we’re\nhere. We need to show the Lantern Men and the Royal Council that we made\nan effort at peace. The way Ayt is stonewalling, we’ll have their sympathies\nwhen we lay everything out on the last day.”\nShae had obtained early results of the formal audit on the KJA, and she\nplanned, on the fifth and final day, to use them as leverage against the\nMountain, and failing that, to disclose them and make it clear to the council\nthat the war was about far more than clan vendettas, that the Mountain’s\nactions went against Kekonese law and values. Hilo admitted that it was not a\nbad plan. Either they would come away with enough concessions to put them\nin a tenable military position until spring, or they would hold the moral high\nground and thus, hopefully, the support of the clan’s Lantern Men and the\npublic. Nevertheless, Hilo felt all these things were ancillary factors; they\nwould not substantially change the outcome of the war, and he chafed at the\ntask of playing through this farce for the benefit of the spectators.\nHe returned to his place in the room. It was growing increasingly\ninfuriating to Perceive the smugness of his opponent’s thick jade aura, to\ncatch the occasional twitch of amusement on her lips. They were in on this\ntogether, the placating and assuaging of the politicians and the businessmen,\nthe self-importantly modern Kekonese who liked to tell themselves that there\nwas no need to solve disputes in the old way, the way of the clean blade\nunder the judgment of Old Uncle. A belief both Pillars knew to be falsehood.\nAyt was playing her part more willingly than Hilo, however, because she\nwas good at it. Far better than him, a fact she lorded over him with every\nword and gesture. She’d been Weather Man before she’d become Pillar and\nknew how to come across as a seasoned and articulate businesswoman. She\nwas using that advantage now, to taunt and provoke him, to make him seem\nlike nothing but a young hoodlum. The contrast between them made these\njadeless stooges forget that Ayt Mada was the most powerful Pillar on Kekon\non account of having killed her father’s Horn, his First and Second Fists, his\nPillarman, and his youngest son. At times, the thought made Hilo chuckle.\nThe second day ended with so little change from the previous that even\nthe relentless Onde seemed discouraged. Hilo was impatient to get to a\nphone, to find out if one of his Fists, Goun Jeru, who’d been ambushed and\nbadly injured just before dawn, had survived the surgery room. He and Shae"

He and Shae\nsaid little to each other, parting ways outside of Wisdom Hall. Shae stepped\ninto a car waiting to take her back to the Weather Man’s office on Ship\nStreet. Hilo found it amusing that for someone who had put on such a show\nof eschewing clan trappings back when she’d first returned to Janloon, his\nWeather Man seemed to harbor no qualms about wielding them now. Which\nmerely proved to Hilo that his sister had been fooling herself the whole time\nand ought to have known better, ought to have come around before she’d\nbeen forced.\nHilo looked for his driver and the Duchesse in front of the reflecting pool\nbut instead saw Maik Tar waiting in one of the clan’s nondescript cars. When\nhe got into the passenger seat, Tar turned down the radio and offered him a\ncigarette. Hilo noticed that the Pillarman’s sleeve was speckled with dried\nblood; his eyes were ringed from lack of sleep but gleamed with a triumph\nthat made the texture of his aura scratchy with repressed excitement. “How’d\nit go?” Tar asked. “Same as before?”\n“Worse. A shame the penitents are still there.”\n“You could bring me in,” offered Tar. “I’m not going to Heaven anyway.”\n“How’s Goun?” The unhappy shift in Tar’s aura answered him\nimmediately. “Fuck,” Hilo said quietly. Goun had been a classmate of his, a\nskilled fighter but also a funny man who put people in a good mood and\ncould always tell a story. Hilo ought to have seen him before he died, ought\nto have gone in person to break the news to his parents and sister. Instead,\nhe’d been mincing words and pandering pointlessly in Wisdom Hall.\nA wave of rage boiled up Hilo’s neck and into his face. “Fuck! Fuck the\ngods! Fuck Ayt and fuck Gont with a sharp stick, fuck them.” He slammed\nhis head against the headrest and punched the ceiling of the car, denting it.\nTar dangled his cigarette out the open window and waited until his Pillar\nhad calmed down. “Let the gods recognize him, poor bastard,” he said at last.\n“Let the gods recognize him,” Hilo agreed in a deadened voice.\n“It’s not all bad news, though,” Tar said, and waited with some obvious\nsmugness for Hilo to ask him what redeeming thing it was he’d made a point\nto come in person to share. Tar was like a kid sometimes, eager to please,\nprone to both tantrums and overexcitement, possessing a curious combination\nof boldness and insecurity. Ever since he’d gotten out of the hospital, he’d\nseemed desperate for a chance to prove himself and displace the\nembarrassment of his injury. Redesigning the Pillarman’s role for Tar was a\nstroke of personnel genius that Hilo was quite proud of.\nStill, as he was in an awful mood over losing Goun, Hilo did not at once\nindulge the man’s eagerness.

Goun had\nbeen his classmate too, but Tar seemed only mildly bothered by his death. He\ncared for only a few people in the world, though these people could ask\nanything of him.\nHilo gave in. “What’s giving you such a hard on, that you have to tell\nme?”\nAfter Tar had explained everything, Hilo stared out the window, his\nburning gaze resting unfocused on some middle distance as the fingers of his\nright hand drummed lightly and rapidly on one knee. “Drive,” he told Tar.\n“Let me think about this.” After a while longer, he declared, “Tomorrow’s\ngoing to be different. A lot different. You did good, Tar,” and his Pillarman\nsmiled in satisfaction at the praise, touching the new talon knife on his belt.\nCHAPTER\n46\nHonest Talk\nO\nn the morning of the third day of mediation, Hilo arrived early at Wisdom\nHall with Shae to meet with Chancellor Son Tomarho, who had been\nrequesting a meeting with the Pillar for some time, with increasing pique.\n“Kaul-jen, come in. How’re the gods favoring you?” Son asked, ushering\nthem into the office.\n“With their usual sadistic sense of humor,” Hilo said. “You?”\nThe politician appeared to stifle an involuntary reaction to Hilo’s casual\nblasphemy by lowering his ruddy face beneath a stiff and shallow salute.\n“Ah. Well. Well enough, thank you.” Hilo was under the distinct impression\nthat Chancellor Son Tomarho did not like him. A year ago, he’d refused\nSon’s request that he break up the workers’ strike on the Docks by force, and\nat Lan’s funeral, the man had shown only the minimum of respect to the new\nPillar. The fact that Hilo had now ignored him for several weeks while he\nconcentrated on the war could only have exacerbated the man’s dislike.\nIndeed, the way Son was looking at him now, with an obviously forced smile\nthat did not hide the coldness of his scrutinizing gaze, confirmed what Hilo\nsuspected: The chancellor saw himself as a man of political refinement and\ndistinction, someone existing above the unfortunate but occasionally\nnecessary savagery of certain parts of the clan. Son looked at Hilo and saw\nyouth and muscle—someone who ought to be taking orders, not giving them,\nand certainly not attending Wisdom Hall as Pillar.\nIt was difficult for Hilo to behave in a rational and civil manner toward\npeople with whom he did not share any personal warmth. Their status or\nimportance in the eyes of others had little bearing on him. He knew this was a\nweakness on his part; indeed, placing personal feelings over more politic\nconsiderations had led him into trouble before and earned him his\ngrandfather’s ire.

        "text": "weakness on his part; indeed, placing personal feelings over more politic\nconsiderations had led him into trouble before and earned him his\ngrandfather’s ire. When Hilo and his siblings were children, Kaul Sen had\nbeaten Lan infrequently and Shae not at all, but his middle grandchild had\nbeen whipped for causing trouble with instructors at the Academy, for\nbreaking the arm of the son of one of his grandfather’s own business partners,\nfor being seen around the city everywhere with the Maik boys.\nDoing his best to quell both an instinctive resentment toward Son and a\nsense of general discomfort with the pompous formality of the oak-paneled\noffice, Hilo let himself be gestured into the seat across from the chancellor’s\nwide desk. Shae positioned her chair slightly behind and to the left of his. He\nwas glad she was present because she appeared more at ease than he felt. The\nchancellor sat and motioned to his aide to bring refreshments, then turned to\nHilo with that same painted-on smile.\nHilo said, “Well, I’m here. What do you want to talk about?”\nSon’s smile wavered visibly. “Kaul-jen,” he said, recovering it with\nadmirable speed, “I appreciate that you’re a very busy man. Leading the clan\nas Pillar in this time of difficulty is no doubt all-consuming. I dare say as\nmuch work as running a country.” The rebuke was delivered with a casual\nthrust, but it was clear nevertheless. Son was the functional head of the\ngovernment and not pleased with having been kept waiting by a twenty-eight-\nyear-old street fighter who’d come into the clan’s leadership unintended.\nHilo replied with a casual jab of his own. “I hope none of your political\nopponents are trying to take your head off with a moon blade.” He nodded in\nthanks at the aide who put a cold glass of anise-scented tea in front of him.\nTrying hard to bear in mind what Shae had told him about the importance of\nthe Royal Council and the clan’s need for political support and legitimacy,\nHilo changed his tone and said more seriously, “I’ll admit I have a lot to learn\nabout being the Pillar. My brother—let the gods recognize him—didn’t have\na chance to prepare me for it. Our enemies saw to that, and I haven’t been off\nmy feet since. I apologize if I’ve been disrespectful by not meeting with you\nsooner.”\nHilo’s sincerity seemed to appease Son somewhat. “Well, the most\nimportant thing is that you’ve been sitting down with Ayt Mada and the\ncouncil’s mediation committee. As chancellor, I couldn’t be part of the\ncommittee myself, but it’s making progress, I hope? A negotiated peace is,\nafter all, what we’re all hoping for.”\nWith great difficulty, Hilo kept the sneer off his face by lifting his glass\nand draining half of it. Chancellor Son’s eyes flicked down to the sight of\nHilo’s hand, the callused knuckles covered with recent scabs, and was less\nsuccessful than his guest in not betraying his contempt; his mouth twitched,\nwobbling his jowls for a second, before he said, “The sooner the clans can\nresolve their differences and return our city to normal, the better. For the sake\nof the people and the country.”\n“The Mountain murdered my brother.”"

        "text": "resolve their differences and return our city to normal, the better. For the sake\nof the people and the country.”\n“The Mountain murdered my brother.”\nSon Tomarho cleared his throat uncomfortably. “A terrible tragedy that\nwill never be forgotten. However, I would venture to say, based on my\nexperiences with Kaul Lan-jen, that he would’ve placed the ultimate good of\nthe clan and the nation foremost in his mind, ahead of any personal desire for\nvengeance.”\n“I’m not Lan.” And suddenly, having said these words aloud, Hilo\nrelaxed. A smile returned. “The Lantern Men and the Royal Council will\nhave to accept that.”\nThe chancellor frowned for the first time. “The Lantern Men of No Peak,\nwhile they are unwavering in their loyalty and allegiance to the clan, are\nnaturally concerned for the safety of their communities and the hardship\nthat’s being imposed on them.”\n“You mean the increase in tribute payments,” Hilo inferred. “It’s true\nwe’ve had to raise tribute in order to fight the war. The Weather Man can\nspeak to that.”\nIt was not the most graceful way to give Shae permission to speak, but\nHilo was losing patience for the niceties. Besides, he’d been Perceiving for\nsome time Shae’s aura bristling with anxiety that he would fuck this meeting\nup, and he might as well let her say her piece. Shae leaned forward at once\nand said, “As you’ve said, Chancellor, war between the clans has disrupted\nbusiness. No Peak is obligated to provide financial aid to our Lantern Men\nwhose property has been damaged or whose livelihoods have been affected.\nWhen Green Bones are killed, we pay for their funerals and provide for their\nfamilies. When they’re injured, there are medical bills to account for.\nUnfortunately, the Mountain has a substantial financial advantage over us as\na result of manufacturing SN1 overseas and appropriating jade outside of the\npurview of the Kekon Jade Alliance. The official audit results haven’t been\nreleased, but I can provide you with all the proof you require.” She inclined\nher head and concluded firmly, “No Peak needs the full support of its Lantern\nMen right now, and we’ve raised tribute only so far as necessary on those\nwho can bear it. If you wish to see the details of how we’ve calculated the\nnew rates, I’d be more than willing to share them.”\nHilo was impressed; his sister sounded like a real Weather Man.\nChancellor Son leaned back in his chair, crossing his well-padded arms. “I\ndon’t doubt your math, but the reality is that increased tribute is a hardship\nfor even the most loyal clan members. It will be seen as particularly poor\nthanks for those”—and here Hilo had no doubt Son was referring to himself\n—“who’ve been tirelessly driving, on Kaul Lan-jen’s mandate, the passage of\nbills legislating inspection and reform of the KJA.”\n“Fuck the KJA,” said Hilo. “What happens there doesn’t matter.”\nSon Tomarho’s face went momentarily blank. “Kaul-jen,” he said at last,\ncompletely nonplussed, “your brother—let the gods recognize him—believed\nstrongly in establishing ownership safeguards around the national jade supply\n—”\n“My brother was trying to prevent war.

        "text": "strongly in establishing ownership safeguards around the national jade supply\n—”\n“My brother was trying to prevent war. Now we’re at war. Whoever wins\nis going to control the city, and the council, and the jade supply. If the\nMountain takes over No Peak to become the single most powerful clan on\nKekon, do you really think Ayt’s going to give a sick dog’s wet shit about\nyour legislation?” Pushing back from the table, Hilo stood up and stretched,\nstiff from a host of recently acquired minor injuries.\nSurprised but following his lead, Shae stood up with him, but Chancellor\nSon remained seated, apparently at a loss for how to respond. Finally, he rose\nto his feet and said, with no remaining trace of his practiced geniality, “So\nyou mean to disregard the concerns of the Lantern Men, then? And to dismiss\nthe efforts of the council?”\n“Not at all,” said Hilo. It was true that he was not Lan. He did not have\nLan’s gravity nor his diplomatic acumen, he couldn’t handle this the way Lan\nwould’ve handled it, but he’d dealt with disgruntled subordinates and\nunhappy Lantern Men before, on his side of the clan. “The clan would be\nworthless without its Lantern Men and without people like you, Chancellor,”\nhe said. “But I’m starting to think that after so many years of peace, some\npeople have forgotten why they pay tribute. I’ve always been taught that back\nduring the war the Lantern Men were patriots who risked their lives to help\nGreen Bones, because Green Bones protected the people when the country\nwas in danger.\n“We’re at war again now, and the country will be in danger if No Peak\nfalls to the Mountain. If one clan controls jade. Isn’t that what Lan was afraid\nof when he came to you?” Hilo fixed the chancellor with a penetrating stare.\nIt was not unfriendly, but there was a predatory quality to Hilo’s stare that\nmade many people flinch or lower their eyes when subjected to it, and the\nchancellor was no exception.\n“I can see you don’t like me much,” said Hilo with cool amiability. “But\nI’m the Pillar, and you’re the highest politician in the country with ties to No\nPeak. We’re clan brothers, of a sort. We both want to win this and come out\nalive.”\nSon’s eyes widened. “I want what’s best for Kekon, Kaul-jen. And that’s\npeace between the clans. That’s why I moved immediately to form the\nmediation committee.”\n“The mediation’s a fucking farce,” said Hilo. “You’ll find out why soon\nenough. So we’ve got to win this thing. And that means the Lantern Men\nhave got to be wartime Lantern Men. They’ve got to stick their necks out for\nthe clan. Prove that allegiance that they’re always going on about when they\ncome asking us for this or that. They’ve got to pay the higher tributes—and\nyou have to make sure they do it.”\nChancellor Son burst into a coughing, nervous laugh. “There are\nthousands of Lantern Men in the clan. You’re deliberately making decisions\nthat risk a mass defection from No Peak. You can hardly expect that I ought\nto be held responsible—”\n“What’s that number again?” Hilo turned slightly over his shoulder"

        "text": "that risk a mass defection from No Peak. You can hardly expect that I ought\nto be held responsible—”\n“What’s that number again?” Hilo turned slightly over his shoulder\ntoward Shae. “How many companies make up some large percent of the\nclan’s business?”\n“The twenty-five largest No Peak affiliated entities account for sixty-five\npercent of the clan’s tributary income,” said the Weather Man.\nHilo turned back to Son with satisfaction. “Right. So what the big dogs\ndecide is what matters. All the little dogs will follow. The Son family is one\nof the big dogs. It has to go to the others and convince them to fall into line.\nMake them see that they might have to suffer a little right now, but it’s so the\nclan can win. People are people, whether they’re Lantern Men or Fists, jaded\nor not; they’ll run when they lose hope, but they’ll put up with any hardship\nif they think they’ll come out on top in the end.”\nSon tugged at his collar, which he abruptly seemed to be finding too tight\nfor his bulging neck. “There could well be many Lantern Men who would\nrather defect to the Mountain than commit themselves to No Peak under such\n… unyielding terms.”\nThe Pillar appeared to consider this. “You wouldn’t be one of those\npeople, would you, Chancellor?” he asked quietly. “If the Mountain destroys\nNo Peak and takes the city, I’ll be dead. My entire family will be dead.\nYou’re the one who’ll live with what happens afterward.”\nHilo could see the wheels turning in the politician’s head. Jaded or not,\none did not rise to power in Janloon without a great deal of shrewdness and a\npowerful instinct for survival, and Chancellor Son was well aware of the fact\nthat he was far too closely and publicly tied to No Peak to survive politically\nin a city ruled by the Mountain. Son had orchestrated the KJA reform bills\nand the financial audit meant to expose the Mountain’s illegal activities. His\ndaughters ran a No Peak tribute business and had married into the clan; one\nof his sons-in-law was a Luckbringer and the other was a midrank Fist. His\npolitical and business allies would be targeted by Mountain-affiliated rivals.\nThere was no escape for Son Tomarho, any more than for the Kauls.\nHilo saw all these thoughts writ in the chancellor’s deeply resentful\nsilence, and he felt compelled to walk around the huge desk to the man. Son\nseemed slumped into his own bulk, making no effort to move away and only\ntensing in a half-hearted way when Hilo laid a hand on his ample shoulder.\n“My grandfather and my older brother had great respect for you,” Hilo said\nsolemnly. “So I have respect for you, even if I can see on your face that you\ndon’t respect me as Pillar. Normally, I wouldn’t put up with that, but I’m\nwilling to forgive it because of course I understand: Why would you accept\nme after years of dealing with Lan? There’s one thing I’ll say, though: So\nlong as I live, I’ll never turn my back on a friend. Ask any one of my Fists,\nanyone who knows me, even my enemies, and they’ll tell you if what I say is"

You’re already an old friend of the clan, so if you’re willing to forget\nmy disrespect in not coming to you earlier, I’ll gladly forget your slights to\nme. If we survive this together, we’ll be like brothers-in-arms. What a laugh\nthat’ll be, won’t it, two men as different as us? But the clan needs both of us\nto stand firm now.”\nSon drew a breath into his large frame and blew out loudly. When he\nturned to look at Hilo, he wore the dignified expression of a veteran\nstatesman making an unfortunate but unavoidable decision and girding\nhimself to face the inevitable storm to follow. The chancellor might not be\npleased or willing, but at least Hilo could see the man’s reluctant regard, his\ngrudging reassessment of the new Pillar. “I am loyal to the clan, and you’ve\nmade your position quite clear, Kaul-jen,” Son said, with a touch of bitterness\nand admiration. “I believe we have a mutual understanding.” And he brought\nhis clasped hands up to touch his forehead, inclining into a salute.\n“What was that?” Shae hissed as they walked from Son’s office down to the\nmediation committee’s meeting room. “That wasn’t what we’d planned.”\n“It went fine.” Despite having achieved what he wanted with Son, Hilo\nwas not smiling as he strode down the marbled hallway with grim purpose.\nHe resisted the urge to append some smug remark to his sister about what had\nhappened. You didn’t need to speak sweetly and offer patronage at every turn\nto these people. You had to be honest with them and show that they had more\nto gain from your friendship than your enmity. Did she think his Fists obeyed\nhim because they were rewarded with favors or cowed by threats? No.\nMutual survival was the basis of brotherhood and loyalty, even of love.\n“What is it? What haven’t you told me?” Shae whispered urgently as they\nreached the doors of the meeting room. She could Perceive his cold fury and\naggravation. He didn’t answer her, merely pulled open the door and strode in;\nshe’d know soon enough.\nThe meeting with the chancellor had delayed them; they were the last to\narrive. Ayt and Ree were already there, Ayt conversing formally but amiably\nwith two of the councilmen that Hilo knew to be Mountain loyalists. Hilo\ndropped into his chair without apology for the tardiness. From across the\nroom, the other Pillar turned her head toward him, unable to avoid Perceiving\nthe ferocity in his aura. Others in the room shifted uneasily, sensing the\nchange as well. The first two sessions had been expectedly tense. This was\ndifferent. Something had brought Hilo to a true temper.\nCouncilwoman Onde cleared her throat. “As we’re now all present, let’s\nbegin where we left off yesterday.” She seemed uncertain of how to proceed\nand flipped nervously through the copious notes on her yellow legal pad.\n“We were discussing the financial terms of a peace agreement between the"

        "text": "begin where we left off yesterday.” She seemed uncertain of how to proceed\nand flipped nervously through the copious notes on her yellow legal pad.\n“We were discussing the financial terms of a peace agreement between the\nclans.” Onde glanced at Hilo but hesitated to call on him. Instead she turned\nto the Mountain Pillar and said, “Ayt-jen, I believe you were about to make a\nproposal at the close of our session yesterday.”\nAyt Mada wore an expression of complacent curiosity as she regarded\nHilo. It was clear that something she had said or done had gotten to him, and\nshe seemed eager to discover whether her foolhardy young rival would\nfinally explode and make a spectacle of himself. Ayt laced her fingers. The\nloose sleeves of her silk blouse slid down her forearms, revealing snaking\ncoils of jade. “Yes, Chairwoman,” she said, “I was explaining that No Peak’s\noffenses against us over the past year have been so costly that it is only\nreasonable we discuss reparations.”\nReparations! It was too perfect; Hilo leaned his head back and laughed.\nNo one else at the table seemed to think his outburst of mirth and\ncontempt was appropriate. The No Peak council members stared at him,\naghast, and he could feel Shae’s aura raking him with disapproval. “Kaul-\njen,” said Councilwoman Onde, with nervous admonishment. “Ayt-jen has\nbrought up the very valid and serious issue of financial settlement. Your\nresponse suggests you’re dismissing the idea as humorous. The committee\nwould appreciate it if you would elaborate on your position calmly.”\nHilo leaned forward, a forearm on the table, the other hand pressing\nagainst the arm of his chair so he nearly rose from his seat. The room froze as\nthe amusement on Hilo’s face transformed into menace. In a soft, flat voice\nthat carried in the frightening silence, he said to the other Pillar, “Enough\nbullshit, Ayt. You’re a thief. A jade thief.”\nIt was the worst sort of insult between Green Bones, to suggest a person\ndid not deserve the jade she carried, that she’d come about it dishonorably.\nFor a second, Ayt’s face went entirely still and her eyes burned with a light\nthat appeared as if she’d fly out of her seat to snap Hilo’s spine. Then with\nimpressive aplomb, she turned a calm face to Councilwoman Onde. “It\nappears Kaul-jen has no respect for these proceedings.”\n“Don’t talk to them!” Hilo barked. “You’ll talk to me.” For the first time,\nhe saw Ayt regard him in a tense assessment that held something other than\ncontempt. “The Mountain is behind the discrepancies in the KJA’s records.\nDon’t lie to my face, thief. You’ve been taking jade above quota from the\nmines all year.”\nBehind him, Shae sucked in a breath. Her jade aura flared and bathed him\nin shock and recrimination. What are you doing? He could sense her shouting\nat him in her mind. Their trump card, their biggest charge against the\nMountain—he’d thrown it down more than two days early, without waiting\nfor the audit results, without clearing it with her or gathering the support of\nNo Peak loyalists on the council.

He’d ruined her plan; they’d lost the\npotential leverage of using the public disclosure of the audit results as a\nbargaining chip against the Mountain. Shae was furious. He could tell she\nkept herself silently in check now only because the Weather Man speaking\nout in this public forum without the Pillar’s cue would only make them look\nworse.\nAyt, however, had recovered her poise. He was acting impulsive and\ndesperate, as she’d expected. Nodding at something Ree Tura whispered\nquickly into her ear, she said, “Councilmen, I’ve offered up genuine\nterritorial and business grievances. Kaul-jen throws out one preposterous,\nunfounded suspicion. Whatever the reason for the purported accounting\ndiscrepancies in the KJA, I’m sure the audit will reveal them to be due to\nunintended negligence rather than malice. This accusation is a distraction.”\nHilo threw his hands up to gesture at the entire room. “This is a\ndistraction. There’s no mediation that can happen here.” He pointed at\nCouncilwoman Onde, who shrank back slightly. “You want peace? All of\nyou want peace? There’s only one kind of peace the Mountain will accept:\none clan in power. In complete control of both jade and shine. Gold and jade\ntogether. Tell me if that’s the peace you want.”\nThe people around the table were shifting uncomfortably. Among the No\nPeak councilmen, Mrs. Nurh sat openmouthed, Mr. Loyi was frowning. Mr.\nVang and Mr. Kowi were looking from Hilo, to Shae, to each other, in\nstunned indecision of how to handle the situation. They had not been\nconsulted on any of this.\n“Kaul-jen!” said Onde with admirable authority. “I must ask you to—”\nAyt interrupted, her voice like steel. “The Mountain is the largest clan in\nthe country. We have a reliable and adequate supply of jade, and we hold\nnearly half the votes on the board of the KJA. Why would we need to steal\nwhat we openly control?”\n“What a good question.” Hilo tilted his head, scratching his jaw as if\ngenuinely perplexed. “Maybe you aren’t stealing it for yourselves. Maybe\nyou’re finding some other use for that jade that you don’t want other Green\nBones to know about.” Shadows darkened his face. “Smuggling it on the\nblack market through people like Tem Ben the Carver. Putting it in the hands\nof water-blooded crooks, like your informer Mudt Jindonon, who runs crime\nrings in No Peak territory with the Mountain’s blessing. And with jade.” The\nword came out as a snarl. Hilo rose slowly from his seat. “How many\nuntrained, jade-fevered, shine-addicted gangsters are running around in the\ncity, spying, thieving, wreaking havoc in the territory of other clans on the\nMountain’s orders, in exchange for jade they have no right to wear? How big\nare the Mountain’s ranks, when you include them in the count?”\nAyt’s body remained motionless, but her head drew up in slow"

How big\nare the Mountain’s ranks, when you include them in the count?”\nAyt’s body remained motionless, but her head drew up in slow\nmalevolence, neck lengthening like a rearing viper. Her aura burned with\nmurderous intent. When she spoke, it was entirely without the practiced\nprofessionalism she’d shown earlier. It was like a sharp blade being drawn\ndelicately across flesh. “How do you come up with such elaborate stories,\nKaul Hiloshudon?”\nHilo reached for his breast pocket. Everyone flinched, except for Ayt,\nwho made no move as Hilo pulled out a black cassette tape. “The stone-eye\nTem Ben told it to me. He and Mudt are feeding worms at the bottom of the\nharbor now.” He tossed the tape on the table. It skidded to the center and lay\nthere like an explosive device no one would touch. Hilo leaned his hands on\nthe table and spoke in a whisper. “I found two of the weeds you planted in\nmy yard, thief, and I’m going to find the others. The next time we meet, it\nwon’t be in this room and there won’t be any mediation.”\nHilo turned and walked out the door. For a second, Shae remained seated,\nthen he heard her stand up and follow him silently out. Neither of them\nspoke.\nThe phone call came two days later. “Ayt-jen wishes to meet with you\nalone,” said Ree Tura from the other end of the line. “Somewhere neutral and\nprivate.”\n“What assurances do I have?” Shae asked.\nRee’s slightly nasal voice lowered, as if he were leaning forward. “I’m\nspeaking as one Weather Man to another, Kaul-jen. We aren’t thugs. Choose\nthe time and place.”\nAfter a moment of thought, Shae said, “The Temple of Divine Return. In\nthe back of the sanctum, tomorrow night.” She hung up.\nCHAPTER\n47\nHeaven is Listening\nS\nhae arrived early at the temple the next evening. She walked silently into\nthe sanctum and knelt on a cushion in the back corner. The Deitist house of\nworship held a different quality for her now than it had when she’d come\nhere a few months ago. Jade made it different. That other time felt like a\ndistant half-waking dream for so many reasons. Now it was clear to her that\nwhat felt like stillness and silence to the ordinary person was in reality a\nconstant, crooning musical hum of energy, filling the sanctum, radiating into\nthe marrow of one’s bones. The six cross-legged penitents, in perfect\nstillness, radiated powerful auras that filled her Perception as completely as if\nshe were staring into a floodlight that blotted out the center of her vision,\nleaving only the dim periphery untouched. As blinding as they were, the\nauras of the penitents were calm, as if they were harmonized in the same deep\ndream-filled sleep, their breathing as gentle as the wind rustling the prayer\ncards and leaves of the devotional trees in the courtyard.\nThe last time Shae had knelt in doubt and indecision and prayed in the\ntemple, she had not truly believed that she would be unequivocally answered"

Bathed in the energetic resonance surrounding\nher now, Shae shivered inwardly, for she no longer doubted that this was a\nholy place, a place where the gods might be paying attention.\nThat did not mean it was a kind place; indeed, it was more dangerous than\nany other. Anything said or even contemplated in here would be heard by the\npenitents, might reach the ears of Heaven. Shae touched her head to the\nground three times. She whispered, “Yatto, Father of All, I beg you recognize\nmy brother, Kaul Lanshinwan, gone from this earth to await the Return. He\nwas a follower of Jenshu, whom we call Old Uncle, and though he might not\nhave come to this temple much, he had humility, compassion, courage, and\ngoodness—more of the Divine Virtues than any Green Bone I know.” Shae\nclosed her eyes and fell silent. She would have said more, she would’ve\npleaded consideration for her grandfather, and for Hilo, and even for Doru,\nbut she couldn’t afford the time for contemplation and mourning, not tonight.\nShe was here to learn what information she could from a deadly enemy. She\nneeded to be clear in mind and prepared in body.\nAyt Mada’s entrance into the sanctum interposed on the edges of Shae’s\nPerception like a spear of red heat parting the slow energetic thrum of the\ntemple, a harsh chord sounding over a low melody. Shae waited, focusing on\nher own composure, not betraying her unease. Ayt did not pause or look\naround the sanctum. She went straight to Shae and knelt on the cushion\nbeside her. Ayt did not look at the other woman, nor did she touch her head\nto the ground as was religious custom.\n“You should know,” she said, “that I did not order the death of Kaul Lan.”\nEverything about Ayt Mada—her speech, her movements, and her aura—\nbespoke directness and control. During the time Shae had been in her\npresence in Wisdom Hall, she’d gathered that, beyond jade ability and\ntraining, it was constant unsentimental decisiveness that enabled Ayt to\novercome all the male rivals in her clan. Even her pauses always seemed\ndeliberate, never a symptom of hesitation or uncertainty. She let one of them\nrest between herself and Shae before speaking again. “I had no reason to\nwant your eldest brother dead. He was a reasonable man. Overshadowed by\nhis grandfather, perhaps, but nevertheless an intelligent and respected leader.\nSooner or later he would come to the proper conclusion, I was confident of\nthat. We would’ve negotiated an agreement between our clans and avoided\nall this unpleasantness.”\nShae found it hard to speak from fury that made her vision waver. “My\nbrother lies cold in the ground. You expect me to believe you didn’t put him\nthere?”\n“Any Green Bone in the Mountain would’ve been proud to win Kaul\nLan’s jade. No one has claimed that accomplishment. Doesn’t that strike you\nas odd?”"

        "text": "there?”\n“Any Green Bone in the Mountain would’ve been proud to win Kaul\nLan’s jade. No one has claimed that accomplishment. Doesn’t that strike you\nas odd?”\n“The taxi driver that picked him up from the Lilac Divine said they were\nfollowed by men in a black car. Someone knew his habits and was waiting\nfor him that night. Several people on the street heard gunfire down by the\npier, and there were countless bullet holes near the place his body was found.\nTwo unregistered, damaged Fullerton machine guns were found on the dock\n—hardly the sort of weapon carried by common criminals in No Peak\nterritory. The men who killed him were working for the Mountain. You lie if\nyou deny it.” She was grateful, and mildly amazed, that she was able to state\nall this with the matter-of-fact self-possession of a true Weather Man. “The\nPillar is the master of the clan, the spine of the body, without which nothing\nmoves. Unless you mean to convince me that those men were acting against\nyour orders, how can you sit here and say you didn’t kill him?”\n“You’re correct, Kaul-jen,” Ayt said, surprising Shae with formal address.\n“I’m responsible for his death—but I didn’t whisper his name. I wanted to\nsend a message deep into No Peak, to impress upon Kaul Lanshinwan the\nrealization that going to war with the Mountain would be unwise and\nultimately futile. In doing so, I hoped to avoid the war, or at least shorten it.\nThings didn’t go as I intended.”\n“Because it was Hilo you always meant to kill.”\n“Yes.”\nFor a second, Shae allowed herself to contemplate with morbid curiosity\nthe idea of an entirely different unfolding of tragedy. Had the initial\nassassination attempt succeeded, Hilo’s death would’ve been a terrible blow\nto Lan, but Ayt was not unreasonable in suspecting that the Pillar’s sense of\npragmatism and responsibility would’ve ultimately won out over the desire\nfor vengeance. Without a strong Horn to rely on, Lan most likely would’ve\nacceded to terms of peace rather than risk the entire clan in a disadvantaged\nwar.\nShae brought her attention back to the moment at hand. Possibilities that\nlay in the past were illusions, closed doors, as meaningless as unfulfilled\nintentions. “You asked to meet with me,” she reminded Ayt. “It wasn’t\nmerely to try and convince me that you only wanted to kill one of my\nbrothers instead of both.”\nAyt said sharply, “This war is pointless and destructive to both our clans.\nThe audit of the KJA was childish and unnecessary; it invited the Royal\nCouncil and the press to come snooping into Green Bone matters. Is that\nsomething we really need when we can solve these issues quietly between\nus? The politicians have gotten it into their heads to try and pass some\nbureaucratic legislation, or form some oversight body—for what ultimate\nbenefit? We may even attract international attention, and the last thing the\ncountry needs is more self-serving foreigners meddling in our affairs.”\n“You brought it on yourself,” Shae replied. “The Mountain has been\nblatantly breaking the rules of the Kekon Jade Alliance. Doru has been\ncovering for you.”\n“Doru is a farsighted man, loyal to Kaul Sen and the ideals he stood for,”"

        "text": "blatantly breaking the rules of the Kekon Jade Alliance. Doru has been\ncovering for you.”\n“Doru is a farsighted man, loyal to Kaul Sen and the ideals he stood for,”\nAyt said. “He realized that neither of the Torch’s grandsons could replace\nhim and that an alliance was inevitable.” She turned to Shae with eyes that\nheld the coldness that came from absence of doubt. “It is exactly that, Kaul-\njen—inevitable.”\n“An alliance?” Shae said. “Why not just call it what it is? Destroying your\nenemies. Complete power in the city and monopolistic control of the\ncountry’s jade.”\nAyt studied her with such cool consideration that Shae felt in that moment\na flutter of fear, like a moth in her rib cage. Ayt was not much larger than her\nphysically, but that meant next to nothing when it came to a contest of jade\nability. This was a woman who’d killed before her father’s funeral and did\nnot bow in a temple of the gods. Perhaps she would even strike in the\npresence of a penitent. If she wanted to kill Shae now, there was nothing to\nstop her. Shae forced a calming awareness into her body, deliberately noting\nthe relaxed state of each muscle and joint. Ayt was so close she would\nPerceive fear with no effort, no matter how composed Shae’s face.\nAt last Ayt spoke, as if she were lecturing a stubborn student. “You’re an\neducated and traveled woman, not like those who’ve never left the country.\nConsider what’s happening outside Kekon. Tension between Espenia and\nYgutan grows day by day. The world is dividing into camps, and both sides\ncovet the jade found only on this island. What kind of fortune did the\nEspenians spend to create SN1, so they could equip their elite soldiers with\njade? The Ygutanians are playing catch-up, but they certainly want no less.\nI’m told they’ve been researching how to make their soldiers more naturally\nresistant, more like us. The Shotarians did the same thing years ago—brought\nKekonese and Abukei women to secret facilities to be raped and\nimpregnated, in an attempt to create a Shotarian army with natural jade\nresistance.\n“We’re a small country with a precious resource. If we don’t take the right\nactions, we’ll find ourselves at the mercy of imperial powers again. The only\nway for us to resist the foreigners in the long run is to be united as one clan\nagain.”\n“United by conquest, you mean. First you had to weaken No Peak. You\nmight have tried to negotiate an upfront alliance with Lan, but instead you\ncolluded with Doru and supplied jade and tip-offs to gangsters within our\nterritories.”\nAyt was unmoved by Shae’s anger. “It’s as you say. The Pillar is the\nmaster of the clan, the spine of the body. There can be only one spine. Kaul\nLan was a proud man; he wouldn’t have willingly relinquished control of his\nclan, certainly not while he had the strength of his Horn behind him. And\nGont Asch and Kaul Hilo couldn’t be in one clan any more than two cocks\ncould share a henhouse. We had to establish supremacy in the streets before"

We had to establish supremacy in the streets before\nan honest and productive conversation could begin.”\n“Where is the additional jade you’ve been taking from the mines?”\nAyt astonished Shae by answering at once. “We’re selling it to the\nYgutanians. The contract is entirely secret, of course, because of Kekon’s\npublic alliance with Espenia. But we know the Ygutanians are already\nacquiring jade through the black market. No matter what we do, how strictly\nwe crack down, smuggling remains a problem. The potential profit for\nsmugglers is so high they cannot be dissuaded even with death penalties. If\nwe offer the Ygutanians a reliable supply, we’ll destroy the underground\ntrade. There will be less crime on Kekon, and far more profit to the clan.\nWe’ll be supplier to both sides of the mounting conflict. We’ll ensure our\nsecurity and protect our income no matter which foreigners prevail.”\n“That’s why you’re also starting to produce shine.” Shae could not help\nbut admire the simplicity of it now. “You can’t sell that quantity of jade to\nthe Ygutanians without also promising them the shine to go with it.”\n“Factories on the mainland, manufacturing SN1 quickly and cheaply. Not\nthe sort of stuff we’d ever want here on the island, but good enough for the\nforeigners. The Ygutanians do not know the difference, and they have so\nmany people, they treat them as expendable anyway.”\nHow much money was the Mountain already bringing in from its secret\ncontracts, Shae wondered. Siphoning jade from the national coffers, selling it\nto foreigners, trafficking in shine … it must be millions of dien. Hundreds of\nmillions.\nAyt’s voice took on an edge of excitement. Shae sensed in the heavy\ntexture of her aura a driven and deadly tenaciousness, like that of some\npurebred hunting animal that once set to quarry would rather run until it falls\ndead than give up the chase. She angled to face Shae directly now, and said,\n“If we introduce a reliable supply of cheap SN1 into the market, sales of jade\ngo up and we profit. If we shut off the spigot, foreign governments will have\nto contend with jaded people going mad, unable to control their powers,\ndying of the Itches. With that kind of market power, we Green Bones will\nretain rightful control over jade—and we’ll have the wealth and means to\nprotect the country, as we’ve always done.”\nShae was silent for a moment before answering. “It really is, Ayt-jen, a\nvisionary and cunning strategy.” She meant it; Ayt was truly a higher-level\nPillar, not satisfied with merely continuing her father’s legacy but intent on\naltering the path of the clan and the country as a whole. A formidable\nsuccessor to the Spear of Kekon.\nUnder Ayt’s leadership, the Mountain clan would build an international\nempire of jade and drugs. It would eliminate or subsume its rivals until one\nclan ruled Kekon. The country would foment global tensions and profit by\nspreading the availability of jade and shine to millions of people beyond its\nborders, with Green Bones sitting at the apex of a burgeoning jade pyramid\nthey controlled."

There are few enough of\nus in the world of Green Bones, the world of men. I know that you were the\ntop graduate at the Academy and the favorite of Kaul Seningtun, and yet you\nwere obscured by your brothers. You discovered the clan was an insular,\nconstricting place. That’s how you came to work for the Espenian military,\nand afterward, why you left Kekon.”\nHeat climbed up Shae’s chest and neck at Ayt’s presumptuous but\nessentially accurate description. How had Ayt learned these things? She was\nindignant yet strangely flattered that the Pillar of the Mountain had thought to\ndig into her past in an attempt to find the right leverage to use on her.\n“I see some of my younger self in you, Kaul Shae-jen. If I had known you\nwould return to Kekon and wear jade again, I’d have approached you much\nearlier. Let the two of us resolve this feud. Your brother is a dangerous,\nfoolish man-child driven by pride and bloodlust; he would fight to the last\nman on principle alone. It’s what he knows how to do.” Shae knew what was\ncoming next. “Usurp him. End this senseless war. Ree Tura is near\nretirement, and I tire of him regardless. I would make you my Weather Man.\nWeather Man of a great clan; Weather Man of Kekon itself.”\n“You overestimate me, Ayt-jen,” Shae said, hearing something pitted and\nsour scrape in her voice. “I’ve been gone from Kekon for years and am still\nan outsider in my own clan. The Luckbringers and Lantern Men accept me\ngrudgingly. All the Fists and Fingers of No Peak are loyal to my brother.”\n“There’s no reason for them not to remain so. We can arrange things\nsimply between us. Make it appear honorable. Kaul Hilo can fall in battle as\nthe war hero he clearly wishes to be. There’d be no taint of treachery for you,\nno worry of vengeance from his followers. Afterward, you’d be acting with\nfull legitimacy.”\nShae nodded. An ambush then, getting Hilo alone at a place and time of\ntheir choosing. This time the Mountain would see to it that the assassination\nplan was better, foolproof. How easily Ayt spoke of all this, as if necessary\nfratricide was no less difficult to arrange than any other business transaction.\nTruly, she doesn’t fear the judgment of either men or gods. Shae’s stir of\nunbidden admiration tasted acidic in her throat. Ayt was a stronger woman\nthan she.\nShae glanced in the direction of the penitents, who still sat unmoving,\ntheir auras unperturbed by the content of the conversation they might be\nexposing to Heaven itself. Is anyone listening? Perhaps, Shae thought with\nsudden heaviness, the penitents meditated in vain. Jade-enhanced senses and\nthe power of Perception endowed Green Bones with so much more nuance"

Was Old Uncle Jenshu paying attention now? Did\nhe grieve what had become of the legacy of honorable warriors? The Return\ncouldn’t be further away than Green Bones plotting murder in the sanctum of\nthe temple.\nAyt had seen clearly Shae’s ambition and resentment, had seized upon her\nrivalry with Hilo as an opening. Shae understood what that said about her: If\nthe way to redemption was through the Divine Virtues, she was no closer to\nHeaven than the woman next to her. She turned to Ayt now. “You say you\nsee your younger self in me,” she said. “I see in you the kind of Green Bone I\ndon’t want to become. Jade meant something once. I’m not an oath breaker. I\nwon’t betray the memory of a slain brother, and sell the life of another for\npower.” She stood up, wondering as she did so if she’d just sealed her own\ndeath. “I want no part of the Kekon you envision.”\nAyt remained sitting for a few seconds. Then she rose to her feet and\nfaced the younger woman. Her expression was unchanged, but her aura\nswelled with unmistakably ominous intent, and despite herself, Shae took an\ninvoluntary step back.\n“I despise it when my hand is forced,” the Pillar said, adjusting one of the\ncoils of jade on her arm. “Ayt Yugontin brought me, a girl that should have\ndied, out of a war orphanage and trained me to be the strongest Green Bone\nin the Mountain clan. Yet when he grew old, he couldn’t bring himself to\nname me his heir. He feared a backlash from the inner circle of men in the\nclan who would fault him for naming a woman his successor. The Spear of\nKekon, who was never afraid to die fighting the Shotarians—he was afraid to\nname an adopted daughter to rule his precious clan.\n“The man I call my father, the one to whom I owe everything—he forced\nmy hand. Before his body was cold, I had to kill his closest comrades—Green\nBones I valued and respected—for the position that should have been mine\nwithout question. With his dying breath my father could have prevented\nbloodshed, but he didn’t. Such is the cowardice and shortsightedness of even\nthe most well-meaning of men.”\nThe expression of disappointment on Ayt’s face held a frightening calm as\nshe said to Shae, “I’ve offered you an opportunity that you’ve spurned. Don’t\nworry, you naive and idealistic girl, I won’t kill you now. I want you to\nremember, when you see your brother’s jade torn from his mangled body,\nwhen your clan lies in ashes, that you could have prevented it but didn’t. You\nforced my hand. You’ll remember.”\nAyt turned and swept from the sanctum, the wake of her passing stirring\nthe holy room like a hot wind carrying the promise of drought and punishing\ndevastation. Then she was gone, and the temple was once again harmonious."

Then she was gone, and the temple was once again harmonious.\nThe penitents sitting in the circle had not stirred. Alone now, the strain broke\nthrough Shae’s control. Her heart began racing and sweat beaded on her face.\nShe sank back down onto the cushion.\nHeaven help us. My clan, all Green Bones, all of Kekon.\nCHAPTER\n48\nReading the Clouds\nH\nilo was furious at his sister. He stormed into the main Kaul house and\nfound her at the table in Lan’s study with Woon. Unlike him, she seemed to\nenjoy retreating in here, though he’d never seen her sit in Lan’s chair; he\nwould’ve forbidden her from using the room if she’d done that.\nBoth Shae and Woon were waiting for him silently when he barged\nthrough the doors; it would’ve been hard not to Perceive his approach. He\nswept an arm across the table, scattering papers everywhere, involuntarily\nDeflecting Lan’s empty chair into the back wall and books off the\nbookshelves. Hilo placed both hands on the table and leaned over his\nWeather Man.\n“Doru escaped,” he said.\nShae paled, understanding the disastrous import at once. The traitor would\nflee straight to the Mountain, taking with him everything there was to know\nabout No Peak’s business secrets, not to mention knowledge of the Kaul\nestate and its defenses.\n“You made me keep him alive, you convinced me he wouldn’t be a threat.\nI shouldn’t have listened to you. I should’ve killed that snake!” Hilo’s face\nwas flushed, his eyes bulging. His hands clenched and unclenched as if\ndesperate to wrap themselves around Doru’s absent throat.\nWoon pushed his chair back from the Pillar nervously, but Shae merely\nstared at her angry brother in astonishment. “How did he do it?” she asked.\n“Om’s knocked out with a broken jaw, and Nune is dead; the old bastard\nsnapped his neck. They were just kids, those Fingers! New enough to jade\nthat they could go without it. How that withered scarecrow Doru could’ve—”\nSudden realization swept across Hilo’s features. A muscle in his cheek\ntwitched. “Grandda.” He whirled and strode back out of the study, nearly\ndizzy with fury. “Grandda!”\nShae leapt to follow him. He ignored her as he prowled up the staircase\nand flung open the door to their grandfather’s room. Kaul Sen sneered at him\nfrom his chair by the window, a look of smug vindictiveness painted on his\nwrinkled face. His eyes, so often weary and vacant these days, danced bright\nand cruel. “Don’t you know how to knock, boy?” he demanded in a raspy\nbark.\n“You.” Hilo’s eyes moved up and down, scanning the old man in disbelief.\n“You gave Doru jade. You gave him your jade.”\n“And why shouldn’t I?” Kaul Sen shouted. “You’re taking it all away\nfrom me anyway, you impudent wretch! You think I don’t notice?

This is all I\nhave left.” The patriarch pushed his blanket to the floor and flung open his\nrobe to reveal the sagging pale flesh of his torso over a belt now liberated of\nmost of its stones. It looked like an antique item, the belt, weathered and\nempty, something that belonged in a thrift shop. “It’s my jade. I’ll give it\naway if I want, to whomever I want!”\nHilo was at a loss for words. He’d made sure there was no jade in Doru’s\nhouse and that neither of the guards had any on them that might be stolen.\nThe former Weather Man might have betrayed the younger Kauls, but he\nwouldn’t take jade from the Torch any more than he would slit his only\nfriend’s throat. The idea that Kaul Sen would give away his jade had never\neven crossed Hilo’s mind. “You’ve lost your senses,” he said. “You’ve no\nidea what you’ve done.”\n“I set Doru free,” said his grandfather with a vicious smile. “He doesn’t\nhave to stay trapped here, putting up with such humiliation. The way you\ntreated him! The best Weather Man there ever was, a hero of the country!\nAnd you stripped him of his jade and locked him up like an animal, just like\nyou’re doing to me. Disgusting.”\nHilo took several trembling steps toward the old man in the chair, too\nenraged to even give voice to all his patricidal thoughts. Shae went\ndefensively to Kaul Sen’s side, her aura churning with agitation. She shot her\nbrother a warning look. “Hilo.”\nHilo stopped a few feet away, the knuckles of his fists white. His voice,\nwhen he spoke, was a whisper of loathing. “No one in this family could be\nPillar after you, could they, Grandda? Not Lan; certainly not me. No one but\nthe great Torch of Kekon. You dragged at and questioned Lan’s every step,\nand you’d laugh to see Ayt Yu’s daughter claim the jade off my body. Stay in\nthis room, then, until you die.”\nHe spun and left, slamming the door behind him. He came across Woon\nstanding at the bottom of the stairs, and forgetting, in his aggravation, that\nWoon was no longer Pillarman, he said, “Call Dr. Truw. I want that man\nsedated and the rest of his jade locked up. When Om’s awake, tell him he’s to\nguard Grandda’s room from now on. No phone calls or messages—if Doru\ntries to contact him, I want to know.”\nOn the front steps of the house, Hilo sat down and lit one of his remaining\nEspenian brand cigarettes. They were getting hard to find. The upsurge in\ncrime and violence was disrupting the flow of imported goods. Business was\nbad overall.\nWhy had he been so stupid? So softhearted? And Shae, always standing\nup for the old fiend. Dr. Truw had told them that Kaul Sen was sliding into\ndementia as his jade tolerance waned, that he was no longer cognizant of all\nhis actions, but Hilo thought his grandfather’s spiteful personality was simply\nmore transparent now."

It had been a bad couple of weeks since he’d made his\nstand in Wisdom Hall, since No Peak had declared peace to be impossible\nand committed the city to war. There had been some visible victories: The\nrelease of the KJA audit results had reflected badly on Ayt, and with\nChancellor Son leading the charge in publicly condemning the Mountain and\nwielding his influence, No Peak’s most important Lantern Men were\nmaintaining their allegiance, waiting to see what happened next.\nWhat was happening was that Gont was winning the street war. The\nMountain had apparently decided that there was no point holding back now.\nIt didn’t matter if No Peak held political or public sympathy if all its soldiers\nwere dead. Even with his own network of spies, Hilo had underestimated\nboth Gont’s genius for urban warfare and the extent to which the Mountain\nhad dug into No Peak territory by cultivating street gangs and mercenary\nagents that rose up to attack the clan within its own districts.\nShae came out of the house and stood behind him. “I’ll find Doru.” Her\nwords were stiff. “You’re right. It was my mistake. I spared his life, and it’ll\nbe my responsibility to correct that.”\n“He’s long gone,” said Hilo. “And he won’t be easy to get to again.”\n“I’ll get to him,” she promised.\nLet her try. He would set Tar to the task, and he wagered his man would\nget it done first. “It’ll be too late in any case,” he said without turning. He\ncouldn’t muster the energy to maintain his anger at her. “We have to assume\neverything Doru knows, the Mountain now knows. They’ll know which of\nour businesses are most valuable, which ones are weak, how much money\nand jade we have, how long we can hold out in the war.” He ground out his\ncigarette.\n“Then they’ll soon know it’s not long.”\nHe looked over his shoulder at her, then turned back around. “So it’s\nbad.”\nShae said, “Tourism is down over fifty percent, and that’s hurting us far\nmore than it’s hurting the Mountain. Some of their strongest sectors, like\nretail, are actually doing better in the war—people are stocking up on\nsupplies, and they’re motivated to buy things now instead of waiting, in case\na business isn’t there tomorrow.”\nWoon, who’d joined Shae by the door, added, “With the KJA suspended,\nmining and jade exports have stopped, so we have no income coming in\nthere.”\nThe Mountain would be feeling the loss as well, but they’d been hoarding\njade and would have greater reserves. Shae said, “We’re trading jade in the\nstreet war, but if they keep taking more from us than we’re taking from them,\nwe’ll deplete our supply. We still need to make Fingers out of the Academy’s\ngraduating class in two months.”\n“What about the minor clans?” Hilo asked. “Can we get anything from\nthem?”\nShae said, “The Short Tent clan and Six Hands Unity have lined up"

Stone Cup has sided with us—they\nhardly have a choice, given their dependence on the construction trade. The\nJo Sun clan and Black Tail clan have made noises of support, for all the good\nthat’ll do us. Lip service is appreciated, but you can’t wring much juice from\na grape.” There were roughly a dozen smaller clans on Kekon; some held\nsway in certain towns elsewhere on the island or were entrenched in specific\nindustries, some were independent and some were tributaries of the major\nclans, but none were even a sixth the size of either the Mountain or No Peak.\n“The rest are acting like Haedo Shield and staying clear, no doubt waiting to\nsend bouquets of dancing star lilies to whoever prevails,” Shae added.\nHilo stood up reluctantly and said, “Talk in the house.” They went inside,\nand though it still wasn’t his favorite room, he went into Lan’s study because\nit was private. Shae and Woon came in after him. The books and papers he’d\nscattered were still strewn all over the floor. Hilo stepped over them and fell\ninto one of the armchairs, motioning for Woon to shut the door behind him.\n“Tell me how long we can last.”\nShae said, “At this rate, we’ll be in the red in six months. That’s even if\nour Lantern Men stay with us, which they’ve done so far. It could be a lot\nless than that. It doesn’t matter what Son Tomarho says, and it doesn’t matter\nif people think Ayt is a crook. Once they sense we’re bound to lose, they’ll\nblame No Peak for dragging out the suffering of the city. They’ll start\nreneging on tributes and looking to the victors.”\n“And the Mountain? How long can they stay at war?”\n“We don’t know, but longer than us,” Woon said. “If they’re producing\nshine in Ygutan like they say, that’s an entirely separate and lucrative income\nstream.”\n“It’s worse than that,” Shae said. “They’re smuggling jade to the\nYgutanian government through secret contracts. That’s how they’re using\nsome of the supply they’ve spirited away from the mines—to get in bed with\nforeigners on the other side. Between that and the shine factories, my guess is\ntheir coffers are just fine.”\nHilo raised a puzzled expression to Shae. “How do you know the\nMountain has secret contracts to sell jade to Ygutan? Is this for sure?”\nShae sat down in the chair opposite him and crossed her legs, lacing her\nfingers over one knee. “The Weather Man reads the clouds,” she said. It was\nan old saying, meaning it was the Weather Man’s job to know things, to\ncultivate secret sources of information in order to stay one step ahead of\neveryone else. A smile crept to Hilo’s face upon hearing his younger sister\ncite such a hidebound clan adage, reminding him that a good Pillar did not\nquestion his Weather Man’s methods or sources too closely.

If he failed and was killed—they were the\nsame thing, as one would lead to the other—No Peak would likely perish\nwith him. He would be the last Pillar of his clan.\nIf there had been a more fitting leader upon Lan’s death, he would’ve\nstepped aside—kept the position of Horn, for which he was better suited, and\ndone his best to win the war in that way. But there had never been any\nchoice. Shae could not be the Pillar. Certainly she was smart and carried her\njade well, but the clan would not accept it. She was the youngest, a woman,\nand she was no Ayt Mada, who had been the eldest and still came to power\nonly by slaughtering all potential rivals. Shae would not do that, nor did she\nhave the necessary common touch, a force of character or charisma that\nwould compel other Green Bones, the powerful Fists in particular, to gladly\noffer their lives to continue fighting the war under her command if Hilo were\ndead. No, Hilo thought despondently, his sister was a study in aloof and self-\nsufficient competence, an able business leader but not a Green Bone Pillar.\nShe would want the position even less than he did.\nThere were no other heirs to the clan leadership. Anden was a Kaul by\nadoption, but he was too young, not even jaded yet, and of mixed blood. Ayt\nwould probably have him executed nevertheless, to be on the safe side. The\nMaik brothers were the sons of a disgraced Mountain Fist—they’d never be\naccepted as the head family of No Peak, if there was a No Peak clan to be\nhead of by that point. Kaul Sen had had an older sister, and Hilo’s mother had\ntwo younger siblings of little note, so there were some second- and third-\nremoved family cousins scattered throughout the clan, none of them with the\nname or upbringing of a Kaul, none prominent or accomplished enough to\nlead.\nHilo was accustomed to the idea of death, but contemplating the"

He thought about how he might join Lan in death knowing\nhe’d left unfulfilled the vengeance he’d sworn, and despaired that he hadn’t\nhad enough time to marry Wen and give her any children. He thought about\nthese things, wallowed deeply in the pain of them for a short spell, then\nslowly turned his mind back to the present.\nHe wasn’t dead yet. A man could be shot or stabbed, he could be fatally\nwounded, spurting his life out upon the ground, and still have a few precious\nminutes to bring down his enemy. Hilo had seen it before. Adversarial,\nopportunistic cunning was a Horn’s strength, and Hilo was a natural Horn.\nAnything could happen in a battle. The right person with the right opening\nand the right weapon—that meant everything.\nNow, he thought after some time, I can plan for death.\nCHAPTER\n49\nOverture to Adamont Capita\nT\nhe ferry crossing was located in a part of the Docks now under Mountain\ncontrol. Gont’s Fists and Fingers patrolled the area, on the lookout not only\nfor any counterattack by No Peak, but for thieves and smugglers who might\ntake advantage of the change in territorial oversight to step up their activities.\nWhen Maik Wen walked up to the gangplank of the ferry, one of Gont’s\nFingers stopped her and asked to see her ticket. “You’re going to Euman,\nmiss?”\n“Yes, jen,” Wen said. “My grandmother was born in Shosone.” A small\nfishing village on the western coast of Euman Island, now a tourist town\ncatering to both Kekonese vacationers and Espenian servicemen. “She\nwanted to be returned and laid to rest there.” Wen dropped her eyes sadly to\nthe blue funeral urn cradled in her arms. She was dressed in a simple white\nsweater and a long, white woolen skirt, and her face was brushed with white\npowder. Her heart was beating slightly faster than usual, but surely it was\nnormal for anyone stopped by an unfamiliar Green Bone from a recently\nconquering clan to be a little nervous, even if they had nothing to hide. This\nyoung man with the jade studs in his ears wouldn’t Perceive anything out of\nthe ordinary.\n“Let the gods recognize her.” Looking deeply embarrassed, he handed her\nticket back and said, “I’m afraid I must ask you to open the top of the urn.”\nWen sucked in a breath of indignation. “Jen,” she protested.\n“There’re many criminals these days,” the Finger said apologetically. “We\nhave to check everyone’s possessions as they board, for weapons and\ncontraband.”\nAnd jade. Euman had many long stretches of unguarded coastline, and\nmost intelligent smugglers would rather risk being caught by the Espenians\nthan by Green Bones.

Wen\ncast a look of deeply convincing insult at the Mountain Finger but let her\ngaze drop quickly. She lifted the glazed lid of the vessel and allowed the man\nto peer inside.\nIf he touched the urn or took it from her to examine it, all was lost. They\nwould not kill her, not right away. The Mountain would find out who she was\nand use her against Hilo. Wen thought, I’ll hurl myself into the harbor. Both\nshe and the urn would sink to the bottom.\nThe young man said, “Go ahead, miss. Forgive my disrespect to you and\nyour grandmother.” He stepped aside to let her board the ferry. Wen replaced\nthe lid of the funeral urn and walked up the gangway onto the boat deck. Her\nface, resettled in an expectedly solemn expression of filial mourning,\nbetrayed none of her relief, just as her body exuded no jade aura. She saw the\nMountain Finger tug his right earlobe as she passed, but it was to ward off\nany spiritual ill will he might have accrued from examining the remains of\nthe deceased, and not because he knew she was a stone-eye. Wen held the urn\ncloser to her chest. She no longer cared how heavy a stigma of bad luck she\ncarried, not if it shielded her and served a purpose. Her deficiency was like a\nmisshapen object, undesirable and unattractive in isolation, that made perfect\nsense when set in the right place.\nThe other people on the boat—commuters, day-trippers, tourists—kept a\nconsiderate distance as she took up a seat near the bow. The ferry whistle\nblew shrilly and the vessel pulled away from the dock. With satisfaction,\nWen watched the waterfront recede. She could’ve chartered a private boat\ninstead of risking this ferry crossing, but then there would be a record with\nthe Maik name on it, one that might be examined if she was stopped and\nsearched by a coast guard patrol. This was more anonymous, the personal\nrisk worth the potential gain.\nWhen Wen disembarked at the small harbor on Euman Island an hour and a\nhalf later, there was a car waiting for her. Shae had arranged it for her ahead\nof time. Euman Island, like Little Button, was not part of Janloon proper, but\nwhile Little Button was a minor independent municipality, Euman was\nessentially run by the Espenians. As soon as the car began driving through\nthe small-town streets, Wen saw shops with signs written in two languages,\ncurrency exchange booths displaying the current conversion rates between\nKekonese dien and Espenian thalirs, shiny foreign chain stores and\nrestaurants, and most conspicuously of all, Espenians on the streets, in and\nout of uniform.\nWen felt as if she’d arrived in another country, someplace that was a\nhybrid of Kekon and what she imagined Espenia would be like. Of course,\none often saw foreigners on the streets of Janloon these days, but nowhere\nnear as many as there were here. Euman Island held twenty-five thousand\nEspenian military personnel, a fact that most Kekonese seemed content to\nignore so long as they remained ensconced on this rocky and wind-blasted"

The clans did not control this place, but so close to\nJanloon, they were far from without influence. The driver of the plain gray\nsedan that picked Wen up opened the door for her respectfully and did not\nask any questions during the drive.\nWen rehearsed what she would say when she arrived. She had not, to her\ngreat regret now, learned much of the Espenian language, and as the car\ndrove past airfields and vistas dotted with silos and wind turbines, she spent\nthe quiet minutes rolling the unfamiliar sounds around in her mouth,\nrepeating what Shae had instructed her to say.\n“Sir, what is your name?” Wen asked the driver.\nThe driver glanced over his shoulder at her. “Me? My name is Sedu.” Mr.\nSedu was a ruddy man with a short beard and callused fingers. Wen never\nforgot a name or face, and she filed Sedu away in her memory. According to\nShae, the man was the son-in-law of a Luckbringer who worked directly\nunder Hami Tumashon and could be counted on to stay quiet. “What do you\ndo, Mr. Sedu?” Wen asked, giving him a smile warm with true curiosity.\n“I’m an electrician,” said the man.\n“Is that a good business to be in?”\n“Ah, pretty good,” Mr. Sedu said, relaxing somewhat. Wen suspected that\nwhen he’d been told to pick up a representative of the clan at the ferry dock\nand speak of the task to no one, Sedu had imagined he would be driving an\nintimidatingly high-rank Green Bone such as Hilo or one of Wen’s brothers.\n“Do you do a lot of work for the Espenians?”\n“Yes, a lot,” Mr. Sedu said. “They have many facilities here and are\nalways needing work done. I have three apprentices now and am looking to\nbring on a fourth. The Espenians pay well, always on time and in thalirs.”\n“You must be very busy. I appreciate you troubling to drive me.”\nMr. Sedu made a dismissive motion, any remaining tension leaving his\nshoulders. “It’s no trouble. One should always provide a favor when possible.\nDifferent foreigners come and go, but the clans will always be here.”\nWen smiled. “Do you speak Espenian well, Mr. Sedu?”\n“Enough to get by. Not as well as my daughter. She wants to go study in\nEspenia, but I wouldn’t trust her to live alone in that country. Espenian men,\nthey do whatever they want, and there are no repercussions.”\n“Will you practice a little Espenian with me now, as we drive?”\nAn hour later, Mr. Sedu’s car pulled up to a gate set in a tall chain-link\nmetal fence topped with security cameras and signed with large, red\nantitrespassing notices. Behind the gate was a sprawling cluster of low, gray-\ngreen buildings. The flag of the Republic of Espenia whipped loudly in the\nisland’s stiff breeze.

Euman’s relentless wind tugged at her clothes and at the\nstern knot in which she’d imprisoned her hair. She breathed slowly to keep\ncalm, more fearful now than when she’d faced the Finger back at the ferry\ndock. From here on in, her success depended entirely on the accurate\njudgment of Kaul Shae. And while she did not doubt the Weather Man’s\nintelligence, Wen did not fully trust the Weather Man herself. Hilo’s sister\nhad turned her back on the family and left Kekon before. What was to stop\nher from doing so again?\nWen had come too far now and had no choice but to put her faith in the\nother woman. She would’ve been even more apprehensive if the Weather\nMan had not, at least, been honest about her misgivings. “Lan’s ghost will\nspit on me for this,” Shae had said, with such gloom that Wen had been a\nlittle surprised. She had always thought of Kaul Shae as remote, even\nunfriendly; she suspected Hilo’s sister must be feeling desperate indeed, to\nconfide in her so.\n“Lan would do anything to save the family. He would be grateful to you\nfor doing the same,” Wen assured her. The ongoing clan war was already\ncourting the risk of Espenian involvement; this was No Peak’s chance to\nmake a move before the Mountain did.\nShae nodded, resigned. “The Espenians aren’t afraid to fight,” she said,\n“but if there’s one thing I know about them, it’s that they believe anything\nthey want can be purchased.”\nA guard with a pistol holstered at his waist came out of the box as Wen\napproached. He began to ask her a question, but Wen interrupted, raising her\nvoice so the Espenian words could be clearly heard over the wind. “Colonel\nDeiller. Please, I speak with Colonel Deiller. I come from Kaul Shaelinsan of\nthe No Peak clan with a message for Colonel Deiller of Espenia.”\nColonel Leland Deiller, the commanding officer of the Republic of Espenia\nSeaborne Infantry at Euman Naval Base, was enjoying a rare moment of\nquiet at his desk after a morning spent on the phone. In the nearly four years\nhe’d been in this post, he’d never before seen so much attention trained on\nthe island of Kekon. His superiors in Adamont Capita were focused on\ncontaining and deterring the growing threat from Ygutan, so as long as\nKekonese jade regularly made its way over the ocean, the top brass was\nsatisfied. That was no longer the case, and Deiller was suddenly getting\nconcerned calls from top generals and even the Secretary of the War\nDepartment.\nThere was a knock at his door. His executive officer, Lt. Colonel Yancey,\nthrust his angular face into the office. “Sir, I think you need to come see\nthis.”\nYancey filled him in as they walked. “A woman showed up an hour ago.\nShe asked for you by name. Claims she’s an emissary of Kaul Shaelinsan.”"

Claims she’s an emissary of Kaul Shaelinsan.”\nThat was a name Deiller had not heard for some time. “Kaul as in the\nJanloon clan family,” he said. “This woman was sent by the granddaughter?”\n“That’s what she says.”\n“I thought Kaul Shaelinsan left the country and emigrated to Espenia.”\n“Apparently she’s returned.” Yancey stopped outside the door of a small\nmeeting room. “You want me to pull everything we have on her?”\n“Do that,” said Deiller. They entered. The woman sitting in the chair was\ndressed in Kekonese mourning attire and held a stone cremation urn on her\nlap.\nThe colonel glanced at his XO questioningly, then back at the unexpected\nvisitor. “I’m Colonel Deiller, the commanding officer here.”\n“My name, Maik Wenruxian,” said the woman, in broken but\nunderstandable Espenian. “Kaul Shaelinsan of the No Peak clan sends\nregards.”\nDeiller said to Yancey, “Can we get a translator in here?” He turned back\nto the woman. She would’ve been checked for any weapons and gone\nthrough the metal detector to get in here, but nevertheless, his eyes fell\nsuspiciously on the urn she was carrying. “And what exactly do you mean by\nthat, Miss Maik?”\nThe woman stood up and removed the lid of the ceramic vessel. To the\ncolonel’s utmost surprise, she tipped the contents onto the table. A stream of\ngray and white ash poured from the mouth of the container. “What in the—”\nDeiller exclaimed, and then he stared as chunks of green rock tumbled from\nthe urn. They clinked together, landing in a dusty pile on the mound of\npowder that had concealed them. The woman emptied out the last stones,\nthen set down the urn and gave a small, smug smile at their flabbergasted\nexpressions. “Jade,” she said.\nYancey whistled. “Must be worth a goddamn fortune.”\n“Call Gavison in here,” said Deiller. “Tell me if those rocks are real\nKekonese jade.”\nThe translator, Mr. Yut, arrived. His eyes nearly bugged out of his head at\nthe sight of the jade on the table. Deiller said to the woman, “Explain why\nyou have so much jade and how you got it here.” Mr. Yut translated his\nquestion.\n“As the Kekon Jade Alliance is under investigation for financial\nirregularities, all mining and export operations have been suspended,\nincluding official jade sales to the Republic of Espenia. We appreciate that\nthis is inconvenient.” The woman paused to let the translator catch up, then\ngestured toward the gemstones spilled on the table. “The No Peak clan has its\nown stores of jade, and the Weather Man would like to discuss establishing a\nconfidential arrangement that would ease this sudden disruption to the\nsupply.”\nDeiller’s eyebrows rose.

Disruption was right; ever since clan warfare had\nerupted in Kekon’s largest city, the military analysts in Adamont Capita had\nbecome increasingly concerned that whichever clan prevailed might assume\nnear absolute political power. That could mean existing contracts with the\nRepublic of Espenia being reneged upon or unfavorably renegotiated. Kekon\nwas vital to the ROE’s military and political strength in the region: It hosted\nseveral Espenian military bases, was a rapidly growing and modernizing\neconomy with historical hatred of Shotar and Tun, and most importantly, it\npossessed the only supply of bioenergetic jade on earth. Deiller had already\nbeen on several calls with his superiors to discuss the potential for military\naction to secure the mines on Kekon if things went further south.\n“Can you prove you’re a representative of the clan?” Deiller asked.\nThe woman’s watchful gaze and the white powder on her face made her\nseem even more coy and aloof than the usual Kekonese female. She inclined\nher head and said, “Kaul Shae asked me to tell you that the cormorant can\nstill fish.”\nAt that moment, Dr. Gavison came into the room. He pulled on lead-lined\ngloves and used metal tongs to pick up one of the green rocks and examine it\nunder a small loupe. He did this with several stones. “Bioenergetic mineral\nstructure, all right,” he declared. “Raw Kekonese jade.”\n“Miss Maik,” said Colonel Deiller. “If you’ll please wait here.”\nThe woman nodded and sat back down. “I wait.”\nSeated in his office behind closed doors, Deiller asked, “How did she\ntransport that much unsecured jade? She’s not one of the aborigines.”\n“She must be nonreactive,” Dr. Gavison said. “It’s a naturally occurring\nbut uncommon genetic trait. The Kekonese call them stone-eyes.”\nYancey handed a file folder to the colonel. “I pulled what we have on\nKaul Shaelinsan. She graduated from Belforte Business School in Windton\nlast spring. Not only is she back in Janloon, she became second-in-command\nof the clan when her eldest brother was assassinated a couple of months ago.”\nDeiller flipped through the pages in the file. There were records and\nphotos of Kaul Shaelinsan from five years ago. As a local informant to the\nROE, she’d done a few impressive and useful things for the Espenian\nmilitary, provided information that would’ve been difficult or impossible to\ngarner otherwise. Deiller had crossed paths with her only once, but he\nrecalled her as an alarming individual, a young woman wearing more jade\nthan a whole navy special ops team. It had made him wonder if the ROE\ncouldn’t recruit more of these killers to their side.\n“Sir, did you notice her code name? Cormorant.’”\n“The cormorant can still fish,” Deiller said, repeating the emissary’s\nwords. He recalled now that Kaul’s work for them had caused some\ncommotion at the time; orders had come swiftly from diplomatic higher-ups\nto terminate her status as a human intelligence asset. That wasn’t to say ties\ncouldn’t be renewed if circumstances had changed. “What of this Maik"

That wasn’t to say ties\ncouldn’t be renewed if circumstances had changed. “What of this Maik\nwoman? Do we know anything about her?”\n“Nothing,” said Yancey. “Except that she has the same family name as\ntwo of the top clan members. The Maik brothers are considered the closest\nadvisors and strongmen of the second Kaul son, who’s now the leader of the\nclan. If she’s telling the truth, she’s probably a sister or a cousin.”\n“She’s got to be high up in a Janloon clan to have access to that kind of\njade,” said Gavison. “That’s not stuff that gets smuggled by criminals—that’s\nhigh-quality, near flawless, bioenergetic Kekonese jade, one of the most\nvaluable substances in the world. The amount she poured out of that urn is\nprobably worth a couple hundred million dien, twenty or thirty million\nthalirs.”\n“How much jade are we losing out on every month with this government\nsuspension?” Yancey wondered. “What’s the long-term risk to the supply?”\nDeiller frowned and turned to his executive officer. “Make sure Miss\nMaik is comfortable and that jade is secured. I don’t want this getting out, so\nhave a talk with Mr. Yut as well. I need to make a call to General Saker in\nAC.”\nCHAPTER\n50\nThe Green Brotherhood\nT\nhe severed head of Lott Penshugon was delivered to the Kaul estate in a\nvegetable crate. Hilo’s howls of rage rang through the courtyard. No one, not\neven Shae, dared to try to comfort him. It was the third of his Fists who’d\nbeen ambushed, murdered, and beheaded in the past three weeks. Lott Pen\nhad not been a pleasant man in life, but Hilo counted him as one of the clan’s\nmost tireless and fearsome lieutenants, a man who, with the right word of\nencouragement, would do anything Hilo asked of him without question.\nThe loss of each good Fist—Lott, Niku, and Trin most recently, but also\nGoun, Obu, Mitto, Asei, Ronu, and Satto—felt to Hilo like a personal wound\ndelivered by Gont Asch directly. The methodical bastard was bleeding out\nNo Peak, killing each of Hilo’s men before he came to Hilo himself.\nIt was some hours before Lott’s jade-stripped, bullet- and blade-torn body\nwas recovered and reunited with his head. It was Maik Kehn’s job to go in\nperson to pay respect and funerary money to Lott’s family, but this was one\nresponsibility of the Horn that Hilo refused to relinquish. When the two of\nthem arrived, Lott’s wife fell upon the ground with noisy sobs. To be honest,\nHilo was not entirely sure if the weeping wasn’t as much relief as grief—he\ndidn’t imagine Lott would’ve been an easy man to live with. Kehn pressed\nthe white envelope into her hand, assuring her that her husband had given his\nblood to the clan, and the clan would always see to the family’s needs. She\nneed not fear her children ever going hungry or homeless."

She\nneed not fear her children ever going hungry or homeless.\nHilo saw four children: a toddler, a six-year-old boy, a girl of about ten,\nand Lott’s teenage son—Anden’s classmate from the Academy, standing\nblank-faced with his younger siblings gathered around him, still in Academy\nuniform from having rushed home upon news of his father’s death. Hilo knelt\nin front of the small children.\n“Do you know who I am?” he asked them.\nThe girl said, “You’re the Pillar.”\n“That’s right,” Hilo said. “I’m here to tell you that your father’s dead. He\ndied because he swore an oath to me, to defend the clan against its enemies.\nThat’s often the way of our kind, to die in this way. I lost my father before I\ncould walk, and I lost my older brother only a few months ago. It’s okay to\nfeel sad or angry, but you should feel proud as well. When you’re older,\nwhen you’ve earned your own jade, you can say, ‘I’m a son or daughter of\nLott Penshugon,’ and other Green Bones will salute you with respect,\nbecause of today.”\nThen he stood and spoke to Lott’s son. “Are Trials over at the Academy?”\nThe young man roused his attention to Hilo slowly, as if emerging from a\nwaking stupor. “Yes,” he said at last. “They finished yesterday.”\nHilo nodded. The graduation ceremony wouldn’t occur until after New\nYear’s Festival week, once final ranks had been determined and graduates\nhad declared which oaths they intended to take, but excepting ceremony, the\nboy was a man now, the head of this Green Bone family. “I’m sorry you\nwon’t be celebrating the end of Trials, or the New Year.” Hilo’s voice held an\nundercurrent of sympathy, but it had the rough tone he would take with any\nof his own men under formal circumstances. “A representative of the clan\nwill be here soon, to help arrange your father’s funeral. If there’s anything\nyou need from us, Lott-jen, anything at all, you call the Horn directly, and if\nyou can’t reach him, you call the house and leave a message for me.”\nThe young man’s face moved in a brief contortion. He hadn’t missed the\nway Hilo had addressed him as a fellow Green Bone and a member of the\nclan. He glanced over at his collapsed mother and down at the small siblings\nhuddled around him. Hilo watched the youth’s eyes, which had been full of\nscorn and resentment during their first encounter, slowly clear of their\nstunned confusion and resolve into dark acceptance, into blackness of\npurpose.\n“Thank you for your generosity, Kaul-jen,” he said, speaking like a man,\nand he raised clasped hands to his head, bending deeply in salute.\nAs they left the house, Hilo said to Kehn, “That young man is our brother\nnow. We have to take care of him and bring him up right in the clan, like his\nfather would’ve wanted. Start thinking about how best to do it. Maybe put\nhim under Vuay—he’s a good mentor.”"

Maybe put\nhim under Vuay—he’s a good mentor.”\nHilo’s specific beliefs about what was required in a leader of Green Bones\ncould be traced to a day some thirteen years ago, when the Maik brothers had\nbeen ambushed and set upon by a pack of six Academy boys and Kehn had\nhad his cheek badly broken.\nHilo had not taken any special notice of the Maiks before then. Even\nthough he and Tar were year-four classmates, they were not friends. The\nMaik brothers had few, if any, friends. They stuck together a great deal, as\neveryone was aware that they came from a shameful family. One day, a snide\nremark caused Tar to attack and beat another boy, and even though he was\npunished by the instructors, the boy’s friends, Hilo included, took it upon\nthemselves to wait until they had a chance to catch the Maiks off Academy\ngrounds.\nThe brothers put up a ferocious defense. Hilo hung back; the boy being\navenged, Uto, would later become one of his Fists but was not at the time a\nclose friend of his, so Hilo felt it was rightfully the place of others to take the\ngreater share of the feud. After a while, though, he felt the Maiks had been\nthrough enough. The fight continued only because Tar had not suffered\nmuch. Kehn, two years older and larger, had taken the brunt of the attack and\ndelivered impressive damage in return.\nKehn’s refusal to yield cost him; he was finally struck so hard that he fell\nmoaning to his knees with his hands over his damaged face. Tar’s eyes\nclouded over with rage, and he pulled a talon knife from seemingly nowhere.\nThis caused all the boys to stop. Up until now, unspoken rules had been\nfollowed—only fists and feet were involved and there’d been no pinning or\nbeating on the ground. The appearance of a knife signaled that the fight had\nturned potentially deadly, and it put all of them at risk for expulsion from the\nAcademy. A ripple of uncertain menace went through the group.\nHilo did not like how things were going, so he called out, “We’re done.”\nAt that time, he held sway with the group, but not so much that they\nobeyed him in the heat of a moment like this. “We’re not done,” Asei\nretorted. “We have to teach these two a lesson. They can’t be trusted.”\n“Why do you say that?” Hilo asked curiously, for he admired the Maik\nbrothers now after seeing how well they fought and how fiercely they\ndefended each other. He envied the bond they had, and with a pang felt that it\nwas something he lacked, not having a brother of a similar age. Lan had\ngraduated from the Academy the year after Hilo entered.\n“Everyone knows it about them,” Asei insisted.\n“I’m not done either,” Tar snarled.

Hilo suspected he did not care if he was\nexpelled for murder.\n“If we’re here on account of Uto, then we’re done,” Hilo said, still\nspeaking to Asei. “If you’ve got some other grief with the Maiks, you\nshould’ve said so earlier. I don’t know of any myself, does anyone else?”\n“That’s easy for you to say,” retorted another boy, who was cupping a\nhand to his bleeding nose. “I didn’t see you doing much of the fighting, Kaul;\nthe rest of us did it for you, and we’ve still got grief, all right.” A moment\npassed before anyone seemed to realize that the boy, Yew, had said\nsomething wrong. A dangerous light had come into Hilo’s eyes.\n“All right,” he said at last, and though his voice had gone quiet, he was\neasily heard in the alleyway’s sudden silence. “I can’t argue with Yew; I\nshouldn’t suggest what we ought to do if I haven’t suffered as much as the\nrest of you. And it’s also not fair that Kehn and Tar should have to keep\nfighting two against six when they’ve already been punished and can’t help\nthat their family is hated by everyone.\n“I’ll fight the Maiks; if the two of them can beat me, that’ll settle the\nmatter for both Tar and Yew here.” Hilo shrugged out of his jacket and\nhanded it to Yew. “No one else jumps in, or I’ll have words with you myself,\nanother day.” Everyone looked skeptical, though also undisguisedly eager;\nthis was a good matchup. The Maiks were fearsome and Kehn was large, but\nthey were both tired and injured. Hilo was fresh, and he was a Kaul—no one\nwho wanted to stay in the good graces of that family would dare to really hurt\nhim, but the Maiks had no reputation to lose.\nHilo looked at Kehn’s battered face and Tar’s maddened one. “Put away\nthe talon knife,” he said, as simply as if he were asking Tar to close a\nwindow. “I’ll give you three blows to even things up. I won’t answer the first\nthree. After that, I will.”\nThe Maiks did not argue. The first three blows—two of Kehn’s huge fists\nto the stomach and a third to the face—nearly knocked Hilo unconscious. He\nclimbed to his feet, wheezing through tears of pain, and began to fight back.\nAt first, the circle of onlookers cheered and jeered, but they quickly fell\nsilent. The trio of fighters were having a difficult time—all three were soon\nstaggering exhausted as if drunk, and none of them bore real hatred for the\nother side—yet they kept battling on through a bullheaded, adolescent sense\nof perceived honor. In a matchup of jade powers, Hilo would’ve prevailed,\nbut in a blunt physical contest, he could not hope to win. The Maik brothers\nhad fought together too many times, and Kehn was too strong.\nIn the end, seeing Tar gasping and barely able to stand, but readying to hit\nhim in the mouth again, Hilo broke into a bloody grin.

He bent over,\ncoughing with laughter that rattled his bruised ribs, and Tar, after staring at\nhim nonplussed for a second, began to laugh himself, until he fell against the\nbrick wall. Kehn scowled. As half his face was frozen from his injury, he\nlooked like a ghoul as he went, not first to his younger brother, but to Hilo,\nand offered him a hand to help him upright. The three of them left holding\neach other up, the other five boys shuffling bewildered a respectful distance\nbehind them, and returned to the Academy, where Hilo and the Maiks were\nassigned to clean the Academy’s toilets together every day for the next three\nmonths.\nLooking back now, Hilo shook his head at the stupidity of fifteen-year-old\nboys, but after that, no one spoke badly of the Maiks to their faces, not unless\nthey wished to challenge Kaul Hilo, which they did not.\nWith the death of Lott senior, Hilo was not optimistic about No Peak’s\nchances of holding Sogen. Most of it was already lost and the violence was\nspilling into Old Town, which only a few weeks ago he would’ve counted as\na No Peak stronghold.\nHe strategized gloomily with Kehn in the car as they drove to the Cong\nLady, which had become one of the clan’s primary meeting locations and was\nconstantly occupied by the Horn’s men. Hilo personally preferred the food in\nthe Double Double, but there was fire damage to the kitchen and no point in\nrepairing it during a street war when they might lose the property again. They\narrived to receive another terrible shock. One of the Fingers rushed through\nthe door and down the front steps as soon as they stepped out of the\nDuchesse. “It’s Eiten,” the young man gasped, his face a sickly hue.\nTrembling, he led them into the betting house and down the stairs.\nThe silent crowd of Fingers in the hallway parted, pressing against the\nwalls as Hilo and Kehn came through. Eiten was lying, moaning, on a black\nleather sofa in the basement lounge. Both of his arms were missing, chopped\noff, the stumps at the shoulders cauterized. Someone had brought Dr. Truw.\nThe portly Green Bone physician was bent over, hands on the man’s chest,\nChanneling into him. Eiten wept, “No, stop, get off me,” twisting his armless\ntorso to try to push the doctor off. As Hilo stared down, shaken at the sight,\nDr. Truw stood and wiped his perspiring brow. “That should keep him alive\nuntil he gets to a hospital. An ambulance is on the way.”\n“Hilo-jen,” Eiten sobbed, and Hilo crouched next to him. “Help me,\nplease. He wouldn’t give me a clean death, wouldn’t even give me the respect\nhe at least gave Lott and Satto. He sent me back alive to give you a message.”\nHilo bent near Eiten’s face. “What was Gont’s message?”\nEiten’s gray eyes burned with fury. He looked as if he’d spit if only he"

It’s insulting, not even worth\nyou hearing.”\n“That disgraceful piss drinker crippled you for this message,” Hilo said.\n“Tell me what it is, Eiten. I promise on my brother’s grave I’ll take Gont’s\njade for you.”\nStill, the man hesitated, his bloodless face slick with sweat. “Gont says\nhe’ll give you until the end of New Year’s Day to surrender yourself. If you\ndo, he’ll grant you a death of consequence, on your feet and with a blade, and\nlet your family bury you with your jade. The rest of No Peak will be spared if\nthey can choose allegiance to the Mountain or exile from Kekon.” Eiten drew\na difficult breath. “If you refuse, Gont promises to keep sending you the\nheads of your Fists, and he’ll do worse to Anden and Shae-jen than what he’s\ndone to me. He means to burn the Torch’s house to the ground and destroy\nthe clan completely.”\nEiten saw murder sweeping across the Pillar’s eyes, and he lifted his head\nin sudden urgency. “End my life, Hilo-jen, and take my jade for the clan. I’m\nuseless to you now. I’m a Green Bone, a Fist of No Peak. I can’t live like\nthis. Please …”\nKehn made an inarticulate noise of agreement behind the Pillar.\nHilo’s fog of wrath cleared long enough for him to lean forward and place\na hand on the man’s brow. “No, Eiten. Right now, you’re humiliated and in\npain. You shouldn’t make the decision to die in this state. All you’re missing\nare your arms. There are good prosthetics these days; the Espenians make\nthem. You still have a sharp mind, and your training, and your jade abilities.\nAnd a wife—you have a beautiful wife, and a baby growing in her belly. You\nshouldn’t die if you can help it.”\n“She can’t see me like this,” Eiten sobbed. “I can’t let her.”\nHilo turned to Pano, the Finger who’d brought them in. “Go tell Eiten-\njen’s wife that he’s been hurt. Make sure she stays at home, until he’s ready\nto see her. Get her whatever she needs, comfort her that he’ll be all right, but\nmake her stay at home. Go now.”\nHe turned back to Eiten as Pano rushed off to do as he asked. “You should\nlive to see your child be born. And wouldn’t you like to be alive when I tear\nthe jade from Gont’s body, on your behalf?” Uncertainty slackened Eiten’s\nface. Hilo said, “A new year is around the corner, so I’ll tell you what: Give it\none year, so you can see these good things coming to you. At the end of this\nnext year, if you still want to die, come talk to me. I’ll honor your wishes\nmyself, without question. I’ll see that you’re buried with your jade and that\nyour wife and child are taken care of.”"

I’ll see that you’re buried with your jade and that\nyour wife and child are taken care of.”\nTears rolled from the corners of Eiten’s eyes and pooled under his head on\nthe black leather under the bright lights of the casino. “Do you promise, Hilo-\njen?”\n“On my brother’s grave, just as I said.”\nSlowly, Eiten’s breathing eased. His jade aura calmed, the shrill spikes of\ndesperation and pain ceasing. When the ambulance arrived, Hilo stepped\naway to let Dr. Truw and the paramedics take the man away. Kehn went out\nto speak to the ambulance driver to make sure the Fist was taken straight to\nJanloon General in the Temple District and not any of the lesser hospitals.\nWhen Kehn returned, Hilo asked everyone else in the room and the hallway\nto leave. They did so in a solemn hush.\nHilo poured two shots of hoji from behind the bar and put one of them in\nfront of Kehn. “Drink,” he said, and downed his own glass. The liquor burned\nhis throat and warmed his stomach, settling his taut nerves. When Kehn set\nhis glass down, Hilo said, “Shame on you, Kehn. It was a good thing I was\nhere.”\nKehn was taken aback. “What did I do?”\n“You would’ve killed Eiten like he asked.”\n“It seemed the merciful thing to do. It was what he wanted.”\n“To make his wife a widow and for his child to be fatherless? No, what he\nwanted was his dignity. I promised him that. Now we don’t have to bury\nanother Fist. We’ve lost too many people as it is.” He rested his forehead in\nhis hands for a moment. Nine of his best Fists slain, and one horribly\nmaimed. Dozens of his Fingers dead or crippled. Hilo looked up at Kehn. “I\nexpect you to honor my promise to Eiten if I’m not alive to do it. You need to\ntell Juen about this, Vuay too, so one of them can honor it if you’re not\nalive.”\nKehn nodded, but he looked frustrated. It was unlike him; he was usually\nstalwart even in dire situations. It was Tar who would show his emotions,\nwho would vent on behalf of both of them. Now, however, Kehn’s soldierly\ncomposure was visibly fissured. He understood all too well how badly the\nwar was going and how that failure could in large part be laid at his feet. The\nelder Maik’s tired face was rigid with the baleful desperation that Hilo\nremembered so well from that first memorable encounter when they were\nboth teenagers. “I wouldn’t have thought of saying what you did to Eiten just\nnow,” Kehn said in a gruff voice. “I can’t do what you do, Hilo-jen.”\n“You have to learn to be the Horn. I’m giving you a hard time, I know. If\nLan were here, he’d be tearing into me for everything I’m doing wrong as\nPillar.”\n“But he’s not here,” Kehn said, and Hilo heard the resentment, realized"

        "text": "Lan were here, he’d be tearing into me for everything I’m doing wrong as\nPillar.”\n“But he’s not here,” Kehn said, and Hilo heard the resentment, realized\nthat Kehn saw the difficulty inherent in his position so long as every jade\nwarrior in the clan still looked to Hilo as the true Horn when he entered the\nroom. There was nothing to be done for it, though, not with the stakes so\nhigh. He had confidence that given autonomy and time to find his footing,\nKehn would be more than capable as Horn, but Hilo was also grimly aware\nthat he couldn’t afford to step away right now. A wartime Horn needed not\nonly the respect but the love of his men, needed empathy in addition to\ncunning and resolve. As No Peak’s position became increasingly dire, it\nbecame more and more important that the Green Bones saw him among them\nand kept faith.\n“Soon I may not be here either,” Hilo said somberly.\nKehn’s head jerked up, the frown on his face sharp. “You’re not thinking\nof giving in to Gont’s threats?” When Hilo didn’t answer, alarm began\nforming on the Horn’s face. “Like Eiten said, it’s an insult, not worth\nlistening to. Does Gont actually think you’d hand yourself over like a sheep\nto the butcher? We’ve killed many of theirs, and he’s trying to scare our\nFingers with what he did to Eiten.”\n“Maybe,” said Hilo, but he didn’t think Gont was so superficial. No, the\nman must be aware of the important fact that Shae had told Hilo and that\nKehn did not yet know: Based on respective clan resources, the Mountain\nwould eventually win the war. But it would take time and be bloody and\ncostly to both sides. The Mountain would be a weak and gutted victor by the\nend, perhaps unable to manage all its territories or maintain the support of its\nLantern Men and the Royal Council. Smaller tributary clans might break\naway. The jade smuggling and SN1 manufacturing businesses Ayt had built\nwould be at risk from takeover by criminals and foreigners.\n“He’s trying to force an end to this,” Hilo muttered. Even if the Mountain\nwas better financially girded for prolonged war, it had to be worried about\nlosing the support of the people in its districts. Ordinary jadeless citizens\nneed not fear being active targets of Green Bone violence, but sometimes\nthere were collateral casualties, and property and economic damage were\ninevitable. Once the Academy graduates joined No Peak in the spring, the\nconflict would surge further, and the city would suffer more. On top of that,\ngiven public censure from the audit of the Kekon Jade Alliance and the\npending passage of oversight legislation, the Mountain surely wanted to\nsecure victory soon. Once it did, Chancellor Son would be out of power, and\nAyt Mada could pressure the Royal Council to drop the issue.\nLook at me, Hilo thought wryly. Actually thinking about all the political\nbullshit. Perhaps he was learning, gradually, to be a Pillar after all. Too little,\ntoo late, though. Politics moved slowly and blades moved fast.\n“Gont won’t intimidate us with crude savagery,” Kehn insisted, pouring"

Politics moved slowly and blades moved fast.\n“Gont won’t intimidate us with crude savagery,” Kehn insisted, pouring\nthem both another shot of hoji. “Every Green Bone down to the lowest Finger\nwould give his life for you, jen. Gont wants a quick victory? He won’t get\nanything of the sort.”\nHilo had never shied away from any fight, and he was willing to wage a\nlong and brutal war if that was what was required to overcome his enemies.\nBut if defeat was on the inevitable horizon, then he held no pointless desire\nfor any more of his Fists or Fingers to lose their limbs or their jade. He would\nvalue a clean death for himself and his loved ones. It was, in truth, not so bad\na trade Gont was offering him.\nThe idea of dying for the clan was not rhetoric to Hilo. The clan was an\nextension of family, in some ways more family to Hilo than his own kin. He\nhad never known his father. His mother had loved Lan; his grandfather had\nloved Shae. Hilo had found his place in the world among peers—that was\nwhere his expressiveness and daring were valued. Now the clan was relying\non him in a very real and personal way: Kehn and Tar, his other Fists like\nJuen and Vuay, poor Eiten and Satto and Lott who deserved their vengeance,\nall the way down to the Fingers like Pano and that kid, Hejo, who’d\nunflinchingly risked his life by going into the Factory at Hilo’s command,\nand future clan members like Lott’s son and Anden. He asked them all to\noffer up their lives for the brotherhood; he would never ask less of himself.\nHilo swirled his glass and drank, then took the bottle and put it behind the\nbar before Kehn could reach for any more. A Horn could never afford to have\nhis wits addled. “Kehn,” Hilo said, “if I die, you’ll want to avenge me and\ntake back my jade from Gont or whoever kills me. That’s natural, but I don’t\nwant you to do that. I’d rather you took care of Wen. Make sure she has a\ngood life, a good home. That’s more important to me, even if you have to\nleave Kekon, even if you have to turn.”\nKehn was aghast. “I would never swear oaths to the Mountain. Never.”\nAnd Hilo remembered it wasn’t just loyalty to him that drove the Horn’s\nvehemence, but the fact that the Mountain had executed Kehn and Tar’s\nfather and cast his family into disgrace. The Horn’s voice shook as he said,\n“Why are you talking like this, Hilo-jen?”\nHilo said, “I just want my wishes to be clear.” Then he walked to the\ndoor. “We need to talk to the guys upstairs; they’re waiting for us. And then\nwe’ll drive to see Eiten’s wife before we go to Sogen to sort out who will\ntake Lott’s place there.”\nTHIRD INTERLUDE\nBaijen’s Triumph\nI\nn Kekonese religious mythology, Old Uncle Jenshu, the One Who\nReturned, had a favorite nephew named Baijen, who remains the country’s"

Stories of Baijen, the courageous\nGreen Bone warrior, have been told to Kekonese children for hundreds of\nyears, and more recently, comic books and films have recounted his\nadventures and deeds. Unlike his divine uncle Jenshu, however, Baijen\nremains a mortal champion and is not worshipped as a god.\nAccording to legend, when Baijen was finally slain in furious battle\nagainst his greatest foe, the invading Tuni General Sh’ak, he was recognized\nby the gods for his valor and accorded a place in Heaven. From his vantage\npoint in the divine realm, Baijen looked down upon the Earth. He witnessed\nhis remaining men fighting and dying in his name, and saw that his people\nwere on the verge of being conquered. He watched, helpless, as his beloved,\ngrief-stricken wife prepared to throw herself from the cliff before the\noncoming army could reach their mountainside home.\nIn a panic, Baijen begged the gods to allow him to return to Earth for one\nnight and give up his place in Heaven to another. At first, his request was\nrefused, but Baijen was immovable in his pleas. He wailed and beat his head\non the steps of the jade palace, refusing to be deterred until Yatto, the Father\nof All, taking pity on him, agreed.\nThe fallen warrior fell at the feet of the gods and wept in gratitude. That\nvery night, he returned to Earth, sweeping over the battlefields littered with\nbodies, and entered the tent of the Tuni general. He burst in upon his shocked\nenemy and, laughing in triumph, killed him where he stood in his\nunderclothes.\nIn accordance with the pact Baijen had made with the gods, the soul of\nGeneral Sh’ak flew to Heaven. Baijen, the savior of his people, was left to\nroam the Earth as an exiled spirit for all eternity.\nGreen Bones have an old saying: Pray to Jenshu, but be like Baijen.\nCHAPTER\n51\nNew Year’s Eve\nP\nreparations for New Year’s week were muted in Janloon; the city expected\nfew out-of-town visitors this year, and locals were not in a festive mood. The\ntwo major clans, which normally each donated a considerable sum to public\ncelebrations and charitable events during this season, were too besieged to\narrange anything except minor community functions in their largest and most\nsecurely held districts. On every New Year’s Eve day in Janloon that Shae\ncould remember, the Kaul family, led by their grandfather and later by Lan,\nwould be out in public in the Temple District, lighting fireworks, handing out\ncandy coins to children, and accepting a stream of well wishes from Lantern\nMen. This year, she and Hilo sat alone at the patio table in the courtyard of\nthe Kaul house, where they’d spent all night in discussion.\nThere was almost nothing left to talk about now. Shae watched the rising\nsun smear the clouds with streaks of red over the roof of the house. In forty-\neight hours, she might be the short-lived Pillar of a clan in its death throes."

In forty-\neight hours, she might be the short-lived Pillar of a clan in its death throes.\nHer duties at that point would be relatively simple: see to the proper burial of\nher brother, the safety of her remaining family members, and a somewhat\norderly transition of power in exchange for a swift and honorable death for\nherself. Minimizing further bloodshed would be the most difficult part. There\nwould be those who’d rather fight on, no matter how hopelessly. She was in\npossession of sealed letters from Hilo to each of his top Fists in his own\nhandwriting, should it come to that. She’d leave the more difficult\nconversation with the Maiks to Hilo.\nAfter a spell of silence, Hilo said, “I haven’t thanked you for giving Wen\nthat new job.”\n“It was no trouble,” Shae said. “She gave me a good idea of what she\nwanted.” Wen’s official new job was working for the Weather Man’s office\nas a design consultant on real estate development projects. It required a fair\namount of travel.\n“I’m glad to see the two of you getting along,” Hilo said.\n“I’ve gotten to know her better.”\nHilo smiled faintly. Shae thought he looked weary and a little distant.\nHow these past months had eroded the boyishness of his face, damaged the\nease and openness of his manner. He said, “The family was hard on you at\nthe time, but now I’m glad for your Espenian connections. I don’t know how\nyou pulled it off, but however you did, I’m grateful.” He squinted into the\nsunrise. “You said we needed two things to survive: money and a military\nvictory. You delivered the first one, faster than I could get the second. You\nalways were one up on me like that.”\nShe wished they could think of something else, some other way. Hilo’s\ndecision was awful—she’d told him so several times. But in the end, he was\nthe Pillar, and also the Horn, in spirit if not in title, and she had no basis on\nwhich to argue, no superior plan or more cunning ruse, like she’d had on\nPoor Man’s Road. She’d done all she could—more than she could ever in\ngood conscience admit to either of her brothers—to diminish the Mountain’s\nadvantage over them, but it was still not enough. This might be their only\nchance, and at last she agreed they had no choice but to take it. “This is a\nterrible gamble,” she said.\n“So was you meeting with Ayt.”\nShae’s face jerked up. When he saw that he’d unbalanced her, the smile\non Hilo’s face broadened and he looked more like himself.\n“Have you been spying on me?” Even now, he could surprise and\naggravate her with his arrogance. “Having Caun follow me around again?”\nHilo’s smile fell off his face. “Caun Yu is dead. He was killed at the\nTwice Lucky when Gont and his men took it.”\nShae stilled.

I figured Ayt\nwould contact you, that she’d try to convince you to kill me.” He shrugged\none shoulder. “It makes sense. It’s what I would do if I were her.”\nShae sat back. “You never brought it up. You weren’t even worried?”\nHer brother laughed a little. “Ah, Shae, if you decided to betray me, what\ncould I do? What’s the point of life if you can’t even trust your own kin?” He\nkicked her foot under the table, a teasing, childish gesture. “For you to hand\nmy head over to the Mountain, you must really hate me. I must be such a\nterrible brother that I’d deserve to die. So there was nothing to be done about\nit.”\nThat was the way it was with Hilo; it always came down to the deeply\npersonal for him. Shae stood up. “I need to move; I’m stiff from sitting so\nlong. Do you need to go, or will you walk in the garden with me for a few\nminutes?”\n“A few minutes,” he said, and got up to accompany her.\nWen was right, the garden was the most beautiful part of the Kaul estate,\nand she’d never really paused to appreciate it. The morning light was slightly\nfoggy, illuminating the still pond and the late winter blooms: bright pink\ncherry tree blossoms draped over dense shrubs laden with sprays of small\nwhite berries. Hilo crushed one of them between his fingers. “If you play\nyour cards right, Ayt might let you out,” he said. “Exile wouldn’t be so bad\nfor you. There’s plenty you could do elsewhere.” Faint bitterness in his voice.\n“I’d feel better about it.”\nShae thought of the meeting she’d had with Ayt Mada in the sanctum and\nhow it had ended. “No,” she said with grim confidence, “I don’t think that\nwill happen.” By dramatic and inexorable steps, she’d given up her chance at\nthat other destiny; she’d hovered, gazing through that open door, and then\nshe’d turned away. She was surprised to find, even faced with the probability\nof ruin and death, that she felt no great regret. At first, her decisions had been\nabout herself, then they had been about honoring and avenging Lan, and in\nthe end, they had been about more than that. She could say to the gods on the\nday of the Return that she had finally been the Green Bone she’d wanted to\nbe: seeking if never achieving the Divine Virtues, but true to family and\ncountry and aisho.\nShe and Hilo kept walking, in a more companionable silence than she\nsuspected they had ever before shared in their lives.

So Ayt had been telling the truth. No Green\nBone would’ve left jade on the body of a slain foe. Her brother had not been\nkilled by an enemy warrior. “His death was an accident,” she whispered in\nanguish.\n“It was no accident.” Hilo’s voice was cutting. He took a step toward\nShae, his aura flaring harsh and bright in a tempest of sudden emotion. She’d\nnever seen him look more dangerous than he did in that single step. He spoke\nwith slow, deathly intensity. “There were two machine guns on the pier, and\na dead man, a teenager. Ayt and Gont sent at least two men after Lan that\nnight. One of them got away, and if I’m still alive when Tar finds him, I’ll\nforce a jade stone down his throat and bury him alive to die slowly of the\nItches. Don’t doubt, not for a single second, that the Mountain killed our\nbrother.”\n“By sending a couple of jadeless thugs?” she cried.\nHilo’s breaths were growing hard, as if he’d run some great distance. He\ntook hold of his sister by the arms, his grip fierce, though she didn’t resist,\nonly stood limply, staring at him. “Lan was weak that night, Shae. He’d been\nbadly hurt by Gam in the duel at the Factory, but he didn’t let on. He was\ncarrying too much jade, trying to stay strong in front of the clan. I ordered an\nautopsy done, that I never told anyone about. There was shine in his blood,\nShae, too much of it. Shine! Lan hated the stuff, he would never have taken it,\nbut he must’ve thought he had no choice.”\nHe released her abruptly and stepped back, his eyes black coals of\nimplacable hatred. “The Mountain always intended to conquer us. They\nbroke us down, threatened and hounded us, ruined a good peacetime Pillar\nlike Lan. It doesn’t matter what happened that night, they’re the reason he’s\ndead. I’ll risk everything tomorrow to set straight that score.”\n“You misled me that day,” Shae said, but there was no anger in her words,\nonly bitter grief and acceptance. She felt, strangely, that it all made sense in a\nperfect and terrible way. It only confirmed in her mind that the will of the\ngods was a conspiracy of many things; people laid the tracks of their fate yet\nwere helpless at the same time. They’d all played their part in this—them and"

They’d all played their part in this—them and\ntheir enemies. “The Mountain didn’t even know Lan was dead when we\nattacked Poor Man’s Road. We were the ones who came down from the\nforest first; we slaughtered twenty-one unsuspecting people.”\n“Misled you?” Hilo’s eyes were pits. “Never. You came back on your\nown, Shae, without a word from me, and thank the gods you did. As for those\npeople—they were Green Bones. No Green Bone is unsuspecting of death.”\nCHAPTER\n52\nFrom Now Until the Last\nT\nhat afternoon, Hilo went into the house and changed into his best suit. On\nhis way out, he paused in front of the closed door of Kaul Sen’s room. Om\nsaluted and stood aside to let him enter, but Hilo didn’t go in. He stared at the\nblank door, Perceiving his grandfather’s slow but steady heartbeat beyond it,\nhis raspy breath, the weak texture of his aura, so shadowy now that he was\ndown to almost no jade at all. The old man was napping in his chair. He’s\ntolerable when he’s asleep, Hilo thought.\nAs stunned and enraged as he’d been and still was, Hilo admitted that the\nact of giving jade to Doru to enable the traitor to escape was the most himself\nthat the Torch had been in months. Sneaky and subversive, unbending,\nrighteous in his principled fury. Right now, it wouldn’t surprise Hilo if the\npatriarch claimed the final victory and misfortune of outliving all his\ngrandchildren. Hilo put a hand on the door but could think of nothing to be\ngained from going in. He turned and went down the stairs, exited the house,\nand walked the short path over to the Horn’s residence.\nWhen Wen opened the door and saw him dressed so formally, she backed\naway from him and put her hands to her chest, bending as if in pain. She\ntrembled as he stepped in the house and put his arms around her. “You’ve\ndecided to go,” she said.\n“Yes,” he said. “We have to be married today.”\nEven though he’d prepared her for this possibility, she let out a desolate\nnoise and sagged against him slightly. “This isn’t how I’d imagined it at all.”\n“Me neither.” He pressed the side of his face to the top of her silken head\nand closed his eyes. “I was imagining the biggest banquet and the best food.\nA live band. And you, looking lovely with your hair done up and walking\nwith your hand on my arm, in a long green dress. Or red, I like red just as\nwell. I’d especially like it if the dress had a high collar, in a traditional style\nthat’s elegant and modest, but then also had a slit up the thigh to show off\nwhat a sexy piece you are.”\n“I already picked out the dress,” she warned him.\n“Keep it hidden,” he said. “Don’t show it to me yet. We might still have\neverything we planned for—the banquet, the guests, the music—everything.\nLater.”\n“We will,” she said. “You’ll come back after you’ve done what you need\nto.”"

Shae has\nEspenian connections; I don’t know how she managed to do this, but she’s\narranged visas for you, your brothers, Grandda, and Anden. She’ll get all of\nyou out of the Mountain’s reach.”\n“Kehn and Tar won’t go,” Wen said.\n“I’ve ordered them to. They can’t stand the idea of running, but in this\ncase, they’re sure to die if they stay. Better to live for a chance to settle the\nscore later. You’ll have to remind them, and hold them to my orders, if it\ncomes to that.”\n“If it comes to that,” Wen said. “I don’t think it will.”\n“I don’t think so either,” he assured her. “It’s still important, though, that\nwe get married today, just in case.”\n“Just in case,” she agreed. She rubbed the gathering of tears from her eyes\nand stepped out of his embrace. “I’ll get changed. Give me a few minutes.”\nHe sat down in the front room and waited, thinking, as he looked around,\nthat this really was a nice house, that he would’ve enjoyed living in it with\nher, the way it was now. Wen returned a few minutes later, wearing makeup,\na soft, pretty blue dress, and a pearl necklace and earrings. Hilo smiled and\nstood to offer her his arm, and they went out into the courtyard to be wed.\nJudge Ledo, a man well trusted and paid by the clan, had been summoned\nto officiate the marriage. Kehn and Shae stood as witnesses. The civil\nceremony took only a few minutes, not the hour or more of chanting that\nwould’ve been involved under Deitist tradition, but the legal marriage vows\nstill harkened to the Divine Virtues.\nI will practice humility: putting my beloved before myself, expecting no\npraise or reward, for now we are joined in all things.\nI will practice compassion: giving gratitude for my beloved, suffering\nwhen they suffer, for now we are joined in all things.\nI will practice courage: protecting my beloved from harm, facing all fears\nfrom within or without, for now we are joined in all things.\nI will practice goodness: offering freely of myself to my beloved, honoring\nand caring for each other in body and soul, for now we are joined in all\nthings.\nI make this pledge to you and you alone, under the eyes of the gods in\nHeaven, from this moment until the last one of my life.\nWen’s expression weakened, fighting tears, as Hilo repeated after Judge\nLedo, reciting the final words. From this moment until the last one of my life.\nHow long would that be? Hilo felt the vows settle into him, binding him with\na different power than the clan oaths that had directed his entire adult life.\nAlready he felt a curious compulsion to try to reconcile the two sets of\npledges, sensing the impossibilities he’d encounter in the attempt.

Gazing at\nWen’s lovely, trusting face, he was struck with remorse that he couldn’t, even\nwith the consuming love he felt for her, promise not to break her heart.\nBecause there were times a man couldn’t be loyal to a brother and\ncompassionate to his wife at the same time. A jade warrior couldn’t truly be\njoined in all things with his beloved, not when he’d promised his blood to the\nclan.\nWen took a steadying breath and said her vows with a strength that made\nhim admire and appreciate her all the more. Kehn stepped forward to tie their\nwrists together with strips of cloth, right to left on each side as they faced\neach other, and Shae placed the cup of hoji in their joined hands. They both\ndrank from it, then poured it on the ground to call forth good luck. Judge\nLedo pronounced them married.\nHilo knew it was a poor wedding for the Pillar of the clan. He was deeply\nsorry for having robbed Wen of the grand and joyful occasion she deserved.\nBut the important thing was that she was his wife now, and if she became his\nwidow tomorrow, she’d have everything he’d promised to leave her. The\nMountain couldn’t touch assets bequeathed to family members through wills.\nWen would have enough to start up a new life, a safer life, in Espenia. And\nfor now at least, he was her husband, and that made him happy, happier than\nhe’d been in a long time.\nHe took Wen to the main house and up to his room, where he shut the\ndoor and undressed her and made love to her. They kept the soft lamplight on\nand took turns guiding each other, not speaking in words but with the silent\nbrushing of skin across skin, the contact of fingertips and mouths, the\nmerging of breaths. Hilo ached to stretch this oasis of time to its breaking\npoint; whenever he crested toward climax, he denied himself and turned his\nattention to Wen instead, until she was spent with pleasure and whispering\nsweetly for him to give in. At last, with fierce desperation and quivering\nreluctance, he found release, and afterward tried to stay awake long enough to\nburn the merciful moment so indelibly into his mind that he could be certain\nit would be the last thing he would remember.\nCHAPTER\n53\nBrothers-In-Arms\nA\nnden arrived at the Kaul house late in the evening on New Year’s Eve.\nThe Academy had let out for the holiday week, and throughout the day\nstudents had been departing campus to spend the break with their families.\nAnden had been slow to pack his bags and leave. The Pillar had spoken to\nhim at length the day before, so he knew what to expect when he arrived, but\nfor much of the day he hadn’t felt ready to face what lay next. Instead, he\nwalked the grounds of the Academy, trying to soak in the feeling of the home\nthat he would soon be leaving. For many years, he’d thought of the Academy\nas a place of necessary hardship and tribulation, of sweat and chores, of\nmodest meals, little leisure, and unsympathetic masters. Now, though, he"

Now, though, he\nrealized that it was a haven, a refuge where Green Bone honor was an\nuntainted goal, the only place where a person could wear jade and practice\nthe jade disciplines in true safety.\nThe two weeks of final Trials had passed in a blur. After so many years of\npreparation and feverish last-minute studying and training, the conclusion of\nacademic and martial testing had seemed almost anticlimactic to Anden. He’d\nbeen most worried about his science and math exams, and they’d been the\nfirst ones in his schedule. After that, there were no major surprises. He\nimproved marginally on most of his scores from Pre-Trials, especially\nDeflection. On the last day, he wore his jade and fought four of the\nAcademy’s Green Bone teaching assistants in a row over thirty grueling\nminutes. By the end, he was exhausted and battered but still standing, panting\nbut ready to continue. It was not for nothing that Hilo had beaten him and\ntaught him to always get up again.\nThe masters made notes on their clipboards and nodded in dismissal.\nAnden had saluted them and walked out of the testing hall with barely more\npride and triumph than he might’ve felt after completing a menial chore like\nwashing the floor. At least that’s over with. He would graduate; that was the\nimportant thing. These tests weren’t real. The real ones were yet to come.\nWhen he got to the Kaul house, Anden went straight into the courtyard\nwhere the Pillar was sitting at the shaded table with the entire family. They\nwere finishing up a New Year’s Eve dinner, and the delicious smells made\nAnden’s mouth water: roast suckling pig, seafood soup, spicy shrimp in\nsauce, pea shoots with garlic, fried greens. Anden only got food that good\nonce or twice a year, but it was a modest holiday meal for a family like the\nKauls, who in the past had hosted expansive public New Year’s feasts.\nAnden stopped to take in the scene. His cousin Hilo was sitting at one end of\nthe table in a black suit, his back to Anden. Wen leaned close directly on his\nleft, her hand on his leg as if to hold him in place in his seat. Shae sat at the\nother end. Between them on one side were the Maik brothers, and on the\nother sat Kaul Sen in a wheelchair with Kyanla poised nearby. There was an\nempty seat and place setting saved for Anden.\nFor a second, Anden stood, the poignancy of the moment burrowing into\nhim with a pain that made it hard to take another step. The picture was\nincomplete; Lan was missing from it and so too was any sense of joviality.\nThe voices were muted, the postures tense. Even from a distance, the\ngathering had the feeling of a funeral vigil rather than a New Year’s family\nfeast. Only Hilo seemed remotely relaxed or happy. He brushed aside Wen’s\nreach for the teapot and personally refilled the cups around the table. He\nhelped himself to another serving of roast pork, said something lighthearted\nto Tar, who nodded but didn’t smile, and he wrapped an arm lazily around\nWen’s waist."

He smiled and rose from his seat\nto walk toward him. “Andy, you’re late. There’s barely any food left.” He\nembraced his cousin warmly, then led him to his place at the table, next to\ntheir grandfather.\n“Sorry, Hilo-jen,” Anden said as he sat down. “It took me longer than I\nthought it would to get out of the Academy. And the traffic was bad. New\nYear’s week after all.”\n“You should have called me to send a car.” Hilo shoved Anden’s head in\nmock admonishment and doled food onto his plate. Contrary to what Hilo\nhad said, there was still plenty of it sitting on the table. “The Trials are over;\nyou’re not a student anymore. You don’t need to be riding around on a bike\nor taking the bus.”\n“Congratulations on the end of Trials, Anden,” Shae said.\n“Thanks, Shae-jen,” Anden said, not quite meeting her eyes.\nTheir grandfather seemed to rouse from picking at the small morsels of\nfood on his plate. He turned his wizened head toward Anden, his eyes\nsuddenly narrowed and piercing in their intensity. “So you’re one of us now.\nMad Witch’s boy.”\nAnden froze with a spoonful of soup poised in midair. He set it back down\nin his bowl, sickly warmth climbing into his throat and face. Kaul Sen said, “I\nhope you carry jade better than your ma. Ah, she was green, all right, a green\nlady monster—but she went out worse than even her father and brothers.” He\nleveled a bony finger and shook it at Anden. “I said to Lan, when he brought\nyou here: ‘That mixed-blood boy is like a cross between a goat and a tiger—\nwho knows what he’ll be?’”\nHilo stared at his grandfather and spoke in a voice so lethal Anden cringed\nat the sound. “Kyanla, I think it’s past Grandda’s bedtime, don’t you?”\nKyanla sprang up. “Come, come, Kaul-jen,” she fussed, hurrying to pull\nhis wheelchair from the table and take him back into the house. “Time to\nrest.”\n“Mind your jade, Mad Witch’s boy,” Kaul Sen said in parting.\nThe table had fallen silent. Hilo let out a long sigh and threw his napkin\nonto the table. “He’s not well,” he explained to Anden apologetically.\n“Losing jade tolerance does things to old people, up here.” He tapped the side\nof his head.\nAnden nodded mutely. Kaul Sen had never been cruel to him. When\nAnden had been seven years old, the man had seemed like a god, and as\nrecently as a year ago, he’d been strong and hale. He’d said to Anden, “You\nbelong in this family, boy. You’ll be as powerful a Green Bone as my own\ngrandsons.”\n“Ignore him,” Hilo said now. “Go on, Andy, eat. The rest of you stop"

It’s warm, spring is on the way, it’s New Year’s Eve.\nYou know what they say about the first day setting your luck for the rest of\nthe year. Don’t start it in bad spirits.”\nAnden forced himself to chew and swallow. He felt terrible; he’d made\nthings worse by arriving. Putting on a weak but heroic smile, he said,\n“Congratulations on your wedding, Hilo-jen. You look especially beautiful\ntonight, sister Wen.”\n“Now that’s more like it,” Hilo said. “Thank you, Andy.”\nWen smiled thinly, but Anden thought she was studying him with a\nparticularly anxious expression. Her brothers, sitting opposite Anden, seemed\nthe most unhappy tonight. Kehn and Tar had not spoken a word since\nAnden’s appearance, and when they glanced at him, it was with something\napproaching resentment. Anden avoided meeting their eyes. It was the place\nof the Horn and the Pillarman to protect the Pillar with their own lives; they\ncould hardly be faulted for begrudging Anden his part in what would happen\ntomorrow.\nHilo said, “You know what we should’ve had today? Candy coins. We\nalways had candy coins on New Year’s Eve when we were kids, didn’t we,\nShae?” And gradually, limp conversation returned. Anden ate as quickly as\nhe could manage, not wanting to prolong the suffering around the table.\nKyanla returned to clear the dishes, and the family stood slowly, lingering\nfor a minute, glad for dinner to be over, yet reluctant to leave. Shae came\nover to Anden and put a hand on his arm. It seemed a deeply apologetic\ngesture, and Anden knew what she was apologizing for. With Shae so close,\nhe could feel the jade on her, the slightly brittle prickle of her aura, a\nsensation that had been absent when he’d sat across from her over dinner at\nthe barbecue house a seeming eternity ago.\n“I was wrong,” she said in a low voice. “I didn’t listen to you. I …”\n“I know, Shae-jen,” he said. “You don’t have to say it.”\n“What you’re doing now, I didn’t want Hilo to ask it of you. I argued with\nhim about it, told him he was putting you in a terrible position, but he’s\nconvinced it’s the best chance of saving the clan. I’m sorry I couldn’t talk\nhim out of it.”\n“I understand,” Anden said. “It’s my choice.”\nHilo whispered something to Wen, who nodded and departed with her\nbrothers. The Pillar said, “Come with me, Andy. Let’s talk inside.”\n“Should I bring my bag into the guest room?” Anden asked.\n“Leave it. We’ll bring it in later.” Hilo led him, not into the main house,\nbut toward the training hall. When they got there, he flicked on the lights, and\nthey blazed to life over the long wooden floor.

He remembered the last time he’d been in here, the last time\nhe’d seen Lan alive.\nHilo slid the door closed and turned to face Anden. The relaxed manner\nhe’d displayed at dinner was gone, replaced with an equally familiar\ndangerous intensity. It amazed Anden that his cousin could move between the\ntwo states with such speed. “You’ve had a chance to think about it some\nmore,” Hilo said. “You think you can do what I’m asking?”\nAnden nodded. He felt, suddenly, as if this was the moment of true\ncommitment, this was where his entire existence had been leading. The Pillar\nwas counting on him, and him alone, in the clan’s time of need. “I won’t let\nyou down.”\n“I know you won’t, Andy.” Hilo looked stricken for a moment. “We need\nto prepare for tomorrow, but we should do this right. I’m asking you to act on\nbehalf of the clan, on behalf of me, and that makes you a Green Bone of No\nPeak. The graduation ceremony hasn’t happened yet, but you’re through the\nTrials, so you can take oaths. Do you know them by heart, or do you need me\nto say them with you?”\n“I know them,” Anden said. He knelt on the floor in front of his cousin\nand raised his clasped hands to his head. His voice came out strong and\nsteady.\n“The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master. I have been chosen and\ntrained to carry the gift of the gods for the good and protection of the people,\nand against all enemies of the clan, no matter their strength or numbers. I join\nmyself to the fellowship of jade warriors, freely and with my whole being,\nand I will call them my brothers-in-arms. Should I ever be disloyal to my\nbrother, may I die by the blade. Should I ever fail to come to the aid of my\nbrother, may I die by the blade. Should I ever seek personal gain at the\nexpense of my brother, may I die by the blade.

Hilo made Anden drive. “I want to make sure you don’t damage\nmy car on the way back,” he said. It had been some time since Lan had taught\nAnden to drive in one of the family’s old cars, and the teen was so nervous\nbehind the wheel of his cousin’s prized automobile that he crawled the\nmonstrous sedan like an old lady all the way there, and Hilo teased him for it.\n“The Duchesse Priza is a fucking powerhouse and you’re driving it like a\npedal cart.”"

The Duchesse’s slow approach had been\nseen and reported long before they got anywhere near the Docks, so when\nthey pulled up in front of the Twice Lucky and Anden turned off the engine,\nthe first thing Hilo saw was that the parking lot appeared to be clear of any\nreal customers. Only a few large black cars like Gont’s ZT Valor were parked\nin the side lot, and there was a small crowd of Mountain Green Bones\ngathered in front of the entrance to the restaurant.\nHilo waited in the car for a minute. He could Perceive the eagerness of the\nmen outside, and the implacable aura of Gont Asch rolling like a black\nboulder through the interior of the Twice Lucky toward the front door. And\nmost clearly of all, he Perceived his cousin’s dread beside him, the rapid\nbeating of Anden’s heart, and he was impressed that the young man’s face\nbetrayed so little of his fear. Hilo put a hand on Anden’s shoulder, rested it\nthere for a few seconds, then got out of the car. He took off his jacket and laid\nit on the passenger side seat, then he shut the door and strode toward the\ngathered enemy. After a moment, he sensed and heard Anden get out and\nfollow twenty paces behind him, his heartbeat still loud in Hilo’s Perception.\nGont Asch stood before him now, in a leather vest with moon blade at the\nwaist, flanked by a dozen of his warriors. Hilo stopped a short distance away.\nFor all their mutual enmity, the two men rarely faced each other in person,\nand for the span of several unhurried breaths they stood regarding the other.\nNo one else spoke or moved; they watched the unfolding exchange. At last,\nHilo said, “You know, this is my favorite restaurant.”\n“I can see why,” rumbled Gont.\n“Have you tried the crispy squid balls?”\n“I eat them nearly every day,” said the Horn of the Mountain.\nHilo’s left eye squinted and his lips pulled back in a tight grin. “I’m\nenvious.” He glanced up and down the line of seasoned Mountain fighters,\ncertain some of them were wearing the jade of his slain Fists. “All right,” he\nsaid. “I’m here. It was a low thing you did to Eiten, you fuckers.” He spat to\nthe side. “Any man who challenges me with a clean blade, I’d give him\nrespect. But you stole a warrior’s dignity to get my attention. Well, you have\nit now.”\nGont paced forward slowly like an advancing lion. His voice was a\ncautious growl. “If this were a dispute of personal honor, the two of us would\nhave matched clean blades long ago, Kaul-jen. But this is clan war.

I assumed I’d have to cut my way through every last\nGreen Bone in No Peak to get to you.”\n“You still want a duel, I’ll give you one right here and now,” Hilo said,\nfollowing the enemy Horn around with his eyes and Perception.\nGont gave a low, snorting chuckle. “That wasn’t the offer. I’m not so\nselfish as to risk the outcome of a war on a single duel.” He stopped in front\nof Hilo, his broad frame casting a large shadow across the space between\nthem. “We both know the Mountain will defeat No Peak in the end. Why let\nyour loyal followers throw their lives away for you? Why drag out the\nsuffering of this city we both care for? If I were in your position, I would\nthink to the selfless example of Baijen.”\nHilo was silent. An invisible spasm coursed through him—he did not\nwant to die. He was certainly prepared to, but he didn’t want to. He knew\nGont could Perceive the burst of conflicted emotions, but he didn’t try to hide\nthem. “You gave me certain assurances,” he said. He nodded back to where\nAnden stood, some distance behind him. “My cousin is here to make sure\nthey’re fulfilled.”\nGont shifted his gaze to the teenager and motioned him over. “Come here,\nAnden Emery.” Anden approached, calmly but visibly reluctant. Gont\ngestured him closer and closer, until the young man was near enough for the\nHorn to place a large, meaty hand on his shoulder as they both faced Hilo.\n“Do you know what part you’re to play in this agreement between your\ncousin and myself?”\n“He knows,” Hilo said, his jaw stiffening at the sight of Gont’s grip on\nAnden’s shoulder. “I trust him to stay out of it once it starts. He’s to bring me\nback to the family; I want to be in one piece and with every stone of jade still\non my body. If Anden returns safely and reports that everything happened as\nyou promised, my Weather Man will surrender control of the clan. I’ve\nspoken to my Horn and written letters to all of my Fists ordering them to lay\ndown their blades and accept your terms. If you honor your bargain, she’ll\ngive these letters to them. If you don’t, all my Fists and Fingers will fight to\nthe last man to bring the Mountain to its knees. You’d destroy us, but the\nvictory would be hollow. Your clan would be crippled, and the city in ruins.”\nHilo’s words held absolute conviction; he meant what he said. “We both\nknow it could go that way, but neither of us is so selfish, Gont-jen. That’s\nwhy I’m standing here.”\nGont nodded, a grudging respect in his eyes. He released Anden and said,\n“I give my word that young Anden here won’t be harmed or interfered with.”\n“One other thing,” Hilo said. “I want you to finish it. I merit a clean-"

I merit a clean-\nbladed duel and instead you give me this. The least I deserve in a death of\nconsequence is to not go down in a careless, hacking mess. Do you\nunderstand, Gont-jen? I want another Horn to give me a warrior’s death.”\nAfter a moment, Gont inclined his head, a touch of dark humor in the\nmovement of his lips. “I assure you it would be my pleasure, Kaul-jen.”\nHilo ran his eyes through Gont’s men. They had followed their Horn,\ninching closer in anticipation, but now they halted and shifted back, sensing\nthe change in the set of Hilo’s body, the settling of his shoulders, the\nreadiness in his knees. Hilo undid the next two buttons on his shirt and\nyanked the top of it wide open to reveal the long line of jade pieces studding\nhis collarbone. “Come on, then!” He was suddenly impatient. He drew his\ntalon knife, spun it around his index finger by the hilt ring before gripping it\nand dropping into the coiled stance of an experienced fighter.\n“Gont-jen, show me which of your men is greenest with the knife!”\nAnden stood off to the side, Gont’s weighty presence hovering near him. He\nstifled a gasp as the three Mountain men circling Hilo closed in together. The\nscene became a blur of movement and slashing that Anden could barely\nfollow. They were good fighters, these men who had stepped forward with\ntheir Horn’s permission. They wore jade through their eyebrows and ears,\naround their fingers and wrists and necks. They moved with supple ferocity.\nYet they must’ve known right from the start that in volunteering for this\nworthy task, they were likely to die. Kaul Hiloshudon was a feared talon\nknife fighter and now Anden understood why.\nThe Kekonese talon knife is a hooked, double-edged four-inch blade used\nfor slashing, puncturing, hooking, and controlling the joints. Anden had seen\nHilo’s weapon; it had three jade stones set flush in the handle and was made\nof the same Da Tanori steel as the best moon blades, but unlike the moon\nblade, which has always been the quintessential Green Bone weapon, the\ntalon knife is the tool of the street fighter. Simple, jadeless versions abound in\nKekon and youngsters in Green Bone families learn to handle it long before\nthey ever touch any other weapon.\nHilo fought as if he didn’t even have a knife. He never looked at his hands\nor his blade, didn’t rely on leading only with the right side, never seemed\ntense in the arm or overly conscious of his weapon, the way anyone less\ncomfortable would behave. He weaved and sidestepped and circled,\ndeflecting his opponents’ attacks and entering their space with his own—\nexcept that each contact he made was punctuated with flashes of steel. One\nfighter came at Hilo with a high cut; Hilo hooked the man’s wrist, slashed\nacross the inside of the elbow, slipped the blade over the other arm, and\ndrove up, slicing into and around the man’s neck like paring a piece of fruit."

The man was not fast enough with his Steel to\nfollow the flurry; the knife cut into his jugular and he fell with a bloody\ngurgle. Hilo was already moving on, his eyes blazing motes of fire. So it was\nwith the next man as well; Hilo returned one slash with three or four of his\nown in fluid succession. The next opponent caught Hilo across the ribs and\nthen across the back of the neck. On most people, the talon knife would part\nflesh effortlessly, but Hilo’s Steel was nearly as good as Gont’s was\npurported to be—not so much in strength as in fluidity. A master of Steel\ncould direct his jade energy in a nimble dance of tension and release,\navoiding hampering his own movements, flexing a shifting shield of near\ninvulnerability at an instant. Anden stopped breathing for a second as he saw\nthe blade part Hilo’s clothes, yet only a trickle of blood stained them. Hilo\ngrunted as he repositioned and threw Strength into a left-handed strike to the\nthroat. As expected, his opponent slipped and reacted, meeting the blow by\nSteeling into his upper body. With a quick step, Hilo went low and slashed\nthe man across the femoral artery before stabbing into the back of the knee.\nThe Green Bone buckled with a cry and Hilo matched it with a triumphant\nsnarl as he drove the knife tip between the vertebrae of the man’s neck.\n“You’re wasting my time!” he shouted, dancing away from the body.\nSweat stood out on his brow and neck. “At this rate, Gont-jen, you’ll run out\nof Green Bones! If I’d known fighting Mountain Fists would be this easy, I’d\nhave come around here earlier!”\nHe’s goading them on, Anden thought, despairing. The Mountain fighters\nwho came forward now were not hesitant. They were infuriated by the deaths\nof their comrades and spurred on by the knowledge that even the best fighter\nis doomed to tire rapidly against multiple opponents. Anden forced himself to\nstand unmoving, to watch and not look away as the fight became a true\nmelee. Hilo scrambled to stay out of the center of the storm. He slammed two\nmen back with a Deflection as he took on a third. He leapt Light to avoid a\nsimultaneous attack from two sides but was dragged back down. He\nChanneled into an attacker, but before he could finish the kill, he was\nknocked to his knees by another man’s Strength. Anden’s breath grew\nshallow and panicked; his nails dug into his palms as glimpses of his cousin\ndisappeared behind the blur of dark-clad bodies and flashing knives.\nHilo’s talon knife skittered across the pavement out of the circle of\nfighters, and Gont Asch bellowed, “Enough!” A few of his men, maddened\nwith the fight, didn’t obey at once, and Gont bellowed again, flinging his arm\nout in a wide, shallow Deflection that sent his own Green Bones staggering.\nWhen they parted, Anden saw that the Pillar of No Peak was on his hands"

There was a rattle in his breath as his shoulders heaved up and down.\nSuddenly, Anden thought of the time Hilo had come to the Academy and\nhanded him a beating just for the fun of it, to test what kind of a man he was,\nwhether he was the sort to keep fighting no matter how outmatched. Hilo had\nbeaten him so easily that day, toyed with him the way a large dog pins and\nnips a small one. At that time, Anden had never imagined he would see this:\nthe most ferocious of the Kauls as helpless against his enemies as Anden had\nbeen against him. Gont strode forward. “Enough,” he rumbled again.\n“You’ve taken enough Green Bone blood today, Kaul Hiloshudon of No\nPeak. You deserve your warrior’s death.” Gont reached for the hilt of his\nmoon blade, and in that instant, Hilo propelled himself forward like a shot,\ntackling Gont across the midsection.\nThe two men crashed to the ground together. Hilo spat in Gont’s face.\n“Did you think I’d offer you my neck like a duck on a fucking chopping\nblock? I’m going to take you with me!” And he raised up just enough to\ngather his remaining Strength for a skull-crushing blow.\nGont blasted Hilo back with a Deflection that knocked the other man flat\nonto his back. Mountain fighters ran forward to attack again, but Gont\nshouted, “Leave him!” as he sprang to his feet, remarkably fast and Light for\na man his size. The Horn stalked toward Kaul, who rolled to his feet with a\ngroan and attacked again. Gont fended off the weakened man’s lunge and hit\nhim across the face. Hilo fell but rose again, and again Gont dropped him,\nthis time with a kick that buckled him across the ribs. Anden shook; his eyes,\nhis throat, his chest burned. A wild and vindictively satisfied light had come\ninto Gont’s eyes, emerging from behind the heavy curtain of stony control.\n“You … are … so … persistent,” he growled with each blow that sent Hilo\nstaggering or collapsing, only to rise again. “You … don’t know … when to\nstop.”\nWith a heaving of Strength, Gont lifted the slighter man and hurled him\nbodily several feet. Hilo smashed into the asphalt, and this time he didn’t rise.\nHe lay like a broken and torn doll, and his chest barely moved in a gurgling,\nrasping breath. As Gont drew his moon blade, Hilo’s head tilted back and he\ncried out, “Now!”\nAnden ran. None of the Green Bones were paying him any attention. He\nwas a teenage student, merely a designated witness to this event; none of\nthem had seen a weapon on him, or sensed even the faintest jade aura.

Now he\nsprinted, his heart a drum in his ears, and flung himself upon his cousin’s\nprone and bloodied form. “Andy,” Hilo whispered, and reached out his hand,\nand from the inside of Hilo’s left sleeve, Anden tore out a long string of jade\nand looped it around his closed fist.\nTwo days ago, Hilo had had nearly every piece of jade he owned removed\nand strung onto a thin cord that could be taped snugly against the inside of his\nleft forearm—the arm not drawing attention with a talon knife. He left only\nthe studs on his collarbone, the ones everyone saw, in their usual place. There\nwas no difference in his aura; he still carried every one of his gems against\nhis skin. Now, Hilo’s body shuddered violently as his jade was ripped away.\nAnden’s world exploded in a rush of pure energy.\nIt was as if he’d burst out of the confines of his own body. He was\neverywhere and nowhere; he was crouched over his cousin, he was looking\ndown on himself and Gont from above, he was inside the people around him,\nthe pulse of their blood and the throbbing of their organs cavernous,\nsurrounding him. His own body was a strange and limiting thing—an odd\ncombination of systems and parts, organic matter, flesh twined around bone,\nskin and water and brain matter—and he was keenly aware that he was\nmerely that, and much more than that. He was sensation itself; he was\nconscious energy, energy that knows and manipulates itself at will.\nNever had he imagined such awareness, such ecstasy of power and\nfeeling.\nLast night, when they’d rehearsed how it would happen, Anden had\ntugged at the hidden jade without pulling it entirely off Hilo’s arm. They\nhadn’t wanted to risk dangerously weakening themselves with jade rush and\nwithdrawal. Even still, Anden had felt the tingly high of so much jade, more\nthan he’d ever been in contact with before. That had been nothing compared\nto this.\n“Don’t make a move before I signal you,” Hilo had said. “If I die before I\ncan call you, you might still have a chance, but only if Gont is close. He has\nto be close.”\nGont was close now. Anden felt the hitch in the man’s motion, the instant\nof complete surprise. Hilo had done a good job keeping all of the Horn’s\nattention focused on him, and him alone, rousing his temper to obscure\nanything that might have made him glance back at Anden, even the split\nsecond of intent between Hilo’s cry and Anden’s response. The moon blade\nin Gont’s hand swung down, but there was indecision in it; the white length\nof metal fell so slowly, as if the air it parted were thick as honey, and Anden\nfelt the bizarre urge to laugh when he realized Gont hadn’t slowed down—it\nwas Anden’s perception of time that had elongated a thousandfold.\nAnden could feel the man’s jade aura like a tangible thing that could be\ngrasped with both hands.

Gont froze, and then understanding and alarm washed into his\neyes. His legendary Steel poured up and around him. Anden felt his questing\nforce being pushed back, sensed Gont’s powerful aura battening itself in\ndefense. Anden rose to his feet, the string of jade stones clutched in his fist,\none hand still reaching out to his enemy, and pushed. His Channeling was\nlike an iron spear. It tore through the outer layers of the man’s Steel and\nstopped just short, met by impenetrable resistance, unable to go further.\nGont’s eyes bulged. The moon blade quavered as if his entire body was\nlocked in a paralysis of action and reaction. Anden felt his skin tingle with\nsudden climbing heat. Blood trickled from Gont’s mouth and nose; shock and\npanic strengthened his Steel, and Anden felt it expanding inexorably back\nagainst him. He could no longer breathe; the force building inside him was\nsuch that he felt his eyes and lungs would soon burst.\nIn that instant of desperate stalemate, Hilo pushed himself up in a surge of\ntenuous strength driven by supreme force of will alone. He grabbed Gont’s\ntalon knife from its hip sheath and sank it into the man’s side. Gont let out a\nroar of pain. “Don’t you remember?” Hilo rasped. “Baijen came back from\nthe dead to kill his enemy.”\nHilo collapsed to the ground. The remaining Mountain fighters sprang\nforward to help their Horn, to cut Anden and Hilo to pieces, but they were too\nlate. The talon knife buried in Gont’s side had created the needed opening.\nGont’s attention and Steel wavered, and Anden Channeled with all his force,\nfelt the unbearable pressure inside him release in a violent surge, lancing into\nthe other man’s body.\nGont’s heart stopped, his lungs seized, the veins in his brain burst. Anden,\nunable to block out the cruel clarity of his Perception, shared in the sensation\nof death, felt every terrible spike of destruction as it tore through his enemy’s\nbody. Gont was dying; he was dying too. As the Horn fell, Anden sank with\nhim, mouth open but unable to make a single sound. Then the storm of death\ncrashed out and another wave hit: the blowback of jade energy rushing into\nAnden, like a wind sucked up by the angry god Yofo and shot out as an earth-\nscouring typhoon. The return energy rush from destroying a man as powerful\nas Gont Asch was indescribable. The light and heat of a thousand stars\nerupted in Anden’s skull. His head rocked back, and he screamed from the\nvery pit of his soul in a terror of agony and ecstasy.\nHe was going to combust; he needed to expend this terrible boiling, this\noverabundance clawing under the surface of his skin, desperate to escape the\nconfines of his flesh. The Mountain fighters rushing at him with upraised\nblades were like vessels into which to Channel the overflow. An outlet, a\nprecious outlet.

He didn’t even need to touch them; it was as easy as snuffing\nthe life from mice in a cage. He caught up two men in midstep. They clutched\ntheir chests, eyes and mouths wide with shock, blades clattering to the\nground. He watched with curious detachment and greedy joy as they died.\nThe Green Bones that remained backed away. Anden registered their fear\nof him and heard himself give an odd giggle. He was a demon—a pale\nteenage monster drunk on jade energy and killing. What happens when you\ncross a goat and a tiger? Kaul Sen had wondered. Something strange and\nterrifying.\nWith a shudder, Anden’s spine rippled. He flung his hands out sharply,\nfingers splayed, unleashing a Deflection that tore through the air and lifted\nthree men off their feet, throwing them into the air before they tumbled and\nrolled to the ground. They scrambled up, staggering and limping, and staring\nback with wild alarm, they ran from him, the others following on their heels.\nTheir footfalls thundered.\nThe barest sense of reality floated back to Anden’s conscious mind, which\nfelt as if it were curled in terror in a dark corner of himself. Hilo’s unmoving\nform lay on the ground, the blood and life draining from his wounds. Anden\nhad to … he had to get help … phone someone. He stared at the coils of jade\nin his right hand, and with a wrenching force of will as strong as if he were\nplucking out his own eyeball, he opened his fingers and let the string of gems\nfall. He stood up, took one step, and suddenly the entire world tilted and fell\naway into sudden blackness, and Anden sank, insensible, to the asphalt next\nto his cousin.\nCHAPTER\n55\nNot Finished\nA\nnden awoke in the hospital, hooked up to an intravenous tube and\nmachines that beeped quietly. His head felt heavy and swollen, his eyes\ncrusty. His throat was raw, and his skin was tender, as if the entire surface of\nhis body was a single bruise, and it hurt to even shift his weight on the soft\nmattress of the hospital bed. For a moment, he couldn’t understand why he\nwas here, and then it came back to him all at once. His heart gave a panicked\nlurch, and he was quickly bathed in sweat.\nThe remembered terror and euphoria of the jade he’d harnessed—so much\njade—filled his mind completely. Nothing else seemed of any importance at\nall. Wonder and craving gripped him as he looked down at his pale bare arms\nlying on top of the white bedsheet. He’d killed Gont Asch. Horn of the\nMountain, one of the most powerful Green Bones in Janloon. He’d felt the\nman’s death as if it had been his own, and when the agony of it had passed\nthrough him, he’d reveled in the release of the man’s life energy recoiling\ninto his own. Such exhilaration. He’d killed those other two men, too; their\ndeaths had been satisfying, though not quite as memorable. Perhaps only the\nfirst kill was so intense? Or was it the strength and jade ability of the man he\nkilled that made the difference?"

Or was it the strength and jade ability of the man he\nkilled that made the difference?\nAh, jade! It was just as the penitents said: Jade was divine. It came from\nHeaven, and it could make men into gods. Anden licked his parched lips,\nwondering where the jade was now, when he would get to put it back on and\nfeel that way again.\nAnd suddenly, he wanted to cry.\nHe wasn’t normal; he knew that. He’d always suspected such would be\nthe case. The powerful but unstable Aun line mixed with foreign blood and\njade sensitivity. Yet he’d been told, and he’d believed, that the rigorous\ntraining of the Academy would overcome his deficiencies. Discipline and\njade acclimation created Green Bones who were powerful but controlled, not\nmonsters that laughed with the pure sensate joy of reaching out and stopping\nhearts. Hilo had killed many times, but he was still sane.\nHilo! Anden’s head pounded as he pushed himself up.\nA nurse came in, a stout, unsmiling woman who checked some readouts\non Anden’s monitor. “Where’s Kaul-jen?” Anden croaked. The woman\ndidn’t answer at first, merely released some medication into his IV tube. “Is\nhe alive?” Anden asked.\n“He’s alive,” the nurse said. Anden heard it as if through a gathering fog.\nWhatever was in the IV tube, it was powerfully sedating. In a minute, he was\nunconscious.\nWhen he woke again, Hilo was sitting by his bedside. Anden gasped at the\nsight of him. It was as if the famous youthfulness of his cousin’s face had\nbeen siphoned out from under his skin, leaving a scarecrow version of\nhimself. Hilo’s eyes were bruised, his cheek split and stitched, and one wrist\nwas splinted. Despite this, upon seeing Anden awake, he smiled broadly at\nonce, his sunken eyes dancing with warmth. “You did it, Andy.” In a rush of\naffection, he bent over Anden, seized the top of his hair and kissed him on the\nbrow. “You sent the Mountain running. You saved the clan, cousin. And my\nlife; I’ll never forget about that.”\n“How did we …” Anden swallowed, trying to moisten his mouth. He saw\nhis eyeglasses on the table next to him and put them on shakily. “How are we\nalive? What happened after …?” It was difficult to form complete sentences.\nHilo laughed. He got up and filled a paper cup with water from the sink.\nThey were in a private hospital room, Anden realized. Hilo moved gingerly,\nwith little of his usual languid grace, as if he’d been taken apart and put back\ntogether and wasn’t sure if all the pieces were accounted for yet. He sat back\ndown and placed the water in Anden’s hand, closing his cousin’s fingers\naround the cup as if guiding an uncoordinated child. Unsteadily, Anden\nraised it to his lips and drank, grateful and embarrassed to have the Pillar of\nthe clan sitting here and treating him so gently.\n“Mr. Une, the owner of the Twice Lucky, saw what happened and phoned"

Shae called Kehn and Tar—they were waiting in a building just\nacross the freeway in Junko, less than five minutes away.” Hilo paused to\ndraw a breath, wincing at some unseen injury, but still smiling. “It’s all good\nnews, Andy. After the Mountain lost its Horn and half a dozen of its other top\nGreen Bones, Kehn and our Fists swept in like a fire. They took back the rest\nof the Docks in a day.” Hilo’s face was bright with pride. “After he and Shae\nsaw us to the hospital, Tar won us the rest of Sogen. Juen and his men pushed\ninto Spearpoint and killed so many of the Mountain Fingers there that we\ndon’t have to worry anymore about losing Poor Man’s Road. We turned the\nwar. You did.”\nAnden tried to absorb this. “Does this mean Ayt’s been defeated?”\nHilo cocked his head. “Andy, a Green Bone’s not defeated until they’re\ndead. Didn’t the two of us just prove that?” He pressed his lips together. “The\nMountain’s an old clan, a big clan. We’ve hit them bad and forced Ayt to pull\nback. She’ll have to name a new Horn—probably Gont’s First Fist; I’m told\nhe’s still alive. It’ll be some time before they can come back at us again. But\nAyt’s not finished.” There was grimness in Hilo’s voice but a dancing\noptimism in his eyes, something Anden hadn’t seen since before Lan’s death.\n“But neither are we, Andy,” he said, leaning in as if to share a secret. “You\nand me, we got Gont. We’ll get her next.”\nAnden was confused; why was it so hard for him to feel happy right now?\nHe was alive, Hilo was alive, Gont was dead, and No Peak had prevailed. He\nought to be relieved, he ought to be in good spirits just as his cousin was.\nInstead he felt hollow and lacking, hungry not for victory or vengeance, but\nonly for the awareness and power that had been so fleeting and\ntransformative. Brief exposure to a large quantity of jade had carved his mind\nwith indelible knowledge of what it was capable of. Everything else—family\nand clan included—paled in comparison.\n“How … long have I been in here?” he asked.\n“Five days,” Hilo said. At Anden’s look of alarm, he said, “Don’t worry,\nyou’ll be fine. I was dancing closer to the grave than you, and you’re younger\nand stronger than I am. Dr. Truw’s been in here constantly for both of us. We\nshould make him our personal family doctor.”\nAnden wasn’t sure he could put his thoughts into words, but he had to try.\n“Hilo … I don’t feel right. I feel strange, empty, like I don’t care about\nimportant things anymore. Killing Gont—I felt it all. It was the worst thing\nI’ve ever had to go through, but I want to do it again.” Anden’s voice cracked"

Is it\nthe Itches?”\n“Don’t be silly,” Hilo said. He laid a compassionate hand on Anden’s\nshoulder and sighed. “Handling that much jade for the first time, under that\nkind of stress—it knocked you flat. You’re especially sensitive, no question\nof that. We’ve been giving you regular doses of SN1 to bring the fever down,\nreset your system. The doctor says your brain scans are normal now, so give\nit a few more days and you’ll feel like yourself again.” He gave Anden a pat.\n“Don’t worry, graduation is still a week away. You’ll be out of here by then\nfor sure. Neither of us is missing that.”\nAnden looked over at the IV stand, followed the clear tube to where it was\ntaped to the inside of his arm. “I’m being doped with shine?” The poison that\nhad killed Lan, dripping into his veins.\n“Don’t look so worried,” Hilo said quickly. He flicked the hanging tube\nwith a finger. “It’s entirely controlled; there’s no risk. Dr. Truw’s been\nmonitoring you the whole time. You’ll be weaned to a low dose by the time\nyou’re out of here, and the doctor says we can talk about whether to keep you\non it or try taking you off. He doesn’t suggest going off it yet since you’ll be\ngetting your graduation jade soon. Better for your body to have that safety\ncushion for now. It’ll help you.”\nAnden felt overcome with exhaustion. He leaned his head back and closed\nhis eyes, his chest tight, the nonspecific desire to weep still building inside\nhim yet unable to find release, mixing instead with the confused craving and\nthe drug crawling through his veins.\n“Just rest for now, Andy,” Hilo said gently, and didn’t say anything else\nafter that. His hand still rested on Anden’s shoulder, and through the physical\ncontact, Anden felt the familiar thrum of his cousin’s jade aura, faint and\nmuted, either by Anden’s own dulled senses or because Hilo had not\nrecovered enough to be wearing all his jade. All that jade Anden had held—it\nbelonged to Hilo, who had so much he didn’t even feel anything when he got\nnew pieces. Anden lay still, but resentment and envy coursed through him\nlike an infection taking hold.\nCHAPTER\n56\nGraduation Day\nI\nn years to come, the city would recall the holiday week that came to pass as\nthe New Year’s bloodletting of the Janloon clans. Many referred to it as the\nvengeance of the Kauls. In some parts of the city it was nodded at\napprovingly, in others it elicited the nervous tugging of earlobes. What was\napparent by the time the districts settled into a new stalemate was that neither\nclan would be enjoying a swift victory. Despite all doubts to the contrary, the\nyoungest grandchildren of the Torch had fended off annexation, and in so\ndoing, solidified unquestioned clan leadership."

Despite all doubts to the contrary, the\nyoungest grandchildren of the Torch had fended off annexation, and in so\ndoing, solidified unquestioned clan leadership.\nIt was tradition for the graduating year-eights of Kaul Dushuron\nAcademy, who finished their Trials before the holidays but had to wait until\nthe auspicious start of the year for final results and graduation, to spend the\nfirst week after the break performing back-breaking service on the campus\ngrounds—a final lesson in the Divine Virtue of humility—before being\nallowed to take their oaths and receive their jade. Anden was still recovering\nin the hospital and not able to join his classmates in scrubbing paving stones,\nrepairing fences, pruning trees, and guiding clueless year-ones from place to\nplace. True to Hilo’s prediction, however, he was out of Janloon General\nHospital two days before graduation, and well enough to attend convocation\non an overcast spring day, gray with the threat of rain.\nWord had spread that Anden had been the only one with the Pillar at the\nbattle that had killed Gont Asch. When he arrived in formal Academy robes\nto line up in the Gathering Hall before the ceremonies, a deep hush preceded\nhim wherever he walked. At the check-in table, Master Sain inclined his head\nwith more respect than Anden had ever received from an instructor. “Emery.\nStand at the end of the line. You’ll be the last to enter.” Anden knew that to\nmean he’d received the highest marks in the Trials, which, combined with\nFirst of Class standing in the Pre-Trials, had compensated for his only\nslightly better than average academic scores to place him Rank One.\nAnden saluted and retreated to the end of the forming line. “Ton,” he said\nin greeting. Ton startled before raising his hands in a salute. “Anden-jen,” he\nsaid. “I’m glad to see you’re well.” There was a formality in Ton’s voice, the\ntone of a Finger addressing a Fist, and Anden stopped, uncertain of how to\nrespond. He wanted to correct Ton for addressing him as a Green Bone even\nbefore the graduation ceremony, but it was clear from the other teen’s manner\nthat he’d done it deliberately. Anden swallowed his growing discomfort and\nturned to nod hello to Dudo and Pau; both of them dipped into salutes.\nAnden’s gaze drifted behind them to Lott. A fleeting emotion, the dim\nshadow of an ache, passed through Anden’s center, but that was all; he didn’t\nhave room for anything else. That part of him felt numb. Lott, who ever since\nhis father’s violent death, had a grim, hollow-eyed look about him, inclined\nhis head toward Anden civilly. “Jen.”\nAnden turned and faced the front of the line, closing his hands within the\nlong sleeves of his formal black robes. Two weeks of convalescence, healing\nsessions with Dr. Truw, and administered SN1 had done what Hilo had\npromised it would: Anden felt physically recovered, and more like himself\nthan he’d been when he’d awoken in the hospital, distraught and parched\nwith jade craving. Even so, it had been a mental struggle to work himself up\nto the event today, to prepare himself to stand before the staring eyes of not"

Even so, it had been a mental struggle to work himself up\nto the event today, to prepare himself to stand before the staring eyes of not\njust his fellow students, but the entire clan.\n“You’re a hero, Andy,” Hilo had said, but Anden didn’t feel like a hero.\nHe felt damaged and unsure of himself. He thought of the SN1 still\ncirculating like a pollutant through his bloodstream. These people knew what\nhe’d done but didn’t see what he’d become: a danger. A volatile substance,\nheld stable with the aid of dubious modern science.\nAt the sounding of the drums outside, the one hundred and twenty-six\nmen and thirty-two women who’d completed the full eight years of Green\nBone training at Kaul Du Academy shuffled out of the Gathering Hall and\ninto the main courtyard, filing neatly into rows in front of the low stage that\nhad been set up facing the hundreds of folding chairs containing watching\nrelatives and clan members.\nAnden knelt on the pavers with his classmates under the tent that had been\nerected to shield against the threat of rain. As Grandmaster Le began\nspeaking, Anden looked over his shoulder into the rows of spectators. He\nfound the Kauls at once, sitting front and center. Hilo was in a sharp olive\nsuit and black vest he’d bought just for the occasion; he looked much better,\nhis face still scarred but no longer gaunt. He was clearly in good spirits, as\nhe’d been on the car ride over, exuding the cheerful nonchalance that had\nalmost disappeared from him in recent months. He had one arm curled\naround Wen’s shoulders. Anden saw him tug her affectionately to the side of\nhis body and pull the hood of her jacket over her head to cut the slight but\ndamp wind. On Hilo’s other side was Maik Kehn, and next to Wen was the\nWeather Man. Shae sat erect, in a dark skirt and blouse, her gaze serious and\nslightly preoccupied, but when she noticed Anden watching, she gave him a\nsmall smile.\nHe brought his attention back to the front as Grandmaster Le called\nforward the first group of students. All year-eights were required to declare\ntheir intended allegiances prior to final Trials, and these eleven graduates had\nelected to take penitent’s oaths. A Learned One from the Temple of Divine\nReturn mounted the few steps onto the platform to administer the oath of\npenitence. The eleven students stood and approached the stage; they knelt at\nthe front of the assembly and recited the lines binding them to a life of\nreligious service, then touched their heads to the ground before rising and\nwalking behind their classmates. The next twenty-five students had\ncommitted their jade abilities to the healing arts; they were called forward to\ntake oaths before a master physician of the College of Bioenergetic Medicine,\nwhere they would continue their training. Anden shifted, his legs numb, as a\nthird group of eighteen graduates was called up before Grandmaster Le\nhimself to pledge themselves to the honorable profession of teaching the jade\ndisciplines. They would return to the Academy as assistant teachers the\nfollowing week, with the hope of one day becoming masters.\nAt last, the remainder of the class, the large group who’d declared service\nand loyalty to the No Peak clan, came forward en masse to take their oaths.

A\nripple went through the spectators and graduates alike as the Pillar of the clan\nstrode down the center aisle and mounted the stage with quick steps. Hilo\nturned and looked out across the crowd. Anden thought he looked pleased.\nRoughly a hundred new Green Bones for the clan, nearly two-thirds of the\ngraduating class. Some would become Luckbringers, but a majority would\nstart as Fingers, for Kehn and his Fists to command.\nEveryone waited for Hilo to begin speaking the jade warrior’s oaths line\nby line, so the gathered graduates could repeat after him. Instead, for a long\ntime he said nothing while an uncomfortable pause lengthened. People began\nglancing at one another in confusion. Grandmaster Le cleared his throat\nimpatiently, but Hilo shook his head. “Grandmaster,” he said, smiling, and\nspeaking loudly enough that the crowd could hear him, “I didn’t appreciate\nthis place enough when I was standing down there in those black robes, so let\nme take in this beautiful sight for a minute. I’m not a student anymore, so you\ncan’t even wallop me for holding you up.” The crowd chuckled at this. He’s\ntruly the Pillar now, and everyone knows it, Anden thought. And still himself,\nmostly.\n“Brothers and sisters,” Hilo shouted. “The Pillar is the master of the clan,\nbut Pillars change, and still the brotherhood survives and continues. You’re\ntaking this oath as much to one another as you are to me. So who knows the\nGreen Bone warrior’s oaths by heart and can lead his classmates in taking\nthem first?”\nThis was not how the ceremony was supposed to go, but even\nGrandmaster Le didn’t try to intercede when Lott stepped forward from the\nline. “I will, Kaul-jen.”\nHilo nodded and motioned the teen onto the stage. Anden watched, his\nheart beating in his throat, as Lott walked calmly up the three steps and knelt\nbefore Hilo, who leaned in to whisper something briefly into his ear before\nstepping back. Anden caught a glimpse of Lott’s bleak and determined\nexpression as he raised his clasped hands to his forehead. “The clan is my\nblood, and the Pillar is its master,” he began in a strong voice that carried\nclearly across the courtyard. And the voices of a hundred of his classmates\nrose up and echoed him: The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master!\nAs his lips moved, reciting the oath he’d already taken two weeks ago,\nAnden couldn’t tear his eyes from the sight of Lott kneeling up there in front\nof everyone, hands raised and eyes lowered before Hilo’s warm but\npenetrating gaze. A bewildered grief rose in Anden. He was certain this was\nnever what Lott had wanted; he’d never wanted to follow in his father’s\nbloody footsteps. It ought to be him, Anden, up there instead. The Kauls were\nhis family; he’d already proven himself worthy of jade, and everyone was\nacknowledging him as Hilo’s protégé and a fearsome new force in the clan."

The other new Green Bones of No Peak repeated his words,\nclosing the oath. As he had with Anden, Hilo drew Lott to his feet, embraced\nhim, and with one hand on his shoulder, said something to him in a low voice\nthat Anden couldn’t hear. Lott gave a short, tight nod, then stepped off the\nstage to take his place back in the line. Hilo clasped his hands in sharp salute\nand raised his voice, addressing the new members of the clan. “I accept your\noaths and call you my brothers-in-arms.”\n“Our blood for the Pillar!” someone shouted. A few other voices rose up\nas Hilo descended the stage. “No Peak! No Peak!” Anden began to turn to the\ncrowd to see who’d started the chant, but Grandmaster Le, glaring\ndisapprovingly, brought up his hands to demand silence. All the graduates,\nand many members of the audience, had grown up under the grandmaster’s\nstrict rule, and instinctively fell quiet.\n“Now,” said Grandmaster Le with more than a touch of reproof at both\nthe overly dramatic oath-taking performance and the crowd’s reaction, “we\nmust award these graduates the jade they’ve earned for their years of hard\nwork, discipline, and training.”\nAt the back of the stage was a table with four separate groupings of small\nwooden boxes. Every set of eyes swiveled eagerly to Master Sain as he took a\nbox from the first pile and opened it. “Au Satingya,” he read from the inside\nof the lid.\nImmediately following final Trials, all the year-eights had turned in their\ntraining bands and the jade they contained. Now their jade would be returned\npermanently, possibly with fewer or more stones than they’d surrendered,\ndepending on how they’d performed in the exams. Each pile on the table\nrepresented a level of accomplishment in the jade disciplines. Au Sati, who\nstepped onto the stage to polite applause, had earned one jade stone, strung\nonto a metal chain. Grandmaster Le lifted it from the box and placed it over\nAu’s head. Au would become one of the lowest-ranked Fingers, or if he was\nbright enough with numbers, an entry-level Luckbringer.\n“Goro Gorusuto,” said Master Sain, calling up the next graduate as Au\nsaluted and stepped back off the stage. So it went, until the first group of\nboxes was cleared, and a larger grouping of graduates began coming up one\nat a time to receive two stones of jade each.

For some of the young men and\nwomen graduating, the jade they were awarded today would be the only\ngreen they would ever wear. For others, it was merely the first of more to\ncome, with jade passed down through families, awarded by superiors in the\nclan, or most prestigious of all, won in duels and battles.\nWhen the higher-ranked students who’d each earned three stones began\nfiling across the stage, Anden found himself so nervous he could barely\nwatch. Dudo received his jade, then Pau and Ton, all of them breaking into\nsmiles once they’d gotten past the grandmaster and joined their fellow\ngraduates on the other side. The collection of boxes on the table grew\nsmaller. There were only a dozen or so boxes in the final pile containing the\nreward for the top students, the ones who’d earned the maximum of four jade\npieces—as much jade as one would expect on a senior Finger or a junior Fist,\nmore than most Kekonese and any foreigners could safely tolerate.\nPutting on that much jade ought to be easy for Anden now, after what\nhe’d been through. It would be a momentarily disorienting rush, like what\nhe’d experienced during training, nothing like the powerful, crippling high\nhe’d suffered in front of the Twice Lucky. Yet still, his fingers began to feel\nnumb and chilled, and his stomach clenched in craving and visceral\nreluctance. The grandmaster began calling up the final students. An\nespecially loud round of foot-stomping applause greeted Lott as he stepped\nup and bent his head for the grandmaster. Anden could hear his fellow\ngraduates nearby, already chatting, congratulating each other, discussing how\nthey’d have their stones reset, whether they wanted thumb rings or eyebrow\nstuds or other, more daring piercings. There was only one box left on the\ntable.\n“Emery Anden,” said Master Sain.\nThe chatter died as Anden stood up. Suddenly he felt as if he was in a\nwaking dream, a self-consciously fictive state in which he was doing\nsomething without believing that he was really there. His legs moved him\nforward, his shoes hit the steps, and when he reached the stage, he heard\nsomeone shout, “Kaul-jen!”\nApplause broke out, and other voices echoed the first. “Kaul-jen!”\nAnden paused, thinking the crowd was shouting for Hilo. When he\nrealized they were cheering him, heat flowed into his face. They’re saying I’m\na Kaul. A mixed-blood orphan like him, and they were placing him alongside\nLan and Hilo and Shae. It was the greatest flattery he could imagine, and he\nwas mortified. Because it wasn’t true; he wasn’t like them. As Grandmaster\nLe lifted out the four jade stones on a silver chain, Anden stumbled back as if\nthe box contained a venomous spider.\n“No,” he blurted.\nGrandmaster Le frowned, his motion arrested. “What do you mean, no?”\n“I don’t—” Anden choked out. “I don’t want to wear jade.”\nIn all his years at the Academy, he’d never seen the grandmaster entirely\ntaken aback, as he was now, his gray eyebrows like two bristly arches, his"

Master Sain and the other faculty members\nonstage looked at each other in bewilderment, but none seemed to know what\nto say. A graduate refusing his jade? Such a thing had never happened.\nAnden heard the stunned silence before the whispers of disbelief began to\nrise. He didn’t dare fix his eyes anywhere but at his feet; he was disgracing\nhimself, disgracing Hilo and Shae. Burning with shame, he clasped his\nshaking hands and brought them to his bowed forehead in a salute of deepest\napology before turning and descending the stage without speaking.\nHe had never seen Hilo so livid with confusion and rage. The Pillar came\nstraight for him as soon as Grandmaster Le brought the graduation ceremony\nto a quick and awkward conclusion. The crowd of watching clan members\nparted before Hilo in fearful haste. Hilo’s fingers locked around Anden’s\nbicep like talons. He dragged his unresisting cousin away from his fellow\ngraduates, around the back of the stage, putting several feet of distance\nbetween them and the silent stares of so many others. Hilo spun Anden to\nface him. “What do you think you’re doing?”\nAnden tried to speak, but when he opened his mouth, he didn’t know what\nto say. There seemed to be no way to explain what he’d done. Hilo’s hand\nwas still clamped around his arm, and through it, Anden could feel his\ncousin’s jade aura shrilling like a swarm of infuriated hornets. “I’m sorry,” he\nmanaged at last.\n“You’re sorry?” Hilo seemed unable to find words of his own for a\nmoment. “What’s this about, Andy? What’s come over you? You made a fool\nof yourself in front of the clan, in front of all your Green Bone brothers. You\nmade a fool of me.”\n“I’m not like you, Hilo,” Anden burst out, anguished. Everything he’d\nfeared about himself, every doubt he’d tamed with strict training and faith in\nthe clan, every nightmare involving bloody bathtub water and his mother’s\nscreams had seemed in one instant to rise out of that small box on the stage,\noverwhelming even the horrible knowledge that he was ruining all that he’d\never wanted. “I’m not someone who should have jade, who was ever meant\nto have jade. If I start wearing it today, I’ll only want more and more, as\nmuch as I had when I killed Gont. I’ll become worse than my ma, the crazy\nMad Witch; I know I will. I can feel it in my blood now, no matter what you\nsay.” He could barely breathe enough to speak. “You could dope me up on\nshine, on that poisonous Espenian stuff that killed Lan, but that’s not how I\nwant to live. I don’t want to be what you’re making me: a-a—”\n“A what?” Hilo demanded angrily. “A Green Bone? A part of this\nfamily?”\n“A weapon,” Anden finished in a whisper.\nHilo released him with a jerk and stepped back. His face contorted in a"

His face contorted in a\nbaffling mix of emotions, foremost among them hurt, his eyes widening in\ndeeply wounded surprise, as if Anden had pulled out a knife and cut him\nacross the cheek. Behind Hilo’s shoulder, Anden glimpsed Shae approaching,\nKehn and Wen following her but stopping some distance away, holding back\nfrom intruding.\nThe Pillar took a step forward and raised his hands to seize his cousin by\nthe shoulders. Anden flinched, certain for a second that Hilo would really\nhurt him now, but Hilo merely said, in a calm, forced voice, “This is my\nfault, Andy.” He gave Anden a firm shake to force him to look up. “That\nfight—it was too much, too quickly. And landing in the hospital afterward,\nthat was a scary thing. You scared yourself. I’m the one to blame, but I had to\ndo it, because we needed you. I couldn’t have done it myself, couldn’t have\nsaved the clan without you. We still need you.”\nAnden felt terrible guilt searing his face as Hilo said, in a quiet voice that\nwas both entreating and reproving, “You humiliated both of us just now, but I\nknow you didn’t mean to; I’m not going to hold it against you. Let’s go back\nout there together to find Grandmaster Le and get your graduation jade. It’s\nwhat you worked for all these years. We’ll forget this happened, and we’ll do\nit right this time, build you up slowly. You’re a member of this family, Andy.\nYou were raised to be a Green Bone.”\nAnden felt his resolve quaver, but then he shook his head vehemently.\n“I’m too sensitive to jade; it makes me too powerful. It makes me enjoy\nkilling too much.” He swallowed thickly. “The Mountain knows how much\nof a threat I am now. If I wear any green at all, Ayt will do whatever she can\nto have me killed, and I’ll have to kill so many others just to stay alive …”\nHis words were rushing out in a torrent of desperation. “And every time I\nkill, I’ll enjoy it, more and more, and earn more jade, and all the shine in the\nworld won’t help me in the end, I know it.”\nHilo threw up his hands. “The Mountain’s wanted me dead for years! We\nlive with death and madness angling for us, but we do what we have to do,\nwe deal with it! You think I had it any easier than you last week? I had to go\nthrough fucking jade withdrawal when I was most of the way to being a\ncorpse, and still wake up to be the godsdamned Pillar.” His voice rose; he\nforced it back down with visible effort. “Being powerful makes you a target,\nbeing a Kaul makes you a target, but a Green Bone never turns his back on\nhis family or his clan.” The light in Hilo’s dilated pupils was dangerous.\n“Think about what you’re doing, Andy.”\nShae appeared next to them suddenly.

She spoke in a voice that was low\nand resolute, and carried a current of cold reproach that she turned on her\nbrother. “This is Anden’s decision, Hilo. He’s graduated and taken oaths;\nhe’s a man now.”\n“Who do you think those oaths are to?” Hilo demanded. “Those are clan\noaths, made to the Pillar. They’re what we live and die by. If you do this,\nAndy, you’re betraying me.” The grimace on Hilo’s face was terrible. “How\ncould you say I made you into a weapon? Like I didn’t love you and treat you\nlike my little brother, like you were nothing to me but a tool? How could you\nsay that?” He took a step backward, shoulders trembling as if it was\nphysically painful to hold himself back from murdering his miserable cousin\nwhere he stood. His face and voice turned suddenly cold and remote with\nscorn. “You do this and you’re out of the family.”\n“Hilo,” Shae hissed, looking as if she would strike him. “Stop this.”\n“Hilo-jen …” Anden pleaded, his body turning cold.\n“Get out of my sight,” Hilo said. When Anden didn’t move, he roared,\n“Get out of my sight! You ungrateful, traitorous mongrel, I never want to see\nyou again!”\nAnden stumbled backward, stricken, the force of Hilo’s flushed fury\nstrangling whatever words might have tried to escape his throat. He turned\nand ran.\nHe ran until he left the grounds of the Academy. He tore off his graduation\nrobes and threw them into the dirt and kept running in his dress pants and thin\nshirt, muddying them as he scrambled through the forest of Widow’s Park\nwithout regard for direction. He ran until tears blurred his vision and exertion\nscalded his lungs and legs. When he stopped running, he kept stumbling and\npushing through the trees, as if he could escape what had happened, as if he\ncould lose his shame in the woods.\nWhen he emerged onto a main road, he saw where he was and he began\nrunning again. The cemetery gates were open for visiting hours, and he\npanted his way up the gravesite-cluttered hillside, half sobbing, until he\ncollapsed in a heap in front of Lan’s headstone at the foot of the Kaul family\nmemorial. “I’m sorry,” he gasped, trembling, the wind chilling the sweat-\nsoaked shirt to his skin. Fat raindrops had begun to fall, streaking the lenses\nof his glasses and plastering the hair to his head. Rain splattered the marble\nslab, darkening it from a whitish green to a color almost like dirty jade. “I’m\nsorry, Lan.” Anden sat and wept.\nWhen Shae showed up minutes or hours later, she was carrying a black\numbrella, which she held over him, letting the rain fall on her uncovered head\nas she stood next to him gazing at the family’s final resting place. “He\nwould’ve been proud of you, Anden,” she said matter-of-factly. “He was\nalways proud of you.”\nCHAPTER\n57"

She sat down at her desk, fingering the\ncorners of the stiff envelope, then tore it open and read.\nDearest Shae-se,\nI can’t tell you how much I regret having to betray your trust. I’ve\nalways done as Kaul-jen commanded in all things, and I can still say\nthat is true. I assume that you and Hilo are searching for me, and I\nexpect no sympathy or mercy should we meet again.\nTake care what you do now. Hilo may believe he has won, but a\nMountain is not easily pushed into the sea. There’s nothing I can do to\nchange the fate of your brother and poor Anden, but my heart aches to\nthink of anything bad happening to you. So consider this a sincere\nwarning from your caring uncle: Have a plan to escape Kekon quickly\nand on your own. Store away some money and use your Espenian\nconnections so no one in the clan knows. A good Weather Man is\nalways reading the clouds.\nWith fond regrets,\nYun Dorupon\nShae swiveled her chair around slowly to look out upon the city below.\nSpringtime warmth hung in the thin smog over the steady hum of the freeway\nand the bustle of the harbor; the air conditioning in Shae’s office came on\nwith a noisy chugging sound. She felt, suddenly, very aware of herself, of the\nflesh and blood, breath and aura that comprised her physical being, sitting\nhere in this office that had for so long belonged to the man who had written\nthe letter in her hands.\nShe and her family were alive on a day she had thought, a few weeks ago,\nthey would not be. No Peak had suffered, and was suffering still, but it hung\non, tenacious—as Green Bones and their ways had for hundreds of years. She\nread the letter through once again, then held the corner of it to a cigarette\nlighter and watched it burn down in the ashtray. I won’t run, Doru, not this\ntime—and I’m coming for you.\nSeventhday brunch service at the Twice Lucky was not as brisk as it had been\nin the past, but with the Docks back in No Peak control and violence on the\nstreets having settled down, business was returning to the popular old\nwaterfront establishment. Shae and Hilo sat across from each other in a booth\nsituated away from the rest of the diners. Kaul Sen’s wheelchair was pulled\nup to the end of the table. Kyanla, sitting next to him, adjusted the napkin in\nthe old man’s lap. Wen was not able to join them this morning.

He mumbled something that sounded like appreciation and\npatted her hand. These were the moments she looked for now: small things.\nReminders of the family patriarch she’d admired and loved, the man who’d\ninsisted she be no less a Green Bone than her brothers. Kaul Sen’s remaining\nfragments of lucidity might be as illusory and brief as the appearance of\npeace in the city of Janloon, but she appreciated both all the more for their\nfragility.\nThe Mountain had retrenched, shoring up defenses in Summer Park,\nSpearpoint, and the other southern districts that comprised its core territories.\nRumor had it that Ayt Mada had appointed a new Horn. Not Waun Balu,\nGont’s First Fist, as Hilo and almost everyone else had expected. Instead, Ayt\nhad traveled to Wie Lon Temple School outside of Janloon and recruited one\nof her father’s former warriors, Nau Suen. Nau had spent the last two years\nliving an undemanding life as a senior instructor at Wie Lon—a clan reward,\nit was generally suspected, for giving Ayt Mada’s ascension as Pillar his full\nand vigorous support, including slitting the throat of Ayt Eodo with\ncommendable alacrity. He was said to be a master of Perception.\nShae tried again to enjoy the meal and put the war out of her mind for a\nbrief spell. Across the table from her, Hilo plucked at the plate of crispy\nsquid balls. “These make it all worth it,” he said, a smile curving his lips but\nnot reaching his eyes. He was trying to be cheerful, but Shae was not fooled.\nHe had been beaten to within spitting distance of death by Gont and his men,\nand many weeks later, he still saw Dr. Truw regularly and tired easily from\nthe injuries he’d sustained, but that was not what ailed him. Her brother\ncarried a cloak of hurt over him, a sullen resentment that often flared into\nanger or self-doubt. He’d saved the clan but lost another brother.\n“You should forgive him,” Shae said. “Even if he can’t forgive you yet.”\nShe considered the irony of these words coming from her mouth. There had\nonce been a time when she’d been certain she never wanted to see or speak to\nHilo again, and here they were, Pillar and Weather Man of the clan.\nShe hadn’t been able to get Hilo to acknowledge any mention she made of\nAnden, and sure enough, her brother did not look at her or reply to this latest\nattempt. Shae kept trying; it was early yet. Lan had told her that after she left\nfor Espenia, Hilo hadn’t spoken about her for six months. “Don’t you want to\nknow where he is? Whether he’s somewhere safe?” She’d at least made\narrangements for that.\n“No,” said Hilo.\nAny answer was progress; Shae didn’t press further. After leaving her\ncousin broken-spirited but calm on the beach behind her mother’s cottage,\nshe’d spoken to Wen, who had spoken to Kehn, who had quietly sent two\nreliable guards to Marenia."

The left\nside of his head was bandaged with a thick wad of gauze. He carried a small\nblack wooden box, and his face was tight with a forced smile that did little to\nmask his extreme nervousness. “Kaul-jens,” he asked, “is everything to your\nsatisfaction?”\nHilo set aside his downcast manner and offered the restaurateur an\nexpectant smile. “Mr. Une, you know how happy I am to be back in one of\nmy favorite spots.”\nThe owner of the Twice Lucky flushed and bent at the waist as he set the\nsmall black box on the table in front of Hilo, as if humbly presenting him\nwith a special dish from the kitchen, except that the unopened box contained\nMr. Une’s left ear. A plea for the Pillar’s mercy, for having turned to the\nMountain. “I hope to continue serving you, Kaul-jen,” he said, his voice\ntrembling a little. He dabbed his brow as he bent to Shae and Kaul Sen as\nwell, including them in his appeal.\nHilo put his hand on the box and gently set it aside. Mr. Une sagged\nvisibly in relief; touching the box was a sign of the Pillar’s acceptance. Hilo\nsaid, soberly, “All’s forgiven, my friend. Sometimes even the most loyal and\ndevoted men make mistakes when they’re forced to make decisions under\nterrible circumstances.”\n“Yes, Kaul-jen,” Mr. Une agreed wholeheartedly, clasping his hands to\nhis head and touching his forehead repeatedly as he backed away. “Very true,\nindeed.”\nShae noticed her grandfather’s head beginning to droop. “Kyanla,” she\nsaid, “take Grandfather home. Hilo and I will be along later.”\nKyanla dabbed Kaul Sen’s mouth with a napkin and moved him back\nfrom the table. People fell silent for a moment as the wheelchair passed\nthrough the dining room. Some raised their clasped hands in respectful salute\nto the old Torch. When Kaul Sen and his nurse had gone, several people rose\none at a time from their seats and came to where Hilo and Shae sat.\n“Kaul-jens, we live near the Twice Lucky and it’s our favorite place to\neat, but we never came here while those dogs held it,” said Mr. Ake, father of\ntwo Fingers. “We’re so relieved there’s peace in the neighborhood again.”\nA couple, Mr. and Mrs. Kino, whom Shae recognized as Luckbringers in\nher office, slipped an envelope under her plate. “To assist Mr. Une with his\ntribute this month,” they explained. “We know the clan will help him with the\ndamages to the windows and the carpet.”\nA palpable current of relief was growing in the dining room, where the\nceiling fans spun through the muggy air blown in over the harbor where Kehn\nand his men patrolled. The patrons of the Twice Lucky had seen the\nrestaurant owner’s bandaged head, and they saw now the box sitting next to"

The patrons of the Twice Lucky had seen the\nrestaurant owner’s bandaged head, and they saw now the box sitting next to\nHilo on the table, and were comforted that the Pillar was merciful and had\nrenewed his endorsement. With the solidified confidence of the clan’s\nLantern Men, and the jade income from the Espenians, Shae allowed herself a\nstir of grim optimism. Perhaps Ayt’s ruthless vision—one clan over Janloon\n—would come to pass, but not, Shae vowed, in the way the Pillar of the\nMountain envisioned.\nHilo accepted all the respect paying with something approaching his usual\nrelaxed good humor. Presently, he said, “Please go enjoy your food. My\nsister and I have business to discuss,” and the impromptu line of clan\nloyalists dispersed and returned to their tables. The Pillar and his Weather\nMan were left alone to finish their meals and to speak on clan matters.\nEPILOGUE\nAlways Opportunity\nT\nhere’d been a man at the gravesite when Bero first went, a young man who\nstayed there a long time, but the second time Bero snuck into the cemetery\nwith Mudt, it was at night and the eerie hillside was empty. He found the\nright place easily enough. Due to space considerations, most Kekonese were\ncremated and their ashes entombed. Not many families were afforded full\nburial plots and large marble monuments.\nKaul Lanshinwan had been laid to rest near his war hero father. Bouquets\nof spring flowers, bowls of bright, waxed fruit, and sticks of burnt-down\nincense in small cups of sand had been left at the foot of the headstone by the\nclan faithful. Below the name and dates carved into the marble, there were\nonly two simple lines:\nBELOVED SON AND BROTHER.\nPILLAR OF HIS CLAN.\nWith a violent motion, Mudt spat on the grave and made to kick over the\nitems on the ground. Bero yanked him back and hissed, “Don’t be an idiot.\nYou want them to start guarding this place?” The boy pulled away from\nBero’s grasp but stopped trying to do damage. He stuffed his hands into his\npockets and glanced around the moonlit cemetery with sullen unease. Grave-\nrobbing was, after all, punishable by death.\nBero crouched down and ran his hands along the base of the monument.\nHe pressed his palms to the grassy earth and brought his cheek so close to the\nground he could smell the pungent odor of the moist dirt beneath the growing\nturf. Several feet below him lay the body of the man he’d killed, and Bero\nwas certain that buried with him was jade. Jade that belonged by right to\nBero. Now that he had the entire stash of shine safely stored away and the\nclan war had ebbed so Janloon was almost, it seemed for now, back to\nnormal, he could think on how to make his luck again.\nThere was always opportunity in this city.\nAcknowledgments\nFrom its inception, Jade City was such an ambitious passion project that I\noccasionally despaired of being able to do it justice. I hoped against all odds\nthat my abilities were up to the task of bringing to life on the page what was"

I hoped against all odds\nthat my abilities were up to the task of bringing to life on the page what was\nso clear in my imagination. If I have succeeded with the book you hold in\nyour hands, it is in no small part because of the support I had along the way.\nAfter reading a draft of this novel, my agent, Jim McCarthy, not only\npressed me to keep going, but also gave me such insightful and useful\nfeedback that I wrote back to him, “You are so damn right about everything.\nI hope I can pull this off.” We did. Thanks again, Jim.\nI could not ask for Jade City to have a better champion than Sarah Guan at\nOrbit. I knew I was in good hands when I discovered that Sarah not only\n“got” the book immediately but also could go down the delightful rat hole of\ndream casting the characters with me. I’m extremely fortunate to have such a\npiercingly keen editor guiding and sharpening my work.\nThanks as well to Tim Holman and Anne Clarke for bringing this series\ninto the Orbit family; to my UK editor, Jenni Hill, for shepherding Jade City\nacross the pond and elsewhere; Alex Lencicki, Ellen Wright, and Laura\nFitzgerald for raising a storm of marketing and publicity; Lauren Panepinto\nand Lisa Marie Pompilio for making the book look fantastic; Gleni Bartels\nfor paying attention to every production detail; and Kelley Frodel for her\ncopyeditor’s eagle eye. Tim Paul took my crude sketches of Kekon and\nJanloon and turned them into beautiful maps. I have no doubt left out others\nwho deserve to be mentioned; thank you all.\nThere is no substitute for reliable beta readers. Curtis Chen, Vanessa\nMacLellan, Carolyn O’Doherty, and Sonja Thomas gave me the brain\nexplosion required to revise this book into what it was meant to be. To my\nViable Paradise XVIII classmates: Thanks for all the support and\ncommiseration on Slack, and an extra shout-out to those who read and\ncritiqued the opening chapters of the manuscript in its early days: Amanda\nHelms, Annaka Kalton, Renee Melton, Benjamin C. Kinney, Steve Rodgers,\nShveta Thakrar, and especially Jesse Stewart, who told me in no uncertain\nterms on several occasions to finish this book.\nI am thankful to Elizabeth Bear, Tina Connolly, Kate Elliot, Mary\nRobinette Kowal, Ken Liu, Scott Lynch, and Fran Wilde for various\ninstances of advice and support. My writer friends who gather for lunch, meet\nup at cons, or stay in touch online: You continue to inspire and motivate me.\nIt’s still a thrill to see my books on bookstore shelves, and I’m particularly\nobliged to Powell’s in Portland and University Bookstore in Seattle for\nhosting my launches.\nJade City is very much a merger of Western and Eastern story influences;\nI credit my father for introducing me to both. I don’t remember when exactly\nI became a lifelong fan of gangster sagas or kung fu films, but I’m sure he\nplayed a part in it. Continued gratitude must be extended to my husband,\nNathan, who willingly and perilously agrees to be either a hard critic or a\nsympathetic ear whenever I need him to be.
