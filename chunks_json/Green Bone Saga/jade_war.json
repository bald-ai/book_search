        "text": "cemetery.\nThe groundskeeper, Nuno, met them at the gate five minutes before the official closing time.\n“Here.” He thrust a black garbage bag at Bero. “Be quick. Night security doesn’t arrive for another\nhalf hour.” The three of them were alone, but Nuno spoke in a hurried whisper. His eyes, in the sun-\nshriveled hollows of his face, darted fearfully about the shadows of the shrubbery and tombstones.\nThieves were the lowest sort of scum on Kekon, and grave robbers were lower than that. A bullet to\nthe back of the head, the bill for the expense sent to their relatives—that was the lawful punishment\nthey could expect to receive by morning if they were caught.\nBero took the plastic bag from Nuno. Ducking next to the stone wall, he pulled out two blue\nshirts and caps embroidered with the logo of Heaven Awaiting Cemetery. Hastily, he and Mudt put on\nthe shirts and set the caps on their heads. Nuno led them at a brisk walk up a switchbacked hillside\npath to one of the largest, most prominent memorials on the grounds. A new plot had been dug in\nfront of the looming green marble monument. Tomorrow, Kaul Seningtun would be laid to rest next\nto his grandson, Kaul Lanshinwan, former Pillar of No Peak, murdered and buried sixteen months\nago. Sixteen months! A frustrating eternity for Bero to scheme and wait for his jade.\nNuno had dug the new plot himself that afternoon; a tractor with a backhoe attachment still\nrested next to the grave. Bero stood at the lip of the neat rectangular hole in the ground. A breeze\nstirred the disturbed grass at his feet, raising the pungent smell of damp earth. A shiver of excitement\ntraveled up Bero’s spine. This was what he’d needed all along: for someone else to do most of the\nwork for him. The first time he and Mudt had snuck into the cemetery with shovels, they’d been\ninterrupted by a group of other drunken teens stumbling around after dark and scaring each other; the\nsecond time, it began pouring rain and they barely made a dent in the soggy earth before nearly being\ncaught by security. After that, Bero figured they had to be smarter; they had to come up with a better\nplan and wait for the right time to act.\nTo Bero’s surprise, Mudt crouched down and jumped into the empty grave first. The boy looked\nback up, wiping his hands, his ferrety eyes bright. Bero slung the duffel bag he carried off his\nshoulder and took out the tools he needed. He passed them down to Mudt, then followed, the soles of\nhis shoes thudding on freshly exposed dirt. For a second, the two teens glanced at each other, awed at\ntheir own conspiratorial daring. Then together, they began to attack the wall of the pit with shovels,\nburrowing like moles toward the neighboring coffin.\nNuno stood watch near the tractor, chewing a quid of betel nut and pretending to be taking a\ncasual break from the hard work of grave-digging. It was uncommon for him to need to bring out the\nbackhoe; most Kekonese were cremated and entombed in columbaria or buried in small plots dug by"

        "text": "backhoe; most Kekonese were cremated and entombed in columbaria or buried in small plots dug by\nhand. Due to space considerations, even wealthy families like the Kauls, who could afford full plots,\nwere buried with only a foot of space between caskets, so it was not long before Bero’s shovel struck\na hard surface in the wall of soil. Stifling a shout of triumph, he redoubled his efforts. Dirt flew; it\nstreaked his sweaty hands, and when he paused to wipe his brow, it left muddy tracks across his face.\nBero did not feel any fatigue at all, only exhilaration and nearly unbearable anticipation; surely it was\nbecause his rightful jade was so close now, calling to him from within the coffin of the man he had\nkilled.\n“Kaul Lan used to be the Pillar of the No Peak clan,” Mudt said in a hushed but eager voice,\nspeaking for the first time since they’d arrived. Mudt was only fifteen, three years younger than Bero,\nand his arms were skinny; he labored at their task, and his narrow face was flushed in the near dark.\n“He would’ve had more jade than just about anyone, wouldn’t he? More than the Maik brothers,\neven.” A vengeful glint shone in Mudt’s eyes. He had his own reasons for wanting jade.\n“You can bet on it, keke,” Bero answered, without shifting his attention.\nAn anxious edge came into Mudt’s whisper. “How can we be sure the jade’s even here?” Except\nwhen taken by an enemy in battle, a Green Bone’s jade passed to his family. Warriors were often\nburied with some ceremonial portion of their green, but Kaul’s casket might contain only a few\ngemstones, or nothing at all. Given the intense cultural and religious stigma against stealing from the\ndeceased, and the death penalty it carried, the effort and risk of grave robbing was rarely worth it,\neven for the most jade-fevered criminals.\nBero did not reply to Mudt; he couldn’t offer any reassurance other than that when he got a\ncertain feeling, he always listened to it. He had that feeling now, like fate was smiling at him. The\ncapricious tides of fortune pulled people this way and that, but Bero thought they took special notice\nof him, that he rode higher on them than most. Ah, he’d had plenty of bad luck in his life from the\nminute he’d been yanked squalling from his short-lived mother’s womb, but then again, he was alive\nwhen many others he knew were not—and now he was close to jade.\nThe side of the casket was visible now. What had once been a burnished cherry surface shone\ndull brown against black earth. The teenagers put down their shovels and tied kerchiefs tightly over\ntheir noses and mouths, then pulled on heavy work gloves. Bero picked up a cordless reciprocating\nsaw. “Hold up the light,” he said, his voice muffled by the cloth. Mudt’s narrow penlight came on; he\nplayed it over the side of the coffin. When Bero started the saw, its shrill chatter nearly made him\njump and drop the power tool on his feet. Mudt’s flashlight beam shook wildly before steadying"

Mudt’s flashlight beam shook wildly before steadying\nagain. Heart pounding against his ribs, Bero made a plunge cut into Kaul Lan’s casket and began to\nsaw.\nHe cut out an area roughly the size of a television screen, then turned off the saw and set it\ndown. With Mudt’s help, he hauled the piece of wood away. Dust and polyester batting came free and\nswirled in the air. An object dropped into the dirt at their feet. With a shout of elation, Bero dropped\nto his knees, barely restraining himself from seizing what he saw glinting like unearthed treasure\nunder the flashlight beam: a string of jade beads, each stone flawless and brilliantly green, separated\nfrom its fellows with short black spacers on a silver chain. A powerful Green Bone leader’s ornament\nand weapon, a part of his very identity. A priceless object that could not be bought except with blood.\nMudt recovered his senses first; he grabbed Bero’s shoulder and said, “It was sewn into the\nlining. There might be more.” They dug around further in the damaged upholstery and almost at once\nfound two leather forearm cuffs, studded with gems. Kaul had also worn a belt, heavy with jade;\nperhaps it was here as well, hidden elsewhere in the coffin.\nBefore they could search further, Nuno appeared at the edge of the grave, looking down from\nabove them, his leathery face twitchy. “You have to get out. I sent the guards to check a broken lock\non the back gate, but they’ll come back. We need to clean up this mess.”\n“Throw down the duffel bag,” Bero called.\nNuno did so. Bero and Mudt pushed the cut piece of casket wood back into place and packed as\nmuch of the damp soil around it as they could. It pained Bero deeply to think of the other jade stones\nthey might be leaving behind, but it was best to get away now, with what they had. He’d learned some\npainful lessons from being overambitious in the past. Careful not to touch the jade with his bare skin,\nhe wrapped the precious finds in several layers of burlap and stowed it in the duffel bag along with\ntheir tools. Bero wiped his caked hands on his pants, slung the bag over his shoulder, and reached out\na hand for Nuno to pull him out of the grave. The groundskeeper stepped back, his stained lips\ndrawing away from his teeth in disgust. “I’m not getting near stolen jade.” It was only because Nuno\nhad fallen into a considerable amount of debt that they’d been able to bribe him at all, with enough\nmoney that Bero had entertained long second thoughts over the amount of stashed shine he’d had to\nsell over the course of months to fund this venture.\nBero had Mudt lace his hands into a step and boost him out of the pit. When he’d scrambled\nsafely back to his feet, Bero looked down at the younger teen, standing in the dirt with his arm\noutstretched, and for a moment he was tempted to leave Mudt behind.

        "text": "safely back to his feet, Bero looked down at the younger teen, standing in the dirt with his arm\noutstretched, and for a moment he was tempted to leave Mudt behind. Now that he finally had his\njade, why split it with this boy? But Mudt might give him away if he was cast aside. Besides, he had\nthick blood, and he had been useful so far—Bero had to admit that.\nHe crouched down and helped Mudt out. Nuno started up the backhoe and used it to pack the\ndisturbed soil back into place. When he was done, the grave looked much as it had before. A keen eye\ninspecting the site would notice footprints in the dirt and an irregular, loose wall, but they weren’t\ncounting on scrutiny. Bero and Mudt untied their kerchiefs and wiped the sweat and mud from their\nfaces as Nuno led them briskly back down the hill. It was fully dark now, and no one was paying\nattention to them, but if someone had been, they would’ve seen what appeared to be a trio of\ncemetery maintenance workers finishing up for the day.\nAt the gate, Nuno said, “Give me back those shirts and hats, quick.” They tore off the soiled\ndisguises, stuffing them back into the garbage bag. “You got what you came for, didn’t you? Damning\nyour souls and all.” Nuno spat. “Now, about the other half of the money.”\nBero nodded and crouched down to unzip the side pocket of the duffel bag. From behind, Mudt\nswung with all his strength, hitting Nuno in the back of the head with the rock clutched in his fist,\nthen shoved him to the ground. Bero stood up with a compact pistol in his hand and fired twice,\nputting the first bullet in Nuno’s forehead and the second in his cheek.\nBoth boys stared dumbstruck for three or four long seconds after the sharp report of gunfire\nfaded. Rolled over, Nuno’s eyes were frozen open in alarm and surprise; the entry wounds were\nsurprisingly small, and the blood was already being sucked up by the dry ground.\nBero’s first thought was that the plan had worked surprisingly well and he was right to have kept\nMudt around after all. His second was that it was a good thing the groundskeeper wasn’t a large man\nor they would’ve had a real problem moving him. The two teenagers were panting and pouring sweat\nfrom exertion and fear by the time they dragged the body into a shallow hollow under the nearby\nshrubbery. Bero dug hastily through Nuno’s jacket for the man’s wallet. “Get his watch, too,” he\nhissed at Mudt. “Make it look like a robbery.” They snatched the key ring from the groundskeeper’s\npocket, then kicked leaves and branches over the body and ran for the gate. As Bero cursed and\nstruggled with the lock, Mudt bent over, gasping, hands on knees, the rolling whites of his eyes\nvisible under the greasy mop of his hair. “Holy shit. Holy shit holy shit holy shit.”\nThe gate swung open at last.

They pulled the heavy metal bars shut behind them and Bero\nclutched the duffel bag tight as they sprinted into the cover of Widow’s Park ahead of the guards’\nsweeping flashlights, toward the lantern glow of the city below.\nCHAPTER\n2\nThe Passing of the Torch\nK\naul Hiloshudon stood at the head of the vast assembly of mourners who’d come to offer their final\nrespects to his grandfather. There were a great many people paying close attention to him today, and\nthey would notice if he seemed distracted or agitated, so he kept his eyes fixed firmly on the coffin\ndraped in expensive white cloth and moved his lips dutifully to the penitents’ chanted recitations.\nStill, he found it difficult to pay attention to the service, impossible to gird his sense of Perception\nagainst the presence of so many enemies.\nHis grandfather had lived a long and important life. Kaul Sen had fought for the liberation of his\ncountry, and later, through politics and business and the great clan he built, he’d shaped the nation of\nKekon in lasting ways. At the ripe age of eighty-three, he’d passed away quietly in the middle of the\nnight, sitting in his usual chair by the window of the family house. A sign of favor from the gods,\nsurely. If, in the final years of his life, with dementia and declining jade tolerance, Grandda had\nbecome a cruel, unbearable old man made bitter by regret and loss, who had nothing but unkind\nthings to say about the leadership of the No Peak clan passing to his least favored grandchild—well,\nthat was something the average citizen did not know. For two days and nights, a great public vigil had\nbeen held in the Temple District, and it seemed to Hilo that half the population of the city had turned\nout for the funeral. The other half was probably watching the event on television. The death of the\nTorch of Kekon marked the end of an era, the passing of a pivotal generation that had secured\nKekon’s freedom from foreign occupation and rebuilt its prosperity. Every public figure of\nimportance was here to take part in such a profound commemoration—including Ayt Madashi.\nThe Pillar of the Mountain clan was standing on the other side of the crowd, in a long, white\njacket and white scarf, surrounded by her own people. Hilo could barely see her from where he stood,\nbut he didn’t need to; he could Perceive the distinctive density of her jade aura easily enough. The\nirony of her presence at the very place where Hilo’s elder brother Lan lay turning to dust in the\nground would’ve enraged Hilo if he’d allowed himself to dwell upon it, but he did not; he had no\nintention of giving his rival that satisfaction.\nYesterday, Ayt had issued a public statement praising Kaul Sen as a national hero, a father of the\ncountry, and the beloved comrade and friend of her late father, Ayt Yugontin—let the gods recognize\nthem both. She expressed sadness over the recent strife between the clans of these two great men; she\nhoped the unfortunate disagreements could be overcome so the country might move forward in the\nspirit of unshakable unity once demonstrated by the patriotic wartime brotherhood of the One\nMountain Society.\n“Bullshit,” Hilo had said.

        "text": "spirit of unshakable unity once demonstrated by the patriotic wartime brotherhood of the One\nMountain Society.\n“Bullshit,” Hilo had said. He did not for one second believe that Ayt Mada would ever abandon\nher goal to kill him and his family, to destroy No Peak and take unquestioned control of the country’s\njade supply. Blood scores were not erased by press releases.\n“It’s a good public relations move,” Shae had said. “Reminding people of Grandda’s partnership\nwith her father and thus associating herself with the legacy of all Green Bones.”\nBeyond that brief analysis, his sister had spoken little in the past seventy-two hours, even outside\nof the official two-day silent vigil. Hilo glanced at her standing beside him, her spine straight but the\npuffy circles under her eyes still visible under the white mourning powder that dusted her face. Her\nnormally sharp jade aura seemed muted. Shae had loved their grandfather, had always basked in his\nfavoritism. She’d wept bitterly upon his death.\nHilo returned his attention to the crowd. Other top leaders of the Mountain clan were in\nattendance; standing near Ayt Mada was a short man with slicked hair—Ree Turahuo, the clan’s\nWeather Man—and next to him, a man with coarse features and a closely trimmed salt-and-pepper\nbeard to match his hair. Hilo knew relatively little about Nau Suenzen, who had succeeded Gont\nAschentu as Horn of the Mountain, but rumors and spies told him that Nau possessed a reputation as\na devious guerrilla fighter who’d conducted sabotage missions and assassinations for Ayt Yu during\nthe Shotarian occupation. He’d been only twenty-three years old when the Many Nations War ended.\nHe did not appear, either from his unassuming appearance or the coolly bland texture of his jade aura,\nto be half as powerful or impressive as his predecessor. Hilo suspected this was itself a deception to\nbe concerned about.\nThe Deitist penitents in white funerary robes—two dozen of them, for such a large crowd and\nsuch an important funeral—concluded the long religious ceremony with several refrains of let the\ngods recognize him, which were echoed multitudinously by those gathered. Hilo closed his eyes,\nfocusing his fatigued Perception as he scanned through the mental noise of thousands of breaths and\nbeating hearts. There: Unseen somewhere behind the cluster of Mountain clan members was the\nfamiliar cloudy jade aura of a man he’d once called his uncle. The former Weather Man of No Peak, a\ntraitor to the Kaul family. Yun Dorupon was here, and he was grieving.\n“Don’t bother. We won’t get to him today,” Shae said in an undertone. Perhaps she’d seen the\nlook of concentration on his face, or simply Perceived his animus, but Hilo was surprised. He hadn’t\nthought that she’d noticed Doru, that she was paying any attention at all.\nShe was right, of course; they could not act in violence in the presence of penitents on the day of\ntheir grandfather’s funeral, but more pragmatically, there were too many of the Mountain’s warriors\npresent—hundreds of their Fists and Fingers arrayed across from No Peak’s own.

When Hilo widened\nhis Perception, the auras of all the Green Bones in attendance created a heavy buzz of jade energy like\nthe ceaseless chatter of a busy street. The clans were making a show of strength with their respective\nnumbers, but today they stood in truce to honor the same man.\nThe huge gathering began to disperse. Hilo braced himself for the long, unavoidable task of\nputting on a solemn countenance and accepting condolences from the clan’s inner circle of influential\nloyalists—Lantern Men, politicians, prominent Green Bone families. Earlier on, some disquiet\nseemed to be going on near the entrance to the grounds, and Maik Kehn had sent one of his Fists to\ninvestigate. Now Kehn appeared at Hilo’s side and said in a low voice, “There’s talk about a dead\nbody being found in the cemetery last night.”\nHilo’s mouth curved. “Only one? Did the others get up and leave?”\nThe Horn snorted—as much of a laugh as Hilo ever got out of him, though his broad shoulders\nrose in amusement. “The groundskeeper was discovered shot in the head near the gate. Over his\ndebts, they say. Doesn’t seem all that important, but you know how some people are, crying bad luck\nover a fly in a cup of hoji.”\nHilo nodded. There ought not to be any negative news to taint the Torch’s funeral. “Talk to the\ncemetery manager and quiet it down.” He glanced reluctantly at the long line of well-wishers he had\nto face. He could no longer Perceive either Ayt or Doru anywhere nearby. “Tell Tar to give me an\nhour; then I’m going home, no matter how many ass kissers are still here.”\nTwo and a half hours later, Hilo arrived back at the Kaul estate. There were cars parked all the way up\nand down the long driveway and in the roundabout; the public funeral was being followed by a\nprivate reception reserved for family members and the highest-ranked Green Bones of No Peak.\nThrough the half-open car window, Hilo could hear music and smell barbecue coming from the\ncourtyard. Living into one’s eighties was supposedly a cause for celebration; it was considered as a\nsign of achievement in the Divine Virtues and a mark of the gods’ approval, guaranteeing admittance\nback to the fold of Heaven on the promised day of the Return. Hilo thought it was one of those beliefs\nthat must’ve made more sense in a time of warfare and poor medical care, but nevertheless, now that\nthe official mourning for Kaul Sen was over, the white drapery had come down and the more informal\ngathering had a somewhat festive air. It was bound to go on for some time.\nMaik Tar drove the Duchesse Priza straight up to the front of the main house. Hilo’s Pillarman\nput the car into park and turned over his shoulder. “Those people you agreed to see today, Hilo-jen,\nthey’re still here. You want me to send them in to you, or get rid of them?”\n“Where’s my sister?” Hilo asked. “Did she come back already?”\n“She’s waiting for you inside.”\nResigned, Hilo stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray. “Send them in.”"

You want anything in\nparticular?”\n“Some of the smoked pork.” Hilo got out of the car, walked into the house, and reluctantly went\ninto the study. It had once been Lan’s favorite room, and Hilo still did not feel entirely comfortable in\nit. He had finally made some changes—removing some of the bookshelves and putting in a television\nand a larger minibar, bringing in more comfortable armchairs—but every time he used it, the officious\nroom reminded him unkindly that he’d never been the intended Pillar of the clan.\nSo ordinarily, when he met with his own subordinates, Hilo preferred the kitchen or the patio,\nbut those were not private at the moment, and he had to admit that the study communicated a sense of\nformal authority that made it more appropriate for meeting with the clan’s stakeholders and\npetitioners—people with whom he knew he needed to downplay his youth and street reputation and\nemphasize his family’s power and legacy.\nShae was already in the room, sitting in one of the leather armchairs. She’d washed off her face\npowder, redone her makeup, and changed into a dark skirt and beige blouse, but her eyes were sunken\nand tired, and seemed almost accusing. Didn’t you love Grandda at all?\n“You don’t have to stay,” Hilo told her. “I can handle this myself.”\nShae said, “What if a Lantern Man asks you to pressure the Royal Council regarding the\nupcoming bill on limiting fuel surcharges?”\nHilo narrowed his eyes. “No one will ask me that.”\n“You’re right,” she said. “There is no upcoming bill on fuel surcharges. I made it up just now.”\nHer smile was thin, and her needling held little of its usual thrust. “I’ll stay.”\nHilo frowned but refrained from replying, only out of consideration for her grief. It was true that\nhe didn’t know the business and political issues of the clan as well as she did, but pointing it out was\nthe sort of cutting unkindness that his sister must’ve inherited from Grandda.\nHilo had barely taken off his tie and unbuttoned his collar when Tar knocked on the door and\nopened it to admit a man accompanied by a woman with a baby in her arms. At the sight of them,\nHilo brightened at once and went to embrace the man warmly. “Eiten, my friend,” he said. “Your\ndaughter’s grown huge! Is she really only nine months old? She could wrestle a two-year-old to the\nground.”\nEiten could not return the Pillar’s embrace, nor raise clasped hands to his forehead in the\ntraditional respectful salute, but his eyes shone with pride at Hilo’s words and he tilted into a slight\nbow. He wore a crisp, white, short-sleeved shirt that covered the stumps of his missing arms, and soft,\nslip-on black sandals. “She’s a terror, Hilo-jen; she cries for hours and refuses to be put down for a\nminute.” He shook his head morosely but did not sound at all unhappy."

He saw Eiten’s wife nod and\nsmile. The old belief that fussy infants grew up to be better warriors used to apply only to boys, but\nthese days, twenty percent of the students in Kaul Dushuron Academy were female; there were\nwomen Fists and even a woman Pillar—a colicky baby girl was cause for pride, not consternation. “I\nonly worry she’ll be too green to be married,” said Eiten’s wife. Hilo caught her gaze flickering\nbriefly toward Shae before dropping.\n“Maybe by the time she grows up, people won’t think that way anymore,” Shae said with a small\nsmile.\n“The Weather Man is right, and besides, it’s too early to worry about that now,” Hilo said,\nplacing a hand on Eiten’s shoulder and leading the family toward the chairs. A brown monkey\nscampered behind Eiten’s heels. When Eiten sat down, it jumped onto the armrest and sat perched\nbeside him alertly, scratching its chest. Hilo pulled a few bottles of soda from the mini-fridge and\nplaced them on the coffee table. At a word from Eiten, the monkey hopped onto the table, uncapped\none of the soda bottles, inserted a straw, and carried it back to its master. Eiten slid one foot from his\nsandal and held the neck of the bottle firmly between his toes. A jade bracelet hung from the ankle he\nrested across his opposite knee.\nHilo sat down across from his former Fist. His voice took a serious turn. “How’re you\nmanaging? Is there anything else you need from the clan that would be of help?”\n“You’ve done a lot for us already. Life has been hard, but it’s gotten easier since we got Zozo; he\nopens doors, he buttons my shirts, he even wipes my ass for me,” Eiten said with a chuckle. A Finger\nin the clan had given Hilo the useful lead about a Shotarian organization that trained monkeys to aid\nthe disabled (there were a lot of war veterans in that country), and Hilo had had a Lantern Man make\nthe arrangements.\nEiten bent forward to sip from the soda straw. When he straightened back up, he matched the\nPillar’s gaze squarely. “When Gont Asch took my arms, you promised me that you would kill him and\ntake his jade—and you did as you said. You told me to stay alive for one year, so I could see the\nclan’s vengeance, and see my child be born, and after a year, if I still wanted to die, you would honor\nmy wishes yourself.” The man’s voice turned rough but did not waver. “A year has passed and I’m\nsitting in front of you, Hilo-jen. If I asked you to fulfill your promise to me without question, would\nyou still do it?”\nEiten’s wife clutched their sleeping child tight and bent her head, biting her lips.

Her husband\ndid not look at her or the baby; his eyes remained on Hilo, who Perceived a strange and poignant\ninsistence in the hum of the man’s jade aura. “Yes,” Hilo said. “As I promised.”\nEiten nodded. His aura relaxed and settled; he looked over at his slumbering daughter and his\nface softened in obvious adoration. “You were right, Hilo-jen; I have things to live for now and don’t\nwish to die anymore.” But it had been important, Hilo understood, for the man to know that the\noption had been there, that the decision had truly been his, and that the Pillar’s word could always be\ncounted on. Eiten looked back at him. “Still, I don’t want to spend the rest of my days idle and\ndependent. I used to be a first-rank Fist of No Peak. I realize that I’m not of any use to you anymore,\nbut if you’ll hear me, I’ve come to ask you for a favor.”\n“Ask for whatever you need,” Hilo said. “I’ll happily grant it if I can.”\n“My father-in-law makes hoji. His distillery is small, but it produces some of the best liquor in\nthe country, and he sells it to upscale stores and restaurants. He wants to expand into a bigger\nlocation, but he’s getting old and needs a partner to run the company. I realize this would be a small\nthing to the clan, but I ask for the Weather Man’s office to offer patronage for me to take over my\nwife’s family’s business. My body may not be whole, but my mind is, and I think I could find\nsatisfaction in growing the company, as a Lantern Man of the clan.”\nHilo turned to the man’s wife with a smile. “What do you think of this idea, Mrs. Eiten? Does\nyour husband have what it takes to be a world-class hoji maker?”\n“We’ve both helped my father with the distillery for years, and he’s always wished we would\ntake it over at some point,” said Eiten’s wife, speaking quietly but confidently. “But my husband was\na Fist, devoted to you and the clan, so of course that came first. I’m grateful he’s alive at all—thanks\nonly to you, Kaul-jen—and I feel in my heart that this is our second chance. He would do well at it,\nand once our daughter is older, I would help too, of course.”\n“You said you needed a new location,” Hilo said, speaking again to Eiten. “The entire lower\nlevel of the Double Double is being renovated and expanded. We could make space for your distillery,\nand there’s an ample cellar. Would that do? You’d supply hoji to all the betting houses on Poor Man’s\nRoad.”\nEiten’s eyes widened. “Hilo-jen, that’s far more than we could expect…”\n“I need someone I trust in that part of the Armpit district,” Hilo went on. “There’s always the\nrisk that the Mountain will try to take back what we won from them last year. The Horn sees to it that\nthe area is always protected, but I’d feel better if I had a trustworthy Green Bone inside the premises,"

The Horn sees to it that\nthe area is always protected, but I’d feel better if I had a trustworthy Green Bone inside the premises,\nkeeping his eyes open and one ear to the ground. Could you make your fine hoji and still serve the\nclan, Eiten-jen?”\nEiten swallowed thickly and nodded. “The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master. Thank\nyou, Hilo-jen. I will always be one of your warriors, in any way you ask of me.”\nHilo grinned and stood up; the others stood with him. The motion woke the baby, who rooted for\nher mother’s breast and began wailing at a piercing volume that made Hilo wince, then laugh. “Go\non; you need to feed your little demon. We can sort out the details later.”\n“Gather your father-in-law’s past five years of financial records and send them to the Weather\nMan’s office along with the details of the patronage request,” Shae said. “Then we can move it along\nquicker.”\nEiten and his wife reiterated their gratitude. The brown monkey drank the last bit of peach soda\nin its master’s bottle and scampered close behind his heels as the family departed.\nSeeing Eiten doing as well as could reasonably be hoped for, and being able to fulfill his request,\nimproved Hilo’s mood considerably. The next two meetings were straightforward. The minor Black\nTail clan had sent a representative to deliver condolences in the form of money and flowers, and to\nexpress Black Tail’s unwavering and continued friendship. (“He’s likely heading over to Ayt Mada\nright now to say the exact same thing,” Shae said after the man left.) Then came a business associate\nof their grandfather’s, wanting to write a hagiographic biography of the Torch of Kekon, with the\nPillar’s permission and the clan’s final approval, of course. Hilo was pleased with their progress and\nlooking at his watch when Mrs. Teije was shown into the room.\nImmediately, he had a feeling that he would not enjoy this conversation. Behind him, he felt a\nsubtle shift in Shae’s aura that suggested she felt the same way. “Aunt Teije,” Hilo said, kissing the\nwoman on one dry cheek, “it’s been such a long time.” Not nearly long enough, he thought, glad that\nthe woman wore no jade and couldn’t Perceive any of his true sentiments.\n“Auntie,” Shae said, also faking a warm welcome. Mrs. Teije was sixty years old and the wife of\ntheir father’s cousin. Kaul Sen had had only one older sister who survived until adulthood; she\nmarried a man named Teije Jan and had four children by him. The Teijes were related to the Kauls\nand outnumbered them; this fact alone should have made them one of the most powerful families on\nKekon, but no Teije had ever achieved anything noteworthy or held a position of real leadership in the\nclan. Only a handful of them had graduated from the Academy as Green Bones; to Hilo’s recollection,\ntwo had made it as far as being junior Fists. The rest of the Teijes were an assortment of minor\nLantern Men and jadeless civilians—some with an education and respectable jobs, some not, almost"

So be kind to your cousins; if the Teijes had more brains or\nthicker blood, who knows where we’d be?”\nMrs. Teije was a plump woman with short, coarse hair and a tight-lipped expression that\nsuggested she was constantly trying to swallow something unpleasant in her mouth. In a wheezy\nvoice, she said, “Kaul-jen, Kaul-jen, may the gods shine favor on you. You are my only hope,” and\nsank into one of the chairs, dabbing at her eyes with a crumpled tissue.\n“What’s the matter, Auntie?” Hilo asked.\n“It’s my good-for-nothing son, Runo,” Mrs. Teije said. “He’s gotten himself into some trouble in\nthe Uwiwa Islands. Only the gods know what he was doing in that sinful place to begin with, but\nbecause of some terrible mistake, he was arrested and thrown into prison.”\nHilo suppressed a sigh and composed his face into a reassuring expression. “Aunt Teije, no\nwonder you’re so upset, but if it’s a mistake as you say, I’m sure it can be resolved, and we can pay to\nhave Runo released. How much is the bail amount?”\n“Ah,” said the woman, looking embarrassed, “the bail has already been paid and he was released\ntwo weeks ago.” When Hilo looked confused, she continued in a rush, “We didn’t pay it; our family\nwas collecting the money, but before we could do so, we heard that the bail had been posted by a\nwealthy stranger and Runo released to his custody.”\n“Who’s the stranger?” Hilo asked.\n“His name is Zapunyo,” said Mrs. Teije. “They say he is a bad man, a smuggler. A jade\nsmuggler.” She looked as if she would spit, if she wasn’t in the Kauls’ nicely carpeted study. “My son\nis being kept as a ‘guest’ of this man, who will not release him. We have tried to negotiate, to offer\nmoney, but this Zapunyo says he will only talk to the Pillar of the clan.”\nAunt Teije left her chair and knelt in front of Hilo, grasping him by the hands. “Please, Kaul-jen,\nyou must get Runo back. He has a troublesome, wayward heart, but he is a good boy. My husband\nrefused to come to you—curse his stubbornness! ‘If we ask the Kauls to help us with our own\nmatters, they’ll always look down on us,’ he says, but I don’t care. I know that you’re as big-hearted\nand caring as your grandfather—let the gods recognize him.”\nHilo winced inwardly at the comparison but patted the woman’s clutching hand. He did not look"

He did not look\nat Shae, but he could feel her aura prickling warily as she watched the exchange. He considered Mrs.\nTeije’s plaintive face for a long minute before making up his mind. “Don’t worry, Auntie. I’ll do\nwhatever I can to make sure Runo is freed and returned to you. What would the No Peak clan be\nwithout the Teije family? I’ll go to the Uwiwa Islands myself to speak to Zapunyo.”\nMrs. Teije let out a sob and touched her clasped hands to her forehead over and over. Hilo raised\nher to her feet and showed her out, rubbing her bowed back with his hand. Then he closed the door\nand turned around to face his sister, who had not moved from her spot in the chair near his. Shae\ndidn’t look pleased. “You shouldn’t have raised her hopes like that.”\nHilo dropped into a seat across from her and slid down low into it, legs outstretched. “What was\nI supposed to do? Send her away thinking we’d let that Uwiwan crook take her son without\nconsequence? He’s a member of the family after all, a Green Bone.”\nShae squinted. “You’re not seriously going to risk your own life for Teije Runo.” Runo had been\nthree years ahead of Hilo and Shae at the Academy; he’d been good at singing, relayball, maintaining\na revolving list of girlfriends, and not much else. He’d graduated with a single jade stone and earned\nanother during his two years as a Finger before deciding to travel and see the world while seeking his\nfortune. According to clan gossip, as a Green Bone for hire, Teije had guarded mining and oil-drilling\nprojects in war-torn parts of the world and spent time as a personal bodyguard to some rich oligarch\nin Marcucuo. Hilo had not seen the man for years and had no desire to; he had no respect for any\nperson who used his jade abilities for personal gain and gave nothing back to the clan to whom he\nowed his green.\n“I couldn’t care less about Runo myself,” Hilo said, “but you know this isn’t about him at all.\nClan war has been good for the jade smuggling business, and that scavenger Zapunyo has gotten fat\nand bold in the past couple of years. With the news out of Shotar these days, he’s got even more\nreason to think the black market’s going up.” A separatist conflict had broken out in Shotar between\nthe country’s government and a pro-Ygutanian insurgency in the easternmost province of Oortoko.\nThe major world powers were likely to get involved and escalate the armed crisis—which meant\ngreater demand for jade, from both legitimate and illegitimate military forces around the world.\n“Hilo,” Shae said seriously, “Zapunyo is trying to force a meeting under his terms, in his\ncountry, where he has the corrupt government and the police on his payroll. You’d be walking into\ncertain danger if you went there. It’s not worth it, not for the sake of that useless ass Teije Runo.”\n“But he’s our family’s useless ass,” Hilo said, standing and stretching.

The outward marks of the vicious beating he’d taken at\nthe hands of Gont Asch and his men more than a year ago had long since faded, but his body still\ninsisted on offering unwelcome reminders. “How does it look, to have an Uwiwan holding a\nKekonese Green Bone hostage, one of our own blood relations? Zapunyo knows we won’t stand for\nit. This is his way of getting my attention.”\n“Send Kehn or Tar to deal with him.”\nHilo shook his head. It was the Weather Man’s job to counsel the Pillar with a shrewd and\nlogical weighing of costs and benefits, so Shae was only doing her job in advising caution, but she\nhad never been on the military side of the clan and so there were things she didn’t appreciate. Hilo\nhad not established his personal reputation by remaining behind and sending others to handle\nimportant matters; he was not about to lapse now, not when he was relying on his notoriety as the\nformer Horn to carry him as a wartime Pillar. “I need to talk to Zapunyo myself,” Hilo insisted. “A\nmisunderstanding between friends is okay. A misunderstanding between enemies isn’t.”\nShae seemed about to argue further, but at that moment, Tar knocked on the door and opened it\njust far enough to stick his head through and say, “It’s getting dark, and this thing in the courtyard’s\nwrapping up. What do you think, Hilo-jen? You still want to talk to Anden?”\nA change came over Hilo; his mouth turned down and his shoulders stiffened, as if a weight had\nfallen onto them. “I’ll talk to him,” he said quietly. He looked at Shae. “Alone.”\nTar departed. Shae got to her feet. “I’m the one who convinced you to speak to Anden in the first\nplace. You wouldn’t listen to me for months, wouldn’t even say his name, and now you want me out\nof the room.” She fixed her brother with an indignant and suspicious glare. “You’re going to try to\nthreaten or cajole him back into the clan, back into wearing jade. I know you, Hilo.”\n“I want to talk to him alone, Shae.” Hilo’s voice was hard now. “What happened that day was\nbetween us. We should have the chance to talk about it properly.”\nThe Weather Man regarded him for a long moment, her aura bristling. Then she walked past him\nto the door, exited wordlessly, and left the Pillar alone in his brother’s empty study.\nCHAPTER\n3\nExile\nE\nmery Anden sat on the bench under the cherry tree in the courtyard of the Kaul estate, nursing a\nbottle of lime soda and avoiding eye contact with the other funeral reception guests.

The only thing that marred the\ntasteful event was the temporary blue plastic fencing on one side of the courtyard that cordoned off\nthe construction site where the Weather Man’s residence was being stripped down to its frame and\nrenovated.\nAnden could not claim to have been close to Kaul Sen, but the man had been his adopted\ngrandfather and had given him everything: made him a part of the Kaul family and sent him to be\neducated at Kaul Dushuron Academy in the same manner as the Torch’s own grandchildren. Ever\nsince he was a child, Anden had assumed he would one day repay the patriarch by becoming a first-\nrank Green Bone of the No Peak clan. Now Grandda was dead, and Anden’s debt to him would\nremain unpaid.\nThe late-afternoon shadows thickened and the crowd thinned and still Anden waited. He got up\nto get another soda from the beverage table and was aware of all the shoulders and chins that turned,\nall the interested and unkind eyes that followed him. Most of the upper echelon of No Peak was here.\nThey knew who Anden was and what he had done last year: helped to save the clan from destruction,\nthen on the day of his graduation, refused to wear jade and been publicly disowned by the Pillar.\nWith a jolt, he recognized a few of his classmates from the Academy—Lott, Heike, and Ton—\nstanding together near their families. They were speaking to each other and casting glances in his\ndirection. An echo of old feeling, numb with disuse, stirred in Anden’s chest. Lott Jin was leaning\ncasually against a table. He had not lost his slouchy, restlessly idle manner, but he appeared to have\nbeen working out over the past year; his shoulders were broader, filling out his gray suit jacket, and\nhe’d cut his hair so that it no longer hung in front of his hooded eyes.\nAnden averted his gaze, heat climbing into his face. There were times now, after living in\nMarenia for over a year, that he enjoyed his day-to-day life and could push away the memory of his\ndisgrace. Being back in Janloon, in this house and among the clan again, dragged him back to the\ndays and weeks after his exile and reminded him of everything he’d given up.\nAnden returned to his seat on the bench by the tree. To his horror, Ton crossed the courtyard.\nLott and Heike stayed behind, watching but not approaching. “Anden,” Ton said, touching his\nforehead in informal greeting. He cleared his throat. “It’s been a while. I’m glad to see you looking\nwell.”\nAnden reluctantly raised his eyes to his former classmate’s face. “It’s good to see you, Ton-jen,”\nhe said. Ton nodded and fiddled with the two jade rings on his left hand in nervous habit. He was a\nFinger in the clan now, answering to the Horn and his Fists, patrolling and defending No Peak\nterritory, maintaining the clan’s tenuous advantage over the Mountain. Ton looked as if he was fishing\nfor something else to say to break the awkwardness, but Maik Tar appeared and bent to speak quietly\nto Anden. “He’s ready to see you.”"

Tar closed the door behind him, shutting out\nthe background sounds of the people still mingling outside.\nThe Pillar was sitting in the largest of the leather armchairs. Kaul Hilo seemed both the same and\ndifferent from the last time Anden had seen him. He still possessed a youthful appearance, still\nexuded the casually insolent charisma that Anden had seen manifest as generous warmth with his\nfriends and fearsome menace with his enemies. But the mantle of Pillar left no man unchanged; there\nwas a stiffness to Hilo’s eyes and mouth now, a grimmer, more controlled aspect to his manner that\nAnden had seen little evidence of before.\nAnden looked for Shae, but she was not in the room. She was the only member of the clan that\nAnden had been in regular contact with over the past year. He’d hoped that she would be here. Anden\nswallowed. He brought his clasped hands up to his forehead and tilted into a formal salute. “Kaul-\njen,” he said. “I’m sorry for the loss of your grandfather.”\nThere was a time not long ago when Hilo would’ve risen and embraced his cousin warmly,\nkissed him on the cheek, and smiling, led him to the nearest chair. “Andy,” Hilo would’ve scolded,\n“don’t act like that; take the pole out of your ass and come sit down.”\nThe Pillar did not do that. He remained seated and said, with cool remonstration, “He was your\ngrandfather too, Andy, in every way but blood. He brought you into this family.”\n“I haven’t forgotten that,” Anden said quietly.\n“Haven’t you?” Hilo sat forward and picked up the package of Espenian-branded cigarettes lying\non the coffee table. He tapped one out for himself and put it in his mouth, then to Anden’s surprise,\nheld the box out to his cousin. Anden sat down and took a cigarette without meeting the Pillar’s eye.\nHilo lit his smoke, slid the lighter across the table to Anden, then leaned back in his chair again.\n“What have you been doing with yourself, Andy?” His voice was soft and reproachful. “Shae tells me\nyou’re living in Marenia. A nineteen-year-old man trained as a Green Bone, living in a village with\njadeless fishermen and seniors.”\nAnden hid the flush of his face by looking down as he lit his cigarette. “I have a job there,” he\nanswered. “It’s steady work and I can support myself. In another month, I’ll have saved up enough\nmoney to rent my own place so I won’t be a burden on your ma anymore.”\nHilo’s eyes blazed with sudden ire. “And what about the guards set to watch over you? Will your\nsalary from working in the furniture shop cover the expense of them as well?”"

Will your\nsalary from working in the furniture shop cover the expense of them as well?”\nAnden flinched at Hilo’s tone. “Kaul-jen, the clan shouldn’t make any special allowance for me.\nYou need every Green Bone you have in the war against the Mountain. No one’s come after me in\nMarenia, and if they do, it’s only right that I bear that risk myself.”\n“Don’t be stupid,” Hilo said. “You killed Gont Asch; you turned the war last year. You think Ayt\nMada will ever forget that?” Hilo sat forward again. “She knows you could become one of the most\npowerful Green Bones in the country.”\nAnden muttered, “Not if I never wear jade again. It would be against aisho to—”\n“Ayt will find a way around aisho if she wants to. She doesn’t need to send Green Bones with\nmoon blades against one jadeless man in a fishing village. She hasn’t whispered your name because\nthere’s no gain in it for her right now. Who knows, maybe she thinks that if she waits awhile, she can\nturn you.”\nAnden’s head shot up. “I would never turn to the Mountain, not if my life depended on it. I may\nnot be a Green Bone, but I wouldn’t betray the clan to our enemies.”\n“Did you say that to the man who approached you last month?”\nAnden did not reply, but the hand that held the cigarette shook a little. A stranger, a bald man,\nhad come up to him in the supermarket and said, with a confidential smile, “I admire what you did,\nrefusing to put on jade and become one of those Green Bone killers. You’re obviously a young man\nwith integrity. Even in this small town, people know who you are. If you ever need help finding a job\nor a place to stay, or could use a favor from a friend, you should feel free to call me.” The man had\nhanded Anden a business card with a phone number.\n“Shae looked into it. He has ties to the Mountain,” Hilo said. “They’re being patient, but\nsometime soon, they’ll make sure you have some unexpected trouble, and maybe you’ll call the\nnumber on the card. And if you don’t, you’ll have some worse trouble down the line.”\nAnden took a quick drag on his cigarette and ground it out. He saw now why he’d been asked\nhere at last: The Pillar might not have forgiven him, but neither did he want a member of his family,\ndisowned or not, to be left vulnerable and potentially manipulated by the enemy.\n“Andy,” Hilo said, and though his voice was still hard, there was a pained edge to it that made\nAnden finally meet his cousin’s eyes. The Pillar’s mouth twisted as he ground out his own cigarette.\n“You’re my brother; if you’d come to your senses, if you’d asked to return at any time this past year,\nif you’d spoken to me and admitted you made a mistake—the way I admitted I was at fault too—I\nwould’ve forgiven you at once. I’d have welcomed you back; how could I not? But you never did\nthat. You stayed away from the family and wasted a year of your life.”"

You stayed away from the family and wasted a year of your life.”\n“You said you never wanted to see me again,” Anden mumbled.\n“Who doesn’t ever say the wrong things when they’re angry?” Hilo snapped. “You humiliated\nyourself that day, humiliated the clan, and insulted me in doing it.”\nAnger and resentment rose and dispelled Anden’s guilt. “Would you have welcomed me back\neven if I refused to wear jade? Or am I only worth anything to you as a Green Bone?”\n“You were meant to be a Green Bone,” Hilo said. “You’re fooling yourself if you think\notherwise. Shae took off her jade and went away; she tried to pretend to be someone else and look\nwhat happened. If she hadn’t done that, maybe everything would be different. Maybe it would still be\nLan sitting in this room instead of me. Refusing to wear jade, you’re like a goose that won’t go near\nwater.” Hilo blew out a harsh sigh. “Don’t try to tell me that you don’t think about it.”\nHe did; of course he did. The memory of jade, of the power it had given him, the ecstatic terror\nof that last battle when he’d killed one of the most powerful Green Bones in Janloon—sometimes it\nstirred in him a longing that was almost sexual in its intensity, in its sheer animal hunger. Anden’s\neyes dropped involuntarily to the top of Hilo’s shirt, the first two buttons left undone as usual.\nLooking at the long line of jade stones studding his cousin’s collarbone, Anden felt conflicting fear\nand yearning pull his insides taut. He still wanted to be a Kaul.\nYet stronger than the craving loomed the specter of madness and a life lived in constant terror of\nhimself. Whenever he contemplated the idea of putting on jade again, black memories forced\nthemselves into his mind: his mother’s screams of insanity before her death from the Itches; Lan on\nthe last day Anden had seen him alive—worn down, volatile, and weakened from carrying too much\njade and drugging himself with shine; and Anden himself, after the battle with Gont, waking up in the\nhospital parched and feverish, half-mad with a thirst for jade and killing.\nHe shook his head. “I won’t do it, Hilo-jen. Jade will turn me into a monster. I’m still grateful to\nthe family and loyal to the clan; I’ll do anything you ask of me—except wear green.”\nHilo did not reply at first. Anden did not dare to say anything more, and the silence stretched\nbetween them. When the Pillar spoke again, his voice was resigned, devoid of the anger that Anden\nrealized had been a sign of how much he’d wished for a different outcome between them, how dearly\nhe’d hoped it would not come down to what he was about to say. “I’m sending you to Espenia. Shae’s\nmade all of the arrangements. You’ll leave next week.”\nAnden stared, not believing it at first. “Espenia?”\n“You’re no use to me here if you won’t be a Green Bone. You can’t stay in Marenia; I won’t"

You can’t stay in Marenia; I won’t\nhave you guarded day and night so you can carve rocking chairs and pick seashells on the beach\nwhile the Mountain decides when to make a move. If you won’t wear jade, you’ll need to do\nsomething else with your life. You’ll go to Espenia and get an education there.”\n“I’ve never been to Espenia,” Anden protested.\n“You’re half-Espenian. You should learn about that country, learn the language,” Hilo said.\nAnden was so astonished he couldn’t speak at first. Hilo had never pointed out his foreign side, never\nsuggested that Andy was not truly Kekonese and a full member of the Kaul family.\nThis sudden change, perhaps more than anything else, was so hurtful that Anden lost the rest of\nhis composure. “You want to be rid of me,” he choked out. “You’re exiling me.”\n“Godsdamnit, Andy,” Hilo snarled, “for the last time: Will you kneel and take your oaths again\nto me as Pillar, then put on your jade and be a Green Bone, a part of this family?”\nAnden clutched the arms of the chair, his jaw so tight he could feel the pressure in his eye\nsockets. If he opened his mouth, he wasn’t sure what would come out of it, so he didn’t let himself\nspeak. Hilo stood up. He walked over to the side of Anden’s chair and stood over him, his spine tense\nand his shoulders angled slightly forward, as if he wanted to reach down and grab his cousin, to\nembrace him or hurt him. Anden felt tears pricking the backs of his eyes. “Please, Hilo-jen,” he\nwhispered. “Don’t send me there. I hate those people and that country.”\n“You might like it when you get there,” Hilo said. “You won’t be all alone; the clan has\nconnections, and they’ll take care of you while you’re away from home. After a couple of years,\nyou’ll have options, and we’ll talk about them then.”\nHe supposed he could refuse. He could disobey Hilo a second time, insist on staying in Marenia.\nEven if a dull, routine life was all he could hope for there, at least he would be on Kekon and not in\nsome foreign country. But he was certain that Shae could not help him further if he did that. He would\ntruly be out of the family. Kekon was ruled by the clans; as a pariah, his future prospects were slim.\nWith Hilo standing so close to him, he could sense the edges of his cousin’s jade aura, could Perceive\nthe reluctant determination behind his words. Hilo had made his decision. He was the Pillar and, with\nthe death of Kaul Sen, the indisputable final word in the Kaul family.\nAnden got up and touched his clasped hands to his forehead in salute. “Whatever you say, Kaul-\njen.” His voice was dull. He didn’t dare to look at Hilo again as he turned and left the study."

He didn’t dare to look at Hilo again as he turned and left the study.\nIn a daze, he walked down the hall and saw Shae sitting on the steps of the main staircase in the\nfoyer. She looked strange sitting there by herself in the near dark, still in her business clothes, hands\naround her knees. She stood up when she saw him. Out in the lamplit courtyard, workers were\nbringing the leftover food into the kitchen and taking down the tables. They could hear cars departing\nfrom the driveway. “Anden,” she started.\n“You said you would talk to him,” Anden blurted in accusation. “You said you’d find a way for\nme to come back home. But it was your idea to send me to Espenia, wasn’t it?”\nShae blew out a breath. “It’s what we decided was best. You’ll be safer there, you’ll gain some\nexperience and skills. Espenia is our largest military ally and trading partner; it’ll be an advantage in\nthe long run for you to have spent time living and studying there. Afterward, when it makes sense for\nyou to come back—”\n“Did you think about what I want?” He was certain now that Hilo wouldn’t have done this to\nhim without the Weather Man’s urging. “Maybe going away was something you wanted to do, but I\ndon’t want to leave Kekon. I don’t care about Espenia or an Espenian education. I was never much\ngood at studying anyway, only—” Only jade. He’d been a prodigy when it came to the jade\ndisciplines.\nShae reached out and laid a hand on his arm. “You’re still young. You don’t know what else\nthere is yet.”\nAnden jerked away. “I wish I’d died that day in the fight with Gont.”\nShae dropped her hand. “Don’t say that.” Her reply was sharp, but Anden didn’t care that he’d\nupset her. He spun and left the house. He heard his cousin take two steps after him before she stopped\nand let him go.\nCHAPTER\n4\nDead Ends\nW\nell, that is very bad fucking news,” said Maik Kehn.\nThe manager of the Heaven Awaiting Cemetery lost the color in his face. His throat bobbed in a\nfearful swallow. “Maik-jen, we will, of course, arrange for reburial in a steel casket. The remains\nappear undisturbed; only the—”\n“They weren’t after the body,” Maik grumbled. “They got what they wanted.” It was not the\nmurdered groundskeeper that had raised suspicions, but the black garbage bag found near him,\ncontaining two heavily soiled cemetery staff uniform shirts and hats. That had motivated an\nexamination of the last grave the groundskeeper had dug—Kaul Seningtun’s—and led to the\ndiscovery of the loosely repacked dirt wall and Kaul Lan’s damaged casket behind it.\n“Double the number of guards you have,” Maik told the manager, “and tell no one of this.\nUnderstand?” The man nodded vigorously. The Horn felt no need to threaten him further; the\ncemetery would certainly not want word to get out that it had been infiltrated by grave robbers on\naccount of a bribed staff member.

        "text": "cemetery would certainly not want word to get out that it had been infiltrated by grave robbers on\naccount of a bribed staff member. Already the manager was tugging anxiously on his earlobe, perhaps\nto ward off bad luck, perhaps contemplating cutting off the ear entirely and sending it to Kaul Hilo to\nforestall the Pillar’s reaction. Kehn made a mental note to himself to increase the clan’s own security\nin Widow’s Park. Then he made two phone calls.\nThe first was to his girlfriend to let her know that he couldn’t see her today, as he would be\noccupied with clan business. Lina took the news with aplomb. She was a kind and practical woman,\nbeautiful in a simple way, robust and curvy in just the way Kehn liked, and most importantly, she was\nnot a Green Bone. Being the Horn of No Peak consumed most of Kehn’s waking hours; he didn’t\nneed jade in his bedroom as well. He’d seen how Tar’s relationships flamed out. Kehn had met his\ngirlfriend through his sister, Wen. Lina was a teacher at Janloon City College and came from a large\nfamily; she had her own life and career and friends, and little nieces and nephews to keep her busy, so\nshe wouldn’t be overly resentful that the Horn’s first priority was always the clan.\n“Will you still be able to come to my grandma’s eightieth birthday party on Fifthday?” Lina\nasked him over the phone. “My parents would be delighted if the Horn made an appearance.”\nSometimes it amused Kehn that people now invited him to all sorts of events and considered his\npresence a sign of clan favor and prestige. As a child, he’d rarely been invited to anything, as no one\nwished to associate with the disreputable Maik name. The Maik family’s rise was something of a\nfairy tale within No Peak, spawning admiration and jealousy and an increasing number of social\nobligations. “Maybe,” he said noncommittally.\nKehn’s second call was to his brother.\nTar swore long and vociferously and then said, “We’d better tell him together.”\nKehn agreed; he was already thinking about how best to break the bad news to his boss. Hilo-jen\nexpected to be told important things right away, but he also didn’t like to be informed of problems\nwithout hearing what was being done to solve them. Otherwise, he might step in and handle it\nhimself. Although Kehn appreciated the Pillar’s continued involvement in the military side of the\nclan, it would be impossible to command as Horn if his own Fists kept going straight to Hilo-jen the\nway they used to. Over the past year, Kehn had begun making more of an effort, where possible, to\nkeep the Pillar from the Horn’s job.\nSo later that afternoon, he started the conversation off on a positive note. “I finished assigning\nthe new Fingers we got out of the Academy this year,” Kehn said. “Put most of them in the Docks and\nthe Armpit, where the Mountain’s more likely to try something. Also Junko and the Forge, where\nwe’re seeing trouble with smuggling and shine dealing. Handed out promotions too—about half of\nthe big Academy class we took in last year went up to third or second rank.”"

        "text": "we’re seeing trouble with smuggling and shine dealing. Handed out promotions too—about half of\nthe big Academy class we took in last year went up to third or second rank.”\nHilo nodded and asked for details, but didn’t crack a smile. The Pillar had been morose ever\nsince Kaul Sen’s funeral. Perhaps the old man’s passing bothered him more than he let on. Or maybe\nKehn’s mention of the Academy graduates reminded the Pillar of his kid cousin Anden, whom he’d\nhad to send away.\nAfter they’d discussed business a while longer, Kehn and Tar shared a glance. Tar motioned for\nthe waiter to refill their water glasses. Hilo ate the last crispy squid ball on the plate, then looked\nimpatiently between the Maik brothers. “Stop acting like nervous schoolgirls and get around to it,\nthen. What haven’t you told me?”\nKehn explained that the Kaul family gravesite had been robbed. He could usually keep calm and\nsay things matter-of-factly even in bad situations, so it was better that he did the talking instead of\nTar, even if the matter would likely fall to his brother to deal with in the end. As Kehn spoke, Hilo\ngrew unnervingly still and quiet. The three of them were in a private booth in the Twice Lucky\nrestaurant during the middle of a Firstday afternoon, so there was no one around to overhear, but\nKehn could not help casting a glance around, in case there were other Green Bones in the dining\nroom who might Perceive the Pillar’s jade aura flaring like a grease fire.\n“I’ve posted people around Widow’s Park,” Kehn said. “We’re talking to anyone who knew the\ndead groundskeeper and getting the word out to our informers—not giving them details, but we’ll\nhave them watching. Maybe someone in the Mountain is trying to lay claim to Lan-jen’s jade.”\n“I can’t believe it was the Mountain,” Tar put in. “What kind of Green Bone would stoop so\nlow? Or be so shoddy as to leave a body and discarded disguises almost in plain sight?” He palmed a\nfew of the roasted nuts from the dish in the center of the table. “If the Mountain wants to start\nsomething with us again, there are a thousand other ways for them to do it. Ayt’s a cunning bitch, and\nwho knows about Nau, but they wouldn’t touch a dead man’s jade.”\nThe Pillar still hadn’t uttered a word or moved. Kehn said, “Whoever the thieves are, if they try\nto move that amount of jade on the black market, we’ll know about it.”\nHilo spoke at last. His voice was chillingly soft at first. “The only people who knew that Lan was\nburied with his green have the names of Kaul or Maik. Except for the dogfucking piece of shit who\nambushed and killed him. Some hired goon, some nobody.” The Pillar’s voice rose to a shout and his\nhand came down hard on the table, making the plates jump. His aura churned so violently that both of\nthe Maik brothers had to resist the urge to edge back from the table. “We thought he was long gone\nfrom the city or that the Mountain already killed him, but he’s still alive. And he has Lan’s jade.”"

And he has Lan’s jade.”\nThe Maiks were silent. Tar would not look the Pillar in the eye. A year ago, Hilo had tasked the\nPillarman with locating the remaining owner of the machine gun left at the scene of Lan’s murder. Tar\nhad accomplished nearly all the other things Hilo had set him to, mercilessly rooting out dozens of the\nMountain’s informers and jade-wearing criminals from No Peak’s territories—but that particular bit\nof clan justice remained undelivered.\n“The Mountain may not have been behind this.” Hilo pinned his brothers-in-law with his stare.\n“But they sent assassins after Lan and someone in that clan knows who the thief is. It doesn’t matter\nwho you have to go through—find the fucker. And tell me once you do.”\nMaik Tar rededicated himself to the task the Pillar had given him. There had been two Fullerton\nmachine guns and the body of one teenager discovered at the pier on the night of Lan’s murder. Some\nmonths ago, after considerable legwork, Tar had identified the dead young man as a member of a\nrobbery ring based in the Docks and run by a Mountain informer named Mudt Jindonon. There was a\ngood chance the surviving assassin had been part of that same gang. The problem was that Mudt Jin\nwas dead; Tar had already killed him last year.\nSomeone in the Mountain, however, had provided Mudt Jin with jade, shine, and the information\nthat had enabled him to run his criminal enterprise in No Peak territory. Before he’d died, Mudt had\ngiven up a description of an unnamed Green Bone. It might have been any one of several men who’d\nanswered to Gont Asch, none of whom Tar could get to easily now, but given Hilo-jen’s renewed\ninsistence, he picked up the trail once more. Hilo had assigned him two more men, so he had four\nFingers who reported to him directly, and through his brother, he could call upon No Peak’s wider\nnetwork of spies as well. All of these he brought to bear on his goal.\nInitially, Tar had been skeptical about being removed from the Horn’s side of the clan, but now\nhe was pleased with his arrangement. Some of his work as Pillarman was routine and administrative,\nbut the rest was sensitive and vital to the clan. Tar was glad he did not have his brother’s job,\nmanaging hundreds of clan members and never filling Hilo-jen’s shoes. This role suited him much\nbetter. He didn’t have to deal with the layers of clan hierarchy or handle interactions with Lantern\nMen or the public; he answered only to the Pillar, who trusted him implicitly.\nIt was no small task, to ambush an enemy Green Bone in his own territory—and to take him\nalive, no less. Tar planned the operation down to the smallest detail. His target was a junior Fist in the\nMountain named Seko, who had an elderly mother who lived in the Commons district. A fake phone\ncall was placed to Seko early on a Fourthday morning, informing him that his mother had collapsed\non the sidewalk on her way to the grocer’s and been taken to Janloon General Hospital in the Temple\nDistrict. Seko rushed off at once."

Seko rushed off at once.\nAt an intersection on the road between Little Hammer and the Armpit, he was met by an erected\nconstruction barricade. Two cars drove up behind his, blocking his escape. Had the man been any less\ndistracted with worry, he might have Perceived the ambushers’ approach; as it was, he was entirely\ntaken by surprise. Gunmen in the first car peppered his tires with bullets and blew out his rear\nwindshield. Seko burst from the car with an enraged shout, running for the barricade and vaulting\nLight to clear it, but Tar had anticipated this and had in place two of No Peak’s Green Bones who\nwere most skilled in Deflection. They hurled a combined wave that slammed into Seko in midair and\nknocked him to the asphalt like a flung doll. The Fist lay stunned, his energy spent in Steeling himself\nagainst the impact. He hadn’t had the chance to pull his gun from the glove compartment of his car,\nnor did he have a moon blade on him—only his jade-hilted talon knife. Before he could draw it, Tar’s\nmen pinned him with Strength and tore his weapon away. They bound him hand and foot, gagged\nhim, and threw him into the trunk of one of the cars.\nTar was pleased by how smoothly everything had gone. Seizing the man had taken less than five\nminutes. Kehn’s patrols had ensured that the avenue had been cleared, so no property had been\ndamaged and no civilians harmed beyond the minor inconvenience of the road closure. Janlooners\nwere used to occasional incidents of clan violence, but the intense street war last year had sapped\ntheir patience to its limit; the Pillar would not want unnecessary disruption to cost No Peak any more\npublic goodwill.\nTar was tempted to stop by a pay phone to call Hilo-jen with the good news but decided that\nwould be premature. He’d wait until he had substantive information to share. Besides, he needed to\nbeat morning rush-hour traffic before it began in earnest; already the streets were filling with bicycle\ncouriers and delivery trucks. Taking smaller roads, he drove deep into the Junko district. He could\nhear muffled thumps and bangs from the back of the car, but he wasn’t worried. The trunk had been\nthoroughly reinforced with enough steel that even the Strength of a man with twice as much jade as\nSeko would’ve only succeeded in denting it. Sure enough, the noises ceased after a short time,\nleaving only the Perception of the man’s panicked heartbeat and the shrill texture of desperation\nemanating from the compartment.\nThey took their prisoner to an old nightclub that had originally been built as an air-raid shelter\nfifty years ago but had stood empty for the past several months; it was scheduled to be demolished\nand replaced with a condo building. Seko’s wrists were bound with chains and attached to a rope tied\nto a ceiling support beam. He hung with his arms pulled over his head, the toes of his combat boots\nbarely resting on the floor. Tar studied the man. Seko wore dark clothes, jade bolts through his ears,\nand a jade ring in his nose. He had a short, neatly trimmed goatee and an arrogant face; even in his\ndire situation, his lips twisted in a humorless smirk."

Tar motioned for his men to stand by the door, then broke the two smallest\nribs on both sides of Seko’s body. “If you’ve heard of me, then you know that’s just an introduction.”\n“Where’s my ma?” Seko wheezed, in quite a different voice. “Is she all right?”\n“Of course,” said Tar. “She’s probably getting back from the grocer’s now. What do you think\nwe are, animals? In the No Peak clan, we don’t break aisho. We don’t use jadeless people as our\npuppets and tools.” He spat at Seko’s feet. “You were good about never using your name and\ncovering your tracks in No Peak territory, so it took me a while to catch up to you. I’ve found most of\nyour little rats by now, but you’re going to help me find the rest.”\n“You’re going to kill me no matter what I tell you,” Seko pointed out.\nTar shrugged. “Sure, but wouldn’t you rather die quickly and spare your ma from suffering? You\ndon’t want to hang there for days, going through jade withdrawal on top of everything. I’d rather not\nsee it myself. You’re not one of those shine addicts you kept on your leash; you’re a Green Bone of\nthe Mountain—you’ve got some self-respect, don’t you?”\nSeko’s head hung between his straining shoulder blades. He nodded.\n“Good, now we understand each other, you fucking pussy.” Tar rolled the man’s jade in the palm\nof his hand. “Here’s the thing, see: The Mountain’s never answered for Kaul Lan. Someone gave two\nassassins information about his habits, handed them Fullerton machine guns, and sent them to the\nLilac Divine. I’ve done a lot of asking around, and I’m figuring that was you.”\nAfter a moment, Seko nodded again without raising his head. Tar contained the excitement he\nfelt and said, “They worked for your mole Mudt Jin, didn’t they?”\n“They were a couple of punks who held up trailer trucks of fancy handbags and wallets and\nshit,” Seko said. “Just two jade-fevered kids. We didn’t figure them for anything.”\n“What were their names?”\n“How the fuck should I know?” said Seko. “I don’t remember their names.”\nThat was not the answer that Tar wanted to hear. He had a bad feeling that Seko was telling the\ntruth, but he broke another two of the man’s ribs and said, “You’d better give me more than that, you\ngoatfucking bastard. Or I’m going to change my mind about letting you meet the gods in one piece.”\nSeko hung limp, breathing shallowly through a slack mouth, twisting slightly on the rope. Tar left him\nand went outside to give the man some time alone in the dark to search his memory. Sometimes\npeople remembered more after a good long ponder."

        "text": "and went outside to give the man some time alone in the dark to search his memory. Sometimes\npeople remembered more after a good long ponder.\nOutside, because he hadn’t had breakfast yet, he walked down the street to the bakery on the\ncorner and bought a bag of round walnut paste cakes and a carton of sweetened milk. Junko was\nprimarily an industrial district, full of brick and gray concrete, not very attractive, but No Peak was\nstrong here; the businesses had white lanterns hanging over their doors or in their windows, and\npeople on the street dipped in salute when they saw the jade around Tar’s fingers and neck. Tar\nreturned to the building and shared the food with Doun and Tyin, two of his Fingers. Traditionally, the\nPillarman was an administrative role in the clan and did not command Fists or Fingers, but in a time\nof war Kaul Hilo had made certain changes to the position. He’d given Tar and his men responsibility\nfor finding and eliminating enemy agents in No Peak territory, and now he called upon the small team\nfor whatever special tasks he needed accomplished that would otherwise be an additional burden on\nthe Horn. To minimize confusion with Kehn’s organization, Tar was going to suggest to the Pillar that\nhis people be called something other than Fingers, but he was not sure what yet.\nHe was tipping the last of the cake crumbs into his palm when his Perception startled with the\nsudden awareness of something harsh and wrong. Tar tensed, alarmed, scanning in every direction\nuntil he realized that what he was sensing was coming from inside the building: a stampeding\nheartbeat, blinding pain, a blast of terror and triumph. Tar threw open the metal door and was\nastonished to see Seko jerking and sputtering, blood pouring from his neck down the front of his\nblack shirt. Tar drew his talon knife and cut the rope holding the Fist up; the man collapsed like a\nsack, his mouth working instinctively for air, but his eyes bright with scorn. Tar bent over him,\nspitting curses. He could sense the prisoner’s life flooding out like tidewater. He tried to stop it by\ndirecting his own energy into clotting the man’s wound, but Channeling had never been Tar’s\nstrongest discipline, and in seconds, Seko was dead. His bloodstained hands, still bound in chains,\nclutched a small, flat blade.\nToo late, Tar understood his mistake. He’d stripped the man of his talon knife and his jade and\nthought him helpless. In a determined feat of strength and willpower, the Mountain Fist had managed\nto bring his feet up to his hands and extract the plain blade hidden in one of his combat boots. Then\nhe’d pulled his body up on the chains and cut his own throat.\nTar kicked and stomped on the corpse in a blistering fury. When he calmed down, he could not\ndeny he was impressed. For a warrior who’d lost his jade to still outwit his enemies and die on his\nown terms—Seko’s mother ought to be proud to have a son who was so green.\nThat did not change the fact that Tar was now, to his great embarrassment and frustration, at a\ndead end in terms of finding the remaining assassin and the missing jade.\nAs usual, Kehn was more stoic and levelheaded about the situation. “We just have to wait until"

No one with that much jade stays hidden for long.”\nHis brother’s common sense made Tar feel better, but only temporarily; the following week, the\nMountain stole across the border from Spearpoint and took revenge for Seko in an attack that left one\nof Kehn’s men dead and put Tyin in the hospital for two weeks. Because a storefront was damaged by\ngunfire and two civilian bystanders injured by wide Deflections, the incident ended up as front-page\nnews. The headline, No End in Sight to Clan Violence, was printed above the photograph of the dead\nNo Peak Green Bone in a pool of blood in front of the shattered window of a Jollo Plus Mart.\nCHAPTER\n5\nEvery Advantage\nT\nhere must be some misunderstanding, Kaul-jen,” said Mr. Enke. The stocky, gray-haired Lantern\nMan wore a disgruntled frown, and though he was careful to keep his voice respectful, the glower he\nfixed on Shae from under his bushy eyebrows was indignant. “My company has been the leading\ncommercial real estate developer in Janloon for over a decade. I’ve been a Lantern Man of No Peak\nfor twenty-five years and my family has always paid clan tribute. Two of my sons are Green Bones;\none is a Fist who followed your brother when he was Horn and now answers directly to Maik Kehn.\nHow could this contract go to a smaller firm, one that has barely any history with the clan and is not\neven fully Kekonese?”\n“The other company’s bid promised earlier completion at a lower cost,” Shae said from across\nher desk. “The clan values the loyalty and friendship of our long-standing Lantern Men, but the\ncontract was awarded on the basis of merit.”\nMr. Enke made a sputtering sound of disbelief. Slightly behind and to her left and right, Shae\ncould sense Hami Tumashon and Woon Papidonwa shifting uncomfortably at her words. “I’m not\nsure how you define merit, Kaul-jen,” said Mr. Enke in a temper now, “but I ask: What is the purpose\nof the clan if it does not look out for the interests of its most loyal members? Can the friendship of the\nNo Peak clan be so easily broken by unreliable numbers on a piece of paper? Are we not Kekonese\nanymore, but Espenians, selling ourselves to the lowest bidder?”\n“With the Weather Man’s permission,” said Hami, speaking out of turn but clearly intent on\nreining in the situation, “perhaps we can reach an accommodation.” Shae’s lips tightened, but she\nnodded, and Hami went on. “Mr. Enke, the clan has to look out for the interests of the country as well\nas its Lantern Men; we can all agree on that point. Smaller firms should be given a chance to succeed,\nand foreign investment is good for the national economy. That isn’t to say that No Peak values you\nand your family’s allegiance any less. In fact, we hope to see your company continue to grow by"

In fact, we hope to see your company continue to grow by\ninvesting in equipment and personnel. If the Weather Man agrees, we would negotiate a reduction in\ntribute payments to support you in this.”\nHami looked to Shae, who inclined her head stiffly. “That seems reasonable.”\nMr. Enke did not look entirely satisfied by this concession, but after a few moments of silent\nconsideration, he grumbled, “Very well. I’ve trusted in the clan of the Torch—let the gods recognize\nhim—for too long to let this one unfortunate experience get between us.” The way he eyed Shae\nmade it clear that he did not trust her in the same way. “We’ll take advantage of the lower tribute\nyou’ve extended and do our best to put together a more convincing bid next time.”\nAfter Woon closed the door behind the departed Lantern Man, Shae turned to Hami and said,\n“Why did you speak without my prompting? You offered him too much prematurely.”\n“You appointed me as Master Luckbringer to speak my mind,” said Hami gruffly as he stood and\nwalked to the door. “So I’m speaking my mind now: You mishandled the situation. The Enke family\nis an old and influential one in the clan. Even if you had good reasons for your decisions, you made\nthem feel disrespected.” He paused and spoke over his shoulder. “Right now, Kaul-jen, you need the\nsupport of the Lantern Men more than a hundred million dien of cost savings.” Hami pushed through\nthe door of Shae’s office, letting in a brief wave of noise—ringing telephones and clacking typewriter\nkeys from the cubicles across the hall—before the door closed firmly and the man’s proud jade aura\nreceded down the hallway.\nShae slumped back in her seat. Hami was right; her defensive response to Enke and cold talk of\nmerit had struck the wrong note and forced the Master Luckbringer to step in and offer a solution\nbefore she did. She’d come across as a naive young woman, overly influenced by her foreign\neducation, not a properly experienced Weather Man of a Green Bone clan. Finances she understood,\nstrategy and politics she was learning, but clan leadership required managing not only the vast scope\nof No Peak’s business concerns but the seemingly irreconcilable interests and expectations of its\npeople. “What was I supposed to do?” Shae demanded aloud, hearing the exasperation in her own\nvoice.\nWoon didn’t react to her change in tone; they’d worked together closely for too many long, late\nhours over the past year for her to maintain the same professional demeanor with him as she did with\nHami or anyone else in the office tower on Ship Street. The Weather Man’s Shadow looked down at\nhis folded hands, then cleared his throat. “I can only say what I think Lan-jen would’ve done. He\nwould’ve called Mr. Enke into his office and, out of consideration for his status in the clan, given him\na chance to match the lower bid. If the Lantern Man couldn’t do so, then he would explain that\nregretfully he had to give the contract to the other developer, but he’d ask what the clan could offer to\nhelp his business become more competitive.”"

        "text": "regretfully he had to give the contract to the other developer, but he’d ask what the clan could offer to\nhelp his business become more competitive.”\nShae stared gloomily out the rain-splattered windows. She’d spent the past six weeks grieving\nher grandfather and almost, for a short while, forgotten how much she missed Lan.\nWoon leaned forward in his seat, elbows on knees. “The clan is a big, old ship—powerful but\ndifficult to steer, Shae-jen. I know you want to make changes and improvements, but you should do\nso carefully. In times of uncertainty, people look for reassurance that they can count on things being\ndone in the way they’ve come to expect. They’ll talk about how you wronged the Enke family.\nThey’re still talking about how you wronged Kowi Don.”\n“I won’t run the office on cronyism the way Doru did,” Shae replied, with some heat. “Kowi\nDon wasn’t qualified to be hired as a Luckbringer just because he’s the son of a councilman.”\nWoon inclined his chin. “You’re sitting in that chair because you’re a Kaul.”\nHe said it simply, with no rancor at all, but Shae winced at the truth. She was well aware that she\nstill had a long way to go to prove herself on Ship Street. The clan had barely escaped destruction last\nyear, and even though the street war had settled into something of a stalemate, the Mountain was\nlarger and remained in a stronger financial position. No Peak was dominant in some sectors, such as\nreal estate and construction, but the boom in housing and infrastructure development that had\noccurred in the decades after the Many Nations War had slowed; meanwhile, several of the industries\nwhere the Mountain held a greater share, such as manufacturing, retail, and transportation, continued\ntheir healthy growth. No Peak had to expand operations more aggressively if it hoped to prevail in the\nlong run, and every action Shae took as Weather Man might improve or worsen the clan’s position\nrelative to its enemies. Her voice and shoulders fell. “We need every advantage we can get, no matter\nhow slight,” she insisted. “That’s driving all my decisions, even if some of them upset people.”\n“Trust is also an advantage,” Woon said.\n“You don’t believe the clan trusts me?”\n“You’re extremely hardworking and smart, Shae-jen, anyone can see that,” Woon said, with\nsurprising vehemence for someone normally so soft-spoken. “And you’re a Kaul. So the clan trusts\nyou on those levels. But Lantern Men are loyal to the clan because of what it can do for them, and\nlately, you’ve been shutting doors instead of opening them.”\nShae sat silently for long moment. Thick clouds laden with spring rain hung over Janloon; from\na distance the sky and the sea were the same indistinguishable shade of flat gray-blue. “I’m grateful I\nhave you, Papi-jen.” She meant it. If Lan had not been killed, Woon would’ve been the one sitting in\nthis office as Weather Man, yet he’d devoted himself tirelessly to being the Weather Man’s Shadow,\nher chief of staff, never expressing bitterness or complaint.

Woon was not unusually cunning or\nclever, he did not have a forceful personality, but like Lan, he seemed made of such a steadfast and\ndependable fiber that Shae understood why he’d been her brother’s longtime friend and aide. She put\na hand on his arm. “It’s been a long day. Go home; no need to wait for me.”\nWoon stood, dislodging her hand from his arm, and she Perceived his jade aura pulse with some\nsudden, stifled emotion. “I have work to do as well,” he said. “Take the time you need, Kaul-jen; I’ll\ndrive you home as usual afterward.” The former Pillarman had left Lan alone on the evening of his\nmurder. He had not gone home early in all his time as her Shadow.\nWhen Woon had gone, Shae went through paperwork at her desk for another couple of hours.\nHer reflection emerged in the darkening windowpanes as the lights of downtown Janloon came on,\ntransforming the skyscrapers into luminous columns. The phone rang, and she picked up the receiver.\n“Kaul-jen,” said the slightly nasal voice of Ree Turahuo on the other end, “I’m glad I caught you still\nat the office. I was hoping we might have a frank discussion between Weather Men.”\nShae put down the report she’d been reading; the phone cord stretched as she pushed her chair\nback from the table. “Ree-jen,” she said, her voice calm and dispassionate. “What would you like to\ndiscuss?”\n“Next month, the board of the Kekon Jade Alliance is scheduled to finally reconvene and hold a\nshareholder vote on whether to recommence national jade mining operations,” Ree said. “How do No\nPeak and its allies among the minor clans intend to vote?”\nShae said, “The Pillar is considering all the factors. He hasn’t yet made a decision.”\n“Come now, Kaul-jen,” said Ree, his voice sharpening, “don’t play games. We all know that\nyour brother leans on your counsel in all these matters. You’re the one making the decision. Do you\nplan to prolong this needless suspension, or return the country to normal?”\n“The mines can begin operations again once all possible measures have been taken to prevent\nanother abuse of power on the part of the Mountain clan,” Shae said. “I haven’t fully determined to\nmy satisfaction if the Royal Council’s reforms are sufficient.” She smiled to herself, wishing she\ncould see or Perceive the other Weather Man’s reaction. A national scandal had resulted when\nfinancial discrepancies she’d discovered in the KJA’s records nearly two years ago had revealed that\nthe Mountain had been secretly taking jade above quota behind the backs of the government and the\nother Green Bone clans. Ayt publicly maintained that negligence and operational issues were to\nblame, but few people believed that line, even within her own clan. The Royal Council had passed\nlegislation instituting ownership restrictions to prevent the Kekon Jade Alliance from falling under\nsingle clan control, mandated annual independent audits, formed an oversight committee, and taken a\nnumber of other measures intended to safeguard the country’s jade supply and ensure its transparent\nmanagement.

Meanwhile, for the past eighteen months, the mines of Kekon had sat idle. No new jade\nflowed into the national coffers; official exports had stopped; thousands of Abukei mine workers had\ngone on government assistance.\nRee said tightly, “If the vote does not go through, the matter will go back to the Royal Council\nfor gods-only-know how long. We’ll lose out on the upcoming dry season and this terrible disruption\nto the country’s economy will last another year. Is that what you want?”\n“I want the Mountain to be held accountable for its transgressions.” The longer the mining\nsuspension lasted, the longer the public would be reminded of the Mountain’s crimes.\nA pause. Ree’s voice changed, took on a shrewd quality. “You will eventually run out of jade to\nsell to the Espenians. How much can you really afford to empty No Peak’s stores?” In the momentary\nsilence that followed, Shae could picture Ree’s smug expression. “Yes, of course we know you’ve\nbeen selling your own reserves, and that’s why the foreigners haven’t yet made a bigger stink. I\nimagine the Royal Council and the people of Kekon would be interested to know that No Peak is\nbolstering its finances by selling jade directly to the Republic of Espenia.”\n“I imagine our official allies the Espenians would be interested to know about the Mountain’s\nsecret contracts to sell jade to their enemies, the Ygutanians,” Shae replied coolly. “Especially if\nEspenian soldiers are deployed to fight in Shotar against rebels who’re trained and supported by\nYgutan. They’re hardly going to be pleased to see Kekonese jade worn by soldiers on the other side\nof the battlefield.”\n“This is pointless sparring, Kaul-jen,” Ree snapped. “You may believe that it is to No Peak’s\nadvantage to continue dragging out the KJA scandal, but consider our mutual dilemma. The\nconstriction on the jade supply has done nothing but encourage smugglers and raise the rate of violent\ncrime. The people have had enough of bloodshed and economic disruption; they’re worried that the\ncrisis in Oortoko will turn into a war between foreign powers and spread through the region. They\nexpect Green Bones to defend Kekon if that happens—do you think they feel confident we’re doing\nthat, Kaul-jen?”\nShae did not answer.\n“We’re not Fists, you and I, who see the world only in black and red,” Ree said. “Neither is my\nPillar, though I certainly can’t speak for yours.

He no longer had to sleep on the\nfloor of his aunt’s apartment; he had his own place now, on the third floor of a ten-story tenement\nhouse in the Forge. It wasn’t much to look at; his door sagged, the plumbing was old, and the walls\nwere thin.

None of that\nmattered. When Bero woke up each day around noon, he went into the bathroom and gazed into the\nmirror at the jade hanging around his neck. With his shoulders squared and his head cocked, he turned\nthis way and that, examining his reflection from different angles. He picked up a talon knife and held\nit poised. He liked what he saw. Strength. Power. Respect.\nHe tied off his arm with a rubber tourniquet and shot up two doses of SN1 each day, like\nclockwork, marking them off on a wall calendar. He’d been told by Mudt—not the boy Mudt Kal, but\nhis father, Mudt Jin, now dead—that missing an injection or taking an extra one could mean a fatal\noverdose. When the shine hit his brain, Bero felt invincible. Some good things did come from\nforeigners, and shine was one of them. Why spend an entire childhood training at some draconian\nmartial school when there were modern methods? The jade energy humming through Bero’s veins\nwas hot and sharp, better than anything else in the world, better than money or sex. The taste he’d\nexperienced two years ago, when he’d gotten his hands on jade for a mere few minutes—that had\nbeen nothing. His whole life prior to now had been a dull, colorless, half-conscious dream from\nwhich he’d finally awoken. When he walked down the street, he felt as if he glided like a tiger\nthrough a herd of cattle.\nIn the evenings, he went to an underground training club in Coinwash called the Rat House. It\nwas one of a few hideouts in the city where people with unsanctioned jade congregated to self-train,\ninject SN1 safely, and show off the green that they could never display in public. Usually, Bero would\nfind Mudt there as well, and the two of them would practice Strength on the concrete blocks or\nrunning with Lightness against the brick wall. Their abilities were inconsistent; Bero might leap a\nstraight meter on one day but jump barely higher than normal the next. This frustrated but didn’t\ndiscourage him. He hadn’t expected to be good right away. It was a matter of more jade and more\npractice before he’d be able to rival Green Bones.\nAfter a couple of hours, Bero would have a drink at the bar, then start to work the dimly lit\nseating area, selling shine. He had regular customers who bought from him every week, and he made\ngood money so he didn’t have to keep any other sort of employment, unlike Mudt, who’d moved in\nwith some distant relatives and lied about his age to get a job as a stocker in a shoe store. Most of the\npeople in the Rat House were men in their early to mid twenties from the low-income parts of inner\nnortheast Janloon—the Docks, the Forge, Coinwash, and Fishtown. Some sported gang tattoos.\nOthers, Bero suspected, were on the wrong side of the law for other reasons besides illegal jade\nownership. And a few appeared to be otherwise respectable individuals with day jobs, who for some\nreason were willing to risk their lives to be green. No one in the Rat House was formally trained, and"

No one in the Rat House was formally trained, and\nmany were not trained at all; they needed SN1 on a daily basis to maintain the jade tolerance that\nGreen Bones developed after years of effort. It made for a reliable client base.\nBero’s untrained sense of Perception seemed to work intermittently. It did not extend very far,\nbut he could usually tell when others in the same room were wearing jade because they seemed to\nglow in his mind differently. Every once in a while, he would look at someone and pick up flashes of\nemotion or intent. It didn’t take much skill in Perception, however, for him to sense the borderline\nhostile curiosity directed at him as he went around the club. When he was out in the city, Bero kept\nhis jade hidden under the turned-up collar of his shirt or jacket and stayed as far away as he could\nfrom Green Bones who might notice him and ask questions, but here in the Rat House, people saw the\namount of jade he wore. They wanted to know how a teenage boy had gotten his hands on so much.\nThey never asked. The cardinal rule in the Rat House was that no one asked where and how\nanother person had obtained their jade. Stolen, scavenged, bought on the black market, it didn’t\nmatter—the one thing everyone here had in common was a death sentence if they were ever caught\nby Green Bones of the major clans, who were, fortunately, still too busy fighting each other to pay\nmuch attention to anyone else. The Rat House was the one place where unsanctioned users could talk\nfreely, test their powers, and boast loudly and drunkenly of overturning those that kept jade in the\nhands of the elite few.\nThey called themselves the new green.\nFor the most part, Bero felt that all was finally right in his world except for the fact that he was\nbound to run out of shine soon. His initially sizable cache was dwindling as he used it up and sold it.\nSo when a man Bero had seen around the Rat House a few times motioned him over one night and\nsaid, “Hey, why don’t you and your friend sit and have a drink with me. I’ve got a business idea for\nyou, one I think you’d like to hear,” Bero called Mudt over and pulled up a chair.\nThe man had a narrow, darkly tanned face, and his hair, with the sides shorn close to the skull\nand the center teased up with hair gel, made it seem even narrower. He appeared Kekonese but might\nhave been of mixed blood, and he spoke with a foreign accent. He was perhaps thirty years old and he\nsaid his name was Soradiyo.\n“What is that, some kind of shottie name?” Bero said.\n“Some kind of shottie name,” Soradiyo agreed, without expression. He gave the boys an\nevaluative stare. “You’re not afraid to be wearing that much jade?”\nBero squinted. The man across from him had a jade aura, that much Bero could tell, but\nSoradiyo wore his green out of sight. Whoever he was, he didn’t want to draw any attention to\nhimself, not even here in the Rat House. “It’s my jade, I’m going to wear it,” Bero declared. “If the"

Everyone’s got to die someday.”\n“We’ve got more jade than some Fists,” Mudt added fiercely, his cheeks flushing. “I don’t care\nhow long it takes, I’m going to train until I can take on any Green Bone.”\nFatalistic bravado was typical among the new green, but lately, words like that were spoken less\noften and in lower voices. Bero had heard that a couple years ago, many frequenters of the Rat House\nhad been informers for the Mountain clan, granted their jade and kept in shine by Green Bones under\nGont Asch who wanted to sow agents inside No Peak territory. Since Gont’s death, the Mountain had\npulled back, and No Peak slaughtered the new green whenever they could find them. The Kauls\noffered amnesty to any of the Mountain’s agents who came forward, surrendered their jade, and\nprovided the names of their accomplices. Many took the offer, figuring it better to lose one’s jade and\nkeep one’s head than be hunted down by Maik Tar and his men.\nSoradiyo raised his glass, giving them a thick-lipped smile that was somehow encouraging and\ncondescending at the same time. “Belief is the first step toward making your dreams come true,” he\nsaid.\nBero snorted with impatience. For some reason, he felt the urge to impress this man, even\nthough he disliked him. “So what do you want to talk to us about?”\nSoradiyo moved his chair out of the way of the drip from an overhead pipe. The Rat House had\nno windows; the ceiling and walls were water stained, and by two or three o’clock in the morning, the\nair was thickly clogged with the stench of sweat and cigarette smoke. “I’m a recruiter,” said Soradiyo.\n“I look for people who have two things: jade, and something wrong with the part of the brain that’s\nsupposed to make them fear death.”\n“Way to sell the job,” Bero said.\nSoradiyo gave a sharp laugh. “I’m asking if you want to be a rockfish.” A jade smuggler—the\nsort that moved gems out of the country. “The pay’s in money and shine, and eventually, in green.\nYou’d make more than you ever could selling shine. A lot more.”\nBero asked, “You work for someone?”\n“I’m a sworn man of Ti Pasuiga. You know what that means?” Soradiyo bared his teeth in a\nsmile at their affirmative silence. The things he had said no longer seemed like exaggeration;\nassociation with the largest, most notorious jade trafficking ring could indeed deliver a daring man to\nfabulous wealth or an undignified death.\nSoradiyo rapped misshapen knuckles idly against the tabletop. “Business is good; there’s more\ndemand than ever and money to go around. But it’s too risky to keep relying on the Abukei.” Jade-\nimmune aboriginals who didn’t give off an aura and didn’t suffer the dramatic and sometimes fatal\neffects of excessive jade exposure were the natural gem mules in the black market jade trade, but they\nwere easy to identify and subject to suspicion at any border exit.

Some of the weathered stone buildings that Shae walked past dated all the way\nback to the unification of the island at the end of the Warring Sisters period. Others, like the Foreign\nStudies Department building, were gleaming modern structures of steel and glass and concrete. Shae\nentered through the double doors and slipped into the back of the lecture hall, taking an empty seat in\nthe last row. The class was already in progress; Maro was writing on the blackboard and did not see\nher come in, but when he turned back around to face the class, his eyes found her and a small smile\ntugged briefly at his mouth before he addressed the students paying attention to him. “Last week, we\ndiscussed the aftermath of the Many Nations War and how the economic and political collapse of the\nTun Empire, followed by decades of civil conflict and reform, allowed Ygutan to fill the power\nvacuum left on the Orius continent. We’ll be shifting our focus for the rest of this term to the postwar\npolicies of the Republic of Espenia with regards to Shotar and Kekon, and how that is directly related\nto current events.”\nShae was interested in the lecture, and Tau Maro was an engaging speaker—organized,\nknowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the material—but Shae could not keep her mind from\nreturning to the prior day’s phone conversation with Ree Tura.

Maro wrote a closing question\non the blackboard. “Your assignment this week is to write three pages on the following topic: How\ndoes the recent ratification of the Pact of Friendship and Mutual Noninterference between Tun and\nYgutan affect Kekon?”\nWhen the students had gathered their belongings and dispersed from the lecture hall, Shae rose\nfrom her seat and walked to the front of the room. “I hope you didn’t mind me coming early to\nwatch,” she said. “You’re a very good teacher.”\nMaro finished erasing the blackboard, then glanced around at the empty seats before leaning in\nto plant a kiss on the corner of Shae’s mouth. His short beard tickled her cheek, and she caught a\nwhiff of aftershave mingled with the scent of the chalk dusting the lapels and shoulders of the brown\nsuede jacket he wore over a white shirt. “I don’t mind at all,” he said. “You look nice. Where are we\ngoing for dinner?”\nSpring rains had washed the campus sidewalks clean and made the wide lawns green and lush.\nStudents on bicycles streamed past them as they left the university grounds. Shae did not have a car\nand driver waiting; she’d taken a taxi straight from the office on Ship Street, pausing only to refresh\nher makeup and exchange her blazer for a sequined red shawl. She began to hail another cab, but\nMaro said, “At this time on a Fifthday, it’ll be faster to take the subway. You don’t mind, do you?”\nShe assured him she did not.\nStanding on the subway platform, talking casually about the lecture, the university campus, and\nthe recent weather, Shae felt some of the tension from her work week slowly unknotting. She rested\nher eyes on Maro, on his reassuringly unhurried demeanor as he allowed the first, overly crowded\ntrain to pass and waited for the next. Maro’s short beard made him look older and more serious than\nhe truly was, but he had a soft mouth and watchful eyes, and large, handsome hands. He was the most\npleasant surprise that had happened to Shae all year. She had not been looking for a relationship.\nSometimes she thought about Jerald with nostalgia and wished for companionship, but she had little\nroom for any sort of social life outside of No Peak responsibilities. With her grandfather’s death and\nfuneral, and recent demands at the Weather Man’s office, she hadn’t seen Maro in over a month. “I’m\nsorry that it’s been so long since we got together,” she said.\nMaro shook his head. “I know things can’t have been easy for you lately. I’ve been thinking\nabout you but didn’t want to intrude, knowing there was already so much public attention on your\nfamily.” He hesitated, then slipped his hand into hers and gave it a squeeze. “I’m glad you’re able to\nget away tonight.”\nThey went to the Golyaani Kitchen, an upscale dining spot in North Sotto, not far from the\napartment where Shae used to live when she’d first moved back to Janloon.

The waiter showed them to a corner booth where Shae ordered a\ncocktail and Maro chose a midrange Shotarian whiskey and a glass of water. “So. How are you doing\nthese days?” he asked her.\n“Better than I was. I miss my grandfather… but he wasn’t really himself in the last year of his\nlife. He used to be such a force of nature.” Shae stirred her cocktail pensively. “I like to think that he’s\nawaiting the Return in the afterlife with my father and my brother, and they’re all much happier and\nmore peaceful now.” She paused to take a long sip of her drink, determined not to be melancholy on\nwhat ought to be a lighthearted evening. She reached across the table and laid her hand over Maro’s\nlarge one; his jade aura was like a light blanket, full of interesting wrinkles and pleasant to touch.\n“How’re things at work?”\n“The usual,” Maro replied, letting her change the subject. “I’m teaching three classes this\nsemester. And I’m still trying to get my foreign studies trips funded. The bureaucracy in academia\nnever ceases to astound me.” A sigh of wry resignation. “With events in Shotar being in the news so\nmuch, I’ve also been called to Wisdom Hall a lot lately.”\nWhen Shae had first met Maro at a Kaul Dushuron Academy alumni event six months ago, she’d\ndetermined immediately that he would be a valuable acquaintance. As Weather Man, she needed to be\ncurrent in her knowledge of international relations and trade. At age thirty-three, Tau Marosun was\none of the youngest faculty members in the Foreign Studies Department at Jan Royal University and a\npolitical advisor to the Royal Council. The fact that the accomplished young professor was attractive\nwas a noteworthy but secondary consideration. She asked Maro to sit down with her over dinner a\nfew weeks later, hoping to build a professional relationship and gather additional names from his\nnetwork of experts in the field. They’d talked for four hours, beginning with his academic areas of\nexpertise but soon ranging into everything from Janloon’s restaurant scene, to foreign films, to budget\ntraveling.\nAfterward, Maro had shyly asked if he might see her again.\nThe Golyaani Kitchen served upscale traditional Tuni food alongside a large and varied drink\nmenu, and on a Fifthday evening, the surrounding tables were occupied by the young professionals\nwho populated the North Sotto district. Hanging pot lamps illuminated the stylish brick hearth, black\ntabletops, and shelves of decorative rustic bottles filled with dried spices. Their meal arrived: smoked\nliver sausage, spiced eggplant stew over rice, quail baked in a clay pot. Shae was pleased when Maro\nexclaimed appreciatively over the dishes and complimented her selections. She watched him ladle the\neggplant stew onto both of their plates. Maro did everything with a certain subtle deliberation:\noutlining the topics of his lecture before the beginning of class, pausing before speaking, taking the\ntime to smell whiskey before drinking it.

        "text": "time to smell whiskey before drinking it. He was completely unlike Jerald. Shae’s previous boyfriend\nhad been athletic and exuberant, vigorous in bed, a funny, charming, ultimately shallow and\ninsensitive young Espenian military officer. Maro was intelligent and opinionated, but unpretentious,\nvaluing thoughtful conversation and new experiences. He was also unlike most Green Bone men Shae\nwas accustomed to; he wore two jade studs pierced conservatively through his left ear, but he had\nnever been a Finger in the clan. Indeed, he seemed to have little interest in clan affairs, asking after\nthem only insofar as they were important to Shae and to the extent that they related to national\npolitics and world issues.\n“What’s the Royal Council been asking you?” Shae asked.\n“Exactly the sort of thing I ask my students,” Maro said, a touch ironically. “But in far greater\ndetail than a three-page report.” Shae recalled the question he’d written on the blackboard at the end\nof class: How does the recent ratification of the Pact of Friendship and Mutual Noninterference\nbetween Tun and Ygutan affect Kekon?\n“So how would you answer your own essay question?” she asked him.\nMaro took a bite of quail, chewing and swallowing before replying. “I would say that Kekon is\ngoing to be in an unprecedentedly difficult position. The Tun-Ygutan pact isn’t surprising. Tun has\ntoo many of its own problems to oppose Ygutan, and the Ygutanians are content to leave their largest\nborder undisturbed so they can concentrate on attaining control of the entire Origas Gulf. That’s\nentirely unacceptable to Shotar and to Espenia. The ROE is bound to commit more military resources\nto the region, and to Kekon in particular.”\nShae nodded. “We’ll be caught between the Espenosphere and the Ygut Coalition.” Kekon was\nofficially allied with the Republic of Espenia and hosted the largest Espenian naval base in the region\non Euman Island. The Kekonese, however, generally did not care for the Espenians more than any\nother foreigners. They were geographically closer to the continent of Orius than that of Spenius, and\nthey had such a long enmity with Shotar that it was hard to imagine the two countries being on the\nsame side simply because they both had alliances with the ROE. Shae’s mind returned to the vexing\nconversation she’d had with Ree Tura. The world outside of Kekon was exerting forces that derailed\neven a blood feud between the Green Bone clans.\n“It’s a politically charged situation,” Maro agreed, “but maybe an opportunity as well, for our\ncountry to play a bigger role on the world stage.” He took a sip of his drink; when he set the glass\ndown, he said, “For most of our history, we’ve been an insular, tribal, and isolationist island, trusting\nin jade and Green Bones to keep us safe. But all that’s been changing. Jade brought the world to our\ndoorstep, and now we have to take part in that world.”\nShae thought about her cousin, now in Espenia. She’d been certain she was doing the right thing,\nconvincing Hilo to send Anden to study abroad. No Peak was in need of more people who had lived"

No Peak was in need of more people who had lived\nand worked outside of Kekon, who understood the rapidly changing world that Maro spoke of. Anden\nhad not believed her, though, had blamed her, even. Shae paused in her meal and settled her gaze on\nMaro. “I can’t help but wonder,” she said with a smile, “how someone ends up as a leading professor\nof foreign studies after graduating from a hidebound Green Bone clan institution like Kaul Du\nAcademy.”\nMaro grimaced as he leaned in. “I almost didn’t,” he admitted. “Graduate, that is. I struggled\nwith the jade disciplines and wanted to drop out as a year-five, but that wasn’t an option. I’m the only\nboy in my family.” It was an enduring belief among Kekonese that every family of quality had jade in\nit. An only son would be expected to receive a martial education and wear green. Maro pursed his lips\nthoughtfully, then finished the whiskey in his glass. “Looking back now, I’m glad I went through the\ntraining. I think I’m a stronger person because of it. But at the time, it was hard. Fortunately, my\nacademic grades pulled me through, but I was never really cut out to be a Green Bone. Not like\ncertain people who graduate Rank One.” He gave Shae a teasing prod with his elbow. “I remember\nyou from back then. I was a year-four when you came in as a year-one. You don’t remember me, do\nyou?”\nShae was embarrassed to admit that she did not. “That’s okay, I wouldn’t expect you to,” Maro\nsaid. “I was a bookworm and didn’t make much of an impression at the time. Everyone knew who\nyou were, though. You and your brother being in the same class, it was hard to miss you.”\n“I’m mortified by the idea that you remember me as a ten-year-old.”\nMaro laughed—a surprisingly rich, pleasant sound. “I’m relieved you don’t remember me as an\nawkward teenager at the bottom of the Academy pecking order, or there’s no chance you would be\nhaving dinner with me now. I know we haven’t known each other all that long, but… I think you’re\nwonderful.” Color rose in Maro’s face and he briefly turned his attention to straightening his napkin.\n“You’re beautiful and intelligent, forward-thinking, and open-minded. I think it’s a great thing that\nyou’ve become the Weather Man of No Peak. Anyone like me can talk about change, but you can\nactually make it happen.”\nShae did not know how to respond. Maro’s words put a flush of warmth in her chest, but she was\nnot sure she deserved his unreserved confidence. The clans were still at war, the KJA suspended,\nsmuggling was on the rise. The Oortokon crisis was drawing in Espenia and Ygutan, and as Maro\nhimself had said, Kekon was bound to be affected by any regional conflict between the major powers.\nShe felt unprepared to handle so many threats to the clan and the country, and already her decisions"

The clan is a big, old ship that’s hard to steer.” Shae\nheard herself repeating Woon’s words to her from yesterday. “Even as Weather Man, I’m not sure if I\ncan make enough of a difference.”\nMaro tilted his chin down, eyebrows raised in a skeptical expression that Shae imagined he used\non students who provided a poor explanation for turning in their term papers late. “Your grandfather\n—let the gods recognize him—helped the country to open up and become prosperous after the Many\nNations War. The Green Bone clans might be the most traditional Kekonese cultural institutions, but\nprogress has come out of them before.” He took both of Shae’s hands in his own and gazed at her\nwith an utmost seriousness that made it hard for her to meet his eyes without her face growing hot.\n“You were the youngest in your class at the Academy, but you beat out everyone else in the rankings,\neven your own older brother. I’ve heard people say that you lead the clan as much as he does now.\nYou were born and trained for your role. Who could possibly make a difference, if not you?” When\nhe had strong opinions about a subject, Maro was an undeniably convincing rhetorician, and despite\nher recent bouts of self-doubt, Shae could not help but smile and wish to believe everything he said.\nAs the waiter cleared their finished dishes, the Lantern Man chef and owner of the Golyaani\nKitchen came out of the kitchen and over to their table to pay her respects. She was a short, round-\nfaced Tuni woman who must’ve been born or raised in Janloon because she spoke Kekonese\nflawlessly. “Kaul-jen,” she said, touching clasped hands to her forehead and saluting deeply, “it’s an\nhonor for my humble establishment to serve you. Was the food to your taste tonight?” Shae assured\nher that it had been a superb meal. Maro took out his wallet to pay the bill and was promptly\nadmonished, “No, no, there’s no charge; you’re a guest of the Weather Man and we’re a loyal No\nPeak business.”\nShae rose to leave, but Maro remained seated. “I insist on paying,” he said, looking not at the\nowner but at Shae. “I’m not part of the clan so the restaurant doesn’t owe me anything, and even\nthough I know you could eat at any number of places without charge any night of the week, I would\nlike to buy you dinner. It’s a small thing, but please let me pay for the meal.”\nThe restaurateur looked questioningly at Shae, who hesitated. If she accepted the gallant, if\nawkward gesture, she would’ve visited the Golyaani Kitchen not as the Weather Man of No Peak\npatronizing a clan business with a guest, but as Maro’s companion. Already, she could imagine the\nrumors and questions that would begin to travel through the more gossipy circles of the clan.\nThere was something so artlessly charming about Maro’s request, however, a genuine earnest"

She nodded to the Lantern\nMan owner of the Golyaani Kitchen and smiled at her date, sitting back down to let him settle the bill.\n“Thank you, Maro.”\nOutside, the concrete was damp with the typical drizzly Northern Sweat of monsoon season, but\nthe moisture had cleared away the smog and Janloon smelled uncommonly fresh. They walked arm in\narm down the sidewalk, talking, Shae nostalgically pointing out small things about her old\nneighborhood: the bookstore with the parrot in the window, the food stall that sold paper cones of\nsweet roasted nuts, the new neon theater signs that had appeared since she’d moved away. They\nstopped outside the window of a record shop, and Shae was impressed to see a selection of vinyl\nsoundtracks from Espenian film musicals, several of which she’d watched during her time as a\nstudent in Windton. She’d developed a fondness for them; they were always full of costumes and\nlaughable melodrama.\nMaro put an arm around her waist. She liked the feel of it, the soft pressure against her hips.\n“Have I mentioned that you’re not what I expected?” he said.\n“What do you mean?” Shae leaned into his side. Letting Maro pay for dinner had stripped her\nguard; she felt warm from drink and food and company. It had been a long time since she’d enjoyed\nsuch a leisurely evening and been so pleasantly distracted from clan war and business.\n“When people hear the name Kaul, they think war hero, or jade prodigy, or heir to the great\nGreen Bone clan dynasty,” Maro said. “Not shameless fan of silly romantic musicals.”\n“There’s nothing wrong with silly romantic musicals,” Shae protested.\n“Of course not,” Maro said with mock seriousness. “I’m not going to argue such an important\nissue with you. Not when you could kill me with your little finger.”\n“Now why would I do that and ruin a perfectly nice evening?” she teased.\nMaro’s smile faded and his expression turned hesitant. Their banter had been meant in good\nhumor, but had nevertheless highlighted the one inescapable disparity between them. As they\ncontinued walking down the street, Maro fell silent for an uncomfortable minute. “Can I tell you a\nsecret?” he asked. When Shae nodded, he confessed, “I’ve never been in a duel. I was challenged\nonce, over some stupid drunken argument, but managed to delay it and not show up the next day.\nThat’s why I have no more and no less green than I graduated with from the Academy.” Maro paused\non the sidewalk and turned toward her, his face shadowed under the streetlight, his expression\nuncertain. “I don’t think of myself as a coward, but… I’m not a clan loyalist, and winning jade has\nnever been important to me.”\nIf either of Shae’s brothers had ever run from a fair duel, their grandfather would’ve whipped\nthem for the disgrace.

Of course, that had never been necessary; Hilo was more likely to be beaten for\ncausing too many needless duels than anything else. In most other parts in the world, dueling (if two\nmen firing pistols at each other from across a field could even be calling dueling) had gone out of\nfashion or been made illegal long ago, but in Kekon, winning contests was still the most prestigious\nway of earning jade, and jade was inextricably tied to social status. Dueling was simply expected of a\nGreen Bone man and was a common way of settling disputes even among non–Green Bones.\n“I never expected I’d fall for a woman as green as you, a Kaul no less. I think at least half the\nmotivation for men to wear jade is to impress women, and it’s obvious I don’t have a chance in that\nregard.” Maro gave a soft, self-deprecating laugh. He took a step closer, narrowing the space between\nthem, and lowered his face. “But I have. Fallen for you. Even though I realize I might not be the sort\nof person who’s acceptable to your family.”\nShae pictured what Hilo’s reaction would be to hearing a Green Bone confess that he’d never\nfought to earn or defend his jade—skepticism, astonishment, disdain—and she was seized by an\nabrupt surge of proud and protective affection for Maro. “I think it’s the opposite of cowardice to be\ntrue to who you are,” she said. She leaned forward and kissed him.\nThe heat of their mouths collided. Shae shivered as she felt Maro’s jade aura ripple with pleasant\nsurprise and then hum with sparking lust. Answering desire rose and tugged at Shae’s navel,\nshockingly strong and insistent. It had been a long time since she’d taken a man to bed—not since\nshe’d split with Jerald and returned to Kekon two years ago. She clutched the lapels of Maro’s jacket\nand rose onto the balls of her feet, kissing him harder, more insistently. Maro wrapped a hand around\nthe back of her head, his fingers tangling in her hair, and curled the other arm around her waist,\ntugging her body closer to his own. Arousal lit between them.\nShae pulled away with a sucking gasp, suddenly struck by the worry that they would be seen.\nHere in No Peak territory, the clan’s Fingers and informers were always nearby; word might reach\nHilo by midnight that the Weather Man had been seen kissing a strange man on the street corner. “A\ntaxi,” she whispered urgently, and stepped to the curb to hail the nearest one.\nIn the back seat of the cab, she draped her legs over his, and Maro bent his head down to hers;\nhis mouth moved eagerly over her jaw and ear. “Do you want to go to your place?” The Weather\nMan’s house was still under renovation, and Shae didn’t want to bring Maro into the main house,\nwhere she might have to introduce him to her brother. “No,” she said, sliding her hands under his\njacket, feeling the heat and musculature of his back. “Let’s go to yours.”"

The cab let them off in front of the building, and they ran up the stairs\nholding on to each other. On the landing, they fell to kissing once again. Maro tried twice to fit his\noffice key into his apartment door before he cursed and laughed and finally succeeded in letting them\nin. The inside of the apartment was spacious, and tidier than she’d expected, clearly the home of an\nintellectual bachelor, undecorated but full of shelves for books, magazines, and videocassettes. Shae\ndid not pause to pay attention to any of it beyond a cursory glance; they staggered into the single\nbedroom and pulled off each other’s clothes, dropping them to the floor. She pressed one hand to the\nsmall of Maro’s back and cupped his scrotum with the other. Her nipples rubbed against his chest; the\nslight scratchiness of his hair against her intensely sensitive skin made her quiver, as did the pulse of\ntheir jade auras, mingling and coalescing together like melding body heat.\nThey sank toward the bed. Shae pushed Maro’s hand between her legs as she stroked and\nfondled him, then shifted down to take him in her mouth. He tasted good—clean, but with that\nindescribable masculine odor. When he started gasping and thrusting, she pulled away. “Do you have\na—” she began, but Maro handed her a condom so quickly that she broke out laughing. She opened\nthe packet and unrolled it over him, feeling him shiver with anticipation.\n“Get me close with your mouth first,” she whispered, and pressed his shoulders down toward her\nhips. He went to work eagerly, and not without skill, and when Shae felt as if every muscle in her\nbody was strained on the utmost verge of clenching, she drew her legs up in open invitation. She\ngasped aloud as he entered her, grabbing his ass in encouragement. She tried to hold back, to draw out\nthe delicious climb, but several hard thrusts sent her careening over the edge, spasming and\nshuddering, her legs locked around his waist as the waves of her climax rolled through her and into\nhim, spurring Maro into a wild abandon. In minutes, his jade aura spiked as he crested. Maro cried\nout, head thrown back, spine arching above her.\nThey collapsed together. Maro kissed her shoulder and rolled aside, arms wrapped around her.\n“Thank you,” he murmured into the crook of her neck, his breath warm against her skin.\nWhen Shae awoke the next morning, she felt completely alert and clearheaded, as if the sex had\nswept through her system like a long overdue cleansing typhoon.

As she gazed\nat his long frame stretched out on the sheets, it occurred to her that he was a beautiful sight but also\nremarkably naked. Lying next to him in all of her jade—choker, bracelets, earrings, anklets—she felt\nalmost improperly overdressed. It had never even occurred to her to remove them.\nShe thought about staying where she was, sleeping in, making love again, walking out into Sotto\nVillage for brunch. Instead, she got up stealthily, wiped herself down with a towel from the bathroom,\nthen retrieved her strewn clothes and put them on. Dim sunlight framed the drawn curtains in Maro’s\nroom, and by their light she noticed things that she hadn’t the night before. Travel photos and prints\nof antique maps on the walls. An orange cat sunning itself on the windowsill. On the dresser, a framed\nphotograph of two little girls—perhaps six and four years old.\n“My nieces,” Maro said, answering her unspoken question in a sleep-thickened voice from the\nbed behind her. “It’s a photo from last year, though. I have more recent pictures, but I haven’t put\nthem in frames.”\nShae sat down on the edge of the bed and put a hand on his leg. “I had a wonderful time.”\nMaro reached out a hand and took her by the wrist. “Do you have to go so soon?”\nShe nodded and stood up reluctantly. “I have to sway the Pillar.”\nShae found her brother in the training hall behind the Kaul house, finishing up a morning practice\nsession with Master Aido. She could Perceive his heartbeat, his breath and exertion, before she slid\nopen the door. Tightly blindfolded and relying only on his sense of Perception, Hilo was weaving and\nslashing, the talon knife in his hand a blur as it scored the hard leather guards protecting Aido’s torso,\narms, and neck. The master moved astonishingly fast for a man with gray hair, his own knife darting\nout now and again to test Hilo’s Steel.\nAido had been a faculty member at Wie Lon Temple School many years ago, before he had a\npersonal falling out with the grandmaster and left to become a private trainer in the jade disciplines.\nLike jade-wearing physicians, teachers were not beholden to any one clan; Aido used to coach Green\nBones in both the major clans, but these days, he limited his client base primarily to the upper\nechelons of No Peak, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. There was a good living to be made as a\ntrainer; Green Bones who intended to advance on the Horn’s side of the clan paid handsomely to\ncontinue developing their prowess after graduation, and even those without strong martial ambitions\nwere advised to at least be diligent about maintaining their abilities, lest they end up weak and slow,\npotential targets for others. It was easy to slide backward in one’s jade proficiency, in the same way\nthat it was easy to gain weight—slowly and insidiously.\nThe kitchen timer on the counter rang. “Much better,” said Master Aido, lowering his arms.\n“Your knife work is confident again and you’re not slowing yourself down by over-Steeling.” Hilo"

My month is filling up fast.”\n“I’ll be sure to do that, Aido-jen,” Shae said.\nHilo finished draining his paper cup of water and tossed it into the trash bin. Wiping a towel over\nhis neck, he glanced at Shae standing by the door, then turned away from her and leaned his hands\nheavily on the counter, a pall of gloom over him. “I’m not sure I’ll ever be the same.”\nIt had taken Hilo many long months to recover from his injuries last year, and despite all the\nurgent demands on the Pillar’s time and attention, he seemed obsessed with building himself back\ninto fighting shape. Shae knew that he had at least two other coaches on retainer besides Master Aido.\nShe suspected that her brother’s preoccupation with his martial fitness was a way for him to avoid the\nparts of the Pillar’s job that were uninteresting or difficult for him. His fighting prowess as a Green\nBone—that was one thing he could understand and control.\n“You don’t need to be the best talon knife fighter anymore,” she said. “You have men to fight for\nyou.”\n“Strong men don’t fight for weak men.” Hilo walked past her to the door. “Have you had\nbreakfast?”\nAt the patio table, Kyanla brought them bowls of steamed eggs in broth and a plate of pastries.\nShae told Hilo about her conversation with Ree Tura and Ayt’s proposal for a formal meeting. “They\nwant to discuss the terms of a truce.”\n“A truce.” Her brother made a face. “That bitch has got some nerve.”\nShae took a bread roll and broke it in half. She called to mind Maro’s words from last night, the\nconfidence he’d tried to instill in her. You lead the clan as much as your brother does. You can make a\ndifference. “I think we should agree,” she said.\nTo her surprise, Hilo did not react immediately. He chewed quietly for several seconds, then\nsaid, “Why?”\n“I think you know why, Hilo. We’re at an impasse. Tar kicked off another bout of back-and-forth\nbloodshed, but it’s already petering out. The press coverage has been particularly harsh because\neveryone knows that by this point, the fighting is pointless. A year and half of open war has sapped\nboth our clans; neither of us is strong enough to win.”\n“Ayt tried her damnedest to finish us off last year and failed,” Hilo growled. “Now she comes\ncrawling to us hoping for a truce? Why should we let up when we have the advantage?”\n“We don’t have an advantage,” Shae said. “We don’t have the resources or manpower to control\nthe entire city even if we did take down the Mountain.

You said it yourself: This war is a boon for\ncriminals and smugglers, and the situation will only get worse so long as the clans keep losing people\non both sides. How much longer do you expect we can keep grinding it out for street territory?”\nShe’d made her point too argumentatively; Hilo gave her a dark look and said, “From what I\nhear, maybe longer than you can hold on to the office on Ship Street.” Shae grimaced but didn’t look\naway.\nHilo rubbed a hand over his eyes. “I’m not stupid, Shae,” he said less harshly. “I do look at those\nreports you put on my desk, once in a while. Jade mining’s halted, tourism’s down, our war expenses\nare high, people are upset—I get it. But do you believe for one second that Ayt’s suddenly become a\ndifferent person, that she’s willing to live peacefully from now on?”\nShae wrapped her fingers around the warm bowl of broth. It wasn’t hard to recall the Mountain\nPillar’s words to her last year, the utter certainty with which she promised the destruction of No Peak.\n“No,” Shae said. “Ayt’s staked everything on her vision of one-clan rule.”\n“Then no truce will last,” Hilo said. “The Mountain will only use it as an opportunity to build up\ntheir strength, to hit us in a worse way later.”\nShae nodded slowly. “It goes both ways, Hilo,” she said. “We need to build up our own strength,\nto plan a longer game. We can negotiate now and not forget they’re the enemy.”\nHilo slumped back in his chair with a snort of disgust. “People have the brains of chickens. A\nyear ago, the public was on our side, blaming the Mountain for hoarding jade and starting the war.\nNow they want to forget it all, give Ayt the keys to the KJA again, and have us hold hands nicely.”\n“Most people aren’t Green Bones,” Shae reminded him. “It’s not personal for them. They’re\nworried about the slowing economy, about crime and smuggling, and especially about the separatist\ncrisis in Oortoko turning into a war between the Espenians and the Ygutanians, right here in the East\nAmaric. We’re going to have the two largest military forces on the planet surrounding our small\nisland, the world’s only source of jade.” Shae studied her brother’s glum expression and added,\n“That’s why people don’t care about clan grievances anymore. They don’t just want us to stop\nfighting; they want us to cooperate to defend national interests. If we don’t, we may be dooming the\nclans and the country. That’s why we have to agree to meet with the Mountain.” In a quieter voice,\n“You know it’s what Lan would want us to do.”\n“Lan wanted a lot of things that he didn’t get.” Hilo fell silent and stared out across the\ncourtyard.

Shae waited; she and Hilo had sat out here many times over the past year—in\ndiscussion, fierce argument, or silence—and she’d come to recognize the particular feel of his jade\naura when she’d finally said something to convince him. Pushing Hilo too hard with factual\narguments would only make him irritable and defensive; he needed a genuine and personal reason to\njustify his choices.\n“I have to discuss it with Kehn,” Hilo said at last. He ate the rest of his bread roll in two quick\nbites and wiped his mouth with a napkin. “Tell Ree that we’ll talk. Set a time for after I get back from\nthe Uwiwa Islands.”\nCHAPTER\n8\nFamily Matters\nK\naul Maik Wen rushed to find her husband in their bedroom, packing up a few belongings for his\ntrip. “Hilo,” she gasped. She hadn’t meant to sound alarmed, but he must’ve Perceived her agitation\nbecause he dropped his wallet and talon knife on the bedspread and took her by the arms. “What’s\nwrong?” he demanded. “Are you all right?”\n“I’m fine,” Wen said. To tell the truth, she felt exhausted most of the time and had barely kept\nher breakfast down this morning, but that wasn’t why she’d come running up the stairs. The square\nenvelope and the papers clutched in her hand shook as she held them out to Hilo. “I found this among\nthe papers that you asked me to box up from the study.”\nHilo and Shae had left Lan’s bedroom and his study untouched for so long that upon moving into\nthe main house, Wen had taken it upon herself to deal with the situation. She’d liked Lan a great deal\nand mourned that she would never know him as a brother-in-law, but the dead no longer had any\nneeds. Better to take care of those who were still living. Wen had moved the furniture out of the\nbedroom and repainted it; she planned to turn it into a nursery. As part of her encouragement that Hilo\nchange the study to his liking, she’d placed Lan’s belongings and papers into boxes and moved them\nout. At first Hilo had resisted. “Just leave it; I’m not going to use that room anyway,” he told her.\nEventually, he’d seen the necessity and, being more than happy to let her handle it, had asked her to at\nleast sort through the boxes and hang on to anything important before storing or discarding the rest.\nThis morning, she’d been doing just that when she’d found the unopened envelope.\nIt was addressed to Lan, postmarked two weeks prior to his death. The return address was a\npostal box in Lybon, Stepenland. Wen handed her husband two pieces of folded paper, dense with\nhandwriting, and a photograph of a six-month-old baby.\n“What is this?” Hilo asked.\n“Your nephew,” Wen said. “Eyni was pregnant when she left Kekon.” Wen pointed to the top of\nthe letter, drawing his attention to the writing: I can’t think of any other way to tell you this: He’s\nyours.

It was obvious after he\nwas born—he has your nose, your eyes, even your expressions… that Kaul look. You know what I\nmean. His name is Nikolas, and he’s a beautiful, healthy baby.\nWen watched Hilo’s eyes travel in disbelief down the rest of the letter. She’d already read\nthrough it and knew how it ended. I know this is a shock. I’m not sure what to do now. Even though\nthings didn’t work out between us, I still want Niko to know his biological father. Maybe we should\ntalk about me returning to Kekon. I wouldn’t blame you if you don’t want anything more to do with\nme, but I’ve never stopped caring about you. Please write back.\nHilo put down the letter and studied the photo. “I don’t really see the resemblance she’s talking\nabout,” he said at last.\nWen snatched the picture from him. “You’re blind,” she exclaimed. True, the baby in the photo\nlooked much as all babies did—round-faced, wide-eyed, sweet and soft—but he was so obviously\nKaul Lan’s son that Wen wanted to splutter indignantly at her husband. “You have to write back to\nEyni.”\nHilo made a face and sat down on the edge of the bed. No one in the family had been in touch\nwith Lan’s ex-wife since she’d left. Surely, though, she must’ve heard of his death. “She’s not going\nto want to hear from me,” he said. “Eyni and I never got along very well. What am I supposed to say\nto her now?”\nWen crouched down next to her husband’s legs and stared insistently up into his face. She knew\nthat Hilo had never been fond of his brother’s wife, but what did that matter? His personal feelings\nabout Eyni weren’t nearly as important as doing what was right for this young child. As soon as Wen\nhad laid eyes on the photo of Nikolas, she’d felt her heart melting. “Tell her she can come back to\nJanloon,” Wen said. “She’s willing to return, but she needs the Pillar’s permission.”\n“She’d want to bring that foreigner back with her, the one she cheated on Lan with,” Hilo said,\nwith an edge in his voice.\n“Even so, I’m sure Lan would’ve set aside the issue of honor and allowed them to return if it\nmeant bringing his son back to Kekon.” Wen shoved the letter and the photo back onto Hilo’s lap.\n“Write back to Eyni and tell her that we discovered her letter just now. Tell her that she’s forgiven and\nthat she’s welcome to come home and raise her son in Janloon, where he can know his family. Niko\nmust be two years old by now. It’s not right for him to be living so far away, growing up in a jadeless\nculture and surrounded by foreigners.”\nHilo rubbed a hand over his eyes, but he nodded. “You’re right,” he said. “I won’t ever be able to\nthink of Eyni as my sister, but I’d put up with her and that man-whore she ran off with, for the sake of"

        "text": "think of Eyni as my sister, but I’d put up with her and that man-whore she ran off with, for the sake of\nthe kid.” He folded the letter and tucked it back into the envelope but kept looking at the photograph.\nWen could see him trying to internalize the idea of this baby being his nephew, who he hadn’t even\nknown existed. “Maybe you should be the one to write to Eyni,” he suggested.\nWen saw right away that it was a better idea. “Of course,” she agreed, standing up. “She’ll be\nmore likely to welcome the assurances of another woman. I’ll write back to her today and ask her to\ncome visit, so we can meet the baby.”\nShe could see Hilo warming to the idea now; it was like watching clouds in the sky break apart\nbeneath sunlight. He smiled in that boyish, lopsided way that Wen knew she could never adequately\ncapture on camera or in a drawing, though she had tried. Hilo handed the letter back to her but tucked\nthe photograph into his shirt pocket. “When you write to Eyni, let her know that I’m willing to put the\npast behind us. When she returns to Janloon, she’ll have the clan’s assistance. We’ll help her get a\nhouse, a job, whatever she needs. She’ll believe it more coming from you than me. And of course, I’d\ntreat Lan’s son like my own.”\nWen put her arms around Hilo’s neck and gave him a grateful kiss. Her husband could be\nshortsighted and stubborn; sometimes he hung on to strict principles or personal grudges that clouded\nhis better judgment, but he possessed the most valuable quality in any person, especially a clan leader,\nwhich was the ability to put others first, no matter the prevailing opinion or the personal cost.\nHilo wrapped an arm around her waist and placed the flat of his hand against her abdomen.\n“When can we tell people? After the old man’s funeral and everything else that’s been going on lately,\nwe need some good news around here.”\n“Let’s do it as soon as you get back,” Wen said. She was struck by a sudden pang of fear that her\nwords might’ve tempted misfortune to befall his trip. She tightened her grip around Hilo’s neck and\nconfessed, “I’m worried. I think your sister’s right; it’s not worth it for you to go to that place.”\n“I’ll have Tar with me,” Hilo said lightly.\n“So I’ll have to worry about both of you.”\nHilo gave her waist a reassuring squeeze. “The Mountain wants me dead. I’m in danger every\nday right here in Janloon. Why should you be especially anxious about this?”\nWen said, “Ayt is proposing a truce because she can’t afford to kill you right now. If she did, it\nwould plunge the city into further violence at a time when she doesn’t have the public support or\nstrength in warriors to handle it. You’re safer here.”\n“I see you’ve been talking to Shae,” Hilo said, with a touch of amusement and irritation. “The\ntwo of you have obviously thought things through, but you should trust that I have too.” Hilo stood\nup and finished packing a change of clothes and toiletries into a travel bag. “This crook Zapunyo"

        "text": "two of you have obviously thought things through, but you should trust that I have too.” Hilo stood\nup and finished packing a change of clothes and toiletries into a travel bag. “This crook Zapunyo\nrelies on being inconspicuous. He pays off the government and the police of the Uwiwa Islands in\norder to be able to run his jade smuggling ring. If he wanted to get rid of me, do you think he’d go to\nthe trouble of luring me onto his turf to do it there? An Uwiwan criminal murdering a Kekonese\ncitizen, the Pillar of a Green Bone clan, would be international news. He’d lose his impunity; both\ncountries’ governments would hunt him down. He’s not going to risk everything he’s built for that.”\nWen didn’t argue, but she couldn’t shake her apprehension as she watched Hilo stow his wallet\nand passport. She was accustomed to being left behind; as a child, she’d stood outside the entrance of\nKaul Dushuron Academy, watching her brothers walk ahead where she could never go. She’d seen\nthem grow into powerful men, earning jade and scars and respect in the clan that had once shunned\nthem.\nShe’d come by her own victories. When she was fourteen years old, her brothers brought home a\nfriend. This was a rare event; the Maiks received few visitors. Kaul Hilo was sixteen, the same age as\nTar, and already people in the clan were saying he was the fiercest of the Torch’s grandchildren, that\nhe was sure to one day become the Horn. On that evening and many others to come, Hilo ate dinner\ncheerfully at their meager table in Paw-Paw instead of his family’s grand house in Palace Hill. He\nwas respectful to their mother and teased Kehn and Tar as if they were his own brothers. When Wen’s\nmother snapped her fingers at Wen to refill their guest’s teacup, she shyly hurried to do so. Most\npeople avoided looking at or speaking to Wen for longer than necessary; they tugged their earlobes to\nward off the stone-eye’s bad luck. Hilo turned to thank her, and paused. His eyes rested on her face\nfor a prolonged moment, then he smiled and returned to the meal and to conversation with her\nbrothers.\nWen finished pouring tea and sat back down, hands in her lap, eyes on her own plate. Her face\nfelt as if it were on fire with a feverish certainty she’d never had in her life. That’s the boy I’m going\nto marry.\nShe had a great deal to be thankful for now, she knew that. Even being a stone-eye no longer\ntroubled her, as it allowed her to do useful things to help the Weather Man in the war against No\nPeak’s enemies. And hopefully there would be more joy in her life, soon. Yet the familiar feeling of\nbeing left behind—a queasy and helpless resentment lodged deep in the pit of her stomach—it never\nstopped being hard to take. “Don’t underestimate this man,” Wen whispered. “Promise me you’ll be\ncareful.”\nHilo picked up his sheathed talon knife and strapped it to his waist. “I promise.” He looked at his\nwatch, picked up his bag, and gave her a quick kiss on the mouth. “I’m going to be a father. I know\nthat changes things.”\nCHAPTER\n9"

I know\nthat changes things.”\nCHAPTER\n9\nThe Uwiwan and His Half Bones\nI\nt took just under two hours for the ten-seater turboprop plane to fly from Kekon to Tialuhiya, the\nlargest of the thirteen Uwiwa Islands. It had been wet and overcast in Janloon when Hilo left; he\nstepped out of the airplane into tropical heat and blinding sunlight. Waiting for them next to the\ntarmac were two white rental cars with drivers, which Hilo had asked Tar to arrange, alongside a\nwelcome party of ten armed men, which he had not, but was unsurprised to see.\nTar and his man Doun descended first; they flanked Hilo as he stepped off the plane’s folding\nstairs. One of the ten strangers came forward to meet them. He was tall and his features did not look\nUwiwan, but he was so tanned it was hard to tell. A thick gold chain with five green stones hung\naround his neck. “Kaul Hiloshudon, welcome to Tialuhiya,” he said in passable Kekonese. “Pas\nZapunyo has sent us to meet you and ensure that you’re conducted safely to his personal residence,\nwhere it will be his pleasure to host you.”\nHilo looked the man up and down, then drew his eyes over the others arrayed behind him. They\nwere all dressed similarly, in khaki pants and silk shirts, dark sunglasses, and green gemstones set\ninto heavy necklaces, chunky rings, and metal bracelets. Hilo’s lips fought down a smirk. “We’ll drive\nin our own cars,” he said. “You can escort us.”\nIn addition to Maik Tar and Doun, Hilo had brought with him three of Kehn’s men: the clan’s\nFirst Fist, Juen, and two Fingers, Vin and Lott. Hilo had been deliberate in his choices. Juen was one\nof No Peak’s best warriors, whose fighting skill could be counted on if anything went wrong, but he\nwas also No Peak’s most operational man in Janloon. Hilo wanted the chance to speak with him on\nthe plane, to keep abreast of what was happening on the ground and how Kehn was performing as\nHorn. Vin had been a Finger for two and half years and was on the cusp of being promoted to Fist.\nHilo had heard that he was one of the most talented Green Bones in No Peak when it came to\nPerception. Lott was only a junior Finger who’d graduated from the Academy last year, but he was\nthe son of a top No Peak Fist who’d been murdered by the Mountain at the height of the clan war.\nHilo had taken a personal interest in Lott; he would use this trip to get a better sense of the young\nman’s potential.\nHilo got into one of the rental cars with Tar and Lott; he sent Juen, Doun, and Vin ahead in the\nother. Zapunyo’s men climbed into their three identical silver sedans; one vehicle led the way, the\nother two brought up the rear.

The conspicuous convoy traveled for thirty minutes, first down a long,\nflat highway with sugarcane, tea, and fruit plantations stretching off to both sides in the shimmering\nheat, then up a winding, pitted road, into hills dotted with goats, roadside craft stands, and sun-\nwithered laborers in broad straw hats. Several of the workers flashed crooked-toothed smiles and\nwaved at the cars, then continued staring after them as they passed. The Uwiwans, Hilo thought, had\nthe cunning look of a race that knew they were dependent on the might and wealth of outsiders and\nhated themselves for it. They could be the friendliest sort of people during the day, then steal your\nwallet and cut your throat in the middle of the night.\nHere and there, Hilo saw faded road signs written in Shotarian. Even the newer signs in Uwiwan\nwere full of Shotarian loanwords, in the same way most Uwiwans had singular Shotarian or\nShotarian-influenced names. Like Kekon, the Uwiwa Islands had been occupied by the Empire of\nShotar prior to the Many Nations War. Unlike Kekon, there was not a pebble of jade in the entire\narchipelago, and no Green Bone clans to wage a long rebellion against the foreigners. Uwiwan\nopposition had been swiftly crushed and Shotarian rule ironclad for seventy years. After its defeat in\nthe Many Nations War, Shotar was forced to relinquish the Uwiwa Islands to its people, but\nindependence had yielded mixed results at best. Now the impoverished country was internationally\nknown for cash crops, beautiful tourist beaches, and jade smuggling.\n“Kaul-jen,” Lott spoke up as they drove. “Who are those men who work for Zapunyo?”\n“They’re barukan,” Hilo answered. “Shotarian gangsters.”\n“So much bluffer’s jade on that lot, it’s like they raided a costume shop,” Tar scoffed.\n“Don’t get cocky,” Hilo said sharply. “Where we’re going, there’ll be several of them for every\none of us. Just because of their tacky looks, you think they’re not dangerous?” He was still displeased\nwith Tar, for his recent carelessness and failure to find Lan’s killer and recover the family’s stolen\njade. The Pillarman fell into a silent sulk, his aura scratchy.\nThe wheels churned a long plume of dust as the cars turned onto a gravel road that crested a\nridge and sloped into a shallow valley between two hills. The convoy circled a man-made lake\nsurrounded by a garden of broad-leafed greenery and stone Uwiwan idols set among plantings of\ntropical flowers. At the end of the road on the far side of the lake sprawled a red two-story plantation\nmansion in the old Shotarian colonial style: large square windows below a gabled clay roof, a wide\nfront balcony supported by stone pillars, single-story wings fanning out on either side of the central\nstructure. The cars pulled up in front of the entrance.\nHilo had noticed the lookout towers with rifle-carrying sentries along the approach to the estate,\nand he counted many more guards around the house, in addition to the escorts who’d met them at the\nairport. As he got out of the car, he saw electronic locks on all the doors as well as security cameras"

As he got out of the car, he saw electronic locks on all the doors as well as security cameras\nand motion sensors discreetly tucked into every crevice of the traditional architecture. Zapunyo’s\nresidence was a lavish fortress. The lead barukan who’d spoken to them earlier went ahead of the\ngroup and held open the door. Hilo motioned Vin to walk next to him as they took the front steps into\nthe house. “How many?” he asked in a low aside.\n“Twenty-two people in and around the house, Hilo-jen,” Vin whispered. “Fourteen of them with\njade, but… not nearly as much as they’re pretending to show off.”\nHilo nodded in satisfaction at having his own assessment confirmed. “Stay alert,” he said, and\nVin nodded. The Finger’s sense of Perception was indeed excellent; most of the gemstones\nconspicuously worn by Zapunyo’s barukan bodyguards were inert, decorative nephrite—bluffer’s jade\nas the Kekonese called it. When he’d met the tanned leader, Hilo had noticed that only one of the five\ngreen stones on the man’s necklace was true jade. However, to anyone who was not a Green Bone\nand could not discern the incongruity in jade aura—which would be nearly all Uwiwans—the\nbarukan looked as intimidating and dangerous as the best warriors on Kekon. Though there was not a\nFist in No Peak who would wear his jade in such a clumsy manner, on dangling chains and bracelets,\nimpractical for actual combat.\nThe posturing did not, as Hilo had already reminded Tar, mean the men were not a threat, but it\ndid arouse the Pillar’s contempt. In Shotarian, the word barukan traditionally meant both guest and\nstranger, and was used in reference to an unwanted but unavoidable visitor, such as an inspector from\ncompany headquarters or an opinionated mother-in-law. In the past twenty years, however, the word\nhad become synonymous with Keko-Shotarian gangsters. During the foreign occupation of Kekon a\ngeneration ago, hundreds of thousands of displaced Kekonese were forcibly sent, or willingly\nmigrated, to Shotar. Their descendants were a marginalized minority in that country, and many turned\nto illegal jade and lives of crime.\nThe Kekonese call the barukan half bones and view them with disdain and pity.\nThe half bone mercenaries employed by Zapunyo escorted Hilo and his men up a wide, curving\nmarble staircase, through a spacious drawing room with a grand piano and tall bookcases, and out a\nset of open glass double doors onto the balcony overlooking the private lake. Zapunyo sat under a\nyellow shade at a large cast-top patio table, eating lunch. Three young men dined with him. The one\nto his right was the eldest, perhaps twenty-five. The other two were seated on the left; one man looked\nto be twenty, and the youngest was a teenager of about sixteen. They were obviously Zapunyo’s sons.\nThe barukan leader stopped at the foot of the table. “Pas,” he said, using the respectful honorific\ncommon to both Shotar and the Uwiwas. “Your guests have arrived.”"

Reliable sources said he was diabetic; his mother had also developed the disease in her\nforties and died from it. Zapunyo wore a loose yellow silk shirt and a pale blue kerchief tied around\nhis neck; a thin mustache twitched over dry lips. He appeared entirely Uwiwan, like a roughened\nplantation foreman, but it was well known that Zapunyo was half-Kekonese. His paternal bloodline\nand small doses of SN1, injected alongside daily insulin, gave him the jade tolerance necessary in his\nline of work. He wore no jade himself.\nThere was a single chair and place setting directly across from Zapunyo and his sons. Hilo sat\ndown in it. Tar stepped back to a corner of the patio, and the other four Green Bones positioned\nthemselves watchfully behind the Pillar. Zapunyo’s barukan bodyguards took up similar places\nbehind their boss. Hilo could not help but smile at the comical tableau: The two men faced each other\nacross a table spread with plates of tropical fruit, marinated vegetables, and cured meats, with a dozen\nheavily armed attendants standing around silently behind them. Zapunyo had arranged this scene as a\nmeeting between kings of equal rank. With his sons arrayed alongside him, the Uwiwan signaled that\nhe was the one who held state here.\nA servant came out and filled glasses with citrus-infused water. Hilo did not touch either the\nwater or the food, not because he thought Zapunyo would poison him, but because he did not entirely\ntrust the water sanitation in the Uwiwas. He leaned back in his chair. “Where’s Teije?”\nZapunyo was spooning out the flesh from a quarter wedge of papaya with a small silver spoon.\n“I suppose enjoying himself by the pool.” He put a mouthful of pink pulp in his mouth, mashed, and\nswallowed, then dabbed the corner of his mouth with his kerchief. “Your cousin for sure knows how\nto have a good time. Are you aware of how he got in trouble with the police? First, he walked into a\nnightclub wearing jade; you can’t do that here. Then he tried to have three women in the same night\nwhen the limit is two. He’s very lucky that I heard of his situation. The prisons in this country, they\ncan kill a man with disease before he ever gets a chance to stand in front of a judge. I wouldn’t want\nsuch a misfortune to cause bad relations between our countries.”\n“You can put him back in that cell for all I care,” said Hilo, “except that I’d feel bad seeing his\npoor mother cry. All your stalling and mincing of words to get me here in person—you’re obviously"

        "text": "poor mother cry. All your stalling and mincing of words to get me here in person—you’re obviously\nunder the impression that we have something to discuss. I came because I’m honestly curious to hear\nwhat a scavenger like you could possibly have to say to me as Pillar.”\nHilo had thought the smuggler would show some anger, or at least bristle, but Zapunyo merely\nnodded as if this was exactly what he’d expected. “You Green Bones, you have an old way of\nthinking,” he said, fixing Hilo with small, beetle black eyes. “I suppose some Kekonese still believe\nthat jade comes from Heaven, that you’re descendants of Jenshu and closest to the gods out of all\nraces. I’ve heard those stories myself. So you cling to jade, you hold on to it so tight, as if it were\nyour very souls that might be snatched. Instead of thinking in an open-minded way about how you\ncan share this wonderful gift you have with the rest of the world.”\n“And that’s what you do,” Hilo said sardonically. “Share jade with the world.”\n“I’m an entrepreneur,” said Zapunyo. “I see the need and I fill that need. If there is demand for\nsomething, and the normal suppliers are not doing a good job, then of course that is where there is a\nbusiness opportunity. My Kekonese father, he gave nothing to me and my mother, nothing but pain\nand sorrow, but because of him, I learned to take care of myself. And from my blessed mama I\nlearned to share what little I had with others. So that’s why I wish to talk with you.”\nHilo looked out across the glimmering lake and wondered how much of Zapunyo’s wealth from\nblack market jade dealing it had taken to construct this artificial oasis in the hills, to build, man, and\nfortify his property, and to pay off all the required officials. Zapunyo called his organization Ti\nPasuiga—The Tribe in Uwiwan. He had jade-wearing subordinates and enforced oaths of loyalty from\nthose in his employ. The smuggler might disdain Kekonese ways and beliefs, but that didn’t stop him\nfrom taking on the trappings of clan to suit his own purposes. Hilo turned back. “You baited me here\nto make me a business proposal. So make it.”\nZapunyo speared some pickled green beans and slices of eggplant onto his plate. “My business,\nlike any other, relies on people. But it is hard to find and keep workers when Green Bones are so\nquick to kill anyone who tries to take even a little jade out of the country. A clan as powerful as No\nPeak, you have more important things to concern yourselves with. Your territories in Janloon must be\ndefended against enemies; you need men and money to do that—so why spend any energy on things\nthat don’t hurt anyone? There is no reason at all for us to be against one another. I am not a greedy\nman. I was born poor, and even now, I’m content to take only the scraps from Kekon and even to\nshare what little I make.”\nHilo nodded. “You want me to stop killing your rockfish, in exchange for a cut of the profits you\nmake off the black market jade you smuggle from our shores.”"

        "text": "share what little I make.”\nHilo nodded. “You want me to stop killing your rockfish, in exchange for a cut of the profits you\nmake off the black market jade you smuggle from our shores.”\n“You accept tribute from all sorts of businesses, Kaul Hilo. Do you look down upon the money\nthat comes from a brothel as opposed to a grocer? Kekon sells jade to the governments of Espenia and\nits allies—is their money better than mine?” For the first time, a hint of dangerous affront rose in the\nsmuggler’s slow, dry voice. He turned his head to either side to indicate his sons. The eldest was\neating heartily and noisily, glancing up now and then from his plate, but seemingly unconcerned by\nany of the conversation. His two brothers glowered at Hilo like dogs with their hackles raised.\nZapunyo said, “My sons here have much more than I did growing up, a much better life. It is a\ncomfort to me to know that one day they will take over the business, and if anything bad should\nhappen to me, they would remember my enemies. Getting older, I think less and less about myself\nand more and more about how I want to pass what I gain in this life to my children and my children’s\nchildren. Do you have children yet, Kaul-jen?”\n“No,” said Hilo.\n“Gods willing, perhaps you will someday soon be so blessed. Then you will understand that I am\njust like any other father and businessman. You, Kaul-jen, you want your family and your country to\nbe safe and prosperous—and jade is what makes that happen.” Zapunyo waved vaguely to indicate\nhis house, his sons and attendants, the whole of the Uwiwa Islands. “You cannot say that we are so\ndifferent, can you?”\nHilo pushed his untouched plate out of the way and shifted forward in his seat. It was a small\nmovement, there was no outward threat in it at all, but his Green Bones, and the barukan guards with\nany sense of Perception, tensed at the change in his jade aura. “The two of us have as much in\ncommon as your barukan have with Green Bones. Nothing.” The Pillar spoke in a voice soft with\nscorn as he laid an unmoving stare on the Uwiwan. “Jade is only a thing to you, to be stolen and sold.\nIt’s why you don’t wear any of it yourself. You wanted to speak your mind to me in person, and I can\nappreciate that. I came for the same reason, so I could tell you in the simplest terms: Stay off Kekon.\nYou’re no Lantern Man and you’ll get no accommodation from No Peak. If desperate Abukei want to\nrisk their lives ferrying jade to you, that’s one thing. But there’s a difference between a dog that picks\ngarbage outside your house, and one that jumps through your window to steal from your table. One is\na nuisance you can ignore; the other is a problem and has to be killed.\n“I know you have agents in Janloon recruiting Kekonese criminals to be your rockfish. I know\nyou land boats on remote parts of the coastline and send bands of pickers to scavenge from the mine\nsites. My orders to my Fists and Fingers are to kill any of the thieves they catch. Don’t get me wrong;"

The mines suspended,\nthe Mountain and No Peak at war, and now, the conflict in Shotar that will raise the black market even\nmore. But don’t think jade makes your posse of half bones into a clan, and don’t imagine for a second\nthat money makes you a Pillar.” At last, Hilo felt Zapunyo’s anger, saw the man’s mouth below his\nmustache tighten into a wrinkled line. Hilo’s upper lip curled. “You should get out of the smuggling\nbusiness while you’re on top. Go any further, bring your stink to Kekon, and you’ll lose it all. Green\nBones can’t be bought with your dirty Uwiwan money.”\n“Money is money—all if it is dirty, and anyone can be bought.” The country cordiality that\nZapunyo had displayed before was suddenly gone; his small eyes were hooded, and he had the look\nof a mongoose with needle-sharp teeth. “It was my mistake to think you might be a sensible man, a\nsmart man. We both know you have enemies I could go to instead.”\nHilo laughed. “Go ahead and try. Ayt Madashi would just as soon snap your neck. The Mountain\nmurdered my brother and went to war with my family to control Kekon’s jade. If Ayt won’t\ncompromise with other Green Bones, you think she’ll deal with you?” Hilo stood up, smoothly and\nquickly. Iyilo and the other barukan nearest Zapunyo moved their hands toward their guns; Hilo felt\nTar and his men shift forward, their auras humming. Hilo said calmly to Zapunyo, “You bailed out my\nworthless relative and showed him hospitality in your own home, so even though I’m a Green Bone\nand you’re a jade thief and by all rights I ought to kill you, let’s say there’s no need for us to ruin this\npleasant afternoon. We’ve had a good talk; now we know where we each stand. Anything that comes\nafterward, even if it’s unpleasant, should come as no surprise to either of us.”\nZapunyo did not move from his seat. He put a final slice of cold, seasoned meat into his mouth\nand his jaw ground back and forth as he stared at Hilo with eyes made squinty by unforgiving years\nof dust and sun. The smuggler laced his stumpy fingers and rested them across his stomach. “Of\ncourse, I’m disappointed,” he said. “I did the clan a great favor, I invited you into my house and\noffered you food and drink, and I’ve been given no thanks. You Green Bones put such importance on\nyour honor, but if you won’t extend courtesy to others, you’ll be left behind in the world. It’s true,\nwhat you say, though: There’s no need to ruin this lovely afternoon. I am not a prideful man, Kaul-\njen, and what little pride I have, I am used to swallowing. That’s how it is when you start off with\nnothing in life and learn never to take anything for granted.”\nZapunyo waved his hand nonchalantly toward the patio doors. “You are welcome to take your"

Iyilo will see you out.”\nThey found Teije Runo, as Zapunyo had said, lounging beside the pool behind the mansion, a drink in\none jade-ringed hand, a slender young woman in a bathing suit stretched out on her stomach on the\ntowel next to him. A record player on a stand turned out Espenian jiggy songs. Hilo walked up and\nstood over the man. Teije stirred and removed his sunglasses; apparently, he’d been dozing. He stared\nat Hilo for several befuddled seconds, then clambered hastily to his feet, setting down his drink and\nstraightening his swim trunks. “Cousin Hilo,” he exclaimed, spreading his arms in delight and\nsurprise.\nHilo struck the man across the face. Teije stumbled and let out a pained exclamation. Hilo hit\nhim again, sending the man sprawling. Teije’s foot caught his drink glass; it toppled over and broke.\nThe young woman in the bathing suit shrieked and scrambled away, shouting in Uwiwan as Hilo\nkicked Teije viciously in the side. “Kaul-jen, please, wait, stop,” Teije wheezed, crawling away from\nthe Pillar on hands and knees. Hilo followed; he kicked his relative in the stomach and the crotch,\nthen hit him several more times in the face and body.\nTeije Runo was not a small man—he was half a head taller than Hilo, with broad shoulders and\nlong arms, and he kept himself fit—but he put his arms over his head and curled into a ball as Hilo’s\nblows descended. The woman ran screaming into the house. Iyilo stood to the side and watched, as\ndid the other barukan and Hilo’s own men. Tar snickered in amusement. When Hilo was done, none\nof Teije’s bones were broken, but his oiled body bloomed with bruises and he moaned piteously.\n“Get up and put on your clothes,” Hilo said. “We’re leaving.”\nCHAPTER\n10\nA Ridiculous Waste\nT\nhey left Zapunyo’s estate fifteen minutes later. The barukan in their silver cars did not escort them\nthis time; Hilo did not ask, and Iyilo did not offer. The darkly tanned half bone stood at the front\nentrance, watching their departure, his expression carefully guarded. As Hilo got into the car, he\nPerceived the unmistakable pulse of hostility in the bodyguard’s jade aura. Iyilo might be a hired\nShotarian goon, but he and those like him had reason to resent and hate people like the Kauls. Jade\nand lineage made Green Bones the historical heroes and unofficial rulers of Kekon; the same traits\nmade the barukan criminals and outsiders in Shotar. Hilo was quite certain that, if given the word by\nZapunyo, Iyilo and his men would be eager to prove themselves just as worthy of jade as their\nKekonese guests, by killing the whole lot of them."

        "text": "Zapunyo, Iyilo and his men would be eager to prove themselves just as worthy of jade as their\nKekonese guests, by killing the whole lot of them.\nThis time, Hilo took Tar, Vin, and Teije in the first car with him and sent Juen, Doun, and Lott in\nthe other. Teije, thoroughly cowed and blotting his lip with ice wrapped in a paper towel, was silent\nthroughout the drive. Tar rolled down the windows and said, “Did you see how that runt and his\nbarukan dogs couldn’t even look us in the eyes back there? They let us walk right out. If they’re the\ntoughest men in the Uwiwas, it’s no wonder this country is such shit.”\nHilo did not respond; he’d chastised Tar once already today and didn’t want his Pillarman further\ndistracted. Tar sometimes ran off his mouth when he was feeling insecure. He was loyal and fierce,\nbut he didn’t have a strategic mind. As Hilo had said to Wen, Zapunyo would not have tried to harm\nthem on his own estate. Too risky for him, too much exposure.\nHilo tilted the car seat back and closed his eyes. He appeared as if he was resting, perhaps trying\nto take a nap. The sun beat down on his face; the inside of his vision was a wall of red that colored\neven his sense of Perception as he extended it, scanning, fully alert. As they entered the airport road,\nHilo sat up and opened his eyes. Five police cars and two motorcycles were parked in front of the\nrunway where their small charter plane lay waiting. “Vin,” Hilo said.\n“Twelve men,” the Finger said at once. “Hilo-jen… they’re here to kill us.”\nHilo nodded, but Teije Runo, speaking for the first time since they’d left Zapunyo’s estate,\nexclaimed in a panicked voice, “They’re here for me. They think I’m jumping bail.”\n“They don’t give a shit about you,” Hilo said. “They’re on Zapunyo’s payroll.” Two of the\nofficers motioned for them to pull over; Hilo told the driver to obey. The other car pulled up behind\nthem. Hilo turned around to speak to Teije. “You stay in the car,” he ordered. “I promised your ma I’d\nbring you home safe, but disobey me, and I’ll break her fucking heart.”\nHilo got out of the car. His Green Bones followed. “Hands up! Put hands up!” one of the police\nofficers ordered through a bullhorn. The fact that he addressed them in broken Kekonese was another\nsign that he knew exactly who they were, that this had been arranged beforehand. Hilo raised his\nempty hands over his head and began to walk forward.\n“Stop!” the officer with the bullhorn shouted. He sounded frightened. “Stop now! This is final\nwarning!”\nHilo did not stop, but continued ahead with slow, deliberate paces. “You understand Kekonese?”\nhe called out. “You can’t stop us from getting on that plane. But I’m giving you a chance to leave.\nGreen Bones don’t kill those without jade. Unless they break our laws or side with our enemies.”\nHilo’s Perception clamored with galloping heartbeats.

        "text": "Green Bones don’t kill those without jade. Unless they break our laws or side with our enemies.”\nHilo’s Perception clamored with galloping heartbeats. Behind him, he could sense the tension in\nhis men, their jade auras straining forward like horses behind the starting gates, and in front of him,\nthe stench of fear and grim determination. Hilo slowed. “Even if Zapunyo owns this island, and you\nhave to take money from him, it’s not worth your lives,” he called out. He took another step forward.\nThe police opened fire.\nHilo was already moving; he thrust his arms down sharply, unleashing a wide, descending\nDeflection that swept over the hail of bullets like a vertical gale wind. The scared policemen had\novercompensated and fired wastefully. All of the initial shots—at least thirty—had been directed at\nHilo. It was what he’d intended when he walked out alone; focused fire was more easily Deflected.\nThe volley of disrupted gunfire tore up the tarmac well short of its target, though a few bullets sailed\nclose enough that Hilo flinched with Steel.\nHis Green Bones rushed in. Tar’s and Juen’s auras blazed with Strength and Lightness as they\nbounded over the row of squad cars, Tar landing amid the cluster of officers with drawn talon knife,\nJuen warping the roof of one of the vehicles as he dropped onto it in a crouch, straightened up with a\npistol in each hand, and began firing precise shots into the line.\nDoun, Vin, and Lott were not far behind their Fists. Two of the Uwiwans turned and fled toward\nthe airplane; Lott drew a pair of slim throwing knives he carried sheathed against the small of his\nback and hurled them together along with a razor-thin Deflection that deftly parted the trajectory of\nthe blades. They sailed through the air like twin prongs, catching one man between the shoulders and\nanother in the back of the neck.\nHilo strolled into the melee, talon knife in hand; he seized one man and cut his throat from\nbehind. Another policeman abandoned his empty handgun and swung a black truncheon at Hilo’s\nskull with whistling force. Hilo slid his head under the arc and slashed the man across the inside of\nthe forearm. The truncheon fell from the man’s nerveless grasp and Hilo caught it in his left hand\nbefore it hit the ground. With a burst of Strength, he twisted his weight into a strike that smashed the\nUwiwan across the knees with the length of the steel, then he uncoiled and slammed the butt of the\nweapon into his opponent’s chin, breaking the man’s jaw as he fell.\nHilo looked around for the next adversary, but there was nothing left for him to do. His men\nwere accustomed to fighting other Green Bones, and this had not been anything similar to that. Their\nopponents were poorly trained and had no real abilities; they were not even Kekonese. Looking\naround at the bodies, Hilo was struck by a swift and powerful hatred for the smuggler Zapunyo—\nnearly as strong as what he felt for his enemy Ayt Mada.

The Uwiwan criminal kingpin sat safe in his\nluxurious stronghold, guarded by barukan who might have been a real contest for Green Bones, but\nhe did not risk them or himself. He had ordered corrupt policemen to see to it that Hilo was killed\nresisting arrest.\nSuch a ridiculous waste.\nSome of the men on the ground were not dead, but since none of them posed a threat any longer,\nHilo told his Fists to leave them. They went back to the cars and gathered their belongings as well as\nTeije Runo, who blanched when he saw the scene and let himself be led meekly to the plane. The\nKekonese pilot was an associate of the clan; he had not radioed in the disturbance, instead waiting\npatiently as instructed.\nJuen’s shoulder had been grazed in the gunfire, and Doun had taken a bullet clean through the\ncalf. “I was careless, Kaul-jen,” he said, grimacing in pain but looking embarrassed to have been\ninjured in such a one-sided battle. Hilo found the first aid kit in the airplane’s cabin storage and\npassed it back but told the pilot to take off immediately. The twin-engine aircraft sped down the\nrunway and lifted into the sky, leaving the bloody tarmac and lush green fields of Tialuhiya far below.\nOn the way home, Hilo checked on Juen and Doun. He made sure their bleeding was under control\nand that they were kept hydrated with the soda in the onboard cooler. Tar was in a more relaxed mood\nnow; it seemed their violent exit had purged some of his earlier frustration. He stretched out across a\nrow of seats and napped. Hilo went to sit beside Lott, who was in the farthest row back, staring out\nthe window at the ocean below.\nHilo said, “I’ve only met one other Green Bone who can throw knives that well, and direct them\nwith Deflection no less.”\n“My father, I know,” said Lott, still staring out the window. The young man was upset and\nconfused, that much Hilo could tell from the persistent churning of his jade aura, though like a typical\nteenager, he pretended otherwise.\n“You’re not much like your da in other ways,” Hilo said.\nThe young man’s shoulders stiffened. “I’m sorry if I disappoint you, Kaul-jen.”\n“That’s not what I said,” said Hilo. “Your father was as green as they come, one of my most\nfearsome and loyal Fists, let the gods recognize him. But he could be cruel for no reason and he\ndidn’t care for most people. You don’t seem that way to me.”\n“I killed those men, didn’t I? I know you brought me along to see how I’d perform.”\nHilo was certain the young man would never speak to the Pillar of the clan with such candid\nresentment under other circumstances, but he’d taken a life for the first time and was emotional, not\nknowing the proper way to react. There was no proper way, Hilo knew; people reacted differently.\nSome threw up, some were exhilarated, others felt nothing.\n“You only killed one of them,” Hilo said. “The one you got in the neck, yes, but the other one"

The Finger didn’t answer or even turn his head.\n“Lott-jen, look at the Pillar when he speaks to you,” Hilo demanded, his voice sharp.\nThe young man flinched, in the way of a boy accustomed to punishment, and turned quickly\ntoward Hilo with guilt in his eyes. His expression flickered briefly between doubt and defiance, but he\ndared not meet Hilo’s commanding stare; he dropped his gaze and murmured, “Forgive my\ndisrespect, Kaul-jen.”\nEver since he’d first met Lott, Hilo had noticed him to be a moody, sulky sort of teen, which\ncould be forgiven for a short while, but the man was a Green Bone now; he had to learn how to\nbehave. Hilo’s eyes did not shift or lose their sternness, but after another minute had passed, he said\nin a much gentler voice, “I’ll always forgive a friend, because otherwise how could people be honest\nwith each other? I didn’t bring you on this trip to make you prove yourself. I brought you because you\nstood in front of me ahead of all your classmates last year and took your oaths first—that’s something\nI’d remember. When it comes to which brothers I want to get to know, which ones I want fighting\nnext to me if it comes to life or death, that sort of thing is important.”\nLott did not look back up, but after a second, he gave a nod and his jade aura settled into a\ngrudging but calmer hum. Hilo turned around in his seat and reached into the cooler to pull out two\nmango sodas; he opened them and handed one to Lott, who accepted it and drained half the bottle.\nHilo said, “Those men you fought today—you didn’t know them and they’d done you no\npersonal offense. That’s why it bothers you to have killed them. It’s only natural to feel that way; if\nwe didn’t, we’d be no better than animals. There are some people who are like that, of course, even\nsome Green Bones, but thankfully not too many.”\nHilo drank from his own soda bottle. “People are born selfish; babies are the most selfish\ncreatures, even though they’re helpless and wouldn’t survive a day on their own. Growing up and\nlosing that selfishness—that’s what civilization is, that’s what sets us above beasts. If someone harms\nmy brother, they harm me—that’s what our clan oaths are about. Those men weren’t your enemies—\nthey were our enemies. You can understand that, can’t you, Lott Jin?”\nThe Finger hesitated. “Yes, Kaul-jen.”\nHilo put a warm hand on Lott’s shoulder and left it there for a moment, then rose and went to\nanother seat to give the young man space to be by himself and think.

When he’d been Horn, Hilo had\nconsidered it a vital part of his job to see to it that new Fingers were coached along, and that those\nwith the most promise were noticed and mentored. He was still unsure about Lott, but he was glad\nthat he’d had this chance to speak to the young man personally; sometimes those few words mattered.\nHilo finished his soda and set the bottle on the empty seat next to him. He leaned his head next\nto the small window and stared out to the distant horizon. The noise and vibration of the propeller\nplane droned in his skull. Midway between the Uwiwa Islands and home, there was nothing to see but\nocean and more ocean separating Kekon from its nearest neighbors. On the other side of that\nseemingly endless expanse of water lay the country of Espenia and the city of Port Massy where\nAnden was now living.\nHilo glanced across the aisle at his blood cousin Teije Runo, still morosely icing his bruised face,\nand felt a savage desire to push him out of the airplane and watch him fall a long way into the ocean\nbelow. When he turned back to the window, Hilo was frowning, and his frown grew deeper and more\npensive than the one he’d tried to ease off Lott.\nCHAPTER\n11\nPort Massy\nT\nhe week after his adoptive grandfather’s funeral, Anden boarded an eleven-and-a-half-hour flight\nout of Janloon International Airport. He felt as if he were entering the cell that housed prisoners on\nthe night before execution. Only, instead of a shoebox-sized shrine and a penitent to guide meditation\nprayers that might ease his conscience in preparation for the afterlife, there were stacks of tattered\ngossip and lifestyle magazines and stewardesses moving through the circulating haze of cigarette\nsmoke to offer blankets and hot tea.\nAnden took a sleeping pill and knocked himself out for most of the trip. When he awoke, the\nplane was coming in for a landing, and groggily, he opened the window shade to get a first glimpse of\nthe foreign city he’d been exiled to. Like a vast, spiky beast asleep under a blanket, the metropolis of\nPort Massy lay sprawled beneath a thick layer of fog, tinted orange by the late-afternoon sun. Steel\nand concrete skyscrapers jutted up in dense clumps on the tidal banks where the great Camres River\nemptied into Whitting Bay and met the North Amaric Ocean. Anden searched for landmarks he’d\nseen in photographs and on television: the Iron Eye Bridge, the Mast Building, the Port Guardian\nstatues. Even up until now, he had not really believed that he was leaving Kekon, but at last it seemed\nreal, and when the landing wheels of the airplane bumped against the tarmac, his heart answered with\na thud of awe and fear.\nIn the baggage claim area, he picked up his suitcase and stood nervously scanning the crowd\nuntil he saw an elderly Kekonese couple holding a sign with his name written on it. He approached\nthem and said, “Mr. and Mrs. Hian?” They looked at him in surprise, as if he was not who they had\nbeen expecting.

Thank you for opening your\nhome to me. May the gods shine favor on you for your kindness.” He touched his clasped hands to his\nforehead and tilted into a respectful salute.\nIf the couple had been initially confused by Anden’s appearance, they were put at ease by his\nfluent Kekonese and respectful manners. “Ah, it’s no trouble for us; we like to host students,” said\nMr. Hian, smiling now and touching his forehead in greeting. His wife did the same, and asked, “How\nwas your flight? It’s very long, isn’t it? We’ve only been back to Kekon twice since we moved here;\nthat flight, it’s too long! My old body can’t take it anymore.” Her husband tried to take Anden’s\nsuitcase, which Anden quickly insisted on relieving him of, and the couple led the way out of the\nairport to the short-term parking lot.\nMr. Hian drove, with Mrs. Hian in the front passenger seat. It was the smallest, oldest car that\nAnden had ever been in, with brown fabric upholstery, a faux wood dash, and windows that only\nrolled down halfway. Anden sat in the back, staring out at the passing streets and buildings. The air\nwas humid, but nothing like Janloon’s fragrant sweat; the dampness here felt cool and ashy. Steam\nrose from grates in the sidewalks as people hurried past storefronts with mannequins displaying\nbright, tinselly clothes. Buskers drummed, largely ignored, on upturned metal pails outside a train\nstation. Double-decker buses spewed black exhaust. The largest city in Espenia seemed a sunless and\nunfriendly place, a picture of frenetic activity against a sepia canvas of brick and concrete. And\neverywhere he looked, he saw Espenians.\n“So, do you have family in Espenia?” Mr. Hian asked casually.\n“No,” replied Anden, and because he recognized the seemingly mild question for what it really\nwas—an inquiry into his ancestry—he said, “My father was Espenian, but I was born in Kekon. This\nis my first time here.” It felt strange to even speak of his father, some foreign serviceman he’d never\nknown and had no desire to. Even more strange to think he was in the man’s homeland.\nMr. and Mrs. Hian lived in a part of the city called Southtrap on the lower side of the Camres. It\nwas a working-class, largely immigrant neighborhood with multistory brick apartment buildings\npacked close together in a manner that reminded Anden of the Paw-Paw or Forge districts in Janloon.\nHis host family lived in one of the better homes: a yellow, two-story row house facing onto a busy\ntwo-lane street. Anden carried his suitcase into the house and up the narrow staircase to the guest\nbedroom, which overlooked an alley in the back. It was about the size of his dormitory room at the\nAcademy, much smaller than the bedroom he’d become accustomed to in the Kaul family’s beach"

It was about the size of his dormitory room at the\nAcademy, much smaller than the bedroom he’d become accustomed to in the Kaul family’s beach\nhouse in Marenia. It was homey, though; the bedspread was thick and soft, and a watercolor print of a\nmisty mountain hung on the wall above the headboard. A vase on the dresser held three sprigs of blue\nfabric flowers.\nMrs. Hian made a proper Kekonese dinner of blackened chicken in milk, sautéed greens, and\nnoodles with garlic sauce. Anden was immensely grateful for the familiar food and had no trouble\neating several servings to show his appreciation. “Eat as much as you can,” Mrs. Hian encouraged\nhim. “Espenian food is not very good. I always tell my son to come home for dinner more often, but\nhe’s so busy and the traffic is too difficult. That’s why he’s losing weight.” The Hians had two sons.\nThe eldest, which Mrs. Hian was referring to, lived in the north part of the city but worked in sales for\na medical equipment company and traveled a great deal. He was the one who’d brought his parents\nover to Espenia a decade ago. Their younger son was studying to earn his doctorate in history at\nWatersguard University in Adamont Capita. “A useless degree,” Mr. Hian sighed. “But children do\nwhat they want.”\nAfter dinner, Mrs. Hian cleared the plates and Anden brought out the gifts Shae had instructed\nhim to give: a bottle of expensive hoji, an envelope of cash in Espenian thalirs, and a green ceramic\nteapot, wrapped with newspaper to keep it safe during the journey. The hoji and money were mere\ntokens; Anden was sure that the couple would be paid on a monthly basis for housing him. The teapot\nwas more meaningful. Mr. Hian lifted the lid. The circular insignia of the No Peak clan was stamped\non the inside. A gift of something green, marked with the symbol of the clan, connoted the friendship\nof Green Bones and conferred status on the recipient. Presented to a person outside the clan, it meant\na favor had been done and would at some point be returned.\nThe couple thanked Anden warmly and put the teapot on a shelf in the kitchen next to\nphotographs of their sons. Mr. Hian offered Anden a glass of the fine hoji and they enjoyed it together\nat the dining table. “Are people in Kekon worried about the war?” he asked.\nAnden was initially confused. For a moment he thought his host was referring to the clan war\nbetween the Mountain and No Peak. “You mean the conflict in Shotar,” he said, once he realized\notherwise. “I think so. I haven’t been keeping up with the news very well, though.” He didn’t explain\nthat he’d spent the past year keeping his disgraced head down in a sleepy coastal village.\n“The Oortokon War is being talked about a lot here,” said Mr. Hian. The eastern province of\nShotar known as Oortoko (Ortykvo in Ygut) sat along the border of Ygutan and had long been a\ndisputed area populated by many ethnic Ygutanians.

The Shotarian government rejected the unilateral\ndeclaration and sent troops to the region to suppress the rebellion, only to find themselves facing a\nwell-equipped fighting force not-so-covertly trained and backed by the Ygutanians. The Shotarians\nappealed to Espenia for help.\n“If Espenian troops are sent to fight the rebels in Shotar, it may turn into a war against Ygutan.”\nMr. Hian shook his head with concern. “My nephew tells me that Kekon will also be affected because\nthe Espenians will use it as a base, and they will demand jade for their soldiers.”\n“I’m sure he’s right,” said Anden. “The people working in the Weather Man’s office would know\nwhat’s going on.” Mr. Hian’s nephew was a senior Luckbringer in the clan’s Ship Street office tower;\nhe’d been an Academy classmate of Kaul Lan and Woon Papidonwa and had vouched to Shae that his\nuncle would take care of Anden while he was in Espenia.\n“What about you, Anden?” asked Mrs. Hian curiously. “Are you of rank in the clan?” She did\nnot say “a member of the clan” or “part of the clan.” The majority of people in Janloon could claim to\nbe affiliated with one of the Green Bone clans, but being “of rank” was different—it referred to a\nposition of status and usually meant someone who wore jade.\nPerhaps Mr. Hian’s nephew had told them that Anden was a graduate of Kaul Dushuron\nAcademy. They must be confused by the fact that they had not seen any green on him. Anden\nhesitated; he didn’t want to lower his hosts’ regard for him, but he didn’t want to be dishonest either.\n“I was, but my cousin is the Pillar and he decided I should come to Espenia to study.” For an instant,\nhe pretended to himself that he was referring to Lan instead of Hilo, and suffered a pulse of self-pity\nand grief; he would not be in this situation at all if Lan were still alive.\nThe Hians nodded, no doubt sensing there was more to Anden’s story, but refraining from\ninquiring further. “You’re lucky to have a family that’s so powerful and able to sponsor your\neducation, even if it means sending you to the other side of the world,” said Mr. Hian. “You must be\nvery tired, though. We should all go to sleep.”\n“Mr. Hian,” Anden began, but the man raised a hand to interrupt him.\n“Your cousin put you in our care,” said the old man. “While you’re here in Espenia, think of us\nas your family. Ask anything of us that you would ask your own kin.”\nAnden nodded. “Uncle, do you like living in Espenia?”\nMr. Hian scratched his beard and looked thoughtful. “Well enough,” he replied. “Of course, it’s\nnot Kekon. The food, the language, the Espenians and their ways will always be a little strange to us.\nBut there are good things about it as well. And most importantly, it’s where our sons are. Your home\nis always where your family is.” His wife nodded in agreement."

Your home\nis always where your family is.” His wife nodded in agreement.\nAnden’s long, drug-induced nap on the airplane flight made it so that he couldn’t fall asleep\nwhen he went to bed. The dorm at the Academy, the Kaul residence in Janloon, and his room in the\nMarenia beach house had all been quiet spaces separated from the bustle of the city. Now he could\nhear people and cars and sirens and other urban noise all night, right outside his window. Anden lay\nawake for several hours, feeling utterly miserable.\nShae had enrolled him in the Immersive Espenian for Speakers of Other Languages (IESOL) program\nat Port Massy College. The spring term began the following week. Mr. Hian showed Anden where to\ntake the bus and rode with him the first day. Anden knew a total of about thirty words in Espenian,\nmostly from pop culture; there’d been a class at the Academy, but he’d only taken one semester\nbefore dropping it in favor of a supplemental Deflection elective. At the time, he couldn’t see how\nspeaking Espenian would be of any use to him. Proficiency in the jade disciplines was far more\nimportant if he was to become a Fist of No Peak.\nThere were fifty students in the program, hailing from all over the world. There were four Tuni\nand two Shotarians in the class, but Anden was the only Kekonese. The teacher was a bearish woman\nwith hair the color of wheat. When Anden answered her question about where he was from, she\ninitially thought he said, “Callon,” a city in Stepenland. The students were seated together at round\ntables and encouraged to get to know each other. Anden decided that he would be polite, but he was\nnot here to make friends—which was just as well since during the lunch break, social groupings\nquickly formed based on ethnic background. Anden might’ve tried to join in at the table of Tuni\nyouths, but he did not, as he was instinctively distrustful of them; the Kekonese view themselves as\nsuperior to neighboring races.\nIn Anden’s mind, there were two ways to deal with his situation: give in to despair and sleepwalk\nthrough the year, or grit his teeth and prove that he could conquer this punishment. Despite the fact\nthat he was clearly starting out as one of the least proficient students, he was determined to work\nharder than all the others. Book studying had never been a strength of his and so he was not surprised\nthat reading and writing Espenian proved to be a constant struggle, but he soon discovered that he\nwas much better at picking up on spoken language. Whenever he could, he sat in the campus food\ncourt, on public benches, or at bus stops, and eavesdropped on nearby conversations, sometimes\nechoing the words in his head, forming them silently in his mouth. He clung to the idea that the\nsooner he graduated, the sooner he would go home.\nOver the following months, when he was not in class or studying, he tried to make himself\nuseful to his hosts. His time spent working at the furniture store in Marenia had made him handy with\ntools and chores; he fixed a sagging door, caulked drafty windows, and turned some discarded boards"

His time spent working at the furniture store in Marenia had made him handy with\ntools and chores; he fixed a sagging door, caulked drafty windows, and turned some discarded boards\ninto a shoe rack. He accompanied the Hians on errands and carried things.\n“We should be paying you to stay with us,” Mrs. Hian exclaimed. “We’ve had students room\nwith us before, but most of them want to explore, to go out and enjoy themselves in the city. You\nwork too hard.”\nTheir neighborhood, Anden discovered, was like a quilt—there were several distinct cultural\nenclaves side by side within it. Many families of Kekonese descent lived in the dozen square blocks\naround the Hians’ row house, but Anden could cross a road and find himself in an area that was\nentirely Tuni, where the residents shouted out to their children in that guttural language, and the eye-\nwatering smoke of clay-pot cooking rose from portable hearths on every front stoop. The rest of the\nbroader Southtrap district, which extended west to Lochwood and east to Quince, was lower- and\nworking-class Espenian.\nOne afternoon, Anden missed his bus, and as it was a warm spring day by Port Massy standards,\nhe decided to walk back to the Hians’ home. It took him nearly two hours, but he was proud to be\nmaking his way alone in this foreign city and gaining a better understanding of its layout. Along the\nway, he grew thirsty and stopped into a convenience store on the corner to buy a soda and bag of nuts.\nHe counted out the copper Espenian coins on the countertop. The shop owner, a large man with a\nmustache, said something cheerful that Anden took to be a pleasantry. As he was still not confident in\nanything that came out of his mouth, Anden merely nodded and smiled. This was a recurring problem\n—on first appearance, he could pass for Espenian, and it was invariably awkward and embarrassing\nwhen strangers tried to speak to him.\nAs he made his way toward the exit of the store, two men came in. They didn’t stop to browse\nfor merchandise, but went straight up to the counter and began speaking to the owner in an initially\ncordial tone that quickly turned rough and threatening. Anden paused at the threshold and turned back\nin time to see the shopkeeper open the register and nervously count out a stack of cash, which he\nhanded to one of the intruders. His eyes darted briefly toward Anden, as if hoping for a stranger’s\nassistance. Anden stood indecisive, one hand on the door. These were not his people; he did not know\nwhat was going on and did not want to get into a bad situation.\nThe amount of money surrendered was apparently insufficient because more sharp words were\ndelivered. One man grabbed the two nearest store fixtures and pulled them forward, spilling candy\nbars and sunglasses across the floor. The store owner let out an angry shout of protest. The second\nman seized him by the hair and banged the owner’s forehead into the top of the cash register with a\npainful-sounding clang, then shoved him violently backward. The shopkeeper crashed out of sight.\nHis two assailants left; Anden backed out of the way as they pushed past him. One of them paused"

One of them paused\nlong enough to snarl directly in Anden’s face, “What’re you looking at?”—it was the first time Anden\nso clearly understood something said in Espenian—but the other man hurried them both out the door,\nwhich jangled shut behind them.\nAnden’s pulse was galloping. He felt as if he should’ve done something, but he wasn’t sure\nwhat. He knew instinctively that it would’ve been a bad idea to get in the way of the two men, but he\ndidn’t know what a person was supposed to do here in Espenia when he witnessed trouble. In\nJanloon, he would’ve run out and reported the incident to a Finger in the clan, or a Fist if he could\nfind one.\nThe shopkeeper groaned and began pulling himself to his feet behind the counter. He did not\nseem badly hurt, and Anden, with a distinct sense of shame but a desire not to have to interact with\nthe unfortunate man further, pushed through the exit and escaped down the street.\nMr. and Mrs. Hian were distressed by how late he was and berated him for not phoning them to\nbe picked up. They became more upset when he explained how he’d walked home and what had\nhappened along the way. “Those men are in the Crews. They work for Boss Kromner,” Mrs. Hian\nexclaimed. “Don’t go there from now on!”\nAnden wasn’t bothered by the idea of certain parts of the city being off limits; in fact, it was\noddly reassuring to realize that there were clans and territories in Port Massy, just as there were in\nJanloon. With that in mind, he suspected that the shopkeeper had been a Lantern Man of sorts, and the\ntwo men had been sent to collect on delinquent tribute payments. He was glad he had not foolishly\ninterfered in an unknown clan’s business, but he was troubled by the situation because it struck him as\nremarkably coarse. In Kekon, it was rare for Green Bones to treat even the most troublesome Lantern\nMan so badly. The clans were enmeshed in every aspect of society; failing to pay reasonable tribute\nmeant losing the clan’s patronage, which would make life difficult in a myriad of ways. An unreliable\nLantern Man might find it hard to open a bank account, buy a house, or put his children in school.\nThere was no need to threaten or injure him.\nAnden thought about this as he tucked into Mrs. Hian’s gingery fish soup. “Why doesn’t the\nstore owner go to this Kromner and ask for some lenience?” he asked. He was certain that a not-\ninsignificant percentage of his cousin Shae’s job as Weather Man was negotiating accommodations\nwith Lantern Men, albeit at a higher level than that of corner store owners.\nMr. Hian chuckled, then turned serious once he realized that Anden was not joking.

Mr. Hian put down the paper and pointed to a black-and-\nwhite photograph of a heavyset Espenian man in a dark suit and tie, getting out of a black ZT Toro\nwith a woman in a long white fur coat. Anden was still not good at reading Espenian; the headline had\nsomething to do with police corruption.\nMr. Hian said, “This Blaise Kromner—he’s a bad man. A criminal. He’s known to sell drugs and\nto deal in women. His people do all the work so he is never caught, but he has a nice car, nice clothes,\nand is always going to parties and being photographed. Do you think he cares about the store owner,\nor even knows who he is?” Mr. Hian folded the newspaper up and put it back in the bin. “Anden-se,\nthe Crews aren’t like clans. All they care about is money. They never give, they only take. That store\nowner pays and pays, but gets nothing.”\nAnden received another shocking cultural education two weeks later, this time much closer to home.\nHe was returning to the house in the evening, carrying a bag of groceries he’d gotten for the Hians,\nwhen he heard shouting from one of the open windows across the street.\nThis was not uncommon; there was a Kekonese couple living there that fought like animals all\nthe time, sometimes screaming at each other late into the night. The man’s voice could be heard\nclearly. “I ought to kill you, you fucking cunt!” There was a crash, more shouting from both parties,\nthen abruptly, the woman burst from the front door in her nightclothes and ran, it seemed to Anden,\nstraight into traffic.\nAnden envisioned her being smashed like a loose goat on the freeway and flying off the hood of\nan oncoming car. A bicycle swerved out of the way and the young man riding it leapt off with a\nstartled curse. Anden dropped his bag of groceries and started forward even though he knew in that\ninstant that there was no way for him to do anything in time.\nThe young man who’d been riding the bicycle lunged and grabbed the distraught woman. In a\nburst of Strength and Lightness, he dragged her back to the sidewalk. Cars shot past a hand’s breadth\naway, honking loudly. The woman’s astounded husband—shirtless, drunk, and enraged—ran up\nyelling unintelligibly. He staggered as the bicyclist turned and threw a Deflection that hit him at the\nknees. As he stumbled forward again, another Deflection caught him in the midriff and he sat down\nhard, as if he’d been clotheslined at the waist.\nThe wife ran sobbing into a neighbor’s house down the street, not even bothering to thank her\ndefender. After a minute, the husband got to his feet and retreated back to the house, muttering curses\nbut keeping his murderous glare averted.\nAnden found his voice. “You’re a Green Bone,” he shouted in Kekonese.\nThe young man across the street looked over, pushing the disheveled hair off his forehead as if to"

He couldn’t see any jade worn on the man’s\nbody, but it must be there. The Green Bone swung his leg over his scuffed bicycle and glanced back\nat Anden, still standing on the sidewalk, groceries spilled behind him.\n“You didn’t think there was anywhere else in the world where people have jade?” The man\nwaved mockingly and pedaled off, calves bunching, ropey shoulders leaning over the handlebars.\nAnden stared after him until he was out of sight.\nPossibly, he thought, not everything in Espenia was strange and unbearable.\nCHAPTER\n12\nNecessary Actions\nT\nhe meeting between the Pillars of the Mountain and No Peak clans was held in the town of Gohei,\nroughly seventy-five kilometers from the heart of Janloon. The last time Kaul Hilo and Ayt Mada\nfaced each other in person had been a year ago in Wisdom Hall, in a negotiation that had spanned the\ncourse of several days under the jurisdiction of a mediation committee arranged by the Royal\nCouncil. Unlike that event, which had been a public performance that both clans knew would not\nresult in any real agreement, the event in Gohei was known only to a handful of Green Bones in the\ntop leadership of both clans. Gohei was controlled by the minor Black Tail clan, which had no\ntributary status or formal allegiance with either the Mountain or No Peak, so the proceedings would\ntake place on neutral ground. The meeting would happen over the course of a single afternoon. Each\nclan paid for the presence of two senior penitents from the Temple of Divine Return. All these details\nwere arranged between the Weather Men and signaled that the discussions would be taken seriously.\nHilo, Shae, Kehn, and a small group of their closest aides—Tar, Woon, and Juen—arrived in\nGohei shortly after noon and were met at the house of the Black Tail clan’s Pillar. Durn Soshunuro,\nhis wife, and three of his four children greeted the visitors with great respect. The only one not\npresent was Durn’s oldest son, who was waiting somewhere away from the premises—an\nunderstandable precaution that no one would begrudge the family for, given the slim but dangerous\npossibility of the negotiations breaking down in dramatic fashion and the hosts being blamed or\ncaught in the center. Durn’s uncle had been a wartime comrade of Ayt Yugontin and Kaul Seningtun\nbut had afterward eschewed living in the big city, preferring to reside in the countryside. With Ayt’s\nand Kaul’s blessings, he formed his own small clan and took jurisdiction over Gohei, which at the\ntime was a farming community that also acted as a trading post with the Abukei tribes and a stopping\npoint for travelers on the way to Janloon.\nFollowing Janloon’s decades of expansion, Gohei had since become more of a far-flung suburb"

Even it if was only a matter of time before Black Tail\nbecame a tributary entity, Durn was a wise enough Pillar to want that transition to occur peacefully.\nHe had seen what bloodshed the big clans were capable of and wanted to avoid his family—only half\nof whom even wore jade—ever being on the receiving end. So he put his entire home at the disposal\nof the visitors and arranged the large sunroom to be the meeting place, with the proper number of\nchairs in their positions and a jug of cold citrus tea and glasses already set in the center of the table.\nTwo of the penitents stood in the corners of the room and the other two were situated in the front and\nback halls so there was nowhere on the main floor not within spiritual purview. Hilo thanked Durn\ngraciously and Woon discreetly handed Durn’s wife a green envelope in consideration for the trouble\nthey had gone to.\nIt was a good thing that Hilo had already spoken at length with Shae and Kehn and had mentally\nprepared for the meeting during the car ride, because Ayt Mada and her people arrived only a few\nminutes later. When they entered the room, the number of jade auras crowding Hilo’s mind seemed to\ndim the sunlight pouring in from the large windows. It was the first time he’d gotten a close look at\nNau Suen, the new Horn of the Mountain, and his eyes and Perception lingered a little longer on the\nman who’d stepped in to replace Gont Asch. Nau was tall and lean, and though he was in his early\nfifties, he looked like the sort of person who would get up at sunrise to run five kilometers before\nbreakfast. Perhaps because of his prior career as an instructor at Wie Lon Temple School, Nau carried\nhis jade stacked on his wrists, on leather bands similar to the sort used by students. An unblinking\ngaze and cool, probing jade aura suggested that very little escaped his notice.\nAyt Mada appeared unchanged and straightforward in appearance, wearing a pair of blue slacks\nand a white blouse, but commanding in the intensity of her assured stare and dense aura. “Kaul-jen,”\nshe said, and seated herself comfortably in one of the two chairs pulled up close to the table.\nWordlessly, Hilo sat down in the seat across from her. The Horns and the Weather Men took their\nseats slightly behind their Pillars, and the remaining Green Bones stood watchfully against the walls.\nDurn and his wife came in with plates of light snacking foods—sliced fruit, small nut paste buns,\nsalty dried meat cakes—and poured cool tea into glasses. Durn’s youngest child, a girl of about eight,\nfollowed close behind her parents. With the nodded permission of the Pillars, Durn made a point of\nalso pouring his daughter a glass of tea and letting her help herself to the snacks, so there was no\nsuspicion of anything wrong with the food.

So be it if Ayt viewed him a simple thug; he saw no reason to dissuade her of the\nopinion. He leaned back in his chair and popped an entire nut paste bun into his mouth, taking his\ntime to chew and swallow. “We’re here because you expected to be in control of the city by now, and\nfor everyone with the name of Kaul to be feeding worms, but that hasn’t happened.” He spread his\nhands and gave her a cold smile. “Talk is for when violence fails.”\nThe Pillar of the Mountain said, with a flash of impatience, “If one of us could’ve won this war\nwith moon blades, Kaul-jen, we’d have already done so.

There’s no money entering the national coffers from jade exports.\nThe Oortokon conflict will become a contest between the major powers, who’re greedily eyeing\nKekon’s inactive jade mines for their military forces. If we continue in this way, we’ll undermine the\nnational government, drain the jade stores of both our clans, lose the support of the people, and make\nour nation a vulnerable target for foreigners. The public knows this, the Royal Council knows it, the\nsmugglers like Zapunyo know it. So now it is up to us to avert this disaster.”\nHilo regarded the other Pillar shrewdly. “If the KJA starts up again, it has to be with all the new\nrules in place. All the jade that’s mined goes through the official body so there’s no theft on anyone’s\npart.” His lips curled slightly. “I should say, no further theft. You haven’t repaid the Kekon Treasury\nfor the ‘financial discrepancies’ that the audit turned up last year.”\nAyt was not ruffled. “Let’s not open those books again, Kaul-jen. No one cares about balance\nsheets from three years ago. You drop the subject of the alleged misappropriations, and we’ll take a\nlower share of KJA allocations for the next three years. Our Weather Men can figure out the exact\npercentages in order to satisfy the board of directors.”\nHilo shrugged; he had never expected that the Mountain would account for the jade it had\nalready stolen, so this was as far as he figured Ayt would go. “Fine. So that’s the KJA. As for the\nsmuggling: Ti Pasuiga has crooks working in the city and all over the country. Zapunyo doesn’t care\nabout clan territorial borders and neither will the foreigners. A truce means both of us have to agree to\ntake an equal part in going after the black market—stamping out the rockfish and the shine dealers\nand the foreign gangsters that’ve sprung up like weeds while we were busy fighting each other. If one\nside puts in more effort, it would be too easy for the other to take advantage and move in on"

If one\nside puts in more effort, it would be too easy for the other to take advantage and move in on\nundefended territories.”\nAyt inclined her head. “My Horn will cooperate with yours to make sure we’re jointly\ncommitted in our efforts against smuggling. We agree it has to be eliminated. We won’t move on any\nof your territories, so long as the currently disputed districts are fairly divided.”\n“Fairly divided,” Hilo repeated scornfully. There was no division that would satisfy both sides;\nthree days in Wisdom Hall last year had made that abundantly clear. No matter which parts of the city\nwere conceded to which clan, one could argue endlessly that the split was incorrect and should be\ndone another way. The thought of giving up anything to the Mountain made Hilo furious, but he knew\nthere was no way to deal with it except quickly and bluntly. “That depends on whether we’re talking\nabout area or value.”\n“Value,” said Ayt.\nHilo grimaced; he could’ve guessed as much. He turned over his shoulder to consult briefly with\nShae, then turned back to Ayt. “We keep Poor Man’s Road and the rest of the Armpit.” The city’s\nlargest gambling houses were not merely the clan’s most profitable and symbolic conquest, they were\na strategic complement to No Peak’s companies in the hospitality sector.\n“Then we reclaim Spearpoint south of Patriot Street and take Sogen,” Ayt answered smoothly\nand at once, having clearly anticipated her rival’s priorities.\n“Three-quarters of Sogen,” Hilo countered. “Everything west of Twentieth Street.” That would\npreserve a No Peak zone on both sides of Haino Boulevard and create a buffer for Old Town. It was\nstill a major concession, especially since Tar and his men had fought so hard to win that district last\nyear. Behind him, Hilo could Perceive his Pillarman’s unhappiness, but they’d come in expecting to\nlose something. Hilo said, “Both of our Weather Men will have to do the math and agree.”\n“Of course,” Ayt said.\nHilo said, “And you hand over Yun Dorupon.”\n“He’s living unguarded in the town of Opia,” Ayt said, without blinking an eye, as if she were\ntelling him the time of day. “You can have your spies confirm.” Hilo felt Shae’s aura shift slightly, but\nhe himself did not react.\n“One last thing,” Hilo said. “My cousin Anden. You know he isn’t wearing jade. So long as\nthat’s the case, no matter where he is, no one from the Mountain goes anywhere near him. He’s\nstudying abroad now, but the world’s getting to be a smaller place every day. Anything suspicious\nhappens to him, I’m going to blame the people in this room. We shouldn’t have to spell out aisho as if\nit’s for preschoolers, but that’s the way things seem to be these days.”\nAyt seemed amused. “So long as I’m Pillar and Emery Anden remains jadeless, we won’t\ninterfere with him, or take vengeance for the death of Gont Asch.” Ayt’s expression was icy, but the\ncorner of her mouth twitched upward. “Do we have an agreement, Kaul Hiloshudon?”"

        "text": "corner of her mouth twitched upward. “Do we have an agreement, Kaul Hiloshudon?”\nHilo had never imagined he would be in this position. Dead, yes, he had imagined that countless\ntimes—but not this, sitting within arm’s reach of his enemy and calmly negotiating for peace. He was\nnot a true Deitist believer in the afterlife, but he imagined the spirits of everyone who had died on the\nclan’s behalf hovering accusingly behind him: his brother Lan, his many Fists—Satto, Goun, Lott, to\nname just a few—and dozens of Fingers who’d sworn their loyalty to him, most of them young\nwarriors cut down in the prime of their lives.\nFor a second, Hilo felt almost physically sick with self-loathing. How had Shae convinced him\nto agree to this? She was always pushing him to make calculated, sensible decisions—but sensible\nwas not always right. He knew Ayt could Perceive the flare of emotion in his jade aura, just as he\ncould sense easily enough that behind her composed expression, her hatred for him had not\ndiminished in the least. She was acting as much out of necessity as he was.\n“Yes,” Hilo said. “Under Heaven and on jade.”\n“Under Heaven and on jade,” Ayt agreed, repeating the words, lifted in shorthand from the\ntraditional closing of the longer Green Bone oaths. They sealed the decisions reached in the meeting,\nmaking them the official word of the Pillar, the will of the clan. With the intent of the pact in place, it\nwould be up to the clans’ Weather Men to negotiate all the specific details.\nAyt turned slightly over her shoulder to address her Horn and her Weather Man. “Before we go,\nI’d like to speak to Kaul Hilo-jen alone for a few minutes,” she said. Ayt turned back around to face\nHilo, her expression even more inscrutable than usual. “As one Pillar to another.”\nNau Suen and Ree Tura rose from their seats and left the room, taking their aides with them.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Hilo glanced at Kehn and Shae and nodded that they were to leave as\nwell. Both their jade auras buzzed warily at the unusual request, but they stood and exited, the rest of\nthe No Peak men following. None of the Green Bones went far; Hilo could Perceive them all standing\njust outside, ready to return at a second’s notice from their Pillars.\nAyt’s demeanor shifted, turned almost casual. She leaned onto the table with one elbow and\nplaced a few slices of fruit and a meat cake onto a small plate, the sleeve of her blouse falling to her\nelbow and revealing silver-mounted coils of jade stones. “Let’s speak frankly, Kaul-jen,” she said.\n“You don’t want to be Pillar. You’re not suited to the role like your grandfather and your brother.”\nHilo said in a very cold voice, “I haven’t forgotten you’re the reason I’m in this job.”\n“And I haven’t forgotten that you massacred dozens of my Green Bones and murdered Gont\nAsch. We both used whatever methods and ruses we deemed necessary in a time of war. Unexpected\nlosses were to be expected.” Ayt stood up, taking her plate with her to the window and opening the"

Unexpected\nlosses were to be expected.” Ayt stood up, taking her plate with her to the window and opening the\nshade enough to look out at the countryside: low green hills cut into neat terraces, laborers working in\nthe distance, a muddy pickup truck passing an oxcart on the road behind Durn’s property. Slowly, Ayt\nate the food on her plate and turned around, the light from the window framing her, shadowing her\nface. “Kaul Lan was born and trained to be the Pillar; you were not. Do you really believe you can\nsucceed at diplomacy, at business, at anything where you don’t have a talon knife in your hand?\n“Set aside blind vengeance and find it in yourself to think dispassionately for a minute, if you’re\ncapable of doing so. I didn’t order your brother’s death, and I’d hand his killers over to you if I knew\nwho and where they were.” Her voice lowered and for the first time that Hilo could remember, Ayt\nspoke to him in a tone approaching reasonableness. “A merger between our clans is still possible. It\nwould be better for everyone: no more fighting in the city, no more vying for every bit of business and\npolitical influence. Together, Green Bones could wipe out smuggling, control the jade and shine trade,\nand present an unassailable force against encroaching foreigners.”\nAyt stepped away from the window. “There are two things even your enemies say about you,\nKaul-jen: You always keep your promises, and you’re a natural Horn. Nau Suen is too old to be Horn\nof the Mountain for more than a few years. You can serve both yourself and the country: Pledge to\nend the blood feud and join our clans, and you’ll return to your rightful place, ruling the streets,\nkeeping jade out of the hands of criminals and smugglers, being the Green Bone you’re good at\nbeing, the sort that leaves a trail of blood in his wake, like you did on Tialuhiya.”\nHilo sat back and tilted his head slightly to one side. “You’re an unusual sort of person, Ayt-jen,”\nhe said at last. “I wonder what it’s like, to think like a machine and not care about anyone.”\nAyt’s manner hardened instantly at Hilo’s words. Her thick jade aura rolled like a wave. She did\nnot raise her voice, but it emerged slow and deadly. “Don’t presume you know me, Kaul Hilo.”\nHilo rose from his seat in one smooth motion and stalked forward. “I know a few things about\nyou. You whispered the name of your own brother. You colluded with a traitor in my clan and seeded\ncriminals in No Peak territory. You stole and sold jade behind our backs. You’re the reason Lan’s\ndead. You tried to have me assassinated, and you tried to convince my own sister to kill me. Are those\nenough things, Ayt-jen?” He glanced at the penitents standing unmoved in the corners of the rooms,\nas if suggesting they ought to be listening carefully to his accounting of her sins. Each of Hilo’s\nwords came out as distinct as a slowly drawn knife cut. “I will never swear oaths to you.”"

Each of Hilo’s\nwords came out as distinct as a slowly drawn knife cut. “I will never swear oaths to you.”\nAyt’s expression simmered with a scorn that suggested she was fed up with predictable reactions.\n“I’m extending a hand instead of a blade. Refuse it, and it won’t happen again.”\n“So we understand each other,” Hilo said. “It’s obvious you’re still dreaming of one-clan rule in\nKekon, which means that truce or no truce, you’re going to have to kill me eventually.” Hilo\nshrugged, but there was nothing nonchalant about the motion. “If I don’t get to you first.”\nAyt’s mouth moved imperceptibly, but her powerful aura bathed Hilo in the furnace heat of a\nmenace as unforgiving as a wildfire. “I’ve tried enough times to reason with the stubborn Kaul\nbloodline.” She adjusted one of the coils of jade on her arm. “Ree Tura will work with your Weather\nMan to arrange how we announce the agreement between the clans to the Royal Council and the\npublic. I’m sure the people of Kekon will be relieved and pleased by our change of heart.” The Pillar\nof the Mountain strode past him, set the small plate down on the table, and left the room.\nCHAPTER\n13\nAfter the Show\nA\nformal press conference was held two weeks later, the morning after Boat Day, on neutral ground\nin the Monument District. The grand ballroom of the historic General Star Hotel had hosted foreign\nheads of state, government officials, diplomats, and dignitaries of all stripes, but Hilo doubted it had\never seen two clan Pillars and this many Green Bones within its four walls. Through the expanse of\nwindows behind the raised platform, one could see the west side of Wisdom Hall, and beyond a row\nof blossoming trees, the tiered roof of the Triumphal Palace. No one in attendance, including the\njournalists sitting in the front rows of chairs, could fail to grasp the significance: The announcements\nbeing made today were as consequential to the country as anything that came from the official\ngovernment.\nThe show was not just for the press and the public, but for the clans themselves. Hundreds of\nhigh-rank members of the No Peak clan—Lantern Men, Luckbringers, Fists—occupied the left side\nof the room. Mountain clan loyalists dominated the right side. A dozen penitents in long green robes\nstood along the walls and in the corners as peace insurance.\nKaul Hilo and Ayt Mada sat side by side at the raised table. A microphone had been placed in\nfront of each of them. Shae and Kehn sat at a slightly recessed table next to Hilo; Ree Tura and Nau\nSuen mirrored them on Ayt’s side. The highest leadership of the two largest clans in Kekon, that for\nnearly two years had striven to destroy each other, were seated together to face the Kekonese people\nand to declare peace.\nBoth sides had agreed to have Toh Kita, a well-known news anchor from Kekon National\nBroadcasting, moderate the press conference.

Then Hilo and Ayt took turns reading aloud the\njoint statement that laid out the terms of the truce: new territorial jurisdictions, resumption of mining\nactivities under the reformed auspices of the Kekon Jade Alliance, cooperation to combat the\nescalating problems of shine dealing and jade smuggling. Both Pillars finished by reiterating their\nduty and commitment not only to the constituents of their clans but to the nation.\nA limited number of prescreened questions from the press were submitted and read out to the\nroom by Toh. Ayt was asked what measures she would take within her clan to ensure that “financial\noversights” would not occur again. The Pillar of the Mountain replied that she took the concerns of\nthe Royal Council and the public very seriously. Ree Tura had resigned from his post and a new\nWeather Man would be appointed within the month. Hilo was unsurprised at this; Ree himself did not\nreact in the slightest. He was near retirement anyway, and had no doubt expected to figuratively fall\non his sword for the clan.\nA question was posed to Hilo. “Kaul-jen, with today’s agreement, are you hereby declaring that\nyou will no longer seek personal vengeance for the death of your brother?”\n“There’s been death on both sides,” Hilo answered. “My grief isn’t any less, but I know that\nvengeance is not what my brother or my grandfather—let the gods recognize them—would want the\nclan to be focused on. We have to move on.”\nIt was not, strictly, an answer to the question, and this was noticed by the Fists in the room who\nknew Hilo well. But Shae and her people had prepared extensively for this event, and it was perhaps a\nsign of experience gained on both their parts that the Pillar was staying so unerringly on script.\nThe final question asked if the Pillars had anything to say about the current crisis in Oortoko and\nwhether they felt the geopolitical tension between Espenia and Ygutan put Kekon in danger. “The\ninterference of foreign powers in Shotar is deeply concerning,” Ayt said. “Although we stand by our\nlong alliance with the Republic of Espenia, we must make it clear that we will not be taken advantage\nof by any nation.”\n“Kekon is an island surrounded by bigger countries, and we’re the only place in the world with\njade,” Hilo said. “We’ve always been in danger. But we’ve always had Green Bones.”\nOn the face of it, the Pillars sounded very much in accord as Toh brought the press conference to\na conclusion. Onstage and in view of all the spectators and cameras, Kaul Hilo and Ayt Mada stood at\nthe same time and, facing each other, touched clasped hands to their foreheads, saluting each other\nwith all respect. As Hilo met the other Pillar’s steady stare, a moment of almost amiable\ncongratulations passed between them: They’d both played their parts well. Their jade auras burned\nagainst each other like hot coals and molten steel.\nTar and Woon were waiting to escort them away from the stage.

Woon put a steady hand on\nShae’s back and guided her toward the rear exit where their cars were waiting, but Hilo paused along\nthe way to speak to Chancellor Son Tomarho. The corpulent politician looked pale and overworked\nthese days; he appeared to have gained even more weight and he wheezed a little as he caught up to\nthe Pillar. Son’s time as head of the Royal Council had been plagued by clan violence, economic\nconcerns, and now international military escalation and foreign pressure. While ostensibly\nrepresenting the interests of the common people, the overwhelming majority of councilmen were\naffiliated with one of the major clans; for two years, open war between No Peak and the Mountain\nhad bred a tense and factional political environment in which the tide of political fortune might be\nswayed by the outcome of street battles between Green Bones. Trying to lead such a divided political\nbody was surely not good for one’s health. Son had less than two years left in his six-year term, and\nHilo suspected the man was already looking forward to leaving office.\n“Chancellor,” Hilo said, forcing a smile and putting a hand on the man’s large shoulder. “Peace\nbetween the clans, like you wanted. And both of us still alive.”\nSon cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Ah, yes, well. It’s true that was not always a foregone\nconclusion. I speak gladly for the Royal Council in commending you and your Weather Man on this\nachievement; the entire country is thankful and relieved.” Son touched his hands to his forehead and\nbent into a salute. “A great day, Kaul-jen.”\n“What a miserable day, to end a miserable month,” Hilo grumbled after dinner. He spooned coconut\nrice custard into small bowls and passed them down the table as Kyanla cleared away the used plates.\n“At least I got Teije back.”\n“An accomplishment that was surely worth getting yourself and everyone in No Peak banned for\nlife from the Uwiwa Islands,” Shae said drily. “Zapunyo’s made sure that scenes of dead Uwiwan\npolicemen are all over his country’s news programs and some international ones.”\n“Shae,” Hilo admonished, glancing at their mother.\nTo everyone’s surprise, Kaul Wan Ria spoke up and said, “Everyone knows the Uwiwans are all\ncrooks; even their police are crooks. To think what might’ve happened to poor Mrs. Teije’s son if you\nhadn’t rescued him. You saved your auntie’s life, Hilo-se; she would’ve died of a broken heart if her\nson had come to harm, and so far away from home. I hope he learns his lesson and stays in Kekon\nfrom now on.” She began to push back from the table.\nWen got up to help her. “Don’t you want dessert, Ma?” she asked.\n“No, you should eat it. You need it for the baby.”\nAfter dinner was a time for the Green Bones in the family to discuss clan issues. Hilo recalled\nthat as a child, he would be shooed away to play, while Grandda, Doru, and their inner circle\nremained in the dining room, smoking and drinking hoji, and his mother retired to her room to read or\nwatch television."

Full family dinners were rare in the Kaul home these days. “Everything okay with the\nguesthouse? It’ll be a lot nicer once we fix it up; we’re going to put in new floors and appliances. I\nknow you like it in Marenia, but you should live closer once the baby arrives.” Since Lan’s death, it\nseemed to Hilo that his mother had aged and shrunken; he’d hired help to take care of the family’s\nbeach house, bring her groceries, and check in on her, but it would be safer to have her behind estate\nwalls, and a grandchild might give her some purpose.\nHis mother patted him on the arm. Hilo didn’t press his argument. She might be reluctant to give\nup the peaceful solitude she’d grown used to on the coast, but he was her eldest son now, and she was\nsure to obey him; he simply needed to be gentle about it.\nOnce his mother had departed, Hilo sat back down and ate his dessert, giving Shae another\nremonstrative look for her deliberate tactlessness. Securing the peace agreement between the clans\nhad been a significant public victory for the Weather Man’s office; Hilo knew his sister had been\nworking long hours for weeks, spearheading the detailed negotiations. But that didn’t excuse her\ntalking down to him, in front of his own men and his wife, no less.\n“You want to know what Ayt Mada said to me in Gohei?” Hilo looked around the table before\nsettling his gaze back on Shae. “She told me to give up now. To kneel and take oaths to the Mountain,\nbecause I’m not Grandda, and I’m not Lan, so No Peak’s fucked.”\n“Hilo-jen,” Kehn said, scowling, “she’s trying to make you doubt yourself. Just because you’re\nnot the Torch, or because you’re different from Lan-jen—let the gods recognize them—doesn’t mean\nyou can’t be a strong Pillar, or an even better one. For myself, I can’t be the Horn that you were; I can\nonly be my own sort.” Everyone looked at Kehn, a little surprised by his honesty and thoughtfulness.\n“I wouldn’t have made you Horn if I didn’t think you could do a good job,” Hilo said. “So\nthere’s a difference. I never had either Grandda’s or Lan’s blessing.”\nWen placed her hand on Hilo’s leg. “You have us.”\nHilo nodded. “That’s true, and maybe that’s the one thing I have that Ayt doesn’t. We’re all\nfamily at this table, so I’m not ashamed to admit that I need the help of every one of you. For my part,\nI promise to listen to what you have to say, even when I don’t agree or if I make a different decision.\nAnd when I do, it’s the word of the Pillar, and you have to respect that.” This last part was directed at\nhis Weather Man, who glanced at him sideways with an appropriate amount of grudging guilt for the\nsarcastic way she’d spoken earlier."

I want you to make it clear all the way down the ranks. We’ll hold to the borders\nwe’ve agreed to. No more raids or attacks on their territory, no more taking Mountain blood or jade\nwithout family approval.” Gods in Heaven, I sound just like Lan, Hilo thought unhappily.\n“We’ll stick to our part of the bargain,” Hilo said, in response to Tar’s skeptical face, “because\nwe need the Mountain to do their part in going after the smuggling. One clan can’t protect the\ncountry’s mine sites and coastline. So we have to do this; we have to make peace for now. Because\nit’s obvious from what happened on Tialuhiya that Zapunyo has every intention of reaching into\nKekon, and that uwie midget is ambitious enough to think he can take on Green Bones. He’ll hide\ninside his mansion and use others—cops, crooks, addicts, anyone he can pay or intimidate—to do his\nwork. That means he’ll have rats all over Janloon, if he doesn’t already.”\n“We’ve got rats of our own,” Tar reminded the Pillar.\n“Not enough of them.” Hilo directed his words to both of the Maik brothers. “We need White\nRats wherever our enemies are, and that’s not just on the streets here in Janloon. We have to be\nwatching every which way for the Mountain’s next move—Ayt will try something clever, come after\nus in some way we don’t expect and that doesn’t make her look bad for sitting next to me, smiling on\ncamera. And we need people we trust or own in the Uwiwa Islands, close to or inside Ti Pasuiga,\nfeeding us information about Zapunyo’s business so we can take it apart.”\nThe Maik brothers nodded. Shae said, “Zapunyo’s hardly the only one who’s interested in the\ncountry’s jade mines. And some of the other interested parties have armies. We ought to be more\nworried about the Ygutanians and the Espenians than about Zapunyo.”\nKehn leaned his crossed arms on the table. “The Ygutanians wouldn’t dare come after Kekon,\nnot with the Espenians camped out on Euman Island.”\n“That’s not stopping them from buying jade off the black market from dealers like Zapunyo, or\nunder the table from Ayt Mada, who’s already established shine factories inside Ygutan to support her\nsecret contracts,” Shae pointed out. “The Espenians think of Kekon as their jade source, and it’ll be a\nproblem for us if they decide their wartime supplier isn’t secure or reliable enough.”\n“The Espenians are full of shit,” Tar exclaimed. “They can’t handle the jade they already have.\nLook at what’s going on over there.

Even the ROE\nspecial ops guys aren’t allowed to wear it for more than three years of service, because of what being\naddicted to shine does to you—fucks you up, gives you cancer or something, I don’t know. There’s\nmore jade around this dinner table than in one of their platoons.” Tar began to pull out a cigarette, but\nHilo took it from him. He wanted to have one too, but Wen said smoky air wasn’t good for the baby.\nHe poured Tar a glass of hoji instead.\n“Anyway,” Tar said, grudgingly accepting the drink, “if those thin bloods tried to occupy Kekon,\nthey’d never hold it. It’d be too costly for them, and the spennies are all about money.”\n“They’re our largest trading partner and military ally,” Shae said. “If we intend to grow the\nbusiness side of the clan, we need access to that market. There’re ways they can pressure or control us\nwithout resorting to invasion. They’re already trying.”\n“Then it’s a good thing I have a Weather Man who speaks Espenian and stays on top of it,” Hilo\nsaid. “The Espenians can be placated or bought, like what you did last year.”\nShae snorted. “You make it sound so simple.” To Hilo’s amusement, she and Wen exchanged a\nglance that might’ve been commiseration. “That’s what I get for being the Weather Man at a family\ndinner table full of former Fists.”\n“Come on, Shae, don’t be like that.” Hilo prodded her arm. “You could balance things, bring\nsomeone into the family from the Ship Street side of the clan. I’m sure Ma would like it if you\nbrought Woon Papi home for dinner. He comes from a good Green Bone family, doesn’t he? And with\nbusiness sense too.”\nTo Hilo’s delight, his sister blinked. Color began to rise in her face. “Woon-jen is the Weather\nMan’s Shadow,” she said stiffly. “Our relationship is entirely professional.”\nHilo chuckled and the Maiks hid smiles. “I’m sure it is for you,” he agreed. “Ah, Shae, how can\nyou be so smart in some ways, and so dense in others? I’m guessing it’s because you’ve already got\nsomeone else in mind. Have any of the clan’s families succeeded in pitching an eligible son at you?”\nHe could tell that his wide, teasing grin was starting to embarrass and infuriate her, and it improved\nhis mood considerably—not because he wanted to get into a fight, but because it made him feel oddly\nnostalgic for their many childhood battles. Besides, she had acted so superior with him earlier.\nHilo stacked the empty dessert bowls. Kyanla came from the kitchen to clear them and brought\nout a pot of tea. As Wen poured for everyone at the table, Hilo leaned back in his chair. “Enough of\nthat fun stuff,” he said. “We made peace with the Mountain today, like I said.” The smirk vanished\nfrom Hilo’s face and he spoke in a voice of complete seriousness. “So when we make our move, we\ncan’t do it halfway. We can’t injure them and start another bloody war. We have to cut the tree down"

When we act, we have to be strong—in our\npeople, our businesses, everything. Ayt was plotting for years before she showed her hand. That was\ngood for her; she almost got what she wanted and she hurt us badly, but we’re still here and now it’s\nour turn. Everyone here is kin, so we all know what happened on that stage today was for show.”\nHilo paused and looked around the table. No one said anything. Their gazes remained on him\nand their jade auras hummed evenly and without surprise. “The Mountain has weaknesses we don’t\nknow about,” he said. “Otherwise, they would never have agreed to a truce. We have to find out what\nthose weaknesses are. Even if it takes time. Then we’ll plan how to kill Ayt Madashi and her\nfollowers and destroy her clan.”\nHilo awoke rested but vaguely anxious the following morning. The conversation at the dinner table\nlast night had tumbled about in his mind before he’d fallen asleep. Perhaps other people in Janloon\nwould go about more happily today, knowing the clans were officially at peace, but Hilo felt no\ndifferent. As Horn, he’d seen Fists duel for jade, pimps and drug dealers knife each other for the best\nstreet corners, dogs and vagrants fight over food. One thing he knew for certain was that stalemates\nand compromises always broke down. Lasting peace came from unequivocal victory.\nEven as he thought about how to eventually bring down the Mountain for good, he had no doubt\nthat on the other side of town, Ayt Mada was likewise scheming to do the same to him. He did not yet\nknow how to go about crippling the Mountain so thoroughly that he could be sure it would never\nagain threaten his family. It seemed an insurmountable task, one he wasn’t certain even his\ngrandfather or Lan would’ve known how to achieve, and yet No Peak’s ultimate survival depended on\nit entirely. On top of that, now there were other adversaries and threats for him to think about as well.\nToo many pieces—all of them shadowy, instead of out in the open.\nHe curled himself around Wen and wrapped his arms around her gently bulging belly. If he\nconcentrated, he could Perceive the tiny life inside her—a faint, rapid drumming, like the heartbeat of\na mouse nestled under his wife’s familiar energy. It delighted and aroused him, to think of Wen\ngrowing his child in her body. He began to fondle her, gently but a little impatiently, cupping her\nswelling breasts, rolling the dark nipples under his thumbs, running his hand along the curve of her\nhip and over her buttocks and between her legs. He pressed the heat of his erection between her\nthighs. Wen rolled over and smiled sleepily at him, squirming closer. He pulled her nightgown over\nher head, turned her onto her side, and made love to her, perhaps a little more carefully than he\nordinarily would, because of the baby, even though she said there was nothing to worry about.\nAfterward, as he lay on his back, considerably more relaxed, Wen said, “Maybe Tar’s right and"

For years, we’ve been happily\ntaking foreign money to build the country, but now for the first time the average person is realizing\nwhat it means for foreigners to have what’s always belonged to us.” She propped herself on her\nelbows next to him. “They’re starting to wonder if our decisions have put us in danger. Maybe by\ntrading our jade, we’ve lost our souls or angered the gods. When people are scared, they make bad\ndecisions.”\nHilo shifted onto his side to face her, puzzled. “Why do you always do this? When we were all\ntalking after dinner yesterday, you stayed quiet and didn’t say anything. Later, we’re lying in bed, and\nyou want to talk clan business. If you have things to say, why not say them at the time?”\nWen looked away and rested her chin on her folded forearms; to Hilo’s surprise, she looked a\nlittle hurt by his question. “It wasn’t my place; I’m not a Green Bone.”\n“You’re not like my ma, either, leaving as soon as the talk starts. You’re not a Green Bone, but\nyou’re my wife. Everyone here is family; you should just talk if you want.”\nWen was quiet for a moment. “I’d rather speak to you alone.” She turned to face him again, her\nhead pillowed on one bent arm. “When it’s just the two of us, I can say anything that’s on my mind. I\nknow you’ll listen even if you don’t agree. I talk to a lot of ordinary people: small business owners,\ncontractors, office workers, students.” Wen had turned a talent for interior design into a job consulting\nfor clan-affiliated properties, and she was taking classes at Janloon City College to further her career.\n“So I’m only telling you what I’m hearing out there.”\nHilo pulled her near and pressed his face against her chest. “When the baby comes, you’ll have a\nnew job to occupy you so you won’t have time to worry so much about mine.”\n“I’ll always worry,” Wen said. “Even though I know there’s no man greener than my husband.\nEvery time I see all this”—she ran her fingers down Hilo’s collarbone and chest, gently tracing each\njade stud—“no matter how proud I am, I think of the danger you’re in, of how many enemies we\nhave.”\n“I will never let any of them near you,” Hilo promised. “Or our children.”\nThey kissed and touched each other for a while longer, and just as Hilo was thinking he ought to\nget up because he had a thousand things to do, Wen spoke quietly. “Eyni replied to my letter. I wrote\nher a long message and mailed it right away. I gave her news about the whole family and asked her to\ncome visit with her boyfriend and son. I knew it would take time to get a letter to Stepenland and\nback, but still, she took over a month to reply and wrote only a few sentences.”\nHilo sat up with his back against the headboard.

Wen rarely sounded so aggrieved; she was\ngenerally of a warm and caring disposition, but when she was upset, she could be extremely stubborn\nand cagey about the specifics of her displeasure. He had to prod her to elaborate. “So? What did she\nsay?”\n“She thanked me for taking the time to write but told me not to contact her again.” Wen sat up\nbeside him, her eyes flashing with hurt. “Why would she say something like that? We’d met before.\nWe weren’t close friends when she was Lan’s wife, but only because we never had the chance to get\nto know each other. I can’t make sense of her rudeness.”\n“I told you, Eyni was always stuck-up like that.” He’d always considered his sister-in-law to be a\nshallow, selfish woman—someone who liked nice clothes, theater, wine, and the status of being a\nPillar’s wife but who didn’t fit into the Kaul family at a deeper level. He’d done his best to show\nrespect to his brother’s wife, but had gotten the distinct sense that she looked down on him, thought\nof him as an uncouth kid (which he supposed he had been), and she’d never made an effort to talk to\nhim. Lan must’ve appreciated her cultured intellect and pretty face, but Hilo had been unsurprised\nand secretly relieved when the marriage ended.\n“You have to write back to her this time,” Wen insisted. “If she won’t show me the courtesy of a\nproper response, she’ll at least have to acknowledge the Pillar of the clan.”\n“I thought we talked about this,” Hilo said, but seeing the determined look on his wife’s face, he\nrelented. “I don’t think it’ll make a difference, but all right.”\nWen nodded, satisfied, although obviously still vexed. “If she won’t make the effort to come\nhere, you should go see her in Stepenland. Even if it’s a long trip, it would be worth it.” At Hilo’s\ndoubtful expression, she said, “You always say yourself that meeting face-to-face is best.”\nCHAPTER\n14\nOld Warrior’s Mercy\nT\nhree days after the press conference, Shae took only Woon and Hami with her on a trip out of\nJanloon. They arrived in the village of Opia late in the afternoon. As was typical during rainy season,\na thick mist had rolled off the mountains, obscuring the canopy of trees overhead and reducing\nvisibility on the winding single-lane road that led into the township. Opia consisted of a few dozen\nwood and clay buildings resting at odd angles to each other, dug into tenacious positions on steep\nslopes. Chickens sat on the corners of low, corrugated aluminum roofs. A barefoot boy with a yellow\ndog stared at the three Green Bones as they stepped out of Shae’s red Cabriola LS; with a shout, he\nturned and ran out of sight down a narrow cobblestone path.\nWoon came and stood next to her. Shae glanced at him for a little longer than usual. Ever since\nHilo had teased her at the dinner table, she couldn’t help but wonder whether her brother was right,"

Ever since\nHilo had teased her at the dinner table, she couldn’t help but wonder whether her brother was right,\nwhether Woon had developed feelings for her that she’d failed to see or had dismissed as dutiful\nprotectiveness. It was strange to see her chief of staff out of business attire and wearing a moon blade\nat his waist; he didn’t look like his normal, Ship Street self. Perhaps, judging from the uncertain\nexpression in his eyes, he felt the same way looking at her.\nWoon had suggested bringing some of the Horn’s people with them, but Shae had declined. She\nfelt this was almost a personal errand, a responsibility of the Weather Man’s office. The two sides of\nthe clan depended on each other, but there was a sense of competition between them as well.\nThe boy with the dog must have spread word of their arrival, because the residents of the small\nhouses came to stand in their doorways. “Green Bones! Come see,” Shae heard the children\nwhispering excitedly. The men and women wore plain or checkered cotton shirts and watched with\nsilent, wary respect, touching their hands to their foreheads in salute as Shae and the two men passed.\nOpia seemed like a place from another time, or perhaps simply a place that time had carelessly\nbypassed in its relentless march. The thick fog that obscured even nearby features of the landscape\nmade it seem all the more remote and eerie. It was hard to believe they were only a ninety-minute\ndrive inland from the metropolis of Janloon.\nHami was turning his head from side to side, alert. With the pistol bulging under his leather\njacket and the sheathed talon knife strapped to his belt, Shae could easily imagine what her Master\nLuckbringer had looked like as a Fist prior to his corporate career. “Seems the Mountain was telling\nthe truth,” he said. “No other Green Bones anywhere nearby.”\nShae’s Perception told her the same thing; she stretched it this way and that through the subdued\nenergies of the townspeople until she found the one familiar jade aura she was searching for, lying\nstraight ahead in a brown, wooden slat house at the end of the street. There was something slightly\ndifferent about it, but she could not place her finger on what.\nShae walked up to the cabin and pushed the unlocked door, which swung open on rusty hinges.\nShe stepped into a small room lit by a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.\n“Uncle Doru,” she said.\nThe former Weather Man sat in a chair beside a square folding card table in the kitchen area. He\nwas huddled in a brown bathrobe worn over a sleeveless white undershirt and gray track pants. A girl\nof about thirteen, the daughter of a townsperson, Shae guessed, was bending over, pouring steaming\nwater into a foot bath. At Shae’s entry, she gave a start and dropped the towel she’d been carrying.\n“Shae-se,” Doru rasped. A smile cracked his lined face. “It’s good to see you.” He looked over\nher shoulder. “Ah, Hami-jen, and Woon-jen. This is much better than I expected.”\nShae turned to the girl. “Leave,” she ordered. The teenager looked to Doru uncertainly. He said,"

He said,\nfondly, “Yes, go back to your parents, Niya-se, and thank you for all your kindness to an old Green\nBone these past weeks. The watchful gods will surely shine favor on you and your family.”\nThe girl set down the empty water bucket and hurried out of the small house, her eyes at her feet\nthe entire time. Shae watched her go. The knobs of the girl’s spine and the small mounds of her\nadolescent breasts showed under the fabric of her thin shirt.\nShae turned back to Doru. “You’re a wretch.”\n“Not for long, Shae-se. That is why you’re here, isn’t it? To hand out the clan’s justice.” Doru\neased his feet into the hot water and sighed. “It’s cold up here at night, much colder than in the city,\neven though it’s not very far away. I remember this kind of cold, but I used to be a younger man, so it\ndidn’t bother me as much.” A nostalgic softness came into Doru’s eyes. “During the war, the main\ncamp of the One Mountain Society was perhaps… ah, eight kilometers south of here.” He gestured\nvaguely off into the distance. “It was over difficult terrain, though, and the road from Janloon wasn’t\nnicely paved the way it is now. The village of Opia was our waypoint. Shae-se, there are no greater\npatriots on the island of Kekon than these simple country people. They hid us from Shotarian soldiers,\nthey tended our wounds, they hiked food and supplies into our camp. They were the first Lantern\nMen, truly—more so than all the company executives these days, the ones who used to send me gifts\nof fancy pens and bottles of hoji.”\n“And they hid you away even now,” Shae said. She glanced around the small kitchen and sitting\narea. There was only one bedroom attached to it, with a single narrow bed. Beyond the grimy lone\nwindow, the sky was growing dark.\nDoru shrugged. “Only as long as they were able. I knew the Mountain would eventually sell me\nback to No Peak. I cooperated with them for years, using my position as Weather Man and the\ninfluence I had with Kaul Sen and Lan—let the gods recognize them—only in the hopes of achieving\na peaceful solution for us all. Once I was out of No Peak and peace was no longer a possibility—what\nfurther use was I to anyone? I’m very grateful, however, that you were the one to come for me and\nnot that brute Maik Tar.”\nShae stared at the man who’d been her grandfather’s closest friend and advisor, who’d been a\nfixture in her family since before she’d been born. Yun Doru seemed even more fragile and shrunken\nthan the last time she’d seen him jade-stripped and captive in his own house over a year ago. His hair\nwas thin and nearly white, his eye sockets were recessed deeply in his long face, and his skin was an\nunhealthy pallor dappled with deep shadows in the light of the single bulb.\n“I’m dying, you see,” Doru said with utter indifference.

The moment the words were out of his\nmouth, Shae knew it was true; she could Perceive it now in the sickly limpness of his jade aura.\n“Cancer of the liver. In the late stages, I’m told.” The former Weather Man smiled wanly. “I hope you\ndidn’t bargain much in exchange for my life. It’s worth very little, and now that Kaul Sen has joined\nour comrades in the afterlife, I’ll be relieved to finally follow after him. You’ve come to do an old\nwarrior a mercy. I would ask, though, that we have a few minutes to speak alone.”\nShae hesitated, then said to Woon and Hami, “Wait outside.”\n“Shae-jen,” Woon protested, but Shae gave him a strong look to show she meant it. “Wait\noutside, like I said. I’ll handle this.”\nHami said to Doru, with pity and disgust, “You’re getting better than you deserve.”\nThe two men stepped out the door. Shae and Doru were alone. Doru took his feet out of the bath\nand dried them with the towel the girl had left. The window had fogged from the steam, and Shae\ncould smell the herbal scented salts. “I want you to know,” Doru said, “that I had every intention of\nkeeping my promise to you. I would’ve willingly remained a jadeless prisoner in my own home to\nkeep company with Kaul Sen in his final days.” Doru’s lips trembled, and Shae felt the pulse of grief\nin his enfeebled aura. “He was a great man, the greatest Green Bone of our generation, and a dear\nfriend—let the gods recognize him. I broke my word to you only because he insisted I do so, and I\nhave never disobeyed him in anything.”\nDoru slid his bare feet into slippers, and with painful creakiness, he stood and walked to a\nbattered yellow armchair, tying his bathrobe around his waist. He looked so frail in that moment that\nShae had to quell a strange urge to go help him. “What did you give to the Mountain when you went\nto them?” she asked.\n“Nothing, Shae-se—though not from lack of trying.” Doru lowered himself gingerly into the\narmchair, wincing at some unseen pain. “I went to Ayt Mada when the Mountain seemed poised to\nwin the war because I hoped to bargain for your safety. I volunteered my knowledge of No Peak’s\nbusinesses and offered to aid in the financial and operational merger after the Mountain was\nvictorious—on the condition that you be spared from harm. I asked the same for Anden, because I\nknew you would want it. Ayt refused. After the way you angered her, she had no intention of letting\nyou live.\n“I cannot tell you how relieved I was when Hilo turned the street war, even though it meant there\nwas no place or need for me.

The Mountain allowed me to remain here in Opia to tend to my health.\nAt first they set guards, supposedly for my protection, but in truth I was a prisoner—more to my own\nfailing body than anything else.” Doru coughed—a long, deep, wracking sound—then he looked up at\nher with a clear-eyed and serious expression. “Shae-se, even in this place, I hear things—and I always\nread the clouds. When I heard that the clans were declaring a truce, I was thankful, believe me. But so\nlong as Ayt Mada rules the Mountain, you will never be safe.”\nShae felt his words turn her hands and feet cold. “What should I do?”\n“To hold on to power, one must deny it to others. Ayt has no heir. There are prominent families\nin the Mountain that hope to succeed her, who are following behind like a pack of wolves waiting for\na stumble. The Iwe family is in the loyal inner circle, and the Vens are wealthy, but the Koben family\nhas the strongest claim and the most to gain. Ayt is a strong Pillar, but she is still human, and a\nwoman. Find a way to ally with her successor. It will be up to you, Shae-se, to end the war between\nthe clans, to find a way back to real peace.” Doru coughed again; it sounded like pneumonia. “Beyond\nthat, I have only the advice of an old Weather Man to a young one: Listen to everyone, but read the\nclouds for yourself.”\nShae’s voice felt abruptly tight in her throat. “Do you have anything else to say, Doru-jen?” The\ntime had come; she put her hand on the hilt of her moon blade but did not draw it yet.\nDoru reached around his neck and lifted off a chain with four jade stones. He held the gems in\nhis wrinkled, long-fingered hands for a moment, his eyes glistening. “This jade was your\ngrandfather’s,” he said. “It belongs in the Kaul family.” He set it down next to him on the small\nwooden side table. His familiar jade aura dissipated like smoke coming off a black log; only his slow\nheartbeat and wheezy breath remained in Shae’s Perception.\nShae felt heavy in her limbs. This encounter was not going as she’d envisioned. She’d hated\nDoru for years. Coming here, she’d imagined acting swiftly and with cold righteousness to correct the\nmistake she’d made by sparing him before. She had not expected to find him sick and suffering, most\nof the way to his grave already. It was time to act, but still she remained standing where she was,\nunable to move. Doru was a devious old pervert and he had committed treachery at the highest level\nof the clan, but as he folded his hands in his lap and gazed up at her with calm expectancy, she\nremembered that he had been an uncle to her, that he was Kaul Sen’s best and dearest friend.\nAn ache built in her chest, one that seemed to spread to her limbs and turn them to lead. She\ncouldn’t kill Doru. Her grandfather—let the gods recognize him—would never forgive her.\nThe former Weather Man let out a strangely satisfied sigh. “Ah, Shae-se, I’m afraid you’ve"

To lead a Green Bone clan, there are times you\nneed to be as cold as steel.” Doru shifted in his chair and opened the drawer of the side table. “Still, it\nmakes me glad to think that, even after all the ways I’ve lost your respect, you have some softness in\nyour heart for your old uncle after all. You were your grandfather’s favorite, and mine as well; I’ve\nnever wanted to cause you any trouble or heartache.” Shae realized what he was about to do an\ninstant before he took out the pistol, put the barrel in his mouth, and pulled the trigger.\nThe door of the small house slammed open and Woon burst in, moon blade drawn, jade aura\nblazing with alarm. He made some exclamation that Shae did not hear; the reverberation of the\ngunshot had turned her world silent. Doru’s body had been flung back against the seat and it slumped\nthere now, long limbs slack, wizened head lolled sideways on the thin neck. Bloody bits of his skull\nand brains were sprayed across the back of the armchair. Shae’s heart was stampeding so hard she\ncould feel the beat in her throat. Doru had acted so quickly and unhesitatingly, she hadn’t even\nPerceived it coming. To her surprise and shame, she felt tears prick the backs of her eyes.\nHami came in and stared at the body but said nothing. It was obvious what had happened. Shae\nhad failed, but Doru had accepted the clan’s justice nevertheless.\n“Collect the jade on the table; it belongs to the clan,” she said. She couldn’t bring herself to\napproach the body and claim it undeservedly for herself. Shae turned away and walked back out the\ndoor. She heard Woon following after her, but Hami lingered behind. She had damaged his respect for\nher; she understood that. The huddle of villagers gathered outside shifted back at her appearance,\nmaking room as she walked into their midst. “Who’s the headman of this town?” she asked.\nA bearded, middle-aged man in overalls and a flat cap came forward. Warily, he touched his\nclasped hands to his head and bent forward in salute.\n“Thank you for showing an old Green Bone kindness and hospitality in his final days,” Shae\nsaid, clearly enough for those gathered to hear. “If his presence was any hardship on you, I offer my\nclan’s gratitude and apologies.”\nThe headman glanced around at his fellow townspeople before turning back to Shae. It was dark\nnow, and she could not clearly read his expression in the light of the kerosene lamps that hung from\nwooden poles in front of the scattering of houses. “We’ve always fed and sheltered any Green Bone\nwho needs our help,” the headman said. He didn’t ask about what had happened in the cabin. It was a\ncustom engrained by past decades of war and occupation: The country folk of Kekon aided and\nharbored Green Bones without speaking of it to others and without asking questions—the better to\nprotect themselves from torture by Shotarian soldiers. The people of Opia held fast to tradition."

This part of the city used to be\nMountain territory; during the clan war, No Peak conquered the area, but nearly three months ago,\nHilo had ceded it back to the Mountain as part of the truce negotiation between the clans. None of this\nseemed to affect those who worked at or frequented the Celestial Radiance. The owners had two\nlanterns—one white, one pale green—and they swapped out which one hung in the front window\ndepending on the current jurisdiction. They paid token tribute as required, and the bathhouse had not\nincurred any damage during the periods of street violence. The Celestial Radiance was a social spot\nfor wives, and a place sought out by tourists to relax after sightseeing in the nearby Monument\nDistrict. It was not high value, and Green Bones would not suffer the disgrace of attacking a women’s\nbathhouse any more than they would be seen fighting over a daycare or a funeral home.\nSo even though Wen was technically three hundred meters inside enemy territory, she was not\nconcerned. The bodyguard who’d driven her here held open the car door, and Wen stepped out of the\ngreen Lumezza 6C convertible that her husband had bought for her as a wedding gift. A beautiful car,\nif not very practical. She was sweating by the time she crossed the short walkway and tiled steps to\nthe entryway; being seven months pregnant during summer in Janloon was an unpleasant ordeal.\nOnce inside, she checked in at the front desk and was shown to a changing stall, where she undressed,\nstowed her belongings, and entered the adjoining private room where she settled herself onto the\ncushioned table for a full-body scrub and prenatal massage. Five years ago, working for secretary’s\nwages at a small law firm and living in a cramped apartment in Paw-Paw, she would never have\nindulged in such luxuries. There were perks to being the wife of the Pillar. It was not a position to\nwhich she’d ever aspired; she’d expected to remain the wife of the Horn—a place with status, but\nmore anonymity, and requiring considerable emotional fortitude and self-sufficiency, as the Horn’s\njob was dangerous and unpredictable and called him away at all hours. Lina possessed such admirable\nqualities, which was why Wen had introduced her to Kehn.\nBeing the wife of the Pillar on the other hand, meant visibility.

She dressed\nimpeccably; she took care of her body. Her health was very important. She hoped to eventually return\nto interior design work, but for the next few years, she had greater responsibilities as a wife and\nmother. The clan was not just people and jade and money. It was an idea, a legacy that connected the\npast with the present and the future. The family’s strength was a promise. Lan was dead and his son\nwas far away (although Wen hoped that would soon change). Shae was not about to have children any\ntime soon. Kehn and Lina were not yet married, and Wen was not sure what to do about Tar. The\nTeijes shared blood with the Kauls but were of no consideration. Knowing that her contribution to the\nclan was crucial and hers alone gave Wen a sense of anticipatory satisfaction even greater than the\nnormal glow of an expectant mother. The baby kicked Wen in the ribs and rolled like a small\nmountain across her abdomen. The masseuse smiled and said, “Your child is already so athletic, Mrs.\nKaul.”\nFeeling refreshed after her spa treatments, Wen took a brief dip in the mineral pool, showered,\nand dressed in soft lounge pants, a tank top, and fleece robe. She went into the teahouse and sat cross-\nlegged at a low table in one of the many screened nooks intended to create a sense of calm and retreat\nfrom the bustle of everyday life in the city. Lush potted ferns and broad-leafed plants created a\nmodest indoor garden, and a stone water fountain burbled pleasantly in the background. Most of the\nother women in the teahouse were older than Wen; some stayed contentedly to themselves with a\nbook or newspaper, others chatted with friends or played circle chess or cards. Wen ordered a sesame\npastry and a glass of chilled spiced tea with lemon. The server, a plump, grandmotherly woman,\nsmiled knowingly at Wen and brought her the entire lemon, cut into delicate wedges on a small white\ndish. Superstition held that sucking the juice of an entire lemon each day guaranteed a masculine\nchild. So did taking daily walks at dawn (dusk for a female child), eating spicy food, and conceiving\non designated lucky days (as determined by fortune charts cross-referencing the birthdates of the\nfather and mother).

Wen was not the superstitious sort—what was the point when one was already a\nstone-eye?—and she left praying to the gods to her sister-in-law, but she smiled and thanked the\nwoman anyway, waiting until she was gone to dispose of the lemon in a nearby planter. The sex of the\nbaby was already set; why sour her mouth for nothing?\nA slight woman of about the same age as Wen approached and glanced around nervously before\nsitting down at the table. Wen said in a low voice of concern, “How have you been, Mila? How’s your\ndaughter?” The woman looked away, tugging at her long sleeves. Wen was struck with pity for her.\nMila said in a mumble, “I’ve sent her to stay at a friend’s house for a few days.”\n“That’s good,” Wen said gently. “You’re doing everything you can to keep her safe. That’s all a\nmother can do.” When Mila rubbed her eyes and nodded, Wen said, “What do you have?”\nThe woman removed a manila envelope from her handbag and passed it under the table to Wen,\nwho tucked it into her own tote bag without looking at it. Mila twisted her hands together in her lap\nand said in a hurry, “The new Weather Man, Iwe Kalundo, took over the office last week. He’s been\nbusy holding one-on-one meetings with all the top Lantern Men in the clan. I saw his schedule for the\nwhole month lying open on his secretary’s desk and made a photocopy of it.”\n“Thank you.” Wen slid Mila an unmarked envelope of cash, which vanished quickly into the\nwoman’s purse. Akul Min Mila worked as a low-level department secretary in the Weather Man’s\noffice of the Mountain clan, also located in the Financial District, five kilometers north of Kaul Shae’s\noffice on Ship Street. She was married to a violent drunk who regularly beat her and their eight-year-\nold daughter. Her husband came from a well-connected family within the Mountain; Mila feared\nretribution if she told anyone within the clan. She was secretly saving up the money that No Peak\npaid her for the information she stole from the office so she could take her daughter and run away to\nher only relatives, who lived in Toshon, all the way in the south of the country.\nAs the rat stood up to go, Wen said, “Mila, don’t rush or take unnecessary risks. You’ve survived\nthis long already; make sure that when you leave for good, there’s no suspicion.”\nThe woman hesitated, biting her lip and looking at Wen with a sort of cornered gratitude. Then\nshe nodded, turned away, and left. Mila was not very knowledgeable about the Mountain’s business\nand did not always know what to look for, copying whatever she saw lying around when the\nopportunity arose. Some of what she gave to Wen was useful, much of it was not, but she was\nmotivated. Wen was cautiously optimistic this time; the detailed meeting schedule of Ayt Mada’s new\nWeather Man would shed light on the Mountain’s business priorities and biggest constituents.\nWen sipped her spiced tea and rubbed her swollen feet.

It was as Hilo had said to Kehn and Tar at the dinner\ntable: No Peak needed rats everywhere, not only on the street, and not only on the Horn’s side. The\nwomen’s bathhouse was perhaps the most invisible place in the city for Wen to meet spies; she rarely\nsaw Green Bones here, and those she did see—stressed young women needing a break from keeping\nup with their male peers—had their facials or massages and left without lingering in the teahouse.\nThe owners were well aware that they were located on a territorial border and had absolutely nothing\nto gain from betraying either clan and risking their advantageous status as a business of no disputable\nimportance. And while the Weather Man of No Peak could not spend a suspiciously large number of\nhours receiving spa services, no one batted an eye at the indulgences of the Pillar’s wife.\nWen had considered telling Hilo what she was doing. Perhaps it would prove to him that she was\nserious and capable of being fully involved in the clan’s matters, and even if he did not approve on\nprinciple, he would have to see the enormous usefulness of her actions and come over to her thinking.\nHilo was accepting of people as they were; he had never once made her feel shame for her parents’\nwell-known disgrace across both major clans, her rumored illegitimacy, or her condition as a stone-\neye. For that, she loved him ferociously. She hated to keep secrets from him. But for Kaul Hilo, there\nwas a stark division in the world that determined a person’s duties and destiny—a line drawn with\njade.\nWhen she became pregnant, Wen reluctantly came to the conclusion that her husband would not\ncondone even the minimal risk she was taking by meeting informers in the Celestial Radiance. In\naddition, being honest with Hilo would mean exposing Shae’s orchestration, and the Weather Man\nwas entitled to the secrecy of her methods and sources of information. As long as Hilo thought his\nwife’s bathhouse visits were simply innocuous pampering and good for her health and that of the\nbaby, he would see no reason to prevent them. The potential value of what she and Shae might learn\nabout the clan’s enemies was more important than Wen’s peace of mind, and the relationship between\nthe Pillar and the Weather Man could not be risked. The family’s survival depended on it. The Pillar\nwas the master of the clan, the spine of the body, but a spine that was not well supported would sag\nand break. Wen’s late brother-in-law, Kaul Lan, had been a good Pillar, but dragged down by a senile\ngrandfather, a treacherous Weather Man, and a faithless wife. He’d tried too hard to carry the clan on\nhis own, hadn’t claimed help when he should have, had kept his sister and his cousin out of the clan at\nthe time he needed them the most. He’d made every effort to be strong, and it had made him weak.\nWen would not let that happen to her own husband.\nShe relaxed on the cushions and read a book for fifteen minutes until she saw her second\ninformer pad into the teahouse in slippers, smelling of bath salts.

A woman in her late fifties, Mrs.\nLonto was a hairdresser who had owned and run her salon in the wealthy, Mountain-controlled\ndistrict of High Ground for thirty years. Over the decades, she’d heard all manner of stories, rumors,\nand gossip circulate among her clientele, which consisted primarily of the wives, mothers, and other\nfemale relatives of the Mountain’s highest-rank Fists, Luckbringers, and Lantern Men. Not only were\nMrs. Lonto’s clients keenly, jealously aware of the social standing, fortunes, and alliances of the\nvarious powerful families in the Mountain, more than a few of them whispered harshly about Ayt\nMada, the one woman who controlled the lives of their men more than they did.\nMrs. Lonto had come to the Celestial Radiance regularly for years, and she had approached Wen\ninstead of the other way around. One day, she’d seen the Pillar’s wife coming out of the mineral\nsoaking pool and said, “Mrs. Kaul, I’m very sorry to disturb you, but…” The woman’s face trembled\nin desperation. “My son has caused offense against your clan, and I don’t know who to turn to for\nmercy.” The salon owner’s troubled eldest son had robbed a store at gunpoint in No Peak territory for\nmoney to buy drugs. In the process, he shot and wounded two innocent bystanders, including the\nuncle of one of No Peak’s senior Fingers. Fortunately for Mrs. Lonto’s son, he was apprehended by\nthe Janloon police and thrown into jail before the clan got to him, but the offended Finger in No Peak\nhad every intention of seeking out the robber upon his release, and if not killing him, at least handing\nhim such a savage beating that he would beg to be returned to prison.\nMrs. Lonto was taking out a loan against her hair salon to pay for her incarcerated son’s\naddiction treatment, but despite knowing many people in the Mountain, she refused to ask for\nfinancial help or protection for her son from anyone in the clan. Her grandson by her daughter was\nnine years old and applying for entry to Wie Lon; as he was a borderline case, Mrs. Lonto was afraid\nto draw any attention to the taint of drug use and criminality in the immediate family, as it would\ncompletely destroy his chances. After hearing Mrs. Lonto’s story, Wen spoke to Kehn, who spoke to\nthe Finger in No Peak, who was persuaded to renounce his grievance in exchange for a formal\napology and the offender’s ear in a box. (Luckily for everyone, the uncle had made a complete\nrecovery.) Now, Mrs. Lonto looked to be in a heartened mood as she sat down across from Wen and\ntold her that her son’s rehab was going well and he been clean for four months. Wen congratulated\nher; it was nice to know the money No Peak paid to secure the woman’s eyes and ears in High\nGround went to some charitable use. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Kaul,” Mrs. Lonto said. “I don’t have much to\nsay this week. There hasn’t been much news, and business has been quiet. People have gone to the\ncoast because of the heat.”\n“That’s all right,” Wen replied. “I still want to speak with you about some events that happened"

        "text": "coast because of the heat.”\n“That’s all right,” Wen replied. “I still want to speak with you about some events that happened\nin the past, that I think you might know about.” When the older woman nodded warily, Wen folded\nher hands on top of her rounded belly and said, “Tell me everything you know about the Koben\nfamily.”\nWen made three further visits to the Celestial Radiance Bath & Tea House over the following two\nweeks to meet with additional informers who could corroborate and expand upon what she heard\nfrom Mrs. Lonto. She had a few casual conversations with the most gossipy relatives in Lina’s large\nand well-connected family, and she made a visit to the national library and archives in Wisdom Hall\nto examine some public records. Wen conveyed everything she learned to Shae, who combined it with\nother information she possessed of the Mountain’s business dealings to gain a better understanding of\ntheir enemy’s situation.\nAccording to Mrs. Lonto and others, when Ayt Eodo, second adopted son of the clan patriarch,\nAyt Yugontin, was murdered on the orders of his sister, Ayt Madashi, he left behind a wife who did\nnot grieve him. Eodo’s marriage had not been a happy one, for several reasons including the fact that\nhe was a hopeless philanderer. His widow might’ve found it in herself to feel some more sadness if he\nhadn’t been assassinated naked in his mistress’s apartment—insulting to her even in death. She\nreturned to her parents, dropped her married name, and raised her then four-year-old son under her\nfamily name: Koben.\nThe Kobens were a large family of moderate status in the Mountain clan. They counted among\ntheir ranks nearly two dozen Green Bones, including several Fists, many more Fingers, a few\nteachers, a doctor, and a penitent. Other members of the family were midlevel Luckbringers or small\nbusiness Lantern Men, or held other respectable jobs connected to the clan. Although they were\ngenerally dependable people, they were no superlative leaders or talents. Some described them as\nstingy and stubborn, with more guts than brains. At one time, it seemed their star had been on the rise,\nwhen one of their own married into the great Ayt family, but upon Eodo’s death, they counted\nthemselves lucky the marriage had been a disaster and were quick to make it clear to the new Pillar\nthat they had never liked the man anyway.\nKoben Atosho, born Ayt Ato, was Ayt Mada’s only nephew. He had few memories of his late\nfather and had been raised with no love for him. He was now nine years old; in the coming year he\nwould finish primary school and be admitted to Wie Lon Temple School to begin his martial\neducation. With this milestone, the Koben family hoped the Pillar would recognize the boy as Ayt\nYu’s grandson and her potential heir, and consequently, that the Koben family’s prestige would rise\nwithin the clan.\nThe two main obstacles to their aspirations were named Ven and Iwe. The Ven family was\nsmaller than the Koben family but one of the wealthiest in Kekon. The patriarch, Ven Sandolan,\nowned the largest freight shipping company in the country.

He had three sons and two daughters; the\neldest son was a respected, high-rank Fist. Ven Sando was an influential man in the business world,\nand also not afraid to be critical of his own clan when he believed criticism was called for.\nThe Iwe family was not as numerous as the Kobens or as wealthy as the Vens, but Iwe Kalundo\nhad just become Weather Man of the Mountain. Iwe was thirty-six years old and a longtime friend\nand colleague of the Pillar; he had worked under Ayt Mada back when she had been Weather Man\nherself. The Iwes were pleased by speculation that Ayt saw her Weather Man as her most likely\nsuccessor. It would go a long way toward removing their poor reputation. They were less gifted in\njade ability but as prone to the Itches as the infamous Aun family, and were suspected of being shine\naddicts.\nShae explained the situation at the family table after dinner the following Seventhday. “Ayt faces\npressure to clarify the line of succession in her clan, but she’s understandably avoiding the issue. The\nKoben boy’s only nine—too early for anyone to judge his abilities, and Ayt’s had no part in his\nupbringing. Iwe Kalundo’s brand-new in his job. Ayt surely plans to be Pillar for a long time and\nwants to keep her options for a successor open; naming an heir now would only undercut her\nauthority by raising the status of some other family.”\nHilo rolled an unlit cigarette between his fingers, eyes narrowed in thought. “You say Doru\nthought the Kobens had the strongest claim.”\n“The others seem like long shots,” the Weather Man replied. “The Vens have wealth and\ninfluence but no legitimate claim, and they’re outside of Ayt’s favor; they were slow to declare their\nallegiance after Ayt became Pillar, initially supporting her brother until that wasn’t an option\nanymore. She might want to hang on to the Ven family’s money and support, but she’s unlikely to let\nthem anywhere near the leadership.”\nShae took a sip of tea and pushed the rest of her dessert toward Wen. “The Iwes, on the other\nhand, are completely loyal to Ayt and wouldn’t talk to us if we approached them. Iwe Kalundo’s\npersonal reputation is entirely solid, but his father died of the Itches and there’s been shine addiction\nin his family. There are a lot of people in the Mountain who wouldn’t support the leadership of the\nclan going to that bloodline.”\nKehn scratched his eyebrow and frowned. “It’s what the Pillar thinks that matters,” he pointed\nout. “If Ayt trusts Iwe enough to make him the Weather Man and he does a good job, maybe she\nwon’t care what the other families say.”\n“Maybe,” Shae replied slowly, “but the Kobens have far more people and the Ayt family\nconnection.” Succession in a Green Bone clan was not strictly hereditary, but there was a strong\nhistorical and cultural bias in favor of keeping it within family.\n“The boy doesn’t have any blood in common with Ayt Yu or Ayt Mada,” Tar said, throwing up"

If we were on friendly terms with the Koben family, it could strengthen their\nposition by suggesting to both clans that peace would continue under their leadership. And with the\nKobens on our side, Ayt might think twice about openly coming after us.” The Weather Man made a\ngrudging noise. “It makes sense, as a defensive move.”\nWen looked around the table. Then she spoke to her husband, in a mild but meaningful way.\n“Doru was a good strategist. He obviously thought a great deal about how to bring the clans\ntogether.” She touched Hilo’s knee. “That was what he wanted, what he tried to arrange behind Lan’s\nback: unification. So now we know what not to do, if we want something different.”\nKehn and Tar and even Shae seemed surprised at Wen asserting herself in the discussion, but\nHilo smiled at her approvingly. “It seems that old weasel Doru was a help to us in the end after all.”\nHe turned to Shae. “Find a way for me to meet with Ven Sandolan.”\nCHAPTER\n16\nNot a Thief\nA\nnden became accustomed to the routine of his life in Port Massy. The summer days lengthened and\ngrew hot and muggy, although the city more often than not remained overcast and colorless. Despite\nhimself, Anden grew to be on cordial terms with his classmates, and he got to know a few of the\nHians’ neighbors. On two other occasions, he saw the Green Bone on the bicycle—once speeding by\nin the opposite direction on the other side of the street, once standing on the street corner talking to a\ntrio of other young men while Anden passed on the city bus.\nAnden was inordinately curious and wanted to ask the man a thousand questions. When he\nmentioned his encounter to the Hians, they said, “Ah, that’s Dauk Corujon. He’s going to law school;\nwe’re all very proud of him. Yes, of course he’s green; he’s a true Kekonese son. How many Green\nBones are there here? In our neighborhood?” Mr. Hian shrugged. “Thirty? Forty? Who knows.”\nAnden was amazed. Shae had studied in Espenia but had never mentioned anyone wearing jade.\nHe suspected she had never come across any during the time she resided in graduate school housing\nin the college town of Windton where there was no significant Kekonese community. Port Massy\ncontained twenty times the population of Windton, and showed its roots as a trading hub in the\npeople, food, and goods that could be found from every part of the world. Riding the bus every day,\nAnden had heard many different languages spoken, and he imagined it would be possible to survive\nin Port Massy without actually learning Espenian, by sticking closely with one’s own people.

Now\nthat Anden knew there were Green Bones living near him in secret, he kept trying to spot them. He\nstudied ordinary-looking men and women in the grocery store, standing in line at the bank, strolling\ndown the sidewalk. He queried Mr. and Mrs. Hian frequently.\n“Mr. Tow? Of course not. Can you imagine him as a Green Bone?” Mrs. Hian snorted. Later on,\n“Oh, yes, the Ruen family—all Green Bones. Ruen-jen has been teaching the jade disciplines for\nyears.” They were amused by his extreme interest, not fully appreciating that Anden had been\nsurrounded by Green Bones all his life and from his first day in Port Massy had found the absence of\nthem one of the most disquieting things about Espenia. Conversely, discovering their covert existence\nin the Southtrap neighborhood was oddly reassuring.\nNo matter how hard he looked, however, he didn’t see any jade on display—no piercings, no\nrings or bracelets or gem-studded belts. It was entirely bewildering. In Janloon, jade was an\nunmistakable mark of status—it commanded respect in the darkest alleys of the Coinwash district and\nthe boardrooms of the highest skyscrapers in the Financial District. Green Bones wore their jade\nopenly and proudly and would not think to hide it unless they had some desire to appear especially\nmodest or unassuming.\nIt made social interactions in Espenia difficult, Anden felt, not even knowing who to address as\njen. “This isn’t Kekon,” Mr. Hian reminded him. “The Espenians don’t appreciate that jade is part of\nour culture. They would think we’re trying to threaten them or stand out as different. Showing off\njade would only be asking for trouble.”\nAs fascinated as Anden was by the unusual jade subculture, he didn’t make any special effort to\nmeet the neighborhood Green Bones or to find out where they trained and socialized. He was, after\nall, not a Green Bone himself—a fact that still stirred a sense of shame in him every time he thought\nabout it, although the feeling had diminished over the months. Far away from Janloon, his disgrace\nwithin the No Peak clan was unknown and he wasn’t reminded of it constantly the way he had been\nback home. Here in Southtrap, where a person couldn’t tell who was and wasn’t green, it didn’t seem\nto matter as much. He had no expectation that he would become personally involved with Green\nBone matters ever again—until he made an understandable but serious mistake.\nWith the student allowance Shae had provided for him and Mr. Hian’s help in perusing the\nclassifieds section of the local newspaper, Anden had purchased a secondhand bicycle, which he kept\nchained in the alley behind Mr. and Mrs. Hian’s row house and hoped to use more often now that the\nweather was agreeable and sometimes even sunny. One afternoon late in the summer, he rode his bike\nto a nearby park, where he settled under a tree to complete the week’s assigned readings. He ended up\ndozing off afterward. When he awoke, he gathered his belongings, fetched his bike from the rack, and\nheaded back to the Hians’ home.\nHe’d gone no more than half a block when he heard yelling and glanced back to see a man"

Anden stopped and put a foot down. His pursuer caught up;\nhe was a man in his early twenties, not much older than Anden himself. His face was a splotchy pink\nand his large teeth were bared in anger. “What’re you doing? That’s my bike!”\nAnden looked down and saw that, indeed, he had taken the wrong bicycle. It was nearly identical\nto his own, but the red paint was new and unscratched, the tread on the tires still pristine. The owner\nseized the handlebars. “You thought you could steal my new bike?” He launched into an accusatory\ntirade in Espenian too rapid for Anden to follow.\n“Sorry.” Anden’s face burned with embarrassment as he got off the bike. “Sorry. Mistake.”\nThe man shoved Anden aside roughly. “You’ve got to be the dumbest thief around. You have any\nidea who I am? Don’t you even speak Espenian?”\nAnden’s grasp of the language was far from perfect, but he understood enough to know he was\nbeing accused of thievery. At first he was astonished; then a surge of angry defensiveness flooded up\nhis neck and into his head. Thieves were the lowest sort of people; being called a thief was worse than\nbeing called a coward or a degenerate. Men in Kekon were killed for less. Who would say such an\nabusive thing to a complete stranger, without giving the other person any chance to explain? “No\nsteal,” he protested vehemently. “I said mistake.”\n“Yeah, sure, nice try. Get out of here, go back to wherever you came from, you dumb fuck.” The\nman began to push his bike away. Anden stood dumbfounded for a second. Then he took several\nquick strides and grabbed the back of the bicycle seat. The man spun back around, his mouth open in\noutraged surprise.\n“I didn’t steal your bike.” Anden enunciated each word. “Apologize.”\n“Are you kidding me?” shouted the man. “You sound like a keck—is that what you are? You\nwant your fucking face smashed?” He dropped his bike to the ground and faced Anden with fists\nupraised.\nAnden experienced a moment of severe doubt. All he’d wanted was for the man to take back\nwhat he’d said; no one deserved to be roughly treated and slandered over such a simple error. He\nwasn’t keen to fight this man, but he couldn’t think of any way out that didn’t involve retreating—\nwhich was not acceptable, as he was the one who’d been so badly insulted. In Janloon, if he’d had\nfriends with him as witnesses, he might’ve tried to reschedule the contest to a later time and place—\nsometimes, cooler heads prevailed in the interim—but he had no idea what the dueling customs were\nin Espenia, and it didn’t look as if the other man was about to back down.\nAnden took off his glasses and put them in the side pocket of his school bag before setting it\ndown on the grass next to the sidewalk.

He raised his fists and fell into a poised, evenly weighted\nstance, still wondering why it had come to this at all. Why couldn’t the other man have simply\naccepted his apology for the mistake and moved on?\nThe man’s eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed in angry menace. “Oh, you’re asking for it\nnow, you cocky little—” He rushed forward and swung at Anden’s head.\nIt had been some time—his final Trials at the Academy, to be exact—since Anden had fought,\nand he was initially slow to react. He barely fended off the man’s opening barrage of punches, and\nthough he saw the obvious opportunity to counterattack, he’d overcompensated for his sluggish\nreflexes by retreating too far out of striking range and couldn’t move fast enough to close the distance\nbefore his opponent squared up to face him again. Anden shook his head, frustrated at himself; Hilo\nwould’ve cuffed him hard about the head for being so sloppy. As he was thinking this, his adversary\npopped a perfect jab through his guard and hit Anden in the cheek.\nPain bloomed in Anden’s face. Being struck seemed to snap an entire childhood of martial\ntraining back into place; he lowered his chin and shoulders and ducked under the next blow, burying a\nfist in the man’s side. His opponent grunted in pain and made to fling an arm around Anden’s neck in\na headlock. Anden dropped the point of his elbow into the man’s thigh and shoved himself backward,\ndodging under the grip and sending the Espenian stumbling ahead. The man recovered his footing\nimmediately and came back at Anden with an onslaught of heavy blows. Most of them battered\nAnden’s raised arms but a few connected with his stomach and sides with eye-watering force, and one\npopped him in the mouth hard enough to cut his lip on his teeth. There was little finesse to the man’s\nfighting, but there was plenty of speed and power, and the brash instinct of someone who’d been in\nmore than his fair share of scraps before. He was larger than Anden, and angrier, and in this blunt\nphysical contest, those two things gave him the advantage.\nIt occurred to Anden, in a sudden surge of panic and shame, that he—the youngest member of\nthe Kaul family, schooled at one of the best martial academies on Kekon—was about to be beaten by\nan Espenian street brawler.\nAnden gasped with pain but held his ground; arms still tucked close against his head, he popped\nhis elbow up and clipped his opponent in the chin. Planting his shoe in the man’s abdomen, he kicked\nhim back with as forceful a thrust as he could muster. When the Espenian regained his balance and\ncame forward again, Anden backed up hastily, as if reluctant to engage with him again—not an\naltogether false sentiment. He felt his heel touch the edge of the sidewalk. As the other man\ncommitted his weight to the next blow, Anden jumped back off the curb. He caught the man’s\noutstretched arm and pulled.

It was not a forceful move, just a sharp tug at the wrist, but with their\ncombined momentum, the Espenian went forward; his leading foot landed off the curb and he went\nstaggering headlong. Even so, he was nimble and wouldn’t have fallen; Anden had to solve that by\npunching downward as his opponent’s upper body tipped, connecting hard with the side of the face,\nscraping ear to jaw.\nThe Espenian put his hands out, breaking his fall as he landed on the asphalt. Anden wasted no\ntime; he struck the man again, then kneed him in the chest. His opponent tried to throw his arms\naround Anden’s legs; Anden dodged aside and kicked him in the ribs. The man finally rolled into a\nball, groaning in pain, and Anden leapt upon him, straddling him across the chest and holding a fist\npoised over his swollen face.\n“Do you want to stop?” The man didn’t answer, so Anden hit him in the mouth hard enough to\ncut his knuckles on the man’s teeth. “Do you want to stop?” he asked again, and was relieved when\nthis time the Espenian nodded. “Say I’m not a thief,” Anden insisted.\n“Wh-what?” the man slurred through puffy lips.\nAnden drew his fist back again. “Say I’m not a thief.”\n“Fine, fine, you crazy fuck! You’re—you’re not—”\nSeveral arms grabbed Anden around the arms and chest and hauled him off the man and back\nonto the sidewalk. Anden looked around in surprise and confusion to see a small semicircle of\ngathered bystanders; two large men had pulled him away, and another person squatted down to check\non his downed opponent. Anden shook off the restraining hands. Why had they interfered? Clearly,\nhe’d won fairly; the other man had been on the verge of conceding.\nOne of the bystanders appeared to be Kekonese. Anden called out to him in his native language,\n“What’s going on? What’s the problem?” but the man looked at him with stony displeasure.\nAnden’s opponent crawled to his feet. “You’re dead, you hear me?” His voice was a deadly\nsnarl. “I don’t know who you think you are, but you step on Carson Sunter, you step on the wrong\ncrewboy. I’m going to find you, and I’m going to kill you.” He spat a glob of blood onto the sidewalk\nat Anden’s feet, then turned and stumbled away, retrieving his bicycle and leaning on it for support as\nhe disappeared down the street, snarling profanities.\nThe small group of spectators dispersed, none of them willing to look at Anden. Again, Anden\nspoke to the Kekonese man, who he was sure he’d seen around their neighborhood. “What happened?\nDid I do something wrong?”\nTo his astonishment, the man responded in Espenian. “What did you do that for? You want to\ngive all of us a bad name? Beating a man up over a bicycle?” In an added rush of Kekonese, “Are you"

Beating a man up over a bicycle?” In an added rush of Kekonese, “Are you\ntrying to be one of those clan goons from the old country?” Shooting Anden a parting look of disdain,\nhe turned away and left, leaving Anden on the sidewalk.\nWhen Anden walked in the front door, Mrs. Hian let out an appalled gasp. “What have you been\ndoing?” she exclaimed, sitting him down in a chair at the kitchen table and rushing to fetch ice and\nsalve for his swollen cheek and lip. “How did this happen?”\nAfter Anden had relayed his story, Mr. and Mrs. Hian exchanged a grim look. “This isn’t good,”\nsaid Mr. Hian with a worried sigh. “It may cause problems for us.”\n“I don’t understand,” Anden protested. “He insulted and challenged me, and I won the fight\nfairly. He conceded; people saw it. If he comes back for vengeance, he would be in the wrong.”\n“Anden-se,” Mr. Hian said somberly. “Dueling is not allowed in this country. The Espenian\ncourts will not uphold the result of any dispute solved by a duel, even if the parties were willing.”\n“That man could come back to harm you, or more likely, his family could demand money from\nus,” Mrs. Hian explained as she dabbed Anden’s bloodied face.\n“Under the law in Espenia,” Mr. Hian explained, “there is no such thing as a clean blade.”\nAnden sat in silent dismay for so long that the Hians looked even more anxious and tried their\nbest to comfort him. Mrs. Hian got up and rubbed his back and said, “Don’t feel bad; it’s our fault,\nnot yours. You were only defending your reputation and your family’s name; how could you know\nthat the rules here make no sense? We should’ve explained it to you, but we didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Mr. Hian offered Anden a glass of hoji and a cigarette and said, “Don’t worry too much.”\n“What do we do now?” Anden asked miserably.\nMrs. Hian’s mouth was set in a worried line. She turned to her husband, who folded his arms on\nthe small kitchen table and nodded reluctantly. “We must go to the Pillar.”\nCHAPTER\n17\nThe Pillar of Southtrap\nT\nhe following evening, Anden and the Hians took the bus six stops to the other side of the Southtrap\nneighborhood where they entered a blue, split-level house and were greeted by a woman of about fifty\nwith permed hair and white nail polish, who welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Hian warmly and ushered them\ninside. “You must be Anden, the student from Janloon who’s here studying,” she said.\n“Yes, Auntie,” Anden said, and the woman exclaimed, “So polite!” and smiled at him\napprovingly. “Come in, you can put your shoes there. Losun-se!” she called down the stairs.\nA man came up the steps, wiping his dusty hands with a rag. The sleeves of his flannel shirt were\nrolled up to his elbows. “Nearly done putting in the bathroom tiles,” he said, unrolling his sleeves and\nbuttoning the cuffs. “After this, I think the basement will almost be finished.”"

What clan does he lead?” He was\nbewildered and wondered why none of this had been mentioned to him before.\nMr. Hian had scratched his beard. “Well, it’s not the same as it is in Janloon. We don’t have that\nmany Green Bones. Dauk Losunyin is the one that the others obey, and the only man around here that\nall of us call Pillar, so I suppose that makes him…” Mr. Hian shrugged. “The Pillar of Southtrap.”\nThe Pillar was a heavyset, balding man with large, tradesman’s hands and a friendly, agreeable\ncountenance. Looking at him, Anden did not know what to think. This man did not strike him as a\nGreen Bone warrior, much less as the leader of a Green Bone clan. His house was smaller than the\nguesthouse on the Kaul property. He gave off no great sense of power or authority; picturing him next\nto someone like Kaul Hilo or Ayt Mada was laughable.\n“Dauk-jen,” said Mr. Hian, clasping his hands and touching them to his forehead. He bent into\nthe salute to show his great respect. Mrs. Hian did the same and handed Mrs. Dauk a plate of\nhomemade almond paste buns. “Thank you for having us over,” said Mr. Hian. “This is Emery\nAnden, the student from Janloon, the one we told you about.”\nAnden followed his host family’s lead and inclined in a formal salute. “Dauk-jen.”\nDauk clapped Anden on the shoulder in an amiable way. “How’re you liking Espenia?”\n“I… um… I’m getting used to it, jen,” Anden replied.\nThe Pillar chuckled. “It does take some getting used to, doesn’t it?” He motioned them through\nthe kitchen and into the dining room, where he proceeded to pull up extra chairs at the oval wooden\ntable. There was an alcove in the wall between the kitchen and dining room with a lustrous green vase\nthat made Anden’s jaw fall open, until he realized that it was not, as he’d thought upon first glance, an\nastonishing and dangerous amount of jade, but a decorative item made of nephrite.\nThen he noticed two small matching carved statues of horses on the mantel, and a candleholder\non a side table next to the sofa, all made of bluffer’s jade. In Janloon, such a display of false green in\none’s home or business would be terribly gauche. Was it because the Kekonese-Espenians had so\nlittle real jade, and could not wear it openly, that they showed the fakes instead? Or maybe, Anden\nthought, they appreciated the ostentatious appearance of the inert ornaments as a visible reminder of\ntheir cultural heritage?\nThe front door opened and a young man walked in.

It was the Green Bone that Anden had seen\nbefore, the one who’d saved the woman from running into traffic some months ago. Mrs. Dauk\nhurried to the door to greet him. “Coru, I didn’t think you’d make it home for dinner tonight.”\nThe young man took off his cap and gave his mother a hug. “We have guests?”\n“Mr. and Mrs. Hian, you know them,” Mrs. Dauk said, “and this is Emery Anden, a student from\nKekon who’s living with them while he studies at Port Massy College.”\nAnden realized he was staring like an idiot. Only now did he remember that Mr. Hian had told\nhim the Green Bone’s family name was Dauk. It had been so long ago, he’d forgotten and not drawn\nthe connection. The quick-witted bicyclist was the son of the Pillar.\nCoru’s eyes widened in recognition. Then he grinned. A dimple formed in the center of his brow,\nand his dark eyes danced with mirth. “So we meet again,” he said in Espenian. “And you still have\nthe expression of a startled deer, same as you did the first time I saw you.”\nAnden blinked and said, in halting Espenian, “You surprised me both times, jen.”\nMrs. Dauk exclaimed, “Coru, what kind of a way is that for you to talk to a guest?” She gave her\nson a reproachful smack across the back of the head. “Speak Kekonese!”\n“It’s all right, Mrs. Dauk,” Anden said, warmth rising into his face. “I need to practice my\nEspenian if I’m to get any good at it. Your son was only being helpful, as he… often seems to be.”\n“Sana,” Dauk Losun called. “How long before dinner?”\n“It’s ready,” his wife called in reply, rushing back into the kitchen and bringing out a steel pot,\nwhich she placed on a trivet in the center of the table. “The pork stew is not quite done, but\neverything else is. I’ll bring it out later. Don’t stand there everyone; sit down and start eating!”\nIt was crowded around the table with six people. Dauk Sana had made more than enough food—\nspicy cabbage, shrimp with lemon chili sauce, and the belated vinegar pork stew, which had generous\nchunks of mushroom and egg in it—all of it traditional, homey Kekonese food, with the exception of\nthe long, thick, dark salted crackers that went around the table in a basket; Espenians seemed to serve\nthem as an accompaniment at every meal, for scooping up food like a spoon and dipping into soups\nand stews. Anden was seated next to Dauk Coru, who ate heartily and, like a good Kekonese son,\ncomplimented his mother on all the dishes.\nAnden tried desperately to think of a way to start a normal conversation with his neighbor at the\ntable without bringing up their awkward prior encounters.

He kept glancing over, trying to see if he\ncould spot the jade Coru wore. Anden leaned over, deliberately timing his reach for the basket of\ncrackers so that his arm brushed close to the other man’s. A tingle went through his elbow and deep\ninto his bones; he felt a firm tug in his gut, like a steel hook on the mouth of a fish before it’s yanked\nfrom the water. Anden broke into a sweat; it had been a long time since he’d been close enough to\nfeel another’s jade aura. After such an absence, his own body’s unmistakable, longing reaction to the\nproximity of jade made him nearly dizzy. He shivered and drew his arm away.\n“So, how long are you here for?” Coru asked.\n“Hm?” Anden hastily pulled himself together. “Ah, two years. Long enough for me to complete\nthe language immersion program and get an associate degree. That’s the plan, anyway.”\nCoru took another mouthful of food without asking a follow-up question. After an unwieldy\npause, Anden said, “So… Coru-jen, I hear you’re a student too. You’re going to law school?”\nThe other young man looked up at him and laughed. “Nobody calls me Coru except my parents\nand their friends. Everyone else calls me Cory.” He wiped his hand and held it out to shake Anden’s.\n“Now that we’ve met properly, yeah, I’m going into the law program at Watersguard U next fall. I’m\ntaking this year off to do some community volunteering and save up tuition money working as a\nparalegal. And I’m planning to travel the country for six weeks next summer.” He tilted his chin up\nand raised his voice so his father could hear him. “Before I’m forced to follow in my sister’s\nfootsteps.”\n“You have an older sister?” Anden asked.\n“Three of them.” Cory shook his head. “Feel free to pity me.”\nAnden didn’t know what it was like to have so many sisters, but he too was the youngest in his\nfamily and had three older siblings, so to speak, and he said so. Cory got up from the table and took a\nframed family photograph from the mantel. Showing it to Anden, he said, “My oldest sister’s the\nlawyer; she works in the federal Industry Department. Her husband’s an engineer; they don’t have\nkids, though. My second sister studied nursing; now she stays at home with her two little ones. The\nthird one—that’s her—she graduated with a degree in social work and got married just last year.”\nAll the Dauks bore family resemblance in the shape of their smiles and the broadness of their\nshoulders. Anden wanted to ask if any of Cory’s sisters were also Green Bones, but he’d made so\nmany cultural mistakes and wrong assumptions in Espenia so far that he was hesitant. If the people\nhere hid their jade, maybe it was rude to publicly ask if someone was a Green Bone. He studied the\nfamily photo appreciatively for another minute before handing it back to Cory.\n“Your younger son is still at Watersguard, isn’t he?” said Dauk Losunyin to the Hians. “How’s"

Is he still working on his doctorate?” The conversation between the four elders veered\ninto talk and sundry complaints about their grown children, then turned to gossip about neighbors in\nthe Kekonese parts of Southtrap. To Anden, it all seemed like talk that was far too common to be\nworth a Pillar’s attention, but Dauk Losun propped a heavy elbow on the table and listened with chin\non fist as Mrs. Hian bemoaned the increasing traffic in front of their house and expressed concern\nabout the couple across the street, the ones who were constantly fighting.\nDauk Sana had just cleared the dinner plates and brought out tea and a tin of Espenian biscuits\nwhen the doorbell rang. Cory opened it to admit a man who stepped inside and nodded in solemn\ngreeting to all of them. “Dauk-jens. Mr. and Mrs. Hian.” He looked at Anden but didn’t say anything.\nThe man took off his hat and coat and boots. He was wearing fine black leather gloves, and he took\nthese off as well, but instead of leaving them with his coat, he tucked them into his front shirt pocket\nas he joined them at the dining room table. Cory pulled over another chair and the man muttered a\nthanks, helping himself to a biscuit as Sana poured them all tea.\nThis newcomer was the first man Anden had met in Espenia that made him think: Fist. He was\nnot an especially large man, but everything in his manner—his sharp gaze, the way he stood and\nmoved and carried his lean frame—suggested the capacity for violence. Kaul Hilo had once told\nAnden that good Fists had the minds of guard dogs—they could be friendly, smiling and wagging\ntheir tails, but they were always alert. If you made a wrong move, if you threatened what they valued,\nthey wouldn’t hesitate to use their teeth. Without having ever met this person before, Anden\nrecognized him immediately as someone who would fit in alongside the Maik brothers.\n“I’m sorry I couldn’t join you for dinner,” said the man. His arrival signaled a shift in the\nevening; Anden suspected it had not been coincidence at all, but precisely timed. The idle chatter\nceased. Chairs scraped back slightly from the cleared table; cigarettes and hoji appeared.\n“Rohn-jen, you know you’re welcome anytime,” said Dauk Sana, but there was a subtle reserve\nin her voice that had not been there earlier. “How’s your shoulder feeling these days?”\nRohn said, “Much better after your healing sessions, Sana-jen.”\nDauk Losun gestured to Anden. “Toro, this is Emery Anden, a visiting student from Janloon.\nHe’s only half-Kekonese, but his mother was a powerful Green Bone and he was adopted into the\nKaul family of the No Peak clan as their youngest grandson.”\nAnden was taken aback.

Dauk Losunyin spoke in the same\nneighborly, casual tone he’d used all evening, as if Anden’s history was known to everyone, even\nthough that was clearly not true. Cory’s eyebrows rose. He sat back and cocked his head, looking at\nAnden with heightened interest.\nRohn Toro dipped a cinnamon biscuit into his teacup. “Kaul is a famous name,” he said.\n“Very famous,” Dauk Losun agreed, sitting back and rubbing his stomach with satisfaction after\nsuch a good meal. “I grew up in Kekon in a Green Bone family during the Shotarian occupation and\nwas always hearing stories of the brave leaders of the One Mountain Society. Ayt Yugontin and Kaul\nSeningtun—the Spear and the Torch. After my father killed a Shotarian policeman, the Society helped\nme and my mother and sisters to escape to Espenia. Those three weeks in the hold of a cargo ship\nwere the worst of my life. But gods be thanked, we arrived safely in our new country, with nothing\nbut the clothes on our backs. I was fourteen years old.” The Pillar gazed at Anden intently. “Young\nman, I tell you this so you understand that I have the highest respect for your family. I make it my\nbusiness to know what happens in this neighborhood, so when Mr. and Mrs. Hian called to say they\nwere bringing you to meet me, of course I had to ask some questions and find out more about you.\nNow that I know who you are, my family and I want to help you in whatever way we can.”\n“Thank you, Dauk-jen,” Anden said, trying to recover from the sudden change in both Dauk and\nthe tone of the conversation. He was still not sure what to expect from this unassuming Pillar, the\nsnug family dinner, the house decorated with false jade.\n“Anden-se, tell them what happened,” urged Mrs. Hian.\nAfter Anden told them of his violent encounter in the park, Dauk turned to Rohn Toro. “You\nknow of this Carson Sunter?”\n“He’s a coat for Skinny Reams.” Rohn said the word coat and the name Skinny Reams in\nEspenian. “Boss Kromner wouldn’t bother himself over a small thing like this, but Reams might take\nissue.”\nMr. and Mrs. Hian looked deeply concerned. “Dauk-jen, the Crews have no principles at all,”\nMrs. Hian exclaimed. “Might they come after our home, or even our sons?”\nAnden was entirely lost and increasingly alarmed. “That man I fought—who is he?”\nTo his surprise, Cory answered. “You didn’t know any better than to get into a scrap with a\ncrewboy? They’re gangsters, you know. Boss Kromner runs all the gambling, extortion, drug dealing,\nand racketeering on the whole south side of Port Massy, and Willum ‘Skinny’ Reams is his number\none foreman. That man you beat up, Carson Sunter, is a coat—a foot soldier in Kromner’s Crew. Not\nvery high up, mind you—the sort of guy who shakes down businesses and carries drug money. But"

Not\nvery high up, mind you—the sort of guy who shakes down businesses and carries drug money. But\nthe foreman Reams—he might see a Kekonese thrashing a local as something else.”\n“Those crooks, they prey on anyone weaker, especially immigrants,” said Mr. Hian. “But they\nleave our Kekonese neighborhoods alone because we have Dauk-jen as Pillar and Green Bones with\njade to protect us. That’s why you don’t see them in our part of Southtrap.”\n“We have something of an understanding with the Crews. They stay out of our business, and we\nstay out of theirs,” Dauk Losun explained. “But I’m afraid things will change as soon as civilian\npossession of jade is made illegal.”\nHis words caused a ripple of consternation to go around the small table. Dauk Sana muttered a\nprofanity under her breath. Her husband held up a calming hand. “We might as well accept it.\nThere’ve been too many publicized stories of irresponsible usage, cases of the Itches, and now this\nswell of interest in jade because of the military involvement in Oortoko. The legislation to ban jade is\nalready in the National Assembly and has the backing of the premier and the biggest Trade Societies.\nIt’s a foregone conclusion that it’ll pass.”\nThe Pillar reached under the collar of his flannel shirt and pulled out a circular jade pendant on a\nsilver chain. He kissed the jade disc and said to Anden, “This is our Kekonese heritage. My family\nhas worn jade for generations. Today, it keeps our people safe from the Crews and anyone else that\nwould take advantage of us; it binds our community and is part of our identity as Keko-Espenians.\nNow the government tells me it’s against the law? It’s the law that’s wrong.”\nHis wife nodded in vehement agreement. “I may not be a doctor, but I was trained as a nurse\nback in Kekon and I learned enough medical Channeling from my mother to help people who come\nto me with problems. Now, because of this ridiculous law, they will be afraid of getting involved in\nsomething illegal, even though they’ve been coming for years.” As he had with the other Dauks,\nAnden tried to determine where Cory’s mother wore her jade but could not.\nDauk Losun dropped the pendant back under his shirt, out of sight. “The only thing this\nupcoming ban will accomplish is to make the Crews hungry for jade of their own. I can tell it’s\nalready happening; they expect a piece of any black market business in Port Massy. They’re already\ninto drugs, so naturally they’ll want the shine trade too. It won’t be long before we have to contend\nwith the Crews targeting us for what we have.”\nDauk Sana blew out sharply. “That day isn’t here yet. Let’s not get off track. Anden and the\nHians came to us for help, and we can’t let this silly misunderstanding cause problems for any of\nthem. Let’s ask Rohn-jen to go to Skinny Reams with”—she considered for a moment—“two\nthousand thalirs. I would say we can go up to three thousand, but not more.”"

I would say we can go up to three thousand, but not more.”\nThe Pillar nodded. “As usual, my wife’s smarter than I am. It’s a good thing I have her to keep\nme focused these days. Toro, you should bring two of your greenest friends with you, and if Reams\ntries to bargain for higher, remind them that we know all about the Gerting job and have said nothing\nto the police. Three thousand and our continued silence—they’ll accept that.”\nAnden stared around the table. He felt caught in the clutch of two simultaneous epiphanies. The\nfirst was that he had not, contrary to his own initial beliefs and those of his cousins, come to a land\ndevoid of jade and clans after all. In Janloon, the question of who would control jade had led to open\nbloodshed in the streets between No Peak and the Mountain; here it was just beginning, simmering in\nthe Espenian underworld and the shadows of immigrant communities, but it existed nonetheless.\nThe second realization fell into place as he looked from Dauk to his wife, to the stranger Rohn.\nThis small family dining table was a far cry from the formal study in the Kaul house or the top floor\nof the tower on Ship Street, but Anden understood now that he was looking at a Green Bone Pillar, his\nWeather Man, and his Horn. In Port Massy, they were something different than in Janloon. Simple\npeople in the community, neighbors secretly helping neighbors.\nHe glanced at Cory. The young man soon to be a lawyer was leaned back with his chair tipped\nagainst the wall, one leg drawn up on the seat, still paying some attention to the conversation but\nseemingly more interested in his handful of jam-filled biscuits. Cory was smooth-skinned and tall and\nhad strong calves from biking. He wore a T-shirt with the logo of what Anden presumed was a\npopular music band and seemed in all ways to be very Espenian. But he was a Green Bone; he wore\njade somewhere on his body and had been trained to use it. What was his place in the clan?\nRohn Toro finished his tea and got up. “I’ll find Reams and talk to him.”\n“Thank you, old friend,” said Dauk Losun, standing up as well and seeing him to the door.\n“Also, sometime soon, it would be a good idea for you to pay a friendly visit to Tim Joro. What\nhappens between a man and his wife is his own business, but when it becomes a known problem in\nthe neighborhood that could bring the police—well, that becomes a bigger issue affecting everyone.\nBe sure to remind him of that, will you?”\nRohn nodded and left the house. As Dauk Sana pressed a casserole dish of leftovers into Mrs.\nHian’s hands, Mr. Hian gathered their jackets and again saluted deeply to the Pillar. “Dauk-jen, we\ncan’t thank you enough for taking care of this problem for us. May the gods shine favor on you.”\n“Don’t worry,” said Dauk. “Rohn Toro is completely reliable, and we’ve had to deal with the\nCrews before.

I admire your thick\nblood, though, standing up for yourself and refusing to be talked down to by anyone.

He was still reeling from\neverything that had happened. “Dauk-jen, are you sure this will work to smooth things over?” He was\nmost concerned about the Hians; he couldn’t bear to think he’d put them in any danger.\n“Well, there’s never any guarantee, but you should put it out of your mind,” said the Pillar.\n“There’s a saying, you know: When there’s a problem to be solved, the Espenian tries money first,\nthen resorts to violence. The Kekonese tries violence first, then resorts to money.” Dauk Losun\nchuckled. It was clearly a phrase he’d quoted before because his wife and son rolled their eyes behind\nhis back. “We’re in Espenia, so in the same way the Hians are your foster parents here, allow me to\nact as a friend to you and your family.”\nAnden nodded in thanks but felt a creeping worry. He had a strong suspicion that the Pillar of\nSouthtrap, though he might be a warm and genuine man, was extending his assistance not just out of\naffection for the Hians, but because of Anden’s association with the Kaul family. Might he not expect\nthat at some point, friendship and favor would be returned by the No Peak clan? He would be sorely\ndisappointed if Anden could not provide any reciprocation.\nAnden chose his words carefully. “Dauk-jen, you have my gratitude. I’m a stranger in this\ncountry and have only gotten by thanks to the generosity of those in the Kekonese community. I only\nwish I could speak on behalf of my cousins as well, but I’m afraid I don’t hold any status in the No\nPeak clan—that’s why I was sent away from Janloon to begin with. I’m not a Green Bone myself, but\nI hope that one day my friendship will be worth something more than it is now.”\nThe Pillar seemed not in the least disappointed by this candid admission. Perhaps, in finding out\nmore about Anden in advance of this evening, he’d learned everything there was to know and was\nalready aware of Anden’s role in the clan war and his subsequent disgrace. He extended his large,\nrough hand and as Anden shook it, he said, “A well-spoken young man like you? I’d bet on it. Things\nchange. Circumstances exiled me and my family to Espenia as well, but I have no regrets.”\nCHAPTER\n18\nThe White Lantern Club\nS\nhae arrived at the White Lantern Club twenty minutes before her scheduled meeting with the"

        "text": "CHAPTER\n18\nThe White Lantern Club\nS\nhae arrived at the White Lantern Club twenty minutes before her scheduled meeting with the\nEspenian ambassador and the commander of Euman Naval Base. She wanted to secure one of the best\ntables and to position herself as host before the foreign guests arrived. She asked the hoji master to\nbring up two recommended labels from the cellar as well as a bottle of imported wine and to place\nthem in the center of the table. A few of the club’s members noticed her arrival and looked intent on\ncoming up to pay their respects. Woon went around to greet them and deftly head off any possible\nattempts to initiate conversation, explaining that the Weather Man was here on important business and\nunfortunately could not be distracted right now, but he would be glad to carry their regards to her.\nShae went into the restroom to check her makeup and wash her hands, which felt clammy. She\nwas wearing a bold red skirt and blazer, cut in an Espenian style with wide lapels and cuffed sleeves,\nand a high-necked white blouse that hid her jade bracelets and choker. Her earrings were the only\nvisible green. She took out two folded pieces of paper from the inside pocket of her blazer and\nreviewed them. A few important economic and political facts and figures, gathered after talking to\nMaro. A page of strategy notes written to herself during a recent working session with Woon. She\nstowed the papers. She was well armed, but still felt as if she were going into battle on disadvantaged\nterms.\nShe returned to the table. Ambassador Gregor Mendoff and Colonel Leland Deiller arrived at the\nsame time five minutes later. Shae stood to greet them and shake their hands. “Ambassador. Colonel.\nI’m glad you could join me this afternoon.” The words came reasonably smoothly; Shae had spent\nmuch of the past two weeks with the radio in her office tuned to the Espenian station and several\nhours talking to herself in Espenian, refreshing her memory of the language she’d had limited\noccasion to use since returning home from Windton. She spoke more slowly and deliberately than\nusual not only to minimize her accent, but to set the tone of the meeting. She did not introduce Woon\nor the other man she had with her, a translator that she hoped not to have to call upon. She assumed\nher guests would be familiar enough with Kekonese business custom to understand that this meant\nthey were observers only and would not be active participants in the discussion.\nShae exchanged pleasantries with the men for a few minutes as the waiter brought out tea and\nappetizer plates of shrimp cake and pickled figs. Ambassador Mendoff complained about the humid\nweather, and Colonel Deiller, not having been in this room before, commented upon the breadth of\npremium liquor displayed on the wall behind the bar. The White Lantern Club was an unabashedly\nopulent place: stuffed red leather chairs, glass chandeliers, expensive artwork on the walls,\nimpeccable servers in black waistcoats. Membership was by invitation only and had until recently\nbeen extended exclusively to No Peak Lantern Men of a certain level and standing, as one of the most\ncoveted status perks granted by the clan. Women were admitted for the first time five years ago. The\nfollowing year, membership by application was opened to those who were not strictly No Peak\nbusiness executives, including councilmen, prominent Janloon writers and artists, and Kaul Dushuron"

        "text": "following year, membership by application was opened to those who were not strictly No Peak\nbusiness executives, including councilmen, prominent Janloon writers and artists, and Kaul Dushuron\nAcademy faculty members. Now there was even limited reciprocal membership privileges with the\nJanloon City Club on the other side of the Financial District, which had long been the old boys’ social\nclub of the Mountain clan. Even during the recent period of clan war, money was more fluid than\nblood. The Green Bones of the two clans might be deadly enemies, but their tribute-paying\nbusinessmen remained able to network over drinks at elite establishments.\n“I trust that you gentlemen have heard the good news,” Shae said, once the appetizers had been\ncleared and the soup and meat dishes brought out. Espenians, Shae had learned, did not typically wait\nuntil after the meal to begin important conversations. “The government suspension on jade mining\nhas been lifted and mining operations resumed, which means that Kekon will soon begin fulfilling its\nregular export contracts.”\n“Yes, welcome news indeed,” said Ambassador Mendoff. The ambassador was a bulky man with\na gray mustache and congenial blue eyes. He seemed, Shae thought, to be a little bemused by her; he\nkept angling his wide shoulders slightly to the side, glancing at Woon on occasion. Mendoff was the\nformer president of the powerful Shipworkers Society and had been in the ambassadorial post for six\nmonths, a reward for his enormous campaign contributions to the current premier of the Espenian\nNational Assembly. He cleared his throat. “And may I add that this comes at a vital time, Miss Kaul.\nConsidering the political instability caused by the civil war in Oortoko, my government sees our trade\nagreements with Kekon as one of the primary means of promoting security in the region.”\nShae smiled at the man politely but firmly. “Ambassador, here in Kekon, the proper form of\naddress for a person who carries jade is jen. You may address me as Kaul-jen, or simply as Weather\nMan, which is a term that sounds strange to you, perhaps, but means a great deal in my culture.”\nMendoff flushed and looked uncomfortable, but Shae continued as if there had been no\nawkwardness. “I appreciate that ongoing jade exports are of considerable interest to you.” She\ninclined her head to Colonel Deiller. “After all, experts say the conflict in Oortoko is poised to\nbecome the first modern jade war.”\nColonel Deiller had a square face, assertive eyebrows, and the long-suffering dignity of a career\nmilitary officer who’d been posted to a dozen places in the world and seen every form of bullshit\nthere was to see. He regarded Shae with an intensely evaluative gaze, one that made her feel faintly\nuneasy. She suspected the man was flipping through his mental dossier, comparing her to photographs\nfrom many years ago, when she’d acted as an informant to the ROE’s intelligence service. She’d been\ntwenty-two at the time, the girlfriend of a Republic of Espenia naval officer, spoiled granddaughter of\nthe famous war hero Kaul Seningtun. Perhaps the colonel was wondering how, in seven short years,\nshe had become one of the most influential political and business figures on the island of Kekon.\n“Our objective in Oortoko is to provide support to the Shotarian government.” Deiller’s voice"

        "text": "she had become one of the most influential political and business figures on the island of Kekon.\n“Our objective in Oortoko is to provide support to the Shotarian government.” Deiller’s voice\nhad a heavy northern Espenian accent that Shae recognized from her graduate school years in\nWindton. “We’re deploying military assets at their request.”\n“You were quick to amass naval forces in the West Tun Sea as soon as you suspected the\nYgutanian military was equipping the Oortokon rebels,” Shae pointed out.\n“The ROE’s policy is to combat any Ygutanian aggression, and it’s abundantly clear that the\nrebellion in Oortoko is a vehicle for Ygutan to extend its territory.” Deiller eyed the squid dish\nsuspiciously and reached for the pork instead. “The premier and the secretary of the War Department\nhave stated that we’ll unequivocally defend the sovereignty of our allies.” He gave her a pointed look.\n“Including Kekon, I might add.”\nShae motioned to the server to refill the small cups of hoji. The ambassador had finished his first\nserving, the colonel had not. Shae had only tasted hers. “I’m sorry to say that many Kekonese don’t\nsee the rapid military buildup on Euman Island and in our surrounding waters as the actions of a\ntrusted ally.”\n“I’ve spoken at length with Chancellor Son Tomarho,” said Ambassador Mendoff, managing to\nsound indignant at Shae’s suggestion while still retaining the smooth tone of a diplomat. “I’ve assured\nhim and the Royal Council that our heightened military presence on Kekon is a necessary and, we\nhope, temporary measure in our joint security interests.”\n“Jade is in your interest,” Shae clarified, setting down her soup spoon. “We all watch the news,\nAmbassador. Stories of Espenian special operations teams equipped with Kekonese jade… that makes\npeople very nervous. You must remember that my country has a long history of foreigners trying to\ninvade and occupy us. How can we trust that our Espenian allies are any different? If you wanted to,\ncould you not use your military might and jade-wearing soldiers to take over our mines for yourselves\nand control our country?” Shae opened her hands in a helpless gesture, as if she was only giving\nvoice to a ridiculous paranoia, but she was certain Mendoff and Deiller had been in conversations of\nthat very nature with their superiors. If No Peak hadn’t kept jade flowing to Adamont Capita during\nthe KJA shutdown, or if the clan war had continued and forced the mines to remain inactive too long,\nthe Espenians might indeed have taken military action. She said, “Don’t be offended; I’m only telling\nyou how the Kekonese mind works. We are always on guard against theft.”\n“It seems you’re already aware of our request to the Royal Council,” grumbled Ambassador\nMendoff. “Nothing in this country escapes the notice of you clan people.”\nShae said, “Asking for such a significant increase in jade exports as soon as the mines begin\nrunning again, while at the same time you amass forces in our territory, is not going to cause Espenia\nto be viewed favorably by anyone on Kekon. The Royal Council is already under severe pressure\nfrom the public to reduce jade exports and condemn the Oortokon War.”"

        "text": "to be viewed favorably by anyone on Kekon. The Royal Council is already under severe pressure\nfrom the public to reduce jade exports and condemn the Oortokon War.”\n“Shotar is in a crisis situation,” the ambassador insisted, leaning forward for emphasis, “and\nYgutan is a clear and present threat to us all. Kekon is geopolitically important not only as the world’s\nsole source of bioenergetic jade, but because of its strategic position in the West Tun Sea. We require\nyour country’s full support.”\n“You will not get additional jade,” Shae said. “Neither the members in the Royal Council nor the\nclan representatives that sit on the board of the Kekon Jade Alliance will agree to surrender more of\nthe country’s reserves to a foreign proxy war.”\nAmbassador Mendoff sat back and frowned. “Excuse me, Miss Kaul-jen, but you don’t speak for\nthe Kekonese government.”\n“That’s true,” Shae said. “You will have to wait for the official answer. It will be the same as the\nunofficial one that you’re hearing from me now. We have a saying in Kekon: ‘Gold and jade, never\ntogether.’ Those of us who wear jade don’t hold political office, but you’re not asking for gold—\nyou’re asking for jade. In that, the clans have the final say.”\nShae hoped that the two men picked up on the subtle reminder: Kekon might be a small island\nwith an undersized national army, but any attempt to exert military control over the country would\nmean contending with the Green Bone clans, which controlled the cities and all major industries and\nwhose membership included thousands of trained fighters each wearing more jade than several elite\nEspenian soldiers put together.\nThe Weather Man said, “Allow me to explain, so you can communicate to your superiors: It’s\nnot that we disagree with your stance against Ygutan. But in Kekon, we believe that jade is a divine\ngift from Heaven. A person must train for many years beginning in childhood before they can wear it,\nand it is our sacred tradition that it be wielded only by those who defend others. Of course,” she\nadded, “we recognize the world has opened up and we are no longer the only ones who can possess\njade, but nevertheless, it is central to our national identity. There is a large Keko-Shotarian population\nin Oortoko; they and other civilians will be caught in this conflict. We don’t want jade to become\nknown as a tool of war for foreigners, one that might even be used to harm fellow ethnic Kekonese.”\n“You’re suggesting that it’ll somehow tarnish Kekon’s reputation and the sanctity of jade for it to\nbe used by military personnel in an armed conflict?” Ambassador Mendoff said skeptically. “Disputes\nbetween the clans in this country have resulted in people wearing jade killing each other with swords\nin the streets of Janloon. So where’s the logic in your argument?”\nShae spoke calmly but with a cold edge in her voice. “The two things you describe are entirely\ndifferent. If you cannot see why, it is because you are not Kekonese.”\nThe two men looked disgruntled.

        "text": "The two men looked disgruntled. The server came to clear their empty plates; Mendoff and\nDeiller glanced somewhat apologetically at the men beside Shae, who had not eaten or drunk\nanything from the meal. The translator, a junior Luckbringer in the clan, could not help looking at the\nleftover food hungrily as it was taken back to the kitchen. Woon, who knew well enough to have\neaten his fill elsewhere before the meeting, did not spare the dishes a glance.\nShae waited for the server to finish pouring tea, then added in a more conciliatory tone, “Do not\nthink, however, that this means we do not support our allies. Jade is a national resource that must be\nmanaged by all of Kekon, but I would speak to you now, not as a board member of the KJA, but as\nWeather Man of my clan. We can offer other things of value to you besides jade.” For the first time,\nshe turned toward Woon, who immediately handed her a thick manila envelope.\nShae set the envelope down in the center of the table and observed that Colonel Deiller reached\nout to take it first. He removed the papers within and began to examine them. As he read, his\neyebrows drew together, and though his face kept its gruff composure, his pulse quickened enough\nfor Shae to Perceive. He handed the papers wordlessly to Ambassador Mendoff, who, after a few\nminutes of study, rubbed his mustache and looked up at Shae. “How did you get this?”\nShae had searched Doru’s files for the information he’d compiled after his trip to Ygutan on\nLan’s orders two years ago. She’d questioned the Fist and the Finger who’d corroborated the report\non the Mountain’s activities in that country, and with Maik Kehn’s permission, sent them back to\nYgutan for four weeks, along with two of her own people, to verify and update their findings.\nShae asked Deiller, “Has the cormorant ever provided you with false information?”\nThe colonel’s eyes narrowed at the use of her old code name. “No,” he admitted.\nTheir table was discreetly partitioned from the rest of the dining floor by a wooden screen, and\nWoon had seen to it that the dining floor staff did not seat any other patrons within earshot, but\nnevertheless, Ambassador Mendoff lowered his voice. “This is evidence of large-scale SN1\nproduction in Ygutan.”\n“With ample SN1, if Ygutan can secure jade on the black market, they can use it for military\npurposes, including equipping their puppet militia in Oortoko.”\nBoth men appeared noticeably discomfited by the idea. Mendoff asked Deiller, “Why haven’t\nour assets in the Ygutanian government told us about this?” he asked Deiller.\n“Your spies embedded in Dramsk probably aren’t aware of it,” Shae said. “The SN1 production\nfacilities aren’t being run by the Ygutanian government. As much as we Kekonese oppose shine\ntrafficking in our own country, there are some people—in clans other than my own—who have no\nproblem producing it and selling it to anyone who will pay, regardless of political alliance.”\nEven before the clan war, Lan had anticipated that No Peak could use information about the"

        "text": "problem producing it and selling it to anyone who will pay, regardless of political alliance.”\nEven before the clan war, Lan had anticipated that No Peak could use information about the\nMountain’s overseas SN1 manufacturing operations to damage their enemies—and that was precisely\nwhat Shae intended to do. She took the sheaf of papers and put them back in the envelope, then put a\nhand on top of it and looked at the two men with her eyebrows expectantly raised. “Despite our\ndiffering views and priorities, the No Peak clan wishes for our countries to remain friends, which is\nwhy I asked you here today for an honest conversation and to offer you something of value.”\nThe two men across the table glanced at each other, apparently coming to some silent, terse\nagreement between them before turning back to her. “I would have to make some calls to Adamont\nCapita,” said Ambassador Mendoff slowly, “but you’ve done us a great service by sharing this\ninformation. It would be worth perhaps ten to fifteen million thalirs to us.”\nShae managed to hide a grimace at the sudden blunt mention of price. The Espenians were a\nmercenary, plutocratic people; their society was built on a long history of naval power and trade, and\nthey treated fair commerce like a religion. They could put a price on anything, Shae suspected,\ncertainly jade, maybe even life and death.\nShe leaned back and drank some tea, pretending to consider the ambassador’s offer; they would\nlikely be offended if she did not appear to take it seriously. “Clans in Kekon have a tradition,” she\nsaid at last. “When an outsider has done something for us out of respect and goodwill, we give them a\ngift. It must be an item that’s green, marked with the symbol of the clan. It means that we’re grateful\nfor their friendship, and if there’s any way we can help them in the future, we’ll do so.”\nDeiller shifted in his chair; Mendoff coughed. The idea of favors and indebtedness clearly made\nthem uncomfortable. The ambassador said skeptically, “That’s what you’d like in exchange for\ninformation of military importance?”\nShae smiled. “No, no, that isn’t your custom, so of course I wouldn’t expect you to follow it. The\nwhole point of the gift is that there is no specific date or value tied to it. It’s meant to symbolize\nappreciation and trust. But I don’t need a symbolic token, and I wouldn’t expect you to accept an\nexchange that’s so undefined. I only bring it up because I would like this to be an opportunity for us\nto improve the bond between our countries. We are allies, as you say, but because of what’s\nhappening now, the relationship is strained. If we build bridges—profitable bridges—it would go a\nlong way in strengthening our alliance and public perception of Espenia.”\nAmbassador Mendoff nodded slowly. His broad shoulders and pale blue eyes were squared\ntoward her now. “You have some particular opportunities in mind?”\n“There are many Kekonese companies that would like to gain access to the Espenian market. For\nthat to happen, tariffs would need to be reduced or eliminated in certain industries such as textiles and\nconsumer products. I’d like to see restrictions on foreign real estate investment in cities such as Port\nMassy be lifted so more Kekonese businesses can operate there.” She decided it was best to speak as"

        "text": "consumer products. I’d like to see restrictions on foreign real estate investment in cities such as Port\nMassy be lifted so more Kekonese businesses can operate there.” She decided it was best to speak as\nfrankly as they had. “Since the end of the Many Nations War, Kekon has been opening itself up to\ninternational trade, but if you subtract our primary export to Espenia—jade—we’re running a\nsubstantial trade deficit. In order to correct that, and to expand business opportunities for Kekonese\ncompanies, I would need your support.”\nAmbassador Mendoff and Colonel Deiller regarded her silently for several seconds. At last the\ncolonel said, “Well, I’m a soldier, not a politician, but I will say that Kekon is the strategic linchpin of\nour military presence in the East Amaric. We’re committed to our alliance and maintaining good\nrelations with the government and people of this country.”\n“Be that as it may,” said Ambassador Mendoff, “what you’re hoping for isn’t the sort of thing\nthat can be accomplished quickly or easily. You might be well advised to accept fifteen million thalirs.\nI can advocate your issues with Premier Galtz and the National Assembly, but…”\n“That’s all I ask.” Shae added a calculated touch of humble flattery into her voice. “I know that\nyou’re friends with the premier and have great influence on him, or so I’m told by everyone I speak\nto. If you’re able to put in a word at the highest level that might improve our joint economic future,\nI’ll gladly take it in place of anything else you could offer me.”\n“You act as if you’re the final authority in this discussion, Miss Kaul-jen.” Ambassador Mendoff\nlooked uneasy. “Where’s the leader of your clan? Why isn’t he here?”\nBecause, Shae thought, Hilo would rather do anything else but sit in the White Lantern Club\ncozying up to foreign diplomats. “I have full authority to act as the Pillar’s representative in these\nmatters,” Shae said. “My word in the No Peak clan is final.”\nCHAPTER\n19\nReunion in Lybon\nW\nhen Hilo arrived in Lybon, Stepenland, he was surprised by how clean everything was. The inter-\nterminal airport shuttle was a punctual, silver capsule that announced arrivals and departures in\nStepenish, Espenian, and another language that was probably Lurmish. The temperature was mild,\nalmost cool, even in late summer. The people weren’t unfriendly, but they seemed curt, pale, and\nefficient.\nHilo decided he would like to be able to drive around and see the city, so Tar rented a blue coupe\nfrom the airport car rental counter. While his Pillarman studied the map, Hilo got directions from the\nrental agent by showing her the address they needed to reach and having a conversation using the\nlimited Espenian vocabulary that he possessed. When they eventually got on the road, it turned out to\nbe easy to navigate Lybon. Compared to Janloon, the city was more like a large town, divided into\nfour quadrants and bisected north-south by the Farstgein River. The blue outline of craggy mountains\nrose in the west, and picturesque tall brick houses with pointy roofs lined the wide streets, flowers\nspilling from the garden boxes of iron balconies.

The sidewalks were narrow but bordered by\nimmaculately trimmed green hedges and leafy trees.\nTar suggested they go to the hotel first, but Hilo shook his head; he’d slept on the plane and\nwhenever possible he preferred to get on with whatever needed to be done.\nThe address turned out to be a quaint, single-story pastel green house in the northwest quarter of\nLybon. Tar parked the car along the street. When they rang the doorbell, it opened almost at once.\nEyni must’ve been expecting someone else, perhaps a delivery or a repairman, because she began to\nsay something before she realized who was standing in front of her. Lan’s ex-wife took an involuntary\nstep back, her eyes widening.\nHilo smiled and stepped across the threshold into the house. “Sister Eyni,” he said warmly, “I’m\nsorry for not calling ahead to let you know we were coming, but I didn’t have any Stepenish coins for\nthe pay phone in the airport. I hope we’re not showing up at a bad time.” Hilo shut the front door\nbehind Tar. “This is Maik Tar, I don’t know if you remember him; he was my Second Fist when I was\nHorn and now he’s my Pillarman.”\n“What are you doing here?” Eyni’s voice came out high. “How did you find out where I live?”\n“It’s easy to find those things out.” It was not worth mentioning that he’d tracked her down years\nago, but at Lan’s direction, had never acted on the information. Eyni had changed somewhat; her face\nhad not aged, but having a child had added to her hips and she’d cut her hair to chin-length.\nHilo took off his jacket and laid it across the back of a chair. He said, “Going back and forth by\nmail isn’t the best way to talk about important things. You have to take the time to write it all down,\nthen wait for weeks before you get a reply. By then, you’ve practically forgotten what you said\nbefore. And when you can’t see the other person, it’s easy for there to be misunderstandings. For\nexample, I know you didn’t mean to be rude to Wen, even though it came across that way on paper.\nSo I thought: Instead of putting you to the trouble of planning a big trip to Janloon, which I know can\nbe hard when you have a little kid, I’ll come talk to you in person.”\nEyni’s eyes darted from Hilo to the door. “Lors will be home any minute.”\n“Good,” said Hilo. “Then we can all sit down together and be properly introduced.” He looked\naround the living room curiously. It was a small but bright space that smelled of floral air freshener.\nEyni had always liked art; there were clay masks and small square watercolors on the walls and a\nwicker bowl on the coffee table that held fruits made out of felt, as well as, incongruously, a bright\ngreen plastic rattle in the shape of a frog. Eyni was trying to appear calm, but he could Perceive her\nheart beating, her distrust blaring like a red siren, and it irritated him. There were times when it was"

There were times when it was\nuseful to inspire fear, when he needed to do so, but when he had no intention to frighten, the reaction\nwas a bit offensive. He sat down on the sofa and, with a glance, bade Tar to do the same. Hilo picked\nup the rattle. “Where’s my nephew?”\n“He’s napping,” Eyni said quickly, but at that moment, a noise came from another room and Hilo\ngot up to see a toddler standing and clutching the white metal rails of a baby gate at the end of the\nhall. Hilo went to the child and crouched down on his knees. The two-year-old barely resembled the\nplump baby in the photograph Wen had shown him; now he had the features of a Kaul—the nose and\nmouth, the watchful eyes. Hilo could already tell that he would grow up to be the spitting image of\nLan, in the same way that Lan had resembled their father. That seemed to be the way it was, with\nfirstborn Kaul sons. The boy stared at Hilo with great interest, entirely unafraid. His left eye squinted\nslightly and he reached through the bars of the gate with a chubby hand. Hilo, entranced, put his hand\nout to the child, who grasped his fingers.\n“Hello, Niko,” said the Pillar. “I’m your uncle Hilo.”\nEyni pushed past him and took the rattle as she opened the gate and picked up Nikolas, who\ngave a squeal of protest as she shushed him and carried him back into the nursery. The boy squirmed\nand reached out over his mother’s shoulder as he was taken away.\nA sudden and all-consuming protectiveness seized Hilo. He’d only just met the child, but now he\nregretted that he hadn’t come earlier. He should’ve come as soon as Wen had shown him the letter\nand not waited. He almost reached out to seize Eyni’s arm, to prevent her from hurrying Niko away\nmere seconds after he’d finally laid eyes on the boy.\nEyni disappeared into the other room, then reemerged a minute later, closing the door behind her.\n“He should be sleeping,” she explained. “He’s been fighting naps lately. If he gets too excited, he\nwon’t settle down and then he’ll be cranky this evening.” She led the way back down the hall without\nlooking at her former brother-in-law. Hilo followed at something of a distance. Once in the living\nroom again, he said, with a greater sense of determination, “We need to talk, Eyni. It’s true we didn’t\nuse to be friends; maybe I wasn’t ever really like a brother to you and you weren’t ever really like a\nsister to me, but that’s not important now. We have to think about what’s best for Niko. We need to\ntalk about you returning to Janloon.”\nEyni was facing away from him, her back rigid. When she turned around, her arms were crossed\nand her expression was tight with suppressed anger and stubborn resolve. “You shouldn’t have come\nhere, Hilo,” she said. “I told your wife not to contact me again, and I didn’t respond to your last two\nletters for a reason. I’ve put the past behind me.”"

        "text": "here, Hilo,” she said. “I told your wife not to contact me again, and I didn’t respond to your last two\nletters for a reason. I’ve put the past behind me.”\nHilo’s face twisted in a flash of annoyance. “You wrote to Lan. I saw the letter; you said you\nwanted your son to know his father and you were willing to move back to Kekon.”\n“That was two years ago,” Eyni exclaimed. “I hadn’t been in Lybon for long, and after Niko was\nborn, I felt so alone and unsure about everything. I still loved and missed Lan, but then I learned\nthrough friends—friends, because no one in the clan even bothered to tell me—that he was dead.\nMurdered. In some ridiculous Green Bone war that had taken over the whole city.”\n“You’d left the family,” Hilo said, without sympathy. “That’s why you weren’t told.”\n“Yes,” Eyni said quietly. “It took me some time, but I finally did leave. I have a life here with\nLors now. We have a home and friends. We’ve no reason to go back to Kekon.”\n“No reason?” Hilo was flabbergasted, but he forced himself to take several seconds to compose a\nreply; he knew that his temper could sometimes cause him to say things that could not be unsaid. In\nas patient a voice as he could manage, he said, “I admit I don’t know much about Lybon, but I know\nit’s no place to raise a Green Bone. There are hardly any Kekonese people here. What kind of life\ncould Niko possibly have in Stepenland? He’ll always be an outsider. He needs to grow up in\nJanloon, where his family is.”\n“Lors and I are his family,” Eyni replied.\n“This man, your boyfriend, he’s not Kekonese. And is he really willing to raise a child that isn’t\nhis? Are you even married?”\nEyni’s eyes flashed with indignation. “What does that matter? We’re committed to each other\nand to raising children together.”\nHilo was silent for a minute. “All right,” he said at last. “I see how it is. Let’s sit down to talk;\nthere’s no need to get angry at each other from across the room.” He went to Eyni slowly, as if\napproaching a skittish horse, and taking her elbow, led her toward the sofa. He sat down and though\nshe extricated her arm from his grasp, she did as he wished and sat down next to him. Hilo said, in a\nmuch gentler voice, “I think you probably remember me as Lan’s kid brother. I was quite a bit\nyounger than he was, and it’s true that I didn’t always have the best judgment. Who really does, at\nthat age? But a lot has changed in the years since you left Kekon. I’m the Pillar of the clan now, and\nthat means that when I make a decision, it’ll be followed.\n“You left Janloon under not the best of circumstances, and you’ve grown used to this foreign\ncountry, so I can appreciate you’re reluctant to return. And you want to stay with your boyfriend, I\nunderstand that.” He leaned forward to look into her downcast face. “Here’s what I can promise: You"

        "text": "country, so I can appreciate you’re reluctant to return. And you want to stay with your boyfriend, I\nunderstand that.” He leaned forward to look into her downcast face. “Here’s what I can promise: You\nand your family will have a good life in Janloon, better than what you have here. The clan will make\nall the arrangements. You’ll have a house, on or off the Kaul estate—it’s your choice. A car and\ndriver, a housekeeper, a nanny for Niko, and whatever else you need. Once you’re married in Janloon,\nI’ll welcome your husband into the family. He’s lived in Kekon before. Does he still work in tourism?\nThere’re plenty of foreigners in Janloon these days, and more international companies than ever\nbefore. It won’t be a problem to find him a good job; he’ll probably have his pick.” Of course, Hilo\nhad no intention of ever bringing Eyni’s foreign lover into No Peak, but he supposed he could learn to\ntolerate the man’s presence in Janloon, so long as their interactions were infrequent. It was an issue he\nwas willing to compromise on, since Eyni was the sort of person who would need companionship,\nand no respectable Kekonese man was going to have her.\nWhile she was contemplating his assurances, Hilo said, “Tar, why don’t you get us all something\nto drink.” The Pillarman, who’d been sitting back and watching the exchange, got up and went into\nthe galley kitchen. Eyni looked up anxiously and made a slight movement as if to follow him, but\nthen seemed to think better of it. She settled back and twisted her hands together in her lap. Hilo said,\n“There’s something else to consider: My wife, Wen, is pregnant. She’s due in less than two months.\nNiko will have cousins close to his age. He’ll have aunts and uncles who love him, and in Janloon,\nhe’ll grow up as a Kaul, as the first son of No Peak.” He gestured to Eyni’s house and its\nsurroundings. “Is this place so much better that it’s worth giving up your son’s birthright? Worth\nabandoning your home country?”\nTar returned with two glasses of water. Eyni’s hands trembled slightly as she took a glass\nwithout looking and drained it quickly. Hilo could tell that his last words had struck a chord. Eyni\nmight be a woman without much depth, but on some level, he knew she must be homesick. She\nwouldn’t have left Kekon on her own if it hadn’t been for the affair and the divorce, and now that\nHilo was offering the forgiveness of the clan and a return to a life of status back in Janloon, it wasn’t\nhard to Perceive the internal war raging inside her. He drank some water and waited.\nEyni held tight to the empty glass. “It’s true there’re things I don’t like about Lybon and things I\nmiss dearly about Janloon,” she admitted at last. “But the life you’re offering—life in the ruling\nGreen Bone family of No Peak—it’s what broke me and Lan apart. It’s what got him killed. It’s\nnothing but steel and jade and blood. It’s not a safe or happy life… and it’s not what I want for Niko.”"

        "text": "nothing but steel and jade and blood. It’s not a safe or happy life… and it’s not what I want for Niko.”\nThe flare in the Pillar’s aura made Tar look up with more interest. In a soft, disbelieving voice,\nHilo said, “Niko is my nephew, the son of a Pillar of No Peak, the great-grandson of the Torch of\nKekon. He was born to be a Green Bone. And you want him to grow up speaking another language,\nsurrounded by foreigners, never wearing jade, never knowing who he is?” Eyni truly was a faithless\nwoman, but Hilo felt that what she was doing now was even worse than her betrayal of Lan. “How\ncan you justify that, as a Kekonese?”\nEyni stood, hands clenched at her sides. “You don’t understand anything, Hilo. Maybe if Lan\nwere still alive, things would be different, but you’re not Lan. You’re not Niko’s father. And I’m not\nan underling of the clan who’ll upend my family’s life to do whatever you want.”\n“Watch how you talk to the Pillar, now,” Tar broke in with a warning note in his voice, but Hilo\nsilenced him with a look and a sharp shake of the head. He’d heard a car door closing outside and\nnow he Perceived someone approaching the house.\nEyni rushed to the door as it opened. A trim Stepenish man with reddish hair stepped inside.\nSeeing Hilo and Tar, he stopped in surprise and confusion. Hilo rose from his seat and Tar stood with\nhim. Eyni took her boyfriend’s arm and said in Kekonese, so everyone could understand, “Lors, this\nis Hilo, my ex-husband’s brother from Janloon. He and his friend were visiting Lybon and dropped in\nto say hello. I forgot to mention they were coming.”\nThe man’s posture relaxed slightly. Hilo realized that Eyni was afraid for Lors’s safety. She was\ntrying to put him at ease, to prevent him from trying to challenge the strange men in his house.\n“Hello,” Lors said warily, in accented but reasonably fluent Kekonese. “We haven’t had any of Eyni’s\nfriends from Kekon visit us before. How long are you here?”\n“Not long,” Hilo said. “I came to meet my nephew. Until a few months ago, I didn’t know I had\none. It’s unfortunate you live so far away; the rest of my family would like to meet him too.”\n“Yes, well, it’s a rather awkward situation, it is,” said the man, smiling nervously and running a\nhand through his coppery hair. “We figured there might be some hard feelings, after all.”\n“None that can’t be put aside,” Hilo replied. He glanced at Eyni, who stood stiffly by her\nboyfriend’s side. “I was just talking to Eyni about how much we wish you’d all return to Janloon. But\nshe seems to prefer it here. You must’ve done a good sales job, to be able to lure a Kekonese woman\nso far from home.”\nLors chuckled, put at ease by Hilo’s casual and complimentary tone. “I must say, before I lived"

        "text": "so far from home.”\nLors chuckled, put at ease by Hilo’s casual and complimentary tone. “I must say, before I lived\nin Kekon, I’d no idea how beautiful the women were there. I don’t know how I was so lucky as to get\none.” He gave Eyni’s bottom an affectionate pat. “I’ve traveled to my fair share of exotic places, and I\ndare say she’s the best souvenir I’ve brought back from any of them. Isn’t that right, flower?” Eyni\nsmiled in a faintly uncomfortable way, still looking at Hilo. Lors said, “Listen, Hilo—I did say your\nname right, didn’t I? You seem like a good fellow. I just want to say that I never meant anything\nagainst your brother. I didn’t even know him. It’s just that Eyni and I, well…” He put his arm around\nEyni, who stiffened a little more, “We were—are—in love. Do you have a woman at home that you\nlove?”\nHilo gave a nod.\n“Well, then, you can understand, can’t you? In my country, we have a saying.” Lors spoke a\nphrase in Stepenish, then translated it into Kekonese. “‘Flowers grow even in the desert; so too there\nis nowhere love cannot happen.’”\nHilo’s lips twitched upward. “It’s nice to see that the two of you are happy together, even after\nsuch a big move and the addition of a child that you must’ve hoped was yours.”\nThe man’s smile wavered. “Well… families can be messy, can’t they? We plan to give Nikolas\nplenty of brothers and sisters. He’ll fit right in and it’ll all work out.”\n“I’m sure it will,” Hilo said. “But it’s a shame for my nephew to be so far from his relatives and\nnot know anything of his Kekonese heritage. So we should compromise. In a few years, when Niko’s\nolder, he can split his time between Stepenland and Kekon. Half the year here in Lybon, half the year\nin Janloon.” Hilo was honestly pleased with the solution that had just occurred to him, and felt that it\ncould not possibly be objectionable. It was not a perfect arrangement, not what he’d hoped for, but\nhe’d come here knowing that Eyni was difficult. This would be acceptable to everyone. “When he’s in\nJanloon, he’ll live with me and my wife and we’ll treat him like our own son. There are international\nschools in Janloon now, even ones that teach Stepenish and other languages. He can attend one of\nthose until he’s ten; then he can go to Kaul Dushuron Academy during the school year and return to\nLybon during the holidays. He’ll grow up to appreciate both countries and both cultures. A global\ncitizen. Everyone says that’s the way of the future; it’ll be an advantage for him.”\n“That sounds like an excellent idea,” said Lors. “Don’t you think so, flower? Especially after we\nhave kids of our own, it’ll be awfully helpful for Nikolas’s Kekonese relatives to raise him some of\nthe time.” To Hilo, “You might take your offer back if you knew how much of a colicky little monster"

        "text": "the time.” To Hilo, “You might take your offer back if you knew how much of a colicky little monster\nhe can be! I think it was rather hard on Eyni the first six months.”\nEyni’s face was rigid; she nudged her boyfriend in the ribs in an attempt to make him stop\ntalking. Hilo said, “Tar and I will be in Lybon for a few more days. We’ve never been here before and\nwant to look around and enjoy the city. Why don’t we all get together for a proper dinner on Fifthday\nevening—I’ll pay, of course—and talk about this some more, so I can tell the family the good news.\nBring Niko along; we’ll go somewhere casual.”\nThe red-haired man shook Hilo’s hand and then Tar’s. “I dare say I’m sorry we’ve never met\nbefore now. Eyni, you really should’ve told me they were coming.” In an aside to Hilo, “I don’t\nunderstand why she doesn’t keep in touch with relatives in Kekon. Seems to think they’ll judge us.\nPersonally, during my two years in Janloon, I found all the people I met to be good-natured and\npleasant. Nothing like the stereotypes.”\n“I only want what’s best for both our families,” Hilo said.\nThey made arrangements to reconvene in three days’ time. Hilo and Tar left the house and\nwalked back to the rental car. “What’re we going to do here for three days?” Tar asked.\nHilo glanced back at the house and lit a cigarette. “I want you to follow that man and find out\neverything there is to know about him. It could be useful.”\nCHAPTER\n20\nComplications\nY\nou’ve been quiet,” Maro said. They lay facing each other, Shae’s leg thrown over his thigh, his\nhand resting on her hip, their bodies sticky and languid. The pedestal fan in the corner of Maro’s\nbedroom oscillated back and forth, blowing cooled air over their bare skin. The Autumn Festival had\nrecently passed, and typhoon season this year had been mild, but still the blanket of summer lingered\ndamp and heavy over Janloon. Shae did not want to get up to go to work.\n“Something on your mind?” Maro asked.\nA lot of things were on her mind—too many to choose from, all of them No Peak matters that\nwould be difficult to explain. She ran a hand over the curve of Maro’s bare shoulder. “Does it bother\nyou?” she asked. “That I wear more jade? That I’m a Kaul?” She wondered if she sounded insecure,\nbut with Maro she felt unguarded, removed from the day-to-day realities of the clan.\nMaro hesitated. He drew his fingers up her arm and collarbone to the hollow of her throat,\nbringing them to rest lightly on the two-tier jade choker around her neck. “It does bother me a little,”\nhe admitted. “Men are expected to be stronger and greener than women, and it’s hard not to be\naffected by what the world expects. People might assume I’m trying to climb to the top of the clan by\nbeing with you, when that’s not true. I like spending time with you for your personality, not your\nfamily name or your jade.”"

        "text": "being with you, when that’s not true. I like spending time with you for your personality, not your\nfamily name or your jade.”\nShae lowered her head and flicked her tongue over his nipple. “Just my personality?”\n“And this.” He jiggled one of her breasts. “And this.” He squeezed her ass, and Shae gave a yelp\nof laughter. Maro’s smile faded. “I should be the one asking you. Are you ashamed of dating me? Is\nthat why we always come to my place, because you don’t want to introduce me to your family?”\nShae was quiet for a moment. “You might not want to know my family.”\n“I’m not naive,” Maro said. “I know Green Bones, and I know your brother’s reputation.”\n“It’s not just Hilo. The realities of the clan, of being a Kaul… you might not want to be a part of\nthat.” She traced his eyebrow with her thumb. For the past three months, whenever she made her\nusual weekly visit to the Temple of Divine Return and knelt to pray in the sanctum, she thought of\nDoru’s body flung back against the armchair. “I had to kill a man recently. Someone I knew well.”\nMaro stiffened slightly. “I’m sure there were good reasons.”\n“There were, but I couldn’t do it,” Shae said. “I’ve never had to kill someone I knew so\npersonally. When the time came, I couldn’t draw my blade. Strangely enough, I’m sad that I failed\nhim. And worse yet, I lost the respect of a person whose support I need.” She was still mulling on\nhow she’d damaged her standing with Hami. The Master Luckbringer was a former Fist; he was\nunlikely to forgive such a stumble. A Green Bone leader couldn’t be soft or hesitant, especially if she\nwas a woman and people were expecting her to fail. Ayt Mada had killed her father’s closest friends;\nshe had ordered the death of her own brother. She would not have hesitated in that cabin.\nShae said to Maro, “You wear jade, but you’re an educated, accomplished professional and a\nworld traveler. I wish there were more people like you. You’re the modern side of the country. But\nKekon’s other side is all blood and steel. Somehow, as the Weather Man of No Peak, I have to be both\nof those things at the same time.”\nMaro was silent for a long minute. Then he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed,\nhis back to her, elbows resting on his knees. Shae wondered if she had said something wrong,\ninadvertently offended him in some way, but before she could ask, Maro said, “There’s a reason why\nI chose a career in foreign studies, and why I’ve specialized in Shotar in particular.” He looked over\nhis shoulder at Shae, then turned back around partway to face her. “My father was a Shotarian soldier\nstationed in the Janloon garrison during the Many Nations War. He fell in love with a local girl; he\nand my mother wanted to get married but neither side would allow it. He was sent back to Shotar\nalong with the rest of the retreating army, and my mother gave birth to me a few months later.”"

        "text": "and my mother wanted to get married but neither side would allow it. He was sent back to Shotar\nalong with the rest of the retreating army, and my mother gave birth to me a few months later.”\nMaro’s voice took on a bitter edge that Shae had never heard in him before. “My grandparents\ntold everyone that my father was a young Green Bone fighter in the One Mountain Society who’d\nbeen killed in the war. Far better to be the love child of a dead jade warrior than the bastard of an\nenemy soldier. To preserve the family’s reputation, my mother went along with the story her whole\nlife. She finally told me the truth while sick on her deathbed, when I was in my twenties. All my life\nuntil then, I’d wondered why, if my father was supposedly a Green Bone warrior, I was so hopeless at\nthe jade disciplines. I figured it was my fault for not trying hard enough, for reading books instead of\ntraining.” Maro raised his face toward the ceiling and laughed painfully. “To think of all the\nchildhood insecurity I could’ve avoided. When I learned the truth, I was furious at my mother and\ngrandparents. They robbed me of half my identity, just because they were ashamed.”\nMaro shifted closer. He tucked a strand of hair behind Shae’s ear, giving her a wan smile. “I\nknow that I can’t understand what it’s like to be a Kaul, or the pressures you face as Weather Man.\nBut you don’t have a monopoly on poisonous honor culture. Maybe the Green Bone clans sit at the\ntop of it, but it goes all the way down.”\nShae was not sure what to say. She felt grateful to Maro for confiding in her, but also oddly\nculpable. She and her family were very much responsible for perpetuating the Green Bone way of\nlife, the cultural preoccupation with greenness that permeated every aspect of Kekonese society. “Did\nyou ever try to find your father afterward?” she asked.\n“I did.” Maro leaned against the headboard. “It took me a few years to even work up the courage\nto look for him, but I eventually found him. After the war, he married a woman in his home country. I\nfound out that I have two Shotarian half sisters.” Maro paused, his gaze turned inward. “I went to\nLeyolo City six years ago for the first time to meet all of them. It was… a strange experience. I think\nmy father never stopped feeling sad and guilty about leaving my mother, even though he had no\nchoice because deserting the Shotarian army meant execution. I get the sense that my existence\nreminds him of sad times. He’s nice enough, and we still keep in touch, but…” Maro trailed off. The\nsun was creeping up the window. Outside, Shae could hear the chime of the street tram and the shouts\nof the city’s more industrious street hawkers. Maro said, with a happier note in his voice, “I’ve gotten\nto know my half sisters much better. They’re younger than me, of course, and the older of them—\nthose are her two girls, my nieces, in the picture.”\nShae had always thought that the two children did not look Kekonese, but had politely refrained\nfrom questioning Maro about it. “They’re awfully cute,” she told him."

I hope one day if I have children that they’re half\nas good as my nieces.”\nShae looked at the two cherubic faces and then back over at Maro. How many Kekonese would\nnot only admit to, but seek out, a foreign bloodline? Her own adopted cousin, Anden, had never\nshown any interest in his biological father or his Espenian ancestry. It still pained her to remember\nhow unhappy he’d been about being sent to Port Massy at all. Perhaps things were different for Maro\nbecause he could easily pass as completely Kekonese, but then again, in their parents’ and\ngrandparents’ generation, Shotarians were the most despised of foreigners. “It was brave of you to\ncontact the Shotarian side of your family. And to make the effort to have a real relationship with\nthem.” She meant it sincerely.\nMaro put the photograph back down. “The rest of my family doesn’t think so. My grandmother’s\npassed away now—let the gods recognize her—but my grandfather won’t talk about it, and neither\nwill my uncles or cousins. They think it was wrong for me to stir up something that should’ve been\nleft alone.” Maro sighed. He picked out his clothes from the closet and began to dress, slowly. “They\nhave reasons other than prejudice. I’m the only one in my family who wears jade. I have a good\ncareer at the university and connections to the Royal Council. The story of my real parentage would\nonly drag our family down. So I keep it a secret, just like my mother did.”\nMaro sat back down on the bed next to her. “You see? Every family has some darkness that it’s\nafraid to share, even the ones that aren’t famous and powerful.” At her thoughtful silence, Maro\nkissed the curve of her jaw, then looked at the clock on the dresser. “It’s getting late; I should get to\nwork.”\n“Me too.” Shae startled at the time. She got up and went to the closet, taking out the set of\nclothes she kept at Maro’s apartment. She dressed while Maro went into the bathroom to shave and\nwas done when he got out. “I didn’t answer your question,” she said, picking up her shoes. “I do want\nto have you over at my new house, now that it’s finally finished. My sister-in-law is still working on\ndecorating the inside, but I’m mostly moved in by now. Would you like to come over and have dinner\nsometime?”\nMaro patted down his tousled hair; Shae found his rumpled professor appearance in the\nmornings endearingly sexy. “Even now that you know I’m a half-Shotarian bastard?” Maro said it"

A suggestion that perhaps he wasn’t sure he\nshould’ve told her so much, made himself so vulnerable.\nShae went to the door. “My cousin’s mixed blood; it doesn’t matter.” Years ago, she’d made a\nmistake by keeping the relationship with Jerald a secret, fearing her grandfather’s scathing\ndisapproval. But Grandda was gone now, and she was not afraid of Hilo’s opinion, whatever it might\nbe.\nWoon was waiting in Shae’s office when she arrived, thirty minutes later than usual. He stood up as\nshe came in, and Shae felt suddenly awkward, knowing that he suspected the reason she was late this\nmorning and wondering if he could smell Maro all over her. He seemed unusually anxious, not his\nusual self. Swallowing uncomfortably, he handed her a folded piece of paper. Shae began to read it,\nthen looked up at the Weather Man’s Shadow in bewilderment. “What is this?”\n“My resignation, Kaul-jen,” Woon said.\n“Your resignation?” Shae stared at him. “Why?”\nThe man would not meet her eyes. “You can find someone better for the position.”\nShae dropped the letter and her purse on her desk. “What’s this really about, Papi-jen?”\nWoon’s normally even aura was churning with agitation. “I think you know by now,” he said\nhoarsely. “Don’t make me say it, Shae-jen. I value our friendship too much.”\nShae shook her head, fighting down a swell of panic. Her position was tenuous enough as it was.\nShe’d been concerned about losing Hami’s support but had not imagined that she might lose Woon.\nHe had been unfailing in his duties, always dependable, at her side through every difficult situation\nsince she’d come into this office. Woon was her right hand, as he had been for her brother Lan. She\ncould not lose him, not if she wished to remain Weather Man of No Peak. “I don’t accept this\nresignation, Woon-jen.”\nWoon looked up sharply. Shae could count on one hand the number of times she’d seen him\nappear angry. “I’ve served you as best I could,” he said, his voice not quite steady. “You’re being\nunfair, to keep me in a role I’m asking to leave.”\n“I need you,” Shae said. “There’s no one else who could take your place as Shadow, who I’d\ntrust as much. Under other circumstances, you would’ve been Lan’s Weather Man.”\n“I failed Lan-jen,” Woon said, his face stricken. “I’m afraid I’m failing him again now. And that\nI’ll fail you.”\n“The only way you’ll fail me is if you leave.” Shae stood in front of the man. “Please, Papi-jen.\nYou know I could go to the Pillar and ask that he order you to stay. I don’t want to do that. I won’t do\nthat. But I need you to keep helping me as you have.”"

But I need you to keep helping me as you have.”\nWoon’s shoulders sagged. “It’s too painful for me, Shae-jen,” he confessed. “You’re Lan-jen’s\nsister, and the Weather Man, so I would never cross either of those lines; but we spend so much time\ntogether, I can’t help how I feel.”\nShae could not believe this was happening. It was not that she didn’t feel any affection for\nWoon; on the contrary, she’d come to count him as a true friend. He was almost a decade older than\nher, but handsome in an unassuming way, and there was no questioning his work ethic and character.\nShe had simply never considered a romantic relationship with a subordinate. And of course she was\nwith Maro now, so it was out of the question. The fact remained, however, that she could not afford to\nlose Woon Papidonwa, even if she had to hurt him.\n“You’re a good man, Papi-jen,” Shae said. “You deserve someone who’ll show as much devotion\nto you as you’ve shown to the clan and to my family.” She wanted to put a hand on her friend’s arm,\nin the casual manner that she used to, but was afraid to touch him in any way now, for fear of making\nthe situation worse. Her mind sprinted through options: Could she offer him more pay? A bigger\noffice? Or would that only offend him, show her to be even more callous than he already thought she\nwas? She had only one reliable piece of emotional leverage over him, and she used it now, knowing\nand regretting that it would have a cruel effect on him.\n“We’re both in our positions because of tragedy, because we owe it to Lan to be able to face him\nin the afterlife,” she insisted. “We managed to keep No Peak afloat during the war, but there’s a lot\nmore to do, to make the business strong enough to outlast its enemies. We’re a good team, Papi-jen;\nwe’re changing the Weather Man’s office for the better. We’ve made investments and alliances that\nwill pay off. And the work we’re doing won’t just benefit the clan, but the country as a whole. Give it\na year. Can you put aside any discomfort you might have around me, for one year?”\nShae stopped talking, afraid that if she continued, she’d only show her own desperation and\nweaken what she’d already said. She waited with held breath as indecision shifted across Woon’s\nface. At last, eyes downcast, he nodded reluctantly. Shae breathed again. The Weather Man’s Shadow\nopened his mouth to say something, but at that moment, there was a loud knock on Shae’s office door.\nWoon stepped away from her as the door opened and Hami thrust his head into the room. He\nglanced between them for a second, eyes narrowed, then said, brusquely, “It’s happened. Espenian\nground forces invaded Oortoko. It’s on every news channel right now.”\nThey followed him into the office floor’s common area, where a dozen people were gathered\naround a television.

        "text": "They followed him into the office floor’s common area, where a dozen people were gathered\naround a television. On screen, the KNB news anchor Toh Kita was speaking to a political analyst\nover video footage showing convoys of Espenian military transports traveling through the hills of\neastern Shotar and air support launching from the aircraft carrier RES Massy.\nThe news cut to Chancellor Son Tomarho giving a speech in Wisdom Hall. The chancellor\ndeclared that “Kekon stands with its Espenian allies” but also emphasized the need for “diplomacy,\nhonest dialogue, and mutual respect,” and he expressed deep concern about the potential for civilian\ncasualties in the military conflict. Shae understood all that to mean the Espenians had not informed\nthe Kekonese government before proceeding to invade Oortoko. In his official comments on behalf of\nthe Royal Council, Son was now being forced to walk a fine line between the public interests that the\nCouncil ostensibly represented, the clans they were functionally beholden to, and the reality of the\ncountry’s diplomatic alliances.\nAn hour after Son’s speech, Ayt Madashi held an impromptu interview with reporters as she\nstood outside Wie Lon Temple where she was attending an alumni fundraiser. A crowd of hard-bodied\nyoung Green Bone trainees filled the background of the screen. “In my father’s day, the One\nMountain Society fought against the tyranny and brutality of the Shotarians. It’s appalling that our\njade and our security are now being sacrificed on behalf of the foreigners that killed, raped, and\ntortured our countrymen.” The Pillar of the largest clan on Kekon was as self-assured on camera as\nshe was in person. She spoke in the clear, precise voice of a natural orator and her steady gaze\nappeared to travel through the small television screen to rest on each viewer individually.\n“Chancellor Son can stand with the Espenians,” Ayt said, “but the Mountain clan stands for\nKekon alone. We will defend it against avowed enemies or those masquerading as friends. I am not a\npolitician. Gold and jade, never together. But if you must choose between the two, count on jade.”\nA few people standing near the office television began to cheer, before realizing who they were\ncheering. Shae saw them clap their hands over their mouths and glance at her in chagrin. She could\nnot fault them. Ayt Mada, her sworn enemy, who had vowed in Shae’s presence to kill everyone in the\nKaul family and destroy the No Peak clan, had spoken on behalf of the nation’s Green Bones and\ngiven voice to the sentiments of the people of Kekon.\nMeanwhile, Kaul Hilo was nowhere to be seen or found because he was on the other side of the\nworld. “Find the number of the hotel my brother is staying in,” Shae ordered her secretary as she\nstrode back to her office. “Then get me on the phone with him, now.”\nCHAPTER\n21\nChange of Plans\nH\nilo got off the long-distance call and said, “We need to go home.”\nTar, who was watching a ruckets game on the hotel television despite the fact that neither of\nthem understood the rules of the sport, said, “Our flights are booked for Sixthday and we’re supposed\nto have dinner with the kid’s mom and her boyfriend tomorrow night. What do you want to do?”"

        "text": "them understood the rules of the sport, said, “Our flights are booked for Sixthday and we’re supposed\nto have dinner with the kid’s mom and her boyfriend tomorrow night. What do you want to do?”\nHilo picked up the remote control and changed the channel. The news was covering the\nEspenian entry into Oortoko. He couldn’t understand what the Stepenish commentators were saying,\nbut they were referring to a large map of the East Amaric region, with Shotar, the Uwiwa Islands, and\nKekon highlighted. Hilo mumbled a curse under his breath. Trust the Espenians to do things when\nthey pleased, without informing or consulting anyone else.\nShae had made it clear that he needed to return to Janloon as soon as possible, but he was also\ndetermined not to leave Lybon until he’d hammered out an acceptable arrangement regarding his\nnephew’s future. He hated the prospect of explaining to Wen that he’d flown all the way to\nStepenland at her urging, leaving her in her thirty-fourth week of pregnancy, and had nothing to show\nfor it.\nAlso, he found himself thinking about Lan’s son a great deal, and feeling, on a deep and painful\nlevel, a kinship with the child that went even beyond blood relation. Like Niko, Hilo had lost his\nfather when he was not even a year old. From all the stories he’d heard of Kaul Dushuron, Hilo had\nalways imagined he would’ve gotten along with his father—certainly better than he’d gotten along\nwith his grandfather. Niko would never know his father either. Perhaps it was because he was soon to\nbecome a parent himself that the thought caused Hilo to grieve for his elder brother in a way that he\nhad not been able to two years ago, when war and vengeance and survival had been paramount in his\nmind. Over the past couple of days, he’d been unusually morose, unable to enjoy the picturesque\nnovelty of Lybon.\nTar, sensing the Pillar’s mood if not the underlying reasons for it, tried with the earnestness of a\nworried child to lift his spirits, making fun of everything unexpected they encountered—from salty\ncandy, to Stepenish hairdos, to the fact that supermarkets closed at dusk. While Hilo spent time\ndealing with clan issues on phone calls with Shae or Kehn, Tar went around the town and returned to\noffer up daily accomplishments he hoped would please his boss: He’d found a good restaurant and\nmade a reservation for Fifthday; through the clan’s vast network, he’d made a few local connections\nthat might be useful; he’d discreetly tailed Eyni’s boyfriend to an office building near the center of\ntown and discovered where he worked and with whom.\n“You want me to call the airline and see if we can get on an earlier flight?” Tar asked now.\nHilo pinched the bridge of his nose, then nodded. Lybon was seven hours ahead of Janloon; it\nwas early evening and the streetlights outside of their hotel room had just come on. If they took a\nflight out tomorrow morning, they could be back home by the end of the day. “Change the flights,” he\nsaid. “Then we’ll go talk to those two. We’ll insist on having dinner tonight to figure everything out.”\nWhen they got to the house, Hilo said, “Stay in the car this time. You’re too intimidating.” Tar"

Eyni’s never thought\nof me as anything but a goon, and having you standing around like a silent henchman won’t help\nthings. I have to sweet talk those two into seeing reason.” He got out of the car and leaned back\nthrough the open window. “Wait here. I’ll be back out soon and we’ll go eat.”\nHilo paused when he got to the front door. He could Perceive Eyni moving about inside with\nconsiderable energy and haste, and in the back of the house, a small, quiet presence that could only be\nthe slumbering child. The Stepenish man was not home; he must be working late. Suspicion formed\nin Hilo’s mind. In the few days he’d been in Lybon, he’d noticed that it seemed to be common for\npeople to leave gates and doors open. Instead of ringing the bell, he turned the door knob. It was\nunlocked; he pushed open the door and stepped inside.\nThe first thing he saw was two suitcases and a folded stroller sitting in the living room. One of\nthe suitcases was latched shut and upright; the other was open on the floor and partially packed with\ntoddler’s clothing, a stuffed monkey, and a few children’s board books. Eyni’s open purse lay next to\nthe suitcase, wallet and passport visible. Cold understanding filled Hilo. Eyni came out of the\nbedroom, arms full with baby blankets, towels, and a pack of diapers. She froze when she saw Hilo\nstanding in the foyer.\n“Sister Eyni,” Hilo said softly. “It seems you’re about to take a trip.”\nEyni blurted, “We’re not meeting until tomorrow.”\nHilo looked at the suitcases and the pile of supplies in her arms. “You’re overpacking if you plan\nto be back in time for dinner tomorrow night. Where’s that foreign boyfriend of yours?”\nThe blankets trembled in Eyni’s arms. “He went out for a minute.”\n“He’s tying things up at work because you don’t expect to be back for a while,” Hilo inferred.\nHis voice turned hard. “Where were you planning to go? You were going to disappear without telling\nme; you figured you’d leave me waiting around like a fool.”\n“Go home, Hilo.” Eyni’s voice rose, pleading and angry. “I didn’t reply to your letters for a\nreason, and you still showed up at my house uninvited. Lors doesn’t know what you and the clan are\nlike. You would’ve convinced him to let you have what you wanted—to take my son back to Kekon\nand raise him as a killer. That’s right, a jade-obsessed killer destined to die young, just like his father\nand his grandfather. And like you.”\n“That’s how you talk about your husband and my brother? And my father, who gave his life for\nhis country?” Hilo’s lips drew back. “What happened to you, Eyni?”\nEyni set the items down and straightened to her full height. She’d always been a proud and"

        "text": "his country?” Hilo’s lips drew back. “What happened to you, Eyni?”\nEyni set the items down and straightened to her full height. She’d always been a proud and\nelegant woman, a former dancer, and now, in an effort to reclaim some of the status she’d once held\nover Hilo when he’d been a young Fist and she the wife of the Pillar, she lifted her chin and glared at\nhim. “You haven’t changed at all, Hilo. You always were a vicious thug at heart, an arrogant boy\nobsessed with jade and his own ego. You don’t care about Niko; you only want to turn him into one of\nyour followers.” She breathed in hard. “Do you know that in Espenia, civilian possession of jade is\nnow banned? That other countries including Stepenland are likely to follow suit? People associate\njade with soldiers and mercenaries and gangsters, and that’s how you want to raise my son? No, Hilo.\nNothing you can offer will sway me. I want Nikolas to grow up Stepenish, with Stepenish friends and\nsiblings and a Stepenish education. I don’t want him to have anything to do with you.”\nFor one of the few times in his life, Hilo was speechless. For some seconds, he felt nothing\nexcept an initial shock, as disorienting as being stabbed in the stomach. Then hurt flooded in, and\nwith it, rage.\n“Go home to your Fists and turf wars,” Eyni said. “I won’t ever let Niko become a Green Bone.”\nShe stepped backward into the kitchen and picked up the receiver of the phone, hovering her finger\nover the dial. He saw her eyes flicker to the block of kitchen knives that lay within her easy reach.\n“Go or I’ll call the police. They’ll be here in minutes. You’re a foreign tourist with no power or\nauthority in this country, and if I tell them you broke into my house, they’ll put you in jail.”\n“Let me see Niko,” Hilo said. Eyni’s finger moved, dialing a single number. “I’ll go,” Hilo\npromised in a low voice that bordered on a plea, “but at least let me see my nephew.”\nFor a second, the defeat in Hilo’s voice and the open hurt in his expression seemed to have an\neffect on Eyni. She depressed the phone cradle. Then, as if remembering her determination not to give\nher former brother-in-law even a sliver of leverage, she set her lips together in a line and shook her\nhead.\nFrom the nursery, Nikolas began to cry. “Maaaa…”\nEyni turned toward the sound and took two steps, and Hilo moved, with the sort of speed that\nonly a heavily jaded Green Bone can call upon. He wrapped one arm around the front of her body,\nholding her in place. Pressing his palm to her back, he Channeled with all his might in one sharp,\nviolent thrust. Eyni’s head snapped back; the top of her skull smacked Hilo in the chin. His jade\nenergy tore through her with the destructive precision of a metal shaft and she died without uttering a\nsound.\nHilo’s vision wavered.

        "text": "sound.\nHilo’s vision wavered. He sank to his knees on the kitchen floor, still holding Eyni as if in a\nlover’s embrace. The energy blowback of her death crashed over him and then washed out, leaving\nhim momentarily dazed and rattled. He’d cut the inside of his lip on his teeth where her head had\nsmacked into his mouth, and the sharp tang of blood on his tongue along with the droning sound of\nthe telephone dial tone near his ear brought him back to himself. He reached up and set the telephone\nreceiver back into its cradle. Standing up, he lifted Eyni and carried her to the sofa. He laid her down\nlengthwise on the cushions, then stood back, wiping sweat from his brow with the cuff of his sleeve.\nShe didn’t look pained or awkward in death, just soft and limp, and he arranged her arms across\nher stomach so she looked even more natural. Hilo walked back into the kitchen and took a long drink\nof water directly from the kitchen faucet. Then he stood with his hands leaning against the counter\nand stared for a long minute at the body of the woman on the sofa. She hadn’t suffered or struggled at\nall, had not even seen death coming, which only showed that she was still an ignorant and haughty\nperson at heart, to not understand her own position clearly and anticipate what Green Bones were\ncapable of—what he was capable of—when grievously pushed and insulted. He’d gone to every\nlength to meet her more than halfway, offered every reasonable allowance, kept his temper so firmly\nin check—all to no avail.\nHilo had never liked Eyni and always thought Lan was wrong to let her and her lover walk away\nwith no consequence in the first place, but looking at her now, he felt sad. He knew Lan would not\nhave wanted her killed, even for the sake of his own son.\n“Maaaa,” came the cry again, from the room down the hall. Hilo followed the sound; he stepped\nover the child gate blocking the way and went into the nursery where he found Niko standing up,\nholding on to the slats of the crib. He was calling out in an impatient but not tearful way, and when\nHilo came into the room, he stopped making noise and stared up at his uncle with wide eyes and an\nopen mouth. Hilo lifted the child out of the crib and set him on the ground. The boy sat down, picked\nup a toy car and began pushing it along the carpet. Hilo crouched down next to him. “Car,” Niko said\nin Kekonese, then sang a nursery song in Stepenish and looked to Hilo for approval. Hilo smiled and\nheld out his hand. “Come with me, Nikoyan.” The name came to him at once, a perfect Kekonese\nname. He led the boy out of the nursery and into the living room, opening and closing the child gate\nfor him to pass through. Niko went to Eyni. “Ma ma ma,” he said.\n“Your ma is sleeping,” Hilo said gently. He placed the supplies Eyni had been carrying into the\nsmaller suitcase along with the child’s other packed belongings, then shut and latched it.

He searched\ninside the open purse and found Niko’s birth certificate tucked inside Eyni’s passport; when he\nunfolded it, he saw that the field for the father’s name had been left blank. He refolded the certificate\nand tucked it into his jacket pocket. He knelt down and pointed to the toy car in Niko’s hand. “Would\nyou like to go for a car ride?”\nThe boy’s expression brightened. He stopped trying to rouse his mother and held out his arms to\nbe picked up. Hilo kissed the child on the top of the head, then scooped him up in one arm and picked\nup the suitcase with the other. He carried Niko out of the house and to the car where Tar was still\nwaiting. Hilo threw the suitcase into the rear seat, then got in the front passenger side, holding the\ntwo-year-old in his lap. “Niko-se,” he said, “this is your uncle Tar.”\n“It’s nice to meet you, Niko,” Tar said, ruffling the toddler’s hair. “You’re a good-looking boy.”\nIf the Pillarman was surprised to see Hilo emerge alone from the house with the child, it showed only\nas a shift of alertness in his jade aura, a beat of hesitation as he looked at the Pillar questioningly.\nHilo said, “We need to call the airline to transfer your plane ticket to Niko. And I need to find a\ntypewriter to fill in his birth certificate, so he can board the plane with me. You’ll have to stay behind\nto deal with the boyfriend. Be quick and careful about it. He’s not so bad; he shouldn’t suffer at all.”\nTar nodded, then handed the car keys to Hilo. “You’d better put the kid in the back seat and take\nthe car back to the hotel. I’ll wait here. See you in a few days.”\nSix weeks later, Wen gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Hilo brought his nephew into the room where\nWen was resting. Kaul Rulinshin, three hours old, lay on his mother’s breast. Bouquets of\nchrysanthemums and yellow heaven’s breath flowers—symbolizing joy and good health—had been\nsent by the clan faithful and crowded every available surface in the room.\n“Baby,” Niko exclaimed. “Little baby.” He had begun to string Kekonese words together into\nshort sentences. After several frustrated tantrums, he no longer tried to speak Stepenish.\nHilo swung the toddler up in his arms and set him on the edge of the bed. After sixteen hours of\nlabor, Wen’s eyes were ringed with exhaustion but shone bright with triumph. Hilo leaned over and\nplaced a kiss on Wen’s brow, then on the baby’s head, breathing in his son’s indescribable sweetness.\nNiko reached out to pat the infant’s wispy hair. “That’s your little cousin,” Hilo told him. “The two of\nyou have to take care of each other from now on.”\nFIRST INTERLUDE\nLost and Found\nA\nwell-known figure in the ancient history of the Tun Empire is a man named Ganlu, who was a\nwarrior, healer, religious philosopher, and advisor to Emperor Sh’jan the Third.

        "text": "A\nwell-known figure in the ancient history of the Tun Empire is a man named Ganlu, who was a\nwarrior, healer, religious philosopher, and advisor to Emperor Sh’jan the Third. Ganlu is described in\nTuni historical texts as a bearded foreigner who came from the Island in the West. Accounts differ as\nto the date of his arrival, but it is said that when he saw the vast plains of the Great Basin of Tun he\nfell to his knees and praised the gods, famously exclaiming (in a phrase that would later be\nappropriated by various Tuni rulers and generals as justification for imperial expansion): “Glorious\nland, where a man can walk for his whole life and never reach the sea!”\nGanlu traveled for many years. In the wake of recent famine and war, the Tun countryside was\nplagued by lawlessness and banditry, against which common villagers were often helpless. Wherever\nGanlu went, he confronted crime and immorality, taught martial skills to the ordinary people, treated\nsickness and ailments with his healing touch, and espoused a philosophy of peaceful living,\nneighborly obligation, and communion with the divine spirits of the land, rivers, and sky. His\nteachings formed the basis for krajow, the Tuni fighting arts, and greatly influenced the Shubai\nreligion.\nEventually, the traveler’s reputation reached the ears of the emperor, who summoned Ganlu and\nhis disciples to the palace and asked him to become a royal advisor. Ganlu refused three times before\nconsenting, each time asking the emperor to offer evidence of his virtues as a monarch. Ganlu’s\nacumen as a counselor and the founding of his schools of krajow are recounted in further legends,\nwhich differ in detail but hold in common that Ganlu derived extraordinary power and wisdom from\nan enchanted stone given to him by his forest goddess mother and which he wore close to his heart at\nall times. It is said that Ganlu lived until the age of one hundred and seventy; upon his death, his spirit\nwent into the stone, which was kept in the Imperial Palace so that the emperor could continue to\nconsult it.\nWhile historians agree that Ganlu was a Kekonese Green Bone and that his teachings bear\nconsiderable resemblance to both Abukei folklore and pre-Deitist spirituality, only recently have they\nconcluded that he was most likely the third son of the king of Jan during the early part of the Three\nCrowns period in Kekonese history.\nKekon has no record of this man, other than a royal genealogy set down at the time with an\nunnamed reference to “a young prince, lost.”\nCHAPTER\n22\nThe Grudge Hall\nA\nnden played relayball twice a week now, with Dauk Corujon and a group of his friends, in the\ngrass and dirt field behind the neighborhood high school. One day, two weeks after the dinner at the\nDauks’ house, the Pillar’s son had ridden by the Hians’ home while Anden was outside, standing on a\nstepladder and fixing a broken gutter. Instead of speeding past as he usually did, Cory stopped his\nbicycle and called up to Anden. “Hey, islander, you play relayball?”\nAnden wiped his hands on his pants and came down the ladder. “Yeah.”"

The young\nman looked Anden up and down.\n“I played on the team at the Aca—” Suddenly, he didn’t want Cory to know he’d gone to the\nAcademy, that he’d been trained as a Green Bone. “At my school in Janloon.”\n“What position did you play?”\n“First guard.”\nCory nodded. “Fifthday evening, all right? I’ll come get you.” He pushed his bike forward and\npedaled off again before Anden could say yes or no.\nAt the first game, Cory introduced him to a group of similarly aged young men and said, “Look\nhere, crumbs, this is our new first guard, Andy.”\n“Anden,” Anden corrected quickly, and perhaps more forcefully than he’d intended. He smiled\nto soften the unintended rudeness and said in a friendlier voice, “I go by Anden.” He hadn’t meant to\nstrike yet another awkward note with the local Pillar’s son, now that they’d finally had a conversation\nof more than twenty words and he was being brought into Cory’s group of friends. It was just that\nback home, his cousin Hilo was the only one who ever called him Andy; it seemed strange for\nsomeone else to do so.\nAnden discovered that he was one of the better players. Relayball was the primary national sport\nin Kekon, but here in Espenia, only the Kekonese and Shotarian communities played the game, so the\nmost athletic members of Cory’s informal league had other pursuits that they took more seriously—\nbootball, ruckets, swimming—and they came to the Secondday and Fifthday games at the high school\nfield purely for recreation. There was a lot of joking and mock feuding, and Anden found it hard to\nfollow all the Espenian slang that was tossed around, but soon the gatherings became the highlight of\nhis week. He didn’t quite fit in, but that was fine, he was used to that. At least he was becoming an\naccepted member of the community. No matter how busy he was with schoolwork, the Hians always\nencouraged him to go. “It’s good that you’re finally making friends,” they said.\nCory played the position of finisher. He was the best player, and the unofficial organizer and\nleader of the neighborhood league. At first, Anden assumed that could be attributed to the fact that he\nwas a Green Bone and the son of the Pillar, but he soon came to realize that the young man stood on\nhis own feet. Cory never spoke of his father’s dealings, and even after two months of seeing him\ntwice a week, Anden had not figured out where he wore his jade. As far as Anden could tell, Cory\nnever employed his advantages of Strength or Lightness while on the relayball field. Even so, he\nalways placed himself and Shun Todorho, the other Green Bone who regularly showed up at the\ngames, on opposite teams, so all would be fair. He didn’t argue about points either.

He seemed to get along with everyone. Even when he called Anden,\n“you fool islander,” he did so lightheartedly and with a teasing wink that could not be construed as\nmean-spirited.\nAnden had a hard time imagining how Cory would fare as a Finger in Janloon. People would not\nknow what to think of a Green Bone who was so easygoing, who seemed so quick to please.\nThey played throughout autumn, when damp wind billowed the relayball nets and the evenings\ngrew cold enough for them to need hats and gloves. One Fifthday, they were finally driven off the\nfield by the first real winter storm; the ever-present clouds over Port Massy darkened to the color of\nslate and began dumping icy sleet over the city. People ran between cars and buildings with briefcases\nand newspapers held over their heads. The clumpy turf behind the high school turned into a soggy\nmarsh. Anden slipped during a pass and landed hard on his back in a puddle of freezing slush. He’d\nnever experienced such cold before in his life. He decided, as he rose with his teeth chattering, all his\nextremities numb, and his glasses too smeared and fogged to see through, that it was no wonder the\nEspenians were a people who’d sailed all over the world, if their homeland was so inhospitable.\nCory called a premature end to the evening; everyone hurried for their homes. Anden dreaded\ntrying to bike back to the Hians’ house in such weather. “This won’t last long,” Cory said to him and\ntwo of the other remaining players as they huddled under the high school’s covered back\nentranceway. “Let’s run over to the grudge hall to warm up and get something to eat while we wait it\nout.”\nThey hurried two blocks through Southtrap to a rectangular, gray building that from the outside\nlooked not unlike a school or library. The large white sign over the front entrance read KEKONESE\nCOMMUNITY CENTER in both Kekonese and Espenian. Anden had passed it many times and walked\nthrough the doors out of curiosity one Seventhday morning. Inside and to the right he’d discovered a\ntiny Deitist shrine with a framed poster print of the mural of Banishment and Return hanging on the\nwall in front of a couple dozen faded green kneeling cushions and a row of blackened incense\ncandles. To the left was a cafeteria-style kitchen behind an area of clumped tables and armchairs\noccupied by elderly people playing circle chess or reading out-of-date newspapers and well-used\nbooks taken from the unstaffed Kekonese-language library, which consisted of several bookcases\ncrammed against the back wall. Down the hall, there was a small fitness room with exercise\nequipment and a schedule of classes posted on the door. The drop-in hourly daycare was manned by\ntwo teenagers.\n“The community center?” Anden asked skeptically, his lips numb with cold as they ran across\nthe slicked street through a gap in traffic.

He didn’t think the place would be where a group of young\nmen would want to spend Fifthday evening. “That’s what you meant by the grudge hall?”\nOne of Cory’s friends, Ledt Derukun, snickered, but the other, Shun Todorho, said, “That’s just\nthe front of the place, crumb. The grudge hall’s in the basement; you get in from the back.” They\njogged around the rear of the gray building to a set of unmarked metal doors, where to Anden’s\nsurprise an erected portable metal awning sheltered a long line of people—mostly men, but women as\nwell—young and old, rubbing their arms and stamping their feet against the cold as they waited to get\nin. Cory led the way to the front where the door attendant, a muscular man in a fleece-lined raincoat\nsaid, “Cory, it’s been a while.” He nodded to the other two. “Derek, Tod, good to see you.”\n“Hey, big Sano,” Cory said, clasping the doorman’s hand and bumping his shoulder with his\nown. “Miserable night, but maybe that’ll mean a lot of people tonight, yeah? My folks in there?”\n“Sure are.” The man pushed the metal door open and stepped aside to let them enter ahead of all\nthe others waiting. Anden was surprised; it was the first time he’d seen Cory take advantage of his\nstatus as the Pillar’s son. The doorman stopped Anden before he could go in. “Not him,” Sano said in\nKekonese, eyeing Anden with disapproval before saying to Cory, “You know the rules about outsiders\nin the grudge hall. Thirddays only, and it’s twenty thalirs.”\n“He’s one of us,” Cory said. “Straight off the island, even. Plays relayball like a pro.”\n“That true?” asked Sano, speaking to Anden. “You’re Kekonese?”\n“I was born in Janloon,” Anden said. “My family sent me here to study.”\nCory said, “It’s true. You can even ask my da; he’ll vouch for him.”\nSano raised his eyebrows. “How about that,” he said, and let Anden pass.\nInside, the warm smell of food hit Anden at once. They were in a large open room with exposed\nceiling beams and a concrete floor—it appeared to have been originally built as the community\ncenter’s garage. From portable cook stations situated behind long white tables, people were serving\nup spicy noodles in soup, hot fried bread, and Kekonese pastries on trays. There were also cheese-\nstuffed potato cakes and the sour sweets so ubiquitous at Espenian sporting events. A line was already\nforming where a cask of hoji had been rolled in and set on a low platform. “Let’s go downstairs and\nsnag a place to sit, first,” Tod suggested.\nThey crossed the room and went down a flight of stairs.

Anden was having a hard time\nreconciling what he’d seen in the uninspiring front part of the building with the liveliness of the rear\nhalf now. In the basement, small bar tables and stools were crowded along the brick walls; people\nwere claiming spots by draping jackets over their chairs. Tod and Derek found seats for the four of\nthem near the loudly chugging radiator. Anden followed more slowly, distracted. An area roughly the\nsize of an indoor ruckets court was cordoned off with blue rope and bordered with bench seating. In\nthe center of the bare space, a cockfight was occurring. Bettors leaned over the barrier, shouting in\nexcitement or groaning in disappointment as one of the gamecocks fell beneath its opponent’s steel\nspurs in a feathery melee.\nCory led the way to the table where his parents were sitting, eating steaming noodles from\ndisposable plastic bowls and talking to Rohn Toro—the man Anden had begun to think of as the Horn\nof Southtrap—and two others that Anden did not know, but suspected must also be Green Bones.\nCory said, “Well, relayball season’s over; we finally got rained off the field and decided to come here.\nI brought my crumbs.” He smiled and shook hands with the other men around the table, who clapped\nthe Pillar’s son on the back affectionately, asking him whether he was excited about going to law\nschool.\nDauk Losun beamed when he saw Anden standing behind Cory and motioned him over. “My\nyoung friend from Janloon! You’ve never come to the grudge hall before, have you?”\nAnden shook his head. A commotion rose up as the next cockfight got off to a rousing start. The\nPillar raised his voice to be heard. “Now that we know you, you’re welcome anytime. We keep some\nof the old ways from the island, you’ll see. Some of it is serious, but most is in good fun.”\nRohn Toro said, “Everything is sorted out over that little incident, by the way. Just so you know\nnot to worry.”\n“I’m glad to hear that, Rohn-jen,” Anden said, relieved. “I never wanted to cause trouble for\nanyone.”\n“From what I hear, you’re a great help to the Hians, more so than their own sons, who are too\nbusy to visit.” Dauk Sana clucked her disapproval, then patted Anden on the arm. “Have you eaten?\nYou absolutely must try the noodles Mrs. Joek makes.”\nAnden and Cory rejoined Tod and Derek at their own table, then took turns going upstairs to\nfetch food and drinks. Anden’s wet clothes were soon dry; the basement was warm, and as more\npeople arrived and filled the space, it grew somewhat uncomfortably stuffy, yet no one seemed to\nmind. The cockfighting appeared to be the main attraction, but people were also playing cards,\ndrinking, and socializing. Anden overheard several nearby conversations heatedly discussing\nEspenia’s involvement in the Oortokon War. Two young women sidled over to their table, looking sly.\n“Hey, Cory.” One of them pouted. “Why don’t I ever see you anymore?”"

Two young women sidled over to their table, looking sly.\n“Hey, Cory.” One of them pouted. “Why don’t I ever see you anymore?”\n“Aw, Tami, you’re seeing me now, aren’t you?” Cory slapped her ass and pulled her into his lap.\nShe gave a squeal of mock indignation and draped her arms over his shoulders.\nAnden looked away uncomfortably. He slurped another mouthful from his steaming bowl of\nnoodles, which were indeed well worth Dauk Sana’s recommendation, and turned to Tod. “I didn’t\nknow this place existed. Is it always like this?”\n“No, only on certain evenings.” Tod glanced at Cory, deferring the explanation to him, but the\nPillar’s son seemed distracted, so Tod turned back to Anden and said, “When it’s not a grudge hall,\nit’s a training gym.”\nAnden looked around and saw the folded blue gym mats leaning against the wall in one corner,\nthe stacked wooden blocks and closed equipment bins. “A gym for Green Bones,” he said.\nThe chatter in the hall abruptly died away. The girl hopped reluctantly out of Cory’s lap and\nhurried back with her friend to their own table. A few oblivious teens in one corner of the hall\ncontinued chatting, but several nearby adults shushed them so remonstratively that they fell silent.\nAnden turned around on his stool to see that the latest cockfight had ended, and now two men were\nstepping over the blue ropes. They took off their boots, then their shirts, and handed them to friends\nstanding on the other side of the cordon before facing each other.\nIt was easy to hear the scrape of chair legs as Dauk Losun pushed his seat back. There seemed to\nbe nothing to distinguish the Pillar from those around him—his seat in the room was not better than\nanyone else’s; he wore a red sweater vest and wiped his mouth with a paper napkin as he stood up—\nyet no one else spoke a word as Dauk cleared his throat and said, “Orim Rudocun, you’ve been\noffered a clean blade by Yoro Janshogon. Do you accept?”\n“Yes,” said one of the men, who was of slightly heavier build than the other. Neither man\nactually carried a blade. They touched their clasped hands to their foreheads in brief salute but did not\npause to offer up any prayers to the gods.\nThe challenger, Yoro, launched himself at the other man with an angry shout. It was over\nquickly. Yoro drove his shoulder into Orim’s chest. They staggered together into the blue ropes,\nbringing the cordon down with them as Yoro dragged his opponent to the ground by the neck. They\nrolled about in a tangle for a minute. Orim flailed and caught Yoro a blow across the face, but the\nslighter man ended up on top and clamped his hands around his rival’s throat. Snarling, he shook the\nother man—the back of Orim’s head smacked against the concrete floor with a sound that made\neveryone in the hall flinch—then he jammed crossed forearms against Orim’s windpipe, leaned his\nbody weight forward, and began to press with all his might.

Orim sputtered and kicked and clawed at\nYoro’s arms. No one in the hall made a move. A few worried murmurs began to rise.\nSeconds passed; Orim’s face turned purple. Dauk Losunyin stood up again and said, in a stern\nand concerned voice, “Mr. Orim, do you yield? Raise your hands if you do.”\nFor a moment, Anden thought that Orim would refuse and consent to be choked to death. Then,\nreluctantly, he opened his hands in a gesture of submission. Yoro spat in disdain, then released him,\nstood up, and strode away to gather his shirt and boots, staunching his own bleeding mouth with the\nback of his hand. Orim lay on the ground gasping. Two of his friends lifted him to a sitting position\nand, taking him under the arms, helped him out of the hall.\nSomeone righted the rope cordon. The Pillar sat back down. Anden caught a glimpse of Dauk; he\nlooked relieved as he leaned over to say something to Rohn Toro. People turned back to their tables\nand conversation returned to the hall.\n“If you can believe it, Orim and Yoro used to be good friends,” said Derek.\n“Business partnership gone bad,” Cory explained, in response to Anden’s questioning look.\n“Orim says Yoro cheated him out of ten thousand thalirs. Yoro says he did all the work while Orim\nwas doing the deal with Yoro’s girlfriend behind his back.” Cory unwrapped a sour sweet and popped\nit into his mouth. He offered another to Anden, who shook his head—he couldn’t understand why\nanyone liked the taste of those things. “My da was worried about this duel going all the way,” Cory\nsaid, in a lowered voice. “It doesn’t happen often, only once in while over really serious things, but\nit’s a good thing Orim yielded. No one wants the police to come snooping.”\nAnden felt stunned by what he’d seen. Not by the duel itself, despite all the odd differences in\ncustom, but ever since his encounter in the park with the crewboy Carson Sunter, he’d been careful to\ntry and learn all the rules in Espenia. “I thought dueling was illegal,” he said.\n“Crumb, everything in Espenia is illegal.” Derek laughed. “Even cockfighting.”\nCory patted Anden’s arm in a reassuring manner that surprised Anden and made his face warm a\nlittle. “Naw, it’s only that the law is complicated. And more often than not, negotiable.”\n“True words from an aspiring lawyer,” Derek said.\n“Shun Todorho!” came a shout from the center of the room, where a young man now stood in the\nplace where the clean-bladed duel had happened minutes earlier. “Tod, where are you?” He pointed\nthrough the crowd at Anden’s table, then crossed his arms in a posture of mock offense. “I’ve been\nhearing some talk that your Deflection is better than my Lightness. Care to test that bit of bullshit?”\nA round of foot-stomping applause ran through the grudge hall. Cory smacked Tod on the back"

        "text": "hearing some talk that your Deflection is better than my Lightness. Care to test that bit of bullshit?”\nA round of foot-stomping applause ran through the grudge hall. Cory smacked Tod on the back\nencouragingly and shouted back at the other man, “He’s only had two drinks, Sammy, you sure you\ndon’t want to wait?” Shun Todo raised his glass and drained the rest of it dramatically, then slammed\nit down on the table and rose with his hands held up in a show of acquiescence to the crowd’s\ndemands. “Etto Samishun,” Tod growled. “For your arrogance, I offer you… an ass kicking.” More\nfoot stomping and cheers as Tod climbed over the blue rope. In contrast to the sense of deathly\nseriousness of the preceding duel, the mood in the grudge hall was now jovial; everyone could tell\nthat this contest was benign, the typical sort of social challenge that Kekonese threw down all the\ntime.\nThe challenger, Sammy, crouched in a posture of exaggerated readiness. Tod, smirking a little,\nfaced the audience and strode around a little with his arms raised to urge them to make more noise,\nwhich they did with so much enthusiasm that Anden was reminded of an Espenian sporting event and\ncould not help but think the whole display rather crass and un-Kekonese.\nTod whirled and threw a spear of Deflection at Sammy, who leapt Lightly out of the way with a\ntaunting shout. The Deflection buffeted some of the people nearby, who clutched their drinks and\nhung on to their tables and chairs. A plate of food went flying. Tod unleashed two more Deflections in\nquick succession that Sammy was hard-pressed to dodge—he bounded straight over Tod’s head and\nlanded behind him.\nCory whooped and shouted, “Get him, Tod!” Their friend spun and feinted high, then sent out a\nlow, wide Deflection that at last caught the other young man at the knees in midleap and sent him\nsprawling to the ground. Sammy rolled over and held up his hands, grinning and mock cowering\nwhile Tod made a show of pretending to jump on him and finish him off. The people in the hall\ncheered.\nThe two Green Bones clapped each other on the shoulders good-naturedly before climbing back\nover the rope and returning to their tables amid praise. “That was toppers,” Derek said when Tod sat\nback down, and Cory added, “Mass toppers, crumb.”\nAnden nodded along in agreement, though in truth, he hadn’t found the contest to be particularly\nimpressive. The style with which Tod and Sammy employed their jade abilities was different and\nsome of it seemed inefficient. Tod’s Deflection had precision but little power; Sammy’s Lightness was\nnimble enough, but lacked the speed it might have with more Strength. All in all, it had been at the\nlevel of what one might see from year-fives at the Academy.\nThese were ungenerous thoughts, Anden chided himself. The Green Bones here did not receive a\nfull-time education in the jade disciplines.

What little jade they carried, they had to hide at all times.\nThey had to train in secret, in the stuffy basement of a community center instead of the sprawling\ncampus of a school like the Academy. Any pride or status they could claim on account of being green\ncould only be garnered here, within the Kekonese community, on nights like this.\nAll evening, Anden had found the grudge hall strange and a little overwhelming, and now he\nunderstood why: The place was like a distillate of Kekonese culture—the food and hoji, the\ncockfighting and gambling, the social life, the tradition of clean-bladed dueling, and the celebration of\njade abilities—all crammed together under one roof in one evening. It gave Anden the oddest feeling.\nIt was both acutely Kekonese and not Kekonese at all.\nMore food and drink was had, more conversation. Another cockfight was played out. At the\nurging of friends, other Green Bones got up to challenge each other to contests of Strength and Steel.\nAfter a time, Tod, who had to work the next morning (he was an assistant manager at an electronics\nstore) stood up to go, and Anden, already worried that the Hians might be concerned about him being\nout so late, put his drink down and followed suit. Cory said to them, “It’ll be freezing cold and black\nout there by now. Let me see if my da is heading out anytime soon. Maybe he can give us all a ride.”\nAnden did not want to bother Dauk Losun, but Cory had no compunction about going over to\nask his father, who said, “Sure, no problem; no need for me to stay any longer.”\nBefore they could take their leave, however, Mrs. Joek, the noodle lady, rushed down the stairs\ninto the grudge hall and hurried to the Pillar’s table. “Dauk-jens,” she exclaimed, “there are police\nofficers here. Two of them.”\nIn the crowded basement, her words were heard immediately. Conversations died on the spot;\nheads turned anxiously toward the Pillar’s table. To Anden’s surprise, Dauk Sana got up from her\nplace at the table immediately and went upstairs. Her husband did not follow; he raised his voice and\nsaid calmly but loudly enough to be heard, “Everyone, stay where you are and keep enjoying\nyourselves. Don’t worry.” To his son, “You and your friends, go back and sit down.”\nAnden sat back down. The room was thick was unease and shuffling murmurs. Anden saw Rohn\nToro rise from his seat and move to stand in the corner of the room near the door. He removed the\nblack gloves from the breast pocket of his shirt and pulled them on, then leaned against the wall, arms\ncrossed.\nDauk Sana returned a few minutes later, speaking loudly in accented Espenian as she descended.\n“Of course, yes, food license, liquor license—I can show you, officers.” She reached the bottom of\nthe steps. Two Port Massy police officers followed her, boots clomping loudly, the brims of their\nblack caps and the shoulders of their uniforms beaded with ice. “Not a restaurant or bar,” Sana went"

Two Port Massy police officers followed her, boots clomping loudly, the brims of their\nblack caps and the shoulders of their uniforms beaded with ice. “Not a restaurant or bar,” Sana went\non. She had been calm a minute ago, but now she acted extremely nervous, wringing her hands. “This\nis just a party. A neighborhood party.”\nThe officers squinted around the basement. “A party, eh?” said the older one of them. “What’s\nthe occasion? What’re you kecks up to down here? Fighting? Jade trading?”\nSana looked horrified and insulted. “No, of course not. Maybe you’ve been watching too many\nmovies? Just because we’re Kekonese you think we all wear jade like gangsters?” She gestured\naround at the tables of people—men and women, young and old. “We can’t get together to eat and\ndrink and have a good time in our own community center on a stormy night like this, without being\nsuspected?”\nThe younger of the two officers looked a little abashed at this, but the older one strode to the\ncenter of the room and snorted at the sight of bloodstains and feathers on the ground. He lifted the\nblanket that had been thrown over one of the benches and peered down at the gamecocks in their\ncages. Straightening up again with a smug look, he said, “Cockfighting’s a criminal offense, ma’am.\nThe fine is two thousand thalirs, and we could shut this whole building down.”\nSana sucked in a breath. “Please, officers,” she said, “we will pay the fine. We don’t have much\nmoney, but we understand there are consequences to breaking the law. We’ll all pay.” As if on cue,\none of the men at the nearest table took off his felt hat and began passing it around the room. All\nthose present pulled out their wallets and deposited money into the spontaneous collection fund. Sana\nappeared on the verge of tears; she twisted the end of her scarf in her hands and said to the officers,\n“We have to hold some cockfights in here once in a while, to satisfy the older people, especially. You\nsee, it’s not illegal in our home country. They bring their gamecocks and I can’t say no all the time.\nPlease don’t revoke our licenses for this small thing.” She gave them a pleading look. “The\ncommunity center is the heart of our neighborhood, it serves everyone. There’s a shrine and library\nand daycare upstairs. There are people—some very old or very young—who come here for a meal\nand company when they have nowhere else to go. And yes, sometimes parties go on in the basement,\nbut the worst that happens is some drinking and cockfighting.”\nA girl of about ten years old ran up to Sana with the hat full of money. Sana thanked her, then\ntook the hat and counted out the cash on the nearest table. “There’s two thousand four hundred and\nfifty thalirs here,” she said, stacking the bills. “More than required, but we’ll pay extra. We just want\nto keep our community center open.” She pressed the money into the hands of the older policeman\nand smiled at the younger. “Please, officers.

Their eyes passed over Dauk Losunyin’s table with no special attention. The Pillar, like\neveryone else, was listening to what was going on, but he was slouched in his chair, his large hands\nfolded, drawing not the slightest attention to himself. Rohn Toro had not moved from his spot against\nthe wall near the door.\n“I’m going to let you off with a warning this time,” said the older cop, as if he’d considered the\nissue and come to a reluctant decision. With a show of deliberation, he stowed the money in his inside\njacket pocket. Sana sagged in visible relief. “Thank you; you are very kind,” she murmured\ngratefully.\n“You kecks better keep your noses clean and be careful about staying within the law from now\non,” said the older cop. “Jade’s illegal. You should all know that by now. If you get caught wearing or\nselling it, that’s jail time.”\nSana nodded vehemently. “We are worried about jade, too,” she insisted. She began to lead the\nofficers out of the grudge hall and back up the stairs. “The Crews, they run rackets in this part of the\ncity, and there are rumors that they want to get their hands on jade now. All Kekonese people know\nsuch a dangerous substance shouldn’t be worn by ordinary people—certainly not criminals. That’s\nwhy we need the police.” To the younger cop, “Do you like Kekonese food? Would you like some\nnoodle soup, before you have to go back out into the cold?”\nTheir voices faded up the stairs. Slowly, the tension in the grudge hall dissipated. People relaxed\nand normal conversation returned once it was clear that the police officers were gone. Rohn Toro\nwaited a minute, then sat back down.\nDauk Losun came over to their table, smiling and congenial once again. “They’ll be back. This\nhappens every few months, in the same way.” He smiled and patted Anden on the shoulder. “You look\nworried. Don’t be. The Port Massy police are like another one of the Crews: expecting payment and\ngiving little in return.”\nAnden nodded, though he didn’t really understand. It had never occurred to him to be fearful\naround the city police in Janloon. When his cousin Hilo had been Horn, he had often met with the\npolice to instruct them on where to go after petty crime, which street gangs were causing trouble,\nwhere they ought to conduct drug raids—so Anden had always thought of the police as civil servants\nwho were useful to the clans, not a hindrance to them. Apparently, in Espenia, there were a multitude\nof subjective rules and regulations that even the Pillar of Southtrap was careful to insulate himself\nagainst.\n“I should stay a little longer, to make sure everything is fine,” said the Pillar. He fished his car\nkeys from the pocket of his sweater vest and handed them to his son. “It’s late though, and I don’t\nwant the Hians to worry about Anden. Drive your friends home and come back to pick me up.”"

Drive your friends home and come back to pick me up.”\nThe Pillar’s car was a green station wagon parked in the back lot. Cory started the car and blasted the\nheater on its defrost setting while Anden and Tod scraped the front and back windshields free of ice.\nIn the car, their breaths steamed together as Cory pulled into the street and drove first Derek, and then\nTod, back to their homes. The crusty wipers scraped against glass, and the car’s headlights gleamed\non wet pavement as he navigated to the Hians’ house on the other end of Southtrap.\nOn the street corner, a block away from the house, Cory pulled the station wagon over to the\ncurb. He shut off the engine and turned to face Anden. His eyes were bright with reflected streetlight,\nbut his expression was suddenly unreadable in the dark. “You’re wondering where it is, aren’t you?”\nhe asked. “My jade.”\nHeat rose up Anden’s neck. In answer, he forced himself to look into the other young man’s\neyes. Cory unzipped his jacket. Shrugging out of it, he turned in the driver’s seat to face Anden and\nlifted his shirt. The streetlight overhead illuminated his bare torso. Anden swallowed. His eyes\ntraveled down Cory’s chest, to the trio of jade studs pierced through the man’s navel.\nAnden tried to pull his eyes away but couldn’t; his gaze continued traveling, down the line of\nthin dark hairs that disappeared under Cory’s waistband. The skin of Cory’s arms was goose-pimpling\nin the cold. Anden thought that perhaps he should say something, that maybe Cory wanted him to, but\nhe was afraid to open his mouth and say the wrong thing.\nCory didn’t speak either. He reached across the front seat and took hold of Anden’s wrist, pulling\nit forward, until the tips of Anden’s cold fingers brushed bare skin. Slowly, Anden flattened his palm\nagainst the man’s abdomen. His pulse was pounding in the palm of his hand. In the close quarters of\nthe car, he could suddenly hear his own breath, loud and unsteady.\nCory’s gaze was hungry now. He moved Anden’s hand across his bare stomach, as if guiding a\nblind reader over braille. When Anden touched the hard, smooth pieces of jade, an intensely delicious\nand slightly nauseating sensation, like that of an overripe sweetness, hit him in the back of the throat\nand fell into the pit of his gut. Cory’s jade aura throbbed into him, hot with desire, like a black rock\nbaking in the sun. Anden wanted to press himself against it, to clutch it greedily, to let it envelop him,\nbut his body remembered the taste of jade energy the way an alcoholic remembers his last drunken\nblackout—with a crooning, desperate longing and visceral repulsion. He wanted to lose himself in it;\nhe wanted to jerk away. The two impulses collided; Anden froze, his arm trembling. His eyes found\nCory’s, and he saw the confusion in his friend’s expression resolve into understanding. Gently, the\nyoung man let go of Anden’s wrist. He dropped his shirt back into place and pulled on his coat."

One of my cousins, the\nPillar… was murdered.” He had not spoken of Lan in over a year. “Even before I graduated, I wanted\nto do whatever I could to avenge him and help win the war. I… I killed a man. Someone important. A\nfew men, actually.” The words coming from his mouth sounded vague and insubstantial; he couldn’t\nimagine anyone hearing them could appreciate their meaning, certainly not someone as removed from\nthe situation as Cory Dauk.\nCory nodded slowly. “You don’t want to be a killer.”\nAnden looked up, a little surprised. That wasn’t it at all. Sometimes it was necessary to take\nlives; every member of his family had done so when it was called for. He tried to think of how he\nmight be able to explain it better, to communicate how this was different, how deeply it had affected\nhim, how tragic and elating and painful it had been. “I don’t want to enjoy it,” he said.\nCory regarded him for a long moment. He rubbed his hands together for warmth, then scooted\nover on the car’s bench seat; he was suddenly inches away from Anden, his gaze more restrained but\nstill insistent. “You’re the most interesting person I’ve met in a long time, islander.” He leaned in and\nkissed Anden on the mouth.\nCory’s lips were chilled, but his tongue was not. It slid, for an instant, over Anden’s bottom\nteeth. The kiss was over quickly, so quickly that Anden had a hard time believing that it had happened\nat all. When Cory pulled back, Anden acted almost without thinking—he reached forward and\ngrabbed the other man by the front of his coat.\nThe second kiss lasted long enough that Anden felt the blood rushing into his head, their hot\nbreaths mingling and steaming the windows, the warmth of Cory’s jade aura slipping over his skin.\nWhen they broke apart, Anden managed, “I… I thought you liked girls.”\nCory laughed. “I do.” He leaned in again, his lips pursed to one side. “And I like you, crumb.\nYou’re a paradox. You look as if you walked out of a magazine ad but you’re so damn… Kekonese."

        "text": "You’re a paradox. You look as if you walked out of a magazine ad but you’re so damn… Kekonese.\nIt’s kind of sexy.” The bridge of Cory’s nose scrunched up, his expression teasing as he slid a hand up\nAnden’s leg. “You’re not like the rest of us kespies.”\n“Kespies?” Anden said.\n“Kespenians. You know, Kekonese-Espenians.” Cory began rubbing his hand on the crotch of\nAnden’s pants. Anden sat very still, not daring to move, though it seemed all the heat in his body was\nflowing down into his groin. Cory unbuttoned the top of Anden’s pants and slid a hand under his\nwaistband. Cold fingers found their way into his pubic hair, began touching and encircling his\nstiffened cock.\nAnden made an inarticulate noise. Excitement and terror rose in him. “Wait, I…” he gasped, but\ndid not get any further; Cory unzipped Anden’s pants in one swift jerk and pulled back, lowering his\nface into Anden’s lap. Anden could not truly believe this was happening. It seemed somehow\ninappropriate to let Cory do this—he was the son of the local Pillar, to whom Anden was indebted—\nyet it also seemed wrong to try and stop him. Then he felt Cory’s mouth—the sudden, exquisite,\nflooding heat made Anden’s eyes roll back in his head—and he could no longer think clearly about\nanything.\nIt was over too quickly, for which Anden blamed himself. He would’ve wanted it to go on\nlonger, but in a way he was relieved, if also disappointed. He felt as if he’d just experienced one of\nthe most memorable moments of his life thus far, even though the release itself had not exactly been\necstatic. Furtive and unexpected, thrilling, a little uncomfortable. Cory drew back and wiped a hand\nover his mouth. Anden shivered with the shock of cold air on his wet, exposed crotch. He buttoned\nhimself up quickly, still at a loss, feeling entirely out of control.\nCory said, “You’ve never been with a man, have you?”\nWithout quite meeting the other man’s gaze, Anden shook his head. He was twenty years old and\nhad never been intimate with anyone. There was one time, on a Boat Day three years ago, when\nseveral of the students at the Academy had gone to a bar and gotten drunk and one of his female\nclassmates had kissed him for a long, booze-scented minute, putting her tongue in his mouth, but he\ndidn’t count that.\nCory leaned in and touched his lips lightly to the side of Anden’s mouth, in a strangely tender,\nchaste action. He said, “Okay. We’ll go slow, then,” which made Anden want to laugh out loud, a\nlittle hysterically, because everything that had happened this evening had been, in his opinion,\nanything but slow. The windows of the car were fogged. Large flakes of white snow had begun to fall.\nJust down the street, the lights in the Hians’ house were still on. Anden imagined Mrs. Hian waiting\nup past her bedtime at the kitchen table to make sure he made it back to the house safely in the storm,"

Anden imagined Mrs. Hian waiting\nup past her bedtime at the kitchen table to make sure he made it back to the house safely in the storm,\nand he said, “I should go.” He thought he ought to say something else, but what?\n“See you around, islander,” Cory said, smiling a little. Anden got out of the car. He drew his coat\naround himself and walked down the sidewalk. The headlights of the station wagon turned on and fell\nacross his back, throwing his shadow against the wet pavement. As he reached the front stoop of the\ntownhouse that had, after eight months, finally begun to feel like home, he heard the car start, and\nCory drove past, tires plowing through slush, before the taillights of the car turned the corner.\nCHAPTER\n23\nScrap Pickers\nB\nero stood on loose ground near the top of the slag heap. Below him on the slope, the jade pickers\nwere like ants, each one a dot crawling on the black hill of rubble, headlamps set to their dimmest\nsetting as they worked in the dark, searching. Everything was a trade-off between the need for haste\nand care. They had to work as quickly as possible, but too much light and noise might give the crew\naway. With every minute they stayed, the risk of being discovered by a patrol increased, but searching\nfor jade scrap was a patient, painstaking task. The pickers turned over each rock, prying them loose\nfrom the ground, feeling and examining them, rubbing them against the hems of dirt-encrusted shirts\nand holding them to the light to peer closely for the subtle glint that suggested an otherwise\nnondescript stone held precious jade encased within.\nA headlamp flickered twice. Bero leapt Lightly down to the man who’d signaled. He was getting\nthe hang of Lightness, could call upon it consistently now and better control his height and speed.\nLightness and Strength were the easiest disciplines for a novice to grasp, so he’d been told, because\nthey were cued by physical actions everyone was familiar with. He hadn’t managed to Deflect\nanything except by accident, and the one time he and Mudt cornered a stray dog and tried to kill it by\nChanneling, it turned on them and bit Bero on the leg—he still had the scar.\nThe scrawny Uwiwan man—all the pickers were scrawny Uwiwan men; Bero had a hard time\ntelling any of them apart—held up a rock the size of a small peach. “Jade, good jade,” he said, which\nwere probably the only two words he knew in Kekonese, and the only two necessary. He held it\nagainst his cheek for emphasis. Jade was an amplifier with no detectable energy of its own; the\npickers always pressed the rocks against their skin—they put the smaller ones in their mouths if they\ncould—hoping to feel a tingling reaction in their bodies, a rush of energy, a heightened clarity in their\nsenses. It was not a perfect indicator; the jade was often shielded by outer layers of dense rock, and\nthe desire to find worthy pieces was so great that the pickers often imagined their own reactions.\nBesides, they were so doped up on shine that their perceptions of jade were muddled anyway.

Without\nit, they risked getting the Itches if they stayed in the job too long.\nBero took the stone from the man. It was brown and dirty, utterly ordinary looking from the\noutside. With a thick white paint pen, he wrote 1124—the man’s work number, written on the top of\nhis headlamp and on the laminated card that hung on a lanyard around his neck—on the surface of the\nstone. When the rock reached the Uwiwa Islands, it would be cut open with a rock saw. If there was\njade inside, a note would be made in a ledger and the man would be paid, relatively handsomely, for\nhis find. There was perhaps a one in twenty chance this would happen—it was more often the case\nthat there was nothing inside, or that the jade was of poor quality, with flaws that made it unusable, or\nthat a glimpse of lustrous green turned out to be nothing but inert nephrite, useless for anything but\nimitation or decoration. Real Kekonese jade was one of the rarest substances in the world, and the\nmines run by the Kekon Jade Alliance took all the real finds. These were merely the scraps.\nBut the scraps had worth enough. They were worth ferrying crews of impoverished Uwiwans by\nboat to Kekon’s shores, and then by truck into the densest jungle regions of the island’s mountainous\ninterior. Worth hiring local supervisors like Bero and Mudt and paying them with money and shine,\nand if they stuck around for more than a year, with their own cut of jade. Last summer, Bero and\nMudt had been brought into a room in a disused gym along with a couple of other new rockfish\ninitiates. In front of Soradiyo and each other, each man pricked his bottom lip with a clean knife and\nkissed a slip of parchment paper with his name written on it. The papers were held together over a\ncandle, burning their wet blood and sealing their pledges of loyalty and silence to Ti Pasuiga.\nBero pretended to take it seriously, but he smirked to himself. They were acting like kids joining\na secret club, even though they were only here to get money and jade—same as what everyone\nwanted. Nothing secret or special about that.\nSoradiyo, their barukan manager, usually met them in the Rat House and gave them three to four\ndays’ notice of a nighttime scavenge so they had time to trek out to meet the loads of pickers when\nthey were trucked in. Sometimes the weather or advance warning of a Green Bone patrol caused a\nchange in plans and the job was canceled or delayed, in which case they had to pitch a tent and wait\nin the forest, eating dried food and grousing until conditions improved and the operation could\nproceed. Their job was to supervise the pickers—specifically, to make sure that none of them tried to\nsteal any of the jade they found. A poor laborer might try to hide a bit of jade in his pockets or inside\nhis cheek or up his ass crack, in the hopes of selling it himself for far more than he was paid by"

Jade-wearing foremen could Perceive unsanctioned auras among the workers. A first\nattempt resulted in a warning. A second in death. Bero hadn’t had to kill any workers yet, but Mudt\nhad. He’d had to shoot a man in the head last month, roll his body into the trees.\nBero took the marked stone and climbed up the overlooking ridge with short, Light jumps to the\nmetal rolling bin, half-full of similar stones, each marked with workers’ numbers. Mudt guarded the\nbin tonight and kept watch next to the three military trucks splattered with mud and covered with\ncamouflage-patterned tarps. Bero dropped the rock into the bin; it clattered amid the others. “How\nmuch longer have we got to do this?” Mudt griped, rubbing the outside of his arms and stamping his\nfeet. Winter was the best time to scavenge because it was usually dry, but high in these mountainous\nareas, it was bitterly cold at night, cold in a relentlessly damp and clingy way. “This is a miserable\njob, keke. We could be back in the city right now, practicing. And fucking warm.”\n“And working for shit wages in a gas station or shoe store or something? You’re grumpy because\nof the cold, but this is good money, keke. And if we keep doing it for three more months, we get\njade.” Bero’s eyes ran covetously over the rocks in the bin. “No other job is going to give us that.”\n“We have jade,” Mudt retorted. “We haven’t done anything with it except watch over these poor,\ndirty saps and freeze our asses off in the jungle. What do we need more jade for?”\n“What for?” exclaimed Bero. “What do you think?” That was like asking why a person needed\nmore food, or more money, or more women. You could never have too much; that was why the Green\nBones were always fighting each other. Sometimes Mudt asked the stupidest questions.\n“We should be training. We should be going after No Peak,” Mudt groused again, but Bero had\nstopped listening because he thought he’d heard something in the forest. The slag heap was entirely\nexposed, but dense, dark foliage surrounded them on all sides. He tried to reach out his sense of\nPerception. Staring into the darkness, his heart began to race and the night suddenly seemed to be full\nof danger.\n“They’re coming,” Mudt whispered in sudden, certain fear. An instant later, Bero sensed it as\nwell: swiftly approaching jade auras that could only belong to Green Bones. He couldn’t tell how\nmany there were or how long it would be before they arrived. In his mind, they seemed like bright\nmissiles flying through the darkness toward him.\nBero shouted, “The trucks! Get to the trucks!”\nHe seized the rolling metal bin and dragged it toward the nearest tarp-covered vehicle. He threw\nopen the back but didn’t bother to take the time to lower the metal ramp; with a heaving of Strength,\nhe tried to lift the rocks inside.

The first pickers to make it to the\nridge dove into the trucks like rabbits into a burrow, eyes wide and white in their dark faces. They\ngibbered in frantic Uwiwan, begging the Abukei drivers to start driving, while their fellows shouted\nand cried for the trucks to wait. Bero stared down the hill. The pickers who were too far away, who\nknew there was no way they’d reach the trucks in time, were running toward the forest, hoping to\nscatter and hide among the trees. They were right to be afraid. At first, the clans had beaten the\npickers and shipped them back to the Uwiwas, but that had not been enough to dissuade the\nscavenging; now the usual response was to snap the necks of any foreign thieves. Along with their\njade-wearing supervisors.\nBero sprinted for the nearest truck. Mudt had already climbed into the one behind it. “Go, go!”\nBero shouted, even as two pickers leapt for the open tailgate. One of them made it in; the other\nstumbled and fell as the truck shot forward, spraying him with mud as it left him behind. Bero stuck\nhis head out of the window and looked behind them to see half a dozen figures emerging from the\ntrees. They were moving so quickly their bodies seemed blurred, but Bero could see that they carried\nguns and moon blades.\nIf he had not been so terrified, he might’ve been awed. The scene looked like something out of a\nmovie, one in which the Green Bone rebels flew out of the jungle and ambushed the Shotarian\nsoldiers in their camp. Except that this was not a battle, but a crackdown. Gunfire broke out along\nwith distant screams as the Green Bones began to sweep the slag heap for pickers. Nothing to be done\nfor those poor bastards. Bero swiveled around to face the front again—just in time to see three men\nburst from the trees ahead and land in the road in front of them.\n“Keep going, keep going! Run them over!” Bero screamed at the driver, but any further words\ncaught in his throat as he watched the three men plant themselves in a line and throw a massive low-\nsweeping Deflection in unison. It tore across the surface of the narrow, pocked road like an amplified\nwave, flinging dirt and gravel up into the truck’s windshield. The truck’s tires skidded violently. The\ndriver tried desperately to straighten them, but the vehicle spun nearly ninety degrees and careened\noff the path. It banked in a precarious, stomach-lurching jolt, then toppled sideways into the gully full\nof rocks and bushes."

The driver landed heavily on top of him.\nIn the back, Bero could hear thuds and cries from the trapped Uwiwan workers. A few sickening\nheartbeats passed, then the door of the truck was flung open so hard it was nearly torn from its hinges.\nSeveral hands reached in and yanked out the driver, screaming, then reached back in and latched\naround Bero’s legs. Bero shouted and kicked, but his flailing, imprecise Strength did not prevent him\nfrom being pulled out of the overturned vehicle like a hooked tuna being dragged from the water.\nBero was dropped facedown on the road. He struggled to his knees as Mudt was deposited\nroughly next to him. A nauseating sense of dreadful familiarity rose in Bero’s throat; this was like that\ntime nearly three years ago when he’d been caught and beaten by the Maik brothers. He had a\ncrooked face and a limp to remind him of that encounter every day, and he had a terrible feeling that\nhe was unlikely to get off as easily this time.\nMudt spat dirt from his mouth. “Now we’re fucked, keke. This is all your fault.”\nBero blinked grit from his eyes. The lower half of the upended truck was blocking the road; the\nother two trucks had been forced to stop behind it. Green Bones were dragging pickers out of all three\nvehicles and killing them with chilling efficiency. In minutes, they were dead, thirteen in all. Bero\nsuspected the other seven in the crew were lying on the slag heap some distance behind. He\nconsidered leaping up and running for his life. With Lightness and Strength on his side, he might\nmake it, though probably not. He was just about to give it a go anyway, because what did he have to\nlose at this point, but one of the Green Bones must’ve Perceived his intentions because a pair of\nrough hands seized them by the backs of their necks. “Do anything stupid and you die, you barukan\npiss rats.”\n“We’re not barukan,” Bero protested angrily.\nA man approached. He was older than the others, his closely cropped hair receding to either side\nof a sharp widow’s peak, but his trim body moved with the lean economy of a grizzled wolf. His\npiercing eyes did not seem to blink very much. “Zapunyo doesn’t send his hired barukan to supervise\nthe scavenges, not anymore,” the man explained to the other Green Bone. “He needs them to run his\noperations in the Uwiwas and to guard his compound. The local jade-fevered shine addicts are a lot\nmore expendable.”\n“Should we kill them, then, Nau-jen?” asked the other Green Bone, his grip tightening.\nThe Horn of the Mountain studied the two kneeling teens. In the dark, Bero could not see much\nof his expression, but the man’s aura was like a low, simmering heat off baked bricks. The Horn’s\nsearching gaze settled upon the jade encircling Bero’s neck and Mudt’s arms. “That’s a lot of quality"

I took it from Kaul Lan’s body myself.”\nThere was a moment of stunned silence from the nearby Green Bones. Then they burst into\nraucous laughter that echoed over the idling engines of the stalled trucks. Nau Suen didn’t laugh, but\nhe let his men do so. After the chuckling had died down, one of the Fists said, “These new green, as\nthey call themselves, are worse than the barukan. Every one of them would have you believe they\nwon their spoils in a pitched battle when not a single one of them can use jade worth shit.”\nNau Suen turned a stern look toward the Green Bone who’d spoken. “We hooked half of these\nsorry miscreants on jade and shine in order to use them against No Peak. Why should we be surprised\nnow that Gont Asch’s discarded tools have been picked up by an opportunist like Zapunyo?” His men\nfell into chastised silence.\nNau looked back down at the two teens. “We’re not going to kill these two. We’re going to send\nthem back to their employer as an act of goodwill.” He motioned for Bero and Mudt to be released.\nBero blinked, not quite believing it enough to be relieved. Nau said to them, “Listen carefully. Tell the\nbarukan Soradiyo that as long as I keep finding and catching his scrap-picking crews, he won’t make\nmoney. Zapunyo won’t be pleased. Your manager might even soon be out of a job in the worst\npossible way. Let him know that Nau Suen, Horn of the Mountain, would like to discuss bettering his\ncareer options.”\n“You’re going to buy out Soradiyo?” Bero asked, suddenly interested now that he’d recovered\nfrom his fear. Mudt shot him an urgent look that screamed, Shut up, you want him to change his mind\nabout letting us live?\nThe Horn looked at Bero closely and curiously, as if he were a strange species of frog that had\nbeen discovered in the rain forest. Bero found the man’s gaze unnerving and began to think that\nmaybe Mudt was right; maybe he should’ve kept his mouth shut the whole time. He’d heard rumors\non the street that Nau Suen was so skilled in Perception that he could read minds. Which was stupid,\neveryone knew that was impossible, but nevertheless, Nau’s stare was so penetrating that Bero’s skin\ncrawled.\nThe Horn said, “Ask another question and I’ll rip your tongue out. You’re a dog, a messenger,\nthat’s all you are.” Nau leaned in close and spoke into Bero’s ear. “But you’re not lying. You actually\ndo believe you’re wearing Kaul Lan’s jade.

Even though it was an hour\nbefore dawn, the lights were on in the kitchen. Kyanla was stirring a pot of hot cereal at the stove.\nHilo sat at the table, cutting a nectarine into bite-sized pieces with a paring knife and putting them on\na plastic food tray in front of Niko. The toddler pushed them around, depositing more of them on the\nfloor than in his mouth. Hilo grumbled with weary patience.\nShae stood in the entry of the kitchen. Whenever she looked at Niko, she still felt a jolt—an echo\nof the shock on that evening three months ago when her brother had arrived back in Janloon with an\nexhausted two-year-old child in his arms. “Does he always wake up this early?” she asked.\n“Pretty much,” her brother said, eating the rejected fruit pieces himself. “Since I had to be up\nearly anyway, I thought I’d let Wen sleep in. She was up half the night with Ru.”\n“We have to go,” Shae said.\nHilo wiped his hands on a napkin and got up, leaving Kyanla to take his vacated spot. The boy\nignored the housekeeper’s attempts to reinterest him in breakfast and held his arms out to Shae to be\npicked up. “Auntie, auntie.”\n“Not now, Niko,” Shae said, with a stab of guilt, as she placed a consoling kiss on the top of his\nhead. Despite the shock of both his existence and his arrival, she’d loved the little boy almost at once.\nIt was impossible not to see his resemblance to Lan, not to feel a mingled pang of sadness and joy\nevery time he made an expression that reminded her of her dead brother. When Niko was fussy,\nclingy, and confused, when he began to follow her and tearfully hug her legs, she loved him all the\nmore, wanted to comfort and protect him. She suspected he had taken such a strong liking to her\nbecause she was the one in the family most similar in appearance to Eyni.\nA nondescript car and trusted driver were waiting for them at the front door. They couldn’t take\nHilo’s Duchesse Priza or any of the family’s more recognizable vehicles. The two of them sat in\nsilence as the car drove down dark streets.\nShae said, “What do we tell the clan about Niko?”\nHilo lit a cigarette and rolled down the window. “That he’s Lan’s son. That he was born overseas\nwithout our knowledge and brought back to Kekon after his mother died. What else do they need to\nknow?”\n“No one will believe it’s that simple.”"

What else do they need to\nknow?”\n“No one will believe it’s that simple.”\n“Let them believe whatever they want,” Hilo said harshly. A tense silence swelled between them.\nHilo turned his head to the window and blew out a stream of smoke. When he spoke again, the anger\nhad gone out of his voice. “I know what you’re thinking, Shae, but it didn’t happen like that. I tried to\nwork things out differently. You remember Eyni, what she was like.”\n“She used to be Lan’s wife,” Shae said quietly. “She was Niko’s mother.”\nShae had not been close to Eyni, but they had been on cordial terms before Shae had left for\nEspenia. She struggled to even remember the woman clearly now, to describe her better in her own\nmind, so that when she knelt in the sanctum of the Temple of Divine Return and asked the gods to\nrecognize her father and her grandfather and her eldest brother—all of them gone from this world to\nawait the Return—she could pray consideration for her former sister-in-law as well. When she\nfinished naming those who’d passed on, she pleaded forgiveness for her brother. What Hilo had done\nwent against the Divine Virtues, but Lan’s son would be cared for and loved, she promised it on her\nsoul. And hadn’t the family suffered enough already? Don’t punish us further, she begged.\nHilo finished his cigarette and rolled the window back up. “Would you rather I’d given Niko\nup?” When Shae failed to answer, he leaned back in his seat. “That’s what I thought.”\nThey arrived at the harborfront. It had not been easy to arrange a meeting with Ven Sandolan,\npresident and chief executive officer of K-Star Freight and patriarch of one of the country’s most\nprominent Green Bone families, in a place where there was no chance of the conversation being\nobserved by members of either the Mountain or No Peak clans. The deck of a private yacht moored in\nSummer Harbor was probably as neutral and secure a location as could be expected.\nVen Sando was an avid boater and known for taking his fourteen- meter-long motorboat\nInheritance out every Sixthday morning. They were on the water by sunrise. Ven Sando came\naccompanied by his eldest son, Haku, a first-rank Fist in the Mountain. Haku manned the cockpit\nwhile the elder Ven stood at the railing with his tanned face turned toward the ocean, his gray hair\nblasted back by wind and salt spray, expounding to his guests on the horsepower, speed, and fuel\ncapacity of the Inheritance and how he’d once spent four weeks sailing along the coast of Tun. Shae\nlistened politely, if impatiently, as Ven toured them around the boat, beaming with pride as Hilo ran a\nhand appreciatively over the furniture and the built-in wet bar behind the helm.\nVen Haku steered the craft around the far side of Gosha Island before cutting the engines,\nleaving only the sound of water slapping gently against the hull and the distant rumble of airplanes\ntaking off and landing from Janloon International Airport. A thin layer of haze sat over the city’s\nwaterfront and diffused the morning light, but overhead, the late autumn sky was blue and cloudless"

A thin layer of haze sat over the city’s\nwaterfront and diffused the morning light, but overhead, the late autumn sky was blue and cloudless\nexcept for the fading contrails of recently passed fighter planes, coming or going from one of the\nseveral Espenian aircraft carriers in the area. Shae pulled her sweater tight to cut the chill.\n“This isn’t the first time I’ve had members of the No Peak clan aboard.” Ven Sando possessed\nthe cheerfully overbearing manner of a man who felt he’d earned every penny of his wealth and a\nbelly paunch that suggested he saw no reason not to enjoy it. He gestured them into the boat’s lounge\nand settled comfortably into one of the white deck chairs. “About eight years ago, I met Kaul Sen at a\nfundraiser for the Janloon Arts Council and offered to take him and a few others on a cruise around\nLittle Button the very next morning. He was such an interesting man, wonderful company, your\ngrandfather. Relations between our clans were much more cordial at that time. Kaul Sen and Ayt Yu\nhad differences, but there was always respect back then.”\nHilo’s smile approximated his usual easy and open expression but did not quite reach his eyes. “I\nhope our clans will be on such friendly terms again someday.” He seated himself across from Ven.\nShae positioned a deck chair slightly to the right and behind her brother; Ven Haku mirrored the\nposition next to his father. Hilo ran a meaningful gaze over the meeting’s participants and their\nsurroundings. “Here we are, the Mountain and No Peak, so it would seem this is a good start.”\n“I’d like to agree with you,” Ven said mildly, folding his hands over his stomach, “except that\nI’m not the Pillar and can’t speak for my clan. And neither are any of the other members of the\nMountain that you’ve been talking to.” Ven’s eyebrows rose in wary inquiry. “It seems as if No Peak\nis a cock courting many hens.”\nFour months ago, following the discussion at the Kaul family dinner table about Ayt’s potential\nsuccessors, Shae had sent a large bouquet of glory hibiscus and dancing star lilies, symbolizing\nprosperity and friendship, to the office of Iwe Kalundo, to congratulate him and his family on\nassuming the office of Weather Man of the Mountain.\nSix weeks later, shortly after his return from Lybon, Hilo had paid a visit to Kaul Dushuron\nAcademy and met with Grandmaster Le. That week, nine-year-old Koben Ato was offered admission\nand a full scholarship to attend the Academy—an uncommon occurrence, reserved for prospective\nstudents demonstrating unusual early talent.\nThe Academy’s obvious attempt to poach Ayt Yu’s grandson from Wie Lon Temple School was\nmet with a flat decline by the Koben family—they would be insane to defect from the Mountain’s\nfeeder school and the alma mater of the entire Ayt family, no matter how generous the financial\nincentives—and the bouquet sent to Iwe garnered only a curt note of polite thanks, but both actions\naccomplished their purpose of drawing attention to the Iwe and Koben families, inflaming speculation\nthat No Peak was looking past the current Pillar of the Mountain and toward the next one. It had been\nHilo and Shae’s intention that Ven be aware of these actions before their meeting."

It had been\nHilo and Shae’s intention that Ven be aware of these actions before their meeting.\nHilo spread his hands unapologetically. “I want to be on good terms with whoever leads the\nMountain after Ayt Madashi. Our clans declared peace, but I don’t trust Ayt to keep it. I’m thinking of\nmy own family, of course. Ayt whispered my name and is the reason my brother is dead, so I won’t\nsleep well until she’s stepped down or been moved aside by a deserving successor.”\nVen sat forward. “That’s the whole problem right there,” he said, with conspiratorial vehemence.\n“Ayt has no succession plan. She became the Pillar by killing the rightful male heir, and now she’s\ntoo old to have children even if she could find a man who would dare to marry her.” Ven’s voice\ngained heat. “The Mountain wouldn’t be facing this problem if our Pillar was a man with a wife who\ncould give him sons. The clan needs a strong Green Bone family bloodline that can be trusted for\ngenerations.” He gestured to Hilo. “You have that in No Peak, to your credit. We don’t. We’re being\nled by a childless woman pursuing her own ambitions—that’s how low the once great clan of the\nSpear of Kekon has fallen.”\nShae was astounded. Even Hilo’s eyes widened slightly. Ayt Mada was their enemy, and Shae\nwould not have hesitated to describe her as power-hungry, but they had not expected to hear Ven\nspeak of his own Pillar in such an openly disrespectful manner. Shae’s first reaction was suspicion;\nwas Ven trying to ingratiate himself with them? Or was he truly so guileless?\nVen held up his hands as if to check his own tirade. “Don’t misunderstand me,” he said hastily,\nglancing at Shae sideways before returning his attention to Hilo. “I don’t have anything against\nwomen being Green Bones and holding positions of responsibility in valuable supporting roles. But\nthe Pillar is different. The spine of the body, as we all say. Ayt has made misstep after misstep:\nallowing jade and shine to be used by common criminals, inviting public scandal upon us, and getting\nus into a costly street war that, if you’ll forgive me for saying so, most people in the Mountain\nthought we should’ve easily won.” Ven puckered his mouth. “When I raise valid criticisms—\nunselfishly, I might add—she stubbornly refuses to address them. My very life might be in danger if\nthat woman knew I was conversing with you.” Despite this statement, Ven did not seem fearful to be\nvoicing opposition. Shae suspected that K-Star Freight was too big and important to the Mountain,\nand the Ven family too well known and powerful, for Ayt Mada to simply whisper their names and\nmake them disappear, no matter how condemnatory Ven was.\n“I’m glad we’re having this meeting, Ven-jen. You’re obviously the right person for me to be\ntalking to.” Hilo leaned back in his deck chair, angling himself more directly toward the Vens with a\nsubtle shift of his body.

He seemed to expand and relax, as if he’d occupied this very seat on the boat\ncountless times in the past, and his voice took on the quality of contented camaraderie established at\nonce between new friends who’ve discovered they grew up on the same street corner. The change\noccurred so smoothly and naturally that Shae found herself feeling as if she had suddenly become an\nuninvited guest sitting uncomfortably apart from the three men, who now possessed a familiarity they\nhad not shared mere seconds ago.\nHilo’s voice lowered. “I’m glad to learn there are people in the Mountain who want change as\nmuch as you and me, Ven-jen, but speaking as an outsider, it seems to me the Koben family doesn’t\nhave any strong leaders, just a little boy. I’m not patient enough to wait twenty years for things to\nimprove, and I can tell you’re not a complacent person yourself. Naturally, I was curious about the\nnew Weather Man, but from asking around, I hear the Iwes follow Ayt Mada blindly.”\nVen snorted. “That’s true, and also there’s too much thin blood in that family.”\n“In these uncertain times,” Hilo said somberly, “cooperation between the clans is important to\nthe country. That’s why I wanted to meet with you in private, to see if we could help each other. The\nVen family is known and respected by everyone, on the business side and on the streets. That old\nsaying, ‘Gold and jade, never together’—it sounds nice, but who can argue that we don’t need both\nfor our families to be truly strong?” Hilo fixed the overweight businessman with a stare of strict\nconfidence. “You’re obviously a man of principle, and maybe it’s not your wish to take on so much\nresponsibility, but since this issue in the Mountain clan affects not just my own family but all of\nKekon, I feel that I have to be honest. No Peak would gladly recognize the leadership of the Ven\nfamily. I can’t think of anyone I’d rather see succeed Ayt Mada.”\nVen’s jade aura gave a perceptible pulse of gratification, but he let out a dramatic sigh and waved\na hand vaguely over his shoulder, dismissing the idea as if he’d been told it so many times already\nthat he was tired of having to disappoint people. The gesture struck Shae as so contrived and self-\nimportant that she was forced to mask a stab of deep dislike. Ven said, “I’m flattered, Kaul-jen, I truly\nam, but I have a company to run, and besides, I’m getting to be an old man, nearly retired. People\nalways expect the Pillar to be green.” The only jade Ven wore was a heavy gold watch with a jeweled\ncase. “Wearing so much jade—that’s for young men. It would suit the clan best to have a leader who’s\nin his prime, who has the right image but also the backing of family resources and social capital.\nMyself, I’m content to simply be the voice of age and wisdom in the background.”\nShae looked past Ven Sando to his son. She saw Hilo’s eyes shift in that direction as well.

He wore his hair gelled back and\nhis jade studded on a bold black leather choker around his neck, like a gem-encrusted dog collar. He\nsat partly slouched, with an alert but slightly scornful expression on his face, and even the low, steady\nbuzz of his jade aura seemed to emanate privilege and insolence. For a strange, disconcerting\nmoment, looking at Ven Haku and his perfectly unlined face, Shae was reminded of the Hilo she’d\nknown six or seven years ago.\nVen Sando intended to install his son as Pillar after Ayt Mada was gone. Hilo looked between the\nelder and younger Ven and inclined his head with a half-concealed smile. “A dutiful son and\nsupportive father working together? I’m not sure any clan has ever been so fortunate.” Hilo’s jade\naura, normally so bright and expressive, hummed as smoothly as a wide river, betraying almost\nnothing. “I’d like to help bring about such a change. But Ayt Mada and I sat together in front of both\nour clans and the public and declared truce. I don’t break my promises, not even to my enemies. I\nhave to make that clear before we talk further.”\nVen Sando gave Hilo a shrewd look. “No one wants another street war between the clans. But\nyou wouldn’t have asked to meet unless you had something to give besides encouragement.”\nHilo’s manner hardened a touch, into formality, and he spoke more slowly. “Ayt Mada will never\nstep down willingly. She’ll have to be forced out. When you move against her, No Peak will offer you\nour friendship and complete support, against those who might be resistant or who would take\nadvantage of the transition when it comes about, and there are always those people. That’s not a small\nthing and I don’t promise it lightly. There are also the people who need to have practical reasons to\naccept a new leader. There are things that my Weather Man can do to help you persuade them.”\nThe prompt caught Shae off guard for an instant; she’d begun to think with some annoyance that\nHilo had forgotten she was even there. “K-Star Freight is one of Kekon’s largest and most profitable\ncompanies, so I imagine you already hold a great deal of sway in the Mountain,” she said to Ven,\nlaying the flattery on a little thick. “Even so, some of your potential supporters might be encouraged\nif they knew there were financial incentives involved. No Peak’s influence in certain industries might\nbe of interest to those who can’t normally take advantage of it. There are even parts of our business\nwhere we would be open to discussing purchase offers or partnerships… if the clans were on\nfriendlier terms. Naturally, that’s information we expect you would share judiciously.”\nVen appeared to consider all of these assurances before blowing out a heavy breath, as if coming\nto a difficult but inevitable decision. “What we’re talking about would not be easy to accomplish. Ayt\ncarries a great deal of jade and surrounds herself with those who are loyal to her. It would take time"

Ayt\ncarries a great deal of jade and surrounds herself with those who are loyal to her. It would take time\nand planning to bring about the sort of change we want to see. But knowing that I have the promise of\nyour friendship, Kaul-jen—it fills me with determination to fix what’s wrong with the Mountain, and\nto put things right between our clans.”\nSo there it was: Ven would secretly garner the support for a coup within the Mountain clan. If\nsuccessful, such a thing would almost certainly end in the death of Ayt Mada and her inner circle. No\nPeak would quietly back the usurpers with bribes, payouts, and financial concessions in addition to,\nwhen the time came, the might of their Fists and Fingers to help put down Ayt’s supporters.\nAfterward, the Ven family would control the Mountain, and there would be true and lasting friendship\nbetween the clans, not merely the cynical truce that currently existed.\nHilo said, “I look forward to the future, Ven-jen.”\nVen clapped his hands together, then ended the meeting by getting up, going to the wet bar, and\npouring two glasses of hoji. “Surely you already know this, Kaul-jen, but within the Mountain clan,\nyou have a bloodthirsty reputation. And your lovely sister is said to be a coldhearted Espenian\nsympathizer. It just goes to show what sorts of lies people spread about their enemies. I can see for\nmyself that you’re an upstanding and reasonable man, just like your grandfather, someone who’s easy\nto work with.” He and Hilo drank in recognition of their new alliance.\nVen Sando offered to sail them around some more and host them for lunch, but Shae played the\npart of the Pillar’s anxious aide by suggesting it was best that they return before anyone in No Peak\nbecame concerned by their absence. As the president of K-Star regaled the Kauls with a few more\nsailing stories, interspersed with the occasional anecdote about the freight shipping industry, Ven\nHaku steered the Inheritance back to the private dock where the Kauls’ car and driver were waiting.\nWhen the Pillar and his Weather Man were alone together in the moving vehicle again, Shae\ncould no longer contain herself. “Ven Sando might be the most conceited, insufferable boor I’ve ever\nmet,” she exclaimed.\n“Does it make you feel sorry for Ayt?” Hilo grinned broadly and stretched his legs out into her\nside of the seat well, propping his shoes on top of her feet. She kicked them off, as if they were still\nchildren bickering over space in the back of Grandda’s car while Lan growled at them from the front\nto leave each other alone. Hilo threw an arm over his sister’s shoulder. His mood had changed\ncompletely from the earlier dark car ride, and the easy friendliness he’d shown to the men on the boat\nhad vanished; his lopsided smile was bright and feral. “Ven and his son put together would be less\nthan half the Pillar that Ayt is. This is how we win, Shae. We get the Mountain to tear itself apart\nunder Ayt’s feet.”\nThere were times Shae was forced to admit that perhaps Grandda would’ve better appreciated"

Kehn did not particularly like being on the water, especially given the cold drizzle of rain\nflying in his face; he would much rather be on the familiar streets of Janloon—the noisy, dirty streets\nthat he and his Green Bones ruled. But the clans needed to protect and patrol far beyond the city these\ndays—up in the mountains, along the coast, even hundreds of kilometers out to sea. Kehn suspected\nthat he might be the first Horn, at least in his generation, to hijack a ship in international waters. That\nwas part of his job, though, adapting to the enemy’s moves—and he’d learned from Kaul Hilo to\nalways lead from the front.\nJuen, his First Fist, fired the grappling hook, which went sailing over the railing of the cargo ship\nand caught, tethering their motorboat. Unlike some large men, Kehn had no difficulty with Lightness;\nseizing the taut rope, he swung his feet onto it and ran halfway up its length like a lizard on a thin\nbranch, crossing the last few meters to the ship’s deck in a bound. He landed quietly, talon knife\ndrawn.\nTwo men armed with handguns were running toward the railing. To his surprise, Kehn sensed\njade auras, shrill with hostility and alarm. At the sight of him, they stopped and opened fire. The Horn\nleapt straight for the guards, releasing tight twin Deflections that cleared his path as he went airborne\nand landed between them. He clamped onto the barrel of the nearest weapon with his left hand,\ntwisting it away from the gunman with a burst of Strength as he hurled the man on the right backward\nwith a Deflection that sent him crashing across the rain-slicked deck into the nearest metal wall of\nstacked containers.\nKehn tossed the gun overboard; its former owner drew twin triangle-headed durbh daggers—\nfighting knives of the Uwiwa Islands—and came at the Horn with vicious, swift stabs. Kehn hooked\nand controlled the man’s left wrist with his talon knife and caught the blade of the right-hand dagger\nwith his Steeled hand. His opponent reacted instantly, letting go of the weapon and driving his fist\ninto Kehn’s solar plexus with enough Strength that the air went out of Kehn’s lungs with a painful\ngrunt. He felt the telltale flex in his opponent’s jade aura as the man gathered himself to Channel a\nlethal blow.\nKehn battened his torso with Steel; the durbh blade he’d caught in his hand cut sharp into\nsuddenly unprotected skin. Dropping it, he Channeled first, fast and quick, a nonlethal jab to the\nheart, just enough to shock. Grabbing a fistful of the man’s shirt, he let out a bellow as he shoved,"

Grabbing a fistful of the man’s shirt, he let out a bellow as he shoved,\nthen yanked forward hard, whiplashing his opponent’s face into a head butt that connected with an\naudible crack. The Horn dug his shoulder into the limp man’s chest and heaved, sending him over the\nship’s railing and tumbling into the white-capped water far below.\nKehn turned around. His Fists, Juen and Iyn, and two Fingers, Lott and Dudo, had leapt to board\nthe ship right behind him, leaving one Finger, Ton, behind to man the motorboat. Iyn was stalking\nafter the second guard as he tried to stumble away from her with a broken leg. As she drew her moon\nblade, Kehn ordered, “Leave him alive for now.” It occurred to him that he shouldn’t have thrown the\nother one into the sea; now the man’s jade, even if it was not much, was at the bottom of the ocean. At\nleast it was no longer being worn and used disgracefully by a hired half bone cur.\nHe strode down the deck of the ship between fifteen-meter-tall walls of red, orange, and blue\nshipping containers uniformly stacked like his nephew’s building blocks. The three-hundred-meter-\nlong cargo vessel was too large for him to be able to Perceive everyone aboard, but he knew his Fists\nand Fingers would split up to sweep the ship; they would find and kill any additional barukan guards\nand round up the crew. Kehn wrapped his hand in the hem of his shirt, putting pressure on it to stop\nthe bleeding as he headed toward the bridge.\nTwenty minutes later, the captain and his officers were gathered together in the ship’s dining\nroom. The captain was a man of about forty with a curly orange beard and sideburns—Captain\nBamivu eya Kijdiva, according to his nameplate—an Ygutanian, like several of his officers. The crew,\nwhich had been rounded up and placed in the mess hall, was mostly Uwiwan. Though Kijdiva acted\nadmirably calm, sweat stood out on his brow and Kehn could Perceive his heart beating much faster\nthan normal. He obviously didn’t know anything about Green Bones and thought his ship had been\nattacked by pirates who might steal his cargo or harm his crew.\n“Don’t worry, no one will be hurt,” Kehn said. Either the man did not understand or was not put\nat ease by the assurance. “You speak any other languages?” Kehn asked. “Uwiwan? Espenian?”\nThe captain spoke passable Espenian, which was fortunate as Lott also had a decent grasp on the\nlanguage, having studied it during his years at the Academy. That seemed to be popular these days;\nwith more foreigners and foreign businesses in Janloon, it was useful even for Fingers to know\nanother language besides Kekonese. Kehn asked Lott to translate. “Tell him we want to see the ship’s\nregistration and freight manifest.”\nAfter some back and forth, the requested documents were brought over from the bridge. The MV\nAmaric Pride, owned and operated by an Ygutanian company but registered in the Uwiwa Islands,\nhad left Tialuhiya two days ago, bound for the northern port city of Bursvik in Ygutan.

Normally,\nships bound for Ygutan went south around Shotar and through the Origas Gulf, but the waters near\nOortoko were currently a war zone full of Shotarian, Espenian, and Ygutanian warships.\nKehn frowned as he flipped through the manifest. The ship was carrying nearly twenty thousand\ntons of cargo—apparel, consumer goods, canned fruit. There was no way to search it all. The captain\nasked a question, and Lott said, “He wants to know if we killed those men, the four guards.”\nJuen and the others had encountered two other barukan as they took over the ship. “Those men\nworked for a smuggler in the Uwiwa Islands,” Kehn said to the captain, not answering his question.\n“Do you know what they were guarding?”\nThe captain swallowed. “I didn’t ask questions,” he said, through Lott. “I was paid for their\npassage. It’s typical for us to have four to ten paying passengers aboard. I don’t know what’s in the\nboxes; I never see any of it. I just move it.”\nKehn left the captain and officers under Juen’s guard and went back up onto the deck with Lott.\nThe sky was still spitting weak, intermittent rain, but the sun had come up now. The barukan that Iyn\nhad left alive was tied to the railing, his leg bent at a disturbing angle, his face a sickly hue. Iyn had\nstripped him of his jade. The Fist was sighing with disappointment as she leaned against a nearby\ncontainer, pulling the links of the gemstone necklace apart and flinging the nephrite pieces into the\nocean, pausing only to pocket two pieces of real green. Junior Fists like Iyn were the most anxious to\nprove themselves, vying with their peers to gain additional jade, territory, responsibility, and Fingers\nto command. Kehn made a mental note to himself to give her another chance to earn jade sooner\nrather than later. He’d come to realize that the bulk of the Horn’s role was managing people, and\nalthough he wasn’t naturally gifted with the personal warmth and magnetism of his predecessor, he\ntried to always pay attention to those under his command and be strict but fair in his decisions. After\ntwo grueling years in the job, he’d become more secure in his own leadership and knew his warriors\nrespected him.\nStanding in front of the injured barukan man, Kehn said, “Do you speak Kekonese?” When the\nman nodded, the Horn got straight to the point: “Which container is it in?”\n“I don’t know,” the man said. “Zapunyo doesn’t pay me to know things. Kill me and be done\nwith it.”\n“I’m not going to kill you,” Kehn said. “Your leg is badly broken, but it’s a clean break; if I ask\nthe ship’s doctor to come out and set it, you’ll heal and be able to walk again. Or I can have Lott and\nIyn here turn it into pebbles in a skin bag, and your other leg as well, then drop you back off in the\nUwiwa Islands as a cripple to see what use Zapunyo has for you then.”"

Who break the silence of Ti Pasuiga?”\nHis teeth began to chatter as the wind chilled his wet clothes and sweat-drenched skin. “First, he cuts\noff the feet, then the hands, and finally the head, and he has the parts buried in different places so you\nwon’t be whole even in the afterlife.”\n“That’s because he’s an animal,” said Kehn. “We can get you away from Zapunyo. How do you\nthink we knew about this shipment if we didn’t already have informers that we protect? Also, we have\nthe support of the Espenians; they’re at war and want to stop the smuggling as well, to prevent their\nenemies from getting any stronger. You want to start a new life somewhere far away from Zapunyo’s\ngrasp? Or you want the other option? I’m going to have a smoke while you think about it.” Kehn\npaced away.\nHe did, indeed, light a cigarette and walk out of sight to enjoy it. Behind him, he heard Iyn say,\n“I’m inclined to break your other leg just for wasting Maik-jen’s time. He’s a patient man, but he\ndoesn’t like to talk much, so he’s being extra generous with you and you’re not taking it seriously,\nyou barukan dog fucker.”\nLott said, “Iyn-jen, there’s no need to insult him when he’s in that state.” Speaking to the man in\na concerned tone, he added, “Personally, I hope you decide to cooperate. I don’t see what loyalty you\nowe to Zapunyo that’s worth this much suffering, and I don’t really want to make things worse for\nyou, although naturally I’ll do it if that’s what I have to.” This was said with just the right amount of\nsympathy, reasonableness, and cold certitude. Kehn made a satisfied noise to himself; Lott Jin had\nhad a shaky beginning as a Finger, but following Hilo’s instruction that he be placed under the\ntutelage of good mentors, the young man had come a long way and his attitude was much improved.\nWhile Kehn waited, giving the captive a few more minutes, he considered how to propose\nmarriage to Lina. He knew she would accept, as they had spoken of it already. It was the right time;\nhe was an oldest son and hoped to father children of his own soon. As a generally private man, he\nwould personally prefer a small, simple wedding but knew that would not be possible; the marriage of\nthe Horn would be a clan event. All the political considerations and turns of fortune that affected the\nKaul family affected the Maiks as well.\nWhen Kehn finished his cigarette, he returned and demanded an answer.

Crew members were brought out\nto operate the shipboard crane to move the indicated six-meter-long container off its stack. When the\ncorrugated blue metal box was opened on deck, Kehn saw it was packed full of cardboard cartons.\nThe first several boxes they inspected contained hundreds of individually poly-wrapped items of\nclothing—exercise pants, tank tops, swimwear—straight from the garment factories in the Uwiwa\nIslands. Then Iyn noticed that some of the boxes appeared to have an extra bar code on the side. Kehn\nopened one of them and held up a woman’s blouse with small green buttons down the front. The\nbuttons were made of jade and the blouse was false—it didn’t even open at the front. The whole box\nwas filled with jade, disguised as mere ornamentation. Nestled in layers of fabric and mixed in with\nthousands of items of clothing, the gems would easily evade casual inspection until someone on the\nreceiving end in Ygutan took delivery on behalf of a fictitious retailer and collected a fortune in jade.\n“That Uwiwan is a clever dog,” Kehn admitted in a grumble, standing among a mess of boxes,\nplastic, and fabric. He left his Green Bones in charge of the continuing search and went to the bridge\nto order the captain to change course; the MV Amaric Pride would be docking in Janloon’s Summer\nHarbor.\nCHAPTER\n26\nSetting Expectations\nT\nhe news was vaguely reported in the Ygutanian papers and not at all outside that country’s borders,\nbut according to the translated articles Shae received from the clan’s contacts in Ygutan, several\ntargeted bombings had occurred in the past week, destroying chemical factories near Dramsk, Nitiyu,\nand Bursvik. The Ygutanian Directorate was blaming the attacks on Shotarian loyalist groups from\nOortoko, backed by the Espenian government. The articles did not reveal who owned or operated the\nfacilities nor what they were producing that would make them the targets of sabotage, but Shae\nalready knew. The Espenians wouldn’t offer to pay for something if they didn’t plan to use it; she’d\nmet with Ambassador Mendoff and Colonel Deiller in the White Lantern Club eight months ago, and\nnow the Mountain’s lucrative shine-producing facilities were destroyed.\nAyt Mada must be furious. A satisfied smile crept onto Shae’s face and hovered there before\nsliding off. No Peak had not acted against the Mountain’s operations directly, but Ayt was sure to\ndeduce who had sold the information to the Espenians. Shae did not for an instant regret what she’d\ndone; she’d dealt a staggering financial blow to the Mountain without risking any No Peak lives or\nbusinesses, prevented vast quantities of the poisonous drug that had killed Lan from ever reaching the\nblack market, and strengthened the alliance with the Espenians without giving in to their demands for\nmore jade. It was precisely the sort of cunning victory that her grandfather would’ve been proud of."

It was precisely the sort of cunning victory that her grandfather would’ve been proud of.\nThe only problem was that Ayt was sure to retaliate. Shae didn’t know when or how it would happen,\nbut the Mountain would find a way.\nShae called Woon into her office and asked him to arrange another meeting with Colonel Leland\nDeiller. “Tell the colonel we have additional information of military interest to him.”\nWoon sat down in front of her desk. After his attempt to resign as her chief of staff, several\nweeks of unspoken awkwardness had lingered between them, but it had faded under the pervasive\nnecessity of their working relationship. Shae was glad that Woon seemed comfortable around her\nagain. She was grateful they were still friends, even if things were not the same as before. “Maik\nKehn’s discovery of jade being smuggled from the Uwiwa Islands to Ygutan on commercial cargo\nships,” Woon inferred. “You believe if we hand over that information to the Espenians, they’ll shut it\ndown, the way they destroyed the shine factories in Ygutan.”\n“Kehn and his Fists got lucky with a tip-off on that one ship, but they can’t possibly patrol the\nentire West Tun Sea. The Espenians can, and do,” Shae said. “Even though we have informers and\nagents in the Uwiwa Islands, we have little power there—less ever since Hilo caused a publicized\nbloodbath. Espenia, though, provides the bulk of that country’s foreign aid; they could force the\nUwiwan government to crack down on Zapunyo’s activities when no one else can.”\nWoon nodded. “We get them to solve our problems.”\n“Ayt Mada’s nationalistic rhetoric aside, we have interests in common with the ROE,” Shae said.\n“We don’t want jade or shine on the black market, and neither do they.”\n“Because they want it all to themselves,” Woon said. “You have to be careful, Shae-jen. Working\nwith the Espenians is like sleeping next to a tiger—it seems like a good idea until the tiger gets\nhungry, and the Espenians aren’t a subtle people. There’s over a hundred thousand of them on Euman\nIsland now, and we’re fielding complaints from Lantern Men about Espenian soldiers on shore leave\nin Janloon causing problems in casinos and brothels. The news is reporting rising civilian casualty\nfigures in Oortoko, and the world is blaming it on Espenian involvement. Given public opinion these\ndays, we don’t want No Peak to seem too cozy with the foreigners.”\nShae couldn’t disagree, especially since she knew some people, inside and outside of the clan,\nalready viewed her as an Espenophile for her foreign education. Meanwhile, Ayt Mada was\ncapitalizing on the Oortokon War, excoriating foreigners in general and Espenians in particular,\nraising her own public profile and popularity.\nShae could understand people’s temptation to buy into Ayt’s bellicose arguments, but she\ncouldn’t agree with it. Ayt’s calculated sentiments led down a well-worn path toward ethnocentric\nisolationism. Kekon had come from that centuries ago but could never return to it, not with modern"

Kekon had come from that centuries ago but could never return to it, not with modern\ntechnology and global trade and people such as Maro. “You’re right to be cautious, Papi-jen,” Shae\nsaid to her aide, “but you encouraged me to open more doors for our Lantern Men, and Espenia is\nwhere we can do that.”\n“What you say makes sense,” Woon said slowly, “but the more ties we have with that country,\nthe more leverage they’ll have over us as well. They may use that in the future, in ways that we don’t\nknow about yet and that might be costly to us. And how do you know the foreigners will even come\nthrough? Mendoff and Deiller haven’t yet delivered on anything you asked for in the White Lantern\nClub.”\n“Which is why I’m doubling down,” Shae said. “The Espenians treasure their reputation as\ndirect and honest businesspeople, and they view indebtedness and poverty as moral failings.\nProviding them another gift before they’ve repaid me for the first will make them uncomfortable.\nThey’ll be motivated to fix that imbalance soon.”\nWoon stood and took his leave. “I’ll arrange the meeting as you requested, Shae-jen, but I’ll\nkeep it quiet. Not everyone in the clan agrees with us.”\nThat evening, Shae had Maro, Hilo, and Wen over for dinner at her house. She’d considered inviting\nMaro to a family meal at the main Kaul house, but perhaps meeting the entire family, including the\nchildren and the Maiks, would be too much at once. Besides, the main house was the Pillar’s\nresidence, and she thought that might send the wrong signal as to the nature of this get together. She\nruled out meeting at a restaurant where people might see them and start speculating about when the\nTorch’s granddaughter would be getting married and having children.\nShae had never seriously taken to cooking, but with Kyanla’s help, she put together what she\nthought was a presentable meal of pickled radish salad, ginger egg soup, and baked red chicken\nglazed with chili sauce. She’d instructed Hilo to show up fifteen minutes before Maro, because she\nwanted to talk with him first and make a few things clear.\n“I’m not bringing my boyfriend home for your inspection,” she told her brother, when he and\nWen arrived and Wen went into the dining room to help Kyanla set out plates. “Maro seems to think\nthat because he doesn’t wear much jade and isn’t a member of the clan, I’m reluctant for him to meet\nmy family. That’s not true; I meant to do this much earlier, but with all our schedules—he’s been\ntraveling, we’ve been busy, and now with Niko and Ru to take care of—there hasn’t been any time.\nSo we’re finally getting a chance, but it’s just dinner.”\n“What are you so nervous about?” Hilo said, with a teasing smile that irritated her because she\nwas not nervous, she simply wanted to set expectations. “You think I’m going to interrogate him?\nMake him fight me? Wen and I are just glad to have an excuse to get away from the kids for a few\nhours.”"

        "text": "Make him fight me? Wen and I are just glad to have an excuse to get away from the kids for a few\nhours.”\nThe Fingers who guarded the gates of the Kaul estate had been told to admit Shae’s boyfriend\nwhen he arrived. Maro showed up wearing a new shirt under his suede jacket and bearing an\nexpensive bottle of premium hoji. He kissed Shae chastely on the cheek and saluted Hilo deeply to\nshow proper respect. “Kaul-jen.”\nIt bothered Shae more than she thought it would, to see Maro acting deferential toward her\nbrother. “Shae tells me that you’re a professor, so I ought to call you Dr. Tau,” Hilo said with a smile,\n“but we’re all friends here, so I’ll drop the formality if you do.” He accepted and admired the gift\n(tactfully neglecting to mention that the Cursed Beauty distillery was owned by his former Fist and\nthus the Kaul family could get as much of this hoji as it could want) and, putting a hand on Maro’s\nshoulder, led him inside to introduce him to Wen.\nDinner was more relaxed than Shae had anticipated. The food had turned out fine—quite good,\neven, no doubt thanks to Kyanla’s help. Hilo was perfectly casual and disarming in the way that he\ncould be when he wished, and Shae was grateful for her sister-in-law’s presence because Wen kept\nthe conversation going by warmly asking Maro about his teaching work and his published papers on\npostcolonial Kekon-Shotar relations. Maro had recently returned from a two-week trip to Leyolo City,\nwhere he’d given a series of guest lectures at the Imperial University and conducted some research at\nthe national archives. Shae knew his frequent professional trips were also covert opportunities for him\nto visit the Shotarian side of his family.\nThe only truly awkward moment of the evening came about inadvertently, when Wen asked\nMaro, with genuine interest, “Maro-jen, since you’re a respected advisor to the Royal Council, would\nyou ever consider pursuing a career in politics yourself?”\nMaro took a sip of hoji before answering. “The thought has crossed my mind,” he admitted. The\nlong-standing prohibition against Green Bones holding political office meant that he would have to\nvoluntarily give up his jade to run for the Royal Council, a hardship that dissuaded the vast majority\nof Academy graduates from government ambitions. “I enjoy teaching and research, but I also want to\nmake more of a difference in national policy.”\n“Maro’s been getting involved in nonprofit work, addressing humanitarian issues related to the\nwar in Oortoko,” Shae mentioned.\n“That’s very admirable,” Wen said with a smile. “And the fact that you speak Kekonese,\nEspenian, and Shotarian—that must be quite an advantage in your career.”\nHilo refilled their guest’s hoji cup and said, encouragingly, “With Chancellor Son retiring next\nyear, we could use more No Peak councilmen in Wisdom Hall.”\nMaro did not respond right away; he rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably. “I don’t have\nplans to run for public office any time soon, but if I did, I would do so as an independent.” He glanced\nat Shae and then at the Pillar. “I know it would be more difficult to win without the backing of one of"

I wouldn’t feel comfortable accepting the clan’s support and creating the\nappearance that my relationship with Shae is motivated by personal political gain.” He placed a hand\non Shae’s arm but continued speaking to Hilo. “The biggest reason, though, is that I think it’s\nimportant there be more voices in government that aren’t clan affiliated.”\nHilo’s eyebrows rose, very slightly. Shae’s eyes jumped between her brother and her boyfriend.\nThe contrast between Hilo and Maro was stark. Hilo sat relaxed in his chair, one elbow resting on the\ntable, taking up space in his usual casual manner. Maro sat upright and intent, seemingly older,\nwarier, more deliberate in posture and speech. “Independents can be bought or cowed,” Hilo said, in a\nperfectly neutral voice. “Does having them in the Royal Council really make any difference?”\n“If there were enough of them, it would,” Maro insisted. “There are things the clans accept as\nsacrosanct, that perhaps ought to be more closely examined for how well they actually serve society.\nSN1 prohibition, clean-bladed dueling, the Kekon Jade Alliance.”\nWen made an attempt to derail the impending collision by saying, brightly, “Hilo often\ncomplains about all the reading he has to do for the KJA meetings, and how slow and boring they\nare.”\n“They’re also economically inefficient,” Maro went on, failing to take the conversational escape\nWen offered him. “There’s a case to be made that jade ought to be treated like any other resource,\nwith supply and demand dictated by the open market.”\nHilo snorted. “Then the foreigners would try to buy up every pebble.”\n“Is that objectively such a bad thing?” Maro asked, as if prodding a student’s thesis argument.\n“The KJA constricts the global supply of jade, which artificially inflates prices and funnels capital\ninto the illegal secondary market instead of adding to our own GDP. With the availability of SN1,\nwe’re moving rapidly toward a time when jade is less and less exclusive to Kekonese.” When Maro\nwarmed to a subject, he spoke faster, his voice taking on a tone of academic discourse. “Our economy\nis developing and diversifying; we have other industries and resources. Our fastest-growing exports\nare manufactured goods, textiles, and metals. So why do we continue to treat jade as far more\nimportant than the others, something that has to be regulated by a national cartel and defended with\nviolence? Only because of our deep-seated historical and religious biases.”\nHilo looked at him in a funny way. Unlike Shae, he was not used to Maro’s habit of challenging\naccepted beliefs for the sake of robust debate. For a moment, Shae could sense her brother assessing\nMaro coldly: What kind of a Green Bone, what kind of Kekonese man, would devalue jade and all\nthat it represented, in front of the Pillar of the clan, no less?\n“Maro’s good at playing devil’s advocate,” Shae said quickly but firmly, putting a hand on"

He could argue you into believing a black cat was white, or a white\ncat black.”\nHilo gave them a thin smile. “That doesn’t change the color of the cat, though.”\nThe confidence in Maro’s manner faltered. Shae glimpsed embarrassed resentment color his\nface. She had forgotten how quickly Hilo could put other men in their place—with a glance or a\nword, and without even trying—and she was furious at her brother in that instant. Scholars might be\nrespected, but Kekonese parents prayed to have at least one son bring honor to the family as a Green\nBone warrior. All of Maro’s degrees were mere paper next to the jade of a man like Kaul Hilo, and for\na fleeting moment, Shae could see the reminder of that fact stamped across his stiff expression.\nMaro forced a smile. “I do argue too much, even outside the classroom. Shae is patient with me,\nbut sometimes I have to remember that not everyone appreciates it.”\nPerceiving either the man’s discomfort or Shae’s anger, Hilo’s manner changed immediately; he\nwaved off Maro’s explanation and said with a short laugh, “Shae, patient? I’ve never seen it. You\nmust bring out a better side of her.” He sat forward and clapped Maro on the shoulder in a\nlighthearted way. “Don’t take anything I said as a criticism; I’ve never had patience for politics\nmyself, but I’m sure you would succeed in it no matter what, and I’m glad my sister’s found someone\nwho’s a match for her in brains and strong opinions.”\nWen asked, “Do the two of you have any plans for Boat Day this year? We’re going to take our\nboys to the harborfront for the ship sinking. We haven’t been to see it in years.”\nThe momentary tension dissipated, and conversation veered back into lighter territory as they\nfinished their meals and lingered to enjoy tea. Maro gracefully took leave of their company before the\nhour grew too late. He saluted Hilo again, less formally this time, and thanked him for spending time\nwith them this evening. At the door, he turned to Shae with a relieved and rueful expression, as if to\nsay, Well, that wasn’t so bad—we survived, didn’t we? then gave her a kiss on the mouth. “Will I see\nyou sometime soon?” he asked in a lowered voice.\n“Soon,” she promised him.\nWen said she needed to return to the main house to nurse Ru and put him to bed but told her\nhusband he didn’t need to hurry. “Let’s have tea together next week, if you have the time, sister,” she\nsaid, embracing Shae on the way out. “Fourthday or Fifthday would be best; I have a class on\nSecondday and I’m going to the bathhouse on Thirdday. It’s been weeks since my last massage.”\n“We could build you a pool or a sauna here at home,” Hilo suggested. “It would save you all\nthese trips.”"

When Shae followed and stood next to him, he said, “That was\na nice dinner, Shae.” She was about to thank her brother when he added, “He’s a little odd, but I like\nhim well enough. At least he’s Kekonese.”\nShae’s reply took a sharp turn into indignation. “What did I say to you beforehand? I didn’t\ninvite Maro over to get your approval.”\nHilo turned to her with a frown. “Don’t yell at me, Shae. You invited me to come over to meet\nyour boyfriend, and I was happy to do that. You wanted me to take it easy on him, to not treat it like a\nbig deal, so that’s what I did. I already said it was a nice dinner; Wen and I had a nice time. You\nintroduce me to someone and then expect me not to say a single word?”\nEven though Hilo was unaware of Maro’s true parentage, Shae was incensed on her boyfriend’s\nbehalf. “‘At least he’s Kekonese?’ What does that mean?”\n“Exactly what I said, is all,” Hilo snapped. He ground out his cigarette with more force than\nnecessary. “Maybe that wasn’t the right way to put it,” he admitted grudgingly. “All I’m saying is that\nI’m glad we won’t have another issue like we did in the past. Maro’s too idealistic, but he seems like\na man with a good heart. He’s not anywhere near as green as you are, but there aren’t that many men\nwho are, so that’s no surprise. As long as he makes you happy, that’s what’s important. Do you love\nhim?”\nShae was thrown by the sudden question. The contrast between Hilo’s bluntness and apparent\nreasonableness made her unsure. “I think so,” she answered, almost without thinking.\nHilo said, “If you’re not sure you’re in love, then you’re not.”\nOf course that would be something Hilo would say. Shae knew for certain that she loved the time\nshe spent in Maro’s company, their long conversations, the warmth of him next to her in bed, the way\nhe was everything that No Peak so often was not: peaceable, thoughtful, open-minded. When she was\nwith him, she felt valued and attractive. She could imagine a future unfolding before them. But she\nhad been cautious ever since Jerald.\n“I think we’re getting there,” Shae said. “I wish we could spend more time together. The clan\ndoesn’t leave room for much else.”\nHer brother’s posture slackened. “I know,” he said, and rubbed a tired hand over his eyes."

Hilo\nwas the most hands-on Pillar anyone had ever known. He still left most of the business and political\nmatters to her, but she’d seen him sitting at the kitchen table in the evenings, forcing his way through\nindustry reports and highlighting the parts he needed to ask her about. He dutifully attended the\nmeetings she arranged with corporate executives and councilmen, compensating for lack of business\nexperience and knowledge with the undeniable force of his personal presence. Although he’d\ngradually given Kehn a great deal more autonomy, he still went out into the streets and talked with his\nFists and Fingers, met with Lantern Men, and reviewed every aspect of No Peak’s military activities,\nwhich had shifted and grown to include patrols in motorized boats and stakeouts in the mountainous\nwilderness.\nAyt Mada could command respect as a leader with her public poise and canny rhetoric. Hilo\ncould not do that, but he managed the vast No Peak clan in the same way he’d built his following as\nHorn: through thousands of conversations and personal interactions with his people, painstakingly\naccomplished one at a time. It was an effective but grueling way to be the Pillar. And now he also had\ntwo small children to take up all the rest of his energy.\n“I’ve no problem with Maro,” Hilo said, “but I don’t want any secrets or surprises. If it gets\nserious, if you want to marry him and bring him into the family, you have to tell me. You have to ask\nme properly.”\n“Because you’re my older brother?” Shae said, smirking a little.\n“Yes,” he said, with a touch of anger and a glare that said she was being difficult. “I’m the\nPillar,” Hilo said. “You don’t do something that affects the whole clan without the Pillar’s say so. I\nwent to Lan to ask for his permission before I married Wen.”\n“And what if he’d said no?”\n“He didn’t. Why would he do that?” Hilo’s aura was crackling with irritation now. “Just because\nyou’re my sister and the Weather Man, you think the rules don’t apply to you? Kehn came to me\nproperly. So did Woon. Of course I said yes to both of them.”\nShae blinked. “Woon… asked you if he could…?”\nHilo blinked back at her. “You didn’t know?” He gave her an odd, almost pitying look. “Shortly\nafter New Year’s. He came to see me and brought his girlfriend. They hadn’t been together long,\nmaybe four or five months. But the families know each other, and they seem happy together. As\nhappy as Woon ever seems, that is. It’s hard to tell with him.”\nNew Year’s had been eight weeks ago. Shae had been talking to Woon in her office that\nafternoon. “Why didn’t he tell me?” she asked, more to herself than to Hilo.\n“He was probably planning to and forgot,” Hilo said, though Shae could tell he didn’t believe\nthat was the reason. Woon did not forget anything."

Woon did not forget anything.\n“We’re Kauls; all our decisions are clan decisions, even the ones that seem private,” Hilo said.\n“You think I didn’t know that people would talk about the Maiks, about Wen being a stone-eye? Of\ncourse I knew. I gave Kehn and Tar every chance I could to earn green and prove their worth to the\nclan. I got Lan’s blessing to marry Wen. You’ve got to do the same with Maro, because he’s not going\nto be a force in No Peak. He’s a nice person, but the clan’s not for him. I’m sure he’ll go far in his\nown world, and he’ll have a good life if he’s with you, but he won’t be at the table after dinner when\nwe talk clan business. Ever. He has to know that going in, I’ll have to have that talk with him if and\nwhen you come to me. I think he already knows it about himself, so I don’t think it will be a problem.\nBut we’re getting ahead of ourselves; tonight was just a dinner, like you said, so let’s end the subject\nfor now.”\n“Let’s do that.” Shae heard her words come out sour and a little numb. She wanted, more out of\ninstinctual habit than anything else, to be angry at Hilo, but nothing he’d said was untrue.\nHilo yawned. “I should go. Ru’s going to wake me up before dawn.” He gazed out across the\ngarden. “How’s Andy?”\nThe question came so completely out of the blue that Shae had no response at first. Their cousin\nhad been in Espenia for more than a year, and Hilo had not once asked about him. Whenever Shae\nmentioned she’d spoken to Anden on the phone, or gotten a letter from him, Hilo listened but never\nreplied. His question now was delivered as simply and unexpectedly as a coma patient opening his\neyes and asking what time it was.\n“He’s doing well, I think,” Shae said. She tried to recall the most recent long-distance\nconversation she’d had with Anden, perhaps a month ago. “He says he’s getting good grades and the\nfamily he’s staying with treats him well. He’s made friends and is even playing relayball. He tells me\nthere are people wearing jade in Port Massy, if you can believe it. Among the Kekonese immigrants,\nthere’s a small, informal clan of sorts, and Anden’s gotten to know the local Pillar and his family.”\nShae shook her head incredulously. “I can’t believe he traveled thousands of kilometers from Kekon\nto find himself among Green Bones again.”\n“I’m not surprised.” Hilo spoke quietly. “Green isn’t easily rubbed away.”\nThe following morning, Shae arrived in her office on Ship Street to find Woon waiting for her,\nlooking unusually agitated. She felt a flash of worry—perhaps things were not all right between them\nafter all, perhaps that was why he hadn’t told her about his engagement, and he had somehow learned\nthat Hilo had informed her last night—but then her aide handed her a copy of the Janloon Daily"

Shae’s eyes fell on the headline:\nWeather Man of No Peak Was an Espenian Spy.\nShae stared uncomprehendingly for a moment, then read the rest of the article in mounting\ndisbelief. It cited confidential sources and documents proving that seven years ago Kaul Shaelinsan\nhad been in the employ of the Espenian military as a civilian informant. Over a period spanning\neighteen months, she had cooperated with the Espenian intelligence services to advance foreign\neconomic and political interests in Kekon. In return, she’d been handsomely paid and granted a\nstudent visa to attend graduate school in Windton with her boyfriend, an Espenian military officer of\nShotarian ancestry. A number of anonymous clan insiders testified that this betrayal on the part of his\nfavorite grandchild had rendered the late Kaul Seningtun heartbroken and caused a rift in the Kaul\nfamily that preceded the Torch’s physical and mental decline.\nThe newspaper began to shake in Shae’s hands. She threw it onto the desk and wrapped her\nfingers around the edge of the table. “This is Ayt Mada’s doing,” she whispered. Only yesterday she’d\nbeen smug about using the Espenians to deal a blow against the Mountain’s operations. She’d\nwondered when and how Ayt would respond, and now she had her answer.\nAt the height of the clan war, Ayt had dug into Shae’s background, had used her own spies and\nsources to discover everything she could about Shae’s past in an effort to sway her into turning\nagainst Hilo. Now she’d fed that information to the press. Shae’s decisions as Weather Man had\nalready garnered detractors, and the Oortokon War, which had been going on for eight months with\nmany casualties and little discernible progress, had fanned public hostility against foreigners and\nEspenia to a high point.

If she ignored the public\nrevelations, her silence would condemn her. If she denied them, Ayt would pounce on her lies. Her\nmind was racing, considering how to contain the damage, how to regain the upper hand she’d held\nonly yesterday afternoon, but beneath the calculation, a trembling fury was growing. She’d expected\nAyt to strike in some way, but she’d failed to anticipate that the blow would be so swift and personal,\nthat her own past would be used as a weapon against the clan.\n“We have to issue a statement as soon as possible,” Shae said. “Find out who these reporters are\nand what their ties are to the Mountain. Call the editor in chief of the Janloon Daily and tell him I\nwant to talk to him immediately. We need to shut this down.”\nCHAPTER\n27\nPurely Practical\nH\nilo opened the drawstring on the small black cloth bag that Kehn dropped on his desk and lifted\nout a handful of small jade buttons.

        "text": "H\nilo opened the drawstring on the small black cloth bag that Kehn dropped on his desk and lifted\nout a handful of small jade buttons. He rolled the gems in his palm and looked up questioningly at his\nHorn. Kehn said, “I had six Fingers and a dozen volunteer senior students from the Academy working\nfor days, going through boxes of clothes from the latest cargo ship we seized—the third one in as\nmany months. You’d think we’d opened a fucking sweatshop. Only, taking the clothes apart instead of\nputting them together.” Kehn looked as if he’d come straight from the Docks; his hair was windblown\nand the collar of his shirt was sweaty from the heat. He unslung his moon blade and propped it up\nagainst one of the chairs but didn’t sit down. “That’s just one of the bags; I had Juen bring the rest of\nthe jade to the Weather Man’s office for safekeeping.”\nHilo dropped the buttons back into the bag. “That Ygutanian shipping insurance company is still\nphoning every day, no matter how many times I tell them to go fuck themselves.”\n“Shae-jen is handling it. Starting with suing their clients for transporting stolen national assets.”\nKehn shrugged his large shoulders. “She has a lot to deal with right now, though.”\n“I heard you dropped a barukan man overboard and sunk his jade to the bottom of the ocean\nwithout thinking,” Hilo said, and grinned when Kehn looked a little embarrassed.\n“It was probably only a piece or two anyway,” Kehn grumbled, but Hilo stood up, pulled out half\na dozen of the jade buttons from the small sack, and went around the desk to lift the flap of Kehn’s\njacket and drop the gems into the Horn’s inside pocket.\n“That should cover your loss,” he said, straightening the jacket back into place. His brother-in-\nlaw muttered a protest, but Hilo said, “Don’t question me as Pillar; you deserve it. Besides, you’ll be\na married man soon; think of it as an early wedding gift.” It was encouraging to see Kehn come into\nhis own as Horn. Secretly, Hilo wished he could’ve led the raids himself, but he knew that was\nunreasonable, and he was glad this was Kehn’s victory alone. He was also pleased to see Kehn and\nShae working together in a way that the Horn and Weather Man usually did not. That was the way it\nought to be, the military and business sides of the clan cooperating instead of opposing each other,\nunlike how it had been with him and Doru.\nThere was a knock on the door and Tar put his head through to say, “There are people here to see\nyou, Hilo-jen.” Niko toddled past Tar’s legs and into the study. He had the run of the house and was\nalways getting underfoot. The boy put his arms out to be picked up. Hilo scooped him up and swung\nhim back and forth a few times, making him giggle, before handing him to Kehn and saying, “Go\nwith your uncle Kehn; I’ll play with you later.”\nHolding the squirming child in one arm, Kehn saluted one handed and began to withdraw."

        "text": "with your uncle Kehn; I’ll play with you later.”\nHolding the squirming child in one arm, Kehn saluted one handed and began to withdraw.\nBefore he left, Hilo said, “What about the Mountain? Are they keeping up their end of the bargain?”\nKehn paused at the door and grunted an affirmative. “So far, it would seem so. Nau Suen and his\nGreen Bones have caught half a dozen scavenging crews so far this year.” At Hilo’s wary silence, he\nadded, “Don’t worry, Hilo-jen, we’re keeping an eye on them.”\nAfter Kehn left with Niko, a man and a woman entered. Hilo had never met them before, but\nhe’d heard of their terrible misfortune and knew who they were. Mr. Eyun was the co-owner of a\nlocal packaging firm and a minor Lantern Man in the clan; he and his wife had five children. The\neldest, a girl, was sixteen years old. The couple saluted Hilo in silence and sat themselves down\nwoodenly on the sofa across from him. Hilo motioned for Tar to remain in the room, then closed the\ndoor before sitting down across from the Eyuns and inquiring gently, “How’s your daughter?”\n“She’ll live,” Mr. Eyun said hoarsely. His wife’s face trembled with the effort of holding back\nher emotions. Both of them appeared to be in a state of shock.\nHilo motioned for Tar to offer the visitors some water. “Is there anything the clan can do to help\nyour family right now?” Hilo asked. “You don’t have to worry about medical expenses; that’s already\ntaken care of. Is there anything else you need?”\n“Vengeance,” Mr. Eyun whispered fiercely, his voice breaking. “The Espenian dogs who did this\ndeserve worse than death.”\nHilo had nothing but sympathy for the poor Eyun family, but he knew this would be a difficult\nconversation in which he could not promise everything that he would want to. “The two soldiers have\nbeen taken into custody by their own government and are being held in the base on Euman Island.\nThey can’t be touched right now.”\nMrs. Eyun began to cry, and Mr. Eyun burst out angrily, “The lawyers say that the Espenians\nhave negotiated for the soldiers to be tried in civil court and to serve their sentence in their home\ncountry. They offer us money as compensation. For beating and raping my daughter—money!” Mrs.\nEyun clutched her husband’s arm and wept harder, but Mr. Eyun, flushed and maddened, seemed not\nto notice her as his voice climbed. “The Royal Council can’t stand up to the Espenians, but I thought I\ncould count on the clan to deliver justice. You were the Horn and now you’re the Pillar. You’re\nsupposed to be the fearsome Kaul Hiloshudon of No Peak. Are you saying that even you’re toothless\nagainst these foreigners, these animals?”\nHilo gave Mr. Eyun a minute to regain control of himself, then he said, calmly but a little coldly,\n“Because of your grief, I’m not offended by anything you say. If these two men were Kekonese,\nthey’d already be in far worse shape than your poor daughter. Unfortunately that’s not the case, and"

Unfortunately that’s not the case, and\nwith all that’s happening in the world these days and all the foreign powers our country has to deal\nwith, there are limits to even what the clan can do.”\nHilo placed a box of tissues in front of Mrs. Eyun. “I said those men can’t be touched right now.\nSometimes we have to wait for justice, but the clan doesn’t forget offenses. Let’s see what happens. I\ncan’t make you any promises, but I’m a parent myself so you should know that I consider the crime\nagainst your family to be unforgivable.”\nMr. Eyun’s mouth trembled and he lowered his face; Mrs. Eyun wiped her eyes with a handful of\ntissues. Hilo said, “My advice is to take the money that the Espenians offer; take as much as you can\nget from them. It may feel like dirty money that’s being used to bribe you out of what you really\ndeserve, but don’t think of it that way. Let them feel as if they’ve made amends—that’s how their\npeople do it—and use the money to take care of your daughter and the rest of your family.”\nHilo’s tone was kind as he said this, but also firm. Tar showed the heartbroken parents out the\ndoor, and the Pillar asked for a couple of minutes to be by himself. He felt bad about not being able to\ngive the Eyuns greater assurances, but the Oortokon War and the large ROE military presence on\nKekon was like a weeping sore on the bottom of one’s foot; it seemed like no one on Kekon, not even\nthe Green Bone clans, could take a single step without feeling it and wincing at the trouble and pain it\nadded to even the simplest tasks. Just last week, following a conversation with Eiten in the Double\nDouble, Hilo had sent Kehn to shut down a dozen illegal money-changers taking advantage of the\nforeign servicemen frequenting the casinos on Poor Man’s Road, as well as to bolster security in the\nArmpit following a string of drunken incidents.\n“Do you want me to send in Hami and the others, Hilo-jen?” Tar asked. Hilo grimaced and was\ngreatly tempted to say no, but if he did, the problem waiting outside his door would not go away and\nwould only get worse, which it seemed likely to anyway. “Fine,” he said.\nTar admitted four men into the study. One of them was Hami Tumashon, the Master Luckbringer\nof the clan. Hilo recognized another as Councilman Kowi by his turnip-shaped head. The other two\nwere senior Lantern Men whose names Hilo did not remember offhand. They saluted Hilo\nrespectfully; Mr. Kowi said, “Kaul-jen, may the gods continue to shine favor on No Peak. We know\nyou’re very busy, especially with two small sons at home, so we appreciate you taking the time to\nmeet with us to hear our concerns.”\n“You’re right, it’s been very busy; you all have children, so maybe you remember how it is.\nThank you for coming to my home instead of forcing me to make the trip to Wisdom Hall or"

        "text": "“You’re right, it’s been very busy; you all have children, so maybe you remember how it is.\nThank you for coming to my home instead of forcing me to make the trip to Wisdom Hall or\nsomewhere else.” A reminder to everyone in the room that he had not even wanted to take this\nmeeting and had acquiesced only on account of Hami, whom he liked and respected. Hilo sat down in\none of the armchairs and his guests seated themselves as well. Without any further preamble, Hilo\nsaid, “So what is it that you’re here to ask me?” He already knew the answer, but he wanted them to\nhave to speak their minds out loud, to justify themselves to the Pillar.\nThe men glanced at each other before Councilman Kowi said, “Kaul-jen, it’s about your sister.\nGiven the scandalous revelations of her past… She shouldn’t continue as Weather Man.”\n“Why’s that?” Hilo asked.\nThe councilman looked uncomfortable but said, “I want to say first of all that I have absolutely\nnothing against the Weather Man personally; I’m only concerned for the reputation of No Peak. I’m\nafraid it looks extremely bad for the clan, Kaul-jen. The main thing is that she was an agent for the\nEspenian military and sold them information that might’ve been of national security importance. And\ntoday, the Janloon Daily printed an interview with her former lover, an Espenian soldier of Shotarian\nblood. She was still involved with him while living in Espenia, less than four years ago.” Mr. Kowi\nspread his hands, indicating how self-evident the problem was. “How can she be trusted in the\nsecond-highest position of No Peak?”\nHilo saw the two Lantern Men nodding along, and he shifted his eyes to Hami. “You’re sitting in\nthis room as Master Luckbringer, Hami-jen, and have many years of experience on the business side\nof the clan. In your opinion, is the Weather Man running Ship Street badly?”\nHami glanced at the other men before shifting in his seat and clearing his throat. “No, I wouldn’t\nsay that. She’s made some… debatable decisions, but that’s not the same thing.”\n“But you asked for this meeting and you’re sitting here. So you agree with them.”\n“I share their concerns about the way this affects No Peak’s standing,” Hami said. “Councilman\nKowi has always advanced the clan’s interests in Wisdom Hall, and Mr. Orn and Mr. Eho are two of\nthe clan’s highest Lantern Men. When they came to me to request an audience with you, I thought it\nwas important that you hear from them directly. I’m not advocating for any specific decision on your\npart as Pillar.” Hami might be known for his straightforward honesty, but he was certainly savvy\nenough not to presume above his rank, nor to speak poorly of his own Weather Man in front of people\nwho were not Green Bones.\nHilo said to the two Lantern Men, “You think I should replace the Weather Man?”\n“Kaul-jen,” said the older of the two men, whom Hilo recognized now as Mr. Eho, “this is a\npurely practical decision.

Along with the Pillar and the Horn, the Weather Man is the face of the clan.\nSince this information about her past has emerged, the press and the public have been questioning if\nshe’s still secretly working for the foreigners, serving their interests instead of ours. They’ve been\ncalling her Espenia’s charm girl. Very crude. The thing is, the Oortokon War has turned opinion\nagainst Adamont Capita. The Weather Man’s past is a problem for No Peak.”\n“She could resign and continue to assist the Weather Man’s office in a less visible role,” added\nMr. Orn, whom Hilo also recalled had recently declared an intention to run for the Royal Council\nhimself. “We simply need someone more publicly suitable to be a business leader.”\nHilo ignored him and said to Mr. Eho, “Who’s calling her that?” When the Lantern Man blinked\nin confusion, Hilo repeated himself. “Who’s been calling my little sister a whore?”\n“I… I never said…” Mr. Eho stammered, looking suddenly contrite, even a little bit frightened,\nas if he was just now remembering that Kaul Hilo had a prior reputation of his own.\n“Don’t bother to answer,” Hilo said. “I know who. Ayt Mada’s set up the whole thing to make\nherself out as a patriot. She’s smearing Shae in order to weaken No Peak.”\n“Still, you can’t deny the facts,” Councilman Kowi argued.\n“No,” Hilo said, “I don’t deny them. My sister made some mistakes when she was young, but\neveryone does. She had a foolish romance with a foreigner, but that’s over, and any communication\nshe has with the Espenians these days are for No Peak’s gain, on account of the oaths she took to me\nas Pillar. If she’s doing her job as Weather Man, there’s no problem.”\n“Kaul-jen,” Mr. Eho exclaimed, “don’t you care how this looks, what people think?”\nHilo gave Eho, Orn, and Kowi a briefly withering glance, then laid a hard, flat stare on Hami, as\nif to say that naturally the others could be forgiven for wasting his time, but he’d expected a Green\nBone to know better. The Pillar was the spine of the clan; he didn’t make decisions to please others.\nCertainly not jadeless politicians.\nHami’s aura drew in, and he said, with some defensiveness, “It would be irresponsible for me as\nMaster Luckbringer not to point out the consequences this might have on No Peak, and on your own\nleadership, Kaul-jen. Your grandfather and most of his comrades are gone—let the gods recognize\nthem. When people look at Green Bones today, they’re not looking at the heroes from the Many\nNations War. They’re seeing young leaders who grew up with wealth and foreign influences and\nwondering whether they’re green enough to defend the country the way their parents and\ngrandparents did.”\nHilo leaned forward and swept an unimpressed stare around the circle of men. “My grandfather\nkept his old crony Yun Dorupon in place as Weather Man for decades, long after he should’ve retired\nand no matter how many pubescent girls he fucked, and I didn’t see you putting up much of a stink"

Reluctantly, his visitors stood as well. Councilman Kowi and the two Lantern Men were visibly\ndissatisfied, saying nothing as they saluted stiffly.\nHilo said, “I like that you speak your mind, Hami-jen, as long as you keep using your good sense\nto serve the Weather Man.” The Master Luckbringer dipped into a wordless, terse salute and left\nalong with the others. When they were gone, Hilo paced several circles around the study, cursing\nunder his breath. Then he picked up the phone on the desk and dialed the Weather Man’s office,\nreaching Shae’s secretary. “Tell my sister we need to talk.”\nCHAPTER\n28\nNot That Stupid\nB\nero’s prospects, which had seemed so promising last year, had been stalled for months, ever since\nthe Mountain raided the scavenging operation and murdered the Uwiwan work crew. It had taken him\nand Mudt the rest of that miserable night and another two whole days to walk down the mountain and\nhitchhike back to Janloon. When they finally arrived, hungry, sore, and bedraggled, and told Soradiyo\nthat Green Bones had killed the pickers, stolen the trucks, and taken the jade, the barukan manager’s\nface had turned purple, and he looked fit to kill both of them on the spot.\n“All the fucking jade you’re wearing, and you couldn’t Perceive them in time to get out of there\nwith anything?”\n“We got out with our lives,” Mudt muttered.\n“Yes, how are you alive?” Soradiyo asked, his eyes narrowing with suspicion. “Why didn’t Nau\nsnap your necks?”\n“He sent us back to give you a message,” Bero said. “Says he wants to talk. Says you’re not\ngoing to make money at this rate. I think he wants to buy you out.”\nSoradiyo’s narrow face seemed to lengthen further with his scowl. “Get the fuck out of my\nsight,” he told them.\nBero thought their next job would be an opportunity to make up for the prior disaster, but it\nturned out to not even be a scavenge; they were trucked out to a windy cove on the remote west side\nof the island to help pack motorized fishing boats with raw jade stones hidden under ice and seafood.\nApparently, the clans were unofficially running the coast guard and patrolling Kekon’s waters so\nvigorously that it was becoming increasingly difficult to sneak jade offshore. Soradiyo was splitting\nup his shipments to the Uwiwa Islands and sending half a dozen boats in different directions at the\nsame time, hoping that at least a few would get through.

The one\ntime Bero found him in the Rat House and demanded an explanation, he said testily, “Soon, soon, all\nright? I’ve got other things going on, things that might solve a lot of our problems,” but refused to\nfurther elaborate. Bero became frustrated and impatient.\nMudt’s attitude did not help. “I told you from the start, keke, we don’t need that unreliable\nbarukan asshole. It was a bad idea to begin with, but fine, we did it, we’re still alive and we made\nenough money to last awhile. The clans are hitting the smuggling harder and harder, and Soradiyo’s\ngoing to end up as worm food, so it’s better we get out now while we can. Get back to training\nseriously, and then to going after Maik.”\n“I don’t give a fuck about the Maiks,” Bero snapped.\nMudt yelled at him, “Maik Tar killed my da.”\n“Your da had it coming,” Bero said, “messing in a clan war, and you’ll end up the same way if\nyou don’t shut up.”\nThe next day, however, Bero felt a little bad for having spoken so harshly to Mudt. They had\nbeen through quite a few harrowing times together, he and Mudt. They had stolen jade and risked\ndeath together. They were each alone, and so they were friends, of a sort. He was surprised to realize\nthat he did not want to lose the kid, that deep down, he kind of liked him. So he called Mudt up, and\nthey went to play pool in the basement of the Rat House. Bero said, “I didn’t mean what I said about\nyour da. We’ll get Maik. I’ll help you get that fucker back for what he did. And then we’ll take his\njade for ourselves, the same way we took Kaul’s. You and me.”\nMudt looked up with eagerness in his small black eyes and was a lot more cheerful after that.\nThey hung out and trained, and Bero went back to dealing shine, but still he hoped that Soradiyo\nwould call with some other work, or a new opportunity would materialize, because despite what he’d\nsaid to Mudt to make the kid feel better, Bero had no intention of going after the Maiks for the sake of\nsome foolish sense of revenge that wasn’t important to him.\nWhen Soradiyo finally called them up to meet in the Rat House, he clapped Bero and Mudt on\nthe backs and spoke to them in a perfectly friendly way, as if there had never been any problems\nbetween them. When they’d all had a few drinks and gone through the usual conversational bullshit,\nBero said, “We’ve been working as rockfish for more than a year. Where’s the jade you promised\nwe’d be earning by now?”"

Where’s the jade you promised\nwe’d be earning by now?”\nSoradiyo spread his hands. “You’re getting it soon, keke.” He seemed to have picked up some\nKekonese slang and mannerisms since Bero had first met him. “But the rainy season doesn’t count.\nThat’s vacation time. You’ve got another couple months to go.”\nBero scowled. “So you’ve got more work for us, then?”\nFor the first time that Bero could remember, Soradiyo appeared nervous. He wetted his lips and\nleaned in to speak so that no one could overhear them. “Yeah, but it’s not a scavenge,” he said.\n“What is it, then?” said Bero. “Packing rock, again?”\n“It’s what you call a whispered name. Can’t wear jade to do it either, because it’s not just any\nname. We’ve been offered the chance to go on the offensive. To go into the tiger’s lair, so to speak. I\nneed a couple of kekes who’re fearless and want to make a shitload of money.”\n“Who are we going after?” Mudt leaned in, sounding interested for the first time.\n“First, I have to be sure you’re both up to the task. We’ve got a plan to get you in, do the job and\nget out, no problem. Still, it’s going to be—”\n“Not interested,” said Bero.\nSoradiyo sat back, surprised by his quick refusal. “It’s a big opportunity. If you don’t take it, I’ll\ngive it to Mo and Shrimps.” They were another pair of his rockfish managers.\nBero shrugged. He didn’t care to explain that he’d already been down this road. Every time he’d\nhad a run-in with Green Bones, he’d been lucky to escape the encounter alive, and far from gaining\nwhat was promised, his fortunes had taken a nosedive. He’d had enough near-death experiences for\nsomeone who was only twenty years old, and he’d learned by now that there were easier ways to get\njade than trying to kill a Green Bone directly. He finally knew what it was like to wear jade and walk\naround with a secret sense of power over all the weaker people around him—but the Green Bones\ncould take it all away from him in an instant, leave his body floating in Summer Harbor.\n“Give me another scavenge job. I’ll even pack fish like last time, but I’m not taking off my jade\nfor anything, and I’m not doing any whisper work, not if it involves Green Bones,” Bero said. “I’m\nnot that stupid.”\nSoradiyo got out of his chair. “Wait, what about me?” protested Mudt, but the barukan threw\ndown some money for the drinks, gave both of them a scornful, disappointed glance, and walked out\nof the Rat House.\nCHAPTER\n29\nOpening and Closing Doors\nT\nhe Lantern Man Mr. Enke was back in Shae’s office.

And this particular development is good value for\nits location.”\n“And you want the clan to loan you the capital,” Shae concluded.\nMr. Enke extracted a file folder from his briefcase, placed it on the table, and opened it to a page\nwith a financial summary detailing his request. “With the assistance of the Weather Man’s office,\nEnke Property Group could purchase a forty percent stake in the development.”\nMoneylending was one of the most common activities on the business side of the clan. Of\ncourse, Mr. Enke could go to an independent bank to ask for a loan, but banks were purely financial\ninstitutions, operating within a limited scope. A relationship with the clan meant that Mr. Enke had\naccess to innumerable business connections throughout Kekon and beyond it, the assurance that\nGreen Bones would protect his properties from criminals and rivals, and preferential interest rates that\nreflected the fact that he had two Academy-trained sons who wore jade and served the clan as Fists.\nHe would resort to the open market if No Peak did not give him as much as he hoped for, but like\nmost Lantern Men of standing, he went first to the clan.\nShae studied the figures on the paper in front of her, then handed the file folder over her shoulder\nto Woon. She regarded Mr. Enke silently while her Shadow perused the papers. If Woon had any\nconcerns, he would give a subtle signal—a cough, a clearing of the throat—to indicate that she ought\nto hold off on her decision. She Perceived in the even hum of Woon’s aura that he was satisfied with\nwhat he saw. Mr. Enke, however, could not tell; faced with the intimidating silence of the Weather\nMan and the stoic expression of the aide behind her, he continued talking. “I’ve sent my most\nexperienced scouts to Port Massy, and they’ve all reported back that the area of Lochwood is\ndesirable. Well served by transit, rapidly gentrifying, walking distance to the Port Massy College\ncampus and major shopping districts. The development will be mixed use: condominium apartments\nwith ground level commercial space and—”\nWoon closed the file folder and handed it back to the Weather Man, who placed it on her desk\nand said, “Mr. Enke, the Weather Man’s office would be pleased to extend our patronage.”\nMr. Enke broke into a smile and touched his clasped hands to his forehead. “Kaul-jen, I couldn’t\nbe more pleased to have the clan’s approval. May the gods shine favor on No P—”\n“I’d like you to buy the entire development.”\nThe Lantern Man blinked. “That’s far more than…”\n“You’ll have to adjust your calculations,” she said. “The clan is willing to finance your\nacquisition of a controlling interest in the project. As you say, it’s a good investment.”\nMr. Enke cleared his throat. “I would like to take advantage of your generosity, Kaul-jen, but\nthere are regulations in Espenia strictly limiting foreign ownership of property.”\n“I’ve recently received reliable assurances from the Espenian ambassador that within three"

The Espenians were stingy, but reliable. “Move now to purchase the forty percent stake as you\nplanned, and buy out the rest next year.”\nMr. Enke opened and closed his mouth, then said, “My current tribute rates…”\n“Would normally go up, but there’s a way we can work around that,” Shae said. “It’s becoming\nmore common for Kekonese graduates to further their education by going to study in Espenia. It was\nunusual when I did it five years ago, but these days, many families encourage their children to gain\nsome international experience. My younger cousin is in Espenia right now, living with a host family.\nOnce these apartments are built, you can rent them out to Kekonese students studying in Port Massy.\nCharge them half the market rate for the area. In exchange, the clan will screen potential tenants from\nNo Peak families and cover the difference in your income. Our subsidy will offset your tribute\nobligations, and you’ll be guaranteed renters who’ve been backed by the clan.”\nMr. Enke licked his lips warily. His bushy eyebrows drew down until they touched. “Kaul-jen,”\nhe said slowly, “can I count on this being a binding agreement with the Weather Man’s office?”\nNormally, such a question would be unnecessary; the Weather Man’s word guaranteed\nfulfillment of the contract. But Mr. Enke was not sure Shae would remain in charge of Ship Street\nlong enough to deliver on their arrangement. Since the scandal over her past connection to the\nEspenian military intelligence services had broken six weeks ago, she had been persistently\ndisparaged in the media and there had been calls for her resignation.\nShae gave no sign that she shared Mr. Enke’s doubts. “Woon-jen will have a memo of our\nconversation drawn up in writing and sent to you by the end of the day,” she said.\nSatisfied, Mr. Enke promised that he would have an updated financial proposal to the Weather\nMan’s office by the following week. Woon showed the Lantern Man out the door, then took the\nvacated chair in front of Shae. “You’re hoping to turn this into a human resources advantage,” he\nsaid.\n“Opening doors, as you say,” Shae replied.\nWoon nodded slowly. “Offering incentives for families in the clan to send their children to\ncollege in Espenia could benefit No Peak in the long run, but only if they put their education to use\nfor the clan. What’s to stop the students we send there from being lured away by the bright lights of\nEspenia? We might lose much of our potential talent overseas.”\n“In addition to subsidized housing, we’ll pay their tuition. But only if they return to Kekon and\nwork for the Weather Man’s office for three years after graduation.” She expected very few, if any,\nsponsored students would be so foolish as to renege on a promise to the clan, not when they had\nfamilies in Janloon whose lives and livelihoods depended on No Peak’s continued favor."

At least he would assume that\nit was attributable to the verbal attacks mounting against her, including the fact that Ayt Madashi\nspared no opportunity to declare that as a patriotic Green Bone clan Pillar, she would never allow a\nformer Espenian spy near the leadership of the Mountain. With the Heroes Day holiday only two\nweeks away, Shae expected things to only get worse, not better.\nShe did not want Woon to suspect that there was anything else troubling her beyond that. “No,\nPapi-jen,” Shae said, doing her best to sound unconcerned, even a bit optimistically smug. “I told you\nAmbassador Mendoff would come through on his debt, didn’t I?”\nAfter Woon had departed, the phone on Shae’s desk rang and she nearly jumped. It wasn’t the\ncall she’d been expecting. Maro said, “I don’t mean to bother you at work, but I saw the newspaper\nthis morning and just wanted to call to see if you were doing all right.”\nShae felt a fist close in her chest at the sound of Maro’s voice. She glanced at the clock and\nclosed her eyes; she couldn’t talk to him right now. “I’m fine,” she told him. “This isn’t even close to\nthe worst thing Ayt Mada has done to my family.”\nIt was, however, proving to be effective. Shae had issued a public statement declaring that her\nconsultative work with the Espenian government had ended years ago and categorically denying any\nconflicts of interest that would compromise her loyalty to No Peak and to Kekon. She’d responded to\nthe attacks in greater length in an interview with Toh Kita on KNB. She’d criticized and pressured the\neditorial staff of the Janloon Daily. All to no avail; the Daily’s owner had, unsurprisingly, family and\nbusiness ties to the Mountain and, also, papers to sell. Jerald’s smiling face had stared up at Shae this\nmorning from the black-and-white newsprint. Some industrious reporter had tracked him down in the\ncity of Loruge, south of Adamont Capita, where he now worked as a mortgage broker, but they’d\npaired the tabloid-style interview with an old photograph of him dressed in his ROE Navy officer’s\nuniform.\n“All of this is such bullshit,” Maro burst out over the phone. “The things they’re saying about\nyou are completely unfair. It’s shortsighted, misogynistic, anti-foreigner hysteria. Don’t give in to\nwhat they want. You deserve your place as Weather Man no matter what they say.” She’d never heard"

You deserve your place as Weather Man no matter what they say.” She’d never heard\nhim so upset and angry. “Isn’t there anything I can do to help?”\n“There isn’t,” Shae said. “This is clan war again, in a different way. My brother and I will handle\nit. Just… stay clear of the whole mess and don’t talk to any reporters.” Ayt and the press did not know\nabout Maro or his family background, and she wished to keep it that way. She wanted to say more but\nsaid, “I have to go. I’ll call you back later.”\n“All right,” Maro said. “Stand your ground. I love you.”\nShae swallowed, glad that Perception did not work through telephone lines. “Me too.”\nThe phone in Shae’s office rang again twenty minutes later. This time, it was the call she’d been\nawaiting from the doctor’s clinic. The nurse on the other end of the line came to the point quickly.\n“The urine sample you dropped off yesterday tested positive.”\n“Are you sure?” Shae asked.\n“Yes,” said the nurse. “You’re pregnant. Would you like to make an appointment to see one of\nour obstetricians? We have available times as early as next week.”\n“Not right now.” Shae thanked the nurse and hung up. She sat in silence for what felt like a few\nminutes that might’ve in reality been much longer, because she had the strange and nauseating\nsensation of everything around her—the office noises, the energies of the people nearby, the very\nmovement of the air—coming to an ungraceful momentary standstill.\nShae picked up the phone again. She had a sudden impulse to call the clinic back to demand a\nretest because maybe there had been a mistake after all, but she knew that was mere denial. Instead\nshe dialed her secretary and told her to reschedule the rest of her appointments for the day, as she was\nnot feeling well. Shae got up, took the elevator to the ground floor, walked across the spacious lobby\nof the clan’s office tower, and out the front doors of the building.\nOutside, she began walking west. It was a hot but soggy day; people streamed in both directions\nalong the sidewalk, wearing summer clothes but carrying umbrellas. Shae walked for thirty minutes,\nuntil her feet ached in her black pumps and sweat plastered her blouse to the small of her back under\nher blazer. Rain fell, not steadily but with insulting indifference, scattered fat droplets that flecked the\nasphalt and landed noisily on awnings, car hoods, and garbage lids. Where Ship Street ended, Shae\nturned right and kept going, out of the Financial District, until she passed between the stone pillars\nand through the treed courtyard of the Temple of Divine Return.\nShae went straight to the front of the sanctum and knelt on one of the green prayer cushions.\nRainwater from her damp hair left speckles on the stone floor as she touched her head to the ground\nthree times and whispered, in a litany that she had repeated so many times that she barely had to call\nit to mind consciously, “Yatto, Father of All. Jenshu, Old Uncle. I beg you recognize my grandfather"

Above all, guide and protect those of us who\nremain in this world, especially Wen and Niko and Ru, and my brother Hilo, for whom I also beg\nyour forgiveness.” Shae fell quiet, trying to put her churning thoughts and emotions into words. From\nthe front of the room, the steady burning energy of the meditating penitents filled the white spaces in\nher mind.\nShe spoke aloud, almost in a demand. “What do I do now?”\nShe couldn’t believe she was pregnant—not intellectually, though she had no reason to doubt the\nclinic’s verdict. When her cycle was late, she’d assumed that the stress of dealing with the public\nscandal had something to do with it. She and Maro had taken precautions. She was an educated\nprofessional woman, she was the Weather Man. She would’ve placed an unplanned pregnancy well\nbelow sudden assassination in her internal ranking of things that she considered likely to happen to\nher. The timing, she mused despairingly, could not be worse.\nShae had never been able to say if she wanted children. She loved her two nephews dearly but\ndidn’t feel a maternal longing of her own. There was no room for the feeling; her position in the clan\nwas all-consuming, and she’d been beleaguered in her role from the start. Perhaps if things were\ndifferent, the urge to have children would happen naturally. But nothing in her life, it seemed,\nhappened naturally—only as unavoidable blows, like those of a sledgehammer.\nThere was no precedent for a woman with children in the leadership of a Green Bone clan. Ayt\nMada had no offspring of her own and continued to pointedly ignore those who questioned her about\nthe succession. After Lan’s death and the ouster of Doru, it had been difficult for No Peak to accept a\nyoung woman as Weather Man, but it had been a desperate time of clan war, and Shae was a Kaul.\nShe still wore the label of being the Torch’s favorite grandchild, she was backed by respected men\nlike Woon and Hami, and few people dared to challenge her brother.\nThose advantages would not help her now. She was already under attack for her past supposed\nmisdeeds; she couldn’t walk into a boardroom or into Wisdom Hall pregnant out of wedlock with the\nchild of a man from a family of little standing in the Green Bone community. Ayt and the press would\ndig into Maro’s past, would question his parentage and his many trips to Shotar, would flay open his\nfamily’s history and discover that he was the bastard of a Shotarian soldier. Maro was not a Kaul; he\nwas barely green. He was not equipped to handle the animosity and scrutiny, the risk to his\nprofessional career and to his safety. It would ruin his life."

It was true that the clan was a big, old ship, but for two and a half years, she’d\nthrown herself sweating against the wheel, straining No Peak toward the growth and change required\nto survive enemies at home and the threats of the modern world beyond. Her efforts were beginning\nto take effect: She’d gotten the clan back on solid financial footing, made advantageous military and\ntrade agreements with the Espenians, expanded the clan’s operations and opened up opportunities. If\nshe was ousted from her position by personal scandal, everything she had accomplished might be\nundone. Woon and Hami were capable, there was no doubt of that, but they had not lived abroad, they\nwere not as strategic as Ayt Mada, they would not know how to stand up to Hilo or persuade him.\nAnd it was worse than that: Shae’s brother had appointed her Weather Man and stubbornly kept her in\nthe role against all opposition; her shameful downfall would cascade through the clan, would become\nan indictment of the whole family and affect Hilo’s standing as Pillar.\nAll of these thoughts sank from Shae’s mind through her body and settled like a pile of rocks in\nthe pit of her stomach. She’d assumed business leadership of the clan because she’d been forced—by\nher own actions and her brother’s death—and when the days were long and the work difficult, she\ntold herself that she was doing it for Lan and for her grandfather. Deep down, she knew herself better\nthan that. She wanted to be the Weather Man.\nShae gazed up at the high ceiling of the sanctum and closed her eyes. She waited for an\nepiphany, for a sense of spiritual peace to fill her and guide her with certainty. She stretched out her\nPerception and tried to sense a message in the croon of jade energy that vibrated through her flesh and\nbones. She felt nothing from the gods, except perhaps a distant watchfulness, and within herself, only\na turbulence swirling and coalescing finally into resignation and purpose.\nShe got up and left the temple.\nCHAPTER\n30\nHeroes Day\nW\nen alone went with Shae to the clinic early on a Secondday morning. They took one of the\nfamily’s nondescript cars, leaving both Wen’s conspicuous Lumezza convertible and Shae’s red\nCabriola in the garage. Wen could always say that she was going to the doctor for a prenatal checkup\nand that Shae was the one accompanying her. At twelve weeks, Wen was clearly showing her second\npregnancy. She was still nursing Ru, so between her enlarged breasts and swelling belly, her body was\na collection of soft maternal curves. Shae felt as if they were doing something wrong, perhaps\ninviting bad luck, for Wen to be an accomplice to terminating an unborn life when she was carrying\none of her own. “You don’t have to come inside,” she told her sister-in-law. “You’re doing me enough\nof a favor driving me there and back. That’s all I’m asking for.”\n“If it were me, I’d like another woman to be with me,” Wen said. “Why should we have to go\nthrough hardships in life by ourselves?” She parked the car in the nearly empty lot. It was still dark;"

It was still dark;\nthe clinic didn’t open for another two minutes.\n“It seems unlucky for you to be here,” Shae said.\nWen cupped her hands around a thermos full of ginger tea, which she drank every morning to\nhelp settle her stomach. A wry smile curved her lips. “I’ve been called unlucky my whole life. I’m not\nafraid of bad luck any more than a bird would be afraid of feathers.”\nThey went inside and Shae checked in. Getting an abortion was neither particularly easy nor\nparticularly difficult in Janloon. Clinics varied in repute and there was a moderate cost, but the main\nrestriction was that a woman had to obtain the consent of her husband if she was married, or that of a\nmale relative if she was not. This rule was regularly circumvented for an additional fee. Shae had\nfilled out the necessary paperwork in advance and forged Hilo’s signature next to her own at the\nbottom. The young woman at the reception counter looked at the forms, then at Shae, and her eyes\nwidened. Shae suspected the receptionist did not see heavily jaded Green Bones come through the\nclinic very often.\nWen went with her into the room and then held her hand during the whole procedure, which took\nless time than Shae had expected. Afterward, as she rested in a pleasantly sedated state, Shae said,\n“You were right. I’m glad you’re here.” She almost added, “Please don’t tell anyone,” but caught\nherself before she said it, realizing how insulting and laughable it would sound. She already knew that\nher sister-in-law could be trusted with secrets.\nWen drove them home. Shae felt relieved, if somewhat damaged. She thought of Maro—his\nearnest expression, his thoughtfulness, his genuine optimism and belief in her—and a band of sadness\nand guilt cinched around her and made it momentarily hard to breathe. The two of them had not\ndiscussed having children, but the way Maro spoke so fondly of his nieces, she was certain he wanted\na family of his own eventually. She hadn’t called him or returned any of his several messages since\nthey had spoken on the phone in her office three days ago, before she’d known for certain what she\nhad to do. And what she still had to do. She was terrified that if she spoke to him, something in her\nvoice would give her away and he would know, or that hearing his concern or seeing him again would\nrob her of her conviction.\nShe leaned her head against the car door. “Do you think less of me now?” she asked.\nHer sister-in-law stopped the car so abruptly that Shae had to put a hand against the dash. Wen\npulled the car over to the curb and put the gear shift in park. She turned to face Shae, her eyes\nflashing. “Shae-jen, I’m ashamed to say this, but there was a time when I didn’t trust you very much\nbecause I wasn’t sure you were the sort of person who would put others ahead of yourself.” She fixed\nShae with a steady, almost unnerving stare. “You could’ve resigned your position to marry your"

It would create a miserable scandal for a while, but then you’d be free to\nlive a much easier life. But where would No Peak be without you as Weather Man? How could my\nhusband be Pillar without your counsel? What would become of the valuable work we’ve done\ntogether, and in the future how could I do anything in the clan at all without you?” Wen declared,\nalmost angrily, “I could never forgive you if you decided to be so selfish. So how can you believe I\nwould think any less of you for being responsible instead?”\nShae was a little taken aback. “But you have children.”\nWen put the car back into gear and began driving again. She finished the dregs of her tea and\nspoke matter-of-factly. “We each serve the clan in the way we’re best suited. Look at Ayt Mada and\nhow alone she is. We must never be like that.”\nBefore she’d left Kekon to pursue a degree at Belforte Business School in Windton, Espenia, Shae\nhad lived for three weeks in a room in the Tranquil Suites Hotel on Euman Island. Jerald had been\ndischarged two months ago and was awaiting her back in his home country, and after the most recent\nscreaming family argument, Shae could not bear to be around her grandfather and could not stand to\nlook at Hilo’s face, so she packed her bags and moved out of the Kaul house.\nLan was the only one to come see her the night before her departure. He took the ferry from\nJanloon and knocked on her hotel room door to offer to take her to dinner. Shae said she didn’t care\nwhere they went, so Lan suggested a nearby noodle shop. “After tomorrow, you’ll be eating Espenian\nfood, so let’s have something homey tonight,” he said. The restaurant was on the main thoroughfare\nof the port town. Neighboring bistros and bars had signs and menus written in Espenian, and on a\npleasant summer evening, off-duty Espenian military personnel crowded the open-air patios and\nconversed loudly on the sidewalks. There were no lanterns hanging in the shop windows; Lan and\nShae were not seated or served ahead of everyone else. Shae’s flight was not until tomorrow, but she\nalready felt as if she were in a different country.\nLan did not seem irritated at not being recognized and saluted. As they waited for their meals, he\ntook in the environs with thoughtful bemusement. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” he said, “if this is what\nthe whole world looks like one day—an unrecognizable blend, cultures and people mixed together.\nWhere will jade and clans and Green Bones fit in, I wonder?”\n“That’s for you to think about, not me.” In retrospect, she’d been rude to her brother, but at the\ntime, her jade was locked in a bank safe and she was still moody and ill from withdrawal.\n“You should eat more,” Lan said, when he saw that she hadn’t finished the food in her bowl.\n“You have a long, tiring trip ahead of you, and then you’ll be alone in a foreign country.”"

You’re the youngest in the family, and a\nwoman, and a Kaul, and none of that makes life easy on Kekon, but in Espenia, you’ll start out below\neveryone else. You’ll have to fight for every scrap of respect that you’re used to getting at home.”\n“Did Grandda send you to make a final attempt at discouraging me?” Shae asked.\nLan’s remonstrative stare made Shae avert her eyes. “No,” he said, coldly enough to make her\nfeel ashamed. “I’ve said that I support your decision, but I’m your older brother, and the Pillar, so that\ngives me enough extra life experience to tell you that no matter where you go, others will try to define\nyou. Unless you define yourself.”\n“I’m twenty-four years old, Lan,” Shae said. “I can take care of myself.”\n“I know you can,” Lan said sadly. The waiter came to clear their dishes. A swollen orange moon\nwas rippling in the narrow stretch of water that separated Euman Island from the skyline of Janloon,\nwhich Shae would soon watch fade from her airplane window and would not see again for two years.\n“Just try not to forget who you are,” her brother said.\nWhile several countries mark the end of the Many Nations War (Victory Day in Espenia, War’s End\nDay in Tun, Liberation Day in the Uwiwa Islands, to name a few), Kekon’s national holiday\ncommemorates the defeat of Shotarian occupation forces on the island and restoration of the country’s\nsovereignty fifty-two days prior to the signing of the international armistice. The official name of the\nholiday, Triumph of the Nation’s Heroes Over Foreign Oppression, is rarely used on account of its\nunwieldiness; it is referred to simply as Heroes Day.\nAs a child, Hilo had enjoyed Heroes Day, because in addition to being a day of patriotism, it was\na celebration of Green Bone culture. Kaul Du Academy and Wie Lon Temple School opened their\ndoors and put on public demonstrations of the jade disciplines. Movie theaters played a marathon of\nthe adventure films about Baijen, the legendary Green Bone warrior. Veterans like his grandfather and\nlate father were praised and honored. In the evening, there was a parade and fireworks. Afterward,\nHilo went to sleep smiling, feeling like a prince.\nAs Pillar of the clan, he dreaded Heroes Day, and more so this year than any other.

This year, he expected the holiday would be underscored with the tension of current anti-\nforeigner sentiment and would make the scandal over Shae’s past all the worse for No Peak. No\nwonder his sister was staying at home and not making any appearances today. She claimed to be\nfeeling unwell, but he wouldn’t have blamed her if she’d simply said that she’d rather skip the\nshitshow and the inevitability of having to see Ayt Mada’s smug face.\n“Forget the garbage Ayt and the newspapers are spewing,” Hilo had told her. “You have to get\nShip Street under control. Hami was in the room with the men who came to see me. He didn’t speak\nagainst you, but he didn’t stand up for you either. That’s not good, Shae.”\nHis sister seemed pale and much quieter than usual. “I’ll handle it,” she said.\n“If your people are behind you, it doesn’t matter what any of those other fuckers think, but they\nhave to be behind you.”\n“I said I’ll handle it,” Shae repeated. “Do you trust me?”\n“I don’t have a choice, do I?” Hilo had no intention of caving to pressure from inside or outside\nof the clan, but what if things got so bad that Shae no longer had the credibility to run the business\nside of No Peak? He didn’t want to contemplate the possibility of having to remove his sister from\nher post; he was certain that was exactly what Ayt Mada was hoping for. Three years ago, the\nMountain had tried to weaken Lan’s position by targeting Hilo for assassination; now they were doing\nthe same to him, undermining him by going after Shae.\nHilo went on the offense. Ten-year-old Koben Ato had recently fallen ill for a week from a\npotent stomach virus, a fact that was known only because the boy had begun his training at Wie Lon\nSchool as something of a minor celebrity. When questioned by the press about Shae’s past, Hilo\nanswered that the outrage ought to be focused instead on the more serious past misdeeds of clan\nleaders who were known for killing their own relatives. Hilo hoped out loud that Ayt’s nephew’s\nillness was nothing more sinister; perhaps the Koben family ought to be worried about the child\nmeeting as untimely a fate as his father.\nHis efforts deflected some of the attention, but had little effect otherwise. The idea that Ayt Mada\nwould target a child was shocking but unfounded, and even though it reminded people of her past\nfratricide, in today’s political climate, it seemed murdering one’s way into power was more easily\nforgiven than sleeping with a foreigner. No Peak remained in an infuriating position and Hilo did not\nyet know what to do about it. It sat near the front of his mind all of Heroes Day morning as he walked\nthrough Widow’s Park with a large contingent of No Peak clan faithful, laying flowers and fruit on the\nKaul family memorial and the graves of other Green Bones slain during the overthrow of Shotarian\noccupation during the Many Nations War.

This part of his schedule was actually pleasant, as he had\nhis family with him. Wen had dressed the boys in suits—even Ru wore a tiny vest and clip-on tie that\nhe’d already spit up on—and people were exclaiming over how handsome they were, which pleased\nHilo to no end. Niko ran between the gravestones, dirtying his shoes.\nThe afternoon, however, was an ordeal. Wen and the children went home, and Hilo was driven to\nthe Monument District where His Heavenship Prince Ioan III would make a grand public appearance\nin front of the Triumphal Palace. In portraits, the prince was depicted as a regal and stately man, but\nin person his heavy brow and small chin gave him the appearance of perpetual squinting confusion.\nHe performed his ceremonial and charitable duties with good-natured enthusiasm, though, and had\nproduced two sons and two daughters, so was quite popular with the public. When he came out of the\npalace and waved to the crowd, they cheered loudly.\nAs was custom on Heroes Day, the leaders of the Green Bone clans were in attendance to\ndemonstrate their fealty to the monarch of the country. They each in turn climbed the steps of the\npalace and knelt before the prince, declaring the service and loyalty of their clans. The traditional\nevent was a ceremonial reminder of the nation’s modern founding, when the jade warriors who\ntriumphed over foreign occupation had, in accordance with aisho, eschewed political power and\nushered in the reestablishment of the monarchy and the Royal Council.\nHilo smirked when Ayt Mada strode up the marble steps and lowered herself like a tiger\nconsenting to be patted by a child. The prince was a figurehead with no real power, but once a year,\npeople took heart and patriotic pride in the knowledge that even the most powerful Green Bones, the\nones who commanded true influence in society, were united and subservient to Kekon itself. That\nreassurance was particularly relevant now, with a foreign war raging not far away.\nHilo followed after his enemy and knelt on the palace’s landing, touching his forehead to the\nmarble. “Your Heavenship,” he said. “I, Kaul Hiloshudon, the Pillar of my clan, pledge No Peak to\nyour service. May you live three hundred years under the favor of the gods.”\nOnce that part of the pomp was over with, the prince’s retinue escorted His Heavenship down\nthe street to the public gardens behind Wisdom Hall, where he blessed the unveiling of a new statue\ncommemorating the famous wartime partnership of Ayt Yugontin and Kaul Seningtun—the Spear and\nthe Torch of Kekon. Hilo was required to be in attendance at this event as well and to stare at the\nbronze cast of his grandfather as a much younger man, standing straight and proud next to his\ncomrade and gazing off into the distance, presumably at Kekon’s glorious future.\nUpon last year’s declaration of truce between the clans, someone in the Janloon city government\nhad apparently thought it a good idea to commission public art to mark the reestablished harmony\nbetween Green Bones.

        "text": "had apparently thought it a good idea to commission public art to mark the reestablished harmony\nbetween Green Bones. Considering that the clans were currently engaged in a contest to undermine\nand ruin each other—a contest the Mountain appeared to be winning—the whole affair struck Hilo as\nironic.\nAfter the prince and a few other officials had said their words, Ayt took the microphone and\nspoke eloquently about the sort of man her adopted father had been—a brilliant general, an honorable\nGreen Bone, and above all, a principled patriot. “My father believed that with jade comes great\nresponsibility, and that Green Bones owe their loyalty to country above all else.” Ayt let her words\nhang in the air as her eyes moved over the assembly of people and settled on her rival Pillar, standing\nnear the front and scheduled to speak next. Hilo felt the weight of his enemy’s stare and the pressure\nof her thick aura bathing him in an unwelcome spotlight.\nAyt said, looking directly at Hilo, “The allegiance to a higher cause, to the safety to the country,\ntakes precedence over even the treasured bonds between friends and relatives. A strong leader must be\ncapable of setting aside sentiment and making painful decisions for the good of many.” Ayt’s message\nwas clear: Everything she had done to become Pillar of the Mountain—including murdering her\nineffectual playboy of an adopted brother and her father’s old guard—she had done for the greater\ngood of the clan and country. Kaul Hilo, in contrast, by stubbornly siding with his unworthy sister,\nwas no great leader.\nAyt turned back to the crowd and declared, “My father, if he were alive, would despair to see\nthat foreign interests have once again invaded our country, this time with the help of those who ought\nto be the staunchest defenders of our nation. As the daughter of the Spear of Kekon, as the Pillar of\nmy clan, I am deeply concerned.”\nShae had prepared a speech for Hilo to give; it contained innocuous Heroes Day platitudes and\nsome touching and amusing stories about Grandda. Hilo had come to this event determined to stick to\nthe text and not respond to Ayt’s goading, but his aggravation mounted steadily as Ayt continued\ntalking. “The Weather Man of the second-largest clan in the country is in thrall to foreign people and\nways. Her past actions prove that she is of weak character, not fit to be called Kekonese, and not to be\ntrusted in a position of power and influence. It’s time for my counterpart to listen to the concerns of\nthe public.”\nAyt Mada was co-opting what was supposed to be a feel-good speech about her father into a\npointed indictment of her rival. A few members of the Royal Council in attendance at the statue\nunveiling ceremony were shifting uncomfortably. Among the public who’d gathered to watch, some\nwere nodding, others were listening stone-faced or staring at Hilo, waiting for his reaction. Hilo’s\neyes were slits; he kept his expression stiff but knew his suppressed fury was Perceivable to any\nGreen Bone nearby.\n“Hilo-jen,” Kehn grumbled from behind Hilo’s shoulder in a low, uneasy voice, “we don’t have\nto stand here listening to all this shit. We could leave right now.”"

We could leave right now.”\nHilo did not answer his Horn; he could sense Ayt Mada’s aura humming in smug curiosity.\nCould she provoke him to explode in a temper in front of everyone? Would he finally bend to the\npressure and remove Shae as Weather Man, making No Peak appear guilty and weak, or stubbornly\nrefuse and watch his clan’s reputation plummet and his own hard-won fitness as Pillar come into\nquestion?\nHe did not Perceive Shae’s approach until she was right behind him. Her aura prickled like static\nagainst his, and when he turned in surprise, he saw that she was cutting a straight path toward him.\nHer hair was drawn back in a tight clasp, and in the sun, the jade gleamed at her throat. Her pale face\nwas set as firm as a mask. She paused as she came alongside him but barely glanced in his direction.\n“I thought you weren’t feeling well,” Hilo said. “What are you doing here?”\n“Ending this,” the Weather Man said, and stepped forward past him with the suddenness of a\nleap from a subway platform. He realized what she meant to do a second before she spoke, but by\nthen, she had crossed half the space to the podium.\n“Enough,” Shae declared, loudly enough to disrupt Ayt midsentence and be heard by those\nnearby. There was a ripple of astonishment through the crowd, and in the space where Ayt’s searing\naura met Shae’s like lava pouring against rocks. Shae continued advancing, implacably, cold as the\nmoon. “You’ve insulted and slandered me enough. You’ve called me a poor granddaughter, an unfit\nWeather Man, unworthy of jade, a traitor, and a whore.”\nShe stopped; the heartbeat of silence that fell was blistering. “Ayt Madashi, Pillar of the\nMountain, I offer you a clean blade.”\nSECOND INTERLUDE\nThe Two Thrones\nF\nollowing the Three Crowns era in Kekonese history, which ended with the self-destruction of the\nHunto royal line, the two conquering kingdoms—Jan in the north and Tiedo in the south—sought to\nmaintain peaceful relations in the time-honored way, by exchanging royal children. The second son of\nthe royal house of Tiedo was sent to the court of Jan. The monarch of Jan had three children but only\none son, so the eldest daughter was offered up instead as a hostage to Tiedo.\nIn Tiedo, the captive Jan princess and the firstborn prince fell deeply and fortuitously in love and\nwere married. Once the prince succeeded his father, however, his wife pressured him to attack her\nhomeland of Jan in a bid to rule all of Kekon. Historians debate how much she was driven by political\nambition, blind confidence in her husband, or ill feelings toward the family that had traded her away.\nThe new king was initially hesitant, but after his younger brother in Jan perished in a suspicious\ntraining accident, he acted on his wife’s encouragement and declared war.\nTheir rival, the prince of Jan, was intelligent but sickly.

        "text": "training accident, he acted on his wife’s encouragement and declared war.\nTheir rival, the prince of Jan, was intelligent but sickly. Though it was rare for women to be\ntrained as Green Bones at that time, his younger sister was allowed to learn the jade disciplines. She\nmarried a warrior who would become a famous general in the Jan army, and she subsequently became\na key figure in the military campaign against her sister and brother-in-law from Tiedo. The final\nvictory of Jan, two hundred years later, unified the island under one monarchy with its capital city\nlocated on the northern coast, where it remains to this day. Although the strife between the northern\nand southern kingdoms extended long past the lives of its instigators, this segment of Kekonese\nhistory is still known as the Warring Sisters period.\nThe Kekonese hold an overall negative view of this era, as the prolonged conflict weakened the\ncountry and reduced the population of its jade warriors, allowing successive foreign invaders to gain a\nfoothold on the island. Nevertheless, judging by the disproportionate number of Kekonese novels and\nmovies set during this time, the love story between the traitorous Jan princess and the Tiedo prince is\nconsidered one of history’s great romances, and the resulting war between the two sisters recounted as\none of its tragic dramas. Kekon’s most famous classical play about this period, The Two Thrones,\nbegins with an oft-quoted line that harkens to Deitist philosophy regarding the origin of earthly\nconflict: “Out of small resentments, spring great wars.”\nCHAPTER\n31\nStand Your Ground\nT\nhe duel was set for the following morning, as it would be uncouth to spill blood on a national\nholiday and detract from the planned Heroes Day festivities. The combatants would meet in Juro\nWood, halfway between the Ayt and Kaul residences. Shae knew that she ought to go to bed early, but\nthe idea of sleep seemed impossible considering this might be her last night alive. Around midnight,\nwith the popping of the parade fireworks still sounding intermittently over the city, she crept into the\nprayer room of the main house and knelt on the stiff cushion in front of the small shrine. The dark\ncertainty, the sense of cold purpose she’d felt earlier was nowhere to be found. All she felt now was\nnauseating fear and dread.\nShae was a heavily jaded and skilled Green Bone who had graduated at the top of her class at\nKaul Dushuron Academy. Now she spent most of her days behind a desk or in meetings. She\nmaintained a routine of daily morning practice and semiregular private coaching sessions, but unlike\nHilo, she had not been training diligently to keep her martial abilities at a peak. If she’d had any\ninkling she would be in this situation, she would’ve booked Master Aido solid for the past six months.\nAyt Madashi wore more jade and had killed more men in single combat than any woman Green Bone\nin recent history. Years had passed since her violent ascension to Pillar; perhaps Ayt had gotten lax as\nwell. Shae hoped that was the case but was not optimistic.\nShe bent her head. “Old Uncle in Heaven, judge me the greener of your kin tomorrow, if it be\nso,” she murmured in prayer to Jenshu the Monk, the One Who Returned, the patron god of Green"

        "text": "She bent her head. “Old Uncle in Heaven, judge me the greener of your kin tomorrow, if it be\nso,” she murmured in prayer to Jenshu the Monk, the One Who Returned, the patron god of Green\nBones. She paused. “And if you judge otherwise, at least give me credit for a dramatic attempt.”\nThe genuine surprise on Ayt’s face that afternoon had given her one pure moment of satisfaction.\nIf the Pillar of the Mountain had considered the possibility of Shae challenging her with a clean blade,\nshe must’ve dismissed the idea. Her target was a young woman in an office—not a testosterone-\ndriven and jade-hungry male Fist. Not someone eager to die.\nTwo seconds of mutual disbelief had hung between the two women, and then Ayt’s jade aura had\nswelled ominously as she leveled a stare at Shae that seemed to vanish the presence of all the stunned\npeople watching them. Ayt put down the papers of her speech. In the unnatural silence, the\nmicrophone magnified the rustle of the pages. The Pillar of the Mountain stepped out from behind the\npodium and said, in a clear, firm voice that needed no amplification, “I accept.”\nAfter he’d gotten over the initial shock of what she’d done, Hilo had been, unsurprisingly,\nfurious. Not even the Pillar could reverse a challenge between two willing parties once it was issued\nand accepted, but from the explosive roar of his jade aura Shae thought Hilo might try to kill her\nhimself before Ayt got around to it. In the Duchesse after escaping the ensuing hubbub, he’d struggled\nto find words. “What the fuck, Shae?” he shouted.\n“It’s the only way,” Shae whispered, numbed by what she’d done. The only way to quash the\nscandal, to erase all doubts, to silence Ayt Mada and anyone who accused her of being too Espenian,\noverly influenced by foreigners, a naive woman who was not trustworthy. It didn’t matter if Hilo kept\nher in the role or not; after Ayt’s damaging accusations, she would never again be taken seriously as\nWeather Man unless she answered the critics unequivocally.\n“Stop this stupidity while you still can,” Hilo had ordered. “Take back the offer of a clean blade.\nYou’re green enough, sure, greener than most men, but you can’t expect to beat Ayt Mada, not unless\nyou have some trick you’re not telling me about, or you’ve been secretly training at night all year.”\nFrom Shae’s silence, he deduced this was not the case and exploded again. “Are you trying to get\nyourself killed, then? Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?”\nIn truth, Shae had felt a terrified urge to retract the offer as soon as it left her mouth, but the\nfamiliarity of Hilo’s temper jolted her back into the state of inescapable logic that she’d summoned\nearlier. Reneging on the challenge would destroy whatever standing she had left and irreparably\nshame No Peak. Hilo, who’d fought many duels in his life, knew this, so the fact that he’d even\nsuggested it was oddly touching. “It’s done, Hilo,” she said. “I can’t back out.”"

        "text": "suggested it was oddly touching. “It’s done, Hilo,” she said. “I can’t back out.”\n“She’s right,” Kehn said from the driver’s seat. “Ayt’s the one who caused offense. Also, no one\nin No Peak has actually seen the bitch fight. Shae-jen has as good a chance as anyone.”\n“I didn’t ask for your opinion,” Hilo snarled at his Horn, something Shae had never seen before.\n“Ayt’s always searching for ways to get at us. Now she has a clean blade and the chance to cut off my\nlittle sister’s head with everyone watching. She’s got to be fucking ecstatic!”\nShae had to admit there was a painful irony to the situation. Four years ago, she’d been\nambivalent about even returning to Janloon; now she was sacrificing a relationship, a pregnancy, and\nmost likely her own life to defend her position and reputation as Weather Man of No Peak. She was\nnot usually the bold and reckless one—that had always been Hilo’s role in the family.\nHow things change. Then again, all the actions Ayt Mada had publicized as evidence of her weak\ncharacter—dating a foreigner, working for the Espenians, taking off her jade, and leaving the clan to\nbe educated abroad—had been rebellious declarations, attempts to prove herself equal or better than\nher brothers. She wanted what she was told by others she couldn’t have, was willing to dramatically\nself-immolate rather than accept terms forced upon her. So no, some things had not changed after all.\nThe door to the prayer room slid open and Hilo came in. Shae did not get up or turn around to\nface her brother, but to her surprise, he knelt beside her and touched his head to the ground the\ncustomary three times. She had never even seen him come into this room before.\n“I didn’t think you believed in the gods,” she said when he straightened.\n“I don’t,” Hilo said, “but the feeling’s mutual, so maybe they won’t hold it against me.” His jade\naura was still humming at a higher pitch than usual, but he was calmer than he had been. Perhaps Wen\nhad talked to him; she always seemed able to smooth her husband’s thoughts. Shae could hear her\nsister-in-law’s footsteps upstairs, pacing with Ru to settle him down, and she could Perceive Niko’s\nsoft energy, asleep. She thought about how she might not live to see either of her nephews grow up,\nand an ache bloomed in her chest.\nHilo muttered, “If this is supposed to be peace, I think I prefer war.”\nShae glanced at him. “Ayt had us in a bind, and she knew it. Whether I resigned or not, No Peak\nwould be damaged. We would be seen as weaker than the Mountain. Tearing me down would’ve been\nonly the start.” She faced the shrine again, chin raised. “No matter what happens tomorrow, we’ll\nhave taken that leverage away from her.”\n“As if that’ll do us much good if you’re dead.” Hilo turned to her with a ferocious glare. “You\ndidn’t listen to me; you never do. You did your own crazy thing as usual. So now you have to go\nthrough with it and win.” He seized her upper arm in a painful grip and forced her to meet his eyes."

So now you have to go\nthrough with it and win.” He seized her upper arm in a painful grip and forced her to meet his eyes.\n“It’s true what Kehn said. You have a chance to put Ayt Mada in the ground. We both know that\nanything can happen in a fight, and a duel is fought in here”—he tapped the center of her forehead\nwith a forefinger—“before blades are drawn. So tell me you’ll do it, Shae. You’ll cut off Ayt’s fucking\nhead and put an end to all this.”\nShae felt her bones prickling from the insistent pressure of her brother’s aura. She forced a\nswallow out of her shrunken throat. “I’ll do it,” she said, her voice muted but steady. “I’ll win\ntomorrow.”\nHilo released her and stood up, his fierce expression unchanged. “Then stop sitting in here\npretending to talk to the gods. Go to bed and get enough rest. Or else get your moon blade and\npractice, put your mind in the right place.” He opened the door. “I’ll be in the training hall.”\nIn the morning, Shae rose and dressed in comfortable pants, fitted nylon top, traditional leather vest,\nand soft-soled shoes. She tied her hair back and examined herself in the mirror, debating how much of\nher jade to wear. Combatants hoping for every modicum of advantage wore all their jade into a duel,\nbut that meant losing it all if one was defeated. Green Bones who were heavily jaded and thus gained\nlittle additional martial benefit from carrying their entire arsenal might be advised to think of their\njade more prudently, as family wealth that they’d rather see passed on to family members instead of\nadorning the body of an enemy. Notwithstanding the promise of victory she’d made to Hilo in the\nprayer room last night, it was in Shae’s nature to be realistic about her chances. After a long moment\nof consideration, she removed her earrings and bracelets, leaving in place her anklets and two-tier\nchoker.\nShe selected her best moon blade—twenty-nine and a half inches in length, with a slightly\ncurved twenty-and-a-half-inch single-edged blade of the finest tempered Da Tanori steel and a hilt\nstippled with small jade stones. She was not remotely hungry, but she cracked an egg into hot\nporridge and forced herself to eat. She looked around at her surroundings, thinking that the house was\nnice and Wen had decorated it well—hardwood flooring and dark furniture with clean lines contrasted\nwith the soft throw pillows, light walls, and creamy drapes.\nThe place was too large for one person, though. Shae thought of Maro, of all the ignored\nmessages now filling up the tape in her answering machine, and her throat closed, making it\nimpossible to finish the last bites of her breakfast. Guilt and regret swelled and settled below her gut\nlike bloat. She ached, more desperately than she’d expected, to see Maro’s face, to hear his voice, to\nseize the chance to tell him that she did in fact love him. She knew that at last, when it was too late.\nShe wished she’d thought of writing him a letter, but there was no time to do so properly, and"

Maro had never dueled, had walked away rather than spill\nblood or risk his life to satisfy traditional notions of Green Bone honor. He’d tell her to do the same.\nShe washed and dried her single bowl and spoon, put them away, and turned off all the house\nlights. Then she walked outside to where Hilo and the Maiks waited by the Duchesse.\nThe drive was quiet. The darkness under Hilo’s eyes suggested that he had not slept any more\nthan Shae had the previous night. He did not speak, and the Maik brothers, taking their cues from\nhim, didn’t either. The morning after a holiday, traffic was light, and it didn’t take long to get to the\nGarrison House & Gardens in Juro Wood. Shae suspected that Ayt Mada had chosen the location for\nthe symbolism. The Garrison House was a colonial mansion of red tiles and white colonnades; the\nresidence of the Shotarian governor during the occupation period, it had been spared from destruction\nand turned into a national historic landmark containing a museum and public gardens. Shae and Ayt\nwould be facing each other on the lawn, with the country’s most visible symbol of past foreign\ndomination looming in the backdrop.\nCreeping warmth in the air promised a hot day to come, but the sky was thick with clouds and a\nlayer of summer smog hung low over the city, creating a diffuse, sunless gloom. As the Duchesse\npulled up to the curb in front of the public gardens, Shae saw an enormous crowd bordering the lawn.\nSome people carried cameras and others had spread blankets on the ground. For a second, Shae\nthought they had interrupted some public event and would have to move the location of the duel.\nThen it dawned on her that the duel was the public event. Of course, dueling was not uncommon—\nbut this was not a common duel. News of Shae’s challenge had created a storm of overnight attention.\nClean blades between the Pillar and the Weather Man of the two largest clans in the country was\ndramatic enough, but moreover, there had never been a duel between two women of such high rank in\ntheir respective clans. Only in the postwar generation, with the country’s population of male Green\nBones depleted, had it become more commonplace for girls to be trained to wear jade. These days,\none in five graduates from the nation’s martial schools were female, but most men still scorned to\nduel a woman, and duels between women, even Fists, were often smirked at as something of a joke.\nThis contest would not be a joke. Shae and Ayt Mada would be making history, no matter the\noutcome. Social progress, Kekonese-style, Shae mused. Equal opportunity to die by the blade.\nShe closed her eyes for a minute before getting out of the car.

        "text": "She closed her eyes for a minute before getting out of the car. Even when the mind is\ndetermined, the body objects vehemently to the possibility of injury and death. Shae’s hands had gone\nclammy, and there was a tightness in her chest that she tried to alleviate with controlled breaths. She\nwondered if her thudding pulse was as Perceivable to every nearby Green Bone as it was to her. It\noccurred to her that her classmates from Belforte Business School in Windton would be horrified and\nflabbergasted by what she was about to do. Oddly, the thought made her smile.\nTar got out and opened the back door for her and Hilo; the spectators edged forward eagerly but\nkept a respectful distance from the intimidating presence of No Peak’s leaders as they stepped out\nonto the lawn. Seconds after their arrival, a long, sleek, silver Stravaconi Monarch pulled up behind\nthe Duchesse. Ayt Mada emerged, along with her Horn and two Fists. Ayt appeared unruffled by the\npresence of the crowd; she nodded casually toward the Mountain loyalists who called out and saluted\nher. She was wearing a black tank top and comfortable silk pants with a tied drawstring. Her hair was\npulled back into a tight ponytail. A pair of sunglasses perched on top of her head. As she walked to\nthe center of the lawn, she removed them and handed them to Nau Suen, who tucked them into the\nbreast pocket of his shirt as if he regularly held on to the Pillar’s sunglasses during duels. Ayt looked\nas if she were stopping by the event in between running Sixthday errands, except for the fact that she\nwas carrying her thirty-two-inch jade-hilted moon blade slung over one shoulder. All of her jade sat in\nits usual place, coiled in silver bracelets up both her arms.\nThe time had come. Shae drew her moon blade and held it out to Hilo. Her brother turned his\nhead to stare across the lawn at Ayt and her people. He turned back slowly, looked down at Shae’s\nblade, and spat on the white metal for luck. Shae opened her mouth to say something—she was not\neven sure what—but Hilo dropped his hands onto her shoulders. His grip and aura fell on her like a\nwarm lead vest. Leaning close, he brought his cheek next to hers and whispered into her ear. “Four\ncars full of our Fists and Fingers are on their way here, to block off the Lo Low Street tunnel and\nevery road out of this place. There are others headed to the Ayt mansion, to the Factory, to half a\ndozen other Mountain properties in the city.” His voice was soft and chillingly devoid of inflection.\n“Some blades can’t be cleaned.”\nThe iciness of Hilo’s words ran down Shae’s back in a wave of abrupt understanding. Unlike her,\nhe had not been awake all night worrying or praying; he’d been making military preparations. If Shae\nfell under Ayt’s sword, Hilo would not allow their enemies to leave the grounds alive. He would break\nthe immutable law of the clean blade; he would take forbidden vengeance on her killer and plunge the\nclans, and the entire city, back into all-out war.\nShae was horrified.

She was risking her life to clear her name and her clan’s reputation by\nsolving a dispute of personal honor in the old way, the Green Bone way, under the eyes of Old Uncle\nand in adherence to rules that all Kekonese held as inviolable stricture. Duels were traditionally meant\nto contain personal feuds and prevent them from escalating into family or clan vendettas. Breaking\nthe pact of the clean blade would be unacceptable; it would put all the fault for the resumption of war\nsquarely on No Peak. Hilo was a Green Bone to his core and the Pillar of the clan; for him to so\nflagrantly break the moral code they lived by—it would ruin everything. It would make a mockery of\nthe jade warrior honor she was dueling to uphold in the first place.\nBefore Shae could put any of these thoughts into words, Hilo stepped away from her, his\nexpression dark and unreadable. He turned and walked to the corner where the Maik brothers waited,\nand Shae was alone in the center of the lawn, save for the impatient red intensity of Ayt Mada,\nstanding across from her, moon blade already drawn, waiting to begin.\nShae scrambled to regain her focus. She wondered for an instant if Hilo was bluffing—if this\nwas his twisted way of motivating her to survive the duel—but she had no time to dwell on the idea.\nAn anticipatory hush had fallen over the crowd; she heard the clicking of camera shutters around her.\nInnumerable heartbeats were rising in her Perception, loud and seemingly in time with her own, all of\nthem eager and waiting. Standing out from the general multitude were the jade auras of Green Bones\nfrom both clans who’d gathered to witness this event, one that was supposedly a matter of personal\nhonor between two people, but that everyone knew was far more than that. Janlooners wanted the\nclans to hold to the truce, to respect territorial lines and cooperate to combat crime and smuggling and\ncurrent international pressures, but they had nevertheless come out enthusiastically at a moment’s\nnotice to see blood spilled between the Mountain and No Peak.\nShae faced her opponent and touched the flat of her blade to her forehead in salute. Ayt did the\nsame. Gone was Ayt’s casual demeanor. There was a frightening quality to her stillness now, an\nalmost reptilian poise in the way she stood erect and regarded the younger woman, waiting for her to\nattack first. In Shae’s acutely sharp Perception, Ayt was a column of red energy, the inside of a coal\nfurnace, its painful heat blotting out everything else. The longer she stared at it in her mind, the more\nunassailable it would seem; she would lose her nerve. Shae gathered her Strength and rushed in with a\nburst of speed, moon blade flashing downward in an opening diagonal cross slash aimed at opening\nAyt Mada’s torso from left shoulder to opposing hip.\nAyt slid left at the edge of the weapon’s reach, deftly deflected Shae’s next cut, and spun low to\nthe ground, hair whipping around her neck, her extended blade a blur of steel.

For an instant, white metal rang against white metal, Strength clashed against Strength, the jade\nauras of the two women vibrated with impact; then Ayt’s blade disengaged, changed direction like the\ndarting tail of a fish, and shot a deadly path to Shae’s throat.\nShae jerked her head out of the way and threw her Steeled arm up in instinctive defense; Ayt’s\nmoon blade sheared against her raised forearm, the razor edge parting skin but stopping short of\nmuscle and bone. With her attention on Ayt’s weapon as it passed inches from her face, Shae nearly\nfailed to Perceive the Channeling blow that Ayt thrust with her left hand. It drove toward Shae’s\ncenter like a sharpened metal rod, aiming to punch through heart and lungs.\nShae twisted her torso out of the way, battening herself with Steel, her rib cage shuddering with\nconcentrated jade energy as she sucked in the deadly momentum of Ayt’s energy and countered in\nblind desperation: a quick, jabbing Channeling strike to the sternum, followed by an unaimed\nDeflection that nevertheless blasted her opponent in the midsection. Ayt stumbled backward several\nfeet, lips parted in a grimace. Shae saw the Pillar’s eyes widen and her normally perfect composure\nfissure as the realization struck them both at the same time: Shae stood a chance of winning. In the\nopening seconds of the duel, anyone could see that Ayt Mada was a superlative jade fighter, a\npowerful, deliberate combatant, well deserving of her reputation, but Shae was fast and talented and\nperhaps most importantly, a dozen years younger, a Green Bone in her physical prime.\nA moment of emotional stalemate seemed to pass between them. Then Ayt’s jade aura lit with\nthe violence of an exploding star, just as a surge of adrenaline and odd elation caught feverish hold of\nShae’s brain. Ayt came at her with weapon upraised and lips curled back, and with a wild cry of\neffort, Shae flew Light at her, blade slicing across in a deadly horizontal blur.\nIt became difficult for anyone watching the contest to follow the movement of the opposing\nmoon blades as the duelists sent them singing against each other, seeking open angles, striving with\nequal ferocity to connect metal with flesh. Spectators murmured in alarm and scrambled to the edge\nof the lawn to make more space for the fighters as they raged across the field. Shae’s reality\ntelescoped to the desperate purity of the fight. Her conscious mind all but shut down; only Perception,\ntraining, and reflexes could possibly save her from the onslaught. She saw Ayt’s face contort in a snarl\nof impatience as she lashed out with a flurry of darting, unpredictable slashes meant to overwhelm\nand confuse her opponent’s sense of both sight and Perception.

Cuts rained down on Shae’s arms and\ntorso; her Steel trembled under the strain of constant flexing and her lungs heaved like bellows,\nscalded with exertion. She sensed rather than saw the impending killing blow—an upward thrust that\nwould pierce the hollow of her throat. Instead of blocking with her own blade, she threw a tight\nDeflection, just enough to shift Ayt’s aim; the stab passed inches from her left cheek as her own blade\nlashed out for her enemy’s neck.\nAyt barely twisted away from the lethal maneuver; Shae pressed the attack with a quick upward\nslash, and a bloody gash opened across the side of Ayt’s head, bisecting her left ear and taking half of\nit clean off.\nShae heard the collective intake of breath from the watching crowd a split second before she\nPerceived her opponent’s pain and rage. A slashed ear was a minor injury compared to the killing\nblow Shae had intended, but there are few things in Kekonese culture more symbolic than a missing\near. Ayt touched the blood on the side of her face in disbelief. For a fraction of a second, Shae was\nequally astonished. Some part of her had not expected Ayt to be a mere mortal, a woman of flesh and\nblood like herself, someone who would bleed if cut, someone who could be killed—and then she\nsnapped back to her senses. She was tiring rapidly and could not keep fighting like this much longer;\nthese brief seconds while Ayt was unbalanced—she had to take immediate advantage of them, win\nwhile she had the chance.\nShae sidestepped and committed to the momentary opening, throwing her weight into a cleaving,\ndecapitating strike. Far from still being distracted by her superficial injury, Ayt seemed to have been\nanticipating the move; she shifted her position and met the attack head-on, slamming her own blade\ninto the path of Shae’s weapon with so much force that Shae felt the impact reverberate through her\nframe and clatter into her teeth. For an instant, they were both rooted in the concussion of the blow.\nAyt’s roaring jade aura crashed over Shae like a tidal wave; the churn of their desperately grappling\nenergies filled every bit of her Perception. Faster than a striking cobra, Ayt’s left hand shot out and\nseized Shae’s sword hand, crushing down on the meat of her thumb in a grip of extraordinary\nStrength. With a twist, she forced Shae’s weapon downward and vertical, and with Steeled forearm,\nknocked the blade out of her opponent’s weakened grip. It happened in less than a second: Shae’s\nmoon blade went flying, and Ayt sliced across with her own weapon, snarling as she threw Strength\ninto a disemboweling cut.\nShae Steeled for all her life was worth. It was not fast or hard enough; pain lanced across her\nabdomen like flame along a line of blasting powder. A sudden hot wetness flowed down the front of\nher pants as if her bladder had given out all at once.

Time elongated and turned the\nworld strangely still. In the periphery of her Perception, she sensed Ayt Mada’s murderous triumph\ndescending along with the executioner’s swing of her blade. With every particle of remaining\nwherewithal left to her, Shae staggered backward and fell to her knees in the grass, arms wide. “Ayt-\njen!” she cried out hoarsely, her head thrown back. “I concede!”\nShe closed her eyes; at any second, she would die. “I concede,” she declared again. She could\nbarely recognize her own voice; it seemed to be coming from someone else. It was hard to think, to\ngrasp words and string them together into a final effort, a thin, calculated lifeline. “You are the greater\nGreen Bone warrior, truly a worthy daughter of the Spear of Kekon. My life and my jade are yours\nfor the taking. If you’re merciful enough to spare me, it’ll be only so I can follow your example and\ncontinue contributing what little worth I have to the good of Kekon.”\nA heartbeat passed. Another. The pain of the stomach wound was unbearable; she wanted to\nslump to the ground in the damp grass and curl feebly around her injury, but she held herself still.\nWith her eyes closed, she Perceived Ayt’s flicker of hesitation; the blade paused in its descent. Less\nthan ten meters away, Hilo’s jade aura roared like a monster in a pit, its reckless, savage intent\nunmistakable. Shae opened her eyes and looked into Ayt’s maddened face, the left side of it smeared\nwith blood, and then past the other woman’s shoulder. Two large cars were blocking off the two-lane\nroad up to the Garrison House & Gardens. Another two had pulled up along the curb behind Ayt’s\nsilver Stravaconi. A dozen No Peak Fists were coming out of the vehicles. The watching civilians\nwere looking fearfully from Ayt to Shae to Hilo, to the surrounding soldiers of both clans, whose\nhands had gone for the hilts of their weapons.\nDespite the agony in her torso and the clamor of her own panicked heartbeat, Shae met her\nopponent’s eyes and saw the fearsome expression shift into bitter understanding as Ayt too Perceived\nthe arrival of Hilo’s warriors, the sudden dangerous shift in the air. Even now, facing death, Shae was\ndesperately playing what cards remained to her. With the attention of the entire country on them, she\nhad fought bravely and well, in true Kekonese fashion defended her reputation and that of her clan,\nand ultimately conceded the duel to the better warrior. There had been a moment of opportunity for\nAyt to take Shae’s life fairly in battle—but that moment was lost. Clean-bladed dueling was an\nhonorable tradition; striking down an opponent who’d surrendered was not.\nKilling Shae now, as she knelt injured and disarmed, would show the Pillar of the Mountain to\nbe merciless and bloodthirsty, would publicly confirm that she was who Hilo had been reminding\neveryone she was—the woman who’d seized power by having her own brother murdered in his sleep.\nThe sort of person who would behead a defeated opponent on her knees might do anything, might"

Ayt’s image as the patriotic warrior stateswoman,\nwhich she had been carefully cultivating for over two years as she rebuilt the reputation of her clan,\nwould be ruined. And Hilo would seize the justification he needed—if he needed any at all—to turn\nthe scene into a bloodbath.\nShae’s blood soaking into the dry dirt raised a pungent metallic smell that stung her nostrils.\nWith shaking fingers, she fumbled for the clasp of her jade choker and broke it. The twin strings fell\nfrom her neck, sliding from her skin as easily as blood from a vein. She held it out to Ayt, her arms\nshaking even from the small effort. She could Perceive the uncertainty, the frantic calculation, behind\nthe burning gaze the other woman fixed on her. Ayt was furiously debating whether to eliminate an\nenemy now or preserve the moral high ground, and she could not be certain whether Kaul Hilo would\ngo so far as to break the pact of clean blades, not to mention the truce between the Mountain and No\nPeak, and send them all careening back into clan war. Ayt’s eyes narrowed. Shae’s mind rang with the\ncrowded Perception of all the people watching and waiting with growing alarm and held breath.\nAyt lowered her blade. She reached out and seized Shae’s jade in her fist. When she spoke, she\nraised her voice so all those nearby could hear. “You’ve acted disgracefully in the past, Kaul\nShaelinsan. Nevertheless, it would be a waste to kill a fellow Green Bone at a time when Kekon\nneeds every one of us.” The Pillar of the Mountain wiped the length of both sides of her moon blade\nagainst the thigh of one silk pant leg. “My blade is clean.”\nNoisy exclamations of relief and appreciation erupted from the sidelines. The collective fever\npitch of tension from the auras of the waiting Green Bones settled back to a wary hum. Ayt leaned in,\nclose enough to speak to Shae alone. Shae stared at her jade in Ayt’s grip with curious horror, as if it\nwere a part of her own body—a severed hand, her heart, her entrails—that the other woman was\nholding between them. The left side of Ayt’s head was grisly where part of the ear was missing, but\nshe paid it no heed. “I promised you before, you foolish girl, that you would live to see your clan in\nruins,” Ayt whispered. “It would be dishonest for me to kill you until then.” She turned calmly and\nwalked into the posse of congratulatory Mountain fighters.\nThe jade withdrawal and blood loss hit Shae simultaneously, like a typhoon ripping her violently\noff the face of the earth. Everything fractured and tilted away as her weakened body collapsed\nbeneath her. Dimly, she was aware of a great deal of commotion: Hilo and the Maiks crouching over\nher, the family’s Green Bone physician, Dr. Truw, pressing down on her wound and Channeling into\nher, forcing tingling warmth into her shivering limbs.

Other people speaking as if from a great\ndistance: “Get her into the ambulance.” Shae inhaled the smell of the grass pressed under her cheek\nand let unconsciousness drag her away from it all.\nCHAPTER\n32\nOverdue Conversations\nS\nhae required a blood transfusion and twelve days in Janloon General Hospital before the surgeon\nand Dr. Truw cleared her to return home. At her request, no one but immediate family had been\nallowed to visit her while she was in the hospital. Addled with painkillers and shaking with jade\nwithdrawal, the last thing she wanted was to answer questions from reporters, be seen in this state by\nany of her Ship Street colleagues, or even to guiltily face Maro. As a result, when she got back to her\nown house, she felt utterly disconnected from the world and overwhelmed by how to even start\ngetting her footing back. Although she’d been trained at the Academy and had fought and killed\nbefore, by Green Bone standards, and by Kaul family standards in particular, she’d enjoyed a\nrelatively safe existence: spoiled by her grandfather, protected by Lan, groomed for the business side\nof the clan, living abroad in Espenia, then working on the top floor of an office tower. She had never\nbeen so near death before, and it humbled her.\nNow she stood naked in front of the mirror in her bathroom. A long pink scar, fading to white at\nthe edges and puckered by stitches, ran across her abdomen, distorting the shape of her navel. It still\ngave her pain when she twisted or bent at the waist. A dull jade withdrawal headache sat at the base of\nher skull and every muscle in her body felt leaden. She still had her jade earrings, bracelets, and\nanklets, which Hilo had brought to her in the hospital when she was strong enough to wear them, but\nher neck was pale and bare without her two-tier jade choker.\nShae dressed and called Woon on the phone. He came over immediately, and in a mutual flood of\nrelief, they embraced each other in the doorway. “Shae-jen,” Woon said, his voice unsteady, “I\nunderstand why you acted as you did, but at the time, I thought I was about to lose you as well. If that\nhad happened, I think I would’ve gone to the Pillar and begged for death.”\n“Don’t ever think such a thing, Papi-jen,” Shae said, a little shaken by his words. They went into\nher kitchen. Shae leaned heavily against the table as she pulled out a seat; Woon put a steadying hand\nunder her elbow and helped her into it. “How bad has it been, Shae-jen?” he asked, his brow deeply\ncreased with concern.\n“Withdrawal?” Shae grimaced. “It’s manageable, and it won’t last long.” She was achy and\nexhausted and felt at times as if there were cobwebs over her eyes and ears, but she was not\nincapacitated. She still had her jade abilities. Withdrawal symptoms felt worse piled on top of her\nphysical injuries, but they weren’t nearly as severe as they would’ve been if she’d lost all her jade,"

Withdrawal symptoms felt worse piled on top of her\nphysical injuries, but they weren’t nearly as severe as they would’ve been if she’d lost all her jade,\nand she knew from experience they would pass within a few weeks.\nWoon took what she’d said to mean something different. “I’ll bring you jade from the clan’s\nstores,” he said. “How much do you need to have a new choker made?”\nShae shook her head. “I don’t want a new one.” There was nothing to stop her from drawing\nfrom the Kaul family’s reserves of wealth to replace the jade she’d lost in the duel, but after nearly\ndying in the most public manner possible, she felt as if it would be dishonest, personally diminishing\nin some way, to be seen wearing a new choker made of jade she had not fought for. It would seem as\nif the near-fatal stand she’d taken had no lasting impact, as if what she’d lost that day could be so\neasily restored. Ayt Mada could not grow back the missing portion of her ear. Shae would carry the\nabsence of her jade openly, like a scar.\nWoon looked unsure at her refusal, but understanding how personal the decision was, he\naccepted her explanation without argument. Shae asked him to tell her what had happened over the\npast twelve days. The Weather Man’s Shadow had been staunchly holding her place on Ship Street.\nThe decisions that had to be made, he’d made in a way he judged she would approve; all other\nquestions and requests he’d dealt with by saying the Weather Man would answer them upon her\nreturn.\nWoon had done one thing she had not anticipated: He’d gone to Hami Tumashon and asked the\nMaster Luckbringer if he intended to resign from his position. The two highest-ranking men in the\nWeather Man’s office had had a respectful working relationship stretching back years, to when Woon\nwas Lan’s Pillarman, and Hami a senior Luckbringer under Doru, but Hami had not taken the\nquestion kindly, seeing it for what it was: an accusation of disloyalty.\n“Only the Pillar or the Weather Man can ask for my resignation, Woon-jen,” Hami had answered\ncoldly. “I’m tempted to offer you a clean blade, but I think we can agree that any other duels would\nbe anticlimactic at this point.” The Master Luckbringer continued to manage the day-to-day activities\non Ship Street with all of his usual competence, but after the confrontation, he and Woon spoke little\nbeyond what was necessary.\nWhen Woon had filled her in on everything she needed to know, Shae felt as if it wouldn’t have\nbeen so bad to have stayed in the hospital a few more days. “I can’t thank you enough, Papi-jen,” she\nsaid. “And I’m sorry that I left you with so much to deal with at a time when you should’ve been\nhappily planning your wedding.” Woon was to be married in a few months. Shae had not met his\nfiancée but had seen a very pretty photograph of her on the man’s desk.\nWoon’s jade aura shifted at the mention of the wedding. “It was hardly anything compared to\nwhat you went through.

Besides, Kiya and my mother are doing all the work; I only need to show\nup.” He added, “However, the next time you challenge Ayt Madashi with a clean blade, if you could\nbe more considerate about the timing, that would be appreciated.” Woon’s sense of humor, when it\nmade an appearance, was so deadpan that Shae wasn’t sure whether to laugh.\nWhen she returned to Ship Street the following day, she felt physically stronger and less\nmuddled after having slept for fourteen hours in her own bed. An abrupt silence accompanied her\narrival into the building. As she walked from the elevator to her office, people stopped in their\nconversations and paused in their work. Shae’s Perception was sluggish from the combination of jade\nloss and days of convalescence, but she sensed the wave of trepidation that spread down the corridor.\nA man on her left brought his clasped hands up to his forehead and dipped into a formal salute.\n“Kaul-jen,” he called out. “Welcome back.”\nThe woman at the desk next to him followed suit, as did another, and the Luckbringers near them\nstood up from their chairs and went to the doors of their offices or the entries of their cubicles and\nsaluted the Weather Man as she passed. Shae saw tenuous smiles on their faces, congratulatory and\nconsoling in equal measure. She’d lost the duel and the majority of her jade, but she’d defended\nherself and her clan from slander. She’d fought as well as anyone could’ve expected and shown\nherself willing to die for personal and family reputation. In those most critical aspects, she’d put to\nrest the question of her integrity and fitness as a Green Bone leader.\nShae’s secretary jumped up and followed her into her office. “Kaul-jen, Councilman Kowi and\ntwo Lantern Men have been coming into the building for the past two mornings and waiting in the\nlobby to speak to you. Do you want to see them or should I send them away?”\n“I’ll see them,” Shae said. Behind her, people went back to their work as if there was nothing out\nof the ordinary.\nKowi and the two Lantern Men were admitted to Shae’s office. The pretense of the meeting was\nto give her an update on the goings-on in the Royal Council during her absence, particularly the\nnational budget, and the question over what Kekon’s stance ought to be regarding refugees from the\nOortokon War, which had been going on for nearly a year. Shae knew the true reason for their visit.\nThey had taken a risk by going to Hilo to advocate her removal as Weather Man. Now that it was\nclear they had failed and she was to remain in her post, they were here to forestall disfavor.\n“Kaul-jen,” Councilman Kowi said, saluting deeply and nervously. “I speak for all of us in\nexpressing how relieved we are to see you well.” The two Lantern Men echoed his sentiments\nvehemently.

At last, Kowi cleared his throat. “Kaul-jen, my family’s ties to No Peak go back\ngenerations, so it goes without saying that my allegiance to the clan is ironclad and I personally hope\nto be working with you for many years.”\nMr. Eho, the Lantern Man, said, “In this day and age, the news cycle moves faster than ever, and\nthings are printed in the newspapers or spoken on the radio before the truth is even verified. I’m\nashamed to say that perhaps I jumped to conclusions based on some of the recent negative talk, but I\nshould never have lost faith in the clan and in the Weather Man’s office.”\n“I’d be willing to publicly declare my regrets to the Pillar for any misunderstanding,” said Mr.\nOrn contritely and earnestly, though his pained expression suggested obvious reluctance. A missing\near would not look good on someone hoping to run for political office.\nShae let a silence come to rest in the room, for long enough that she could Perceive the anxiety\nof her visitors rising. She looked at each of them in turn, her face impassive; none of the men met her\ngaze for more than a few seconds before glancing away. She crossed her legs and folded her hands\nover one knee. “That won’t be necessary,” she said. “My grandfather taught me that if a friend asks\nfor your forgiveness, you should always give it.” Her guests relaxed considerably, their shoulders\ncoming down, smiles beginning to appear on their faces.\nShae added, before any of them could begin to speak, “He also taught me that if you have to give\nit again, then they weren’t a friend to begin with.” She rose smoothly from her seat to end the\nmeeting. “I know I can count on your friendship and allegiance from now on.”\nShae spent the next few days getting caught up. On Fifthday morning, she called Hami Tumashon\ninto her office. “Hami-jen,” Shae said without preamble, “it’s time we talked about your future in the\nWeather Man’s office and in the No Peak clan.”\nHami’s expression turned stiff and wary, and his jade aura began to bristle defensively. Shae\nwent on, “We haven’t always seen eye to eye during the time I’ve been Weather Man. At times\nyou’ve challenged my decisions or made it clear that you felt I acted incorrectly.”\n“I’ve spoken up when I’ve thought it necessary,” Hami said brusquely. “I did the same when Yun\nDoru was Weather Man. He was too parochial, but the truth is that the clan was comfortable with him,\nbecause he was an old-timer, a comrade of the Torch. You don’t have that luxury. Even if I agree with\nthe general direction you’re taking the clan, I have to point it out when you act in ways that are ill\nconsidered or that cost respect for you and for No Peak.”\n“You’re right to do so,” Shae said. “As much as your honesty wounds my pride sometimes, I\nhave to admit you’re the one person in No Peak who best straddles the different sides of the clan. You\nhave the presence and cold instincts of a Fist but the brains and experience of a good Luckbringer."

You\nhave the presence and cold instincts of a Fist but the brains and experience of a good Luckbringer.\nYou see the need to change with the times but also the importance of staying true to our core as Green\nBones. That’s why I called you in here: I want you to move to Espenia, to start up a branch of the\nWeather Man’s office in Port Massy.”\nWhatever Hami had been expecting when he’d been called into Shae’s office, it was not this. As\nhe was too stunned to reply at first, Shae continued. “Despite current political sentiments, the reality\nis that we’re tied to Espenia economically. They buy our jade, have military bases on our soil, and\nnow our business interests in that country are growing more than ever. We can’t manage it all from\nJanloon. I need someone there. Someone who I know is loyal to the clan, who is adaptable to new\nways but will run the business like a true Kekonese.”\nHami was obviously still trying to process the idea. Cautiously, he said, “What support would I\nhave from Janloon?” He wanted to know if Shae was serious about expansion, or if this was simply a\nconvenient excuse to send him overseas and into functional exile.\n“As much as I can give you,” Shae said. “You would choose a handful of Luckbringers to help\nyou start the branch office. We have connections in Port Massy to help you hire additional staff\nlocally. You would report directly to me as you always have. The clan would pay for your family’s\nrelocation and living expenses. You have two children, don’t you, Hami-jen?”\nHami nodded. “They’re four and six years old.”\n“If you accept, I ask that you commit to the assignment for at least three years. Your children\nwould attend school in Port Massy and become fluent in Espenian, but still be young enough to attend\nKaul Du Academy when you return to Janloon.”\nShe could see Hami weighing her offer. As Master Luckbringer, the man was at the height of his\ncareer; there were few avenues for further advancement. No doubt he’d expected to stay in his role on\nShip Street for another decade or more. But he was still relatively young, only forty-one years old—\nthe idea of being paid to live abroad and start a whole new division of the clan’s operations was\nappealing. “My wife and I have talked about the idea of spending time overseas,” he admitted.\n“There’s something else for you to consider,” Shae said, knowing it might dissuade him but must\nbe addressed. “Civilian possession of jade is now illegal in Espenia. You would have to give up your\ngreen. You could store it safely here in Janloon, or we would find a way to make sure it’s covertly\ntransported to you in Port Massy, but you can’t wear it while you’re in that country. If you were only\ngoing to be there for a short while, we could obtain a visitor’s waiver, but you’ll be living there.\nWearing jade would expose you and the clan’s businesses to too much legal risk.”\nHami winced.

He’d left the military side of the clan a long time ago, and Shae doubted he’d been\ncalled upon to employ his jade abilities in a martial capacity for years, but the idea of losing one’s\njade was appalling to most Green Bones. Even though this would be a temporary measure of his own\nchoosing instead of a permanent loss brought about by an enemy, Shae could see him questioning\nwhether he could stand to live in a place where he couldn’t wear jade, no matter how good the pay,\nthe professional challenge, and the family enrichment.\nHami looked to her. “You’ve taken off your jade before. How bad was it?”\nShae considered the question before answering honestly. Her own recent symptoms had abated\nconsiderably, but the memory was fresh. “Withdrawal isn’t pleasant, but it’s not as bad as most people\nthink,” she said. “You’d go through it here at home, under medical supervision, so it would probably\nbe over in a couple of weeks. Being without jade is different when you’re in Espenia. I’d never ask\nfor such a thing from any Green Bone in Kekon, but over there, when you don’t see green anymore,\nafter a while you stop missing it altogether.”\n“Like being deaf in a country of deaf people.” The Master Luckbringer mulled the idea for a\nminute. “I can’t make such an important decision right away. I need to talk to my family.”\nShe nodded. “Give me your answer by next Fifthday.”\nShae left the office an hour after lunch and took a thirty-minute subway ride to meet Maro on the\ncampus of Jan Royal University. She brought a book to read along the way but couldn’t focus on any\nof the words. She’d been longing terribly to see Maro again, but she dreaded the conversation to\ncome. When she’d finally mustered the courage to call him, part of her had hoped that Maro would\nhang up the second he heard her voice and make it easy on her. No such luck; there’d been several\nheartbeats of silence from the other end of the line, and then he’d said, in a voice with no emotion she\ncould read, “I can meet you after my last class finishes today.”\n“I’ll come to where you are,” Shae offered, as if, ridiculously, this small consideration on her\npart could compensate for the weeks she’d been out of contact.\nAt the height of summer, the city subway was humid and odorous, but the campus was\npleasantly green and generously shaded. Shae spotted Maro sitting at an outdoor table behind the\nForeign Studies Department building’s cafeteria. His back was to her. He had a book open on the\ntable but wasn’t reading it; the pages lay undisturbed in the hot, still air. Shae felt a powerful desire to\nwalk up and put her arms around Maro’s shoulders, to pretend that nothing had happened, that\neverything was the same as before. And yet in the same moment, the idea struck her as impossible,\nawkward, inappropriate, like draping her arms over a stranger. The ease she felt around him—the\nescape and acceptance he represented, that she realized she’d made of him—that feeling was gone.\nShe could sense it even from this distance."

Maro took her in:\ndressed in her usual business attire, ugly new scars hidden, her throat bare and pale where her\ndistinctive jade choker used to be. A strange expression crossed his face—a mixture of hurt\nconfusion, affection, anger, and relief that seemed to twitch his features in several indecisive\ndirections before he forced it into a cautiously neutral smile. The smile of someone trying to be civil\nto another driver who’s smashed into their car. “I’m glad you’re okay,” he said slowly. “And I’m glad\nyou came to see me.”\n“I’m sorry,” Shae said. It seemed to be the only way to start.\n“Why?” The single word came out strained, but there were so many things that it could be\nreferring to that Shae was not sure how to answer. Maro lowered his voice. “Why wouldn’t you return\nany of my calls? Before, or after, you did it?” For a second, Shae was struck by uncertainty—did he\nmean the abortion, or the duel? But he didn’t know about the former, so it was the duel. “Why did\nyou make me find out about it from the news? Why wouldn’t you even talk to me?”\n“I’m sorry,” Shae repeated. “A lot of things happened quickly. I knew that if I talked to you, I’d\nlose my nerve and not be able to do what I had to.”\n“What you had to?” Maro asked, skepticism strangling each of his words. “You had to volunteer\nfor a dramatic public death?”\n“I was being discredited and forced out, Maro. The Mountain was using me to undermine and\nweaken No Peak.” She’d promised herself she would not give in to defensiveness, but she heard it\ncreeping into her voice anyway. “I had to put a stop to it. On the phone, you reminded me that I\ndeserved my position. You told me not to give in.”\nMaro shook his head. “A duel wasn’t what I had in mind! You could’ve been killed.”\nShae said, “Yes, but I wasn’t. I’m still here. Still the Weather Man.”\n“But if you had been killed—and you almost were—you wouldn’t even have spoken to me\nbeforehand. That’s…” Disbelief and anger contorted his expression. “That’s not how it’s supposed to\nwork between people who care about each other. How could you not even talk to me about it?”\n“What would you have said?” Shae asked. “Would you have supported my decision? Or would\nyou have told me not to risk my life? To avoid the duel by not showing up?”\nShe regretted her words almost at once. Maro’s eyes widened, and then his face crumpled softly.\n“Yes,” he said. “I suppose that’s exactly what I would’ve said. I would’ve told you that you’re above\nthat kind of thing, above using violence to prove yourself. No matter the public pressures, I would’ve\nreminded you of what you once said to me: that it’s brave to be true to who you are.”\nShae said quietly, “This is who I am.”"

I\ntried to warn you that there’re things about the clan and about me that you wouldn’t agree with.”\n“Whether I agree with them or not, you shouldn’t have kept me in the dark like that!” Maro’s\nvoice rose and he forced it down again, with effort. “You’re right—maybe there are things in your life\nand your family that I’m never going to be able to accept. I’ve thought about them, before—how\ncouldn’t I? I wondered if I would have to join the clan to be able to marry you, how we’d ever raise a\nfamily with the demands on you as Weather Man, whether my Shotarian family would ever be able to\nmeet yours… there were so many things that I knew we would have to talk about, but I always\nassumed we would talk about them. We’d be truthful with each other about the challenges, and we’d\nget through them together.” He searched her face with pained eyes. “That’s the only way I want a\nrelationship with you—if we’re completely honest with each other. I know you can’t tell me\neverything that you do as Weather Man. I can live with that, but things that affect your safety, our\nlives… I deserve that much, at least. Can you promise not to keep important things from me?”\nShae was lacking enough moisture in her throat. She certainly couldn’t tell Maro about the\nabortion, not now, not with him already hurt. What else might she have to do in the future that she\nwouldn’t be able to explain? “In the last few years, I’ve done things I never thought I would,” she\nadmitted hoarsely. “I’m not sure what I can promise anymore.”\nMaro’s silence lasted for an interminable minute. It seemed to Shae that he was receding from\nher, shrinking to the end of a tunnel. Maro drew his hand back to his side of the table and looked\naway, across the green lawn of the campus, the line of his bearded jaw flexing. “I don’t know where\nthis leaves us, then.”\nShae managed to say, “As friends, for now. If that’s something you’ll still accept from me.”\nMaro closed the book on the table, one finger tucked between the pages to hold his place as he\nstood up. His lips formed the shape of a weak smile, but one entirely without cheer. “Of course. Who\nin all of Kekon would be unwise enough to refuse the friendship of the No Peak clan?”\nCHAPTER\n33\nNot a Safe Place\nD\nuring his second year in Port Massy, Anden took a part-time job at a hardware store, stocking"

        "text": "CHAPTER\n33\nNot a Safe Place\nD\nuring his second year in Port Massy, Anden took a part-time job at a hardware store, stocking\nshelves, manning the cash register, assisting customers with home improvement projects. He still had\nhis usual course load to manage, but he wanted to earn some extra money. He could help out the\nHians with some of their monthly expenses, save some cash for the future, and have a little extra to\nspend. Financially, he’d relied on the Kaul family all his life; now that his prospects in the clan\nseemed so low, he felt as if he ought to be better prepared to pay his own way through life. Also, he\nwould rather be doing something besides studying. Working at Starr Lumber & Supply would\nimprove his ability to speak Espenian, so in truth, it could be considered part of his education. He\ncould now navigate public transit and read signs and hold conversations with strangers. It was\nsatisfying to feel self-reliant. Anden had never understood why, years ago, his cousin Shae had gone\nabroad and distanced herself from the clan; now he thought he had a better idea.\nHe’d continued meeting up with Cory Dauk and his relayball friends at the grudge hall all\nthroughout the winter and the dreary wet spring. When he first told Mr. and Mrs. Hian where he was\ngoing on Fifthday evenings, he was surprised that they didn’t seem to approve. He would’ve thought\nthey would be happy he was spending more time with friends in the neighborhood. Instead, Mrs. Hian\nsaid, in a tone that suggested Anden might be making a poor decision, “Anden-se, that place is not a\ngood influence on young people. So much violence. It gives people a bad impression of us.”\n“I have great respect for the Dauks,” Mr. Hian put in, sliding Anden a gaze of paternal concern,\n“but the grudge hall… I wouldn’t spend time there myself. The cockfighting and gambling and\ndueling—those things are against the law. What if the police raid the building and you’re caught\ndoing something illegal? You could have your student visa revoked.”\nIt occurred to Anden that if that happened, he would be deported back to Kekon immediately and\nHilo would have no choice but to take him back in. He didn’t voice this flash of wry optimism to the\nHians. Instead, he promised them that he would never engage in gambling or dueling of any kind.\n“But there are always a lot of Green Bones there,” said Mrs. Hian, persisting in her concern. “It’s\nnot safe.”\nIn Janloon, it was common knowledge that the safest places to be were those frequented by\nGreen Bones. Excepting unusual circumstances of clan war, there were few spots less prone to trouble\nthan establishments like the Twice Lucky restaurant or the Lilac Divine Gentleman’s Club. So Mrs.\nHian’s worries made no sense to Anden until he remembered that the proposed law Dauk Losun had\nspoken of last summer had been passed by the National Assembly and jade itself was now another\nthing that was illegal in Espenia.\nHe often forgot this fact.

        "text": "He often forgot this fact. He could accept that a great many things were different in Espenia than\nthey were in Kekon, but the idea of banning jade was as hard for Anden to imagine as forbidding the\nuse of cars or money—of course, not everyone could or should have those things because they were\ndangerous in the wrong hands, but trying to do away with them altogether would be ridiculous. How\nwould society function?\nAnden reminded himself that he was reacting with a narrow Kekonese mind-set. Other places in\nthe world had gotten by for thousands of years with no jade at all and so the availability of it now was\na new and harmful thing. The recent prohibition against civilian ownership and selling of jade had not\nchanged anything so far as Anden could tell; no Green Bone that he knew of was giving up his green\non account of it. All the new law did, Anden thought, was promote a negative view of Kekonese\npeople.\nMr. Hian was thinking of a different threat besides law enforcement, however. “The Crews have\nleft our neighborhood alone for a long time, but the Bosses—they see there’s gambling and\nmoneylending going on here that they don’t control. And jade.” Mr. Hian frowned deeply. “Dauk-jen\nsaid it wouldn’t be long before the understanding broke down. You don’t want to be caught in the\nmiddle if anything bad happens between Green Bones and Boss Kromner’s Crew.”\nThis rationale Anden could better understand. Civilians were always better off steering clear of\nconflicts that did not involve them. Seated in the Hians’ kitchen, he grew quiet and pensive. He didn’t\nwant to cause the Hians any worry on his account, but he couldn’t give up going to the grudge hall\nand meeting with Cory.\nSeeing this, the Hians relented. “You’re our guest, and we feel as responsible for your safety as\nif you were one of our own sons, but it’s not up to us to tell you what you can or can’t do; you’re a\ngrown man who can make his own decisions.” Mrs. Hian sighed. “You grew up with Green Bones, so\nnaturally you want to be back among them, and who are we to say no? We only want you to be\ncareful.” Anden gratefully promised them that he would be and that they needn’t worry.\nIt was not, in truth, that he wanted to be back among Green Bones, as Mrs. Hian had assumed.\nAlthough he enjoyed the food and drink, the displays of jade ability, and the generally convivial\natmosphere of the grudge hall (punctuated on occasion with the genuine and deadly serious settling of\ngrievances), it was, as he’d already learned on his first visit there, not really like Kekon at all. At best,\nit was something entirely different, at worst, an exaggerated facsimile of a working-class Kekonese\ntavern. If anything, it made him miss home more than ever. What he truly wanted came after his visits\nto the grudge hall, when Cory would offer to drive Anden back to the Hians’ but instead drove the\ntwo of them to his own apartment.\nCory did not own the place he lived in, which was a one-bedroom condo only ten minutes away"

        "text": "two of them to his own apartment.\nCory did not own the place he lived in, which was a one-bedroom condo only ten minutes away\nfrom his parents’ house. The Dauks kept it as an investment property and were planning to renovate it\nand put it back on the market once Cory went to law school in the fall. It was drafty, the furnace was\nnoisy, and the hot water heater badly needed replacing, but these were minor discomforts. Anden was\nforced to admit to himself, with some embarrassment, that he would probably follow Cory anywhere\nthe other man asked him.\nAfter that first time in the car, Anden had spent the entire following week thinking about his\nfriend, about the pale skin of Cory’s torso illuminated by streetlight, about his teasing eyes and quick\nsmile, his shapely hands and mouth. When the weather was still bad the following Fifthday, Cory\nphoned the Hians’ house to ask if Anden wanted to meet up at the grudge hall again, and Anden said\nyes. Afterward, he said yes to going to Cory’s apartment. And he said yes to everything else that Cory\nsuggested that night and on the other nights that followed.\nCory was the same in lovemaking as he was in everything else—spirited, good-humored, eager\nto please and easy to please in turn. For this, Anden was grateful because he felt acutely that he was\nthe opposite: torn between the nearly unbearable force of his awakening desire and the self-\nconsciousness of his own inexperience and nerves. Cory did not take himself too seriously in\nanything: He played music in the bedroom and danced in his underwear; he gave Anden gently\nteasing advice about what to do in bed; he admitted that when he was with men he preferred to be the\nreceiver, but he wasn’t insistent, suggesting they should be open-minded and figure out what Anden\nliked. When they were together, Anden could feel Cory’s jade almost as acutely as if he were wearing\nit himself; every sensation was heightened to an exquisite pitch. Cory’s aura was as light and sunny as\nhe was, like whipped cream or spring sunshine, gently sweet and addictive, as exciting and tangible to\nAnden as the sweat on his friend’s skin or the smell of his hair. Sometimes Anden wondered how\nmuch of his newfound appetite was for Cory himself and how much of it was the amplifying effect of\nthe other man’s jade, but the combination was utterly intoxicating.\nThey saw each other every week, and sometimes more than once a week, if they could manage\nto sneak away from their respective obligations. Anden, who’d never in his life skipped class or\nshowed up late for work, found himself cutting it close on a regular basis. Whenever his mind was\nidle, it drifted to thoughts of Cory, to erotic remembrances and anticipation of their next meeting,\nwhich was never soon enough, even if it was tomorrow, or in an hour.\nHe wondered if this was love.\nRelayball started up again with the spring. They’d lost a few players and gained a few others, but\nAnden was part of the regular group now; others wanted him on their team, said hello to him around\nthe neighborhood, showed friendly interest in him, and asked him questions about school or work or\nwhat it had been like growing up in Janloon.\nThen summer arrived, and Cory got ready to leave on his long-anticipated travels, which would"

The idea of six weeks alone with Cory was appealing in the extreme.\nBut he was already registered to continue with the IESOL program through the summer, he didn’t\nhave either the funds or the days off from work, and he wasn’t about to abuse the generosity of either\nthe Hians or his cousins by asking them for money. Also, he imagined the Dauks would suspect his\nreasons for suddenly wanting to leave behind his obligations and travel alone with their son.\n“What would your parents think, if they knew about us?” Anden asked.\nCory made a face. “What does it matter what my parents think?” In Kekon, queerness was\nconsidered a natural, if unfortunate permanent condition afflicting unlucky families, not unlike stone-\neyes and children with birth defects. Cory explained that in Espenia it was commonly thought of as a\nsign of weak character, similar to addiction and indebtedness—a situation that some susceptible\npeople were predisposed to fall into if not careful, but might recover from. “Bad luck can be turned\naround,” was Cory’s wry assessment of the prevailing attitude among Keko-Espenians. “Look,\ncrumb,” he explained to Anden, “I know my da. He’s a traditionalist from the island, like you. What\nhe cares about is that his son wears jade. He’ll let me get away with just about anything else, but\nwearing jade, being true to our roots—that’s an absolute must for him. I suspect at some point, my ma\nwill start making noises about me getting married and having kids, but come on, I’m twenty-four!\nPlenty of time to think about that later.”\nThe summer days were long and hot and smelled of dock fumes and piss. Seagulls wheeled in\nthe sky and left shit on lawns. Tourists crowded the transit system. The streets swelled with traffic and\nstreet vendors, petty crime and road construction. Port Massy was an expansive world-class city in a\nleague above even a burgeoning metropolis like Janloon; after living in it for sixteen months, Anden\nstill felt as if the place completely defied familiarity. At times, it seemed to him that the sheer size and\ncultural scope of Port Massy only made his life shrink, made him want to take refuge in the routines\nand people he felt he could trust.\nThe Fifthday evening before Cory’s departure, they played relayball as usual in the high school\nfield. Anden was keenly aware of his friend’s presence at all times. He felt as if he were a small planet\ncaught in the gravity of a star, circling at a helpless distance from its radiance. He watched Cory\nscramble and leap for passes, laugh and joke, push his hair out of his eyes, and perform the silly\ndance he did when he put the ball between the point posts. Anden fumbled the next pass and the ball\nflew into the net. He cursed under his breath."

He cursed under his breath.\nWhen they went to the grudge hall afterward, Sano, the doorman, clapped Cory on the back and\nsaid, “Last we’ll see of you for a while, heh? Travel safe, and don’t forget about us in Southtrap when\nyou’re a big shot attorney.” Downstairs, Cory’s friends had pushed several tables together. Derek’s\nmother had baked a cherry spice cake, and people were signing messages in a notebook for Cory to\ntake with him. Anden had no idea what to write in the book, so when it was his turn, he wrote, in\ncareful Espenian: Thank you for your friendship this year. You made me feel at home in Port Massy.\nGood luck in law school! and then felt wretched about it. He turned to look for Cory again and saw\nhim with his arm thrown over Derek’s shoulder, laughing uproariously at something Sammy had said.\nJealousy stabbed into Anden like a talon knife to the gut. At Watersguard, Cory would be immersed in\nnew experiences and surrounded by new friends, confident young fellow Espenians. Anden turned\naway and took a piece of cake.\nThere were no duels in the grudge hall tonight, merely the usual entertainments. Dauk Losun and\nDauk Sana were nowhere to be seen, perhaps so Cory could enjoy one of his last nights in Port Massy\naway from the watch of his parents, but Rohn Toro was present, sitting by himself at a small table by\nthe door, quietly enjoying a drink and nodding to people who touched their foreheads in silent salute\nas they passed him.\n“Did you hear about Tim Joro?” Anden overheard a man nearby talking to two others. “Died\nfrom a sudden heart attack. Only fifty-four years old. He was always drinking and getting in trouble\nwith the law, though, so I guess I’m not surprised.”\n“What about his poor wife?” asked a woman.\n“Moved back in with her parents.” The conversation continued in more hushed tones. Anden\nglanced again at Rohn. Occasionally, someone would slide deferentially into the empty chair opposite\nthe man and lean forward to speak to him quietly. Rohn’s expression rarely changed; he would nod a\nlittle or ask a question, but he maintained the serenely impassive look of an animal at rest, alert even\nin its own lair. The people who came to speak to him did not linger or make social talk; they left so\nthat others could come in their turn. Something about the understated gravity in these small\ninteractions made Anden think of home, of the safety he’d always felt and taken for granted in No\nPeak territory.\nCory came up behind him and grabbed him in a bear hug around the shoulders. “Hey, crumb, it’s\ntoppers in here tonight,” Cory said, letting go innocently. “You doing all right? Have you tried the\ncake? You want another drink?”\nAnden turned around, forcing a smile onto his face. “No, I’m fine. It’s a great party.” His voice\nfell. “I’m happy for you. I’m just… wishing Adamont Capita wasn’t so far away.”"

I’m just… wishing Adamont Capita wasn’t so far away.”\n“I told you, it’s only a three-hour bus ride, crumb,” Cory exclaimed. “It’ll be easy for me to\ncome home to visit.” Anden didn’t feel comforted by this, but Cory said, “Come on, gang along with\nthe rest of us.” He led Anden back to the cluster of their usual relayball friends and cheerfully\nannounced, “Hey, did you all know Anden’s an uncle now?”\nAbashed by the attention but proud nonetheless, Anden produced the wallet-sized photographs\nthat Shae had sent him. One was of Niko sitting on the floor of the kitchen in the Kaul house wearing\na green T-shirt and blue shorts, holding a plastic toy talon knife in one hand and a half-eaten cracker\nin the other. He was holding the cracker out, as if offering it to the photographer, probably Wen. The\ncamera appeared to have caught him by surprise—he stared out of the photo with a slightly\nbewildered expression, crumbs on his chin, one eye squinted in a way that made him look so similar\nto Lan that it was sometimes painful for Anden to look at the picture.\nHe’d been astonished to learn of Niko’s existence. Every time he thought about this boy he’d\nnever met, he felt a deep pang of sympathy. Niko was an orphan too, brought into the Kaul home in\nthe wake of tragedy (his mother and stepfather were killed in a terrible house fire, Shae had\nexplained). No doubt he’d felt as lost and confused as Anden had been. If only there was some way\nhe could reassure Niko, tell him not to worry, because unlike Anden, he was a Kaul in both blood and\nname.\nThe second photograph was of baby Ru, eight weeks old, though he must be nearly eight months\nby now. Anden had asked for more recent photographs in his last letter, but it took so long to get\nthem, and he was not about to bother the Weather Man over such a small thing. Ru was cherubic and\nhad a lot of dark hair; he held one pudgy fist cocked by his head and the other extended, as if in a\nfighting pose. It made Anden smile. His friends in the grudge hall exclaimed appreciatively over the\nphotographs and handed them back. “They’re so cute!” exclaimed Tami, the flirtatious young woman\nwho Anden had learned was studying at Port Massy College to be a dental technician.\nDerek said, “Are you going to share your own news, Tod?”\nTod looked around the circle and squared his shoulders. “I enlisted yesterday.”\nA brief silence followed this announcement. Cory said, “Good for you, Tod.” Sammy said,\n“Yeah, that’s toppers.”\nTami’s friend, Ema, asked, with a touch of concern, “What do your parents think?”\n“My ma’s worried about me being deployed in Oortoko, but she supports me. My da’s against it,\nsays it’s a betrayal for me to fight on the side of the Shotarians after what they did to Kekon and to\nour family.” Most Kekonese-Espenians came from families who’d fled the Shotarian occupation of\ntheir parents’ and grandparents’ generation.

Many had distant relatives who’d been part of the One\nMountain Society, who’d been tortured or executed.\n“I don’t see it that way at all,” Tod said, a little angrily. “The occupation was thirty years ago,\nand besides, I wouldn’t be fighting for the Shotarians, I’d be fighting for Espenia, to keep the ’guts\nfrom thinking they can take over the world. The recruiter I’ve been talking to said that they’re really\ninterested in getting more kespies like us to enlist.”\n“I’ve been thinking about it too,” Sammy admitted.\n“It’s the only legal way to wear jade now,” Tod pointed out. “And if the immigration records\nshow that at least one of your parents came from Kekon, you’ll be put on the fast track to special\nforces. If you make it in, you’ll get a medical exemption: low or no SN1 dosing, no three-year\nrestriction. And you won’t be prosecuted for having worn jade prior to your service.”\n“You won’t be able to wear any of your own jade, though,” Cory pointed out. “I’ve heard they\nstart everyone at square one. Even if you already have training in some of the traditional disciplines,\nthey want to build you up their own way.”\nTod stuffed his hands into his pockets and said, “I think it’s worth it. I’d like it if people saw us\nas patriots, you know? If they realized that jade can be used for good, to serve Espenia.”\nThose two things, Anden might’ve pointed out, were not the same at all, but he held his tongue.\nThis was the most bewildering conversation he’d heard during his time in Port Massy. A Green Bone\nserving the government that banned his jade? Willingly leaving his home to fight in a faraway country\nfor people to whom he owed nothing, in a way that was almost certain to kill jadeless civilians and\nbreak aisho? It was astonishingly un-Kekonese.\nAnden knew, from discussion at the Hians’ dinner table and from the Kekonese-language\nnewspaper that they subscribed to, that Kekon was hosting more than a hundred thousand ROE\nsoldiers on Euman Island and providing economic and logistical support to the war effort, and still the\nEspenian government was pressuring the Royal Council for more. The Kekonese were\nunderstandably angry. Shae had been vilified for her former military ties to Espenia and been forced\nto defend her reputation in a near lethal clean-bladed duel against Ayt Mada—something Anden could\nbarely imagine and felt a little sick even thinking about. The foreigners and their war were causing\nnothing but trouble for his cousins in No Peak.\nAnden was sad to admit he’d lost some respect for Tod.\nCory apparently did not feel the same way. “I think it’s toppers what you’re doing, Tod. I hope\nthat—” He didn’t finish because a sudden motion caught his attention. Rohn Toro had leapt to his feet\nand was standing stock-still, his eyes unfocused in the way that Anden knew to be the expression of a\nGreen Bone concentrating intensely on something in his Perception.

A muted burst of rattling noise,\nlike the popping of a dozen firecrackers, came from the street above. Gunfire.\nRohn tore up the stairs like a demon. A wave of confusion, then worry, then fear swept through\nthe enclosed space of the underground grudge hall. Several people began to scramble for the stairs\ntoward escape, but Cory reacted, just as he had when Tim Joro’s wife had run out into the lanes of\nspeeding traffic. “Don’t go up there!” he shouted, in an urgent and commanding voice that Anden had\nnever heard him use before. “Stay here, everyone.” He looked to Tod and Sammy. “Green Bones will\ngo first. Don’t come out until one of us says it’s safe.”\nThree men and a woman—Anden had seen them in the grudge hall before but didn’t remember\ntheir names—rose from their seats and joined Cory, Tod, and Sammy as they ran for the stairs. Most\nof the people nearby moved aside to let them pass, but a few still tried to follow or push ahead of\nthem. Protesting voices started to rise. At the foot of the stairs, Tod spun around and threw a wide,\nshallow Deflection that swept through the hall, knocking off hats and upending drink glasses. “Stay\nhere, we said!” The Green Bones raced up the stairs.\nAnden stood rooted to the spot for a second. Then he ran after them. He couldn’t say why he did\nso; he wasn’t a Green Bone, and he wasn’t armed with anything except a compact talon knife. He\ndidn’t think about any of that. The only thing on his mind was the fact that Cory was disappearing up\nthe stairs without him.\n“Hey, islander, where are you going? They said to stay put!” Derek shouted after Anden, but\nneither he nor anyone else moved to actually stop him. On the main floor, Anden saw Mrs. Joek and\nthe other food vendors crouched underneath their tables in fear. Rohn Toro was nowhere in sight.\nAnden caught up to Cory, who turned, eyes widening with astonishment and alarm. “What are you\ndoing?” he hissed. “Go back downstairs with everyone else!”\nA muffled, agonized groan came from behind the metal doors. “Sano,” Tod said. He ran to the\nentrance and threw it open. The large doorman was slumped against the brick wall, gurgling, bleeding\nfrom a profusion of bullet wounds. Tod fell to the man’s side. “Oh shit. Shit.” One of the other men\nran to help Tod pull Sano inside. A slick red river trailed after them across the concrete floor. “If only\nmy ma was here, maybe she could do something…” Cory’s voice was trembling. “Can anyone else do\nmedical Channeling?” The others shook their heads, panic on their faces. Anden’s hands closed\nhelplessly; in the Academy, he’d learned the basics of Channeling for first aid, but it was no good to\nhim now. Tod tried anyway, but Anden could see it was already too late; there was too much blood\nloss and the light was already going from Sano’s eyes. Mrs. Joek began to crawl out from under her"

Mrs. Joek began to crawl out from under her\ntable, muffling sobs in the crook of her elbow. “No, stay there,” Cory ordered her.\n“Let’s check the front,” Sammy suggested. His voice was a hoarse whisper. “Where the fuck is\nRohn?” They hurried to the unmarked interior double doors that led into the front of the building, the\ncommunity center proper. Anden followed, even though Cory shouted at him again over his shoulder\nto stay behind. The community center was dark, the tables, chairs, and bookshelves discernible as\nshadowy outlines. The front windows of the building had been blown out by gunfire; shards of glass\nglittered on the carpet and the streetlight illuminated the bullet holes in the door and walls. A figure\nstood in front of the building, looking out at the street, framed by the jagged outline of the shattered\nwindow. The air from a nearby grate billowed Rohn’s coat; otherwise, he was as still as a lamppost.\n“Rohn-jen,” Cory said as they came up cautiously behind the man, staring at the damage. Rohn\nheld up a black-gloved hand to stop them. “They’re coming back for another pass.” Three cars\nbarreled around the corner, engines roaring. A second later, machine gun fire clattered to life.\nCory fell upon Anden and dragged him to the ground as Rohn, Tod, Sammy, and the other Green\nBones threw overlapping Deflections that sent the bullets veering into walls and furniture, into the\nceiling where they shattered the lights, and into the floor where they gouged chunks out of the carpet.\nAnden hit the ground with his shoulder. He heard someone else let out a shout, of anger or pain. “Stay\ndown!” Cory ordered, then his weight was gone as he leapt up to try and help the others.\nSeveral items came flying through the broken windows and tumbled across the carpet. Anden,\nstill on the floor, blinked at the red flame that rolled toward him: a lit rag, stuffed into the neck of a\nglass bottle full of liquid. In seconds, Anden realized, the flame would reach the gasoline and the\nhomemade explosives would go off and light the building on fire.\nAnden lunged forward and grabbed the bottle. He felt a sharp jab in the knee as a piece of glass\ncut into his skin. Scrambling to his feet, he ran for the broken window. He hefted the bomb to hurl it\nback out into the street. The burning fabric fell across the back of his hand and he cried out in pain.\nHis throw fell short; it spun end over end toward the sidewalk.\nA gloved, speed-blurred hand snatched the burning object out of the air like an intercepted\nrelayball pass. In a burst of Strength and Lightness, Rohn Toro flew toward the black cars as they fled\ndown the street, showing their taillights. Rohn heaved the lit bottle; it sailed like a missile over the top\nof the rear car, breaking on the hood and igniting in a small wall of fire as gasoline sprayed the\nwindshield.

The car swerved and its front right tire ran up onto the curb of the sidewalk. The grill\nstruck a fire hydrant with a crunch of metal. The front doors flew open and two men stumbled out of\nthe car.\nRohn strode up, drawing a revolver from the inside pocket of his jacket. He put two bullets in the\nchest of the driver. The other man swung up the Fullerton submachine gun he’d used to pepper the\nbuilding. Rohn shoved him back hard with a left-handed Deflection; the shooter was thrown against\nthe open door of the black car. Rohn shot him in the head. The man slumped to the asphalt, and Rohn\nput another bullet in his face. Rohn looked down the street; the other two cars were gone.\nAnden turned around, clutching his hand, trying to see through the spots of red in his vision and\nthe grit on his glasses. Cory had grabbed one of the other explosives and yanked out the rag; with\nSteeled hands he was snuffing out the flame, grimacing with pain and intense concentration as he\nsuffocated the fire between his palms. One of the other Green Bones was disarming another unbroken\nbottle in the same way, but the others were desperately battling fires. One bomb had shattered against\nthe concrete wall outside and was burning itself out, but another had broken against a table inside and\nlit the carpet on fire. One more had rolled into the room with the Deitist shrine and exploded; a fire\nraged in front of the replicated mural, igniting the frayed kneeling cushions.\nAnden grabbed the nearest thing he could find—a wooly blue area rug from the daycare center—\nand threw it over the fire in the shrine, stomping it out with his shoes. The woman Green Bone ran\ninto the room with a kitchen fire extinguisher, and after fumbling with the thing for a moment,\nsprayed foam over the remaining flames. She ran back out to help Tod and Sammy, who were dousing\nthe other fire with buckets of water. In a few minutes, the community center was dark again. Anden\nstaggered back into the main room. The faces around him were streaked with sweat and some were\nbleeding from glass cuts; hair and clothes and hands were singed. “Seer’s balls,” Tod gasped, bent\nover with his hands on his knees. “Those were crewboys—Kromner’s people. Those fuckers.”\nRohn Toro stepped back through the broken window as the sound of sirens rose distantly.\n“Anyone with jade needs to leave now before the police arrive,” Rohn said. “Split up and lie low for a\nwhile. Don’t talk to any cops; you don’t know anything about what happened here. I’ll call and leave\nmessages when it’s safe.”\n“All the people still downstairs in the grudge hall—we need to get them out,” Cory said.\n“I’ll take care of that,” Rohn said. He turned to Anden. “You stay and help.”\nAnden nodded dumbly, though he had no idea why Rohn thought he would be useful. Cory\nprotested, “Don’t pull Anden into this; he shouldn’t even be here.”\n“He already is,” Rohn said. “I’ll take him back to the Hians’ house afterward.” The sirens"

The Pillar’s son gave Anden a distressed look, then turned to the others. “Okay,\nyou heard Rohn-jen.”\nThe six Green Bones left in a hurry, parting ways on the sidewalk and disappearing down\ndifferent streets. Rohn turned to Anden. “I need time to get everyone out the back of the building\nbefore the police have a chance to detain and question them. The cops who show up might not be as\neasy to handle as the ones we regularly see; if they get a chance, they might harass and threaten\npeople into pointing out who in the neighborhood’s a Green Bone, maybe even point to the Dauk\nfamily.” Rohn’s eyes raked over Anden’s face. “I need someone to go out front and delay the police\nfor a while. Can you do that?”\nAnden said, “I’ll do it, Rohn-jen.”\nRohn nodded and clapped him once on the shoulder with a gloved hand. Anden felt the\nmomentary pressure of the man’s jade aura, then Rohn strode back through the wreckage.\nAnden went out to the front of the building and ran down the block toward the sound of the\napproaching sirens. When he saw the red-and-blue pulse of the squad car’s lights, he stepped off the\ncurb and waved his arms urgently. The vehicle came to a stop in front of him. Anden brought a hand\nup to shield against the glare of the headlights as the door opened and a middle-aged policeman\nstepped out. He had a thick mustache and squinty eyes—not one of the cops Anden had seen collect\nfrom the grudge hall before. “What seems to be the problem here?” the officer demanded. “Were you\nthe one who called in a report of gunfire in the area?”\nAnden had no idea who had called but he nodded at once. He understood why Rohn had given\nhim this task. Anden wore no incriminating jade and looked Espenian. He could pose as a concerned\nnon-Kekonese bystander, not anyone that might be connected to the grudge hall and to the Dauks in\nany way.\nOut of spontaneous inspiration, Anden spoke with a mild Stepenish accent. “I saw three cars\nracing up and down the street.” He had never been to Stepenland and did not speak a word of the\nlanguage, but a few of his classmates in the IESOL program were Stepenish. A Stepenish accent was\ndistinctly recognizable and easy to affect, and as Anden’s Espenian had greatly improved but was not\nperfect, it would serve to hide the only obvious indication that he was Kekonese. “They were going\ntoo fast, and the people inside were waving guns and shooting out the windows.”\n“Typical bloody Southtrap goons,” the police officer grumbled. “Did you see which direction\nthey went?”"

About five\nminutes ago.”\nThe officer nodded in thanks, got back into his squad car, and drove in the direction Anden had\nindicated. Anden doubted he would be misled for long. In short order, he would discover the bodies\nof the dead men, the burned car, the bullet casings in the street and the shattered windows of the\ncommunity center. But Anden had done as Rohn had asked: He’d bought time.\nAnden waited until he was sure the squad car was gone and there were no others on the way.\nGlancing around to ensure he was truly alone and unwatched, he walked quickly, but not too quickly,\nback toward the community center, circling around the building to the grudge hall entrance at the\nback. Rohn Toro was closing the metal door. He was alone, and all the cars in the lot were gone. It\nappeared as if he’d succeeded in clearing out the building and sending everyone home. “I sent the\npoliceman toward Fifty-Fourth Street,” Anden said as he hurried up to the man. He looked down at\nthe puddle of blood next to the grudge hall door. “What about Sano?”\nRohn said, “Mrs. Joek took him to the hospital. It was too late, though.”\nAnden muttered, “Let the gods recognize him.”\n“My da used to say that. But I don’t think there are gods in Espenia. Not our gods, anyway.”\nRohn began walking purposefully away from the building, crossing the parking lot and entering one\nof the nearby alleys. Anden followed. The sound of another siren rose up—perhaps the police officer\nhad circled back and discovered the bodies and the car by now.\nRohn Toro stopped and turned to the brick wall beside them. He felt around the surface with his\ngloved hands, then closed his fingers around a slightly protruding brick. He pulled and it came loose,\nrevealing a small, hollowed-out space. Carefully, the Horn took off his black leather gloves, folded\nthem neatly, almost reverently, and pushed them into the small crevice. He replaced the brick so that\nall that was visible was the slight unevenness between it and its neighbor.\nRohn grimaced and leaned heavily against the wall for several seconds, as if suddenly nauseous.\nAnden recognized the signs of discomfort for what they were: jade withdrawal. Rohn Toro’s jade was\nstitched into the lining of his leather gloves. When necessary, he could remove and hide them in a\nsecret location until he had occasion to return and retrieve them. If he was stopped and questioned by\nthe police later tonight, they could strip him naked and not find a bit of green on him.\nRohn straightened away from the wall. Hesitantly, Anden offered a hand to help the man; he had\nseen Rohn’s abilities tonight and knew it could not possibly be easy to live as a Green Bone in this\nway, putting on and taking off so much jade at an instant. Rohn was not young either, perhaps fifty\nalready—how could his body handle it? But the Horn was steady now; he gazed at Anden and his"

But the Horn was steady now; he gazed at Anden and his\nmouth moved with wry embarrassment, as if the younger man had witnessed him in a moment of\nvulnerability, fly open and pissing against the wall.\nThey continued down the unlit alleyway.\nCHAPTER\n34\nThe Clan’s Friendship\nT\nhe two months following the attack on the grudge hall were the worst that Anden had spent in\nEspenia, even worse than when he’d first arrived and been bereft with homesickness. Cory was gone;\nhe’d called from the train station to say goodbye. He explained that he’d wanted to come over to see\nAnden in person, but it was too risky; not only were Kromner’s crewboys still about, the police had\nbegun randomly stopping Kekonese residents on the street and searching them for jade. The Dauks\nwere glad their son was getting out of the city.\n“I’m sorry I didn’t listen when you told me to stay downstairs,” Anden told Cory morosely over\nthe phone. “I just wanted to help.”\nCory was silent for a few seconds, then he sighed. “You know, I worry about you, islander. For a\nguy who seems so responsible, you sure do manage to get into trouble.” An announcement came over\nthe speakers at the train station, and Cory said, “I have to go, crumb. I’ll be back for Harvest’Eves\nbreak. Don’t do anything stupid while I’m gone, okay?”\nAfter they hung up, Anden was not only despondent at Cory’s departure, but troubled by their\nconversation. After leaving the grudge hall that night, he and Rohn had walked three blocks away\nfrom the scene of destruction before Rohn hailed a taxi and instructed it to take them to the Hians’\nhouse. Mr. and Mrs. Hian were relieved and dismayed when they opened the door. While Anden ran\nthe burn on the back of his hand under cold water at the kitchen sink, Rohn explained what had\nhappened.\n“Why did you have to get involved?” Mrs. Hian berated Anden as she rummaged bandages and a\ntube of antibiotic cream from the drawer. “You’re a visiting student, why didn’t you stay in the\nbasement with the others where it was safe? You should’ve let the Green Bones handle it. If you’d\nbeen hurt or killed, what would we tell your family?” She was near tears.\nAnden was mute with guilt, but Rohn said, “Don’t be so hard on him; he couldn’t help it. He’s\ngreen in the soul, like Dauk-jen said. In fact, he was a great help.” Rohn told them about how Anden\nhad diverted the police for long enough that Rohn could get all the people safely out of the grudge\nhall. The Hians reluctantly agreed that was indeed a good thing to have done. Rohn drank some hot\ntea and got up to leave, saying that he had to work the next morning. It was sometimes hard for\nAnden to remember that Rohn Toro was not actually a clan Fist, that he had to earn money in an\nordinary job, running a small moving company with a couple of friends."

        "text": "Anden to remember that Rohn Toro was not actually a clan Fist, that he had to earn money in an\nordinary job, running a small moving company with a couple of friends.\nAs soon as Rohn left, the Hians insisted, “Anden-se, what happened tonight is going to cause big\nproblems. Don’t go anywhere near the grudge hall or the Dauks’ house from now on; just go to school\nand work and back home again right away. If the police recognize you as the person who misled\nthem, they’ll want to question you.”\nAnden did as he was told, but over the next several days, he kept recalling Cory’s look of alarm\nthat night, the way he’d pulled Anden down to the ground away from machine gun fire, and how he’d\ngotten angry at Rohn and told him not to involve Anden at all: He shouldn’t even be here.\nThus far, Anden had thought of Cory as the leader in their relationship, himself as the follower.\nEspenia was Cory’s country, this was his city and his neighborhood; he was three years older than\nAnden; he was more socially gregarious and more sexually confident and experienced. None of this\nhad bothered Anden, had indeed made Cory only more attractive and alluring. But for the first time\nnow, Anden also saw himself as the weaker of the two of them. Mrs. Hian was right; Cory was a\nGreen Bone and Anden was not. When he’d rushed into danger, the Pillar’s son had been forced to\nprotect him. If their relationship lasted, would this always be the case?\nAnden was deeply troubled by the idea. He’d been born to a Green Bone family, adopted and\nraised by Green Bones, and trained at a Green Bone school. All his life he’d been taught to stand up\nnot only for his own honor and reputation, but that of his family and clan, and to defend those who\nwere weaker, those without jade who fell under the clan’s protection. Even as an exile from No Peak,\neven without jade, he hadn’t yet faced the reality that he was now one of those people who needed\ndefending. Everyone Anden had ever been close to, everyone important in his life, was a Green Bone.\nHe had no template for how to be a member of the Kaul family, indeed, how to be a Kekonese man at\nall, without jade. He had a sudden vision of Cory one day following in his father’s footsteps and\nbecoming the Pillar of Southtrap, with Anden relegated to being his secret lover, a vulnerable\nboyfriend who never fit into Espenia on his own terms, and the thought made Anden feel, for the first\ntime in nearly a year, a fresh pang of shame over his situation.\nIt didn’t help his mood that he’d lost the parts of his routine that he’d come to enjoy the most.\nRelayball was put on hiatus for two weeks following the incident, and afterward, he couldn’t muster\nthe enthusiasm to attend knowing that Cory wasn’t there. The grudge hall was indefinitely shut down;\nAnden snuck by the building once during the day and saw police tape crisscrossing the broken front\nentrance.\nThe Port Massy police questioned the residents of Southtrap but learned very little.

        "text": "entrance.\nThe Port Massy police questioned the residents of Southtrap but learned very little. No one\nclaimed to have been there at the time that the shooting happened. No one said anything about why\nthe community center had been targeted. That same night elsewhere in Southtrap, Kekonese\nbusinesses had been vandalized and walls were spray-painted with slurs, but no one pointed out the\nobvious to the police: that the crimes were racially motivated, that Kromner’s crewboys were\ntargeting the Kekonese for their gambling operations and jade.\nAnden heard rumors from Derek and Tami and a few others he managed to run into occasionally\non his way to and from school and work. Dauk had sent Rohn Toro with a few of his men to retaliate\nagainst Kromner’s Crew. Two bookmaking operations were attacked and robbed, and two crewboys\nsuspected of being among the drive-by shooters were found dead with broken necks. In response, the\nattacks on Kekonese businesses and civilians increased: The barbershop that Mr. Hian had been going\nto for eight years was set ablaze; an elderly Green Bone was ambushed and beaten outside of his\nhome and his few pieces of jade stolen; a local shopkeeper falsely suspected of being a Green Bone\nwas attacked at a bus stop. No arrests were made.\nThe Hians’ eldest son, a perpetually harried but well-meaning man in his early forties whom\nAnden had met over several polite but shallow interactions in the past, came over to the house to try\nto convince his parents to move out of the neighborhood and into the suburbs. Anden sat upstairs in\nhis bedroom trying not to eavesdrop, but there was no avoiding it.\n“Southtrap’s turning into an ethnic ghetto,” their son argued. “Wouldn’t you rather live\nsomewhere with more space and less crime?” But the Hians insisted that they did not want to move.\nThey liked the location, they had friends here; where else could they walk to a Kekonese grocery\nstore? Maybe, Mrs. Hian complained, if their sons were considerate enough to give them\ngrandchildren while they were still alive, they would have a reason to move; otherwise, what was the\npoint?\nDauk Losun called and asked if he and his wife might pay the Hians a visit one afternoon. He\nexplained that they would like to invite the Hians to their home, but the police knew that Sana was\nconnected to the grudge hall and suspected the couple was not telling the whole truth about the\nshooting and arson, so they were paying extra close attention to their part of the neighborhood. The\nDauks did not want to put Mr. and Mrs. Hian to any trouble, however, so they would bring something\nto eat. And could Anden please be there as well?\nThe Hians nervously agreed, although Mrs. Hian cooked a large amount of food anyway, so\nwhen the Dauks arrived with white plastic bags filled with half a dozen takeout dishes, there was far\ntoo much to eat. Extra chairs were brought into the Hians’ kitchen. Anden saluted the Dauks\nrespectfully, but he was on edge. Why had the Pillar asked to see him? Did it have something to do\nwith Cory? Did he know about them? Would he place the blame on Anden and forbid them from\nseeing each other?"

Have his law school\nclasses at Watersguard started yet?”\n“They started this week,” Dauk Sana said, passing out paper plates and plastic cutlery. “He\nsounds happy there, but that’s Coru—always free spirited. He hasn’t had to work hard yet, so we’ll\nsee. I’m just glad he’s safely away and busy.”\nAnden had forgotten that law school had already begun. Cory hadn’t phoned him from\nWatersguard, not yet. He was probably busy. Moving in, student orientation, new classes… Still. A\ncurl of hurt turned the food in Anden’s mouth tasteless.\nAs they ate, Dauk Losun asked, “How are you all doing? Has there been any trouble lately?” He\nlistened, nodding sympathetically, as Mrs. Hian talked about how the neighborhood wasn’t safe\nanymore and how their son wanted them to move away. Mr. Hian said, “Kromner’s thugs are hurting\ninnocent people and businesses, and the police do nothing.”\nDauk Sana said, “It’s because they’re paid by the Crews to look the other way. We have some of\nthe police in our pocket, it’s true, but they have more. At the end of the day, Kromner and his men are\nEspenians, and we are foreigners, so the police take their side. And so do people in general, because\nthey’re told by the news that Kekon is harming the war effort in Oortoko by hoarding all of the\nworld’s jade, even though that’s not true. Sometimes they even confuse us for Shotarians.”\nMrs. Hian cried, “What can be done, Dauk-jens, if the law won’t allow people to wear jade to\nprotect the community, but the police can’t be trusted? It is so unjust.”\nDauk Losun’s expression was grim. “I’m afraid this question has been keeping me awake at\nnight for months.”\n“It’s true,” his wife said. “He has to take anxiety pills.”\nAnden listened to all this with a growing sense of anger and disgust. In Janloon, the combatants\nin a clan war would not attack blameless civilians, not even if they were Abukei or foreigners. If\neither side started doing that, what was to stop a society from losing all sense of aisho and descending\ninto savagery? And the police! They had taken tribute from the grudge hall—Anden had seen it with\nhis own eyes—yet they did not protect it. Dauk Losun had likened the local law enforcement to\nanother clan, but they were not a clan at all, simply another predator, like the Crews. Meanwhile, it\nwas the Kekonese who were persecuted and treated like criminals simply for wearing jade to defend\nthemselves and manage their own affairs.\nDauk Losun’s heavy frame seemed to sag into the kitchen chair. In a resigned voice, he said,\n“I’ve been in this country for forty-five years. In truth, I’m almost Espenian. Maybe that’s why I"

But all these years, I also knew we could\nback up our words with force if needed, because we were the only ones with jade, and the only ones\nwho could use it.\n“But times have changed for the worse. With jade now illegal, the Crews no longer see the need\nto respect us. They know we can’t retaliate against them without making ourselves vulnerable to\nprosecution. The experienced Green Bones from the old country, the ones to really fear, like Rohn\nToro—they are few and aging, and the younger ones who were born here are not as well trained or\nserious. Look at my own son for example, as much as I love him. Or someone like Shun Todo, who\nhas talent in the jade disciplines but is too Espenian—he wants to leave home and join the military.”\nDauk shook his head. “I’m worried there’s no longer any way for us to stand up to tyrants like Blaise\nKromner. Rohn is the greenest man in this city, but he’s only one man. And I lie awake at night afraid\nthey’ll get to him; sooner or later, they’ll kill my good friend. It seems we have no choice but to agree\nto whatever terms the Bosses lay on us: paying their protection rackets, shutting down our grudge\nhall, letting their drug dealers and pimps into our neighborhood.”\nNo one was eating anymore. Mrs. Hian covered her mouth in distress and her husband put a\ncomforting hand on her back. Anden had been picking heartlessly at his meal, but now he noticed that\nthe Dauks were both looking at him. Slowly, Anden met the Pillar’s eyes. Dauk Losun continued\nspeaking to the Hians, but his gaze remained on Anden. “I’ve thought long and hard about the terrible\nsituation we’re in, and now I have to ask something of our young friend, Anden. And because you’re\nhis host family, I must ask it of you as well.”\nDauk Losun said to Anden, “You’re from the old country, and your family rules one of the most\nfamous and powerful Green Bone clans in Kekon. I still have friends on the island and rumors reach\neven across the Amaric Ocean, so I’ve known for a long time that you’re more than you say you are.\nYou and your cousins went to war against a stronger enemy that might’ve destroyed your clan, but\nyou prevailed.”\nWhen Anden had first met Dauk Losun, he’d thought him too homey and unimpressive a man to\nbe called Pillar. Now Dauk’s wrinkled eyes were steely and unwavering. Anden understood what was\nbeing asked of him; he recalled that he’d anticipated this since that first time he’d dined at the man’s\ntable and accepted his help.\nDauk said, “The Kaul family has far greater resources than we do. Jade, money, people, even\ninfluence over governments. Perhaps they have no reason to care about what happens here in Espenia,\nbut if there’s a chance they would offer their friendship in some way, it might help us now, when we\nhave nothing else to rely on.”"

How can you be sure they didn’t send you to Espenia for other reasons? They’re\nyour family, after all.”\nMrs. Hian stood up from the table and took the green ceramic teapot from the kitchen shelf, the\none that Anden had brought with him and given to his host family on behalf of the clan on the first\nday he’d arrived in Espenia—a token of the clan’s friendship, the promise of a favor to be returned.\nShe placed it in front of Anden, and said, “For the sake of the Kekonese community, Anden-se. If you\nhave any affection for us, as we have for you, we beg you to please try.”\nCHAPTER\n35\nStranger Allies\nA\nyear after the Republic of Espenia entered the Oortokon War, the secretary of international affairs\nmade his first visit to Kekon as part of an eight-country state tour. He was welcomed by a formal\nmilitary procession in front of Wisdom Hall, as well as a crowd of silent antiwar protestors and\nscathing editorial commentary from the Kekonese press. On the last day of his three-day visit, the\nsecretary held a closed-door meeting on Euman Island Naval Base with Chancellor Son Tomarho,\nselected members of his cabinet in the Royal Council, and the top leadership of No Peak. The\ngovernment of the ROE had learned over time that political power on Kekon was openly underwritten\nby the jade warrior class, and nothing in that small country was ever accomplished without the\nbacking of at least one of the major Green Bone clans.\nHilo tried to leave the dealings with politicians to Shae whenever he could get away with it, but\nhe couldn’t reasonably refuse a meeting with such a high-level Espenian diplomat without appearing\nto be deliberately insulting the ROE, something his Weather Man would counsel him against in no\nuncertain terms for a variety of reasons. Hilo, Shae, and Kehn were transported by private helicopter\nfrom Janloon to the airfield at Euman. When they arrived, they were met by the commanding officer,\nwho Shae recognized and introduced as Colonel Leland Deiller, and his executive officer, a man by\nthe name of Yancey, who escorted them across the grounds.\nAs they walked past a large training field, the low collective hum of unexpected jade auras\ncaught Hilo’s attention. Two lines of soldiers carrying heavy packs of gear faced a smooth ten-meter\nwall. At a signal from their instructor, the first line sprinted forward, turned their backs to the wall,\nand crouched in readiness. The second line raced toward their comrades, who boosted them into the\nair in one simultaneous heaving of jade-fueled Strength.

The heavily laden soldiers flew Light and\nhoisted themselves to the top of the wall—at least a majority of them did, a number did not make it\nand fell back to the ground. Those who succeeded turned around and used their own Strength to seize\ntheir fellows at the peak of their bounds and haul them up alongside.\nYancey noticed Hilo’s interest and explained, “Cadets of the Navy Angels, the most elite special\nops division in the ROE military. Only thirty percent of those recruits will make it through basic\nIBJCS training.” Yancey had to nearly shout to be heard over Euman’s stiff wind.\nAt Hilo’s questioning glance, Shae translated both the officer’s words and the unfamiliar\nacronym. Hilo had heard of the Integrated Bioenergetic Jade Combat System—the long and sterile\nterm the Espenians used to describe their version of the jade disciplines, adopted and modified from\nwhat they knew of Kekonese methods—but he had not actually seen it before. Kehn muttered, in a\nlow aside, “You’ve got to hand it to the Espenians. They know how to cook scraps into a meal.” A\nGreen Bone skilled in Lightness could get over the wall unaided. From their auras, it seemed the\nEspenian soldiers wore only as much jade as a middling graduate of Kaul Du Academy, but IBJCS\ntrained them to act together to amplify their collective effectiveness. Kekonese culture revered the\nprowess of the superior jade warrior, accorded respect to the victors of duels, celebrated the heroism\nof patriotic Green Bone rebels in times past—but the Espenians took jade and issued it as military\nequipment with unsentimental uniformity. Hilo’s mouth twitched in a grimace of distaste. He was\ncertain it was no coincidence the Green Bone visitors had been escorted along this path and allowed\nto witness the demonstration on the training field. Whatever the Espenians wanted to talk about this\nafternoon, they were underscoring their message by situating it in the center of their military presence\non Kekon and prefacing it with a reminder that they, too, could use jade.\nThey reached the main building and were shown into a large, if spartan, meeting room,\ncontaining office chairs around a gray table, and the flag of the Republic of Espenia hanging on one\nwall. Secretary Corris, whom Hilo recognized from media photos, was already in the room, engaged\nin a conversation with another man that Shae whispered quickly was Ambassador Gregor Mendoff.\nThe secretary and ambassador broke off their discussion and came over to shake hands. Quire Corris\nwas a typical broad-chested, blue-eyed Espenian man who Hilo thought looked almost the same as\nMendoff, without the mustache. Like many Espenians, he spoke animatedly, barely pausing long\nenough for the translator standing at his elbow to finish relaying his words, but there was also a\ncertain reserve in his manner, a calculating, mercenary quality in his frank gaze. It wasn’t that the\nEspenians were greedy, precisely, Hilo thought, but they always seemed to be holding back some\nhuman warmth, shrewdly considering how to make the deals to get what they wanted.\nChancellor Son and a handful of other members of the Royal Council were also present. “Kaul-"

        "text": "human warmth, shrewdly considering how to make the deals to get what they wanted.\nChancellor Son and a handful of other members of the Royal Council were also present. “Kaul-\njen,” said Son, saluting him. If Secretary Corris and the other Espenians were surprised at either the\nPillar’s youth relative to the other men in the room, or the deference paid to him by the official head\nof government, they were careful not to show it.\nBesides the leaders of No Peak, there was one other individual in the room wearing jade:\nGeneral Ronu Yasugon, senior military advisor to the Royal Council, and perhaps the only person in\nKekonese government who could be said to be an exception to the ironclad cultural and legal\nprohibition against jade in political office. This one violation was deemed acceptable because, like\nmedicine, martial education, and religious penitence, joining the Kekonese military was one of the\nfew ways for a Green Bone to honorably renounce clan oaths and pledge loyalty to another calling.\nUnlike those other professions, however, jade-wearing individuals could not go into military service\nstraight after graduation; they were expected to spend at least one year as a Finger. The clans made\ncertain that most of the young jade talent went first to them; after a certain period, less promising\nFingers were subtly or not-so-subtly encouraged to serve their country in uniform. General Ronu was\nan exception; he’d left the Mountain as a junior Fist to begin a military career eighteen years ago, and\nhe wore more jade than most officers—a watch with six stones set into the steel band. He saluted\nHilo, and the Pillar touched his forehead in greeting. “General.”\nWhen everyone was seated, Secretary Corris began the meeting by talking about what a pleasant\nand productive visit he’d enjoyed, and thanking the government and the people of Kekon for being\nsuch generous hosts. He spoke at length about the importance of Kekon-Espenia relations and the\npremier’s commitment to continued strengthening of the political, economic, and military alliance\nbetween their two nations. “As different as our history and cultures are, we have one crucial thing in\ncommon,” said Corris, pausing to allow the translator to catch up. “A fierce sense of national pride\nand independence, and an equally fierce loyalty to our friends and allies.”\nThose were at least two things, not one, Hilo felt like pointing out, but Ambassador Mendoff\nnodded and smiled in agreement, and the Kekonese listened politely to the foreigner’s hyperbole.\nCorris cleared his throat and said in a graver tone, “As you know, gentlemen—and ladies,” he added\nwith a quick glance at Shae, “the Republic of Espenia has committed considerable resources to\ndefending the sovereignty of Shotar against Ygutanian expansionism. Unfortunately, at this point in\nthe campaign, it’s clear that we still have a long way to go to win the war in Oortoko.”\nThis was a rather significant admission. The Espenians, ever confident in their military might,\nhad anticipated victory in Oortoko within a year. The eastern Shotarian province, however, was\nproving to be a difficult battleground for them.

The terrain was hot, arid, and mountainous with plenty\nof places for the rebels to hide their camps and blend in among the civilian population. The ROE was\nunparalleled in the world in naval strength and also boasted a massive quantity of ground troops and\nbombs, but they were not accustomed to guerrilla warfare against entrenched enemies.\nColonel Deiller spoke up. “Due to the nature of the military engagement, small, nimble, special\noperations teams are proving the key to success in the Oortokon conflict. The physical and\nextrasensory advantages afforded by bioenergetic Kekonese jade allow our elite forces to operate with\ngreater precision and effectiveness, thus minimizing civilian casualties.”\nHilo’s eyes narrowed in impatience. Was this entire meeting another of the foreigners’ attempts\nto persuade Kekon to sell them more jade? Shae had already made it clear to Mendoff and Deiller that\nthe Kekon Jade Alliance would not be increasing quotas.\nSecretary Corris raised his hands. “Now, I understand the issue of jade exports has been\ndiscussed at length before, and although my government is disappointed we can’t see eye to eye, we\nappreciate the pressures you face from prevailing public sentiment about the preservation of your\nnatural resources. What we haven’t fully discussed yet is the potential for Kekon to provide military\nsupport in Oortoko.”\nA frisson of discomfort traveled through the Kekonese side of the room. Chancellor Son leaned\nforward and placed his ample elbows on the table. “Secretary,” he said, speaking slowly for the\ntranslator, “we’re honored by your visit and we value the relationship between our nations, but you\nmust understand: We are a small island nation. We’ve never committed aggression against other\ncountries. In fact, as General Ronu can explain, our military is not designed for such things.”\nRonu was sitting slightly behind and to the left of the chancellor. At the sign that he’d been given\npermission to speak, he straightened and said, “We maintain a modest force of sixty thousand active-\nduty personnel to defend Kekon’s surrounding waters, airspace, and borders.” It was, indeed, a small\nnumber even for a country of only twelve million people. The military was accorded nominal respect,\nbut hardly considered a vital national institution by the Kekonese.\n“I think that’s rather understating the matter, isn’t it, Chancellor?” said Ambassador Mendoff,\nonce Son’s and Ronu’s words had been smoothly relayed into Espenian. “Your official army includes\nseveral thousand personnel equipped with bioenergetic jade. And your real combat strength lies in the\ncivilian population. When you take that into account, it’s no exaggeration to say you have the largest\nreserve force of jade-enhanced soldiers in the world.”\nThe discomfort deepened. Chancellor Son tugged at the collar of his shirt and glanced at Hilo,\nwho was the only other person on the Kekonese side seated directly at the table in a position to speak\nwith the same authority as Son. Slightly behind and to either side of him, Hilo could sense the aura of\nhis Weather Man crackling with wary vexation and the rumble of displeasure from his Horn. The\nEspenians were astute—they understood that Kekon’s actual fighting capability was to be found in the\nranks of the Green Bone clans—but their arrogance was staggering and offensive."

He considered letting Shae speak in his place; she was used to\ndealing with the foreigners and would no doubt give a tactful response. Instead he leaned forward.\nThe Kekonese politicians around the table edged back. Fixing a look on the foreign secretary, the\nPillar said, “Those jade soldiers, as you call them, live by a code that you wouldn’t understand.”\nThough his face retained a mild friendly neutrality, there was an edge to Hilo’s voice that made the\ntranslator hesitate a second before relaying his words. “Green Bones defend Kekon and fight for the\nclan they swear oaths to, not for any foreign government.”\n“You’re the leader of your clan, Mr. Kaul-jen,” said Secretary Corris, without missing a beat.\n“So I assume it’s up to you to decide what your clan’s interests are. And from what I understand, it\nwould seem they’re aligned with ours. Your people have been partnering with us to combat illegal\njade and drug trafficking, seeking investment opportunities, and lobbying for reduced barriers to\ninternational business between our countries. Unlike the other prominent clan leader in this country,\nwhose public rhetoric has been downright antagonistic and jingoistic, your family seems invested in\ncontinued good relations, which we greatly appreciate. That’s why we’re making an effort to maintain\nan open dialogue with you.” No Kekonese person in the room had failed to notice that Ayt Mada and\nrepresentatives of the Mountain clan were not present.\nSecretary Corris continued, “Premier Galtz, myself, and the secretary of the Industry Department\nare prepared to pass several of the trade reforms you’ve been asking for. We’ve already lifted\nrestrictions on foreign real estate ownership, and we’re looking at reduced tariffs on Kekonese\nimports in select industries and a streamlined visa approval process for Kekonese expatriates working\nor pursuing higher education in Espenia. Of course, certain Kekonese companies and organizations\nthat inspire our confidence would be deemed preferred partners.” The secretary inclined his head to\nmake it clear that his statement applied to the people in this room.\nHilo was somewhat surprised; the Espenians were not as ignorant about the clans as he’d\nassumed. They were offering something that would give No Peak an advantage over the Mountain,\nand they knew enough to understand how valuable that was to the Kaul family. Hilo suspected that if\nhe turned to consult with his Weather Man, she could quantify the value in terms of dien—but there\nwas no point. Everything was a transaction to the Espenians—and some prices were too high to pay.\nHilo laid his hands on the table and said, “My Weather Man has been working hard to expand\nour businesses, so naturally we’d like to see all those things you mention come true.” Shae had once\ntold him that the Espenians interpreted the word no merely as the starting point for negotiation, so he\npaused to make it absolutely clear that he meant what he said next. “But as Pillar of my clan, I will\nnever send Green Bones to fight for strangers, no matter what you offer.”\nThe secretary appeared unperturbed by Hilo’s blunt refusal. “Kekon is the linchpin of our"

If we can’t count on your military contribution to this vital\neffort, then it’s all the more important that we have your staunch political support.”\nChancellor Son let out a cough. “Kekon is hosting more foreign troops on our soil than at any\ntime since we achieved independence in the Many Nations War. That is considerable support.”\n“It’s to our mutual benefit,” said Colonel Deiller. “The presence of ROE forces on Euman Island\nacts as a deterrent to aggression in this region and ensures your country’s safety.”\n“A few months ago,” Hilo said in a soft, almost placid voice, “I spoke to a couple whose sixteen-\nyear-old daughter was raped by Espenian soldiers. Ask Mr. and Mrs. Eyun if the foreign troops\ngambling, whoring, and getting drunk on shore leave in our city streets is good for safety.”\nAmbassador Mendoff winced in distaste. “Tragic, isolated incidents notwithstanding,” he said,\nundeterred, “what we’re concerned about is Kekon’s willingness to stand firm on issues of regional\nsecurity, namely, acting as a reliable bulwark against the growing threat of Ygutan.”\n“Ygutan’s aims are to expand its territory and extend its influence in any way possible,” added\nColonel Deiller. “The Directorate in Dramsk and their body of religious leaders, the Protecks, are\npreaching a vision of manifest national destiny in which the Ygut Coalition stretches across the\ncontinent of Orius from the Amaric to the Ullyric Ocean. If, God forbid, Oortoko falls to the\nYgutanians, Dramsk will be emboldened to commit further acts of aggression. Kekon’s proximity to\nthe Orius continent, its unique resources, and its strategic position in the West Tun Sea would make it\nan obvious target.”\nThe Kekonese politicians exchanged sullen glances but did not respond to Deiller’s assertions.\nAn attack by Ygutan was possible, but Hilo was certain the Espenians were overstating the danger.\nThe truth was that an Ygutanian victory in Oortoko would have a far more certain and immediate\nconsequence for Kekon: It would cause the ROE to panic and pour even more military resources into\nthe region, to assert control over Kekon before their enemies did, all in the stated interests of\n“defending” their allies.\n“We’re aware,” said Secretary Corris, “that there’s a growing desire from the civilian population,\nand from some parts of your government, for Kekon to increase its humanitarian involvement in the\nwar, particularly in regards to admitting and resettling refugees.”\nChancellor Son nodded warily. Mounting civilian casualties in the Oortoko region had captured\nthe public consciousness; people were moved by the plight of the ethnic Kekonese in the region—\nthose who’d been relocated to Shotar generations ago, oppressed and discriminated against by\nShotarian society, and were now suffering in a bloody contest between foreign powers.

Even the\nprevalent stereotype of Keko-Shotarians as mixed blood, nephrite-wearing barukan gangsters had not\ndiscouraged grassroots calls to repatriate Oortokon refugees. That, Hilo mused cynically, was the\nundeniable power of television. At what other time in history had the Kekonese ever bothered to care\nabout what was happening to people overseas?\n“The human sentiment is understandable, but it poses a security risk that we’re not sure you’ve\nfully analyzed,” said Ambassador Mendoff. It irritated Hilo that the Espenians kept changing who\nwas speaking, so he was forced to continue shifting his attention. Secretary Corris was supposedly the\nhighest-ranking person on their side, and it seemed the others were in agreement with him, so why\nwas it necessary for them all to take turns jumping in unprompted?\nAs if to underscore Hilo’s thoughts, Colonel Deiller said, “Ygutanian agents are prevalent in\nOortoko, and our intelligence has confirmed that there are ties between the rebels and Keko-Shotarian\norganized crime groups. Unless Kekon is vigilant about guarding its borders, it risks Ygutanian\ninfiltration, which would be an unacceptable danger to our military assets here.”\n“Your assets,” Chancellor Son echoed dubiously.\n“It’s in your interest to take this threat seriously,” Colonel Deiller responded. “Currently, there\nare no restrictions on travel within Kekon. Civilians move freely between Euman Island and the rest\nof the country. That would change if there were Ygutanian agents within your population who could\nsteal military information, sabotage our facilities, or send bombing coordinates to Dramsk. They\nmight even work to undermine your government and install a more Ygutanian-friendly regime. The\nbest line of joint defense against such unacceptable risks is to prevent them from entering in the first\nplace.”\nNo one replied for a moment. Then Hilo’s mouth curved into a humorless, sardonic smile. “You\nwant us to keep out other foreigners, in order to protect the ones that are already here.”\nSecretary Corris pursed his lips to one side and gave a small shrug that, while not in overt\nagreement with Hilo’s statement, was ample confirmation. “What we want is the assurance that our\nallies in Kekon will do their utmost to influence public policy and legislation in a way that preserves\nthe long-term strength of our relationship and our mutual security. We want to feel confident that\nyou’ll stand against other, more shortsighted, rabble-rousing voices—and we’d like to help you do\nthat, by making it economically advantageous to remain our friends.”\nHilo nodded, then stood up. The Espenians had said everything they’d intended to say, and he\nwas tiring rapidly of the long-winded sugary political talk, not to mention the continued pretense that\nthis was anything but a bribe, made at the highest level. Gods in Heaven, he’d been a Fist and then\nthe Horn for years before he was Pillar; he knew all about the delicate balance of threat and\ninducement required to get what one wanted from reluctant assets. Shae and Kehn stood up with him,\nand after a beat, Chancellor Son and the other Kekonese politicians did so as well. Secretary Corris\nfollowed their movement with faintly raised eyebrows."

I’ll deal with\nyou and your government so long as it benefits No Peak. But you’re still visitors here. Don’t ask for\ntoo much, or presume to control Kekon. Other foreigners have tried before you.”\nWhen the translator had finished repeating Hilo’s words, Secretary Corris smiled, showing a\nflash of white teeth, and to the surprise of everyone in the room, raised clasped hands and touched\nthem to his forehead in the traditional Kekonese salute. It was done with just the right amount of\ndeliberation to be a pointedly casual retort without being overtly mocking.\n“May the gods shine favor on your clan, as they say in your country, Mr. Kaul-jen,” said the\nEspenian diplomat. “Or as they say in mine: ‘May you see and bear the Truth.’”\n“Fucking Espenians,” Hilo said, after dinner that evening.\nKehn grumbled in agreement and pushed back his empty plate. “Dealing with them is like\nwrestling a creature with many heads. One head’s smiling at you, another’s stealing your food, a\nthird’s taking a bite out of your ass.” The Horn crossed his arms. “They knew we wouldn’t send\nGreen Bones to fight on their side in that hellhole. They only said it so they could be more forceful\nasking for what they thought they could really get.”\n“Spennies—they’d line up to sell their own mothers just to see who could get the best price.” Tar\nwas leaning back with a contentedly lazy look on his face, having spent the afternoon with his\nsometimes lover Iyn Ro instead of on Euman Naval Base.\n“You could’ve let me mention a few things in that meeting,” Shae said to Hilo, a little sourly.\n“Such as the fact that the proposed trade agreements benefit their economy as well. Manufacturing\ncapacity in Espenia has been shifted to the war effort and they need foreign trade to meet consumer\ndemand. So it’s not as if the leverage they’re trying to apply is one-sided.”\n“There were already enough people in that meeting trying to sound like the smartest one in the\nroom,” Hilo replied. “The bottom line is we’re stuck: Most people hate the foreigners being here and\nwant to suck on Ayt’s teat every time she whips out another of her speeches, but we’ve tied ourselves\nto their godsdamned money.”\nShae crossed her arms in response to Hilo’s squint. “You’re looking at me as if it’s my fault the\nEspenians are demanding and unscrupulous. Yes, they’ll try to take advantage of us, they’ll make\noffensive requests, they’ll bargain for the most they can get out of every situation—that’s their way.\nBut they’re still our strongest edge over the Mountain.” The destruction of the Mountain’s shine\nfactories in Ygutan five months ago had dealt Ayt a serious financial blow.

But if we secure trade agreements that benefit us and\nlock them out of the Espenian market, we could be the larger clan in five to ten years.”\nHilo approved of Shae and her people eking out every economic victory they could over the\nMountain—anything to weaken Ayt Mada’s position as a leader and strengthen internal opposition\nagainst her—but he was not willing to wait five to ten years for results. K-Star Freight was\nprospering, raising the Ven family’s prominence in the Mountain, but Ven Sando’s opposition to his\nPillar had not yet spawned any concrete action that would see Ayt feeding worms in the Heaven\nAwaiting Cemetery.\n“Ayt’s been too quiet lately,” Hilo mused. Perhaps she wasn’t as eager to make public\nappearances now that Shae had cut off half her ear, but Hilo wasn’t so optimistic as to think she had\nbeen dissuaded by her failed attempt to oust Shae and bring down No Peak in the process. More\nlikely she was simply gathering her resources for some other attack. “Money’s not enough; we need\nto keep stirring the Mountain’s shit so it doesn’t settle. Have you dug into the Iwe family, like I\nasked?”\nShae frowned at the way Hilo changed the subject, but she said, “There’s nothing on Iwe\nKalundo. He wears two jade rings on his smallest fingers, and a band of three stones on his left wrist,\nand has never had any problems so far as anyone knows.” Shae opened her hands and turned them up.\n“But… his aunt nearly died of an SN1 overdose two years ago and doesn’t wear any jade now. Both\nIwe’s youngest brother and his cousins are addicts, and they use the same supplier—a dealer in the\nCrossyards who’s rumored to quietly sell the highest-quality shine to Green Bones.”\nHilo eyed his sister, impressed. “How did you find this out?”\n“Rats are everywhere these days,” Shae said, so smugly that Hilo smirked. Gossip about drug\naddiction and vice was not exactly the sort of intelligence he’d imagined the Weather Man’s network\nwould be able to deliver, but if Shae was exercising some creativity in her role, he wasn’t about to\ncomplain.\nWen smiled and spoke up. Long gone, it seemed, were the days when she would hold her tongue\nexcept when she and Hilo were alone. “If we know who to look for, it shouldn’t take long for Kehn’s\nFingers to find this dealer.”\n“Do it quietly,” Hilo said to the Horn. “Tell me when you’ve found him, but don’t act unless I\nsay so. You have enough to do already, handling the raids on Ti Pasuiga.”\nKehn’s wife, Lina, came back into the dining room with Ru, his diaper freshly changed, and\nhanded him back to Wen.

Tar made a teasing face of mock disgust and\nthrew a napkin at his brother.\nKehn tossed the napkin back at Tar, his usual gruffness reasserting itself as he returned his\nattention to the table. “Our attacks on Ti Pasuiga—there’s good and bad news,” he said. “The good\nnews is that we’ve killed dozens of Zapunyo’s rockfish, confiscated hundreds of kilos of raw scrap,\nand about five hundred million dien worth of cut jade.”\nNot for the first time, Hilo envied his brother-in-law. The duties of the Horn were difficult and\ndangerous, but simpler and more tangible. “The bad news,” Kehn went on, “is that clever dog\nZapunyo keeps getting more creative. I’ve seen jade disguised as buttons and children’s toy marbles,\npacked in frozen seafood, or hidden in canned goods. We catch some of it, but the Espenian navy\ncatches more. Another reason why Shae-jen is right. We need to stay in bed with the foreigners if we\nwant to put that Uwiwan dog out of business.”\nTar shook his head at the irony. “The spennies start a war that grows the black market for jade.\nWe get them to help us shut down the smuggling that they caused in the first place, and in return they\nexpect us to be grateful and do their bidding like children.”\nThe political demands of the Espenians, the constant threat of the Mountain, the dirty schemes of\nTi Pasuiga—any one of them was more than enough to have to deal with, but they were all connected\nin inextricable ways that made Hilo frustrated and uneasy. “It’s getting late,” he said. “That’s enough\ntalk for tonight.”\nKehn and Tar departed for their own homes. Niko came down the stairs to say that he’d had a\nnightmare and didn’t want to be alone. Wen handed Ru to Hilo and rose with a pregnant groan to\nsettle the boy back to bed. The Pillar and the Weather Man were left alone in the dining room except\nfor the drowsy child in Hilo’s arms and the sound of Kyanla doing dishes in the kitchen. Shae\nappeared deep in thought; Hilo noticed that she’d developed the habit of rubbing absently at her bare\nthroat where her two-tier jade choker had once rested.\nShae dropped her hand and turned to him. “I’m going to Espenia for a couple of weeks,” she\nsaid. “I’ve been thinking about what Anden told me over the phone, and I think we should meet these\npeople, these Green Bones in Port Massy. One thing was clear from the meeting on Euman Island\ntoday: The Espenians have leverage over us because they have people here, and they know more\nabout what’s happening in our country than we know about what’s going on in theirs.

It seems\neverything the Espenians do affects us in some way, and from what Anden’s said, their largest city is\nturning into a battleground for jade, just like here at home. I need to go over there and learn more.”\nHilo considered her words. “No,” he said after a minute. “You need to stay here. There’s too\nmuch political bullshit going on with the Royal Council, the KJA, and the Espenians these days. You\ncan’t afford to be gone from Kekon that long in case something happens, and now that you have the\nsupport of the clan back under you, the last thing you should do is leave Ship Street and travel to\nEspenia again.” The Weather Man opened her mouth to argue, but Hilo said, “I’ll go.”\nShae did not mask her surprise. “You… will?”\n“I’m the Pillar; if this could be as important as you say, I should handle it in person. You keep\ntelling me that our advantage is in Espenia, that we need to invest there. I’m going to that country to\nsee it for myself.” Part of the problem, Hilo thought, was that foreign people and businesses had\nalways been Shae’s thing. Now they were too much a part of No Peak’s fate, indeed Kekon’s fate, for\nhim to leave them entirely to his sister’s attention. Hilo had always found that when things were\nunclear, when he couldn’t immediately see the right action to take in a confusing situation, he needed\nto get closer. Talk to the right people, understand it all better. The solution was always there on the\nstreet, somewhere in plain sight.\nRu began to fuss, and Hilo stood up to walk around and calm him. “Besides,” Hilo said quietly,\n“it’s been a long time since I’ve seen Andy. Too long, I think.”\nCHAPTER\n36\nWhat You Deserve\nB\nero and Mudt sat on the floor of Bero’s apartment, drinking and practicing their Channeling on a\npair of rats that Mudt had lured and captured in a plastic bucket in the alleyway behind the building.\n“I say we learn how to make shine ourselves,” Bero said. “Then we can sell it and save what’s left of\nthe good stuff for ourselves.”\n“Sure, keke.” Mudt opened a bottle of beer and took a large swallow from it. “You got a lab to\nsynthesize chemicals?”\n“We’re not the fucking Espenian military,” Bero scoffed. “You can make street shine if you can\nget syrup.” The main ingredient in SN1 could be found in small quantities in plant-based remedies\nthat had been used since ancient times as a health aid; if you could steal or smuggle prescription\nmedicine out of a hospital or pharmacy, you could distill it into “syrup” and amplify its potency with\nindustrial chemicals.\nBero hovered his hand over the bucket on the ground. If he closed his eyes, he could Perceive\nthe rats more clearly, as thrumming hot spots of energy. Trying to visualize his own jade energy as\nsomething he could extend beyond his own body, like a sharp weapon held in his hand, Bero\nChanneled into one of the rodents with a two-fingered jab.

The animal fell stunned onto its side, legs\ntwitching in pain, but not dead. “Godsdamnit.”\nMudt handed the beer bottle to Bero. “Have the rest.”\n“I thought you liked this stuff.”\n“Not anymore. It’s cheap Ygutanian shit.” Mudt put his hand in the bucket, his face tight with a\nconcentration that looked almost angry, and touched the other rat. It gave a little jump, staggered in a\ncircle, and keeled over dead. Bero scowled and drank the rest of the beer. Since when had Mudt\ngotten better than him at Channeling? Had he been practicing?\nBero admitted there had not been much else to do for the past three months. They hadn’t seen or\nheard anything from Soradiyo. The ungrateful barukan sheep fucker had cut them out and was\nprobably giving all the jobs to Mo and Shrimps now. Which meant that Bero once again needed to\nthink about how to bolster his income stream. “I already have clients who buy from me, regular,”\nBero went on. “All we need is to set up our own supply.” He wiped the back of a hand over his\nsweaty brow; the last typhoon of the season had brought down the lingering summer heat but also\nknocked out the power in Bero’s building, so none of the fans were working.\nMudt said, “Your clients don’t come to you for the weak stuff cooked with drain cleaner that’ll\nmake you go blind. They come to you for quality shine.” He turned to Bero, his small eyes dead cold.\n“Shine you stole from my da’s storeroom after he died.”\nBero stared at him. He’s drunk. But Mudt’s gaze was steady, his face flushed from anger, not\nbooze. Bero growled, his voice a low threat, “Are you calling me a thief?”\nIt was a cliché, posturing thing to say—the sort of challenge that started bar brawls—and Mudt\njust laughed in an oddly high giggle. “That’s real funny, keke. We are thieves, remember? We’re the\nlowest of the low.” His voice took on a strange edge. “But you… you’re something else. My da gave\nyou work and paid you good money, and then when everyone was looking to have you killed, he\nsaved your life. And you took his shine for yourself and you sold it, and you pretended the whole time\nlike you cared to help me avenge him, but you never did. You only kept me around because I was\nuseful, but you never intended to pay my da back for anything he did for you. You’d never stick your\nneck out for anyone but yourself. You’ve got jade, but you don’t know what to do with it because\nyou’ve got nothing to live for. I might be a thief, but at least I’ve got reasons. You’ve got nothing.\nYou are nothing.”\nIt was the longest speech that Bero had ever heard the teenager give. Bero stared at Mudt with\nastonishment.

I came up with the plan to get\nKaul’s jade; I got us into the Rat House; I got us the scavenging work—everything’s been my idea all\nalong, you’re the one who’s nothing and you’re saying that I’m nothing? I ought to—”\nBero lurched up to grab Mudt by the throat, but the boy leapt up and scrambled out of Bero’s\ngrasp. Bero lunged after him, but suddenly the ground seemed to tilt under his feet; he staggered and\nfell against the sofa. A wave of dizziness swept over him and his head swam. He hadn’t had that\nmuch to drink yet, definitely not more than Mudt, and Mudt was standing with no problem, watching\nhim impassively, expectantly.\nIn one sharp instant of clarity, Bero realized what was happening. He stared at the empty bottle\nof beer he’d knocked over on the floor. He remembered that he’d once told Mudt why his face was\ncrooked—had explained with regret and yet some pride that he’d almost managed to steal jade\nstraight off a drunken Green Bone by drugging his drink, years ago.\n“You fucker.” Bero tried to shake the descending curtain out of his head; he blinked and cursed\nand crawled forward toward Mudt with murder on his mind. “You shit-eating little rat fuck.” Bero’s\nstomach churned and convulsive spikes of pain shot through his guts. He tried to summon his focus;\nwith a snarl of effort, he unleashed a feeble Deflection in Mudt’s direction. It went wide, knocking a\nlamp off a table and sending it into the wall with a crash. Mudt didn’t even move.\nBero curled on the carpet, sweating, clutching his stomach, tongue lolling. Through a fog, he\nsaw Mudt approach and stand over him with something in his hand. Bero couldn’t see what it was\nuntil his betrayer bent down and jabbed him in the thigh with it. Mudt depressed the syringe, shooting\na triple dose of concentrated SN1 into Bero’s veins. Enough to send his heart into convulsions.\nEnough to kill him.\nBero tried once more to wrap his hands around Mudt’s skinny neck, but the teenager used his\nStrength to break Bero’s grip easily. He sat on Bero’s chest, pinning his arms, and as Bero’s eyes\nrolled and his mouth worked frantically, Mudt removed the string of jade from around Bero’s neck\nand placed it around his own. Bero’s world dimmed. The poison in his drink, the overdose of shine in\nhis blood, the jade being torn away from him—he couldn’t tell which of the three was most rapidly\nrobbing him of the ability to move, to speak, to think.\nMudt stood back up. “I’m not sorry for you,” he said, but he sounded hesitant, as if he were\nsaying it to convince himself. He stared at Bero for a long moment, then said, with greater conviction,"

You’re only getting what you deserve.”\nBero’s fingers clutched at Mudt’s ankle. Mudt stepped out of reach, and Bero flopped and rolled\nafter him on the ground like a fish flung onto the deck of a boat. He heard Mudt walking away, and\nthen he heard the sound of the apartment door opening and shutting. Mudt was gone, and he had\ntaken Bero’s jade and left Bero to die. Mudt! That greasy little kid, that nobody, that boy who’d\nworked in the Goody Too and had always seemed so dim. He’d been killed by Mudt, who was\nsupposed to be weaker, supposed to be the sidekick, and who had become the only person Bero\nmight’ve called a friend—and the irony of it was such that Bero was overwhelmed by the desire to\nlaugh and to scream and to bash in the boy’s skull.\nWith this last surge of hate, Bero crawled to the apartment door and heaved himself against it;\nthe loose lock popped and he fell across the threshold, and then it seemed he was being dragged\nbackward down a very long, dark tunnel.\nCHAPTER\n37\nThreats and Schemes\nA\nlarge insulated shipping container marked to the attention of the No Peak clan was discovered in a\nboathouse in the Docks on the basis of an anonymous tip. The box, normally used to transport frozen\nseafood, contained the dismembered body of an Uwiwan man—arms, legs, hands, feet, cock, torso,\nhead. One of the Fingers, Heike, leaned over the water and lost his latest meal; Lott kept his gorge\ndown as he peered at the grisly sight before taking a hasty step back. “Who was it, Maik-jen?”\nKehn closed the lid on the body; it seemed indecent to look at the parts for long, particularly as\nhe thought it likely the man had been alive for at least part of the time that they were being separated.\n“One of our rats in Tialuhiya,” Kehn said. “My guess is the one who tipped us off on the Amaric\nPride.” Kehn was not the sort of person to openly show the full extent of his disappointment or anger;\nit had been his habit since he was a boy to be the calm one, to keep Tar out of trouble, or if they were\nalready in trouble, to get them out. Now, however, he stormed out of the boathouse under a dark\ncloud. Establishing and maintaining informers in the Uwiwa Islands was painstaking work and a\nsignificant investment of time and money on the part of the Horn’s side of the clan. In Kekon, No\nPeak had ample resources and influence, but it was not easy to recruit, control, and protect White Rats\nin other countries. When, despite all efforts, some of them were discovered by Ti Pasuiga and\ngrotesquely punished, it scared all the others, and No Peak could not effectively retaliate.\nKehn stewed on these troubles and thought about how to bring them to the attention of the Pillar.\n“We’ve lost rats before,” he explained the following day over lunch in the Twice Lucky, “but they just"

This is the first time Zapunyo’s rubbed our face in it, sending us a body in pieces like that.\nSmugglers used to be mostly a nuisance, but Ti Pasuiga is well organized and feared in those islands,\nand now it’s not afraid to offend us directly. That Uwiwan cur has gotten too bold.”\n“He’s frustrated,” Hilo said, passing the plate of duck skewers to Tar. “Zapunyo has plenty of\ndirty money and cheap lives, but if he can’t get jade out of Kekon and move it to buyers, he doesn’t\nhave a business. The Ygutanians, the Oortokon rebels, and the barukan who’re supporting the\nrebellion because they hate the Shotarian government—those are his biggest customers, and with the\nheat you’ve put on his routes through the Origas Gulf and East Amaric, he’s stuck.”\nThe Pillar seemed less upset about the slain rat than Kehn had expected, or perhaps he was\nsimply preoccupied, thinking about his upcoming trip to Espenia. While he was gone, the Weather\nMan would be in charge of No Peak, and although Kehn liked Kaul Shae well enough, she worked\nbehind a desk and had no real understanding of the military side of the clan. He was accustomed to\nbeing able to consult with Hilo-jen about every aspect of the Horn’s responsibilities. “Zapunyo’s\nstarting to look to other markets,” he said. “He already brews SN1 to keep his scrap pickers and\nrockfish and polishers from getting the Itches; it’s natural that he’s also making it to sell for profit,\nespecially now that the Mountain’s factories in Ygutan are gone. We’ve heard he’s trying to partner\nwith other groups—drug cartels, arms dealers, prostitution rings—to distribute jade and shine in other\nparts of the world.”\n“Why can’t the Espenians get the Uwiwan government to deal with Zapunyo?” Tar asked. “They\nknow where his mansion is; why not just kill him?”\n“The Uwiwan government is a corrupt black hole,” Hilo said. “Parts of that country are lawless,\nand half of the foreign aid that goes into that place disappears.”\n“Ti Pasuiga pays the police more than the government does,” Kehn said. “And Zapunyo makes\nhimself out to be a generous man, giving money to the local towns to build roads and schools and\ntemples. He’s practically untouchable in that country. We may be harming his business, but as long as\nhe’s alive, he’ll keep being a problem for us.” Kehn scratched his jaw. “Hilo-jen, we have to think of\nhow to whisper his name.”\nHilo barely reacted to his Horn’s pronouncement. Kehn expected the Pillar had already thought\nabout this but not come to any satisfactory conclusions. “We have enemies here at home that we’ve\nbeen trying to put into the ground for years. We can only handle so many things at one time,” Hilo\nsaid.\nTwo weeks ago, on the Pillar’s discreet instructions, the Janloon city police had arrested and"

We can only handle so many things at one time,” Hilo\nsaid.\nTwo weeks ago, on the Pillar’s discreet instructions, the Janloon city police had arrested and\ninterrogated the shine dealer Shae had spoken of and Kehn’s Fingers had quietly tracked down. The\nman cut a deal by naming several high-profile Green Bone clients, including immediate relatives of\nIwe Kalundo, the Mountain clan’s Weather Man. No Peak made sure that news of both the arrest and\nthe clients who’d been named was leaked to the press. Ayt Mada was not the only one who could use\nthe media to paint her rivals in an unflattering light. The story had reignited a public debate about the\nevils of SN1, but more importantly, renewed concerns about the leadership of the Mountain clan\npossibly falling to the Iwe family.\nMeanwhile, No Peak had solved some of the problems it was having on Poor Man’s Road by\noffloading it onto their rivals. On Hilo’s orders, Kehn’s Green Bones had shut down prostitution in\nthe gambling triangle of the Armpit district; pimps were forcefully run out and warned not to be\ncaught anywhere near the casinos. Instead, the No Peak chance houses put up posters and distributed\nleaflets advertising the strip clubs and brothels in the nearby Mountain-controlled districts of Dog’s\nHead and Spearpoint. Rowdy Espenian servicemen were migrating their money and troublesome\ndisorderliness into Mountain territory; recently a group of three drunken foreign sailors had gotten\ninto an altercation with some Green Bones of the Koben family and wound up in the hospital, which\nforced Ayt Mada into the humiliating position of having to publicly support the imprudent Kobens\nwhile quietly paying off the Espenians.\nKehn admired Hilo-jen’s tactical cunning, though he could not help but think that the Pillar’s\npreoccupation with destabilizing the Mountain was like trying to light wet grass on fire: They were\nmaking a lot of sparks and smoke, but so far no roaring flames had erupted.\nPerhaps Hilo was thinking the same thing because he pushed his plate of remaining food aside\nand said to Tar, “Have someone in the Koben family killed. Not the kid or his mother, but a Green\nBone man, someone close to them. Not by you or any of your men; the job has to be hired out, and it\ncan’t be traced back to No Peak in any way. Make it an obvious thing, not an accident.”\n“The kid’s ma has a brother who wears jade, and an uncle,” Tar said.\n“That’s good,” said Hilo. “Either of them would do. It’s better if he dies, but even if he doesn’t,\nit’s okay. So long as they don’t know who to blame.” The Maiks nodded; the Kobens were numerous\nbut not very clever; now that they seemed to be ahead of the Iwes, perhaps they could be provoked\ninto useful violence, as they had been against the drunk foreigners. Tar began to ask a question, but\nMr. Une, the Lantern Man owner of the Twice Lucky, came around to pay his respects and they\nchatted with him pleasantly for a few minutes. After the smiling restaurateur saluted and withdrew,\nHilo answered his Pillarman. “No rush on killing one of the Kobens; sometime after we get back from\nEspenia is fine.”"

Losing some rats is expected, but you’re right to be angry and offended by this. We\nhave a lot of things going on right now, but I agree we have to move stronger on Ti Pasuiga. We’ll\nthink about it some more, when I get back.”\nTau Maro returned from a lunch-hour meeting with the board of directors of Four Virtues\nInternational feeling both cautiously optimistic and deeply frustrated. The grassroots charitable\norganization was only a year old but had already exceeded its initial public fundraising goals and was\ngetting considerable positive press; on the other hand, efforts to lobby Wisdom Hall on key issues\nsuch as refugees were meeting with little success. When it came to business and politics, it was still\nexceedingly difficult to accomplish anything in a timely manner without clan support. There ought to\nbe a word, Maro mused, for the particular combination of persistent hope and inescapable difficulty\nthat seemed to prevail in all aspects of his life—from climbing the academic ladder, to policy and\nnonprofit work, to matters of the heart.\nHe walked into his office to find three men waiting for him. Two of them were young enough to\nbe undergraduates, but he did not recognize them as students in any of his classes. The third man,\nsitting in Maro’s desk chair and swiveling it around slowly, had a jade aura but was not wearing any\nof his jade in plain sight. In Janloon, that was the equivalent of showing off the jacket bulge of an\nillegal pistol; it could only mean that he was not entitled to his green and was a criminal of some sort.\nMaro stood in the doorway of his office, tamping down suspicion and alarm. “I’m sorry, this\nisn’t your office,” he said.\n“We’re looking for Dr. Tau Marosun,” said the man in his chair.\n“Who are you?” Maro asked, keeping his voice even.\n“A half-shottie bastard,” said the man, speaking in perfect Shotarian. “Just like you.” Maro\ntensed as the uninvited guest rose from behind the desk and walked up to Maro with a partial smile on\nhis narrow, tanned face. There was no menace in his manner or hostility in his aura, but Maro took an\ninvoluntary step back as the man gently closed the office door and said, “It’s okay, Dr. Tau. I’m not\ntrying to offend you. I know how prejudiced the Kekonese can be, and I understand you don’t want\nyour colleagues to know the real reason you make so many trips to Leyolo City.” The man hadn’t\ngiven a name. He looked like a villain straight out of a Shotarian crime movie, Maro thought. Lumpy\nknuckles and a cruel mouth. Maro stared at him with a rising sense of disbelief, and despite himself, a\nfrisson of fear.\nThe stranger said, “You have to look out for yourself, after all.

Say, Dr. Tau: Are you still fucking the Kaul\nwoman, or are things over between you two?”\nMaro’s head jerked around to stare; his unease took a sharp turn into anger. “If you people think\nyou can bribe or blackmail me, you’re wrong,” he said. “I don’t have any special knowledge of the\nNo Peak clan, and even if I did, I wouldn’t give it to you for any price or threat. Go ahead, tell\neveryone I’m of mixed blood. Start a xenophobic scandal, like you did with Kaul Shae. I’m not afraid\nto lose my job; I’ll let my work speak for itself.”\nThe narrow-faced man raised his hands in a mock placating gesture. “Relax. Do I look like I’m\nfrom the Mountain clan? My friends and I had nothing to do with those nasty accusations against\nyour girlfriend. We don’t want any information from you.”\n“Then what do you want?” Maro demanded.\n“An introduction,” said the stranger. “That’s all. Like I said, we’re not from the Mountain. You\nknow the Kaul family personally. We would like to set up a meeting.”\nA chill traveled through Maro’s body. He yanked open his office door. “Get out,” he said, trying\nand failing to keep his voice from trembling. “And don’t ever come back.”\nThe man replied, with sudden ice in his voice, “You’re not being reasonable. What do you owe\nto No Peak, that’s worth refusing our request so rudely? Think about it.” With a jerk of his head, the\nman motioned to the two teenage thugs he’d brought along with him. They shrugged and moved\naway from the wall they’d been leaning against. The leader said, in an offhanded way, still speaking\nin Shotarian, “Remember that we know a lot more about you than you know about us, Dr. Tau.\nConsider that before you do or say anything else hasty.”\nThe men left unhurriedly. Maro shut his office door and fell into his chair. He shuddered,\nunnerved, to find the leather still warm from the stranger’s body heat.\nCHAPTER\n38\nNot the Real Thing\nM\nudt walked into the Pig & Pig pub in Coinwash and sat down at the counter. “A plate of the\nbattered shrimp and a glass of the Brevnya ale.” The bartender eyed Mudt skeptically on account of\nhis age, but seeing as he appeared to be a heavily jaded Green Bone, he asked, “You want a regular\nglass or the extra tall, jen? It’s only five dien more on Seconddays.”\n“The extra tall then,” said Mudt. The battered shrimp and the beer arrived, and Mudt took his\ntime enjoying his meal.

He was in a celebratory mood; today, for the first time, he’d combined\nLightness and Steel—he’d run to the edge of the roof of his apartment and leapt a full twenty meters\nto the top of the building next door. He’d hit the concrete, rolled, and collapsed on his back, his heart\npounding with adrenaline and all the breath knocked out of him, but uninjured, with not even a bruise.\nAll his long hours of obsessive practice were starting to pay off. He knew he was still a long way off\nfrom being able to take on someone like Maik Tar, a Green Bone with years of training. He would\nneed to bide his time and also think of some way to gain an unexpected advantage, the way he had\nwhen he’d drugged Bero’s drink.\nMudt could not help but feel remorse for murdering Bero, and even after all these weeks, he\nmissed the other teen’s company and wished he had someone to talk to, to share his success today. He\nwas still haunted by the way Bero had lain on the floor twitching in those last minutes, eyes rolling\nwith impotent rage. But with each fortifying swallow of ale Mudt took, the feeling diminished. There\nwasn’t any room in this world to be soft. Look at the Green Bone clans. A real Green Bone wouldn’t\ngive a second thought to killing an enemy and taking his jade. That was the sort of person Mudt\nneeded to be if he was going to achieve his eventual revenge against Maik Tar and the No Peak clan.\nMudt ordered another extra tall glass of beer and reassured himself with the knowledge that the\nworld had suffered no great loss from Bero no longer being a part of it. Mudt had even heard his\nfather once say, “I think he’s a sociopath.” In their world, that was not necessarily a bad thing. Mudt\nhad looked up to the older teen for a long time. Unlike Mudt, Bero had seemed so confident and\ntough, not afraid of anybody. Mudt admired that about him.\nThe jade around Mudt’s neck felt warm and heavy. It moved and rolled on his skin like\nsomething alive, that gave life. He’d had to increase his daily dose of shine to carry it all. Fortunately,\nhe knew where Bero kept his stash hidden, and unlike Bero, he also knew how to get more. He might,\nat one time, have told Bero, if Bero had ever bothered to ask him.\nThe pub was slow at first, but more people arrived as the night went on. A group of five college-\nage girls arrived, dressed in short skirts and high heels. They were on a mission to get their friend,\nwho had just been dumped by her asshole boyfriend, properly drunk. “A Green Bone,” one of them\nexclaimed, flashing a coy smile at Mudt after she’d ordered her drink from the bar. “I haven’t seen\nyou before, but you must be a Fist. Are you new around here?”\n“He’s not a Fist.” An older girl rolled her eyes at her friend’s naïveté. “He’s too young. That\ncan’t be real jade.”\n“It is real,” Mudt said, his face warming. He’d never been noticed by women before, had barely\never had any conversations with them. His head buzzed from the booze and his stomach felt bloated"

        "text": "“It is real,” Mudt said, his face warming. He’d never been noticed by women before, had barely\never had any conversations with them. His head buzzed from the booze and his stomach felt bloated\nwith fried food. With this much jade, his sense of Perception was distracting, overwhelming. The girls\nseemed like furnaces of energy standing close to him—he had a hard time focusing on their faces.\n“Do I look like some barukan poser? Every bit of green you see is the real thing.”\nThe older of the two girls said, “How did you get it then, since you can’t even be twenty?” She\nfeigned intense interest. “Did you win it in duels? Is your family name Kaul?”\nHer friend laughed. The girls wore perfume and makeup and they were as pretty as models on\ntelevision, even as they laughed at him. Twin surges of embarrassment and anger flooded Mudt’s\nbrain. People treated Green Bones with respect. That was the way it was supposed to be, the way it\nhad always been. They wouldn’t dare to question Green Bones about how they’d earned their jade or\nspeak to them in a condescending way, the way these girls were speaking to him.\nBut not everyone who wore jade these days was worthy of deference. They could be found in\nJanloon, or on television, or in gossip talk: new green and barukan and foreign gangsters and\nEspenian soldiers who killed even women and children.\nMudt had jade, but he was not a Green Bone; he had not been raised or trained as one and so he\nwas not convincing as one. He had a wary, twitchy, cowed manner that became apparent to anyone\nwho spoke to him for a few minutes. On some deep and shameful level, he knew this about himself,\nand he knew the girls at the bar could sense it too. In that instant, he remembered how Bero had stood\nup to the disbelief and laughter of the Mountain Green Bones on that night in the forest when Mudt\nhad been sure they were both going to be killed. Bero had been selfish and reckless, but he hadn’t\nbeen afraid.\nMudt turned to the girls and blurted, “What makes you think the Kauls are so special? You want\nto know where I got my jade? I won it. I took it off the body of Kaul Lan himself.”\nThe two girls stared at him. Mudt saw that he’d gone too far. He might as well have stood on the\ncounter and proclaimed himself the reincarnation of Jenshu. Unlike Nau Suen and the Mountain\nGreen Bones, no one here was amused by new green bravado; they did not want to be seen\nassociating with him. The girls began to edge away as if he’d admitted to a contagious disease, their\neyes darting around to see if there were any real Green Bones in the pub who had overheard and\nwould come over to break Mudt’s legs for his blasphemy.\nQuickly, Mudt laughed loudly and smiled. He was not practiced at smiling, so it came out as an\noverly toothy grimace. “You should’ve seen the look on your faces,” he exclaimed.\n“You’re drunk,” the older girl said, not smiling at all, and pulled her friend away to rejoin their\nparty.\nMudt admitted that he might be, at that. He paid his bar tab and left before he could say anything"

The bartender had only been at this particular establishment for a month, but he had\nsharp ears and was not new to the neighborhood, not by a long shot. After Mudt was gone, he went\ninto the back of the kitchen and used the employee phone near the restroom to place a call.\nCHAPTER\n39\nA Meeting of Pillars\nA\nnden went to Port Massy International Airport with Rohn Toro to meet Kaul Hilo when he arrived.\nThe flight was an hour late. While they waited, Rohn bought a cup of coffee from the food court and\nbrowsed the spinning racks of paperbacks in the convenience store in the terminal. Anden sat in one\nof the molded yellow chairs near the gate and tried unsuccessfully to read a magazine. He hadn’t seen\nhis cousin since the day of their grandfather’s funeral, when the Pillar had essentially banished him\nfrom Janloon, and their last words to each other had been curt and painful. When Anden had phoned\nhome and spoken to Shae, explaining the situation and the Dauks’ request for assistance, the last thing\nhe had expected was for her to phone back two weeks later and tell him that Hilo was getting on a\nplane and coming to Port Massy himself.\nIt had taken another month to secure all the necessary travel papers and free up the room in\nHilo’s schedule. In the meantime, the leaves turned golden in Port Massy and the sky darkened to a\ncreamy gray. Harvest’Eves decorations went up: garlands of acorns and dried apples, dolls and\npictures of Straw Jack, rows of yellow candles in windows. Flyers and signs littered the streets and\nwalls of the city; grocers and restaurants advertised feasts of corn cake and fatted rabbit; stores\nproclaimed the year’s steepest retail discounts.\nIn Southtrap, the Crews continued to target Kekonese people and businesses. After the body of\none of Boss Kromner’s midlevel drug dealers was found floating in the Camres River, three gunmen\nburst into a restaurant where Rohn Toro was eating. The Green Bone sensed them coming and\nescaped out a back door, but whenever Anden saw Rohn now, he was almost always wearing his\nleather gloves. He was wearing them now, even here in the airport. He kept his peaked cap pulled low\nand he often paused in whatever he was doing, his eyes going momentarily distant as he cast his\nPerception about for threats.\nTo pass the time, Anden tried to engage the man in conversation. “Do you have family coming to\nvisit you over the Harvest’Eves holiday, Rohn-jen?”\nRohn looked up briefly from the travel guide he was flipping through. “My daughter is coming\nfor a few days.” Anden had not been aware that Rohn had a daughter or any family at all; he’d known\nthe man for as long as he’d known the Dauks but had instinctively treated him with a certain\nrespectful distance and so knew little about him as a person. “She’s older than you. Lives in\nEvenfield, near her mother. I’d like to see her more, but that’s up to her, not me.” Evenfield was five\nhours away by train or bus. Rohn appeared pensive for a moment, then shrugged. “Maybe there was"

But I owe the Dauks. They’re\nthe closest thing I have to family now.”\nThe flight from Janloon arrived at last, and the passengers began to disembark. Hilo and Maik\nTar were two of the first people off the plane. Anden stood up nervously and went to greet his cousin.\nThey stopped ten paces from each other, as if struck by the same simultaneous hesitation. “Kaul-jen,”\nAnden said, lowering his gaze and touching his clasped hands to his forehead in salute. He raised his\neyes again. Hilo looked slightly older than Anden remembered; his expansive energy seemed a little\nmore contained, though perhaps that was because Anden was seeing him here, in the middle of a\nbustling airport in a foreign country, where he appeared like just another jet-lagged traveler. Hilo\ncarried his jacket over one arm, and the buttons of his blue shirt were done up all the way, hiding the\njade studs on his collarbone that Anden had always seen prominently displayed. He was not smiling,\nbut as Anden watched, a reluctant softness came into Hilo’s eyes. His mouth moved in an indecisive\nway, as if torn between a painful grimace and a grin of pleasure. Hilo crossed the rest of the space\nbetween them and greeted Anden with an unrestrained embrace. “Andy,” he said, and kissed his\ncousin firmly, once on the cheek.\nA wave of unexpectedly strong relief washed over Anden and weakened his knees. The smoothly\nhumming intensity of Hilo’s jade aura so close to him was more blindingly familiar than even Hilo’s\nvoice or the smell of his clothes—the faint odor of cigarette smoke mingled with the indescribable\nspicy fragrance of Janloon that made Anden feel instantly homesick. Anden began to stammer\nsomething in reply, then he remembered his role. He stepped back and greeted Maik Tar, who also\nembraced him warmly if less exuberantly, and then he turned slightly over his shoulder and said,\n“Kaul-jen, this is Rohn Toro. He’s the…” Anden realized he didn’t know if Rohn had an official title\nin the clan, indeed, if any Green Bones besides Dauk had titles. “Think of him as the Horn. Among\nGreen Bones here in Port Massy, he’s second only to his good friend, Dauk Losunyin, whom we’re\ngoing to see.”\n“We don’t stand much on ceremony here,” Rohn said, in his usual even, wary voice, “but I’m\nhonored to welcome you to Espenia, Kaul-jen.” He began to bend into a salute, but Hilo surprised\nhim by extending his hand and shaking Rohn’s in a firm and friendly way. The two men’s gazes met\nover their jade auras, and Anden saw Hilo immediately recognize Rohn Toro in the same way Anden\nhad recognized him when he’d first walked into the room at the Dauks’ house after dinner—as a\ncertain sort of man every clan must have.\n“I’ve heard a lot about Espenia, but this is the first time I’ve been here myself,” Hilo said,"

        "text": "certain sort of man every clan must have.\n“I’ve heard a lot about Espenia, but this is the first time I’ve been here myself,” Hilo said,\nsmiling now, in a manner that was amiable and disarming yet subtly formal. “I’m a guest in this\ncountry, so I’m grateful to be welcomed and hosted by my cousin’s friends.” He nodded to Tar. “This\nis my Pillarman and brother-in-law, Maik Tar.” Rohn and Tar greeted each other with perfectly equal\nshallow salutes, like a meeting between two dogs of the same size.\n“It’s good of you to come on nothing but Anden’s word,” Rohn said to Hilo.\nThe Pillar’s smile stayed stiffly in place as he said, without looking directly at his cousin, “Andy\nwouldn’t ask me here for no reason. Who can we trust, if not our family?” and Anden knew that even\nthough Hilo was glad to see him, he was not entirely forgiven.\nAfter Hilo and Tar claimed their baggage, Rohn Toro led the way out to the short-term parking\narea and a rented black town car. Rohn explained to the visitors that Dauk Losun had arranged for\nthem to stay at the Crestwood Hotel in downtown Port Massy. Would they like to go directly there to\nrest for a while? Hilo was looking through the window with interest as Rohn drove the car out of the\nairport and onto the freeway. No, Hilo said, he’d slept on the plane and didn’t need to go to the hotel\nright away if it meant keeping another Pillar waiting; they ought to go meet with Dauk Losun now.\nRohn drove through the center of Port Massy, intentionally taking a longer route to give the\nvisitors a chance to see some of the cityscape. Hilo remained silent for much of the ride, but several\ntimes, he nudged Maik Tar and remarked on this or that interesting sight: the world-famous Mast\nBuilding, the garish orange buses, a familiar brand name on a billboard. Anden wanted to tell his\ncousin a thousand things; he felt a strange compulsion to act as a tour guide and point out tidbits that\nhe hadn’t known when he’d first arrived in Port Massy but had subsequently learned and that the\nPillar might appreciate—but he was tentative, no longer sure how familiar to act with his cousin,\nwhether his comments would be welcomed or scorned.\nAnden turned partway around in his seat and remarked, “That’s Port Massy College, Hilo-jen.\nThose arches are the entrance to the campus.” As they entered Southtrap, he said, “The place I live is\nabout three blocks that way. If you have time, maybe you could meet the Hians—they’re the couple\nwho’ve been hosting me.” Hilo did not answer, but when the car came to a stop in front of the Dauks’\nhome a few minutes later, he leaned forward and gave Anden a pat on the shoulder before opening the\ndoor and getting out. Anden stayed put for a second, feeling foolish. He’d lived in Port Massy for\nnearly two years, he’d done well in his studies, could speak and read Espenian, had a part-time job\nthat paid a reasonable wage. He had friends and a home of sorts.

He hadn’t realized until now how much he still craved his cousin’s\napproval and forgiveness. It must’ve been obvious not only to Hilo but to everyone in the car. Anden\ngot out and followed the other men.\nDauk Losun and Dauk Sana greeted the visitors at the front door. Cory was there too, home from\nWatersguard University for the two-week-long Harvest’Eves break. Fortunately, after fruitless months\nof surveillance, the police appeared to have given up on staking out the Dauks’ home, or perhaps they\ntoo were taking a holiday break. The Dauks had gone to some effort to make their modest home look\npresentable to an important visitor. The counters and the banister gleamed from polish; new, brighter\nlights had been put in over the kitchen; a vase of fresh flowers on the dining table scented the air\npleasantly. Dauk Losun was more formal than usual; instead of his typical sweater, he was wearing a\ngray shirt and a red tie with a gold clip, and he was not quite his normal unassuming self. He greeted\nKaul Hilo with a respectful salute, saying how pleased he was to meet the Pillar of the great No Peak\nclan in person and inquiring as to his flight. From behind his father’s shoulder, Cory flashed Anden a\nquick smile, which Anden barely acknowledged with one of his own before averting his gaze. He’d\nspent months impatient to see Cory again, but right now he was too unbalanced by his cousin’s\npresence and the strangeness of different parts of his life coming together under one roof.\nHilo quickly put his hosts at ease by smiling his lopsided smile, complimenting them on aspects\nof their house, and joking about the food served on Kekon Air. As they entered the dining room,\nAnden saw his cousin’s gaze fall on the statues and vases carved from bluffer’s jade. A smirk tugged\nat the corner of Hilo’s mouth, imperceptible to anyone but Anden; it was gone in an instant. When\nDauk Losun brought out a bottle of fine hoji and opened it to serve in advance of dinner, Hilo told\nthem about one of his Fists who’d been maimed in a battle and lost his arms but now ran one of the\nbest hoji distilleries in Janloon. Was Dauk a hoji connoisseur? Hilo would be pleased to send him a\ncase. Maik and Rohn stood silently near their bosses, watching the exchange and each other with\nrespect and subtle caution.\nDauk Sana, wearing a high-collared, matronly green dress, brought out dish after dish of food to\nthe dinner table, apologizing for the meagerness of the meal even though it was obvious that she’d\nbeen slaving in the kitchen all day to cook a dozen dishes. Hilo said that his own mother could not\nhave done so well, which made Dauk Sana beam with pleasure. “I had plans to make one other\nseafood dish and a sweet cake, and I would have, if my daughters had been here to help, but one lives\nfar away, another is home with a sick child, and the third is traveling for some sort of industry"

Anden felt a tremble in his stomach, a sudden, ridiculous\nprotectiveness. Hilo smiled in a teasing, friendly way and raised his hoji glass to Dauk Coru. “The\nyoungest is also the most spoiled, the one who gets away with anything.”\nCory laughed a little uncertainly and glanced at his father. “I’m not sure that’s true.”\nFrom across the table, Dauk Losun said, “Do you have children, Kaul-jen?”\nHilo said, “I have two sons. They’re one and three years old. My wife and I are expecting a third\nchild.”\nDauk Losun and Kaul Hilo were separated in age by thirty years. “The gods favor you, Kaul-jen,\nto have given you two sons already and perhaps a third on the way,” Dauk said.\n“The third will be a girl,” Hilo said. “That’s how it seems to be in our family.”\n“Nevertheless, a blessing.”\nAfter dinner, Dauk Sana cleared the empty dishes and leftovers to the kitchen. There was still\nplenty of food left; Hilo, Anden, and the Dauks had dined heartily, but Maik Tar and Rohn Toro,\nseated next to their respective Pillars, had eaten little and spoken less. It was their unstated but\nmutually understood role to remain observant and on guard. This was a friendly meeting, but\nnonetheless one between clan Pillars that did not know each other.\nCory stood up to help his mother clear the table. Anden got up as well, wanting to be helpful and\nfeeling suddenly out of place at the table of Green Bone men. In the kitchen, Cory put a stack of\ndishes on the counter and whispered, “Your cousin’s not what I expected.”\n“What did you expect?” Anden asked.\n“Someone like you but a lot older. Serious and intimidating. Black suit, sunglasses, carrying half\na dozen knives on his body. Jade on gold chains hanging off his neck and wrists.”\n“You’ve been watching too many of those idiotic Shotarian crime movies.”\nCory laughed softly, a sound that always made Anden’s heart skip a little. “Do you think he’s\nreally going to do anything to help us with the Crews, or is he here for some other reason?”\nAnden felt oddly accused, as if he was expected to know the Pillar’s mind, and it was his fault\nthe Dauks had gone to so much trouble to prepare for this evening. “I don’t know,” he said.\nDauk Sana took a fresh pot of tea back out to the dining table. “When are we going to get\ntogether?” Cory whispered, now that they were alone in the kitchen.

He put his hand on the small of\nAnden’s back and slipped his fingers under the waistband of Anden’s pants.\nAnden moved away, extricating himself. How could Cory think about that right now, with his\nparents and the Pillar of No Peak sitting in the room next to them? “Maybe Secondday,” he said,\nwhen he saw the faintly hurt expression on Coru’s face. “We’ll talk later.”\nThey went back into the dining room. Tea and cigarettes and glazed quartered plums were on the\ntable. Maik and Rohn had edged their chairs back, so that they sat slightly behind the two Pillars.\nAnden stood in the doorway for a second, unsure of where he ought to place himself, but Maik Tar\nhooked the leg of Anden’s empty chair with his foot and moved it deliberately next to his, so it was\nclear that Anden was expected to sit on the Kaul side, behind Hilo.\nAnden did so. To his surprise, Sana’s and Cory’s seats remained where they were at the table, on\neither side of Dauk Losun. Dauk said, with an air of casual explanation, “Kaul-jen, I hope you don’t\nmind if I ask my wife and son to remain a part of our conversation. We’re usually not formal around\nhere, and even though the people in our neighborhood call me Pillar, it’s more as a sign of respect\nthan an official title. Someone has to lead the community when needed. It’s my honor to hold that\nresponsibility, but I’m not ashamed to admit that most of the time I rely on the straightforward good\nsense of my wife. My son is the only one of our children who wears jade. He’s like a bee that sips\nfrom every flower—he’s known and liked by everyone, and, Heaven help me, he’s also a lawyer-in-\ntraining, so I like to keep him close.”\nAnden had rarely heard Dauk Losun speak at such length and so humbly. With this opening,\nhowever, Dauk was setting the terms of the conversation and signaling his own standing as a man of\ninfluence. He was like a leopard facing a tiger; he possessed far less jade, less wealth, and less power\nin his country than Kaul Hilo held in Kekon, but he was a Green Bone leader in his own right and not\nthe sort of man who would be pushed around by a visitor in his own home.\nHilo said solemnly, “I would never question how another Pillar runs his clan, especially not in\nanother country. I know how important it is to have good counsel on your side.”\nDauk relaxed a little. There was no denying, Anden thought, that Kaul Hilo knew how to take\nthe right tone at the right time. During the dinner he’d been the perfectly cheerful guest,\ncomplimentary, quick to smile and laugh. Now he sat almost unmoving, his attention cool and animal\nsteady. “I have a lot of questions about Espenia, Dauk-jen, and about jade in this country. Ever since I\nbecame Pillar, my attention has been focused at home. That was out of necessity. Also, I came from"

But like you, I have good counsel on my\nside, and thanks to that I’ve come to realize that jade is an international issue now, and the threats to\nKekon and the Green Bone way of life stretch from across the ocean.”\nDauk Sana said, “Many of the Kekonese in this country are from families that came here to\nescape the Shotarians. We held on to some of the old ways but sadly also lost touch with our kin back\non the island. Some families, like mine, brought jade with them, and that was never a problem\nbecause we kept to ourselves. Now it seems the world is changing and everyone is turning against\nus.”\n“We haven’t made connections with our countrymen overseas either,” Hilo said. “We Kekonese\nhave never been good at looking beyond our own shores, but my friends and my enemies have taught\nme that needs to change. That’s why I wanted to come in person to meet you, Dauk-jen, and to learn\nhow we Green Bones might help each other.”\nThree hours of intense discussion followed. The Dauks told Kaul Hilo about the secretive life led\nby Green Bones in Port Massy, explaining that they could not openly wear jade and had to train in the\ndisciplines covertly, using their abilities to handle affairs in their own community and to defend\nthemselves from the predatory Crews and on occasion the hostility and mistrust of Espenians, which\nhad only increased in recent years due to the strained relationship with Kekon over the Oortokon War\nand Espenian government propaganda about the dangers and evils of civilian jade use. They spoke of\nhow they had kept the grudge hall running for a long time by paying off the Port Massy police but\nnow the greatest threat came from the Crews, who saw the opportunity to expand their protection\nrackets, gambling, and drugs into neighborhoods that the Kekonese had long controlled—and to steal\njade.\nThe hour grew late. Dauk Sana brought out more tea and a bowl of roasted nuts. She opened the\nwindows to clear the air as the dining room grew hazy with smoke. Outside, it had turned dark some\ntime ago. Hilo asked increasingly specific questions: How many Green Bones were there in Port\nMassy? Were they organized? How many could Dauk reliably call upon if needed? What was this\nBoss Kromner like? What about his foreman, Skinny Reams? How many coats did he command?\nWhat were their main businesses? Who were their rivals? This was a side of Kaul Hilo that Anden\nknew about but had not witnessed in person before: the mind of a Horn at work.\nAnden saw Cory slide slowly lower into his chair and his eyes lose focus, his attention drifting\nlike a bored student in a college lecture hall. His mother prodded him to sit up, and he excused\nhimself to go to the bathroom before taking it upon himself to wash and dry the dishes in the kitchen.\nAnden heard him running the water and clattering about in the other room, and stifled a flash of\nannoyance.

Dauk Losun did not\npublicly scold his son or order him back into the discussion, but Anden saw the man’s mouth press\ntogether in disappointment.\nAt last, Hilo said, “I’d like to meet these Bosses. All of them, together, in one room.”\nDauk Losun was silent for a minute. Then he spoke with obvious concern. “Kaul-jen, I doubt\nthat’ll be possible. Even if you could trick them into such a thing—and I don’t think you could—the\nlaws are extremely strict about violence, even against criminals who deserve it. It would be too risky\nand costly for you personally as well as for the Kekonese community. If anything were to happen to\nthe Bosses at this meeting, the Crews would retaliate against all of us, including against innocent\npeople in Southtrap.”\nHilo leaned back in his chair. “My friend, what do you think I’m planning to do? Kill all the\nBosses myself?” It was apparent, in the following moment of uncomfortable silence, that was exactly\nwhat Dauk had thought. A faint smile played over Hilo’s lips; he seemed amused that despite being a\nGreen Bone himself, Dauk had been so quick to jump to assumptions based on the stereotype of the\nKekonese as instinctively violent.\nHilo broke the awkward moment with a shake of the head. “My Weather Man had to get a\nspecial government waiver for me to even visit the country wearing jade. I’m not allowed to stay in\nEspenia for more than twenty days; I had to declare every piece of green I carried in and I’ll have to\ncarry the same amount out.” He shook his head again in amazement. “I can see how different things\nare here, and I don’t intend to cause problems for myself. More importantly, it’s not my place to\nwhisper names or to take lives in another Pillar’s territory, not when I respect him and would like to\nremain his friend.” He smiled to show that he had not been at all offended by what Dauk had said.\n“There’s a lot you can learn about people when you’re in the same room with them. That’s why I\nwant to meet the Bosses. Or rather, for you to meet with them. I’m only a guest here.”\nDauk Sana spoke up. “Kromner will be suspicious. There’s been killing and property damage on\nboth sides for months now. They’ve caused us problems, but we’re not helpless, especially because\nwe have Rohn-jen. Why would the Bosses agree to sit down with us now?”\nHilo said, “I know something of clan war, and one thing I know is that they’re fought on many\nlevels. The war on the street between Fingers goes on in one way, but the war that happens over\ntelephone calls, and in closed rooms, and in tall buildings—that goes on in another way.

He’ll be interested to meet with us.”\nSana was disbelieving. “Are you truly willing to negotiate with the Crews over jade?”\n“We’ll see about that.” For the first time that night, Hilo looked at his watch. “We have more to\ntalk about, and a lot more to plan, but it’s getting late.” He stood up; Tar and Anden stood with him.\n“Thank you for a delicious meal, Mrs. Dauk. We’ll meet again tomorrow; I’ll buy dinner this time.\nYou’ll have to suggest where we should go for good Espenian food—I want to try some while I’m\nhere.” Hilo was his casual self again; the meeting was over.\nThe Dauks stood up and saw them to the door. “Rohn-jen is at your disposal while you’re here,”\nDauk said. “He’ll take you to the hotel.” Hilo accepted graciously. Rohn said he would drive Anden\nhome as well. With a backward glance at Cory, Anden got into the town car.\nWhen they pulled up in front of the Crestwood Hotel, Hilo said to Anden, “Come inside and\nhave a drink with us at the bar, Andy. I’ll pay for a taxi to take you home afterward.”\nWith a parting nod to Rohn Toro, Anden got out of the car and followed Hilo and Tar into the\nlobby of the hotel. The bar was almost empty; people were spending the night before Harvest’Eves at\nhome with family. The Pillar dropped into an armchair behind one of the empty tables while Tar went\nto the bar to order them drinks. Hilo took off his suit jacket and threw it onto another seat, then undid\nthe top two buttons of his shirt. Green glinted under his unfastened collar, capturing motes of light\nfrom the bar’s chandelier lamps. He rubbed a hand across his face; he looked exhausted now, when\nminutes ago he’d shown no sign of fatigue. “Sit down, Andy,” he said, and Anden did so, taking the\nseat across from his cousin.\nHilo shifted onto one hip; he took out his wallet and removed a couple of small photographs,\nwhich he passed to Anden. “Your nephews,” he said, pride and affection lightening his voice despite\nthe jet lag that was obviously crashing over him fast. “They’re getting big. They fight sometimes, but\nall brothers fight.” In one of the photos, Wen was holding both the boys on her lap on the bench under\nthe tree in the Kaul courtyard; in the other, the boys were squeezed together riding a large toy car, Ru\nin front, Niko behind. Niko was much larger than he was in the last photograph Anden had seen. He\nlooked happy and robust, more like Lan than ever.\n“I told them they have an uncle going to school in another country, and that they’ll get to meet\nhim someday. Ru’s too young to understand, but Niko does.” Hilo sounded more tired by the minute.\n“Keep the photos; I brought them for you. Shae never sends the latest ones.”"

Shae never sends the latest ones.”\nAnden looked at the photos another minute, then put them in his own wallet. Tar came back with\ndrinks. “I don’t know what this is,” he said. “I just pointed to the most expensive-looking bottle\nbehind the bar and asked for three glasses.” It was brandy, they discovered upon tasting it. “Well, how\nabout that,” Tar said, smacking his lips. “A bit sweet, but not half bad.”\n“Here we are,” said Hilo, “together on the other side of the world.” He drank from his glass, then\nleaned his head back against the cushioned chair and closed his eyes for a minute. When he opened\nthem again, he turned his chin toward Anden. For a moment he didn’t speak, then he said, quietly,\n“You look good, cousin. Not as pale and underfed as I worried you might be. Tell me how you’re\ndoing, what you’ve been up to these past couple of years.”\nCHAPTER\n40\nThe Bosses\nD\nauk Losun sent Rohn Toro as an emissary to Blaise “the Bull” Kromner with a request for a\nmeeting, to be held as soon as possible, between Dauk and the three most powerful Crew Bosses in\nthe city of Port Massy. Rohn was instructed to make it clear that the Kekonese had had enough of the\nongoing harassment in Southtrap and wished to sue for peace. To demonstrate his sincerity, Dauk was\nwilling to meet at a time and place of Kromner’s choosing, bringing only three attendants with him to\nthe parley, with no additional guarantee for his own safety.\nWhen Rohn returned, he told the Dauks and Kaul Hilo that Kromner had agreed to secure the\nattendance of the other two Bosses for a meeting on high ground between all the parties on Jons\nIsland the following Firstday at dawn. Driving across the Iron Eye Bridge in the early morning, Hilo\ninquired as to the reason for Kromner’s specific choice of time and place.\n“Firstdawn is the holy hour for Truthbearers,” Dauk explained from the front passenger seat,\nglancing at Hilo and Tar in the rearview mirror. “That’s when they say the Seer ended the Seven Year\nWalk at the top of Mount Icana and the One Truth was revealed to him. No sin that’s committed on\nhigh ground at Firstdawn can be forgiven by God. It’s the safest time to meet.”\n“Don’t they know we’re not a part of their church?” Tar scoffed.\n“It’s not us the Bosses are concerned about,” Rohn Toro replied as he drove. “We’ll be unarmed\nand outnumbered to the point that even jade wouldn’t even the odds. They’re suspicious of each\nother. The Southside Crew is strongest, but the Baker Street and Wormingwood Crews put together\nwould be larger than Kromner’s organization. They’ll all be on good behavior, though; the Espenians\nare more religious than you’d think. Anyone who sheds blood at Firstdawn would be turned on by all"

Anyone who sheds blood at Firstdawn would be turned on by all\nthe others, not just in Port Massy, but all across the country and by the Bosses Table itself. And they’d\nlose all their paid influence with the police and the courts.”\n“It’s like bringing in penitents,” Tar observed. “Funny, isn’t it? No matter where you are in the\nworld, the one thing that keeps men from killing each other is a fear of what’ll happen after they’re\ndead.” He chuckled and looked to his Pillar, as if hoping for some affirming response, but Hilo\nremained silent, gazing out the window as they drove past the amusement park, aquarium, and pier-\nside attractions of Guildman’s Park—none of them open at this early hour—and then up a hill to\nThorick Mansion, the historical pirate baron’s house turned social club that was widely known to\nhave Crew connections, as evidenced now by the fact that it had been opened and made available to\nthe Bosses at this unusual time.\nRohn parked some distance away from half a dozen large, hulking luxury cars—including, Hilo\nnoticed, a Duchesse Priza of the same model year as his own. Several men in black hats and long\ncoats stood by the doors, and Hilo Perceived many more inside and around the building, all of them\nno doubt well armed. Before they got out of the car, Hilo said to Tar in a low aside, “Remember,\nDauk is in charge of this meeting. The Espenians don’t know who the two of us are, and it’s better to\nkeep it that way, so keep your jade out of sight.”\nHe’d noticed his Pillarman feeling his bare fingers and wrists on the drive over. Tar had placed\nall his jade on a chain that was hanging around his neck under his clothes; not wearing it in its usual\nplace was clearly agitating him. Green Bones often had small physical mannerisms—twisting the\nrings on their fingers, straightening their shirt cuffs, touching or tugging at their collar—subtle\nmovements to draw attention to their green when interacting with other people. It was hard to notice\nand quell such unconscious habits. Hilo’s own jade was hidden under his uncomfortably buttoned-up\nshirt and tie. Even though they were going to meet with foreign gangsters that Hilo considered almost\nas low as Zapunyo, he didn’t like the feeling of dishonesty it gave him to be covering up his status\nand identity, as if he were wearing a mask. The ways things worked here, the prevailing culture of\nconcealment… no wonder there was so much crime in this country.\nThey got out of the car and walked to the front of the mansion. The guards stopped them and\npatted them down for weapons. Tar looked affronted at this indignity, but when Hilo spread his arms\nand submitted without objection, his Pillarman did the same. The coats paid them only cursory\nattention, but they glared at Rohn Toro with hateful unease, putting hands on their guns and keeping\nsome distance from him.

Hilo noticed it, and it improved his estimation of both Rohn and Dauk. He\ndidn’t think of Dauk as a real Pillar any more than the mayor of Janloon would consider the headman\nof Opia village to be an equal in rank, but it was a sign of the older man’s competence that he had the\nfriendship and loyalty of a deputy who was so obviously feared.\nOne of the coats led them inside. Crystal chandeliers hung from the mansion’s ceiling and\nornately carved furniture rested on rich rugs illuminated by the early morning light that filtered\nthrough leaded windows. The air had the musty smell common to wealthy, old buildings. They\nwalked into a room with a heavy oak conference table in the center and oil paintings of famous Port\nMassy tycoons decorating the walls. On one side of the table sat five men and one woman. Half a\ndozen coats acting as bodyguards for their respective Bosses were positioned near the walls or doors,\nstanding in a relaxed manner but with their hands resting on their hips or in their pockets in such a\nway that their pistols were visible, watching the new entrants but also each other. The Kekonese were\nthe last to arrive. This had obviously been by design; the Crew Bosses were bringing in Dauk the way\na council of kings would receive a foreign emissary. Hilo waited for Dauk Losun to sit down in one of\nthe empty chairs at the table before taking the seat next to him.\nBlaise “the Bull” Kromner had been born into a childhood of poverty, and though he was now well\nfed and vain, his enemies would be unwise to forget that he had worked his way up through the Port\nMassy underworld with absolute ruthlessness and cunning, eliminating many rivals along the way.\nTrue to his moniker, Kromner was a beefy man with a heavily fleshed face and a reddish complexion.\nHis features were crude, as if a sculptor had formed them in a hurry, pressing in two shallow thumb\ndents for eyes and attaching a rough lump of clay for a nose. In contrast to his natural ugliness,\nKromner was impeccably dressed. His tailored pinstripe suit and vest fit his broad frame perfectly.\nThe mustache over his broad lips was trimmed and his thick brown hair was neatly combed. He wore\na gold watch with a crystal face and a red silk tie. The Bull controlled the gambling and prostitution\nsouth of the Camres and a substantial amount of the drug trade. Only the cartels from Tomascio in\nWest Spenda that held sway on narcotics elsewhere in the country competed with him. Kromner was\nthe most famous Crew Boss in the country and liked to be photographed by the newspapers when he\nappeared at expensive clubs, attended the theater, and dined at the finest restaurants. He was well\ninsulated by layers in his organization, and although his word was law in the Southside Crew, he left\nmuch of the day-to-day operations to his trusted foremen.\nKromner was seated in the center chair at the table; to his leftmost side was a short, stocky man\nknown as Joren Gasson. “Jo Boy” ran the Baker Street Crew that controlled the more affluent"

Gasson was a round-faced man with a shrewd, squinty expression, and he was known\nfor being stingy and private, maintaining a low profile and rarely appearing in public. He had the\nmost policemen, politicians, and judges on his payroll, and so all the other Crews frequently went to\nhim and paid him for his influence in society. The use of Thorick Mansion was on account of his\nconnections.\nOn the right side of the table was a matronly woman with a white scarf around her throat and a\ncap that sat atop very curly hair. Anga Slatter looked like someone’s rich but shrewish aunt, but she\nwas the de facto acting Boss of the Wormingwood Crew ever since her husband, Rickart “Sharp\nRicky” Slatter had been sent to jail on charges of money laundering. It was said that she acted in\nRicky’s stead in all things and communicated his decisions after visiting and consulting with him in\nprison. The Wormingwood Crew controlled the northwest of the city and its inner suburbs. All the\nother Bosses in the country had lost respect for Sharp Ricky for being so stupid as to get caught on\nminor charges, and for having no better system of management than to let his wife run the business.\nAccordingly, they paid Anga Slatter little heed.\nEach of the Bosses had brought one of their foremen with them. Kromner’s foreman, Willy\n“Skinny” Reams, sat on his Boss’s left-hand side. In contrast to Kromner, he was lean and bland\nlooking, clean shaven, in a charcoal-gray suit, holding his brimmed felt hat in his hands.\nKromner watched with arrogant curiosity as the Kekonese men entered. When everyone was\nseated, he swept his hand around the table as if in general introduction to everyone assembled. Then\nhe spoke to his fellow Bosses. “You all know of the trouble I’ve been having in Southtrap with the\nKekonese.” Kromner was naturally a fast, animated speaker, and his voice was higher than one\nwould’ve expected for so large a man. “Now I’m aware this doesn’t affect any of the rest of you\ndirectly, so you’re likely asking yourselves why Bully Blaise has put you to the trouble of coming all\nthe way out to Jons Island on a whip crack, at Firstdawn over Harvest’Eves holidays no less.” He\npaused as if waiting for someone to validate this assertion by asking the question out loud. When no\none did, Kromner lifted a finger anyway and said, “This little dispute is about more than a few broken\nskulls in K-Town. It’s about the jade business. There’s big money to be accounted here, and that’s a\nmatter concerning all of us Bosses.” Kromner turned toward the Kekonese and took a second to study\nthe four men before picking out Dauk Losun. “Mr. Dauk here is who the Kekonese think of as their\nown boss. He’s asked to meet with us to work out an agreement.”"

        "text": "the four men before picking out Dauk Losun. “Mr. Dauk here is who the Kekonese think of as their\nown boss. He’s asked to meet with us to work out an agreement.”\nAll eyes turned toward the oldest Kekonese man, who sat with his elbows on the table, hands\nlightly clasped and his back stiff, clearly ill at ease at being the center of attention. Dauk cleared his\nthroat and spoke in Espenian with a slight accent. “For many years, the Kekonese community has had\nan understanding with the Bosses. We each mind our own businesses. No matter how long we’ve\nbeen here or even if we were born in Port Massy, we Kekonese are still seen as unwelcome strangers\nin this country. We stick to our own affairs. We want to be good citizens, respected members of\nEspenian society. At the same time, we hold strongly to our traditions, and we ask only that they not\nbe interfered with by outsiders. So we don’t seek to interfere in anything that you do, and in\nexchange, we handle our own matters. This has applied particularly in the areas of gambling,\nprotection money, and of course, jade.”\nJo Gasson said, in a reedy voice, “That’s not the case anymore, is it? You’ve opened up your\ngambling halls to the regular people, who’re putting down money on cockfighting or dueling instead\nof racing or slots. That competes with Boss Kromner’s businesses directly.”\n“It’s true, we’ve opened the grudge hall to outsiders on certain days of the week,” Dauk said.\n“But it’s by invitation only. It’s only natural that our children would make Espenian friends and marry\ninto Espenian families, and it’s no longer fair to say those who aren’t a hundred percent Kekonese\nshouldn’t be allowed to be part of our community gatherings. On those days when we open up the\nhall, we have cockfighting and gambling only, no duels. The fee we charge goes toward maintaining\nour community center and helping those in our neighborhood who need help. We’re not making any\neffort to draw people away from your establishments.”\n“That’s not the main issue here,” Kromner said with obvious impatience. “I’m a generous man,\nand I’m willing to let go of small money if all you kecks were up to was a little gambling. But your\nnot-so-secret halls aren’t just cheap entertainment; they’re where you people go to show off your jade\nand practice your fancy moves. You’re running the only jade markets in town, and that’s not right.\nThe jade business is too big for you to have to yourselves.”\nA flush of anger came into Dauk’s face, but he spoke calmly. “Jade is our cultural heritage. Our\nfamilies brought it with them to this country and we keep it within our community. We don’t sell it for\nprofit. And now, with the government ban and negative public perception, we’ve all the more reason\nto keep our jade hidden, so as not to attract the attention of law enforcement. It’s bad publicity for the\nKekonese community when someone is caught selling jade or a non-Kekonese person commits\ncrimes using jade or comes down with the Itches. That’s why we train to use our green, and we police"

That’s why we train to use our green, and we police\nour own if there are any problems.”\n“Oh, you make yourselves sound quite innocent,” said Anga Slatter, raising thin, well-plucked\neyebrows. “As if you people haven’t attacked Blaise’s bookies, or murdered his coats.”\nKromner made a huffing noise of appreciative agreement, but Dauk said, “There’ve been\noffenses on both sides; I’m not saying otherwise. But the main issue is that the peaceful\nunderstanding we’ve had for many years has broken down. The police attention is bad for all of us,\nbut there are fewer of us Kekonese and we’re not as powerful or influential as the Crews. We know\nwe’re not in a position to go up against you. That’s why I’ve come here to petition you.”\n“Well, get on with it and say what you’re offering.” Kromner frowned, the ample flesh of his\ncheeks pulling down his eyes at the corners as they slid for the first time over to the younger man\nsitting next to Dauk, who hadn’t spoken at all thus far. “And who’s this you’ve got with you? Doesn’t\nhe talk at all?”\nDauk said, “Kaul Hiloshudon is a representative of one of the Green Bone clans in Kekon. He’s\ncome from Janloon at my request.” The Bosses looked at the stranger next to Dauk with interest now.\nHe was young, in his early thirties, though Kromner had a hard time guessing when it came to the\nKekonese. He was looking back and forth attentively between the speakers during the conversation,\nand he was apparently important enough to travel with his own bodyguard, an equally young, tough-\nlooking man who stood near the wall behind him. Kromner had to admit that there was something to\nbe said for the kecks. They were a proud race, a don’t-fuck-with-me race; the women looked haughty\nand the men looked like they would put a knife in your side for the fun of it if you looked at them the\nwrong way. Blaise Kromner liked that about the kecks; they didn’t lie down easily, that was for sure,\nwhich was why he had to break their monopoly on jade or wipe their gemstone-toting toughs out of\nthe city.\nDauk said something to the man next to him. The visitor nodded, then sat forward and began\nspeaking in Kekonese, pausing frequently so that Dauk could translate his words into Espenian. “I\nunderstand that your organization wants to get in on the international jade market,” said the young\nman. “Kekon is the only place on earth to get jade, and it’s controlled by the Green Bone clans;\nanyone who wants to trade in green has to go through them. I come from one of the most powerful\nclans in my country and have complete authority to negotiate an agreement.”\nKromner looked to Dauk. “You’re saying this fellow can sell us jade?”\nDauk nodded slowly. “I will act as the go-between in this deal, but I don’t want any share of it"

You can get jade straight from Kekon, and the price for my part in this is that we\nreestablish the peace in Port Massy. If the Crews agree to leave us complete control over our part of\nSouthtrap, including the freedom to run all our businesses and our grudge halls as we see fit, then we\ncan broker a new agreement that benefits everyone.”\n“That sounds reasonable to me, Blaise,” said Jo Boy Gasson, who had nothing at risk in\nSouthtrap but was sure to benefit from the legal and political graft that would inevitably be necessary\nin such a venture. Kromner ignored him and said, with a strong hint of suspicion in his voice as he\nlooked from Kaul to Dauk, “I thought you people didn’t sell jade to outsiders.”\nDauk made a face that looked rather pained, then spoke again in Kekonese to the man next to\nhim. Kaul replied and Dauk relayed his words. “That used to be true. It’s admirable that our\ncountrymen abroad are able to stick to tradition and keep jade to themselves. Often it’s the\nimmigrants that hold on to the old ways while those of us in Kekon have to keep pace with the\nchanging times. The truth is, my clan is in a long-standing war with another clan and we need the\nmoney. They’ve been selling jade and shine in Ygutan and so they have the advantage over us. We\nneed our own markets.” The visitor waited patiently as Dauk caught up in the translation. “Any\nagreement we come to today would have to involve an entirely secure transaction. Our confidentiality\nhas to be guaranteed. You see, the government of Kekon sells jade to the Espenian military, and it\nwould be bad for my clan, which has ties within the government, to be selling jade to the Crews at the\nsame time.”\nKromner waved a hand as if to dispel the concern. “That’s not a problem, we can promise that,”\nhe said quickly. “How much could you sell to us, and at what price?”\nThe visitor said, “That depends on whether it’s raw or cut. There’s a state cartel—the Kekon\nJade Alliance—that strictly regulates how much jade is mined and processed in Kekon. So there’s a\ntight supply of cut jade, and it’s very expensive. Raw jade can be smuggled out of the mines, so you’d\nget much more for your money, but it’s useless unless you have workers who can carve and polish it.”\nBoss Kromner addressed his foreman for the first time. “Skinny, what do you think?”\n“I think we can easily rustle up enough migrant laborers, Boss,” Reams said.\nDauk said, with concern, “Jade is dangerous for non-Kekonese to handle.”\n“We know that,” Kromner retorted. “You think I’d go into a business without knowing anything\nabout it, without doing my research? It was Espenia that created shine, not your country. With all the\nsoldiers in Oortoko and the war vets that’ll need the drugs, you don’t think we can get SN1? If Skinny"

If Skinny\nsays we can get the labor, it’ll be no problem to keep them doped.”\nDauk conveyed this to the Kekonese clan representative, who said, “Raw jade, then. So long as\nyou understand that the quality varies naturally in any given amount of uncut rock. Usually, you can\nexpect about a thirty to fifty percent yield of cut jade.” Kaul leaned his arms on the table. “The market\nrate these days is ten million thalirs per kilogram.”\nGod, Seer, and Truth, that amount of money made even the Southside Crew’s lucrative narcotics\ntrade look like small money. Even Blaise the Bull Kromner could not enter into such an expensive\nventure on his own, and before answering the Kekonese, he said to the other Bosses, “Now you know\nI’m getting into this for serious money. I’m not asking either the Baker Street or Wormingwood\nCrews to be a part of Southside’s business, but we can all see it’s serious money. If you want to be\ninvolved, now’s the time to speak. If you don’t, then feel free to say so, but I expect the old crewboy’s\ncourtesies that we leave each other to eat well.”\nJo Boy Gasson smoothed his tie and said, “My Crew isn’t interested in handling jade ourselves.\nToo risky, and too much heat. We’re bookmakers, not fighters, you all know that. But we can front the\nmoney and handle all the financing in exchange for the usual cut. And we can pay the people who\nneed to be paid to look the other way.” It was exactly what Kromner had expected, indeed it would’ve\nbeen difficult to proceed without it; he nodded in ready agreement.\nAnga Slatter said, “Blaise, you know Ricky is going to expect that the Wormingwood Crew\nshould have at least part of the action in this. If we’re talking about smuggling jade into the country\nfrom across the ocean, well, any shipments that come in or out of the city go through the ports, and\nwe control the dockworkers unions. So let’s figure a fifteen percent cut, in exchange for getting the\ngoods safely through the harbor. I have to clear all this with Ricky, of course,” she added, “but I’ll\nturn on the wifely charms, and I’m sure he’ll agree if you do.”\nKromner was disinclined to give any percent to that fool Sharp Ricky or his woman, but he\nthought about it and decided that fifteen percent was reasonable to guarantee the Wormingwood\nCrew’s cooperation and prevent him from having to spend his own people’s time and energy on\ngetting the goods through the harborfront. Kromner entertained longer-term thoughts about taking\nover Wormingwood completely, after he’d established himself in the jade trade and the Southside\nCrew was large and strong enough to make the expansion. So he intended to get the percentage back\neventually and didn’t quibble over it now. “Tell Ricky it’s fine by me.”\nThroughout this discussion, Mr. Dauk and his Kekonese guest waited, the older man with a\nslightly anxious frown, the younger looking at the Bosses and their foremen with a strangely"

        "text": "Throughout this discussion, Mr. Dauk and his Kekonese guest waited, the older man with a\nslightly anxious frown, the younger looking at the Bosses and their foremen with a strangely\nunmoving, but slightly off-center gaze, as if he was concentrating on something else while the\nEspenians talked. Kromner squinted at the man, then turned to Dauk and said, “Tell your friend that\nI’ll pay him seven hundred million thalirs for a hundred kilos of jade rock.”\nDauk’s mouth puckered as if he’d eaten something sour. He relayed the Boss’s words to his\nguest in an apologetic tone. To Kromner’s surprise, the younger man did not appear offended or\nthrown off by the low offer; he brought his attention back and smiled. “In my country, it’s the honor\nof an alliance that’s important. The leaders assign people they trust to work out the details in a fair\nmanner.”\n“Well, we’re not in your country, are we?” Kromner said. “Seven hundred.” He’d hoped to put\nhimself in a stronger negotiating position by making the Kekonese uncomfortable, and was\ndisappointed when the visitor gave a shrug.\n“Everyone wants jade. I could sell to the Shotarians or the Ygutanians with less hassle, but I’m\nwilling to come all the way here because of my Kekonese friends in Espenia who want to get along\nwith you. Nine hundred.”\nThey settled, after some predictable back and forth, on eight hundred million thalirs for a\nhundred kilograms of raw jade to be delivered in four equal shipments so as to spread out the risk of it\nbeing intercepted by Espenian authorities. Kaul explained that everything would be handled through\nintermediaries and the jade would be transported via cargo carrier ships that were not owned or\nregistered by anyone with ties to the Kekonese clans. All communication going forward would be\npassed through Dauk Losun or those in his confidence.\nKromner was pleased with how smoothly everything had proceeded. Let the Kekonese have\ntheir area of Southtrap and their gambling halls, which were of little consequence; in the whole\ncountry of Espenia, only his Crew now had a supply of jade straight from the source. Already\nKromner was thinking of the fortune he would make on the black market. Of course he would keep\nsome of the jade to equip his own foremen and coats. The Southside Crew would become more\npowerful than any of the others; perhaps he would be making a move to take over Wormingwood\nsooner than he’d planned. After all, it wasn’t as if Sharp Ricky could do a good job running his\nbusiness from prison. Kromner would give the Slatters’ territory to one of his foremen—Skinny\nReams or Moth Duke, perhaps. Skinny was more competent, there was no question of that, but he\nwas too independently minded; he might well take what Kromner gave him and break off his own\nCrew. Moth wasn’t smart enough to entertain any complex thoughts, so he was more trustworthy.\nThe Kekonese man, Kaul, was still looking between the Bosses and speaking.

        "text": "surprisingly amiable and nonchalant, not like the serious Mr. Dauk or that killer, Rohn. Kromner was\nnot one to take anything at face value, however. He suspected that Kaul was merely a front man,\nsomeone young and easy to deal with, sent by those dangerous men who held the real power on that\nmysterious island. Kromner had never been anywhere near Kekon, but his imaginings included a\nshadowy council of elders, elaborate rituals, jade swords.\nAgain, Dauk translated Kaul’s words. “Since you’re foreigners, I feel I should tell you: Jade isn’t\nlike your drugs or guns, which can be easily used by weak men. In Kekon, we say that jade can make\nmen into gods. Only the strong can wield it. You’re going to have to move a lot of jade safely and\nsecretly, making sure that it doesn’t get into the hands of street hoodlums in your own territories, or\nspirited away by your own low-level people hoping to make extra money. Who’s going to be\nresponsible for making sure that the jade is handled properly?”\nKromner did not like the whiff of condescension he sensed in the Kekonese man’s words and the\nway the visitor was now sitting, leaning back in his chair with a slightly hooded expression. Kromner\nsaid, “No street punk or coat in my Crew would dare skim from Southside. Not unless they wanted to\ntake a river cruise with no boat.” Anga Slatter smiled, and Jo Gasson grimaced, but the Kekonese\ndidn’t react. “I personally guarantee it,” Kromner said.\nKaul shook his head. “Your word as a Boss is important of course, but it’s obvious you’re too\nimportant to be doing the unpleasant work in the streets yourself.” He gestured toward Kromner as if\nindicating his fine clothes and hefty body. “In a Kekonese clan, the person who would handle the\ndangerous work is called the Horn. He has to be completely loyal, respected by the men he\ncommands, and feared by the clan’s enemies. He would be the one trusted to lead should anything\nhappen to his boss. I’m asking if you have someone like that in your Crew, because you’ll need to put\nthat person in charge of the jade.”\nKromner jabbed a finger at the man. “Listen, I like doing business with you just fine, but I don’t\nneed you kecks to give me advice on how to run my own Crew. Have you personally ever had to keep\nan organization of hundreds of people in line?” When the Kekonese man didn’t answer, Kromner\nsaid, “I didn’t think so. So let me tell you something: I didn’t get to be the Boss of Southside by\nhaving incompetent men under me. Willy Reams here is the man for the job.”\nKaul studied Willy with interest, then he turned toward Dauk. The two Kekonese men had an\nextended conversation in their own language. “What’s he saying?” Kromner demanded.\nDauk cleared his throat and said, “He’s concerned about jade getting out into the streets and\nhurting innocent people, especially women and children. It’s against their code of honor, you see. So"

It’s against their code of honor, you see. So\nhe’s asking whether Mr. Reams really is the top foreman in Port Massy—how long he’s been with\nyou, how well he can fight, how many men he’s killed in combat. I told him Mr. Reams has a\nreputation, but I wouldn’t know for sure.” Dauk spread his hands. “What can I say? My friend is from\nthe old country—all they respect is personal strength and violence.”\nWilly fiddled uncomfortably with the hat in hands, but Kromner snorted. “Well, tell him not to\nworry his little keck head. Jo, Anga—tell him that my word and my men are dependable.”\nJo Gasson said, “Everyone knows that Skinny Reams from Southside is as tough as they get and\nruns the tightest ship in town.” And Anga Slatter nodded and said, “That’s the truth.”\nDauk repeated these words to Kaul, who looked at Reams again with intense assessment. Then\nhe nodded. “That’s what I’ve heard as well, through my own sources. I’m a stranger in this country\nand am taking a big risk with this deal on behalf of my clan, so forgive me if I seem pushy with all\nmy questions.” The clan representative spread his hands. “I’m happy with our arrangement.”\nAfter leaving Thorick Mansion, Rohn Toro drove Hilo, Tar, and Dauk back to Dauk’s house, where\nSana had prepared a lunch for all of them. The dining room of the house did not feel as cramped with\nonly the five of them around the table. Dauk’s son was out with friends, and Anden was either with\nhim or working an extra holiday shift at the hardware store.\nHilo could tell that Tar wanted to ask questions, but the Pillarman knew his manners and didn’t\nvoice them aloud during a meal with clan outsiders. Hilo did his best to make idle conversation, but\nhe had a headache from getting up before dawn and straining his Perception all morning. He hadn’t\nunderstood everything that had been said between the foreigners at the meeting, but he’d observed\nevery expression and gesture, the way the foreigners sat in relation to each other and their tone of\nvoice, and he’d carefully Perceived the heartbeat, pulse, breath, and bodily twitches signaling subtle\nturns of emotion during the conversation. So even though his Espenian was not up to Shae’s level, he\nfelt that he understood the people he was dealing with.\nHe was glad he’d decided to come to Port Massy himself instead of sending his Weather Man; as\nsmart as his sister was, sometimes she lacked a certain awareness when it came to connecting with\npeople, striking the proper note with potential friends or potential enemies. Later today, Hilo planned\nto meet with Hami Tumashon, so the Master Luckbringer would know that even this far from\nJanloon, he still had the clan’s support and the Pillar’s notice. There was nothing more important than\npersonal relationships; they were what made clan oaths real and not merely words that could be\nspoken by anyone.\nHilo glanced at his watch; it was too late to phone home to Janloon.

Wen and the kids were sure\nto already be in bed.\nWhen the meal was over, an expectant pause fell over the table. Hilo pushed back in his chair\nand said, “Dauk-jen, will you take a walk with me around the neighborhood? I haven’t seen much of\nSouthtrap yet, but my cousin tells me there’s a toy store down the street where I can pick up some\nsouvenirs for my sons.”\nDauk rose from his seat, and the others moved chairs out of the way so the two Pillars could step\nout of the house and talk alone. The air outside was bracing, sharp in a way that stung the nostrils.\nHilo cupped a hand around his cigarette as he lit it, then offered one to Dauk, who declined politely,\nsaying that he was trying to quit. As they strolled down the street, Hilo said, “You look puzzled,\nDauk-jen. I’m guessing you have some questions on your mind.”\nDauk said, “I’m trying to figure out your purpose for being here, Kaul-jen.”\n“My cousin called in a favor from the clan on behalf of the family that’s hosting him, to help you\nagainst the Crews. The deal we made this morning means that Boss Kromner gets the jade he wants\nand will leave you and your community alone. Isn’t that what you hoped for?”\n“It’s not the solution I expected,” Dauk replied. “Selling jade to the Southside Crew might\nsatisfy Kromner for a while, but the Bull is a greedy man, not someone who’s ever content with what\nhe has, always seeking to have more money and power.”\nHilo nodded. “A man like that can’t hide what he is,” he said. “A dog that was once starved will\nbark at anyone who comes near his food, no matter how much he has now. And he suspects everyone\nelse to be the same way. Kromner’s men follow him out of greed or fear, but no one loves a leader\nwho cares only for his own meal.”\nDauk slowed his pace. “I’ve done my homework on you and your family, Kaul-jen. No Peak has\nconsistently opposed the sale of jade to foreigners. Yet today you agreed to sell jade from your clan’s\nown stores to the Crews, who are nothing but criminals. I’m told you have a reputation as a fierce and\nuncompromising man, but you gave the Bosses exactly what they wanted.”\nHilo slowed alongside Dauk and said, “You were expecting a more dramatic and permanent\nsolution.”\n“When I was growing up in Kekon,” Dauk said slowly, “the One Mountain Society could\nwhisper the name of anyone. Even the highest Shotarian officials, police captains, generals.”\n“That’s true,” Hilo replied. “But as you’ve said before, this isn’t Kekon. A couple of years ago, I\nspilled blood in the Uwiwa Islands and it ended up being a problem, as my sister is still quick to\nremind me. Now it’s impossible for me or my Fists to get inside that country to deal with our enemies"

Now it’s impossible for me or my Fists to get inside that country to deal with our enemies\nthere. My Weather Man would have my head if I made the same mistake in Espenia.” He smiled\nwryly and said, “So we have to deal with this in a different way.”\n“Then why make the trip all the way from Janloon personally? You could’ve sent a\nrepresentative of your clan to negotiate a deal if selling jade was your intention all along.”\n“That was never my only intention.” Hilo sped up again; he wanted to get out of the cold. “The\nclans in Kekon have been fighting illegal jade smuggling for years. My Horn and his Fists have\nconfiscated thousands of kilos of raw jade scrap stolen from the country’s mines and en route to be\nshipped offshore by shine-addicted rockfish. Some of it is usable, but a lot of it is of too low a quality\nto be worth the cost of carving and polishing. Maybe some of it could go to schools or temples for\ntraining purposes, but the last thing any Green Bone wants is flawed jade that might weaken his\nabilities at a crucial moment.”\nHilo stopped in front of the toy store and looked in the window, grinding out his cigarette. “Most\nforeigners, though, unless they’re Espenian military specialists, don’t know the difference, and I’m\nguessing that Boss Kromner doesn’t have an experienced Kekonese jade expert on hand. All that\nmediocre jade scrap sitting around in No Peak’s storage—that’s what I’m selling to the Bull and his\nCrew.”\nThey went inside the store. Hilo eyed a train set but it was too large to bring home in his\nluggage. He bought some bilingual board books and a water gun for Niko and a stuffed tiger for Ru.\nThe lady behind the cash register greeted Dauk by name and asked Hilo if he was visiting from out of\ntown. She was delighted to learn he was from Janloon; her parents were from there.\nAs they walked back to the house, Dauk said, “Even if what you’re selling to Kromner isn’t high\nquality, it’ll still make the Crews stronger and more dangerous. It’s not a solution.”\n“It’ll focus their attention elsewhere for quite a while,” Hilo said. “It’ll buy you time, Dauk-jen.\nTime to strengthen your own position—with more men and more jade.”\nDauk drew to a halt in the middle of the sidewalk. “What’re you proposing?”\nHilo stopped as well and turned around. “That No Peak equips you with jade—cut jade of good\nquality—as well as a few people to help train the Green Bones you have or will have. Your man,\nRohn Toro, is not young, and you’ve said yourself you’re short on others like him. Where does that\nleave you in five years? I can deal with that worry you have, by helping you build the advantage you\nneed over the Crews.”\nThe older man did not react at first. “You’re able to move that much cut jade?”\n“I have a clever Weather Man,” Hilo said. “I trust her to come up with a way.”"

Then he said slowly, “One does not simply give away jade,\nnot even to a friend.” He looked at Hilo with suspicion. “All things come at a cost, especially jade. So\nwhat cost will No Peak make us pay?”\nHilo put a hand on the man’s shoulder. “We only met this week, so I know that we’ve no history\non which to trust each other. But I’ve done my homework on you as well, Dauk-jen. You were born in\nJanloon and you come from a Green Bone family; your father was a war hero against the Shotarians.\nYou came here as a refugee and now the people in this neighborhood call you the Pillar. You’ve\nshown kindness and protection to my cousin, for which I’m grateful, and since I’ve been here you’ve\nbeen nothing but hospitable. You were able to arrange a meeting with the Bosses on short notice and\nto play the part I asked of you perfectly. So I like and trust you. And it’s made me think that we can\nhelp each other from now on.”\nDauk looked at him steadily. “You want a foreign tributary to the No Peak clan.”\nHilo considered this. “Not exactly, but something like that.” No Peak had a handful of tributary\nminor clans in Kekon, who fell under the umbrella of No Peak’s resources, protection, and jade\nallocation. In exchange, they either paid tribute out of their business earnings, just like Lantern Men,\nor partnered with the clan to run certain townships or industries. No Peak’s largest tributary, the Stone\nCup clan, did not hold any street territory of its own but managed a sizable share of the construction\ntrade, while its second largest, the Jo Sun clan, controlled most of the southern peninsula of Kekon.\n“My clan is expanding our business interests in this country,” Hilo said. “We’re buying real\nestate. We have plans to export more Kekonese goods to Espenia, and we want to help our Lantern\nMen in the clan to grow their companies by entering the Espenian market. My Weather Man wants to\nsend more Kekonese students, like my cousin Andy, to get an international education before they\nwork in the office on Ship Street. We need help to do all of that. We need connections in this country,\nand we need partners and allies.” Not just the pragmatic partners that Hilo knew the Weather Man’s\noffice was cultivating—foreign politicians, business people, educated graduates—but true allies who\nunderstood the weight of clan and jade, even if it was in their own strange and provincial way. Hilo\ngave Dauk Losun’s shoulder a firm pat. “Don’t take this the wrong way at all, but you don’t come\nacross like any sort of Pillar I’ve ever met in Kekon. But now I can see why you’re the right sort of\nman to be Pillar in a place like Espenia. You stay in the background, but you make things happen. I\nwould like for Green Bones to grow strong on both sides of the ocean. Will you and your people help\nin that, Dauk-jen?”"

Then he said, “I hope you’ll understand if I can’t agree to such a\nproposal right away. We’re a small but proud community here in Southtrap, and even though people\ncall me Pillar, it’s only out of respect. Others would have to agree, and no offense, Kaul-jen, but\nyou’re still a stranger to us. We don’t know what will happen after this agreement you’ve made with\nthe Crews, whether it will hold, or whether it’ll only bring more trouble.”\nHilo let go of Dauk’s shoulder and blew into his cupped hands to warm them from the chill.\nDauk did not seem bothered by the cold. “I’m not offended by your reluctance at all,” Hilo assured\nhim. “In fact, I would’ve had to reconsider my favorable impression of your judgment if you’d said\nyes right away without first talking to your wife and friends. I’ll say only one other thing, and then\nlet’s get back to the house where it’s warm. I don’t make promises lightly. You can ask anyone who\nknows me whether that’s true. Here’s the promise I’m making to you, Dauk-jen. If you’re willing to\ntrust me and to ally with the No Peak clan, in five years, we Kekonese will have more power in this\ncountry than any of the Crews.”\nThe Pillar of Southtrap clasped his hands together and touched them to his forehead, inclining in\na salute. “That’s something I’d like to bring about, Kaul-jen.”\nCHAPTER\n41\nGreen as Fuck\nA\nnden met with Hilo one last time before the Pillar left to return to Janloon. Hilo came to the Hians’\nyellow townhouse on a Sixthday morning, arriving alone in a taxi, wearing slacks that were casual\nenough for travel, dressed up with a fine new tan sport coat he’d bought from one of the expensive\nshops near the Crestwood Hotel on Bayliss Street. “Uncle and Auntie Hian,” he said when he came\nin, “I’m glad to have this chance to tell you in person how grateful I am that my cousin’s being well\ncared for.” He presented Anden’s hosts with a generous monetary gift and a beautiful rolled silkscreen\nprint from a famous Janloon artist. The elderly couple were intimidated to the point of near\nspeechlessness, murmuring their thanks and saluting repeatedly.\nHilo said, “Let’s go out for breakfast, Andy.”\nThey went to a Stepenish bakery and coffee house in Lochwood. “There was a place like this\nnext to the hotel where I stayed in Lybon when I went to fetch Niko,” Hilo explained. “I like these\nlittle pastries they make. Haven’t found them in Janloon, though. Someone should set up a shop.” The\nwaitress came by and Hilo nodded for Anden to pick whatever he wanted and to place their order.\n“All this is going to pay off, Andy,” Hilo said when the waitress departed. “Your studies, I mean.”\n“What do you think will happen now with the Crews?” Anden asked."

It’s risky because it means putting some of our jade in the\nhands of criminals. I’m only doing it because I think it’ll work out for us, but you never know. From\nnow on, I need you to keep your eyes and ears open, to tell us what you see going on, even if it\ndoesn’t seem important. Steer clear of any trouble, though. It’s good that you have friends here, but\nthey’re not family or clan, and No Peak can’t keep you safe when you’re so far away.”\nThe waitress returned with their order. Anden tried one of the pastries. It was sweet and flaky.\nHilo took a sip of coffee, made a face, and looked at Anden sternly. “I worry about you being here.\nAnywhere people hide their jade isn’t a good place. You know the saying, ‘Too dark to see green’?”\nAnden nodded; the idiom usually referred to locations or situations so evil and desperate that even\nGreen Bones did not feel safe entering. These days, it was also commonly used to describe books or\nmovies with especially grim themes in which there was no morality and the protagonists died in the\nend—the opposite of the traditional adventure stories with victorious Green Bone heroes. Anden felt a\nstab of resentment at the irony: Hilo had banished him from the clan in a rage, had refused to speak to\nhim for so long, but now that that had passed, the Pillar was full of brotherly concern.\n“You should phone home more often,” Hilo said. “Call collect; don’t worry about the money.”\n“Hilo-jen,” Anden said. He wasn’t sure how to broach the topic that was sitting so heavily on his\nmind and decided he had no choice but to bring it up directly. “I’ve been working hard and my grades\nare pretty good. I’ll graduate from the IESOL program next summer with an associate’s degree in\ncommunications and a language fluency certificate. Shouldn’t we talk about what happens\nafterward?”\nHilo was silent for a moment. Then he turned to the window next to them and tapped the glass.\n“You see that building over there?” Across the street, a new condominium complex was under\nconstruction. “We own it, through one of the clan’s Lantern Men. And it’s not the only thing we have.\nThere are a lot of changes going on, Andy. Shae is setting up a branch of the Weather Man’s office\nhere in Port Massy. It’ll manage our interests in this country and help Lantern Men who want to\nexpand into the Espenian market. She’s tapped Hami Tumashon to lead it, but they need more people\n—people who’re familiar with both cultures. Relationships with the local Kekonese-Espenian\ncommunity will be important to us; that’s one reason I came here, to make some of those connections\nin person.” Hilo said, “When you’ve gotten your degree, you’ll work in the new office.”\nA dull roaring was building in Anden’s head. “When you sent me to study here, you said that I\ncould come home after two years.”"

That’s what we’re doing now,” Hilo said.\n“We’re not talking about options. You’re telling me what I’m to do, and that’s to stay put.”\nAnden’s hands clenched under the table, twisting the cloth napkin in his lap. “How long do you\nexpect me to stay here? Another year? Five years? The rest of my life? You want me to be of use to\nNo Peak but stay in exile, so you don’t have to see or speak to me more than once every couple of\nyears?”\nHilo’s eyes flashed with a sudden, dangerous light, and even from across the small table, Anden\nfelt the hot surge of the Pillar’s jade aura. Anden could not help but flinch, but he did not lower his\ngaze nor apologize for what he’d said. He’d applied himself diligently during his time here, had done\neverything that his cousins had asked of him. Hilo had embraced him in the airport and called him\ncousin, had sat him on the Kaul side of the table in the Dauks’ dining room, had made an effort to\nspend time with him and shown him pictures of his nephews. All of these things had raised Anden’s\nexpectations, made him anticipate the clan’s forgiveness and a place back in Janloon. Now he did not\nknow what to think.\nA painfully long, grudging minute passed as the two men glared at each other, flaky pastries\nforgotten, coffee cooling. To Anden’s surprise, it was Hilo who sighed loudly and broke the silence\nfirst. “I should’ve made Shae explain this to you. It was her suggestion, not mine, but she leaves it to\nme to be the bad guy. Still, I don’t disagree with her. Learning Espenian is only worthwhile if you\napply it. You don’t want the last two years to be a waste. What could you do in Janloon that would be\nas useful to the clan as what you could accomplish here?”\n“There must be something,” Anden insisted.\nIn a cold voice, Hilo said, “Tell me you’ll put on jade, and I’ll book an airplane ticket for you to\nfly home tomorrow.”\nAnden swallowed but did not say anything. He should’ve known it was still about this.\nHilo closed his eyes briefly and rubbed a hand across his forehead. In that instant, he looked far\nolder than he had been just a few years ago, when he’d been the powerful young Horn of No Peak\nand it seemed that nothing could dent his cheerful ego. When he looked up again, he said, in a voice\nthat no longer held any anger, “You think I’m being stubborn, that I’m punishing you for longer than\nnecessary, still trying to force you to be a Green Bone.” When Anden still didn’t answer, Hilo nodded\na little glumly, and said, “I can see why you’d think that, but it’s not true, Andy, at least not anymore.\n“Janloon’s a Green Bone city. Sure, most of the people who live there don’t wear jade, but it’s\nstill a Green Bone city, and you’re not most people. There’s no way to change things that happened in"

You’ll be treated the way a recovered alcoholic or a\nreleased convict is treated—with pity. Is that what you want? If you intend to be something other than\nthat, you’ll have to figure it out for yourself. So you might as well do that here, where no one is\njudging you.”\n“Are you concerned about me, or just the family’s reputation?”\n“My wife’s a stone-eye,” Hilo said, “from a family that had a shit reputation before I made Kehn\nand Tar my closest Fists. You think that’s what matters to me?” He sounded angry again. “You’re\nfucking twenty-one years old, Andy, too young to be a case of ruined prospects in a green-as-fuck city\nlike Janloon.” The waitress came by and Hilo smiled at her and paid for their breakfasts. He turned\nback to Anden and said, “You’ve already settled in here, learned the language, started to make a life\nfor yourself. What about Dauk Coru? Don’t you want to stay with him?”\nAnden felt his face reddening; he couldn’t look his cousin in the eye. He almost blurted, “We’re\njust friends,” but managed to catch himself. The Pillar would see right away that it was a lie, and then\nAnden would only feel worse. Hilo didn’t believe in queerness being bad luck or a punishment of the\ngods—the same way he didn’t judge the Maiks for their family history or Wen for being a stone-eye.\nBut Anden had never spoken to his cousin about romantic things—indeed, he’d never spoken to\nanyone—and his first instinct was to deny. He did want to stay with Cory; he wanted to see him far\nmore often than he did now. And despite himself, he’d begun to like Port Massy, to see its muddled\nnature and strange customs as unique and vibrant in their own way. But he also wanted to go home, to\nhear his native language spoken on the streets, to be surrounded by the sights and smells of Janloon\nthat he’d grown up with but always taken for granted. The conflict felt irreconcilable.\nAnden forced himself to look up. “Cory knows I only planned to study here for two years. And\nhe’s going to be in law school for a while. We haven’t talked about the future.” Hilo was looking at\nhim steadily and he felt supremely uncomfortable, but he kept talking, deciding he didn’t care\nanymore. “I don’t know if he’d want to live in Janloon, but if we were really serious, maybe he’d\nconsider it. He’s Kekonese after all.”\nHilo shrugged. “In a way, I suppose.”\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n“Andy, your face might blend in here, but you’re more Kekonese than Dauk’s son will ever be.\nHe wears jade, but you can tell that he’s never had to kill for it, or fear being killed for it.

Anden could\nnot think of anything else to say.\nThey left the coffee shop and Hilo hailed a taxi to take him back to the Crestwood Hotel where\nhe would meet up with Maik Tar and gather his bags before leaving for the airport. Anden didn’t\nknow how to say goodbye; he didn’t even know when he would see Hilo again. He wasn’t sure\nwhether to embrace his cousin, or salute him, or turn and walk away without looking at him. As the\ntaxi pulled up to the curb in front of them, Anden murmured, “Have a safe trip, Hilo-jen. Say hello to\neveryone back home for me.”\nHilo placed a hand on the back of Anden’s neck and drew him close for a moment. “Take care of\nyourself, cousin,” he said. Then he was getting in the taxi and closing the door, and the cab was\ndriving away, lost in Port Massy traffic.\nAnden stood on the street corner for a long minute, then he went back into the coffee shop where\nhe found a pay phone just inside the door. He picked up the slightly sticky receiver and dropped a\ncoin into the slot. After three rings, Cory’s sleepy voice said, “Hello?”\n“It’s me,” Anden said. “Are you doing anything today?”\n“No. Just packing.” Cory was returning to AC tomorrow morning. Something in Anden’s voice\nmust’ve sounded strange, because Cory said, “What’s going on, crumb?”\nAnden rested his forehead against the top of the metal phone casing. “I’m at a coffee shop in\nLochwood, on the corner of Thurlow and Fifty-Seventh Street. If you’re not busy right now… do you\nthink you could come pick me up?”\n“Um, sure, okay. Just let me get dressed.” A rustle of movement. “You want to do something?”\nAnden said, fiercely, “I want to fuck.”\nA moment of silence passed. Cory said, “I’ll come get you.”\nCHAPTER\n42\nA Difficult Position\nS\nhae was astounded by how much difficulty her brother had managed to create for her in such a\nshort amount of time. It was dangerous to let Hilo off the island of Kekon, she concluded. It seemed\neach time he returned from an overseas trip, it was with news of some shocking and irrevocable thing\nhe had accomplished abroad. This time, at least, he had not recklessly killed anyone, although she\nexpected inevitable violent consequences were still forthcoming.\n“It was a good trip,” Hilo told her. “I had some useful conversations.”\n“You sold a hundred kilos of raw jade rock to an Espenian crime boss, and you promised cut"

        "text": "“It was a good trip,” Hilo told her. “I had some useful conversations.”\n“You sold a hundred kilos of raw jade rock to an Espenian crime boss, and you promised cut\njade, manpower, and from the sounds of it, tributary clan status to some people you just met.”\n“Do you disagree with what I did?” Hilo asked mildly, but with a narrow-eyed expression at her\ntone. “I solved the problem they were having with the Crews and got exactly what you wanted:\ninformation and allies in Port Massy. A way for us to gain a stronger foothold in Espenia and grow the\nclan’s business over there without relying solely on those swindling foreign politicians.”\n“By selling raw jade to a well-known criminal kingpin,” she repeated.\nHilo crouched down to fix one of Niko’s shoes that had come loose. “The KJA controls all\nofficial mining, and thanks to the Royal Council, there’s now a shitload of regulations to keep all that\nactivity on public record. But both the Mountain and No Peak have been confiscating jade from\nsmuggling operations—and that jade isn’t officially declared anywhere. All of it goes through the\nHorn’s side of the clan—it’s considered victor’s spoils, same as from any battle or duel. I’ve got a bag\nof it sitting in my drawer in the study. None of that shows up in any KJA files. Nau Suen has been\nraiding Zapunyo’s jobs the same way we have; what do you imagine Ayt Mada’s doing with their\nshare of the jade? And do you think she’s given up on producing shine after you leaked her Ygutanian\nfactories to the Espenians?” Hilo shook his head. He lifted Niko onto the swing set that had been\ninstalled on the lawn in the garden and pushed him back and forth. “I’d bet my own green the\nMountain’s still enriching its purse, in ways we don’t know about and can’t prove. It was always part\nof Ayt’s strategy that Kekon supply both sides of the conflict.”\nShae sat down on the stone bench by the pond and studied the water pensively. What Hilo said\nwas true; one of Wen’s White Rats had provided phone logs that showed Iwe Kalundo and his top\nLuckbringers making long-distance calls to Ygutan. Another informer reported that the Mountain’s\nWeather Man had recently made a business trip to that country. Ayt Mada was no doubt well aware of\nNo Peak’s alliance with the Espenians and seeking to expand her clan’s own businesses—legitimate\nand otherwise. Due to the Mountain’s previous activities in Ygutan and connections such as the late\nTem Ben, it made sense that Ayt was choosing to focus on the other world power with a market large\nenough to rival Espenia. It would not surprise Shae in the least if the Mountain was rebuilding its\nSN1 factories right now—perhaps somewhere less vulnerable to detection and attack, such as the\ndemilitarized Tun-Ygutan border—or pursuing some even larger scheme.\nDespite agreeing with Hilo’s assessment, Shae was disturbed by the path he had set them on.\n“Ayt Mada’s undermining the KJA, putting jade in the hands of foreigners and criminals who don’t\ndeserve it and can’t control it,” she said. “By selling jade to Kromner, we’re following her example."

        "text": "deserve it and can’t control it,” she said. “By selling jade to Kromner, we’re following her example.\nWe’re acting no differently than our enemies.”\nHilo made a noise in the back of his throat. “If it were up to me, foreigners wouldn’t have jade at\nall, but we’re way past that point, Shae. Grandda’s generation went down that road thirty years ago,\nas soon as they let the Espenians into the country and took their money to rebuild after the war. Now\nlook at where we are: SN1 and IBJCS and all the other shit.” He leveled a faintly accusing look at his\nsister that suggested she was as much to blame as anyone for this, having made decisions that further\nentangled them with foreign interests.\nHilo went on. “Ayt will sell jade under the table to make the Mountain powerful enough to\neventually destroy us and rule the country themselves. If we’re not willing to make some big moves\nof our own, that’s exactly what’ll happen.” He stared into the distance as he continued to push his son\non the swing with one hand. “Unlike Ayt, though, I’ve no intention of keeping my clients. The Crews\naren’t a state, and their people aren’t warriors. They’re like the greedy sailors that landed on Kekon\nhundreds of years ago. They’ve no clan loyalty, no real brotherhood. They want jade but don’t know\nwhat it means or how to handle it. We’ll take the money they’re offering and invest it where we need\nit, shore ourselves up, because the Mountain is going to come after us again; it’s just a matter of\ntime.”\n“How am I supposed to move that much jade across the Amaric Ocean?”\nHilo gave her a crooked smile. “Kehn and his people have experience with all of Zapunyo’s\nmethods, we’ve confiscated ships and containers, we have companies and people on both sides of the\nocean. I’m sure my Weather Man will figure something out.”\nShae grimaced. She was already deeply uncomfortable wielding the clan’s influence over the\nRoyal Council in support of the Espenians’ political agenda. The agreement Hilo had made might turn\ninto yet another area where she’d have to regularly plead the understanding and forgiveness of the\ngods. “The black market jade trade—we’re getting into a dangerous game, Hilo.”\n“You have to go where your enemies are,” Hilo said. “And then further.”\nShae gave her brother a long look. She was accustomed to being the one who made decisions\nabout the clan’s foreign interests; the idea of Hilo acting like a cold-blooded Horn in the place where\nthe Weather Man’s office was placing its stakes made her nervous. She wished she could speak to\nLan. She wanted to consult his thoughtful, steady moral compass, his broader view of aisho, his\nprudent mind. She imagined that if she’d been Lan’s Weather Man, they would’ve had detailed,\nrational discussions before each major clan decision. Hilo was guided by his own strict principles,\nthat was certainly true, but on his own, he took instinctive action with all the decisive military\ncunning he considered necessary—and filled in the rationale later. “I heard one of the Kobens was\ngunned down in a parking lot last week,” she said."

Not only had the assassin—a\nman with no clan ties and a long record of petty crime and mental illness—been conveniently killed\nby police while fleeing arrest, but Koben Ento himself had proven unexpectedly and unintentionally\nhelpful, loudly blaming a business rival in the Iwe family before dying of his injuries in the hospital\nsome hours later. Of course there was suspicion that Ayt herself had whispered the man’s name, or\nthat No Peak was behind it—but conflicting speculation was to be expected. The important thing was\nthat the Mountain’s various factions were at each other’s throats, each convinced that the others were\nout to ruin them, and demanding Ayt Madashi quell the infighting by making a decision about the\nsuccession.\nA group of workers passed, pushing a trolley stacked with folding chairs. Large red tents were\nbeing erected in the courtyard for tomorrow’s festivities. Woon Papidonwa and his bride would be\ngetting married at the Temple of Divine Return, but Hilo had generously offered to host the reception\nat the Kaul estate, as a gift to the new couple and in recognition of Woon’s status in the clan. Since\nShae had convinced the Weather Man’s Shadow to stay on in his role, more than a year had come and\ngone, but Woon had not made any further mention of resigning his post, perhaps because he seemed\nto be much happier now. Shae was glad for him, but the feeling was not unreserved.\nNiko held his arms out to be taken off the swing, and Hilo obliged, setting him down and\nwatching the boy scamper off down the garden path. “I haven’t seen Maro around lately,” Hilo said.\n“Are things over between the two of you?”\nShae did her best to sound nonchalant. “We’re on something of a break right now.” She\nsuspected that statement sounded as noncommittal and confused as the issue itself, and was\ndisappointed that she was not as beyond caring about her brother’s judgment as she’d thought she\nwas. “We’re still friends,” she added. “He’s coming as my guest to the wedding tomorrow.”\nHilo gave her a knowing, almost sad look, as if he guessed how much the duel had cost her,\nmore than even her jade. “If you’re friends like you say, you should be honest with him, Shae.”\nShae pretended not to have heard him. “Maro’s been involved in a humanitarian advocacy group\ncalled Four Virtues International. He asked if you’d be willing to meet with some of the\nrepresentatives who’re looking for the clan’s support. It would mean a lot to them.”\nHilo sighed in exasperation—possibly with her for redirecting the conversation, possibly at the\nfact that as Pillar he was being constantly petitioned by various groups and had never ceased to find it\ntedious. “All right, as a favor to your… friend,” he said. “Sometime in the new year, when things\naren’t as busy.” Wen was due to give birth in a month. Niko came back with a fistful of colorful\npebbles; Hilo made a show of admiring them, then picked the boy up to bring him indoors for lunch."

She called after him. “Would you\nreally have done it? If Ayt had killed me in the duel, would you have broken aisho and gone back to\nwar with a dirty blade?”\n“Ayt thought I would.” Hilo’s aura was smooth as a river. “That’s what’s important.”\nChancellor Son was warming up at the target range of the Three Springs Leisure Club when Shae\njoined him that afternoon. “Kaul-jen,” he exclaimed, with a relaxed and cheerful air. “A lovely day,\nisn’t it?” The chancellor was three months away from the end of what had been a grueling six-year\nterm in office and he was obviously looking forward to having more time for his family business, his\ngrandchildren, and the game of chasso.\nChasso is a cross-country game that involves walking through a sprawling and manicured\nparkland, stopping at regular intervals to shoot fake birds (tufted rubber balls launched from hidden\nmachines) with crossbow darts fired from specialized bows. Although chasso began as a foreign\ngentleman’s game with origins in hunting and archery, in the past decade it caught on as a popular\npastime for wealthy Kekonese. Janloon’s most well-heeled politicians and businessmen regularly\nconducted business over games at the recently built Three Springs Leisure Club, located thirty\nminutes south of Janloon.\nShae personally found the game uninteresting in the extreme, but she understood why it\nappealed to someone like Son Tomarho. Devoting so much land to private recreation on an island\nwhere space was at a premium meant exorbitant, status-enhancing membership fees; the sport\nrequired reflexes, good aim, and expensive equipment but low physical fitness; and aging Kekonese\nmen still liked to pretend they were capable warriors. She also suspected that Son enjoyed beating her\nat the game, as jade abilities were of minimal advantage.\nShae waited until after they’d spent the first two flushes in social chat and were hiking up a low\nhill against the wind to the third flush point before she decided to broach the topic she’d come to\ndiscuss. “No one deserves a break from the pressures of Wisdom Hall more than you, Chancellor Son,\nbut it’ll be a loss for the No Peak clan to no longer have such a dependable friend in the chancellor’s\noffice next year.” The Royal Council had voted in Guim En, the current Minister of Home Concerns,\nas Son’s successor. Guim was viewed as an experienced, fiscally responsible statesman with a\npopulist streak. He was also a long-standing member of the Mountain clan.\n“Guim is a reasonable man,” Son said unconcernedly, planting himself at the vantage marker and\nlifting the chasso bow to his ample shoulder. Son raised his left arm to signal his readiness to the\nmachine operator below. One after another, half a dozen chasso balls flew into the air from behind a\nrow of shrubs. Son fired in rapid sequence and grunted in satisfaction as three impaled balls thudded\nto the lawn below."

Son fired in rapid sequence and grunted in satisfaction as three impaled balls thudded\nto the lawn below.\n“This is a difficult time for the country and for No Peak,” Shae said. “The clans have held to\npeace, but only because the world around us hasn’t. Can we count on Guim En to continue to pressure\nthe Uwiwa Islands over smuggling? Will he keep holding the Mountain accountable to the KJA? Will\nhe oppose the Oortokon Conflict Refugee Act when it’s time for the Royal Council to vote?”\nSon stepped aside and Shae took his place at the vantage marker. The chasso balls flew; Shae\npinned two of them using the rented bow from the leisure club shop. She grimaced, tempted to cheat\nby Deflecting her opponent’s darts at the next flush. As they hiked down to collect their points, Son\nsaid, in a considerably more somber voice, “Kaul-jen, I was there in the room during the visit from\nthe Espenian secretary, and I’m well aware of the foreigners’ security concerns. But the Refugee Act\naddresses a humanitarian issue. No Peak will seem heartless to oppose it.” He wiped his brow and\nbent his large frame to pick up his downed chasso balls, which he handed to the young chasskeeper\nwho tailed them at a respectful distance, carrying equipment and water and keeping score.\n“Compassion is one of the four Divine Virtues, after all.”\nShae didn’t disagree with Son’s sentiments. Nevertheless, she said to Son, “In a perfect world,\npeople would act in accordance with the Divine Virtues all the time, and then I suppose the Return\nwould be in sight. But the world is far from perfect, and we both know there are trade-offs to be\nmade.”\nSon turned around and jabbed one of the chasso darts into the air. “The Espenians are asking us\nto turn away homeless widows and orphans because they’re afraid some of them might be Ygutanian\nspies. Should we compromise our morals on account of foreign pressure?” Son’s words were\nindignant but his tone was resigned, and his objections were more rhetorical bluster than true\ndisagreement. He knew as well as Shae did that No Peak was in a difficult position. The military\nchallenges in Oortoko had made the Espenians paranoid and controlling. To their continued\ndispleasure, the Kekonese Royal Council held firm in refusing to contribute soldiers or additional jade\nto the Oortokon War effort. Yet all the while, Shae had steered the clan toward business expansion\nand trade deals with Espenia and was opening a branch of the Weather Man’s office in Port Massy.\nNow that Hilo had established clan ties with the Green Bones in Espenia, and knowing that the\nMountain was seeking its own foreign opportunities, Shae was all the more certain that No Peak\nneeded every bit of political influence it could hang on to, at home and abroad. It needed the\ncontinued favor of Adamont Capita. As did the whole country, for a fact, if it wished to maintain its\nrapid economic growth. The Son family’s own textile business was benefiting handsomely from\nreduced tariffs.\n“You’ve held Kekon’s highest political office during clan war within our country, and now\nforeign war surrounding it,” Shae pointed out to the chancellor. “You know all about pressure—and"

The afternoon was cooling fast; it\nwouldn’t be long before the autumn chill and the dimming light drove them back indoors.\n“You’re not an old man yet, Chancellor Son. Look at how you’re outlasting me on the chasso\ncourse.” Shae paused in the middle of the path and faced the man. “On behalf of the Pillar, I must ask\nyou for one more act of friendship to No Peak. Don’t retire after the end of your term. Keep your seat\nin the Royal Council. You’ll have plenty of time to enjoy yourself later, but stay in government for\nanother year or two, and continue to do the good work this country needs of you.” She paused\nmeaningfully. “The clan would be grateful to you, and your family.”\nAs a former Lantern Man, Chancellor Son knew that the clan’s gratitude was not something\nlightly given and almost certainly meant a significant monetary reward to him and his relatives. If he\nremained in the Royal Council, Son would continue to act as No Peak’s most senior politician in\nWisdom Hall and would vote in line with the clan’s interests. In the event of a tie, his status as\nchancellor emeritus gave him the same privilege as the sitting chancellor—to cast an additional, tie-\nbreaking vote—which would potentially negate Guim’s deciding power.\nChancellor Son pursed his thick lips. Speaking thoughtfully, but not without a touch of pride, “I\nsuppose, after a lifetime of public service, what is one more year?” He fixed Shae with a sober,\ncalculating gaze before hefting his chasso bow and turning back to the path. “I remain a loyal friend\nof the clan, Kaul-jen, but I can’t hold back a tide. Most people don’t understand the trade agreements\nor care about the Espenians’ security concerns. Many don’t see why we should accommodate\nforeigners at all. You’re walking a thin line. If you keep pitting the interests of No Peak against the\nwill of the country, you won’t prevail.”\nShae was not normally a heavy drinker, but she had several glasses of wine at Woon’s wedding\nreception the following evening. Sometime after midnight, the bride and groom departed to the cheers\nof the guests, in a limousine festooned with red and yellow peonies symbolizing marital happiness\nand fertility. Shortly afterward, Shae left the party and retired to the Weather Man’s residence. Maro,\ndressed in a pressed blue linen suit and tie, walked with her to the front door. She paused before she\nwent inside and turned to him over her shoulder. “Do you want to come in for a little while?”\nShe wasn’t sure if it was politeness, or drunken wistfulness, or something else that made her ask,\nbut in that moment, she hoped he would say yes. Dozens of people had seen them leave the reception\ntogether, but having already endured and survived national public scandal, Shae no longer cared if\nthere was clan gossip tomorrow morning."

Maro poured two\ntall glasses of chilled mint water from the pitcher in her fridge. Shae accepted one of them gratefully\nand pressed the cold glass to her forehead before draining half of it. Although the Weather Man’s\nhouse was at the far end of the central courtyard, she could still hear the music and Perceive the\nenergy of the remaining crowd like a distant background throbbing. By now, her body had acclimated\nto carrying less jade, but at times she felt as if her senses were softened, muted around the edges. The\nalcohol she’d consumed exacerbated the effect; she was tired and everything seemed slightly gauzy.\nMaro sat down at the other end of the sofa and leaned back, loosening his tie and taking a drink\nfrom his own glass of water. He didn’t appear as inebriated as she felt. “Your friend Woon Papi must\nbe very dedicated to the clan,” he said. “Your family threw quite the party for him.”\n“He was my eldest brother’s best friend.” And mine. “He deserves it.”\n“Well, thank you for inviting me.” Maro turned the glass in his hands. “And I appreciate you\nsetting up a meeting for Four Virtues to talk to your brother.” As if trying to fill the air between them,\nhe continued, “I’ve been on their steering committee for a while. They’re doing good work but can\nonly get so far without more high-profile support. It would be an enormous step for the major clans to\npublicly acknowledge the need for Kekon to take a more active role in international humanitarian\nefforts.” He looked to her as if hoping for agreement. “Perhaps we can convince your brother to lend\nhis support to the Oortokon Conflict Refugee Act.”\nShae was in no mood to explain the situation involving the clan’s business interests and the\npressure from the Espenian government, nor suggest that she was the one holding Chancellor Son and\nthe Royal Council accountable to questionable foreign interests. “Let’s not talk politics right now,”\nshe said.\nMaro tugged at his collar. “If you say so,” he said uncertainly, as if Shae had snatched away the\nlast of their safe conversation topics. A swollen silence hung between them. Nearly five months had\npassed since the duel, but their relationship persisted in the awkward limbo of two objects held at a\nprecise distance by constant centrifugal force, unable to move either closer together or farther apart.\nThey’d spoken on the phone. They’d had lunch together a number of times. Shae still consulted Maro\non questions of economics and foreign policy, and now he was hoping for the clan’s endorsement of\nthe nonprofit work that had begun to consume a greater amount of his time. They were cordial,\nfriendly—but they circled each other tentatively, as if the other person was a fire whose warmth they\ncraved but knew might burn.\nMaro had, on more than one occasion, implied that they could get over this difficult stretch if\nthey were both willing to trust again.

Tonight she\nached for closeness—but she did not deserve Maro’s trust and could not bear to regain it dishonestly.\nShe considered thanking him for coming and politely showing him to the door. She considered\npulling him over to her and fucking him on the floor of the living room. Neither option seemed\nentirely correct, nor fair to her friend. She did not regret the decisions she’d made, but she did regret\nthat she could no longer look at Maro without seeing the impassable distance between the realities\nthey inhabited.\n“Shae.” Maro cleared his throat roughly, then got up and moved to sit next to her. His soft aura\nbrushed against her, brimming with conflicted desire, almost distress. He had trimmed his beard and\nthere was tension in the curve of his jaw. “I think I understand better why you shut me out before.\nI’ve accepted the fact that you were under a lot of pressure at the time and wanted to keep me from\nbeing targeted. But I’m not sure I can do this anymore—be your friend, that is. Someone who’s\nvaguely associated with your family, who gets invited to weddings, but isn’t a part of the clan itself.\nIt’s… not a good position to be in.”\nA heaviness came to rest below Shae’s rib cage. “I know. I tried it once myself and it didn’t work\nout.” She sank lower onto the sofa. A throbbing had begun somewhere behind her eye sockets.\n“You’re right. I’ve kept you at a distance and not told you the truth you deserve. I was trying to\nprotect you from my decisions, but it was wrong of me.”\nMaro’s face moved in a brief spasm. “You can’t shelter me. You know that I don’t like Green\nBone culture, but I still care about you. Do you remember when I said I wanted us to be completely\nopen and honest with each other?” He searched her face. “I need to know where I stand with you. Can\nyou just tell me once and for all: Is there any chance for us?”\nHilo’s words came back to her: If you’re his friend as you say, you should be honest with him.\nThe pressure of a fierce and masochistic abandon swelled inside Shae’s chest. She wrapped a hand\naround Maro’s neck and kissed him. The taste and smell of him flooded into her mouth, and she\nsighed, filled with bittersweet ferocity as strong as the dry lingering taste of wine. When she pulled\nback, Shae said, “I had an abortion, Maro. I was pregnant before I fought the duel with Ayt Mada.”\nMaro’s face went blank for several seconds, then he sat back as if he’d been shoved hard. A\ncloud passed over his gentle features, turning them wounded and ugly. The edges of his jade aura\nseemed to ripple and harden. “You…” His voice came out as a coarse whisper. “You kept this from\nme. You decided without even telling me. Just like the duel.”"

Shae felt the painful weight of his\nstare pressing down on her for a long, silent moment. She leaned her head back against the cushions.\nThe ceiling seemed to be rotating and so she closed her eyes and did not watch as Maro turned away\nand left the house.\nCHAPTER\n43\nFamily Jade\nT\nhree weeks before New Year’s, Hilo drove an hour inland from Janloon and stopped at an\nabandoned farmhouse indicated only by a highway marker on a flat stretch of road at the foothills of\nthe mountains. He navigated the Duchesse’s bulk up the rutted dirt path until it became too narrow\nand overgrown, then he got out of the car and walked the rest of the way to the single crumbling brick\nbuilding. The sun had already slid behind the forested rolling peaks that dominated the sky to the\nwest, and bats were flitting all over the empty field, flickers of heat in the periphery of Hilo’s\nPerception. Two of Tar’s men stood in a clearing behind the farmhouse, digging a hole, their shovels\nscraping and clanging against dry dirt, breaths steaming in the air. They paused in their work, wiping\ntheir brows with their forearms and touching their heads in abbreviated salute as the Pillar passed and\nducked under the sagging eave to enter the dilapidated structure.\nInside, stark light came from an electric camping lantern hanging from a metal hook fashioned\nfrom a coat hanger. A layer of dirt, straw, and bird droppings caked the stone floor. Tar and his\nlieutenant Doun stood together, chatting and sharing a smoke as they waited for Hilo’s arrival. Near\ntheir feet was a long lump, wrapped in canvas and tied with rope, like a badly rolled carpet. Next to\nthe lump was a large rectangular steel container with a lid, lying open—an underbody truck toolbox\nthat Tar had purchased from a freight equipment company.\nAt Hilo’s entrance, Doun saluted, then bent down and cut the ropes binding the lump. He pulled\naway the canvas to reveal a dirty and bruised young man. The teenager had been gagged and bound,\nbut at the sudden light, he blinked and twisted on the ground, struggling to sit up. His shrill jade aura\nflared, as painful in Hilo’s mind as a blast of microphone feedback. Doun stood back and Hilo looked\ndown into a thin, sweaty face and eyes wide with hate and fear. The Pillar’s gaze slid off the captive’s\nface and settled on the jade beads around his neck and then the jade-studded forearm cuffs cinched to\nhis skinny arms. Kaul Lan’s jade.

        "text": "his skinny arms. Kaul Lan’s jade. It had not even been reset.\nHilo was overcome by a sense of cold rage and deep unease. Years ago, when he was the Horn\nunder his brother, he’d been at the Twice Lucky restaurant in the Docks on a night when two teenage\nhoodlums tried to steal the jade off a drunken old Green Bone. Hilo and the Maiks had been there to\nstop them, but Hilo remembered thinking that those boys were a sign of a growing societal rot, an\nomen of worse to come. He felt that way even more strongly now, looking at this stranger, this\nnobody who had caused so much grief to the Kaul family and yet managed to go unpunished for so\nlong. Some people believed that with SN1, jade could be worn by anyone—but that could never be\ntrue. Because if any lowlife could wear Lan’s jade, then jade meant nothing. The world of Green\nBones meant nothing. The sheer nihilistic possibility horrified Hilo to his core. The No Peak clan was\nlike a tiger, and this thief like a rat, but even the largest, most powerful creature would fear a plague\nof rats, moving in the dark with sharp teeth and carrying disease. It was an imbalance in nature, a sign\nof an accelerating fundamental wrongness in the world that even this moment couldn’t set right.\nTar had opened a duffel bag and was laying out some tools: a cordless drill, a length of plastic\ntubing, duct tape. Hilo crouched down. The teenager jerked away from him, straining with Strength to\nbreak his bonds. He threw a Deflection that rippled out in an unfocused wave, sending the dirt on the\nground puffing against the stone walls and swaying the hanging camp lantern as Hilo dispelled the\npanicked effort with a casual counter Deflection. Doun came over and pinned the prisoner’s shoulders\nto the ground to stop his flailing. Hilo undid the buckles on the cuffs and removed them one by one.\nHe reached around the boy’s straining neck and unfastened the clasp, gathering the long string of jade\nbeads into his hand. Hilo tucked Lan’s jade into his inside jacket pocket. He patted a hand over the\nbulge, reassuring himself that it was secure.\nThe thief moaned; his eyes rolled and his body shook and shuddered with the initial jolt of jade\nwithdrawal. Hilo removed the gag from his mouth. The teen spat blood-tinged grit through broken\nteeth, and to Hilo’s surprise, he swiveled his head to stare at Tar, his face contorted and gaze burning\nwith a loathing that seemed larger than his skinny frame could hold.\n“You,” the thief snarled, his voice shaking. “You killed my da. You slit his throat and threw him\nin the harbor. I hope you and your whole family die screaming, you soulless piece of shit.”\nTar glanced over with interest, then went back to fitting a drill bit. “Who was he?”\n“His name was Mudt Jindonon.” The boy began to weep; ugly tracks ran down his muddy face.\n“He owned a store and a bit of jade, that’s all. He was my da, and you killed him.”\n“I remember Mudt Jin.” Tar nodded that it all made sense now. “Mountain spy, shine dealer, jade"

He was my da, and you killed him.”\n“I remember Mudt Jin.” Tar nodded that it all made sense now. “Mountain spy, shine dealer, jade\nthief, crime ring leader. Helped to plan the cowardly murder of a Green Bone Pillar. Normally I don’t\nlike to think that bad blood runs in the family, but I guess in this case it’s true.”\nHilo looked at the noisily crying teenager who’d killed his brother and escaped, then desecrated\nthe family’s grave for its jade. He felt no sense of triumph, just an overwhelming disgust and pity, a\nheavy and impatient desire to finish something that should’ve been done long ago. Hilo unbuttoned\nhis shirt down to the navel and pulled it open. He removed three jade studs from his chest, wincing a\nlittle as he worked them free. He rolled them in the palm of his hand, his own jade, won in his youth\nagainst some enemy he could not now remember. He would barely feel the loss of them now, but back\nthen, every bit of green he’d added to his body had tasted like destiny. “Look at me,” the Pillar said\nsoftly. He held out the three jade studs in his hand. “This is Kaul family jade. It’s what you were\nwilling to kill and steal for. I’m giving it to you. You’ll take it with you to the grave, just like a Green\nBone.”\n“It wasn’t me!” Mudt screamed, animal fear finally blotting out his deep rage. “There was\nanother guy! He did it—the whole thing, it was all his idea. I just went along—”\nHilo gripped the thief’s jaw and squeezed, forcing his mouth open and cutting off his frantic\nprotests. One by one, he dropped the three jade studs into Mudt’s mouth, then clamped the jaw shut.\nTar tore a piece of duct tape from a long silver roll and sealed the teen’s lips. They wound more tape\naround the wrists and ankles to make the bonds extra secure, then Tar took the thief’s feet, and Doun\ngripped him under the armpits, and they hefted him easily, placing him inside the metal box. With\nknees bent, he fit with barely any room to spare and could not turn over inside. Hilo caught one last\nhaunting glimpse of the white face, stark with terror, before they dropped the lid in place. Thuds, faint\nscreaming, and spiking jade aura shrieks emanated from inside the container, interrupting the whine\nof the cordless drill as Tar made holes all around the edge of the lid and fastened it in place with metal\nscrews. Using the largest drill bit, he made a hole near the top of the box big enough to stick a finger\nthrough. Into this he inserted a length of plastic tubing through which air could flow. They didn’t want\nthe trapped man to suffocate.\nTar and Doun carried the box outside. The two men in the field had finished digging and were\nleaning on their shovels, resting. When they saw the Pillar coming out of the building, they set down\ntheir tools and hurried to help Tar and Doun balance the box and lower it into the hole in the earth.\nFilling in the two-meter-deep grave took an hour, with all five men taking turns with the shovels"

At last, there was only a patch of fresh soil to mark where the box was buried,\nand poking up from the ground, a barely visible stiff plastic air tube.\nWithout his regular dose of shine, an addict would normally begin to feel the effects of jade\noverexposure within twenty-four hours. With jade trapped inside an adrenaline-overloaded body, it\nwas sure to happen much faster than that. The Itches would set in shortly thereafter.\nThey collected the camping lantern and tools from the empty farmhouse. It was entirely silent\nout here in the country. The night sky was clear and filled with stars. None of the pollution or noise\nfrom Janloon reached them, and there were no other dwellings in sight. The nearest town, Opia, was\nthirty kilometers away on winding, mountainous roads. As they walked back to the cars, Hilo made a\npoint of personally thanking the three Nails (that was what Tar called his people now, to differentiate\nthem from Kehn’s Fingers) for spending what would’ve been a nice evening diligently carrying out\nsuch an unpleasant task. All of them—Doun, Tyin, and Yonu—assured the Pillar that it was simply\ntheir duty to the memory of Kaul Lan, and they were only sorry that it had taken them so long to find\nthe thief and dispense the clan’s justice.\nHilo said to Tar, “You made sure the bartender who phoned in the tip was rewarded?”\n“Of course,” Tar said.\nBetween handling this and whispering the name of Koben Ento, Tar had been working hard\nlately. With the clan’s expansion into Espenia, Hilo had some ideas for how to use Tar’s small team in\nthe future, but now was not the time to broach them. He put a hand on his Pillarman’s back. “I know\nthat sometimes I’m impatient or short-tempered with you, but only because you’re my closest brother\nnow, and I trust you with things I wouldn’t trust to anyone else,” Hilo said. “I’m glad I can count on\nyou, Tar. I don’t say it often enough.”\nIt was the early hours of the morning by the time Hilo arrived back home. He closed the front door\nquietly behind him as he entered without turning on any of the lights, so as not to disturb Wen and the\nbaby, only two weeks old, a girl of course. In the kitchen, he draped his jacket over the back of a chair\nand washed his hands in the sink. He was tired, but also hungry and thirsty, so he poured himself a\nglass of water and took two oranges from the fruit bowl and a bag of peanuts to the table. The Pillar\nsat in the dark, peeling and eating the oranges and cracking the peanut shells. He was rarely alone, so\nhe relished the moment of peace and did not hurry to go to bed.\nHilo took Lan’s jade from his pocket, set it on the table, and looked at it.\nA stir in his Perception told him that someone else was awake in the house.

He sensed Niko’s\napproach before he heard the boy’s feet padding hesitantly down the stairs and stopping at the\nentrance to the kitchen. The blinds were open over the patio door and the moon’s glow mingled with\nthe courtyard lights so it was just bright enough for Hilo to see his nephew’s face, creased with\nsleepiness and mild concern. “Uncle?” he said. “Why are you sitting in the dark?”\n“I got home late and didn’t want to wake you.” Hilo held out his arms and the boy came to him,\nclimbing into his lap and laying his head against his uncle’s chest. Even though Niko and Ru knew\neach other as brothers and called Wen their mother, Hilo always insisted that Niko call him uncle so\nthat he’d never forget who his real father was. Hilo smoothed the boy’s hair and whispered, “Stand\nup, I want to show you something.” He set the three-year-old (almost four now, Hilo reminded\nhimself) down on his feet and said, “Do you want to know where I was tonight, why I got home so\nlate I couldn’t tuck you into bed? I was searching for something, something that’s been lost for a\nwhile, and I finally found it.” He picked up the cuffs and the necklace of jade and let the boy admire\nand touch them. Some limited jade exposure at this young age was not harmful; indeed, it was\nbeneficial for a child to have a basic foundation of jade tolerance before Academy age. “This was\nyour father’s jade, Niko,” Hilo said. “It belonged to him when he was Pillar of the clan. One day,\nwhen you’re a Green Bone, it’ll belong to you. I’ll keep it safe for you until then.”\nNiko yawned. “I’ll have to grow a lot bigger first.”\n“A lot bigger,” Hilo agreed. He picked the child up and carried him back up the stairs.\nCHAPTER\n44\nThe Man in the Middle\nW\nillum “Skinny” Reams stood on a private boat dock under the shadow of the Iron Eye Bridge. It\nwas a cloudy, starless spring night and the dark was almost absolute, save for the lights that\nilluminated the six-lane freeway that ran overhead, carrying a constant stream of traffic across the\nCamres River, the rush of the tires above louder than the steady lapping of the water below.\nFour of Reams’s coats waited for the shipment along with him. The twins, Coop and Bairn\nBreuer, stood next to the car that had been pulled up to the pier. Pats Rudy and Carson Sunter kept\nwatch, hands resting on the butts of their pistols. It was not the first time Reams and his men had\ntaken possession of a contraband shipment ferried up the river. The Camres was one of the longest\nand busiest commercial waterways in the world; for centuries it had been called the Silver Run, but it\nwas also less flatteringly referred to as the Vice Canal, on account of the quantity of drugs and guns\nthat made their way into the city of Port Massy from further upstream.

        "text": "that made their way into the city of Port Massy from further upstream. This sort of event was routine\nfor Reams, but he was uneasy tonight because of the nature of the goods. Willum Reams was a smart\nand ruthless foreman, well respected in the Port Massy underworld, but he was cautious by nature.\nUnlike his Boss, he didn’t live lavishly and draw attention to himself; he dressed conservatively and\ndrove a perfectly ordinary and reliable Brock sedan. He was a rich man, but he kept his money\ncarefully stashed away and he ran all his jobs with a clear eye for the numbers. Boss Kromner valued\nhim because he never forgot the first and most important job of a foreman, which was to make money\nfor the Crew.\nReams disagreed with his Boss about getting into the jade business. There was money to be\nmade, no question: The Southside Crew already had buyers lined up for the jade that the kecks were\nselling to them. Rich collectors, other Crews, private militia, mercenaries, and security contractors,\neven that cult in the north led by that religious nut claiming to be the reincarnation of the Seer—it\nseemed everyone wanted to get their hands on the green rocks. The stuff had been around for\nthousands of years, but people were acting as if it were newly discovered. Reams didn’t trust in the\nwisdom of the crowd. Most people were stupid, and in his opinion, jade was too risky. It would bring\ndown too much heat; the government thought of gambling and drugs as moral failings that destroyed\nthe user but weren’t a threat to the real power in the country, which were the Trade Societies. Jade,\nhowever, could strengthen armed and dangerous organizations that would pose a real threat to law\nenforcement and those in authority. Because you couldn’t have jade without shine, there was bound to\nbe a crackdown on the drug trade as well, which would jeopardize the Crew’s most traditionally\nlucrative business.\nThe biggest problem, though, in Skinny Reams’s book, was that dealing in jade meant dealing\nwith the kecks. Reams could do business with the wesps and the ’guts, even the shotties and the tunks\nif he had to, but there was something about the kecks that he especially didn’t like. They were\nunnatural, and he didn’t trust them at all.\nHe could tell that his men were edgy as well; Pats came over and said, “Seer’s balls, Skinny,\nhow much longer we got to stand out here freezing our asses off? They weren’t this late before.\nSomething’s wrong.” Reams could understand his coat’s suspicion; to reduce the risk of interception\nby the authorities, the entire quantity of jade had been split up into four shipments, transported into\nthe harbor three to six weeks apart, passed under the noses of port inspection with the help of the\ndockworkers in the Wormingwood Crew, and delivered to Reams at different points along the river.\nThe first shipments had gone smoothly, so there was no reason to believe that this one would not\nproceed in the same way, except that if the kecks wanted to screw them over, this would be their final\nopportunity.\nAt that moment, the sound of a motorboat engine quieted Pats. The boat’s headlights emerged\nfrom beneath the gloom of the bridge and swung around the edge of the dock, pulling up to the pier"

The boat’s headlights emerged\nfrom beneath the gloom of the bridge and swung around the edge of the dock, pulling up to the pier\nwhere Reams and his men stood. A short man with a severely pronounced limp got off the boat. He\nappeared Kekonese, but Reams thought the two dark-skinned men with him were not. Perhaps they\nwere from one of those tropical islands in the East Amaric, but it was hard to get a good look at them.\nThey worked together to lift a heavy metal box onshore. The limping keck opened the lid of the box\nand shone a flashlight down to show Reams what was inside: unpolished rocks of varying size, cut\nopen to reveal the gleam of the green gemstone within. “Twenty-five kilos,” he said. “You want to\nweigh?” Reams shook his head; neither of the prior three shipments had been under weight; in fact,\nboth had been over thirty kilos. When Reams had brought this up, the boatman had shrugged and\nsaid, “We give more, for the man in the middle to take his share.”\nThe man in the middle. That was him, the foreman. The one who did the work and who took the\nrisks, while the fat Bosses like Kromner stayed safe and warm indoors sipping brandy and smoking\ncigars on nights like this. Reams remembered the stranger who sat beside Dauk in the meeting, the\nyoung clan representative from Kekon who’d questioned Reams specifically before agreeing to the\ndeal. The kecks weren’t so uncivilized after all, if they recognized that the competence of the foreman\non the ground was the key to a successful operation and threw in a little extra to make sure he was\ncompensated for pulling everything off smoothly. So notwithstanding his skepticism of the jade trade\nas a whole, Reams took roughly five kilos of jade from each of the shipments and stored them away\nas a savings fund that he and his closest coats could move quietly on their own later without anyone\nknowing, not even the rest of the Crew. Insurance in case things took a bad turn for Kromner. The rest\nof the jade was taken to an industrial warehouse where another of Kromner’s foremen, Moth Duke,\nand his men supervised migrants wearing lead-lined gloves who cut and polished the jade to be\npacked and delivered to final customers.\nReams closed up the boxes and said to Pats, “Go get the money.” The coat went to the truck,\nreturning a few minutes later with a suitcase that he set on top of the lid of the closed box and opened\nto reveal bundled stacks of hundred thalir bills. “You want to count it?” he asked the boatman,\nsneering a little.\nThe man shook his head. “I trust Espenians to count money.” He closed up the suitcase, took it,\nand walked back toward the boat without another word. Reams motioned for Coop and Bairn to load\nthe metal box into the car. They were halfway to the vehicle when two sets of headlights pulled up in\nfront and eight men piled out of two black cars. The Breuer twins had their weapons out in an instant;\nReams pulled his Ankev pistol, but then he heard Moth Duke’s voice call out, with concern, “Skinny,"

Tell your boys to point their Fully guns somewhere else, for fuck’s sake.”\nDuke’s coats were carrying Fullerton submachine guns and aiming them all over the pier. Coop and\nBairn started to lower their weapons, but Reams kept his own gun raised. “What’s this about, Moth?\nWhy the fuck are you here instead of at the warehouse waiting for us?”\n“We heard there was going to be heat, Skinny, that it was a setup.” Duke’s large frame came\nstriding ahead. He stood in front of his men, silhouetted by the glare of the headlights. Reams had\nalways thought the man looked like an ape in a suit. “So we came to make sure you were all right, to\nback you up if the kecks pulled something. Did you get the rocks?”\n“Yeah, we got them,” Reams said.\n“All of them?” Duke asked, and in those three words, in the particular tone of greed with which\nthey were spoken, Reams understood in an instant that he’d been betrayed. He turned and ran for the\npier. Moth Duke’s coats opened fire, chopping Coop and Bairn apart with bullets. The motorboat’s\nengine roared as it took off in a panic; lead peppered its hull and Reams got a glimpse of the keck\nboatman toppling backward, the suitcase in his hand tumbling through the air and overboard.\nReams flung himself into the black water. It swallowed him up with a shock of cold so painful\nthat for a moment he thought he’d been shot dead after all. Then he felt himself sinking into the\nCamres, imagined his body coming to rest on the bottom of the polluted river alongside the bones of\nthe men he’d put there over the years, and the furious instinct for survival snapped his mind back into\nplace. Reams struggled free of the shoes and wool coat that dragged him down, then dove and swam,\nunable to see a thing and not knowing if and where he would emerge, not knowing if Pats and Carson\nor any of his other coats were still alive, but certain of one thing.\nMoth Duke wouldn’t dare turn on a fellow foreman without tacit approval. Which meant Boss\nKromner—the man Skinny had served well and for many years—wanted him dead.\nCHAPTER\n45\nA Promise in the Park\nW\nen was annoyed with her husband. Of course she understood that the demands on the Pillar’s time\nwere great, and his responsibilities to the clan unavoidably took precedence over everything else, but\nthat did not make her feel better at the moment. When Hilo was with the family, he was playful and\nattentive, roughhousing with the boys, chasing them, listening to the small children talk as if there\nwas nothing else on his mind. However, when some issue in the clan needed attention, he was\ninclined to deal with it personally as soon as possible, which meant that anticipated family activities\nwere never certain. A downpour the night before had brought the summer heat down to a pleasant\ntemperature, making it a perfect day for a picnic outing, but Hilo was unable to spend time with them\nas he’d said he would; instead he’d been shut behind the closed doors of the study for several hours"

After that, he’d agreed to see\nsome representatives from a humanitarian aid group, and then he and the Weather Man had meetings\ndowntown with Lantern Men all afternoon.\nWen made breakfast for her brothers and her sons, then fed the baby and packed a bag for the\ntrip she’d planned to the park. Niko and Ru were unhappy that their father would not be coming on\nthe adventure and were pestering Kehn for attention instead. He was often indulgent with the boys\nand snuck them treats when Wen wasn’t looking, but when he sat down to breakfast without offering\nanything of sufficient interest, they fell to bickering over the same water gun, shoving each other until\nRu began to cry. Kehn ignored the noise and continued flipping through the newspaper, but Tar\nshouted, “Hey!” He pulled the boys apart and deposited them into separate chairs at the table. “No\nfighting. Brothers shouldn’t fight.”\n“He pushed me,” Niko protested. “He’s always taking my stuff!”\n“Be quiet and listen to your uncle Tar,” Wen admonished, filling water bottles.\nTar leveled a stern finger in Niko’s face. “He’s your little brother. You’ve got to be nice to him,\nbecause when you grow up, the two of you have to stick together, understand? You have to look out\nfor each other. That way people know if they ever give trouble to one of you, they’re sure to get\ntrouble back from the other.” Niko stared down at his plate, sulking. Tar said, “You don’t think it’s\ntrue? The men who murdered your da when you were just a baby, one of them thought he got away\nwith it, but your uncle went after him and found him. You know what he did to that bad man?”\n“He killed him.” Niko had heard this story already.\nTar picked up a trio of grapes and held them in front of the boy’s face. “He put jade stones in his\nmouth and buried him alive.” He popped the grapes into Niko’s mouth and clamped his hand over the\nboy’s mouth, giving him a teasing shake before letting him go and ruffling his hair affectionately.\n“That’s why no one messes with your uncles. So stick together; I don’t want to see you two annoying\nyour ma, fighting over some stupid thing, you ought to act better than that.”\n“Finish your breakfast and then we’re going to the park,” Wen reminded them.\nKehn offered to drive them—he had no plans besides meeting to train a few of his newer Fists,\nbefore spending a relaxed afternoon with Lina, who was pregnant and on bedrest—but Wen had\npromised the boys that they would take the bus.

The task\nwould be less aggravating if Jaya, at six months old, was not the fussiest of all Wen’s children. She\nwould not stand to be put down in the carriage for even five minutes.

Over the past\nfew years, she’d continued to meet informers at the Celestial Radiance on a reduced schedule, but felt\nthere was more she could do.

She saw the white\nDuchesse Priza pull up to the curb beside the park, and for a hopeful second she thought that Hilo’s\nschedule had miraculously cleared and he had come in person to join them. Then she saw her brother\nat the wheel and deduced that the Pillar was still busy and had asked Kehn to go in his place to pick\nthem up. Wen called the boys back from where they were running around on the playground and told\nthem it was time to go. She put Jaya in the carriage and pushed it toward the car with one hand,\ncarrying Ru on her hip with the other. Kehn opened the door to get out and meet them.\nThe Duchesse exploded in a ball of fire.\nOne second it was there; in the next, Wen was stumbling backward, a scream strangling in her\nthroat. Out of instinct, she seized Niko and yanked him close to her, turning her back to shield him\nand Ru from the heat of the inferno, which she could feel against her skin even from fifty meters\naway. When she looked over her shoulder, she saw that the windows and doors of the Pillar’s\ndistinctive white sedan were gone. Twisted pieces of metal littered the street; flames and smoke\npoured from the openings of the wreckage. Parents ran for their children, screaming.\n“Niko, hold on to the side of Jaya’s baby carriage and don’t let go,” she ordered her oldest child.\n“We’re going to cross the street, now, quickly; stay with Mama and don’t look back.” Wen pushed the\ncarriage in the opposite direction of the burning car, still holding on to Ru and making sure Niko did\nas she said. All three of the kids were crying with fear. All around her people were running; some\nrunning away from the scene of the explosion, some running toward it. There was shouting and\ndistant sirens; none of it registered for Wen. Her brother was dead, she knew that. She and her\nchildren were still in danger. She walked with single-minded purpose, concentrating on maneuvering\nthe wheels of Jaya’s carriage over the lawn, until they reached the street on the other side. Her hands\nwere coated with sweat, but she was astounded by how calm she felt. They crossed the intersection at\nthe corner, and Wen went up to the first storefront with a white lantern hanging in its window. It was a\nboutique men’s clothing shop; tailored suits, vests, and felt hats adorned the mannequins standing in\nthe display window. Two salespeople were standing by the door, peering out at the smoke and\ncommotion."

Two salespeople were standing by the door, peering out at the smoke and\ncommotion.\nWen scooped Jaya up in her arms, pushed the door open with her shoulder, and hustled all three\nof the children inside. “Who is the Lantern Man of the store?” Wen asked the nearest salesperson. A\ntall man with white hair came out from the back room. He raised thin eyebrows in confusion and mild\nalarm at the sight of Wen and the three small children. Before the store owner could utter a word, Wen\nsaid, “My name is Kaul Maik Wen. Kaul Hiloshudon, the Pillar of No Peak, is my husband, and these\nare his children. I need to use your phone to call him right away. We’ll need to wait out of sight in the\nback room of your store until he arrives to get us. If anyone comes in asking if you’ve seen us, say no\nunless you’re certain they’re Green Bones of No Peak.” When the store owner stared at her aghast,\nWen reminded him, “You’re a Lantern Man of the clan so I know you’re a friend who we can trust to\nhelp us in any way.”\nThe store owner opened and closed his mouth once, then swallowed noisily and said, “Of course,\nMrs. Kaul, come with me.” He hurried Wen into his own office, a small space filled with fabric\nsamples and catalogs, and picked up the receiver of his phone, which he handed to her. Wen dialed\nthe main house. No one picked up. She depressed the receiver and called the Weather Man’s office.\nShae’s secretary informed her that both the Weather Man and the Pillar had gone to a meeting at the\nWhite Lantern Club. Wen told her to send someone to inform them right away that something terrible\nhad happened. She left the number of the store and hung up.\nHilo arrived twenty minutes later. By then, firefighters had put out the blaze, and a dozen of the clan’s\nGreen Bones and the Janloon city police were swarming the park and its surrounding streets. Wen\nremained in the back room of the clothing shop and did not go out to see what was happening or to\nfind out if any remains of her brother Kehn had been recovered. If the bomb had gone off two minutes\nlater, she and her children would all be dead. Her only thought now was to keep them all safe and out\nof sight of enemies who might still be watching the area. The store staff had brought whatever things\nthey could find to distract the boys: paper and pencils, a package of crackers, some old catalogs, a box\nof chalk. Wen sat on the floor, trying to entertain Niko by drawing pictures with him. She rocked Jaya\nin her arms and fed crackers to Ru. When she heard the shop door bang open and Hilo’s voice calling\nher name, Wen ran out to the front of the store and all but fell against her husband in a paroxysm of\nrelief.\nHilo’s arms were shaking as they held her, so tightly she was nearly immobilized in his grip. His\nface was bone white with fear. Wen had never seen her husband truly afraid before, and that more\nthan anything made what had happened seem real.

Up until now, for the sake of keeping herself and\nthe children calm, she hadn’t shed a tear, hadn’t so much as let more than a quaver of emotion into\nher voice, but now she broke into choked sobs.\nNiko and Ru ran out and clung to Hilo’s legs; he bent and pulled the boys to his chest, kissing\nboth of their heads and faces, ignoring the watching store staff and the posse of Green Bones who had\nfollowed him in. When he straightened up again, the color had returned to his face, and he said, with\nall of his usual quick, hard authority, “Juen, bring two of your Fingers with you and take my family\nback to the house. I’m trusting you with their lives.”\nThe First Fist said, “Right away, Kaul-jen.”\n“Shae will meet you at home,” Hilo told Wen. “I’ll be back as soon as I can.”\nWen whispered, “Does Tar know yet?” Hilo shook his head, looking stricken, and Wen felt the\ntears that had stopped threaten to start up again. Her brothers had always been two sides of one coin;\nnothing could come between them. How could Tar live without his older brother?\n“Go home now,” Hilo said gently but firmly. “Take care of the kids.”\nWen seized her husband’s arm with an insistence that surprised him, that surprised even herself.\n“Tell me that you’ll find the people who did this.” Inside, she was toppling, the last of her composure\ndisintegrating in a roaring, incoherent firestorm, yet her voice emerged as a quiet hiss. “No matter\nwho or where they are, or how long it takes. Swear to me that you’ll find them and kill them.”\nShe searched his face and found what she needed, the black danger in his eyes, the shock and\nfear that had been there darkening into the promise of violence. Hilo put his hands on either side of\nher head and pressed his forehead to hers. “I swear it.”\nCHAPTER\n46\nUnforgivable\nS\nhae rushed home from the Financial District to discover that the Kaul estate had been turned into a\nfortress. Only immediate family members and Hilo’s most trusted Fists were being allowed in or out\nof the grounds. Judging by when he’d left the house, Maik Kehn had driven the Duchesse Priza\nstraight to the park without stopping anywhere in between so the only explanation was that someone\nhad gained access to the vehicle and planted a timed explosive on it while it was in the family garage.\nThe cowardly attack had come from within.\nShae could barely comprehend the idea. All visitors to the estate were members of the clan or\nknown affiliates. The culprits might still be on or near the grounds. The guards and estate staff were\nbeing individually questioned. The leaders of the tributary Stone Cup clan, who’d been meeting with\nHilo earlier that day, were being rounded up, as were the representatives from the nonprofit group.

Shae was not sure if Kehn’s wife had been told of his death yet. It was\nnot hard to deduce that the bomb had been meant for Hilo; everyone in the city knew that the\nmonstrous white Duchesse was his car. Kehn had driven it out to pick up Wen and the kids at Hilo’s\nrequest; his own muscular black Victor MX Sport was in an automobile shop getting a new\ncarburetor.\nShae’s working assumption was that Ayt Mada was behind the attack. Two years of supposed\npeace between the clans was no reason to believe that Ayt had set aside her long-standing goal to have\nHilo killed. Shae was on the phone in the study, on a conference call with Woon and her key staff on\nShip Street. News about the bombing was on television, and the Weather Man’s office was receiving\nanxious inquiries as to whether clan war was about to break out again. Shae did not have an answer,\nbut she told her people to make it clear that no conclusions had been reached yet. She still had doubts.\nAyt Mada whispered names in a considered and precise manner, sending assassins to do the work\nclosely. A car bombing was an impersonal, covert, gutless, and thin-blooded act, likely to harm\ninnocent bystanders and carelessly break aisho—it was not the Green Bone way.\nJuen knocked on the study door and stepped inside. His jade aura was vibrating with urgency\nand agitation. As soon as Shae ended the call, the First Fist said, “Kaul-jen…” There was a strange\nwoodenness in his voice. “A man just turned himself in at the gates. He claims to be responsible for\nthe bombing.”\nA horrible sick apprehension dropped into Shae’s stomach. With abrupt certainty, she knew she\ndid not want to see what Juen would show her, yet she stood at once and followed the Fist out of the\nhouse to where half a dozen Green Bones were gathered on the driveway, surrounding a man kneeling\non the ground. The familiarity of his aura assailed her before she saw him. Maro appeared unharmed,\nbut his beige slacks were scuffed and his blue shirt rumpled. He was sitting back on his heels with his\nshoulders hunched, his gaze on the asphalt in front of him. The sight of him on his knees, guarded by\nmen carrying moon blades, was so incongruous that disbelief overwhelmed Shae, dragged her steps to\na halt and rooted her to the ground.\nMaro saw her and began to climb to his feet. One of Juen’s men put a hand on his shoulder and\nshoved him back down roughly. Shae protested, “Let him stand up,” but Maro did not make another\nattempt to rise. He remained where he was and looked up at her with a desolate expression.\nIt did not make any sense. Maro could not have planted a car bomb. He and Shae had not ended"

He and Shae had not ended\ntheir relationship on speaking terms, a fact that saddened her and filled her with regret, but Maro was\nnot a vindictive personality. He had no clan interests, no appetite for violence, and no matter what\nanger he might feel toward her, he had nothing at all to gain from killing Hilo.\n“They weren’t supposed to hurt anyone else,” Maro said quietly. “That’s what they promised me.\nI would never have cooperated if I thought they might hurt you or the children.”\nIf there had been something nearby for Shae to hold on to, she would’ve reached out to steady\nherself. “The meeting that you asked me to set up with Hilo months ago. That was this morning.”\nUnderstanding pushed into her resisting mind like a thin blade. “That’s how the assassins got in.”\nMaro’s face crumpled like paper. “The meeting was real,” he said. “None of the Four Virtues\nstaff were in on the plan, I swear to you on my life. All I was asked to do was add a couple of fake\ncollege interns to the group at the last minute. They told me to get them through the gates to see the\nPillar, that was all. They never gave me any other details.”\nJuen drew in a breath between his teeth. The idea of an enemy trying to strike at the Pillar in his\nown home was inconceivable. All of Hilo’s meetings were approved by his Pillarman, Weather Man,\nor Horn. An aspiring murderer’s hostile intentions would be Perceived by the guards and he would\nnever get anywhere near the Pillar, nor would he escape alive. However, one or two unarmed visitors\nwith seemingly legitimate credentials and no jade, attached to an otherwise honest party, would not\nraise suspicion. Once through the gates, they could find an opportunity to wander a short distance to\nthe family garage. It was clear from Maro’s wretched look that despite his complicity in the affair, he\nhad not anticipated a planted car bomb any more than they had.\n“Who were they?” Shae felt as if she’d been stabbed and the knife was lodged in her rib cage.\n“Who approached you?”\nMaro pressed the base of one palm to his eyes. “There were three of them. The leader was half-\nShotarian and wore jade hidden. I heard the others call him Soradiyo.”\n“Barukan.” Juen spat. “I’ve heard the name Soradiyo before. He’s a rockfish recruiter who works\nfor Zapunyo.”\nThe expectant stares and auras of the surrounding Fists and Fingers were like a hot physical\npressure against Shae’s skin. She turned to Juen. “Let me talk to him alone for a few minutes.” After a\nsecond, she added in an undertone, “Please,” because as Weather Man, she had no authority over\nFists, and with Maik Kehn’s death, Juen Nu was now the acting Horn of No Peak.\nJuen shifted a slow gaze to the prisoner on the ground, then returned it to the Weather Man.

He\nmotioned for the other Green Bones to back off and take up vigilant positions elsewhere, but he\nhimself made no move to leave. “It would be irresponsible of me to leave you alone with this man,\nShae-jen,” Juen said, and Shae understood this to be less an expression of concern for her safety than\na reminder that as Horn, he was her equal, and had every right to hear what was said if it involved\nthreats to the clan. Shae did not try to argue further. The inside of her throat seemed to be swelling\nand she was afraid it would soon close up completely. She made herself walk to Maro and kneel in\nfront of him so their eyes were on the same level. “Why did you do it?” The whisper that emerged\nfrom her throat was dry and unrecognizable. Plaintive. “Did I hurt you that badly?”\nMaro’s eyes filmed with sadness. “Yes. But that’s not why.” He dropped his face into his hands.\n“They got to me, Shae. The barukan gangs are powerful in Shotar, and they’re ruthless. They found\nout about my visits and phone calls to Leyolo City.” Maro’s shoulders were shaking now and his\nvoice was muffled. “At first, they tried to blackmail me with the information. When I refused and\nignored them, they sent me photos of my father. Of my half sisters and little nieces behind the\nwindows of their homes. Close-up pictures of them in their neighborhood, at school, on the\nplayground. I was told that if I didn’t do as Soradiyo asked, something would happen to them. They\nwould never know why.”\nShae gripped Maro’s forearms and pulled his hands away from his face. “Why didn’t you tell\nme? We could’ve done something—protected your family, gone after the barukan…”\nMaro raised his eyes and the bleak accusation she saw in them dried the words in her mouth.\n“Did you tell anyone when you felt threatened? When you realized you had no choice?” he asked.\nShae could not reply. Maro had been visibly nervous the evening after Woon’s wedding, wanting to\ntalk, hoping for reconciliation. Instead of offering it to him, she’d told him the truth that she knew\nwould drive him away.\nMaro’s shoulders slumped and he turned his face away. “Soradiyo promised that if I let a word\nout to anyone, the barukan would get to my nieces sooner or later and send me their tiny fingers one\nby one. Maybe it was a bluff, but I didn’t dare call them on it. Even though my sisters are Shotarian,\nand I’m Kekonese, they welcomed me. They made me a part of their lives, of their children’s lives. I\ncould never put them in any danger.” His jaw tightened, and bitterness slid edgewise into his voice.\n“You never brought me into your life. You kept me away, kept secrets from me, didn’t even tell me\nwhen you decided to get rid of our—” He stopped, his eyes flickering toward Juen, still standing\nnearby and watching them.\nMaro jammed his lips together.

There was\nblackboard chalk on the cuffs of his sleeves, a detail that had become so familiar in the time Shae had\nknown him that she was surprised to be noticing it again now of all times, as if it were something\nnew. “You say you would’ve protected my family, but the truth is that the clans protect only\nthemselves. Would No Peak really help strangers, especially Shotarians? You won’t even go against\nthe Espenians on the issue of Oortokon refugees.” Maro shook his head slowly. “The Green Bone\nclans rule Kekon—but only Kekon. If the barukan wanted to go after my sisters’ families in Shotar,\nthey’d find a way. Who in Kekon would care, besides me? I couldn’t take such an awful risk. I knew\nthey’d try to kill your brother—why else would they want to get past the guards?—but you’d already\nchosen your clan over me; I had to choose my family’s safety over yours. I had to do as they asked.”\n“Why did you come here?” Shae cried, almost angrily. “If the barukan are as powerful as you\nsay, why didn’t you ask them to get you out of the country?”\nMaro let out a short, helpless chuckle. “Who in their right mind believes they can escape the\njustice of the clan? Green Bones have no equal when it comes to dispensing violent punishment. You\nknow that more than anyone. Once your brother whispered my name, I’d spend the rest of my life as\na dead man in waiting. At least this way, I had a chance to face you and explain myself in person.”\nThe resentment left Maro’s face and he gazed at her in sad resignation. “I never imagined this,\nShae. Dying by the blade—that’s for greener men. I would’ve been happy with books, and\nconversation, and… occasional silly romantic musicals. What we had together was real and perfect,\nfor a while.” He smiled weakly, then breathed a sigh that seemed physically laborious before dabbing\nthe edge of his sleeve to his perspiring brow and looking up stoically at Juen. “Please make it quick.”\nJuen replied unsympathetically. “Tell us what else you know about Soradiyo and the barukan\nwho contacted you. The men who came in today and set the bomb—who were they?”\n“A couple of young men who worked for Soradiyo. I can describe them, but I don’t know their\nnames. The barukan made sure I didn’t know much.” There was no deception in Maro’s aura. After\nhe’d offered up what little additional information he possessed, Juen beckoned to one of the senior\nFingers, Lott, and asked, “Did you reach the Pillar?”\nLott said, “He’s on his way.”\nJuen glanced at Maro, then at his wristwatch. There was no question of the prisoner’s guilt, but\nthis was an instance not only of treason against the clan but a murderous attack against the Pillar’s\nfamily. Any intelligent Fist would wait for direction from Hilo.\nShae got to her feet, overcome by sudden dread. “Is Maik Tar with Hilo?”\nJuen said, “I think so.”"

Any intelligent Fist would wait for direction from Hilo.\nShae got to her feet, overcome by sudden dread. “Is Maik Tar with Hilo?”\nJuen said, “I think so.”\nShae’s stomach turned over. Tar would lose his mind; he would tear Maro to pieces. He’d make\nit last for hours or days. Maybe Hilo would put an end to it, but Hilo had just lost his Horn, a man he\nconsidered a brother, and his wife and children had nearly been killed; Shae couldn’t count on him to\nbe merciful.\nSeeing the terrible realization on Shae’s face or Perceiving the spike of panic in her aura, the\nlittle remaining color drained from Maro’s face and was replaced with true fear.\nA leadening sense of déjà vu flooded into Shae’s limbs. She remembered standing in the cabin in\nOpia, facing Yun Dorupon. She’d told Maro about it: I couldn’t kill him. She’d hated Doru for years\nbut in that moment been unable to draw her blade. Now she walked toward Juen, her face a mask that\nhid every roiling emotion within her. “Juen-jen,” she said. “If you’re to be the Horn of No Peak, we’ll\nbe working together from now on. I’ve heard my brother and Maik Kehn speak highly of you, so I\nwant us to start off on the right note.” She forced moisture into her throat. “Tau Maro betrayed not\nonly the clan but my personal trust. He’s told us everything he knows, and there’s no question he’s to\ndie. Do you disagree?”\nJuen gave her a long, calculating look, but there was sympathy in it. He was not yet officially the\nHorn and it would be overstepping his authority to act on something so personal to the Kaul family\nwithout consulting the Pillar, but that was not the case for Shae, and Juen had no desire or reason to\noppose the Weather Man. “No, Kaul-jen. That’s all true.”\nShae returned to Maro and knelt back down in front of him. She had a nauseating sensation she\nmight sink into the ground. “I’m sorry,” she managed to say.\nMaro nodded gratefully. He took one of Shae’s hands and enfolded it in his own large ones, then\nbrought it up to his face and laid it against his cheek as if it might offer a vestige of comfort. “Maybe\nI’m a coward after all,” he said, “but you’re not.” He leaned into her touch, his beard tickling the\ncenter of her palm, and closed his eyes. Shae reached up and cupped both hands around the back of\nMaro’s head and neck. His life pulsed beneath her touch, the wrinkled texture of his jade aura warped\nwith anguish and regret but no longer burdened by the tension of anger or fear.\nShae felt as if she couldn’t breathe; she squeezed her eyes shut and imagined herself as a column\nof ice, a creature like Ayt Madashi, made of unwavering resolve and unflinching steel. With a stifled,\nincoherent cry, she gathered all the jade energy she could muster and Channeled into the base of\nMaro’s skull. He put up no defense at all, did not raise even the flimsiest Steel.

His energy yielded\nbeneath hers; his aura tore and fled. The vessels in his brain burst and he died in seconds.\nShe caught Maro as he fell into her arms. She lowered him to the asphalt gently, then toppled\nover his body in a shudder as the blowback of his escaping life rushed into and through her. She clung\nto the wave for a second, wanting to hang on to it, to follow it into whatever oblivion it was headed\ntoward, but it slipped past her and she was still on the asphalt with Maro’s body in her lap. Slowly,\nShae lowered him to the ground onto his back. His eyes were still closed, and his face was\ninexpressibly sad, but relaxed. Shae kissed his forehead, then both of his closed eyelids. She stood up.\nJuen and his men were gathered around, but they did not speak or move toward her.\nShe turned and walked toward the Weather Man’s house. Halfway there, the memories came—\nslowly at first, a trickle from behind a wall of spreading cracks, growing into a torrent, then sweeping\nher away like the deluge from a bursting dam. Long conversations and tender moments, the fire in\nMaro’s eyes when he was energized by an idea, the softness of his smile, the aching warmth of their\nbodies pressed together. Miraculously, she didn’t break her stride, didn’t stumble or collapse or burst\ninto a run, but her vision swam and she could barely see her own front door when she reached it.\nWhen she was inside her own house and alone at last, Shae closed the door behind her, took three\nsteps into the foyer, and crumpled to the ground with a long, silent, wordless howl, arms clutched to\nher sides, forehead pressed to the hardwood floor as if in eternal penitence.\nCHAPTER\n47\nBack to Work\nS\nhae barely left her house for a week. She dressed and emerged to attend Kehn’s funeral, but the\nentire event passed in a blur of walking, chanting, and resentful silence. Hilo was devastated by his\nHorn’s death; he kept Wen’s hand tightly clasped in his own and their children within his sight at all\ntimes. Tar broke down at the side of his brother’s grave and wept like a child. Afterward, his eyes\nwere vacant and lost, as if he was no longer present, except for one moment when Shae passed near\nhim and she felt his gaze settle on her for a moment, his aura flickering with bitterness that she had\nexecuted Maro painlessly.\nShae couldn’t bring herself to speak to Tar and tell him that she, too, grieved for Kehn. She\nhadn’t known the Maik brothers well at first, for a long time thinking of them only as her brother’s\nlackeys, but the past few years had altered that impression.

        "text": "Horn, had shared meals with him around the family dinner table, had come to know him as a loyal\nand dangerous but quietly dogged man who was at least half the reason for the productive cooperation\nbetween the two sides of the clan. Hilo had insisted that Kehn be laid to rest next to the grand Kaul\nfamily memorial instead of the small, disused patch where his ignominious father was buried, but\nfrom what Shae overheard, the explosion had not left much in the way of remains. Kehn’s ashes did\nnot take up even a fraction of the steel casket. The Horn was a dangerous role, one in which a Green\nBone might expect to lose his life for the clan—on his feet with a blade in his hand. Not like this.\nShae went back into her house. Woon once again took over the job of managing the Weather\nMan’s office in her absence. Kyanla brought meals over from the main house and left them in Shae’s\nfridge, where they remained mostly untouched. Within days of Lan’s death, she’d walked into the\noffice tower on Ship Street and taken over Doru’s office as Weather Man. When her grandfather\npassed away, she’d mourned deeply, but had gone back to work. Those tragedies had broken her\nheart, but they had not torn out a piece of her soul. This time, she couldn’t function. She had no desire\nto get out of bed, to dress, or to eat. Nor did she care to know what was going on in the clan in her\nabsence.\nShae had taken lives in combat before, but she had never thought of herself as a murderer, as she\ndid now. Everything she had done to try to keep Maro at a distance from the clan and her unavoidable\ndecisions as Weather Man had hurt and endangered him, had led to his death. She’d loved him; she\nwondered if he even knew that, if she’d ever told him. The world needed more people like Tau Maro,\nand she’d ended his life with her own hands.\nAt times in her isolation, she prayed to the gods, and at others she railed and cursed them\nbitterly. She questioned everything she had ever done; she thought about leaving Kekon again; when\nshe closed her eyes, she saw Maro’s face, so sad and full of accusation, and in helpless horror and\nremorse, she relived over and over again the moment of his death. She nursed a growing, burning,\nunquenchable hatred for the coward Zapunyo and his barukan thugs.\nYears ago, she’d argued with Hilo that they had more important things to worry about than a\nsmuggler ensconced in the Uwiwa Islands. Now she realized she’d underestimated Zapunyo in a\ncrucial way. The Kekonese took it for granted that even during an outright clan war, civilians without\njade would not be targeted.

She thought at first that it was Kyanla again, come to leave\nmore food that would go uneaten, but when she roused her sluggish sense of Perception, she\nrecognized that it was Wen. Her sister-in-law knocked on the bedroom door.\n“Sister Shae,” Wen said. “May I come in?”\nShae considered ignoring the request, but felt as if she had no right to do so. Wen had seen her\nbrother killed before her eyes and been terrified for her children’s lives. She had as much if not more\nreason to be incapacitated than Shae, and yet here she was. Shae dragged herself out of bed and\nopened the door. She realized that she must look terrible; she had been wearing the same old shirt and\npajama pants for several days, her hair was uncombed, and she suspected that if she looked in the\nmirror, she would barely recognize herself.\nWen took all this in expressionlessly. She pushed past Shae into the stuffy bedroom and opened a\nwindow, letting in a gust of air. Wen turned to face her sister-in-law and sat down on the edge of\nShae’s unmade bed. “Shae-jen,” Wen said, as if they were having a perfectly ordinary conversation, “I\nwant to go back to working for you. Not right away, but soon; I was thinking once Jaya turns nine\nmonths old. We’ve done some useful things together, but we both became too busy. In the future we\ncan do better. I’ve talked your mother into moving back to Janloon and into the guesthouse for her\nown safety and to help with the children so I can go back to work part-time.”\nShae felt as if Wen’s words were coming from some other reality in which the events of the past\ntwo weeks had not happened. She blinked and let out a noise that might’ve been a laugh of\nincredulity if her voice had been less disused. “Why are you asking me this right now?”\n“Who else would I ask?” Wen exclaimed. “You’re the Weather Man, unless you’re planning to\nresign your position.” She looked at Shae shrewdly, her expression a question. “You were willing to\ndie at the hands of Ayt Mada rather than step down. Has that changed?”\n“Now’s not a good time to ask me anything, Wen,” Shae said.\n“When would be a good time? When are you planning on coming back out?”\nShae felt a weak stir of irritation. “How can you be thinking about this right now?”\nWen crossed her arms. “I would like to hide in my room for a month as well, Shae-jen. But I\ncan’t do that. I have to take care of my children; they don’t stop needing a mother just because I am\nsuffering. I have to explain to Niko and Ru that their uncle Kehn is dead. And I have to keep up my\nstrength for Hilo, so he can concentrate on managing the clan in this time and not worry about us.”\nShe fixed Shae with a straight glare and spoke matter-of-factly. “Kehn is gone, Tar is inconsolable.\nYou’re shut in this room. The Pillar is alone right now.”\n“He has dozens of people to help him,” Shae muttered."

        "text": "You’re shut in this room. The Pillar is alone right now.”\n“He has dozens of people to help him,” Shae muttered.\n“He needs you. The family needs you, the same way we needed you after Lan was murdered,\nand after your grandfather died. Hilo needs you to help him lead No Peak. You didn’t disappear for a\nweek after any of those times.” Wen’s expression softened but remained resolute. She took her sister-\nin-law by the arm and steered Shae into sitting next to her. “This isn’t the first time we’ve been hurt,\nbut it’s the first time you feel personally responsible for what happened, because your good intentions\nturned into so much pain.”\nShae stared at the other woman. “I am responsible, Wen.” The backs of her eyes began to burn,\nand she closed them for a second before fixing them in accusation on Wen. “Don’t you blame me for\nKehn’s death? For the fact that you and your children were nearly killed?”\n“Why would I blame you?” Wen sounded exasperated. “I blame our enemies, Shae-jen, for\ntwisting someone who was dear to you to their purposes, for using him like a tool to try to destroy us.\nYou may have ended his life, but you didn’t cause his death. In our world, there’s a difference.”\n“What does this have to do with you wanting to go back to work?”\nWen got up and went to look out the bedroom window. The sunlight hurt Shae’s eyes, but Wen\nstared out into the distance steadily. “A barukan rockfish working for an Uwiwan smuggler on an\nisland hundreds of kilometers away got to us here in Janloon, at a park in our own neighborhood. The\nclan has enemies everywhere now. We’re not just fighting other Green Bones. We’re fighting the\nworld, Shae-jen. Which means that aisho will not protect my children.”\nShe turned back to face the Weather Man. “Hilo has never wanted me involved in Green Bone\nmatters. But the threats to the clan aren’t just Green Bone matters anymore.” Her voice was familiar\nin its soft and reasonable entreaty, but there was a sharp underside to it. “Our enemies are willing to\nuse any angle to attack us. The clan has lost one of the Maiks, maybe two since Tar can barely\nfunction, but not all of them. So put me to work, Shae-jen.”\nWen went to Shae’s closet. She pursed her lips as she picked out a blouse and a skirt and threw\nthem on the bed. “When you challenged Ayt Mada with a clean blade, everyone was shocked, even\nHilo, but not me. We women claw for every inch we gain in this world, and you’d worked too hard\nfor your place on Ship Street to let it be taken from you. It could still happen, if you don’t get dressed\nand leave this room. There are always people looking for signs of weakness, for chances to steal what\nwe care about away from us.” Wen walked past Shae and out the bedroom door. “Your nephews asked\nif you would be at dinner tonight and I said yes.”\nCHAPTER\n48\nThe Double Double\nB\nero was in the hospital for over a month.

        "text": "if you would be at dinner tonight and I said yes.”\nCHAPTER\n48\nThe Double Double\nB\nero was in the hospital for over a month. Even after the poison and the shine were purged from his\nbloodstream, he was too feeble to go anywhere. Weak as he already was from nearly dying of SN1\noverdose, the crushing heaviness, deadening lethargy, and sweaty panic of jade withdrawal drained\nwhat little strength Bero had left. He lay half-mad in the hospital bed next to the other patients in the\ninfirmary, alternately wishing for death and cursing all the gods and his own existence.\nThe doctors said that he was lucky, very lucky indeed. That much shine would’ve killed any\ntypical person, but Bero’s SN1 tolerance was uncommonly high—a result of regular, prolonged use of\nthe drug—and the powerful sedative that Mudt had slipped into his drink had slowed his metabolism,\nso the fatal injection had not taken effect on his organs as quickly as it ordinarily would have. His\nneighbor, Mrs. Waim, incensed at the commotion she’d heard in the middle of her daytime soap\noperas, had come out into the hallway to discover him lying half in and half out of his door and, after\na few seconds of serious deliberation about whether to save his life or let him die, had called the\nambulance to their building.\nBero remembered none of this and, if anything, was irritated that he now owed unpleasant Mrs.\nWaim his life. When he was released, it was with a hospital bill for over twenty thousand dien and a\nsimmering hatred for the world. He had his life but that was all. His jade was gone. He had no doubt\nthat Mudt would’ve stolen his stash of shine so that would be gone too. He felt as thin and wobbly as\na colt, helpless, empty-headed, and wronged beyond all sense in the world. It had taken him years—\nyears—of wanting and striving, of planning and scheming, of daring and thick blood, to pull off what\nhe had accomplished. Jade of his own and everything that came with it—money, respect, power, a\nfuture. A dangerous future, to be sure, but far better than what lay ahead of him now, which was…\nnothing.\nHe fantasized about tracking down Mudt, putting his head in a vise, and cranking it slowly until\nMudt’s eyeballs popped out of his crushed skull. He was wary, though. Mudt had twice as much jade\nnow, and Bero had none, so any encounter between them was bound to be hopelessly mismatched\neven without accounting for the fact that Bero could still barely climb a flight of stairs without feeling\ndizzy. It was the only motivation Bero had left, however, so he followed it dumbly. When he returned\nto the Rat House, though, he learned that Mudt had not been back there. He went to some of their\nother usual haunts, places where new green met and talked, and the consensus was that Mudt had not\nbeen seen or heard from in some time. The kid had taken Bero’s jade and shine and vanished entirely.\nBero returned to his apartment and did not leave. Months passed. Winter turned to spring and\nthen to summer.

        "text": "Bero returned to his apartment and did not leave. Months passed. Winter turned to spring and\nthen to summer. He ordered in food, watched television, and slept. The limp he’d had ever since he’d\nbeen beaten by the Maiks was more pronounced, and he wore an unrelenting scowl that made his face\neven more crooked. At the age of twenty-one, he looked and felt like a ghoulish old man with nothing\nleft to live for. Bero had always considered himself to be the sort of person who was not easily\ndiscouraged, but now as he lay on the sofa listlessly, barely moving except to eat, piss, or change the\nchannel, he found himself weighing various options: stepping in front of the subway train, jumping\noff the tallest building he could find, getting ahold of a gun and putting a bullet between his eyes. He\ndebated which of the ways would be quicker, more reliable, less messy. He already knew to rule out\noverdosing on drugs—very painful, too slow, not foolproof at all.\nHe counted what remained of his money. A year ago, he’d been flush with cash, but now he was\nalmost broke. He had money left for another month of rent and no income prospects in sight. Bero\nmade up his mind. One morning, he got out of bed, dressed in the cleanest clothes that remained to\nhim, shaved and brushed his teeth for the first time in days, and left his apartment, being sure to close\nthe door tightly behind him. Outside, the world was bright but washed out and blurred, made dull\nwithout jade. He went to the bank and withdrew every last dien that remained to him, then took a cab\nto Poor Man’s Road, where the biggest and best betting houses in Janloon were located. The lights\noutside of the Double Double beckoned and he stood on the sidewalk gaping at them for a minute\nbefore he went inside.\nIn Bero’s own mind, there was a logic to what he was doing. All his life, he’d ridden the winds\nof fortune. The elder Mudt had said that Bero had some strange luck of the gods on him and Bero\nknew it was true. His bad luck would turn to good, his good luck turn to bad, always the capricious\ngods would swing him one way and then slap him back in the other direction, like a relayball on a\nrope. This then, would be the final test: He would take what little remained to him in the world and\nthrow it all to the winds of luck. He would bet every last dien he had at the card tables and the\nspinning wheels, and through that, he’d know whether he was meant to keep going, whether the gods\nstill wanted him alive or not.\nBero sat down at the largest of the card tables with a glass of hoji in hand and began to play\nbeggar’s lot—a game that required almost no skill and relied mostly on luck of the draw. To his\nsurprise, he had an initial string of good hands—a copper run, a brass and silver split, and a jade pair\n—but then, as was to be expected, his luck turned for the worse, dramatically. His next three hands—\na copper pair, an iron single, and a robber’s spread—lost him all his initial winnings, and then he kept\nlosing, with steady efficiency. Bero took a generous swallow of hoji every time he lost, and two hours"

Bero took a generous swallow of hoji every time he lost, and two hours\nlater, when he was down to a quarter of the money he’d entered with, he was quite drunk. He was\nhaving a good time now, though. He grinned with fatalistic cheer as he ordered another glass of hoji,\npushed a stack of chips into the center and nodded to the dealer to deal him another hand. The dealer\nlooked at Bero and his dwindling chips with mild concern and said, for the first time, “Are you sure?”\n“Don’t stop now,” Bero exclaimed. He hadn’t felt this alive, this full of certainty, since the night\nhe’d taken the jade from Kaul Lan’s grave. “I’m almost done, keke. Once I’m out of money, I’m\ngoing to jump off the Way Away Bridge. Or maybe the roof of this casino.” He counted his chips.\n“The gods have only… ah, maybe five more chances to stop me.” The dealer obliged, and Bero\nturned over his new cards. An iron single. Bero laughed and took a swallow of hoji.\nThe dealer cleared the cards and his throat at the same time. “The gods don’t control the card\ntables, if you don’t mind me saying. Maybe you ought to take a break from playing. Whatever’s\nbothering you so badly, it can’t be worth throwing away all your money and then your life.”\n“Just what I needed,” Bero griped. “A dealer with a heart. That’s not your job.”\nThe dealer didn’t reply, but surreptitiously, he caught the eye of someone across the room and\nmade a hand gesture that Bero did not notice. Bero lost two more rounds of play. With a satisfied sigh,\nhe pushed all his remaining chips into the center of the table. “That didn’t take too long.”\n“Hold on,” said a voice behind Bero. The dealer paused, and Bero turned toward the strangest\nthing he’d ever seen: a man in a white shirt and dark blue pinstripe vest, wearing leather slip-on\nsandals. The man had no arms; his short sleeves dangled empty. A small brown monkey sat on his\nright shoulder.\n“Is this some kind of joke?” Bero said.\nThe armless man made a curt gesture with his chin. “Come with me,” he said to Bero.\n“You can’t make me,” Bero said, like a child. A stern, irritated expression came into the man’s\nface. He took a step toward Bero, angling his torso in a slightly forward lean as if he were extending\nthe arms he did not have, and pushed Bero out of his chair with a firm Deflection. Bero stumbled and\nnearly fell. He caught himself on the edge of the card table and blurted, “You can’t do that! Leave me\nalone, monkey man. I haven’t broken any rules. What’re you hassling me for?”\n“Walk,” said the man, and nudged Bero with another precise Deflection that kept him upright but\nshoved him forward.

Gamblers looked up from their games to watch them pass, but\noddly enough, none of them seemed surprised by the strange sight. The brown monkey leapt to the\nground and scampered ahead to pull the handle of a metal door that read EMPLOYEES ONLY. The\narmless man propped the door open with his foot to let Bero through and said, “Turn right. Second\ndoor.”\nBero obeyed, perhaps only because he was curious about the unusual turn of events. He was in a\nred carpeted hallway. To the left he could hear the sounds of the casino’s kitchen. To the right were\nseveral offices. The armless Green Bone directed Bero into one of them. Inside was a large desk, but\nit was very low, the height of a child’s desk, as well as a black sofa, and several framed certificates on\nthe wall that looked like awards. Behind the desk was a display shelf with a long row of bottles of\nhoji.\n“Sit down,” said the Green Bone, jerking his head toward the sofa. He pulled a foot out of its\nslipper, opened the bottom drawer of his desk cabinet, and took out a bottle of water, which he rolled\nacross the floor to Bero. “Once you’re sober, you’ll get your remaining money back and so long as\nyou promise not to kill yourself, I’ll call you a cab. You have somewhere to go? Someone to go to?”\n“What do you care?” Bero said, but he took the bottle of water and fell onto the sofa.\nThe man said, “Every once in a while, we get someone like you, someone who wants to put on a\nbit of a show for themselves before bringing down the curtains. Or maybe they’re having a bad time\nso they come here hoping to turn things around, but make it worse instead. Some of them end up\ntrying to jump off the roof of the casino or to blow their brains out in one of the premium suites. It’s\nbad for business.”\n“So who are you, the owner? Or just the casino watchdog?”\nBero said it mockingly, but the man merely shrugged. As he had no arms, the movement\nappeared odd, as if his head bobbed briefly into his torso. “When you have a good sense of\nPerception, it’s easy to notice the desperate ones. But no, I’m not the owner of the Double Double. I\nmake hoji.” He nodded toward the bottles on the shelf. Bero saw that the frames on the wall held\ncertificates for various industry awards. “The Double Double has an in-house distillery. I run the\ndistillery, and I’m an… unofficial floor manager at the casinos. I keep an eye on all of Poor Man’s\nRoad.”\n“Why don’t you have any arms?” Bero asked.\nFor a moment, the Green Bone gave him a cold and disgusted look, as if he were regretting\nhaving interfered with Bero’s original plan. Then he said, “I don’t have arms because the Horn of the\nMountain cut them off.” He pushed his chair over so it faced the sofa, then sat down facing Bero.\n“I’ve been where you are now.

I was in too much pain and\ncouldn’t see a future for myself. But a friend spoke to me at the right time and convinced me to live.\nNow the man who cut off my arms is dead, but I’m still alive, and my family and business are\nthriving. So whatever it is that brought you here, whatever wrong you’ve suffered—there’s something\non the other side of it.”\nBero muttered, “At least you still have your jade.”\nThe man leaned forward. “At least you still have your arms.”\nDespite himself, Bero had drained the entire bottle of water and now he slouched, rolling his\nhead back on the Green Bone’s black sofa. He could feel a persistent pressure behind his eyes, an\nalcohol-induced headache made worse by hours under the too-bright lights of the casino floor. “I’m in\nthis fix because of jade,” he said. “Always because of jade.” He was unable to say why he was\nadmitting this to a Green Bone of the No Peak clan, except that he had stopped caring about anything.\nHis only feeling was limp irritation that this man was trying to convince him to live when he had\nother plans. “I listened to a barukan asshole who promised me that if I worked as a rockfish for him\nfor a year, I’d earn green. But then I lost a crew to the Mountain—it wasn’t even my fault—and I\ndidn’t take the whisper work he wanted me to, so he cut me off. The fucker cut me off.” Bero wanted\nto scream thinking about it. More words rushed out of him in a drunken stream. “Then the guy I was\nworking with, he turned on me, the greasy little piss rat. I made him, and he drugged me and stole my\njade and left me to die. If I ever find him, I’m going to kill him in the worst way I can think of.”\nBero opened his eyes and sneered at the Green Bone, daring him. “So yeah, I’m a thief and a\nsmuggler. I worked with barukan gangsters and Uwiwan scavengers to steal jade from the mines. You\nstill plan on keeping me alive now, jen?”\nFrom the edge of the desk, the perched brown monkey stared at Bero. For a minute, the armless\nGreen Bone did the same. Then he tapped the phone on the table with his big toe. The monkey leapt\nover and brought the receiver to the man’s head. The Green Bone held it between shoulder and ear\nand dialed a number. His gaze remained on Bero the whole time.\nBero heard the click of the phone being answered on the other end. “Lott-jen, it’s Eiten,” said the\narmless Green Bone. “Can you come over to the Double Double? I have someone here in my office\nthat the Pillar might be interested in.”\nCHAPTER\n49\nCleaning out the Rat House\nW\nhen Hilo arrived at the Double Double, Eiten met him at the entrance. “Who is this kid you\nfound?” Hilo asked, as his former Fist led him across the floor and through the back doors to the"

Gamblers paused in their games to salute the Pillar as he passed. Hilo\nnoticed a few Espenian servicemen at the bar, but they were behaving themselves. Poor Man’s Road,\nwhich No Peak had fought so hard to conquer from the Mountain, had proven to be a troublesome\narea over the last two years, but there had been no recent incidents.\n“A broke and drunk former rockfish who showed up with a story about being cheated by a\nbarukan named Soradiyo,” Eiten said. “Juen and Lott have been talking to him, but we thought you\nmight want to ask him questions yourself, Hilo-jen.” In the dim, climate-controlled storage room,\nthey walked past rows of large casks, stacked to the ceiling on wooden frames and filled with aging\nhoji. Cursed Beauty distillery had expanded considerably and begun exporting product to overseas\nmarkets. Seeing his friend’s business doing so well gave Hilo a small reason to smile in what had\notherwise been a tragic and terrible past few weeks.\n“I’m glad I can count on you to keep your eyes and ears open, my friend,” Hilo said.\nEiten dismissed the comment with a shake of his head. “I owe everything to you, Hilo-jen; I only\nwish I could be more helpful. If this kid is telling the truth, maybe his appearance is a gift from the\ngods that’ll help us find and punish the half bone dogs who killed Kehn.”\nHilo did not dare get his hopes up so quickly, but he nodded. He already had every Fist and\nFinger in the clan hunting down any information about Zapunyo’s agents and searching for the\nbarukan that Tau Maro had named, but so far it had been like chasing a ghost.\nHilo regretted not taking Kehn’s warnings about Zapunyo more seriously. He’d been\npreoccupied with inciting division in the Mountain and hoodwinking the Crews. Zapunyo, he’d\ntreated more as a persistently offensive problem than a truly dangerous enemy. After all, smugglers\nand drug dealers were like weeds; if you pulled one out, another might take its place, so in a way,\nthere was no rush. Zapunyo, however, was in a criminal class of his own. Hilo realized he’d lost sight\nof that fact. When the informer had been delivered to No Peak in pieces, he’d made the mistake of not\ntreating an Uwiwan death as seriously as a Kekonese one; he should’ve understood the threat and\nretaliated against Zapunyo’s transgression forcefully and immediately. That error in judgment would\nalways haunt him.\nEiten strode ahead and Deflected open a swinging metal door that led into the large, clean\nconcrete chamber occupied by the distillery’s fermentation tanks. Juen and Lott were standing around\na portable wooden table. On the table were city and country maps marked up with colored dots and\nhandwritten notes.

Sitting hunched in a metal folding chair behind the table was a skinny, pallid\nyoung man with bloodshot eyes and a sour face that looked as if it had been broken and mended at\nleast once in his life. Juen and Lott broke off their conversation to salute the Pillar as he entered. Juen\ngestured to the notes and maps and said, “Here’s what we know so far, Hilo-jen. Places in the city\nwhere Soradiyo goes to recruit or meet with his local rockfish, mostly illegal clubs for jade thieves\nand shine addicts. Also, drop-off and pick-up sites along the coast and in the mountains for Zapunyo’s\nscrap-picking operations. Vuay, Iyn, and Vin have sent Fingers to corroborate—quietly, so we don’t\nspook anyone before we decide to act.”\nOne thing Hilo was grateful for was how quickly and matter-of-factly Juen had assumed the role\nof Horn. Juen was not an immediate relative like Kehn had been, and he needed to learn how to have\na stronger presence when dealing with the public and clan outsiders, but he was an operational\nmastermind who could manage a remarkable number of details, and right now that was particularly\nuseful. Hilo studied the information that his men had compiled and asked questions until he was\nsatisfied that they’d done or were in the process of doing their due diligence.\nHilo turned his attention to the young man, the unexpected informer. There was something\nfamiliar about him, about his unbalanced face and the sullen, resentful intensity of his eyes. “You say\nyou worked for Soradiyo,” Hilo said. “Why are you betraying him?”\nThe young man glanced at Hilo with unease before scowling at the ground. “That barukan hung\nme out,” he muttered. “I was supposed to be a big dog like he promised, I was supposed to get jade,\nbut he hung me out. All the new green are pussies. So fuck them all, and fuck Soradiyo. They don’t\ndeserve what they have. They don’t deserve jade at all.”\nHilo wondered if the young man was still drunk; he certainly sounded it. Some of his angry\nmumbling was barely audible, and he seemed to be talking half to himself. If there was any\nPerceivable cunning or deception in him, though, it was blotted out by an impression of\noverwhelming black bitterness. Whenever he happened to glance at the Pillar, he twitched a little and\nlooked away. Hilo tried to think of where he’d seen the man’s crooked face, because he had a feeling\nthat he’d come across it before. He asked curiously, “You’ve smuggled jade and dealt shine and\nworked for foreign criminals. Aren’t you afraid we’ll kill you after this?”\nThe man looked around the stark concrete room and metal tanks as if noticing for the first time\nthat there were no windows and only one exit, and that no one from the busy casino floor would be\nable to hear anything that was said or done in here. He sniffed and shrugged.\nThere was still something disquietingly familiar about the man.

The man tensed but did so reluctantly. “How do I know you?”\nThis time, the informer winced visibly, as if he’d been slapped, and in that instant, Hilo\nrecognized him. “The Twice Lucky,” he said. When the man twitched again and nodded, Hilo\nlaughed. Juen, Lott, and Eiten were looking at him questioningly. “Years ago, the Maiks and I caught\na couple of dock brats trying to steal jade off that old drunk Shon Ju,” Hilo explained. “I was all for\nsnapping this one’s neck, but Lan let him go.” Hilo chuckled again at the irony. “Jade fevered, like I\nsaid at the time, so it’s no surprise he ended up as a rockfish. But now he’s here, giving us the keys to\nZapunyo’s kingdom.” Hilo shook his head, amused and also struck with sadness to think that Lan’s\noptimism, his softheartedness, had come back to help at such a time and in such a way. You have to\ngive people a chance, that’s what his brother had said.\nHilo leaned over the small table and seized the young man’s chin in a grip of iron. “I said I’d kill\nyou if I saw you again, remember?” he said in a low voice. The man’s sunken eyes widened, but Hilo\nreleased him with a quick shake and sighed. “I guess I can’t keep that promise after all. Not after\nyou’ve been helpful to the clan, and with Lan watching.”\nWithin hours of the car bombing, Ayt Mada had issued a public statement condemning the attack and\ncategorically denying the Mountain’s involvement. Five innocent bystanders, including a child, had\nsuffered non-life-threatening injuries from the blast, and Ayt adamantly declared that this was the\nwork of criminals, as no Green Bone of the Mountain would engage in such a reprehensible breach of\naisho. She expressed the Mountain’s sincere condolences to the Kaul and Maik families and vowed to\naid them in any way possible to bring those responsible to justice.\nIt was all very convincing, Hilo admitted, and he intended to hold Ayt Mada to her public\nsentiments. Some of the leads he and his men had gathered led straight into Mountain territory; No\nPeak could not effectively go after Zapunyo’s organization without cooperation from their rivals. Hilo\nsent Juen to meet with Nau Suen and request that the Mountain honor the truce between the clans and\nhelp, or at least not hinder, No Peak’s vengeance against the foreign jade smuggler.\nWith Nau Suen’s permission, Juen took three of his best Green Bones with him into the Factory,\nthe Mountain training hall in Spearpoint. Hilo waited outside in the Victor MX with another half\ndozen men, two other cars, and no small amount of impatient anxiety.

He rested his arm out the\nwindow and smoked two cigarettes in a row, staring at the clouds scudding across the sky over resting\nfreight cars. Lan had fought a clean-bladed duel on this very spot four years ago. Hilo found it\ndifficult to even believe that had happened in this same lifetime. Lan shouldn’t have fought, he\nthought now. We should’ve stormed that fucking building with everything we had.\nJuen and his men returned thirty minutes later. Hilo got out of the car to hear what his Horn had\nto say. “They’ve agreed to let us enter Mountain territory and to go after the targets we name, so long\nas they’re part of it. We have to share everything we know about Zapunyo’s organization, and Nau’s\nGreen Bones will be right there with us on any action we take within their borders.” Hilo nodded; he\nhadn’t expected to get assistance for nothing. Naturally, the Mountain would want to lay claim to the\njade, money, and shine seized in their own districts.\nJuen frowned. “I see why some people think Nau can read minds. He doesn’t look like much, but\nhe makes the skin crawl. He’s not like any Horn I’ve ever met.”\n“That’s because he’s not. He’s Ayt Mada’s snake, and he’d slit all our throats in our sleep if he\ngot the chance.” Hilo got back into the car. “We have to move fast. Work with him.”\nThey took out the Rat House the following evening. Anyone who saw the Pillar that night and on the\nseveral more that followed would think they were seeing the Kaul Hiloshudon from six years ago, the\nfearsome young Horn with his posse of warriors, studded with jade and bristling with weaponry. They\nwould be mistaken, Hilo thought grimly. His thirty-second birthday was coming up, but he didn’t\nlook or feel as young anymore; he arrived in the Coinwash district in Kehn’s Victor MX Sport instead\nof his signature white Duchesse, and Kehn himself was not at his side. Tar was there, however; the\nyounger Maik had an unhinged look about him, something akin to a shipwrecked sailor or a starved\nanimal, but Hilo could not possibly have left him behind, not in this.\nIn addition to Tar, he had with him Lott, Vin, and three Fingers. Elsewhere in the city, Juen,\nVuay, and Iyn were leading simultaneous raids on other hideouts. Hilo paused on the street before\nthey entered the club. “No killing until we find Soradiyo,” he reminded his men.\nThey tore off the door and strode into the building. There were about a dozen people inside with\nunfamiliar jade auras, scratchy and awkward, untrained, flaring into terror and hostility as the Green\nBones burst into the room. Half a dozen men leapt up from their places and drew guns, but in the\nclose quarters, only a few managed to get off any shots before the Green Bones were upon them.\nMoving in a blur of Strength, Hilo slid his head out of the way of one man’s aim, seized the\noutstretched arm, and slammed the heel of his other hand upward into the man’s limb, just above the"

The gun went off, drowning out the man’s howl of\npain. Hilo crushed the side of the man’s knee, grabbed his hair as he began to fall, and slammed the\ncrook’s face into the nearest table as he went down.\nHilo took one, two steps—off a chair and then the bar top—pivoting as he leapt Light from the\ncounter and off the nearest wall, drawing his talon knife in midair and Steeling as he came down with\nhis full weight on the attacker he’d Perceived behind him. They crashed together to the concrete floor.\nHilo pulled the man’s head back and nearly cut his throat before he remembered his own admonition\nto leave the occupants alive. His opponent twisted around on the sticky ground, bellowing and\nheaving with desperate, unfocused Strength as he tried to seize Hilo in a headlock. He was a burly,\npowerful man and might’ve succeeded if Hilo didn’t act quickly; he pushed the palm of his hand into\nthe man’s back, Channeling into his spine, rupturing the discs between the vertebrae. The man’s torso\nand legs went rigid with agony and he lay unresisting on the ground as Hilo got back to his feet and\nbrushed off his clothes.\nSeveral other of the Rat House’s denizens were unconscious or incapacitated, though Hilo\nsuspected that a few of them did not have long to live. Tar, moon blade in hand, had severed one\nman’s arm at the elbow and opened the belly of another who was now kneeling on the ground, feebly\nmoaning and holding his protruding entrails. The rest of the new green were cowering on the ground\nwith their heads to the floor, begging for mercy. Lott and Vin, their jade auras humming with\nalertness, were going around confiscating weapons and collecting the illegal jade—rings, pendants,\nbelts. Hilo stood in the center of the dim room and took a good look around. The Rat House was a\nsorry, stuffy place—one half of it covered with mats, broken concrete blocks, sandbags, and other\nequipment for people to practice jade abilities, and the other half full of dingy tables in front of a\nsurprisingly well-stocked bar. Two metal needle disposal boxes hung on the wall along with\nhandwritten flyers with tips for safe and hygienic shine injection.\n“All of you are jade thieves who don’t deserve to live,” Hilo announced. “Whether you worked\nfor the Mountain, or foreign criminals, or are just too jade fevered and stupid to know any better,\nyou’re all in this situation because you didn’t change your ways when you had the chance.” He\nallowed his words to sink in as he paced slowly across the floor, examining faces, comparing them to\nthe drawings he’d had made from descriptions and shown to every Green Bone in No Peak.\n“I don’t see who I’m looking for,” he said, reaching the end of the room and turning around.\n“I’m going to give you collectively one minute to tell me where to find the barukan Soradiyo.

I know\nhe comes here to recruit scum like you as rockfish for Zapunyo’s smuggling operation, so don’t\npretend you don’t know who I’m talking about. And I want the locations of any other hideouts in the\ncity where the new green can be found. If I get what I want in one minute, you’ll lose your jade but\nkeep your lives. If I don’t, you’ll lose both.”\nIyn Ro and her Fingers caught Soradiyo two days later. The smuggler had spent the weeks after the\nbombing hiding in the storeroom of a gym in a part of the Stump well known as an Uwiwan ethnic\nghetto. Upon learning that the Mountain was allowing No Peak into its territories to hunt for him,\nSoradiyo attempted to flee the country. He would’ve stood a better chance of escaping detection if\nhe’d taken off his jade, but in his haste and desperation, he failed to think of that. Iyn’s search team\nPerceived a stowaway on a boat bound for the Uwiwa Islands. Soradiyo was jade-stripped and taken\nto a warehouse in the Docks where Tar took charge of interrogating him.\n“The barukan are fucking pussies,” Tar said, when Hilo arrived some hours later. “He gave up\neverything we wanted. The names of the two rockfish he hired to plant the bomb, plus details about\nZapunyo’s operations: the docking locations of the picking crews, the mine sites they scavenge from,\nhow they get the jade scrap out of the country, the names and identities of the other agents in Janloon\nand the top people in Zapunyo’s organization, the police and government officials that uwie smuggler\nhas in his pocket, and the defenses around his mansion in Tialuhiya.”\n“Did you write it all down?” Hilo asked.\n“Pano did,” Tar said, indicating the Finger behind him, who was holding a clipboard with notes\nand who looked a little sick in the face after this unpleasant assignment. Hilo took the clipboard from\nhim and read through all of it, carefully. When he was done, the Pillar nodded in satisfaction and\nhanded it back, then told Tar and Pano to wait outside. He went into the windowless room where\nSoradiyo hung half-naked with his arms chained over his head, covered in blood and bruises and\nshaking uncontrollably from jade withdrawal. Hilo waited until the man roused his attention weakly.\n“Are you here to kill me?” the barukan asked hopefully, his Shotarian accent slurred through a dry\nthroat and cracked lips.\nHilo had two four-ounce juice boxes with him; he always had a couple of them in the car, along\nwith some snacks, for times when his sons got hungry or thirsty while on outings. The oppressive\nhumidity of Janloon’s summer was even worse here in the windowless warehouse than it was outside.\nThe stale air stank strongly of the prisoner’s piss, which stained a splotchy circle of concrete around\nhis feet.

He unwrapped the plastic around the tiny straw, punched it into the\njuice box’s small foil circle, and held it out to Soradiyo, who clamped his bloodied lips around it and\nsucked back the entire drink in one desperate mouthful. He eyed the second box in pleading, but the\nPillar did not give it to him.\n“One more question,” Hilo said. “Who gave the order? Ayt or Zapunyo?”\n“Zapunyo,” Soradiyo rasped. “With the Mountain’s encouragement.” He struggled to shift, to\ntake some of the body weight off his straining shoulders. “Last year, Nau Suen contacted me. He\nwanted me to act as the go-between for his clan to talk to Zapunyo. It wasn’t like I had much of a\nchoice; the bastard was killing my scrap pickers and rockfish as fast as I could hire them. The\nMountain said it was obligated to uphold its publicly declared agreement with No Peak and do its part\nto oppose smuggling. But if the Mountain was in sole control, things might be different. Perhaps\nsome sort of accommodation could be reached. That’s what was suggested.”\n“And Zapunyo bought it.”\n“He saw it for what it was: a trade. The clans were making it too hard for us, costing Zapunyo\ntoo much. Ayt was saying that if we got rid of you, she would let us eat.”\nHilo nodded. “It must sting that Ayt gave you up so quickly, that you’re in here now.”\nSoradiyo made a motion that might’ve been an attempted shrug. “The price of failure. It’s no big\nsurprise. And it’s not as if I’m telling you anything that you didn’t already suspect.”\n“No,” Hilo agreed. “Where do you want your body sent? Do you have relatives?”\nSoradiyo closed his eyes. “Yes, in Oortoko, but because of the war, I’m not sure where they are\nnow, and I don’t want them to see me like this. Send me to my cousin Iyilo in the Uwiwa Islands.\nHe’ll bury me, and it’ll serve him right to feel guilty for leaving me here on my own, and for what\nhappened.”\nHilo said nothing more. He drew his talon knife and opened the barukan’s throat in one swift\nmotion. Soradiyo’s wracked body relaxed and his chin fell forward to his chest over an apron of red.\nWhen Hilo exited, he said, “Clean him up and send him back to the Uwiwas.”\n“That piece of scum killed Kehn,” Tar exclaimed, furious emotion coloring his face. “Why’d you\nlet him off so easy? We ought to sink him into the ocean bit by fucking bit.”\nHilo silenced his Pillarman with a look that was not unsympathetic, but was stern enough to\nmake it clear that he expected no further talking back. “Soradiyo and Tau Maro might’ve planned and\ncarried out the bombing, but they were puppets on strings.” Hilo wiped and sheathed his knife. “Ayt\nMada is playing a long game.

As for Zapunyo—I warned that Uwiwan dog that if he kept reaching\nhis dirty hands into Kekon, I’d go after him, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.” The Pillar’s\nvoice flattened to an edge. “We’re going to destroy everything he’s built.”\nCHAPTER\n50\nPatience\nO\nver the following weeks, the Green Bones of No Peak led a merciless city-wide purge targeting\nillegal jade dens used by the so-called new green, rockfish, barukan, and shine dealers. Dozens of\ncriminals were beaten, jade-stripped, and imprisoned, if not outright killed. The two perpetrators that\nSoradiyo had paid to plant the car bomb fled Janloon and made it all the way to the city of Toshon on\nthe southern peninsula before being caught by members of the local Jo Sun clan. The men begged for\ntheir captors to kill them, but the Jo Sun clan handed the criminals over to No Peak as a sign of\nallegiance and good will to the Kaul family. They were not alone in their thinking; the other minor\nGreen Bone clans, the Janloon city police, and even the Mountain clan assisted or got out of the way\n—there was nothing to be gained from opposing Kaul Hilo’s rampage.\nMost Janlooners, judging by sentiment on the street and coverage in the press, approved of the\ncrackdown and saw it as necessary. The car bombing, everyone knew by now, had been the cowardly\nscheme of a Shotarian gangster working for an Uwiwan jade smuggler. While the Kekonese are\nforgiving, even comfortable, with public violence between those of equal status, the idea of\ndishonorable foreign crooks striking at a great and powerful Green Bone family and injuring innocent\npeople in the heart of an affluent Janloon neighborhood was offensive in the extreme.\nEven Ayt Mada’s prominence as a patriotic public figure was eclipsed by the return of Hilo’s\npersonal presence to the streets of Janloon. After nearly four years as Pillar, his youthful, violent\nreputation had begun to fade. Now he made no secret of the fact that he was out for blood, and people\nnodded in understanding. He replaced the destroyed Duchesse Priza with a gleaming new Duchesse\nSigna—even more intimidating than its predecessor, boasting greater horsepower and an enormous\nsilver grille. He roamed at all hours, at the head of a pack of Fists. Wherever he was sighted, people\nstepped back and touched their foreheads in nervous salute.\nThere was a time when Hilo would’ve taken satisfaction in all this, but now he had only one real\nobjective in mind that eluded him: killing Zapunyo. “It doesn’t matter how many of his scrap pickers\nand rockfish we send to the grave, Zapunyo always has more,” the Pillar growled, dropping a map of\nTialuhiya onto the coffee table in front of Shae, Juen, and Tar, and pacing around the study. “Life is\ncheap in the Uwiwa Islands; in less than a year he could replace everything we’ve taken from him.\nMeanwhile, he’s sipping papaya cocktails on the balcony over his lake.”\n“He can’t have fruit juice; he’s diabetic,” Shae pointed out.\nShe received a predictable sneer in return for her cheek. “Can you think of a way to sneak fatal"

No? Then we need to find another way to whisper his name.” He dropped\nback into the nearest armchair and said to Juen, “What are the options?”\nJuen blew out a pessimistic breath as he picked up the blurry photographs. They showed the\nperimeter of Zapunyo’s compound, taken from a distance with telephoto lenses by No Peak spies in\nthe Uwiwa Islands and supplemented with sketched blueprints based on Teije Runo’s recollection of\nthe property from his extended stay as Zapunyo’s guest. Not that Teije’s memory could be trusted all\nthat much. Juen said, “It won’t be easy. Zapunyo’s compound has all the best security that money can\nbuy. Watchtowers, guard dogs, motion sensors, security cameras, and of course his barukan\nbodyguards. He owns all the surrounding land so no one can get near him.”\n“There has to be a way to get someone into that fortress,” Hilo insisted. “Or to buy someone\nwho’s already inside. Doesn’t he have deliverymen, housekeepers, gardeners?”\n“He doesn’t let many people near him besides his sons, his doctor, and his bodyguards. Most of\nthe house staff have been working for him for years and he only hires Uwiwans from local families,\nso he can be sure they will never betray him. A few years ago, a rival shine producer tried to have\nZapunyo poisoned by his own cook. The cook was sent back to his relatives over the course of a\nweek, in seven different buckets. No one else has ever tried.”\n“Then we have to do this ourselves,” Tar said, with heat. “What are Zapunyo’s cameras and\nhired goons next to a couple dozen of our best Fists? We fight our way in and kill him.”\nJuen said, “Even if we split up and take different flights at different times, we’re not going to be\nable to fly in without Zapunyo getting wind of it.” The Uwiwa Islands still had a standing travel ban\non all Green Bones and any Kekonese nationals with suspected ties to the clans (which could be\nalmost anyone). “We could try to get into the country by boat, the same way Zapunyo moves his own\nscrap pickers. That would mean at least a couple of days at sea in a private vessel. Once we get there,\nwe’ll need to get from the coast to Zapunyo’s compound in the hills, three hundred kilometers inland.\nNo matter what, the barukan will Perceive us before we get there—they’ll have time to get Zapunyo\nto safety and to mount a defense.”\nTar turned to the Pillar. “Let me do it, Hilo-jen,” he pleaded. “When have I let you down before?\nLet me take ten Fists with me and I swear on my jade I’ll send Zapunyo to the grave.”\nShae spoke up. “I agree with all of you that we have to kill Zapunyo.” Hilo thought his sister still\nlooked pale and skinny enough for a stiff wind to blow her over, though for days, she’d been studying"

We can’t send a band of Green Bones to illegally enter another country and\nassassinate someone in a bloody showdown, no matter who he is. Zapunyo is sure to do what he did\nlast time—protect himself with local police officers that will end up dead in the fighting and on the\nnews.”\n“Who cares about some crooked Uwiwan cops?” Tar exclaimed.\n“It’ll bring down a lot of trouble on us from the Espenians,” Shae said, still speaking to Hilo.\n“You know our relationship with them is tricky. We’ve restricted jade exports and refused to\ncontribute troops to fight on their side in Oortoko, because, as you and Chancellor Son so clearly\nexplained to Secretary Corris, we Green Bones protect what’s ours, but we don’t invade other\ncountries and kill civilians without jade. This would fly in the face of that and weaken our position\nwith them. And it would undermine the diplomatic pressure the Espenians are trying to put on the\nUwiwan government to take greater responsibility for combating corruption and crime in their own\ncountry.” When Hilo frowned, she insisted, “And it’s not just the Espenians—several other countries\nhave banned civilian ownership of jade. A lot of ignorant people don’t even know the difference\nbetween Green Bones and barukan thanks to those Shotarian gangster movies. For our own good, we\nhave to be careful not to attract even more foreign attention. If we act reckless and bloodthirsty and\nshow no respect for the laws of neighboring countries, it’ll set us back in a lot of other ways,\nespecially in our alliances overseas and the businesses we’re trying to grow.”\n“The Espenians,” Tar spat. “I’m sick of how we—how you”—he glared at Shae—“think about\nthe foreigners’ feelings with every decision. Ah, how are the Espenians going to like it? What about\nwhat people here will think? They count on the clans; do you want them to think we can’t do\nanything against enemies overseas? If we’re afraid to act, to answer an offense against the clan\nbecause of what the foreign press might say about us in the newspapers, then we’re lapdogs that don’t\neven deserve our green.”\nShae turned a disdainful look on Tar, eyes narrowed at the veiled insult. “I’m not saying we give\nup. I’m saying we have to get to him in another way, one that doesn’t involve a highly public\nmassacre right in front of the man’s plantation house in Tialuhiya.”\n“Shae-jen has a point,” Juen said to Hilo. “Zapunyo has to pay for his actions, there’s no\ndisagreement among any of us about that. But we would risk a lot by sending a dozen or more of our\nbest Fists to try to strike at him head-on in his own country. Those are Fists that we need, that I need\nas Horn here in Janloon. We can’t afford to lose those lives, especially not when we know that, truce\nor not, the Mountain is still our enemy at home and will exploit any weakness.”"

We can’t afford to lose those lives, especially not when we know that, truce\nor not, the Mountain is still our enemy at home and will exploit any weakness.”\nTar’s jade aura was crackling with frustration, and when he spoke, he seemed almost near tears.\n“Then let me go alone, Hilo-jen. How can I live, otherwise? At least let me try.”\nHilo turned a look on his Pillarman that was oddly gentle and also angry. “You’re talking\nnonsense, Tar. We have to be ready to die, that’s true enough, but not if it accomplishes nothing.\nHow’re you going to face Kehn in the afterlife and not look like a fool? You think I’m going to let\nyou throw your life away? I’ve lost enough brothers already. What would Wen say?” Tar opened his\nmouth as if to argue, then closed it again as he looked away, ashamed.\nHilo sank lower into the armchair and scowled, leaning his head back. Outside the closed door of\nthe study, they could hear the pattering footsteps of the children running up and down the stairs, and\nWen calling them to eat. Hilo said quietly, “I promised my wife that I would avenge her brother and\npunish the people who put our children’s lives in danger. If I were to say what I want to do, it would\nbe exactly the same as Tar.” Hilo’s mouth hardened as he lifted his head and looked around the circle\nof his closest advisors. “But Shae’s right. She’s always had a cooler mind than me, even when she’s\nangry. I’m also thinking about what Juen said. We’ve done a lot these past few weeks, but Ayt would\nlike us to go farther than we can handle and cause problems for ourselves so she can take advantage.\nShe’s likely even counting on that, since the Mountain was encouraging the barukan to go after us this\nwhole time. So taking out Zapunyo—we can’t do it now, not this way.”\nHilo’s words were spoken reluctantly, but with finality. He got up, indicating that the meeting\nwas over, but as he did so, he put a hand on Tar’s shoulder. “I don’t know what the way is yet, but it\ntook us years to avenge Lan, remember? But we did it eventually. And that’s not even fully done yet,\nnot until the Mountain is destroyed. So we have to be patient.”\nHilo was waiting in the lounge of the Inheritance when Ven Sando boarded his boat as usual the\nfollowing Sixthday morning. The president of K-Star Freight was understandably nonplussed to see\nthe Pillar of the No Peak clan sitting by himself in one of the deck chairs with a drink that he’d taken\nfrom the onboard minibar. Ven appeared shocked, then angry, then a little frightened. The man opened\nhis mouth, but before he could say anything, Hilo raised a hand to forestall him. The Pillar stood up in\none smooth motion. “Ven-jen, I thought we were friends.”\nThe words were spoken with a chillingly soft disappointment. Ven Sando turned pale. “We are,\nKaul-jen,” the heavyset businessman protested. “Why would you think otherwise?”\n“Friends don’t make promises they don’t intend to keep,” Hilo said, walking slowly toward Ven."

That was over a year and a half ago.” Hilo\npursed his lips to one side. “With everything going on in the world these days, I can appreciate that\nthings have been busy for everyone. But my biggest problem is that Ayt Mada is still the Pillar of the\nMountain. My Weather Man tells me you’ve stopped returning her calls. I can’t help but think that\nyou’re not taking our agreement seriously.”\n“Kaul-jen, I’ve been quite vocal in my criticisms of Ayt’s leadership. I’ve had fruitful\ndiscussions about the future of the clan with innumerable influential colleagues and gathered strong\nsupport for a change in direction—I dare say a return to our more honorable roots.” Ven cleared his\nthroat forcefully and crossed his large arms. “It takes time to prepare properly for change of such\nan… irrevocable nature. I’ve overseen more than a few major business acquisitions during my long\ncareer, and can say—”\n“This isn’t a corporate acquisition,” Hilo interrupted. “Ayt Mada came from the business side as\nWeather Man, but when her father died, it only took her six days to kill her rivals and take control of\nthe Mountain. You called Ayt an inept, ambitious woman who’s made misstep after misstep. So tell\nme how is it that in nearly two years you haven’t managed to accomplish what took her six days?”\nWhen Ven didn’t answer, Hilo said, with a thoughtful but menacing sympathy, “I think you’re losing\nyour nerve. The war in Oortoko has been bad for the world, but good for the national economy. With\nso many foreigners needing to move things around Kekon, business is going well for K-Star Freight,\nso you have other things on your mind. The public and your shareholders have grown to like this\nsupposed peace between the clans. So now you’re less sure of risking your own life. Maybe you think\nthat it wouldn’t be so bad to leave things as they are, to forget that we ever talked.”\nVen moved away from Hilo and went to stand at the boat’s railing. “I haven’t forgotten anything\nwe discussed,” he said shortly, though he sounded less sure of himself now. “But I need the backing\nof the clan to make a move. The Koben family has their supporters, including the Tems and the Gams.\nThe Iwe family has its own allies. After Koben Ento was murdered”—Ven gave Hilo a deeply\nsuspicious look—“there were people out for blood on both sides. Ayt held an urgent, private meeting\nwith the leaders of the Koben family and somehow quieted down the crisis, but with all this tension,\nit’s difficult to gather support for a third option. And with Guim taking over from Son as chancellor of\nthe Royal Council, even Ayt’s detractors within the Mountain don’t want to show internal dissent\nright now.”\n“Spoken like a politician instead of a Green Bone.” Hilo replied with rough contempt. “I didn’t"

And if Ayt had had the full support of her clan,\nshe wouldn’t have had to kill her father’s Horn and her own brother. If you want to lead, you can’t\nwait for everyone to line up behind you.” The Pillar stalked over to stand at the railing beside Ven.\n“It’s possible that I didn’t make myself completely clear the first time around. I offered you the\nsupport and friendship of No Peak because we shared a desire to see Ayt Mada out of power and in\nthe ground. If that’s no longer the case, if our wishes are no longer aligned, then there’s no reason for\nus to talk further.” Hilo tilted his head in a musing way, his voice softening ominously. “If there’s no\none I can count on to challenge Ayt, then I might as well resign myself to turning over a new leaf with\nmy old enemy and informing her of the traitors in her clan.”\nVen’s face went still. “You would place a death sentence on my family?”\n“Your family’s fate is up to you, not me,” Hilo said. “Maybe if you cut off your ear and throw\nyourself at Ayt’s feet, she’ll spare your children, but I think it’s safe to assume that your sailing days\nwould be over. You picked a path that you can’t turn away from. You have to follow it all the way\nnow, or I’ll push you off.” Hilo set the glass he’d taken from the minibar down on the ledge of the\nboat’s railing and leaned in close to Ven, whose shoulders stiffened as the Pillar spoke near his ear.\n“My patience is running out. By this time next year, Ayt Mada had better be feeding the worms. Or\nyou’ll answer to us both.”\nHilo put a hand on the railing and vaulted Lightly over it, landing on the dock and walking back\nalong the pier to where Maik Tar waited for him next to the Duchesse.\nCHAPTER\n51\nThe Unlucky Ones\nW\nhen Kaul Maik Wen went through Espenian customs and immigration, she put her folded jacket\nand the locked steel briefcase she carried through the X-ray machine and walked through the metal\ndetector. A security guard at Port Massy International Airport took her briefcase from the other end of\nthe conveyor and asked her to come with him. The guard led Wen into a secondary screening area—a\ngray room with a couple of chairs against the wall, a metal table, and the flag of the Republic of\nEspenia hanging on the wall. Another guard joined them. They asked Wen for her passport, which\nthey examined. “You’re coming from Kekon?” one asked. She nodded. “Ma’am, please open the\nbriefcase.”\nWen turned the combination on the suitcase lock and pushed open the hinges to pop the latches.\nShe opened the briefcase to reveal a crushed velvet-lined interior filled with polished green\ngemstones, some of them loose, others as jewelry—strung necklaces, bracelets, heavy rings set in\ngold.

The lustrous green gleamed yellowish under the airport room’s fluorescent lights. One of the\ncustoms officers took a slight step backward; the other a slight step forward. “Is this—” the one with\nthe gloves began to ask, but Wen interrupted him. “No, no, of course not,” she assured the guards\nquickly. She laughed, as if embarrassed to have startled them. “It looks like jade, no? It’s just\nnephrite. Very pretty, though, isn’t it?” She took one of the specimens out of the case—a nephrite\nnecklace—and held it out to one of the guards. He hesitated, but she smiled reassuringly and said,\n“I’m a gemstone dealer. Nephrite is our fastest-growing business. These days everyone knows about\njade, and it’s all the rage to look as fierce as a Kekonese Green Bone. In Shotar, they call it ‘barukan\nstyle’ but in Espenia, it’s ‘military chic.’ See?” She loosened the scarf around her neck to show off the\nthree-tier choker she wore on her neck and touched the bracelets at her wrists. “I’m traveling to Port\nMassy, to meet with buyers.”\nThe guard took the necklace and examined it. “I really did think it was bioenergetic jade at first,”\nhe admitted. He passed it to the other guard. “Can you tell the difference?”\nWen could tell from the expressions on their faces that they could not. With a loupe and a trained\neye, a person could see the difference between the grain structures of nephrite and true jade. Of\ncourse, contact with the latter would provoke a physiological reaction, but even without touching the\njewelry, any Green Bone would be able to tell at a glance that the gemstones in the briefcase were\nindeed, nothing but bluffer’s jade—they were not as hard or lustrous, and the hue was different,\nmilkier and duller than real jade. These customs officials, however, were Espenians who had not\ngrown up around the real substance. They could not tell that the gems in the briefcase were different\nfrom the gems she wore around her neck and wrists—real jade, worth countless times more than the\npile of inert stones—and though they picked up and examined several of the items in the case, they\ndidn’t look closely at her choker and bracelets. Wen was counting on misdirection and ignorance—\nthe guards’ natural inclination was to pay attention to the large suitcase of gemstones, not to the few\nworn on her person. Some larger airports, including Port Massy International, had dogs trained to\ndetect jade auras, but Wen had walked past with no trouble. Non-Abukei stone-eyes were rare enough\nthat the Espenians did not account for them in their security measures. Even so, precautions had been\ntaken: The jade that Wen wore had been treated with a slightly opaque coating to dull the color and\nshine and make it appear like bluffer’s jade even to the experienced eye. It could later be cleaned off\nwith nail polish remover.\nThe guard said, “Do you have paperwork?” Wen did; she handed them several pieces of paper on\nthe letterhead of a jewelry company called Divinity Gems based in Janloon, with a listing of the"

She gave them her business card. One of the guards took a\nfew of the stones and the paperwork and left the room. The other guard said, “Thanks for your\npatience. We have to make sure everything checks out, you understand. I thought it was real jade\nmyself.”\nWen chuckled. “If it was, I’d have to be the world’s most powerful Green Bone, and I’d be\ntraveling with a dozen bodyguards to guard a case worth millions of thalirs. My samples are worth\nquite a bit, but not nearly that much. I completely understand the need to check, though. Jade\nsmuggling is a real problem, I’m told.” She sat down in one of the chairs to wait. She knew they were\nexamining the grain structure of the samples under magnification and likely phoning Divinity Gems\nto ascertain that she was, indeed, an employee. The call would go to an undisclosed phone line in the\nWeather Man’s office. The person who answered the call would assure the customs officials that Wen\nwas, indeed, a senior sales director who’d been with the company for four years.\nWen and Shae had discussed and discarded half a dozen different options for covertly\ntransporting cut jade into Espenia—all of them required a combination of shipping the gems through\nmeans subject to inspection or theft, or passing them through other hands: agents who might be\nunreliable, who might betray them or who could not handle jade without being detected. Having been\nprivy to Kehn’s relentless campaign against Zapunyo’s operations, they knew all too well the tricks of\nsmuggling, but also the many ways they could fail. At last, Wen had declared impatiently, “This is\nfoolish, Shae-jen. I’m a stone-eye. Sometimes the most obvious and direct answer is the best one.”\nThe Weather Man had balked awhile longer, but Wen knew her sister-in-law couldn’t argue with\nlogic.\nThe customs inspector returned twenty minutes later and handed Wen her passport, paperwork,\nand samples. “You’re free to go, miss.”\nWen took two nephrite rings from the case and pressed them upon the men. “Take them,” she\nurged. “They’re samples, I have plenty.” One of the guards started to reach for the ring but the other\nshook his head and said, “We’re not allowed to do that, miss.” Wen looked disappointed and said,\n“Have a keychain then,” and she gave them each a nephrite keychain with Divinity Gems etched on\nthe side. Tucking her scarf once more around her neck, she picked up her case and followed the guard\nas he led her back out of the room and let her through the customs gate.\nAnden was waiting for her at the baggage claim area along with a lean man in a black cap and gloves\nthat Anden introduced as Rohn Toro. Wen was pleased to see Anden. For a while, she’d found it hard\nto think kindly of him.

She would always be grateful for the part he’d played in killing Gont Asch and\nsaving the clan as well as her husband’s life, but then he’d turned his back on the family and left—\njust like Shae once had. Hilo had been heartbroken about it; he never brought up the subject, but Wen\ncould see that he still blamed himself, no matter what she said to gently remind him that he’d only\never done what was necessary.\nNow, though, she was glad to see the young man. He’d become an anchor for No Peak in\nEspenia and was proving himself useful here. So Wen greeted him warmly and said, “You look well,\nlittle brother.” Anden smiled the same small, reserved smile he’d always had and asked how her flight\nhad been. She assured him that it had been fine.\nThey drove to a hotel and Wen checked into a suite. Rohn left, saying he would be back in\naround an hour. Anden stayed with Wen in the hotel room, waiting in the separate sitting area while\nshe refreshed herself and changed. This was Wen’s second trip to Espenia—the first, taken two\nmonths ago carrying a suitcase of nephrite but no real jade, had been a test run, to establish a travel\nhistory for her role as a sales representative of Divinity Gems and to familiarize herself with what to\nexpect when going through customs. So she was still taken aback by how cold it was in Port Massy\nand was glad she’d packed sweaters and scarves. She went back out into the sitting room and pulled\nback the heavy drapes enough to peer outside. Port Massy, smoky and gray in winter twilight,\nsprawled below. She was charmed by it, by the majestic foreignness of the place, even by how much\nsmaller the Mast Building looked in real life than it did on the postcards. She was looking forward to\nexploring the city and seeing some of the famous sights.\nAnden muted the television show he’d been watching and asked if she needed anything. Wen\nshook her head and sat down beside him, smoothing her skirt over her knees. “Anden,” she said,\nputting a hand on his arm, “Hilo knows I’m here in Port Massy, working for the Weather Man on\nforeign real estate projects, but he doesn’t know the other part. You must never mention to him that I\nwas the one who carried the jade into the country.”\nAnden glanced at her, then down at his hands, clearly uncomfortable with being asked to keep a\nsecret. Wen said, “He wouldn’t approve. You know how he feels about certain things. With Hilo,\nyou’re either a Green Bone or you’re not.”\n“I know,” Anden said. “He doesn’t want me back in Janloon so long as I’m not green.”\n“That’s not true,” Wen said. “We all miss you at home. But your cousins have their reasons. Shae\nthinks it’ll be good for you to have an Espenian education, to speak a second language and have\nexperience living abroad. You’ll be able to put those advantages to use for the clan even if you don’t\nwear green. Isn’t that worth the hardship of being away from home for a little while, now, while\nyou’re young?

Hilo… well.” Wen smiled, her expression a little resigned. “Anyone without jade is\nsomewhat like a child to him, to be kept away from the realities and dangers we’re not a part of. Even\nme. I know he loves me and values my opinions, but I’m not in his world, not completely. If he seems\ndistant or unforgiving toward you, it’s because he doesn’t know where you fit now, how to treat you\nwhen you return.”\nAnden turned to her with a searching gaze, serious but hopeful. Wen thought that even though\nAnden was not a Kaul by blood, in that moment, he looked more like Lan than either Hilo or Shae\never did. “Will you talk to him, for me?” he asked. “And to Shae-jen? Of course, I’ll keep your secret\nno matter what,” he added quickly, “but I know they listen to you.”\n“I will,” Wen promised, touched by his earnestness. She looped an arm around one of his. “It’s\nnot so bad living here in Port Massy, is it? Shae tells me that you have a foster family here, there’s an\nentire Kekonese neighborhood, and even relayball. You’ve been here for almost three years; do you\nfeel as if you have friends here now, things that make you happy, people who you care about?”\nAnden said, “Yes. You’re right, it’s not so bad. Pretty good, actually. I’m done with classes, and\nI’m… seeing someone.” He flushed and seemed almost surprised at himself for the admission, but\nWen only smiled; they were the two unlucky members of the family, each in their own way—who\nbetter to confide such things, if not to each other? “I would never have guessed I’d find someone in\nEspenia, and he’s very Espenian in a lot of ways. We don’t see each other as much as we used to,\nthough.” Anden’s voice took a slightly troubled turn. “It’s not that I’m unhappy in Espenia. But I\ndon’t think I could ever really feel at home here. And it’s hard being so far away from everything\nthat’s happening in the family.” He turned to her and said, “When I heard about what happened to\nKehn, I felt as if I should’ve been there. Even though I know there was nothing I could’ve done, no\nway that I could’ve helped, and I wasn’t even close enough to the Horn to know him very well, but…\nI still feel as if I should’ve been there.”\nWen smiled sadly and rubbed at her eyes. “I have every reason to stay at home. Hilo would\nprefer it, and the children are little. You should see Lina’s new baby—he looks so much like Kehn. I\nmiss them all very much when I’m gone. But I feel as if I should be out here, doing something more.\nSo it’s true that you can be happy but still not satisfied.”\nThere was a knock on the door.

Anden got up to peer through the peephole, then opened the door\nto admit Rohn Toro and four other men who entered quickly and closed the door behind them. It was\nsuddenly crowded in the room; Wen was thankful for Anden’s familiar presence among the strange\nmen. All of the visitors were Green Bones who spoke to each other and to Anden in Espenian, but\nthey greeted Wen in Kekonese, saluting her respectfully and saying they were honored to meet her.\nThere were only two chairs at the hotel room table; Wen and Anden sat down and the five Green\nBones stood around. Wen laid out the jade choker, bracelets, and three other coils of jade beads that\nshe’d smuggled in under her clothes. After arriving at the hotel, she’d soaked them in solvent in the\nbathroom sink, wiped them clean of their coating, and laid them out to dry. Now they gleamed like\nnothing else on earth—unmistakable as true Kekonese jade.\nWith everyone watching, she used a pair of wire clippers and carefully separated the jade pieces,\npiling them next to each other on a black cloth in the center of the table. When she was done, there\nwere two hundred equally sized jade beads on the table—nearly as much jade as what one might\nexpect on half a class of Kaul Du Academy graduates. A veritable fortune. A reverential hush fell over\nall the men in the room. None of them touched the jade—so much of it in one place would be unwise\nfor anyone to handle. Anyone but a stone-eye.\nRohn reached into a satchel he had brought with him and took out five small lead-lined boxes\nwith hinged covers. Wen counted out an equal number of stones into each box. She closed the boxes\nand each Green Bone in attendance took one. They were, Wen had been told, well trusted by the Pillar\nin this city: Rohn and two of his captains from Port Massy, one man from Adamont Capita, and\nanother who’d come all the way from the city of Resville. The exchange complete, they saluted her\nbefore they exited. “May the gods shine favor on No Peak,” said the younger of Rohn’s protégés, in\naccented but fluent Kekonese. In one day, the No Peak clan had supplied the Kekonese-Espenian\ncommunity with as much jade as an Espenian military platoon. These leaders would grant the jade in\ntheir possession to worthy subordinates; they had all agreed to take full responsibility for the Green\nBones they trained and equipped, with the understanding that prudence and discretion were of the\nutmost importance if they were to exert their substantial new advantage over the Crews while staying\nbeneath the notice of law enforcement.\nLastly, Wen brought out the steel suitcase full of bluffer’s jade and handed it without ceremony\nto Rohn. There was no such company as Divinity Gems, but there was a recently formed Espenian\nfirm called Kekon Imports, run by a Kekonese-Espenian businessman bankrolled in part by the\nrecently formed Weather Man’s branch office in Port Massy. Rohn would hand the case of green\ngemstones over to Kekon Imports, which would indeed sell them to Espenian jewelry stores. Rohn\nexchanged a few cordial words with Anden, then left."

She\nrelaxed on the sofa and massaged the balls of her feet. Anden remained sitting where he was, but he\ntoo looked immensely relieved. It was no small thing to have surreptitiously moved that much jade\nacross the Amaric Ocean and passed it into the intended hands.\n“Would you like to get something to eat?” Anden asked her.\nWen got up, stifling a yawn and suspecting that she had about an hour left before the jet lag set\nin. “That would be lovely. Take me wherever you think we should go; I’m trusting you to introduce\nme to good Espenian food. After that, I think I’d better get to sleep early.” She did have to be at the\nWeather Man’s branch office the next morning; her official job as a design consultant on clan\nproperties was no ruse—there would be floor plans to review tomorrow.\nCHAPTER\n52\nThis Is Serious\nT\nhe Weather Man’s branch office in Espenia was located on Garden Street in Port Massy, not\nexactly in the central financial area, but close enough to still be considered the heart of downtown.\nAnden rode the subway to and from work every day; it took only fifteen minutes door to door. The\nrent on his studio apartment was too expensive for what he got, but it was one of the nicer buildings\nin Southtrap and only a block away from the transit station, so he had to endure less time outdoors\nduring the coldest months of winter.\nMr. and Mrs. Hian had assured him that he was welcome to continue boarding with them after he\ngraduated. “Anden-se, you’re no trouble at all,” they insisted. “You’re the best guest we’ve ever had,\nyou’re practically like a third son to us by now, and so helpful around here.”\nAnden was tempted; he was truly fond of the elderly couple. With them, he felt as if he had a\nhome in Port Massy. He’d become accustomed to Mrs. Hian’s cooking and his personal space in the\nguest bedroom. (The noise behind the building had ceased to disturb his sleep long ago.) But, as he\nexplained to his hosts regretfully, now that he would be working downtown and no longer going to\nPort Massy College, it made sense to move to a more convenient location. Also, though he didn’t\nmention this, the Dauks had fixed up and sold Cory’s old condo unit, and now that Anden would be\nearning a living, he felt he should have a place of his own where Cory could come and spend the\nnight whenever he was in Port Massy. Anden promised the Hians that he would still visit them often,\nwhich he did, more often it seemed than their own sons, bringing them groceries and helping to\nshovel the sidewalk during winter. He still saw some of his old relayball friends, but less often. Derek\nhad a new job, Sammy was training regularly under Rohn Toro, Tod was gone on an eight-month-\nlong military deployment.\nNo Peak had established operations in a professional office building that housed a couple of\nsmall law firms and accounting practices, an ad agency, a college test prep center, and the"

The name on the directory in the lobby and on the\nfront door of the Weather Man’s branch office read, in both Espenian and Kekonese, KEKON TRADE\nPARTNERSHIP LIAISON OFFICE. There were a total of twelve people who worked in the office, which was\nfour more than there had been on the first day that Anden had arrived for work six months ago.\nAnden’s official title was junior associate, which initially gave him no clue as to what his actual job\nwould be, but he deduced that it was equivalent to perhaps an entry-level fourth- or fifth-rank\nLuckbringer. This was ironic and amusing to Anden; considering his grades in math during his years\nat Kaul Du Academy, he would never have imagined that he would one day find himself on the\nbusiness side of the clan.\nFortunately, he was not expected to do much desk work. His boss, Hami Tumashon, had most\nrecently been the Master Luckbringer of No Peak, reporting directly to Kaul Shaelinsan. Hami knew\nexactly who Anden was. “Kaul Shae-jen gave me the freedom to choose my own team, except she\ntold me that I had to take you.” Hami had a straightforward manner, and when he spoke, Anden could\nhear the Janloon accent, which he had never noticed in himself but that he now realized was distinctly\ndifferent from the way Keko-Espenians such as Cory talked. Hami studied Anden and said, gruffly\nbut without rancor, “So I’m to have a Kaul watching over my shoulder and reporting back to Janloon\nto make sure I’m not wasting the clan’s time and money out here.”\nAnden said, “Mr. Hami, I just graduated from the city college and my cousins are trying to find\nsomething for me to do, that’s all. I’m supposed to help you in any way I can, but if I’m not of any\nuse to you, just tell me so.” He was well aware that he had few qualifications.\nOne of the first tasks that Hami gave him was to recruit new staff members. “We need some\nlocals,” he explained. “Bilingual Espenian-born or Espenian-naturalized people who know the\nmarket, the culture, the way business is done around here. If you have friends in the Kekonese\ncommunity here in Port Massy, start there and see if you can get some leads.”\nAnden paid a visit to Dauk Losunyin and explained the situation. Dauk nodded thoughtfully.\n“Anything I can do to help your family’s business, I will,” he said. The Pillar of Southtrap was in\ngood spirits these days; his youngest daughter had given birth to a baby girl—his third grandchild—\nand the police were no longer monitoring him as they were too busy dealing with the violent conflict\nthat had broken out between the three major Crews.\nAccording to what Anden had heard from Rohn Toro, Boss Kromner had become fearful of\nSkinny Reams’s growing status and suspected him of skimming from the new jade business.

He’d\nsent another of his foremen, Moth Duke, to have Reams killed, but Reams escaped and allied with\nAnga Slatter, who knew that Kromner’s Southside Crew was sure to come after the Wormingwood\nCrew sooner or later and saw this as an opportunity to act preemptively. Reams and Slatter gained the\ntacit cooperation of the Baker Street Crew, and shortly thereafter, the bodies of Moth Duke and two of\nhis men were found in a boathouse, strangled and suffocated with white plastic bags tied over their\nheads. A signature Crew-style execution, meant to serve as an explicit warning to others. Kromner\nwent into hiding south of the city.\nAll through the spring and summer, the highly publicized Crew battles and dramatic fall of Port\nMassy’s celebrity crime boss were splashed across the headlines of the city’s newspapers. Jade—\nmade popular on the black market by the ongoing international attention around the Oortokon War—\nwas blamed for the violence. Four members of the Wormingwood Crew were killed in broad daylight\nby two assassins reportedly moving faster than any normal human being. There were a combined\neight hospitalizations for jade poisoning and SN1 overdose. The Port Massy Police Department,\nfacing public allegations of corruption and ineptitude, cracked down on the Crews. A jade-polishing\nwarehouse on the Camres River was uncovered and shut down, the drugged migrants deported.\nWith the Crews at each other’s throats and the police beleaguered, there was little trouble in\nSouthtrap for the Kekonese community. While repairs were going on at the damaged community\ncenter, the grudge hall was quietly relocated to a converted warehouse owned by Derek’s uncle.\nWhen the original space was reopened, demand was such that the new location also stayed open, so\nthere was now additional space for Green Bones to train by day, and high attendance and gambling\nmoney flowing freely by night. A week after the news broke that Boss Kromner had been tracked\ndown and apprehended by the police on trumped-up charges of labor exploitation, Anden received a\ncall from Dauk Losun, for no particular reason other than to inquire as to how he was doing these\ndays in his new apartment and at his new job.\n“My friend,” Dauk said, “if there is anything you or your family ever need, please do not hesitate\nto ask. May the gods shine favor on No Peak, as they say in the old country.”\nA couple of weeks after Anden’s request for assistance, Dauk Sana arrived at the Kekon Trade\nPartnership Liaison Office with a list of two dozen names. Anden introduced her to Hami and the two\nof them spent some time talking about which part of Kekon their respective families were from before\nSana got down to business. “Mrs. Kuni is one of my longtime clients, because of her stomach\ntroubles. Right now, her son works in the mortgage industry but he doesn’t like it very much; he\nwould be interested in a new job. He was always good in school. His Kekonese is so-so.” Dauk Sana"

Apparently, Anden had shown himself to be of some use, so he was next\nassigned to learn everything he could about the liquor market, which included reading trade\npublications, going around to liquor stores, restaurants, and bars to interview proprietors, and\npurchasing samples of hundreds of different types of alcoholic beverages and having them packed up\nand shipped to Janloon for product comparison tests. No Peak thought there might be a market for\nKekonese hoji in Espenia. After that, he was sent to scout commercial real estate.\nAnden was surprised, as the autumn days cooled and Harvest’Eves decorations went up again, to\nfind himself enjoying his job. His coworkers were mostly Kekonese, so he felt at ease among them,\nbut his tasks were such that there was plenty of need to interact with outsiders, and to speak, read, and\nwrite Espenian. His duties were varied and consisted of whatever Hami needed done, so he was rarely\nbored, and he learned a great deal about how a small part of the Weather Man’s office was run, as\nwell as different sectors of the Espenian economy.\nOn occasion, he was given an assignment that Hami quietly told him came “from the greener\nside of the clan,” which meant it was a matter of importance to the Horn, or perhaps the Pillar\nhimself. He was told to examine phone books and government records and make some discreet calls\nto determine the whereabouts of two former military servicemen, recently released on parole after\nserving a year in prison for abducting and raping a Kekonese girl while stationed on Euman Island.\nAnden made a couple of trips—one to the south Port Massy suburb of Orslow, the other five hours\naway to the town of Evenfield—to make certain his information was correct, as he knew the men\nwere to be punished, possibly with death. After he reported his findings, he received an unexpected\nlong-distance phone call from Maik Tar, asking for clarification on a few of the details and thanking\nhim for being so thorough.\nSeveral weeks later, Anden learned that one of the offenders had been ambushed and beaten in\nan apparent robbery attempt that left him paralyzed from the waist down, and the other suffered\nextensive third-degree burns from the fire that destroyed his house. Anden suspected that he was the\nonly junior associate under Hami’s supervision who was trusted with matters such as these, and he\ntook that as a hopeful sign. When he’d first arrived in Port Massy nearly three years ago, he’d viewed\nhis situation in the bleakest of terms, as a jadeless, damaged exile salvaging what few options\nremained to him. Only now did it seem to Anden that perhaps there was a path forward, resolving out\nof the fog."

Only now did it seem to Anden that perhaps there was a path forward, resolving out\nof the fog.\nAnden watched Cory standing shirtless in front of the mirror, shaving. He was humming a song,\nsomething Anden didn’t know. It was a Seventhday morning in the dead of winter and there was not\nyet even a hint of morning light outside the windows of Anden’s apartment, but Cory had to take the\nearly bus back to campus because he had study hall that evening. He was in his second year of law\nschool now, and busier than ever. Sometimes he would come back to Port Massy for family events\nbut not have time to see Anden at all, so at other times, he would come into town unannounced for a\nday or two just so they could spend time together. “Don’t come to the bus station to meet me,” Cory\nhad instructed him over the phone. “My parents don’t know I’m coming and it’s going to be a world\nof trouble to explain it if someone sees us. I’ll take a cab to your place.”\nAnden would clear his schedule; they would have sex, watch television, talk, have sex again.\nWhen they wanted to go out to restaurants, the movie theater, or the arcade, they took the subway out\nof Southtrap to other parts of the city—Lochwood, Quince, Athwart—where they weren’t likely to\nrun into anyone they knew. At first, Cory visited every month, but over time the intervals stretched to\nsix weeks, then eight. Watching Cory now, it occurred to Anden that they had not discussed when he\nwould next visit; neither of them had brought it up.\n“Who else are you sleeping with?” Anden asked.\nCory looked at him in surprise, comically frozen with shaving cream on one half of his face.\n“Where did that come from?” he asked, hurt and indignant. “No one else. Not seriously.”\n“What does seriously mean? Is this serious? What we have going on?” Anden had never pegged\nhimself as the possessive type and was surprised to hear himself speaking so fiercely.\nCory finished shaving, wiped his face off with a towel, and came back to Anden’s bed. He\nsprawled on the bedspread. The trio of jade studs around his navel stood out against his pale skin.\n“Look, law school is really stressful because we’re working all the time, so when we do let loose,\nthere are some wild parties. I’ve been drunk—everyone’s been drunk—at a few of them, and ended\nup making out with a few people. And there was a one-night stand, only one, last semester, that was\nreally stupid in hindsight. But that’s it, I promise. I’m not seeing anyone else.”\nAt Anden’s silence, Cory reached out and tapped him on the chin, giving him an entreating look.\n“I’m with you, crumb. You’re more real. I mean, you’re younger than me, but there’s something\nabout you that makes you seem older. You take life more seriously. Me”—he shrugged—“I try to take\nthings one step at a time, you know? To live for today. I don’t know for certain what I want to do after\nlaw school, but I’m keeping an open mind about it.” He leaned over and kissed Anden on his bare"

He was hesitant to begin the conversation but vexed by the fact that they\nhad never even broached the subject. “Would you ever… want to live in Kekon? If I get the chance to\nmove back to Janloon, I’d want to know if that was… something you’d consider.”\nCory propped himself up on his elbows and looked at Anden intently, eyebrows raised. “Is this\nhypothetical or is it actually going to happen? Has your family asked you to go back?”\n“It’s hypothetical,” Anden mumbled. “I just thought we should talk about it.”\n“Well, hypothetically…” Cory rolled onto his back and crossed his hands behind his head,\ngazing up at Anden’s ceiling. “Yeah sure, I wouldn’t mind spending some time overseas. Seeing\nwhere my parents are from, getting in touch with my ancestral roots, that sort of thing. I’ve never\nlived in another country. It could be a toppers life experience.” His eyes danced with optimism at the\nidea. “Of course, it would depend on timing and circumstances, but anything’s possible, crumb.”\n“What would your parents think?”\nCory rolled his eyes back in exasperation. “Why do you always ask that? You’d think they were\nyour parents, the way you worry.” He sat up and blew out a heavy breath that ruffled the hair over his\nbrow. “Look, I’ve been a good kid to my folks. I’ve done what they wanted: I wear jade, I help out in\nthe community, I’m going to law school. My ma will always want to keep me close because I’m the\nbaby boy, and my da expects me to be ‘successful’—which for him, is a very specific combination of\nbeing an old-school Green Bone and a wealthy lawyer.” Cory laughed, but there was an edge of\nfrustration to the laughter. He sobered and looked straight into Anden’s eyes. “I want to do right by\nmy folks, but I’m old enough to make my own life decisions, crumb. If moving to Kekon is important\nto you—to us—then we should seriously consider it.” Cory leaned over and gave Anden a quick,\nsunny kiss, then swung his legs off the bed and stood up, stretching his long, lean body. He glanced\nover his shoulder at Anden as he picked up his clothes. “You’ve gone quiet on me again. Hey, it’s not\nlike there’s some big rush to decide, right? We can talk about it more another time. It’s just a matter of\nfiguring out what we really want.”\nAnden thought about the conversation later and still felt dissatisfied. He wished he had been\nmore honest and assertive in that moment, told Cory that he already knew he wanted to return to\nKekon, and when the time came, he hoped Cory would come with him.\nThen he remembered what Hilo had said about Cory Dauk in their last conversation, and his\ndoubts rose. He couldn’t make it as a Green Bone in Janloon, you know that. Was his cousin right?\nCould Cory be happy in Janloon? Their positions would be reversed; Cory would be the foreigner. If"

If\nhe wore his jade there, he wouldn’t be protected by aisho—would it be too dangerous for him? Even\nthough he was aware of and involved in his father’s dealings, he had no real understanding of the way\nthe clans worked in Kekon. And if the Dauks did not want their son to leave, might that not create bad\nfeelings between the families, when they were now allies and Anden’s cousins were relying on the\ngood relationship with the Dauks to accomplish the things they wanted to in Espenia?\nAll of these worries were currently without purpose, Anden told himself. After all, he had no\ndefinite timeline, no real impetus to force the issue. Better to live a day at a time, as Cory said.\nEarly one morning on a Sixthday shortly after the Kekonese New Year, Anden received a phone call\nat his apartment. He’d gotten out of bed only fifteen minutes ago and was standing in the bathroom\nwith his feet on the heater vent as he brushed his teeth, his reflection visible in the small fogged\nwindow that showed nothing but frosted darkness. The small television he’d turned on in the main\nroom was recapping the week’s news: mounting public and political pressure on Premier Galtz and\nthe National Assembly to order a withdrawal from Oortoko, rising interest rates, the latest gossip\nabout some movie starlet.\nAt first Anden thought the ringing he heard was coming from the television; then he realized the\ncall must be from Janloon because who else would phone at this time? It would be early evening back\nhome. When he shut off the television and picked up the phone, he said, “Hello?” in Kekonese; still,\nhe was surprised to hear Hilo’s voice, muted by the long-distance connection. “We need to talk to\nyou, Andy,” said the Pillar. “Shae and Juen are here in the room too. I’m putting you on speaker.”\nSince he’d moved to Espenia, Anden could count on one hand the number of times he’d spoken\nto Hilo on the phone. “He doesn’t like talking on the phone,” Shae had said to Anden once,\napologetically. Anden suspected that more accurately, Hilo did not like to talk to him on the phone, to\nbe reminded of his disgraced younger cousin being so far away. And Anden had certainly never been\non a conference call with the Pillar, the Weather Man, and the Horn of No Peak all in attendance.\nWorried now, Anden said, “Is there something wrong?”\nShae’s voice came from a distance on the other end. “Nothing’s wrong, Anden.”\n“We need your help, cousin,” Hilo said, “to get something done in Espenia.”\nAnden turned on a lamp and sat down on his bed. “What do you need help with?”\nThe Pillar said, “Killing a man.”\nCHAPTER\n53\nSins and Compromises\nZ\napunyo’s diabetic condition had after many years finally caught up with him and he was in need of\na kidney transplant.

The medical care in the Uwiwa Islands being one of the worst in the world, and\nmoney not being an issue for the wealthy smuggler, Zapunyo arranged to travel to Espenia in six\nmonths’ time and pay a premium to have the surgery performed at a private hospital in Port Massy.\nThis rare instance in which he would be leaving his fortified compound in Tialuhiya was discovered\nby a well-placed No Peak spy in the Uwiwas and was the opportunity that Hilo and Shae had been\nsearching for since last summer.\nAnden went to see Dauk Losunyin to ask for what he wanted. “Dauk-jen,” he said, “this\nsmuggler, Zapunyo, he rarely ever leaves his fortress in the Uwiwa Islands. He has an entire operation\nemploying barukan, rockfish, and cheap labor to scavenge jade from the mines, take it out of Kekon,\nand ship it to black market buyers in Ygutan and Oortoko, and to dangerous organizations like the\nCrews.”\nDauk nodded in understanding but said, “Boss Kromner is awaiting trial and may spend decades\nin prison. The other Bosses are in hiding. Why do I need to think of this Zapunyo?”\n“Even if Kromner goes to jail, there’ll be others who take his place. As long as jade remains\nillegal and coveted, there’ll be criminals in this country and all over the world who’ll try to get their\nhands on it, and Zapunyo will sell it to them. Maybe the newspapers are right and Kromner’s fall\nmeans that the heyday of the Crews in Port Massy is at an end, but maybe not, or perhaps other\ngroups will rise up and pose an even greater threat to us. The solution is to cut off the black market at\nthe source, and that means stopping the smuggling of jade out of Kekon.”\nThey were sitting together in Dauk’s living room, the Pillar in an armchair, Anden on the sofa\nacross from him. Sana had recently finished up with a client who’d come for a healing session, and\nnow she was walking around behind her husband, their baby granddaughter asleep in her arms.\nDauk looked at Anden with a trace of disappointment. “Anden, you and your family are well\nknown to us by now; why not just say exactly what you want and why?”\nAnden dropped his gaze to the cup of tea in his hand, then put it down on the coffee table. He\nspoke carefully. “The first time I met you, I told you that I was only a student, that despite my\nupbringing, I couldn’t speak for my cousins in Janloon. Now, I can tell you in all honesty that in\ncoming to you today, I’m speaking on behalf of the No Peak clan.” Anden held Dauk’s gaze this time.\n“This man, Zapunyo, tried to kill the Pillar and is responsible for the death of the Horn. If my sister-\nin-law and her children had been in the car at the time, they would be dead as well. He’s an enemy of\nmy family who, because of his distance and resources, has gone unpunished for his actions. While\nhe’s here in Espenia, we have to kill him.”"

While\nhe’s here in Espenia, we have to kill him.”\nDauk blew a long breath from his nose. “You say this man is well guarded, that even the Green\nBone warriors in the No Peak clan can’t get to him. So how do you propose to do so?”\n“It won’t be easy,” Anden admitted. “My cousins have an idea, a way to get past his barukan\nguards, but we need your permission and your help, Dauk-jen. We need Rohn Toro.”\nDauk Losun turned to his wife. “Let me speak to our friend alone for a while.”\nAnden was surprised; never in all the time he’d known the Dauks had the Pillar asked his wife to\nleave. Even more surprisingly, Dauk Sana pressed her lips together with a look of understanding. She\nput the baby in the stroller. “I’ll go for a walk and pick up a few things at the store,” she said. She\nopened the door and left the house, leaving Anden and her husband alone.\nDauk Losun refilled their teacups. He leaned back in the armchair and said, “Since the first time\nthe Hians brought you to my house, I’ve only come to think more highly of you. I could see right\naway that you’re the sort of young man who would be respected in the old country, someone who\nmeans every word that he says. In truth, I wish my own son were more like you—but he is who he is.\nI have the greatest respect for you and your family. So when you said you were coming here, I was\nprepared to give you whatever you asked for, because I value the friendship of the No Peak clan\nnearly as much as my own jade.” Dauk’s normally open, amiable face turned somber. “However, after\nhaving heard what you’re asking for, I can’t agree to help you.\n“It’s one thing to wear jade for one’s own protection and to defend one’s friends and neighbors.\nThat is what Green Bones have always done; no law made by man can change that. We hold fast to\nour traditions, which others don’t understand, and we’re not harming anyone in doing so. And it’s\nalso true that sometimes we must punish people who hurt our community and criminals who are a\nthreat to us. We only want what everyone in this country wants: to have a good life and a better future\nfor our children.” Dauk paused and rubbed a hand over the back of his neck. “This Zapunyo is a\nstranger to me. He may be a bad man, but he’s done nothing to harm our community directly. We may\nfeel the ripples of the struggle over jade smuggled from Kekon to the Uwiwa Islands, but it’s an\nocean away. It’s not our struggle. You’re asking me to murder a man I don’t know here on Espenian\nsoil, to expose my family and my good friend Rohn Toro to unnecessary danger and punishment\nunder Espenian law.”\nAnden was not surprised by Dauk’s response and had warned his cousins that might be the case.\nHe said, “Everything will be planned and arranged by No Peak under assumed names.

Afterward, the clan can get Rohn out of the country—he can hide in\nKekon, or anywhere he likes—a paid vacation, until it’s safe to return.”\n“Did you come to Espenia to escape being a Green Bone? Listen to yourself, Anden. You sound\nlike a Fist.” The older man smiled but shook his head. “I’m sorry. In this, I can’t help you.” When\nAnden sat silent and disappointed, Dauk said, “If this is so important to you, then perhaps you have to\nbe the one to carry it out. Of course, I know you were trained to wear jade.”\nAnden’s jaw tightened. “You’ve never asked me about this before, Dauk-jen, but I’m sure you\nknow: I was sent here to Espenia because I refused to be a Green Bone. It’s been years since I’ve\nworn jade. I don’t know whether I’d be able to control it, or what it would do to me. That makes me\ntoo unpredictable to be useful in this situation. Even if that weren’t the case, I swore to myself that I\nwouldn’t put on jade again. That’s the one thing I can’t compromise.”\nDauk was silent for longer than Anden expected. He seemed to be debating with himself. At last\nhe said, “I understand, and I appreciate you being frank about your past. So let me do the same. It’s\ntime we talked about the one thing I can’t compromise.”\nWhen I arrived in Port Massy with my mother and sisters, I was fourteen years old. One of my sisters,\nthe youngest, died of pneumonia only two years later. My older sister, she ran away with a man that\nmy mother didn’t approve of, and we stopped hearing from her. So after that, it was only my mother\nand me. We lived in an apartment over a public laundry house. What I remember most about that\nplace was the smell of the soap that everyone used back then—Purely’s Rock Soap—and the damp.\nThe windows were always steamed up and the paint on the walls was bubbled and peeling. In winter,\nyou could feel the damp even more, it was terrible.\nAlmost all of us who lived in the neighborhood had fled the old country because our homes had\nbeen destroyed or our relatives imprisoned or executed by the Shotarians. Our parents had been proud\nGreen Bones or Lantern Men in the One Mountain Society, but in Espenia, we had no status. We were\nrefugees with nothing. Everyone looked down on us, even the Tuni immigrants who lived on the other\nside of Beecher Street thought we were lower than them. But we were proud of who we were and\nwhere we had come from, and we kept to the old ways.\nWhen I was in my twenties, I worked as a deliveryman for an appliance store owner named Ito,\nwho I think used to be a good man but had suffered too much and gone a little crazy.

        "text": "When I was in my twenties, I worked as a deliveryman for an appliance store owner named Ito,\nwho I think used to be a good man but had suffered too much and gone a little crazy. Ito was a Green\nBone whose family, like many others, had brought their jade with them to Espenia but did not dare to\nwear it openly on the street. We were outnumbered by foreigners of all sorts and we saw theft\neverywhere around us. Children stole from shop carts, hoodlums stole from homes and businesses,\nthe Crews stole from everybody. All with little consequence. We had come to a land of thieves. So\nanyone who had jade did well to keep it hidden. Although I was born and trained in a Green Bone\nfamily, my father and my uncles had been taken by the Shotarians and their jade taken with them. So\nmy family was poor even by the standards of our neighborhood.\nLike I said, Ito was a good man but had gone a little crazy. One day he got into an argument with\na Shotarian customer. As a child in Kekon, Ito had watched his own sister raped by Shotarian soldiers\nand his older brother beaten until he could no longer walk or talk, so Ito hated Shotarians even more\nthan the rest of us did, almost with a kind of madness. That evening, offensive words were\nexchanged, and then things got out of hand and the Shotarian man ended up dead on the floor of Ito’s\nshop. I was the only one who saw it happen. Ito turned to me with a wild look, and in that instant, I\nsaw that he was thinking that I was the only witness and he would have to kill me too, to make sure\nno one found out what he’d done. Quickly, I reassured Ito that it had not been his fault, that it had\nbeen an accident brought about by the other man’s provocation. Thinking to save my own life, I\noffered to help Ito get rid of the body.\nIt was a horrible thing that we did. We cut that Shotarian’s body into pieces and we paddled a\nrowboat up the Camres, sinking them into different sections of the river, weighed down with cement.\nI had nightmares about it for many years. Sometimes I still do.\nEven after I’d helped Ito with this grisly task, I feared for my life. What had happened unhinged\nthe man even more. Whenever he looked at me, I knew he was trying to Perceive my sense of guilt\nand wondering if I would talk. He was still thinking about killing me. Looking back, I think the stress\nhad gotten to him and he was beginning to suffer from the early stages of the Itches. In Kekon,\nsomeone in the clan might’ve noticed; a caring friend or relative might’ve made him seek medical\nhelp, but he was alone in Port Massy and I was the only one who knew.\nThe police came poking around, asking questions about the Shotarian man’s disappearance. Of\ncourse, no one told them anything because the police are not trustworthy and half of them take money\nfrom the Crews, but rumors began spreading within the neighborhood that Ito had something to do\nwith it.

A Green Bone who loses control\nand goes mad is a danger to everyone, especially in Espenia, where people do not understand jade and\nwhere it would only bring more negative attention from outsiders.\nThere was another Green Bone in the neighborhood, a young man named Rohn Toro, who was\nknown for being a good fighter that even the Crews respected and would hire for some of their jobs.\nRohn had gotten into trouble with the law before, so the police suspected he was responsible for the\nmurder of the Shotarian man. They came to arrest him, but Rohn fled and went into hiding. For\nweeks, he remained in a basement and didn’t emerge. Rohn and I were acquainted and lived in the\nsame building, so I brought him food while he kept out of sight.\nPeople began to grumble about Ito. They could forgive him for killing a Shotarian man and\ncovering up the deed, but it was wrong for him to remain silent and let another Green Bone be\naccused and likely executed in his place. Ito, though, thought only of his own skin. He had a weak\ncharacter and would never have lasted as a Green Bone in Kekon. Ito found out where Rohn was\nconcealed and was about to go to the police with the information. Once Rohn was arrested and\npunished in his place, Ito figured he would be in the clear. All that would be left to do was to get rid\nof me as well.\nWhen I realized what Ito was planning, I went to Rohn Toro and we decided to act. Together, we\nambushed Ito on his way to the police station. There were two of us, and Rohn was younger and\nstronger in jade ability than Ito. We killed Ito and took his jade.\nI had no special skills or standing in the community, except that even then, I was known as\nsomeone who was honest, and I was good at listening and speaking reasonably and convincing people\nto my way of thinking. With Ito dead, I went around to all the neighbors and told them what had to be\ndone to prevent any further trouble. When the police came around searching for Rohn, over a dozen\npeople came forward to say that Ito had been the murderer and had fled the city. Sure enough, the\npolice found the Shotarian man’s wallet and traces of his clothes and blood in Ito’s shop—that was\nhow stupid the man was—but they never found the man himself. The important thing was that they\ndidn’t come after Rohn or anyone else.\nThe true murderer was punished, the neighborhood was spared further police scrutiny, and a\nGreen Bone who could not be trusted was removed from being a danger to us all. The community\nsaw this as my doing, and they began coming to me to deal with other problems, some small and\nsome big, and over time they began to call me the Pillar. But in my heart, I knew that even though the\noutcome was all for the best, the gods knew what I had done.\nI’d been Ito’s accomplice in covering up the murder of an innocent man.

And even though Ito was surely\nplanning to kill me, he was a man who was in pain who had shown me kindness and given me my\nfirst job and livelihood to support my mother and my young wife.

We went to the temple to beg the gods for the favor of a son who would carry the family’s\njade, but it was only after ten years of trying that we finally had Coru. He’s a good son, but he is\nfrivolous. I did my best to raise him as a true Green Bone, but he has a childish heart. He wants only\nto get along with everyone and play around. He’s my only son, the one who will carry the family’s\njade when Sana and I are gone. I love him, but he is also my punishment, for the sins I committed as a\nyoung man.\nDauk stood up from his chair. “I will do what you ask.

I’ve been\nindulgent of him, but he needs to stop fooling around with men and take his responsibilities seriously.\nHe’s the only Green Bone out of all four of my children, as undeserving and ignorant as he might be\nof what it truly means to wear jade and how important it is to our family’s identity. He’s not green\nenough for the old country, but that doesn’t matter; he can still have a good Espenian life, a career\nthat puts that expensive law degree to use, children someday, if the gods are kind to us. He’s not for\nyou. You are sure to return to Janloon eventually, but his place is here.”\nAnden struggled at first to find a response. “That’s Cory’s decision,” he said.\n“I’m not talking to him now. I’m talking to you. It’s as much your choice as it is his. You come\nhere asking me to commit a crime to help your family, so it’s only right that I ask you for something\nin return. Give up my son, and I will bend my principles, to help you and your family in this thing\nthat you want. That’s the only way I’m willing to cross this line for you.”\nAnden looked at Dauk, a man he’d dismissed when he first met him but had grown to respect, a\nleader of his community and a shrewd man, truly a Pillar in his own way and own right, a person that\nAnden now felt deeply indebted to. In that moment, Anden hated him.\nHe stood up. “You called me a man who means every word he says. I don’t want to say anything"

I don’t want to say anything\nI’ll regret, which is why I’m not saying anything to you right now, Dauk-jen.”\nDauk stood up and walked Anden to the door. “You’re wise for your age, my friend.”\nIt was late the following evening by the time Anden mustered up the courage to call Cory at the house\nthat he shared with three other law students. To his surprise, it answered on the first ring and an\nexcited female voice said, “What is it now? Just come over already!”\nAnden, startled, asked to talk to Cory, and the woman said, “Oh, Seer’s balls, I’m sorry, I\nthought you were someone else. Just a minute.” She left the phone off the hook, yelling distantly,\n“Cory! It’s for you!” Anden waited. He could hear a great deal of background chatter and then a huge\ncheer as if a crowd was watching a sports event on television. At last, Cory’s voice came on the line.\n“Hey, islander!” he exclaimed. “How’s everything back in P-Mass?”\nAnden had a hard time speaking. “I miss you,” he said.\n“I miss you too. Midterms start next week, but I’ll try to come back for a visit the weekend after\nthat. You’re still free to gang about, right?”\n“That’s why I’m calling,” Anden said. “I’m going to be busy for a while.”\n“At work?”\n“Sort of,” Anden said. “Family things.”\n“You mean clan things.” Cory paused to say something in Espenian to someone else in the house\nbefore coming back on the line. “All right, well, you can spare at least one evening, right?”\nAnden’s palms were sweating. He had no idea how to do this. He forced the words out. “I don’t\nthink we can get together this time, Cory. You’re busy with school and I’m going to be busy too. I\nthink… maybe it would be best if we didn’t see each other for a while.”\nThere was a long, uncomprehending pause on the other end, and then a sound like Cory picking\nup the phone and walking—the background noise from the distant sports game grew fainter. “What’s\nthis about, crumb?” Cory demanded in a whisper. “Are you… breaking up with me?” Anden couldn’t\nanswer; his throat felt entirely closed up.\nCory breathed loudly into the phone. Then he said, “My da put you up to this, didn’t he? I know\nhe did. And you gave in. What did he say to you, huh? Did he offer you money?”\n“Nothing like that,” Anden muttered.\nCory said, “You know what? Fuck you. You dumb island fuck.” He hung up.\nAnden placed the receiver back in the cradle and sat down on the floor, staring at the phone for\nseveral minutes.

He walked for two hours, aimlessly, and at one point, he\nrealized he was crying. Not loudly, not hard, but his vision was blurry and his cheeks were wet. When\nhe finally arrived back at his apartment, it was past midnight. His shoes were soaked and his feet cold.\nHe ran hot water in the bath to warm them, then put on fresh socks.\nBack home, it would be midday, the springtime sun high over the city harbor, people in the\nstreets wishing each other Happy New Year and standing on ladders to take red lights and streamers\ndown from their eaves. Anden picked up his phone and dialed the operator to place a collect call to\nJanloon, so he could tell his cousins that Dauk Losunyin would help them to kill Zapunyo.\nTHIRD INTERLUDE\nThe Cursed Beauty\nE\night hundred years ago, a renowned Alusian explorer named Gaubrett sailed across the sea in\nsearch of a fabled island with mountains of jewels guarded by giants. Upon successfully landing on\nthe southern peninsula of Kekon, Gaubrett was pleased and relieved to encounter no giants but\ninstead an Abukei village. After a tense but peaceful exchange with the village elders, the natives\nbrought the half-starved travelers food and water, and Gaubrett and his crew set up camp by the\nshore. As grateful as they were, the sailors could not help but greedily notice the green gemstones\nhanging over the tribe’s simple dwellings and decorating the bodies of the men and women. Even\nbefore the rise of the Kekonese warrior caste of Green Bones, jade was of significant cultural\nimportance to the aboriginals, who viewed it as the divine remains of the First Mother goddess\nNimuma and, being genetically immune to its effects, wore it for status and ceremony.\nGaubrett proceeded to barter a considerable amount of his ship’s wares in exchange for the\nvillagers’ jade, which they seemed more than willing to trade in exchange for foreign tools and\ncuriosities. Gaubrett stored the acquired jade in a wooden chest in his tent, which he opened several\ntimes a day in order to admire his fortune. Once much-needed ship repairs had been completed,\nGaubrett and his crew made ready to set sail. At that point, it occurred to the explorer that there was a\ngreat deal more jade to be had, and that he had come an awfully long way across the ocean to be\nleaving with so little compared to how much these simple savages flaunted so carelessly.\nThat night, Gaubrett gathered his men and led them into the Abukei village where they\nmassacred the inhabitants and gathered every last bit of jade they could lay their hands on. In good\nspirits, they departed Kekon. Despite ample stores and good weather, over the following two months,\nthe ship descended into an inexplicable madness. Shortly after Gaubrett hung two officers for treason,\nthe crew mutinied; Gaubrett and several others were killed and their bodies tossed overboard. The\nstoreroom lock was smashed and the jade equally divided among the crew. Two subsequent mutinies\nresulted in several more deaths. Half a dozen sailors threw themselves into the sea; others fell into a"

Half a dozen sailors threw themselves into the sea; others fell into a\ndelirious fever and cut themselves with knives. One man was said to have pulled out his own eye and\neaten it. A small group of beleaguered survivors, at last convinced that the treasure they carried was\ncursed, threw every piece of jade on the ship into the ocean and managed to limp their vessel into a\nport in southeastern Spenius. Their tragic tale quickly spread, cementing the “cursed beauty” as a\nfaraway place of near mythical wealth and mysterious evil fortune.\nSeven hundred and fifty years after Gaubrett’s journey, the Shotarian general Damusaro\nfamously disagreed with the national War Cabinet’s decision to occupy Kekon, arguing, “That\ndamned island is like a beautiful woman with a barbed pussy—very tempting, but not to be fucked.”\nPerhaps as belated punishment for his vulgar objections, his superiors later sent him to command the\nGarrison House in occupied Janloon during the Many Nations War. His name was whispered by the\nOne Mountain Society, and despite obsessive security precautions, he was ambushed and killed in\nbroad daylight by a young Green Bone assassin named Nau Suenzen.\nCHAPTER\n54\nThe Body Doesn’t Lie\nS\non Tomarho came out of the shower humming a tune and walked into the sitting room of his two-\nstory house in the wealthy neighborhood of Green Plain. He startled to find a tall, older man sitting on\nhis sofa. At first he had no idea who the man was, though his eyes fell immediately upon the jade\ncarried on leather bands around the stranger’s wrists. Only when the intruder said, “Chancellor Son,\nI’m sorry to surprise you like this,” did Son recognize Nau Suen, the Horn of the Mountain, and he\nknew that, aisho notwithstanding, there was a better than average chance he would be dead in the next\nfive minutes.\nThe former chancellor of the Royal Council had been in some tight spots in his many decades of\nbusiness and political life, and he managed to keep cool and collected now, as he said, “Nau-jen,\nyou’ve caught me at a disadvantage, I’m afraid. I would’ve been happy to meet and speak to you at a\ntime when I wasn’t so… immodest.” He gestured self-deprecatingly at his semi-nudity. A towel\ncovered his lower body, but he was otherwise unclothed. “If you’ll wait, I’d prefer to put on some\nclothes.”\n“By all means,” said Nau. “Take your time.”\nSon retreated into his bedroom and put on pants and a shirt. His mind raced. During his years as\nchancellor, he’d been given a government security detail, but now that he was once again an ordinary\ncouncilman on his way to retirement, he’d deemed personal bodyguards to be unnecessary. He had a\nhome security system, and if he triggered an alarm, it would alert the security firm, which would\nsend… what? Some guards who would get here too late and be no match for a superior Green Bone\nlike Nau Suen anyway. No, he would have to survive by talking his way out of this, as he had more"

No, he would have to survive by talking his way out of this, as he had more\nthan once in his life before. Son smoothed down his wet hair so that it covered the bald spot on the\ntop of his head, put on his slippers, and walked back out to the sitting room. He gave the Horn of the\nMountain a polished but cheerless politician’s smile and sat down across from him. “Are you here to\nthreaten me?”\n“Not at all,” said Nau. “You’re a respected and senior statesman who’s served this country\nhonorably over your many years in politics. That would be uncouth of the Mountain clan. You must\nforgive me for my unexpected appearance; I needed to speak to you in private.”\nSon relaxed only slightly. “Well, then, what can I do for the Horn of the Mountain?”\nNau sat back and drummed his fingers on the armrests. He was an intense man who seemed\nyounger than his salt-and-pepper hair would suggest, and he had a piercing gaze that seemed not to\nblink as much as normal people. “My Pillar is concerned about the fate of the Oortokon Conflict\nRefugee Act,” Nau said. “The proposed legislation has been hotly debated and has languished in\ncommittees for more than a year. Now that a bill is finally coming to a vote, it appears that the Royal\nCouncil remains nearly evenly split on this issue and you, Chancellor, might cast the deciding vote\nwhen it is brought to the floor of Wisdom Hall next month. Where do you stand on the matter?”\n“There are strong arguments to be made on both sides of the issue,” Son said carefully. Some of\nthose arguments were continually imposing themselves upon him in the form of phone calls from\nAmbassador Mendoff. With the Oortokon War grinding to a stalemate, the Espenians were\nanticipating a longer-term standoff with their enemies and were more concerned than ever with\nensuring their regional allies resisted any potential Ygutanian infiltration. Son said, “In the end, I will\nhave to weigh the best interests of the nation and vote with my conscience.”\n“What if I were to tell you that the Mountain clan is deeply committed to making sure that anti-\nimmigration interests don’t interfere with our better nature as a country. We would urge all members\nof the Royal Council to give our brothers and sisters of Kekonese ancestry in Oortoko the asylum\nthey deserve from the predations of power-hungry imperialist foreigners. Would that sway your\ndecision?”\n“Nau-jen, I would listen to all reasonable arguments,” said Son.\n“What if I were to say that we could make it personally worth your while to vote for the bill?”\n“I am not in the Royal Council for personal gain, Nau-jen,” said Son with a strong note of\nindignation. “But I’m certainly willing to speak to you and to Ayt-jen about your concerns.”\nNau lowered his chin and regarded Son with calm understanding. “I don’t expect that would\nmake any difference, as you’ve already met with Kaul Shaelinsan and promised her that in order to\nmaintain No Peak’s preferential standing with the Espenians, you will use your chancellor emeritus"

Isn’t that true? You remain a\nNo Peak man through and through.”\nSon began to sweat. “If that’s what you believe, then why are you here, Nau-jen? The vote is\nclose, as you said. There are plenty of other members of the Council that you could try to sway to\nyour position.” He gambled now by interjecting a note of nonchalant disdain into his voice. “And if\nthe Mountain clan believes it can achieve its political aims by grossly violating aisho and simply\nkilling someone, why target a man like myself, who is so much in the public eye, whose murder\nwould be scrutinized?”\n“Because,” said Nau, leaning forward, “you are No Peak’s greatest political ally. Very few\ncouncilmen have the clout and influence that you do, Chancellor Son. And no one else has what you\nhave—an arterial blockage in the left ventricle of your heart, one that your doctors are keeping an eye\non because it poses a heart attack risk. I suspect that very few people know about it; you keep it quiet,\nnaturally, but the body doesn’t lie the way the mind does.”\nNau stood up. Chancellor Son stumbled to his feet, turned, and tried to run. He did not make it\nfar. Nau grabbed the fat man by the arm in a grip of Strength and pressed a hand to Son’s chest. Son’s\nheart was already thudding with fear; a light touch of Channeling was all that was required. The\nformer chancellor clutched his chest and gasped for breath. Nau released him and he fell to the\nground, his entire bulk rigid, his mouth open and working for air.\nIt would take only a few minutes of medical examination to conclude that Son Tomarho had died\nof natural causes. A few would not believe that; some members in the Royal Council might open an\ninvestigation that would reveal nothing, but people would whisper anyway, and that would serve the\nMountain’s purpose as well.\nNau stepped over Son’s body and made his way toward the door.\nCHAPTER\n55\nFinal Preparations\nT\nhe Kekon Journal is an independent weekly Kekonese-language newspaper published in Espenia,\nwith a wide circulation among overseas Kekonese. Its editorial stance has long been favorable to the\nKekonese government, but in recent years, and following a relocation from its original headquarters\nin Southtrap to a larger office on Jons Island, the newspaper has included more in-depth reporting and\ncritical coverage of Kekon’s clan system, Espenian foreign policy, and international regulation of\njade, among other topics of interest.\nUnder the guise of an Espenian-born journalist named Ray Caido, Anden requested a personal\ninterview with Zapunyo on behalf of the Kekon Journal. In his correspondence with Zapunyo’s aide\nIyilo, he emphasized that the expatriate Kekonese population was very interested in hearing opposing\nviewpoints regarding the jade trade; this would be the smuggler’s once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to"

All of Anden’s\nfalse credentials were meticulously supported, using the same No Peak resources that created and\nmaintained shell companies such as Divinity Gems, and with the help of the Dauks, who were owed\npersonal favors by the newspaper’s editor in chief from a time in the past when he had gotten into\nsome trouble with finances.\n“The thing about Zapunyo,” Hilo said over the phone, “is that he makes himself out to be a\nhumble Uwiwan farmer turned entrepreneur. When I met him, he could’ve spent the whole day telling\nme his fucking sob story and lecturing me about how it’s the Green Bone clans that are the real\nvillains for making his business so difficult. If there’s anything that’ll lure him into a face-to-face\nmeeting, it’s a chance to talk to someone who’ll listen to him.”\nThe Pillar’s assessment proved correct; after some back-and-forth correspondence with Iyilo,\nAnden was able to secure an interview with Zapunyo during the time when he would be in Port\nMassy, the day after his arrival in the city and before his scheduled surgery at Wigham-Cross\nTruthbearers Hospital. The meeting was scheduled to occur at the small Uwiwa Islands Cultural\nHeritage Center & Tea Gardens in the Quince area, which would afford a view of the Iron Eye Bridge\nand would present a good background for photographs. Anden would be unarmed and accompanied\nonly by Rohn Toro, posing as his photographer. Rohn’s black gloves would be carefully hidden on the\npremises the day before the event. During the false interview, Rohn would retrieve his gloves, put on\nhis jade, and kill Zapunyo.\nThe assassination plan was formed over several conversations at the Kaul family dinner table.\nSecrecy was of the utmost concern, since after Tau Maro’s betrayal, it was safe to assume that\nZapunyo might have other spies within No Peak circles and they could not risk any word of the plot\nreaching him in the Uwiwa Islands. In order to throw off any suspicion, false rumors and death\nthreats against the smuggler were deliberately set into motion, hinting at a more obvious plot that\ninvolved striking when he was in the hospital room recovering from surgery, when they knew the\nsmuggler was bound to take extreme precautions. A new phone with a speaker, connected to a secure\nline that was known only to immediate family, was installed in the dining room of the main house on\nthe Kaul estate so that Anden, waiting at designated times in his apartment in Port Massy, could be\nremotely brought into the discussion.\nAnden found this arrangement difficult; the meetings were always midmorning in his time zone,\nwhich disrupted his day, and being able to hear but not see what was going on gave him a strange and\nlonely feeling. He could picture all of them in the dining room—Hilo at the head of the table, a\ncigarette in hand, Tar next to him, Kehn’s empty chair, Wen filling teacups, Shae holding Jaya on her"

Sometimes Anden could hear the shouts of Niko and Ru playing in the other room or\ncoming over to the adults to ask for this or that and being told to say hello to their uncle Anden on the\nphone before being shooed away again.\nAt times Anden thought it almost comical that he would have to make some excuse to leave on\nan early, extra long lunch break from working at the Janloon Trade Partnership Liaison Office in\norder to take part in conversations with his family back in Janloon, all to plot the murder of a man he\nhad never met. He felt no moral qualms about assassinating Zapunyo, nor resentment over the efforts\nhe was being asked to make. He understood how important this was to his cousins as well as to Wen,\nwho always visited him on her business trips and whom he felt closer to now than he ever had while\nliving in Janloon. It was only ironic to him that this was how he would finally be returning to Kekon.\nAfter the deed was done, both Anden and Rohn Toro would have to leave the country. Anden was\ninstructed not to say anything beforehand to the Hians, or to his friends or coworkers. He had to be\nready to depart quickly, and Shae would take care of the rest. If all went according to plan, after three\nand half years in Espenia, he would be going home.\nAnden did not quite allow himself to believe it. In a way it seemed fitting, almost poetic: Killing\nGont Asch had ruined him as a Green Bone and led to his exile; this deed would end his time abroad\nand return him to Kekon with the proof that even without jade, he was not useless, he was still a force\nin the clan, still a Kaul. Not long ago, it would’ve been all Anden wanted, but now he faced it with\nbittersweet melancholy. He was impatient to return home, but not happy to leave Port Massy after all.\nWhen he’d arrived, he’d seen nothing but the impersonal concrete grayness of the vast foreign city.\nNow he could say that he’d seen the fierce, enterprising life that pulsed like jade aura through the\nveins of its streets and in the marrow of its steel structures. Port Massy had been and still was the\ntrading post of the world, a market where anything could be found, bought, and sold, a place that held\na little of everything in its grasp—even jade and Green Bones, along with uncountable other wonders\nknown and unknown—and still, somehow, was its own self, standing without compare. Anden would\nnever think of his biological father with anything but indifference and disdain, but now he thought\nthat perhaps the man was simply typical of his race and couldn’t be too badly blamed; Port Massy\nowed its unique glory to the mercenary wayfaring nature of the Espenian people, and as the meeting\nwith Zapunyo neared, Anden found himself appreciating, even admiring, the city more than he ever"

Wen was correct; he had friends here now, an independent life that he was proud of in\nmany ways, and he thought constantly and sorrowfully about what he was giving up.\nHe’d tried to call Cory again, on more than one occasion, hoping to explain things better than he\nhad in their last conversation, but his friend refused to answer any of his calls. He learned from the\nHians that Cory had taken an internship at a big law firm in AC and would not be returning to Port\nMassy over the summer. At times, Anden felt as if he’d made a terrible mistake, that he ought to take\nthe bus to Adamont Capita and find Cory in person and say that he’d been wrong—who cared what\nDauk Losun wanted? What did their families matter, what did law school or even the entire Amaric\nOcean matter? They could run away together; it would be daring and romantic. Lying awake with his\ncock in his hand, Anden would groan with the childishness of the thought and with the simultaneous\ndepressing certainty that he’d doomed himself to be alone forever; he was never going to find anyone\nelse like Cory, who wouldn’t even talk to him anymore.\nAt last, Anden sat down and wrote a letter, which he mused gloomily was a very cliché post-\nbreakup thing to do, but so be it. Cory, he wrote, You have every right to be angry at me, but I know\nthat you’re too good of a person to stay in a bad mood for long, and I hope that after a while, we’ll be\nable to remain friends. Don’t blame your da. It was my decision in the end. Even though it was one of\nthe hardest things I’ve ever had to do, I made the choice I hope is better for both of us. I can’t explain\neverything right now because they’re “clan things” like you said, but I will soon. Sitting at the\ncramped desk facing his tiny apartment window, Anden agonized over how much to justify himself,\nhow to sound sincere without being maudlin, starting and discarding several versions of the letter\nbefore deciding, fuck it, Cory was probably going to throw it in the trash without reading it anyway.\nYou were my first. You made Port Massy a special place for me, and you’re a better, more generous\nperson than I am. You deserve the best of everything.\nYour friend and “islander,” Anden.\nAnden mailed the letter to Cory’s address in Adamont Capita. Doing so was painful but took a\nburden off his mind, and afterward, he awaited Zapunyo’s forthcoming arrival with impatience. If all\nwent according to plan, in a few weeks he’d be on a flight back to Janloon. Of course, there was a\nreasonable chance he would be dead—shot by Zapunyo’s bodyguards, but he had seen Rohn Toro’s\nabilities and knew the man’s reputation was well earned, so he trusted in their odds of survival.\nHaving been trained at the Academy and raised in the Kaul family, Anden had been indoctrinated\nsince childhood with the idea that for Green Bones, the possibility of death was like the weather—"

On a Fourthday evening, the\nline of fashionably dressed twentysomethings waiting to get inside stretched down the block and\naround the corner. Once past the bouncers, partygoers lined up again at one of the two neon-lit bars,\nshouting over the throbbing beat of the music to place their drink orders. The main dance floor heaved\nwith the crush of sweaty bodies and pulsed with strobe lights. Upstairs, those hoping to have audible\nconversations lounged on the clusters of red sofas or, if they were particularly well heeled, rented one\nof the fifteen soundproof suites with a private bar and server. One of these rooms was regularly\nreserved for Ven Haku, Fist of the Mountain and scion of the K-Star Freight fortune, to use whenever\nhe wished to entertain his many friends.\nHaku was leaning back on one of the sofas now, and despite the glass of hoji in his hand and a\ncouple of pretty girls on either side of him, he wore a brooding, impatient expression. When his most\nsenior Finger said something funny, he didn’t laugh along with everyone else. After the next round of\ndrinks, Haku motioned the server and the disappointed girls out of the room and sat forward, inducing\nthe five other men in the room—all of them Mountain Green Bones with considerable jade and\nreputations—to quiet their banter and give him their attention.\n“Is everyone ready?” Haku asked. “You’re all clear on the plan? If anything goes wrong this\nweek, we’ll all lose our heads, so there’s no room for error. We’re committed now.”\nThe men around the room nodded. One of them said, “We haven’t been able to reach either\nSunto-jen or Uwan-jen. We don’t know whether they’ll stand with us or against us.”\n“We have to go ahead, anyway,” Haku said. His father had made that abundantly clear in their\nrecent conversations. They were running out of time. “No matter which way Sunto or Uwan or the\nother Fists go, once Ayt’s gone, the Kauls will support us.” That was what Ven Sando had told him,\nand Haku had not questioned it. He trusted his father, who was a seasoned corporate executive, to\nhandle the matter of clan alliances and getting the Lantern Men to fall in line; Haku only had to worry\nabout the actual logistics of the coup, which was no small feat in itself.\n“Just remember to kill Ayt first,” Haku reminded them. “Doesn’t matter how good that woman is\nat dueling and whispering names, an ambush from six of—”\nHe would’ve said more, but one of the other Fists interrupted, with sudden alarm, “Do you\nPerceive that?”\nThe men quieted, jade senses alert.

At first, Haku discerned nothing out of the ordinary—merely\nthe background energy din of all the people enjoying themselves in the club. That was one reason he\nchose to meet here with his coconspirators: It was easy for even the auras of half a dozen Fists and\nFingers together to go unnoticed in such a crowded and lively environment. The club was a tributary\nMountain property and there were always other Green Bones among the general throng. Haku’s\nPerception was not especially strong, but after a minute, he realized that several jade auras were\nmoving from their scattered positions in the building and congregating on the second floor—right\noutside of their room. Haku drew his talon knife and threw open the door.\n“Ven Haku-jen,” said Nau Suen, walking into the room ahead of a group of eight other Green\nBones, “I’m too old for the clubbing scene, but I’m told that you throw good parties here.”\n“Nau-jen,” Haku said, sheathing his talon knife and dipping into a respectful salute. His eyes\ndarted over Nau’s other men and his heart began to pound. “You startled me.” Haku was not sure how\nthe Horn did it, but Nau Suen had a way of quieting his jade aura to such a low, even hum that he\nmoved inconspicuously even to jade senses and seemed to appear out of nowhere. “My friends and I\nalways have this room. If I knew you were interested in joining us, I’d have invited you.”\nNau glanced around at Ven Haku’s comrades. “Nau-jen,” they murmured in unison, touching\ntheir foreheads. Nau nodded at them, then rubbed his chin with a thumb and said, “Haku-jen, you’re\none of the clan’s senior Fists, but I haven’t seen much of you in person for months now. I think we\nought to talk about all the time you’ve been spending at the Sin 8 in these parties.”\nHaku did his best to remain calm. The Horn did not know anything—could not possibly know\nanything about their schemes. The most he might have were suspicions. “I haven’t been neglecting\nany of my duties,” he said, with a note of defensiveness. “If I haven’t been checking in as often, it’s\nbecause I’ve been helping my father. He’s busy with K-Star Freight these days.”\n“I suppose that’s true,” Nau said. “You’re an obedient son, Ven Haku, but unfortunately a terrible\nliar. Your heart rate and blood pressure are up, your eyes are twitching, you’re sweating. You\nwouldn’t even pass a simple lie detector test, much less fool my sense of Perception, which is no\ndoubt why you’ve been making an effort to avoid me.”\nHaku went for his talon knife. He lunged at Nau’s throat, but two of the Horn’s men were\nalready moving. With combined Strength, they bore the young Fist to the ground and pinned him to\nthe floor. Haku screamed and pleaded his innocence, he tried to Deflect and Channel; two other men\ncame over and helped to hold him down. Waun Balu, who was Nau’s First Fist, said in a regretful,"

Waun Balu, who was Nau’s First Fist, said in a regretful,\nalmost gentle voice, “Don’t make it worse for yourself, Haku.” The traitor did not take Waun’s\nadvice; as his head was pulled back, he Steeled for all he was worth, and so it took a full grisly\nminute for Waun to saw across his throat with the talon knife.\nTwo of Haku’s accomplices tried to come to his aid, and one of them tried to escape by crashing\nbodily through the door. They were blocked and forced into a line against the far wall by Nau’s other\nmen, who drew handguns whose bullets could not possibly be Deflected at such close range. If\nanyone outside of the room heard the noise through the walls and over the pounding music, they did\nnot investigate. No one, including the bouncers, would be so foolish as to interfere. When Haku was\nfinally dead, Nau Suen barked in disgust, “Is it not enough that we have to contend with foreigners\nand criminals and with the No Peak clan? We have to fight among ourselves, and fear disloyalty and\ntreachery from within our own brotherhood?”\nThe five Green Bones who’d conspired with Ven and his father dropped to their knees and\npressed their heads to the ground. They were all Fists and senior Fingers, respectable fighters in their\nown right, but with their plotting exposed and Ven dead, they were not stupid enough to think they\ncould stand against the clan or run from its justice. Nau said to them, “You all deserve death, for\nscheming to assassinate the Pillar and install that weakling in her place. Do you repent your part in\nthis treason? Do you swear on your jade and the lives of your family members to give Ayt-jen your\ncomplete and unequivocal loyalty from now on?”\nWith collective vehemence, the men said that they did, and thanked the Horn for his mercy. Nau\nSuen studied the handful of kneeling Green Bones for a long minute. Then he pointed out three of the\nfive. “Those three,” he said, and from where they were standing behind the prisoners, Waun Balu and\nhis men slit each of the indicated throats and pushed the bodies face-first to the floor. The two\nremaining survivors turned pale with anticipation of death.\nNau said, “Your three friends weren’t sincere; they would’ve waited to seek revenge for Haku or\nbetrayed the clan in some other way. The two of you, however, are being truthful.” The Horn fixed\nthem with a terrifying stare. “You’ll be exiled from Janloon, to do work for the Mountain elsewhere\nin the country, and if you ever go against the Pillar again, you know what will happen to you and your\nfamilies.”\nOne of the spared men asked permission to draw his talon knife. He sliced off his left ear and\nlaid it on the floor, head bowed and blood running down his neck. His companion swallowed. “The\nclan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master,” he murmured quickly, and followed suit.\nVen Sando was in a senior management meeting with the leadership team of K-Star Freight the\nfollowing morning when the door to the boardroom opened unexpectedly and Ayt Madashi strode in,"

The Pillar of the Mountain\nlooked down the long table of company executives and said, “Gentlemen, I apologize for the\ninterruption. The Weather Man’s office has received an offer of purchase for K-Star Freight from a\ncredible and interested party, and I must discuss it with Ven-jen privately before we make the news\npublic to shareholders.”\nThe vice presidents murmured, looking at each other in surprise and confusion, but they departed\nwithout arguing. When they were gone, Ven rose from his leather chair at the end of the table and\nsaid, affronted, “I haven’t been approached by any buyers. Besides, K-Star is not for sale.” His gaze\nlanded suspiciously on Nau Suen and the two Fists behind him, one of them carrying a cardboard\nfiling box. If this was a business discussion, why were the Horn and his men here? Ven knew the\nanswer, and despite his best efforts to appear normal, his hands began to shake.\nAyt motioned forward two strangers. They were not Kekonese. “These men are here to buy out\nyour family’s majority ownership of K-Star Freight. Iwe-jen has prepared all the paperwork.” Iwe\nKalundo, the clan’s Weather Man, was a dark, bald man with square black glasses frames. He placed\nhis briefcase on the table and extracted a file folder with several documents, which he walked over to\nVen and placed in front of the man.\nVen picked up the folder and flung it back across the table at Ayt, scattering pages. “Never,” he\ndeclared. “I’ll never sell. You’re making a terrible strategic mistake by trying to oust me. K-Star is\none of the Mountain clan’s largest tributary entities, one of the largest corporations in Kekon. There\naren’t any other companies with the capital to buy us out, and certainly none with the world-class\nexpertise in transportation logistics to be able to take over our operations. If I leave, my entire\nmanagement team leaves with me. K-Star will fail, and so will the Kekonese freight industry. The\nMountain clan needs K-Star and the Ven family.”\nAyt Mada said, “You’re admirably confident for a clan traitor who is facing death, Ven-jen. Yes,\nK-Star is one of the largest companies in Kekon, and that would seem to make the Ven family\nindispensable. But the world is much bigger than Kekon these days; I would think that someone\nworking in the transportation business would appreciate that.”\n“You would put K-Star in the hands of foreigners?” Ven exclaimed in disbelief.\n“Fifty-one percent of the company will be acquired by YGL Transport, headquartered out of\nBursvik. I’m confident that these new owners have the operational capabilities to capably run K-Star\nin your absence. The other forty-nine percent of K-Star will remain under the control of selected\nKekonese shareholders within the Mountain.”\nAt the Pillar’s nod, the Fist holding the closed cardboard filing box came forward and set it on\nthe table. Ayt said, “Your eldest son, Haku—his head is inside this box. I’ll spare you by not opening"

I’ve been thinking that Kaul Hilo has been\nacting unusually restrained as of late, and now it’s clear why. Sign the papers, Ven-jen. You come\nfrom an old Green Bone family; none of this should surprise you.”\nVen’s fragile mask of indignation and bluster collapsed; his chin trembled and his shoulders\nbegan to shudder. “My other children,” he whispered. “They had nothing to do with this. Spare them,\nAyt-jen. I’ll sign the papers, I’ll instruct my managers to stay on after the sale, I’ll do whatever else\nyou ask of me before I die, if only you’ll spare the rest of my family.”\n“Your sons, no,” Ayt replied. “Your wife and daughters can leave the country in exile. I’ll allow\nyou and your male children to be buried with your jade in the family plot on Kekon. That’s all the\naccommodation I can give to a man who has betrayed his Pillar.”\nIwe Kalundo gathered the strewn documents back together and showed Ven Sandolan each of\nthe places he was required to sign.\nCHAPTER\n57\nEmergencies\nO\nn the day that No Peak’s spies had told him Zapunyo was scheduled to arrive in Port Massy, Hilo\nfed his sons dinner, then took his own meal to the sofa in the living room and watched the news while\nawaiting the call from his cousin to confirm that all the arrangements were in place. Wen was in\nAdamont Capita for the week, consulting on the redesign of the Kekonese embassy and scouting out\nproperties of potential investment interest to the Weather Man’s office. Shae often came over to eat in\nthe main house, but she was still at work on Ship Street, so Hilo was home alone with his children\nexcept for his mother planting flower bulbs outside in the garden and Kyanla puttering around in the\nkitchen.\nOn the television, anchorman Toh Kita was reporting on the recent narrow passage of the\nOortokon Conflict Refugee Act, which would make Kekon one of several nations to commit to taking\nrefugees from the war-ravaged region on the border of Shotar and Ygutan. Chancellor Guim was\ngiving a speech in Wisdom Hall about the terrible human cost of foreign imperialism and the\nimportance of Kekon stepping up as a responsible world citizen. He closed his address by expressing\nsadness over the recent passing of his predecessor, Son Tomarho, a devoted statesman and servant of\nthe country, let the gods recognize him.\nHilo scowled at the screen. The Espenians were going to be unhappy about the passing of the\nRefugee Act. It would fall on Shae to deal with the brunt of the diplomatic fallout, but Hilo wished\nChancellor Son had managed to keep his heart pumping for a while longer. He had gotten used to\nSon.

The coroner said there\nwas no question Son Tomarho had died of cardiac arrest, but Hilo wasn’t one to believe in convenient\naccidents.\nJaya had thrown all her toys out of the playpen and was demanding to be picked up. Hilo knew\nhe had a five-minute grace period before she threw a tantrum, so he finished his meal—a bowl of\nleftover ginger chicken stew—and held his daughter on his lap, trying to entertain her with a puppet.\nHilo liked being a father and found it suited him. Children were completely honest and lived in the\nmoment; they were demanding, but also easy to please, asking only for simple love and attention. He\nwouldn’t object to having more of them, if Wen was not determined to have a meaningful career\nwithin the clan, which he supported for the sake of her happiness but still thought was not entirely\nnecessary.\nThe phone rang. Expecting it to be Anden, Hilo handed the toddler to Kyanla and picked up the\nreceiver in the kitchen. Juen said, “Hilo-jen, there are some… rumors going on.”\nEven after more than a year, there were times when Hilo heard Juen’s voice on the phone and\nwondered, for a second, why Kehn had sent his First Fist instead of phoning himself. It never failed to\ngive him painful pause. Hilo said, “Rumors are as common as rats; what’s so special about these\nones?”\n“Ven Sandolan, the big businessman, the one who owns the shipping company—he’s dead.\nExecuted by the Mountain for treason. Apparently, he tried to organize a coup against Ayt Mada but\nhis plans were discovered. People are shocked; he was one of their top Lantern Men.”\nHilo muted the television. “What about his sons?”\n“Dead as well, along with a number of other conspirators. They say Nau Suen and his men\ncaught Ven Haku and some other Fists plotting at the Sin 8 nightclub and slit their throats.”\n“Ayt wiped out the wealthiest Green Bone bloodline in her clan? And none of the other families\nin the Mountain are rioting?” Hilo demanded in disbelief.\n“Ayt’s taken Koben Ato as her ward,” Juen said. “From now on, she’ll be paying for his studies\nat Wie Lon, training him privately at the Ayt mansion, bringing him under her wing. She isn’t\nofficially calling the kid her heir, but it’s a big enough change that she’s bought the support of the\nKobens and everyone who’s on their side.”\n“And the Iwe family?”\n“Quiet. The word is that Ayt handed them a huge share of K-Star Freight.”\n“Godsdamnit,” Hilo snarled under his breath, taken aback and furious at how suddenly it had\nhappened, how quickly his designs had unraveled. Nonetheless, he was unable to contain a grudging\nadmiration. Ayt had played her hand beautifully; after the destruction of the Ven family, no one else in\nthe Mountain would dare to oppose her.

Hilo’s meetings with\nVen Sando, the behind-the-scenes payments and secret assurances, his calculated stoking of the\ninternal divisions in the Mountain with provocations and violence, all of it building his hope for the\npast three years that the Mountain clan would take down No Peak’s longtime enemy on its own and\ntear itself to pieces—all for nothing. “Why the fuck is that bitch so hard to kill?”\n“Uncle,” Niko said, tugging on Hilo’s shirt sleeve.\n“Not now, Niko.”\n“Uncle.” This time it was not the boy’s voice or the renewed tugging on his arm that made Hilo\nturn to look down at his nephew, but the strong surge of confusion and fear that Hilo Perceived in the\nboy—his little heart was beating like a drum. Niko was not a temperamental child, not the sort to get\nupset easily or be fearful of harmless things, but his eyes were wide with distress.\nHilo instructed Juen to learn what else he could and report back once he had more information.\nHe hung up and said, “What is it? What’s wrong?”\n“Ru… he… he… we were playing, and he… he ate them!”\n“Ate what?” Hilo said. “Where is he?” He followed Niko to the study and as soon as he entered\nthe room, Hilo understood. A terrible dread dropped his heart into his stomach. A small cloth bag of\njade buttons, long ago confiscated from the shipment of garments on the MV Amaric Pride, was lying\nopen on the coffee table. Several small jade pieces were lying scattered or stacked on the glass\nsurface; the boys had obviously found them in Hilo’s unlocked desk drawer and had been playing\nwith them. Ru was sitting curled on the ground in the corner behind the sofa, holding a throw pillow\nto his chest and face, as if, by hiding behind it, he could avoid his father’s anger.\nHilo strode over and pulled the pillow away. He crouched down, gripping his son by the arms.\n“What happened?” he demanded, hoping the boys would grin, that it would be a joke they were\nplaying to scare him, though he knew as soon as he saw Ru’s tear-stained face that it wasn’t.\nNiko was the one who answered. “He swallowed them.”\n“I didn’t mean to!” Ru blurted, his cheeks reddening. He shot his cousin a baleful glare of\nbetrayal. “It was your fault! I was going to spit them out, but you had your hand over my mouth!”\n“Why would you do that?” Hilo shouted at both of them. They had been taught that jade was to\nbe worn and handled by adults, that it was not for playing with. They ought to have known better.\n“We were just pretending.” Niko was on the verge of tears himself.\nHilo’s desire to give them both a beating was blotted out by fury with himself—he hadn’t\nthought the boys would play in the study, he should’ve locked the jade in the drawer, why had he left\nit out so carelessly?—and a more urgent, intense fear. Jade inside a small child’s body was dangerous.\nIt could cause fever, erratic heartbeat, seizures, collapse, and death."

Jade inside a small child’s body was dangerous.\nIt could cause fever, erratic heartbeat, seizures, collapse, and death.\nHilo scooped his son up in his arms. He shouted for Kyanla to take care of Jaya and Niko as he\ngrabbed the keys to the Duchesse and ran for the door. Niko, crying now, ran after him. “I’m coming\ntoo.” He clung to Hilo’s waist. “Don’t leave me.”\nHilo threw open the back door of the Duchesse Signa and piled both children onto the seat. Ru\nstared at his father with wide, frightened eyes. “Am I going to die?”\n“No,” Hilo said. He got in and started the car.\nAt Janloon General Hospital, the emergency room staff hurried Ru into an examination room. An X-\nray revealed two button-sized jade stones, which thankfully had not lodged in the boy’s esophagus on\nthe way down but were now trapped inside his stomach. Ru was hooked up to machines to monitor\nhis heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. A white-haired doctor came in and explained that he\nbelieved the stones could be removed without surgery. Ru would be sedated and a flexible grasping\ntool inserted down his throat to try and extract the pieces of jade. Hilo sat next to the bed holding his\nson’s small, sweaty hand in his own while the boy was put under anesthesia.\n“Are you mad at me?” Ru asked, his voice turning groggy.\n“No.” He was too afraid to be angry. “I love you.” He smoothed Ru’s hair. The boy’s forehead\nfelt warm and damp; Hilo wasn’t sure if it was a jade-induced fever or merely exertion from crying.\n“I want Ma,” Ru whimpered.\n“You’ll see her when you wake up,” Hilo promised. Uncontrollably, his mind flashed to the\nworst possible outcome he could imagine: having to call his wife while she was thousands of\nkilometers away on a business trip to tell her that their son had died of jade poisoning while under his\nwatch. He felt ill at the thought and told himself that would not happen.\nA nurse had brought in a small stack of board books and a toy truck for Niko to play with, but\nafter a cursory look, the boy ignored them. He sat on a chair next to Hilo with his knees drawn up to\nhis chest, hugging his legs. After the initial bout of tears in the car, his eyes were dry. He stared\naround at everything with interest and faint hostility, but he had not spoken since they got to the\nhospital.\nHilo looked at his wristwatch. It was past dinnertime; they’d been in the emergency room for\ntwo hours already. It would be midmorning on the east coast of Espenia. By now, Anden was\nsupposed to have phoned to confirm that Zapunyo had arrived in Port Massy and that all the\narrangements were in place. Unable to reach Hilo at the house, he would’ve phoned the Weather\nMan’s office.

The white-haired doctor assured Hilo that the procedure would\nnot take long. “You’re not the first Green Bone family to have had this happen, Kaul-jen,” the doctor\nsaid. “As long we get the jade out quickly, there’s no permanent harm. SN1 isn’t recommended for\nchildren, but we can use small doses if it looks like that’ll be necessary.”\nHilo thanked the doctor, then took Niko by the hand and went into the lobby of the hospital. He\nsat his nephew down on a chair near the bank of pay phones. “Are you hungry? Do you need to go to\nthe bathroom?” The boy shook his head. Hilo bought him a bag of crackers and a bottle of fruit juice\nfrom the vending machine anyway, and keeping the boy in sight, he called the house. After assuring a\nworried Kyanla that Ru would be fine, he asked her to retrieve his address book from the study and to\nsearch up the phone number of the hotel Wen was staying at in Adamont Capita. He wrote the number\non his hand, then depressed the phone hook and deposited enough coins to place a long-distance\nphone call. When the call was transferred to Wen’s hotel room, it rang and rang but there was no\nanswer. Hilo hung up. He called the Weather Man’s office on Ship Street.\n“Where have you been?” Shae sounded more flustered than he was used to hearing from her; he\ncould practically sense the crackle of her jade aura even over the phone. When he explained what had\nhappened, her irritation turned to concern. Say whatever else he might about his sister, but she was\nalways caring toward the children. “Is Ru going to be all right?”\n“The doctor thinks so. I’ll find out soon.” He said, “What have you heard from Andy?”\n“There’s a problem,” Shae said. “Zapunyo won’t meet in the room we’ve arranged at the\nUwiwan Cultural Center. Maybe something’s spooked him. Or maybe he intended to change the\nlocation all along, to throw off any potential threat. He’s insisting that the interview take place in his\nhotel room, with his bodyguards. Otherwise he refuses to meet at all.”\nHilo cursed. This changed everything. “We can’t get jade into Zapunyo’s hotel room,” he said at\nlast. “It’s too late for that.”\n“Anden and I have been talking about it,” Shae said. “If we go ahead with the interview, we\ncould have a weapon brought up to the room by someone posing as a room service waiter. If it were\nhidden in a napkin or under a tray, and Rohn Toro could get to it before anyone questioned who’d\nmade the order—”\n“No,” Hilo said. “Zapunyo’s already suspicious; he would know right away.”\n“Then we’re out of options. The interview is supposed to happen six hours from now.”\nHilo’s grip around the phone receiver tightened. His son was in the hospital, his wife was on the\nother side of the world, and his cousin was about to walk, jadeless and unarmed, into a hotel room to\nface one of the clan’s enemies and a posse of barukan gangsters."

He would attempt to smuggle a jade weapon\ninto the room, or try to seize one off of Zapunyo’s guards. He would risk his own life to stab Zapunyo\nthrough the throat with a ballpoint pen if need be.\nBut he was not there. There were so many things that as Pillar he could not accomplish solely\nwith his own will and strength, that relied instead on other people, even in matters as personal as\nvengeance. Andy was over there, alone. The last time Hilo had asked his cousin to kill on behalf of\nthe clan, it had driven the young man away from the family and ruined him as a Green Bone. Hilo\nwould go to great lengths to defeat an enemy and had done so in the past, but at this moment,\nwatching his little nephew eat the last of the crackers and brush the crumbs from his lap, he thought\nonly of the safety of his family.\n“Call it off,” Hilo said.\n“If we don’t go through with the interview,” Shae said, “Zapunyo will know it was rigged from\nthe start. The cover we’ve created for Anden will be blown and we won’t get another chance.”\n“We’re not going to have Andy go through a two-hour fake interview for no gain, not when all\nit’ll take is a single slip—someone in the room realizing that he isn’t who he says he is—for him to\nget shot in the head. We’ll have to think of some other way to get to Zapunyo,” he said. “Call it off,\nShae.”\nHilo got off the phone with the Weather Man. He took Niko by the hand and walked back to the\nroom where they would bring Ru once the doctors were done with the procedure. His mind was\nchurning with anger, knowing that months of careful groundwork and scheming would come to\nnothing. Coming on top of the news about Ven, he felt as if surely nothing else could go wrong today,\nbut when the doctor came into the room, he had a look of apprehension on his face that turned Hilo\ncold.\n“Where’s my son?” the Pillar demanded, in such a sharp and deadly voice that the doctor\nblanched.\n“They’re bringing him back right now,” the doctor said hastily. “The procedure went smoothly,\nand he’ll come out from under the anesthesia in an hour or so.” The doctor handed Hilo a plastic\ncontainer, of the sort used to collect urine samples, sealed with a red lid. The offending pieces of jade\nclinked around at the bottom of it. “He’ll recover fully, Kaul-jen, but there’s something you should\nknow. Your son is nonreactive to jade. We expected to see some change in his vital signs as a result of\nthat amount of jade exposure, but there wasn’t any at all. He might as well have swallowed a cherry\npit.”\nHilo said, “Isn’t he too young for you to tell for certain?”\n“It’s possible for children to show wide fluctuations in their responses to jade—from minimal to"

But no response at all… We can be quite sure he’s\nnonreactive.”\nIt annoyed Hilo how the doctor kept saying the word nonreactive as if the technical term was\nsomehow softer and kinder than stone-eye. When the man had come in looking so grave, Hilo had\nfeared the worst. This news was not so bad in comparison. He was not shocked; given that Wen was a\nstone-eye, he’d always known this was a possibility. He had hoped, of course, that it would not be\ntrue, but now that he knew for certain that it was, he found himself accepting the idea with some\nindefinable combination of disappointment, relief, and parental defensiveness. So his son was a stone-\neye; why was the doctor acting so serious and concerned, as if that were some kind of fatal disease?\nOne would think that a medical professional wouldn’t subscribe to the old Kekonese superstitions\nabout stone-eyes being bad luck. Or was it because he thought Hilo would take the news badly, that\nthe Pillar of a Green Bone clan wouldn’t love his own son anymore just because he couldn’t wear\njade?\n“There are worse things to be than a stone-eye,” Hilo said, forcing a smile he did not really feel\nbut that he hoped would make the doctor stop gazing at him worriedly from overtop his spectacles.\n“The important thing is that he’s healthy and loved. It doesn’t matter what other people think.”\n“Quite right, Kaul-jen,” said the doctor, his shoulders coming down.\nRu was wheeled back into the room. He looked a little pale, but his chest rose and fell in gentle,\neven breaths. The nurse inclined the top of the bed and arranged the pillows to make the sleeping boy\nmore comfortable before departing. Niko had watched the entire conversation between Hilo and the\ndoctor without a word. When the three of them were alone, he asked, “Is Ru really a stone-eye?”\nHilo tried but did not quite succeed in keeping the sadness from his voice. “Yes.”\n“Is it because of what happened? Because I accidentally made him swallow jade?”\nHilo sighed and pulled his nephew onto his lap. “No, he was born that way. It’s not anyone’s\nfault.”\nNiko frowned at his sleeping cousin. “Will he be a stone-eye forever?”\n“He’ll always be a stone-eye, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of things he can do. Look\nat your ma, on a business trip right now, doing useful work for the family and the clan, even without\njade.” Hilo turned stern. “You’ll have to protect him, though. Keep him safe. No more scares like we\nhad today. Understand?”\nNiko nodded. “Yes. I won’t tease him anymore. I’ll be a good big brother from now on.”\nCHAPTER\n58\nWhite Rat’s Decision\nW\nhen Wen returned to the Capita View Hotel, hoping for a nap after a morning of meetings and\nlooking at flooring and paint samples, the bellman at the front desk told her that her husband had been"

        "text": "White Rat’s Decision\nW\nhen Wen returned to the Capita View Hotel, hoping for a nap after a morning of meetings and\nlooking at flooring and paint samples, the bellman at the front desk told her that her husband had been\ntrying to reach her for some time and had left a message and phone number for her to phone him back\nat Janloon General Hospital. Wen hurried up to her room. She told herself not to panic, but her hands\nwere shaking as she used the calling card Shae had given her to place the long-distance phone call. A\nreceptionist answered and told her to wait.\nSeveral agonizing minutes later, Hilo came onto the line. “Everyone’s fine,” he said right away.\n“We had a little scare, that’s all.” He told her about what had happened to Ru. Then he put Niko on\nthe line to say, “Hi, Ma, we miss you, when are you coming home?”\nWen assured him she would be home in three days, asked him if he’d been practicing his reading\nand handwriting every day, then asked for the phone to be returned to his uncle.\n“Do the doctors think this will have any long-term effect?” she asked Hilo.\n“It won’t,” Hilo said. “The doctors say that Ru’s a stone-eye.”\nWen sat down hard on the edge of her hotel room bed. Her first reaction was surprise that Hilo\nsounded so unemotional about it, but then again, he’d had several hours to come to terms with the\nnews, and she was hearing the diagnosis just now. Her voice came out small. “They’re sure?”\n“They’re sure.” Hilo still didn’t sound upset, but there was an impatient edge to his voice, the\none that he sometimes used to say, “Nothing,” or “Fine,” but that Wen always knew to be a sign that\nhe was preoccupied or worried.\nWen felt unexpected tears prick her eyes. “I’m sorry.”\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” he said, then as if realizing he’d snapped at her, he said in a gentler voice,\n“I said everyone’s fine, didn’t I? That’s what’s important. Don’t worry, and don’t let it ruin your trip.”\n“What else aren’t you telling me?” Wen asked. “I can tell there’s something else.”\n“It’s nothing to do with you at all. Clan things.”\nWen glanced at the clock. “Does it have to do with the plan to kill Zapunyo?”\nHilo sighed as if giving up. “That Uwiwan coward won’t leave his hotel room to meet at the\nplace we’ve arranged. It’s too risky for Andy to try anything now. The plan’s been called off. We can’t\nget to him this time, Wen.”\n“Not this time,” Wen repeated. “When, then? You promised me, on the day that Kehn was\nmurdered, that we would get the people who did this. All of them. It’s been more than a year.”\n“You think I don’t know that?” Hilo made a frustrated noise. “You’re upset right now because\nwhile you were away, I wasn’t paying enough attention to the boys and so this accident happened. But\nwhen have I ever failed to do what I promised? Have I ever left an offense against our family\nunpunished? Sometimes it takes longer, is all.”"

        "text": "when have I ever failed to do what I promised? Have I ever left an offense against our family\nunpunished? Sometimes it takes longer, is all.”\nThere was some distraction in the background of the hospital and Hilo turned away from the\nphone to speak to someone briefly before coming back onto the line. “I have to go; they’re\ndischarging Ru and I have to fill out some paperwork.” A pause. “I didn’t want to trouble you with\nbad news. It’s not even that bad. Could’ve been a lot worse; we should be grateful it wasn’t. And\ndon’t worry about the clan things. We’ll talk when you get home. I love you.”\n“I love you too,” Wen said. “Tell the boys their ma loves them.” After Hilo hung up, Wen stared\nat the silent receiver for a long moment before putting it back in its cradle. She felt leaden.\nMechanically, she got up and changed into more comfortable clothes, drank a soda from the minibar,\nthen wandered her hotel room in a daze, before sitting back down on the bed.\nShe felt as if she wanted to cry, but the sensation was too indistinct, everything was happening\ntoo far away. If she were with her family, it would feel more real. She thought, My son is a stone-eye.\nShe imagined Ru lying in a hospital bed, calling out for her, and with a surge of instinctive maternal\ndesperation, she wished she was there to hug him tightly and comfort him. But she was also strangely\nrelieved she was not there, that she did not have to look into his trusting face and lie to him by telling\nhim everything was fine, because of course it was not fine. She felt herself detaching in a way, pulling\naway defensively from all the unkind thoughts that came to her: Ru could not attend the Academy, he\ncould not be a Green Bone like his father and his uncles, he could not hold any significant rank in No\nPeak. He would be like his mother, ignored and dismissed, fighting the stigma of bad luck his entire\nlife, only he was a boy so it would be even worse for him, because men needed to command to be\nrespected, and who would follow a stone-eye?\nWith painful, revelatory honesty, she admitted to herself why, from the moment she’d seen\nNiko’s baby picture in the letter among Lan’s papers, she’d been so invested in bringing him back to\nJanloon, why she’d insisted that Hilo go in person to Stepenland to retrieve the boy so he could be\nraised with their own children. Perhaps she had suspected it all along; certainly the possibility had\ntroubled her during her first pregnancy: Her son, Ru, could not be his father’s heir.\nNiko was the child she couldn’t bear herself; he was the true first son of No Peak. It was an irony\nthat he’d been born to a woman as ungrateful and faithless as Eyni, but the gods had a cruel sense of\nhumor, that was something even Hilo and Shae agreed on. All that mortals could do was accept the lot\nthey were given, and yet still fight to better their own fate and that of their loved ones. Alone in the\nhotel room far from home, Wen was overcome with such a baffling mixture of pride and shame that\nher vision finally did blur with tears."

        "text": "hotel room far from home, Wen was overcome with such a baffling mixture of pride and shame that\nher vision finally did blur with tears.\nShe dried her eyes and began to think clearly again. She understood that her value in the clan,\nher value to her family, to Hilo, and most of all, in her own mind, lay not in what she could\naccomplish herself—because a stone-eye was always something of a blank space amid the strong\nauras around them, a void where gazes and expectations slid off like oil—but in what she made\npossible for others. She was unable to wield jade herself, but as a White Rat for the Weather Man, she\nhad taken jade to those who could and would use it for the clan’s gain. She had not borne the Pillar a\nson who could follow in the family’s footsteps, but she had ensured that Niko was brought back to be\nraised in his rightful place. She could never be a Green Bone herself, as much as she felt she was one\nat heart, but she could think like a Green Bone. She was an enabler, an aide, a hidden weapon, and\nthat was worth something. Perhaps a great deal.\nWen picked the phone back up and called the Weather Man’s office.\nShae was silent for a long minute after Wen finished speaking. “I can’t agree to that.”\n“You want Zapunyo dead as much as I do,” Wen said. “You’ve spent months preparing for this\nopportunity and you know it’s the best one we’re going to get. If we don’t take it, Zapunyo will\ndisappear back into his fortress.”\nThe arguments were not dissimilar to what Shae had said to Hilo over the phone less than an\nhour ago, but now Shae made excuses. “We don’t have time to change the plan.”\n“Have you canceled the interview yet?” Wen asked. Shae had not. She had been delaying, trying\nto think of a way to handle the situation that would salvage the cover identity that had been so\npainstakingly crafted for Anden.\nWen said, “We still have five hours before the interview. I can be on a bus to Port Massy in less\nthan thirty minutes. It takes three hours to get there. That leaves an hour and a half to spare.” Wen\npaused. When she spoke again, her voice was calmly entreating. “Have I let you down before, Shae-\njen? When I first told you I would be your White Rat, did you not believe I could do anything that\nyou asked of me?”\nShae closed her eyes and leaned her head back, the phone cord pulled taut. “Wen,” she said, “this\nis more dangerous than what you’ve done before. Even if it succeeds, there will be no way to hide it\nfrom Hilo. You would be risking your marriage, as well as your life.”\nWen was silent for a minute. “I’m prepared for that.”\n“I’m not sure that I am,” Shae admitted. “You have your children to think of.”\n“I’m thinking of them now. As long as this man breathes, as long as the family’s enemies go\nunpunished, I’ll fear for their lives.” Wen asked, “Do you trust this man that Anden has told us about,\nthis Rohn Toro?”\n“Anden trusts him. And Hilo said that he was the greenest man he met in Port Massy.”"

        "text": "this Rohn Toro?”\n“Anden trusts him. And Hilo said that he was the greenest man he met in Port Massy.”\n“Then he truly is our best hope,” Wen said. “Hilo made the decision to call off the plan without\nconsidering all the options. I’m giving you an option now, a good one. Zapunyo is the reason that\nKehn and Maro are dead, and we’re all still in danger from him. Let me do this, Shae-jen—let me do\nthis for my children, and for the clan.”\nShae felt as if she were staring at herself from somewhere else, unable to discern her own mind.\nHilo was the Pillar, and he’d made his decision. It was her responsibility as Weather Man to follow\nhis wishes. The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its master. But Wen was correct: Hilo did not have\nall the information, and there wasn’t time to go back to him now, to track him down at the hospital\nwhile he was caring for his son, and to explain everything she and Wen had done in the past, things he\nwould never have agreed to but that had been of secret help to the clan at vital times, without which\nhe might not even be Pillar, might not even have a clan at all.\nZapunyo and his barukan allies had maimed the Kaul family; they had killed Maik Kehn and\nnearly killed Wen and the children, including Niko, whom Shae had sworn on her knees to the gods\nshe would protect. They’d done it by going after Maro, by threatening his family and manipulating\nhim into treason. Because of them, Shae had been forced to execute her friend and lover, a good man,\nsomeone gentle at heart who’d truly been the better side of Kekon. The smuggler Zapunyo—like the\nShotarian barukan, like the Espenian Crews—epitomized power without honor, jade without restraint,\nviolence without principle.\nYou lead the clan as much as your brother. Maro had said that to her once, a long time ago, even\nbefore she’d believed it was true and nearly died to prove it. She clung to those words now, molded\nthem into a spear of decisiveness as strong as the resolve she’d once needed to face Ayt Mada with a\nclean blade. She said to Wen, “I’ll have Anden and Rohn meet you at the bus station when you get to\nPort Massy.”\nCHAPTER\n59\nFrom the Kaul Family\nJ\nust under five hours later, Wen sat in the back seat of a gray Brock Parade LS sedan outside the\nCrestwood Hotel in downtown Port Massy. The car was parked in a no-loading zone directly across\nfrom the hotel’s main entrance, but the two police officers standing on nearby street corners did not\nbother them. They were well known to the Dauks as Southtrap beat cops who had reliably taken\nmoney for favors before and were sympathetic to the Kekonese, who rarely dealt drugs or committed\nviolent crimes and took care of their own problems when they occurred. One of the cops was half-\nKekonese himself. They were being handsomely paid to be the first ones to respond to any report of\ndisturbance—and to look the other way while the gray sedan left the scene in a hurry. They were"

They were being handsomely paid to be the first ones to respond to any report of\ndisturbance—and to look the other way while the gray sedan left the scene in a hurry. They were\naware that Zapunyo was staying in the hotel, but what did they care if a foreign jade smuggler known\nfor atrocious human rights violations happened to meet an unfortunate end?\nAnden turned in the front passenger seat to look at Wen with concern. “It’s not too late to change\nour minds,” he insisted. “This is dangerous. Hilo wouldn’t want you involved.”\nWen checked her makeup in a hand mirror, tucking a stray strand of hair back into the knot it had\nescaped from. “We’ve planned this for too long to walk away now, Anden. The Weather Man agrees\nand is counting on us.” She smiled at him reassuringly. “Besides, my part is simple.”\nFrom the driver’s seat, Rohn Toro said, “Remember, just hit the ground and stay there. Don’t get\nup until I say so.” They hadn’t had much time to rehearse, but it would have to do.\nAnden said to Rohn, “Thank you for agreeing to do this.”\n“Thank me after it’s done and we’re safely away,” Rohn said. “Preferably to somewhere warm\nand on another continent.” He got out of the car and opened the trunk. Anden and Wen got out as\nwell. Wen was still amazed by Anden’s changed appearance: He sported a short beard that made him\nlook five years older, bold black glasses frames, a suit cut in a trendy style with thin lapels, and a\nblue-and-white striped tie. He looked the part of a Port Massy urbanite, nothing at all like the earnest\nKaul Du Academy student that she’d known him as back in Janloon. Anden fidgeted with his tie. She\ncould tell from his frequent glances at her that he remained unsure about the decision to bring her in,\nbut he was not about to ruin the plan now by disobeying. She only hoped he would quell any signs of\nunease once they were inside. From the trunk, Rohn Toro took out a professional SLR camera, which\nhe slung around his neck by a leather strap, a camera bag, and a tripod. Wen straightened her skirt,\npicked up her leather folio, and carefully tucked her capped fountain pen into the breast pocket of her\nblazer.\nInside the lobby of the Crestwood, they waited in the cushioned seating area near the bar. One of\nZapunyo’s guards was supposed to meet them, but Uwiwans were never punctual. After thirty\nminutes, Wen began to worry. She saw Anden looking at the clock on the wall, anxious with what she\nsuspected were similar thoughts: Zapunyo had backed out of the interview after all and they would be\nignored or eventually sent away. She couldn’t decide if her disappointment or her relief was greater. If\nthe smuggler escaped back to the Uwiwa Islands, she would continue to spend every day fearing\nanother attack on the family. On the other hand, she had done all she could. Her husband would never\nhave to know how she’d gone against his wishes. Maybe they would eventually find another way to\nget to Zapunyo, just as Hilo had promised her."

Maybe they would eventually find another way to\nget to Zapunyo, just as Hilo had promised her.\nA man came out of the elevators and walked toward them. Wen had never met a barukan in\nperson before, but this man, dressed ostentatiously in a silk shirt and chunky nephrite rings set in\ngold, looked every bit the stereotype. Wen wondered, with wry contempt and curiosity, if perhaps it\nwasn’t the barukan who took their cues from cinema as opposed to the other way around. As he\napproached, Anden stood up. Wen was relieved that he showed no outward sign of nervousness at all,\nspeaking in confidently articulate, if accented Espenian as he shook the barukan man’s hand,\nidentifying himself as the journalist Ray Caido and introducing Rohn Toro and Wen under false\nnames as his photographer and his assistant.\nThe man nodded and led the three of them to the bank of elevators. They ascended to the twelfth\nfloor, where the premium suites were located. There was another barukan waiting in the elevator\nlobby, a younger man. They indicated by spreading their arms that the journalists would be searched\nbefore being allowed to proceed further. They patted Anden and Rohn down for weapons and\nexamined Rohn’s camera equipment. The younger barukan man looked uncomfortable as he stood in\nfront of Wen. Shotarians were a prudish people. Wen held her arms out and the man ran his hands\ndown her sides, back, and legs and stepped away. Wen noticed that the green stones hanging around\nhis neck were nephrite but the studs in his ears were jade. He paused for a moment, Perceiving that\nnone of them possessed jade auras before leading them down the hall to the door of the suite at the\nend. He knocked and they were admitted inside.\nZapunyo was seated in a wide fabric armchair in the center of the suite’s sitting area. Wen was\nstruck by how short he was; he looked almost childlike in the large chair and opulent hotel room. He\nwore a slightly creased tan linen suit with a folded white pocket square that suggested an attempt at\nformality. Wen could see the tops of his puffy veined feet bulging from brown loafers. Surprisingly,\nWen’s first emotion upon finally seeing him in person was pity, almost sympathy. Zapunyo might be a\nrich man with an ambitious and dangerous mind, but he was trapped in a frail body. It was not right\nthat such a man should control jade or challenge Green Bones.\nZapunyo’s eldest son stood near the window behind his father’s chair along with another\nbodyguard, bringing the total number of men to five, three of them barukan.\nAnden said in Espenian, “Mr. Zapunyo, thank you for agreeing to this interview. This is a rare\nopportunity and I feel privileged that you would trust me to share your side of the story. Would you\nprefer that we have our conversation in Espenian or Kekonese? I can speak either.”\nZapunyo wetted his lips. “My Espenian is not so good. Let’s speak in Kekonese.”\n“I promised to take no more than an hour of your time,” Anden said, switching instantly to"

Let’s speak in Kekonese.”\n“I promised to take no more than an hour of your time,” Anden said, switching instantly to\nKekonese and sitting down in the chair across from the smuggler. “While we’re talking, my assistant\nwill be sitting off to the side making notes for me, and the photographer will be taking some pictures.\nYou can ignore them and pretend it’s a conversation between just the two of us.”\nWen smiled and nodded, pulling a chair to the side and sitting down in it. She opened her folio to\nan empty pad of paper and took the thick fountain pen out of her pocket. Near her, Rohn Toro began\nsetting up the camera tripod. Zapunyo glanced at them before turning back.\n“Where are your parents from, Mr. Caido?” the smuggler asked.\nAnden said, “My mother was Kekonese. My father is Espenian.”\n“But you have a Kekonese family name,” Zapunyo said.\n“My parents didn’t stay together; I was raised by my mother.” Anden added, with a hint of\nforced amusement, “Are you planning to interview me, instead of the other way around, sir?”\n“I’m curious about the background of any journalist who is so persistent in requesting a meeting\nwith me,” Zapunyo said. One of his bodyguards placed a glass of sparkling water with a straw on the\nside table next to him. He took it and sipped before speaking again. “Were you born in Kekon or in\nEspenia, Mr. Caido? Why did your parents come to this country?”\n“I was born in Kekon,” Anden said, “but I came to Espenia as a child.” It was the first half-truth\nthat Anden had told, and even though Wen doubted any of the barukan were skilled enough in\nPerception to detect such a minor deception, with each subsequent falsehood, the subtle tension in\nAnden’s body would grow until it became suspicious. Wen uncapped her fountain pen and held it\npoised over the blank pad of paper. She glanced at Rohn Toro, crouched down on the other side of\nZapunyo, snapping photographs.\n“As for why my family came to Espenia,” Anden went on, “I think they believed there was\nopportunity here. They thought I could make a better life for myself in Port Massy, because I was\nborn looking Espenian, and because Kekon was a dangerous place at the time. What about you, Mr.\nZapunyo?” he asked, pivoting the conversation. “How did you get to where you are now?”\n“That is the question we’re all asking ourselves every day, isn’t it, Mr. Caido? How did we get to\nwhere we are now?” Zapunyo smoothed the top of his dark, coarse hair, looking thoughtful. “How is\nit that in my family, there were seven children but only four of us survived, and out of the four of us, I\nwas the one who made it out of the ghetto, who made something of myself even though I was always\nthe smallest and the physically weakest of all the boys?”\nEach of the barukan and Zapunyo’s son were armed with handguns and two of them carried"

Rohn Toro had circled back to where Wen sat. He attached the camera onto the\ntripod. Anden said, “What do you think is the reason, Mr. Zapunyo? Do you believe that perhaps it\nwas your fate, being directed by a higher power such as the gods?”\nZapunyo held up a stumpy finger and his eyes glistened with satisfaction. “I do believe the gods\nhave some say, that is true, but men set their own destinies. For example, who’s to say what brings\nany two people together at a certain time and place for them to change each other’s lives?”\nThe smuggler turned a shrewd look on Anden. “I have many enemies, and naturally, before I\nagreed to meet with you, I had to check your credentials. Mr. Caido indeed works for the Kekon\nJournal and has written many articles and conducted many interviews. But you are not Ray Caido,\nare you?” Zapunyo fished a small black-and-white photograph from the front pocket of his suit and\nheld it up. It appeared to be a yearbook photograph. “You don’t look like him. But you insist on\nmeeting me, unarmed and on my terms, so you’re not here to kill me.”\nWen felt sweat break out on her back. She twisted the barrel of her pen and dropped it. It rolled\noff her lap and onto the floor. Rohn bent to retrieve it for her. Anden didn’t look at them; he sat\ncompletely still and stone-faced, not speaking. Zapunyo, looking smug, said, “Who sent you to seek\nme out? The Mountain clan? Or is it the Kekonese here in Espenia who want jade?”\nWen’s fountain pen broke easily. As Rohn pulled the thin string of tiny jade stones from inside\nthe barrel, Anden leaned forward. “You’re wrong, Zapunyo. I am here to kill you.”\nAll of Zapunyo’s guards drew their guns at the same time, ready to unload a dozen bullets into\nAnden’s body. Two of them began to turn toward Rohn, detecting the sudden flare of a jade aura a\nsplit second before the Green Bone unleashed a Deflection that tore through the small confines of the\nhotel room. It knocked over the camera tripod, sent the water from the glass spraying, and slammed\ninto the men who were standing, shoving them into the walls and furniture.\nGunshots rang out. Wen dropped flat to the ground, ears ringing, heart in her throat. She saw\nAnden throw himself onto Zapunyo, covering the smuggler’s body with his own. As he dragged them\nboth out of the chair and onto the floor, Anden maneuvered behind Zapunyo and wrapped his arms\naround the man’s neck and thin shoulders, pinning him, then rolling over and ducking his own head\nso the smuggler lay struggling with his back on Anden’s chest, trapped as an unwilling shield; the\nbodyguards couldn’t shoot Anden without hitting their boss as well.\nWith her face against the carpet, Wen saw Zapunyo’s son shout, “No, Pap!” His eyes widened"

With a burst of Strength, Rohn Toro flew at him\nand struck him in the throat, crushing his windpipe. As Zapunyo’s son collapsed, Rohn twisted the\ngun from his grip and whipped it up, firing it—one, two, three times. One of the bodyguards went\ndown; another brought up a desperate blast of Steel and Deflection that sent the final bullet into the\nhotel room window. The two remaining barukan returned fire; Rohn dove to the ground and fired\ntwice, blowing out the kneecaps of the nearest man, who screamed as he fell, before Rohn’s next two\nshots silenced him.\nThe final barukan guard raced for the door, firing again at the Green Bone in a panic. In such\nclose quarters, Rohn barely Deflected the shots; one of them tore the fabric of his jacket at the\nshoulder; another bullet embedded itself in the carpet next to Wen. The barukan reached the door and\nyanked the handle. Rohn flew Light across the length of the room and tackled the man, shoving him\nback into the closed door with a crash. They fell to the floor and grappled, Strength against Strength,\nthe sound of thuds and labored breathing reaching Wen even as the two men disappeared from view\nbehind the sofa.\nWen clambered to her hands and knees. There was a gun lying not far from her reach, dropped\nby one of the barukan as he fell. She crawled to it, grasped and lifted it; it was heavy, much heavier\nthan the compact pistols she’d practiced with before. She had to hold it firmly with both hands as she\ngot to her feet.\nRohn and the last guard were still struggling. Rohn had his hands wrapped around his opponent’s\nneck, squeezing and Channeling at the same time until blood began bubbling from the man’s mouth\nas he spasmed and kicked, clawing at Rohn’s Steeled hands. Anden was still on the ground, holding\nZapunyo in a choke hold from behind. The Uwiwan flailed in a continuing effort to get free, but\nphysically he was no match for Anden. Wen walked toward them. She could still hear the barukan’s\ndying gurgles behind her, but she paid them no attention. Zapunyo’s face was red, and his mouth\nworked in astonishment and fear, as if he could not believe that after so many years, and as sick as he\nwas now, someone had gotten to him at last.\n“Let go of him, Anden,” Wen said.\nZapunyo fell choking to the ground. He crawled to his knees and held his hands up, the blood\ndraining from his face at the sight of his dead son and his slain men. “I’m a rich man, a powerful\nman,” he wheezed. “I can pay more than whatever you’ve been offered. Who sent you?”\n“I sent myself,” Wen told him, “from the Kaul family of No Peak.” She pulled the trigger. The\nhandgun bucked in her grip, jolting her wrists.

Taking a lens cloth from the camera bag, he wiped off the grips of the pistols he and Wen\nhad handled and left them lying next to the bodies. The sleeve of his torn jacket was stained with\nblood; he took it off and threw it on the ground as well.\n“Be quick, Rohn-jen,” Anden said. “We need to get out of here.” He crouched over the body of\nthe nearest barukan guard, the younger one who had searched them out in the hallway. He tore the\nstuds from the man’s ears and held them out to Rohn.\n“What are you doing?” Rohn asked.\n“Collecting your jade so we can get out of here faster.”\n“Are you out of your mind?” Rohn said. “Don’t take anything that might link you to the scene of\na murder. If we take the jade off their bodies, it’s a dead giveaway that Green Bones were responsible.\nLeave it. Take only the jade we came in with.” He handed the thin string of jade stones back to Wen,\nwho once again hid it away in the empty barrel of the false fountain pen and pocketed it. For a few\nseconds, Rohn’s face contorted with the discomfort of jade withdrawal. He placed a hand on the back\nof the chair Zapunyo had been sitting in, steadying himself. Then he straightened and went to the\ndoor. Cracking it open, he looked down the hall and said, “Quickly, now.”\nAnden stared at the jade studs in his palm and gave a small start, as if suddenly realizing what he\nwas holding. He dropped them hastily. Wen saw him cast a backward glance around the room as they\nhurried to join Rohn at the door. She wondered if the disbelief on Anden’s face was because of what\nthey’d done, or because it bothered him to be leaving jade behind on the bodies of their enemies,\nsomething no Green Bone in Janloon would ever do.\nThey shut the door behind them and walked quickly down the hall. Perhaps Zapunyo’s guards\nhad taken the precaution of renting out the neighboring rooms as well because no one opened their\ndoors out of curiosity at the commotion. Wen picked up her pace to keep up in her wedge heeled\nshoes. She felt giddy from adrenaline, and even though she was still frightened and her pulse was\nracing, she had to fight the urge to smile. They might yet be caught and thrown into an Espenian\nprison, but she was certain Shae would find a way to get them out. The important thing was that they"

The important thing was that they\nhad done it. She, a stone-eye, had done it. For once, she had not relied on Hilo to mete out the clan’s\njustice, but had delivered it herself. Not even all Green Bones could claim such a thing.\nThey rode the elevator back down to the second floor, then took the stairs down to the main\nlevel. There were people milling about in the lobby, bellmen coming and going, guests checking in or\nout, all of them oblivious to anything that had happened twelve stories above them. Wen suspected\nthe sound of gunfire had been heard and reported, however; behind the check-in counter, two hotel\nstaff were talking in an urgent manner to one of the policemen that had been on the street outside.\nRohn Toro slowed; he picked up a newspaper and tucked it under his arm as he ambled casually\ntoward the main entrance. Wen looped her hand around the crook of Anden’s elbow as if they were a\ncouple heading out for dinner. The two of them followed Rohn at a distance. The policeman did not\nlook at them or give any sign that he noticed them at all. They exited the hotel with no problem and\ngot into the illegally parked sedan. Rohn started the car and pulled away from the curb. As they drove\naway from the Crestwood, he kept glancing in the rearview mirror, but no police lights or sirens\nfollowed them. Wen allowed herself a cautious sigh of relief, but still none of them spoke.\nAs they had planned, Rohn drove fifteen minutes away to Starr Lumber & Supply, the hardware\nstore where Anden used to work. The store had closed an hour ago; the alleyway parking lot behind\nthe strip mall was almost empty except for a black hatchback that Rohn and Anden had left there\nearlier in the day. Rohn parked the Brock nearby. From the rear of the hatchback, Rohn removed a\nduffel bag containing a change of clothes for each of them.\nAnden had an employee key he’d long ago forgotten to return but that he now used to let them in\nthrough the back entrance and into the garage of Starr Lumber. He flicked on the lights; fluorescent\ntubes flickered to life over pallets of recently delivered lumber and boxes of merchandise. Anden let\nout a long breath, his shoulders finally coming down. Wen glanced at the clock on the wall. In a few\nhours, she and Anden would be on a red-eye flight home. “Are you coming to Janloon with us, Rohn-\njen?” she asked.\nRohn shook his head. “I wouldn’t like to be in an unfamiliar place like Janloon with so many\nother Green Bones around,” he said. “I’m going to find myself a warm beach in Alusius instead. I\nhave people I’ve trained here who are green enough, who I trust to keep things in order and help the\nDauks while I’m gone.”\nAnden said, “I’ll call Dauk-jen now and let him know we’re ready to be picked up.

Underneath were fresh shirts\nand pants for Rohn and Anden and in the bag’s side pocket, a pair of black men’s leather gloves.\nRohn gestured for Wen to use the bathroom first; she gathered her items and was about to do so when\nthe door of the garage flung open behind them and six men piled into the room.\nA tall man with a felt hat and a gun stood at the front of the group. “You kecks,” he said, “have\nbeen stepping on the wrong crewboys.”\nWen screamed as he shot Rohn Toro in the legs.\nCHAPTER\n60\nEnd of an Agreement\nS\nhae had not slept the entire night. She’d unplugged the phone in her kitchen, brought it into her\nbedroom, and plugged it in next to her bed, then climbed under the covers and closed her eyes for a\nfew hours, knowing that everything had been set in motion and there was nothing she could do now\nexcept wait for news. Anden was supposed to call as soon as the task was done and he and Wen were\nsafely back with the Dauks and had access to a phone. If everything went according to plan, that\nwould be early in the evening in Port Massy, which was just before sunrise in Janloon. Shae sat two\nbedside clocks next to each other on her windowsill, displaying the local times in both cities, and\nthroughout the night the steady tick of their minute hands seemed as ominous as the countdown timer\non a doomsday device.\nThe tepid glow of dawn began lightening the sky; across the courtyard, the lights in the main\nhouse came on. She saw Kyanla’s figure moving in the kitchen, drawing open the blinds over the\npatio door. Shae’s mother came out of the guesthouse and did her slow stretching exercises in the\ngarden. The phone next to Shae’s bed did not ring. Anden should’ve called by now. Something was\nwrong. Shae sat with her back against the headboard of her bed, knees drawn up, a feeling of dread\ngathering in her chest and spreading into her throat, her limbs and extremities.\n“Get him off the phone,” ordered Skinny Reams, twitching his gun toward where Anden stood in the\noffice. Rohn Toro had collapsed to the ground in agony, but he lunged for the duffel bag and his jade-\nlined gloves. Reams strode forward and kicked the bag out of his reach. Wen pulled the fountain pen\nfrom her pocket, but before she could pass it to Rohn, one of the crewboys seized her from behind\nand lifted her, shouting and struggling, off her feet.\nAnden dialed the last digit of Dauk’s number and grabbed the base of the phone, pivoting behind\nthe half-open office door, out of sight and out of the line of fire. He flattened his back to the wall; the\nrotary spun and clicked. The phone rang on the other end: once, twice. The receiver was shaking in\nhis hands. Hurry, hurry!

The call picked up, and then the phone was smashed out of Anden’s hands\nand went flying. The cord was yanked from the wall. Anden recognized the reddened, freckled face\nright before Carson Sunter punched him in the stomach and then in the face. Anden had forgotten\nhow hard Sunter could punch, but he remembered now. He tasted blood on his tongue as he fell to all\nfours behind the office desk. He searched wildly for something, anything, to use as a weapon and\ngrabbed for a silver letter opener lying on the desk. The butt of a pistol came down on his fingers;\nAnden howled as he felt two of them break. The circle of the weapon’s muzzle pressed against his\ncheekbone. “Didn’t I tell you?” Sunter demanded. “Didn’t I tell you I’d find you and kill you, you\nhalf-keck bastard? Did you think I’d forget?”\n“That’s all over, there was an agreement,” Anden said, mumbling through the pain.\n“You made an agreement with Boss Kromner, but Kromner is locked up, and we don’t work for\nhim anymore. It’s Skinny’s word now and Skinny figures you kecks have been behind all this trouble\nfrom the start.” Sunter seized Anden around the back of the collar and, with the gun still pressed to\nhis head, steered him back out into the garage of the hardware store.\nAnden’s heart was already slamming against his ribs, but now he felt his legs go weak. Rohn\nToro lay on the concrete, blood from his gunshot wounds pooled around him. He’d been kicked and\nbeaten; his eyes and lips were swollen. Skinny Reams and three of his men stood in a circle over him.\n“The demon who can kill five men with his bare hands in less time than it takes to have a piss,”\nWillum Reams said, in a dry tone, almost disappointed. “Turns out you’re made of flesh and blood\nafter all.”\nRohn coughed and winced. “How did you find me, Skinny? Who sold?”\n“The cops at the hotel, of course,” Reams answered. “Told us exactly which car to follow.”\nAnother of his men snorted and added, “You’re amateurs, you kecks. The Crews have been as tight on\nthe PMPD as a pimp on a virgin since before any of your race touched these shores.”\n“What do you want me to do with this one, Skinny?” Sunter asked.\n“Put him over there next to the girl,” Reams said. “Tie them both up.”\nRohn’s blackened eyes caught Anden’s briefly with something near to apology but much closer\nto regret. Wen was kneeling on the ground by the wall, her face drained of color and expression;\nanother one of Reams’s men held a gun over her. As Anden was forced to his knees a couple of\nmeters away, her eyes flicked to him, then to the open duffel bag that had been kicked aside on the\nfloor. The fountain pen that had fallen from her grasp lay nearby.\n“Put your hands behind your back or I’ll shoot you in the kneecaps like your friend,” Sunter"

Anden’s mind ran seemingly in time to the throbbing of his broken fingers. Even as his wrists\nwere tightly bound together, he tried to think of how he might create a distraction, get either the\ngloves or the pen with the hidden jade over to Rohn, possibly give them a chance of survival.\n“Did his phone call get through?” Reams asked his coat. “Is anyone coming?”\n“I didn’t hear him talking to anyone, but I can’t say for sure,” said Sunter.\n“Skinny.” Rohn spoke from the floor, his voice strained with pain, but calmly, urgently\nreasonable. Perhaps he thought he could talk his way out of the situation, reach his jade somehow, or\nat the very least, delay what was coming. “We’ve known each other since way back. We grew up\npractically around the corner from each other in Southtrap. We’ve been on different sides before, but\nthe two of us, we’ve always worked things out between our bosses.”\n“That is true,” said Reams. “We were good foremen, weren’t we?”\n“We can still work things out,” Rohn said. His face had gone chalky, and his pants were soaked\nwith blood. “Kromner was greedy, he got rich and fat, but you’re practical, Skinny, you always have\nbeen. You’re Boss of your own Crew now. Why make enemies instead of friends?”\nSkinny Reams took off his felt hat and turned it around and around in his hands. “You make a\ngood point, Rohn, but I’ll tell you why,” he said, as solemnly as a schoolteacher at a lectern. “Because\nI don’t like you kecks at all. Everything was going fine before Boss Kromner got it into his head to\nget involved with you people over jade. I don’t care how much they’re worth, those rocks aren’t\nnatural. They don’t belong here, and neither do you. Since I’m the new Boss in these parts, I have to\nmake it clear that I differ from Kromner on this point. So it’s got to be this way.”\nReams’s biggest, strongest-looking man produced a white plastic bag and double loop of cord.\nRohn knew what came next; he surged upward, away from his executioner, toward the duffel bag\nwith his jade gloves. Blood loss, the bullets in his legs, and the two other men who grabbed his arms\nensured that he did not get far; the bag went over Rohn’s head and the cord around his neck.\nAnden lunged forward with a shout of sheer desperation but could do nothing with his arms tied\nbehind his back; Sunter eagerly kicked him to the ground and put a boot in the small of his back. His\nglasses were knocked off his face and went skittering across the floor. The other guard took a cloth\nrag from the hook on the wall near the garage cleaning supplies and jammed it into Anden’s mouth,\nmuffling his cries. He gagged on the taste of grease and cleaning fluid, felt the corners of his mouth\nburning as the fabric was pulled tight.\nRohn Toro fought like an ox.

He twisted and\ntried to slacken the pressure on his windpipe, but injured and without jade, in seconds his movements\nbegan to weaken. Reams’s coat continued tightening the garrote with the impassive deliberation of a\npiano tuner. From where he was pinned with his face against the cold concrete, Anden watched the\nmost formidable Green Bone in Port Massy, the man who’d defended the grudge hall from machine\ngun fire and single-handedly taken out a room full of barukan, grow feeble, his legs beating against\nthe floor, the plastic clinging to his face cutting off what little air remained to him. A stench rose from\nhis body as his bowels gave out in the last few seconds of his life. The executioner stepped away; the\nplastic did not flutter against Rohn’s open mouth.\nReams touched the tip of his forefinger to the center of his brow and raised it in the sign of the\nOne Truth. “God uplift his soul,” he muttered. His men followed suit obediently.\nThe garroter stepped away from Rohn’s body and toward Wen and Anden. “Do we have to kill\nthe peach, Boss?” Sunter asked, looking at Wen. “She’s pretty; couldn’t we just—”\nReams gave his coat a sternly disappointed look and Sunter stopped talking. Anden’s vision was\nblurred and he thought his heart might pound itself to death before the crewboys killed him. When\nWen turned her head to catch his eyes, he tried to speak but the gag was still in his mouth and he\ncould only look at her in mute panic. He thought she made an attempt to smile at him, as if in\nsolidarity, telling him to be brave, that at least they were facing this together.\nWen turned to Reams and tilted her chin to stare up into his face. “Do you know who I am?” she\nasked in accented Espenian. Her hands were clasped together tightly and it was clear she was\nfrightened, but her voice was shockingly calm. “Do you know the name Kaul? Or the name Maik?”\nReams looked down at her with dispassion. “Sorry, peach. Who you are doesn’t matter to me. If\nyou’re important among your own people, then so much the better for my purposes.”\nWen spat at Reams’s feet. She straightened and spoke in Kekonese. “The clan is my blood, and\nthe Pillar is its master.” The man with the garrote stepped behind Wen and slipped the plastic bag over\nher head. He looped the cord around her neck and began to tighten it. Wen did not struggle. She had\nseen Rohn Toro—a man, much larger and stronger than her—beaten into submission and murdered\nbefore her eyes and saw no point in repeating the indignity. Wen’s face remained turned slightly\nupward, and she kept reciting the single line, over and over again, until she had no access to air and\nonly her mouth was moving. The clan is my blood, and the Pillar…\nWen’s legs kicked, stiffened, went limp.\nAnden was screaming endlessly around the gag in his mouth; his mind was filled with nothing\nbut the sound of his own screaming and when the bag went over his head and the cord around his"

He was sobbing with impotent,\nburning, grief-stricken rage, cursing their killers with every ounce of vitriol in his being. He couldn’t\nbelieve he was going to die in such a low way at the hands of such scum, helpless, here of all places\n—on the floor of a garage in fucking Espenia. His vision went red, then white.\nShae took out her address book, picked up the phone, and told the operator that she needed to place a\nlong-distance call to Port Massy. The number that Anden had given her for his apartment rang without\nresponse. She had been advised not to use the number for the Dauks’ residence, as it was possible that\nthe Espenian authorities might still be monitoring it, but she called it anyway; there was no answer\nthere either. Her final attempt was the Weather Man’s branch office, just in case for some reason\nAnden had gone there, but as expected, it was closed for the evening. Shae depressed the receiver\ncradle, then released it and called her own office to tell her secretary that she would not be coming\ninto work this morning and to cancel her appointments.\nShe thought about the small prayer room in the main house, but she didn’t dare to leave earshot\nof her phone. She placed three sticks of incense in a cup, set it by her window, and knelt. Thin tendrils\nof fragrant sandalwood smoke rose and mingled against the glass. Shae touched her forehead to the\nground three times and whispered, “Yatto, Father of All. Jenshu, Old Uncle. Gods in Heaven, please\nhear me. My cousin, Emery Anden, was adopted into our family and raised as my youngest brother.\nHe could’ve been a powerful Green Bone but he refuses to wear jade because he didn’t want a life of\nkilling and madness. My sister-in-law, Kaul Maik Wen, is a stone-eye but she’s never let that stop her;\nshe’s risked her life and her marriage for the clan, and she’s the mother of three small children who\nneed her. Anden and Wen are green in the soul, and now they’re in danger in Espenia because I put\nthem both there. Please protect them and bring them home safely.”\nThe silence that followed her words was so absolute that her growing panic spiked into anger.\n“Why are you always so cruel?” she demanded in a harsh whisper. “Every week, I come to you on\nmy knees. If you even exist, then help us. We’re not a family that can claim to adhere to the Divine\nVirtues all the time, but who can? Who in our position could stand a chance? Please, I’m begging\nyou, don’t punish Wen and Anden for anything my brother or I have done in the past.” Shae felt her\nhands trembling against her thighs. “On my honor, my life, and my jade—I’m begging you.”\nAnden didn’t hear the noises at first. When he did, he didn’t identify them as the crunch of tires and\nthe slamming of car doors. The one thing he heard was Carson Sunter exclaim, “Shit, they’re here.”"

The one thing he heard was Carson Sunter exclaim, “Shit, they’re here.”\nHe heard that part clearly—and then Reams’s sharp order: “Out the front.”\nThe circle of pressure around Anden’s neck abruptly slackened and he was dropped to the\nground on his stomach, the pain in his throat and chest so bad it felt like fire inside his lungs.\nA great deal more noise erupted—gunshots and shouting, running feet, more gunshots\nreverberating in the enclosed space—he had no idea where they were coming from or how many\nthere were, and then crashing sounds farther away in the front of the store. He couldn’t see anything\nexcept shadow and movement through the film of white plastic over his face, which was still\nsuffocating him. He was fading out, his consciousness sliding away like hot oil.\nHands seized him and rolled him over roughly; the plastic was torn off his face. Air flooded into\nAnden’s nose and mouth and he gasped violently, blinking and heaving for breath. Shun Todorho\nknelt over him, his face ashen and horrified. He had a gun in his hand, but he set it down and worked\nat removing Anden’s gag. Anden coughed and spat, the corners of his mouth raw and stinging.\nSomeone else—Sammy—cut the bindings around Anden’s wrists, and they sat him up, steadying\nhim. Three other Green Bones that Anden recognized from the grudge hall were crowded into the\ngarage. “The phone call was cut off—we thought we were too late,” Tod said.\n“We were,” Sammy said, turning to where Dauk Losun knelt beside Rohn Toro’s body. The\nPillar of Southtrap rocked back on his heels, tears running freely down his rough face.\nAnden shot to his feet, swayed, and stumbled to where Wen lay motionless on the concrete. He\ntore the bag off her face and pressed his ear to her chest, praying he would hear a heartbeat. He had\nlearned basic first aid at some point in his life, and he struggled to remember what to do if a person\nwas not breathing. He tilted Wen’s head back and opened her mouth, sealing it with his own, and\nbreathed out in two hard puffs. He began doing chest compressions. How much time had passed? It\ncouldn’t have been more than a few minutes… perhaps… He breathed into her mouth again.\n“Please,” he begged all the gods, “please.”\nWen remained limp.\nSammy crouched down beside Anden and put a hand on his shoulder. “She’s gone, crumb,” he\nsaid. Anden stopped in midmotion. In desperate epiphany, he whirled, his eyes wild, and scrambled to\nthe duffel bag still lying open on the floor, out of reach the whole time that Rohn Toro had needed it\nmost. Anden grabbed Rohn’s black gloves and hurried back to Wen; before anyone could even ask\nhim what he was doing, he shoved his hands into the jade-studded lining.\nSharp, physical pain radiated from his broken fingers all the way up his arm and he whimpered,\nclutching his wrist, curling his body around his injury and bracing impatiently for the more profound\npain to come.

It had been so long since he had worn jade that he expected the rush to arrive like a\nsledgehammer, and he readied himself. In his mind, he coiled, the way a man might crouch, arms\nextended, balanced on the balls of his feet, optimistically hoping to catch a boulder hurled in his\ndirection. Anden breathed in, then out, and for the second time in his life, sensation and awareness\nengulfed him in a maelstrom of energy. It was not as much jade as he’d once handled in the final\nbattle against Gont Asch, but it was still enough to make his skull feel as if it were being blasted\napart. He threw his head back, mouth open and gasping, but he did not cringe from the onslaught;\nthrough it all he was aware of the passage of time. Every second he took to adjust to the jade rush,\nevery instant of delay, was one he could not afford.\nHe had only one chance, and it was now.\nWith a wrenching force of will, he grasped the jade energy with skills that were ill-used but not\nforgotten. He bent the flow of energy to his will; he pulled it into a single focus. His eyes were closed,\nbut he could sense the presence of the people around him, breathing, pulsing, living creatures, and he\nignored them all. He concentrated only on the form beneath him, the body that had been alive only a\nfew minutes ago—and he saw it for what it was—an organism that had once throbbed with energy but\nin which the current was now stilled and rapidly draining.\nAnden pressed his clenched fists down over Wen’s chest and Channeled. The energy surged into\nWen’s heart and lungs. Anden hung on to it the way one might with shaking arms control the shaft of\na thrust spear. With his jade abilities straining to their utmost, he squeezed.\nWen’s heart convulsed in his grasp. It gave a juddering spasm and beat once, twice, and then\ncontinued to beat, forcing blood through vessels and organs, back into her brain. Anden’s entire body\ntrembled with unbearable effort; sweat bathed his face as he continued to press. Wen’s lungs\ncontracted. She gave a great, heaving gasp, her back arching on the floor. Her eyes flew open.\nAnden released his hold on her, turned away, and vomited. His hands were shaking too badly for\nhim to remove the gloves; he tugged them off with his teeth and let them fall to the ground. Wen\nstared up at him in abject confusion and pain, and then tears sprang into her eyes.\nJade energy crashed out of Anden like a weight dragging him through his own body toward the\ncenter of the earth. He was utterly drained, exhausted and empty, as if he’d run for days or crawled\nthrough a desert. He pulled Wen into his lap and began to sob, and she clutched him and they rocked\ntogether on the floor of the garage, only dimly aware of Dauk Losun and the other Green Bones of\nSouthtrap standing around them, staring and silent with astonishment.\nCHAPTER\n61\nLines Crossed\nS\nhae scrambled across the floor of her bedroom and grabbed up the receiver as soon as the phone"

Anden’s voice, dampened by the long-distance connection, sent her sagging against the bed in\nrelief at first, but he sounded so strange that her alarm surged again. “Shae-jen,” he said, “sorry I\ndidn’t call you on time. It’s done, it worked as we planned, but we were ambushed afterward, and…\nthe Crews…” Anden’s voice caught audibly in his throat. “Rohn Toro is dead.”\n“Are you and Wen all right?” Shae demanded.\nA pause. Her cousin was breathing hard. “I’m not sure yet,” he said, almost too quietly for her to\nhear, even with the phone pressed hard against her ear. “If I give you a number, can you call me back?\nI’m on the pay phone at the hospital and running out of coins; I think this call is going to cut out\nsoon.”\nAfter Shae returned Anden’s call, he told her what had happened, with enough faltering\nthroughout that she could tell he was still in shock and having difficulty grappling with his emotions.\n“How will we tell Hilo?” he cried. Shae told him not to worry about that, she would handle it, and to\ncall her again in two hours so she would know he’d made it safely home.\nShae was reeling when she hung up. She took several minutes to compose herself, then placed\nyet another long-distance call to the personal residence of Hami Tumashon, catching him before he\nwent to bed and instructing him to go to the hospital at once and spare no effort on the part of the\nWeather Man’s branch office to make all the urgent and necessary arrangements.\nShae dressed and walked across the courtyard to the main house. In the kitchen, Kyanla was\nsitting at the kitchen table, coaxing Jaya to eat from a bowl of porridge. The toddler banged her fists\non the high chair and flung a spoon onto the ground. “Where’s Hilo?” Shae asked.\nThe housekeeper’s brows rose in worry at the tone of Shae’s voice. “The Pillar is in the training\nhall, I think. Is everything all right, Shae-se? Are you not going into the office today?”\nOutside the training hall, Shae paused and leaned her forehead against the door. Her dread was\nworse than it had been in the cabin with Doru, worse than standing across from Ayt Madashi,\nknowing she might die. She could Perceive her brother’s aura and her nephew’s small presence and\nshe hesitated, reluctant to take the next step, to ruin the moment, to destroy everything.\nShe slid open the door. Hilo and Niko were sitting on the floor playing Blind Miner, a game that\nShae recognized immediately, one that every Green Bone family played with their children. A piece\nof cloth was spread on the floor; it covered a dozen small rocks, only one of which was a piece of\njade. Niko was feeling the cloth and the hard objects underneath.

He tapped one of them and Hilo\nwhisked the cloth away and grinned. “Another point for you.” It was a silly, simple game to pass the\ntime, but it was also a way to expose children to jade and begin to attune them to its physical effects.\nWhich one makes you feel good when you touch it—a little warm, a little tingly?\nNiko looked up and said, “Do you want to play, Auntie Shae?”\n“No, Niko-se, not right now,” Shae said. “I need to talk to your uncle.”\nHilo scooped up the rocks and the single piece of jade, depositing them into a cloth bag with a\ndrawstring and putting them into a drawer. “Go play outside,” he told Niko. “I’ll let you and your\nbrother watch television later.” The boy ran off and Hilo turned to his Weather Man.\n“How’s Ru?” Shae asked.\n“He’s still sleeping. We didn’t get home until past midnight last night.” Shae already knew this\nbecause she’d still been wide awake at that time and had seen the lights of the Duchesse come up the\ndriveway. “He’s groggy from being put under and his throat’s sore, but he’ll be fine.” Hilo looked as\nif he would say more, but instead his eyes narrowed and his chin tilted to the side; Shae knew there\nwas no way he could fail to Perceive the roiling agitation of her aura.\n“What is it, Shae?” he asked.\n“Zapunyo’s dead,” Shae said. “After I spoke with you yesterday, Wen phoned me from Adamont\nCapita. We decided to go ahead with the plan, because we might not get another chance. Wen carried\nthe jade into the room. She, Anden, and Rohn Toro—they killed Zapunyo and his guards—but they\nwere ambushed afterward. Anden and Wen are alive, but they’re in the hospital.”\nAfterward, Shae couldn’t recall how much and what else she told him, she couldn’t even\nremember if she explained it all calmly, or if she stammered and struggled. What she remembered\nlater was the contrast: the way Hilo’s face grew wooden, as if each muscle was locking into place,\nwhile his aura built in heat and intensity, began to roil and heave, bubble, smoke, and burn, as if it\nwere subsuming her brother’s physical energy, turning him into a statue even as he swelled in her\nPerception to a bonfire.\nShe remembered, strangely, that for years she used to take a secret cruel pleasure in angering\nHilo. As children and even as teens and into their adulthood, she’d always been able to provoke him\nand inwardly smirk at the spectacle he could make of himself. She was ashamed of herself now, for\nall the times she had done that.\nShe kept speaking, as if facts could dull reality. “Anden’s hurt and in shock, but he’ll recover.\nThey’re not sure about Wen yet. It depends on how long her brain was without oxygen. The Espenian\ndoctors are running tests, and once she’s back in Janloon—”\nHilo crossed the space between them in a heartbeat and struck her across the face. Shae reacted"

        "text": "doctors are running tests, and once she’s back in Janloon—”\nHilo crossed the space between them in a heartbeat and struck her across the face. Shae reacted\nwith instinctive Steel, but even so, the Strength of the blow crumpled her to her knees. She put a hand\nto her cheek, blinking at the pain. Her head felt as if it were vibrating on her spine like a beaten gong.\nShe Perceived rather than saw Hilo about to hit her again, his eyes alight with insensible fury, and she\nthrew a reflexive Deflection that sent him staggering backward.\nShae got to her feet. She didn’t think she could talk; her face was throbbing and felt frozen. She\ntried anyway; “Hilo—” but her brother launched himself at her with an inarticulate noise. His enraged\nblows fell on her Steeled arms and shuddered through her frame; their jade auras crashed against each\nother, shrill and explosive, rippling and grappling like tangled, sparking wires.\n“How could you?” Hilo might have whispered the words; he might have screamed them—Shae\nwas not sure. She could only feel the force with which they landed, harder than his fists. “How could\nyou?”\nShae staggered from his maddened blows. In desperation, she planted a thrust kick in her\nbrother’s stomach, following it up with another Deflection that flung Hilo into the training room’s\ncabinets. The force of the impact snapped hinges and buckled the wood. Hilo shook his head, dazed,\nbut was on his feet again in a second, and Shae was suddenly afraid—not of Hilo, but of what might\nhave to happen: One of them would have to beat the other unconscious for this to end—but then the\ndoor of the room slid open partway with a rasp. Ru and Niko stood peering inside, their eyes wide,\nmouths open in confusion and astonishment. “Da?” Ru ventured.\nHilo spun toward his sons, his face contorted. “Get out!”\nThe boys were so stunned at their father’s sudden and inexplicable wrath that they froze like\nrabbits. Ru’s mouth trembled, then he turned and ran toward the main house, crying. Niko ran in the\nother direction, into the room and to Shae, grabbing her tightly around the waist and burying his face\nagainst her stomach as if to hide. She put her arms around him without thinking.\nSomething in Hilo’s expression shifted and collapsed like a crumbling tower; he sagged and slid\nto the ground, his back against the broken cabinets. He put his face in his hands.\n“Go back to the house with your brother,” Shae whispered to Niko, her voice strained but as\nreassuring as she could make it. She rubbed his back. “Your uncle and I are training and can’t be\ninterrupted right now. He’s not angry at you, I promise. We’ll be out soon.” Gently, she loosened the\nboy’s arms. Niko glanced uncertainly at Hilo, wanting to go to him, but his uncle, who was usually so\nquick to smile and roughhouse with him, neither looked up nor made any move to rise from his spot\non the floor. Reluctantly, the boy shuffled out of the room. Shae closed the door quietly behind him\nand turned slowly back around."

Shae closed the door quietly behind him\nand turned slowly back around.\nHilo lifted his face from his hands and stared up at her, and she was startled to see tears in his\neyes. “You once asked me if I trusted you, do you remember?”\n“You said that you didn’t have a choice,” Shae said.\n“I didn’t,” Hilo agreed. “Even though I knew all along that you never wanted to be in the clan,\nnever wanted to be a Kaul, never really wanted me as a brother either.” His voice deadened, turned\ncold and remote. She’d seen it happen before: the explosion of fury and hurt, then the rejection, the\npulling away. “Get out,” he said. “You’re not my Weather Man, not anymore. You’re free, Shae, like\nyou always wanted.”\nShae put a hand on the door of the training room. For a second, she imagined obeying her\nbrother—sliding the door open and stepping out, returning to her house and packing a few items,\nwalking down the long driveway and through the iron gates of the estate her grandfather had built, not\nlooking back. She had done such a thing once before, years ago. She’d been a different person back\nthen. A young woman who’d not yet lived abroad, suffered heartbreak and terrible loss, or wielded\npower over clan and country. She had not yet fought and nearly died in a duel of clean blades, taken\nlives out of vengeance and one out of mercy, or rocked her niece and nephews to sleep in her arms.\nShe could not have imagined such things, not back then.\nShe took several steps toward her brother. “I’m not leaving, Hilo.” She spoke unsteadily, but\nwith no uncertainty. “I’ve given as much for No Peak as you have. I’ve worked and sacrificed and\nbled and killed. After everything we’ve been through, how can you believe that I don’t care every bit\nas much as you do? I’m guilty of having gone against you, but never against the clan.”\n“Now you sound like Doru.” Hilo’s mouth moved in a half-hearted sneer when he saw how his\nwords cut her. He leaned his head back against the cabinets with a light thud. He appeared bitterly\ndefeated all of a sudden, in a way that she had never seen him, not even in their most dire moments\nwhen it seemed their enemies would destroy them. “Maybe I don’t believe in the gods like you do,\nbut I do know that some things are the way they are for a reason. We’re Kauls. We were born for this\nlife, whether we like it or not. The clan can claim everything I have—my time, my blood and sweat,\nmy life and jade—but it can’t have my wife. She’s a stone-eye. She’s the one thing in the world that\njade can’t touch. You knew that was a line I would never cross.”\nShae glanced the way Niko had gone. “We’ve both crossed lines we never meant to. We’ve made\ndecisions that we’ll have to live with the rest of our lives. We have that much in common.” She\ntouched her face gingerly; her jaw still felt numb and it hurt to talk.

She came to me\nyears ago, Hilo. All you wanted was for her to stay out of clan affairs, and all she wanted was in. She\nknew you’d never approve, but she’s too green at heart and was willing to risk even your love.\nWithout her, we wouldn’t have established jade sales to the Espenians when we most needed it during\nthe war with the Mountain, we wouldn’t have gained valuable information from the spies she\nmanaged, or transported jade to the Green Bones in Espenia and created our alliances there. We\nwouldn’t have been able to get to Zapunyo and kill him.”\nShae lowered herself to the ground next to her brother and rested her bruised back against the\nsplintered cabinet. “Hate me from now on if you have to, but you need me to stay, Hilo. And you need\nWen and Anden. You said it yourself years ago: We have each other, and maybe that’s the one thing\nwe have that our enemies don’t.” Hilo’s aura gave a dark pulse, like an angry sigh, but he didn’t move\nor open his eyes. Shae slumped back and closed her own eyes. “The clan is my blood and the Pillar is\nits master,” she whispered. “I have a lot of regrets in life, but those oaths aren’t one of them.”\nCHAPTER\n62\nStill at War\nS\nhae had been sitting in the sanctum of the Temple of Divine Return for some time when she\nPerceived the unexpected presence of Ayt Madashi’s dense, molten jade aura pierce the fog of her\nthoughts, intensifying like a heat source against her closed eyes as it approached. Ayt knelt on the\ngreen cushion next to her. “I’m told that you visit the temple every week at the same time,” she said,\nconversationally. “Unwise from a security standpoint.”\nA sense of oddly poignant déjà vu kept Shae motionless for a moment. She imagined reaching\nback in time with her mind and looking down at herself nearly five years ago, meeting Ayt Mada in\nthis same place, unsure of whether she or her clan would survive the encounter. She felt no fear this\ntime, though the puckered scar across her abdomen prickled. She opened her eyes, and for a second,\nher gaze slid involuntarily to Ayt’s bare arms. The coils of silver encircling them were more densely\nset with jade stones—jade that had once been part of Shae’s two-tier choker.\nShe raised her eyes calmly to Ayt’s face. “You’ve had your chances to kill me.”\n“True,” Ayt agreed. “We’ll both know when the real time comes.” The Pillar of the Mountain\nwas as formidable a presence as ever, but a few fine lines were visible around her eyes as she turned\nthem on the younger woman. Over the past years, with all her public speeches and television\nappearances, she had taken to wearing some makeup. Shae was all of a sudden self-conscious of her\nown appearance; her face was still visibly bruised from where Hilo had struck her.\nShe brought her gaze back to the front, to the mural of Banishment and Return and the circle of"

Do you even believe in the gods, Ayt-jen?”\n“I believe in them,” Ayt said, “but I don’t need to explain myself to them. When I was eight\nyears old, they destroyed my town and killed my family and everyone I cared for. In the orphanage, I\nwas told that it wasn’t the gods that caused the landslide; it was the Shotarians and their bombs.\nWhich goes to show that the gods don’t determine fate. People do. Powerful people.” Ayt gazed\nimpassively at the penitents, who were, it was believed, carrying all their words to the ears of the\ngods in Heaven. “I’ve never killed or ordered someone to be killed out of anger or a desire for\npersonal vengeance. When I’ve taken lives, it’s been out of necessity, for the ultimate good of the clan\nand the country. Can you say the same for yourself and your family, Kaul Shae-jen?”\nShae wondered if perhaps Ayt resented her in some way—if, beyond her simple ambition to see\nthe Mountain prevail over No Peak, she harbored an ongoing desire to punish Shae specifically. The\nlast time they’d met in this temple, Shae had spurned Ayt’s fratricidal offer that they rule together\nunder one clan, and chosen instead that they should struggle against each other at every turn. She’d\noffered Ayt a clean blade, and by all rights, she should be dead, yet here she sat.\n“I congratulate you on assassinating Zapunyo,” Ayt said, not expecting or waiting for Shae to\nanswer the rhetorical question. “Perhaps you acted out of retribution, but you acted correctly for us\nall. Zapunyo was a blight on the world—an untrained foreigner, an Uwiwan—selling our jade to other\nforeign criminals. As Kekonese, as Green Bones, we can agree that he had to die. Zapunyo’s sons are\ndead as well. Iyilo and the rest of the barukan saw to it that same night.”\nThe casualness with which she said this shifted something in Shae’s mind. Suspicions revolved\nand fell neatly into place. “You were collaborating with them the whole time.”\nAyt said, “Your brother wanted to destroy the enterprise that Zapunyo had built. I wanted to take\nit. You and I came to the same conclusion, Kaul-jen: If we hope to extend our influence beyond the\nborders of our island nation, we need allies abroad. Allies with jade. Iyilo leads the barukan in the\nUwiwas and has influential friends back in Shotar. They now control Zapunyo’s estate and all his\nconsiderable assets.”\n“Which means that you control them,” Shae amended. “What did you pay to the half bones in\norder to secure their allegiance?” She made a noise of understanding before Ayt could answer. “Of\ncourse. The passing of the Oortokon Conflict Refugee Act. You whispered Chancellor Son’s name to\nensure that the vote in the Royal Council would go your way.”"

        "text": "course. The passing of the Oortokon Conflict Refugee Act. You whispered Chancellor Son’s name to\nensure that the vote in the Royal Council would go your way.”\n“We think of them as petty gangsters, but the barukan are human beings as much as any of us.\nThey want to get their families out of war-torn Oortoko.” Ayt brushed a stray bit of lint from her\nsmooth black slacks. “The Royal Council has voted to allow seven thousand Shotarians of Kekonese\nancestry to immigrate to our country. Opponents of the Refugee Act have argued that it would be a\nsecurity concern and a costly burden on the government. Fortunately, Green Bones will come to the\naid of the country, as we have in the past.”\nAyt’s smile was cold and satisfied, the expression of a snake that has successfully swallowed a\ngreat meal. “Lawyers in my Weather Man’s office have already been clearing the way in anticipation\nof this important legislation. The Mountain clan will be reviewing applications and sponsoring\nrefugees, helping them to find new homes, gainful employment, and a place in our society. We’ll\nteach them to leave behind their foreign customs, to learn our ways and integrate into Kekonese\nsociety—including accepting the authority of the clan.”\nShae nodded. Up to seven thousand additional sworn members of the Mountain clan, selected\nand brought in by Ayt and her people. New barukan Fingers who already wore jade, who\nromanticized the Green Bone way of life, who had strong connections to the black market jade trade\nand other criminal enterprises throughout Shotar, the Uwiwa Islands, Ygutan, and the rest of the\nregion. The Mountain had been busy. While No Peak had been growing its international businesses,\nstrengthening relationships with the Espenian government and the Green Bone community in Port\nMassy, Ayt had been building a base of power closer to home.\n“You’ve always had visionary strategies, Ayt-jen,” Shae said, not attempting to hide the grudging\nadmiration in her voice, “but do you really believe you can control the barukan you’re bringing in?\nThey might wear jade, but they’re not Green Bones; they weren’t trained at Wie Lon or the Academy,\nnor raised with aisho. The local criminals you supported years ago, the ones you used as informers in\nNo Peak territory and then cast off—they turned into a social rot in Janloon, one that the barukan\nthemselves took advantage of in order to steal jade from our shores.”\nPerhaps she and Ayt Mada had something else in common, Shae thought—the arrogance to\nrationalize their own worst ideas, to commit to a course of action out of pride without truly\nunderstanding the possibility of disaster. “You claim to be a patriot, a protector of Kekon and our way\nof life. But you’re willing to bargain it all for your own gain. You’re willing to ally with anyone who\ngets you closer to your ultimate goal. Even if you achieve it, even if the Mountain comes to rule all of\nKekon, it won’t be the Kekon we recognize. If you have your way, being a Green Bone will mean\nnothing.”\nAyt appeared to consider Shae’s words. “It will mean something different, something even more\npowerful than before.

Change is inevitable, Kaul-jen; the only question is whether we control its\ndirection or become victims of a landslide. There will always be people who resist, who try to drag us\nbackward. People like Ven Sandolan, who believed that family pedigree and wealth meant he was\nuntouchable.” Ayt’s dense jade aura emanated the deep heat of old coals. “Now that Ven and his heirs\nare dead, K-Star Freight has been acquired by an Ygutanian transportation conglomerate that has\nmade assurances that K-Star will continue to be run independently in Kekon. We’re all biased against\nforeigners, but the world is opening up more each day, and I’ll take foreign allies over Green Bones\nwho insist on standing in the way.”\nShae said, “Did you seek me out here in the temple just to gloat, Ayt-jen?”\nFor the first time in their conversation, Ayt showed irritation. “I want to make it clear that even\nafter all these years, No Peak remains in the weaker position. You’ve expanded your own businesses\nand cultivated your own allies, but the Mountain once again possesses more people and greater\nresources. Both of our clans have interests spread well beyond our borders; we have international\nnetworks and stakeholders. We’re past the point we were at five years ago, when one of us might have\nwon the war in the streets and conquered the other through superior exercise of violence.”\nShae said nothing, knowing that what Ayt said was true. The Pillar said, “Surely you’ve seen the\nnews that an armistice has been declared in Oortoko. The western half will be governed by Shotar and\nan independent eastern state will fall under the ‘protection’ of Ygutan. Nearly four years of conflict\nand gods know how much money and lives spent by both sides, and the result is exactly what anyone\ncould’ve foreseen when two powers of equal determination clash.” Ayt shifted on her cushion to face\nShae more directly. Shae saw up close, for the first time, the woman’s left ear, the top third of it\ncleanly sliced away. A permanent disfigurement that was ambiguously a mark of atonement or a\nbadge of combat. Either way, Ayt wore it without shame, making no effort to hide it.\n“We sat in front of the cameras in the General Star Hotel knowing the peace we were declaring\nbetween our clans was a temporary measure based on necessity,” Ayt said. “Now the foreign proxy\nwar is over but the necessity is no less. The military tension between Espenia and Ygutan continues\nunabated. The Oortokon War might’ve been an unfortunate thing for the world, but it has benefited\nthe Kekonese economy and our importance in the world. The foreigners still want our jade—but now\nalso our goods, our money, and our influence.\n“So let this moment be one of true agreement between us, Kaul Shae-jen. Our own private\narmistice. We both tried to win the war covertly by manipulating agents. They failed, which only goes\nto show that outsiders are not reliable when it comes to Green Bone matters.

I’ve whispered Kaul\nHilo’s name enough for it to have become a predictable habit, and I tire of the game. In Oortoko, the\nglobal powers came to the realization that they had to check their feud or risk dragging the entire\nworld into another Many Nations War. Your brother may not be able to think in such broad terms, but\nyou can. Prevail upon his better judgment, as limited as that might be. There are small children in\nyour family now, and I imagine you don’t want them to lose any more fathers or uncles.” Ayt’s voice\ntook a softly menacing turn. “If you move against me again, or simply fail to keep Kaul Hilo’s\nvengeful nature in check, then remember that Ven Sando was the patriarch of an old and powerful\nGreen Bone line, one that should’ve thrived for generations to come, but because of his treachery, he\nlost everything: his business accomplishments, the lives of his loved ones, the very existence and\nlegacy of his family name and bloodline. It could happen to anyone.”\nYes, Shae thought. Even you. Ayt had not come by her victory unscathed. She’d been\nbeleaguered by fractiousness within her clan—fractiousness abetted by No Peak at every turn. She’d\nsold the Mountain’s largest company to foreign interests, made allies of the criminal barukan, broken\naisho by murdering Chancellor Son, and stained her hands with the blood of her own Green Bones yet\nagain. She’d been forced to recognize the claim of an unproven twelve-year-old boy and elevate the\nundistinguished Koben family into a position of power she had never intended to share. Shae\nsuspected that for all of Ayt’s smugness over her renewed position of strength over No Peak, she had\nnot wanted to do any of these things.\nShae felt, in that moment, a curious empathy for her mortal enemy. What Ayt had said to her was\ncorrect: No one was untouchable. She felt the other woman’s aura pressing against her like an\nexpanding solid surface. She remembered the critical moment in their duel when their energies had\ngrappled, neither able to overcome the other, and the sense of elation she’d felt when she’d\nsucceeded, for an instant, to bring her rival to a standstill. She’d done so again. Ayt would not be\nthreatening her if she did not on some level, even with all her considerable victories, fear the fact that\nthe Kaul family was still alive. Damaged, yes—but alive, and growing, with its own allies, resources,\nand implacable vengefulness. As surely as the division between East and West Oortoko would fester\nlike an infected scar, the history of violence between No Peak and the Mountain meant that in the\nend, one of them was bound to prevail, perhaps by the finality of the blade, perhaps by other means.\nShae bent at the waist and touched her forehead to the ground in front of the cushion. “Yatto,\nFather of All,” she said, “I beg you recognize all the Green Bones who came before us, especially my\ngrandfather Kaul Seningtun and his comrade Ayt Yugontin, and all the jade warriors who’ve fought\nfor Kekon while striving to be true to aisho and the Divine Virtues.”"

We have more at stake\nnow, and it’s in everyone’s best interests for our clans to keep the peace. But we will never be at\npeace. You’ll pursue your ruthless agenda—and my clan will pursue ours. Make no mistake: We’re\nstill at war, in a different way.” She stood up, feeling the stiffness in her back unclench. “I have to\npick up my nephews from swim class. If you’ll excuse me, Ayt-jen, my family needs me.”\nCHAPTER\n63\nHome at Last\nW\nhen Anden landed in Janloon International Airport, a car and driver were waiting for him.\nCrossing the Way Away Bridge into morning traffic, Anden stared at the skyline of the city he’d left\nthree and a half years ago. The view was deeply familiar yet different; there were buildings that had\nbeen there as long as he could remember and new ones that he did not recognize. Construction cranes\nbalanced like orange storks along the waterfront, stretching their arms toward Summer Harbor. Anden\nrolled down the window and breathed in the heat and smell of Janloon, letting the urban music of car\nhorns and shouted Kekonese wash over him. The car carried him past the dense tenements of\nCoinwash and Fishtown, the condo buildings and upscale shops of North Sotto, the urban parks and\ntrendy eateries between Green Plain and Yoyoyi, the manicured estate fronts of Palace Hill. He saw\ntrees broken from recent typhoon damage, newspaper stands proclaiming the end of the Oortokon\nWar, red Autumn Festival lamps and grass streamers adorning eaves and street posts. Green and white\npaper lanterns hung from storefront windows in their respective districts.\nA nameless and profound ache gathered in Anden’s chest. Janloon was warm and dangerous, it\nthrobbed with life and hot-blooded movement, it knew that it was special, that there was no other\nplace like it in the world. Other places deceived; in other places, people hid their jade, they exchanged\nmoney under the table, and they killed in the dark. Janloon wore its savagery on its sleeve; it was a\nproud Fist among nations, it did not hide what it was. Janloon was honest.\nWhen he arrived at the Kaul house, Anden took his suitcase out of the trunk, careful not to jar his\nsplinted fingers. Two men were walking down the driveway on their way out, perhaps having\nconcluded a meeting with the Pillar. It had been so long since Anden had seen jade worn openly that\nhis eyes were drawn to the green around their wrists and necks even before he recognized their faces.\nJuen Nu and Lott Jin paused when they saw him. “Emery Anden,” Lott said after a moment.\n“Welcome back.”\nLott looked older; he was dressed in a collared shirt and smoke-gray jacket, talon knife sheathed\nat the hip, wavy hair cut short to show off the jade pierced through the tops of his ears.

He took his suitcase and\nwent into the house.\nLike Janloon itself, the Kaul family home overwhelmed Anden with its familiarity and yet there\nwere signs that things had changed. Some of the furniture was new and old pieces were rearranged.\nAnden glanced into the study and did not recognize Lan’s old space. The desk was cluttered, there\nwere more chairs, family photos on the walls, a television playing on mute. Most striking of all were\nthe signs that this was a house with small children: a playpen in one corner of the family room, a half-\nassembled train set on the floor, a stack of children’s books on the coffee table, pairs of small shoes\nnear the door. For a long minute, Anden stood in the foyer, unable to move, until Kyanla came\nthrough the kitchen with a joyful shout and ran to greet him. “Anden-se, finally you’ve come home!”\nShe’d aged visibly; her hair was gray now, her soft face wrinkled.\nAnden went out to find the Pillar sitting in the courtyard. A cigarette dangled from the fingers of\none hand, but he did not seem to be smoking it. Hilo’s gaze was distant and tired, and there were\ncircles as dark as bruises under his eyes. Anden approached and stopped in front of his cousin, but he\ndidn’t sit down in the seat opposite him at the patio table. Hilo looked up at Anden as if rousing to the\nrealization that he was there, even though Anden knew he must’ve Perceived him arriving several\nminutes ago. Neither of them spoke at first; they took each other in silently.\nAt last Anden said, “How’s Wen?”\nHilo stubbed out his unsmoked cigarette. “She’s recovering in Marenia. Dr. Truw says it could\ntake a long time, because of the brain damage. She’s partly paralyzed on the right side of her body.\nShe can understand what people are saying, but has trouble talking.” Hilo’s voice was factual and\nexpressionless, his sunken gaze nowhere nearby. Quietly, “She’s alive, at least. It could’ve been\nworse.”\nWen had been flown home from Port Massy as soon as she was able to be transported. Hami\nTumashon, working under Shae’s orders, had swiftly made a number of discreet but persuasive and\ncostly arrangements on behalf of the Weather Man’s office. The staff at the Crestwood Hotel\nconveniently failed to remember seeing anyone go up to Zapunyo’s hotel room. The police report\nconcluded that the smuggler had been assassinated by bodyguards in his own inner circle during a\nshootout that left everyone in the room dead. Several members of the Kekonese community testified\nthat Wen was Anden’s cousin and Rohn Toro’s recent girlfriend from Janloon, which was why the\nthree of them were together on the night of the brutal revenge killing by Willum Reams’s"

        "text": "that Wen was Anden’s cousin and Rohn Toro’s recent girlfriend from Janloon, which was why the\nthree of them were together on the night of the brutal revenge killing by Willum Reams’s\nreestablished Southside Crew. Wen, who was in no state to answer any questions from local\nauthorities, was medically evacuated to Janloon within forty-eight hours. It took another week and a\nhalf for Hami and the clan’s lawyers to extract Anden—long enough for him to recover in the Dauks’\nhouse under Sana’s care. Exhausted and shaken, he’d slept for days, huddled under blankets and fed\nbone broth like an invalid, but he wasn’t as sick as he’d been the last time he’d handled too much\njade.\nAt Rohn Toro’s funeral, he’d folded the Green Bone’s black gloves and laid them in the man’s\ncasket. He wished he could’ve saved Rohn as well on that terrible day. He’d tried, but Rohn’s throat\nhad been crushed in his violent final struggles and too much time had passed; by the time Anden\ncrawled over to him, the life energy was gone from his body. He wondered if the Dauks blamed him\nfor failing, but when he tried to apologize, Dauk Losun only shook his head and put a heavy hand on\nAnden’s shoulder. “A man as green as Rohn Toro, he wasn’t fated to leave this world peacefully,”\nDauk said sorrowfully. “Let the gods recognize him.” Anden had always thought of Rohn Toro as the\nmost Kekonese man in all of Southtrap, and yet he’d been as much a part of Port Massy as the Iron\nEye Bridge. Without him, Espenia once again seemed like a foreign place to Anden, one that he was\nrelieved to say goodbye to. Even bowed down with grief, the Dauks were there at the airport along\nwith Mr. and Mrs. Hian to see Anden off on the day of his departure.\nCory was not there; he’d come into town to attend Rohn’s funeral but stayed only for the day\nbefore returning to Adamont Capita. Although the circumstances were tragic, Anden was grateful for\nthe chance to see his friend one more time. And to apologize in person.\n“When you said you were busy with clan things, you didn’t mention it might get you killed.”\nCory looked unusually somber in a black suit and tie, his eyes fixed on Rohn’s casket. He rubbed a\nhand over his face and turned to Anden slowly. “My da always says you’re green in the soul, as if\nthat’s a good thing to be. It’s not, crumb.”\n“Did you get my letter?” Anden forced himself to raise his eyes from the yellowing grass at his\nfeet. “I meant everything I wrote.”\nCory’s long expression was not warm, but had enough familiar softness to make Anden’s chest\nhurt. “I haven’t forgiven you, or my da,” Cory said. “But I’m glad you’re all right, and I’m glad\nyou’re going home. I know it’s what you wanted.”\nAnden was not certain if that was still true. Standing in the Kaul courtyard, he wished he had just\nenough jade to be able to Perceive his cousin’s aura, because Hilo’s face was unreadable. “I’m sorry,"

        "text": "enough jade to be able to Perceive his cousin’s aura, because Hilo’s face was unreadable. “I’m sorry,\nHilo-jen,” Anden said. “I shouldn’t have agreed to do anything if Wen was involved.”\nHilo didn’t answer for so long that Anden wondered if he’d even heard. “Wen made her own\nchoices,” the Pillar said at last. “I know how persuasive she is, how she gets her way when her mind\nis set on something. You’re the only reason my children aren’t motherless right now.” A wounded and\nconfused expression flitted across the Pillar’s face. His voice turned hoarse and fell almost to a\nwhisper. “She disobeyed me, went behind my back for years. How can I ever forgive that?”\nAnden dropped his gaze to the paving stones. “It was never about going against you, Hilo-jen—\nfor me or Wen. I know what it’s like, to not be the person your family expects you to be. And how\nhard it is to act for yourself after that.” He cleared his throat; his voice had gone scratchy. “It’s not\nyour forgiveness we need. Just your understanding.”\nSilence fell in the courtyard, disturbed only by the warm wind that stirred the leaves in the\ncherry tree and the surface of the pond in the garden. “You have to move back home, Andy,” Hilo said\nquietly. “I’ve missed you.”\nAnden had been waiting to hear those words come out of his cousin’s mouth for years. Now,\nhowever, he felt no great relief or happiness—only the sort of heaviness that comes from wanting\nsomething for so long that the final achievement of it is a loss—because the waiting is over and the\nwaiting has become too much a part of oneself to let go of easily.\n“I’m enrolling in the College of Bioenergetic Medicine,” Anden said. “I’ve already spoken to\ntheir admissions department, and if I get my application and fees in this week, I can start in the\ncoming year. Channeling was always my strongest discipline at the Academy. Killing Gont Asch\nmade me feel like a bloodthirsty monster, but—” He tried, for the first time, to put his decision into\nwords. “This time, when I used jade, I didn’t want it for myself. I wasn’t trying to overcome anyone\nelse. I was only thinking of Wen, and the jade was just a tool in my hands that I could use to pull her\naway from death.”\nAnden let out a shaky breath. The memory of those few desperate seconds was etched indelibly\ninto his mind, more recent and vivid than even Gont’s death or his mother’s madness. “Maybe I can\nwear jade in a different way. If I’ve learned anything in Espenia, it’s that there’s more than one way to\nbe a Green Bone. I’m coming back to Janloon to stay, and I’ll wear jade again, like you always\nwanted me to, but only to heal, never to kill.” Anden paused; Hilo hadn’t said a word to interrupt him\nthe entire time. “I wouldn’t ask the clan to pay my tuition,” Anden finished.\nHilo’s mouth went crooked halfway between a grimace and a grin. “You think I care about the"

You haven’t changed as much as you think you have, Andy.” The Pillar rose from his\nchair at last and walked past Anden to the patio door. When Anden turned around, he saw the Kaul\nchildren standing at the glass, staring out at them. Hilo slid the door open and said, “Come out, you\nthree.” They ventured out shyly. Ru ducked his face and went behind his father’s leg. Jaya toddled\nforward with an excited screeching noise and fell to examining bugs on the pavers.\nAnden crouched down. “Hello, Niko. Do you know who I am?”\nThe boy gazed at him with large, calm eyes full of interest and mild skepticism. “You’re my\nuncle Andy,” he said.\n“The one I’ve told you so much about, who was studying far away in Espenia,” Hilo added.\n“He’s come home to stay now, so you’ll get to know him. Would you like that?”\nEPILOGUE\nYou’ve Come to the Right Place\nB\nero got off from his shift in the kitchen of the Double Double. He’d been working there for almost\na year now, the longest he’d ever held any kind of job in his life, and he finally had enough money\nsaved to move out of the charity home for recovering addicts. Eiten-jen had agreed to provide a\nreference letter so Bero could get an apartment of his own again. He hung up his apron and walked\nout of the casino where not long ago he’d contemplated ending his life by jumping from the\npenthouse level. Strolling down Poor Man’s Road, he passed the glittering lights of the Palace of\nFortune and the fountain in front of the Cong Lady. Across the street, a new casino was being built.\nPosters on the chain-link fence surrounding the construction site advertised the opening of the Green\nLotus casino by Enke Property Group in ten months. The influx of Espenian servicemen on leave had\nkept Janloon’s gambling tables busy over the last few years, and although most of them would soon\nbe gone, the business owners in the Armpit district were optimistic that with the end of the Oortokon\nWar, high-rolling foreign tourists would return to the city in greater numbers than before.\nBero walked south until he reached the end of Poor Man’s Road and crossed into Dog’s Head.\nThe difference was stark; on one side of Janto Avenue, the Armpit swarmed with commercial activity\nand well-dressed people spending money; on the other, small brick shops looked down on narrow\nstreets, laundry hanging from the open windows of their second-floor apartments. Bero stepped over a\nsleeping dog to enter an unmarked door on the right-hand side. He climbed the narrow stairway to a\nlounge on the upper floor. In the evening, people would fill the small dance floor and sweat to jiggy\nmusic or sit on the red benches and converse over brandy, but that would not happen for several hours\nyet. Right now, the lounge was empty except for three men who sat around a table, playing a game of\ncards and smoking while the bartender polished glasses behind the counter."

        "text": "yet. Right now, the lounge was empty except for three men who sat around a table, playing a game of\ncards and smoking while the bartender polished glasses behind the counter.\nThe card players glanced up when Bero approached. One of them, a man with a square hat and a\nthick beard down to his chest, said, “Ey?” He looked disreputable, almost certainly of mixed blood.\nBero pulled out the crumpled single-page leaflet from his pocket, the one that demanded, in bold\nblack font, Join the Revolution!\n“You handed this to me on the street the other day,” Bero said.\n“Aha,” said the man, brightening at once, and shifting his chair over to make room for another\nseat at the table. “If you’re here for the meeting, you’ve come to the right place.” He spoke with a\nforeign accent, introducing himself as Guriho, and his companions as Otonyo and Tadino.\n“I wasn’t expecting shotties,” Bero said, looking at the choker of bluffer’s jade around Otonyo’s\nthroat. He’d had enough of the barukan.\nThe men bristled, and Bero felt he’d made a mistake. Tadino said, “Call us shotties again, and\nI’ll cut your fucking balls off and salt them.” He looked like the sort that might do it, too, his face all\nangles and hard lines. “We’re Oortokon, which is an independent country of the Ygut Coalition.”\nBero shrugged; geopolitical distinctions didn’t matter to him. “You’re barukan, though.”\n“Ex-barukan. Did my time already and starting life anew.” Otonyo placed a finger under the\nchain of nephrite links encircling his neck. “I wear this because it’s symbolic. It’s to show that jade is\na tool of oppression, allowing those in power to stay in power and keep the rest of us imprisoned.\nHere in Kekon, it’s the Green Bone clans. In Espenia, it’s the military and the merchant class. In\nYgutan, the aristocracy. As jade spreads, it’ll be the same story all over the world.”\n“Unless people rise up,” Guriho said, tapping the edge of a playing card against the table. “Jade\nin the hands of the people could also break chains and free the world.”\n“I don’t want jade. Jade ruined my life.” The words came out of Bero’s mouth so quickly and\nwithout thought that he was surprised at himself. Yet as soon as he said them, he knew they were true.\nFor so long, he’d lusted after jade more than anything else in the world; he’d risked everything to\ngain it, worn it for such a short while, then lost it in equally dramatic fashion. For the past two years\nhe’d been an empty shell, unsure of what meaning remained in life. Most everyone he knew was\nmissing or dead—Cheeky, both of the Mudts, Soradiyo, Mo and Shrimps, the scrap pickers, the new\ngreen in the Rat House. All because of jade and the clans that controlled it.\nThe fact that he, Bero, was still alive when they were all dead was a lucky joke of the gods. Or it\nmight have some purpose. Bero said, “Taking down the clans, though, that sounds good.”\nAcknowledgments"

Bero said, “Taking down the clans, though, that sounds good.”\nAcknowledgments\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve written a sequel, but nothing quite prepares you for the seemingly\nimpossible task of following up the biggest, most ambitious novel you’ve ever written with an even\nbigger and more ambitious novel, the second in a trilogy, no less. My great pleasure in delivering this\nfinished book to you, dear reader, is eclipsed by sheer relief that it all worked out.\nMy appreciation once again to the team at Orbit, and most of all to my editor, Sarah Guan, who\nnever fails to push my writing in ways that add nuance, deepen the layers of the story, and make\nthings worse for the characters. If you have suffered distress on account of the traumatic ordeals\nborne by the Kaul family, it is in no small part thanks to Sarah’s encouragement.\nThanks once again to the marketing and publicity team of Alex Lencicki, Ellen Wright, Laura\nFitzgerald, and Paola Crespo, design wizards Lauren Panepinto and Lisa Marie Pompilio, editor Jenni\nHill and publicist Nazia Khatun in the UK, production overseer Andy Ball, ever-observant copyeditor\nKelley Frodel, mapmaker Tim Paul, and everyone else who had a hand in putting my book on\nphysical and virtual shelves.\nI shared an early, messy draft of Jade War with my agent, Jim McCarthy, before I allowed any\nother soul to set eyes on it, and his excellent suggestions and continued optimism convinced me that\nnot all hope was lost. (He’s good at doing that.)\nThank you to beta readers Curtis Chen, Simone Cooper, Vanessa MacLellan, Carolyn\nO’Doherty, and Sonja Thomas for the feedback and brainstorming sessions.
