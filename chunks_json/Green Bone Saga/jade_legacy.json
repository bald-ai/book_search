It was merely a convenient target because\nBero worked there and knew how to get past security. While\nthe city of Janloon shivered at the sudden onset of the coldest,\nwettest winter in decades, the bright lights and clamor of the\ngambling floor continued unabated at all hours, pouring\nmoney from high rollers and foreign tourists into the coffers of\nthe No Peak clan. That would not be the case today.\nAt ten minutes to noon, Bero pushed a luggage cart with\nthree suitcases across the casino floor and into an elevator.\nThree businessmen in the elevator were carrying on a heated\nconversation. “The Mountain is offering me a tribute rate\nthat’s fifteen percent lower. The Kauls can’t match that,”\ngrumbled a bald man in a blue suit. “Yet they’re still expecting\nme to compete with the foreign chain stores that are popping\nup like weeds because of the trade deals they’ve pushed on the\ncountry.”\nHis colleague grimaced. “Would you rather pay tribute to\nAyt Mada, though?”\n“Ayt’s a power-hungry murderer, but so what? They all\nare. She did what she had to do, to keep the Mountain clan in\nline,” said the tanned third businessman. “At least she puts\nKekonese interests first, and now that she’s finally named an\nheir, I think—”\nThe elevator door, which had begun to close, opened again\nand two foreigners stepped inside, taking up the remaining\nspace next to Bero’s luggage cart. They were in plainclothes,\nbut they didn’t seem like tourists. The three businessmen\nstopped talking and eyed the strangers with polite suspicion.\nJanloon was crawling with foreign corporate and government\nagents these days.\nThe elevator descended to the parking level and opened\nwith a quiet ping. When all the other occupants had exited,\nBero rolled the luggage cart and its contents into the parking\nlot and looked at his watch.

Eiten, the former Fist who’d given Bero his job at the\nDouble Double, was not in today. After weeks of timing the\nsecurity shifts, Bero knew that at precisely noon, none of the\nclan’s other jade warriors would be on the premises either. Of\ncourse, once the commotion started, they would arrive in short\norder, so speed was vital.\nA van pulled into the parking space next to Bero. Tadino\njumped out of the driver’s seat; Otonyo and Guriho got out of\nthe rear. Bero did not particularly like the three Oortokons,\nwith their foreign accents and ugly Ygutanian clothes,\nespecially Tadino, who had the sharp bark and narrow face of\na rat terrier. Nevertheless, they were the only people Bero had\nmet who hated the Green Bone clans as much as he did, who\nwanted to see them come crashing down.\n“Didn’t get stopped or questioned at all,” Tadino crowed.\nEven if they had been, there were no weapons or other\nsuspicious items in the van. Bero pulled the suitcases off the\nluggage cart and threw them open on the ground. Guriho,\nOtonyo, and Tadino pulled out the contents: gas masks, spray\npaint, crowbars, handguns, and tear gas grenades.\nWhen they were fully equipped, Bero used his employee\nkey to get them into the stairwell next to the elevators. At the\ntop of the stairs, he unlocked the upper set of doors, letting\nthem out into the carpeted hallway behind the casino’s kitchen.\nTadino grinned and pulled the gas mask over his face.\nGuriho and Otonyo clapped each other on the back and did the\nsame, Guriho struggling for a moment to stuff his long beard\nunder the seal of the mask. They didn’t glance back at Bero as\nthey rushed down the hall. Otonyo rolled one of the tear gas\ncanisters into the kitchen and Tadino hurled another one onto\nthe casino floor, where it began to hiss and spew its contents.\nBero flattened himself out of sight against the door of the\nstairwell as the shouting began, followed by sounds of\ncoughing, gagging, and stampeding feet. A gunshot went off,\nand noise erupted in earnest—cries of alarm above the\ntoppling of dishes and furniture, the breaking of glass, the\nmetallic banging of emergency exits, and the rapid whap of the\ncasino’s revolving doors as the patrons of the Double Double\nfled choking from the premises, spilling in a panicked rush\nfrom the dim warm comfort of their games tables onto the\nmain strip of Poor Man’s Road.\nBero wrapped a bandana over his nose and mouth and\npeered around the corner of the stairwell. He could still hear\nan awful lot of noise, but it was hard to see anything through\nthe smoke. Part of him wished he was out there causing chaos\nwith the others—firing into the air, swinging a crowbar into\nthe glass bar tops, defacing the walls and furniture.

It\nwould humiliate them and make a statement that couldn’t be\nignored. Bero scowled. He was more daring and thick-blooded\nthan any of the others. He’d done things that would make\nthose Oortokon mongrels piss themselves.\nHe pulled his head back into the stairwell and shut the\ndoor. He had nothing to prove by going out there. If the Green\nBones showed up, they would smash the legs of the fools they\ncaught. Enough close calls had made Bero value his limbs. At\none time, he’d possessed jade of his own and enough shine to\nkeep him flush with money, but that wasn’t the case anymore.\nHe hated the clans, but he needed this job.\nThe door banged open and the three men staggered into the\nstairwell, their eyes wild and bright, hair sweaty and chests\nheaving for breath. Bero hurried with them back down to the\nparking level. He went out first, ducking behind a corner as the\nnearby elevator opened and disgorged half a dozen escaping\nfloor and kitchen staff members. When they were gone, Bero\nhit the emergency stop button in the elevator to prevent it from\ngoing back up, then he let the men out of the stairwell. They\ntore off their masks and threw their gear into the suitcases.\n“Lie low for two weeks and meet back at the Little\nPersimmon,” Guriho reminded them as they got back into the\nvan. The vehicle peeled out of the parking lot, leaving Bero\nalone.\nBero wheeled the suitcases and their damning contents to\nthe garbage chute and dumped them. He made sure his\nemployee uniform was straight and unstained, then he walked\nout of the parking lot and went on his regular lunch break.\nWhen he returned thirty minutes later, there were two police\ncars and a fire truck parked outside of the Double Double, as\nwell as three No Peak Green Bones walking around, angrily\nsurveying the damage. Stranded hotel guests shivered on the\nsidewalk, waiting to be let back into their rooms. Bero stuffed\nhis hands into his pockets and waited with them, hiding his\nsmile at the red message spray-painted across the interior\nwidth of the casino’s front glass doors: THE FUTURE IS\nCLANLESS.\nCHAPTER\n2\nBetrayal\nthe sixth year, first month\nK\naul Hiloshudon studied the six businessmen dining with\nhim and hoped he would not have to kill any of them. They\nwere gathered in the largest private room in the Twice Lucky\nrestaurant and there was still plenty of food on the table, but he\nhad little appetite. Taking the lives of enemies was something\nHilo could do without hesitation, but these were men of his\nown clan, who he knew and had been friendly with to some\nextent in the past. No Peak needed every loyal member.\n“How’s your wife’s health, Kaul-jen?” asked the Lantern\nMan Fuyin Kan, bringing the rest of the casual conversation\naround the table to an awkward pause.\nHilo didn’t lose his smile, but the warmth left his eyes as\nhe met the man’s gaze across the table. “Recovery takes time,\nbut she’s doing better. Thank you for asking.”"

Thank you for asking.”\nFuyin said, “That’s good to hear. There’s nothing more\nimportant than the health and safety of our families, after all.\nMay the gods shine favor on No Peak.” He raised a glass of\nhoji in Hilo’s direction and the other businessmen echoed him\nand followed suit.\nFuyin was not a typical jadeless Lantern Man. He wore\ntwo jade rings, jade studs in his ears, and an elaborate jade\nbuckle on his belt. A former Fist, he’d left the military side of\nNo Peak fifteen years ago to run his family’s retail business.\nDespite the man’s words of polite concern, Hilo could\nPerceive Fuyin’s jade aura as a thick roiling cloud, bristling\nwith unmistakable resentment and suspicion.\nHilo pushed aside his plate and sat back as waiters\nremoved empty dishes and refilled cups of tea. He didn’t look\nat Shae sitting next to him, but he could sense the tautness in\nher aura. She didn’t appear to have eaten much either. There\nwas no more putting off the conversation.\n“I’ve invited you all here because my Weather Man tells\nme you have concerns that need to be brought up and\nanswered directly by me as Pillar,” Hilo said. “You’re all\nrespected and valued Lantern Men in the clan, so of course, I\nwant to talk things through and solve problems before they\nbecome serious misunderstandings.”\nIt was not Fuyin, but the bald man next to him, Mr. Tino,\nwho spoke up first. He was an old-timer in the clan, a friend of\nHilo’s late grandfather. “Kaul-jen,” Tino said, “given the\neconomy today and the competition we face not only from\nrivals in the Mountain clan but also foreign companies, we’ve\nrepeatedly asked the Weather Man’s office for lower tribute\nrates. As I’m sure you remember, No Peak raised tribute to\nfight the clan war, but hasn’t substantially lowered it for six\nyears.”\n“We’re still fighting the clan war, even if it’s not out in the\nopen,” Hilo reminded him. “The Mountain intends to conquer\nus sooner or later. We’ve kept tribute at a reasonable level for\neveryone and used the money to strengthen the clan as the\nWeather Man sees fit.”\nShae sat forward at his mention and said, “We have to\ngrow No Peak’s capabilities if we hope to prevail against our\nenemies. We’ve been upgrading technology systems,\nexpanding Kaul Dushuron Academy to be able to train more\nGreen Bones, and building up our overseas offices and\nbusinesses.” The Weather Man’s chief of staff, Woon\nPapidonwa, immediately handed her a file folder. Shae opened\nit and began to extract a sheaf of papers. “I can show you the\nclan’s budget for the coming year and exactly where the\ntribute income is being—”\nAnother Lantern Man, the darkly tanned Mr. Eho, waved\ndown the gesture impatiently. “I don’t doubt you’re spending\nthe money. The problem is how you’re spending it. No Peak\ncontinues chasing business in Espenia, which will surely harm"

No Peak\ncontinues chasing business in Espenia, which will surely harm\nour country in the long run.” He avoided looking at the\nWeather Man, who he’d disapproved of on previous occasions.\n“Young people are too influenced by foreign ways. That’s why\nyou see more crime and social problems these days. What\nhappened last week at the Double Double casino, for example.\nDisgraceful. And the hooligans responsible weren’t caught.”\nHilo’s eyes narrowed at Eho’s lecturing tone. “If you want\nto blame someone for crime, think about how many barukan\ngang members the Mountain clan has brought into the country\nto pad their ranks. But that’s beside the point. I know the\nMountain is undercutting us, offering you lower tribute rates,\nand suddenly you feel it’s unfair to pay your usual amount\nwhen it seems you could do better.” The uncomfortable silence\nthat answered him was ample confirmation. Several of the\nLantern Men were studiously avoiding his stare.\nFuyin Kan, however, did not look away.\n“Switching allegiance would be a drastic and difficult\ndecision,” Fuyin said. It would not only affect a Lantern Man’s\nfinances, but where he chose to live, which martial school his\nchildren could attend, his social connections, and who his\nfriends and enemies would be. “We don’t want to go that far,\nwhich is why we’ve come as a group hoping for\naccommodation.”\nThe rest of the Lantern Men sat forward in agreement.\nFuyin had let others speak first, but it was apparent that he was\nthe leader among them, as Hilo had suspected. This is going to\nend badly. Hilo felt certain of this, but nevertheless, he said,\n“We can’t lower tribute right away. I can give you my word as\nPillar that as our overseas businesses grow, we’ll share that\nbenefit with the whole clan. The Weather Man’s office will\nadjust your tribute downward in stages, over the next five\nyears.” He had no idea if that made financial sense, but it\nsounded reasonable. Since Shae’s aura didn’t begin to surge\nwith ire toward him, he assumed she could get it done.\nFuyin shook his head. “That’s hardly any compromise at\nall. We’ve all agreed that it would be only fair for No Peak to\nmatch the Mountain’s offer. And we believe strongly that there\nneeds to be a change in the direction of the clan. An end to\ngrowing business overseas and focusing instead on defending\nour interests at home.”\nShae’s jade aura rippled with consternation, but she spoke\nfirmly. “If we lower tribute payments while also giving up on\nour fastest growing source of revenue, the clan would lose\nmoney on both ends. We’d be setting ourselves up to be\ndestroyed.”\nSome of the Lantern Men muttered at this, but Fuyin\nspread his hands. “The Mountain is doing fine. Are you saying\nthe No Peak clan can’t do the same? If so, can you blame us if\nwe decide to act together for the sake of our futures?”\nIt did not sound like a threat, but it was.

        "text": "we decide to act together for the sake of our futures?”\nIt did not sound like a threat, but it was. Fuyin had\ngathered together half a dozen disaffected Lantern Men and\nnow he was saying that if No Peak refused to meet their\ncollective demands, they would defect en masse to the\nMountain clan. Even Shae had no immediate reply to such\ndaring extortion.\nAn anger weighty with disappointment settled over Hilo.\n“Fuyinjen,” he said, fixing all his attention on the former Fist\nand ignoring the other men in the room, “why would you\ncome here to ask me for anything, when you’ve already turned\nto the Mountain? Is it on Ayt Mada’s orders that you’re trying\nto drag these other people down with you?”\nFuyin’s expression became a blank wall. “What are you\ntalking about?”\n“You’ve been paying tribute to the Mountain clan for\nmonths. I can show everyone the proof that Maik Tar dug up\n—or you can admit it rather than lie to my face.” Hilo’s words\nwere spoken calmly but with unmistakable cold portent.\n“You’re not just a Lantern Man like these others. You’re a\nGreen Bone who’s betrayed his clan oaths.”\nComplete silence fell across the table. The oblivious burble\nof noise from the rest of the Twice Lucky beyond the sliding\ndoors seemed cacophonous. The other Lantern Men edged\nback in their seats, the color draining from their faces, as\nFuyin slowly stood. “You accuse me of betraying the clan? I\nwas a first-rank Fist when you were still an insolent boy in the\nAcademy. You’re the one, Kaul Hiloshudon, who’s betrayed\nall of us.”\nThe bitterness Hilo had sensed in Fuyin’s aura swelled into\na storm, and the careful veneer of politeness he’d maintained\nuntil now fell away. “My father built a thriving business out of\nnothing but his sweat and grit and the patronage of the clan.\nThank the gods he’s no longer alive to see his company pushed\nout of the market, all because you’ve opened up our country to\nforeigners like a whore opening her legs.” Fuyin’s voice\nthickened and trembled. “My son admired you so much and\nwanted to be just like you. He was only twenty years old,\nbarely a Finger for six months, when he was killed for nothing,\nin a clan war that would never have happened under your\nbrother or grandfather. You have the arrogance to expect my\nallegiance? No, Kaul-jen, you’re a pup of a Pillar, and your\nsister licks Espenian boots. I owe nothing to you.”\nHilo did not speak for an uncharacteristically long\nmoment. He could Perceive the thudding heartbeats and held\nbreaths all around him, especially Shae’s, but they seemed\ndistant compared to the sensation of building pressure in his\nhands and head. At last he said, “Fuyin-jen, I can see that the\nhardships you’ve suffered have made you hate me, but you\nwere wrong to let yourself be used by Ayt Mada.” He stood to\nface the man. “You could’ve come to talk to me at any point if\nyou were so unhappy.

Whether it’s business trouble that’s\nmaking you feel like giving up on life, or if you can’t forgive\nme for the death of your son, you could’ve asked to leave\nhonorably, maybe even to form your own small clan in another\npart of the country. Because of your family’s good standing\nand past sacrifice, I would’ve allowed that. You shouldn’t have\ndefected to the Mountain, and you shouldn’t have swept others\nalong with you by trying to damage No Peak with this fucking\ncharade.”\nFuyin straightened to his full height. He was taller than the\nPillar, in his forties but still in excellent physical shape, known\nfor training with much younger Green Bones. “You suggest I\nshould’ve begged to leave the city I was born in, to live like a\nworthless outcast? Do you expect me to cut off my ear now to\ngrovel for my own life? Never.” The man’s face hardened with\nterrible resolve. “Kaul Hiloshudon, Pillar of No Peak, I offer\nyou a clean blade.”\nA murmur of stunned apprehension traveled through the\nroom. No one had challenged Kaul Hilo to a duel in years.\nFuyin said, “Name the place and wea—”\n“I refuse.” Hilo’s words stopped the air in the room. The\nPillar’s famous temper came into his face. “You’re a traitor.\nYou don’t deserve a duel. I’m sorry for your son and your\nmisfortune in business, but many of us suffer terrible tragedy\nin our lives yet we don’t break our brotherly oaths.”\nFuyin was nonplussed for a moment. Even Shae and Woon\nstared at Hilo in surprise. To anyone’s knowledge, Kaul\nHiloshudon had never turned down a personal challenge.\nFuyin rocked back on his heels in disbelief. “You’re a\ncoward,” he spat.\n“I’m the Pillar of the clan,” Hilo said. “I’d be foolish not to\nassume you’re still a capable fighter, Fuyin-jen. Maybe you\nhave nothing to live for anymore, but I can’t afford to risk any\ninjuries that might make me take time away from my family\nand responsibilities.” Hilo frowned at his own words, aware\nthat he was explaining his refusal to himself more than Fuyin.\n“If you want to keep your life, you can give what you own to\nthe clan and accept exile from Kekon. Otherwise, I can grant\nyou a death of consequence, with a blade in your hand. That’s\nall.”\nAs Hilo spoke, the door to the room slid open and Juen\nNu, the Horn of No Peak, came in with Maik Tar and Iyn Ro.\nThe three Green Bones had been waiting downstairs on Hilo’s\norders, prepared to enter if they Perceived any threat from the\nmen at the table. Mr. Tino and Mr. Eho edged away from\nFuyin with wide eyes, as if he’d become a ticking explosive.\nFuyin’s eyes darted and his hands twitched as he stood alone.\nJuen, Maik, and Iyn began to walk around the large round"

None of the Lantern Men\nthey passed dared to leave their seats.\nShae began to stand, her aura crackling with alarm. The\nWeather Man had called together these Lantern Men for what\nwas supposed to be a conciliatory business lunch that was\nabout to turn into an execution. “Hilo,” she hissed, loudly\nenough to be heard. “It’s not right to do it here like this. Let\n—”\nNo one heard the rest of her suggestion because Fuyin\nyanked a compact pistol from a concealed waistband holster\nand began firing.\nTar reacted at once, raising a Deflection in front of the\nPillar that sent the small-caliber rounds straight up into the\ndining room’s ceiling, knocking out two of the hanging lights.\nWoon seized Shae by the arm and pulled her behind him. Juen\nand Iyn pushed the other Lantern Men to the ground. Fuyin\nKan dropped his gun and hurled himself Light, clearing the\nspan of the dining table in one snarling bound, his drawn talon\nknife seeking Hilo’s throat.\nHilo met the attack, hopping Light onto the table and\ncatching Fuyin’s elbow, jamming his momentum and the\ntrajectory of his weapon. Shoving back hard into his\nopponent’s center of gravity, he unbalanced Fuyin as soon as\nthe man’s grip on Lightness faltered and his feet touched the\ntable. The former Fist stumbled, but threw a lethal Channeling\nstrike that narrowly glanced off Hilo’s Steel as the Pillar\ntwisted his torso, pivoting sharply and dragging the other man\nforward with his rotation. Fuyin’s foot caught a bowl half-full\nof cooling soup as he went staggering headlong toward the\nedge of the table. Plates, glasses, and food went flying from\nunder their feet.\nMany years ago, when he was a teenager in the Academy,\nHilo had done balance and Lightness drills by sparring\nopponents on thin ledges and wobbly platforms. At the time,\nhe thought the exercises silly. Fights happened on asphalt and\nconcrete, not on logs over waterfalls like one might see in\nmovies. On the dais of the dining table, he entertained a\nfractional second remembrance of his instructors lecturing him\nthat no Green Bone, no matter how well prepared, is assured\nof choosing ideal conditions. Tangled close, with both of them\ntipping forward, Hilo’s left hand darted up and encircled\nFuyin’s head from behind as if it were a relayball he were\npreparing to pass. The talon knife that appeared in his right\nhand came up in a flash and sank into Fuyin’s throat. Gripping\nthe man’s hair, he pushed Fuyin’s face onto the table and his\nneck further onto the blade as he landed on his knees with a\ncrash of broken plates. Hilo tore the knife upward with all his\nStrength, severing the windpipe.\nFuyin thrashed for a second, scattering more objects off\nthe table before he lay still, the pool of blood under his chin\nspreading in a dark stain across the red tablecloth and\nmingling with the spilled soup broth and chunks of strewn"

Hilo got down off the dining table. It had all happened in\nless than a minute, and his hearing was still muffled from the\ngunshots in the enclosed space. When he spoke to the\nremaining five Lantern Men, who were picking themselves up\noff the ground, he couldn’t be sure if he was yelling or talking\nnormally. “Is there anyone else who has a personal grievance,\nor is so dissatisfied that he wants to take up Fuyin’s\ndemands?”\nThe Lantern Men climbed to their feet meekly. Mr. Eho\nlooked at Fuyin’s body and swallowed noisily before touching\nhis clasped hands to his forehead and bending in a deep salute\nto the Pillar. “Kaul-jen, I’m embarrassed to say I went along\nwith Fuyin out of financial selfishness. I knew nothing of his\nshocking and abhorrent treachery to the clan. I’m grateful and\nperfectly happy with your suggested compromise on tribute\nrates.”\n“Same with me, Kaul-jen,” said Mr. Tino quickly, brushing\noff his pants. “Forgive my foolishness. I thought Fuyin was\nstanding up for all of us, but now I see that I was wrong to\ntrust him. We’re fortunate you saw through him right away.”\nThe other Lantern Men nodded shamefacedly, reiterating their\nsteadfast allegiance to the clan.\nHilo stifled a desire to have each of them soundly beaten\nbefore demanding they cut off their ears in front of him to\nretain their patronage. But he didn’t think the businessmen had\nthick enough blood to handle that, and with Fuyin’s body still\non the table, he’d already made his point. There would be little\nto gain in cowing them further, besides the satisfaction. Hilo\nturned away in disgust. “Get them out of here,” he said to his\nFists.\nIyn Ro escorted the chastised Lantern Men out of the\nbuilding. They were only too eager to leave, casting brief,\nnervous glances backward as they departed. A few of them\nmight indeed be repentant or worried enough to come back\nwith their ears in boxes, but Hilo didn’t care. In his opinion,\njadeless Lantern Men could never be counted on. Protected by\naisho and motivated by money, they expected strength and\nprotection from a patron clan but would switch allegiance for\ntheir own benefit and survival. Ayt couldn’t be blamed for\ntrying her best to steal them.\nJuen said, “I’d better go talk to Mr. Une and calm\neverything down.” The sounds of gunshots and violence had\nsurely disrupted the Twice Lucky’s lunch hour and agitated the\nold restaurateur. After the Horn had left, Tar threw his arm\nover Hilo’s shoulders and said with mock petulance, “You\ntook him down too quickly, Hilo-jen. I’m your Pillarman,\ncouldn’t you have let me earn even a bit of his green?”\nHilo scowled over sourly at Fuyin’s sprawled body without\nreturning his brother-in-law’s grin. “Take his jade for the"

You told me we had to have this\nmeeting to sort things out with those grumbling Lantern Men.\nThey’re not grumbling anymore, are they?”\n“Don’t you think we should’ve talked beforehand if you\nwere planning to execute Fuyin in front of everyone? Why\ndidn’t you tell me you had proof that he turned to the\nMountain?”\n“Because I didn’t,” he snapped. “I had a feeling. When I\nsaw his reaction, then I knew for sure. He already had a\ngrudge, so it’s no wonder Ayt got to him. He was determined\nto die and bring me to the grave with him.” Despite knowing\nthis, Hilo could not help but take the treason of a former Fist\npersonally. Fuyin’s accusations rattled in his head and he\nwanted to get out of the room, away from the man’s body.\nHe began to push past Shae, but she moved into his path\nagain. “This isn’t good, Hilo,” she insisted. “Executing a\ntraitor might keep people in line for a while, but it doesn’t\nsolve the problems that made those Lantern Men turn against\nus in the first place. We haven’t been talking about the issues\nthe way a Pillar and Weather Man ought to.”\nHilo bared his teeth as he leaned over his sister. “You want\nto talk to me as Weather Man? Then do the Weather Man’s\njob. Tell me how the fuck the Mountain is outspending us and\nstealing our businesses with tribute rates that we know are\nunsustainable. Tell me how we stop them and win. If you can’t\ntell me that, then spare me your godsdamned lectures.”\nShae opened her mouth to retort, then shut it again so hard\nhe heard the snap of her back teeth coming together. She\nglowered at him, face flushed with aggravation. Woon, who’d\nbeen hovering nearby, put a hand on the Weather Man’s\nshoulder and drew her back as Hilo finally barged out of the\nroom.\nJuen was still in conversation with an anxious Mr. Une, so\nHilo was spared any of the aging restaurateur’s hand-wringing\nor brow mopping. Some of the usual lunch crowd at the Twice\nLucky had cleared out during the brief spate of violence,\nperhaps worried it might spill out into the rest of the\nrestaurant, or spooked by last week’s attack by anarchists at\nthe Double Double casino.

At Hilo’s appearance, they muttered respectfully,\ntouching their foreheads and trying to get a glimpse past him\ninto the room with the body, craning their necks with the sort\nof morbid curiosity afforded to spectacular automobile crashes\nand burning buildings. By evening, word would be out all over\nJanloon that Fuyin Kan was dead, a traitor to his clan.\nHilo went out the front doors and got into the driver’s seat\nof the Duchesse Signa. He had his own parking spot at the\nTwice Lucky, guarded every time he dined there. Tar followed\nhim out and tapped the passenger-side window, leaning his\narms through when Hilo rolled down the glass. “Where are\nyou going?” the Pillarman asked, with a grumpiness that\nmight’ve been protective concern or merely displeasure at\nbeing left behind.\n“I’m going to take a drive, to clear my head,” Hilo said,\nputting the key in the ignition. “Just help Juen and Iyn clean\nthings up here.” There were times Hilo would hesitate to leave\nMaik Tar and Iyn Ro together in handling clan matters, on\naccount of their wildly hot and cold relationship, but they were\ngetting along right now. “And get ready for your trip to Port\nMassy. It’s going to be cold over there; bring warm clothes.\nYou got everything else you need? Tickets, passport, and\neverything?”\n“Yeah, sure,” his brother-in-law said.\n“I’ll be back home in a couple hours.” He left Tar in the\nparking lot, looking vaguely forlorn in the rearview mirror as\nhe watched the Duchesse drive away.\n_______\nHilo drove for half an hour in no particular direction, blasting\nthe heater in defiance of the icy air pressing down on the city\nlike a cold towel against the skin. The streets were\nuncommonly subdued, Janloon’s bright colors washed out by a\ngray and sunless sky. People were excited that snow was\nfalling in the mountains.\nHe found himself, without any real thought, driving into\nthe Docks and pulling up in front of the Lilac Divine\nGentleman’s Club. A lot of things had changed in Janloon over\nthe years, but the Lilac Divine was not one of them. It was,\nHilo mused wryly, a reliable business unthreatened by modern\ntimes or foreign competition. A valet took his car, and as soon\nas he stepped through the door, Mrs. Sugo, the Lantern Man\nproprietor, greeted him with a smile that struck Hilo as\npatently false. She never showed him any discourtesy of\ncourse, and she always made certain his visits were exactly as\nhe asked for, but she was decidedly unenthusiastic about the\nPillar’s irregular and unannounced appearances.\n“Kaul-jen,” said Mrs. Sugo, saluting him and showing him\ninto a plush, rose-scented room with a sofa. “How good to see\nyou again. Would you like me to send for Sumi? Or Vina?”\nHilo shook his head. “Someone else.”\nMrs. Sugo’s painted smile wavered but remained gamely\nin place. “If I might ask, Kaul-jen, in the interest of serving\nyou better, is there anything objectionable about any of the"

He tossed his jacket over the back\nof the sofa and poured himself a glass of citrus-infused water\nfrom the jug on the table. “Just don’t send me any of the ones\nmy brother used. I don’t like the idea of that.”\nMrs. Sugo pressed her lips together, hiding her discontent\nwith a bow of acquiescence as she retreated from the room and\nclosed the door behind her. Hilo flopped down onto the sofa\nand closed his eyes, rubbing the corners of them with his\nthumbs. He’d never understood why Lan used to come to this\nplace and thought his brother must’ve been desperately lonely.\nNow he felt rather sorry for himself, to be in the same\nsituation. He’d been Pillar of the clan for six years. Longer\nthan Lan. He and his brother had not been much alike, but\nperhaps the position of Pillar did the same thing to every man\n—isolated him and wore him down before killing him, either\nquickly or slowly.\nHe couldn’t help but wonder if Ayt Mada, who’d murdered\nmany people in her own clan, ever felt deeply disappointed or\nhurt the way he did, or if she was naturally coldhearted and\nable to act without feeling. He’d tried unsuccessfully to have\nAyt assassinated by the Ven family in the Mountain, so it\nought to be no surprise that his enemy would likewise try to\nexploit any discontent or weakness in No Peak. Still, Shae was\nright, as much as Hilo hated to admit it. Fuyin’s betrayal was\nnot an isolated grievance, and his death would not solve the\nbigger, glaring problem: After having failed on multiple\noccasions to have Hilo killed, the Mountain was now waging a\npersistent campaign to destroy No Peak economically.\nA gentle knock came. Hilo got off the sofa and opened the\ndoor to find a lovely woman, darker skinned and curvier than\nthe one who’d attended him on his last visit some two or three\nmonths ago. She was carrying an ebony tray with a bottle of\nhoji, some date cakes arranged on a delicate clay plate, and\ntwo cups. “Kaul-jen,” she said solicitously, but with a tight\nundercurrent to her voice that suggested Mrs. Sugo and the\nother charm girls had prepared her for what to expect. “May I\ncome in?”\nHilo held the door open for her. She placed the tray on the\nlow table in front of the sofa, knelt next to it, and folded the\ndraping hem of her sleeve back fastidiously as she opened the\nbottle of hoji and poured two servings into the small cups. The\nhoji was well aged, with a robust and complex scent.\nHilo drank it down, then said, “Get on the bed.”\n“Kaul-jen,” the woman said, in a suggestive and soothing\ntone, “we’re in no rush at all. You can stay all night. Why not\nrelax for a while and let me treat you to a more enjoyable\nexperience? Surely you could use some time away from the"

Surely you could use some time away from the\ndemands of being the Pillar.

I don’t need conversation.” He stood. “I won’t take long\nif you cooperate.”\nThe charm girl stared at him. She opened her mouth as if\nto try again to persuade him, before apparently coming to the\nindignant decision to not bother. Without any further attempt\nat pretense, she tipped back her shot of hoji in one quick gulp,\nthen stood and unfastened the sash around her silk robe, letting\nit fall to the ground in a heap. She lay down naked on the bed,\nwith a scowl of resignation that Hilo decided was more\nattractive than her practiced smile, on account of being\ngenuine. She was smooth-skinned and had a mole on the flat\nof her stomach, near her navel.\nHilo undressed. The charm girl’s eyes widened at the\nbloodstains on his shirt cuffs as he unbuttoned them, and the\ntalon knife he unbuckled and laid on the table next to the tray.\nThey widened further at the sight of his bare torso—\ncollarbone, chest, and nipples studded with glinting pieces of\njade. “Don’t touch any of it, and it won’t do anything to you,”\nhe said, reading the anxiety in her eyes. He took one of the\ncomplimentary condoms from the nightstand. “Turn around\nand get on your hands and knees.”\nAfter he was done fucking her and she had gotten up to go\nto the bathroom, Hilo dressed, gathered his jacket and knife,\nand ate two of the date cakes on the tray. He left a generous tip\non the bedside table. Charm girls made their real money from\nlong-term clients, who often bought them gifts and paid extra\nfor exclusive access. Since he didn’t expect to see the woman\nagain, he thought it only right that he leave extra compensation\nfor her wasted time.\nDownstairs, Mrs. Sugo wished him good night with a stiff\nsmile. He could understand her annoyance. The Lilac Divine\nwas a highclass establishment, with charm girls who could\nplay music and recite poetry and accompany clients to black-\ntie galas. He was using it like a cheap brothel. The Duchesse\nwas waiting for him at the front of the building. The valet had\nnot bothered to park his car elsewhere, knowing from prior\nvisits that he was unlikely to be long in the club. Hilo walked\nall around his prized vehicle and bent down to peer underneath\nit. Ever since Maik Kehn, his brother-in-law and former Horn,\nhad been killed by a car bomb, Hilo was exceedingly careful\nwith the family’s cars and drivers, watchful for threats that\ncould not be Perceived with jade senses. “Has it been out of\nyour sight at all, even for a second?” he demanded. The valet\npromised on his life that it had not. Satisfied that his car had\nnot been tampered with, Hilo got in, turned the key, and\nheaded for home.\n_______"

Satisfied that his car had\nnot been tampered with, Hilo got in, turned the key, and\nheaded for home.\n_______\nHe walked into the house before dinner. His mother and\nKyanla, the housekeeper, were talking in the kitchen, and he\ncould smell frying vegetables. Niko, a precocious reader,\nlooked up from his spot on the sofa only long enough to say,\n“Hi, Uncle,” before turning back to his comic book, but Ru\nand Jaya ran to greet him, both of them jabbering over each\nother to get his attention and tell him things. Hilo kissed his\nson on the head and let his daughter climb onto his back,\ncarrying her up the stairs.\n“Da, show me your new jade!” Ru said, skipping close\nbehind his father.\nHilo turned at the top of the staircase and looked down at\nthe boy. “What new jade are you talking about?”\n“The new jade you won,” Ru demanded, standing up on\nhis toes and grabbing Hilo around the waist. “Uncle Tar said\nyou killed someone today, a man who was in the clan but who\nturned bad. Where’s your new jade?”\nHilo made a low, disapproving noise in his throat. His\nbrother-in-law must’ve arrived home earlier and already filled\nthe children’s ears with a simplified account of the day’s\nevents. Tar was always honest with his nephews and niece\nabout the realities of being a Green Bone and felt it was only\nright that they understand their father was not just their father,\nbut also the leader of a large and powerful clan, which was\nwhy he was often busy and not at home. He had enemies who\nwanted to kill him, and sometimes he would have to kill them\nfirst, so that he could return home each evening to tuck them\ninto bed.\nIt wasn’t that Hilo disagreed with Tar, but he didn’t want\nRu’s head filled with Green Bone stories. They would only\nmake him dwell on what he lacked, instead of confident in\nwho he was. Ru was a stone-eye; he could never wear jade or\nhold any significant rank in No Peak. It saddened Hilo that his\nson could not become a jade warrior, but it was somewhat of a\nrelief as well, to know that one of his children might have a\nsimpler, safer life.\nHilo said sternly, “I don’t have any new jade. I wear\nenough and we should save the green we take for the future,\nsince we’re already very fortunate. And stop listening to\neverything your uncle Tar tells you.” Hilo bent and set Jaya\ndown, giving both of their heads an affectionate rub. “Go back\ndownstairs and get ready for dinner.”\nAfter the children ran off, Hilo stood back up and pushed\nopen the bedroom door. Wen was resting, propped up in bed\nwith pillows supporting her back against the headboard. She\nlooked weary, as she always did after her physiotherapy\nappointments. Relearning how to do simple things, like walk\nsmoothly, pass a cup from one hand into another, or stand\nwithout need for support, required a tremendous effort that left\nher physically and emotionally drained.\nHilo stood in the doorway for a few seconds, then walked\nover and sat down next to her on the edge of the bed.

He\nplaced a hand on her outstretched leg. “How was it today?”\n“Not terrible,” Wen said. “I can … t-touch my toes and …\nstand up again without falling down.” She smiled wanly.\n“Quite a v-victory.”\nIt broke Hilo’s heart every day to see Wen so feeble and\nincompetent, to hear her speak with such ponderous difficulty.\nHe’d had to leave the room at times, unable to bear seeing her\ndriven to helpless tears of frustration by her inability to do\nsomething as simple as complete a sentence that was perfectly\nformed in her mind but would not come out correctly. At least\nshe was much improved from a year ago, when she couldn’t\nmove one side of her body at all and could barely speak\ncoherently. Back then, when he wasn’t even certain if her mind\nand personality had survived intact, he was ashamed to say\nthere had been a few awful periods of despair when he’d\nwondered if it would’ve been less cruel to both of them if\nAnden had not succeeded in reviving her from death.\nWen had always been graceful and well-spoken, confident\nin a gentle way, with a perceptive and determined will. He’d\nloved her more than anything in the world. Now he did not\nknow how he felt. Sometimes when he looked at his wife he\nfelt a surge of the feverish, all-consuming desire to hold her\nand make love to her and protect her at all costs. More often,\nhowever, he felt a numb aching anger, a cold disbelief and\nunforgiving rage. She had disobeyed him, kept so many of her\nactivities secret from him, put herself in harm’s way, nearly\nleaving him a widower and their children motherless. He’d\ndone all he could to keep her safe and give her everything she\ncould want, to be good to her, and she had brought all this pain\non them.\n“Is Shae … coming over … this evening?” Wen asked.\n“No,” he said.\n“You should… . in-in-in—” He could see her grasping for\nthe word, trying to push it out of her throat like a bit of stuck\nfood. “Ask her … to come over more often.”\nHilo stood up to go without answering.

She told herself\nthis, but the shallow self-reassurance was not convincing.\nShe was the Weather Man; it was her job to be one step\nahead of everyone. The Weather Man reads the clouds, so the\nsaying went. Today, Hilo’s instincts had been sharper than her\njudgment. The fact stung badly. And it was true that she’d\npursued trade with Espenia in ways that benefited No Peak but\nopened up Kekonese industries to more foreign competition.\nShe’d contributed to Fuyin’s troubles and couldn’t blame the\nman for his hatred. It was her responsibility to maintain the\nloyalty of No Peak’s Lantern Men so that her brother did not\nhave to execute them.\nWoon crouched down next to her seat and put a hand on\nher knee. Thank the gods he hadn’t been injured in the\nmayhem. Her chief of staff rarely acted without thinking, but\nthe moment Fuyin had drawn the gun, he’d instinctively tried\nto shield her even though she wore more jade than he did. She\nwasn’t sure whether to thank or admonish him.\n“Shae-jen, you did the right thing, trying to broker a\ncompromise,” the Weather Man’s Shadow said quietly. “Fuyin\nwas the one who provoked violence, probably for a\nconsiderable reward.”\n“It’s the sort of trap Ayt Mada would set,” Shae agreed\nglumly. If No Peak gave in to the Lantern Men’s demands, it\nwould invite financial ruin. If it let businesses leave without\nconsequence, it would fail even faster. Shae lifted her head. At\nleast now, with Fuyin dead and his treachery revealed, they\nhad other options. “We can still get something out of this mess\nif we move quickly to make sure Fuyin’s assets stay within the\nclan.”\nHer chief of staff nodded at once. “Fortunately, the Pillar\ndidn’t agree to a duel.” The victor of a clean-bladed duel could\nclaim his opponent’s jade but couldn’t touch his family or\nassets. “We can buy out Fuyin’s heirs and sell his company\npiecemeal at a discount to our other Lantern Men in the retail\nsector who’ve been asking for relief. That should more than\nmollify them. I’ll go to the most important ones and speak to\nthem in person this week.” That would ensure the message\nwas clear and delivered straight from the Weather Man’s\noffice: The traitor was dead and everything his family had\nbuilt would go to those who were loyal.\n“Thank you, Papi-jen.” Shae put her hand on top of his. “I\ndon’t know what I’d do without you.” A little of the strain in\nher shoulders loosened, although Hilo’s harsh words were still\na weight on her chest. She was no stranger to her brother’s\nopprobrium, but the last time they’d been on such bad terms,\nshe’d been able to escape to another country for two years.\nNow, she had to work with Hilo to manage the clan while\nputting up with his avoidance and recrimination.

She’d kept secrets from the\nPillar, disobeyed him, sent Anden and Wen to carry out an\nassassination plan in Port Massy that had nearly gotten them\nkilled.\nAnd Hilo was right about something else: She did not\nknow how Ayt was winning, or how to stop her.\nThe restaurant staff had closed off the area around the\ndining room. Tar and Iyn carried Fuyin’s body out the back of\nthe building without disturbing the other diners, and Mr. Une\ncame in with Juen to inspect the damage to the light fixtures\nand walls, which the clan would compensate him for. Waiters\nefficiently cleared away the bloodstained tablecloth and\ncleaned up the spilled food.\n“We should get back to the office.” Shae forced herself to\nstand. “Hami is probably waiting for us.”\n_______\nHami Tumashon was different from how Shae remembered\nhim. After three and a half years abroad, he’d put on some\nweight and adopted a few Espenian affectations; he was\nwearing an athletic shirt under his suit jacket and drinking\nfrom an oversized travel mug full of nutmeg spiced coffee\nwhen he came into the Weather Man’s office. Most noticeably\nto Shae, he had not yet put his jade back on, and the absence\nof his usual sturdy jade aura made him seem like a splitreality\nversion of himself.\nShae had taken off her jade as well, years ago, then\nreclaimed all of it, then violently lost much of it again. She\nwondered if, at each of those traumatic turning points in her\nlife, reality had indeed fractured. Perhaps in some alternate\ntimeline, a different Shae had continued on in another way,\nand the woman that remained had seemed to other people to be\na disconcertingly altered replacement.\nWhile she and Woon had been in the Twice Lucky, lunch\nhad been catered into the main conference room so the office\ncould celebrate Hami’s triumphant return to Janloon. The\nformer Master Luckbringer had grown the clan’s branch\noperations in Port Massy to a staff of twenty and recently\nmoved it into a larger downtown office. Revenue out of\nEspenian holdings had expanded to an impressive eight\npercent of the clan’s total, even before taking into account the\nuplift to No Peak’s tributary businesses in Kekon as a result of\nthe clan facilitating import and export activities. For a man to\nhave been executed today over the backlash to this one bright\nspot in No Peak’s fortunes was a sour irony.\n“Terun Bin works like an ox and has a mind as sharp as a\ntalon knife. He’ll do fine over there,” Hami declared, settling\nacross from Shae in the sitting area of her office. Terun Bin\nwould be Hami’s successor. He was already a highly regarded\nsenior Luckbringer at the age of twenty-eight, but\nunfortunately, his jade aptitude was poor, perhaps because he\nwas one-quarter Abukei, although he did not appear to be of\nmixed blood at all and the fact was not common knowledge.\nHe’d been educated at a competitive academic school instead\nof a martial academy, earning only a single jade stone through"

At Woon’s suggestion, Shae had promoted\nTerun and sent him to Port Massy, where his lack of green\nwould not drag down his reputation, and Hami had spent the\npast two months transitioning him into the top role there.\n“You’ve accomplished even more than I expected,” Shae\nsaid. “Terun will have a large shadow to fill.” She motioned\nfor her secretary to bring tea into the room. Her nerves were\nstill frayed, and she was glad that without his jade, Hami could\nnot Perceive the lingering jitteriness in her aura. Woon\nprobably could, but he would never let on.\nOne thing that had not changed about Hami was his\ncandor. “The problem we have in Espenia is that jade is still\nillegal in that country. That’s something Terun can’t solve, no\nmatter how smart and hardworking he is. As long as that\nremains the case, everything we’ve built there is at risk and\ncould drag the clan down in the long run.”\nWoon was sitting between them in the armchair to Shae’s\nright. “We’ve kept our businesses in Espenia completely\nseparate from any activity involving jade on the Horn’s side of\nthe clan, and taken precautions to insulate them legally.”\n“All of that is extra effort and cost to the clan,” Hami\npointed out. “I’ve hired Luckbringers from Janloon into the\nPort Massy branch over the years, but several turned down the\nopportunity because they or their family members were Green\nBones unwilling to take off their jade to move to Espenia. And\nthe problem extends beyond the Weather Man’s office. Many\nof our tributary Kekonese companies would like to grow\ninternationally, but it’s too difficult for their staff to travel to\nand from Espenia when every Green Bone has to go through\nthe trouble of securing a visa with extra paperwork\ndocumenting their jade upon entry and exit, and even so,\nthey’re only allowed to stay for twenty days out of the year.”\nShae sighed. She knew it was a problem. “We’re hiring\nmore lawyers to handle the work, and looking for ways to\nstreamline the process.”\nHami plowed on. “How many of the clan-sponsored\nstudents who’ve gone to study overseas are Green Bones? I’m\nguessing not many. What family wants to send their son or\ndaughter to Kaul Dushuron Academy for eight years to\nbecome proficient in the jade disciplines, only to have them\nmove away to a place where wearing jade is a crime? Yet it’s\nGreen Bones we would most like to sponsor. They’re the ones\nwho’re most loyal to the clan, who would return and use a\nforeign education for No Peak’s benefit.” Hami blew out a\nloud breath. “This pointless and ignorant law in Espenia is\ncreating far too much costly business friction for us.”\nShae cupped her hands around the warm teacup her\nsecretary set down in front of her.

The former\nMaster Luckbringer was not done, however; he took a noisy\nsip of his coffee and said, “It might get even worse, Kaul-jen.\nThere are rumblings that the law could change again and there\nwill be heavy penalties placed on Espenian companies who do\nbusiness with whatever the Espenian government deems as\n‘criminal organizations.’ Since civilian ownership of jade is\nillegal, and the Green Bone clans hold and distribute jade, they\ncould declare No Peak a ‘criminal organization’ and not only\nprevent other companies from working with us, but in the\nworst-case scenario, bar us from operating in that country\naltogether if they wanted to.”\nWoon drew his head back in disbelief. “The Espenian\ngovernment itself purchases jade from Kekon for military use.\nIf they can declare us to be criminals for something that has\nbeen in our culture for thousands of years, wouldn’t they have\nto also declare their own government to be illegal?”\nHami threw his hands up. “It’s Espenia,” he exclaimed.\n“They do what they like and why should hypocrisy stand in\ntheir way? They use money and tricky laws like we use the\njade disciplines—as a kind of fighting science. While I was\nthere, I heard a story of a landlord in their country hundreds of\nyears ago who outlawed taking water from a certain river so he\ncould hang the leaders of an entire town. Maybe it’s just a\nmyth, but I would believe it.”\nThere was a knock on Shae’s door. Woon’s secretary\nopened the door partway and put her head inside, bobbing it\napologetically. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but, Woon-jen, your\nwife is on the phone. I told her you were in a meeting with the\nWeather Man, but she insisted I find you.”\nWoon’s face tightened with embarrassment and\nuncharacteristic irritation. “Unless it’s an emergency, tell her\nI’ll call her back,” he said. When his secretary backed away in\nchagrin and closed the door, Woon said to Shae and Hami, “I\napologize.”\n“There’s no need to do so.” Shae glanced at her aide in\nconcern. The brief perturbation in Woon’s expression was\ngone and he seemed fine again, but she was so familiar with\nhis jade aura that she could Perceive the faint static hum of\ndisquiet that had come into it.\n“We were close to finishing anyways,” she said, and turned\nback to Hami. “You’re right to bring this issue up. I agree it’s a\nlong-term problem that we need to address, though one that’s\ntoo big for us to solve today. For now, do you feel like you\nhave what you need to get settled back into Janloon and started\nin your new position, Hamijen?” Out of habit, she addressed\nhim with the respectful Green Bone suffix even though he was\nnot wearing jade, and realizing her error, she amended, a bit\nawkwardly, “It’s your decision, of course, whether to put your\njade back on.” She understood more than anyone that it was a\npersonal choice, one that might be more difficult than other\npeople realized."

I need some time to deal with family things and get\nback into a routine before I’m ready to carry jade again.”\nHami’s family had moved into a new house and Hami’s eldest\nson would soon be entering Kaul Dushuron Academy as a\nyear-one student. “Also, I expect I’ll continue traveling to and\nfrom Port Massy regularly, so to prevent all the legal hassle\nwe’ve discussed, the less green I am, the better, from a\npractical standpoint.”\nStarting today, Hami would be the clan’s Rainmaker—a\nnew and necessary position Shae had created, one that her\nformer Belforte Business School classmates might’ve called a\ndirector of international business development. Hami and a\nfew subordinates would be responsible for improving\ncommunication and coordination between the Janloon office\nand the clan’s Port Massy branch, as well as seeking out\nadditional growth opportunities overseas, something that\nseemed even more important now.\n“You were right, Kaul-jen,” Hami admitted. “Away from\nhome, one gets used to being jadeless, and it’s a strange\nfeeling to come back. In some ways, it’s easier to not be green.\nAs soon as I wear my jade again, I’ll have to return to being a\ncertain type of person.” He snorted and gestured with wry self-\ndeprecation at the extra padding around his middle. “It’ll take\nme months to get back into shape and regain my jade abilities\nafter such an absence.”\n“You’re invaluable to the clan either way, Hami-jen,” Shae\nsaid, using the suffix deliberately this time. “It’s good to have\nyou back home.”\nAfter Hami departed, Woon said, “Do you need anything\nelse from me right now, Shae-jen? Otherwise, I’ll start dealing\nwith Fuyin’s assets like we talked about.”\n“Don’t forget to phone your wife, first,” Shae reminded\nhim as he stood, but the teasing comment failed to elicit even a\nsmall smile. She asked, “Papi-jen … is everything all right?\nYou haven’t been quite yourself this week.” She hadn’t\nintended to bring it up, but the Weather Man’s Shadow had\nseemed unusually tired, and his normally clean-shaven jaw\nwas darkened with faint stubble.\nWoon grimaced and rubbed a hand self-consciously over\nthe side of his face. A throb of unhappiness clouded his aura.\n“I’m sorry, Shaejen. I know I’ve been distracted. I’ll try to do\nbetter.”\n“I didn’t mean it as a criticism.” If Woon’s performance\nhad slipped, she hadn’t noticed at all, and she’d worked with\nhim every day for more than six years. “I’m only asking as a\nfriend. If you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine.” Shae was\nsuddenly worried that she’d spoken clumsily—sounded\nuncaring, or inappropriately caring, too defensive, or too\napologetic."

At work, I can be useful to you and the clan.\nBut Kiya’s been calling me at the office several times a day,\nsometimes angrily. She doesn’t understand that—” He cut\nhimself off with a grimace.\nShae gripped the empty teacup in her hands, then put it\ndown before she could unintentionally break it. Woon worked\nrelentlessly on her behalf. She depended on him more than\nanyone, not only to advance her agenda across the entire\nbusiness side of the clan, but to privately challenge and advise\nher at all times. But she knew it could not be easy for Woon’s\nwife to see so little of him and receive less attention than she\ndeserved because her husband was constantly at the side of\nanother woman, even if that woman was the Weather Man of\nthe clan.\nShae wished she could say something sincere and\nencouraging, but it would be awkward to talk about Kiya. She\nsuspected the woman disliked her. She reached out and\nsqueezed her friend’s arm in what she hoped he would accept\nas a gesture of understanding.\nWoon’s arm tensed under her hand. He lowered himself\nback down into the seat he’d vacated and sat forward with his\nelbows on his knees, studying the floor for a moment before\nreluctantly raising his eyes to hers. When he was concerned or\ndeep in thought, a dimple appeared on the right side of Woon’s\nforehead, one that Shae was often tempted to reach over and\nflatten out with her thumb.\n“Shae-jen … This job … it’s not very good for family life.\nThe Weather Man is always thinking of the clan, and the\nShadow’s first priority is always the Weather Man.” His\nsteadfast jade aura gave a soft, cheerless pulse. “This isn’t the\nway I wanted to bring it up, but it won’t get any easier if I put\nit off. I think it might be time for me to think about moving\ninto another role.”\nShae managed to nod. “Of course, I can understand that.”\nThe words felt stilted as they left her mouth. She couldn’t\npretend to be happy about Woon asking to leave his post. “I’m\nsorry for not realizing that you needed a change. You asked for\none years ago and ended up staying on far longer than I had\nany right to expect of you.”\nWoon’s face colored. “That was … under different\ncircumstances.

Having specific tasks to focus on—securing a\nfake passport and paperwork, collecting information, talking to\nthe right people, planning, getting the boat and equipment—\nkept him from drinking too much and falling into terrible\nmoods. And then, at the end of all the preparation: the surge of\nanticipation and adrenaline, the sharp tang of violent\nsatisfaction. Hilo-jen trusted him above anyone else, gave him\nwork that was difficult and brutal because no one else would\nbe as tenacious, effective, and discreet. This knowledge was a\nlight for Tar even in the darkest of moments.\nTar had been told that during the busy summer months in\nPort Massy, tour boats and private watercraft crowded the\nharbor and went up and down the Camres River, but this late\nin the evening in the off-season, there were no other vessels on\nthe water. Tar stamped his feet and blew into his cupped\nhands, cursing the ridiculous cold as he watched the dim\noutline of the pier recede into the distance. When he could\nbarely see the shore, Tar shouted out to Sammy in the cockpit.\n“We’re far enough out now. Cut the engine.”\nThe motorboat bobbed gently in the dark. Tar went below\ndeck, ducking his head and holding on to the handrail. The\ncabin was lit with two orange overhead lights and the floor\ncovered with black plastic sheeting and drop cloths. In the\ncenter of the room, a man was tied into an aluminum deck\nchair. The first time Tar had laid eyes on Willum “Skinny”\nReams, he’d been wearing a charcoal-gray suit and brimmed\nfelt hat, sitting next to Boss Kromner in Thorick Mansion.\nNow he was shirtless, goosepimples raising the fine dark hairs\nof his chest, his face bruised where he’d been knocked about\nand gagged during transit. His shoes and socks had been\nremoved and his bare toes were curled against the cold.\n“How’s it going down here?” Tar asked."

His shoes and socks had been\nremoved and his bare toes were curled against the cold.\n“How’s it going down here?” Tar asked.\nKuno was kneeling next to a large metal washtub, stirring\nquickdry concrete mix with a small shovel. He sat back on his\nhaunches and wiped a gloved hand over his brow. “This stuff\nwill take longer to dry with it being so cold out,” he said.\n“There’s a space heater in the closet over there. We can\nplug it in.” Tar went himself to take it out and set it up. The\nnight would go faster with more hands to help, but he’d\nbrought only Sammy and Kuno with him. The fewer people\nthe better, as he didn’t know or trust these Kekonese-Espenian\nGreen Bones as much as his own men in Janloon. He\nwould’ve preferred to have Doun or Tyin with him, but it had\nbeen troublesome enough to set up one false identity, and for\nthe sake of minimizing risk and maintaining good relations\nwith Dauk Losunyin, the local Pillar, Kaul Hilo had not\nwanted it to appear as if No Peak was overextending its\nauthority in Port Massy.\nReams looked around the boat room with cold rage and a\ncomplete lack of surprise. “You keck bastards.”\nTar stood in front of the man and looked down at him.\n“Why you end up here? Do you know?” he asked in Espenian.\nTar did not speak the language well, but this was not his first\ntrip to the country. He’d accompanied the Pillar on his initial\nvisit here, over three years ago. Since then, he’d returned a\nfew times on behalf of No Peak, to train the local Green Bones\nand do some work for the clan. He’d learned enough to get by.\nHe didn’t need to talk much.\nSkinny Reams opened his hands, which were bound at the\nwrists to the arms of the chair. “I’ve put my share of men in\nthe river,” he admitted somberly. “God knows there’s no\nshortage of people who’d say I deserve to end up there\nmyself.” He regarded Tar with disgust. “Didn’t think you\nkecks would be the ones to do it, though. You’re sore about\nRohn Toro, but you couldn’t have pulled this off yourself.”\n“Rohn Toro is a reason, yes,” Tar said. Sammy and Kuno\nhad been among Rohn’s friends and protégés in the Keko-\nEspenian Green Bone community; they’d witnessed years of\nbrutal harassment by the Crews against the Kekonese\nneighborhood in Southtrap, and had been the first to arrive on\nthe scene of Rohn’s murder. That was why they were here,\nwith Dauk Losun’s approval, to exact justice. However, Reams\nwas correct: As the new Boss of the Southside Crew, he was\ntoo careful and too well guarded for anyone, even Green\nBones, to have snatched him unawares without inside help.\n“You spennies, though, you are all the same,” Tar said. “Can’t\nbe trusted, not even by each other.”\nKuno turned around from where he was still stirring\nconcrete. He pointed the tip of the hand shovel at the prisoner."

Turning on a fellow crewboy like\nthat, when it’s you ungodly kecks and your poisonous rocks\nthat need to be wiped off the face of the earth.” He spat on the\nfloor of the boat.

Not why I am\nhere.” Tar took off his coat and set it aside. It was getting\nwarmer in the boat now. He rolled up his sleeves and drew the\ntalon knife from the sheath at his waist. “You strangled my\nsister nearly to death. Now she can’t walk or talk right. You\ndon’t know who she is, or who I am, do you? Doesn’t matter.\nAll you should know is this is personal from the No Peak\nclan.”\nSkinny Reams had been a crewboy all his adult life and\nwas considered by everyone in the Port Massy underworld to\nbe as tough as they got, but Tar could Perceive the animal fear\nswelling in him as his eyes traveled up from the edge of the\nhooked blade to the Green Bone’s face, to the stamp of\nmadness there.\n“Kuno, go up to the deck with Sammy,” Tar said, speaking\nin Kekonese now. “I’ll call you back down when I need you.”\nThe younger Green Bone hesitated. “Maik-jen,” he said\nuncertainly, licking his dry lips. “Dauk Losun said we should\nbe quick and careful, the way Rohn-jen always …”\nTar turned his head with a sharp jerk, and the wild light in\nhis dilated pupils along with the knife in his hand convinced\nthe other man to obey without objection. Kuno laid the shovel\ndown, took off his work gloves, and threw a wet drop cloth\nover the metal tub to prevent the concrete from drying.

He was no longer\nWillum Reams, he was no longer anybody, just another enemy\nof the clan, one snaking head of a many-headed beast. The\nclan had numerous enemies and sometimes they blurred\ntogether in Tar’s mind, because in the end they all had one\nterrible thing in common, and so in a way they were all the\nsame.

The entire\nleadership of No Peak would be in attendance, along with the\nmost senior Fists and Luckbringers, prominent Lantern Men,\nand clan-affiliated government officials and public figures.\nWen was busy for weeks ahead of time, drawing up the guest\nlist and making arrangements for food, music, decorations, and\nsecurity. Hilo told her to delegate the work to estate staff and\nhire more help so as not to overtax herself, but she was\ndetermined to maintain oversight of the event. She was afraid\nof something going wrong at a time when the clan could not\nafford any further appearance of weakness.\nOn the evening of the party, her sister-in-law Lina came\nover to the house to help her dress, pin up her hair, and apply\nmakeup. After Kehn’s death, Lina had vacated the Horn’s\nhouse for Juen Nu, moving off the Kaul property and closer to\nher own large family, but she and Wen remained close friends.\n“You look beautiful in lucky green,” Lina said brightly as she\ndid up the buttons on the back of Wen’s dress, perhaps\nnoticing the tightness in her shoulders and neck, the stiff\nanxiety in her set mouth. Wen could hear the rising noise from\nthe courtyard as it began to fill with arriving guests. When she\nlooked out the upstairs window, she could see expensive cars\npulling up in the roundabout, one after the other, bringing men\nin suits and women in gowns.\nHilo came into the room, dressed in a tuxedo. “You’re sure\nyou want to go?” he asked. They had barely spoken in the\nbusy past few weeks. She was often already asleep when he\ngot home. At other times, he went to bed without touching her\nand was gone when she woke up. Now he looked at her\nsteadily for what felt to Wen like the first time in months. His\nexpression softened. “You don’t have to. It’s fine.”\nWen smiled weakly. “You know it’s … not fine.” It was\noften difficult for her to put her trapped thoughts into words or\nto make those words come out smoothly and correctly, but she\nwas perfectly capable of listening to the news and hearing the\ntalk in the clan. The treason and public execution of a Green\nBone Lantern Man was uncommon and much discussed, and\nthe recent attack on the Double Double casino had prompted\nconcern of additional stunts by fringe anti-clan extremists\nduring the holidays.

It\nwas not a good image at a time when fears were running high\nthat Kekon could become the next hotspot in the global\nconflict between Espenia and Ygutan. Meanwhile, the\nMountain clan seemed flush with cash and its members were\npleased that Ayt Mada had positioned her teenage nephew as\nher heir. Their enemies were spending lavishly on their own\nNew Year’s celebrations.\nShe walked toward Hilo and he offered her his arm. She\nheld on to it, steadying herself and feeling shorter than usual\nnext to him without high heels, which were impossible for her\nnow. “Don’t … let me f-fall,” she said. Tonight was about\nappearances. The Kaul family needed to put on its strongest\nand most unified face. As the wife of the Pillar, Wen was\nexpected to be the hostess tonight. Her absence would only be\nseen as proof of her infirmity. Hilo said nothing, but walked\npatiently with her as they went down the stairs, positioning her\nstronger left side by the railing so she could step down with\nher weaker leg first, one step at a time.\n“Today’s … our wedding anniversary. Remember?” she\nasked him, slowing down the enunciation of her words to\navoid slurring them. They had been married on New Year’s\nEve, the day before Hilo had gone to save the clan by facing a\ndeath of consequence.\n“Sure,” he said, not unkindly, but the casual curtness of the\nsingleword answer made Wen bite her lip. Her husband’s\nmoments of outright cruelty were infrequent and brief—a cold\nlook, a cutting remark, a flash of hurt or anger in response to\nany reminder of her past dishonesty and how she’d nearly\nbeen killed because of it. Each one felt corrosive on her soul,\nbut far worse was the deliberate distance he’d placed between\nthem. Having lived so long in the uncompromising sunlight of\nHilo’s love, the absence of his affection was a lifeless and\nunending winter.\nWen had assumed this would happen eventually—he\nwould find out how deeply and for how long she’d been\ngetting involved in clan affairs behind his back and against his\nwishes, using her deficiency as a stone-eye to move jade,\nputting her own life at risk. Of course he would be angry, but\nshe’d counted on being able to explain herself, to talk to Hilo\nin the way she’d always been able, to reassure and calm him\nso that he would come to understand, as she was certain he\neventually would.\nShe had not gotten that chance. At the time she most\nneeded to communicate, she’d been barely able to express\nherself, struggling to even string a few words together\ncoherently. And Hilo—if only he’d been able to rage at her, to\ngive free rein to his hurt and sense of betrayal, he might’ve\nburned away some of the force of his feeling. But the shock of\nher near death and her need for care meant he hadn’t been able\nto do that.\nAt the bottom of the stairs, Wen paused to take a deep\nbreath and ready herself.

Hilo put his hand on the small of her\nback and she rested briefly against the gentle pressure. They\nwent together out into the courtyard to face the clan.\nA wave of clasped hands rising to foreheads in salute and\nshouts of “Kaul-jen! Our blood for the Pillar!” greeted them as\nsoon as they stepped outside. Wen swallowed and forced a\nwelcoming smile toward the sea of faces—important people\nfrom every part of the clan seeing her by the Pillar’s side for\nthe first time in more than a year and a half. She began to\ntighten her grip on Hilo’s arm, but restrained herself, not\nwanting to appear as if she were clinging to him for balance.\nHilo raised his voice and his free arm high in\nacknowledgment, calling out to the crowd, “Brothers and\nsisters, my order as Pillar tonight is that you’d better eat all\nthis food and finish those casks of hoji!” Laughter, followed\nby someone, probably a Fist who’d already had too much to\ndrink, yelling cheerfully, “I am ready to die for the clan!” Wen\ncaught a glimpse of Shae, in a conservative but flattering black\ndress, rolling her eyes and taking a drink from her glass of\nwine.\nOrdinarily, they would walk around the festively decorated\ncourtyard, greeting clan members and accepting their respect-\npaying, but tonight Hilo led Wen to the main table and helped\nher into her chair. He took his seat next to her and remained\nthere as guests came by in small groups to speak to him. He\nseemed to everyone to be in a good mood, attentive, smiling in\nhis usual relaxed way.\nWen returned well wishes, nodding and smiling more than\nspeaking. Every time she opened her mouth she feared she\nwould make a mistake. She used to possess a nearly perfect\nmemory for faces and names, a skill that had served her well\nin every social situation, but she had lost that as well. Just get\nthrough this, she told herself.\nThe cold spell had lifted, but it was still uncommonly\nchilly for what was supposed to be the start of spring. Women\npulled shawls over bare shoulders, and evenly spaced gas\nlanterns cast warmth and flickering firelight shadows against\nthe erected red canopies sheltering the tables. The children\nwere brought out by their grandmother right before dinner was\nserved—Niko and Ru in little suits and ties, Jaya in a yellow\ndress and white tights that she’d somehow already managed to\nstain at the knees. She ran ahead of her brothers and tried to\nclimb into Wen’s lap and onto the table. “Jaya-se, sit down\nproperly,” Wen scolded, struggling to wrangle her youngest\nand breathing a sigh of relief when Lina took the toddler to\nplay on the swing set on the garden lawn with her little cousin\nCam.\n“You’re looking well, Mrs. Kaul,” said Woon’s wife,\ncoming over to sit next to Wen while her husband was\nengaged in conversation with a handful of senior\nLuckbringers. “I pray the gods favor you with good health this\nyear.”\n“Thank you … Kiya,” Wen said, relieved she remembered"

Her words came out slow but otherwise\nnormal. “I hope … the same for you.”\nThe woman’s smile faltered for a moment but she pulled it\nback into place and nodded over at Hilo, who was walking\naround with Niko and Ru, proudly letting people exclaim over\nthem and indulging Ru’s talkativeness. He gave each boy a\nbag of candy coins and sent them off with the mission to hand\nthem out to all the other youngsters. “You have beautiful\nchildren,” Kiya said to Wen with a wistful smile. “You must be\nvery proud about the future of the clan.”\nWen wondered how much Woon Papi told his wife when it\ncame to clan affairs, whether she knew how much financial\nstrain No Peak was under. “The future of … the clan,” she\nreminded Kiya, nodding to the huge party, “is bigger than\nthat.”\nAnyone observing the large and well-dressed crowd\ntonight, the overflowing food and hoji, the gleam of jade on\nhundreds of wrists and necks, would think the No Peak clan\nwas invincible. That was by design. There was an art to\nshaping people’s impressions—a small room could be made to\nseem big, flaws in a house could be transformed into assets.\nOn this night, she’d made No Peak seem too wealthy and\npowerful to fall. Reality was more complicated. Wen had seen\nnewspaper photographs of the graffitied proclamation on the\nglass doors of the Double Double. Although she knew no one\nwould dare attack such a large gathering of Green Bones,\nespecially on the eve of a holiday, her eyes searched out the\nfigures of the guards standing watch by the estate’s brick walls\nand iron gates. No one was guaranteed anything—not them,\nnot their enemies.\nShae came over to take her spot at the head table as the\nwaiters began to bring out the main courses. Kiya stood\nbriskly. “I’d better collect my husband and get back to our\nown seats,” she announced, and pulled insistently on Woon\nPapi’s arm, leading him away. Juen Nu and his wife claimed\ntheir places next to Hilo. Tar, who’d recently returned from a\ntrip to Espenia, arrived with his lover, Iyn Ro. Both of them\nseemed to be several glasses of hoji into the party and were\nhanging on to each other, laughing loudly. Anden quietly took\nthe seat next to Wen, letting out a relieved breath and giving\nher a small smile. “I’m glad I’m sitting next to you, sister\nWen.”\nWen was glad to be sitting next to Anden as well. He alone\nunderstood what she’d been through on that horrible night in\nPort Massy. He’d confided that he too sometimes woke\nthrashing from nightmares in which he couldn’t breathe. She\nowed Anden her life, but he was still the unassuming young\nman she’d always known. When her words stuck or slurred, he\nnever looked at her with pity or impatience.

All the strain she\nfelt while trying to talk to the other guests vanished, and\nironically, when she was relaxed, she had barely any trouble.\n“How’s medical school?”\n“It’s a lot of work,” he said ruefully, but didn’t offer\nfurther complaint.\nWen tried to encourage him. “I’ve heard the first year is\nthe hardest.”\nAnden nodded. “There’s so much material in the first year,\nand you have to learn to think of jade abilities in a completely\ndifferent way. I hope this next year will be a little easier.” He\nsaw Wen hesitating to pick up the soup ladle and reached for it\nhimself, spooning the seafood soup into a bowl for her.\n“Sometimes, I wonder if it’s worth it,” he admitted, “but if I\nfail at this, there’s nothing else I can do that’ll be of any use.”\n“Anden,” Wen said sternly, “you sh-shouldn’t say that.\nThink about what you did even while living with … with …\nwithout jade in a foreign country. Growing up, everyone made\nyou think your worth was about jade ability, when it’s … it’s\nobviously because of who you are as a person. Your cousins\nknow that by now, even if you were to drop out of medical\nschool tomorrow.” She was so adamant about making her\npoint that she barely noticed the triumph of speaking several\nsentences together with so few stumbles.\nAnden flushed and seemed suddenly engrossed in pushing\nthe shrimp on his plate around in a puddle of garlic sauce.\n“Thank you for saying so,” he said after a moment. “I hope\nyou’re right.”\n“Of course I’m right.” Wen could understand why the\nyoung man might be feeling uncertain tonight. Anden’s place\nat the head table confirmed to everyone that the Pillar had\nbrought his previously disgraced cousin back into the family,\nbut that didn’t mean the heavily jaded warriors and wealthy\nbusinessmen of the clan weren’t eyeing him with pity and\nskepticism. As much pity and skepticism as they likely felt\ntoward her, Wen thought. So much bad luck near the top, they\nwould murmur.\nHilo’s joking orders notwithstanding, it seemed food\ncontinued to arrive at a rate faster than it could be consumed.\nThe tables were laden with roast suckling pig, steamed fish in\nginger broth, pea shoots with garlic, fried octopus. A band of\nhired drummers escorted the previous year out with\nthunderous energy, and two adjacent tables of Fists challenged\neach other to a drinking game. Niko, Ru, and Jaya came over\nto hug their parents good night before Hilo’s mother took them\ninside and put them to bed. A veil of exhaustion was\ndescending over Wen’s vision, turning everything gauzy,\nseeping into each muscle and gumming up her thoughts.\nShe noticed that Juen and his wife had left the table some\ntime ago, but now the Horn appeared behind Wen’s chair and\nleaned over to speak to Hilo. “Kaul-jen. My wife went back to\nour house to put the kids to bed, but she rushed back to tell me\nthe news that’s on the radio.” He spoke near the Pillar’s ear,"

        "text": "our house to put the kids to bed, but she rushed back to tell me\nthe news that’s on the radio.” He spoke near the Pillar’s ear,\nbut had to raise his voice enough over the sound of popping\nfirecrackers that Wen could still hear him. “An Ygutanian spy\nplane was shot down by Espenian fighter craft over Euman\nIsland two hours ago. It crashed near the naval base. The pilot\nsurvived the landing but killed himself before he could be\ncaptured. The Ygutanian and Espenian governments are\nthrowing accusations at each other over the incident and\nthreatening war in the Amaric.”\nAs Juen spoke, Hilo’s expression did not change much\noutwardly, but Wen saw the light in his eyes shift from relaxed\ngood humor to disbelief to anger in a few seconds, like a flame\nturning from red to orange to blue. “Of all the fucking times,”\nhe breathed through his teeth.\n“The Royal Council is meeting in an emergency session\ntomorrow.” Juen looked at the exuberant party in progress.\nThe drummers had begun a countdown to midnight and\nanother cask of hoji was opened. Even Shae seemed to be\nhaving a good time. “Should we tell people?” the Horn asked.\nThe muscles of Hilo’s jaw flexed under the skin. “No,” he\nsaid. “They’ll find out soon enough. Let everyone start the\nNew Year in a good mood.” He muttered darkly, “It might be\nthe only chance we have to call down good luck, and we’re\ngoing to fucking need it.”\n“I’ll speak quietly only to the senior Fists, then,” Juen\nsuggested. “So they’re ready to keep order in our territories if\npeople start panicking about an invasion.”\nWhen the Horn departed, Wen reached for her husband’s\narm. She intended to say, “You need to talk to Shae tonight,\ntoo. The Weather Man’s office should align with our loyalists\nin the Royal Council before anyone makes a statement.”\nInstead, her elbow knocked over a full cup of tea, spilling it\nacross both their laps. When she opened her mouth, nothing\ncame out—she felt as if the words had been shoved back down\ninto her chest. She could only look up at Hilo helplessly.\nHilo used a napkin to blot up the tea soaking into their\nclothes. “You’re tired.” He stood and drew Wen to her feet.\nShe leaned against him as they made their way back to the\nhouse. For the moment, no one was paying attention to them.\nNearly all the guests had migrated to the lawn to wait for the\ndisplay of fireworks that would soon go off over the city. Once\ninside, Hilo helped her up the stairs and into bed. His hands\nwere gentle but empty of affection or lust as he unbuttoned her\nelaborate gown and removed it before tucking her under the\nblankets.\nTears of regret and humiliation stung the back of Wen’s\neyes. Years ago, when they were young lovers, she used to\nspend the entire day in feverish anticipation of Hilo’s arrival.\nHe would come to her at last, a young Fist burning bright with\nthe high of new jade taken in some skirmish or duel.

She’d\nsmelled perfume on his clothes a few times, had found\nmatchbooks and mint wrappers from the Lilac Divine\nGentleman’s Club in his pockets. She could accept that he paid\nto have his needs met elsewhere during her long recuperation,\nbut it was too painful to imagine, as she did now, that they’d\nlost the ability to find solace in each other. On the occasions\nthey attempted lovemaking, Hilo was not himself, either\nhandling her with extreme care, as if afraid of damaging her,\nor else copulating brusquely, as if engaged in an angry chore.\nHilo turned off the bedside lamp and sat down on the edge\nof the mattress, staring out the window at the city skyline as\nthe first fireworks exploded high over the roofline of Wisdom\nHall and the tiered conical tower of the Triumphal Palace. The\nflashes of light briefly illuminated his darkened profile,\nsharpened the pensive lines that did not fit on the face she’d\nfallen in love with. Outside, the drums boomed and the people\nat the party cheered the arrival of the New Year.\nWhen Wen was seventeen years old, she’d sharpened a\nkitchen knife and slashed the tires on her brother’s bicycle.\nShe never told Kehn, who gave one of the neighbor boys a\nbeating over it.

Hilo once laughed as he\npulled up to see her standing in the rain. He said she was the\nkindest and most devoted sister he’d ever met, that his own\nsister would never do such a thing.\nWen had to admit with some chagrin that she had been a\nlovesick teenage girl, but she hadn’t simply pined uselessly. A\nsmall thing like a ruined bicycle could change fate, just as a\nstone-eye could tip the scales in a clan war. She searched now\nfor the one thing she could say that would make Hilo turn\ntoward her, the way he used to when he rolled down the\nwindow and leaned across the seat with a grin. But she was too\nweary.\n“I have to go back out there,” Hilo said. Wen turned onto\nher side.

After much political outrage and\ntense military posturing on all sides, the diplomatic crisis\nbetween Espenia and Ygutan had not escalated into all-out\nwar, but in Janloon and other cities across Kekon, there had\nbeen panicked runs on groceries and basic supplies at a time\nthat would normally be a period of rest and celebration. The\nGreen Bone clans had been out in force preventing crime and\nlooting in their own districts, but that was a short-term\nconcern. The Kekonese people were contemplating the\npossibility of foreign invasion for the first time since the Many\nNations War. Even clan leaders that hated each other knew\nthey needed to meet.\nShae went over to the main house early that morning and\nfound the children watching cartoons while Kyanla cleaned up\nafter breakfast. “Auntie Shae, we’re watching Beast Taming\nWarriors,” Ru informed her, pulling her toward the sofa. An\nanimated show about Green Bone royal guards of a fictitious\npseudo Three Crowns–era dynasty, who not only had\nfantastically overpowered jade abilities but who could\nsummon and ride enormous magical beasts into battle. A\nnumber of action figures of the show’s characters were\nscattered on the carpet in front of the television.\nShae sat down on the sofa to appease her nephew.\n“Where’s your da?”\nRu shrugged, but Niko said, with sudden worry, “Do you\nthink he’ll divorce Ma?”\nShae was taken aback by the six-year-old’s question,\ncoming seemingly out of nowhere, but before she could think\nof how to respond, Ru jumped on his brother and began hitting\nhim in the shoulders and stomach. “Stop saying that! They’re\nnot getting divorced, you stupid dogface!” Jaya toddled over,\ngiggling curiously.\nNiko shoved his little brother aside impatiently without\nhitting back, and Shae separated the boys to opposite sides of\nthe sofa. “Ru, you shouldn’t use words like dogface,” she told\nhim. Hilo came down the stairs, glanced briefly at the sullen\nscene, and said, “Turn off the TV, you should be getting\ndressed for school.” He strode for the door. Shae followed\nhim.\nA trusted driver took them downtown in the Duchesse.\nHilo lit a cigarette and rolled down the back seat window.\nShae forced herself to break the thick silence that now\nseemed to descend every time she was alone with her brother.\n“The boys are worried about you and Wen.”\nHilo said, “Niko worries too much. Who’s ever met a kid\nlike that?”\n“It’s because he pays attention,” Shae said. The boy often\nseemed inattentive, lost in his own thoughts, but then he would\nsay something that made it clear he overheard a great deal of\nwhat the adults discussed. “He knows you treat Wen\ndifferently now.”\n“I treat her just fine,” Hilo snapped. “I’ve always taken\ncare of her.”\nShae wanted to smack her brother.

She and Hilo had hurt\neach other enough in their lives that she was well fortified\nagainst his anger, but that was not the case for her sister-in-\nlaw, who was one of the strongest-minded women she knew\nbut who lived on Hilo’s love like oxygen. “If you have to keep\nblaming me, go ahead. But hasn’t Wen been through enough\nalready? Everything she did, she did for you and the clan.\nCan’t you even bring yourself to tell her that you understand\nthat?”\nHilo snorted as he ground his cigarette out violently in the\ncar’s ashtray. “You’re the last person on earth qualified to give\nrelationship advice, Shae. What about you and Woon?”\nThe sudden reversal caught Shae off guard as completely\nas the swift parry and reversal of a blade attack. “What about\nme and Woon?” she demanded, inwardly cringing at the\ndefensiveness in her voice. “We’re colleagues and good\nfriends.”\nHilo’s laugh was cruel. “And you think I’m the one not\nsaying what needs to be said? Woon’s smart in other ways, but\nI don’t know why he tortures himself working for you. You\nshould’ve told him how you really feel, or fired him already.”\nShae’s face grew hot. She forgot that she’d begun this\nconversation about Wen. “Not all of us spew our feelings out\nlike shrapnel, Hilo,” she exclaimed. “Woon and I are\nprofessionals, and besides, he’s moving into another role next\nweek.”\n“And why do you think he needed to ask for that?” Hilo\nsaid. Before Shae could reply, the Duchesse pulled up at their\ndestination. “Forget it. Just concentrate on not letting Ayt\nMada and every other Pillar in the room see what a mess we\nare.” Hilo pushed open the door and got out of the car, leaving\nher fuming that he’d managed to get the last word. She forced\nout a noisy breath, then stepped out after him.\nThe Kekon Jade Alliance was headquartered in a three-\nstory concrete block of an office building in the Financial\nDistrict, within walking distance of the clan’s office tower on\nShip Street to the east and the Temple of Divine Return two\nblocks to the west. Its blunt, heavy appearance radiated\ngovernment bureaucracy and never failed to remind Shae that\nfor all the cultural, economic, and spiritual significance of\njade, its production and distribution required thousands of\npeople doing mundane work in cubicles.

The boardroom’s massive circular table had\nassigned places and name plaques for each representative of\nthe fifteen Green Bone clans that currently comprised the\nshareholder body of Kekon’s national jade cartel. The\narrangement suggested that every Green Bone clan was equal\nin this room, that they all shared responsibility for\nsafeguarding and managing the country’s jade supply.\nNevertheless, the Mountain and No Peak, by far the two\nlargest clans in the country, were positioned directly across\nfrom each other, with representatives of the minor clans seated\ncloser or farther to one side or the other depending on their\nrespective loyalties. Whoever had optimistically designed the\nroom to promote a sense of egalitarian cooperation, Shae\nmused wryly, had underestimated the Kekonese propensity to\nsignal status and allegiance at every opportunity. Four Deitist\npenitents in traditional long green robes stood silently against\nthe walls, ensuring communication with Heaven and ensuring\ngood behavior between the clans even in this most officious of\nconflict zones.\nHilo nodded in greeting to the leaders of the tributary\nStone Cup and Jo Sun clans, who saluted him as he dropped\ninto his seat. Shae lowered herself into the chair next to him\nand tried to look elsewhere, busying herself by taking out\nunnecessary papers, but her gaze was nevertheless drawn\nunwillingly across the table, to the disfigurement of Ayt\nMada’s partially missing left ear. The old scar across Shae’s\nabdomen prickled. The Pillar of the Mountain glanced in\nShae’s direction. Their eyes met for one wintry second. Then\nAyt turned back to her conversation.\nOrdinarily, the seat to Ayt’s left would be occupied by Iwe\nKalundo, the Weather Man of the Mountain, but sitting in\nIwe’s place today was a barrel-chested man with graying\nbushy hair combed back from a ruddy complexion. He wore\njade around his left wrist and in his right ear, and his\nexpansive jade aura felt thick and syrupy to Shae’s Perception.\nHe seemed vaguely familiar; who was he? Why was he here\ninstead of Iwe? If Ayt had replaced her Weather Man, she\nwould’ve heard of it.\n“He’s one of the Kobens,” Hilo said in an undertone,\napparently noticing her confusion. “The kid’s uncle on his\nma’s side.” He meant the uncle of Koben Ato, the fourteen-\nyear-old ward and presumed heir to Ayt Mada. The boy had\nrecently changed his name back to Ayt Ato, no doubt so his\nfamily could cement that presumption. Shae recalled now that\nshe’d seen a recent magazine profile of the Koben family, but\nshe was surprised Hilo would recognize them. Then she\nremembered that a few years ago, Hilo had stoked infighting\nwithin the Mountain clan by ordering one of the Kobens\nsecretly assassinated, so of course he’d studied them.\nWas Koben’s presence further evidence of Ayt elevating\nher nephew and his family? Perhaps, after years of being\ndogged by the question of succession, she wished to publicly\nsignal that she was indeed planning for her clan’s future."

        "text": "her nephew and his family? Perhaps, after years of being\ndogged by the question of succession, she wished to publicly\nsignal that she was indeed planning for her clan’s future.\nHilo and Shae were among the last to arrive. In minutes,\nthe seats were full and the heavy doors were shut. Floor-to-\nceiling windows on one side of the room faced south, letting in\nample sunlight, but the air in the room felt clogged with jade\nenergy. KJA meetings were held every quarter, but most clan\nPillars attended only the annual vote that determined the KJA\nbudget and set quotas for jade production, export, and\nallocation. They left the other meetings to their Weather Men.\nIt was only under unusual circumstances that all the clan\nleaders had gathered on such short notice.\nNot everyone present at the table was a Green Bone.\nAlthough the clans were controlling stakeholders, the cartel\nwas state run and managed, so there were always other\ndirectors and government officials in attendance, along with\ntheir aides. One of the jadeless officials, the chief operating\nofficer of the KJA and current chair of the board, Canto Pan,\nstood up and spoke. “Thank you, everyone, for interrupting\nyour holiday week to be here. May the gods shine favor on\neach of your clans.” That was patently impossible, Shae\nthought, since any divine favor shown to the Mountain would\nbe disaster for No Peak and vice versa, but she kept the\nthought to herself.\n“As you all know by now, the Royal Council has issued a\nstatement that has been publicly supported by every Green\nBone clan in the country,” Canto said.\nThe Kekonese government had strongly condemned\nYgutan for sending spy planes over Euman Island, which it\nunequivocally reiterated was Kekonese territory despite the\nlong-standing presence of foreign military “guests.” It urged a\nreduction in conflict between the two powers through\ndiplomatic channels, but also promised that any attempt by\neither side to invade or control Kekon would be met with swift\nand overwhelming resistance. “While Kekon wishes for peace,\nwe remain a nation of warriors unlike any other in the world,”\nChancellor Guim, a Mountain clan loyalist, had declared on\nthe floor of Wisdom Hall. “Throughout our long and proud\nhistory, we’ve shed rivers of blood for our independence. We\nare more than capable of doing so again.”\nThe Espenian government had not been pleased by the\nharsh tone of an official speech that was, as Hilo put it, “A\nlong-winded, pretty way of saying fuck both of you.”\nChairman Canto said, “We all stand behind the\nchancellor’s words, but the fearful public reaction we’ve seen\nin the past few days proves that we have to do more than voice\nsupport. With that in mind, I turn the floor over to General\nRonu Yasugon, senior military advisor to the Royal Council,\nwho has asked to speak to you directly.”\nRonu stood and touched his clasped hands to his forehead\nin salute to all the Green Bone leaders. He wore gold general’s\nstripes on the sleeve of his uniform and jade stones in the steel\nband of his wristwatch. Shae had met the general before and\nthought he must be an honorable man with a difficult job,\nhaving long ago traded his status in the Mountain clan for a"

Shae had met the general before and\nthought he must be an honorable man with a difficult job,\nhaving long ago traded his status in the Mountain clan for a\ncareer in the small and underappreciated Kekonese army.\n“The Kekonese people were forced to confront reality this\nweek—a reality that military commanders have been pointing\nout for years.” Ronu stood stiffly as he spoke, hands at his\nsides. “We are a small country caught between two tigers. For\nall of Chancellor Guim’s outward confidence that we can resist\nforeign aggression, the truth is that our modest defense forces\nwould be swiftly and easily overrun. Espenia and Ygutan\nescalate their military spending every year, but we continue to\ntreat our own armed services as a low priority. Yesterday, I\nstood in front of the Royal Council and urged them to pass an\nemergency funding bill that would provide much-needed\nequipment, training, and personnel to rapidly improve our\nmilitary readiness.”\n“We can’t outspend countries that are so much larger than\nours,” pointed out Sangun Yen, the elderly but sharp-minded\nPillar of the Jo Sun clan. “Our national security has always\ndepended on a general citizenry populated with trained jade\nwarriors who are ready to fight. The Green Bone clans see to\nthat.”\n“Nearly a century ago, that ancient wisdom failed against\nthe might of overwhelming force, resulting in decades of\nShotarian occupation,” Ronu pointed out.\n“We had a meek and cowardly king at that time, and too\nmany small, uncoordinated clans,” Sangun countered. “It was\na dark period in our history, yet nevertheless, we overthrew the\ninvaders. Despite all their sword rattling, would any country\ntoday, even a large and powerful one like Ygutan, be so\nfoolhardy as to risk an invasion of Kekon? They had difficulty\nenough in Oortoko, a place with only weak people. We\nshouldn’t let this fuss over the spy plane turn into alarmism.”\nSangun’s son, the Weather Man of their clan, nodded in\nagreement, as did several other Green Bones. Shae had read\nthe opinions of numerous political and military analysts,\nnearly all of them agreeing that while Kekon was vital to\nEspenian interests in the Amaric, and thus a logical target for\nYgutanian aggression, the cost of invading and holding the\nhistorically impregnable island was simply too high to be\nworth it.\nGeneral Ronu said, “The clans may have grown larger and\nstronger, but we’re facing a far different world than our\ngrandparents did. We’re no longer the only nation with jade\nwarriors. The Republic of Espenia equips its own elite soldiers\nwith jade that we sell to them under the auspices of the KJA.\nJade on the black market reaches Ygutan and its vassal states.\nAn improved formulation of SN1 that carries less severe\nhealth risks has been in development for some time. The\nEspenians are calling it SN2, and it will no doubt find its way\ninto the wider world as well.”\nShae noticed that on the other side of the table, the man\nfrom the Koben family was nodding vigorously and looked as\nif he wanted to jump out of his seat to agree."

        "text": "into the wider world as well.”\nShae noticed that on the other side of the table, the man\nfrom the Koben family was nodding vigorously and looked as\nif he wanted to jump out of his seat to agree.\nRonu’s jade aura sharpened, thickening at the edges as he\nspoke with urgent conviction. “Oortoko was only the first of\nthe proxy conflicts between the Espenosphere and the Ygut\ncoalition. Kekon cannot escape being caught up in the Slow\nWar. Unlike any other time in history, we have to prepare for\nthe possibility of facing foreign soldiers who can use jade as\nwell as we do.”\nThe general’s grim pronouncements elicited vexed\nmurmurs from around the table. Despite accepting the revenue\nfrom KJA-controlled jade exports without much complaint, at\nheart, the Kekonese disdain the idea of other races using jade.\nThey console themselves with the knowledge that they remain\nbetter at it than anyone else, and that foreigners who wear jade\nmust use addictive drugs and risk an early death.\nRonu could see that he’d struck a nerve. He raised a hand\nand plowed onward. “The Royal Council can commit to an\nincrease in money and equipment, but only the Green Bone\nclans can provide jade and warriors. I ask you, as the\nshareholders of the KJA and the Pillars of your clans, to make\na bold show of support for the Kekonese military. We\ncurrently receive less than four percent of annual jade\nproduction. Announce a special allocation to increase that to\nsix and a half percent, effective this year. And lift the\nlongstanding barriers to recruitment by allowing graduates of\nmartial schools to enlist in the military immediately after\ngraduation.”\nA wave of muted muttering accompanied the prickly\nswelling of dozens of jade auras. It was a bold request, thus far\nunheard of. Granting it would elevate Kekon’s tiny military to\na status approaching that of the Green Bone clans. “Six and a\nhalf percent of the nation’s jade is more than most clans at this\ntable receive, and more than the allocation given to major\ninstitutions in healthcare and education,” protested the Pillar of\nthe Stone Cup clan. “Who do you propose we take from to\ngive to the army?”\n“I’m more concerned about this recruitment plan,” said\nDurn Soshu, the Pillar of the Black Tail clan. “It’s always been\ntraditional for graduates to swear oaths to their clan. A year or\ntwo spent as a Finger is the best thing for all young people.”\nThis time, there were many nods of agreement, although Shae\nknew the argument was not really about tradition or the well-\nbeing of youth. It was by design that the clans took all the jade\ntalent straight out of schools for their own ranks, with\nexceptions made only for the noble professions of medicine,\nteaching, and religious penitence.\nGeneral Ronu stood with his shoulders back and his\nexpression firm, having clearly anticipated the skepticism he\nwould face. “Unfortunately, that tradition is part of the\nproblem, Durn-jen,” he said. “Green Bones in the national\nmilitary arrive as recruits with different amounts of jade—\ngranted at graduation, passed down from families, or earned in\nthe clan.

They’ve been steeped in clan culture and carry those\nallegiances into their units. They expect to be able to wear jade\nhowever they like and to win more by challenging their fellow\nsoldiers. It’s hard to train them to prioritize corps above clan,\nto value squad cohesion over individual prowess. I’m speaking\nas someone who once had to go through that transition myself.\nTo be frank, Green Bones raised and trained in a major clan\nmake excellent fighters, but poor soldiers.\n“When I enlisted twenty years ago, I was met with\ndisbelief and disapproval from my family and fellow Green\nBones,” Ronu went on. “As a mid-rank Fist, I was told by\neveryone that I was taking a step backward. That attitude has\nbarely shifted in over two decades. I’m asking you to help me\nchange that. By permitting graduates of the martial schools to\nenlist in the military before becoming set in clan ways, you\nwould send the needed message that it’s as respectable and\nhonorable to serve the country in uniform as it is to swear\noaths of brotherhood to a clan.”\nShae scrawled rapidly on her notepad. We need to run the\nnumbers on impact to both sides of the clan. Suggest delaying\nvote until next quarterly meeting. She pushed the note in front\nof Hilo. He glanced down at it, but the Pillar of the Six Hands\nUnity clan spoke up first. “General Ronu is proposing a\nconsequential change that we need time to fully consider. We\nought to let each clan discuss the issue among its leaders and\nwith its allies, and we can reconvene in a month or so.”\nChairman Canto began to stand back up. “That sounds\nreasona—”\n“Surely, if there was ever a time to act decisively to\nreassure the public of our national unity, it would be now.” Ayt\nMada’s voice interrupted the chairman mid-sentence and mid-\nmotion. Every pair of eyes in the room pivoted toward her. “I\nagree completely with General Ronu that the Kekonese\nmilitary ought to be accorded more jade, more people, and\nmore respect.”\nUp until now, neither Ayt Mada nor Kaul Hilo had said\nanything. As the Pillars of the two largest clans, their opinions\nmattered the most and all decisions made in this room would\nultimately come down to them. It was typical for experts,\nofficials, and the leaders of the minor clans to speak first if\nthey had anything to say or wished to exert any influence on\nAyt or Kaul. It would not have been any surprise if the\nmeeting had adjourned with neither of them yet declaring a\nposition. No one had expected Ayt Madashi to weigh in so\nquickly.\n“Since my Weather Man is out of the country on important\nclan business and could not be here today, I’ve brought Koben\nYiro with me,” Ayt said. “Koben-jen is a successful\nbusinessman who owns a number of radio stations and also\nhas relatives in the military, so he has a better understanding\nthan most of us when it comes to the concerns of ordinary\ncivilians and soldiers at this anxious time.”\nWith his Pillar’s permission, Koben jumped into the"

Like all hardworking and patriotic Kekonese, we\ncare most for the safety of our families, our livelihoods, and\nour cultural traditions. What happened on New Year’s Eve has\nstirred hate for Ygutan, but the ROE presence that has loomed\nover the country for so long can’t be trusted either. In the end,\nwe can rely only on ourselves.” Koben grew impassioned and\njabbed a finger in the air. “That’s why people are looking to\nthe Green Bone clans they trust, hoping for a swift and strong\nmessage of resolve.”\nAyt made a small motion with her hand, quieting the\nanimated Koben, who looked as if he could go on, but checked\nhimself and settled back in his seat at once. “We should set an\nexample for the Royal Council by acting unhesitatingly,” Ayt\ndeclared with crisp authority. “As Pillar of the Mountain, I\nsupport increasing the allocation of jade to the armed forces so\nlong as the redistribution is done fairly, and I agree that\nnational military service should be among the choices Green\nBones have directly upon graduation.” She paused, then\nadded, almost as an afterthought, “That is, if my fellow Pillars\nagree. This is such a substantial change that we shouldn’t\nenact it unless we’re all of the same mind.”\nNo one answered her. Even General Ronu seemed to be\nstunned to have Ayt Madashi’s immediate and unequivocal\nsupport. Every head in the room now swung toward Hilo,\nsitting partly slouched directly across from his rival. Shae\nscribbled urgently on the notepad between them: STALL.\n“No.” Hilo’s answer landed with the weight of a boulder\ndropped into the middle of a stream. “I’m okay with Ronu\ngetting the jade he’s asked for. We can take most of it out of\nwhat we’ve been giving to the temples—how much jade do\nthe penitents really need to talk to the gods anyway?—and the\nrest from the national treasury. But I won’t change the way the\ngraduates of Kaul Dushuron Academy take their oaths. If you\nwant to do things differently at Wie Lon Temple School, that’s\nyour decision.”\nAyt Mada didn’t miss a beat. “Surely, Kaul-jen, we should\nact in a unified and selfless way at this time,” she said with\ncalculating righteousness. “It’s only right that the two clans\nwith the most jade and people should give some of what we\nhave.”\n“The military is one arm of the country. The clans are the\nspine.” Hilo’s eyes narrowed as he fixed his gaze across the\ntable. “And not every clan has resources to spare after glutting\nitself with barukan recruits and black market profits.”\nThe dense blanket of jade auras shifted apprehensively as"

It seems\nthe KJA is not able to support your commendable efforts at\nmilitary reform, General. Not unless No Peak is willing to\nreconsider.”\nShae understood now why Ayt had agreed to Ronu’s\nrequest so quickly and with no apparent doubt. The Mountain\ncould afford to lose some Fingers to the military. No Peak\ncould not. Any loss of warriors meant it would be less able to\nprotect its properties from criminals and anti-clan agitators, or\ndefend its territorial borders against the Mountain’s recently\nincreased numbers. No Peak was already falling behind\nfinancially, and any further loss of confidence on the part of its\nLantern Men would accelerate its ruin.\nAyt knew that No Peak would have to veto Ronu’s\nproposal, so the measure was certain to fail. She’d seized the\nopportunity to position herself and the supportive Koben\nfamily as leaders with Kekon’s best interests at heart, while\nonce again casting No Peak as self-serving and unpatriotic—\nby now, an old and reliable attack against them that she was\nnot going to abandon.\nUnderneath the table, Shae bent the pen in her hand so\nhard it snapped into plastic shards. She was enraged by Ayt’s\nunrelenting traps—and furious at Hilo. As he had in the Twice\nLucky with Fuyin Kan, her brother had seen the danger even\nfaster than she had—but diplomacy was not in his nature.\n“Kaul-jen,” General Ronu began, “what would change\nyour—”\n“You don’t need a surge of graduates from the martial\nschools,” Hilo said to him. “The foreigners have less jade and\nthinner-blooded recruits, but they manage to cook scraps into a\nmeal. Don’t tell me you can’t use all the money and jade\nyou’ve been given to do more with what you already have.”\nNo one, not even Ayt Mada, could speak with Hilo’s tone\nof commanding finality. General Ronu fell as stiffly silent as a\njunior Finger who’d been put in his place by a senior Fist.\n“This has certainly been a robust discussion,” said\nChairman Canto Pan, bravely springing to his feet to defuse\nthe tension and head off any further rejoinders. “One that I\nthink should continue at the next quarterly meeting, after\nwe’ve all had some time to examine the alternatives and\nconsider how best to support General Ronu’s priorities, which\nwe all agree are worthy despite disagreements over how to\nachieve them.” No one objected as Canto thanked Ronu and\nbrought the meeting to a close.

She could hear Koben\nYiro’s deep voice chatting amicably with the Mountain clan’s\ntributary allies as she got up and hurried out of the room.\nCatching up to Hilo alone in hallway, she grabbed his elbow,\nforcing him to stop and face her. “I told you not to refuse\noutright,” she hissed. “You did so without giving us the time to\ncome up with a counterproposal. The Mountain is going to\nspin this against us badly. They’ll make sure we get killed in\nthe press.”\nHilo’s face twisted into a glare. “I’d rather be killed by the\npress than actually killed when all of Ayt’s schemes finally\npay off.” He glanced at the people coming out into the hallway\nbehind them and leaned close to snarl a whisper near her ear.\n“You want to do this now, in front of our enemies? I’m\nfighting every fire they set, Shae, and you’re fighting me. The\nPillar’s word is final—but you’re not good at remembering\nthat, are you?” Hilo pulled out of her grasp and headed for the\nstairwell, avoiding the possibility of elevator lobby\nconversation with anyone else. Shae’s shoulders knotted with\nfrustration as she once again watched him go.\n“Kaul-jen,” said a voice behind her. Shae turned to see a\ntall Green Bone with wire-rimmed glasses, whom she\nrecognized as the Weather Man of the Six Hands Unity clan.\nHe’d been sitting two seats to the left of Ayt Mada in the\nmeeting.\nShae took a covert calming breath to smooth the agitation\nout of her jade aura as she nodded toward the man politely,\nsearching her memory for his name. He pushed the down\nbutton for the elevator. “That was an unusually lively KJA\nmeeting, wasn’t it? Very different from the usual budget\ndiscussions,” he said conversationally. “The country may be\ncaught between two tigers, as General Ronu put it, but the\nMountain and No Peak are the two tigers of Kekon. Whenever\nyou roar, we smaller creatures run back and forth, trying to\ndecide who’s less likely to eat us.”\nThe elevator arrived and the doors opened. The Weather\nMan of Six Hands Unity motioned considerately for Shae to\nenter first. She eyed him warily as she did so. She Perceived\nno hostile intent and had no reason to consider the man a\npersonal enemy, but he was, after all, an ally of the Mountain.\nThe man entered after her and immediately hit the button\nto close the doors before anyone else exiting the KJA meeting\ncould get onto the same elevator. Shae tensed. Alone in the\nclose quarters of the elevator, her sense of Perception flared.\nThe man’s pulse had gone up. He was nervous, but it didn’t\nshow on his face as he stood beside her and calmly pressed the\nbutton for the ground floor.\n“Where’s your Pillar?” Shae asked. “Aren’t you leaving\ntogether?”\n“He’ll be along shortly, after he’s done with his\nconversations,” said the Green Bone. “We’re returning to\nLukang tomorrow morning.” Six Hands Unity was based in"

        "text": "together?”\n“He’ll be along shortly, after he’s done with his\nconversations,” said the Green Bone. “We’re returning to\nLukang tomorrow morning.” Six Hands Unity was based in\nthe second-largest city in Kekon, on the island’s southern\ncoast. A single drop of sweat made its way down the side of\nthe man’s forehead. “Have you been to Lukang before, Kaul-\njen?”\n“Yes, though not recently,” Shae said.\n“I think you’d be impressed by how it’s grown. You should\ncome visit, when you have the time.” The man extracted a\nbusiness card from his breast pocket and handed it to her. On\none side of the white card was the man’s name, Tyne Retubin,\nand his contact information. The other side bore the stamped\nred insignia of his clan, a mark that carried the authority of his\nPillar.\n“The Six Hands Unity clan would be honored to host you,”\nTyne said. “You can call me directly, as one Weather Man to\nanother.”\nThe elevator came to a stop. The doors opened and Tyne\nwalked out without another glance or word. Shae hung back,\nso they would not be seen together. She understood that Tyne\nRetu had accomplished a dangerous task given to him by his\nPillar.\nShae slipped the business card into her pocket, fingering\nthe edge of it as if testing the sharpness of a blade. She kept\nher hand on it as she walked the five blocks to Ship Street with\nher mind racing. The rectangle of stiff paper might be another\ntrap by the Mountain. Or it might be a reversal of fortune, an\nanswer from the gods that could solve No Peak’s most\npressing problems and vault it ahead of its enemies. Six Hands\nUnity, the largest tributary clan of the Mountain, was\ninterested in changing allegiance.\n_______\nWoon’s going-away celebration was a casual affair held after\nwork that evening in a private room at the Drunk Duck hoji\nbar. Many of the clan’s Luckbringers came by to enjoy the\nfood and drink and wish Woon well, but they didn’t linger for\nlong. Woon Papidonwa was respected in the office, but he\ndidn’t have many close personal friends on Ship Street. There\nwas a price to be paid for being the Weather Man’s deputy, a\nman answering daily to a younger woman, even if she was a\nKaul.\nAfterward, Woon said, “It was a nice party, Shae-jen.\nThank you.” He hesitated, then confessed, “I would drive you\nhome as usual, but I’ve had a few drinks. I should wait\nawhile.”\n“I’ll drive,” Shae said. “You can clear your head in the\ncar.” Woon handed over his keys and Shae drove to the Kaul\nestate in his car. Splatters of intermittent rain turned into the\nseason’s first heavy downpour by the time they arrived. Shae\nwaved to the guards as she drove through the gate and past the\nmain house, parking Woon’s car at the front of the Weather\nMan’s residence. Woon got out with an umbrella and walked\nShae to the door with it held over both their heads. She let\nthem into the house and took off her coat while Woon shook\nout the umbrella."

Woon accepted the cup she\npoured for him. “I’ll probably drive here after work next week\nwithout thinking,” he said. “And I’ll jerk awake at night in a\npanic that I forgot to remind you of something in your\nschedule.”\n“Don’t do that,” Shae laughed. Turning serious, “I’m glad\nyou’re moving on to a new challenge and will hopefully have\nmore time to spend with Kiya.”\nWoon nodded and drank the tea. He hadn’t said any more\nabout his wife’s miscarriage, or whether they were still trying\nfor children. “How did things go this morning?”\nAfter Shae told him what had happened, he leapt to his feet\nand paced around her living room. “Turning Six Hands Unity\nwould be a huge coup,” Woon said. “Their tribute payments\nalone would be a significant financial boost, not to mention the\nmanpower we would gain in Lukang. That city is growing fast,\nand taking control of it would be a far bigger win than the\nMountain turning Fuyin Kan or any number of our Lantern\nMen.” Woon’s brow creased, the dimple appearing on the right\nside of his forehead as his mind chewed through the same\ncalculations Shae had made earlier in the day. “Could it be a\nsetup? A way to lure us into disclosing information or letting\ndown our guard in some other way?”\nShae said, “I’ve been wondering the same thing.” Tyne had\nseemed sincere, though. He wouldn’t have been so tense in the\nelevator if his clan’s fate was not truly at stake.\nWoon reversed the direction of his pacing. “We have to\npursue this carefully and step by step to be sure it’s genuine\nbefore we meet with their leaders or make any commitment.\nAnd of course, we’ll have to keep it entirely secret. I’ll start\ngathering all the information we have about Six Hands Unity,\nand making discreet calls to our own people in Lukang to learn\nmore.”\nShae nodded and began to agree out loud, then caught\nherself. “No,” she said. When Woon stopped and turned\ntoward her in bewilderment, she reminded him, “That’s not\nyour job anymore. You have other responsibilities now.” She\nsmiled, trying to soften her answer. “You’ll have plenty of\nother things to deal with on behalf of the clan as soon as you\nstart in your new position on Firstday. Leave this work to\nLuto.”\nWoon would be the clan’s Sealgiver, a newly created role\nthey’d decided was overdue and would free some of Shae’s\nschedule from endless meetings. As No Peak’s spokesperson\nand dedicated political liaison, he would be the primary point\nof contact with the Royal Council, foreign government\nrepresentatives, tributary minor clans, and the press.

It was a\ngood job for Woon, who could be counted on to convey\nmessages precisely, to understand and hew to the clan’s\npriorities, to speak carefully to outsiders and never too much.\nHer chief of staff had seemed pleased and grateful with the\nnew assignment, but now he protested, almost angrily, “This is\ntoo big and important to leave to Luto.”\n“You helped to hire him, Papi-jen,” Shae reminded him.\n“You said he was exceptionally clever and organized and you\nwere confident I’d work well with him.”\n“Yes, but—” Woon struggled for a moment. “He’s brand\nnew to the job. I’ve been training him as much as I can, but\nit’ll still take time for him to learn how to be your Shadow.\nTurning a tributary clan is risky and difficult—we can’t afford\nany mistakes. At least let me stay involved and oversee Luto’s\nwork.”\nShae laughed weakly. “Don’t you remember why you\nasked to leave in the first place? You’re supposed to be\nworking less from now on, not more.” She hadn’t been able to\nforget what Hilo had said to her in the car that morning. I don’t\nknow why he tortures himself working for you. Woon was\ninsisting on remaining her aide in some capacity because he\nbelieved she needed him—which she did. “All right,” she\nrelented, “but have Luto do as much of the work as possible,\nand don’t let it take time away from your real job.”\nWoon nodded in relief and sat down beside her on the sofa.\n“No matter what my official title is, my real job is always\nhelping you in whatever way I can, Shae-jen.”\nThe walls of Shae’s throat felt as if they were thickening.\nShe moved closer to her friend and put her arms around him in\nan embrace. “You’ve already done enough,” she said, resting\nher chin on his shoulder. “I’ve relied on you constantly for six\nyears and given you so little in return. When we take our oaths\nas Green Bones, we say we’re ready to die for the clan. But\nliving for the clan, every day, the way you have, Papi-jen—I\nthink that’s even more of a sacrifice.”\nA pulse of emotion shivered through Woon’s jade aura. He\nleaned into her and rested his hand on her arm where it lay\nagainst his chest. “I’m afraid that you think I’m leaving my\npost because I’m tired or unhappy being your Shadow. Or that\nI …” He hesitated. “Or that I expected something more from\nyou. That’s not true.”\nPressure was building inside Shae’s rib cage. She hated\nthat Hilo was right about her not being able to say the things\nthat needed to be said—but she had a chance to change that\nnow, before it was too late. “I could never blame you for\nwanting your own life back when I’m the one who took\nadvantage of you,” she confessed, glad he couldn’t see her\nface, but knowing he could Perceive the thudding of her heart.\n“After Lan was killed, I exploited your grief to pull you into\nworking for me when we both knew you could’ve been\nWeather Man yourself if only things had been different.

I\ncouldn’t have survived on Ship Street without you, but I’m\nsorry for what I did. And I’m sorry it took me so long to say\nso.”\nHer former aide was silent for so long that Shae began to\nfear she’d made an awful mistake by bringing up Lan’s death.\nIt was a sorrow they had in common, but that they held\nindividually. She let her arms fall away from him, but Woon\nturned toward her and wrapped his large hands around hers,\nholding on to them so tightly that she could feel the throb of\nhis pulse in his palms.\n“I could never have been the Weather Man you are, Shae-\njen,” he said roughly, his face lowered. “I wasn’t the Pillarman\nthat Lan-jen needed. I did everything that he asked and kept\nhis secrets without question. That was a mistake. I should’ve\nspoken up, I should’ve confronted him, I should’ve gone to\nHilo-jen. But I didn’t. I was happy to be promoted, and even\nthough I knew Lan was injured and taking shine, I left him\nalone when he most needed me.”\nWoon raised his eyes. His normally steady gaze seemed as\nfragile as paper. “I deserved to die for that failure. I promised\nmyself I would do everything for Lan’s sister that I failed to do\nfor him—I would support her in any way she required, but I\nwould also challenge her, and I would never fail to say things\nthat needed to be said, so she would be the Weather Man I\ncouldn’t be.”\nWoon lifted a hand to brush away the tear that had begun\nto make its way down the side of Shae’s nose. “It wasn’t long\nbefore being your Shadow wasn’t a duty, but what I selfishly\nwanted to do. It hasn’t ever been easy, and there were times I\nwas afraid I’d fail you—but if I had to do it all over again, I\nwouldn’t hesitate. The clan is my blood, but for me, the\nWeather Man is its master.”\nShae could not find any words in reply. The rain had\nstopped and the sky outside was clear. Woon let go of her\nhands and turned aside to hide the embarrassment in his face.\n“I should go,” he said, beginning to stand.\nShae grabbed his wrist and was on her feet before he could\nfully rise. “Don’t.”\nA ripple of mutual intent surged through both of their jade\nauras like a static charge. “Shae …” Woon began, his voice\nstrange. Then the space between them vanished. Woon’s\nmouth was pressed over hers, or her mouth was on his—she\nhad no idea who’d moved first. All she knew was that a flimsy\nwall they’d been holding up from opposite sides had collapsed\nbetween them. She was on her toes, arms wrapped around his\nneck. Woon’s hands were buried in her hair, cupping the back\nof her head as their lips and tongues sought each other with a\ntrembling, desperate abandon that lit every square inch of\nShae’s body.\nShe sank straight into desire like a stone into the center of"

It had been a long time since she’d been with\nanyone, nearly four years, and that relationship had ended in\nunspeakable tragedy. Yet kissing Woon now, there was no\ntentativeness, no self-conscious surrender or shock of\nstrangeness, only solid familiarity and a tumbling release as\nnatural as gravity. She felt arousal blaze through his aura like\nkerosene going up in flames, blinding her sense of Perception\nwith raging heat.\nWoon made a low, frantic noise. He kissed her harder and\nhis hands pushed under her blouse, seeking the bare skin of\nher stomach and back. Their breaths became ragged. She\ntugged at his belt, unbuckling it and freeing his shirt.\nWith a jerk, Woon caught her hand and held it still, pulling\nhis face back and staring at her with mingled lust and\nbewilderment, his chest rising and falling as he fought for\ncontrol. His aura churned as she stared at him wide-eyed like a\nbird caught mid-flight.\n“Why?” he managed to say. “Why now?” Shae couldn’t\ntell if it was a question he expected her to answer. Woon\nturned his face away and shook his head as if he’d taken a\nblow to the skull and was trying to clear spots from his vision.\n“Gods, why, after all this time?”\nShae wanted to seize him, to kiss him again, to drag him\nback into heedless passion, but he was backing away, fastening\nhis belt and tucking in his shirt, unable to meet her eyes. She\nwas stunned by how wounded she felt. “You were my chief of\nstaff,” she said. “We had a professional relationship. And …”\nShe thought back on Maro with a queasy stab of remorse.\n“And we were with other people.”\n“Are,” Woon corrected her. “Are with other people. I’m\nmarried.” He pressed the heel of his hand to his brow, rubbing\nout the dimple. Shae had seen him do the same thing when\nthey were sitting in her office, discussing some thorny\nbusiness issue, and the familiar gesture was suddenly\ndisconcerting to see, here in her house, with both of their faces\nflushed and clothes askew. She was so accustomed to Woon\nbeing her stolid and unflappable aide that the past few minutes\nseemed as if they couldn’t really have happened. But looking\nat his deep-set eyes and firm mouth, his broad chest and long\narms, she felt an odd wonder that it hadn’t happened earlier.\n“I should go,” he said, this time with conviction.\nNumb fear swirled into a cold ball in the bottom of Shae’s\nstomach. She’d ruined their friendship, lost his respect and\naffection. She was terrible with men, she decided, truly the\nworst.\nWordlessly, she dug through the pocket of her jacket for\nhis car keys and handed them over.

He picked up the umbrella by the door without\nlooking at her. His shoulders were bowed. “Good night, Shae-\njen,” he said, trying and failing to sound normal as he opened\nthe door.\n“Good night. Drive safely.” She tried desperately to think\nof something to say to mend the situation before he was gone,\nbut came up with nothing.\nShe stood by the window and watched the headlights of\nWoon’s car come on. After they receded down the driveway\nand were lost to sight beyond the gates of the family estate,\nShae dragged a blanket over her shoulders and sat in silence,\ndrinking the rest of the tea, now bitterly oversteeped and cold.\nCHAPTER\n7\nA New Friend\nT\nhe Clanless Future Movement met twice a week in the\nLittle Persimmon lounge. A year and a half ago, when Bero\nhad first climbed the narrow staircase to the dim second-floor\nroom, he’d found only three men playing cards. Tonight,\nroughly thirty people were clustered at the bar and around the\nsmall tables, drinking brandy and smoking, passing around\npamphlets printed on thin gray newsprint paper.\nOutside, the ever-present street noise of Janloon rose from\na murmur to a torrent as people got off work and spilled\neagerly into a warm spring evening, but the Little\nPersimmon’s few windows remained purposefully closed. The\nhanging red lamps over the black bar and small dance floor\nshed a hazy and claustrophobic glow over cautious faces. The\ndaring attack on the Double Double casino four months ago\nhad attracted prospective revolutionaries, but it had also made\nit more dangerous to gather. The No Peak clan had not\nmanaged to find the perpetrators, but it had energetically\nshaken down every known criminal outfit in its territories and\nspread the word that it would reward anyone who led them to\nthe culprits. The offer was great enough that Bero was tempted\nto turn in Guriho, Otonyo, and Tadino himself, but they would\nlikely rat him out in return before they were killed.\nBero made his way to the cushioned red benches along the\nwall and sat down between Tadino and a young woman\nwearing a pink scarf. He placed the backpack he carried on the\nground between his feet, careful not to let its contents clang\nagainst the floor. Tadino nudged him with a bony elbow and\nwhispered, “You brought the stuff? We’re gonna go out after\nthis and fuck some shit up, right?”\nGuriho and Otonyo weren’t planning any new dramatic\nactions. They said everyone should lie low for a while and\nfocus on growing the CFM’s numbers. But Bero and Tadino\nstill went out occasionally with spray paint and crowbars and\ndid what they could to damage clan businesses, always\nmoving around between neighborhoods and without any\npattern. They were like fish biting a whale, but that was how it\nhad always been for Bero. He was used to being on the"

They were like fish biting a whale, but that was how it\nhad always been for Bero. He was used to being on the\nbottom. Paint could be cleaned off and windows repaired, but\nit still cost the clans every time. More people would see that\nGreen Bones could be defied, even by small fish.\nGuriho stood up at the front of the room with a clipboard\nand began speaking into a microphone. Every time Bero saw\nthe man, he thought of a goat in a sweater. The mixed-blood\nOortokon had small eyes and a long, coarse beard. He\nbreathed heavily and paced as he spoke, and he always seemed\nvaguely unkempt. But he was an energetic speaker. “Jade is\nsaid to be a gift from Heaven, but it’s a curse from hell and its\ndemons. All over the world, people use it for evil. Here in\nKekon, everyone lives under the tyranny of the Green Bones.\nIn Shotar, barukan gang members wear jade while committing\nextortion, murder, and rape. The Espenian military’s jade-\nwearing soldiers turned Oortoko into a war-torn wasteland.”\nGuriho shouted, “And who controls jade? Who sits at the top\nof this pyramid of violence and corruption? The Green Bone\nclans of Kekon.”\nThe crowd muttered its angry agreement and people\nstomped the floor in applause. The woman next to Bero was\nsitting forward at the edge of the bench, listening intently. She\nwas pretty. Very pretty. Too young and pretty for a crowd like\nthis. She had short, sexy hair and milky skin and slightly\nparted full lips.\n“Hey, what’s your name?” Bero asked her.\nShe turned to him, her eyebrows rising with suspicion and\ncuriosity. It was a reaction Bero was accustomed to receiving\nfrom women, on account of his youth and his crooked face,\nwhich made him ugly but also suggested there was something\ninteresting about him, that he might’ve been deformed in a\nduel or battle.\nThe girl with the scarf hesitated. “Ema,” she said.\nBero would like to believe she was flirting with him by\ngiving him a diminutive personal name and not her family\nname, but he knew it was only because no one at these\nmeetings wanted to identify themselves. The crowd was an\nunlikely assortment of people from disreputable backgrounds\nand those with radical agendas—“new green” who wore jade\nillegally, ex-barukan, shine addicts, students, and political\nextremists such as militant Abukei rights activists, anti-dueling\nproponents, and anarchists. There was even, Bero noticed with\nsurprise, a foreigner sitting near the back of the room. Many of\nthese people would hate each other if they didn’t hate the clans\nmore.\n“I’m Bero,” Bero said to the woman, even though she\nhadn’t asked for his name in return. She’d gone back to\nlistening to Guriho, so he nudged her and added, “I used to\nhave jade myself, you know. A lot of it. I always had to be on\nthe run from Green Bones. The bastards nearly killed me,"

I’m\nlucky to be alive.” He could tell from her brief, irritated glance\nthat she didn’t believe him. “It’s true. Let’s go for a drink later\nand I’ll tell you.”\nGuriho glared in the direction of the whispering and Bero\nfell grudgingly silent. Guriho held up one of the pamphlets\nthat were being passed around. “The Manifesto of the Clanless\nFuture Movement,” he declared, and cleared his throat before\nbeginning to read in a solemn and self-important timbre. “In\nthe eternal fight for a more just and equal society free from the\npredations of the powerful against the weak, the goal of our\nnoble struggle is the liberation of the world from the\ndestructive influence of jade and the end of clannism.”\n“That sounds very good, philosophically,” interrupted a\ngruff, accented voice, speaking above the rest, “but what can\nyou actually do against the clans?” Everyone turned. It was the\nforeigner in the room who’d asked the question. He was a\nshort, muscular man, with a large nose, hooded eyes beneath a\nheavy brow, and curly hair the color of rust. Despite being out\nof place in the gathering, he emanated a certain physicality and\nintensity of gaze that Kekonese people who are accustomed to\nGreen Bones recognize as the sign of a formidable man, a man\nwho can fight. The way he addressed Guriho was not\naggressive, but there was challenge in his tone.\n“If you listened before asking questions, you’d find out,\ney?” Guriho said with a frown. “The clans might be powerful,\nbut they can’t exist without the support of the people. The\npoliticians, the Lantern Men, every person who pauses to\nsalute a Green Bone on the street—they all feed the system.\nWe must disrupt the system! We’ll start by creating a\ngroundswell of support by opening people’s eyes—”\n“Yes, yes, you have a nice logo, newsletters, and\nmeetings.” The foreigner spoke Kekonese clearly enough, but\nthe words were clipped both by his accent and his impatience.\n“But the Green Bone clans have jade, money, weapons, and\npeople. It seems you don’t have much of any of those things.”\nTadino got to his feet. He worked at the Little Persimmon\nas a bar runner, and it was on account of his stepfather being\nfriends with Guriho that the lounge was a safe place to hold\nthese meetings. “I don’t know how things work where you’re\nfrom,” he exclaimed heatedly, “but here we don’t rudely\ninterrupt people, especially if we’re strangers who haven’t\nintroduced ourselves.”\nThe foreigner stood as well, causing those around him to\nlean away warily. Tadino tensed, but after a thoughtful\nmoment, the curlyhaired man merely spread his hands. “You\nare right,” he admitted, more humbly. “I apologize if I offend\nanyone with my blunt questions. You can see I’m not from\nhere. My name is Molovni and I came to Janloon because I"

My name is Molovni and I came to Janloon because I\nheard about your worthy cause.”\nA murmur of suspicion and astonishment went through the\nLittle Persimmon. Even Guriho blinked his small eyes and\nseemed unsure of what to say.\n“He’s Ygutanian,” Ema whispered with excitement.\n“You may not know this, but there are many outside your\ncountry who are sympathetic to the plight of the Kekonese\npeople living under the boot of the clans. I came here to learn\nmore about your struggle.” Molovni sat back down, nodding to\nGuriho. “I spoke out of turn, but please, continue your speech.\nIt is ambitious, no doubt, but even goals that seem out of reach\ncan be accomplished with the help of the right friends.”\nCHAPTER\n8\nSpeaking for the Family\nE\nmery Anden tried not to be made nervous by the half dozen\nforeign doctors watching his midterm exam. Pretend they’re\nnot here, he told himself firmly, turning away as he rolled up\nhis sleeves and fastened the physician’s training band around\nhis left wrist. It was a snugfitting piece of leather, similar to\nthe one he’d worn as a teenager at Kaul Dushuron Academy,\nbut dyed bright yellow to indicate he was a student in the\nmedical profession. There were five pieces of jade on Anden’s\nband, far less than he’d handled in the past, but sufficient for\nwhat was required today.\nAnden closed his eyes and took five long, even breaths,\npacing himself through the familiar adjustment, then walked\nover to the sink to wash his hands. His body hummed with\njade energy and nerves. Six years ago—a lifetime, it seemed—\nhe’d sworn he would never wear green again. Now he was\nputting it on and taking it off so frequently it had become\nroutine and indistinguishable from the other drudgeries and\nstresses of medical school. In his second year at the College of\nBioenergetic Medicine, he was required to gain a certain\nnumber of hours of clinical experience, but when he’d walked\ninto Janloon General Hospital for the first time to begin\ntraining, he’d briefly considered turning around and quitting\nhis studies. He had bad memories of this place. Sitting in the\ncorridor as a child listening to his mother’s screams. Waking\nup feverish and jade parched after killing Gont Asch. It had\ntaken weeks for his stomach to stop clenching when he walked\nthrough the hospital doors. Being put on the spot in front of\nwatching strangers in an operating room caused the buried\ndiscomfort to sit up again.\nSix Espenian doctors stood against the wall in loaned\nscrubs, holding clipboards and pens. One of them had a 35 mm\ncamera in hand. They were visitors from the Demphey\nMedical Research Center at Watersguard University in\nAdamont Capita, here to study the use of jade in the healthcare\nfield. The Espenians had decades ago seen the military\nusefulness of jade, but only recently had some of them become\ninterested in how the Kekonese employed jade abilities in\nother areas.

They watched Anden with such intensely\nexpectant scrutiny that he was reminded of being under the\nglare of Kaul Du Academy masters during final Trials.\nThe patient—a fifty-seven-year-old man with a vascular\ntumor of the liver—had already been anesthetized and prepped\nfor surgery. Anden’s job was purely preoperative; the surgeon\nhad not yet come into the room. Dr. Timo, Anden’s\nsupervising Green Bone physician, checked the man’s vital\nsigns, then nodded for Anden to proceed. “Take your time,” he\nencouraged.\nAnden studied the X-ray images once more, to remind\nhimself of the shape and size of the tumor to be removed, then\nhe stretched out his Perception and burrowed his awareness\ninto the unconscious man’s energy. The steady throb of the\npatient’s blood and organs resolved into a map in Anden’s\nmind. After a broad glance around the landscape of the body,\nhe brought the focus of his Perception into the network of\nblood flow within the man’s torso, navigating his way through\nwhat felt like layers of connected piping, of varying lengths\nand widths, all of them humming with the life they carried.\nAnden’s eyes went unfocused, sliding halfway shut in\nconcentration.\nBeing a Green Bone doctor required as much finesse in\nPerception as it did in Channeling. Anden had always been\nnaturally talented at the latter, but honing the former required\ncountless hours of study and practice. As a student at the\nAcademy, being trained for a future as a Fist of the No Peak\nclan, he’d learned to think of Perception and Channeling as\nshield and spear, to be deployed with fast, deadly, and unsubtle\nforce. Perceiving the murderous intent of an assassin and\nChanneling to stop a heart were entirely different from the\ndelicate work he had to bend his jade abilities toward now.\nStanding next to the operating table, Anden brought a hand to\nhover over the upper right portion of the man’s abdomen. He\nisolated the hepatic artery and Channeled into it with a light,\nsteady touch, feeding in enough energy to form a clot cutting\noff blood flow to the malignant tumor. It took only a few\nminutes. Dr. Timo stood nearby, following the procedure with\nhis own Perception and ready to take over if need be. When\nAnden stepped back and dropped his hand, the doctor nodded\nin approval, then quickly and expertly closed off a few of the\nsmaller veins, completing the job and ensuring the entire\ntumor could now be surgically removed with minimal blood\nloss.\nOrdinarily, the surgeon would now step in to perform the\nresection, but because of the observing foreign visitors, Anden\nstood around and waited for fifteen minutes while more X-rays\nwere taken and developed, verifying with contrast dye that\nblood flow to the cancerous growth had been shut down. The\nEspenians gathered around the X-ray films, making notes on\ntheir clipboards and talking to each other. Anden was free to\ngo.

He took off the\ntraining band and leaned his head back against the wall,\nclosing his eyes and riding through the momentary\ndisorienting nausea.\nMost Green Bone medical professionals did not take off\ntheir green, but Anden was strict about only wearing jade\nwhen he was on the job, so to speak. Like penitents and\nteachers, doctors were technically beholden to no clan and it\nwas considered a breach of aisho to harm them, but Anden’s\nsituation was unique. He was a member of the Kaul family,\nwell known to be the man who’d killed Gont Asch, the former\nHorn of the Mountain clan. He’d also done work for his\ncousins in Espenia, participating in the assassination of the\nsmuggler Zapunyo. Doctor or not, he was a Green Bone of No\nPeak, and he was not willing to take any chances, either with\nthe possibility that he would be considered one of the clan’s\nwarriors or that he would become one, reacting with jade\nabilities in a lethal way. It would not take much for him to be\npulled back onto the path he’d so adamantly rejected.\nAnden opened his eyes to see a couple of the Espenian\ndoctors standing in front of him with expressions of great\ninterest. The taller of them, a man with a trim beard and a\nbroad smile, said, “That was an impressive demonstration you\ngave us back there. Might I ask, where are you from? Are you\n… What are …” He gestured with open hands, obviously\nasking Anden about his ambiguous ethnicity.\nThe translator standing beside the doctors began to repeat\nthe question in Kekonese, but Anden stopped him and replied\nin Espenian, stifling the urge to grimace at the foreigner’s\nawkward inquiry. “My father was Espenian,” he explained.\n“But I never knew him. I was born in Janloon.”\n“You speak Espenian quite well, though,” said the doctor.\n“I lived in Port Massy for nearly four years,” Anden\nexplained. “I earned a college degree and worked there before\ncoming back to Janloon.”\n“Is that so?” The foreign doctor’s smile grew. “Do you\never go back to visit Port Massy? Would you consider coming\nto Adamont Capita?” He fished a business card from his wallet\nand handed it to Anden. “My name’s Dr. Elan Martgen. I’m\none of the principal investigative team leaders at the Demphey\nMedical Research Center. After what I’ve seen during this trip,\nI’d like to invite some of the practitioners from Kekon to visit\nus and put on demonstrations of bioenergetic healing\ntechniques to a larger audience of healthcare professionals at\nour annual medical conference this summer. Of course, we\nwould pay for your travel and accommodations.”\nAnden stood up and accepted the card, although he was\nconfused by the invitation. “I’m glad your trip has been useful,\nbut you should invite someone else to your conference.

They don’t consider it as valid\nas the physical sciences and believe there’s little reason to\nstudy practices that have up until now been confined to a\nsmall, faraway island.”\n“You could help us change their minds,” said Dr. Martgen.\nAnden looked between the two men and understood now\nthat he’d been approached because of his appearance and his\npart-Espenian ancestry. If the people at Demphey could see\nsomeone who looked Espenian and who spoke Espenian\npracticing what was viewed as an obscure and mysterious\nforeign healing art, it would go a long way toward advancing\nDr. Martgen’s cause with whatever peers, superiors, or\nstakeholders he needed to impress.\n“I’m happy to stay in contact,” Anden said in a\nnoncommittal way.\n“Please do think about it,” said Dr. Martgen, shaking\nAnden’s hand before rejoining the rest of his group as they\nwere led away to whatever was next on their schedule. When\nthey were gone, Anden studied the card for a moment before\nstowing it in his pocket.\nUntil now, he had not thought seriously about returning to\nvisit Espenia and found the idea both unexpectedly appealing\nand vaguely uncomfortable. Upon returning to Janloon, Anden\nhad come to the strange and sobering realization that he’d\nnever lived in the city of his birth as an adult. In many ways,\nhe’d spent the last year and a half reinventing himself. He was\na medical student now, he had his own apartment in Old Town\nnear the hospital, he was an uncle to three small children. Port\nMassy seemed far away, his years there almost like a dream,\nparts of it happy, others bittersweet, a few truly nightmarish.\nSometimes he thought about the people he’d become close to\nthere: his host family, Mr. and Mrs. Hian; Dauk Losun and his\nwife, Sana; his friends from relayball and the grudge hall. And\nCory. He still thought about Cory, occasionally with active\nlonging but more often with wistful curiosity, wondering what\nhe was doing.\nThe Espenian doctors had extended an invitation to Anden\nnot because of his nascent medical skills, but because of what\nhe represented. It was the first time in his life that he could\nrecall strangers viewing his mixed blood as an advantage,\nsomething desirable instead of unfortunate.

At the clan party,\nWen had told Anden his worth lay not in jade ability, but who\nhe was as a person. He had not quite been able to internalize\nhis sister-in-law’s encouragement, but he had not forgotten it\neither.\n_______\nAnden went to the Kaul house on Sixthday to speak to his\ncousins. The Pillar, the Weather Man, and the Horn were in a\nmeeting behind closed doors, so Anden sat with his nephews\non the living room sofa, reading picture books to them while\nhe waited. Niko listened quietly, but Ru asked so many\nquestions on every page that they barely got through a single\nstory before Jaya woke from her nap in the other room, crying\nand grumpy. Anden loved the children, especially Niko, but\ncouldn’t help but feel grateful that he would never have to be a\nparent himself.\nWhen the door to the study opened and Juen Nu came out,\nAnden knocked and went in. Hilo was at his desk with his\nhead propped heavily on one hand. The papers spread in front\nof him contained charts and numbers with highlighted notes in\nShae’s handwriting. Anden couldn’t tell if the Pillar’s\ndecidedly sullen expression was on account of being forced to\nstudy the dense information, or in response to the messages\nthey conveyed. He glanced up. “What is it, Andy?”\nAnden knew from tense dinner table conversation that the\nMountain was throwing around its weight and spending\nheavily to squeeze No Peak from every direction. When Lan\nhad been Pillar, Ayt Mada had waged a campaign to weaken\nNo Peak by encroaching on its territories. Now their enemies\nwere relying on money and the press instead of spies and street\ncriminals. This time, however, Anden wasn’t a teenager\nwaiting helplessly to join the war. He was an adult who’d been\nin the war already and had his own networks and influence.\n“I want to take a trip back to Espenia,” he told his cousins.\nAfter he explained his request, Hilo lit a cigarette and\nrubbed his eyebrow with his thumb. “Some people in the clan\nwant us to pull out of that country altogether, not get even\nmore tangled up over there.” Espenia was in the news all the\ntime these days. The ROE was planning to expand its naval\nbase on Euman Island to bolster its strength in the region\nagainst Ygutan. The decision had drawn considerable public\nopposition in Kekon.\n“It’s worth a try, Hilo-jen,” Anden said.\nShae was sitting in one of the armchairs with her arms\ncrossed, some distance from Hilo. The Pillar and the Weather\nMan were still on poor terms. She gave Anden a wry smile.\n“Do you remember how upset you were when we first sent\nyou there? And now you’re asking to return.” She said to Hilo,\n“Anden should go. Revenue from our Espenian businesses is\nsaving us right now, but it’s an ongoing problem that the two\ncountries don’t trust or understand each other. If there’s\nanything we can do to change that, even in a single field like\nhealthcare, it may help us.”\nHilo didn’t look entirely convinced, but he said, “All right,"

        "text": "anything we can do to change that, even in a single field like\nhealthcare, it may help us.”\nHilo didn’t look entirely convinced, but he said, “All right,\ncousin. You can go and speak for the family.”\nAt that moment, Niko shouted, “No!” The boy was\nstanding in the partly open doorway to the study, his small\nfists clenched by his side. “Espenia is the place where Ma got\nhurt. Uncle Anden shouldn’t go there. You can’t make him!”\nThe adults stared at Niko in astonishment.\nAnden went to the six-year-old and crouched down in front\nof him, placing his hands on his nephew’s trembling shoulders.\n“Niko-se, I asked to go,” he reassured him. “It’ll be a short\ntrip, and not for anything dangerous. Of course, there’s always\nsome risk, but families like ours can’t afford to not take risks.”\n_______\nThe Weather Man made phone calls to the dean of the College\nof Bioenergetic Medicine, impressing upon him the No Peak\nclan’s interest in the matter, so the trip was arranged with\nimpressive alacrity. Two months later, Anden and three of the\nbest physicians on the college’s faculty, including Dr. Timo,\narrived in Adamont Capita. AC was an old city, with narrow\ncobblestone streets and historic brick buildings. White marble\nmonuments were tucked around every corner behind glass\noffice towers, imposing government institutions, and foreign\nembassies. Anden had never been to the capital of the\nRepublic of Espenia before, even though it was only three\nhours away by bus from Port Massy, where he had lived and\nworked for nearly four years. It hadn’t occurred to Anden to\nexplore other cities, not when Port Massy had already seemed\nhuge and strange and overwhelming to him as a nineteen-year-\nold.\nNow, however, he appreciated the opportunity to act like a\ntourist. Dr. Martgen and the staff at the Demphey Medical\nResearch Center were welcoming hosts, housing Anden and\nthe three visiting Green Bone doctors in a well-appointed hotel\nand touring them around the Watersguard University campus\nand the major city sights when they weren’t busy meeting\npeople and doing demonstrations for intrigued researchers. As\na mere student, Anden didn’t lead any of the meetings or\npresentations, but he assisted on several occasions and acted as\nthe translator for the entire group. At the end of the five-day\nconference, he felt far wearier from thinking and speaking in\ntwo languages, and navigating the opposing customs of both\nthe visiting and hosting parties, than from any exertion of jade\nabilities.\nDr. Timo and the other doctors flew straight out of\nAdamont Capita back to Janloon the morning afterward.\nAnden stayed. He took a taxi from the hotel to the federal\nIndustry Department, which was housed in a fortress-like\nrectangular building down the block and across the boulevard\nfrom the National Assembly. As he waited on a sofa in the\nelevator lobby, he gazed out at the seat of government—an\nenormous white structure rising in square tiers to an imposing\npyramidal peak, its sides lit with floodlights that changed color\nat night. Its straight lines and perfect planes seemed stark and\nforbidding to Anden, closed and inscrutable."

Its straight lines and perfect planes seemed stark and\nforbidding to Anden, closed and inscrutable.\nA secretary came out to meet him. She apologized for the\nwait and escorted Anden to a corner office on the seventh\nfloor. The nameplate on the door read: KELLY DAUK, DEPUTY\nSECRETARY. Anden went in.\nCory’s eldest sister, Dauk Kelishon, bore resemblance to\nher father and her brother in the shape of her face and mouth,\nwhich was lifted in a polite smile as she stood to shake\nAnden’s hand. She motioned him into a chair across from her\ndesk. “Mr. Emery, I presume?” The deputy secretary was\nperhaps forty years old, dressed in a chalk-gray skirt suit,\nblack blouse, and pearl necklace. An immaculate chinlength\nbob framed her face. In her bright but stiff professional\nmanner, she was wholly unlike her gregarious younger brother.\nAnden said, in Kekonese, “Ms. Dauk, thank you for\nagreeing to see me.”\nThe woman swiveled her chair sideways, leaning one arm\non the desk and crossing her legs as she studied Anden, her\npolite smile unchanged. “I agreed to this meeting as a favor to\nmy parents. My mother can be extremely insistent,” she said,\nreplying to him in Espenian. “According to them, you’re a\nrepresentative of one of the Kekonese clans. I’m afraid I’m\nunclear as to what that has to do with me and the Industry\nDepartment.”\nShe was not being rude exactly, but Anden was a little\nsurprised by the aloof tone and the switch back into Espenian.\nHe reluctantly followed her into his second language, speaking\nmore deliberately out of necessity. “I’m visiting Adamont\nCapita for other reasons, and while I’m here, I’m hoping to\nmake some friendly connections in the Industry Department,\non behalf of the Kaul family of No Peak.”\n“Is that the name of the clan you work for?”\nAnden hesitated, unsure if she was being serious, or\nfeigning ignorance in order to test him for some reason. “The\nNo Peak clan is one of the two major clans in Kekon,” he said\nslowly. “We control nearly half of the capital city, as well as\njade mining, and businesses in many industries across the\ncountry. Roughly half of the seats in the Kekonese Royal\nCouncil are occupied by legislators who are loyal to us. The\nPillar of No Peak is my cousin. My other cousin runs the\nbusiness side as Weather Man. They’ve asked me to speak for\nthe family.”\nThe deputy secretary replied, “Mr. Emery, my job here in\nthe Industry Department is to work alongside Secretary\nHughart on issues of domestic economic policy. Bioenergetic\njade falls outside of our purview.”\n“I understand,” Anden said, “but jade isn’t the clan’s only\nconcern. We want to do business in Espenia and to build\npartnerships here, but there are barriers to us being able to do\nso. We would like to advocate our position with policymakers\nin the Espenian government. Of course, my family converses\nwith the Espenian ambassador and the International Affairs"

Of course, my family converses\nwith the Espenian ambassador and the International Affairs\nDepartment, as well as the ROE military on Euman Island, but\nwe also need friends here in Adamont Capita who have\ninfluence with the premier and the National Assembly.”\nAnden paused. Perhaps it was Kelly Dauk’s persistently\nneutral expression, or the fact that he did not normally speak\nin Espenian at such length and in such complexity, but Anden\nfelt as if the words were coming slower and with increasing\ndifficulty. He wondered if he was muddling them, not making\nhimself properly understood. “I greatly respect your family,\nand I consider your parents and your brother to be good\npersonal friends.”\nCory’s sister regarded Anden for a long moment. “My\nparents,” she said at last, “are from an older generation of\nKekonese immigrants who still uphold traditional honor\nculture values revering clans and jade. I’m sure that even in\ntheir old age, they’re still bossing around the neighbors in their\nlittle patch of Southtrap. They placed expectations on my\nbrother ever since he was a little boy, to train to wear jade, to\nbe ‘green,’ as they say.” Her polite smile grew but held no\nwarmth. “I can see why they’ve taken such a liking to you, a\nyoung man from the old country.”\nAnden searched for a response, but before he could find\none, Kelly Dauk laced her hands and said, “My parents and\ntheir friends complain endlessly about the government. They\nthink it’s the height of tyranny and racial prejudice that\ncivilian ownership of jade is banned. Your clan associates in\nKekon want to make money selling bioenergetic jade in this\ncountry, and wish to see that prohibition relaxed or overturned\naltogether. Am I understanding things correctly?”\nAnden was taken aback and without thinking, he reverted\nback to speaking in Kekonese. “It’s not about selling jade,” he\nsaid. “Don’t you want to see such an unreasonable law, one\nthat targets and harms Kekonese people, removed? Especially\nwhen you come from a Green Bone family yourself?”\n“I don’t make the laws, Mr. Emery,” Ms. Dauk responded,\nstill speaking in Espenian. “But unlike some people, I do abide\nby them.”\nAnden protested, “My family would never expect or ask\nyou to do anything difficult or inappropriate that might harm\nyour own position. My only hope in coming here today was\nthat you might be willing to speak to my cousins, to introduce\nthem to Secretary Hughart and other top officials in your\ndepartment, and maybe give us some valuable advice on how\nto go about lobbying the right people in government, since you\nhave so much experience with how things work here in\nAdamont Capita. I would ask you for this favor, as a friend of\nyour family, and as one Kekonese to another.”\n“I’m Espenian, Mr. Emery,” said Kelly Dauk. “And an\nofficeholder in the federal government.” She rose from her\ndesk in polite but firm dismissal, and her secretary opened the\ndoor to show Anden out. “If you want to push your clan’s\nagenda, you’ll have to go through other channels.”\n_______"

He stared out the\nwindow at the familiar skyline of the metropolis, nursing a\nsense of profound and uneasy nostalgia as the bus crossed the\nIron Eye Bridge and passed under the shadow of the famous\nMast Building. Mr. Hian met Anden at the bus station in\nQuince and welcomed him as if he were a returning son,\nembracing him and remarking that he was looking healthy.\nThey went straight to the Dauks’ home, where Mrs. Hian\nand Dauk Sana were preparing an enormous welcome dinner\nof broiled pepper fish, braised greens, five mushroom soup,\nand fried short noodles. Dauk Losun sat Anden at the head of\nthe dinner table, and throughout the evening, Anden was plied\nwith food and conversation. Old friends and acquaintances\ncame by: Derek, who now owned and ran an auto repair shop;\nSammy and two other Green Bones named Rick and Kuno;\nTod, now a Navy Angels corporal, home on leave; Tami, who\nwas working in a dental office and doing freelance\nphotography. All of them were friendly but a little reserved,\nspeaking to Anden less casually than they used to when he’d\nlived in the Southtrap neighborhood, as if he’d aged ten years\nduring the past two, and was now older instead of younger\nthan they were. Anden felt conscious that he was being treated\nso well not simply because people remembered him fondly\nfrom when he was a student boarding with the Hians, but\nbecause he was a representative of the No Peak clan, an\nimportant visitor from Janloon sent by the Kaul family.\nPerhaps they’d also come out of curiosity, because they’d\nheard stories: He’d planned the assassination of an\ninternational jade smuggler; he’d nearly been executed by the\nCrews along with Rohn Toro; he was secretly a powerful\nGreen Bone who’d put on jade to bring a woman back to life.\nCory arrived after dinner, claiming that he’d had to work\nlate at the office. As usual, his entrance caused a minor stir of\nfriendly shouting, backslapping, and laughter. He said hello to\nhalf a dozen people and came over to shake Anden’s hand,\nsmiling as if they were old but distant friends. He had a petite\nEspenian woman with him, whom he introduced as “Daria, a\nfriend of mine from law school.” Anden felt his mouth go\nuncomfortably dry. He had a hard time keeping up his end of\nthe conversation when Cory asked him how he was doing,\nhow he liked being back in Janloon, how his studies were\ngoing.\n“I never pegged you as a doctor, Anden, though I’m sure\nyou’ll be toppers at it,” Cory said with a laugh that was only\nslightly forced. “Goes to show what I know, right?” He used\nAnden’s name and did not once call him islander in the\naffectionate, teasing way that he used to.

Anden wondered\npainfully how Cory did it—how was he able to forgive and\nmove on and act so normal?—but then again, his sunny\ndisposition and easygoing nature were things Anden had\nadmired about him and found endearing. Cory didn’t stay at\nthe house long, departing with his friend after less than an\nhour and leaving Anden sad and relieved.\nAt the end of the evening, as Mrs. Hian and Dauk Sana\ncleared dishes and tidied the kitchen, Dauk Losun stretched\nand said to Anden, “I’d like to go for a walk around the block\nto work off some of that meal. Will you join me?”\nIt was a warm summer evening, with enough humidity\nhanging in the air to threaten a thunderstorm later in the night.\nAs Dauk and Anden strolled through Southtrap, people\ntouched their foreheads in greeting, dipping into shallow\nsalutes toward the man they called the Pillar. Anden slowed\nhis stride to match Dauk’s leisurely pace.\n“I’m sorry, Anden, for the way my daughter treated you,”\nDauk said. “In truth, I’m ashamed.”\n“There’s no need to apologize, Dauk-jen,” Anden said.\n“Kelishon is very independent, very driven,” Dauk\nexplained, shaking his head. “She’s always chased\nachievement, and she wants nothing to do with what she sees\nas the old Kekonese ways, her parents’ ways. So she lives by\nthe rules of Espenia. Now that she’s reached a high position in\ngovernment, I hoped she would remember where she came\nfrom and be willing to help her own people, but it seems she’s\neven more rigid and aloof and set on distancing herself from\nus.”\n“Some people turn out differently from the rest of their\nfamily, regardless of blood or upbringing,” Anden pointed out.\n“It’s no one’s fault.” He wasn’t going to embarrass Dauk by\nshowing any of his own disappointment, though he couldn’t\nhelp but wonder how it was that in Espenia someone who was\nfaithless to their family could still rise to such a high position\nin society.\n“Maybe I should’ve tried harder to train my daughters to\nbe Green Bones,” Dauk said with a sigh. “When I was young\nit simply wasn’t done, unless they were lay healers like Sana,\nor maybe penitents. Now you tell me there are women Green\nBones in Kekon, including your own cousin, and even a\nwoman Pillar. The world changes so quickly, and I’m an old\nman.”\n“You’re not old yet, Dauk-jen,” Anden said. Dauk was\nsixty-four and still possessed a hearty appetite and energetic\nlaugh, although in the two years since the death of his good\nfriend Rohn Toro, the Pillar of Southtrap seemed to have\nindeed aged quickly. There were heavy lines around his mouth\nnow, his hairline had receded even farther, and Anden had\nseen him swallow pills with his meal.\n“You know the old saying: ‘Jade warriors are young, and\nthen they are ancient.’ I know which side I’m nearer to,” Dauk"

The Slow War has worsened relations\nwith the ROE and our enemies are using that against us, even\nas they attack us in many other ways. We need our businesses\nhere in Espenia, so my cousins are looking for any leverage to\nimprove our position, even long shots.”\nDauk pursed his lips. “I would also like nothing more than\nto see the ban on jade lifted, but I’m not sure that’s possible.\nThe No Peak clan is powerful, but it can’t change the attitudes\nand laws of an entire country of people who don’t understand\nus.”\nAfter being so rudely rebuffed the previous day, Anden\nwas inclined to agree with Dauk, but he said, “Only five years\nago, we thought there was nothing we could do against the\nCrews except take their abuse, but look at how things have\nchanged. Who’s to say what could happen in the future?”\n“Spoken with the optimism of a young man.” Dauk\nsnorted, but he smiled in the dark.\nAnden asked, “Have you had any more trouble with the\nCrews lately?” Crewboys and Green Bones in Port Massy\nmaintained a violent hatred for each other. The local Crews\nbelieved the Kekonese had deliberately sold them bad jade and\nwere to blame for the ruin of Boss Kromner’s Southside Crew\nand the resulting bloody and sensational Crew wars and police\ncrackdown. The Kekonese would never forgive the brutal\nexecution of Rohn Toro.\nDauk Losun’s expression sobered. “The Crews are\nwounded, but wounded animals are still dangerous. We have\nmore jade and more trained Green Bones than we used to, so\nthe Crews have reason to respect and fear us. We have No\nPeak to thank for that, but it’s possible to go too far, to expose\nourselves to danger by acting too openly and forcefully.”\nThey’d arrived back at the Dauks’ house. Anden could hear\nthe Hians’ and Sana’s voices, but the Pillar didn’t go inside\nyet. He paused on the walkway up to the door and rubbed a\nhand over the back of his neck before turning to face Anden,\nhis brow furrowed as he chose his words.\n“Your cousin, Kaul Hilo, sent his own Pillarman to help us\npunish the Southside Crew. They found and executed the men\nwho murdered my good friend Rohn Toro and who nearly\nkilled you and your sister-in-law.”\nAnden did not reply.

Anden, it was too terrible. Maik went\ntoo far; there was no need for it.”\nOn New Year’s, as the fireworks were going off, Tar had\ndrunkenly thrown an arm over Anden’s shoulders. “I want you\nto know, I sent those spenny bastards to the afterlife screaming\nthe whole way. For you, kid.” He’d clinked Anden’s glass of\nhoji with his own, then wheeled off into the party.\nDauk blew out a troubled breath. “It’s only natural to take\nvengeance for our friends and to punish our enemies, but if\nwe’re connected to horrible crimes, we’ll only be seen as\nkillers, and jade will always be covered in blood. You come\nhere to tell me that No Peak wants to grow its businesses and\nbuild its influence. Acting in ways that make us seem even\nworse than the Crews—that goes against what you’re hoping\nfor.”\nAnden said quietly, “Dauk-jen, you’re right to bring this\nup.”\n“You’ve lived here, Anden; you understand that in\nEspenia, we Green Bones have to tread much more carefully\nthan in Janloon. As the Crews have gotten weaker, the police\nhave turned their attention on us. They look for any excuse to\narrest people in Kekonese neighborhoods and search them for\njade, even if no other crime has been committed.” Dauk\ngrumbled, “It does keep Coru busy—he’s had no shortage of\ndefense counsel work. But it hurts our community. Young\npeople these days, why would they want to train in the jade\ndisciplines if it means facing persecution and living like\noutsiders? They choose instead to abandon their heritage to fit\nin like proper Espenians. Anden, my greatest fear is that in\ntwenty years, there will not be any real Green Bones left in\nthis country.”\nA strong breeze stirred the humid summer night.\nSomewhere in the distance, a siren rose and fell. Tomorrow,\nAnden would be on a plane headed home, with no tangible\nvictories to report to his cousins, nothing that would materially\nhelp No Peak. The foreboding in Dauk’s voice deepened his\nfeelings of futility. He respected Dauk Losun and trusted his\njudgment, though he resented the man as well, for forcing him\nto give up Cory. “Dauk-jen, I hope you’re wrong,” Anden\nsaid.\nDauk reached under the collar of his shirt, closing a hand\naround the circular jade pendant he wore on a silver chain\naround his neck. “I hope so too. I worry about the future, but I\ncan only do what I’ve always done, which is to talk to people\nreasonably, for the good of the community, while I still can.”\nThe Pillar of Southtrap clapped a reassuring hand to Anden’s\nshoulder and led them back into the house to join the others."

Located in the Yoyoyi district, it\nwas a No Peak property, but the owner, a retired clan Fist,\ncharged only a modest additional fee to visiting practitioners,\nincluding Green Bones from tributary and neutral clans,\ntravelers from as far away as Espenia, independent coaches\nwho used the space to work with their clients, and even a few\nbarukan immigrants with no sworn allegiance but who were\ntrusted to behave themselves.\nThe training space was large and well-equipped, reputedly\nsecond only to the Mountain-controlled Factory in Spearpoint.\nA framed motivational quote over the entrance read,\nPerfection of character is the seventh discipline of the jade\nwarrior. When Hilo walked inside the building on a Firstday\nafternoon, there were only a few of the clan’s Fingers on the\nmain training floor, sparring with dulled moon blades and\npracticing Lightness with weight vests. When they noticed the\nPillar’s entrance, they paused and saluted him, calling out,\n“Kauljen!” Hilo waved in acknowledgment but did not stop to\nchat.\nOn the mats at the back of the building, Master Aido was\nworking on talon knife drills with a man whose unusual\nreputation had traveled up the clan’s grapevine all the way to\nthe Pillar. The stranger was shorter than Hilo had expected, fit\nand strongly built, with close-cropped dark hair and a shadow\nof facial stubble. His jade aura hummed with the strain of\nexertion but revealed little else—the psychic equivalent of a\nresting poker face. Hilo could see at once that the man\npossessed the confident physicality of a skilled fighter, but he\nmoved differently from anyone else in the gym. He did not\nemploy the usual techniques or classic combinations. As he\ndefended and countered each of Master Aido’s attacks, he\nseemed to rely surprisingly little on his jade abilities, slipping\nin Strength and Steel and sometimes a short Deflection in a\nfast and stealthy manner, as if trying to hide them behind\nmovements that were simple and obvious. Green Bones often\nawed rivals and onlookers with raw jade ability—powerful\nDeflections, leaps of Lightness—especially in public duels\nwhere the outcome was not intentionally fatal. This man’s\nconstrained actions were entirely efficient and practical. Jade\nwas a slim weapon, a final resort, drawn quickly to neutralize\nthe enemy, but that was all. It was a modern soldier’s approach\nto jade combat. IBJCS—the Integrated Bioenergetic Jade\nCombat System.\n“Master Aido,” Hilo said, stepping onto the mat.\n“Introduce me to this student of yours.”\nThe old trainer seemed surprised to see the Pillar here.

Aido wiped his brow and\nsaid, “Kaul-jen, this is Jim Sunto.” To the other man, “Jim,\nthis is Kaul Hiloshudon, the Pillar of the No Peak clan.”\nSunto looked between Hilo and Master Aido. Hilo’s eyes\nfell upon the man’s jade: two green dog tags worn on a chain\naround his neck. They hung next to a second, shorter chain\nwith a triangular gold pendant: the Truthbearers symbol of\nMount Icana. Sunto appeared to be in his late twenties.\nYounger than Hilo. At thirty-four, it surprised Hilo to find so\nmany people were now younger than him.\nSunto nodded warily but did not salute. “I know who Kaul\nHilo is.”\nHilo said to Master Aido, “I trust I didn’t interrupt your\nsession.”\n“We were just finishing,” said the trainer, taking the hint.\n“Jim, I’ll see you this time next week. Kaul-jen.” He saluted\nthe Pillar and tactfully withdrew, leaving the two men standing\non the mat alone.\nSunto walked to a nearby towel rack. He wiped the sweat\noff his face and slung the towel over the back of his neck. “Is\nthere a problem with me training here?” he asked over his\nshoulder.\nNo Green Bone in Janloon, friend or enemy, would speak\nto the Pillar of the No Peak clan in such a curt and rude way,\nturning his back, not saluting or showing proper respect. “No\nproblem,” Hilo said. “It’s only that I heard there was an\nEspenian Navy Angel living and training here in Janloon, and\nI had to come see for myself.”\n“Ex-Angel,” Sunto corrected. “I left a couple years ago.”\n“Word has gotten out among my Fists that you’re a serious\nsparring partner,” the Pillar said, strolling a partial circle\naround Sunto with his hands in his pockets. “They say you\nbroke Heike’s nose.”\n“An accident he deserved.” Sunto spoke Kekonese fluently\nbut with an obvious Espenian accent. “He got carried away\nthrowing Deflections and didn’t keep his guard up.”\n“You’ve been teaching classes around here.”\n“A few seminars. IBJCS basics, small arms concealment,\nnonlethal submission, that sort of thing. People have asked,\nand it’s extra money for me.” Sunto remained standing in\nplace casually, but the suspicion was naked in his voice, and\nhe kept glancing from side to side, as if expecting to see the\nclan’s Fists closing in from all directions.\nHilo said, “Let’s go somewhere to talk, Lieutenant.”\n“I’d rather talk right here, thanks.”\n“Suit yourself.” Hilo dropped a hand onto the man’s\nshoulder. Sunto reacted at once, twisting away from the hold,\nseizing and locking Hilo’s wrist. Hilo’s other hand was already\nmoving, Channeling into the man’s right lung. The strike was\nfar from the heart and would not do any permanent damage,\nbut it would be terribly painful, collapse Sunto to the ground,"

The strike was\nfar from the heart and would not do any permanent damage,\nbut it would be terribly painful, collapse Sunto to the ground,\nand make it hard to breathe for minutes.\nTo Hilo’s surprise, Sunto dropped the wristlock, Steeled,\nand cross-Channeled in one quick twist of his upper body,\ndispelling the attack and sending a muscle-cramping pain\nshooting into the socket of the Pillar’s shoulder. The blast to\nSunto’s chest was still enough to double him up coughing, but\ndespite having the air knocked out of him, the man did not\nhesitate; he brought a shin up into Hilo’s groin.\nEven Steeling didn’t stop Hilo’s eyes from watering in\nagony as he fell to one knee. Sunto dropped a knife-hand\nstrike toward his carotid artery. Hilo drove himself sideways;\nthe incapacitating blow glanced harmlessly off his shoulder as\nhe hurled a precise horizontal Deflection that clotheslined\nSunto at the waist and knocked him to the ground a few feet\naway. Regaining his footing, the Pillar sprang Light and\nlanded with his full crushing Strength, not on top of Sunto’s\ntorso, but next to him, flattening the mat instead of the man’s\nrib cage.\nSunto rolled to his feet in an instant, crouched defensively,\nbut Hilo stood with a lopsided smile and walked up with his\nhands open, limping and bent forward slightly from the\nradiating pain in his abdomen. “I was wondering if your\nEspenian military training was real, or just a lot of big talk.”\nSunto frowned in confusion. “So you’re not here to kill me\nor beat the shit out of me.”\n“Did I say I was?” Hilo asked.\nSunto straightened slowly and skeptically, wincing and\nrubbing his chest. “The leader of one of the biggest Green\nBone clans shows up unexpectedly to talk? You can’t blame\nme for thinking I might not be walking out of here. A lot of\npeople in this city don’t like Espenian soldiers, even retired\nones with Kekonese ancestry.”\nEvery person in the Seventh Discipline gym had stopped to\nstare at the extraordinary sight of No Peak’s Pillar matching\nhimself against an ex–Navy Angel. Someone was taking out a\ncompact 35 mm camera. Hilo glanced over and snapped,\n“None of that, go back to whatever you were doing. I’m\ntalking to a visitor here, can’t you see that?” The chastised\nFingers mumbled apologies and reluctantly drew away from\nthe scene. Hilo turned back to Sunto. “If you were in trouble\nwith me, you would know it for sure by now. I said I came to\ntalk, didn’t I? There’s a restaurant across the street. I’ll buy\nyou a drink for that kick.”\n_______\nThey had the Two Tigers Taproom to themselves, since the\nplace was not technically open yet.

The ex-Angel’s jade aura was still bristly with\nsuspicion, but he drank his beer and said, “What do you want\nto talk about?”\n“Tell me how you became an Espenian soldier and military\ninstructor.” No Peak had already investigated Sunto’s\nbackground, but Hilo believed you could always learn more\nabout a man by hearing him talk about himself.\nSunto Jimonyon had been born in Janloon and raised by a\nsingle mother. When he was six years old, his mother\nremarried and his stepfather moved the family to Espenia.\nSunto, who did not get along with his stepfather, left home at\nseventeen and joined the ROE military, where he was fast-\ntracked into IBJCS training and the Navy Angels. During his\nsecond tour of duty in Oortoko, he was injured by flying\nshrapnel and sent to Euman Naval Base to recover. While\nthere, he took on duties training new cohorts of Angel cadets\nand became a well-regarded instructor. Facing reassignment at\nthe end of the Oortokon War, Sunto resigned from the Angels,\nelecting to stay in Kekon.\n“I was tired of being ordered around,” he explained with a\nshrug. “I wanted to spend more time living and training here,\nuntil I figure out what to do next.”\n“You were allowed to keep your jade,” Hilo observed.\nSunto put a hand around his dog tags. “It’s not my jade,”\nhe said. “It was issued to me by the Espenian government and\nI have it on indefinite loan because I’m still a contracted\nIBJCS instructor at Euman Naval Base. I live in officer’s\nquarters when I’m over there, and I’ve got an apartment here\nin the city the rest of the time.”\nHilo tilted his head curiously. “You don’t want to duel for\nany green of your own?”\nSunto’s eyes flicked down to the ample line of jade studs\nvisible between the open buttons of Hilo’s collar, then back up\nat the Pillar’s face. “I was taught to carry only the jade I need,”\nhe said. “All of IBJCS is based on stripped-down methods—\nthe most simple and effective reconnaissance and combat\ntechniques that’ll work for special forces soldiers equipped\nwith the same standard issue of bioenergetic jade. Any more\nthan that is an unnecessary risk.” Sunto frowned as he turned\nhis glass of beer, widening a circle of moisture on the table.\n“Some of the guys I was with in Oortoko, they aren’t doing so\nwell now. Mental illness, drug addiction, falling into\nunTruthful habits. I’m lucky to have Kekonese genetics on my\nside, but I don’t need more jade just to show it off.”\n“That’s true.” Hilo’s expression remained neutral as he\nstubbed out his cigarette. “You’re a foreign serviceman, after\nall, not a Green Bone.”\nSunto eyed the Pillar with caution and impatience. He\npushed aside his beer and crossed his arms on the table.\n“Look, I know what a big deal your family is,” he said, in a\nmatter-of-fact tone that made it clear he was not stupid, that"

My word on the Seer’s Truth.\nI’m here to mind my own business and to make some decent\nmoney, that’s all.”\nUnexpectedly, Hilo decided he liked Jim Sunto. Protected\nby his Espenian citizenship and military status, Sunto was an\naberration in Janloon. He could wear and use jade, but he had\nno allegiance to any clan and took no shit either. A man who\ncould kick the Pillar in the groin without fear of death was\nrefreshing. It reminded Hilo of a much earlier time in his life,\nwhen he was not yet the Pillar or even the Horn, when anyone\ncould challenge him and he had to earn respect daily with\nwords or fists or knives. “I’m glad to hear that,” he said, with a\ngrowing smile.\n“Well then,” Sunto said, finishing his beer and shifting his\nchair back to stand, “now that we’ve both had a chance to\nclear things up, I assume we’re done here.”\n“Sit down, Lieutenant.” Even though Sunto was no longer\nan enlisted officer, military rank seemed the most appropriate\nway to address him. “Do you think I’d go to the trouble of\nfinding you in person just to growl at you like a big dog?” Hilo\npointed the man back into his seat. “You said you’re here to\nmake money. I have a way for you to make a lot more. Do you\nwant to hear about it or not?”\nSunto was not the first man to be startled by the Pillar’s\nsudden change from relaxed good humor to pointed authority.\nHe lowered himself warily back into his chair.\nHilo had the manager of the Two Tigers Taproom bring the\nman another beer. “What do you know about the Kekonese\nmilitary?” the Pillar asked.\n“When I was in the Angels, we did some training exercises\nwith the Kekonese army. They’re not shoddy, exactly, but\nunderwhelming for a country with the most bioenergetic jade\nin the world.”\n“That’s because the clans take all the jade and warriors,\nand some of them don’t care about the country.” Hilo’s lips\ntwisted sarcastically. “At least, that’s what I’ve heard.”\nIt infuriated Hilo that Ayt Mada had outmaneuvered him in\nthe KJA meeting at the beginning of the year, in front of every\nother Green Bone leader in the country. Since then, the\nMountain had predictably and relentlessly attacked No Peak in\nthe battlefield of public opinion. Even though the KJA had\nrecently voted unanimously to increase the allocation of jade\nto the armed forces, and No Peak loyalists in the Royal\nCouncil had helped to pass greater funding for national\ndefense, if one were to believe Koben Yiro’s zealous rants on\nthe radio, Ygutan was on the verge of invading the country all\nbecause of No Peak’s craven selfishness."

Shae’s latest reports showed that so far this year, two-\nthirds of newly incorporated small businesses were seeking\npatronage from the Mountain over No Peak. Woon Papidonwa\nwas working full time to manage the clan’s public image and\noutside relationships, but as Shae had put it, You can’t sell thin\nair. No Peak needed substantial political wins of its own.\n“Let me get this straight,” Jim Sunto said slowly, after Hilo\nexplained his offer. “You want to hire me to help reform the\nKekonese military?”\nHilo said, “You’ve been teaching IBJCS to Espenian Navy\nAngels and interested Green Bones on the side. The Kekonese\nmilitary could use someone like you, to show them how to\nmake the most of the jade they have. There’s no denying that\nforeigners have done some things that even Green Bones can\nlearn from.”\nSunto sat back, arms crossed, chewing the inside of his\ncheek. “I’ll admit that’s not what I expected to hear from a\nclan Pillar. I know the ROE military brass also believes a\nstronger Kekonese army would be a deterrent against Ygutan.”\nHe fingered the triangular pendant around his neck, as if\nconsulting his foreign God as well as his selfinterest. “When\nwould I meet this General Ronu?”\n_______\nWen prepared a dinner of crab soup, peppered sea bass, pea\nshoots with garlic, and stuffed buns. She had help from\nKyanla, but was proud to have done most of the cooking\nherself, even though it had taken hours. She still suffered\noccasional numbness and weakness on the right side of her\nbody, but her balance and motor control had greatly improved,\nand she’d gradually become adept at doing things one-handed.\nWhen Hilo arrived home, he found her waiting in the\ndining room, wearing a soft blue dress and pearl necklace, the\nelaborate dinner for two laid out on the table.\n“What’s this about?” he said.\n“I thought it would… be nice to have dinner together.\nAlone, for once.”\nHer husband took off his suit jacket and weapons, dropped\nhis keys and wallet on the kitchen counter, then sat down at\nthe table with an air of bemused suspicion. He glanced around\nthe uncharacteristically quiet house. “Where are the kids?”\n“I sent … Niko to sleep over at the Juens. Ru and Jaya are\nat your mother’s house.”\n“Jaya’s going to be furious.” The three-and-a-half-year-old\nhad strict ideas about how her bedtime routine was expected to\nproceed, beginning with an evening snack and ending with her\nfather reading from a big book of children’s stories about the\nhero Baijen.

She was liable to throw a tantrum that could be\nPerceived, and possibly heard, from across the courtyard of the\nestate.\n“She has to learn she … doesn’t always get what she\nwants.” Wen carefully ladled soup into two bowls,\nconcentrating on keeping her arm steady. She worried about\nher children growing up spoiled or neglected, in some\ncombination. They had relatives to care for them when she\ncould not, but they still suffered from her inability to be a\nmore attentive mother. She could not carry them, or run\naround with them, or even tie their shoelaces.\nHilo tasted the soup and said, “It’s good,” almost\ngrudgingly. They ate in silence for a few minutes, but she\ncould feel Hilo’s eyes on her.\n“That’s the dress you wore when we were married,” he\nsaid.\nWen smiled at his notice. “Does it still look good?” She\nwas wearing support pantyhose and a padded bra under the\nsilk. Birthing and nursing two children, and then loss of\nmuscle function from traumatic brain damage, meant that the\nbody inside the dress was not the one from six and a half years\nago.\n“Sure.” A softness came into Hilo’s eyes. “Maybe not\nquite as good as it looked the first time, only because I thought\nI’d die the next day. Everything’s more beautiful when you\ndon’t think you’ll see it again.”\n“Sometimes,” Wen said as she took the lid off the fish\nplate, “it’s more beautiful afterward, when you … realize you\nhave a second ch-chance.” She fumbled the spoon; nerves.\nHilo reached across the table and took the serving utensils\nfrom her. He placed some of the sea bass and pea shoots on\nher plate, but his movements grew sharp; he cut into the fish as\nif it were still alive and had to be killed. His voice had been\nkind, but now it held a pained edge. “There aren’t any real\nsecond chances. Even when you live through the worst parts,\nlife doesn’t go back to what it was before.” He sat back in his\nseat, scraping the legs noisily against the floor. “Just look at\nTar. There are some things a person can’t recover from.”\nWen squeezed her hands together in her lap, reminding\nherself that this was what she’d wanted—an honest\nconversation with her husband. “Tar and Iyn Ro shouldn’t get\nmarried,” she said. “They’re not good for each other.”\n“They’ve been hot and cold for years,” Hilo grumbled.\n“Now they promise me they’re finally serious enough to take\noaths to each other, so why shouldn’t I let them have their\nchance? Tar needs more people in his life, more things to do.”\nTar had been staying over at the main residence so often that\nhe’d practically moved in with them, but after he and Iyn Ro\nhad gotten engaged last month, he’d been spending most of his\ntime with her in his apartment in Sogen.\nWen knew that Hilo had reduced his Pillarman’s duties,\nhad told him to take time off to relax, saying it was well\nearned after his travel to Espenia and accomplishing such\ndifficult tasks there.

That was true, but the real reason was that\nAnden had returned from his own trip to Port Massy and told\nthe Pillar of his conversation with Dauk Losun.\n“Hilo-jen,” Wen had heard Anden say worriedly, the two\nof them standing in the Pillar’s study, “Tar is green turning\nblack.”\nGreen turning black was an idiom for a jade warrior losing\nhis sanity, usually from the Itches, possibly becoming a danger\nto himself and others. Someone like that might have to be\nconfronted, might have to give up his jade or have it forcibly\ntaken from him by intervening clan members. Wen was sure\nthe problem with Tar had nothing to do with jade\noverexposure, however. Without Kehn, he was one wheel\nholding up a runaway rickshaw, his continued devotion to Hilo\na ballast against loneliness and bloodlust. The only thing that\nseemed to make him genuinely happy was spending time with\nthe children, especially Kehn’s son, Maik Cam, but he was so\nprone to filling their heads with violent stories that even Wen,\nwho didn’t believe in shielding children from reality, limited\nhow much time the kids spent with their uncle Tar lest she\nhave them coming into her bedroom at night wide-eyed with\nnightmares.\nTar’s engagement to Iyn Ro last month had come as\nsomething of a surprise. “At least he’s trying to change,” Hilo\npointed out. “Tar deserves to be happy.”\n“And the rest of us?” Wen asked cautiously. “What do we\ndeserve?”\nHilo’s chewing slowed. He eyed her from the side of his\nvision as he reached for the plate of warm stuffed buns. “What\ndo you mean by that?”\nWen twisted the napkin in her lap, gathering her resolve.\n“We … can’t st-stay apart and hurting like this, Hilo,” she\nsaid. “The Pillar has to … keep the family strong. We’re not\nstrong now. We’re stuck. You haven’t …” She couldn’t put her\nchurning thoughts into the exact words she needed, and she\nsaw her halting speech was arousing his pity and making him\nagitated. “What … do you … Do you want a divorce?”\nHilo pushed back in his chair. Wen had never feared her\nhusband before; he had never hit her or even looked as if he\nwould hit her, but the expression on his face now felt as if it\nwould stop her heart. “Is that what you want?” he asked with\nsoft rage. “After all this, you haven’t betrayed me enough,\nnow you’re thinking to break up the family?”\nShe shook her head vigorously, but Hilo’s voice rose, all\nhis anger over the past gathering into a storm, the accusation\nin his eyes rendering her speechless. “Why, Wen? Haven’t I\nalways loved you and taken care of you, supported your\ncareer, done everything I could to keep you and our children\nsafe? And you couldn’t obey me, in only one, simple way?”\nWen had been determined to face her husband without\ntears, but now her vision blurred against her will. “There was\ntoo … much at stake.

He stood up, tossing his napkin down.\n“Sometimes I think liars are almost as bad as thieves,” he said\nthrough a tight jaw. “They steal away trust, something that\ncan’t be returned.” Before she could even rise from her chair,\nhe left the house, his quick, sure movements and long strides\neasily outpacing hers.\n_______\nHilo stormed out the door and got into the Duchesse, only to\nrealize that in the heat of the moment, he’d left his car keys in\nthe house along with his jacket, weapons, and wallet. He\nhowled in frustration and banged the steering wheel, then\nrolled down the window and smoked three cigarettes in a row\nbefore he felt calm again.\nHe considered sleeping in the car tonight. Then he thought\nabout walking over to the Weather Man’s house and asking his\nsister to let him spend the night on her sofa. Both ideas struck\nhim as so pathetic that he laughed out loud in the dark.\nImagining the withering look that Shae would give him was\namusing and sobering at the same time. Although—something\nhad happened lately between her and Woon. She was\ndistracted and unhappy, so perhaps they could get drunk\ntogether for the first time in their lives and both cry into their\ncups of hoji. Hilo chuckled again.\nWhen he’d walked into the house that evening and seen\nWen looking so beautiful, waiting for him with a meal she’d\nput such effort into preparing, he’d wanted nothing more than\nto give his heart back to her completely, to make amends for\nevery harsh moment between them. It had once been an\neffortless thing to tell his wife he loved her—three simple\nwords in a single breath. A goodbye at the end of a phone call,\nan invitation to make love, a whisper before sleep.\nNow it seemed an impassable emotional mountain. Every\ntime he longed to make things right with Wen, anger yanked\nhim back, like a hand jerking away from flame or Steel rising\nagainst a blade. How often had he found fault with Shae for\nkeeping people at a distance—for half the time not being\nhonest with herself, and half the time not being honest with\nothers? Now he was the one sealed off, nursing his invisible\nwounds alone, just as Lan had once done.\nThe thought filled Hilo with gloom and dread. He was not\na naturally self-sufficient personality. He knew that about\nhimself. Perhaps some men truly did not need others, but very\nfew, and there was usually something wrong with them to\nmake them that way. The brotherhood of the clan was a\npromise that its warriors were not alone. What was the point of\nGreen Bone oaths, of all the sacrifices his family had made, of\nthe relentless war against their enemies, if in the end, the\npromise couldn’t even be kept for him and those he loved?\nStill, he delayed.

The hour grew late and he was out of\ncigarettes.\nHilo got out of the car and walked back to the house with\nheavy steps. A stalemate was no way to live in a marriage, that\nmuch he was forced to admit. The idea of divorce had nearly\nmade his vision turn red and his head feel as if it were on fire.\nSo that was not an option. He wasn’t sure he could forgive his\nwife, or his sister—but Anden had once said that\nunderstanding was more important than forgiveness. His kid\ncousin could be canny, in his own way.\nThe lights in the house were out, but his eyes were already\nadjusted to the dark. Wen had put away the remains of the\ndinner and fallen asleep on the sofa in the living room, curled\non her side under a throw blanket. Perhaps she’d been waiting\nfor him, or perhaps the staircase had seemed too daunting.\nHilo stood over her, watching the soft rise and fall of her pale\nshoulders in time with her breaths. She was the softest and\nmost vulnerable creature; she was the strongest and most\nunyielding of his warriors.\nHe bent and gathered her easily in his arms. As he carried\nher up the stairs and into the bedroom, she woke and\nmurmured, groggily, “Hilo? What time is it?”\n“It’s late,” he answered. “But not too late.” He laid her\ndown on the bed and sat down on the mattress next to her.\n“I’m sorry about dinner. It was good, one of your best. But\nthere’ll be others, even better I’m sure. Or we’ll go out next\ntime.”\nShe said quietly, “All right.” She wiped her eyes with the\nbacks of her hands.\n“I shouldn’t have lost my temper and left the house like\nthat, but I didn’t go anywhere—just out to the car.” He leaned\nover and brushed away the strands of hair stuck to her cheeks.\nThe gesture was gentle, but his voice was not. “I think maybe\nmistakes made out of love are the worst sort, and we’ve both\nmade them. Don’t ever talk about divorce again. I won’t bring\nit up myself. Understand?” She nodded.\nHe undressed her, then took off his own clothes and got\ninto bed next to her. Slowly, but firmly, he began to touch her\nstomach and breasts, her hips and buttocks. He reached\nbetween her thighs, drawing short strokes with his fingers as\nhe brought his lips to her jaw.\nWen turned toward him and pressed her wet face to his\nchest and stomach.

Afterward, they didn’t speak,\nbut slept with their fingers laced together in the darkness.\nCHAPTER\n10\nYou Can’t Win\nthe sixth year, tenth month\nS\nhae opted to take the five-hour-long train ride to Lukang.\nThe business-class train cars were more comfortable than\nKekon Air’s regional planes, and she could spend the time\nenjoying the passing countryside and getting work done.\nShe reviewed all that she’d learned about the Six Hands\nUnity clan with her new chief of staff, Luto Tagunin. Over the\npast six months, Luto had proven himself to be a fast learner,\nhighly organized, and relentlessly energetic. He did not seem\nto need much sleep. The twenty-six-year-old worked late, went\nout carousing with friends, and seemed none the worse for it\nearly the following morning. He was already adeptly\nnavigating the complexity of the business side of the clan, and\nShae had been impressed by his attention to detail.\nThe one thing that was likely to hold Luto back from\nadvancement in the clan was the fact that he was not a Green\nBone. That was not a strict barrier to most jobs on the business\nside of No Peak, but would be seen as a disadvantage at the\nupper levels of leadership and would shut him out of certain\nsocial circles. Overall, Shae was not in any specific way\ndisappointed with Luto, except for the glaring and inescapable\nfact that he was not Woon Papidonwa.\nLuto was not as thoughtful and experienced as Woon. He\ndidn’t have Woon’s calm presence and he didn’t anticipate her\nthoughts the way Woon seemed to. Luto couldn’t Perceive\nwhen she needed him to appear in her office to discuss a\ndifficult issue, he didn’t know when and how to challenge her\ndecisions or poke holes in her logic, he didn’t wait to drive her\nhome at the end of every workday.\nShae reminded herself that she was having difficulty\nadjusting because until recently, she’d had the same chief of\nstaff since becoming Weather Man. It would take time to\nbecome accustomed to someone else in the role. It wasn’t as if\nshe didn’t see Woon anymore. His new office was only one\nfloor below hers, and they still spoke nearly every day. The\nclan’s Sealgiver was busy handling the public announcement\nthat No Peak was partnering with the Kekonese military and\nbringing in IBJCS experts to design a more robust and modern\ntraining program in the jade disciplines. Whenever Shae\npassed by the office of the Weather Man’s Shadow down the\nhall from her own and felt a stab of disappointment to see it\noccupied by Luto instead of Woon, she would find some\nexcuse to descend one floor simply to get close enough to\nPerceive his familiar aura.\nAfter the kiss they’d shared in her house, Shae had\nmustered the courage to go to Woon’s new office on Firstday\nmorning. She was the Weather Man, after all, the higher-\nranked Green Bone. She ought to resolve the situation. “Papi-"

She ought to resolve the situation. “Papi-\njen,” she said determinedly, walking in and shutting the door\nbehind her. “About last week, I—”\nBefore she could get out another word, Woon stood up,\nnearly knocking over his own chair. “Don’t say anything else,\nShae-jen.” He stared at her for only a few seconds before\naverting his eyes, as if she were standing in front of a\nfloodlight and it was hard for him to look directly at her. He\nlowered his voice. “You know how I feel about you. If you\napologize for what happened and tell me you didn’t mean any\nof it, it’ll be unbearable to me. If you tell me that you did\nmean it and you feel the same way, that would be even worse,\nbecause if I thought there was a chance …” The knob of his\nthroat bobbed and his jade aura churned with conflicted\nfeelings, a riot of textures that Shae couldn’t parse. “I can’t\nleave Kiya. It wouldn’t be honorable of me. Not after\neverything we’ve been through. And I can’t stand the idea of\nlosing your respect and friendship either. Would it … would it\nbe possible for us to keep working together and just … try not\nto let it get in the way?”\nHe raised his eyes fully to hers at last, and Shae almost\nwished he hadn’t, because his soft, sincere expression tugged\nat her insides in painfully hungry ways. She stood in his office\nat a respectable distance in her business suit and thought of his\nlips on her neck, his large hands climbing up under her shirt.\nIn that moment, she realized what a fool she was, to have\nfinally fallen for her colleague and friend when it was too late.\nShe managed an answer. “Of course.”\nTrue to his word, Woon had overseen Luto’s work as they\ncarefully verified the sincerity of the overture from Six Hands\nUnity, thoroughly examined the smaller clan’s finances and\noperations, and finally arranged for a secure and private\nmeeting with its leaders. She’d spoken to him on the phone\nbefore she got on the train.\n“Are you sure you have all the information you need,\nShae-jen?” he asked her. They both knew how important this\nmeeting would be. If Shae returned with the allegiance of Six\nHands Unity, everything would change. They had been\nhypervigilant about secrecy. Only Hilo, Woon, and Juen even\nknew she was making the trip.\n“Yes,” Shae assured him. “Luto’s done a good job\ncompiling everything.”\nWoon hesitated on the other end of the line. He could’ve\neasily walked up one floor in the office tower to see her before\nshe left, but he’d phoned instead. She’d half expected him to\noffer to make the trip to Lukang with her, as he normally\nwould’ve as her Shadow, but he didn’t do that either. She tried\nand abjectly failed not to be hurt by his entirely appropriate\nprofessional distance. It was better they didn’t see each other\nin person.

Her emotions would’ve been far too easy to\nPerceive.\nOver the phone, it was easier to keep up their shields.\n“Have a good trip, Shae-jen, and good luck,” Woon said, then\nhung up.\nThe train pulled into the station at Lukang late in the\nafternoon. While Janloon, the glamorous capital city, sits\nsmoggy and sheltered by the warm waters and outlying islands\nof Kekon’s curving eastern shore, Lukang, on the country’s\nsouthern coast, is a windswept, seableached city known for its\nsunny skies and unpretentious workingclass character.\nJanlooners consider their southern countrymen to be less\nsophisticated, and make fun of their slow way of talking, but\nLukang stands as a metropolis in its own right, fueled by the\nfactories and telecom companies that have grown up around its\nbustling port.\nA hired car and driver were waiting for Shae and her aide\nas soon as they got off the train. It drove them directly to the\narranged meeting place deep inside Six Hands Unity territory.\nLukang was a city controlled three ways. The Mountain and\nNo Peak both had people and businesses here, but Six Hands\nUnity was the principal regional clan. For over a decade, it had\nmaintained an arm’s-length alliance with the Mountain, paying\ntribute in exchange for continued operational independence\nand access to the Mountain’s greater resources and national\nreach. Shae hoped to change that.\nAt the entrance to the Unto & Sons Restaurant & Hoji Bar,\nthey were met by Jio Wasujo, the Pillar of Six Hands Unity,\nalong with two other men. “Kaul-jen,” said Jio, saluting her\nrespectfully. “I’m honored by your visit.”\n“I’m glad to make the trip, Jio-jen,” Shae said, returning\nthe salute. Jio Wasu was a physically formidable but aging\nGreen Bone. He wore jade on a silver chain around his throat\nbut a bald patch shone on the top of his head and he was a\ntouch overweight. Shae had seen him sitting near Ayt Mada in\nthe Kekon Jade Alliance meetings and noticed he was always\none to watch and listen more than talk.\nJio motioned to the two men standing with him. “You\nknow my Weather Man, Tyne Retu.” Shae nodded toward\nTyne. They had been in discreet contact a number of times\nsince their brief conversation in the elevator. Jio introduced the\nthird, younger man as “my Horn and nephew, Jio Somu.”\nShae and Luto were ushered politely but quickly into one\nof the bar’s private rooms, where long shelves on the walls\nheld display bottles of fine hoji of different distilleries and\nages. The place was not yet open for the evening, and Shae’s\nPerception told her no one else was in the building. The\nwooden shutters were closed, blocking what would’ve been an\nexcellent view of the Amaric Ocean off the city’s lengthy\nseawall.\n“Stay out front and keep watch,” Jio Wasu told his nephew.\nThe Horn nodded and departed to do so. “I apologize for not"

Luto positioned his seat behind and to the left\nof her. Tyne Retu served the tea, pouring Shae’s cup first. Shae\nate some of the roasted nuts and pickled vegetables to be\npolite, but she was anxious to get on with the discussion and\nhad little appetite.\nJio and Tyne seemed to feel the same way. After some\nsmall talk about the weather in the south versus the north, and\nmutual inquiries into the health of their respective families, the\nPillar of Six Hands Unity shifted forward and said, in his slow,\nsouthern cadence, “Kauljen, I appreciate you taking the time to\ncome to Lukang. We’re not as big as Janloon, so sometimes\npeople don’t realize how much our city has to offer.”\nShae said, “I would be a poor Weather Man if I didn’t\nalready know that Lukang is growing even faster than Janloon\nthese days.”\n“The Six Hands Unity clan has had a partnership with the\nMountain since Ayt Yugontin’s time,” Jio said, “but lately\nwe’ve been faced with”—he exchanged glances with his\nWeather Man—“issues that have made me rethink what’s best\nfor my clan.”\nShae hoped her Shadow was paying close attention. She\nwas used to having Woon’s reassuring jade aura right behind\nher and wished it wasn’t absent in what might be a pivotal\nnegotiation. She leaned forward to match Jio and said\nencouragingly, “What sort of issues are you facing, Jio-jen?”\nJio said, “Lukang is growing, but that also means big-city\ntroubles. We’re the nearest major port to the Uwiwa Islands, so\nwe’ve always had problems with jade smuggling and illegal\nSN1, but it’s gotten worse. Many of the refugees from Oortoko\nthat came to Kekon over the past few years settled here, with\nthe Mountain’s sponsorship. Some of them are good citizens,\nbut some are barukan who deal in shine and commit other\ncrimes. Six Hands Unity is not a large clan. We don’t have\nenough Green Bones to police the barukan. We’ve asked the\nMountain to send more of their Fists and Fingers, but they\nprioritize their territories in Janloon.”\nJio had begun speaking slowly, but now he picked up\nspeed. “Ayt Mada has barukan working for her—members of\nthe Matyos, the largest of the gangs in Shotar. They take\ndelivery of jade that arrives in Lukang and transport it under\nguard to Janloon. So the Mountain is lenient on their other\nactivities.”\nShae was confused. “Jade arrives in Lukang?” she said.\n“From where? The mines?” To her knowledge, none of the\nKJA-controlled jade processing facilities were located in the\narea."

The mines?” To her knowledge, none of the\nKJA-controlled jade processing facilities were located in the\narea.\nAgain, Jio glanced at his Weather Man. Their jade auras\nseemed to tauten. Shae sensed that the leaders of Six Hands\nUnity had debated long and hard about whether to share this\ninformation with her. “We were surprised as well, at first,” Jio\nsaid. “Usually, we’re worried about jade going the other way,\nbeing smuggled out of the country. That’s still happening, but\nthe opposite is happening too—jade has been arriving by ship\nor plane from the Uwiwa Islands.”\n“Why would—” Shae began, then stopped before she\ncould finish the question: Why would jade be brought into\nKekon—the country it came from in the first place? The\nanswer struck her in an instant.\nFour years ago, after No Peak assassinated the Uwiwan\nsmuggler Zapunyo, Ayt had struck an alliance with the Keko-\nShotarian mercenaries who’d been employed as Zapunyo’s\nbodyguards and enforcers. A barukan man named Iyilo,\noriginally from the Matyos gang and one of Zapunyo’s\nlongtime aides, had killed Zapunyo’s sons and taken over his\nassets in the Uwiwa Islands to become the leader of Ti\nPasuiga, the largest jade and shine smuggling ring in the\nregion, which he now operated with as much ruthlessness as\nhis predecessor. While the Green Bone clans had largely\neradicated organized scrap picking from Kekon’s mines, an\ninevitable amount of raw and cut jade was still ferreted away\nby enterprising criminals.\nAnd according to Jio Wasu, the Mountain was buying it\nback.\nTo cement the alliance with Iyilo and the Matyos barukan,\nAyt had whispered the name of the former Royal Council\nchancellor Son Tomarho, ensuring the passage of legislation\nallowing refugees from war-torn Oortoko—including jade-\nwearing barukan sponsored by the Mountain—to immigrate to\nKekon, where Ayt had put them to work. Buying back raw\njade from the Uwiwa Islands, bringing it into Lukang, and\nplacing it in the Mountain’s stores not only buttressed the\nclan’s wealth against uncertainty in the financial markets, it\nconstricted the supply and inflated the price of illegal jade.\nWith jade prices high, the Mountain’s unofficial sales to\nYgutan, East Oortoko, and other countries would be far more\nprofitable. Shae was also certain that Ayt was taking a cut of\nTi Pasuiga’s shine trade, as well as whatever black market\nrocks it didn’t repatriate but instead allowed to reach other\nbuyers.\nAyt Mada, who’d always believed in one clan controlling\nthe global jade supply, had found a way to bring much of the\nblack market jade trade under her purview, creating what\namounted to a black market shadow of the KJA, with only one\nclan—the Mountain—in the cartel.\nIn the Twice Lucky, with Fuyin’s body on the table, Hilo\nhad demanded to know, How the fuck is the Mountain\noutspending us and stealing our businesses with tribute rates"

Now Shae knew the answer.\nThe key to Ayt Mada’s war chest was here in Lukang.\nHer heart began to pound. She forced composure back into\nher body, not wanting the men to Perceive how important it\nwas that she win them over. Ayt no doubt considered some\ndisorder and crime in Lukang a small price to pay for ensuring\nthat the barukan gangs remained her cooperative partners in\ncontrolling the illegal jade triangle that now existed between\nKekon, the Uwiwa Islands, and Ygutan. If No Peak could ally\nwith Six Hands Unity to seize incoming jade at the ports, she\ncould deprive the Mountain of its stockpile and drive a wedge\nbetween Ayt and Iyilo. She said, calmly, “Jio-jen, I knew the\nMountain was allied with the barukan, but I didn’t realize until\nnow that it was to such an extent as to cause harm to your\ncity.”\nJio blew out a troubled breath. “The Mountain is never\ngoing to care about the city of Lukang the way Six Hands\nUnity does. I want our local Lantern Men to be able to expand\ntheir businesses overseas. That’s where the growth\nopportunities are now. And we need to attract foreign\ninvestment and international tourism to our city. My own son\nwants to go to graduate school in Espenia.” The Pillar eyed\nShae with a question in his eyes. “It’s my understanding that\nthe No Peak clan has advantages over the Mountain in those\nareas.”\nShae gave a single nod, keeping her excitement in check.\n“You’ve understood correctly, Jio-jen. We have more assets\nand allies in Espenia than any other clan. If Six Hands Unity\nwere to swear allegiance and tribute, No Peak would gladly\noffer our friendship and support to you in every way we can.”\nToo late, she wished she hadn’t been too proud to insist that\nHilo come on the trip with her, to lend his natural\npersuasiveness. “As Weather Man of the clan, I speak on\nbehalf of my brother the Pillar, who’s known for keeping his\npromises.”\nA keyed-up sense of momentum was rising in the room.\nJio knew full well that he was on the verge of taking an\nirrevocable step. By changing allegiances, he would make an\nenemy of Ayt Mada, something no sane person would want, in\nthe hopes of bettering the prospects for his clan and his city.\n“The friendship of the No Peak clan is worth a great deal,” he\nacknowledged. “We’re a small clan in comparison, and don’t\nhave a great many Fists and Fingers, but the ones we do have\nare as green as they come. We have a strong regional presence\nand healthy businesses across several industries. Tyne-jen can\nprovide every detail you need.”\nThe Weather Man of Six Hands Unity acted promptly on\nthis cue and opened a briefcase.

Inside would be details of the clan’s operations:\nrecent financial statements of its wholly owned and tributary\nbusinesses, a roster of the clan’s leadership, an accounting of\nhow many Green Bones it commanded and what their ranks\nwere, and any other noteworthy assets the clan possessed, such\nas alliances with other minor clans or valuable political\nconnections.\nOf course, Woon and Luto had already dug up as much\ninformation as they could about Six Hands Unity from No\nPeak’s own sources, so there would likely not be anything in\nTyne’s report to surprise her, but the disclosure step was a sign\nof intention and trust. She expected Jio and Tyne would not be\none hundred percent honest—tributary entities might\ndownplay their income in hopes of lower tribute rates, or\nconversely, pad their claims of wealth or warriors to make\nthemselves more attractive to allies. She would have Luto\ncorroborate the facts and examine the statements for any\ndiscrepancies, but the important thing was that the Pillar of Six\nHands Unity had come prepared to switch his clan, and thus\nLukang, to No Peak rule.\nShae accepted the envelope and placed it inside her bag. “I\nhave no doubt of your word. You’re taking a risk for your clan\nand city. Let me assure you that No Peak is loyal to its friends,\nand we’re not without our own power in Lukang.” She held a\nhand out to Luto, who immediately placed an unmarked\nenvelope of their own into her outstretched palm. She set the\nenvelope in front of Jio and Tyne. It contained a draft\nagreement of patronage, including how many warriors Juen\nNu, the Horn of No Peak, had agreed to redeploy to Lukang to\ndefend Six Hands Unity from potential retaliation by the\nMountain (no tributary would switch allegiance unless it could\ncount on protection) as well as an approximate tribute range,\nto be finalized pending closer inspection of the smaller clan’s\nbooks.\n“I’ve run the numbers based on last year’s information, so\nthese are only estimates. I can provide everyone with an\nupdated proposal within the week,” Luto assured them. “With\nthe Weather Man’s permission,” he added hastily and with\nembarrassment. Shae had not technically given her chief of\nstaff license to speak, but she forgave his enthusiasm. The\nyoung man was nearly vibrating. This was the sort of dramatic\nevent Luto must’ve hoped he would witness when he became\nthe Weather Man’s Shadow. The alliance would not be official\nuntil the details had been agreed upon by both sides and Jio\ncame up to Janloon to swear oaths to Kaul Hilo in person, but\nthe clans had declared their intentions. It was a huge victory\nfor No Peak. Things would have to be set into motion\nimmediately.\nJio accepted the envelope and began to speak again, but\nbefore the words left his mouth, Shae’s Perception caught a\nshift of energy outside of the building. Green Bone jade auras\napproaching, fast. Half a dozen of them at least.

Jio Somu, the Horn of\nSix Hands Unity, stood in the entryway. Next to him was a tall,\nolder man that Shae recognized at once as Nau Suenzen, Horn\nof the Mountain.\nShae’s hand went for the talon knife strapped to the small\nof her back under her blazer, but Jio Wasu stood frozen,\nstaring at his nephew in uncomprehending shock. The young\nman was sweating, but his face was resolved and his jade aura\nblazed with dark determination. “I’m sorry, Uncle,” he said.\n“You left me no choice.”\nNau Suen took a step into the room and four additional\nMountain Green Bones came in after him, fanning out to either\nside. Shae could Perceive three others in the building, at the\nfront and rear entrances. She edged away and pulled Luto with\nher by the arm, putting their backs against the wall.

She\ncast about for some means of escape and found none. The\nwalls were made of thick wooden timbers and the windows\nwere small—she wouldn’t be able to crash through them with\nany amount of Strength and Steel.\nJio Wasu’s eyes were still on his nephew. “You betrayed\nus,” he whispered in disbelief.\n“That’s an ironic accusation coming from a clan Pillar who\nhas just been caught breaking his tribute oaths and turning to\nNo Peak,” said Nau Suen, his cool, unblinking gaze scanning\nthe room, settling on each occupant in turn. Shae’s skin\ncrawled as he nodded at her, almost cordially, before turning\nback to Jio Wasu. “You ought to know, Jio-jen, that your\nnephew told me of your treachery and provided the date and\nlocation of this meeting on the condition that you be spared\nfrom execution.”\n“The Mountain would’ve found out soon enough,” Jio\nSomu said to his uncle, as if imploring him to understand.\n“And then we would’ve had to fight for our lives. What makes\nyou think we’d be better off with No Peak? It’s better for\neveryone this way. We don’t want Lukang to turn into\nJanloon.”\n“What do you get out of this, Somu?” Jio Wasu asked\nnumbly.\nNau answered for the young Horn. “Naturally, after you’ve\nbeen exiled, Jio Somu will become the Pillar of Six Hands\nUnity, which will continue to run the city of Lukang as a loyal\ntributary of the Mountain clan.”\nTyne Retu made a noise of incoherent rage. “Somu, you"

Two of\nNau Suen’s Green Bones seized the Weather Man of Six\nHands Unity in an instant. A third put a moon blade through\nhis chest. Shae saw the tip of white metal emerge from the left\nside of Tyne’s back at the same instant that she Perceived the\nspasm of his punctured heart like a shriek in her mind.\nJio Wasu let out a roar of denial and tore a small handgun\nfrom a concealed shoulder holster under his jacket. Before he\ncould even aim it, Nau Suen’s men unloaded their weapons in\nunison. The room erupted in gunfire. Jio threw up a violent\nblast of Deflection and Steel that could not possibly save him\nin these tight quarters against so much flying ammunition;\nbullets swerved in every direction. Bottles of hoji shattered\nand crashed off the shelves, spraying glass across the room.\nShae hurled a tight vertical prow of Deflection into the\nnarrow space between two of the Mountain Green Bones,\nknocking them staggering and driving a wedge into the\nMountain’s line. Desperate Strength and Lightness surged into\nShae’s limbs. With her grip still on Luto’s arm, she leapt for\nthe opening, plowing through the chaos—and stumbled as\nLuto’s weight dragged her down. She turned in time to see him\nhit the ground, the side of his neck blown open.\nShae’s mind recoiled, barely registering the sight before\nher right leg buckled under her and a searing pain tore through\nher thigh, radiating down her leg and up into her pelvis. She\nSteeled in a panic and tried to rise. Nau Suen threw a precise,\nforceful Deflection that hit Shae in the chest like a hard shove.\nShe slammed unceremoniously into the back wall and\ncrumpled.\nThe gunfire had stopped, but Shae could not hear a thing.\nShe might as well have been underwater. Jio Wasu lay\nsprawled on the ground next to his Weather Man, his body\nriddled with bullets. Jio Somu, the disloyal nephew, stared at\nhis uncle’s corpse with a ghastly, contorted expression. Even\nthough he hadn’t personally pulled the trigger, from this\nmoment on, he would be known as a man who’d murdered his\nown Pillar and kin.\nThe man’s hands curled into fists by his sides. Shae saw\nhis lips move, trembling. “You should’ve listened to me, old\nman.” Two Mountain Green Bones tugged Jio Somu out of the\nroom.\nShae looked over at Luto, her chief of staff for all of six\nmonths.

Shae forced herself to\nfocus, to meet the Horn’s disconcertingly piercing gaze. “You\nrealize, Naujen,” she said, licking her dry lips, and managing a\npained but venomous smile, “that there’s no way to make my\ndeath here look like a heart attack.”\nThe Horn looked at her with a curious, unsmiling\nexpression. “If you die here, Kaul Hiloshudon will come down\nfrom the forest, and our clans will be at war in the streets by\ntomorrow morning. That’s not what Ayt-jen sent me to\naccomplish in Lukang. I came here to punish a traitor, and to\nsecure the city for the Mountain. Guns are messy, ridiculous\nweapons, though—flying metal and Deflections everywhere.”\nHis eyes traveled from her face down to her leg. “The bullet\nmissed your femoral artery. You’re lucky.”\nShae turned her chin toward Luto’s body. “You can’t say\nthe same for him.”\n“You brought a man with no jade into a meeting of Green\nBone clans.” Nau didn’t even look at the body. “Carelessness.\nLike letting a child play in the middle of a busy street.” A\nsurge of remorse and hatred pounded in Shae’s head. She\nwondered where her talon knife was, whether she could still\nget to Nau.\n“You’re welcome to try,” said the Horn, as if she had\nspoken aloud. “I’m retiring next year. I stayed on as long as I\ndid for Ayt-jen, but the Horn is a young man’s job.” Nau\nturned over his shoulder and gave quick orders to his men,\ninstructing them to take Jio Somu away from the premises for\nhis own protection and to return the jadestripped bodies of Jio\nWasu and Tyne Retu to their families. They left at once to do\nso.\nNau took three cloth napkins from the table and tied them\ntogether with strong knots.

He jammed a pair of\nchopsticks through two layers of the makeshift wrapping and\ntwisted several times, cinching the tourniquet tight with the\nmatter-of-fact efficiency of an army field medic. Nau must be\nnearly sixty. As a teenager, he’d been a resistance fighter\nduring the Shotarian occupation, a comrade of Ayt Yu and her\nown grandfather. Despite his inhumanly high level of skill in\nPerception, he made no effort to use medical Channeling.\nPerhaps he’d only ever learned how to use his jade abilities to\nend lives, not preserve them.\n“Tell your Pillar,” Shae said, clenching her fists in the\nfolds of her skirt to distract from the pain and the growing\nnumbness in her leg, “that she hasn’t won. I know what’s she\ndoing and I’m going to stop her.”\nNau Suen stood and looked down at Shae lying propped\nagainst the wall, drawing ragged breaths. He spoke leisurely as\nhe wiped the blood from his hands on a clean edge of the\ntablecloth. “When Ayt Yugontin—let the gods recognize him\n—was on his deathbed, his son, his Horn, and a number of his\nclose advisors discussed dividing the Mountain clan. After the\nSpear of Kekon was gone, they said, the clan would lose its\nlegendary warrior leader, its heart and soul. It would be best\nfor everyone to go their separate ways, for each of the men\nwho had the support of one faction of the clan to form their\nown, smaller clans, rather than vie for the difficult task of\nfollowing in the great Pillar’s shadow. I was there; I remember\nthe conversation.\n“Ayt Mada was Weather Man at the time. She rarely spoke\nof her birth family, but she said that she remembered her\nparents fighting. One evening her father stormed from the\nhouse, her sister and brother fled to their own friends, and she,\nan eight-year-old child, wandered down to the river. When the\nShotarian bombs fell and the landslide engulfed their village,\nthe rest of her family died apart and alone.”\nNau ate two pieces of the untouched quartered plums and a\nhandful of the roasted nuts remaining on the blood-spattered\ntable. “Madajen told Ayt Yu’s advisors that the strongest Green\nBone among them should become Pillar after her father’s\npassing. She offered to duel any of them for the leadership.\nThey smiled and laughed at the idea. Women did not duel\nmen. I had a better sense of Perception than anyone else, so I\nwas the only one who knew better than to laugh. Ayt Mada\nkilled all those men rather than let the Mountain be broken.”\nOn his way out, the Horn of the Mountain took a moment\nto pick out one of the unbroken bottles of aged hoji left on the\nshelf. He turned over his shoulder, his penetrating gaze falling\nback onto Shae with a touch of cold sympathy. “I’ve known\nher for twenty-five years. You have no choice but to fight, of\ncourse. But you can’t win.”\nNau’s boots crunched on glass as he left the room.\nCHAPTER\n11\nThe Slow War\nS"

But you can’t win.”\nNau’s boots crunched on glass as he left the room.\nCHAPTER\n11\nThe Slow War\nS\nhae dragged herself through the Unto & Sons Restaurant &\nHoji Bar until she found a telephone behind the bar. She called\nthe first number that came into her mind and reached Woon’s\noffice voicemail; the workday was over by now. She phoned\nhis home number. After two rings, Woon’s wife picked up the\ncall.\n“Is Papi there?” Shae asked. “I mean, Woon-jen—is he\nthere?”\n“Who is this?” Kiya asked, instantly suspicious.\n“Kaul Shae, the Weather Man,” Shae said, teeth clenched\nin pain, lying on the floor behind the bar. “I need to talk to\nyour husband, is he—”\nBefore she could finish the sentence, there was a sound on\nthe other end of the line as if the phone was being taken away,\nand then Woon’s voice demanded, anxiously, “Shae-jen?\nWhat’s happened?”\nTen minutes after she got off the phone with Woon, an\nambulance arrived, followed within seconds by a car of No\nPeak Green Bones. Shae recognized one of the Fists, a young\nman from Janloon with wavy hair named Lott, presumably in\nLukang on assignment. “We’ll follow you the entire way to the\nhospital, Kaul-jen,” Lott said, jogging alongside the\nparamedics as they carried Shae out.\n“The Pillar and Weather Man of Six Hands Unity are\ndead,” she said, grabbing the Fist’s arm before she was loaded\ninto the ambulance. “Their Horn betrayed them to the\nMountain. We need to secure our own territories before word\ngets out, and then take as much of Lukang as we can before\nthe Mountain does.”\nAt the hospital, Lott posted guards outside Shae’s room.\nWoon chartered a small plane and was by her bedside two\nhours later. He arrived with Juen Nu and a dozen of the clan’s\nGreen Bone warriors. Sitting up in bed with her swollen leg\nwrapped and elevated, Shae explained the Mountain’s scheme\nof moving black market jade through Lukang and gave the\nHorn the envelope in her bag containing the information about\nthe people and assets of Six Hands Unity—all of them now\nunder questionable ownership.\nBy nightfall, Six Hands Unity was in a state of civil war\nand Lukang was a battlefield. Shae slept restlessly for short\nperiods at a time, Woon always in her room or on the phone in\nthe hallway outside. Every few hours, Iyn Ro or Lott Jin\nwould come back to the hospital to report on what was\nhappening.\n“That shameless kin killer Jio Somu has about two-thirds\nof Six Hands Unity behind him with the Mountain’s support,\nbut the other third and many of their top Lantern Men have\ncome over to us, begging for help and vengeance,” Iyn said,\nshortly after dawn. The Fist’s short, spiky hair was disheveled\nand her aura was bright with adrenaline and new jade.

Shae\nhad heard rumors that Tar’s fiancée was being considered for\npromotion to First Fist, which would make her the first woman\nto achieve such a high rank on the military side of the clan.\n“The bad news is that the Mountain moved into place before\nwe even got here and they have the local barukan gangs on\ntheir side. So they were able to get ahead of us and are still\nholding on to control of most of Six Hands Unity’s former\nterritory.”\n“We can’t win a street war for local businesses,” Woon\nsaid, pacing near the foot of Shae’s bed. “Based on what we\nknow, the most important thing is that we take control of\nLukang’s port and go after the barukan who move jade for the\nMountain.”\n“That’s what we’ve been doing,” Iyn replied with some\nsurliness. Fists did not take well to being told what to do by\nsuits on the business side. “The harbor district is where most\nof the fighting’s concentrated. Juen-jen’s ordered another\nfifteen Green Bones down from Janloon, but any more and we\nrisk leaving our important territories up there undefended.\nWe’ll be lucky just to keep what we currently have in Lukang,\nunless there’s something else the Weather Man’s office can\nthink of?” She arched an eyebrow at Shae and Woon before\nstalking out again.\n_______\nShae was discharged from the hospital after twenty-four hours\nand arrived back home in Janloon at one o’clock in the\nmorning. Woon opened the front door of her house, then came\nback to the car and lifted her out carefully. The pain in Shae’s\nleg had lessened, but she felt weak, and bleary from\npainkillers. She put her arms around Woon’s neck and her\nhead against his shoulder as he carried her inside. It was the\nclosest she’d been to him in months, and the familiar, steadfast\nhum of his jade aura and the solidity of his body comforted\nher. When he settled her on the sofa in the living room, she let\ngo of him reluctantly and felt cold as soon as she did so.\nWoon brought pillows and a blanket down from her\nbedroom and placed them under her head and her wounded leg\nto make her more comfortable. Until she could climb stairs\nagain, she would be better off sleeping on the main level,\nwhere she could more easily get to the kitchen and the\nbathroom. He sat down on the floor beside the sofa and laid\nhis elbow and head down next to her on the cushions,\nexhausted after two days of little sleep. Shae reached out\ntentatively and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Thank you,”\nshe whispered. “Again.”\nWoon placed his hand over hers. With a sigh, he turned his\nhead and brought her hand up to his cheek, pressing his face\nagainst her palm. Her fingers trembled against his skin.\nDespite all that had happened in the past thirty-six hours, an\nache of want arose in her, so intense it seemed a physical\nthing, a hook through her navel. The tenor of Woon’s jade aura\ndeepened and he looked at her with a helpless question in his\neyes. When she pulled him closer, he gave in with no\nresistance."

Shae’s vision blurred; she\nforgot her injury and her fatigue. Woon’s mouth moved with\nslow, deep neediness. Rising up on his knees, he leaned over\nher, supporting her under the head with one arm. His other\nhand touched her throat, then her chest. Shae arched toward\nhim. Still kissing her, he undid the top buttons of her shirt.\nAlmost fearfully it seemed, as if wading into certain danger, he\nbegan touching her breasts over her bra, closing his eyes as he\nbrushed warm fingers over the hardened nipples straining\nagainst fabric.\nWith a groan, Woon drew his hands and mouth away and\nsank back down next to her, dropping his forehead to the sofa\ncushions. Shae hung on to him for a second, then let go.\n“It’s no use,” he murmured, his voice muffled beside her.\n“I can’t help that I’m in love with you.”\nShae sagged against the sofa and reached for his hand. “I\nhave no right to ask you for anything. I won’t.”\nHilo walked into the house. Shae and Woon had not been\npaying attention to anything besides each other and failed to\nPerceive the Pillar’s approach before he was standing in the\nentrance of the living room with an impassive glare.\nWoon got to his feet hastily and blinked a few times before\nbringing his hands up to his forehead in salute. “Kaul-jen.” He\ncleared his throat.\n“Go back to your home and your wife, Woon,” Hilo\nordered.\nWoon flinched as if the Pillar had struck him. His face\nflushed more deeply than Shae had ever seen. For an extended\nmoment, he seemed to struggle with the desire to explain\nhimself; then, with a visible effort, he regained his usual\ncomposure. He nodded once, curtly, and walked past Hilo, out\nof the house to his car.\nShae’s face burned as she turned away and did up the\nbuttons of her shirt. She pushed herself angrily into a sitting\nposition. “Why did you have to barge in like that and treat him\nso harshly?”\n“Do you think what you’re doing is kind to him?” Hilo\nreplied without any remorse. “Are you planning to break his\nheart, or ruin his life?”\nShae mumbled, “Of course not.”\nHilo’s eyes narrowed as he came to stand over her.\n“What’s wrong with you, Shae? Do you love him or not? If\nyou do, you have to tell him to leave his wife. Otherwise, you\nhave to fire him from the Weather Man’s office, or transfer\nhim out of Janloon. Didn’t I tell you about this a long time\nago, and you wait until now to do something about it?”\nShae opened her mouth; a dozen retorts rose to mind, the\nautomatic responses she’d developed to Hilo over so many\nyears.

Hilo\nwas the Pillar and anything that affected the clan was his\nbusiness, including a potentially ruinous affair between the\nWeather Man and its Sealgiver.\nShae closed her mouth, swallowing all the easy, childish\nthings she wanted to say. Instead, she dropped her face and\npressed her fingertips against her eyes. “Not yet, Hilo, please.\nI’m tired of losing people.”\nHer brother’s jade aura shifted unexpectedly. A subtle\nwithdrawal. He said nothing as she lifted her face out of her\nhands and pointed to the plastic container of pills on the\nnearby table. “Hand me those painkillers and a glass of water.”\nHilo did as she asked. He sat down on the edge of the\ncoffee table and took the empty glass from her when she was\ndone. Shae could see their reflection in the windows. Outside\nit was a moonless night and the Kaul estate was quiet. It was\ndifficult to believe that right now, the clan’s warriors were\nwaging fierce battle in another part of the country. “I was sorry\nto hear about your man, Luto,” Hilo said, in a different voice.\n“Let the gods recognize him.”\n“Let the gods recognize him,” Shae repeated. “He was\nyoung and smart, with the whole rest of his life ahead of him.\nHe wasn’t even a Green Bone; he shouldn’t have died. It was a\nmeaningless death.”\nHilo regarded her with a stern sort of sympathy. “If a bullet\nhad caught you in the neck, would you want me to say your\ndeath was meaningless? Luto wasn’t green, but he gave his life\nfor the clan, just like any Fist or Finger.”\n“Fists and Fingers wear jade and take oaths. They know\nthey might have to do battle.”\n“Everything is a battle now,” Hilo said grimly. “Every\nbusiness, every town, every newspaper article or press\nconference or godsdamned vote in the Royal Council.” The\nfamiliar ferocity in Hilo’s voice was laced with deep\nresignation. “There used to be a way things were done, under\nthe eyes of Old Uncle. We used to be able to count on certain\nthings. Now there aren’t any lines. Everyone in the clan is part\nof the fight.”\nShae wondered if he was thinking of Wen. She was unsure\nof her ability to read him anymore. Over the past two years,\nhe’d rarely spoken to her about anything outside of clan\nbusiness. She remembered how much Hilo used to irritate her\nwith his cheerfully aggressive openness, his physicality, the\nway he would throw his arms around her, goad and tease her.\nLooking at Hilo now, sitting on the table with his elbows on\nhis knees, she found herself wishing for the grinning, arrogant\nbrother she’d once had, the one who always seemed so sure of\nhimself.\n“We’ve been trying for years to break the Mountain and\nsend Ayt Mada to the grave,” Hilo said. “And here we still are\n—that bitch still on top of her clan, still coming after us.

We’ll take some of it, maybe a\nlot, but if that city is the key to her alliance with the barukan\nand control over the black market, she’ll never let Six Hands\nUnity go to another clan.”\nShae thought about what Nau had said to her, his complete\ncertainty. “No, she won’t,” Shae agreed. “But I finally know\nwhat we have to do, to take Ayt’s tools away. I figured it out\nwith Woon in the hospital yesterday.”\nAfter she’d explained their plan, Hilo appeared impressed,\nbut said, “Ayt and her Weather Man will find a way around\nthat, sooner or later.”\n“Yes,” Shae admitted, “but it’ll slow them down badly and\nhamper them enough that they won’t be able to keep up their\nefforts to buy out our Lantern Men.”\n“Juen is still going to have to take as much of Lukang as\npossible and send the barukan who work for the Mountain to\nprison or into graves, as many of them as we can.”\nShae nodded as she placed another cushion under her\ninjured thigh to relieve the throbbing ache. “We may have lost\nthe chance to gain Six Hands Unity as a tributary—but it’s\npossible we can still pull a victory out of this situation.”\nHilo was quiet for a minute. “You’re a good Weather Man,\nShae.” Grudging pride and a touch of bitterness sat in his\nvoice.\nShe leaned her head back against the pillows and closed\nher eyes as exhaustion finally caught up with her. “You’re a\ngood wartime Pillar, Hilo,” she murmured. “And we’re\nfighting a war. Our own slow war.”\nShe was nearly asleep as Hilo adjusted the blanket over\nher. “I told Andy to come over later today and take a look at\nthat leg,” he mentioned. “Who knows if the doctors in Lukang\nare any good?” She felt his lips plant a kiss on her brow, and a\nmoment later, she heard the front door close behind him.\n_______\nShae hobbled into her office on crutches two days later.\nAlthough she noticed more of the clan’s Fists and Fingers on\nthe streets, tense and watchful, everything else in Janloon\nseemed normal. The weather was pleasant and red Autumn\nFestival lamps were everywhere, along with signs promoting\nseasonal retail sales. Hundreds of kilometers away, the\nviolence in Lukang continued but Janlooners were treating the\nnews as a regional issue in the south caused by a nasty internal\nschism in the minor Six Hands Unity clan. By unsaid mutual\nagreement, neither the Mountain nor No Peak were doing\nanything in Janloon to change that impression. The Mountain\nand its tributary forces still controlled most of Lukang, but No\nPeak and the breakaway faction of Six Hands Unity had\nsuccessfully repelled barukan gangs to hang on to the valuable\nport districts.\nThe late Jio Wasu had worried, Lukang is growing, but that\nalso means big-city troubles.

His traitor nephew, Jio Somu, had gone into hiding to\nescape his own relatives who wanted to kill him.\nShae passed Luto’s office and stood outside of it for\nseveral remorseful minutes, leaning on her crutches. Only now\nthat the young man was dead did the office feel like it should\nbe his. She made the slow trek to her own office and told her\nsecretary to begin gathering candidate resumes for a new chief\nof staff.\nAt noon, Shae turned on the television in her office to\nwatch Woon Papi deliver No Peak’s statement to the press\ncalling for a trade embargo on the Uwiwa Islands.\n“Yesterday, the Royal Council introduced strong and\nnecessary legislation to reinforce national security and combat\nrising crime in our cities,” the clan’s Sealgiver announced in\nhis reliably calm and factual manner. The reporters who were\npresent took down his words politely, even though everyone\nwas well aware the No Peak clan was behind the proposed\nembargo in the first place. Kaul Hilo and Woon Papi had gone\nto Wisdom Hall the morning after Shae had returned to\nJanloon and called a meeting of all the most senior No Peak–\naffiliated members of government. A bill had made it to the\nfloor of the national legislature within twenty-four hours.\n“The Uwiwa Islands is the first destination for jade\nsmuggled out of Kekon, and one of the world’s largest\nproducers of illegal SN1,” Woon said on-screen. He provided\nalarming statistics about jade trafficking, drug addiction, sex\ntourism, and street crime, then deftly connected the civil war\nin Six Hands Unity and the outbreak of street violence in\nLukang to corrupting foreign influences. Woon was wearing a\nsteel-gray suit and blue tie. Jade gleamed from his wrist. Shae\nthought he looked handsome on camera, in an understated and\nimperturbable way.\n“The No Peak clan unreservedly backs the proposed trade\nembargo and the Pillar asks every loyal member of the clan\nand every concerned Kekonese citizen to do the same,” the\nSealgiver concluded. “We invite other Green Bone clans to\njoin us in voicing their support, and we will of course lend any\nassistance that is within our ability to help the government\nenact and enforce these measures going forward.”\nWhen Shae had explained the strategy to Hilo, she’d said,\n“With an embargo in place, no goods, no money, and no jade\nwill travel between Kekon and that country. Regardless of\nwhether we win control of Lukang or not, if we block access\nto the Uwiwa Islands, we break the Mountain’s connection to\nthe black market. We do that, and we defund Ayt Mada’s war\nchest.” She was certain the Mountain was transferring funds\nfrom Iyilo’s jade and shine sales through subsidiaries and shell\ncompanies, so the embargo would also outlaw any Kekonese\ncompany from doing business with any Uwiwan ones.\n“The Mountain controls six more seats in the Royal\nCouncil than we do right now,” Hilo had pointed out. She’d\nbeen surprised that he remembered this fact.\n“So we’ll need at least that many independents and\ncouncilmen from minor clans to side with us,” Shae had said.\n“And they will.”\nShe was correct.

Within hours of Woon’s statement on\nbehalf of No Peak, Shae’s people reported that the bill was\nmeeting with favorable press coverage, strong public support,\nand even commitment from some Mountain-affiliated\nlegislators. The country was hungry for policies and bold\nactions that safeguarded Kekon against the Slow War threats\nthat seemed to surround it.\nShae allowed herself a smile as she propped her leg onto a\nchair and massaged the soreness that radiated down into her\ncalf. Not even the Mountain could stop a train running on the\nmomentum of the current zeitgeist. No Peak’s loyalists in the\ngovernment would push the bill into law in short order, along\nwith Hilo’s plan to reform the military. The clan had vastly\nimproved its public standing, and Ayt Mada could hardly\noppose them without appearing hypocritical and angering her\nown supporters.\nShae’s improved mood lasted only until the final hour of\nthe workday, when she received an unexpected visitor. The\nphoto of Kiya that Woon kept on his desk showed a young\nbride with a radiant smile, long hair trailing out from under a\nstylish wide-brimmed red hat. The woman who walked into\nShae’s office and sat down across from her wore a plain black\nturtleneck sweater and a balefully rigid expression that made\napparent the shadows under her eyes and the paleness of her\nstiffly held lips.\n“Kiya,” Shae said, uncomfortably surprised. “What brings\n—”\n“I’m leaving my husband,” Kiya interrupted. “He’s too\nmuch of a noble coward to ask for a divorce, so it’s up to me\nto do it. I want you to know it was my decision. You didn’t\ntake him from me; I gave him up.”\nShae had no answer for an entire minute. “That’s not what\nI wanted,” she said at last. Her voice came out flat, concealing\nwaves of guilty relief and defensive remorse. “Believe me, I\nwould never try to break up your marriage.”\n“Then you are even crueler than I thought,” Kiya replied.\n“I could understand if you were choosing to take something\nfrom someone in a weaker position. I can accept losing to a\nbetter woman. But you’re saying you never even thought of\nwhat you were doing, that it was all done carelessly.”\nKiya’s chin trembled for a second, but she lifted it and\nstared Shae in the face. “Everyone knows my husband spends\nnearly all his time with another woman, and not simply\nbecause he works for her. They all look the other way. When I\nwas a little girl, my father and my brothers would never let\nanyone hurt me. They chased off one of my first boyfriends\nafter he stood me up at the movie theater. Now I’m unhappy\nand humiliated, but they told me not to get on the bad side of\nthe clan by confronting the Weather Man. They tried to talk\nme out of leaving, too, because Woon Papi is so high up in No\nPeak, and it’s good for our family.”\nAngry tears were forming in Kiya’s eyes. “My birthday"

Papi left work early, and we were\nsupposed to spend the evening together. The minute you\nphoned, he left without a word. He didn’t tell me where he\nwas going or when he would be back. He hardly even looked\nat me. Now he comes home to sleep and shower and leave\nagain. He says only that it’s clan business.”\nShae’s face was growing hot. “I’m sorry. It was an\nemergency. I rely on your husband to do important work for\nNo Peak; there’s no one more trustworthy or dependable. I\nneeded him. I still do.”\n“I needed him more,” Kiya shot back. “I’m not a Green\nBone like you, yet I’ve been forced to give four years of my\nlife for the clan, years that I’ll never get back.” She got to her\nfeet and turned to leave.\n“Kiya.” Shae despised the sound of her own voice. “Is\nthere anything you need? Anything I can do for you?”\nWoon’s wife paused and turned back around slowly, as if\nthe question surprised her. “Kaul Shaelinsan, Weather Man of\nNo Peak,” she said, “you can fuck off and die.”\nCHAPTER\n12\nA New Job\nB\nero was arrested and thrown into jail. It was bad luck, of\ncourse; always bad luck. A newly installed security camera\noutside of a sporting goods store in Little Hammer captured an\nimage of him the same week that the Janloon police happened\nto be out in force, maintaining order during a public rally\nprotesting the planned expansion of the Espenian naval base.\nBero was caught with cans of spray paint and a crowbar in his\nbackpack. Tadino was sick with stomach flu, so Bero didn’t\neven have anyone to take the fall with him when he was driven\nto the police station.\nIt was good luck, as well, though. He could’ve been caught\nby patrolling Green Bones instead and then he would likely be\nin a hospital instead of a jail cell. Bero had been through far\nworse situations than a few days in prison. He called in sick to\nhis job at the Double Double casino and waited out the\ninconvenience of detention, speaking in monosyllables and\nshrugging contemptuously at the police sergeant who\nquestioned him. After three days, his cell was unlocked and he\nwas informed that he was being released with a fine for three\nthousand dien and an order to appear in court in two months’\ntime to pay the fee, make formal apologies to the owner of the\nsporting goods store, and face possible further punishment\ndepending on review of the damages caused.\nBero expected that would be the end of it, and was\nunpleasantly surprised when the police sergeant did not escort\nhim out the front of the station, but led him to a back entrance\nwhere two men, one Kekonese and one foreigner, took custody\nof Bero and placed him, still handcuffed, in the back of a silver\nsport utility vehicle with tinted windows. They began driving\naway.\n“Where the fuck are you taking me?” Bero demanded."

They began driving\naway.\n“Where the fuck are you taking me?” Bero demanded.\n“Relax,” said the Kekonese man, who must’ve been\nKekonese by ancestry only, because he spoke with a foreign\naccent. “We just want to talk.”\n“Fuck you, whoever you are,” Bero shouted, kicking the\nback of the driver’s seat. “You’ve got no right to take me\nanywhere, you spenny pricks.”\n“Stop that,” said the man. “If you want to be an asshole,\nwe can drive you back to work, and you can explain to your\nboss what you’ve been up to in your spare time. The Double\nDouble’s a No Peak clan property, isn’t it? And wasn’t the\nClanless Future Movement responsible for an incident there a\nlittle over a year ago?”\nThat shut Bero up. Whoever these foreigners were, they\nknew a lot more about him than the police did. The man put a\ncloth bag over Bero’s head and said, “This is for your own\nprotection. Just sit quietly with your mouth shut.”\nAfter perhaps twenty minutes, the car came to a stop. The\ndoor opened, and Bero was guided, still hooded and\nblindfolded, out of the back seat and into a building. He was\nescorted by the elbow down a hall, through a door, and\nmaneuvered into a chair before the hood was taken off, and\nthen the handcuffs. Bero rubbed his wrists and scowled at the\ntwo men who’d brought him here. The one who’d spoken to\nhim in the car was clean-shaven with a strange-smelling\ncologne, the other one was pale-eyed and had a short haircut.\nThey were in a plain, windowless, unfrightening room with a\ntable and chairs. It appeared to be a small but ordinary meeting\nroom in an office.\n“Here, have something to drink,” said the Kekonese-\nlooking man, putting a bottle of watermelon soda on the table\nand opening another one himself. Despite his vexation, Bero\nwas thirsty, so he snatched the bottle, still glaring.\n“Now that we have some privacy, let’s start with proper\nintroductions.” The man who spoke Kekonese was the one\nwho did all the talking, but Bero suspected that the older\nforeigner, the one standing silent and off to the side with his\narms crossed, was the boss. “My name is Galo, and this is\nBerglund. We work for the Republic of Espenia’s Military\nIntelligence Service.”\n“No shit,” sneered Bero. “I never would’ve guessed.”\n“We have a proposal for you,” said Galo, unruffled by\nBero’s sarcasm. “Once you hear it, I think you’ll see it’s in\nyour interest to accept.” He placed a photograph on the table\nin front of Bero. “Do you recognize this man?”\nThe photograph was of the stocky, curly-haired foreigner\nwho’d first shown up at the Little Persimmon lounge last year,\nthe one who’d caused such a stir with his questions and his\npromise that there were other people ready to help the Clanless"

Afterward, he’d stayed behind to talk\nprivately with Guriho and the others. Molovni, that was his\nname. Bero had seen the man several times since, sitting at the\nback of the meetings, seemingly on good terms with everyone\nnow. Bero only showed up occasionally these days, hoping to\nget close to Ema, who hadn’t yet agreed to go out for a drink\nwith him, but who tolerated him just enough that Bero thought\nit was possible she would give in to him sooner or later.\n“Yeah, so what?” Bero asked, curious despite himself.\nGalo tapped the photo. “Vastik eya Molovni is one of the\nnekolva. It means ‘child of the nation’ in Ygut. Have you\nheard of them?”\n“Nekolva?” Bero looked from Galo to the image of\nMolovni’s face with skepticism. “They have jade abilities\nwithout wearing jade. That’s what people say. I’ve heard\nthey’re not real, that the Ygutanians made them up to scare\npeople.”\n“They’re real,” said Galo, “but also exaggerated. The\nnekolva are the result of an Ygutanian military program that\nbegan after the Many Nations War. Over the past thirty years,\nhundreds of Abukei women have been trafficked to Ygutan or\nlured there with the promise of domestic work. When they\narrive, they’re forced to become surrogates for supposedly\ninfertile couples. Beginning in childhood, the mixedrace\noffspring are dosed with low levels of SN1 and ground jade\npowder. Some of them suffer debilitating side effects or die as\na result. The ones that show promise are given the country’s\nbest military training.”\nBero exclaimed, “The Ygutanian soldiers eat jade?”\nGalo glanced over at Berglund, who nodded for him to\ncontinue. “Ygutan doesn’t have a reliable supply of high-\nquality bioenergetic jade. Lower-grade jade obtained on the\nblack market and industrially ground into powder is more\neffective when ingested. The toll on the body dramatically cuts\ndown their life expectancy, but without visible jade, the\nnekolva make excellent spies and operatives. They require\nregular doses of jade powder and SN1, so they’re easier for\nhandlers to control. They’re Ygutan’s answer to our Navy\nAngels or your country’s Green Bone warriors. And they’re\nhere in Janloon.”\nNo wonder Guriho and Otonyo and the other leaders of the\nClanless Future Movement were eager to make friends with\nthe Ygutanian, if he might be as powerful as a Green Bone.\nBero pushed Molovni’s photograph away. “I don’t know him\nat all. It’s not like we talk.”\n“If one of the nekolva is getting involved in subversive\nactivities in Kekon, then the Ygutanian government is behind\nit. We want to find out what Molovni’s up to. It could be of\nvital consequence to your country and ours.” Galo had been\nstanding, leaning over the table. Now he pulled out a chair and"

Now he pulled out a chair and\nsat down across from Bero, lowering his voice in a serious and\nsolicitously coaxing manner. “We know you take part in anti-\nclan gatherings and activities. We want you to increase your\ninvolvement in the CFM and report everything you observe to\nus: what goes on in the meetings, when Molovni shows up and\nwhat he says, who he talks to and spends time with.”\nBero made an ugly face. “I’m not going to spy for you\nspennies.”\nA flash of irritation broke through Galo’s professional\ndemeanor. He opened his mouth to respond, but Berglund\nspoke up from where he was watching. Galo turned toward\nhim and the two men had a brief conversation in their own\nlanguage. When Galo faced Bero again, his expression was\nrecomposed and he wore a small, coldly confident smile. “I\nshould’ve mentioned earlier that we don’t offer to make\nsomeone an informant for nothing. We identified and selected\nyou, and we pulled strings with the Janloon police to bring you\nhere. Of course, you can decline to work with us. We’ll drive\nyou back to the police station and pretend this conversation\nnever happened. You’ll go back to hiding from Green Bones\nand working your deadend job. Probably best for you to leave\nbefore your employer finds out why you were arrested, but\nthat’ll make it tough to pay the hefty vandalism fine you’ve\nbeen saddled with. Or you can choose to receive a thousand\nEspenian thalirs in cash every month.”\nBero nearly choked on a swallow of watermelon soda.\n“We’ll also take care of that unfortunate fine you owe,”\nGalo said offhandedly, as if throwing a bonus item into a set of\nkitchen knives. “And think about this: Wouldn’t it be helpful\nto have allies who want to keep you safe, who could even get\nyou away from the Green Bone clans, if things start going\nbadly for your friends in the Clanless Future Movement?”\n“They’re not my friends,” Bero grumbled, but not really\narguing. A thousand thalirs a month! How much was that in\ndien? Seven thousand? Eight thousand? A lot.\n“That’s why you’re perfect for the job,” said Galo. “I don’t\ndoubt that you have your own reasons for opposing the clans,\nor else you wouldn’t have joined the CFM to begin with. But I\ncan see you’re no ideologue. I could try to convince you that\nwe’re on the same side, and cooperating with us would be\ndoing a service to your country … but that doesn’t matter to\nyou, does it? You have no real loyalties. You do what you have\nto—you look out for yourself.” Galo said all this with matter-\nof-fact equanimity and did not lose his small smile. “So what\ndo you say?”\nBero finished the soda in the bottle. “I’ll do it,” he said.\nCHAPTER\n13\nNo Secrets\nthe seventh year, sixth month\nO\nne afternoon, Niko came into the house in tears.

        "text": "CHAPTER\n13\nNo Secrets\nthe seventh year, sixth month\nO\nne afternoon, Niko came into the house in tears. He and his\nsiblings had been playing with their cousin Maik Cam and the\nJuen boys at the Horn’s house. Juen Nu and his wife had four\nchildren, including twin boys who were ten months older than\nNiko, and Lina often brought Cam over to play with his\ncousins, so there were always small children running around\nthe courtyard and grounds of the Kaul estate, going from\nhouse to house, leaving their toys and belongings everywhere.\nNiko ran to Wen and complained that the Juen twins had\nbeen making fun of him. While Cam, Ru, and Jaya were\nbuilding with toy blocks, the three older boys had stolen a\npack of cigarettes and a lighter from a drawer and been\nplaying with them. Juen’s wife saw what they were up to and\nconfiscated the items, admonishing them sternly that they\nmight’ve burned the house to the ground. Niko, sobered by\nthis reprimand, blamed his friends for coming up with the\ndisobedient idea in the first place. Fires could kill people, he\nreminded them officiously. His own birth mother had died in a\nhouse fire; that was why he lived with his aunt and uncle.\nThe Juen twins laughed at him. “Who told you that?” they\nasked. His aunt Shae had explained it to him when he was\nlittle. Juen Ritto said, mockingly, “Do you really believe that?\nYou’re the Pillar’s son, how can you be such a baby?” Niko\nballed his fists and demanded angrily to know what they\nmeant, but they ran off.\nWen reassured Niko that his friends were only trying to\ngoad him. That evening, after the children were in bed, she\ntold her husband what had happened.\nHilo was annoyed at the Juen boys for being so tactless,\nbut it wasn’t their fault, nor the fault of their father. They were\nonly kids who overheard what adults said and passed it around\nwithout thinking. Besides, he’d known he would have to face\nthis moment eventually. Niko was eight years old, a mature\nboy for his age, certainly old enough to understand many adult\nconcepts. He was bound to learn the truth sooner or later, and\nit was important that he get the complete story from Hilo\nhimself and not someone else. Nevertheless, it was not a task\nHilo looked forward to.\n“I’ll talk to him,” he promised Wen.\nSeeing his resigned expression, Wen finished the\nphysiotherapy exercises she was doing in the living room and\ncame over to sit next to him on the sofa. She reached for his\nhand, and when he didn’t draw away, she tightened her grip\nand leaned against him. Nine months after that emotional\ncrisis over dinner, they were still unsure around each other,\nand both of them suffered from days when sadness and\nresentment outweighed any chance of affection. As Wen\nregained strength and ability, however, it was getting easier to\nbe relaxed and normal together, to have conversations the way\nthey used to. “No more secrets,” she reminded him.\n“No more secrets,” he agreed. So many problems between\npeople, even those who loved each other, came from a lack of\ncommunication and honesty."

        "text": "they used to. “No more secrets,” she reminded him.\n“No more secrets,” he agreed. So many problems between\npeople, even those who loved each other, came from a lack of\ncommunication and honesty.\nSo on Sixthday morning, Hilo woke his nephew, who he\nthought of as his oldest son, and said that they were going out\nto breakfast together, just the two of them. No one else in the\nfamily was awake yet. The only people they passed on the way\nto the garage were the gardeners bringing in dozens of\ncontainers of red and yellow peonies, symbolizing marital\nhappiness, for Shae and Woon’s wedding next weekend.\nAs soon as the ink was dry on Woon’s divorce, Hilo had\nconfronted Woon, and Wen had talked to Shae, and a date was\nset. Hilo had walked into the hotel room where Shae’s former\nchief of staff was temporarily living, and said, without\npreamble, “Woon-jen, I get upset even thinking about the\nproblems my sister’s poor dating record has caused me over\nthe years. You were Lan’s best friend, and now you’re doing a\ngood job as the clan’s Sealgiver, so you’d better not become\nyet another bad situation. You can either move to the other\nside of the country—we could use more people in Lukang\nright now—or you can marry Shae, but decide soon because\nI’m sick of this drawn-out bullshit. I can’t trust my sister to\ncome to me properly about these things, so if you know your\nown heart at least, this is your chance.”\nWoon’s expression had been extremely apprehensive—one\nwould’ve thought the man expected to be executed—and now\nit transformed into one of cautious joy. “Kaul-jen,” he said\nslowly, “may I have your permission to ask Shae-jen—”\n“Yes, for fuck’s sake, you have my blessing as Pillar.” Hilo\nsighed.\nHe didn’t know how the conversation went between Wen\nand Shae, but he was glad his wife handled that part, as Shae\nmight refuse what she most wanted for no other reason than to\ndeprive him of the position of having been right. When he\nasked Wen about it, she smiled confidently and said, “Don’t\nworry, your sister simply needs to have another woman to talk\nto about this decision, you’ll see.”\nThe marriage of Kaul Shaelinsan, Weather Man of No\nPeak and granddaughter of the Torch of Kekon, ought to have\nbeen an enormous clan pageant held in the Temple of Divine\nReturn and celebrated with a grand banquet in the General Star\nHotel. Instead, it was going to be a relatively modest family\naffair held on the Kaul estate. Both bride and groom had\nagreed to marry quickly and with restraint, out of respect for\nKiya’s family, who were only of moderate status in the clan,\nbut nevertheless deserved not to have their humiliation\npublicized.\nChildren were easier to have difficult conversations with.\nNiko loved fried bread, so Hilo took him to the Hot Hut\nchain’s new location in the Docks, even though he knew Wen\nwould say it wasn’t a healthy breakfast for a child.

Niko threw crumbs into the water\nfor the birds. The morning sun was burning away some of the\npervasive moisture hanging in the air. Food, souvenir, and tour\npackage vendors were setting up to take advantage of the\nguests soon to disembark the commercial cruise ships that had\narrived and moored overnight.\nNone of the vessels had arrived via the Uwiwa Islands; the\ntrade embargo made certain of that.\nThe clan was in a better position than it had been last year.\nThe Mountain had retreated from its efforts to turn No Peak’s\nLantern Men, whose confidence had been renewed by the\nKauls’ successes. The conflict in Lukang was not resolved, but\nthe situation had stabilized enough that Juen had pulled several\nof his senior Fists such as Iyn and Lott back to Janloon,\nleaving enough warriors to support the breakaway faction of\nSix Hands Unity. For the time being, the clans had battled each\nother to another draw—but Hilo was not as enraged by this as\nhe once would’ve been. He’d long hoped to destroy the\nMountain with some swift and fatal blow, even if it cost him\nhis own life, but now he accepted that victory would take\nmuch longer to achieve. He needed to stay alive and outlast his\nenemies.\nTo wash down the fried bread, Hilo bought two cups of hot\nsweetened milk from one of the nearby stands and blew on one\nof them, cooling it down for Niko before giving it to him.\nAlthough he was excited by the special treatment and Hilo’s\nundivided attention, the boy knew there must be some reason\nfor it, and he was even quieter than usual, eating with\nconcentration and glancing at his uncle frequently.\n“Are you looking forward to Boat Day?” Hilo asked.\n“I guess so,” Niko said. He was a strange child, in Hilo’s\nopinion—not easily upset, but rarely eager or expressive,\neither. Watchful and intelligent, ahead of his class in school,\nbut with too much of Lan’s melancholy, Hilo thought.\n“On Boat Day, we’ll come back here and watch the ship\nsinking. We’ll get the sweet roasted nuts you like, and\nwatermelon soda, and you can stay up as late as you want.”\nNiko brightened at this. “Can Uncle Anden come too?”\n“Of course, if he’s not busy.” Without changing his easy\nand affectionate tone, Hilo said, “Niko-se, I heard the Juen\nboys were saying some things the other day that made you\nupset. Do you want to tell me about what happened?”\nNiko’s smile faded and he scuffed the ground beneath the\nbench with the tips of his shoes. Hilo continued speaking\ngently. “You might hear other kids talk about our family. They\nmight even say things that seem mean or untrue. That’s only to\nbe expected because of our position in the clan. When you\nhear anything that you’re not sure of, you shouldn’t assume\nthings or react right away. Just come to me or your ma.

Your\naunt Shae and your uncle Anden might try to protect your\nfeelings, only because they love you, and your uncle Tar, he\nlikes to tell big stories, sometimes too big. But I’ll always tell\nyou the truth.”\nNiko blurted, “They thought I was stupid for saying my ma\n—not Ma, but the first mother I used to have—died in a fire.”\n“You’re not stupid,” Hilo reassured him. “It’s only that\npeople are always quick to talk about someone else’s tragedy\nbehind their back. We didn’t tell you much about what\nhappened to your mother because you were too little to\nunderstand and it might’ve frightened or upset you. But you’re\nold enough now and should hear it.”\nHilo took a moment to finish his piece of fried bread and\ngather his thoughts. “Your da, my older brother, he was a good\nperson, a powerful Green Bone, but too softhearted\nsometimes. I didn’t use to understand it, but now that I’m\nolder, I think I understand it more. After he became Pillar, his\nwife left him for another man, a foreigner, and they ran away\ntogether to another country far away.”\nNiko gazed at him expectantly with the same frowning\nlook of concentration Hilo had seen on the boy’s face when he\nwas drawing or building or engrossed in a book, but Hilo\ncould Perceive the boy’s little heart thumping. Hilo patted his\npockets, but let his hands drop. He tried not to smoke too\nmuch in front of the kids.\n“Normally when someone betrays the Pillar and the clan,\nthey have to be punished, they have to be killed, no matter\nwho they are, even if they used to be a friend or someone you\nloved,” Hilo explained. “Your aunt Shae had to kill the old\nWeather Man because he went against your father. And\nremember your uncle Tar told you the story about the time\nwhen we had to kill a man named Fuyin who used to be one of\nour own Fists, because he turned to the Mountain clan. I didn’t\nwant to execute him, but if I didn’t, then I’d be failing my duty\nas the Pillar, and it would mean anyone could betray us.”\n“My da had to kill my own ma?” Niko asked, horrified.\n“No, Niko, your da was softhearted like I said, and he let\nthem go. Even though it was the wrong decision to make as a\nPillar, it turned out to be a lucky thing, because she was\npregnant with you at the time, and so you were born in\nStepenland. You already know about the clan war with the\nMountain and how your da was killed when you were a baby.\nHe didn’t know you’d been born. We didn’t find out until\nalmost two years later.”\nHilo watched his nephew carefully as he went on. “When I\nfound out about you, I went to Stepenland with your uncle Tar\nto talk to Eyni. For your sake, I forgave her for her betrayal\nand told her she could return to Janloon and live here with the\nfamily so you wouldn’t have to grow up in a foreign place, far"

She and her\nboyfriend agreed at first, but they lied and tried to steal you\naway again. They couldn’t be reasoned with. It was bad\nenough that they had shamed your father, but now they wanted\nto keep you away from your country and your family. So you\nsee that I couldn’t let that happen.”\nNiko’s lips trembled and his eyes welled with tears. “Was\nshe really so bad that you had to kill her?” he asked\nplaintively, angry and ashamed that his own mother was\namong the lowest of people, a clan traitor.\n“Niko-se, first of all, I did it very quick, so she didn’t have\nany time to be scared and it didn’t hurt at all. And it’s not\nalways that people are bad in their hearts so much as bad in\ntheir decisions. A good person can go through something in\ntheir life, or be around the wrong sorts of people, and have\ntheir mind twisted. Unfortunately, Eyni was one of those\npeople, and if she’d taken you away, you would’ve never\nknown me or your ma, or your uncles or aunts, or your brother\nor sister or cousins. You would never even know who your\nreal father was. You’d never go to the Academy or become a\nGreen Bone. Would you have wanted that?”\nNiko shook his head with wretched vehemence. Hilo put\nhis arms around the boy and pulled him into a tight hug. Niko\nwas too big for Hilo to hold on his lap the way he used to, and\nhe wondered at and regretted how quickly his children were\ngrowing, how rapidly time seemed to be passing.\nNiko rubbed his teary face against the shoulder of Hilo’s\nshirt. “Am I going to be a bad person too, if my mother was a\ntraitor who had to be killed?”\n“Don’t ever think that,” Hilo said sharply, drawing back\nand looking the boy seriously in the face. “No one is destined\nto become like their parents. In fact, we can learn from their\nmistakes and be less likely to repeat them. Your real ma is the\none who raised you. She, and your uncle Tar, and your uncle\nKehn—who was killed when you were young so you might\nnot remember him as much—their own father was executed\nand their family was disgraced. They turned that around, and\nnow the name Maik is at the top of the clan and spoken in the\nsame breath as ours. You’re your own person, Niko. You have\nmany people who love you and are proud of you. And\neveryone says you take after your father, you look just like\nhim. So never think that the bad way your mother died has\nanything to do with you. Understand?”\nNiko sniffed and nodded, and Hilo drew him back into an\nembrace and kissed the top of his head. “Now you see why we\ndidn’t tell you this when you were younger,” he said. “You\nwouldn’t have understood, and you might’ve been scared or\nconfused.” There was probably still some fear and confusion,"

But sometimes, it’s much\nharder, when it’s someone you knew and maybe trusted. I feel\na lot worse in those cases, but I still have to do it.”\nThey sat together in silence for several minutes, Hilo\nstroking his nephew’s hair and letting Niko lean against him as\nthe boy absorbed everything his uncle had said. Hilo was\nrelieved that it was done. He could only hope he’d done an\nadequate job of explaining such a painful topic to a child.\nBeing a Kaul, a Green Bone, and the Pillar of the clan defined\nHilo at all times, but even more important, he felt now, was\nbeing an honest and loving father to his children. Niko was the\nfirst son of the family. If he was to be Pillar someday, he\nneeded to be raised well, supported but never coddled. “I love\nyou, Niko, never forget that.”\n“I love you too, Uncle,” Niko said, drying his eyes.\nHilo kissed Niko on the forehead and set him down. As\nthey walked back to the car, he added, with a wink, “Don’t tell\nRu and Jaya that we went to Hot Hut, it’ll make them whine\nwith jealousy.”\nCHAPTER\n14\nGreen Turning Black\nthe seventh year, eighth month\nH\nilo was awoken by an unexpected phone call in the middle\nof the night.

Tar was no\nlonger at the phone booth. They followed a trail of blood on\nthe sidewalk. The Pillarman had run for three blocks and\ncollapsed behind a building.

He had knife wounds on his torso and arms.\nWhen he saw Hilo, his face collapsed into a baffling\nexpression of relief, pleading, and fear. “Hilo-jen, help me,” he\nbegged, nearly choking. “I’ve done something awful.”\nHilo could not believe his eyes. The sight of his most loyal\nand fearsome lieutenant lying crying and shivering, covered in\nblood in an alleyway, was not something that seemed as if it\ncould be real. Juen and Lott knelt over Tar and Channeled into\nhim enough to control the bleeding before lifting him into the\nback seat of one of the two cars. “Take him back to the house,”\nHilo instructed Lott and Ton. “Call Anden to come over and\nhelp patch him up. Don’t let him leave, don’t let him make any\nphone calls, don’t let anyone else see him—not my wife, not\nmy kids.”\nHilo went with Juen and Vin back to the apartment\nbuilding. Tar’s unit was on the top floor, a spacious penthouse\nfacing south over the city. The door was unlocked. Hilo\nwalked inside to a terrible sight. The place was wrecked.\nBlood soaked into the beige carpet had gone tacky and the\nsplatters on the wall were darkening to brown. Furniture and\ndoors were splintered and broken, items scattered. Iyn Ro’s\nbody was sprawled partly across the sofa in the living room,\nthe fatal wound in her throat a gaping red meaty opening that\nwas difficult for even a seasoned knife fighter like Hilo to look\nat.\n“Fuck the gods in Heaven,” Juen whispered in horror.\nThe warmth was draining from Hilo’s limbs. It was one\nthing to see a Green Bone slain by an enemy or killed in a fair\nduel. It was another entirely to look upon a scene of carnage\ninside a relative’s home. His mind struggled against denial, not\nwanting to accept what his own eyes told him. Maik Tar, his\nPillarman and brother-in-law, whom he’d loved and trusted\nsince they were teens at the Academy, had murdered a fellow\nGreen Bone of the clan, a woman he’d planned to marry next\nmonth. Iyn’s jade earrings and bracelets were still on her body.\nThe sight was obscene, as if she were an animal slaughtered\nfor no reason at all, meat left to rot in the sun.\nHilo stayed long enough to ensure that arrangements were\nmade for the body, then he left Juen and Vin with the tasks of\nseeing that they were carried out and informing Iyn’s family.\nHe drove back to the Kaul house alone in a numbed state, the\nstreetlights passing over the white hood of the Duchesse with\nthe monotonous pulse of a heartbeat in his ears.\nIyn Ro was not some victim of little account. She’d been a\nsenior Fist of No Peak, one of the few women to ever reach\nsuch a high rank. She was known by everyone and looked up\nto by other women on the greener side of the clan. Hilo had\ntaken notice of Iyn long ago when he’d been Horn, for being\nespecially hardworking, and she’d been Juen’s leading\ncandidate to become First Fist when Vuay retired.

Few men\ncould match her intensity, or would want to, which was why\nshe kept coming back to Maik Tar. And she had not died easily\n—the destroyed apartment and Tar’s multiple wounds made\nthat apparent.\nIt was the worst crime within No Peak that Hilo could\nremember. It would send shock waves through the clan. Iyn’s\nrelatives would demand justice.\nWhen he arrived at the house, Anden and Lott were\nwaiting on the front steps. They were standing together but not\ntalking, both of them grave. Seeing them side by side, Hilo\nremembered that the two men were of the same age. They’d\nbeen classmates in the Academy, friends even, but they had\nturned out so differently.\nLott said, “We put him in the study, Hilo-jen. He hasn’t\ntried to leave.”\nUnder the orange glow of the house’s front lights, Anden’s\nface was pale. He was wearing his physician’s jade and his\naura was thin and weary; he’d been expending his energy. “His\ninjuries won’t kill him,” he said in answer to Hilo’s silent\nquestion. “One of them punctured his spleen, but I shut down\nthe bleeding and got some fluids into him. I wasn’t sure\nwhether to do much more, since …” He trailed off\nunnecessarily. Hilo put a hand on his cousin’s shoulder in\nthanks, then went into the house.\nLott had posted a total of three Fists around Tar—two in\nthe room with him and one outside the door. It was a wise\nprecaution; even injured, Maik Tar was one of the clan’s best\nfighters and if he was out of his mind, there was no telling\nwhat he was capable of. When Hilo came into the room,\nhowever, he found his brother-in-law sitting quietly on the\nsofa, elbows on knees, his hands laced over the back of his\nlowered head, as if he were folding himself into the brace\nposition for an airplane crash. His wounds had been bandaged\nand he was in fresh clothes brought down from Hilo’s own\ncloset.\nHilo motioned for the guards to leave the room and close\nthe door behind them. Tar raised his head and looked up with\nthe most wretched and pitiful expression Hilo had ever seen.\n“She’s dead, isn’t she?” When Hilo nodded, Tar began to sob\n—long, hard, soulwracking sounds that Hilo had only heard\nfrom him once before, when he’d learned that Kehn had been\nkilled.\nHe went to the man he thought of as a brother and sat\ndown beside him, putting an arm around his shoulder and\ngiving him some comfort as he wept. “I don’t know what\nhappened,” Tar managed to choke out. “It started like any\nother fight, but it got so much worse. She was going to leave\nme, Hilo-jen. She said hurtful things …” Tar’s jade aura was\nlike broken glass, all shattered edges. More words pushed\nthemselves out in the spaces between sobs. “I didn’t mean to\nhurt her, I swear to the gods. I love her. I was going to fucking"

I was going to fucking\nmarry her. Sure, we can both get emotional sometimes. We\nfought too much in the past, but we were done with all that, we\nwere finally going to make it work. But tonight after we got\nhome, she said she was calling off the wedding and leaving me\nfor good. She was sleeping with someone else, I know she\nwas, she said as much. She was drunk, and I’d had a few\ndrinks too … I don’t know how we ended up drawing talon\nknives, I don’t remember that part at all.”\nHilo let Tar talk and cry himself out. None of what he said\nreally mattered. There was no excuse for what he’d done, no\nexplanation that could change the fact that a Fist of the clan\nwas dead by his hand. But if Tar needed to say these things, to\nget them out, then the least Hilo could do was listen. When at\nlast Tar fell silent, Hilo pulled out a packet of cigarettes. He\noffered his Pillarman a smoke and lit it for him, then lit one for\nhimself; he needed to calm his nerves. He was not sure he\ncould face what had to come next.\nHe saw now that he was responsible for the night’s\ntragedy. He’d sent his Pillarman to do the clan’s darkest work,\nhad given him all the jobs that were the most difficult, the\nmost sensitive, the most brutal and violent. During the clan\nwar, he’d remade the Pillarman’s role to take advantage of\nMaik Tar’s nature: completely loyal, ferocious, dependable,\nand discreet. A man doing that kind of work needed an anchor,\na counterpoint, some other force to maintain him as a human\nbeing and not simply a pointed instrument. Kehn had been that\nanchor, but Kehn had been gone for years, and Hilo and Wen\nhad been sunk into their own rift, not paying close enough\nattention. Clinging to someone as fiery as Iyn Ro had been a\nmistake; she was bound to move on from him and Tar could\nnot handle more abandonment.\nWen knew, Hilo thought miserably. But he had been\noptimistic. He’d cut back on Tar’s duties believing it would be\nenough to curb his instincts. He’d blessed the marriage with\nthe certainty that determined love would make Tar better and\nhappier. So in the end it was all his fault, Hilo felt, for turning\nTar into a monster.\n“Tar,” Hilo said gently. “You weren’t yourself. You lost\nyour mind tonight and you did something terrible that I know\nyou would never have done if you’d been thinking at all\nclearly.” Hilo wondered now, too late for it to be of any use, if\nperhaps there was a medical reason as well, if a sudden\nundetected onset of the Itches was to blame. Tar would be the\nsort to dismiss or ignore jade overexposure symptoms,\nconvincing himself that they were some other temporary\nmalady, something that did not threaten his sense of greenness.\n“What you’ve done can’t be undone.

You murdered one of our\nown, a Fist, a fellow Green Bone. It’s a crime that can’t be\nforgiven, you know that.” It was hard for Hilo to even say the\nwords, and it was harder for Tar to hear them. His hands began\nto tremble and he pressed them into stillness between his\nknees, his shoulders hunched. He looked as if he might be\nsick. Hilo could barely believe that this wretched man had\nbeen for so long one of the clan’s most feared warriors.\n“We need to go for a walk, Tar,” Hilo said. The words\ncame out of him against his will. “Do you think you can do it,\nor do you need some help?”\nTar looked up at the Pillar with misery but also\nunderstanding and resignation. He said, with some of his usual\ndependable courage, “I can walk.”\n“Can I trust you with your jade?” He had not given the\norder for Tar to be jade-stripped and did not want to humiliate\nhim further in this moment if he could possibly avoid it.\n“I won’t be any trouble, Hilo-jen.”\nHilo put a hand on his Pillarman’s back and guided him\nout of the room and toward the door of the house. The Fists in\nthe hallway stepped aside and gave them ample space to pass.\nTar said, “Can I see the kids? Just for a minute.”\nHilo said, “I don’t think that’s a good idea. They’re\nasleep.”\nTar nodded, and they walked out of the house and onto the\ngrounds together. Lott and Anden watched them go with grim\nfaces, not knowing what to say and saying nothing.\nThe Kaul estate sprawled over five acres, with the\ncompound of residences and main courtyard in the center. The\ngardens, pond, lawn, training hall, and small swath of\nwoodland covered the remaining areas and separated the\nfamily’s residences from its neighbors and the surrounding\ncity. Hilo guided Tar onto one of the walking paths that wound\nthrough the property. They walked around the back of the\nHorn’s house, down a small slope where the Juen children\nwere always making forts and holding mock battles. Hilo\nwalked alongside his Pillarman, who could not move quickly\non account of his injuries. When he swayed or stumbled a\nlittle, Hilo put a hand under his elbow to steady him. It was\nthree or four o’clock in the morning, as quiet as it ever got in\nJanloon. A holding place between the day that had gone and\nthe one to come.\nWhen they were well away from the houses, and\ncompletely alone so that Hilo could only distantly Perceive the\nauras of the other Green Bones on the property, he stopped and\nfaced his Pillarman. Tar took a step back and lowered himself\nto his knees. “Hilo-jen,” he said coarsely. “I’m sorry I let you\ndown. Ever since we were kids in the Academy, I only ever\nwanted to follow you and be your best warrior. We’ve been\nthrough a lot together.” His voice broke, and he took a second\nto recompose himself so that when he spoke again, his words"

We’ve been\nthrough a lot together.” His voice broke, and he took a second\nto recompose himself so that when he spoke again, his words\nwere steady. “The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its\nmaster.” He touched his forehead to the ground and\nstraightened up again with calm, apologetic expectancy—the\nopposite of whatever awful madness had brought him to this\nplace tonight.\nHilo said, “Close your eyes.” Tar obeyed. Hilo drew his\ntalon knife and walked behind him. Tar’s jade aura throbbed\nwith grief and fear, his heartbeat thundering in the center of\nHilo’s Perception, but he did not move at all, not even when\nHilo placed a hand on the top of his head. It had to be done:\none swift stroke, left to right, across the throat. Hilo had killed\nmen with the knife before; it would be an easy motion, over in\nless time than it took to gasp.\nA second passed. Another. Then another. Hilo began to\nshake. He was clutching the talon knife so tightly he could feel\nthe hilt starting to strain under his involuntary Strength. His\nother hand curled in Tar’s hair, gripping the back of his\nbrother-in-law’s skull. The woods seemed to close in and blot\nout the edges of his vision.\nHilo’s fingers spasmed open and the talon knife slipped\nfrom his grasp and fell into the gravel at his side. He spun\naway from Tar like a puppet jerked on strings. “Godsdamnit,”\nhe whispered. “Fuck. Fuck.” He leaned a hand heavily on the\nnearest tree, head bowed, and put his other hand over his eyes.\n“I’ll do it, Hilo-jen,” Tar said from behind him. He picked\nup Hilo’s fallen talon knife and got unsteadily to his feet,\nbrushing at the dirt on his knees. “Walk away and I’ll handle\nit.” This simple statement, delivered so easily, so matter-of-\nfactly, snapped the last of Hilo’s resolve. It was exactly what\nTar had been doing for him for years—handling things. The\nworst, most vicious sorts of things, quietly, reliably, efficiently,\nand without complaint—so that Hilo could walk away.\nHilo turned around. “Give me back the knife, Tar.” His\nPillarman handed it to him and Hilo stowed it in its sheath. He\npressed the heels of his palms to his eyes, his mind churning.\n“Here’s what will happen.” He lowered his hands and said,\n“You’ll be stripped of your jade and exiled from Kekon. You\ncan’t come back, ever. If you try, your life will be forfeit and\nanyone can take it with my approval. The clan will want your\nblood, and I’ll have to convince everyone that the Itches are to\nblame and you should be allowed to keep your life, so long as\nyou never wear green again. I’m sending you away, Tar, to\nsomewhere you’ll have to start over, without jade and without\nclan.”\nTar shook his head, his expression deeply confused, as if\nhe wasn’t sure whether to thank or blame Hilo for sparing him.\n“I’m nothing without jade and clan, Hilo-jen,” he exclaimed."

It would\nbe easier on everyone, and it’s the right thing to do.”\n“Maybe,” Hilo said quietly, “but I can’t lose another\nbrother. I’ve lost too many already.” He put his hands on Tar’s\nshoulders, and pulled him close. He dropped his forehead\nagainst Tar’s. “I could always count on you. That’s why I’ve\nalways asked for too much. I’m asking you for one more thing\nnow, the last thing I need from you. I’m asking you to live.”\n_______\nWhen Hilo came back into the house two hours later, he found\nWen sitting on the floor in a corner of their bedroom, knees\npulled up to her chest, the side of her head leaning against the\nwall. Her eyes were red and swollen. She barely raised them as\nhe entered.\n“Is it done?” she asked in a dull voice. “Is my brother\ndead?”\nHilo hung his jacket on the bedpost and sat down heavily\non one corner of the mattress. “No,” he said. “Stripped and\nexiled. He’ll be gone by the time the sun comes up.” He let out\na breath full of emotional exhaustion, and pulled a handful of\njade pieces—rings, studs, bell, watch—from his pocket and\nplaced them on the bedside table. Tar’s jade. Hilo had\npromised him it would go to Maik Cam someday. “There will\nbe a lot of people in the clan who’ll say he should’ve paid with\nhis life. And they’ll be right to be angry. Iyn and her family\ndeserve better. So I’ll have to deal with that. But I couldn’t do\nit. I couldn’t kill my brother. What kind of a person could do\nthat?”\nWen was staring at him, her mouth slightly open as if she\nmeant to speak but had lost the words. Hilo unbuttoned his\nshirt. The sky was beginning to lighten over the house and he\ndesperately needed a couple hours of sleep before the certain\nstorm of the day to come. “I’m going to make some changes,”\nhe said slowly. “Tar’s people, his Nails, they’ll go back under\nJuen. The whole greener side of the clan should answer to the\nHorn again. The Pillarman used to be something different\nunder Grandda and Lan. Because of the clan war and who Tar\nis, I changed it. Whatever I sent him to do, he said yes. We\nneeded that. But I don’t want it to be that way anymore.”\nHe glanced over as he took off his watch and talon knife\nand dropped them on the dresser. “The Pillarman used to be a\nperson who didn’t answer to the half of the clan with jade or\nthe half with money,” he said. “Someone who was always at\nthe Pillar’s side, someone who gave him advice he needed to\nhear, who made everything run smoother. Who helped the\nPillar to be the Pillar.”\nHilo got up and went over to Wen. He held out a hand and"

He held out a hand and\nraised her to her feet. “You’re that person,” he said quietly. “I\ncouldn’t be Pillar without you, and I still can’t. We’ve both\nhurt each other because we were too stubborn about what we\nexpected, and we paid badly for that. But what’s the point of\nlife if we give up on the people we love?” He enfolded her into\nhis arms and stroked her smooth hair. He kissed her on the\nforehead and cheeks and mouth. “Wen, will you be my\nPillarman?”\nWen cupped her trembling hand against his jaw. “The clan\nis my blood,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion, but\nperfectly steady. She bowed her head and pressed her mouth to\nthe hollow of his throat. “And the Pillar is its master.”\nFIRST INTERLUDE\nThe Long Judgment\nT\nhe last king of Kekon, Eon II, presided over the darkest\nperiod of his nation’s history and died as an ignominious\nfailure. Kekon had been relatively peaceful and prosperous for\nthree hundred years following the unification of the nation\nunder the royal family of Jan, but by the time Eon II ascended\nto the throne at the age of nineteen, the country was facing\npolitical upheaval. Foreign entities had established a presence\non Kekon. The merchant Bramsko Explorers Guild from\nStepenland, the Tun Empire, which controlled the port city of\nToshon in Kekon’s southern peninsula, and the Shotarian navy\nthat ruled the East Amaric Ocean were increasingly in conflict\nwith each other and with the local population.\nIn the wake of several violent incidents and allegations of\nforeign bribes paid to the royal family, the country’s numerous\nGreen Bone clan families began to take sides against one\nanother, with some remaining loyal to the beleaguered\nmonarchy and others supporting its overthrow. When the\nEmpire of Shotar invaded Kekon with the full might of its\nmodern military, it faced a defending force of jade warriors\nwho possessed exceptional abilities but no comparable\norganization or unity.\nDespite this, the fighting was so fierce and casualties so\nhigh that documents later revealed Shotarian military\ncommanders were prepared to burn the city of Janloon to the\nground, arguing that otherwise every last Green Bone on the\nisland would die fighting, each taking hundreds of enemy\nsoldiers down with him. King Eon II was advised by his\ncounselors to flee the country and continue the war in exile.\nInstead, the monarch commanded the clans to retreat. He\nsurrendered to Shotar and abdicated the throne. The Shotarian\ngovernment kept the former king in comfortable captivity,\nmaking his eventual death by poison at the hands of foreign\noverseers appear to be from natural causes.\nThe Kekonese so widely reviled King Eon II as a coward\nand a weakling that when the monarchy was symbolically if\nnot functionally reestablished fifty years later, Eon’s\ngrandnephew Ioan III reigned under the title of prince to\ndistance himself from his hated relative.

        "text": "grandnephew Ioan III reigned under the title of prince to\ndistance himself from his hated relative. More recent historical\nscholarship has been kinder to Eon II. His seemingly\npremature capitulation is estimated to have saved millions of\nlives and enabled the country’s remaining Green Bone\nwarriors to regroup and form the One Mountain Society—the\nindomitable national resistance network that would end\nShotarian rule and be the precursor to today’s modern clans.\nDuring his captivity, the former monarch urged peace and\ncitizen cooperation with the foreign governors, but was later\ndiscovered to have sold off most of the royal family’s\npossessions and secretly funneled the money to Green Bone\nguerillas via Lantern Men intermediaries. A Shotarian\nbodyguard who wrote a memoir about Eon II described him as\nprivate, bookish, and especially softhearted toward animals—\nthe antithesis of the fierce and brutish Kekonese stereotype\nwidely depicted by Shotarian propaganda.\nOn his deathbed, the disgraced king is said to have\nlamented, “I’ll be remembered not for who I was, but for what\nI wasn’t. Perhaps it’s for the best. Let the gods judge me for\nwhat I did not do.”\nCHAPTER\n15\nSkeptics\nthe thirteenth year, sixth month\nA\ns the most junior physician on staff in the Paw-Paw district\nmedical clinic, Anden was stuck with the least desirable\nworking hours—late nights, early mornings, holidays. Out of\nthe eighteen doctors, only three were Green Bones. Anden\noften worked even longer than his assigned shifts, or was\ncalled in outside of them. His reputation as a jade prodigy and\nhis status as a member of the Kaul family meant that Fists and\nFingers of the clan sought him out specifically, so he was\nalways in demand. Also, Paw-Paw was a poor and violent\nneighborhood; there were often urgent cases to deal with. One\nevening, he was summoned to treat a patient with a collapsed\nlung and internal bleeding. He was surprised to see that the\nman on the bed was Lott Jin, his former classmate from Kaul\nDu Academy, now the No Peak clan’s First Fist of Janloon.\n“Lott-jen,” Anden exclaimed, “how did this happen to\nyou?” Lott’s injuries were the result of blunt trauma.\nRemarkably, none of his bones were broken and the multiple\nknife wounds were shallow—clearly, Lott’s Steel was\nexcellent, but blood vessels and soft organs were difficult to\nprotect even with good jade abilities.\n“Barukan,” Lott answered grimly, as if that was the only\nexplanation required. Later, the two Fingers anxiously waiting\nin the reception area to hear of their captain’s condition would\nexplain that Lott had been ambushed by men with pipes,\ncrowbars, and cleavers during a stakeout of a barukan gang\nhideout. The First Fist had killed four attackers before falling\noff a third-story fire escape. Some barukan gang members\npossessed enough self-taught jade ability to make them\ndangerous even against Green Bones, especially when they\nhad an advantage of numbers. Most of them were originally\nfrom the Matyos gang in Shotar and claimed vague allegiance\nto the Mountain clan, which denounced and punished their\nillegal activities but also used them to do low-level work and"

Most of them were originally\nfrom the Matyos gang in Shotar and claimed vague allegiance\nto the Mountain clan, which denounced and punished their\nillegal activities but also used them to do low-level work and\nto attack No Peak without getting directly involved\nthemselves. Keeping the criminal class under heel while\nmanipulating it against their rivals was a long-standing\ntradition of the clans.\nSurgery would normally be called for to stop Lott’s\nbleeding, but Anden was able to find the injury and seal the\nblood vessels with a few focused pulses of Channeling. He\ncouldn’t help but feel strange treating the classmate he used to\nhave feelings for as a teenager, and he couldn’t stop himself\nfrom noticing that even pale and injured—wavy hair damp\nwith exertion, long-lashed eyes closed, sulky lips pressed\ntogether in pain—Lott was still attractive. He was also now\none of the clan’s top Green Bones.\n“You’re going to need to stay overnight, on an oxygen\nmachine,” Anden told him, Channeling slowly and diffusely to\nraise the man’s circulation and speed healing. “You’re sure to\nrecover fully, Lott-jen, but it’s going to take a few weeks.”\nLott nodded, eyes still closed. Anden got up to wash his\nhands at the sink. “It could’ve been you, Emery.” Lott spoke\nfrom behind him. “You were the best of our class at the\nAcademy. I would’ve expected you to become First Fist, not\nme.”\nAnden turned around. Lott had opened his eyes and was\nlooking at Anden with the corners of his full mouth raised in a\nsarcastic smile. He gestured at his own situation, his bandaged\nbody. “Are you sure you made the right choice? No regrets?”\nAnden frowned as he dried his hands. “Who knows what\nrank I would’ve reached. Maybe I’d already be dead, by the\nMountain or by the Itches. Fate makes assignments in the clan\nas much as merit does. Probably more.” That was true for Lott\nas well. Iyn Ro had been the one pegged for promotion to First\nFist, until she’d been murdered by Tar. Thinking about that\nnight made Anden shudder.\nHe could feel Lott’s eyes on him, the slow swirling of the\nman’s jade aura. Anden said, “I don’t think anyone can ever\nknow if they made the right choices, but I don’t regret mine,\nso long as I’m still alive to be useful in other ways.” He sat\ndown in the chair next to Lott’s bed, trying not to pay any\nattention to the man’s dark eyes or the shadow of stubble on\nhis jaw. “What about you, Lott-jen?” he asked. “When we\nwere in the Academy, you never wanted to take oaths to the\nclan as a jade warrior. Why did you?”\nLott’s expression hardened and his aura drew in. Anden\nassumed he wouldn’t answer, but then he said, “Everyone said\nmy da was a top Fist, as green as they come. When I was\nyoung, I didn’t want to have anything in common with that\nbastard—let the gods recognize him.” Lott tried to take too\ndeep of a breath and folded forward in discomfort. He leaned"

He leaned\nback against the raised head of the bed. “But after he died, it\nwas the clan that was there, that took care of my ma and my\nsiblings. Now, my sister’s graduated from college. My ma\nstarted a catering business. They never would’ve dreamed of\ndoing that before. Why shouldn’t I rise to the highest rank I\ncan? It’s the best thing I can do for them.” His eyes flashed\ndefiantly, as if he expected Anden to argue with him. When he\ndidn’t, Lott’s voice lost its defensive edge. “The Pillar was the\nfirst person in the clan who spoke to me like a man,” he\nadmitted. “He expected me to be my own person, not just a\npoor copy of my da. He made me think it might be possible to\nbe green without being cruel and angry.”\nAnden said quietly, “I never thought of you as a copy of\nanyone. It seemed to me you were always your own person.”\nImpulsively, he reached a hand out toward Lott’s, but the other\nman pulled his arm away, not sharply or quickly, but obviously\nenough. Anden withdrew his reach, stung, his face hot with\nembarrassment.\n“I’m glad to see you’re happy with your decisions,” Lott\nsaid, not unkindly, but looking away to pretend he didn’t see\nAnden’s discomfort. “Thanks for patching me up, keke. Now\nthat I’m the First Fist, life’s more dangerous and I have further\nto fall if I’m unlucky. I can’t afford to be careless or to make\nany mistakes.”\n_______\nA voice message in Espenian was waiting for Anden on the\nanswering machine when he returned to the small office he\nshared with two other doctors, both of them gone for the day.\nAnden checked the clock and did a quick time zone\ncalculation. It would be morning in Adamont Capita. To avoid\nexpensive long-distance charges showing up on the clinic’s\nphone bill, he used a calling card to reach Dr. Martgen, who\nanswered on the second ring. “Thank the Seer I reached you,”\nsaid the Espenian doctor. “We’ve run up against a wall, I’m\nafraid.”\nFor the past six years, Dr. Martgen and a small number of\npassionate advocates in the Republic of Espenia, with discreet\nbut considerable support from the No Peak clan, had been\nadvocating for the legalization of bioenergetic jade in medical\ntreatments based on Kekonese healing. A bill was now being\ndebated in the National Assembly, but was being blocked by\nthe Espenian Physicians Society. Martgen explained, “Not\nonly is the EPS intent on killing the bill, they’re proposing\nstiffer criminal penalties on anyone who, in their words, uses\nbioenergetic jade to perform ‘unproven and potentially\nharmful medical procedures.’”\nAnden pressed his knuckles into his desk.

The legalization of jade in\nEspenia, even if it were limited to the medical field, was\nsomething No Peak had been wanting for years. “I’ll get on a\nflight as soon as I can,” he said. “I need to sort out some things\nat work and with my family, and I’ll try to bring others with\nme. I’ll call you back.”\nAfter hanging up, Anden let out a long breath and\nscrubbed his hands over his face. Then he got on the phone\nagain. He called in favors from his coworkers, pleading with\nthem to cover his shifts for the next three weeks, then left a\nmessage for the clinic’s secretary to reschedule his less urgent\nappointments. That done, he called the Kaul house. Hilo was\nnot home, but Anden explained the situation to Wen, who told\nhim to arrange the trip to Espenia and act with the clan’s full\nauthority. It still startled Anden sometimes, to hear his sister-\nin-law say things such as, “I’ll pass everything you said on to\nthe Pillar,” speaking of Hilo the way a Pillarman would, as if\nshe didn’t share a bed with him every night.\nHaving secured the clan’s approval, Anden phoned Dr.\nTimo and Dr. Yon, two senior physicians who’d traveled with\nAnden to Espenia on professional visits to the Demphey\nMedical Research Center. Ordinarily, he would never think to\nbe so presumptuous as to contact them personally at such an\ninconvenient time and ask them to upend their schedules.\nWhen he reached each of them, he apologized for bothering\nthem at home and said, “My cousin, the Pillar of No Peak, has\nasked me to act for the clan,” which made it clear he was\nmaking this request not as a junior colleague but as a\nrepresentative of the Kaul family. He assured the men they\ncould expect to be rewarded for their trouble and have their\ntravel expenses taken care of.\nAfter both physicians had agreed to make the trip, Anden\nmade one final call to Kaul Dushuron Academy and dialed the\nextension for the boys’ dormitory, followed by a two-digit\nroom number. A couple of years ago, personal phones had\nbeen installed in each of the students’ rooms, a luxury that\nAnden had never had when he was there.

When you’re over there, do you wear\none of those money belts under your clothes to stop\npickpockets?” Niko was an unusually cautious teenager, prone\nto imagining worst-case scenarios. After Anden explained that\nthe area he was visiting in Adamont Capita was perfectly safe,\nhis nephew asked, “Can you bring me back a bag of those sour\nsweets, like you did last time?” Anden promised to do so.\nAfter a frustratingly long wait on hold with Kekon Air,\nAnden managed to book himself onto a direct flight to AC the\nfollowing afternoon. The only seats left available in the main\ncabin were middle seats near the back of the aircraft. At the\nairport check-in counter, Anden spent a doubtful minute\ndebating the issue with himself before upgrading to business\nclass. Even when given full authority by his cousins, he was\nalways hesitant to spend the clan’s money, as he held no\nofficial rank in No Peak, and felt that he was in some sort of\nperpetual debt on account of how the Kaul family had raised\nhim and paid for a Green Bone’s education at Kaul Dushuron\nAcademy, followed by an Espenian associate’s degree, and\nthen medical school at the College of Bioenergetic Medicine—\nall for what?\nHe was doing well enough for himself as a physician, his\nrelationships with the Kekonese-Espenians in Port Massy had\nbenefited the clan on both sides of the Amaric Ocean, and for\nyears he’d been acting as the liaison between Martgen’s\nresearch team and the Green Bone doctors in Janloon. But his\nadoptive grandfather, the late Kaul Seningtun, let the gods\nrecognize him, had brought an orphan boy into his home\nexpecting to add a prodigious jade warrior to the family, one\nthat could help his own grandchildren lead the clan. Anden\nknew his cousins would not evaluate his worth in such a\nmercenary way, but he imagined other people did. Lott Jin had\noutright said as much when he’d suggested Anden could’ve\nbeen First Fist in his place. Anden often told himself that at the\nage of thirty-one, he was done caring about what others\nthought of him, but nevertheless, he couldn’t help but feel he\nstill had something to prove.\nOnce he was on the plane, Anden had no regrets about his\ndecision. After a twelve-and-a-half-hour red-eye flight, he\nwould have to arrive in the capital city of Espenia prepared to\nput his jade abilities on public display while facing skeptical\nand hostile foreign policymakers. It was more important that\nhe be well rested and not fail his clan, his vocation, or his\ncountry than save a couple thousand dien.\n_______\nWhen Anden arrived at the Capita View Hotel, he was met by\nDr. Martgen and Rigly Hollin, who sat down with him in the\nhotel restaurant.

        "text": "When Anden arrived at the Capita View Hotel, he was met by\nDr. Martgen and Rigly Hollin, who sat down with him in the\nhotel restaurant. Dr. Martgen was obviously under a great deal\nof stress; he had dark hollows under his pale eyes, and his\nnormally trim beard looked coarse and unkempt. He wore the\nbrave but fearful expression of a man facing the firing squad.\nMartgen’s research into and championing of bioenergetic\nmedicine had made him a pariah among many of his peers in\nthe medical community, and if the legalization bill before the\nNational Assembly failed, it would likely mean the end of his\ncareer.\nRigly Hollin, in contrast, was as excited and intensely\nfocused as an athlete before competition. At times, Anden had\nto ask him to slow down or repeat himself simply to\nunderstand what he was saying. “This is great news for us,\nreally great,” he declared. “Assemblyman Sonnen gave us\nexactly what we need, a public demonstration. Anyone can\ndismiss or discredit data in a report. They can’t argue against\nwhat people see with their own eyes. The ball is on our box\nline and it’s our rucket now.”\nThe sports reference was lost on Anden, who’d never\ndeveloped an understanding or appreciation for the game of\nruckets, but he was encouraged by the man’s optimism. Rigly\nHollin was the vice president of the advertising and public\nrelations firm WBH Focus. He was married to a Kekonese\nwoman. During a trip to Janloon five years ago, she had\nencouraged her husband to seek out bioenergetic medical\ntreatment for a sports injury that had plagued him for more\nthan a decade. Amazed by the improvement he experienced,\nHollin was disappointed to discover that the practice was not\nlegally available in Espenia, except in conjunction with a few\nmedical research programs. That was how he’d come in\ncontact with Dr. Elan Martgen. Since then, Hollin’s company\nhad partnered with Martgen and his colleagues to run a major\ncampaign to raise awareness of bioenergetic medicine and\npush for its legalization. WBH Focus shot and ran a thirty-\nminute documentary on major television networks, publicized\nthe results of Martgen’s research in national newspapers, and\ncollected hundreds of thousands of signatures petitioning\nlawmakers.\nAll the funding for the effort came indirectly from the No\nPeak clan. Demphey Medical Research Center was a nonprofit\ninstitution dependent on government grants; it could never\nafford to pay for film shoots and ads in major newspapers.\nEvery year, the Weather Man’s office issued a generous annual\ndonation to the College of Bioenergetic Medicine, earmarked\nfor cultural exchange and academic partnerships. The money,\nKaul Shae had made abundantly clear, was meant for one\npurpose: promoting jade medicine in Espenia.\nMartgen and Hollin explained to Anden that the\ndemonstration would take place in a local private clinic that\nhad agreed to a shortterm lease on available space. Imaging\nequipment would be available on-site. The Espenian\nPhysicians Society would send observers, and Hollin had\narranged for news reporters and cameramen to be present.\nAnden and the two other Kekonese doctors, who were due to\narrive tomorrow, would see anyone who requested treatment."

It doesn’t change easily,\nespecially when it comes to accepting influences from other\ncountries and cultures.”\nAccording to conversations Anden heard around the Kaul\nfamily dinner table, the Mountain clan was now bypassing the\nembargo on the Uwiwa Islands via subsidiary operations in\nEast Oortoko run by their barukan allies. There were also signs\nit was trying to enter Espenia, which for many years had been\nNo Peak’s greatest advantage. “As much as Ayt plays the anti-\nforeigner card in public, she knows the ROE is too big and\nimportant to leave to us,” Hilo had said. “It’s only a matter of\ntime before the Mountain makes a move.”\nAnden’s anxiety was rising, but he managed a smile. “I\nshould get some sleep,” he said to Martgen and Hollin. “It\nsounds like I’m going to be busy.”\n_______\nAnden would later recall the two weeks he spent at the clinic\nin Adamont Capita as one of the most exhausting and\nprofessionally challenging periods of his career. He saw over\ntwo hundred patients personally. Dr. Timo and Dr. Yon saw\neven more than that, so in total roughly eight hundred people\nwere treated. The ailments Anden encountered varied\nconsiderably. Some people had chronic pain, nagging injuries,\nulcers, or wounds that he treated by increasing blood flow to\nthe affected areas and stimulating healing. Others needed\nkidney stones or arterial plaque broken up with precise\nChanneling. Anden cut blood supply to a number of tumors\nand fibroids, preventing them from growing any larger. On\nseveral occasions, the work was purely diagnostic—\nunexplained illness or pain that required him to strain his\nPerception and search out some abnormality in the body that\nmight then have to be more finely imaged using MRI or CT\nscans or treated with physical medicine.\nMost of the people who showed up seemed willing to try\nanything that might help them, and happy to receive free\nhealthcare, but Anden worked in the shadow of several\nEspenian doctors who came in and watched him suspiciously,\nmaking notes and scowling, sometimes interrogating the\npatients to make sure they were real and not planted actors.\nAnden fielded questions from reporters and tried to keep up a\ncommentary for the video cameras in the room. He explained\nto observers that the Kekonese martial discipline of\nChanneling was the basis for all bioenergetic medicine, but in\nthe medical field, the word was rarely used, as it encompassed\nseveral distinct branches of treatment, categorized depending\non whether the purpose was to increase, decrease, or redirect\nenergy, the speed and force at which this was done, and the\nbody system that was being manipulated—vascular,\nneurological, and so on.\nAnden had never used his jade abilities at such a sustained"

Several legislators and journalists who were\ntreated by the Kekonese physicians, or who had friends or\nfamily members who’d come to the clinic, were so impressed\nthat they were now public supporters of the legalization bill,\nwhich had become widely reported upon in the news. Word of\nthe visiting Green Bone doctors had spread, and hundreds\nmore people showed up at the clinic, hoping to get in, some of\nthem standing outside on the sidewalk for hours. Most,\nunfortunately, had to be turned away, causing a convenient\npublic outcry. “I came to Adamont Capita hoping to influence\nlegislation, not work as a charity nurse,” Dr. Yon grumbled at\none point, seeing the long line snaking outside the waiting\nroom of the small clinic.\nBy the end of the two weeks, Anden felt as if his sense of\nPerception was so burned-out that the energy around him had\nsmeared into a dim and indistinguishable blur in his mind, and\nhe doubted he could muster the strength to Channel enough to\nstun a mouse. Dr. Timo and Dr. Yon were also worn-out, and\nalthough they were both passionate supporters of spreading\njade medicine to the world, they intimated to Anden on more\nthan one occasion that all this work had better be worth it.\nPerhaps, they mused aloud, the Weather Man of No Peak\nwould be pleased enough by this effort that she would talk to\nthe dean of the College of Bioenergetic Medicine about giving\nraises to certain members of the faculty.\nMartgen and Hollin were ecstatic. “The vote on\nlegalization will happen by the end of the week,” Hollin told\nAnden. The Espenian Physicians Society had made an effort to\nhave it further delayed pending “additional research,” but\nAssemblyman Sonnen had denied the request. “We’re in the\nend rucket,” Hollin declared. “The will of the people can’t be\ndenied.”\nThe ad executive’s optimism was premature. Forty-eight\nhours before the scheduled vote, two lawyers knocked on\nAnden’s hotel room door. The Espenian Physicians Society\nhad successfully argued that the practitioner leading the\ndemonstration ought to be questioned by legislators about his\nbackground and his ties to the No Peak clan. Anden was\nsummoned to appear in front of a special hearing by the\nNational Panel on Health the following morning.\n_______\nThis must be what it’s like to be on trial, Anden thought. He\nwas seated alone at a small table with a microphone, facing a\nlong, raised semicircular bench with a dozen Espenian\nlawmakers staring down at him. They had perfunctorily\nqueried him about his academic and professional credentials,\nall in a tone of polite interest, and now it seemed they were\nfinally ready to get to the heart of the matter."

Most of them, however,\nremained stone-faced as they regarded him. Anden said, “I\ngraduated from Kaul Dushuron Academy, one of the best\nmartial academies in the country. Many, but not all, graduates\ngo on to join the No Peak clan. Others, such as myself, go into\nother professions, including medicine.”\nAnother panel member said, “But you are a still a member\nof the No Peak clan, correct?”\n“Most people who live in Janloon are affiliated with the\nGreen Bone clans in some way,” Anden explained. “They’re\nvital institutions in our country, like the Trade Societies here in\nEspenia.”\n“For the people in this room who are not familiar with\nthese Green Bone clans,” said Gilspar, looking around at his\nfellow panelists importantly, “they effectively control the\nmining, processing, and distribution of Kekonese bioenergetic\njade, nationally and internationally, legally and illegally. Their\npower in that small country is such that you could even\ndescribe them as a shadow government. And they’re not above\nusing whatever means they deem necessary to achieve their\naims, including violence.”\n“Sounds like a Trade Society, all right,” quipped a reporter,\nto some laughter.\nAssemblyman Sonnen said, “What is the purpose of this\nline of questioning, Dr. Gilspar?”\nDr. Gilspar raised his voice defensively; it echoed in the\nofficiously high-ceilinged chamber. “Mr. Chairman, I’m trying\nto ascertain whether Dr. Emery and his cohorts have motives\ncontrary to the best interests of Espenian patients.” He turned\nback to Anden. “Since you were raised in the ruling family,\nyou’re not an ordinary member of No Peak, are you, Dr.\nEmery? Is it accurate to say that you are, in fact, a leader in the\nclan?”\nAnden leaned forward to speak more clearly into the\nmicrophone. “I’m personally close to the Kaul family, but I\nhold no title or rank in the No Peak clan. As a physician, I’m\nnot beholden to any clan. My duty is to use jade abilities to\nheal those in need of care.”\n“However, you admit you’ve used your abilities to commit"

We’re here to\ndecide whether to approve the legal use of bioenergetic jade\nfor medical purposes, not investigate every aspect of Dr.\nEmery’s upbringing and personal character.” Mumbles of\nagreement traveled through the room, and for the first time,\nAnden saw politicians nodding their heads.\nAnden felt a surge of appreciation toward Sonnen. He’d\nbeen starting to wonder if anyone was going to point out the\nEPS representative’s increasingly biased and irrelevant lines of\ninquiry. Gilspar, however, was not done. Feeling the tide turn\nagainst him, he placed his fists on the table and half rose from\nhis seat, speaking with even greater vehemence. “Mr.\nChairman, it’s obvious what’s going on here. The Kekonese\nmake millions of thalirs selling jade through military contracts\nto the ROE. The clans ruling that island are ruthless, barbaric\norganizations, and now they want to take over our healthcare\nmarket as well. Are we going to let them do that? Are we\nreally going to give a bunch of kecks legal license to practice\ntheir unTruthful methods on people in this country?”\nThe room broke into exclamations and heated discussion.\nThe back of Anden’s neck burned hot, and the shirt he wore\nunder his dark suit was sticking to the small of his back with\nsweat, but he remained silent in his seat, showing none of his\nanger as voices rose around him and journalists snapped\nphotographs. When he was younger, Anden had believed the\npeople of Espenia to be like his own biological father—\nshallow, arrogant, faithless. Since then, he’d met enough\nEspenians to know that was simply a stereotype like any other,\nbut this man who’d spoken so forcefully and rudely, this\nGilspar—he was the sort of Espenian that made his people\nhated in the world. He spoke confident part-truths on things he\nknew nothing about, he had the conceit to judge others on the\nbasis of his own hypocritical standards and motives, and he\ndared to show contempt for a stranger’s family.\nAssemblyman Sonnen banged a gavel and called for a\nthirtyminute recess. “Dr. Emery, please wait in the visitor’s\nlounge until we decide whether we’ve any need to ask you\nfurther questions.”\nAnden was all too eager to escape.

Martgen and Hollin met\nAnden there. They had only been allowed to watch the session\nfrom the panel room’s balcony. Martgen was pale and wiping\nhis brow, looking as if he’d been the one interrogated. Hollin\nclapped Anden on the back and said he’d handled everything\nperfectly and been the picture of credible professional calm\ncompared to Gilspar.\nAnden used the phone in the room to dial the front desk of\nthe Capita View Hotel and ask if he’d received any messages.\nHe’d explained the situation to Shae yesterday evening as soon\nas he learned what he would be facing, and he wanted to know\nif his cousins had any further instructions for him. The\nreceptionist at the hotel told him that he had indeed received a\nmessage; she patched him through to the voicemail system. To\nAnden’s surprise, Hilo’s voice said, “Andy, call me at the\nhouse when you get this message. Call the family line. Use a\npay phone. Don’t worry if it’s late over here, call anyway.”\nThere were pay phones inside the building, but Anden was\nnot sure they would count as secure enough. He made an\nexcuse to go outside, saying he needed a smoke to calm his\nnerves, which was not entirely untrue. There was a phone\nbooth a block down the street. Anden called collect to a\nnumber that went straight to the Pillar’s study. He looked at his\nwristwatch; it was nearly midnight back in Janloon. Hilo\npicked up on the third ring.\n“How’re things going over there, cousin?” Hilo asked.\nAnden gave the Pillar a succinct report of what had happened.\nHilo said, “Shae has people digging into this man, Gilspar. He\ntakes a lot of money from the pharmaceutical companies.\nAlso, he has at least two mistresses. If we have to shut him up,\nwe can do it, but you’ve been doing a good job, so let’s wait\nand see what happens.”\nAnden couldn’t help venting a little. “Hilo-jen, I’m\nashamed to have any Espenian blood.”\n“Don’t say that, Andy,” Hilo scolded. “You’re going to let\nthe words of some water-blooded spenny bureaucrat make you\nfeel bad about yourself? Haven’t I always said that in your\ncase, some foreign blood made you better? Hasn’t it been good\nfor us that you can go around in that country looking like one\nof them?” Hilo paused and Anden heard the phone go muffled\nfor a moment, perhaps held against Hilo’s shoulder as he said,\nwith mock severity, “Hey, you’re not too old to hug your da\ngood night, are you?”—no doubt speaking to Ru, the only one\nof his children still living at the Kaul house since Jaya had\ngone off to the Academy this year. Seconds later, Hilo came\nback onto the line. “Anyway, you’ve done everything you can\nthere. I need you to go to Resville.

They know we’ve got too\nmuch strength in Port Massy, so they’ve gone somewhere else,\nhoping we won’t notice. We’ve got to wipe them out.

Thirty minutes had gone\nby and he was supposed to be inside, waiting to hear if he\nwould be called back in front of the panel for further\nquestioning. He’d already been in Adamont Capita for sixteen\ndays. As a jade-wearing Kekonese citizen, he was only\nallowed to remain in the ROE for twenty days at a time, and\nhe’d hoped to use his last few allowable days in the country to\nvisit Port Massy and see Mr. Hian, who was in his eighties\nnow. With Mrs. Hian gone—let the gods recognize her—who\nknew how much longer Mr. Hian had to live? Resville was\nnowhere near Port Massy.\n“I have to go back inside, Hilo-jen, I’m late,” Anden said.\n“I might still be stuck here for a while, I don’t know yet. Of\ncourse, if we have a chance to destroy the Mountain in\nResville before they get a foothold in this country, we should\ntake it, but I can’t leave without any warning, it’ll be\nsuspicious. I’ll call you again tonight, first thing in the\nmorning your time.”\nAfter he hung up the phone, Anden hurried back into the\nbuilding, arriving ten minutes late and out of breath,\napologizing to an anxious Dr. Martgen and saying he’d gone to\nthe wrong entrance and gotten lost in the corridors. As it\nturned out, he needn’t have rushed; it was another forty-five\nminutes before he was called back into the room before the\npanel.\nGilspar appeared flushed and deeply sullen. He did not\nspeak or get a chance to ask any further questions.\nAssemblyman Sonnen cleared his throat and said to the room,\n“A majority of this panel has moved that the proposed\nlegislation to legalize the use of bioenergetic jade for medical\npurposes proceed to a vote in the National Assembly\ntomorrow morning. We’ve heard enough from both sides of\nthis debate, and despite some fiercely dissenting opinions, the\nevidence gathered is incontrovertible.”\nSeveral observers in the room began to applaud, but\nSonnen held up a hand. “Dr. Emery, before I declare you free\nto go, I want to thank you for your hard work, patience, and\nadvocacy. It’s inspiring to see an accomplished biracial\nindividual such as yourself showcasing the best of your\nheritage. The number of patients you’ve helped in the last two\nweeks is a testament to your dedication as a physician, and to\nthe extent you’ve faced insensitive or prejudiced comments, I\nhope they pale in comparison to the many people who are"

        "text": "weeks is a testament to your dedication as a physician, and to\nthe extent you’ve faced insensitive or prejudiced comments, I\nhope they pale in comparison to the many people who are\neager to embrace what other cultures have to offer.”\nAnden thanked Assemblyman Sonnen and left the room\namid appreciative applause. He stayed just long enough to\naccept relieved handshakes from Dr. Martgen and several\nmembers of his research group, and pleased backslaps from\nRigly Hollin and his team. Anden returned to his hotel room\nand packed his bags. The following morning, after two hours\nof debate, the National Assembly voted, by a slim majority, to\nlegalize the medical use of bioenergetic jade. By then, Anden\nwas on a flight to Resville, on the orders of the Pillar, to see to\nthe destruction of the clan’s enemies.\nCHAPTER\n16\nAll Business\nT\nhe address provided by his cousins led Anden into an\nindustrial part of Resville, to a converted warehouse with no\nsign above the door. It was much warmer here than it had been\nin Adamont Capita. The stucco walls were sun-bleached and\nthe surrounding concrete gleamed almost white in the dry heat.\nThe inside of the building was dim in comparison to the stark\nmidday sun outside and smelled strongly of stale sweat. Anden\nhad expected something like the grudge hall he’d known in\nPort Massy—a secret training hall for Green Bones, converted\ninto a social gathering spot in the evening—but the space he\nstepped into now bore little resemblance to the basement of\nthe Kekonese community center in Southtrap. Most of the\nwarehouse floor was taken up by what appeared to be a\nfighting ring with battered blue mats covering the concrete\nfloor, cordoned off with thick floor-to-ceiling mesh barriers.\nThe ring was not empty; scattered throughout the space were\nstacked wooden crates, metal oil drums, and cement blocks.\nRopes dangled from the girders, and horizontal steel beams\nhung from above, suspended at either end by thick chains.\nInside the enclosed space, two Green Bones were sparring\nin dramatic fashion—leaping Light off the obstacles, hurling\nDeflections that sent ropes swinging and metal drums\ntumbling and rolling, clashing Strength against Strength, and\nSteeling against blows that sent them careening into splintered\nwooden crates. The men were not trying to truly hurt each\nother, but it was impressive to watch such a thrilling display of\njade abilities—and in Espenia, of all places, where Green\nBones had to practice in secret. Kaul Du Academy had some\nlarge, elaborate training fields and on certain occasions such as\nHeroes Day, the school would open its doors to the public and\nsenior students would put on showy public demonstrations.\nThis struck Anden as a low-budget version of that display, in\nan illicit, somewhat sordid environment.\nA man was standing outside of the mesh barrier, watching\nthe fighters and shouting at them. Most of his exclamations\nwere expletives of encouragement or disappointment, like a\nspectator standing in front of a televised sporting match.\n“Fuck, yeah!” he bellowed, then, “Seer’s balls, you’re gonna\nlet him do that to you? Move, goddamnit!” Anden walked up\nbeside the man, who noticed him and gave him a brief,"

        "text": "let him do that to you? Move, goddamnit!” Anden walked up\nbeside the man, who noticed him and gave him a brief,\nunwelcoming glance, but didn’t turn his attention away from\nthe action. The man was young, Anden noticed, in his\nmidtwenties, and handsome in a brutish way, with sharp\nshoulders and elbows, dark lips and a strong brow. He wore\nfaded jeans and an untucked black T-shirt. Elaborate tattoos\nwound up both his forearms. Anden could not see any jade on\nhim—the Kekonese in Espenia did not wear jade openly—but\nAnden knew this man was a Green Bone, not only because\nhe’d been told beforehand, but because even without his own\njade, standing near the stranger, Anden could sense the edges\nof his aura, bright and cutting.\nA loud bell went off, presumably to end the match.\nBreathing heavily and wiping their brows, the two fighters\ninside the ring stopped their contest and met in the center of\nthe floor to slap hands and digress into their own conversation.\nAnden spoke to the man next to him. “Are you Jon Remi?”\n“Who’s asking?” said the man, eyeing Anden.\nAnden turned and touched his head in abbreviated salute.\n“I’m Emery Anden of the No Peak clan,” he said in Kekonese.\n“My cousins send their regards from Janloon. As does Dauk\nLosunyin in Port Massy.”\nRemi Jonjunin, better known as Jon Remi, did not entirely\nlose his standoffish manner, but he gave Anden his full\nattention now and said, in a more amicable voice, “So you’re\nthe man sent by the Kauls. I’ve heard about you. You were\nfriends with Rohn Toro, back in the day.”\n“Let the gods recognize him,” Anden added.\n“I didn’t know him,” Remi said with a shrug, switching\nback to speaking in Espenian. “I was only a kid, and Port\nMassy is fucking far away from Resville. Just heard about\nhim, like he was some kind of an urban legend. Greenest man\nin the country, they said. Went out in a bad way, though.\nFucking Crews.”\nAnden said, “It’s true that he was the greenest man in the\ncountry.”\n“And how’s old man Dauk doing these days?” Remi asked.\n“Still cheating the grave, that one?”\nEven though Dauk Losun was not truly a clan Pillar,\nAnden was not accustomed to hearing anyone speak of the\naging Green Bone leader, the most influential in Port Massy\nand indeed all of Espenia, with such flippancy. Jon Remi,\nAnden had been told, was an ally of the Dauks and the man to\nspeak to in Resville about all Green Bone matters. Espenians\nwere more casual, and Remi had been born in this country, so\nperhaps there was no disrespect intended. Still, Anden\nanswered guardedly now, following Remi back into Espenian,\nas that seemed to be what the man preferred. “I haven’t had a\nchance to see Dauk-jen in person during this trip, but I hear\nhe’s doing well and has a fifth grandchild now, a boy.”"

The two Green Bones in the prop-strewn ring\nwere stepping out through a pulled-back flap in the mesh\nbarrier. “You see that man, the one with the longer hair?”\nRemi said, changing the subject as he pointed across the floor\nat the fighters. “Danny,” he hollered, “you’re a fucking jade\nanimal, you’re gonna kill everyone in the auditions, crumb.”\nThe other Green Bone waved in thanks, and Remi said with\npride, “That’s Danny Sinjo, he’s been fighting in the shows in\nMarcucuo for two years, already got an 8–1 record and now\nhe’s been scouted for a role in a gangster flick by a Shotarian\nmovie studio. Just remember, when you see him on the big\nscreen in a few years, you can say you met him in Resville\nbefore he got famous, right here in Jon Remi’s club.”\nAnden was not familiar with half of what Remi had said,\nbut he took a long look at Sinjo and even from a distance\nagreed that he could be movie star material, at least when it\ncame to physical appeal. Although, Anden admitted to himself\nglumly, his standards for attractiveness might be growing more\ngenerous. He winced inwardly, thinking of Lott Jin. What had\nhe been expecting, reaching for a shallow teenage infatuation?\nRejection wouldn’t sting so badly if he had other options,\nbut it had been a long time since he’d had anything he might\ndescribe as romantic prospects. Part of the difficulty was that\nhe’d spent his twenties in medical school and starting his\ncareer as a physician, but the larger problem was that he had\nno real idea how to meet suitable partners in Janloon. He had\nno interest in going to some of the places where men typically\nwent to meet each other for casual encounters. He was too\nwell known as a member of the Kaul family and didn’t want to\nbe seen in places and situations that would reflect poorly on\nhim.\n“I didn’t think a Shotarian movie studio would hire a\nKekonese Green Bone,” he said to Remi.\n“Sure they would. Danny’s going for the role of the main\nvillain, the barukan gang boss who kills the cop’s wife and\nkids. They’re popular, you know, the Shotarian crime dramas.\nAll over the world. Big money in movies.” Remi led the way\nacross the floor of the warehouse, around the perimeter of the\nfighting ring, to an area with a pool table and several cracked\nleather sectional sofas. He flopped down on one of them and\ngestured grandly. “So, what do you think? As good as the\ngyms in Janloon?”\nAnden did not want to say no, but he suspected Remi was\nasking the question merely to goad him into polite lying,\nwhich would be embarrassingly apparent to someone who\ncould Perceive it. Instead he said, “I didn’t expect there to be a\nplace like this in Espenia. Aren’t you worried about the\npolice?”"

Aren’t you worried about the\npolice?”\nRemi showed his teeth in a smile, as if he’d been expecting\nAnden to ask the question. “Resville is a Crew town, crumb.\nWe’re less than a third the size of Port Massy, but we’ve got at\nleast six Crews jostling for a piece of the action. And on top of\nthat, the drug cartels from Tomascio. The police, they don’t\npay attention to a few kecks with jade.” There was scorn, even\nresentment, in Remi’s voice. “Resville’s different from the rest\nof the country. Let’s just say rules here are more … relaxed.”\nNo wonder, then, that this was where the Mountain had\nchosen to make a major entry into the country. Located only\nfifty kilometers from the border with Tomascio, Resville\npossessed year-round good weather, warm beaches, and\ncopious entertainments that made it one of the country’s top\ntourist locations. Anden sat down on the sofa across from\nRemi and said, “So you own this place?”\n“My uncle owns it,” Remi said. “I run it for him. It does all\nright. We hold matches here every month, and we fill the space\nabout half the time. We’re not nearly as big as the jadesports\nevents at Marcucuo, but it’s more intimate here. Some of what\nthey do is fake, choreographed. The only thing you can’t do\nhere is lethal Channeling. Otherwise, we’re no-holds-barred.\nSo this is one of the few places on the continent guys can\ncome to train and get amateur experience before trying to go\nbig time in Marcucuo.”\nAnden felt he knew less than he should about the seedy\nworld of jade combat for sport and profit. In Kekon, jade was\nnot permitted in professional athletics of any kind. Green\nBones were expected to adhere to aisho and serve their clans,\nor else use their abilities in noble professions such as\nmedicine, teaching, or religion. Anden was sure that Hilo\nwould curl his lip at the idea of a jade warrior stepping into a\nring in front of a howling audience to win attention and money\nfor himself. There were, however, obviously people who did it\nanyway, in places where such things were legal or at least\noverlooked. Anden couldn’t help but think of Jon Remi as a\nlower type of Green Bone, not at all respectable.\nNevertheless, No Peak had bargained and associated with\ndisreputable people before when necessary—from motorcycle\ngangs in Janloon, to the Crews, and the Espenian government\nitself. Anden had long ago learned not to hold Keko-Espenians\nand their ways to the same standards as Kekonese. According\nto No Peak’s sources, Jon Remi was the top Green Bone in the\ncity of Resville. He possessed a loyal group of followers, and\nhe kept the Crews and the police out of Kekonese\nneighborhoods and businesses. He managed fighting dens,\nwhorehouses, even shine dealers—unsavory activities—but a\nman who did not follow the rules was the sort of ally they"

He managed fighting dens,\nwhorehouses, even shine dealers—unsavory activities—but a\nman who did not follow the rules was the sort of ally they\nneeded in Resville at the moment. Anden said mildly, “I\nobviously have a lot to learn about this part of the country.”\n“We’ve never had close ties to the guys in Port Massy.\nSure, we respect Dauk, and we follow the rules about keeping\njade to ourselves. We’ve hosted visiting Fists from Janloon,\nand some of our people have gone to train in the old country\nand brought back some useful skills. I’m all for keeping up\nconnections.” Jon Remi crossed his arms. The tattoo of a black\nskull with snakes coming out of its eyes grinned at Anden\nfrom across the distance between them. “But we’ve always run\nthings separate from Port Massy and from Janloon. So tell me:\nWhy’s the No Peak clan suddenly interested in Resville?”\n“We go where our enemies are,” Anden replied.\nRemi said, “You mean the Mountain clan.”\n“They’re buying their way into new construction here.\nThey have a controlling stake in the Sands of Illusion casino\nover on the east side, and they’re establishing a foothold in\nretail, restaurants, and sports betting.” All areas where the\nMountain had traditionally been strong in Janloon. “Whatever\nprofits they make here, they’ll send back to Kekon to use\nagainst No Peak. So you can see why this is a concern to us.”\n“And your cousins sent you here to talk to me about it.”\nRemi smiled. “We don’t have many people in this city\nourselves,” Anden said.\n“We need a local partner. I was told that you were the\nperson to talk to. It would be worthwhile for you, more\nprofitable than this club.”\n“You’re not the only one who’s looking for a partner, you\nknow.” Remi leaned forward, his eyes fixed on Anden. “The\nMountain has less here than you do. How do you imagine they\nplan to protect their investment from so far away, especially\nagainst the Crews, and against their mortal enemies, the\nKauls?”\nAt Remi’s words and the abruptly low, shrewd tone of his\nvoice, Anden understood at once that he and his cousins had\nbeen preempted. The Mountain had already approached Jon\nRemi for an alliance. Anden half expected to be attacked and\nkilled in that moment. He had to resist the urge to look around\nwildly for enemies. Yet no one emerged from some unseen\nposition to slit his throat, and Remi remained seated exactly\nwhere he was, smiling, knowing full well that Anden’s\nthoughts were racing with calculation and unease.\nAnden sat still and kept his eyes on the other man’s face. If\nJon Remi was already working for Ayt Mada, he wouldn’t\nhave given Anden any chance. He must still be in play.\nAnden said, calmly, “What did the Mountain offer you?”\n“Exactly what you’d expect,” Remi said. “Money,\nmanpower, and jade, in exchange for protecting the\nMountain’s properties and business interests in Resville from\ncrewboys and the No Peak clan.”\nAnden nodded. “And what did you tell them?”"

You’re a\nguest from Janloon, so let me show you a good time. I\nwouldn’t want anyone to say that a representative of the No\nPeak clan left Resville without enjoying what the city has to\noffer.” Remi stood. “Meet me at the Blue Olive tonight. Say\nyou’re with me, and they’ll let you upstairs. That way I can\nbuy you a drink, before you try to buy my loyalty.”\n_______\n“This man, Remi,” Anden said to Hilo over the phone. “He\nseems green enough on the outside, but he was born in\nEspenia and I don’t have a good feeling about him. As far as I\ncan tell, he doesn’t respect anything and doesn’t answer to\nanyone. I wouldn’t want him working for the Mountain as our\nenemy, but even as an ally, I wouldn’t say we can trust him.”\n“Can he do what we want him to?” Hilo asked. “That’s as\nfar as we need to trust him.”\n“How much are we willing to give him, Hilo-jen?” Anden\nlooked at the clock on the hotel room table. “It has to be better\nthan whatever the Mountain is offering. Would you grant him\nthe same status as a tributary like the Jo Sun clan?” Anden\nmade a face that the Pillar could not see. It seemed ludicrous\nto give a young Keko-Espenian gang leader like Jon Remi the\nsame consideration as the Pillar of a minor Green Bone clan,\nbut then again, Resville was a bigger city than anything the Jo\nSun clan controlled.\nThere was also the possibility that if Remi decided to side\nwith the Mountain, or had already done so and was deceiving\nAnden with this meeting, he might not walk out of the Blue\nOlive nightclub at all.\n“Andy,” Hilo said, “I can’t say exactly without having met\nthis man in person. I’d be there myself if I could be, but then\nthe Mountain would know right away what we’re doing.\nFigure out what he wants and give him no more than that.\nDon’t let him get above his place or show disrespect, but make\nthis happen for us. It’s important. You’ve talked to Shae so\nyou already know the numbers. I trust you, Andy.”\n_______\nAnden did not have anything appropriate to wear to the Blue\nOlive; he’d packed for a work trip and not a Resville\nnightclub. He bought an overpriced resort-wear T-shirt from\nthe hotel gift shop and wore it with black jeans and his suit\njacket and formal shoes. He wouldn’t be allowed to carry any\nweapons into the club, but for a long moment, he sat on the\nedge of the hotel bed and fingered the band of jade stones he\nwore only when treating patients.

If something went wrong, if\nRemi was luring him into a trap on behalf of the Mountain,\nhaving his jade abilities might mean the difference between\nlife and death.\nAnden shut his jade into the room’s safe. His instincts told\nhim that if Jon Remi meant to harm him, he would already\nhave done so. And if he started carrying his jade whenever he\nfelt there might be danger, he might as well abandon his one\nironclad personal rule and start wearing jade constantly. In no\ntime at all, he would be back to being a Green Bone warrior of\nthe clan, forced to kill or be killed.\nHe arrived at the Blue Olive to discover that he had\noverdressed, or rather, dressed incorrectly for the venue. A\ncrush of half-naked bodies filled the dance floor, which\nthrobbed with a mix of Espenian and Tomascian club music\nand red strobe lights. Two dancers of indeterminate gender\ngyrated in raised cages in the center of the crowd. Black vinyl\nstools surrounded the mirrored bar. As Anden passed,\nsearching for the staircase, an older man in a fishnet top\ngrabbed his ass. At first, Anden was too surprised to react.\nThen he did so without thinking, seizing the man’s wrist,\ntwisting it into a painful lock and slamming it against the bar\ntop. The man screamed a curse over the loud music, but Anden\nwas already regretting causing a scene. He let go and pushed\npast the people nearby, losing himself in the club’s dark\nconfines before the injured man or anyone else could pursue\nhim. The staircase upstairs was barred with a velvet rope and\ntwo bouncers, who let Anden through when he said he was\nthere to see Jon Remi.\nHe found Remi in the company of two trans women in\nidentical red miniskirts who were both laughing at some joke\nhe’d made. Two surly Kekonese men, who Anden assumed to\nbe Remi’s subordinates or bodyguards, loitered nearby,\nappearing bored. They looked Anden over as he approached,\nbut at a word from their boss they let him pass. Remi smacked\nthe women on their rears and told them to leave, as he had\nbusiness to discuss. They did so with pouty faces, giving\nAnden coy looks as they left. Anden sat down across from\nRemi, who sat up and turned serious and solicitous.\n“What’ll you have to drink?” he asked. His pupils were\ndilated, his face slightly flushed.\n“I don’t suppose they serve hoji here,” Anden said,\nthinking he could really use one.\n“Nah, they should, though. It’s getting more popular, you\nknow.”\n“A beer, then,” Anden said. “Whatever you recommend.”\nRemi flagged down a server, who brought Anden a lager\nand Remi a glass of some clear hard liquor. Anden’s host\npulled the purple curtain across the booth shut and said, “So\nyou like this place? You check out the dance floor?

You’re on vacation, so just tell me what you want and\nI’ll hook you up. Do you like older men? Younger?”\nFor a second, Anden was astonished. Then he was\nintrigued and reluctantly tempted. He was far away from\nJanloon. No one could possibly recognize him as a member of\nthe Kaul family. He could have liaisons with as many strangers\nas he liked over here and never have to see them again. But on\nthe phone, he’d told Hilo that he wouldn’t fully trust Jon Remi\neven as an ally; letting the man procure sex for him struck\nAnden as unwise. He suspected Remi had brought him here to\nunbalance him, to gain some sort of personal leverage. “I’m\nnot on vacation,” he corrected.\nA brief flash of irritation, possibly anger, crossed Remi’s\nface. “All business, huh? You’re all clan, from the old country,\ntoo good for this scene?” When Anden didn’t answer the\nrhetorical question, Remi snorted as if it had all been a joke\nand leaned forward intently, his face close enough that his\nbrittle jade aura once again scratched at the edge of Anden’s\nPerception. “All right, then, since you want to get straight to it.\nThe Mountain will pay me a hundred and fifty thousand thalirs\na month, plus a kilo of cut jade. They’re allies with the\nbarukan, so I’ll get some muscle from the Shoto-Espenian\ngangs on my side here in Resville. Also, I’ll be able to buy\nshine at a discount straight from the Uwiwa Islands, and the\nbarukan say they can bring tourists from Shotar to the fighting\ndens and strip clubs.” Remi sat back. “I can’t think of many\nreasons to say no.”\nAnden took a swallow of his drink while he gathered his\nthoughts. “You’d be breaking your alliance with Dauk Losun,\nwho’s a friend of the No Peak clan. You’d have no more jade\nor support from Port Massy. The Mountain’s offer is lucrative,\nbut it only makes you a paid enforcer, not a proper tributary.\nYou won’t get a cut of their profits and you won’t be able to\ncount on them if you run into any trouble. No Peak has more\ninfluence and more legitimate business interests and lawyers\nin this country.”\nRemi shrugged. “I’ll take cold, hard cash over tributary\nstatus any day. What does that get me anyway? What do I care\nabout clan prestige in Kekon? Or lawyers in Port Massy, for\nthat matter?”\nAnden could see that he was playing this incorrectly and\ntried to adjust. “We can match the money and jade,” he said.\n“We can’t sell you shine or bring you Shotarian tourists, but\nwe can do something better. No Peak has an entire business\noffice with dozens of people in Port Massy. If we had the local\nsupport to open a satellite office here in Resville, it would\nmean jobs and investment and an influx of people to the\nKekonese population.

That’s more people and money directly\nto your businesses but also you would get a percentage of our\nprofits here. So the better we do, the better you would do as\nwell.” As he spoke, additional things occurred to him and he\nsaid, “We already have a system in place of sending Green\nBones between Kekon and Espenia for teaching and training\nopportunities. The fighters at your club, the up-and-coming\nones who’ll be the next Danny Sinjo, could take advantage of\nthat. And jade is legal for medical use now, because of the No\nPeak clan. You could have a foot in the door in that area.”\nRemi listened to all of this with a thoughtful, calculating\nexpression. “You’re putting me in a tough spot, crumb,” he\nsaid. He curled his bottom lip over his teeth and moved his jaw\nback and forth in a snidely indecisive manner. “Which clan\nshould I pimp myself to? I know you old country islanders\nwouldn’t normally waste your spit on a kespie punk like me,\nbut suddenly both of the big clans are eager to woo the locals\nso you can stick it to each other, as if you haven’t had enough\nopportunities to do so back home.” Remi shrugged with\nexaggerated indifference. “No Peak does have something in its\nfavor, though. Iwe Kalundo from the Mountain clan is a bald,\nugly fuck, and you’re not.”\nRemi unzipped his fly and pulled out his cock. It lay\nflaccid in the wedge of his open pants. A thin chain of jade\nstones sat bared across his pale, jutting hips. “Tell you what.\nYou suck me off, on behalf of the No Peak clan, and we have a\ndeal.” He locked eyes with Anden. “You want to do it anyway.\nAnd then I’ll do what your cousins ask. I’ll take your side in\nResville.”\nA prickly heat spread up Anden’s neck. Outside the\ncurtained booth, the muffled bass from the dance floor\ndownstairs throbbed. Anden could feel it through the soles of\nhis shoes, reverberating all the way up his spine to his head.\nSlowly, he shifted closer, until he was next to Remi on the\nbench. The man licked his lips, watching Anden’s every move\nwith anticipation.\nAnden said, in a low voice that he did not entirely\nrecognize as his own, “My cousin, the Pillar, told me to figure\nout what you want and to give it to you.” He brushed Remi’s\nhands aside and cupped the man’s balls. Remi’s cock began to\nstiffen. “It took me a bit of time to understand what that is.\n“You want your own power. You want to live by your own\nrules, not as a tool of others, not according to the terms set by\npeople who look down on you from both Kekon and Espenia.\nYou’re only a Resville kespie thug, so you have no choice but\nto choose between the big Kekonese clans at your door—but\nyou want do it with a member of the Kaul family sucking your\ndick.”\nAnden’s grip tightened on Remi’s testicles.

        "text": "you want do it with a member of the Kaul family sucking your\ndick.”\nAnden’s grip tightened on Remi’s testicles. The man’s eyes\nwidened and his jade aura swelled, its sharp edges grating\nacross Anden’s Perception like steel filings.\n“Forget everything I’ve said so far.” Anden had never been\non the military side of the clan, but he’d been raised as a Kaul\nand been around Fists all his life. So he knew instinctively\nhow to speak in the calm, decisive way that commanded\nattention, that suggested violence. In that moment, he thought\nof his cousin Lan and tried to speak exactly as the former\nPillar would have. “Here is the real offer. You get nothing,\nexcept this: a promise that No Peak will stay out of Resville,\nso long as the Mountain is gone from the city as well.\nWhatever you take from our enemies, you keep for yourself. If\nyou need money, people, jade, or anything else to accomplish\nthat, we can help with those things. Otherwise, we’ll confine\nour activities to Port Massy and other parts of the country. As\nlong as you maintain respect for Dauk’s authority and other\nGreen Bones, Resville will be yours. You have my word, on\nbehalf of the Kaul family of No Peak.\n“If you decide instead to side with the Mountain, we will\nsend our own people from Janloon and Port Massy and go to\nwar over this town. We’ve done it before in Kekon and we can\ndo it overseas, even if it costs us. One of the clans will prevail,\nor maybe the Crews will take advantage of the situation and\ndrive us both out, but whoever wins, it won’t be you. You’ll be\nin the middle, just street muscle, even lower than the barukan.”\nAnden pushed the man’s cock back into his pants and\nfastened the zipper with a yank. He stood up and looked down\nat Remi sprawled on the sofa. “My flight to Janloon leaves\ntomorrow evening. My cousins will be expecting to hear from\nme before then. If you want to be a hireling of the Mountain,\nthere’s no need to do anything. If you want something else,\ncall me before noon.”\nAnden walked out of the booth. He half expected Remi’s\ntwo bodyguards to stop him, but they did not move to do so.\nHe went down the staircase and out of the Blue Olive. Only\nwhen he was inside a taxi, out of range of the other man’s\nPerception, did his heart begin to race as adrenaline emptied\ninto his veins, as if his body had held back any reaction until it\nwas sure he was safe, so that in the important moment, not\neven a Green Bone could’ve sensed his fear and rage.\nCHAPTER\n17\nEnemies\nJ\nuen Nu was summoned to a Seventhday brunch meeting at\nthe Twice Lucky. It was not one of his preferred places to eat;\nhe personally thought the restaurant was overrated, riding on\nits long reputation and a few admittedly excellent signature\ndishes.

        "text": "city. But the Twice Lucky was a Kaul family favorite, and it\nwas impossible to be the Horn of No Peak without essentially\nbecoming an associate member of the Kaul family, so Juen had\nno choice but to eat there more than he would out of personal\ninclination.\nAt least, thank the gods, there was now air-conditioning\nthroughout the old building, so the dining room was a\nwelcome refuge from the oppressive summer heat. When he\narrived, the Pillar and his wife, the Weather Man and her\nhusband, and their cousin Anden were at their usual table near\nthe back and already partway through their meal. Whenever\nthe Kaul family ate at the Twice Lucky, the proprietor, Mr.\nUne, ensured the tables nearby remained empty, and a painted\nfolding screen cordoned them from sight of the rest of the\ndining room, so they could talk freely.\n“Kaul-jens,” Juen said, saluting informally before joining\nthem.\n“Juen-jen, there’s still steamed egg and nut pastries but\nonly two crispy squid balls left,” said Wen, filling his teacup.\n“We can order some more food if you’re feeling hungry.”\n“This is more than enough,” Juen assured her. With the\nPillar’s permission, he preferred to have an early breakfast\nwith his wife and children and spend the morning with them,\narriving late to the Twice Lucky and eating only lightly before\nclan discussion began. Even though he was the Horn and his\nfamily lived on the Kaul estate (a decision his wife had\nsupported for the sake of convenience and security), Juen did\nhis best to maintain some personal boundaries. He had no\ndesire to follow the fate of the tragic Maiks and see his own\nfamily subsumed into the Kauls. Despite all their strength, the\nKauls were unlucky—with not one, but two stone-eyes, as\nwell as an adopted cousin who was mixed race and queer. Juen\nliked the Kauls well enough, even the unlucky ones, and he\nwould follow Hilo-jen no matter what, but he very much\nhoped to preserve the luck of his own family, beat the odds of\noccupying his dangerous position, and live to see retirement\nand grandchildren.\nTaking Juen’s arrival as a cue that the leaders were about\nto begin discussing clan issues, Anden put down his napkin\nand pushed back from the table to leave. Hilo said, “Do you\nhave anywhere else you need to be, Andy? If not, stay.” The\nsuggestion was made casually, but Anden and everyone else at\nthe table understood it to be an order. Anden hesitated,\nglancing around the table uncertainly, then sat back down.\nJuen sighed inwardly. The Pillar had already made his\nunlucky wife his Pillarman, and now he was bringing his\nunlucky cousin, who held no official rank in the clan, into the\ninner circle of the leadership, no doubt because the doctor had\nrecently accomplished so much in Espenia on the clan’s\nbehalf. Juen was not going to question the Pillar’s decisions in\nareas beyond the Horn’s purview, but he couldn’t help but\nwonder if so much ill fortune concentrated near the top was a\nhandicap on the entire clan that made his job as Horn more\nfraught in some invisible way."

        "text": "wonder if so much ill fortune concentrated near the top was a\nhandicap on the entire clan that made his job as Horn more\nfraught in some invisible way.\nHilo turned to Juen. “How was your trip?”\n“About what I expected.” Juen had recently returned to\nJanloon after three days in Lukang. The stalemate there had\npersisted for years and was unlikely to change so long as Jio\nSomu remained the Pillar of Six Hands Unity. No Peak\ncontinued to support Jio’s opponents, who would not rest in\ntheir goal to avenge the old Pillar and Weather Man and take\nback rightful control of the clan. “They want to send that kin\nkiller to feed the worms, and weren’t happy that I wouldn’t\ncommit more help to making that happen.”\nJuen was a pragmatic man and thought the odds of\nwhispering Jio’s name were low. The traitor kept guards\naround himself at all times and was so paranoid about\nassassination attempts that he rarely left his fortified residence.\nAs far as Juen was concerned, killing Jio was not a high\npriority for No Peak. It was more important to consolidate and\ndefend their existing holdings, and to tamp down the\nworrisome rise in activity from barukan gangs and anti-clan\nanarchists in Janloon.\nWhen he said this, Hilo agreed. “We’ve been supporting\nour allies in Lukang for long enough. Give them three months\nto decide whether they want to form their own minor tributary\nclan, or take oaths to No Peak.”\nJuen gave a nod and helped himself to a nut pastry. “As for\nthe anarchists, there’s still confusion over whether Green\nBones or the police should be in charge of dealing with them.”\nAnti-clan extremism was a low-level but persistent and\nspreading concern, like a stubborn fungal infection. Some\nmisdeeds by the so-called clanless were disorderly, such as\ndistributing pamphlets of their manifesto and spray-painting\ngraffiti on public property, but some were more serious.\nRecently, a jade setter’s shop had been set on fire, and\nalthough the shop was saved and the arsonists caught and\npunished, Juen pointed out the larger problem: “These\nextremists aren’t anything like a clan, or even a street gang.\nThey’re opportunistic and loosely organized, and their goal\nisn’t to control territory or businesses, or to steal jade or\nmoney. They just want to drum up discontent and create ugly\nattention so they can spread their poisonous ideas.”\nAnden said, with a confused frown, “There are always\nfanatics on the fringes of society. Why do there seem to be\nmore of them now, and why are they so much bolder?”\nWoon answered him. “Because now they can look to\noutsiders for sympathy and money. The Slow War has put\nKekon on the map and jade on everyone’s mind. There are\nforeign governments and organizations that encourage the\nanti-clan views.”\nHilo said to Juen, “I’ll come to the next meeting you have\nwith the chief of police. You’re right that we need to\ncoordinate better with the cops to find these lunatics and cut\nthem down.” He ate the last crispy squid ball and wiped his\nmouth with a napkin. “But first, we’ve got a bigger problem to\ndeal with.”"

It contained a stack of enlarged\nphotographs. They appeared to be aerial images, taken from a\nhelicopter, capturing sections of rocky shoreline and\nsurrounding ocean. A shape that appeared to be a ship was\ncircled with black marker. Additional photographs, taken with\ntelephoto lenses, showed the ship in greater detail—an\nindustrial vessel with an orange hull, its deck crammed with\nheavy equipment.\n“What is this?” Juen asked.\n“A prototype mining ship,” Hilo said. “Built by an\nEspenian company to dredge the ocean floor around Kekon for\njade.”\nJuen exclaimed, in incredulous outrage, “They can do that?\nIn Kekonese waters?”\nShae said, “It’s currently located twenty-five kilometers off\nthe coast of Euman Island. We were alerted to it by leaders of\nthe Abukei tribes who fish in the area. The Espenian Navy\ncontrols those waters—in fact, given the number of battleships\nthey have patrolling the Amaric, they control most of the\nwaters around Kekon.”\nAnden spoke up. “If the Espenian military is allowing this,\nshouldn’t it be an issue for the Royal Council to bring up with\nthe ROE government?”\n“They already have,” Woon replied. “It’s a diplomatic sore\npoint. Relations have already been strained for years over the\nexpansion of Euman Naval Base. Since the ROE wouldn’t\nbudge on the issue, the KJA reduced jade exports to Espenia.\nIt seems the ROE response to that is a typically Espenian one:\nsearch for someone else to buy from.”\n“An Espenian company willing to dig through the ocean\nfloor around Kekon,” Juen finished for him. “Will it work? Is\nthere actually any jade to find down there?”\nWen answered slowly, but clearly. “I spoke to several\ngeologists at Jan Royal University who think so. Rivers have\nbeen eroding the mountains of Kekon and carrying jade into\nthe surrounding ocean for millions of years. And there’s also\nrunoff from the mines being washed out to sea. The only\nquestion is whether it’s possible for anyone to profitably sift\nthrough all that water and gravel for enough tiny pebbles of\ngreen.”\n“Art Wyles, the CEO of Anorco Global Resources,\nobviously thinks so,” Shae said. “The Espenian tycoon has\ninvested hundreds of millions of thalirs into developing\nundersea mining technology. This ship is the first real test.\nWyles is also supposedly high up in the powerful Munitions\nSociety and has a lot of political connections.”\nWoon Papi, who seemed to be more outspoken since\nmarrying into the leadership of the Kaul family, grumbled, “If\nthere’s any time when the cost of such a foolish and arrogant\nventure might pay off, it would be now, with the price of jade\nso high.

There are reports that Ygutan has jade soldiers of their\nown, and the Espenians are desperate to stay ahead of their\nenemies. They’d like nothing more than to bypass the KJA\naltogether and have a reliable Espenian company mining jade\nfor them.”\nJuen put the photographs back into the folder. He’d noticed\nthat the Pillar had not said anything further, allowing the rest\nof the family to explain. Up until now, the issue had been a\npolitical one. Now that the Horn was involved, it was a\nmilitary one.\n“Hilo-jen,” Juen said, smiling with the excitement and\ntrepidation of being handled a truly unusual challenge, “this is\nnot going to be easy.”\n“I wouldn’t ask you if it was,” Hilo said. “I want that\nfucking ship destroyed.”\n_______\nA common misperception, even within the clan, Juen thought,\nwas that jade ability and martial prowess were the most\nimportant traits of a good Horn. Juen was without question an\naccomplished fighter, but he hardly considered it to be the\nmost important qualification for his job. Certainly not in this\nday and age, when as Horn, he had to manage thousands of\njade warriors deployed in different cities and even in different\ncountries. The clans had become too big to attack each other\ndirectly without mutual catastrophe, so they waged proxy wars\nvia tributaries and allies, criminal gangs, spies, politicians, and\njournalists, which further complicated Juen’s responsibilities.\nAfter Vuay had retired from the clan to take on a teaching\nposition at the Academy, Juen had split the role of First Fist\ninto three equal positions, all reporting directly to him—one to\noversee Janloon, one for the rest of Kekon, and one dedicated\nto the management of White Rats. He’d folded Maik Tar’s\nformer Nails into this latter branch, and focused on\nmodernizing its operations and planting informers among the\nbarukan in Kekon and Shotar and the Uwiwa Islands with the\ngoal of gathering more intelligence on the Mountain’s\nactivities. Juen had to constantly manage difficult people and\nlimited resources and keep a thousand details organized in his\nmind. And now, he also had to deal with this foreign mining\nship.\nHe made a phone call to his enemy: Aben Sorogun, the\nHorn of the Mountain. Aben had become Horn after the\nretirement of Nau Suenzen four years ago. Juen had only seen\nthe man in person a few times at public events, although he\npossessed a great deal more information gathered by No Peak\nspies. “Aben-jen,” Juen said when he reached the other Horn,\n“I assume you know about that Espenian company’s ship off\nEuman Island that’s an affront to all Green Bones. My Pillar\nwants it gone, and I suspect yours does as well. My name isn’t\nKaul, and yours isn’t Ayt, so personally, I don’t see why we\nshouldn’t work together on this, even if nothing else changes\nbetween our clans.”\nAben agreed, which was good news because Juen’s plan\nwas rather expensive, and might’ve raised attention from the\nMountain unless they were involved.

        "text": "between our clans.”\nAben agreed, which was good news because Juen’s plan\nwas rather expensive, and might’ve raised attention from the\nMountain unless they were involved. Six weeks after meeting\nwith the Kauls in the Twice Lucky, Juen was standing on a\nbeach in the middle of the night with two rigid inflatable\nboats, sourced from navy surplus thanks to No Peak’s\nconnections in the national military. Eight Green Bones—four\nfrom No Peak, four from the Mountain—were outfitted in\ndiving gear. There were plenty of strong swimmers among the\nclan’s Fists and Fingers, but not many with actual diving\nexperience. Standing in one of the boats, Aben Soro\ncommented wryly, “I don’t know about Kaul Du Academy, but\nmarine sabotage wasn’t taught at Wie Lon Temple School.\nMaybe I should talk to the grandmaster.”\nIn person, Aben was surprisingly amicable, not anything\nlike the grizzled veteran Nau Suen or the calmly brutal Gont\nAsch. Perhaps Ayt Mada had decided the Mountain needed a\nyounger, more likable face in the clan’s leadership. Aben wore\nhis jade as a heavy green chain around his neck and seemed\nlike the sort of man who watched sports and owned large dogs,\nwho could be friendly with everyone but exuded a down-to-\nearth toughness that was not to be fucked with. They were\nboth acting pleasant and cooperating in this one manner, but\nJuen was not about to forget that elsewhere—in Lukang, and\nacross the ocean in Resville—their respective forces were\nbusy trying to destroy each other, and it was entirely possible\nthat under different circumstances, one of them would kill the\nother.\nTonight, however, they shared an objective. Instead of\nlaunching from Euman Island, where they might be spotted by\nthe Espenian military, they’d chosen the upper part of Kekon’s\nmain cove, a twohour drive north from Janloon on a deserted\nstretch of shoreline. This far from the city, there was no light\npollution and the clear sky was ink black and strewn with\nstars. The Green Bones in the two boats sped toward the\nforeign mining ship, bouncing rhythmically across gentle\nswells for ninety minutes before coming up on either side of\nthe slow-moving vessel under cover of darkness.\nJuen had found out everything he could about the ship\nbeforehand. It was still being tested and not yet fully\noperational, so only a small crew was in place. Remote-\ncontrolled machines were sent to gather samples from the\nseafloor, which were evaluated for potential jade\nconcentrations before an expensive, specialized crawler was\ndeployed to dredge the area. The crawler was connected to the\nship by an enormous hose that sucked up sediment and\ntransported it to the equipment that extracted the gems. It was\nimpressive, cuttingedge technology. Juen had to grudgingly\nadmire the Espenians; when motivated by greed, they were\ntruly ingenious.\nThey cut the engines. Divers from both sides went\noverboard with quiet splashes. Working with the sort of speed\nonly Green Bones can muster, they magnetically attached\nlimpet mines to the underside of the ship. In the silently\nbobbing boat, Juen kept his Perception trained above, but he\ndidn’t sense alertness or alarm from any approaching crew"

In the silently\nbobbing boat, Juen kept his Perception trained above, but he\ndidn’t sense alertness or alarm from any approaching crew\nmembers. Every few minutes, he swung his Perception back\ntoward Aben, more out of instinctive caution around an enemy\nGreen Bone than any real fear of betrayal. They were out here\ntogether precisely so that neither side could take advantage.\nWithin thirty minutes, all the divers had returned to the\nboats and they were speeding back the way they had come.\nThey would be long gone when the timed charges went off.\nThe explosions would not be large enough to kill the people\nonboard—dead foreigners were best avoided—but they would\ndestroy the rudder, propellor, and crawler hose, and tear holes\ninto the ship’s hull, hopefully damaging the equipment on\nboard as well.\nIdeally, that would be the end of the Anorco corporation’s\nexpensive foray into jade mining, but Juen thought it likely the\nship would be repaired and they would have to destroy it\nagain, perhaps several times before the venture was written off\nas too costly. The Espenians were sure to complain angrily to\nthe Royal Council about the damage to private property, and\nthe Kekonese government would smugly and rightfully deny\nany knowledge or involvement in the sabotage. Without\nanother source of jade, and with Kekon still the linchpin of the\nROE’s regional defense strategy against Ygutan, complaining\nwas all the foreigners could do.\nWhen they returned to shore, Juen’s face was stinging and\nhis ears were sore from the hours of sea spray and wind. He\njumped out of the boat and helped drag it onto shore, working\nquickly with his men to pile the boats and equipment onto a\nwaiting trailer truck that would transport them into storage. It\nwas still dark, but the sun would come up in a couple of hours,\nand they had to return to Janloon. Aben and his men worked\nefficiently alongside them. After the gear was loaded and the\ntruck had driven away, the No Peak and Mountain Green\nBones climbed into their separate vehicles, though not before\nchecking for car bombs the other side might’ve planted.\n“Juen-jen,” Aben Soro said, touching his forehead.\n“Aben-jen,” Juen replied, returning the gesture. He got into\nthe front of his Roewolfe G8 and sped with his Fists back to\nthe city. When the sun rose, he and Aben Soro would be\nenemies as usual, and he had to get to work.\nCHAPTER\n18\nCatfish\nB\nero met his handlers every six to eight weeks, in different\npublic places that he didn’t usually frequent and where they\nwouldn’t be overheard. Two days beforehand, he would get a\nnote slipped under his apartment door with the date, place, and\ntime of the meeting. He felt like a secret agent in a spy movie,\nexcept that it was not as glamorous as he’d hoped. He did not,\nfor example, get a gun, or a secret phone, or a cyanide capsule\nwith which to kill himself if he was ever caught by the\nYgutanians. He did get a code name: Catfish.

He hadn’t been given\nany choice in the matter, however. He always spoke only with\nGalo, the Keko-Espenian man, while Galo’s partner, Berglund,\nkept watch by walking around nearby, disguised as a foreign\ntourist.\n“Do you have any specific details about what they’re\nplanning?” Galo pressed him again today, as they walked\naround the nearly empty art museum. Bero had never been in\nan art museum before. He pretended to study a display of\nindigenous Abukei pottery while speaking to Galo.\n“They keep talking about doing something big, striking a\nblow, making a statement, vague shit like that,” Bero said,\nfrustrated more at Galo’s incessant prodding than by his failure\nto garner detailed information about Vastik eya Molovni’s\ninvolvement with the Clanless Future Movement.\nThe clanless had grown. That much, Bero could tell them\nfor certain. There were more people at the meetings, more\npeople daring to stand up to the clans. Guriho’s speeches were\ngetting so exuberant that sometimes Bero thought the man\nwould begin frothing at the mouth or give himself an\naneurysm. They had momentum now, Guriho said. The people\nwere ready to defy the corrupt and oppressive forces of\ngovernment, religion, and capitalism that had fettered them\nwith the manacles of clannism. Or something like that. Bero\ncouldn’t remember all the man’s flowery words.\n“Guriho keeps saying that soon the moment will come for\nus to rise up in the streets and fight,” Bero grumbled to his\nhandler, “but it’s not like he tells us exactly what that\nmoment’s going to look like or when it’s going to be.”\n“Have you had any success getting closer to the leaders?”\nGalo demanded.\n“I’ve tried, keke,” Bero retorted, even though Galo was\nnot a keke at all. “It’s the four of them—Molovni, Guriho,\nOtonyo, and that girl, Ema. They don’t bring anyone else in.”\nGalo moved away from the glass case of Abukei pottery\ntoward a wall of Deitist religious iconography, expecting Bero\nto stay with him. In the corner of the room, Berglund stowed\nthe museum brochure he’d been pretending to read and\nfollowed after them at a distance. “We know the background\nof the three men, but this woman, Ema, what’s her story?”\nGalo asked. “She’s not Ygutanian, or barukan, or anyone with\na political motive, as far as you’ve told us. What makes her\none of the group’s leaders?”\nBero scowled, because he didn’t understand it either. For\nsome reason, the woman had been admitted into Molovni’s\ninner circle, when Bero had not. She must be letting them fuck\nher. It was the only explanation.\n“I already told you what I know,” Bero grumbled. “She\nworks as a secretary somewhere downtown. She’s spent time"

Her family has a business, or they used to. I\nthink it went under. That’s why she has a grudge against the\nclans, because they ruined her family, she says.”\nShortly after he’d begun working for the Espenians, Bero\nhad succeeded in convincing Ema to go to a bar and have a\ndrink with him. They stayed out for a couple of hours. She was\nnice to look at, and she even laughed at some of his jokes. She\nseemed like a lonely person without friends. Bero told her the\nstory of how he’d gotten his crooked face, from being caught\nand beaten by the Maik brothers when he was sixteen years\nold. Of course, he had even bigger stories to tell, but he\nthought he would save them for later, since she might not\nbelieve them. To Bero’s disappointment, Ema was not as awed\nas he’d expected she would be. Worst of all, when he\nsuggested they go back to his place, she said she had to work\nthe next morning and gave him only a kiss on the cheek.\nSince then, he’d managed to coax her out for drinks a few\nother times, and once, they went to see a late-night horror\nmovie. He wasn’t able to get any further on those occasions\neither, nor learn anything useful about her to satisfy the\nEspenians.\nOne evening, Bero waited in an alley outside of the Little\nPersimmon, hoping to catch her alone as she walked back to\nthe subway, or follow her to where she lived. When twenty\nminutes passed and she still hadn’t emerged, he went back up\nthe stairs to the lounge. The room appeared to be empty but he\ncould hear voices. When he walked behind the bar, he\ndiscovered a small room—perhaps an ample storage closet, or\na space where musicians and performers could retreat between\nsets, or simply an eccentric secret area. Instead of a door, the\nentryway was covered by a hanging purple curtain, but it was\nnot drawn all the way across, and through a gap, Bero could\nsee Molovni, Guriho, Otonyo, and Ema talking in low voices,\nstanding around large pieces of paper spread out on a table.\nPerhaps the stories about the nekolva having jade abilities\nwere true because Molovni turned around and flung the curtain\nopen. Bero leapt backward at the man’s ferocious glower.\n“What’re you doing back here?” the Ygutanian demanded.\n“Meeting’s over.”\n“I think I dropped my keys near the bar earlier,” Bero lied\nquickly. “Anyone seen them?” He made a show of looking\naround the bar and the bench where he’d been sitting. Ema\nrolled up the papers on the table, but not before Bero glimpsed\na map of Janloon and handdrawn building blueprints. Guriho\ncame over to help Bero look. Molovni’s hooded eyes followed\nBero with suspicion.\n“None of us have seen your keys,” Ema said. “We’ll let\nyou know if they turn up.”\nBero pretended to be disappointed, then said, “So, what"

It seemed Molovni and the others had\nmoved their private meetings to some other time and location.\nBero couldn’t figure out why they didn’t trust him.

It was\npossible they simply didn’t like him.\nFor a while, Bero was stuck providing the Espenians with\nwhatever information he could glean from the general\nmeetings, such as how many people showed up each week,\nwhich ones Molovni talked to, how the clanless were\nrecruiting and fundraising. Eventually, by dint of his regular\nattendance and persistent interest, he managed to become the\nsecretary of the Clanless Future Movement, which meant that\nfor the past year, he’d been responsible for recording\nattendance at the meetings, taking and keeping notes of the\nhappenings, and maintaining all the secret membership lists. It\nwas easy enough to make copies of all these documents and\npass them along to Galo and Berglund on a regular basis. This\nsteady stream of mundane but detailed information had been\nenough to keep the ROE military intelligence goons sated, and\nBero’s paychecks flowing, which was the most important\nthing.\nStill, Galo and Berglund wanted more. They suspected the\nYgutanians were supporting the aspiring Kekonese\nrevolutionaries with money, guns, and other resources, and\nthey wanted hard proof. They wanted a breakthrough.\nFrom the other side of the exhibit room, Berglund caught\nhis partner’s eye and made a surreptitious gesture to finish up\nthe conversation.\nGalo turned back to Bero. “If this Ema woman has\ninfluence with Molovni, she could bring you in. Try to get\nclose to her again.”\nBero sneered at how easy Galo made it sound. “I’d like to,\nbelieve me.”\nGalo glanced at Bero with undisguised irritation. “You\nshould try to become her friend, get to know her, not just get\nunder her skirt. Where exactly does she work? Does she have\nties to Ygutanian interests? Details. This is of national\nimportance.”\nThe Espenians had emphasized on several occasions that\nYgutan wanted to encourage, manipulate, and take advantage"

        "text": "ties to Ygutanian interests? Details. This is of national\nimportance.”\nThe Espenians had emphasized on several occasions that\nYgutan wanted to encourage, manipulate, and take advantage\nof the nascent but growing anti-clan social movement in order\nto create political instability in Kekon. If the clans were\nthrown out of power, then jade would flood the market.\nYgutan and its allies could acquire it more easily, instead of\ndepending on illegal contracts and stingy black market\nmiddlemen. Civil unrest in Kekon might lead to a more pro-\nYgutanian regime and a renegotiation of existing jade export\ncontracts with the Republic of Espenia.\nThat was unacceptable, for Galo and Berglund and all their\nsuperiors in Adamont Capita. They did not want anything to\nthreaten their country’s advantage in Kekon.\n“Yeah, yeah, I hear you,” Bero muttered. “I’m working on\nit.”\nGalo handed Bero the usual paper envelope of cash. Bero\nreached to take it, but the handler held on to it, giving Bero a\nlong stare of almost paternal concern. “We’ve been investing\nin you for years, Catfish. We’ve paid you more than you could\never have made in your sorry life. Remember that this money\nruns out at the same time our patience does. The Espenian\nmilitary protects our assets—but only the ones we consider\nvaluable.”\nGalo let go of the envelope and left the gallery. Two\nminutes later, Berglund got up from the bench in the corner\nand followed, leaving Bero alone to curse everyone, himself\nincluded.\nCHAPTER\n19\nSmiles and Words\nthe thirteenth year, eleventh month\nW\nen stood in front of the full-length mirror in the bedroom\nand examined herself. She’d chosen a forest-green designer\ndress, patterned with a subtle traditional print but cut in a\nflattering modern silhouette. She complemented it with\ndangling gold leaf-shaped earrings and dressy gold flats—any\nsort of heel made her too anxious about falling. She debated\nwhether to wear her hair up or down before deciding to pull it\naway from her face in a fan-shaped clasp but to keep it down\nfor a more informal appearance befitting a daytime event. She\nrehearsed her speech once more, taking the time to pause and\ncarefully enunciate any words that she feared might trip her up\nand cause her to stammer when she was in front of a\nmicrophone. As a stone-eye and the wife of the Pillar, she’d\nlong ago developed resilience against the negative opinions of\nothers. She was accustomed to being judged for her physical\nappearance and her inherited deficiencies, so nothing anyone\ncould say on those aspects worried her, but she was terrified of\nbeing regarded as a feeble Pillarman.\nThe Pillarman was not traditionally a visible role and did\nnot ordinarily draw much interest from inside or outside the\nclan. However, Kaul Hilo appointing his stone-eye wife into\nthe position formerly held by one of his closest and most\nfeared warriors was unusual enough to have caused\nconsiderable comment. Some people viewed it as a shift in No\nPeak, a sign that the Pillar was stepping back from personal\ninvolvement in the military side of the clan by consolidating it\nback under the Horn and placing a non–Green Bone in the role"

More callous remarks suggested Kaul Hilo\nsimply needed a Maik at his side at all times and was down to\nhis last one.\nSix years had passed since Tar had been exiled. Wen\ngrieved for her brother as if he were dead, which he might as\nwell be, as he could never return or contact anyone in the clan\nagain. Whenever she visited Kehn’s gravesite in Widow’s\nPark, she brought two baskets of flowers and fruit and asked\nthe gods to recognize both of her brothers. She knew that Tar\nwas in Port Massy, closely watched by clan allies who’d been\ninstructed not to interfere with or harm him, but to kill him if\nhe violated any of the rules laid upon him.\nEvery few months, she wrote letters to Tar, telling him\nnews about the family and how his nephews and niece were\ndoing. She did not hide this from Hilo, and he did not stop her,\nbecause Tar knew better than to ever write back. That was how\nWen knew her lengthy messages were meaningful to him, a\nman who was a ghost; he never once risked losing them.\nWen put the cue cards containing her written speech into a\nsequined clutch and went down to the kitchen. Ru came\ndownstairs in his school uniform. He threw the ball for Koko,\nthen fed the yellow dog before sitting down and gobbling the\nbreakfast of eggs and hot cereal that Wen set in front of him.\n“Can I go to my friend Tian’s house after school today?” he\nasked.\n“I won’t be able to pick you up,” Wen told him.\n“I can walk to Uncle Anden’s apartment and he can drive\nme home later.”\n“How far of a walk is it? Where does Tian live?”\n“In the Commons.” When Wen gave him a stern look, the\ntwelveyear-old groaned dramatically. “Ma, his apartment is\ntwo blocks away from Old Town.”\n“It’s still in Mountain territory.”\n“We’re not at war with them,” Ru protested.\n“We’re always at war with them, even when you don’t see\nit.”\n“Ma!” When Ru was angry, color came into his face, and\nhe looked even more like Hilo. “No one else in my class has\nparents who make a big deal out of walking two blocks in an\n‘enemy’ district.”\n“No one else in your class is a Kaul.” Wen was starting to\nfeel exasperated herself. “It’s not just the Mountain. There are\nplenty of other bad people out there.”\n“In the Commons?” Ru exclaimed. “It’s not like I’ll be\nwandering alone at night in Dog’s Head!”\n“Still, our Fists and Fingers won’t be nearby, and you can’t\nwalk into a store and expect there to be a No Peak Lantern\nMan who’ll help you if you need help.”\nHilo came in through the patio door. Ru wheeled on his\nfather. “Da, can I go to Tian’s house after school? It’s two\nblocks into the Commons, and Ma is being paranoid about it.\nPlease, Da!”\nHilo looked from his son to Wen. She sighed and shrugged"

She sighed and shrugged\nin defeat. “Have your talon knife on you,” Hilo said. “And\nphone your uncle’s apartment before you leave, tell him when\nto expect you.”\n“I will, I promise,” Ru exclaimed, instantly cheerful. He\ngrabbed his school bag, bent to rub Koko’s head, then ran out\nthe front door toward the driveway, where Shae or Woon\nwould pick him up and drive him to school on their way to the\noffice. Koko ran out the door after his master, wagging his tail\nand whining at being left behind. Wen was not especially fond\nof the creature, who occasionally chewed her shoes or the\nfurniture, but he’d been Hilo’s gift to Ru when the boy was\nten, on the day he would’ve begun training at Kaul Du\nAcademy, if he hadn’t been born a stone-eye.\nHilo sat down at the table. “He has to have some freedom,\nso he feels capable.”\nWen said, “I know. But we don’t know his friends or their\nfamilies that well.” Niko’s and Jaya’s classmates were from\nNo Peak clan families; it was easy for Wen to pick up the\nphone and speak to their parents. Ru went to one of the best\nschools in the city, but it wasn’t the Academy. Tian’s father\nwas a civil engineer and his mother stayed at home; they had\nno clan affiliation at all. They seemed like good people, and\nWen’s few interactions with them had been friendly, but it\nwasn’t the same.\nAt times, when she missed Niko and Jaya, Wen was\ngrateful that one of her children still lived at home, but at other\ntimes, his presence was a daily reminder of her own\nexperience as a child, an outsider even in her own family.\nAs if sensing her concern, Hilo reminded her, “Things will\nbe different for Ru than they were for you. People aren’t as\nsuperstitious as they used to be, and besides, he has your\nexample to look up to.” He was looking at her the entire time\nas he stirred chives into a bowl of hot cereal. “Why are you so\ndressed up today?”\n“I’m going to a charity luncheon,” Wen said. “It’s in\nsupport of the Kekon Parks & Nature Foundation.”\nA skeptical crease formed on Hilo’s forehead. “What do\nyou need to go to that for? Didn’t you go to something similar\na couple of weeks ago?”\n“That was for the Janloon Small Business Council.” Wen\nopened a black schedule book. “Going to all these events\nwouldn’t be a good use of the Pillar’s time. But someone from\nNo Peak should go to them. Someone who can speak for the\nclan.”\n“We could send Woon.”\nWen raised an eyebrow at him. “Woon might be the best\nperson in the clan to give press conferences, but can you\nimagine him making small talk at a gala for the arts?” The\nPillarman smiled and shook her head. “We shouldn’t pass up\nthese chances to show that No Peak stands for ordinary people\nand not just jade warriors.

Especially now, with the extremists\nidealizing foreign ways and brainwashing people into thinking\nKekon can do away with clans altogether.”\nHilo gave her his lopsided smile. “I’ll tell Juen that our\nnew weapon against the clanless will be garden parties.”\n“Be serious,” Wen said. “This is important.”\nHilo finished his breakfast, then picked up the empty\nbowls on the table and put them into the sink, running the\nwater to rinse them off. Kyanla was partly retired now, but she\nwould come in later in the day to tidy up and make dinner.\nWen could see Hilo considering what she’d said, frowning as\nhe dried his hands on a towel. “You’re probably right that\ngoing to these events and showing a good face to the public is\nworthwhile, but I still don’t see why it should be you. That’s\nnot the Pillarman’s job.”\nWen got up and wrapped her arms around his waist from\nbehind. “The Pillarman’s job is whatever the Pillar says it is,”\nshe argued with sweet forcefulness. “And besides, I’m not\nonly the Pillarman, I’m your wife. Let me get dressed up and\nmeet people and enjoy my place a little. It might even be\nuseful to us. Didn’t you just say a person needs some freedom\nto feel capable?”\nHilo sighed and turned around, putting his arms around her\nand touching his lips to her forehead. She knew that even after\nmaking her his Pillarman, he struggled with his instinct to\nshield her. He wanted to trust her as he once did, but\nsometimes his questions were sharp and suspicious. Wen tried\nher best not to resent him for it, and to consciously shake the\nengrained habit of omitting information about her activities\nwhen they might meet with his disapproval. She could not win\nback his confidence all at once; trust that had been so\ndramatically spilled could only be refilled one drop at a time.\nWen propped the open schedule book against her\nhusband’s chest. She’d gone from a stealthy involvement in\nclan affairs to facing them daily as a complex, shifting\narrangement of color-coded appointments and tasks. “Don’t\nforget your meeting with General Ronu was moved to this\nafternoon. It’s to review the report he’ll be making to the\nRoyal Council next week. Your sister phoned this morning and\nsaid she’s not feeling well, so if she isn’t able to be there,\nWoon will attend in her place.”\nHilo’s eyebrows rose. “Again? That’s the third meeting\nshe’s missed this month. It’s not like Shae to leave me alone in\nmeetings when she thinks some random fact might come up\nthat she knows more about than I do.”\nWen fought hard against a smile. “Maybe you should ask\nher why she’s feeling so unwell lately when no one else in the\nfamily’s been sick.”\n“I suppose I should,” Hilo said, so obliviously that Wen\nhad to turn away and clap a hand over her mouth to stifle a\nlaugh. Hilo’s eyes narrowed with dawning realization. “No\nfucking way.” When Wen smiled and shrugged as if she knew\nnothing, he burst into laughter. “Good for them. I didn’t think"

I didn’t think\nShae was the type, but it’s just like her to wait too long and\ncome around in the end.”\n“I didn’t tell you anything,” Wen declared. “Be nice to\nyour sister and let her tell everyone herself when she’s ready.”\nShe moved her finger down to the next note. “The Espenian\nambassador called again about the destruction of the Anorco\nmining ship. I referred him back to Woon Papi.”\nHilo snorted, then tugged the schedule book out of her\nhands. “Good. Woon can ignore him on the clan’s behalf,\nthat’s his job as Sealgiver.” He laid the book down on the\nkitchen counter. “Do you remember back when you used to lie\nin bed stretched out naked in the morning, tempting me away\nfrom clan business? Now clan business is all you want to talk\nabout.”\nWen tilted her chin as she looked up at her husband slyly.\n“Would you rather I neglected my duties as Pillarman?”\nHilo took her by the shoulders and turned her away from\nhim. His lips moved near her ear from behind, warming the\nskin of her neck. “There are other ways to help your Pillar\nprepare for the day.” He slid a hand down the front of her\ndress and squeezed her left breast. “I have half an hour in my\nschedule right now—it says so in your book. And you look so\nnice today, dressed up for other people and not even for me.”\nWen braced against the kitchen table as he bent her over.\nHilo lifted the dress over her hips and pulled down her panties.\nHe nudged her legs apart with his knees before disappearing\nfrom view behind her. She felt him seize her inner thighs,\nspreading her wide open. Then the wet heat of his mouth. Wen\nshivered and rose onto her toes, lifting one leg to better\naccommodate him as he stood, unzipped his pants and plunged\ndeeply into her with one smooth motion. She smiled as she\nbore down rhythmically on his thrusts. They were not young\nanymore, but Hilo was still impulsive by nature and there were\nundeniable advantages to having the house to themselves more\nfrequently these days.\n_______\nAn hour later, her dress back in place and the inside of her\nthighs wiped down, Wen checked her makeup in a hand\nmirror. The driver opened the car door, and Wen stepped out of\nher Lumezza 6C convertible and walked through the entrance\nof Wie Lon Temple School.\nShe considered the hypocrisy of being concerned about her\nson visiting a friend two blocks inside a Mountain-controlled\ndistrict while she strode straight into the heart of enemy\nterritory. Wie Lon was the oldest martial school in the country,\nthe Mountain’s feeder school, the alma mater of Ayt Madashi\nand nearly every high-ranking Green Bone in that clan. Its\nspacious and imposing main training hall was also\noccasionally rented out for large private functions such as this\none. Wen took in her surroundings with curiosity.

Unlike Kaul\nDushuron Academy, which was situated within Janloon, Wie\nLon was a forty-five minute drive west of the city and had the\nfeel of a secluded forest camp. A fitting place to put important\npatrons in the mood for supporting nature conservation.\nWen’s personal bodyguards flanked her closely as she\napproached the entrance to the hall. Hilo no longer permitted\nher off the Kaul estate without security. Wen did not object.\nDudo and Tako were both former Fists, good men, polite,\nunobtrusive enough unless obtrusiveness was called for. Wen\nhad come to find their presence reassuring, a reminder that she\nwas never helpless, that she had the weight of her husband and\nthe clan he ruled behind her. She wasn’t sure she would’ve had\nthe confidence to step back into public life otherwise. And\nthey were helpful to her in other ways. When she reached the\nfront steps to the hall, Dudo handed Wen her cane, which she\nused to steady herself as she navigated the half dozen shallow\nsteps to the door. She tried her best not to be seen hobbling,\nbut falling would be even more painful and humiliating. When\nshe reached the top step, she handed the cane back to Dudo,\nlifted her chin to gather her confidence again, and stepped\nthrough the main doors.\nSoft natural sunlight bathed the hall from high windows.\nThe wooden floor where Green Bone students trained was\nfilled with round tables covered in green tablecloths and\ndecorated with miniature rock garden centerpieces. Wen made\nher way to the head table at the front of the hall, stopping here\nand there to greet people—prominent Lantern Men of No\nPeak, the longtime KNB news anchor Toh Kita, a couple of\nsitting members of the Royal Council. She no longer\npossessed the nearly flawless memory she’d once been able to\nrely on. She had to make lists of names and use memory tricks\nto help her recollection in advance of situations like this.\nWhen she reached the circular head table, she was greeted\nby the chairman of the Kekon Parks & Nature Foundation.\n“Mrs. Kaul,” he said, “you honor us with your willingness to\nattend and say a few words on behalf of the clan. I know it’ll\nmake a big difference to our donors, to hear that the Pillar of\nNo Peak supports the preservation of our country’s natural\nspaces.”\nWen doubted that Hilo had given much thought to the\nissue, if any at all, but she assured the chairman that it was her\npleasure to be here to convey her husband’s sentiments. Wen\ntook her seat as the final two guests arrived at the head table.\nWen recognized the middle-aged man at once. Koben Yiro,\none of the most prominent and outspoken Green Bones in the\nMountain clan, head of the sprawling Koben family and uncle\nto Ayt Ato. The heavyset woman with permed hair must be his\nwife.\n“Mrs. Kaul,” Koben Tin Bett exclaimed, smiling widely\nand seating herself next to Wen. She hung the oversized\nhandbag she carried over the back of her chair. “What a\ndelight to see you here. And looking so much healthier than I\nthought you would.” She tugged on her husband’s hand. “Sit"

Ayt Mada seemed perfectly willing to let Koben\nshine in his own spotlight. Ayt was a polished orator and a\nfearsome Green Bone leader, but Koben Yiro was brash and\nrelatable to ordinary Kekonese, making himself out to be\neveryone’s opinionated but well-meaning uncle.\n“Koben-jen,” Wen said with a polite smile. “Mrs. Koben.”\n“Bett is fine,” said the woman. She patted Wen’s hand.\n“We wives needn’t be standoffish with each other.”\nA photographer from the Janloon Daily asked to take a\nphotograph of the head table, with Wen and the Kobens in the\nforeground. Wen smiled for the camera. She could already\nimagine the headline in the Notable People section: Mountain\nand No Peak Clans Face Off Over Lunch in Support of Nature\nConservation.\n“Are you here on your own?” Mrs. Koben asked Wen,\nplucked eyebrows arched in admiration and mild concern.\n“How courageous of you. Not that anyone would be low\nenough to tug their earlobes at a classy event like this, surely.”\nShe took out a hand-sanitizing wipe from her purse and\ncleaned her fingers before the meal, then put on reading\nglasses to study the luncheon’s program while continuing to\ntalk to Wen. “Of course, I can understand wanting to get away\nand enjoy yourself now that you’ve done your part for the clan\nand your children are a bit older. I hear your nephew—Niko, is\nit?—is doing quite well at the Academy. And you have a\ndaughter who’s normal and is there now as well, don’t you?”\n“Mrs. Koben, I’m embarrassed to admit you know more\nabout my family than I do about yours.” Wen gave the woman\nher sweetest smile. “Except for your nephew, of course, even\nthough he doesn’t have the Koben name anymore. Changing\nthe boy’s name to Ayt Ato was a clever way to elevate him.”\n“My nephew is twenty-one years old and a Fist, so hardly\na boy anymore,” Mrs. Koben reminded her.\n“Twenty-one already? I thought he was younger. Perhaps\nthat’s because I heard he fought his first duel earlier this year.\nMy husband and brothers were in their teens when they first\nstarted winning green for themselves, so I admit my\nbenchmark is different.” Wen shrugged and unfolded her\nnapkin.

When she was especially nervous or under stress, she\nwas more likely to start stammering or losing the ability to\nfind words, but she’d overcome far too much in life for\nsomeone like Mrs. Koben to intimidate her.\n“Greenness has many aspects, of course,” said Mrs. Koben\nwith a maternally scolding tone. “A jadeless woman wouldn’t\nbe able to speak about it.”\n“Don’t be so humble,” Wen insisted. “Men need the help\nof their women. You’re obviously a very involved wife and\naunt and deserve as much credit as your husband for the\nKoben family’s reputation.”\nThe woman’s eyes twitched, the look of an animal\ndiscovering it has bitten into a meal with spines. Fortunately,\nat that moment, the food arrived, and Koben Bett took the\nopportunity to turn back to her husband.\nJadeless women—we have so few weapons, Wen thought,\nwith vicious self-satisfaction. We duel each other with smiles\nand words the way our men duel with knives.\nShe tried to enjoy the meal but couldn’t bring herself to eat\nmuch. She was thinking of the speech she would soon have to\ngive and imagining faltering and humiliating herself in front of\neveryone, including the smug Kobens. She turned to the guest\nseated on her other side and was surprised to see an Abukei\nman. He introduced himself with a Kekonese family name and\nan Abukei personal name, as Ren Jirhuya. He was young and\nhandsome, in his early thirties, Wen guessed.\n“What’s your connection to the Parks & Nature\nFoundation, Mr. Ren?” she asked.\n“I was named a cultural ambassador for the Yinao tribe.”\nThe man hesitated, then added, “And I’m an artist. I did all the\nartwork for the fundraising campaign and also the animation in\nthe short film they’re going to play after lunch. And please call\nme Jirhuya—it’s what I’m more comfortable going by.”\nWen admired the art on the posters and the programs, the\ndesigner in her appreciating the balance of color and the\nexpressive modern style applied to indigenous motifs and\nthemes. “Do you do much of this kind of work?”\n“Whatever I can get,” he admitted. “I work mostly in the\nfilm industry.”\nWen noticed with fascination that Jirhuya was wearing a\nplain green gemstone ring on his right forefinger. Wearing\nbluffer’s jade was considered gaudy and low-class in Kekon, a\nstyle associated with Keko-Shotarian gangsters. Jirhuya could\nnot be barukan, and nothing else about him seemed cheap or\ncareless. His pale blue linen suit was perfectly pressed and\nwell tailored to his slight frame, a spot of color amid the\nindistinguishable dark outfits of the other men. His crinkly\nhair was short and well groomed, and his speech had none of\nthe rolling lilt of an indigenous accent.\n“I couldn’t help but wonder about the ring you’re\nwearing,” Wen said. “Does it signify anything?”\nRen blushed a little. “It’s an Abukei tradition. Adults wear\na ring on the thumb if they’re married or otherwise committed\nto someone, on the forefinger if they’re single and open to a"

Adults wear\na ring on the thumb if they’re married or otherwise committed\nto someone, on the forefinger if they’re single and open to a\nrelationship, and on the little finger if they’re not looking.” It\nwas Wen’s turn to be embarrassed. She’d learned that fact at\nsome point, perhaps from Kyanla, who wore a silver band\naround her right little finger, but she’d forgotten. She’d been\ncurious because of the substance of the ring, not its position.\nJirhuya said, “Centuries ago, rings like this used to be\nmade of jade, because of its sacred connection to the body of\nthe First Mother goddess, Nimuma. That stopped a long time\nago, for obvious reasons.” Anyone who wore jade without\nbeing able to use jade abilities would be too easy a target for\nthieves. Certainly no Abukei or stone-eye would wear it unless\nthey wished to court disaster or be accused of smuggling.\nJirhuya turned the ring on his finger. “Wearing a green ring is\na nod to ancient custom, and bluffer’s jade is easier to obtain\nnow that there’s an overseas demand for it.”\nServers cleared the plates away, a short film was played,\nand the chairman of the foundation stood up to thank all the\nguests and exhort them to give their financial and political\nbacking to conservation efforts. He expressed particular thanks\nfor the support of the country’s Green Bone clans and invited\nWen to make a few remarks.\nWen rose and walked to the podium, trying to make her\ngradual approach appear deliberate instead of physically\ncautious. Her hands were sweating. When she reached the\nmicrophone, she took a moment to look out across the\ngathered and attentive faces. Then she began speaking, as\nslowly as she had practiced, pretending that she was relating a\nfamily story to friends rather than delivering an address to\nstrangers, so that her words would come out clearly and\nnaturally, without stutters and lapses.\nShe began by telling an amusing anecdote about Hilo\ntaking her into the mountains on a day trip many years ago and\ngetting them hopelessly lost. At the time, he’d been the Horn\nof No Peak and knew the city of Janloon like a guard dog\nknows every rock and blade of grass in its yard, but he had\nless sense of direction in the wilderness. The audience laughed\nat the idea of the fearsome Kaul Hiloshudon trudging\nstubbornly through the forest in the wrong direction. Wen\nsavored a warm rush of triumph. She imagined that Hilo\nwould not appreciate her recounting the embarrassing event to\na banquet of prominent Janloon society members, but he was\nnot here to be annoyed. She alone was in the unique position\nto share the relatable, human side of the family, to show that\nthe Kauls were powerful people, but still people.\n“As our country’s economy grows, as our cities expand\nand our factories multiply, we must balance our drive toward\nprosperity with prudence. Many would say that jade is\nKekon’s most valuable natural resource. Yet jade can only be\nused by a few people, while the natural beauty of our island\nbelongs to us all, regardless of wealth, clan, blood, or ability."

Yet jade can only be\nused by a few people, while the natural beauty of our island\nbelongs to us all, regardless of wealth, clan, blood, or ability.\nAnd so it’s up to all of us to protect it as fiercely as we protect\nour families and our values.” Wen returned to her seat at the\ntable amid sustained applause, pleased and relieved to have\ngotten through it.\nJirhuya leaned in. “That was beautifully delivered, Mrs.\nKaul,” he said. “Would you be willing to speak at the\nCharitable Society for Jade Nonreactivity sometime? I\nvolunteer for the organization and I know the members on the\nboard. Having someone so prominent in the No Peak clan talk\nopenly about being a stone-eye would go a long way toward\ndestigmatizing nonreactivity. Would you consider it?”\n“I would be pleased to do so, if my schedule allows,” Wen\ntold him.\nBefore they could continue the conversation, the chairman\nof the foundation returned to the podium and invited Koben\nYiro to make a few remarks on behalf of the Mountain clan.\nKoben stood up, rebuttoned his suit across his broad chest, and\nmade his way to the microphone. The audience fell silent and\nleaned forward.\n“For much of its history, Kekon was a civilization at\nharmony with its natural surroundings,” Koben began, in a\ndramatic, rumbling voice. “There’s no better example of that\nthan the great Wie Lon Temple School, where we gather today.\nUnfortunately, like so many other vital elements of Kekonese\nculture, those values are under attack.”\nKoben spoke about the long-term degradation of Kekon’s\nwilderness caused by decades of grasping colonial interests:\ndeforestation caused by jade mining for the purpose of\nfulfilling export contracts with the Republic of Espenia,\npollution by foreign companies, and the loss of five square\nkilometers of natural habitat on Euman Island as a result of the\nexpansion of the ROE naval base. “As I speak,” Koben\nboomed, stabbing a finger in the air as his resonant voice\nvibrated with passion, “an Espenian company is dredging our\ncoastal regions for jade. Brave patriots destroyed the first\nmining ship, but Espenian greed knows no bounds, and\nanother was sent to steal jade from the ocean—and, in the\nprocess, ruin traditional indigenous fishing regions and destroy\nirreplaceable natural habitats.\n“We can’t solve environmental damage until we talk about\ntheir primary cause: foreigners,” Koben proclaimed. “It’s time\nwe turn away from the destructive path we’ve been on for\ndecades—time to stop bowing to foreign corporations,\nspending precious resources on refugees, and letting jade leave\nour shores.” Some people in the audience tapped the table in\npolite applause; others stamped their feet and called out in\nvehement agreement. Koben, buoyed by the response, shook\nhis fist in the air and concluded with conviction. “Together, we\nmust root out foreign exploitation in all forms! Only then can\nwe protect our beautiful island home.”\nWen felt a flush rising up her neck. To her horror, her\nhands began to tremble.

She’d devoted careful\ntime and energy into preparing for this evening. She’d sought\nto make a good impression, to represent her family in an\ninspiring and relatable manner.\nShe’d been a fool. Koben Yiro had delivered a rousing\npolitical diatribe, one that reinforced the Mountain’s message\nthat it was the clan more dedicated to preserving the country’s\nresources and traditions. And he’d done so in a way that even\nAyt Mada could not, further cementing the Koben family’s\npopularity.\nKoben Yiro stepped away from the podium amid\nresounding applause. Several Mountain clan members stood\nup at their tables to salute him. Press photographers snapped\npictures.\n“My husband is so silly,” Koben Bett remarked, leaning\ntoward Wen confidentially. “He was worried that the tone of\nthe speech would be too heavy for this lunch crowd.\nFortunately, I insisted that he stick with it. Well, now he’ll\nhave to admit he was right to listen to me.” She settled back in\nher seat and sipped her tea with a placidly savage smile.\n“You’re quite right, Mrs. Kaul. Men often do need our help.\nIt’s a shame our Pillars aren’t here to see what we do for our\nclans.”\nCHAPTER\n20\nProgress\nF\nrom the time he’d been the Horn of the clan, Hilo had\nhosted early morning drop-in training sessions for his top Fists\non Seconddays and Fifthdays at the Kaul estate. He did so to\nensure his highestranking warriors kept up their martial\nprowess, and also because he needed worthy sparring partners\nhimself. When some responsibility as Pillar forced him to miss\npractice, Juen or Lott ran the sessions. It had become a mark\nof considerable status on the greener side of the No Peak clan,\nto be invited to train at the Pillar’s home.\nFor the past three years, Hilo had invited Jim Sunto to join\nthem. It had raised some eyebrows among the Fists, but Hilo\nhad been interested in Sunto ever since their first encounter at\nthe Seventh Discipline gym. He was intrigued by the idea of\nmatching himself against an elite jade-endowed fighter trained\nby the Espenian system and seeing what he could learn.\nOn this morning, they faced each other as they first had\nseven years ago, only this time Hilo held a gun and Sunto had\na knife. They were deliberately training their lesser\nproficiencies. Kaul Hilo’s long-standing reputation as a talon\nknife fighter was unsurpassed, and Jim Sunto had extensive\nability with firearms.\nThe sun was barely up and the gathered Green Bones blew\ninto their cupped hands to warm them. The Pillar stood in the\ncenter of the lawn with his arms loose at his sides, a small,\nanticipatory smile tilting one side of his mouth.

        "text": "the next.\nA capable Green Bone can cross ten meters of ground in\nfar less time than it takes the average shooter to draw and aim\na handgun. Hilo had used that fact to lethal advantage\nnumerous times in his life. Anyone trying to draw a pistol on a\nGreen Bone with a talon knife, especially in the close quarters\nof a Janloon city street, would likely fall to the knife before\ngetting off a single shot.\nHilo needed to do the opposite of what he normally did in\na fight—create distance instead of reducing it. Sunto had\nrushed in at an angle, so rather than try to escape backward or\nsideways, which he could not do in time, Hilo drew his gun as\nhe dropped to the ground on his back. He fired upward.\nThe shot hit Sunto in the stomach. It was only a pellet gun,\nnot enough to break Steel, but enough to sting. Hilo rolled\naway in the grass and fired again from a crouch. Now he’d\ncreated too much distance and his opponent Deflected the\npellets with ease. To close the gap, however, Sunto had to\ncharge through the danger zone where he was too close to\neffectively Deflect but still too far away to reach his target\nwith the knife. Hilo shot the soldier again in the chest. It\nbarely slowed him down. The talon knife flashed toward\nHilo’s face.\nHe caught Sunto’s wrist, halting the blunted edge a\nfingertip’s distance from his throat. Hilo grinned. “You\ncould’ve finished me off if I hadn’t seen the knife coming so\neasily,” he said. “Draw my attention with your other hand,\nthen switch grip and cut this way instead.” He took the knife\nfrom Sunto and mimed a quick demonstration. The small\ncluster of watching Green Bones nodded.\nSunto made a noise of grudging appreciation. “Still didn’t\nget in three shots, though,” he said, rubbing at the bruise on his\nchest. The objective was to place three shots or a lethal cut. No\ndisarms. With skilled fighters, it was a contest of who got\nthere first. “Even if you’re stuck here”—Sunto held the gun\nclose to his own torso, as if trapped in a close quarters\nstruggle, and shifting so the other Green Bones could see\n—“you can still fire, if you angle it like this, so the slide is\nclear of your own body. That’s the third shot.”\nHilo clapped the other man on the shoulder. Sunto wore\ntoo little green to equal Hilo or any of his first-rank Green\nBones in a straight matchup of jade abilities. His proficiency\nwith Lightness and Deflection—the two disciplines that\nrequired the greatest expulsion of jade energy—was below\naverage. They were not emphasized in the Espenian military,\nas they broke unit formation and were of little use at long\nrange against automatic weapons. But Sunto was fast and\neffective and practical, and he knew certain techniques that\nwere not taught in the Academy curriculum or by any other\nprivate trainers as far as Hilo was aware of. Some of them\nwere not of much use to Green Bones. Hilo doubted his Fists\nneeded to know how to use ground-sweeping Deflection to set\noff pressure-sensitive or trip-wire bombs from a distance.\nOthers were more valuable.

At the Pillar’s request, Sunto had\ntaught a series of classes to the high-ranking Fists, as well as\nall the Green Bones in the Kaul family, on how to Steel to\nprotect oneself against an improvised explosive device. Years\nafter the tragedy, Hilo was still haunted by Kehn’s death, the\nimpersonal, dishonorable suddenness of it. If Sunto’s methods\nhad something to offer that might protect his family and other\nmembers of the clan from a car bombing, he would study\nthem.\nHilo handed the gun to Lott while Sunto gave the knife to\nVin, so they could take a turn. He watched his Fists spar until\neveryone had had a chance to practice. Observing those in\ntheir twenties, like Suyo and Toyi, made it clear to Hilo that he\nwas no longer young. His jade abilities were as formidable as\never. His strength and stamina equaled that of much younger\nfighters, and experience was a powerful advantage he was glad\nto possess. But a life spent fighting took its toll. Since turning\nforty, Hilo had noticed small things: He was not as fast as he\nused to be, it took him longer to recover from minor injuries,\nand older, more serious ones that had not bothered him for\nyears reminded him of past mistakes.\nThe sun was rising over the city, burning away the autumn\nchill. Hilo called an end to the training session. Sunto came up\nto him. “You mind if we talk for a minute?”\nA couple of nearby Fists looked askance at the man for\ntaking such a blunt and familiar tone with the Pillar, but Hilo\nwas not offended. That was Sunto’s natural way of speaking.\nIn front of his own men, however, Hilo forced the soldier to be\npatient. “I have a few things to discuss with the Horn. They\nwon’t take long, then we can talk.”\nAfter he’d spoken with Juen, and the rest of the Green\nBones had dispersed to attend to their own responsibilities,\nHilo sat down with Sunto at the patio table. He propped his\nfeet up on the seat of an empty chair. “How did General\nRonu’s report to the Royal Council go?”\n“Well enough that they increased funding to the training\nprogram,” Sunto said. “The chancellor commended us on how\nmuch progress we’ve made in seven years.”\nWith the hired guidance of Sunto and other international\nexperts, the Kekonese military had established the Special\nWarfare Command to oversee all special operations forces,\nmost notably the Golden Spider Company—the army’s\ngrowing cohort of jade-equipped soldiers, who had their own\nspecialized training and participated in exercises with ROE\nNavy Angels. The Kekonese military was still tiny in\ncomparison to most other countries, but now that it was seen\nas a further safeguard against possible Ygutanian aggression,\nthe Espenians were highly supportive of its growth, other\ndisagreements between the two countries notwithstanding.\n“I hear enlistment went up after the requirements were\nchanged,” Hilo said. “Master Aido said he’s had dozens of\ncalls from new students. Even Grandmaster Le is thinking\nabout using one of the Academy’s training fields to run an"

Even Grandmaster Le is thinking\nabout using one of the Academy’s training fields to run an\nevening or weekend program if enough instructors are willing\nto do it.” He lit a cigarette. “I’m impressed, Sunto. You’ve\nactually made people want to join the army.”\nIn the past, only recruits who graduated from a martial\nschool and had at least one year of experience as a clan Finger\ncould enlist with their jade, but Sunto had successfully argued\nthat was unnecessary, even counterproductive. “If we’re\nlimited only to Fingers who leave the clan, we’ll barely fill a\nroom each year,” he’d pointed out. All that was required now\nwas a medical certificate attesting to sufficient jade tolerance\nand basic proficiency in the six jade disciplines—roughly the\nequivalent of a year-four education at the Academy. That one\nchange opened the doors to those trained through after-school\nprograms and private instructors.\nThe patio door slid open and the new housekeeper, Sulima,\nbrought out tea, pastries, and sliced fruit for them. Sunto\naccepted a cup of tea, but didn’t eat. “General Ronu could get\neven more recruits if we started accepting adults without prior\njade training.”\nHilo replied with impatience. “Don’t bother going there\nagain.”\n“ROE Angels don’t start acclimating to jade at the age of\nten. That’s not needed when we have modern methods,” Sunto\nsaid, stubbornly ignoring the Pillar’s warning. “SN2 is safer\nthan SN1 was ten or fifteen years ago. There are fewer long-\nterm health effects and less risk of overdose. It’s still not good\nfor you, but neither is going to war.”\n“I’ve told you before,” Hilo said. “You won’t get any\nsupport for the idea of doping Kekonese soldiers. Shine’s legal\nonly when medically necessary.” Even when it was necessary,\nHilo thought sadly, the shame was too great. It had been for\nLan.\nSunto snorted in defeat. “That’s the same line I get from\nRonu. The stigma of SN1 is so high in this country, the\nKekonese military’s not willing to consider even voluntary\ndosing.”\n“You’re trying to improve the prestige of the armed forces,\naren’t you? No family would want their son to join an army of\nthin-blooded shine addicts.”\nSunto’s jade aura was ordinarily pale in Hilo’s mind. Not\nweak or dim, but pale—like a color that didn’t stand out or\ncatch the eye. Now, however, he felt it swell and darken.\n“Thin-blooded shine addicts,” the man repeated. “I suppose\nthat’s what you Green Bones think of all Espenian soldiers. In\ncase you haven’t noticed, we’re out here protecting this island,\nthis whole region of the world, and we’re using jade to do it,\nrisking our lives and our health. Not everyone is genetically\ngifted with jade tolerance, but that’s what science is for. That’s\nwhat progress is for.”\nSunto’s indignation made no sense to Hilo. The man was\nnot Espenian by blood, he did not use shine himself, and he\nhad voluntarily left the Navy Angels many years ago. But he"

But he\nspoke as if he were still an ROE soldier, so Hilo spoke to him\nas one. “Progress for us doesn’t mean becoming like you. You\nshould know that by now.”\nSunto sat back. “I do know it,” he said, no longer arguing\nbut clearly dissatisfied. “This isn’t how I wanted to come to\nthe point, but it does help explain my decision. I’ve done all\nthat I can with the training program. General Ronu has been a\ngood partner and we’ve made a lot of improvements, but it’s\ntime for me to move on. I’m leaving at the end of the month.\nThe Kekonese army has a strong foundation to work from, and\nRonu will continue building on what we’ve accomplished so\nfar, with someone else in charge.”\nHilo was accustomed to Sunto’s bluff manners, but he\nwasn’t pleased to hear the former Navy Angel was leaving the\njob that No Peak had placed directly in his lap, and he disliked\nthe way the man was delivering the news, as a thing that was\nalready done. Sunto was not a Green Bone of the clan, and so\nwas under no obligation to come to the Pillar for permission\nbefore making the decision, but they were hardly strangers\neither. Sunto’s role with the military had raised his profile and\nwealth, he’d trained with Hilo and his men, he’d been a guest\nat the Kaul estate many times.\nHilo let a reproachful pause rest between them before he\nresponded. “I’m disappointed to hear that, Lieutenant. I can\nsee you’ve made your decision, though, so I won’t try to\nconvince you otherwise. You’ve done everything I hoped you\nwould when we first met, and I’ve been glad to have you\ntraining with my Fists. So let’s part as friends.” He stood and\nextended his hand to Sunto, who stood as well and shook it.\nThey walked together toward the gates of the Kaul estate.\nWhen they reached Sunto’s car, the man stopped before\ngetting in. He brought a hand up absently to the gold icon of\nMount Icana hanging around his neck next to his jade dog\ntags, then dropped his arm and turned to face the Pillar.\n“There’s something else,” he said. “Working with the\nKekonese military has been a valuable career experience, and\nI’ve learned a lot from training with the Green Bones in your\nclan. I appreciate you giving me those opportunities. I respect\nyou as a leader, which is why I want you to hear this from me\ndirectly and not from anyone else later.”\nSunto’s pale jade aura shifted, as did his feet. “I’m starting\nmy own company. It’ll provide training, security services, and\ncombat support to governments and organizations. I’ve been\ntalking about it for some time with a couple of ex-Angel\nfriends who’re coming on as my partners.”\nWhen the Pillar’s initial reply to this announcement was an\nimmobile silence, Sunto explained, “It’s the ideal way to\ncombine all of my experiences as a Navy Angel, an IBJCS"

With\nall the conflicts the ROE military is engaged in around the\nworld, there’s a distinct and urgent need for contractors. My\ncompany will be the first with deep military experience and\nskilled operatives who have the ability to use bioenergetic\njade.”\n“A company of jade soldiers,” Hilo said. “Mercenaries.”\nSunto frowned, but stood his ground against the\nincreasingly dangerous look in Hilo’s eyes. “I don’t agree with\nthat term. This wouldn’t be a band of hired guns. I want to\ncreate a professional organization, one that adheres to high\nstandards and Truthbearing ideals.”\n“Truthbearing ideals. Foreign ideals.” Hilo’s posture was\nsubtly changing; his shoulders came forward, his fingers\ncurled, his chin tilted down.\n“I wouldn’t expect the Pillar of a Green Bone clan to\nunderstand or approve.”\n“You’re right about that at least,” Hilo snarled. The flare of\nthe Pillar’s jade aura made the estate’s guards look over in\nalarm. “Jade belongs on warriors who take oaths to their clan.\nNot on corporate soldiers.”\nSunto bristled defensively, his posture subtly coiling.\n“Your antiquated attitudes aren’t shared by everyone. I have\ncontacts in the ROE War Department who’re supportive. And\nthe wealthy entrepreneur Art Wyles has signed on as our first\nmajor investor.”\nThe guards came toward them, looking questioningly at\nHilo for direction. The Pillar held them in place with a glance,\nbut took a single step toward Sunto. “I handed you a career. I\ntrained with you. I treated you as a friend.” He spoke as if\nslowly drawing a weapon. “Think carefully about what you’re\ndoing, Lieutenant Sunto.”\nSunto took a step back and opened the door to his car, not\ntaking his eyes off Hilo. “I was afraid you’d react this way, but\nthere’s nothing personal going on here, Kaul. When we first\nmet, I told you I was here to mind my own business and make\nsome money. That hasn’t changed.” Sunto looked pointedly at\nthe guards and the closed gates, knowing he was at the Pillar’s\nmercy, but unafraid. “This may be hard for you to accept, but\nthere’s room in the world for more than one type of jade\nwarrior. I’m not founding a rival Green Bone clan that’s out to\nget you. The company will be headquartered in Espenia, with\na secondary office on Euman Island, under Espenian military\njurisdiction, with jade supplied by the Espenian government.\nYou’ll lead your clan according to your principles, and I’ll run\nmy company based on mine. There’s no reason for us to be at\nodds.”\n“You’re blindingly naive if you think that’s true.” With a\nsharp gesture, Hilo motioned for the gates to be opened.

When\nSunto got into the car, Hilo came over and put his hands on the\ndoor frame, leaning in and speaking through the open window.\n“This should be obvious, but I’m going to say it so that there’s\nno doubt between us: Don’t involve your military company\nand its foreign mercenaries here in Kekon. Ever.”\nSunto started the car. “The company’s called Ganlu\nSolutions International,” he said, calmly but with rare anger\nswirling through his jade aura like dark ink spreading through\nwater. “The name comes from a prince of Kekon who left the\nisland and was forgotten by his people, but who changed the\nworld.”\n“Get off my property,” Hilo said. “Before I kill you.” He\nturned and stalked back to the house, not bothering to watch as\nSunto’s car rolled out of the gates of the Kaul estate.\nCHAPTER\n21\nThe Meaning of Green\nthe fourteenth year, second month\nS\nhae’s doctor had cleared her to fly, and she was comfortably\nseated in business class, but nevertheless, the eleven-and-a-\nhalf-hour flight to Port Massy was not enjoyable at the best of\ntimes and was even less so when one was pregnant. There was\nno avoiding it, however. In a few months, she wouldn’t be able\nto make the transamaric flight at all, and she had matters to\ndeal with before then. She kept hydrated and got up every hour\nto go to the bathroom and stretch her legs by walking around\nthe plane. Thank the gods that at least she was past the nausea\nand exhaustion of the first trimester. She envied Hami\nTumashon in the seat next to her. The clan’s Rainmaker was\naccustomed to this flight and didn’t seem to mind it at all. He\nspent the first two hours working productively, reading\ncorrespondence and writing memos, then perused the Port\nMassy Post before falling asleep easily for the rest of the trip.\nWhen they arrived in Port Massy, Shae was amazed by the\ncold and the sight of dirty snow drifts lining every street. The\nwhite winter light stung her eyes as she and Hami exited the\nairport bundled in coats and scarves. Terun Bin, the clan’s\nMaster Luckbringer in Espenia, met them personally with a\ncar and driver. He saluted them and exclaimed, “Kaul-jen, why\ndidn’t you bring some Janloon weather with you?”\nOnce they were in the car, Terun blasted the heater, and\nwhen the driver pulled aggressively into the exit lane in front\nof irate honking cab drivers, he yelled back out the window in\nEspenian with a casual vociferousness on par with that of a\nPort Massy native. Terun’s highly animated but demanding\npersonality seemed to serve him well in Espenia.

Shae was looking forward to having\nhim back in Janloon, as Terun was one of the most keenly\nintelligent business minds she’d ever worked with, the sort of\nperson who could absorb a remarkable amount of information\nand see solutions before others were done asking the question.\nTerun turned over his shoulder and said, “Kaul-jen, I’ve\nmade all the arrangements we discussed. The meeting is set for\ntomorrow afternoon. We have reservations for a group dinner\ntonight at a restaurant not far from your hotel. If you’re feeling\nup for it, I know the staff here in Port Massy would be\nhonored to spend time with the Weather Man.”\nShae would’ve preferred to order in room service and go to\nbed early, but she accepted Terun’s invitation. As Rainmaker,\nHami made frequent trips between the clan’s branch offices,\nadmirably coordinating No Peak’s international business\nefforts between Janloon, Port Massy, the smaller, secondary\nEspenian office in Adamont Capita, and now Khitak in Tun—\nbut it was still important that the Weather Man herself make an\nappearance, so that the Luckbringers (or associates, as they\nwere referred to over here) saw that their work was personally\nvalued by the Kaul family.\nShae went to the hotel and even though it was well past\nmidnight back in Janloon, she called Woon to assure him she’d\narrived safely, knowing he wouldn’t sleep until she’d done so.\nHe hadn’t wanted her to make the trip at all even though Hami\nwould be accompanying her and Anden had personally told\nhim there was little health risk. Woon’s first wife, Kiya, had\nmiscarried several times, so he was fearful that something\nwould go wrong. For many years, Shae had depended on her\nformer Shadow’s stoic, reasonable optimism. It was a strange\nrole reversal for him to now be such a fretful husband. It was\nonly because he could not give up his long habit of being her\nchief of staff that she was able to convince him to stay in\nJanloon and manage the clan’s business affairs in her absence.\nAlthough two other people had held the role of Weather Man’s\nShadow since Luto’s death, Woon was who she still trusted\nmost to make important clan decisions on her behalf if the\nneed arose.\nAt times, Shae still awoke next to her husband with a sense\nof bewilderment. They’d been colleagues for many years\nbefore they were married, and although they no longer worked\nwithin sight of each other every day, that history still\noccasionally caused odd moments of strain. Shae had once\nembarrassed Woon by saying, “You know you can kiss me\nwithout permission when we’re not in the office, don’t you?”\nMore than once, he’d reminded her crossly, “You can’t end\ndiscussion like that. I don’t answer to you as Weather Man\ninside our own house.” Woon claimed it didn’t surprise or\nbother him that no one used Shae’s married name and\ncontinued to call her “Kaul-jen,” as they always had, but\nmarrying into the Kaul family under scandalous circumstances"

I\ncalled to make sure. Do you have the address and phone\nnumber?”\n“Yes, Papi,” Shae reassured him. “Anden told me already.\nDon’t worry.”\nHer pregnancy had been exhausting but uncomplicated so\nfar, but it was a comfort to know that she could legally obtain\ncare from a qualified Green Bone doctor if necessary. She\nhadn’t expected to conceive at the age of forty and, to be\nhonest, was still surprised with herself. As much as she cared\nfor her niece and nephews, Shae had never pegged herself as\nthe maternal type. She wasn’t sure she would’ve ever come\naround to the idea of having a child if it hadn’t been for Woon,\nwho was as happy as she’d ever seen him at the prospect of\nfinally becoming a father.\n“When Terun returns to Janloon, you could take some time\noff,” he said.\n“Let’s talk about that later,” she suggested. “How was the\nmeeting with the Espenian ambassador?” She managed to\ndistract her husband with talk of work, then got off the phone\nso he could get to bed. Sitting at the window and gazing out at\nthe wintry skyline, she rubbed her gently swelling belly,\nhoping to feel one of the small fluttering sensations that she\nthought might be the baby’s movement. She sometimes\nthought of her first, aborted pregnancy, and of Tau Maro, of\nhow much he’d loved his little nieces and would never have\nany children of his own, with her or anyone else. Because she\nhad executed him. In those moments, Shae would feel a cold,\ncreeping fear that she didn’t deserve this child, that something\nterrible would happen as just and fateful retribution.\nOnce, she shared her feelings of dread with her sister-in-\nlaw. Wen, who was not in the least superstitious, had scoffed,\n“Sister Shae, when is life ever like a story where the characters\nget exactly what they deserve, good or bad? You’re not used to\nbeing afraid, but every new mother is afraid. What you’re\nfeeling is only natural.”\nShae thought that was a touch unfair. She was no stranger\nto fear. Who else in the family regularly prayed to the gods?\nThe most honest prayers were inspired by terror.\nThe dinner that evening was held at a Kekonese restaurant\nthat was reputed to be the most authentic in Port Massy, with\nthe exception of a few popular Espenicized dishes on the menu\nsuch as smoked pork on toast and fried shrimp salad. The food\nwas surprisingly good, leagues better than anything Shae had\nhad when she’d been a student in Windton fifteen years ago,\nand she was happy to talk to so many of the clan’s expats and\nthe local staff. Nevertheless, she begged off early to make sure\nshe did indeed get enough sleep."

        "text": "and she was happy to talk to so many of the clan’s expats and\nthe local staff. Nevertheless, she begged off early to make sure\nshe did indeed get enough sleep.\nLate the following morning, she and Hami walked into the\nclan’s Port Massy headquarters. The Kekon Trade Partnership\nLiaison Office, as it read on the stenciled brass plate on the\ndoor and on the black glass directory in the lobby of the\nbuilding, had recently expanded to take over the entire twelfth\nfloor in the towering Packer Avenue skyscraper. The location\nwas smaller but almost as nice as the office tower on Ship\nStreet in Janloon, and certainly a far cry from the squat,\nmodest professional services building that had initially housed\nthe clan’s Espenian operations when Hami had first arrived in\nthe country. As they walked onto a busy office floor filled with\nthe sounds of ringing telephones, clacking keyboards, and\nconversations happening in Kekonese and Espenian, Shae saw\nthe gruff satisfaction on Hami’s face. No Peak’s success\noverseas was his personal legacy in the clan.\nThat success was still deeply, troublingly vulnerable.\nWhen Rigly Hollin and the two other partners of the\nadvertising agency WBH Focus arrived, Shae met them in the\noffice’s main conference room. She shook their hands,\nintroduced Hami and Terun, and said, in Espenian, “I’m\npleased to finally meet you in person, Mr. Hollin. My cousin,\nDr. Emery, has told me about how effective you and your firm\nwere at campaigning for the legalization of bioenergetic jade\nin the healthcare field. Your results speak for themselves.”\n“I’ve been looking forward to meeting you as well, Ms.\nKaul-jen,” Hollin said, impressing her by using the proper\nGreen Bone suffix and touching his clasped hands to his\nforehead in a Kekonese salute. She was surprised, until she\nremembered that Hollin had a Kekonese wife. “WBH Focus is\na global agency, and we’re keen to serve international clients.”\nShae gestured the advertising executives into chairs around\nthe table. Hami and Terun, both of them accustomed to\nEspenian business customs, took seats next to her. Shae said,\n“I trust you’ve been briefed on why we’re interested in hiring\nyour firm.”\nNodding avidly, Hollin opened his briefcase and began\ntaking out documents. “Getting bioenergetic jade legalized for\nmedical use moved it toward mainstream acceptance. But\nobviously you can’t win the rucket unless you follow through\non the toss off.” Despite the victories Anden had secured, the\nEspenian Physicians Society remained opposed to jade\nmedicine, and there was no movement toward a broader repeal\nof the civilian ban. Hollin handed out charts and tabulated\nsurvey responses. “Our preliminary market research reveals\nthat among the general public, bioenergetic jade is still viewed\nas dangerous, even unnatural or unTruthful—a view that\nreinforces prejudice not only against Kekonese people, but\nalso taints military veterans who find it difficult to reintegrate\ninto civilian life without stigma.”\nHollin laid several pages of photographs on the table.

        "text": "also taints military veterans who find it difficult to reintegrate\ninto civilian life without stigma.”\nHollin laid several pages of photographs on the table. They\ndepicted an open pit mine with scrawny men picking through\npiles of rocks, bombed-out buildings in war-torn Oortoko, and\nmug shots of barukan crime bosses. “These are the things\npeople associate with jade right now.” Hollin laid out a second\nset of images. “What if we could replace them with these ideas\ninstead?” Shae saw ROE Navy Angels hoisting the Espenian\nflag, a Kekonese doctor with a jade medical bracelet talking to\na mother and child, and a group of children training at the\nAcademy. She wondered how Hollin had gotten a photograph\nfrom inside the Academy. Then she realized it was a publicity\nphoto that the Academy itself used to promote its visiting\nstudent program to overseas Kekonese.\n“We aren’t selling soda or cars,” Hami said skeptically.\n“Jade isn’t something that ordinary people need, and they can’t\nbuy it for themselves. It’ll be hard to change opinions when\nyou’re not offering any tangible benefit.”\n“That’s what makes this such an exciting challenge,”\nexclaimed one of Hollin’s partners, a stout man with freckles\nwho’d been introduced as Bernett. “A complex, prolonged\nmarketing campaign to change widespread public perception\nof a product that can’t be purchased? I’m not sure it’s ever\nbeen done before, by any agency.”\nThe third partner, a dark-skinned man named Walford,\nsaid, “We believe the key is to connect bioenergetic jade with\npositive social values, particularly ones that Espenians already\nadmire about Kekonese culture, such as discipline, duty,\nhonor, strength, and the warrior ethos of protecting the weak.\nPeople will be receptive to accepting jade if it feels as relevant\nto our country as yours.”\nShae was surprised by the pang she felt at the foreigner’s\nwords. She picked up the photograph of the teenage Academy\nstudents, standing together attentively in their school training\nuniforms as an instructor and an assistant demonstrated a\nDeflection exercise. “Jade is a part of everything in Kekonese\nculture—our myths, our history, our way of life,” she mused\naloud. She touched the bracelet on her wrist. “Being green has\ngreater significance than the abilities a person gains.” Was it\npossible, she wondered, for anyone who was not Kekonese to\nunderstand that?\nHollin picked up a black permanent marker and began\nscrawling on the photo of the Navy Angels hoisting the flag\nand circling the words: warrior, honorable, green, patriot.\n“Bioenergetic jade has thousands of years of history in Kekon.\nThat’s not the case in Espenia. Which means we’re in a\nposition to define what jade means.”\n“We’re not the largest agency you could hire,” said\nWalford, “but with Rigly’s experience and passion for the\ncause, you’d be assured of our full commitment.”\nOne of the things that Shae appreciated about Espenians\nwas how enthusiastically mercenary they were. Lured by the\nprospect of a unique professional challenge and a lucrative\nmultiyear contract with a wealthy international client, one\nwould think that the three foreigners were ready to kneel and"

Lured by the\nprospect of a unique professional challenge and a lucrative\nmultiyear contract with a wealthy international client, one\nwould think that the three foreigners were ready to kneel and\nswear oaths to the No Peak clan. Then again, she thought\nwryly, was that any different from how Lantern Men behaved?\nShae thanked the partners of WBH Focus for coming. She\nsaid she would review the additional materials they left for her\nand contact them again soon. When the Espenians were gone,\nshe turned to her Rainmaker and Master Luckbringer.\n“This could prove to be a massive waste of the clan’s\nmoney,” Terun admitted with a sigh, “but over the years, our\nattempts to gain greater influence in ROE politics haven’t\ngotten us anywhere. Hamijen was bringing up concerns about\nthe ongoing costs and the enormous risk to the Espenian\nbusiness even eight years ago when I first came here, and with\nSlow War frictions between the countries, our reasons to worry\nhave only grown.”\nHami nodded. “The bill on medical legalization succeeded\nonly after the campaign went straight to the public. It could\ntake a long time, but continuing that approach might blunt the\neffects of racial prejudice and create support for a complete\nrepeal of the ban.”\n“Then we should pursue it,” Shae said. “Terun, whoever\nsucceeds you here will have to manage this additional priority.\nHami-jen, as Rainmaker, it’ll be important for you to be\ninvolved as well.” Both men nodded.\nShae placed a hand over her belly. What kind of a world\nwas her child being born into, where Espenian advertising\nexecutives might be defining the meaning of jade? Was that\nany sort of world, Shae wondered, in which to raise a Green\nBone?\nIt’s the world we have. At least she could ensure No Peak\nhad a hand in it.\nTerun said, “Kaul-jen, we should also talk about the news\nfrom Resville.” The Master Luckbringer dropped a recent\nedition of the Resville Gazette onto the table. It had been\nopened and folded over to an article stating that the opening of\nthe Sands of Illusion casino had been postponed for a second\ntime, as a result of costly delays due to unexplained difficulties\nin hiring and retaining contractors.\nHami read the article and snorted. “The Mountain must be\nfurious. It’s a good thing this Jon Remi fellow is on our side.”\nThe Sands of Illusion casino was not the only Mountain-\nowned property in Resville that had been recently beset with\nproblems. Several retail and gambling operations with\nMountain backing had run into mysterious business trouble or\nwere victims of robbery or arson. The Mountain was having a\nhard time defending its holdings and fighting back, as it\npossessed limited manpower on the ground in Espenia. The\nKekonese and Shotarian enforcers it brought in found it\ndifficult to operate in a city like Resville, where the myriad of\nlocal gangsters knew and hated each other, but hated outsiders\neven more.\n“Juen Nu has already sent Remi a secret shipment of jade,\nbut the man is also asking No Peak for half a million thalirs to\nbuy weapons and bribe local officials,” Terun said. “The"

In the same afternoon, she was authorizing a\ncampaign to publicly promote the positive aspects of jade, and\nfacilitating the transfer of secret funds to a Resville gangster.\nTrying to run a Green Bone clan in Espenia was a conundrum,\nfraught with contradictions. That was the cost of working in\nforeign territories and cultures, through intermediaries and\nallies. Of fighting proxy wars.\n“Move the money,” she said. “Quickly and quietly.”\nCHAPTER\n22\nSons of the Clan\nK\naul Rulinshin had been in Little Hammer before, on\nshopping trips and to school team relayball games,\naccompanied by an adult family member and at least two\nGreen Bone bodyguards. Usually Aunt Lina, the mother of his\ncousin Maik Cam, or Aunt Imrie, the wife of the Horn, or\noccasionally Ru’s uncle Anden, would take the children\naround town if the trip required leaving the city’s neutral and\nNo Peak–controlled districts. Ru’s father and mother and his\naunt Shae were too high in the clan to enter Mountain territory\nwithout important purpose and the permission or invitation of\ntheir adversaries. It was a matter of clan etiquette. Ru\nunderstood the rules; he was twelve years old, after all, and the\nson of the Pillar. So he knew that what he and his brother were\ndoing now—sneaking unaccompanied into an enemy district\nto watch Ayt Atosho duel a challenger—was not technically\nforbidden by clan law but was also not something his parents\nwould ever allow them to do.\nIt had taken threats to convince Niko to come along. Ru\nconsidered it necessary that his brother be part of the\nexcursion so they would be in trouble together if their parents\nfound out. Besides, Niko of all people should watch Ayt Ato\nfight so he could learn about the man he would one day have\nto contend with as a rival Pillar. It was for Niko’s own good.\n“I have exams coming up. I have to study.” Niko was\nfifteen, a year-five at the Academy. “I’m sure our Fists will\nhave spies with camcorders recording the whole thing. Even if\nthey don’t, there’ll be plenty of informers selling footage\nafterward.”\n“Come on! Aren’t you more cut than that?” Ru kept his\nvoice down so Jaya wouldn’t hear them.

The whole family\nwas home for Seventhday dinner, but the younger members\nhad been sent outside after dinner so the adults could hold\ntheir usual conversations in the dining room. If Ru’s sister\nknew what they were planning, she would demand to be\nincluded. She was only eleven, a whole fourteen months\nyounger than him, entirely too young to participate, but that\nwould not stop her from ratting them out to their parents if she\ndid not get her way. “Hearing about something isn’t nearly the\nsame as being there in person,” Ru insisted.\n“Is that what you’re going to say about the whipping you’ll\nget from Da?” Niko asked with deadpan archness. The Pillar\nmade Niko call him uncle, out of respect to his real father, but\nthe boys spoke of their parents as siblings would.\nRu had long ago discovered that his brother was oddly\nimpervious to goading. Not like Jaya. You could call Niko a\ncoward, an idiot, an ugly dogface, and he would only respond\nwith an unmoved, contemptuous stare. “Fine, then, I’ll go by\nmyself,” Ru said, deploying his final weapon, which he knew\nwas sure to succeed so long as he meant it, because in spite of\nall his apparent indifference, Niko would not allow his little\nstone-eye brother to get himself into deep shit.\nThe next day, a Firstday, they skipped school at the same\ntime and met at the subway station on Lo Low Street, where\nthey chained up their bikes and rode the train to their\ndestination. They did not expect to be recognized, but Ru kept\nthe hood of his sweatshirt pulled up over his head. Niko was\nwearing a billed cap and a zipped-up track jacket that covered\nhis Kaul Dushuron Academy uniform shirt. They were careful\nnot to talk about anything that might identify them as members\nof the Kaul family.\nIt was not, Ru reasoned, that they were in danger from\nenemy Green Bones. They were underage, and Ru was a\nstone-eye, so he was doubly protected by aisho. However, as\nRu’s mother frequently reminded him, opportunistic\nmisfortune was always possible. Accidents and\nmisunderstandings could be deadly. The wrong word or\ndecision could have terrible consequences in another clan’s\nterritory. All the Kaul children had heard the story of their\nuncle Anden being abducted by Gont Asch as intimidation\nagainst No Peak when he was eighteen years old, as a result of\nunintentionally wandering into Summer Park.\nWhen Ru and Niko emerged from the unfamiliar subway\nstation in Little Hammer, they had to consult a map to find the\nplaza where the duel was supposed to take place. Once they\nwere in the vicinity, it was easy to follow the crowd. Several\nMountain Fists and Fingers were standing around, keeping a\nspace clear for the combatants. The Kaul brothers maneuvered\ntheir way into an inconspicuous position among the spectators\nthat still allowed them to clearly see all the action.\n“That’s him,” Ru whispered. Ayt Atosho, twenty-two years\nold, a junior Fist of the Mountain, was dressed in loose black\npants and a traditional leather vest, a thirty-three-inch moon\nblade slung over his shoulder.

He was speaking to an older\ncouple who were probably his aunt and uncle in the Koben\nfamily, but he paused to smile and pose with Mountain\nloyalists who approached him with cameras in hand. Having\nnever seen Ayt Ato in person before, Ru had to unwillingly\nadmit that the photographs did not lie. The young heir of the\nMountain was tall and handsome, with smooth skin, spiky hair\ntinted red and fashionably mussed, and three jade stones\npierced above each eyebrow. If he was nervous about the fight,\nit didn’t show.\nA short distance away, Ato’s challenger paced back and\nforth. No one in No Peak knew much about Niru Von, other\nthan he was a junior Fist from a poor family. He was probably\nof a similar age to his opponent, but his pockmarked face\nmade him appear older. Rumor was that he and Ayt Ato had\nquarreled over the assignment of Fingers. Ato had made\nmocking comments about the other man’s management style\nand southern accent. Niru offered a clean blade.\nRather than happening on the spot, as would be typical for\nmost minor duels, the contest had been delayed for an entire\nweek, for no apparent reason other than to allow the Koben\nfamily to spread the news to the entire city. Ayt Ato was a\nminor celebrity, after all, and his relatives were not about to\nwaste an opportunity for publicity. Among the spectators\ncrowding the plaza were photographers from several tabloid\nnewspapers.\nRu craned his neck, hoping to catch sight of the Mountain\nclan’s leaders. It gave him a nervous thrill to be so close to\nGreen Bones he knew only by reputation as enemies of his\nfamily, men who would murder his father if given the chance.\nHe felt as if he were squatting in a pit of snakes. The muscular\nman with the heavy chain-link necklace of jade must be Aben\nSoro, Horn of the Mountain. He was standing a short distance\naway, arms crossed, speaking to two of his other Fists. Ayt\nMadashi was nowhere in sight.\n“What a circus,” Niko grumbled.\nAt last the duel began, fifteen minutes late on account of\nAyt Ato’s extended conversations. The crowd quieted as the\ntwo men touched their moon blades to their foreheads in\nsalute. Niru attacked first—a sudden rush combined with a\nclassic sequence of rapid cuts. Ato deflected the barrage\nneatly, leaping back Light, moon blade flashing defensively as\nhis opponent pressed him to the edge of the available space. At\nan expertly timed moment, Ato pivoted off the straight line\nand threw a tight Deflection that hit Niru between the shoulder\nblades from behind, sending the other Fist stumbling almost to\nhis knees.\nAto made a move forward to seize the advantage, then\nhesitated. Ru wondered if he’d been coached not to end the\nfight too quickly. Instead, the young man let his opponent\nregain his balance and waited for him to attack again, this time\nwith swift but predictable whirling slashes.

The two\nMountain Fists fought back down the length of the plaza, Ato\nnow clearly on the offensive. Both men were bleeding from\ncuts to their limbs where metal had made it past Steel and skin,\nbut the wounds seemed superficial, nothing that would end the\nfight.\nThe tip of Niru’s moon blade began to sag toward the\npaving stones. He made a valiant rally, throwing a triple blast\nof Deflections that Ato was hard-pressed to dispel, then\nlunging Light and bringing all his Strength down in an\noverhead chop. Ato met the blow, directing its momentum past\nhis shoulder and toward the ground with the angle of his own\nblade. Niru tipped forward and threw his arms wide to catch\nhis balance. Ato swept the man’s leading leg out from under\nhim, sending him to the ground.\nNiru’s moon blade clattered out of his hands as he broke\nhis fall. The man crawled to his knees tiredly and looked up\nthe length of Ayt Ato’s extended blade. “I concede, Ayt-jen,”\nhe declared. He sounded resigned and unsurprised, more\ndefeated in spirit than in body. With head bowed and eyes\ndowncast, he removed his jade rings and lifted a pendant of\nthree stones from around his neck. He laid them on the ground\nin surrender. “The clan is my blood, and the Pillar is its\nmaster.”\nInvoking the Green Bone oath was an honorable gesture of\nsubmission and clan allegiance, but for nearly thirty years, Ayt\nMadashi had been the only living person to be called “Ayt-\njen.” A prescient hush fell over the spectators.\nAto wiped his moon blade along the inside of his sleeve\nand sheathed it. “My blade is clean,” he declared. “You fought\nwell, Nirujen. I won only because my family and friends were\nhere to give me confidence.” It was a polite note on which to\nclaim victory, and the tension broke. The crowd murmured\nappreciatively.\nRu’s brother nudged him in the back. “There, we saw it,”\nNiko said. “Now let’s get out of here.”\nReluctantly, Ru followed as Niko weaved his way through\nthe slowly dispersing onlookers. Some people lingered to talk.\nOne man said to his friends, with disappointment, “Not nearly\nas exciting as Kaul Shaelinsan against Ayt Madashi twelve\nyears ago. Now that was a real duel. Haven’t seen a better one\nsince.” Ru smiled with pride for his aunt, and when he and\nNiko were away from the plaza, he told his brother what he’d\noverheard.\n“That’s a stupid comparison,” Niko said. “Ayt Ato and\nNiru Von weren’t fighting to kill. This was a show for the\nMountain clan, and everyone else, too. That’s why Niru put in\na decent effort but didn’t fight to his limit. I bet he took off\nsome of his jade before the duel.

Since he lost honorably and\nmade Ayt Ato look good, I wouldn’t be surprised if he has an\nenvelope full of cash coming to him.”\nRigged or not, Ru still thought the duel had been exciting.\nIt had given them an excuse to skip school to sneak into Little\nHammer and he still felt giddy with daring. He punched his\nbrother in the arm. “Ayt Ato is pretty good, but you’re better.\nYou could beat him for sure.”\nNiko looked at his younger brother in surprise. Then he\nfrowned, his left eye squinting. “I’m never going to fight Ayt\nAto,” he pointed out. “Unless both our clans have gone down\nin ashes and we’re the last people standing, so you better hope\nit doesn’t happen.”\n“The important thing is that you could beat him,” Ru said.\n“He was, what, fifteenth in his class at Wie Lon? Not bad, but\nso far, you’re in the top five, right?”\nNiko stopped on the sidewalk and faced his brother. “How\ndo you even know my school rank?”\nRu spread his hands. “What do you think, keke? I live at\nhome and hear Ma and Da talk about stuff. And we’re\npractically cousins with the Juen twins.” Ritto and Din were in\nthe class above Niko at the Academy.\nNiko frowned and stuffed his hands into the pockets of his\ntrack jacket. He started walking again. Ru jogged past him,\nskipping backward in front of his brother. “Once you graduate,\neveryone will know you’re a better Green Bone than that\npretty boy, and smarter too. When you have your first big duel,\nI’ll get everyone in my school to—” Ru glanced over his\nshoulder to check where he was going and spun to an abrupt\nstop. “What’s that?”\nThree people in black masks, two men and one woman,\nwere plastering the brick wall outside of the subway station\nwith posters. The largest one read, Free Kekon from Jade and\nTyrants! It was followed by a long list of names. Ayt. Kaul.\nMaik. Koben. Juen. Iwe. And onward—thirty of the most\nprominent Green Bone families in the country. The rest of the\nwall was being covered with black-and-white newspaper\nphotographs of the accused tyrants. The images were grainy\nfrom being enlarged and photocopied, but it took Ru only a\nsecond to find the faces of his father, his mother, his aunt\nShae, uncle Papi, and the pictures of several other leaders in\nNo Peak, parents of his cousins and friends.\nA wave of disbelieving outrage swept over Ru. “What’re\nyou doing?” he shouted.\nThe three vandals stopped and glared at the intrusion,\nshoulders and legs tense, ready to run from the police or Green\nBones. Seeing only two teenage boys, they relaxed and\nreturned to their task.

He drew his talon knife.\nNiko seized him by the arm. “Don’t be stupid,” he said in a\nlow voice.\nRu tugged against the grip, but his older brother was larger\nand stronger. Ru pointed the tip of his talon knife at the\nhoodlums, who’d stopped at the sight of a weapon and were\nwatching the boys with incredulous menace. “We can’t let\nthem keep doing that,” Ru insisted.\nNiko began to walk away, pulling Ru with him.\nRu planted his heels and refused to be dragged. He was tall\nfor his age and good with the knife, and Niko was an\nAcademy-trained future Green Bone. Why should they run?\n“We’re not going to do anything about it?” he shouted at this\nbrother. “What would Da think?”\n“Da wouldn’t want us to be here in the first place,” Niko\nsnapped.\nPeople passing by on the street were pausing now. Most of\nthem stared at the posters in disbelief and walked away, but\nthe sight of Ru still brandishing his drawn talon knife was\ncausing a stir, and murmurs of recognition began to rise.\nOne of the masked men jabbed an accusing finger at the\nKaul brothers, then pointed at the wall of photographs. You\nbelong on there with your family.\nA black Roewolfe G8 pulled up to the curb and stopped\nwith a squeal. The front doors flew open. Juen Nu and Lott Jin\ngot out of the car. The Horn of No Peak strode onto the scene\nas if to kill everyone there. Ru had never seen the man so\nangry. The three masked vandals dropped everything and fled,\npushing people out of the way as they sprinted away from the\nGreen Bones in different directions. Juen took no notice of\nthem. He seized Ru and Niko and shoved them toward the\nRoewolfe. “Get in the godsdamned car,” he ordered.\nA silver Victor GS pulled up in front of the Roewolfe.\nThree Green Bones of the Mountain—a Fist and two Fingers\n—got out. The Fist took in the scene—Juen and Lott, Niko and\nRu, the bystanders now hurriedly backing away.\n“Juen-jen,” said the Fist warily. “You found what you were\nlooking for.”\n“Tell your Horn that we’re leaving and there’s no trouble,”\nJuen said calmly, although his grip tightened on the back of\nRu’s shirt. “We’re all on the greener side here. We’re used to"

We’re used to\nhandling small, foolish problems that don’t require the\nattention of our Pillars, aren’t we?”\nA tense moment that felt like an eternity passed before the\nMountain Fist moved his chin a few degrees to glance at the\nfreshly plastered posters on the wall. “Did you see which way\nthose clanless dogs fled?”\n“There were three of them, and they split up.” Lott Jin\nvolunteered a description of the vandals and what they’d been\nwearing, then pointed out the directions they had escaped.\nThe Mountain Fist nodded cautiously and touched his\nforehead in salute. Lott opened the back door of the Roewolfe\nand Juen deposited Ru and Niko inside. The Horn and the First\nFist got into the car. Lott pulled it into the street. Ru looked\nout the window to see the Mountain Green Bones watching\nthem as they left.\nJuen spun around. “What were the two of you thinking?”\nhe demanded, so angrily that Ru shrank back into the seat. The\nHorn was the most fearsome position in any clan, but Ru had\nalways viewed Juen as Ritto and Din’s father, who lived in the\nhouse on the other side of the garden on the Kaul estate. He\nwas stern and sharpeyed but not frightening. Ru had heard\nother adults call Juen Nu a modern Horn, a manager Horn. It\nwas said that he commanded the military side of No Peak not\nwith the street charisma of Kaul Hilo or the stoic gravity of\nMaik Kehn, but with the organizational prowess of a man\nplaying three games of circle chess at the same time. In that\nmoment, however, Ru had no trouble believing that Juen Nu,\nlike anyone who rises to a high level on the greener side of the\nclan, was a man capable of considerable violence. “Are you\ntrying to cause a panic? Or a war?”\n“We just wanted to see the duel,” Ru explained. “We were\ncoming straight back.”\n“Ayt Ato’s duel? You thought it was worth skipping school\nand sneaking into Mountain territory for that?” The car\ncrossed from Little Hammer into Old Town, back into No\nPeak territory. Juen pointed to the nearest pay phone and Lott\nswerved sharply and pulled over. The First Fist jumped out\nand ran into the booth to place a phone call. Juen leaned over\nthe gear shift and turned off the engine.\n“What’s Lott-jen doing?” Ru asked.\n“What did you think would happen when your school\nreported you missing?” Juen demanded. “There’s an\nemergency phone chain for situations like this. Word goes out\nto hundreds of our Fists and Fingers in every part of the city.\nWhen the Academy couldn’t find Niko, they pulled Jaya out of\nclass and kept her under guard. She was furious. She also\nguessed where the two of you had gone. I had to send\nmessengers running to Aben Soro to beg leave from our\nenemies to search inside their districts. It would’ve taken only\none wrong rumor, one false witness, the suggestion that one of\nyou had been taken or harmed, for something terrible to start."

It would’ve taken only\none wrong rumor, one false witness, the suggestion that one of\nyou had been taken or harmed, for something terrible to start.\nLott is calling off the search now, before anything like that can\nhappen.” The Horn’s voice rose in disbelief. “And when I find\nyou, you’re standing around pointing a talon knife like you’re\ntrying to start a street fight in the middle of Little Hammer.”\n“Did you see those people, what they were doing?” Ru\nprotested.\n“Clanless anarchists have pulled that stunt across the city,”\nJuen spat. “They’re trying to shock people, to get media\ncoverage and foreign sympathy. Members of the Kaul family\nthreatening them with talon knives is the sort of thing these\nlunatics want. We have to catch and punish these people, but\nthat’s for me to deal with as Horn in our districts, and for Aben\nSoro to deal with in Mountain territory. Not for you; you’re a\ntwelve-year-old boy.”\nLott returned to the car and said, with relief, “Everything’s\nokay. We’re to take them back to the house.”\nEqual degrees of guilt and dread made Ru sink into his\nseat. “Please, Uncle Juen, don’t tell our ma and da that we\nwere in Little Hammer. Say you found us in the Armpit or\nsomewhere else,” Ru begged. “At least not Ma.” Even when\nhis father was furious, he was more forgiving of Ru’s antics.\nRu couldn’t count on the same lenience from his mother.\n“We can’t deny we were in Little Hammer, not when the\nMountain’s people saw us there,” Niko said, speaking for the\nfirst time since they’d gotten into the car. “Uncle Juen, we\nwere at the duel because of me. We took the risk of going into\nLittle Hammer so I could watch Ayt Ato fight and learn more\nabout him and his family.”\nAfter a moment of stupefied silence, Ru blurted, “Hey, it\nwas my idea!”\nNiko quieted his younger brother with a flat and dangerous\nlook that either came from being trained at the Academy as a\nGreen Bone or occurred naturally to men of the Kaul family\nonce they began nearing adulthood, because Ru had no idea\nhow to summon it himself.\nJuen studied them in the rearview mirror, eyes narrowed,\nperhaps trying to Perceive whether Niko was being sincere.\nNiko returned the Horn’s gaze calmly. The children of Green\nBones are adept at lying only by omission and never by being\noutright dishonest.\n“Uncle Juen, we should take Ru back to his school,” Niko\nsaid. “He has classes this afternoon and shouldn’t miss them.\nI’m the older brother and we went to the duel for my benefit,\nso I’ll go to the house and answer to our parents.”\nRu clenched his fists and opened his mouth to argue again,\nbut couldn’t come up with anything else to say.

But sometimes, Ru\ncouldn’t help but think it was unfair that Niko had taken his\nplace as the eldest son in the family.\nThis was not because Ru felt sorry for himself as a stone-\neye. He understood that he couldn’t grow up to wear jade or\nlead the clan, but that didn’t make him feel deficient or less\nloved. Of course, he felt excluded from the experiences of his\nsiblings and cousins, but his father always reminded him that\nhe also had things his brother and sister did not—his dog\nKoko, his own room at home with a video game console, more\ntime for relayball.\nNevertheless, Ru felt that between him and Niko, he ought\nto be the one in charge. He was the one who talked more and\ncame up with ideas for what they should do. Niko was quiet\nand went along with things—until he didn’t. Only when it\ninexplicably suited him would he suddenly assume the mantle\nof firstborn son and clan heir.\nJuen Nu took orders from no one but the Pillar. But Ru\ncould tell, from the amused glance and shrug that Juen\nexchanged with Lott, that the men were impressed by the way\nNiko had made his point. Speaking reasonably, accepting\nresponsibility, and most of all, taking a risk in order to gain\nknowledge and potential advantage over an enemy—all those\nthings were a credit to his greenness.\n“All right, Niko-se,” Juen said, once again sounding like\nthe goodnatured uncle Ru knew. Ten minutes later, Ru was left\nstanding on the front steps of his school, relieved and\nresentful, watching the Roewolfe turn out of the parking lot\nand drive toward home.\nCHAPTER\n23\nFriends of Friends\nthe fourteenth year, sixth month\nW\nen attended the Janloon Film Festival as the guest of Ren\nJirhuya, the artist she’d met seven months ago at a fundraiser\nluncheon. At his invitation, she’d given a speech at the annual\nconference of the Charitable Society for Jade Nonreactivity\nand done a short filmed interview, which was being used in\ntelevision ads to raise awareness and combat superstition. Wen\nhad taken a liking to the Abukei artist; he struck her as\ngenuine, personable, and motivated. She was pleased when he\nlanded a position as the assistant art director on a movie being\nproduced by Cinema Shore, one of Kekon’s few major film\nstudios.\nWhen Wen asked him to introduce her to people he knew\nin the industry, Jirhuya agreed but voiced reservations. “I’d\nlike to help you, Mrs. Kaul, but I don’t have any influence\nwith the studio,” he explained.\n“I’m not seeking any sort of influence,” Wen assured him.\n“I only want to learn about the business, and I prefer to meet\npeople as friends of friends.”\nAt the festival, Jirhuya introduced her to actors, directors,\nwriters, and to Sian Kugo, producer and co-owner of Cinema\nShore. “Mrs. Kaul,” Sian exclaimed, glancing nervously at\nWen’s bodyguards. “I had no idea you’d be here.” The Janloon"

The country’s movie\nindustry was small compared to that of nearby Shotar.\n“I enjoy getting out and attending cultural events whenever\nI can.” It was easier for Wen to do so now that she was more\nconfident in her body and needed to rely on the cane less\noften. She would never be completely healed, of course, but\nshe’d become adept at hiding moments of weakness or\nimbalance. To most people, she appeared normal in speech and\ngait. “Mr. Sian, will you sit down with me at the bar? I’d like\nto ask you some questions about the business, if you’ll indulge\nme.”\nThe filmmaker was happy to talk. “Kekon is a small film\nmarket. It’s hard to compete against the big-budget foreign\nfilms from Espenia and Shotar. And there’s television, of\ncourse—everyone has a screen at home and people wait for\nmovies to show up in video rental stores. I’m hoping the\nJanloon Film Festival will grow and attract more interest.”\nWen took a sip from her cocktail glass. She was on her\nfirst drink; the effusive studio executive was on his third.\n“Why do you think the Shotarian films are so popular?”\nMr. Sian wrinkled his nose. “Because people have no\ntaste!” Then he laughed and said, “I have to admit, they have a\nunique stylish, pulpy aesthetic. And their crime dramas are\naddictive. They’re always about grumpy but heroic Shotarian\npolicemen solving murders or conspiracies. The Shotarian\nstudios probably employ more Kekonese actors than we do,\njust to portray barukan gangsters.”\n“So most of the time, when foreigners see Kekonese actors\non-screen, they’re watching them play criminals in Shotarian\nmovies,” Wen said. “Does that bother you, as a Kekonese\nfilmmaker?”\nSian shrugged. “Sure, but that’s capitalism. Shotar is a\nlarge market and if actors are able to make a living by taking\nthese stock roles, what can you say?”\n“When I was growing up, I remember my brothers were\nalways reading comic books about Baijen, and there were\nmovies set during the occupation with heroic Green Bones\nfighting the Shotarians.”\n“I grew up on those too, but war films aren’t popular right\nnow, and there’s no international audience for Kekonese\nmythology,” the producer opined. “I’m focusing Cinema Shore\non medium-budget projects that have a better chance of getting\noverseas distribution. Action movies, spy thrillers, drama,\nhorror.”\nWen smiled and said, “Mr. Sian, I’m not a businesswoman\nand I don’t know much about the film industry yet, but what I\ndo have is the ear of the Pillar as well as the Weather Man.”\nShe paused. Even well on the way to his fourth drink, she\ncould see she had Sian’s full attention. “How would you go\nabout growing the Kekonese film industry?”\n_______\nWen convinced her husband they should take a vacation, just"

Niko and Jaya were at the Academy and\ncould call their uncles or aunts if they needed anything. Ru\ncould stay with his aunt Lina and cousin Cam for a few days,\nand besides, he was not allowed to go out with his friends for\nthe rest of the month as punishment for the trouble he and his\nbrother had caused. Hilo and Wen had no doubt whose idea\nthat had been.\n“Where do you want to go?” Hilo asked. “Marenia?\nToshon?”\n“I was thinking somewhere farther,” Wen said.\n“Marcucuo.”\n“Marcucuo?” Hilo raised an eyebrow and asked slowly,\n“Why Marcucuo?”\n“We hear about it all the time,” Wen said. “Why not go and\nsee for ourselves what it’s like?” The tiny city-state island of\nMarcucuo, off the east coast of Alusius, possessed an official\npopulation of only eight hundred thousand people but five\ntimes that number of visitors, seasonal residents, and foreign\nworkers.\nMarcucuo was a tax haven for the rich and famous, a\ntropical tourist mecca with every form of entertainment and\ngambling. Green Bones spoke of Marcucuo in a tone of\ndisdainful fascination, because it was the one place where jade\nwas openly used for sport and entertainment, in one-on-one\nmatches, staged stunts, and televised obstacle course\nchallenges. Many of the competitors were of Kekonese\nancestry—Keko-Shotarians and Keko-Espenians, primarily.\nOthers were shine-using foreigners, self-taught or ex-military.\nAnd some, to the disgrace of proper Green Bones, were\nKekonese—people who’d gotten their jade from families or\nschooling but had chosen not to take clan oaths, nor enter one\nof the noble professions.\nWen knew Hilo’s opinion on the entire industry. “A waste\nto put jade on circus monkeys,” he said. “Why give our money\nto that place?”\n“Whatever we may think of it, people in other parts of the\nworld are going to use jade differently than we do, and some\nKekonese are going to be attracted to those foreign ways.\nWe’ve fought the Mountain, and Ti Pasuiga, and the Matyos\nbarukan, and the Espenian Crews—all of them have done\nthings to corrupt the meaning of jade. But maybe we haven’t\nthought enough about how we can shape that meaning\nourselves and use modern-day culture to our own advantage.”\nHilo gave her a long look. “This isn’t really a vacation, is\nit?”\n“Of course it’s a vacation,” Wen said, giving her husband a\nhurt look. “There are lots of things to see and do in Marcucuo,\nand the weather’s nice. We can go to the beach, and I want to\ndo some shopping, too. If we also happen to learn a few things\nor talk to a few people that could be useful to the clan, then so\nmuch the better.”\nShe was pleasantly surprised when her husband agreed to\nthe trip without pressing for more details.

Hilo was a direct\npersonality; Wen had heard him speak sharply to his men,\ndemanding specifics if they made the mistake of giving him\ngeneralities or possibilities. But Wen held ideas close and quiet\nuntil they were nearer to reality. At times, she envied the\napparent ease of Shae and Woon’s working relationship, which\nshe did not yet have with her own husband. Despite the relief\nof being able to talk openly about clan issues, she could tell\nHilo chafed at how her role as Pillarman ate into their time\ntogether. It was easier to discuss things when they were\ncontented as husband and wife first.\nSo it was only after they woke and made love and were\nlying spent and sweaty in bed on their second morning in the\nGolden Spire Hotel & Casino overlooking Grace Square in\nMarcucuo that Wen said, “We’re going to a party tonight. It’s\nat the mansion of Sel Lucanito. He’s the Tomascian media and\ngaming tycoon who owns Spectacle One, the largest of the\njadesports promotion companies.”\nHilo rolled over and sat up. “All right,” he said firmly.\n“You’ve been cagey for long enough about what we might\ngain from being here. Tell your Pillar why he should care\nabout going to this party.”\nWen looked up at him, noticing the way the tropical\nsunlight streaming in from the windows lit the jade on his\nbody. “Do you remember I talked to you and Shae about No\nPeak investing in Cinema Shore and the Kekon film industry?”\n“What about it?”\n“The public relations campaign Shae’s begun in Espenia\nhas made me think about how there’s a different kind of war\ngoing on these days. A war for people’s thoughts and feelings.\nThe Kobens already know it.” She was still galled by how\neasily Koben Yiro had upstaged her with his zealous rhetoric.\n“So does the Clanless Future Movement, when they paint the\nclans and jade as outdated and evil. That’s what some people\nare led to believe, when they see news about jade used in\nforeign wars, or watch movies with barukan villains.” Wen got\nup and walked naked to the dresser, pinning up her hair. “We\ncan change that.”\nHilo lit a cigarette. She turned to give him a sour look—\nshe was trying to encourage him to quit—but they were on\nvacation after all. “We’re not getting into the jadesports\nbusiness,” Hilo said with finality.\n“No,” Wen agreed. “But we can take from it.”\nThe phone on the desk rang. Wen picked it up. “I’m sorry\nto interrupt your vacation,” said Juen’s voice. “Is Hilo-jen\nthere?” Wen handed the receiver to Hilo. She washed up and\ngot dressed while her husband spoke to the Horn, smoking and\npacing back and forth in the hotel room as far as the phone\ncord would allow. When he hung up, she gave him an anxious,\nquestioning look.\n“Five of our Green Bones were ambushed and killed in\nLukang last night,” he told her. “No one that you know,” he"

The Mountain found out about it and whispered their\nnames.” He stubbed his cigarette out angrily, grinding it into\nthe ashtray.\n“Do we need to cut our trip short?” Wen asked worriedly.\nHilo shook his head. “Juen’s got it under control.”\nWen sat down on the end of the bed and watched her\nhusband put on his clothes. Outside, Marcucuo’s weather was\nbalmy and cloudless. Birdsong and the fragrance of blooming\nflowers from the Golden Spire Hotel’s lush gardens saturated\nthe morning air beneath their hotel room balcony. No matter\nwhere they were in the world, however, they were never far\nfrom the feud, and the designs of their enemies.\nHilo finished buttoning up his shirt. He came over to her\nand cupped her jaw, then kissed the top of her head. “Ayt\nMada’s not going to ruin our vacation. I’ll have things to deal\nwith when we get home, but let’s enjoy ourselves while we’re\nhere.”\n_______\nEight hours later, they were welcomed into the foyer of a\nthree-wing Alusian-style stucco mansion by Sel Lucanito. As\nthe Pillar’s wife and his Pillarman, Wen had met many\nwealthy and powerful people, but they were usually affiliated\nwith No Peak and seeking audience with the Pillar. It was\ndifferent to be walking into the home of a foreign stranger,\nwith none of the clan’s Fists or Fingers to be seen. She was not\nnervous—she was with Hilo, after all—but she did feel out of\nher element, reminded that as mighty as the No Peak clan had\nbecome, Kekon was still a small nation and there were people\nin the world with more money and influence than could be\nfound on their island. A number of such people came to\nMarcucuo to entertain themselves in grand fashion and hobnob\nwith fellow millionaires.\nSel Lucanito was a man who took up space not only with\nhis height—he was a head taller than most of the other men in\nthe room—but his expansive hyperenergetic presence. The\nmultimillionaire owned residences in Tomascio, Espenia, and\nMarcucuo, spoke three languages, and owned several casinos,\na network television company, and Spectacle One. Although\nhe had never crossed paths with any of the Kauls in person, he\nknew who they were. It was impossible to be in a business\nwith any connection to jade and not be aware of the Green\nBone clans. Lucanito had gone to the trouble of learning “May\nthe gods shine favor on you” in Kekonese, for the express\npurpose of greeting the Kauls on their arrival. With Tomascian\nchivalry, he bent into an impressively graceful bow given his\nheight, then shook their hands with enthusiastic warmth and\nsaid, in Espenian, “I’m delighted you came.

There’s nothing\nlike the mystique of the traditional Green Bone warrior to\ndraw viewers.”\nHilo gave the entertainment tycoon the sort of smile that\nWen knew he reserved for men he was treating nicely despite\nhis personal opinion of them. She’d seen him use it on plenty\nof politicians, bureaucrats, and overly demanding Lantern\nMen. On the surface, it resembled his typical lopsided grin.\nOnly someone who knew Hilo well could see when his eyes\nheld none of the easy warmth of his true smile. She gave his\nhand a soft squeeze, reminding him to be polite, even to this\nforeigner whose true passion was making money off the jade\nabilities of others.\n“You throw a great party,” Hilo said in rough Espenian,\nnodding at the man’s lavish house, the swarm of well-dressed\nguests, and the abundant spread of food and free-flowing\nalcohol. “My wife insisted we couldn’t come to Marcucuo and\npass it up.”\nSel Lucanito beamed and threw his arm toward the revelry.\n“Please, enjoy yourselves! There’s so much we could talk\nabout, and I hope we do, but I won’t monopolize your time.\nYou’re the first Green Bone clan leaders I’ve had the pleasure\nof hosting, and everyone is going to want to meet you.”\nWen spoke up quickly, as if an exciting thought had\noccurred to her in that instant. “I heard that Danny Sinjo\nwould be at this party. Is that true, Mr. Lucanito? I would love\nto meet him.”\nLucanito was happy to confirm that, indeed, Sinjo was\nhere, and he brought Hilo and Wen out to the poolside, where\nhe introduced them to the Keko-Espenian jadesports star, his\ngirlfriend, and his manager. Danny Sinjo was indeed movie-\nstar handsome, with arresting eyes and a flawless jawline, but\nhe had the build and posture of a real fighter. Like all Keko-\nEspenians, he wore his jade out of sight, but Wen could\nimagine him passing as a Fist on the streets of Janloon, if not\nfor his jagged overlong haircut and a face that was a bit too\npretty to appear credible.\nSinjo was caught off guard by the introduction. After\nsetting down his drink and shaking their hands, he said, “Wow.\nThis is sure something.”\nWen said, “Congratulations on your big win.” Sinjo had\nrecently defeated a Shotarian fighter to retain his title as\nsuperchamp in Spectacle One’s televised World Warrior event.\nWen had first heard about Danny Sinjo from Anden, who’d\ndescribed the underground jadesports training culture in\nResville after his first trip to that Espenian city. Since then,\nshe’d followed Sinjo’s rise with interest. He might not be a\nproper Green Bone in Hilo’s eyes, but there was no denying\nthe man’s jade abilities.

He’d been well trained and had made trips to\nKekon to learn from the best private coaches there. Now he\nwas an actor; he’d already appeared in a recent Shotarian film\nand was in talks about future roles.\n“Do you speak Kekonese, Sinjo-jen?” Hilo asked.\nThe man blinked. Wen suspected that Sinjo, for all of his\ngrowing fame, had never been addressed with the respectful\nGreen Bone suffix before. It surprised Wen as well, to hear\nHilo use it, and to see her husband smiling, sincerely this time.\nSinjo said, in Kekonese, “My Kekonese is okay, but not\ngreat.”\n“No problem,” said Hilo. “You speak it well enough, and I\nknow enough Espenian to get by. I’m glad to see another\nKekonese face in this crowd. My cousin saw you years ago, in\nResville. And now my own wife is a fan and insists I have to\nmeet you.”\nSinjo did not seem like a modest man. Wen had seen him\nposing and prancing for the audience on television. Now he\nglanced at the Kauls and seemed at a loss for words. “Seer’s\nballs, I’m flattered.”\nHilo said, “Have you ever thought about coming back to\nKekon?”\n“Honestly, no,” Sinjo said. “No offense, but there’s nothing\nfor me there.”\n“There might be more than you think. No matter how\nmany sport fights you win for Lucanito, or how many bad\nguys you play in the Shotarian movies, your face will always\nbe Kekonese. No one will ever appreciate you as much as your\nown people.” Hilo put a friendly hand on Sinjo’s shoulder and\nhanded him a drink from the tray of a passing waiter, taking\none for himself as well. “It’s crowded by the pool. Why don’t\nwe walk over there and have a quieter conversation? Bring\nyour manager if you like.”\nWen smiled encouragingly and struck up a conversation\nwith Sinjo’s girlfriend—a thin, pale-haired Espenian woman—\nso that the men could take a stroll and talk about serious\nmatters. The party was getting increasingly crowded and noisy\n—a band had started playing, and several people had fallen\ndrunkenly into the massive blue swimming pool—but Wen\nwas relaxed now. She’d seen Sinjo’s awestruck expression.\nFor the most part, everyone who wore jade, no matter their\nupbringing, nationality, or bloodline, viewed the Green Bones\nof Kekon with a certain fearful reverence. The up-and-coming\nyoung movie star Danny Sinjo was not so far removed from\nhis heritage that he could fail to appreciate the significance of\nreceiving personal attention from the Pillar of the No Peak\nclan.\nWen had complete confidence in her husband’s ability to\ncompel any man he befriended. Tomorrow morning, she\nwould call her sister-in-law in the Weather Man’s office. By\nthe end of the week, Sian Kugo would be a Lantern Man of No\nPeak, Cinema Shore would belong to the clan, and Danny\nSinjo would star in its films.\nCHAPTER\n24"

He’d never\nspoken to her on the phone before, even though he’d asked for\nher number many times. At Galo’s urging, he’d tried to make\nfriends with her, even taking her out for noodles and paying\nthe bill, yet he still hadn’t managed to get between her legs.\nNor had Bero gotten closer to uncovering the details of Vastik\neya Molovni’s plans, much to the displeasure of his Espenian\nhandlers. He was still considering forcing himself on Ema, but\nif she was fucking Molovni, that ugly Ygutanian bastard might\nkill him, or at least kick him out of the group, which would\nmean the end of his lucrative arrangement with the Espenians.\nSo when Ema told him, “I don’t give out my number,” he\ngave her his number instead. But she had never called. Until\nnow.\n“It’s Ema,” she said. “From the clanless meetings.”\n“Ah, hey,” said Bero, frowning, but suddenly excited.\n“You called.”\n“Listen, I know that I haven’t been all that nice to you. I …\nhave a hard time letting other people get close to me. I know it\nmust make me seem rude sometimes.” She paused. “Anyway,\nI was wondering if you’d like to get together tonight.”\nBero thought about saying no just to spite the standoffish\nbitch, but the impulse only lasted for half a second. “Sure,” he\nsaid, trying to sound nonchalant. “I’m not doing anything right\nnow. Where do you want to go?”\nAfter a moment of silence, Ema said, “I don’t feel like\ngoing out. Not tonight. I have a bottle of hoji here at my place.\nDo you want to come over?”\nBero went over. On the way, he stopped to buy a bag of hot\nfried bread from a fast food stand and a packet of condoms\nfrom the drugstore. Ema lived in an old, three-story apartment\nbuilding behind an adult video rental shop in the Coinwash\ndistrict. Bero climbed to the top floor and knocked on her\napartment door. She opened it, smiled wordlessly, and held the\ndoor open for him to come in. She was wearing only a white\nbathrobe and no clothes underneath. The air in the apartment\nwas damp and smelled of orange blossom; it seemed she’d just\ngotten out of a bath. She hadn’t waited for him to arrive to\nopen the bottle of hoji.\n“Fried bread, thank the gods,” she said, and took a stick of\nit from the bag.\nDespite his eagerness to get started, Bero took a moment to\nwalk around the one-bedroom apartment curiously. It was tiny,\neven smaller than his, but the things inside of it were\nexpensive. Ema had an LCD television, and a stereo with a\ncassette tape deck.

        "text": "expensive. Ema had an LCD television, and a stereo with a\ncassette tape deck. Her open closet was filled with brand-name\nclothes, handbags, and shoes, and the jewelry lying on her\ndresser was real gold. Bero couldn’t think of why, if she had\nenough money to buy such nice things, she would be living in\nthis neighborhood.\nHe sneered. All her belongings must be gifts from rich\nmen.\nResentfully, he remembered that his Espenian handlers\nwould want him to take this opportunity to gather information.\nThere didn’t seem to be many obvious clues about Ema’s\npersonal life besides a framed family photograph on top of her\ndresser. A man and woman with three boys and two girls,\nstanding on the deck of a boat with the ocean in the\nbackground. Ema was a teenager in the photograph—the\nsecond-oldest child. She was standing beside her elder brother,\na Green Bone.\n“Come here,” Ema said, patting the sofa cushion next to\nher. She poured him a glass of hoji. Bero took off his jacket\nand sat down next to her, accepting the drink.\n“Why do you hate the clans so much if your brother is a\nGreen Bone?” he asked.\nEma tipped back her drink, her throat bobbing as she\nswallowed. The soft skin of her neck and chest was flushed\nfrom the bath and the liquor. “My brother’s dead,” she said,\nputting the glass down and refilling it. “He was executed.” She\nturned to Bero, eyes bright and glassy. “What about you? Do\nyou have family?”\n“No,” Bero said.\n“You don’t have anyone you’re close to?”\nThe hoji burned down Bero’s throat and warmed him. He\nthought about the people he’d associated with over the years,\nespecially the ones he might’ve said were something close to\nfriends. Sampa. Cheeky. Mudt. All of them dead or gone.\nBero’s relationships did not last. “Something always got in the\nway,” he said. “Jade. Jade always got in the way.”\n“I’m sorry for you.” She didn’t sound as if she were\nmocking him, just being honest. She moved closer to him. Her\nrobe fell open and he saw her breasts and dark nipples. “Do\nyou think the gods exist?” she asked unexpectedly. “Do you\nthink they see and judge us, the way the penitents say they\ndo?”\nBero’s cock was pushing uncomfortably against his pants.\nHe frowned at the question. It wasn’t one he thought about\ndeeply. He’d had enough close calls and strange swings of\nluck in his life that at times he thought surely some bigger\nforce loomed over him, watching him, batting him around like\na mouse.\nAt other times, he thought there was nothing out there, that\ndesperate people were deluded and strived in vain, that they\nsaw patterns and signs when there were none to see. In his\nown life, nothing he’d ever done truly added up to anything\ngreater. There was no bigger picture; his runs of fortune and\nfailure canceled each other out. Sometimes he skimmed above\nthe water and sometimes he floundered below it, but still he\nwas just a fish in the unknowable and merciless ocean."

Sometimes he skimmed above\nthe water and sometimes he floundered below it, but still he\nwas just a fish in the unknowable and merciless ocean.\n“I don’t think it matters if the gods exist,” Bero said. “If\nthey gave me this shitty lot in life, then I don’t give a fuck\nwhat they think.”\nEma gazed into his eyes with calm agreement. “Me\nneither.”\nShe took his cock out of his pants and lowered her head\ninto his lap. Her damp hair spilled over his stomach as she\nsucked him. When he was close to coming, he pushed her\ndown and they fucked on the sofa. They moved to the single\nbed and fucked again. Ema fucked with her eyes closed, with\nrelentless, mechanical, angry desperation. She didn’t even\nmake him put on a condom. After Bero was done, she kept\nriding him and rubbing herself urgently until she came. Bero\nwas honestly bewildered. After years of rebuffing him, he\nwould’ve liked it if she’d put on more of a show of her usual\nhaughtiness, maybe resisted a little, made it more challenging.\nAs it was, the sex was fine, very good, it was sex after all, but\na bit anticlimactic considering how long he’d had to wait for\nit.\nAfterward, he wanted to fall asleep, but she shook his\nshoulder and said, “You have to go.” Bero rolled over and\ngrumbled, but she shook him again and he raised his head in\nirritation. A couple of hours ago, Ema had been drunk and\nneedy, but now she was standing up, wrapping herself in her\nrobe, strangely sober and purposeful, with a vaguely vacant\nlook in her eyes. “It’s tomorrow,” she told him. “It’s happening\ntomorrow.”\nAt first, he couldn’t understand what she was talking\nabout. Then he sat up. “What’s happening tomorrow?” He was\nawake now. “It’s what you and Molovni and the others have\nbeen planning, isn’t it? The great strike of the clanless.”\nEma wrote something down on a slip of paper and handed\nit to Bero. “Go to this address in the Docks at four o’clock\ntomorrow afternoon. That’s where we’re meeting after it’s\ndone. Vastik will be there with a boat nearby, ready to get us\nout of the country.”\n“Out of the country?” Bero repeated in confusion,\nscowling at the paper in his hand. “Why are you giving this to\nme? Molovni doesn’t want anything to do with me. I was\nnever brought into the plan.”\nEma bent over him and placed a strangely chaste kiss on\nhis cheek, the crooked one that had been damaged so many\nyears ago. “You’re in it now,” she said, “because you’re my\nfriend. Vastik won’t have a choice.”\nBero said with a jealous sneer, “So you can get Vastik to do\nwhatever you want?”\nEma gave a humorless laugh. “Molovni has to do what his\nmasters in Dramsk tell him to do. Just because I hate the clans\ndoesn’t mean I have any love for the Ygutanians.” She picked\nup Bero’s discarded shirt and pants and handed them to him."

Just because I hate the clans\ndoesn’t mean I have any love for the Ygutanians.” She picked\nup Bero’s discarded shirt and pants and handed them to him.\nAs he dressed reluctantly, she rummaged in her purse and\npulled out a wad of money. “Here,” she said, handing it to\nhim. “It’s late. Take a taxi.”\n“That’s more than I need for a taxi ride,” he said, eyeing\nthe cash but taking it anyway and stuffing it into his pocket.\n“Why won’t you tell me what you’re going to do? Maybe I\ncould help, you know.” He knew he sounded whiny. Angry.\nEma gave him a deflated smile and drew her robe more\ntightly around herself. “You have. I needed a good fuck\ntonight, and you gave me that.” She went to the door and\nopened it for him. “Lie low tomorrow. Just be at that address\non time.”\n_______\nWhen Bero got back to his apartment, he called the special\nnumber he’d been given by the Espenians, the one he’d been\ntold to use only for emergencies, if his position as an informer\nhad been compromised, if he was in mortal danger, or if he\nhad some vital or urgent information. It was past midnight.\nThe phone picked up after the third ring. “Who is this?”\ndemanded Galo’s sleepy voice.\n“Catfish.” Bero winced; he still hated his code name. “It’s\ntomorrow. Whatever Molovni is planning with the leaders of\nthe clanless, it’s going to go down tomorrow.”\nGalo was instantly alert. “How do you know this?”\n“The girl. Ema. I finally got to her. I went to her apartment\nand everything.”\n“What exactly did she tell you?”\n“She wouldn’t tell me anything,” Bero groused. “All I\nknow is that it’ll happen tomorrow, and Molovni has a plan to\nget them out of the country afterward.”\n“What’s the girl’s address?” Galo demanded.\nBero hesitated. He had a sudden vision of Espenian\nsoldiers surrounding Ema’s building in Coinwash and breaking\ndown the door. He imagined her being dragged from her\napartment and thrown into the back of an unmarked vehicle, to\nbe taken to an Espenian military installation and never seen\nagain.\nHe wasn’t sure why the thought bothered him. He barely\nknew the girl. Just because he’d been wanting to bed her for a\nlong time and finally succeeded didn’t mean he owed her\nanything. She’d acted like an aloof bitch to him for years, and\ncome to think of it, she’d been rude tonight, the way she’d\nkicked him out in the middle of the night. The Espenians,\narrogant and demanding as they were, were paying Bero well.\nSo he was confused by his own reluctance.\n“What are you going to do to her?” he asked.\nGalo was also surprised by Bero’s question. “Why do you\ncare?”\n“I just want to know,” Bero snapped. “She’s just a girl, all\nright?

If I tell you her address, what’re you\ngoing to do to her?”\nA long moment of silence from the other end of the line.\nThen Galo mumbled, “Catfish, you surprise me. Of all the\ntimes to grow a sliver of conscience, you have to do it now?”\nThe Espenian went on in a slower, more soothing tone. “We’re\nnot going to hurt her. We’re not going to tip our hand at all\nuntil we have to. Your girl is a line to Molovni, and Molovni is\na line to the Ygutanian military and the nekolva training\nprogram. Tomorrow morning, we’re going to watch her\napartment, and we’re going to follow her until she leads us to\nMolovni. I promise she won’t be in danger from us.” When\nBero still failed to answer right away, Galo’s voice turned\nsharp. “Give us the address, Catfish.”\nBero gave them Ema’s address. There was a strange,\nunfamiliar curl of worry in the pit of his stomach, and he\ndisliked it. “What about me?” he asked. “What am I supposed\nto do? What if Molovni and the clanless find out that I ratted\non them?”\n“Don’t do anything,” Galo said. “Just stay out of the way.\nIf it looks like you’re in danger, we can pull you out. Keep this\nnumber handy, and don’t say anything to anyone.” He paused\nand Bero heard him speaking rapidly in Espenian to someone\nelse before coming back onto the line. “Is there anything more\nyou can tell us?”\nBero took out the slip of paper in his pocket and rubbed it\nbetween his fingers. If following Ema failed to lead the\nEspenians to Molovni and his coconspirators, this would be\nthe surefire way to find all of them tomorrow, at four o’clock\nin the afternoon.\nBut a safe house with a getaway boat … That could be\nvery useful to Bero. In case something went wrong. In case the\nEspenians hung him out to dry after all.\n“No,” he said. “Nothing else.”\nGalo said, “You’ve done a good thing, Catfish.” He hung\nup.\nCHAPTER\n25\nThe Great Strike\nthe fourteenth year, seventh month\nH\nilo had never looked forward to KJA meetings, but he used\nto be able to avoid them. When it had been created forty years\nago, the KJA’s sole purpose was to manage the production and\ndistribution of the nation’s jade supply. The quarterly meetings\nwere typically filled with discussion of budgeting, economic\npolicy, export quotas, and domestic jade allocation. It was not\nuncommon for clan Pillars to let their Weather Men handle the\nmeetings, sometimes arriving only at the end of the session to\ncast any necessary votes.\nIn recent years, however, the KJA had expanded well\nbeyond its original purpose as a state cartel to become a wide-\nranging policy group on all issues related to jade. Special\nsessions had been convened to discuss what the KJA’s official\nposition should be on military reform, non-Kekonese citizens\nstudying at Kekonese martial schools, and jadesports in"

The Green Bone clans had\nused the KJA to take unified public stances opposing\ndecriminalization of shine, anti-dueling laws, and political\nextremism. On one hand, the evolving function of the KJA did\nmake for less boring discussions. On the other, Hilo was\nforced to spend far more time than he wanted sitting in a room\nwith his enemies.\nWhen he arrived with Woon, both he and the clan’s\nSealgiver were greeted with warm, respectful congratulations\non the birth of a healthy child into the Kaul family. Woon,\nsleep-deprived and smiling constantly, was as happy as Hilo\nhad ever seen the man. No doubt he would prefer to be with\nShae and their newborn daughter at this moment, but he would\nbe the acting Weather Man for the next several months, taking\nover Ship Street in Shae’s absence, as he had at other times in\nthe past.\nAyt Madashi arrived with Koben Yiro. Over the years, the\nMountain had made changes to its organization as well. To\nHilo’s knowledge, Ayt had never had a Pillarman, but the\ninsufferably grandstanding Koben Yiro appeared to have\nbecome her unofficial aide in addition to being her frequent\nmouthpiece. Hilo couldn’t tell if Ayt kept Koben close to\ndemonstrate unity with the popular Koben family, or to ensure\nthey could not betray her.\nThe subject of discussion among the clan leaders today\nwas what to do about the continued offshore jade mining by\nthe Anorco corporation. After repeated sabotage of his ships,\nArt Wyles had installed security guards from Jim Sunto’s\nprivate military company, Ganlu Solutions International. Now\nthe vessel off the coast of Euman Island was protected day and\nnight by jade-equipped ex-Espenian military personnel who\ncould Perceive the approach of attackers and drop concussion\ngrenades on them, and technicians who could remove attached\nmines.\n“Invasion and theft!” Koben Yiro declared, pounding the\ntable. “These arrogant foreigners have no respect for our\ncountry or the meaning of jade at all.”\n“No one disagrees with you on that, Koben-jen,” said the\nWeather Man of Six Hands Unity, with a touch of exasperation\nat the dramatics. Hilo couldn’t recall the man’s name offhand,\nbut the chair next to him was empty. The kin killer Jio Somu\nnever left the safety of his own territory in Lukang, even with\nthe assurance of penitents being present. His Weather Man\nsaid, “But the CEO of Anorco, Wyles, has plenty of money\nand political connections and it’s clear he’s not going to be\ndissuaded. The company claims the ships are operating in\ninternational waters.”\n“Lies,” Koben pointed out. “They regularly encroach on\nKekonese territory.”\n“The legalities are ambiguous, but what are we supposed\nto do when the Royal Council wants us to compromise?”\nasked the Pillar of the Jo Sun clan.\nIt was no secret in this room that Green Bones from the\nMountain and No Peak clans had collaborated to damage the"

The politicians in Wisdom Hall were extremely anxious\nabout the escalating situation. So far, no one had been killed,\nbut dead Espenian citizens or dead Green Bones from either\nclan could set off a disastrous diplomatic crisis. The\ngovernment wanted to negotiate an agreement whereby the\nclans agreed to stop attacking the foreign company’s property\nif the Espenians agreed to limit offshore jade mining to certain\nareas and amounts.\nKoben declared, “Only thin-blooded cowards would\nnegotiate with thieves, begging them to steal only some of\nwhat belongs to us instead of all of it!”\nAyt Mada did not rein in Koben for his outspokenness.\nHilo was reminded of shows and concerts where a lesser\nperformer would come on stage first to get the crowd excited\nbefore the main event. Ayt allowed her vocal subordinate to\nrouse people up, so she could then step in and appear all the\nmore the poised commander.\nShe did so now, quieting Koben with a single look before\nsaying, “We would not be in this situation were it not for the\nlong-term coddling of Espenian interests by certain clans in\nthis room.” She fixed Hilo with a steady look of scorn that was\ndeeply familiar to him by now. “Perhaps Kaul Hilo could exert\nsome influence over the disgraceful private military company\nthat guards the offending ships, since he’s personal friends\nwith the founder.”\nHilo said, “Jim Sunto is no friend of mine. If you’re all\nlooking for someone to blame, remember we wouldn’t have\nthe Espenians breathing down our necks if certain other clan\nleaders hadn’t made our country a haven for foreign\ncriminals.”\n“Kaul-jen, Ayt-jen, please,” interjected Chairman Canto\nPan, with admirable bravery, or simply exasperation at how no\nmeeting of the KJA passed without some reminder that after\nall these years, Kaul and Ayt still wanted each other dead. “No\nmatter the circumstances that led us here, let’s focus on the\nRoyal Council’s proposal. What strict limits on offshore\nmining might we accept?”\nIt was remarkable, Hilo thought, how you could get used\nto anything. He would never have believed he could learn to\nstomach regularly being in the same room with the person\nresponsible for the death of his brother, his brother-in-law, and\nso many of his jade warriors—and be bored, even by their\nmutual persistent hatred. While they sat here, No Peak was\nhunting down and killing the leaders of the barukan street\ngang that did dirty work for the Mountain and had carried out\nthe murders of the five Green Bones in Lukang.\nWhat is it going to take to fucking win this thing? Hilo\nseethed quietly as the meeting continued. Could slow,\nsimmering, scattered clan warfare continue forever, past his\nown life? The Pillar of the Mountain was in her fifties—with\nno husband and no children. How long could she hold on to\npower in a clan full of ambitious, younger Green Bones? Why,\nfor the love of all the gods, couldn’t the bitch tire and give up?"

Why,\nfor the love of all the gods, couldn’t the bitch tire and give up?\nAn office assistant that Hilo did not know came up behind\nhim and said in a low, apologetic voice, “Kaul-jen, this\nenvelope arrived for you at the front desk. The man who\ndelivered it insisted that it was urgent and be delivered to you\nat once.” Hilo examined the sealed envelope, but there were\nno identifying marks on the thick stationery. He tore it open.\nInside was a single piece of paper, with no salutation or\nsignature, only one line of typed text. Your life is in danger.\nLeave immediately.\nHilo turned the paper over and looked inside the envelope,\nbut there was nothing else besides the dire warning of the note.\nWordlessly, Hilo handed the paper to Woon beside him. Woon\nwas naturally adept at maintaining a calm, careful demeanor,\nbut his eyes widened, and Hilo saw him glance surreptitiously\nfrom side to side, his jade aura sharpening in suspicion and\nalarm. He looked for the assistant who had delivered the\nenvelope, but the young man had already left the room.\nHilo sent his eyes and Perception sweeping around the\nlarge meeting room. He sensed only the people who were\nsupposed to be there: executives of the Kekon Jade Alliance,\nthe Green Bone clan leaders and their respective Weather Men,\nfour Deitist penitents standing in the corners, two secretaries\nrefilling tea and carrying notes between the meeting\nparticipants. Hilo strained his Perception beyond the closed\ndoors. The hallways directly outside of the room were empty.\nA bored security guard manned the desk in the elevator lobby.\nBeyond that, individual energies became hard to distinguish:\nThe people moving around on the two lower levels of the\nbuilding were a busy blur.\nHe brought his Perception back into the room and scanned\nthe jade auras around him. He Perceived no immediate threat;\nno murderous intent emanated from any of the other Green\nBones, not even Ayt Madashi. The Pillar of the Mountain was\nstaring across the table at Hilo. She could tell that something\nhad happened to put him on high alert. Years of mutual enmity\nhad made both Pillars sensitive to any changes in the other’s\njade aura, and even without accounting for Perception, she\ncould not fail to notice that his focus had left the discussion\nand that for several seconds, he had been sitting very still,\ngazing at nothing.\nHilo turned his head slightly toward Woon. “Take the note\nand leave the room. Quickly.”\nWoon paled. “I can’t leave the Pillar,” he insisted, with\nsuch urgent, fearful vehemence that Hilo remembered Woon\nhad been Lan’s best friend and Pillarman, and had already seen\none Pillar killed under his watch. “I won’t do it, Kaul-jen.”\n“Do as I say,” Hilo ordered him. “Wait in the hallway. I’ll\nbe right behind you. Stop anyone who comes out ahead of me.\nI want you to go first so I know who in this room reacts to you\nleaving. Or if we’re being played for fools.” When Woon still"

Or if we’re being played for fools.” When Woon still\ndid not move, Hilo snarled quietly, “Now, Woon-jen. Think of\nyour daughter.”\nWoon swallowed, then snatched the mysterious paper and\nstood up, striding for the exit of the room. Hilo placed his\nhands on the circular table and stood up more slowly, causing\nthe conversation to falter and come to a standstill. “I’m afraid\nthere’s been a family emergency,” he said. Curious, concerned\nmurmurs rose around the room. “Woon-jen and I have to\nleave. Continue the meeting without us.”\nHilo walked purposefully but not too quickly toward the\ndoor that Woon had pushed through. The jadeless politicians\nand policymakers were merely confused, but a frisson of rising\nsuspicion was traveling through the auras of the Green Bone\nleaders in the room. They could Perceive that Hilo was not\nbeing entirely truthful, that for some other unexplained reason\nhis jade aura was humming at a high and violent pitch. Ayt\nMada turned her head, eyes narrowed, to watch every step of\nHilo’s progress across the room. Hilo’s Perception was so\ntightly strung that his hearing and vision blurred. The room\nseemed to be a dim and silent space filled with individual\nenergies, each of which he held in his attention, expecting at\nleast one of them to react with sudden malicious intent. Show\nyourself.\nOne of them did. In a room crowded full of Green Bone\nauras, it went unnoticed until the last second. Hilo spun around\nas he reached the doors; Ayt Mada had begun to rise from her\nseat. “You’re lying. What are you really—” and from behind\nAyt, the secretary who had begun to refill the Pillar’s water\nglass dropped the jug, spilling water all over the table and\nKoben Yiro’s papers, and in the same motion thrust a knife\nconcealed under her sleeve into the side of Ayt Madashi’s\nneck.\nAyt sensed the attack, but too late. Under ordinary\ncircumstances, no one could imagine an assassin getting close\nenough to cut the throat of a Green Bone like Ayt Mada. It was\nonly because the Mountain Pillar’s attention was entirely\nfocused on Kaul Hilo’s suspicious behavior that the young\nwoman succeeded. In the moment of collective silent shock\nthat hit the room, everyone heard the secretary’s words, a cry\nof high-pitched fear and triumph. “Look at me, Ayt Madashi,\nyou butcher, you bitch. Do you know who I am? Ven Emashan,\ndaughter of Ven Sando, sister of Ven Haku, the girl whose\nfamily—”\nAyt Mada’s hand latched around the girl’s throat in a grip\nof crushing Strength. With an almost inhuman cry, she spun\nand smashed the back of the young woman’s head into the\nedge of the heavy table with so much force that the thick,\npolished black wood cracked along with the girl’s skull.\nBlazing with explosive jade energy, Ayt hurled the limp body\ninto the nearest window.

It hit the glass with a sickening,\nmeaty thud, creating a spiderweb’s pattern of cracks before\ndropping like a heavy sack to the carpet.\nFrom the corners of the room, the watching penitents\nraised their faces upward and chanted in unison, “Heaven has\nseen! Heaven has seen! Heaven has seen!” in a chilling chorus\nthat made everyone in the room quail, tugging on earlobes\nwith the horrible knowledge that Ven Ema had eternally\ndamned her soul and the souls of her entire family for spilling\nblood in sight of the gods.\nAyt fell to her knees, her hands clamped around the wound\nin her neck, red streams pouring between her fingers around\nthe protruding blade. Koben Yiro lurched to his feet in panic.\n“Ayt-jen!” He ran toward her, then stopped and spun around to\nface the stunned, staring faces of all the people in the room.\n“The Pillar’s been wounded. Get help!”\nThe Weather Man of Six Hands Unity took half a dozen\nsteps toward the hall before coming to a hesitant halt. Hilo was\nstanding in front of the closed door. He had not moved; he was\nas shocked as anyone else by the sight of Ayt Mada on her\nknees, fatally wounded, her eyes wide with disbelief and pain.\nAyt’s mouth worked for air. Blood continued to seep out from\nunder her tightly clamped hand, spreading a rich stain down\nher cream-colored cardigan. Hilo stared at her, then slowly\nraised his eyes to the others in the room, sweeping a coolly\nassessing gaze over the meeting’s attendees. Without a word,\nhe took two deliberate steps to block the exit.\nA chilling realization fell across everyone assembled. If\nthey did nothing, Ayt Mada would die. Hilo did not have to lift\na finger to make it happen; he simply had to prevent anyone\nfrom leaving. Several of the people in the room did not wear\njade. Among the other Green Bones present, none were as\nheavily jaded as Kaul Hilo or would individually be a match\nfor him in martial ability. A few of them together could\novercome him, but they were unlikely to be able to do so\nquickly. Woon was out in the hallway and could be at Hilo’s\nside in an instant.\nThe Pillar of the Stone Cup clan sat back down in his chair\nand folded his arms, making it clear that he would not move\nagainst No Peak. The leaders of the Jo Sun clan and the Black\nTail clan followed suit. The Mountain’s tributary clan leaders\nlooked to each uncertainly. They had all sworn oaths of\nallegiance to Ayt Mada, but with the woman bleeding out on\nthe ground and Kaul Hilo standing in their way, was it worth\nrisking their own lives to save her?\nKoben Yiro took a threatening step toward Hilo,\nbellowing, “Someone do something, before it’s too late!”\nHilo settled his predatory gaze on the man. “It’s already\ntoo late, Koben-jen,” he said in a dangerous whisper. “Out\nwith the old, in with the new.”"

If Ayt Mada died, he would be\npersonally saddled with the shame of having failed his Pillar.\nOn the other hand, his nephew was the heir. His family would\nrise to lead the Mountain.\nThree heartbeats of morbid stalemate blanketed the room.\nAyt tried to speak, but although she opened her mouth, no\nwords emerged. Hilo saw the realization dawning on her\nbloodless face. She was dying, surrounded by people, and\nnone of them would help her, not even those allies who had\npledged her their loyalty. Kaul Hiloshudon would stand in\nfront of the door, triumphant, doing nothing, watching her die,\nand everyone else in the room would stand by quietly and do\nthe same. She had been the strongest of them all, the most\ncunning, the most feared, but she was without true friends in\nthis room. Hilo saw this horrible understanding in her eyes,\nand as eager as he was for Ayt to die, in that instant, he felt\npity for her, too.\nRage and defiance lit Ayt Mada’s jade aura, roiling it like\nmagma. With a burst of superhuman effort, she pushed herself\nto her feet and ran—not for the door where Hilo stood in her\nway, but toward the window. She leapt Light over the body of\nVen Ema and threw herself at the damaged glass, hitting it\nwith her shoulder, shattering it with all her Strength.\nWith a snarl of disbelief, Hilo ran forward to see Ayt\ntumble three stories to the sidewalk below. Injured as she was,\nshe managed to cling to her grip on Lightness and Steel. She\ncrashed off the top of a parked van, denting the metal roof,\nrolled off, and landed on the concrete amid a shower of glass\nshards, eliciting shocked shouts and screams from people\nnearby. Ayt rose, staggered and fell, rose again, and began to\nrun, stumbling, down the street.\n“Fuck the gods,” Hilo breathed in astonishment. He\ngathered himself to leap Lightly down after her—thinking\nonly of giving chase and making sure she still died. Then his\neyes landed on the van below. It was parked in a loading zone\nbut there was no one inside. Ayt’s Steeled body had warped\nthe roof and caused one of the doors to buckle so it was\ncracked partway open.\nHilo remembered the note he’d received, the warning that\nhe’d been trying to understand before the attack on Ayt had\nmade him forget the immediacy of some other danger. He took\nseveral steps backward and then the van below the window\ndetonated in an explosion that demolished the ground floor of\nthe building and engulfed the side of the structure in an\nexpanding fireball that traveled faster than the screams of the\npeople it swallowed. Hilo had time only to register disbelief,\nto think of his wife and children, before the force of the blast\nreached him and the third-floor boardroom collapsed, bringing\nhundreds of kilograms of concrete rubble down on him.\nCHAPTER\n26\nNekolva\nT"

Bero had grown up not far from here. When\nhe was a child, the rows of industrial brown living quarters\nhad been populated by dockhands and cannery workers. These\ndays it seemed to be filled with Uwiwan and Oortokon\nimmigrants who worked the city’s lowwage factory and\nservice sector jobs. Bero double-checked the slip of paper and\napproached the door cautiously, glancing up and down the\nstreet. The neighboring unit appeared to be unoccupied; the\nwindows were still taped up against last year’s typhoon\nseason, and the yellow eviction notice on the door was so\nfaded it was not legible. A tarp-covered eight-meter-long\nmotorboat was moored in the water right across from the\nrowhouse.\nBero tried the door. It was locked. He jiggled the knob,\ntrying to judge how hard it would be to break in, when the\ndoor jerked open. The shape of Vastik eya Molovni, with his\nthick arms and curly burnt-orange hair, stood in the dim\nentryway like a demon. Bero jumped back from the foreigner’s\nterrifying glare.\n“What the fuck are you doing here?” Molovni exclaimed.\n“She told me to come here,” Bero blurted. He hadn’t\nexpected to find Molovni here. It was only half past two in the\nafternoon. Wasn’t the Ygutanian supposed to be carrying out\nhis great plan? Weren’t the Espenians supposed to be stopping\nhim? “She told me,” he repeated. “Ema. She said you’d get us\nout of town. She gave me this address.”\nMolovni’s disbelieving stare and the twitch of his heavy\njaw made Bero suspect that the man was debating whether to\nclose the door on him or kill him. Deciding, apparently, that\nneither option—Bero free or Bero as a dead body—was an\nacceptable liability, he swore under his breath in Ygut, seized\nBero by the front of his shirt, and pulled him into the narrow\napartment, shutting the door behind them.\n“Have you told anyone else?” Molovni demanded, pushing\nthe slighter man against the wall with enough force that Bero\nlost any doubt the nekolva agent, though he wore no jade,\npossessed enough Strength to put Bero through the side of the\nbuilding if he wished. “Anyone at all? Any of those other\nclanless fools?” The man spoke in a fast growl, his thick\naccent distorting the words so that Bero didn’t immediately\nunderstand what he was saying. Molovni drew an Ankev\npistol. “Have you?”\n“No!” Bero sputtered. “I haven’t told anyone.”\nMolovni’s brutal face leaned in, close and menacing.

Bero\nwas still not sure if Molovni possessed any sense of\nPerception, but apparently satisfied that Bero was telling the\ntruth, the Ygutanian released him and stowed the Ankev in his\nwaistband. “You can’t come,” Molovni said, scowling at Bero\nas if he were a stray dog in the garbage. “No matter what the\ngirl told you. There’s no room for anyone else.”\n“That’s bullshit,” Bero exclaimed. “You’ve got a boat,\ndon’t you? You can’t fit one extra person?”\n“You are an idiot,” said Molovni. “I’m not talking about\nthe boat. Where do you think we’re to go? There’s a ship\nwaiting on the other side of Gosha Island to take us to Ygutan\nunder asylum. The men on that ship, they will only take the\npeople I’ve told them to expect. You? They will shoot you.”\nSomewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren started up.\nAnother one followed. The Ygutanian locked and bolted the\ndoor behind Bero. “Find your own way out of the city, if\nyou’re trying to run from the clans. Or hide in the apartment\nnext door, I don’t care. But now that you’re here, you can’t\nleave. Not until I’m far away from this fucking island.” He\nturned away from Bero and began to ascend the narrow stairs.\nBero stood stupefied for a minute. Then he followed after\nMolovni. The curtains on the second-floor windows were all\ndrawn shut; only a few slivers of light filtered in between the\ncracks. The room was as spartan as a cell. Bero made out the\nshapes of a single bed, a dresser, a desk and chair. There was\nnothing on the walls, no visible personal belongings besides a\nfew papers on the desk, and a radio.\nMolovni was adjusting the antenna and fiddling with the\ndial of the radio. Classical music skipped to jiggy remix, then\nto static, then to the KNB news radio station.\nBero said, “Where’s Ema?”\nThe Ygutanian didn’t look up. “She’s not coming.”\n“Not coming?” Bero exclaimed. “Where is she? Isn’t she\nsupposed to be meeting up with you?” If the Espenians had\nbeen watching Ema, where had she led them, if not to the\nnekolva agent and his plan?\nMolovni held up a finger to silence Bero and turned up the\nvolume on the radio. Kekon National Broadcasting news\nanchor Toh Kita was delivering a special report: A massive\nexplosion had occurred in the Financial District of Janloon,\ncollapsing the headquarters of the Kekon Jade Alliance during\na board meeting. Dozens of government and clan\nrepresentatives were suspected to be among the dead and\ninjured. Police, emergency workers, and Green Bones of both\nthe major clans were on-site. Toh Kita somberly promised\nlisteners that he would share information as it became\navailable.\n“It’s done.” Molovni checked his watch. “If Guriho and\nOtonyo escape, they’ll be here soon.”\n“You weren’t even there?” Bero felt as if his understanding"

What kind of Ygutanian\nspy are you?”\nThe foreigner wheeled on Bero with a glower of contempt.\n“I did nothing? I spent eight years in this fucking jade-infested\ncity to make this happen. Who arranged everything for the\nclanless? Money, guns, information, explosives, political\nasylum—you think any of these are easy to get?” Molovni\nsnorted. He began to pack items from his desk into a black\nsatchel. “The revolution has to come from within, but it\nwould’ve gotten nowhere if it weren’t for me. If it weren’t for\nnekolva.”\nBero thought of his Espenian handlers and grumbled, “But\nwhy didn’t they stop it?”\nHe realized his slip in an instant, but it was too late.\nMolovni turned back toward him slowly, placing the satchel\ndown on the desk. His small eyes narrowed with suspicion.\n“Who are you talking about?”\nBero fumbled for a convincing lie, but Molovni was\nstalking toward him, his craggy face clouding with suspicion.\nIf he did have a sense of Perception, then he could sense\nBero’s pulse racing. “What have you done, you useless\ncreature?” he growled. “Who are you working for?”\nBero did not get a chance to answer. The windows\nshattered inward at the same time the door was smashed from\nits hinges. The small confines of the room erupted in a storm\nof splintering wood, flying glass, and violent movement.\nBero’s shock lasted for a whole second. Then he dove into a\ncorner of the room as half a dozen masked men in military\ntactical gear burst into Molovni’s apartment.\nMolovni whirled with his Ankev drawn, firing at the\nnearest blackclad intruder. The bullet slammed into the man’s\nbody armor, throwing him against the wall. Molovni got off\none more round before another masked man shot him in the\nback with twin needle-tipped electrical wires that stabbed\nthrough his clothes and into his skin. Molovni went as rigid as\na wooden plank and toppled to the floor, jerking, making\nchoked, guttural noises as electricity poured into his body. His\neyes were furious and panicked, his mouth frozen open in\nrictus. Three men rushed in on the downed Ygutanian like\nwolves.\nEven with his muscles spasming uncontrollably, Molovni\nmanaged to grasp for his jade abilities. He unleashed a\npowerful blast of Deflection that ripped through the apartment\nin a concentric wave. The intruders staggered back and blown\nshards of wood and glass debris pelted Bero’s arms as he\nthrew them over his head. The wires were yanked free of\nMolovni’s back. The Ygutanian rolled to his feet in an instant\nand seized his fallen Ankev. Bero glimpsed the manic fear on\nthe man’s face as he turned the gun toward his own head."

Bero glimpsed the manic fear on\nthe man’s face as he turned the gun toward his own head.\nA booted foot connected with Molovni’s arm, sending the\nweapon flying out of his hand and skittering under the sofa.\nBero had known that Molovni was nekolva, and he’d heard\nof Espenian special operatives who wore jade, but he had\nnever seen men who were not Green Bones move so quickly\nor brutally before. In a desperate final bid to escape through\nthe shattered second-story window, Molovni flew Light across\nthe length of his apartment. He nearly made it, but was seized\nout of the air and borne to the ground by the combined\nStrength of three soldiers. Molovni was pinned like a thrashing\nbull. He screamed profanities in Ygut, spittle flecking the\ncorners of his mouth as his wrists were yanked behind his back\nand secured with tight plastic bindings. His ankles were zip-\ntied together as well, and a black canvas bag was pulled over\nhis head. One of the masked men drew a syringe from a pocket\non his tactical vest and jabbed it into Molovni’s thigh,\ndepressing the plunger. A few seconds later, the man’s\nstruggles grew uncoordinated and feeble, then ceased entirely.\nTwo burly soldiers lifted the unconscious Ygutanian between\nthem like a heavy carpet and carried him from the apartment\nand out of sight.\nBero hadn’t moved from his spot in the corner of the room.\nThe masked men in black ignored him as they began to tear\napart Molovni’s apartment. They pulled open drawers and\ndumped all the contents into yellow evidence sacks. They\nknocked on the walls and floor for hidden compartments,\nlooked under and behind the furniture, and even took the\ngarbage can. They paid special attention to the man’s desk;\nBero saw them place his satchel of papers, an answering\nmachine, and a small stack of unopened mail in a special box.\nThe bottles in the bathroom medicine cabinet were examined,\nphotographed, and likewise gathered and carried out. The few\nwords that the soldiers exchanged with each other were in\nEspenian.\nGalo and Berglund walked into the room, dressed in dark\ncivilian clothes, but armed and officious. Berglund looked\naround at the dismantled apartment with satisfaction and\nbegan to speak to one of the soldiers. The man who had been\nshot in the chest, who would be dead had he not been wearing\nan armored vest, managed to get to his feet with the combined\nsupport of two comrades and was helped from the scene. Bero\ndidn’t realize that the radio on the table was still playing until\none of the Espenian operatives turned it off, unplugged it, and\ncarried it away along with the rest of Vastik eya Molovni’s\nbelongings.\nGalo walked over to Bero in the corner and shook his head\nwith unsurprised disappointment. “You should’ve told us\neverything, Catfish. You didn’t need to be in here.” He offered\nBero a hand up.\nBero stared at the hand without taking it. “You … followed\nme here?” he shouted.\nGalo said, “Did you think we wouldn’t have you under"

It’s a damned good thing we did. As\nundependable of an asset as you are, thanks to you, we have\none of the nekolva in our custody, along with evidence that he\nwas involved in inciting revolution on behalf of the Ygutanian\ngovernment.” Galo surveyed the nearly empty wrecked room\nwith the pleased expression of a leopard licking clean bones.\n“We might finally crack open the secrets of the Ygutanian\nmilitary program.”\nBero got to his feet. “What about Ema? You were going to\nfollow her. Where is she?”\nGalo shook his head. “Sad to say, she was inside the KJA\nbuilding when it collapsed.”\n“You fucking spennies, you didn’t try to stop the great\nstrike of the clanless at all. You just wanted Molovni. You\nknew she was going to be killed.” Bero’s hands were clenched\nand he was shouting again.\nThe Keko-Espenian man eyed Bero severely. “Right now,\nthe ROE Navy is circling the waters around Gosha Island.\nWith any luck, we’ll find and capture the Ygutanian vessel\nwaiting to help Molovni escape. The loss of life from the\nterrorist attack on the KJA building this afternoon was tragic.\nBut if we’d intervened to prevent the bombing, it would’ve\ninstantly tipped off Molovni and his superiors. The stakes\nwere too high. The assets and information we’ve seized from\nour enemies today might save thousands or even millions of\nlives.”\n“Spenny lives,” Bero spat.\n“We tried to get word to our Kekonese allies before the\nbombing, but I’m afraid it wasn’t successful.” Galo squinted at\nBero incredulously. “You joined the Clanless Future\nMovement to take down the clans. You worked for us to earn\nmoney on the side. You’ve accomplished both and come out\nalive. What are you upset about? That the girl sacrificed\nherself for a cause when you were finally getting pussy? Or\nfinding out that you’re not as clever as you think you are? You\nwere manipulated, sure. But what did you expect?”\nEma had given him this address, not so he could escape\nwith her, but to betray Molovni. Just because I hate the clans\ndoesn’t mean I have any love for the Ygutanians. Those had\nbeen her words. She’d wanted to bring down the clans, but\nwould not hand the victory to the foreign agent and his\nmasters. Ema must’ve suspected Bero was a spy, or she’d\nsimply calculated that he would sell the information.\nAnd now she was dead, dead for nothing, just like those\ndumb fucks Cheeky and Mudt and Soradiyo and so many\nothers, and Bero was still alive. At one time, he would’ve been\nsmug. He would’ve seen it as a sign that luck was on his side\neven when it toyed with him.

You’re an asset and I’m\nyour handler. But this one time, I’m giving you advice that’s\nfor your own good.” He gestured out the window. “The leaders\nof the major clans are dead.

The Green Bones will come\nafter anyone associated with the Clanless Future Movement.\nThe Ygutanians or the clanless could find out you led us to\nMolovni. What reason do you have to stay here?”\nBero hated that he had no answer. Maybe he had nothing\nin Janloon, but Janloon had him. Even rats had a sewer to call\nhome, and Janloon was his sewer.\n“You’ve done valuable work for the ROE and earned the\nchance to start life again somewhere else,” Galo said. “Maybe\neven be a different person.”\nThe apartment had been stripped bare except for the\nfurniture. Berglund and one of the remaining soldiers were\nstanding by the door waiting for Galo. Outside, sirens\ncontinued to rise and fall in the distance. Bero thought he\nsmelled smoke. He saw the masked Espenian soldier slide his\nhand down to the military sidearm he carried and glance at\nBerglund, questioning. Galo gave a tiny shake of his head and\nmet his partner’s impassive expression. A brief argument\nseemed to transpire silently between the Espenian agents.\nGalo said to Bero, in an undertone, “I’m helping you out\nhere, Catfish.”\nWith a clarity he hadn’t possessed until now, Bero\nwondered if the Espenians would subdue and abduct him, as\nthey had with Molovni, or simply shoot him. He was a loose\nend, as expendable to them as everyone in the KJA building.\nWith dull, resigned hatred, he said, “Where am I supposed to\ngo?”\nGalo turned toward the door. “Does it matter?”\n“I guess not,” Bero said numbly.

KNB news was showing a scene that Shae did not at\nfirst understand. Only when she read the headline—EXPLOSION\nIN DOWNTOWN JANLOON—did she realize that she was looking\nat the smoking remains of the Kekon Jade Alliance\nheadquarters.\nIt took her another two seconds to remember that there had\nbeen a KJA meeting this afternoon, that the Pillar and the\nacting Weather Man were in attendance. Her mother was\nunaware of this. “Horrible, horrible,” Ria said, shaking her\nhead and sitting down on the edge of the sofa in front of the\ntelevision. “What kind of people would do such a thing? I\nhope that no one we know was inside at the time.”\nShae’s legs swayed. She put a hand out and braced herself\nagainst the back of the nearest chair. Perhaps she was having a\nfeverish, postpartum nightmare. Perhaps she was mistaken\nabout the date of the KJA meeting. Was it really Thirdday\ntoday, not Secondday?\nThe phone in the kitchen rang. She staggered toward it and\npicked it up. It was Juen Nu. “I can’t reach the Pillar.” The\nHorn’s words, and the awful pause that followed them,\nshattered her denial. “Do you know if he was inside that\nbuilding?”\nShae heard her own shallow breathing, and her voice,\nalarmingly weak. “I think so.”\nSilence from the other end of the line. Then the Horn said,\n“Stay where you are, Shae-jen. I’ll send more Green Bones to\nthe house, and all the rest I can spare to help the emergency\nworkers. I’ll call again as soon as I learn anything more.”\nAnother terrible, leaden pause. “Do you have anything you\nwant to say to the clan, if you must?”\n“Not yet,” Shae said. “Not until we know who did this.”\nShe had no doubt that whoever was responsible for the\nexplosion had meant to kill all the Green Bone clan leaders at\nonce, but she wasn’t ready to think that her brother and her\nhusband were both dead, and that she was now the Pillar of the\nclan and a widowed single mother. “Someone needs to tell\nWen,” she said. “And the children. Someone has to tell …”\nShe trailed off, unable to finish the sentence because it had\nbecome hard to breathe. She pressed a hand to her chest. Her\nheart was thudding hard and irregularly.\n“I’ll send people to find Wen right away,” Juen said. “And\nI’ll have Fingers pick up Niko and Jaya at the Academy, and\nRu from his school, and bring them all back to the house.”\nAfter Juen hung up, Shae said to her mother, “Ma,” but\ncouldn’t manage to say anything else.

She held her\ngranddaughter close. “This is because of what happened\ndowntown, that explosion,” she said. “You have to go to work\nfor the clan, even now.” When Shae nodded without\nelaborating, her mother’s face trembled. “Is it very bad for\nus?”\n“I don’t know yet.” Shae tried to speak calmly, to not give\nanything away. “Just … wait here, and don’t believe anything\nyou hear, not until I find out for sure.”\nA deadened understanding came into her mother’s eyes, an\nexpression of powerlessness that would’ve broken Shae’s heart\nif she was not already too full of dread. Kaul Wan Ria had\nbeen through this before. She had waited alone to hear of the\ndeath of her husband. Then her eldest son. And now her\nsecond son as well.\nShae knew she ought to do as Juen said, she ought to stay\nin the house where it was safe and wait for news, as her\nmother was resigned to do. She couldn’t do that. She needed to\ngo there, to see for herself, to know for certain. If she was\ntruly the Pillar now, she had to be seen among the clan. She\ncould not be a woman lying in her bedroom with an infant.\nShae ordered one of the estate’s guards to drive her into the\nFinancial District. Traffic was extremely slow all the way\ndown the General’s Ride. Several blocks away from the scene\nof disaster, they could go no farther. The roads were cordoned\noff and blocked by police cars and fire trucks. Crowds of\npeople were on the sidewalks, pointing and muttering, holding\nscarves and the hems of their shirts over their noses to cut the\npervasive stench of burning and the haze of ash in the air.\nGreen Bones of both the major clans and some minor ones\nwere everywhere, talking to each other, trying to calm\nconcerned Lantern Men and hurry people away from the\ndisaster zone, their rivalries forgotten for the time being."

Chaos flowed around her: movement, noise, smoke,\njade energies—all of it an assault against her senses. Her eyes\nand throat were stinging. She moved too quickly for anyone to\nstop and recognize her. No one was paying attention anyway.\nIt took Shae twenty minutes to plow her way to the center of\nthe activity. She was sweating and gasping by then, her hair\nand clothes covered in a fine layer of ash. Half of the building\nwas still standing, obscenely intact, hallways and rooms laid\nopen to the sky like an architect’s model cut open to show the\nlayout of the interior. The southern half of the structure was a\ncollapsed pile of concrete and twisted metal around a crater of\ndestruction. A line of trees and two buildings on the other side\nof the street were blackened, scorched from the blast. Suited\nfirefighters were swarming the site, and ambulances were\npulling up, one after the other. Shae saw a line of injured\npeople—with bleeding head wounds, burns, broken or\nsprained limbs—sitting or lying on the sidewalk, being triaged\nand attended to by medics. She turned in a circle, dazed and\noverwhelmed.\nShe followed her sense of Perception toward a familiar\ncluster of jade auras and found Lott Jin, the clan’s First Fist of\nJanloon, organizing a group of roughly fifty of No Peak’s\nGreen Bones. They were all wearing work gloves, scarves\nwrapped around their faces, and red plastic whistles around\ntheir necks. “Vin and Tato are leading the two search teams\nstarting at opposite ends of the collapsed area and working\ntoward each other,” Lott shouted. “If you sense a survivor,\ndon’t spend your own Strength; we need you to focus all your\nefforts on Perception and keep moving. Send up long whistles\nat ten second intervals and stay at the site until firefighters or\nsomeone from one of the digging teams reaches you. Batto,\nYan, and Toyi—you have the best Lightness here. You’re\ngoing to carry water, medical supplies, and messages. Does\neveryone understand?” When the grimly assembled Fists and\nFingers nodded, Lott said, “The Mountain is here too. Work\nwith them, but remember: We search every square meter\nourselves. If you Perceive Kaul-jen, or Woon-jen, send up\nthree short whistle blasts in a row. For them and no one else.”\nLott’s men touched their clasped hands to their foreheads\nin salute and the group broke up into purposeful activity. “May\nthe gods shine favor on No Peak,” several of them murmured"

Shae went up to Lott, causing him to spin in\nsurprise.\n“Kaul-jen,” he exclaimed in angry surprise, forgetting his\nrespect in the heat of the moment. “What are you doing here?”\n“I wasn’t learning a godsdamned thing sitting in the house\nwatching the news.” Shae wiped a hand across her brow,\nstreaking it with dust. “What—” She put a hand to her chest\nand caught a tight, difficult breath. “What do you know about\nwhat happened? Who was responsible? Is there any …” She\nlooked toward the destroyed building and the rescue crews\nswarming around it. “… Any sign of survivors, yet?”\nLott shook his head. “It’s a confused mess right now,” he\nsaid. “Juen-jen is talking to the police. We know the blast\ncame from a truck full of high order explosives parked in a\npermit-only zone on the south side of the building, directly\nunderneath where the KJA meeting was taking place. The\nbombers had inside knowledge. They knew the layout of the\nbuilding, its security measures, and when the meeting was\ntaking place. There are witnesses who say they saw two men\nin the truck this morning. And some people swear they saw\nAyt Madashi fall from a window right before the explosion.\nThe Mountain’s people are searching the area, but they don’t\nhave any more answers than we do.”\nShae coughed and said, “What can I do to help?”\nLott looked at her in concern. “Kaul-jen,” he said. “You\ndon’t look well.”\n“I’m fine,” Shae said. Lott did not appear convinced. Shae\nimagined how she must appear to him—a forty-one-year-old\nwoman, lacking most of her jade, weak from childbirth—and\nshe suffered a surge of frustration and resentment, more\ntoward herself than Lott. She felt foolish and helpless, not at\nall like a Green Bone or a Kaul or a Weather Man. What had\nshe imagined she could accomplish here? “I need to be here. I\nneed to know.” She meant to sound declarative, but the words\ncame out wretched. “My brother and my husband are in that\npile of rubble.”\nLott said, with conviction, “I promise on my jade that\nwe’ll find them.” The First Fist put a hand on her elbow and\nwalked with her to one of the clan’s cars, parked alongside the\nline of emergency vehicles. “The clan needs you to preserve\nyour strength. Only the gods know what’s in store for us after\nthis.” He opened the passenger-side door for her and handed\nher a bottle of water from a flat of them sitting on the ground\nnext to a pile of blankets. “It’s not my place to ask you to\nleave, but at least sit down and rest.”\nLott left her sitting in the car with the door open.

She\nwas in no state to make decisions on behalf of No Peak, but\nshe might soon have to. She watched the rescue efforts with\nsick fear in the pit of her stomach. Startled Fists and Fingers\nsaluted when they passed her, but she was largely ignored.\nInjured people were seen to, others were driven away in\nambulances. Whenever a whistle went up from the searchers,\nher heart leapt, but each time, it was a single long whistle, not\nthe three short blasts she kept waiting for. More frequent than\nthe survivors came the bodies, carried out of the rubble and\nplaced in black body bags on the ground.\nShae got out of the car and walked numbly down the\nstreet. She couldn’t bear to feel so useless, even though Lott\nwas correct and she was in no shape to be exerting herself\nphysically in the heavy wreckage and dust-choked air. No one\nnoticed her leaving the scene. Maybe she should’ve stayed at\nhome after all. Wen would’ve heard the news by now. Niko,\nRu, and Jaya had been pulled out of school and she ought to be\nthere to meet them when they got home. Her breasts were\nbeginning to feel uncomfortably hard and swollen, and she\nrealized she’d forgotten to tell her mother where the diapers\nwere stored.\nShae’s feet carried her through the eerily abandoned streets\nof the Financial District, and out of unthinking habit rather\nthan any conscious decision, she found herself three blocks\naway, standing outside the Temple of Divine Return. The\ncourtyard with its prayer trees was empty and silent. Even the\nwind seemed to have fallen still. Shae walked through the\ndoors. The platform in front of the mural of Banishment and\nReturn was empty. It seemed that in the immediate aftermath\nof such an unprecedented attack in the heart of Janloon, every\nnearby building had been evacuated, even the temple. The\nsight was disquieting. Over the years, she’d come to this place\nhundreds of times, sometimes early in the morning before\nwork, sometimes late at night, but no matter the time of day,\nthere had always been penitents sitting in dutiful meditation,\neyes closed, hands resting on sacred orbs of jade, their auras a\ncrooning hum of peaceful but vigilant energy filling the\nsanctum. Now that energy was absent, and she was alone.\nThat was not true. Shae’s sense of Perception was foggy,\nnot what it would normally be, but as she walked slowly down\nthe aisle between the prayer cushions, she felt a tug on her\nsenses, the flicker of an undeniably familiar aura. She turned\naround, slowly, disbelieving. Her eyes slid into the shadows at\nthe back of the chamber and came to rest on a figure slumped\nagainst the back wall, unmoving.\nShae walked toward the hunched shape. The rough sound\nof her own breath and the tread of her shoes against the floor\nseemed intrusive, deafening. That dense red jade aura—she\nwould recognize it anywhere.

Ayt Mada lay with\nboth hands pressed over the wound in her neck, her arms and\nshoulders caked with drying blood, her chest barely rising.\nAt Shae’s approach, Ayt’s eyes cracked open and gradually\nfocused. A long surreal moment of mutual astonishment\nstretched between the two women. Then a slow, ironic smile\nlifted the corners of Ayt Mada’s mouth and crawled across her\nglazed but glittering eyes. “Truly, the gods do have a sense of\nhumor.” Ayt’s voice was barely audible. “Kaul Shae-jen. What\na coincidence.”\nShae lifted her face to the ceiling of the empty temple,\nwhere she and Ayt had met in years past, under the eyes of the\ngods in Heaven, to stake themselves irrevocably against each\nother. She brought her gaze back to the woman at her feet.\n“Perhaps not such a coincidence, Ayt-jen,” she whispered.\nAyt rasped, “Your brother is dead. I wasn’t even in the\nbuilding, and the explosion threw me across the street.” The\nmatter-of-factness of Ayt’s words chilled Shae to the soles of\nher feet. It was remarkable that the woman had survived her\nwounds, that she had managed, somehow, to stagger the\ndistance to the temple, where perhaps she’d hoped to find aid\nand sanctuary. Shae took a few steps closer. Ayt’s face was as\npale as chalk, and her lips were turning blue. The stiffly curled\nfingers of her hands were white. Ayt had been Channeling into\nherself, a difficult feat for any Green Bone. She had clotted the\ngrievous wound in her neck and slowed the bleeding by\nredirecting and spending her own life energy, drawing it from\nelsewhere in her body. It was an unsustainable tactic, like a\nstarving man eating his own flesh. She would lose function\nelsewhere, go numb in her extremities and limbs, black out as\nher organs shut down.\n“Who did it?” Shae was genuinely curious, almost bitterly\nadmiring. Decades of murderous hatred between No Peak and\nthe Mountain, and someone else had plunged a knife into Ayt’s\nneck.\n“I did,” Ayt answered. She smiled again at Shae’s\nuncomprehending silence. “I executed Ven Sando and his sons\nfor treason ten years ago. But I let his wife and daughters\nlive.” Ayt’s voice was a slurred, dry, acidic whisper. “It wasn’t\nenough for Ven’s daughter that I die in the bombing. She\nwanted me to know it was her. I made the error of\nunderestimating another woman.” The Pillar wetted her lips\nand fixed her eyes on Shae. “I’ve only done that one other\ntime.”\nShae looked down at her family’s mortal enemy, the\nwoman who was ultimately responsible for so much of the\npain that had defined Shae’s adult life. The murder of her\nbrother Lan, the clan war, the loss of much of Shae’s jade and\nher near death in a clean-bladed duel, the car bombing that had\nkilled Maik Kehn, Tau Maro’s treason and execution, the death"

The list of everything\nthat Ayt had inflicted upon No Peak went on and on, each one\nan ugly scar on Shae’s soul.\nShe glanced at the empty platform at the front of the\nsanctum. Today, of all days, there were no penitents present to\nwitness what happened in the temple and report the deeds to\nHeaven. Her hand moved to the small of her back, to the talon\nknife that she carried sheathed there. She drew it with the\nbone-deep certainty that the gods had turned their faces away\non purpose, like sneaky relatives slipping a child a gift they\nshould not be approving. The weapon settled in her hand,\nwarm and solid with purpose. Her clan, her family, her life\nmight be in ruins—but she had this. It was up to her now, to\nfinish what her brothers could not, to finally end the war\nbetween the clans. Perhaps Lan was watching. Perhaps Hilo\nwas as well.\nShae crouched warily. Ayt might be fatally wounded and\nclose to death, but a tiger in a trap could use its dying breath to\nrip out one’s throat. Ayt was wearing far more jade than Shae\nwas, and might summon one last surge of vindictive willpower\nto take an enemy down with her.\nAyt shifted painfully. “I congratulate you, Kaul-jen. By\ntonight, you might be the only Pillar left standing in Kekon. I\ndon’t envy you.” The scornful smile was gone from her face.\nShe sounded weary and angry. “A word of advice: Don’t ever\nmake the mistake that I did. Don’t show mercy.”\nShae stilled. Ayt’s words, filled with grim portent, seemed\nto add weight to the knife in her hand. You might be the only\nPillar left.\nThe clans had fought each other for years. Yet it was a\ndifferent enemy who had struck today, intent on destroying all\nthe Green Bone clans at once. The extremists did not care\nabout aisho, about killing hundreds of innocent people. They\nwanted to upend Kekonese society altogether, to sow chaos\nand destruction, to prove that even the country’s most\nimportant institutions were vulnerable and even the strongest\nGreen Bone leaders could be killed by people who had none of\ntheir powers.\nShe had seen the rubble left by the bombing, and as much\nas she wanted to deny it, she knew that what Ayt had said was\nlikely true: The people in that building were dead. She saw\nclearly now what would happen. The minor clans would be\nthrown into crisis by the loss of their Pillars. Entire towns and\nindustries would be cast into disarray. The country would look\nto the two major clans for direction. Ayt Mada’s twenty-two-\nyear-old nephew would become Pillar, and the Mountain clan\nwould fall under the rule of the imprudent Koben family. The\nKobens would blame immigrants and foreigners for the\nterrorist attack.

They would whip people into a reactionary\nfrenzy and wield all the Mountain’s influence over the Royal\nCouncil to push for isolationist policies that would reverse the\ncountry’s decades of growth, threaten No Peak’s international\noperations, and provoke foreign aggression.\nAs for No Peak … Shae felt cold apprehension deep in the\nmarrow of her bones. She was a new mother, likely a widow,\nphysically unwell, and without most of her jade. She was in no\ncondition to be Pillar. She did not want to be Pillar. The idea\nfilled her with horror.\nWas this how Hilo had felt, she wondered, on the night of\nLan’s death? She’d never truly spoken to him about it. It\nwould be even worse for her, trying to lead No Peak, and\nperhaps the country itself, in the aftermath of a national\ndisaster, with the other Green Bone clans in chaos and the\npeople howling for retribution, while outside powers crouched,\nready to sweep into the turmoil.\nShe tightened the grip on her talon knife. Ayt’s eyes were\nlidded; her jade aura pulsed with feeble impatience, even as\nher breathing grew increasingly labored and shallow.\nShae made a noise under her breath and stowed her\nweapon. Without believing what she was doing, she moved to\nAyt Mada’s side and put a supporting arm under her back,\nsitting the other woman up. She put additional pressure on the\nseeping neck wound and began Channeling her precious\nenergy, forcing warmth into Ayt’s body.\nDon’t show mercy. “It would be a mercy to cut your throat,\nAytjen,” she hissed, “and spare you from being the Pillar at\nthis awful time when you’re most needed.”\nCHAPTER\n28\nMake Your Choice\nA\nnden had been through shocking events in his life, but not\nin his wildest imagination could he have envisioned his cousin\nKaul Shae emerging from the back of the Temple of Divine\nReturn with Ayt Mada’s arm over her shoulder, both of them\nstaggering, covered in Ayt’s blood.\nFor several seconds, Anden stared in openmouthed horror\nand astonishment, unable to make sense of the impossible\nsight. Recovering himself, he got out of the car and went to\nhelp. When he reached them, he hesitated, drawing away from\nAyt as if instinctively avoiding a viper. Then he put a hand\nunder the injured woman’s other arm and opened the rear door\nof the car, helping Shae to lay her down in the back.\nShae dropped into the front passenger seat. Anden got\nback into the driver’s side. He turned to Shae with wide,\nquestioning eyes. The Weather Man looked terrible. Ash\ncoated her hair and darkened the film of sweat on her face so\nthat she looked nearly as gray as a corpse herself.\n“Shae-jen,” Anden said slowly, “why exactly are we\nsaving the life of Ayt Madashi?”\n“We need her,” Shae answered grimly. “The city needs her.\nThis would be the worst time for the country’s largest clan to\nfall into chaos, or to the Koben family, which might be nearly\nas bad.” She read the stricken question in Anden’s eyes, and"

Have you?”\nAnden shook his head. “I’ve checked with all the\nhospitals.” Shae had reached him at the clinic in Paw-Paw\nwhere he’d been working, dealing with the influx of injured\npeople overwhelming Janloon’s medical facilities. In between\nrushing around caring for patients, he’d been alternately\nphoning the main Kaul house, Shae’s house, the Horn’s house,\nthe Weather Man’s office—trying to find out if the rest of the\nfamily was safe. The phone lines were jammed; it was sheer\nluck that Shae had gotten through to him on a pay phone\noutside the temple after only three attempts. He was still in\nmedical scrubs and wearing his jade, having rushed out\nimmediately without telling anyone.\nAnden glanced over his shoulder into the rear seat of his\nRyuna 5T Wagon, an eminently practical vehicle that Hilo had\nteased him about, but whose nondescriptness he was now\nthankful for as it would be the last car anyone would think to\nscrutinize if they were searching for the Pillar of the Mountain.\nAyt Mada was breathing, but not moving. “The bomb site is\nonly a few blocks away and there are ambulances and\nMountain clan Green Bones there,” Anden said. “Or should\nwe take her straight to Janloon General?”\n“Neither,” Ayt said, with enough vehemence that Anden\nflinched at the voice of his family’s mortal enemy coming\nfrom directly behind his shoulder. “No one in the Mountain\ncan see me like this. Do you understand?” Ayt took a rattling\nbreath and tried to sit up. “I … I need to get back my strength\nfirst …”\n“You need a doctor, Ayt-jen,” Anden said. “You’ve lost too\nmuch blood.”\n“Enough that I might die of my injuries within an hour of\nbeing found. Get me away from everyone.” The demand in\nAyt’s voice was laced with an emotion that Anden did not\nrecognize at first: fear. It took him a moment to understand.\nThere might be members of the Mountain clan, ardent\nsupporters of the Koben family, or those who nursed a long\ngrudge for the rivals Ayt had killed over the years, who would\nnot be unhappy if the Pillar turned out to be simply another\nunfortunate casualty of today’s heinous attacks. Even in a\nhospital under the care of her own Green Bones, in her weak\nand vulnerable state, Ayt could not be certain of her safety.\nCursing silently to himself, Anden wiped the grit from his\nglasses, then started the car and began to drive. Fortunately,\nthe roads were empty—he’d managed to get through the\nsecurity cordon around the disaster area only because he was a\ndoctor—so it took less than fifteen minutes for him to reach\nthe only place he could think of to go: his own apartment in\nOld Town.

When they arrived, he pulled his car into the\nunderground parking lot and parked next to the elevator,\nsending Shae ahead to make sure they wouldn’t run into\nanyone in the hallway. Anden had a raincoat in his trunk,\nwhich he threw over Ayt’s shoulders, pulling the hood over her\nhead to hide her face. The Mountain Pillar was barely\nconscious; her aura was feeble, and she could not stand on her\nown. Anden lifted her easily in his arms and carried her into\nthe elevator, then down the hall into his apartment. The Pillar’s\narms dangled, the multitude of gemstones on her body bright\nagainst pale skin, their energy creating a climbing pressure in\nAnden’s head and chest. It was the most unreal thing he\ncould’ve imagined: the formidable Ayt Madashi, laid so low,\nhelpless in his arms.\nOnce inside, Anden laid Ayt down on the sofa and stood\nback, wiping his brow, which was covered with sweat from\nanxiety rather than exertion. Shae locked and deadbolted the\ndoor and drew the window blinds. For a second, the two of\nthem stood in the darkened living room, breathing hard and\nstaring at Ayt and each other in disbelief. Then Anden let out a\ntense breath. “Shae-jen, can you help me? I need the first aid\nkit from under the bathroom sink, and also, could you boil a\npot of water?”\nShae nodded and went to do as he asked. Anden knelt next\nto the unconscious Ayt and ran his Perception through her\nbody, making quick note of the worst injuries. Placing his\nhands over her torso, he began Channeling into her, slowly and\nsteadily, so as not to overload her weakened system. The\nimmediate problem was blood loss; he set to work shutting\ndown the bleeding from the ugly stab wound as well as the\ninvisible internal bleeding from physical trauma, likely\nsustained from falling out of the building or being thrown by\nthe explosion. By the time Shae returned with the bandages\nand hot water, he’d gotten the worst of it under control, but\nthat hardly meant Ayt would live. Blood pressure was still\nalarmingly low; circulation was extremely poor; dehydration\nand infection were distinct possibilities. He couldn’t do any\nmore until he got equipment and supplies from the clinic\nwithout rousing suspicion.\nHe gave his jade abilities a needed rest while he cleaned\nand stitched the knife wound. He’d already been exerting\nhimself at the clinic and didn’t have enough energy to keep\nChanneling without exhaustion. Shae hovered nearby, then\nwent into the kitchen. Anden could hear her using the phone.\nAfter a few minutes, she came back into the living room. “I’m\ngoing back to the house for a while,” she said. “The kids are\nthere now, and Wen is on her way. And I need to feed Tia.”\n“Sit down for a few minutes, first, Shae-jen,” Anden\ninsisted. “You need to eat and drink something, and I’ll check\nyour heart and lungs before you go. You can’t afford to cause\nany harm to yourself.”\nShae glanced at Ayt on the sofa. “You have enough to deal\nwith. Save your own energy.”\n“You think I care about Ayt Mada’s life?” Anden"

Save your own energy.”\n“You think I care about Ayt Mada’s life?” Anden\ndemanded, more harshly than he’d intended. “I’ll treat her on\nyour orders, but I’m not going to put her life over yours.”\nAnden went into the kitchen and made two bowls of\ninstant soup laden with as much protein as he could find in his\ncupboard and fridge—wheat noodles, boiled eggs, seaweed,\nand shredded dried fish—and made his cousin sit and eat with\nhim. Shae turned on the television. Every news channel was\nreporting the breaking news that two men implicated in the\nbombing of the Kekon Jade Alliance building had been killed\nin a shootout with police. A tip from an unidentified source\nhad unexpectedly led to the Docks, where Guriho and Otonyo\n—Oortokon-born ex-convicts and leaders of the Clanless\nFuture Movement—were found attempting to escape the city\nby boat. Guriho had gone down in a furious exchange of\ngunfire, and Otonyo had shot himself before he could be\napprehended.\nThe bombers were being hailed as heroes by violent\nsupporters who’d incited a wave of smaller attacks in the wake\nof the bombing. Gunmen waving the black flag of the clanless\nand chanting, “The future is now! The future is clanless!” had\nattacked government institutions and prominent clan-owned\nproperties in the city. Green Bones of the Haedo Shield clan\nwere staunchly protecting the Kekon Treasury and Wisdom\nHall, but there were reports of weapons fired, tear gas\ngrenades and pipe bombs set off near the Factory, on Poor\nMan’s Road, and in the Financial District. Shae sucked in a\nsharp breath at the sight of the lower floor of the No Peak\ntower on Ship Street wreathed in smoke.\nThe news returned to Toh Kita in the KNB studio, who\nreported that the current casualty toll from the KJA bombing\nrested at eightyseven dead, a hundred and twenty-two\nwounded, and sixty-four missing, including the Pillars of both\nthe No Peak and Mountain clans. Confirmed dead included the\nchairman of the KJA, the Pillars of the Jo Sun and Black Tail\nclans, and the well-known Mountain Green Bone Koben Yiro.\nToh Kita read a statement released by young Ayt Atosho\non behalf of the Mountain clan. It expressed shock and grief,\npraised the work of the rescue workers, and declared that\nanyone, domestic or foreign, connected to the unconscionable\nacts of terrorism was a sworn enemy of the Mountain clan and\nthe entire country. Aisho did not apply to those who dared to\nstrike at the very fabric of Kekonese society. The Mountain\nwould come down from the forest to destroy the Clanless\nFuture Movement and anyone who aided it.\nThere had been no statement yet from the No Peak clan,\nToh Kita told the viewers. Anden glanced at Shae worriedly.\nThe Mountain’s announcement was surprising not for its\ncontent but for its swiftness.

Ayt Mada’s body had not been\nfound, but the Koben family was hurrying to ensure that the\nfirst official clan communication positioned Ayt Ato as the\nnew Pillar—no doubt to dissuade other influential families in\nthe Mountain who might consider challenging for the\nleadership. Now that the Mountain had spoken, however, it\nwould not be long before No Peak was expected to do the\nsame.\n“I should go,” she said. Anden suggested she phone the\nhouse and have bodyguards come pick her up. He didn’t like\nthe thought of his cousin going out alone given the threat of\nongoing violence, nor the idea of her exerting herself further,\nbut Shae argued that they couldn’t risk any Green Bones in the\nclan Perceiving Ayt in his apartment. Anden still frowned with\nconcern, but Shae’s breathing and heartbeat were both normal\nenough that he called her a taxi and gave her a travel thermos\nof tea with a tincture to help her respiratory system.\nOnce the Weather Man had departed, Anden turned off the\ntelevision. He could not bear to see the photographs of Kaul\nHilo and Ayt Mada on-screen with the words MISSING\nunderneath them, not when the one lying on his sofa, the one\nwhose life he might be able to save, was not the right one. He\nwatched Ayt’s shallowly rising chest, her eyes twitching\nbeneath her closed lids. He knew he ought to take a nap and\nregain his strength, but he didn’t think he could sleep. He was\ntoo amped up with nerves and worry, and it seemed ludicrous\nto fall asleep in the same room with his family’s worst enemy,\nno matter how little danger she seemed to pose. Anden sighed,\nand stretched out his jade abilities once again, sliding his own\nenergy into Ayt’s body, encouraging it to speed up production\nof plasma and red blood cells.\nAyt sensed him. Her eyes slitted partway open and settled\non Anden. “Do you remember when we first met, Emery\nAnden?” the Pillar asked hoarsely. “Gont Asch brought you to\nsee me. You were a frightened teenager, but you conducted\nyourself like a man. I knew then that you would become an\nasset to the Kauls.” Ayt’s bloodless lips lifted humorlessly. “At\ndifferent times, I considered having you killed. Now I’m glad\nyou never forced me to do so.”\n“You should save your strength, Ayt-jen,” Anden said.\n“There’s no need to talk.”\n_______\nShae was gone all evening. During that time, Anden hurriedly\ndrove to the clinic where he worked and snuck out two bags of\nIV fluid along with a tube and stand, wound dressings, and\nantibiotics. He did so as quickly as possible and without\ntalking to anyone. Even though Ayt was asleep, the thought of\nleaving the Pillar of the Mountain alone in his apartment was\nso strange that he didn’t want to do it at all, but there was no\nchoice. It didn’t matter how much of his own energy he\nChanneled into Ayt to mitigate the effect of her injuries, none\nof it would matter if he didn’t get fluids into her and stave off\ninfection."

Her skin was\nnot as ashen as it had been, and she appeared to be breathing\neasier. Anden thought he ought to clean the blood off her, give\nher a new shirt to wear—but the thought of undressing Ayt\nmade his mind recoil like a poked oyster. He set up the\nintravenous tube and said, “Ayt-jen, I need to start a drip, and\nalso change your bandages.” Ayt did not open her eyes, but her\naura gave enough of a stir to suggest she’d heard him and\nunderstood. He didn’t want to startle her awake and have her\nreact to a needle jab in her arm by tearing his throat out. At the\nsame time, he felt silly for still fearing her. She was a badly\nwounded middle-aged woman, not a demon.\nAnden turned the television back on and watched the news\nwhile resting and regaining his strength in between bouts of\nChanneling. Footage continued of emergency workers and\nGreen Bones digging through the rubble of the collapsed KJA\nbuilding with headlamps and flashlights. Confirmed casualty\nfigures were updated on the bottom of the television screen\nwhen they were received. A reporter managed to get in front\nof a grimy, sweaty Juen Nu and ask him if he still hoped to\nfind his Pillar alive. The Horn of No Peak was normally a\nfactual man, known for being clear-eyed and unsentimental,\nbut he glared at the reporter and snapped that Green Bones\ndidn’t rely on hope so long as action remained to be taken, and\neverything would go faster if the media got out of the way and\nlet them work.\nAnden picked up the phone. He dialed the number for the\nmain house but stopped at the last digit, his finger hovering\nover the button, the dial tone droning in his ear. He pictured\nthe rest of the family together in the living room, or perhaps in\nthe sparingly used prayer room, waiting for news. Wen, even\nin the grip of unbearable dread, would still be calmly telling\nthe children that their father wouldn’t want them to panic. Ru\nand Jaya would be scared and asking questions, but Niko\nwould be quiet, holding his fear inside. Anden couldn’t think\nof anything to say to them that would be of any reassurance.\nCalling would only tie up the phone line when it needed to be\nkept free. And how could he bear to lie to his family, to\nfabricate an excuse for why he wasn’t at the house with them\nright now because he was secretly caring for Ayt Mada?\nWith a heavy heart, he set the receiver back into its cradle.\nHe would’ve thought that under the circumstances, he\nwouldn’t be able to relax enough to fall asleep, but the sheer\nexhaustion from worry and expending jade energy turned out\nto be too great. He dozed off in the armchair still wearing his\njade and was jolted awake by the sudden Perception of two\nGreen Bones approaching his apartment door. One of the jade\nauras belonged to Shae.

Anden opened the\ndoor before Shae knocked. Standing behind the Weather Man\nwas a tall, elderly man, thin and grizzled, nearly bald, but with\npiercingly clear eyes and jade carried on weathered leather\nbands around his left wrist.\n“I’m sorry I took so long getting back,” Shae said. “This is\nNau Suen.”\nAnden had never met the former Horn of the Mountain in\nperson. Most of Nau’s time as the military leader of the enemy\nclan had occurred while Anden had been living abroad in\nEspenia, and then while he was ensconced in medical school.\nHowever, he knew of Nau’s reputation as a devious assassin\nwith a frightening level of Perception, well trusted by Ayt\nMada whenever she whispered names. Even though the old\nman in the hallway had retired from his post years ago and\nwas not physically formidable, Anden swallowed and touched\nhis forehead warily as he held open the door. “Nau-jen,” he\nsaid.\nNau stepped inside the apartment wordlessly and with\nbarely a glance at Anden. He crouched down beside the sofa\nwhere Ayt Mada was now awake and weakly trying to push\nherself up into a sitting position. The former Horn put a gentle\nhand on Ayt Mada’s forehead, as if she were a child with a\nfever.\n“Hello, old friend,” Ayt said with a rueful smile. “Come to\nbail me out again.”\n“Kaul Shae was the one who came to me,” Nau admitted\nin a grumble. “Otherwise, I would’ve thought you were in that\npile of rubble. That’s what people have been saying, even the\nKobens.”\nAyt slid a look over her former Horn’s shoulder, glancing\nat Shae with an expression that Anden thought was not\ngratitude, exactly, but bemused acknowledgment. “How\ndisappointed some people are going to be,” she said, implicitly\nincluding both clans in the statement.\nNau touched the thick bandages over Ayt’s neck. “How did\nthis happen?”\n“Ven’s daughter,” Ayt explained bitterly. “Disguised as a\nsecretary, and striking at the right moment.”\nNau hissed a breath through his teeth. “Mada,” he sighed.\n“Do you remember that I told you not to leave any of that\nfamily alive? We’re both getting old, and our enemies are still\nyoung.”\n“At least you’re retired, Suen-jen,” Ayt said, with a wry\nlightness in her voice that Anden would never have imagined\ncoming from her. Ayt pulled the IV tube from her arm and put\nher feet down on the ground, pushing herself off the sofa in an\nattempt to stand. She swayed alarmingly and nearly fell. Nau\ncaught her around the shoulders and supported her weight. She\nleaned against him, sweat breaking out on her face. The old\nHorn lifted her in his arms, his lined face tensing for a\nmoment, but his Strength was still more than enough to handle\nthe burden. Ayt put her jade-adorned arms around Nau’s neck"

Ayt put her jade-adorned arms around Nau’s neck\nand rested her head against his shoulder, breathing heavily.\n“Get me home,” she muttered.\nAnden and Shae stood to the side as Nau walked toward\nthe door. Before he reached it, Anden came out of his stunned\nstate and said, “Wait.” He took a plastic grocery bag from the\nkitchen and filled it with the extra bandages and a pill bottle of\nantibiotics. The phone on the counter rang. Shae picked it up.\nAnden handed the bag to Nau, who held it hanging\nawkwardly off one wrist as he carried Ayt. “Change the\nbandages every four hours, and take two pills each day.” He\nmet Nau’s gaze. “Your Pillar needs a blood transfusion and\nshould be in the hospital. At least have a Green Bone doctor\ntreating and monitoring her.”\nNau did not take his eyes off Anden’s face. “May the gods\nshine favor on you for what you’ve done, Dr. Emery Anden,”\nhe said. “Even though I know you’ve never saved a life more\nunwillingly.”\nIn that instant, Shae’s jade aura pulsed with emotion strong\nenough that both men turned toward the Weather Man. The\nphone receiver slid from Shae’s grasp, dangling on its cord as\nshe steadied herself with both hands on the edge of the\ncounter. Anden’s heart seemed to stop in his chest. One second\nelongated into an eternity.\nShae looked up at him, eyes damp with relief. “They’ve\nbeen found,” she breathed. “They’re alive.”\nAnden’s eyes flicked toward the television. It had been\nplaying on mute, but the screen was no longer recycling the\nsame clips. Now it was showing stretchers being carried into\nan ambulance. The camera was too far away for Anden to\nmake out faces or details, but the line of text at the bottom of\nthe screen read, NO PEAK CLAN PILLAR AND SEALGIVER FOUND\nALIVE.\nAnden went light-headed. His knees weakened and he put\na hand on the back of the sofa. He’d never considered himself\nespecially religious, but now he whispered devoutly, “Yatto,\nFather of All, Old Uncle Jenshu and all gods in Heaven, thank\nyou.”\nOnly because he was still wearing his jade did he notice\nthe tension that charged the room in the instant that followed.\nNau Suen’s eyes were also on the television. His normally\nunreadable jade aura darkened and swelled in Anden’s\nPerception.\nAs soon as Shae had uttered, They’re alive, everything had\nchanged.\nFor Kekon to lose the Pillars of both major clans in one\nblow was too great a national crisis. Shae had saved Ayt’s life\nfearing that without her the entire country could be\ndestabilized. However, if Kaul Hilo was alive, then he was still\nthe Pillar of No Peak.

If Ayt were to die now, the Mountain would\nbe thrown into turmoil, while No Peak remained intact. The\nKauls would win.\nSlowly, Nau shifted his unblinking gaze to Anden, who\nwas standing between him and the door of the apartment. The\nformer Horn of the Mountain had been a feared man, but even\nin his prime, he’d never been the most physically intimidating\nwarrior. He defeated others with cunning and skill. Nau was an\nold man now, and Ayt was too weakened from her injuries to\nwalk, much less fight. Shae and Anden were younger and\nstronger than the other two Green Bones. And Anden was\nwearing all his jade.\nHe could feel Nau’s knife-like sense of Perception raking\nover him, gauging his intent, even as he sensed in Nau’s jade\naura a bitter readiness. The old man was prepared to fight, to\ndie defending his Pillar and to take at least one of the Kauls\nwith him. No one in the KJA building had been willing to do\nthe same, not even the late Koben Yiro.\nAnden remained where he was, standing in front of the\nwoman who’d been his family’s enemy for twenty years. He\ncould do it. He was tired, but he had enough Strength to strike\na deadly blow or Channel a lethal strike.\n“Anden,” Shae whispered, low and urgent. He didn’t look\nat his cousin.\nNau shifted Ayt in his arms, preparing to set her down.\nInstead, the Pillar of the Mountain put her feet on the ground\nand stood under her own power, steadying herself on the\nshoulder of her former Horn, but straightening to her full\nheight. She glanced at the news on the television and\ncommented, with bitter humor, “I can’t begin to tell you how\nmany times I’ve wondered why Kaul Hilo isn’t dead yet, and\nit seems I’m destined to keep wondering.” Sweat stood out on\nher brow but her expression was iron in its calm as she looked\nat Anden. “Make your choice, Dr. Emery.”\nAnden could Perceive every heartbeat in the room, most of\nall his own. A pressure built in his chest, his jade energy\ncompressed. He’d sworn to himself that he would never use\njade to take lives again. But he could never have imagined this\nmoment.\nHe would willingly sacrifice his medical career if it meant\nthe Mountain couldn’t harm anyone he cared about ever again.\nWould killing the woman he’d spent the last day working so\nhard to heal accomplish that? If he could end the war between\nthe clans for good, how many more lives would that save in\nthe future? Was it worth breaking his personal oath? Would it\nbe what Lan wanted him to do?\nSeconds passed, unnaturally long. Anden’s hands curled\ninto fists at his side. Without taking his eyes off Ayt and Nau,\nhe stepped out of the way and opened the front door. Nau\nSuen’s stare flickered and his face twitched. He shifted to\nsupport his Pillar, and the two of them walked through the\ndoor, down the hall and out of sight. Anden watched them go,"

Anden watched them go,\nstanding in the doorway until he could no longer Perceive\nthem.\n“Did I choose wrong?” He whispered the question to\nhimself.\nShae slumped against the wall. “I have no idea.”\nCHAPTER\n29\nRude Awakenings\nK\naul Hilo and Woon Papi were rushed to Janloon General\nHospital, where they remained for over two weeks, with the\nclan’s Fists guarding them continuously. Hilo suffered a\nconcussion, a shattered scapula, ruptured spleen, burns, and\ncontusions. Woon was bedridden with several broken ribs and\na fractured pelvis, and he’d lost the hearing in one ear. By the\ntime they’d been found and dug out of the rubble, both men\nwere also badly dehydrated. That they had survived when\nmany other people in the building had not, including other\nheavily jaded Green Bone leaders, was widely spoken of as a\nmiracle and a sign of the gods’ protection.\nThere was no miracle, Hilo explained, once he was lucid\nenough for conversation. Years ago, Hilo had asked the ex–\nNavy Angel Jim Sunto to teach him and all the top Green\nBones of No Peak the Espenian IBJCS techniques against\nIEDs. Traditional Steeling techniques concentrated on the\nbones and the surface of the body, to ward against blows and\nblades. The most lethal effect of a nearby explosion, however,\nwas the overpressurization of vital organs, particularly the\nlungs, intestines, eyes, and ears. The instant he’d realized what\nwas happening, Hilo had Steeled for his life, concentrating all\nof his formidable jade energy inward, into his own head and\ntorso, battening the pressure-sensitive parts of his body first,\nthen pushing jade energy outward to protect against blunt\ntrauma as he was thrown through the air, as he put it, “like a\ncat tossed into a fucking typhoon.” Woon, too, had attended\nSunto’s IBJCS training sessions, and although his ability in\nSteeling was not as great as the Pillar’s, he was already out in\nthe hallway and thus farther away from the explosion; his\ninjuries had been sustained by the building collapsing on top\nof them.\nShae took her baby daughter into her husband’s hospital\nroom. Woon was groggy with painkillers, but his eyes went\nsoft with relief and happiness to see them. “While I was\ntrapped in the dark, I kept thinking I might never see you or\nTia again,” he said to Shae. “I knew Hilo-jen was still alive,\nbecause I could Perceive him somewhere nearby, so I didn’t\nlose all hope, but it was a terrible feeling.”\nShae choked up at the sight of his injuries. “I feel as if\neverything bad that’s ever happened to you is my fault.” She\nwondered, not for the first time, if she was cursed to bring\ndisaster to anyone who came too close to her.\nWoon shook his head and reached for her hand. “I’ve been\nthe Pillarman, and the Weather Man’s Shadow, and the"

In truth, that’s where I’ve always felt most\nuseful. I’m grateful the gods put me exactly where I needed to\nbe. On any other day, it would’ve been you in that room.”\nShae placed Tia in Woon’s arms. The baby stirred but did\nnot wake. So far, she was a calm infant, so much so that\nsuperstitious Green Bone families might be a little worried.\n“She’s eating well and gaining weight,” Shae said, “but she\ndoesn’t cry much.”\n“That’s good,” Woon said, cradling their daughter. “The\nKaul family has enough thick-blooded warriors. I’ll be glad if\nshe takes some of my personality, since she already looks so\nmuch like you.”\nShae sat beside Woon, feeling full of heavy, vaguely\nanxious gratitude, until he fell asleep. Then she nursed and\nchanged Tia, and walked a short way down the hospital\ncorridor to her brother’s room.\nDays after being dug out of the rubble, Hilo still looked\nterrible, with bandages covering much of his body, but he was\nsitting up in bed, eating a bowl of pureed fruit and saying\ncheerfully to Niko, Ru, and Jaya, “At least my face still looks\ngood. You wouldn’t want your da to look like a ghoul, right?\nDon’t worry, I’ll be home soon. Remember to help out your\nma and don’t give her any trouble while I’m in here.”\nThe boys nodded solemnly, and Jaya threw her arms\ntightly around her father’s neck. He winced at the impact and\ngently loosened her grip, then said, “All right, you’ve missed\nenough school for one week. Lott-jen will drive you back.”\nHis sons and daughter left with bodyguards surrounding them.\nWen remained in the chair by Hilo’s side. Juen Nu came in\nfrom the hallway and closed the door behind him.\nWith the children out of the room, Hilo’s bright facade\ndropped and he glared up at Shae. “I still can’t believe you\nsaved Ayt.” Word had spread that Ayt Mada had reappeared at\nher residence in High Ground and was shut away inside\nrecovering, surrounded by her loyalists, including Nau Suen\nand her Weather Man, Iwe Kalundo. “I saw her with a knife in\nher neck,” Hilo exclaimed, his voice rising. “You of all people,\nShae. All you had to do was walk the fuck away.”\nStill cradling a sleeping Tia in her arms, Shae took the only\nother chair in the room, on the other side of the bed across\nfrom Wen. “I thought you were dead, Hilo,” she said,\nunmoved by his ire. “Along with dozens of Green Bone\nleaders and government officials. Without Ayt as well, the\ncountry would’ve fallen into chaos.”\n“It’s come close enough as it is,” grumbled Juen. The Horn\nlooked as if he hadn’t showered or shaved in days. As soon as"

As soon as\nHilo and Woon had been found, he’d turned his attention to\ndealing with the insurrectionist violence. In the immediate\naftermath of the attack, with the clan leaders missing and so\nmany Green Bones busy digging through the rubble for\nsurvivors, several loosely coordinated cells of armed\nextremists had heeded the Clanless Future Movement’s call to\nrebellion and taken to the streets.\nThe Royal Council, fearing all the Green Bone Pillars to be\ndead and the clans in disarray, had called three thousand\nnational military troops into Janloon, including the jade-\nequipped Golden Spider Company. Juen said, “I hate to admit\nit, but we’re lucky that the government ordered soldiers into\nthe city and bought us time to get our shit together. No one\nexpected the CFM to be so well armed. We suspected they\nwere relying on foreign support, but not to this extent.”\n“At least all the money and resources we gave to General\nRonu turned out to be of some use.” Hilo glowered and leaned\nhis head back against the pillows for a moment, clearly\nfatigued even from being awake and doing simple things.\n“This is even worse than the time I was in here after getting\nthe shit beaten out of me by Gont Asch. At least, that time, I\nwoke up in the hospital to good news.”\n“Everyone suspects Ygutan was involved,” Shae said.\n“Euman Naval Base is on high alert, which suggests the ROE\nthinks so too.”\nHilo grimaced and closed his eyes. “A note was delivered\nto me during the KJA meeting, warning me to get out. There\nwas no sign of who sent it, but now I’m guessing it came from\nthe Espenians.”\nWen squeezed her husband’s hand. “Why didn’t you\nlisten?”\n“As soon as I stood up, everyone in the room knew\nsomething was wrong. I sent Woon ahead of me, making an\nexcuse about a family emergency. I thought the threat was\nfrom inside, that maybe Ayt had something to do with it.” Hilo\nopened his eyes again. They glittered with fury. “If the\nEspenians sent that note, then they knew the bombing would\nhappen. They could’ve saved everyone in the building, but\nthey didn’t.”\nJuen spat a curse. “Those two-faced foreign dogs likely\nwanted the anarchists to start a rebellion. It would’ve given\nthem the perfect excuse to take control of Kekon by sending in\ntheir own troops to restore order.”\nShae said, with a pensive frown, “I’m sure they were\nprepared to do so, but I don’t think that was their goal.\nConsidering the conflicts over the naval base, jade exports,\nand offshore mining, it’s no surprise the Espenians have no\nlove for the clans, especially the Mountain. But if they warned\nHilo, then they hoped to keep him and No Peak alive.” She\nshifted Tia to her other arm, holding her sleeping daughter\nclose. “Remember, the Espenians tackle problems with money\nbefore violence.

We\ndon’t owe the spennies a sack of shit.” He picked at a bandage\non his chest; some of his jade had been temporarily removed\nand his aura was uncharacteristically scratchy and uneven. He\nkept touching the bare spots where his jade was missing, like a\nman compulsively trying to locate an amputated limb.\nWen caught hold of his hand and stopped him from\nundoing the dressings. “We all wish Ayt had died,” she said,\n“but the Weather Man has a good point. A country with two\nlarge clans is less likely to be controlled, manipulated, or\ndestabilized right now.”\n“Fuck all those self-serving, scheming foreigners with\nsharp sticks,” Hilo growled, “but not right now. We’ve got a\nmess to clean up first. The clanless fanatics wanted an uprising\nso badly, they let their movement get hijacked by outsiders.\nNow they’ve fucked themselves. The government, the press,\nthe public—they’ll all be baying for us to spill blood.”\nJuen nodded as he paced back and forth near the foot of\nthe bed. “There were only two new attacks yesterday. Killing\nyou and Ayt was the one thing the anarchists most needed, and\nfinding out that you were both still alive was a terrible blow.\nSome of them are already giving up and trying to disappear.\nAfter we get the streets back under control, we’ll need to act\nfast to wipe out as much of that organization as we can before\nit scurries underground again.”\nThe Horn stopped his pacing and turned to the Pillar with\ngrim shame and regret on his face. “We didn’t treat the\nclanless as a serious enough threat before. No one did. I’ve\nbeen talking to Aben Soro about coordinating our actions\nagainst them from now on. I don’t think he’s Ayt’s man in\nquite the same way Nau and Gont were. We can work with\nhim.”\n“Pull in the minor clans as well, whichever ones are still\nable to function.” Hilo took a minute to gather his breath and\nregain his energy. He pointed to the glass of water and package\nof painkillers on the bedside table, which Wen handed to him.\n“I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but get some journalists\nin here too. The Kobens already put out a statement and I keep\nseeing Koben Yiro’s weepy widow on TV, holding that old\ngasbag up as a martyr. The sooner people see proof that I’m\nnot dead or in a coma, the better.”\n“What are you planning to say?” Shae asked, a bit\napprehensively.\n“Only what the Clanless Future Movement is going to find\nout soon enough.” Hilo swallowed two pills with his water.\n“Anyone who thinks they can get rid of us so easily deserves"

He was in here because of that\nlittle worm, that man with the crooked face. If only he’d\nbroken the rat’s neck and then killed himself, as he’d been\ntrained to do.\nHe’d also been trained to resist interrogation. “You won’t\nget useful information from me,” he growled. “My superiors\nwould never tell me military secrets so important they would\nharm Ygutan even if I were to break under your torture.”\nDespite his brave defiance, he erupted into a cold sweat and\nhis heart rate rose precipitously.\n“You have the wrong idea,” said the other of his captors.\n“The ROE military has a policy against torture.

At that time, there were no large clans such as\nthe country has today, only many small, local family clans\nthroughout the island that kept their own jade and fighting\nmethods and protected their own communities. The visionary\nfounding masters established Wie Lon to produce the island’s\nmost skilled and disciplined warriors while schooling them in\narts, sciences, and the traditions of the Deitist faith. They built\ntheir institution in the interior mountainous region of Kekon,\nwhere students could train close to nature and the gods, far\nfrom the concerns of common people.

Over the following\ncenturies, Green Bone warriors developed into an increasingly\nprominent and influential social class, its members bound by\ncommon training methods and connections that can largely be\ntraced back to the original Wie Lon Temple School. Today,\nKekon boasts over a dozen schools of martial study, and while\nthe more recently established Kaul Dushuron Academy rivals\nWie Lon in size and prestige, the historical mystique of the\nWie Lon name remains second to none.\nThe school’s current campus, located sixty-five kilometers\nwest of Janloon, was established after the Many Nations War\nby merging three separate, secret training locations that\noperated during the foreign occupation of Kekon after the\noriginal Wie Lon Temple School was burned to the ground by\nShotarian soldiers. During the destruction, nearly a hundred\nmasters and novices who tried to defend the school were\ncaptured, stripped of jade, imprisoned, tortured, and executed.\nAmong those that escaped the purge was a sixteen-year-old\ntrainee named Ayt Yugontin, who led a group of younger\nstudents away from the assault and into the forest where they\nhid from the enemy while their school and home burned all\nnight, sending plumes of black smoke high into the air. In the\nmorning, they fled into the wilderness ahead of Shotarian\nsearchers, until they were found by scouts from the local\nresistance cell of the One Mountain Society. Ayt Yu, who\nwould later become known as the Spear of Kekon, stood\nprotectively in front of the crying, exhausted group of children\nand demanded to know the name and clan of the scouting\nparty’s leader.\n“My name is Kaul Seningtun,” answered the scout, “and\nthe name of my clan doesn’t matter anymore. All Green Bones\nin these mountains are brothers.”\nCHAPTER\n30\nThe Bad Keck\nthe nineteenth year, third month\nD\nauk Losunyin passed away from heart failure at the age of\nseventysix, leaving behind his wife, four grown children, six\ngrandchildren, and the unofficial post as Pillar of Southtrap,\nwhich he’d held for so long. Anden and Hilo traveled to Port\nMassy for the funeral, to pay their respects as allies of the\nDauk family and the Keko-Espenian Green Bone community.\nOn the long flight over, Hilo watched a movie, then had a\nglass of hoji and fell asleep. Anden tried to follow his cousin’s\nexample, but he couldn’t concentrate enough to read nor calm\nhis mind enough to drift off. He found it hard to believe that\nDauk was gone. It didn’t seem that long ago that he sat in the\nman’s dining room, eating Sana’s home-cooked meals along\nwith Cory and Rohn Toro.\nAnden’s sadness was compounded with worry. There were\nno clans in Espenia; people called Dauk the Pillar simply out\nof respect for his personal influence. With no formal\norganization or plan of succession, Dauk’s death would not\nonly change who held sway among Green Bones in Espenia,\nbut possibly the very nature of the Keko-Espenian community,\nin ways that were certain to affect the No Peak clan."

Brittle, frost-coated grass crunched under\nAnden’s shoes, and his breath steamed in the sunlight. Over\nthe view of Whitting Bay, the harsh black lines of the Iron Eye\nBridge cut across a milkwhite sky. In accordance with Dauk’s\nwishes, the funeral was traditionally Kekonese, with certain\nmodifications and additions of Espenian custom. There were\nno Deitist penitents in Port Massy senior enough to be\nordained as Learned Ones, but three lay penitents from the\nlocal community temple, dressed in green hats and scarves, led\nthe attendees in the proper recitations that would usher Dauk’s\nspirit into the afterlife to await the Return. Afterward,\nEspenian mourning songs were sung and people gave\nspeeches, many of them telling stories of the Pillar’s character\nand how he’d assisted them in a time of need. Anden got up to\ndeliver a bilingual address that began in a personal way,\nrecounting how warmly and generously Dauk Losun had\nwelcomed him into the community when he’d first arrived as a\nstudent, but ended on a more formal note, conveying the\nregards and condolences of the Kaul family.\n“That was nicely said, Andy,” Hilo told him afterward.\nAnden stood near his cousin and made introductions as\nfuneral-goers came up to meet the Pillar of No Peak, saluting\nhim or shaking his hand with nervous awe and curiosity before\nwithdrawing to observe from a distance, as if he were a\ndisguised media celebrity. Hilo accepted the respect-paying\nbut maintained a somberness befitting the occasion, standing\nnear the back of the gathering so as not to detract from the\nattention due to the grieving family. With his jade hidden\nbeneath a black suit and tie and a long black wool coat, he\ncould’ve passed as a visiting distant relative. The white\nenvelope he placed in the collection plate by Dauk’s casket\nwas stamped with the insignia of the No Peak clan and was\nsure to cover all the funeral expenses.\nAfter Dauk was laid to rest, a reception was held in the\nKekonese community center, where for decades the Pillar of\nSouthtrap had presided over the neighborhood grudge hall.\nAnden hadn’t been inside the place in years, but he was struck\nby how essentially unchanged it was, despite being tastefully\nmade up for the event. The walls were draped with white cloth\nand the tables that normally surrounded the cockfighting ring\nin the basement had been brought up and dressed with\ntablecloths and adorned with vases of white azaleas. The\nbattered bookshelves and lumpy armchairs that ordinarily\noccupied the common area had been pushed into the corners\nand hidden from view behind painted folding screens. Lit\nincense candles and platters of fruit crowded the space in front\nof the small Deitist shrine.\n“Ah, I miss this old neighborhood,” lamented Mr. Hian,\nwho now resided in the suburbs with his younger son. “Where\nI live now, there are no Kekonese newspapers in the library,"

You know how proud he\nalways was to be a Green Bone from the old country.”\n“The only thing he was more proud of were his\ngrandchildren, I think.” Anden had never ceased to find\ninteractions with his old boyfriend to be tinged with a certain\nnostalgia and awkwardness, but enough time had passed for\nboth of them that their conversations were amicable. Cory was\nmarried now, with a cherubic two-year-old son and a baby\ndaughter on the way. He’d put on some weight but was still in\ngood shape from cycling on the weekends, and he cheerfully\nadmitted to have grown his short beard so as to appear more\nintimidating when arguing in front of a judge. His wife was a\nsecond-generation Keko-Espenian social worker, six years\nyounger than him. They’d met during one of his court cases.\nThey seemed happy together.\nCory’s sisters were there as well, of course. Although he\nhadn’t forgotten how coldly she’d rebuffed his family’s offer\nof friendship in the past, Anden greeted Kelly Dauk politely\nand introduced her to Hilo, who made no issue of her prior\nrudeness and said amiably, “Ms. Dauk, your mother tells me\nyou recently started a new job.” Cory’s eldest sister had been\nplucked from the Industry Department to chair the federal\nAnti-Corruption Panel, whose purpose was to investigate and\nroot out political graft and ties to organized crime.\n“I’m not at liberty to discuss my work, Mr. Kaul,” the\nwoman replied. “Not even with my family and friends, much\nless to a Kekonese clan boss.” She made a brisk social circuit\naround the gathering, then left the reception shortly thereafter.\nHilo did not seem offended, but Cory was apologetic for\nhis sister’s behavior. “Kelly works for the government, after\nall,” he reminded them with a sigh. “She doesn’t want to be\nseen associating with Green Bones.”\nThere were, indeed, many Green Bones in attendance. The\nroom was becoming so crowded that Anden could barely\nmove. It seemed as if half the Kekonese population of the city\nwas here. He recognized Tod and Sammy and several others,\nbut there were many younger people from Southtrap that he\ndidn’t know, and some who’d come from other parts of the\ncountry.\nAn hour into the event, a silver limousine pulled up in\nfront of the building. Jon Remi stepped out with three of his\nmen, all of them wearing light-colored sport jackets, polished\nshoes, and big sunglasses like typical southern gangsters.\nTheir entrance caused heads to turn.

Anden felt a surge of\ndistaste rise sour in the back of his throat. Remi’s flippant\ncrudeness, which Anden remembered all too well from that\nevening in the Blue Olive, seemed even more pronounced now\nthat he dripped with wealth. His hair was slicked back from\nhis tanned face, accentuating his strong brow and dark lips,\nparted with curious scorn.\nThe Crew Bosses and Tomascian drug lords in Resville\ncalled Jon Remi “the Bad Keck,” a title he’d embraced. After\nusing No Peak jade and money to run the Mountain out of the\ncity, Remi had built his own small empire. He’d taken over his\nuncle’s gym years ago and become a key figure in the\ngambling that accompanied that city’s unsanctioned jadesports\nindustry. In addition to dealing in shine and women, he’d\nexpanded into other businesses normally controlled by the\nCrews, including loansharking and extortion. His men were\nnotoriously vicious; Remi awarded them jade for carrying out\nassassinations against his rivals.\nThe opinion in Port Massy was that the Bad Keck was a\nvolatile troublemaker and not a proper Green Bone at all. Even\nwithout his sense of Perception, Anden could feel the palpable\nunease ripple through the room as conversations died and\npeople backed out of the path of the Resville men.\nRemi strode up to Hilo, slowing and taking off his\nsunglasses as he neared. “So old man Dauk’s finally left us for\nHeaven,” he said in Espenian, “but the famous Kaul\nHiloshudon has come to earth to visit us instead.” Remi\nstopped, studying Hilo the way a dog watches a stranger\napproaching its door—tense, ready to bark. The Pillar returned\nthe younger man’s gaze with steady, motionless expectation.\nSeveral seconds passed before Remi brought his clasped\nhands to his forehead and dipped into a shallow salute. “How\ndoes the saying in the old country go?” In accented Kekonese,\n“May the gods shine favor on you, Kaul-jen.”\nAnden went to the Pillar’s side. “Hilo-jen, this is Remi\nJonjunin, our friend from Resville. Forgive his poor Kekonese\nand awkward manners. I’m sure he’s only nervous and means\nno disrespect.”\nThe Bad Keck began to turn toward Anden, his expression\ndarkening with insult. Anden hoped savagely that the man\nwould do something stupid. He’d like to see Hilo put the\ngangster in his place, or better yet, break his jaw. But Hilo\nsettled a hand on the man’s shoulder as if they were old\nfriends. “Remi-jen, I feel as if I know you already, having\nheard so much of your reputation. Go offer your condolences\nto the wife and children of Dauk Losun—let the gods\nrecognize him—and we’ll talk about business tomorrow, when\nit’s more appropriate to do so.”\nTod appeared next to them and said with forced\nconviviality, “I’ll let Sana know you’re here, Jon. What’ll you"

What’ll you\nhave to drink?”\nRemi seemed perplexed for a moment. Perhaps he’d built\nKaul Hilo up in his mind over many years of being told he was\none of the most dangerous men back in Kekon, and now he\nwasn’t sure how to respond to a benign meeting. Remi snorted\nand said to Tod, with a shrug, “Hoji, even though I hate the\nstuff. In honor of the old man, right?”\nHe strode away without giving Hilo or Anden another\nglance. His men followed. As soon as they were out of earshot\nand normal conversation had started up again, Hilo turned to\nAnden with a stern look. “What’s the matter with you, Andy?”\n“He’s a boor and a gangster, Hilo-jen,” Anden replied with\nheat. “He was obviously trying to goad you, here at Dauk-jen’s\nfuneral in front of everyone. He has no respect for anything.”\n“Don’t show off how much you hate a man until you’re\nready to be his enemy,” Hilo admonished. “Remi’s away from\nhis own city where he’s grown powerful, and he’s the sort of\nman to act badly to prove his confidence. Even if he’s not a\ngood person, don’t forget he’s done everything we wanted\nagainst the Mountain.”\nJon Remi and his gang, the Snakeheads, had indeed been\ninvaluable to No Peak. After multiple setbacks, the Mountain’s\nentry into Espenia never recovered. Iwe Kalundo, Ayt’s\nWeather Man, had turned his clan’s expansion priorities firmly\non Shotar instead. Nearly twenty years after Anden had first\ncome to Port Massy, No Peak remained the only Kekonese\nclan with substantial power in the Republic of Espenia.\nYet the clan had still not achieved the legal security it\nneeded to preserve the business, and now, without Dauk\nLosun’s influential friendship, accomplishing anything in the\ncountry would be much harder. Hilo watched the Resville\nGreen Bones, their pale jackets easy to pick out at the bar.\nAnden felt the smooth edge of Hilo’s jade aura swell\nmomentarily. “Jon Remi is our ally until I say otherwise,” the\nPillar said in an undertone. “Whether it stays that way is up to\nhim. We’ll see how things go tomorrow.”\n_______\nUpon returning to their room in the Crestwood Hotel, Hilo\nsaid, “It’s fucking cold in here.” He took off his suit jacket and\ntie and shrugged into a sweater, then turned up the heat in the\nroom. Anden had heard his cousin complain before that cold\nmade his shoulder ache and sometimes his wrist as well. Years\nspent fighting took a heavy toll on the body, even before\naccounting for the injuries Hilo had sustained in the Janloon\nbombing. Surgery to stitch his spleen and repair his scapula\nhad been followed by months of physiotherapy before he\ncould train again. Five years later, the Pillar appeared fully\nrecovered, as strong a Green Bone as ever, but Anden knew\nthat even the best healers and trainers could only do so much."

Five years later, the Pillar appeared fully\nrecovered, as strong a Green Bone as ever, but Anden knew\nthat even the best healers and trainers could only do so much.\nThose who were close to Hilo noticed the moments when he\nmoved without his usual grace or winced at some lingering\npain.\nAnden said, “I’m going downstairs to the gift shop, to pick\nup some small things for coworkers at the clinic.” It was a tiny\nlie, and if Hilo Perceived it, he didn’t say.\nAnden took the elevator down to the ground floor and used\na calling card to place a long-distance phone call from one of\nthe pay phones at the back of the lobby. When the call picked\nup, Anden said, “I’m glad I caught you before you went to\nwork.” It would be just past dawn in Janloon, and Jirhuya was\nan early riser.\n“I’m not in a rush,” Jirhu said. “I’m waiting for the\ndirector to get back to me on the budget anyway. So I’m\nenjoying breakfast and then going to the gym.” Kekon’s\ngrowing film industry, financed by the No Peak clan, had\ngiven the artist steady work for several years. Anden heard the\nsound of running water shut off in the background, then a\npause. With sly suggestiveness, “Too bad you’re not here with\nme.”\n“I wish I were,” Anden said. “We need to stay a little\nlonger to deal with some clan things. I’ll be back on\nFourthday.” He couldn’t hear Jirhu’s reply because at that\nmoment a large group of people passed through the hotel\nlobby, and Anden had to cover his other ear to block out their\nloud chatter. “Sorry, it’s noisy here. What did you say?”\n“Will you be okay?” It was the only thing Jirhuya ever\nasked when it came to Anden’s activities on behalf of No\nPeak. Jirhu had no wish to have anything to do with the clans\nbeyond day-to-day life in Janloon. He knew Anden’s world\ninvolved jade and money, politics and bloodshed, on a level\neven ordinary Kekonese did not understand, much less an\nAbukei artist. His only concern when it came to clan dealings\nwas Anden’s safety.\nWen had introduced them to each other ten months ago.\n“Anden,” she’d said after dinner at the Kaul house one\nevening, taking his empty plate and drawing him into the\nkitchen, “are you free for lunch next Secondday? I’d like you\nto meet a friend of mine. He’s a talented artist who works in\nthe film industry. Also, he’s handsome and single.” She held\nup a hand before he could even think of what to say. “Just so\nyou know, he’s Abukei, but don’t judge him until you meet\nhim. I think the two of you would get along. I’ll set it up so\nthere’s no pressure.”\nAnden had been rendered nearly speechless with\nembarrassment by the idea of Wen considering partners for\nhim.

Lott Jin had gotten\nmarried to a woman Anden didn’t know, then divorced three\nyears later. He seemed uninterested in another relationship—\nnot that Anden was holding out any hope on that front. On\noccasion, Anden had gone to social gatherings with the few\nqueer friends he’d met in medical school and at work, but he\nwas wary of creating professional complications. There were\nno other mixed-blood Green Bone physicians in all of Janloon.\nAnden could not hide who he was or where he was seen, even\nif he wanted to. And most men with the unlucky desire for\nother men did not want to risk the potential public scrutiny that\ncame from associating with the Kaul family.\n“How do you even know he would be interested?” Anden\nasked.\n“Just come to lunch,” Wen assured him.\nAnden had been skeptical. He had no particular attraction\nto Abukei men and had never before contemplated dating one.\nSo he was surprised at that first meeting, then faintly resentful\nof Wen’s smugness. Jirhuya had sharp cheekbones, smooth\nbronze skin, and a slim, straight build that made all clothes\nlook good on his body. He used this fact to his advantage and\nwas always well dressed, even when he was only going out for\na short while. Although he didn’t possess the physique of a\nfighter that Anden had always associated with male beauty,\nhe’d grown up swimming and rock climbing and now kept up\nboth activities in the gym. Jirhu possessed a ready smile and\nwas easy to talk to because he was quick to open up about\nhimself and genuinely curious about others. In that way, he\nreminded Anden of Cory, but Jirhu had a rich inner life—one\nawash with colors and ideas and feelings—that Anden didn’t\nfully understand, and the man was more intensely devoted to\nhis artistic vocation than Cory had been to anything. Anden\nwas shocked, after their first few dates, to find himself the\npursuer—calling Jirhu to invite him over, making dinner,\nrenting movies.\nA clicking on the line told Anden he was running out of\ntime on his calling card. “We’re just having a meeting\ntomorrow. There’s nothing to worry about,” Anden assured his\nboyfriend. That was not true; meetings could decide life or\ndeath, war or peace, but that was not what Jirhu was asking.\nThey talked a little longer. After hanging up, Anden did indeed\ngo into the hotel gift shop, where he bought some bags of sour\ncandies and keychains shaped like the Mast Building. He\ncould’ve saved himself the minor inconvenience by simply\nusing the phone in the hotel room, but he hadn’t yet mentioned\nhis boyfriend to the Pillar. Even though Hilo probably already\nknew about the relationship, Anden wasn’t sure how to\nproperly bring up the subject.

Cory and\nhis sisters were all financially secure, so the Dauks had\nbecome reasonably wealthy in their later years. Instead of\ndownsizing, they’d built a much larger, nicer residence where\nthey could host gatherings and have their children and\ngrandchildren visit. They were not technically in Southtrap\nanymore, but they didn’t need to be, as the neighborhood was\nincreasingly being taken over by high-rent commercial space,\nand the Kekonese community had spread out over the years,\nwith old K-Town remaining in Southtrap, but equally populous\ncultural pockets cropping up in Jons Island and Quince, among\nother places.\nThe meeting was held at a long mahogany table in the\ndining room. It was a far cry from the cozy space Anden\nremembered of the Dauks’ old blue split-level house. Tea was\npoured and plates of snacks were passed around, which gave\nthe gathering the incongruous feel of a family gathering, even\nthough there were people in the room who’d never met one\nanother and others who outright disliked each other. Dauk\nSana, in a white sweater and face powder, sat at the head of\nthe table with her son, Cory, the only Green Bone among her\nchildren, seated beside her.\nNext to Cory was Etto Samishun, who Anden had known\nas Sammy when they were both young men. Now people\ncalled him Etto-jen and acknowledged him as the most capable\nGreen Bone remaining in Southtrap. Sammy and a few other\nprotégés of the late Rohn Toro were the leaders of a loose\nnetwork of several dozen Green Bones that continued to\nprotect the neighborhood and had remained loyal to Dauk\nLosun as Pillar until his passing.\nAnother familiar face at the table was Shun Todorho. Tod\nwas an honorably discharged Navy Angels corporal and\nOortokon war veteran who’d battled drug addiction and\ndepression upon leaving the military, losing three jobs and a\nmarriage before Dauk Losun stepped in and gave him work in\nthe grudge hall on the condition that he attend rehab and\ntherapy. Tod had since become a devout Deitist, remarried, and\nbegun wearing his own jade again and teaching younger Green\nBones. A close friend of the Dauks, he managed the newest\ngrudge hall in the southern Port Massy suburb of Orslow,\nwhich was fast becoming a major city in its own right and\nboasted a growing population of newer, wealthier Kekonese\nimmigrants.\nThe rest of the seats at the table were occupied by men that\nAnden didn’t know well, although Sana had told him about\nsome of them: Migu Sun, an old friend of Rohn Toro who\nspoke for the Kekonese Green Bones in Adamont Capita;\nHasho Baku, a representative from Evenfield, five hours away;\nand of course, Remi Jon.

In total there were close to twenty\npeople in the dining room, all of them having traveled here for\nDauk Losun’s funeral and to find out how Green Bone affairs\nwould be managed in the aftermath of his death.\nAnden, too, was curious and apprehensive. Sana had\nalways been her husband’s partner and advisor, in truth his\nWeather Man, but she was an elderly woman now. Anden\ncouldn’t imagine the young men around the table accepting\nher authority. Cory was Dauk’s son, but he was not like his\nfather. Espenian-born and easygoing, his greatest use to the\ncommunity was as a lawyer and someone who was outwardly\nlegitimate and part of mainstream society in nearly all ways.\nThe other men around the table who wore jade were\nacknowledged leaders in their own districts, but none of them\nhad the national standing of Dauk Losun. This was not their\nfailing; the Kekonese Green Bone population in Espenia was\nnot the small, concentrated community in Southtrap that it had\nbeen when Dauk arrived in the country sixty years ago.\nEveryone in the room was also well aware that the No\nPeak clan was sure to have a say. Kaul Hilo was not wearing\nthe dark suit and tie and somber expression from yesterday. He\nsat slouched in his chair, one arm leaning on the table, taking\nup space in his usual casual way. Jade gleamed across the gap\nof his open collar—more jade than anyone else in the room,\nperhaps more than the entire rest of the room put together. He\nwas not running the meeting, nor seated in any special place\nalong the table, but he was also not hiding that he was the\nwealthiest and most powerful man in attendance. Anden sat on\nthe Pillar’s right-hand side.\nSana began by thanking everyone for their condolences\nover the past week. “I know my husband is in the afterlife\nlooking down gladly at all the friends he has.” Cory put a hand\non his mother’s arm in comfort and her wavering voice\nsteadied. “I’m grateful to those of you who’ve traveled here\nfrom Evenfield and Adamont Capita and Resville, and\nespecially from Kekon.” She turned toward Hilo and Anden.\n“Our whole community is honored that the Pillar of the No\nPeak clan himself would come from so far away to grieve with\nus, along with our dear friend Anden.”\nHilo said, “I would never fail to pay my final respects to a\nfriend and fellow Pillar.”\nSana dabbed her eyes and nodded in mute gratitude before\ngathering herself and continuing. “Our Kekonese community\nand our Green Bone traditions were the most important things\nto Losun. All his life, he did his best to protect them. Now that\nhe’s gone, we have some decisions to make about the future.”\nSana looked to her son, who sat forward as all eyes shifted\nto him. “No one can fill my father’s shoes as Pillar,” Cory said\nmatter-of-factly, without any shame or criticism. “But my\nmother and I, along with Sammy and Tod, have been talking to\nas many Green Bones as we can in the Port Massy area.

We\nwant to bring all of you into the decision about what direction\nour community should take in the future.”\nSana said, “Losun and I often talked about our hopes that\nwe Kekonese could achieve the same things as anyone else\nwho was born in this country, that our children and\ngrandchildren could become business leaders or movie stars or\nassemblymen. Yet how will that happen so long as we’re\nassociated with jade, which is still misunderstood and has a\nbad reputation in Espenia?” The widow sighed deeply.\n“Should we give up our culture, our birthright for thousands of\nyears, and become just like the weaker immigrants such as the\nTuni or Shotarians? Or do we instead give up the chance to be\naccepted and have lawful influence? There’s no good choice.\nWe have to find another way. That’s what our friends in No\nPeak have been trying to do.”\nShe looked to Hilo. This was not Kekon, and these Green\nBones had sworn no clan oaths, so when Hilo drew his gaze\naround the table and spoke, it was not with the quick, easy\nauthority Anden was accustomed to, but mildly and\npersuasively. “Many of you know that No Peak has been\ntrying to change the laws against jade in this country. My\ncousin Anden won us the first victory when he convinced\nEspenian doctors and politicians to legalize jade for medical\nuse. Today, there are Kekonese doctors running clinics right\nhere in Port Massy. Andy, tell us how many there are now.”\nAnden said, “There are sixty licensed jade medicine clinics\nand around two hundred recognized practitioners in Espenia. I\nwas part of the panel of doctors from the College of\nBioenergetic Medicine in Janloon that drafted the international\nstandards of practice that these clinics are required to meet to\nbe certified. The National Assembly has approved a special\nvisa to allow Kekonese doctors to move to Espenia to practice\nmedicine, and last year there were twelve Keko-Espenians\nadmitted into the college in Janloon, the largest number of\ninternational students they’ve ever had.”\nHilo said, “What Andy’s done was a big step, but we’re\nnot there yet, not where we want to be. The clan has been\nworking with a PR firm to change Espenian attitudes about\njade. Maybe you’ve seen some of the ads. It seems the surest\nway to make anything happen in this country is to get on\ntelevision.” This garnered chuckles from around the table.\nRigly Hollin and his partners at WBH Focus, armed with\nresearch from focus groups and attitudinal studies, had taken\nout full-page magazine ads, billboards, and television spots\nthat presented jade in a positive light. Anden had seen one in\nthe Air Espenia in-flight magazine on their way over to Port\nMassy: a photograph of a group of Navy Angels holding up\ntheir jade dog tags with the exhortation to SUPPORT OUR JADE\nWARRIORS. It had made Hilo grimace with contempt, but no\none could argue with Shae’s strategy. The Espenians would\nnever accept jade unless they believed they owned it as much"

        "text": "WARRIORS. It had made Hilo grimace with contempt, but no\none could argue with Shae’s strategy. The Espenians would\nnever accept jade unless they believed they owned it as much\nas anyone in the world, even the Kekonese.\nSana said, “If jade was accepted by society, we could live\nopenly as Green Bones without fear of the law. In our\ncommunities, there could be not only jade medicine clinics,\nbut proper Deitist temples, and schools teaching the jade\ndisciplines. Of course, it would never be the same as Kekon,\nbut it would be much better than it is now.” Sana’s voice was\nstill strong, but she was not used to being the center of\nattention. She looked around the table of Green Bone men\nbefore clutching her hands together and firming her lips.\n“Most importantly, we would no longer have to choose\nbetween being Kekonese or Espenians. We could be both. That\nis a dream I know Losun would want to see come true.”\nCory nodded and straightened in his seat. “That’s why we\npropose forming a national organization: the Kekonese\nAssociation of Espenia—to promote cultural understanding\nand to address issues that affect the entire Keko-Espenian\ncommunity. We’ll help new immigrants, promote Kekonese\nculture and transamaric business ties, and lobby the\ngovernment to repeal the prohibition against jade.” He turned\ntoward Hilo and Anden. “It won’t be a clan. There won’t be a\nPillar. But it’ll be Green Bones working together to protect our\ncommunity, so in that most important way, it’ll be similar.”\nDauk Losun must’ve been proud of his son in the end,\nAnden thought. Cory wasn’t green in the soul in the traditional\nKekonese sense, but he’d found his own way to be successful\nin his father’s world. When he spoke, it was with a compelling\nconfidence.\nThe lawyer grew more serious as he addressed the entire\nroom again. “If we hope to accomplish our goals, however, we\nneed to work together to shift certain cultural attitudes and\nchange the way Kekonese-Espenians are viewed by the public.\nIf we want the ban on jade repealed, then we need to\ndemonstrate that Green Bones are law-abiding citizens in all\nother respects. Which means taking steps to pull out of illegal\nactivities.” An expectant silence fell over the dining table.\n“Take our grudge halls, for example. Before my da passed\naway we discussed implementing new rules: no more\ncockfighting or illegal gambling, and no more clean-bladed\ndueling. Nothing that will give the police an excuse to raid our\nproperties.”\nA murmur of incredulity rose from the out-of-town Green\nBones. “What’s the point of even having the grudge halls\nwithout those things?” exclaimed Hasho Baku, the Green\nBone leader from Evenfield. “People are going to duel no\nmatter what you say. They’ll just do it somewhere else and be\neven more likely to be caught.”\n“Fatal duels are the main problem,” Cory said. “The law\ndoesn’t recognize clean blades, so if there are deaths or serious\ninjuries, we expose ourselves to police scrutiny and criminal"

We can find a way to allow people to settle issues of\nhonor in a manner that’s more legally acceptable. The grudge\nhalls can continue to be centers of social life without\nviolence.”\nSammy spoke up. “On the whole, we’ve been successfully\nholding our own against the Crews. So successful, in fact, that\nthere are areas of the country where we’ve pushed them out,\nbut instead of making those neighborhoods safe for everyone,\nit’s Kekonese gangsters who’ve taken over the drug dealing,\nprostitution, extortion, and racketeering.” No one was looking\ndirectly at Jon Remi, but it was obvious who Sammy was\nreferring to. “Every time a Kekonese man gets arrested or\nimprisoned for a serious crime while wearing jade, it\nreinforces negative stereotypes. As Green Bones, we need to\nenforce stricter standards about who we train and allow to be\ngreen, and what activities we shouldn’t tolerate.”\nJon Remi snorted. The sound was loud enough to be heard\nfrom the other end of the table. “And who’s going to say what\nis or isn’t allowed? You?” He turned his gaze on Hilo and\nAnden and crossed his tattooed arms. “Or will the great No\nPeak clan decide for us?”\n“As a lawyer who’s worked on dozens of these cases,”\nCory responded, “I can tell you that a person charged with jade\npossession, who isn’t engaged in any other offense and has no\nprior criminal record, might be convicted of a minor offense\nthat carries a one- or two-year sentence. We’re almost always\nable to get prison time suspended in favor of a fine and\ncommunity service. On the other hand, if someone is wearing\njade when they’re arrested for selling drugs, running a\nprotection racket, or committing assault or murder, that’s an\naggravating factor and we’re looking at felony crimes and life\nsentences.”\nMigu Sun, the older Green Bone who had come from\nAdamont Capita, cleared his throat and began to speak in a\nquiet, thoughtful voice. “I grew up in a Deitist family and was\nalways taught that the gods left jade on earth as a test for us\nmortals. If they gave us back some of the power of Heaven,\nhow would we use it? Would we wield that power over others\nand use it for evil? Or would we work for the common good,\nand protect the weak? I grew up hearing of legendary jade\nwarrior heroes and cheering the resistance fighters of the One\nMountain Society. But when jade was brought to these shores\nfrom the old country, it was corrupted by Espenian culture.\nNow young people see it as simply a way to get what they\nwant. Many of them use shine and other drugs, and they don’t\ntrain in the jade disciplines like they used to. Dauk Losun was\na wise and influential man, and all his life he lived modestly\nand relied on the counsel of his wife and trusted friends. He\nonly wanted us all to live better lives in this country.”\nMigu turned to Sana and Cory and said, “If we have to"

He\nonly wanted us all to live better lives in this country.”\nMigu turned to Sana and Cory and said, “If we have to\nchange the grudge halls, so be it. Let the Crews have the\nillegal businesses. If we don’t stop our own people from\ngetting into drugs and crime, Green Bones will end up in\nprison, and our jade in the hands of the government, and in the\nend, we’ll be just like the barukan in Shotar, with no real\nprospects.” Migu stood up, turned to Hilo and saluted him\ndeeply. “Kaul-jen, your clan has already accomplished a great\ndeal here. If you say you’ll support us, surely anything is\npossible. May the gods shine favor on No Peak. For the sake\nof all Kekonese.”\nRemi barked a laugh as harsh as a gunshot. “You old fool.\nYou think the No Peak clan is running ads and lobbying\npoliticians for our sake?” He shook his head, smirking at Migu\nSun. “The clans in Kekon don’t give a shit about any of us.\nThe Kauls only want to grow their business empire, and they\nwant us—the kespies that they don’t even think of as real\nGreen Bones—to fall into line and behave ourselves so there’s\nnothing to dirty the shiny image they show the Espenian\ngovernment and the companies they work with. They expect\nus to take orders from them like their Fingers. Next, they’ll\nsuggest we give up our jade altogether.”\n“No one can ask that of anyone.” Hilo’s words cut the air\nas sharply as Remi’s laugh. The attention in the room snapped\ntoward him. “No Peak has many business interests in Espenia,\nit’s true, and we want to grow and protect them. That’s no\nsurprise to anyone. We bring money and jobs and jade, so you\nbenefit as much as we do.” Hilo’s steady gaze settled on Remi\nand the reminder hung between them. “Many years ago, I told\nDauk Losun that if we worked together, we Kekonese would\nbecome more powerful in this country than the Crews. Now\nI’m telling all of you the same thing. The Dauks are right. The\nbiggest threat to you isn’t the Crews anymore. It’s your lower\nstatus here that’s a hardship. If you want to stop hiding your\njade, then you have to stop doing things with it that need to be\nhidden.”\n“You expect me to swallow that hypocritical bullshit?”\nRemi pointed at Hilo. “The clans in Janloon collect tribute.\nWhy shouldn’t I do the same in Resville?”\n“Tribute!” Sana exclaimed with indignation. “Do you think\nyou’re a Fist? Have you sworn oaths to a clan? Will you help a\ntributary business owner by accepting his son into a martial\nschool, or extending him a loan to expand his store, or paying\nhim if a typhoon hits his house? No, you think the way the\nCrews think—only taking and never giving. That’s not how\nwe’ll ever succeed in this country.”\nRemi sat back in his chair and spread his arms arrogantly,\nindicating his expensive clothes and the trio of tough-looking"

They clapped their boss on the\nshoulder and one of them stuck his tongue out at the room like\na hyena, showing off his jade studs. Anden was astonished.\nEven in Espenia, he’d never seen Green Bones act so\nimproperly in front of senior warriors, much less the Pillar.\nSammy and Tod tensed as a warning murmur began to rise\nfrom the other men along the walls. Hilo remained motionless.\nCory stood up and spread his hands in a placating gesture\nto the room. “Take it easy, everyone. Nothing is going to\nchange overnight. We all know the situation in Resville is\ndifferent from Port Massy.” He spoke amenably, a peacemaker\nseeking a middle ground. Anden stifled a grimace at the\nweakness of it, the un-Green-Bonelike retreat. “Look, Jon, if\nyou have no interest in being involved in the association, that’s\nfine,” Cory said. “But we’re asking you, for your own good as\nwell as ours, to think ahead. Start taking steps to pull out of the\nriskiest businesses and activities. If you need any legal counsel\nabout how to go legitimate—”\nRemi rose from his seat, hands on the table. “I don’t need\nyour help, crumb. I don’t answer to any community\nassociation, and I sure as fuck don’t take orders from No\nPeak.” He turned his head to the Pillar. There were not many\nmen who could match Kaul Hilo’s stare, but Jon Remi was one\nof them. “How many people have you killed or ordered to be\nkilled, but you’re telling me I’ve got to behave? Your clan’s\ngot office towers and vaults of money and a whole fucking\nisland full of jade, but you’ve got the gall to tell me and my\nboys not to eat. You sponsor people to come here from\nJanloon, clan stooges who take up college spots and jobs and\nwho send the money they make back to Kekon, but you want\nthose of us who’ve clawed tooth and nail for our fair share in\nthis country to walk away from our hard-won livelihoods and\nlet the Crews come back in and snap it all up.” Remi’s nostrils\nflared, and his crudely handsome features darkened with\ndangerous resentment. “You agreed that I could have Resville.\nSo long as I kept your enemies out, you’d leave me to run\nthings my way. Well I’ve done what you asked, and now\nyou’re stepping on me? You old country kecks think you’re\nbetter than the rest of us? No. You owe me, Kaul.”\nAnden was sitting close enough to Hilo to feel his cousin’s\njade aura ripple and sharpen like the end of a whip. The Pillar\nsaid, in a soft voice, “I owe you nothing. You’re not a tributary\nclan, you’re not a Lantern Man, you’re not even a friend,\nbecause a friend wouldn’t speak in such a way, even in"

It made you a rich and\npowerful man. It’s only out of respect for our past alliance that\nI’m not going to take offense at the things you’ve said. I came\nto pay my respects to Dauk Losun—let the gods recognize him\n—and to support his family and successors. I brought none of\nmy Fists or Fingers with me. Look around the room. It’s your\nfellow Green Bones that are asking you to change in a way\nthat may be hard at first, but that everyone agrees will be\nbetter in the long run.”\nRemi stood to his full height. The tattoo of the black skull\nwith the snakes coming out of its eye sockets seemed to stretch\nits deathly grin as he swung his pale sport jacket off the back\nof his chair and over his shoulder. “I don’t give a shit about the\ntiny chance of jade being legalized, or No Peak’s investments.\nI respected Dauk while he was alive, but we’ve got our own\nterritories now and our own ways of handling things. I don’t\nhave a problem with anyone in this room so long as we mind\nour own businesses and leave each other to eat well. Do\nwhatever you want in Port Massy, but I’ll run Resville my own\nway.”\nThe Bad Keck jerked his head to his men, and the\nSnakeheads walked out of the meeting. No one spoke or tried\nto stop them as they shouldered past the other Green Bones in\nthe room, smirking beneath their sunglasses as they exited the\nhouse. An uncomfortable silence hung in their wake.\nReluctantly, Hasho Baku stood as well. “Jon spoke too\nbluntly and rudely,” he said, “but I agree with him. I think the\nchances of repealing the laws against jade are too small to be\nworth the effort of creating this association, and the changes\nyou propose will only create division between Green Bones.”\nHe saluted Dauk Sana and Kaul Hilo. “I respect your\nintentions and I won’t stand in your way, but I think it would\nbe best if we all return to our own cities and not try to dictate\nwhat other Green Bones do. That way, we can all remain\nfriends.” He nodded to everyone else around the table, then\ndeparted the house with his own men.\nCory expelled a loud breath. He scrubbed a hand through\nhis hair and slumped back in his chair with a rueful frown.\n“Well, that could’ve gone better.”\n“We knew there would be holdouts,” Tod said. “The rest of\nus are with you, Cory.”\nMigu Sun said, “I’ll speak privately to Hasho later. I\nbelieve he’ll come around if he starts to see that what we’re\nhoping for can be accomplished. At least we know he won’t\noppose us or cause trouble, and his people in Evenfield can be\ncounted on to be discreet with their jade.

Maybe they can bring him back to the table.”\nAnden had remained silent during the vociferous\nexchange, as Hilo would’ve expected him to, but he felt a little\nhot and sick, as he had after walking out of the Blue Olive\nnightclub. “Jon Remi can’t be persuaded to give up any of his\npower.”\n“Andy’s right,” Hilo said. “It’s too bad that Remi was born\non this side of the ocean. A man like that, who stands up for\nhimself and can command others—maybe if he’d been raised\nand trained as a proper Green Bone, he could’ve been a good\nFist. But fate makes us who we are and can’t be changed.”\nAt the tone of finality in Hilo’s voice, Dauk Sana sucked in\na breath. She left her seat and lowered herself next to Hilo’s\nchair. “Kaul-jen,” she said anxiously, “there’s no excuse for\nRemi’s rudeness to you as a visitor, much less a Pillar! No one\ncould blame you if you took offense and felt the need to\nrespond. But for the sake of peace, and on account of the\nfriendship you’ve shown to our family, please let those of us\nhere in Espenia handle it, as it’s our problem.” She pressed\nHilo’s hand. “And if we can’t, then we’ll disavow all of those\nGreen Bones in Resville, and work with the police to stop\nthem.”\nMigu Sun nodded solemnly, but the younger Green Bones\nin the room looked a little stunned. It hadn’t occurred to them\nas quickly as it had to Dauk Sana that Hilo might respond to\nRemi’s insults with swift retaliation. The widow was begging\nthe Pillar to stay his hand. If No Peak sent its Fists into\nResville to kill Remi and go to war with his gang, it would\nsurely attract more negative attention from the police and the\npublic. For a powerful Janloon clan to murder Espenian\ncitizens, even criminals like the Snakeheads, would undermine\nthe influence of the Kekonese Association of Espenia in its\ncrucial formative stages. Remi might even be expecting an\nattack now, Anden thought. He might be eager for a chance to\ngo up against old country Green Bones and grow his own\nreputation.\nHilo was silent for a moment. Then he took Dauk Sana’s\nhands and stood, smiling as he pulled her up with him. “No\nPeak has people and businesses in Espenia, but this isn’t our\ncountry. As a guest, I wouldn’t want to do anything that\ncreates trouble for my friends or goes against the goals we\nshare.” Hilo spoke to everyone in the room. “No Peak will stay\nout of Resville, as we have so far. You have my word as\nPillar.”\nSana’s shoulders came down in relief. “Thank you, Kaul-\njen.” She touched her clasped hands to her forehead. “I only\nwish Losun-se were here to thank you as well.”\nThe meeting ended on that somber note.

Hilo and Anden offered their final condolences to\nSana and Cory, accepted respectful salutes and well wishes for\nsafe travel, and took their leave.\nIn the taxi on the way back to the Crestwood Hotel, Hilo\nsat back and tapped out a cigarette, the last one in the box. He\nrolled it between his fingers but didn’t light it. “You were quiet\nback there, Andy. And you’re being quiet now.”\nAnden said, “You told me yesterday not to make my\nopinions so obvious.”\n“You’re bothered by Remi,” Hilo inferred. “Was what\nhappened today a surprise?”\n“No, but just because it’s an unsurprising problem doesn’t\nmean it’s not still a problem.”\nHilo grinned and reached across the seat to shove his\ncousin’s shoulder affectionately. “You would’ve been a great\nFist, Andy. I know that’s all in the past, so don’t take it the\nwrong way, I’m only saying it as a compliment.” He turned\nserious again. “Remi Jonjunin is like a Crew Boss with a\nKekonese face. I thought there was a chance he would\ncompromise to stay on good terms with the people in that\nroom, but it’s obvious he doesn’t believe he needs us or\nanyone in Port Massy anymore. Why are you taking his insults\nso personally?”\n“We made Remi,” Anden exclaimed. “We gave him the\nmoney and jade that he used to become the Bad Keck of\nResville. I was the one who spoke for the clan and gave him\nfree rein in that city. So it’s my fault that he’s now a problem\nfor us.”\nHilo put the unlit cigarette into his mouth. “I trusted you to\nmake the right decision at the time and you did. What was\ngood for us then is bad for us now, but that’s the way things\nhappen sometimes. Your Port Massy friends are asking us to\ntrust them to deal with the Bad Keck. That’s just as well. We\nhave to keep our attention at home, fighting the clanless.”\nAnden gave the Pillar a skeptical look. “Hilo-jen,” he said.\n“Cory, Tod, Sammy—I like all of them. They’re good people\nwho care about their community and what it means to wear\njade. I want their association to succeed. But they’re not a\nclan. They’re green in their own way, but not in the way that’s\nneeded to go up against someone with no morals like Jon\nRemi.”\nThe taxi pulled up to the front of the Crestwood Hotel and\nthey got out. Hilo drew his coat around his neck and paused\noutside the hotel’s revolving doors. “Give it some time, Andy.\nYesterday, I told you Remi was our ally until I said otherwise.”\nHe fingered his lighter, then reluctantly placed the lone\ncigarette back into its box. “Now I’m saying otherwise.”\nCHAPTER\n31\nDisappointment\nK\naul Nikoyan lay on his back in the girl’s apartment,\nwatching the light from the silenced television screen flicker\noff the ceiling.

The girl, Mera, was still gamely mouthing his\ncock, but they’d had sex already and his mind was elsewhere.\nThe sun had gone down. He glanced at the clock on the\nbedside table. In an hour, he would be expected to report to\nLott Jin, who would assign him to his duties for the night\nahead.\nNiko knew his uncle would disapprove of how he’d spent\nthe afternoon. No getting laid before work, not on the greener\nside of the clan, Hilo would say, echoing commonly held jade\nwarrior wisdom. Good Fists and Fingers did not go out into\nthe street relaxed and unalert. They set out as sharp as wolves\nthat had not yet eaten.\nNiko didn’t believe in old adages, and his uncle already\nfound fault with him on a number of fronts, so why should one\nadditional failing matter? Besides, although there might be an\nopportunity to exercise force tonight, perhaps even confiscate\nsome illegally worn jade, he didn’t expect to face anything too\ndangerous. There’d never been any question that Niko would\nbecome a Finger in the clan, but the Pillar had instructed Juen\nNu not to coddle him. He was to be given the same amount of\nwork, risk, and expectation of discipline as any new Green\nBone. Juen Nu, however, would be retiring this year. The\nPillar had already given his permission. Lott Jin was the\nleading candidate to become the next Horn, but until the\npromotion was official, Niko doubted the First Fist would risk\nhis standing with the Kaul family by allowing the heir of the\nclan to come to any real harm under his supervision.\n“Do you want to order in anything to eat?” Niko asked, as\na way to get the girl to give up on trying to arouse him again.\nMera pushed her hair back and flopped down next to him, her\nlipstick smeared. She was pretty, but other pretty girls had\ntried to capture Niko’s attention before. He’d been sixteen\nyears old when a girl had first offered herself to him in a dark\ncorner of the garden on his family’s estate during a clan New\nYear’s party. He hadn’t felt comfortable taking the opportunity\nthat time, or the next, but his curiosity had finally gotten the\nbetter of him and he’d since been with a few girls, to varying\ndegrees of satisfaction.\n“We can order in if you want,” Mera said, “but I’d rather\ngo out, wouldn’t you?”\n“I’m not that hungry, and I can eat later. I just thought\nmaybe you’d want something.”\n“The only thing I have an appetite for is you,” Mera\nsighed, draping her arm across his chest and laying her head\non his shoulder.\nShe sounded so dreamy that Niko suppressed a wince. At\nage twenty, he was already cynical about relationships. Mera\nwas only the latest young hopeful vying to win the heart of the\nfirstborn son of the Kaul family and marry into the leadership\nof the No Peak clan.\nNiko blamed his parents.

Everyone knew the romantic\nhistory of the young Kaul Hiloshudon falling in love with a\nstone-eye girl and elevating the formerly disgraced Maik\nfamily to the top of the clan. A few years ago, a cable network\nhad tried to make a saccharine television movie out of the\nstory, before the Weather Man’s office had intervened and shut\nit down. Even the tragic fate of Niko’s uncles, Kehn and Tar,\nhad not significantly dimmed the tale, perhaps because Kaul\nMaik Wen played a far more visible role as the wife of the\nPillar than any of her predecessors.\n“I like spending time with you. You’re a sweet girl,” Niko\nsaid.\nMera stiffened at his patronizing kindness. “I’m not sweet.\nI’m the youngest of four and my parents couldn’t afford to\nsend a girl to the Academy, but that doesn’t mean I’m a\ndelicate flower. My brothers have dueled. My older sister’s a\nLantern Man. My family’s middle class, but we’re green.”\n“I never said anything against your family.” Niko turned\nover and lay on his stomach; the pressure of the bed against\nhis back was becoming uncomfortable against his itching,\nhealing skin. Mera sat up and turned off the television. She\ndrew her legs up and looked down at him with silent, intense\nfrustration, as if having discovered the jigsaw puzzle she was\nworking on was missing a piece. Girls were certain that\nunderneath Niko’s reserved demeanor there lurked a\nhotblooded, passionate young Horn in the making, and were at\na loss when they couldn’t find that person.\nMera touched the tips of her fingers to the welts on his\nback and shoulders. “What happened?”\n“I was whipped, what do you think?” he muttered into the\npillow.\n“Your father whipped you?” She sounded surprised, almost\npleased, that the eldest son of the Pillar could be whipped for\nmisbehaving, like any ordinary youth.\n“He’s my uncle, not my father,” Niko corrected her. “And\nhe whipped me for not behaving like a proper Green Bone.”\nMera trailed her fingers up the back of his neck. “You\nseem like a proper Green Bone to me,” she cooed, lightly\ntouching the necklace resting against his skin. It was an\nintimate, daring gesture; there were Green Bone men who\ndidn’t even let their wives touch their jade. Niko’s necklace\nhad belonged to his father—his real father, Kaul Lan, a man\nhe’d heard much about and never known. There were six jade\nbeads on the chain. The others had been removed and safely\nstored away. They would be added back, his parents said, once\nhe earned them.\nNiko propped his chin onto his folded arms. “What is a\nproper Green Bone, anyway? Everyone seems to know what it\nisn’t—yet, it’s something we don’t bother to explain. We take\nit for granted that we can recognize greenness when we see it.\nBut can we, really? People take one look at my face, my name,\nand my jade and they think they know me.” Niko chuckled"

People take one look at my face, my name,\nand my jade and they think they know me.” Niko chuckled\nabsently and without much humor, then fell silent for some\ntime. “You know what I think?” he mused out loud. “I think all\nthey’re seeing is a shell. A bright green empty shell.”\nNiko had been speaking mostly to himself and didn’t\nexpect the girl to respond, but after a couple of minutes, he\nnoticed she’d gone quiet. Mera hadn’t moved away from him\non the bed, but her ardor had evaporated. She seemed closed\noff now, withdrawn.\nNiko felt a crawl of irritation, then relief. He rolled away\nfrom her on the bed and got up. He began dressing—pulling\non his pants, buttoning his shirt, strapping his talon knife to his\nbelt and securing his pistol in a shoulder holster. Before he left\nthe room, he sat down on the edge of the bed and placed a\ngentle kiss on Mera’s cheek. She didn’t move away, but she\ndidn’t tilt her face toward him with the expectation of anything\nmore.\n“I meant what I said. I enjoyed spending time with you,”\nNiko said. “Sorry if I ended up being a disappointment.” He\nstood and left the room.\n_______\nThe incident that had caused Niko’s uncle to punish him so\nseverely had started out innocuously enough the previous\nweek, in the Pig & Pig pub, as a bet between Fingers over\nsome unimportant thing, perhaps relayball. The loser of the\nbet, a young man named Kitu, took offense at something Niko\nsaid and offered to settle the disagreement with a physical\ncontest. Niko, who’d been nursing a cold all week, declined\nmore rudely than he’d intended, by saying he thought the other\nboy wasn’t worth his time. Kitu offered a clean blade.\nAs far as duels went, this one was fairly typical, with no\nreal personal grudges involved. No one expected either of the\ncombatants would try to kill the other, although of course,\nbecause the winner would claim the loser’s jade, the stakes\nwere still serious. All the other people in the pub began\nclearing space between the tables for the contest to happen.\nNiko remained seated. “Kitu, you don’t want to duel me.\nYou’ll lose.”\nThis was not in fact a foregone conclusion. Kitu’s family\nwas not well off, but he was of respectable account as a\nfighter, and the jade he wore as a second-rank Finger had been\nwon, not inherited. Kaul Niko, in comparison, was naturally\ntalented and his family employed a bevy of personal coaches,\nbut within the clan, people quietly said he didn’t put in the\neffort to be at the level one would expect from a Kaul.\nEven if Kitu lost the duel, he would gain regard simply for\nhaving had the thick blood to challenge the first son of the\nKaul family, and if he made an especially good showing, he\nwould be taken more seriously and others might measure him\nto be worth a future contest. Kitu said, impatiently, “Are you\ngoing to get up or not?”"

Kitu said, impatiently, “Are you\ngoing to get up or not?”\nNiko said, “I fought a duel a month ago, keke.” That duel\nhad been closer than Niko would’ve liked to admit and had\nnearly broken his jaw. “I don’t feel like it tonight.”\nThe refusal surprised and disappointed everyone, Kitu\nmost of all. Young Green Bones intending to advance on the\nmilitary side of the clan looked for opportunities to duel, and it\nwas poor form to refuse a clean blade so long as it was\nsincerely offered and there wasn’t some extenuating\ncircumstance. “If you’re too drunk or lazy right now, I’ll meet\nyou tomorrow at noon,” Kitu said, and waited for the other\nman to name the place and weapon of choice.\n“Are you that eager to get your ass kicked and lose your\njade?” Niko spoke indifferently, but he was filled with a\nsudden, ferocious resentment. It wasn’t that he disdained\nKitu’s skill or was afraid to face him. He’d come to the Pig &\nPig to relax and didn’t see why he had to upend his evening\nsimply because someone wanted the chance to make a name\nfor himself. And he was galled by how quickly even his own\nfriends had jumped up to move chairs and tables, expecting\nhim to duel at the drop of a pin.\nNiko took out the car keys from his jacket pocket and held\nthem up. He was indeed slightly inebriated, but not so much\nthat he wasn’t able to think clearly or had a strong enough\nexcuse not to accept the challenge. “Kitu, you know what you\nneed more than a broken face? A new car. That piece of junk\nyou drive has got to be twenty years old. Isn’t it your ma’s old\ntwo-door Tezzo?” Niko jangled the keys. “I’ll tell you what,”\nhe said, “you can have a clean-bladed duel, or you can have\nmy car. It’s a Roewolfe SX Coupe, only two years old. My\nparents gave it to me when I graduated from the Academy. It’s\nsitting out in the parking lot right now.” He tossed the car keys\nonto the table. They skidded a little and came to rest between\nthe two young men.\nThe entire pub had gone silent. Kitu looked from Niko to\nthe keys and back again. “You’re joking.”\nNiko shrugged and gestured at the keys. “Take them,” he\nsaid. “We’ll agree I’ve paid for insulting you, and you’ll get a\npiece of Kaul property without any blood loss or broken\nbones.”\nOne of Niko’s friends said, uncomfortably, “Um, Niko-jen,\nare you sure you want to do this? I mean, it doesn’t seem right.\nWhy don’t you wait until tomorrow and see if you’re both\nready to fight the duel then.” Several others murmured\nagreement. No one was sure if what Niko was doing went\nagainst aisho per se, but it certainly was not in accordance\nwith dueling custom of any sort.\nNiko said, “What’s your decision, Kitu?”\nKitu’s face went through a series of contortions.

His brows\ndrew together, his nose wrinkled, his lips twitched and twisted.\nHe picked up the car keys and stood there tense for several\nseconds, expecting Niko to laugh at him for taking the joke\nseriously and then demand his car keys back. When this didn’t\nhappen, he seemed unable to put the keys back down on the\ntable.\nIt was true what Niko had said, that Kitu’s mother’s old car\nwas on its last legs and he didn’t have the money for a new\none. And it was also true that the outcome of any duel was\nuncertain; he might be injured, or lose his jade, or even be\nkilled. He’d been willing to take the risk, but now he was not\nso sure. He had a feeling that he was being toyed with, but he\nwas not sure what to do about it.\nKitu backed away slowly, his eyes still on Niko and his\njade aura taut with incredulity. He backed up all the way to the\ndoor of the pub and exited the building. A minute later,\neveryone in the unnaturally quiet room heard Niko’s Roewolfe\nstart up and drive away.\nA fit of laughter broke out then—less in mirth or\namusement than disbelief and discomfort. Everyone felt as if\nNiko had somehow beaten and humiliated Kitu even though\nhe’d given him an expensive car. But it had reflected badly on\nNiko as well, had shown him to be cruel in a very strange way.\nIt was as if a man had stopped beside a homeless person and\noffered him a thousand dien to bark like a dog, and the poor\nbastard had done it.\nBy the time Niko got home that night, his uncle had heard\nof what happened. Word must’ve reached one of the clan’s\nFists, who had told the Horn, who had called the Pillar.\n“What on earth is wrong with you?” Hilo demanded. “That\nboy challenged you fairly. It was bad enough that you refused\nto duel, but you made him and yourself look like idiots.”\nPerhaps he expected Niko to say something, to defend himself,\nto act contrite or defiant, but Niko only stood there silently.\nHilo lost his temper entirely. “You’re a Kaul. You’re the\nPillar’s son! Your father and your grandfather are curled up\nwith shame in their godsdamned graves right now. Your\nmother and I didn’t raise you to act so disgracefully.”\n“I didn’t feel like fighting tonight,” Niko grumbled. “I\nhave a cold.”\n“If you felt too sick to defend your own jade, maybe you\nshouldn’t have gone out in the first place,” Hilo shouted. They\nwere shut in the Pillar’s study, but everyone in the house, and\npossibly the entire estate, could hear him. “No one is going to\nblame you for putting off a duel for a few days if you’re\ngetting over some bug. Instead, everyone is talking about how\nyou gave away your car to avoid a challenge. How can you\neven call yourself a Green Bone?”\nNiko watched his uncle struggle to come up with what sort\nof punishment would be adequate for such a failure of good"

How can you\neven call yourself a Green Bone?”\nNiko watched his uncle struggle to come up with what sort\nof punishment would be adequate for such a failure of good\nsense. In the end, he made Niko strip off his shirt and kneel to\nreceive a dozen lashes with a wooden rod. From now on, Niko\nwould be required to do two extra training sessions each week\nwith private coaches and Hilo would be attending the lessons\nonce a month to gauge his nephew’s martial development for\nhimself. Also, Niko was cut off from family funds until he\nearned some more jade for himself in a respectable way, and\nof course he would not be getting a new car.\nNiko left the room wincing from the welts on his back and\nstewing under a bitterly dark cloud. Ru had been waiting\noutside of the room to ask his father something, but after\nlistening to his brother being censured so grievously, he\ndecided against entering the study and went to the fridge to get\nNiko some ice for his injuries. Jaya, who was home from the\nAcademy over the spring blossom long weekend, looked up\nbriefly from the video game she was playing to say, “So you\nreally fucked up, huh?”\nIn Niko’s opinion, what was fucked up was that no one\nthought what he’d done was preferable, or even acceptable.\nKitu did need a new car. Niko had willingly given his away as\ncompensation for not providing the other man with the duel he\nwanted at that moment. What exactly, Niko fumed, was the\nproblem? What use was all of his family’s power and wealth,\nif it didn’t give him the freedom to do as he wished with his\nown time and property? Of all the people in the world who\nwore jade, only Green Bones were expected to abide by strict\nrules that didn’t even make sense.\nKitu’s father brought the Roewolfe SX Coupe back to the\nKaul estate the next day, with his shamefaced son in tow. The\nPillar assured them that their profuse apologies were\nunnecessary. Niko, he explained, had been drunk and taken a\njoke too far. He certainly hadn’t meant to embarrass Kitu or\nhis family. “Young men do stupid things sometimes,” Hilo had\nsighed in commiseration with Kitu’s father.\n_______\nAfter leaving Mera’s apartment, Niko reported to Lott Jin at\nthe Plum Bun, a bakery in the Forge owned by a Lantern Man\nof the clan. Between the time it closed to customers in the\nafternoon and when the bakers came to work in the early hours\nof the following morning, the bakery was a meeting location,\none of dozens throughout the city where Fists could convene\nwith their Fingers. Niko wished he’d eaten something at\nMera’s after all; the pervasive scent of bread and sweet cakes\nmade his mouth water. Two of Lott’s other Green Bones were\nalready there when Niko arrived. Kenjo was dark and compact\nand an expert when it came to guns and cars. Like Niko, he\nwas a first-rank Finger and would soon be up for promotion to\nFist.

Sim was two and a half months out of the Academy, with\nthree stones of graduation jade and the twitchy, puffed-up\nenergy of a gamecock at its first fight.\nNiko expected the three of them would be assigned to\npatrol the Forge, where there’d been a recent spate of violence\nbetween Uwiwan and barukan youth street gangs. To his\nsurprise, Lott Jin said, “I hope you’re all hungry to wet your\nblades tonight. We’re acting on a tip about a couple of arms\nsmugglers who sold a hundred militarygrade Ankev rifles to\nthe Clanless Future Movement before the Janloon bombing.\nThe information came from one of our White Rats, but it leads\ninto the Stump, and there are outstanding arrest warrants. So,\nit’s a three-ring.”\nThey all groaned. A “three-ring” had become the\ncolloquial term on the military side of the clan for a situation\nrequiring the involvement of both the No Peak and Mountain\nclans as well as the Janloon police. In the relentless campaign\nto root out and destroy anti-clan elements, three-ring\noperations had become common. Green Bones hated them.\nThe clans traditionally exercised control over their own\ndistricts and kept out of each other’s territory. It was a time-\nhonored tactic for criminals to escape across territorial borders\nto evade Green Bones, and an equally long-standing tradition\nfor Fists and Fingers to exchange information and favors with\ncounterparts in rival clans, even during war, even when their\nleaders were mortal enemies. An arsonist who set fire to a\nMountain property would be caught by No Peak and handed\nover in exchange for a shine dealer who plied his trade in\nCoinwash but had escaped to Fishtown. The Janloon police\nhandled everything that fell below clan notice—petty crime,\nthe average murder or armed robbery, traffic infractions—and\nwere grudgingly accustomed to working under the influence of\nboth major clans as well as cleaning up after them. Everyone\nliked it that way, even the criminals.\nAfter the Janloon bombing, however, the eradication of\nanti-clan extremism became the top national priority. The\nClanless Future Movement’s armed uprising had been\ndramatic and frightening, but swiftly crushed. The Royal\nCouncil promptly banned the terrorist group and urged the\nclans and the police to coordinate their efforts to a far greater\nextent than before. Niko’s family would never see Ayt Mada\nas anything but the bitterest enemy, and on a national and\ninternational level, the contest for jade, business, and political\npower continued unabated between the Mountain and No\nPeak. But the streets of Janloon were the domain of the Horn.\nJuen Nu and Aben Soro were pragmatic men, loyal to their\nclans but not members of the Kaul and Ayt families. Decades\nof clan rivalry, while not set aside, were relegated below the\nneed for day-to-day cooperation against the threat of clanless\nagitators.\nThe efforts were paying off. In recent years, thousands of\nCFM members and supporters had been arrested or killed. No\none liked three-rings, but it seemed they were here to stay.

Lott\nJin passed around several black-and-white photographs of the\ntwo arms dealers walking down the street, entering or exiting\nbuildings, talking to people. “Take a good look. Tonight\nthey’re making a sale out of a hideout on Banya Street. We’re\ngoing in with three of the Mountain’s people.”\nNiko was the last to study the photographs. One of the\narms dealers was Kekonese, the other was an Uwiwan. Banya\nStreet was in the middle of a crowded Uwiwan immigrant\nneighborhood in the Stump. As if reading Niko’s thoughts, or\nmerely Perceiving his unease, Lott cautioned them all, “It’s on\nunfamiliar turf for us, and there’ll be a lot of people around. If\nwe fuck up, it means problems between Juen-jen and Aben-\njen. That means problems for me, which means problems for\nyou. If there’s a mess, let the Mountain handle it; it’s their\nterritory.”\nLott flicked open a lighter and burned the photographs.\nThey would need to identify the targets from memory and\nensure they were captured or killed. Simply handing the\nphotos to the Mountain and trusting them to do the deed was\nout of the question. Information gleaned from the images—\nwhen and where they were taken, at what angle, from what\ndistance—might compromise the identity of a valuable White\nRat, one the Mountain would happily find and kill if they\ncould, since the spy was no doubt also providing information\nto No Peak about the Mountain’s activities.\nThey drove in Lott’s savagely beautiful red Lumezza FT\nScorpion and parked near the fish head—the oddly shaped\nintersection of Way Street and Magnolia Avenue that sat on\nthe clan border between the poor neighborhoods of Coinwash\nand Fishtown. The men got out of the car and waited. The city\nhad been damp with Northern Sweat all week, but earlier in\nthe evening the clouds had dissolved and it didn’t look as if it\nwould rain further. Niko scratched at his itching back.\nSim came up to him. “Niko-jen, I was wondering …” He\nrubbed the side of his acne-scarred face nervously. “My little\nniece, the one who’s been in the hospital … Her birthday is\ncoming up. She’s a huge Janloon Spirits relayball fan, and I\nknow that the clan has stadium boxes. I was told that you have\nto be second-rank Fist or above to get on the waitlist, but do\nyou think there’s any chance, if it’s no trouble …”\nNiko shrugged. “I can ask my uncle. Maybe there’s room\nto squeeze a couple more people into the box at the next\ngame.”\nSim’s face split in a huge grin. “It would mean Heaven and\nearth to her. I’d be eternally grateful if the Pillar made an\nexception. Of course, I understand if it’s not possible.” He\ntouched his forehead. “Thank you, Niko-jen.”\nIt occurred to Niko minutes later that he should’ve asked\nSim his niece’s name, how old she was, how long she’d been a\nrelayball fan.

It was\nKaul Hilo’s great talent. He could have a single ordinary\nconversation with a man and make him loyal for life. Niko’s\nmother would not only ask the name of Sim’s niece, she would\nremember her birthday and send her a Janloon Spirits jersey\nthe following year. Both Ru and Jaya would’ve easily come up\nwith something more to say.\nSuch behavior did not come naturally to Niko. The tending\nof relationships and influence, the leading of men. Much of the\ntime, he preferred to be alone, and he especially disliked being\nforced into the social spotlight. He didn’t extend or accept\ntrust easily. He had close friends such as the Juen twins and his\ncousin Maik Cam, and he didn’t think of himself as unfriendly,\nbut many of the classmates and fellow Fingers who’d tried to\nget close to him over the years had found the task difficult.\nMera was only the latest example.\nA few days after Niko had been punished for failing to\nduel Kitu, the Pillar had taken him out for breakfast, just the\ntwo of them. Hilo had cooled down by then and wanted to\ntalk. “Niko-se,” he sighed, “I’m hard on you only because I\nlove you. When the time comes for you to lead the clan, I want\nyou to be well prepared, much more than I was. Everything\nyou do now, even as a Finger, is a bit of a picture you’re filling\nin about yourself and the family.”\nNiko hadn’t pointed out to his uncle that it seemed the\npicture was already very much filled in, and his job was to fit\nhimself into it. Sometimes, to his shame, he even envied Ru\nfor being a stone-eye and Jaya for being a girl—at least they\nhad other options. He didn’t dare to admit these feelings to his\nuncle.\nLott Jin checked his watch and scowled. Anyone who\nworked under Juen Nu was accustomed to timeliness. Niko\nstudied the First Fist, trying selfishly to figure out what made\nhim exceptional, what had enabled him to climb above\nhundreds of other warriors in the clan. Jade ability was only\npart of the equation. Lott was certainly a strong Green Bone,\nand his skill with throwing knives was legendary, but there\nwere others of equal or greater martial prowess. Nor was Lott\nthe most well-liked of the senior Fists. At times, he could be\npessimistic and confrontational, scornful in his criticisms and\nspare with praise. Yet, something about him had attracted the\nPillar’s attention years ago. Niko tried to find the right word.\nResolved. Lott Jin seemed to have shaped himself around\nbeing a Green Bone of the clan. Some people simply lived by\nfollowing their natural inclinations. Others decided what they\nwished to be and then made themselves that way.\nThree metallic green Torroyo RP800 motorcycles drove\nthrough the fish head intersection and pulled up around the\nLumezza.

An unpleasant jolt of recognition stiffened\nNiko’s spine as he straightened away from the car. It had been\nseveral years since he’d laid eyes on Ayt Atosho in person,\nalthough he’d seen him on television a few times. In recent\nyears, the man’s good looks had settled, like a clay sculpture\nafter firing. Lines of small jade studs pierced over both\neyebrows drew attention to his heavy-lidded eyes. He wore a\ntraditional fitted leather vest over a bold red shirt with jade\ncuff links. Ayt Ato was a picture of urban Green Bone style.\nNiko had heard it said jokingly that every woman in the\nMountain clan was in love with Ayt Ato. Sadly for them, Ayt\nMada had purportedly forbidden her twenty-seven-year-old\nnephew from dating until he completed his university degree,\nwhich he’d been working toward on a part-time basis for the\npast six years.\n“Lott-jen,” Ayt Ato called out as he strolled toward them.\n“I’m told you’ll soon be the Horn of No Peak.”\n“That’s for the Pillar to decide,” the First Fist replied\ncurtly. Lott’s father had been murdered and beheaded by the\nMountain many years ago. Necessity compelled Lott to work\nwith Green Bones on the other side, but he was never friendly\ntoward anyone in the Mountain clan.\nAyt Ato’s gaze drifted past Lott and fell on Niko. “Kaul-\njen.” Ayt Ato’s aura was at odds with his physical confidence\n—tight and wary, like a cloak worn over the shoulders.\n“Ayt-jen,” Niko said.\nIt was the first time the two of them had stood before each\nother and exchanged so much as a word. An odd hesitation\nstretched across the moment. Niko became acutely aware of\nthe other jade auras around him, the pressure of them against\nhis Perception. He thought he ought to do or say something\nsubtle but powerful in that instant to show himself an equal to\nthis rival he’d never met or asked for. Perhaps doing so would\nbe easier if he could muster some personal hate for the man\ninstead of merely a vague resentment toward his existence.\nInstead, all Niko could think of was how obvious it was that he\nwas the younger, less heavily jaded Green Bone, not as well\ndressed, and merely a subordinate Finger, not a leader with his\nown warriors.\nAyt Ato broke the awkwardness by introducing the other\nMountain Green Bones who’d come up behind him. “This is\nKoben Ashi,” he said, indicating the taller one, son of the late\nKoben Yiro. “And Sando Kin.” Another of his cousins, by\nmarriage of his mother’s sister.\nLott made perfunctory introductions on the No Peak side,\nthen confirmed the details of the mission and officially asked\nfor permission to enter Mountain territory. Ayt Ato granted it.\nHe glanced at Niko. “Should we get going, then?”\nThe Mountain Green Bones got back onto their\nmotorcycles and escorted the Lumezza into the Stump.

Lott\nglanced over at Niko as he drove, perhaps sensing the agitation\nin his aura. “I didn’t know it would be Ayt Ato and the\nKobens,” said the First Fist.\n“It doesn’t matter,” Niko said, too quickly.\nLott frowned, though not without sympathy. “You’re right;\nit doesn’t. So don’t let it get to you. We’re all on the same side\ntonight.”\nNiko decided this was his uncle’s fault. Not the encounter\nwith Ayt Ato, but the fact that he was in this situation at all.\nThe Pillar had ordered Juen and Lott to give him more\nopportunities to earn green and prove himself. Niko fingered\nhis pistol and talon knife, then the jade beads around his\nthroat. He hated surprises that forced him to react quickly. He\nliked to think about things by himself, sometimes for a long\nwhile, before making decisions.\nThe address on Banya Street belonged to a pool hall,\nsandwiched between a barbershop and an adult video store.\nThe name Tialuhiya Nights blinked in red neon over darkened\nwindows. “Get ready,” Lott said.\nLott roared his sports car up to the front entrance while Ayt\nAto and his cousins swerved their bikes into the narrow alley\nbehind the rear doors. Immediately, two sentries posted on the\nsidewalk bolted into the pool hall like rabbits into a warren.\nThe instant the No Peak men were out of the car, a volley of\ngunfire erupted from the front of the building, shattering the\nstreet-facing windows and sending bystanders screaming and\nrunning for cover.\nNiko fell to a crouch and launched an instinctive rising\nDeflection. It overlapped with Kenjo’s wave and the\ninterference sent up a vertical blast of force that hurled bullets\nupward and tore clothes off the lines that stretched between\nbalconies in the narrow confines of the avenue. A stray shot\nshattered one of the Lumezza’s rear taillights.\n“Sons of dogfucking bitches.” Lott Jin unleashed a\nmassive Deflection that swept through the broken front\nwindows, sending glass flying back into the pool hall in a\nmaelstrom. Both of the visible shooters inside were knocked\nstaggering. The First Fist strode across the sidewalk, whipping\nthrowing knives one after the other, half a dozen of them, until\nthe sheath strapped to the small of his back was empty.\nNiko and the other Fingers rushed through the ruined front\nentry on Lott’s heels. One gunman was already dead, a knife\nprotruding from his throat and another from his left eye socket.\nThe other was lying on the ground, gurgling, hands clamped\naround the slim blade in his chest. Kenjo nudged his head over\nwith a toe to get a closer look at his face, then put a bullet\nbetween his eyes. Neither of the men were the arms dealers\nfrom the photos.\nA dozen people were huddled against the walls or under\nthe pool tables, including the bartender and two staff members.\nTheir thick, sour fear crowded Niko’s sense of Perception and\nheightened his racing adrenaline, but no spikes of murderous"

Sim shouted, “Everyone\nstay where you are! Don’t get in the way and you won’t be\nhurt.”\nKenjo tilted his head. “In the back.”\n“Niko, take the lead,” Lott ordered.\nNiko swallowed as he drew his talon knife and moved\nquickly but cautiously toward the rear of the building. His\nshoes crunched on broken glass. Lott was right behind him,\nKenjo and Sim on either side, but he still felt like a student\nfrom the back of the classroom suddenly called up to the\nblackboard to face a question alone. The gems embedded in\nthe hilt of his talon knife streamed hot, tense jade energy into\nhis body. He could feel its bright currents swirling in his gut,\nthrumming up and down his arms and legs, swimming through\nhis head. He held the energy coiled, ready to Steel or Deflect,\nto spring into motion with Strength and Lightness. Perception\nwas Niko’s weakest discipline, but he strained it forward and\npicked out four men waiting behind the closed door, their\nenergies burning an alarming, murderous crimson.\nHe tensed. This was it. Move.\nA tremendous crashing noise exploded ahead of him. Niko\nlaunched himself forward and kicked the door open; it\nsplintered under his Strength. At first all he could comprehend\nwas a blur of fighting—gunfire, screaming, raging jade auras.\nA man with a gun ran wild-eyed toward him. Before Niko\ncould react, an exiting bullet opened a hole in the man’s\nforehead, pitching him toward the floor.\nLott shoved Niko aside with one arm—to protect him, or\nsimply because he was in the way. The First Fist swept the\nroom with the other arm extended, his Ankev pistol raised and\njade aura blazing like a gasoline fire.\nThen he lowered his weapon and stepped inside.\nNiko pushed himself off the wall. The gunfire had fallen\nsilent. The only sound that remained was an animal-like\nmoaning from a man lying on the floor, clutching his stomach.\nThree other men were on the ground, two of them dead. Ayt\nAto and his cousins were stalking through the room. Sando\nKin was grimacing and clutching a bloodied arm, but his\ninjury didn’t seem serious. Through the rear door that the\nKobens had torn from its hinges, a breeze from the alley\noutside flowed into the building and began to disperse the\nsmell of gunpowder.\nKoben Ashi walked around the grisly scene, shrugged, and\ntossed a smirk at the staring No Peak Green Bones. “Next\ntime, we’ll try to leave a few of them for you.”\nSim retorted, “We took out the trash in the front, you smug\nass,” but it wasn’t said with venom and both men laughed.\nNiko stood rooted in place, talon knife still in hand.\nThe room contained stacked plastic supply bins, a water\ncooler, a fax machine, and a table with an open briefcase and\nseveral stacks of cash, with more bills scattered across the\nfloor by the violence.

Three hard-sided metal cases sat on the\nground. Lott pulled one of them onto the table and tore off the\nlock. Kenjo looked over Lott’s shoulder and made a noise of\nappreciation. Cushioned inside the case were two Fullerton P1\ncarbines with spare magazines and ammunition.\nAyt Ato caught Niko’s eye. “Kaul-jen,” he said, gesturing\nat the prone men on the ground. “Would you be so good as to\ntell us which of these men we came here for?”\nLott’s eyes narrowed at the tone of polite condescension in\nAyt Ato’s voice, but Niko ignored it. He took a close look,\ncomparing the faces to the images he’d seen in the\nphotographs. “Those two,” he said. One of their targets was\nalready dead. He’d been hard to recognize at first, on account\nof his shaved head and part of his jaw having been blown\naway. The other dealer, the Uwiwan, was the gutshot one\nflopping on the floor, his dark face contorted in agony. “Die\nscreaming, you miserable whoreson curs,” he wheezed, trying\nto sit up. “Fuck every last one of you all the way to hell.” He\ncursed them in Uwiwan and Kekonese, spitting every\nprofanity he knew in both languages as blood saturated his\nshirt and pants.\nAyt Ato edged his shiny black shoes away from the\nexpanding pool on the concrete and motioned to his cousin,\nKoben Ashi, who bent down and opened the man’s throat from\nbehind with a talon knife.\nAyt Ato turned to Niko. “It’s not so hard for us to work\ntogether after all. Who says we have to follow the examples of\nour elders?” The man’s arresting eyes were guileless, though a\ntouch of wary curiosity turned up the corners of his shapely\nmouth.\nNiko watched the man walk out of the building to meet the\npolice, who’d arrived as instructed, right on time to avoid\ngetting in the way during the fighting but swiftly enough to\nsecure the area, clean up the scene, and arrest any surviving\naccomplices. Reporters in news trucks arrived seconds later.\nThey pressed in around the Mountain Green Bones, taking\nphotographs and video footage of the confiscated money and\nweapons being handed over to the police.\nA few members of the media spotted the No Peak men\nexiting the pool hall and hurried toward them, eager to be the\nfirst to snap photographs of Kaul Niko and Ayt Ato in the\nsame image. Lott Jin shot them a warning glare. “Not a\nchance,” he snarled, “unless you want to take it up with the\nPillar of No Peak.” That made them back off. Kaul Hilo was\nwell known for being intolerant of the press following anyone\nin the family, especially Wen and Ru, for security reasons, but\nmore generally because he thought they were leeches and\ndisdained the Kobens for pandering to them.\n“Let’s go,” Lott ordered his Fingers. “We’re done here.”"

I don’t think Ayt Ato even drew\nhis weapon. What do we get out of it?”\nLott turned on the Finger with a black glare. “We kept\nthose foreign arms dealers from putting Fullerton machine\nguns into the hands of clanless scum, that’s what we get. Have\nyou forgotten that extremists nearly killed the Pillar and still\nwant to destroy the country? We helped the Mountain in the\nStump today, so Aben Soro will do the same for us in one of\nour territories in the future. Do you remember what it means to\nbe a Green Bone, or do you think we’re out here to get on\ntelevision?”\nKenjo dropped his gaze, chastised. “Forgive me for\nthinking so selfishly, Lott-jen.”\nLott spoke to Niko with blunt reassurance. “Don’t worry\nabout what happened back there. You’ll have plenty of other\nchances, Niko.”\nNiko wished Lott hadn’t said anything. But now he knew it\nwas true, that it hadn’t only been in his head. Everyone really\nwas waiting for him to distinguish himself, to make as much\nof an impression as Ayt Ato. Tonight might’ve been that night,\na moment to repair his reputation after the incident with Kitu,\nbut it hadn’t turned out that way.\nThree other Mountain Green Bones had arrived to help the\nKobens, who were rounding up half a dozen civilians. Four\nmen and two women were kneeling on the glass-strewn\nsidewalk in front of the ruined Tialuhiya Nights pool hall. The\nbartender and two staff members were among them. Some of\nthe people in the line were weeping or pleading with the Green\nBones, others were quiet and resigned, heads bowed. Sando\nKin, his wounded arm roughly bandaged, emerged from the\nneighboring barbershop and deposited the protesting barber on\nthe ground next to the others.\nAyt Ato broke off talking to the press but glanced over his\nshoulder to make sure they kept watching him as he walked\ndown the row of kneeling Uwiwans. Ato looked at each\nfrightened face with concern and disappointment. At last, he\nstopped and declared in a loud, clear voice, “You all worked in\nthe pool hall or in the neighboring shops. You knew the men\nwe came for tonight were criminals and enemies of the clan. If\nyou deny it, every Green Bone here will Perceive your lies.”\nAn interpreter supplied by the police department translated\nthe Fist’s words into Uwiwan through a bullhorn, so all the\nnearby residents and bystanders could hear. “You could’ve\ngone to any Finger with this information, but you chose to\nshelter these clanless dogs in your neighborhood. You’re not in\nthe lawless Uwiwa Islands anymore, where there are no\nconsequences to your actions.”\nLott muttered under his breath, “Here we go with the\ndrama.” He walked back toward the Lumezza, examined the\nbroken taillight, and spat on the ground in disgust.

He got into\nthe car. Sim and Kenjo followed.\n“Extremist elements are like cancer cells in a body. They\nhave to be identified and cut out, and those who feed the\ncancer have to be held to account.” Ato must’ve received\nextensive speech training because he was nearly as good an\norator as his aunt Mada. His smooth face was serious and\ndetermined. Every eye and camera followed him hungrily.\nEarlier in the evening, Niko had wished he could muster more\npersonal dislike for the man. Now he found it easier to do so.\n“If I committed an offense against my clan, I’d cut off my\near and carry that disgraceful scar with me for the rest of my\nlife,” Ato went on. “Anyone who supports anti-clan activities,\nthrough action or inaction, should face their neighbors every\nday with the shame of their wrongdoing, so they’re always\nreminded of the need to better themselves.”\nKoben Ashi held a short steel pipe. As the police translator\nrepeated Ayt Ato’s words in Uwiwan, Koben started up a\nbutane torch and held the end of the pipe in the flame until the\nmetal glowed red. Sando Kin held down the wide-eyed,\nstruggling owner of the barbershop as Koben pressed the end\nof the hot pipe to the man’s cheek. The barber shrieked loud\nenough to waken the dead. The nauseating smell of scorched\nflesh hit Niko’s nostrils. When Sando released the man, he\ndropped to the sidewalk, curled in pain, a perfect circle burned\ninto the side of his face. Koben Ashi reheated the end of the\npipe with the torch and moved on to the next person.\nNiko opened the passenger side door and got into the\nLumezza. Lott Jin’s knuckles were white around the steering\nwheel and his face was a stiff mask. The First Fist was a fierce\nfighter but the sight of cruelty against helpless creatures could\nset him off. Niko had heard a rumor that Lott had once beaten\na fellow Fist for kicking a dog. Lott started the car and threw it\ninto gear, then cursed as he was forced to edge slowly around\nall the other vehicles parked in the street.\nA few reporters from the news trucks jogged after the\nLumezza. “Kaul-jen,” one of them called out to Niko, “will\nyour family follow the Mountain clan’s lead and brand\nclanless sympathizers caught in No Peak territories?”\n“Don’t answer that,” Lott ordered Niko, finally clearing\nthe jam and turning off Banya Street. He hit the gas and they\nsped out of the Stump, back toward No Peak turf. “That goes\nfor all of you. There are four people who can make public\nstatements on behalf of the clan—the Pillar, the Weather Man,\nthe Horn, and the Sealgiver. You’re not any of them.”\n“Neither is Ayt Ato,” Niko observed. He was angry, but\nthe feeling was indistinct and shapeless, sitting in the pit of his\nstomach, inside that green shell of himself, now filled with\nblack doubt."

Prince of a\ntroop of monkeys.”\nNiko didn’t say anything further, but he thought, in a\njarring revelation, Yes, that’s it. Ayt Ato knows he’s a prince.\nLott Jin and Ayt Ato had one important thing in common—\nthey understood who they were supposed to be.\nNiko didn’t feel that way about himself. He had too many\nquestions; he saw too many things that made him uncertain.\nHe didn’t see how he was qualified to be the future Pillar of\nNo Peak for any reason other than bloodline, nor why he\nshould feel compelled to accept that destiny, when anyone\nwith an ounce of logic would know that heredity was not\nenough. He often wondered what he was missing, what he\ndidn’t know, what other possibilities lay behind doors that had\nbeen summarily closed for him when he was too young to\nknow they existed.\nNiko leaned his head against the window and watched the\nstreets of Janloon pass by, filled with vague but intense\ncuriosity and quiet, sullen despair.\nCHAPTER\n32\nPassages\nthe nineteenth year, eighth month\nT\nhe Temple of Divine Return was full of people, almost all\nof them Green Bones of the Mountain clan. All the cushions\nwere already occupied; Shae slipped into the back row and\nknelt on the floor. She was wearing a broad summer hat and\nsunglasses so the lower-ranked clan members kneeling nearest\nto her at the back of the sanctum didn’t recognize her, and\nthere were so many jade auras in the building that she\nexpected one more to go unnoticed. Even so, across all the\nrows of heads, she caught sight of Ayt Madashi at the very\nfront. As her gaze landed on Ayt’s back, the Pillar turned\nslowly over her shoulder to look into the crowd of faces\nbehind her. Perhaps Shae only imagined that Ayt had\nPerceived her entrance, that with narrowed eyes she was trying\nto spot Shae in the shadowed corner of this room where they\nhad faced each other so fatefully in times past. Ayt’s face was\ndusted white and a white silk scarf was tied around her neck,\nhiding the ugly scar that Shae knew to be underneath.\nAyt Mada turned back toward the front and took up the\nchant of the penitents.\nShae whispered along with everyone else in the temple,\nreciting the Scripture of Return’s promise that virtuous souls\nwould one day ascend to godliness and reunite with their\ndivine kin in Heaven.\nPerhaps she should not be here. She was not a member of\nthe Mountain or even a respectful outsider. She had not known\nor loved Nau Suenzen. She’d been his enemy and would’ve\nsent him to the afterlife herself if given the chance during his\ntenure as Horn.

He’d\nbeen the Ayt family’s most loyal and cunning assassin for fifty\nyears; he’d slit the throats of Shotarian generals, of Ayt\nMada’s brother Eodo, and all the men of the Ven family. And\nShae was certain he’d murdered Chancellor Son Tomarho.\nAfter all that, he’d retired and succumbed not to the blade but\nto respiratory illness at the age of seventy, dying peacefully in\nhis sleep despite all the lives he’d ended so violently.\nShae was not sure he deserved any prayers, but then again,\nshe did not know who did. She prayed for the souls of men\nlike her grandfather, and Yun Dorupon, and Maik Kehn, and\nsurely if it were her or Hilo in the coffin there would be people\nwho would judge them no more deserving of the gods’\nrecognition than Nau Suen. Even though Nau had been her\nenemy, she could not forget the look in his aged eyes that\nafternoon in Anden’s apartment as he held Ayt Mada in his\nthin arms. Shae had never before seen Ayt Mada bow in the\ntemple, but now the Pillar of the Mountain touched her head to\nthe ground, resting it there as the penitents raised their voices.\nI hope you’re in pain. It gave Shae a certain savage\npleasure to think that Ayt could feel loss, that she could mourn\nthe death of a friend. Otherwise, it wasn’t fair; the scales could\nnever be remotely balanced between them. “Let the gods\nrecognize him,” she echoed in a murmur. And why shouldn’t\nthey? On the day of the Return, the gods would never be able\nto sort the deserving from the undeserving without breaking\napart families. They should recognize everyone, flawed as\nthey were, imperfect in the Divine Virtues—or recognize no\none at all.\nShae rose and shuffled out of the memorial service at the\nhead of the exiting crowd. Dozens of cars filled the parking lot\nand every available spot along the streets. Private drivers and\ntaxis were pulling up at the entrance. Shae walked away from\nthe scene and stood on the street corner, watching. Nau Suen’s\ndeath, although undramatic, was still newsworthy. Journalists\nand cameramen waited outside, fanning themselves in the\ncloying heat, trying to catch senior members of the Mountain\nclan as they left the temple.\nA flurry of activity and conversation erupted as Ayt Ato\nexited the temple amid a small throng of his relatives. Clan\nmembers saluted him and approached to offer condolences\neven though the young man had no relationship to Nau\nSuenzen and had been a student at Wie Lon, not even a Finger\nyet, when Nau had retired. He’s so young, Shae thought. Then\nshe remembered with a start that she’d been the same age\nwhen she’d become Weather Man of No Peak.\nA reporter asked Ato a question, and the accompanying\ncameraman focused upon the Fist’s handsome face. “Nau\nSuenzen was a role model for me, almost like a second\ngrandfather,” Ato avowed. “He was full of energy and will,"

The Pillar of the\nMountain was as straight and commanding as ever, but\nwalking more slowly than she used to. Shae wondered if it was\ndue to grief, or if the knife that Ven’s daughter had plunged\ninto her neck had done some irreparable physical harm that\nshe would never make public. Shae pulled down the brim of\nher hat, not that it would make any difference to Ayt’s ability\nto Perceive her, but the woman did not so much as glance in\nShae’s direction. She likewise ignored all the clan loyalists\nwho pressed in to pay their respects and offer condolences.\nInstead, she laid a swift glance of contempt on the scene\naround Ayt Ato, then said something curt that was too quiet for\nShae to hear.\nThe young man stiffened. Shae couldn’t see the expression\non his face as he turned away from the remaining reporters and\nfollowed his aunt obediently toward the waiting cars. Aben\nSoro jerked his head in signal to two of his Green Bones, who\nmoved to politely but firmly disperse the media and prevent\nthem from following. Ayt Mada got into the front of her silver\nStravaconi Primus S6. Ayt Ato got into the back. In minutes,\nthe lingering crowd in front of the temple was gone, leaving\nthe ordinary bustle of a summer afternoon to fill the streets\nstill littered with debris from last week’s parade and fireworks.\nHeroes Day. Truly a fitting time for an old war veteran like\nNau Suen to make his exit from the world.\nShae hailed a taxi and asked the driver to take her back to\nthe Kaul estate. She wondered if Ayt Mada had put her\nnephew in his place because she considered his actions\nshallow and unbecoming of a future Pillar. Ayt knew how to\nuse the media, feeding it information that elevated the\nMountain and was damaging to her enemies, but she didn’t\npander to the press or offer vain sound bites.\nThe Kobens, on the other hand, showed no compunction\nabout appearing on talk shows and engineering photo\nopportunities. Those who’d believed the family’s star would\nfall after the death of the outspoken Koben Yiro had not\naccounted for his widow riding her husband’s martyrdom into\npublic prominence and onto a seat in the Royal Council.\n“It’s comforting to think that Ayt Mada probably finds\nKoben Tin Bett as obnoxious as I do,” Wen had commented\nwith a surprising amount of acidity when she heard the news\nof the election victory. It seemed unlikely to Shae that Ayt\nMada could feel jealous or threatened by the popularity of the\nKoben family, none of them with a fraction of her ability or\nfame as a Green Bone leader.

When Shae\nwalked into the Weather Man’s house, Tia ran into her arms,\nsmearing finger paint all over Shae’s blouse and skirt. “Ma,\nyou’re home! I’m drawing pictures with Da.”\nShae let her daughter lead her into the kitchen, where\nposter paper had been unrolled and taped down on the kitchen\ntable. Colorful, child-sized handprints and much larger adult\nones had been turned into butterflies, birds, and other animals.\n“These small ones are mine and the big ones are Da’s,” Tia\npronounced.\n“I was wondering how your hands got so big,” Shae\nteased.\n“Silly, Ma.” Tia laughed. “Jaya says you’re not funny, but I\nthink you’re funny.”\nWoon came over and shook his head apologetically at the\nsight of Shae’s stained clothes. “It’s washable paint,” he said.\n“I figured the piglet would need a bath before dinner anyway.”\nWhen Woon had retired last year from his role as the clan’s\nSealgiver and passed the position onto Terun Bin, Shae had\nworried her husband was making a mistake. She was skeptical\nthat a man who’d been one of the highest-ranked Green Bones\non Ship Street could possibly be happy finger painting with a\nfive-year-old and packing snacks. But Woon had seemed\ncertain in his decision. “I’ve spent many years being ordered\naround by a tough little woman and managing thankless\ndetails,” he reminded her. “I’m well prepared for this job.”\n“That’s unfair of you,” Shae protested. “I’m hardly little.”\nIn truth, she was jealous of all the time her husband and\ndaughter spent together. Woon had waited for children for so\nlong that he relished being a father, and the reality was that he\nhadn’t recovered as well as Hilo had from the Janloon\nbombing. He was deaf on one side and walked with a slight\nlimp, and Shae knew that as stoic and humble a man as her\nhusband appeared to be, those things hurt his pride and had\nplayed some part in his decision to retire from the demands of\nclan life sooner.\nWoon had not, however, stopped paying attention to issues\naffecting the clan and regularly discussing them with her.\n“Have you seen the news about the Lybon Act?” Without\nwaiting for her answer, he picked up the remote and turned on\nthe television in the living room. KNB’s commentators were\ndiscussing the passage of an unprecedented international\naccord establishing ethical guidelines for military use of\nbioenergetic jade. Eighty-five nations, led by the Republic of\nEspenia and including Kekon, had met at a convention in\nStepenland to condemn and outlaw breeding programs, child\nmilitary camps, forced addiction, and ingestion of ground jade.\nShae wetted a kitchen towel and wiped the paint from Tia’s\nhands as she watched the news.

The ROE\nhad either captured him or offered him sanctuary in exchange\nfor defecting. Molovni, or “Agent M,” as he was now\nfacelessly known to the world, was sitting in Espenian custody\nand would never face justice for murdering hundreds of\nKekonese citizens.\nThe KNB news desk reported that the Ygutanian\nDirectorate had issued a defiant statement characterizing the\nLybon Act as disingenuous Espenian fearmongering. The call\nfor Ygutan to submit to international inspection of its nekolva\nprogram was a bald-faced attempt to impinge on its\nsovereignty, the officials in Dramsk declared. A commercial\ncame on and Woon turned off the television.\nShae rinsed the towel in the sink, staring at the muddy\nwater as it swirled down the drain. “Papi, was I wrong to have\never dealt with the Espenians?” He was the one person to\nwhom she voiced her worst doubts. “I’ve been attacked for it\nso often over the years, but I always thought I was doing the\nright thing for the clan in the long run. I’m not so sure\nanymore.”\nShe’d tried for so many years to walk No Peak down a\ntightrope, benefiting from foreigners without falling prey to\nthem. But ever since the bombing, it seemed to Shae the\ncountry was spinning in a storm, manipulated and abused by\nforces within and without.\nWoon took the towel from her hands and blotted the\nbiggest stain on her shirt. “Foreigners have always come for\nKekon and for our jade,” he reminded her solemnly. “They\nwould be here whether you were Weather Man or not. No one\nelse could’ve done a better job of handling them with No\nPeak’s interests at heart.”\n“Ma, look, Ma!” Tia interrupted, grabbing Shae’s hand and\ntrying to drag her over to the tea party she’d set up for her\ndolls."

Despite longing\nfor more time to spend with her family, Shae sometimes\nwondered if she was even qualified to be Tia’s mother. She\nwas confident she could face nearly any situation on Ship\nStreet, but she was hopeless at meeting the little girl’s\ndemands for friendship stories about every single one of her\ndolls. “You and Da are going to come over to the big house\nlater, and we’ll all have dinner together with some guests.”\n“Who’re we having dinner with? Will there be any other\nkids?”\n“Just Ru and Jaya,” Shae said, although they hardly\nqualified. Jaya was already sixteen, almost a year-seven at the\nAcademy, Ru was a year older than that, and sometimes Shae\nwondered if Niko had ever been a child at all. Tia had no\nsiblings or cousins near her own age.\n“They’re big kids!” Tia objected.\n“You’re getting to be a big kid too.”\nTia shook her head, wide-eyed. “I never want to be a big\nkid.”\n“You don’t?” Shae exclaimed curiously. “Why not?”\nThe girl hugged Shae’s legs anxiously. “Big kids have to\nlearn to fight. When I fell down and got a nosebleed and cried,\nJaya said I have to get used to blood. She says big kids don’t\ncry when they get hurt.”\nPerhaps, Shae thought, it had not been a good idea to ask\nher niece to babysit. Jaya was utterly without tact. Shae\ncrouched down and pulled her daughter into her arms. “Not all\nbig kids are the same. But if you’re worried about it, you can\nstay a little kid for as long as you like. I won’t mind.”\n_______\nShae changed into clean clothes and walked over to the main\nhouse. Ru was doing homework at the dining table, chewing\nthe end of his pencil. Koko lay sprawled under the table at his\nfeet, gnawing a rubber toy. “Hey, Aunt Shae,” Ru said,\nglancing up for a moment before returning his attention to his\ntextbooks. He was in his last year of high school and only a\nfew months away from final exams.\nWen stepped out of the kitchen and pulled the pencil away\nfrom his mouth. “Don’t do that,” she admonished. “It’s a bad\nhabit that makes you look weak and nervous.” Peering into the\nkitchen, where her mother and the housekeepers were\nworking, Shae could see some of the dishes being prepared:\nfish in milk broth, cold sliced pork with pepper sauce, greens\nwith garlic, fried noodles. “Gods forbid our guests think we\naren’t good enough patrons to feed them well,” Wen said.\nShae, who hadn’t experienced a clean house since Tia was\nborn, noticed jealously that the main residence appeared\nimmaculate.

Fresh-cut dancing star lilies, symbolizing\nfriendship, scented the foyer in elegantly tall vases. Wen\nclaimed to have never wanted nor expected the public role of\nthe Pillar’s wife, but she’d nonetheless made herself an\naccomplished hostess.\n“The Pillar and the Horn are in the study,” she told Shae.\nShae walked in to find Hilo and Juen in serious\nconversation. “Lott Jin’s changed a lot since he was a Finger,”\nthe Horn was saying. “He’s diligent and fair with everyone,\nmaybe a little too moody at times and soft at others, but no one\ndoubts his greenness. He takes great care of his mother and\nsiblings. My only small concern is that he doesn’t have a wife\nor children, which seems a bit unlucky at his age.” Juen blew\nout a thoughtful breath. “As a First Fist, however, he’s been\nexcellent, and when it comes to the job of the Horn, he’s the\nbest person for it. It’s your decision, Hilo-jen, but he’s who I\nwould trust.”\nPromoting someone into the highest circle of leadership in\nthe clan was tantamount to making them an honorary member\nof the Kaul family. They would be living on the estate, having\ndinner in the house, brought into the closest confidence. It was\na decision that needed to be made with great consideration,\nand the person’s character was as important as their capability.\n“If you decide you’re not ready to retire after all, just say\nso,” Hilo said to Juen. “You’re only forty-five.”\n“Forty-five is old for a Horn,” Juen said ruefully. “Being\non the greener side of the clan is like living in dog years, you\nknow that, Hilo-jen. My wife and I had barely any time to\nourselves when we were young, not with four children and the\nlife of a Fist, so I always said I would make it up to her later\non.”\n“Then of course you have to keep your promise,” Hilo said\nwith a sympathetic smile. “I’ve watched Lott Jin for years and\nI agree with all you’ve said. I’ll name him as the new Horn at\nyour retirement party.” The Pillar glanced at Shae as she came\nin. “What took you so long?”\nShe hesitated to say she’d been at Nau’s memorial service.\nWhen Hilo had heard of Nau’s death he’d snorted. “Good\nriddance to that old snake. I never met a Horn I liked less. Not\neven Gont Asch, and that bastard killed a lot of my Fists and\nFingers and nearly sent me to the grave. But at least he was\nup-front about it all. Nau Suen was creepy as fuck.”\nInstead of answering, Shae opened her purse and took out\na padded square envelope. She handed it to Juen Nu. “The\nlatest gift from our Espenian friends.” Juen opened the\nenvelope and took out a floppy disk.\n“Espenian friendship,” Hilo said with a grimace, “lasts\nabout as long as a cheap hand job.

Every time we try bringing\nup the issue of offshore mining, they tell us to go fuck\nourselves. Then they turn around with a smile and say they\nwant to help us.”\nTwo ROE military intelligence officers had walked into the\nWeather Man’s office six months after the Janloon bombing.\nThey’d introduced themselves as agents Berglund and Galo\nand seated themselves in front of Shae’s desk. The pale-haired\none named Berglund said, “Ms. Kaul-jen, the Republic of\nEspenia stands firmly with Kekon in the fight against radical\npolitical terrorism.”\nHis Keko-Espenian partner, Galo, removed an envelope\nfrom his briefcase and placed it on Shae’s desk. “The Green\nBone clans have been combating the threat with impressive\nspeed and effectiveness, and we want to help in the effort by\nsharing our information on the Clanless Future Movement.\nOur superiors hope this intelligence will help you to dismantle\nthe CFM.”\n“Why haven’t you shared this with the Royal Council or\nthe Kekonese military?” Shae asked the foreigners.\nGalo leaned forward. “We have an established relationship\nwith your clan. With Cormorant.” She stiffened at the mention\nof the code name the Espenian military had given to her more\nthan twenty years ago. “We trust your clan has no ties to\nYgutanian interests.” The same could not be said for the\nMountain, which possessed both legitimate and illegitimate\nbusiness interests in that country. The two men stood up to\nleave.\nShae put her hands on her desk and rose from her seat.\n“It’s a shame,” she said, her voice as flat as a sheet of ice, “that\nwe didn’t receive this information before hundreds of people\nlost their lives.”\nThe men paused at her office door. Berglund glanced over\nhis shoulder, his washed-out eyes unmoved. “The Janloon\nbombing was a terrible tragedy. We all wish it could’ve been\nprevented, but there’s no reason to cast blame. What’s\nimportant is that we prevent anything like it from happening\nagain, wouldn’t you agree?”\nAfter that, information arrived every so often at the\nWeather Man’s office. The floppy disks contained names of\nClanless Future Movement members and affiliates, addresses\nof safe houses or meeting places, and the identity of\nindividuals and criminal groups suspected to have supplied or\naided the CFM. However, the Espenians were not entirely up-\nfront. Some parts of the files were redacted, no doubt because\nthey named Espenian agents. There was also never any\nmention of the Ygutanian nekolva, or a man named Molovni.\nShe passed the information she received on to Juen Nu,\nwho combined it with knowledge gathered from his own\nimpressive network of spies. When Juen had become the Horn,\nShae had not considered him to be a leader with much\npersonal presence compared to Hilo or Kehn.

He’d distributed\nresponsibility, expanded the clan’s technical capabilities, and\nvastly improved its network of informers. He was a key reason\nefforts to crush the clanless were going well. Prudent and\nunsentimental, he coordinated operations with the Mountain\nbut never trusted them; he triple-checked everything himself.\nAben Soro of the Mountain commanded more people and was\na more visible Horn, but No Peak was more tightly run. Lott\nJin would have a sizable shadow to fill.\nJuen slipped the floppy disk back into the envelope. “The\nEspenians aren’t giving us much of anything we don’t already\nknow these days. The early stuff was detailed and useful. It\nmust’ve come from spies inside the CFM. Now it’s mostly\nconjecture and weak links.”\nShae said, “I’m still getting phone calls—from within the\nclan, from the press, and from our people in the Royal Council\n—asking about our stance on branding.”\nJuen snorted. “It’s ineffective. More of a hollow publicity\nstunt than anything else.”\nShae personally thought the practice, though popular, was\ncruel and pointless and usually directed at immigrants, but it\nwas her job as Weather Man to point out the ramifications of\nevery decision. “There are people who say we’re not following\nthe Mountain’s policy because of pride or softness.”\n“Those people are shortsighted fools. Branding clanless\nsympathizers only makes it easier for them to find one another\nand gives them more reason to feel unified in their enmity\ntoward society. And those who are wrongly branded are going\nto be driven into the Clanless Future Movement even if they\nweren’t in it to begin with.”\nHilo laced his hands behind his head, slouching into his\narmchair as he considered the issue. “Juen is the Horn. I trust\nhis judgment. People who help the clanless should be\npunished, but there’s no reason our Fists have to follow\nexactly what the Kobens do in Mountain territory.” Juen\nnodded, satisfied by the verdict.\nShae sat down in the remaining empty armchair. She\nthought about what she’d seen earlier in the afternoon outside\nthe Temple of Divine Return. “I doubt even Ayt Mada fully\nbelieves in the Kobens’ methods,” she mused. “She’s\npartnered with barukan and Uwiwans and Ygutanians in the\npast. She’s brought outsiders into the Mountain clan. She’ll\nwork with foreigners so long as doing so serves her goals, but\nthe Koben family targets and opposes them on principle.”\n“Ato is a young and popular traditionalist,” Juen pointed\nout. “Ayt Mada will be sixty in another couple of years and\npeople will start wondering when she’ll retire. If she’s\nplanning to name Ato her successor, she has to let him show\nsome of his own strength.” The Horn pursed his lips. “Maybe\nshe’s willing to let the Kobens have their way in certain things,\neven if it antagonizes some parts of her clan, so long as they\ncontinue to support her while they wait their turn.”"

The old\nbitch will be worse than Grandda—let the gods recognize him\n—hanging on to power until it’s pried from their withered\nclaws.” He ignored Shae’s remonstrative glare for his\ndisrespect toward their grandfather. “Ayt’s using the Kobens\nthe way she uses everyone. Wiping out the clanless is the thing\nwe can all agree on right now. But she won’t let the Kobens’\nzeal endanger the Mountain’s foreign businesses or barukan\nalliances. As long as she keeps her nephew waiting, she has\nthem on a leash.”\nAnd thank the gods for that. Shae nursed the fear that a day\nwould come when she would deeply regret saving Ayt Mada’s\nlife, but for now, she was grudgingly glad their old enemy\nlived and continued to rule the Mountain. Wiping out the CFM\nwas one thing, but the Kobens epitomized a broader\nreactionary backlash that, if unchecked, would lead to equally\nextreme policies—closing trade, expelling foreigners, more\ndraconian measures against anything perceived as anti-clan\nthinking.\nThere was a knock on the door of the study. Wen came in\nwith her hair pinned up in an elegant coil and wearing a high-\ncollared forestgreen dress that made Shae abruptly self-\nconscious about not changing into something nicer or\nrefreshing her makeup. “Our guests from Toshon are here,”\nWen said.\nHilo, Juen, and Shae stood up to greet Icho Dan, the Pillar\nof the Jo Sun clan, who entered the room with his Weather\nMan and his Horn. Jo Sun’s former Pillar and Weather Man\nhad both been killed in the Janloon bombing. Since then, Icho\nhad valiantly tried to fill his brother-in-law’s position as best\nhe could. But even though he was a competent leader, he had\nhealth problems that made it difficult for him to wear jade, and\nno one could run the business side of their clan as well as the\nformer Weather Man. That was the weakness of the minor\nclans. Many of them did not have a deep pool of talented\nGreen Bones and losing their key leaders was a death\nsentence. In the years following the Janloon bombing, some of\nthe minor clans had combined with each other or been\nabsorbed by one of the major clans. The Black Tail clan in\nGohei had been peacefully annexed by the Mountain last year.\nIcho Dan had begun discussion with No Peak six months ago.\nToday, the Jo Sun clan would cease to exist.\nThe big clans were getting bigger. We’re still two tigers,\nShae thought grimly, eating all we can before we have to face\neach other again.\nIcho was dressed in his best suit and tie, and his voice was\nresolute but sorrowful as he said, “Kaul-jen, I’ve been"

His Weather Man and Horn knelt behind him on\neither side, mirroring Shae’s and Juen’s positions next to Hilo.\n“The Jo Sun clan belongs to you now, Kaul Hiloshudon. Its\njade is your jade. Its businesses will report to your Weather\nMan, its warriors will die for your Horn. Your enemies are my\nenemies, your friends are my friends. I surrender the title of\nPillar and pledge allegiance solely to No Peak. The clan is my\nblood, and the Pillar is its master. On my honor, my life, and\nmy jade.”\nThere were tears in Icho’s eyes as he touched his head to\nthe carpet of the Kaul study. The other leaders of Jo Sun did\nthe same, with dignity and resignation. When Icho\nstraightened up, Hilo drew the man to his feet and embraced\nhim warmly. “It’s a hard thing you’ve done, maybe the hardest\nthing a man can do, to sacrifice his own pride, even if it’s for\nall the right reasons, even when there’s no other choice. The\nGreen Bones of the Jo Sun clan are now Green Bones of No\nPeak. I’ll treat them no differently than my own warriors. And\nthe city of Toshon is now No Peak territory. We’ll make it\nprosperous and defend it as fiercely as any district here in\nJanloon.”\nShae could see that the poor man did not entirely believe\nHilo’s words, but he nodded gratefully. “Thank you, Kaul-\njen.”\n“Now that the hard part’s over, let’s all have a good dinner\ntogether,” Hilo said, putting a hand on the man’s shoulder.\n“Tomorrow when you wake up, maybe you’ll still be sad, but\nmaybe you’ll also feel better, knowing you’re finally free from\na difficult job you never asked for, and proud that you did all\nthat your brother could’ve expected.”\nCHAPTER\n33\nTruthbearers\nA\nrt Wyles, CEO of Anorco Global Resources, resided for\ntwo weeks of every second month in his house in Kekon.\nWyles had six houses around the world.

The sea was a chalky gray this morning and flat as\na sheet, with not a cloud or wave in sight. Perfect conditions.\nOffshore jade mining was poised to make Wyles a great\ndeal of money, but it was a risky venture. The initial capital\ninvestment had been enormous, and the Kekonese—more\nspecifically, the Janloon clans that held real power in the\ncountry—were touchy about bioenergetic jade being extracted\nor used by outsiders. Touchy was too mild a word, Wyles\nadmitted. Murderous was more accurate.\nThe clans had repeatedly sabotaged his ships, causing\nserious delays and millions of thalirs’ worth of property\ndamage. The Kekonese were a brutal race; Wyles did not rule\nout the possibility they might try to assassinate him. He was\nundeterred. One did not rise from a rough working-class\nneighborhood in Port Massy to the highest levels of the\nEspenian plutocracy without a stubborn determination and an\nunhealthy appetite for risk. He possessed vast wealth,\npowerful friends, and most importantly, an unwavering faith in\nGod and the Truth. Together, those great weapons would not\nonly protect him, but guarantee his eventual success.\nQuality bioenergetic jade was so rare and valuable that\neven a modest amount could return on the high operating\ncosts. After years of research and development, of failures and\nrefinement, his ships were finally churning and sifting through\nenough seawater, sand, and gravel to extract a profitable yield.\nAnorco was the sole legitimate non-Kekonese processor of\nbioenergetic jade in the world. The thought made Wyles’s\nheart race.\nThere was another reason Wyles spent so much time in\nKekon and it made his heart race in a very different way. Her\nname was Lula. As Wyles set down his binoculars and stepped\naway from the window, an even more lovely view came into\nhis vision, drifting into the room in a lavender silk dressing\ngown tied loosely around her waist, leaving exposed the\nmilky-pale skin of her breasts and stomach. She set a tray of\nbrunch down on the table. A basket of freshly baked yellow\nbuns, soft as pillows, steamed enticingly. The fruit on top of\nthe bowls of egg custard was arranged into the shapes of\nflowers.\n“Come,” Lula coaxed him. “Let’s eat.”\n“You spoil me,” Wyles told her with a smile. He opened\nthe front of her gown and trailed his hands over her breasts,\nflicking his thumbs over the nubs of her nipples. Lula was the\nmost exquisite specimen of a Kekonese woman he’d ever laid\neyes on, and he considered himself a connoisseur of\ninternational beauty. The town center on Euman Island was\nfull of brothels catering to Espenian servicemen, but even\nthough Wyles spent many weeks away from home, he never\nconsidered dipping into the common well with the navy boys.\nHe was a wealthy man with refined tastes, fifty-two years old,\na global traveler who’d sampled what the world had to offer in\nfood and art and women.

His mistress was a\nformer runway model who’d graced the covers of all the\nfashion magazines. So it took a special class of woman to\ncatch and hold Art Wyles’s attention.\nHe’d first seen Lula at a private dinner held for the\nEspenian ambassador. She and four other courtesans had been\nbrought in for the event, but Lula stood out among the other\nwomen like a swan among geese. The demure sequined black\ndress she’d worn showed off every curve of her taut, youthful\nbody. Her face had the radiant glow of a moonlit lake, framed\nby glossy waterfalls of darkest ink. She sang and danced with\nunearthly grace and beauty. Wyles knew at once that he had to\nhave her, but he was afraid his expectations could not possibly\nbe met. He needn’t have worried. Sex with this island angel\nwas transcendent, pleasure on another dimension.\nWyles quickly arranged to have an exclusive arrangement\nwith Lula. Whenever he came to Kekon, he phoned her three\ndays ahead so she could prepare for his arrival. She lived with\nhim in his house on Euman Island, prepared his meals, and\nshared his bed every night. When he traveled back to Port\nMassy, she was free to return to Janloon to visit her family or\ngo shopping with the allowance he gave her. She could speak a\nbit of Espenian and was quickly picking up more. She was\nperfectly agreeable, considerate, anticipating his needs, but\nnever demanding. Wyles sighed. You could not find a woman\nlike Lula in Espenia.\nThey sat down to enjoy their meal, and afterward, Wyles\nsaid, “My sweet, I’m expecting a visitor this afternoon, and\nI’m afraid we’ll be talking business for hours. Why don’t you\ngo shopping or to the gym?”\nLula stood and leaned over to give him a kiss. “I wait for\nyou, Arto-se.” He loved the way she said his name, Kekonese-\nstyle; in her delicate mouth it was so arresting. Picking up the\nempty tray, she slipped out of the room on noiseless, slippered\nfeet.\nWyles went into his library with a fresh cup of coffee and a\nnewspaper while he waited for his guest to arrive. The phone\non his desk rang. When he picked it up, Joren Gasson’s reedy\nvoice said, “I hear congratulations are in order, Artie.”\nWyles shifted uncomfortably, glad the man on the other\nend of the line couldn’t see his expression. “News sure travels\nfast.” Of course Gasson, with all his connections and one ear\nalways to the ground, would be among the first to hear of\nanything that might affect him, even if it wasn’t yet public.\nWyles had hoped to at least tell his wife and children before\nfielding this inevitable call.

Not shabby at all.” The Munitions Society was one of\nthe largest and most powerful Trade Societies in Espenia. As\nits president, Wyles was guaranteed to have access to the\npremier and influence over politicians in the National\nAssembly. “We’ve come a long way, haven’t we?”\n“We sure have.” Wyles looked at his watch; he wanted to\nget Gasson off the phone.\n“We’ve been friends for—what, now? Twenty-five years?\nSometimes, it’s a wonder to think I was there at the start, I was\nthe first person to say, ‘That Art Wyles is going somewhere.’\nI’ve always had a knack for betting money on a sure thing.”\n“I’ll never forget what you’ve done for me over the years,\nyou know that. Listen, I’ve got an important meeting in a\ncouple of minutes. It’s about the jade business. How about I\ntalk to you later?”\n“Sure, Artie,” Gasson said. “I only called to say how proud\nI am.”\n“Thanks, Jo Boy. That means a lot to me.” After he hung\nup, Wyles let out a sigh of relief. He knew he was only one of\nmany people on the payroll of the Baker Street Crew, just as\nJoren Gasson, who effortlessly straddled the legitimate and\nillegitimate spheres of business and politics, was only one of\nhis many stakeholders—both an asset and a liability. Wyles\ntried to keep Gasson in the background as much as possible.\nRight now, he had more important things to think about.\nWith characteristic military precision, Jim Sunto arrived\nright on time. The armed guards that protected Wyles’s house\nlet Sunto pass; they were, after all, employees of Sunto’s\ncompany. Wyles had made a sizable investment in Ganlu\nSolutions International during its early days and become its\nfirst major client. GSI provided security for all of Anorco’s\noffshore mining operations as well as a personal security detail\nfor Wyles himself.\nWyles stood to meet his guest. “Jim, it’s good to see you.\nThanks for coming out to my place. I thought it would be best\nto have this conversation in a private setting where we won’t\nbe overheard.” He motioned the ex-Angel into a chair.\n“What’ll you have to drink?”\n“A spot of whiskey, if you’ve got any northern brands,”\nSunto said.\n“Of course I do,” Wyles said, pulling out a bottle from one\nof his favorite distilleries in Cape Glosset on the shore of\nWhitting Bay. “After all this time here, you haven’t converted\nto hoji?”\nSunto took the glass that Wyles offered and sipped\nappreciatively. “I suppose that makes me a failed repatriate.\nWhat’s on your mind, Art?” Sunto was that kind of person,\nalways straight to the point. “There hasn’t been much trouble\nlately.

        "text": "lately. Sabotage attempts have fallen off dramatically.” Since\nthe Janloon bombing, the Green Bone clans had been too busy\nsuppressing anti-clan elements to keep up their attacks on\nAnorco assets and facilities.\nWyles waved the issue away as he poured a glass for\nhimself. “Those sword-wielding clan thugs are a local\nproblem.” He settled himself into the leather armchair across\nfrom his visitor. “The spread of Ygutanian influence and the\nblasphemy of Deliverantism, on the other hand—that’s a\nglobal threat.”\n“Seer forbid the lies of the unTruthful,” Sunto said firmly.\n“May we all see and bear the Truth,” Wyles added. Both\nmen lifted the Dawn of Icana pendants hanging around their\nnecks and touched them to their lips. Devout Truthbearers\nunderstood that the Slow War with Ygutan was not only an\neconomic or military conflict, but a spiritual one. The\nDeliverantists, led by the Ygutanian religious order of the\nProtecks, sent missionaries all over the world to preach their\nreligion of austerity, claiming that the known Truth was\nincomplete and would be revealed by Ygut visionaries, among\nother heretical beliefs.\nThe missionaries did not travel alone. According to\ninformation obtained by ROE military intelligence, nekolva\nagents advanced their nation’s unTruthful agenda far beyond\nits borders. The specially trained, bioenergetic jade-enhanced\nagents spied for their masters in Dramsk, carried out\nassassinations, and supported and supplied pro-Ygutanian\nuprisings.\nWyles said to Sunto, “I’ve been having some very\ninteresting discussions with officials in the War Department.\nWhat do you know about Operation Firebreak?”\nSunto’s eyebrows rose. He sat back and crossed his arms.\n“Only rumors that I heard on my way out of the Angels,” he\nsaid slowly. “Supposedly, it was a secret program approved by\nPremier Galtz during the Oortokon War to combat Ygutanian\nexpansion wherever it occurred in the world.”\nWyles chuckled. “At this point, it seems to be the most\nwell-known secret in the military. Operation Firebreak\ninitiated covert operations in places as far apart as north Tun,\nKrenia, and Sutaq, partnering with local allies to repel\nDeliverantism and Ygutanian influence.”\nSunto nodded, arms still crossed. “What does this have to\ndo with us?”\nWyles smiled. He liked Jim Sunto. He knew some people\nin the top brass of the ROE Navy and in the halls of the\nNational Assembly who would never fully trust or accept\nSunto because of his Kekonese ancestry, but they were racists.\nWyles believed that devotion to the Truth superseded\neverything, including the color of a person’s skin and the\nblood in his veins.\nWyles said, “Premier Roburg is cutting funding and\nresources for Operation Firebreak.”\nAn immensely disappointing decision for the ROE military\nand the Church of One Truth, but an unsurprising one. Bad\npress over the rates of mental illness and drug addiction\namong Oortokon War veterans had caused the government to\nscale back its emphasis on equipping soldiers with jade and\ntraining them in IBJCS.

Given the economic downturn, voters\nwere opposed to the idea of committing to more overseas\nwars, and the National Assembly was pressuring Roburg’s\nadministration to bring troops home. “As you can imagine,”\nWyles added, swirling the glass of whiskey under his nose and\nlooking none too concerned, “this puts the War Department in\na conundrum.”\n“In other words, they won’t be buying as much\nbioenergetic jade from Anorco as you’d hoped.” Sunto gave\nWyles a shrewd look. “But if I know you, Art, you’ve already\nfigured out a way to make the shifting political winds blow a\nfew hundred million thalirs into your pocket.”\n“And yours as well,” Wyles replied. “Operation Firebreak\nis going to be scaled down, at least officially. But even if the\nNational Assembly and the Espenian public lack the political\nwill to fight the proselytizing of the Ygutanian Protecks, there\nare devoted Truthbearers in the War Department and in the\nMunitions Society and, confidentially, in the Premier’s Office\nas well. Men of reason who won’t let shortsightedness put the\nworld at risk of being overrun by unTruthful ways.”\nWyles handed Sunto an envelope. With curiosity, the\nformer soldier removed the pages inside and began to read.\nThe man’s face remained composed as he took in the meaning\nof the contents, but the rapid rustling of the pages soon\nbetrayed his excitement. “Is this …”\n“A confidential memo from the secretary of the War\nDepartment, authorizing the engagement of private military\ncontractors in Operation Firebreak.” Wyles sipped from his\nglass tumbler with a smile.\nSunto looked up from the papers, stunned. “Art, this is a\nhuge step. Maybe too huge.”\n“It’s our big break, Jim,” Wyles said. “There’s only one\nPMC with jade-equipped, IBJCS-trained personnel capable of\nfulfilling this government mandate, and that’s GSI.”\nSunto slowly folded the memo and returned it to the\nenvelope, staring awestruck at it in his hands as if it were the\noriginal scripture of the Seer. “I always knew that once I got it\noff the ground, there would be demand for GSI’s services.” He\nstood and paced back and forth in front of Wyles’s\nbookshelves, his brow knitted as he absorbed the implications.\n“This is what I hoped for all along, but it’s happening sooner\nthan I expected. I’ve been building GSI and taking on clients\ngradually. I don’t have enough qualified people, equipment, or\nbioenergetic jade for an operation of this scale.”\nWyles steepled his fingers. “I’m prepared to put another\nthree hundred million thalirs into GSI.”\nSunto broke into a cough. When he recovered, he\nexclaimed, “That would make …”\n“GSI a subsidiary of Anorco Global Resources. I’m\noffering to buy you out, Jim. You’d remain president and\nCEO, of course.” He gestured out the window toward the\nAmaric Ocean where his ships were churning the seafloor."

You’d remain president and\nCEO, of course.” He gestured out the window toward the\nAmaric Ocean where his ships were churning the seafloor.\n“Anorco has the capital and the jade. GSI has the expertise and\npersonnel. Together, we have a vertically integrated private\narmy. One that’ll make us rich, but even more importantly,\nbeat back encroaching unTruth around the world.”\nJo Boy Gasson was not the only one with a knack for\nputting money on a sure thing. With the acquisition of GSI,\nWyles’s conglomerate would own the means of procuring jade\nas well as soldiers with the ability to use it. And, as president\nof the Munitions Society, Wyles would possess the political\nconnections and influence in Adamont Capita to make wars\nhappen. “I realize this is a lot to digest,” Wyles said. “But my\nadvice is that you start stepping up your recruitment efforts.”\n“God, Seer, and Truth,” Sunto muttered. He held out his\nwhiskey glass. “Let’s have another drink.”\nCHAPTER\n34\nUnreasonable\nthe twentieth year, second month\nO\nur college student gets to pick first,” Hilo announced,\nbrushing aside Jaya’s quick reach toward the plate of sticky\nfruit cakes that Wen placed in the center of the dining table.\n“Ru’s the one we’re celebrating tonight. Go on, son, take the\none you want.”\nRu elbowed his sister out of the way and chose the peach\ncake. “Good choice,” Hilo said, putting an arm around Ru’s\nshoulders. “Always go for the best.” The teenager grinned\nblearily. His high school graduation ceremony had been\nyesterday, and he’d woken up around noon after a night of\npartying with his classmates. Tonight’s dinner had been a\ncelebratory meal with all of Ru’s favorite foods—short ribs\nwith red pepper sauce, shrimp cake, crispy fried green beans—\nand now the new graduate was too full to even finish his cake.\nKoko sat eagerly thumping his tail and eating morsels that Ru\nsnuck him under the table.\nAfter the upcoming New Year’s break, Ru would enter Jan\nRoyal University. The campus was less than thirty minutes\naway by subway, but Ru had decided to live in student housing\nto get the full college experience. Hilo understood. At\neighteen, the young man needed to break away from his\nparents. He was the only one of his siblings and cousins not to\nhave lived at Kaul Du Academy. Nevertheless, the thought of\nhis son moving out saddened Hilo. Ru was the most agreeable\nof his children. He didn’t have moods like Niko or a temper\nlike Jaya. He got along with everyone and only ever ran into\ntrouble as a result of jumping at ideas without entirely thinking\nthem through, which was natural for a teenage boy.\nOccasionally he clashed with his mother, but only, Hilo\nthought, because Wen was too hard on him. Overall, he was a\njoy to have around; it would be too quiet without him.\n“Ma, do you want dessert?” Wen asked her mother-in-law.\n“No, give more to the kids.

I’m going to watch television\nand go to bed.” Kaul Wan Ria rose creakily from her chair and\nSulima helped her out of the room. Hilo’s mother was still in\ngood health at age seventy-eight, but her hair was completely\nwhite and she seemed to be shrinking and softening, fading\neven further into the background that she had always\noccupied. His grandfather had aged into a leathery cobra\nspitting venom, but his mother was causing no one any\ntrouble.\nWen asked Ru, “Have you thought any more about what\nyou’re going to study?”\n“Aunt Shae suggested a business degree,” Ru said. “She\nsays that’ll open up a lot of job options in the Weather Man’s\noffice and in our tributary companies.”\n“Your aunt’s very smart and practical,” Wen pointed out.\n“A lot of the course requirements in business look boring,\nthough,” Ru said. “The social sciences seem a lot more\ninteresting to me. Sociology, or public policy, maybe. It’s not\nthat I don’t want to work in the clan,” he added quickly, “but I\nwant to do something that helps people outside of the clan too\n—like other stone-eyes.”\nRu could be a bit too optimistic and unselfish for his own\ngood, but Hilo said encouragingly, “I’m sure you’ll do well in\npolitics or law or whatever you put your mind to. You’ve got\ntime to figure it out, that’s what college is for. And your\nbackup plan can be making it big as a movie star like Danny\nSinjo, since you’ve got your mother’s good looks.”\nJaya burst out laughing, catching a spray of cake crumbs in\nher hand.\nWen shook her head, smiling. “Everyone knows who Ru\nlooks like.”\n“Da, come on,” Ru said.\n“Don’t roll your eyes at me,” Hilo said, teasing, but with\nan undercurrent of seriousness. “And don’t ever let any\nsuperstitious asses stand in your way. You’re my son. You’re a\nKaul. If you’re not a Green Bone, it means you’re meant to do\nsomething else, something great.”\n“Yeah, okay, Da,” Ru said, waving his father off, although\neveryone could see how much Hilo’s words made him glow.\nHe prodded Niko. “Hey, maybe next year, we’ll be on campus\ntogether.”\nNiko glanced at his brother, then back down at the napkin\nhe was twisting into a knot. “I think you’re the college kid in\nthis family, Ru.”\n“What do you mean? You’re still going to go to Jan Royal\nafter you’ve spent a year as a Fist, right?”\nJaya tried to catch Ru’s eye and cut him off with a warning\nhand motion, but it was too late. The conversation came to a\nsudden icy halt. Ru looked around, confused. He wasn’t well\nconnected into the military side of the clan, and he’d been so\nbusy with final exams and graduation that he hadn’t heard the\nnews that the Horn had given out rank promotions and jade a\nweek ago.\n“I’m not going to be a Fist,” Niko said. “And I’m not\ngoing to college either.”"

You just need to put in the effort. By now, you should be\ntaking more initiative, setting an example for junior Fingers.\nYou can’t expect to become a Fist by doing the average\namount.”\n“A college education is important these days, of course,”\nWen added, “but it can wait another year or two until you’ve\nearned more jade. Even if you’re a little behind on rank\ncompared to where you expected to be, you can catch up if\nyou put your mind to it.”\nNiko remained mute, as was his habit when he was upset.\nWhen criticized or disciplined, Ru would cajole and argue;\nJaya would storm off in tears. Niko would withdraw, as he was\ndoing now, staring sullenly at the table with his jade aura\npulled in like a black cloud. Hilo felt his temper rising. “Do\nyou think everything should come easy to you just because\nyou’re the Pillar’s son? That you don’t have to work as hard to\nprove yourself and can get away with disgraceful stunts, like\nthat thing with the car?” Hilo caught himself; he’d already\npunished his nephew for that incident and had promised\nhimself he wouldn’t continue to bring it up.\nInstead, he said, in a calmer voice, “Did you know that\nwhen I first met Lott Jin, I wasn’t sure about him? It’s hard to\nbelieve now, but when he was young, he was badly behaved,\nhe sulked and talked back. His father was a top Green Bone\nand he hated following after him. Fortunately, he found his\nown footing. He changed his attitude and worked harder than\nanyone. Now he’s the Horn of the clan. My point is that even\nif you didn’t have the best start, even if you made some\nmistakes, it’s not too late to turn things around. You just have\nto commit to doing it.”\nNiko looked up. He’d been avoiding meeting his uncle’s\neyes, but now he said, “I mean it. I’m not going to be a Fist,\nand I’m not going to college either. I got a job offer outside of\nthe clan and I’m taking it.”\nComplete silence fell over the dinner table. Even Jaya was\ntoo astonished to comment. Hilo blinked as if Niko had spoken\nin a foreign language. In disbelief, “You made this decision\nwithout telling anyone? Without discussing it with your own\nfamily? Instead, you spring it on all of us like this?”\n“What was there to discuss?” Niko said. “I knew you\nwouldn’t agree.”\nHilo wanted to smack his nephew, but Wen put a hand on\nhis arm and he forced himself to take a deep breath. “Despite\nwhat you seem to believe,” Hilo said slowly, “I’m not\nunreasonable, Niko.

If you really wanted to work outside of\nNo Peak you should’ve talked to me and your ma about it.”\nNiko didn’t answer, but his jade aura boiled like a storm in\na bottle. Niko had once been an easy child—calm and\nthoughtful, curious and quick to learn, caring for his younger\nsiblings, not the type to act out. Hilo wondered unhappily\nwhere he’d gone wrong as a parent, how his capable nephew\nhad turned into such an aimless and uncertain young man. Hilo\nmustered every remaining fragment of his paternal patience.\n“Growing up as a Kaul, maybe it’s only natural you’d get\nrestless and want to explore and I haven’t been sensitive\nenough to that. A job outside of the clan could be good for you\nfor a couple of years, give you some additional perspective.\nYour uncle Andy’s a doctor, after all. It’s not a decision you\nshould make without talking to your parents, though. What’s\nthe job, anyway?”\nNiko dropped the crumpled napkin on his empty plate and\npushed away from the table. “I’m joining Ganlu Solutions\nInternational.”\nWen drew in a small, sharp intake of breath, the only\nsound anyone made before Hilo’s arm shot out across the\ndinner table and seized his eldest child by the hair, yanking\nhim bodily out of his chair. A plate crashed to the floor;\neveryone jumped in their seats. Hilo was on his feet. He\nshoved Niko away from him into the nearest dining room wall,\nknocking a framed family photograph to the ground.\n“You signed up to work as a mercenary?” Hilo let out a\nguttural noise. “You’re going to tromp around in places you\ndon’t belong, with thin-blooded, shine-addicted foreigners,\nwhoring your jade abilities to the highest bidder?” He cuffed\nthe side of Niko’s head and shoved him again, towering over\nhim even though the young man was as tall as he was. His\neyes and aura bulged as he shouted. “What kind of a Green\nBone are you? What kind of a son?”\nRu jumped to his feet. Koko leapt up with him, barking.\n“Come on, Da,” Ru pleaded, trying to defend his brother. “He\nmade a mistake, it was a whim.”\n“It wasn’t a whim,” Niko growled, rubbing the sore patch\nof his scalp and squaring to face Hilo with his spine straight,\nshoulders back, and his hands curled into fists at his side. Cold\ndefiance burned in his eyes. “Why do we have to pretend\nwe’re different or better than anyone else who wears jade,\neven if they’re foreigners? Just because of race or genetics? I\ntalked to some recruiters at GSI, and the work sounds\ninteresting. They’re doing something that hasn’t been done\nbefore. All I’ve ever known is the clan, and the only thing I’m\nqualified to do is be a jade warrior. Why shouldn’t I explore\nwhat else is possible? I could travel the world while being paid\nfor my jade abilities.”\nWen said, with a quaver in her voice, “This is what you do\nto your family, after your own brother’s graduation?”\nNiko winced but didn’t drop his gaze. “I’m sorry, Ma,” he"

She whistled low.\n“Shit, you really did it this time, keke.” None of them wanted\nto face their father when he was angry, but their mother\nleaving the room was unheard of.\nThe tone of Hilo’s voice would’ve cowed any of his men.\n“Tomorrow morning you’re going to call Jim Sunto or\nwhoever you’ve been talking to, and say that you acted\nwithout thinking. You’re not going to become a soldier-for-\nhire and disgrace yourself and all of us. You’re going to work\ndirectly under the Horn. You’re going to go to all of your\nscheduled training, and you’re going to make Fist by next\nyear. If you do all that, then we’ll talk about finding you some\nnew opportunity, inside or outside of the clan, because\nobviously you aren’t going to be Pillar.”\nNiko’s face twitched before stiffening. “I’ve made up my\nmind.”\n“Niko,” Ru hissed in distress, looking at him wide-eyed.\n“Don’t you think you’re taking this too far? You’ve made the\npoint that you’re not happy. Da is giving you an out. Don’t you\ncare what our parents think?”\nNiko glanced at his younger brother with a sorrowful\nexpression. “You’re eighteen, Ru. You have your own life and\nyou’re going to college. You don’t need me around.” As he\nturned back to Hilo, his voice dropped and trembled with\nresentment, but he kept his chin raised and his jade aura\nsmoldered with resolve. “As for what my parents think, I\nwouldn’t know what that is. My father was murdered in a clan\nwar and never even knew I existed. You executed my mother\nas a traitor, and I have nothing of her, not even photos. What\nam I supposed to really believe about either of them?” Niko\nturned away for a second, swiping angrily at his face. “What\ndo you think, Uncle? Do you think my parents would want this\nfor me, or would they tell me to walk away while I still can?”\nA spasm seized Hilo’s heart. He put out a hand; it closed\nhard on the back of a chair. For one gut-wrenching second,\nbecause of some slight thing in Niko’s posture or voice, or\nsome subtle aspect of his jade aura, it seemed to Hilo as if the\nyoung man he thought of as his eldest son was gone, and his\nbrother, Lan, stood in the dining room in Niko’s place. Lan, at\nhis most resolutely principled, at one time the only man Hilo\nwould obey.

She fell silent.\nFor a moment, Niko hesitated, as if restrained by an\ninvisible tether. He took the next step firmly, as if pulling\nhimself out of quicksand. Then the next step, and the next. The\ndoor closed behind him, cutting him from sight, but for several\ndrawn-out minutes, Hilo could Perceive the silent pain in his\nnephew’s turbulent aura as it receded from the house.\n_______\nJim Sunto was in his office, on a morning phone call with two\nhuman resources managers from the War Department, when a\nviolent commotion broke out at the gates to GSI’s compound.\nAt first he thought the noise was from a training exercise.\nThen he heard the guards screaming, “Stop! Stop or we’ll open\nfire!” and he didn’t even need his jade abilities to sense their\nalarm.\nSunto dropped the phone and raced out of his office,\ndrawing his sidearm. Bursting out the front doors of the\nbuilding, he took in the scene in an instant. The chain-link\nfence behind the security guard box was standing open; the\nrolling gate had been torn off its sliding mechanism and lay\naskew. Two men in GSI uniforms were lying on the ground—\nstill moving, thank God—and four others were in an armed\nstandoff, shouting, two of them with R5 rifles, the other two\naiming Corta 9 mm pistols.\nKaul Hiloshudon, flanked by four of his Green Bone\nwarriors, strode through the breached fence and advanced\ntoward the building with the heedless implacability of a\ndemon. The nearest GSI guard fired twice at Kaul’s chest.\nSunto could’ve told the man he wasn’t going to hit a skilled\nGreen Bone with a small-caliber weapon from a hundred\nmeters away. With an irritated snarl, Kaul Deflected the\nrounds, and with a lethal rustle, his Fists drew their own\nweapons—Ankev 600 handguns and carbon steel moon\nblades.\n“Hold fire!” Sunto roared at his men. He ran ahead of\nthem, waving his arms. “Hold your fucking fire, Seer damnit!”\nSwitching to Kekonese, he shouted at the intruders, “Kaul, for\nfuck’s sake, do you want a bloodbath?

He came up to me at one of our\ninformation sessions.” Moving slowly, Sunto holstered his\nCorta and held his hands open. “Lower your weapons,” he said\nin Espenian to the GSI guards.\n“Sir—” one of them began.\n“I said lower them!” Sunto had trained with No Peak’s top\nmen and knew what they were capable of. If a gunfight broke\nout, the Green Bones would throw up a veritable hurricane of\ncombined Deflection and close the gap, cutting down men\nwith blades and knives in seconds. “Think about this,” he said\nto Kaul. “Do you want to be held responsible for an\nunprovoked deadly attack on an Espenian company and its\nemployees? Call off your men. We’ll step into my office and\ntalk about this like civilized human beings.”\nIn all the years that Sunto had known the clan leader, he’d\nnever been sure if the stories he’d heard about Kaul Hilo were\ntrue. Now he thought they probably were. He recognized the\nFists who accompanied the Pillar—Lott, Vin, Suyo, and Toyi.\nHe’d spent time with all of them, had taught them and learned\nfrom them, but they would murder him and all his soldiers at a\nsingle word from Kaul. It was no wonder, Sunto thought with\nresentful abhorrence, that Kekonese people were stereotyped\nas savage.\nKaul’s eyes narrowed to slits. He turned over his shoulder.\n“Stay here,” he said to Lott. Sunto let out a silent breath as the\ntension eased, weapons reluctantly coming down on both\nsides. Ever since the two men had ended their friendship, Kaul\nhad not once contacted the ex-Angel or been to the GSI\ntraining facilities on Euman Island, but now he strode past\nSunto and into the building as if he owned the land it was built\non.\nSunto followed. Inside, he pushed open the door to his\noffice. Kaul went in but did not sit down. He gave the\nutilitarian furniture and boxy institutional surroundings a brief,\ncontemptuous glance, clearly every bit as unimpressed as he\nexpected to be. “I warned you to keep your business out of\nKekon,” he said, with the cold disappointment of a man about\nto make good on a threat. “You didn’t listen.”\nSunto walked behind his desk, putting distance between\nthem. “The only thing I’ve done is hold information sessions\nfor prospective hires. That’s not unusual for any company.” He\ncould’ve guessed even that would raise the ire of the clans, but\nhe couldn’t afford to be timid about recruiting. The Operation\nFirebreak contract depended on GSI being able to field enough\nsoldiers. “We’re interested in hiring ex-military personnel, or\nthose with enough private training. We’ve made no effort to\nlure Green Bones from the clans, but we’ll talk with any\ninterested and qualified applicants.”\n“Whatever agreement you’ve made with Niko, break it,”\nKaul demanded. “He won’t be wasting his jade working for"

Well, thin-blooded or not,\nI’m not one of your underlings, Kaul. And GSI isn’t one of\nyour tribute companies. Your son is an adult. I asked him\nseveral times if he was sure of his decision and he assured me\nhe was. He’s already signed the contract and been paid the\nstarting bonus.”\nKaul put his hands on Sunto’s desk and leaned forward\nacross the space between them, lowering his voice. “Behind\nthat Kekonese face, you have a dirty Espenian soul. You\nunderstand money, don’t you? I’ll pay you ten times whatever\nyou’ve already paid him if you withdraw the offer.”\nSunto scowled. “Bribing a company executive to fire an\nemployee is illegal.”\n“Years ago, you told me you weren’t here to cause trouble,\nbut now your soldiers protect the mining ships that steal\nKekonese jade. So don’t bullshit me with moral superiority.”\nKaul’s stare was as steady and chilling as his voice. “You\nknew that by hiring Niko, you would be reaching into No Peak\nand breaking my family. You did it anyway. Anyone else who\ntried to do that, I’d kill them. But out of respect for our old\nfriendship, I’m giving you a choice. Take the money or don’t,\nbut I’m asking you to solve this, as a personal favor to me. If\nthat doesn’t move you at all, at least think selfishly about\nwhether you really want me as an enemy.”\nSunto did not. He’d been born in Kekon and had spent the\nmajority of the past fifteen years in the country. He understood\nhow powerful the clans were and how ruthless their leaders\ncould be. He certainly didn’t consider himself a prideful or\nreckless man who blindly tempted danger.\nThe hard reality, however, was that only three countries\npossessed jade-equipped and trained military personnel—the\nRepublic of Espenia, Ygutan, and Kekon. Most of GSI’s\nemployees were formerly ROE special forces, but he still\nneeded more people. Unfortunately, it hadn’t been as easy as\nhe’d hoped to hire current and former soldiers from the\nGolden Spider Company, some of whom he’d personally\ntrained during his years working with General Ronu to reform\nthe Kekonese military. Green Bones, even those not beholden\nto the clans, were leery of accepting employment with a\nforeign company, and strict attitudes about the acceptable jade\nprofessions persisted in Kekon.\nKaul Nikoyan coming to work for GSI could be the tipping\npoint that influenced other Green Bones. What candidates like\nhim lacked in institutional military experience, they more than\nmade up for with sheer jade ability, and a surge of such\nrecruits would boost GSI’s capabilities within a short time.\nThe No Peak clan could not condemn or punish GSI or those"

All of GSI’s fortunes, his own\npersonal reputation, and perhaps even the fate of the\nTruthbearing world rested on Operation Firebreak. Art Wyles\nwas an insufferably smug oligarch, widely disliked, but he’d\nhanded Sunto the biggest opportunity of his life and was\nvouching for him with the War Department, the Munitions\nSociety, and all of Anorco’s shareholders, including, if rumors\nwere to be believed, certain people in Port Massy whose\ndisfavor Sunto did not want to court.\nSunto also knew that being an Espenian citizen and a\nformer Navy Angel war veteran working for the ROE\ngovernment afforded him a special protection. Kaul might still\nbe reckless enough to try to assassinate him, but he couldn’t\ndo so without risking extraordinary scrutiny and sanction, and\neven that would not bring down GSI. Wyles could hire\nsomeone else to run the company. All things considered, Sunto\ndecided he would sooner take his chances against Kaul than\ndisappoint his Espenian stakeholders, against whom he had no\nsuch advantages.\n“I’d rather not be your enemy, Kaul,” he replied,\nremaining exactly where he was. “But I’m not afraid of you,\neither.”\nThe Pillar straightened. Sunto remembered the first time\nhe’d met the man in the Seventh Discipline gym. He’d\nexpected to end up in the hospital and been confused to find\nKaul amiable, exuding casual arrogance and smiling more than\nSunto would’ve expected from a man with such a reputation.\nThere was none of that now. Sunto thought about the Corta\npistol near his right hand.\n“Maybe you’re right to feel as if you have nothing to fear,”\nKaul said. “I can’t force a foreign company to do what I ask,\nand I know you’re not a man who’s easily cowed or killed. So\nin the short term, this decision may be good for you. But I\nwon’t forget that you threw away our friendship and took my\nown son for your gain.” The jade energy coming off the Green\nBone seemed too bright to be human, though he’d gone very\nstill. “I promise you that sooner or later, I’ll answer that\noffense.”\n“You should consider why your son would want to work\nfor GSI instead of staying in your clan in the first place. The\nGreen Bone clans are becoming obsolete. Even your own\nfamily can see it.” Sunto jerked his chin. “Now take your men\nand get off my property.”\nFor a frightening moment, the expression on Kaul’s face\nsuggested he would resort to the blunt violence with which\nhe’d arrived.

Sunto reached in readiness for his own jade\nenergy. Seconds passed, longer and infinitely more tense than\nthe ones that used to stretch between them when they faced\neach other sparring on the lawn of the Kaul estate.\nThe fire in the Pillar’s eyes shrank behind black coals. “It’s\nobvious you’re not a father, Lieutenant.” Kaul turned toward\nthe door. “Or you wouldn’t feel so invincible.”\nSunto followed at a wary distance and watched as the\nPillar gathered his Green Bones with a gesture and walked\nback out through the broken security gate.\nCHAPTER\n35\nThose with a Choice\nA\ns the wheels of the plane touched down on the tarmac at\nJanloon International Airport, Anden rubbed his eyes and\npeered groggily out the window at a wintry midafternoon sky.\nHis mind was still on the other side of the Amaric Ocean. As\none of the directors of the International Bioenergetic Medicine\nCertification Board, he flew to Espenia at least twice a year to\ninspect clinics for compliance with standards of practice,\nwhich meant he racked up even more air travel miles than the\nWeather Man. At least there was no smoking on the planes\nanymore, and Silver status on Kekon Air meant he made the\ntrip in greater comfort than before.\nThe good news in Espenia was that the medical use of jade\nwas steadily gaining acceptance, helped along by the efforts of\nWBH Focus and the Kekonese Association of Espenia. The\nbad news was that for every positive mention of Kekonese\njade, there were spectacularly negative ones. Jon Remi, the\nBad Keck of Resville, was still growing his power in that city,\nstill eluding death at the hands of rivals and arrest by the\npolice.\n“We’ve tried many times to reason with Remi, to get him\nto take a lower profile,” Migu Sun had explained at the most\nrecent KAE board meeting Anden had attended, “but he won’t\nbe reined in.”\nCory was beyond frustrated. “The Green Bones of every\nother city have cut off association with Remi and his\nSnakeheads gang. We’re cooperating with federal agencies,\ngiving them any information that might help the police take\nhim down. Maybe this is an awful thing to say,” Cory\ngrumbled darkly, “but if he doesn’t get arrested soon, I hope\nhe finally gets popped by one of the Crews.”\nThe problem in Espenia, Anden mused as he collected his\nbaggage, was that there was no loyalty greater than money. In\nKekon, there had always been two sources of power: gold and\njade. No amount of money could make a man a jade warrior if\nhe didn’t have the right blood and training. Even the wealthiest\nman could be killed. If he did not wear jade himself, he needed\nthe friendship of those who did. So there was always a\nbalancing force.\nIn the rest of the world, that was not true. The Kekonese\nAssociation of Espenia was not a clan with the power to\nenforce its wishes across the country.

Anden had a sinking\nfeeling that Jon Remi was the new template for how to\nsucceed as a Green Bone in Espenia. As he rose in wealth and\npower, he would gather followers, others who would seek to\nbe like him.\nThe taxi Anden took from the airport battled holiday\nseason traffic all the way back to his apartment. During the\nlong ride, Anden tried to put pessimistic thoughts out of his\nmind and return his attention to the present. He’d already done\neverything he could to help his friends in Port Massy and to\nadvance No Peak’s agenda in that country. The rest of it was\nout of his control.\nWhen he walked through the door of his apartment, he\nfound Jirhuya sitting on the sofa in the living room, reviewing\nconcept art. “Took you long enough,” Jirhu sighed, putting\ndown his work and unfolding his graceful body from the\ncushions. He came to the door and gave Anden a kiss. Jirhu\nsmelled like soap and aftershave—freshly showered and\nshaved, his coarse, curly hair still damp.\n“The flight was late, and traffic was bad,” Anden\nexplained.\n“Sorry I wasn’t a good enough boyfriend to make dinner,\nmiyan.” It was his pet name for Anden, an Abukei endearment\nmeaning mine. “There wasn’t much in your fridge, and I didn’t\nhave time to get groceries.”\n“That’s okay. We can go out for dinner.” He was not really\nhungry yet; it was early in the morning Port Massy time. “Or\nwe can order in from the Tuni place.”\n“Let’s stay in.” Jirhu put one arm around Anden’s waist.\nWith the other he took Anden’s hand and moved it to his ass.\n“It’s been a long ten days with you on the other side of the\nworld.” He kissed Anden again, more deeply.\nAnden felt his shoulders relaxing, the grogginess of travel\nnudged aside by the stirring between his legs. He dropped the\nbag he was still carrying and tilted Jirhu’s head back to kiss his\njaw and neck, inhaling deeply, pressing his lips into the\ncomforting hollow of the other man’s throat. Jirhu drew him\ntoward the bedroom and he followed, though he could not help\nfeeling a tiny flutter of reluctance. He was always more than\nwilling to give Jirhu what he wanted, but he was also tired\nfrom the flight and tonight he would’ve preferred to receive\nrather than have to perform, or simply to enjoy each other’s\nbodies more relaxedly, with mouths and hands.\nAs if sensing the hint of reticence, Jirhu sat Anden down\non the edge of the bed and unbuttoned his shirt, trailing\nfingertips down his chest and stomach, then crouched between\nAnden’s knees and undid his pants. “Just relax, I’ll do the\nwork.”\nAnden leaned his weight back on his arms and closed his\neyes contentedly, feeling the last of the stress in his body melt\naway into desire as Jirhu skillfully brought him to full arousal.\nWhen the heat of his partner’s mouth drew away and he heard"

Jirhu was already on his hands and\nknees, ready and breathing hard with eagerness. He was a\nbeautiful sight: his long tawny body and smooth back, the\nsweep of his shoulders down to his elegant arms, the firm\nglobes of his ass. Long ago, Cory had taught Anden to take his\ntime, to use his fingers and mouth first, to enter slowly and\ngently, thinking of the way he would want to be treated—but\nJirhu was sometimes surprisingly impatient. He pushed back\nagainst Anden, engulfing him; he grabbed the headboard of\nthe bed and angled his hips upward, thrusting and clenching\nrhythmically. Jirhu talked a lot—a shocking amount, in\nAnden’s opinion, though he found it intensely erotic. He\nordered Anden to bite his shoulder, to grab his hips, to smack\nhis ass, to stroke his cock. When he climaxed, it was with a\nstring of moaning, ecstatic profanities. By then, Anden felt\nstrapped helplessly into a rollercoaster seat. Jirhu moved\nagainst him fiercely and expertly, squeezing him, and Anden\ncareened off the pinnacle, falling onto his boyfriend with a\nshudder.\nThey lay together for a while, enjoying the afterglow of\ntheir reunion. “I was a bit selfish there,” Jirhu admitted\nsheepishly but without apology.\n“I like it when you’re insistent,” Anden assured him.\nPerhaps it was because Jirhu had been with more partners, or\nperhaps, being Abukei, he did not share the same cultural\ninhibitions, but Jirhu seemed to know what he wanted. He was\ndriven, comfortable in his own skin, and not just in bed—in\nhis work and artistic vision, his opinions.\nAnden got up and took a leisurely shower, enjoying the hot\nwater on his back. By the time he got out and dressed, Jirhu\nhad called an order down to the Taste of Tun and takeout\ncontainers of lamb and lentil stew, fried potatoes with herbs,\nand vegetable dumplings arrived a few minutes later. They ate\nat Anden’s kitchen table, knees touching, spooning food from\nthe paper cartons onto each other’s plates.\n“It’ll be nice to have more space soon,” Anden said. He’d\nfound a larger apartment three blocks away, in the same Old\nTown neighborhood, and they were moving in together next\nmonth. He and Jirhu had been seeing each other for a year and\na half. Jirhu had a key to Anden’s place and since it was closer\nto where he worked, he was at Anden’s apartment as often as\nhis own. Still, there had been some disagreement. Anden made\na good income as a doctor and was a naturally frugal person,\nso even with Janloon’s steep housing prices, he could’ve\nafforded a small house, but Jirhu wouldn’t hear of buying a\nhome until he could contribute half of the down payment.

His\nsavings as an artist were paltry, but with all the work he was\nnow doing on Cinema Shore’s growing slate of movies, it\nmight not be long before they moved again.\n“Personally, I’m going to miss this place,” Jirhu said with\na teasing smile. “It’s so much like you.” He gestured at the\ntidy, simply decorated space, the bookcases and shelves Anden\nhad made from plain lumber and painted himself, the heavy\npunching bag hanging in the living room, small objects and\nchildren’s artwork from when his nieces and nephews had\nbeen much younger. In their new apartment, Anden expected\nJirhu and Wen would sweep in and improve everything, bring\nin more attractive furniture, make the drapes and cushions\ncomplement each other.\nAnden said, “The clan New Year’s party is coming up. It’ll\nbe at the General Star Hotel this year, and everyone important\nin No Peak will be there. Would you like to come? I asked the\nPillar if I could bring you and it’s fine.”\nHe said this casually, not wanting to make it sound like a\nbig deal. The truth was that he’d asked Hilo some time ago\nand had been waiting until after his trip to Espenia for the right\nmoment to tell Jirhu. It was one thing for Anden to be sleeping\nwith someone, or even moving in with him. It was quite\nanother to bring him to the biggest No Peak gathering of the\nyear, one hosted by the Pillar himself.\nAfter weeks of delay, Anden had mustered the courage to\nwalk into the Pillar’s study. “Hilo-jen,” he said, trying not to\nsound as awkward as he felt, “I’ve been seeing someone for\nmore than a year now. He’s not a Green Bone or a member of\nthe clan, but we get along well and we’re planning to move in\ntogether. I’d like to bring him to the New Year’s party.”\n“The Abukei fellow,” Hilo said. “Bring him if you like.”\nAnden blinked. He’d expected more questions. “You …\nyou’re fine with it, then.”\nHilo looked up from the towering stack of cards that Wen\nhad left on the coffee table for him to sign. He picked up the\nremote control and muted the television that had been playing\nquietly in the background. “Wouldn’t I have mentioned it\nalready if I wasn’t? Wen told me about him ages ago and\nasked permission on your behalf. She knew you would take\nforever to do it yourself.” He scrawled his name, stamped a\ncard with the clan’s insignia in red ink, and moved on to the\nnext one. “Your personal life’s your own business, Andy,\nunless it affects the clan.”\nIn retrospect, Anden wasn’t sure why he was so surprised\nby his cousin’s nonchalance. Societal prejudice against the\nAbukei had made him anticipate the Pillar’s disapproval.

They were suspected by\neveryone, which made them nearly useless as White Rats, or\nelse they were helpless and protected by aisho. No enemy\nwould find it worthwhile to try to turn or harm them. Jirhuya\nwas a safe partner for Anden. The thought was a relief but also\nmade Anden faintly resentful.\nOutside, a light rain began to patter against the windows of\nAnden’s apartment—a rare winter shower that would slick the\nroads but wouldn’t last long. Jirhuya pushed the remains of his\ndinner around the plate. “Please don’t be offended, but … I’d\nrather not go to the party.” His eyes met Anden’s, then\ndropped apologetically. “I’ve worked too hard making a name\nfor myself to start being seen as the Kaul family’s charity\ncase.”\nAnden was taken aback. “What is that supposed to mean?”\n“The only other Abukei there will be the janitors and\nwaitstaff. How’re you going to introduce me? As your\n‘friend’? It’ll look like I was brought out to show off No\nPeak’s generosity.”\n“That’s not true. I asked the Pillar if I could bring you. It\nwas my idea, not his.” He hadn’t expected to meet resistance\nover something he’d thought would be a welcome thing and\nwas offended that Jirhu would ascribe such superficial motives\nto his family. “You’re not the only one who stands out,” Anden\ncountered. “I’m a mixed-blood orphan adopted by the Kaul\nfamily when I was a child. Does that also make me a charity\ncase?”\nJirhu shook his head. “Your mother and uncles were\nfamous jade warriors; you went to the Academy; you were\nraised by the Kauls. Even though you’re a doctor now, you’re\nstill a Green Bone of the clan. That makes you more Kekonese\nthan me, because no matter your skin color, green is what\npeople see.” Jirhu stood from the table, taking his plate and\ndropping it loudly into the sink. “If you’re Abukei you can’t\nbe green. So you can never be anything but Abukei.”\nAnden hadn’t until now realized how much he’d been\nlooking forward to showing up with Jirhuya in front of the\nwhole clan, knowing that no one would have the audacity to\ntug their earlobes at him in the presence of the Pillar and the\nentire Kaul family. He’d always assumed that a partner who\ntruly cared for him would be happy to be welcomed by his\ncousins. With a surge of hurt, he blurted, “I thought we were\nserious. This is a big No Peak event and I’d hoped you’d be\nthere.”\nJirhu turned around, his hands clutching the edge of the\ncounter behind him. “I’m sorry. I just don’t want to owe\nanything to your family. Or for anyone to think I do.”\n“Who doesn’t owe something to the clans?” Anden\nexclaimed. “Do you think the movie industry would be what it\nis, that you’d have the career you do now, if my sister-in-law"

The clans are in everything. They make\nand break industries and companies and people. I’m already\nluckier than most Abukei.” Jirhuya’s father had died while\ndiving for mine runoff, but he’d been raised by his mixed-\nblood mother and Kekonese grandfather, so he’d been given\nan education and advantages many Abukei did not have.\nJirhu’s voice fell and he sounded uncommonly vulnerable. “I\ndon’t want people saying it’s all because of No Peak, because\nI’m sleeping with you. Please, miyan, try to understand.”\nAnden felt that he emphatically did not understand, and he\nopened his mouth to say so, but at that moment, there was a\nknock on the door. Anden and Jirhu paused their argument and\nlooked at each other in surprise. They weren’t expecting\nanyone. The knock came again, harder this time, sounding\ndesperate.\nAnden opened the door and was surprised to see his\nnephew. The expression on his face was forlorn and distressed,\nand his hair was wet with rainwater that dripped into his eyes.\n“Niko,” Anden exclaimed, pulling him inside. “What’s\nwrong? What’s happened?”\nNiko rubbed the back of his sleeve over his wet face.\n“Uncle Anden, can I stay with you for a while?”\n_______\nAnden went to the Kaul house the following afternoon. The\nfirst person he saw was Jaya, loitering near the gate with two\nAcademy classmates, skateboards tucked under their arms.\n“You might not want to talk to him right now,” she advised.\nJaya normally had some quippy thing to say every time Anden\nsaw her, so he knew it was a sign of how bad the situation was\nthat his niece didn’t even crack a smile. “He’s in an awful\nmood.”\nAnden went inside the house. The thick wooden door to\nthe study was closed and behind it, Anden could hear the\nPillar’s raised voice, and Lott Jin responding, but he couldn’t\nmake out what they were saying. He went into the kitchen and\nopened the cabinet, taking out a glass and a bottle of hoji and\npouring himself a fingerful of drink to strengthen his resolve.\nStanding at the patio door, he looked out into the courtyard\nand gardens and saw that on the lawn, a pile of concrete blocks\nhad been smashed into chunks of rubble and left strewn about,\nsome of them lying several feet away, having clearly been\nflung about in a rage.\nThe door to the study opened and Lott Jin emerged. The\nnew Horn looked as if he’d been badly taken to task. He wore\na tight scowl of chagrin and resentment, mingled with relief\nthat the ordeal was over and he’d gotten away without worse\npersonal consequence. Anden intercepted him. “What’s\nhappening?”\n“Niko’s out,” Lott said. “No rank, bank accounts frozen,\nno help from the clan. The Pillar had half a mind to order him"

Hilo was standing behind the\ndesk, the telephone receiver in his hand and address book\nopen, looking for a number. The knuckles of his hands were\nuntidily wrapped with gauze. At Anden’s entrance, he glanced\nup impatiently and said, “What do you want, Andy?” He\nfound the number he was looking for and began to punch it\ninto the phone.\n“Don’t do this.”\n“Do what?” his cousin snapped.\nAnden walked up to the desk, forcing the Pillar’s attention\nback to him. “This. Raining your anger and guilt down on\nNiko because he isn’t following the plan you had for him.\nPushing him away because you feel rejected and offended by\nthe choices he’s making in his own life. You’ve done it before\n—to me, to Shae, and even to Wen. Gods in Heaven, don’t do\nit to your own son.”\nHilo depressed the phone cradle and slammed the phone\nback down with enough force to make the whole thing jump\non the desk. “He’s not my son,” Hilo snarled. “He was never\nanything like me, not in the least. He’s as melancholy as Lan,\nand as shallow and disloyal as Eyni.”\n“Let the gods recognize them,” Anden added in a murmur.\n“I put up with a lot of bullshit from that boy.” Underneath\nthe angry glare, Anden could see his cousin’s bewilderment\nand pain. “I know he’s young, he needs some freedom to rebel.\nI gave him his head as much as I thought was reasonable. But\nthis beats fucking everything. Wasting the jade and training he\nowes to his family and his clan—to fight for foreigners, for\nstrangers, for nothing but money. Even barukan are better than\nthat. You’re a doctor, Andy. Don’t tell me you agree with what\nhe’s doing.”\nAnden looked at the ground, then back up at the Pillar. “I\ndon’t agree with his choice, but I agree less with what you’re\ndoing by cutting him off.”\n“Don’t try to talk me down, Andy.” There was warning in\nthe Pillar’s voice, a layer of menace that would have, at one\ntime, silenced Anden the way it silenced most men.\n“I know better than to try reasoning with you when you’re\nthis angry.”\n“At least someone has sense,” Hilo said, turning away and\nopening a desk drawer. “Leave me alone, then.

If you disown Niko, you’ll\nlose your son and No Peak will lose its heir.”\n“He’s not fit to be Pillar,” Hilo said.\n“People said that about you once,” Anden reminded his\ncousin. “Niko’s not like you, just like you weren’t like Lan.\nHe’s smart, Hilojen. Observant. He’s always trying to deeply\nunderstand things, but he has to do it in his own way, even if it\nmeans going all the way over to the opposite side. You say\nhe’s cold and selfish, but it’s because he keeps what he feels to\nhimself. He does care. He cares what you think of him. And I\nthink he needs to be free of it too.”\nHilo’s face moved in a brief contortion, but he answered\nwithout sympathy. “What message is it going to send to the\nclan if I let Niko get away with this? A Kaul, joining a foreign\nprivate military company? The Mountain will throw a fucking\nparty. They’ll go to town poaching our Lantern Men and our\npoliticians and our public support. We’ll be eviscerated in the\npress. Even Shae agrees with me. And other Fingers will think\nthat if the Pillar’s son can turn his back on the clan and use his\njade to pad his own pocket, then what’s to stop them from\ndoing the same?”\n“Then do what you have to do publicly. Condemn Niko’s\ndecision. Tell everyone that he doesn’t represent No Peak with\nhis actions, and he has no clan status or privileges so long as\nhe works for Sunto. Say whatever you have to as Pillar. But at\nleast talk to Niko. Don’t turn your back on him.”\n“Why does it matter so much to you?” Hilo retorted, his\npatience visibly fraying.\n“Because it’s what Lan would’ve done!” Anden had not\nmeant to shout. He’d meant to come in and lay down his case\nwith calm and unassailable surety. He closed his shaking\nhands into fists and leaned them on Hilo’s desk, pressing the\nknuckles against wood. “Lan would never turn his back on any"

You owe it to him.” Anden drew in\na hard breath and let it out again. He straightened. “If you\ndisown Niko, then I’m gone too. I’ll leave, Hilo.”\nHilo stared at him as if he were holding a match over\nkerosene. “You wouldn’t.”\n“Am I lying to you?” The Pillar could Perceive Anden’s\nresolve, would know if he was bluffing. Hilo did not say\nanything.\n“From the minute Lan brought me into this house, all I\never wanted was to be a Kaul,” Anden said roughly. “I hated\nmy Espenian blood on one side, and I was afraid of being the\nMad Witch’s boy on the other. But I’ve learned something\nover the years. I don’t have to be a Kaul if I don’t want to be.\nYou and Shae will always be Kauls. Niko, Ru, and Jaya—they\ndon’t have a choice either.

I’m the one overseeing the clan’s stake in\nhealthcare, training Green Bone doctors and certifying clinics.\nIf I leave, you’ll lose all of that.

In two weeks, I’m giving him a ride to the airport.”\nCHAPTER\n36\nA Fresh Start\nJ\non Remi took all of his meals at one of three Kekonese\nrestaurants in downtown Resville. His favorite was the Feast\nof Janloon, not because it had the best food (Kekon Delight,\ntwo blocks away, was better), but because it was the most\nsecure. The restaurant took up two floors of a narrow building.\nRemi always ate at a reserved table near the back of the\nsecond floor. Before he arrived, he sent two of his men ahead\nto make sure no threat was lying in wait for him. Bodyguards\nkept watch while he ate facing the stairwell, which was the\nonly way up to the second floor.

Every Crew Boss in the\ncountry was offended that a Kekonese had risen so\nmeteorically in Resville’s underworld and now controlled so\nmuch of that lucrative city. A number of them had already\nmade attempts to eliminate Remi and retake the parts of the\ngambling and prostitution businesses that they saw as\nbelonging rightfully to them. One of Remi’s cars had been\nruined by a drive-by shooting, and recently two men had\ngotten close enough to try to murder him at his favorite\nnightclub, the Blue Olive. He was alive only because years\nago, he’d been trained by Green Bones straight from Janloon.\nThe two crewboys who’d taken a run at him were delivered\nback to their Boss in body bags.\nIn addition to the Crews, there were the drug lords from\nTomascio to think of—vicious wesp bastards. Remi also had\nto consider that he’d angered many of his fellow Green Bones\nin Port Massy. They might come after him themselves, though\nmore likely the sanctimonious hypocrites were busy covering\ntheir own asses and ratting him out to the police at every turn.\nSo when rumor reached Jon Remi that a man new to town\nhad been frequenting the local fighting dens and unsubtly\nasking questions about the Bad Keck, his first suspicion was\nthat the nosy stranger was a police informant. When he had his\nown people investigate, his suspicions changed and deepened.\nThen, he became extremely curious.\n“Pick this guy up,” he ordered. “I want to meet him.”\nTonight, the only people on the second floor of the Feast of\nJanloon were three of Remi’s trusted men—Snakeheads who’d\nall been awarded jade for killing crewboys. One of them\npeered between the slats of the window blinds at the sound of\nan arriving vehicle and slamming car doors on the street\nbelow. “They’re here, boss.”\nRemi got a good look at the stranger as he was led up the\nstairwell and across the restaurant floor to Remi’s table. The\nman took off his cap as he approached. He wore plain brown\npants and an untucked black shirt under a faded corduroy\njacket. Remi had assumed the man would be in his late forties,\nbut he looked older than that, his face hard and lined, his dark\nhair flecked with gray and receding at the temples. He walked\nwith a certain cautious, unhurried care, but the alertness of his\nmanner, the arrogant predatory quality with which he held\nhimself, indicated that this was a man the Kekonese would call\ngreen in the soul.\n“Remi-jen,” said Maik Tar warily. He touched his forehead\nand dipped into a shallow salute.\nJon Remi gestured for the older man to sit down at the\ntable. Maik did so, helping himself to a glass of water and\nleaning back in the chair. He was not at ease—he did not seem"

He was not at ease—he did not seem\nto be the sort of person ever fully at ease—but he displayed no\nanxiety to be sitting in front of one of the city’s most notorious\ncrime bosses. Remi studied the man with interest. He gestured\nto the server. “What’ll you drink?”\n“Just water,” said Maik, speaking in Kekonese.\n“Not even hoji?” said Remi. “This place imports the\nquality stuff from Kekon, none of the cheap shit.”\n“I don’t drink,” Maik said. “Not anymore.”\nRemi shrugged and ordered another beer for himself. The\nother three Snakeheads at the table squinted at Maik in\nfascinated disappointment, as if he were a fictional character\ncome to life. “Tell me,” Remi said, “what brings a man who\nused to be a top Green Bone of the No Peak clan here to\nResville?”\nMaik scowled and shifted in his chair. “If you brought me\nhere to talk about the No Peak clan, you have the wrong\nperson,” he said bitterly. “I haven’t been a Green Bone for\ntwelve years. I haven’t touched jade, I haven’t been back to\nJanloon, I haven’t seen my family, not once. I’m no one in\nKekon.”\nThe man’s words were thick with so much sour resignation\nthat Remi didn’t doubt they were true. Besides, he’d already\ndug into Maik’s past. Remi’s connections in Port Massy had\ncorroborated the stories: Maik Tar used to be one of the most\nfeared Green Bones on either side of the Amaric Ocean. He’d\nbeen Kaul Hiloshudon’s right hand. He’d put the notorious\nWillum “Skinny” Reams at the bottom of Whitting Bay in\npieces. Then, a dozen years ago, he’d killed his own fiancée in\na blind rage and been exiled from the No Peak clan. Every one\nof Remi’s investigations confirmed that Maik had no contact\nwith Janloon. No visits back to the island, no phone calls, no\nmoney sent to him. Maik Tar, people told him, was jadeless\nand washed up, but not to be fucked with.\n“And yet, after all these years, people still know who you\nare,” Remi said, tapping his teeth thoughtfully with the end of\na toothpick. “That’s one hell of a reputation, old man. So I\ndon’t think it should be any surprise that I’d like to know why\nyou’ve shown up in my city.”\nMaik’s shoulders came down and he blew out a noisy\nbreath. “Port Massy is a big place, big enough even for\nsomeone like me to disappear into. But it’s getting too\nexpensive to live there. And too many people have ties to No\nPeak and know who I used to be. I can’t ever quite escape it.\nSo it’s time for a change. A fresh start. Resville is warmer, and\nthere are Kekonese people here.”\nMaik tilted his head curiously and gave Remi a straight\nstare, something that few men dared to do. “Also, I’d heard of"

And I couldn’t\nhelp wondering if he might have work for someone like me.”\nRemi raised his eyebrows, pleased that his own reputation\nhad reached the ears of a man like Maik Tar. “I’ve always got\nwork that needs to be done,” he said nonchalantly. “But why\nwould I trust someone who used to work for the Kauls?”\n“You used to work for the Kauls yourself,” Maik pointed\nout. “More recently than me. And now you’re your own man.”\nThe former Green Bone turned his head, looking around the\nroom at the Snakeheads, but Remi saw that his gaze didn’t\nlinger on expensive suits or shoes, or even weapons. He was\nlooking for the glint of green on fingers and wrists. Maik\nreturned his attention to Remi. “I’ve heard you give jade to\nthose who do a good job for you,” he said slowly. “That’s\nsomething the Kauls will never give back to me.”\nRemi wasn’t highly trained in Perception but he could still\ntell that Maik wasn’t lying. “How do I know you weren’t sent\nhere by the people in Port Massy?”\nMaik blinked, then smirked. “Those pussies? You’ve got to\nbe joking.” Two of Remi’s men couldn’t help laughing. Maik\nshook his head. “There used to be thick blood there, back\nwhen Rohn Toro and old Dauk were alive, but that was a long\ntime ago.”\nAs soon as Remi had heard that Maik Tar was in town and\nasking after him, he’d known he would either have to kill the\nman or bring him onto his side. Now he admitted to himself\nthat having a man of Maik Tar’s caliber and aptitude in\nviolence in his employ could be useful indeed. Remi was in\nneed of capable management at the street level. Two of his\nbest lieutenants had been arrested in the past three months, and\nhe was secretly worried about the Crews taking advantage of\nthis weakness.\nThe Bad Keck wore jade but he was Espenian-born. No\nmatter what sort of reputation he garnered in Resville, it could\nnot compare to the notoriety and mystique associated with the\nKekonese Green Bone clans. Keko-Espenians, no matter how\nthey felt about the old country, all understood that the best jade\nwarriors came from the island, that they grew up with jade and\nbegan wearing it as children, were trained at grueling martial\nacademies, and wore it openly in a culture that revered\ngreenness. There was simply no way to compete with those\nadvantages. Maik Tar could be an unparalleled asset.\nStill, Remi had his doubts. “You haven’t been a Fist in a\nlong time.”\nA shadow of ferocity crossed Maik’s face. “I used to be the\nPillarman of Kaul Hiloshudon,” he said with a note of\nundiminished pride. “He trusted me with the clan’s toughest\njobs, where blood had to be spilled, carefully and at the right"

I was good at what I did, and it\nwasn’t just because I was young and green. I had the right sort\nof mind for it.” Regret settled over the man’s face like a mask.\n“I made one mistake, a terrible mistake, and now I can never\ngo home. I want to do work I’m good at again, that’s all. But if\nyou’ve got too many doubts about me, that’s fine, I can\nunderstand that.” Maik put on his cap and began to stand.\n“Hold on, now,” Remi said. He chewed the end of the\ntoothpick as he motioned to one of the Snakeheads to bring his\nbriefcase. “A lot of men make themselves out to be bigger\nthan they really are. Now that I’ve met you for myself, I’ve\ngot to say—you don’t seem like one of those types.” Remi\nopened his briefcase and took out a handgun, a roll of cash,\nand a set of car keys. He placed them on the table in front of\nhim. “You want work, you’ve got it. The gun, the money, and\nthe car behind the restaurant are yours. Call it a signing bonus.\nFrom now on, you work for me. Talk to Teto after this; he’ll\nget you started.”\nMaik gave a small, impassive nod of agreement, as if Remi\nhad bought him a meal instead of handing him a new life as\nthe newest member of the Resville Snakehead gang.\n“Any questions?” Remi asked.\nMaik picked up the cash and pocketed it without counting\nthe amount. Perhaps doing so went against his Kekonese\nsensibilities. He took the gun and the keys, slipped them into\nhis jacket, and stood. “Just tell me what you want me to do.”\nCHAPTER\n37\nLeaving Home\nthe twentieth year, third month\nW\nhen the boarding announcement for his flight came over\nthe terminal speaker, Niko thought, It’s not too late. He could\nstill walk out of the airport and go home, admit he’d made a\nmistake and ask for his uncle’s forgiveness and his place back\nin the clan. He’d summoned all his angry determination and\nrighteous defiance to face down his parents with his decision.\nNow, however, an unsettled feeling was rolling around in his\nstomach, and he was more afraid than excited.\nHe took out his passport and boarding pass. “I guess this is\nit,” he said.\nHis uncle Anden walked him to the gate. Neither of them\nspoke. Anden was the one member of the family with whom\nNiko could always be comfortably silent. Often throughout his\nchildhood, when his mother had been struggling through her\nlong recovery from brain injury, Niko and his siblings had\nbeen cared for by their aunts and uncles. Anden was Niko’s\nfavorite relative. Uncle Anden would let him read for hours,\ntake him to the park to feed the ducks, or rent movies they\nwould watch together. He asked only a few questions and\nlistened to the answers without lecturing. Unlike other adults,"

Unlike other adults,\nhe didn’t ferry Niko around on a schedule, or begin\nconversations with, “When you grow up and get your jade …”\nNo one else in the clan was like Uncle Anden, so he didn’t\nexpect anyone else to be like him.\nAs they embraced at the gate, Anden said, “Promise me\nyou’ll be careful. You’re not leaving Kekon as a student, the\nway I did. You’ll be wearing jade into dangerous situations, far\nfrom home.”\nThe look of worry on Anden’s face made Niko feel more\nguilty than any amount of shouting or blistering disapproval\nfrom his parents. “I promise, Uncle,” Niko said. “Thanks for\nletting me stay at your place. I hope it wasn’t too much trouble\nfor you and Jirhuya.”\n“Of course it wasn’t,” Anden said, but he was looking\naround, scanning the passing travelers hopefully. He rubbed\nhis bare wrist, as if wishing for his jade and sense of\nPerception. Niko knew that Anden had gone to the house and\nargued with the Pillar. Anden hadn’t said anything about it, but\nRu had. Ru had come over to the apartment and said a lot of\nthings last night, spilling his feelings out like marbles as he\nbegged Niko to change his mind.\n“But why, Niko? Why would you throw away your position\nlike that?” Ru had been distraught with bewilderment. “I know\nthe pressure must be a lot to handle right now, but everyone in\nthe clan is rooting for you to become Pillar.” As usual, his\nbrother exaggerated, certain that what was indisputable to him\nmust be the truth.\nNiko had turned away from the pleading expression. “I’ve\nnever been in charge of my own life, Ru. Da tells you to study\nwhat you want in college, to become whatever you want to be.\nHe’s never once said that to me. What makes anyone think I\neven want to be Pillar?”\nRu grabbed him by the shoulders, turning him back\naround. When stirred by strong belief, he was easily the more\nrighteously angry one. “If I hadn’t been born a stone-eye, I’d\ndo my best to become the Pillar, no matter how hard it was or\neven if I thought I might like to do something else.” His eyes\nbored insistently into Niko’s. “Think of the difference you\ncould make, of all the good you could do for so many people.\nThe clan affects the lives of millions. It needs a Pillar who’s\nstrong and smart. How can you just … run away from that\nkind of responsibility?”\nNiko stepped back, pulling roughly out of his brother’s\ngrasp. “I’m not running away.”\n“Then come back home with me right now,” Ru\nexclaimed. “We’ll talk to Da together. I’ll back you up. So will\nJaya, and you know how good she is at getting her way. We’ll\nconvince Da to let you go to college part-time while you work\ntoward becoming a Fist.

We can go to Jan Royal together, like we planned.”\nWhen Niko gazed at him, unmoved, Ru went from cajoling\nto accusing. “How could you not even tell me what you were\nthinking? What happened to brothers sticking together?”\nNiko shook his head sadly. “We’re not kids anymore, Ru.”\nThe disappointment and naked hurt that had swept over his\nbrother’s face had curdled Niko with shame, but he wouldn’t\nlet it show. Ru was the only one who could’ve changed his\nmind, who could’ve broken his resolve. So he’d had to harden\nhis heart.\nNiko picked up his suitcase. He hadn’t packed much.\nWhere he was going, he didn’t expect he’d have much room\nfor personal belongings anyway. Two weeks of orientation at\nGSI headquarters in a town called Fort Jonsrock in\nnortheastern Espenia would be followed by three months at\none of the company’s training compounds. After that, he\nwould be on a two-year work contract and could be sent\nanywhere in the world.\nAnden stopped his fruitless glancing around and turned\nback to Niko with apology in his eyes. “I tried, Niko.” His\nshoulders sagged under the weight of resignation. “I—”\nThe unmistakable smooth warmth of the Pillar’s jade aura\nmaterialized in Niko’s Perception two seconds before Hilo\nwalked up behind them, his hands in the pockets of his jacket.\nThe expression on his face was unreadable, although his eyes\nwere tired.\n“Andy,” he said, “let me talk to my son alone.”\nAnden looked between the Pillar and Niko. Wordlessly, he\nput a hand on his nephew’s shoulder and gave it a supportive\nsqueeze. Then he touched his forehead to the Pillar in\nexpressionless acknowledgment and walked away, back\nthrough the airport terminal.\n“Take a walk with me,” Hilo said.\n“I’m about to get on a plane.”\n“It’ll only take a minute,” his uncle said, with such\nfamiliar parental authority that Niko obeyed. They walked\nfarther down the terminal. Niko wanted to act rude and angry.\nThe Pillar knew he’d been staying at Anden’s place. If he’d\nwanted to talk, he could’ve shown up at any time earlier,\ninstead of at the last minute, with the flight about to depart.\nBut he’d shown up, in the end.\n“Does Ma know you’re here?” Niko asked.\n“Yes,” Hilo said.\nSo his mother was still furious at him. Otherwise, she\nwould be here as well. Everyone knew the vengeful reputation\nof Kaul Hilo, but Niko understood that his mother was the one\nwho was less forgiving, who could carry a longer grudge.\n“You’re not going to change my mind,” Niko declared.\n“It’s too late for that.”\n“It’s too late for a lot of things.” Hilo stopped and turned to"

He handed Niko an envelope. “I’ve given\nyou back access to your bank accounts. There’s a calling card\nin the envelope, and a list of phone numbers—the Weather\nMan’s branch offices in every country where we have them,\nand contact numbers for Green Bones overseas who are part of\nthe clan or are our allies, who’ll help you if you need help.\nOnly if you really need it. Otherwise, you’re on your own.”\nSeveral conflicting impulses came into Niko’s mind but he\ncouldn’t form any of them in words. He wanted to disdainfully\nreject his uncle’s gesture and hang on to the emotional\nadvantage, but that seemed a childish thing to do. He wanted\nto relent, to say something that would make things right\nbetween them before he left, but that felt like admitting defeat.\nNiko had never been good at responding to his feelings in the\nmoment, so he said nothing.\nThe final boarding call was announced. He put the\nenvelope in his inside jacket pocket. “I’d better go,” he\nmumbled.\nHilo cupped a hand roughly around the back of Niko’s\nhead, pulling his nephew close, and spoke in a low declaration.\n“I would cut Jim Sunto’s throat and burn his company to the\nground if I thought that would stop you.” His grip tightened\nfiercely on the back of Niko’s neck. “But I know it’s not about\nthat. I love you enough to see that you have the right to hate\nme. Just remember, I only ever made the decisions I thought\nwere best for you.”\nHis uncle let go. His jade aura receded as he walked away\nthrough the streams of people.\n_______\nHilo stepped out of the airport and got into the passenger seat\nof Lott’s Lumezza FT Scorpion as it pulled up to the curb.\nThey drove to an airport hotel and went up to a guest suite on\nthe fifth floor. Vin Solu, the new First Fist of Janloon, was in\nthe room along with Hejo, the First Fist of White Rats, and\none of Hejo’s tech experts. Three young men were seated\naround a table covered with small gadgets, listening as Hejo\nand his technician explained each of the items. At Hilo and\nLott’s entrance, the men stood hastily and saluted the Pillar.\n“Kaul-jen,” they murmured in unison.\nHilo looked them over. Two of the young men were\nGolden Spiders from the Kekonese army: a man named Dasho\nwhom Hilo did not know, and Teije Inno, a remote cousin of\nthe Kaul family. The third young man was a junior Finger\nnamed Sim. All of them had been quickly but carefully chosen\nby the Horn. They each wore a little jade, five pieces at the\nmost, and fit the profile of lower-ranked Green Bones looking\nto better their fortunes. Each had applied separately and been\noffered employment by GSI. Packed suitcases and bags sat on\nthe floor near their feet.\n“Niko’s on his flight,” Hilo said. “You’ll all be leaving on\ndifferent ones over the next day.”\nLott withdrew an envelope from his pocket and handed out"

Those had been\nthe most expensive and difficult to create, but were also the\nmost likely to go undetected. GSI recruits could bring their\nown personal jade and wear it as they liked, and no one would\ndare to touch or closely examine another man’s jade.\n“You’ve learned how to use all this stuff?” Hilo asked.\nHejo’s tech expert, one of three that specialized in\noutfitting the clan’s White Rats, said, “They’re all pretty\nstraightforward. They can be easily discarded if necessary, and\nexcept for the jade, none of it can be traced back to No Peak.\nOnce you get to any new location, use the credit cards we gave\nyou at any bank or ATM, or call one of the contact numbers.\nWe’ll know immediately where you are.

You’re\ninfiltrating an Espenian company, not the Mountain clan. If\nyou get caught, they won’t kill you. They probably won’t even\ncripple you or beat you badly. They’ll only fire you and sue\nyou, and that’s no problem, we can handle that. You’ll be fine\nso long as you don’t act suspicious or tell any outright lies.\nSunto’s Perception isn’t anything like Vin’s.”\nSim asked uneasily, “Won’t he be worried about White\nRats?”\nThe Pillar made a face. “Sunto’s convinced that Green\nBones are eager to flee the clans to join his company. After the\ntalk we had in his office on Euman Island, he expects me to\nwhisper his name and for any attack from No Peak to come\nfrom head-on. After you’re gone, you’ll all be officially\ncondemned by the clan as shameful traitors. Remember that\nyour families will know the truth. Send us whatever\ninformation you can, but the main thing is that you watch\nNiko.” His nephew was a godsdamned fool, but there was no\nway under Heaven that Hilo was going to lose him in some\nstupid foreign war. “So long as my son is alive and well, and\nyou’re sending us whatever information you can, the money\nwill keep going to your families.” More money than GSI was\npaying, and more importantly, things that GSI could not\nprovide: loan forgiveness for Dasho’s parents, college for\nTeije’s sister, an expedited heart transplant for Sim’s niece.\nLott said, “Do you all understand what’s being asked of\nyou? If so, kneel and pledge your word to the Pillar.”"

Nearly six years had passed since the\nEspenians had yanked him out of the city overnight. Six years!\nTime that seemed to have magically disappeared. Galo and\nBerglund had arranged for him to be relocated, not to the\nROE, but to Iwansa, an Espenian territory at the southern end\nof the Uwiwan archipelago. Bero hadn’t even known that the\nEspenians owned a tiny island in the Uwiwas, an unpleasantly\ndry and mind-deadening place catering to Espenian tourists.\nThe Espenians had given him a new identity and a one-\nroom apartment. Bero hadn’t been stupid and blown all the\ncrisp Espenian thalirs he’d made from his years as an\ninformant by living lavishly and drawing attention to himself\nin Janloon, so he had enough money to last a long time in the\nUwiwas, where everything was cheap.\nThe main problem was that he hated Iwansa. No one spoke\nKekonese. Bero didn’t know any Uwiwan so he had to get by\nwith the bits of Espenian he picked up. The local food was all\nbland mush wrapped in palm leaves, shit like that. He made\nsome money by hanging around the place where the cruise\nships docked and finding Kekonese or Espenian tourists who\nwould pay him to drive them around.\nThere was nothing to do. All he wanted was to go back to\nKekon, but the final thing his Espenian military handlers had\ndone was warn him against doing so. He couldn’t shake the\nunsettling memory of the black-clad ROE operatives taking\ndown Molovni and carrying him out of the apartment with a\nhood over his head. A year after the Janloon bombing, Bero\nheard the news about an Ygutanian defector named Agent M\nwho gave up all the secrets of the nekolva program to the ROE\nmilitary. It had to be Molovni, but the Vastik eya Molovni that\nBero knew had tried to put a bullet in his own head rather than\nbe captured. Bero could only imagine what the Espenians had\ndone to the man to turn him into their meek tool. What might\nthey do to Bero if they thought he was going to run?\nEventually, however, they stopped paying attention to him.\nBero stopped receiving the occasional discomfiting phone\ncalls from ROE government representatives checking up on\nhim. Perhaps with the Slow War moving in some other\ndirection, what Bero did or didn’t know was no longer of any\ninterest or concern. Or Galo and Berglund simply forgot about\nhim. Bero still despised Iwansa but he had to admit he’d\nbecome accustomed to it. What danger would he be putting\nhimself in if he went back to Kekon?"

What danger would he be putting\nhimself in if he went back to Kekon?\nYou’re such a fucking pussy now.\nThe instant he was back in Janloon, however, Bero felt\nbetter, as if he’d been slowly turning on a cooking spit for\nyears and finally been plunged into a cool tub of salve. On his\nfirst day back, he sat on a park bench in Paw-Paw soaking the\ncity back into his pores—the grease of street food, the sounds\nof hawkers and cab drivers shouting in Kekonese, the spring\ndamp on his parched skin. Even garbage in Janloon smelled\nbetter than it did elsewhere, the rats were sleeker.\nMost of the people Bero had known were gone. Out of\ncuriosity, he went back to the Little Persimmon lounge and to\nhis great surprise he found Tadino working behind the bar. The\nman looked different—his hair was longer and he’d lost his\nsneering, sharptongued bravado. Instead, a hunted look darted\nin his eyes, and a raised red circular scar on his left cheek\ndistorted the skin of his face.\n“Shit, keke, is that you?” Tadino exclaimed. “Where have\nyou been?”\n“Nowhere,” Bero said. “Staying the fuck away from\neveryone.”\n“Left town? Smart move. I thought maybe they picked you\nup in the raids along with everyone else.” Tadino dried his\nhands on a towel and glanced around nervously before leaning\nin to speak in a lowered voice. “They had our names on a\nfucking list, keke. Did you know Molovni disappeared? He\nmust’ve ratted all of us out. Good thing you got away.”\n“What happened to your face?” Bero asked.\nTadino winced, involuntarily touching his scarred cheek.\n“You really have been gone, haven’t you? The Mountain clan\ncame in here, saying this was a meeting place for the clanless.\nI got off easy because they thought I was just the bartender.”\nBero said, “It doesn’t look that bad.”\n“It hurt so fucking much I pissed myself.” Tadino\nshuddered at the memory and ran an agitated hand through his\ndisheveled hair. He gave Bero a strangely desperate look. “I’ve\ngot to say, I’m glad to see you, keke. There aren’t many of us\nleft, you know? Why’d you come back here, anyway?”\n“I need work.”\nIt was true. He’d used up all his Espenian cash and needed\nto make money again. The obvious thing to do would be to go\nback to stealing or drug dealing, but after talking with Tadino,\nhe was forced to conclude that was too risky. The clans had\nalways tolerated some low level of street crime, but these\ndays, anyone caught engaging in anti-clan activities—stealing\nfrom or damaging clan businesses, shine dealing, jade\ntrafficking, associating with the Clanless Future Movement or\npolitically radical causes, or simply having too many\nsuspicious foreign connections—would get anything from a\nface branding up to a gravesite, depending on the severity of\nthe offense.

Bero had at different times in his life been guilty\nof every single one of those things, and now that he was\nfinally back in Janloon, the last thing he wanted was for Green\nBones to notice him.\nBero had few legally employable skills, but he could drive\nand knew the streets well, so he got a job as a package\ndelivery man. The money was shit, though, so after six\nmonths, he cooked up a plan with two of Tadino’s friends and\nbegan using the delivery company’s van to move bootlegged\nvideo and music tapes to booth vendors who sold them to\ntourists in the Docks and in the Temple and Monument\nDistricts. As long as they were ripping off foreigners, he\nfigured he was safe, although the money was only so-so.\nNothing close to what he’d once made as a jade-wearing\nrockfish or a shine dealer or an informer. Bero decided he\ncould accept that. Less money, but less danger. So be it. He\nwas thirty-six now, fucking old.\n“We’ve got to do something,” Tadino began saying every\ntime Bero showed up at the Little Persimmon to drink. The\nman’s scarred face didn’t seem to repel customers. If anything,\nthe sort of people who visited the Little Persimmon seemed to\ntreat it as a badge of honor, or a mark of credibility, like a\nprison tattoo. “We’ve got to save the Clanless Future\nMovement before it’s too late. Otherwise the clans win.”\n“The clans always win,” Bero mumbled scornfully.\n“Guriho and Otonyo blew up a building with all the Green\nBone leaders in it and where are they now? Feeding worms.”\n“ ’Cause they got it all wrong,” Tadino insisted. “I’m\ntelling you, I’ve thought about this a lot. Trying to take out the\nclans like that was stupid. All it did was unite them in crushing\nus under their heels. Now they’re hunting us down like dogs.”\nTadino wiped down the bar counter with violent swipes of the\ncloth, putting all his hatred into the polished wood. “And what\nhappened to all those foreign ‘friends’ that bastard Molovni\npromised us would support the cause? Where are the fuckers\nnow? Left us to be slaughtered, that’s what. We’ve got to save\nourselves, ’cause no one else will.”\nBero couldn’t argue with that, so he said nothing, which\nonly encouraged Tadino. The man leaned an elbow on the bar\nand jutted his angular face near Bero’s. “Don’t tell me you’re\ndone, keke. You’re not just going to sit there like a lump and\ndrink, are you? You and me, we’re still cut. You still want to\nstick it to the clans as much as I do.”\nBero scowled into his hoji. Just because he still hated\nGreen Bones didn’t mean he was going to risk his neck for the\nsorry remnants of the Clanless Future Movement. Without\nMolovni bringing in money and weapons from Ygutan, what\ncould they do? Better to move on, forget all that old shit."

You really have turned into a fucking pussy.\nBero downed the rest of his drink with a surge of self-\nloathing. He’d become soft and useless while away in Iwansa.\nHe used to be full of thick blood and daring. He’d done things\nno one else could’ve done. Tadino might be talking bitter\nnonsense, but at least he was still thinking, still trying to do\nwhat Bero used to do for himself—come up with the plan that\ncould change everything. Maybe the ratfaced bastard was\nright. Maybe there was still more for Bero to do.\nHe squinted with guarded interest for the first time. “What\ndo you have in mind?”\n“Here’s the thing.” Tadino licked his lips. “The only way\nto take down a Green Bone clan is with another Green Bone\nclan.”\n“What’re you getting at?”\n“When are times best for people like us?” Tadino answered\nhis own question with a glint in his eye. “When there’s war,\nkeke. The way to bring down the clans is to make them go to\nwar with each other again.”\nCHAPTER\n39\nThe Stone-Eye Club\nO\nn his first day of classes at Jan Royal University, Kaul\nRulinshin stood in the main campus plaza, awash in nervous\nexcitement as he watched students strolling across the grounds\nbetween the wide lawns and brick buildings. Ru didn’t think of\nhimself as a particularly academic person, but having grown\nup in a ruling clan family where nearly everyone was a jade\nwarrior or a businessman, the sheer wealth of possibilities in\ncollege made him giddy.\nOne dense cloud of sadness marred the clear blue sky of\nhis mood. Niko should be here. Niko had always been the\nsmart one, the one who liked reading and was good at school,\nwho would surprise adults with the sorts of things he’d learned\nand remembered. Now, Ru had no idea where his brother was.\nHe’d received one letter from Niko, saying that he’d finished\ntwo weeks of orientation at GSI headquarters in Fort Jonsrock,\nEspenia. Ru had to look up the place in an encyclopedia to\nfind out where it was. Niko didn’t say where he was going\nnow, nor did he mention the painful conversation they’d had\nbefore he’d left. In the letter, he didn’t even say whether he\nliked the job so far, whether he was happy. There’d been no\nreturn address on the envelope, no way for Ru to write back.\nRu shouldered his backpack and went to his first class,\nGovernment and Society 120. It was an entry-level\nundergraduate course, held in a large lecture hall with hard\nseats and weak lighting. No one recognized him in that class\nor the other two he attended that day, which was not\nsurprising. His father saw to it that the media kept away from\nhim, and compared to his siblings, he’d always gone unnoticed\nwithin the clan.\nWhen he checked out books from the library the next day,\nhowever, the librarian who took his student ID card looked at\nhim curiously, then glanced down at his name. “Oh!

Kaul\nRulinshin? You’re the Pillar’s son, the—” She did not finish\nthe sentence with stone-eye. Flushing with embarrassment, she\ntouched her forehead in abbreviated salute. “My husband and\nhis parents are Lantern Men of No Peak. They own Wan’s\nChariot—the chain of autobody shops. All the clan’s top\nGreen Bones take their cars there. My husband’s worked on\nthe Horn’s Lumezza, the Weather Man’s Cabriola, and of\ncourse your father’s Duchesse.” She checked his books out\nwith vigor. “We were at the clan New Year’s party, the big one\nat the General Star Hotel last month. I suppose you must’ve\nbeen there? It was huge! I’m sure your father doesn’t\nremember us, since he spoke to so many people that night, but\nif you get a chance, will you let him know that the Wans from\nWan’s Chariot send their loyal respects?”\n“I’ll let him know when I’m home for dinner this\nFifthday,” Ru promised.\nThe librarian beamed. “I’m honored to have met you.\nCome back often. If you ever want to book one of the private\nstudy cubicles or the computer stations, just let me know. I’ll\nget you the best one. There’s a two-hour limit, but I can\noverride that.”\nRu thanked her. The next time he went to the library to\ncheck out books, he told Mrs. Wan that his father said he\nwouldn’t trust his Duchesse to any other autobody shop, which\ndelighted her so much she gave him a staff code that he could\nuse on any of the photocopy machines in the library without\npaying for copies. Ru had a few other encounters with clan\nmembers or associates on campus. The teaching assistant of\nhis economics class was the younger brother of a high-rank\nFist. One of his classmates in Kekonese Literature 300 was the\ndaughter of a No Peak loyalist in the Royal Council.\nOccasionally, he was recognized on campus by strangers who\nstopped him to convey their regards to his family.\nThis sort of attention would’ve irritated Niko. He would’ve\nstarted power walking from place to place to avoid being\napproached by people. Ru didn’t mind. He always smiled and\nreplied in a friendly way. With Niko gone, he had to start\nthinking of himself as the first son of the family. Even though\nhe couldn’t be a leader in the clan, that didn’t mean he\ncouldn’t make a difference. After all, his mother was a stone-\neye, too, but she helped his father to be the Pillar. Ru thought\nhe could’ve been of help to Niko, if only Niko would believe\nin himself first.\nHe’ll come back, Ru told himself. He has to. It had been\nheartbreaking to see his brother not only condemned by their\nfather, but excoriated by the press, held up as evidence of the\ndeclining morals of a younger generation that was less green\nand no longer respected aisho.

Those self-appointed pundits\ndidn’t know anything about Niko, and their unflattering\ncharacterization certainly didn’t apply to Jaya, or Cam, or the\nJuen twins. It angered Ru to hear people say ignorant and\nnegative things based on shallow impressions or hearsay. So\nhe felt a responsibility to represent his family and No Peak as\nwell as possible. Besides, he liked to meet people and to learn\nof all the different ways his clan affected the lives of ordinary\nKekonese.\nNevertheless, Ru felt lonely on the large campus of Jan\nRoyal University. His family’s status had always set him apart\nfrom his peers at school and added a layer of difficulty when it\ncame to making and keeping friends. Classmates assumed he\nwouldn’t want to stand in line with them for hours to watch\nthe new Danny Sinjo movie, when his parents could take him\nto the premiere. They hesitated to invite him to a pool party in\nMountain-controlled Summer Park, knowing he would have to\ncome with bodyguards. He was thankful to have had his high\nschool relayball team, and his best friends, Tian and Shin, who\ntreated him no differently than anyone else. But Tian had gone\nto the Lukang Institute of Technology for college and Shin had\njoined the Kekonese military. Ru didn’t even have Koko to\nkeep him company, as pets were not allowed in student\nhousing.\nRu perused the student center cafeteria’s bulletin board\nwith notices advertising different campus clubs and decided to\ntake a chance. On a Fourthday afternoon six weeks into his\nfirst semester, he made his way into a classroom in the\nbasement of the Social Sciences building to attend a student\nchapter meeting of the Charitable Society for Jade\nNonreactivity. He knew about the CSJN because his mother\nhad spoken at some of their events and been interviewed for a\nprofile in their magazine. Ru’s mouth was dry with nerves\nwhen he walked into the room. How would the club members\nreact to the son of a clan Pillar intruding on their meeting?\nAfter all, Ru’s family sat at the top of the cultural power\nstructure that revered jade abilities and stigmatized stone-eyes\nand the entire Abukei race.\nA few desks pushed together against the wall held an\nassortment of bottles of soda and a spread of snacks—the\nexpected bowls of nuts and crackers, date cakes, sesame and\nfruit candies, the usual junk. There were fourteen people in the\nroom—nine Kekonese stone-eyes and five Abukei students. A\nyoung Abukei woman greeted Ru cheerfully and directed him\nto write his name on a name tag. He did so with trepidation,\nthen grabbed a soda and sat down in one of the empty chairs\nthat had been arranged in a circle in the center of the\nclassroom.\nOne of the Kekonese students stood up and identified\nhimself as Dano, a third-year political science major and the\nleader of the student chapter of the CSJN. Even though it was\nthe middle of the afternoon, Dano looked as if he’d just woken\nup.

His spiky hair was sticking up in several directions, he\nhadn’t shaved, and he was wearing a rumpled T-shirt and jeans\nthat might’ve been fished out from the bottom of a laundry\nbasket. Nevertheless, he was bursting with enthusiasm.\n“Our club is about supporting each other,” he declared to\nthe small group. “I’ll bet every one of us in this room has been\nin a situation where we felt as if we were completely alone.\nThe only unlucky one, someone the gods didn’t care about.\nWell, that’s not true. You’re not alone. And the more we work\ntogether to educate people about nonreactivity and be open\nabout who we are, the less alone we’ll be.”\nDano went on to explain the meeting schedule, club\nevents, the affiliation with the national CSJN and the campus\npartnership with the Abukei Student Alliance, and volunteer\npositions that needed to be filled. “I see we have a few new\nmembers,” Dano said, “so let’s all introduce ourselves.” He sat\nback down in his chair.\nRu did not remember any of the other students’ names.\nWhen it came time for him to speak, his hands were clammy.\nHe wiped them on his jeans and said, “My name’s Kaul\nRulinshin. This is my first year at Jan Royal.” He cleared his\nthroat. “My family is … well, it’s full of Green Bones. I’ve\nspent my whole life surrounded by clan culture and jade, so …\nthis is all pretty new to me. I’m glad to have found this club,\nand I’m looking forward to getting to know everyone.”\nHe couldn’t read any of the expressions around him. If\nonly he had a sense of Perception, he would know whether to\nget up and leave. Of course, if he had a sense of Perception, he\nwouldn’t be here at all.\nDano began stamping his feet on the floor in applause. The\nrest of the club members followed his example, smiling in\nwelcome, and Ru’s shoulders came down in relief.\nDano said, “Welcome to the stone-eye club, keke. By the\nway, I’m opposed to everything your clan stands for.” He\ngrinned so wide his cheeks stretched, then reached over to clap\nRu on the shoulder. “We’re going to be great friends!”\n_______\nThey did become friends. Dano was a natural social connector\nwho seemed to know people from all walks of life and was\nalways going to or coming from a wild party. Spending a\nconsiderable number of his waking hours intoxicated or\nhungover did not appear to dent his energy. Besides being the\nleader of the campus CSJN chapter, he was involved in the\nIndependence League, a grassroots organization that\nadvocated for the election of non-clan-affiliated political\ncandidates, the Immigrant Rights Watch, which provided legal\nand economic assistance to refugees, and the Royal Creed, the\ncampus newspaper. At times Ru wondered if Dano even went\nto class.\nThey had spirited debates after every stone-eye club\nmeeting. Dano loved to argue almost as much as he loved to\ndrink. After Ru mentioned that he would likely work in the No\nPeak clan after he graduated, Dano said, “You’ll be devoting\nyour career to upholding the very system that stigmatizes"

Don’t you think that’s like a pig building its own\nroasting pit?”\nRu’s mouth fell open. He had never met anyone who\nwould dare to say something like that to him. “You can’t\nblame hundreds of years of superstition on my clan. My da has\nalways supported me and never put me down. He named my\nma as his Pillarman. Maybe my ma and me being stone-eyes\nin the clan is one reason prejudice against nonreactivity is\ngoing down.”\nThey left the Social Sciences basement and hurried across\ncampus, late for class but still arguing. “Even if your relatives\nare nice to you personally,” Dano conceded, “that doesn’t\nchange the fact that the clans exist to protect the interests of\nGreen Bones and keep them in power to the detriment of\neveryone else.”\n“Society isn’t a contest of Green Bones versus non–Green\nBones!” Ru retorted. “Every Green Bone has family members\nand friends who don’t wear jade, and the clans protect all of\nKekon. If you studied history”—a shameless dig, because\nDano was supposed to be on his way to history class—“you’d\nknow that if it weren’t for Green Bones, our country would be\na plundered postcolonial mess like the Uwiwas instead of a\nprosperous modern economy.”\nDano shrugged, clearly enjoying getting a rise out of his\nverbal sparring partner. “I admit the One Mountain Society\nplayed a big part in overthrowing the Shotarian occupation,\nbut that was almost fifty years ago. Other countries don’t need\nclans. They’re obsolete, parochial institutions.”\n“Must you talk out of your ass?” Ru almost shouted. “Of\ncourse, clannism isn’t perfect—no system is. That’s why\neveryone should work together on improving it, not throwing\nit out altogether like the foreigners and anarchists want us to.\nThink about international trade, military reform, even the\ngrowth of the entertainment industry—the Green Bone clans\nled those changes. My own relatives made them happen. You\ndon’t know a damn thing!” They reached the Foreign Studies\nbuilding where Ru’s next class was located. “So, see you later\non Fifthday?”\n“Yeah,” said Dano. “Bring cash; I hear there’re going to be\nstrippers.”\nRu wasn’t sure if he actually liked Dano or not. He could\nbe morally pompous, ignorant, and infuriating, but Ru had\nnever had anyone challenge his worldview so regularly.

The other girl had cried,\nwhich had mortified and embarrassed Ru beyond belief. He\nwould’ve ignored the mild taunting, and he certainly didn’t\nneed Jaya to stick up for him.\nIt was obvious from her expression now that she suspected\nRu wasn’t keeping good company. “I wonder if any of these\npeople you’re meeting in college are on Lott-jen’s watch lists.\nWhat did you say his name was again?”\n“Forget it,” Ru said quickly. “He just likes to say\nprovocative things; he’s not anyone to worry about.” Some of\nthe things Dano said could indeed be interpreted as radical\nanti-clan sentiment, which might raise suspicion of ties to the\nClanless Future Movement. Ru had been twelve years old at\nthe time of the Janloon bombing. He would never forget being\npulled out of school and waiting for over a day to find out if\nhis father was still alive. He hated the violent anarchists and\nunderstood better than anyone why there was little tolerance\nfor anti-clan attitudes.\nDano, however, was a college student like him, not a CFM\nterrorist. Ru was starting to think that the threat of clanless\nextremists unfortunately stifled worthwhile discussions about\nhow the clans could or should change in ways that benefited\nmore Kekonese, including those who could never wear jade or\nweren’t born into clan families. Dano didn’t have the insider’s\nview that Ru did. The Mountain and No Peak were vaguely\nmalevolent monolithic entities to him. He couldn’t understand\nthat Ru’s parents and his aunt Shae and his uncle Anden were\nreal people. Good people. People were what made the clan.\nRu disagreed with his friend on many things, but he didn’t\nwant anything bad to happen to him. He resolved to keep his\nmouth shut around Jaya from now on. His sister was a year-\neight at the Academy but sure to take oaths as a Finger when\nshe graduated. If Jaya thought Dano was a threat to society, or\nat the very least, a bad influence on her brother, who knew\nwhat she might do.\nCHAPTER\n40\nDifficult Daughters\nthe twenty-first year, first month\nK\naul Dushuron Academy had changed in notable ways since\nShae had been a student. New buildings and facilities were\ndedicated to classes in firearms, surveillance, and computer\nprogramming, among other subjects. There was now a\nseparate dormitory for adult foreign students, and additional\ntraining fields to accommodate trainees in the low-residency\nprogram, which had been instituted despite some concern from\nalumni that it could dilute the school’s brand and take away\nfocus from the core full-time curriculum.

        "text": "tradition of Pre-Trials.\nJaya’s year-eight Pre-Trials were held on a crisp but sunny\nlate autumn day, and the entire Kaul family turned out for the\nevent to support her. Even Anden and Jirhuya made an\nappearance, having jointly decided to endure their respective\ndiscomforts with attending. For Anden, any visit to the\nAcademy brought up the memory of his humiliating\ngraduation ceremony. Jirhuya might be one of the few Abukei\nto have ever set foot on Academy grounds.\nIn a rare show of fraternal support, Ru cheered loudly for\nhis sister, and Hilo glowed with pride when Jaya’s name shot\nto the top of the ranking list after the Deflection event. Her\nLightness scores in the afternoon brought her down to sixth,\nbut Hilo said he didn’t care if Jaya was First of Class; he only\nwanted her to be happy with her performance. “This is where\nall the Green Bones of our family went to school,” Hilo told\nTia, holding Shae’s daughter on his lap while Woon went to\nbuy them all sodas. “You’ll come here too when you’re older.”\nAt the Massacre of the Mice, Jaya stepped up to her\nposition, cricked her neck back and forth, and slapped hands\nwith the girl next to her. She stuck her tongue out at one of the\nboys at the end of the row and blew a kiss to one of the\nwatching year-sevens, which made Hilo’s eyes narrow with\nsuspicion. The mice in their cages scurried around in circles,\ntheir tiny claws scratching against the wire mesh. The bell\nsounded. Jaya snuffed out two mice in one corner at the same\ntime with her first blast of Channeling. She cursed out loud as\nshe missed the next one, stunning the mouse but not killing it,\nbut finished it off on the next try and killed the last two with\nsuccessive pops of energy, beating out the next fastest time—\nthe boy at the end of the row—by .85 of a second. The crowd\ncheered, Hilo loudest of all, and Jaya punched her fists into the\nair and danced around in victory.\nTia burst into sobs.\nShae and Woon tried to comfort her. “They’re only mice,”\nWoon said. “They have to die for people to practice\nChanneling.”\n“Why do people cheer when they die?” Tia wept.\n“We’re not cheering because they died, we’re cheering\nbecause Jaya won,” Shae explained.\n“She won by killing them! Does everyone in school have\nto kill mice? Did you kill them?” When they both admitted\nthey had, Tia cried harder.\nShae and Woon left Pre-Trials before the awards ceremony\nand stopped Tia’s tears by getting fried bread from a Hot Hut\ndrive-thru on the way home. While Woon settled their\ndaughter to bed later that evening, Shae went over to the main\nhouse. “She’s already six and a half,” Shae said worriedly to\nHilo. “Is it something I’ve done wrong?

        "text": "shielded or coddled her.”\nToday was not the first time Tia had been so easily upset.\nShe refused to watch cockfights. Even sparring matches on the\nlawn made her anxious. Of course, compassion was one of the\nDivine Virtues, but violence was also a part of life in a Green\nBone family. Where had Tia gotten such softness? “Maybe it’s\nbecause she doesn’t get enough of my time and attention.”\nShe and Hilo were alone in the living room and the rest of\nthe house was quiet. Ru had gone back to campus, Jaya was\nwith her classmates at a Pre-Trials after-party, and Wen, tired\nfrom the long day, had already gone up to bed. Jaya had come\nin third in the final rankings, a great showing.\nHilo pulled out two glasses and a bottle of hoji from the\ncabinet and poured them each a serving. He picked up his\nglass and held the other out to her, grinning. “Inside, I’m\ncrowing with laughter that my tough little sister is sitting here\nmoaning and asking me for parenting advice.”\n“I’m not moaning or asking you for advice,” Shae retorted\nreflexively before admitting to herself that perhaps she was.\nShe snatched the glass of hoji.\n“Shae,” Hilo said, turning serious, “if there’s one thing\nI’ve learned in life, it’s that you can’t make people turn out a\ncertain way no matter how much you try, including your kids.\nEspecially your kids.”\nShe knew he was thinking of Niko, wherever he was. Shae\ncouldn’t condemn her nephew for turning his back on the\nfamily and the clan, not when she’d done it herself in the past,\nbut now she understood, in a way she hadn’t before, what it\nwas like for those left behind to feel the weight of an empty\nchair at the table. She hoped Niko was doing what he wanted\nto do, finding whatever it was he wanted to find. All she could\ndo was pray to the gods to keep Lan’s son safe.\nHilo gazed morosely for a long moment into his glass of\nhoji, then swirled it and drank. “Not everyone is suited for this\nkind of life. And I don’t mean wearing jade. I mean all of it.”\nShae drew her feet up onto the sofa, tucking her legs under\nher. She sipped the hoji and leaned her head back against the\ncushions. “It’s not that I want my daughter to follow in my\nfootsteps.” She’d made many mistakes in her life, but when\nshe examined her own decisions, she couldn’t even say which\nones had been right or wrong. “But it hurt a little today, when\nTia looked at me with tears in her eyes. I could see her coming\nto the realization that maybe her mother isn’t such a good\nperson.”\nHilo’s jade aura expanded then contracted in her\nPerception, a deep mental sigh. “Only children and gods are\narrogant enough to judge what they can’t understand. There’s\nno point being afraid of their opinions. Don’t worry about Tia.\nShe’s only six and a half years old, like you said. Still too\nyoung for you to worry.”\nThey sat in silence for a few minutes. Outside, Shae could"

        "text": "She’s only six and a half years old, like you said. Still too\nyoung for you to worry.”\nThey sat in silence for a few minutes. Outside, Shae could\nhear workers painting the Horn’s house and expanding the\ngarage to suit its new occupant. The Juens had moved off the\nestate and were spending a year traveling the world. Shae was\nhappy for them. Not everyone at the highest level of the clan\nhad to be like her and Hilo. Not everyone had to be a Kaul.\nShae considered all the motivations that had fueled her\nefforts as Weather Man over the years—duty, vengeance,\nrivalry, personal pride and achievement, the hope and belief\nthat she could make No Peak into a stronger, better, more\nmodern clan than the one she’d grown up with and wanted as a\nyoung woman to put behind her. Greater than all those desires\nnow was the overwhelming bone-deep need to keep Tia safe,\nto secure for her sweet-tempered child a future where she\nwould not have to fight the way her mother had.\nShae said, “I want to set up a No Peak office in Shotar.”\nHilo said nothing at first, waiting for his Weather Man to\ncontinue. “Our growth in Espenia has slowed,” Shae\nexplained. “The real estate market there is contracting and the\neconomy’s going to be weak for a while. Years of ad\ncampaigns and political lobbying have paid off in some\nsignificant ways—we’ve prevented the Espenian government\nfrom criminalizing clan operations and we’ve gotten existing\npenalties on civilian ownership of jade reduced. But there’s\nstill no sign that jade will be fully legalized.”\nHilo drew a hand over his brow and exhaled in resignation.\nLess, Shae suspected, because of what she’d said than the\nrealization he was not going to be able to enjoy the rest of the\nevening without discussing clan matters.\nShae went on. “In Kekon, we took over the Jo Sun clan\nand have Toshon now, but the Mountain added the Black Tail\nclan so they have Gohei, plus they still have the upper hand in\nLukang. There’s no room for either of us to pull ahead. We\nneed other markets.”\n“Hami established an office in Tun,” Hilo pointed out.\n“You can speed up the growth there.”\n“We’ve been trying for years, but Tun is a difficult place to\ndo business. It’s politically unstable and on the brink of\ncurrency collapse. The infrastructure is poor, the language is\nhard to learn, the laws and financial markets are\nunderdeveloped.” She’d already spent countless hours\nconsidering all possible avenues. “Ygutan is obviously not an\noption for us. There’s still an active embargo on the Uwiwa\nIslands. That leaves Shotar.”\nHilo drummed his fingers on the arm of the sofa. “Hami\nthinks it’s a bad idea.”\nShae had over the years stopped being surprised when Hilo\nknew something about the business side of the clan that she\ndidn’t expect him to. He still couldn’t find his way through a\nfinancial report without her help, but he knew who he needed\nto know. He possessed a complete mental map of the clan’s\nLantern Men by wealth, influence, and loyalty. He knew who\namong Shae’s subordinates in the Weather Man’s office held"

He knew who\namong Shae’s subordinates in the Weather Man’s office held\nparticular expertise or ability, and he would speak directly\nwith them whenever it suited him. Of course, that was his\nprerogative as Pillar, but sometimes it irked her. It made her\nsuspect that even after all these years, he did not entirely trust\nher not to act behind his back.\nShe admitted with a frown, “Hami’s convinced the\nMountain has an unsurpassable advantage there because of Ayt\nMada’s alliance with the Matyos. Iyilo was one of the Matyos\nbefore he took Ti Pasuiga from Zapunyo, and most of the\nbarukan refugees who Ayt brought over from Oortoko were\nMatyos. They’re the largest of the barukan gangs. They\ncontrol powerful labor unions and have influence in several\nindustries.”\n“So going into Shotar would be as hard for us as it was for\nthe Mountain to break into Resville. Your Rainmaker’s\nreasoning seems solid to me,” Hilo said, but she could tell\nfrom the texture of his jade aura that he was still undecided.\n“The big difference is that we have a weapon in Shotar that\nthe Mountain didn’t have in Espenia, thanks to your chess\nmaster of a former Horn. Juen built a network of White Rats in\nthat country that we can use to pry ourselves an opening.”\nAfter she’d laid out her plan, Hilo finished the hoji in his\nglass. “I’ll give my permission to do this if Lott agrees to use\nhis White Rats in the way you suggest, and you can get Hami\nto come around to your thinking. This will work only if we can\nprotect our assets without sending over many Fists and\nFingers. Between Janloon, Lukang, and now Toshon, we’re\nalready stretched on the greener side of the clan, and the\nMountain still has the advantage of numbers over us.” The\ngrudge in Hilo’s voice was plain. Still. After all these years,\nthey were still locked into the same infuriating stalemate.\nEvery step that No Peak took, the Mountain took another.\n“They haven’t tried to come at us lately,” Shae pointed out.\nThe past six years had been spent in a state of necessary\ncollusion with their rivals, focusing on crushing the Clanless\nFuture Movement and consolidating power among the\nweakened minor clans and in secondary cities. Both clans\nwere also struggling with internal issues. Shae suspected that\nAyt Mada had her hands full holding together the extremes of\nher clan, from the traditionalist Kobens on one end to the\nbarukan elements on the other. In No Peak, Niko’s departure\nhad created a public scandal and thrown the question of\nsuccession wide open.\nThe only upside of all the turmoil was that the Mountain\nhadn’t recently tried to send anyone from the Kaul family to\nthe grave.\nHilo patted his empty pockets, clearly longing for a\ncigarette. “Ayt’s been quiet,” he agreed, turning thoughtful\neyes on Shae. “Maybe she has some human feeling in her after\nall.” She knew he was thinking that even Ayt Mada must feel"

At times now, it was\ntempting to forget that Ayt Mada’s ultimate goal of one clan\nover Kekon meant that Shae and Hilo could never rest. The\nimmovable fact remained that even without Ayt whispering\ntheir names, they could never stop thinking of the Mountain as\nan enemy against whom they were racing. As soon as No Peak\ndropped behind, once it slowed or grew weak, it would fall\nand be trampled.\nShae looked out the darkening window and sucked the\ninside of her cheek. “The Mountain isn’t sitting back. Iwe\nKalundo has been divesting assets and businesses in Ygutan.”\nHilo shrugged, unsurprised. “That country’s not good for\nthem anymore.” The Ygutanian economy had been hit hard by\nthe global downturn, the nekolva program had come under\nintense international scrutiny and sanction, and the Directorate\nin Dramsk was going through internal strife of its own.\nWidespread belief about Ygutanian support of the CFM prior\nto the Janloon bombing had vaulted them into being the most\nhated of foreigners, so Ayt Mada’s prior investments in that\ncountry were surely not sitting well with many in her clan.\n“Yes,” Shae mused, “but the Mountain wouldn’t retreat\nwithout a plan. As far as I can tell, they haven’t yet reinvested\nthe proceeds elsewhere. They’re moving chess pieces but I\ncan’t see the shape of it. If Ayt’s been quiet, it’s because she’s\nplanning something.”\nThe phone in the kitchen rang. Hilo got up to answer it.\nSeconds later, Shae Perceived the explosive flare of his jade\naura from all the way across the room. She bolted to her feet in\nalarm. Hilo was squeezing the phone receiver so hard she\nthought he might inadvertently crush it with his Strength.\n“What is it?” she hissed. “What’s happened?”\nHilo spoke into the phone through clenched teeth. “I’ll be\nthere in a few minutes.” He hung up and grabbed his jacket\nand car keys. “Jaya’s been arrested.”\n_______\nThe chief of police explained to Hilo that Jaya had been\ninvolved in a violent altercation at a house party and a young\nman was in the hospital in serious condition but would\nfortunately survive. The party had consisted primarily of Kaul\nDu Academy students, and all the families affected were from\nNo Peak, so it was clearly a clan matter. Jaya was released to\nher father, who drove her home, ordered her into the study, and\nshut the door.

She was wearing black jeans\nand a leather jacket over a bright red top that showed off her\nnavel. She propped her feet on the coffee table and looked up\nat her father with a shrug. “What do you want me to say? He\ndeserved what he got.”\n“Were you having sex with him?”\n“Da!” Jaya looked mortified at her father’s question. “Do\nyou really want to know that about your own daughter?”\nWhen Hilo’s glower didn’t change, she admitted, “We were\ndating for a little while, but I broke it off last month. He’s cute,\nbut he was getting clingy, and also he could be such a\npompous jerk. Anyway, I didn’t want him or his family getting\nany ideas.”\nHilo grimaced at her matter-of-fact assessment. With Niko\ngone, Jaya had become the focus of clan speculation. Since the\nPillar’s son was a stone-eye, an accomplished son-in-law\nmight become heir to No Peak, so the thinking went. At least a\ndozen prominent No Peak families had approached Hilo about\nintroducing their eligible sons—ranging from age fourteen to\nforty—to his daughter. He ignored them, or responded, “When\nshe’s old enough, I’m going to hold a tournament to the death\nfor Jaya’s suitors.” Coming from any ordinary protective\nfather, this would’ve elicited laughter, but as this was Kaul\nHiloshudon, the laughter was nervous enough to shut people\nup.\n“If it was over between the two of you, then why this\nmess?”\n“He was following me and Hana around all night,” Jaya\ncomplained. “Always trying to get Hana’s attention. Maybe he\nwas really into her, or maybe he was just trying to make me\njealous. I don’t know and I don’t care. Anyway, the two of\nthem went upstairs at some point. I was hanging out\ndownstairs playing pool with everyone else when Hana started\nfreaking out. Seriously, Da! I could Perceive it like—” Jaya\nmade an explosive motion around her own head.\n“What were you even doing wearing jade off Academy\ngrounds?” Hilo demanded. Jaya was still three months away\nfrom graduation and not allowed to wear jade without adult\nGreen Bone supervision. “And wearing it hidden, no less, like\nsome sort of thief,” Hilo added, his temper rising. “Hand it\nover.”\nJaya groaned and rolled up the cuff of her jeans, taking off\nthe Academy-issued training bracelet she’d fastened to her\nankle. She made a face at the discomfort of coming off jade,\nthen smacked the leather band and its three stones resentfully\ninto her father’s outstretched hand. “It’s a good thing for Hana\nthat I was wearing it,” she pointed out. “What if he’d tried that\nshit with me?”\n“He wouldn’t have dared,” Hilo replied. “Mal Ging is the\nonly son of Councilman Mal Joon. You’re lucky he didn’t\nbleed to death. It would’ve been a lot of trouble to deal with,\nnot to mention you would’ve gotten yourself expelled.”"

What are you so upset about? You think\nthis is the first boy I’ve screwed? Or the first one I’ve knifed?”\nShe laughed at his staring face.\nIt occurred to Hilo that his daughter deserved a sound\nbeating, but he’d never been able to find it in his heart to treat\nJaya harshly. She was a girl, and his youngest. “She craves\nyour attention and she knows how to get it,” Wen had said\ncrossly on more than one occasion.\n“What am I supposed to do about you, Jaya-se?” Hilo\ngrowled, more to himself than to her. “We have to make some\namends to the Mals.”\n“I’m not giving them my ear,” Jaya insisted, crossing her\narms and sticking out her lower lip. “They don’t deserve it,\nand also I don’t feel sorry for what I did to that asshole. I don’t\nsee why we have to do shit for the Mals. If anything, they\nshould make amends to Noyu Hana and her family. Would you\napologize simply for defending a friend? Come on, Da, I’ve\nheard all the stories about you.”\n“At least I never stabbed a classmate in the groin with a\ntalon knife!” Hilo’s eyes narrowed. “And what stories are you\ntalking about?”\nJaya looked at her father with the particular cutting\nexasperation mastered by teenage girls. “You know, stories\nfrom when you were a Fist. Like what you did to Tanku Din.\nOr about you as the Horn. Or the ones about the war with the\nMountain.”\n“Don’t throw around examples you know nothing about.”\nJaya got to her feet and wandered around the study\ndespondently. “No one will duel me, you know. Even if I offer\nthem a clean blade, they’re afraid if they scratch me, you’ll\ntear them limb from limb. That’s why Ging didn’t try to rape\nme and went after Hana instead, the coward. How am I\nsupposed to earn any jade after I graduate, much less become a\nFist? It’s hard enough to be a woman who’s green, even for\nsomeone on the boring side of the clan like Aunt Shae.”\nHilo was so astonished he forgot his anger over the\nmaiming of the Mal boy. Jaya had always been the child he’d\nfound easiest to understand and love. He recalled that when\nshe was a little girl, she could be exhausting; she rarely napped\nor stopped moving, wanting him to chase her or push her on\nthe swing set for much longer than either of the boys, until she\nwas near to throwing up. She was always open with her\nfeelings and seemed to live in the moment. Hilo hadn’t known\nsuch anxious thoughts about being a woman Green Bone were\non her mind, even though he realized now that it shouldn’t\nhave been a surprise.

We\nshouldn’t have left it this long, that’s my fault, but it’s been\nbusy and there’s still plenty of time, so don’t worry. There’re a\nlot of things you could do. You could go to college. You could\nstudy in Espenia if you want. You could spend a year or two as\na Finger. Or there are plenty of tributary companies in the clan\nwhere you could intern.”\nJaya sat up. “I’m taking oaths to the greener side of the\nclan, Da. I’m going to become a first-rank Fist. One day I’ll be\nthe Horn of No Peak.”\nHilo hated to discourage any of his children, but now he\nsaid, “The Horn is the greenest, most dangerous position.\nThere’s never been a woman Horn.”\n“There wasn’t a woman Pillar before Ayt Mada,” Jaya\nretorted. “Are you saying our enemies can do more than we\ncan? I’m your daughter! Don’t you believe in me?” She was\nsuddenly almost distraught.\n“Of course I believe in you,” Hilo snapped. “But being the\nHorn … It’s not just about being a good fighter or a Kaul or\nwearing the most jade. It’s …” He frowned; he was having a\nhard time articulating why the idea of his daughter aspiring to\nthe position he’d once held disturbed him so greatly. The Horn\nneeded to be a top warrior, cunning and calculating, a leader of\nmen. Even among extremely capable and heavily jaded Green\nBones, few were suited for the demands of the role. Most of\nall, he was fearful of Jaya having such a lofty and perilous\nambition, one that might get her killed at a young age, and his\ninstinct as her father was to steer her toward a part of the clan\nthat was less violent. “You’re not even eighteen yet,” he\nreminded her reasonably. “You should think about all your\noptions and not set your mind on one thing so soon.”\nJaya leapt to her feet, eyes flashing with hurt and\nindignation. “Don’t say that! Don’t make me out to be a silly\ngirl with silly ideas.

He could’ve guessed\nJaya would grow up to be hopelessly green, and as he’d told\nShae earlier in the evening, it was a mistake to try to push\npeople in directions they weren’t meant to go, or to push them\naway from what they most wanted.\n“All right,” he said. “If you’re serious about being a Fist,\nI’ll talk to Lott Jin. We’ll think about who might be good\nmentors, how you can get the most opportunities to earn jade.\nBetween now and the end of the year, you should be talking to\nthe senior Fists, getting a sense of which ones you respect the\nmost and might like to be placed under. Talk to the woman\nFingers, especially, to find out their opinions.” He cut off his\ndaughter’s growing smile with a growl. “All of this happens\nonly if you behave perfectly for the rest of the year and\ngraduate from the Academy with four jade stones and no more\nproblems, or I’ll jade-strip you myself and send you to be the\nlowest-level Luckbringer in the most boring job I can find in\nsome tiny tribute property, I swear to Heaven.”\nJaya came over and put her arms around her father’s neck\nand kissed his cheek sweetly, all of her teenage bluster and\npique gone. “I promise I won’t disappoint you, Da.” I won’t be\nlike Niko. She didn’t say the words, but he knew it was what\nshe meant. Despite his apprehension, Hilo hugged her back\nand said, “It’s late. You should go to bed. I’ll drive you back to\nthe Academy tomorrow.”\nOne of the Fingers who guarded the estate knocked on the\ndoor of the study. “Kaul-jen,” he said when Hilo opened the\ndoor, “the Noyu family is here to see you.”\nHilo went out of the room to find four people waiting\nanxiously in the entry foyer. A trembling teenage girl of Jaya’s\nage, her parents, and a young Green Bone who was surely her\nbrother. Upon seeing Hilo, they all bent into deep and\nrespectful salutes. The mother’s eyes were teary, and the\nfather’s face was pale as he stepped forward with his eyes\ndowncast. “Kaul-jen,” he said, “we’ve come here to show our\ngratitude for what your daughter did, defending Hana from\nharm, not to mention our family’s honor and reputation. We\nheard that Jaya spent hours in jail, and it surely ruined your\nevening.” He swallowed noisily. “Our family is small, but my\nson is a Finger in the clan, and our daughter hopes to become a\nLuckbringer. If there’s ever any greater way we can be of\nservice to the No Peak clan and to your family, we would\nundertake it gladly.”\nNoyu knelt on the hardwood floor and touched his head to\nthe ground.

We both had too much to drink, and\nI didn’t—”\n“Be quiet, girl,” Hana’s mother hissed at her. “Haven’t you\ncaused enough trouble already?”\nJaya went to her friend and pulled her to her feet. “How\ncan you think it was your fault at all?” she exclaimed angrily.\n“Ging was a worthless little shit. Why do you think I broke up\nwith him in the first place? And even though it’s very kind for\nyour whole family to come here to show your thanks, it’s\nhardly needed, because what’s the point of friends if we don’t\ndefend each other?” She hugged her classmate tightly. “I don’t\ncare at all about spending time in jail, I’m only glad you’re\nsafe.”\nHana began to cry in earnest, and would’ve stayed there,\nclinging to Jaya, if her parents and brother didn’t pull her\naway, saying the Pillar’s family had given entirely too much\ntime to them already. Hilo was a little bewildered by the\nfeeling that he had absolutely nothing to add to the situation,\nother than to place a hand on Noyu’s shoulder and thank him\nfor coming.\nThe man’s lips trembled with emotion. “Kaul-jen, not only\nare you the Pillar, but you’re managing to raise children\nwho’re as green and good-hearted as you are. Looking at you,\nI feel humbled as a father.”\nCHAPTER\n41\nSecond Chance\nT\nhree men stood in excited expectation in front of Bad Keck\nRemi and his two bodyguards. It was past midnight and the\nFeast of Janloon restaurant had closed an hour ago; the six\nmen were the only people remaining on the second floor. The\nsingle window was cracked open to dispel Resville’s\nunseasonably warm spring heat, but the blinds were drawn and\nthe lights were dimmed to create an atmosphere of solemnity.\n“For centuries, our ancestors claimed the jade off the\nbodies of their enemies.” Jon Remi spoke with an air of\nceremony as he unfolded a black cloth on the table. He’d\ngiven this speech many times before and was well practiced at\nthe ritual. “Only the strongest could wear jade. Once they had\nit, they had to fight to keep it. Kill or be killed. It’s part of our\nculture. It’s in our blood. Tonight, we continue a tradition\nhanded down to us from generations of jade warriors.” Remi\nlaid out three identical gold chains, each with a jade\nmedallion. A reverential hush fell over the Snakeheads.\nJade was hard to obtain—thanks to those greedy fucks in\nthe Kekonese clans—so Remi was extremely discerning about\nwho he elevated as Vipers. The three men in front of him had\nall been in the gang for a year and proven themselves by\ncarrying out at least two assigned killings. “You’ve all earned"

The three men in front of him had\nall been in the gang for a year and proven themselves by\ncarrying out at least two assigned killings. “You’ve all earned\nthis,” Remi said. “As soon as you put it on, there’s no going\nback.” Remi raised his tattooed arms. “Who are we?”\n“The Snakeheads!” The men forked their fingers in the\ngang salute.\nRemi called forward the first young man from the line,\nwho’d shown his thick blood by executing two members of the\nCopa cartel. The Snakeheads were currently playing spoiler in\nthe war between the Copas and the allied East Resville and\nCranston Crews. Remi hated both sides and had been in\nviolent confrontation with them both before, but enmities and\nalliances were always shifting in Resville.\nRemi placed the chain with the jade medallion over the\nbowed head of the new-made Viper. A look of awe came into\nthe man’s face and his energy changed, rose in pitch as it\nbegan to hum with jade power. From now on, he would have\nto train every day with the other Vipers to control and use his\nnew abilities, and he would need daily injections of SN2.\nRemi had heard that in Kekon, Green Bones didn’t use shine\nat all because they were exposed to jade as children—another\nold country privilege. Fortunately, Remi had plenty of shine to\ngo around and the drug was safer than it used to be. There had\nonly been three deaths from overdose among the Snakeheads\nin the past year, and that was preferable to even one case of the\nItches. The one man Remi had seen die of the Itches had gone\nout in a bad way, killing his own wife and children with a\ncleaver before turning it on himself.\nWith a dazed look on his face, the first man stepped back\nand Remi motioned forward the second Snakehead in line, a\nhalf-Kekonese ex-con who’d left Migu Sun’s outfit in\nAdamont Capita and had proven himself by hijacking a Copa\ndrug shipment and killing three dealers. Over the years, the\nCopas had taken over most of the region’s drug trade by\nbringing narcotics—primarily amphetamines like sweet flour\nand buzz—across the border from Tomascio. They had a\nreputation for indiscriminate savagery; in their own country, it\nwas common for the drug lords to leave dismembered bodies\nnailed to fences as a warning to their enemies.\nThe Crew Bosses of Resville were not about to be muscled\nout by the wesps, but they were also afraid of inciting\nprolonged violence in a major Espenian tourist city, so they\nhad reluctantly hired the Bad Keck to do the difficult work for\nthem. The Snakeheads were not the most populous gang in\nResville, but everyone in the Espenian underworld agreed that\nman for man, you couldn’t get more efficient killers than those\njade-wearing Kekonese. In exchange for this service, the East\nResville and Cranston Crews had agreed to cede all the\ngambling and prostitution business on the glitzy eastside\nLaholla Street to the Snakeheads. A worthwhile trade, in\nRemi’s book.\nThe second man accepted his new jade and stepped back,"

A worthwhile trade, in\nRemi’s book.\nThe second man accepted his new jade and stepped back,\nclutching it in his fist.\nGoing up against the Copas was no joke, and even though\nit got the Crews off his back, Remi would’ve hesitated to take\non such a challenge were it not for certain assets that no one\nelse in the city possessed. One was his jade-wearing Vipers.\nThe other was the third and final man standing in front of him\nnow.\nMaik Tar was at least twenty-five years older than the\nother two men who were being promoted today, and he looked\nevery bit of it. But he was the most reliable man among the\nSnakeheads. At first, as he did with all new members, Remi\nhad given Maik simple tasks—make a delivery, shake\nsomeone down, hand out a bribe or a beating, as necessary.\nMaik did them all to perfection, without batting an eye. Remi\nsent him to murder a man, a former Snakehead who’d gone to\nthe police. The informer disappeared the following day; the\npolice never found a trace of him.\nRemi was delighted and a little shaken. He sent Maik out\non other jobs and Maik never failed. The man was a steely\nkiller. A savage genius. Last month, three Copas had robbed\none of Remi’s bookies, beaten him to death, and escaped town.\nRemi had given Maik two men and sent him after the thieves.\nMaik left the trio of charred bodies burning in a car at a gas\nstation eight kilometers from the Tomascio border.\nUnlike some other members of the Snakeheads gang, Maik\nTar didn’t drink or do drugs, he didn’t start senseless fights, he\ndidn’t have a wife or a mistress, he never talked back or\nquestioned the work that Remi gave him. He was a league\nabove the others in terms of his exceptional instinct for street\noperations and violence. He noticed and remembered crucial\ndetails, he emanated dangerous authority, and he was always\ngood in a fight. Remi could only imagine what Maik must’ve\nbeen like as a young man. So this, Remi mused with jealous\nresentment, was the kind of work ethic and discipline you\ncould find in the old country clans. These were the sort of\npeople that the Kauls had. Nothing like some of the slipshod\nfuckups he had to deal with.\nAnd Maik had done it all without jade. How much more\ncould he accomplish after tonight? The other two men had\nnever worn jade before and it would be months before they\ncould do anything useful with it. Maik had worn a great deal\nof jade for decades before his exile. Remi lifted the final chain,\nand with everyone watching, he undid the clasp and slid two\nmore precious jade medallions next to the first. It was the most\njade he’d ever handed out at once, but Maik could handle it.\nIndeed, he would become an unstoppable force. With Maik at\nthe head of his Vipers, Remi could wreak destruction on the\nCopa cartel and anyone else who dared to be his enemy.\nMaik’s eyes widened. Remi could feel the man’s almost"

Remi could feel the man’s almost\nunbearable anticipation. “Once again, and from now on, a\nGreen Bone warrior,” Remi said with a savage grin. “Maik-\njen.”\nMaik bent his head and Remi placed the chain over his\nneck. The man reached up and pressed the green medallions\nagainst his bare skin, shivering as the rush of jade energy hit\nhis brain for the first time in nearly fourteen years. His\nroughened face lit with pure joy and triumph as he raised it\ntoward the ceiling as if in transcendent communion with the\ngods. “Thank you,” he whispered hoarsely. “Thank you for\nthis second chance.”\nWith the incredible speed and Strength of an Academy-\ntrained first-rank Fist, Maik Tar drove his Steeled fingers\nthrough Remi’s throat, crushing his trachea.\nRemi’s bodyguards and the other Snakeheads in the room\nwere immobile with astonishment for two full seconds before\nthey drew their guns. In that time, Tar seized the closest man\nand Channeled into his brain, bursting the vessels and killing\nhim instantly. He threw the body into the second guard,\nbowling him over, and took off running as the remaining\nSnakeheads opened fire.\nThe Deflections that Tar hurled behind himself diverted\nmost of the gunshots, but not all of them. He was using his\njade abilities for the first time after a long absence and\nstruggling as one might with a numbed limb. He was also\nmuch older than he’d been as a Green Bone in Janloon.\nA bullet punched through Tar’s shoulder and another\ncaught him in the thigh, causing him to stumble and fall. The\nenraged gang members set upon him with knives. They didn’t\nhave any idea how to use their new jade, but it still made them\nfaster and stronger than they otherwise would be. Tar cut open\nthe ex-con’s face and dropped him to the floor screaming, but\nwas too slow with his Steel and suffered a bad slash to the ribs\nhimself. He was so vicious and terrifying with the talon knife\nhowever, snarling like a rabid animal, that the two remaining\nmen hesitated to be the next to attack. That gave Tar the few\nseconds he needed to throw himself out of the restaurant’s\nonly second-story window, shattering it with his Steeled body.\nHe crashed into the railing of the fire escape and tumbled\nover it toward the pavement. Controlling his fall with\nLightness, he landed on his feet amid a shower of glass and the\nscreams of bystanders, spraining his ankle in the process. Tar\nran limping into the street and covered a block and a half,\ntrailing blood behind him, before two Resville city police cars\nshowed up and he surrendered to them without a fight.\n_______\nIn the hospital, under strict police guard, Tar was allowed a\nprivate phone call to contact his family. He used it to call Hilo\nlong distance on an unlisted number that had been known only\nto the immediate members of the Kaul family back when he\nwas Pillarman and that he was relieved to discover still\nworked."

It was\nthe first time the two men had spoken since that terrible night\nso many years ago.\nHilo said, “Don’t say anything to the cops. We’re sending\na lawyer to you. We’ll get you out of there, Tar.”\nWhen he’d learned that Jon Remi was dead, and that the\nassassin had been none other than his former Pillarman, Hilo\nhad been assailed by the surreal sensation of being shocked\nand entirely not shocked at the same time. Now he felt as if\nhe’d been thrust into the past to that awful moment when he’d\nstood under the trees at the back of the Kaul property with a\ntalon knife in his hand and Tar kneeling in front of him, and\nhis hands were shaking on the phone receiver as they had been\non the knife. “We’ll push on the legal side, and if that doesn’t\nwork, we’ll figure out something else. Remember, don’t say\nanything, and don’t worry. Just get better and be patient.” He\npaused to steady himself. “You did good, Tar.”\nAfter a long moment, Tar said, “It’s good to hear your\nvoice, Hilo-jen.”\n“You know I’ve always counted on you more than\nanyone,” Hilo said. “Call me again in a few days, after you’ve\ntalked to the lawyer. You’ll be okay.”\nTar did not phone the Kaul house again. While still\nrecovering in the hospital, he was questioned by police\ndetectives, and with an interpreter present to help him answer\nquestions, he explained that he was a member of the\nSnakeheads gang. He said he’d been summoned to the\nrestaurant to be killed because Jon Remi suspected he was a\nspy for the Kekonese clans, who were opposed to jade being\nused by criminal groups. Tar claimed to have killed Remi in\nself-defense. He cooperated fully with the authorities, naming\nall the known members of the Snakeheads, providing the\nlocations of their hideouts, and giving detailed evidence of the\ncrimes they had been involved in.\n_______\nCory Dauk arrived not long thereafter to visit Maik Tar in jail\nand provide him legal counsel. The lawyer remembered Maik\nall the way back from Kaul Hilo’s first visit to Espenia. Cory\nhad been only a young law school student back then, and Maik\nTar had been the Pillar’s aide, a man every bit as intimidating\nas Rohn Toro had been. Now Maik was grizzled, tired, and\npale from his time in the hospital before he’d been transferred\nto jail. He’d reacquired jade for a few minutes, expended an\nenormous amount of energy, and then lost it again upon being\ntaken into custody by the police.

His\ninjuries hadn’t been life threatening, but the bullet in his leg\nhad chipped the femur and he was likely to walk with a limp\nfor the rest of his life.\nMaik asked if he could have a cigarette, and even though\nCory didn’t smoke himself, he asked the guards if any of them\nwould spare one for the prisoner. Tar accepted the smoke\ngratefully, lit up, and sank into the metal chair with a look of\ncontentedness, closing his eyes.\n“You shouldn’t have spilled everything you know to the\ncops before I got here,” Cory said. “We’ve lost a lot of\nleverage that we could’ve used to bargain.”\nMaik didn’t answer, merely taking another pull on the\ncigarette, eyes still closed.\n“You’ll probably get fifteen to twenty years in a\nmaximum-security prison,” Cory explained to him, annoyed\nbut remaining professional. “Because of how cooperative\nyou’ve been with the police, we can get that taken down,\nmaybe to ten years. When you get out, you’ll be given a new\nidentity and placed in a witness protection program in another\ncity, where no one can find you and you can start life over\nagain.”\n“I’ve done that already before.” Tar opened his eyes\nhalfway, supremely unimpressed by the idea. “I’d be nearly\nsixty by the time I got out. Too old.”\nCory looked at Maik for a long moment. “They’re trying to\nget you out, you know. No Peak.” The two men were speaking\nin Kekonese and none of the guards standing nearby could\nunderstand them. “Your old boss Kaul Hilo is asking about all\nthe ways to tie up the court process, bribing cops and judges.\nHe wants details about prison security. If you end up behind\nbars, they’ll do whatever they possibly can to free you.”\nTar smiled, with satisfaction but also sadness. “They\nshouldn’t do that.”\n“No,” Cory agreed. “It would involve breaking a lot of\nlaws, and it would throw the spotlight onto your past ties with\nthe clan. I’ve been trying to tell them that, but I’m not sure\nyour Pillar will listen. If you could convince your family that\nthey shouldn’t interfere in the legal process, it would be better\nfor everyone in the long run, yourself included.”\n“Thanks for the advice,” Tar said. “I’ll try to convince\nthem.”\nCory studied Maik with unease. “Why did you do it?”\nTar smirked. “Are you asking as my lawyer?”\nCory shook his head slowly. “Anden came to see you,\ndidn’t he? He asked you to deal with Jon Remi.”\nTar was amused by the flat tone of the lawyer’s voice that\nsuggested the man was quelling a sense of horror. He finished\nhis cigarette and ground it out against the surface of the metal\ntable that separated them. “Remi made the wrong enemy,” he\nsaid simply. “You don’t stand in the way of the No Peak clan.”\n“You’re not a Green Bone of No Peak anymore. You can’t\never return to Kekon. So, why? What’s in it for you?”\nTar shrugged. “A death of consequence.” He could tell that"

It’s a Green Bone thing back in the old country, not\nsomething they do over here.”\nCHAPTER\n42\nDeath of Consequence\nE\nighteen months earlier, Anden had made a trip to Orslow, a\nsouthern suburb of Port Massy with a growing Kekonese\npopulation. When he arrived at the brown bungalow on the\ncorner, Anden saw a man mowing the front lawn but didn’t\nrecognize him at first. The idea of Maik Tar sweating and\npushing a lawn mower in the sun outside his modest home,\nlike an ordinary neighbor on a Seventhday afternoon, was\nbeyond what Anden could’ve ever imagined. As he got out of\nthe car and crossed the street, Tar squinted in his direction. He\nturned off the lawn mower and watched, eyes widening in\nastonishment as Anden approached. Then he broke into a wide\ngrin and came to meet the younger man.\n“Hello, Tar,” Anden said.\n“Godsdamn. It’s good to see you, kid.” The two men\nembraced and Tar led the way up the short walk to the house.\nInside, Tar turned and put his hands on Anden’s shoulders,\nsqueezing, as if to make sure that it was really him, that he was\nreally there. “Godsdamn,” he said again. “I wish I’d known\nyou were coming.” He spun in sudden agitation, opening his\nfridge. “You want something to drink? All I’ve got is soda, but\nI could run out to get something else.” He glanced around the\nkitchen and a look of embarrassment came into his face as he\nrealized how small and meager his place must appear, for a\nman who had been one of the most powerful and feared Green\nBones in Janloon, the right hand of the Pillar.\n“A soda’s fine,” Anden said. Tar brought back a couple of\nbottles and they sat down together at the table. “How’re you\ndoing here?” Anden asked cautiously. The last time he’d seen\nTar had been on that tragic night when he’d treated the\nPillarman’s injuries and helped to wash the blood off his hands\nand face. Looking at him now, Anden didn’t know how to feel.\nHe’d thought of Maik Tar as a brother-in-law, but he hadn’t\nbeen close to the man and had never been entirely at ease\naround him. Tar had always seemed so sharp and dangerous, a\nwolf that only Hilo and Kehn could control. Still, Anden had\nknown Tar for so long, had eaten dinner with him at the Kaul\nhouse so often, it was hard to think of him as the man who’d\nmurdered Iyn Ro. It didn’t occur to Anden to consider the\nother lives Tar had taken. Those had been on the Pillar’s orders\nand done for the good of the clan.\nTar shrugged. “I’m not complaining,” he said. “You know,\nI’m okay. I’m better than I was. It took me years to stop hating"

It took me years to stop hating\neverything, including myself. No jade, no clan, no family,\nnothing. The only reason I didn’t kill myself was because\nHilo-jen had spared my life and I thought maybe, just maybe,\nthere was a tiny chance I could be forgiven and come back one\nday.” Tar’s eyes went a little distant, and he shook his head. “I\nknow it’s not possible,” he said, but the slightest bit of a\nquestion lingered in his voice and the quick, sidelong glance at\nhis visitor showed that when he’d seen Anden crossing the\nstreet toward his house, he’d still felt a stir of hope.\n“It’s a good thing you were able to feel at home here,\neventually,” Anden said. He had to hide the sympathy he felt\nupon seeing the small spark of possibility go out of Tar’s eyes,\nslackening the muscles around the man’s mouth. Tar was the\nsame age as Hilo, but in his exile, he’d aged badly. His fingers\nand wrists and neck seemed indecently bare, devoid of the jade\nhe’d carried all his adult life in Janloon.\n“Yeah.” Tar’s posture slumped a little. “I lost my jade, but\nI had enough money to live on when I arrived. There were a\ncouple of guys, Green Bones who answered to the old Dauk,\nwho checked in on me to make sure I was okay, but also told\nme they’d put me down like a mad dog if they had to.” Tar\nsmiled a little.\n“When did you move to Orslow?” Anden asked. He\nwouldn’t have thought Tar would ever be in a place like this,\nquiet and residential. He’d always seemed like a creature of\nthe city, at least back in Janloon.\n“A couple of years ago.” Tar glanced out the window as if\ntaken aback to realize that he’d indeed been here for that long.\n“It’s … different here. Cheaper, sure, that’s good, but also …”\nHe rubbed his jaw, searching for how to explain. “Southtrap’s\ngot jade medicine clinics now. And jade schools that fly under\nthe radar. We started sending Fists over to train Dauk’s people\nfifteen years ago, and some of them go to Janloon now and\ncome back. Out here in Orslow, there aren’t any Green\nBones.”\nAnden understood. It would be painful for Tar to be around\njade and Green Bones, to be constantly reminded of who he\nused to be. And yet, even now, when he spoke of No Peak\nsending Fists to Port Massy, he’d said we, as if he were still a\nleader in the clan. Anden asked, “How about work? Do you\nhave a job out here?”\n“I started out as a bouncer at a club downtown. Stupid,\nboring work, but it was easy,” Tar told him. “After a while, it\noccurred to me that what I was doing wasn’t all that different\nfrom what the lowestlevel Fingers do—stand around, look\ntough, deal with trouble when it happens.

I didn’t have jade\nanymore but I knew how to be more than a junior Finger. I’d\nbeen Second Fist of the clan, I’d been Pillarman.” A flicker of\nfierce light came into Tar’s eyes for a mere second. “So I\nstarted doing some work on my own. I’d been avoiding the\ngrudge halls—gods, they’re so tacky, you’d never find\nanything like that in Janloon—but I started going to them and\nspreading my name a bit. After I did some jobs, I got other\npeople wanting to hire me. It’s mostly tracking down guys\nwho owe money or cheaters who ran out on their wives,\ngetting dirt on someone, that sort of thing. Sometimes it’s\nmore interesting. The work comes and goes, but it pays the\nbills.”\nTar sat in sheepish silence for a few seconds, then said to\nAnden in a much more lively voice, “What about you, kid?” as\nif Anden was still Hilo-jen’s teenage cousin and not an\naccomplished doctor and thirty-eight years old. “You look\ngood. What’s going on at home these days? Are you in\nEspenia on clan business?”\nIn broad strokes, Anden filled Tar in on happenings in No\nPeak and with the family. Tar listened avidly, hungrily, asking\nafter each of the kids, especially Cam, who was a year-six at\nthe Academy, one year behind Jaya. At the time, Niko had\nbeen a senior Finger and Ru was in his final year of high\nschool. Anden had brought photos, knowing that Tar would be\nhappy to have them. The former Pillarman looked through\nthem all carefully and in silence, except when he gave a snort\nof laughter at some funny picture or silly expression on one of\nhis nephews’ faces.\nHe paused for a long moment on a candid photograph of\nHilo and Wen, sitting together in the stands at one of Ru’s high\nschool relayball games. It had been taken by someone sitting\nnext to them, perhaps Shae. They were smiling for the camera\nand looked happy.\nTar finished going through the photographs, then turned\naway and rubbed quickly and surreptitiously at his eyes.\n“Thanks for bringing those.”\n“They’re yours to keep.” Anden glanced away, not\nwanting to injure the man’s pride by sounding too concerned.\n“Have you met people here? Made friends?” The house was\nobviously a bachelor’s residence, with utilitarian furniture,\nlittle in the way of interior decor, and one set of used dishes in\nthe sink.\n“A few,” said Tar. “Started playing cards with some guys I\nmet at the gym. Got into a book group with the Espenian as a\nSecond Language Conversation Club at the library. A few\nflings here and there, nothing serious. Never got married,\nthough. Couldn’t do it, after … you know.” He squared the\npile of photographs.\nAnden was struck by an odd mixture of pity and\nadmiration.

Tar had had none of that. He was older and it\nwas hard for him to learn another language. He’d had to go\nthrough jade withdrawal, find work, rebuild his life entirely.\nThat he was not only alive, but had a modest house in the\nsuburbs, work that suited him, and a few social connections—\nit was nothing short of a miracle. A decade and an ocean away\nfrom the Green Bone life that had defined him, Maik Tar was\nboth broken and more whole. “It’s good to see you, Tar,”\nAnden said, and he meant it.\nTar cleared his throat and gave the stack of photographs\nanother pat before raising his eyes to Anden with expectant\nunderstanding. “And how’s clan business?”\nDespite his happiness to see a member of the family and\nthe chance to hear about how everyone was doing, Tar surely\nknew that Anden’s visit could not merely be out of kindness\nand sentiment. Although Hilo had not expressly forbidden\ncommunication with Tar, it was understood that he was dead to\nthe clan. The Pillar himself hadn’t spoken to his brother-in-law\nsince exiling him. Anden knew this wasn’t out of cruelty, but\nkindness. It would be wrong to give the man any shred of\nhope. He needed to be cut off in order to accept his situation\nand make some sort of new life for himself. And Hilo did not\ntrust himself not to soften toward Tar in time and he could not\nallow himself to do that. But Maik Tar knew enough Green\nBones in Espenia to have learned by now that when Emery\nAnden was in the country, he spoke for the Pillar of No Peak.\nAnden said, “Doing business here is more challenging for\nus now that Dauk Losun is gone—let the gods recognize him.”\nAnden told Tar about No Peak’s efforts to change the\nperception of jade in Espenia and remove legal barriers that\nstood in the way of the clan’s expansion. Some Green Bones,\nhe explained, were defying the urgings of their peers and\ninstead becoming notorious criminals.\n“There’s one man in particular,” Anden said with a\ngrimace. “Remi Jonjunin, or Jon Remi, who’s called Bad Keck\nRemi, just like a Crew Boss. And the worst thing is that he\nbuilt his success on No Peak.” He told Tar about the history of\nRemi’s alliance with No Peak, his rise in Resville and his\nrefusal to change his ways now that he was rich and powerful.\n“No one can talk any sense into him. Last month, two of his\nmen, one of them wearing jade, were busted running a shine\nlab. Remi’s Snakeheads stand in the way of everything No\nPeak is trying to accomplish in this country.”\nTar asked matter-of-factly, “Has anyone tried to kill him\nyet?”\n“The Crews have tried,” Anden said. “But Remi is too\ncareful. He has at least three different apartments and moves"

He has at least three different apartments and moves\nbetween them. He only eats in Kekonese restaurants and\nwherever he goes, he sends people ahead to scout it out. He\nhas jade-wearing bodyguards with him at all times. No\ncrewboy assassin could get close.”\nTar nodded. “And what about other Green Bones?”\n“The Green Bones in Port Massy and Adamont Capita\nhave tried to negotiate with Remi and rein him in, but they\nwon’t whisper his name. They don’t want to create more legal\ntroubles and make everything worse for the community, or\nturn themselves into targets of vengeance for Remi’s\nfollowers. So they’ve been working with the police to shut\ndown his businesses and have him arrested, hoping that’ll take\ncare of the problem, or that the Crews will eventually\nsucceed.”\nTar shook his head. “This sort of thing would never happen\nin Janloon.”\n“They can’t help it,” Anden said, feeling compelled to\ndefend Cory Dauk and his Keko-Espenian friends. “Without a\nclan or Pillar, without people like Dauk Losun and Rohn Toro,\nthey don’t know how to act like real Green Bones. Even so,\nthey’re our allies and business partners. Even after Remi\ninsulted us directly, Hilo-jen gave Dauk’s widow his word that\nhe would keep No Peak out of Resville and not do anything to\ncreate negative attention.” Anden paused and looked at Tar\nmeaningfully. “The Bad Keck is an enemy of the clan, and the\nPillar wants him gone. Since I’m the one who’s most familiar\nwith the situation in Espenia, it’s up to me to figure out the\nright way to handle this problem, in a way that can’t be traced\nback to No Peak.”\nTar said, “Trust me, as someone who’s been in your shoes,\ngetting difficult assignments straight from the Pillar, I\nwouldn’t trust a job like this to just anybody.”\nAnden said, “Hilo doesn’t know I’m here.”\nTar raised his eyebrows and sat back. Anden could tell the\nformer Pillarman was disappointed. He’d no doubt hoped that\nAnden’s visit had been suggested, or at least condoned, by the\nPillar. But Tar was nevertheless flattered Anden had come to\nhim, even after all these years, and that he was willing to risk\nhis own standing with the Pillar by seeking out a clan pariah\nwithout Hilo’s knowledge and blessing.\nTar got up and brought back a couple more bottles of soda.\nWhen he sat back down, it was clear from the furrow in his\nbrow that he was thinking about everything Anden had said.\n“You promise killing this man will be good for the clan? That\nit’ll be helpful to Hilo-jen?”\n“Yes,” Anden said. “I wouldn’t be here if that wasn’t the\ncase.”\n“This Jon Remi. Does he deserve to die?”\nThe question caught Anden off guard.

But Tar was\nlooking at him steadily, expecting an answer, and with an\nexpression on his face that seemed unlike him, the face of a\nman who had been asking a lot of questions in the past decade\nof his life and was still hoping for answers.\nAnden thought for a minute before replying. “Remi is what\nhe is. In some ways, he’s admirable because he wants to live\nas his own man, and he demands respect for himself even\nwhen it seems everything is against him. But he uses jade only\nto prey on others. He extorts even Kekonese businesses. He’s\nkilled many people, but always for money or drugs, never with\na clean blade. His Snakeheads are no better than crewboys.”\nAnden paused. “He’s not the sort of Green Bone that should be\nallowed to exist. So he deserves to die as much as anyone in\nour world does.”\nTar was silent for a while. The answer had been more\nthought out and honest than he’d expected, and he appreciated\nAnden showing him—a disgraced, exiled clan murderer—\nenough respect not to lie to him or give him a pat response.\nTar stood and they walked together to the door. He said, “I’ll\nalways do what Hilo-jen needs done. Don’t worry about a\nthing, kid.”\nAs Anden stepped out the door of the small house, Tar\nasked, “Will you tell the boys, especially Cam, that their uncle\nTar misses them and loves them? I know some mistakes can’t\never be fixed, but we’ve got to go on, don’t we, and try to\nmake the most of what’s left. Tell them for me, all right?”\n_______\nThe downfall of the Snakeheads was shockingly rapid even by\nthe standards of the Resville underworld. The city police and\nfederal authorities had never before received so much insider\ninformation about the country’s most notorious Keko-\nEspenian gang. Within a week of Remi’s death, they’d arrested\nnearly all the Bad Keck’s direct subordinates and charged\nthem with a slate of crimes.\nThe remaining Snakeheads were unable to reorganize\nquickly enough to survive the onslaught by law enforcement\nand the opportunistic attacks by the Copa cartel and the local\nCrews. Those of Remi’s followers who managed to evade\narrest went into hiding, fled the city, or left behind their\nactivities and associations. Some of them went so far as to stop\nwearing jade. A few minor splinter gangs emerged, but they\nstayed strictly small-time and were looked down upon as being\nsimple crooks. They had little or no jade and now none of the\nGreen Bone leaders who sided with the Dauk family in Port\nMassy would grant jade to anyone with a criminal record.\nThe Crews moved quickly to take over the void left by the\nremoval of the Snakeheads. Within a short time they brokered\na tenuous agreement with the Copas, leaving their rivals most\nof the drug trade but reasserting control over the gambling,\nprostitution, and racketeering in most parts of Resville, except\nin the predominantly Kekonese areas, where they were liable"

The message spread: Train in secret,\nwear your jade, protect your neighborhoods. If you become\ntoo greedy and make yourself into a Crew Boss, you’ll end up\nthe same as Jon Remi, who paid for his defiance and\ndisrespect to the Kaul family of No Peak.\nWhile awaiting trial two months after his arrest, Maik Tar\nwas found dead in his prison cell, having hanged himself with\na torn bedsheet. Earlier that day, he’d walked around the\nprison yard in apparently good spirits, having nearly fully\nrecovered from his injuries. He’d eaten dinner and joked with\nthe guards and not been considered a suicide risk. He did not\nleave any note, although that evening he talked at length about\nhis older brother, who’d been dead for eighteen years, and he\nsaid that he hoped there really was life after death, as some\npeople said.\nMaik Tar’s body was sent back to his family in Janloon\nand buried next to Kehn in the Kaul family plot in the Heaven\nAwaiting Cemetery. The funeral was not widely known about\neven within the No Peak clan; many friends and relatives of\nIyn Ro would be angry that the Pillar had ended Tar’s exile\neven in this one final way. Only the immediate members of the\nKaul family attended the event. Afterward, Hilo stood for a\nlong time staring at the place where three of his brothers were\nburied: Lan, Kehn, and now Tar. Wen stood beside him, not\nmaking a sound, but tears streamed silently down her face, and\nit was only because she was weeping that Hilo was unable to.\nThe sense of grief sitting heavy in his chest was not the\nburning rage that had animated him after Lan’s and Kehn’s\nmurders. Tar’s death felt like the much-delayed end of a\ntragedy that had happened long ago.\nAnden came up on Hilo’s other side and looked down at\nthe casket. His face was drawn with regret, his voice muted\nand uncertain. “I understand if you blame me, Hilo-jen.”\nHilo didn’t reply at first. Then he said quietly, “Tar was the\nbest, the only one who could’ve done it. I don’t blame you any\nmore than I blame myself.” He put a hand on Anden’s\nshoulder and leaned against it heavily, so that he nearly sagged\nagainst his cousin. “I was angry at you for a long time after\nyou refused to wear jade.

The cold in Udain was assaultively dry; Niko’s\nthroat and tongue felt as coarse as sandpaper, no matter how\nmuch ice he sucked on while he waited, and as the sun began\nto set, the temperature dropped even further. The wind picked\nup, stinging his eyes and chafing his face. He could no longer\nfeel his extremities, which was a problem considering that he\nwas counting on his stiffly curled fingers to pull the trigger\nwhen the time came. When he’d been a student at Kaul Du\nAcademy, Niko had gone on training trips into the densely\nforested mountains of Kekon, where it could get cold at night,\nbut never cold like this.\nTo take his mind off the discomfort, he imagined what\nJanloon would be like today. A pleasant day in autumn, the\nsun warm over bustling streets, the slightly sweet, spicy smell\nof the city wafting on the cool breeze coming off the harbor.\nWith the nice weather, his grandmother would be outside\ncleaning up the flower beds. His mother would be\nredecorating. The Pillar would be holding meetings on the\npatio or overseeing the training of Fists on the lawn. Ru would\nbe walking across Jan Royal campus to his next class. Jaya\nwould’ve graduated from the Academy—was she a Finger in\nthe clan now?\nYou chose this, Niko reminded himself. Most of the time,\nwhen he wasn’t freezing and homesick, he was pleased with\nhis life-changing decision. He still had to go where he was\nsent and do what he was told, same as when he’d been a\nFinger, but no one treated him differently because of his name.\nNo one asked for his family’s favor, or expected any greater\nperformance from him than usual. He had the same clothes,\nthe same weapons, the same shitty food as the next guy.\nAnonymity was something he’d never had before, and it was a\nglorious freedom that suited him. He was finally his own man.\nHe’d also seen for himself how much more there was to\nthe world outside of Kekon and the clans. All of Niko’s life,\nthe blood feud between the Mountain and No Peak had\npermeated Kekonese society and every aspect of his existence.\nBeyond the island, however, few people knew about it or\ncared. Most foreigners who wore jade never questioned where\nit came from, just as they never wondered where their food\nwas grown or their clothes were made. The Green Bone clans\nseemed as irrelevant as Jim Sunto said they were—an isolated\ncultural anomaly. This was a revelation to Niko, the sort he’d\nbeen hoping for when he left Janloon. It confirmed suspicions\nhe’d nursed for some time that the clan had given him only a\nnarrow view of reality.\nNext to him, Teije Inno shifted, trying to find a less\nuncomfortable position. Niko had met Teije and a dozen other\nKekonese recruits at GSI’s orientation week at the beginning\nof last year. He’d recognized the man’s name, if not his face.\nEven though the Teijes were relatives of the Kauls and part of\nthe No Peak clan, the families rarely socialized.

In Kekon, the\nstatus difference between Niko and Teije Inno would’ve\nprecluded much of a friendship, but out here they were two\nKekonese away from home and surrounded by foreigners, and\nNiko was grateful for Teije’s presence.\nTeije nudged him and made a small gesture, tapping his\nhead. Perceive that? He jerked his chin toward the left. Niko\ncould not see anything coming down the road. The sky still\nglowed an indigo blue, but under the cover of the pine trees it\nwas already dark. Niko let his vision slide out of focus and\nstretched out his Perception, wishing it was stronger. All he\ncould pick out at first were nearby energies—Teije’s aura right\nnext to him, tiny flickers of rodent life under the snow and\nbirds in the branches, the other two GSI soldiers across the\nroad. After another two seconds of concentration, however, he\nmade out the faint impression of several people, crammed too\nclose together to distinguish their individual energies, but\nrapidly approaching his position. A single vehicle.\nNiko pushed up on his elbows just enough to flash a hand\nsignal toward where Falston and Hicks were concealed. He\nhoped the Espenians saw it through the gloom, or at least\nsensed the alertness in the jade auras of their Kekonese\ncolleagues. Niko wouldn’t say he was friends with the two\nother men, but after three months together in the desolate\ncountryside of Udain, he’d grown accustomed to them. Falston\nwas gruff and cynical, and Hicks was bad-tempered, but they\nwere generally decent and less condescending than other\nforeigners that Niko had interacted with. Ex-military\nEspenians were by far the most numerous group in GSI.\nAlthough they wore the least jade, they were the most\nannoyingly dogmatic about their way of doing things. They\noften lumped the Kekonese, the Keko-Espenians, and the\nKeko-Shotarians together even though the three groups didn’t\nspeak the same language and avoided each other.\nThe vehicle came into sight: a muddy brown four-door\npickup truck with a black tarp over the back, rolling slowly\ndown the singlelane road, its snow tires crunching on the\npacked ice as it made its way toward the town of Hansill—a\nnondescript settlement of two hundred thousand people that\nEspenian intelligence had pinpointed as harboring members of\nan Ygutanian-supported Deliverantist rebellion against the\nautocratic Udaini government.\nNiko squinted down the barrel of his R5. He remembered\nthat Vin Solunu, one of the most senior Fists in No Peak, had\nsuch a precise long-range sense of Perception and\nextraordinary aim that he could shoot a living creature with his\neyes closed from two hundred meters away. Niko had once\nseen him take out a squirrel in a tree while blindfolded. Niko\nhad no such confidence in his own marksmanship, even with a\nnight scope. Changing his mind, he slung the R5 over his\nshoulder and brought his knees and feet up into a crouch,\nmotioning his intentions to Teije."

They breathed in together,\ngathering their jade energy. Falston and Hicks would not do it\nthis way, but Niko and Teije were Kekonese Green Bones, and\nthey did things the Kekonese way—close and personal.\nNiko burst out of his place of concealment. His stiff\nmuscles screamed in protest at the sudden change from\nstillness to explosive motion as Strength poured into his limbs,\nturning him into a blur of speed as he launched himself toward\nthe road, clearing the snow and underbrush in two Light\nbounds.\nHis timing was perfect. As the truck clattered past, Niko\nrammed himself shoulder-first into the passenger side door at\nfull Strength, like a stampeding bull shoving aside an obstacle.\nNo one except a Green Bone with the highest level of Steel\nwould try anything so dangerous. The impact threw Niko clear\nof the road. He flew several meters and tumbled into the trees.\nAs the world upended in his vision, he glimpsed the truck\nswerving wildly as the driver hit the brakes—perhaps thinking\nhe’d hit a deer.\nTeije landed in the road in front of the truck and unleashed\na powerful low Deflection that struck the vehicle’s wobbling\nfront wheels, sending it into a dramatic 360-degree spin before\nit lurched into the nearest snowbank and came to a halt like a\nstuck cow.\nNiko clambered to his feet, his head ringing. His legs went\nwobbly as he let the massive surge of Steel drop from his\nbody, but nothing was broken. His rifle had been tossed into\nthe snow a short distance away upon his landing. He snatched\nit and ran toward the truck, grasping for Lightness to keep\nfrom sinking into the powder, but sprinting low and hunched\nover. Alarm from the people inside spiked in his Perception, a\nsudden eruption of jagged red in his mind. Niko glimpsed the\nman in the driver’s seat raising a shotgun.\nBullets punched through the windshield, flinging the\ndriver’s body backward. Falston and Hicks had reached the\npickup and were releasing concentrated bursts of automatic\nfire that sparked in Niko’s vision like New Year’s firecrackers.\nThe rear door of the truck’s cab opened and a man tumbled\nout, holding a pistol. He took a step and collapsed in the\nmiddle of the road, an unmoving lump on the ice.\nBy the time Niko reached them seconds later, the sharp\nreport of rifle fire was fading through the forest. Spent shell\ncasings littered the ground. “Seer’s balls!” Hicks whooped,\nsmacking Niko on the back. “You crazy fucking keck, you ran\ninto a truck!”\nNiko gasped for breath, his heart still thudding with\nadrenaline and the elation of his own successful daring. A\nvoice in the back of his brain exclaimed: If only the Horn had\nseen that! When he opened his mouth to speak, a noise\nemerged from inside the truck: a highpitched cry of pain."

When he opened his mouth to speak, a noise\nemerged from inside the truck: a highpitched cry of pain.\nThe men froze at the chilling sound. Niko moved first,\npushing past Hicks and approaching the open cab. He saw the\nmiddle-aged driver and another, younger man, both dead,\nsprawled in their winter coats in the front seat. In the back seat\nwas a boy—perhaps twelve, flopped over into the lap of a\nsmaller child, a girl, maybe his sister. Nine or ten years old,\ncovered in blood, but alive and wailing feebly.\n“Fuck the gods,” Teije breathed behind him.\nGSI’s intelligence sources in the Udaini government had\ntold them that their target was an insurgent scouting party, that\nthe men in the truck were the leaders of a radical Deliverantist\ncell. The dead men did not look like trained and hardened\nsoldiers. They looked like ordinary townspeople.\nTeije yanked the tarp off the back of the truck. “There’s\nnothing here.” No weapons, no explosives—just bundles of\nfirewood, a coil of rope, and a red plastic sled.\nNiko could not stop looking at the girl. Her hair was pale\nbeneath a pink wool cap and she had dark freckles. Her mouth\nopened and closed as she stared back at him in confusion and\nterror. He reached into the truck and tried to unbuckle her\nseatbelt, to lift her out.\nFalston seized Niko’s arm. For a second, the man’s\nEspenian words didn’t register with Niko. “We have to get out\nof here,” he said. “Before reinforcements arrive.”\nNiko jerked his arm out of the man’s grip. “There aren’t\nany reinforcements. We fucked up.” Then realizing that in his\nshock and anger, he’d spoken in Kekonese, he said, in rough\nEspenian, “The girl. We have to help her.”\n“You can’t,” Falston said, his voice deadened with\ncertainty. “She’s not going to make it.” The man was right.\nNiko could Perceive the life escaping the child like white\nsmoke spilling into darkness. He pushed the girl’s dead brother\naside and began to Channel into her, but it was like trying to\nkeep water inside a colander. The energy was pouring out in\nmultiple directions and he didn’t have the level of Perception\nand medical training to know where to focus.\nIf only Uncle Anden were here. He’d know what to do. He\ncould save her. He even brought my ma back from the dead.\nThe girl’s chest stopped moving. Niko knew the moment\nhe was Channeling into a corpse—it felt like trying to push his\nown energy into a dry sponge. Her eyes were still open, gazing\nunblinking at nothing.\nNiko turned around. Teije was standing behind him,\nstaring over his shoulder. The man’s fingers were moving\nagitatedly over the jade he wore around his neck. He backed\naway from the expression on Niko’s face. “We couldn’t have\ndone anything,” he said weakly.\nNiko launched himself at Falston. “Why did you fire?” he\nshouted, grabbing the man by his tactical vest. “I stopped the"

Any Finger careless enough to spray gunfire into\ninnocent people would be jade-stripped by his own clan before\nbeing exiled or executed for breaking aisho.\nFalston was a large, strong man. He shoved Niko away,\nhard, sending him stumbling back. Hicks got in between them,\nand Teije grabbed Niko. Jade auras flared, sharp and white\nwith aggression and panic.\n“Get a fucking grip!” Hicks shouted at Niko. “It’s no one’s\nfault, we were doing our jobs. There must’ve been a mix-up,\nwe obviously got some shitty intel, all right?”\nTeije glanced back at the truck and blanched. “Should we\nreport this?” According to GSI’s policies, all noncombatant\ncasualties were supposed to be escalated to an ethics review\ncommittee.\n“Fuck, no,” Hicks exclaimed, aghast at Teije’s question.\n“We’re not soldiers in the ROE military! We’re contractors;\nwe don’t get any government protection. If they decide we\nused inappropriate force, we’re liable.”\n“There are … rules,” Niko choked out. “We have jade and\nthese people don’t.”\n“We also have armored tanks and rocket launchers and\nsatellite imagery,” Hicks retorted. “What’s your point?”\nFalston said with brusque reasonableness, “Listen, if the\nbad guys didn’t hide among civilians, this wouldn’t happen,\nbut sometimes it does. It happened when I was in Oortoko too,\nmore often than I like to think about. You can’t let it eat you\nup, crumb. This is war. The company has to have written\npolicies and shit, for legal reasons, but trust me, no one higher\nup wants us to report this.”\nHicks said, “We eliminated the target, that’s what we\nreport. The three men in the truck probably were Deliverantist\nrebels.” When Niko opened his mouth again, Hicks put his\nface right up to him, so close Niko could smell the man’s\nbreath and see the hairs in his thin nostrils as they flared.\n“Enough, you thick-headed keck. Some crazy shit happened\nand we’re all rattled, but I’m the team leader here, and we’re\ngoing to do what I say. You got a problem with that?”\nNo one had ever spoken to Niko with such aggressive\ndisrespect before and for several seconds, his brain was as\nblank as his face must’ve appeared. Then a number of replies\nsprang to mind—but he didn’t possess a profane enough\nvocabulary in the Espenian language to express any of them.\nHis inarticulate shame felt as hot as a sudden fever.

Niko brought up the rear.\nHe did not look back at the road.\nOnce, when he was a child, Niko had asked his aunt Shae\nwhy she believed in the gods.

She was happy to buy\nnice clothes for her niece. Her efforts to dress up Jaya had\nalways been rejected, resulting in wasted money or ruined\noutfits. Tia, in contrast, was a considerate, artistic child who\nadored animals, sparkly things, dancing, and making up\nstories. It amused Wen to see that as much as Shae loved her\ndaughter, she also seemed bewildered by her, unsure of how\nsuch a dreamy and gentle child had been born into the Kaul\nfamily.\nShae hugged Tia and kissed Woon goodbye, issuing half a\ndozen reminders that her husband accepted with the same\ndiscerning patience with which he’d once handled the Weather\nMan’s affairs on Ship Street and in Wisdom Hall. Watching\nthem, Wen was struck with nostalgia and sadness. Her own\nchildren were grown; even Jaya had left home. Hilo had\nreluctantly agreed to send their daughter to Toshon, in the far\nsouth of the country, where she could get out from under the\nspotlight of being the Pillar’s daughter and be given room to\nprove her prowess as a Green Bone. A long time ago, Wen had\nsecretly hoped to one day have the kind of idyllic\nmotherdaughter relationship that included womanly pastimes\nsuch as going to brunch and the spa, shopping, talking on the\nphone every day. Jaya only called when she needed something,\nusually her father’s advice on dealing with some issue. Wen\nwas begrudgingly proud of her daughter, but she regretted not\nbeing able to relate to Jaya any more than Shae could fully\ncomprehend Tia.\nAlthough she didn’t say it as much as she ought to, Wen\nwas proud of Ru as well, who by all accounts was doing well\nin college. She’d worried so much about her son when he was\nyoung, fearing he would be dismissed and disrespected,\nsaddled by stigma, left with no meaningful prospects—the\ndestiny she surely would’ve faced were it not for marrying\nHilo. But Ru had grown up far differently than she had. He\nwas full of big ideas and confidence, perhaps too much of\nboth. “He talks enough to become the chancellor of the\ncountry. Then we’ll have gold and jade together in one\nfamily,” Hilo said jokingly, though sometimes Wen thought he\nmight believe it.\nAs for Niko … Wen’s heart ached every time she thought\nof him. With her eldest, she felt she’d failed as a mother. She’d\nconvinced Hilo to bring him back to Janloon as a baby, she’d\nraised and loved him as her own son, believing with utmost\ncertainty that he was a fated gift, the gods’ compensation for\nRu inheriting her deficiency. Yet he’d hated the weight of that\nexpectation, had run away from it and taken the family’s hopes\nwith him. Now Wen didn’t even know where he was. Perhaps\nHilo did. She knew her husband had people watching Niko,"

She knew her husband had people watching Niko,\nreporting on his whereabouts, but out of consideration, he\ndidn’t volunteer the information to her unless she asked. She\ndid not ask.\nDuring the three-and-a-half-hour flight, Wen and Shae\nstudied a travel magazine and made plans to go to a Shotarian\nbathhouse and to see a musical at the world famous Leyolo\nCity opera house. It had been some time since the two of them\nhad had the opportunity to spend time together without the\nimmediate demands of family. Wen could see her sister-in-\nlaw’s excitement growing, and when breakfast was served in\nthe business-class cabin, Shae asked Wen, with an\nuncharacteristically sly grin, “It’s not too early in the morning\nto have a cocktail, is it?”\n“Shae-jen,” Wen exclaimed, “I would never gainsay the\nWeather Man’s judgment.” The flight attendant mixed them\nslender glasses of lychee juice and sparkling wine.\n“We’ll have to make dinner reservations for tonight, like\nnormal people,” Shae added with bright anticipation. Even the\nfact that they could not expect to show up and be given\npriority was a novelty to look forward to, one that made the\ntrip seem like an adventure.\nThey were not alone, of course; Wen’s two longtime\nbodyguards, Dudo and Tako, were sitting nearby and would\naccompany Wen wherever she went. The two former Fists\nwere like extended family members to her. She’d gotten to\nknow them well over the years, had met their spouses and\nchildren. The men had become adept at blending into any\nevent that Wen attended, from clan gatherings to public\nappearances and charitable functions.\nAt times, Wen’s days were as busy as her husband’s,\nalthough she tried not to overschedule herself. She needed to\nbear in mind her own physical limitations, and her first\nresponsibility was always to support the Pillar. No other Green\nBone leader had ever made the questionable choice to appoint\nhis own wife as Pillarman. Wen knew the clan’s lukewarm\nacceptance of her unusually elevated position depended on her\nstriking the delicate balance of being active without\noverstepping. She embraced a visible role as wife and hostess,\npromoted causes such as the arts and the environment, and\nraised awareness of nonreactivity and disability. She was\ncareful never to speak publicly about clan affairs nor to draw\nattention to herself in any way that might detract from Hilo’s\nauthority.\nOnly privately within the family did she discuss the\nimportant issues facing No Peak. “Has the Leyolo City office\nhad any trouble from the Mountain or their barukan allies?”\nshe asked Shae.\nHer sister-in-law closed the window shade as they flew\neast into the morning sunlight. “Fortunately, only a little,\nthanks to our relationships with the police.”\nShotarian law enforcement agencies had never had much\nsuccess infiltrating the country’s insular ethnic Kekonese\ncriminal groups. No Peak, however, possessed an effective\nnetwork of White Rats in the Shotarian underworld.

Keko-\nShotarians were an underclass in Shotar—generally\nimpoverished, legally persecuted, accustomed to living in fear\nand treachery. It didn’t take much in the form of bribes or\nthreats to induce them to give up information.\nAlthough No Peak’s overseas spies yielded little truly\nuseful information about the Mountain itself, since Ayt Mada\nwould not be so careless as to share her plans with outsiders, it\noften did reveal the movement of money and people, which\nNo Peak used to its advantage to blunt Ayt’s superior numbers.\nIn an impressive example of cooperation between the military\nand business halves of the clan, this capability had become the\nWeather Man’s weapon in Shotar.\nShae was passing on information from the Horn’s side of\nthe clan about barukan activities—major drug deals, weapons\nsales, prostitution rings, and so on—to Shotarian police\nofficials, who were very willing to secretly accept tips from\nNo Peak spies and receive all the credit from the press, the\ngovernment, and the public for the resulting busts. Of course,\nshe was not giving them this boon for nothing. Business\npermits, working visas, and important meetings were made to\nhappen, and No Peak’s offices received special attention and\nsecurity from the Leyolo City Police Department. The\nexchange had enabled the clan’s expansion into Shotar, and\neven skeptical Hami Tumashon had come around in support of\nthe plan.\nWen lifted her glass to Shae’s. “Who could’ve imagined\nthe irony of a Green Bone clan working with the Shotarian\ngovernment?”\nThey landed in Leyolo City shortly after noon and parted\nways. A prearranged car and driver were waiting to take Shae\ndirectly to the Weather Man’s branch office. Wen waited for\ntheir luggage, which Tako carried out to the parking lot behind\nher while Dudo inspected every inch of the rented black SUV.\nSatisfied with its safety, Wen’s bodyguards drove her to the\nOasis Sulliya, which was not a typical downtown hotel, but a\nresort slightly south of the city, close to the Redwater area that\nwas the heart of the Shotarian film industry.\nWen checked into her room, changed, ordered a light lunch\nfrom the room service menu, and called her husband to let him\nknow she’d arrived. “Leyolo City looks as glamorous as it\ndoes in the movies,” she told him, reaching him in his study\nbetween meetings. On the drive through the city, Wen had\nadmired the capital’s steel spires, which ranked among the\nhighest in the world, its elevated superhighways and high-\nspeed trams, the enormous rotating neon billboards that burned\nwith light even in the middle of the day. So much of Leyolo\nCity had been destroyed in the Many Nations War fifty years\nago that when it was rebuilt, it had burst from the ashes like a\nphoenix. “It’s colder than I expected, though, for springtime.”\n“Don’t spend too much money, unless you’re buying a\ncompany,” Hilo teased.\n“And what if I am?” Wen asked, unable to resist prodding\nhim."

The two of you are a\nbad influence on each other,” he said, in a good-natured way\nthat made light of the past, but was still a stern reminder. No\nsecrets. “I have to go,” he said. “Have a good time. I love\nyou.”\nIn the afternoon, Wen’s bodyguards drove her to the\nheadquarters of Diamond Light Motion Pictures. A translator,\nvetted and hired by the Weather Man’s office, was waiting for\nthem and accompanied Wen as she was received at the\nreception desk and shown into a massive corner office.\nStanding behind the desk was a man wearing tinted, wire-\nrimmed glasses, a soul patch beard, and an expensive blue\nshirt with the sleeves rolled halfway up his thick forearms. He\nwas probably only forty, but bald as an egg. Wen couldn’t\nunderstand the rapid Shotarian he was shouting into a headset,\nbut he was either very excited or verbally tearing apart the\nperson on the other end of the line. Hanging up the call, he\ntossed his headset down and looked over at Wen.\n“Pas Guttano,” said Wen, using the respectful honorific\nand speaking the few formal words she’d carefully rehearsed\nin Shotarian. “It’s my privilege to meet you.” She pressed her\nhands together and touched them to her heart.\nGuttano returned the gesture of greeting, though his\nexpression turned guarded. He gave Wen a tight smile as he\noffered her a seat. “You must be Mrs. Kaul.”\nWen sat down in the comfortable armchair in front of the\nstudio executive’s wide desk. The translator, a prim young\nwoman with long, thin hands, perched alertly in a seat next to\nher. Dudo and Tako stood against the wall by the office door.\nBoth Green Bones were wearing their jade concealed, but\nGuttano studied them with faint unease before turning back to\nWen. “I know who you are,” he told her, “but I can’t think of\nany reason I should be visited by representatives of a Green\nBone clan. Diamond Light doesn’t have any projects currently\nfilming in Kekon.”\nThe translator repeated Guttano’s words back to Wen in\nKekonese. Wen said, “I’m here on behalf of the No Peak clan\nto ask you for a favor. It’s not a small request, and because we\ndon’t know each other, I felt it was important that I come to\nLeyolo City to discuss it with you in person.” She waited for\nthe translator to catch up. “The No Peak clan is a major\ninvestor in Cinema Shore, a Kekonese film studio that’s not\nvery significant in terms of the global movie industry, but is\nthe largest production company we have on our island. It’s\nenjoyed some recent commercial success, most notably a\nseries of action movies starring Danny Sinjo.”\n“The Fast Fists,” Guttano said enthusiastically, sitting\nforward and losing some of his initial reticence. “I’ve seen all\nthree of them! Great entertainment. Second one’s still the best,\nbut I like what they did with Danny’s character in the third\none.”"

Second one’s still the best,\nbut I like what they did with Danny’s character in the third\none.”\n“I’m partial to the first movie myself,” Wen said with a\nsmile. “The Fast Fists series was domestically successful, with\nsteady home video sales in Kekon and abroad. But they were\nmade on a tight budget for the Kekonese audience. Cinema\nShore’s next project is more ambitious. It’s a joint venture with\na major Espenian studio, a big-budget action movie, the first\nKekonese film poised to do well on both sides of the Amaric.\nBut in order for the project to go ahead, it needs Danny Sinjo.”\nGuttano was shaking his head before the translator even\nfinished relaying Wen’s sentence. “I’m sorry, I’ve already\nspoken to Danny’s agent two or three times about this. Danny\nSinjo is under a multiyear contract with Diamond Light, and\nit’s simply not possible for us to release him from that\nobligation. I know Sian Kugo from Cinema Shore and I like\nhim, but he’ll have to find someone else for his project.”\n“Danny Sinjo is the only Kekonese movie star with the\ninternational recognition to carry this film and the only major\nactor with the Green Bone training to pull off the stunts. The\nentire script was written with him in mind as the lead.”\nGuttano opened his hands regretfully. “Then they’ll have\nto rewrite the script. Diamond Light has a filming schedule\nthat’s depending on Sinjo as well.”\nWen folded her hands over her knee and gave the\nShotarian studio executive her most calmly persuasive smile.\n“I completely understand that it’s not in your interest to release\nSinjo from his contract. I’m here to make it in your interest to\ndo so. Whatever you’ve discussed with Sinjo’s agent, set it\naside. No Peak will pay twenty million sepas to Diamond\nLight to release Danny Sinjo from legal obligations to your\nstudio. I understand that is three times what you were planning\nto pay him to play the underboss in the next Streets of Blood\nmovie, which has not yet begun filming. Even accounting for\nthe cost of potential delays and the trouble of finding a new\nactor to play the villain, you have to admit that is a generous\nreimbursement for your loss.”\nGuttano had begun to look supremely uncomfortable. He\nswiveled back and forth in his chair and crossed his arms, still\nshaking his head. “I’m afraid that’s simply not possible,” he\ninsisted again.\nWen felt annoyance rising steadily within her, but she kept\nspeaking in the same convincing tone. She thought of the\ncasual yet intimidating persuasiveness Hilo would have in this\nsituation and tried to project some of her husband’s energy\ninto her words. “Before you refuse so hastily, consider that my\nfamily would remember this favor. My husband is a powerful\nman in Kekon and our clan has strength in many other parts of\nthe world as well. I don’t know how familiar you are with\nKekonese culture, but we take friendship very seriously.\nSuppose you were to need the support of an influential ally at\nsome point in the future—and who doesn’t, especially a man"

Think about how much more valuable that\nwould be to you than the casting of a supporting actor in this\none movie.”\n“Mrs. Kaul, I’m afraid you don’t understand.” Guttano\nbegan to move some items around on his desk in agitation, not\nlooking directly at her, but glancing at the translator and Wen’s\ntwo bodyguards, anywhere except straight at her. “It’s not that\nI’m trying to antagonize you or your husband. If it were\nentirely up to me, I’d be inclined to negotiate with you. But\nit’s not the money that’s the issue. Danny Sinjo made an\nagreement with Diamond Light before this other film was\ngreenlit. He can’t leave Streets of Blood to go work for the\nKekonese, on a project funded by a Green Bone clan. That\nwould … look very bad. It would be unacceptable,\nembarrassing to certain stakeholders of the studio.”\nWen was nearly fed up with the man’s evasiveness. She let\na little of the friendliness slide out of her voice and a strong\nhint of disappointment creep in. “I was under the impression\nthat you were the final authority on these matters, Pas Guttano.\nIf I was misinformed, if there’s someone else in Diamond\nLight I should be speaking to, please let me know, and I’ll\nhave this discussion with them instead.”\nGuttano pushed his chair back as if to create space\nbetween them. “As I’ve said, the money isn’t the main issue.\nThe friendship of the No Peak clan might be valuable in your\nhome country, but it would make enemies in Shotar.” Instead\nof looking at Wen, he looked at the translator and spoke a\nphrase in Shotarian.\nThe young woman hesitated. Wen was surprised. Up until\nthis moment, the translation had been fast and flawless. Wen\nsaid, “What did he say?”\nThe translator said, nervously, “My apologies, Mrs. Kaul,\nI’m not sure how to translate the meaning into Kekonese. In\nShotarian, the words are, ‘Marry the devil, get the devil’s\nmother.’ It means … It’s a saying that’s used to describe an\nagreement or relationship that you can’t escape from.”\nWen sat with this information. “You’re saying he’s already\nmarried the devil.”\n“I think that is what he is trying to say, yes.”\nWen finally understood Guttano’s obstinance. She’d heard\nthat the enormously profitable Shotarian film industry was rife\nwith organized crime involvement. Barukan gangs controlled\nseveral labor unions, bankrolled films, and demanded to be\nconsulted on the glorified portrayal of Keko-Shotarian\ngangsters in pop culture, even going so far as to dictate casting\nchoices. Guttano and Diamond Light Motion Pictures must\nhave ties to people they were unwilling to antagonize.\nShe couldn’t get around this obstacle with money or\ncharm, not if one of the barukan gangs had a hold on Diamond\nLight.

That’s not something I want to do. He’s not a\nman who’s accustomed to being told no, so I don’t know how\nhe’ll react.”\nWen knew exactly how Hilo would react. He would shrug\nand say it was too bad, but that it didn’t really matter—\nCinema Shore had already handsomely returned the\ninvestment she had convinced him and Shae to put into it, and\nthe movie business was just a little piece of No Peak’s vast\nportfolio of tributaries. He would console her by wrapping his\narms around her and saying, that was business, not everything\nwent your way, but had she at least had a nice time in Leyolo\nCity?\nThe Pillar would not send Fists to Shotar to force Guttano\nto comply, to kill him, or destroy Diamond Light, especially\nnot if such a drastic reaction jeopardized the Weather Man’s\nexpansion plans. Any good Green Bone leader knew the\npower of violence and used it without hesitation when called\nfor, but it was a potent tool, not to be flung about carelessly\nover something like a movie star’s contract.\nGuttano, however, did not know this. Shotarians\nstereotyped the Kekonese as vicious and lawless, and jade,\nsome of them believed, was a corrupting substance that\ndrained a portion of a person’s soul every time they used it.\nWen saw fear flicker behind the studio executive’s tinted\nglasses. All he knew about Kaul Hiloshudon was his\nreputation as a man with a great deal of jade and a greater\ncapacity for bloodshed. That was something Wen could use to\nher advantage.\nGenially, she said, “Think about it some more. I’ll be here\nin Leyolo City for a couple more days. You can reach me at\nthe Oasis Sulliya resort if you decide you gave your answer\ntoo hastily.”\nWen turned away. Dudo and Tako moved silently to open\nthe office door. She left the Diamond Light building unhappy,\nbut she hoped her words would sit with Guttano and the\napprehension she’d left him with would motivate him to\nreconsider.\n_______\nShae sighed and kicked off her shoes in the back seat of the\nSUV as Wen’s bodyguards drove them back to the hotel late\nthat evening. “You should come on business trips with me\nmore often,” she sighed to Wen. “We could make a habit out\nof this.” After an excellent meal of oshoys—small plates\nserved alongside poetry—and a production of The Lady’s\nScarf, a romantic musical Shae had first seen in Espenia as a\nuniversity student and which was still enjoyable decades later\neven in Shotarian, she was feeling uncommonly relaxed, clan\nworries pleasantly pushed from her mind.

She seemed preoccupied,\nthough, and the smile slid from her face as she picked at a bit\nof chipped nail polish. “Shaejen,” she said after another\nmoment, “is there anything we can do about the Diamond\nLight situation? Can we find out who’s standing in our way,\nwho Guttano is afraid of?”\nShae rubbed the balls of her feet. “I can try,” she answered\nambivalently. It would be easy to find out the information Wen\nwanted; that was not the problem. “I know this film deal is\nimportant to you,” she said, “but we don’t want to show No\nPeak’s hand in Shotar too strongly.” The Weather Man’s\nbranch office in Shotar was small and Shae was being careful\nto keep it unobtrusive, but the Mountain was surely aware that\nNo Peak was in Leyolo City, and it would be looking for any\nmisstep. Trying to muscle in on the barukan over the film\nindustry seemed risky, even if Shae agreed with her sister-in-\nlaw that they shouldn’t underestimate the power of popular\nculture and entertainment when it came to growing the clan’s\ninfluence. Applications to martial academies and requests for\nclan patronage went up every time one of the Fast Fists movies\ncame out.\nWen drew the silk shawl over her shoulders. “You’re\nright,” she said with resignation. “I think maybe I’ve become\nso invested in this project to prove something to Hilo.” The\nPillar supported his wife’s activities and acknowledged their\nvalue to the clan, but they were side projects, peripheral to No\nPeak’s core concerns of territory, jade, money, and warriors. A\nKekonese film breaking onto the international scene in a major\nway might’ve changed that, and it would’ve been Wen’s\nvictory alone.\nSometimes, when Shae was overwhelmed by the demands\nof being the clan’s Weather Man while also managing life as a\nwife and mother, she considered every obstacle her sister-in-\nlaw had overcome with quiet but immeasurable determination.\nShe was always forced to conclude that in comparison, she had\nno reason to complain and no excuses for failure. “Wen, you\nhave nothing left to prove to anyone.”\nWen gave her a sad smile. “Remember, Shae-jen, most of\nthe clan would say I had only one truly important job.” To give\nthe family an heir. It was no wonder that Wen had taken\nNiko’s departure even harder than Hilo had.\nRed lights pulsed behind the SUV, causing them both to\nturn in their seats. Dudo, who’d just taken the freeway exit\nleading to the hotel, glanced in the rearview mirror at the\nLeyolo City police car behind them. He cursed incredulously.\n“Pull over,” Shae said. “It’s only a Shotarian cop.”\nShae saw his foot hover indecisively between the gas and\nbrake pedals.

Wen looked to\nShae with a question in her eyes.\n“There’s nothing to worry about,” Shae told her. Leyolo\nCity police officers carried only a double-action revolver and a\nbaton. A single policeman would be no threat to one, much\nless three, trained Green Bones. Nevertheless, Dudo’s and\nTako’s jade auras were humming warily, and Tako, in the\npassenger side seat, slid his pistol out of his jacket and tucked\nit out of sight under his leg, within easy reach.\n“Calm down and be respectful,” Shae ordered. Gods forbid\nthe police officer should be unwise enough to try to detain\nthem, or that either of the Fists would give him reason to draw\nhis weapon. None of them knew how to speak much\nShotarian, and the last thing No Peak needed was for a foolish\npolice officer to be accidentally killed by visiting members of\nthe No Peak clan over some misunderstanding.\nDudo rolled down the window. The police officer shone\nthe flashlight into the front seat and asked a question in\nShotarian, which Shae assumed to be a demand for\nidentification. She said to Dudo, “Hand him your driver’s\nlicense and the car rental paperwork.” The policeman swung\nthe flashlight over to Shae’s voice coming from the back seat,\nplaying the bright beam over the two women dressed for the\ntheater—Shae in a short white coat and black skirt, Wen in a\nmaroon dress and silk shawl.\n“We are visitors. We don’t speak Shotarian,” Shae said,\nmaking use of a few phrases she knew in the language. The\nofficer studied Dudo’s Kekonese driver’s license and the\npapers from the car rental company. He returned them and\nstepped back, giving an order in Shotarian and motioning for\nDudo to step out of the car.\n“What the fuck,” Dudo muttered.\nWen said, worriedly, “Maybe he wants to search the car for\ndrugs.”\n“Or weapons. Or jade. Both of which we have,” Tako said.\nIn Janloon, a police officer that stopped a car full of Green\nBones would apologize and send them on their way. If there\nwas some issue with behavior, he would bring it up with the\nHorn. Cops didn’t police the clans. The clans policed the\nclans. Dudo had never in his life obeyed a city police officer\nand didn’t move.\nAny Green Bone of No Peak who traveled on official\nbusiness for the clan was required by the Weather Man’s office\nto sit through an information session explaining what to do in\ncase of a run-in with local law enforcement.

But Wen’s bodyguards were not going to adhere to\nthose edicts if it meant being handcuffed or separated from the\nperson they had sworn to the Pillar to protect with their lives.\nThis unfortunate patrolman would be dead before such a thing\nhappened.\nShae Perceived the police officer’s escalating apprehension\nas he put his hand on his belt, near his pistol. “Do as he says,”\nshe ordered Dudo. “Get out of the car.”\n“Kaul-jen—”\nThe police officer repeated his order in Shotarian, more\ninsistently. His hand moved to the grip of his sidearm, his eyes\ndarting between the occupants of the vehicle. Dudo swore\nunder his breath, opened the door and stepped out. The officer\nmotioned for him to turn around. Dudo did so, placing his\nhands on the side of the SUV. Cars passing them on the road\ncast pulses of light across the scene. Briskly, the cop patted\nDudo down, finding the handgun in his waistband and the\ntalon knife in his shoulder holster and removing them both\nwith a few declarative words in Shotarian that none of them\nunderstood. Dudo didn’t move but Shae could Perceive the\nFist’s jade aura swelling. What if the officer tried to take his\njade as well? Shae’s mind raced, trying to think of a way to\nprevent the situation from escalating.\nTako’s shoulders jerked in alarm. “Something’s not—”\nThree black cars roared up and surrounded the SUV.\nBefore the vehicles had even stopped, masked men were\nspilling out of all the doors. The police officer dropped flat to\nthe ground on his stomach, arms shielding his head, and with a\nflash of dreadful understanding, Shae understood that it had all\nbeen a setup. The sweating cop, if he was a cop at all, had kept\nthem in place, distracted their sense of Perception.\nEven taken by surprise, Dudo and Tako reacted with\nremarkable speed. Dudo hurled a powerful Deflection at the\nmen jumping out of the nearest car, knocking several of them\nto the asphalt. He dropped and scrabbled for his weapons—the\ngun and knife the cop had taken from him—but before he\ncould rise, three assailants set upon him with the startling\nspeed and force that came only from having jade Strength.\nTako leapt out of the passenger side, firing over the hood of\nthe SUV.\nBarukan.

Another two were Deflected wide,\npunching into the sides of the black cars. “Kaul-jen,” Tako\nshouted.\nDudo had killed one of his assailants, who lay in the street\nwith his neck obviously broken. Another was rolling on the\nground, clutching his leg and moaning in agony. A man with a\nsteel pipe smashed Dudo across his broad shoulders, and then\nsquare in the back of the head. The Green Bone’s Steel\nprevented his skull from being split open but he collapsed to\nthe ground, limp.\nAdrenaline and rage flooded into Shae’s brain. She could\nnot believe this was happening. A part of her mind expected\nmore No Peak Fists to appear at any second, to fly to their\nprotection and slaughter these men. But this was not Janloon.\nThese barukan thugs were crude and clumsy in their attacks.\nTheir jade auras, burning with violent excitement, were as\nwild and uneven as those of untrained teenagers—but there\nwere over a dozen of them.\nShae launched herself out of the car with a cry and felt a\nrush of fevered satisfaction when her Strength carried her to\nthe nearest barukan in a second and her talon knife plunged\ninto the side of his neck. The man’s eyes were the only part of\nhis face visible; they flew wide with shock. For a second, Shae\nfelt only astonishment. It had been years—more than a decade\n—since she’d drawn her knife to kill an enemy and she was\ndisoriented by the moment, by the blood and the Perception of\nthe man’s pain. Then instinct took over; she ripped the talon\nknife straight across with a surge of Strength, severing the\ncarotid artery. “Get Wen out of here,” she shouted at Tako.\nAnother man grabbed Shae from behind. She twisted and\nsent a spear of Channeling into his chest. She could tell\nimmediately that the strike was nowhere near strong or precise\nenough. That one kill had been a lucky thing. Shae was a\nGreen Bone twenty years past her fighting prime. She didn’t\nhave enough jade, she was too old and too slow. The\nChanneling strike meant to burst the man’s heart only made\nhim gasp and cough violently.\nAt least he lost his grip on her. Shae tore away from him,\nsharp pebbles digging into the soles of her feet as she backed\nup with her talon knife extended. Other men came toward her,\nemboldened by her failure.\nTako was still firing his gun and throwing Deflections\nfrom behind the cover of the SUV and protecting Wen with his\nlife. Shae thought she heard her sister-in-law screaming her\nname, but if so, the gunfire and the roaring of blood in her ears\ndrowned it out. She glimpsed Tako’s face, twisted with frantic\nuncertainty. Dudo was unconscious, and Shae was too far\naway for him to help her without exposing Wen. Abandoning\nthe Weather Man was unthinkable, but his first duty was to\nprotect the Pillar’s wife.

Lifting Wen, crying and protesting in his arms, he\nran.\nThe SUV was penned in, but a steep ravine dropped off\nfrom the side of the road. Even weighed down with Wen\nclinging to him, Tako cleared the gully in a single Light\nbound. Half a dozen masked men gave chase, leaping after\nhim and firing at his fleeing figure, gaining quickly as he\nstruggled to keep sprinting with Wen in his arms. Tako set\nWen down on her feet and they ran, the Fist urging her along\nahead of him.\nShae tried to follow. As if sucking in a breath with her\nwhole body, she gathered her jade energy and leapt Light over\nthose in her way. In three more steps, she reached the edge of\nthe ravine and stumbled to a horrified halt as another gunshot\nrang out and she saw Tako go down. He scrambled up again,\nbut Wen had spun around and run back toward him. Shae let\nout a guttural scream of denial as one of the masked men\nreached and seized Wen, pinning her arms, and from a distance\ntoo close to Deflect, another barukan unloaded two bullets into\nTako’s torso. Even from a distance, Shae Perceived the\nbodyguard’s blinding red agony as he folded at the waist and\ncollapsed into the brittle grass.\nShae turned. Four masked men with guns stood behind her,\nfour across the ravine around Wen and Tako. The man with his\narm around Wen’s throat walked back toward her, forcing Wen\nto stumble along in front of him. Shae could see the whites of\nher sister-in-law’s eyes, glistening with tears of fear and rage.\nThe man called out to Shae, in accented Kekonese, “Kaul\nShaelinsan! You think you’re one tough Janloon bitch. We’ll\nsee how tough. Do you think you can move faster than the\nbullet of this gun?” He pressed the barrel of his weapon to\nWen’s temple.\nShae said, “If you pull the trigger, every single one of you\nwill die.” She was thankful her voice did not come out\ntrembling, but it seemed to her that the world was tilting under\nher feet. These men knew who she was. They surely knew\nwho Wen was as well. They’d gone to the effort of setting up\nthe ruse with the police officer and they’d attacked with\noverwhelming force, clearly prepared to suffer casualties.\nThey already expected death, so her threats were not going to\nmake any difference.\n“Drop the knife,” the man called. “Then take off your\njade.”\nIf it had been only her own safety in question, under no\ncircumstances would Shae allow herself to be disarmed and\nfor her jade to be taken. Even outnumbered, she would’ve\nturned and fought until she was killed or subdued—which was\nsure to happen, seeing as how Dudo and Tako, trained Fists\nmuch younger than her, had been overpowered. But that would\nmean leaving Wen to the mercy of their enemies, which she\ncould not do. The barukan hadn’t fired on the women. They\nwanted them alive.\nWhich meant they wanted something from No Peak."

She willed her fingers not to shake as she removed her\nearrings and bracelets. A sick sense of degradation crawled up\nher throat and made her face burn with shame and disgust. She\nfelt as violated as if she were being forced to strip naked\nbefore her assailants. When she’d removed her jade, the man\nsaid, “Set it down on the ground and walk backward.”\nShae’s hands closed tight around her jade. It won’t get you\nout of this, she told herself. It won’t help Wen, either. She bent\nher knees and dropped the gems on the ground in front of her.\nThe first disorienting jolt of withdrawal hit a couple of\nseconds later. Shae curled her hands in the folds of her skirt.\nShe swayed, light-headed. A layer of gauze seemed to fall\nover her eyes and ears and turn the night even more surreal.\nSlowly, she stood up and took two steps back. Rough\nhands came down on her shoulders and forced her down to her\nknees, scraping her skin against asphalt. Shae caught a glimpse\nof Wen’s terrified face, trying to say something—and then the\nblack hood went over Shae’s head, her wrists were bound\nbehind her back, and she was half pushed, half dragged into a\ncar that began to move.\n_______\nHilo was in the training hall with his eighteen-year-old\nnephew, Maik Cam, when the housekeeper, Sulima, ran up\nfrom the main house and slid the door open without knocking.\n“Forgive me, Kauljen,” she panted, her face pale with alarm,\n“but someone … On the phone …”\nThe Pillar strode through the dark courtyard into the main\nhouse and picked up the phone in the study, hitting the button\nfor the main line. An accented voice said, “Kaul Hiloshudon.\nIf you wanted to invade Shotar, you should’ve come yourself\ninstead of sending your bitches. You’re used to being in\ncharge, but from this moment on, you’re not in charge\nanymore. If you want your wife and your sister returned alive\nand intact, you’ll do exactly as we say.” Silence. “Are you\nlistening carefully, Kaul Hilo?”\n“Yes,” Hilo said. “Prove they’re alive and unharmed.”\nA rustle of movement in the background as the phone was\nhanded off. There was a considerable amount of static\ninterference, as if the connection was bad. Hilo’s heart\nstuttered as Wen’s voice came onto the line, hoarse and\nfrightened. “Hilo?”\nHe managed to keep his own voice unchanged. “Have they\nhurt you?”\n“No,” she said weakly.\n“And Shae?”\n“They took her jade, but she’s not hurt. Dudo and Tako are\nbadly injured.”\n“Stay calm,” Hilo said. “I’ll solve this.”\n“Hilo, I—”\nThe phone was snatched away and the kidnapper’s voice\nreturned. “You have the proof you asked for.

If this\ntransaction goes smoothly, you’ll have seven days to shut\ndown the operations you set up in Leyolo City, remove every\nsingle member of your clan from our country, and publicly\nannounce that No Peak will make no further attempts, now or\nin the future, to enter Shotar. Then, and only then, will you get\nyour sister back, along with your two men if they are still\nalive.”\n“I’ll do as you say,” Hilo replied. “You’ll get the money\nand the jade you want. I’ll pull No Peak out of Shotar. I can\noverlook losing material things. If you harm the people I care\nabout, however, that is a very different matter.” A fever was\nengulfing his brain. He felt as if the edges of his vision were\nclosing in. All the most terrible possibilities he could imagine\nwere crashing against a bulwark of consuming rage.\nWhat he said next would have to be perfect. He could be\nneither defiant nor meek. If he was too aggressive, they would\nabandon their plans and kill their captives. If he sounded\ndesperate, they would not fear him enough to commit to their\nend of the bargain. This damning calculation happened\nwithout conscious thought.\nHilo said, quietly, “You’re obviously thick-blooded,\nwhoever you are, since you’re willing to do things even my\nworst enemies would not. I’ve led dangerous operations\nbefore, so let me tell you something: I’m not the one you have\nto worry about now. I’ll be as cooperative as a baby goat.

She pulled her knees close\nto her body and tried to take long, deep breaths, picturing\nherself in the garden back home, sitting by the pond amid\nblooming magnolia and honeysuckle. She told herself this was\nnot like the situation she’d been through with the Crews. If it\nwas, she would already be raped or dead. These men wanted\nsomething from her husband, otherwise they wouldn’t have\nput her on the phone with him for those two seconds. Hilo\nwould move Heaven itself. He would bring down the full\nmight of the clan to find her and get her out safely. In the\nmeantime, she had to stay calm as he’d instructed, to think\nclearly and not surrender to blind terror.\nThat was a difficult task when she could hear Tako\nmoaning in pain somewhere down the hall. The Fist had been\nshot multiple times while trying to defend her. Steel could not\nstop bullets, but it could slow their passage through the body,\nwhich would’ve only increased Tako’s suffering. Wen hated to\nhear the sounds, but at least she knew he was still alive. She\nhad neither seen nor heard any sign of Shae since the barukan\nhad stripped her of jade and pushed her into one of the other\ncars.\nWen rested her head against the wall and closed her eyes.\nShe didn’t sleep, but she drifted in and out of exhausted\nsemiconsciousness until cracks of light began seeping in from\naround the black plastic taped over the window. The door\nopened, and a man came in with a plastic tray of food and\npaper cup of water. He cut the tape around her wrists with a\npocketknife and stood over her as she ate. It was a limp meal\nof instant rice and reheated frozen vegetables. Wen had no\nappetite, but she ate the food; she needed to keep up her\nstrength. The irony that she’d been dining with Shae in a five-\nstar restaurant the previous evening almost made her want to\nlaugh.\nWhen she was done, the guard motioned for her to put her\nwrists together so he could bind her again. Wen said, “I need\nto go to the bathroom.” The man hesitated. He was young, no\nolder than Wen’s own sons, with an indecipherable tattoo on\nthe side of his neck and the faintly hostile look of a nervous\ndog unsure of its place in the pack. Last night, his boss had\nposted him in the hallway, pointed at Wen, and issued orders\nin a tone that suggested the young man was responsible for\nher, and that he would deeply regret it if he failed. “Please,”\nWen said. “The bathroom.”\nThe young man—she decided to call him Junior—escorted"

Along the way, she\npassed an open doorway and saw Tako lying on top of a\nplastic sheet in a caked pool of his own blood, curled around\nhis stomach wound. His eyes were closed and his face moved\nin pain with every shallow breath. As the hours passed, his\nmoans had grown weaker but more continuous. His fingers\nand neck were bare. Even in his helpless state, the barukan had\ntaken his jade.\nWen tried to go to him, but Junior didn’t let her; he\nprodded her straight toward the bathroom and only allowed\nher to close the door partway while she relieved herself. Wen’s\nmaroon dress, which she had bought only yesterday at one of\nthe trendy shops in the Redwater area, was torn at the shoulder\nand the hem. At the sink, she splashed cold water on her face,\ntrying to shock herself back into alertness.\nOn the return trip down the hallway, she stopped in the\ndoorway next to Tako and faced Junior, staring him in the face.\n“You can’t leave him like that,” she insisted.\nJunior grabbed her arm and began to pull her back toward\nher room. Wen clung to the door frame, struggling and\nshouting that she wouldn’t go until they treated Tako’s\nwounds. Junior became agitated. “Bitch,” he hissed as he pried\nher fingers loose, breaking two of the nails. Two other barukan\nshowed up to see what the problem was. One of them was the\nleader who’d made the call to Hilo and put her on the phone\nlast night—a wiry, unexpectedly short man in camouflage\ncargo pants, a black T-shirt, and a carved skull pendant of\nbluffer’s jade around his neck. Physically, he didn’t seem that\nformidable at first glance, but the jade rings on his fingers\nwere real, and he had a pinched, ferocious face with\nprotruding eyes and a feral stare. Wen thought of him as Big\nDog.\n“What the fuck is going on here?” Big Dog snapped at\nJunior, who began to defend himself in Shotarian. The barukan\nreadily mixed the languages when they spoke.\nWen interrupted and addressed the leader directly. “That\ninjured man is a Fist of No Peak,” she reminded him. “He’s no\ngood to you as ransom if he dies. You have to help him. Call a\ndoctor. My husband will be more forgiving toward you if you\ndo.”\nBig Dog sneered. “You think you can still order people\naround like a queen?”\n“She’s right,” said the mixed-blood man with the jade nose\nring who seemed to be the second-in-command. “We have to\ndo something about that gods-awful moaning.”\nBig Dog drew his pistol and before Wen could even\nscream, he shot Tako in the head, silencing him. “Took care of\nit,” he said. Second Dog let out a startled burst of laughter, but\nJunior turned pale. Wen’s vision blurred. Tako had been her\nbodyguard for years. He had a wife and two daughters.

They\nhad never meant to let Tako live. They’d only let him suffer.\n“You … you… . dogs,” Wen whispered. “Tako was … was\na friend … of m-my family.” It had taken years of effort to\nrecover her ability to speak smoothly, but now stress and\nemotion made words stick in her throat again. She hated the\nsound of her renewed weakness when she most needed to be\nstrong against these animals. “You’re … all … dead men.”\nBig Dog backed her against the wall, putting his brutal\nface close to hers. Wen flinched at the menace in his eyes. “Do\nyou think we’re afraid of your husband? Just because you’re\nused to everyone bowing and scraping to him, you think it’s\nbecause of his threats that we’re treating you so nicely? He’s\npowerless here. He can’t find us and he can’t touch us. Think\nabout that before you decide to open your mouth again.”\nSecond Dog and Junior dragged her back into the room\nand shut the door.\n_______\nThe Kaul house was a war room. Multiple phones and\ncomputers were set up in the Pillar’s study. Lott and Hejo had\nthe clan’s tech wizards trying to trace the location of the\nransom call. The perpetrators weren’t careless; Hejo’s analysts\nsuspected they’d attached a moving cellular phone to a two-\nway radio, so there was no way to pinpoint where the call had\ncome from. All they could say confidently was that it had\noriginated in Leyolo City, so Wen and Shae had not been\ntransported far.\nFederal police might have superior technology to narrow\nthe search further, but Hilo quickly decided against involving\neither the Kekonese or Shotarian authorities. He could not risk\nLeyolo City cops getting involved and putting Wen and Shae\nin greater danger, and he wished to prevent, or at least delay\nfor as long as possible, word getting out that the Pillarman and\nWeather Man of No Peak were being held hostage by lowly\nforeign criminals. Already, whispers of concern were\ncirculating in the clan over the Pillar’s abruptly canceled\nappointments.\nHilo wanted to get on a plane with an army of the clan’s\nbest Fists and go to Leyolo City himself. He would make it\nknown that he was on the hunt. He would offer a staggering\nreward for anyone who led them to the kidnappers, and he\nwould spread the word that if Shae and Wen were not returned\nsafely within twenty-four hours, he would tear the city apart,\nkill every barukan member he could get his hands on until he\nfound the men who’d done this, and they and their families\nwould all die.\nHe voiced this sentiment to Lott, who said, with some\nworry, “Kaul-jen, of course, every Fist and Finger is willing to\nfollow you and give our lives if it would bring Shae-jen and\nWen back, but I’m not sure that’s the best way to—”\n“I know that,” Hilo snapped.

He didn’t\ncontrol the streets, the police, the government, or the people.\nWen and Shae would be dead as soon as the barukan found out\nhe was in the country, and those responsible would flee,\nknowing he couldn’t easily find them.\nAlthough he was too sick with worry to sleep, he was also\nbored. After issuing orders, there wasn’t much he could do\nwhile he waited for more information. He’d already instructed\nJaya not to come up to Janloon straightaway, but to stay calm\nand remain at her home in Toshon until they knew more. He\nwas finding it hard to do likewise. Lott told him politely but\nfirmly that his constant pacing and the stress in his jade aura\nwere distracting, so Hilo went out onto the patio and smoked,\nquitting be damned.\nIn the morning, word came from one of the clan’s secret\ncontacts in the Leyolo City police that the black SUV Tako\nand Dudo had rented had been found seemingly abandoned on\nthe side of the road five kilometers from the hotel. There were\nno skid marks, no signs of a car chase or collision, and no\nsigns of mechanical failure. If they’d known they were being\nfollowed, Wen’s bodyguards would’ve driven to a safer, more\ndefensible place. The only plausible explanation for them to be\ncalmly stopped in a random location was that they’d been\npulled over. If the kidnappers had fake or real Leyolo City\npolice in their employ, they were expert criminals.\n“It wasn’t the Matyos,” Lott reported, getting off the\nphone. None of the clan’s White Rats embedded in the largest\nof Shotar’s barukan gangs had any knowledge of the\nabduction. If the Matyos were responsible, there would’ve\nbeen some leakage within the gang. People would know\nsomething big was going on. Arrangements would’ve been\nmade, safe houses secured, gunmen organized. Either the\nMatyos were not involved or it was an outsourced job, known\nonly to the highest-level leaders. Given how quickly the\noperation had been put together, that seemed unlikely.\nIf the Matyos weren’t behind this, Ayt Mada most likely\nwasn’t either. Hilo was almost disappointed, even though he\nknew his oldest and greatest rival had no reasonable motive\nfor a crude ransom kidnapping with such high odds of being\nbotched. But if the clan’s usual enemies weren’t to blame, then\nwho was? The answer came a few hours later. Members of the\nclan in the Leyolo City branch office had examined all of\nShae’s and Wen’s activities since the instant they arrived in\nShotar. After they accounted for everyone Shae had met that\nday, suspicion fell on Wen’s meeting at Diamond Light.\nHami Tumashon, who was on the ground in Shotar, took\ntwo of the clan’s Fingers from the Leyolo City branch office\nand drove to Guttano’s home.

After Wen had come to\nhis office to demand the release of Danny Sinjo from his\ncontract, Guttano feared for his life. He’d phoned a barukan\nboss named Choyulo to plead for protection, revealing that the\nwife of Kaul Hiloshudon had visited him and that she was\nstaying at the Oasis Sulliya resort.\nHami explained over the phone that Choyulo was a\nmember of the Faltas barukan. The Faltas were a smaller gang\nthan the Matyos, although the two organizations maintained an\narm’s-length alliance. The Faltas acted as muscle for the larger\ngang but were also known for their own activities, primarily\nextortion and corporate kidnappings. They had tentacles into\nthe sports, music, and film industries, and most of the\nShotarian gangster films that glorified the barukan were about\nthe Faltas.\n“What should I do with Guttano?” Hami asked.

In any case, we may need to ask him other things\nabout the Faltas.”\nHilo took the line off mute and gave instructions to Hami.\n“Put Guttano up in a hotel. Have him phone his wife and tell\nher that he’s been called out of town on urgent business. A\nproblem on a film set, something like that. Post guards to\nmake sure he doesn’t talk to anyone else and doesn’t leave. If\nwe get Wen and Shae back safely, he goes free. If we don’t,\nhe’s dead. So if there’s anything else he can tell us about the\nFaltas, he should do it, if he wants to see his family again.”\nHilo fell into an armchair and longed for another cigarette.\nWoon Papidonwa was sitting in the chair across from him with\nhis head in his hands, looking wretched. Hilo wished the man\nwould go back to his own house, as there wasn’t anything\nWoon could do here, but he wasn’t cruel enough to send\nShae’s husband out of the room.\n“I should’ve gone with her,” Woon lamented in a whisper.\nHilo berated him more harshly than he deserved. “If you\nhad, Tia would be in danger of losing both parents instead of\none. You think you could’ve changed anything?”\nNevertheless, Hilo understood deeply how difficult it was for a\njade warrior to accept that there came a time when he couldn’t\nfight his own battles anymore, couldn’t with his own strength\nand abilities protect those he loved. “Shae is smart enough to\nstay alive until we figure out a way to get her and Wen back,\nand we’re already doing everything we can,” he told Woon\nmore gently.\n“What can I do to help, Kaul-jen?” his brother-in-law\nbegged.\n“You can take care of your daughter,” Hilo replied,"

Tia was clearly aware that something was\nwrong. As Woon would not leave the war room, Anden had\ndriven the girl to school that morning and picked her up again\nin the afternoon. Now Tia was worriedly tugging on her\nfather’s arm every few minutes to ask when they were going\nhome, and why there were so many people in Uncle Hilo’s\nhouse.\nWoon hugged his daughter but couldn’t bring himself to\ntell her the truth. He said, “Why don’t you finish your snack\nand then go over to your grandma’s house.”\nTia ran out of the room after her uncle. “Something bad\nhas happened, hasn’t it?”\nHilo squatted down next to his niece but hesitated to\nanswer. He didn’t believe in lying to children and had never\nshielded his own from reality. But Tia was different. “Yes,” he\nsaid. “We’re going to fix it, so I don’t want you to be\nfrightened.”\n“Is it about my ma?” When Hilo nodded, Tia’s eyes welled\nwith fear. “I want to know.”\n“Some very bad people took your ma, and your aunt Wen,\nand two of our Fists while they were on their trip to Leyolo\nCity. They want some things from our clan—jade, money,\nother important things—before they’ll give them back.”\nTears spilled down Tia’s face as she clutched Hilo’s arm.\n“Uncle Hilo, you have to get my ma back, no matter what. Just\ngive them whatever they want!”\n“I’ll do everything I can, Tia-se, I swear it,” Hilo\npromised. “But our family has terrible enemies, and\nsometimes what they want most of all is to hurt us.”\n“Why would anyone hate us so much?” Tia wept. “None\nof this makes sense!”\nRu had walked through the door only a few minutes\nearlier, having skipped the day’s classes to rush back home.\nEveryone could hear Koko leaping about and barking with\nexcitement despite his age. Ru came over and crouched down.\n“Tia, all the grown-ups are busy right now and we shouldn’t\ndistract them. Your ma would want you to be strong and to let\neveryone work so they can find her and bring her home.” As\nfrightened as he was for his own mother, Ru spoke to his little\ncousin as if everything would be fine. “Why don’t the two of\nus go into the other room and play video games? I’ll show you\na new one I got last week.” He took the girl’s hand in his own.\n“Thank you, son.” Hilo put a hand on Ru’s shoulder,\ngrateful to have one of his children near home who he could\ncount on. Since going to college, Ru had become even more\nexpressive and opinionated. He’d dyed copper highlights into\nhis hair and was wearing a T-shirt that read I’m Nonreactive to\nBullshit.

He was often bringing up this or that charity or social\ncause that he thought No Peak should be supporting, but he\nwas also a great help to his parents.\nThe afternoon light was starting to wane, and Hilo hadn’t\nslept since the night before last. Wen and Shae had been in\nbarukan hands for eighteen hours. Two million thalirs in cash\nhad been procured from the clan’s accounts and forty\nkilograms of jade taken from its vaults. Locked in four steel\nbriefcases, they were now being loaded onto a chartered plane.\nIn three and a half hours, a small team of the clan’s most\ntrusted Fists would arrive in Leyolo City with the money and\njade. In eight hours, they would make the planned handover\nwith the Faltas.\nEight hours. They would be the longest of his life. In eight\nhours, Wen might be safe, or he might be searching for her\nbody.\nHilo did not share Shae’s stalwart belief in the gods, but he\nwas not above praying. All his power as Pillar of a great Green\nBone clan could not guarantee him anything in this moment\nother than the promise of vengeance, and that was far less\ncomfort to him than it had once been.\nCHAPTER\n46\nValuable Things\nW\nen sat with her ear pressed against the door, listening to\nthe men speaking in the hallway. She could hear Junior’s\nworried voice, although she couldn’t make out the words, and\nthen Second Dog’s sharp response, “Of course she knows!\nAfter tonight, we’ll have time. Stick with the plan and we\nwon’t have to worry about the Matyos.”\nTheir footsteps approached. Wen scrambled away from the\ndoor and slumped back to the floor in the corner, closing her\neyes and feigning sleep. The door opened, spilling light from\nthe hall across her face. “Get up,” Second Dog ordered.\nWen sat up slowly, not even needing to pretend to be\ngroggy. Junior came toward her with a cloth sack and she\nshrank back in renewed fear. “I … can’t … breathe in that. Just\nblindfold me. Please.” She hated the way she sounded, but\nJunior relented. He folded the cloth up and tightened it around\nher eyes, leaving her nose and mouth uncovered. They pulled\nher to her feet and told her to walk. Already weakened and\nwithout her sense of sight, her painstakingly reacquired sense\nof balance failed her. She swayed and stumbled, bumping\nagainst the wall. “What’s wrong with you?” Second Dog\ndemanded. The two men took her elbows and led her through\nthe house like a hobbled ewe. A door opened. For a blissful\nfew seconds, cool night air slapped against her face. Then she\nwas steered into the back of a car and shut inside.\nThe vehicle was full. Two men on either side of her\npenned her into the middle back seat. She heard Second Dog\nspeak from the front passenger seat. “Let’s go. We have to get\nthis done.” The driver started the car and it began to move.\nWen clenched her trembling hands together and pressed\nthem between her knees. She was afraid but no longer"

        "text": "this done.” The driver started the car and it began to move.\nWen clenched her trembling hands together and pressed\nthem between her knees. She was afraid but no longer\npanicked. She had been killed before. By all rights, she ought\nto have died in Port Massy eighteen years ago. Instead, she’d\nbeen given the chance to see her children grow up and to\nspend more years with Hilo, some of which had been difficult,\nbut many of which had been happy. She’d overcome her\ninjuries to stand in front of crowds of people and dozens of\ncameras to speak for the clan. She was the only wife of a Pillar\nto also be Pillarman. So she had no regrets about how she’d\nspent the gift of extra time in her life, and she promised herself\nthat at least she would not beg, no matter what they did to her.\nShe was, however, desperately worried about Shae and Dudo.\n“Where’s Kaul Shae?” she asked. “What are you going to\ndo with her?”\nThey did not answer her. The drive lasted for a long time,\nperhaps an hour, although Wen couldn’t be sure. At last, the\ncar stopped. The men inside conversed in Shotarian. Two of\nthem—Second Dog and the man on her left side—exited the\ncar while the others waited behind. Long minutes passed,\nduring which Wen wondered where they had gone, whether\nthey were digging a shallow grave for her body.\nA two-way radio crackled to life from the driver’s seat.\nAnother curt conversation was exchanged over the radio, and\nthen the barukan on Wen’s right side opened the door and\nexited the car. “Get out,” he ordered. She recognized Junior’s\nvoice. Wen put her feet down firmly, holding on to the side of\nthe car as she stood. She heard and smelled water, then the\nblindfold was pulled off her head, and she saw that they were\non one end of a fog-obscured bridge spanning the Gondi River.\nJunior cut the tape around her wrists, then pointed her toward\nthe bridge’s pedestrian path. “Walk,” he ordered, and prodded\nher forward.\nWen began to cross the bridge, Junior walking behind her.\nThe cold, damp air filled her needy lungs. The fog thickened\nas they went farther out onto the water. Wen couldn’t see the\nend of the bridge; its silver girders disappeared into white\nmist. A few cars passed on the road in either direction, their\nlights smearing the pavement before disappearing, but the\npedestrian walkway seemed entirely deserted. Wen hung on to\nthe railing to steady her steps, but she regretted glancing over\nthe side. It was a long drop to the dark, fast-moving water\nbelow.\n“Stop,” Junior said. “Don’t move.” Wen heard him draw\nhis pistol and then she felt the cold metal barrel of the weapon\ntouch the back of her head. She remained motionless and kept\nher eyes open. She knew better than to expect her life to flash\nbefore her eyes. That was a myth. When death came, it was\nwith terror and pain and nothing else.\n“Is it your job to kill me, to prove yourself to the others?”\nshe asked Junior. When the young man didn’t answer, she said,\n“Do you really want to be a part of such evil?”"

When the young man didn’t answer, she said,\n“Do you really want to be a part of such evil?”\n“Shut up,” Junior whispered, but Wen heard the hint of\ndoubt in his voice. “You don’t get to talk about evil. We’re the\nones minding our own business, but the clans have to come in\nwhere you’re not welcome and fuck over everyone who\ndoesn’t bow to you. If it were up to me,” Junior hissed\nfiercely, “I’d kill every last member of your family.”\nWen had enough experience with teenage sons to know\nthat young men often didn’t know their own feelings, even\nwhen they insisted they did. She could feel the gun shaking a\nlittle behind her head. “Then what are we waiting for?”\nTwo figures appeared on the pathway, walking quickly\ntoward them. As they neared, Wen saw that it was Second Dog\nand the other barukan who’d left the car earlier. They were\neach carrying two metal cases, their arms tensed with Strength.\nThey strode past Wen and Junior with barely a glance. Wen\ndidn’t dare to turn, but she heard the trunk of the car opening\nbehind her and the heavy thud of the suitcases being placed\ninside. “You’re the lucky one tonight, you cunt,” Junior said.\nThe gun came away from her head. Wen’s heart began to beat\nagain. “Keep walking.”\nWen took a step forward and then another. She kept\nwalking, faster and faster when she realized that the barukan\nwere not following. She was stumbling now, using the damp\nmetal railing to pull herself along. At first, there was nothing\nahead but fog, then shapes resolved out of the gloom. Two\nmen. Another few steps, and she recognized her nephew, Cam,\nstanding with Hami Tumashon.\nWith a choked cry, Wen ran toward them. Cam ran to her\nand caught her up, hugging her tight. “Aunt Wen, thank the\ngods,” he said, his voice catching. Hami threw his jacket over\nher bare shoulders, and the two of them led her, shaking with\nrelief, to the other side of the bridge, where a car waited. Vin,\none the clan’s First Fists, was behind the wheel, and as soon as\nthey were all inside, he began to drive. Cam sat in the back\nwith Wen, putting a hot thermos in her hands and warm\nblankets on her until her violent trembling abated. “We’ll be at\nthe airstrip in twenty minutes,” Hami assured her.\nWen felt her wits slowly coming back together. “What\nabout Shae?”\nShe saw the line of Hami’s jaw tighten. “They still have\nher,” he said. “They demanded money and jade for your\nrelease. They say they’ll release the Weather Man once we\ndismantle No Peak’s office and evacuate Shotar completely.”\n“How much longer will that be?”\n“A week,” Hami said, glancing over his shoulder at her.\n“It’ll hurt our business badly, to tear up everything we’ve done\nhere in the past year, but it’s what we have to do for now to\nmeet their demands.

The words that Wen had overheard in the hallway\nearlier in the night came back to her. She hadn’t known what\nthey were talking about. After tonight, we’ll have time. Wen\nlurched forward and grabbed Hami’s shoulder. “We can’t get\nonto the plane yet,” she cried. “We have to stop and phone\nHilo.”\n“Don’t worry, I had Fists watching the bridge,” Vin told\nher. “They’re phoning the Pillar now to let him know the\nhandoff went smoothly and that you’re safe.”\nCam said, “Hopefully that means we’ll get the others back\nsafely too.”\nWen shook her head vigorously. She’d gotten off too\neasily. Those men—Big Dog, Second Dog, even Junior—\nshe’d seen their reckless hatred. They would’ve been pleased\nto send Hilo her violated corpse. Only some truly compelling\nreason would’ve motivated them to release her unharmed.\nThey didn’t fear No Peak’s vengeance, so that wasn’t the\nreason. She hadn’t heard them crowing with anticipation over\nthe money or jade.\nNo, delivering a hostage right away in exchange for\nransom was a sign of cooperation. A misdirection, meant to\nlull the Pillar into withdrawing his people in the belief that the\nkidnappers were sincere in their demands. “I have to talk to\nHilo myself,” Wen insisted, growing frantic. “We can’t believe\nthem. We shouldn’t pull anyone out. We need everyone we\nhave in this country searching for Shae, because they’re not\ngoing to give her back.”\n_______\nShae had reviewed the possibility of escape and determined it\nto be minimal. Without any of her jade, she had no hope of\noverpowering her barukan captors, even if she wasn’t tied to a\nchair, gagged, and suffering from jade withdrawal. She’d been\nthrough jade withdrawal twice before in her life, and it had\nbeen unpleasant, but she’d been cared for or able to care for\nherself, not bound and starved by enemies. A relentless\nheadache sat at the front of her skull, hammering into the\nbacks of her eyeballs, and her face and neck were filmed with\na layer of sweat that made her shiver with chills. For some\nreason, she found herself thinking of Yun Dorupon, a man\nshe’d despised and who was long dead, but with whom she felt\na sudden miserable kinship, because as Weather Man, he had\nonce been captured by Shotarians, jade-stripped, and tortured.\nAt some point, she thought she heard Wen shouting and\nher mind had filled with the worst sort of imaginings. Then\nthere had been footsteps and a gunshot. Now, without any\nsense of Perception, she had no idea if her sister-in-law was\nstill alive.

She’d counted on the possibility\nof using her position as Weather Man to negotiate for Wen’s\nlife, but no one had come into the bare room to see her in\nmany hours.\nShe grew heavy-headed and fell unconscious for\nindeterminable periods of time. After what she guessed to be\nover a full day, the door opened and two men came into the\nroom: a short, mean-looking man in cargo pants and a skull\npendant of bluffer’s jade, and a young man with a tattoo on the\nside of his neck. The short man, who seemed to be the leader,\nsaid, mockingly, “You must be getting bored, Kaul\nShaelinsan.”\nThe younger man went behind the chair and untied the\ngag. Shae moved her sore jaw and tried to force saliva into her\ndry throat. “Did you kill my sister-in-law?”\nThe barukan leader smirked at the torment he knew she\nmust be feeling. “On the contrary, she’s on her way home right\nnow,” he said. “Your brother loves his wife very much and\npaid the full ransom for her safe return.”\nShae wished desperately she had her jade and the\nPerception to discern if the man was lying. She couldn’t help\nbut clutch at the hope that he was telling the truth, that Wen\nwas indeed free. She kept her voice carefully neutral. “If that’s\ntrue, then there’s a lot more we could talk about. You know\nwho I am and how much jade and money I control. I’m sure\nwe can come to some sort of deal.”\n“I’m sure we can,” said the barukan leader in his accented\nKekonese, his lips rising in a way that made Shae distinctly\nuneasy. “After all, the most valuable thing that the Weather\nMan of a clan possesses isn’t jade or money. It’s information.”\nHe stepped forward directly in front of her, fixing Shae\nwith his bulging eyes. “Your clan came into Shotar by making\nfriends with the police and the government. You give them\ninformation from your spies. Two months ago, federal agents\nbusted a shipment of sweet flour worth two and a half million\nsepas—there’s no way they could’ve known about that deal\nunless there was a rat in the Matyos.”\nShae shook her head slowly. “You’re not Matyos.” Due to\nNo Peak’s spy network in Shotar and its cooperation with\nShotarian law enforcement, she was aware of who the main\nleaders of the Matyos were, and these men were not among\nthem.\n“Fuck the Matyos,” the man snapped. “They bring the\ngoods through Oortoko, but they lean on us to move and guard\nthe product, so it’s Faltas who end up dead or in prison and the\nMatyos blame us for the lost dope, when it’s No Peak rats who\nare to blame.” He leaned so close she could smell his strangely\nsweet cologne mingling with his sour breath. “Two weeks\nafter that bust, the No Peak clan received business permits and\nliquor licenses for four properties it had recently acquired in\nLeyolo City. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but I don’t believe in\ncoincidences. Who was your rat?”"

The Horn’s side of the clan manages\ninformers.” Ordinarily, that would be a plausible denial, but\nShae had been personally involved in every aspect of the\nclan’s risky expansion into Shotar. She’d worked with Lott and\nHejo. She’d seen the names.\n“You must think that we don’t know how to use our jade,\nthat we can’t tell you’re lying,” said the Faltas captain,\nsounding insulted. “Perhaps you don’t understand: No one is\ngoing to rescue you. Your brother has his wife back safe and\nsound and is pulling your clan’s Green Bones out of the\ncountry. If you give us what we want, you can have a pleasant\nstay with us and go home as well. If not, it will be over a week\nbefore they start hunting for your body. I don’t want to have to\ndo that to a woman.”\nAs the leader spoke, another man came into the room with\ncoils of rope and chains. Shae’s mouth went drier than dirt.\nThe men lashed her ankles and wrists, then untied her from the\nchair and wound rope and chains around her torso and legs,\nsecuring them with padlocks, until she was entirely\nimmobilized, like an escape artist about to be lowered into a\nclosed container only to astound everyone with a feat of\nmagic. Except that Shae had no such trick. Her heart was\nrunning like a jackhammer.\nThe younger man lifted her over his shoulder like a heavy\nsack of rice and carried her into a bathroom with a Shotarian-\nstyle soaking tub large enough for three or four people. Dudo\nwas sitting in the dry tub, also securely bound and weighed\ndown with chains. When the barukan placed Shae inside the\ntub across from him, the Fist raised his bowed head. Dudo’s\nface was badly bruised and his eyes were having difficulty\nfocusing. The blow to the back of his head had given him a\nconcussion. “Kaul-jen,” he croaked. “I’m sorry I failed to\nprotect you.”\nShae couldn’t manage a reply. It was not Dudo’s fault, but\nhers. It had been her decision to expand into Shotar and make\nenemies of the barukan. She had brought Wen on this trip, and\nshe had ordered Dudo to stop the car for the false police\nofficer. Like so many choices she’d made in her life, they’d\nseemed reasonable at the time.\n“You may be one tough Green Bone bitch,” said the\nbarukan leader, “but are you soulless enough to watch another\nperson suffer and die for your stubbornness?”\nShae felt a strange urge to tell him that she was no stranger\nto seeing others pay for her mistakes. Lan, whom she’d failed\nas a sister. Maro, dead by her hand. Luto, her chief of staff for\nonly a few months. Wen and Anden, ambushed in Espenia.\nThe unborn child she’d aborted.

The white ceramic was cold\nagainst her bare legs.\n“Give me names,” said the short man. “The names of your\nrats.”\nIf she surrendered the identities of No Peak’s sources,\nthose people would surely die horrible deaths of their own.\nShe would cause death and suffering no matter what.\n“No? I’ll even give you a choice,” the man went on\nreasonably. “How about the names of the officials in the police\nand government who are on No Peak’s payroll?”\nWith such a gold mine of information constituting vital\nimportance to the Shotarian underworld, the kidnappers had no\nneed to fear No Peak’s retribution. They could count on\nprotection from the Matyos. They could even sell their\nknowledge to the Mountain clan, to cleanse No Peak from\nShotar, regardless of what Hilo decided to do.\nDudo roused enough to slur, “You’re all dead men, you\nbarukan dogs.”\nThe leader motioned for two metal briefcases to be brought\ninto the bathroom and set down on the linoleum floor. He\nunlatched the cases and opened them to reveal piles of cut and\npolished jade. Gemstones of various sizes and weights, ready\nto be set and worn, all of it gleaming with deep, translucent\nbrilliance even in the dim yellow of the bathroom’s sconce\nlighting.\nShae sucked in a breath. It was a staggering fortune, a\ntreasure trove of near mythological scale. The barukan in the\nroom stared in rapt admiration. Some of them began fingering\ntheir own meager adornments, no doubt imagining themselves\nas Baijen reborn, wearing more jade than any Green Bone.\nTheir leader whistled low. “Beautiful, isn’t it? Beautiful and\ndeadly.”\nTwo men pulled on thick, lead-lined gloves and lifted the\nfirst briefcase over the edge of the tub, tipping all of its\ncontents inside. Jade clattered against the inside of the tub like\npennies thrown into a pail, spilling over Shae’s and Dudo’s\nlegs. The barukan hefted the second briefcase as well, piling\ntens of millions of dien worth of jade into a thick layer that\ncovered the bottom of the tub like green glass pebbles at the\nbottom of a fish tank. Shae jerked and tried instinctively to\npull herself away from the cascade, but it was futile.\nThousands of pieces of jade—more jade than any human being\nwithout jade immunity should ever be in contact with at one\ntime—tumbled on top of her thighs and calves, were caught\nbetween the toes of her bare feet, became trapped under her\nclothes as she struggled in mounting panic.\nMany years ago, Shae had visited a jade mine high up in\nthe mountainous interior of Kekon.

In that instant she grasped for her\nabilities, tried with a desperate cry to focus every iota of her\nformidable training into enough Strength to break her chains.\nThe ropes and metal links strained but held—and then the pain\nbegan. It escalated quickly, as if she’d thrown herself\nstruggling against a huge metal door, only to discover that it\nwas warming to a red-hot temperature and she was now\nwelded to the surface, unable to tear free as it began to glow\ncrimson and burn her alive.\nShae had all the jade tolerance of a top-rank Green Bone,\nbuilt up over a lifetime of exposure and training. Her body was\nintimately familiar with jade. So it was a hideous violent\nperversion that what had been natural throughout her entire\nadult life suddenly turned into sheer agony. She tried with\nmindless desperation to grasp for the control techniques she’d\nknown since she was a child—awareness of her breath,\ndispelling tension in the body, visualization—all of it was\nuseless. She was drowning in a flaming deluge. Even if she\nweren’t immobilized with restraints, she couldn’t summon\nStrength or Channeling or anything that could help her escape\nany more than someone could control a kite inside a cyclone.\nShe plummeted back into physical sensation: Her muscles\nbegan to shake uncontrollably, sweat broke out all over her\nbody, her heart rate and temperature and blood pressure\nskyrocketed.\nShe saw the cords of Dudo’s neck stand out as he\nscreamed.\n“This jade is from No Peak’s own vaults,” Shae heard the\nshort barukan leader say thoughtfully as if from a great\ndistance. “Isn’t that poetic?”\nCHAPTER\n47\nWhat Must Be Done\nH\nilo sat on the edge of the bed, watching the blankets rise\nand fall gently in time with Wen’s breath. After the tearful\nrelief of coming home, there had been utter exhaustion; she’d\nfinally fallen into a deep slumber. He touched the back of his\nhand to her cheek, reassuring himself that she was truly there,\nthat he was not in a hopeful dream from which he would\nawaken to the nightmare of her still being lost and in danger.\nSlowly, he bent and pressed his lips to her brow, careful not to\nwake her.\nHe rose, dressed quietly, and went downstairs. Anden was\nsitting on the bottom step of the staircase, his shoes already on,\nwaiting. “Let’s go,” Hilo said.\nAnden drove the Pillar’s new Duchesse Imperia south on\nLo Low Street.

The sun was not up yet and the streets of\nJanloon were shambling through the shift change between the\ncity’s nighttime denizens and its earliest risers—drunks,\nprostitutes, and graveyard shift workers stumbling home while\nstreet hawkers, newsstand owners, and shopkeepers opened up\nfor business.\nHilo broke the silence. “This reminds me of that time you\ndrove us to the Twice Lucky on New Year’s Day.”\nAnden said, “That was a long time ago.”\n“A long time ago,” Hilo agreed. “You’re a much better\ndriver now.” When Anden glanced over at him with a\nfurrowed brow, Hilo broke into his famous lopsided grin.\n“I’m glad you’re not counting on me to kill anyone today,”\nAnden said. On the other side of the Lo Low Street tunnel, he\ntook the interchange onto Patriot Street and turned into High\nGround, navigating the large bulk of the Duchesse up hilly\nresidential roads. The corners of Anden’s mouth lifted a little.\n“I didn’t think we’d ever joke about that day.”\n“Let’s hope we’ll feel the same way about today in another\ntwenty years.” Hilo draped an arm out the open window and\ngazed at the sunrise crawling over the manicured trees. “Gods.\nWe were young men back then, Andy,” he said, losing the\nlightness in his voice. “That day, I was ready to die at the\nhands of Gont Asch if I had to. Now … I could still do it, but I\nthink it would be harder. You’d think it would be easier to face\ndeath as you get older, but it doesn’t work that way. You get\nmore attached to life, to people you love and things that are\nworth living for.”\nHilo saw his cousin eyeing him with concern, and he said,\n“Don’t look so worried, Andy. As much as I didn’t want to\nhear it, you were right, what you said last night. We lose no\nmatter what, so this is the only way. You know what to do if\nyou have to.”\nAnden said, “I know, Hilo-jen.”\n“When something has to be done, there’s always a way to\ndo it,” Hilo said quietly. They pulled up outside of the\nenormous iron gates of the Ayt mansion. The security cameras\nmounted along the approaching road had already alerted the\nguards to their arrival. Four Mountain Green Bones armed\nwith moon blades and handguns met the Duchesse in front of\nthe gates. Anden stopped the car and shut off the engine, then\nlifted his hands off the steering wheel, holding them open for\nthe guards to see.\nHilo opened the door and stepped out. His Perception\nbuzzed with the hostile alertness of the four Green Bones in\nfront of him and two others inside the gate that he couldn’t\nsee. He raised his voice to the guards. “I’m here to see your\nPillar.”\n_______\nOne morning when he was twenty-two years old, Hilo met his\nolder brother, Lan, for breakfast at the Twice Lucky restaurant.\nIt was the first time he’d ever eaten there, and he was\npleasantly surprised that although it was an older place, loud"

Lan, however, did not appear to be paying attention\nto either the meal or their conversation. He seemed troubled\nand didn’t smile at anything Hilo said.\nIn Hilo’s opinion, there was little for Lan to be unhappy\nabout. His brother wore plenty of jade, was recently married,\nand their grandfather was giving him an increasing amount of\nresponsibility over the day-to-day running of the clan. At last,\nHilo threw his napkin down. “What’s wrong with you,\nanyway? You have this look on your face like you’ve been\nconstipated for days.”\nLan’s expression twitched with surprise, then annoyance.\n“I have things on my mind, Hilo,” he replied. “I don’t happen\nto share every single issue that’s bothering me.”\nHilo scratched his jaw and considered this, feeling a little\nhurt by the dismissal. True, he and Lan were not close in the\nmanner of siblings who were similar in age. They had not\ngrown up as rivals or confidants. Nevertheless, there was an\nunspoken understanding between them, because one day Lan\nwould be the Pillar and Hilo would be his Horn. He would\nswear oaths to his older brother, to obey him, to kill and die\nfor him if necessary. So he felt it was only fair that Lan trust\nhim enough to explain why he was ruining a perfectly good\nbreakfast with his melancholy. “Is it something to do with that\nmeeting Grandda had last week?”\nLan’s left eye narrowed into a squint. “How do you know\nabout that?”\nHilo shrugged. “Is it or isn’t it?”\nLan exhaled through his nose, as if giving in, but he\nrelaxed slightly, apparently relieved to finally talk about what\nwas troubling him. “You know that Grandda and Uncle Doru\nare worried about who will succeed Ayt Yu as Pillar of the\nMountain.”\n“Ayt’s not that old,” Hilo said. “He could be Pillar for\nanother ten years.”\n“The rumor is that he’s taken off some of his jade because\nof high blood pressure. The Spear of Kekon might be a living\nlegend, but if his jade tolerance is starting to go, it won’t be\nlong before he has to retire. Maybe five years, maybe less. Ayt\nEodo is his son by adoption, not blood, and Eodo’s a joke, not\nrespected as a Green Bone.”\nHilo broke apart one of the nut pastries. “His daughter is\nthe Weather Man.”\n“A woman Pillar?” Lan shook his head. “Ayt won’t go that\nfar. So the door is open for some other family in the Mountain\nclan to rise into the leadership.”\n“Why’s any of this our problem?” Hilo asked. “The\nMountain can sort out its own shit.” As a junior Fist, he had no\nlove for the Mountain clan. He and his peers had skirmished\nviolently with them for territory and business, particularly in\ndisputed districts, and some of those confrontations had left\nhard feelings on both sides."

He and his peers had skirmished\nviolently with them for territory and business, particularly in\ndisputed districts, and some of those confrontations had left\nhard feelings on both sides.\n“Grandda and Uncle Doru had a meeting last week with\nTanku Ushijan,” Lan said. “The Horn of the Mountain\nproposed that we unite our families through marriage.”\nHilo stopped in mid-chew. The thought of Wen flashed\nthrough his mind. He was not one to keep secrets, but he\nhadn’t yet told his grandfather or his brother that he was in\nlove with a girl in the Maik family, a stone-eye. His face or his\njade aura must’ve given away his sudden panic because Lan\nsaid, with a dry smile, “I don’t think I’ve ever been able to\nscare you like that before. Is the idea of settling down really\nthat frightening? Anyway, you’re safe. Tanku’s son, Din, is a\nfirst-rank Fist. People are saying he could follow in his\nfather’s footsteps and become Horn. A marriage between Shae\nand Tanku Din would tie the leadership of both clans\ntogether.”\nRelief washed over Hilo and he began breathing again. He\nfinished chewing and swallowing. “Grandda won’t go for it,”\nhe said with confidence. “Shae’s his favorite.”\nLan didn’t reply at first, but the texture of his jade aura\ngrew scratchy as he pushed at the food on his plate. “When it\ncomes to decisions about what’s best for the clan, sometimes\nthere’s no room for personal feelings, not even for the Pillar.\nDoru thinks it’s a good idea, and you know how much sway he\nhas with Grandda.”\nHilo grimaced. “Doru should go back to the Three Crowns\nera where he came from.” The creaky old Weather Man\nwould’ve been one of those scheming palace courtiers.\nLan looked at his younger brother with a resignation that\nHilo would not understand for many more years, not until he\nwas Pillar himself. “Grandda and Ayt Yu have had their\ndifferences over the years, but now that they’re both getting\nolder, they want to ensure there’s still respect between the\nclans after they’re gone. That’s getting harder to do when we\nhave different businesses, different territories, different\nschools.” Lan tugged absently at the jade-studded cuffs on his\nforearms, uncertainty written on his face. “The Tanku family\nsays that if we ally with them, Ayt Yu will pass over that\nplayboy Eodo and name Tanku Ushi as the next Pillar of the\nMountain. It would prevent infighting over the succession and\nassure everyone of peaceful relations. Shae would be\ndaughter-in-law to their Pillar, and if the younger Tanku is\npromoted, we would be brothers-in-law to their Horn.”\nHilo was liking this vision of the future less and less the\nmore he heard. He had no personal grudge against the Tankus,\nbut he certainly didn’t want them as in-laws. The elder Tanku\nwas in his fifties; his son was two years older than Lan. If the\nfamilies merged, the Tankus would be dominant. How was\nLan supposed to maintain his own standing as Pillar against a"

How was\nLan supposed to maintain his own standing as Pillar against a\nman who was essentially his father-in-law? And if Hilo\nbecame the Horn of No Peak, he would surely have to face his\nown brother-in-law as a rival and be forced to back down to\nprotect his sister’s marriage. A union might preserve the peace\nfor the foreseeable future, but in the long run, surely No Peak\nwould be diminished. It might even become a tributary of the\nMountain.\nHe was still not worried, though, because he knew his\nsister. “Shae will never agree,” he scoffed.\nLan tapped out a cigarette for himself and offered the pack\nto his younger brother, who took one, even though it was not\nhis preferred brand. “You and I know that,” Lan said. “I don’t\nthink Grandda does. He’s always doted on Shae, so he believes\nshe’ll obey him. If she doesn’t, we’ll lose face with Ayt Yu and\nthe Tankus. No matter what, the family’s not going to be the\nsame after this.” At Hilo’s silence, Lan grumbled, “So that’s\nwhy I haven’t been so cheerful this morning. And now I can\ntell I’ve ruined your morning as well, although it’s your own\nfault for asking.”\nHilo lit his cigarette but found he couldn’t enjoy the taste.\n“The old man hasn’t given his answer to the Tankus yet, has\nhe? Maybe you can still talk him out of it.”\n“Maybe,” Lan said, not sounding hopeful. “Grandda’s\ngetting more stubborn as he gets older. You know the position\nI’m in. In the end, it’s his decision.”\nThe owner of the restaurant came to their table to\nintroduce himself as Mr. Une and to ask if there was anything\nunsatisfactory with the meal since Lan hadn’t eaten much.\nWhen they assured him the food was excellent, the\nrestaurateur saluted them deeply, saying he was pleased to\nserve the Pillar’s grandsons, and he hoped they would carry a\nfavorable review of his humble establishment to the Torch\nhimself.\nLan conversed with Mr. Une with all the courteous gravity\nHilo had watched him develop over the past few years, but his\nsmile was thin. Grandda was already seventy-six, much older\nthan Ayt Yugontin, yet despite grooming Lan for the\nleadership, he had not yet announced his own retirement. Lan\nwas in a predicament as the Pillar-in-waiting. No matter how\nmuch he disagreed with Kaul Sen, defying or disobeying him\nmight further delay when he would be named Pillar.\nWhen Mr. Une left, Lan said to Hilo, “Not a word of this\nto Shae, understand? I don’t want to start any feud between her\nand Grandda if we can avoid it.”\nTwo years later, Shae would feud vociferously with their\ngrandfather all on her own, but at the time, neither Lan nor\nHilo knew what was to come.\n“I’m trusting you, Hilo,” Lan said. “Swear you’ll keep it\nquiet.”\nHilo widened his eyes innocently and spread his hands"

He doubted\nhis brother confided about clan issues with that haughty wife\nof his. “Anyway, I’m not stupid enough to be the one to\ndeliver the bad news. If Shae found out from me, she’d\nprobably throw me off a roof.” They sat together in silence for\na few minutes, finishing their cigarettes. Hilo said, “I’m glad\nI’m just a Fist and don’t have to deal with the clan politics\nbullshit that you do.”\nBut Hilo did not stop thinking about what Lan had told\nhim. Their grandfather was an old fool, Hilo decided, for\ntrying to turn back the clock, on a decision he had made, no\nless. The One Mountain Society had divided a generation ago.\nAttempting to bring the Mountain and No Peak together made\nabout as much sense as trying to glue a cracked egg. Instead of\nbehaving like an ancient warlord by arranging a political\nmarriage for Shae, Grandda ought to simply retire. Once Lan\nwas in charge of the clan, he could name Hilo his Horn and\nShae his Weather Man. Together, they would be stronger than\nthe Tankus or any of Ayt Yu’s potential successors, instead of\nyoked to them like some feudal tributary. The sooner Lan took\nover as Pillar, the better.\nThe more Hilo thought about it, the angrier he grew toward\nhis elders. He was also selfishly worried about his own\nprospects. He was too young, in everyone’s opinion, to rise to\nthe position of Horn for several more years. When Lan became\nthe Pillar, he would be expected to choose a senior warrior to\ncommand the military side of the clan, someone with a great\ndeal of jade and experience.\nHilo couldn’t afford to gradually rise up the ranks,\nawaiting his turn. Even in retirement, their grandfather was\nsure to have a say in everything. Lan would be surrounded by\nold cronies. Unless he was the Horn, Hilo couldn’t be certain\nof having influence with his elder brother or authority in the\nclan, nor would he have enough status in No Peak to make\neveryone accept his relationship with Wen.\nMuch to the delight of Mr. Une, Hilo returned to the Twice\nLucky two days later to try its dinner menu. This time he had\nMaik Kehn and Maik Tar with him. Lan had told him not to\nspeak to Shae, but Hilo decided he could safely discuss the\nsituation with his two closest and most trustworthy fellow\nFists.\n“I have to kill Tanku Din,” he told them after the\nappetizers arrived.\nTar paused with a crispy squid ball halfway toward his\nmouth. “The son of the Mountain’s Horn? Big, mean fellow\nwith the flat nose and a shitload of jade?”\n“That’s the one,” Hilo said. “And it has to be soon, and\nwith a clean blade.”\n“It’s been nice knowing you, keke,” Tar quipped. “I’ll ask\nthe gods to recognize you.” When he saw that Hilo was"

But even you’re\nnot Baijen reborn. Tanku Din is above our level, at least for\nnow.” Tanku Din was a first-rank Fist of the Mountain. Duels\nbetween Green Bones were usually fought between those of\nroughly equal status. It was poor form to fight someone\nbeneath one’s own level, and simply unwise to challenge\nsomeone far more heavily jaded than oneself. It was possible\nto win against someone with a significant jade advantage, just\nas it was possible to prevail against an opponent who was\ntwice one’s size. Possible, but unlikely.\nKehn said, “What sort of grudge do you have against\nTanku that it can’t wait?”\n“Nothing personal. I barely know the man, though I don’t\nespecially care to.” Tanku Din had a reputation for being an\nexcellent fighter and an organized Fist, but also a petty human\nbeing, someone easily angered by criticism, who would punish\nsubordinates or abandon Lantern Men for offending him in\nminor ways.\nHilo explained the situation to the Maiks and his reasoning\nbehind the need to act urgently. “Grandda can’t make Shae\nmarry a dead man.”\nEven Kehn and Tar looked a little taken aback at this,\nalthough they couldn’t argue with the logic. Kehn rubbed the\nback of his neck and blew out a contemplative breath. “One-\non-one is too risky. Maybe we could take him together in an\nambush.”\nHilo shook his head. “We can’t have anyone thinking that\nLan whispered his name to me. Lan has to stay on Grandda’s\ngood side until the old man finally steps down. So it has to\nseem unplanned.” When the Maik brothers looked at each\nother with undisguised skepticism, Hilo snapped, “Don’t ever\nsit in front of me with a look that says you’re giving up right\naway. Think about the Charge of Twenty. My own father\nfound a way to do the impossible at the cost of his own life\nbecause failing wasn’t an option. When something has to be\ndone, there’s always a way to do it.” This was to become\nsomething he was known to say to his many Fists in the years\nto come.\nThe following Thirdday afternoon, Hilo and the Maik\nbrothers drove into Mountain territory and visited a bar in a\nneighborhood they knew was controlled by Tanku Din and his\nFingers. Hilo strode into the Black Goose, set his sheathed\nmoon blade on a table, and declared to the bartender, “My\nfriends and I aren’t here to cause trouble. We’re just looking to\nhave a drink or two.”\nHilo and the Maiks sat down and each ordered a beer.\nThey drank and talked and ordered more beers, followed by a\nbottle of hoji. After two hours, the bartender went to the back\nof the building and phoned Tanku Din, who arrived fifteen\nminutes later to see what the trouble was with the No Peak\nGreen Bones who weren’t leaving a Mountain property.

When\nTanku arrived, Hilo’s face lit up and he motioned the\nMountain Fist over to their table. “Tanku-jen, come have a\ndrink with us!”\nTanku looked at the several empty beer and hoji glasses on\nthe table and said, “I think you’ve had enough, Kaul. You\nrealize you’re in the Stump, don’t you? It’s time for you to go\nhome.” He rested a hand casually on the hilt of his moon\nblade.\n“That’s not a very hospitable thing to say to family,” Hilo\nreplied. “You’re going to marry my little sister, aren’t you?\nWe’re going to be brothers, so my home will be your home,\nand your home”—he gestured around the bar—“will be my\nhome.”\nTanku blinked in surprise, then leaned his hands on the\ntable, glancing at the Maiks before lowering his voice to Hilo.\n“How do you know that?”\n“Tanku-jen, you don’t know what you’re getting into. My\nlittle sister’s spoiled. My grandfather told her the good news,\nand she came to me crying her eyes out, saying that she didn’t\nwant to be married off to a pig-faced brute.” The thought of\nShae coming to him with any of her problems, much less in\ntears, was so amusing to Hilo that his grin was genuine. If\nTanku had an especially good sense of Perception, maybe he\ncould sense that Hilo was spinning a tale, but it didn’t really\nmatter.\nTanku’s face flushed dark at the insult. Nevertheless, he\nseemed to reconsider his tone with Hilo. Pushing aside a\ncluster of empty drink glasses, he made space for himself at\nthe table and sat down. Neither of the Maiks shifted over for\nhim. Kehn scowled at the newcomer blearily. Tar was resting\nhis head on the table, using his arm as a pillow. Tanku\nwrinkled his nose, and said to Hilo, “Look, Kaul, neither of us\nhas a choice in the matter, so let’s not get off on the wrong foot\nwith each other. I’ll treat your sister well. She’ll have money, a\nnice house, whatever she wants.”\n“That’s exactly what I told her,” Hilo exclaimed with\nvigor. “And I also reassured her that you’re not nearly as\nstupid or ugly as people say you are. She still wasn’t happy, so\nI promised to talk to you in person to clear a few things up.”\nHilo tossed back the hoji in his glass, then leaned forward and\nraised a finger, taking a long time to gather his thoughts. “First\nof all, I’m frankly relieved that she’s going to be your problem\nand not mine anymore. But if you ever hit her, I will kill you.\nSecond, your pussy-hunting days are over. I don’t want my\nlittle sister catching some nasty disease from your wandering\ncock or being treated like another one of your whores. Third\n…” He squinted blearily at Tanku’s face, which was reddening\nwith anger. “I can’t remember what the third thing was."

Let’s have a toast to our\nimpending brotherhood, you prick.” He stole Tar’s glass and\npoured a shot of hoji for Tanku and then himself, spilling half\nthe pour over the rim onto the sticky table.\nTanku stood up. “You’re drunk out of your mind,” he said\nwith disgust. “Get out, and come back with your ear in a box\nwhen you’re sober.” When no one at the table moved, Tanku\nseized Hilo by the upper arm and began to pull him out of his\nchair.\nHilo yanked his arm away. “Don’t fucking touch me,” he\nshouted, his bloodshot eyes blazing, spittle flying from his\nmouth. “You Tankus used to be goatfucking southerners and\nnow you think you’re at the level of us Kauls? You think you\ncan push my grandda around and get what you want from us?\nYou don’t deserve us.”\nThe roughly dozen other customers in the Black Goose had\nbeen eyeing the table with the Green Bones nervously, and\nnow many of them took their drinks and food and moved to\ntables farther away from the confrontation. The bartender\ncleared his throat and said, “Tanku-jen, do you want me to call\nanyone?”\nTanku answered without turning around. “No, don’t\nbother.” He was taller and larger than Hilo, and now he\nloomed over the younger Fist like he was about to wrap his\nhands around his future brother-in-law’s throat. “I’d heard you\nwere a reckless, arrogant bastard, but I didn’t expect you’d be\nso pathetic. I thought you’d be more like your brother, but\nyou’re an idiot pup, and from what I hear, your little sister’s a\nwhore who runs around with foreigners. I bet no other man\nwill have her. It’s your family that doesn’t deserve ours. If not\nfor your grandfather, you’d be less than trash.”\nHilo staggered to his feet. “Tanku Din, I offer you a clean\nblade.”\nThe Mountain Fist snorted in derision. “I don’t duel\ndrunken boys.”\n“Coward,” Hilo spat. “Piss drinker. Dog fucker. Take my\nclean blade or I’ll trash this building, you pussy.” He put his\nface right up to Tanku. “Knife or blade?”\nHe saw the inevitable decision being made. Tanku’s eyes\nwent black with malice. The man’s thick jade aura was\nshrilling with eagerness to send this offensive young No Peak\nFist to the hospital. “Blade,” he said. “Right now.”\nIt was not ideal. Hilo had hoped Tanku would issue the\nchallenge to him, so he could choose the talon knife. Despite\nhis reputation for being thin-skinned, Tanku had resisted the\nbaiting better than Hilo had anticipated. Hilo grabbed his\nmoon blade and kicked the Maiks’ chairs. “Come on,” he said.\n“I’m dueling.” He weaved his way out the back door and into\nthe alley behind the Black Goose."

Only now\nthat he was about to face the man in combat did it truly strike\nHilo that there was a good chance he could end up dead or\nmaimed, the jade torn from his body. Clean-bladed duels were\nunpredictable, and even if Tanku Din didn’t intend to kill him,\nhe might be angry enough to do so in the heat of the moment.\nThe Mountain Fist wore twice as much jade as Hilo: a row of\nstuds in the cartilage of both ears and stacked bracelets on his\nwrists. Hilo could tell, simply from the way the man moved\nand the confident manner with which he held his moon blade,\nthat he was an opponent to be feared.\nHilo had not spoken of his wild plan to anyone other than\nKehn and Tar. That could hardly be helped, but now he\nregretted not having said some small thing to Wen before he\nleft. He wondered, abruptly, if his own father had said\nanything to him and his siblings before he’d left to fight for\nthe last time. Hilo held his moon blade out to the Maik\nbrothers, who both spat on the metal for luck. “If I die, tell my\nfamily I fought well,” he declared to Tanku and the more\ndaring bar patrons who were watching from the mouth of the\nalley.\nThe combatants touched their blades to their foreheads in\nsalute. Hilo attacked immediately, rushing in Light with a\nblindingly fast hurricane of slices. Tanku parried the cuts\nexpertly and countered with precise, powerful strokes,\nshearing Hilo’s weapon with steady, battering force. It took\nHilo all of three seconds to grudgingly admit that Tanku was\nmore skilled with the moon blade than he was. He wasn’t\nsurprised, but that didn’t make the fact easier to swallow under\nthe circumstances.\nStaggering back from the man’s Strength, Hilo\nrepositioned his stance and attempted to create defensive space\nby throwing up a quick Deflection. Tanku twisted his body and\ndispelled the energy with a perpendicular cross-Deflection\nbefore Hilo’s wave could travel even an arm’s length from his\nbody. Hilo pulled in his jade energy for another try, but when\nthe tip of his moon blade dipped, Tanku’s weapon darted\ninstantly into the momentary opening, slashing him across the\ntop of his sword arm. Hilo Steeled in time to prevent a terrible\ngash, but it hurt badly.\n“Where’s your shit-talking now, Kaul?” Tanku asked with\na smirk.\nWith a snarl, Hilo charged Tanku with the fury of a bull,\nslashing and hacking. Tanku kept his Steel up, flexing and\nshifting it with each of his opponent’s attacks.

He retched and\nspat. Kehn yelled, convincingly, “Hilo-jen! Concede before he\nreally hurts you.”\n“Listen to your friend, Kaul,” Tanku suggested, lowering\nhis weapon. The fury in the man’s jade aura was ebbing with\nthe satisfaction of seeing his arrogant opponent in great pain\nand so thoroughly outclassed. Tanku’s energy hummed\nconfident and steady. He could fight like this forever.\nHilo sucked in a wounded breath along with his jade\nenergy and leapt Light at Tanku, who tossed up a Deflection\nthat threw Hilo against the brick wall. Hilo managed,\nsomehow, to Steel against the impact and still hang on to his\nweapon as he crashed to the floor of the alley.\n“You really want me to kill you?” Tanku asked.\nFrom the corner of his blurry vision, he glimpsed Tar\ntaking an alarmed step forward before Kehn stopped him. Hilo\nshook his head as if clearing cobwebs from his eyes. He’d told\nthe Maiks that he held no personal grudge against Tanku. Now,\nHilo saw the man’s scornful thoughts written clearly across his\nface and in the relaxed set of his shoulders: You’re a stupid\nkid, a thug, that’s all—and he found it easy to summon a real\nsense of hatred.\nHilo crawled to his feet and came forward again like a\nstubborn mule. Tanku sighed. He caught Hilo’s sluggish\ndownstroke and they clinched close, blades locked. Hilo spat\nin Tanku’s face. The man flinched and Hilo, who had\ndeliberately not employed Channeling once in the entire fight\nso far, sent a spear of destructive energy straight toward the\nman’s sternum.\nThe unexpected suddenness and power of the attack caught\nTanku off guard. All his Steel came up into his chest like a\ndoor slamming, and with stone-cold sober precision, Hilo went\nlow and slashed open the man’s femoral artery.\nTanku’s eyes flew open in abject astonishment as blood\nemptied down his legs upon the asphalt. Without any\nsluggishness or hesitation, Hilo’s left hand seized Tanku by a\nfistful of his hair, jerking forward with all his Strength to bring\nthe man’s throat down onto the edge of his moving moon\nblade with a horrible sound.\nFor several seconds after Tanku’s body hit the ground,\nHilo stood panting in a fog of adrenaline, barely able to\nbelieve he’d done it. The small group of spectators from the\nBlack Goose stared at the scene openmouthed. Hilo recovered\nhis wits. Raising his moon blade, he wiped it down the inside\nof his sleeve. “My blade is clean.”\nClean blade or not, he needed to get back to No Peak\nterritory as fast as possible. The bartender had already run\nback into the building, no doubt to alert other members of the\nMountain clan, who would arrive within minutes. Hilo\ncouldn’t count on the Maiks for much help.

They were both\nextremely drunk, having surreptitiously consumed Hilo’s\nalcohol for him over the course of hours. A squeeze of lemon\njuice had made Hilo’s eyes bloodshot and a whole spicy\npepper had made him sweat and raised his heart rate, so when\nhe confronted Tanku, he would appear to be what the older\nFist expected of him—drunken, heedless, unworthy of a real\nfight.\nLater, Hilo would recall, as if in a disjointed dream, the\nfrantic rush to collect Tanku’s jade and get all three of them\nback to the car, followed by the madcap drive with one hand\non the wheel and the other staunching his wounds with wads\nof cloth that Tar tore from his shirt and handed to him from the\nback seat. The amount of jade Hilo claimed in that one day\nmade him the most heavily jaded junior Fist in all of Janloon.\nKaul Sen was apoplectic. He harangued his youngest\ngrandson for being an impulsive lunatic and had him whipped\nso severely that Hilo was bedridden for three days. Even lying\naround in pain, Hilo was rather satisfied with himself. His\ngrandfather could whip him all he liked, but he couldn’t put\nhis plans back together, he couldn’t bring Tanku Din back to\nlife.\nThe only problem, as Kehn wisely reminded Hilo, was that\nhe’d now made a mortal enemy of Tanku Ushijan, the slain\nFist’s father and Horn of the Mountain clan. A clean blade\nnotwithstanding, the man was not going to forgive the\ndisingenuous murder of his only son and would surely find\nsome justification and means to kill Hilo in the future.\nHilo was secretly and profoundly relieved a year and a half\nlater, when Ayt Yugontin died from a stroke and his adopted\ndaughter, Ayt Madashi, shocked everyone by immediately\nkilling Tanku Ushijan and his closest Fists. Hilo didn’t know\nmuch about Ayt Mada, but she’d inadvertently done him a\ngreat favor by eliminating the one man Hilo feared would be\nhis most dedicated enemy.\nBy that time, Kaul Sen’s wife had passed away, and Shae\nhad fallen out with the family and fled to Espenia. A few\nmonths later, weary and despondent, the Torch of Kekon\nretired at last. Within a year, Lan named his younger brother as\nhis Horn. At age twenty-five, Hilo was the youngest Horn\nanyone could recall.\nAt times, when faced with difficult decisions, he would\nthink back to the duel that had dramatically earned him his\njade and reputation, and he would remind himself that\nsometimes the most obvious solution required only the\nwillingness to take the most unreasonable of actions.\n_______\nTwo Green Bone guards of the Mountain clan escorted Hilo\nthrough the front doors of the Ayt mansion. It was not a place\nHilo had ever expected to visit, and he couldn’t help but look\naround curiously at the expansive entryway with its inlaid\nwood flooring, mounted antique weapons, and landscape art.

It\nwas precisely the sort of home Hilo expected from a wealthy,\npowerful, unmarried and childless tycoon—stately and well-\ndesigned, everything in its proper place but lacking any human\nwarmth.\nThe two Fists motioned Hilo to a stop in the foyer, where\nhe waited, Perceiving the approach of that long-hated dense\nred aura. Two other men pulled open a pair of wooden sliding\ndoors and Ayt Madashi stepped inside from the garden. The\ndoors shut behind her. Hilo glanced left and right as an\nadditional pair of Green Bones appeared silently from the\nhallways that stretched to either side, bringing the total\nnumber of Ayt’s bodyguards in the room to six.\n“A little excessive,” he commented wryly. He’d come\ncompletely unarmed, with no blade or knife or gun.\n“It’s been my experience,” Ayt replied, “that no measures\nare excessive when it comes to dealing with you, Kaul\nHiloshudon.” Ayt was more paranoid than she used to be. Hilo\nrecalled that she used to go around without bodyguards at all,\nas if to make a public statement of confidence in her own jade\nabilities. She did not do that anymore.\n“I’d like to speak alone,” Hilo said. “As one Pillar to\nanother.” When she regarded him with deep incredulity, he\nspread his hands. “I didn’t come here by myself to commit\nsuicide. And I think you’ll prefer that what I say remain\nprivate.”\nAyt’s mouth flattened into a line. “One would think that\nyour arrogance would at some point cease to surprise me.” She\nspoke to her Fists. “All of you, wait outside.” Jade auras\nhumming with suspicion, the other Green Bones in the room\nreluctantly withdrew, although Hilo had no doubt they were\nlurking just out of sight and would return in less than a second\nif they so much as Perceived him sneezing aggressively.\nThe Pillar of the Mountain crossed her arms expectantly.\nShe was wearing a gray woolen dress and a long black scarf\nthat covered the puckered scar on her neck. Ayt never hid the\ndisfigurement of her left ear, which she had sustained in battle\nwith Shae, but ever since the Janloon bombing, she’d\nconcealed the reminder of how one second of carelessness had\nnearly ended her life.\nHilo came straight to the point. “Shae’s a prisoner of the\nFaltas barukan. They captured her, my wife, and two of my\nFists in Leyolo City.”\nAyt showed no surprise. The clans had kept a close watch\non each other’s activities for so long that by now the Mountain\nsurely knew something was amiss in No Peak. “I had nothing\nto do with it,” Ayt replied. “Your Weather Man took a risk by\ngoing into Shotar and making enemies of the barukan. What\ndid you expect? Although, I hear your wife is already safely\nback in Janloon. You must’ve paid dearly for her return, but\nsurely you have even more jade and money to offer to the\nFaltas, to secure the release of your Weather Man.”"

You must’ve paid dearly for her return, but\nsurely you have even more jade and money to offer to the\nFaltas, to secure the release of your Weather Man.”\nHilo said, “Their demands are a ploy. They let Wen go to\nmake me believe they’re sincere, but they’re not. They’ve\nalready killed one of my Fists. After they get everything they\nwant, they have no reason to return Shae alive.”\n“Because you will surely slaughter them, regardless of\nwhether they return her or not,” Ayt pointed out. “Not that I\ndisagree. I would do the same in your situation.”\nHilo paced slowly toward his old enemy. “I have to ask\nmyself,” he said thoughtfully, “why would these barukan pig\nfuckers take such a big risk? Why aren’t they afraid of what\nI’m going to do to them? They must have some reason for\nbelieving that they’ll be protected. That reason, Ayt-jen, has to\nbe you.”\n“I’ve already told you I had nothing to do with it,” Ayt said\nimpatiently. Her glare warned Hilo to remain where he was.\n“You can Perceive I’m not lying to you.”\n“You may not have planned or ordered it,” Hilo said,\ncoming to a halt, “but you’re still the reason. The Faltas gang\nworks for your allies, the Matyos, but I’m guessing they’re\ntired of being in second place and want to move up. If they get\nvaluable information out of Shae that benefits all the barukan,\nthey can count on the Matyos to keep them safe.” Hilo’s back\nteeth came together, flexing the line of his jaw. “They’ll mail\nyou Shae’s head in a box, expecting your approval and\nprotection as well. So when I peel back everything, you’re still\nthe reason why my sister will be dead in a few days.”\nAyt blew out a soft chuckle, as if she’d solved a simple\npuzzle. “So you’ve come here to tell me that if your Weather\nMan dies at the hands of some opportunistic barukan criminals\nin Leyolo City, you’ll blame me and wage war against the\nMountain?”\n“No,” Hilo said. “I’ve come to ask for your help.”\nFor the first time in Hilo’s memory, Ayt Mada was too\nsurprised to give an immediate reply. She stared at him for\nsome time. “Why on earth and under Heaven,” she asked with\nthe slow, deliberate rasp of drawing a rusted blade, “would I\nhelp the man who stood by when I had a knife in my neck,\nhappily watching me die?”\n“You would’ve gladly done the same if it were me,” Hilo\nsaid. “I should have you killed where you stand right now,”\nAyt declared.\n“After you’re dead, the barukan will kill your sister, and\nthat will be the end of the Kauls. The end of this long and\nhateful war between the clans, with the Mountain victorious.”\n“You could do that,” Hilo admitted. “At least, you could\ntry.

I’m in your\nhouse, unarmed and surrounded by your Fists and Fingers, so\nit wouldn’t be much of a fight, but I like to think I could still\ndo some damage going out.”\nHilo’s voice did not rise or fall, but it hardened to a sharp\npoint. “After I fail to come out of your house, my cousin\nAnden, who’s sitting outside in the car, will leave here and\nwalk into the offices of the Janloon Daily and in front of KNB\ncameras to explain exactly what happened on the day of the\nJanloon bombing. The entire country will know that Kaul\nShaelinsan saved your life when no one else would—and you\nrepaid her by murdering me and letting her die in a foreign\ncountry at the hands of barukan scum.”\n“Ah yes, I’ll be lambasted and condemned in the press,”\nAyt scoffed. “They’ll call me vile names. I’ll suffer poor\npublic relations for a while. All things I’ve endured before,\nand a small price to pay for the immeasurable satisfaction of\nyour death.”\n“Even now?” Hilo asked quietly. “When people can look\nto the Koben family?”\nAyt’s expression lost only a touch of its confident scorn,\nbut her jade aura swelled and bristled—evidence enough that\nwhat he said had struck a nerve of truth. It had become well\nknown in Green Bone circles that Ayt Mada and her adoptive\nnephew’s family were not always in alignment. Right now,\nCouncilwoman Koben Tin Bett was cosponsoring a bill in the\nRoyal Council that would ban further immigration from\nShotar, even though her Pillar had remained silent on the issue,\nso as not to jeopardize the Mountain’s alliance with the\nMatyos.\nTimes had changed. Ayt Madashi was in her sixties and no\nlonger viewed as indispensable to the Mountain clan. With a\nstrong, popular thirty-year-old man waiting to succeed her as\nPillar, she needed the complete confidence of her clan if she\nwas to remain in power. She would make compromises she\nmight not have considered earlier in her reign in order to\nuphold her leadership and delay the inevitable rise of her own\nheir.\nJust like Grandda, Hilo thought.\nNevertheless, Hilo could read the black calculation in\nAyt’s eyes, one that he could entirely understand: Perhaps it\nwould be worth any risk, to finally win. “After all these years,”\nshe intoned with all her usual cold scorn, “is there anything\nyou believe I won’t do if I have to?”\n“No,” Hilo replied. “I half expected you’d kill me as soon\nas I walked in the door. But you didn’t, which means my\nsuspicions were right.” His stare was steady and honest.\n“You’re not a machine after all. As much as you’d like to see\nme feeding worms, you would feel something after the Faltas\ntorture Shae to death for information that they’ll sell to you. I\ndon’t know what kind of a human being can imagine facing\nthe gods with that on their soul—and we’re all human, even\nyou.”\nHe saw the nearly imperceptible shift in her posture—a"

Hilo lowered his voice. “You have far more\nmen on the ground in Shotar than I do. You have power over\nthe Matyos. You can intervene. You can condemn the Faltas. If\nthe men who took Shae realize they have no one to defend\nthem, that we’ll hunt them like animals, then the situation\nbecomes very different for them.”\nWith long strides, Ayt walked to the window and looked\nout at her garden with the willow trees drooping over the\ngazebo. “I don’t control the Matyos,” she said, her back to\nhim. “I’ve allied with them when it’s been advantageous, but\nthey’re not a clan. They’re not truly Kekonese. They’re\nbarukan. They may decide they don’t care whether I approve\nof their actions or not and choose to side with the Faltas.”\nHilo came up behind her, stopping at the point where their\njade auras scraped against each other like shelves of granite\nalong a fault line. “The Ayt Madashi that I know doesn’t take\nno for an answer, not from anyone. Those who do stand in her\nway”—Hilo opened his hands in self-indication as he stood in\nher foyer—“have to be ready to die. It’s why you’re the only\none in the world who can help me right now. The gods have\nalways had a sick sense of humor.”\nAyt let out a soft derisive laugh and touched the scarf\naround her neck. She turned to face him. “In that regard, Kaul-\njen, you and I are in complete agreement.”\n“After all these years,” Hilo said, repeating Ayt’s own\nwords, “is there anything you believe I won’t do if I have to?”\nWith the grim dignity of a man stepping up to the\nexecutioner’s blade, Hilo lowered himself to his knees in front\nof the adversary he’d spent decades of his life trying to\ndestroy. “Help me find my sister and bring her back to Janloon\nalive. Your debt will be repaid—a life for a life. Whatever\nhappens between you and me in the future, we’ll call that fair.\nShotar will be yours completely. I’ll pull No Peak out of the\ncountry and leave it to the Mountain for as long as I am\nPillar.” Hilo touched his clasped hands to his head in salute. “I\nswear this to you, Ayt Madashi, Pillar of the Mountain.

It was never\nenough, of course—small doses that temporarily abated the\nworst of the physical agony, keeping her lucid and preventing\nher from falling headlong into the madness of the Itches. The\nshort barukan leader with the green skull pendant bent over\nher and removed the gag that kept her screams muffled. She\nhad never hated anyone in the world more than she hated him.\nNot Ayt Mada, not Zapunyo, not anyone.\n“Give me names,” he said again. “The names of your\nWhite Rats.”\n“I’ve already told you what I know,” Shae rasped. Even\nher tongue felt hot and swollen. She wanted to writhe on the\nfloor, to claw at her face—anything to alleviate the feeling of\nheat bubbling under the surface of her skin. When she was\ninside the tub, at least there was the almost transcendent\ndelirium of jade energy. Lying on the ground in chains, she\ndidn’t even have the strength to lift her head off the floor.\n“You’ve only told us some of the cops and officials we\nalready know are in your pocket. You’ll have to do much\nbetter than that,” her tormentor said regretfully.\nWhen Shae didn’t answer, the barukan sighed and\nmotioned for the men wearing the lead gloves to lift her back\ninto the tub. Shae twisted and gasped, “Wait, please! I’ll tell\nyou, if you give some of the shine to him.” She looked at\nDudo. The Fist was dying. Having already suffered a head\ninjury, he was in no way able to bear the lethal level of jade\noverexposure. When Shae was in the tub, even through her\nown throes she could Perceive Dudo’s heart intermittently\nracing out of control, then crashing to dangerously low levels.\nShe’d been forced to watch him scream and thrash, vomit and\nconvulse, but after that ceased, he was deathly still, barely\nbreathing.\n“The bastard snapped my friend’s neck.” The barukan\nleader poked Dudo experimentally. The Fist did not move at\nall. “If you really want me to use up my expensive shine on\nhim, you’ll have to give me something that’s actually\nvaluable.”\nThey were going to die anyway. She had the blood of so\nmany on her hands already, what were a few more? “The\nsecond captain of the Matyos—” she began.\n“Hannito?” one of the men in the room exclaimed. “I don’t\nbelieve it.”\n“Not him,” she said. “His younger brother, the\ndeliveryman.”\nSomeone nearby let out a curse. “That fucker’s dead\nmeat.”\nThe barukan leader leaned in eagerly now. “Is that true?\nWho else?”\n“You know I’m not lying,” Shae said hoarsely. “Give Dudo\nthe shine.”\nThe man looked over at one of his subordinates and\nshrugged, as if to say, Why not? He’s going to die anyway. The\nthick-lipped second-in-command took out a syringe and\nemptied the contents into Dudo’s arm.

A few seconds after\nthe shine went into his bloodstream, the man jerked and began\nto breathe more steadily—a sign of life at least.\n“Other names,” the barukan demanded.\nShae gave up another White Rat—the wife of a gang\nleader—and couldn’t even muster the will to wonder what\nwould happen to the woman. When she didn’t cough up any\nadditional names, however, they put her back into the tub.\nAfter a while, they took her out again, gave her another dose\nof SN2, and asked her more questions. The process took on a\ncertain familiar predictability. How slowly could she offer up\ninformation in exchange for enough shine to stay sane and\nalive?\nWhenever she was in the tub, she wanted to give up. She\nwas drowning in jade energy the way a person might drown in\ntheir own blood. It was impossible to describe the feeling.\nEvery particle of her being was boiling over and the only way\nher primitive nervous system could interpret the sensation was\nitching. Itching in the soles of her feet and the palms of her\nhands, itching on the inside of her legs and down her arms and\nall over her scalp, itching inside her mouth, on her eyeballs.\nShe understood now why the disease drove people mad, why\nthey mutilated themselves and threw themselves into the sea.\nShae forgot who she was and wanted only to die.\nBut when they gave her shine, she would come back to\nherself for long enough to think, I have to give Hilo time. Hilo\nwould find them. He would not be fooled by the barukan’s\nploys. If there was anything she had faith in besides the gods,\nit was her brother’s cunning vindictiveness. So every moment\nshe was lucid enough to think, she prayed silently and\nfervently, Yatto, Father of All, help me, help my brother.\nShe had to live. She would not leave Woon to raise Tia\nalone. She refused to fail her gentle daughter in the way that\nGreen Bone parents too often failed their children, the way her\nfather had failed her before she was born, the way Lan had\nfailed Niko, and Anden’s mother had failed him—by dying.\nDrowning in blood and jade.\n“What is the Euman Deal? Tell us about the Euman Deal.”\nThis was new. She hadn’t heard this question before, at\nleast she didn’t think she had, although it was getting harder\nand harder to remember. They’d moved her to the living room\nat some point and dumped her in an armchair, her limbs still\ntightly bound. It must be nighttime; no glimmer of light\nbordered the covered windows. The faces in front of her swam\nin her warped vision. Moving mouths seemed to stretch in\nslow motion like those of grinning demons, melting like hot\nwax, grotesque and abstract. Someone slapped her face. Her\nhead lolled back and her tongue protruded.\n“Give her some more,” the barukan leader said. More\nshine.

When the private plane carrying the Horn and a dozen\nother carefully chosen No Peak Green Bones landed in Leyolo\nCity, the information was waiting for them, along with a\ncontingent of Mountain Green Bones who’d been tasked to\nhelp in the search.\nReconnaissance on all seven of the addresses was\nconducted via drive-bys at a cautious distance. Vin doubted\nany Keko-Shotarian barukan would have the training to\nPerceive farther away than the length of a relayball court, but\nthey would certainly have sentries patrolling around their\nposition. Tato, whose talent in Perception was second only to\nVin’s, thought she sensed the Weather Man inside one of the\nhouses. Vin confirmed that it did feel like Kaul Shae’s aura,\nalthough it was flaring erratically and he could not be\ncompletely sure it was her. Photographs of the building were\ntaken from a distance and the images faxed back to Janloon.\nWen hadn’t seen the outside of the house, but she could\ndescribe the size and layout of the main floor based on what\nshe was able to remember. It aligned with the shape of the\nhouse Vin was now concentrating on.\nAll evidence told Vin they had the right place. Eyes closed,\nfinger on the trigger, breathing as lightly and steadily as\npossible, he could sense the different jade auras inside the\nhouse vibrating with strong emotion: fear, pain, anger,\nurgency. From this distance, they were like colored tea lights\ndancing in his Perception. Fortunately, the walls were merely\nstucco and insulated drywall, not brick or concrete, but he had\nno way of knowing how thick the windows were, or if there\nwas furniture in the way that would stop a rifle bullet or\nchange its trajectory. Ideally, his target would be directly in\nfront of a wall or window. And the timing of the whole\noperation had to be perfect. As soon as the first shot went off,\nthe men inside would know they’d been found. They would\nkill the prisoners unless Lott and the other Green Bones in the\ncar arrived in seconds.\nVin’s hands were steady, but beads of sweat ran down his\nforehead and over his closed eyelids. He blotted out the energy\nof every other living thing around him and narrowed his\nPerception until it seemed he was stretching his senses down a\nvery long tunnel. Don’t fuck this up.\nIn his headset, the Horn’s voice spoke to everyone. “We\nmove on Vin’s signal.”\n“Something’s changed,” Vin whispered. At this point, one\nof the jade auras was so weak he was quite sure it was near\ndeath. Another wasn’t much better, flickering and blinking in"

Another wasn’t much better, flickering and blinking in\nand out like a bad light bulb. The four others, however, which\nhad already been vibrating with unusual stress, now flared\nwith extreme agitation and hostility. People were moving\naround, slipping in and out of Vin’s narrow field of fire. The\nFist drew a bead on the strongest, most energetic jade aura he\ncould Perceive. As his finger curled over the trigger, he sensed\nhis target’s energy turn murderously dark.\n“Go, now!” Vin hissed into the radio. He exhaled, held his\nbreath, and fired.\n_______\nWhen the phone rang, the barukan were startled. They looked\nat each other as if questioning who among them was expecting\na call. “Who the fuck—” The man with the jade nose ring\nstomped into another room and answered the phone. The\nothers waited. They left Shae slumped and gasping in the\nliving room chair where they’d been interrogating her. When\nthe phone clicked off and the man came back, the blood had\ngone out of his face. “That was Choyulo,” he said numbly.\n“He said the Matyos have turned on us. He said we have to let\nthese Green Bones go and get out of here.”\nStunned silence. Then the short leader exploded. “Does he\nthink this is some sort of fucking video game? That we can hit\n‘erase’ and start over? Choyulo said the Matyos would have\nour back if we got heat from Janloon, and now he’s saying\nthey’re going to fuck us over? After we lost four guys? What\nthe fuck?”\nThe barukan broke into heated argument punctuated with\nshouted Shotarian and profanities. Shae struggled feebly to\nunderstand what was going on.\n“If the Matyos have sold us out to No Peak, we’re worse\nthan dead.” The young man with the neck tattoo swallowed\nnoisily. “We better do what Choyulo says.”\n“Fuck Choyulo,” the leader shouted, eyes bulging from his\nhead. “And fuck the Matyos! I’m sick of being second to those\nOortokon pussies. None of them could’ve pulled this off. Once\nthey know about the information we’ve got, they’d be out of\ntheir fucking minds not to back us up. Otherwise, we go\nstraight to Ayt Mada and the Mountain.”\n“What if Ayt’s in on it too? What if she turns us over to the\nKauls?” the man with the nose ring murmured, his eyes\nstarting to dart back and forth fearfully.\n“She wouldn’t do that, she hates the Kauls.” The lead\nbarukan crossed over to the closed window and pushed down\non the slats of the aluminum blinds, creating a tiny crack\nthrough which he peered out onto the empty, moonlit street\nwith narrowed eyes. Satisfied that all the guards were still in\nplace, he turned back to his men with a fearsome glare. “We’re\nall in this together, so none of you can turn chickenshit now,\nyou hear?

We’re going to get out of the city\nfirst. Then we’ll bargain with the Matyos.”\n“What about her?” asked the young man with the tattoo,\nlooking at Shae.\nThe leader stared down at her. Shae saw the heartless\ncalculation made in a few seconds. He couldn’t expect mercy\neven if he let her go. She was more a liability than an asset\nnow and would slow them down. “We didn’t get everything\nwe wanted from this bitch, but we got enough,” he decided,\nand drew a knife to slit her throat.\nShae’s body seemed to move with a will of its own. In a\nfinal instinctive bid for survival, it flung itself forward like a\nsuffocating fish flopping on the deck of a boat toward the\nwater and the tiny chance of living. Shae crashed to the floor,\nknowing that her final spurt of defiance was useless, simply a\ntrapped animal response. She twisted onto her side, staring up\nwith mute hatred. The man with the knife snorted in\namusement at her struggles and took a step toward her—then\njerked and stumbled, as if he’d been punched in the back. The\nknife tumbled from his fingers to the carpet. Shae followed the\nmovement of his empty hand as he raised it in confusion to his\nchest, and then she saw the two exit wounds that had punched\nthrough his body, a pair of darkening flowers in the front of his\nblack T-shirt.\nThe other Faltas stared in disbelief as their captain’s body\nhit the floor with a thud. Then they broke into a panic, drawing\npistols and pointing them at the broken window as they dove\nbehind furniture and flattened themselves against walls. “They\nshot Batiyo!” someone screamed. “How the fuck did they\nshoot him?” The blinds and black plastic now worked against\nthem, obscuring their attackers.\n“Look outside the window,” the man with the nose ring\nordered.\n“You look outside,” someone else hissed, but he edged\nalong the wall toward the glass. Two more gunshots punched\nthrough the side of the house. Everyone ducked as the man by\nthe wall dropped to the ground shrieking, clutching his\nshoulder.\nThe front and back doors of the house burst open with\ntremendous noise as they were torn out of their frames. The\nlargest windows shattered inward from the force of Steeled\nbodies. Gunfire erupted as the Faltas unloaded their pistols at\nthe Green Bones crashing into the house without any pretense\nof restraint. Everything around Shae erupted in deafening\nviolence.\nShe blinked at the mayhem as if it were happening in a\ndream. The young gangster with the neck tattoo grabbed for\nher, trying to use her as a shield to save himself. Seizing the\nropes binding her, he began to drag her across the floor with\nhim, pointing his gun and screaming over the tumult, “Stay\naway or I’ll kill her, I swear I’ll—”\nShae writhed frantically, catching the man in the shin with\na flailing kick that made him yelp with pain.

He lost his grip\nfor a moment and reached down to seize her again, but the\nhand with the gun came off his arm and spun end over end.\nThe moon blade that had severed it flashed back around and\nsank into the space between the young man’s neck and\nshoulder, opening his torso with a meaty diagonal cleaving.\nShae made a muffled noise as his blood sprayed across her\nhair.\nA final gunshot reverberated elsewhere in the house and\nthen the fighting was abruptly over. Lott Jin’s face appeared\nover Shae, breathing hard. He was wearing a bulletproof vest\nand his moon blade was streaked, glistening red. Sweat\nplastered his wavy hair to his forehead. The Horn dropped\ndown to his knees and broke the padlock on her restraints.\n“Shae-jen,” he said hoarsely as he unwound the chains.\n“Thank the gods in Heaven.”\nTears filled Shae’s eyes at the sight of Lott’s face. On\nweakened arms, she tried to push herself up into a sitting\nposition, but couldn’t manage it; her entire body was shaking\nwith violent relief. “Are they dead?” she asked. “All of them?”\nShe was thinking of the safety of all the White Rats whose\nnames she’d surrendered.\n“All of them, Shae-jen,” Lott reassured her. “We’ll get\neveryone responsible.”\nTwo Green Bones that Shae didn’t recognize appeared next\nto Lott and helped him to cut the ropes off her raw, bruised\nwrists, then her arms and legs. They brought over a stretcher\nand lifted her carefully onto it. Shae was too weak to protest\nthe gentle treatment as they carried her out of the house that\nhad been her prison for days. She gasped at the shock of cold\nair and the sight of so many Green Bones moving about under\nthe orange streetlights. Where had all these people come from?\nShe knew some of them, but other faces were unfamiliar.\n“Kaul-jen,” said one of the strangers, inclining his chin and\ntouching his forehead as he helped her into the back of a car.\n“Ayt Madashi sends her regards.”\n_______\nA month after the ordeal, Shae was still unable to wear jade.\nWeeks of being treated with high doses of medical-grade SN2\nhad cured her of the Itches, but the first time Woon had\nwrapped his arms around her, she’d cringed merely from the\nnearness of her own husband’s jade. Anden assured her that\nevery examination showed she was physically recovered, but\nwith tears in his eyes he told her that her body might never\ntolerate wearing green the way it used to. As the one member\nof the family who knew better than anyone what is was like to\nbe scarred by jade overexposure, he explained that it was not\nso much a physical issue as a psychological one.

Dudo had survived,\nmiraculously defying all odds, but he was deeply damaged; he\nwould likely need antipsychotic medication and therapy for\nyears if not the rest of his life, and he would never wear jade\nagain. Wen visited the unfortunate man and his family every\nweek.\nNo Peak’s foray into Shotar had been a disaster, a loss of\nyears of work in the course of three days. They did eke out a\nfew final satisfactions. With the Mountain’s support, No\nPeak’s Fists remained in Leyolo City for another two weeks,\nlong enough to find and kill another thirty-two members of the\nFaltas, wiping out the entire upper echelon of the country’s\nsecond-largest barukan group in a spree of unstinting violence\nthat the police ignored as an outbreak of ethnic gang conflict.\nShortly afterward, Wen received word that Diamond Light\nMotion Pictures had agreed to release Danny Sinjo from his\ncontract so he could star in Cinema Shore’s tentpole feature\nfilm, Black & Green.\nOne evening, as Shae sat with Hilo in the courtyard of the\nKaul estate after the sun had gone down, she asked him, “Have\nyou ever heard of the Euman Deal?”\nHe shook his head. “What is it?”\nShae frowned. “Something I heard. Maybe nothing. I don’t\nknow yet.” Without her jade senses, the garden seemed oddly\nlessened, like a washed-out painting, and being near Hilo\nwithout being able to Perceive his aura was strange. She\nstudied his face, wondering if it was even more peculiar for\nhim, to see her once again, after so many years, without any\njade at all. For the first time, she noticed flecks of silver in her\nbrother’s hair.\n“What did Ayt promise the Matyos, to gain their\ncooperation?” she asked.\n“She killed the proposed immigration ban.” Hilo put his\nfeet up on an empty chair. “She sent word to the Mountain\nloyalists in the Royal Council that they were to make sure the\nbill was voted down.”\nShae nodded. The defeat of the legislation ensured the\nborder would remain porous between Kekon and Shotar. The\nbarukan could continue to travel freely between the countries,\nsending their relatives to Kekon to work legally or illegally.\nThat was something the Matyos would value above any\nalliance with the Faltas gang.\n“The Kobens must’ve been livid.” Councilwoman Koben\nTin Bett was one of the most outspoken proponents of the\nwidely popular view that Oortokon refugees had increased\ncrime in Kekon and barukan immigrants eroded traditional\nGreen Bone values. Now, her own Pillar had scuttled the\nlegislation she’d been advancing in the Royal Council. Shae\nwas pleased the isolationist measure had failed, but seeing the\nshrewd old widow being so plainly put in her place, she\ncouldn’t help but feel a bit sorry for her.\n“What can the Kobens do?” Hilo said with a shrug. “As\nlong as their boy is a Pillar-in-waiting, they can’t afford to get\non Ayt’s bad side too much. It was the same with Lan and"

You didn’t see it up close the way I did.” Shae\nwaited for an accusatory glance to come her way, but it didn’t.\nHilo was staring off into the distance. “Ayt can control the\nKobens as long as she has other options. I’m sure the Iwe\nfamily hasn’t given up hope that she’ll pass the leadership on\nto her Weather Man.”\n“Ayt Mada won’t be quietly stepping into retirement.”\n“No,” Hilo agreed, turning his eyes slowly toward her.\n“Overall, I don’t think she’s unhappy with how things turned\nout.” The alliance with the Matyos renewed, the Kobens back\nunder her heel, the Shotarian market under sole Mountain\ncontrol.\nAnd Ayt’s debt to the Kaul family erased. Shae knew what\nsaving her life had cost Hilo in his soul. She’d never doubted\nher brother’s ability to take lives or to give his own for the\nclan. She’d never imagined he would go on his knees to beg\nhis worst enemy for help. In his mind, it would’ve been a\nbetrayal of all the Fists and Fingers who’d fought for him and\ngiven their lives under his leadership. She thought about\nsaying something, voicing an acknowledgment of what he’d\ndone—but the idea of putting such feelings into words\nbetween them seemed trite, distancing, even insulting. They\nsat in silence.\nAfter a time, Hilo asked, “What will you do, if you can’t\nwear jade again?”\nShae touched her bare wrists, unsure how to answer. She\nthought of Tia, asleep in her bed, and of the simple, profound\njoy that existed in seeing her daughter’s face and hugging her\ntight. Having nearly been deprived of that, she couldn’t muster\nany great regret over the loss of her jade. During her life, she’d\nearned plenty of green, taken it off, reclaimed it, lost much of\nit in combat. Jade was her armor and her weapon, but it was\nnot a part of her, the way it was with Hilo. She missed her\nabilities, but she was not empty, not any less of a person than\nshe would’ve been if she’d lost an arm or a leg or an eye.\nIt was strange, Shae thought—Green Bones revered jade,\nbut it was not the gems themselves that were worthy of\nreverence. Jade had meaning because of the type of person one\nhad to become to wear it. Jade was the visible proof that a\nperson had dedicated their life to the discipline of wielding\npower, to the dangers and costs of being a Green Bone.\nShe did not require proof anymore. She was past needing\nto carry her green as a coveted mark of status and credibility,\none that declared to everyone that she was equal to her\nbrothers and worthy of being a Kaul. She had two decades on\nthe top floor of Ship Street to do that for her. She had work to\ndo now, to rebuild from their losses, to guide the clan and the\ncountry toward growth and progress, to keep it safe from\noutside threats but also from the perils of its own worst\nimpulses.\n“What will I do?” she asked quietly, turning to her brother"

As Weather Man of No Peak.”\nCHAPTER\n49\nThe Prince’s Stand\nthe twenty-second year, twelfth month\nF\nor Ru’s birthday, his friend Dano invited him to a party in\nthe Dog’s Head district. “It’s at this place called the Little\nPersimmon, and it’s going to be a great crowd,” he told Ru as\nthey walked to class. “You should come. These guys I know\nreally want to meet you.”\n“Really?” Ru wasn’t accustomed to getting any attention\non his own, but he guessed that with Niko and Jaya gone from\nJanloon, he was the only one of the younger Kauls to take\nnotice of now.\n“Sure!” Dano insisted. “Anyway, keke, you could stand to\ncut loose a bit.”\nRu supposed his friend was right. Midterm exams were\naround the corner, and Ru had been studying until late into the\nnight for weeks to catch up. His third-year classes were more\ndifficult and there had been a lot of stress in his life over the\npast year. The terrifying abduction of his mother and his aunt\nhad caused him to miss classes right at the beginning of the\nschool year. That summer, Typhoon Kitt, the worst typhoon in\nthirty years to hit the East Amaric region, had pelted Janloon\nfor three days, causing enormous damage. Jan Royal campus\nhad been closed for a week, and even after it reopened, Ru had\nspent all his time outside of classes helping with the No Peak\nclan’s clean-up and relief efforts. The latest problem was that\nhis dog Koko was going deaf and blind in old age, and had\nseveral teeth removed last month after difficulties eating. Ru\ntried to go home every weekend to see him.\nOn top of everything else, Ru was torn about what to do\nwhen he graduated next year. He’d decided to major in public\npolicy. Time spent living on campus away from the clan and\ngetting to know the other students in the Charitable Society for\nJade Nonreactivity had cemented a realization that he’d been\nborn as the luckiest stone-eye in the country. Sometimes he\nfelt like a walking paradox, possessing all the privileges of\nbeing a son in a ruling Green Bone family despite his\ndeficiency, and suffering few of the indignities that other\nnonreactive people experienced, especially the Abukei. It\nseemed only right that he consider how he could use his\nposition to help others.\nRu thought he might like to work for a nonprofit\norganization, with a goal of getting involved in political\nadvocacy, but he wasn’t sure his father would approve. When\nhe was in a good mood, the Pillar was receptive to Ru’s ideas,\nbut at other times he would respond impatiently. “You’re too\nidealistic, son. No Peak is a Green Bone clan, not a charity\nhouse.” After the disastrous loss of the office in Shotar, the\nmost pressing need was on the business side of the clan.

The Weather Man had\nalready suggested she would be pleased to have him on Ship\nStreet, and Ru’s mother had reminded him sternly, “You have\nto put your family first, before you think to help strangers.”\nRu decided to take Dano’s suggestion and blow off some\nsteam. The Little Persimmon being in Mountain territory gave\nhim a moment’s pause, but he was twenty-one years old now\nand not about to inform his parents of every minor risk he took\nby crossing clan district boundaries like an ordinary adult.\nWhen he arrived at the address Dano had given to him, he\nwent up to the second floor and found the lounge to be a dive,\nwith dim lighting, red benches around a small dance floor,\nscratched wooden tables, and a black bar with mini-lights\nstrung behind a mirrored backsplash.\nDano excitedly brought him over to meet a lean, sharp-\nfaced man working behind the bar. “Tadino here didn’t believe\nme when I said I knew you.” Dano tapped the bar top. “Pay up\non that bet, keke!”\nThe man named Tadino leaned closer. “Are you really\nKaul Rulinshin?” He had an accent—Shotarian?—and to Ru’s\nsurprise, a circular burn scar on his left cheek.\nRu dug out his driver’s license and showed it to the man,\nwho laughed and said, “I’ll be damned. All right, Dano, I’ll\npay you in free drinks.” He poured them each a generous shot\nof hoji and touched his forehead to Ru in salute. When he\ngrinned, his puckered scar stretched and pulled at the corner of\nhis eye. “I’ve always wanted to meet one of the Kauls in\nperson. You could even say I’m a bit of a clanmag addict.”\nThe comment made Ru dislike the man. The cheap, trashy\nmagazines that printed clan gossip and photos of Green Bones\nhad been unkind to Niko. Although, to be fair, they were\nunflattering to everyone, even Ayt Ato. Clanmag\nphotographers had had their camera equipment smashed,\nvehicles set on fire, and even bones broken by irate Green\nBones, but apparently the money was good enough for them to\ncontinue their activities. Tadino didn’t notice Ru’s grimace. He\nprodded another man sitting at the bar, a pale, sullen fellow\nwith a crooked face who was presumably a regular at the Little\nPersimmon, as he was alone and studying his half-empty\ndrink. “Hey, you hear that?” Tadino said. “This is the Pillar’s\nson, show some respect.”\nThe unsmiling man glanced at Ru and warily touched his\nforehead before returning to his beverage. Tadino was not\ndone; he shouted above the music and waved a young woman\nover to the bar. “Juni, guess who this is,” he exclaimed.\nThe woman’s thin, tattooed eyebrows rose under the fringe\nof her straight bangs and her full red lips parted in\nappreciation. “Tadino, this shitty bar is more cut than I gave\nyou credit for.

It extended assistance\nto refugees. “Tadino’s from Oortoko. He used to be in a\nbarukan gang and he’s been through some rough times in his\nlife.”\nRu said, “Do you know why he was branded?”\n“Don’t tell me you believe in that barbaric policy,” Dano\nexclaimed. “Green Bones have branded thousands of innocent\npeople for having foreign blood, or an accent, or for simply\nbeing in the wrong place at the wrong time. It’s heinous.”\n“I’m not saying I agree with it.” Ru wanted to point out\nthat Dano was as usual generalizing about Green Bones. The\nenthusiasm for branding people suspected of anti-clan\nactivities was driven by one large faction in the Mountain clan\nand not uniformly followed even by all of the Mountain’s own\nFists. But that wasn’t the point. Dano was so outspoken and\nrighteous, so quick to see every branded person as having been\nwronged that Ru was concerned his friend would one day be\ncaught with actual clanless criminals and, through no fault of\nhis own, end up with a red-hot pipe against his face, or worse.\n“You have to think of yourself,” he insisted. “You could find\nyourself in the wrong place at the wrong time, too—and with\nthe wrong sort of people.” Ru had not forgotten that his own\nsister had been ready to assume the worst about Dano, even to\nbring his name up to Lott Jin.\n“Don’t worry about me, keke. Just have a good time, all\nright?” Dano pulled out a small plastic bag of black powder.\n“Hey, you want to do some sand?” When Ru shook his head,\nDano shrugged and said, “Let’s get you another drink, then.”\nReluctantly, Ru dropped the subject, though not before\nresolving to talk to Dano about it again, some other time.\nTonight it would only ruin the mood; they were here to enjoy\nthemselves after all. He asked for another hoji, this time with\nice and a splash of anise.\nOn the dance floor, there were plenty of pretty girls, but\nJuni was the most striking, in a short black skirt and tall nylon\nboots. The plunging neckline of her sequined tank top showed\noff a tattoo on her chest, a black arrow pointed straight down\ninto her cleavage.

She slid her leg\nin between his, pressing the top of her thigh against his\nwarming crotch as they ground their bodies together in the\ndark.\nRu was a little embarrassed by how excited he was that\nthis beautiful woman was throwing herself at him. He\nsuspected that Niko and Jaya got laid more often than he did,\nand while he’d never envied the social climbing advances his\nsiblings had to put up with, he still wondered, sometimes\njealously, what it would be like to enjoy all the advantages of\nhis family name. To have status as soon as you walked into a\nroom. To have women want you. To carry the greenness of an\nentire clan and thus always be more than yourself. That’s what\nit would be like, he decided, to be a true prince of No Peak.\nNiko and Jaya took their place for granted, but Ru didn’t.\nWhen the perks occasionally did come his way, why shouldn’t\nhe enjoy them to the fullest? Juni’s breasts pressed against him\nand the scent of her perfumed sweat filled his nostrils and rose\nup into his brain. Ru moved his hands down her back, over her\nwaist, onto her buttocks.

Juni wrapped her arms around his neck and\nthe warmth of her cheek tingled against his. Her lips brushed\nhis ear. “Come on, I want to show you something.”\nTaking him by the hand, she pulled him off the dance floor.\nRu looked around for Dano, catching a glimpse of his friend\non one of the red benches with two others, snorting sand off a\ntray. Giggling, Juni led him around the side of the bar, where,\nto Ru’s surprise, behind a purple curtain there was another\nroom with a couple of sofas and mirrors hung all over the\nwalls so that whichever way he turned, he saw flushed, bright-\neyed reflections of himself.\n“Wow, a secret room,” Ru said, grinning. “I wonder why\nit’s here?”\n“Who cares?” Juni grabbed him and they kissed, their\ncolliding mouths hot and hungry. She tasted of vanilla lip gloss\nand lychee rum soda. “No one is going to bother us here.”\n_______\n“Stay here by the bar and make sure they don’t leave,” Tadino\nhissed to Bero. “I’m going to run outside and make the phone\ncall. Just keep an eye on things.”\n“I’m not going to stand here and listen to those kids\nfucking,” Bero said sourly. Most of tonight’s young crowd in\nthe Little Persimmon was blissfully drunk or high. A few were\npassed out on the benches, and others were slipping out of the\nlounge in pairs. But Tadino had only let Bero have one drink.\n“We’ve got to stay cut,” he insisted. “Tonight, we’re going to\nstart the next clan war and turn everything around.”"

But Tadino had only let Bero have one drink.\n“We’ve got to stay cut,” he insisted. “Tonight, we’re going to\nstart the next clan war and turn everything around.”\nTadino rushed out to the pay phone on the street to call\nKoben Ashi and inform him that his girlfriend was at the Little\nPersimmon lounge and some stranger was laying his filthy\nhands all over her. Koben Ashi, a mid-rank Fist in the\nMountain clan, son of a prominent councilwoman and a close\ncousin of Ayt Ato, was a jealous bastard who would beat the\nshit out of any man who so much as looked at his woman for\ntoo long. According to Juni, she and Ashi were broken up at\nthe moment, but apparently Ashi never got these notices.\nEvery man in the Mountain clan knew Juni was a poisonous\nflower and wouldn’t touch her, which was why she sought\nother places to fool around. She didn’t seem to mind that Ashi\nput her conquests in the hospital, and in fact, she was always\nback together with him shortly thereafter.\nBero had to hand it to Tadino—it was a wildly unlikely but\nclever setup, the sort of risky thing that Bero himself might’ve\ncome up with when he was younger. As a bartender, Tadino\nmet a lot of people and heard a lot of gossip about both clans.\nHe’d seen Juni at the Little Persimmon before, and when he\ndiscovered that he knew a college kid who was personal\nfriends with Kaul Ru, he’d come up with a plan to put the\npieces together.\n“We’ve been stepped on like shit for long enough,” Tadino\nsaid. They had to fight back, to do something about the\nrelentless persecution heaped on them by the clans. Starting a\nwildfire of clan violence would relieve the pressure. It would\nallow the CFM to regroup and recover.\nBero approved of the scheme, but he still had doubts. Over\nthe years, he’d taken every possible run at the Green Bones.\nHe was a killer and a thief, a grave robber, a smuggler, spy,\nand terrorist. It was a wonder he was even alive. Did he have\nanything left in him to try again? He wanted to believe he did,\nthat his smoldering inner fire could be whipped up anew.\nOn the other hand, it would be a whole lot easier to stay\naway from it all and drink.\n“You don’t have to do anything,” Tadino pointed out. “You\njust have to keep those kids here and make sure no one\ninterrupts them. And then stay here as a witness. How about\nthat? You can fuck things up for the clans by barely lifting a\nfinger.”\nThat possibility was appealing enough to Bero that he\nagreed. Koben Ashi would arrive at the Little Persimmon and\nunknowingly hand the Pillar’s stone-eye son a savage beating.\nKaul Hilo was sure to respond with ferocious retaliation, and\nthe fragile cooperation the clans had maintained since the\nJanloon bombing would shatter.\nSince Tadino had closed down the bar and left it\nunattended, Bero helped himself to another glass of hoji.\nThrough a crack between the purple curtains, he could hear\nand see Juni and the Pillar’s son making out.

        "text": "unattended, Bero helped himself to another glass of hoji.\nThrough a crack between the purple curtains, he could hear\nand see Juni and the Pillar’s son making out. Juni’s skirt was\nhiked up to her hips, and the buttons of Kaul Ru’s shirt were\nundone. They were all over each other, oblivious to being\nsorely used by people they didn’t even know. Bero was\naccustomed to feeling sorry for himself, but sitting at the\nabandoned bar, listening to the wet smacking sounds and\nmoans of desire, he felt a pathetic kinship with the young man\nin the room next to him, whose uncle he’d opened fire on with\na Fullerton machine gun on a dark pier, a lifetime ago.\nAt the age of forty, Bero had come to the cynical\nconclusion that he’d always been a piece of detritus tossed\nabout on the tides of fortune. Good luck and bad luck were\ntwo sides of the same betting chip, thrown carelessly onto a\ncosmic games table to prolong the inscrutable amusement of\nthe gods. Yet he was not the only one the gods abused. Even\nthe Pillar’s son was a pawn to fate.\n“Hey, don’t be a pervert,” Juni called to Bero. “Close the\ncurtain, will you?”\nJuni’s short, sexy hair and her heart-shaped face reminded\nBero of Ema. Or maybe they seemed alike because she too\nwas leading a clueless man by his cock. Ema was long dead,\nblown to smithereens, but Bero still resented her. Now he\ndisliked Juni as well, just from looking at her. Ema had been a\nbitch to Bero, but she’d been nice sometimes, too. She’d let\nhim fuck her, if only because she was planning to die. When\nBero was very drunk, he thought maybe he missed her. Maybe\nhe even missed Sampa and Cheeky and Mudt.\nWhen Bero didn’t move, Kaul Ru got up, holding the top\nof his pants closed with one hand, and went to draw the curtain\nshut himself. Bero said, “She’s using you, keke.”\nThe young man had a flushed, stupid grin on his face.\n“Fine with me.”\n“You dumb kid, you think you’re calling the shots?” Bitter\ncontempt spilled thoughtlessly out of Bero’s mouth. Youthful,\nnaive, reckless confidence was something he’d once believed\nmade him special and would get him everything he ever\nwanted. “She has a boyfriend, that one. Koben Ashi, a Fist of\nthe Mountain.”\nKaul Ru paused with the curtain in his hand. He glanced\nback at Juni, then again at Bero as disbelief and then dawning\ncomprehension slackened his face. Bero sneered with savage\ndelight. “You’ve been set up, keke.”\nFootsteps pounded up the stairs and into the lounge. Koben\nAshi stormed past the few remaining partygoers, his head\nswiveling back and forth, his eyes wild with insensible fury.\nTwo of his Fingers were right behind him, as was Tadino, who\nshouted, “Back there, Kobenjen,” and pointed at the curtained\nroom by the bar.\nThe Fist pushed past Bero, yanked the curtain aside, and"

With a murderous curse, he seized\nKaul Ru by the throat and hurled him out of the room against\nthe bar.\n_______\nRu crashed into the bar top and fell, hitting his head against a\nbarstool on the way down. Sparks burst in his vision and a\nringing sound erupted in his ears. Dazed and crumpled on the\nsticky floor, his first, ridiculous thought was to fasten his pants\nbefore trying to get back up. He fumbled stupidly with the\nbutton and managed to do up his fly before Koben Ashi seized\nhim by the back of the collar, pulled him off the ground, and\nthrew him into another wall. Shouts of surprise and alarm\nbroke out. Most of the meager crowd still left in the Little\nPersimmon grabbed their belongings and ran for the exit stairs.\nThey knew how inadvisable it was to be anywhere near a\nfurious Green Bone.\n“Who do you think you are, touching my girl, you little\npiss rat?” Koben snarled. “After I’m done with your face,\nyou’ll never get laid again, fucker.”\nJuni stumbled out from behind the purple curtain, pulling\ndown her skirt and crying, dry-eyed, “Ashi, he’s just a kid, he\ndidn’t know any better. Don’t kill him!”\nRu staggered to his feet and raised his hands to defend\nhimself, but he couldn’t possibly match the jade-fueled speed\nof a Green Bone. Koben hit him in the stomach, doubling him\nover, then kicked him to the ground. Ru wheezed with pain,\nclutching his midsection. From the corner of his eye, he saw\nDano shouting and trying to wobble drunkenly to his defense,\nbut the bartender, Tadino, grabbed him by the arm and held\nhim back.\nI’m so stupid, Ru thought in agony. Stupid, stupid, stupid.\nStupid to trust Dano, stupid to come to this party in Mountain\nterritory and let down his guard, stupid to think for one second\nthat just because he was a stone-eye and the least of his\nfather’s children that he would be spared the attention of\nenemies.\nKoben grabbed a nearby barstool and snapped off one of\nthe wooden legs to use as a club with which to beat Ru\nunconscious. Koben’s two Fingers watched with slightly\nanxious but unsurprised expressions. One of them said, “Ashi-\njen, this kid isn’t even a Green Bone, he’s not worth it.”\nRu dove frantically out of the way as the chair leg came\nwhistling down. It missed his head and struck his shoulder. His\nentire arm went numb. They don’t know who I am, he realized.\nHis family had always kept him out of the spotlight and his\nface was not in the clanmags. He was barely known to anyone\noutside of No Peak circles, much less in the Mountain clan.\nThe man with the crooked face had been right—Ru had been\nset up. But so had the Koben family."

But so had the Koben family.\nRu threw himself behind a table. The enraged Fist kicked it\nout of the way and raised the chair leg again, but the obstacle\nhad finally given Ru the two seconds he needed to yank out\nthe compact talon knife he carried sheathed inside his rear\nwaistband. Koben’s eyes flicked down at the sudden\nappearance of a weapon, and in that moment of distraction, Ru\ncried out, “A clean blade!” He scrambled into a fighter’s\ncrouch, his talon knife held up in front of him, blood trickling\nfrom his nose. “My name is Kaul Rulinshin, son of the Pillar\nof No Peak, and I offer a clean blade!”\nKoben Ashi paused with the chair leg still raised. His eyes\nflicked from the talon knife to Ru’s face. The Fist’s cheek\ntwitched as he exchanged glances with his two Fingers, who\nstared at Ru with dubious astonishment.\nKoben swung his head back toward Ru with a growl.\n“Don’t be a fucking clown. The No Peak Pillar’s son in a place\nlike this?”\n“It’s true!” Dano babbled, finally breaking free of Tadino\nand stumbling forward. “He really is Kaul Ru. We came here\nto have a good time, that’s all! He hasn’t done anything wrong,\nhe didn’t know who she was. He’s just a stone-eye college\nkid!”\nKoben’s knuckles whitened around the chair leg. He\nwheeled on Juni. “You little whore, you found out he was a\nKaul and you couldn’t keep your legs closed? Are you trying\nto get me tangled up with No Peak, you bitch?”\nThe woman’s face lost all its color. “No, no, Ashi, I would\nnever …” She fell to her knees, crying for real now. “He came\non to me, and I was afraid to say no.”\n“That’s not true.” Ru’s eyes glittered with outrage.\n“Koben-jen, I had no idea who she was. I hope you can\nPerceive that I’m not lying when I say I didn’t mean to cause\nyou any offense. But you attacked me without even bothering\nto find out the facts, so you’ve caused offense too. The only\nway to settle this is with a clean blade.”\nKoben frowned. “Even if you’re a Kaul, you’re not green.\nYou can’t duel me.”\nRu shook his head. “Not you. Him.” He turned his\nattention toward Tadino and pointed at him with the tip of his\ntalon knife. “You set this up. You asked Dano to bring me here\ntonight, you introduced me to Koben’s girlfriend without\ntelling me who she was, and you called the Mountain here to\nhand me a beating.” Ru’s expression was so fearsome that\neveryone left in the room could now see without a doubt that\nhe was indeed the son of Kaul Hiloshudon. “I’ve never met\nyou before tonight, so I can’t see why you’d hate me. You\nmust’ve wanted to use me to harm my family. I take that"

So you can fight me now, or you can answer to my\nfather later.”\nTadino bolted for the stairs but didn’t get far. Koben’s two\nFingers moved with the exceptional speed of Green Bones and\ncaught him by the arms, dragging him back into the lounge\nand forcing him to face Ru. The bartender’s lips were pulled\nback in a frightened grimace; he appeared dumbfounded at the\nway his plot had so abruptly unspooled and unexpectedly\nreknit to ensnare him instead. His eyes darted around the room\nbut found no help anywhere. Dano seemed as fearfully\nbewildered as a hare trapped in a fox den, and the crooked-\nfaced stranger from the bar hung back.\n“Choose your weapon,” Ru demanded.\nAccording to Dano, Tadino used to be a barukan gang\nmember. The man didn’t look weak or cowardly. In fact, he\nseemed like someone who’d been in his share of scraps before,\nnot a person that most people would normally want to fight.\nHe was larger than Ru by a comfortable margin. But he\nhesitated at the sight of the talon knife in Ru’s hand, the way\nthe younger man held it with easy confidence, having been\ntrained by his father from a young age.\n“N-no weapons,” Tadino replied. Bare-handed, he held the\nphysical advantage.\nRu spoke to Koben Ashi. “Koben-jen, if I fight a clean-\nbladed duel with this man to settle our grievance with him,\nwill you agree that there shouldn’t be any offense remaining\nbetween the two of us? And that our families don’t have to get\ninvolved?”\nHe held his breath for Koben’s answer. In the panic of the\nmoment, he’d blurted the challenge of a clean blade because it\nhad been the only way to reclaim control of the situation, to\ndefend his own honor when it seemed he wouldn’t be given\nany chance at all. Now though, he truly wanted to punish\nTadino. If Ru was going to face his father after this fiasco, he\nwanted to say he’d fought a proper duel to preserve his\nreputation, not that he’d been beaten black and blue for\ngroping the wrong girl in Mountain territory. Niko had already\nbroken their da’s heart so badly; what would the Pillar think of\nhim, and what might he do to the Kobens, for such a\nhumiliating incident?\nKoben Ashi seemed to be considering the same thing.\n“Yes,” he said. “I agree.”\nRu sheathed his talon knife and wiped his bloody nose on\nhis sleeve. Ordinarily, he was inclined to think generously of\nothers, so when he encountered genuinely malicious people,\nhis temper was ferocious. “Offer up any prayers you have to\nthe gods, because a barehanded duel isn’t going to hurt any\nless, I promise you.” Seething, he touched his forehead in\nsalute to his opponent without offering so much as a nod of\nrespect. “Why did you do it?”\nTadino’s features contorted as he bared his teeth.

Why does\na rat try to bite the dog that’s killing it? Do you know how\nmany people I’ve seen beaten or branded or taken away? Look\nat my fucking face.” He spat on the ground. “There was\nsupposed to be a revolution. The Janloon bombing was\nsupposed to kill all the clan leaders, and the Clanless Future\nMovement was supposed to build a new society.” Tadino’s\nwords were thick with venom, but he seemed near tears. “You\nknow why I read the trashy clanmags? I keep hoping to see\nyou Green Bone dogs finally kill each other off.”\n“I’m not a Green Bone,” Ru said. He attacked with four\nstrikes to the head in quick succession—two jabs, a left hook,\nand right cross that grazed Tadino’s cheek as the man dodged\ninstinctively, protecting his face. Ru dropped a blistering shin\nkick across his opponent’s thigh.\nTadino hissed with pain and swung for Ru’s face, then his\nbody, hitting him repeatedly before driving his shoulder into\nRu’s chest and trying to pin him to the nearest wall. They\nstruggled in a clinch, both trying to jam each other’s limbs. Ru\ntook one of Tadino’s sharp knees to the stomach, and all the\nbreath in his body whooshed out in a grunt as he folded\nforward. His eyes watered fiercely. He was already hurting in\na dozen places from being knocked around badly by Koben,\nand every blow he took from Tadino made it worse.\nBut Ru was accustomed to being weak and fighting\nanyway. He’d never attended Kaul Du Academy, but the Pillar\nwould not let his son grow up without a martial education, so\nRu had been given plenty of training by his father, his uncles,\nhis family’s stable of private coaches. He’d done knife fighting\ndrills and shooting practice and sparring matches with Green\nBones whose abilities he could never equal. Although he was\nno match for a Fist like Koben Ashi, against another man\nwithout jade, he had every advantage afforded by preparation.\nHe was also twenty years younger and much fitter than\nTadino, who was gasping after only a couple of minutes and a\nfew hits.\nTangled up close with his opponent, Ru kept his wits; he\nducked his head between his folded arms and used the tip of\nhis elbow to nail the larger man in the sternum and ribs several\ntimes, hard. Tadino’s grip on him slackened. As they broke\napart, Ru threw a wicked backfist that smacked Tadino in the\njaw, sending him staggering back, holding his face and\ncursing.\n“You clanless dog,” Ru said with contempt. “You deserve\nworse than a branding.”\nTadino ran at Ru and tried to take him to the ground with\nhis greater size and weight. Ru leapt backward, sprawling,\nseizing Tadino around the neck in a headlock. The two men\ncrashed to the floor. Dano made a muffled noise of alarm and\nthe Mountain Green Bones stepped back, pushing chairs out of\nthe way."

Ru moved too fast for\nthe other man; he swung his whole body around and threw a\nleg across his opponent’s back. Riding astride him, with one\narm wrapped around the man’s neck, he swung furiously,\npunching Tadino in the ear, and the jaw, dropping the tip of his\nelbow repeatedly into the back of the man’s neck, snarling.\nTadino collapsed to his stomach, putting his hands over his\nhead to protect against the blows. Ru switched to burying\npunches in the man’s kidney. In desperation, Tadino tried to\nbuck Ru off, to roll away. Ru put his feet down and loosened\nthe grip with his legs just enough for the man to turn over, then\nleapt on him again with the weight of a knee in the man’s chest\nand continued wailing on him, hitting him in the face\nrepeatedly. Tadino sputtered blood and cried out, “Stop, I give\nup!” Ru did not stop. No one else in the room moved to stop\nhim either. “I concede!” Tadino gurgled. “I said I give up.\nStop, stop, stop!”\n“You thought you could fuck with me because I don’t have\njade?” Ru punched Tadino again, flaying his knuckles on the\nman’s teeth. “You want to fuck with my family, with the No\nPeak clan?” He did not really intend to kill Tadino, but he was\nsoaring high on adrenaline and principled wrath, and he was\ngoing to make sure the man got every bit of what he deserved,\nthat he served as a message that even the Kobens could not\nmisinterpret. Ru might be a stone-eye, but he would not be a\nweak link in his family. He was his father’s son; he would not\nback down from any fight or be used by anyone. You did not\nfuck with any Kaul.\nBero had seen many terrible things in his life, but what\nhappened next would never leave his memory. Tadino,\npanicked, believing he would be beaten to death, tried\nfrantically to push Ru off, shoving at his chest and hips. The\nbartender’s hand fell upon the loosened talon knife sheath in\nRu’s waistband. In a flailing, fateful instant, he seized the hilt\nof the weapon and slashed wildly at the man on top of him.\nThe talon knife caught Ru across the neck and the fine steel\nopened the side of his throat.\nFor a second, no one understood what had happened. Both\nmen stared at each other in shock as blood poured down Ru’s\nshirt and onto the man below him. With astonishment, Ru\nclutched his neck and toppled over onto his side, his mouth\nopening and closing. Juni let out a choked scream.

Bero stared into the frightened eyes and\nsaw the life inside them go out.\nTadino scrambled backward on hands and knees, the talon\nknife still clutched in his hand. His face was a ruined red pulp,\nhis nose crushed and his lips split open, but the whites of his\nbruised eyes rolled about the room, trying to find safety. They\nlanded on Bero, begging. His mouth opened to plead, but no\nsound came out.\nKoben sat back on his heels, his hands and sleeves sticky\nand red. His face was draining of blood as quickly as Kaul’s\nbody. One of the Mountain Fingers said, in a tremulous voice,\n“What do we do, Koben-jen? If the Pillar of No Peak blames\nus …”\n“Kaul Hilo will kill everyone in this room,” Koben said.\nTadino tried again to escape. He was too injured to get\nmore than a few meters. Koben threw a Deflection that\nknocked the man over, then he seized Tadino by the throat and\nheld him at arm’s length as if taking a goose out to the\nchopping block. “You chose an emptyhanded duel but you\ndrew a talon knife,” Koben said. “You dirtied a clean blade.\nYour life is worth less than nothing.”\n“He was going to kill me,” Tadino sobbed through broken\nteeth.\n“I’m a Koben,” the Fist breathed. “My cousin is the\ngodsdamn heir to the clan! I’m not taking the fall for this. I\ncan’t.” He glanced down again at Kaul Ru’s body and then at\nhis Fingers. Bero had never imagined the faces of powerful\nGreen Bones could look so scared and desperate.\nDano was on the floor, crying and retching. Juni stumbled\nup to her boyfriend, her makeup smeared with tears, and\nclutched his arm frantically. “Ashi, I don’t want to die. Please,\nlet’s run away together, right now. Ashi, I love you—” Koben\nbackhanded her viciously across the face and she fell to the\nground, stunned.\n“If we run, we’re fucked.” Koben dug a shaking hand\nthrough his hair. “My family will help us.

Nothing.”\nBero should’ve left with everyone else in the club when\nhe’d had the chance. He’d never had the good sense or normal\nhuman instincts to walk away when he should.

Don’t you still love me too?” Koben\nwrapped his hands around his girlfriend’s throat and squeezed\nwith all his Strength, choking her to death in minutes.\n“What do we do about them?” asked one of the Fingers,\nlooking at Dano and Bero.\nDano was curled on the ground, nearly catatonic with fear.\nHe’d pissed himself. Koben nudged him with a foot. “You\nwere Kaul’s friend, weren’t you? We’ll turn you over to No\nPeak and they can decide what to do with you.” He yanked\nDano partially upright and leaned over him. “But you have to\ntell them.

A vast and yawning\nemptiness swirled through Bero like a dry, howling wind in an\nempty town. Kaul Ru’s youthful, unmoving face seemed to\nstare at him sadly and with grave accusation. Bad luck, it\nseemed to say. Always bad luck.\n“I’m just a regular at the bar,” Bero said. “I’m nobody.”\n“Nobody,” Koben repeated, then chuckled with an edge of\nmania in his voice. “All right, Mr. Nobody, here’s what you’re\ngoing to do, if you want to live. Go out there and tell everyone\nthe truth, understand? Every Lantern Man, policeman, news\nreporter—you tell them what you saw. I never lifted a finger\nagainst Kaul Hilo’s son after I found out who he was. It was\nthe clanless scum who were responsible. The same sort of\npeople who carried out the Janloon bombing and killed my\nown da—it was one of them. I made him suffer before he died,\nand I killed my own woman for her part.

It was insignificance.\nBero clasped his hands together and touched them to his\nforehead in salute. “I’ll tell them. It was bad luck for everyone.\nIt was fate.” He walked, unmolested, out of the Little\nPersimmon, down the narrow stairs and into the night.\nCHAPTER\n50\nTerrible Truths\nH\nilo woke all at once, with the vague awareness that\nsomething—a noise or unusual energy—had tripped his senses\nwhile he slept. The feeling of unease thickened as he lay still\nin the darkness, stretching out his Perception as far as it could\nreach. It was not his jade abilities that convinced him\nsomething was wrong, however, but a flickering gleam of light\nagainst the bedroom windows. Headlights of a car, coming\nthrough the gates of the estate and up the driveway toward the\nhouse.\nHe got out of bed without waking Wen. Closing the\nbedroom door quietly behind him, he went down the stairs. By\nthe time he reached the foot of the staircase, the car was\narriving in the roundabout, and his hyperalert Perception\npicked out four men in the vehicle. One of them was his\ncousin Anden. When Hilo opened the front door, he saw two\nof the clan’s Fingers get out of the parked car. They didn’t\nmove toward the house, but remained standing by the vehicle,\nguarding a slumped figure in the back seat, and letting Anden\nwalk up alone to meet the Pillar. This detail told Hilo\nimmediately, even before he saw his cousin’s face, that\nsomething terrible had happened.\nOver the years, it had become common knowledge within\nthe clan and among its observers that Dr. Emery Anden had\nthe Pillar’s ear, that Kaul Hilo trusted his cousin perhaps more\nthan anyone. If there was a particularly sensitive or difficult\nsubject to broach with the Pillar, Anden would be the best one\nto do it. So in the few seconds that it took for Anden’s steps to\ncarry him to the house, Hilo had a brief window of time to\nprepare himself for why the doctor would be arriving in the\ndead of night. When he saw Anden’s harrowing expression\nilluminated in the yellow light of the house, he said nothing,\nbut stepped aside and let his cousin enter without a word. Hilo\nclosed the door and turned around.\nAnden didn’t sit down or take off his shoes. He stood in\nthe foyer before the Pillar. His face was haggard and his eyes\nwere swollen, and despite being the one sent to deliver the\nnews, it seemed he couldn’t speak. “Hilo-jen,” he began, but\nstruggled visibly to go on.\nA wave of prescient grief swept over Hilo like a tide\ncoming into shore. “It’s okay, Andy. Just say what needs to be\nsaid.”\nThe unexpected gentleness of the words affected Anden\nlike a violent physical blow, rocking him back on his heels, but\nthey broke down the dam in his throat. “Ru was killed in a\nduel tonight.”\nHilo blinked.

        "text": "duel tonight.”\nHilo blinked. When the terrorists’ bomb had gone off and\nthe Kekon Jade Alliance building had collapsed on top of him,\nthe sensation had been unlike anything he’d ever felt before or\ncould even describe. The ground under his feet coming apart.\nThe momentary weightlessness, then instant muffling darkness\nengulfing him, along with a pressure so intense that he could\nbarely move or breathe or even think.\nWhat he felt now was similar, although it happened\ninvisibly and without a sound—a shattering disintegration that\nwas silent, private, and complete. The one thing that kept him\ntethered to the awareness of the moment was Anden, standing\nin front of him. His cousin’s sorrow was palpable, but he was\ndoing his best to control and hide it, so as not to make things\nany worse for his Pillar.\nHilo took three steps into the living room and gripped the\nback of the sofa, leaning against it until he regained enough\ncontrol to look up into his cousin’s face and speak. “Tell me\nwhat happened.”\nAnden sat down on the edge of an armchair facing Hilo\nand told him everything he knew. He’d been on call, but\nnapping in his apartment, when his pager went off and he was\nsummoned to the hospital. The shock he experienced after\nexpecting to deal with an ordinary patient emergency only to\nlearn instead that the body of his nephew had been brought in\nby Fists of the Mountain must’ve been extreme, yet he’d come\nprepared to speak as calmly and factually as he could manage.\nWhen he was done, he stood and with shaking hands poured\nhimself a shot of the strongest hoji in the cabinet.\nThe entire time, Hilo had listened and not said a word. The\nonset of agony was more intense than anything he could’ve\nprepared for even after the deaths of his brother and brothers-\nin-law, yet a small but conscious part of his brain remembered\nthat Wen was still asleep upstairs in their bedroom, and that\nknowledge alone kept him from waking her by collapsing to\nthe ground and howling like an animal.\nHe spoke at last. “Do you believe the story?”\nHilo, of all people, knew that with a strong enough motive\nand planning, a clean-bladed duel could be manipulated, that\nmurder might’ve been arranged. Yet even as he asked himself\nfeverishly, Who needs to die? he could not see the logic of an\nenemy at work. Ru’s death accomplished nothing for the\nMountain, even less for the barukan gangs, or the Crews, or\nanyone else. Ru was not a Green Bone or an heir to the clan’s\nleadership. He was not a threat or an obstacle to anyone. All\nhe had been was Hilo’s son.\nAnden said, “The man in the car outside is Ru’s friend\nfrom college. I was wearing my jade when I talked to him and\nto the Kobens separately, and I didn’t Perceive any deceit. I’m\nnot saying there was no ruse, Hilo-jen. Lott Jin’s men will do\ntheir own interviews and investigation, and if there’s anything\nsuspicious, they’re sure to find it. All I can say is that from\nwhat we know so far, it seems …” Anden swallowed hard\nbefore looking into the Pillar’s face. “Right now, it seems like"

I’ll beg for death if I’m wrong.”\nOutside, it seemed as if the world had ceased moving. Hilo\ncame around the sofa and walked past Anden toward the stairs.\nThe Pillar placed a heavy hand on his cousin’s shoulder as he\npassed. “Thank you, Andy,” he managed to say, quietly. Then\nhe went upstairs to wake his wife and to tell her that their son\nwas dead.\n_______\nThe city of Janloon waited for the murderous rampage. No one\nwas more reliable than Kaul Hiloshudon when it came to\nretribution, and for the death of his son, surely, there would be\nsome terrible vengeance to be taken somewhere. Jaya spoke\nfor many of No Peak’s expectant warriors when she arrived\nhome from Toshon with a dozen of her Fingers and threw\nherself at her father’s feet, begging tearfully, “Da, tell me who\nwe should kill, and I’ll do it!”\nNo one had an answer for her. Ru had offered the clean\nblade. The Horn’s men turned up no evidence that the\nMountain nor anyone else had plotted Ru’s death. The college\nstudent who’d been with Ru at the club had been questioned so\nmany times that he was near mental breakdown, and his story\nwas corroborated by another eyewitness who spoke\nanonymously to the police. At Shae’s urging, Hilo spared\nDano, whose only crime was that of being a worthless friend.\nAlthough they might be tangentially blamed for what had\nhappened at the Little Persimmon, there was no evidence of a\nwider resurgent scheme by the Clanless Future Movement.\nAfter years of relentless persecution and the loss of foreign\nsupport, the CFM was already in its dying throes. Tadino’s\nattempt to goad the clans into war had been a desperate last\ngasp.\nThe day after the tragedy, the Pillar had gone into his study\nwith his Weather Man, his Horn, and his cousin Anden. Hours\nlater, they emerged, red-eyed and grim-faced, and Hilo had\ngiven orders to the clan. Until the circumstances of Ru’s death\nwere fully understood, there would be no retaliatory attacks on\nthe Mountain, no whispering of names, no shedding of blood\nwithout approval. He made it clear that his orders might yet\nchange, but they were to be obeyed. Everyone in the clan\nknew it had been the Pillar’s advisors, all of them level-headed\nand prudent even at a time like this, who had together been\nresponsible for his decision.\nOn the morning of Ru’s funeral, councilwoman Koben Tin\nBett arrived at the Kaul estate with several members of her\nfamily. The heavyset, matronly widow was in her sixties now,\nstill on the upswing of her political career despite recent\nfrictions with her own Pillar. She wore a white shawl and her\nface was dusted with white mourning powder. With her was\nAyt Ato, a college graduate at long last, and recently engaged\nto a member of the Tem family. Hilo agreed to come out of the\nhouse and meet them in the courtyard with his Horn and\nWeather Man in attendance."

Hilo agreed to come out of the\nhouse and meet them in the courtyard with his Horn and\nWeather Man in attendance.\n“Kaul-jen,” councilwoman Koben said, saluting Hilo\ndeeply and without any of her usual smug maternal manner.\nThe woman seemed truly nervous, wetting her lips and\nfidgeting with her shawl. “My heart aches for your loss. Our\nclans and our families have opposed each other in the past, but\nlosing a loved one is a universal suffering. Please accept the\ndeepest condolences of the Koben family.”\nAyt Ato followed Koben Bett’s lead, saluting Hilo\nsolemnly. He cleared his throat. Without any cameras around,\nhe seemed uncertain of exactly where to stand and which\ndirection to face. Ato glanced warily at all of the No Peak\nguards nearby before speaking. “Kauljen, I wish we were\nmeeting under different circumstances. My aunt, Ayt Mada,\nhas asked me to convey her assurance as Pillar that she’s\nquestioned my cousin and his friends and found them innocent\nof any ill intention in this tragedy.”\nThe three men in question, Koben Ashi and his two\nFingers, came forward and lowered themselves to their knees\nin front of Hilo. Their heads were wrapped with gauze and\nbandages. With eyes downcast, they each offered up a small\nblack wooden box in their uplifted hands.\n“Kaul-jen,” said Koben Ashi. “I beg forgiveness for failing\nto save your son from the scheming of clanless dogs who tried\nto bring down both our families. I hope it brings you a small\nmeasure of comfort that your son’s killer suffered greatly\nbefore I ended his life. I nevertheless deserve to die, but if, in\nyour great mercy, you spare my life and those of my blameless\nFingers, I will be relentless against our mutual enemies.” The\nwords came out stiffly and with little inflection, having clearly\nbeen rehearsed.\nA flicker of familiar emotion crossed Hilo’s face—a\nwrathful light across the eyes, a twitch of the mouth. For a\nmoment, everyone watching on both sides thought he might\ndraw his talon knife and kill all three men where they knelt on\nthe pavers. And why not kill Ayt Ato as well, while he was at\nit? The courtyard was immobile with held breaths. Koben Ashi\npaled but kept his eyes on the ground. The black box trembled\nslightly.\nThen the shadow of violence was gone from Hilo’s eyes.\nThe Kobens had not come with any protection, but they had\ncounted astutely on the fact that the Pillar of No Peak would\nnot cast any taint of bad luck on his son’s funeral. Hilo reached\nout and took the black box containing Koben Ashi’s severed\near. He accepted the ears of the two Fingers as well. He did so\nwithout speaking a word.\n“May the gods shine favor on you for your mercy, Kaul-\njen,” murmured Councilwoman Koben. All of the Kobens\nretreated as hastily as decorum allowed, their relief palpable. It\nwasn’t merely fear of No Peak’s retaliation that had caused\nthem to distance themselves from the incident so forcefully\nand to take the extraordinary step of humbling themselves"

Ru had been a\njadeless stone-eye, barely out of his teens. The Kobens were a\nproudly traditional Green Bone family with political clout and\ntheir sights set on clan leadership. Any implication or even\nlingering suspicion that they had broken aisho might severely\ntarnish their reputation. Kaul Hilo’s acceptance of their gesture\nwas an exoneration. A statement to everyone that there would\nnot be war.\nEveryone in the Kaul family knew it wasn’t the decision\nHilo wanted to make. But it was what Ru would’ve wanted.\nRu had always championed compassionate causes, always\nmaintained that No Peak bettered not only its own Green\nBones but all of Kekon. His faith had been absolute. He never\ndoubted that his father could make anything happen. In the\nwake of his death, Ru would never want his family’s actions to\nharm ordinary people and reflect badly on the clan.\n_______\nWen stood silently by her husband’s side at the funeral and\naccepted condolences from the long line of mourners. She\nleaned heavily on her cane, but she no longer cared whether\nshe appeared weak. She was weak. After two days and nights\nof vigil, she could barely stay upright. But she would do this—\nshe would bear this miserable duty with Hilo.\nRu always knew his father loved him. Hilo has that at\nleast. Wen couldn’t say the same for herself. If only she could\nhave one last minute with her son, she would ask him to\nforgive her for being so hard on him all these years. She would\ntell him that every time she’d been critical or impatient, it had\nbeen her fault, not his. She’d worried for him because he was a\nstone-eye. She’d seen herself in him, and on some shameful\nlevel she’d begrudged him for not being the heir she’d hoped\nto bear. Now he was gone, and she would never get the chance\nto tell him that she was proud of him. Ru had always seen\nhimself as whole, even when she could not. He’d been\nconfident and generous and he’d never allowed discontent\nover his deficiency to define him, the way she had.\nWen hated herself for letting sorrow make her resent even\nher own husband, especially since she could barely recognize\nHilo. The warmth in his eyes, his lopsided boyish grin, his\nmagnetic energy, like that of a star burning in the sky—all of it\nhad been snuffed out like a candle. He seemed as inhuman as a\nmarble statue. He acknowledged the clan loyalists who\napproached with nods, occasionally a hoarse word, nothing\nmore.\nWen let her gaze drift in slow detachment over the rest of\nthe family, dressed in white clothes and grief, until her eyes\nfell upon the figure of her eighty-one-year-old mother-in-law,\nhunched under thick blankets on a plastic folding chair. Kaul\nWan Ria seemed completely lost in her own world, mumbling\nquietly to herself. It was unclear whether she knew what was\ngoing on.

Why not escape reality, when it was so\nunbearably cruel to wives and sisters and mothers?\nAt last, all the guests departed and only the Kaul family\nremained in the Heaven Awaiting Cemetery. The afternoon\ntemperature was dropping. A wintry breeze tugged at hats and\nscarves as it moaned through the trees of Widow’s Park. Wen\nthought about stepping into the open pit of her son’s grave to\njoin him at the bottom.\nShae bent down and chose a few of the flowers that had\nbeen left behind. She handed them to Tia, who threw them\nonto the closed casket. Shae bent her head and whispered,\n“Lan will be glad to meet his nephew. He’ll take care of him.”\nHilo’s hands closed into trembling fists at his sides. When\nhe spoke, his voice was coarse and disused. “The minute that\nboy was born, I should’ve given him away to some other\nfamily.” Only Wen and Shae, standing beside him, heard his\nsavage whisper. “Some good but jadeless family with an\nunknown name. What was I thinking, raising a stone-eye into\nthis life?”\nShe knew Hilo was only trying to wish away his pain, but\nthe words lanced Wen’s heart. “You don’t mean that,” she\nbreathed. She realized she could still feel fear. Fear that she\nwould lose Hilo as well, that he would become unrecognizable\nto her.\nRu’s death had been an avoidable and meaningless\naccident. That was the terrible truth staring the family down.\nGreen Bone warriors counted on deaths that meant something.\nThey gave their lives for honor, for jade, for the brotherhood\nof the clan. Ru had been steeped in Green Bone culture from\nbirth. Its values had shaped his entire existence, had made him\nas green in the soul as anyone. But he was not a Green Bone.\nNow he was dead because he’d acted like one. Wen of all\npeople understood that folly.\n“I did it all wrong,” Hilo went on in quiet anguish. “I\nencouraged him, I gave him as much freedom as I could, I\nmade him believe he could do great things, accomplish\nanything he wanted to.” Hilo closed his eyes. “Lies. Whether\nyou wear it or not, there’s no freedom when you’re surrounded\nby green. I wish …” The Pillar’s voice cracked like a brittle\ntwig. “I wish he hadn’t dueled. If only he’d been a coward,\njust once.”\nWen reached for her husband across what felt like a vast\nand lightless gulf. She put her hand into his. At first it\nremained limp, then slowly Hilo’s fingers closed over hers.\nTears stole Wen’s vision and painted tracks in her white face\npowder. Ru had idolized his father. He could never be a\ncoward. He’d fought without Steel or Perception or any\nabilities that might’ve saved his life that night. And he’d won.\nPerhaps that was the great tragedy of jade warriors and their\nfamilies. Even when we win, we suffer.\nAt last, Woon said gently, “It’s getting late. We should go.”"

The sun was behind the approaching man’s back,\nand for a few seconds, Wen couldn’t see his shadowed face,\neven though she recognized his silhouette, the way he walked,\nthe set of his shoulders.\nNiko was dressed in a black suit and white scarf. His hair\nwas longer than it had been, and his face had changed as well.\nIt was leaner and stubbled, and there was something in his\neyes that had not been there before—a slow, haunted softness.\nHe’d been twenty years old when he left Kekon, but he looked\nas if he’d aged a decade in the nearly three years he’d been\naway.\nNiko walked past all of them and stood at the lip of his\nbrother’s grave. Tears welled in his eyes and he let them run\ndown his cheeks without wiping them away. Wen recalled that\nas a child, Niko rarely cried and would often hide in his room\nwhen he did.\n“I’m sorry, Ru,” he whispered. “I should’ve been here for\nyou. We should’ve gone to college together. I was wrong about\nso many things. I’m just … so damned sorry.”\nNiko turned around to face his staring, silent family. With\nslow steps, he went to Hilo and knelt in front of him. “Uncle,\nI’ll never be as good a son as Ru. I’ve done things …\ninexcusable things. But I’ve come home again.”\nWen had not seen her eldest child since the family dinner\nthe night after Ru’s graduation. The muffling grief that had\nencased her for the past week split open under a surge of\nfeeling. Without thinking, her feet moved, carrying her to him\nwith quick steps. When he looked up at her with those large,\nwatchful eyes, her heart flew into her throat.\n“Ma,” he said.\nWen drew her hand back and slapped Niko hard across the\nface. The sound of it rang out like a gunshot. Niko turned his\nface but didn’t flinch as the red mark of Wen’s palm rose on\nhis cheek. Shae stared at Wen in shock and even Jaya made a\nnoise of exclamation.\n“Three years,” Wen exclaimed. “Three years with no\nvisits, no phone calls or letters, nothing.” After his initial\nemployment contract with GSI had ended ten months ago, no\none in the family had heard from him. Who knew what he’d\nbeen doing all this time.\n“I deserved that,” Niko mumbled. “I was thinking only of\nmyself when I ran away. Ru tried to tell me, but I …” Niko’s\nface buckled with emotion and he didn’t finish. Composing\nhimself with effort, he raised his eyes to Hilo, who stared\ndown at his nephew, an unreadable mess of emotions raging\nacross his expression. Niko clasped his hands together and\nbrought them to his forehead in salute. “The clan is my blood,\nand the Pillar is its master. Will you forgive me and accept me\nas your son again?”"

Will you forgive me and accept me\nas your son again?”\nWithout waiting for Hilo’s answer, Niko drew a talon knife\nfrom the sheath at his waist. Drawing a fortifying breath, he\ngrasped the top of his left ear and sliced downward with the\nknife, cutting into the groove between his ear and skull.\nHilo’s hand shot out and seized Niko’s wrist. Their eyes\nlocked over the knife. For a moment, neither man moved.\nBlood streamed down the side of Niko’s face, running down\nhis neck and soaking the collar of his shirt. He was trembling\nwith pain. Slowly, the Pillar loosened his nephew’s fingers\nfrom the hilt and took away the talon knife.\n“You never stopped being my son.” Hilo closed a hand\nfiercely on a fistful of Niko’s hair and kissed his brow, then\nlifted his nephew’s scarf and pressed it against the damaged\near, holding it in place as a bloom of red spread across the\nwhite fabric. “We all make mistakes. Sometimes terrible\nmistakes we can barely live with. But we learn from them.\nAnd maybe …” His voice collapsed. “Maybe we can forgive\neach other.”\nTHIRD INTERLUDE\nThe Charge of Twenty\nI\nn the final year of the Many Nations War, the Empire of\nShotar relied heavily on its control of the East Amaric Ocean,\nwith the occupied island of Kekon being its most significant\nasset. For this reason, the Charge of Twenty, a famous event in\nKekonese history that is rarely studied by outsiders, is\nconsidered by some experts to be a far more important turning\npoint in the global conflict than it’s given credit for.\nThe One Mountain Society’s attack on the heavily fortified\nShotarian military base near present-day Lukang was nearly a\ncomplete disaster. Shotarian spies provided early warning of\nthe assault, so the element of surprise was lost. Instead, the\nadvancing Green Bone warriors were met with heavy artillery\nand twice the number of expected defenders. Leaving a small\nforce inside the base, the Shotarians sallied into the\nsurrounding area with superior numbers, encircling the rebels’\nposition.\nWhen Kaul Dushuron realized that he and his men were\ntrapped and facing slaughter, he gathered together twenty of\nhis strongest Green Bones, himself included, and sixty of his\nweaker and less experienced followers. “This is the true test of\nour brotherhood,” he said. “Only together, in our most dire\nmoment, can we reach for the power of Heaven and turn the\nfavor of the gods.”\nThe sixty less powerful men willingly gave their jade to\ntheir commander and their more skilled peers. Wearing far\nmore jade than their bodies could normally handle was asking\nfor death from the Itches, but health effects were of no\nconcern.\nThat night, the twenty chosen Green Bones cut their\ntongues on their knives to seal their commitment. Together,\nthey struck the lightly defended Shotarian base with so much\nsavagery and extraordinary jade ability that surviving\neyewitnesses claimed they leapt over walls and moved too fast\nfor their enemies to see, that bullets flew away from them and\nthey killed soldiers with a single touch.

Twenty Green Bones\nbrought down the gates and slaughtered nearly three hundred\nmen before they were finally slain. Kaul Dushuron’s torn body\nwas hung from the watchtower.\nSeveral contingents of Shotarian soldiers rushed back to\nhelp defend the base. When dawn broke, the exhausted troops\nsaw the entire force of the One Mountain Society descending\nupon them. Believing that every Green Bone would be as\nterrible and nearly unkillable as the twenty sent in advance, the\ndefenders panicked. Many of the soldiers were not even\nShotarians, but Tuni, Uwiwans, and other poorly trained\nconscripts brought from other parts of the empire. In the first\nwave of the attack, they fled or surrendered.\nThe One Mountain Society spread news of the heroic\nCharge of Twenty across the country through secret radio\nbroadcasts, print, and word carried through the country’s\nnetwork of Lantern Men. Within days, all of Kekon was in\nopen rebellion against the remaining occupation forces. Two\nweeks later, the beleaguered Shotarian military officially\nwithdrew from Kekon.\nAt Kaul Du’s belated state funeral, his grief-stricken father\ndeclined to speak, asking his comrade Ayt Yugontin to do so in\nhis place. “Good men are remembered with love by their\nfriends,” declared the Spear of Kekon. “Great warriors are\nremembered with awe by their enemies.”\nAyt brought the hero’s two small sons and his pregnant\nwidow onto the stage and declared that Kaul Du’s descendants\nwould be forever favored by the gods.

Please let it be today, she prayed silently.\nI can’t do this anymore. She stepped through the rising midday\nheat into the shade of the gazebo and sat down in her usual\nspot, hands folded in her lap. She glanced up briefly. The\nPillar of the Mountain was wearing a bright green silk scarf\nthat complemented the jade coiled around her bare arms. For a\nwoman in her midsixties, Ayt was still admirably fit. Her skin\nwas wrinkled but not saggy and the gray in her hair was\nblended into silver highlights. When the lines around her eyes\ntightened, however, Lula thought she looked ancient and\nterrifying.\nThe Pillar uncrossed her legs and smoothed a crease in her\nlinen pants. She lifted a pitcher and poured cool mint tea into a\nglass, setting it in front of Lula before pouring one for herself.\nThe gesture of regard for an honored guest made Lula’s breath\ncatch with hope. She glanced at the thick stack of paper that\nthe Pillar had been examining and could see that they were\ntranscripts. Pages and pages of dense text with only a few\npertinent sections highlighted and marked with red tape flags.\nThey represented hundreds of hours of recorded conversation\nfrom the meetings and phone calls of Art Wyles, CEO of\nAnorco Global Resources, gathered from wiretaps and\nrecording devices that Lula had hidden inside the Espenian\nexecutive’s houses."

You know I hate that demure expression you\nuse.”\nLula firmed her lips and forced her eyes up. “I’m sorry,\nAyt-jen, it’s become a bad habit.” She’d learned that the\nforeigners liked it when she acted awestruck in their presence,\nbut right now, she was not acting. How could she not be\nnervous when sitting across from the forbidding woman who\ncontrolled her life completely?\n“What have you learned since we last spoke?”\n“Premier Waltor has officially approved the cabinet\nappointment,” Lula said. “Mr. Wyles will take office as\nsecretary of Foreign Trade at the end of the month.”\n“And he will step down as president and CEO of Anorco?”\n“Espenian law requires that he do so to avoid conflicts of\ninterest. But he’ll maintain a controlling stake in the\nconglomerate and remain president emeritus of the Munitions\nSociety. As for Operation Firebreak, he’s putting his Keko-\nEspenian business partner Jim Sunto, the head of GSI, in\ncharge of the contract with the War Department.”\nThe Pillar nodded. “And what of his arrangement with the\nCrews?”\n“He’ll continue to launder money for the Baker Street\nCrew for the usual cut. The Crews will still buy jade from\nAnorco at a guaranteed set price and move it onto the black\nmarket. In addition, Mr. Wyles will receive increased monthly\npayments for being Joren Gasson’s influential friend in\nAdamont Capita.” Wyles had never told her any of this\ndirectly, but Lula had pieced it together over time,\neavesdropping on phone calls with “Jo Boy,” asking about\nWyles’s childhood friends from Port Massy, noticing that\nwhen they traveled to Marcucuo, he had meetings with\nEspenian men in dark suits who left behind briefcases of\nbundled thalirs. “Wyles is taking greater precautions now, to\nkeep the association secret. He won’t meet or communicate\nwith Gasson directly anymore and won’t be seen near him.”\nThe Espenian press portrayed Art Wyles as a devoutly\nTruthbearing self-made man who had come from a poor\nfamily in a tough neighborhood of Port Massy and risen to\nwealth and power through business acumen and savvy\ninvestments.

Lula, who had out of necessity done her\nhomework on the man, was surprised that Espenians wished to\nbelieve this fairy tale, or at least conveniently ignore whispers\nand evidence to the contrary.\nKekonese people know that no man rises without\npatronage and protection. The oligarch Wyles owed his early\nsuccess to the Baker Street Crew—the largest, wealthiest,\nmost politically well-connected organized crime outfit in the\nRepublic of Espenia. Ayt Mada hadn’t known this for certain\nwhen she first found Lula and placed her in the foreigner’s\npath—but the courtesan’s discoveries had not surprised her.\nObtaining enough recorded proof to make this knowledge\nuseful, however, had taken years.\nLula’s hand shook, rattling the ice cubes in the glass as she\ndrank down the cool tea, trying to drown the anxiety curled in\nher stomach. Each time she’d come to Ayt’s mansion to make\nher report, she’d left with the Pillar’s words dragging down\nher steps. “We don’t have what we need yet. You’ll have to go\nback and get us more.”\nSo she had. Over and over again, to be the foreigner’s\nmistress. She took his cock into her mouth, her pussy, her ass.\nShe pretended to love it, to love him. She learned to lie\nfluently in Espenian, to whisper that he was the best lover\nshe’d ever had, that she was so lucky and grateful he’d noticed\nher and made her his woman, given her such nice things and\ntreated her so well. She accompanied a man forty years older\nthan her on business trips and stayed with him in five-star\nhotels. She planted bugs in his houses in Marcucuo and\nKarandi—but not Espenia, because he had a wife and family\nthere, and another mistress, so she could not be seen in that\ncountry. She pretended to convert to the Church of One Truth\nand went to services with Wyles, mouthing the foreign words\nof worship to a foreign God and Seer. She coaxed him into\ntalking about his friends, his businesses, his political\nambitions. She pretended to struggle with Espenian, to not\nunderstand all the things he spoke of, so he talked about them\nfreely, with the sense of safety a person feels around their cat.\nWhen Wyles was away from Kekon, Lula could pretend\nshe was free. She could take singing lessons and dream about\ngoing to college and one day having a real career as a music\nteacher. She could be with Sumi and imagine a future together.\nSumi wept over the trap they were in and vowed she would\nwait, but Lula knew no one’s resolve was infinite. Every time\nthe phone rang and it was the foreigner summoning her back\nto his house, their fragile illusions of happiness were snuffed\nout.\nShe asked the question she’d been dreading. “Do you have\nenough, Ayt-jen?”\nAyt Mada considered the stack of evidence in front of her,\none of the many that Lula had provided for her over the years.\n“Do I have enough?” The Pillar gazed out across the perfectly"

Nostalgia? Pity? “You’re still\na young woman,” Ayt said. “Enjoy it while you can.”\nIt was the closest thing to an acknowledgment of her\nsacrifice the Pillar had ever made. Lula had given up seven\nyears of her youth to be a foreigner’s whore, a White Rat for\nthe Mountain clan. She suspected she was the only one of the\nclan’s many rats to report to Ayt directly, a great honor, surely.\nShe was grateful for what the clan had provided to her family.\nAnd she hated the Pillar with the quiet and resigned hatred a\nrabbit has for its captors.\nAyt Mada motioned one of her Green Bone bodyguards\nover and asked him to bring her a phone. “You’ve done well,\nLula,” she said. “I have what I need. Go home to your family.\nYou won’t need to worry about the foreigner calling for you\nagain.”\nLula dropped from the bench onto her knees and pressed\nher forehead to the wooden decking of the gazebo. “Thank\nyou, Ayt-jen,” she choked out through tears. She sat up and\nsaluted with trembling hands. “May the gods shine favor on\nyou.”\nThe bodyguard returned and passed the handset of a\ncordless phone to the Pillar. Ayt was no longer looking at the\nother woman. She was flipping through a small book of notes\nas she dialed. The weeping courtesan might as well not exist\nanymore. As Lula rose to her feet and backed out of the\ngazebo for the last time, she heard Ayt speaking into the\nreceiver. “Iwe-jen,” said the Pillar, “it’s time we made those\narrangements we’ve been planning.”\nCHAPTER\n52\nA Search Ended\nthe twenty-sixth year, fifth month\nN\niko entered the slum house in Coinwash and wrinkled his\nnose at the smell of urine in the stairwell. The poorest parts of\nJanloon were not as bad as some of the most desperate places\nhe’d seen in his worldly travels, but they were still the sort of\nplace nearly everyone would avoid, including Green Bones.\nToo dark to see green, as the saying went—literally in this\ncase, as the lights were burned-out in the hallway.\nThe two Green Bone bodyguards that the Pillar had\nassigned to him followed close behind Niko up to the second\nfloor, where he found the unit he was looking for and knocked.\nThere was no answer, but he could sense someone inside.

There was no lock on the door, so Niko pushed\nopen the flimsy barrier and stepped into the room.\nA middle-aged man in shorts and a stained T-shirt was\nslumped on the threadbare carpet in front of a dilapidated sofa,\nwatching a small tube television that rested on top of an\nupside-down wooden crate. The smell of mold and stale beer\npervaded the windowless space. Several empty liquor bottles\nlay discarded on the floor. The man glanced up at Niko with\nincurious hostility.\n“Are you Betin Rotonodun?” Niko asked.\nThe drunk grimaced with one-half of his face. The other\nhalf remained slack. “No one calls me that,” he snorted. He\nlooked away and took a swallow from the bottle of beer in his\nhand. “Who the fuck are you? Are you from the government?”\n“I’m from the No Peak clan,” Niko said, “and I have some\nquestions to ask you.”\nThat got the man’s attention. He jerked up straight and\nstared at Niko alertly now, his bloodshot eyes bulging to the\nsize of lychees as they came to rest on the long string of jade\nbeads around the visitor’s neck.\n“You’re …” The man blinked twice and wet his lips.\n“You’re one of the Kauls.”\nNiko motioned for his bodyguards to remain in the hall. He\nwalked across the tiny room and turned off the television.\nNoticing a step stool against the wall, he moved it before\nsitting down on it, facing his interviewee, who remained where\nhe was on the floor, still staring with disbelief. “You weren’t\nan easy person to find, Mr. Betin,” Niko said.\n“Bero,” the man corrected sharply. “I never use that other\nname, and I don’t owe anything to the bastard who gave it to\nme. How do you know it?” His heart rate had shot up, even\nNiko could Perceive that, though he didn’t seem frightened,\nexactly. Unnerved. Perhaps excited. “Do you know who I\nam?”\nNiko nodded. He took a digital voice recorder from his\npocket and placed it on the edge of the crate next to the\ntelevision. “You’re Catfish. You were a spy for the Espenian\nmilitary who fed them information on the Clanless Future\nMovement for several years up until the Janloon bombing.\nAfter that, you disappeared from any records, so I assume you\nwere whisked away with a new identity. But you used your\nlegal name to apply for government assistance, so I knew you\nwere back in Janloon.”\nBero gaped at him. Niko couldn’t blame him for being\nastonished. The Janloon bombing had been twelve years ago.\nThe Clanless Future Movement still existed but had been\nground down to dregs. The decades-long Slow War had\nexacted a staggering cost in money and lives in wars all\naround the world, but if it wasn’t quite coming to a decisive\nresolution, at least it was going into a state of dormancy, with\nYgutanian retrenchment and negotiated bilateral withdrawal\nfrom overseas conflicts.

The former spy probably figured no\none would try to find him. Even the Espenian government\nseemed to tacitly agree with that assessment, since it had\ndeclassified most of its documents over ten years old.\nThe No Peak clan, however, had a long memory and\nlonger grudges. Niko’s aunt Shae had given him an unusual\nassignment: Use newly declassified information that the clan\nhad obtained to track down firsthand accounts of the ROE’s\nsecret activities in Kekon prior to and immediately after the\nJanloon bombing. She’d assigned a couple of people to help\nhim with the project, which they both knew would involve\nchasing a lot of dead ends. Niko was aware that the Weather\nMan was testing him, but that didn’t bother him.\nTimeconsuming, methodical detective work far out of the\nspotlight suited him fine.\nUnfortunately, after six months, Niko still didn’t have\nenough concrete evidence of the ROE’s activities to help the\nWeather Man substantiate her suspicions. The two retired\nmilitary intelligence operatives he tracked down refused to\ntalk to the fake reporter he sent their way. The ROE used code\nnames for its informers; sometimes he could determine their\nidentities, but most of them could not be found. The file on\nCatfish had come with a copy of an arrest record for anti-clan\nvandalism, which could be cross-referenced with the Janloon\npolice database, but it was sheer luck that Bero’s legal name\nhad shown up again recently in the government’s system, and\nonly, it appeared, because the man was a destitute alcoholic\nsurviving on social welfare.\n“I want to know about your previous work for the\nEspenians,” Niko said. “In as much detail as possible.”\nBero was silent for nearly a full minute. Then he laughed\nout loud, a raspy bark of incredulous delight. “That’s it?”\n“You’ll be paid for it, if that’s what you’re asking.” Niko\ntook an envelope out of his breast pocket and set it down near\nthe recorder. It seemed a waste of clan money; he was\nconfident the man would spend every last dien on liquor.\nBero looked at the envelope and then at Niko. A strange\nexpression suffused his crooked face, a faintly deranged\neagerness as he sat forward and let out a foul-smelling sigh of\nsatisfaction. “Sure, keke, sure. I’ll tell you everything.”\n“Good.” Niko turned on the recorder. “Did you know a\nman named Vastik eya Molovni?”\n_______\nUpon his return to Janloon, Niko hadn’t expected to be\nwelcomed or forgiven by the clan. Indeed, he hadn’t been.\nPlenty of naysayers, inside and outside of No Peak, speculated\nunkindly and sometimes outrageously that he’d come back\nbecause he’d run out of money, that he was a foreign agent\nwho would betray his family again, that he had a secret lover\nand couldn’t marry until he restored his position in the clan,\namong other theories.\nNiko could do nothing about the harsh gossip except\nendure it and try not to let it affect him.

He performed the\nmost painful penance he could think of, worse than cutting off\nhis ear, as far as he was concerned: He agreed to television,\nradio, and newspaper interviews where he spoke candidly\nabout his decision to leave and to return. Over and over again,\nhe apologized humbly and publicly for having hurt and\ndisappointed his family and his clan, and promised that he\nwould do his best to prove himself a worthy son and potential\nheir from now on.\nHis grieving parents hadn’t been of much support at first.\nThe Pillar officially accepted his return to the clan, but was\notherwise withdrawn, and Niko didn’t expect his mother to\never forgive him, not when he hadn’t been there to protect Ru\nwhen it mattered.\nNiko soldiered on regardless. Over time, the doubters’\nangry grumblings would fade, so long as he put his head down\nand proved he could back up his intentions with action. He’d\ndone as Ru had once suggested, attending Jan Royal university\npart-time and progressing steadily toward a joint degree in\neconomics and organizational management. For two years, he\nworked evenings on the military side of the clan. Ironically, all\nthe training and experience he’d gained during his\nemployment with GSI had improved his martial confidence,\nand his motivations were different now. He was promoted to\nFist in six months, laying to rest the question of whether his\npreviously unremarkable performance had been an issue of\nability.\nWith his aunt Shae’s blessing, he began shadowing Terun\nBin, the clan’s Master Luckbringer, to learn about the Ship\nStreet side of the clan. Soon after, the Weather Man began to\ngive him work to do on his own time, including this project of\nchasing down old breadcrumbs. Recently, he’d begun\nattending and observing his aunt’s meetings with Lantern Men\nand other clan stakeholders.\nIn the three years that had passed since his return to\nJanloon, Niko had determinedly done everything that could be\nexpected of him and more.\n“You used to be so stuck-up, always wanting to ignore the\nrules and do your own thing. Now you’re a worker ant who\ndoesn’t seem to sleep,” Jaya said, in an unexpected moment of\nsisterly concern for him. “What happened to you?”\n“I’m not a moody teenager anymore. I grew up and gained\nperspective, Jaya. That’s all.”\nIt was a shallow answer when the truth was more\ncomplicated, not something he was sure he could ever explain.\nHe’d left Kekon in search of the indefinable. A sense of who\nhe was, independent of the clan. An answer to the nagging\nquestion of who he could’ve been, if his uncle hadn’t taken\nhim from his birth mother and made him the first son of the\nKaul family. When he’d joined GSI, he’d imagined that the\nforeigners were right—the world of Green Bones was brutal\nand outdated, nothing like the rest of the world.\nNow he knew better.

There was jade and blood and cruelty\neverywhere.\nAfter leaving GSI, he’d wandered without any destination\nin mind, chased wherever he went by guilty memories and the\nvague dread that he was tainted for breaking aisho and could\nnever return home for fear of bringing disfavor back with him.\nInstead, he traveled east across the Orius continent and spent\ntwo months in Lybon, Stepenland, hoping to awaken some\nrevelatory connection to the city of his birth. It was a pleasant\nplace, utterly foreign, rarely a Kekonese person in sight. He\nfelt nothing there.\nHe left and crossed the ocean to Karandi, then went on to\nthe Spenius continent, then south to Alusius. Along the way he\nworked menial jobs for cash, more to do something with\nhimself than any real need for money. He cut wood and\nstacked boxes, cleaned tables and mopped floors. He wore his\njade hidden, like a thief.\nHe’d been living in a motel room across from a pleasantly\nquiet beach on the Alusian side of the Mesumian Sea when he\nreceived a phone call from Teije Inno, one of the few people\nhe’d kept in touch with after leaving GSI and who knew where\nhe was. Over the phone, Teije apologized. For the whole time\nthey’d known each other and been friends, he’d been a White\nRat for the No Peak clan. Now Teije was calling on behalf of\nthe Horn, to give Niko the news that his brother had been\nkilled.\n_______\nWhen Bero was done speaking, Niko nodded and turned off\nthe recorder. “You’ve been very helpful,” he said. He took a\npen from his pocket and wrote on the envelope that he’d left\nbeside the television. “The money in the envelope is yours, but\nI’m also giving you a phone number in the Weather Man’s\noffice. If you call tomorrow morning, and say who you are,\nthey’ll have orders from me to find you a place to live that’s\nbetter than this dump. Three months of rent will be paid for.\nYou can use that time to get sober and find a job and maybe\nimprove your life. Or you can spend the money to drink\nyourself to death in slightly nicer surroundings. The offer is\nthere for tomorrow only. It’s up to you.” He stood to go.\n“You’re done?” His interviewee sounded disappointed,\nalmost angry. As Niko reached the door, Bero called after him.\n“Hey, wait! You asked me plenty of questions, so I get to ask\nyou a question too. That’s only fair, right?”\nNiko turned around. Bero was climbing to his feet,\nbloodshot eyes fixed in a reckless stare. “That’s a really nice\nnecklace you’re wearing. Really distinctive looking. Tell me\nsomething. How did you get that jade?”\nNiko brought a hand up to the string of beads around his\nneck, each stone identical and flawless, separated with black\nspacers on a silver chain. “It belonged to my father,” Niko\nsaid. “I earned it, piece by piece, by proving myself in the\nclan.”\nBero gave a strange giggle. “Your father was Kaul Lan, the\nPillar of No Peak. You’re his son.”"

You’re his son.”\n“That’s generally how it works, yes,” Niko said\nimpatiently.\nThe man pointed to him. “I’d recognize that jade\nanywhere, because it used to be on my neck.” He jabbed a\nfinger proudly toward his own chest. “I was more than just a\ntool for the foreigners, you know. Before that, I was a\nsmuggler and a thief, a grave robber, and most of all, I was a\nkiller. Everyone around me ends up feeding worms. I’m a\nfucking demigod of death, keke. I’ve probably killed more\npeople than most Green Bones. More people that you have, I\nbet.”\nBero’s grin was the leer of a bleached skull. “Long ago, the\nMountain sent me after your da. I did it for the jade. That jade.\nI found him at the Docks and I pulled the trigger. I started the\nclan war all those years ago. I’m the reason you’re an orphan.\nAnd here we are.” He laughed like an injured hyena. “Finally,\nthe gods are tying up their sick comedy act.”\nWhen Niko had walked into the room, the man on the floor\nhad been a tired, huddled figure wrapped in sour apathy. Now\nhe was standing straight, his thinning hair drooping over dark\neyes that shone down into the bottomless well of rage and\ndespair that came from staring too long into an abyss and\nseeing nothing. His sweating face bore the mad stamp of a\nman holding a knife to his own throat and shouting, desperate\nfor recognition at the end of it all.\n“Well?” Bero swayed alarmingly toward Niko as if toward\nthe window ledge of a building. “Don’t you have anything to\nsay? Can’t you use your Perception to know I’m telling the\ntruth? If you believed everything else I told you before, you\nhave to believe me now. Aren’t you going to—”\nWith a sharp motion of his wrist, Niko flicked out a short,\nhorizonal Deflection that struck Bero in the midsection like the\nthwack of a pole to the gut. The man grunted out his breath as\nhe was knocked onto his rear. He looked up expectantly for the\nnext blow, but Niko hadn’t moved from his spot.\n“Do you think any Green Bone can be goaded into killing\ncarelessly at the drop of a pin?” Niko spoke with calm but\nastonished contempt. “Just because I could break your neck,\nyou expect me to do you the favor? Do you honestly believe it\nwould make your sorry life more dramatic or meaningful, for\nyou to be murdered by the No Peak clan?”\nNiko’s pity confused and enraged the man. “Don’t you get\nit? I’m everything the Green Bones hate and want to crush\nunder their heels,” Bero snarled. He picked himself off the\nfloor, breathing hard and holding his stomach. “It’s because I\nwon’t settle for being a nobody!

His shoulders were heaving. “I\nkilled your father.”\n“You didn’t,” Niko told him bluntly. “I never knew my\nfather, but he was a good person, a respected Pillar, and one of\nthe most powerful Green Bones anyone could name. That’s\nwhat I’ve been told all my life, and it’s what I choose to\nbelieve. The Mountain clan murdered him, but the truth of it is\nthat a man like that can only be brought down by his own\nflaws, in the face of forces beyond anyone’s control. Not by\nsomeone like you.”\nThe bodyguards out in the hall hadn’t moved despite the\nyelling, since the unarmed jadeless drunkard was of no threat\nand they Perceived no alarm from their boss.\nNiko squinted at Bero coldly as the man stared up at him\nin mute disbelief. “You’re not from a Green Bone clan, so you\ndon’t understand,” Niko explained, as if to a dim child.\n“Ending lives out of vengeance is an important decision. I\nwouldn’t disrespect my father’s memory by taking what you\nsaid seriously. If you want to end your life, do the job yourself,\nbut don’t fool yourself into thinking it has meaning.”\nNiko left the room and walked out of the building with his\nbodyguards. He was deeply unsettled. Not by what the\ndrunkard had said, but by what he’d seen in those hollow eyes.\nEven a wretched man like Bero, sunken to the bottom of\nsociety, still harbored an intense, maddening desire to be part\nof the great myth. It was a myth that ruled Kekon and its\npeople down to its bones, that drove society’s obsession with\nthe trappings of greenness, that even seduced foreigners who\ncould never truly understand it.\nClans and jade, murder and vengeance, burdens and feuds\nand failures passed down from father to brother to son—none\nof it was a myth to Niko at all, but part of his lived experience,\ninescapable but malleable truths that it had taken him a world\nof searching to accept.\nCHAPTER\n53\nOld Secrets\nS\nhae had been waiting patiently for the inevitable request\nthat she meet with the Espenian ambassador. She took Niko\nwith her. In the car during the drive from Ship Street into the\nMonument District, she tested her nephew. “How do you think\nwe should approach this meeting?”\nOne of Niko’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, an expression\nthat always reminded her of Lan. “The Espenians never ask for\na meeting unless they want something, but they’re always\nprepared to give in return.

We can’t give in to their demands, but with the jade\ndecriminalization bill finally moving through the National\nAssembly, we also don’t want to do anything to jeopardize the\nrelationship.”\nShae nodded, pleased with his astute answer. “I see you’ve\nbeen keeping up with the news.” Niko had applied himself to\nlearning the workings of the clan with a dedication that had\nsurprised everyone. She suspected that he grieved for Ru by\noccupying himself with work during every waking hour. She\nwasn’t sure it was healthy for him, but she also couldn’t\nbegrudge his accomplishments.\nThe Espenian embassy was a modern, gleaming glass cube\nof a building flying a dozen ROE flags from the top of its steel\ngate and deliberately overshadowing the other, more modest\nforeign diplomatic offices in the Monument District. Upon\nbeing admitted past security, Shae and Niko were led into the\nambassador’s private sitting room, a sunny but formal\nchamber with high-backed cushioned chairs and portraits of\nfamous Espenian premiers on the walls.\nAmbassador Lonard greeted them and introduced Colonel\nJorgen Basso, the newly installed commanding officer of\nEuman Naval Base. In the years that Shae had been Weather\nMan, she’d dealt with seven different ROE ambassadors and\nthree military commanders. She remembered how nervous\nshe’d been the first time she’d sat down with Ambassador\nGregor Mendoff and Colonel Leland Deiller in the White\nLantern Club, the outright skepticism they’d shown toward her\nas a young woman and an inexperienced Weather Man. Both\nmen were long gone, retired to their home country.\nLonard and Basso saluted the longtime Weather Man in the\nproper Kekonese manner, then shook her hand, thanking her\nfor coming to meet with them. Shae did not introduce Niko, as\nshe’d brought him as an observer. He positioned his chair\nbehind and to the left of Shae’s seat.\nAmbassador Lonard was a long-faced woman with thin\nlips and straight, dark eyebrows over unsmiling eyes. She was\nat least a decade younger than Shae but carried herself with the\nunpretentious confidence of an old political hawk. She perched\nstraight-backed in her chair and folded her hands over her\nknee. “Ms. Kaul,” she said, “I was hoping your Pillar would\njoin us as well.”\n“My brother is busy today,” Shae said. Hilo still hated\ndiplomatic bullshit. “Your predecessor ought to have explained\nto you that as Weather Man, I speak on the Pillar’s behalf.”\nShe gave the foreigners a polite, expectant smile. “What can\nthe No Peak clan do for our Espenian friends?”\nThe ambassador motioned for an aide to close the door to\nthe sitting room. It swung shut on silent hinges. “I assume\nyou’re aware of the situation that’s been developing on Euman\nIsland.”\n“If you’re referring to the protest camp, yes, I’m aware of"

It swung shut on silent hinges. “I assume\nyou’re aware of the situation that’s been developing on Euman\nIsland.”\n“If you’re referring to the protest camp, yes, I’m aware of\nit,” Shae said.\nColonel Basso, a large, bald, brown-skinned man with\nspectacles, perhaps Tomascian in ancestry, said with gruff\nindignation, “There are over two thousand civilians camped\nwithin two kilometers of an ROE military base, with more\njoining every day for the past month. They pose an\nunacceptable security risk.”\n“They’re not on your property,” Shae replied calmly. “That\npart of Euman Island is historically an indigenous area. Last\nyear, the Royal Council passed a bill to restore it to Abukei\ngovernance. The people who’ve gathered there are doing so\nwith the permission of tribal leaders, as protest against the\noffshore jade mining that’s continued despite years of national\nopposition.”\nAmbassador Lonard’s thin lips all but disappeared when\nshe tightened them. “An unruly mob is not the best way to\naddress a complicated issue.”\nShae raised her eyebrows. “There’s nothing complicated\nabout it. The issue persists because the Espenian government\ncontinues to support Anorco’s exploitative business\noperations.”\nOver the course of a dozen years, neither the diplomatic\nefforts on the part of the Kekonese government nor repeated\nattempts by the clans to destroy the mining ships had been\nsuccessful. The local Abukei tribes, fed up with the ongoing\nenvironmental destruction of their fishing grounds, had\nmounted a protest that had rapidly garnered widespread public\nsupport.\nAmbassador Lonard adeptly refused to be drawn further\ninto the underlying argument. “My immediate concern is for\nthe safety of the Espenian and Kekonese citizens who could be\nendangered if this intentionally provocative gathering turns\nviolent.”\nShae didn’t bother to point out that the ambassador was\nlikely more concerned about the ongoing press coverage of the\nEuman Standoff, as it was being called by the media. The\nEspenians preferred not to draw public attention to the fact\nthat they still had such a large military presence in the country,\ndespite promises to the Kekonese government that they would\nreduce their forces as part of the international effort to bring\nthe Slow War to an end.\nShae sat back. “What is it you want the No Peak clan to\ndo?”\nAmbassador Lonard and Colonel Basso exchanged\nglances, as if the answer was self-evident and Shae was being\nobdurate, which she was. She already knew what the\nforeigners were asking for, but she wanted them to have to say\nit out loud.\nThe colonel was the one to be blunt. “Break up the\nencampment and persuade the protestors to leave.”\n“By force, if necessary,” Shae added for them.\n“Green Bones are more than capable of force,” Lonard\npointed out. “Although I would hope that a strong show of\nintent would be enough to control the situation.”\nEven though the request was exactly what Shae had\nexpected, she was nonetheless deeply offended and filled with\na cold anger that she controlled and folded carefully into her\nanswer. “Over the twenty-six years that I’ve been Weather\nMan of No Peak,” she said, “I’ve seen the relationship"

        "text": "a cold anger that she controlled and folded carefully into her\nanswer. “Over the twenty-six years that I’ve been Weather\nMan of No Peak,” she said, “I’ve seen the relationship\nbetween our countries go through many phases. In some ways,\nwe’re friends who’re closer than ever before. But friendship is\nsomething that can be abused. When that happens, it can lead\nto hard feelings and even enmity. Espenia has asked Kekon for\njade, soldiers, land, military support, and political concessions.\nAnd now, you’re suggesting that Green Bones turn against the\npeople we protect. Most of the protestors encamped on Euman\nIsland are jadeless civilians. You’re asking us to break aisho.”\nColonel Basso glanced down uncomfortably at Shae’s\nfrankness, but Ambassador Lonard did not. “Ms. Kaul, I have\na doctorate in East Amaric Studies. I’ve lived in Kekon for\nyears, and I’ve learned enough about the country and its Green\nBone clans to say with confidence that aisho is an ideal that’s\n… not always feasible or strictly followed.”\nThe Espenian inclined her head as she held Shae’s gaze.\n“Can you honestly claim that Green Bones—including you\nand your family—have never bent moral principles for your\nown self-interest? Haven’t you brutally punished anti-clan\ndissidents, unsanctioned jade wearers, and foreign competitors\nwithout any moral compunction?” Lonard spoke,\nunexpectedly, in accented but fluent Kekonese. “Gold and\njade, never together. Has that ever really been true?”\nThe Weather Man’s silence was enough of an answer for\nLonard. Switching back to Espenian, she said, “Your clan and\nits supporters in the ROE have been trying for a very long time\nto repeal the ban on civilian possession of bioenergetic jade in\nEspenia. A decade ago, I would’ve said that was impossible.\nBut admittedly, public perception and attitudes have shifted\nover the years.”\nGrowing mainstream acceptance of Kekonese healing\npractices, the long-standing and consistent marketing strategy\nof WBH Focus, worldwide pay-per-view broadcasts of\njadesports events in Marcucuo, advances in the safety and\neffectiveness of SN2, and now, Green Bone abilities being\ndisplayed in dramatic fashion on movie theater screens to rapt\naudiences—all those forces together had transformed jade in\nthe eyes of Espenians, a majority of whom now believed it\nshould be regulated instead of outlawed.\nAmbassador Lonard tapped her fingers lightly against her\nknee. “The decriminalization bill will be voted on in the\nNational Assembly next month. If it passes, it still has to be\nsigned into law by Premier Waltor. He could choose to oppose\nit by exercising an executive veto. On the other hand, if he\nwere to publicly support the bill before the vote happens, its\napproval would be almost guaranteed.”\nThe cleverest Espenians were like Fists in their own way,\nShae thought—wielding words and money like moon blades\nand talon knives. Lonard smiled with cool persuasiveness. “If\nyou were to assist us with the problem on Euman Island for\nthe sake of everyone’s safety, I’m confident the premier would\nensure the smooth passage of legislation that’s certain to\nbenefit your business interests.”"

A few fortunate bright spots\nin No Peak’s business—the rebounding real estate market,\ngrowth in the city of Toshon, and successes in the film\nindustry—had made up for some of the damage incurred as a\nresult of the clan losing all its prospects in Shotar. But there\nwas no question that the long-term legal security of the clan’s\nEspenian holdings was needed more than ever. She’d\nunderestimated Lonard’s understanding. The ambassador was\nnot making an ignorant request, but a fully knowledgeable\none. Colonel Basso grunted in smug agreement and crossed\nhis arms.\nShae let a pause hang in the air before responding. She’d\nwaited more than a decade for what she was about to say. She\nwasn’t going to rush. “Since we’re discussing Kekonese\ninterests in Espenia, it’s only fair that I also say a few things\nabout Espenian interests in Kekon.” She leaned forward.\n“Twenty years ago, an Ygutanian spy plane was shot down\nover Euman Island, raising fears of Ygutanian aggression. In\nresponse, Espenia expanded its naval base despite widespread\npublic opposition, and it also increased its intelligence assets\nin Kekon. At the height of the Slow War, you had more spies\nhere than our government ever suspected. ROE military\nintelligence learned of a planned terrorist attack that would kill\nthe leaders of all the Green Bone clans and incite a foreign-\nbacked uprising that would destabilize the nation.”\nShae remembered as if it were yesterday the moment she’d\nseen the collapsed building and the sight of so many dead\nbodies, knowing her husband and her brother were under the\nrubble. Her voice was entirely calm, a mask over her rage.\n“Instead of sharing this information, the Espenian military\nallowed the Janloon bombing to occur and for hundreds of\npeople to die. If the attack had succeeded in destroying the\nclans, the ROE was prepared to step into the power vacuum\nand exert proxy control over Kekon. By not tipping its hand,\nROE agents were able to capture an enemy operative named\nVastik eya Molovni, who yielded a trove of information about\nYgutan’s nekolva program.”\nAmbassador Lonard’s reply was bluntly dismissive. “I’ve\nheard all this unsubstantiated conjecture before.”\n“It’s not unsubstantiated,” Shae said. “It’s taken years, but\nmy people have gathered enough firsthand accounts to paint a\nfull picture of what actually happened—including evidence\nthat places Vastik eya Molovni in Janloon on the day of the\nbombing and an eyewitness report of him being captured by\nthe ROE.” She gazed steadily at the two Espenian officials.\n“How many more protestors would be on Euman Island right\nnow, if they knew the Espenian government allowed, even\nhoped for, the Janloon bombing? That our supposed allies\nseized the man who was responsible for the attack and secretly\nused him for their own purposes, denying justice to the\nKekonese people?”\nColonel Basso sputtered for a second before leveling an"

        "text": "seized the man who was responsible for the attack and secretly\nused him for their own purposes, denying justice to the\nKekonese people?”\nColonel Basso sputtered for a second before leveling an\naffronted glare. “The Espenian military has protected your\ncountry for decades. The number of lives tragically lost in the\nbombing was small compared to the many that were saved by\nintelligence gathered on the Ygutanian threat.”\n“Of course, Espenian lives have always been worth far\nmore to you than Kekonese ones,” Shae said. “But as the\nambassador pointed out, attitudes have shifted over the years.\nPremier Waltor’s political rivals have been questioning his\ntrack record during the Slow War. He was deputy premier at\nthe time of the Janloon bombing, and he later played a key role\nin the creation of the Lybon Act. He might not want to be\nassociated with so many dead civilians while campaigning\nduring this election year. Nor would he appreciate scrutiny\ninto Agent M not being a defector at all. Torture and\npharmaceutical interrogation of captured prisoners of war are\nboth outlawed by international conventions signed by the\nROE.”\nThe polished pleasantry had left Ambassador Lonard’s\nmanner. Her thin nostrils flared with vexation, and there was\ndoubt and rapid calculation in her eyes. Nevertheless, she\nresponded with a defiant lack of concern. “All of your\naccusations are related to events that happened over a decade\nago. Yes, if you were determined to create a public stink about\nthem, you could do so. It would damage relations between our\ncountries’ governments, but the Espenian voter is not going to\ncare about—”\n“Operation Firebreak,” said Niko.\nShae swung a look over her shoulder at her nephew’s\nunexpected lapse in decorum. Throughout the meeting thus\nfar, he’d been a proper silent observer, but his outburst caused\nboth of the Espenians to snap their gazes over to him in\nsurprise.\n“This is my nephew, Kaul Nikoyan.” Shae offered a\nbelated introduction even as she hid her displeasure at his\nbewildering interruption and tried to make it seem deliberate.\n“He has something to add to the conversation.”\n“Operation Firebreak,” Niko repeated, speaking in uneven\nbut passable Espenian. “That’s not old news. Maybe it could\ncause a public stink, as you say, that would be more interesting\nto Espenians.”\nColonel Basso nearly rose from his chair. “What do you\nknow about—”\nNiko stared back at the large Espenian military officer with\nan expression that Shae found disquieting. Niko’s face\nresembled Lan’s, but his stare was like Hilo’s.\n“Kekonese Green Bones were hired as contractors to help\nfight in Espenia’s wars. I was one of them. And I know\nothers.”\nAfter four years, Shae still regularly wished for her jade.\nShe felt strange whenever someone mistakenly addressed her\nas “Kaul-jen,” but even stranger when they said, “Ms. Kaul.”\nShe often woke up with the vaguely panicked feeling that she\nwas missing something vital, and sometimes she still reached\nfor her jade abilities instinctively only to grasp at nothing, like\ntrying to move a phantom limb.

Most of all, at moments like\nthese, she wished she still possessed the advantage of\nPerception. The foreigners were making no further pretense at\nthis being a friendly conversation. Their expressions were\nuneasy and deeply guarded. Niko gazed back at them without\nsaying anything more.\nShae no longer had her jade senses, but she did have\ninstincts honed from decades of reading the clouds.\n“Ambassador. Colonel. It seems our countries are closer than\never, since our relationship is based on so many old secrets.”\nShae stood. Niko stood with her. “The No Peak clan won’t\nsend Fists to break up the Euman Standoff,” she told the\nforeigners. “It’s true what you said earlier. Green Bones aren’t\nparagons of the Divine Virtues. For all our abilities, we’re only\nhuman, and often fail to live up to our own ideals. But we\naren’t vassals who would break aisho for Espenian\nconvenience.\n“I propose a different bargain. We’ll let go of our old\ngrievances over your treatment of Kekon during the Slow War.\nWe’ll keep your secrets about the Janloon bombing, and\nMolovni, and Operation Firebreak—so long as you don’t\nhinder the jade decriminalization bill in the National\nAssembly. Consider it an alliance of inaction.”\nColonel Basso glowered without answering, but\nAmbassador Lonard rose stiffly. “I had hoped,” she said, “that\ngiven No Peak’s economic ties to Espenia, you would be more\ncooperative than your rivals or the Kekonese government. If\nthe Green Bone clans won’t intervene on Euman Island to\ncontrol the populace, then my government won’t be held\nresponsible if Kekonese lives are lost.”\nShae turned to leave. “Ambassador, when it comes to\nKekon and its jade, responsibility is the last thing I expect\nfrom your people.”\n_______\nWhen they were back in the car, Shae instructed the driver to\ntake them to Tia’s school. There was still half an hour before\nclasses were done for the day, so they sat in the car under the\nshade of a tree, windows rolled down to let in a breeze.\nNiko broke the awkward silence. “I’m sorry for my\nrudeness during the meeting, Aunt Shae. I thought it was\nimportant that I speak up in that moment, but I should’ve told\nyou everything I knew beforehand.”\n“Yes, you should have,” Shae rebuked him. “If your\nknowledge of Operation Firebreak might’ve been important in\nany way during the discussion, then you were wrong not to\nbring it up with your Weather Man well in advance.”\n“I understand my mistake.” Niko hunched forward. After a\nminute of castigated silence, he explained, “Operation\nFirebreak is what I was sent to carry out when I worked for\nGSI. Years ago, the Espenian government began reducing its\nmilitary use of jade and drawing down its involvement in\noverseas conflicts. Secretly, though, it hired Jim Sunto’s\ncompany to fight wars against Deliverantism and Ygutanian\ninfluence around the world.”"

Secretly, though, it hired Jim Sunto’s\ncompany to fight wars against Deliverantism and Ygutanian\ninfluence around the world.”\n“Sunto told you this?” Shae asked.\nNiko shook his head. “Not directly. We had to sign a lot of\nnondisclosure forms and we weren’t allowed to talk about\nassignments to anyone outside of GSI, but many of us figured\nit out piecemeal from things we heard. I spent some time\ndigging into it afterward.” Niko avoided meeting her gaze.\n“I’m not proud of what I was involved in.”\n“That’s no excuse,” Shae replied, although her annoyance\nwas already fading. Seeing the guilt in her nephew’s curled\nshoulders, she wanted to reach across the seat, to hug him\ntightly the way she used to when he was a little boy and would\ncome to her for comfort. She wanted to tell him that she\nunderstood what it took to leave, and to come back. There was\npride and shame in both of those decisions. Niko’s reasons and\nexperiences had been different from hers, and so were his\nregrets, but she wished she could offer him something that\nwould smooth the premature lines on his young face.\n“Niko-se,” she said, “there’re a lot of things I’ve done in\nmy life that I don’t want to talk about. Every week, I ask the\ngods for their understanding and forgiveness. And yet, when I\nwalk out of the temple, I still have to make decisions that\nmight stack up even more against me. I’m not sure there’s any\nother way to be a leader in a Green Bone clan.”\nNiko looked out the window toward the school building.\nTwo years ago, Shae and Woon had come to the obvious but\nnonetheless difficult conclusion that Tia would not do well in\nKaul Du Academy, that they should honor their daughter’s\nwishes and allow her to continue on a scholastic track instead\nof training her to become a Green Bone. It had been the right\nchoice, Shae told herself. Tia loved Janloon North Hills\nPrimary, the school Ru had also attended.\nA shadow passed over Niko’s face as he gazed across the\nparking lot to the entrance. Shae wondered if he was thinking\nof Ru, imagining him coming out of the front doors so the\nbrothers could bike home together. She could see the white\nscar down the front of Niko’s left ear, where the cartilage had\nbeen stitched back into place.\nWhen Shae had come back to Kekon from her years\nabroad, she’d done so reluctantly, doubtfully, still trying to\navoid being drawn into the clan business. Niko demonstrated\nno such uncertainty. From the moment he’d set the talon knife\nto his own flesh, he hadn’t wavered from his decision to rise\nwithin the clan. Anden seemed to be the only one capable of\ngetting him to relax on occasion, but Shae’s cousin had\nconfided to her, with worry, “Sometimes, I’m not sure Niko\nthinks of himself anymore. That’s why no amount of work or\nhumiliation bothers him.”\nStudying the young man’s troubled expression, Shae’s\nheart ached. She wished Lan could see his son. She knew he"

        "text": "humiliation bothers him.”\nStudying the young man’s troubled expression, Shae’s\nheart ached. She wished Lan could see his son. She knew he\nwould be proud, but perhaps sad as well. He would ask what\nShae asked now. “Is this really what you want, Niko? Do you\nwant to become the Pillar?”\nNiko didn’t answer right away. “Aunt Shae,” he said at\nlast, with quiet conviction, “while I was away from Kekon, I\nrealized there are only two types of people in the world. It’s\nnot Green Bones and non–Green Bones. It’s those who have\npower and those who don’t.”\nHer nephew turned toward her with a distant gaze that\nmade him seem as if he were standing on the other side of a\nwide valley. “Even with jade, we’re not guaranteed a place in\nthat first group. If the clans stop defining the meaning of jade,\nthen others will take that power from us. They’ll amplify all\nthe worst parts and preserve none of the good.”\nShae gave a nod of silent understanding. Niko had put into\nwords something she’d felt for a long time—a sense that she\nstruggled not only against the Mountain and all the other\nenemies of the clan, but against something even larger and\nmore inexorable.\nNiko lowered his gaze to his hands. “I thought I could\nescape and find some other meaning in my life. But if the clan\ncrumbles, either quickly or slowly, if it becomes as obsolete\nand irrelevant as people like Jim Sunto believe, then\neverything that made me, including my father’s murder and\nmy mother’s execution, would be meaningless. Every drop of\nblood spilled, every sacrifice made, every child ever trained to\nwear jade as a Green Bone warrior of Kekon over centuries of\nhistory … That’s what the Pillar carries. That’s our power, and\nours alone.” He looked back toward the school with a small,\nsad smile. “Ru tried so hard to tell me that I was a selfish fool\nto run away from it. He was right.”\nShae was filled with a nameless, foreboding fearfulness for\nher nephew. Niko was still young—too young, she thought, to\nbe so clear-eyed and grim of character. Yet he’d already\ncontemplated the legacy of the clan and the weight of\nleadership far more than Lan or Hilo or herself at his age. Shae\nand her brothers had grown up with the sentimental\nexpectations that came from being the grandchildren of the\nTorch of Kekon, heirs to the clan following a generation of\nvictory, peace, and national reconstruction. They had each, in\ntheir own way, been forced into their positions and done the\nbest they could.\nNiko had grown up with his eyes open to war and cruelty.\nHe’d stepped away from everything he’d known to find an\neven more dark and tangled wilderness beyond, and his return\nwas an unflinching choice, made without the sentimentality of\nlove or honor.

Shae got out of the car and stood by the\nbike racks. She waved when she saw Tia. Her daughter said\ngoodbye to two of her friends and came jogging up, her\nbackpack bouncing on her shoulders, the ears of her puppy-\nshaped knit hat swinging from side to side. Tia’s twelfth\nbirthday was approaching and she’d been begging for a pet, a\ndog to finally replace poor old Koko, who’d died a few\nmonths after his master, too heartbroken to live.\n“Ma,” Tia exclaimed. “Guess what? I got a part in the\nschool play!” She looked over Shae’s shoulder and said, more\nshyly, “Hi, Niko.” Tia was always a bit reticent around her\neldest cousin, who was fifteen years older than her.\n“Hey, little cousin,” Niko said brightly. “I like your hat.”\nTia smiled and relaxed, and they walked to the car, chatting,\nleaving Shae to follow a few paces behind, watching them.\nCHAPTER\n54\nMaster Plans\nthe twenty-sixth year, seventh month\nA\nnden watched the news on television alongside Shae and\nmost of the staff from the Weather Man’s office, all crowded\ninto the main boardroom on the top floor of the clan’s Ship\nStreet building. Even Woon Papidonwa and Hami Tumashon,\nwho were both retired but who’d dedicated so many years of\ntheir lives to the clan, were in the room, chatting amicably in a\nway they never had when they’d been the Weather Man’s\nShadow and the Master Luckbringer.\nIt was late in the evening Janloon time, midmorning in\nAdamont Capita, when NA3882, a repeal on the twenty-four-\nyear-long ban on civilian possession of bioenergetic jade,\npassed in the National Assembly by a narrow margin. When\nKNB’s foreign correspondent reported the results on-screen,\ncheers broke out and celebratory bottles of hoji were opened.\nStarting tomorrow, the No Peak clan could expect to save\nmillions of dien in legal fees alone. The use of jade in\nhealthcare, martial practice, and entertainment was sure to\ngrow, along with the clan’s investment interests in all of those\nareas. Dozens of additional visas would be filed for Green\nBones to work or study in Espenia. Meanwhile, the Horn\nwould quietly begin to move additional jade into Espenia to\nbolster the clan’s military strength and allies.\nAnden used the phone in the conference room to call Cory\nDauk, the president of the Kekonese Association of Espenia,\nto congratulate him on the victory they’d been working toward\nfor over a decade. Up until the day of the vote, the KAE had\nbeen lobbying politicians and running ads produced by WBH\nFocus in all major media outlets. The outcome had been far\nfrom assured. Several Crews, wanting neither to lose the black\nmarket in jade and shine, nor see the Kekonese grow any\nstronger, had mounted their own secret campaign to defeat the\nlegislation by bribing and threatening policymakers, ad\nexecutives, KAE members, and anyone else who spoke out in"

Work in movies or\njadesports. That’s where all the money is now anyway, right?”\nAnden said, “If you find the next Danny Sinjo, let my\nsister-in-law know.”\n“My son loves that movie!” Cory exclaimed. “We’ve seen\nit three times.”\nThe box office success of Black & Green on both sides of\nthe Amaric last year had been an unexpected tipping point in\nthe long public relations battle, catapulting Danny Sinjo to\ninternational stardom and creating a wave of favorable\nmainstream interest in Green Bone culture. Much attention\nwas paid to Sinjo’s thrilling action sequences, which were\ndone entirely without visual effects, stunt doubles, or wires.\nThe movie was a crowd-pleasing buddy cop story in which a\nrakish Fist from the fictional One Sky clan, paired with a fish-\nout-of-water IBJCS-trained Espenian secret service agent,\nfought their way through Ygutanian ex-military underbosses\non the way to capturing a notorious drug kingpin.\nCinema Shore, and thusly No Peak, was raking in money\nfrom what was now a planned franchise.

Wen was\nmissing from the gathering on Ship Street tonight because she\nwas presenting the top award at the Janloon Film Festival,\nwhich had grown considerably since its inception and was now\nan event that the Pillarman attended with a clan budget.\n“I hope your son knows that 2 Black 2 Green comes out\nthis summer,” Anden said to Cory. “I might be able to lay my\nhands on a signed poster and send it to him.”\n“That would be mass toppers, crumb.” Cory stopped. It\nseemed he’d been about to say something else about his son,\nor to ask after Anden’s family, but he held back. Ever since\nhe’d learned of Anden’s role in the murder of Jon Remi,\nthere’d been another wall between them, one that Cory kept in\nplace by always ending the conversation before it became too\npersonal and turned to his own wife and children. Anden was\ndisappointed but not surprised; Cory was Espenian after all. It\nwas just like him to wish for a difficult thing but maintain a\ndistance from the way it was accomplished.\nAnden rescued him. “Please give my respect and\ncongratulations to your mother.”\n“Thanks, Anden.

        "text": "congratulations to your mother.”\n“Thanks, Anden. I will.” A pause. “May the gods shine\nfavor on No Peak.”\nAfter Anden hung up with Cory, Terun Bin thrust a plastic\ncup of hoji into his hands. “This all started with you, Dr.\nEmery,” Terun said. “You were No Peak’s man in Espenia\nbefore there was even an office there.” They drank to the\nclan’s victory.\nAnden did not know the Master Luckbringer well, but in\nall their interactions, he’d been struck by how quickly and\nenergetically the man spoke, and how much more quickly his\nmind worked. Terun was a career Luckbringer, starting on the\nbusiness side of the clan right out of college. Now, he was one\nof the highest-ranked members of No Peak despite not coming\nfrom a strong Green Bone family and having never worn more\nthan a single jade stone in his life. This would’ve been an\ninsurmountable disadvantage in Janloon twenty years ago, but\nthe Weather Man had wisely sent Terun on a longterm\nassignment to Espenia before bringing him back to Kekon and\nrotating him through several Ship Street positions, including\nmaking him the Sealgiver for several years, so by now he\nknew every part of the clan’s business.\n“I’ll need to talk to you about how the jade medicine\nclinics were expanded,” Terun said. “They’re the best\nprecedent to help us determine how to handle overseas martial\neducation. Can you believe I already have six requests sitting\non my desk from teachers and private trainers anticipating the\npassage of the bill? They’re requesting No Peak patronage to\nopen schools in Espenia to teach the jade disciplines to Keko-\nEspenians and even to foreigners.”\nAnden wasn’t surprised to hear this. The market for\nmartial gyms and coaching was crowded in Janloon. Even in\nsmaller cities like Lukang and Toshon, a trainer needed top\ncredentials from Wie Lon Temple School or Kaul Dushuron\nAcademy, along with years of experience as a Fist and\nconnections within the major clans. However, in Espenia, even\na relatively average senior Fist could open a school and take\non students. Some had already done so years ago, albeit\ncovertly.\nAnden began to tell Terun that he would be happy to offer\nwhatever knowledge he could, when a shout rose up from the\nhallway. “The Pillar! The Pillar is here!” When Hilo walked\ninto the boardroom half a minute later, the jovial noise cut out\nin a ripple of clasped hands and tilted salutes. Hilo’s visits to\nShip Street were uncommon. “Kaul-jen,” several Luckbringers\nmurmured. “Our blood for the Pillar.”\nHilo’s gaze traveled through the crowded space. A slow\nsmile curved the side of his mouth. “Don’t stop the fun for my\nsake,” he said. “I just couldn’t stand to think my sister was\nstaying up partying while I went to bed.” He quieted the\nburble of laughter by raising his hands. “The truth is that of\ncourse I came to congratulate all of you. I don’t come here\nvery often, but that’s because I have such a strong Weather\nMan. Even when we don’t agree, she does what’s right for the"

Even when we don’t agree, she does what’s right for the\nclan.”\nHilo went up to Shae and saluted her. “Far do your\nenemies flee, Kaul-jen,” he declared, uttering the traditional\nGreen Bone congratulations to a victorious warrior, before\nputting an arm over Shae’s shoulder and kissing her brow.\nEven though the Weather Man could no longer wear jade and\nher triumph had been a distant political one decades in the\nmaking, echoes broke out at once, and people stomped their\nfeet and raised their cups of hoji in jubilant agreement. The\nWeather Man looked deeply embarrassed. As people returned\nto their own conversations, Anden saw Shae muttering to her\nbrother, “You always did have to upstage me at parties.”\nHe’s like himself again, Anden thought, turning away to\nhide his heavy-hearted relief.\nRu’s death had devastated all of them, but it had nearly\nruined Hilo. He’d withdrawn and lost interest in life. The\nPillar who used to want to personally handle every important\nissue in the clan no longer cared about anything. For nearly a\nyear, Hilo left the running of No Peak to his Weather Man and\nHorn, who had to guiltily hound him for even simple things.\nHe wouldn’t leave the house for days, or would spend hours\ndriving aimlessly around the city, sometimes picking a\ndirection and ending up in the countryside and sleeping in the\ncar. A few times he parked the Duchesse in Mountain territory,\nbaiting someone to attack him for being there. To Aben Soro’s\ncredit, no one did, although on several occasions Lott Jin had\nto frantically scramble to find out where the Pillar had gone.\nAnden was not the only one worried that his cousin, only in\nhis fifties, was already going the way of Grandda, sinking\nirretrievably into loss and regret.\nSlowly, however, he’d reemerged. Perhaps it was because\nhe and Wen leaned on each other so much in their mutual\ngrief. The rest of the family would see them walking around\nthe estate, or eating at the patio table in uncharacteristic\nsilence, or going to Widow’s Park together to visit the family\nmemorial. Or perhaps Niko’s return to the family drew Hilo\nback to life; instructing his nephew in the skills of clan\nleadership forced the Pillar to return to his responsibilities in a\nway that felt personal and necessary. Over time, he began to\nsmile again, to train, to attend to clan affairs.\nAnd he took a gradual interest in things that hadn’t\ninterested him before. Without any prompting, he gave a large\nendowment to the Charitable Society for Jade Nonreactivity.\nHe donated to the Janloon public school board and paid for a\nnew auditorium at Jan Royal University. Although he was well\nknown for avoiding politicians, he unexpectedly appeared\nbefore them, sometimes with Wen by his side, to voice his\nsupport for legislative proposals that he’d never previously\ndeemed to be important: A bill to prevent employment and pay\ndiscrimination against stone-eyes and those with mixed blood.\nA return of thousands of hectares of traditional tribal land to"

A limited allowance for the Kekonese military\nto use medical-grade SN2 in conjunction with its training\nprograms, and to lower the threshold of martial education\nrequired of adult recruits into the Golden Spider Company—\nmeasures proposed by Jim Sunto fifteen years ago that Hilo\nand nearly everyone else had opposed at the time, but were\nnow being reconsidered given the gradual destigmatizing of\nshine.\nSome observers, particularly those aligned with the\nMountain, muttered that the Pillar of No Peak was growing\nsoft, pandering to the sentiment of jadeless reformists because\nhe kept too many close advisors who were not typical Green\nBones, or not Green Bones at all. Others praised the clan for\nbeing in touch with current social concerns and setting an\nexample of philanthropic leadership.\nAnden knew the truth. His cousin did all these things for\nRu. All of Ru’s social causes, the arguments he used to make\nto his father about the good the clan could do, the things he’d\nwanted Hilo to care about that his father had humored or\nignored—they had taken on a different meaning. Now they\nwere deeds Hilo could do for Ru that he had not done during\nRu’s short life, that would’ve made Ru proud of his clan and\nhappy to be a Kaul—the only way left for Hilo to prove he still\nloved his son.\n“Uncle Anden.” Maik Cam came up to Anden, perhaps\nnoticing him mulling his plastic cup of hoji too seriously.\nKehn’s son was proudly sporting a new jade ring and three\nnew beads on a platinum chain—understated and professional,\na good look for a young lawyer. He’d won his latest spoils in a\nrecent duel against a disgruntled member of the Mountain clan\nwho’d not taken well to the filing of a trademark infringement\ncase. Cam had all the famous greenness of his father’s family\nbut his scholastic leanings came from his mother, Lina, a\nteacher. He touched his forehead in casual salute and said,\n“Thanks again for overseeing my duel. I really appreciate it.”\n“You’re fast with the blade,” Anden complimented him.\n“I’m glad you won. I’d much rather be patching up your\nopponent than you.”\nUnder new laws, clean-bladed duels required the presence\nof at least two witnesses, one from each side, along with\nsomeone with emergency medical training. As the most\nprominent Green Bone physician in the No Peak clan, Anden’s\nschedule was peppered with requests to attend contests. That\nwas not the only change to dueling custom. A twenty-four-\nhour waiting period was now required between the issuing of\nthe challenge and the fight itself. Only Green Bones were\nallowed to duel using moon blades or talon knives, and there\nwere limits as to how much jade a combatant could take from\nan opponent who conceded defeat.\nPrevious attempts to place restrictions on the tradition of\ncleanbladed dueling had always failed. The shocking\ndifference this time was that Kaul Hilo had publicly supported\nreform. He even went so far as to admit that some of the many"

He even went so far as to admit that some of the many\nduels he’d fought in his life had not been strictly necessary.\nGreen Bones, he said, could gain combat experience and earn\njade with less injury and death, and jadeless citizens should be\nencouraged to try to solve disputes in other ways. His own\nson, Hilo declared, might be alive today if he’d not felt the\nneed to duel, or if the duel had been delayed or better\ncontrolled.\nThe Pillar’s astonishing shift in position had caused fierce\ndebate in the Green Bone community, but even the\ntraditionalist Koben family couldn’t argue against it without\nseeming ridiculous, as Hilo had fought more duels and won\nmore jade in his life than any of them. The Pillar wielded his\nwill toward the issue with the same amiable, dangerous\npersuasiveness with which he ran the clan, so what he wished\nfor happened quickly.\nCam grinned. “The other fellow could’ve beaten me if he\nwasn’t so exhausted from dealing with our lawsuit,” he said,\nmanaging to be both polite and cleverly self-aggrandizing at\nthe same time. Cam was burly and broad-shouldered, as tall as\nhis father had been, but unlike Kehn, he had a quick smile and\nsense of humor. “Where’s Jirhu?” he asked Anden. “Is he not\nhere tonight?”\n“No,” Anden said. “This is …” He glanced around at the\ngathering. “A bit too much of a clan occasion for his liking.”\nHe and Jirhuya had come to a long-standing compromise.\nAnden’s boyfriend came to Kaul family gatherings, where he\ngot along with everyone despite being a little more reserved\nthan usual, but he avoided large No Peak clan functions. Jirhu\nfaithfully wore a ring of bluffer’s jade on his right thumb and\ndid not hide their relationship, and he was accepted by the\nKauls because of his importance to Anden, but he was not\nassociated with No Peak in any other way.\nOver time, Anden had come to appreciate what had\ninitially seemed to him to be Jirhu’s unreasonable concerns\nabout the optics of patronage. In fact, he was thankful his\nboyfriend’s career and daily concerns had nothing to do with\nthe world of Green Bones. Jirhu was a refuge from the clan.\nHe listened to Anden’s troubles and encouraged him but never\npressed for details or demanded explanations about clan\naffairs. In return, Anden didn’t pressure Jirhuya to interact\nwith No Peak beyond what he was comfortable with, not even\npicking up the phone to solve a simple problem through a Kaul\nfamily contact rather than accomplishing it some harder way\non his own.\n“Niko,” Cam called out, and motioned his cousin over to\njoin them. Seeing Cam, Niko’s face relaxed into a smile. He\ncame over and embraced both Anden and Cam warmly and let\nCam refill his cup. Despite his size and tough looks, Cam was\nnaturally gifted at putting people at ease.

Let’s sneak out together so it\nlooks like we’re talking about important clan issues.” He put a\nhand on his cousin’s shoulder and they made their way toward\nthe elevators. Anden smiled, and when Hilo said, “What is it?”\nhe shook his head and said, “Nothing, Hilo-jen. It was a good\nevening.”\n_______\nThe world came crashing down in the form of a simple\nnewspaper clipping that Shae read while waiting for her\ndaughter’s dance practice to finish. Behind the studio’s\nsoundproof windows, the girls leapt and twirled in flowing\nsilks to music she couldn’t hear, but Shae sat immobilized, a\ndeafening roar building in her ears.\nThe Euman Deal.\nShae’s ordeal with the Faltas had given her lasting\nemotional scars and ruined her jade tolerance, but it had also\nleft her with a burning question, the only one the barukan\ncaptors had asked her that she had not been able to answer:\nWhat is the Euman Deal? Tell us about the Euman Deal. She\nshuddered and felt tendrils of panic crawl over her every time\nshe thought about it, yet the demanding questions came back\nto her, swimming into her waking nightmares, taunting her\nyears later.\nWhat’s the Mountain’s big plan? You’re the fucking\nWeather Man of No Peak, you know what Ayt is up to, don’t\nyou?\nShe’d investigated all the Mountain’s tributary businesses\nand assets connected to Euman Island. There was not much: a\nfew properties in the town center, an upscale escort service\ncatering to foreigners, a shipyard. She could find no evidence\nthat any of them might be part of a major deal with the\nbarukan.\nEuman Island was best known for the Espenian naval base.\nHad the Mountain struck a secret alliance with the ROE\nmilitary?

The Matyos are moving money to the\nMountain. What are they getting for it?\nThat part, at least, No Peak’s spies had been able to verify.\nThe Matyos barukan were moving millions of Shotarian sepas\ninto overseas bank accounts. Shae’s informers had long ago\ntold her that Iwe Kalundo, Weather Man of the Mountain, was\ndivesting the clan’s businesses in Ygutan. Perhaps that was\nsimply because he didn’t want Mountain capital tied up in a\ncountry that was losing the Slow War and sliding into political\ninstability, but it seemed the clan was still sitting on the\nproceeds and not reinvesting them elsewhere. It was not like\nAyt to be passive. The Mountain and the Matyos were building\nup a joint hoard of cash and liquid assets. For what purpose?\nNiko had told her that both Jim Sunto and the CEO of\nAnorco, Art Wyles, had part-time homes near GSI’s training\ncompound on Euman Island. Perhaps the Euman Deal had\nsomething to do with those foreigners. Hilo and Lott Jin\nalready had No Peak spies planted in Sunto’s organization, but\nthey hadn’t investigated Wyles directly. Shae had dug up every\nbit of information she could about the man. She had the clan’s\nbranch office in Port Massy keep an open file on him,\ninforming her every time he appeared in the news. Now Shae\nwas looking at an article from yesterday’s Port Massy Post,\nthe story clipped, photocopied, and faxed along with other\nmemos and reports.\nThe article was short. It announced that Art Wyles, newly\nappointed secretary of Foreign Trade, had tendered his\nresignation as president and CEO of Anorco Global\nResources. Although he was not required by law to do so, he\nwould be selling his controlling share to an unnamed private\nKekonese investment firm. The article ended with a statement\nthat Anorco was valued at sixteen billion thalirs and the\nconglomerate’s assets included proprietary offshore\nbioenergetic jade mining technology and Ganlu Solutions\nInternational, a private military company. The deal would\nclose in ninety days.\nThe Euman Deal.\nIn the dance studio, the class ended. The girls saluted their\nteacher and began to mill about, chatting as they gathered their\nbags and shoes. Tia stayed behind with another student to\npractice a section of their routine, leaping with such height and\nelegance that she seemed on the verge of Lightness. She had\nall the natural athleticism of a Green Bone’s daughter,\nchanneled toward warmth and imagination.\nNormally, Shae would get up and gather Tia’s belongings,\nwaving from the window to remind her that they had to get\nhome for dinner, but she remained on the bench, a slow panic\nbeginning to crawl over her as all the pieces fell into place.\nThe “private Kekonese investment firm” cited in the article\nwas the Mountain clan.

Ayt Mada would take over Anorco and become\nthe owner of her own jade mining company, with technology\nand assets completely separate from the Kekon Jade Alliance\nand beholden to no one. She could supply jade to military\nforces and other organizations around the world with no\noversight from other clans. She would also gain control of\nGSI, which had jade-wearing soldiers, training campuses,\nhelicopters, weapons, and gods knew what other military\nassets. Anorco and GSI had offices, personnel, and assets in\nEspenia, so in one swoop, the Mountain would leapfrog No\nPeak’s presence in the ROE. The passage of the bill repealing\nthe ban on jade, which Shae had pursued doggedly for so\nmany years, would now, ironically, benefit the Mountain clan\nmore than anyone else.\nIn exchange for their financial partnership in the Euman\nDeal, Ayt Mada would give the Matyos enough jade and\nmilitary power to assert complete dominance over the\nShotarian underworld, especially in East Oortoko, which was\nrife with organized crime in the wake of Ygutan’s diminishing\ncontrol. She would not only make peace but cement the loyalty\nof the barukan factions in her clan alienated by the Kobens.\nTia came out of the studio. “I’m starved,” she exclaimed as\nshe put on her shoes. “What’s Da going to make for dinner?”\nWhen Shae stood without answering, her daughter looked up\nat her. “What’s wrong?”\n“Nothing, Tia-se,” Shae murmured. “Just … thinking\nabout work.”\nThey walked out to the car, one of Shae’s bodyguards\nfollowing and opening the door for them. Ever since she’d\nstopped wearing jade, she had to put up with having personal\nsecurity at all times. On the drive home, Tia talked about\nrehearsals for the school play, her upcoming math test, brand-\nname jeans she wanted to buy. Shae wasn’t able to hear any of\nit. She was thinking that Ayt’s acquisition of Anorco would be\nlauded as a great national victory, a repatriation of Kekonese\nresources from the hated foreign offshore mining company\nthat thousands of people were protesting against at this very\nmoment.\nPublic support for the Mountain clan would surge during a\nyear of Royal Council elections. Assuming that all the newly\ndistricted seats in Lukang went to politicians loyal to the\ntributary Six Hands Unity clan, the Mountain was poised to\ncontrol a commanding majority of the Royal Council,\nsomething neither clan had been able to accomplish for years.\nWith so much power—military, financial, political—Ayt\nwould install the successor she preferred. She would no longer\nneed the Koben family’s numbers or popularity. Iwe Kalundo’s\ngrand accomplishment as Weather Man would provide ample\njustification for her to bypass her nephew and name her loyal\nsecond-in-command the next Pillar of the Mountain, ensuring\nher will continued to prevail.\nHow had she done it?

This\nwas what it meant, to not send her daughter to the Academy, to\nnot raise her as a Green Bone. Tia lived in a bubble of ordinary\npreteen concerns. Even when she was older, she would never\nfully understand her own parents, or the rest of her family.\n“I’m sorry, it’s … clan things. Nothing for you to worry\nabout,” Shae said as the car pulled up in front of the Weather\nMan’s house. “Go wash up for dinner.”\nTia ran inside, dropping her bag by the door and shouting\nhello to her father as she went up the stairs. Shae followed\nslowly. The house smelled of garlic and spices and cooking\nmeat. Woon came out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on a\ntowel. “I didn’t oversmoke the duck this time,” he said\nproudly. Woon had barely cooked anything before the age of\nfifty but was now far more skilled at it than her. Seeing her\nexpression or Perceiving her churning emotions, he stopped,\nthe smile sliding off his face. Shae went to her husband and\nput her arms around him, laying her head against his broad\nchest without a word.\nIt didn’t matter how quickly No Peak grew or how strong\nits warriors and businesses were.

Shae had explained all of\nher conclusions to them, laying out every aspect of Ayt Mada’s\nmaster stroke. “It’s a brilliant and elegant plan,” she admitted.\nHilo flipped the playing card between his fingers and\nlooked around the room at his family, his closest advisors. “We\nalways knew we’d have to face Ayt directly again, to finish\nwhat was started so long ago,” he said. “All these years of\nslow war between the clans have been about making ourselves\nstrong enough. We became too big to swallow, too big to kill,\nso now Ayt has to gamble with everything she has. The thing\nabout brilliant, elegant plans is that it doesn’t take much to\nfuck them up.”\nShae said, “The Euman Deal closes in less than ninety\ndays.”\n“Then we don’t have a lot of time, obviously,” Hilo said, a\nbit impatiently. “When something has to be done, there’s\nalways a way to do it. So let’s decide what that is.”\nHours of discussion ensued on that night and the following\nnights. Phone calls were made, flights were booked, meetings\nwere arranged.

This was the last great\ngamble either clan could make.\nTo Shae’s surprise, her brother didn’t seem to share her\ndread, at least not outwardly. Hilo gave the orders and made\nthe arrangements that would doom them or save them, but he\nalso talked about plans for the summer, possibly taking Wen,\nNiko, and Jaya on vacation for a week before everything\nbecame too busy. “I’ve heard good things about the Bittari\nValley in Tomascio,” he said. “You and Woon and Tia could\nrent the villa next door.” He commissioned renovation plans\nfor the estate, saying that the courtyard looked dated and they\nneeded a bigger home theater and a nicer training hall. He\nspent many hours with Niko, in conversations that Shae was\nnot privy to.\n“What else is there to be worried about?” he asked her,\nwhen she expressed incredulity at his lack of concern as they\nsat on the patio together one night after the heat had burned off\nthe last of the drizzly Northern Sweat. “Don’t you remember\nwe once sat out here all night before New Year’s Day, thinking\nwe might both soon be dead? And here we are.

Don’t tell Wen.”\nShae looked up at the sky that stretched over the lights of\nthe city. She couldn’t share her brother’s apparent equanimity.\nNo Peak was everything she’d once hoped it would become—\na powerful, modern, international entity, green at its core but\nfar more than the sum of its jade or warriors. It was too\ndifficult to wrap her mind around the possibility that after a\nlifetime of striving, after everything they had accomplished\nand sacrificed, they might still lose to an enemy they’d held at\nbay for decades, like an ancient city buried at the pinnacle of\nits glory by the volcano whose shadow had loomed\nthreateningly over it for so long.\nTia is still too young. She still needs me.\n“How do you do it, Hilo?” she wondered out loud. “How\ndo you handle this world when you don’t believe in the gods?”\nHilo exhaled twin streams of smoke and leaned back\ncontentedly, his vision sliding out of focus. She knew he was\nstretching out his Perception, perhaps sensing where everyone\nwas as he made a circuit of the Kaul estate in his mind—Wen\nupstairs in the main house, Woon and Tia across the courtyard,\ntheir mother doing slow stretching exercises in the garden,\nLott and Niko engaged in evening training with a small group\nof Fists in the field behind the Horn’s residence. Or perhaps\nHilo was casting his jade senses even farther out, letting the\nsurrounding energetic burble of the city wash over him,\nsurveying it from a distance like a lion on a rock.\n“How do we do it?” Hilo sighed deeply. “You of all people\nalready know the answer to that, Shae. We don’t handle this\nworld. We make it handle us.”\nCHAPTER\n55\nThe Little Knives\nK\naul Jaya chose several of her best Green Bones and\ntraveled from her peninsula base in Toshon to the city of\nLukang. Before she left, she spoke to her father over the\nphone. The Pillar told her, “Lott Jin is going to send the Juen\ntwins down there with another twenty of our warriors. They’ll\nget there tomorrow evening.”\n“I’ll have it taken care of by then,” Jaya assured him.\n“They can help clean up.”\n“Don’t be so cocky,” Hilo said. “Cleaning up is the hardest\npart.”\n“I’m joking, Da,” Jaya said. She was only half joking. She\nwanted to accomplish her task quickly and independently, to\nprove to her father that she and her people could be trusted\nwith difficult missions and didn’t need help from Janloon.

If it were up to her father, Jaya\nthought, he would have her back in Janloon, living at home\nand patrolling some safe and boring district like Green Plain\nwhere he could keep an eye on her. After Ru’s death, he’d\nwanted her to move back right away. She’d had to argue and\nbeg to be allowed to stay in Toshon.\n“Jio Somu is an old wolf by now,” Hilo reminded her. “He\nbetrayed his own uncle, and he’s hung on as Pillar of Six\nHands Unity ever since. His Fists and Fingers are trained by\nthe Mountain. You shouldn’t underestimate him.”\n“Don’t worry, I know what’s at stake.”\nHer father said, “How often have you been training? When\nwas the last time you dueled?”\n“Every day, Da. And I dueled last month—followed all the\nnew rules and everything. A former Fist from the old Jo Sun\nclan, she was pretty good, wicked fast, and I got two new studs\nout of it.” Her father was silent, and Jaya said, “Don’t worry\nso much, Da.” He didn’t use to be like this.\n“After this, we should talk about when you’ll move back to\nJanloon. I miss you, Jaya-se.”\n“I miss you too, Da. I love you.” She flipped her phone\nclosed and went out to the parked Brock Compass. Eiten Asha\nand Noyu Kain were packing the last of their luggage,\nweapons, and gear into the ample trunk. “Leave the cooler in\nthe back seat,” Icho Tenn called from inside the SUV. “It has\nall the drinks and snacks.”\nThe drive to Lukang took most of the day. The train\ncould’ve gotten them there faster, and in another two years,\nwhen construction of the national high-speed rail line was\ncomplete, the trip would take under two hours. But\nconsidering everything they needed to bring, driving was the\nonly option. It was slow going at times—many of the roads in\nthe peninsula were single lane, and not always well\nmaintained. But the Brock handled the occasional potholes\nwith ease and they were in no rush.\nThey stopped along the way to take photos of the coastal\nscenery and have lunch in the small town of Yanshu.

The summer heat grew thick by\nmidafternoon, when the roads widened into Kekon’s flatter\ncentral countryside. The four young Green Bones blasted\nShotopop music from the open windows and talked about\nfights they’d been in, movies they’d recently seen, the best and\nworst sex they’d had, and whether summer and low-residency\nstudents at Kaul Du Academy could be considered real\ngraduates or not. All four of them came from traditional Green\nBone families and scorned those who were “light green,” but\nas Tenn said, “Not everyone can be cut.” They all agreed that\nDanny Sinjo was cut, but the other actor, the Espenian, was\nobviously using stunt doubles and wires.

        "text": "scene on the rooftop. Have you ever seen a foreigner use\nLightness like that? No way.”\nJaya rested an arm outside the open window, drumming\nthe beat of the music on the side of the Brock, laughing and\njoking in high spirits despite the fact that she was driving\ntoward certain danger. Or perhaps because of that, the joy of\nlife was greater. She was proud of what she’d accomplished\nover the past four years. Toshon was not nearly as big and\nimportant a city as Janloon, but it had grown and contributed\nto the clan at an important time, and it was where she’d risen\ninto being a Fist on her own merits. People in the far south\ncared little about the clan dynamics in the capital. Even though\nthe rivalry between the Mountain and No Peak affected the\nentire country, southerners had their own concerns.\nThe biggest problems were unemployment and drugs. Jaya\nspent more time than she liked on the phone with her aunt\nShae and the people in the Weather Man’s office, advocating\nfor patronage for new Lantern Men in the area. She\ncoordinated with the municipal government and the police to\ncrack down on crime and lure more businesses and visitors\nfrom up north down to the peninsula. And she went after the\ndrug trade—sweet flour, sand, buzz, and of course, shine—\nwith the brutal efficiency of not just a Janlooner, but a Kaul.\nThis was one area where Jaya did not at all mind leaning on\nher father’s reputation. Drug dealers had one thumb cut off for\na first offense, the other thumb removed for a second\ntransgression, and their throat opened for a third.\nShe assembled a core group of up-and-coming Fists loyal\nto her, young Green Bones who were known for working hard\nand partying harder. Gray-eyed Eiten Asha, the only other\nwoman on the original team sent from Janloon, was two years\nJaya’s senior and acknowledged as such a tough and capable\nGreen Bone that it would surprise most people to learn she\nwas also heiress to the famous Cursed Beauty hoji company.\nNoyu Kain, the elder brother of Jaya’s Academy classmate\nNoyu Hana, had transferred south to Toshon to work for Jaya\nspecifically. Icho Tenn was a member of the previous ruling\nfamily of the Jo Sun clan; he was the only Toshon-born\nmember of their group, but he got along well with everyone\nand was also deeply loyal to his city. Together, they had\nroughly sixty Fingers who reported to them.\nAs a woman Fist, Jaya could not expect to be\nautomatically obeyed, not even with the amount of jade she\nwore. She didn’t see herself being able to pull off Ayt Mada’s\nauthoritative poise, or her aunt Shae’s cool competence.\nBesides, those aloof old women sat in boardrooms. She would\nhave to find her own style.\nMany of her Fingers initially followed her because she was\nknown for being fun and generous, for holding movie nights\nand group training, for making decisions as a team when it\nwas feasible to do so, which was something that could be\naccomplished in a smaller territory. Using confiscated drug\nmoney, Jaya purchased two large houses that were social\ngathering places for her Green Bones and often the site of"

Using confiscated drug\nmoney, Jaya purchased two large houses that were social\ngathering places for her Green Bones and often the site of\nmuch raucous behavior, drinking, and promiscuity. Shine and\nother drugs were strictly forbidden, however.\nThe first Finger she caught defying her rules, she packed\nhim back to Janloon. The second one, she tied into a chair and\ncut off the jade studs in his ears and nose, leaving him\npermanently disfigured before kicking him out. She never used\nher family name as a weapon but she did not need to; everyone\nmurmured that she was her father’s daughter. Her team was\nknown as the Little Knives, and word of their tight-knit culture\nhad reached even Janloon.\nJaya and her friends arrived at the outskirts of Lukang\nbefore dinner and spent the night at a motel outside the city, so\ntheir arrival was unlikely to be noticed and reported to any of\nthe local Green Bones. The following morning, they had\nbrunch at a roadside noodle shop, then drove to meet up with\nsix more of the Little Knives who’d driven up the previous day\nin two other vehicles. Together, they went to the Big Triple\nclub, where Jio Somu could regularly be found on Fifthdays.\nThe sign on the outside of the building read in big white\nletters: COCKFIGHTS. ARCADE. INTERNET. Tenn circled the block\nand dropped Jaya, Asha, and Kain off on the street corner\nbefore driving away. The three Green Bones walked inside.\nThe Big Triple was a musty old establishment valiantly trying\nto freshen itself up with modern attractions and amenities. To\nthe left was a small cockfight pit with electronic betting\nterminals. This early in the day it was empty except for a\ncouple of bored trainers sitting on benches, talking about their\nbirds and waiting for more people to show up. To the right was\na room with several computer stations behind a counter selling\nsnacks and a poster with the sign displaying the prices in\nfifteen-minute increments.\nJaya strode farther into the room and found Jio Somu,\nPillar of the Six Hands Unity clan, sitting at a circular table in\na booth at the back of the club, having lunch with two of his\nGreen Bones. Three bodyguards stood near them, their hands\nalready on the grips of their pistols and the hilts of their\nknives, jade auras humming. They’d Perceived the No Peak\nFists as soon as they’d walked in the door.\n“Jio-jen,” Jaya said, walking up to the table with a smile\nand saluting respectfully. “My name is Kaul Jayalun, and I’ve\nbeen sent on behalf of my father, the Pillar of No Peak, with\nan important proposal for the Six Hands Unity clan. May I join\nyou?”\nJaya could see that Jio Somu had been handsome in his\nyouth. Now in his midforties, the color in his hair was fading,\nbut he still possessed a strong jaw and taut skin around shrewd\neyes shielded by amber-tinted glasses.

        "text": "but he still possessed a strong jaw and taut skin around shrewd\neyes shielded by amber-tinted glasses. Plenty of people had\ntried to kill Jio over the years, and the paranoia he’d developed\nhad paid off. As one of the only Pillars not in the KJA meeting\non the day of the Janloon bombing, he’d been in a position to\nstrengthen Six Hands Unity in Lukang while other minor clans\nhad struggled and collapsed.\nJio pulled his glasses down and regarded Jaya and her two\nassociates with a mixture of suspicion and amusement. “Since\nwhen does No Peak send its children to make business\nproposals?”\nHis eyes moved up and down, taking her in from head to\ntoe. Jaya was wearing fashionable sneakers, a patterned\nsummer skirt, and a red top with flared sleeves and a scooped\nneckline under a customfitted leather vest that suggested a\nmodern, feminine twist on the traditional Green Bone fighting\nattire. Artfully arranged jade pieces gleamed from her gold\ntorque necklace and armlets.\n“Jio-jen, my words are for your ears only.” Jaya glanced\nmeaningfully at the other people in the club—the gamecock\ntrainers, the waiters, the few other patrons.\nJio raised his eyebrows with curiosity and distrust. Then he\nspoke to his two Green Bone subordinates. “Get those people\nto clear out and then wait by the door and stop anyone else\nfrom coming in.” Jio considered the two young Fists standing\nto either side of Jaya. He did not feel especially threatened—\nhe was more heavily jaded than either of them, but he said to\nJaya, “If your bodyguards stay, then so do mine.”\n“Whatever you like,” Jaya said without concern. As the\nPillar’s lunch companions reluctantly departed, she slid onto\nthe cushioned bench next to Jio. The man’s bodyguards shifted\ncloser, but he waved them back to their spots. Kaul\nHiloshudon would not sacrifice his own beloved daughter in\nan assassination attempt. “May I have some of that cool tea?”\nJaya asked him. “It’s terribly hot in your city today.”\nJio poured Jaya a glass of the citrus-infused tea and slid it\ntoward her, watching her pale throat bob as she drank. When\nshe was done, she wiped the half circle of lipstick from the rim\nof the glass with a finger. “Jio-jen,” she said earnestly, looking\nthe man in the eyes, “Six Hands Unity has been a faithful\ntributary of the Mountain clan for many years. But you’re\nobviously a practical man who puts his own interests first.\nAfter all, you betrayed your uncle and watched him murdered\nin front of you, so you’re willing to be flexible with your\nloyalties.”\nThe bemused, tolerant expression on Jio’s face vanished.\n“Is Kaul Hilo so deluded that after all these years, he thinks he\ncan bribe me for my allegiance?”\nJaya’s eyes widened and she said vehemently, “I swear on\nmy jade that my father wouldn’t insult you by offering any\nsort of bribe! He understands that you’re genuinely loyal to\nAyt Mada. Some would say you’re an even better ally to her\nthan the Kobens. He’s simply, out of courtesy from one Pillar"

He’s simply, out of courtesy from one Pillar\nto another, offering you the opportunity to switch allegiance\nnow and save yourself from sharing the same fate as the\nMountain.” Jaya gave him a winning smile. “He’s sent me to\ntell you that old hag Ayt Mada will soon be on her way out,\nand he would be pleased to put any enmity with Six Hands\nUnity in the past and to accept your oath as a tributary of No\nPeak.”\nJio blinked at Jaya before letting out a rich, throaty laugh.\nThe smile returned to his face. “Jaya-jen,” he said, using her\npersonal name as if they were friends, “your family’s been\ntrying to take down the Mountain for decades. You’ll forgive\nme if I’m quite confident Ayt-jen will be Pillar for many years\nto come.”\n“I’m sorry I can’t give you the details of how exactly No\nPeak is going to bring Ayt down, only my father’s assurance\nthat it’ll happen soon,” Jaya said. “Ayt will be succeeded by\nthe Koben family, and from what I understand, they don’t like\nyou all that much. You’re southerners and they’re northerners,\nand also they look down on the barukan immigrants in your\nclan. So you can’t expect to get the same sort of favored\ntributary status under Ayt Atosho that you enjoy now.” She\ncalled out to Asha and Kain standing a short distance away. “Is\nthere anything else I’m forgetting?”\n“There’s the issue of the embargo, Jaya-jen,” said Asha\nhelpfully.\n“Ah, yes.” Jaya smacked her own forehead and turned\nback to Jio. “Since it seems likely the Royal Council is going\nto normalize relations between Kekon and the Uwiwa Islands,\nshipping traffic will be restored to Lukang, and No Peak still\ncontrols the docks here. So it would be better for you to ally\nyour clan with ours. The alternative, of course, is to go down\nwith Ayt. But why would you want to do that?”\nShe could Perceive Jio Somu’s jade aura glowing with\nsmug scorn. He saw her as a spoiled princess, twenty-three\nyears old, playing at being a Fist and getting away with it\nbecause of her father’s indulgence. It was hardly the first time\nJaya had encountered this reaction—indeed, today she was\ncounting on it—but it never ceased to gall her. “You certainly\nare confident, aren’t you?” Jio said. “To come all the way to\nLukang in person to suggest I betray my oldest ally on the\nword of a pretty girl.”\nJaya kept her smile in place but averted her eyes. “That’s\nkind of you to say, but I’m actually quite nervous, to be given\nso much trust by my father that he’d ask me to make such an\nimportant alliance.” She fiddled with one of her jade earrings.\n“Do you really think I’m pretty, though?”\nJio chuckled and moved closer to her on the seat. “I’m not\nblind.

Why did your father really send you to Lukang?” When\nJaya gave him a confused look, he lowered his voice and\nwhispered, “I know how these games are played. You’re one\nof the best cards in your father’s deck, aren’t you? One that\nhe’s been keeping in reserve for some time.”\nJaya was well aware of the suitors and families who’d\napproached her father, as if she were a prize for him to grant.\nShe was selfishly relieved that Niko’s return meant she had to\nput up with less bullshit clan speculation about her own\npersonal life. Nevertheless, she wasn’t surprised that even Jio\nSomu, a man known for being extremely cautious, responded\npresumptively to even the tiniest encouragement. Underneath\nthe table, Jio’s knee touched hers and stayed there. “It’s\nLukang’s seats in the Royal Council, isn’t it? Kaul Hilo\ndoesn’t want them going to the Mountain.”\nJaya took a chance by reaching over and placing a hand on\nJio’s knee, the one pressing against her own. She lowered her\nown voice and her gaze. “My father could’ve sent a platoon of\nFists to lay down an ultimatum, but he didn’t. He sent me, his\nonly daughter, to speak with you so that you would take his\nproposal seriously, and so that you’d see we want this to be a\nfriendly conversation, not a threatening one.”\n“That’s surprisingly politically savvy of Kaul Hiloshudon,”\nJio said. “Your father’s not known for subtlety. Perhaps he’s\ngained some wisdom over the years.”\n“I’m told that’s what happens sometimes,” Jaya said. “So\nare you wise enough, Jio-jen, to take this offer my family is\nextending? What should I tell my father?”\nJio ran his tongue over his bottom lip. His eyes traveled\nslowly over her face and body. “I would need more\ninformation to decide how worthwhile a change in allegiance\nwould be.” He glanced at the two other No Peak Green Bones,\nwho were watching him carefully. “You could come to dinner\nwith me tonight. Send your bodyguards away so that we can\ndiscuss the potential alliance in more … depth.” He placed his\nhand on top of hers under the table.\nJaya drew back her hand and her head, her lips parting in a\nsmall intake of breath. “Jio-jen,” she exclaimed with feigned\ndisbelief. “Are you suggesting … you might betray the\nMountain clan and side with my family if you could fuck me?”\n“Of course not,” said Jio. “It would have to be a lot more\nthan one fuck.”\nJaya stood. “I came here to discuss a serious alliance.\nYou’re insinuating that I’m a whore, and that my father would\nexpect me to seduce you for political gain.”\n“I can’t see what else No Peak has to offer,” Jio said with a\nsmirk.\nJaya’s eyes flashed fire.

Jio Somusen, Pillar of\nSix Hands Unity, I offer you a clean blade.”\nJio’s mouth fell open. Then he laughed uproariously. His\nbodyguards bit their lips and fought not to join in. They didn’t\neven notice that Jaya’s coy manner and her show of ire were\nboth gone. She stood expressionless as she waited.\nJio stopped, dabbing tears of mirth from the corners of his\neyes with a napkin. “Go home, princess.” He waved her\ntoward the door of the club. “I would’ve shown you a good\ntime, you know. I wouldn’t have turned to No Peak, but it was\nentertaining to see you try to win me over, especially when\nyou’re so naive. Go back to your father and tell him that he’ll\nhave to do better than that.”\n“So you refuse my clean blade?” Jaya asked.\nJio shook his head, grinning. “You really are something.\nNo self-respecting man in the world will duel a girl. Let me\ngive you some advice. If you want to be of worth to your clan,\nstop playing at being a Fist and use the assets you do have.”\n“I didn’t ask for your advice,” Jaya replied. “No man has\nagreed to duel me yet, but that doesn’t mean I’ll stop offering\na clean blade when I’ve been insulted. And now I’ll have to\ndisappoint my father by telling him that you refuse our\nfriendship.”\n“Do that,” Jio said. “Tell him I look forward to finally\nseeing Ayt Mada crush No Peak like a snail.”\n“Let’s go,” Jaya called to her Fists. The three of them\ndeparted the Big Triple to the snickers of the Six Hands Unity\nmen. One of Jio’s bodyguards followed them and opened the\nfront doors, waving Jaya through with exaggerated\ncourteousness. She could hear their laughter as the doors\nclosed behind them.\nJaya flipped open her phone and hit the speed dial. “Now,”\nshe said to Tenn.\nIn seconds, three Brock Compasses full of the Little\nKnives roared in from different directions and surrounded the\nbuilding. Young No Peak Green Bones piled out of the\nvehicles with Fullerton machine guns and blew the windows\nof the club apart with bursts of automatic fire. Roaring with\nStrength, Tenn hurled two incendiary hand grenades. The old\nwooden structure went up in crimson flames.\nFrom across the street, Jaya could feel the intense heat\nattacking her skin. She Steeled herself and wrapped a\nhandkerchief over her nose and mouth as she stood near\nenough to Perceive the pain and terror of the men inside. Some\nof them never made it out of the building, but Jio Somu and\ntwo of his bodyguards were strong enough in jade ability to\nescape the inferno. Deflecting their way through the fire and\nSteeling against burns, they managed to plunge out of one of\nthe broken windows in a blur of Strength and Lightness, their\nhair and clothes alight, screaming like elemental ghosts.

The Pillar of Six Hands Unity,\nwho’d held Lukang for twenty years, collapsed on the\nsidewalk in a mangled mess.\nJaya spat on the ground. “How’s that for using my assets?”\nShe had to thank Jio Somu. If he hadn’t felt so secure after\nsurviving so many previous attempts on his life, then he might\nnot have underestimated her. When Jaya had become a Fist,\nher father had advised her, “In my experience, as long as your\nfriends have a high opinion of you, it doesn’t hurt when your\nenemies have a low opinion, the lower the better.”\nNoyu Kain phoned the fire department and the police. By\nthe time they arrived, the Little Knives had put out most of the\nfire already. Asha and two others had opened up the nearest\nfire hydrant and several Green Bones were Deflecting the\nspray toward the flames. The buildings next door suffered\ndamage but there had been no one inside. While Jaya was in\nthe Big Triple speaking to Jio, phone calls had been placed to\nthe neighboring businesses to quietly clear out everyone on the\nblock.\nLater, it would be determined that there was one civilian\ncasualty—the kitchen manager of the Big Triple, a friend of\nJio’s cousin, had not left with everyone else and had been\ncaught in the fire and killed. It was unfortunate, but Jaya could\nexplain to everyone that she’d observed aisho to the greatest\nextent that could be reasonably expected. She didn’t feel any\nguilt over the death of one bystander who didn’t know what\nwas good for him.\nNews trucks arrived minutes after the emergency services.\nJaya checked herself in the Brock’s side mirror. Ash dusted her\nface, but her makeup was holding up remarkably well and she\nmade a mental note to get more of this brand of waterproof\neyeliner. She buckled her moon blade onto her waist. “How do\nI look?” she asked Eiten Asha. Her friend pursed her lips\ncritically, made a small adjustment to straighten Jaya’s jade-\nencrusted torque necklace, and gave her an enthusiastic\nthumbs-up.\n“I take full responsibility for what happened here,” Jaya\nsolemnly told the cameramen who surrounded her. “My father\nsent me to Lukang to discuss improving the relationship with\nthe Six Hands Unity clan. No Peak has opposed Jio Somu for\ntwenty years, ever since he betrayed his uncle, the rightful\nPillar of the clan, and my aunt was nearly killed in the\ncrossfire. But we were prepared to finally turn over a new leaf\nin this city.”\nJaya glanced back regretfully at the burned-out shell of the\nBig Triple. “Instead, Jio Somu made threatening sexual\nadvances toward me.

To offend a family like the Kauls and neither apologize\nnor settle the matter with a clean-bladed duel left no choice but\nunavoidable retribution.\n“To the rest of the Six Hands Unity clan,” Jaya said, “No\nPeak seeks no quarrel with you.

The element of\nsurprise was why they were relying on Jaya’s Little Knives.\nAny large movement of No Peak warriors from Janloon down\nto Lukang would’ve alerted the Mountain, who in turn\nwould’ve warned Six Hands Unity. But the Mountain would\nnot be paying any attention to Toshon. Jaya’s father had said,\n“Ayt Mada and Aben Soro can send all the Green Bones they\nwant. We don’t need to take Lukang. We only have to confuse\nthe shit out of the situation down there.”\nJio Somu had children, but both of them were too young to\nsucceed him. His Horn might assume leadership, but he was\nnot popular within the clan. Most of the other members of the\nJio family who’d been loyal to the old Pillar had joined the No\nPeak clan already, and with Jio’s death, there would likely be\nmore defections. Some segment of Six Hands Unity would\nremain faithful to the Mountain, but they would require\nincreased support from Janloon. Lukang would become a\npatchwork quilt of confused loyalties, and no one clan would\ncommand unified allegiance of the city’s Royal Council\nrepresentatives.\nNo Peak did not need to control all of Lukang. Over the\nyears, that goal had proved difficult if not impossible. It only\nneeded to finally kill the longtime Ayt loyalist Jio Somu and\nremove Six Hands Unity as an entity that the Mountain could\ncount on for political and military support. That was what Jaya\nhad accomplished.\nJaya said humbly into the cameras, “I’m only a Fist, so I\ncan’t speak on larger matters. I only hope that Ayt Mada\nallows the rest of Six Hands Unity to make their own\ndecisions. Nevertheless, we all know how senselessly violent\nthe Pillar of the Mountain has been in the past. I’m sure my\nfather will send additional Green Bones from Janloon to make\nsure there are no further attempts on my life or honor.”"

I’m sure my\nfather will send additional Green Bones from Janloon to make\nsure there are no further attempts on my life or honor.”\nA few reporters began to shout additional questions: Why\nhad she brought warriors, machine guns, and grenades for a\nsupposedly peaceful discussion? Did she have anything to say\nabout the reputation of the Little Knives? Was she\nromantically involved with anyone at this time? Jaya waved\naway the questions without answering any more of them and\nwalked back toward the Brock Compass. While she’d been\ntalking to the reporters, her people had efficiently stripped Jio\nof his jade, then picked through the smoking remains of the\nbuilding to claim the green from the charred corpses. They\nlooked like coal mine workers now, all grimy, covered in dust\nand soot.\n“Don’t you still look nice,” Asha exclaimed, sticking her\ntongue out at Jaya.\nKain offered up Jio Somu’s jade-hilted talon knife, his\nrings, bracelets, and the studs that had been in his ears. “Jade\nfor the biggest of the Little Knives,” he said.\n“I didn’t kill Jio,” Jaya reminded him. “I only set him up\nso that he practically killed himself. Even though I led the\nmission, it’s not right that I claim so much of the prize.” Jaya\ntook the talon knife, which was of excellent quality, but told\nKain and Tenn to see to it that the rings, bracelets, studs, and\nremaining jade from all the bodies of the Six Hands Unity men\nwere equitably split between the rest of the team.\nAs they drove back to the motel, Jaya tried to call Janloon,\nbut couldn’t get any cell phone reception. She finally managed\nto get two bars on the screen by standing in front of the lobby\nwhile the rest of the Little Knives put away weapons, set up\nsentries, and went for a beer run to the nearest convenience\nstore. She called the number that went straight to the Pillar’s\nstudy. Her father picked up on the first ring.\nJaya said, “Hi, Da, did you see me on television?”\n“I swear to the gods,” Hilo shouted at her, “you’re trying\nto kill me from stress. Why didn’t you phone right away? The\nfirst thing I saw on the news was the building on fire, without\nany other information. I called twice and you didn’t pick up.”\n“I was busy, Da! My phone was on silent. We had to talk\nto reporters, put out the fire, tromp around in a building about\nto fall down to collect all the jade and split it up, and that\nalways takes time, deciding who gets what so no one leaves\nunhappy, all those little things. You know how it is! Just trust\nme a little, why don’t you?”\nHilo let out a breath of relieved laughter. “You’re right, I\ndo know how it is.”\n“How did I look on TV?” Jaya pressed. “Okay?”\n“You looked great,” her father said. “No wild parties\ntonight, understand? Jio might be dead, but he’ll have friends\nwho will take some time to get rid of. Don’t let down your\nguard or get on anyone else’s bad side in that city. The Juen"

The Juen\ntwins will be there soon with more people, and you and your\nLittle Knives are to obey your seniors. I know you’re used to\nhaving the run of Toshon, but this isn’t Toshon.”\n“I’m a senior Fist now, you don’t have to remind me of\nevery little thing, or lecture me about how to keep people in\nline,” Jaya groaned, rummaging hungrily in the cooler as she\nheld the phone against her ear with one shoulder. “Anything\nelse?”\n“Only that I’m proud of you.”\nJaya grinned with pleasure.\nCHAPTER\n56\nLife and Death\nA\nnden looked around with great curiosity when the plane\nlanded in Tialuhiya. He’d never been to the Uwiwa Islands. In\nhis imagining, it was a sun-bleached tropical island full of\npalm trees and dirty, desperately poor people, a haven for\nillegal drugs and smuggled jade. So he was surprised that the\nnew airport was modern and airconditioned, and the\nprofessional driver who picked him up in a black town car\nspoke passable Kekonese. As they drove through the main\ntown of Walai, Anden saw evidence of ruin and reconstruction\neverywhere—crumbling and abandoned buildings covered in\ngraffiti, building cranes over high-rise projects, policemen\ndirecting traffic around road closures, a military truck flying\nan Espenian flag.\nTyphoon Kitt, which had caused considerable damage in\nKekon four years ago, had laid waste to the Uwiwa Islands,\nkilling two hundred thousand people and destroying the\ncountry’s neglected infrastructure. The Republic of Espenia,\nwhich controlled the tiny island of Iwansa for their own\nmilitary and recreational use, had provided humanitarian aid\nand sent their military to help in the extensive rebuilding\nefforts. Of course, the Espenians did not do anything without\nexacting a price. In this case, it was a price that benefited\nKekon as well. The Uwiwan government had been forced to\nclean house. A new Espenian-approved president and new\nhead of national security had fired hundreds of state and law\nenforcement officials on charges of corruption. Jade\nsmuggling, the drug trade, sex tourism, and political graft were\nall being rooted out in favor of luring foreign companies to\nbuild electronics manufacturing facilities.\nTravel restrictions between Kekon and the Uwiwa Islands\nhad been partially lifted. Technically, Green Bones were still\nbanned, but Anden had been able to enter because he was a\ndoctor, officially visiting for humanitarian purposes. It was far\nfrom the first time his unique situation and his credentials\noutside the clan had proven useful to No Peak in some\nunexpected way.\nAnden felt he was at a crossroads. He was unsure what his\nfuture held even if No Peak was able to survive Ayt’s\nmachinations. He’d done all he could to promote jade\nmedicine and the clan’s interests in Espenia; that work was\nbeing continued by others now. He was lending his experience\nto the Weather Man’s office as schools of the jade disciplines\nbegan to open up overseas, but Terun Bin would soon have"

He was lending his experience\nto the Weather Man’s office as schools of the jade disciplines\nbegan to open up overseas, but Terun Bin would soon have\nthat process well in hand. Of course, he could continue to\nwork as a physician, but he was troubled by a feeling that that\nwas not enough.\nSometimes he thought of how Lott Jin had determinedly\nclimbed straight through the ranks of No Peak step by step into\nclan leadership. Anden’s own path had been filled with twists\nand detours. Now both men frequently sat at the same dining\ntable in the Kaul house, discussing clan affairs late into the\nnight with the Pillar and the rest of his inner circle.\nDespite their regular interactions and respect for each\nother’s abilities, Anden couldn’t say if he and Lott were\nfriends. It seemed a faint yet inescapable discomfort persisted\nbetween them, an inexplicable resentment from having known\neach other as confused teenagers. Years ago, at Juen’s\nretirement party, when Anden had congratulated Lott on being\nnamed the new Horn, his old classmate had replied, “Maybe I\nshould be the one congratulating you, Emery, for avoiding the\njob, so I could be the one to take it.” His sulky mouth had\ncurved in a good-natured but sardonic smile. “I suppose\nneither of us is who we once thought we’d be.”\nAnden had given the other man a searching look. “Was it\nworth it?” he asked. “Giving up whatever else you might’ve\nbeen, to take the path you didn’t think you would?”\nLott had shrugged. “Who can ever know? Was it worth it\nfor you?”\nWhen Anden had mentioned his recent musings about the\nfuture to Jirhuya, his boyfriend had listened and said, with\nsympathy, “I think it’s natural in our forties to start wondering\nif we’re past the main events of our lives, or if there are still\nother mountains to climb. Your position in the clan is an\nincredible accomplishment in itself, miyan. Maybe you’re\nwondering what else you could do with it.”\nJirhu was no doubt speaking from his own heart; his\naccelerating career in the Kekonese film industry wasn’t the\nonly thing on his mind these days. Typhoon Kitt had damaged\nimpoverished Abukei villages far more severely than the rest\nof Kekon. Jirhu had become increasingly involved in\nadvocating for aboriginal communities and was now taking\npart in the ongoing protest on Euman Island, sometimes\nstaying out for days at a time.\nAnden worried for Jirhu’s safety, but he was hardly in a\nposition to demand he stay away from possible violence when,\nas his boyfriend pointed out firmly, “If I can put up with even\nhalf of what you do for the clan, you can accept me doing\nsomething important for my own people.”\nThe town car took Anden beyond the city limits of Walai\nproper, onto a wide, freshly paved road reeking of asphalt\nfumes in the summer heat. Anden saw the tall barbed-wire\nwalls and blocky watchtowers of the maximum-security\npenitentiary long before they arrived.

At the security fence,\nAnden presented his paperwork to the sentry in the box, and\nthen again at the office, where he was issued a visitor badge.\nAfter additional check-in procedures and thirty minutes of\nwaiting in a small, yellow reception area, a guard escorted him\ninto a room with a metal table and two chairs.\nAnden sat down in one of the chairs. A door on the other\nside of the room opened and another guard brought the\nprisoner into the room, handcuffed and dressed in a gray\njumpsuit. Anden had never met the man in person before, but\nlooking at him, it was hard to believe he’d once been a\nformidable enemy of the Kaul family. Iyilo had been the right\nhand of the notorious jade smuggler Zapunyo, before he’d\nbetrayed his boss, struck an alliance with the Mountain clan,\nand taken over the Ti Pasuiga crime ring. Now the barukan\ngangster was fat and middle-aged, his hair long and thinning\naway from his shiny forehead. All of his jade had been taken\nfrom him upon his arrest six months ago.\nIyilo sank ponderously into the seat opposite from Anden\nand squinted at him with disdain. “Who the fuck are you and\nwhat do you want?” he asked in accented Espenian.\nAnden answered in Kekonese. “I’m Emery Anden from\nthe No Peak clan.”\nIyilo sat forward slowly. “You’re one of the Kauls. The\nmixedblood cousin.”\n“You knew me for a short while as the journalist Ray\nCaido.”\nThe smuggler thought about this, then barked out a gruff\nlaugh. “So I have you to thank for killing Zapunyo all those\nyears ago. Or maybe you should thank me for helping your\nfamily to get its revenge.” He rested his hands on his belly.\n“That’s one thing I can say I have over Zapunyo. I went down,\nbut none of my enemies took me out.”\nIyilo had run Ti Pasuiga well enough at first. He had come\nfrom the Matyos gang in Shotar, and he’d learned from\nZapunyo, so he did not lack for any ruthlessness. His\npartnership with Ayt Mada had allowed him to continue to\ndominate the lucrative black market jade triangle between\nKekon, the Uwiwa Islands, and the Orius continent.\nUnfortunately for Iyilo, he lacked Zapunyo’s skills in\nmanagement. As a Keko-Shotarian foreigner, he held the\nUwiwans in contempt. He viciously punished betrayals but did\nnot spend money to cultivate loyalty by building village\nschools and hospitals as Zapunyo used to do. Over time, he\nfailed to keep up relationships and pay off the right people, so\nhe lost the iron control over the politicians and police that\nZapunyo had wielded. In the years after Typhoon Kitt, when\nthe Espenians demanded evidence from the Uwiwan\ngovernment that they were taking steps to combat crime and\ncorruption, the axe had finally fallen on Ti Pasuiga.\nEven so, Iyilo could hardly be blamed for believing\nhimself safe.

He wore jade and lived in a fortified compound\ndefended by dozens of guards who also wore jade. The\nunderstaffed, undertrained federal police force could not hope\nto go up against him. Instead, the Uwiwan government hired\nGSI to do the job.\nA squad of well-equipped, jade-wearing private soldiers\nmonitored Iyilo’s habits for weeks, then ambushed him on the\nway to a sporting event. They killed four of his bodyguards\nbut took Iyilo alive, in accordance with the terms of their\ncontract. The Uwiwan government made a victorious\nannouncement and showed news footage of Iyilo in handcuffs,\nwith credit for his arrest given to the national chief of security.\nNeither the Mountain clan nor the Matyos gang had made\na noise of protest or come to Iyilo’s aid. With the dissolution\nof the nekolva program and the decline in Slow War tensions,\nalong with the decriminalization of jade in the ROE, jade\nsmuggling was not a growing business. Ti Pasuiga was past its\nusefulness, no longer of vital importance to its old allies.\n“Did Kaul Hilo send you to gloat?” Iyilo asked Anden.\n“Seems like something he would want to do in person, the\narrogant bastard. I met him once, you know.”\n“The Pillar sent me, yes,” Anden said. “To offer you our\nhelp.”\n“Your help,” Iyilo repeated with manifest contempt. “Kaul\nHiloshudon tortured my cousin Soradiyo and slit his throat. I’d\nsooner shake hands with the devil.”\nAnden took off his glasses and wiped the dust from them,\nreminding himself that he was here for a purpose and ought\nnot to be provoked by this man who was so low and helpless\nbut still potentially useful. “Soradiyo tried to assassinate the\nPillar with a car bomb but killed his brother-in-law instead.\nEven Ayt Mada wasn’t going to protect him after that. Just as\nshe’s not protecting you now. You’re hardly in a position to be\nchoosy about the help that comes your way.”\nThe smuggler’s upper lip curled. “Yes,” he said bitterly,\n“all of you Green Bones are the same in the end, aren’t you?\nYou protect yourselves, and you use the rest of us.”\n“Has your lawyer explained that you’ll be sent to Kekon?”\nIyilo shrugged fatalistically. “Kekon is only a name to me.\nI was a baby when my family was shipped to Shotar as\nlaborers during the Many Nations War. Kekon is only the\nwrapping around my life—where I was born and where I’ll\ndie.”\nAnden felt a scrap of pity for the man. Iyilo had become\nthe center of a three-way legal tug-of-war between the Uwiwa\nIslands, Kekon, and Shotar. Both Kekon and Shotar wanted\nthe barukan leader extradited to face trial for crimes\ncommitted in their own nations.

He was not a citizen of Shotar\neither, as he could not claim at least seventy-five percent\nShotarian ancestry. His official nationality was Kekonese,\neven though he’d only lived there for a year of his life. Now,\nhowever, the Kekonese government wanted to make a public\nexample of Iyilo, to march him off the plane in handcuffs,\ndemonstrating the disgraceful end of Ti Pasuiga and all those\nwho dared to steal jade. The Royal Council had made the\nextradition of Iyilo a prerequisite for the lifting of the embargo\nand normalization of relations between Kekon and the UI, and\nafter much hassling, the Uwiwan government had agreed.\nAnden said, “You’ll likely be dead within hours of setting\nfoot in the country.”\nIyilo did not answer, but his dulled expression showed that\nhe understood reality perfectly well. The former leader of Ti\nPasuiga was a loose end for Ayt Mada. There’s no sort of\nperson the Kekonese hold in lower regard than a jade thief.\nAny number of fellow inmates or prison guards would be\nmore than happy to do the Mountain a favor and ensure Iyilo\nnever spoke in front of a judge.\n“What do you want?” Iyilo’s anger sounded weary.\nAnden glanced at the guards by the door. They were out of\nearshot and almost certainly could not understand Kekonese,\nbut nevertheless Anden lowered his voice. “You still have a\ncard to play. You know too much damaging information about\nthe Mountain: the deals Ayt struck with Zapunyo, her alliance\nwith you and the Matyos, her profit from the black market. It’s\nwhy she’s sure to have you killed.”\nAnden took a cell phone out of his briefcase and placed it\non the table. “There’s a private aircraft waiting in Janloon,\nready to bring KNB news anchor Toh Kita over here to\nTialuhiya. All I have to do is make a phone call to get you a\nnational interview.”\nIyilo’s smile was slow and very cold. “Do you know what\nI hate more than anything else in the world? Rats. When\nZapunyo and I found rats in Ti Pasuiga, we made sure they\nbegged for death. I’ll take my secrets to the grave.”\n“You’re in a prison while Ayt Mada sits in her mansion in\nJanloon.”\n“As does your cousin Kaul Hilo. What do I have to gain\nfrom being a pawn of No Peak instead of the Mountain? I’m\nnot stupid enough to think it’ll save me.”\nAnden was not a Fist accustomed to inspiring fear, but he\nknew his family’s fate might hinge on his ability to do so at\nthis moment. At other times in the past, he’d been the one to\nspeak or act for the clan when no one else could. In his youth,\nAnden had felt acutely his difference, his separateness from\nthe rest of the Kaul family. Only over many years had he come\nto understand this as an advantage.

Since he held no official\nrole in the strict hierarchy of the clan, he’d been many things\n—a healer, a killer, an emissary, an advisor. Today, he was a\nhammer.\n“You’re beyond saving,” Anden agreed. “But what about\nyour family? The one that you’ve gone to such great lengths to\nkeep secret?”\nHe reached back into his briefcase and pulled out an\nenvelope. He opened it and laid three color photographs on the\ntable in front of Iyilo. In the first photo, a pretty, thirty-\nsomething Uwiwan woman sat on a beach. She wore a pastel\nsundress, her long hair pulled into a messy bun. Her face was\nturned to the side, speaking to another woman while two\nchildren, perhaps ten and eight years old, played in the sand\nnearby. The second photo showed the same woman and\nchildren getting out of a car. In the third photo they were in the\nfront yard of a nice house.\nIyilo’s darkly tanned face lost much of its color.\n“I’m sure you’ve made private arrangements for your wife\nand children to be cared for after your death, but how can you\nprotect them after you’re gone? How can you be sure that the\nmen in Ti Pasuiga that you hired to guard them will have any\nreason to remain loyal to your memory? The Uwiwa Islands is\na dangerous place.”\n“How did …” Iyilo croaked without finishing.\n“It doesn’t matter how we found them,” Anden said\ncalmly. “If we could do it, others can. You’re not a Green\nBone of Kekon, so you can’t count on aisho to protect your\njadeless relatives. You’re only a barukan smuggler, and your\nfamily is only Uwiwan. Who is going to notice or care if\nsomething happens to them? Can Ayt Mada be absolutely\ncertain you haven’t told your wife anything inconvenient that\nshe might share with Uwiwan authorities?”\nA subtle tremor went through Iyilo’s body and rattled his\nshackles against the metal table.\n“Here is my Pillar’s offer.” Anden reached back into his\nbriefcase and took out another envelope. He extracted three\nairplane tickets and spread them out next to the photos. “We\ncan put your family on this flight which leaves tomorrow for\nPort Massy. They would be escorted to the airport under\nguard, and once they reach Espenia, they’ll be under the\nprotection of the No Peak clan. We have many people and\nresources in that country. We can set them up with housing and\nnew identities. Your children would live safe, ordinary lives.\nThey would go to school there. Maybe they could even train in\nthe jade disciplines. They’ll have the money you leave for\nthem. And most importantly, they’ll have a future far from the\nsort of life you’ve led.”\nHe could sense the man’s will crumbling, but Iyilo still\nneeded that final, gentle push toward the inevitable decision.\nAnden gathered the plane tickets and placed them back into\nthe briefcase. He saw the smuggler’s eyes twitch as the papers\ndisappeared out of sight, leaving the vulnerable photographs\nalone on the table."

You can’t put them\nin danger.”\n“You’d be surprised by the things I’ve done,” Anden told\nhim. “I’ve taken lives and saved others. I’ve felt equal doubts\nabout both.” He’d killed Gont Asch and saved Ayt Mada. He’d\nordered the death of Jon Remi, and in so doing he’d cost Maik\nTar his life. He’d healed innumerable strangers, yet he was\nhaunted every day by Ru’s death and the possibility that if\nhe’d been there, he could’ve saved his nephew. All those\ndoubts had over time folded themselves into Anden’s duality\n—of being a Kaul and not a Kaul. It was a contradiction he’d\nlong ago struggled to reconcile but that now simply was.\n“In my family, one gets used to making decisions about\nlife and death. But I know which type I prefer to make, when I\ncan,” Anden said to the condemned man. “We can’t save you,\nIyilo, but we can offer your family a life where not even the\nMountain can reach them.”\nHe picked up the cell phone. “I told the Pillar I would\nphone him right away to tell him your decision.

Mud streaked the massive luxury sedan’s\ngleaming chrome grill and white doors. Hilo rolled down the\nwindow. He’d seen images of the Euman Standoff printed in\nthe newspapers and shown on television, but they couldn’t\nconvey the restless energy or the smell. The site seemed like a\nrefugee camp crossed with an open-air music festival. Canvas\nand nylon tents were set up wherever their owners could find\nspace. The smell of cooking food came off portable gas stoves\non makeshift wooden-plank tables. A group of Abukei women\ndanced and played traditional music for a circle of onlookers.\nRows of bright yellow portable toilet stalls stood in a row\nalong one side of the camp. Dogs rested in whatever shade\nthey could find, often beneath cars draped with Kekonese flags\nand hand-painted banners. ANORCO: STEALING OUR JADE AND\nRAPING OUR LAND. ABUKEI RIGHTS! SPENNY SOLDIERS OUT.\nThe encampment had swollen to over eight thousand\nstrong, with still more arriving. The small towns on Euman\nIsland were deluged.

Hilo got out of the car along with his Horn and two other\nGreen Bones—Vin Solu, the First Fist of Janloon, and Hami\nYasu, son of the clan’s former Rainmaker.\n“Kaul-jen!

Hilo envied them. It’s been a while. A long while since\nhe’d stepped out of the Duchesse with a pack of his warriors,\nladen with jade and weaponry, prepared to face any enemy. As\na young man, he’d lived for the proud adrenaline of those\nmoments. The feeling was still sharp, but bittersweet nostalgia\ntinted its edges.\nOne figure broke out from the rest of the crowd and\napproached the Pillar directly. Jirhuya looked less well put\ntogether than he normally did. Instead of his usual custom-\nfitted shirt and pressed slacks, he was in jeans, boots, and a\nblack track jacket. He wore a colorfully woven traditional\nAbukei sash around his waist and several days’ worth of\nstubble on his jaw. He saluted Hilo respectfully. “Kaul-jen.”\nHilo said, “You’ve had dinner in my house, don’t act as if\nyou barely know me.”\nJirhu’s tawny skin flushed to a russet color. “Sorry, Hilo-\njen, it’s only that we don’t usually see each other in public and\nwithout … more of the family around.” Without Anden\naround.\nHilo put a hand on Jirhu’s shoulder and smiled to show\nthat he was not really annoyed. The man’s awkward reticence\nwas understandable, since the social division between him and\nhis partner’s family could not be helped. To be honest, Hilo\nwas surprised Anden and Jirhuya’s relationship had lasted for\nso long, although he supposed they were a good match in other\nways. “Show us what’s happening here,” Hilo said.\nJirhuya led the Pillar and his men up a gradual slope at the\nfarthest edge of the encampment. Roughly six hundred meters\naway stood a tall chain-link fence topped with razor wire,\nsurrounding a compound of three buildings and a helicopter\nlanding pad. Armed men in fatigues guarded the gates and\nwere spaced at regular intervals all around the fence, holding\nrifles and eyeing the protestors suspiciously. “GSI soldiers,”\nLott said."

Armed men in fatigues guarded the gates and\nwere spaced at regular intervals all around the fence, holding\nrifles and eyeing the protestors suspiciously. “GSI soldiers,”\nLott said.\n“Yesterday, there were ten of them. This morning that\nnumber doubled,” Jirhuya explained. “If anyone gets within a\ncouple hundred meters of the fence, they fire at our feet. We’re\npretty sure it’s because there’s a shipment coming in this\nafternoon.”\nSeveral people who’d followed behind the Green Bones\nmuttered angrily and spat on the ground. Anorco’s specialized\nmining vessels collected jade off the seafloor, then sorted the\ngems on board before transporting them by helicopter to the\nprocessing center where they were packed for distribution.\nOne of those final destinations was less than two kilometers\naway. Shielding his eyes with his hand, Hilo could make out\nthe outline of Euman Naval Base in the distance, its flags\nflapping in the stiff wind.\nOver the course of the standoff, protestors had thrown\nbricks, paint, and cheap homemade explosives onto Anorco’s\nproperty, hurled verbal abuse at the guards, and tried to disrupt\ndeliveries of jade into and out of the facility. The company had\nresponded by increasing security, so GSI soldiers now stood\nwatch day and night.\nThe occasionally violent demonstrations were not openly\ncondoned by either the Kekonese government or the Green\nBone clans, but they weren’t being reined in either. Several\nmembers of the Royal Council had expressed sympathy and\nsolidarity with the protestors, and more than a few Green\nBones from multiple clans had joined in the demonstration\nwith the tacit permission of their Pillars. Kaul Hiloshudon\nshowing up on Euman Island in person, however—that was\nnew. It was the most dramatic sign of clan support for the\nstandoff to date. A wave of shifting, murmuring, restless\nenergy was sweeping over the crowd. Thousands of people\nwere gathering on the ridge where Hilo and his men stood.\nNews reporters emerged from trucks along the camp’s\nsidelines, cameras ready, eagerly waiting for something to\nhappen.\n“What can you tell us, Vin?” Hilo asked.\n“Some of those GSI mercenaries are definitely wearing\njade, but I’d need to get closer to tell you more, Hilo-jen.” The\nFirst Fist’s longrange Perception was legendary by now, but\neven Vin the Sniper couldn’t be precise at this distance.\n“Let’s get closer, then,” Hilo suggested.\nThey began to walk down the other side of the slope\ntoward the fence. Before they could get far, half a dozen Green\nBones pushed through the crowd, running up to the Pillar and\ndropping to their knees in the dirt before him. Not one of them\nappeared to be over the age of twenty-five. “Kaul-jen,” gasped\na young woman with dyed orange hair and a jade nose ring,\n“we’re all fairly worthless members of the clan—my friend\nand I are junior Fingers who used our vacation days to join the\nprotest, my other friend here is a Luckbringer, and I don’t\nknow about these other two—but we’re all ready to obey you.”\n“No Green Bone of No Peak is worthless,” Hilo said,\nsmiling at their youthful enthusiasm.\nFour additional strangers stepped forward together out of"

We’ll stand with you against the foreigners,\nif you’ll allow us. Our Pillar hasn’t ordered us to do\notherwise.”\nHilo nodded. He wasn’t surprised that Ayt Mada remained\nsilent on the Euman Standoff, since she was secretly in the\nprocess of buying Anorco outright. “Bring any weapons you\nhave,” he commanded the gathered Green Bones. “Your most\nimportant task is to protect the people here from harm.\nOtherwise, obey whatever my Horn and Fists tell you to do.\nUnderstand?” They all saluted Hilo and assured him that they\ndid.\nHilo and his warriors approached the fence surrounding\nthe Anorco facility, trailed by the additional Green Bones and\nan enormous crowd of excited people, including many driving\nslowly in vehicles, waving signs and flags. Summer rain began\nto fall. The warm, heavy drops struck uncovered heads and\nsplattered the hoods of the cars.\nVin’s stride slowed, his gaze unfocused. “There are at least\nthirtytwo people in that facility, Kaul-jen,” he said. “I can’t\nPerceive all the way to the other side of the property, so I\nmight have missed a few. I think most of them are security\npersonnel, but not all of them are wearing jade. I’ve picked out\neighteen jade auras in total.”\n“Eighteen’s not too bad,” Hilo said. “But not too good\neither, when they all have rifles and body armor and are\nalready upset.”\nAlthough his own Perception was not as superb as Vin’s\nfrom this distance, he could sense the crackling apprehension\nemanating from the GSI soldiers guarding the fence, and he\ncould see them with their R5 rifles held at the ready as the\nwave of vehicles and bodies flowed toward them.\nOne of the guards shouted at them through a bullhorn, first\nin Espenian, then in barely understandable Kekonese. “Stop!\nYou’re approaching private property. Stay where you are or we\nwill open fire. You’ve been warned!”\nLott said to the Pillar, with a hint of apprehension, “We\ndon’t have enough Green Bones with us to take out all those\nguards, much less capture the facility.”\n“We don’t need to do either of those things.” Hilo stopped\nat the point where he could Perceive the anxiety of the guards\nstarting to crest, their fingers sliding toward the triggers of\ntheir raised rifles as he came near two hundred meters of the\nfence. The Pillar turned to face the line of protestors who’d\nfollowed him like an army. He spread his arms, throwing a\nslow, shallow Deflection that rippled outward, nudging those\nin the front row with a firm but gentle pressure. They came to\na halt.\n“What do we do now, Kaul-jen?” asked Hami Yasu.\n“We wait. Shouldn’t be long.” Hilo lifted his gaze to the\nsky. The wind was picking up. It lashed his face with rain,"

The gathered\nmass of protestors milled about impatiently, talking among\nthemselves, but they didn’t venture past the point where the\nPillar stood.\nThe sound of a helicopter rose in the distance, then grew\nlouder as it approached. Right on time. The clan’s White Rats\nembedded inside GSI had been earning their keep.\nHilo motioned Lott and his Fists over and explained what\nhe wanted them to do. They nodded, none of them showing\nany surprise or uncertainty. When Hilo said, “Hami-jen, your\nfather tells me that your Lightness is excellent,” the Fist\nlooked abashed and humbly promised he would do his best.\nHilo leapt Light to the top of a nearby van, landing in a\ncrouch. When he stood and raised his arms, the large crowd\nfell silent and everyone turned toward him, pressing forward\nexpectantly.\n“Can you hear me?” Hilo bellowed. “Can you hear me?”\nAn answering tumult rose from the throng. Among the sea\nof upturned faces, Hilo saw Jirhuya, looking up at him with an\nuncertain expression but listening to every word along with the\nothers.\n“No matter which part of the country you’re from, which\nclan you swear allegiance to, whether you wear jade or not, we\nare all Kekonese. We defend and avenge our own. You wrong\nany of us, you wrong us all. You seek to war with us, and we\nwill return it a hundredfold.” Hilo was not one for speeches—\nthat had always been Ayt’s strength—but the words that came\nto him now sprang to mind fully formed. He couldn’t place\nwhere they’d come from, yet they felt strong and correct. The\nPillar tilted his head back and roared even above the growing\nnoise of the arriving helicopter. “No one will take from us what\nis ours!”\nThe helicopter came out of the sky, thundering toward the\nlanding pad in the fenced compound. As the pilot slowed to a\ncontrolled hover, Hilo shouted a signal to his Fists. Gathering\nall of his jade energy like a tide sucking in the ocean, he bent\nhis knees and launched himself Light into the air.\nGravity seemed to slip its hold on him as he hurled himself\naway from the ground and the people below. Lott, Vin, and\nHami leapt Light alongside him, driving themselves upward\nby bounding off cars or springing from a Strength-fueled\nrunning start. They couldn’t reach the helicopter—it was too\nfar away and they were only men after all, not birds. But they\ncould get closer, close enough.\nAt the apex of his leap, for a dramatic heartbeat of time,\nHilo hung in the air at the height of a second-story window. He\ncould feel his momentum reversing. He needed to hold on to\nenough Lightness to control his descent or he would plummet\nto a bone-shattering landing.

The pilot’s surprise sparked in his\nPerception like a pulse of light in the corner of his brain before\nhe glimpsed the man’s face, leaning over, mouth open at the\nremarkable sight of four men leaping up as if to grab on to the\nhelicopter’s landing skids.\nHilo maintained his grip on one discipline while reaching\nfor another. His mind and body strained in painful protest as\nhe flung his arm toward the cockpit of the helicopter with a\nsnarl of exertion and a violent heaving of nearly all the\nremaining jade energy he possessed.\nFour shafts of Channeling hit the pilot almost\nsimultaneously. These were not the precise close-quarters\nstrikes that would deliver a fatal blow to the heart or lungs of a\ncombatant. From such an unwieldly distance away and in\nmidair, the force of Channeling was blunt and badly\ndissipated. Any Green Bone could’ve easily Steeled against\nthe ridiculous, unorthodox attack.\nBut the man in the helicopter was not a Green Bone. The\ncombined buffeting of jade energy from all four assailants did\nnot kill him, but the disruptive shock to his organs and nervous\nsystem knocked him unconscious. His body fell back against\nthe seat, then slumped over the controls.\nHilo landed harder than he would’ve liked. After such a\npowerful burst of Channeling, he had barely enough jade\nenergy left to let himself down Lightly and to Steel against the\nimpact. Pain radiated up his shins and thighs into his hips as he\nhit the ground and tumbled forward onto hands and knees, all\nthe breath knocked out of his lungs. Hami Yasu dropped down\nLightly next to him, breathing only slightly harder than\nnormal. “Kaul-jen, are you all right?”\nDamn the young. Hilo nodded that he was fine as he got to\nhis feet, wiping the sweat off his brow and brushing the dirt\nfrom his hands and knees. He looked up at the helicopter.\nEveryone else was staring at it transfixed as well, including the\nsecurity guards surrounding the landing site, as if watching a\ntrain crash in slow motion. The uncontrolled machine listed in\nthe air, still on course for a landing, but coming down far too\nfast now. It tilted and began to spin laterally, churning rotors\nkicking up a tremendous wind that tore at the clumps of grass\nand sent many people in the crowd running for the cover of\ntheir vehicles. Hilo heard the Finger, the young woman with\norange hair, let out a shout of astonishment and elation. “Holy\nfucking sh—”\nThe pilot regained consciousness at the last minute,\nrealized what was happening, and tried valiantly to right the\nhelicopter. He was too late. With the horrifying sound of\nrending metal, the aircraft missed the landing pad and hit the\nground barely inside the perimeter of the fence, bouncing\nsideways and back into the air off one landing skid and its tail\nrotor. Guards ran from the out-of-control machine as it spun in\na circle, hitting the top of the chain-link barrier and ripping an\nentire section of the fence apart as it careened back into the\nground with a concussive boom and explosive cloud of dirt.\nThe helicopter’s rotor blades were torn apart by the impact and\nwent flying in all directions."

For a prolonged moment, no one\nmade a sound. Then a victorious roar exploded from the\ncrowd. For months, they’d been watching the fenced\ncompound hatefully, seeing deliveries of jade enter and leave\nthe processing facility, unable to do anything besides exact\nminor sabotages and make their unhappiness known. The sight\nof the crashed helicopter—brought down by only four of No\nPeak’s top Green Bones!—seemed to light the protestors on\nfire. Like a flood wave through a broken dam, they ran\nshouting toward the wreckage and the open fence.\nGSI soldiers were also sprinting toward the helicopter, on a\ncollision course with the crowd. Other security guards ran to\ndefend the gap in the destroyed fence, rifles raised.\n“Get in front of those people before they get themselves\nkilled,” Lott shouted to the Green Bones. He was barely heard\nover the collective clamor. The Horn took off running, Vin\nright behind him. Hami, the youngest, quickly caught up and\npassed them. With their Strength, they outpaced the rest of the\ncrowd, but they couldn’t catch up with the bouncing off-road\nvehicles some people were driving toward the Anorco soldiers\nlike charging cavalry troops.\nThe orange-haired Finger and her companions reached the\nhelicopter first and tore into it triumphantly like wolves on a\ncarcass, pulling out the dead pilot and dumping him in the dirt,\nthen pooling their Strength to yank open the damaged doors,\nhauling out the cargo of sealed metal containers.\n“Get away from there!” hollered a running GSI soldier. He\nskidded to a halt, aimed, and fired his R5. The sound of bullets\nzinged off the helicopter’s metal body. A few people dove for\ncover behind the machine. Green Bones threw up Deflections.\nOne of the men from the Mountain clan hurled a powerful\nwave that knocked the soldier to the ground and sent his rifle\nflying out of his hands. Shouting curses in Espenian, other GSI\nmercenaries opened fire into the rampaging crowd.\nHami, Lott, and the other Green Bones closest to the\nsoldiers tried to Deflect the gunfire away from the civilians,\nbut Hilo saw two people—an Abukei man and a woman\nholding a placard—both go down. The man screamed and\nclutched his leg. The woman didn’t move. Green Bones drew\nhandguns and returned fire. Maddened protestors grabbed any\nweapon they had on hand—knives, sticks, rocks.

They\ncontinued running heedlessly and throwing abuse and objects\nat the soldiers, who balked and retreated toward the fence,\nresponding with rifle bursts that sailed into the crowd or struck\napproaching vehicles, puncturing tires and breaking\nwindshields.\nHilo jogged up to the scene as it turned into a pitched\nbattle. Deflections, bullets, rocks, and profanities were being\nthrown every which way. Some protestors were charging\nahead to fight; others pushed frantically in the other direction,\ntrying to flee the gunfire. It was a noisy, disordered frenzy, like\na fighting pit packed full of gamecocks. The GSI soldiers were\npanicking in the face of the enraged mob. Gunfire hit one of\nthe young No Peak Green Bones and three additional civilians.\nLott hurtled forward in a blur of Strength and Lightness; two\nthrowing knives left his hand and sank up to their hilts in the\nneck of the soldier who’d fired, right above the collar of his\nbulletproof vest. His companions dragged the body backward,\nscreaming for assistance and still firing.\nTalon knife in hand, Hilo pushed and Deflected his way\nthrough the melee. He called out to Vin and pointed back at\nthe helicopter. “Don’t let any jade from there go missing in\nthis shitstorm!” Spotting Jirhuya, rumpled and muddy, eyes\nwide with adrenaline and fear, he seized the artist by the arm\nand ordered harshly, “Don’t you fucking break my little\ncousin’s heart. Get behind something, now. That truck.”\nJirhuya gaped at the Pillar, who’d always seemed tolerant\nand friendly with him, as if seeing him for the first time. Hilo\ngave the man a shove toward safety, then continued in the\ndirection of the fighting. “Stop firing!” he demanded,\nspreading his arms. His Perception was jangling discordantly\nfrom all the frenetic energy and emotions swirling around him,\nbut he still sensed the nearby murderous intent of the GSI\nsoldier aiming for his head. With a snarl of angry impatience,\nhe shoved the man’s aim upward with a snap of Deflection and\nwas upon him in an instant, wrenching the handgun away with\na surge of Strength that unpleasantly tweaked something in his\nshoulder joint. Hilo smashed the soldier across the temple with\nthe butt of the Corta 9 mm and kicked him in the side of the\nhead as he went down into the wet dirt.\n“I said stop fucking firing!” he roared.\nHilo had come to Euman Island intending to create a\ndramatic public statement, but perhaps it had worked too well.\nHe’d underestimated the demonstrators’ pent-up frustration.\nThey’d certainly been galvanized, but many might soon be\ndead. In hindsight, Hilo wished he’d brought along more of his\nwarriors, but none could be spared given that the Juen twins\nand their teams were busy in Lukang. There weren’t enough\nGreen Bones here to fight the soldiers and protect so many\njadeless civilians.\nThe GSI soldiers were falling back to Anorco’s main\nbuilding, pulling slain or wounded comrades, still pointing\ntheir rifles into the threatening mob. “Let them go!” Hilo\nordered.

Lott and Hami followed the Pillar’s lead and did the\nsame, up and down the line as the GSI men continued backing\naway. One foreign soldier shouted frantically into a radio\nhandset, too quickly for Hilo to make out all the words in\nEspenian, although it was clear he was calling for\nreinforcements, most likely from the GSI training compound\neight kilometers away.\nHilo grinned savagely as he pointed at the man. “Call your\nboss,” the Pillar shouted in Espenian. “Call Jim Sunto and tell\nhim to come.”\nHe had no idea if the mercenary with the handset heard\nhim or if he relayed the message, but the cameramen from the\nnews trucks did. They crouched on the sidelines like war zone\ncorrespondents, creeping closer to get a better shot of Hilo and\nhis men standing in front of the crowd as the military\ncontractors retreated. The space where the fence had stood\nbecame, by unspoken agreement, a line in the battlefield that\nneither side crossed.\nVin approached, trailed by the young, orange-haired Finger\nand her friends, who staggered under the weight of the metal\ncontainers they’d confiscated from the ruins of the helicopter.\nThey dropped them at Hilo’s feet and saluted him.\n“Jade for our Pillar,” the woman exclaimed, her face\nflushed, her eyes bright with the high of battle. “Far do your\nenemies flee, Kaul-jen.”\nHilo looked past the fence. Summer rain continued to fall,\ndripping off his hair into his eyes, turning the trampled dirt\nand grass to mud. Shouting continued on both sides. Some\npeople had climbed on top of the helicopter and were waving\nKekonese flags. The Euman Standoff had turned into a siege.\n“Not yet, they haven’t,” he said. “But they will.”\nCHAPTER\n58\nA Promise Kept\nE\nighteen hours later, Jim Sunto arrived in an armored vehicle\noutside of the Tranquil Suites Hotel. The CEO of Ganlu\nSolutions International had been at his home near the\ncompany’s headquarters in Fort Jonsrock when he’d been\nwoken in the predawn hours by a phone call informing him\nthat following a violent clash on Euman Island, two of his\nemployees were dead and another three were in the hospital. A\nhelicopter pilot employed by Anorco was also dead. Nine\nKekonese civilians had been killed by gunfire and thirty others\nhad suffered injuries.\nSunto had gotten onto the earliest possible flight to Kekon.\nTwo No Peak clan Fingers intercepted him when he walked\ninto the hotel lobby. They took his sidearm and escorted him\ninto the elevator and up to the top floor, which had been\nentirely taken over by the Pillar and his men. Sunto was\nboiling over with fury when he walked into the suite.\n“What the fuck have you done, Kaul?”\nHilo was sitting on the sofa, finishing breakfast and\nwatching the news, an ice pack wrapped around his shoulder."

Additional Green\nBones of both clans had arrived on Euman Island along with\nthe army, state police, and more reporters. The protestors had\nwithdrawn to the ridge beside the original encampment while\nGSI contractors salvaged the helicopter and repaired the fence\naround the Anorco property. Lott had left a dozen No Peak\nGreen Bones at the site of the standoff and was coordinating\nwith Aben Soro in the Mountain clan to establish rotating\npatrols to maintain peace in the area. The Horn hung up the\nphone when Sunto came in. He exchanged a glance with the\nPillar, then went through a door into an adjoining hotel room.\nHilo took a final bite of a meat bun, chewing and\nswallowing as he picked up the remote control and hit mute to\nsilence the television, which was replaying dramatic images\nfrom yesterday—Hilo on top of the van, the smoking ruins of\nthe crashed Anorco helicopter, GSI soldiers firing into the\ncrowd, people being carried away on stretchers. Hilo wiped his\nmouth with a napkin and looked up at Sunto calmly. “Do you\nremember the promise I made to you, Lieutenant?”\nThe man’s aura, normally so subdued and unreadable, was\nvibrating like a tuning fork. “This is your twisted idea of\nvengeance against me? You destroyed a helicopter, killed its\npilot, and incited a violent mob to charge Anorco’s company\nproperty and attack my employees. You’re a psychopath. You\nhave the innocent blood of a dozen dead people on your\nhands.”\n“Spoken with the true hypocrisy of an Espenian,” Hilo said\nwith a slow sneer, “by a man who created a company of\nmercenaries to fight for the highest bidder in wars around the\nworld. What blood do you have on your hands, Sunto?”\nSunto bristled. “Only the unavoidable losses that any\ncommander has to accept.”\n“Unavoidable because they didn’t follow your religion? Or\nbecause the Espenian government was paying you millions of\nthalirs to carry out Operation Firebreak?”\nSunto’s jaw tightened. He didn’t ask how the Pillar knew\nabout Operation Firebreak; the answer was obvious now that\nNiko had returned to No Peak. But he wasn’t about to be put\non the defensive when it was Hilo’s actions he had come\nhalfway around the world to confront.\n“Don’t change the subject to equivocate on morals with\nme,” Sunto growled. “You’ve set off a diplomatic shitstorm\nthat will backfire on you. I’ll see to it that you’re charged for\nthe deaths of Anorco and GSI employees as well as provoking\npublic violence and destroying private property. You’ll never\ntravel to the ROE again without being arrested.”\nAt Hilo’s expression of utter nonchalance toward these\nstatements, Sunto’s voice rose and gained vehemence. “The\nfounder of Anorco, Art Wyles, is the incoming secretary of"

You might believe you’re untouchable in your\nown country, but do you think your supporters in the Kekonese\ngovernment will continue standing behind you when they\nrealize how badly you’ve jeopardized the relationship with the\nROE?”\nHilo took the ice pack off his shoulder. He stood, rolling\nout the offending joint and stretching his neck from side to\nside. “You say I’ve risked Kekon’s relationship with the ROE.\nWhat have you done to Espenia’s standing in Kekon?” The\nPillar’s voice was low and calm, a sure sign of danger. “For\nyears, your jade-wearing private military contractors have\nbeen protecting Anorco’s ships as they stripped Kekon’s\nseafloor. Yesterday, your men opened fire on civilians. They\ncould’ve defended themselves with Deflection or Steel, but\nthey used their rifles. It’s all been captured on video and\nplayed on every news channel. GSI soldiers shot first, before a\nsingle Green Bone or protestor even drew a weapon.”\nThe glower on Sunto’s face didn’t change, but the cords in\nhis neck tightened and his jade aura swelled. Hilo stalked\ntoward him, head tilted. “Espenian soldiers don’t know how to\nuse jade abilities in a crowded city street, surrounded by\nordinary people. IBJCS doesn’t teach aisho.”\nSunto seethed, “Those soldiers wouldn’t have fired if their\nlives hadn’t been threatened. No matter how you spin the story\nin the Kekonese media, the fact is that there wouldn’t have\nbeen any deaths yesterday if you hadn’t gone there to make a\nspectacle of yourself. You started this, Kaul.”\nHilo shook his head, his lips parted with scorn. “Do you\nknow much Kekonese history? Green Bones alone didn’t\ndefeat the Shotarian army in the Many Nations War. They had\nthe support of the people. In Kekon, it’s always been Green\nBones who inspire the people to fight for themselves.” Lott Jin\nwalked back into the room with a large cardboard box, which\nhe set on the coffee table in front of the sofa. Hilo walked over\nto it, speaking to Sunto over his shoulder. “No matter what\nhappens now, you and your company are done in Kekon.”\nFor all his anger and threats, Sunto had lived in the country\nlong enough to know that Hilo was correct. The importance\nthe Kekonese placed on aisho meant that the public outcry\nover foreign soldiers wearing Kekonese jade while gunning\ndown unarmed Kekonese citizens was already building into a\ntsunami in the media, in the streets, in the Royal Council.\nWen’s rapidly deployed campaign with a roster of top movie\nstars raising money for the families of the slain and injured\nprotestors was only three hours old but had already amassed\nhundreds of thousands of dien.

This is your own\npersonal grudge.”\n“Why can’t those two things be the same?” Hilo opened\nthe cardboard box and took out a videocassette. He slid it into\nthe player attached to the room’s television, then hit the button\non the remote control to unmute the set. Sunto reached the\ndoor of the hotel room, but stopped as the voice on the\nvideocassette began speaking.\n“GSI’s company people didn’t say the name ‘Operation\nFirebreak,’ but we knew that was what it was. It’s what the\nsenior guys all called it. We were ordered not to discuss any of\nour assignments. The ROE wasn’t officially supposed to be in\nany of those places. Eighty percent of the contractors were ex-\nEspenian military, though. The Kekonese recruits, we got\nspread around because we had more jade and were better at\ncertain things, like Deflection and Perception.”\nSunto turned around. The person speaking on the recording\nwas backlit and darkened so his face was not visible, and his\nvoice had been electronically altered, but Hilo knew it was\nTeije Inno. He wondered with idle curiosity if Sunto could\nrecognize the man, whether he knew his soldiers personally\nthe way a good Horn would know his Fists and Fingers,\nwhether beneath the corporate pragmatism he felt any sense of\npersonal betrayal.\nOn the screen, Teije continued to speak. “In Udain, our\nobjective was to suppress the Deliverantist rebellion. We\ntrained the Udaini government’s soldiers and secret police,\nand we helped them to track down and round up suspected\nrebel leaders. The rebels were mostly farmers, townspeople\n…” Teije’s voice trailed off. When he spoke again, it was more\nslowly and with a thickness in his voice that could be heard\neven through the electronic distortion. “This one time, we were\nsent to ambush a rebel scouting party, but the intelligence\nturned out to be wrong. The people we shot weren’t soldiers.\nTwo of them were children. And to make it all worse, we were\nwearing jade and should’ve Perceived they weren’t a threat. It\nall happened too quickly.” A long pause on the tape. “I heard\nabout another incident where—”\nSunto strode over to the television and jabbed the power\nbutton, turning off the video playback.

He spun toward Hilo\nand Lott with naked disgust. “Is that your own son, on the\nvideo? Did you write a script and force him to recite it into a\ncamera?”\nHilo’s face changed with frightening suddenness. “I ought\nto kill you where you stand,” he whispered. “No, that’s not\nNiko.”\n“So you’ve found a former GSI employee, a Kekonese\nman you could threaten or bribe to slander the company\nwithout providing any context,” Sunto inferred. “Without\nOperation Firebreak, pro-Ygutanian forces would’ve spread\nDeliverantism around the world. Yes, there were occasionally\ncivilian casualties, but they were isolated incidents, a\nnecessary cost in the fight for Truth.” Sunto reflexively\ntouched the triangular pendant around his neck, then seemed\nto remember he was around unTruthful nonbelievers and\nturned the gesture into a dismissive wave at the television. “Do\nyou think this trash journalism-style tell-all is going to give\nyou some sort of leverage over me? That it’ll be newsworthy\nanywhere outside of Kekon?”\n“Not by itself, no,” Hilo admitted, as Lott reached back\ninto the box and pulled out more videocassettes, audiotapes,\nsheafs of paper, and photographs in file folders, all of which\nhe stacked on the coffee table in an impressive pile. “All of it\ntaken together, though? It’ll be interesting to some journalists\nand politicians in Espenia, I would think.”\nSunto stared at the accumulating damning evidence. “How\ndid you—”\n“You arrogant fuck,” Hilo said quietly. “You were so\ncertain the clans were headed to the trash pile of history, as if\nwe haven’t been fighting wars ourselves this whole time, on\nevery level and around the world. When I said I’d bring you\ndown, you only ever assumed I’d have you killed.”\nSunto’s face did not betray him, but his aura did. It bulged\nand churned.\n“It’s an election year in your country, isn’t it?” Hilo asked.\n“Operation Firebreak was a trillion-thalir, decade-long\ninitiative that the Espenian government hid inside the War\nDepartment budget while supposedly pulling ROE troops out\nof foreign proxy wars. I’m sure your superiors must have\npolitical enemies who would be happy to turn this information\ninto a major scandal.” Hilo smiled, not in amusement, but in\nappreciation of Shae’s unfailingly detailed and persistent\nbriefings. “When that happens, someone will have to take the\nfall. You’ve worn an Espenian uniform, and you pray to their\nGod and Seer, but your face and blood are Kekonese. They’ll\nturn on you, Sunto.”\nSunto was quiet for an entire minute. Then he nodded. “All\nright, Kaul.” His jaw was clenched. “I see how it is. How\nmuch am I going to have to pay you?”\n“You spenny piece of shit, do you think I want your dirty\nmoney?” Hilo exclaimed with so much violence in his\nexpression that even the ex–Navy Angel took an involuntary\nstep backward.

Lott and his Fingers near the door tensed, their\nauras humming. “I’d like to see your company burned to the\nfucking ground and you thrown into an Espenian prison by the\nsame politicians who paid you so handsomely,” the Pillar\nsnarled. “Instead, I’m doing what I don’t want to do. I’m\noffering to save you, Sunto.”\nHilo pointed to the cassettes and papers on the coffee table,\nrepresenting countless hours of effort on the part of the clan’s\nWhite Rats. “I’ll lock all of this into a vault where it’ll never\nbe seen by anyone. All you have to do in exchange is work for\nNo Peak one last time.”\n“Work for you?” Sunto exclaimed in bewildered suspicion.\n“To do what?”\n“Bring down your boss,” Hilo said. “Wyles.”\n“Art Wyles?” Sunto repeated uncomprehendingly.\n“You heard me,” Hilo said. “I want Anorco destroyed.”\nSunto breathed through his teeth. “GSI is part of the\nAnorco Global Resources conglomerate. Art Wyles invested in\nmy company from the beginning. He’s the reason we landed\nthe War Department contract. I won’t turn on a friend and\nfellow Truthbearer.”\nHilo was tempted to remind the man that they had been\nfriends at one time as well. Espenian friendship, Hilo thought,\nis worth exactly what you can pay for it.\nInstead he said, “Wyles is selling his share of Anorco to a\nprivate investor. That private investor is the Mountain clan.\nUnless you find a way to extricate GSI from its parent\ncorporation, you’ll soon be answering to Ayt Madashi.” As\nSunto’s face slackened with disbelief, Hilo could not help but\nsmile at the irony that one of his detested enemies should end\nup eaten by the other. “The company you founded based on\nsupposedly modern, Truthbearing, Espenian ideals will be\nused to protect Mountain clan assets and advance Mountain\nclan interests.”\n“That’s not …” Sunto shook his head. “Art’s stepping\ndown from Anorco, but he never …” Hilo could see that the\nman wanted to accuse him of lying, but behind the stare of\nblistering animosity, confusion was spinning quickly into\ndoubt and grim understanding.\nSunto broke eye contact first. He went over to the sofa\nHilo had vacated and sat down hard. Hilo stood in front of the\nman and leaned down to peer into his face. “Wyles betrayed\nyou. He’s selling his company to protect himself. I know this\nbecause I know Ayt Madashi. You know Art Wyles. What does\nthe Mountain clan have that could bring him down?”\nSunto’s jaw worked back and forth. “Proof,” he said\nreluctantly, but with certainty. Even with Hilo watching him,\nhe touched the Dawn of Icana pendant to his lips and\nwhispered a prayer in Espenian, perhaps for strength or\nforgiveness—Hilo could not tell. “Proof of Art’s criminal\nconnections to the Crews.

Anything concrete could sink\nhis political career or land him in prison. That’s the one and\nonly thing I can think of that could make him sell Anorco.”\nBitter silence stretched between the two men as they\nstewed in hatred and grudging regard for each other and their\nmutual enemies. Hilo nodded and straightened. “The sale of\nAnorco will close in six weeks. My Weather Man tells me it\ncan’t proceed if Wyles is charged with financial crimes and his\nassets are frozen. She’s also told me that if Anorco is broken\nup, you’ll be able to regain control of GSI in a management\nbuyout.”\nHilo studied Sunto’s wretched expression as if unsure\nwhether he wanted to put a comforting hand on the man’s\nshoulder or snap his neck. “You and your mercenaries will\nnever set foot in Kekon again. You’ll never recruit another\nmember of No Peak.” He looked at the stacks of tapes on the\ntable in unspoken reminder that he could still bring GSI\ncrumbling down. “But you can save yourself and your\ncompany, if you tell me right now that you’ll do as I ask.\nYou’ll help me to bring down Anorco and the Mountain clan.”\nFrom the moment he’d met Jim Sunto, Hilo had judged\nhim to be refreshingly pragmatic, a man with no allegiance to\nanyone except himself and his foreign God. Sunto put a hand\nover his eyes for a second. When he looked up at Hilo again,\nhis futile anger had solidified into dignified resignation—the\nexpression of a captive bear coming to the realization that it\nmust debase itself to eat. “What do you want me to do?”\nLott brought over a phone and set it down on the coffee\ntable.\n“You can start,” Hilo said, “by talking to a woman named\nKelly Dauk.”\nCHAPTER\n59\nEnd of a Long Judgment\nthe twenty-sixth year, tenth month\nT\nhe driver of Shae’s Cabriola Sentry inched past rows of cars\nparked haphazardly all along the shoulder of the winding hilly\nroads of High Ground.

The woman had an entire case file on Art Wyles\nand had been trying, along with federal prosecutors, to gather\nconcrete evidence of his crimes for years. The one thing they\nneeded was for Wyles’s trusted business partner, Jim Sunto, to\nmeet with the suspect and elicit a confession while wearing a\nwire.\nSunto had confronted Wyles to demand an explanation for\nthe unexpected sale of Anorco, and thus GSI—to a Kekonese\nentity, no less. After attempts to convince Wyles to halt the\nsale, threats to tell his wife about his mistresses, and reminders\nof their joint involvement in Operation Firebreak, Sunto had\nprevailed on Wyles as a fellow Truthbearer. He’d walked out\nof the room with a recording of Wyles admitting to his past\ndealings with the Baker Street Crew but assuring Sunto that\nonce he was installed as secretary of Foreign Trade, Joren\nGasson would help them take care of the Kekonese problem.\n“Men of Truth pay their debts,” he’d promised. Art Wyles,\nShae suspected, would be paying his debt in prison for a while.\nThe Cabriola was finally forced to a stop by the thick\nthrong of people standing in front of the iron gates of the Ayt\nmansion.

Green Bones kept clan issues within the\nclan. Openly demonstrating disapproval and opposition to the\nPillar, in sight of enemies, civilians, and the media … It was\noutright rebellion. It was national news that eclipsed even the\ndeaths on Euman Island and certainly the downfall of some\npolitician in Espenia.\nA thick wall of tension stood between the Green Bones\nholding the white banner and the dozen of Ayt’s loyal Fists\nwho guarded the gates of the estate, hands resting on the hilts\nof their moon blades, watching their fellow clan members with\nwary venom. Shae could feel the animosity as tangibly as if\nshe could Perceive it. Civil war was coming.\nShe walked straight up to the most senior of the Fists in\nsight. “Tell your Pillar that the Weather Man of No Peak is\nhere to speak with her.”\nThe guard spat at Shae’s feet. “You Kauls are scheming,\nopportunistic dogs. None of you are half as green as Ayt-jen.\nShe should’ve cut off your heads years ago.”\nShae said, “If you’re truly loyal and obedient to your\nPillar, you’ll carry my message to her. Tell her I’m here on my\nown and not as an emissary of my brother.”\nStill glaring hatefully at Shae, the Fist barked an order to\none of his Fingers, who turned and hurried into the mansion.\nShae waited patiently. The crowd waited with her in the\nsweltering, late summer heat. Sweat shone on their faces.\nPeople fanned themselves and sipped water and shifted their\nweight, but still they remained. After several minutes, the\nFinger reemerged, and with great reluctance, the Fist ordered\nthat the gate be opened and Shae be allowed inside.\nShe was escorted up the paved path to the stately front\ndouble doors, into a spacious wood-floored foyer, and down a\nhall to a thick, closed door. “Wait outside,” she instructed her\nbodyguards, then pushed open the door to Ayt Madashi’s\noffice.\nShae had never before been in Ayt Mada’s presence\nwithout wearing jade. Seeing Ayt without being able to\nPerceive her unmistakably dense, powerful aura was like\nseeing a photograph of the Pillar instead of the real woman.\nAyt was standing at one of the large windows that spilled\nsunlight across her overflowing office. She was wearing tan\nslacks and a draped burgundy tank top, her arms bare as usual\nand densely encircled with jade. Even in the heat, she had a\nwhite silk scarf snugly wrapped around her neck. She did not\nturn at Shae’s entrance. From her office window, Ayt couldn’t\nsee past her front gates, but she was no doubt Perceiving all\nthe members of the clan gathered in rebellion outside the walls\nof her estate. It was a sight Shae would always remember: the\nPillar of the Mountain in profile, standing straight-backed and\nsilent in the sunlight, arms crossed, her gaze unmoving and\nslightly off-center.

A statue of an old warlord before her final\nbattle.\nA heavy apprehension gathered and settled in the pit of\nShae’s stomach. Every time she’d confronted Ayt Mada in the\npast, the consequences had been dramatic and irrevocable,\naffecting both of their clans and their lives for years afterward.\nShe’d come here counting on a pattern that seemed set by the\ngods.\n“It was cleverly done, Kaul-jen,” Ayt said at last.\nShae stepped farther into the room. “I’ve learned from a\nclever enemy.”\nTen days ago, Iyilo’s interview with KNB news anchor\nToh Kita had aired on national television. In thorough\ntestimony, the imprisoned barukan smuggler detailed over two\ndecades of Ti Pasuiga’s collaboration with the Mountain clan.\nIyilo explained that during his employment as Zapunyo’s\nclosest aide and bodyguard, he and his cousin Soradiyo had\nacted as messengers between the Uwiwan kingpin and the\nMountain’s Pillar. The conspiracy to assassinate Kaul Hilo\nwith a car bomb, which had instead killed Maik Kehn and\ninjured several civilians, had been suggested and encouraged\nby Ayt Mada in exchange for promised lenience over jade\nsmuggling.\nAfterward, Iyilo had cleverly cut his boss out of the\nconversation and conspired directly with the Mountain to take\nover Zapunyo’s business and kill his sons. With undisguised\nself-satisfaction, he told viewers that he agreed to partner with\nAyt Mada in exchange for the promise that the Oortokon\nConflict Refugee Act would be passed in the Royal Council—\nwhich it had, due to the sudden death of former Chancellor\nSon Tomarho.\nIyilo gave further detailed information about the ensuing\ntriangle of trade established between Ti Pasuiga, the Matyos,\nand the Mountain clan, to move smuggled jade and shine from\nKekon to the Uwiwa Islands to the Orius continent. Ayt Mada,\nIyilo explained, controlled the price on the black market by\nbuying back jade for her own clan and bringing it into the\ncountry covertly through Lukang, a scheme that had provoked\na civil war within the Six Hands Unity clan. She thereafter\nallowed and even helped Ti Pasuiga and the Matyos barukan\nto move jade unmolested into Ygutan and East Oortoko to\nsupply the nekolva program and other Slow War proxy\nconflicts in exchange for a cut of the profits, which she\nfunneled back into growing the Mountain’s legitimate\nbusinesses. At times during the leisurely interview, Iyilo spoke\nof Ayt Mada with admiration and cautious respect as a\nbusiness partner, at other times he expressed sneering disdain\nfor all Green Bones, and at others still, such as when he\nlamented the way Ayt had abandoned his cousin Soradiyo to\nNo Peak’s vengeance, he was openly bitter and full of\nresentment.\nWhen asked if he feared Ayt would kill him for speaking,\nthe fallen kingpin of Ti Pasuiga chuckled. “Of course she will\nkill me,” he said, with a dismissive wave at the camera."

The jade\nbusiness is the devil and Ayt Mada is its mother.”\nIyilo’s television interview had been immediately\namplified by newspaper and radio, and excerpts were being\nrebroadcast despite outrage from Ayt’s supporters, who\ninsisted the interview was fiction, a ploy by the No Peak clan\nto bring down the Mountain by bribing a condemned criminal\nto lie for their benefit.\nNevertheless, the damage that Shae and Anden had hoped\nfor was done. Iyilo’s testimony was too believable. It did not\npossess any of the rehearsed quality of a canned speech, but\ninstead had the defiant, nostalgic, rambling quality of a man\nwith nothing left to lose, taking the opportunity to get all his\nthoughts off his chest. At the request of Kekon National\nBroadcasting, two capable Green Bones of the famously\nneutral Haedo Shield clan had accompanied Toh Kita, and\nthey swore on their jade and their clan’s honor that they did\nnot Perceive any deception in the prisoner’s statements.\nIyilo’s stories validated whispered rumors that had\ncirculated for years within Mountain circles. A few days after\nthe news broke, the clan fractures became impossible to hide.\nAyt Atosho, thirty-five years old and long the successor-in-\nwaiting, remained silent, but his relatives spoke for him.\nCouncilwoman Koben Tin Bett was the first to sound the call\nfor Ayt Mada to step down as Pillar. Six highprofile Lantern\nMen defected from the Mountain clan en masse; two of them\nwent so far as to switch allegiance to No Peak. Four other\nmembers of the Royal Council declared they were ending their\naffiliation with the Mountain and were joining the ranks of\nindependent councilmen; they would not accept patronage\nfrom the clan until Ayt Mada was out of power.\nAnd now this: Ayt’s own warriors standing outside her\ngate.\n“Did you have Iyilo killed?” Shae asked.\n“No,” Ayt answered bluntly. “Perhaps it was done by\nsomeone acting out of service to the Mountain, but I didn’t\nwhisper his name. Why would I? All the damage he could do\nwas already done. I’ve told you before, Kaul Shae-jen, I don’t\nkill out of spite.” It was a remarkable admission—Ayt\nconfessing that she no longer possessed an iron grip on the\nclan, that she was losing control of the people under her.\nIyilo had been scheduled to be extradited to Kekon, but\nsecurity in Uwiwan prisons was notoriously poor. Within\nforty-eight hours of the interview being aired, Iyilo was found\ndead in his cell, his throat slit by one of the guards, who was\nhimself nowhere to be found.

If Hilo had given the order, he had not informed her.\nHe had, however, kept his word to the man, as he always did.\nOn the afternoon before his death, Iyilo had spoken for two\nhours on a long-distance phone call with his wife and children,\nall of them safely in Port Massy with new identities.\nAyt turned to face Shae at last. The past several years had\nnot been kind to the Pillar. Her spine was unbowed, but gray\nthe color of steel wool showed at the roots of her coarse, chin-\nlength dyed hair and there were deep grooves between her\nnose and lips from a lifetime of holding her mouth straight and\nsteady. The two women regarded each other across a gulf of\nlong understanding and enmity. Shae wondered if Ayt was\nnoticing her decline as well, pitying her jadelessness.\nWhen did we get old? Shae wondered. Some believed, with\nlittle scientific substantiation, that jade slowed aging, at least\nfor a while, although no one would suggest the lifestyle of a\nGreen Bone was conducive to longevity. There was even a\nsaying among Green Bones: Jade warriors are young, and\nthen they are ancient. It had been true of her grandfather, Shae\nadmitted, and it seemed true of Ayt Mada as well.\n“Would you like some tea?” Ayt asked unexpectedly. “I\nhave a fresh pot steeping.” She crossed to one of the leather\narmchairs and sat down.\n“I would like that.” Shae seated herself on the sofa across\nfrom Ayt.\nAyt took out two cups and poured for her guest first. It\noccurred to Shae that without any sense of Perception, she\nwould have no warning if Ayt decided to kill her, nor would\nshe have any chance of defending herself. Ayt could snap her\nneck as easily as pour her tea.\nShae took the proffered cup and sipped. Her hands did not\nshake. I don’t kill out of spite, Ayt had said, and she’d never, in\nall the years their clans had warred, given Shae reason to\nbelieve that was untrue. Despite all the cold-blooded things\nshe had done, all the times she’d broken aisho for her own\naims, Ayt Mada followed her own rules.\n“I’m impressed you moved so many pieces so quickly.”\nAyt poured her own tea and wrapped her long fingers around\nthe cup. “The Six Hands Unity clan is ruined, and their hold\nover Lukang broken. Whatever powerful threat or bribe you\nworked on Iyilo, it made him sing beautifully for the press.\nI’m still working out how you made Sunto into your tool after\nthat ridiculous spectacle on Euman Island, but I’m well aware\nthat Kaul Hilo has a gift for turning even his bitterest enemies\nto his own purpose.

She sipped and\nleaned back in her seat with a slow exhalation. “Any one of\nthese, I could’ve anticipated and overcome, but all together,\nthey were too destructive. I couldn’t have pulled it off better\nmyself.”\n“You give me too much credit,” Shae said. “It was a full\nfamily effort.”\nMonths ago, Shae had been the one most demoralized by\nAyt’s master plan, convinced that the Pillar of the Mountain\nhad finally solved the long riddle of how to destroy No Peak.\nThe rest of the family had simply gone to work. None of it\ncould’ve been accomplished if the clan did not have its unique\nadvantages—if Jaya was not a powerful force in Toshon with\nher Little Knives, if Anden could not travel covertly to the\nUwiwa Islands, if successive Horns of No Peak had not\nembedded White Rats everywhere the clan needed them, if the\nWeather Man’s office in Espenia had not detected the\nMountain’s scheme in the first place and connected it with the\nright lawyers and politicians, if Hilo had not already spent\nyears determined to ruin GSI.\nShae had spent decades admiring Ayt Mada as a master\nstrategist. Perhaps Ayt, for the sake of her own pride, would\nprefer to attribute her defeat to the cunning and ability of a\nyounger woman. Shae knew the truth. She was not smarter\nthan Ayt Mada; she never had been. The way to defeat a chess\nmaster was not with greater genius, but by forcing her to play\na different game.\nThe No Peak clan had grown many limbs across the\ncountry and around the world to defend itself from attacks by a\nlarger foe. It had raced to become modern and responsive in\norder to survive. If anyone had tried to win against Ayt on her\nterms, they would’ve been destroyed. But from the beginning\nHilo had surrounded himself with the people he most needed,\nand so No Peak was propelled by many strong personalities\npushing and pulling against each other but somehow together\ncarrying the clan. The family had suffered terrible strife and\nlosses that had at times torn them apart, but they were also\nbound tightly in a way that Ayt and the Kobens could never\nbe.\n“I imagine you think of yourselves as heroes.” Ayt’s voice\nwas sharp with sudden scorn. “You’ve roused the common\npeople in a show of strength, brought down the foreign\ncompanies, kicked out the mercenaries, and turned my own\nclan against me in disgrace.” The familiar fire in Ayt’s eyes\nflared and her voice was its old steel. “Yet all you’ve done is\ndelay the inevitable. There will be others—other foreign\npowers, other mercenaries, others grasping for our jade and for\nthe soul of our country.” Ayt spoke in a hiss. “The struggle\nbetween our clans will continue, for what purpose? I would’ve\nbuilt an unassailable bulwark. I would’ve put Kekon firmly in\ncontrol of its own destiny.”\n“You would’ve put yourself in control of Kekon’s destiny,”"

I would’ve put Kekon firmly in\ncontrol of its own destiny.”\n“You would’ve put yourself in control of Kekon’s destiny,”\nShae replied. “That’s not the same thing. You’re one woman,\nAyt-jen—not a god, no matter how brilliant you are, no matter\nhow much jade you wear.” She looked Ayt squarely in the face\nwithout uncertainty, without fear or doubt. “Green Bones\nweren’t meant to be gods, not until the day of the Return, and\nso long as we try, that day will never come.”\n“The gods don’t care about people or nations.” The sudden\nroughness in Ayt’s voice hinted at a depth of pain she never let\nshow. “We’re all the same to them. They don’t care who lives\nor dies, who wins or loses, who should lead and who should\nsuffer. I do.”\nShae swallowed her sympathy. “It’s over, Ayt-jen,” she\nsaid. “You’ve lost your final, masterful gamble, but most\nimportantly, you’ve lost control of your clan. Your own\nwarriors stand outside of your gates demanding that you step\naside. To remain the Pillar, you would have to slaughter all of\nthem.” A cloud passed over the sun and Ayt’s spacious office\ndimmed. Neither of the women moved. “I don’t believe you\nwill do that. Even you will not shed the blood of so many of\nyour own Green Bones.”\nQuietly, Ayt said, “Even now, you don’t know what I’m\ncapable of, Kaul-jen.”\nShae felt a shiver travel down her spine, but she replied\ncalmly. “I’m perfectly aware that you’ve always done what\nyou deem necessary, no matter how terrible. But I also believe\nyou when you say you did them not for your own satisfaction,\nbut for the good of your clan and country. What would be\ngood for them now, Ayt-jen? For you to resign willingly, to\ntransition power to your nephew—even if you judge him and\nhis family to be lacking—or to unleash bloodshed that’ll tear\nyour clan apart and set it back for years to come?”\nWhen Ayt did not answer, Shae once again wished\nintensely that she still possessed her sense of Perception. The\nPillar’s face was suddenly as unreadable as blank marble.\nShe touched her bare throat, where her jade had once\nrested. We’ve lost so much, all of us. She and Ayt Mada could\nnever escape the rivalry of their clans, but they understood\neach other, as women who were green in a man’s world.\n“Do you remember the story from history about King Eon\nII?” she asked the Pillar. “He gave up his throne in disgrace.\nHis supporters wanted him to continue to fight, but he laid\ndown his crown to spare the country from further destruction\nand suffering. Even though the people couldn’t understand or\nappreciate his sacrifice, he ensured the nation could rise in the\nfuture without him. Only he, the gods, and those in later\ngenerations whom he would never meet, would know he did\nthe right thing.\n“Do the right thing now, Ayt-jen.

Step down peacefully,\nand I promise you that I’ll prevail upon my brother to forge a\nlasting truce between the clans. We’ll renounce the blood feud\nthat’s existed between us ever since Lan died.” Speaking Lan’s\nname seemed to stir something in the room, and inside Shae’s\nchest. “No Peak will pledge friendship and brotherhood to\nyour nephew Ayt Ato. Together, we’ll lay out a plan that will\nbring the clans together, gradually and equitably.”\nThe corners of Ayt’s mouth lifted in humorless irony. “So\nnow, after years of war, when you finally hold the advantage,\nyou’d have me believe you’re in favor of bringing the clans\ntogether? Do you expect me not to see that you mean the No\nPeak clan will conquer the Mountain?”\nShae shook her head. “The time for conquest is past us.\nOur clans are too large to merge unwillingly. The younger\nGreen Bones on both sides have fought alongside each other\nagainst clanless and foreigners more often than they’ve fought\neach other, and the older ones have seen enough war. If you\npass the position of Pillar down to your nephew, Hilo and I\nwill retire within five years, and all the old grudges can finally\nleave with us.”\nAyt was silent for a long minute. She did not look at Shae\nbut instead stared out the large windows. A slight curve to her\nshoulders suggested a dragging, unseen weight. At last she\nasked, “Your Pillar will agree to this?”\n“He will.” As it had become apparent No Peak would not\nonly survive Ayt’s scheming but emerge ahead of its rivals in\nthe public eye, the conversations she’d had with Hilo on the\npatio had turned toward talk of the future, and how to secure\nthe clan’s strength. “I can’t swear on my jade anymore, but I\nwould.”\nAyt closed her eyes, then opened them again. They\nglittered from within a nest of hard wrinkles. “Many years\nago, Kaul Shae-jen, I sought you out. I wished to persuade you\nto join me, to chart a stronger course for our clans and the\ncountry. You refused. Ever since then, I have hated and\nadmired you for that choice. Surely, you see the irony of this\nmoment, as you sit here, trying to convince me to accept your\nvision instead of mine.”\n“Look at us, Ayt-jen.” Shae sighed, from deep within her\ncore. “We’re old women now. We’ve tried to kill each other\nfor so long and instead by some cruel luck we owe each other\nour lives. Maybe it’s time we stepped away and let the next\ngeneration try to do better than we did.”\nAyt finished her tea and stood. Without looking at Shae\nagain, she crossed to the window and became an outward\ngazing statue once more, but now the reddening light struck\nher differently, turning her from the still figure of a waiting\ngeneral to that of a lone survivor on the empty battlefield.\n“Perhaps you were right, Kaul-jen, on that day in the\nTemple of Divine Return.

The sun was slowly descending\nbehind the trees. She had been in the car for over an hour. One\nof her bodyguards stayed in the car with her, and the other\nstood around nearby, but they did not interrupt her thoughts.\nHer phone rang. “Hi, Ma,” Tia said when Shae picked up.\n“I know you said not to call your cell phone unless it’s really\nimportant, but your secretary said you left the office hours\nago, and Da wants to know if you’re planning to be home for\ndinner.”\nShae looked at the Mountain Green Bones still standing at\nthe gates of the Ayt mansion. Some had left and others had\narrived, but many had been there the entire time, standing\nfrom dawn to dusk and perhaps through the night as well. As\nstoic as students in a martial school training in the sun and the\nrain, hardening themselves to the physical and mental hardship\nthat went along with becoming Green Bone warriors.\n“I don’t think so, Tia-se,” Shae told her daughter. “Don’t\nwait for me.”\n“Can you take me to the mall on Sixthday?” Tia asked.\n“Maybe. Finish your homework before I get home and\nwe’ll talk about it.” Shae hung up and stared at the phone in\nher hand. Let her stay this way for as long as possible, just an\nordinary soon-to-be teenage girl, Shae prayed to no one god in\nparticular, simply offering up a wish to the universe. She knew\nit could not last forever. Tia already struggled with the cruelty\nof her mother’s world. As she grew older and understood even\nmore, it would drive her apart from the family.\nUnless, starting today, that world could be different than\nthe one Shae had known. Let it be possible. Let this be a world\nwhere I can keep her.\nSomething about the crowd changed. Shae’s bodyguards\nPerceived it and turned alertly toward the gates. Shae got out\nof the Cabriola and stood in front of the car. She could not see\nanything different at first, but then a faint ripple of backward\nmovement opened a gap in the crowd. Ayt Mada came down\nthe path from the front of her mansion, her loyal Fists and\nFingers flanking her on all sides. The great iron gates opened\nwith smooth electronic silence unbroken by any other sound.\nThe Pillar walked out among the dissidents, and even the ones\nholding the white banner condemning their leader murmured\nwarily and touched their foreheads. Even the biggest tigers\ngrow\nold, Hilo had once said. But even the oldest tiger was still\na tiger.\nAyt’s gaze did not seek out her longtime enemy standing\nacross the street, but Shae knew the Pillar of the Mountain\ncould Perceive her, waiting and watching with everyone else.\nAyt Mada adjusted the coils of jade on her arms.

She raised\nher chin and spoke in the firm, clear voice she’d become\nknown for over the years, the one that Shae had heard in\nperson and on television and that needed no amplification\nbecause it silenced those around it.\n“The Pillar is the master of the clan, the spine of the body,”\nAyt declared. “But the clan is more than the Pillar, and a body\ncannot be at war with itself. I will not justify all the actions\nI’ve taken for the ultimate benefit of my clan and my country.\nHowever, it’s clear that too much doubt has been cast on my\npast decisions for the Mountain clan to remain strong and\nunited under my leadership.\n“I hereby step down immediately as Pillar of the\nMountain. I name my nephew, Ayt Atosho, as my successor. I\ngive him my blessing. I ask all the members of the clan—\nGreen Bones and non–Green Bones alike, Fists and Fingers,\nLuckbringers and Lantern Men—to pledge their allegiance to\nhim as you’ve done for me. Under Heaven and on jade.”\nThe momentous announcement was met with powerful\nsilence. Then voices rose, reporters shouted questions, and Ayt\nMadashi turned and walked back into the house.\nCHAPTER\n60\nFinal Debts\nA\nyt Atosho’s first act as Pillar of the Mountain clan was to\nthrow the city of Janloon an enormous Autumn Festival\ncelebration. The Koben family, eager to rehabilitate the clan’s\ndamaged image, spared no effort connecting the clan’s change\nin leadership to the public’s good feelings about the popular\nholiday. Streets in Mountain districts were lined with glowing\nlanterns in alternating colors—the traditional festive autumn\nred and the pale green of the Mountain clan. Vans full of\nFingers and Wie Lon Temple students drove around town\nhanding out yellow cakes decorated with the clan’s insignia.\nAyt Ato’s handsome face was seen all over town as well as on\ntelevision talk shows and in full-page newspaper\nannouncements.\nThe No Peak clan held more subdued holiday celebrations\nin which members whispered cautious optimism and wide-\nranging speculation about the future. The clan’s oldest and\nmost formidable enemy was out of power. It seemed\nimpossible to believe. An entire generation of No Peak Green\nBones had grown up thinking of Ayt Mada and the Mountain\nclan in the same breath—as one constant, hateful threat. No\none yet knew what to think of her replacement, or what to\nexpect from the Kobens.\nHilo called the entire family and its closest friends together\nfor dinner. After a leisurely meal consisting of all the\ntraditional seasonal favorites—gingery seafood soup, thrice-\nglazed smoked pork, spicy pickled vegetables, and sticky fruit\npaste cakes—the Pillar said, “It’s a nice evening, still warm\noutside. You should all stay as long as you want.” A gentle\nsignal to those not in the inner circle of the clan’s leadership to\ntake their leave. They did so promptly, knowing the Pillar and\nhis advisors would be talking for hours to come.\nSulima helped Hilo’s mother back to her room.

Woon\nPapi, Juen Nu, Juen’s grown sons, and Maik Cam went out\ninto the courtyard with a bottle of hoji, decks of cards, and a\nrelayball. Kehn’s widow, Lina, and Juen’s wife, Imrie, took\ntheir conversation into the garden. Tia wanted to play a movie\nin the home theater. When Jirhuya offered to join her, Anden\nlooked relieved and a little surprised. Ever since the violence\non Euman Island, Jirhu had behaved more nervously around\nthe family than usual. Hilo suspected it had caused some\nfriction between him and Anden, but what did they expect? If\nthey intended to stay together, Jirhu would eventually see his\npartner’s relatives for the Green Bones they were, no matter\nhow much distance he tried to maintain from the clan.\nHilo looked around at those who remained at the dinner\ntable: Shae and Wen together on one side, Lott and Niko on\nthe other, Anden at the far end. He wrapped a hand tightly\naround the armrest of his chair, warding against the familiar\nbut undiminished pain that closed over his heart every time he\nfelt Ru’s absence. One peach cake remained on the plate in the\nmiddle of the table, and Hilo imagined, as clearly as if it were\nreally happening, his son jumping up out of his chair to claim\nit. The only other person missing was Jaya, who’d returned to\nToshon. Everyone else was gazing at him expectantly. For a\nfew seconds, he didn’t speak, overcome by a sense of poignant\npride.\nThen he said, “Ayt Atosho has asked for a meeting\nbetween our clans.”\nHe let Shae explain further. “The Mountain wants to\ndiscuss a pledge of friendship,” the Weather Man said. “They\nmade the request properly and with all the expected\nassurances, although they want it to happen soon, and\nprivately, with only the Pillar and two attendants from each\nside. We would choose the time and place.”\nNo one was entirely surprised by the news, although Lott\nnoted, “That happened quickly.” Ayt Mada had resigned only\nthree weeks ago. For her successor to so quickly reach out to\nhis aunt’s enemies might be regarded as hasty and weak,\nsignaling a lack of savvy on the part of the new Pillar. If Hilo\nwere to offer counsel to the Kobens, which he assuredly would\nnot, he would say it was a bad idea to meet with one’s enemies\nbefore being sure of one’s friends—something he doubted the\nKobens could claim with confidence.\nWen poured tea for everyone out of a fresh pot. “They\nmust feel they don’t have a choice. Stepping into the shadow\nof Ayt Mada, the Kobens have to move as quickly as possible\nto prove they’re in charge.” Many in the Mountain were still\nloyal to Ayt Mada and considered the Kobens to be a second-\nrate Green Bone family undeservedly rising to the top because\nof their size, traditionalist zeal, and media darling scion as\nopposed to any real merit."

Aben Soro and Iwe Kalundo, Ayt Mada’s Horn\nand Weather Man, had both been asked to follow their Pillar’s\nlead and resign from their positions, which they had done\nimmediately. Aben had been Horn for so long that retirement\nwas no surprise. Iwe was also an oldtimer, too closely\nconnected to Ayt Mada and too deeply embroiled in the years\nof activities that Iyilo had detailed in his interview.\nShae accepted the cup of tea her sister-in-law placed in\nfront of her and eyed the remaining cakes but resisted taking\none. “Right now, the only people Ayt Ato can trust are the\nmembers of the Koben family.” The new Pillar had named his\nsecond cousin Sando Kin as his Horn, and one of his uncles,\nan experienced but relatively unknown Lantern Man named\nKoben Opon, as Weather Man. “Everyone knows Ayt Mada\npassed the leadership onto her nephew reluctantly and doesn’t\ntruly support him, so that might leave the door open for\npotential challengers.”\n“He’s afraid we’ll take advantage of his inexperience as\nPillar and the disunity in his clan,” Lott reasoned. “We have\nthe public on our side right now, and the Kobens are afraid\nmore of the Mountain’s Lantern Men will defect to No Peak.”\nWen said, “Ayt Ato’s the pretty face of his family, but I\nthink he understands his position and is more shrewd than\nmost people give him credit for. If he’s learned from his aunt\nKoben Bett, he’ll try diplomacy before blades. He married a\nwoman in the Tem family to cement their support. Now he\nwants to secure a peace agreement with us so he has time to\nsort out his own house.”\nHilo’s mouth tilted ironically. “An alliance with the Koben\nfamily is what that old snake Yun Dorupon pushed for decades\nago.”\n“Back then, Ayt Mada was determined to annex No Peak\nand send us all to our graves,” Shae said. “Any alliance\nwould’ve been on unequal footing with the threat of\ndestruction hanging over us. The Kobens have grown in power\nsince then, but we’ve grown more. They can’t conquer us.”\nAnden nodded from the other end of the table. “We’ve\nchanged a lot as a clan. Now, maybe for the first time, we’re in\na stronger position than the Mountain. The question is whether\nfriendship with the Kobens will keep it that way.”\nHilo could feel Shae’s eyes drilling into him. She was the\none who’d gone to Ayt Mada’s mansion to convince their old\nenemy to yield. “I swore on behalf of the family that the\ngrudges would end, Hilo,” she’d told him when she returned.\n“I promised we’d begin to bring the clans together, without\nbloodshed.”\nHilo cut one of the remaining sticky cakes in half.\n“Where’s Ayt Mada now?”\n“She’s left the Ayt estate and moved into another of the\nMountain’s properties, a townhouse in the Commons,” Lott"

All of them are her\nown loyalists.” Lott paused, looking straight at the Pillar\nbefore answering the question that was truly being asked. “It\nwouldn’t be easy to get to her, but it can be done. The\ntownhouse is far less secure than the Ayt estate.”\n“Hilo,” Shae objected, “the Mountain is reaching out to\nmake peace.”\n“Ayt Mada is no longer the Pillar of the Mountain,” Hilo\nreminded her tersely. “Any peace we make with the Koben\nfamily doesn’t extend to that old bitch. As long as Ayt Mada\nbreathes, she’s a threat to us. She’ll find a way to control the\nMountain without being Pillar. We haven’t fought her for\nthirty years only to buy some act of her stepping down. She\nhas to die, sooner or later. Better sooner.”\nWen agreed, “As long as Ayt Mada lives, we can’t trust in\nany alliance with the Mountain.”\nA cheer and laughter broke out from somewhere outside.\nHilo could hear raised voices and something that sounded like\na relayball hitting the side of the house.\n“Now isn’t the time,” Shae argued. “Ayt’s been judged in\nthe court of public opinion and lost the support of her own\nclan. I agree with you that it would be just like her to try to\ncome back, to exert power from behind the scenes, but she\nwon’t be able to do that right away. She’ll let her nephew have\nhis moment in the spotlight and allow everyone to believe\nshe’s out of the picture. We should do the same. If we kill Ayt\nMada now, the new Pillar will be honor bound to respond to us\nas enemies. It’ll sabotage all chance of a lasting peace.”\n“Sparing Ayt Mada’s life has become a bad habit of yours,\nShae.”\nHis sister gave him a scathing look. “Once Ayt Ato’s\nposition as Pillar is secure and peace has been established\nbetween the clans, public attention will fade from Ayt Mada.\nThen, we can find a way to whisper her name quietly. But first,\nwe have to get to that point.”\n“The Weather Man’s made her opinion clear,” Hilo said,\ntaking half of the divided fruit paste cake and putting the other\nhalf on Wen’s plate. “What about the rest of you?”\nLott looked down, his bow-shaped mouth curved into a\npensive frown. “I’ve hated the Mountain clan for a long time,\nbut in the years I’ve been First Fist and then Horn, we’ve had\nto work alongside them as much as we have against them.\nEven if we don’t see eye to eye with the new leaders, they’re\nnot the same as Ayt Mada.

I don’t believe anyone—not\neven our foes—should be condemned because of their\nrelatives, or forced down a path they had no say in.”\nThe rest of the table was silent. Lott Jin was the only one\nin the room who was not a Kaul, but no one could deny he’d\nbeen devoted to the clan for decades, overcoming a lot of\nstruggle and doubt in his own life to become a capable Horn\nfor the past seven years. “Sometimes, it seems like violence is\na destiny that’s impossible to deny,” Lott added, “but once in a\nwhile, there are small windows of time when that can change.\nI agree with the Weather Man. With Ayt Mada gone, we\nshould set aside our feud.”\nHilo looked to Anden, who glanced at Lott with a curious\nexpression of muted admiration before taking off his glasses\nand wiping them on the hem of his shirt as he thought about\nhis reply. “The Koben family is large, but they’re nowhere\nnear as green or cunning as Ayt Mada or the people around\nthis table. They’re outspoken and capable in the moment, but\nthey aren’t clever enough to seek out new opportunities to\nreally gain advantage.” Anden put his glasses back on and said\nto the table, “I think we should agree to friendship with the\nKobens and do our best to keep them in the leadership of the\nMountain clan. That way, over time our clan will do better\nthan theirs. If and when the clans do come together, No Peak\nwill be dominant, with the Kaul family and not the Kobens\nleading the country and all Green Bones.”\nHilo smiled at his cousin’s cold and farsighted assessment.\nHe recalled that when they were young, he used to tease\nAnden for his careful and polite demeanor, trying to get him to\nlighten up. Now he could not imagine wanting Anden to be\nany other way, as it only made the green in his soul more\napparent at times like this.\n“What do you say, Niko?” Hilo asked his nephew, who had\nbeen quiet so far. “You should have a say in this decision as\nwell, since you and Jaya and your Green Bones will be living\nwith it more than us. Could you work with Ayt Ato? Would\nyou trust the Koben family’s pledge of friendship?”\nNiko looked up at his uncle. “I wouldn’t trust anyone,” he\nsaid. “But I’d still work with them. I don’t have to like or\nagree with the Koben family, but I’ve met Ayt Ato and\nwatched him over the years, and I think I understand him in\nsome ways. He needs something from us, and I agree with\nUncle Anden that it’ll be to our advantage in the long run to\ngive it to him.”\n“It’s decided, then. As Pillar, I’ve relied on all of you for\nso many years and won’t stop now.” Hilo turned to his\nWeather Man. “You’re right, Shae. The next generation\nshouldn’t be burdened by our vendettas. Tell the Mountain we\nagree to meet.” He glanced back at his nephew. “I want you at\nthis meeting, Niko. You’ll come in place of the Horn.”"

Any discussion of an alliance has to include the\ngreener side of the clan.”\nHilo said, “It’s more important that Niko be there. When I\nretire as Pillar, Niko will be the one to deal with Ayt Ato, so\nreally, this alliance will impact him more than me. He should\nbe involved in whatever agreement we come to. I’ll discuss all\nthe issues on the military side with you beforehand and bring\nthem to the meeting.”\n“Kaul-jen,” Lott objected once more, but Hilo’s stern look\nsilenced him.\nHilo spoke again to Niko. “You’ll be sitting at the table.”\nEveryone looked surprised at this, even Wen. For four\nyears, Niko had been learning every aspect of the clan’s\noperations under the tutelage of the Horn and the Weather Man\nand other leaders on both sides of the clan. By all accounts, he\nwas contributing in useful ways. He’d proposed a new IT\nsystem on the military side of the clan that would better\noptimize deployment of Fingers across multiple regions. He\nresolved a dispute between two Lantern Men by having one\nman’s son work for the other as restitution. And he’d done\nsensitive work for Shae, gathering evidence against the\nEspenians.\nYet, so far, Hilo had given no indication as to if and when\nhe expected his nephew to start taking on any responsibilities\nfrom him directly. After all, Niko was still young, only twenty-\nseven. And many in the clan wondered if the Pillar harbored\nanger or doubts over his nephew’s years away from the family.\nNow, however, he was saying that Niko would have the\nauthority to speak for the clan in an important meeting with\ntheir former enemies. It was the first time he’d made it\nunequivocal, even around the privacy of the family dinner\ntable, that Niko was his intended heir.\nIf Niko was surprised, he didn’t show it. “I understand,\nUncle,” he said solemnly, but everyone saw the cautious way\nhe glanced at Wen for her reaction.\n“You’ll do fine,” Wen said. “Your uncle and aunt will be\nwith you, after all.” She said it more matter-of-factly than\nkindly, but Hilo was glad she’d voiced some encouragement,\neven if her smile seemed reserved.\n“I’ll be ready,” Niko promised.\n“Good.” Hilo turned to Anden. “What’s going on, Andy?\nYou’ve gone quiet and you have that expression on your face\nthat you get when something’s on your mind.”\nAnden’s head came up and he looked around the table at\nthe sudden attention of his family members. He said with a\ntouch of chagrin, “I’m sorry I seem distracted, Hilo-jen. I’ve\nbeen meaning to ask you something, but it can wait until some\nother time.”\nHilo said, “Just say it. There’s no better time, and we’re all"

There’s no better time, and we’re all\nfamily here, except for Lott Jin, but it’s impossible to be Horn\nof No Peak and not be an honorary Kaul.”\nAnden hesitated, then cleared his throat and sat up straight\nin his chair. “I want to run for political office, to become a\nmember of the Royal Council.” Everyone stared at him, until\nAnden fidgeted and said, “I know it would mean giving up my\njade. But I’ve thought long and hard about it, and I’m prepared\nto do that. Treating people in the clan one at a time is\nworthwhile work, but as an elected official I could affect many\npeople at once. I ask for your blessing, Hilo-jen, and for the\npatronage of the clan.”\nNo one said anything for a moment. Then Niko said,\n“Uncle Anden, I’d say you’re too honest to be a politician, but\ncome to think about it, you’ve already been a statesman for the\nclan for so many years, so there’s no one who’d be better\nsuited to the job.”\nWen smiled knowingly at Anden from across the table. “In\nthis family, you can be honest and still shrewd. Jadeless and\nstill a warrior.”\nAnden said, “Most members of the Royal Council who’re\naffiliated with the major clans have never worn jade\nthemselves, so they don’t always understand how to do things\nthe Green Bone way. The rest are independents, who have no\nallegiance to the Green Bone way of life at all. As for our\ninfluence there, even after Jaya broke the hold that Six Hands\nUnity has on Lukang, the election is going to be close, and the\nMountain might even get a boost from the Kobens ascending\nto power.\n“There are things that need to be done—standing up to the\nEspenians and demanding the withdrawal of troops, combating\nharmful superstitions, military reform—that need someone\nwho can speak as a Green Bone without being green. Look at\nhow the widow Koben Tin Bett has risen in government,\ncoming from a Green Bone family and advocating their views\nin national politics even though she’s never been a Green Bone\nherself. I think I could do that for us. I could represent the clan\nbut also sit apart from it and think of the greater good.”\nWen said, still smiling, “Did Jirhuya give you this idea?”\nAnden’s face reddened a little. “No, but he encouraged me.\nI don’t think I would’ve hung on to the idea if he hadn’t kept\npushing me to take it seriously.” He averted his gaze self-\nconsciously but there was a slight smile on his face. “I used to\nworry that maybe we couldn’t stay together, because he’s so\nfar outside of the clan, but now I think it’s a good thing that he\nalways gives me a different perspective.”\nHilo spoke and everyone else became quiet. “No member\nof the Kaul family has ever held political office.

We’ve always\nbeen jade warriors who’ve never given up our green for\nanything, not even the right to rule.” The side of the Pillar’s\nmouth rose in a lopsided grin. “One thing I can say about my\nlittle cousin is that he always does things his own way, even if\nit’s never been done before. Of course you have my blessing,\nAndy, and the support of the clan.”\nAnden rose from his seat and touched his clasped hands to\nhis forehead in deep salute. “Thank you, Hilo-jen. I’ll do my\nbest to win and not let everyone down.”\nHilo stood as well and the cousins embraced. Hilo said,\n“Let’s all go to bed on this good news. Shae will set up the\nmeeting with the Kobens, and then we’ll talk more. There’s\nstill a lot to do—there always is—but I’m sure you’re all\ntired.”\n_______\nAfter everyone else had departed and the house was quiet,\nHilo went upstairs. Wen was already in bed and waiting up for\nhim. When he got under the covers, she set aside the book she\nwas reading and came into his arms. He kissed her brow and\nstroked her hair. They lay together in silence for a few\nminutes.\n“When will you do it?” Wen asked.\n“During the meeting,” Hilo said. “Bringing Niko in gave\nme the excuse to keep Lott out. Not because I want to exclude\nhim, but so he can be doing other things.”\nWen nodded. “It’ll take a few weeks for the Weather Men\nto negotiate all the details of the meeting—the location, the\npenitents, the security and so on. Hopefully by then, Ayt Mada\nwill have faded from everyone’s attention. Most of her small\ngroup of loyal guards are older Green Bones, no match for our\nbest Fists.”\n“I’ll give Lott instructions tomorrow, when no one else is\naround.” He cupped Wen’s chin and tilted it up toward him.\nSternly, “You have to be careful not to let it slip to Shae. You\nmight forget. I know how you two talk when I’m not around.\nShae and Niko can’t know anything until it’s done. They can\nswear truthfully for everyone to Perceive that they had nothing\nto do with killing Ayt Mada, that I whispered her name to Lott\nalone.”\nWen pulled away in indignation. “I wouldn’t forget\nsomething so important,” she said. “Didn’t I agree with you at\nthe table tonight? Shae says it’s risky to act right now, but it’s\neven more risky not to act. We can never be careless when it\ncomes to Ayt Mada. She and her supporters have to die.”\nHilo nodded. “It’ll be a tricky thing, talking the new Pillar\ninto friendship while sending his aunt to finally feed the\nworms.”\nWen leaned her cheek against her husband’s shoulder and\ntraced the jade studs on his collarbone and chest with the\ntenderness of long familiarity. “Ayt Ato will have to make a\nfuss over it for the sake of appearances, but he won’t go to war\nover it,” she said. “Like I said, I think he’s smarter than people"

He knows Ayt Mada will be trouble to him so\nlong as she remains in the wings of the clan. He’ll never have\nthe full support of the Mountain if she’s still alive and pulling\nstrings. She never favored him as the heir, and her terrible\nshadow will loom over him as long as she lives. The Kobens\nwill be secretly grateful when we take the old Pillar out of\ntheir way.”\n“Especially if I give them an easy way out of having to\npretend to be angry,” Hilo said. “Which I will. As soon as this\nis over, I’ll step down as Pillar.”\nWen’s fingers stopped moving. She breathed out, her long\nexhalation warm against his skin. “Niko’s not ready.”\n“It would be better if he had a few more years, that’s true,\nbut this has to be the way it’s done. He’s about the same age I\nwas when I became Pillar,” Hilo said. “And no one thought\nmuch of my chances, not even you, my kitten, if we’re going\nto be honest here.”\nWen said, “You were the Horn. You had the loyalty of the\nclan’s Fists and Fingers in a time of war. You knew how to\nlead people in a crisis because you care about them. Niko’s not\nlike you.”\nHilo wrapped one of her hands in his own and sighed. “I\nknow how hard it is to forgive someone when they don’t turn\nout the way you expect. I’m not very good at it myself. But\nyou can see how Niko’s changed and how hard he’s been\nworking. You should be nicer to him and show him some\naffection even when he doesn’t ask for it or seem to want it.”\nWen was quiet for a moment. “Of course I love him, but\nhe’s like a closed book, even more so than when he was a boy.\nCan someone with a personality like that ever inspire others as\na leader? I think he needs a girlfriend, but he doesn’t seem to\nwant any of my suggestions.”\nHilo laughed. “Young people put romance off these days,\nyou shouldn’t worry too much about that. And remember that I\nwas different from Lan, and all the men who’ve been the Horn\nwere different from me and from each other. As long as Niko\nknows himself, he’ll learn to be his own sort of Pillar. Also,\nthese are better times, and he’ll have all of us standing behind\nhim. I didn’t have any advantage like that, so I know how\nimportant it is. I won’t be like Grandda, dragging other people\ndown because of his own regrets. I have you, and I’ll be glad\nthat we can finally relax a little after all these years, won’t\nyou?”\n“Yes.” Wen turned his face toward her and kissed him.\n“Whatever agreement we come to with the Mountain will\nbe between Niko and the Kobens.

I’ll abide by it happily, so\nlong as I’ve avenged Lan and Kehn and all our Fists and\nFingers that Ayt Mada put in the ground.” Hilo reached over to\nturn off the bedside lamp before settling down and pulling\nWen close. “Shae’s right; our clans should put the blood feud\nin the past. The younger generation should start fresh with a\nreal chance at peace. But our generation—we still have our\ndebts to pay.”\n_______\nThe phone rang in the home of Iwe Kalundo, where the former\nWeather Man of the Mountain had isolated himself ever since\nhis disgraceful forced resignation. Iwe answered the call and\nlistened in silence to the informer on the other end of the line.\nThen he hung up and placed a phone call of his own.\n“Ayt-jen,” he said, “I have the information we need.\nEverything will be arranged as we discussed.”\nCHAPTER\n61\nOld Tigers\nthe twenty-sixth year, twelfth month\nT\nhe secret meeting between the leaders of the No Peak and\nMountain clans, the first such occurrence in twenty-five years,\nwas held on a Seventhday morning in the headquarters of the\nKekon Jade Alliance, in the perennially neutral Temple\nDistrict.\nThe original KJA building had been a square, squat,\nutilitarian government building. Its replacement, built with\nnational and joint clan funds after the Janloon bombing, was a\nfar grander structure—ten defiant stories of steel and green\nmarble, overshadowing even the ancient stone pillars and clay\nroof of the nearby Temple of Divine Return. An enduring fuck\nyou to anyone who might imagine that the clans had been\ndestroyed or diminished by the attacks against them.\nWhen Hilo, Shae, and Niko arrived at the appointed time,\nAyt Ato and his retinue were already in the room, as were four\npenitents from the Temple of Divine Return, standing against\nthe back wall with their hands folded inside their long green\nrobes.\nThe Mountain Green Bones stood, and Ayt Ato touched his\nforehead in wary salute. “Kaul-jen.”\n“Ato-jen,” Hilo said, returning the informal gesture. “I\nhope you won’t take offense if I call you by your personal\nname. Ayt isn’t a name I’m able to say in a friendly way, so I’d\nprefer not to use it for you if we’re to start off on good terms.”\nAto said, “I don’t mind. It’s what most people call me\nanyway.”\nHilo had seen Ayt Ato’s image many times but had never\ndirectly faced the man in person before. Ato was indeed as\nhandsome as he appeared on television, nearly as camera-\nworthy as the movie star Danny Sinjo. The distinctive rows of\ntiny jade studs in his eyebrows accentuated his large eyes,\nalthough a rigidity in his face spoke to the enormous pressure\nthat the young Pillar had been under for the past two months.\nHis jade aura felt closely held and tightly stretched, frayed at\nthe edges.\nAto introduced a stout, bearded man as his Weather Man,\nKoben Opon, and a muscular Green Bone with a flat nose as"

You’ve harmed the Mountain in\nso many ways over the years. You’ve also stood with us at\ntimes and fought fiercely against criminals and clanless and\ngreedy foreigners. You brought down my aunt Mada as Pillar,\nbut now you’re here, willing to discuss friendship. So in truth,\nI don’t know what to think of you, whether you’re an enemy\nor an ally.”\n“I hope to be neither, Ato-jen.” Hilo was honestly not sure\nwhat to make of Ayt Ato either. It seemed incredible that a\nman could be in the public eye for so much of his life and still\nbe so unknown when it came to whether he had any true\ncapability. Hilo said, “You asked me here to discuss the future\nbetween our clans. I’m not the future of my clan. I’ve been\nPillar of No Peak for twenty-seven years, and I intend to step\ndown soon and hand the position to my nephew. I’ve asked\nhim to sit at the table and lead this meeting for our side. That\nway, any agreement today will be made looking forward and\nnot behind.”\nAto was surprised by this unexpected announcement, but\nhe turned toward Niko with a cautious, pleased expression.\n“It’s been a long time since we last crossed paths, Kaul Niko-\njen. We’ve both been through a lot since then, I think. I’m\nsorry if I came across as an insufferably arrogant buffoon in\nthe past. But I did say I hoped we could work together and not\nhave to follow the examples of our elders. I hope that’s still\ntrue.”\nFor the past several evenings, Niko had been sitting in long\nconsultation with his aunts and uncles, preparing for what\nwould be expected of him, being briefed on everything that\nmight come up in the discussion with the Mountain. Now, he\nstepped forward next to Hilo and said, humbly but with\nassurance, “I’m not the Pillar yet, Ato-jen, and I still have to\nprove that I’m worthy of my family’s confidence. So my aunt\nand uncle will sit at the table with me and the final decisions\nare theirs. But I want to say that I don’t hold any grudge\nagainst you or the Koben family, not even over the death of\nmy brother. I truly hope we can end this long war.”\nNiko’s mention of Ru caught Hilo off guard. It caught Ayt\nAto off guard as well; Hilo Perceived the beat of startled\nuncertainty in the other man’s jade aura. Shae darted a glance\nat both of them. Niko’s aura didn’t change. Hilo couldn’t tell if\nhis inscrutable nephew had spoken sincerely about his hopes,\nor if he’d invoked Ru’s death as a way to gain the subtle\nmental advantage over Ato and the Kobens, as if to say: I\ncould hate you. But I choose not to."

But I choose not to.\n“Since before I was born, my whole life has been defined\nby the clan war that killed my father,” Niko said. “That’s one\nthing we have in common, Ato-jen—our lives were shaped by\nthe deaths of men we never knew. Maybe we can break that\nlegacy.”\nAyt Ato studied Niko with guarded, optimistic respect. “I\nhope so, Kaul-jen.”\nThe six Green Bones sat down together at the table. As\nthey did so, Sando Kin noticed something amiss. He leaned\nover to Ato. “Where is the Horn of No Peak?”\n“I asked Lott Jin not to come, so Niko could attend without\nmaking our sides unequal,” Hilo answered. “As a former Horn\nmyself, I’ll speak for the military side of the clan.” None of\nthat was a lie. Even Green Bones with better Perception than\nthese men would not Perceive it as such.\nHilo waited until their attention was elsewhere before\nputting his hand into his pocket and depressing the button to\nsend the preloaded message on his phone.\n_______\nLott Jin sat in the front passenger seat of a black ZT Bravo in\nthe Commons district, watching the townhouse at the end of\nthe street through a pair of high-powered binoculars. Two\nGreen Bone guards walked circuits around the building, but\nthey looked bored. Lott had the townhouse under constant\nsurveillance, keeping his own Green Bones well out of\nPerception range and relying on jadeless White Rats to pass by\nand get closer looks. Ayt Mada had met her former Weather\nMan, Iwe Kalundo, for dinner at a nearby Mountain-owned\nrestaurant the previous evening. She had returned to the\ntownhouse afterward and no one had seen her emerge so far\ntoday. Lott estimated there were two other bodyguards inside,\nbut that was all. This was Mountain territory after all; Ayt’s\npeople were not overly concerned. Lott and Vin were alone in\nthe inconspicuous ZT Bravo (Lott’s red Lumezza FT Scorpion\nwould be far too recognizable) and Vin could reliably Perceive\npatrols before the patrols could Perceive them.\nLott’s pager buzzed and he looked down at it. It was the\nsignal he’d been waiting for: a short numeric code that he and\nthe Pillar had agreed would mean Hilo, Shae, and Niko were\nin the KJA building with Ayt Ato and his people, and Lott was\nto proceed.\nHe made a cell phone call. Hami Yasu picked up at once.\n“It’s time,” Lott said.\n“We’ll be there in five minutes,” said the Fist. Two cars\nfull of No Peak’s best Green Bone warriors were waiting in a\nparking lot across the district border in Old Town. As soon as\nthey arrived, they would storm the townhouse from all sides,\nkill Ayt Mada and her bodyguards, and steal back across into\nNo Peak territory. If all went according to plan, they would\ncatch Ayt unawares and it would take no more than a few\nminutes.\nLott fingered the sheathed moon blade lying across his lap."

Four Mountain\nbodyguards plus Ayt Mada, against ten of No Peak’s greenest\nfighters. Ayt Mada was still the most heavily jaded woman in\nKekon, but she was in her midsixties. Jade did not stop a\nperson from getting old, and it didn’t matter how much green\nsomeone wore if they didn’t have the physical stamina and\nreflexes to employ it, particularly against men forty years\nyounger. Nevertheless, Lott was worried. Ayt had survived\nassassination attempts before. She’d won a duel against Kaul\nShae. She’d had a knife plunged into her neck and fallen out a\nwindow. She seemed legendary, unkillable.\nIt was possible that other Mountain Green Bones would be\nalerted and rush to her aid. Bystanders might get in the way.\nThere might be other guards inside that they didn’t know\nabout, as they were parked too far away for even Vin to\nPerceive how many people were inside. Lott sent up a silent\nprayer to the gods. By nature, he was a risk-averse person. He\nknew he was not unusually talented, but he’d reached the\nposition of Horn as a result of being lucky, hardworking, and\ndependable, giving others no reason to doubt him or his ability\nto deliver on his responsibilities. Now the Pillar was counting\non him, had left this final mission in his hands.\nVin started the car engine. A minute later, two Victor STX\nSUVs roared past them up the street. “That’s them, let’s go,”\nLott said. Vin hit the gas, and they tore down the length of the\nblock to the townhouse, squealing to a stop behind the other\nvehicles. Lott threw open the door and dove out.\nThe two guards patrolling the building Perceived the\nmurderous rush and raced to defend the entrance. They drew\nAnkev pistols, but they were badly outgunned. Shotgun\nmuzzles aimed out the open windows of the lead SUV sprayed\nthem with ammunition. The Mountain Green Bones threw up a\nsurge of Deflection that sent the pellets flying into the\ntownhouse’s windows, peppering the siding and shattering\nwindows. One man’s Steel was not quick or strong enough; he\ntook lead to the knees and went down screaming and clutching\nhis legs.\nIn the brief pause after the first volley of gunfire, No Peak\nGreen Bones exploded out of the cars with guns and blades\nand were upon the sentries in an instant. Suyo and Hami shot\nthe man on the ground several times at close range, his body\njumping on the lawn as if from hammer blows as his Steel\ncollapsed under the barrage. Juen Din flew Light at the other\nguard, moon blade descending in a lethal overhead chop.\nWhen the guard raised his own blade to meet the high attack,\nJuen Ritto rushed into the opening in a blur of Strength and\ndisemboweled the man in the time it took to blink.\nLott and Vin were already flying past the fighting on the\nlawn.

They\nbraced to Steel themselves, but the door slammed open on its\nhinges, revealing an empty hall. No trip wires were snagged,\nnothing exploded. Lott was about to rush inside when Vin\nshouted, “Wait!”\nLott turned to his First Fist with alarm. Vin tapped the side\nof his head and pointed to the house. “Can you Perceive that?\nNothing. There’s no one inside.”\nThe Horn took a wary step closer, throwing knives in hand,\nstretching out his Perception to take in as much of the building\nas he could. Vin was right. He couldn’t sense a single jade aura\nin the house.\n“That’s impossible,” he exclaimed. “We saw Ayt go inside\nthe house yesterday and we’ve had eyes on the building all\nnight and this morning. No one came in or out.”\nNo one doubted Vin’s Perception, but they searched the\nhouse anyway. It was empty. There were signs that Ayt Mada\nhad been here recently: dishes in the kitchen, food in the\nfridge, clothes in the bedroom—but no one in the house. The\nback door was still locked. No Peak Green Bones had\nsurrounded the townhouse and they were certain no one had\nleft through the windows. Ayt and her bodyguards had\nvanished.\nVibrating with furious disbelief, Lott walked back out to\nthe front lawn and crouched beside the guard lying on the\nground with his entrails spilled out, still alive but only for a\nshort while longer. “Ayt was here,” he said. “How did she\nleave?”\nThe guard didn’t answer. His face was waxen and sweaty\nand he was gazing far away. Lott stood and ground a foot on\nthe man’s open abdomen, eliciting a scream. The sound made\nLott wince, but there were times cruelty couldn’t be avoided.\nHe waited until the dying man’s eyes focused on him. “Suyo\nhere is excellent at Channeling,” Lott said, motioning the Fist\nover. “Tell me how Ayt Mada got away and where she went,\nand I’ll have him end your pain in an instant. Otherwise, I’ll\nthrow you in one of our cars and ask him to stop the bleeding\nenough to keep you alive and suffering for hours.”\n“Tunnel,” the man moaned. “I don’t know where she went,\nbut this building … used to be a safe house for the Clanless\nFuture Movement. There’s a tunnel … under the laundry\nroom.”\n“Godsdamnit,” Lott breathed. He pointed to the guard.\n“Save him if you can, kill him if you can’t,” he told Suyo. He\ngave instructions to Vin and half the other Green Bones to find\nand follow Ayt’s escape route. He ordered the other half to get\nin one of the cars and follow him. “We need to get to the\nKekon Jade Alliance building.”\n_______\nAyt Ato leaned over to consult quietly with his Weather Man\nbefore turning back to the table. “We’re amenable to the idea\nof Euman Island being officially declared clan neutral"

A national park ought to\nbe established to protect that area from further exploitation.\nBut how do you propose to deal with the foreigners?”\nNiko took a moment to confer with Shae before answering.\n“From what we know about how the criminal investigation\ninto the company’s CEO is unfolding, it seems likely that\nAnorco will be broken up and sold. Its assets include a sizable\namount of jade inventory. I’m sure we can all agree that we\nwant that jade back in Kekon and not in the hands of other\nforeign companies or criminal organizations.” When Ato and\nhis people nodded, Niko said, “The Weather Man has a\nproposal.”\nHilo had told his nephew, When in doubt, get your aunt to\ndo some talking. She’ll say something smart, and meanwhile\nyou can watch them and have time to think ahead.\nShae leaned forward. “If the Mountain and No Peak both\ntry to acquire Anorco’s jade, we’ll end up in a bidding contest,\none that could turn violent and have us at each other’s throats\nagain. We propose that our clans form a joint venture company\nunder the auspices of the Kekon Jade Alliance, to acquire\nAnorco’s reserves and allocate them in the same way as jade\nproduced from the mines—equitably between the Green Bone\nclans, as well as to schools, temples, doctors, and the national\ntreasury.”\nHilo was finding it difficult to pay attention to what was\narguably the most significant and far-ranging negotiation that\nhad ever happened between the Mountain and No Peak. He\nglanced surreptitiously at his watch. At this moment, the Horn\nwas leading a team of the clan’s strongest Fists in an attack on\nAyt Mada’s residence.\n“That seems reasonable,” Ato replied. “But can we expect\nany trouble from the Espenian government, after what\nhappened this summer with the GSI soldiers?” Ato glanced at\nHilo. “To be clear, I admire what you did, Kaul-jen. Making a\npublic statement like that. It played so well on television. I\nwish I’d thought of it myself, honestly. Although, of course, I\nwasn’t in a position to say so at the time.”\nHilo brought his attention back to the conversation. “Don’t\nworry about GSI,” he said. “As for the Espenian government,\nthey’ll gladly pretend it didn’t happen.”\nShae said, “The ROE is already lagging in its diplomatic\ncommitments to reduce its military presence, and the protests\nand deaths of unarmed civilians hardly plays to their\nadvantage. If the clans stand together, we can put even greater\npressure on them.”\nAyt Ato said, “We have a common interest in cooperating\nagainst overreaching foreigners, but we also need to discuss\nhow we’ll treat our clans’ overseas markets.”\nHilo’s phone vibrated.

He waited until he had an\nopportunity to discreetly take it out of his pocket, flip it open,\nand sneak a glance at the small green screen, which displayed\ntwo lines of text from Lott Jin: Escaped. Before we arrived.\nHilo closed the phone and slid it back into his pocket.\nSlowly, he leaned back in the chair and breathed in and out,\ncalming himself, not wanting to betray his fury and agitation.\nNiko was focused on the conversation with the Kobens, as he\nshould be, and didn’t notice any change in his uncle’s aura.\nHis nephew’s Perception had never been any better than\naverage. Shae, however, was glancing at Hilo suspiciously,\nquestioningly. Even without any jade senses, his sister could\ntell something was amiss.\nA dull roar began to fill Hilo’s head. Fuck the gods. Ayt\nMada, always one step ahead, even now—publicly disgraced,\nunpopular, old and ousted from power—she was not yet\ndefeated, not yet dead. Which meant that the bitch was still\ngoing to make a play, still going to find some way to get what\nshe wanted, to bring down everyone who stood in her way.\nWherever she was now, she was still a threat to No Peak, to\nthe family.\nNiko and Ato, in consultation with their respective\nWeather Men, had agreed that the clans would no longer block\neach other’s expansion overseas. No Peak would allow the\nMountain to enter Espenia and set up businesses there without\nattacking their operations or their people, directly or through\nallies. In exchange, the Mountain would extend the same\ncourtesy to No Peak, allowing it to expand into Shotar,\nYgutan, and the Uwiwa Islands, where the Mountain had been\ndominant for decades.\nAt last, they turned to the heart of the negotiation, the\ndecision that would seal peace between the clans: a pledge of\nfriendship between the Koben and Kaul families. As the\npetitioners of the meeting, the Kobens were expected to make\nthe overture. Hilo could tell, however, that Ato was still\nuncertain. He wanted greater assurance from the Kauls, whom\nhe had no reason to trust.\nAto cleared his throat. “You don’t have a girlfriend you’re\nplanning to marry, do you, Kaul Niko-jen?”\nThe question surprised Hilo, but Niko answered without so\nmuch as blinking. “No,” he said. “Not yet.”\nAto said, “Since our families hope to be friends, I hope\nyou won’t consider it too forward that I offer to introduce you\nto some of my younger cousins who are about your age.” He\nglanced cautiously at Hilo. “With your uncle’s permission, of\ncourse.”\nHilo’s eyes narrowed. “I know the Kobens are an\nadmirably traditional family, but a man’s heart is his own.”\n“Nevertheless, I would be happy to meet your cousins,”\nNiko said to Ato without smiling or hesitating. “My uncle is\nconcerned for my happiness, but my heart’s more sensible and\nless picky than a lot of other men.”\n“I’m glad you’re willing to consider it,” Ato said. “After\nall, words, money, and even jade—they don’t bind people"

That’s something that\nhasn’t changed even in modern times, wouldn’t you agree?”\nAto stood and his Horn and Weather Man stood with him.\nWith ceremonial deliberation, the young Pillar placed his\nmoon blade on the table in front of Niko. The weapon was a\nfine thirty-three inches in a beautifully carved scabbard and\nwith small inset jade stones running down the length of its\nblack hilt.\n“Kaul-jens,” Ato said, speaking formally to all of them,\n“as Pillar of the Mountain, I pledge to you my friendship, the\nhonor of my family, and the strength of my clan. I give my\nblade to you in service.”\nNiko, Hilo, and Shae stood as well. The sheathed thirty-\nfour-inch Da Tanori moon blade that Niko set on the table in\nfront of Ayt Ato was made of twenty-two inches of tempered\nwhite carbon steel, with five jade stones in the hilt. It had once\nbelonged to his father.\nLan, are you watching? Hilo wondered, with a tight\nfeeling in his chest. This was what his brother had wanted, so\nmany years ago. No Peak strong enough to stand against any\nfoe. True peace between the clans, as equals.\nBullshit. Something was wrong. Hilo could sense it like a\nghostly flickering in the periphery of his Perception, or\nperhaps it was simply the terrible knowledge of being\noutmaneuvered by Ayt Mada yet again, even after everything\nhe’d done, every sacrifice his family had made, every last drop\nof his clan’s strength, cunning, and resolve given over the\nyears. Shae was glancing at him frequently now. Despite his\nefforts to appear unperturbed, the other Green Bones in the\nroom could not fail to Perceive the disquiet in Hilo’s jade aura.\nNiko looked over at him. “Uncle?”\nHilo forced a smile. “This is a difficult and emotional\nmoment for me. I hope you all understand. I’ve fought the\nMountain clan all my life, so it’s hard for me to accept this is\nhappening, even if I agree. I’m glad I made the decision to\nhave Niko speak.”\nHis sincere explanation satisfied everyone, except for\nShae, whose gaze lingered on him another moment before\nturning back to the matter at hand. Hilo stretched his\nPerception out through the building and onto the street. Both\nclans had Green Bones standing guard outside, but nothing\nwas out of the ordinary. Hilo brought his focus back, rested his\nPerception carefully on every person in the room in turn.\nNiko echoed Ato’s words. “As the Pillar’s son, I pledge to\nyou my friendship, the honor of my family, and the strength of\nmy clan. I give my blade to you in service.”\nA pledge of friendship, sealed with a personal exchange of\nmoon blades, was not made lightly between Green Bones. It\nmeant they could not go to war with each other, at least not\nbefore failing at other means of resolution and formally\nbreaking the friendship by symbolically returning the other’s"

It\nmeant they could not go to war with each other, at least not\nbefore failing at other means of resolution and formally\nbreaking the friendship by symbolically returning the other’s\nblade, since it was unthinkable to take a warrior’s weapon and\nuse his own jade to strike him down—tantamount to theft.\nFrom now on, anyone who attacked the Kobens would be an\nenemy of the Kauls, and vice versa. Each would come to the\naid of the other if asked.\nThe practical implication of this promise in the short term\nwas that No Peak would help the Kobens to put down any\nmutinous challenge, by Ayt Mada loyalists or anyone else, and\nto support them as the rightful ruling family of the Mountain\nclan. It was what Ato needed more than anything at the\nmoment, even if it meant appearing to lower himself to the\nKauls.\nAto smiled a movie-star bright smile that did not quite\nreach his eyes. “I’m not like my aunt,” he said. “I’m not\nashamed to admit that. I don’t believe that one clan has to\nprevail over the other, and I promise I’ll do everything I can to\nput the long grudges behind us. Under Heaven and on jade.”\nNiko inclined his head. “When I was a boy, I felt a lot of\npressure to one day match you, Ato-jen,” he said. “Now I\nwelcome you giving me a good reason to feel that way. I’m\nstill a Pillar-in-training, so I can speak for my clan only with\nthe final blessing of my uncle.” He turned to Hilo.\nHilo’s eyes focused on Ato and he nodded. “Under Heaven\nand on jade,” he declared, then drew his pistol and fired twice.\n_______\nThe shots went over Ayt Ato’s shoulder and hit the penitent\nbehind him. Shae saw the man’s brains spray out across the\nwall. The Fullerton carbine he’d begun to raise to waist height\nbeneath his voluminous green robes fell from his hands and\nclattered to the floor. As everyone else in the room spun in\nalarm, Shae glimpsed the baleful, fiery vindication in her\nbrother’s eyes, his expression twisted with savage\nunderstanding.\nThe other penitents opened fire.\nSando Kin threw himself onto his cousin, pushing Ato\nunder the table. The bullets meant for the young Pillar tore\nthrough Sando’s back. Hilo fired again and hit another penitent\nin the chest, then began to raise a Deflection as the remaining\ntwo guns turned on him. A split-second realization as his jade\nenergy swelled: In the tight quarters of the meeting room, the\nDeflected bullets would swerve into Niko and Shae.\nHilo twisted and sent the Deflection straight into his\nnephew’s chest. The force of it knocked Niko to the ground.\nBullets chopped through the air above him and stitched into\nHilo’s side.\nShae saw her brother fall as if in slow motion. Later, she\nwouldn’t remember anything else. She wouldn’t recall\nthrowing herself to the ground under the desk. She would have\nno memory of the Green Bone guards outside charging into\nthe room with drawn weapons, Koben Opon shouting for them"

She would have\nno memory of the Green Bone guards outside charging into\nthe room with drawn weapons, Koben Opon shouting for them\nto cut down the remaining two penitents, who were not\npenitents at all. She would remember only the jerk of Hilo’s\nbody and the pistol falling from his hands, the way her\nbrother’s shoulders struck the wall before he slid to the floor.\nThe next sound to break into Shae’s awareness was a\nragged cry next to her underneath the desk. Ato had pushed\nhimself out from underneath Sando Kin and was holding his\ncousin’s limp body, clutching his face and keening. “No no no\nno …”\nShae scrambled over to Hilo on hands and knees. He was\nslumped against the wall, his legs straight out in front of him\nas if he were slouched lazily after a hard workout. His face\nwas contorted with pain. Shae watched in horror as blood\nspread across his shirt and pants, pooled around her knees on\nthe hardwood floor.\n“Hilo.” She could not say anything else.\nNiko crawled over to them. He stared down at his uncle\nand went completely, terrifyingly still. In that moment, Shae\nsaw another face emerge beneath that of the coolly determined\nyoung man her nephew had become. She saw unmistakably\nthe face of the frightened toddler in the airport, the one who\nwould follow her around the house and clutch her legs, full of\nconfusion and loss.\n“Niko.” When he didn’t answer, she shouted, “Niko!” He\nlooked at her, eyes blank with fear. She seized his hands and\npressed them over Hilo’s wounds. “Do you remember\nemergency medical Channeling? Try to stop the bleeding. I’ll\ncall an ambulance.” She grabbed her bag and fumbled for her\ncell phone with shaking hands. Where was it? Gods, please\nplease please. Her thoughts turned into an unthinking litany of\npleading. She found it, began to punch in the emergency\nnumber.\nHilo shook his head vehemently and grabbed her by the\nfront of her shirt, his hands twisted in the fabric. “Get me\nhome, Shae,” he said, his voice strained.\n“We need to get you to a hospital.”\nHilo shook his head again. “I’m not dying in a fucking\nhospital.”\n“You’re not going to die,” she told him.\n“Shae,” Hilo said gently, “I can’t feel my legs. I want to go\nhome. I want to see Wen. Please, Shae.”\nShe began to cry. There was no warning—only the abrupt,\nhot blurring of vision, the strangling pressure in her chest. Hilo\ngripped her tighter, more impatiently. “Are you my Weather\nMan or not?”\nAll of a sudden, they were surrounded by No Peak Green\nBones. Lott Jin was there—When had he arrived? How had he\ngotten here? Shae did not know. The Horn stared down at\nthem, ashen-faced. Then he shoved Niko aside roughly and\nshouted, “Suyo!” One of his senior Fists rushed over, dropped\nto his knees and began Channeling while Lott and several\nothers applied pressure to the wounds.\nHilo screamed in pain and frustration. “Get me home,"

Then she shouted. “Do\nas he says!”\nSeveral Fists together lifted Hilo and took him outside. He\nsagged between them, his legs limp, trailing blood as they\ncarried him to the ZT Bravo parked beside the building. They\nplaced him across the back seat, where he lay breathing\nraggedly, eyes closed. Niko got in with him, cradling Hilo’s\nhead and shoulders in his lap. Shae got into the front passenger\nseat and hung on to the door of the car, her head pressed\nagainst the window glass as if the vehicle were a life raft.\nLott rushed them home. The only thing Shae remembered\nfrom the journey was Niko’s voice, almost too quiet to be\nheard. “Da,” he begged, “don’t leave me.”\nHilo did not answer.\nWhen the car stopped and the doors opened in front of the\nmain house, Anden was there. Someone must’ve called him, to\ntell him what happened and warn him to be prepared. Even so,\nwhen he saw his cousin, Anden swayed violently, as if he’d\nbeen struck across the face. He put a hand against the ZT’s\ndoor frame to steady himself. Then he went to work. Before\nthey even had Hilo out of the vehicle, Anden was Channeling\nfor all he was worth, forcing blood to clot, raising the Pillar’s\nbody temperature, forcing energy into his heart and lungs. By\nnow, Hilo was barely conscious; his eyes were closed and his\nface waxen.\nWen ran to the front door, saw her husband, and collapsed\nto the ground with a wail of pure animal pain.\n“I’m not a godsdamned surgeon,” Anden cried at Shae.\n“Would it make a difference?” she asked numbly. “Just do\nwhat he wants.”\nHilo was laid out on his bed and Anden worked feverishly\nto keep him alive and dull the pain. At times, he barked orders\nand others ran to help him or bring him supplies. During that\ntime, word of what happened spread through No Peak and\nmembers of the clan began to gather silently in front of the\nKaul estate. Fists and Fingers, Luckbringers, Lantern Men.\nCars began to arrive, packing the road around the house.\nMakeshift Deitist shrines went up along the gate, dozens of\ncups of incense trailing smoke.\nLott Jin went out and came back again to report that the\nentire city was in shock. The Mountain clan was in turmoil.\nAyt Ato was alive, but his Horn was dead, and his Weather\nMan was in critical condition from a gunshot wound to the\nchest. Four penitents from the Temple of Divine Return had\nbeen found tied and gagged, locked inside the stairwell of a\nparking garage near the Kekon Jade Alliance building.

One of the four mercenaries had survived long enough\nto confess that they’d been hired by Iwe Kalundo and\npromised an enormous sum of money by Ayt Madashi for the\nmurder of everyone in the room.\n“They were told to wait until the pledge of friendship had\nbeen made and moon blades exchanged,” Lott said. “Then\nthey were supposed to kill Ayt Ato first.”\nShae sat in the kitchen, hugging her arms, folded in on\nherself and staring at nothing. Ayt Mada had whispered the\nname of her own nephew. She’d never intended to pass the\nleadership of the clan to Ato, only to lure them all into the\nbelief that she had. That afternoon, after she’d sat across from\nShae, serving her tea, after they’d talked of sacrifice and\nvision, of ending feuds and doing the right thing for the\ncountry, Ayt had resigned her position in anticipation of one\nfinal opportunity—the Kauls and the Kobens in the same\nroom, discussing what the future would be without her. When\nthey were all dead, she’d claim that the Kobens had betrayed\nthe clan by pledging friendship to the Kauls. She would install\nher preferred successor, Iwe Kalundo, and rule from behind\nhim.\nThe phone in the study rang and Lott answered it. After he\nhung up, he said, “They have her.” Vin and his men had\nfollowed the tunnel under Ayt’s townhouse into Janloon’s\nsubway system. By then, the Koben family was on the hunt as\nwell. Every Green Bone in the city was looking for Ayt Mada,\nbut within an hour, she showed up back on the Ayt estate. She\nwalked onto the grounds and into her office as if it were an\nordinary day. That was where the Mountain’s people had\nfound her.\n“They say she didn’t try to run, or fight,” Lott said.\n“No,” Shae said. Ayt Mada would never flee Janloon like a\ncriminal, nor waste energy toward no purpose. As soon as\nshe’d learned her nephew and the Kauls were still alive, she’d\nsurrendered, knowing her final, murderous gambit was over.\nBecause of Hilo, Shae thought. Because old tigers\nunderstand each other.\nAnden came down the stairs. His eyes were ringed with\nexhaustion and he looked pale and aged. “I’ve done all I can. I\nstopped the bleeding, put him on an IV line, stabilized his\ntemperature and blood pressure for now. He’s loaded with\npainkillers.” Anden rubbed a hand over his face, then looked\nup at the family, tearful. “All it buys him is a few more hours,\nmaybe the rest of night. A bullet went through his spine, and\nthe others tore up his insides. He’s conscious right now, but it\nmight not be for long.”\nAnden sat down next to Jirhuya on the sofa and put his\nface in his hands.\nShae went up to see her brother.

When Shae touched Hilo’s\nshoulder, she nearly drew back at the shocking change in his\njade aura—the smooth, bright river was a dim trickle. His eyes\nwere open and focused, however, and he said to his wife and\nnephew, “Let me talk to my Weather Man, alone, just for a\nminute.”\nAfter Wen and Niko had stepped out of the room, Shae\ncrouched down near the head of the bed. A thousand things\ncame into her throat and closed it completely.\nThe Pillar asked, “Is Ato alive?”\nShae nodded and told him everything she knew. “Ayt\nwhispered all of our names. She only resigned and handed\npower to the Kobens to mislead them. To mislead me.”\nA weak smile crawled up Hilo’s face. “But she failed.\nShe’s done. This was her last shot, and she got me, in the end.\nBut she didn’t get us. That’s what’s important.” He licked his\nlips. His eyes were glassy but bright, and he turned them on\nher with insistence. “Shae, you have to help Niko. You have to\nmake him better. A better Pillar, a better person. Help him, the\nway you helped me.”\n“You know that I will,” Shae said.\nHilo closed his eyes. Shae pressed her hand over his heart\nand listened to his labored breathing. He asked her, “Is there\nanything you want me to say to Lan?”\nShae bowed her head over him. “Please, don’t talk like this\nHilo,” she whispered. “I can’t handle it. I can’t stand to think\nI’ll be the last one left.”\n“You’re not.”\nA noise rose from outside. Shae did not at first recognize it\nas the rumble of a huge crowd. She went to the window and\ndrew back the curtain. Lott Jin had opened the gates of the\nKaul estate and let in the clan’s Green Bones—hundreds of\nthem were standing in the driveway. Shae saw the entire Juen\nfamily, Hami Tuma and his son Yasu, and Maik Cam. She saw\nTerun Bin and Luckbringers from her office standing\nalongside Vin the Sniper and Hejo, the First Fist of White\nRats. She saw her own husband and daughter, Woon’s arm\naround Tia’s shoulders, both of them looking up at Lott Jin,\nwho stood on top of the Duchesse Imperia in front of the\nhouse. When the Horn raised his arm, all the clan’s warriors\nshouted, and the sound of their combined voices thundered.\n“The clan is our blood, and the Pillar is its master!”\nThe crowd stayed for the rest of the night. Every once in a\nwhile, their voices rose up in spontaneous chorus, proclaiming\ntheir allegiance. Wen and Niko and Anden came back into the\nroom, and Hilo said, “Stop looking so godsdamned glum,\neveryone.

He joked\nthat it was true the closer you got to the afterlife, the more you\nbelieved in it, and personally he couldn’t wait to see Ru again.\nHe reminded them of all the times they’d persevered despite\nthe odds, and all the things they’d done. “I’m lucky, really.”\nHe said he would try to hang on until Jaya got home, but at\nsome point he slipped into unconsciousness with Wen holding\nhis hand. The rest of the family left the two of them together in\nthe end. Shae sat with Anden, her head on his shoulder,\ngripping his left hand and wrist in her own, both of them using\nhis jade, Shae unflinchingly for the first time in years, to keep\nHilo in their Perception as long as they could. In the early\nhours of the morning, as dawn broke over the skyline of\nJanloon, Shae felt her brother’s irrepressible jade aura fade out\nof her mind.\nHours later, Wen emerged from the bedroom, dressed in\nwhite from head to toe. She said nothing, but went out into the\ngarden where she had been married and sat under the cherry\ntree in the courtyard to mourn from the bottom of her soul.\nCHAPTER\n62\nPillar of Kekon\nthe first weeks\nW\nhen word reached Jaya in Toshon that her father had been\nshot and would not survive for long, she got onto a motorcycle\nand drove through the night up the KI-1 freeway at top speed\nfor ten straight hours. She arrived too late. Her cousin Cam\nand her uncle Anden met her at the gates of the estate and told\nher that her father had died from his injuries two hours ago.\nJaya stormed into the house, shrieking with grief and rage.\nShe found Niko sitting in the living room, his head bowed in\nsolemn conference with the Horn and Weather Man. “Why\nhaven’t you done anything?” she demanded. “I’m going to call\ntwenty of my Little Knives up here and go after Ayt and Iwe\nmyself. I’ll cut them into pieces!”\n“You won’t do anything,” Niko said to his younger sister.\n“The Mountain is already in an uproar. We’ll wait to see how\nthe Kobens handle it first.”\nJaya said to Lott, “So we’re going to sit back and leave it\nto those fools?”\n“Niko-jen is the Pillar now,” the Horn reminded her. “It’s\nhis call.”\nShae said, “Niko exchanged a pledge of friendship with\nAto, so we won’t act until we’ve heard from the leaders of the\nMountain. Ayt Mada intended to murder all of us, but her most\nserious offense is betraying her own nephew after naming him\nher successor. If there’s anything we need you to do, you’ll get\nyour orders from the Horn.” When Jaya opened her mouth to\nargue again, Shae said sternly, “You’re a first-rank Fist; show\nrespect.”\nJaya wheeled on her aunt with tears spilling from her eyes."

You always had a soft spot for that evil hag,\nbut you never showed love to your own brother, you\ncoldhearted bitch.”\nShae slapped her niece hard in the face, twice, across one\ncheek and then the other. Jaya ran from the house and was not\nseen for days. The Horn sent two of his Green Bones to follow\nher and make sure she didn’t do anything rash, but he needn’t\nhave worried. Jaya’s base of command was in the south and\nwithout her own people in the city, she could not do much.\nNevertheless, in a haze of vengeful anguish, Jaya made her\nway to Iwe Kalundo’s residence in Cherry Grove, only to find\nit already surrounded by Mountain clan members calling for\nthe former Weather Man’s execution. As Shae predicted, the\nconsequences of the assassination plot were rapidly\nunspooling. The backlash against Ayt and Iwe was\nsurprisingly swift and strong. Public tolerance for Green Bone\nleaders murdering their way into power was lower than it had\nbeen thirty years ago. Ayt’s violent choices had once been\naccepted as those of a legitimate ruler defeating less worthy\nrivals. Now they were viewed as the treachery of an old tyrant\ndesperate to hold on to power. Many in the Mountain clan had\ncontinued to regard Ayt Mada favorably even after her\nresignation, but for the crime of grotesquely violating the\nsacred peace-keeping role of Deitist penitents, everyone\nexcept her most committed followers denounced her.\nNo one, it seemed, could find out where Ayt Mada was\nnow being held by the Kobens, but outside Iwe Kalundo’s\nhouse, Jaya watched along with dozens of spectators as Fists\nof the Mountain arrived to demand the traitor surrender\nhimself.\nIwe asked for three hours to prepare himself for death. The\nformer Weather Man composed a letter explaining that he’d\nonly ever wanted to prevent the clan he loved from falling to\nincompetent leadership and eventual destruction by its\nenemies. He thanked his former Pillar, Ayt Madashi,\napologized to his family, and gave instructions as to the\ndistribution of his jade upon his death. Then he dressed in his\nbest suit, walked into the courtyard of his house, and shot\nhimself in the head.\n_______\nAll over Janloon and across Kekon, spirit guiding lamps went\nup to recognize the passing of Kaul Hiloshudon, a man as\ndramatic in death as he had been in life, let the gods recognize\nhim. The televised public vigil and funeral were enormous. It\nseemed every Green Bone in the country, whether they were\ngrieving friends or celebratory enemies, had a story to tell\nabout their personal encounters with Kaul Hilo—his exploits\nas a young man, his cunning as a Horn and his determination\nas a Pillar, his famous generosity and fearsomeness.\nThe Kaul house was draped in white.

The day was dry but\novercast, the sky streaked with purple clouds. The gongs and\nfuneral drums seemed to reverberate through the streets of a\ncity leached of color.\nAll these people around him, Anden thought, felt as if they\nknew Hilo in some way, no matter how small. When Anden\nlooked out at the sea of faces, he felt strangely, ungenerously\nresentful of all of them, savagely jealous of their sadness, as if\nthere was only so much of it for him and they were not entitled\nto it. They were not Hilo’s brothers. They did not truly know\nhim. They had not Channeled their own energy into his body\nin his final hours.\nAnden left the funeral reception early and found Niko\nalone in the study—the room that had belonged to Lan and\nthen to Hilo and that now belonged to him.\n“Niko-s—” Anden began, then caught himself. His little\nnephew, who he’d pushed on the swing set and taken to\nrelayball games, who used to curl up quietly next to him on the\nsofa, holding out storybook after storybook asking to be read\nto, was now the Pillar of the clan. Anden touched clasped\nhands to his forehead and bent into a properly respectful\nsalute. “You wanted to talk to me, Kaul-jen?”\nNiko looked up from the armchair where he’d been sitting\nwith his elbows on his knees, as if studying the carpet. “Don’t\ndo that,” he pleaded, his face stricken. “When we’re around\nother people, it’s okay, but when it’s just the two of us, don’t\ntreat me any differently. Please, Uncle Anden. It’s hard enough\nbeing in this room.” The young man’s voice was calm yet\nunspeakably desolate, full of a quiet, private panic.\n“I’m sorry, Niko, that was thoughtless of me.” Anden took\nthe seat next to his nephew and looked around the study,\ntaking in the cluttered desk, flat-screen television, family\nphotographs, wall-mounted moon blades, mini-fridge,\nchildren’s artwork from decades ago that Hilo had put up and\nnever taken down.\n“I miss him,” Niko whispered. “I loved him, and\nsometimes I think I hated him. I’m nothing like him and don’t\nwant to be. Yet somehow all I want is to live up to him.”\nAnden understood how Niko felt, although he also knew\nhis own grief had not yet fully arrived. Rather than shut down\nentirely, he’d thrown himself headlong into the things he could\ndo: helping Shae to make the funeral arrangements, working\non his election campaign, handling questions from the media\nand condolences from all parts of the clan including tributaries"

On some level, he did not yet believe that\nHilo was gone and expected his cousin to walk through the\ndoor at any minute. The mind cannot adjust quickly to a\nfundamental change in reality without breaking. If the moon\nvanished from the sky, people would not believe it; they would\nthink it was a trick of light or clouds. Anden felt it would be a\nlong time before he accepted the truth.\nNiko turned to him. “Is there any way, any chance at all,\nthat I can persuade you not to run for the Royal Council? If\nthere is … I would ask you to be my Pillarman.” His\nexpression was almost childlike in its hopefulness. “I trust you\nmore than anyone, Uncle Anden. You’ve always been a Green\nBone in your own way. You’ve never held any official position\nor lost yourself to the clan, yet everyone knows you’re a man\nof No Peak. You’re always honest with me. I’m going to need\nyour advice now, more than ever.”\nAnden looked down at his hands. In the silence, he could\nhear the mingled strains of harp music and the muted noise of\npeople from the enormous gathering outside, too large to fit in\nthe courtyard and spilling all over the estate grounds. “I’ve\nthought about suspending my campaign,” he admitted. “I’m\nnot sure I can handle it right now, and it seems selfish. But\nthen Jirhu asked me what I thought Hilo-jen would want me to\ndo, and of course, I know the answer to that.” He raised his\neyes back to his nephew. “I’m sorry, Niko-se. As you said,\nI’ve always made my own way in the clan without any official\nposition. It’s been the right thing for everyone, I think. It\nshould stay that way.”\nNiko’s face fell, but he nodded as if it was the answer he’d\nbeen expecting. Anden added firmly, “You can always come to\nme, no matter what. I don’t have to be your Pillarman for that.\nAnd I’m not the only one, of course. Your aunt Shae says\nshe’ll remain Weather Man for another year, and Terun Bin\nwill be a worthy successor. Lott is a strong and prudent Horn,\nand there are the Juens, and your sister is the sort of Green\nBone every clan needs. And your ma—she knows the clan\nbest.”\n“She hasn’t spoken to me.” Niko’s voice was quiet. “I\nthink she blames me, again.”\nAnden shook his head. Wen had not spoken to anyone as\nshe kept vigil day and night for her husband’s spirit. If his\npresence were to appear to anyone, it would be to her. “It’s\nonly because she loved Hilo so much that it seems that way to\nyou. She’s too green in the soul to leave us for very long.”\nAnden stood. “If you’re willing to take my advice right now,\nI’d say you should choose Maik Cam to be your Pillarman.\nYour cousin has a lot of common sense and is an old friend\nthat you can count on to care about you and always tell the\ntruth.”"

The sense of grave burden was still there, but\nthere was also, Anden saw with relief, composure and\nacceptance. Anden felt a heavy weight lift off his chest, one\nthat he hadn’t known had been sitting there until now. He’ll be\nokay.\nAs Anden left the study, he saw Wen come silently into the\nhall, walking slowly and with care, a white-clad vision of\nsorrow and dignity. She seemed unspeakably delicate yet\nenduring, like a finely wrought vessel, broken and hollowed\nout, but too strongly tempered to crumble off its pedestal.\nAnden stepped aside as the widow and matriarch of No\nPeak walked past him toward Niko, her immaculately\npowdered face held as still as a ceramic mask. She stopped in\nfront of her son. The Pillar’s fragile new confidence wavered\nand slipped off his shoulders. Anden saw his throat bob, twice,\nand his mouth trembled as he looked into her eyes. “Ma,” he\nsaid.\nWen did not speak, but her quiet strength seemed to fold in\non itself like the petals of a flower in the cold. She stepped\nforward and wrapped her arms tightly around Niko with a\nwhisper that Anden couldn’t hear. Like a child, Niko buried\nhis face in her shoulder, and Anden, heart aching, quietly shut\nthe door of the study.\n_______\nA steady stream of people—Lantern Men, politicians,\nemissaries from tributary clans and No Peak’s overseas offices\n—arrived over the following weeks to pay respect and\nallegiance to Kaul Nikoyan. Some in the clan didn’t take well\nto the pledge of friendship with their old enemies, or were\nskeptical of Niko’s youth, inexperience, personal demeanor,\nand past failings—but the sentiments never rose to anything\nabove grumbling. No one could dispute that Kaul Hilo had\nchosen his nephew as his successor, and with Hilo’s longtime\nWeather Man and Horn both standing behind the new Pillar,\nthe clan soon fell into line.\nTen days after the funeral, Ayt Ato appeared at the Kaul\nestate accompanied only by a pair of bodyguards and asked to\nspeak with the Pillar of No Peak. This was a remarkable\noccurrence. Ordinarily, a meeting between two Pillars of\ncomparable status would be formally arranged on neutral\nground by the clans’ Weather Men. For one Pillar to present\nhimself at another’s home and request an audience like any\nordinary petitioner was a sign of debasement.\nShae watched her nephew greet the other Pillar in the\nfoyer. “Ayt Ato-jen.”\n“Kaul-jen.” Ato’s handsome face was worn down.

The tiny\njade studs over his eyebrows accentuated not his eyes but the\ndark hollows underneath them. He cleared his throat\nuncomfortably. “I’ve decided to reclaim my maternal family\nname of Koben. It’s the name I grew up with. When I was\npositioned as the future leader of the clan, I was never\nconsulted on the choice to go by the name of Ayt. In truth, I’ve\nnever felt any personal connection to that name.”\nNiko nodded. He glanced toward the study, but Shae could\nsee his reluctance to go into that room. Hilo had been the same\nway at first, when it had still felt wrong to sit in Lan’s space.\n“Would you like to walk outside, Koben-jen?”\nOut in the garden, the damp chill of approaching winter\nwas in the air, and the late season chrysanthemums were in full\nbloom. Slim, wind-plucked petals of white, red, and gold\nfloated atop the still pond. Niko glanced at Shae, wordlessly\nasking his Weather Man to accompany him as they took\nKoben Ato along the pebbled path around the grounds. She did\nso at a slight distance, close enough to hear the conversation,\nbut not so close as to join it. She didn’t feel capable of talking\nto anyone, not yet. At times, she felt Niko was doing a better\njob of shouldering his new role as Pillar than she was in\noccupying her old one as Weather Man.\n“I must be the first person in the Mountain clan to receive\na personal tour of the Kaul estate,” Ato said. “It’s as nice as I\nimagined.”\n“I haven’t been to the Ayt residence myself,” Niko said,\n“but I’ve heard it’s equally impressive.” It was a strange sight,\nthe two young Pillars strolling through the garden together,\nNiko casually pointing out this and that about the houses and\nthe landscaping as Ato nodded in appreciation. It was nothing\nlike a proper meeting of clan leaders, but perhaps it was what\nwas needed in the moment. Their first attempt had ended in\nunfathomable tragedy; this was something else.\nAt last, they circled back to where they had begun, in the\ncourtyard of the main house. Ato turned to face the other\nPillar. “Kaul-jen,” he said, “I’m sincerely sorry for your loss.\nYour uncle was always a ruthless enemy of my clan, but no\none can dispute that he was a great Green Bone warrior. That\nday, he saved my life and lost his own.”\n“I’m sorry for the losses on your side as well.” Niko didn’t\nsay more. Shae thought perhaps he should’ve, but either he\ncouldn’t make himself talk about that day more than necessary,\nor he was deliberately holding back, waiting to hear what the\nother man had to say. Perhaps both. His expression gave\nnothing away, and Shae suspected that his jade aura didn’t\neither.\nAto said, “I’m sure you already know that Iwe Kalundo\ntook his own life.

Ayt Mada has been stripped of jade and\nconfined in a secret location, under guard by Green Bones\nloyal to my family, for her protection as well as ours.” Ato’s\nface moved in a brief, involuntary contortion. “The Mountain\nis in a state of shock and disarray. I’m afraid it’s broken\nsomewhere deep inside. At this point, I’m not sure what will\nbecome of the clan and whether it’s even worth saving.”\nIt was an astonishing statement to make. Who could ever\nrecall any Pillar uttering such a thing? What Green Bone\nleader would admit he’d lost control of his own warriors,\nfailed to maintain authority over his clan?\nPerhaps, however, Koben Ato was simply tired of denying\nwhat was becoming increasingly obvious to everyone. The\nMountain clan was riven. Although most of its members\ncondemned Ayt Mada’s shocking attempted coup, they did not\nnecessarily flock enthusiastically to support the Kobens, who\nwere seen by some as imprudent and divisive. Ato, for all his\nyears in the public eye, had not been given much latitude by\nhis Pillar, and thus did not have many personal\naccomplishments to suggest he was a strong and visionary\nenough leader to command widespread loyalty and rebuild the\nclan’s tarnished image in the wake of so much accumulated\nshame and carnage.\nMany of the Mountain’s Lantern Men and tributary minor\nclans, disenchanted by the constant infighting and no longer\nfearful of Ayt Mada or the Kobens, were continuing to steadily\ndefect to No Peak. A few families in the Mountain were\nbreaking off entirely and forming their own independent minor\nclans. Local offshoots of the barukan gangs were recruiting the\nMountain’s Keko-Shotarian members. A faction of Ayt Mada’s\nmost die-hard loyalists had left Janloon and regrouped in\nGohei, where they were reportedly forming their own small\nclan, the Spear Carrier clan, claiming spiritual lineage to Ayt\nYu and his daughter Mada.\nKoben Ato’s face tightened in a weary grimace. “Ever\nsince I was a boy, I’ve been used like a chess piece. My\nrelatives expected me to be the shining heir to Ayt Yugontin, to\nlift up the whole family. My aunt Mada named me her ward to\nsecure their support and to keep her detractors in line, but she\nnever showed me love or considered me worthy. The media\nand the public were always watching. I was told what to say,\nhow to dress, who to marry, who to be friends and enemies\nwith, and sometimes even those demands were conflicting.”\nAto made no attempt to hide his envy as he looked into\nNiko’s face. “I know you felt the pressure of a similar position,\nand I was jealous when you rebelled and left the country. But\nI’m not sure you saw what seemed apparent to me—for all his\nfaults, your uncle did his best to surround you with his\nstrength, rather than pushing you out front like a sacrifice. All\nof my greatest suffering has come from within my own clan.”\nAto turned his face away and silence stretched between the"

All\nof my greatest suffering has come from within my own clan.”\nAto turned his face away and silence stretched between the\ntwo men. They carried a long and terrible legacy between\nthem, but they were young and trying to change things. Ato\nsaid, “I can’t execute my own aunt. She whispered my name,\nand she deserves to die, but she sponsored and trained me. If I\nhave her killed, I’ll be continuing the cycle she began when\nshe murdered her brother—my father, who I barely remember.\nShe sent a message to the entire clan that personal ties mean\nnothing. Strength is all that matters and any action can be\njustified. Under her rule, the Mountain grew ever larger and\nmore powerful, but vicious and dysfunctional.”\nNiko said, “Maybe you can take what’s left and build\nsomething better.”\n“Maybe,” Ato conceded. “It’ll take time, but I’ll try.”\nSeeing the two Pillars standing together, lines already\nstamped across their young features, Shae tilted her face\ntoward the sun, closing her eyes for a moment against the\nburning tightness in her chest—sadness and pity jumbled with\npride and hope. She wasn’t done yet; she had to help Niko as\nshe’d promised she would—but with that final step, she could\nlay down the burden she and her brothers had carried across a\ncanyon that had so often seemed impassable.\nHilo. Lan, Shae whispered in her mind, can you see this,\nfrom wherever you are? We did it at last. We kept our clan. We\nmade it stronger and passed it on.\nI miss you both.\nAto turned back to Niko, but his eyes settled upon Shae.\n“Your family has suffered more from Ayt Mada than mine.\nWhatever justice she gets should come from you, not from me.\nKaul Hiloshudon was my enemy, but I owe him my life, so it’s\nonly right that I repay that debt. I’m handing Ayt Mada over to\nthe Kaul family. I beg that you accept this as a gesture of\nrepentance and goodwill.”\nNiko did not respond at first. Then he nodded slowly.\nAto said, “In return, I ask that No Peak consider its blood\ndebt paid and that you not take any additional vengeance on\nthe Mountain clan. It seems clear by now that Ayt and Iwe\nacted alone in their scheme. Reigniting hostilities between our\nclans would empower the small faction of Ayt’s old guard that\nremains.”\nNiko exchanged a mute glance with Shae. Then he turned\nback to Ato. “You have my word as Pillar, under Heaven and\non jade. The old hatreds—they’re over with.”\nKoben Ato nodded in gratitude. “My aunt was right all\nalong. I’m not a strong Pillar and could never be her heir. But\nmaybe we’ve had enough of those types of people. Whatever\nhappens after this—whether the Mountain survives, whether I\nremain Pillar—No Peak will be the largest and most powerful\nGreen Bone clan in the country. It will be up to you, to be a\nPillar for all of Kekon. I know I should feel defeated, but\nmostly, I feel relieved.”"

I know I should feel defeated, but\nmostly, I feel relieved.”\nHe touched his clasped hands to his forehead and tilted\nforward in salute. “Far do your enemies flee, Kaul-jen, and\nmay the gods shine favor on No Peak.”\nCHAPTER\n63\nRemembrance\nthe third month\nD\nr. Emery Anden won the seat in the Royal Council for\nJanloon Central—including Sogen, Old Town, Sotto Village,\nand North Sotto—by a comfortable margin. Much\ncommentary was made of the fact that he was the first known\nqueer candidate elected to national government, only the third\ncouncilman of mixed race, and the first member of the Kaul\nfamily to ever serve in public office. Although the victory was\ncelebrated, it was not surprising given his advantages. He had\nthe sponsorship of the No Peak clan, credentials as an\naccomplished doctor with international experience, and a\nreputation as a clan loyalist and a man who was green in the\nsoul.\nAnden found it ironic that what had once been a\ndisgraceful blemish on his past—refusing jade at his\ngraduation from Kaul Dushuron Academy and leaving the\ncountry in exile for some time as a consequence—was now\ncited as evidence of his upstanding moral character at a young\nage. Voters apparently admired the way that, given his\nmother’s tragic death from the Itches, he’d turned away from\nviolence and shine use despite prodigious jade abilities and\nsevere pressure from family and society. Anden sometimes\nwished he could travel back in time to reassure his eighteen-\nyear-old self that he would find his own way after all—but\nthen again, it would’ve been cruel, at that age, to learn of all\nthe other struggles and sorrows that were still to come.\nEarly on a cool but sunny Seventhday morning, the day\nbefore he was to be sworn into office, Anden walked into a\nsmall, secondstory apartment in an unremarkable building in\nLittle Hammer. He passed three guards along the way,\nMountain Green Bones loyal to the Koben family—one posted\nat the building’s entrance, one outside the door to the\napartment, one inside the small unit itself. They recognized\nAnden of course—who else could he be?—and when he\nproduced the letter from Kaul Nikoyan, Pillar of No Peak,\nbearing the insignia of the clan, the guard at the door\ngrumbled, “About time,” and let him enter.\nAyt Madashi sat cross-legged on the only sofa in the\napartment, watching the news on a small television. Anden\nwas shocked by her appearance. Ayt’s undyed hair was coarse\nand gray and she was hunched, as if she were very cold, inside\na baggy turtleneck sweater with long sleeves that drooped all\nthe way to her fingers. Anden had never seen Ayt with her\narms covered. He knew that beneath the bulky fabric, they\nwere bare. The silver coils of mounted jade that Ayt had worn\nand proudly displayed for so many years were gone.

After\nsurrendering herself to Koben’s people and ordering her\nloyalists not to fight, she’d been stripped of her jade and\nconfined under house arrest in this unknown safe house.\nAlthough she’d made it through the ordeal of jade withdrawal,\nAnden could not help but marvel at how much less she seemed\nto be. One of the most formidable Green Bones of her\ngeneration—now a weary, thin, jadeless, sixty-six-yearold\nwoman.\nAyt switched off the television and turned her head toward\nAnden. Seeing the pity in his expression, her mouth flattened\ninto a line and some of the old fire flared in her eyes, a flash of\nthe ruthless iron will that had been the bane of the No Peak\nclan for decades.\n“Are you surprised to find me still here, Emery Anden?”\nAyt asked, a touch sardonically. “Perhaps you thought I’d\nfollow Iwe’s example?”\n“The thought occurred to me,” Anden admitted.\n“As it did to me.” Ayt’s shoulders slackened. “But I seem\nincapable of taking the easy route in anything. Survival is a\nhabit, it seems, one that’s hard to break.”\n“So is jade,” Anden said, looking steadily at her. “So is\npower.”\nAyt uncrossed her legs and set her feet down but didn’t rise\nfrom her seat. “Koben Ato hasn’t come. Not that I expected\nhim to. He always was a coward who shrank from tough\ndecisions, letting others make choices for him. Even knowing\nthat I whispered his name, he would rather avoid the\ndistasteful problem of executing his own aunt by foisting the\ntask onto No Peak.” She sounded disappointed and regretful,\nas if she wished she’d been proven wrong in her assessment of\nthe young man who she’d attempted to have killed. Ayt\nnarrowed her eyes at Anden. “However, I’m surprised your\nnephew waited so long. It’s been three very dull months. I\nwould’ve thought the new Pillar of No Peak was greener than\nthat.”\n“If it were up to some members of the clan, you would’ve\nalready been publicly executed, beheaded, and buried without\na grave,” Anden said. “But Kaul Niko wanted to wait until\nafter the dust settled, after the elections and the holiday\nseason, when people would’ve stopped thinking about you.”\nAyt looked past Anden, as if expecting to see other people\nbehind him, but there was no one else. “And then he sends you\nalone. He won’t even face me.”\nAnden said, “You’re nothing to him, just a defeated enemy.\nHe’s not like other Green Bones in that way. You’re\nresponsible for the death of his father—fathers, the one by\nblood, and the one who raised him—but he doesn’t care for\npersonal vengeance and won’t let it determine his decisions.\nHe doesn’t want to see you or speak to you. He only wants\nyou gone.”\n“So you’re here,” Ayt said. “Dr. Emery. I should say,\nCouncilman Emery. To speak for the No Peak clan and deliver\nthe justice of the Kaul family.”\n“I am,” Anden said."

After\nall her efforts, I deceived her. I put both of her brothers in the\nground. Why isn’t she here?”\n“She told me she has nothing else to say to you,” Anden\nanswered. “She spared your life once, and she says that’s all\nthe gods can ask of her in this lifetime.”\nAnden handed Ayt the letter he had brought with him,\nwritten in Niko’s hand. Having read it, he knew it was short\nand impersonal, explaining the details of the decision without\nany personal comment. A copy of it had been sent to Koben\nAto.\n“You’re to be exiled from Kekon,” Anden explained to\nAyt. “You’ll live out the rest of your days in Ygutan.\nArrangements have been made to transport you to a small oil\ntown in the north that’s supposed to be quite dull. Jade is still\nillegal in that country, and there’s none of it within hundreds\nof kilometers of that place.”\nColor rose slowly in Ayt’s face and the pages of the letter\ntrembled in her tightening grip. “Why?” she demanded. “Why\nthe pointless mercy? Why not execute me properly?”\n“There’s no gain in it,” Anden explained. “You’re a\njadeless old woman now. Killing you would look bad, no\nmatter how much you deserve it. You were a powerful leader\nnot only of the Mountain clan, but the country. Surely, there\nare people out there who are still sympathetic toward you.\nWhy make you into a martyr, why give you that last\nsatisfaction and risk more strife when we’re turning over a\nnew leaf with the Kobens and taking the remnants of the\nMountain as tributaries?” Anden opened his hands. “At least,\nthat’s what the Pillar thinks.”\nIt was the first real decision that Kaul Nikoyan had made\nas Pillar, after talking to Anden, Shae, and Lott, then quietly\nconsidering the issue himself for several weeks. If the careful,\ndispassionate way he had come to his conclusion was\nindicative of the type of Pillar he would be, Anden was certain\nhis nephew would turn out to be a formidable Green Bone\nleader in his own way.\nAyt’s sneer pulled back the corners of her eyes and seemed\nalmost physically painful. She looked as if she wanted to laugh\nor kill someone, and for a moment, she was frightening again.\n“I can’t believe I would ever miss Kaul Hiloshudon.”\nAnden said, “You’ll have two more days in Janloon to\npack the personal belongings you need, and to visit your\nfamily’s grave, if you wish. Should you change your mind\nduring that time and decide to follow Iwe’s path after all, none\nof the guards will stand in your way. If you accept your exile\nand never make another attempt to gain jade, return to\nJanloon, or affect the course of Green Bone matters, after your\ndeath you’ll be brought back to Kekon and buried in the Ayt\nfamily plot.

If you break the terms, your name will be quietly\nwhispered by every clan, and your bones will never touch\nKekonese soil.”\nAyt’s proud bearing crumpled bit by bit as Anden spoke.\nThe indignant scorn she’d mustered for a few minutes\ndissolved into exhaustion, as if a mask she’d worn for her\nentire life was slipping off, revealing a person underneath that\nAnden had never seen before, not even when she’d lain near\ndeath in his apartment. Ayt looked sad, more deeply sad than\nAnden could’ve imagined.\n“Tell your Pillar that he has nothing more to worry about\nfrom me,” she said, when he was done. There was no more\nanger or vindictiveness in her voice, only a factual defeat.\nDignity if not grace. “I’ve given everything I have, and I have\nnothing left. I know my time has passed.”\nAyt turned to gaze out the narrow window of the tiny\napartment, over the bit of the city she could see. The sunlight\nslanting into the room cut a line across the carpet and lit\ndancing motes of dust in the air. Noises from the street below\n—the rumble of a bus, a bicycle horn, something heavy being\ntossed into a garbage bin—intruded faintly. None of the people\ngoing about their day outside had any idea that the woman\nwho’d been Pillar of the Mountain sat in a small room above\nthem, listening.\n“Many years ago, when I saw what was happening around\nus, I imagined a bold and necessary future,” Ayt said. “Green\nBones united into a single powerful clan, wielding control\nover our jade and standing strong over Kekon, preserving our\ntraditions and protecting us from enemies across the ocean as\nwell as those here at home. It was up to us, as jade warriors, to\nmeet all the threats and opportunities that time would\ninevitably bring to our door.”\nAyt pulled her sweater close but lifted her chin, as if facing\na crowd waiting for her to speak. “Everything I’ve done, every\ngreat and terrible choice I’ve made over many years, every bit\nof normal human happiness I sacrificed from my own life, I\ndid willingly and purposefully, to see this future.

People were\nsweeping the burnt remnants of firecrackers off the streets and\nstanding on ladders, taking down New Year’s decorations.\nSome businesses in Little Hammer still had pale green lanterns\nin their front windows, but others had changed over to white,\nand a few windows were empty, their owners undecided,\nwaiting to see how territorial jurisdictions would shake out.\nWhen he crossed into the Armpit, two of the clan’s Fingers\nposted along the district border touched their foreheads and\ndipped into shallow salutes of recognition as he passed.\nAnden stopped on the street corner and raised his face to\nthe sky. He felt heavy and light at the same time, and the world\nseemed sharp and beautiful even in a way that jade senses\ncould not improve. There was an ache in his chest—some of\nthe grief that had been arriving in pieces—but also relief, and\nlove. Love for the life pumping through his heart and veins,\nlove for those dear to him—the ones who were gone and the\nones who remained, and love also for his city, for Janloon—a\nplace as fierce and honest, as messy and proud and enduring as\nits Green Bone warriors.\nAnden hailed a taxi. When it pulled up to the curb, he got\ninto the back seat and said, “The Twice Lucky restaurant.”\nThe driver looked at Anden in the rearview mirror. He was\na sallow, unsmiling man with a crooked face that made the\nskin around one of his eyes sag. “That old place in the\nDocks?”\n“That’s the one,” Anden said.\nThe driver hesitated. He looked as if he wanted to say\nsomething, then he pulled the cab away from the sidewalk and\ninto traffic. “I can’t believe that place is still around,” he\ngrumbled, flicking another glance back at Anden. “There are\nbetter spots, you know.”\n“It’s an old favorite,” Anden said.\n“The only reason it’s still there is because it’s been around\nso long,” sniffed the cab driver. “I heard it was headed\ndownhill, but then the Une family hired some young,\ninternationally renowned chef up from Lukang to change\nthings, so it’s got a new look. It’s survived enough wars by\nnow that I guess nothing can take it down.”\nThe light turned red. The driver stopped the cab and turned\nover his shoulder. “I used to work there once, you know. As a\ndishwasher. A long time ago. I was just a kid back then. A\ndumb kid with big dreams.”\nAnden said, “We were all like that once.”\n“Yeah, well, my life could’ve been different. Real\ndifferent.” The light turned green and the driver turned back\naround and took his foot off the brake. “Of course, I could be\ndead, so there’s that.” He laughed. It was an unpleasant sound."

These books wouldn’t\nhave found their audience without you.\nThank you to all the folks at Orbit: my first editor there,\nSarah Guan, who brought the series in and gave it a running\nstart, and my new editor, Nivia Evans, who came in to push it\nover the finish line. My thanks to marketing and publicity\ngurus Ellen Wright, Paola Crespo, Angela Man, and Stephanie\nHess, the UK team including Jenni Hill and Nazia Khatun,\nproduction editor Rachel Goldstein, cover designer Lisa Marie\nPompilio, copyeditor extraordinaire Kelley Frodel, and\neveryone else who helped to shepherd this book into the world\nin fine form.\nI’m deeply fortunate that my stalwart agent, Jim\nMcCarthy, has believed in my work and had my back since the\nstart of my career.

Around\nher, pale Balladairan-born sailors scrambled across the ship to\nbring it safely to harbor.\nEl-Wast, for the first time in some twenty-odd years. It\ntook the air from the lieutenant’s chest. Her white-knuckle grip\non the rail was only partly due to the nausea that had rocked\nher on the water.\n“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Tibeau, Touraine’s second\nsergeant and best friend, settled against the rail next to her.\nThe wooden rail shifted under his bulk. He spoke quietly, but\nTouraine could hear the awe and longing in the soft rumble of\nhis voice.\nBeautiful wasn’t the first thing Touraine thought as their\nship sailed up the mouth of the River Hadd and gave them a\nview of El-Wast. The city was surprisingly big. Surprisingly\nbright. It was surprisingly … civilized. A proper city, not some\nscattering of tents and sand. Not what she had expected at all,\ngiven how Balladairans described the desert colonies. From\nthis angle, it didn’t even look like a desert.\nThe docks stretched along the river like a small town, short\nbuildings nestled alongside what were probably warehouses\nand workers’ tenements. Just beyond them, a massive bridge\narced over shadowed farmland with some crop growing in neat\nrows, connecting the docks to the curve of a crumbling wall\nthat surrounded the city. The Mile-Long Bridge. The great\nbridge was lined with the shadows of palm trees and lit up all\nalong with the fuzzy dots of lanterns. In the morning darkness,\nyou could easily have mistaken the lanterns for stars.\nShe shrugged. “It’s impressive, I guess.”\nTibeau nudged her shoulder and held his arms out wide to\ntake it all in. “You guess? This is your home. We’re finally\nback. You’re going to love it.” His eyes shone in the reflection\nof the lanterns guiding the Balladairan ship into Crocodile\nHarbor, named for the monstrous lizards that had supposedly\nlived in the river centuries ago.\nHome. Touraine frowned. “Love it? Beau, we’re not on\nleave.” She dug half-moons into the soft, weather-worn wood\nof the railing and grumbled, “We have a job to do.”\nTibeau scoffed. “To police our own people.”\nThe thunk of approaching boots on the deck behind them\nstopped Touraine from saying something that would keep\nTibeau from speaking to her for the rest of the day. Something\nlike These aren’t my people. How could they be? Touraine had\nbarely been toddling in the dust when Balladaire took her.\n“You two better not be talking about what I think you’re\ntalking about,” Sergeant Pruett said, coming up behind them\nwith her arms crossed.\n“Of course not,” Touraine said. She and Pruett let their\nknuckles brush in the cover of darkness.\n“Good. Because I’d hate to have to throw you bearfuckers\noverboard.”\nPruett.

The only thing they agreed on was hating\nBalladaire for what it had done to them, but unlike Tibeau,\nwho was only biding his time before some imaginary\nrevolution, Pruett was resigned to the conscripts’ fate and\nthought it better to keep their heads down and hate Balladaire\nin private.\nPruett shoved her way between the two of them and\npropped her elbows on the railing. Her teeth chattered. “It’s\ncold as a bastard here. I thought the deserts were supposed to\nbe hot.”\nTibeau sighed wistfully, staring with longing at some point\nbeyond the city. “Only during the day. In the real desert, you\ncan freeze your balls off if you forget a blanket.”\n“You sound … oddly excited about that.” Pruett looked\naskance at him.\nTibeau grinned.\nHome was a sharp topic for every soldier in the\nBalladairan Colonial Brigade. There were those like Tibeau\nand Pruett, who had been taken from countries throughout the\nbroken Shālan Empire when they were old enough to already\nhave memories of family or the lack thereof, and then there\nwere those like Touraine, who had been too young to\nremember anything but Balladaire’s green fields and thick\nforests.\nNo matter where in the Shālan Empire the conscripts were\noriginally from, they all speculated on the purpose of their new\npost. There was excitement on the wind, and Touraine felt it,\ntoo. The chance to prove herself. The chance to show the\nBalladairan officers that she deserved to be a captain. Change\nwas coming.\nEven the Balladairan princess had come with the fleet.\nPruett had heard from another conscript who had it from a\nsailor that the princess was visiting her southern colonies for\nthe first time, and so the conscripts took turns trying to spot\nthe young royal on her ship.\nThe order came to disembark, carried by shouts on the\nwind. Discipline temporarily disappeared as the conscripts and\ntheir Balladairan officers hoisted their packs and tramped\ndown to Crocodile Harbor’s thronged streets.\nPeople shouted in Balladairan and Shālan as they loaded\nand unloaded ships, animals in cages and animals on leads\nsquawked and bellowed, and Touraine walked through it all in\na daze, trying to take it in. Qazāl’s dirt and grit crunched\nbeneath her army-issued boots. Maybe she did feel a spark of\nawe and curiosity. And maybe that frightened her just a little.\nWith a wumph, Touraine walked right into an odd tan\nhorse with a massive hump in the middle of its back. She spat\nand dusted coarse fur off her face. The animal glared at her\nwith large, affronted brown eyes and a bubble of spit forming\nat the corner of its mouth.\nThe animal’s master flicked his long grays-treaked hair\nback off his smiling face and spoke to Touraine in Shālan.\nTouraine hadn’t spoken Shālan since she was small. It\nwasn’t allowed when they were children in Balladaire, and\nnow it sounded as foreign as the camel’s groan. She shook her\nhead."

She shook her\nhead.\n“Camel. He spit,” the man warned, this time in\nBalladairan. The camel continued to size her up. It didn’t look\nlike it was coming to any good conclusion.\nTouraine grimaced in disgust, but beside her, Pruett\nsnorted. The other woman said something short to the man in\nShālan before turning Touraine toward the ships.\n“What did you say?” Touraine asked, looking over her\nshoulder at the glaring camel and the older man.\n“‘Please excuse my idiot friend.’”\nTouraine rolled her eyes and hefted her pack higher onto\nher shoulders.\n“Rose Company, Gold Squad, form up on me!” She tried\nin vain to gather her soldiers in some kind of order, but the\nnoise swallowed her voice. She looked warily for Captain\nRogan. If Touraine didn’t get the rest of her squad in line, that\nbastard would take it out on all of them. “Gold Squad, form\nup!”\nPruett nudged Touraine in the ribs. She pointed, and\nTouraine saw what kept her soldiers clumped in whispering\ngroups, out of formation.\nA young woman descended the gangway of another ship\nwith the support of a cane. She wore black trousers, a black\ncoat, and a short black cloak lined with cloth of gold. Her\nblond hair, pinned in a bun behind her head, sparked like a\nbeacon in the night. Three stone-faced royal guards\naccompanied her in a protective triangle, their short gold\ncloaks blown taut behind them. Each of them had a sword on\none hip and a pistol on the other.\nTouraine looked from the princess to the chaos on the\nground, and a growing sense of unease raised the short hairs\non the back of her neck. Suddenly, the crowd felt more\nclaustrophobic than industrious.\nThe man with the camel still stood nearby, watching with\ninterest like the other dockworkers. His warm smile deepened\nthe lines in his face, and he guided the animal’s nose to her, as\nif she wanted to pat it. The camel looked as unenthusiastic at\nthe prospect as Touraine felt.\n“No.” Touraine shook her head at him again. “Move, sir.\nGive us this space, if you please.”\nHe didn’t move. Probably didn’t understand proper\nBalladairan. She shooed him with her hands. Instead of\nreacting with annoyance or confusion, he glanced fearfully\nover her shoulder.\nShe followed his gaze. Nothing there but the press of the\ncrowd, her own soldiers either watching the princess or\ndrowsily taking in their new surroundings in the early-morning\nlight. Then she saw it: a young Qazāli woman weaving\nthrough the crowd, gaze fixed on one blond point.\nThe camel man grabbed Touraine’s arm, and she jerked\naway.\nTouraine was a good soldier, and a good soldier would do\nher duty. She didn’t let herself imagine what the consequences\nwould be if she was wrong.\n“Attack!” she bellowed, fit for a battlefield. “To the\nprincess!”"

A warning to his fellow. To\nmore of them, maybe. Something glinted in his hands.\nTouraine spared only half a glance toward the princess.\nThat was what the royal guard was for. Instead, she launched\ntoward the camel man, dropping her pack instead of swinging\nit at him. Stupid, stupid. Instinct alone saved her life. She lifted\nher arms just in time to get a slice across her left forearm\ninstead of her throat.\nShe drew her baton to counterattack, but instead of running\nin the scant moment he had, the old man hesitated, squinting at\nher.\n“Wait,” he said. “You look familiar.” His Balladairan was\nsuddenly more than adequate.\nTouraine shook off his words, knocked the knife from his\nhand, and tripped him to the ground. He struggled against her\nwith wiry strength until she pinned the baton against his throat.\nThat kept him from saying anything else. She held him there,\nher teeth bared and his eyes wide while he strained for breath.\nBehind her, the camel man’s companions clashed with the\nother soldiers. A young woman’s highpitched cry. The\nprincess or the assassin?\nThe old man rasped against the pressure of the baton.\n“Wait,” he started, but Touraine pressed harder until he lost the\nwords.\nThen the docks went silent. The rest of the attackers had\nbeen taken down, dead or apprehended. The man beneath her\nrealized it, too, and all the fight sagged out of him.\nWhen they relieved her, she stood to find herself\nsurrounded. The three royal guards, alert, swords drawn; a\nhandful of fancy-looking if spooked civilians; the general—\nher general. General Cantic. And, of course, the princess.\nHeat rose to her face. Touraine knew that some part of her\nshould be afraid of overstepping; she’d just shat on all the\nrules and decorum that had been drilled into the conscripts for\ntwo decades. But the highest duty was to the throne of\nBalladaire, and not everyone could say they had stopped an\nassassination. Even if Touraine was a conscript, she couldn’t\nbe punished for that. She hoped. She settled into the strength\nof her broad shoulders and bowed deeply to the princess.\n“I’m sorry to disturb you, Your Highness,” Touraine said,\nher voice smooth and low.\nThe princess quirked an eyebrow. “Thank you”—the\nprincess looked to the double wheat-stalk pins on Touraine’s\ncollar—“Lieutenant …?”\n“Lieutenant Touraine, Your Highness.” Touraine bowed\nagain. She peeked at the general out of the corner of her eye,\nbut the older woman’s lined face was unreadable.\n“Thank you, Lieutenant Touraine, for your quick\nthinking.”\nA small shuffling to the side admitted a horse-faced man\nwith a dark brown tail of hair under his bicorne hat.

Captain\nRogan sneered over Touraine before bowing to the princess.\n“Your Highness, I apologize if this Sand has\ninconvenienced you.” Before the princess could respond,\nRogan turned to Touraine and spat, “Get back to your squad.\nForm them up like they should have been.”\nSo much for taking her chance to rise. So much for duty.\nTouraine sucked her teeth and saluted. “Yes, sir.”\nShe tightened her sleeve against the bleeding cut on her\nleft arm and went back to her squad, who stood in a tight\nclump a few yards away from the old man’s camel. The beast\nhuffed with a sound like a bubbling kettle, and a disdainful\nglob of foamy spittle dripped from its slack lips. Safe enough\nto say she had made an impression on the locals.\nAnd the others? Touraine looked back for another glimpse\nat the princess and found the other woman meeting her gaze.\nTouraine tugged the bill of her field cap and nodded before\nturning away, attempting to appear as unruffled as she could.\nWhen Touraine returned to her squad, Pruett looked\nuncertain as Rogan handed the older man off to another\nofficer, who led him and the young woman away. “I told you\nto be careful about attracting attention.”\nTouraine smiled, even though her arm stung and blood\nleaked into her palm. “Attention’s not bad if you’re the hero.”\nThat did make Pruett laugh. “Ha! Hero. A Sand? I guess\nyou think the princess wants to wear my shit for perfume,\ntoo.”\nTouraine laughed back, and it was tinged with the same\nfrustration and bitterness that talk of their place in the world\nalways was.\nThis time, when she called for her squad to form up, they\ndid. Gold Squad and the others pulled down their field caps\nand drew close their coats. The wind was picking up. The sun\nwas rising. The Qazāli dockworkers bent their backs into their\nwork again, but occasionally they glanced—nervous, scared,\nsuspicious, hateful—at the conscripts. At Rogan’s order, she\nand the conscripts marched to their new posts.\nChange was coming. Touraine aimed to be on the right\nside of it.\nCHAPTER 2\nA HOMECOMING\nA ea storm, the Balladairans in Qazāl called it, because\ngrains of sand lodged in every improbable place on a\nbody, climbing into buttoned jackets and nestling into cropped\nhair, whistling itchy fury into every home and guardhouse, no\nmatter how tight the curtains were shut or how low a soldier\ntugged their field cap. It cast everything in brown shadow.\nTouraine pulled her cap lower as the storm yanked at her\nblack uniform coat while she and the other Balladairan\nColonial conscripts stood at attention in the bazaar. Their faces\nwere neutral, but Sergeant Pruett scanned the crowd. Sergeant\nTibeau kept his eyes locked obediently forward, but he was\nprobably contemplating every anti-Balladairan feeling he’d\never had.

When the order had come for Touraine’s squad to\nmuster in the city’s largest bazaar, a plaza lined with merchant\nstalls, the storm had become more than just a dark imagining\non the edge of the horizon.\nSand skittered like dry rain against the wooden gallows in\nthe center of the square. It flayed the Qazāli prisoners Touraine\nand Pruett had caught just this morning, ripping into their bare\nchests while they stood parched and peeling in the sun. It\ntaunted Touraine and her squad, just like the Balladairans who\ncalled the desert-born conscripts “Sands.”\nWithin the square of a horse-mounted guard, the\nBalladairan princess shifted uncomfortably on horseback, eyes\ndarting between the prisoners and the Qazāli civilians in the\ncrowd. She didn’t look nearly as confident as she had after the\nthwarted assassination this morning.\nOnly the Qazāli took the sand with equanimity, their bright\nhoods raised and sand veils or scarves wrapped to protect\nagainst the dust’s assault.\nAs the Balladairan captain of Touraine’s company strutted\ntoward her, Touraine willed the scowl off her face, if only for\nthe sake of the general at his side. Captain Rogan kept his\nbicorne hat low on his head to keep the wind at bay, preening\nand bowing toward anyone of higher rank. The general only\nducked her head a little under the wind.\n“Lieutenant Touraine. You’ve done well for yourself since\nI last saw you.” General Cantic smiled, and Touraine’s mouth\nwent dry. “We have you to thank for this.” The general nodded\ntoward the prisoners awaiting their fates.\n“General Cantic is giving you the hanging. I trust you\nwon’t botch it?” Rogan slipped in, trying to undermine\nTouraine immediately. His clipped, aristocratic accent curled\nTouraine’s lip by reflex. His blue eyes were cold and his nose\nshort and sharp, good for looking down. He thrust the\nprisoners’ chain at her.\nThe wind blew hard enough to snap the nooses like whips.\n“Of course, sir.” Touraine chose to speak directly to the\ngeneral.\n“Excellent,” Cantic said. “Move along. The weather’s\nturning.”\nTouraine glanced at the sky and regretted it as stray\ngranules of dust lodged in her eyes. She had been relieved to\nscuff dry land under her boots this morning, had never wanted\nto see another ship again. Now she wanted to get back on that\nwooden catastrophe and vomit her way back to Balladaire. So\nwhat if she had been born in this sand-fucked city? It was too\nlong ago for her to remember, and she could see why she’d\nnever missed it.\nStill. The Qazāli rebels drew Touraine’s eyes like a\nlodestone, and they squinted and scowled right back.

The prisoners must have stood there\nall day, maybe since their capture. If they hadn’t been\nquestioned first. The sun rose slowly, peeking over the\nbuildings to the other side of the river, the ruins of an old city,\nout of the storm’s reach. The chain was heavy and warm in\nTouraine’s hand.\nThe pale Balladairan soldiers stood poised at attention,\ntheir musket butts digging into the earth. They formed another\nbuffer between the princess on her horse and the restless\nQazāli in the square. Touraine’s attention, however, was\nprimarily with the general. Ultimately, only General Cantic\nhad the power to promote her, but maybe the princess would\nbe grateful enough to commend her.\nCantic and a squat, official-looking woman walked up the\nwooden stairs, and Touraine followed, leading the prisoners by\nthe chain. She gestured for Pruett to follow. From the new\nvantage point, she could see the tops of the clay buildings\nwhose walls formed the edges of the bazaar, outlined against\nthe approaching storm. Fine, maybe Tibeau was right. It was a\nlittle breathtaking.\nSergeant Pruett yanked each prisoner into position behind\na noose. She nodded to Touraine, her eyes half-lidded, looking\nmore sullen than usual. The russet-brown curls poking from\nher field cap were plastered darkly to the sides of her skull\nwith sweat. Then she stepped back to wait next to the lever\nthat would drop the rebels to their deaths. Touraine waited for\nher own cue on the other end of the platform.\nThe kick of Cantic’s boots on the gallows platform killed\nthe rumble of conversation. Time had made her even more\nsevere. Her hair, which had grown more white than blond\nsince Touraine had last seen her, was pulled back into a tight\ntail under her tricorne. Her hand rested on the pommel of her\nsaber, and her broad shoulders were bonier but straight,\ndespite the approaching wall of sand.\nA woman worth studying, worth pleasing, worth staying\nclose to. Touraine had been thrilled to learn she would be\nstationed at Cantic’s base. Supposedly, the general had been\nexpanding and protecting the desert colonies for years.\nThe other woman was less severe, but she cocked her head\nat Touraine and the other Sands in curiosity. She wasn’t in an\nofficer’s uniform, which meant she had to be a government\nofficial. The governor. Touraine returned her focus to the\ngeneral, like everyone else in the square.\nIn a commanding voice that echoed across the square,\nGeneral Cantic said something in Shālan, the language of the\nbroken southern empire. The words sounded like rocks rattling\nin a cup, and they caught everyone’s attention. Touraine didn’t\nknow what they meant. Like everything else Touraine had\ntaken from Qazāl when she was a kid, the language had been\nculled out of her."

Like everything else Touraine had\ntaken from Qazāl when she was a kid, the language had been\nculled out of her.\nCantic continued in Balladairan. “Citizens, today we\ncelebrate. Though the occasion is grim, justice has won a\ndecisive victory.” She gestured to the prisoners behind her\nwith an open palm. “These rebels are guilty of attempted\nmurder.”\nTouraine’s eyes drifted back to the princess. She’d\ndismounted. Smart not to provide a raised target for more rebel\nassassins. The people who weren’t looking at the condemned\nsnuck glances at Her Highness. The heir to the Balladairan\nthrone seemed small and fragile on the ground, surrounded for\nher own protection.\n“With the help of the Qazāli magistrate, we have spoken\nwith the prisoners”—there was no doubt what spoken with\nmeant—“and we will find the other rebels involved. Anyone\nfound aiding them or feeding them or sheltering them will die\nwith them. However.” General Cantic softened her tone\nmarginally. “What is justice if it is not upheld by the law and\nthe people? If you have any information about the rebel\nleaders, come to us. You will receive amnesty, a handsome\nreward, and gratitude for your dedication to our alliance.”\nThe spectators craned their necks to see them: Touraine\nand Pruett, the general, the prisoners. Touraine and the Sands\nwere an unspoken lecture: she was born Qazāli, but Balladaire\nhad educated her, trained her to fight, fed her, kept her healthy.\nShe had grown up civilized. The Qazāli could do much worse\nthan cooperate.\nGeneral Cantic gave Touraine an encouraging nod.\nThe first of the condemned was a dark man with salt-\ncrusted black hair that curled around his ears and a thick, close\nbeard covering his chin. She hadn’t seen him this morning,\nand he refused to make Touraine’s job easier. She stood on\ntiptoes to loop the noose over his neck. The second person was\nthe young woman, less bullish, delicate even. The fight in her\nwas gone. She watched Touraine calmly and ducked into the\nnoose, murmuring under her breath.\nThe woman was praying. Touraine had studiously ignored\nSergeant Tibeau’s praying in the barracks long enough to\nrecognize the rhythms. Nearby, Cantic cleared her throat.\nTouraine shuddered and cinched the rope quickly, reciting to\nherself from the Tailleurist lessons: There are no gods, only\nsuperstitions. No superstition can harm you. And yet when\ntheir skin touched, Touraine felt a tingling sensation across her\nbody.\nShe got through the others as quickly as she could, trying\nto forget the feeling. Instead, she felt only the pressure of\neveryone’s eyes on her, and the tickle of her own sweat down\nher coat. The older man was the last one. He tried gamely to\nstand up straight. His shaggy gray hair hung in his face. It\nseemed like he’d aged decades since she’d met him at the\ndocks, smiling warmly with his camel. It wasn’t real, she told\nherself. He’d been a distraction, a pair of eyes. She pulled the"

As she tightened the rope, his\neyes narrowed at her, then popped wide.\n“You look just like—” the man rasped, working around his\ndry tongue. Louder, he rushed to get the words out. “You’re\nJaghotai’s daughter, aren’t you?”\nTouraine startled and looked to Pruett, who held the drop\nlever. Do it now! Touraine said with her eyes.\n“You’re Hanan?” The old man’s voice croaked from his\nthroat.\nTouraine staggered back at the sound of her old name. Her\nheart dropped into her gut like the gallows floor, and the air\ncaught in her lungs.\nThe old man dangled.\nExcept for a few desperate kicks, the prisoners hanged in\nsilence. Touraine saluted to Cantic and jogged down to stand\nin front of her soldiers as if nothing had happened. As if her\nheart wasn’t rattled in its cage. Her men and women formed a\ntight square, five by five. Sergeant Tibeau caught her eye. He\ndidn’t need words to send a cold drip of guilt sliding between\nher shoulder blades.\nThe world felt muffled and slow. Beyond Captain Rogan,\nGeneral Cantic had descended and left, leading the princess\ndown one spoke of road. The true-born Balladairan soldiers\nhad already marched to the Balladairan compound under their\nown captain’s orders.\nFor the first time in over twenty years, Touraine was back\nin Qazāl. She looked at the swinging bodies. The old man\njerked, and Touraine watched until he stilled.\nHow did he know who I am?\nRogan glanced at Touraine’s platoon and then over to the\nsand-storm with a satisfied smirk. “Welcome home, Sands.”\nWith a different prize every month,\nfrom advance copies of books by\nyour favourite authors to exclusive\nmerchandise packs,\nwe think you’ll find something\nyou love.\nfacebook.com/OrbitBooksUK\n@orbitbooks_uk\n@OrbitBooks\nwww.orbitbooks.net"
